"6.3        Clausal syntax
    Syntax in Kusunda follows a basic SV, AOV constituent order, the verb coming last.
This order is typologically pervasive throughout South Asia. In Kusunda, because the
person and number of the subject (S or A) referent is marked in the verb, the subject NP,
even as a pronominal form, is usually elided. This is in keeping with universal expectations
that in unmarked clauses, the subject is usually excluded from the scope of assertion
(Givón 1984, 1991). Where the subject NP does occur, especially in connected speech,      31
       We have not recorded “suffixing pattern 3” (§6.2.3) for all these verbs, though they may exist.
This needs further verification.",[95]

    (256)     tsi t -a -an
              I 1-go-IRR
              ‘I’ll go.’ (I’m volunteering)
              ‘I’ll go.’ (That’s what I’ll do)
    In general, however, more topical elements occur early and less topical ones later.
(The order in (256), then, is also a basic, unmarked order.) This is relevant to clauses
that have peripheral elements like time or location. Peripheral elements tend to attract the
focus of assertion. Thus, in (257a–c) the peripheral elements, time, place, and comitative,
occur closer to the verb than the pronominal referent. This is the least marked order:
    (257)     a. tsi pyana       ts-˙g-˙n
                 I   yesterday 1-go-REAL
                 ‘I went yesterday.’
              b. tsi da≥      t -a -an
                 I Dang 1-go-IRR
                 ‘I will go to Dang.’
              c. gina    tok-ma    u-g-i
                 he/she us-WITH come-3-PAST
                 ‘He/she came with us.’
    Where both peripheral elements occur – time and location – the element with closer
semantic ties to the verb occurs next to the verb, and the other element occurs as an
adverbial specification to the whole predication. This order mirrors the basic order for
transitive predications too – the object occurs next to the verb, and temporal elements
which occur outside the case frame also occur syntactically outside:
    (258)     a. INTRANSITIVE:
                 goraq       tsi da≥       t -a -an
                 tomorrow    I     Dang 1-go-IRR
                 ‘Tomorrow I will go to Dang.’
              b. TRANSITIVE:
                 pyana       tsi agai-da pumba-d-i
                 yesterday I      dog-ACC beat-1-PAST
                 ‘Yesterday I beat the dog.’    • Case marking. Case marking in Kusunda follows a basic nominative–accusative
alignment – S and A arguments are unmarked (nominative) and the O argument is
marked by the accusative suffix -da (see example (258b)). For more details and
examples, see §5.2.2.2.
    There are a few transitive verbs in Kusunda which appear to be “less-than-transitive”
– they have some of the morphosyntactic characteristics of intransitive verbs. ‘Climb,’
‘beg,’ and ‘fight,’ for example, all take intransitive imperative markers. All happen to be
non-accusative in case marking; that is, the notional object is marked by a locative ‘on’
for ‘climb’ and a comitative ‘with’ for ‘beg’ and ‘fight’. (See the discussion following
example (196).)
                                              96
7.       Transitivity alternations – causatives, anti-
         causatives, and reflexives
    There are a number of derivational operations by which intransitive verbs can be
made transitive, and transitive verbs made intransitive. We will deal here only with
morphological operations, leaving periphrastic causatives and other syntactic devices to
§9.2.","[95, 96, 97]"

3.      Linguistic type
     Kusunda is related to no other language or language family of South Asia; indeed,
as far as we can tell, to no other language on earth – it is a true linguistic “isolate”.
There are, to be sure, a few lexical borrowings from surrounding languages, both from
Indo-Aryan and from Tibeto-Burman. But all such borrowings are relatively recent and
have nothing to do with its genetic lineage.
     The status of some linguistic isolates can be extremely difficult to determine; such
languages may have been sufficiently influenced through long-term contact with
surrounding languages that they begin to resemble them both grammatically and lexically.
The original language provides only a substrate. Kusunda has not escaped at least some
such influence, but, by and large, it remains a typological isolate – i.e. it is phonologically,
lexically, and grammatically distinct. Thus, we can be reasonably safe in assuming that
throughout most of its history Kusunda developed in isolation, and only in recent times
has it had contact with other linguistic types.
     Phonologically, Kusunda possesses sounds that do not exist in other languages of
the region – namely, uvular and pharyngealized consonants. Conversely, there are
sounds found throughout the region, like retroflex consonants, that do not occur in
Kusunda. Furthermore, the point of articulation in Kusunda is more-or-less immaterial,
it is the active articulator that counts as contrastive.
     The uvular consonants are accompanied by the concomitant features of pharyngeal
stricture and lower fundamental frequencies on preceding vowels. Such features, in fact,
are often the primary auditory cues to their presence.
     The voicing contrast in Kusunda is neutralized in many consonants, having a lesser
functional load than in surrounding languages.
     Vowels in Kusunda occur partially in harmonic sets, an upper set comprising three
vowels and a lower set comprising three vowels. There is considerable free variation
between the two sets, and only in a few words can opposing vowels in upper and lower
sets be shown to be contrastive. This suggests that Kusunda may have at one time had a
simple, three vowel system – i, a, o.
     Consonant sounds in Kusunda occur at many points of articulation – bilabial, dental,
alveolar, palatal, retroflex, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, and glottal. Most of the points,
however, are non-contrastive, and there can sometimes be considerable variation even in
single words. What is more material for Kusunda, then, is to describe consonant
sounds in terms of their active articulator – labial, apical, laminal, velar, and uvular/pha-
ryngeal. An apical consonant, for example, can be dental, alveolar, or retroflex.
     One of the most striking and unusual aspects of Kusunda grammar is the means by
which “marked” structures are distinguished from “unmarked” ones. The “mark” is
not an affix, as typical of the region or indeed of the languages of the world, but rather, a
harmonic autosegmental process (which we will refer to as “mutation”) that spreads
“retraction” across the entire word. Apical consonants become laminal, velar consonants
become uvular, and vowels from the upper set shift to the lower set. The process
appears to be very old, and occurs today only in a very small subset of high frequency
verbs.
     Vestiges of this striking morphophonological process are still apparent in several
categories and may represent the morphologization of a single process in different
contexts – all ‘marked’ categories. Thus, the marked modality is irrealis (while the
unmarked category is realis); the marked polarity is negative; the marked transitivity is
                                              20

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––causative; and the marked dependency is dependent. All of these systems utilize mutation
as a mark (at least to a partial extent).
    There are very few case marking affixes in Kusunda, but an affix -da occurs as a
distinguishing morpheme in numerous systems. In some cases a single etymological
source can be plausibly inferred – -da is a local case marker, the marker of an animate
object in transitive clauses, and occurs in some complement clauses. In other cases,
different morphemes that just happen to be homophonous must be assumed – -da is a
plural number agreement in verbs, a marker of incompletive aspect, and a morphological
causative.
    Syntax in Kusunda follows a basic SV, AOV constituent order, with alternative
orders used to mark specialized pragmatic notions. This is common in the linguistic
area. Subject NPs are often deleted in running discourse, the person and number of the
subject actant being recoverable from obligatory person–number agreement markers in
the verb. In terms of grammatical case marking, Kusunda follows a nominative–accusative
case marking alignment – something unusual for the languages of the region.
    Verbs in Kusunda divide broadly into Class I and Class II. In Class I verbs, person
agreement is marked by prefixes and number by suffixes, whereas in Class II verbs both
person agreement and number is marked by suffixes. Class I verbs are old with a lot of
irregularity in the paradigms and an abundance of suppletive forms. The majority of
verbs belong to Class II. Such verbs can be thought of as “non-inflecting,” i.e. all
inflection falls on an auxiliary based on the verb ‘to make, to do.’ Class II intransitive
verbs are basically bereft of person marking, with a new, innovative person marking
distinction developing in some contexts.
    The basic TAM system in Kusunda makes a binary distinction between realis and
irrealis. Class II verbs have also developed a past tense distinction, a distinction that is
generally missing from Class I verbs.
    There are derivational operations in Kusunda whereby inherently intransitive verbs
can be made transitive, and inherently transitive verbs made intransitive – the latter a kind
of “middle” derivation. Both operations are morphological, and causativization always
yields a Class II verb. Periphrastic causatives are also possible, in which case the caused
event is embedded to the causativizing matrix verb ‘to make, to do.’
    Verb subordination (or embedding) occurs in numerous Kusunda structures – relative
clauses, verbal complements, periphrastic causatives, and applicatives. A striking feature
in Kusunda, unusual for the typology of the region, is that such embedded structures
appear not to be nominalized (although our so-called ‘neutral’ verbs are possible candidates
for nominalization; see §8.1 and §9.1.2). Most subordinate structures are fully finite
and their embedded status is signalled entirely by their syntax. (In mutating verbs,
subordination is also marked by mutation.)
    Some, but not all, clause chains in Kusunda are marked by converbs. Unusual,
however, is that converbs in Kusunda do not mark sequential events, but “overlapping”
ones. Sequential chains are marked by a series of fully finite verbs. Certain periphrastic
causatives, as well as some complements (like ‘teaching how to do something’) are
marked by overlapping converbs. A structure which on the surface looks deceptively
like the benefactive in surrounding languages, is, in fact, only an overlapping converbal
structure. The benefactive, at least for some non-inflecting (Class II) verbs, is marked
by the auxiliary ‘give’ in place of the auxiliary ‘make, do.’ In most cases, however, it
requires no derivational machinery and is formed simply by the addition of a dative
argument.","[19, 20, 21]"
"6.1.1.         Equative clauses
     The equative clause is most commonly expressed without a copula (though, as we
shall see, an infrequently used equative copula does exist). The construction is formed
by the juxtaposition of two noun phrases (NPs) without grammatical case marking. The
first NP in the sequence is the copula subject and the final NP is the copula complement.
The order of the elements has grammatical implications – the subject is the presupposed,
topical element, and the complement functions as the predicator, as in the following:
       (226)      a. n˙ti na
                     what this
                     ‘What is this?’
                  b. na gimi       tsi-yi
                     this money I-GEN
                     ‘This money is mine.’
                  c. gina k˙l˙m n˙ti-ye
                     that pen       who-GEN
                     ‘That pen is whose?’
                  d. na tsi kila-d-ßn         gimi
                     this I    steal-1-REAL money
                     ‘This is money that I stole.’
                  e. nu m˙b˙-n-i          gip˙n n˙tßn
                     you hear-2-PAST talk         what
                     ‘What is the matter/talk you heard?’
    A reordering of elements in any of these equative clauses makes for a slight difference
in meaning. A reording of (226d), for example, yields tsi kila-d-ßn gimi = na [I steal- 1-REAL
money = this] ‘The money I stole is this,’ in which ‘this’ is the predicator.",[85]

    In fact, like many languages of the region, the same morpheme that marks accusative
also marks “dative recipient” in bitransitive clauses and the subject in “dative subject”
clauses. The grammatical category, then, marks the “terminus” of a causal chain, and
might be better termed an “endpoint.” Following are examples of both:
   (114)     DATIVE RECIPIENT:
             a. gina-Ø    t˙n-da haq t˙mb˙-g-˙n
                he-NOM I-DAT letter send-3-REAL
                ‘He sent me a letter.’
             DATIVE SUBJECT:
             b. t˙n-da ida≥      kæaÚ u
                I-DAT hunger is:not
                ‘I am not hungry.’ (lit. ‘hunger is not to me’)
             c. t˙n-da tsya ts-oˆ -˙n          ola≥ ota≥
                I-DAT tea 1-drink-REAL tasty seems
                ‘To me drinking tea is tasty.’
    Note that the verb form in (114a) is identical to the form in (113d) even though one
functions in a transitive clause and the other in a bitransitive clause. (114a) adds a
“secondary object” letter, and -da marks the animate “primary object,” a notional
indirect object (Dryer 1986).
    In (114b–c), -da marks the “dative subject,” a well established pattern both in
Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman languages of the region (with the exception of Kham,
one of Kusunda’s immediate neighbors). Reinhard and Toba show this structure
without a dative subject.
    It is not known what semantic or pragmatic parameters delimit the use of -da in
transitive clauses, but it is clear that animacy plays a big role. We have numerous cases
of inanimate objects being unmarked, as in:
   (115)     a. tsi wi        a-t-ßn
                I house make-1-REAL
                ‘I built a house’ / ‘I make houses.’
             b. gina ta≥     kola-g-i
                he    water draw-3-PAST
                ‘He drew water.’   • The object marker -da as a ‘purposive’ marker. What may be regarded as the
same morpheme -da also marks embedded clauses of purpose (glossed in the examples
                                           52

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––as PURP). Here too, the “endpoint” of the eventuality named by the matrix verb is the
semantic notion being marked. The embedded verb retains many of its finite features,
and will be treated more fully in §8.2.3. In the meantime, we present the following
examples:
    (116)      a. t-˙m-da       t-ug-un
                  1-eat-PURP 1-come-REAL
                  ‘I came to eat.’
               b. tsi wi       ˙n-da         ol~aˆ -t-ßn
                  I house make-PURP want-1-REAL
                  ‘I want to build a house.’
   From the example in (116a) it is clear that the matrix verb need not be transitive to
warrant the felicitous use of -da. It is likely that the marker is more attuned to the
pragmatic notion of “endpoint” or “goal” than it is to the syntactic notion of transitive
“object.” Throughout this grammar we will continue to gloss -da as ACC, DAT, or
PURP, depending on its usage.","[51, 52, 53]"

1.      Introduction
    The Kusundas, also known as Ban Rajas “Kings of the Forest,” are an ethnic
group of Nepal who, until recent historical times, lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers
in central and midwestern Nepal. Nowadays, due to the loss of vast tracts of forest
lands their hunting bands have splintered and they have been compelled, because of a
lack of marriageable Kusunda partners, to intermarry with other ethnic groups. As a
result, their numbers have dwindled drastically and their language has all but ceased to
exist.
    Kusundas first came to the attention of the Western world in 1848 when Brian
Hodgson, the British Resident to the Court of Nepal, introduced them, together with the
Chepangs, in an article in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, On the Chépáng
and Kúsúnda tribes of Nepál, with the following words:
       Amid the dense forests of the central region of Népál, to the westward of the
       great valley, dwell, in scanty numbers and nearly in a state of nature, two broken
       tribes having no apparent affinity with the civilized races of that country, and
       seeming like fragments of an earlier population. (1848:650; 1874:45)
    His description is even less flattering a few sentences later when he goes on to say
that, “They have bows and arrows, of which the iron arrow-heads are procured from
their neighbors, but almost no other implement of civilization, and it is in the very skilful
snaring of the beasts of the field and the fowls of the air that all their little intelligence is
manifested.”
    Van Driem (2001) reports that according to Ralph Turner (1931), Kusunda was
formerly used as “a term of abuse for the so-called Rajputs of Nepal,” and may still be
used in the sense of “savage.” Reinhard, too (1976:2), notes that in some areas of
Nepal the word Kusunda makes reference to those who “do not listen to advice and
behave rudely.” In our own experience, the term still has some currency, especially in
western Nepal. Our informants, however, seemed either unaware or uncaring of its
pejorative overtones, and were quite happy to refer to themselves as Kusundas, although
they continue to refer to themselves by their autonym, mihaq ‘the people.’ (See §2.1,
paragraph 2 and fn. 5.)
    Nine years after his first mention of Kusunda, Hodgson, in his Comparative
Vocabulary of the Languages of the Broken Tribes of Nepal (1857), published a list of
Kusunda words, some 223 in all. Apparently the data was collected by linguistic
assistants, for in his own words he confessed that, “During a long residence in Népál, I
never could gain the least access to the Kusúndas, though aided by all the authority of
the Durbar” (part II, p. 46). The most important consequence of Hodgson’s list was
that it (should have) demonstrated unequivocally that Kusunda was unrelated to Chepang,
or for that matter, to any other language or language family of South Asia. (See
Appendix A for a full, modern vocabulary of about 850 words.) It seems that Robert
Shafer (1953) was the first to notice its unique status, almost one hundred years later.","[6, 7, 8, 9]"
"9.1.3       Case recoverablility strategies for relative clauses
    All relative clauses, whether they are “subject relative clauses” or “object relative
clauses,” are coded in the same ways – as neutral or as fully finite. There is no
morphological marker in the embedded verb to distinguish different types. Rather, the
distinction is based entirely on the identity of the role of the argument that occurs as the
head of the NP. Based on this criterion, we have at least three relative clause types in
our data set – a “subject relative clause,” an “object relative clause,” and a “locative
relative clause.”",[116]

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––5.1.4.      Demonstrative pronouns
    As far as we can tell, there are only two demonstrative pronouns in Kusunda – na
and ta. The distinction does not appear to be deictic, as in the usual “proximate” and
“distal” distinctions in both IA and TB languages of Nepal. Rather, the distinction
appears to be based on animacy, na being an animate demonstrative, and ta an inanimate
demonstrative. Here we repeat the examples in (101):
    (105)      a. n˙ti na
                  who this (animate)      ‘Who is this?’
               b. n˙ti ta
                  what this (inanimate)   ‘What is this?’
     Unfortunately, this generalization breaks down in many contexts, and the two terms
seem to be interchangeable, as in na pæurlu≥ tsu ‘This is red’ to refer to an inanimate
object. It is possible that na is the functionally unmarked member of the two.
     We are not aware of a way, using demonstrative pronouns, to distinguish between
‘this’ and ‘that.’ However, the third person pronoun sometimes occurs as a demonstrative,
and in that function appears to express a distal demonstrative ‘that’:
   (106)       gina k˙l˙m gina-yi
               that pen         he-GEN
               ‘That pen is his.’
    There are no plural demonstrative pronouns. Plurality in pronouns, like plurality in
nouns, can be marked in the NP by numerals or quantifiers, or by plural agreement
affixes in the verb. (See also §5.2.1.)5.2.     Nouns and noun morphology
    All nouns in Kusunda, as far as we currently know, have the same morphosyntactic
properties. The class is composed of prototypical nouns, concrete kinds of things that
can be manipulated and counted. Though they can be counted, none of them can be
pluralized. There is no nominal plural marker. This sets them apart from pronouns,
which we saw in §5.1.
    Another class of words that might be called “nominal” (though not so in this
grammar) are “action nouns.” This is a highly restricted class and occurs only in
constructions as a complement of the verb ‘to do’ – notions like ‘to do thinking’ or ‘to
do hitting.’ More than half of the verbs in Kusunda are formed from such elements.
Rather than referring to them as “nouns” in light verb constructions, however, we will
refer to them as “non-inflecting verbs.” They require the presence of an auxiliary verb
‘to do, make’ to carry the appropriate inflection. More investigation needs to be done
on their properties. (See §6.1.4.)
    In §5.2.2.3 we give some evidence, still weak, for a possible “locational” subclass
of nouns.","[48, 49]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––9.1.3.1      Subject relative clause
    In a subject relative clause the erstwhile subject is extracted and made head of a new
NP. The rest of the embedded clause, along with its predicate (a fully finite verb without
derivational morphology), modifies the new head noun, as in the following:
    (318)      a. d˙-g-˙n      nu       hampe
                  go-3-REAL person where
                  ‘Where is the person who went?’
               b. gimi    t˙mb˙-g-i      n˙ti
                  money send-3-PAST who
                  ‘Who sent the money?’ / ‘Who is the money sender?’
               c. h˙ra-q-ßn    aota
                  open-AC-REAL door
                  ‘open door’
               d. wi      ˙-g-i            nu
                  house make-3-PAST person
                  ‘the person who built the house’9.1.3.2      Object relative clause
    In an object relative clause the erstwhile object is extracted and made head of a new
NP. The rest of the embedded clause, along with its predicate (again, a fully finite verb
without derivational morphology), modifies the new head noun, as in the following:
    (319)      a. tsi k˙la-d-ßn        d˙idzi     kila-˙-g-˙n
                  I chop-1-REAL firewood steal-TR-3-REAL
                  ‘He stole the firewood I chopped.’
               b. nu pumb˙-n-i          ip˙n
                  you beat-2-PAST       corn
                  ‘corn that you beat (thrashed)’9.1.3.3      Locative relative clause
In a locative relative clause, a peripheral argument is made head of the noun phrase – in
this case a location, as in:
    (320)      hi o -da-g-i             tæ˙w˙
               pig die-CAUS-3-PAST place
               ‘the place where he killed a pig’9.1.4       Adjectivals
We include adjectivals under Adnominals and relative clauses because of their close
formal similarity. Some intransitive and detransitivized verbs can form adjectives by the
suffix -di. The derivation, however, seems not to be available to all intransitive verbs, and
it is not yet known what the parameters are. We give the following examples:
    (321)      a. hab-di
                  roast-ADJ             ‘roasted’
                                             117

                    boil-AC-ADJ        ‘boiled’
      We have two examples of -di acting as a formative for nominalization:
      (322)      a. kila-di
                    steal-NML          ‘thief’
                 b. sokso-di
                    black-NML          ‘black’
    Some intransitive verbs make use of a suffix -dzi for adjectivals. This is one of the
most puzzling suffixes we have encountered because of its occurrence in numerous and
varied contexts. Following are examples of its occurence in adjectival contexts:
      (323)      a. o -dzi
                    die-ADJ            ‘dead’
                 b. hyo-dzi
                    swell-ADJ          ‘swollen’
                 c. qai-dzi
                    dry-ADJ            ‘dry’
                 d. qau-dzi
                    spoil-ADJ          ‘spoiled, rotten’9.2       Periphrastic causatives
    In addition to the morphological causative discussed in §7.1.1 and §7.1.2, Kusunda
also has at least two periphrastic causatives. As with universal expectations, the periphrastic
causative implies less direct causation than the morphological causative. One of the
Kusunda periphrastic causatives implies that the event coded in the embedded clause
already occurred; whereas we are unsure of the level of implicature in the second
causative type.","[116, 117, 118]"
"4.2.         Contraction
    Another factor contributing to much difficulty in isolating Kusunda sounds has been
the Kusunda penchant for extreme contraction of sound strings. Prem Bahadur, the
speaker with the least native-speaker ability uses contraction least, and Kamala, the most
fluent speaker, uses contraction most. She compresses a lot of speech into fairly short,
highly assimilated, strings; not just in rapid speech, but in any register. We found
ourselves having to play one speaker off the next in order to effectively isolate the
sounds and morphemes in a given string. Phonological precision grew as the morphology
became more transparent. In our early transcriptions, for example, (supported by tape
recordings) our transcription from Kamala’s speech for ‘man’ (a male human being)
was:
       (5)       [dui˙Ôe]
which has now been modified to:
       (6)       [dui getse]
which in turn (possibly) comes from an earlier:
       (7)       *duktsi getse (lit. ‘boy child’)
       The contraction process is as follows:
       (8)      a. [duktsi getse] >
                b. [du i ˙Ôe]6
    The form duktsi itself is very like a contraction of an earlier *du getse [male child]
‘son.’ Thus, “hidden” in the compound dui˙Ôe are two, or even three, cycles of
phonological contraction.
    In Kamala’s speech, velar ‘g’ and uvular ‘ ’ are routinely lost, the loss of the latter
sound being compensated for by a kind of pharyngealization on the surrounding vowels
and a lowering of pitch (more on that later). It is also doubtful now that [z] or [Ô] are
phonemes at all in Kusunda, occurring only in intervocalic environments of compressed
speech as allophones of [ts] or [dz].
    The glossary that we include in this description has about 850 items, and it is very
likely that some are contractions of what may turn out to be, upon further investigation,
compounds and polymorphemic strings. We expect that, pending further research on
Kusunda, our wordlist will undergo considerable revision and refinement.",[23]

Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Transitivity alternations
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––      (280)     a. TRANSITIVE:
                   tsi amba dza-g˙ hab˙-d-ßn
                   I meat fire-IN burn-1-REAL
                   ‘I roasted meat in the fire.’
                b. INTRANSITIVE:
                   dza-g˙ ts-˙g-˙n         hab˙-tsi-n
                   fire-IN 1-go-REAL burn-1-REAL
                   ‘I went into the fire and got burned.’
    The intransitive version, illustrated in (280b), is passive in force and must be translated
in English as ‘got burned.’7.2.3.2       A “functional” passive
    In §8.1 we will discuss verbs that occur without person marking – our so-called
“neutral” inflection. In subordinate structures like the “purposive” clause, neutral
inflection on the subordinated verb indicates an identity of person (same subject) with
the matrix verb, as in the following:
      (281)     tok hyoq-ßn       ts-i-da-n
                we hide-NEUT 1-go-PL-REAL
                ‘We went to hide.’
   In Class I verbs, however, it is not normally possible to be rid of all person marking
– person marking occurs as a prefix. In such cases, the most neutral inflection is a
generic third person prefix (see §8.1.3), as in the following verb used in a modifying
function:
      (282)     g-˙m-˙n      kæaidzi
                3-eat-REAL food
                ‘eaten food’ / ‘food eaten by (someone)’
    In like manner, independent verbs in coordinate structures (see §11.1) can be interpreted
as having passive force where the medial “passive” verb is inflected as a generic third
person and the final verb is specific for person, as in:
      (283)     pyana       hul˙-g-˙n,      t˙~îna t-˙m-˙n
                yesterday cook-3-REAL, today 1-eat-REAL
                ‘Yesterday it was cooked, today I’ll eat it.’
   Many third person realis forms, pronounced as -˙g˙n by Gyani Maiya, are pronounced
simply as -˙n by Kamala, as in (284). (On this topic see also sections §4.4.4.1,
examples (63–64), and §9.1.2,1.)
      (284)     pyana       hul˙-n,      t˙~îna t-˙m-˙n
                yesterday cook-REAL, today 1-eat-REAL
                ‘Yesterday it was cooked, today I’ll eat it.’7.3       Reflexive
    The reflexive construction in Kusunda does not require detransitivizing morphology
in the verb, but relies on the reflexive pronoun gimdzi ‘self.’ The reciprocal uses the
same mechanism, but with two occurrences of the reflexive pronoun, as in:                                             104
                                       Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––   (285)     a. REFLEXIVE:
                gimdzi pæo-˙-g-˙n
                self     beat-TR-3-REAL
                ‘He hit himself.’
             b. RECIPROCAL:
                gimdzi gimdzi o -da-˙-g-˙i
                self     self     die-CAUS-TR-3-PAST
                ‘They killed each other.’
    This is not to say that detransitivized constructions are not compatible with the
reflexive pronoun; they are. If, however, the speaker wishes to express that the agent
acted on him/herself, the construction requires a fully transitive verb, as in the examples
of (285). Used with intransitive constructions, inherent or derived, the reflexive pronoun
only signifies that the eventuality named by the verb happened without outside agency
(not that it acted upon itself):
   (286)     ANTICAUSATIVE WITHOUT REFLEXIVE PRONOUN:
             a. gagri pæiru-t-ßn
                jug     fill-AC-REAL
                ‘The jug filled.’
             ANTICAUSATIVE WITH REFLEXIVE PRONOUN:
             b. gagri gimdzi pæiru-t-ßn
                jug    self       fill-AC-REAL
                ‘The jug filled on its own.’
             c. tsi a-d-aÚ u,      ip˙n gimdzi suml-˙-q-ßn
                I do-1-NEG, corn self                break-TR-AC-REAL
                ‘I didn’t do it, the corn broke by itself.’
    The same reflexive pronoun is used to indicate exclusive ownership, in which case
the reflexive pronoun precedes the possessed item, as in:
   (287)     a. gina    gimdzi gimdzi wi-nu         t-ei-dzi
                he/she self      self    house-TO go-PL-TAM (?)
                ‘They each go to their own houses.’
             b. nu   ni-gimdzi wa        ¯-a -an
                you 2S-self       home 2-go-IRR
                ‘You will go to your own home.’
                                           105
8.         Morphology of subordinate structures
    Clauses which are subordinated or embedded in other structures – adnominals in
relative clauses, sentential complements, periphrastic causatives, purposive clauses and
the like – are cast in one of three basic construction types. In one, the verb is cast in a
“neutral” non-finite form without person marking; in another, the subordinated verb
root is marked by a suffix -da; and in a third type the subordinate verb is fully finite.
None of the structures appear to have any kind of nominalizing morphology, although it
might be argued that the presence of -da is sufficient evidence to assume some kind of
nominalization – -da is also an NP object marker (see §5.2.2.2).3 3
    Lack of nominalized structures makes Kusunda typologically exceptional. Languages
of the region, both Nepali and TB languages like Kham, nominalize all sorts of embedded
clauses, and in some TB languages there are multiple types of nominalization.
    Here we will explore the basic morphological structure of subordinate structures and
talk later (in §9) about how they function within hosting structures. Though presented
from different points of view, there will necessarily be some overlap.","[103, 104, 105, 106]"
"    • The comitative. The comitative marks a notion of association, or doing an action
with another actant, as in the following:
   (123)     gina-ma     tsi ts-˙g-˙n
             he-WITH I       1-go-REAL
             ‘I went with him.’
   As in most other languages of the region, the comitative also marks possession, as in
‘With me is one rupee’ meaning ‘I have one rupee.’
   (124)     tsi-ma    qasti tsi/tsu
             I-WITH one is
             ‘I have one.’ (lit. ‘with me is one’)
    The language is ambivalent in how it interprets -ma. As a location, it collocates with
the locational copula tsi. As a possessive, it collocates with the existential copula tsu.
    In “reciprocal” kinds of verbs, -ma marks the reciprocal actant. Such verbs, mor-
phologically, behave like intransitives, as in:
   (125)     tsi gina-ma       limu-tsi-n
             I     he-WITH     fight-1-REAL
             ‘I fought with him.’
   There is at least one bitransitive verb in Kusunda in which -ma marks the “source.”
                                           55
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––The verb is ‘beg,’ as in:
       (126)   tsi-ma   gimi     ai-dzi       d-˙g-˙i
               I-WITH money beg-3:PAST 3-go-PAST
               ‘He begged money from me and left.’ (lit. ‘with me’)    • The “benefactive”. What we refer to here as the “benefactive” is a case marker
that occurs on NPs without concomitant valence adjusting modifications on the verb.
For details on the latter kind of benefactive construction, see §10.2.3. Here, the benefactive
case marker is based on the Nepali ko lagi, as in the following:
       (127)   tsi-lage limu-dzi
               I-FOR fight-3:PAST
               ‘He fought for me.’    • Comparative. The comparative in Kusunda is based on the Nepali bæ˙nda, as in
the following:
       (128)   na bæ˙nda ~oˆ ˙n o -da-n
               this than       big     come-PL-REAL
               ‘Bigger than this come.’ (in reference to mosquitos)    • Instrumental. It seems strange that we have been unable to elicit an instrumental
marker. All attempts have yielded nothing. Reinhard and Toba list a morpheme -ya as
the instrumental. Following is an example of the lack of an instrumental:
       (129)   na kæurpa-Ø kis˙-g-˙n
               this knife         cut-3-REAL
               ‘This is cut by a knife.’ / ‘(He) cut this with a knife.’
    (See §8.1 for the “neutral” conjugation of this verb – something that yields an
intransitive reading.)5.3.       Locative postpositions
    Most locative postpositions are specialized nouns that specify some kind of location
– notions like ‘on top of,’ ‘beside,’ etc. Some have referred to such nouns as “relator
nouns” (Starosta 1985; Watters 2002). Where these nouns still function elsewhere in
the grammar as full nouns with their original, literal sense, their nominal source is
transparent. In other cases, the word ceases to function as a full noun, and serves only
in a locative function.
    A transparent case of a noun serving as a postposition is the word for ‘behind,’
s˙mba derived from s˙mba ‘buttocks.’ (See fn. 21.) The word has a temporal function,
too, meaning ‘after’ or ‘later.’
    That many such words are basically nouns can be shown by the fact that they are
capable of supporting the genitive or the locative case marking suffixes shown in §5.2.2.
Thus, for example, a~o ‘inside’ and b~adza ‘outside’ can take the ablative in the same way
that ‘house’ can take the ablative. Thus, we can get:
       (130)   a. a~o-˙na      b~adza   ˙g-a
                  inside-ABL outside come-IMP
                  ‘Come out from the inside!’                                              56
                                       Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––             b. wi-yi          b~adza
                house-GEN outside
                ‘outside the house’ / ‘the house’s outside’
    Other words that are probably nouns, though we do not have enough data to prove it,
are the following:
   (131)     a.   gidzaq         ‘between’
             b.   kampya         ‘to one side’
             c.   pinda          ‘in front of’
             d.   a k˙           ‘on top of, above’ (see the spectogram under §4.3.2)
    The last word, (131d), also occurs in our elicitation lists as the noun for ‘sky.’
Again, we are dealing with a noun that has become grammaticalized as a locational
postposition. Likewise, pinda in (131c) can be used to mean ‘first,’ as in pinda duksi
‘the first/eldest son.’
    We have two lexemes for ‘down, below, or under,’ and another two for ‘up, or
above.’ We have nothing to indicate what the difference might be. The words are:
   (132)     a. aqa              ‘down, below, under’
             b. ama a            ‘down, below, under’
   (133)     a. n~oˆ dze         ‘up, above’
             b. a~ ˆ dze         ‘up, above’
   Another three locational nouns are the following:
   (134)     a. akp˙i            ‘across’
             b. asne             ‘uphill’
             c. paÚtse           ‘downhill’    • Deictic pronouns/locatives. There may be a three-way deictic distinction – prox-
imate, distal, remote – in the Kusunda deictic locatives, but we have been unable to verify
this.
    There are two sets, one for static location and another for “direction to.” The three
forms in each set do not form regular paradigms, the individual members being suppletive.
The forms ape ‘there,’ tape ‘to there,’ and sape ‘to here’ may have formed a paradigm
at one time in the language, but in the modern language the forms are semantically
disparate. The modern paradigms are as follows (it is not known how (135b) and
(135c) differ):
   (135)     STATIC:
             a. t˙isa            ‘here’
             b. ape              ‘there’
             c. nupa             ‘there’
   The locatives in (135) occur with verbs like ‘sit’ or ‘sleep’ in constructions like ‘Sit
here!’ or ‘Sleep there!’
   (136)     DYNAMIC:
             a. tape             ‘to here’
             b. t˙wa             ‘to here’
             c. sape             ‘to there’                                              57

   The locatives in (136) occur with verbs that include motion – like ‘Come here!’ or
‘Go there!’ or even ‘Give it here!’ We have examples of both tape and t˙wa occurring
with the command ‘Come here!’5.4.    Adjectives
    Like Indo-Aryan, but unlike Tibeto-Burman, Kusunda has a distinct “adjective”
class. That is, the property notions of “size,” “shape,” “color,” etc., form an inherent
class of words not derived from other word classes (as with the class of stative verbs in
TB). This does not mean, of course, that the class of adjectives in Kusunda matches the
class of adjectives in any other language. There are several words that occur as adjectives
in English, for example, that occur as verbs in Kusunda. ‘Fat,’ for example, is a verb in
Kusunda, but an adjective in English. (See also §9.1.4 for derived Adjectivals.)
    Adjectives in Kusunda, when occurring in a modifying function, precede the noun
they modify, and in a predicative function they occur with the existential copula tsu (or
kæaÚu, its negative counterpart). Following are examples:
   (137)     MODIFICATION:
             a. huigin ta≥       pokæla-yin
                dirty   water bathe-PROH
                ‘Don’t bathe in dirty water!’
             b. tsi ˙gi tu          ts-~aˆ -dzi
                I    live snake 1-see-PAST
                ‘I saw a live snake.’
             c. h~ukun suta      bæ˙ra-q-ßn
                small thread break-AC-REAL
                ‘The small thread broke.’
   (138)     PREDICATION:
             a. na    amba ola≥ tsu
                this meat tasty is
                ‘This meat is tasty.’
             b. tsi gya ai tsu, gina-ma           limu-tsi-n
                I    strong     am, he-WITH fight-1-REAL
                ‘I am strong, I fought with him.’
             c. nu ta       kam     ˙n wey˙n kæaÚ u
                you this work do good              not
                ‘It’s not good for you to do this work.’
    We spent very little time studying adjectives, and may encounter surprises in a later
study. One thing that did catch our attention was the paucity of basic color terms –
black, white, and red. Even the simplest TB systems have a four-term system – black,
white, red, and green. Still, black, white, and red are the colors predicted by Berlin and
Kay’s (1969) study for a three-term system.
    Yellow and green are also possible in Kusunda, but only as secondary innovations.
Yellow, as in some of the TB languages of the region,2 3 is based on the color of tumeric
powder. The Kusunda word for tumeric is k˙p˙≥, and ‘yellow’ is k˙p˙≥ b˙yo. The

contexts.
    Our informants, for several weeks, claimed that Kusunda had no word for ‘green.’
Eventually, they produced the word h˙rgun, which appears to be related to Nepali
h˙riyo. The likelihood of this being true is more convincing in the light of a second
word for ‘red’ – kæ˙rgun – based on a Kham corruption of the Nepali word for ‘rust.’
In Kham the word for ‘reddish-brown’ is kæ˙iryaso ‘rust-like.’ The words h˙r-gun and
kæ˙r-gun, then, may mean something like ‘har-like’ (from Nepali ‘green’) and ‘kæ˙r-like’
(from Kham ‘reddish-brown’). The words for ‘black’ and ‘white’ respectively are
soksodi ~ soksog˙r˙m and kasige.
    The Kusunda word for ‘bad’ stands out as unique in the languages of the region.
In both IA and TB, ‘bad’ is commonly expressed only as NEG-good. In Kusunda,
‘bad’ qolom is a separate lexical item from ‘good’ wey˙n.
    Most verbs, too, can be used in a modifying function. For a treatment of these, see
§9.1 on Adnominals and relative clauses.","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59]"
"5.5.1.1.    Prefixing patterns (Class I)
    Verbs are marked for the person (first, second, or third) and number (singular or
plural) of the subject argument. There is no object agreement. Person and number are
separate indices. Class I verbs are defined as those in which person is marked by
prefixes and number is marked by suffixes.
    The underlying syllable shape of the verb root appears to have at least some bearing        In Kham, for example, the word for tumeric is borrowed from Nepali h˙lid˙, and ‘yellow’ is
    23built off that word – h˙lidyaso ‘tumeric-like.’                                               59

roots that begin in a vowel, and the suffixing pattern occurs primarily on verb roots that
begin in a consonant. Thus, the (a) forms in (139) and (140) illustrate the rule, and the
(b) forms illustrate the exception:

     In general, first person agreement is signaled by ts- or t- in the first prefix slot,
second person by n- in the same slot, and third person by g-, d-, or zero. Plural number
is indicated by a suffix -da immediately following the root. Following are examples of
all persons and all numbers for ‘eat,’ ‘sleep,’ ‘come,’ and ‘go’ in realis mode:

            --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     The verbs ‘eat’ and ‘sleep’ are the most regular of the four verbs shown in (141)
and will serve as our starting point. The first element, a prefix, is t-/ts-, n-, or g-
according to whether the actant is first, second, or third person, respectively. The forms
are clearly based on the shape of the free pronouns tsi ‘I,’ nu ‘you,’ and gina ‘he, she,
it.’ The determination of first person ts- vs. t- is purely lexical and cannot be determined
by rule – phonological, grammatical, or otherwise.
     Other Class I verbs with first person ts- are the following: ts-oˆ-˙n ‘I drank,’
ts-o)-on ‘I put,’ etc. Other Class I verbs with first person t- are the following:
t-o)-˙n ‘I died,’ t-uk-an ‘I knew,’ etc.
     With the third verb, ‘come,’ the pronominal agreement forms are t-, n-, or Ø, and
with the final verb, ‘go,’ the forms are ts-, n-, and (seemingly) d-. In the latter case,
however, though d- possibly fills a person slot in the synchronic grammar, historically it
is the first element of the root and still surfaces in certain forms like the imperative – da
‘Go!’ D- as a third person marker, then, can be discounted on historical grounds.
     Again, as in first person ts- vs. t-, the determination of third person g- vs. Ø is lexical
and cannot be determined by rule. Other Class I verbs with third person Ø- are the
following: o)-˙n ‘he died,’ uk-an-dzi ‘he knows,’ etc. Many others take g-.
     Class I verbs are generally messy, with many irregular and suppletive forms. This is
very likely a consequence of their considerable age and maintained by high frequency

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––usage. A case in point are the plural forms for ‘go’ – ts-i÷-da-n ‘I went’ and n-i÷-da-n
‘You went.’ The vocalism [i] in the plural root [i÷] cannot be explained in the synchronic
grammar and nothing of the original root da remains. We end up with a suppletive
form.2 4
    Another irregular verb is the verb ‘sit,’ with first person s-, second person ¯-, and
third person h-, as in the following:
    (142)        1s    s-~aˆ an           ‘I sit.’
                 1p    s-~aˆ an           ‘We sit.’
                 2s    ¯-~aˆ an           ‘You sit.’
                 2p    ¯-~aˆ an           ‘You [pl] sit.’
                 3s    h-~aÚdzi           ‘He/she sits.’
                 3p    h-~aÚdei           ‘They sit.’
    It is possible that the underlying root in this case has an /h/ onset. The /h/ emerges
also in the imperative, as in: h~aˆ-no ‘Sit!’5.5.1.2.    Suffixing patterns (Class II)
    In contrast to Class I verbs, Class II verbs are characterized by person marking
suffixes. The majority of verbs in Kusunda belong to this class.","[59, 60, 61]"
"4.4.5.     Liquids, flaps, glides, etc.
   Kusunda has the liquid [l], the flap [r], and glides [y] and [w]. Following are
examples:
    (83)     LIQUID:
             a.   la an          ‘village’
             b.   ligin          ‘nettle, burlap’
             c.   balßn          ‘descend’
             d.   dz˙g˙l         ‘old woman’
    (84)     FLAP:

             d.   k~aw˙r         ‘light weight’
    Glides (semi-vowels) occur as non-peak elements in vocalic sequences belonging to
the same syllable, as in:
    (85)     GLIDES:
             a.   ye≥gu          ‘stone’

5.         Word classes
     The major word classes, noun, verb, and adjective are well represented in Kusunda.
We will deal with them one at a time in this section with a separate sub-section for
pronouns. We will also look at some minor word classes, like adverbs, numerals, and
question words. We were unable to determine the extent to which Kusunda makes use
of “ideophones” or “rhyming couplets” for modifying verbs. This is a category of
the type in which basic verbs like ‘go’ are modified by ideophonic adverbs to mean
things like ‘saunter,’ ‘stomp away,’ ‘go in long strides,’ etc. The phonomenon is well
represented in the region, both in Indo-Aryan and Tibeto-Burman languages. The
category needs study in Kusunda; indeed, it has not yet been determined if it exists at
all.","[43, 44]"
"5.2.2.3.    Local case markers
     In our data set, only three locative case markers have emerged. Reinhard and Toba
list more, though some of them are suspect. The so-called “preposition” inside, for
example, given as gem˙t, is very likely the word for ‘stomach.’2 1
     None of the locative case markers appear to be obligatory, especially if the semantic
connection is sufficiently understood by the collocation of the verb and the locational
noun. This may constitute some evidence for a separate “locational” subclass of nouns
(see §5.2).
    (117)      a. goraq      tsi da≥      t -a -an
                  tomorrow I      Dang 1-go-IRR
                  ‘Tomorrow I will go to Dang.’
               b. dzæola g-o -on
                  bag     3-put-REAL
                  ‘He put it in the bag.’    • The locative -da. The marker -da, discussed in §5.2.2.2 as an accusative, marks
at least one other kind of relationship, a locative one. The marker occurs rarely, but
seems to occur almost obligatorily on the word for ‘road’2 2 and also commonly on the
word for ‘forest.’
    (118)      a. un-da        myaq       p˙rm˙-d-i      qæai-tsi-n
                  road-LOC leopard meet-1-PAST afraid-1-REAL
                  ‘I met a leopard on the road and was frightened.’    21
       The word for stomach can, of course, serve as a ‘relator noun’ for inside in the same way that
the word for buttocks in our data serves as a relator noun for behind. Very likely it is a kind of noun.
See §5.3.
    22
        It appears possible that the frequent combination un ‘road’ and -da ‘locative’ may be the source
for the verb ‘to show’ unda a-d-i [show do-1-PAST] ‘I showed it.’                                                  53

   Notice that in (118b), -da occurs twice. In its second occurrence it marks what
appears to be an inanimate object – ‘road.’ In fact, we are interpreting it as a locative
marker. Recall that -da is obligatory on most occurrences of ‘road.’
   Comparing locative -da with locative -ga (following), the distinction may be that -da
marks distal, diffuse locations, while -ga marks nearby, specific locations.","[53, 54]"
"10.1    Sequential events
    Sequential events occur in temporal chronology – Having eaten he left is an example;
eating occurs first and leaving second. Kusunda has such sequences, but all verbs in the
chain – medial and final – are fully finite. Furthermore, medial verbs have no special
marker to distinguish them from final verbs. As such, these are “co-ranking” structures
(Longacre 1985) and differ from the “co-subordinate” structures we will look at in
§10.2. Following are examples:

Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Clause chaining
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    All of the sequences above retain the same subject for both verbs and would occur in
other languages of the region as classic clause chains – the first verb would occur as a
non-finite medial verb (plus linking morphology), and only the final verb would occur as
fully finite with person inflection. English, too, would treat all the sentences in (342) as
“same-subject” chains by deleting the second pronoun — ‘You hid and you slept.’
    The kinds of sequences illustrated in (342) are not formally different from the
coordinated structures we will look at in §11.1. The only difference, if any, might be
based on semantic inferences. The structures here were elicited as sequential chains
(using Nepali -er˙), while the structures in §11.1 were elicited as non-chains like After I
eat I will go.","[125, 126]"
"6.1.2.1      Existence

location” and “location.” The former expresses that something exists in a given
location, like ‘In the tree is a monkey,’ whereas the latter focuses on the actual location
of a given referent, as in ‘The monkey is in the tree.’ The existential copula is used
primarily to express the former – existence in a location. Pure existence, as in any
language, is rare in Kusunda:
    (231)      a. tsi-˙i      tsu
                  my-father exist
                  ‘My father is’ / ‘My father is living’ / ‘I have a father.’
               b. wu     tsi-˙i       tsu
                  home my-father exist
                  ‘My father is (at) home.’
               c. yi-g˙ ha o           tsu
                  tree-IN monkey exist
                  ‘In the tree is a monkey’ / ‘There is a monkey in the tree.’
               d. tu       dukæu tsu
                  snake two        exist
                  ‘There are two snakes.’
                  (tsi would mean ‘Two snakes are there’ / ‘There are two snakes there’)6.1.2.2      Negative existential
    The negative existential is kæaÚu. We noted earlier (see the discussion following
example (74) and §5.5.4.1) that the actual negative sequence is -aÚu, with pharyngealization
on the first vowel and falling-rising pitch on the full sequence. This suggests that the
original negative sequence is something like -a)u, with kh-a)u as the negative existential.
This leaves kh- as the negative existential verb root, a suppletive form with no apparent
relationship to tsu. Following are examples:
    (232)      a. ta≥     tsu
                  water exist
                  ‘There is water.’
               a. ta≥     kæ-aÚ u           < kæ-a     u
                  water neg.exist-not
                  ‘There is no water.’
                                              87

    As reflected in the glosses in (231a) pure existence is rare, and used in conjunction
with possessive clauses, the interpretation is one of possession – ‘I have a father’
(though the literal translation is ‘My father is’). Following are examples of typical
possessive clauses:
   (233)     a. tsi-h~ukui dahat tsu
                my-small three exist
                ‘I have three children.’ (lit. ‘my little ones three exist’)
             b. nu-ma     ˙si         tsu?
                you-WITH how.many exist
                ‘How many do you have?’ (lit. ‘with you how many exist?’)
             c. tsi-ma    qasti tsu
                I-WITH one exist
                ‘I have one.’ (lit. ‘with me one exists’)
    Negative possession uses the same negative existential verb that we saw earlier –
kæaÚu. Following is an example:
   (234)     tsi-h~ukui qasti b˙        kæaÚ u
             my-little   one even is.not
             ‘I don’t have even one child.’6.1.2.4    Dative subject constructions
    In “dative subject constructions” feelings/emotions/pain are construed as existing
‘to’ a referent, as in ‘Hunger is to me.’ In terms of syntax, the construction is similar to
the possessive clause construction, the major difference being in the marking of the
topical argument – ‘with me’ in possessive clauses, and ‘to me’ in dative clauses.
   (235)     t˙n-da    ida≥         tsu
             me-DAT hunger exist
             ‘I am hungry.’ (lit. ‘hunger is to me’)
   The negative uses the same existential negative kæaÚu that we saw earlier:
   (236)     t˙n-da     ida≥        kæaÚ u
             me-DAT hunger is.not
             ‘I am not hungry.’ (lit. ‘hunger is not to me’)6.1.2.5    Predicate adjective
    The “predicate adjective” construction – ‘He is tall,’ ‘I am big,’ etc. – predicates
adjectival notions through the help of the existential copula tsu, as in:
   (237)     a. na pæurlu≥ tsu
                this red       is
                ‘This is red.’
             b. tsi-h~ukui li≥wa tsu
                my-small heavy is
                ‘My child is heavy.’                                            88
                                       Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    The negative uses the same existential negative kæaÚu we saw earlier:
               c. tsi-h~ukui li≥wa kæaÚ u
                  my-small heavy is.not
                  ‘My child is not heavy.’
               d. ben amba ola≥ kæaÚ u
                  raw meat tasty is.not
                  ‘Raw meat is not tasty.’
   The predicate adjective construction is also used to predicate attributes designated by
“participles” (here partially-finite adnominals), as in the following:
    (238)      a. suta    bæ˙ra-q-ßn      tsu
                  string break-AC-REAL is
                  ‘The string is broken.’
               b. k˙re k˙la-q-ßn           lan tsu
                  pot break-AC-REAL like is
                  ‘The pot is about to break.’ (lit. ‘is like it will break’)
    As shown in (228a), the adjective can occur also without the copula, in which case it
is interpreted as a nominal in an equative clause – ‘I am a small person.’ (See also
(230).)6.1.3       Locational copula
    The locational copula is used to predicate the location of a referent – it is in such and
such a place. It differs from the existential copula, in that the latter expresses that the
referent exists, whether explicitly in a place or not.
    The locational copula is tsi in the positive and kæaÚi in the negative. Recall that the
negative existential was kæaÚu. Contrasting kæaÚu with kæaÚi we have further evidence
that the sequences were originally tri-morphemic – kæ-a)-u versus kæ-a)-i. Following
are examples:
    (239)      POSITIVE:
               a. tsi tsi
                  I loc.copula                      ‘I am (here).’
               b. tsi t˙isa     tsi
                  I here        loc.copula          ‘I am here.’
               c. nu tsi?
                  you loc.copula                    ‘Are you (there)?’
               d. nu isna         tsi?
                  you there       loc.copula        ‘Are you there?’
    (240)      NEGATIVE:
               a. ha o     yi-g˙         kæaÚ i
                  monkey tree-LOC loc.neg
                  ‘The monkey is not (located) in the tree.’
                                               89
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Basic clause types
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––               b. gina     kæaÚ i
                  he/she loc.neg
                  ‘He is not (there).’
    Notice that sentences (239a) and (239b) are very nearly synonymous, as are (239c)
and (239d). What is implied in sentence (a) and (c) is made explicit by a locative adverb
in (b) and (d). Notice, too, how this copula contrasts with the existential copula.
Following are contrastive examples:
    (241)      a. EXISTENTIAL:
                  yi-g˙       ha o      tsu
                  tree-LOC monkey exist
                  ‘In the tree is a monkey.’ / ‘There is a monkey in the tree.’
               b. LOCATIONAL:
                  ha o    yi-g˙       tsi
                  monkey tree-LOC loc.copula
                  ‘The monkey is in the tree.’
    In §5.2.2.4, example (124), we saw that in possessive clauses marked by the comitative
-ma ‘with,’ both existential and locational locatives can be used felicitously. Where the
existential is used the assertion is concerned with the existence of the item; where the
locational is used the assertion is concerned with the location of the item:
    (242)      a. EXISTENTIAL POSSESSIVE:
                  tsi-ma gimi     tsu
                  I-WITH money exist
                  ‘I have some money on me.’ (lit. ‘money exists with me.’)
               b. LOCATIONAL POSSESSIVE:
                  tsi-ma gimi      tsi
                  I-WITH money loc.copula
                  ‘I have money.’ (lit. ‘money is located with me.’)6.1.4       The inchoative and the causative
    The inchoative and the causative are treated here as subtypes of copular constructions
because 1) they serve frequently as verbs in “light verb” constructions (i.e. where the
real predication is done by a nominal and the verb is semantically empty), 2) they have
an intransitive–transitive paradigmatic relationship to one another, and 3) they form the
basis for verbal conjugation in “non-inflecting verbs” (see §5.5.1.2). Following are
some light verb constructions, all transitive, and all of which utilize the verb ‘to do,’ as in
the following:
    (243)      a. p˙idzi bun˙       ˙-g-˙n
                  cloth    weave do-3-REAL
                  ‘She is weaving cloth.’ (lit. ‘does weaving’)
               b. tap       gimi     gwa ˙-g-˙n
                  chicken female egg do-3-REAL
                  ‘The hen layed an egg.’ (lit. ‘did an egg’)                                               90

                I drum         do-1-PAST
                ‘I beat the drum.’
    There is some question about whether there is a phonological distinction between the
inchoative ‘become’ and the causative ‘make.’ Under careful articulation we recorded
distinct paradigms, but on the following day our informants would often give either
interpretation for either paradigm. There may be a single ambi-transitive verb with the
interpretation based on pragmatics. It is difficult to say at this stage. Nevertheless, we
give here two separate paradigms:
   (244)     INCHOATIVE (‘become’)               CAUSATIVE (‘make’)
             a. PAST:
                 1s ˙-d-i                           1s a-d-i

                3p                                  3p ˙-g˙-n
             c. IRREALIS:
                1s ˙-d-u                            1s a-d-u
                1p ˙-d˙-i                           1p a-d˙-k
                2s ˙-n-u                            2s a-n-u
                2p ˙-n˙-k                           2p a-n˙-k
                3s ˙-g-u                            3s a-g-u
                3p ˙-g˙-k                           3p a-g˙-k
    We have a few sentences in our corpus in which there is a clear distinction between
“inchoative” and “causative” roots:
   (245)     tsi mo≥ ˙-d-u                   s˙h˙r a-d-u
             I king become-1-IRR:SG city            make-1-IRR:SG
             ‘I will become king and I will make a city.’
    The status of the inchoative realis is confusing, with what appears to be a lot of
variation, and we can say nothing substantive about it.
    As we have shown earlier (see §5.5.1.2), Class II transitive conjugations are patterned
after the “causative” paradigm, i.e. based on the auxiliary verb ‘to do, make,’ as in the
following contrastive examples (‘do’ marks the Class II auxiliary verb root):
                                            91

                ‘I carried it.’                    ‘I cooked it.’
    Where the verb root ends in a consonant, (246b), or in a vowel radically different
from the first vowel [a] of the causative root ‘make,’ (246c), the causative root surfaces
unscathed – a-t-ßn [make-1-REAL]. Where the verb root ends in [˙] or [a], the two vowels
tend to coalesce, as in (246d).
    We have a few examples in which the inchoative version of the verb root [˙-] can be
used in a kind of “passive” sense, but this is almost expecting too much of the
distinction between [˙] and [a] where the distinction is almost non-existent elsewhere.
The construction is rare in our corpus and needs more research. Following are examples:
   (247)     a. tsya d˙baq ˙-g-u
                tea later      be-3-IRR:SG
                ‘Tea will be made later.’

                he    tea later       cook make-3-IRR:SG
                ‘He/she will cook tea later.’
    The difference between the verb in (247b) hul˙ ˙-g-u and its active counterpart in
(247c) hul˙ a-g-u is so minimal that the contrast may depend more on contrastive syntax
than anything else – the “passive” version is without an agent.","[87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]"
"11.1    Coordination
    Where the person reference in both verbs of a co-ranking structure is identical we
get something equivalent to coordination, especially where there is also continuity of
time reference between the two verbs. We looked briefly at coordination in §10.1, but
there we were contrasting it with co-subordinate strucures; here we contrast coordination
with other co-ranking structures. Following are examples of coordination, translated by
English ‘and’:
    (359)     a. wa     u-g-i         ip-dzi
                 home come-3-PAST sleep-3:PAST
                 ‘He came home and slept.’
              b. hyoq-ts-in     ts-ip-ßn
                 hide-1-REAL 1-sleep-REAL
                 ‘I hid and slept.’
    Thus, though in Kusunda, the person and number of the subject is marked on both
verbs, their English translations elide the second pronominal reference, as in: He came
home and slept. The same Kusunda sentences could also be translated as, for example,
‘He came home, he slept’ or ‘He came home and he slept.’ Subject continuity allows,
but does not require, the elided translations given in (359). (The sentences were originally
elicited as sequential chains using Nepali -er˙, hence, the same subject in both verbs and
their English translations.)    • The adversative. The adversative is based entirely on semantic inference. It has a
basic coordinate structure, but one in which the second event of the bi-clausal structure
can be thought of as an unexpected outcome of the first event:
    (360)     tsi yu≥-tsi-n           ts-ip-daÚ u
              I lie.down-1-REAL 1-sleep-REAL:NEG
              ‘I laid down, (but) I didn’t sleep.’

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––11.1.1      Discontinuity of person reference
    Where two verbs in a sequence are marked for different subjects, a disjunction of
events is implied by the two verbs in the co-ranking structure, as reflected in the following
translations (here the second pronoun cannot be elided):
    (361)     a. t˙n-da   un     unda-g-i        t-ug-un
                 me-ACC road show-3-PAST 1-come-REAL
                 ‘He showed me the road and I came.’
              b. nu n-ug-un            tsi hyoq-ts-in
                 you 2-come-REAL I         hide-1-REAL
                 ‘You came and I hid.’
    In examples (359–361) all verbs were cast in past time – either as realis or past
tense. In the following example both clauses are in future time, but with the same
discontinuity of person reference. Here, the second clause implies “reason”:
    (362)     t˙n-da    t˙mba-yin,       tsi un    meÚ-d-u
              me-ACC send-PROH, I road lose-1-IRR:SG
              ‘Don’t send me, I’ll lose the road.’11.1.2      Discontinuity of time
    Where one or both clauses are marked by adverbs of time, a disjunction of events is
implied, even where the pronominal reference for both events is identical. Again, there
are no explicit coordinators marking such predications; the relationship between the two
events must be inferred:

    Where there is discontinuity of time (as in §11.1.2), there can also be an accompanying
discontinuity in TAM marking between the two verbs of the construction. The semantic
inference to be drawn in such cases is not different from the inferences we saw in (363)
and (364). In the following examples, the first verb is marked for realis or past, and the
second verb for irrealis:                                            135

by time adverbials – such often imply “condition” and will be dealt with next.","[134, 135, 136]"
"5.1.1.1.    Possessive prefixes
    In first and second persons singular, the same pronominal roots (tsi- and ni-) can
occur as pronominal prefixes on nouns, without the genitive. Where they do, they are
possessive prefixes, and differ from the possessive pronouns shown in (90) in much the
same way that ‘mine’ differs from ‘my’ in English. The “alienable–inalienable”
distinction found in some languages appears to be irrelevant for Kusunda. Following
are examples:
    (91)    a. tsi-gimi
               1SPOSS-money                ‘my money’
            b. ni-gimi
                 2SPOSS-money              ‘your money’                                                45
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    In first and second persons plural, the possessive root cannot occur as a possessive
prefix attached directly to nouns, but must be accompanied by the genitive. This is true
also for third person gina, as in:
    (92)    a. *tig-gimi
            b. tig-i       gimi
                1PPOSS-GEN money          ‘our money’
    (93)    a. *gina-gimi
            b. gina-yi gimi
               he-GEN money               ‘his money’
    First or second person singular possession can be marked by either form – the
prefixal form or the genitive marked form – though there are likely pragmatic differences
between the two. The following examples show them in free variation:
    (94)    a. tsi-gimi ~ tsi-yi gimi         ‘my money’
            b. ni-gimi ~ ni-yi gimi           ‘your money’
    The genitive occurs also on question words, as in:
    (95)        n˙ti-ye      gimi
                who-GEN      money            ‘whose money?’5.1.1.2.   Lexicalized third person possession
    There are several lexical items in the language in which an initial g- is very likely the
vestige of an old third person possessive prefix. Typically, such words come from the
domain of body parts (and may be restricted to a general “parts” domain). Thus, for
example, the default word for ‘stomach’ is gim˙t and the second person possessed
form, ‘your stomach,’ is ni-gim˙t. From this we might expect tsi-gim˙t for ‘my stomach,’
which, indeed is possible, but the preferred form is ts-im˙t.
    (96)    a. gim˙t            ‘stomach’
            b. ni-gim˙t         ‘your stomach’
            c. ts-im˙t          ‘my stomach’
    Interestingly, in Reinhard’s 1976 list, ‘stomach’ is listed as imat, without a prefix.
In contrast, ‘knee’ in Reinhard’s list is t-uputu with a prefix (likely meaning ‘my
knee’), while we have elicited upto.
    The word for ‘wind’ is qai, while the word for ‘breath’ is either ata qai ‘mouth
wind,’ or ge-qai ‘its wind.’
    (97)    a. qai                      ‘wind’
            b. ata qai                  ‘breath’ (lit. ‘mouth wind’)
            c. ge-qai, [gya-qai]        ‘breath’ (lit. ‘its wind’)
    A word that commonly occurs in combination with other words to mean something
like ‘fluid’ or ‘juice,’ is very likely the etymon for ‘water’ with a lexicalized third
person prefix, as in the following:
    (98)    a. ta≥                    ‘water’
            b. gida≥                  ‘sap’ (lit. ‘its water’)
            c. ata gida≥              ‘saliva’ (lit. ‘mouth water’)                                             46

    Other candidates for a lexicalized third person prefix are the following:

             b.   gidza≥                 ‘body’

   First and second person pronouns have an oblique form that occurs with the accusative,
and third person has a slightly reduced form. Thus, taken together with the genitive
form, Kusunda has two “oblique” modifications of the pronoun, one for the genitive
and another for the accusative, as summarized in Table 2:

   The interrogative pronouns of Kusunda correspond to the so-called WH-words of
English and include the following seven:
    (100)      a.    n˙ti                  ‘who, what’
               b.    n˙n                   ‘what, why’
               c.    n˙tßn                 ‘what, why’
               d.    hampe                 ‘where’
               e.    ˙sa                   ‘how’
               f.    ˙si                   ‘how much’
               g.    ˙saÚ i                ‘when’
    The semantic domain of some of these interrogatives is not yet clear. ‘What,’ for
example, can be expressed by n˙ti, n˙n, or n˙tßn, all obviously related forms, but it is not
clear what their semantic differences are.1 9 Used with an animate demonstrative, n˙ti is    17
        The basic form for this word is mihaq ~ mehaq, and it is not clear to us what the function of
the prefix ge- might be.
        B. K. Rana (2002) claims similarity between this word and the Kham word ge-pa≥ ‘our
    18language.’ Granted, p˙n and pa≥ bear some similarity, the initial element in Kham is a first person
plural prefix, while in Kusunda it is a third person singular.","[45, 46, 47]"
"5.5.5.1.    Intransitive imperative
    The regular marker for the imperative in intransitive verbs is the suffix -to, varying                                             75
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––with -do. In fact, the suffix occurs also with verbs that one would expect to be transitive.
Following are examples of -to (-do) on intransitive verbs:
   (194)        a. ip-to                      ‘Sleep!’
                b. o -do                      ‘Die!’
                c. bem-to                     ‘Fall!’
                d. hyoq-to                    ‘Hide!’
                e. b˙l-to                     ‘Descend / Come down!’
                f. limi-to                    ‘Dance!’
                g. dzoq-to                    ‘Swim / Get wet!’
                h. tul-to                     ‘Dress (yourself)!’
                i. sip-to                     ‘Enter!’
                j. pæu-to                     ‘Jump!’
                k. yu≥-to                     ‘Lie down!’
                l. lib~u-to                   ‘Play!’
                m. nu≥-to                     ‘Get up!’
                n. dæu≥-to                    ‘Stand!’
                o. byo≥-to                    ‘Squat!’
                p. dzæ˙m-to                   ‘Weep!’
                q. pæep-to                    ‘Drop!’
                r. hu.u-do                    ‘Fly!’   • Nasal allomorph -no. Where the verb root ends in a uvular nasal consonant, the
form of the imperative is -no, as in the following:
   (195)        a. h~aˆ -no                   ‘Sit!’
                b. g~aˆ -no                   ‘Look!’
    Some verbs which seem to be transitive in force also take the intransitive imperative
marker (as in (195b) ‘look’). Another such verb is ‘to climb, mount,’ as in soq-to
‘Climb!’ In the case frame of this verb, however, the thing climbed is marked for
locative case, not as an object, as in:
   (196)        tsi-h~ukui-da    yi-g˙       soq-indzi
                1S-child-ACC     tree-ON climb-let
                ‘Let my child climb in the tree.’
    Another two verbs that are transitive in force but intransitive in morphology are the
verbs ‘to beg,’ the imperative of which is – ai-to ‘Beg!’ – and ‘to fight.’ In both cases,
the notional object is marked with the comitative morpheme: ‘to beg with someone’ and
‘to fight with someone.’ Apparently, verbs without a fully affected object are both
semantically and morphologically “less than transitive” (Hopper & Thompson 1980).
    Other verbs which might be expected to take transitive morphology are the verbs ‘to
eat’ and ‘to wait.’ Their imperatives, however, are formed by -to: am-to2 8 ‘Eat!’ and
¯aq-to ‘Wait!’ It may be that these two verbs are ambitransitive, though we lack the data
to make that claim. More difficult verbs to “explain” are kham-to ‘Bite!’ and o)-to
‘Set it aside!’   28
        The imperative of ‘eat’ is also am, a bare root without affixation.","[75, 76]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––5.6.1.      Adverbs of manner
   Two adverbs of manner that are generic are based on ‘this’ and ‘that’ and combine
with the ‘make’ verb root to form pro-forms – ‘in this manner,’ and ‘in that manner’:
    (216)      a. ai ˙di           ‘doing like this’
               b. gin ˙di          ‘doing like that’
    Other adverbs of manner have to do with the relative speed in which an event occurs,
as in the following:
    (217)      a. m˙st˙m˙          ‘slowly’
               b. m˙la≥            ‘tardily’
               c. siba             ‘fast, quickly’
    Others adverbs refer to the associative aspect of the referents performing the action:
    (218)      a. myaqa            ‘alone’
               b. qa tse           ‘together’
     Still others adverbs of manner answer questions about an event’s level of certainty
or necessity, and if the event did not occur, about the margin of possibility by which it
failed to occur, as in:
    (219)      a. REALIS:
                  k˙pæera          ‘again’
               b. IRREALIS:
                  hunko            ‘almost’5.6.2.      Adverbs of time
   Adverbs of time are broader in scope that manner adverbs, and characterize entire
events, as in: Yesterday, Prem Bahadur went to the forest. In the following examples,
we list them in broad semantic domains, though it must be pointed out that the different
domains have no significance or relevance in grammatical terms:

    Adverbs of location specify the physical location of an event or of its participants, as
in: Kamala sat across from me. Locative suffixes also specify location or direction, as
in ‘in the tree’ or ‘to the house’ and were treated in §5.2.2.3. Those listed here are
locative postpositions. Locative postpositions were treated more generally in §5.3 as a
class of nouns – “relator nouns” – and will not be repeated here.
    We will add here two other adverbs – adverbs of relative distance – that are somewhat
different from physical location:
    (224)      a. h~utu                ‘far’
               b. ist˙                 ‘near’5.6.4.      Adverbs of quantity

6.        Basic clause types
    Basic clause types in Kusunda are 1) verbless equative constructions, 2) existential
and locative copular constructions, and 3) intransitive, transitive, and bitransitive construc-

verbs, but in this section we will attempt to summarize and bring together all the salient
features that serve to define them.","[82, 83, 84, 85]"

                  (not ‘I’ll bring it for you.’)10.2.3.2 A lexical benefactive
    Recall from §6.1.4 that many transitive verbs are modelled after the verb ‘to do,
make,’ as in: abi a-t-ßn (carry do-1-REAL) ‘I carry it.’ Some of the same verbs (but
apparently not all of them) can substitute the verb ‘to give’ in place of ‘to do.’ Where
this occurs, we get a benefactive reading, as in:
    (356)      a. ni-bæari abi        e-d-u
                  2S-load     carry give-1-IRR:SG

                  ‘Beat it (for me).’10.2.4      The “teach” converbal
     The “teach” converbal employs the overlapping converbal marker -de, followed by
a finite form of the verb ‘to show.’ The following examples show that the verb ‘show’
is not in a sequential relationship with the preceding verb, but an overlapping relationship.
It implies teaching by example, ‘showing how’:
    (357)      a. tsi n˙n-da        wi      a-de       unda-d-u
                  I you-ACC house make-CNV show-1-IRR:SG
                  ‘I’ll show you how to build a house.’
                  (not: ‘I’ll build a house and show you.’)
               b. nu     t˙n-da     ip˙n sula-de     unda-n-u
                  you me-ACC corn break-CNV show-2-IRR:SG
                  ‘You’ll show me how to harvest corn.’
                  (not: ‘You’ll break corn and show me.’)
               b. gina t˙n-da     amba hul˙-de      unda-i

                  ‘He showed me how to cook meat.’
                  (not: ‘He cooked meat and showed me.’)10.2.5      Causative converbal – ‘send’
   We saw the periphrastic causative ‘send’ earlier in §9.2.2, but we are now in a
position to discuss it more fully. The ‘send’ causative contrasts with the ‘make’                                            132

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––causative in at least two ways. First of all, the ‘make’ causative is an implicative
causative, i.e. it implies that the embedded event also occurred. With the ‘send’ causative,
such an implication seems to be weaker (though we are not yet sure). Secondly, the
‘send’ causative employs the “overlapping converb” as part of its structure. (The
‘make’ causative did not.)
    The overlapping converb carries with it the implication that the two verbs in the
clause chain are at least partially continuous, both temporally and thematically. This
contrasts with a sequential interpretation, in which the initial verb-event occurs first and
the final verb-event later. These clauses are bitransitive with a hierarchical structure.
The accusative marked object is an object of the higher verb and the embedded object is
unmarked. Following are examples:
    (358)     a. tsi n˙n-da        wi      a-de       t˙mb˙-d-u
                 I     you-ACC house make-CNV send-1-IRR:SG
                 ‘I’ll make/have you build a house.’
                 (not: ‘I’ll make a house and send you.)
              b. nu gin-da          wi      a-de        t˙mb˙-n-i
                 you him-ACC house make-CNV send-2-PAST
                 ‘You made/had him build a house.’
                 (not: ‘You built a house and sent him.’)
    Part of the force of the ‘send’ causative is captured in the English idiomatic expression
(from Shakespeare) She sent him packing, which means something like, ‘She made him
leave.’
                                            133
11. Combinations of finite clauses
In §10 we looked at clause chains of two types – 1) those that code events which occur
in temporal sequence, and 2) those that code events in which there is some kind of
temporal or semantic overlap. There is a formal structural difference – the former are
“co-ranking” in structure, all verbs being finite (and hence equal in rank, Longacre
1985), and the latter are “co-subordinate,” making a distinction between medial verbs
(non-finite) and final verbs (finite).
    In this chapter we will look further at co-ranking structures – those clause combinations
in which both verbs are finite. These are clauses of coordination, of condition, of
adversity and concession. But because there are no explicit clause connectors, like
‘and’ or ‘but,’ in Kusunda, the semantic relationship between any two co-ranking
clauses is a matter of inference. This is not to say that the inferences are not dependent
on certain grammatical and pragmatic factors; they are. Two very broad factors that are
relevant to our study are 1) the level of continuity between clauses, and 2) the particular
TAM marking employed. Continuity between clauses implies conjunction, and disconti-
nuity implies disjunction. It also turns out that irrealis marking on the final clause of a
two-clause construction almost always implies a conditional construction.","[131, 132, 133, 134]"
"9.3       Complements
     There are numerous verbs which are capable of supporting sentential complements
as an object (or destination) argument – ‘go/come for the purpose of,’ ‘want,’ ‘be able
to,’ ‘allow,’ ‘finish,’ ‘see/hear that,’ ‘think that,’ and ‘know how to.’9.3.1         Purposive
    The “purposive” clause is a complement to matrix verbs ‘go/come,’ or ‘send/bring.’
We have already seen numerous examples of this clause type when we illustrated the
morphology of -da in §8.2. The purposive can also be marked by “neutral” morphology
(see §8.1). Here we reiterate some of the examples used elsewhere:
      (329)      a. WITH GO:
                    tsya qon-da            t -a -an
                    tea drink-PURP 1-go-IRR:SG
                    ‘I will go to drink tea.’
                 b. WITH COME:
                    nu n-˙m-n-a           n-ug-un
                    you 2-eat-2-PURP      2-come-REAL
                    ‘You came to eat.’
                 c. WITH SEND:
                    gin-da kam ˙n-da         t˙mb˙-d-i
                    he-ACC work do-PURP send-1-PAST
                    ‘I sent him to do work.’9.3.2         Desiderative
    The desiderative embeds complements to the matrix verb ‘to want.’ Literally, when
used with non-sentential arguments, the Kusunda verb means ‘to search for.’ As with
the purposive, complements of the desiderative can be marked “neutral” or with the
suffix -da:
      (330)      a. gina wi        ˙g-˙n         ~oˆ la-g-˙n
                    he   house make-REAL want-3-REAL
                    ‘He wants to build a house.’                                           120
                                       Himalayan Linguistics: Archive No. 3
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––               b. tsi wi        ˙n-da        ~oˆ la-d-ßn
                  I    house make-PURP want-1-REAL
                  ‘I want to build a house.’
               c. tsi gin-da      p˙rm˙-da     ~oˆ la-d-i
                  I    him-ACC meet-PURP want-1-PAST
                  ‘I want/wanted to meet him.’
   As in many other languages of the region, with ‘want’ the subject of matrix and
embedded clauses must be the same. Thus, it is not possible with this structure to say ‘I
want him to go’ – only ‘I want to go’ or ‘He wants to go.’9.3.3      Abilitive
    The verb ‘to be able’ is homophonous with the intransitive verb ‘to hide’; indeed, by
strange circumstances, it may be the same verb. The abilitive conjugates as an intransitive
verb. Syntactically, though, the verb allows a sentential complement marked either with
-da or as neutral, as in the following:
   (331)       a. tsi wi       ˙n-da            hyoq-tsi-n
                  I house make-PURP             able-1-REAL
                  ‘I can build houses.’
               b. t-˙m-˙n        hyoq-wa
                  1-eat-REAL     able-IRR:NEG
                  ‘I can’t eat.’
               c. tsi amba pad˙-n           hyoq-tsi-n
                  I meat hunt-REAL          able-1-REAL
                  ‘I can hunt animals.’   • Opportunitive. A second “abilitive” construction contrasts with the one above in
§9.3.3. The former implies physical ability, whereas this one implies “finding
opportunity.” It uses the matrix verb ‘to find’:
   (332)       a. t -a -an          d~aba-d-aÚ i
                  1-go-SUBORD       find-1-NEG:REAL
                  ‘I wasn’t able to go.’
               b. t-˙m-˙n       d~aba-d-aÚ i
                  1-eat-REAL find-1-NEG:REAL
                  ‘I wasn’t able to eat.’
    Notice that in (332a) that the mutating verb ‘go’ is marked by the mutated form of
‘go,’ indicating that it is subordinate. (See §8.4.)9.3.4      Permissive
   The permissive construction employs the matrix verb ‘to give.’ As in the other
complements we have seen, the embedded verb is marked by -da or as neutral:
   (333)       a. gina t˙n-da     wi      ˙n-da     eg-i
                  he me-ACC house make-PURP give-3-PAST
                  ‘He allowed me to build a house.’                                           121

                 ‘He didn’t used to let me eat, now he lets me eat.’
    As we saw earlier in §8.4, and also with the implicative causative in §9.2.1, this
construction casts embedded mutating verbs in the “marked” form (elsewhere, the
“irrealis”).
   (334)      a. t˙n-da    t -a -an     e-g-i
                 me-ACC 1-go-SUBORD give-3-PAST

                 me-ACC 1-go-SUBORD give-3-PAST:NEG
                 ‘He didn’t allow me to go.’9.3.5      Preventative
    The preventative construction employs the causative of the verb ‘to stand,’ and
means ‘to stop someone doing something.’ Two separate events are coded, and both
are fully finite. Following are examples:
   (335)      a. g-˙m-˙n       dæoˆ -a-d-i
                 3-eat-REAL stand-CAUS-1-PAST
                 ‘I stopped him eating.’
              b. g-u-ya,        dæo ˆ-a-yin
                 3-come-OPT,    stand-CAUS-PROH
                 ‘Let him come, don’t stop him.’9.3.6      Completive
    The completive matrix verb is the transitive verb ‘to finish.’ As far as we know, only
this complement structure requires both verbs (the matrix verb and the embedded verb)
to be coded in the same TAM. We repeat here example (177):
   (336)      a. wi       a-t-ßn          tumb˙-d-ßn
                 house make-1-REAL finish-1-REAL
                 ‘I finished building the house.’
              b. wi       a-d-i          tumb˙-d-i
                 house make-1-PAST finish-1-PAST
                 ‘I finished building the house.’
              c. *wi    a-t-ßn      tumb˙-d-i
                 *house make-1-REAL finish-1-PAST9.3.7      See and hear
    The verbs ‘see’ and ‘hear’ regularly support complements in which the embedded
clause is a separate, autonomous event from the matrix verb event. Not surprisingly,
both verbs are marked as fully finite, each of them expressing person–number and TAM
specifications for the immediate clause only. Following are examples:
                                          122

                 ‘My friend saw me building a house.’
    In (337a) the main clause event is ‘I saw,’ while the embedded event is ‘He builds a
house.’ Likewise, in (337b) the main clause event is ‘He saw,’ while the embedded
event is ‘I build a house.’ The events are entirely autonomous. The same holds for the
verb ‘hear,’ as in the following:
   (338)      a. tsi wa     t-ug-un      m˙b˙-g-i
                 I home 1-come-REAL hear-3-PAST

                 cry.out-3-PAST hear-1-PAST
                 ‘I heard him cry out.’9.3.8      Think
    The verb ‘think’ in Kusunda also means ‘to remember,’ as in tsi n˙n-da imba-d-i (I
you-ACC think-1-PAST) ‘I remembered you.’ We have only one example of the verb
with a sentential complement:
   (339)      tsi da≥        t -a -an     imba-d-i
              I     Dang 1-go-SUBORD think-1-PAST
              I think I will go to Dang.’
    Notice that here, too, like we saw in (329) and (334), the embedded “mutating” verb
‘go’ takes the marked case.","[120, 121, 122, 123]"
"    • Benefactive light verb. The verb ‘give’ is the prototypical bitranstive verb and
forms the basis for some benefactive constructions in Class II verbs. In much the same
way that ‘do’ functions as a transitive marker in Class II verbs, so too ‘give’ functions
as a bitransitive marker for some of the same verbs. The paradigm is identical to the
“causative” paradigm given in (244), with the exception that the root is e-, not a-. Most
Class II verb, however, cannot participate in this construction, and we do not yet know
what the constraints are. Following are examples (see also §10.2.3.2. example (356):

                  ‘I’ll carry your corn for you.’
    There are at least two verbs in the language whose transitive morphology is based on
the verb ‘to give’ (in much the same way that Class II transitive verb conjugations are
based on the verb ‘do’). This may be because both verbs imply a dative goal – ‘write to
someone’ and ‘laugh at someone,’ as in the following:
      (250)    a. tsi haq lekæ e-d-i
                  I letter write give-1-PAST
                  ‘I wrote a letter.’

                  we laugh give-1-PL:IRR
                  ‘We will laugh (at him).’6.2       Intransitive–transitive clauses
    Morphologically, there are few differences between transitive and intransitive verb
types. Both are indexed for a single referent – the subject referent. There is no object
marking. The major morphological differences for verbs, then, lie in the distinction
between Class I and Class II – those with prefixed or suffixed person marking, respectively.
We have already seen some of those differences in §5.5.1.1 and §5.5.1.2. The differences
have implications for number marking as well (see §5.5.2). For Class I there are both
transitive and intransitive verbs, and for Class II there are both transitive and intransitive
verbs.
    However, though there are no morphological differences between transitive and
intransitive Class I verbs, there are minor differences between transitive and intransitive
Class II verbs. Thus, in terms of morphological differences, the Class I–Class II
distinction is primary, and the transitive–intransitive distinction is secondary. The differ-
ences between Class II transitive and Class II intransitive verbs lie in person marking
patterns, as shown in Figure 2:

    In the most basic pattern, Class II intransitive verbs are bereft of person marking –
the suffix -ßn shown in Figure 1 is a realis marker; there is no person marker. The
distinction between persons lies only in the free pronoun:
   (251)       a. FIRST PERSON:                 b. SECOND PERSON:
                  tsi sip-ßn                       nu sip-ßn
                  I    enter-REAL                  you enter-REAL
                  ‘I entered.’                     ‘You entered.’
   (252)       a. FIRST PERSON:                 b. SECOND PERSON:
                  tsi b˙l-ßn                       nu b˙l-ßn
                  I    descend-REAL                you descend-REAL
                  ‘I descended.’                   ‘You descended.’6.2.2      Intransitive suffixing pattern 2
    In what was probably a later, secondary development, person marking distinctions
developed in these ambiguous cases, analagous to the distinctions found elsewhere in
the grammar. As we have already seen in example (146), a pronominal marker, very
nearly a copy of the free pronoun, is suffixed to the root, immediately before the realis
marker, as in:
   (253)       a. FIRST PERSON:
                  tsi sip-tsi-n
                  I enter-1-REAL
                  ‘I entered.’
               b. SECOND PERSON:
                  nu sip-ni-n
                  you enter-2-REAL
                  ‘You entered.’                                               94

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––6.2.3         Suffixing pattern 3
    In yet another development, a full copy of the free pronoun is tacked on to the end of
the verb complex, following the realis marker, as in:
      (254)      a. FIRST PERSON:
                    tsi sip-ßn-tsi
                    I enter-REAL-1
                    ‘I entered.’
                 b. SECOND PERSON:
                    nu sip-ßn-nu
                    you enter-REAL-2
                    ‘You entered.’    • Pattern 3 in transitive verbs. The suffixing pattern described in §6.2.3 is also
available to Class II transitive verbs, as in the following:
      (255)      a. TRANSITIVE FIRST PERSON:
                    tsi hul˙-d-ßn-tsi
                    I cook-1-REAL-1
                    ‘I cooked it.’
                 b. TRANSITIVE SECOND PERSON:
                    nu hul˙-n-ßn-nu
                    you cook-2-REAL-2
                    ‘You cooked it.’
     The triple -n-ßn-n in (255b), though morphologically accurate, is a bit of phonological
fiction. Except in very carefully articulated speech, hul˙-d-ßn and hul˙-n-ßn (the basic
forms) are pronounced identically – as hul˙-d-ßn – giving rise to the need for disambiguation.
This is true of all second person forms in Class II transitive verbs: pumba-n-ßn ‘You hit
him’; d~aba-n-ßn ‘You found it’; m˙b˙-n-ßn ‘You heard it’; unda-n-ßn ‘You showed it,’ etc.
Except in careful speech, all are pronounced with a -d.3 16.2.4         Bitransitive verbs
    The only convincing bitransitive verb in Kusunda is the verb ‘to give,’ with all other
bitransitive notions being benefactive constructions that utilize the verb ‘to give.’
Morphologically, the verb ‘give’ is identical to Class II transitive verbs (see Figure 1),
the only exception being the verb root itself.","[92, 93, 94, 95]"
"9.1       Adnominals and relative clauses
    Kusunda has no relative pronouns. So-called “relative clauses” are composed of a
finite verb in adnominal function which modifies the following head noun, as in: ‘the
I-kicked-it ball’ in place of ‘the ball that I kicked.’ In other languages of the region,
both IA and TB, adnominals formed from verbs are typically nominalized structures.
Kusunda is exceptional in this respect and does not fit the areal typology. (Santali also,
apparently, has fully finite verbs used in modification (see Masica 1976:121).)9.1.1         Finite adnominals formed from verbs
    The adnominal modifier in Kusunda utilizes at least two of the structures we saw in
§8 – they can be cast as “neutral,” or they can be fully finite. Neither appears to be a
nominalization (although the “neutral” form may, in fact, turn out to be a nominalization).
Though such adnominals are formed from verbs and are modifying in function, they
have no morphological form that can be said to be different from an ordinary finite verb
(and hence not strictly speaking ‘participles’) – they are fully inflected for person, and
can be TAM-marked either as realis or past tense. Following are examples of finite
verbs in past tense functioning as modifiers within relative clauses:
      (309)      a. hab˙-g-i       amba
                    roast-3-PAST meat
                    ‘meat that he roasted’
                 b. na tsi d~aba-d-i        gimi,    n˙n-da       e-d-u-wa
                    this I find-1-PAST money, you-ACC give-1-IRR-NEG
                    ‘This is money that I found, I will not give it to you.’
      Realis marked adnominals are similar in structure:
      (310)      a. tsi t-˙m-˙n       kæaidzi
                    I 1-eat-REAL food
                    ‘food that I ate’
                 b. tsi e-d-ßn       gimi    hampe hur˙-n-i
                    I give-1-REAL money where throw-2-PAST
                    ‘Where did you throw the money I gave you?’
    We have no examples of irrealis marked adnominals (though they may exist –
further research needs to be done here). Relative clauses, of course, are the locus of
presupposed propositions, and it would not be surprising to find a preponderance of
“factitive” verb forms coding them, i.e. those denoting established fact.",[113]

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––8.1.2       In Class II transitive verbs
   Class II transitive verbs, too, for the most part, can occur in a neutral form. This is
especially true if the verb root ends in a consonant, as in:
    (289)      a. tok kæaidzi dza -˙n ts-i-da-n
                  we food      buy-NEUT 1-go-PL-REAL
                  ‘We went to buy food.’
               b. tsi amba hab-˙n         t-ug-un
                  I meat roast-NEUT 1-come-REAL
                  ‘I came to roast meat.’
               c. amba pad-˙n          ts-i-d˙-i
                  meat hunt-NEUT 1-go-PL-HORT
                  ‘Let’s go hunting (for animals).’
    In these Class II transitive verbs, it is difficult to know if the so-called neutral forms
are only contracted third person realis forms – ˙-g-˙n (do-3-REAL) > -˙n. Many third
person realis forms, pronounced simply as -˙n by Kamala, are pronounced -˙g˙n by
Gyani Maiya. The third person -g tends to surface more readily in open syllable roots:
    (290)      kæaidzi ai-g-˙n        t-ug-un
               food     beg-3-REAL 1-come-REAL
               ‘I came to beg for food.’
    Forms like the one in (290) are problematic in that they use a third person form in
the complement (‘to beg’), a form technically incompatible with first person in the
matrix verb (‘I came’). Thus, although forms like ai-g-˙n, too, are neutral or generic in
function, we will reserve the label “neutral” to those forms that are without third person
marking (as in (289)); especially where the form is incompatible with third person. (For
less finite forms for some of these verbs see §8.2.2.)8.1.3       In Class I verbs
    Class I verbs are the least amenable to non-finite conjugation for the simple reason
that such verbs normally include a prefixed person marker. In such cases, a third person
form is used (somewhat analogous to the form in (290) in which third person seems to
be understood as generic, as in:
    (291)      g-˙m-˙n       kæaidzi
               3-eat-REAL food
               ‘eaten food’ / ‘food eaten by (someone)’8.1.4       Bare roots (concatenative structures)
    There are a few verbs for which only the bare root occurs in neutral constructions,
without the final -n, in a concatenative structure. This possibility is apparently lexically
determined and is not available for all verbs:
    (292)      a. ta≥    kola t-ug-un
                  water draw 1-come-REAL
                  ‘I came to draw water.’

                    cook 1-eat-IRR:SG
                    ‘I’ll cook and eat.’
   In a sense, all Class II transitives modelled after the verb ‘to do’ are a special case of
bare-root neutral verbs (i.e. “non-inflecting verbs”) – here followed by a conjugated
form of the verb ‘to make, to do.’ Following is an example of a typical Class II verb:
      (293)      qaÚi  u-g-i         ip˙n suml˙        ˙-g˙-n-dzi
                 wind come-3-PAST corn break           do-3-REAL-TAM (?)
                 ‘Wind comes and breaks the corn.’8.2       Embedded structures marked by -da
    There are several subordinate clause types – like the purposive, the desiderative, and
non-implicative causatives – that are marked by the suffix -da on the embedded verb.
We will refer to this morpheme as the “purposive” <PURP> morpheme. This -da may
be related to the verb ‘go,’ in which case it would be analogous to purposive constructions
in some TB languages, as in the following Kham example:
      (294)      ≥aÚ zya-na ≥a-hu-ke
                 I    eat-GO 1-come-PFV
                 ‘I came to eat.’
    An alternative is to identify -da with the object marker -da. (Ultimately, of course,
the two may be etymologically related, the object marker itself having derived from ‘go,’
not unusual in the world’s languages.) Interestingly, -da does not occur on relatives, but
is exclusive to complements, and it is in these kinds of contexts that -da ‘go’ begins to
specialize as -da ‘object.’8.2.1         Non-finite forms marked by -da
    Some types of subordinate clauses are marked by the purposive morpheme -da
suffixed to the non-finite, bare root of the embedded verb. The -da suffix, however,
occurs in this “pure” form (we will see modified forms later) on Class I verbs (i.e.
those with potential prefixed person marking), and only after the person marking prefix
has been stripped away (an exception is given in §8.2.2). Thus, the verb ‘to sleep,’ for
example, occurs in its inflected forms with prefixed person marking – ts-ip-ßn ‘I sleep’;
n-ip-ßn ‘You sleep’; g-ip-ßn ‘He sleeps.’ In the non-finite -da structure, however, only
the bare root ip- occurs with -da suffixed:
      (295)      a. tsi ip-da          t-ug-un
                    I sleep-PURP 1-come-REAL
                    ‘I came to sleep.’
                 b. nu ip-da          n-ug-un
                    you sleep-PURP 2-come-REAL
                    ‘You came to sleep.’
                 c. gina ip-da        u-g-i
                    he sleep-PURP come-3-PAST
                    ‘He came to sleep.’
      Likewise with the verb ‘to eat’:

                 ‘If you cook the food, we’ll come to eat it.’
    The important thing to notice in examples (295) and (296) is that the embedded verb
occurs without person agreement prefixes, and that -da occurs invariant, as -da throughout.
Both of these points will contrast with “inflected -da structures” in §8.2.3.
    The bare root forms for these Class I verbs are the same suppletive forms we saw
earlier in §5.5.5.1 (Irregular and suppletive forms). ‘To drink’ is another such verb:
   (297)      tsya qon-da           t -a -an
              tea drink-PURP 1-go-IRR:SG
              ‘I will go to drink tea.’8.2.2      Non-finite Class II verbs marked by -da
    Recall from §8.1.2 that the -˙n “neutral” forms for Class II transitive verbs may, in
fact, be generic third person forms whose full form is -˙g˙n. For at least some verbs of
that class there is also a suppletive form of the verb which combines with -da to form a
non-finite structure. The transitive verb par excellence ‘to do, make’ is one such verb.
Where the inflected forms of the verb are a-d-i ‘I made’; a-n-i ‘You made’; ˙-g-˙n ‘He
made’; the non-finite form is ˙n- as follows:
   (298)      a. tsi wi       ˙n-da         o~ ˆ la-t-ßn
                 I house make-PURP want-1-REAL
                 ‘I want to build a house.’

                 work do-PURP send-1-PAST
                 ‘I sent him to do work.’
     Likewise, there is also a less finite structure for the verb ‘to beg’ than the one
illustrated in example (290) of §8.1.2. It is as follows:
   (299)      ai-da       t-ug-un
              beg-PURP 1-come-REAL
              ‘I came to beg.’8.2.3      Inflected forms marked by -da
    The forms in this section will contrast with those described in §8.2.1. Furthermore,
the structures described in this section are available to both Class I and Class II verbs.","[106, 107, 108, 109]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––7.1.2       Morphological causative -da
    Most intransitive verbs can be made transitive by adding the morphological causative
suffix -da. Where such verbs belong inherently to Class I, i.e. having prefixed person
marking, after derivation they become Class II verbs – i.e. having suffixed person
marking. Thus, in the following examples, the (a) sentences are inherently Class I verbs
and their transitive (b) counterparts are Class II. Prefixed person marking is lost:

                  sleep-CAUS-1-PAST           ‘I put him to sleep.’

                  1-die-REAL                  ‘I died.’
               b. TRANSITIVE
                  o -da-d-i
                  die-CAUS-1-PAST             ‘I killed him.’
    Note that the causative of ‘die,’ i.e. the verb ‘kill’ illustrated in (261b) is very often
pronounced ora- and is an example of a verb developing what may someday become a
suppletive pair whose developmental pathway is opaque – -o) ‘die’ versus ora- ‘kill.’
    For Class II intransitive verbs there is no shift from prefixing to suffixing under
causativization – they begin with suffixed person marking. Such verbs can be made
transitive either by the morphological causative -a or by the morphological causative -da.
The choice of one over the other does not seem to be based on phonological factors or
the syllable type of the root. The verbs ‘sleep’ and ‘die’ both end in consonants and
the causative is formed by -da. But so also do ‘fall’ and ‘wear’ end in consonants, but
the causative is formed by -a (though -da is also possible with no apparent difference in
meaning, though, of course, there may be a difference in “force” for “directness” of
causation). ‘Scorch’ and ‘swell’ end in vowels, but both form the causative by -da.
There is a great deal of variation between the two forms. Following are verbs which can
take either form:

                 insert-CAUS-1-REAL            ‘I inserted (something).’
    Some verbs, in addition to a causative morpheme, manifest some phonological change
in the root morpheme itself. The pair ‘to survive’ versus ‘to rescue’ is one such pair
(from ˙igi- to ˙gi-):
      (264)   a. ˙igi-d-ßn
                 live-1-REAL                   ‘I survived.’

                 live-CAUS-1-REAL              ‘I rescued (him).’
    Some intransitives when causativized yield unexpected meanings. Two examples are
the verbs ‘to laugh’ and ‘to say.’ Causativized by the morphological causative they do
not mean ‘make laugh’ or ‘make say,’ but rather ‘laugh at’ and ‘say to.’ (Similar
semantic shifts occur in Nepali, suggesting the possibility of contact induced meanings.)
      (265)   a. gin-da nikæ-e-d-i
                 he-ACC laugh-CAUS-1-PAST
                 ‘I laughed at him.’

                 ‘No matter what I say to him, he cries.’
     It should also be noted that morphological causativization in Kusunda works even
on intransitive “process” verbs which would normally require a periphrastic causative
in English – verbs like ‘rot.’ The implication is that the subject is ultimately responsible
for the eventuality, even if only by neglect or inadvertence. Such causatives are typologically
common in the area, in both TB and IA languages:
      (266)   tsi yi-da         qau-da-d-i
              I wood-ACC rot-CAUS-1-PAST
              ‘I rotted the wood.’7.2      Anti-causative
    The anti-causative is a detransitivizing derivation on inherently transitive verbs yielding
intransitive and middle senses. In such verbs the “middle” or “anti-causative” <AC> is
marked by the suffix -q. The ‘break’ verbs are among them, as in the following sets of
contrastive pairs:

                 ‘This string is like it will break.’7.2.1      Anti-causative -q versus lexical -q
    Somewhat problematic are intransitive verb roots in which a final -q is part of the
underived lexical representation. On the surface, such verb roots look like derived
middles, but, in fact, there are no corresponding transitives without the -q. In such cases,
-q is not a derivational marker per se. Rather, the marker is semantically motivated,
occurring on verbs whose inherent status is middle. We will not separate the -q in these
cases, but treat it as part of the underlying root. (If we do find occasion to dissect such
forms, we will mark them as “middle marked” <MM>, recognizing that we are not
dealing with a derivation.) Under causativization, the middle marking remains (often
becoming -)), followed by the morphological causative -a, as in the following:
   (270)      a. wi      gyaq-ßn
                 house collapse-REAL

                  ‘I spilled the water.’
    It is important to notice the contrast between verbs whose underlying root ends in -q
and verbs whose underlying root is an open syllable. In the former case, -q (or -))
occurs in both transitive and intransitive forms, whereas in the latter case -q occurs only
in the intransitive. Thus, in (272) -q is lexical and the transitive form is derived, and in
(273) -q is derivational and the intransitive form is derived:

    Another verb with lexical -q in the intransitive member is soq- ‘climb,’ as in:

                  ‘I treed him.’7.2.2       Anti-causative -t
     More difficult to interpret are intransitive verb roots which end in -t. Recall that in
many transitive verb conjugations (like a-t-ßn ‘I made’), -t followed by syllabic -ßn signifies
first person followed by realis. There are numerous intransitive verbs, however, in which
a stem final -t followed by syllabic -ßn does not indicate first person:
    (275)      a. dimi    n~odze gwi-t-ßn
                  smoke above gather-<T>-REAL
                  ‘Smoke (soot) gathered above.’

                  jug-LOC      water fill-<T>-REAL
                  ‘Water filled in the jug.’
    We have glossed -t in (275a–b) with a tentative <T>. The question is, “Is -t part of
the lexical root or is it a grammatical morpheme?” We know already that -t here is not
                                             101
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Transitivity alternations
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––first person. Following the same line of reasoning we used above, we need to compare
these forms with their causativized counterparts:
    (276)     a. tsi d˙idzi       gwi-˙-d-i
                 I firewood gather-CAUS-1-PAST
                 ‘I gathered firewood.’
              b. gag˙ri-ga ta≥           pæir-a-t-ßn
                 jug-LOC       water fill-CAUS-1-REAL
                 ‘I filled water in the jug.’
     The stem final -t does not occur in the causativized version (*gwi-t-a-t-ßn) and we are
left to conclude that -t is an anti-causative morpheme analogous to the -q we saw earlier.
It turns out, in fact, that we have no verbs in our corpus with root final -t. Where -t
occurs it is always anti-causative <AC>.
     In §5.5.1.2 (subsection intransitive patterns) we saw that Class II intransitive verbs
have the option of including a person marker immediately after the root-final consonant:
    (277)     a. sip-ts-in
                 enter-1-REAL             ‘I entered.’
              b. b˙l-n-in
                 descend-2-REAL           ‘You descended.’
              c. pæep-ts-in
                 fall-1-REAL              ‘I fell.’
              d. hyoq-n-in
                 hide-2-REAL              ‘You hid.’
    Significantly, where the same optional person marking is employed in intransitive
verbs with anti-causative -t, the -t occurs after person marking, separating the -t from the
verb root. This strengthens our hypothesis that -t is not part of the intransitive root:
    (278)     a. nok       gwi-ni-t-n-a-n
                 you[pl] gather-2-AC-2-PL-REAL
                 ‘You all gathered.’
              b. hampe t -a -an kæai-tsi-t-ßn
                 where   1-go-IRR fear-1-AC-REAL
                 ‘Wherever I go I get scared.’
              c. un-da      ts-˙g-˙n      miÚ-tsi-t-ßn
                 road-LOC 1-go-REAL lost-1-AC-REAL
                 ‘Going along the road I got lost.’
    We have numerous other examples, too, of “floating” -t in our data base, but we
will not list them all here.
    It would, of course, be satisfying to our claims if anti-causative -q also floated to the
right of person markers, thus demonstrating that it too is an element divisible from the
verb root. In fact we have no data in our corpus to prove this. (Nor do we have
anything to disprove it.) We have examples of person marking only on verbs in which
-q is part of the root, and as our claims would predict, -q remains attached to the root, as
in: borloq-tsi-n ‘I got boiled,’ and gyaq-tsi-n ‘I collapsed.’

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––7.2.3       Passive
    There is no canonical passive in Kusunda (of the English sort) in which the former
object is promoted to subject status. The closest analogue is the detransitivizing, anti-
causative derivation discussed in §7.2 which produces a kind of “middle.” The derivation,
however, appears to be available only to select transitive verbs.
    Another structure which is not well understood applies to transitive and intransitive
verbs alike. On Class II transitive verbs, the “auxiliary” ending ‘to do, make,’ is
replaced by a sequence -in-dzi. -Dzi occurs elsewhere as a “present tense” marker
(also not well understood; see example (265b)). The first affix, -in, resembles the
Nepali passive marker -in, but the resemblance may be accidental. It might be equally
plausible to think of -in as the intransitive (inchoative) version of ‘to do, make’ (see
(244b)). We will label it as <INCHO> for “inchoative.” Following are examples of its
usage (but with no attempted explanation on how the construction works)3 2:
    (279)      a. ACCOMPANIED BY AN ANTI-CAUSATIVE:
                  dza h~oÚ-˙-go             borlo-q-in-dzi
                  fire burn-CAUS-IMP boil-AC-INCHO-TAM (?)
                  ‘Stoke the fire, it (the water) will boil.’
               b. WITHOUT ANTI-CAUSATIVE:
                  qai   u-g-i         ip˙n sola-in-dzi
                  wind come-3-PAST corn break-INCHO-TAM (?)
                  ‘Wind comes and the corn breaks.’
               c. ON AN INTRANSITIVE:
                  n˙n gip˙n ts-o -da-d-ßn            dzæ˙m-in-dzi
                  what word 1-say-CAUS-1-REAL weep-INCHO-TAM (?)
                  ‘Whatever I say to him, he cries.’
    Note that (279a) is made intranstive by virtue of the <AC> marker -q, and (279c) is
intransitive already. (279b) begins as a transitive verb, and appears to be detransitivized
by the inchoative -in.
    We have several examples of intransitive verbs marked by this construction, but are
uncertain about how the meaning differs from ordinary intransitive conjugation without
-in: kæai-in-dzi ‘He is afraid’; meÚ-in-dzi ‘He gets lost’; dæ~u-in-dzi ‘He stands, rises’;
by~o-in-dzi ‘He sits, squats.’7.2.3.1     “Passive” in ambi-transitive verbs
    It is difficult to say unequivocally whether some verbs are inherently transitive or
intransitive. They can be conjugated as transitive or intransitive without mediating
derivational morphology, and the intransitive version is passive-like. The verb ‘to burn,
roast’ is one such verb, as in the following contrastive pair:
    32
       My anonymous reviewer has suggested that because the -in- marker in all the examples listed
occurs on the second clause of a complex sentence, it might indicate that the second clause event is a
consequence of the first clause event. The suggestion warrants looking into.","[97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]"
"5.5.2.2.   Class II person and number marking
    In Class II irrealis mode, the sequences -d-u (157a) and -d-˙k (157b) may appear
superficially to be equivalent to the -du (153a–155a) and -da-k (153b–155b) of Class I
verbs. In fact, however, the Class I and Class II forms are composed of different
morpheme sequences (clearly as a consequence of reanalysis due to person suffixation

                  beat-3-REAL             ‘He/she/they beat (someone).’
    Class II verbs also have a past tense. As is true for irrealis and realis modes, so too
in past tense the suffixes -d, -n, and -g mark first, second, and third person, respectively.
Following is the paradigm:
    (163)     FIRST PERSON
              a. pumba-d-i
                 beat-1-SG:PAST           ‘I beat (someone).’

                 beat-2-SG:PAST           ‘You beat (someone).’
              b. pumba-n-ei

                 beat-3-SG:PAST           ‘He/she beat (someone).’
              b. pumba-(g)-ei
                 beat-3-PL:PAST           ‘They beat (someone).’
    Thus, in Class I verbs, where person markers are prefixed, the sequences -da and -du
are indivisible, single morphemes – -da functions as a plural marker and -du as a
singular irrealis marker. In Class II verbs, -da and -du are forced to coalesce with
suffixed person markers -d, -n, and -g, resulting in a reinterpretation of the data. The
-du of Class I becomes the -d-u, -n-u, and -g-u of Class II; the -da-n of Class I becomes
the -d-˙n, -n-˙n, and -g-˙n of Class II; and, finally, the -da-k of Class I becomes the
-d-˙k, -n-˙k, and -g-˙k of Class II.

    For most verbs in Kusunda there is, what appears to be, a three-way tense distinction
– past, present, and future. By contrast, and central to our understanding of the three-way
distinction, however, Class I verbs have only a two-way distinction. Past and present
time are generally grouped together into a “realis” mode, and its opposite, “irrealis,”
marks future time and possibility. Realis, in some cases, however, can also occur with
future events, especially where certainty is high; such events are “perceptually located in
the real world” (Elliott 2000). Elliott claims that this is the case for a number of
Australian languages; “tense does not necessarily reflect reality status” (Elliott 2000:68).
    Evidence suggests that the realis–irrealis distinction is older and more primary than
the so-called a “past–present–future” distinction. In fact, past tense (see Table 3)
appears to be only an added category; it occupies some of the same semantic space as
realis (see §5.5.4 on Negation) and, more significantly, its absence does not constitute a
“present” tense (indicated by the “strike through” in Table 3). Rather, the absence of
“past” is only realis. The major difference between past and realis is that past has an
unequivocal past–completive reading, while realis is used more frequently in utterances
with a kind of “neutral” or “timeless” sense, as in the verb ‘build’ in the following
sentences:
    (168)      a. pyana        tsi wi          a-t-ßn,          t˙~îna   ts-ip-du

                  ‘Yesterday I built a house, today I will sleep.’                                             66

                 ‘Yesterday I built (finished) a house, today I will sleep.’
    Past–present–future in Kusunda, then, is only the fiction of a three-way division.
The real distinction is past–realis–irrealis. Thus, in Table 3, Class I verbs are those with
a two-way distinction, and Class II verbs add a further distinction for a total of three.

   –––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––  Table 3. TWO-WAY CLASS I DISTINCTION, AND THREE-WAY CLASS II DISTINCTION    From Table 3 we see that both verb classes mark future and unrealized (irrealis)
events with -u / -k, and realis events with -n. Class II verbs, in addition, mark past
completive events with -i (singular) or -ei (plural).
    The realis form is partially compatible with future time adverbials, although not in
independent utterances as in (169a). It can be used, however, with future time adverbials
in what appears to be a kind of neutral, timeless sense, as in (169b):
   (169)      a. *goraq      tsi ts-˙g-˙n
                 *tomorrow I      1-go-REAL
                 *‘I went tomorrow.’
              b. t˙~în   wi       a-t-ßn,        goraq      ts-ip-ßn
                 today house 1-make-REAL, tomorrow 1-sleep-REAL
                 ‘Today I build a house, tomorrow I sleep.’
    Irrealis, on the other hand, is fully compatible with future time. Thus, it can occur
with future time adverbials, or with present time adverbials extendable to a future reading,
as in the following:
   (170)      a. goraq     tsi t -a -an
                 tomorrow I      1-go-IRR
                 ‘Tomorrow I will go.’
              b. d˙baq tsi t -a -an
                 now      I   1-go-IRR
                 ‘I will go now.’ (‘I haven’t started yet, but I’m ready to go.’)
    Irrealis is not compatible with past time, (unless it occurs with incompletive -da, in
which case it carries a sense of ‘would have’ or ‘was about to’ – see §5.5.3.6). Its
incompatibility with past time adverbials is illustrated in the following example:
   (171)      *pyana        tsi t -a -an
              *yesterday I 1-go-IRR
              *‘Yesterday I will go.’                                            67

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––5.5.3.1.    Mutation
    In a small subset of Class I verbs (high frequency verbs like ‘go’ and ‘come’) a
process of “mutation,” is used in marking the realis–irrealis distinction.2 5 Apparently,
the process is old; it is being replaced by a newer and more regular affixation pattern.
For “mutating” verbs, then, there are two equivalent irrealis forms – those marked by
mutation (172b, 173b, and 175) and those marked by -k (176).
    Beginning with the realis conjugation as the default, all consonants and vowels used
for the irrealis form are “shifted” back one point of articulation – apical becomes
laminal, velar becomes uvular, ˙ becomes a, and u becomes o (see fn. 25). In such cases
the irrealis morpheme is a kind of autosegmental harmony process which spreads across
the whole of the root affecting all consonants and vowels. Following are examples:
    (172)      FIRST PERSON
               a. REALIS
                    tsi ts-˙g-˙n
                    I 1-go-REAL                  ‘I went.’
               b. IRREALIS
                  tsi t -a -an
                  I 1-go-IRR                     ‘I am going.’
    (173)      SECOND PERSON
               a. REALIS
                    nu n-˙g-˙n
                    you 2-go-REAL                ‘You went.’
               b. IRREALIS
                  nu ¯-a -an
                  you 2-go-IRR                   ‘You are going.’5.5.3.2.    Non-mutating Class I verbs
    In contrast to the mutating Class I verbs, the realis–irrealis distinction in the majority
of Class I verbs is marked by affixation patterns. Following are examples of irrealis
forms marked by the affixes -du (for singular) and -dak (for plural):
    (174)      REALIS                                   IRREALIS
               a. t-˙m-˙n                               t-˙m-du
                  1-eat-SG:REAL                         1-eat-SG:IRR
                  ‘I ate.’                              ‘I will eat.’
    25
        Whatever the original function of ‘mutation’ may have been, it shows evidence of having later
been morphologized to operate in several grammatical systems, not restricted to the realis–irrealis
distinction alone. In some transitivity diathesis alternations, for example, the marked parameter is
marked by mutation, as in: dzu≥-dzi ‘It hangs’ vs. mutated dzoˆ-a-dzi ‘He hung it.’ See also sections
§8.4, §9.2.1, §9.3.4, and §9.3.8 for the ‘mutating’ pattern in subordination.
        Though such marking systems are rare in the languages of the world, similar phenomena have
been reported in isolated cases. Jim Watters (1987) reports that in Tlachichilco Tepehua, a Totonacan
language of Mexico, second person subject agreement in verbs is marked by glottalizing all glottalizable
consonants – p, t, ts, ch, k, and q become p’, t’, ts’, ch’, k’, and , respectively.","[64, 65, 66, 67, 68]"

    A significant distinction is made between beg˙i ‘Kusunda’ (their gloss) and mihaq
‘Ban Raja’ (their gloss), the former word, apparently, being used as an even stronger
pejorative term than Kusunda.5 Though our informants seemed quite happy to accept
the word “Kusunda” as their Nepali exonymic caste name (even referring to themselves
as such), they were careful to make clear that they were mihaq Kusunda, not beg˙i
Kusunda. The words mentioned above are given in (1–3):

    The word for Damai (3f), a musician and tailor caste, appears to contain the TB root
tup ‘beat,’ which is common, too, in the Kham dialects of the region. The word for
Sarki (3g) contains the Kusunda root gid˙t ‘skin, leather.’ The word for ‘police’
gimtsamba (2b) contains three syllables and may be a neologism, though we are unaware
of the individual morphemes.
    Equally unusual for a hunter-gatherer people is the lack of distinction between
‘heart’ and ‘lung’ – both gobloq – or between ‘snake’ and ‘bug’ – both tu. Surrounding
tribes with hunting-gathering histories, like the Chepang, are renowned for making
minute anatomical distinctions. It is possible that many such distinctions have been
forgotten by the Kusundas since settling into sedentary, agricultural life. Though Reinhard    5
        The Nepali term begari (‘forced laborer’) is sometimes added to Kusunda (in Kusunda-begari)
as an abusive insult for a worthless person, and it is probably this term that is the source for the word
beg˙i. (Intervocalic ‘r’ is frequently dropped from the middle of Kusunda words borrowed from Nepali.)                                                  14

are very likely different renditions of the same word. Hodgson does not list heart or
liver.
    Most locative expressions have developed as metaphorical extensions of body-part
names. Though such metaphor is common in the languages of the world, the specific
associations found in Kusunda are not common in the languages of the immediate
region. ‘Behind’ s˙mba is also the word for ‘buttocks,’ and ‘inside’ gem˙t is also the
word for ‘stomach.’ A protrusion or body-part extension is referred to as a ‘body,’ as
in ‘horn’ ipi gidza≥, literally ‘head body.’
    The word for ‘leaf’ is commonly found as a classifier root for ‘book’ or ‘page’ in
South and Southeast Asia, and makes reference to ‘page’ in Nepali. In Kusunda, the
word for ‘leaf’ has been extended to also mean ‘book.’
    The word for ‘yellow’ derives from the word for tumeric, common also in TB
languages of the region (see fn. 23).","[13, 14, 15]"
"2.2.      Tibeto-Burman and other borrowings
    We encountered several words in Kusunda that appear to have Tibeto-Burman
origins. Given, however, that the vast majority of lexical items in Kusunda show no
resemblance whatever to other languages or language families of the region, we are
probably looking at borrowings from Kham, Magar, or Chepang. Following are the
words:
    (4)   a.   gwa         ‘egg’          <     gwa       Magar ‘chicken’
          b.   tu          ‘bug’          <     du        Magar ‘bug, insect’
          c.   h~aÚ        ‘face’         <     h~aÚ      Gamale Kham
          d.   p˙itoba     ‘Damai’        <     tæubla    Gamale Kham
          e.   p˙yet       ‘leech’        <     pyat      Chepang
          f.   ran         ‘millet’       <     r~aÚd˙i   Takale Kham
          g.   sat         ‘comb’         <     sat       Magar, Proto Kham
          h.   ip/im       ‘sleep’        <     ip/im     Proto Kham
          i.   am          ‘eat’          <     am        Chepang ‘rice’, Karen ‘eat’
          j.   hampe       ‘where’        <     hampe     Yamphu    Though the first two words, gwa ‘egg’ and tu ‘bug’ bear resemblance to Magar
words with similar meanings, the Magar words are decidedly unusual for Tibeto-Burman.
More common TB forms are ba or bwa for ‘chicken,’ and bu for ‘bug.’ It is possible
that the Magar forms were borrowed from Kusunda.
    The verb am ‘to eat’ in (4i) which corresponds to Karenic, may be purely accidental.
It occurs in none of the surrounding languages, except as ‘rice’ in Chepang. Perhaps
more difficult to explain is (4h), the word for ‘sleep.’ It seems unusual that such a word
would be borrowed. Furthermore, *ip is the Proto-Tibeto-Burman etymon for ‘sleep,’
and the word in its proto form cannot be found in the surrounding languages. Chepang
and Magar use different etyma. Gamale Kham has im- (also occurring in certain
paradigmatic forms in Kusunda), and Takale Kham has s-ep- as a causative ‘put to
sleep.’ One or both forms were certainly in use in Proto Kham, and may be the source
for Kusunda ip/im.
    Many more words have been borrowed from Nepali, a much more recent phenomenon
than borrowing from Tibeto-Burman. Our informants were reluctant to give us Nepali                                           15

    No one could have guessed, early in 2004, that before the year was out we would get
lucky with Kusunda. At the time, all we had were a couple of word lists, one from the
1850s and another from the 1970s; plus a short text that was largely uninterpretable.
We knew almost nothing about the grammar – doubly lamentable in light of the fact that
Kusunda was recognized as a language isolate, related to no other language on earth. In
some quarters, the last speaker was reported to have died in 1985, and though some
Nepalese linguists and anthropologists were aware of one or two Kusundas with a vague
memory of their ancestral tongue, the situation was not hopeful, and most of us had
resigned ourselves to the notion that we would never know more about Kusunda than
what we already knew.
    In the midst of this unpromising circumstance, our friends at the National Foundation
for the Development of Indigenous Nationalities (NFDIN), especially Vice-Chairman
Prof. Sant Bahadur Gurung and Member Secretary Mr. Tamla Ukyab, never gave up. It
is impossible to overemphasize our indebtedness to them. In April 2004, with help from
the National Indigenous Nationalities Women’s Forum, they brought three Kusundas to
Kathmandu from Dang Valley to help them with citizenship papers – a practical, first
step in helping them and making a simple thing like land ownership a possibility for
them. They also arranged a press conference in which they introduced the Kusundas to
the public and to the academic community – sociologists, anthropologists, and linguists.
It was there that we discovered that one of them, Ms. Gyani Maiya Sen, had more than a
passive knowledge of Kusunda; she could actually speak it!
    We, at the Central Department of Linguistics (CDL), Tribhuvan University, immediately
made a proposal to Prof. Gurung and Mr. Ukyab to help us in bringing Gyani Maiya
and possibly other Kusunda speakers into Kathmandu for a three month period of
intensive linguistic research. Their response was magnanimous. Not only did NFDIN
agree to fund the research and documentation project, they also sent one of their own
people, Mr. Dinesh Gurung, to Dang to bring the speakers to Kathmandu.
    Once in Kathmandu, Mr. Jagat Gurung, also of NFDIN, dealt with many practical
arrangements, like finding lodging for the Kusundas and taking them on weekend tours
to the zoo and to numerous religious sites. We are grateful for his willing contribution.
We are also grateful to Mr. Stephen Watters, of SIL and CDL, for making digital
recordings of many Kusunda sounds, and to Dinesh Khadga of Kantipur Photo Studio
for making video recordings of several elicitation sessions. All electronic media are now
housed at the CDL library, and make a valuable addition to their language archives.
    Without question, our greatest debt of gratitude goes to the Kusunda speakers who
accepted the invitation to come to Kathmandu – Ms. Gyani Maiya Sen, Ms. Kamala
Singh Khatri, and Mr. Prem Bahadur Shahi Thakuri. Back in Dang, Gyani Maiya
contacted Prem Bahadur, her uncle, and Prem Bahadur contacted Kamala, his niece, who
lived in Rolpa. Only Gyani Maiya had been to Kathmandu before, at the recent invitation
of NFDIN. But for all of them, a three month stay in Kathmandu was a leap of faith.
They were at the mercy of strangers, not knowing fully what to expect. When they
arrived, they quickly settled into their new situation, cheerfully sharing their language
and their lives.
    Four of us at CDL, Linguistics Chair Prof. Yogendra Prasad Yadava, Prof. Madhav
Prasad Pokharel, Mr. Balaram Prasain, and myself, had separate, daily sessions with our
new-found friends, keeping them busy the whole day long. Once a week, we debriefed
                                           5

of the linguistics department. I should make clear that the three participants do not
necessarily agree with all my interpretations presented in this grammar. Any and all
errors are my own.
    At the end of the research period, NFDIN hosted another press conference, at which
the Kusundas were fêted, and the principal investigators were given opportunity to
present their findings. An invited speaker, State Minister for Local Development Mr.
Krishna Gopal Shrestha, promised his support for projects aimed at uplifting indigenous
nationalities. Several other dignitaries, including Prof. Sant Bahadur Gurung, Prof.
Yogendra Prasad Yadava, Prof. Madhav Prasad Pokharel, Prof. Novel Kishore Rai, and
visiting Prof. Sueyoshi Toba, gave unanimous voice to the overriding value of language
documentation and preservation efforts. The conference was reported in all the major
Nepalese dailies for Asoj 24, 2061, BS (October 10, 2004).
    A special note of thanks goes to Professors R. M. W. Dixon and Alexandra Aikhenvald
for inviting me as an Honorary Visiting Fellow to their Research Centre for Linguistic
Typology (RCLT) at La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia. I was able to spend
three months, uninterrupted, analyzing my notes and writing the present grammar. I was
also given opportunity to present my findings and analysis at an RCLT seminar, receiving
valuable suggestions and comments from Robert Dixon, Alexandra Aikhenvald, Randy
LaPolla, John Saeed, Gerrold Sadock, Ghil‘ad Zuckermann, and John Hajek.
    I would also like to thank Alexandra Aikhenvald, Scott DeLancey, David Bradley,
Sueyoshi Toba, and Stephen Watters for reading an earlier draft of this grammar and
making valuable comments. I have not incorporated all of them, and any shortcomings
are my own.
    Last, but not least, I wish to thank the Himalayan Linguistics anonymous reviewer
who took a close, critical view of the first edition of this grammar (the NFDIN version)
and made a number of very helpful suggestions. Many of those recommendations I
have followed and incorporated into this current edition.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––Reinhard, an American anthropologist studying at the University of Vienna, found members
of the Kusunda tribe in Gorkha district, and then in Surkhet district a year later. He
collected a number of Kusunda words together with a short text narrated by Tek Bahadur,
and in 1970, with the help of Sueyoshi Toba, a Japanese linguist studying in Nepal, the
two co-authored an article – A Preliminary Linguistic Analysis and Vocabulary of the
Kusunda Language – published by the Summer Institute of Linguistics and Tribhuvan
University. Unfortunately, Toba had to work without the benefit of an informant, and
his transcriptions are based on what he could hear from Reinhard’s tape recordings. In
the text, too, many morphemes and their glosses are necessarily speculative with very
little to go on. Still, it was better than anything we had to date. Though the word list
differed in some respects from Hodgson’s list, the language was essentially the same.
     Reinhard published some additional Kusunda data in 1976, but for the most part,
our knowledge of the Kusundas and their language remained almost static from 1970 to
the present day.
     Ross Caughley, of the Summer Institute of Linguistics, made contact with a lone
speaker, Chudamani Ban Raja, in Rampur village of Palpa district in January 1980
(p.c.). The speaker was unaware of other Kusundas and reckoned that he was the last
surviving speaker. Caughley managed to elicit a few grammatical constructions and
some additional words, but apparently his findings were not substantive enough to
warrant publication (although he did include a single page of materials in his 1982 study
of the Chepang verb). Five years later, in 1985, Caughley attempted to contact Chudamani
a second time, but learned that he had already died. Also, in February 1983 and January
1984, Caughley traveled to some of the early Reinhard sites in Gorkha and met two
Kusundas in and around Cheptar Bazaar. Both were related to Reinhard’s informant,
but neither were able to speak Kusunda. They belonged to a younger generation.
     In the 1980s, word began to spread that the few remaining speakers known to
linguists and anthropologists were all deceased, and that their language had died with
them. The Ethnologue began to report in the 1990s that Kusunda had gone extinct,
saying that “three speakers were reported in 1970” and that “the last speaker was
reported to have died in 1985.” The claim is probably related to the death of Chudamani
Ban Raja.","[10, 11]"
"5.2.2.1.    The genitive
    The genitive suffix -yi/-ye (allomorph -i/-e following consonants) occurs primarily
on possessive pronouns (see §5.1.1) or on third person possessors in a possessor–pos-
sessee relationship. First or second person possession is marked primarily by possessive
prefixes. Following are examples of third person possession:
    (108)      a. ram-e             ag˙i
                  Ram-GEN           dog      ‘Ram’s dog’
               b. twi-ye           gida≥
                  bee-GEN          water     ‘bee’s honey’
    There are numerous other cases in which the possessive relationship is not marked
at all, especially in “part–whole” constructions. Thus, though ‘honey’ is marked for
possession in (108b), the semantically similar “body part relationships” are not generally
marked, as in:
    (109)      a. ata        gida≥
                  mouth      water           ‘saliva’
               b. i≥       gida≥
                  eye      water             ‘tears’
    What might be termed as “type relationships” are sometimes marked by the genitive,
sometimes not. We do not know if the choice is lexically determined or determined by
pragmatic notions like “degree or level of semantic union.” In the following examples,
the first is marked by the genitive, the second two are not.
    (110)      a. aidzi-gi 2 0      amba
                  goat-GEN          meat          ‘goat meat’
               b. numba          amba
                  cow            meat             ‘cow meat’                                             50

                  bird       offspring                 ‘chick’
     From the data we have so far, it appears that the genitive is not used to mark other
semantic relationships between nouns, like “composed of” or “location of,” as shown
in the following examples:
    (111)      a. ye≥gu wi
                  stone house                          ‘stone house’
               b. duga ab˙q
                  ground vegetable                     ‘mushroom’
   The genitive is also used in first or second person possession where a modifier
occurs between the possessor and the possessed item, as in (112b):
    (112)      a. tsi-wi
                  1S-house                             ‘my house’
               b. tsi-yi   ye≥gu          wi
                    1S-GEN stone          house        ‘my stone house’5.2.2.2.    The nominative and the accusative
    Situated in a sea of ergative marking languages, Kusunda, with its nominative-accusative
case marking system, stands out as a typological island. In Kusunda, there is no
distinction between transitive and intransitive subjects – both are zero marked. Nor is
there a marking distinction between third and non-third persons in transitive clauses (as
in “person-based” split ergatives), or between “more transitive” and “less transitive”
clauses (as in “volitionality” systems, or “stative-active” systems, or “aspectually-split”
systems). All of these ergative or ergative-variant systems occur in the languages of the
region, but, as far as we can tell, Kusunda has no ergative of any kind.
    The nominative argument in Kusunda is zero marked (unmarked), and the accusative
is marked by the nominal suffix -da. Following are examples of nominative and
accusative marking in intransitive and transitive clauses:
    (113)      a. tsi-Ø    limi-t-ßn
                  I-NOM dance-1-REAL
                  ‘I danced.’
               b. gina-Ø u-g-˙n
                  he-NOM come-3-REAL
                  ‘He came.’
               c. pyana       tsi-Ø n˙n-da        imba-d-i
                  yesterday I-NOM you-ACC think-1-PAST
                  ‘Yesterday I thought about you.’
    20
        The Kusunda genitive -yi/-y e looks a lot like the Kham genitive -yi/-y e, which has been related
by some to Tibetan -ki (DeLancey 1984). The -gi here seems to point to the same etymon. Without
further study we do not know under what conditions the genitive surfaces and -yi, and under what
conditions as -gi.","[50, 51]"

Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Clause chaining
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––Usually, all that is required is the addition of a dative argument3 7 to a transitive clause, as
in the following:
    (351)     a. BASIC TRANSITIVE:
                 tsi wi         a-t-ßn
                 I    house make-1-REAL
                 ‘I built a house.’
              b. BENEFACTIVE:
                 tsi gin-da        wi     a-t-ßn
                 I    him-DAT house make-1-REAL
                 ‘I built a house for him.’
    Such a construction is also available to some TB languages, but only on verbs that
are marginally bitransitive – verbs like ‘send’ or ‘show.’ Such verbs have transitive and
bitransitive uses, as in the following example from Tamang:

     In other TB languages, like Kham, the transitivity of verbs is fixed, and even verbs
like ‘send’ and ‘show’ are inherently transitive. For such verbs to be used in a
bitransitive (benefactive) sense requires an applicative derivation in the verb. The derivation
employs the verb ‘to give’ (with a non-literal reading) in a clause chaining construction:
    (353)     KHAM (from Watters 2002:239)
              a. TRANSITIVE USE:

                 he-ERG me-OBJ letter send-NF-GIVE-1S-PFV-3S
                 ‘He sent me a letter.’
    Nepali, like Tamang, has transitive and bitransitive senses for verbs like ‘send’ and
‘show.’ For verbs with a fixed transitive reading, however, Nepali, like Kham (and
Tamang), requires a benefactive derivation which employs a non-literal usage of the verb
‘to give.’   37
      It is also possible to use a modification of the Nepali -ko lagi, as in: tsi-lage limu-dzi
(me-FOR fight-TAM) ‘He fought for me’ (on my behalf). See the ‘benefactive’ under §5.2.2.4.","[129, 130]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––9.1.2       Non-finite adnominals formed from verbs
    In non-finite (or “neutral”) adnominals, the embedded verb has no person inflection,
but does have what appears to be a realis marker -˙n. As in §8.1.1, however, we will
gloss the marker as <NEUT> for “neutral” (recognizing too that it may be a nominalization
or a true morphological participle). The following two forms we have seen before in
non-embedded structures:
    (311)      a. tul-ßn       p˙idzi
                  wear-NEUT cloth
                  ‘worn clothes’
               b. dza -˙n tsya
                  buy-NEUT tea
                  ‘purchased tea’
    The verb form in (311a) occurs on a Class II intransitive, a verb type that is inherently
bereft of person marking (see §8.1.1). Person marking is not deleted to create a neutral
form. The form in (311b), however, occurs on a Class II transitive verb, a verb type that
inherently includes person marking. Its lack is a kind of deletion. Notice, too, that the
lack (or deletion) of subject person marking in transitive verbs, as in (311b), yields a
result semantically equivalent to a passive participle.","[113, 114]"
"10.1.1.1 Negation of the medial verb
   Where the medial verb in a clause chain is negated, the scope of negation is local – it
applies to that verb alone. Following are examples:
   (344)      a. tsi t-˙m-daÚ u          t-ug-un
                 I 1-eat-REAL:NEG        1-come-REAL
                 ‘I came without eating.’ (lit. ‘I didn’t eat, I came.’)

                 bathe-3-REAL:NEG 3-eat-REAL

   We have very few examples of this structure, but the ones that we do have often
imply “condition,” which will be treated more fully in §11.2. Following are two                                            126

                  ‘(If) we eat the medicine we won’t die.’

               ‘He bathed (but) he didn’t eat.’10.1.2      A second negative
   Both medial and final verbs sometimes employ a second negative. Though we can
surmise on the origin of its structure, we do not know how this negative differs semantically
from the one illustrated in §10.1.1 above. We give two examples of a medial verb
negated by this second negative (a–b), and one example of a final verb (c):
    (347)      a. gina po≈la kæaÚ i              g-˙m-˙n
                  he    bathe be:REAL:NEG 3-eat-REAL
                  ‘He didn’t bathe and he ate.’ (He ate without bathing.)
               b. wa     uga    kæaÚ i         un-da        ip-dzi
                  home come be:REAL:NEG trail-LOC sleep-TAM
                  ‘He didn’t come home and he slept on the trail.’ OR
                  ‘Not coming home, he slept on the trail.’
               c. gimi       meÚ-d-i     d~aba-n˙ kæaÚ i
                  money lose-1-PAST, find-2          be:REAL:NEG
                  ‘I lost the money and you didn’t find it.’
    Beginning with (347a), the expected negative form for a finite, realis Class II verb
would be po≈la-g-aÚi (bathe-3-REAL:NEG), the -g being a third person agreement marker.
The negative kæaÚi, on the other hand, is the negative existential copula, now used as
negation marker on non-copular verbs. (See Negative existential under §6.1.2.1.) The
use of copular verbs in modality systems, of course, is widespread in the languages of
the world, South Asia included. This is the first instance, however, that we have seen it
in Kusunda.
    In §8.1.4 we saw examples of bare verb roots used in concatenative structures like
hol t-˙m-du (cook 1-eat-IRR:SG) ‘I’ll cook and eat.’ The first root, hol, is followed by a
second finite root, t-˙m-du, without intervening morphology of any kind. The negative
construction that we are dealing with here is a parallel structure – the negative copula
follows the bare root. It is reasonable that such “bare root” verbs should be negated by
the existential, without all the finite machinery of conjugated verbs.
    The form of the final verb in (347c) is also unexpected. We would expect d~aba-n-aÚi
(find-2-REAL:NEG). Final verbs are always finite, being marked for TAM and person/num-                                            127
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Clause chaining
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––ber information, and (347c) manages to tack a second person marker -n˙ onto the end of
the first root. It is very likely, in fact, that the grammaticalization pathway for d~aba-n-aÚi
is < *d~aba-n˙ kæaÚi.
    It may turn out, then, after further study, that the “concatenative” structure is the
“real” clause chaining device and the structures illustrated in (342) are coordinated
“co-ranking” structures on the English model.","[126, 127, 128]"
"5.5.5.2.    Transitive imperatives
    Transitive imperatives are much more regular than their intransitive counterparts.
Most transitive imperatives are fashioned after the imperative of the verb ‘to make, to
do,’ whose root form is ˙- or a-. The morpheme ˙-go transfers across to (almost) all
transitive imperatives, as in the following sample:
    (198)     a.   bem ˙-go              ‘Trip him!’
              b.   pumba ˙-go            ‘Beat him!’
              c.   d~aba ˙-go            ‘Find it!’
              d.   kisa ˙-go             ‘Cut it!’
              e.   unda ˙-go             ‘Show it!’
              f.   hab˙ ˙-go             ‘Roast it!’
              g.   t˙mb˙ ˙-go            ‘Send it!’
              h.   borl˙ ˙-go            ‘Boil it!’
              i.   dzaÚ ˙-go             ‘Buy it!’
              j.   abi ˙-go              ‘Carry it!’
              k.   toba ˙-go             ‘Sew it!’
    Because most transitive verbs take the syntactic form of a “light verb” (i.e. some
nominal notion plus the semantically empty verb ‘to do’), many such verbs are intransitive
in force, as in the following:
    (199)     a.   imba ˙-go             ‘Think!’
              b.   nikæe ˙-go            ‘Laugh!’
              c.   lol˙ ˙-go             ‘Cry out!’
              d.   ya≥ ˙-go              ‘Defecate!’
              e.   an ˙-go               ‘Urinate!’
   An exception to the generalization that transitive imperatives are fashioned after the
verb ‘to do’ is in the case of Class I verbs – those with prefixed person marking. In
such cases the imperative verb is conjugated for second person. This phenomenon is                                            77
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Word classes
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––much more common in intransitive verbs, as can be seen in §5.5.6.1. We have a single
example in transitive verbs:
    (200)      n-ukan2 9         ‘Know it!’ / ‘Figure it out!’5.5.6.      Prohibitives
     Prohibitives, both transitive and intransitive, are marked by the suffix -in (allomorphs
-en, -˙n, -yin) following the verb root. As with imperatives, most (but not all) transitive
prohibitives are built on the prohibitive form of the verb ‘to do, make’ – ˙-yin ‘Don’t do
it!’ Following are examples:
    (201)      a.   bem ˙-yin               ‘Don’t trip him!’
               b.   pumba ˙-yin             ‘Don’t beat him!’
               c.   d~aba ˙-yin             ‘Don’t allow it!’
               d.   kisa ˙-yin              ‘Don’t cut it!’
               e.   unda ˙-yin              ‘Don’t show it!’
               f.   hab˙ ˙-yin              ‘Don’t roast it!’5.5.6.1.    Intransitive and transitive Class I prohibitives
    Intransitive prohibitives and Class I prohibitives are simpler than those illustrated in
(201) in that they occur without the “helping” verb ‘to do, make.’ In addition, with
Class I verbs (see (202–203)), the root is preceded by the second person pronominal
prefix n-. (Note that the pronominal prefix also occurs potentially on transitive imperatives,
though only a single example has been found – ‘Know it!’ (see (200).)
    (202)      CLASS I INTRANSITIVES (includes pronominal prefix):
               a. n-ip-in
                  2-sleep-PROH                ‘Don’t sleep!’
               b. n-o -˙n
                  2-die-PROH                  ‘Don’t die!’
    (203)      CLASS I TRANSITIVES (includes pronominal prefix):
               a. n-im-in
                  2-forget-PROH               ‘Don’t forget it!’
               b. n-˙m-in
                  2-eat-PROH                  ‘Don’t eat it!’
               c. ¯-aˆ -yin
                  2-look-PROH                 ‘Don’t look at it!’
    (204)      CLASS II INTRANSITIVES (without pronominal prefix):
               a. bem-in
                  fall-PROH                   ‘Don’t fall!’
               b. phu-yin
                  jump-PROH                   ‘Don’t jump!’
    A strange alternative set is available for the forms in (202) which, on the surface,    29
        This form is identical with second person realis n-uk-an (2-know-REAL). First person realis is
t-ukan, and third person ukan-dzi.","[77, 78]"

10. Clause chaining
    “Clause chaining” is a clause combining strategy very common in the languages of
South Asia and syntactically distinct from English-type “co-ranking” structures like He
went to the forest and set traps. A basic feature common to classical clause chaining
languages is the distinction between chain-medial and chain-final verbs. Typically, the
verb belonging to the chain-final clause is the most finite, being marked for things like
person/number agreement and tense/aspect distinctions. Verbs belonging to chain-medial
clauses, on the other hand, are less finite, sometimes pared down to a simple verb root
plus some kind of non-final marker. Thus, it is termed “co-subordinate.” It is
subordinate in that it depends on the final verb for certain finite specifications, but
coordinate in that it lacks many features of true subordinates (Haspelmath 1995).
    With respect to clause chaining, Kusunda is typologically distinct from the languages
immediately surrounding it. First of all it distinguishes on a temporal scale between
“sequential” events and “overlapping” events, and secondly, it marks sequential events
as “co-ranking” and overlapping events as “co-subordinate.” In the surrounding
languages, like Nepali and Kham, there is no formal distinction between sequential and
overlapping events, and the only strategy employed is the co-subordinate one.","[124, 125]"

        It is interesting to note that in Reinhard and Toba’s (1970) description, the word for ‘son’ is
listed as duguci [dugutsi], which also, very likely, includes a contracted form for [getse] ‘child,
offspring.’                                                 23
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Phonology
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––4.3.       Vowels
   As already mentioned, Kusunda has six vowels, three forming an upper set and three
forming a lower set, as in the following:
   (9)       Kusunda vowels:
                i           u
                      ˙
                e           o
                      a
    In terms of absolute contrasts, it is difficult to find contrastive pairs of words in
which the consonants remain constant, but one word utilizes a vowel from the upper set
and the other word utilizes the corresponding vowel from the lower set – i.e. minimal
pairs for vowels. In many words, especially within polysyllabic morphemes, there is a
certain amount of free variation between the two sets (as borne out in tape recordings
from one day to the next). Following are examples:
    (10)     Variation between [i] and [e]:
              a. gitsi          ~       getse            ‘child’
              b. gip˙n          ~       gep˙n            ‘language’
              c. gidzi          ~       gidze            ‘name’
              d. mihaq          ~       mehaq            ‘Kusunda’
              e. yi≥gu          ~       ye≥gu            ‘stone’
   Interestingly, the variation reported in (10a) constitutes a minimal pair in careful
speech:
    (11)       a. gitsi         ‘thorn’
               b. getse         ‘child’
     Likewise, similar variation occurs between [u] and [o] as well as between [˙] and [a],
as illustrated in the following examples:
   (12)      Variation between [u] and [o]:
              a. gulu≥         ~       golo≥             ‘round’
              b. mu≥           ~       mo≥               ‘king’
              c. hyudzi         ~       hyodzi           ‘fat, swollen’
              d. tukan         ~       tokan             ‘know’
              e. hul˙dßn       ~       holadßn           ‘I cooked it.’
    (13)     Variation between [˙] and [a]:
              a. gidz˙≥         ~       gidza≥           ‘body’
              b. k˙p˙≥          ~       k˙pa≥            ‘tumeric’
              c. hul˙dßn        ~       holadßn          ‘I cooked it.’
    As with the contrast between gitsi ‘thorn’ and getse ‘child’ illustrated in (11), with
these vowels too, contrastive pairs can be found, as in the following:
    (14)       a. pæuÚdzi       ‘He jumped.’
               b. pæoÚdzi       ‘He shot.’
    (15)       a. gip˙n         ‘language’
               b. gipan         ‘flower’                                             24

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    It turns out that much of the free variation we encountered occurs in polysyllabic
words where [h] or one of the velar sounds [k], [g], or [≥] occurs. It is significant, in
this respect, that uvular sounds, especially the voiced ones [ ], and [ˆ], occur only with
vowels [o] and [a], displaying a kind of harmony within a syllable.7 It is not altogether
surprising, then, to find their neighbors, the velar sounds, somewhat ambivalent in their
preference of upper or lower vowels.
    Though minimal contrasts are rare in our data set, the following words and morphemes
further illustrate the contrast between upper vowels [i, u, ˙] and lower vowels [e, o, a]:
    (16)     [i]                                             [e]

    (See also the contrast between inchoative ˙- ‘become’ and causative a- ‘make’ in
§6.1.4 and example (243).)4.3.1.     Vowels and uvular consonants
   Only vowels [o] and [a] can occur following uvular consonants.8 The constraint,
however, is unidirectional – it is a constraint on the consonant, not on vowels. Other
consonants, too, can occur with [o] or [a], as in the following:
    (19)     a. qan                 ‘itch’
             b. kan                 ‘sharp’
             c. ˙ga                 ‘Come!’
    (20)     a. qolom               ‘bad’
             b. kolumu              ‘owl’
             c. goloq               ‘sheep’    7
          This occurs also in Eskimo-Aleut. Bergsland (1997:21) reports that the vowels [u], [i], and [a]
occur before labial or velar consonants, but in contact with uvular consonants they become [o], [e], and
[a], all retracted.
    8
        In Reinhard and Toba’s transcription all [q]s are followed by an [a] or [o], though they too seem
to have found some phonemic evidence for a [k] vs. [q] contrast in central vowels.","[23, 24, 25]"
"5.2.1.      Number marking
    There is no number marking for nouns in Kusunda. Plurality of referents can be
marked using numerals or quantifiers, or by plural agreement affixes in the verb, as in

    We have already seen some case marking in pronouns – the oblique forms used for
the genitive and the accusative. In both cases, in addition to being marked by suffixes,
the underlying shape of the pronoun was also modified (see Table 2). This modification
presumably reflects an older case marking system. As far as we know, there is no
oblique modification for noun stems in Kusunda, nor are there oblique forms for
pronouns other than in the genitive and in the accusative.","[49, 50]"

Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Phonology
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    This observation will be important to our argument later on, that the “mark” in
certain grammatical systems is more than a shift from high vowel to low vowel, but
includes also a “retracting” shift in the word’s consonants (see §5.5.3.1).
    The uvular consonant [q] is less restricted in terms of the vowels that can precede it.
We have examples of [q] at the end of a syllable preceded by [i] or [˙], as in:
    (21)     a. ukæi-q-ßn9          ‘ruined’
             b. ˙r˙q                ‘garlic’4.3.2.     Pharyngealization of vowels and lowering of pitch
    Tibeto-Burman languages spoken in the regions surrounding Kusunda, namely Magar
and Kham, have “voice-register” systems, in which “lax” register vowels (opposed to
“modal” or “normal” register vowels), are manifested by breathy phonation and a
concomitant lowering of absolute pitch levels on the syllable. In both languages, breathiness
can sometimes be traced to the loss of a prefixed *s- on the syllable, as in:
    (22)     a. *s-rus > Magar rhus; Kham ruhs
             b. *s-ma≥ > Magar mha≥; Kham m~ïÚh
    Where breathiness occurs on syllables beginning in voiced stops, the auditory impact
is somewhat similar to the “voiced aspirates” of Indo-Aryan languages, though, in fact,
they arise from different phenomena. The practical orthographies of both languages,
written in Devanagri, represent them as voiced aspirates.
    In other Tibeto-Burman languages of Nepal, especially in the Tibetic and Tamangic
languages, “low register” is linked historically to the voicing of syllable initials, and
practical orthographies in Devanagri often represent the difference between low and high
registers as a difference in voicing.
    What we refer to here as “pharyngealization” in Kusunda, though also yielding a
concomitant lowering of pitch on the affected syllable, is historically and qualitatively
different from what has been described for Tibeto-Burman or Indo-Aryan. Pharyngeal-
ization in Kusunda is linked to the following voiced uvular consonants [ ] or [ˆ].1 0 The
effect is regressive, i.e. it affects preceding vowels, not so much following ones.
    Pharyngealization in Kusunda produces sounds very different from the sounds of
breathiness in Tibeto-Burman. Pharyngealization is manifested by a “ratchety” quality
on the vowel, almost as dramatic as the cawing of a crow, and on a spectogram displays
a wave form with a series of rapidly occurring strirations, as in the left side of Figure 1:
    9
        The -q here fits the morphological system as -q (anti-causative), but may be phonetically altered
to -k by the preceding high, front vowel.
    10
        Uvular and pharyngeal consonants have been noted elsewhere too for their pharyngealizing effect
on preceding vowels. Gerrold Sadock (p.c.) reports that voiced uvular [ ] in Greenlandic Eskimo is
barely audible, its presence being perceived mostly by its modifying effect on preceding vowels.
Ghil‘ad Zuckermann (p.c) reports a similar pharyngealization in Arabic, and John Saeed (p.c.) the same
for Cushitic languages. Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996:168) claim that the so-called pharyngeal
fricatives of Semitic languages are “often neither pharyngeals nor fricatives” but better termed as
approximants.","[25, 26]"
"    • Optative in Class II verbs. The most regular optative forms are those for Class II
transitive verbs, i.e. those patterned after the verb ‘to do, make.’ Recall that such verbs
were also very regular in the imperative, empoying the suffix ˙-go ‘Do it!’ / ‘Make it!’
(see examples in (198)). Here the suffix empoyed is -˙ge, fashioned after the optative
form of ‘do’: ˙-ge ‘May he do it!’ Following are examples:
    (214)                               IMPERATIVE                    OPTATIVE

              b.   ‘give’               e-go                          e-ge

    There is some confusion about another optative form -gya that occurs on the verb
‘to be, to become,’ as in: ˙-gya ‘Let it be!’ The form occurs erratically on other
intransitive verbs as well, which might suggest that this is an intransitive form. Among
them are lim-gya ‘Let him dance!’; b˙l-gya ‘Let him descend!’; sip-gya ‘Let him
enter!’; and dziu-gya ‘Let it leak!’ Significantly, however, the form occurs just as
frequently on transitive verbs, as in kis˙-gya ‘Let him cut it!’; and tsim˙n-gya ‘Let him
touch it!.’ Are we dealing here with a transcription error, with ˙gya being the same form
as ˙ge? Probably not.
    Interestingly, the form, wherever it occurs, is almost always transcribed without the
intervening schwa: -gya, but not ˙-gya. Given further that the optative form of the verb
‘to go’ is g-ya, with g- being separable as a third person prefix (which, as we saw
earlier, occurs in the optative form of all Class I verbs; see (212)), it is probable that we
are looking at a grammaticalized verb ‘go’ tacked on as a suffix as in: hui-gya ‘Let it
go fly!’; m˙b˙-gya ‘Let him go hear!’3 0 (We also saw in (211b) that ‘go/get’ is used
as a basis for some hortative constructions.)
    Assuming that our analysis is correct, and that -gya is a ‘go’ optative, we are left
with a residue of intransitive verbs that form the optative with the suffix -ta (allomorphs
-da and -na), or -ya. This is analogous to the intransitive imperative formed by the
suffix -to (allomorphs -do and -no in the same environments as optative -da and -na)
and fits our analysis well. Following are examples:
       (215)                                 IMPERATIVE                OPTATIVE

    There are several heterogeneous classes of words traditionally called adverbs that
have in common that they modify events or states (i.e. verbs or adjectives). The more
traditional ones are relatable to question words like ‘how,’ ‘where,’ ‘when,’ and ‘how
many’ as adverbs of ‘manner,’ ‘place,’ ‘time,’ and ‘quantity’ respectively, and will be
organized as such here.","[81, 82]"

–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    • Intransitive patterns. A slightly different suffixing pattern emerges for Class II
intransitive verbs. The pronominal marker is more complete, very nearly a complete
copy of the free pronoun. Following are examples:
   (145)           ENTER            DANCE              DESCEND         FALL
           1s      sip-tsi-n        limi-tsi-n         b˙l-tsi-n       pæep-tsi-n
           2s      sip-n-in         limi-n-in          b˙l-n-in        pæep-n-in
    Very commonly, such verbs occur in “neutral” conjugations, bereft of person markers,
as in: tsi sip-ßn ‘I entered,’ nu sip-ßn ‘You entered’; tsi b˙l-ßn ‘I descended,’ nu b˙l-ßn
‘You descended.’ Such conjugations are developing yet another set of pronominal
markers, tacking them on at the end, as in: tsi sip-ßn-tsi ‘I entered,’ and nu sip-ßn-nu
‘You entered.’
    Thus, we get considerable variation for intransitive person markers, as illustrated in
the following:
   (146)        a. tsi   sip-ßn
                   I     enter-REAL               ‘I entered.’
                b. tsi   sip-tsi-n
                   I     enter-1-REAL             ‘I entered.’
                c. tsi   sip-ßn-tsi
                   I     enter-REAL-1             ‘I entered.’    • Transitive–intransitive distinction. There are several transitivizing devices in
Kusunda (see §7.1), but here we will treat the transitive–intransitive distinction which is
marked by affixation type. That is, the transitive vs. intranstive reading of some verbs
depends solely on whether the affixation pattern used is a transitive pattern or an
intransitive pattern. In a sense, then, they are ambitransitive. Most inherent intransitive
verbs fall into this class.
    In the following examples, the same verb root is used in both a transitive and an
intransitive sense. The correct reading (transitive or intransitive) depends on the type of
affixation. As mentioned earlier, the transitive pattern is fashioned after the verb ‘to do,
to make,’ and may, in fact, be a verb concatenation (as we treat it in the following
glosses):
   (147)        a. INTRANSITIVE

    Until now, we have illustrated person marking patterns only in realis mode. There is
also an irrealis mode, and for all transitive verbs a past tense. Though first person -t,
second person -n, and third person -g are constant across all TAM categories, the
combinatory patterns that emerge are slightly different for realis, irrealis, and past tense.
These differences will be discussed in §5.5.3 on TAM marking.","[61, 62, 63]"
"9.3.9      Know how
    The verb ‘to know’ in Kusunda expresses the notion of ‘how to do something’ and
can include abstractions like gina gip˙n uk-an-dzi (he language know-REAL-<??>) ‘He
knows Kusunda (= He knows how to speak Kusunda)’. Knowing a person employs a
different verb tsirma- ‘recognize,’ which is used as a matrix verb for ‘believe.’ (See
§9.3.10.)
    In our corpus of data we have only cases in which both the matrix verb ‘know’ and
the embedded complement verb are coded as realis:
   (340)      a. tsi wi     a-t-ßn           t-uk-an

Class I verbs mark the person of the subject with a verbal prefix – first person ts- or t-;
second person n-; and third person g-, d-, or Ø. Realis plural in such verbs is marked
by a suffix -da immediately following the root, and singular goes unmarked. Realis is
marked by -n following number markers.
    In Class I irrealis, singular is marked by -du (a singular–non-past portmanteau) and
plural by -da. Irrealis (by a purely synchronic analysis) is marked by -k following the
plural marker and unmarked following singular.",[158]

Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Morphology of subordinate structures
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    • On Class I verbs. The embedded verbs that we saw in §8.2.1 can also appear in
their person-inflected forms. There is no apparent difference in meaning (though there
certainly may be subtle differences). In such cases, the purposive morpheme -da
participates in a person agreement paradigm, such that -d-a marks first person environments
and -n-a marks second person environments. Third person reverts back to -da (there is
no -g-a). Thus, this form contrasts with the uninflected -da forms in the following way:
   (300)     UNINFLECTED -DA:
             a. tsi am-da        t-ug-un
                I eat-PURP 1-come-REAL
                ‘I came to eat.’
             INFLECTED -DA:
             b. tsi t-˙m-d-a      t-ug-un
                I    1-eat-1-PURP 1-come-REAL
                ‘I came to eat.’
             c. nu n-˙m-n-a        n-ug-un
                you 2-eat-2-PURP 2-come-REAL
                ‘You came to eat.’
             d. gina g-˙m-da      u-g-i
                he 3-eat-PURP come-3-PAST
                ‘He came to eat.’
    In (300b) and (300c) the purposive marker is no longer simply -da, as we had in
§8.2.1 and also in (300a). Rather, the forms are inflected for first and second persons –
-d-a and -n-a, respectively. Also, the form of the embedded verb includes prefixed
person markers – t-, n-, and g-.
    The paradigms for these verbs are irregular, as is generally true for all Class I verbs.
Thus, the third person form of ‘eat’ includes a third person prefix g-. With the verb ‘to
sleep,’ however, such a form is disallowed. We get ip-da but not *g-ip-da. With the
verb ‘to fetch, get’ there is no first, second, third person inflection for the purposive
morpheme -da. Rather, all forms take the second person -na form of the purposive and
a third person g- prefix on the verb stem irregardless of person:
   (301)     a. g-i-na            t-ug-un
                3-fetch-PURP      1-come-REAL
                ‘I came to get (it).’
             b. g-i-na         n-ug-un
                3-fetch-PURP   2-come-REAL
                ‘You came to get (it).’
             c. g-i-na          u-g-i
                3-fetch-PURP    2-come-REAL
                ‘He came to get (it).’
     That g- is a person prefix can be seen in the following inflections: ts-i-di ‘I fetched
it’; n-i-di ‘You fetched it’; g-i-di ‘He fetched it.’
     Some Class I verbs have suppletive roots that are used with the -da construction.
The verb ‘to go’ is one of them. (302a) shows the base form as a benchmark, and
(302b) shows the suppletive form:                                           110

always an “inflected -da,” i.e. the morpheme has different representations for first,
second, and third persons. (An exception can be found in §8.2.2.) Here, a third person
-g-a is also possible:
      (303)   a. tsi amba hul˙-d-a      t-ug-un

                 he/she meat cook-3-PURP come-3-PAST
                 ‘He/she came to cook meat.’
   Recall that in Class II verbs the suffix -d is almost always a marker of first person,
contrasting with second person -n and third person -g. In Class I verbs, the -d that
occurs in an identical phonological sequence is not the same -d, but part of the following
morpheme. So far, we have seen the following distinctions:
      (304)   CLASS I:                      CLASS II:
              -di        ‘past’             -d-i        ‘first person–past’
                                            -n-i        ‘second person–past’
              -da        ‘plural’           -d-a        ‘first person–plural’
                                            -n-a        ‘second person ‘plural’
              -du        ‘irrealis’         -d-u        ‘first person–irrealis’
                                            -n-u        ‘second person–irrealis’

                                            -n-a        ‘second person–purposive’8.3       Finite embedded structures
    Many constructions whose embedded verb can be marked by a neutral, non-finite
form, or marked by -da, can also be marked as finite. Thus, the following (a) and (b)
sentences contrast in form, but we are unaware of any semantic differences:
      (305)   a. tsi wi       ˙n-da         ~oˆ la-d-i
                 I house make-PURP want-1-PAST
                 ‘I wanted to build a house.’
              b. tsi wi       a-t-ßn          ~oˆ la-d-i
                 I house make-1-REAL want-1-PAST
                 ‘I wanted to build a house.’                                           111
Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Morphology of subordinate structures
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––    For some verbs, especially Class II transitives, there are three contrasing forms, as in
the following:
      (306)   a. kæaidzi hab˙-˙n        t-ug-un
                 food      cook-NEUT 1-come-REAL
                 ‘I came to cook food.’
              b. kæaidzi hab˙-d-a       t-ug-un
                 food      cook-1-PURP 1-come-REAL
                 ‘I came to cook food.’
              c. kæaidzi hab˙-d-ßn         t-ug-un
                 food      cook-1-REAL 1-come-REAL
                 ‘I came to cook food.’ / ‘I cooked food and came.’
    There are limits on the finiteness of the subordinated verb. In general, the more
finite the embedded verb, the greater the likelihood that two different events are being
coded. The sentence in (306c), for example, could also be interpreted to mean ‘I cooked
food and came.’ Based on the same principle, the embedded verb in some constructions
must be marked with the same TAM as the matrix verb. Both verbs convey the same
event:
      (307)   a. wi       a-t-ßn         tumb˙-d-ßn
                 house make-1-REAL finish-1-REAL
                 ‘I finished building the house.’
              b. wi       a-d-i           tumb˙-d-i
                 house make-1-PAST finish-1-PAST
                 ‘I finished building the house.’
              c. *wi    a-t-ßn      tumb˙-d-i
                 *house make-1-REAL finish-1-PAST
   We will deal more with the specifics of TAM interplay when we deal with specific
constructions in §9, and in §10 on co-subordinate structures.","[109, 110, 111, 112]"
"5.5.3.4.    TAM in subordinate clauses
     The distinction between realis and the more specific (more “marked”) past-completive
is relevant to subordinate clauses as well. With the so-called “implicative” verbs, those
in which the matrix verb implies that the subordinated event actually happened, the tense

    (177)     a. wi       a-t-ßn         tumb˙-d-ßn
                 house make-1-REAL finish-1-REAL
                 ‘I finished making the house.’
              b. wi       a-d-i          tumb˙-d-i

                 *house make-1-REAL      finish-1-PAST
                 (ungrammatical)
    In other constructions, where the eventuality named by the matrix verb and the
eventuality named by the subordinate verb are different events, the TAM marking need
not match, as in the following:
    (178)     a. tsi wi        a-t-ßn         l˙mba-d-u
                 I    house make-1-REAL 1-learn-IRR
                 ‘I will learn how to build houses.’
              b. gina amba hab˙-g-i         tsi    ts-~aˆ -dzi
                 he    meat roast-3-PAST I         1-see-TAM
                 ‘I saw him roasting meat.’

"9.1.2.2     Levels of transitivity in adnominal modifiers
    There can be various levels of transitivity in adnominals derived from verbs. The
most transitive are those with fully finite transitive verbs (315e), and the least transitive
are those with Class II intransitive verbs where S equals O (315a). (Not all transitive
verbs have a Class II intransitive counterpart as the following verb does.) It will be
easier to describe transitivity levels (a), (b), and (c) by using Nepali equivalents in
addition to English. We begin with the least transitive:
    (315)     a. yo-˙n       amba
                 cook-REAL meat
                 ‘cooked meat’ / Nep. ‘pakeko masu’ (intransitive)
              b. hol-di    amba
                 cook-ADJ meat
                 ‘cooked meat’ / Nep. ‘pakeko masu’ (intransitive)
                 ‘cooking meat’ / Nep. ‘p˙kaune masu’
              c. hul-˙n       amba

                 ‘cooked meat’
                 ‘meat that has been cooked (by s.o)’
                 Nep. ‘p˙kaeko masu’ (transitive)
              d. hul˙-g-˙n    amba
                 cook-3-REAL meat
                 ‘cooked meat’ / ‘meat cooked by someone’ / ‘meat cooked by
                 him’

Watters: Kusunda Grammar; Syntax of subordinate structures
–––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––                e. hul˙-d-ßn      amba
                   cook-1-REAL meat
                   ‘meat that I cooked’
    The verb in (315a) is a suppletive intransitive form of the verb ‘to cook’ and always
implies intransitivity with S equalling O. The -di form in (315b) is an adjectival form
that is available to only a few transitive verbs. The form in (315c) is a neutral form, used
primarily by Kamala and derived from an earlier third person generic form. It is
transitive, but with no agent in view. The third person generic form is given in (315d).
It can also be a specific third person form. The form in (315e) is a first person form
which is never used in a generic sense, and implies full transitivity.
    It is instructive to contrast the ‘cook’ verb above with another verb whose intransitive
semantics implies that S equals A. The Kusunda verb for ‘hide’ is such a verb.
Furthermore, the inherent form of the verb is intransitive. (For ‘cook’ there are two
inherent forms – an intransitive yo- and a transitive hol-.) With ‘hide,’ because S equals
A, the intransitive adnominal must modify an animate noun, as in:
    (316)       a. hyoq-ßn      amba
                   hide-REAL animal
                   ‘hidden / hiding animal’
                b. *hyoq-ßn   gimi
                   *hide-REAL money
    Our informants’ explanation for the ungrammaticality of (b) is “because money
cannot hide itself.” Thus, where there is no inherent O intransitive verb, the passive
adnominal must be formed off the causativized version of the verb, and the only “passive”
form available to such verbs is Kamala’s “neutral” form or Gyani Maiya’s “generic
third person” form:
(317)       a. Kamala:
               hyo -a-˙n             gimi
               hide-CAUS-REAL        money
               ‘hidden money’
            b. Gyani Maiya:
               hyo -a-g-˙n          gimi
               hide-CAUS-3-REAL     money
               ‘hidden money’ (by someone)
     This contrasts sharply with those forms that are inherently transitive and are detransi-
tivized by anti-causative derivation, like the forms in (312).","[115, 116]"
