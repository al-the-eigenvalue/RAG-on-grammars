Table 4.16: Morphosyntactic and semantic features of adjectives4.3.1 Attributive function
Attributive adjectives qualify a noun in some way. It seems that the only possible
word order for attributive adjectives is that they precede the subject (123), (124). If
this is true, the only exceptions from the regular word order appear with predicative
adjectives but not with adjectives in attributive function.

                                                          (Vellard 1949:151)
In most cases attributive adjectives do not take any other morphemes (123), (124) (cf.
Croft 2003:185) but it is only the adjectival stem that precedes the subject. The only
grammatical morphemes attached to adjectives in attributive function are the clausal
clitics declarative -cay (125) and Topic marker -fa' (125), although this occurs rarely.

200                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
As with predicative adjectives, the decision to inflect attributive adjectives with
either the declarative or the Topic marker is one of focus and topic and is therefore
subject to the speaker's intention.
     If there are modifiers or the negation particle ana, they precede both adjective
and subject.
(127)         [...] ana ci cuni qhasi
                     no that good water
              '[...]; that is not good water.'             (Vellard 1967:11)
(128)         ci cauk para
              that big      stick
              'that big stick'                             (Métraux 1935:100)4.3.2 Predicative function
Predicative adjectives are found in the form of either adjectival predicate clauses or
as adjectives in predicative function. The former is understood as a clause in which
the adjective itself is the predication whereas the latter describes a clause in which it
makes a predication about a noun.
     Adjectival predicate clauses most often have the form of adjective plus
declarative -cay followed by the demonstrative pronoun //' 'this' plus Topic marker
(129)         kuma-cay ti-ki
              clean-DEC this-TOP
              'This is clean.'
              Ckuma ca-tiki')                              (Vellard 1951:11)
Adjectives in predicative function most commonly follow the subject although there
are some counterexamples. Declarative -cay is attached to the adjective in most
cases.
(130)         si:         k 'utini-cay
              sun(light) warm-DEC
              'The sun(light) is warm.'                    (Vellard 1950:65)
In both forms the adjective can take predicator -kasi 'to be' which itself can be
followed by declarative -cay. The use of -kasi is limited to the predicative use of
adjectives (10) although they can also occur without -kasi (cf. 4.3).
(131)         cuni-kasi-cay?
              gOOd-PRE-DEC
              'Are you well?' (lit: 'Be good?')            (Uhle 1894:66.1)
(132)         /;' soni-ki tsitsit(-cay) listo-kasf
              this man-TOP ? (-DEC) ready-PRE
              'This man is ready.'                         (Métraux 1935:105)
  listo is a loan from Spanish
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOMINAL SYSTEM                                                                         201
If there are adverbs or the negation ana they precede the adjective in an adjectival
predicate clause. In these cases, adverbs are not marked morphologically.
(133)          inawis       uca-cay      ti-ki
               rather/quite small-DEC this-TOP
               'This is rather / quite small.'
               ('inawis ucacatikV)                                    (Métraux 1935:103)
(134)          ana ci       cuni...
               NEG that good...
               'That is not good ...'                                 (Vellard 1967:2)
When adjectives in predicative function are modified by adverbs, we find three
different possibilities for word order. There is a strong tendency to place the subject
before the adjective:
                -     SUB     ADJ      ADV
                -     SUB     ADV      ADJ
                -     ADV     SUB      ADJ
The position of the sentence's constituents probably depends on focus (marked with
-cay) and the speaker's intention, as the following examples demonstrate:
(135)          wata-kfij       aski-cay   iyai
               village-TOP far-DEC        more
               'The village is further away.'                         (Métraux 1935:100)
(136)          wata      iya-cay      aski-n
               village more-DEC far-?
               'The village is further away.'                         (Métraux 1935:104)
In sum, the most common word order in adjectival predicate clauses is: adjective
inflected with declarative -cay followed by a demonstrative pronoun inflected with
topic marker -ki. When there are adverbs, they precede the entire construction.
      For adjectives in predicative function one can state that the subject mostly
precedes the adjective while adverbs are free in their position according to focus and
the speaker's intention435.","[216, 217, 218]"
"3.4.2 Noun incorporation
As Croft (2003:168) puts it, ""[n]oun incorporation is the phenomenon by which a
noun is so closely bound to a verb grammatically that it is considered to be part of
it."". Thus, noun incorporation can be viewed as a subcategory of compounding and is
therefore likewise a derivational process. Croft (2003:169) further points out that
direct objects are the nouns which are most likely to be incorporated, while Anderson
(1985:54) adds that subjects of intransitive verbs may also be incorporated.
      The analysis of noun incorporation in Uchumataqu is affected by the same
source-related methodological restrictions as nominal compounding, but there are
two particular factors that contribute to an even higher degree of uncertainty. First,
Uchumataqu does not mark a direct object morphologically and thus, noun
incorporation cannot be attested by the non-application of a particular morphological
marker. Second, since the principal word order is SOV it is often not determinable
syntactically whether an item is an instance of noun incorporation or a simple
nominal phrase (subject or direct object) followed by a verb phrase, as in example
(38).
(38)      kunua     pek-u-cay
          woman want-lSG-DEC
          'I want a woman (= wife).'                  (Vellard 1967:14)
Therefore, the most reliable means to establish noun incorporation are semantic (as is
the case with nominal compounding), i.e. the degree of lexicalisation and
compositionality. In some cases, morphological markers, such as clitics, indicate that
the item in question is not an instance of noun incorporation.
      Uchumataqu hardly ever employs noun incorporation and there are indeed only
a few instances that could be interpreted as such. In comparison to the more common
nominal compounding, noun incorporation appears to be exceptional. What may be
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                                     143
said of Uchumataqu noun incorporation is that in most cases a direct objet is
incorporated into a (transitive) action-process verb and the resulting compounds are
verbs or nouns. The few instances of noun incorporation suggest that they are
exocentric (e.g. 39 and 40), in contrast to nominal compounding, which is mainly
endocentric. Word order is OV in all but one case. Since the number of possible
instances is limited, nothing can be said about particular semantic fields where noun
incorporation occurs.
(39)       awari fax-ta-cay
           soul hide-RES-DEC
           'grave (lit.: 'hidden soul')'                            (Vellard 1951:8)
(40)        tapa-xalm
           pepper-grind
           'mortar'                                                 (Métraux 1935:101)
Example (41) shows an instance where the resulting compound is a verb.
(41)       tusi     kat-sam
           heart loose-?
           'unable to remember (lit.: 'heart lost')'                (Velard 1951:35)
There is also a synthetic expression for 'unable to remember', which is kata-ni-cay
'to forget'(Vellard 1951:35).
     The following example is in two ways outstanding. First, it is the only example
where a subject is incorporated into an intransitive motion verb, and second, we find
a reversed order of verb and subject.
(42)       picfaj hos-sa306
           come mountain
           'smallpox'                                               (Vellard 1951:22)
In sum, I would like to conclude that noun incorporation does not seem to be a
regular means of deriving new lexical items in Uchumataqu. Whereas nominal
compounding is used frequently, noun incorporation appears to be rather occasional
and limited to a few items only. It is possible that this restriction is in part due to the
more regular use of chain verb constructions or that Uchumataqu syntactic structure
already resembles noun incorporation by not marking a direct object, which in most
cases is immediately followed by the verbal predicate. It is unlikely that the lack of
noun incorporation is due to language attrition since nominal compounding is
testified for every source.","[159, 160]"
"7.8.3 Adverbial clauses
In what follows, I will discuss adverbial clauses, which ""modify a verb phrase or a
whole clause. [...] The kinds of information embodied in adverbial clauses are the
same kinds of information expressed by adverbs, [...]."" Payne (1997:316f). On this
basis, five types of adverbial clauses can be established for Uchumataqu:      Clause type                 Marker
      time                        -na
      simultaneous                -ku
      conditional                 -(t)xani
      manner                      -ni
      purpose                     -xapa
      Table 7.1 : Adverbial clauses in UchumataquFollowing Thompson and Longacre (1985:172) I will discuss as typical devices of
adverbial subordinate clauses: ""(a) subordinating morphemes (b) special verb forms
(c) word order"".
     The following statements are valid for all types of Uchumataqu adverbial
clauses. Both the matrix as well as the adverbial clause show an unmarked
declarative word order in principle, i.e. SOV (although rather exceptionally), SV, or
OV. This is possible since there is an overt marker signaling the adverbial function of
an expression inflected with any of the markers shown in table 7.1. The use of   The authors (1985 177) also divide adverbial clauses into those that can be substituted for by a single
word and those that cannot. This criterion is impossible to verify for Uchumataqu due to the condition of
the data. Thus, these two subgroups will not be part of the following discussion.
290                         UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
declarative -cay on an adverbial expression or clause is clearly prohibited and all
TAM markers occur on the matrix verb. However, the adverbial clauses have a stong
tendency to consist of the adverbial expression alone and are thus not accompanied
by further constituents. The adverbial clause either precedes or follows its matrix
clause although there is a tendency for the adverbial clause to precede it. This is
slightly different with both subject relativiser -ni and purpose -xapa. Adverbial
expressions or clauses built with them tend to occur at the periphery of a clause,
although subject relativiser -ni also often immediately precedes the verb or verb
phrase it modifies. Adverbial clauses built with purpose marking -xapa follow the
matrix clause rather than precede it. In the following sections, definitions and
examples of each adverbial clause type are provided. If a clause type displays a
particular feature, it will be treated in the given section.","[306, 307]"
"3.4.1 Nominal compounding
Accordig to Bauer (2006:719), ""[a] compound is usually defined [...] as a word that is
made up of two other words.""289. As elaborated in the literature, it is somewhat
problematic to distinguish compounds from phrases, since both are the result of
combining independent items into larger, meaningful units (cf. Anderson 1985:40).
Several criteria help to identify compounds, including phonological peculiarities and
particularly the stress pattern, but as outlined in chapter 2, these measures are less
reliable for Uchumataqu. However, morphophonological processes, such as the use
of linking elements or elision of the final vowel may indicate whether an item is
perceived as one word or two. Linking elements often indicate clearly that the object
is indeed a compound, but elision of final vowels is frequent in Uchumataqu and
therefore can never be the single criterion for establishing compounds. With respect
to morphology, we find that inflection occurs only on the last element of a compound
(cf. Bauer 2006:723) and thus, an item such as kot' suni-naka 'the Uru people'
(Vellard 1967:3) can be interpreted as a compound290. Another means of establishing
  Anderson (1985 40) points out that a compound can consist of more than two words.
  Please note that this claim receives additional support by the elision of final /a/ on kola 'lake'.
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                                   139
compounds is their syntactic behaviour, i.e. since compounds form a single part of
speech, they syntactically behave as any other member of this class and occupy an
appropriate position (e.g. clause initial in case the compound is a noun functioning as
a subject). As will be shown with greater detail in chapter 7, Uchumataqu has a
relatively free word order, and although it is in principle SOV, nearly every word
order is possible and thus, the position an item can take does not provide much
evidence. However, if an item occurs repeatedly as a unit in the sources and its
components are never split up by other constitutents (as is the case with kot ' sum),
then it is likely to be a compound. The last criteria to be mentioned are semantic: the
""degree of lexicalised meaning"" and the ""degree of compositionality"" (Anderson
1985:44). The meaning of a compound is often more than the sum of its parts and
lexicalised. Consider (28):(28)       p-cincu     kara
           bird        hand
           'wing'                                                (Lehmann 1929b: 1)
In establishing compounds on a semantic base, I interpret those items as compounds
that occur with some frequency in the sources291 and / or whose meaning is non-
compositional. This is not without obstacles, either: an item still documented in e.g.
Uhle (1894) may be already lost in e.g. Métraux (1935) although it was lexicalised.
In some cases, the sources offer divergent translations for the same item, which can
make the status of the item in question doubtful. In other cases, the appearance of an
object is that of a compound but with respect to semantics, a lexicalised meaning is
less likely, as demonstrated in example (29).
(29)       tuxsfaj kuya-cay
           foreign house-DEC
           'it is a house of others; an Aymara house292 (Vellard 1967:7)
Example (29) shows an object which at first sight could be understood as a
compound since two words follow each other immediately and inflection (i.e.
declarative -cay) occurs on the second component. However, with respect to
frequency of use, it is less likely that an expression such as this would have become
lexicalised and furthermore, it is compositional and thus, instances such as example
(29) are not regarded as compounds293.1 would like to point out that for establishing
compounds I rely mainly on semantic criteria, which can be supported by
morphophonological, morphological, and syntactic findings.
     Uchumataqu makes frequent use of compounding, particularly with kinship
terms and body parts. Uchumataqu compounds can be understood as consisting of a
head and its modifier, the head being nominal whereas the modifier can be another
noun, an adjective, or an adverb. The order is modifier-head. Consider (30) to (32):
2,1
   Which points to their lexicalised status.
292
   tuxsa means 'foreign' but is mainly used to denote the Aymara people.
293
   Another semantic test for the compound status are paraphrases (Anderson 1985 42). However, this
cannot be tested since the sources do not offer periphrastic descriptions (in Uchumataqu) for compounds.

The following is an instance of an adverb functioning as a modifier.

           'cousin'                                                (Métraux 1935:94)
The parts of speech used in Uchumataqu compounds are nouns, adjectives, and
adverbs295 and the resulting compounds are either nouns or adjectives. Thus,
Uchumataqu compounds can be sketched as follows296: [N/Adj/Adv-N]N/Adj
     The majority of the resulting compounds is endocentric (see examples 30 to 32),
while only a minor part is exocentric (see examples 33 and 34).
(33)        piskfij-yuku
           two-face
           'cheeks'                                                (Lehmann 1929b: 10)

In all but one case, the components are simply juxtaposed and often, the final vowel
of the modifier is deleted (e.g. example 33). Example (35) is the only instance where
a linking element -/ is used.
(35)        haqe-l-taqe

As will be further discussed in chapter 4, the use of haqeltaqe in Uchumataqu is
uncertain and if it is indeed lexicalised, it possibly originates from Aymara haqe
'person, human being' and take 'totality' (DeLucca 1983:161, 397). If this analysis is
true, then the Uchumataqu speakers borrowed both components from Aymara,
'glued' them together by means of linking element -/, and derived a new meaning for
the resulting item.
     Apart from this, there are cases which seem to be compounds but one of their
components does not occur independently (cf. Payne 1997:93f)· Therefore, its2.4
    The hyphe in lussi 'leg' does not mark a morpheme boundary but can be interpreted as marking a

meaning and the word class it belongs to remain uncertain. An example is the word
for 'hunger' ceri s-tuk-29* (see tab. 3.3). It appears in all sources, is completely
lexicalised, and translations agree on that it means 'hunger; to be hungry'. The first
component is known as ceri 'stomach' but tuk does not occur as an independent
lexical item299. It is even doubtful whether ceri s-tuk- (regardless of the spelling) can
be considered a compound since the element -s (or *-) is reminiscent of third person
clitic - j , which always occurs word initially or finally. If this is true, then the
expression for 'hunger' consists of two lexical items.","[155, 156, 157, 158]"
"1.1 Structural overview of the Uchumataqu language
Together with closely related Chipaya (cf. 1.1.2), Uchumataqu forms the language
family of Uru-Chipaya, which is assumed to be isolated (cf. Torero 2002:466,
Muysken 2001:76). The following summary of the linguistic structure of
Uchumataqu is based on my research and the features addressed here will be further
outlined in chapters 2 to 7.
       Uchumataqu phonology differs in some aspects from that of the neighbouring
Aymara and Quechua languages. Just like these languages Uchumataqu has a rather
elaborate set of plosives. However, these include aspirated, glottalised, and labialised
plosives, and word initial plosive clusters, something that cannot be observed for
Quechua or Aymara. Furthermore, Uchumataqu has some affricates and fricatives,
which do not occur in its neighbouring languages, either, such as dental voiceless
affricate /ts/ or postalveolar voiceless fricative [J]1. Another distinctive feature of
Uchumataqu phonology is the 5-vowel system with a long variant of each vowel.
However, increasing influence of Aymara (with a 3-vowel system) caused the
attrition of the 5-vowel system, as can be observed in later studies on Uchumataqu
(e.g. Vellard 1967). The tendency of Uchumataqu to allow consonant clusters is also
reflected in its syllable structure, where a syllable can have the form of CVCC or
    Which does not have phonemic status.
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                              3
CCVC. However, the most common forms are CV or CVC. With respect to stress we
find that Uchumataqu has a tendency to place stress on the penultimate syllable,
although this is not compulsory and there are exceptions from this, particularly when
a bisyllabic stem is inflected with a bisyllabic suffix or a mono- or bisyllabic verb is
inflected with first person singular markers -u or -a.
      The elision of final vowels (or in some cases the deletion of the last syllable)
does not have morphological meaning in Uchumataqu, i.e. kuy' 'house' does not
denote a direct object or any other grammatical relation, although the full form would
be kuya. I therefore call these processes context-sensitive instead of
morphophonological. The context-sensitive processes comprise mainly final vowel
elision and to a lesser degree elision of consonants. In order to prevent elision, the
dummy elements -i and -u are used. Uchumataqu has a certain tendency towards
metathesis, which occurs with the present tense habitual marker -in that is
metathesised to -ni, related state adjectival marker -tni to -tin, and the locative
markers -kis and -fa/' and their allophones -ski and -siki which are built by metathesis
      Uchumataqu distinguishes three major parts of speech, which are nouns,
adjectives and verbs. There is no morphological device that distinguishes particles as
a separate class and the only particle that occurs frequently is the negation particle
ana 'no, not'. Adverbs can be subsumed under either nouns or adjectives. The latter
are distinguished by the use of predicator -kasi and form an open class in
Uchumataqu. Morphological processes of Uchumataqu are primarily compounding,
only marginally noun incorporation and reduplication. Uchumataqu compounds
consist of a nominal head and a modifier, which can be another noun, an adjective, or
an adverb; the resulting compounds are endocentric or exocentric, although the latter
is exceptional. Compounding is a productive process in Uchumataqu and occurs
mainly with kinship terms and body parts. Noun incorporation, however, is hardly
ever used in Uchumataqu and the few examples found could be analysed differently.
Reduplication is another productive morphological process of Uchumataqu and
occurs with all parts of speech and can be partial or complete. With verbs,
reduplication mainly intensifies the meaning of the verb stem, while reduplicated
adjectives and nouns are augmentative or, in the case of nouns, express plurality.
Reduplication of grammatical material is mainly restricted to possessive marking -ci.
      Although Uchumataqu is an agglutinative language, the average number of
affixes per word is low: nouns and pronouns tend to carry only one affix, while
adjectives and adverbs are often zero marked or have at best one bound morpheme.
This also holds for particles and numerals. Only verbs have a tendency to carry two
morphological morphemes, and verbs with three or four affixes attached are
exceptional. Uchumataqu differs from Aymara and Quechua by the low number of
affixes that occur on a stem.
      Uchumataqu employs mainly suffixes, but it also has two prefixes, one of which
is lexicalised. The case marking system of Uchumataqu resembles that of Aymara
and Quechua with the exception of locative marking devices, where we find the
directional locative -kis (and its metathesised allomorph -ski), locative marker -ksi
(and the allomorph -siki) as well as yet another locative marker -ta. The latter
contrasts with locative -ksi I -siki since the form -ta does not occur with stative or
4                             UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
position verbs or in locational predicate clauses. Uchumataqu has six personal
pronouns, which also occur in possession marking and only for the first person
singular does a specially marked form exist: wist 'my'. However, it is likely that at
least the third person plural pronoun ninaka 'they' has been inspired by Aymara, with
which it shares plural marker -naka. This appears to be a recent development since
sources until Métraux (1935) still report the use of an ancient pronominal plural
marker -wici. Similar considerations could be applied to the pronoun of first person
plural exclusive wisnaka, which is clearly derived from first person singular wir 'Γ
and -naka, although no combination of wir with -wici occurs. Another peculiarity of
Uchumataqu's pronominal system is the form kun, which appears to be the pronoun
of second person singular and is preferrably applied in interrogative clauses, although
it occurs in sentence types too. Its function and meaning is not fully understood.
      Uchumataqu has four postpositions, one of which, kos 'inside', can be inflected
with nominal locative marker -ta.
      As in the majority of South American languages, the verbal system of
Uchumataqu is rather complex, although some of its aspects can be described only
vaguely due to the incomplete sources and the progressive attrition of Uchumataqu
reflected in them. In the verbal system the two prefixes mentioned above can be
observed. The marker s- appears to have been still productive at the time of
documentation and marks a first person singular as object. The second prefix ke-
indicating 'return' had already been lexicalised on kepic- 'return' when Uchumataqu
was documented. However, the use of prefixes is exceptional among the Andean
languages. Uchumataqu has a tense system, which primarily distinguishes future /
non-future, although there are markers for past, present and future tense. Only a first
singular is clearly indicated in present and future tense by the markers -u and -a.
There are no bound morphemes for any other person, with the exception of In-Group
marker -acu referring to first plural inclusive, which, however, may have an aspectual
quality. Only a few aspectual suffixes are found in the sources, probably due to the
circumstances of data collection and the increasing attrition of Uchumataqu. Other
verbal markers are nominalising -ni and -s(i), two subordination markers, of which
only gerund -ku can be satisfactorily interpreted, and irrealis -aca, which fulfills
several functions, such as marking conditional or Deontic modality.
     The general order of verbal affixes is that grammatical function marking affixes,
aspectual suffixes, subordinating and switch reference marking suffixes, the valence
changing suffix as well as nominalising and adjectival state marking suffixes cluster
around the verb stem. These suffixes appear to be mutually exclusive. They can be
followed by the validational suffix -kala, which is a verbal suffix. Mood, modality,
and portmanteau suffixes expressing tense and person are the last verbal suffixes to
be attached. Verbs can take one or two of the clausal clitics -pini, -ki, or -cay2, which
themselves can be followed by one of the personal clitics -/, -tn, or -s.
     On a clausal level, Uchumataqu has the following clitics: declarative -cay, topic
marker -ki, and affirmative -pini3. Another peculiarity of Uchumataqu is the use of
2
    Affirmative -pini and declarative -cay can be combined.

    Which is a more recent loan from Aymara.
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                      5
the personal clitics -/, -m, and -s, which refer to first, second, and third person,
respectively. Although their usage in the sources appears to be mainly emphatic,
there are also hints that these clitics had a person marking function in a more intact
stage of Uchumataqu. This is particularly reflected in interrogative and imperative
clauses. Uchumataqu is predominantly an SOV language but it allows great variation
with respect to word order. Interrogative devices are the interrogative pronouns and
the use of question markers -ta and -xwi; the latter is an allomorph of topic marker -ki
used in questions. In most cases, declarative -cay does not occur in interrogative
clauses, although there are some yes / no questions in which it is used. Although the
number of relative clauses is severely limited in my data, it appears that they are built
with nominalising subject relativiser -ni and are prenominai in nature, corresponding
to the basic SOV word order. The available examples suggest that relativisation in
Uchumataqu is restricted to subjects.","[19, 20, 21, 22]"

7.4 Declarative clauses
In general, declarative clauses ""convey assertions, expressions of belief, reports,
conclusions, narratives, assessment of likelihood, expressions of doubt [...]."" (Sadock
and Zwicky 1985:165). On the basis of this definition I subsume under the heading of
declarative every clause that carries the declarative marker -cay. This includes
clauses in the past, present, and future tense as well as clauses built with irrealis -aca
(cf. 5.8.2; with the exception of the Optative). In contrast to imperative or
interrogative clauses, declarative clauses express the highest degree of certainty on
the speaker's side, even though they can be marked with irrealis -aca622.
      Following Sadock's and Zwicky's categorisation, Uchumataqu could potentially
be a marked declarative language due to its suffix -cay. However, I consider it to be a
language with unmarked declaratives since the word order in declarative clauses
serves as the basis for other deviating clause types, such as e.g. interrogatives or
imperatives (cf. Sadock and Zwicky 1985:165).
      Although Uchumataqu is relatively free with respect to this623, its basic word
order is SOV (Uhle 1894:12b, Torero 2002:477).
(30)       ni-ki      cins(i) pa-cay
           (s)he-TOP mat make-DEC
           '(S)he makes a mat.'                                (Uhle 1894:14a)
An indirect complement often precedes the direct complement, as shown in (31) (cf.
7.8.2).
(31)       wir-i-l       tu:s-wintanf2A tek'kus na-cay
           I-LV-CL=1 balsa_ raft-into stick            put-DEC
           'I put the stick [to push the raft] into the balsa raft'
           (Vellard 1967:28)
Apart from these, two other very common sequences are SV and OV. SV does not
only occur in intransitive clauses (32) but also in transitive clauses when the object is
solely encoded in the verb, as in (33).
(32)       haka      pikiltafnj soni pic[a]-aki-cay
           tomorrow thetwo man come-FU-DEC
           'Tomorrow, two men [together] will come.' (Métraux 1935:109)
(33)       wir-l-i    pek-s-n-u-cay
           I-CL=1-LV  want-su-OB2-PSTl-DEC
           'I demanded it.'                                    (Vellard 1951:34)
The sequence OV occurs when the subject is either not expressed at all625 or when it
is encoded in the verb, as e.g. in present (34) and future tense, or by In-Group Marker
-acu (35).","[292, 293]"

1 AN INTRODUCTION TO THE UCHUMATAQU LANGUAGE
AND THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDYUchumataqu, also known as Uru, was spoken around Lake Titicaca in the
communities of Irohito (northwestern Bolivia), Ch'imu (southeastern Peru), and in
the Bay of Puno (Peru) It is assumed that in pre-colomal times there has been an
Uru-speaking population all along the nvers of the Bolivian Altipiano and at the great
lakes Titicaca, Ροορό and Coipasa Wachtel (1986 283) named this stretch the
""aquatic axis"" Adapting to this environment, the Uru based their economy on
hunting, fishing, and gathering However, it is likely that the Uru already became
dispersed under Inca rule and matters did not improve for the Uru population when
the Spanish arrived In fact, they were forced to leave their traditional communities,
abandon their lifestyle and settle down in Aymara villages By this process, the
community of Irohito became isolated and what could be called one of 'the last
stands' of Uru culture and language Despite less favourable social, economic, and
political circumstances, the small village of Irohito managed to survive and even
maintained its language Uchumataqu Although the Uru, their particular culture and
language had been known since early colonial times, they were not documented
before 1894, when Max Uhle paid a visit to Irohito and for the first time collected
linguistic data Irohito soon became a kind of scientific hot spot (Muysken m s
2007 4) and during the first half of the 20th century, the village was visited by a
number of researchers, who recorded Uchumataqu However, a severe drought at the
beginning of the 1940's brought the end to Irohito, and Uchumataqu became extinct
around 1950 However, Irohito recovered and survived as a settlement Today, there
is a certain pnde of the inhabitants about their distinct culture Although the language
has been extinct for about half a century by now and only the knowledge of some
words and phrases remains, the Uru are aware of their ancient language, which, still,
contnbutes to the Urns' view of themselves as being different from all their
neighbours
      This study is based on the efforts and results of the early researchers, who
worked in Irohito and on Uchumataqu between 1894 and 1967 Although a
considerable amount of research had been conducted during this time, only few
studies were actually published and none brought together what had been said on
Uchumataqu Therefore, the aim of this book is to provide a grammatical description
of Uchumataqu, taking into consideration every study, published or unpublished, that
is concerned with linguistic data on Uchumataqu It seeks to give an impression of
this language and its phonological, morphological, and syntactic processes and to
provide linguists from different backgrounds with a reference grammar on this so far
minimally described language Working with (in part) historic material on a language
that is not acquired by anyone any more as native language involves a certain degree
of reconstruction and makes necessary more assumptions and incertainties than
would have been the case with a language that is still spoken However, this study is
not a reconstruction in the sense that it tries to reconstruct a proto-language or the
kind of Uchumataqu that was spoken 500 years ago Rather, its purpose is to describe
the language as it has been recorded during the last 50 years of its existence and is
2                            UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
thus a description of a highly endangered language, which, became extinct two
generations ago. It cannot be denied that material from different researchers with
different backgrounds and recorded at different stages of the language, adds new
problems to the already existing challenge of describing a dying language. Thus, in
some cases our knowledge of certain phenomena remains limited since the data do
not provide solutions and there are no native speakers left to answer questions.
      To give a more detailed outline of Uchumataqu, its speakers and the research on
which the present study is based, this chapter will sketch the structure of Uchumataqu
and its differences and similarities with closely related Chipaya, before giving an
overview of the Spanish, Quechua, and Aymara influences on this language. That
will be followed by a description of the history of Irohito, its development during the
20th century, and its position at the beginning of the 21 st century, including a sketch
on the field-work I conducted in Irohito. Before turning to detailed presentation of
the sources considered here, I will comment on the theoretical framework applied for
the current study and the resulting terminology and methodology.
      This introductory chapter will be followed by a description of the phonology of
Uchumataqu and its morphophonological processes in chapter 2, which I call
context-sensitive processes. Chapter 3 describes the morphological patterns that can
be observed in Uchumataqu. Then I turn to a description of the nominal system in
chapter 4. Chapter 5 concerns a presentation of the verbal system of Uchumataqu.
The following chapter 6 deals with adverbs, postpositions, and the negation particle
ana. The final chapter of this book provides a description of the clause types and
syntactic operations of Uchumataqu. The appendices contain a comparative
dictionary and transcriptions of Uhle's and Lehmann's manuscripts of Uchumataqu.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                     135
Uchumataqu affixes can be characterised by the so-called ""relevance principle"", as
presented by Bybee (1985:15f): ""[...] semantic elements that are highly relevant to
one another are likely to be packaged together and expressed lexically, or will be the
most common inflectional or derivational categories."". That is, categories that are
generally thought of as most relevant, such as tense, aspect, mood, number, and case
are expressed in Uchumataqu as either derivational or inflectional (bound)
morphemes.
      For the distinction between derivation and inflection, I would like to follow
Booij (2006:654, 656): ""The distinction between inflection and derivation is
primarily a functional one: it refers to different functions of morphological processes,
the creation of different forms of lexemes versus the creation of different lexemes."",
and further ""[...] derivation may change the syntactic category of its input forms,
whereas inflection is always category-neutral. [...] [I]nflection creates forms of the
same lexeme, unlike derivation, which determines the lexical category of the lexemes
it creates."". Thus, by derivation I understand that the application of a grammatical,
bound morpheme can change the syntactic category of its host. Inflectional affixes do
not have this ability.
      Based on this definition, I view action nominaliser -s(i), subject relativiser -ni,
related State marking -tni (and its allomorph -tin) as well as causative -sna (and its
allomorph -ska) to be derivational. The following examples demonstrate their usage.
      Both action nominaliser -s(i) and subject relativiser -ni nominalise a verb stem
and these suffixes thus match the criterion for derivational affixes. Please consider
examples (21) and (22).
(21)       pot-si
           cut-AN
           'a knife (lit: 'that which is for cutting')'             (Uhle 1894:64)
(22)       sis-ni-ki
           know-SR-TOP
           'a sorcerer (lit.: 'the one who knows')'                (Métraux 1935:96)
                                                     2U
The application of State marking -tni I -tin to verbs produces adjectives (cf. 4.3.5)
and thus, both these markers are considered derivational (see examples 23 and 24).(23)       lik-tni
           drink-ST
           'drunk (lit.: 'the one who drank')'                     (Métraux 1935:99)
(24)       tiks-tni
           die-ST

136                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
The causative marker -sna and its allomorph -ska do not change word class, since a
verb stem to which -sna (or -ska) is attached remains a verb. However, attaching the
causative morpheme has syntactic and semantic implications, as expressed by Booij
(2006:656): ""[...] the derivation of causative verbs leads to the creation of transitive
verbs that indicate the obligatory presence of a direct object [...]. Hence, the
derivation of causative verbs has syntactic relevance."". Apart from this syntactic
impact, derivation of causative verbs often leads to a semantic difference, which
sometimes results in lexical causatives, such as e.g. 'to eat' and 'cause somebody to
eat = to feed'. The Uchumataqu causative fits into this scheme, since it introduces a
new participant286 and produces new lexical items.
(25)        cis-                  'to speak'
            cis-[s]na             'to cause someone to speak = to teach someone'
                                                            (Métraux 1935:103,96)
(26)        kaxa                  'debt'
            pkaxsna-cay           'to cause somebody to be indebted = to lend'
                                                            (Uhle 1894:100)
Example (27) presents a lexical causative:
(27)        tiks-     'to die'          kona- 'to kill'              (Métraux 1935:101, 108)
Another possible example of a lexical causative is the verb skata- 'to send' (Vellard
1967:9), which could have been constructed of causative -ska and the verb ta: 'to
give', meaning 'to cause somebody to give = to send'. Problematic is that the
potential causative form precedes the verb stem, which otherwise must not be the
case. If skata- has indeed been derived this way, we may assume that it has been
completely lexicalised at the time of documentation. Since further examples are
missing, this has to remain speculative.
     In sum, the majority of Uchumataqu affixes is inflectional and only the forms
discussed above are considered derivational.
     With respect to the order of affixes, ""[i]t is often observed that derivational
morphemes occur closer to the root to which they attach than inflectional morphemes
do"" (Bybee 1985:33). In Uchumataqu, we find that on nouns and pronouns the plural
marker precedes case suffixes, which themselves can be followed by clausal clitics.
This observation is in accordance with Bybee's findings (1985:34)287. In most cases,
adjectives and adverbs are zero marked. However, if they take markers, we find a
situation similar to nouns, i.e. case markers (on adverbs) or predicator -kasi (on both
categories) are attached directly to the stem and can be followed by clausal clitics.
Only verbs tend to have a higher number of affixes, although it rarely exceeds two
affixes per verb stem. This limitation makes it somewhat difficult to determine the
position an affix can take, i.e. although it may be attached directly to the stem, it is    The form -sna occurs with (transitive) cognition (e.g. sis- 'to know') and utterance verbs (e.g. cis- 'to
speak') as well as with (intransitive) states, which then become transitive. Its allomorph -ska appears only
with (transitive) action and action-process verbs (e.g cer- 'to see, look at' and kos- 'to break')
286
    Thus, changing an intransitive into a transitive or a transitive into a ditransitive verb
2,7
    Referring to Greenberg ( 1963 112).

possible that it is preceded by a number of empty slots. Some morpheme
combinations never occur, although in theory they could and therefore, it remains
likewise uncertain whether these morphemes occupy the same slot or different ones.
However, despite these restrictions I propose the following order of verbal
morphemes in Uchumataqu, but it is tentative, and the position of some affixes can
only be assumed.","[151, 152, 153, 154]"

However, Uchumataqu has a rather free word order and nearly all sequences can
occur, although the language has a very strong tendency to place the verb at the end
of a clause. Example (36) shows a marked word order. We may assume that any
word order distinct from the three most common sequences presented above is
marked for reasons of emphasis and / or stress. No increased Spanish influence on
Uchumataqu word order can be established, given also the low level of Uchumataqu-
Spanish bilingualism among the last Uchumataqu speakers.

            'Into nothing I could interfere.'                        (Vellard 1967:8)
Although not common, a clause may consist of a verbal predicate alone (cf. 7.8.1).
(37)        kepit-cay629
            retum-DEC
            'He returned.'                                           (Vellard 1949:160)7.5 Imperative clauses
Imperatives differ from declarative clauses with respect to morphological marking
and, to a certain degree, word order. Imperative marking is: -a or its allomorph -ay
for second person, -x marks an indirect command, while -la expresses an exhortative
and was replaced by cuki V-ki in a later stage of the language (cf. 5.8.1). Declarative
-cay is not used in imperative clauses since it expresses a proposition not yet fulfilled
and whose fulfillment is dependent on the willingness of a person other than the
speaker's (except in exhortative clauses). Most imperative clauses consist only of a
verbal predicate (38), which can be accompanied by manner adverbs (39).

Another common clause structure is OV, as in (40).

           'Let's make a net.'                                     (Vellard 1951:32)
In some cases, the subject is mentioned explicitly, as with the form of cuki V-ki
where the personal pronoun is obligatory. When used with persons other than this, we
may assume that it has an emphatic value, as in e.g. English 'You go!'.
(41)        awariskiya pikitka lul-ay
            bread        thetwo eat-lMP
            'Eat the bread, the two of you!'                       (Vellard 1967:11)

            give (you).'
            ('Nosotros trabajaremos [...].')             (Vellard 1967:5)
As demonstrated in (42), imperative clauses may be elaborate and can include direct
and indirect complements. Among these more elaborate clauses, the word orders of
SOV and OSV are the most common ones, although they form only a small part of
the imperative clauses accounted for. Example (41) shows the marked word order of
OSV and the emphatic value is reflected in the translation. Since Uchumataqu is
rather free in its word order, other combinations appear as well but are exceptional.","[293, 294, 295]"

           'The son of the hilacata goes to kill ducks.'                        (Métraux 1935:90)
The word order of complement clauses is SOV, OV, or SV with the complement
preceding the matrix verb. If there is an indirect complement, it often precedes the
direct complement, as in (87) and (88).
(87)        wir-i-l        hase-kasi
                                   q'a: ta.-s    pek-u-cay

            'I now want to give money.'                     (Uhle 1894:94.2)
(88)        ni suni wir-sta[n]-k[i] ok pek-cay
            that man I-COM-TOP          go want-DEC
            'That man wants to go with me.'                                     (Vellard 1967:16)
However, variation in word order is possible (89) although it occurs more often with
the chain verb construction. In somes cases, other constituents can appear between
the complements and its matrix verb (90).
(89)        wir-l-i      sisa pek-u-cay       kot sunfij-s tako
            I-CL=1-LV    speak want-lSG-DECUru-GEN         word
            'I want to speak the Urus' language.'                               (Vellard 1951:35)
(90)        gay   kui-kina-kfi]    pitci-cay
            trade house-DiR-τορ come-DEC
            'We come to the trade house [= store].'                             (Vellard 1949:152)
It can be argued that the following case forms a subcategory of the chain verb
construction. What is striking is that the matrix verb behaves like the complement
and vice versa, i.e. the matrix verb (which is always pek- 'to want') is unmarked and
precedes the complement which bears person, tense / aspect marking, and declarative
-cay. However, the translation suggests a normal complement clause interpretation.
(91)        yas pek      hes-n-a-cay        hap'pay

            'I will want to rest [myself]657, o father.'                        (Vellard 1967:9)
According to Payne (1997:233), this construction may be a verb-verb compound
which he defines as follows: ""[...] both roots are recognizable verbs in their own
right, but nothing can come in between them, and the meaning of the whole structure
is 'bleached', i.e., slightly different from the combination of the lexical meanings of
the two roots [...]."" (marking by the author). Although the database on this
phenomenon is limited, the first two requirements can be regarded as fulfilled, i.e.
both roots are verbs in their own rights and their combination is not split up by other
components. With respect to the last requirement, we have to rely on the translations656
   Métraux added in parentheses 'wiéi sus""1' Since the nature of this comment is uncertain, it is not dealt
with here
*"" Since 'to rest' is an intransitive verb, object marker -« may suggest a reflexive meaning here
CHAPTER 7 - CLAUSES                                                                                    289
offered in the sources which do not suggest a change of meaning. Thus, within this
possible compound, the verb forms are not translated any different from a
complement-verb construction. Thus, constructions as in (91) stand somewhere in
between complements and verb-verb compounds and I view them as a subcategory of
the chain verb constructions.
      Finally, I would like to add a note concerning the difference between
complements marked by action nominaliser -s(i) and chain verb constructions. Both
means show a certain similarity in that they are used for complementation and almost
always occur with pek- 'to want' as the matrix verb. Thus, the question of their
difference in meaning arises. Since the database is not extensive and for most cases,
we lack a context, the following has to be regarded as speculative. We may assume
that the missing marking of complement verbs in chain verb constructions conveys
the idea of a greater semantic integration into the matrix than is the case with -s(i)-
marked complements and it may be possible that zero marked verbs then denote a
permanent or long-standing wish or desire in contrast to complements inflected with
the action nominaliser. If this assumption is correct, then e.g. (84) could be
understood as a permanent refusal to drink, i.e. the person never drinks, while e.g.
(87) denotes a momentary wish. This hypothesis is further supported by the use of the
temporal adverb hase 'now' in (87).","[304, 305, 306]"

    The proposal made by Payne is in accordance with Schachter (19853), who proposes a classification of
word classes in general on the basis of distributional and morphosyntactic features 1 would like to point
out that Payne uses the term ""distributional"" instead of 'functional', which is employed by me in order to
cover morphological peculiarities as well.

However, particularly adverbs of time can function as topics, too, although they tend
to be presentational topics (see 7 2 2), as demonstrated in example (81 )

Thus, with respect to their functional properties, nouns can be set apart from other
grammatical categones by their ability to be the head of noun phrases, to function as
the subject of a clause, and to be topics of texts However, in terms of their use as
predicates and objects, they show some overlap with the class of verbs
      As structural properties of nouns Payne (1997 35) lists the ""possibility of taking
descriptive modifiers [ ] and the use of genitive case pronouns"" With respect to the
first requirement, we find that verbs, too, can take descriptive modifiers in the form
of adverbs However, the range of modifiers that refer to nouns is broader than that
refenng to verbs That is, nouns can be modified by other nouns (82), by adjectives
(77), and numerals (83) Verbs can be modified only by adverbs that express manner
or degree(82)       tar[a] cxa la

Marking with possessive pronouns as a criterion to classify nouns can be applied with
respect to the possessive pronoun of first person singular, expressed as wist 'my'

           my house-sep      come-dec
           'I come from my house '                       (Vellard 1967 17)
With respect to the remaining possessive pronouns of second person singular to third
person plural, however, no such distinction is made, ι e personal and possessive
pronouns are expressed by the same form This is the case in examples (85) and (86),
in which the same form am 'you' is used to refer to the noun qoya 'house' in example
(85) and to ok- 'to go' which describes an action, ι e a verb (86)

           you go hunt-SR
           'you (sg) go hunting (lit.: 'you go as a hunter')' (Uhle 1894:94.1)
Although not mentioned by Payne as another structural property, I would like to
point to the capacity of nouns to be marked for case and number (example 87).
(87)       soni-naka-kina
            man-PL-DlR
            'to / towards the men'                                       (Uhle 1894:17)
It has to be noted that the case and number marking function of nouns is not a
universal property of nouns. In Uchumataqu, however, this function sets nouns
clearly apart from the word classes of verbs and adjectives, which cannot be marked
for either. However, if the criterion of case marking is considered, we find that
adverbs of time, direction, and location can be marked for case as well, as in:
(88)         sies-kfisjtani
            yesterday-SEP
            'since yesterday.'                                           (Uhle 1894:23,49)
In most cases, however, adverbs are zero marked (cf. 3.2) and furthermore, they lack
characteristics prototypical nouns possess, i.e. adverbs do not usually function as the
head of phrases319, nor can they be subject or object of a clause. An adverb can be
modified by another adverb, but these cases are rare. That is, although adverbs of
time, direction, and location share some structural properties with nouns, they lack
most of the functional characteristics of nouns. However, based on the morphological
behaviour of adverbs, i.e. their ability to take nominal case markers, I classify them
as a subcategory of nouns320. For further discussion on adverbs, cf. chapter 6.
      In conclusion, what sets Uchumataqu nouns apart from other grammatical
categories is their ability to function as the head of noun phrases, topics of texts, and
subjects of clauses. Furthermore, they take a broad range of modifiers and can be
characterised by the application of the distinctive possessive pronoun of first person
singular wist 'my'. However, nouns can be used as predicates without distinctive
marking and thus, occupy a role usually reserved for verbs. In sum, nouns in
Uchumataqu can be classified on the basis of some criteria but the distinction
between them and other parts-of-speech, particularly verbs, is not clear-cut in every
aspect.","[167, 168, 169]"
"3.5.2 Adjectival and adverbial reduplication
In most cases, adjectives reduplicate only their initial syllable and reduplication of
the entire stem (or root) is exceptional.
(54)      cu-cuni
          RED-good
          'very good'                                   (Vellard 1951:10)
(55)      ana    cu-cuni
          NEG RED-good
          'disgusting'                                  (Polo 1901:470)
Example (56) shows the reduplication of the entire (admittedly monosyllabic)
adjectival stem.
(56)      ca-ca-cay
          old-old-DEC
          'very old man'                                (Vellard 1950:60)
The function of adjectival reduplication is always augmentative regardless of whether
there is partial or, less common complete reduplication.
     There is only one instance of adverbial reduplication present in the sources. It is
lexicalised; no basic, non-reduplicated form can be found. Example (57)
demonstrates this instance, with the entire stem reduplicated.
(57)      loaloa
          'quickly'                                     (Métraux 1935:110)3.5.3 Nominal and pronominal reduplication
Nouns and pronouns show the broadest range of reduplication types and functions.
Particularly nouns can reduplicate their initial or final syllable or the enire stem, and
functions most commonly expressed are either augmentative or plurality. The latter
can be expressed only in case the entire nominal stem is reduplicated. This may be
due to the fact that partial reduplication is insufficient in conveying the idea of
plurality and instead, the entire stem must be reduplicated. There are no such
constraints with an augmentative function, which can occur with partial and complete
nominal reduplication. The following examples show the types of reduplication and
functions found with nouns and pronouns.
     Examples (58) and (59) demonstrate the reduplication of initial and final
syllables. For none of the items basic, non-reduplicated forms can be established and
thus, the impact of reduplication cannot be established.

The following is the only instance where an initial consonant cluster is reduplicated.
As in the preceding two examples, the function of reduplication is unknown and the
term is possibly lexicalised.

Example (61) presents an instance where the initial syllable is reduplicated with an
augmentative function. The same meaning is expressed in example (62) with the
entire stem reduplicated.

              'little girl (less than three years)'                 (Vellard 1950:60)
Example (63) shows the augmentative function of pronominal reduplication.

It is only with pronouns that a possible distributive function may be expressed, as in
(64) and (65). There are only a few instances.

As mentioned above, plurality is conveyed only in case the entire stem is
reduplicated as shown in the following example.

Names of astronomical constellations can be regarded as lexicalised In cases such as
these, reduplication has the function of expressing plurality

A similar situation is found with animal names, which are often built by reduplication
of either the initial syllable or the entire stem As with astronomical phenomena, we
may consider them lexicalised
(69)          kusi-kusi-cay
              'it is a spider'                                           (Vellard 1950 87)

In some cases, reduplication serves an onomatopoetic effect
(71)          ko ko ro ko™
              'rooster'                                                  (Lehmann 1929d 8)

Another special case is the reduplication of grammatical material It affects nouns,
adjectives, and numerals and occurs only with possessive marking -ci It is unlikely
that reduplication of possessive -ci is lexicalised since every word bearing
reduplicated -ci has a basic, non-reduplicated form Furthermore, reduplication of -ci
is exceptional since in the majority of all cases, the marker is not reduplicated Thus,
the function of this reduplication type is not entirely clear but it is possible that it
denotes a very close and possibly inalienable kind of possession If this assumption is
true, reduplication of -ci could be considered to be augmentative in function
Consider the following examples
(73)          kurs-ci-ci
              tail-POS-POS
              'rabbit (ht tail-having)'                                   (Lehmann 1929d 5)

CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                  149
Reduplication of possessive -ci is not restricted to body parts but can also occur with
adjectives describing characteristics and numerals
(75)     tuk[i]-ci-ci

         'thirteen'                                    (Vellard 1951 18)
The interpretation of reduplicated -ci as marking a very close relation is further
supported by its use on numerals (cf 4 4) Vellard (1951 17ff) reports the
reduplication to appear on every numeral higher than ten (cf example 76)
In conclusion, I would like to state that reduplication must have been a fairly
productive means of stem modification once, but lexicalisation has often obscured its
meaning This is particularly the case with verbs However, with adjectives, nouns,
and pronouns some regularities can be detected Adjectives mainly reduplicate their
initial syllable and due to their semantics convey only an augmentative meaning,
whereas nouns and pronouns show partial or complete reduplication In contrast to
adjectives, nominal reduplication can have the function of plurality but only with
complete reduplication3 6 Parts of speech
According to Payne (1997 32, bold marking by the author), ""grammatical
categories are called 'parts of speech'"" or are sometimes also referred to as ""lexical
categones"" The lexical content of an Uchumataqu word is sometimes hard to grasp
due to diverging or even missing translations Therefore, I will classify Uchumataqu
categones primarily on the basis of their structural and functional properties, ι e
according to their morphosynatctic behaviour Pursuing this approach the following
parts of speech can be established nouns, adjectives, and verbs Two somewhat
special cases are particles and so-called phrases, ι e fixed expressions found in
everyday life's communication Particles do not form a word class of their own but
do not belong to another word class either Phrases, even less than particles, do not
form a grammatical category but will be treated here as a final remark on
Uchumataqu parts of speech They differ syntactically from prototypical noun or verb
phrases and clause types and thus will not be considered in chapter 7
      Although it is well possible to establish three grammatical categories the
boundanes between them are not always clear-cut (cf Schachter 1985 6, Payne
1997 32) These overlaps are observed for other languages too and go as far as to
bring into question the traditional distinction between the different categories (cf
Croft 2003 183)
      In what follows, I will use the terms 'grammatical category' and 'parts of
speech' alike to refer to the Uchumataqu categones Further, I would like to point out
that for the subsequent outline of the classification of Uchumataqu parts of speech, I
roughly follow Schachter (1985) and Payne (1997)
150                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
3.6.1 Nouns
Notions most typically associated with nouns are time-stability (Payne 1997:33) and
referentiality (Croft 2003:185) to ""persons, places, and things"" (Schachter 1985:7),
the latter concepts considered to be prototypically encoded by nouns.
Payne (1997:33)3'5 lists as functional properties of nouns their ability to act as the
head of noun phrases, to serve as either subject or object of a clause, and to be most
commonly the topic of texts. The head of a noun phrase can be characterised as ""the
one word within the phrase that refers to the same entity that the whole phrase refers
to"" (Payne 1997:33) (cf. 77).
(77)       co:k lu.si
           big    jar
           'abigjar'                                              (Métraux 1935:94)
Example (77) is about ajar, not about co.k 'big', which only specifies the type of jar.
That is, the phrase itself refers to lu.si 'jar', but not to co.k and therefore, lu.si is the
head of the phrase.
     Another function of nouns is as predicates and as such, no particular marking or
copulative device is required. Please consider (78).
(78)       paya           koya-cay
           adobebrick house-DEC
           'This is an αί/oèe-house (= a house made from adobe bricks).'
                                                       (Vellard 1967:7)
The role of a predicate is usually reserved for verbs. When nouns are used as
predicates without particular marking, the distinction between nouns and verbs
becomes blurred316.
      Despite this overlap between verbs and nouns, the latter can be set apart by their
ability to function as the subject of a clause (examples 78 and 79).
(79)        hep-[p]im-s          kuyla manti-cay311
            father-AFF-CL=3 house rule-DEC
            'The father rules [in] the house.'                    (Vellard 1951:35)
The noun hep 'father' is the subject of example (79), whereas kuyla 'house' serves as
object. Thus, these findings are in accordance with Payne's definition. However, with
regard to the role of objects we find an overlap with verbs since verbs can likewise
function as arguments, i.e. objects. These cases will be further discussed in 3.6.3.
     The third functional property of nouns mentioned by Payne is their potential to
be the topics of texts, as demonstrated in example (80a) and (80b). As such, they are
often marked by topic marker -ki (bold).","[163, 164, 165, 166, 167]"

Possessive pronouns can be used in attributive as well as in predicative position In
attributive position word order is possessor-possessive, ι e the possessive pronoun
precedes the possessed

In predicative position the subject precedes the possessive pronoun

           what name-CL=3 your-QTP
           'What is your name''' (lit 'What name is yours 9 ') (Vellard 1951 6)
With regard to nominal suffixes or clausal clitics the morphological marking takes
places on the possessed whereas the possessor (i e the possessive pronoun) is almost
always unmarked4 2 3 Demonstrative Pronouns
In Uchumataqu we find two demonstrative pronouns, which are η and m Although
they occur frequently in the sources, their translation differs and their usage as shown
m the sources does not support a clear interpretation of their difference in meaning
The following interpretation is therefore in part inspired by Chipaya (cf Cerron-
Palomino 2006 102) If we assume that Uchumataqu uses a similar system of
demonstrative pronouns, then the forms /; and m designate different levels of
proximity The element // 'this' marks greater proximity to the speaker whereas m
'that' indicates greater distance from the speaker The system of demonstrative
pronouns is therefore speaker-based and ti and m serve to point to both persons and
objects The form ti may well be connected to the numeral ci 'one' whereas m may
be connected to the personal pronoun of third person singular(83)       ti yo[k] -ksi koka-cer-m-ki           selx-cay

There are two more elements which, according to Uhle, Métraux, and Vellard belong
to the demonstrative system These are naku 'yonder' (Uhle 1894 48 I)410 and an4
   For a more detailed discussion of the double inflection with possessive -a, cf 3 3 5 The word os
'animal' cannot be verified by other sources but occurs repeatedly in Uhle, where it is sometimes spelled
as ox or ax (1894 14a, 64 2, 88 1)

element ta 'this', which according to Métraux (1935) and Vellard (1951, 1967) seems
to express a feminine aspect. If this is true, ta must be seen as a frozen form since
otherwise Uchumataqu does not make a gender distinction.

In attributive position demonstrative pronouns precede the head noun (83, 84)
whereas in non-verbal predicate clauses they follow it (87).

Very often we find a similar word order in interrogative clauses.

            who-GEN house this-TOP
            'Whose house is this?'                                          (Métraux 1935:105)
There are exceptions in that in nominal, pronominal, or adjectival predicate clauses a
demonstrative pronoun can precede its head noun (89) (cf. 4.3.2). However, in the
majority of predicative clauses word order is as indicated in (87).

Demonstrative pronouns hardly ever take morphological markers, although Topic
marker -ki (cf. examples 86-88) is frequently attached to ti and ni occurring in
predicative function. In a few cases comitative-instrumental -stani is attached to ti
and ni.

In what follows, a group of three verbal affixes is presented whose purpose is to
indicate the grammatical functions the verbal arguments fulfil in the clause500. Two
of these markers refer to first person sg and pi (OBl s- and su -s), while the third
marker refers to all other persons (OB2 -n)50]. The object markers, which are OBl s-
and OB2 -n, can be considered obligatory since they occur with transitive verbs that
require a direct complement. The subject marker -s is probably emphatic or
reinforcing rather than strictly obligatory, although this cannot be definitely
established. It is interesting to note that no morpheme is found which marks a person
other than first person as subject. Thus, a first person is prominent over all other
persons in the grammatical function marking system. However, this fits well in with
the overall organisation of Uchumataqu since the language also marks explicitly only
a first person singular in present and future tense tense (by the means of -u and -a,
respectively).
      The following clause shows the interconnections of the clause arguments. Parts
that belong together or refer to each other are in bold or underlined, respectively.

The verbal object marker (OBl) s- is the only prefix that was still productive at the
time Uchumataqu was documented and the productive use of prefixes sets the
language apart from Aymara and Quechua, which do not have such devices. It
constitutes a grammatical function marker since it designates a first person as object.
It is immediately followed by the verb stem (58, 59).
(58)        luli   s-un-n-ai
            food OBl-give-OB2-iMP502
            'Give me food!'                                         (Polo 1901:478)

            'You are a good man, you don't beat me.' (Métraux 1935:92)
As can be seen in examples (58) and (59), object marker s- refers to first person
singular, but there is also one instance in which it marks a first person plural
inclusive as object (60). Since subject marker -s (cf. 5.4.2) serves for both first person    The clitic elements -/, -m, -s can also serve to indicate the subject and object of a clause. For a more
detailed discussion, cf. 7.3.

singular and plural, it is likely that the object marker does the same although in my
data it designates mostly a first person singular.

                                                               (Vellard 1949:166)
Object marker s- appears together with action and action-process verbs since only a
transitive verb can require the marker. This excludes at least motion, position, and
stative verbs (cf. 5.4.3) but it remains uncertain whether the marker could occur with
factive, utterance, cognition, or sensation verbs as e.g. in 'tell me' (61). However, the
following points to the contrary although this may be due to language attrition.
(61)       culu si-si-n-aki         wir-xo
           what tell-tell-OB2-FU I-QTP
           'What will you tell me?'                                 (Vellard 1967:32)
Although object marker Ä- can possibly occur on its own (62), in most cases it is
accompanied by both subject and object (pronouns) (cf. 60, 63) or else person
reference is indicated on the verb, as in (58).
(62)        is-ta-llasm
           OB 1 -give-POL
           '[Please], give me.'                                     (Lehmann 1929d:28)
(63)       am     wir is-ta-lla
           you    I    OB 1-give-POL
           'You (sg) give me [please].'                             (Lehmann 1929d:28)
This leads to the question whether the use of object marker i- has to be considered
obligatory, and hence whether accompanying pronouns or person reference indicated
on the verb are merely emphatic. No hard and firm conclusions can be drawn, but it
is well possible that at a time when Uchumataqu was not yet endangered, object
marker 5- was obligatory since transitive verbs require a direct complement. In this
case, pronouns would have been used only emphatically. Its use as manifest in my
data points to a reinforcing rather than an obligatory status and in later documents
(Vellard 1950-67, Muysken 2005) first person object is marked by either pronouns
(cf. 61) or else context, i.e. OBl s- is not in use any more. However, this may be a
result of language attrition and the growing influence of Spanish. On the basis of
these considerations, I propose that object marker s- was probably once obligatory
but at the time of its documentation has to be considered merely reinforcing. As can
be seen in example (60), object marker s- is not bound to a specific tense.","[242, 243, 244]"
"5.4.3 Object marker -n
The verbal form -n marks the direct object of a clause. Therefore, the marker is
labeled object marker (OB2) but in contrast to object marker s- it marks second
person singular to third person plural as object, although the marker refers to third
person singular mainly. In some cases, the direct object is overtly expressed and the
object marker -n is then redundant, as in (68)507 whereas in other cases it is not, as in
(69).

            I-TOP you look-su-OB2-lSG-DEC NEG you get lost-DEC
            'I am waiting for you; you (sg) are not lost [are you?].'508
                                                          (Vellard 1967:2)

            'I smell [it].'                               (Métraux 1935:107)
As can be seen from the examples, object marker -n is preceded by subject marker s
and followed by person marking suffixes, such as first person singular -u or future
tense marking -a I -aki (cf. 5.4.2). Object marker -n does not appear with motion,
stative, and position verbs (see 5.4.1) but with transitive verbs it occurs without
restriction. Depending on verb semantics it can even designate a reflexive, as in (70).
(70)        wir-i-l         cin-s-n-u-cay
            I-LV-CL= 1      lie_down-su-OB2-1 SG-DEC
            'I lie down.'                                             (Vellard 1951:28)
As demonstrated in (71), with the same verb but a different complement it can mark
transitivity.

            'I lay these clothes down to earth.'   (Métraux 1935:96)
With repect to person reference, we find that the subject is almost always indicated,
either by person marking suffixes in the verb or by the use of pronouns, whereas the
object is hardly ever overtly expressed. This leads to the assumption that object50
   This is one of the few examples where a second person is designated by object marker -n.

marker -n alone is sufficient in order to mark the object, and we may also assume that
it is obligatory, similar to object marker s-. However, there are a few cases in which
the marker -n is not used although one would expect it to appear (cf. example 64). It
is possible that in cases such as (64) object marker -n is considered redundant since
the direct object is expressed overtly (tusa 'balsa raft'). However, in other cases the
non-application of object marker -« may also be ascribed to language attrition. Object
marker -n does not have allomorphs and is not restricted with respect to tense.","[246, 247]"
"7.6.1 Information questions
As imperative clauses, interrogative clauses convey a low degree of certainty
expressed by the speaker and are thus not marked with declarative -coy634. Specific
markers are the interrogative pronouns themselves (cf. 4.2.5), the question marker -ta
(cf. 4.2.5.1.2), and the question bound topic marker -xwi (found only in Vellard's
data; cf. 4.2.5.1.3).
(45)       culu-tfaj am tu
           what-QM you name
           'What is your (sg) name?'                                    (Uhle 1894:53)
(46)       hekis-kistana635 kuya-xwi
           who-SEP          house-QTP
           'Whose house is it?'                                         (Vellard 1951:34)
As indicated in (46), interrogative pronouns can be inflected with nominal case
markers. The interrogative pronoun may occur with the verbal predicate alone (47) or
the question may consist of the interrogative pronoun and a predicate clause (45, 46).
(47)       culu-m     peki
           what-CL=2 want
           'What do you want?'                                          (Métraux 1935:105)
Apart from these peculiarities, word order does not differ from the most common
types found in declarative clauses, i.e. SOV, SV, or OV. Since the interrogative
pronoun already marks the construction as not being declarative, no particular word
order is required. As with simple declarative clauses, deviations from these types
occur but represent only a minority within the group of information questions.
     Particularly in Uhle's data (1894) do we find a frequent repetition of the subject
or subject pronoun. Whether this is an emphatic device or a peculiarity of
interrogative clauses remains uncertain.",[296]
" 7.8.1 Coordinate clauses
Only two types of coordinate clauses can be established with some certainty:
juxtaposed and exclusive clauses. No means to express conjunction (e.g. 'and') or
disjunction (e.g. 'or', 'but') are found.
      Juxtaposed clauses consist of two (or more) main clauses following each other
without any further conjunction. In most cases, both coordinate clauses are marked
with declarative -cay.
(75)      taxa-cay mica650 tesa-cay
          sleep-DEC wick        extinguish-DEC
          'We sleep. We extinguish the wick.'

          extinguish the wick.)                                  (Uhle 1894:98.1)
If one of the coordinate clauses does not have declarative -cay (76), this probably
indicates a higher degree of clausal integration.
(76)      aciwa      cu:l-cay          curka untu hipu
          sail    fillout-DEC          great strong wind
          'The sail fills out, [it is a] great, strong wind.'    (Vellard 1949:162)
One of the coordinate clauses can be a predicate clause of any type (cf. 76 and 77).
No specific device is used to juxtapose a simple declarative and a predicate clause.
(77)      cunfij-kas-kaci-cay k^asi wir-i-l-i lik-a-cay

          'The water is good, I will drink.'            (Vellard 1967:11)
Often one of the coordinate clauses consists of the verbal predicate alone while the
other shows the unmarked word order of declarative clauses, i.e. SV or OV (cf. 75
and 78). Juxtaposed predicate clauses either precede or follow the coordinate clause.
(78)      Icepit-fajca-cay ni-stani     kepit-cay

          'We have to return, with that we return.'              (Vellard 1949:160)
By exclusive clauses I understand two coordinate clause one of which is negated with
ana (cf. Villafane 2004:152; cf. 6.3).

286                             UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAThe negated (= exclusive) as well as the non-exclusive clause both reveal the basic
word order of declarative clauses, i.e. in the exclusive clause, negation ana is
followed by either SV or OV. It can also consists of either a non-verbal predicate or
the verbal predicate alone, as in (80).

               'When the rain comes (= If it rains), I will not come.' (Muysken 2005:69)
However, the non-exclusive clause has a tendency to appear as a predicate clause
(79) or is more elaborate by including indirect complements (81 ), a feature not found
in exclusive clauses.

In most cases, both exclusive and non-exclusive clauses carry declarative -cay.
Negative ana occurs just with one clause, it appears only exceptionally in both
clauses.

There is only weak evidence for a possible conjunction nektaru 'because of, that is
why', and (83) is the only readily interprétable clause displaying this item. It is
possible that nektaru (provided it has been a regular conjunction) is related to the
Connective nikstani 'then, afterwards' but what this relationship might have been or
whether nikstani itself served as a conjunction, remains uncertain. Please note that
the preposed clause shows right-dislocation whereas the conjoined clause reveals an
unmarked word order.

7.8.2 Complement clauses
The term complement is understood here as an argument required by the semantics of
the matrix verb. The following discussion654 will be restricted to non-finite
complement clauses since finite complement clauses in Uchumataqu have the shape
of juxtaposed matrix clauses and are thus treated under the heading of coordination
(e.g. example 81).The data suggest that Uchumataqu allows for object complements
only.
       Non-finite complement clauses are built with either chain verb constructions or
action nominaliser -s(i) (cf. 5.6 and 5.7). What is called chain verb constructions here
differs from typical serial verb constructions since the chained verbs of Uchumataqu
do not denote aspects of one action or event but refer to different actions or events.
However, one action or event is usually dependent on the other. Furthermore, I would
like to point out that the data on complement clauses is limited and show little
variation with respect to the matrix verb (they are almost exclusively limited to
volition verbs). It is particularly with action nominaliser -s(i) that we lack entire
clauses in the data. This marker occurs mainly with singular items where an infinitive
is required.
       Chain verb constructions are indicated by zero marking of the complement verb,
i.e. it carries neither person, tense or aspect markers nor declarative -cay.
(84)      ana liks     pek-u-cay
          NEG drink want-lSG-DEC
          ' I do not want to drink. '                        (Muysken 2005:46)
The same is true for complements built with the action nominaliser: the complement
is marked by -s(i) but it does not cany any other tense, aspect, or mood marking.
(85)      kasari-s "" pek-u-cay

          'I want to marry.'                                (Uhle 1894:94.2)
Although the following example at first sight appears to be a typical instance of a
-sf/j-marked complement clause, the sentence is striking. The matrix verb is ok- 'to
go' and thus, it is remarkable that it selects the use of a complement at all.
Furthermore, the translation as provided by Métraux suggests a purposive
interpretation, which does not match the use of action nominaliser -s(i) as attested
elsewhere, and besides that one would expect either purpose marking -xapa or a
construction involving subject relativiser -ni with a motion verb in matrix position if
indeed a purpose meaning was intended. I present the clause but so far I am unable to
provide an explanation, except for the proposition that it represents a
misinterpretation.","[302, 303, 304]"
"3.2 Typological classification
Uchumataqu can be characterised as a moderately agglutinating language. Based on
the syntactic notion of word, a count of affixes per word results in the following
table. This counting was based on Vellard (1949), who is the only one to provide
entire texts and thus, instances of natural speech.
     As shown in table 3.1, nominal, pronominal, adverbial, and adjectival stems are
either zero marked or tend to have only one grammatical morpheme attached. Verbal
stems, however, mainly carry at least one grammatical morpheme, but generally they
have two morphemes attached. Particles and numerals have a tendency to be zero
marked. Thus, the overall picture is somewhat different from Aymara and Quechua,
which generally show a higher number of affixes per word. However, like Quechua
and Aymara, Uchumataqu can be likewise classified as an agglutinating language.

Table 3.1: Number of affixes per word
Criteria for defining a language as agglutinating are provided by Comrie (1981:40):
a) morpheme boundaries are clear-cut within a word, b) morphemes have an invariant
shape. Both these main criteria are fulfilled by Uchumataqu, as demonstrated by
examples (12) and (13).
(12) a.     lax-0-cay                            '(s)he plunges'
            la[x]-ku-cay216                      '(s)he had plunged'
            lak-aki-cay                          '(s)he will plunge'             (Vellard 1951:27)

            okwa-ku-cay211                       'you (sg) had gone'
            ok"" a-aki-cay                        'you (sg) will go'              (Vellard 1951:37)
(13)       pi.la                                 'pampa, sand'
           pi.la-naka                            'pampas'                        (Lehmann 1929b:21)
           kuya                                  'house'
           kuyaf-Jnaka                           'houses'                        (Vellard 1967:7, 20)
In each of the examples, morpheme boundaries are clear-cut, which makes it possible
to establish e.g. okwa- as a verbal stem and -aki as a morpheme attached to it. To each
of these suffixes, a meaning can be unequivocally assigned, e.g. -aki marks future
tense and -naka expresses plural. Further, the shape of the morphemes remains
mainly unaltered278 and recognisable, regardless of whether they are attached to e.g. a276
    The elision of/x/ is probably caused by following -ku
277
    Vellard provided only okwa-ku-cay as an example for first person singular and added ""etc"" Thus, the
form of second person singular is based on my interpretation
278
    Except for smaller adjustments to the phonological environment, which may result in allophones, as is
the case with e.g subject relativiser -ni and its allophone -m, which can be conditioned by following high
front vowel /i/
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                                 133
transitive or intransitive verb. These features sufficiently satisfy the requirements for
establishing Uchumataqu as an agglutinating language279.
      However, although the overall profile of Uchumataqu is that of an agglutinating
language, there are features reminiscent of either fusional or isolating language types.
It is particularly in the verbal system that portmanteau morphemes, characteristic for
fusional languages, are found. Thus, -u not only marks present tense but it also refers
to first person singular as does -a, marking future tense with first person singular.
Similar observations are made for the so-called In-Group Marker -acu, which
expresses first person plural exclusive and present tense, and habitual present tense
Marker -in I -ni, which encodes both a temporal (present tense) and aspectual
(Habitual) notion. Thus, these suffixes comprise two categories, mainly tense and
person marking ""to give a single, unsegmentable morph"" (Comrie 1981:41).
Furthermore, Uchumataqu has some isolating tendencies, particularly in the
pronominal system, where no difference is expressed between e.g. a pronominal
subject and a possessive pronoun280, as in (14) and (15):(14)       am qoya
           you house
           'your (sg) house'                                          (Uhle 1894:46)·
(15)       am ok tafnj-ni
           you go hunt-SR
           'you (sg) go hunting (lit.: 'you go as a hunter')' (Uhle 1894:94.1)
These differences with respect to typical agglutinating languages, such as Aymara
and Quechua, have already been observed by Muysken (2000:104) and, as Comrie
(1981:43) points out ""the majority (perhaps all) of the world's languages do not
correspond exactly to one or other of these types [i.e. isolating, agglutinating, or
fusional KH]"".","[148, 149, 150]"
"1.4.2.5.2 Vellard 1950
The data published in the 1950 article Contribution à l'étude des indiens Uru ou
Kot'sunswl were collected in 1941 and 1943 (Vellard 1950:54) with the language
consultants Manuel Inta and Carlos Kispe. When Vellard visited Irohito in 1950108 he
found that Manuel Inta had died as had some others who had worked together with
Vellard on earlier visits: Tomas Inta, Luis Inta, Andres and Luis Vila (Vellard
1950:51). Correspondingly, Vellard (1950:52) points out that only elderly people
speak Uchumataqu fluently while younger generations tend to use mainly Aymara
and communicate badly in Uchumataqu. Men who are married to Aymara women
     The article from 1950 is likewise published in French
     Apparently without collecting linguistic data
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                              47
even refuse completely to use Uchumataqu and choose Aymara instead. Their
children have Aymara as native language.
      Similar to his preceding publication, Vellard does not state whether he was
accompanied by an interpreter and how much time he spent in the community during
the data collection. The article is again published in French.
      The introductory section of Vellard's article outlines the changed circumstances
in Irohito (see above) and gives an overview of the demographic situation. In 1950
there were only 22 adults left in Irohito, while two families lived in nearby Waki 109
(Vellard 1950:52). Vellard (1950:54) also mentions that he had paid a visit to
Chipaya. He provides a basic linguistic comparison between Uchumataqu and
Chipaya stating that the varieties differ in most aspects and that Chipaya is by far less
endangered than Uchumataqu. This comparison is followed by some notes on the
phonological transcription system (cf. chapter 2). In contrast to Vellard's preceding
publication on Uchumataqu, this article comprises a word list but no texts. The word
list consists of 607 entries and is clearly focused on nouns, which cover several types
of semantic fields. In contrast to earlier publications, Vellard's word list is ordered
according to semantic fields. Most of the lexical entries have additional example
sentences110. A rough summary of the word list's contents is given below:      I. body parts                 VII. clothing
      II. kinship terms             VIII. tools
      III. directions               IX. music instruments
      IV. balsa rafts'""             X. plants
      V. house types                XI. domesticated and non-domesticated animals
      VI. household goods
In the introduction to the word list Vellard (1950:54, 55) adds some observations on
loan words. He points out that the number of loan words differs with respect to the
semantic field, i.e. when talking about body parts one hardly ever comes across loan
words, while they slightly increase in the semantic field of kinship terms. However,
Uchumataqu adopted only those kinship terms that refer to a relationship not origin to
the Uchumataqu system, such as e.g. kunari112 'sister-in-law' (Vellard 1950:62)'13.
The situation is entirely different with names designating plants, trees, and
agricultural terms: there, we find that mainly Aymara names are used to refer to
them. Vellard (1950:55) explains this by the Urus' long stay in an environment
without trees. Finally, Vellard points to the semantic field of balsa rafts and tools
used for fishing and states that there are hardly any loans from Aymara or Quechua.
This is explicable since fishing has been the Urn's economic base for centuries. In
sum, although there are still semantic fields with hardly any Aymara or Quechua109

influence, a considerable number of loan words can be found in Uchumataqu (cf.
1.1.3).
     Although Vellard's word list covers a wide range of semantic fields and consists
of a considerable number of entries, it is less useful for a grammatical description, as
in the current work. That is, it contains first and foremost lexical information and the
example clauses are usually short and simple""4. Furthermore, there is a certain
phonological variation in the data, as already pointed out by Vellard (1949:147, 148,
150). However, the lexical information can be verified by comparisons in most cases
and thus, is regarded as being reliable. This is also true for the basic phrases and
clauses provided in the list, although they are grammatically less informative.","[63, 64, 65]"

5.7.1 Gerund -ku
Gerund -ku marks the same subject for dependent and independent verb forms and is
best translated by English gerund -ing. In accordance with that, it expresses
simultaneousness.

            you see-GER laugh-laugh-1SG-DEC
            'Seeing you (sg), I laugh [and] laugh.'                           (Uhle 1894:94.2)
(93)        tiki-cay kwas-na521 k'ap-ku
            die-DEC water-LOC sink-GER
            '(S)he died, sinking into the water.'                             (Vellard 1967:4)Gerund -ku is the only element that can be attached to a subordinate verb form528 and
the use of declarative -cay is prohibited on the subordinate form.
     We find gerund -ku attached to action, motion, and cognition verbs and we may
therefore assume that there is no restriction with respect to verb class. Gerund -ku is
not selected by a specific verb or verb class in the matrix position.
      In most cases, the subordinate verb precedes the independent verb, as in
examples (92) and (94), although there are a few exceptions (cf. 93).
     Person reference is expressed either by the use of a subject or subject pronoun or
is otherwise indicated on the verb itself, as in (92) and (94).

The form -na, and its possible variant -an, is found only three times, so the database
on which the following statements are based is severely limited. Furthermore, the
clauses that contain -na are not entirely clear and it may be possible that -na does not
mark subordination at all. However, if we assume that -na is used for subordination,
then it expresses switch reference (glossed as SWR) combined with non-
simultaneousness, i.e. the action expressed by the -«α-marked verb form still has to
happen.(95)        tukunwa tiks-na tacikni litrai     ceri-s-n-a-cay

    Aymara locative form, cf 4 1 1 2 and 4 1.13 Person reference is based on Vellard's translation
528
    In fact, there are two instances in which -ku is preceded by the elements -n; and -na and once, it is
followed by an element -/ Since these cases are not entirely clear, I will treat them as misinterpretations
529
    The word hap- 'to run' is found only in Vellard's work ( 1949-67)
!ï0
    The expression litrai is a loan from Spanish retrato 'portrait' However, the form tacikni remains
uncertain, particularly since Vellard (1949 186, translation mine) himself does not provide a further
analysis but only points out ""I am myself not absolutely sure about the transcription of tiks' na-tacikni, it
is a future form of die, meaning 'the one strechted out"".(""Je ne suis pas absolument sûr de la transcription
de liks' na-tacikni; c'est une forme future de mort, littéralement 'qui est étendu"" )
238                            UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIAThe potential alternative form -an appears only once and there, an interpretation as
verb stem plus object marker -n is possible, too. The translation is based on Métraux
(ibid).
(96)        //' soni        luxl-s-ka-ra     tiks-t-in-cay  luli
            this man        eat-SU?-lC-DT531 die-RES-SR-DEC food
            cuki on-an-ki
            let_us give-swR-TOP
            'This man is nearly starved to death, let's give him food.'
                                                                    (Métraux 1935:97)
The form -an in example (96) is followed by Topic marker -ki, the use of which is
selected by the personal pronoun cuki 'let us'. But even if a clausal element such as
Topic marker -ki can appear on a subordinate verb form, we may assume that the use
of declarative -cay is impossible on a verb subordinated by -an or -na. According to
the examples (95) and (96), no morphemes precede the forms -an or -na.
      The limited database on switch reference subordination markers does not allow
any statement about potential verb class restrictions532, normal word order, or the
distribution of pronominal and clitic elements. With respect to the latter, we may
assume that the use of subjects or subject pronouns is obligatory should -na indeed
mark switch reference. This requirement is fulfilled for examples (95) and (96).
      It seems likely that particularly in its last stage Uchumataqu employed a
coordination strategy rather than switch reference subordination. In examples (97)
and (98), we find simple declarative clauses533 joined by coordination, each
containing its own subject or subject pronoun.

531
    -ka is glossed as incompletive (IC), -ra as distributive (DT) (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981 208, 281). If Ihis
interpretation is true, both elements are from Aymara origin, although it is not entirely certain whether the
assumption is accurate.
 52
    The three potential instances of -na I -an occur on cognition, action-process, and factive verbs If the
proposed interpretation of-na / -an is correct, the distribution does not point to a restriction with respect to
verb class
53)
    The end of a clause is indicated by declarative -cay (underlined).
"" 4 As indicated in the glosses cerk means 'to see, look' According to Vellard, it is translated here as 'to

5.7.3 Chain verb constructions
What may be understood as a kind of subcategory to subordination are the so-called
chain verb constructions (cf. Muysken 2001:108). The matrix verb is often the
volition verb pek- 'to want' and the complement verb is zero marked, i.e. it consists
of the verb stem alone. Although two different actions (e.g. 'want' and 'eat') are
expressed, these are closely related, as can also be seen by word order, where the
complement verb immediately precedes the matrix verb (cf. chapter 7.8.2).

If at all, chain verb constructions come closest to what could be described as
coreferential and non-simultaneous, although there are counterexamples such as
(101), which is simultaneous.

With respect to verb class, we find chain verb constructions involving action,
cognition, utterance, and motion verbs537. Although the database is limited, we may
assume that there is no restriction with regard to verb class. As in simple declarative
clauses, person reference is expressed mainly by the use of a subject or subject
pronoun, the latter one is frequently inflected with a subject clitic (cf. 99 and 100).","[253, 254, 255, 256]"

The form -paca occurs in two different functions in Uchumataqu. In its first function
it is attached to adverbs of time in order to act as intensifier (cf. 6.1.1). Both Aymara
and Quechua have a noun paca meaning 'time' and it is likely that Uchumataqu -
paca in its intensifying function on temporal adverbs has been inspired by it. There is
another form -paca on Uchumataqu wakpaca 'all, everything', which consists of
Aymara waki 'part, portion' (also 'price') (DeLucca 1983:444) and the totality
marking suffix -pacha (DeLucca 1983:328). The expression wakpaca itself is not
used in Aymara and waki occurs only in the last stage of Uchumataqu, as
documented by Vellard.
      The plural marker -naka occurs in both Aymara and Uchumataqu and it is
impossible to say whether its use on nouns is recent or not, whereas its use on the
personal pronoun ninaka 'they' is possibly a more recent development (cf. 4.1.4).
      Terminative marker -kama occurs in Aymara, Quechua, and Uchumataqu. In
Aymara and Quechua it has a distributive and terminative meaning. In Quechua,
terminative -kama also outlines the direction of a course or trajectory. This meaning
is not found in Aymara but a meaning of terminative -kama limited to Aymara is that
of'only', i.e. exclusiveness. In Uchumataqu, these different meanings of terminative
-kama have been reduced to temporal 'until'. It is this restricted use that gives rise to
the assumption that -kama spread from Aymara or Quechua into Uchumataqu and not
vice versa, although it is not impossible, either, that Aymara or Quechua adopted this
suffix from Uchumataqu and extended its meaning (cf. 4.1.1.6).
       A similar observation can be made for benefactive -taki, which has been
borrowed from Aymara. Uchumataqu adopted only the benefactive function, in
which benefactive -taki is translated as 'for'. In Uchumataqu, possessive predicate
clauses are created with the benefactive marker -taki and the copulative verb sel- 'to
be, exist'. These constructions are translated as 'for X exists', as in wir-takfij sel-cay
koya 'I have a house.' (lit.: 'For me a house exists.' Vellard 1951:33). This function
of benefactive -taki is not found in Aymara (cf. 4.1.2.2).
       The Uchumataqu resultative marker -t resembles the Aymara resultative marker
-ta with respect to form and function to some degree. It is possible that both suffixes
influenced each other or one inspired the use of the other, but Uchumataqu resultative
-/ is not a direct loan from Aymara -ta (cf. 5.2.1).
       The lexicon is by far that part of Uchumataqu that shows the largest degree of
borrowing. However, not every word shared with Aymara or Quechua is necessarily
a loan. We may assume that the name of fish, water birds, types of totora reed and
other water plants as well as denominations for balsa rafts, their parts, and tools for
hunting and fishing were adopted by Aymara and Quechua from Uchumataqu rather
than vice versa. However, when it comes to agricultural terms and words denoting
non-aquatic plants and species, expressions found in both Aymara and Uchumataqu
are probably loans in the latter. Spanish had some influence on Uchumataqu with
respect to kinship terms and, of course, modem technical devices. Note that one of
the last semantic fields not influenced are Uchumataqu numbers10, although Vellard   In contrast to Chipaya, where numerals above 4 have long been replaced by the Aymara terms
10                      UCHUMATAQU THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
(1951 18) reports pataka '100' instead of kalo-kalo, which would have been the
Uchumataqu word The word pataka is Aymara but also close to Quechua pachak
     Finally, I should mention some features that can be described as areal
phenomena rather than loans Among these areal features are the agglutinative nature
of Uchumataqu, its predominately SOV structure, stress on the penultimate syllable,
and the structure of the Uchumataqu nominal and verbal system, which resemble that
of Aymara and Quechua Thus, although Uchumataqu is genetically unrelated to
Aymara and Quechua, centuries-long contact produced a certain degree of adaptation
and similarity
     In the present study, I compare Uchumataqu to the northern Aymara variety
spoken around Lake Titicaca, which has been described by Porterie-Gutiérrez (1981)
and Huayhua Pari (2001), who carried out a study on the Peruvian variety of Aymara
Since Lake Titicaca stretches across the border of Peru and Bolivia, it is justified to
take also into consideration the Peruvian Aymara variety, which may as well have
exerted some influence on Uchumataqu Only if there is an Aymara element present
in my data but undescnbed by Porterie-Gutiérrez and Huayhua Pan do I refer to
works dealing with other Aymara varieties1 2 The present study
In the following I will briefly describe the theoretical framework applied for the
current study, the terminology resulting from the theoretical framework, and the
methodology used m working with the Uchumataqu data7 2 7 Theoretical framework and terminology
Given that the material on Uchumataqu is heterogenous and that the grammatical
description is meant for linguists from different backgrounds, no specific linguistic
theoretical framework is employed Instead, it is first and foremost a descriptive
work, whose theoretical framework can be best described by what Dixon (1997 128)
calls ""Basic Linguistic Theory"" Dryer (in prep 3) supplies the following explanation
of what can be understood by this ""It can thus be roughly described as traditional
grammar, minus its bad features (such as a tendency to describe all languages in
terms of concepts motivated for European languages), plus necessary concepts absent
from traditional grammar [ ] Basic linguistic theory differs from traditional
grammar most strikingly in its attempt to describe each language in its own terms,
rather than trying to force the language into a model based on European languages ""
That is, basic linguistic theory is primarily descriptive, adopting ideas, techniques,
etc from other theories, if they refer to or describe a phenomenon appropriately
      Works that contributed to a considerable degree to the framework of the current
description of Uchumataqu are among others Shopen (1985) and Payne (1997)
Correspondingly, specific terminology has been avoided whenever possible
However, if a particular theoretical concept or term has been borrowed, its usage in
the current grammatical description is explained
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                              11
1.2.2 Notes on methodology and presentation of the data
First, it is necessary to provide a definition of what is considered as primary and
secondary data in the current study. By primary data, I understand data that have
been collected during field-work and thus represent first-hand experience of
Uchumataqu and its speakers. Since the current work is primarily a linguistic
description, purely ethnographic data are considered mainly for background
information on the Uru culture and history (cf. Posnansky 1934, LaBarre 1941,
Palavecino 1949). I consider the following sources as primary data: Uhle (1894),
Polo (1901), Bacarreza (1910), Lehmann (1929), Métraux (1935), LaBarre (1941),
Palavecino (1949), Vellard (1949, 1950, 1951, 1967), Grinevald (1995), and
Muysken (2001, 2005). Secondary data are those that provide an analysis and
interpretation on the basis of primary data and therefore studies as e.g. Torero (2002)
are regarded as secondary data and add to the description only to a minor degree. The
grammatical description attempted is first and foremost concerned with primary
linguistic data on Uchumataqu.
      The spelling of the data quoted here is based on what has been established as the
phonemic system of Uchumataqu (cf. 2.1-2.10). However, it is not a phonemic
spelling in a strict sense, since at the present state of research I am unable to state
what the phonemes of e.g. the word 'to go' are. I will thus present different possible
spellings. This leads, of course, to a certain amount of variation. For example, the
verb for 'to go' is represented as either oq-, ok-, or ok""a (another example can be
found in table 2.1). For further discussion of orthographical practices and
representation, cf. 2.14.
      In most cases I adopt the translations provided by the researchers, who have
been with the Uchumataqu speakers and probably had the best opportunities to cross-
check their material. However, in case I propose an analysis, interpretation, and / or
translation different from that of the researcher, the original analysis, interpretation
and / or translation is provided in brackets. This also applies to Uchumataqu forms,
phrases, or clauses for which I propose a different transcription, as is the case with
e.g. -srap'pa (Vellard 1949-67). I propose to transcribe the form as -s-xapa but add
Vellard's original transcription in brackets. Elements I reconstruct, such as e.g. topic
marker -k[i], are marked by brackets, while parenthesis mark additions, restrictions,
etc. made by the researchers themselves. However, in any case, glosses are mine.
      The primary data are always quoted with the year of publication, i.e. although
Vellard might have collected certain data in 1938, he published them in 1949 and
accordingly, I quote material from this work as Vellard (1949). Only in the case of
the unpublished material of Uhle and Lehmann do I refer to the year the material has
been collected. In Uhle's case, this would be 1894, while Lehmann is quoted as
 1929b and 1929d. Since no other researcher (with the exception of Uhle, see below)
provides data from outside Irohito, this is necessary only with Lehmann.
      As will be further outlined below, Uhle (1894) aims to merge data from
Uchumataqu and Chipaya in his manuscript and in some cases does not indicate
whether a certain example comes from Uchumataqu or Chipaya. Therefore, I decided
to use only those clauses, phrases, etc. that are clearly marked as from Uchumataqu.
However, in some cases I also quote unmarked material, i.e. material the origin of
12                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
which is uncertain but I only do so when that material can be confirmed by other
sources on Uchumataqu (e.g. Vellard 1949-67). An example is the phrase am qoya
'your house' (Uhle 1894:46), which is not marked for origin. Since identical phrases
are found in other sources that exclusively contain data from Uchumataqu, such as
amp kui[a]u 'your house' (Vellard 1967:29), Uhle's unmarked example clause can
be included in the grammatical description. However, such cases are exceptional and
if an unmarked example from Uhle's manuscript is given, it is indicated in a footnote.","[25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"
"1.4.2.2 José T. Polo (1841-1918)
José Toribio Polo was bom in Ica in 1841 and went to Lima to study history at the
Convictorio de San Carlos and the Seminary of Santo Toribio but never completed
his studies there69 (Dager Alva 2000:147, footnote 48). Beside other occupations, he
worked at the Archive del Cabildo eclesiastico, the Tribunal de Cuentas, and the
Biblioteca Nacional, of which he was subdirector (Dager Alva 2000:137, footnote 3).
Polo died in Lima in 1918.
     According to Polo's profession the introduction to his work Indios uros del Peru
y Bolivia (1901) contains a detailed compilation of notes on the Uru in historical
sources, including a comparison of the historical representation of Cunza, Puquina,
and Uru (pp. 445-455). Since at that time Uchumataqu was considered to be identical
with or related to the historical Puquina mentioned by Ore (1607), Polo provides a
comparative word lists of Puquina-Uchumataqu-Spanish, which consists of twenty
items and includes the numerals 1-10 (p. 456). This list is followed by a Puquina
version of the Lord's Prayer (p. 456). Polo also adds a brief comparative word list
Atacameno-Uchumataqu of only seven items (p. 457). The following etymological
discussion of the name 'Uro' (p. 457) as well as some anthropological considerations
(pp. 459-463) are also dominated by historical considerations. These aspects make up
more than half of Polo's work on the Uru.
     The Uchumataqu-Spanish word list (pp. 464-479) itself consists of about 300
words, which are ordered according to the Spanish alphabet. It comprises nouns of
    As Dager Alva (2000.147) points out, at this time historiography was not a subject with an academic
tradition and it still lacked a unified methodology. Correspondingly, Dager Alva (2000:135) describes Polo
as belonging to a ""generation of historians in transition between an amateur-like history and a more
professional one""69. Regardless of these restrictions, Polo can be characterised as a historiographer and his
first and foremost field of activity was history
34                               UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
several semantic fields, e.g. kinship terms, body parts, clothing, domesticated and
non-domesticated animals as well as natural and religious phenomena, personal
pronouns, and numerals. The list further contains directions, adjectives, colour terms,
and verbs of every class. Polo adds footnotes that either explain in greater detail a
particular word or point to the Aymara or Quechua origin of the item. The author also
provides a list of fourteen Spanish loan words (p. 478) and about 30 phrases (p. 478-
479), which he considered to be of frequent use. They include the questions for food,
one's name, and one's well-being. Polo concludes his article with some brief remarks
on his spelling of Uchumataqu lexemes and some basic grammatical observations on
compounding, personal pronouns, numerals, adjectives, the negation ana, and kinship
terms. He also provides basic notes about the verbal tense system, adverbs, and the
agglutinative character of Uchumataqu (pp. 479-482).
      It is noteworthy that Polo does not use a particular phonological transcription
system but represents the Uchumataqu items by using the Spanish alphabet. The only
adaptation is that [kk], [pp], and [tt] are employed to ""reinforce the sound and also
distinguish certain words""70 (Polo 1901:480, translation mine).
      Polo remains vague about the circumstances under which he collected his data.
He mentions a small vocabulary by Augusto Benavides (Polo 1901:464), which he
used to compare it to his own data. Polo ascribes differences to either dialectal
variation or to a certain ""confusion on the Urus' part for being questioned in
Aymara""71 (Polo 1901:464, translation mine). It remains uncertain whether Polo
refers to Benavides' language consultants, who were confused for being questioned
in Aymara, or his own. In case he refers to his language consultants, it is still
unknown whether Polo spoke Aymara sufficiently to communicate directly with the
Uchumataqu speakers or whether he relied on an interpreter. Further, Polo does not
specify who his language consultants were, but since he uses a plural form when
refering to them he must have worked with at least two speakers. Polo was
accompanied by Javier Gonzalez del Valle, a professor at the Colegio National in
Puno, and Enrique Gamero, likewise a resident of Puno. The latter contributed to
Polo's article by collecting data in the villages of Ancoaqui and Ahuallamaya (Polo
 1901:463). Polo (ibid.) also expresses his thanks to Victor R. Cavinos, who left him
some words and phrases of Uchumataqu. Since both Gamero as well as Cavinos are
Spanish surnames, it is unlikely that they were native speakers of Uchumataqu and
therefore Polo's article does not only comprise his own data but also those of other
researchers, which, however, is not indicated in the word list itself. Thus, it remains
entirely unknown whom Polo worked with, whether he had an interpreter, and which
of the data result from his own field-work and which do not.
     However, Polo (1901:463) mentions that he visited the Lake Titicaca region in
February 1897 to collect his data, which then were published four years later. He
does not further specify the duration of this trip but since Polo (1901:463) refers to it
as ""una ràpida excursion"", it must have been a rather short time. For all we know this
was Polo's only visit to the Uru, at least for linguistic purposes. We do not know of
     ""Las letras kk, pp, /ƒ, son para reforzar el somdo, y distinguir asi algunas palabras "" (italics by author)
     ""[...] pueden provenir de equivocación de los indios al ser preguntados en aimarâ ""

which kind Polo's relationship to his language consultants was, but it is remarkable
that he characterises the Uru as remaining in their ""primitive state"" and points out
that the Spanish conquerers could oppress them only by work and taxes (Polo
1901:459, 460). This description shows that Polo was not only influenced by the
picture of the Uru as presented in historical sources but also by the general idea of his
time that there is a constant progression from primitive to less primitive to civilised
human communities72 (cf. Dager Alva 2000:138).
     For an evaluation of Polo's data, we have to take into consideration that Polo's
language consultants and their personal backgrounds remain unknown as does the
exact duration of Polo's apparently brief stay with the Uchumataqu speakers.
Furthermore, we do not know whether Polo needed an interpreter. Finally, his article
contains data other than his own, but it is not indicated which these are. However, the
lexical material presented by Polo is mainly congruent with that of other researchers,
although similarities are sometimes difficult to establish due to Polo's uncommon
spelling. The phrases, clauses, and verbal paradigms hardly ever agree with those of
other sources. It happens frequently that Polo reports a feature which other sources
do not mention or else a particular feature is similar in all sources except for Polo.
That is, Polo's phrases, clauses, and paradigms can be hardly verified and thus, his
grammatical material is only in part reliable.","[50, 51, 52]"
"3.1 Roots, stems, and words
Before describing the morphological entities of Uchumataqu, I would like to point to
a somewhat inconsistent use of terminology in the literature. Thus, particularly the
terms 'root' and 'stem' are often used in contradictory ways and what is defined as
'root' in one study describes a 'stem' in another one. I will adopt a definition for the
terms 'root' and 'stem' that is not bound to a certain theory, as provided by Payne
(1997:24). According to this author, a root can be defined as ""an unanalyzable form
that expresses the basic lexical content of the word,"", while stem can be described as
""consist[ing] minimally of a root, but may be analyzable into a root plus derivational
morphemes. [...] Like a root, a stem may or may not be a fully understandable
word."". Example (1) presents some roots of Uchumataqu.
(1)       un-                   'to give, lend'                  (Polo 1901:478)
          oq-                   'to go'                          (Uhle 1894:90)
          soni                  'man, human being'               (Métraux 1935:98)
          kaku                  'net'                            (Vellard 1949:163)
The following items may be analysed as Uchumataqu stems.
(2)       yuxki okni            'guide'                          (Lehmann 1929b:7)
          cerini                ' looked at, upon '              (Uhle 1894:71 )
The expression yuxki okni 'guide' is a compound that consists of the directional
adverb yuxki 'in front of and the verb ok- 'to go', which is nominalised by the
subject relativiser -ni. The construction can literally be translated as 'the one who
goes ahead'. The component okni, literally 'goer', is interpreted as a stem. The
second example cerini 'looked at, upon' can be analysed as consisting of the verb
cer- 'to see' and an adjectival state marker -ini. The application of the marker -mi
turns the verb into an adjectival state (cf. 3.6.2 and 4.3.5). It has to be noted that the
instances in (2) are exceptional since in many cases the difference between roots and
stems is not visible in Uchumataqu. For example, the expression sisni 'sorcerer'
(example mine) can be analysed as being composed of the verbal root sis- 'to know'
and the subject relativiser -ni, meaning 'the one who knows'. In this case, sisni can
be analysed as a stem. It can also be interpreted as the lexicalised expression
'sorcerer', in which case it would be a root. Since the degree of lexicalisation of a
particular term often remains uncertain, I will prefer the term 'stem' over 'root'.275
     With respect to the number of syllables in stems (cf. 2.13.1), we find that
nominal and adjectival stems can have up to three syllables. Forms consisting of four
  I owe thanks to Simon van de Kerke for his useful comments on this topic.
130                        UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
syllables are the result of compounding and lexicalisation processes, as e.g. in
pikiltani 'the two together', where the Numeral pisk 'two' is combined with
comitative Marker -stani and linking element -il. However, on the average, adverbs
tend to have either one or two syllables. If an adverb comprises three syllables, this is
likewise the result of a lexicalisation process, as in wirwina 'last' (Vellard 1951:19),
which is composed of win 'back; anus' and an unanalysable element -wina. Verbal
stems are likewise limited to a maximum of two syllables. However, since verbs are
almost always inflected with morphological markers, the final stem vowel is often
deleted during this process and thus, verbs often appear to be monosyllabic, although
the stem is actually bisyllabic. Only in a few cases the final stem vowel is maintained
during inflection, as can be seen in examples (3) and (4) (final stem vowel bold).
(3)       ceri-s-n-a-cay
          see-su-OB2-FU-DEC
          'I will see it.'                              (Vellard 1949:168)
(4)       pica-x
          come-JU
          '(S)he shall come!'                           (Uhle 1894:92.2)
The elision of the final stem vowel caused by inflection often makes it necessary to
reconstruct it.
     Only in interrogative and subordinate clauses, as well as in chain verb
constructions do verbs appear in the shape of their stem (see also sections 5.7.3, 7.6,
and 7.8.2). Nominal stems, on the other hand, can occur without marking, as is
frequently the case with subjects and direct objects, which are only optionally marked
by topic marker -ki. The same situation is found with adjectival and adverbial stems,
particularly in attributive function, where they are often zero marked (cf. 3.2).
     However, both verbal and nominal stems form the basis for further inflectional
and derivational processes, as shown in the following examples (stems bold).
(5)       hisk-n-u-cay
          afraid-OB2-lSG-DEC
          'it frightens me'                             (Vellard 1949:166)
(6)       qoi-ksi

(7)       tax-si
          sleep-AN
          'bed (lit.: 'that which is for sleeping')'    (Métraux 1935:100)
Adjectival and adverbial stems take nominal morphological markers as well, but can
also be inflected with adjectival predicator -kasi (cf. 4.3.3 and 6.1.6).
(8)        sies-kfisjtani
          yesterday-SEP
          'since yesterday'                             (Uhle 1894:23,49)
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                   131
(9)       yafsij-kasi
          now-PRE
          'it is now'                                  (Vellard 1949:162)
Before turning to the average number of affixes per morpheme and the related
question of the tyological profile of the language, I will discuss the basis on which
the items quoted in (5) to (9) can be termed 'words'. That is, how is it possible to say
that e.g. yafsij-kasi (example 9) is construed of one single word and not of two, such
as *ya[si]ka si. As the discussion of phonology (chapter 2) has shown, phonological
criteria are a less reliable means for establishing word boundaries and thus, I will
adopt a syntactic definition of the term 'word', as provided by Anderson (1985:153):
""The units which can thus be permuted or interrupted freely by other 'words' can
therefore be taken to establish a syntactic notion of ""word."". Examples (10) and (11)
present such cases.
(10)      wala-kfij       aski-cay   iyai
          village-TOP far-DEC         more
          'The village is further away.'               (Métraux 1935:100)
(11)      wata iya-cay aski-n
          village more-DEC far-?
          'The village is further away.'               (Métraux 1935:104)
Sentences such as (10) and (11) establish wata, iya, and aski as discrete lexical items,
whereas no similar case involving -kasi can be found. Thus, e.g. iya can be
established as a word, while -kasi cannot. Once word boundaries are established, they
can be further supported by morphological and even phonological evidence, such as
that e.g. declarative -cay is always word final, and that words do not begin with /r/.","[146, 147, 148]"
"7.8.3.3 Conditional clauses
Conditional clauses consist of an 'if-clause', the adverbial clause marking the
condition, and a 'then-clause', the matrix clause describing the event or action    The expression litrat is a loan from Spanish retrato 'portrait' However, the form tacikni remains
uncertain, particularly since Vellard himself does not provide a further analysis.

following from the condition (cf. Thompson and Longacre 1985:190). The data on
possible conditional clauses is provided by Uhle (1894:92.1) and consists of six
clauses. Thus, the database is rather limited. The morphological marker of a
conditinal adverbial clause is -txani or its allomorph -xani. In the database, no
morphological device is used to make a difference between reality and unreality
conditionals (cf. 96) (cf. 5.2.1 and 5.8.2).

Adverbial manner clauses modify the way an action is performed or an event takes
place. Manner clauses are built by subject relativiser -ni (cf. Thompson and Longacre
1985:178f) in its agentive function (cf. 5.6.1) with a motion verb in matrix position.

As Thompson and Longacre (1985:185) define: ""purpose [...] clauses can be seen as
providing explanations for the occurrence of a given state or action [...]."" (marking
by the author). This type of adverbial clause is marked by purpose -xapa (cf. 4.1.2.3).

    The use of habitual present tense marker -in is striking here. An alternative interprelalion would be to
analyse the expression as cixt-n-xam, ι e rain-0B2-CD However, the use of object marker -n would be
even more awkward since 'to rain' is intransitive It may be possible to understand habitual present tense
-in as 'constantly' rather than 'habitually' although no firm conclusions can be drawn See also 5 1 2

    Uhle translated this clause as past tense However, no device indicating past can be established
663
    The form lumini is a loan from Spanish tomin, a certain kind of currency The element -wi is unknown

    The element -sxi cannot be explained but it is possible that it constitutes a clitic element of third person
s followed by a linking vowel.

          'We go to [a place] far away for making a totora rope.' (Vellard 1949:154)7.8.4 Relative clauses
In contrast to adverbial clauses, relative clauses modify a noun or noun phrase (cf.
Payne 1997:325). In Uchumataqu, relative clauses are built with the subject
relativiser -ni, the same morpheme that also functions in manner adverbial clauses665.
The database on Uchumataqu relative clauses is limited and in some instances, the
translations do not support a relative clause interpretation. However, it seems
possible to establish two types of relative clauses. In accordance with basic SOV
order, relative clauses are prenominai, i.e. the relative clause precedes its head noun.
(101)        sis-ni-cay666 ti soni-ki
             know-SR-DEC this man-TOP
             'a sorcerer (lit.: a man who knows)'                          (Métraux 1935:106)
In the following example (102), the relative clause of the first example becomes the
head noun. Thus, sisni 'sorcerer' has to be regarded as a lexicalised expression, and
cannot be analysed the same way as in example (101), since the relative clause
follows its head noun.
(102)        k'uka ceri-ni sisni-cay
             coca see-SR sorcerer-DEC
             'A sorcerer who reads the coca.'                             (Vellard 1951:6)
In two cases, a headless relative clause occurs. ""Headless relative clauses are those
clauses which themselves refer to the noun that they modify."" (Payne 1997:328)
(103). From the two clauses available, we may assume that the headless relative
clauses refer to a non-specific head noun (cf. Payne 1997:328).
(103)        haira661    ana s-'kis-ni           pek
             lazybones NEG CL=3-work-SR want
             ' A lazybones who does not want to work. '                    (Métraux 1935:103)
As shown in (101), the subject of the relative clause can be inflected with declarative
-cay but in most cases, it is the head noun that takes this marker. From the available
examples it appears that Uchumataqu allows the relativisation of subjects only.","[307, 308, 309]"
"3.6.3 Verbs
Verbs express actions, events, and processes and their prototypical function is to act
as predicates (Schachter 1985:9). However, in Uchumataqu verbs can function as
arguments as well, i.e. they take up a function usually reserved for nouns. It is
possible to distinguish two different kinds of verbal arguments. The first group
consists of nominalised verbs, or as Schachter (1985:9, italics by the author) puts it,
""verbal nounsfs]"", i.e. forms that are derived from verbs but which cannot function as
verbs any more. In Uchumataqu, verbal nouns are built by nominalisation with
subject relativiser -ni or action nominaliser -s(i) (105 and 106).
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                               157
(105)        hek-stan(i) am am-ki     cis(i)             ta[n]-ni ok-aki
             who-COM you you-TOP species_of_fish hunt-SR go-FU
             ""Whom will you (sg) go hunting cisi fish with?' (Uhle 1894:94.1)
(106)        ikan-si kumi pek
             rest-AN you want
             'Do you (sg) want to rest?'                               (Vellard 1949:169)
Neither ta[n]-ni nor ikan-si could serve as a predicate of the given clause but instead
are arguments of ok- 'to go' ana pek- 'to want', respectively.
     The second group of verbal arguments consists of zero marked forms. Please
compare example (107) to example (108).
(107)        kunua pek-u-cay
             woman want-1 SG-DEC
             'I want a woman (= wife).'                                 (Vellard 1967:14)
(108)        sisa pek-u-cay
             know want-1 SG-DEC
             'I want to know.'                                          (Vellard 1967:19)
In example (108), no distinctive marking is found on the verb sisa- 'to know' and
morphosyntactically it behaves like a noun. Furthermore, nouns themselves can be
the predicate of a clause and these nominal predicates are not marked distinctively,
either328, since Uchumataqu does not employ a copula to mark nouns used as
predicates (cf. example 109 and 3.6.1).
(109)        wakii29 son[i]-cay tiksi
             many      man-DEC here
             'There are a lot of people here.'                          (Métraux 1935:99)
That puts Uchumataqu into a situation as described by Schachter (1985:12): ""[...] a
functional distinction between nouns and verbs becomes difficult to establish to the
extent that nouns occur as predicates and verbs as arguments without any distinctive
marking."". To a certain degree we find this overlap between the two categories in
Uchumataqu.
      Notions typically associated with Uchumataqu verbs are tense, aspect, and mood
(cf. Schachter 1985:10), while the verbal notions voice and polarity are not marked in
Uchumataqu. Nouns do not express any of these concepts

158                             UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
Thus, from a structural point of view nouns and verbs can be clearly distinguished in
Uchumataqu. The categories of tense, aspect, and mood are confined to verbs,
whereas notions such as e.g. number are expressed by nouns only.
     Like most if not all languages Uchumataqu has intransitive and transitive verbs,
although the argument of a transitive verb is not necesarily expressed overtly. This is
particularly the case when object marker 2 -n is applied and we may assume that the
argument of these instances is either already known from context (example Ilia, b,
and c), or else easily inferable (for further discussion, cf. 5.4.3).
( I l l ) a.      awaritism    hun-n-ay
                  spirits      give-OB2-IMP
                  'Give me [some] spirits!'
            b.    hun-n-a-cay
                  give-OB2-FU-DEC
                  'I will give it.'
            c.    lik-a-cay        hap 'pay
                  drink-FU-DEC father
                  'I will drink [it], oh father!'                (Vellard 1949:168)
Although one would expect to find object marker 2 -n in (111c), it is missing from
(111c). This may be due to the fact that the argument of likacay 'I will drink' has
already been established in the previous conversation and its marking by -n or overt
expression is considered unnecessary.
      Uchumataqu does not show a structural distiction between verb classes. The
different kinds of verb class that can be distinguished semantically are motion verbs,
action verbs, action-process verbs, factive, cognition, and utterance verbs (cf. Payne
1997:54ff). Below, the most common types of verb class are listed with examples:
         MOTION VERBS                      ACTION VERBS
         ok-      'to go'                  ekansnu 'I rest'
         pic-     'to come'                tax-    'to sleep'

CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                        159
The verb classes are structurally not distinctive, i.e. every member of every verb class
can be inflected with e.g. future tense -aki. However, the verb classes select different
nominal case markers (for further discussion, cf. chapter 4).
      In sum, on the basis of their functional properties verbs are not always easily
distinguished from nouns and with respect to function we find a considerable overlap
between these categories. As has been shown for nouns and adjectives there are no
clear-cut boundaries between the several parts of speech in Uchumataqu. However, in
terms of their structural properties verbs can be set apart from other word classes by
their ability to be marked for tense, apect, and mood. These concepts are encoded
verbally and are not found on any other grammatical category in Uchumataqu.
The following table summarises what has been said about the three main grammatical
categories in Uchumataqu. Shaded areas denote overlaps between categories. Please
note that adjectival subcategories are not considered.","[173, 174, 175, 176]"
"4.4 The numeral system
The Uchumataqu numeral system is a decimal one, as is shown in the way of
building numbers higher than ten. Numbers up to 99 are built on the base of qhalo
'ten'. In Uchumataqu we find the following numerals:
208                         UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
(160)         ci              'Γ         taqcuku            '6'
              piski           '2'        tu.ku              '7'
              cep™            '3'        qu.nku             '8'
              paxpiki         '4'        sanqu              '9'
              taqsnuku        '5'        qhalo              '10      (Muysken 2005:36)
Cardinal numbers higher than ten are built as possessor-possessed constructions
where possessive -ci marks possession on the possessed (cf. 4.1.2.1).
     The numbers 11-19 are built with qhalo as possessor with the digit in the
function of the possessed. Here we find the following order: ten-digit-POS(-POS).
(161)         kalu    paxk'pik'i-ci-ci
              ten    four-POS-POS
              'fourteen'                                             (Vellard 1951:18)
For the numbers 20-99 the reverse order holds: digit-ten as in (162), or digit-ten-
digit-posas in (163).
(162)         cep      kalo
              three ten
              'thirty'                                               (Vellard 1951:18)
(163)         cep     kalo pisk 'i-ci-ci
              three ten two-pos-pos
              'thirty-two'                                           (Vellard 1951:18)
Possessive -ci is attached only to digits, ie: 11-19, 21-29, etc 452 . Constructions as
(163) can be understood as a possessive structure with the digit being possessed and
inflected with -ci. However, possessive -ci is not attached to 20, 30, 40, etc (example
162). These are built in the way of digit-ten without taking possessive -ci.
      Cardinal numbers 200 to 900 are built in the way of: digit-hundred, without
possessive -ci (164). One hundred itself is expressed as qhalo qhalo (lit: 'ten ten') or
with the Aymara ioanpataka.
(164)         konko pataka
              eight hundred
              'eight hundred'                                        (Vellard 1951:19)
Numbers from 101 to 199 etc. are built in the following way: hundred-digit(-ten)(-
POS).(165)         pataka        pisk'i-ci-ci
              onehundred two-POS-POS
              'one hundred and two'                                  (Vellard 1951:18)451
    The forms given by Muysken are chhip and chhepe, respectively, but they will not be used in the
following since Uchumataqu does not have an aspirated palatal voiceless affricate *[chh], as outlined in
chapter 2. Furthermore, the sources agree on that the form for the numeral 'three' is cep, which will be
employed instead.
452
    In Muysken (2005) the use of possessive -ci on numerals is not demonstrated any more The loss of this
morpheme is probably due to language death
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOMINAL SYSTEM                                                                             209
(166)          pataka        cep     kalo

As with cardinal numbers 11 to 99 possessive -ci is attached only to digits but not to
ten (166). The numeral 1000 is expressed as waranka, which is a loan from Quechua
or Aymara. For numbers above 900 we have only fragmentary data and this topic will
therefore not be treated here. Numerals as quantifiers of nouns appear in the modifier
position preceding the head noun.
(167)           wir-ki patak?53         watfaj-ci-cay
                I-TOP     onehundred year-POS-DEC
                'I am one hundred years old.' (lit: 'I have one hundred years.')
                                                              (Métraux 1935:91)
Multiplication is expressed by Aymara wasa 'time(s)' (cf. Middendorf [1891]
1955:70).
(168)          cep      wasa
               three times
               ' three times '                                           (Métraux 1935:97)
According to Uhle (1894:32.1) an ordinal relationship is expressed by cardinal
numbers, too. Thus, an utterance like cep quya (Uhle 1894:32.1) can be translated as
either 'three houses' or 'the third house'.
     With regard to morphological markers we find only three forms that are attached
to numerals. These are declarative -cay, Topic marker -ki, and possessive -ci. Plural
marker -naka and numerals do not appear together since plurality is expressed by the
numeral itself (cf. 4.1.4).454
     There are two lexicalised exceptions where a numeral is combined with case
marking comitative -stani. These arepikiltani Ipukultani 'the two' and cepultani 'the
three'(cf. 4. 1.3).

to adjectives in that they do not take nominal suffixes (others than -ci) but, on the other hand, are separated
from adjectives because they do not accept predicator -kasi but instead must be marked with possessive ci

5 THE VERBAL SYSTEM
In contrast to nouns, verbs do not express time stable concepts but denote actions,
processes, and events. Uchumataqu marks tense, aspect, mood, and grammatical
functions on the verb. According to their semantic content, several kinds of verb
classes can be proposed, such as e.g. motion or action verbs.This may have
consequences for affixation possibilities. Another subcategory in forms according to
which Uchumataqu verbs may be ordered is the distinction between active and stative
verbs. The verb sel- 'to be' functions as a copulative verb.","[224, 225, 226, 227, 228]"
"1.4.2.3.2 Manuscript from Ch'imu (fair copy)
In contrast to the preceding manuscript, Lehmann supplies more detailed background
information in the manuscript from Ch'imu and also refers to his visit to Ancoaqui.
He visited Ch'imu on 26lh October 1929 where he met Florentino Valcufia, an elderly
fisherman who lived in the village. According to Lehmann's description, he started
working with Florentino Valcufia on the spot and collected a few hundred words.
When Florentino's son Nicolas Valcufia, alcalde90 of Ch'imu, appeared Lehmann
persuaded Nicolas to accompany him to Puno. They kept working at Lehmann's
hotel in Puno but Nicolas Valcufia returned to Ch'imu the same night. Although
Lehmann mentions her in the manuscript, the marniti Juanita Cuno did not
contribute to the data collection. Again, Lehmann spent only one afternoon in the Uni
community and did not return for further interviews. However, it is noteworthy that
Lehmann was the only researcher ever to have visited Ch'imu for the purpose of
collecting linguistic data. As such, his manuscript from Ch'imu can be regarded as
unique.
     Lehmann's interpreter was Enrique Rodriguez Averanta, as is stated in the
original manuscript92; in the fair copy Lehmann (1929d:iii)93 only mentions that the
interpreter is a ""known poet"". He spoke Aymara with the Valcufia family and the
languages thus used in data recording were Spanish, Aymara, and Uchumataqu.
     Lehmann made the fair copy in his hotel in La Paz (date unspecified) and on
board the ship back to Europe. The date given here is January 30th 1930, i.e. about
three months after his trip to Ch'imu. Like in the Ancoaqui manuscript Lehmann uses
Spanish, again with the exception of the introduction and some terms of which he
possibly did not know the Spanish name.
     The manuscript from Ch'imu is slightly shorter than the one from Ancoaqui and
consists of 29 pages with 324 entries. Until p. 14 / 188 the word list is ordered     Alcalde can be equated with the function of a mayor

alphabetically and contains mainly the same items as the Ancoaqui list, i.e. mainly
concrete nouns referring to body parts, clothing and such. On the following five
pages, Lehmann provides directions, temporal adverbs and expressions as well as
conjugations of the verbs 'to be' and 'to eat' and a possessive paradigm for the word
'house'. Numerals 1 to 10, 20, and 40 are provided on p. 19 to be followed by further
lexical entries, which do not belong to a particular semantic field but comprise only
nouns. Page 24 / 273 contains another example of a possessive paradigm of 'house',
which, however, is note complete since second and third person plural are missing.
Lehmann supplies purely lexical information on the following pages, but on pp. 27
and 28 adds conjugations of the verbs 'to be' and 'to give', again providing single
entries on 'I am not', 'I was', and 'I was not'. The verb 'to give' is used as an
example of a transitive verb. Lehmann repeats the drawing of the traditional loom
from Ancoaqui but this time lists thirteen items designating its parts. The headline
clearly states that the drawing was made two weeks earlier in Ancoaqui, so it is likely
that Lehmann used the older drawing in the absence of a real loom to collect some
more terms with Nicolas Valcuna. Most of these are German, probably because
Lehmann did not have the appropriate Spanish word at hand.
      According to a final note, Lehmann wrote the introduction on March δ""1 1937 in
Berlin, i.e. almost eight years after his trip to Ancoaqui and Ch'imu.
     As mentioned above, Lehmann notes which data were contributed by Florentino
or Nicolas Valcuna. It is noteworthy that the items provided by Florentino Valcufla
show a higher degree of Aymara influence than do those of his son Nicolas. This is
particularly the case with numerals and possessive paradigms. Florentino counts in
Uchumataqu until 4 but changes to Aymara then, while Nicolas gives all the
numerals in Uchumataqu. A similar observation concerns the possessive paradigms:
the one provided by Florentino is incomplete (see above) and it shows considerable
influence from Aymara due to the suffixed endings -ma and -pa. The paradigm given
by Nicolas is complete and is close to what other sources report as possession
marking, although Nicolas gives anxat as the pronoun of third person singular, which
cannot be confirmed by other sources. We find the following distribution of the data:
in more concrete fields, such as e.g. the making of balsa rafts, food, and animals,
most of the data were provided by Florentino Valcuna, whereas more abstract terms,
such as temporal adverbs, directions and all grammatical items were contributed by
his son Nicolas. As to the reason, we can only speculate. It is possible that Lehmann
found Nicolas a more suitable language consultant on Uchumataqu than his father.
      With respect to how the data were collected, the manuscript from Ch'imu is
restricted by the same considerations as is the one from Ancoaqui, although Lehmann
supplies information about his language consultants. An evaluation of the linguistic
data is hardly possible due to the following reasons. First, the items provided by
Florentino Valcuna are to a certain degree influenced by Aymara, and his command
of Uchumataqu seems to have been weaker than that of his son. Second, since
Lehmann is the only person ever to have collected data in Ch'imu, a comparison with
the remaining sources, all on Ancoaqui, would not yield reliable results. Differences
can be ascribed to a higher degree of language attrition in Ch'imu and / or to dialectal
variation. Since there is no further material on Ch'imu, the question for dialectal
40                         UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
variation has to remain unanswered. What can be said is that even in those cases
where a Ch'imu word is close to its Ancoaqui equivalent, we almost always find
slight differences. In other cases, in particular in the verbal paradigms, the data
cannot be verified at all, i.e. they are neither Uchumataqu nor e.g. Aymara. This is
the case with e.g. anxata inarata (Lehmann 1929d:17), which is translated as 'he
eats' but inarata is neither Uchumataqu nor Aymara nor Quechua (for anxata see
above). Thus, data from the Ch'imu manuscript will be used only when they can be
verified by other sources on Ancoaqui.","[55, 56, 57]"
"1.4.2.4 Alfred Métraux (1902-1963)
The Swiss scholar Alfred Métraux was bom in Lausanne on November 5' 1902 and
in 1922 began his studies at the École des Chartes, the Sorbonne, and the École
Pratique des Hautes Études in Paris97 (Sachot 2007:61). In 1928 Métraux went to
Argentina, where he founded the Ethnological Institute at the University of Tucumân,
of which he was director for the following six years (d'Ans 1978:19f; Monnier
2003:9-14; Wagley 1964:603f; quoted in: Sachot 2007:61). He went on field-work
trips to the Chaco region. Northwest Argentina, and the Bolivian Altipiano. The data
on Uchumataqu (as well as on Chipaya) were collected during these years98. Alfred
Métraux committed suicide in Paris on April 11th 1963 (Sachot 2007:63).
      As other researchers of the late 19th and first half of the 20lh century, Métraux is
not very detailed about the background information of his field-work. That is, there is
no comment on whether Métraux employed an interpreter or which languages were
used in the process of data collection. However, as Sachot (2007:64) points out
Métraux was accompanied by an Aymara speaking interpreter when visiting the
community of Chipaya and we may therefore assume that he also had an interpreter
with him when studying Uchumataqu. It is also likely that the languages used during
the interviews were Spanish, Aymara, and Uchumataqu. It remains likewise unkown
with whom Métraux collected his data and the only note made about one of his
language consultants refers to ""[u]n vieil Indien"" (Métraux 1935:88). We know that
he must have worked with more than one person since Métraux mentions his
""informateurs uro"" (Métraux 1935:89). It can be inferred from his data that Métraux
worked with elderly people who were fully competent native speakers of
Uchumataqu. Although Métraux does not further specify the kind of relationship
between him and his language consultants, he mentions an unhappy incident that took
place during his stay. The two Bolivian soldiers, who accompanied Métraux to
Ancoaqui, became annoyed with some inhabitants of the village and threatened to
bum their houses (Métraux 1935:89). It is likely that this incident did not improve
matters for Métraux.
     Together with Posnansky, Métraux stayed in Ancoaqui for one week in June
1931 (Métraux 1935:75). It remained Métraux's only visit to the community. The
resulting article Contribution à l'ethnographie et à la linguistique des indiens Uro
d'Ancoaqui (Bolivie) was published in 1935, i.e. four years later. The language used
in the article is French.
     The article consists of an introduction with some notes on the literature
published so far on the Uchumataqu speakers and a brief report of the circumstances97
    Among his professors were well-known anthropologists of his time, as e g. Marcel Mauss and Paul
Rivet Métraux departed from university with a PhD degree, the topic of his work was the material culture
of the Tupi-Guarani.
98
    In the following years, Métraux became interested in areas outside South America and between 1948
and 1950, he carried out ethnographical research in Haiti (d'Ans 1978 21; quoted in: Sachot 2007:621) As
a result, Métraux published Le vaudou haïtien in 1958, which is one of his best known works, and for
which he became famous.
42                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
of Métraux's field trip (Métraux 1935:75, 76). The introduction is followed by a
detailed ethnographical description concerning the material culture: house types,
household goods, and tools as well as notes on the economic situation (hunting,
fishing, agriculture, livestock and cattle) (Métraux 1935:76-84). The following part
deals with the several uses of totora reeds, used for building rafts, plaits, and ropes
(Métraux 1935:84-86). A final section describes the clothing of the Uru (Métraux
1935:86f). On the next few pages Métraux (1935:87-89) is concerned with the social
and religious organisation of the Uru and also adds a brief section on their
""character"". The word list is preceded by some basic notes on the linguistic situation,
including a very brief comment on the phonological transcription system used (cf.
chapter 2). Métraux (1935:89) observes that the Uru would not use their ancient
language any more but spoke Aymara even among themselves. A somewhat
contradictory statement is that Métraux considered Uchumataqu to be ""purer""99 than
closely related Chipaya, which he explained by the fact that Ancoaqui and Irohito are
geographically close to important Uru centres of Lake Titicaca (ibid.). Métraux
supplies photos of Uchumataqu speakers and detailed drawings on tools and
household goods throughout his ethnographic description.
      The word list itself (Métraux 1935:90-110) is French-Uru and ordered
alphabetically. It contains 631 lexical items of all word classes, i.e. verbs from every
class, adjectives, adverbs of time, manner and degree as well as nouns. The latter
cover all possible semantic fields, as there are: body parts, kinship terms, clothing,
food, illness, tools and appliances, balsa rafts, domesticated and non-domesticated
animals as well as natural and astronomical phenomena. Métraux also provides
personal and interrogative pronouns, directional adverbs, short phrases of everyday
life, and numerals 1 to 23, 100, 1.000 and 10.000. However, Métraux made only very
basic grammatical observations, such as that e.g. -kin is a suffix meaning 'to, toward'
(Métraux 1935:109).
      Apart from a mere word list Métraux provides almost 200 additional explicative
clauses to the majority of his lexical data. These clauses and phrases aim to show the
use of a certain item in various contexts, e.g. in interrogative or imperative clauses.
Thus, we find eighteen clauses exemplifying the use of the verb 'to go'. Example
clauses occur with several kinds of lexemes, but particularly with the following
verbs: 'to have'100; 'to kill'; 'to hit, beat'; 'to come'; 'to put'; 'to see'; 'to make'; 'to
want'; 'to eat'; 'to leave'. The interrogative pronoun 'who?' is likewise explained in
greater detail. The example clauses are of varying length and complexity.
      Métraux's work is primarily a word list, which may be the reason why it has not
been considered for subsequent publications on Uchumataqu. That is, neither
LaBarre (1941), Palavecino (1949) nor Vellard (1949-67) mention it as a source of
their works and recent studies (e.g. Torero 2002) refer only to Uhle ( 1894), Lehmann
(1929), or Vellard but neglect Métraux's word list. Although Métraux's study on
Uchumataqu has always been underestimated, it contains highly valuable linguistic99
    Métraux does not explain what he means by ""purer"", but we may assume that it implies that
Uchumataqu was less influenced by Aymara, Quechua, and Spanish than Chipaya
100
    The notion of 'to have' is expressed by a construction involving benefactive -fail and the copulative
verb sel- 'to be'
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                                  43
(and ethnographic) information. As already mentioned above, his language
consultants must have been ftilly competent native speakers of Uchumataqu, to which
the complexity of several of the example clause points. Not only is the old
pronominal plural marker -wici present in Métraux's data, Métraux is, apart from
Uhle, the only researcher to report vocalisation (cf. 2.12.1.2). Almost all grammatical
interpretations obtained by an analysis of Métraux's example clauses are congruent
with Uhle's findings and can be verified by them. The lexical material provided by
Métraux agrees to a high proportion with the lexical data given by e.g. Lehmann
(1929b). It is a general observation that there is a gap between material recorded
before 1931 and material recorded after this time. This gap is found in the lexicon but
to a the larger degree it occurs with grammatical morphemes. That is, certain features
present in the documents from 1894 to 1935 are not found in Vellard's work, while
Vellard reports characteristics that seem to be of recent origin, since neither Uhle
(1894), Lehmann (1929), or Métraux (1935) mentions them.
      To conclude, I regard Métraux's material to be highly reliable and informative.
Together with Uhle's manuscript Métraux's data form 'core information' on
Uchumataqu. However, as other works of his time, Métraux's article shows the same
lack of information on his language consultants, languages used during the recording
process, and the general circumstances of his field-work. Furthermore, the time he
spent in Ancoaqui was rather short and he did not pay a second visit. From a present-
day point of view, this can be considered a significant failure in the process of data
collection.","[58, 59, 60]"

The first case to be discussed is hi-lay 'yes' (112a and b)

In contrast to modem Chipaya (Cerrón-Palomino 2006 109), which uses hee-za to
express positive confirmation, the sources on Uchumataqu (including Vellard) agree
on that the notion 'yes' is expressed by repetition of the verb form (cf 113a and b)

Although the Uchumataqu form hi-lay shows considerable similanty to its Chipaya
equivalent, it remains largely uncertain whether hi-lay is a regular form, under which
314
      Uchumataqu forms alphabetically ordered Slashes denote alternative forms

circumstances it could be used, and what the difference is between hi-lay and
repetition of the verb form.
      Next is isu-cay 'so, that' (Vellard 1949:151), which is probably a loan from
Spanish eso 'this, that' (cf. 2.11) and thus, we do not know whether the form ka:ya-
ca: (Uhle 1894:2) represents the original Uchumataqu expression. Furthermore, Uhle
did not specify whether this item is from Chipaya or Uchumataqu.
      Likewise uncertain is the use of sipi 'when, if, as given by Polo (1901:476).
Notions of mood and modality are usually expressed by irrealis -aca (cf. 5.8.2) and
thus, the use of a presumably unbound morpheme such as sipi appears to be striking.
It is possible that the first part is a loan from Spanish si meaning 'when, if335 but in
this case, the second element *-pi remains unanalysable. I would like to point to
Cuzco Quechua where a similar phenomenon can be observed. In this dialect,
Spanish si in its meaning 'when, if is combined with -chus which itself consists of
negation and question marking -chu and Reportative -s(i) (Cusihuamân 1976:248).
The resulting form sichus is likewise translated as 'when, if (cf. Valderrama and
Escalante 1977, Hannß 2004). However, since sipi is a single instance and its second
component remains elusive nothing further can be said about it.
      Another element to be discussed is somewhat exceptional to the previous ones
since wajasiki23*' 'that's why' comprises a form -siki which can be analysed as the
locative marker (cf. 4.1.1.3). The element *waja- does not occur elsewhere and we
may assume that wajasiki is lexicalised, provided it is a regular form of Uchumataqu
at all.
      Finally, Uhle (1894:113, 54.1) presents two particles related to Aymara. The
expression winaya 'always' is a direct loan from Aymara337 (DeLucca 1983:853)
while waligara, which is translated by Uhle as 'like'338, comprises the form wali
meaning 'well' or 'much' (DeLucca 1983:444). The form wali itself is used as an
adverb in Uchumataqu (cf. 6.1.4) but the element *-gara cannot be established for
neither Aymara nor Uchumataqu. The notion of comparative 'like' is expressed in
Aymara by the bound grammatical morpheme -jama (DeLucca 1983:606), whereas
Uchumataqu uses separative -kistana. Therefore, the form waligara remains largely
unanalysable. The remaining forms do not show any peculiarities or relations to other
bound or free morphemes.
      In what follows, I do not interpret the term 'phrase' in its syntactic sense but
rather in a pragmatic way, i.e. as a fixed expression that serves in daily
communication. As such, these phrases form a closed set. They are not a part of
speech as are e.g. adjectives but neither do they belong to a particular clause type (cf.
chapter 7) for they are fixed and do not allow much morphological or syntactic
variation. Therefore, these expressions are treated as a final remark on the parts of
speech Uchumataqu comprises.
      The majority of these phrases comes from Vellard (1949, 1951) and is thus
subject to the same source-related restrictions as are particles. Some of the phrases  It can also mean 'yes'
  As a quotation, the form waja- is maintained and not adopted to the Irohito alphabet
  Uhle points to this.
  Likewise for not specified for its origin Uhle himself is doubtful about the meaning of waligara.

cannot be analysed and most may be regarded as lexicalised. Furthermore, we lack a
context to these phrases and therefore, it remains largely unclear how they were used.

Some of these phrases are clearly analysable, e.g. ok^acay 'I will go' and in response
cunukasiì4ì 'alright' (Vellard 1951:20). Others can be understood only in part. This is
the case with e.g. cuni luxkucay wat cay 'thank you (for the meal)' (Vellard 1951:20)
where cuni luxkucay means 'I ate well' but the expression wat'cay remains elusive
(cf. Muysken 2005). The same is true for 'good evening' which is expressed as
sequese sincilita (Polo 1901:479). The first element sequese is reminiscent of the
word for 'evening' sericai or seheri (Polo 1901:476) but the form sincilita remains
uncertain342. Other forms that cannot be explained are kuntinsw, kal tinskucay, kam-
tun, and wa.ntuncay. It is possible that tun- of kam-tun and wa.ntuncay is related to
the verb stem tuna- or tona- meaning 'to come'. Provided these expressions are
indeed part of the Uchumataqu register of phrases, well-wishes, and greetings, it is
likely that they are lexicalised.
     The element -ay or -lay344 occurs on the respectful address for a superior person
appay or apây 'father', on epalai145 'good day', on cicalay used to greet a brother or
a person of equal rank. It may have inspired the interjection hay 'oh', as in hay
happay 'oh, father' (Vellard 1951:19) in response to happay. If the element -ay or
-lay has ever been a suffix of Uchumataqu it was not productive any more at the time
of documentation and it does not occur elsewhere. Although its exact meaning
therefore has to remain uncertain it seems justified to propose that it conveys the idea
of a respectful and polite address when attached to kinship terms. These terms, then,
may be considered to be an appropriate way of expressing politeness and respect
when dealing with a person one is not related to.
      Finally, the greeting exchanged between husband and wife should be mentioned.
The husband greets his wife with tun'una atto (Vellard 1951:20) which itself is not
translated by Vellard. The first element tun 'una shows considerable similarity with
the verb ton- 'to come' (Métraux 1935:109)346 while the second element atto is a
kinship term meaning 'mother'. In response the wife replies with wa.ntuncay apay
341
    The change of/i/ to /u/ on curnt- cannot be explained
342
    Métraux points to the similarity between the expression for 'good evening' and the word for 'evening'
sese.
343
    The element kun could be a form of second person singular. For further dicussion, cf. 4 2.5 1.1
344
    See also Polo (1901 481) who points out that male kinship terms end in -at
345
    Although Métraux translated this expression as 'good day' it is likely that it means the same as happay,
i e. 'father' in respectfully addressing a person of higher rank, epalai shows considerable similarity to the
kinship term ep '(biological) father'.
346
    Vellard does not mention the use of the verb ton- 'to come'
164                          UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
where wa.ntun- remains largely inexplicable except for the element -tun- which again
is reminiscent of'to come'. The term apay means 'father' as outlined above. That is,
the kinship terms of 'father' and 'mother' are used between husband and wife in
order to express politeness and respect347. This consideration gives further support to
the assumption that with respect to pragmatics kinship terms function as a polite
means to address people of equal or higher social rank. Thus, they have a scope
beyond the simple denotation of relationship.","[176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]"
"6.1.7 The adverbial use of affirmative -pini
Affirmative -pini is a loan from Aymara where it expresses affirmation (Porterie-
Gutiérrez 1981:33If) and can be translated as 'truly' or 'for sure'. It is a clausal clitic
(cf. 7.2.3). Uchumataqu adopted these functions and affirmative -pini occurs in all
adverbial subclasses appearing regularly on adverbs expressing degree. With time
adverbs and adverbs of location and direction, we may assume that the marker
signals Affirmation, as demonstrated in example (27).
(27)        laxk-cay5*6 hiya ipa-ka[si] ya[s]-pim-cay yak-aki-cay

            'At this very moment (lit.: truly now), it is quite loose; we will pull.'
                                                           (Vellard 1949:155)58785
    Provided -kacu is an instance ofpredicator -kasi, example (17) is in contrast to this finding since it is
not an attributive predicate clause. No suitable explanation can be given
586
    This term cannot be verified for sources other than Vellard.

With manner adverbs and adverbs expressing degree, affirmative -pini marks an
increased degree In this function, it can be translated as 'very', 'really' or, even more
extended, 'enormously' (cf examples (14), (20), and (23))
(28)      luwa luwa           luwa-pim-cay
          quick quick         quick-AFF-DEC
          'very quickly'      'very / really quickly'   (Vellard 1951 13)
Only in its affirmative function does affirmative -pint come close to what according
to Schachter (1985 20) signals the speaker's attitude towards the predication When it
occurs on manner adverbs or adverbs expressing degree, it looses this function and
becomes a mere way of increasing degree, which does not say anything about the
speaker's attitude
     With respect to word order, we find four possible positions the adverb can take
In most cases, it precedes the entire clause which may be regarded as the unmarked
position (pos 1) Another common and probably equally unmarked position is
preceding the verb, adverb, or adjective it modifies (pos 2) This position is in some
cases identical to the one preceding the entire clause The adverb can also appear at
the end of the clause which is less common than its position at the beginning (pos 3)
Accordingly, the adverb occurs sometimes after the item
it modifies although it does so less often (pos 4) Again, this position is in some
cases identical to the one following the entire clause In comparison to the position
preceding the modified item or entire clause, the position following it is possibly
marked in some way although it remains uncertain why or in what way it is marked
     There are only a few deviations from these positions We can only assume that
these deviations denote highly marked positions but it is impossible to provide
further explanations for the reason or meaning of these deviations6 2 Postpositions
In most languages, the distinction between case markers and adpositions is not
discreet one and the following definition is described as a ""[r]ule of thumb"" by Payne
(1997 100) However, I would like to adopt this definition for the following section
on postpositions
         Case marking is the morphosyntactic categorization of noun phrases that is
         imposed by the structure within which the noun phrase occurs Adpositions
         are free of such configurational constraints (Payne 1997 100)
Thus, adpositions may be seen as providing some additional semantic information on
the noun phrase they refer to and accordingly, are not required by verb semantics
     Adpositions in Uchumataqu are postpositions and some morphological features
help to clarify their status as postpositions To differing degrees, they are able to
combine with morphological markers other than clausal clitics which is not possible
for case markers In one case (see below), the postposition mora 'middle' follows a
case marker and it would be highly unusual for Uchumataqu to have two case markes
on one word In most case, a noun cames only one morphological marker (cf 3 2)
Only for huntani 'on, above' do we have to refer to Chipaya (Cerrón-Palomino
260                      UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
2006:141) since the expression does not provide any hints to its status, i.e. it could be
a case marker as well. However, huntani 'on, above' can be equated with the Chipaya
postposition huni 'on, above' and thus, we may assume that huntani in Uchumataqu
is a postposition, too.
      In Uchumataqu, we find four postpositions which are huntani 'on, above', kesu
'close to', mora 'middle', and kos 'inside'. Each of these will be presented below.6.2.1 huntani 'on, above'
The postposition huntani 'on, above' does not combine with other markers except for
declarative -cay.
(29)      wes       huntani-cay potsi

          'The knife is on the blanket.'                          (Uhle 1894:64)
It is possible that huntani consists of a stem *hun followed by locative marker -ta (cf.
4.1.1.4) and an element -ni. The latter may be in some way related to the subject
relativiser -ni but it is not the marker itself since locative -ta already is a nominal
suffix. However, the postposition huntani probably was lexicalised at the time of its
documentation and thus, has to be considered a lexeme.6.2.2 kesu 'close to '
The postposition kesu is translated as 'close to'.
(30)      oeisa    kesu       kuasi-cay
          sheep    close to water-DEC
          'The sheep is close to the water.'                      (Métraux 1935:105)

          village-little close to-DEC
          'The little village is close.'                          (Muysken 2005:26)
It can be combined with predicator -kasi and declarative -cay. It is particularly
predicator -kasi that confirms the status of kesu as a postposition since a case marker
cannot appear in a predicative position, such as shown in example (32).
(32)      kesu-kaci-cay
          close tO-PRE-DEC
          'It is close.'                                          (Vellard 1951:14)6.2.3 mora 'middle'
The postposition mora means 'middle' and no example is found where it is combined
with other morphological markers. However, since huntani 'on, above' and kesu
'close to' can be combined with at least declarative -cay, we may assume that mora,
too, can be followed by clausal clitics.
CHAPTER 6 - ADVERBS, POSTPOSITIONS AND NEGATION                                                           261

            'In the middle of the village, there is a / the church.'              (Uhle 1894:68.2)
Although mora is a postposition, there is one case in which it precedes the noun it
refers to. It is uncertain whether this reversed order is highly marked or due to
language attrition.
(34)        mora     lyiksi-kina tsi:t-aki-cay
            middle road-DlR place-FU-DEC
            'We will place ourselves onto the middle of the road.' (Uhle 1894:17)
The following example confirms that mora is a postposition and not a case marker.
(35)        //' tapa        cufkij    xin-kinfaj ya-ki        maska-kifnaj mora
            this pepper we            stock-DlR put-TOP pot-DlR              middle
            'Let us put this pepper into the stock, into the pot in the middle.'
                                                                      (Métraux 1935:101)
As shown in the example clause, the form mora follows the directional case marker
-kina which would be impossible if mora itself was another case marker.6.2.4kos 'inside'
The last postposition to be discussed is kos 'inside'. With respect to morphology, kos
differs to a certain degree from the other postpositions in that it can be combined with
nominal markers, such as directional locative -ski and locative -ta. This is a proof that
kos indeed is postpositional in nature.
(36)        wir-i-l       kui     kos-ta                 ikan-s-n-a-cay

            'I will stay inside the house.'                                (Vellard 1967:30)
Postposition kos also combines with the form -carku '-wards' (cf. 6.1.2, and example
(10)).
(37)        kos-carku
            inside-AD
            'inside'                                                              (Métraux 1935:95)
In the following example, the meaning of kos is slightly changed to 'under'. This
becomes explicable if the table is viewed as a square with the legs forming its sides
and thus, building a closed space.

    Person reference is based on Uhle's translation. It is uncertain whether this clause comes from Chipaya
or Uchumataqu.

    The use of object marker -n is somewhat sinking here. It is possible that it reflects the locative object,
in the sense of 'stay in it (= house)'

The morpheme ana negates entire clauses as well as noun, verb, pronominal, and
adjectival phrases, i.e. it can occur with all parts of speech. It has several translations
depending on the context. According to the morphological markers or lexemes ana
can be combined with, four categories can be distinguished. They will be presented
below.
     The basic meaning of ana is 'no' or 'not' and in this function, the negation
appears either without any morphological marking at all (example 40) or combines
with clitic elements (41). However, in most cases, ana is not marked at all.

With respect to its position, ana almost always precedes the element it negates, i.e. it
appears either at the beginning of the entire clause or precedes the phrase it refers to.
Sometimes the position at the beginning of a clause coincides with the one preceding
the negated phrase (e.g. example 40). Only in one case does ana appear at the end of
a clause and there, it is used to build a tag question. Since the construction in (43) is
the only one of this type found in the sources, it is impossible to state whether it is a

regular construction and what its exact meaning is. However, we may assume that the
position of ana is marked in some way in order to form the tag question.

When the negation is inflected with affirmative -pini, the meaning of ana extends to
'never', thereby reflecting the affirmative sense of -pini. Thus, -pini rules out the
basic meaning of ana. Affirmative -pini itself can be combined with declarative -cay.

In one instance, ana is inflected with certainty -kala (cf. 5.9) which takes a position
normally reserved for affirmative -pini since certainty -kala is a verbal and
affirmative -pini a clausal clitic.

            ('ku-ya tax-cay sax-r-kicay hana Kala c/'-cwna') (Vellard 1949:166)
Since affirmative -pini is a more recent loan from Aymara (Porterie-Gutiérrez
1981:331f), its occurence is limited to the works of Vellard (1949-67) and Muysken
(2005) (cf. 7.2.3). In all cases, the emphasised negative expression ana-pini- precedes
the item it refers to.
      So far, morphological processes have been discussed. The following will deal
with lexical processes involving negative morpheme ana. It can be combined with
indefinite pronouns in order to build negative indefinite pronouns595 (see 4.2.4). It
occurs with hek 'who' (only attested for Uhle 1894), culu or ci-culu 'something'596,
cila 'another', and the lexical expression ti suni 'this man'. Depending on the
indefinite pronoun, the resulting expression means either 'no one, nobody', 'nothing',
or 'not one'. Although negative ana can be inflected with clausal and personal clitics
(examples 46, 47), its scope is over the indefinite pronoun, i.e. an expression as e.g.
ana-pini hek means 'certainly no one' and not 'never one' (example mine). Thus, the
combination of ana and an indefinite pronoun rules out the meaning a clausal clitic
has on the negation on its own (example 47). The indefinite pronouns themselves can
take nominal or clausal clitics but in most cases they are not marked at all.","[275, 276, 277, 278, 279, 280]"
"1.4.2.3.1 Manuscript from Ancoaqui (fair copy)
As Lehmann states in the fair copy, he visited Ancoaqui on October 12th 1929 and
made the fair copy the following day in La Paz, which means he spent only one day
in the community79. The fair copy consists of 26 pages80 with 453 entries, which are
mainly lexical. Until p. 21 Lehmann provides only nouns and adjectives, which cover
several semantic fields. It is noteworthy that the nouns refer mainly to concrete
objects, such as e.g. 'house', 'broom', 'knee', etc., although Lehmann also reports
kinship terms, such as 'brother-/sister-in-law' and some terms designating religious
phenomena, such as 'soul'. These purely lexical entries are followed on pages 21 and
22 by the numerals 1 to 10, 20 and 100, the personal pronouns, and a possessive
paradigm exemplified by the word 'house'. On pages 23 and 24 Lehmann presents
the drawing of a traditional Andean loom and ten Uchumataqu terms referring to its
parts. It is only on the last two pages (p. 25, 26) of his manuscript that Lehmann
gives some grammatical information. This consists of conjugations of the verbs 'to
be' and 'to give' and although the latter is supposed to be transitive, we find no
object expressed, i.e. Lehmann asked for 'I give', 'you give' and so on. He also
presents the forms 'I was', 'I am not', and 'I was not', which are single entries
without full paradigms. Page 25 also contains what appears to be a repetition of the
possessive paradigm presented on p. 22. On the last page Lehmann supplies the
intransitive form 'I die' and four examples of the transitive verb 'to kill': 'I kill you',
'you kill me', 'he kills me', and 'I kill him'.
     The following unnumbered page shows Lehmann's hypothesis about a possible
genetic relationship between Uchumataqu and Atacameno81 and correspondingly, he
presents a comparative word list of 46 lexemes of these two languages on another
two pages (A and B). On the following two pages (a and ß) Lehmann compares

Uchumataqu with Mochica but points out that it has to be considered a ""preliminary
attempt""82 (Lehmann 1929b, a, translation mine). This list consists of 26 lexical items
as well as the numerals 5 and 6. Lehmann does not mention his sources for the
Atacameno and Mochica terms but the Uchumataqu terms must be from Ancoaqui
since Lehmann produced the list on October 13th 1929 in La Paz, i.e. two weeks
before he visited Ch'imu. However, he must have returned later to this material since
the lists are followed by a final remark, in which Lehmann explains that further
research on the Puquina texts of Ore is required to clarify the linguistic situation at
the northern coast of Peru. The note is dated April 24th 1931.
       Lehmann uses Spanish in his manuscript with the exception of the introduction
and the description of the loom and its parts. However, Lehmann did not speak
Quechua or Aymara, as becomes apparent in the introduction to the Ch'imu
manuscript (Lehmann 1929d:ii)83. Since the Uchumataqu speakers did not understand
Spanish, Lehmann needed an interpreter to communicate with them (Lehmann
1929b:i)8'1. He describes the interview situation as follows: ""Using my synoptical
word lists the conversation with the Uru was pursued by the interpreter in Spanish,
Aymara, and Quechua.""85 (Lehmann 1929b:i). The interpreter (Lehmann 1929d:ii)86
is described as speaking not only Spanish but also Aymara and Quechua fluently.
However, some confusion arises with respect to the names and numbers of
interpreters actually involved. As Lehmann mentions on the first page to the
Ancoaqui manuscript (and repeats in the more detailed introduction to the Ch'imu
manuscript) he was accompanied by only one interpreter, but on the second page he
gives the names of two men he refers to as interpreters: Chunak kasi and Mariano
Kispe87. However, on p. 23 / 43488 Lehmann declares Suma Ch'ufiak kasi to be the
alleged name of his main language consultant. Lehmann does not further clarify the
situation of interpreters and language consultants involved, but I suppose that there
has been a misunderstanding since cuna-kasi is an Uchumataqu expression meaning
'it is well' or in the case of suma cuna-kasi 'it is very well'89. It is thus probable that
Lehmann interpreted as a name what in fact was only an agreement uttered by one of
his consultants. Lehmann himself seems to have mistrusted the statement of his
language consultant as he refers to it as the alleged name. Apart from these not
entirely clear notes Lehmann does not provide further specifications on his language
consultants or interpreter and their personal backgrounds. However, since Lehmann
refers to Chunak kasi as his ""main informant"" we may assume that other persons
were involved too. We do not know what kind of relationship there was between

87
    Posnansky (1934 264) lists the names of Manano Kispe (sen ) and Manano Kispe (jun ) and it is thus

Lehmann and his language consultant(s) and given the short time Lehmann spent in
Ancoaqui it further seems doubtful whether there was any particular relationship at
all. However, according to Lehmann the Uchumataqu speakers were sympathetic
about the interview situation and encouraged him to learn their language. This
remained his only visit.
     Taking this into consideration as well as the fact that most of Lehmann's data
are lexical, we find them less suitable for a grammatical description. However, when
compared to other sources, the vast majority of Lehmann's lexemes can be verified,
which is also true for his basic grammatical observations. As Uhle and Polo,
Lehmann visited Ancoaqui at a time when fully competent native speakers of
Uchumataqu were apparently still alive. This is reflected in his data, which contain
elements that cannot be found in later documents, e.g. the pronominal plural marker -
wici. Thus, the data provided by Lehmann can be judged reliable but less appropriate
for a grammatical description since they are mainly lexical.","[53, 54, 55]"

In possessive predicate clauses -kistana is used to mark a question for the possessor:
(21)        ti ckal-kstan(i) hek-ta                 duenu-ki
            this field-SEP who-QM                   owner-TOP

This function is limited to interrogative clauses since possession is otherwise
expressed by either the possessive suffix -/ (only first person singular) or by word
order (possessor-possessed) (cf. 4.1.2 and 4.2.2). Whereas it does not seem to be a
common function of the separative, we find a rather frequent use of -kistana in
interrogative clauses. There, it is attached to the basic interrogative pronoun culu-
'what' to form the more specific cul-k(i)sta 'why' (lit: 'what from?').
(23)        cul-ksta am am-k(i) pis-cay
            what-SEP you you-TOP come-DEC
            'Why do you come?'                                            (Uhle 1894:23)

Separative -kistana is also employed to mark a temporal separative as in culura-si-
kstafni/66, 'since when?'.
(25)        culuras-fkisjtani am sel am-ki        (Hanqohaqe)

At last, separative -kistana is also applied in comparisons between two entities.
(26)       wir-ki am-ksta(na) yuk     q'a:-ci:-cay
           I-TOP you-SEP        much money-POS-DEC

           (\..yukq^äcïca,)                          (Uhle 1894:71)
As can be expected -kistana appears most often with motion verbs like ol- or ul(an)-
'leave', pic- 'come', and ox- 'go'. Another use of separative -kistana is with verbs
that express an inherent direction, like resiw?61 'receive'. However, in the majority
of cases -kistana is employed in either interrogative or possessive clauses.
     Separative -kistana appears in a lexicalised constructions as nekstani or nikstam
'then, afterwards', where a demonstrative pronoun ni 'that' has been combined with -
kistana, literally 'that away from'. The form nekstani is limited to express a temporal
adverb.

           I-LV-CL=1   then gO-FU-DEC
           'Then [afterwards] I will go.'                        (Vellard 1967:31)
Separative -kistana shows a great variety of different forms, which range from
-kistana to forms like -tam, -stam/n, or -sta. However, no phonological,
morphological, or syntactic rules can be shown to determine their distribution.
Therefore they have to be considered as mere alternative forms, probably due to rapid
speech.","[187, 188, 189]"

"2.1 Sources and background information
For the temporal frame chosen for the current study, no recorded material is
available135 and therefore, a phonological description of Uchumataqu necessarily has
to rely on written material. This material consists of the following works: Uhle
(1894), manuscript; Polo (1901), published word list; Lehmann (1929), manuscripts;
Métraux (1935), published word list with entire clauses; Vellard (1949-67), published
word lists, clauses, and entire conversations136. There is considerable variation among
the sources: Uhle, Lehmann, and Vellard use different phonetic transcription systems
in their works, whereas Polo employs mainly the Spanish alphabet and Métraux has a
somewhat simplicised phonetic transcription137. Thus, Uhle, Lehmann, and Vellard
offer a detailed phonological description of Uchumataqu with several diacritics to
further specify a certain sound, while Polo and Métraux are less detailed. Although
all authors provide a short explanation as to which transcription system they employ
or what a certain symbol means, these explanations are by no means exhaustive nor
do they cover all the symbols actually used in a transcription, or are sometimes even
contradictory. Furthermore, Uhle, Lehmann, and Vellard do not use the same
transcription systems in their works. Obviously because Uhle and Lehmann are from
a German tradition and Vellard is from a French school. Thus, I had to rely in part on
external sources in order to interpret and analyse sounds and symbols not described
by the authors themselves. These external sources are Schmidt, Die Sprachlaute und
ihre Darstellung in einem allgemeinen linguistischen Alphabet (1907), who gives a
broad and detailed overview of the European transcription conventions used at this
time. This proves particularly valuable for an analysis of Uhle's and Lehmann's data.
For Lehmann's manuscripts, I also rely on one of his earlier publications, Die
Sprachen Zentral-Amerikas in ihren Beziehungen zueinander sowie zu Süd-Amerika
und Mexiko (1920), where Lehmann provides an explanation of the sounds and
symbols used in transcription, which are also found in his manuscripts from 1929. As
mentioned by Bacaueza in Proyecto de alfabeto para Escribir la Lengua Aymara
([1910] 1957), Uhle was among those scholars who put forward an Aymara alphabet
and it is likely that he used a similar transcription in his manuscript (1894) of the
Uchumataqu language. The French transcription tradition is covered by Meillet and135
    The film about the Uru made by Vellard (1951, cf 14 2 5 3) actually contains audio material on
Uchumataqu However, the quality of the material is such that it s not suitable for a phonological analysis
Furthermore, the audio material in the film is rather limited and it is doubtful whether it would be
sufficient for a phonological analysis
""""Bacarreza ([1910] 1957), Posnansky (1934), LaBarre (1941), and Palavecino (1949) are considered
only to a minor degree since they provide mainly ethnographic information with only a few words in their
texts The transcription system used by them is that of Polo, i.e. it resembles the Spanish alphabet
137
    According to the author, it is based on Rivet and Crequi-Montfort (1925-27)
58                            UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
Cohen, Les Langues du monde (1952), where the authors provide a comprehensive
insight into the relevant French transcription conventions. The modem International
Phonetic Alphabet (IPA, as presented in Clark and Yallop 1995; 1996) is only
considered when it gives further support to a statement based on the sources
mentioned above. The same is true for Cerrón-Palomino's grammar of Chipaya, El
chipaya o la lengua de los hombres del agua (2006).
     The contribution of the external sources to the analysis and interpretation of the
symbols used in the manuscripts is as follows: Although Lehmann does not classify
e.g. <r> in his manuscripts, he defines an identical symbol as a prepalatal dental in
his work from 1920. Since Lehmann uses almost identical transcription systems in
both studies, we may assume that the description from 1920 also applies to the
symbol used in the manuscript from 1929. In other cases, more interpretation is
required. The symbol <]> as used by Vellard (1949-67) is not explained by the
researcher himself, but a definition of an identical symbol is found in Meillet and
Cohen (1952:xiii), where it is described as a prepalatal lateral. The symbol <]>
occurs in the same word (xil'i 'meat') as the symbol <Γ>, which is used by Métraux
(1935) and classified as ""[...] the «11» or palatalised 1 of the same language [i.e.
Spanish].""138 (translation mine). Thus, we know that a) <]> represents a prepalatal
lateral and b) that it can be equated with Métraux's symbol <Γ>, which characterises
<11>. On the basis of these considerations it is possible to say that Vellard's symbol
<1> corresponds to what in modem Spanish ortography is represented by <11>. Thus,
when <]> is defined as a prepalatal or palatal lateral, the interpretation is mine and
not provided by Vellard himself. It is thus important to point out that the general
interpretation of symbols is mine unless indicated otherwise.","[74, 75]"

It can be attached to all verb classes and no suffixes preceding In-Group marker -acu
are found. Instead it is attached directly to the verb stem and frequently followed by
declarative -cay4m. The allomorph of In-Group marker -acu is -asu which is the form
found in Métraux (22). In the work of Vellard, -acu and -asu alternate.

5.1.4 Past tense markers -u and -ku
Although the sources offer satifactory data on future and present tense, the data on
past tense are fragmentary and often confusing. However, it is possible to single out
two different verbal past tense markers, which are -u and -ku, but there are analytical
problems. One reason why the data, particularly on -ku, are confusing is that it also
functions as a subordination marker (see 5.7.1). However, a distinction is made by
the application of declarative -cay. For subordination, the subordinate verb takes -ku,
while the finite verb is inflected with declarative -cay. This means that a verb
inflected with -ku and bearing the declarative marks past tense instead of
subordination. Due to the crucial difference the use of -cay makes, we may assume
that it is obligatory for past tense verbs to take the declarative in order to be
understood as past marking forms. With respect to morphemes preceding -u, we find
subject marker -s and and object marker -n (23, 24) (cf. 5.1.1).

CHAPTER 4 - THE NOMINAL SYSTEM                                                       173
Only a few instances of terminative -kama are found throughout the sources on
Uchumataqu and it is only in Vellard's data (1949-1967) that we find a more frequent
use of it. Terminative -kama is attached to nouns and temporal adverbs and forms
part of the nominal system. Like other case markers -kama attaches directly to the
stem and is not followed by any other morphemes.
      It has to be noted that from the different functions -kama fulfils in Aymara and
Quechua (tab. 4.5) only a limited aspect has been adopted by Uchumataqu, namely
the terminative function in time. Therefore, -kama is translated as 'until' (but only in
a temporal sense), '(mean)while', or 'during'. As can be expected from this, we find -
kama attached only to nouns or adverbs expressing a temporal aspect.
(28)      uskatan-kama

          'in a moment, in an instant'                      (Métraux 1935:101)

          'Until when will you stay (fishing)?'             (Uhle 1894:68.2)
As can be seen from the examples (28-30), terminative -kama expresses two temporal
concepts (as it also does in Aymara and Quechua), which are considered distinct in
Indo-European languages. First, it describes the notion of 'until', i.e. an event with
some (unknown) starting point, but with a fixed end point from where on another
event takes place. 'During' and '(mean)while' rather mark two events being parallel
for at least some time; starting and end point are of no importance here.
With regard to vowel elision or other processes of deleting phonological segments we
hardly find any evidence for that with terminative -kama whereas most Uchumataqu
morphemes show a relatively great range of phonetic reductions e.g. -ki for Allative -
kina or -stan for separative -kistana. A possible explanation might be the status of
terminative -kama as a borrowed morpheme.
      In Aymara the suffix has two different shapes: -kama and -kam, depending on
the number of syllables in the root (Hardman et al. 1986:217, Huayhua Pari
2001:258f). Since Aymara as the providing language offers only the forms of -kama
and -kam the borrowing language Uchumataqu maintains them and does not show the
usual reduction in phonetic shape (to e.g. *-ka).

          'Until tomorrow.'                                 (Vellard 1951:20)
It is not entirely certain how a locational notion of the terminative is expressed, but
there is evidence that is done by the use of the interrogative pronoun xas 'where', as
demonstrated by the following example.

The clause is unmarked for its origin, but possibly comes from Uchumataqu due to its
content. There is evidence in Uhle (1894) that -kama is used to mark a locational
terminative but the examples presented are not marked for their origin and the
evidence it not flirter supported by other sources on Uchumataqu.

Table 4.6: Translation possibilities of terminative -kama4.1.2 Possession     and     beneficiary
Uchumataqu has several means to express possession. As a syntactic means it
employs the juxtaposition of either possessive pronoun and possessed noun (cf. 4.2.2)
or of two nouns. The regular word order is possessor-possessed.
(33)        paku-kurus
            dog-tail
            'the dog's tail; a dog-tail'                            (Métraux 1935:105)
This may be called primary possession since it is the most immediate way to express
possession and no stress is put onto either participant.
      Apart from syntactic ways there are also morphological means to mark
possession. One is the inflection with possessive -ci (cf. 4.1.2.1) which functions to
stress the possessor. In an extended meaning benefactive -taki expresses the idea that
'X exists for Y' (cf. 4.1.2.2). In this case, the beneficiary relationship between two
entities is stressed. Finally, separative -kistana is sometimes used to express a part-
whole relation in that a possessive construction with -kistana can be literally
translated as 'the X from Y' (cf. 4.1.1.5). These morphological means to express
possession may be called secondary possession since they either stress the possessor
or the possessed or mark a special relationship between the two entities.","[189, 190, 191]"
"4.3.3 Predicator -kasi
Predicator -kasi is attached to adjectives as well as to adverbs. A word must be said
on adverbs. Adverbs inflected with -kasi are treated here under the heading of
'adjectives'. The predicator -kasi is an element that distinguishes nouns from
adjectives and therefore places adverbs nearer to the adjectival space, so adverbs
inflected with the predicator are discussed together with adjectives (cf. 6.1.3 to
6.1.5). The reason -kasi is not treated as an adverbial suffix is that its most important
task is the predication of adjectives. Therefore, -kasi is viewed as an adjectival
435
  At least theoretically we may assume that adverbs in adjectival predicate clauses are free in position as
well, but no examples for another ordering can be found.
202                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
element.436. Since -kasi serves to build predications it does not appear on an
attributive element. Predicator -kasi is directly attached to the adjectival or adverbial
stem and is not followed by any other morpheme than declarative -cay (144). It is
best translated with a form of 'to be'.

As was mentioned in the introductory section on adjectives, -kasi is not obligatorily
used in predications. We do not find predicator -kasi in constructions built with
demonstrative pronoun ti 'this'.
(140)          inawis          uca-cay      ti-ki
               rather/quite small-DEC this-TOP

Another common use of predicator -kasi is in single-word utterances438.
(141)          cuna-kasi419
               gOOd-PRE
               'it is sweet' (lit: 'good')                                       (Métraux 1935:95)
There are, however, cases in which it is not entirely clear why a certain marking is
chosen. We find three possibilities: ADJ-DEC (142), ADJ-0 (143), and ADJ-PRE (141).
(142)          yuk-si       kanu-cay*0

    There are, however, a few cases where -kasi is attached to nominal elements. These cases are not
entirely clear and are therefore considered as misrepresentations. In the majority of cases predicator -kasi
is found only on adjectives and adverbs.
437
    puka probably denves from aymara phokana 'completar / [ .] cumplir' (DeLucca 1983352) as does
resultative -ta (Porterie-Gutiérrez 1981 117). Vellard ( 1951:13) points to that.
    We may also assume that elicitation promotes the use of -kasi on single words since the native speaker
adds predicator -kasi to his / her utterance in order to make it a complete statement
439
    The change of final vowel l\l to /a/ cannot be explained.
440
    As Métraux (ibid) points out q 'anu is a loan from Aymara.
CHAPTER 4 - THE NOMINAL SYSTEM                                                          203

               'The year is dry; thus the potatoes do not grow.' (Vellard 1949:151)
The choice of either declarative -cay, predicator -kasi, or zero marking cannot be
explained, but we may assume that the use of -kasi emphasises the statement.
Predicator -kasi has an allomorphe -kaci but the form most often used is -kasi.
( 144)         eo-kaci-cay
               new-PRE-DEC

Uhle (1894:64.2) suggests that -kasi is a borrowed element which consists of the
verbal stem ka- 'to be'441 and Aymara Reflexive -si. He translates -kasi as 'to be him-
/her-Zitself ('sich sein' ibid). It is doubtful whether ka- really derives from a verbal
stem since in this case a connecting element was needed for -kasi to attach to an
adjectival stem and no such element can be proven. There is, on the other hand, the
Aymara suffix -ka which is used to build predications. But it does not lend itself so
well for an explanation, either, since its use is restricted to locative clauses (Porterie-
Gutiérrez 1981:89).
     It has to remain uncertain whether -kasi consists of borrowed morphemes or
whether it is an Uchumataqu suffix which only by coincidence shows similarities
with Aymara and Quechua elements. But even if it is a loan it is completely
grammaticalised in Uchumataqu and is treated as a genuine suffix of this language.
     The following list contains all Uchumataqu lexemes from the sources that are
encoded as adjectives. They are ordered corresponding to the semantic fields that
according to Dixon (1982:13) are likely to be expressed as adjectives. Items
underlined are attested by only one author. If a word is a loan from Aymara,
Quechua, or Spanish, this is indicated in parentheses: (Aym.), (Que.), (Span.).","[218, 219, 220]"

   The subject of his thesis was a particular aspect of medieval Chinese grammar (Rowe 1954:1) Stations

working as an assistant in 1888
30                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
Uhle stayed in Irohito between 23rd August and lsl September 1894 (Uhle 1894 m.s.
Chronologie meiner Erfahrungen57:!) and for all we know, this was his only visit to
the community. He does not provide the name of his language consultant but only
refers to him as ""at least one who taught me his language, in spite of his fellows""58
(Uhle 1896:19, translation mine). That is, the Uchumataqu data collected by Uhle
stem from one single speaker and except for the fact that he was male nothing further
is said about him. Neither does Uhle specify the personal relationship to his language
consultant, although he twice mentions him as his ""teacher"" (Uhle 1894:3, 89.1).
However, we do not know whether he refers to his visit to Irohito or Huachacalla.
      With respect to his language skills, Max Uhle spoke Spanish but probably
hardly any Aymara59 at the time he visited Irohito and it was only after his trip to
Irohito that Uhle became more acquainted with Aymara (cf. Rowe 1954:106).
Although he mentions an interpreter for his studies on Chipaya (Uhle 1896:331)60,
we find no unequivocal hint to an interpreter for his trip to Irohito. Only once does
Uhle (1894:82, translation mine) remark upon ""an interpreter speaking a second
Indian language""61 but it remains uncertain whether he refers to his study on Chipaya
or Uchumataqu. However, it seems justified to assume that Uhle was dependent upon
an interpreter in Irohito as well. Thus, the languages used in the process of data
collection must have been Uchumataqu, Aymara, and Spanish.
      The Uchumataqu data have never been published and are thus available only as
a manuscript, which, as part of Uhle's academic legacy, is in the possession of the
Ibero-Amerikanisches Institut in Berlin. The manuscript is handwritten in what is
today an old-fashioned script called Siitterlin and with a few exceptions Uhle uses
German throughout his notes.
      The part of the manuscript that is of importance here is the grammar of
Uchumataqu and Chipaya called ""Basic outline of an Uro grammar"" (Grundzüge
einer Uro-Grammatik). It consists of 117 single and double pages, some of which are
not numbered, in which case I cite them as e.g. 64.1. Here, 64 refers to the last page
number Uhle used, while . 1 indicates that it is the first unnumbered page after this;
correspondingly, 64.2 would refer to the second unnumbered page following p. 64.
      Although the first section in Uhle's manuscript is about the language of Irohito,
the manuscript itself is concerned with both varieties, i.e. Uhle treats Uchumataqu
and Chipaya and melts them into one grammatical description. He often indicates
where he obtained a particular piece of information from or which variety a statement
refers to, but does not consistently do so. In some cases, he points to differences
between the two varieties. However, Uhle deals with every aspect of the language
and his manuscript is thus an entire grammar of Uru-Chipaya. Although Uhle
collected a considerable number of sentences and more than 600 words in Irohito
 (Uhle 1896:19), his grammar does not contain texts but single sentences. These are
transcribed according to the phonological transcription conventions of Uhle's time

(cf. chapter 2) and therefore the data convey not only grammatical but also
phonological information. As it was common in the late 19th century, Uhle used a
Latin-based model for his grammar, which particularly with respect to the verbal
system led to a certain frustration on the researcher's part:
        While recording the language I tried several times to conjugate a short verbal
        phrase through the different tenses but all I got was that with every person I
        received an entirely new tense changing the entire meaning of the sentence,
        [...]. Particularly the answers on tense were always the most unsatisfactory.
        Some of these answers I had to correct by cross-checking two, three times but
        did not always succeed. (Uhle 1894:84, translation mine)62
Uhle also compares his results to Aymara referring to the grammar of Middendorf
(1891), observing similarities and differences and repeatedly pointing to the
increasing Aymara influence on Uchumataqu.
     From Uhle's difficulties to describe the verbal system a certain bias results
towards the nominal and pronominal system of the language: it is by far the most
elaborate section and an almost complete description of the nominal and pronominal
aspects of Uru-Chipaya. In comparison, the verbal system is less detailed and as
indicated in the quotation above, Uhle is concerned mainly with the tense system,
while he is less interested in e.g. aspectual features. Furthermore, most of the data
exemplifying the verbal system seem to come from Chipaya. Other parts of the
language are treated equally briefly, e.g. postpositions, clausal markers, and adverbs.
Each of these topics receives only a few pages' treatment. In the following I give a

Furthermore, Uhle's manuscript also contains some notes concerning his journey,
and anthropological observations. They are considered for the current work only to a
minor degree.
-     a list of the clauses he collected in Irohito and Huachacalla66 (30 double pages)
      a word list comparing Uchumataqu and Chipaya (six single pages)
-     another word list where Uhle compares his data to those collected by Polo67,
      with a Spanish translation; personal notes by Uhle (24 single pages)
-     a comparative word list labelled 'Uro and Puquina', but which actually contains
      an Uru-German vocabulary (9 pages)
-     a brief word list Spanish-Atacamefio with some notes by Uhle (three pages)
-     a list of words and clauses from Chipaya (24 single pages)
-     some notes and preliminary grammatical interpretations; possibly in preparation
      of the grammar (23 single pages)
 -    detailed notes on his journey, personal experiences, as well as anthropological
      and archaeological observations (all in all 77 pages)
 -    grammatical relations between Quechua and Aymara (one page)
      catechism ('Doctrina Cristiana') in Aymara and Spanish (17 double pages) ""
We find personal notes and comments made by Uhle throughout his manuscript.
Some of them were clearly made while collecting the data, whereas others were
probably added afterwards. They enable us to get an insight into the way Uhle
obtained and treated his information, something he himself does not further specify.
Thus, Uhle reports the expression tsi: wa.sa 'once' but remarks: ""The Indian gave me
tsi u.nu, but u.nu is probably Spanish WHO!""68 (Uhle 1894:33, translation mine). That
is, Uhle does not use the expression his language consultant provided but what he65
   Which is expressed by the copulative verb sel - 'to be' and benefactive -taki
66
   These clauses are repeated from his grammar
67
   Since Polo visited Irohito in 1897, it seems that this list must have been added some time after Uhle
returned from South America
68
   ""der Indiër gab mir tsi u nu an, aber u mi wird = uno span sein1""

considered to be appropriate. It is not unlikely that this happened with other entries,
too, even if Uhle does not mark them as 'corrected'. A similar process can be
observed with the use of parenthesis, as e.g. on -kin(a) 'to, towards' (Uhle 1894:11).
Although Uhle does not explain when and why he uses parenthesis, it is likely that
they mark elements that were not realised due to e.g. elision but which Uhle
considers to be necessary.
     When it comes to an evaluation of the manuscript, we have to take into
consideration that Uhle spent only a short time in Irohito, worked only with one
language consultant, whose background remains unknown, he probably needed an
interpreter speaking Aymara and Spanish, and possibly changed some of his data to
what he considered appropriate. However, despite these restrictions Uhle's work can
be regarded as one of the most important documents on Uchumataqu. Not only was
he the first researcher ever to collect any linguistic data, but he also documented
Uchumataqu when it was still a spoken language, although already endangered. His
description of the nominal and pronominal system is supported by following works
and even modem studies on the closely related Chipaya (cf. Cerrón-Palomino 2006)
confirm his findings. In conclusion, Uhle's manuscript contains highly valuable
information on Uchumataqu.","[46, 47, 48, 49, 50]"
"1.3.6 Irohito 2006: Fieldwork and language consultants
That was very much the situation when I visited Irohito between February 15th and
20th 2006. On my first day in the community, a workshop was held, titled Taller de
Complementación, which sought to find out about the most pressing needs of Andean
rural communities. According to the results, a five-year-planification should be
developed. High on the Urus' list was electrification41, fish farming to ensure a
regular nutrition, and tourism. Most participants of the the workshop agreed to use
only native species of fish for farming, such as e.g. Mauri, Karachi, and Suchi,
instead of breeding introduced species, such as trout. This fish farming should not
only ensure a regular nutrition of the inhabitants themselves, but was also planned to
play a role in tourism by offering local specialities. The making of totora42 crafts,
such as totora rafts, hats, etc. should be promoted, in order to sell them to tourists.
Furthermore, these traditional crafts should also become a subject at school. During
my stay, virtually the entire community was engaged in building traditional round
houses, two of which were already completed and another two were being thatched.
They were thought to be tourist accomodations and, given that Irohito is a small rural
community on the poor Bolivian Altipiano, had an astonishing amount of comfort.
      Despite this positive development, the community of Irohito suffers from the
flaws of almost every rural Altipiano village. That is, most of the young people move
away to La Paz or sometimes even leave Bolivia entirely to find work in
neighbouring Argentina. At present there are only seven children of age thirteen or
fourteen left, and they cannot attend school in Irohito but have to go to Corpa (about
12 kilometres away). There are 32 families living in the village. The economy of
Irohito is still centred around hunting and fishing, but there are less fish in the river
since more people than ever rely on it. That is, today also neighbouring Aymara
communities go fishing on the Desaguadero River and this puts considerable pressure
on the fragile environment. Agriculture is still only a sideline of economy. As in
other Andean villages, there is only little external financial support for the
community of Irohito.
      The language situation can be roughly described as follows: no one speaks
Uchumataqu any more, although the knowledge of words and some phrases remains.
In fact, the language of Irohito is Aymara now and there are some women of the
middle and older generation who are monolingual Aymara speakers or have only a
limited knowledge of Spanish. However, younger people and virtually all children,
even those of pre-school age, speak Spanish (and Aymara), as do most of the men.
When asked, younger people consider themselves to be bilingual native speakers of
Aymara and Spanish.
      I was invited by the Inda family and stayed and worked with them during my
visit. The family consists of Lorenzo Inda and his wife, who considers herself to be 1

monolingual in Aymara, the youngest daughter and her four-years old son living with
them. A son and his family live in the neighbouring house as does Lorenzo Inda's
nephew Cyriaco Inda and his family. All of them, exept Lorenzo Inda's wife, speak
Aymara and Spanish. Nine other childen of Lorenzo Inda had moved away for
working. Lorenzo Inda, bom 1947, has always been engaged in political and social
issues of his village. Thus, he was appointed subalcalde43 of Waki and in this
function, was invited to a meeting of American indigenous groups, which was held in
Colombia. Apart from this political function, Lorenzo Inda has always been very
engaged in keeping Uchumataqu alive and attended a workshop at THOA (Taller de
Historia Oral Andina, Workshop on Andean Oral History) to do his own field-work
with Eduardo Inta44. However, the results remained unpublished (Muysken m.s.
2007:5). It is to say that Lorenzo Inda was bom at a time when Uchumataqu was not
acquired as a native language any more and thus, he learned parts of the language by
listening to older people's conversations, particularly those of Carlos Kispe and Luis
Inta45 (Muysken m.s. 2007:5). Therefore, Lorenzo Inda may not be termed a native
speaker in a strict sense but rather as a rememberer. However, next to Julia Vila he
contributed most to the booklet El idioma Uchumataqu (2005), for which Pieter
Muysken was advisory linguist.
      I worked mainly with Lorenzo Inda and to a lesser degree with Cyriaco Inda.
Sometimes a word or phrase was contributed by another member of the community
but indeed the main body of words was provided by Lorenzo Inda. This has only in
part to do with the actual knowledge of Uchumataqu but is more related to the social
status of each community member. That is, Lorenzo Inda is perceived as an authority
not only on Uchumataqu but on several issues relating to the social and political life
of Irohito. It would have been therefore considered highly impolite to utter one's
view before Lorenzo Inda had expressed his opinion and thus, I cannot make a
statement on other community members' competence on Uchumataqu, since they
only supplied information when asked to do so by Lorenzo Inda. Apparently, there
are no women left who know parts of Uchumataqu.
      Lorenzo Inda, his nephew Cyriaco and I met every day and worked on
vocabulary concerning kinship terms, body parts, numerals, the name of some
astronomical phenomena, the translation of the songs published in El idioma
Uchumataqu (2005), and particularly the names of birds, types of totora and other
aquatic plants, types of nets and tools, to which detailed drawings were added. We
also worked on teaching material, consisting of three booklets, which should contain
words and phrases from Uchumataqu together with some ethnographic information46.
      The linguistic data obtained during my visit, however, do not add new
information to the study of Uchumataqu, but indeed are much the same as already
published by Lorenzo Inda himself (1988) and Pieter Muysken (2000, 2001, 2005).","[40, 41]"
"1.4 Description of the sources
In what follows, an analysis of the early sources consulted in this study is presented.
For each source, I will briefly present the personal and academic background of the
researcher before turning to an introduction to his work(s). This introduction
comprises a description of the contents of the work(s) as well as the circumstances
under which the data were collected. Each description is concluded by a personal
evaluation of the work(s) presented.
      It has to be noted that the database on Uchumataqu is restricted and not in every
case quantity of data ensures quality of data, i.e. there are differences due to the
temporal (and in Lehmann's case geographical) distance of the sources. These
differences are considered as far as possible. However, the linguistic analysis is
already complex and in some cases the database for a specific phenomenon is
severely limited so that every single instance ofthat particular phenomenon has to be
taken into consideration in order to reach a conclusion. This means that in some cases
the temporal (and geographical) restrictions imposed by the database cannot be fully
considered. However, in order to ensure an equal treatment of the data, I propose the
following procedure. For evaluation I take into consideration the aspects presented in
the description of a researcher and his work(s) on Uchumataqu, i.e. whether the
researcher was acquainted with the study of South American languages (Quechua and
/ or Aymara), how much time he spent in the community, the state of Uchumataqu,
etc. However, most important for an evaluation is the linguistic content of a
document and its reliability. Reliability of a document can only be provided by a
comparison with other sources on Uchumataqu. That is, information given in a
document is considered reliable when the same information is found in one or more
documents. The more sources confirm the information of a particular document the
more reliable it becomes. However, not every document demonstrates the same
degree of reliability. When a particular information is confirmed only by e.g.
Lehmann's manuscript on Ch'imu, one has to consider that the Ch'imu document
itself is less trustworthy and also less relevant for the Irohito context. Thus, this
particular information might be regarded as being doubtful, although there is
confirmation for it. Thus, for evaluation of the sources I compare their contents with
each other in order to find out how much information can be confirmed by other
sources; but I also take into consideration that some sources are more likely to
provide reliable confirmation than others.
      Note that the names Ancoaqui and Irohito are used to refer to the same place. In
fact, the community of Irohito developed from the settlement of Ancoaqui (cf. 1.3.3)
and is actually surrounded by it, but the language of Ancoaqui has since long been
Aymara. However, Ancoaqui is the better known place and if at all, it is Ancoaqui
that appears on maps and thus, some of the researchers refer to Ancoaqui when
talking about Uchumataqu. I preserved this usage, although this denomination is
somewhat inexact.

1.4.1 Lexical data: Bacarreza, Posnansky, LaBarre, Palavecino
Before turning to a detailed description of the sources, some documents should be
mentioned that can be considered first-hand information (cf. 1.2.2), but which,
however, contribute only to a minor degree to the current study. These are the works
of Bacarreza (1910), Posnansky (1934), LaBarre (1941), and Palavecino (1949).
Except for Bacarreza, the researchers provide detailed ethnographic descriptions in
their studies, but have only a small number of lexical terns, none of them in a
grammatical context. Bacarreza is the briefest of the three works, supplying only 26
lexical items and a very short note on some ethnographic information. The
information given by them is part of the lexicon, but does not further contribute to the
grammatical description of Uchumataqu. Therefore, the following will be only a brief
and less detailed presentation.","[42, 43]"
"1.1.2 Uchumataqu compared with Chipaya
Chipaya is the only member of the Uru-Chipaya4 linguistic family that is still in use
today. It has approximately 1,800 native speakers in the communitiy Santa Ana de
Chipaya near Lake Coipasa in southwest Bolivia. Chipaya is highly endangered due
to an increasing influence of Spanish in modem Bolivian society and a shift to
Aymara. Uchumataqu and Chipaya are considered to be as closely related as French
4
   In 2001 the Nacwn Originaria Um (NOU) was formed in Oraro and consists of several groups, who
consider themselves to be of Uru origin. However, none of them speaks a Uru-Chipaya language any
more, with the exception of the Chipaya.
6                             UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
and Spanish (Muysken 2001:77), although the exact kind and degree of their
relationship still has to be explored.
      It has become common usage to refer to the variety of the Titicaca region as
Uru, whereas Chipaya denotes the variety spoken in southwest Bolivia close to Lake
Coipasa. For further discussion of the denominations Uru and Uchumataqu, cf. 1.3.1.
      Both varieties are structurally close to each other and with respect to phonology,
we may say that Uchumataqu and Chipaya are almost identical (at least from what
can be judged from the phonological information on Uchumataqu given in the
sources). However, with regard to morphology, Uchumataqu has certain morphemes
that do not occur in Chipaya, either because Uchumataqu preserved an older stage of
the language due to its isolation or, alternatively, Uchumataqu developed these
morphemes after its split from other Uru-Chipaya. These morphemes, then, are
unique to Uchumataqu. Among these unique morphemes are possibly the personal
pronoun of second person singular kun 'you', which appears to be restricted to
interrogative clauses. Another pronominal form is -wici, which can be described as
an original pronominal plural marker that was used to build niwici 'they' before
Aymara plural marker -naka took on this function. Morphemes that probably
developed after Uchumataqu and Chipaya speaking groups had lost contact are
predicator -kasi, question bound topic marker -xwi, and In-Group marker -acu. The
non-existence of predicator -kasi in Chipaya relates to another difference: in
Uchumataqu, predicator -kasi distinguishes adjectives as a separate word class, while
in Chipaya adjectives form a subcategory of nouns (Cerrón-Palomino 2006:103) but
do not constitute a class of its own5. Uchumataqu resultative -/ resembles Aymara
resultative marker -ta to some degree and Chipaya seems to have borrowed the
Aymara marker. Thus, Uchumataqu -/ and Chipaya -ta are not entirely different but
contrast, just like Uchumataqu -t and the Aymara morpheme. It is possible that
Uchumataqu -t derives from the Aymara form and would be therefore a morpheme
that developed after Uchumataqu and Chipaya had become separated.
      One of the more crucial differences between Uchumataqu and Chipaya is the
locative marking system. As will be further outlined under 4.1.1.2 and 4.1.1.3,
Uchumataqu has two basic locative forms, which are -kis and -fa/, each of which has
an allomorph derived by metathesis: -kis I -ski and -fa/' / -sikf. The form -kis I -ski is
the directional locative, which marks a movement 'into X' with motion verbs, while
with stative or position verbs it is translated as 'in X'. The form -fa/' / -siki expresses
a locative and is always understood as 'in X'. I analyse this as a system in transition
(cf. 4.1.1). Chipaya also has two locative markers -kiz(i) and -kin(a), which do not
possess metathesised allomorphs. The form -kiz(i) refers to entities or objects being
close to the speaker, while -kin(a) marks entities or objects being away from the
!
   Chipaya preserves lexicalisations with -Un, a form that in Uchumataqu serves to create adjectival states,
which form a subcategory of adjectives In Uchumataqu, -/in was still productive at the time of
documentation, but lexicahsed forms with -Im exist too (for further discussion, cf 4 3 5) In Chipaya, it is
doubtful whether the form -tin is still productive Cerrón-Palomino (2006) does not interpret it as a
morpheme
   It has to be noted that the interpretation of-ski and -siki as allomorphs is arguable It may possible that
both forms represent one morpheme and -ski is the same as -siki only with an unstressed -si
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                                                7
speaker (Cerrón-Palomino 2006:128). Uchumataqu, too, uses a form -kina but it is
purely directional. Thus, the two systems are rather different. When I asked a native
speaker of Chipaya to translate the Uchumataqu expression wat-siki 'in the village'
(Uhle 1894:19), he understood it as 'the weave (el tejido)', thus analysing wat- as the
verb stem 'to weave', -s possibly as the action nominaliser followed by a linking
vowel -/', and topic marker -kf.
      Another case of formally similar but functionally different suffixes are Chipaya
-z and Uchumataqu -s. Chipaya -z is analysed by Cerrón-Palomino (2006:159, 160)
as 'reflexivo-mediopasivo', while for Uchumataqu -s I propose an interpretation as
first person singular subject marker. Even if possible interpretation errors are left
aside, the fact remains that both suffixes appear in the same slot, are preceded and
followed by the same types of morphemes, and they even have similar allomorphs,
namely -zh in Chipaya and -s in Uchumataqu. Nonetheless, they cannot express the
same idea since Chipaya -z is not restricted to a particular person, whereas
Uchumataqu -s marks a first person singular as subject. Thus, formally they are
almost identical but differ considerably with respect to function.
      One of the greatest differences between Uchumataqu and Chipaya is that the
latter has a gender distinction, which Uchumataqu entirely lacks. The Chipaya gender
distinction affects nouns, pronouns, and the personal clitics, although there is a
growing tendency to neglect the use of female pronouns, particularly with respect to
the plural form nanaka 'they (fern.)'. This may be due to a growing Spanish
influence on Chipaya, since in Spanish a group of men and women is referred to as
ellos 'they (masc.)'. Only if there is a group composed solely of women would the
female form ellas 'they (fern.)' be used. A similar use of ninaka 'they (masc.)' and
nanaka 'they (fern.)' can be observed in Chipaya8.
      It is possible that some of the morphemes described as characteristic only for
Chipaya existed in Uchumataqu before it became highly endangered. Alternatively, it
is possible that they existed even at the time of documentation, but went unnoticed
because documentation would have required a long-term study of a wider range of
data including conversations between native speakers, story telling, etc. However,
given the high number of different morphemes or formally similar but functionally
different affixes, it seems doubtful that intelligibility between speakers of
Uchumataqu and Chipaya has ever been very high, despite Wachtel's observation
(1990:269) that during a recent meeting of Uchumataqu and Chipaya speakers both
groups could talk to each in ""Uru-Chipaya"". During field-work carried out in January
2006, I asked several native speakers of Chipaya to translate phrases and simple
clauses from Uchumataqu and the outcome was very different. In some cases, there
was hardly any or no understanding at all, while in other cases there was a certain
degree of intelligibility. However, the fact that some Uchumataqu phrases from Uhle
   The interpretation and transcription of these morphemes in Chipaya provided by Cerrón-Palomino
(2006) is slightly different: what I termed action nominaliser -s is labelled the ""infinitivizador"" -z(a)
(Cerrón-Palomino 2006 131), while what I analyse as a linking vowel -ι is termed by Cerrón-Palomino
(2006.87) as ""inflexion vocalica"" The interpretation of-Ai as topic marker is the same for Uchumataqu (cf.
7 2 2) and Chipaya (Cerrón-Palomino 2006 175).

and Métraux could be interpreted by Chipaya speakers does not prove immediate
intelligibility since a French native speaker would probably understand the basic
meaning of a written Spanish text, even without knowledge of Spanish but that would
be probably quite different if (s)he were confronted with rapid, spoken Spanish. This
was actually the case when during field-work I asked the Chipaya native speakers to
listen to the Uchumataqu passages in Vellard's film: none of them could immediately
understand what has been said and it was only after several sessions that they had
gained a general idea of the Uchumataqu texts. That is, it has probably been possible
for an Uchumataqu native speaker to understand whether a Chipaya speaker talked
about his / her family, fanning, or the latest transactions made in La Paz, but details
may remain obscure.","[22, 23, 24, 25]"
"1.4.2.5.4 Vellard 1967
Vellard's article Contribution al estudio de la lengua Uru was published in 1967120.
Vellard himself does not provide any introductory notes, but instead, the brief
introduction is written by Salvador Bucca, who points out that the edition is to be
understood as a complement to Vellard's preceding work on the Uru (1949-1951).
However, the consultation of them is recommended in order to fully comprehend this
edition. The editor also points to phonological variation apparent in the texts. Apart
from this, no further information is provided on how and when the data were
obtained or on the editing process. It thus remains uncertain whether Vellard himself
carried out the translation, analysis, and interpretation of the data or whether another
researcher was involved. The document was published in Spanish in Buenos Aires.
     Although not mentioned explicitly, it becomes apparent in the footnotes that the
language consultants were Manuel and Luis Inta and Carlos Kispe. Luis Inta is
described as ""a mestizo who speaks a very incorrect language""121 (Vellard 1967:36,

translation mine). Dates on pp. 36 and 37 point to the possibility that the data were
collected in 1942 and 1944, except for the data provided by Luis Inta, which
probably come from 1952 (Vellard 1967:34, 36, 37). However, as a footnote (Vellard
1967:36) states the prayers ""Confesión"" and ""Por la senal de la Santa Cruz"" were
recorded nearly ten years after Vellard's first field-work campaign, which, if this
were true, would have been in 1948. This does not correspond to the dates proposed
in table 1.4, for which I am unable to provide an explanation. As usually, no
information on the duration of Vellard's field-work is given.
     The data consist mainly of single clauses and only in some cases do more
comprehensive sequences occur, such as question and response. The clauses are of
varying length and complexity and include imperative and interrogative clauses as
well (Vellard 1967:1-24). They are all provided with a word-by-word as well as free
translation. This section is followed by a sample of adverbs and conjunctions
(Vellard 1967:24-26) and interrogative pronouns (Vellard 1967:26). These
grammatical observations are continued by a brief overview of some suffixes, which
are called ""particles with prepositional force""122 (Vellard 1967:27, translation mine),
whose use is further exemplified by clauses (Vellard 1967:28-32). This part is
followed by some basic grammatical observations, which deal with e.g. reduplication
as a means of reinforcement or the meaning of cuki 'let us' in imperative clauses
(Vellard 1967:33). The subsequent data were provided by Luis Inta and consist of a
question and the response to it as well as of the prayers mentioned above. A footnote
to ""Por la senal de la Santa Cruz"" states that this prayer is a somewhat corrupted
Aymara version (Vellard 1967:35, footnote 2)' 23 . The article concludes with a
comparison of numerals (Vellard 1967:36, 37). The first comparison comprises
numerals 1 to 10 supplied by Manuel Inta124 compared to numerals as provided by
Posnansky and numerals 1 to 5 from Tiwanaku. The entire comparison is titled
""ancient numeration of the Titicaca region (as remembered by some old people)""125
(Vellard 1967:36, translation mine). A next comparison comprises numerals 1 to 10
from the ""Uru of Irohito""126, Chipaya, and Puquina, following Ore (1607). It is
noteworthy that the numerals given by Manuel Inta and those under the heading of
""Uru of Irohito"" are not identical, although the numerals from Irohito are congruent
with the rest of my data (cf. 4.4). Finally, numerals 1 to 10 from Aymara and
Quechua are compared. Some of the clauses published in 1967 had already appeared
in earlier works of Vellard, mainly that of 1949.
     With respect to evaluation we find a situation similar to the one from 1949, i.e.
most of the data can be verified when compared to e.g. Uhle or Métraux. However, as
already indicated for 1949, the amount of Aymara loan words and grammatical
elements is higher than that in other sources and we find a certain degree of
phonological variation. The data provided by Luis Inta are hardly analysable at all.

understandable and not always consistent. That is, in some cases the data and their
analysis and interpretation are best considered separately from each other. The data
themselves are as informative and reliable as those from e.g. Vellard 1949.
     Although Vellard mentions only some of his visits (cf. table 1.4), particularly
those during which he had collected linguistic data, it becomes obvious from
footnotes, etc. that he was in Irohito several times. The following table is an attempt

Table 1.4· Overview of Vellard's visits to Irohito1.4.2.6 Final remarks
Although the personal backgrounds of the researchers presented above are highly
divergent and most of them did not have any intensive contact with each other, the
52                            UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
data collected are consistent to a considerable degree. That is, the grammatical
materials provided by Uhle (1894) and Métraux (1935) are very well comparable and
confirm each other's results, which is also true with respect to the lexical material
collected by Polo (1901) and Lehmann (1929). It is only with Vellard's data that we
find a certain difference with regard to the results of the preceding studies, which can
be ascribed to an increasing influence of Aymara and the de facto extinction of
Uchumataqu. It is one of the tragedies of the language that the first researchers
studied Uchumataqu when it was still a spoken language, although already highly
endangered, unfortunately left hardly any information on their language consultants,
etc. Therefore, we know virtually nothing about their field trip experiences. Vellard
was the only researcher who bothered to introduce his language consultants and
provided background information on his field-work. However, Vellard visited Irohito
when the community and its language had as good as vanished. Despite these less
favourable circumstances the data found in the several documents can be regarded as
a reliable and highly informative source on Uchumataqu.
      Certain restrictions have to be taken into consideration when dealing with the
sources on Uchumataqu. Although not always mentioned explicitly, we have to
assume that data collection required the use of three languages: Spanish, Aymara,
and Uchumataqu. This gives plenty of room for interference on the language
consultant's as well as on the interpreter's and researcher's parts. Furthermore, none
of the language consultants, interpreters, or researchers was a native speaker of
Spanish127.
      It also has to be taken into consideration that only Uhle had professional
linguistic training, while the other researchers were either social anthropologists or
even came from completely unrelated disciplines. For them, the recording of
Uchumataqu was rather a sideline in their career, which they did not further pursue
(except Vellard)128. This leads to the observation that all researchers lived in a time
when the idea of academic research differed considerably from that of present-day
research. Even those researchers who did not have linguistic or anthropological
training considered themselves qualified to collect linguistic data, a consideration
originating in the old idea of the 'all-round scientist'. Furthermore, there were no
standards or a unified methodology for language documentation and description and
thus, every researcher used his own techniques and methodology. Particularly Uhle
was influenced by a Latin-based grammar model, which he tried to apply to
Uchumataqu. Furthermore, most researchers tried and compared Uchumataqu to
Aymara and, to a lesser degree, to Quechua, which does not yield satisfying results,
particularly with respect to the verbal system. This bias towards a standardised
(Andean) grammar model resulted in turning the language consultant's information
into what was thought appropriate by the researcher, as in the case of Uhle.
     Other aspects that today would be considered inadequate are the short periods of
time spent in the language community as well as the collaboration with only one or
two persons. The average time spent in Irohito was about one week129, which is     With the exception of Polo and Palavecino
     Cf. Muysken and Hannß (2006 218)
     With the exception of Vellard.
CHAPTER 1 - INTRODUCTION                                                              53
hardly sufficient to document a language in depth. Thus, particularly complex
features of the language, such as e.g. the verbal system, could not be explored in
detail, even if they were (more or less) fully functional at the time of documentation.
      When talking about language consultants we have to consider that probably
most or all of them would have been men. That is, all the researchers were men and it
is likely that they got into contact with men first and due to the short time they spent
in Irohito could not intensify their contact with women. Therefore, potential gender
distinctions and / or gender related speech130 may have been impossible to record.
The only exception is Vellard, who mentions women among his language consultants
and reports so-called ""phrases d'amour"" (Vellard 1951:21, 22), in which a woman's
speech is recorded.
      It should be emphasised once more that Uchumataqu has been an endangered
language at every stage of its documentation and description, and in the case of
Vellard it has to be regarded as almost extinct. This is of course crucial to the
analysis and interpretation of the data since even in the earliest documents most
complex structures were already simplified, used incorrectly, have simply vanished,
and / or have been replaced by Aymara. These processes explain why in some cases
there are limited, contradictory or even no data at all on particular phenomena. The
process of language death as well as the in part insufficient data collection impose
some considerable restrictions on the data.
      Finally, the researchers were influenced by political and social circumstances.
This is particularly the case for researchers of late 19th century, when the so-called
""War for the Pacific"" (1879-1884) was fought between Chile, Peru, and Bolivia
(Loza 2004:22). This war was followed by rebellions of the indigenous population
against Spanish domination during a time when Uhle was at the Lake Titicaca region
(Loza 2004:23). The rebellions themselves were a kind of prelude to the so-called
""Federal War"" between 1898 and 1899 (ibid.), a time when Polo, too, carried out his
research. Another example of the influence of external factors is that Vellard's final
visit to Irohito in 1952 coincided with a revolt of farmers, miners, and students who
succeeded in installing a new government131. Thus, the political atmosphere was at
times less favourable for European researchers to visit and work in indigenous
communities and might have prevented further studies.
     After having evaluated the sources with respect to their reliability and usefulness
for a grammatical description, I will provide an overview of the numerical
contribution of each document to the amount of data (cf. tab. 1.5). Column Β
provides numbers on purely lexical material as given in word lists, which excludes
Vellard 1949 and 1967. Column C offers the amount of words found in phrases,
clauses, and texts, therefore excluding Bacarreza (1910), Posnansky (1934), LaBarre
(1941), and Palavecino (1949) while in D an overview of the total number of words
in each source is supplied. Columns E and G show the proportion of their
contribution to the whole corpus of data.","[66, 67, 68, 69, 70]"

make it almost impossible to determine whether 'water' actually starts with a uvular

or labialised. Variation does not only occur between two (or more) sources but also     ""le «II» ou I mouillé de la même language.""

transcription. This makes it virtually impossible to work with minimal pairs and thus,
I do not use the notion of minimal pair in order to establish phonemes of
Uchumataqu. Rather, I decide to take as phonemes those sounds that occur in every
or almost every source. I allow for some variation with respect to Polo, who uses a
kind of Spanish alphabet and does not represent e.g. a postalveolar voiceless fricative
[I] which, on the other hand, is present in every other work. Thus, a sound must occur
in the majority of the sources in order to be treated as a phoneme. However, if its use
suggests allophonic rather than phonemic status, this is discussed in the relevant
section.
      Every section starts with a description of those sounds I regard as phonemes,
followed by a description of non-phonemic sounds. Phonemes are represented as e.g.
/a/, whereas non-phonemic sounds occur in brackets [ä]. Symbols are represented as
e.g. <â>. The headlines of sections dealing with phonemes are bold whereas sections
on non-phonemic sounds are plain. However, it is important to keep in mind that the
distinction between phonemes and non-phonemes, as proposed in the current study,
remains tentative, given that fieldwork and recording of speech is no longer possible.
Thus, the background to the sources leads to a considerable amount of variation and
in some cases, the interpretations are even contradictory.","[75, 76]"

    Uhle (1894'92.1) reports three instances where ana seems to be combined with the pronoun of
exhortative first person plural inclusive cukfij However, Uhle himself (1894.65) points out that in Irohito
no such combination exists and therefore, these uncertain instances will not be considered in the following
596
    Both hek 'who' and culu 'what' are in principle interrogative pronouns (see 4.2 5) but serve as
indefinite pronouns as well
264                         UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
(46)       anas      hek-i    pek-aca-cay

           'Nobody would want it.'                              (Uhle 1894:90)

           'We [certainly] did not kill any lama.'597 (Vellard 1967:11)
Since negation ana and the indefinite pronoun form one expression, they hardly ever
split up. However, on a few rare occasions this is possible and we may assume that it
is highly marked in order to express e.g. emphasis.
(48)       qotsuni-pini ci waxlfaj-stani ana tox'sasm ci-cul
           Uru-AFF         one village-COM NEG other          what
           'The Uru have only one village (lit.: The Uru are with one village); there is
           not any other.'                             (Vellard 1967:18)
The overwhelming majority of negative indefinite pronouns appears at the beginning
of the entire clause, in one case, it immediately precedes the verb phrase it negates,
and example (48) is the only instance where the expression occurs at the end of the
clause. Thus, we may assume that example (48) is marked twice, i.e. the negative
indefinite pronoun occurs at the end and, furthermore, it is split up.
       In the last category to be discussed here, the negation ana is combined with
lexemes in order to express an antonymic relation. Since the resulting expressions are
found throughout the sources, they may be regarded as lexicalised. The following
combinations exist: ana cuni 'bad (lit.: 'not good')', ana ci cuni 'bad (lit.: 'not one
good')', ana cini 'mute (lit.: 'the one who does not speak')', and ana ep(-cic) 'orphan
(lit.: 'no father[-having]')'. At least for the paraphrastic expression ana cini 'mute'
exists a synthetic synonym which is cukcilai or chuxta, respectively (Polo 1901:473,
Muysken 2005:45).
(49)       ana aep-cic
           NEG father-POS
           Orphan'                                              (Lehmann 1929b: 12)

           'a bad name'                                         (Métraux 1935:102)
The negation ana can be inflected with personal (example 51) and clausal clitics,
such as declarative -cay (example 52) although in most cases it does not take
morphological marker at all (examples 49, 50).
(51)       ti-kfij     anas           cuni     oklai-cay

           'This bad [man] goes.'                               (Métraux 1935:101)  The clitic element -TO on xala 'lama' points into the direction of a reading 'your lama'
  Usually, toxsa serves an Uchumataqu name for the Aymara people, meaning 'the others' It is uncertain
why it is employed here instead ofcila 'another'
CHAPTER 6 - ADVERBS, POSTPOSITIONS AND NEGATION                                                 265(52)       ana-cay cum

           'It is bad'                                          (Uhlel894 66 1)
In most cases, the lexemes that are combined with ana do not take further
morphological marking However, ep 'father' and cim 'speaker' are exceptional,
since they can be inflected with possessive -ci and subject relativiser -ni,
respectively
     With respect to word order, the lexical expressions have a tendency to appear
either at the beginning of the entire clause or to precede the item they refer to,
although this happens less often Only in two cases does the negative lexical
expression follow the negated phrase (examples 53) and both clauses are predicate
clauses
(53)       tara 9 ana-cay cum
           maize NEG-DEC good
           'The maize is bad '                                  (Métraux 1935 101)
Only in some exceptional cases does negation ana lose its final vowel In the works
of Vel lard (1949-67) and Muysken (2005) the negation is sometimes decnbed as
hana or jana, respectively This points to a fricative quality the initial sound may
have, similar to Aymara ham (ci Portene-Gutiérrez 1981 32) However, in the
majonty of all cases600, the negation is transenbed as ana and therefore, I adopted
this spelling here
  A loan from Aymara

  This includes Ihe works of Uhle (1894), Polo (1901), Lehmann (1929) Metraux (1935), and the
majority of Muysken (2005)
7 CLAUSES
In what follows, I will describe the clause types Uchumataqu displays and the
morphological means by which they are marked. I will first discuss clausal and
personal clitics before turning to a description of clause types, including declarative,
imperative, and interrogative as well as predicate clauses. The final sections will be
concerned with the several types of complex clauses in Uchumataqu.","[280, 281, 282, 283, 284]"
"2.11.2 Deletion of foreign elements
In some cases, foreign elements are deleted, particularly when occuring in positions
not allowed for this sound in Uchumataqu (149).
(149)       comunidad —> ku.mu.ni.ta         'community' (Vellard 1949:165)
            esquina   —• ski.na.-cay         'it is a comer'(Vellard 1951:12)
            diabolo   ->· diao.lo            'devil'         (Uhle 1894:92.2)
In the first case of comunidad turned to kumunita, final lal is simply deleted instead
of being devoiced to l\l (see below) which becomes explicable when one considers
that in Uchumataqu morphologically simple forms with l\J in word final position do
not occur (cf. 2.2). The deletion of initial Id, which is unstressed and syllabic, is
noteworthy since Uchumataqu does allow Id in word initial position. However, it is
possible that skina- spread into Uchumataqu through Aymara, which does not have
Id and accordingly deleted it. Voiced bilabial Ibi is not a phoneme of Uchumataqu
and is therefore mostly turned into semivowel /w/. It is possible that such a process is
present here, too, in which Spanish diabolo could have been realised as diawolo. This
could have led to an assimilation of semivowel /w/ to following lol, resulting in the
form diaolo with the tripthong <iao>. However, this is the only example where Dol is
simply deleted since otherwise, it is realised as /w/. Of the three main processes
mentioned above, deletion of foreign elements is the one used least.
      A related phenomen is what I label monophthongisation , i.e. a complex sound
is dissolved into one vowel by deleting the second component. This happens
frequently with Spanish words containing [ie], which is almost always realised in
Uchumataqu as simple [i]. Since Uchumataqu itself has diphthongs, it is likely that
this phenomenon spread from Aymara into Uchumataqu.

It is only with the word pariente 'relative' that [ie] is reduced to Id which may be
due to the Spanish pronunciation where [ie] in pariente may be realised as an
onglide226 rather than a true diphthong. Thus, Id would be the dominant component
which is then the one maintained in the Uchumataqu realisation.

In the following example, the sequence [ay] is reduced to [a], which is remarkable
since the original term comes from another Andean language. The origin of tayta is
indeed Spanish, but the term has already been borrowed into Quechua in early
colonial times.

Replacement is the most frequent process that occurs with loan words. By
replacement I understand that a phonological element that does not occur in
Uchumataqu or does not occur in a particular position is replaced by another element.
This is the case when e.g. HI is replaced by Id or /f/ is shifted to /p/. Replacement
itself comprehends several processes, such as defricativisation, devoicing, etc.
Therefore, some examples provided to demonstrate a certain process show other
processes as well. To avoid confusion I will concentrate on one feature in each
section, which is additionally marked bold. This means further that some examples
are quoted more than once in order to demonstrate the different processes. Each will
be described below, beginning with consonants, followed by vowels.","[116, 117]"

Samenvatting
De taal Uchumataqu werd ooit gesproken in de omgeving van het Titicacameer en
langs de bovenloop van de Desaguadero rivier, maar is rond 1950 uitgestorven. Het
onderwerp van dit onderzoek is de gemeenschap Irohito (Noordwest Bolivia). Dit
dorp was één van de laatste nederzettingen in het noorden van Bolivia waar de
bevolking Uchumataqu sprak. Het aantal sprekers is waarschijnlijk altijd vrij klein
geweest: waarschijnlijk nooit meer dan 150 sprekers. Het Uchumataqu vormt samen
met het gerelateerde dialect Chipaya de taalfamilie Uru-Chipaya. Deze wordt gezien
als een geïsoleerde taalfamilie.
      Verschillende onderzoekers hebben Irohito bezocht, totdat een ernstige droogte,
gedurende de jaren 40 van de 20e eeuw, een einde maakte aan het Uchumataqu als
een gesproken taal. De Duitse taalwetenschapper Max Uhle was de eerste die
linguïstische gegevens heeft verzameld in Irohito in 1894. Hij werd gevolgd door
José T. Polo, Zenón Bacarreza, Walter Lehmann, Alfred Métraux en Jehan (Jean)
Vellard. Vellard heeft als laatste gesproken Uchumataqu opgenomen. Het door Uhle
en Lehmann verzameld materiaal bleef ongepubliceerd. Recent onderzoek in de jaren
90 van de 20de eeuw en het begin van de 21ste eeuw werd uitgevoerd door Colette

      Dit boek bevat de eerste grondige beschrijving van het Uchumataqu waarbij
ieder onderzoek, gepubliceerd of ongepubliceerd, naar het Uchumataqu wordt
betrokken. Dit onderzoek is gebaseerd op de voorheen genoemde onderzoeken en de
gegevens die daarin zijn verzameld. Observaties over de huidige situatie in Irohito
werden verkregen gedurende een veldonderzoekdoor de auteur. Het veldwerk werd
uitgevoerd in Irohito.
      In hoofdstuk 1 worden de sociale, geografische en historische achtergronden van
Irohito en het Uchumataqu beschreven. De genetische verwantschap binnen de Uru-
Chipaya taalfamilie wordt bediscussieerd en Uchumataqu en Chipaya worden met
elkaar vergeleken. Hierna wordt een korte beschrijving gegeven van het theoretisch
kader en de gebruikte terminologie voor de grammaticale beschrijving, gevolgd door
een overzicht van de geschiedenis van Irohito. Het laatste gedeelte van het hoofdstuk
gaat in op de studies die als grondslag voor dit boek gebruikt zijn.
   Hoofdstuk 2 gaat over het fonologische systeem van het Uchumataqu. De
medeklinkers en klinkers worden eerst geïntroduceerd, waama de klanken die in
leenwoorden voorkomen worden behandeld. Dit wordt gevolgd door de presentatie
van contextgevoelige processen. Binnen deze processen komt elisie van finale
klinkers het meest voor en leidt vaak tot verdere contextgevoelige processen. De
lettergreep en het klemtoonpatroon worden gepresenteerd voordat de representatie en
orthografie worden behandeld. Ik laat tot slot zien hoe de fonemen en allofonen van
het Uchumataqu in de manuscripten worden gepresenteerd.
      Hoofdstuk 3 geeft een overzicht van de morfologische processen. De termen
wortel, stam en woord worden behandeld voordat affixatie, clitische elementen,
samenstellingen, incorporatie en reduplicatie worden gepresenteerd. In het tweede
deel van hoofdstuk 3 worden de zinsdelen van Uchumataqu geïntroduceerd.
      In hoofdstuk 4 wordt het nominale systeem beschreven. Het begint met een
beschrijving van de nominale markeerders en de persoonlijke voornaamwoorden van
Uchumataqu Daarna worden de beschrijvende voornaamwoorden geïntroduceerd In
tegenstelling tot andere Andestalen heeft Uchumataqu een aparte klasse van
adjectieven Deze omvat twee subcategorieën kwantificerende adjectieven en
adjectieven van toestand In het laatste deel van het hoofdstuk wordt het numeneke
systeem beschreven
      Hoofdstuk 5 gaat in op het verbale systeem Het begint met de markering van
tijd, die opmerkelijk is, omdat Uchumataqu alleen de eerste persoon enkelvoud in de
tegenwoordige en toekomstige tijd apart markeert, terwijl alle andere personen
ongemarkeerd zijn Na de beschnjving van tijd volgt een presentatie van de
aspectuele affixen, waarvan slechts dne werden gevonden Dit relatief kleine aantal is
mogelijk het gevolg van taalverhes en de methoden van dataverzameling Binnen de
aspectuele affixen vinden we een prefix, dat tegenwoordig is gelexicaliseerd Na een
korte presentatie van het koppelwerkwoord worden de markeerders voor subject en
object geïntroduceerd Binnen die groep vinden we een ander prefix, een
subjectmarkeerder, dat nog productief gebruikt werd ten tijde van de documentatie
Het gebruik van prefixen in een Andestaal is opmerkelijk en niet bekend van het
Aymara of Quechua De causatieve markeerder wordt kort beschreven voordat de
nominahsatie- en onderschikkingsmarkeerders worden behandeld De begrippen van
modus en modaliteit worden geïntroduceerd in de daaropvolgende sectie In het
laatste gedeelte van het hoofdstuk wordt het validatieve suffix besproken
     Hoofdstuk 6 gaat in op bijwoorden, postposities en het negatiepartikel In
Uchumataqu worden temporale en ruimtelijke bijwoorden en bijwoorden van wijze
gecodeerd als zelfstandige naamwoorden, terwijl bijwoorden van graad en
bijwoorden die bijwoorden en adjectieven modificeren, zich gedragen als
adjectieven In het daaropvolgende deel worden de postposities behandeld Daarna
wordt het negatiepartikel gepresenteerd Uchumataqu heeft een negatiepartikel, dat
woorden, constituenten en hele zinnen ontkennend kan maken
     In hoofdstuk 7 worden de verschillende zinstypes van het Uchumataqu
beschreven Het hoofdstuk begint met een presentatie van clitische elementen,
waarvan de persoonlijke chtica uniek zijn in het Andesgebied Het volgende deel gaat
over de basale zinstypes declaratieve, imperatieve en vragende zinnen Daarna
worden predicatieve zinnen geïntroduceerd Dit wordt gevolgd door een behandeling
van complexe zinnen nevengeschikte zinnen, complementszinnen, adverbiale zinnen
en relatieve zinnen

This book is the first comprehensive grammatical description of Uchumataqu, the lost
language of the Uru of Lake Titicaca in northwest Bolivia. Uchumataqu forms part of
the isolated Uru-Chipaya language family, which was influenced to different degrees
by Aymara, Quechua, and Spanish. The Uchumataqu language became extinct around
1950 and although several researchers had documented the language during the first
half of the 20th century, their results were never considered in a comprehensive
context. Some of the more substantial studies remained unpublished.
         This grammatical description is based on previous publications and archival
materials and provides the most complete treatment of Uchumataqu to date. The
study also comprises a detailed description of the data source situation as well as
a thorough introduction to previous research that resulted in the database for the
present book. In addition, it contains a description of the phonological system and
the morphological processes of Uchumataqu. The nominal and verbal systems are
discussed in detail. Particular attention is paid to the complex person-marking system,
of which the person-marking clitics distinguish Uchumataqu from the neighbouring
Aymara and Quechua languages. Other important topics are nominalisation and
subordination strategies and the existence of a separate word class for adjectives.
The relationship between Uchumataqu and the surrounding Aymara and Quechua
languages is described in detail.
          This book will appeal especially to historical linguists, typologists and Andean
linguists, but it should also interest anthropologists, Americanists, and linguists in
general. In addition to its academic value, this book is a physical record of the extinct
Uchumataqu language for the descendants of its speakers.

"5.4.2 Subject marker -s
The verbal subject marker (su) -s can be regarded as a counterpart to object marker s-
in that it marks a first person as subject and as such the form -s belongs to the affixes
marking grammatical functions. In contrast to the object marker, subject marker -s
regularly marks both first person singular and plural as subject. It is directly attached
to the verb stem and is often followed by object marker -n and the marker of first
person singular -u. It is only in its frequent combination with the marker -n that
subject marker -s is followed by first person singular future marker -a, but no
instance is found where -s alone is followed by -a. I have no explanation for this, but
it seems unlikely that subject marker -s should be restricted to past or present tense.
      The subject marker -s alone appears only a few times in my data (64), but it
occurs regularly in combination with the object marker -n (65, 66).

The marker is not used on its own to indicate person but is combined with person
marking suffixes, such as -u or -a or occurs together with a subject pronoun (64, 66).

This points to an emphatic rather than an obligatory status of subject marker -s. This
assumption is supported by the fact that the subject marker is not required by the
verb, in contrast to object marker s-. Furthermore, there is evidence of verbs that do
not bear subject marker -s, although a first person is the subject. Therefore, I propose
an emphatic status of subject marker -s although it cannot be excluded that the
marker once was obligatory and its non-obligatoriness is due to language attrition (cf.
5.4.1). (67) represents an instance where first person singular is expressed by means
of a clitic element in combination with subject marker -s and future tense marker -a.

           'Tomorrow, I will finish the balsa raft.'    (Métraux 1935:97)  It is uncerain why declarative -cay is missing from the clause.

CHAPTER 5 - THE VERBAL SYSTEM                                                                               229
Despite their difference in status, object marker s- and subject marker -5 are closely
related and can be imagined as bracketing the verb, i.e. either J-V (OB 1-Verb) or V-s
(Verb-su). That is, a first person is marked either as object preceding the verb stem
or as subject immedately following it.
      Subject marker -s is sometimes represented in the form of -i. The forms occur in
free alternation and are not distributed according to phonological criteria, but -.v is the
most common form and according to my proposed spelling (cf. 2.14), the subject
marker is represented as -5. There are no restrictions with respect to verb class.","[245, 246]"
"5.1 Tense marking suffixes
Uchumataqu has a tense system which may be a future / non-future-system although
there are markers for present, past, and future tense. The markers for simple present
and past tense 1 resemble each other more than those for future and simple present
tense (cf. table 5.1). Furthermore, a verb in present457 and past tense can be zero
marked for tense, which is rare for future tense.
      It is only for future and simple present tense that a person distinction is made,
i.e. first person singular is marked differently from all other persons which receive
the same marking, habitual present tense, past tense 1 and 2 may be viewed as having
some aspectual notion to them, due to their lack of person marking (see also 5.2.2).
With regard to the distribution of pronominal and clitic elements, the tenses behave
similarly. The two strategies employed most often are either no marking at all or the
use of a subject or subject pronoun. If neither a subject or subject pronoun nor a
subject clitic is used, we must assume that context contributes to person reference.
However, the first person sg is always clearly marked and very often there is double
or triple marking. In this case, a subject clitic is attached to a subject pronoun, and in
present or future tense the verb takes -u or -a, respectively. In general, clitic elements
do not establish person reference by themselves. The tense markers are applied
disregarding verb class.458Person          Future tense Simple                 Habitual             Past tense I     Past tense II

   In simple present tense, this is the usual way to express any person other than first person singular
458
   Although future and present tense in Uchumataqu are nearly identical to Chipaya, the varieties differ to
some degree in past tense marking Uchumataqu does not have the Chipaya -ci paradigm, which does not
only express past tense but also person reference and gender distinction Furthermore, Uchumataqu uses
the resultative-/faj in a different manner as well
212                           UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
5.1.1 Simple present tense -u and 0
In the Uchumataqu simple present tense, the first person singular is obligatorily
marked by -u (1). For second person singular to third person plural no verbal markers
exist, so there we only find the verbal stem (2)460.

            (7cA will gleich Geld geben.' Now, I want to give money.)
                                                                (Uhle 1894:94.2)

            'The sail fills out, (it is a) great, strong wind.' (Vellard 1949:162)
It is noteworthy that the verbal phrases of first person singular found in Vellard 1951
do not contain the first person singular marker -u (3) and it is only in entire clauses
that the marker occurs (4). No definite explanation can be given for this, but we may
assume that Vellard wishes to present an infinitive form by deleting the first person
singular marker -u.
(3)         wir taxe-cay
            I     sleep-DEC
            'I sleep.'                                                 (Vellard 1951:25)

            'I want [= love] you very much, white man.'                (Vellard 1951:21)
There are some more cases in Métraux (1935) and the work of Vellard (1949-67)
where -u is missing, but those instances are not entirely clear and very often an
interpretation as another person is possible, too (5).
(5)         wist kui-kina     pit-cay
            my house-DiR come-DEC
            'You, (s)he,... come(s) from my house.'
            (To vengo de casa. ')                                       (Vellard 1967:20)
The first person singular marker -u can be preceded by subject marker -s (3, 4) and
object marker -n (4) (cf. 5. 2. 3).
(6)         wir-i-l     tusa                  pa:-s-u(-cay)

   The following statements are restricted to declarative clauses since verbs in interrogative or imperative
clauses behave differently (cf. 7 5 and 7 6).
460
   In Chipaya, -u also serves to mark a first person plural inclusive. However, this is not attested for
Uchumataqu; instead, a first person plural inclusive is unmarked. In Métraux's work (1935) we find some
instances of a first person plural inclusive indicated with -u, but those cases are not entirely clear
Therefore, I consider -u strictly limited to first person singular
CHAPTER 5 - THE VERBAL SYSTEM                                                                            213(7)         wilk espejo-ta       wils      yuk cir-s-n-u-cay

            'I see my face in the mirror.'               (Muysken 2005:56)
Since second person singular to third person plural have no marker of their own, no
preceding suffixes can be listed462. The only morpheme that frequently follows verbs
in the simple present tense is declarative -cay, although this is not a rule because in a
few instances it is attached to other constituents as well. When -cay is not used, the
verb is completely unmarked (except for first person singular where -u is attached).
     Although the example clauses are translated as simple present, semantics and /
or pragmatics point into the direction of actions or events happening at the moment
of speech (e.g. examples 1, 2, 6, 7). That is, these actions or events do not take place
over an extended period of time but are restricted in their temporal scope to the
moment of speaking and are therefore seen as conveying a progressive meaning
The following two examples contain a progressive form in their translation.

(9)         amcuka lux-cay
            you       eat-DEC
            'You (all) are eating.'
            ('VOMÌ êtes en train de manger'')                        (Métraux 1935:100)
General existential statements are formed with the copulative verb sel 'to be'.

            'There areno women here.'465          (Métraux 1935:91)
Since except for first person singular, person reference is not indicated on the verb,
the use of pronouns and clitics should be important to the understanding of a clause.
For second person singular to third person plural it is most common to find a subject
or subject pronoun before the verb, but the use of a subject clitic is exceptional. The
most common way to mark first person singular is to attach -u to the verb, which
itself is preceded by a subject pronoun which bears a subject clitic -/ (cf. 1, 6).
Although it seems crucial to indicate person by pronouns and / or clitics, there are
many instances in which person is not marked at all (except for a first person singular461
    The forms wilk and wils are slightly different from the general representation wir 'Γ, as chosen here
The difference cannot be explained. The word espejo is a loan from Spanish and as asuch, the
representation with <j> is maintained.

The interpretation of -in I -ni as markers of habitual present tense is in part inspired
by the meaning and function these forms have in Chipaya (cf. Cerrón Palomino
2006:148). This is necessary because, the Uchumataqu database for -in I -ni is limited
and the translations given in the sources are not transparent with respect to the
meaning of -in I -ni.
        The form -in and its allomorph -ni are attached to verbs and form part of the
Uchumataqu tense system. They mark a habitual present tense (HP) and are therefore
translated as 'habitually' or 'usually'.

           '[Usually], the mother nurses [breastfeeds] for two years.'
The habitual present tense markers -in I -ni are attached to the verb stem and can be
followed by either declarative -cay or Topic marker -ki (cf. 13, 14). The application
of -in I -ni prevents the use of first person singular -u in present tense, as
demonstrated in (15). This feature points in the direction of a tense marking function
since one would expect first person singular -u to appear if -in I -ni were purely
aspectual. However, they themselves have no person marking function471, so in most
of the cases, a subject or subject pronoun is used to express person reference (cf. Π­
Ι 5). It is not expressed by clitic elements alone.

Habitual present tense -in I -ni is attached to action and action-process verbs
Because of the limited database on -in I -ni they may occur in another verb class as
well, but as expected, we do not find -in I -ni on stative, position, or cognition verbs,
whose meanings already express a habitual concept.
      There are homonymous forms where a linking element /i/ is inserted and
immediately followed by the object marker -n. In such clauses, it can only be
clarified through context whether an habitual present tense is expressed, cf. (16).

With respect to the phonological distribution of habitual present tense -in and its
allomorph -ni, we find free alternation when they appear between two consonants.
After a vowel, -ni follows, while after a consonant -in is applied (either followed by a
vowel or as the final element). In general, -in is employed more often than -ni.                                                     -in      -ni

5.1.3 In-Group marker -acu
The suffix to be described in the following does not entirely belong to the group of
tense marking morphemes but will be treated with these suffixes due to its almost
exclusive use with present tense. The In-Group marker -acu marks a first person
plural exclusive and is therefore best translated as 'we (excl.)', excluding the
addressee. The use of this suffix is remarakble because it can occur with the pronoun
of the first person plural inclusive ucumi 'we (incl.)'.
(17)        ucumi      awaris474-taki lux-acu-cay

            ('ucumi awari-staki lux '-acucay "")                     ( Vellard 1949:167)
However, the use of -acu implies that the addressee is not included, as in (18), where
it is unlikely that the speaker includes the addressee (in this case Vellard) since he
refers to a custom characteristic for his own group. Furthermore, the marker -acu can
be attested only to a certain degree since it is found solely in the works of Métraux
(1935) and Vellard (1949-67). It is in the latter that we find a frequent use of the In-  In one uncertain case we find a possible instance of-in on the weather verb cur- 'to rain'

Group marker -acu, but in Métraux it appears only in a few cases. Not only is it
missing in Uhle (1894) as well but such an element is likewise unknown from
Chipaya.
      In-Group marker -acu cannot be satisfactorily integrated into the Uchumataqu
person marking system, but I would like to point to its presumably recent origin. It is
possible that Uchumataqu once had a four-person system consisting of the pronouns
of first to third person singular and ucumi 'we (incl.)'. As outlined under 4.2, ninaka
'they' and wisnaka 'we (excl) 'may have possibly developed only by an increasing
influence of Aymara. This influence may have caused either the 'invention' of -acu
as a verbal bound marker to indicate the newly adopted first person plural exclusive
or the re-interpretation of an already existing but distinctly used morpheme. As a
further support to this assumption may be taken that -acu is reminiscent of first
person plural ucumi and may have been derived from it to create a verbal bound first
plural exclusive marker.
      However, since there is no firm evidence for this in the sources, I will analyse -
acu as the In-Group marker, which excludes the addressee. For the following
discussion, I rely mainly on Vellard (1949-1967).
(18)       alma475 skit'ti-k[i]   huk-acu-cay
           soul    clothes-TOP bum-iN-DEC

           'We do not know how to swim in the water.' (Vellard 1967:4)
Although In-Group marker -acu is not limited to a specific tense, it is very often
translated as present tense477. However, there are a few instances which are translated
as past tense478 and / or with a person reference other than first person plural
exclusive. These cases are not entirely clear and allow an interpretation as present
tense and first person plural exclusive as well (20).

           (' Yo he venido del pueblo. ')                          (Vellard 1967:29)
Since the form -acu already establishes person reference, the vast majority of all
cases lacks subject pronouns or subject clitics, as in (18) to (20). Thus, the
application of subject pronouns and / or clitics may be considered emphatic, as in
(21, example 17 repeated).","[228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"

    As will be shown in subsequent sections and chapters, adverbs stand between nouns and adjectives
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                                       153
3.6.2 Adjectives
Adjectives in Uchumataqu form an open, separate class of words. The most common
function of adjectives is to serve as modifiers of nouns, as demonstrated in (89).
(89)      cuni soni-naka
          good man-PL
          'good men'                                      (Uhle 1894:28.2)321
Since adjectives function as modifiers of head nouns (as in 89), they themselves do
not occur as heads of phrases except for some attributive predicate clauses (cf.
chapter 7), as in (90).
(90)        utca-kasi-cay
            small-PRE-DEC
            'it is small'
            ('«M/ '-co kasi-cay')                                   (Vellard 1949:152)
Thus, their restricted ability to appear as heads of phrases sets them apart from nouns,
whose normal function is to act as heads of noun phrases.
    On the structural level, adjectives differ from both nouns and verbs in that they
do not take nominal or verbal markers with some exceptions. There are two or three
elements322 that describe concepts that could be encoded as adjectives but which in
Uchumataqu are expressed as verbs. Please consider examples (91) and (92).
(91)        oc-u-cay
            tired-ISG-DEC
            'I am tired (lit: 'I do tire.')'                        (Uhle 1894:89.1)323
(92)        wet-i-l            as(i)n-u
            my-LV-CL=l         ill-lSG
            'I am ill (lit.: My being ill.)'324                     (Métraux 1935:100)
Apart from the presumably verbal use of some otherwise adjectivally encoded
concepts, another exception occurs with predicator -kasi. As will be further outlined
below, this element is usually restricted to predicative adjectives but there are six
cases where it occurs on nouns. However, some of these are doubtful and in others,
predicator -kasi seems to be used to further stress the fact that one is dealing with a
nominal predicate clause (cf. 93). If this interpretation is correct, the use of -kasi in
nominal predicate clauses may be considered hypercorrect.

the verbal use of oc- 'to be tired' in Uchumataqu comes from Métraux (1935).

    This example is sinking The pronominal form is possessive, meaning 'my', whereas the following
form appears to be verbal due to the use of first person singular marking -u. I have no explanation for this
154                         UCHUMATAQU: THE LOST LANGUAGE OF THE URUS OF BOLIVIA
However, apart from this rare and somewhat doubtful overlap, adjectives do not
share morphology with neither nouns nor verbs. Instead, they take predicator -kasi,
which is used to predicate adjectives (see 90 and 94).
(94)      cuni-kasi-cay         wir-ki
          gOod-PRE-DEC          I-TOP
           'I am well.'                                   (Vellard 1967:23)
Predicator -kasi does not occur on either verbs or nouns, except for the anomalies
mentioned above and thus, it is a morpheme restricted to adjectives alone.
      However, although there are some overlaps with nouns and verbs, the functional
and structural properties of adjectives set them apart from both these categories and
sufficiently classify them as a word class of their own. For a more detailed discussion
of the basis on which adjectives are classified as a separate class of words, cf. 4.3.
      The category of adjectives comprises four subcategories, which to varying
degrees share features with the class of adjectives. However, none of these
subcategories can be termed prototypically adjectival. Each of them will be discussed
below.
      The first subcategory consists of adjectival states derived from verbs by
application of -tni or its allomorph -tin, which itself results from a combination of
resultative -/ and subject relativiser -ni (cf. 5.2.1, 5.6.1). Adjectival states like
prototypical adjectives do not take nominal or verbal morphology and even when
they appear in predicative function they are not inflected with the adjectival
predicator -kasi325 (95).
(95)      xlu.a sitin
          totora raised
          'The torora reeds are raised (in bundles).'              (Vellard 1949:164)
Therefore, from a structural point of view, adjectival states differ from prototypical
adjectives. However, with respect to functional properties we find that -tni I -tin
marked States behave very much like adjectives, i.e. their most important function is
to modify nouns (cf. 96 and 97). It is necessary to point out that the majority of
expressions containing -tni I -tin is lexicalised and it is thus impossible to trace the
underlying verb form (96).
(96)       ana matni tukun wawa
           NEG fertile woman
           'an infertile woman; a barren woman'                    (Métraux 1935:90)
(97)       ma-s             cer-tni yuk-ci:-cay
           mother-GEN see-ST face-POS-DEC
           '(S)he looks like his / her mother.
           (lit.: 'The face looked upon is mother's.')'            (Uhle 1894:71)
That is, the link between adjectives and adjectival states is their common function to
act as modifiers of nouns. A point not discussed here is their meaning, which further  Except for one case which I regard as exceptional
CHAPTER 3 - MORPHOLOGICAL PROCESSES AND WORD CLASS                                                          155
suggests to classify -tni I -tin marked items as adjectives. For a more detailed
discussion on adjectival states, cf. 4.3.5.
      The second subcategory consists of adverbs that express manner and verbal
degree or modify other adjectives or adverbs (cf. 6.1.3 to 6.1.5). With regard to
structural properties, we find that these adverbs behave like prototypical adjectives in
that they are inflected with predicator -kasi when used predicatively (98)326.
(98)        ipa-kafsi]      selx-cay
            little-PRE      be-DEC
            'There is little.'                                        (Métraux 1935:103)
In contrast to adverbs expressing time, location, and direction (cf. 3.6.1), adverbs that
signify degree and modification do not take nominal marking. With respect to their
functional properties, it is possible to state that their main function lies in modifying
verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, as demonstrated in examples (99) and (100).
(99)        qhi:pi   oqlay-a
            quick    go-IMP
            'Go quickly! '                                            (Uhle 1894:98.1 )
( 100)      wali cipi-pini-cay
            much filled-AFF-DEC
            'Very well full.'                                         (Vellard 1951:12)
Although these adverbs do not modify nouns (as do prototypical adjectives) but other
parts of speech, from a structural as well as functional point of view they are close to
prototypical adjectives. Therefore they can be considered to be a subcategory of
adjectives. Thus, adverbs stand between nouns and adjectives with adverbs of time,
direction, and location being encoded nominally (see above), while adverbs of
manner, degree, and modification behave like adjectives.
     The third subcategory is built by quantifying adjectives of which there are only
two instances: yuki 'much, many' and sapa 'every' (cf. 4.3.4; for yuki, see also
6.1.4). With respect to their structural properties they behave similarly to adjectival
states, i.e. they do not take any morphological marking.
(101)          yuk[i] qa:
               much money
               'much money; a lot of money'                              (Uhle 1894:29)
                                                     121

               'Blood comes every moon = menstruation.' (Vellard 1950:59)
As shown in (101) and (102) both yuki and sapa function as modifiers of nouns,
which is their functional link to prototypical adjectives. That is, although none of

them is inflected with morphological markers, they are related to adjectives by their
function as nominal modifiers.
     The last category to be discussed are numerals. Structurally they differ from
adjectives as presented above because numerals are obligatorily inflected with
nominal possessive marking -ci, thus being structurally closer to nouns than to
adjectives.
(103)       cep     kalo cep-ci-ci
            three ten      three-POS-POS
            'thirty-three'                                (Vellard 1951:18)
However, apart from the lexicalised expressions of pikiltan I puhultan 'the two
together' and cepultan 'the three together' (Métraux 1935:95, 108) no other nominal
markers appear on numerals. So far, no instance is found where numerals appear as
heads of phrases. From a functional point of view, they resemble adjectives since
their main purpose is to act as modifiers of nouns, as shown in (104).
(104)       wir-i-l      pis    xala-kfij   kun-u-cay
            I-LV-CL=1    two     lama-TOPkill-PSTl-DEC
            'I killed two lamas.'                              (Vellard 1967:15)
Thus, the situation of numerals is similar to that of adjectival states marked by -tni I
-tin since numerals differ structurally from adjectives but resemble them very much
with respect to function. On the basis of this consideration, I subsume numerals under
the general category of adjectives.
      As the discussion of subcategories has shown, the class of adjectives is even less
homogenous than that of nouns. Particularly with respect to manner, degree, and
modifying adverbs as well as numerals we find overlaps with the class of nouns.
However, this overlap is a minor one. In most cases, adverbs can be assigned rather
clearly to either the category of nouns or adjectives, while numerals are restricted to
one single nominal morpheme, possessive -ci, and do not take other nominal
marking. What sets these subcategories further apart from nouns is that their main
function is modification of other parts of speech but not to act as heads of phrases.
These features show that the subcategories are not prototypical adjectives but stand
between these and nouns, although to differing degrees they are closer to adjectives,
and are thus treated as adjectival rather than nominal categories here.","[169, 170, 171, 172, 173]"
"2.13.1 Syllable patterns of Uchumataqu
A syllable can be defined as consisting ""of a vocalic peak, which may be
accompanied by a consonantal onset or coda"" (Clark and Yallop 1995:67). In  The form -ske is an alternative of -ski (cf. example 200).

accordance with this definition we find the following syllable patterns in
Uchumataqu

A vowel as syllable peak cannot take more than three consonants, ι e either two
consonants in the onset and one in the coda or vice versa There is no lexeme that
consists of a single vowel, although Uchumataqu has syllabic vowels, as represented
in example (201) (cf Cerrón-Palomino 2006 63) Syllables of the type V, CV, and
CCV are open, in contrast to syllables of the types VC, CVC, CCVC, and CVCC,
which are closed Except for CVCC and CCVC syllables, the syllables have one
mora Syllables of the type CVCC and CCVC have two morae as do syllables whose
nucleus consist of a complex vowel sequence Those syllables are open Please
consider examples (208) and (209)(208)        VV          au na ca        'to wet (somebody or something)'

The syllable pattern of Uchumataqu can be therefore sketched as follows
((C)C)V(V)(C(C)) The most common syllable patterns are CV and CVC, although
Uchumataqu has a tendency to have word initial consonant clusters, in the way of
CCVC (see also example 206 and 2 2 3) However, the following instances of
syllable patterns are restricted to particular grammatical constructions and are so far
the only ones attested Therefore, I regard them as exceptions

Example (211) is the only item which displays the otherwise impossible pattern of
CCVCC, which is due to the preceding object marker s- Although it is not reflected
in the translation, the use of object marker s- suggests a transitive reading '(s)he cuts

     With respect to the number of syllables in morphologically simple forms, we
find that verbs are either mono- or bisyllabic, whereas nouns can have up to three
syllables However, in the majonty of the cases found in the sources, a
morphologically simple form consists of one or two syllables260
    For establishing patterns of Uchumataqu syllables, I consider only phonemes and their regular
allophones
