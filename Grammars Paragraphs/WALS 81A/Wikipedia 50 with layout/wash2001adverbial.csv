2.3 Syntax
        In Barbarenho, a clause with full subject and object NPs generally has
a Verb-Object-Subject (VOS) structure. Most clauses have at most one full
NP, however (Ono 1996). The verb-initial word order occurs in independent
clauses as well as dependent clauses, such as complement clauses, relative
clauses, and adverbial clauses. Preverbal NPs are pragmatically marked and
are typically not part of the clause that follows. Usually these NPs are set off
by topic or focus particles. Finally, nominalized clauses are common in
Chumash languages. These may occur as subject or object complements,
relative clauses, part of cleft constructions, or as free NPs.
        The following topics are treated in 2.3: basic clause structure (2.3.1),
two-verb predicates (2.3.2), the morphosyntax of nominalized clauses (2.3.3),
pragmatically-marked constructions (2.3.4), complement-taking predicates and
their complement clauses (2.3.5), relative clauses (2.3.6), and appositive
clauses (2.3.7). The chapter ends with examples of coordination in 2.3.8.","[90, 91]"
"2.3.1   Basic clause structure
        The Barbareno clause is typically verb-initial, though the verb may be
preceded by modifiers, conjunctions and cliticized connectives. The clause may
or may not have full NP arguments and oblique adjuncts. If there is more than
one full NP within the clause, then the following orders normally prevail:
objects precede subjects, objects that are not semantic patients precede
objects (ones that are semantic patients) and subjects. All core arguments
precede non-core NPs. Syntactically-dependent constituents within the clause
are typically marked with the proclitic hi=. Following are examples of various
constituent orders.e Verb-Object-Subject (VOS)(244)   cony            VERB                     OBJECT          .

                                   Chapter 12                     éukanu   'so that, in order to' Clauses12.0 Introduction
        There are 27 adverbial clauses that have the conjunction Gukanu 'so
that, in order to'. This conjunction is derived from a combination of the
conjunctions Gu and kanu. As noted in chapter 11, in adverbial clauses the
conjunction Gu has the meaning 'so that, in order to'. In Chapter 2 we saw
examples of the general conjunction Gu, which translates variously as ‘and,
and so; but; so that, such that'. The morpheme kanu also occurs alone. It is
found in a rare adverbial clause type that has only several tokens, and it is
also found in non-adverbial     clauses. When   kanu   occurs   alone, it has the
 meanings 'so that' or 'that is why'. When Gu and kanu co-occur, they are
usually written together as one word in Harrington’s texts. In 16 of the tokens,
 the conjunction Gukanu is phonologically attached to the verb that follows it.
 In the other 11 tokens, Gukanu appears as a separate phonological word. It
seems clear that, at the time of Harrington’s field work, Gu and kanu were
grammaticizing into a single conjunction, giving rise to the adverbial clause
type described in this chapter.
       Like the Gu    'so that, in order to' adverbial clause type, all tokens of
the Gukanu adverbial clause type have a purposive relation to a main clause.
Also, like Gu 'so that, in order to' clauses, Gukanu clauses are all postposed.
Unlike the Gu clause type, however, the Gukanu adverbial clause type
exemplifies a pattern of person marking that is tied to the semantics of
control. As we will see throughout section 12.1, in Gukanu adverbial clauses,
when the main clause subject has full control, subject marking in the adverbial
clause is suppressed. Near the end of the chapter, in section 12.2, there is a
brief discussion and illustration of some non-adverbial clauses that have the
Sukanu conjunction. We will look at ways in which patterns of subject
marking in these non-adverbial Gukanu clauses reflect or do not reflect the
patterns of subject marking found in the adverbial] Gukanu clauses. The
chapter ends with a brief summary in 12.3. Before we begin to explore the
subtleties of person marking in this adverbial clause type however, first we will
see an illustration of a prototypical Gukanu clause, its position relative to its
main clause, and the fundamental ways in which it differs with a Gu clause in
two near-minimal pair environments.","[279, 280]"

                                      Suzanne Wash
        This dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareno Chumash, an indigenous language of California. It explores the
semantic relations, morphosyntactic structure, and discourse functions of
adverbial clauses in this language, with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses crosslinguistically, and from a functionally-
oriented approach to linguistics. Almost all of the data come from narratives
recorded in the 1950s by John Harrington from Mary Yee, the last speaker of
the Barbareho Chumash language.
        The dissertation is divided into five parts. Part I is the preliminaries. It
includes a detailed grammatical sketch of the Barbareno Chumash language.
In Part II I analyze the semantic and morphosyntactic characteristics of
thirteen structurally-distinguishable adverbial clause types. The adverbial
clauses    code    temporal,   conditional,     concessive,    purposive,   reason/causal,
manner, and semantically neutral relations. Semantically neutral adverbial
clauses have both temporal and conditional meanings, and though most
researchers treat such clauses as conditional, in this study I treat them as a
category separate from the temporal and conditional categories. In Part TI I
compare the initial and final tokens of these clause types with respect to
similarities      and   differences    in       structure,    extent   of    scope,    and
punctuation/prosodic boundaries. In Part IV I focus on the similarities and
differences in discourse functions between initial and final clauses that code
purposive, conditional, temporal and semantically neutral relations. In addition
to their qualifying role, the initial adverbial clauses function as pivotal points
of orientation that help create a cohesive and coherent text. However, the
final adverbial clauses only serve to qualify the main clause. They do not
function as pivotal points of orientation in a discourse. These differences
between initial and final adverbial clauses are found crosslinguistically, and
reflect the general cognitive processes involved in the production and
comprehension of discourse (Giv6n 1995). Finally, I conclude this study with
the closing remarks in Part V.                                                               ,                                              viii

1.1 Purpose of this study
         This dissertation presents the first study of adverbial clauses in
Barbareho Chumash, an indigenous language of California. The goals of the
dissertation are two-fold. First, it describes what adverbial clauses look like in
this language, sorting them into types that correspond to certain structural
criteria. Second, it explores discourse-functional explanations for the ways in
which the adverbial clauses pattern as they do in Barbareho Chumash
narratives. Both of these goals are met with a view toward what is known and
expected about adverbial clauses cross-linguistically, in both their grammatical
and discourse-functional properties.
         Much has been published on adverbial clauses. Almost all studies on
adverbial clauses, however, use constructed sentences for data. Relatively few
studies have examined adverbial clauses within the context of non-constructed,
connected discourse, such as monologic narratives and conversation. This
dissertation not only examines adverbial clauses from a discourse context, but
it also provides a rare, in-depth look at adverbial clauses in an American
Indian language. For the reasons cited above, this study aims to be a worthy
contribution to the cross-linguistic literature on adverbial clauses and, more
generally, to discourse-functional perspectives on language.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

        TOP=all          3-PL-take.care.of-PST
        <they all took care of her.>        It may well have been possible for Mary Yee to have chosen the
hypothetical strategy in (36) over the actual order given in the text. New and
re-activated referents are usually coded as full NPs that are either objects or
intransitive subjects, and the NP hi=Soledad          ‘'Soledad' in (36) is an
intransitive subject. However, the strategy in (36) is still less preferable than
the actual order we see in the text, because the third person plural subject,
s~iy-    'they',       in line d. of the text, immediately follows the explicit mention
of the discourse participants that are co-referent with it: Florentino (line b.)
and all of his older and younger siblings (line c.). Such contiguous,
immediately adjacent reference makes it easier for the listener to process what
it is going on with the discourse participants.
         In the previous examples we saw how final temporal clauses can track
newly introduced or re-introduced object NPs. In (37), a final temporal clause
tracks a newly introduced subject NP. The main clause in h. has a subject NP
that is subsequently coded with a subject pronoun in the postposed temporal
clause in line i. The postposed temporal clause has two purposes: it narrows
the meaning of the main clause verb 2ip ‘to say' and it tracks the newly
mentioned referent, 'Luisa'. An initial temporal clause appears in the first
                                             505
line of the story. It establishes the scene at the beginning of the narrative,
which as we saw in 22.1.2 is one of the functions of preposed temporal
clauses.","[527, 528]"

        <so that the lard in the can will not catch on fire.>
        In line b. above, the verb uqpatin ‘to catch on fire' has prefixed to
it the future tense morpheme, sa?-. All of the 27 Gukanu clauses have this
prefix. As we saw in chapter 11, however, sa?- is found in only 5 or 9% of
the 53 Gu 'so that, in order to' clause tokens. This is one of the significant
morphosyntactic differences between the two clause types.
        Another major difference between the Gu 'so that, in order to’ and
éukanu clause types is found in patterns of subject marking on the verb. With
rare exception, Gu clause subjects are always indexed on the verb. For
éukanu clauses, however slightly over half (14 tokens; 52%) have no subject
marking on the verb. The Gu clause in (2) has nearly the same semantic
content as the Gukanu clause in (1) above, but the Gu clause has a subject
pronoun while the Gukanu clause above does not.",[281]

main clause. It continues tracking the referent Lucrecia, first introduced in line
b. The temporal clause has to be postposed because, if it were preposed, the
third person subject prefix s- (in the temporal clause) would be referring to
Florentino, the topicalized NP in line a., instead of Lucrecia, the object NP in
line b. (It will be recalled that pronouns in Chumash languages do not
distinguish gender.) Thus if the order of the adverbial clause were changed,
the meaning would change to:

        Crosslinguistically, we find that preposed and postposed adverbial
clauses may differ in morphosyntactic structure (Givén 1990). The differences
always point to the general tendency for postposed clauses, more so than
preposed clauses, to have a tighter semantic bond with their main clauses. For
the Barbareno Chumash language, differences in morphosyntactic patterning
are best examined in terms of two categories of adverbial clause types: (i)
those clause types that have both preposed and postposed tokens; and, (ii)
those clause types that have only postposed tokens, or an overwhelming
tendency toward postposed tokens. For the relevant clause types in group (ii),
the relationship between morphosyntactic patterning and bondedness with the
main clause was dealt with in part II of the dissertation. A brief recapitulation
of the findings will be given in 18.1. The clause types in group (i) will be the
focus of 18.2. A summary follows in 18.318.1 Clause types that are mostly postposed
         In some of the clause types that are postposed there was a reduction
in pronominal subject marking. For the Gukanu 'so that, in order to' clause
type in chapter 12 and the one purposive ehu 'in order to' clause token in
chapter 15, the loss or retention of the subject pronoun was motivated by the
semantics of agency and control. The greater the control on the part of the
main clause subject (which was always an agent), the greater chance there was
that the adverbial clause would not have a subject pronoun. We saw that the
adverbial clause subject pronoun was retained, however, when the main clause
subject did not have full control over the situation coded by the adverbial
clause. The loss of subject marking in the adverbial clause could happen
whether the adverbial clause and main clause had same subjects or different
subjects. In other clause types that tend to be postposed, especially the kayké
""because ' reason clauses and the kaheé ' like, as if' manner clauses, we saw
that reduction in pronominal subject marking was found mainly in same-
subject adverbial clauses. This pattern reflects the fact that final, same-subject
adverbial clauses tend to have a tighter semantic bond with their main clauses
than postposed, different-subject adverbial clauses.","[386, 387]"

16.2 The remote deictic clitic hu= in kaheé clauses
       The remote deictic clitic hu= is a stable feature in two other
Barbareno Chumash adverbial clause conjunctions, namely 2akay hu 'until'
and    thehu     ‘because,     since,   fram;    in   order   to'.   Clauses   that   have    the
conjunction kaheé almost always have the remote deictic clitic hu=. However,
since two      tokens   were    found without this clitic, it is not included            as an
inherent feature of the conjunction for this adverbial clause type. If the word
immediately following kaneé is already marked with one of the other two
deictic clitics, then hu= will not appear. For example, in (13) line d., the
kaheé conjunction is immediately followed by a fronted noun that already has
a deictic clitic, the proximal he2=. The verb of the clause thus does not have
hu=.","[355, 356]"
"2.3.3.1    Nominalized clauses with third person subjects
        In typical nominalized clauses with third person singular subjects, the
article 1= replaces the third person pronoun s- on the verb. An illustration
of this difference is seen with the pair of clauses in (265). In line a. the verb
yinéi 'to be hot' appears in an elicited, finite independent clause. In (265)
line b. it appears in a nominalized clause that serves as the object argument
of the main verb iSmax 'to throw at'. The verb yinéi 'to be hot' has the
third person subject prefix s-        in the independent clause, but in the
nominalized clause it has only the article 1=, along with the proclitic hi=
which links dependent constituents to the head.",[98]

subject Gu clauses retain person marking in the clause, whether transitive or
intransitive.
        In different-subject Gu adverbial clause constructions, sometimes the
main clause subject has more choice and control over the actions or state of
affairs of the adverbial clause subject, and other times it does not. This
distinction is not coded in the morphosyntax of Gu clauses. As we will see in
chapter 12, however, the semantics of control plays an important role in the
presence or absence of the adverbial clause subject pronoun in Gukanu 'so
that, in order to' clauses. As a result, there are significant morphosyntactic
differences between Gu clauses and Gukanu 'so that, in order to' clauses. So
that there can be an adequate comparison between these two adverbial clause
types, examples of Gu clause constructions are given below that illustrate
different degrees of control on the part of the main clause subject. We will
start with one end of the spectrum, where the main clause subject has total
control over the adverbial clause subject.
        In (7), the main clause subject is a human whose spirit helper
(2atiswin) has endowed him with certain powers. He has full control over
the Gu clause subject. The subject of the Gu adverbial clause is an inanimate
substance--cannon powder. By magically manipulating the cannon powder, the
main clause subject is able to disable the cannons.","[265, 266]"
"Pronominal subject marking
        Different patterns emerged in the marking of pronominal subjects in
the adverbial clauses. In almost all cases where subject marking was affected,
it was affected in the postposed clauses. However, the loss of pronominal
subject marking in the postposed clauses happened for different reasons.
        In all purposive clauses coded by the Gukanu 'so that, in order to'
clause type, the loss or retention of the subject pronoun was motivated by the
semantics of agency and control. When the main clause subject had full
control over the event or situation depicted in the adverbial clause, subject
marking in the adverbial clause was suppressed. On the other hand, when the
main clause subject did not have control over the event or situation depicted                                               348
in the adverbial clause, or, when it was rather the adverbial clause subject that
had full control, then subject marking in the purpose clause was retained.
Purpose clauses could have the subject pronoun suppressed or retained
regardless   of whether
       Alase af   urha  the purpose clause subject was a semantic patient. The
critical difference was the degree of control on the part of the main clause
subject. These generalizations turned out to be true whether the purpose
clause and its main clause had same subjects or different subjects, though
same-subject Gukanu clauses were rare. The semantics of control also seemed
to be the motivating factor behind the loss of the subject pronoun in the one
mehu   ‘because, since, from; in order to'     clause type token that coded a
purpose relation. Interestingly, however, there was rarely a loss of pronominal
subject marking in Gu ‘so that, in order to' adverbial clauses, 100% of which
are purposive and postposed. There were clear instances in which the main
clause subject was an agent that had full control of the event depicted in the
adverbial clause, but even so, the presence or absence       of control was not
something that was coded in the morphosyntax of this adverbial clause type.
With rare exception, Gu    'so that, in order to' clauses were found to have
subject marking whether they were same-subject or different-subject clauses.
In all but one of the few, exceptional cases, the lack of subject marking
involved the third person singular prefix s-. The lack of that subject prefix
was argued to be related to articulatory difficulties having to do with the close
proximity of sibilants.
      In other adverbial clause types, namely the 2akimpi        'during, while;
when! simultaneous temporal clauses, the kKayké 'because'        reason clauses,
and the kaheé 'like, as if' manner clauses, the loss of the subject pronoun
happened mainly in same-subject adverbial clauses. Such loss seems to be
motivated by the fact that postposed, same-subject adverbial clauses have a
tighter semantic bond with their main clauses than do preposed adverbial
clauses or postposed adverbial clauses with a different subject. In Barbareho
Chumash, however, such loss in subject marking applies only to third person
subjects (singular, plural, or indefinite). It never applies to adverbial clause
subjects in first or second person.
        In only several cases was the adverbial clause nominalized. In such
cases, the third person subject pronoun was not retained. This was true
whether the nominalized clause was a same-subject or different-subject
adverbial clause. Such is the expected pattern of nominalized clauses
generally, as we saw in chapter 2.
        In several of the adverbial clause types we saw examples of
discontinuous clauses, in which there is intervening material between the                                       349
adverbial conjunction and the rest of its clause. This intervening material may
consist of an adverbial clause from a different clause type, or it may consist
of a left-dislocated noun. Subject marking is affected in these discontinuous
clauses,

especially clear with the Gukanu 'so that, in order to' clauses in chapter 12.
The discontinuous Gukanu clauses retained subject marking but the regular
(non-disrupted) Gukanu clause counterparts did not retain subject marking.
           Finally, sometimes in the Kayké                      'because'         and kaheé               'like, as if!
clause types, subject marking was lost in different-subject clauses. In most cases
where this pattern occurred the adverbial clause predicate had the stative
prefix 2al-. This prefix never co-occurs with the third person pronoun s-,
but it can and does occur with first and second person pronouns. This co-
occurrence restriction on the third person pronoun s- and the stative prefix
2?al- remains an unexplained phenomenon in Chumashan linguistics. As
pointed out in chapter 2, it is also not always clear why a given predicate
would take the stative prefix instead of the third person pronoun on one
occasion, and then (on another occasion) take the third person pronoun
instead of the stative prefix. Transitivity of the predicate is not in all cases a
factor, since the stative prefix 2al- can and does appear in finite verbs with
transitivizing morphology, such as applicative suffixes. Further research into
the area of third person reference in Barbareno Chumash discourse should
shed light on the patterns of subject marking we have seen in the adverbial

                             Introduction to Part IE
        Barbareno Chumash is a language with a rich variety of adverbial
clause constructions. In this part of the dissertation I discuss and illustrate the
subtleties and complexities one finds in the syntax, morphology and semantics
of this domain of Barbareho grammar.
        Barbareho adverbial clauses code a variety of semantic relations with
main clauses, including temporal, conditional, concessive, purposive, reason,
and manner relations. Some adverbial clause types code only one of these
relations, whereas others code several of them. Some of the adverbial clause
types, however, have tokens that are semantically neutral with respect to
conditionality and time.
        As we explore the ways in which these adverbial clause types code
semantic relations, we will come upon interesting issues and striking
grammatical patterns. Some of these are discussed and predicted in the
typological literature on adverbial clauses, in particular Thompson and
Longacre 1985 and Givén 1990. For example, it is known that adverbial
conjunctions that are semantically unspecific, like English 'when', generally
need to be accompanied by specific tense and aspectual morphology, and/or
lexical temporal indicators, in order to code specific kinds of temporal
relations unambiguously. We see further confirmation of this generalization in
such Barbareho adverbial clause types as mali ‘when' in chapter 6, na if;
when' in chapter 8, and wa ‘if; when' in chapter 9. These adverbial clause
types code temporal relations as well as other kinds of relations.
        One often finds conditional relations to be indicated and underscored
by the modal morphology of a language. We will see that this is also the case
for conditional relations coded by Barbareno adverbial clauses, specifically
haku   'if' clauses in chapter 7,na     ‘if; when'   clauses in chapter 8, and wa
 ‘if; when' clauses in chapter 9.
         Distinctive patterns of pronominal subject marking are well known and
expected in purposive relations. In English, for example, subject marking can
be suppressed in same-subject purpose clauses. In chapter 12, we will see in
the Gukanu clause type, which codes only purposive relations, that subject
marking may be suppressed in either same-subject or different-subject purpose
clauses. We will see that the semantics of agency and control is the motivating
factor that affects pronominal suppression in this adverbial clause type. In
other Barbareho adverbial clause types, however, just the fact that the                                       116
adverbial clause has the same subject as the main clause is enough to create
a semantic bond that is tight enough to allow such pronominal suppression.
We will see this pattern in simultaneous temporal relations coded by
 2akimpi ? ‘during; while' clauses in chapter 5, reason relations coded by
kayké       'because' clauses in chapter 14, and finally in manner relations
coded by kaneé        'like; as if‘ clauses in chapter 16. Pronominal subject
suppression is attested only for third person subjects--first and second person
subject pronouns are always retained in the adverbial clause.
         Sometimes mentioned in the crosslinguistic literature is the fact that an
adverbial conjunction may code the speaker’s or narrator’s expectations with
regard to the likelihood that a given event will occur. For example in English,
the conjunction 'when' connotes a greater expectation or likelihood than the
conjunction ‘if'. In the grammar of Barbareho Chumash adverbial clauses,
this is an important and complex category. Several adverbial conjunctions play
a role in coding the speaker’s point of view with regard to when and whether
an event can occur, will occur, or could have already occurred: mali                   ‘if;
when' clauses (chapter 6), haku 'if' clauses (chapter 7), na ‘if; when'
clauses (chapter 8), and wa _ ‘if; when' clauses (chapter 9). See also the
2akay hu ‘until' clauses in chapter 4 and 2iyeme ‘though; although'
clauses in chapter 10.
        Barbareno Chumash has two adverbial clause types that code
distinctions in reason relations. The Kayké 'because' clauses (chapter 14)
tend to provide motivations for acts performed through talk such as
commands and claims, and reasons for conclusions that are inferred. The
ihehu ""because, since, from' clauses (chapter 15) code causal relations in
which   one    event   causes     another      event   to   occur.   Also,   mehu   clause
constructions always depict unintentional acts or results. The differences in the
reason relations coded by these two clause types reflect distinctions between
internal and external motivations (Halliday and Hasan 1976, Givén 1990:834-
835), distinctions among action-based, knowledged-based and fact-based causal
relations (Schiffrin 1987), and distinctions among fourth-, third- and second-
order types of causal relations in the Entity Type Hierarchy (Hengeveld 1998),
in that mehu     clauses   code    external,    fact-based,    and   second-order   causal
relations.
        There is an array of adverbial clause types that one can identify based
upon specific adverbial conjunctions. Thirteen such clause types are analyzed,
discussed and illustrated in chapters 4 through 16. These comprise almost all
of the adverbial clause types that have conjunctions in this language. There
may be other kinds of Barbareho adverbial clause types that have                                            117
conjunctions, but some possible adverbial clause types were not included
because they could not be clearly identified as adverbial clauses. Also, a
possible adverbial clause type was omitted if there were not enough data or
context that would allow a substantive-enough discussionand illustration for
that particular adverbial clause type. Still, the adverbial clause types discussed
and illustrated in chapters 4 through 16 range from the very rare ku ‘lest, so
that...not' adverbial clause type, which only has two tokens, to the numerous
na ‘if; when; in order to' adverbial clause type, which has nearly 200 tokens.
         Part II has the following chapters, named for the adverbial conjunction
that identifies the adverbial clause type in question:       Chapter 3      Adverbial clauses without conjunctions
       Chapter4       ?2akay hu ‘until' clauses
       Chapter5       ?akimpi ‘during; while' clauses
       Chapter6       mali     ‘when' clauses
       Chapter 7      haku     ‘if   clauses
       Chapter 8      na     ‘if; when; in order to' clauses
       Chapter9       wa ‘if; when' clauses
       Chapter 10     2iyeme 'though; even if' clauses

       Chapter 15     mehu     ‘because, since, from; in order to' clauses
       Chapter 16     kaheé      'like, as, as if' clauses        Chapters 4 - 16 follow a general format. First is a brief discussion of
the adverbial conjunction, including its history and any cognates it is known to
have. Next is an overall view of the number of tokens the adverbial clause
type has, what kinds of semantic relations it codes, and what positions
(preposed or postposed) it may take. The body of each chapter then illustrates
each relevant semantic relation and the ways in which it is coded in that clause
type. Special attention is given to those issues and patterns that stand out, e.g.
unusual or prominent patterns in person marking, tense/aspect/modality, ways
in which the speaker’s point of view is coded, etc.
        The focus of part II of the dissertation is upon 13 adverbial clause
types that have adverbial conjunctions. A much smaller subset of Barbareho
adverbial clauses lack adverbial conjunctions. They are discussed in chapter
3, to which we now turn.","[136, 137, 138, 139, 140]"

2.3.6Relative clause constructions
      Relative clauses are syntactically-dependent clauses that modify a head
noun (head NP). In the sentence they finally caught the man who robbed the
bank, the head NP is the man and the relative clause is whe robbed the bank.
This relative clause is postnominal; it follows its head NP the man. The
relativizer is who; it links the relative clause to its head NP. The head NP has
the grammatical role of object in its main clause: it is the object of the verb
'caught'. The NPrel, or relative-clause co-referent of the head NP, has the
grammatical role of subject: it is the subject of the verb 'robbed'.
         Relative clauses in Barbareho Chumash have the following features.
First, all relative clauses are postnominal. Second, they are linked to the head
noun via the dependent proclitic hi=. Exceptions are rare. Third, all of the
grammatical role positions available in Barbareho can be relativized. Thus
subjects, objects, and obliques--including possessors--can be relativized. Finally,
the grammar of relativization is sensitive to the distinction between core
argument NPrels and oblique NPrels. With rare exception, core-argument
NPrels, i.e. subjects and objects, always occur in nominalized relative clauses.
Only about 60% of the relative clauses with oblique NPrels, however, are
nominalized..
       Below are two sets of near-minimal] pairs that show some differences
between a basic clause and a relative clause construction in Barbareho
Chumash. In (320)b the relative clause is a Subject-relative, because the NPrel
of the head NP ‘ash tree' has the grammatical role of subject in the relative
clause 'that stood near the door of his house '. The third person pronoun s-
is not retained   in the relative clause. As we     saw    in 2.3.3.1,   however,   in
Barbareho Chumash it is normal for nominalized clauses, including relative
clauses, not to retain the third person subject pronoun.(320)

  co-referent of 'rocks' has the grammatical role of object in the relative clause
   ‘that they can throw at one another'. Note that the third person plural object
  -wun is not suffixed to the relative clause verb in (321)b, but neither is it
  suffixed to the main clause verb in (321) a. More study needs to be done on
  where, when and why the plural object suffix -wun appears. This suffix most
_ often appears when the referents are human or otherwise animate, but it can
  also appear when the referents in question are neither human nor animate.  (321)

         Like the relative clause in (321), the relative clause in (322) is an
Object-relative. Structurally they are very different, however. Example (322)
illustrates the only relative-clause token in the analyzed corpus that has a
relativizer in the form of ka=. Like the contrastive focus marker and stative
proclitic of the same form, the relativizer ka= is a reflex of the proto-
Chumash demonstrative *ka. The relative clause construction has a similar
form to the cleft construction illustrated earlier in (284), with the important
exception that the relative clause is not nominalized.","[115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120]"
"In lines d. and h. there are two other instances of a colon. Like the two na
 ‘ifAwhen' adverbial clauses that are punctuated with a colon, these two
clauses have a verb of saying that is followed by quoted speech. These usages
of the colon are congruent with the way in which Harrington used the colon
throughout the corpus of Barbareho narratives: the colon is only used in
clauses that precede quoted speech or a list of things. Given this consistent
use of the colon in Harrington’s transcription, and given that there tends to
be a prosodic boundary between a clause with a verb of saying and the clause
of quoted speech that follows, in spoken speech (Givén 1990), Harrington’s
use of the colon no doubt represents a pause in Yee’s speech.
         Looking again at Table 43, for the two most numerous adverbial clause
types, na 'if; when; in order to' and mali ‘when’, there appears to be only
a slight preference for punctuation in the initial clauses. A little over half of
the initial clauses for both of these types are followed by punctuation. Among
the initial na ‘if; when; in order to' clauses, 53% are followed by a comma
(or more rarely a colon as we saw above). Among the initial mali 'when'
clauses, 58% are followed by a comma. On the surface there appears to be
no motivation for punctuation--Harrington seemed just as likely as not to write
a comma at the end of an initial clause. However, on closer inspection there
turns out to be a relation between the length of the adverbial clause and
whether or not it has punctuation. This is illustrated in Table 44 for initial na
‘if; when; in order to' clauses and Table 45 for initial mali            'when'   clauses.
Clauses were measured according to the number of nominal arguments and
adjuncts that followed the verb. Clauses that had no NP arguments or adjuncts
following the verb were considered the shortest. They were more likely to lack
punctuation. On the other hand, clauses with two or more full NPs were much
more likely to be followed by punctuation. Whether the punctuation
represents a prosodic boundary cannot be known for certain, but it seems
logical to assume that the longer an adverbial clause is, the more likely it
would be followed by a prosodic boundary in spoken speech.",[400]
"1.2 Geographic and linguistic affiliation of the Barbareno Chumash language
         Barbareno belongs to the Chumashan family of languages. The original
territory of the Chumash people extends along the California coast from a
little beyond San Luis Obispo in the north down to Malibu in the south. It
extends inland, bordering the San Joaquin valley. It also includes the Santa
Barbara Channel Islands, three of which were inhabited year around: Santa
Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel. The Barbareho language itself was spoken
in the present-day Santa Barbara county, roughly in an area from Refugio
Beach to Carpinteria. The last known speaker of Barbareho was Mary Yee,
who died in 1965.
         The word Chumash originates from ehumas ‘islander', a term used
by mainlanders. However, if the word &uma is derived from the same root
as the Barbareno word 2anéum ‘money; shell bead money', as I believe                                        2
it is,’ then the original meaning of the word éhumas has more to do with the
fact that the islanders were the producers of money. The ancestors of the
present-day Chumash had a market economy long before the Europeans
arrived, They used precisely-measured strings of shell-bead money as their
currency. The islanders produced this currency for export and trade to the
mainland. The islands of Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel were mints
in the literal sense of the word. See King 1976, Hudson & Blackburn 1986 and
Arnold 1987 for detailed information on this subject.
          Chumashan has two major branches with at least six languages. Earlier
classifications were later refined in Klar 1973, 1977, 1981, and Mithun 1999,
Known dialectal divisions are given in parentheses.","[24, 25]"
"Such an order would sound odd because the referent for the subject in ' it will
throw (it)' would not have been previously introduced, and thus would not
already be activated in the listener’s consciousness.
        In (21), the neutral clause introduces a full NP, 'a man', whose
referent has Given information status in the remaining two clauses of the text.",[558]
"Their main function is that of qualifying the meaning of the main clause
proposition. These two factors alone, i.e. i) that the adverbial clause does not
have a global role in structuring the discourse and ii) that the adverbial clause
serves mainly in the localized role of qualifying the meaning of the main
clause, are often enough motivation for the adverbial clause to assume a
postposed position. In this sense, the postposed position is the default position
for adverbial clauses. (Since topics and themes come first rather than last, in
the order of topic-comment and theme-rheme, the adverbial clause that is not
serving in a topic-like or theme-like capacity, ie. as a point of orientation,
would most likely be postposed.) There are, however, other factors that
increase the probability of an adverbial clause appearing postposed instead of
preposed: i) referent tracking; ii) an embedded main clause; iii) a main clause
that already has preposed material, such as a topicalized NP or a preposed
adverbial clause; iv) the adverbial clause has the additional function of an
afterthought or reminder; v) the adverbial clause is part of a routinized
construction in which the adverbial clause is always in final position; and
finally, specific to temporal clauses, vi) the adverbial clause codes a terminal
temporal boundary.
         For some of these factors, to understand why they increase the
likelihood that an adverbial clause will be postposed it is helpful to look to the
theory of information flow (Chafe 1976, 1987, 1992, 1994), the principle of
least effort (Zipf 1935) and iconic motivation in language (Haiman 1983), all
of which are interrelated. Considering first the factor of referent tracking, we
saw that an adverbial clause tends to be final if it is tracking a referent that
was introduced (or re-introduced) into the discourse context as a full NP in
the associated main clause. The full NP has New information status in the
main clause, as it is being activated or re-activated in the listener’s
consciousness. In the postposed adverbial clause, the NP acquires Given
status, as it is then already activated in the listener’s consciousness, and the
referent is indexed as a pronominal affix instead of as a full NP. A reversal of
the clausal order would in many cases lead to ambiguity in meaning, as it
would not in all cases be clear who or what was being referred to, by the
pronominal affix, if the adverbial clause were preposed.
        Other factors underscore the importance of conceptual relevance and
(hence) iconic motivation in the ordering of clauses. A clause is more likely                                              553
to be contiguous to the clause whose meaning it qualifies or completes. Thus
in all cases where the main clause was embedded, the adverbial clause was
never preposed. If the main clause in question was a complement clause, the
adverbial ciause did not come between it and its matrix verb. If the main
clause in question was a relative clause, the adverbial clause did not come
between it and its head NP in the matrix clause. In the former case, it would
be infelicitous for the adverbial clause to intervene between the matrix verb
and complement clause, because the complement clause completes the
meaning imparted by the matrix verb, while the adverbial clause adds further
information about the complement clause. In the latter case, it would be
infelicitous for the adverbial clause to intervene between the head NP and
relative clause, because the relative clause provides information that is directly
relevant to the head NP, while the adverbial clause provides information that
is directly relevant to the relative clause. The clausal orders are iconically
motivated in that the clauses most conceptually relevant to each other are
always positioned next to each other. Such iconically motivated clausal orders
should require the least cognitive effort in processing information about the
events and states named by the clauses in question.
        Iconic motivation also has a crucial role in the factor specific to
temporal clauses: in the corpus, temporal clauses that code terminal
boundaries tend to be postposed rather than preposed. The motivation is
iconic in that terminal-boundary temporal clauses code events that happen last
in a given series of events. Hence, the clauses that code them tend to be last
in a given series of clauses. The only exceptions are those that also perform
as pivotal points of orientation, making reference to a prior event and also
providing a context in which a succeeding event occurs. In such cases there is
a competing motivation: terminal events are last in a given series of events
and hence should be coded by final clauses, but pivotal points of orientation
need to be coded first in a given a series of clauses, because they provide
crucial, contextualizing information for the following event(s) or situation(s).
In such cases, the latter motivation takes precedence. So the terminal-
boundary temporal clause, which would otherwise be postposed, has to be
preposed in those cases.
        Adverbial clauses also tend to be final when the associated main clause
already has preposed, associated material, such as a topicalized NP or another
adverbial clause. This preposed, associated material is already doing the task
of setting a scene or otherwise breaking the discourse into thematically-
coherent chunks. It is not necessary (or perhaps even possible) for the
adverbial clause in question to assume that role, so it assumes the postposed                                       354
position. Another possible reason that the adverbial clause is final, in such
cases, is that it might too much of a cognitive burden to have so much
pragmatically-marked material preposed to the main clause, especially in a
      initio! language Uke Darhasohn Chumas
       Finally, adverbial clauses that serve as reminders or afterthoughts are
always final. The order is again iconically motivated in that reminders and
afterthoughts are comments on events and situations that were mentioned in
the preceding context, and the clausal order reflects this by the fact that
reminders and afterthoughts are coded by final clauses.","[575, 576, 577]"

14.0 Introduction
       In the corpus there are 41 adverbial clauses that have the conjunction
kayké 'because, for’. The analogous conjunction for Ineseho Chumash is
ka&a 'because'. The Barbareho conjunction appears to have arisen from
two demonstratives: *k(2)ay and *ke?. It is not known at this point
whether these demonstratives can be reconstructed back to Proto-Chumash.
Harrington found reflexes of both demonstratives in Ineseho: kay          ‘he, she,
it' and ke? 'this; thus, so, in this way' (Applegate 1972a,b). *k( 2) ay does
not have a modern reflex in Barbareho. However, it probably has a historical
connection with the Barbareno proclitic ka=, a reflex of the Proto-Chumash
demonstrative *ka2. The proclitic ka= has several, disparate meanings and
functions:   'staTrvE',   'CONSTRASTIVE FOCUS"",    'RELATIVIZER', 'COMPLEMENTIZER"",
and 'then, so'. The demonstrative *ke2? appears to have a Barbareno reflex
in the interrogative particle ké 'what; whose; why'. Other Barbareho words
that involve a lexicalization of one or both of the old demonstratives *k( 2) ay
and *ke? include Kaykiké 'what', kenG 'why' and nukaké ‘where’.
         In addition to having the conjunction kayké, adverbial clauses of this
type share three characteristics. First, all of the tokens are postposed. Second,
all kayké clauses code a reason (also referred to as 'causal') relation. Third,
the kind of reason relations that tend to be coded by this clause type are
reminiscent of action-based and knowledge-based causal relations (Schiffrin
1987:202), fourth-order and third-order reason relations (Hengeveld 1998) or
causal/reason relations based on internal motivations (Givon 1990:834-835, cf.
also Halliday and Hasan 1976). kKayké clauses that have action-based or
fourth-order readings code reasons for speech acts such as commands,
requests, and claims. These speech acts may be either those of Mary Yee
herself or that of someone Yee is quoting. Kayké clauses that have
knowledge-based or third-order readings code reason relations in which the
modified material (Event 'X') is a conclusion that the speaker has reached
based upon the material coded by the reason clause (Event 'Y'). Finally,
kayké clauses may sometimes code what are referred to as fact-based
(Schiffrin 1987:202), second-order (Hengeveld 1998:345-346) or externally-
motivated (Givén 1990:834) causal relations. In fact-based readings, Event                                         294
 'X' is the direct result of Event 'Y'; Event 'Y' causes Event 'X'. The
line between fact-based and knowledge-based readings is not always clear,
however.

clause is used, the causal relation appears to be treated as self-evident by the
narrator. Another important difference between the reason relations coded by
kayké- and mehu reason clauses is that the latter always code results that are
not willfully intended. Many kayké clauses, on the other hand, code reason
relations that involve some willful intention. Differences between the kayké
and mehu clause types are further explored in chapter 15.
        Illustrations of reason relations coded by kayké clauses are given in
14.1. Following that is a detailed discussion on pronominal subject marking in
14.2 and its subsections. Discontinuous kayké clauses are treated in 14.3.
Highlights of salient patterns are summarized in 14.4.","[315, 316, 317]"

Notes to Chapter 121. Most often when there is a subject pronoun in the nominalized clause, there
is also an intervening particle between the article and the verb stem. This
circumstance always results in the otherwise absent subject pronoun appearing
prefixed on the verb, just as it would be if the verb were not nominalized. If
the nominalized, main clause verbs in lines a., c. and f. were fully inflected to
include person marking, each would lose the article 1= and the glottal stop
nominalizer 2-, and instead have the third person prefix s-. The result would
be *hi=s-iy-2eleé.","[310, 311]"

       <in order that they (unspecified) will not be able to see them.>In the Gukanu clause in d. above, the main verb in the clause, alaqway 'to
be able', lacks the third person subject pronoun s-. If this verb were marked
for person, it would appear as *¢ukanu=s—-am-e-sa?-alaqway. The lack
of the subject pronoun in this verb reflects the fact that the main clause
subject has total control over whether or not the adverbial clause subject will
be able to see the main clause subject. The main clause subject has control by
virtue of wearing the skunk claw talisman, which allows the main clause
subject to be invisible at will. The adverbial clause subject is indexed with the
pronoun     s~      on the complement        verb   in d., kutiy     'to see', but that
pronoun is there because of the particular requirements of the grammar of
complementation in Barbareho; its presence has nothing to do with the main
clause subject in line c.
        The second different-subject Gukanu clause in (7) also retained its
subject pronoun. This clause is reproduced again in (9) below.",[288]

the article 1= in the nominalized verb. There is one type of context in which
this replacement does not occur, and the nominalized clause retains full
subject marking on its verb. If there is a modifier or some kind of particle
preceding the verb, then the article will be attached to that element instead
of the verb. The verb is then inflected for person the same as it would be in
an independent clause. For example, the verbs in (268) and (269) are both
preceded by the particle howo 'still, yet'. In (268) the third person subject
is singular; in (269) the third person subject is plural. In both instances the

declarative clause, a verb within a nominalized clause may or may not have
dependent arguments and adjuncts. Its meaning stays the same regardless of
whether it has dependent arguments and adjuncts. A better illustration of this
point is seen in the pair of nominalized clauses below, which are nearly
identical.(270)      ha-ku      s ams ,utakway

does not have any NP arguments. Both nominalized clauses mean basically the                                                        79
same thing: 'one who was unknown! or 'one who they (indef.) did not
know '. In head-marking languages, especially, NPs that are clausal arguments
further delineate or elaborate upon the information encoded in the head verb.
Thus NPs within nominalized clauses are dependent elements on the verb and

        Nominalized clauses with a first or second person subject are relatively
infrequent in the corpus. Unlike nominalized clauses with a third person
subject, such clauses do not take the article 1=. Also, the pronoun is always
kept: k- if the subject is in first person, or p- if the subject is in second
person. Finally, these clauses always have the prefix -al-. This subordinator
appears mainly in constructions involving focussed or contrasted NPs,
appositions, questions, and relative clauses. Almost always, the subject of the
clause is in the first or second person; exceptions are rare.’ Below are some
examples of nominalized clauses with subjects in the first or second person.","[99, 100, 101, 102]"

         In the corpus there are only 10 adverbial clauses that have the
conjunction mehu 'because, since, from; in order to'. It is possibly a
grammaticized combination of the emphatic particle ne and the remote deictic
morpheme hu. In Harrington’s texts this conjunction is always written as a
proclitic, attached to the verb. In the one example from the Beeler and
Whistler text, it is written as two separate particles, ie. me hu.
         Like the Kayké 'because' adverbial clauses discussed in chapter 14,
almost all mehu clauses code a reason relation with a main clause. However,
though all Kayké clauses occur postposed, 3 of the mehu clauses were found
to be preposed. There are also interesting and subtle differences between
reason clauses coded with a kayké conjunction and reason clauses coded with
a tehu conjunction. The differences have to do with: i) the kinds of causal
relations these adverbial clauses tend to code; ii) the frequency of same-
subject vs. different-subject clauses; iii) pronominal subject marking; and iv)
frequency of human subjects. These topics are dealt with in the subsections of
15.1. One mehu clause was found to code a purposive relation. This token is
discussed in 15.2. In addition to the difference in the kind of semantic relation
it codes relative to the rest of the mehu clauses, it has structural features that
set it apart from the rest. There is one token of a discontinuous mehu
adverbial clause. This is presented in 15.3. Finally, a chapter summary is given
in 15.4.
         Before we get into these issues, however, we will first see an illustration
of a typical inehu adverbial clause, in both initial and final position.
         A preposed mehu clause is given in (1), in line b. The mehu clause
 ""Because they were law-abiding' exists in a reason relation with the set of
clauses in lines c. - e.","[333, 334, 335]"

2.3.3    Nominalized clauses
          Nominalization is a salient feature of the syntax of Chumash languages.
Nominalized clauses commonly serve as subject or object arguments. They are
also often found in relativization, apposition, and in cleft constructions. In this
section I give an overview of the basic structure of a nominalized clause in
Barbareno Chumash. The structure of nominalized clauses in this language is
sensitive to the distinction between third person subjects and first- or second
person subjects. Nominalized clauses with third person subjects are discussed
first, in 2.3.3.1, since the majority of nominalized clauses in my corpus have
third person subjects. Nominalized clauses with first- or second person subjects
are discussed afterward in 2.3.3.2.","[97, 98]"
"1.9.1 Sorting adverbial clauses by structural type
        In the first part of this study I analyzed each of the narrative texts for
adverbial clauses that have one of the following adverbial conjunctions:               2akay hu              ‘until!
               2akimpi               ‘during; while'

       In the coding of temporal relations, those clause types with semantically
specific conjunctions like 2akay    hu   '‘until' and 2akimpi    ‘during, while;
when ' had very little tense and aspectual morphology. These two clause types,
however, generally coded one specific kind of temporal relation: terminal
temporal boundaries for 2akay           hu ‘until’ clauses and simultaneous
temporal relations for 2akimpi 'during, while; when' clauses. On the other
hand, those clause types with semantically general conjunctions like mali
 ‘when' and na ‘if; when; in order to' required a variety of morphemes,
including tense/aspect morphology and words with temporal meaning, in order
to code temporal relations. With such morphology at its disposal, we saw that
the mali   'when'   clause type, especially, could code several different kinds
 of temporal relations--precedence, subsequence, terminal boundaries, initial
boundaries, and simultaneous temporal boundaries. Each of these different
varieties of temporal relations were characterized by different tense and
aspectual morphemes, as well as different temporally-related lexical items.
Relative tense played a key role in coding precedence ('before') and
subsequence ('‘after') temporal relations. An adverbial clause that coded
precedence named an event that was future relative to the event named by
the main clause, and thus tended to have the future tense prefix sa?-. On the
other hand, an adverbial clause that coded subsequence denoted an event that
was past relative to the event denoted by the main clause, and thus tended to
have the past tense suffix -waS. We saw a preponderance of imperfective
aspectual morphology in the coding of simultaneous temporal relations, but
again usually only in those adverbial clauses that lacked semantically specific
conjunctions, such as maii 'when' clauses. Such adverbial clauses, as well as
their main clauses, often had reduplication in the verb, and/or affixes that
denoted duration, iteration, and habitual past. In some instances, certain
temporally-oriented lexical items occurred either in the adverbial clause or in
its main clause in lieu of any tense and aspectual morphology. Such lexical
items rendered a temporal interpretation to the adverbial clause. In other
instances, an adverbial clause was able to code a temporal relation without
any attendant temporally-oriented words and morphosyntax. In such instances
the pragmatic context of the adverbial clause would not allow any other
interpretation.
         Regarding the adverbial clauses that coded conditional relations, one
tended to find one or more modal morphemes in the corresponding main
clauses. These were irrealis operators (using the terminology of Givén 1990)
which served to point to the hypothetical underpinnings of the conditional
relation. These included modal verbs like uniyiw 'to be necessary, to have                                     346
to, should' or alaqway           'can, be able, be possible ', and the modal particle
may    ‘would;      should; might'. One would also find, quite often, the future
tense prefix sa?-. Other modal operators in the consequent (main) clause

 2inu 'true; surely'. Hortatory particles are included here, such as kume ‘let
it not be (that)...'. Sometimes, also, one would find the main clause having an
imperative verb, or the main clause itself would be a question. Finally, main
clauses in conditional relations were sometimes also found to have a special
particle, kimini 'then, in that case', which only occurs in conditional
relations.
         Tense and aspectual morphology was found to be nearly non-existent
in those adverbial clauses that code purpose clauses, with one great exception:
if a purpose clause had any tense/aspect marking, it would have the future
tense prefix sa?-. In fact, for one clause type that codes purposive relations
100% of the time, the Gukanu               'so that, in order to' clause type, the only
tense or aspectual morpheme that appears is the future tense prefix sa?-.
Also, 100% of the purpose clause tokens within the na ‘if; when; in order to'
and fehu       'because, since, from; in order to'                 adverbial clause types had
future tense marking as well. On the other hand, none of the purpose clauses
were found to have past tense marking. Such patterning makes sense given the
crosslinguistic generalization about purposive relations in Thompson and
Longacre 1985: a purpose clause denotes an event that is unrealized at the
time of the event denoted by the main clause. Hence, events in purpose
clauses are typically future relative to the time of the events coded by the
corresponding main clauses. Future-tense morphology or some other kind of
irrealis marking is thus not unexpected in purpose clauses.
         Unlike Barbareno adverbial clauses that code purposive relations,
Barbareno adverbial clauses that code reason relations were rarely found to
have future tense marking. It was not unusual, however, to find past tense
marking in reason clauses. The difference between purpose and reason clauses
with regard to tense patterning is again predicted in Thompson and Longacre
1985: the motivating event coded by a purpose clause has an unrealized status
relative to the main clause event, but the motivating event coded by a reason
clause may indeed already be realized by the time the main clause event
occurs. The event coded by a reason clause, then, can be past relative to the
time of the event coded by its main clause. However, an event coded by a
purpose clause is never past relative to its main clause event; rather, it occurs
in the future relative to the time of its main clause event. Barbareho Chumash                                                 347

Since the subject of the verb s-?ip 'she said' in line h. has not been
previously mentioned in this text, it has to be introduced. Otherwise the
listener would not know who the third pronominal prefix s~ was referring to.
The subject is thus explicitly mentioned in the form of the NP hi=luwisa
 'Luisa'. Since this referent is now activated in the consciousness of the
listener, the temporal clause need only refer to it with the third person subject
prefix s- in s-tikuy-us '(lit.) she talked about it'. Since the temporal
clause only refers to this referent with a pronominal affix, the postposition of
the clause makes it possible for the listener to know immediately who is being
                                           507
referred to (in the temporal clause). If the temporal clause were preposed,
however, it would not be immediately clear to the listener who was being
referred to in the situation ‘when she talked about these songs'.
        For the same reason, ie. ease of processing
                                             Tere
                                               Nh   and information flow, one
would not expect a scenario such as the hypothetical example below,(38) Hypothetical example based on (37) lines h. and i.a.     nali_   s-tikuy-us     hi=he?=1   =niw-niwiS-?       bhi=luwisa

       <When Luisa talked about these songs,>b.     ?i =s-?ip:
       TOP=3-say
       <she said:>
In the above hypothetical example, both the full NPs hi=he?=1=niw-
niwiS-2 ‘these songs' and hi=luwisa 'Luisa' are core arguments of the
verb tikuy-us 'to talk about'. One of them ('Luisa') has not been
mentioned previously and is therefore not already in the listener’s focus of
consciousness. The other core argument (' these songs'), has been mentioned
previously (line f. of (37)), but it has to be re-activated in the listener’s focus
of consciouness because other referents have been mentioned in the
meantime. Situations such as this, where a single utterance has two core
arguments that require activation, create too much of a cognitive-processing
burden for the listener. It is for this reason that, in spoken genres of discourse
crosslinguistically, one rarely finds utterances with two core arguments coded
as full NPs (Du Bois 1987, Mithun 1987, Doris Payne 1987, 1990, Durant and
Ochs 1990). The generalization has likewise been proven true for Barbareno
Chumash (Ono 1996; see also Ono 1996 for a clear discussion of argument
structure, constituent order and information flow in Barbareno Chumash
discourse). The hypothetical scenario in (38), then, would not be a likely
option.","[528, 529, 530]"

       For three other clause types that are postposed or almost always
postposed, Gu        ‘so that, in order to', Gukanu                'so that, in order to’   and
kaheé 'like, as if’, a comma tends to follow the preceding main clause in
three kinds of circumstances: (i) when the main clause is long, having one or
more full NP arguments or adjuncts following the verb; (ii) when there is                                                 385
another clause or prosodically-separate NP intervening between the main
clause and the adverbial clause; or, (iii) when the adverbial clause conjunction
itself introduces a lengthy or discontinuous sequence.
        An example of the situation in (G) is illustrated in (6). In this example
there are two Gu 'so that, in order to' clauses. The first one is in line d. and
is not preceded by a comma. Its preceding main clause in line c. is short, with
only a single verb. The second éu clause appears in line g. A comma
intervenes between it and its preceding main clause, which has three full NPs.","[407, 408]"
"         Dependent marking with hi= almost never occurs on adverbial clause
types that are always or almost always postposed. For example, it is never
found procliticized to the following adverbial clause conjunctions: 2akay hu
 ‘until’, 2iyeme ‘though; even if', Gu ‘so that, in order to', Gukanu 'so
that, in order to' or Mehu           ' because, since, from; in order to'. One notable
exception is the kaneé 'like, as, as if' clause type. Although 13 out of 15
kaheé clause tokens are postposed, two of the postposed tokens have
dependent marking with hi=. These are given below in (13) and (14).",[393]

                                       Chapter 13                            ku ‘lest; so that...not' Clauses         Thompson and Longacre (1985:188) note that some languages have a
special conjunction for negative purpose clauses. An example in English is the
negative purpose conjunction ‘lest '. In Barbarenho Chumash, that conjunction
is ku 'lest, so that..not'. The Ku adverbial clause type is rare, with only two
tokens in the corpus. Yet, it is worth a brief discussion because it shares some
semantic space with negated Gu 'so that, in order to' purposive clauses
(chapter 11) as well as with haku '‘if' conditional clauses (chapter 7).
         The ku conjunction probably has a historical connection with the
conjunction haku 'if', found in conditional and semantically neutral relations.
Adverbial clauses with the conjunctions ku and haku are alike in that both
clause types code unreal, hypothetical situations. But whereas haku clauses
may code a condition, ku clauses code the purpose of the main clause
subject’s action. Specifically with ku clauses, the purpose of the main clause
subject’s action is to avoid an undesirable situation.
         It is not entirely clear what the difference in meaning would be for a
purpose clause that has the ku conjunction versus a clause that has the Gu
 'so that, in order to' conjunction and the negative prefix e-. In line c. of the
first example below, Mary Yee offered two ways of saying a purposive clause
in which these two conjunctions were contrasted. Harrington noted that these
minimal pairs were ‘carefully contrasted' (59.0586), but he did not state
whether Yee preferred one over the other.","[311, 312]"

         Not all main clauses that have negation or some other irrealis operator,
such as an imperative mode in the verb or the future tense prefix sa?~, have
a Su adverbial clause that has the future tense prefix.* With only 5 of the 53
tokens of Gu clauses showing the future tense prefix, it is difficult to know
what accounts for its presence. As we will see in chapter 12, all of the Gukanu
 ‘so that, in order to' clauses have the future tense prefix. The difference in
frequency of the future tense prefix is thus one of the major morphosyntactic
differences between these two purposive adverbial clause types.
       Of the 53 u clauses, 12 or 23% have the negative prefix e-. They
always translate with the phrase 'so that... not..'. These adverbial clauses
tend to be associated with main clauses that code deontic necessity. That is,
the participant coded as the main clause subject is obliged to do something in
order to avoid an unpleasant result. In most cases, the main clause subject is
second person singular, indexed on the verb with the second person prefix p-.
The main clause will also typically have the modal verb uniyiw 'to be
necessary, to have to, should' as well as the future tense prefix sa?-.
Illustrations of this pattern are given in (20) through (22).
        The main clause in (20) line c. states what one ought to do if beans fell
on the floor. The Gu purpose clause in line d. has the negative prefix e-.","[275, 276]"

clauses by position and semantic relation. All tokens are from the 13 adverbial
clause types analyzed in chapters 4 through 16.","[365, 366, 367]"
"23.2.1.2 Referent tracking in the adverbial clause
        There are two tokens in which the main clause introduces a New
referent that continues to be tracked in the neutral adverbial clause as Given.
As we saw with final temporal clauses in chapter 22, the preferred order in
such circumstances is for the adverbial clause to be postposed, for reasons of
information flow and ease of cognitive processing.
        In (26) and (27), the associated main clause introduces a full NP that
is coded as a third person subject in the adverbial clause with the third
pronominal prefix, s-. In (26), the main clause (line c.) introduces the
possessor NP 'a frog', whose referent is then coded as the subject in the
adverbial clause, ‘if/when it is angry’.",[564]
"1.4 Previous analyses of Barbareno Chumash*
        A truly thorough description of the Barbareho Chumash language has
yet to appear, but one may find a clear and concise orientation to Barbareno                                      4
discourse and grammar in Ono’s 1996 dissertation. Sketches and analyses of
the Barbareno language are also found in Beeler 1970a and 1976, and in the
extensive, detailed footnotes given in Beeler and Whistler 1980. Detailed
discussions on dependent marking, relative clauses and related structures are
given in Wash 1999a and 1999b. There are also discussions and illustrative
examples touching upon many aspects of Barbareho grammar in Harrington’s
notes, especially in Reel 3, Volume 3, of the Kraus Microfilm Reel Edition
(Mills and Brickfield 1986). In addition to these sources there are two articles
on the placement and functions of glottalization (Mithun et al. 1994, Ono et
al. 1994). Two studies have been published on sibilant harmony in Barbareho
(Beeler 1970b, Mithun 1997). Finally, there is a phonological study on
reduplication, which is a prominent phonological and grammatical process in
all Chumash languages (Wash 1995).
        No comprehensive dictionary of the Barbareno language has yet been
published. However, Beeler (1979) published a list of approximately 1,000
words, Whistler (1980) followed up on this work with a working dictionary
containing about 2,000 words. There is also a helpful glossary of terms from
several different Chumash languages. in volume five of the Hudson and
Blackburn (1986) series.","[26, 27]"

       <in order to vomit from it and get diarrhea from it.>The main clause subject 'we', in line a., can willfully drink ocean water, but
once they do so, they presumably cannot control the vomiting and diarrhea
that they inevitably undergo in line b. Because the main clause subject lacks
control, the person marking in the adverbial clause is not suppressed. Hence
the adverbial clause retains same-subject person marking with k-iy- 'we'.
        The example in (6) is the only other same-subject construction in which
the subject pronoun is retained in the adverbial clause. In the excerpt below,
                                            262
the main clause subject ingests some datura (also known as jimson weed) in
order to have a particular kind of vision, a vision in which he or she may
receive an 2atiSwin         (spirit helper), a special talent, or some other
advantage. The main clause subiect has no control over what he or she will
experience or receive in the adverbial clause event. According to Chumash
tradition, it is the datura (momoy) that determines what the person
experiences and receives during the vision. In the example below, the main
clause subject is an indefinite third person 'one/they', coded with the third
person subject pronoun s- and the indefinite prefix am- in line a. This same
pronoun likewise occurs in the adverbial clause in line b.","[284, 285]"
