6. 1.2 Interrogative clauses and the word order offocus
   The word order of interrogative clauses differs from that of declarative clauses. In an
interrogative clause an interrogative pronoun (illustrated here with amo 'who') will appear in
the preverbal focus position. This is true even if the referent of the question word is the
subject of the clause, and mirrors the ordering of constituents under focus in questions,
mentioned above.
   (249)    Tra              bie     amo b-ei?
            sago.delight.NM that     who QSG-do
            [ OBJ ]          [SUBJ] [VERB]
            'Who made that sago delight?'
    An A-P-V order is not possible when the subject is a question-word pronoun:
88      Chapter 6     (250)     *amo tra ble bei?
   This suggests that there is a structural position for pragmatically prominent core elements
of the clause, which is immediately preverbal, a phenomenon not uncommon in SOV
languages. Note that a questioned oblique still occurs in the normal postverbal position:
     (25 1 )   Sit  b-akale kaung-ri?
               sago 2SG-wrap what-INSTR
               'What will you wrap the sago with?'
   Combined with the topic position data seen in §6 . 1 . 1 , the adjunct nominal information
from §5 . 3 .2, and the knowledge we have about the position of oblique arguments in I'saka
(see §6. 1 ), we can conclude that the phrase structure is as seen in (252):

6. 1. 1 Declarative word order
   The basic order of elements in a declarative sentence is SOY, with Oblique participants
(including those that may be encoded on the verb by the dative suffix) appearing after the
verb (these include nominals bearing the following semantic roles: instrument, companion,
recipient, beneficiary, goal, and location, and also possessor of P). If more than one oblique
is present, then goal and location will follow other peripheral arguments. Temporals are
usually clause-initial.
   (23 5)   S 0    TIME    NPSUBJ    NPOBJ     V NPASSOC, BEN, REC, INSTR NPGOAL, LOC
   None of these elements are obligatory. Some examples of the practical consequences of
these rules governing word order are exemplified in (236}-(240) below.
            Postverbal oblique:

               'Yesterday I cooked this sago delight for/with my mum. '
               Instrument precedes locations:
     (240)     Depu               d-ele '-le '  yang-ri        I 'saka i '.
               1 SG.NOM           1 SG-gO-<IRR> leg-INsTR      Krisa village

               'I 'll walk to Krisa village.'
   Deviations from the word order presented here are rare, although preverbal constituents
are occasionally found either at the end of the clause for emphasis, or in the pragmatically
marked preverbal 'focus' position in which elements are pragmatically salient, and, with the
exception of nominals or pronouns that simply double a clause-external topic, do appear to be
necessarily focused. This is most commonly found if that constituent is the answer to a
content question. Furthermore, there is a pre-sentential topic position, which is filled with
any NP (subject, object, or an oblique) from the clause. The topic NP in the main clause can
optionally be doubled in the clause, in the preverbal focus position (unless the clause contains
another argument with the pragmatic function 'focus').
     (24 1 )   S'   �    NPTO P S(lNP)
    Note that an NP in the topic position retains its normal case-marking possibilities, as seen
in the following examples:
               SUBJ as topic:
     (242)     Dapu,      a       hIe dapu        n-ou.
               1 SG.NOM pig.M that 1 SG.NOM 1 SG-eat
               'Me, I want to eat (some of) that pork.'
     (243)     Dupu,    kelia       n-oru .
               1 PL.NOM yesterday 1 PL-come
               'We came yesterday.'
               OBI as topic:
  (244)        Kie,         amo m-a?
               3SG.M.ACC who QSG-hit
               'And him, who hit him?'
                                                                                   Syntax     87   (244)'   *kie, amo kie rna ?
   (244)' is ungrammatical because the question word amo already appears in the preverbal
focus position, and so it is impossible for the topic to be doubled there. The examples below
show that even an oblique, if it is doubled, appears in the preverbal focus position, not in the
expected postverbal oblique position. Note that an instrument, which is normally marked not
just by postverbal position but also by the case marker -ri, when topic ali sed requires that a
pronoun remain behind in the original position to carry the case marking.
            OBL location as topic:
   (245)    ['      bie, nesing i'       s-eie '-ie'.
            village that I DU village I Du-go-RED
            'That village, we two're going there. '
            OBL instrument a s topic:
   (246)    D6 bie tei d-akai omu-ri.
            axe this tree l SG-cut 3SG.NM-INSTR
            'This axe, I chop trees with it (her). '
   (247)    P6i     bie a d-o             omu-ri.
            arrow this pig l SG-shoot 3SG.NM-INSTR
            'That arrow, that I shoot pigs with it (her).'
   (247)'   *d6 bie tei dakai
   (247)"" *d6-ri bie tei dakai
    If the topic can appear repeated in the preverbal 'focus' position (because there is no other
specified focused element), then overt case marking there (as nominative or accusative)
licenses a pronoun in topic position to be unmarked for case:
   (248)    Mama, bi           k-eiei  ya ?
            2SG     2SG.ACC 3SG.M-see COMP
            'And you, did he see you?'
  The preverbal focus position is shown in the following section.","[103, 104, 105]"
"
5.2. 1 Morpheme ordering
   Morphemes are strictly ordered in the verb in I'saka, though the reduplicative element
used to mark irrealis mood applies a template to a segmental string that includes both the root
and the prefix. Section 5 .7.1 discusses some variation in the order of the final morphemes in
this verbal string with sentence final particles. The order of the different morphemes on the
verb is as follows:
                SUBJ-VROOT(.OBJ) - (Human OBJ), (EVID) - (DAT)
                       « IRR»
   Subject is obligatorily encoded either prefixally or through suppletion of the verb root,
with different verb stems being used for subjects of differing number or gender. The most
extreme example of this is the verb 'do', which uses apparently completely unrelated forms
- see Table 26. Objects are encoded either suppletively (in which case they determine the
vowel of the syllable reduplicated for irrealis verbs - see §2.4 and §2 . 5 ), or suffixally. It is
not known whether human object suffixes are placed before or after the evident morpheme,
though the semantics of the evident morpheme and the limited class of verbs that can take
human object suffixes would not appear to be compatible. The dative suffix is always placed
word-finally, as in the examples below, which show the dative suffix in combination with the
human object suffix in (99), and the evident temporallrealis morpheme combined with the
dative suffix in (100) (there is, however, some doubt as to the status of the dative suffix as
suffix or as clitic: see § 5 .7.1).
58      Chapter 5     (99)      Nai m-opa-ke-na.
               boy 2SG-carry.on.shoulder-3sG.M.H.OBJ- 1 SG.DAT
               'You're carrying my son (on your shoulders). '
     ( 1 00)   Nana yoko d-epe-re-ka                        duwe.
               l SG    stone l SG-put-EvID- 3SG.M.DAT dog.M
               'I threw a stone at the dog (and hit him). '
   All verbs must inflect for subject, in all syntactic environments, using the paradigm shown
in §5 .2.2. There is a suffix that marks object, seen in (99), but it is extremely restricted
lexically, and so cannot be thought of as fully productive and is certainly not obligatory on
verbs (for further details, see §5.2.3). The only other productive agreement marking on verbs
is the set of dative suffixes, which index a non-core argument of varying semantic
relationships and are extremely frequent. The different types of morphology are described in
the sections that follow.","[75, 76]"

6. 1. 4 Noun phrase order
   The order of elements in the noun phrase is tightly constrained; when sequences of NP­
elements appear outside this normal ordering, the usual interpretation is that they are not
actually an NP unit, but rather an NP + predicate. Of course, if there is a further predicate,
then the ill-ordered string renders the sentence ungrammatical, or at best the result of false
starts.
   Normal (that is, non-elicited) discourse rarely presents any adjectives or relative clauses as
modifiers in the NP (though possessives and demonstratives are not unusual). It is certainly
the case that an NP with all four of the positions listed below have never been attested, nor
are we claiming that they are possible. Based on the observed orders of elements in smaller
NPs, however, we can formulate the normal order of elements in the NP:
     (26 1 )   NP 0     N    ADJ RC/NUM        POSS/DEM
   In many cases the possessor is not marked inside the NP, but rather on the verb of the
clause in the form of dative suffixes. Deictics and possessive pronouns must be placed after
the noun they modify, and following any numerals, but are freely ordered with respect to
each other.
   Examples of NPs illustrating these various types of modifiers can be found in the
following clauses (note the variant nua for the more common nuo 'big'):
               N - ADJ - DEM
     (262)     A        nua hie d-o-ma .
               pig.M big this l SG-shoot-2SG.DAT
               'I shot this big pig of yours. '
               N - ADJ - NUM
     (263)     a       nua sia.
               pig.M big two
               'two big pigs'
               (Note that many modifiers, especially numerals, appear most naturally
               separated from the head noun, following the verb, as described in §6. 1 .3 .)
               N - RC
     (264)     B-au,     a        nua [d-o            kelie]    sesing.
               2SG-come pig.M big         l SG-shoot yesterday 1 DU:eat-RED
               'Come on, let's eat that large pig I shot yesterday. '
   Relative clauses have not been observed in conjunction with other modifiers in the NP;
attempts to elicit this sort of structure have been met with biclausal translations, such as 'The
                                                                                    Syntax      91big pig there, I shot it yesterday. Let's eat it'. More information on relative clauses is in
§6.8.","[108, 109]"

            Abbreviations and conventions
     The usual conventions for glossing first, second and third person as 1 , 2 and 3 have been
followed. A, S and P have been used descriptively to represent the syntactic roles of most
agentive arguments of a primary transitive verb (and other arguments that pattern as it does),
single argument of an intransitive predicate, and most patientive argument of a primary
transitive verb (and other arguments that pattern as they do), respectively, following Comrie
( 1 978) and Andrews ( 1 985:6 8). The following additional abbreviations are used in the text
and in glosses of examples:  ACC          accusative                          N      weak phonetic nasalisation

Xli   Abbreviations   Standard glossing conventions are used to break up vernacular text and its equivalent on
the morpheme line: the hyphen '- ' is used to separate morphemes forming one phonological
                       ,
word, and a space ' is used to mark off separate words. Punctuation marks are used
according to English conventions. The usual star ' *' is used to indicate an ungrammatical

6.1 Word order   rsaka clauses and phrases exhibit a quite strict word order, though there are pragmatic
alternatives for many constructions. This section starts with an overview of clausal word
order, and then proceeds into noun phrases. This order of presentation has been chosen to
follow the possibilities for adjectives, which can in many instances appear outside the NP of
the noun they modify.",[103]

                     Figure 10: Subgrouping based on pronominal evidence     The regular sound changes, evidenced in part in the data seen in Table 30, are not clear
enough to posit a subgroup that joins the Serra Hills and Piore River groups together, and so
the tree presented in Figure 3 has shown these two groups, along with the Skou group, as
sisters. On the other hand the phonological changes do suggest that I'saka forms a first-order
subgroup within the family.
 1 0 Word lists and list of
                grammatical morphemes    No lexicographic materials are available in popular print for the I'saka language, and it is
unlikely that they will appear in the near future. Partly in order to counter this dearth of
materials, we have included some word lists of the basic elements of the language.
    We have presented a comprehensive basic word list in § 1 0. 1 , followed in § 1 0.2 by several
lists of species names and natural world terms. These are words which have been recorded by
Willy Wou Wake, of Krisa village. Some of these terms were not checked, and have been
presented in Willy's orthography as he wrote it. These are listed in a different font,
appearing sans serif: the word list that has been checked appears in italics, as a checked
form, following the conventions used for transcribing other I'saka sentences in this book.
    Following this is an alphabetically sorted list of these same words, and a short summary
of the grammatical morphemes in the language, including references to where they are
discussed.","[126, 127]"

6. 1.3 Ordering of adjectives
   Adjectives exemplify a more complex and changeable set of ordering rules, with speakers
varying with respect to adjective usage. Essentially, in addition to appearing inside the NP in
which a nominal occurs, an adjective can also be found postverbally; this is a quite frequent
strategy. The two options for word order can be seen in the following sentences. In the first
sentence we can see an NP with both the noun and the adjective inside it. I t occurs
preverbally, as we would expect of a P.
     (253)     INP A     nuo ] k-ani-ung                Ros.
                  pig.M big       3SG.M-give-3sG.NM.DAT Rose
               'He gave a big pig to Rose.'
  The next sentence also has an element which is translated as 'big pig', but in this case the
noun a 'pig' occurs preverbally, and the adjective is found postverbally:
     (254)     Daka asongpa INP a ]         k-o             �DJ nuo].
               Man stealth(y)       pig.M 3SG.M-do.SG.M.OBJ     big
               'The stealthy man shot a big pig.'
  This section shall discuss the possibilities and restrictions of this split-modification
construction.
                                                                                   Syntax      89   In monovalent clauses, a subject-linked adjective occupies the peripheral (i.e. non­
subcategorised) postverbal slot, functioning as a secondary predicate (25 5):
   (255)    D-elel asongpa nil.
            l SG-go stealth(y) INTENSE
            'I go along, very stealthily. '
   In realis bivalent clauses a subject-linked adjective i s placed i n the noun phrase with the
subject, and the object-linked adjective fills the postverbal position, as seen earlier in (254).
We can thus conclude that the ability of an adjective to appear in a postverbal position is
dependent on the nominal that it refers to being the S or the P of the clause, that is, an
absolutive argument. This can be shown to be the case by examining the following clauses,
using the quantifier purupa 'all, complete' in a postverbal position. The first sentence has a
singular subject, so the interpretation of the quantifier as modifying the P is not surprising. In
the second clause, daka u is the only argument of the monovalent clause, and so the
interpretation is not in question.
   (256)    Su     n-ou      purupa.
            sago 1 SG-eat all
            'I ate all the sago. '
   (25 7)   Dakau onde purupa .
            children go.PL all
            'All of the children went.'
   This third clause shows a plural A and a potentially (and pragmatically likely) plural P; the
postverbal quantifier can only be interpreted as modifying the P, not the A, showing that this
quantification applies to an absolutive grouping: S and P, as opposed to A.
   (258)    Dakau su        oung purupa.
            children sago eat       all
            'The children ate all of the sago.'
            *'All of the children ate the sago. '
   It should be noted, however, that if a peripheral argument is already present postverbally,
both subject and object-linked adjectives must occur in the NP of the argument that binds
them, as seen in (25 3). One example, however, shows both a postverbal nominal and a
postverbal adjective: the post-verbal nominal is the apparent P of the sentence, but the scope
of the adjective is over the chaser duwe, not the chased yung-paul. This is evidence that the
clause is monovalent, not bivalent, and the nominal yung-pa ul is a true oblique, and not
simply an obliquely-coded P.
   (259)    Duwe abli yung-paul            amopa.
            dog     chase bird-chicken many
            'Lots of dogs are chasing after the chicken.'
   The following example illustrates the apparent unacceptability (at least prescriptively) of a
preverbal object-linked adjective when the postverbal position is empty.
   (260)    *depu       su     takau n-ou
            l SG.NOM sago hot        l SG-eat
            'I ate hot sago. '
90      Chapter 6   Although the above pattern is robustly attested (particularly the postverbal placement of
object-linked adjectives), exceptions have been observed. More data is necessary to be sure
of the rules of adjective placement, particularly with reference to the ordering of deictics and
possessive pronouns, and the presence of additional tense/aspect information (e.g. irrealis or
completive morphemes) in the clause. The current data suggests that all these elements are
relevant to adjective ordering.","[106, 107, 108]"

6. 1.5 Non-verbal predicates
   The word order in non-verbal predicates parallels that found in verbal predicates in terms
of the functions of the elements of the clause. The predicative noun or adjective is found in
the same final position, just as the verb is in verbal clauses, and the subject of the predicate is
again in initial position.
   Examples of these predicates have already been given in the sections on nouns and
adjectives, and some additional examples are shown in the following sentences:
   (265)    Kia    sami dina.
            3SG.M WF       I SG.POSS
            'He's my father-in-law.'
   (266)    Ongni dina       bua       wini-ka.
            MBW I SG.POSS woman MB-3SG.M.DAT
            'My aunt by marriage is a (my) mother's brother's wife.'
   Numerous other examples can be found elsewhere in the grammar.",[109]
"
10. 1 Basic I'saka word list
   The following list of basic lexemes is given as a guide to the lexical diversity of the
language, and as an aid to comparative work. It is not intended to be exhaustive (nor is it),
but it does contain a good deal of lexical material that is not accessible through other sources,
and so represents a valuable contribution to studies of New Guinea languages.
   The list has been arranged by semantic fields, and is intended to cover as much of a basic
survey word list as possible, with these items appearing first within each semantic domain,
followed by a selection of more specialised items. Verbs appear inflected for first person
singular, with the prefix d- or, if the initial syllable of the verb root is nasalised, n- (§5.2.2),
since this makes the representation of nasalisation in an initial syllable most simple. Where
known, the gender of the noun has been indicated, with masculine nouns marked by 'M ', and
non-masculine marked with 'NM '. All examples appear in the orthography described in §2.7;
the phonological forms may be reconstructed from these orthographic representations with no
ambiguities.
   The abbreviations used in the section on kin terms follow standard anthropological usage,
and can be summarised as follows: C - child, D - daughter, e - elder, F - father, H - husband,
M - mother, P - parent, S - son, Si - sibling, ss - same-sex, os - opposite sex, Sp - spouse,
W - wife, y - younger, Z - sister. These may be used in combinations such that each operator
applies t9 the following term. As an examples of this, the gloss CSp for duwoko indicates
that the term can be used for a child's spouse. Some terms cover reference of what would be
                                                1 09
1 10    Chapter 1 0conceived of as two separate categories in English, such as PP, CC yani', which covers both
grandparents (of either sex, thus in English both grandfather and grandmother) and
grandchildren. Clearly the relevant characteristic in I ' saka is that the referent is two
generations removed from Ego.
   The following word list is organised into the following categories (in order of
presentation): Body parts, Humans and kin terms, Pronouns, Animals, Plants, Natural world,
Human artefacts, Location, Colours, Counting, Properties, Verbs, Miscellaneous.","[127, 128]"
"                                                1 04
                                                           Irregular verb paradigms         1 05   The plural of the verb 'go' is found in two forms. In addition to, for instance, yore ', the
form yinore ' has also been recorded. The meaning difference, if any, between these two
forms is not known. The similarity of the root for 'go' in I'saka to the cognate forms in Skou
(re) makes it very likely that the apparently prefixal in- has historically borne some function,
which might possibly have been lost, or else fused into the root, in the case of the 3PL form.
   It is worth pointing out that some of the verb forms described here show some degree of
mUltiple exponence of agreement marking for subject. This is particularly noticable with the
verbs of going. For example, when the 2PL form of the verb is given as yinore ', the
morphological breakdown of the verb must be something like the following:
   (303)   yinore'
           yi-n-ore'
           2PL-PL-go.PL
           'You all went.'
   The mUltiple marking of the same features, or subsets of the same set of features, at
different points in a verb is common to other members of the Skou family (though it is by no
means universal). I t has been described in Skou (Donohue 1 999b) and Barupu (Donohue
2003), and has also been observed, with pragmatic functions, in Puare (Donohue's
fieldnotes, 2002).
9            Comparison with related
             languages    As mentioned in § 1 . 3 , there are no languages with a particularly close linguistic
relationship to I'saka. Despite this lack of near siblings, I'saka is demonstrably a member of
the Macro-Skou family, as has been seen in Figure 3, and numerous cognates and
paradigmatic matches can be found with languages in other, more populous, branches of this
family (see Donohue 2002a, to appear). In this section some of the similarities between
I'saka and various of the other languages of the family will be described.
    Recall from Figure 3 in § 1 . 3 that I'saka is a first-order subgroup within the Macro-Skou
family. As such, there are not many cognates with any one language from the other branch
of Macro-Skou, but taken as a whole there are quite a few. Table 30 presents a non­
exhaustive list of representative examples, with the non-I'saka words shown in IPA .","[122, 123, 124]"
"
5. 7.5 Dubitative
   The dubitative marker wo is found at the end of clauses as a marker of uncertainty on the
part of the speaker about the truth of the utterance. It may be used as a marker of
evidentiality, to indicate that the speaker is not vouching for the veracity of the statement, or
it may be a marker of uncertainty about the future plausibility of the sentence:
     (23 3)     Tra           bima       ble nu ble w-oung            wo . . .
                sago.delight 2SG.POSS that girl that 3SG.NM-eat DUB
                'That sago delight of yours, that girl might have eaten it (I think;
                but I don't know either). '
     (234)      Bala      tu-tu              wo . . .
                tomorrow 3SG.NM.come-RED DUB
                'She might come tomorrow (but I 'm not sure).'
    As indicated in the examples above, the dubitative particle is often lengthened, [WJ:::] .
Further, it is associated with a slow down-gliding intonation contour, both on the particle
itself and to a lesser extent on the rest of the preceding clause. An additional example of this
particle, in a richer context, can be seen in the text in §7.4.
6           Syntax
   In this section we shall discuss various basic elements of the syntax of rsaka that are not
easily described in terms of morphological possibilities or morphological restriction. These
include the word order of elements of the clause and of the noun phrase, and some simple
features of clausal conjunction. By no means are the syntactic structures of rsaka
completely described in this section, but rather only a small and immediately salient selection
of constructions are presented, selected more for their frequency of appearance than
necessarily for their typological unusualness.","[102, 103]"
"
6. 4. 1 Adjacency
   Subject or object nominals may be conjoined through adjacency in the clause, provided
that, where appropriate, the verb shows agreement for the sum of the features represented by
both constituents. In the first example below the subject of the monovalent verb is the two
nouns moni and tani; they are conjoined in the NP by adjacency, and the verb agrees with the
combined dual category.
   (274)    Moni' tani' s-eZe '     AwakaZi.
            mother father 3DU-go Vanimo
            'Mum and dad are going to Vanimo. '
   The following example shows two nouns conjoined as the object of the clause. Since
objects do not show any agreement (other than the limited set of 'envelopment' verbs and the
light verbs 'do' and 'get' - §5.2.3), there is no overt indication of the shared phrase structure
of the two nouns.
   (275)    Sit     wesie n-ou.
            sago greens I SG-eat
            'I ate sago and greens.'
  The dative argument in a clause behaves similarly to the subject, with respect to behaviour
when conjoined: simple apposition is enough, with no overt conjunction being required, as in:
   (276)    D-ele '-le '-sa         ba '           pungo
            1 SG-go-RED-3DU.DAT elder.sibling younger.sibling
            'I'm going to my brother and sister. '
   In addition to these strategies, it is also possible to conjoin dative nominals with the
postpostion tro, described in the following section and in §5. 1 .2 and §6 .7, necessarily
following the verb.
94      Chapter 66. 4.2 Postpositional accompaniment
   Subject or object NPs may be conjoined using the postposition tro 'with' . The behaviour
of the conjunct differs depending on the syntactic role it bears. A second non-subject noun
phrase may appear as a modifier to the first object, in the preverbal object NP position, as in:
     (277)     Wesie sit      tro n-ou.
               tulip sago with 1 SO-eat
               'I ate greens and sago. '
  Alternatively, the conjunct may appear as an oblique argument in the postverbal oblique
position, as in:
     (278)     Sit    n-ou     wesie tro.
               sago 1 SO-eat tulip with
               'I ate sago with greens. '
   When a subject argument consisting of two nominals appears with one conjunct marked
by tro, the second noun must be coded as an oblique argument, and appear in the postverbal
oblique position, as in the following examples.
     (279)     Ba      dina      sit   k-oung   nana tro.
               brother I so.poss sago 3S0.M-eat I so with
               'My brother ate sago with me. '
     (280)     Tani' k-ele '     moni' tro pll.
               father 3S0.M-go mother with garden
               'Dad went to the garden with mum. '
   Notice that the verbs in these cases do not inflect for the combined dual number, but
rather only show agreement for the person, number and gender of the preverbal �rgument in
the subject NP. This suggests that the postverbal NP is in fact truly an oblique, since the
agreement does not include it, as it did with the simple adjacency conjunction type seen in
§6.4. 1 . This suggests that it is not possible for a tro-marked oblique to modify a noun in
an NP if the NP is the subject of the clause, but only if it is the object.
   There is some evidence to suggest whether or not it is permissible to link two subject
nominals with tro on the same side of the verb. The unacceptability of (28 1 ) below may be
partly caused by the attempt at subject co-ordination, but in truth we would expect this
sentence to be ungrammatical in any case, as the verb is inflected for the first person subject
only.
     (28 1 )   *nana ba        dina        tro sit n-ou
                I so  brother I so.poss with sago I SO-eat
               'My brother and 1 ate sago. '
     Even with non-singular number agreement, the sentence is still ungrammatical:
     (282)     *nana ba        dina       tro sit sing
                I so  brother I so.poss with sago 1 DU:eat
               'My brother and 1 ate sago.'
   This sentence makes it clear that a tro-marked accompaniment is not grammatical in a
preverbal position.
                                                                                 Syntax     956.5 Clause chaining
   Adjacent verbs may sometimes share constituents, even when they do not form a serial
verb construction. Object noun phrases are normally obligatory in bivalent clauses, but may
be omitted if the clause immediately prior has the same object. Intonation patterns show that
these are distinct clauses, rather than serial verbs:
   (283)    Sit    d-ai,   n-ou.
            sago l SG-get l SG-eat
            'I got some sago, and ate [it]. '
   I n the following sentence the oblique argument i s represented by a full independent
pronoun in the second clause, even though it is completely recoverable from the verbal
agreement:
   (284)    Sani      b-o        n-rlni-ma                     mama.
            like.that 2SG-do.M l SG-be.angry.at-2sG.DAT 2SG
            'If you behave like that, I 'll be cross at you. '
   The following example shows that the clause-final completive particle y a may also be
shared over two clauses. Again, we see the object noun phrase omitted in the second clause:
   (285)    Sit    bima       ble d-akai, n-ou         ya .
            sago 2SG.POSS that l SG-cut l SG-eat COMP
            'I prepared that sago of yours, and ate [it]. '
  It is, of course, possible to link two monovalent clauses. The following sentence shows
two clauses with a shared oblique nominal, appearing final in the chain of verbs:
   (286)    Dapu       d-ele ' d-iy         wfysau pule.
            l SG.NOM l SG-go l SG-sleep forest bush.camp
            'I went and slept in the bush camp. '
   Another option for linking clauses involves the use of the sequential marker -pa (see also
the texts in Chapter 7). This can be seen in the following textual extracts:
   (28 7)   D-ele ' asong-pa       nil,         tau d-ei      mi.
            l SG-go stealthy-SEQ INTENSE noise l SG-do NEG
            'I went along very stealthily, I didn't make any noise.'
   (288)    Dapu       d-ele' pli-pa        dapu      Wl d-akai,         d-ele ' wfysau.
            l SG.NOM l SG-go road-SEQ l SG.NOM river l SG-cross l SG-go forest
            'I went along the road, then I crossed the river and went into the forest. '
   A phonologically identical conjunction is found, with various uses, in Skou, Nyao and
Wutung, genetically rather distantly related languages found to the immediate north-west and
west of Krisa. The fact that the cognate conjunction shows a Ipl in Wutung and Nyao, where
we would espect Itfl, and the lack of any evidence for this morpheme in any other related
languages, points to some evidence for the spread of this morpheme involving diffusion
rather than simple descent (Nyao also displays the case marker -tJi in a role that -pa is found
with in Skou, marking an instrument. This would be the expected cognate for a Proto Skou
form *pV . Skou also has a light verb fa 'make use of', which might be cognate, but for
which there is no comparative support).
96      Chapter 6     Clauses marking purpose or reason are not marked in any particular way:
     (289)     Nana d-ele ' ubiy             n-afung, d-alai              ya,     Wl.

and this is discussed in the following section.","[111, 112, 113, 114]"

                                                I'saka is the language spoken in the village of Krisa. It is also spoken in the off-shoot
                                             settlement at Pasi, four hours' walk north near the coast and c loser to government
                                             administration, and also at numerous temporary bush camps about the plateau lands near
                                            Mount Asowa, which is the centre of the range of hunting and gathering for the people of
                                            Krisa village. The language is endangered in all senses of the word, inconsistently used in
                                            this one village, and sparsely used outside it. Close by in the larger population centre of
                                            Vanimo, different languages are spoken. Tok Pisin, the lingua franca of most of Papua
                                            New Guinea, has supplanted most of the traditional functions of I'saka. Nonetheless, I'saka
                                            still serves as an icon of the separateness and identity of the Krisa people (§ 1 .3 .2), and is still
                                            being passed on.
                                                This is the first linguistic documentation of the I1saka language. Laycock ( 1 973)
                                            tentatively classifies that language, which he calls Krisa , along with Rawo, Puari and
                                            Warap u (now known as Puare and Barupu), as members of the Krisa branch of the
                                            Sko phylum. In the light of more recent research this classification is not tenable: although
                                            the languages are all related to each other, as well as to the closely related languages of the
                                            coastal strip from Pasi to the Skou villages across the border into Papua, it is in a very
                                            different configuration to that proposed by Laycock (the classification that is followed here
                                            is described in § 1 . 3). Since the publication of Laycock ( 1 973), there have been occasional
                                            references in print to the position of I'saka within his classification, but no material on or
                                            references to the language have appeared, other than Donohue and San Roque (2000), and
                                            San Roque (200 1 ).
                                                The language of the people who live in Krisa village is more properly known as I'saka,
                                            the name preferred by native speakers, and also a name that is phonotactically possible in the
                                            language (see §2.6 . 1 ). In this work both terms will be used, but for different senses: the
                                            language shall be referred to as I'saka, and the people and their village as Krisa.
                                                I'saka is unusual not only in terms of general world typology, but also in terms of the
                                            characteristics we might expect from a language of New Guinea, indeed even of the Macro­
                                            Skou family in which it finds its nearest cousins. Using the characteristics of a 'typical'
                                            Papuan language that Foley ( 1 998) proposes, we find that I'saka can be accommodated into
                                            the phonological expectations for Papuan languages, but that is only because the prospect of
                                            complete allophony between voiced stops and voiced nasals was not considered by Foley (see
                                            §2.4. 1 for discussion). Asmat (Voorhoeve 1 9 65) also shows complementary and free
                                            distribution between oral stops and nasal stops; Clouse and Clouse ( 1 993) describe just such a
                                            situation in languages of the Lakes Plains of West Papua. The latter languages are much                                                                                                                                                   1

2     Chapter 1more likely candidates for genetic relatedness to I'saka than is Asmat or any of its relatives.
Morphologically, I'saka shows more similarities with the Melanesian Austronesian pattern
than the 'typical' Papuan pattern (that is, the highlands Trans New Guinea pattern that is
usually evoked when referring to Papuan languages), with strict word order, no case-marking
particles, and relatively simple morphology. Syntactically, I'saka is mainly right-headed at
the clause level, but left-headed within the NP, as is to be expected (Dryer 1 98 8). The
language makes extensive use of light verbs (§5.3 . 1 , 5 . 3 .2), sometimes with a semantically
specifying nominal, and sometimes without, relying on either discourse-contextual knowledge
or on shared cultural knowledge concerning the activities performed with different things to
resolve ambiguities. These points will all be examined in detail from Chapter 2 on, following
a discussion of the sociolinguistic factors that are at play in the Krisa community.","[16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"
"
4. 1. 1 Unmarked pronouns
   The unmarked pronoun is the most common and flexible form of the pronoun, appearing
in a wider range of contexts than any of the other pronominal sets. The referent can be a
subject or dative referent, and at times the unmarked set of pronouns is even used as
possessive pronouns. Additionally, an overtly marked oblique pronoun must be drawn from
the unmarked set (such as accompanying participants, which are marked with tro attached to
a pronoun from the unmarked set, as in (95) in §5 . 1 .2). The only restriction on the function
of this pronominal set is that it may not be used to mark a referent which is the object of a
bivalent clause.
   It is not yet well understood what motivates the choice of the unmarked pronominal forms
when a more highly specified, and equally suitable pronominal set is available for the
function required, such as the nominative pronouns for subjects or the possessive pronouns
for objects.
   Examples of the use of the unmarked pronouns in different syntactic contexts appear in
the sentences below.
           Unmarked pronoun as subject of a bivalent clause:
   (62)    Nana tra              n-ou.
           1 SG     sago.delight l SG-eat
           'I ate sago delight.'
           Unmarked pronoun as dative referent:
   (63)    Buk n-ani-ma            mama .
           book l SG-give-2SG.DAT 2SG
           'I gave you the book. '
           Unmarked pronoun a s possessor:
   (64)    �p Nai nana ] b-asa-ke.
              boy l SG      2sG-carry-3sG.M.H.OBJ
           'You carried my child. '
           Unmarked pronoun as un-indexed oblique:
   (65)    Kapu k-ele '       umu.
           3SG.M 3SG.M-go 3SG.NM
           'He went to her.'
           (The meaning encoded in this sentence would be more commonly
           expressed with a dative suffix on the verb: Kapu k-ele-ung 'He went to
           her', Kepu k-au-na 'He came to me'.)
48      Chapter 4   From the wide range of functions in which the unmarked set of pronouns appears it is
clear that they are not specified for grammatical features other than the pronominal ones that
they exist to mark.","[65, 66]"
"
5. 1.2 Accompaniment and location
   The case markers sa and tro appear on some oblique noun phrases to more closely specify
the meaning than simply general oblique, which is implied by the NP appearing in a
postverbal position. Sa is used to show accompaniment, and tro can be used with this
function, or to indicate a specifically interior location (within). The former, sa, is used only
infrequently, and not accepted by some speakers; for those that do use it, sa appears at the
start of the NP, not final. Tro is often omitted from speech, with the simple locative coding
sufficing for its sense.
   Examples of these case markers can be seen in the following phrases:
   (9 1 )   K-ele '-le'    sa        Dominic.
            3SG.M-gO-RED ACCOM Dominic
            'He went with Dominic. '
   (92)     Bala     d-ele'-le '   Pasi Robert-tro.
            tomorrow 1 SG-gO-RED Pasi Robert-ACCOM
            'Tomorrow I 'm going to Pasi with Robert. '
56     Chapter 5  Note that the order of the accompanier and the goal is not fixed, as can be seen by
comparing the last sentence with the following:
     (93)     D-ele '-le '   Simon-tro      Awakali.
              l SG-gO-RED Simon-ACCOM Vanimo
              'I 'm going to go to Vanimo with Simon.'
   We can see in these examples that the postverbal accompaniment NP does not contribute
to the set of pronominal features that are marked on the verb: in (93) the verb is marked for
a singular subject, and indeed plural marking is ungrammatical in this case. I f the
accompanier is presented in the subject position with the affix -sing, from sie 'two', then the
verb takes dual marking, as in:
     (94)     Bala     Simon-sing        s-ele '-le'       Pasi.
              tomorrow Simon-DU.ACCOM I DU-go-RED Pasi
              'Tomorrow Simon and 1 are going to Pasi. ' l
  Another use of tro i s almost instrumental in function, though i t i s less of a n 'intermediary
agent' than a -ri marked instrument. An example of this use is:
     (95)     Ubuei        tey       omu-tro            we owai.
              poison.root milk/sap 3SG.NM-ACCOM fish 3 PL.die
              'Fish die because of the sap of the poisonous vine. '
              (The regular form of the 3SG.NM pronoun is umu (see §4. 1 ); the lowered
              initial vowel here might be due to the presence of the low vowel in the
              suffix - tro , or it might be a dissimilatory effect brought on by the
              preceding high glide in tey.)
   Here we can see that a non-agentive effector is marked not as an A, but as an oblique
cause, while the patient is marked as the S of the clause.
   It is also worth noting the identity in form between the accompaniment marker tro and the
locational noun tro 'inside'. Similar syncretism between duwe ' 'ground', 'outside' can also be
found (see § l O. l ).","[73, 74]"
"
5.2.3 Object inflection
   Independent bivalent verbs can be divided into two morphologically distinct classes. The
first class, a minority pattern, marks the gender and number (singular/dual being relevantly
grouped together as non-plural, NPL, opposed to plural, PL) of the object on the verb. This
may be accomplished in one of two ways: either through the use of suppletive verb-forms, or
through the use of more delimitable affixation - 'delimitable' in the sense that the
correspondences of pronominal values to the segments employed for their encoding match
the paradigms seen elsewhere. (In fact, calling this 'affixation' may be jumping the gun as
there are too few examples known to be sure that we are really dealing with regular affixes
that mean 'masculine non-plural object', etc., as opposed to patterns of lexical suppletion.)
Table 26 shows two examples of the class of verbs that mark some value of the object by
suppletive verb forms; the examples given here have been inflected for first person singular
subject (d-) as well as the inflection for object. The first example, with the verb -ai 'get' ,
shows what may b e analysable a s object affixes. The rightmost column illustrates the
patterns found with the verb -ei 'do', and shows object-governed suppletion, or at best object
                                                                                 Morphology   61affixation and major morphophonological changes. Although the prevalence of suppletive
forms makes it difficult to posit a root for the verb 'do', the third person non-masculine
object form -ei is considered to be the most unmarked, in terms of its range of application,
frequency of occurrence, and appearance in elicitation. As such, it has been treated as the
underlying form throughout.
                                     Table 26: Object prefixes                     SUBJ      OBJ            'take, get', [-aj]   'do', [-ej]
                      l SG     3NPL.NM           d-ai               d-ei
                               3NPL.M            d-akai             d-o
                               3PL               d-alai             d-ou   If the verb 'take' in the table above illustrates a productive (or at least regular, and not
entirely suppletive) object marking pattern, then the morphemes used to index the values of
                                                                                              ,
the object are prefixal to the verb root; the morphological structure of 'I take (masculine)
would most logically be PrefsuBJ-PrefoBJ-V, as in the following segmented example.
   ( 1 07)   d-ak-ai
             l SG-3SG.NPL.M-take
                                 ,
             'I take (masculine)
   Here the use of the k consonant in the prefix is reminiscent of the appearance of this
consonant in various places in paradigms involving third person singular masculine
arguments. We would posit the prefixes ak- and al-, the only consonant-final morphemes in
the language. With 'do', however, it is hard to isolate a single element that can be said to be
added to an otherwise basically invariant verb root. It could well be the case that prefixes of
the form V- and VG- are added and the rhyme of the prefix overwrites that of the verb root,
in a process similar to that described for vowel coalescence when subject prefixes of the
shape CV - are added to verbs (§5 .2.2). If this is the case, the prefixes are 0- '3NPL.M .OBJ'
and ou- 'PL.OBJ' (/'Jw/). An example of the verb 'do' inflected for non-plural masculine
object is given in:
   ( 1 08)   [d'J]
             /d-'J-Ej!
             l SG.sUBJ-3SG.NPL.M.OBJ-do
             'I do (masculine).'
             (See §5.2.2 for a discussion of the process of rhyme replacement in verbs
             following the syllabification of extrametrical elements, arguing that rather
             than simply vowel replacement, there is a more complex process involved.)
   For ease of glossing, only the features 'plural ' and 'masculine' will be indicated in the
gloss lines, as these seem to represent elements that, historically at least, were added to the
roots. Thus, d-ei will be glossed simply as l sG-do, not l SG-do.NPL.NM ; d-o will be glossed
as l sG-do.M, and d-ou as l sG-do.pL. The features non-singular and non-masculine will not
be explicitly marked in the glosses, as they represent the unmarked categories.
   In addition to these verbs with irregular (in the sense of less easily segmentable) means of
marking object values on the verb, a small and semantically distinct subset of this class takes
a regular set of suffixes that indicate number, person and gender of a human object (H .OBJ).
62       Chapter 5Those forms that are known are shown in Table 27, followed by some examples. It should
be noted that the human object suffixes bear the same 'signature' person/gender phonemes
(/dI: 1 sG, fb/: 2sG, 1kI: 3 SG.M and /w/: 3SG.NM) as the subject prefixes. These onsets tend not
to lenite intervocalically, implying that there are different degrees of morpheme juncture
involved here, possibly involving c1iticisation, compared to the lenition that occurs when
subject prefixes are reduplicated (support, albeit circumstantial, for this position is the
ambiguity of the position of the dative suffixes when in proximity to the completive marker
- see §S.7. 1 ).
                                   Table 27: Human object suffixes                                            SG           DU           PL                                1          -de           -si          ?

                                3 .NM      -wi   Examples of the use of these suffixes can be found in the following sentences; these
represent examples from both of the only two verbs that have been consistently observed to
occur with this set of object markers.
     ( 1 09)    M-opa-wi.
                2sG-carry.on.shoulder-3sG.NM .H.OBJ
                'You carried her on your shoulders. '
     ( 1 1 0)   Nai d-esi            d-epa-ki       yang-yang. 2
                boy l SG-carry l SG-put-3sG.M.H.OBJ leg-leg
                'I 'll hold the boy on my lap. '
     All observed occurrences of the human object suffixes are on verbs of carrying and
holding, such as shown with -opa 'carry on shoulder' and -epa 'place (on lap)' in sentences
( 1 09) and ( 1 1 0), and also (not exemplified here) -aisuso 'carry on side, carry on hip' and the
more generic -asa 'carry'. The use of the appropriate object suffix is obligatory in those
constructions exemplified above, and has not been observed, or accepted, with any other
verbs. We might reasonably assume that any bivalent verb that could satisfy the semantic
criteria (which we might define as 'envelopment of an animate (human?) object') would also
combine with the suffixes, but no verbs other than those listed here have been recorded with
the object suffixes. The fact that another verb of carrying, -asei 'carry by attaching to a pole
on shoulder', does not allow for object suffixes implies that the envelopment part of the
semantics is important.
     A few examples have been noted of 'carrying' verbs being used in an alternative
construction, in series with the verb -ei 'do', as in example ( 1 1 1 ) below. In this instance, the
human object suffix is omitted. The use of an accusative object-referencing pronoun, such as
die, is, however, obligatory.","[78, 79, 80]"
"
5.5 Functions of pronouns
   As described in §4. 1 , there are four pronoun sets in I'saka, with the maximum number of
distinctions found on the singular pronouns. Their morphological structure has been
presented in that section, and in this section we shall summarise their uses.
78       Chapter 55.5. 1    Personal pronouns
   We can note that the accusative pronouns bear a close resemblance to the human object
suffixes shown in Table 27 (§5 .2. 3). However, unlike the suffixes, the accusative pronoun
always precedes the verb. The recurrence of the sequence -pu in the nominative set is
interesting, as this possible morpheme/formative is exemplified in the data in other contexts
(most regularly, adverbs are also usually formed with -pu). Its putative independent meaning
appears to be something like 'emphatic ' or 'means of action '. This can be seen in the
following example, in which the appearance of the -pu seems to imply a strong causal link
between the two clauses:
     ( 1 90)   Bala         pz     k-ei       m6u-pu               d-ele '-le ' pili.
               tomorrow rain 3S0.M-do not.exist-EMPH? I S0-gO-<IRR> garden
               'If there's no rain tomorrow, then I 'll go to the garden. '
   Other support for the argument that this i s a (fossilised) morpheme is the fact that the
intervocalic /p/ is not prone to lenition - see §2 . 3 . 1 . The nominative form of the pronoun
is restricted to referents serving as the subject of the verbal clause, either bivalent or
monovalent, or the subject of a non-verbal clause. Some examples are:
     (191)     Depu       tei d-akai.
               I S0.NOM wood I so-cut
               'I cut wood.'
     (1 92)    Kepu          k-ele '  Awakali.
               3S0.M.NOM 3S0.M-go Vanimo
               'He's gone to Vanimo.'
   The unmarked form is the most common and flexible form of the pronoun, as it can have
a subject or dative referent, and may at times even be used as a possessive pronoun. It is
absolutely restricted only in that it may not appear as the object of a clause; this is always
reserved for the accusative pronominal set. Compare the sentence above with the following
nearly identical version using an unmarked pronoun:
     ( 1 93)   Kia     k-ele '   Awakali.
               3S0.M 3S0.M-go Vanimo
               'He's gone to Vanimo.'
   It is not well understood what motivates the choice of the unmarked form over the
nominative and possessive pronouns (or vice versa). Other examples of the unmarked
pronouns can be seen below, and in §4. 1 . 1 .
               Subject of verbal clause:
     ( 1 94)   Nana tra              n-ou.
               1 so     sago.delight 1 SO-eat
               'I ate sago delight.'
               Dative recipient:
     ( 1 95)   Buk n-ani-ma            mama.
               book I s0-give-2S0.DAT 2so
               'I gave you the book. '
                                                                            Morphology       79             Possessor in NP:
   ( 1 96)   Nai nana b-asa-ke.
             boy l SG      2SG-carry-3sG.M.H.OBJ
             'You carried my child.'
   The accusative pronouns are restricted to pronominal arguments serving as the object of a
bivalent clause; this is the only morphosyntactic environment in which they may appear, and
so they are the most restricted of the pronoun sets:
   ( 1 97)   Pi      bi        k-ang.
             rain.M 2SG.ACC 3SG.M-make.wet
             'The rain wets you. '
   A s mentioned above, the unmarked personal pronouns are able to carry a n inflection for
accompaniment, -sa :
   ( 1 98)   K -ele I  nana-sa.
             3SG.M-go l SG-ACCOM
             'He went with me. '
   This cannot occur with pronouns other than the unmarked pronoun set, though it is
grammatical with common and proper nouns (see §S . 1 .2):
   ( 1 99)   *depu-sa,             *die-sa
              l SG.NOM-ACCOM        1 SG .ACC-ACCOM
    Like proper names, the unmarked personal pronouns may also occasionally combine with
their corresponding dative suffixes. This creates yet another alternative possessive pronoun.
It is not known what motivates a speaker's choice of the nominative pronoun + dative suffix
combination over the possessive pronouns illustrated in Tables 20 and 2 1 .","[95, 96, 97]"
"
6.7 Verbs and the postposition tro   Coordinate clauses with the same subject in both may be linked using the postposition tro,
already encountered in §5. 1 .2, as shown in:
   (295)    Nana d-ele ' wang d-ei       tro.
            1 SG    1 SG-go song l SG-do with
            'I walked and sang. '
   In these cases the identity of the subject must be total. Note that sentence (296) is not
permissible even though the subject of the conjoined verb ( l SG) is included in the subject of
the first clause ( 1 DU):
   (296)    *si-Ie   wang d-ei      tro
             1 Du-go song l SG-do with
             'We two walked and I sang.'
   When the subjects of the two clauses are different, they cannot be linked with tro, even if
there is a logical connection between the two:
   (297)    *nana su       n-ou     wei     b-ei   tro
             1 SG    sago 1 SG-eat language 2SG-do with
             'I ate sago and you talked.'
   (298)    *nana sit     n-omo     m-ou       tro
             1 SG sago 1 SG-cook 2SG-eat with
             'I cooked sago and you ate (it).'
   Instead, no overt linker is used:
   (299)    Nana su      n-omo,      m-ou.
            1 SG    sago 1 SG-cook 2SG-eat
            'I cooked sago and you ate (it). '
   We can see from these sentences that the use of the postposition tro serves a switch­
reference function, monitoring the identity of subject (S, A) in the two clauses.
98      Chapter 66.8 Relative clauses
   Relative clauses follow the noun that they modify, and take the form of a clause with the
head noun missing. There is no special marker of relativisation. Two examples of relative
clauses in which the head of the relative clause is the object in that clause are shown below:
     (300)     Bala      sit      [b-akai]    n-o-nou.
               tomorrow sago [2SG-cut] I SG-eat-<IRR>
               'Tomorrow I 'll eat the sago that you're making. '
     (30 1 )   Sit       [nana d-akai] amo m-ou ?
               sago.NM [ l sG I sG-cut] who QSG-eat
               'Who ate the sago that I prepared?
   The following example shows that the theme object of the verb may head the relative
clause even when a dative argument is explicitly present on the verb:
     (302)     Pa [n-ani-ka]                  nuo ml.
               bag [ l sG-give-3sG.M.DAT] big NEG
               'The bag I gave him wasn't big. '
                (this sentence, with a different intonation, is also grammatical with the
               reading 'I didn't give him a big bag.')
   In this example the adjective nuo is licensed to appear following the relative clause
because it is not part of the NP headed by pa , but rather is the predicate of the clause.
7            Texts
   The following texts are presented as examples of I'saka discourse in miniature.","[115, 116, 117]"
"
6.6 Verb serialisation
    I ndependent verbs may be used in serial verb constructions, provided that they show
identical subject agreement, and the same specifications for polarity, aspect, etc. Serial verb
constructions are common constructions in the languages of New Guinea, and their use in
I'saka can be seen in the following example, which shows both manner-of-motion and simple
change-of-location verbs serialised together, each with their own inflection for subject,
necessarily agreeing (if there is overt agreement - the 3PL subject in (292) evokes no overt
agreement on the verbs because these verbs take no agreement prefix for 3PL).
     (29 1 )   A       nuo k-alie       k-ele ' ya.
               pig.M big 3SG.M-flee 3SG.M-go COMP
               'The big pig ran away. '
     (292)     Dakau onde akane w{ysau .
               children go hide forest
               'The children went and hid in the bush.'
   Note that this is an example in which the adjective (nuo 'big') appears adjacent to the noun
rather than after the verb, despite the fact that no peripheral argument is present. This may be
because of the presence of the completive particle, or because subject-linked adjectives
cannot follow serialised verbs. However, from (293) we can see that an object-linked
adjective may follow this sort of complex predicate. Note that in this sentence there is no
completive particle.
     (293)     Yung d-asa         d-ei kaipa.
               bird 1 SG-carry 1 SG-do one
               'I brought one bird.'
   Object suffixes (and presumably dative suffixes) need only be marked on the second verb,
as is shown in the verb series -esi 'carry' + -epa 'put' ('hold') in example ( 1 1 0), though this
may be a result of the first verb not being eligible to take the highly restricted object marking
(recall that only a small minority of verbs inflect for (non-dative) object in I'saka).
Restrictions on the compulsory sharing of irrealis inflection for serial verbs (that is, whether
one or both must be inflected) are not known.
                                                                                  Syntax       97   Some predicates appear to be expressed only by means of what is formally a serial
construction; these are described in §5.3 . l as dependent verbs.
   A maximum of two verbs in series has been attested, though logically complex events of
taking (carry, do, go) would be possible. Serial verb constructions of the type 'cause + result',
exemplified by the Tok Pisin Em i kilim man indai 'He hit the man dead' have not,
surprisingly, been noted in I 'saka, where the most commonly attested serial verb
constructions involve motion verbs serialising with either an elevational motion verb ('go up',
'go down') or a manner of motion verb ('walk ', 'run').
   (294)    Tani' dina       k-ele '     k-ung      wi'.
            father l SG.POSS 3SG.M-go 3SG.M-go.down sea
            'My father went down to the sea. '
   A range of other examples of verb serialisation can be found i n the texts i n Chapter 7.","[114, 115]"
"
3.1 Major word classes   Nouns and verbs are the two major word classes, being most obviously morphologically
distinct in that verbs show agreement and nouns do not, even when predicative. This can be
seen in the following pair of sentences, in which the verb -oung 'eat' appears with a prefix
that agrees with the subject of the clause, while tisa in (44), a noun, shows no such prefix,
nor other (more plausible) morphology which is the norm on verbs.
           Verbal predicate: agreement
   (43)    Depu        sit     n-ou-ma.
           I SG.NOM sago I SG-eat-2SG.DAT
           'I ate your sago. '
           Nominal predicate: no agreement
   (44)    Depu        tisa(*-na).
           I SG.NOM teacher(- l sG.DAT)
           'I 'm a teacher. '
   At least five further distinct classes can be distinguished. These include Adjectives,
Temporals, Deictics, Clause-relevant particles and Postpositions.
   The Adjective class (including quantifiers) displays elements of the morphological
characteristics of both nouns and verbs. Like verbs, adjectives may encode arguments with
the dative suffix. However, like nouns (and unlike verbs), they show no agreement for
person, number and gender of subject or object.",[56]

neighbouring Skou languages, it is a very distant one, in terms of structural diversity roughly
on the order of the differences and similarities that can found between Russian and English.
(Examples of some of the cognates that have led to the establishment of I'saka's position
within the Macro-Skou family can be found in §9.) The people in Krisa have an oral
tradition of having previously lived along a string of ridges that run south of their current
plateau home down to the Pual river valley, and before that further to the west in the valley
itself. It is likely that this tradition of previous occupancies accurately represents the history
of the Krisa people as they were forced into the more marginal hill areas when the Mbo and
Ningera people advanced down the Pual valley, displacing both the ancestors of the Krisa
people and the ancestors of the speakers of Skou-Serra-Piore linkage language (Donohue &
Crowther 2000; see also Donohue 2002a).","[25, 26]"
"
3.3 Verbs
    Verbs in I'saka are the most highly restricted word class in terms of their phonotactic
possibilities. This can be seen in the fact that all verbal roots are unexceptionally vowel­
initial, which functionally serves to accommodate the obligatory consonantal prefixation that
is found on all verbs (in both finite and non-finite constructions). This means that the
following possibilities are found for the segmental phonotactics on verb roots:
                                                                          Word classes     41                              Table 19: Phonotactic shape of verbs                       length         shape     example

                                      -VCVV     -alie       'flee'    Verbs can be maximally inflected for three referents (subject, object and dative) and for
one mood distinction through reduplication. I n addition to these compulsory inflectional
categories, several other verbal morphemes have been observed, mainly encoding aspectual
information, but these occur only rarely in normal speech and texts. They are described in
§5 . 3 .
    Examples o f verbs in use with the obligatory pronominal inflection are given in the
following sentences.
   (49)    Sit     n-ou     ya .
           sago I SG-eat COMP
           'I 've eaten the sago. '

   Issues i n verbal morphology and syntax are dealt with i n more detail i n many o f the
following sections.","[58, 59]"
"
5.3.2 Adjunct nominals
   Nouns also play a prominent role in building complex and explicit predicate semantics for
clauses which use the light verb -ei 'do' as their main inflecting verb. This is done in two
main ways: either through the use of a preverbal non-inflecting nominal specifier, for
example makaing in the complex predicate makaing d-ei 'I help' ; or through knowledge of
the nature of the main participants. For an example of this latter strategy, a clause consisting
of a human subject, an animate animal object, and the verb -ei 'do' will be interpreted as
'(Human) shoots/kills (animal)', based on the shared knowledge of the cultural world in
which I'saka speakers live. In a sentence with a human subject and a normally human-made
tool or artifact as the object, the verb -ei 'do' will be interpreted to mean 'make, process'.
72      Chapter 5   Some examples of other adjunct nominals that are frequently found, and the verbs that
they have been heard with, include (but are not restricted to):
        wang       'song'                            wang k-ei          'He sings. '
        sit        'sago'                            sit k-ei           'He processes sago.'
        dou        'hand'                            dou k-ei           'He claps. '
        susup      'grass'                           susup k-akai       'He cleans/cuts grass. ,t
        kasue      'cassowary'                       kasue k-ei         'He shoots a cassowary.'
        suwe       'laughter'                        suwe k-usue        'He laughs. '
       t This collocation requires the plural object form of the verb 'get', since cutting
          grass necessarily involves cutting more than just one blade - see §5 .2.3.
   Although this area of I'saka syntax has not been investigated in detail, it is easy to note the
ease with which independent nouns can be used with their culturally appropriate meaning,
and the ease with which Tok Pisin loans are incorporated into the language by means of this
construction, such as bal k-ei 'he plays with a ball', raitim k-ei 'he writes'Joto k-ei 'he takes
a photo', helpim k-ei 'he helps' (a synonym with the construction using native I'saka
morphemes makaing k-ei 'help(?) he-does'), we i k-ei 'he waits ' « Tok Pisin we tim;
synonymous k-akaing 'he waits', with the same morphosyntax, involving a dative-coded P),
or wari k-ei 'he worries'. For this last reading the native I'saka equivalent does not use an
adjunct nominal, but rather a purely nominal construction:
     ( 1 63)   Nana bou plai-na .
               l SG   throat bad- 1 SG.DAT
               'I'm worried. '
    The accusative case may, for some speakers, also be used here: #Die bou plaina, though
the apparently topic- like prominence of the l sG body-part possessor argument in this
construction makes this a less common strategy; this is in contrast to the common use of the
accusative pronouns in constructions with adjunct nominals (see, for instance ( 1 3 2), in which
the accusative pronouns are more normal, because the subject position in the clause is not
filled by the adjunct nominals ta l or nika nua.
    This sort of nominal construction, using modified body parts to predicate an emotional or
socially recognised condition, is found in other collocations as well without the dative
suffixes:
     ( 1 64)   Nana you              kaipa .
               1 SG     stomach one
               'I 'm cool about it. 'I 'I'm content. '/'I 'm not making a fuss over it. '
   The fact that the patently recent loans are fully incorporated into the morphosyntactic
system of I'saka, and are not (at least obvious) examples of code-switching, can be seen in
their occurrence with the full range of inflection, as in the following two examples, in which
the Tok Pisin nounsfoto 'photograph' and save 'knowledge' are used in I'saka sentences.
     ( 1 65)   Foto k-ei-ma.
               photo 3SG.M-do-2sG.DAT
               'He's taking a photo of you. '
                                                                            Morphology       73    ( 1 66) Save        d-ei  ml.
            knowledge l SG-do NEG
            'I don't know.'
    The productivity of this construction with loan words, and the non-compositional nature
of the semantics of the resulting complex verb, implies that it is a highly salient construction
in need of more investigation. It should not be thought that the number of Tok Pisin
borrowings in these constructions indicates that the language has a deficient or less rich
system of expression, or that it is currently undergoing massive relexification and/or
language shift. In addition to sentences like A d-o pig 1 SG-do, meaning 'I shot a pig', people
in Krisa also say A sutim d-o, with Tok Pisin sutim 'shoot' incorporated into the structure as
a semantically specific adjunct nominal. Even though there is a (clearly recent) explicit
coding strategy for 'shooting', the non-adjunct nominal construction with nothing more than
the light verb 'do' is also perfectly acceptable and normal, albeit (from a European linguistic
perspective) highly underspecified semantically. The cultural context (what do people do to
pigs?), given the discourse in which it occurs (what do people do to pigs, in the bush, when
they've taken their dog and bow and a handful of arrows?), make the various, linguistically
ambiguous, uses of the light verb perfectly communicative for I'saka speakers. A similar
strategy has been noted in populous Dravidian languages such as Tamil, using English words
as adjuncts to the light verb 'do', alongside native lexemes, with no evidence of language
shift or even necessarily diglossia operating.","[89, 90, 91]"
"
5.3.3 Verbs of location
   One further prominent class of verbs shall be mentioned. These are the verbs of location
of inanimate things, such as 'be at ', and they are illustrated below. The verb of the first
example, siakai, is commonly used for moveable objects, whereas ta in ( 1 68) and ( 1 69) is
usually used to describe the location of less mobile items.
   ( 1 67)   6   siakai ti'.
             pot be.at fire
             'The pot is on the fire.'
   ( 1 68)   Wei   dina        ta    Aliakaw.
             house l SG.POSS be.at Aliakau
             'My house is in Aliakau. '
   ( 1 69)   Tarie ta      yang mi.
             ear     be.at leg NEG
             '(Your) ear isn't located on (your) leg.'
   ( 1 70)   *nana siakai wei
              1 SG be.at house
             'I'm at home.'
   These words represent something of a conundrum for morphological analysis, as it is
impossible to tell with certainty whether or not they are inflected for subject. Inanimates
normally take 3SG.NM inflection on verbs, but the inflection for 3SG.NM on many verbs is
irregular (see §5 .2.2 and Chapter 8). The fact that these verbs of location begin with [t] and
74       Chapter 5[s] (which are probably etymologically related - see §2.3 .4) is suggestive of productive
inflection for 3SG.NM, at least historically. This is because a large proportion of verbs with
suppletive 3SG.NM forms are t-initial for 3SG.NM (e.g. tu 3SG.NM come).
    Occurrences of the verb siakai such as that in ( 1 67) do not show variation for number, as
is illustrated by the following sentence, which has a plural subject:
     (1 71)    Tei     amopa ni'           siaka lu      wei  tru.
               wood many INTENSE be.at be.at house inside
               'There's a lot of firewood inside the house. '
   Unlike inanimate things, animate subjects are 'located' using postural verbs that
incorporate information about the stance or orientation of the object, such as -ana 'sit', -ung
'be at', etc. (see below). Given this distinction in the verbs, the verbs exemplified above are
perhaps inherently inanimate, rendering subject inflection irrelevant.
   There are some instances of the dative suffix occurring on location verbs. In these cases it
encodes the possessor of the sole argument of the verb:
     ( 1 72)   Kap dina-e              sakai-na   wei.
               cup 1 SG.POSS-EMPH be.at- 1 SG.DAT house
               'My cup is in the (?my) house. '
     ( 1 73)   6 sakai-na.
               pot be.at- 1 SG.DAT
                'That's my pot.'
               (or possibly: 'My pot is there.')
   Examples of this can be found in the following paradigms and sentences, showing
different verbs being used with different nouns, depending on their relation to a human-style
stance or posture. The unmarked verb collocation used to indicate existing for humans, lada!
+ lui 'sit + be.at', inflects as follows (shown with the unmarked pronominal set):     ( 1 74)   nana n-ana n-u            nesing si-na su   numu ni-na ku
               mama m-ana m-u            lsang s-ana su    yumu yi-na ku
               kie k-ana k-ung           esang s-ana su    ia ina ku/ana ku
               omu (w)ona su
   It is not the case that different kinds of inanimate nouns are found with the postural verbs,
with the choice of verb acting as a covert classification system (as is seen commonly in other
Papuan languages, e.g. Enga: Lang 1 975). Rather, in I'saka, the postural verbs are used only
to show actual postural alignment for animate arguments that are capable of assuming
different postures, and inanimate arguments, rather than utilising these postural verbs as a
form of classification, simply employ a separate set of verbs. In a sense, then, there is a
classification of nomina Is into animate versus inanimate, but it does not go beyond this. The
one exception involves villages, which are coded as if they were animate, as the following
example shows:
     ( 1 75)   I 'saka        ana ku      i 'tanu.
               Krisa.village sit be.at mountain
               'Krisa village is on the mountain. '
  Here I'saka occurs not with siaka , the verb used to code a n inanimate argument's location.
Despite this ana is not inflected for person or number.
                                                                                 Morphology   755.4 Further verbal morphosyntax   The previous sections have presented the regular, mono-predicative morphosyntax of
verbs, with some complications in the use of dependent verbs. In this section we shall discuss
valency-affecting operations such as causation and various means of valency reduction.","[91, 92, 93]"
"
5.3. 1 Dependent verbs
   In addition to the independent verbs described above, there are a number of subject­
inflecting verbs that are not able to function alone in a clause without another verb.
Generally, they occur before an independent verb, agreeing with it in person, number and
gender of the shared subject. There are no recorded instances of dependent verbs taking
suffixes.
   Some dependent verbs carry adverbial information, like -asu in example ( 1 57), which
indicates whether the main verb is done well or badly:
     ( 1 57)   B-asu            b-o!
               2sG-do.well 2sG-do.sG.M.OBJ
               'Shoot it properly !'
               (In this example 'shoot' is taken as the meaning of - 0 from the context of
               the discourse, and is not related to the appearance of -asu. This sentence
               is a good example of the use of light verbs without any qualifying nominal
                - see §5 . 3 .2.)
   Some dependent verbs are used with an aspect-modifying function. Unlike the 'adverbial'
function of dependent verbs, in which they appear preceding the main predicating verb, the
dependent verb in an aspect-modifying function is positioned following the independent verb:
   ( 1 58)     Sokaing k-ei                k-ela-pu             mi.
               tobacco 3SG.M-do 3sG.M-do.habitually-? NEG
               'He doesn't smoke.'
               (It is likely that the final syllable pu of -elapu 'habit' is in fact the same
               fossilised morpheme that is found on many other adverbs, and on the
                nominative pronouns, as this syllable recurs word-final ly with notable
               frequency throughout the data. The meaning of it is not known - see
               §2.3 . 1 , §4. 1 and §5.5. 1 for discussion.)
                                                                                Morphology     71   Adverbial sorts of functions are also formed with adjectives, as in the following example:
   ( 1 59)    Bal b-ei     nuo!
              ball 2SG-do big
              '(Come on, you) play (soccer) with some vigour ! '
   In addition to this use of dependent verbs with a n independent verb to specify 'adverbial'
or 'aspectual ' functions, some dependent verbs provide the bulk of predicative semantics in a
clause through combining with and specifying the ubiquitous light verb -ei 'do', as in the
example below (in this example the suppletive verb form -ou, rather than the unmarked -ei, is
used because of the plural object) (see also the verb -imi in §5.4. 1 ).
   ( 1 60)    Kasue        n-akaing d-ou .
              cassowary 1 SG-search 1 SG-do.PL
              'I 'm going to look for cassowaries. '
              (Note that -akaing bears a more than chance resemblance t o the nominal
              nakaing 'eye', a semantically relevant item in searching. It does, however,
              regularly inflect as a verb: m-akaing b-ou 'you search for them'.)
   In the following example the verb -imgni 'be angry' does not occur monovalently without
the verb -ou 'do (plural object)':
   (1 6 1 )   Kia     k-imgni   k-ou.
              3SG.M 3SG.M-angry 3SG.M-do.PL
              'He's angry.'
   For the bivalent alternations of this verb, see §5.4.
   A logical subtype of the class of dependent verbs are those verbs that are only found
together: their status as verbs may be deduced from the fact that they both take subject
prefixes, but nonetheless they are only found in the fixed sequence. An example of this is
-aung -angye 'stretch (one's body)':
   ( 1 62)    Ta l n-au         n-aye.
              skin 1 SG-stretch 1 SG-stretch
              'I stretched. '
   The verb -ana - u 'sit', described in §5. 3 . 3 , is another example of such a predicate.","[88, 89]"
"
6.2 Involuntary state subjects   In many languages of New Guinea an involuntary state is usually coded with the
experiencer as the apparent object of the construction and the stimulus as a nominal (in
contrast to reference-dominated languages like English in which the experiencer is coded as
the subject of the event). In I'saka the construction most closely resembles the New Guinea
norm, but the experiencer, while appearing in accusative case (if it is pronominal) is marked
on the verb with dative suffixes. This might reflect the fact that dative suffixes are more
productive than is strict object marking on the verb, but may also reflect the semantic role
associated with the experiencer.
   The predicate 'sick', for instance, is expressed with a morphological non-subject. We can
call it a non-subject only because the morphology coding of the argument is not consistent:
based on the form of the pronoun we would think that I SG was an object, but based on the
fact that it is indexed by a dative suffix on the verb we are led to believe that it is an oblique.
   (267)    Di           wii-na.
            I SG.ACC 3SG.NM.do- l SG.DAT
            'I 'm sick.'
   A literal glossing of this sentence is impossible. The accusative pronoun, in preverbal
position, signals that 'I ' should be glossed as 'me': '(it) sickens me'. Despite this, the dative
suffixes following the verb imply that we are dealing with a possessor or beneficiary: '(it)
sickens forlon me'. We are thus in a dilemma about the grammatical function associated
with the first person singular participant in (267): the dative suffixes imply that it is an
oblique, and the accusative case implies that it is object.
   Other involuntary state sentences do not use dative suffixing:
92      Chapter 6     (268)     Pi      di       k-ang.
               rain.M l SG.ACC 3SG.M-wet
               'The rain soaked me. '
    In addition to sentences of the sort seen in (267) and (268) the experiencer may also
appear in a nominative case (or, as is true of almost all constructions, the unmarked case,
which for example (269) would mean coding the l sG pronoun as nana). This is found only
if the argument in question appears before a causing event, and if an experiencer argument is
called for by the construction. A nominative experience is illustrated in the following
example, where the predicate ('sick') subcategorises for an experiencer, causing the sickness
to be manifested in that experiencer.
     (269)     Depu         wii-na.
               l SG.NOM 3SG.NM.do- 1 SG.DAT
               'I 'm sick.'
   Other dative experiencers are described in §5 .2.4. The general construction that has both
a nominal and an inflecting verb as part of the predicate is also found in the adjunct nominal
construction, which has been described in §5.3.2.","[109, 110]"
"
3    An argument for treating postverbal nominals as truly oblique, and not simply obliquely coded core
     arguments (such as the datives of many European languages) is presented in §6. 1 .2.
64       Chapter 5                Recipient:

                (Note that a monovalent use of -anu 'call', with no goal, does not require
                a dative suffix, as in Yung kanu 'The bird cried out'.)

                'Who's coming to your house?'
                (Alternatively, this sentence might be better translated as 'Who's coming
                to you (at (your) house)?', in which case the dative would be construed as
                encoding a goal rather than a possessor.)
   Note that -ani 'give' does not invariably occur with the dative suffixes marking the
recipient. I n the following example the lack of dative suffixes on the verb was explained as
marking the fact that the speaker is requesting to have a flaming stick or a stick with glowing
coals passed to him, but does not want to get scorched: the use of dative suffixes on the verb
would imply that the fire more overtly affected the recipient, in this case adversely (by
burning the hand that accepted the fire).
     ( 1 1 9)   Til m-ani- 0 .
                fire 2sG-give
                'Give (me) some fire (to light a cigarette). '
   The following examples show that inanimate arguments are not encoded by means of the
dative suffixes, even when all the other conditions are met. The goal duwe 'dog' in ( 1 20) is
                                                                                       Morphology          65marked on the verb by the 3 SG.M form of the dative suffix, but the inanimate goal song
'coconut' in ( 1 2 1 ), with an identical semantic role on the same verb, cannot be marked, as
witnessed by the fact that the dative suffixes in ( 1 2 1 )' force a reading with a possessor.
    ( 1 20)      Mama yoko b-epe-ka               duwe.

                 'I threw a stone at the coconut. '
    ( 1 2 1 )'   *nana yoko depeung song
   This sentence is ungrammatical with the -ung referring to the non-masculine noun song
'coconut'. It is good for: 'I threw a stone at her coconut' or 'I threw her stone at the coconut',
with the -ung encoding the possessor of one of the non-subjects, and not the coconut itself;
the point is that the dative suffixes cannot be used to index an inanimate target.
   It is interesting that the P of the verb -elei 'see, look ' is not always encoded by the dative
suffix. I n relatively high-transitivity instances of the verb (e.g. 'watch' as opposed to 'see'),
the P is treated morphologically and syntactically as a normal object, and not as an argument
that may be encoded with the oblique-marking dative suffixes.4 In the following examples,
we see the patient-referent represented by a preverbal accusative pronoun ( 1 22), and as a
noun phrase occupying the preverbal object position ( 1 2 3). This contrasts with the post­
verbal placement of the low-affect P-referent pronoun mama in ( 1 1 5) above.
    ( 1 22)      Nana bi           d-elei.

                 bird 3SG.M-see
                 'I'm watching the bird. '
   Note that the postverbal positioning of the P of a potentially low-transitive verb such as
-elei 'see' requires that the (nominal) referent be indexed on the verb by dative suffixes as
well as appearing in this postverbal position. The ungrammaticality of a postverbal nominal
not being indexed with the dative suffixes is apparent from the following pair:
    ( 1 24)      *k-elei   yung
                 3SG.M-see bird
    ( 1 25)      K-elei-ka           yung.
                 3SG.M-see-3SG.M.DAT bird
                 'He saw the bird. '
   A similar contrast in transitivity can be observed with the collocation lainim k-ei 'teach'.
In the event of a successful instruction (the pupil learned properly, to everyone 's
4    The use of a dative-marking strategy on animate, and not inanimate, Ps is documented at length for
     languages of New Guinea in Foley (2000 : 374) and Whitehead ( 1 9 8 1 ). It is also attested in languages

pupil did not take to the instruction as well as the teachers would have wished, then the pupil
can be coded postverbally. The following examples were noted in spontaneous language
instruction from I'saka speakers. In the first example, the pupil did end up learning to make
an acceptable string bag, and so may be coded preverbally:
     ( 1 26)    Gertrude die         lainim wii.
                Gertrude 1 SG.ACC teach 3SG.NM .do
                'Gertrude taught me (to make string bags). '
   In this next example the pupil was not perceived as being so astute in learning, and so is
coded as dative. If an independent pronoun was present it would appear postverbally, and
could not be an accusative pronoun.
     ( 1 27)    Wei          lainim d-ei-ma.
                language teach 1 SG-do-2SG.DAT
                'I 've been trying to teach you to speak our language. '
   Note that the fact that there is an alternation between the postverbal, and datively indexed
nominal in ( 1 25) and the preverbal P in ( 1 23) does not mean that the postverbal nominal is
also a P of the sentence. The evidence against this analysis involves the possibilities for the
scope of a floated adjective, presented in §6. 1 .3 .
   The only occurrences of preverbal expressions referring to the argument that is indexed by
dative suffixes are found when the referent is an experiencer. Firstly, the experiencer of an
involuntary state verb may appear before the causing state:
     ( 1 28)    Depu        dakai  wii-na.
                1 SG.NOM sneeze.NM 3SG.NM.do- 1 SG.DAT
                'I sneezed. '
   I n this case the nominative case on the experiencer shows that it cannot be treated a s the
object of the verb. The accusative case is not possible here: if the experiencer appears before
the causing state, then it must be nominative or unmarked.
     ( 1 29)    *die dakai wiina
   Other involuntary state predicates appear with a body part as the preverbal nominal. In
these cases the dative suffixes are still possible, such as is found with wiy 'wet' :
     ( 1 30)    Ta ' wiy-na.
                skin wet- 1 SG.DAT
                'I'm wet. ' ('My skin is wet. '?)
   It is also grammatical to mark the possessor just with a possessive pronoun in the NP that
occurs preverbally; in these cases, a greater degree of affectedness is expressed than that in a
clause with dative suffixes on the predicate (note that the predicate in this clause is an
adjective, and not a verb, but the same is true for verbal clauses):
     (1 3 1 )   Ta ' dina          wiy.
                skin 1 SG .POSS wet
                'I'm really wet. '
   When a free pronoun i s used with this construction, i t appears i n the accusative case:
                                                                              Morphology        67   ( 1 32)    Die        ta l ma-na .
              l SG.ACC skin hot- 1 sG.DAT
              'I'm hot.'
   ( 1 3 3)   Die        nika nua Wll-na.
              l SG.ACC sweat big 3SG.NM.do- 1 SG.DAT
              'I'm really sweaty. '
   Another important use of the dative suffixes is to mark the experiential object of a verb
that has an adjunct nominal as part of the semantic coding strategy. For instance, 'wash
(someone)' is expressed, as in many languages of New Guinea, with a construction that
involves the nominal for 'water'. This appears in the immediately preverbal position, and the
washee is marked on the verb by means of dative suffixes:
   ( 1 34)    Nu Wl       d-ebuwe-ung.
              girl water l SG-wash-3SG.NM.DAT
              'I washed the girl.'
   With a pronominal argument as the washee, we find that the pronoun must appear in the
accusative case (or the unmarked - but not nominative):
   ( 1 3 5)   Bie        Wl    d-ebuwe-ma.
              2SG.ACC water l sG-wash-2SG.DAT
              'I washed you. '
    In this construction the accusative case on the washee clearly indicates that this argument
is the P of the clause, yet it is still coded on the verb by means of dative suffixes. This is also
the case for -aka 'scratch' and dakai wii- 'cough, be phlegmy, have snot':
   ( 1 36)    Ta I b-aka-ya-ung.
              skin 2sG-scratch-COMP-3sG.NM .DAT
              'You scratched her.'
   ( 1 37)    Depu dakai wii-na.
              l SG    cough 3SG.NM.do- 1 sG.DAT
              'I coughed. '
   Note that these predicates, unlike 'be hot' and 'be sweaty', do not allow the dative-indexed
experiencer to be in accusative case, or to follow the adjunct nominal:
   ( 1 38)    *die      dakai wii-na
               l SG.ACC cough 3SG.NM .do- 1 SG.DAT
   ( 1 39)    *dakai (nana/depu/die)         Wll-na
               cough l sG/1 SG.NOM/ 1 sG.ACC 3SG.NM .do- 1 sG.DAT
   Other predicates are not so clear: 'laugh' is expressed with an adjunct nominal suwe
'laughter' and the verb -usuwe 'laugh':
   ( 1 40)    Dapu        suwe  d-usuwe.
              l SG.NOM laughter l SG-Iaugh
              'I laughed. '
   When a P is added, it is indexed with dative suffixes and appears post-verbally; if
pronominal, it may not be accusative, nor may it be preverbal:
68       Chapter 5     (141)     Dapu       suwe     d-usuwe-ka         duwe.
               l SG.NOM laughter l SG-laugh-3sG.M.DAT dog
               'I laughed at the dog. '
     ( 1 42)   Dapu       suwe      d-usuwe-ka         kia.
               l SG.NOM laughter l sG-laugh- 3sG.M.DAT 3SG.M
               'I laughed at him. '
     ( 1 43)   *dapu     suwe     d-usuwe-ka            kie
                l SG.NOM laughter l SG-laugh-3sG.M .DAT 3SG.M.ACC
   Finally, some verbs, while not showing an adjunct nominal, do nonetheless index the P on
the verb with the dative suffixes. These are all verbs that can be thought of as displaying
some features of low-transitivity. In clauses with these verbs the P may appear preverbally
or postverbally, as with the P of a verb like -elei, but unlike those verbs the dative suffixes
are obligatory, regardless of the position of the nominal. A pronoun is accusative if it is
present, and must be preverbal. (Alternatively, of course, the pronoun may be unmarked for
case, which is always an option with arguments that may be expressed with the accusative
pronoun set. Importantly, the pronoun may not be expressly nominative.) The following two
sentences show that a nominal P of the clause may be either preverbal or postverbal.
     ( 1 44)   Dapu        manit dina        d-akaing-ung.
               l SG.NOM mother l SG.poss l sG-wait-3SG.NM .DAT
               'I 'm waiting for my mother.'
     ( 1 45)   Dapu d-akaing-ung manit dina.
   The following ungrammatical sentences are identical to ( 1 44) and ( 1 45) apart from the
lack of agreement on the verb for manit dina. These sentences show that the use of the dative
suffixes is obligatory with this verb:
     ( 1 46)   *dapu manit dina dakaing, *dapu dakaing manit dina
   When a pronoun is present, it must be preverbal and accusative or unmarked, and must be
indexed on the verb by means of the dative suffixes. The grammatical version is:
     ( 1 47)   Dapu        hi         d-akaing-ma .
               l SG.NOM 2SG.ACC l sG-wait-2sG.DAT
               'I 'm waiting for you.'
   The following ungrammatical 'near-misses ' corresponding to the sentence above show
that, firstly, the dative suffixes are obligatory for this verb; secondly, that the accusative
pronoun may not be postverbal, and thirdly that, even if not overtly accusative, a pronominal
P may not follow the verb.
     ( 1 48)   *dapu hi dakaing
     ( 1 49)   *dapu dakaingma hi
     ( 1 50)   *dapu dakaingma mama
   It should be clear from the preceding discussion that the many issues involved with the
dative suffixes in I'saka are far from being completely resolved, and that these affixes are
multifunctional in the sense that they appear to mark not only some oblique arguments on the
verb, but also the P of a variety of low-transitive clauses (providing, in effect, an oblique-
                                                                                  Morphology         69coding strategy similar to the conative in English). It should not be thought that all low­
transitive clauses mark their P by means of the dative suffixes, or even the postverbal
position. In the case of -ele ' 'go, follow' a goal appears postverbally, but without indexing on
the verb (see §4. 1 . 1 ). This is true for both goals, as in the example in §4. 1 . 1 , and for 'things
followed', as in the example below:
   (1 5 1 )   Dapu       d-ele ' pli-pa . . .
              1 SG.NOM 1 SG-go road-sEQ
              'I followed the road (and then . . . ). '
   The following clause is clearly (both from its internal semantics, and from a cross­
linguistic study) low in transitivity, yet does not employ either of these low-transitivity coding
options:
   ( 1 52)    Dapu        wi      d-akai.
              1 SG.NOM water l SG-cut
              'I crossed the river. '
    Some additional issues involving the positioning of the dative, and its status a s an affix or
clitic, are raised in §5 .7. 1 .","[81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87]"

6    Chapter 1   Anthropological interest has also focused on a 'millennia I ideology' that apparently
flourished in Krisa (as elsewhere in the world) as the year 2000 approached (see Kocher
Schmid & Klappa 1 999, and Klappa 1 999c). The relationship between these researchers and
the village is ongoing. Although the current material is focussed on linguistic data and not
anthropological theory, in the minds of the Krisa people it represents just the latest in a long
line of note-taking on essentially the same topic. In our experience it is usual that, in northern
New Guinea, any anthropological or linguistic work with a people group is usually described
by the subjects of that research as involving a researcher coming to 'learn the local language',
and any approved of and successful researcher will be described as having 'learnt the local
language well' .2 Clearly, language consciousness is the measure of cultural worth in this part
of the world.","[23, 24]"

which are also found in the verbal affixes to mark subject, object and dative. These are the
use of Idl for first person, fbi for second person, Ik/ for third person masculine, and Iwl or lui
for third person non-masculine. It is also worth noting that the accusative pronouns, marked
by a high vowel Iii and (in careful speech) lei, bear a close resemblance to the human object
suffixes (shown in Table 27), and probably reflect a close historical relationship. However,
unlike the object-marking suffixes, the accusative pronoun always precedes the verb, and is
not bound; the grammaticalisation pathway between the two forms is at best distant. There
are again striking resemblances between the accusative pronouns and the possessive ones,
which appear to consist of the reduced accusative plus the dative suffix (see §5.2.4). The
nominative set is marked by the recurrence of the final sequence pu, which shows intriguing
phonological similarities to the same sequence in other contexts (these include its appearance
as a common adverbial ending, suggesting a common sense of 'performance of an action' as
a component of the meaning of the [once-productive?] formative). Furthermore, the first
vowel of all the nominative pronouns varies between e and a : in addition to the forms listed
above, dapu, bapu, kapu and wopu (not *wapu , showing clear influence of the initial w) are
also heard for the nominative, from the same speakers that produce depu, etc . The same
applies to the last vowel of the accusative pronouns: in addition to being optionally omitted,
older speakers are known to use an a instead of e : dia, bia , kia , thus collapsing the
unmarkedlaccusative distinction for the 3 SG.M.
    As mentioned above, the unmarked personal pronouns can be marked for cases. They are
able to carry a case marker for accompaniment, sa , and function as adjuncts in clauses (see
§5 . 1 .2). Like proper names, the unmarked personal pronouns may also occasionally combine
with their corresponding dative suffixes. This creates another alternative possessive pronoun.

   The motivation behind a speaker's choice of the nominative pronoun + dative suffix
combination over the possessive pronouns is unclear, though it might be that the unmarked
pronoun + dative suffix strategy is more 'colloquial' or 'informal' than the use of the
                                                                   Pronominal forms         47dedicated possessive pronouns. More extensive and systematic checking of texts is needed to
confirm this hypothesis. Not enough data is available to draw any conclusions about the
discourse conditions that motivate one strategy over another, and speakers all report that the
unmarked pronoun + dative suffix strategy may replace a possessive pronoun in all contexts
queried.","[64, 65]"
"
5.2. 4 Argument inflection using the dative suffix
   A range of non subcategorised participants are marked on the verb using the dative suffix.
The fact that the nominal is peripheral can be judged by its appearance in a postverbal
position, a position reserved for oblique arguments. 3 Although there is a large range of
possible referents, with different and non-conflicting semantic roles, only one instance of the
dative suffix may appear in any one clause; the criteria for choosing which of the possible
referents of the dative suffix will be chosen in the event of two or more possible candidates
are not yet known, though it does seem that, while semantically not incompatible, it is
unlikely from a discourse point of view that two of the possible candidates for coding will
appear in the one clause.
   This suffix demands an animate referent, and can be used to encode recipient,
beneficiary, goal, experiencer and possessor (usually the possessor of the object of a bivalent
verb). The forms of the dative suffix are shown in Table 28, and some examples of its use
are reproduced below. Some forms are identical to the human object suffixes shown in
Table 27.",[81]
"
4. 1.5 Non-singular pronouns
   The case distinctions of the non-singular pronouns are less developed than the singular
pronouns, with not all distinctions found in the singular set being attested in the non-singular.
Particularly, there is not a distinct accusative form for the non-singular pronouns, with this
function most commonly being filled by pronouns from the unmarked set. Alternatively,
accusative pronouns from the singular set can be used for non-singular objects, indicating
that these pronouns are in fact not formally marked for number.
50     Chapter 4                            Table 2 1 : Non-singular personal pronouns                                Unmarked         Nominative     Possessive

                        3       le              epu             omokai   The dual pronouns are clearly related to formatives added to the putative formative si
'dual', transparently related to the contemporary word sie 'two'. In addition to the unmarked
dual pronouns above, there are other forms of the first and second person which are
composed of the singular pronominal forms (na l w and m a m a) and the dual formative,
yielding nanasi and mamasi. The unmarked forms of the first and second person plural
pronouns are also used as the possessive pronominals, as shown in Table 2 1 . As with the
singular pronouns, there is considerable alternation between a and e in some of the pronouns:
nasing/nesing, asang/esang, ia/ie, nasipu/nesipu, apu/epu.
   An example of a 'singular' accusative pronoun being used with plural reference is:
     (76)   /sang s-au-pa          dapu       hi        d-elei.
            2DU 2DU-come-SEQ l SG.NOM 2SG.ACC l SG-see
            'Y ou two came, and then I could see you. '
   The features associated with the different pronoun forms, both singular and nonsingular,
are shown in Table 20 (illustrated with the unmarked prominal set). Here we can see that the
dual pronouns are more marked in terms of pronominal features than any other pronouns.
This is because the singular pronouns are unspecified for any value for the feature
[nonsingular] or [dual] (which is dependent on nonsingularity); the singular pronouns assume
a default interpretation that they apply to singular elements since they are not as specified as
the other numbers (the same argument applies to the plural pronouns with respect to the
feature [dual]). The duals, on the other hand, have to be explicitly specified as being both
nonsingular and dual. This system of features captures the more marked character of the
dual pronouns, morphologically evidenced by the lack of distinctions in the bound
pronominal forms for duals: there are often no distinctions in the subject prefixes for the
dual persons, the object suffixes collapse 3DU with 3 PL, and the dative suffixes do not
distinguish second and third person. This system of features also predicts the unmarked
nature of the 'singular' pronouns, evidenced by the fact that the accusative pronouns, which
are composed of formatives found in the singular pronominal sets, can be used with both
singular and non singular reference. Finally, but more stipulatively, the system also captures
the fact that the feminine, rather than the masculine, is more common in the inanimate
world, and so is the category with less featural marking.

function, at its extreme with the unmarked pronouns occurring in almost all functions, the
verbal affixes are completely distinct. There is no variation in the use of verbal affixes in a
given morphosyntactic construction: given the construction, the choice of the bound
pronominal form is fixed. On the other hand a free pronoun, if used, can in many cases be
either of two possibilities, since the unmarked pronominal set overlaps functionally with the
nominative, accusative and possessive pronouns.","[67, 68, 69]"

4.2 Interrogative pronouns   In addition to the personal pronouns listed above, which are unique in l'saka in being a
non-bound word class that shows multiple distinctions for case, there is also a small set of
mainly non-human interrogative pronouns. Not all of these are single morphemes, with
'when' and 'where (location)' showing the instrumental suffix -ri in a lexicalised and
idiosyncratic usage. All the known interrogatives are listed in Table 24.

more discussion of this morpheme. Examples of the use of these different interrogatives are
given in the following sentences:

     (82)        Bepu      a b-(i)aka b-ou-na ?
                 2SG.NOM pig 2SG-why 2SG-do.pL.OBJ- I SG.DAT
                 'Why did you shoot my pigs?'
   These interrogative pronominals functions in content questions, and the pronouns referring
to A , S a nd P, appear in a special structural position, which is described in §6. 1 .
Interrogatives of possession ('whose?') are formed in a normal possessive construction with
the interrogative amo:
     (83) a. A amo bIe?
             pig who that
             'Whose pig is that?'
              b. A dina .

                '(It's) my pig. '

possessive function, as a predicate: Dina 'Mine'.
   Questioning locations is a fraught issue in I'saka. The examples above have shown
questions based around the position of an inanimate item ('Where is your house?'), or the
direction of travel ('Where are you going?'). It is not so easy to ask where a person is. A
typical question/answer sequence is one in (84):
   (84) a. Mama amo bu ?
           2SG     who woman
           'Where are you from?'
         b. Nana J 'saka bu.
            1 SG Krisa woman
            'I 'm a Krisa woman.'
   I t is easy to see that the question is literally asking 'Whose woman are you?' This
question, and the answer, shows the personification that is normal in I'saka when referring to
villages: 'I am Krisa's woman ' . An alternative way of questioning someone's origins,
something like 'You are a woman of where?', is not grammaticaL
   (84)' c. * mama     tari  bu ?
              2sG      where woman
   A similar example of the unexpected use of a construction involving amo 'who' in a
questioning situation arises when questioning someone's clan name. In this case the literal
translation of the sentence is 'Your clan's name is who?', as can be seen in (85).
  (85)      EM> Bulakau bima         INp ta l ia ] ] amo?
                clan     2SG.POSS        skin 3PL who
            'What's your clan name?'
   More examples of the personification of villages can be seen in the choice of locational
verbs, described in §5.3 . 3 .
5           Morphology
   Compared to many languages of New Guinea, the level of complexity encountered in the
morphology of I'saka is not great. Nonetheless, the divisions made in I'saka are intriguing
and cross-linguistically unusual, especially in the area of verbal affixation. In this section we
shall examine first the notional syntactic categories that can be applied to I'saka, on
language-internal morpho syntactic grounds (already discussed in Chapter 3), and then discuss
the morphology that is associated with each of those word classes.","[69, 70, 71, 72]"
"2     The verb is pronounced [d€paki], and not [d€payi], showing a lack of lenition of the /k/ of the object
      marker.

              (Note here also the use of second person singular prefixes, consistent with
              a command, despite the vocative use of a [necessarily third person]
              nominal sentence-initially.)
   It is not known what motivates a speaker's choice of one of these constructions over the
other. An alternative mode of inflection for object is found productively with verbs that take
an adjunct nominal, and use the dative suffixes to mark the affected experiential object.
   The second class of bivalent verbs, the vast majority of verbs in the lexicon, normally
shows no marking for object.","[80, 81]"

                                                                           Word classes      39            Adjective predicate: optional dative agreement, no subject agreement

   Adjectives are phonologically distinct from verbs in that they most commonly begin with
consonants, not vowels. This alone would account for the lack of subject agreement on these
words, but it does not explain the consistent correlation between consonant-initial non­
nominal stems and property, rather than action, semantics. Additionally, adjectives (and no
other word classes) may occur with a postposed intensifying particle nil, as in:
   (47)     SU      ei     nil.
            sago good INTENSE
            'It's very good sago. '
   A further support to the notion that there is a categorial distinction between verbs and
adjectives, and not just a phonological one, is the fact that one verb has been recorded that is
consonant-initial, wopukai 'trick, fool, muck up', which may be used monovalently or
bivalently, and if the latter may appear with dative suffixes marking the P.
   (48)     Depu       wopukai-ma!

"
5.2.2 Subject inflection   All verbs (both finite and non-finite) in I'saka inflect by prefix for subject, as can be seen
by the following mainly regular paradigms of the verbs -iy 'sleep' and -oung 'eat'. The
columns for each verb are, left to right, singular, dual and plural, with first, second, and third
person rows running down each column. The final row is the 3SG.NM form, distinguished
from the 3SG.M only in the singular.
     (101)     d-iy    s-i     di-(2)          n-ou        s-oung      nz-
               b-iy    s-iy    yi-(2)          m-ou        s-oung      yz-ng
               k-iy    s-iy    (2)-iy          k-oung      s-oung      (2)-oung
               wi                              w-oung
    Based on this data, and other verbal paradigms, we can infer the underlying prefixes that
are applied to the verbs. The abstracted forms of the prefixes are shown in Table 25 below,
in the same arrangement as the forms in ( 1 0 1 ). We can see that the prefixes encode person,
number, and (for third person singular) gender. Singular, dual and plural number are
distinguished, and in the third person singular form a distinction between masculine and non­
masculine gender of subject is marked. Third person singular non-masculine forms are
commonly irregular and suppletive, and this is also the case (to a lesser degree) with third
person plural subjects. Prefixes for indeterminate subjects - that is, the agreement found on
verbs for questioned subjects, as in 'Who's coming?' - are identical to those used for second
persons, of whatever number is appropriate (unmarkedly singular).",[76]
"   Temporals have scope over the whole clause, providing a time for events relative to the
utterance. Only three distinct temporals have been identified: kelie (or, sometimes, kelia)
'yesterday, before today' , buru 'today, now', and ba la 'tomorrow, later on '. Deictics
similarly exhibit three distinct forms, but the contrast encoded in the different forms is not a
simple one of spatial distance. The proximal and distal deictics are opposed in space, but the
third deictic has a discourse function rather than a spatial function. Three postpositions
(expressing location, accompaniment and instrumental) are also found.
   Five clause-final particles have been identified, and it is expected that others also exist.
These cover a range of semantic and grammatical functions. Their domain includes tense/
aspect/mood and negation; they have been grouped together on the basis of their common
position in, and scope over, the clause.
   Additionally there are several other particles and word-types that are only rarely found in
our data and are poorly understood. These remain unclassified on semantic or morphological
grounds, though they are listed in §3 .5.",[57]
"
3.2 Nouns
   Nouns are the most phonotactically varied of the word classes, with no restrictions on their
phonological shape (unlike verbs, see §3.3). Morphologically nouns are uninflected for
gender, number, or other categories, but are divided into two genders, masculine, M, and non­
masculine, NM . Gender is realised only through verbal morphology, in the choice of prefix,
40        Chapter 3suffix, or suppletive stem forms of verbs. The non-masculine gender is the unmarked form,
found with most animals, although some (e.g. pigs, the most culturally important and valued
animal) are masculine. Natural powers such as wind and rain are predominantly masculine,
with au 'moon' and (po)kisi 'night' being expected exceptions (this conforms to the cross­
linguistic data in Craig 1 986). Inanimate things such as plants and features of the landscape,
as well as household items, are almost exclusively non-masculine.
   I n addition to the pervasive, but morphologically unmarked in the NP, gender distinction
there is also a division between animate referents and inanimates. This is discussed in §5 .3.3,
where the choice of verb of location appears to be governed by pragmatic animacy factors.
There is evidence for some additional classing behaviour in I'saka, though it is no longer
productive, and shows no concord anywhere in the language. We can observe, however, a
more than chance series of phonological correspondences:
      •    nearly all birds show an initial [i] or [j] ;
      •    furry game animals show an initial [a];
      •    many hairless (and grammatical non-masculine) creatures, such as lizards and
           various water creatures, show an initial [u] or [w];
      •
           bandicoots tend to begin with [bi].
           (examples can be seen in the word lists in Chapter 1 0)
   While this has not been thoroughly checked, there does appear to be a strong tendency in
the Border languages Mnanki (and Man�m) for the names of birds to start with [i] or [j], and
for water creatures and game creatures to show an initial [a], and so on. This is also possibly
true in Fakmo (Bewani) as well, although in this language it is less striking (own fieldnotes,
2002-03).
   The question that might be raised is whether these represent cognate forms, or borrowed
forms, in the different languages. A superficial glance does not reveal many striking
cognates across the languages (barring this initial phone), and there are no morphological
similarities past this apparently classing phenomena. It seems that the idea of a 'shared
library' of biological terms in the Pual basin, proposed by Kocher Schmid ( 1 999) (see
§2 6 1 ), makes a lot of sense. The idea is that the culturally distinct groups in the Pual basin
  .   .
area, where the people of Krisa trace their origins even though they now live above that basin
on the Oenake plateau, have a common stock of labels for plants and animals, regardless of
their linguistic affiliation. These classing phenomena might be evidence for the antiquity of
that library, with the classes being retained in fossilised form even though the terms for the
individual species are often not cognate.","[57, 58]"

2. 6. 1 Segmental restrictions
   Syllables may be maximally composed of a consonant cluster, a vowel, and an additional
vowel or glide. Word-final syllables may be maximally composed of a consonant, vowel,
and a vowel or glide. Word-initial syllables of polysyllabic words and word-medial syllables
may be maximally composed of a consonant and a vowel. Syllable templates are shown
below.
      Monosyllabic:      (C(d» V(G)
      Polysyllabic:      [(C)V]2, (C)V, [(C)V(G)]
    The only consonant clusters permitted involve a non-velar obstruent combined with the
voiced dentoalveolar stop Id/, word-initially on oral monosyllables. The Idl is realised as [r]
following It!, and as [1] elsewhere. This rule of distribution has been observed productively in
loan words such as primus 'primus stove' , which is pronounced as [plaj mr s ] by older
speakers. Note that the name 'Krisa' is not a possible I'saka word; folk etymology has that it
is the name of the Patrol officer (Chris) who used to visit the village in the 1 950s. Older
speakers pronounce the word as [klisa]. Green River, a prominent town inland in the
province, is similarly pronounced as [klin] ([grin] in Tok Pisin), and Christine, the name of an
anthropologist well-respected in the area, has been heard as [k[l]rsina], showing the
preference for the lateral with non-alveolar consonants, and perhaps the introduction of a
new [kl] cluster into the language (assuming that these words are not code-switchings into a
local variety of Tok Pisin). Some examples of attested words with these shapes are shown in
(3 8), as well as some examples of ungrammatical potential clusters:
30     Chapter 2     (38)       Ibdel             Ipdajl    Isdawl       Itd:)1       *kC      *jC             *wC
                [ble]             [p IV ]   [slaw]       [tro]
                'this'            'bad'     'dry'        'with'
     We may capture these restrictions on clusters with the following three constraints.
     *GC                           The first principal is a trivial instantiation of the principles of
                                   following a pattern of increasing sonority in a syllable: a
                                   complex onset involving a glide, w or y, followed by any non­
                                   vowel segment would violate this principle of increasing
                                   sonority.
     *CC[-dentoalveolar]           The second principle is also a reflection of this hierarchy:
                                   conceivably the sequences Cb and Ck could occur, with the
                                   lenited allophones of b and k, [{3] and [y], appearing: [t13V] or
                                   [tyV] , for instance. In practice this is not allowed, probably a
                                   reflection of the relative closeness of the stop and the fricative
                                   in terms of sonority. [Cr] is allowed, as the sonority difference
                                   is relatively great, but [Cy] is not, because there is insufficient
                                   increase.
     *VCCV                         This principle barring a consonant cluster in a non-initial
                                   syllable is specific to I'saka, and does not follow from phonetic
                                   naturalness; it must simply be listed.
     *CCV(cr)*                     The principle barring a consonant cluster in a polysyllabic word
                                   is also specific to I 'saka.
     *C[+velar]C                   This final principle barring a velar stop as the first member of
                                   a cluster cannot be predicted from any universalist principles.
    The glides Iwl and Iji are permitted in coda position on monosyllables or word-finally (that
is, they may appear only at the right edge of a word). This means that an alternative
formulation of the permitted syllable structures for words in I'saka is that shown in Figure 8,
in which the word-final glide is structurally not part of a particular syllable but is an
extrametrical segment in the word.

                                   Figure 8: I'saka word and syllable structure
   Under this model the reduplication of verb roots would apply to the whole syllable and any
extrametrical segment associated with that syllable. The fact that these extra metrical glides
cannot be realised anywhere except word-finally, however, means that the glide has no
phonetic manifestation other than serving as a buffer to intervocalic lenition. The analysis of
the reduplication of dei 'I do' is shown in (39). Here we can see that reduplication applies to
                                                                                            Phonology   31the whole phonetic syllable, which can be of the allowed shape CVG (see Table 1 4). In the
reduplicated form, however, there is no position for the now medial glide to be realised; it
blocks intervocalic lenition, but is not structurally permitted at anything other than a word­
final position, and so is not realised on the word.

phonetic syllable reduplicated (as seen in §2.4.2). The fact that it is impossible for a glide to
be specified on the first syllable of a two (or more) -syllable word means that there is never a
conflict about the reduplication template, though interestingly this template applies to
phonetic syllables, including extrametrical material, and not to the underlyingly specified
syllable.
   Note that when a complex verb collocation is irrealis, it is only the second element that
undergoes reduplication. In (40) we can see that of the two-verb collocation -ana -ung (see
§5. 3 . 3) only the second verb is reduplicated:

32       Chapter 2   Very rarely, the segments [1] and [p] are found in coda position, and there is one instance
of a final [s] . The following examples are representative of such words (some additional
examples may be gathered from 1 0.2):
     (4 1 )    0::>1]       [bab::>l]         [k::>p]      [suzup]            [waws]
               'fence'      'sago grub'       'fence'      'grass'            'prawn'
     It is likely that these above examples are loan words: traditional farming methods amongst
the people of Krisa village do not employ fences, and so these terms are suitable candidates
for borrowing from a neighbouring language, such as Mbo, a Border language spoken in
nearby Osol, a village that has moved up from the Pual basin and, along with its fenced
gardens, is only a few hours walk away from Krisa. Kocher-Schmid ( 1 999) notes that plant
names are shared extensively throughout the Kilimeri cultural area, regardless of the
relatedness or unrelatedness of the languages in question, and so the chance of these terms
being originally loans from another language, perhaps brought in as alternants or as the
names of new varieties of the plant, and then generalised, is high. Unfortunately there is
little to no linguistic information available about these interior languages, so this cannot be
tested in detail.
    It is not entirely clear whether phonologically underlying glides (that is, segmental
phonemes) are permitted as word-medial syllable onsets, or whether their occurrence in this
position is a result of intervocalic epenthesis. For example, with a form such as [duw£] 'dog',
is the underlying form Idu£l, with an epenthetic glide, or Iduw£1? It is noticeable that some
intervocalic occurrences of the glide [w] consistently sound more like an onset than others.
For example, the glide in [duw£] 'dog' sounds more like a 'full' consonant than that of
[kasuW£] 'cassowary': it is perceptibly longer, is less likely to elide in fast speech, and more
likely to involve slight friction (though this is rare).","[47, 48, 49, 50]"

4. 1.3 Accusative pronouns
    The accusative pronouns are restricted to representing only referents which serve as the
object of a bivalent verb. The following sentences show examples of the use of the
accusative in a bivalent clause, and of its ungrammaticality when used to mark an oblique
(similarly, the accusative set may not be used to represent subjects, though this is not
illustrated here).
     (69)     Pi      bi        k-ang.
              rain.M 2SG.ACC 3SG.M-wet
              'The rain wets you. '
     (70)    *die      d-cLU-ma
              SG.ACC l SG-come-2SG
              'I came to you.'
   The non-plural possessive pronouns clearly show a relationship (presumed to be historical)
to their corresponding dative suffix (see Table 28), and to the accusative pronouns. For
instance, we could analyse the l SG.POSS pronoun as being the accusative form of the pronoun
combined with the dative suffix:
      This, of course, begs the question of identify ing a subject; the referent of an involuntary state predicate,
      which is index ed on the verb with dative suffix es, may also appear in nominative case. See §5.2.4, §6.2 .
                                                                     Pronominal forms         49   (7 1 )   di       +    -na
            l SG.ACC      - l SG.DAT
            'my'
   It is interesting to note that there is, synchronically, an alternation in the use of unmarked
pronouns with or without the dative suffixes to mark possession. No such alternation with
the accusative pronouns is found. The accusative pronouns are used in some emphatic
contexts, such as the following example (which also shows the initial b- of bima appearing
as an [m] because of the nasal syllables both preceding and following it in the clause).
   (72)     Di m-a        ni,      di    moni' [m]ima.
            l SG 2SG-mt PROHIB l SG mother 2SG.POSS
            'Don't hit me, I 'm your mother. '
   Oddly, the first and second person accusative pronouns can be used for reference to
singular or non-singular referents: di can just as well mean 'us' as 'me'. The third person
pronouns are not so free in their scope, and the other pronouns are all 'better behaved' in
terms of what they may refer to.","[66, 67]"

for the contour tones, Rise and Fall, and with punctuation (an apostrophe) for the H igh tone.
The phonologically unmarked Low tone is also unmarked orthographically. The necessity of
distinguishing graphically between H igh and Rise tones is arguable, as contrasts between
these tones are rare. This is an important question that should be addressed if further work is
done. The application of the tone-marking scheme is limited in that only lexical roots have
been marked; bound affixes are not marked for tone. Tone density is approximately 3 5%:
that is, approximately two-thirds of the syllables of lexical roots are unmarked by diacritics
for tone.
3           Word classes
   A discussion of the morphology and morpho syntax of I'saka, or any other language, must
be based on the knowledge of the different categories that make up the units to which
morphological or syntactic restrictions apply. In this section we shall detail the different
lexical categories that must be recognised in a description of I'saka, and present the
morphological and syntactic arguments for their differentiation. There are three open word
classes, and a number of closed lexical classes. After an overview, the major word classes
are described in the following sections, followed by a brief overview of the minor word
classes, including references to where a more detailed description of their properties has been
provided. The major closed word class, pronouns, receives further treatment in a unified
account with the bound pronominals in Chapter 4.","[55, 56]"
"
5.3 Other verbal morphology   In addition to the inflectional categories of subject, dative, occasional object, and the non­
concatenative process of reduplication for irrealis marking, there are a number of other
morphosyntactic categories that are marked on or with the verb, and they are discussed in this
section. I n all cases they involve more than simple affixation, and so have been treated
separately from those categories in the previous sections.",[88]
"
5. 7. 1 Completive
   The completive (COMP) particle ya indicates that the event denoted by the predicate of the
clause has been completed; it is usually found with active, dynamic predicates. Two
examples, showing both an active verbal predicate and a non-active adjectival predicate, can
be seen in the following two sentences.
   (2 1 0)    Sit    bima        n-ou-ma     ya .
              sago 2sG.POSS l SG-eat-2SG.DAT COMP
              'I ate your sago.'
   (2 1 1 )   Nit      dina       nuo ya .
              daughter l SG.POSS big COMP
              'My daughter's all grown up. '
    The following example, which has a beneficiary following the verb in the normal position
for nominals with such semantic roles, shows that this particle is not attached to the verb, but
is rather a piece of clause-final morphology.
   (2 1 2)    Tra             d-ei-ka               tani' ya.
              sago.delighLNM l sG-do- 3SG.M.DAT father COMP
              'I made the sago delight for my father. '
   Possible counters to this claim are found when the dative suffix i s used to mark the object
of the experiential construction (§3.4, §5 .2.4), and is not coreferent with the subject of the
clause. An example of a coreferential clause with no dative marking is shown in:
   (2 1 3)    Nana ta ' d-aka            ya.
              l SG     skin l SG-scratch COMP
              'I scratched myself. '
   (2 1 4)    *nana ta ' dakayana, *nana ta ' dakanaya
  When the two arguments are not coreferent, the dative suffix appears outside the
completive marker:
   (2 1 5)    Ta ' b-aka-ya-ung!                (phonetically [blla'j aw])
              skin 2SG-scratch-cOMP- 3SG.NM.DAT
              'Scratch her! '
   This placement raises some questions about the nature of the juncture between the verb,
the dative suffix, and the completive marker. From sentences such as (2 1 3) it is clear that
the completive marker must occur sentence finally. From the sentences in §5.2.4 we can see
that the dative suffixes occur final on the verb, but freely allow nominals to appear in the
same clause following them. Sentences such as (2 1 5) thus run counter to the prediction that
82      Chapter 5we would find the dative suffix final on the verb, followed by the (possibly enclitic)
completive particle. At this point we have no clear explanation for this discrepancy.","[99, 100]"
"
5 .4. 1 Causation and resulting states
   Causation is expressed in I'saka in one of several ways, depending partly on the lexical
valency of the verb, and partly on idiosyncratic factors. Additionally, where some verbs may
be used both monova1ently and bivalently, there can be restrictions on the aspect that is
grammatical with the monovalent use that specifies the resulting or prior state.
   We can identify the following relationships between monovalent and bivalent events
describing the same state but with the element of causation added:
   1.    the same verb is used for both senses, with no morphological modification;
   2.    a different verb is used; the monovalent verb may not be used with an object,
         and the bivalent verb may not be used without an object;
   3.    the verb from one category (bivalent or monovalent) may be used i n the other
         (monovalent or bivalent) with the addition of some (detransitivising or
         transiti vising) morphosyntax .
    We find, of these logical possibilities, that all three are realised in I 'saka. There are no
cases of verbs that take special transitivising or detransitivising morphology, such as
causatives or applicatives, or passives, but there are special detransitivising constructions
similar to the reciprocaL Examples of the two possibilities that are found are shown with the
verbs - u bu e and -epili, which have very similar semantics, showing that it is lexical
stipulation, rather than strict semantic classing, that determines the morphosyntax of the
construction.
              Verb is used with both two-place and one-place valencies:
   ( 1 76) a. Kapu            ubue-ka.
              3SG.M.NOM afraid-3sG.M.DAT
              'He's scared. '
             b . Kapu          ubue-ka               duwe.
                 3SG.M.NOM afraid-3sG.M.DAT dog
                 'He's afraid of dogs. '
                 (See also the behaviour of suwe . . . -usuwe 'laugh', which may be used
                 monovalently or bivalently, in examples ( 1 40-( 1 43).)
   Here we can see that -ubue can be used in either a monovalent or a bivalent clause; if
bivalent, the P follows the verb. Note that the S of the monovalent clause corresponds to the
A of the bivalent one. The dative suffixes on the verb agree with the experiencer, not the
instigator:
   ( 1 77)     Depu        ubue-na             (walpi).
               I SG.NOM afraid- l SG.DAT (crocodile)
               'I 'm afraid (of crocodiles). '
76      Chapter 5     Other examples of verbs of this class are -ala 'open', and -esie 'close':
     ( 1 78) a. Topu w-(u)la .
                door 3SG.NM-open
                'The door's open. '
           b . Topu d-ala.
               door 1 SG-open
               'I opened the door.'
                Verb is used only as an one-place predicate, and a different verb root
                is used when the clause is bivalent:
     ( 1 79) a. Nana d-epili.
                l SG    l SG-afraid
                'I'm afraid. '
           b. Walpi     w-uliwi-na                d-epili.
              crocodile 3SG.NM-frighten- l sG.DAT l SG-afraid
              'The crocodile scared me. '
   While having roughly the same semantic content as -ubue, -epili is a purely monovalent
predicate: there is no S:A correspondence. Similarly, -uliwi can only appear in a bivalent
predicate: in addition to the sentence above, Walpi wuliwina is also grammatical (though, on
the other hand, #Walpi wuliwina ubuena is somewhat odd). Another pattern of bivalency
can be seen in the following example. Other verbs with this behaviour include -asiy 'boil
(INTR)' and -angwi 'boil (TRANS)"" -oung 'fall ' and -alo 'drop (TRANS)'.
                Verb is used most basically as a two-place predicate, and requires a
                different construction when the clause is monovalent:
     ( 1 80) a. Depu       n-am         d-ou.
                l SG.NOM l SG-angry.at l SG-do.PL
                'I'm angry.'
           b. Dapu      dakau n-ani ya.
              l SG.NOM children l SG-angry.at COMP
              'I'm angry at the children. '
   We can see in this example that -ani 'be angry at' is a bivalent predicator, and that it may
not be used in a monovalent clause, with the same S:A correspondence that was seen with
-ubue, unless that clause is 'detransitivised' by the addition of the light verb 'do'. This is
similar to a possible reciprocal strategy (see §5 .4.2).","[93, 94]"
"
3.4 Adjectives
    As mentioned above, adjectives display some of the characteristics of both nouns and
verbs, but remain distinct from them morphosyntactically. A significant proportion of
adjectival roots appear to be morphologically complex, bearing a (historical?) suffix -pa that
is not observed on either nouns or verbs. The meaning of this morpheme is synchronically
opaque, and it appears to be a fossilised affix of some sort. Some examples include ino-pa
'far away', amo-pa 'many', asong-pa 'stealthy' and kai-pa 'one'; the putative roots of these
words, ino, a m o , a so and kai, are never found without the putative suffix -pa , so the
meaning of this putative suffix cannot be determined. The distantly related Skou language
(see § 1 .2, Figure 3) similarly has a disproportionate number of adjectives ending in the
inseparable putative suffix -fa : kukufa 'quick', hahafa 'slow', etc. This would be a likely
cognate with the I'saka -pa formative, suggesting that any productivity lies for the most part
in the distant past of the languages.
     Morphologically, adjectives (and no other word classes) may occur with a postposed
intensifying particle ni', as is shown in the examples below.
42       Chapter 3     (5 1 )   Sit   ei     nil.
              sago good INTENSE
              '(The) sago is really good. '
     (52)     Pi       k-ei         nuo nil.
              rain.M 3SG.M-do big INTENSE
              'It's raining really heavily. '
     (53)     *pi        k-ei         nil
               rain.M 3SG.M-do INTENSE
              'It's really raining. '
     (54)     Tei amopa nil             siaka lu            wei tru.
              wood many INTENSE be.at 3SG.NM.be.at house inside
              'There's a lot of firewood inside the house.'
    Adjectives may be combined with the dative suffix in experiential constructions, as
illustrated below. In these examples, the dative suffix encodes the experiencer.
     (55)     Yau       pali-ni.
              stomach hungry- I PL.DAT
              'We are hungry. '
     (56)     Ta l takau-ma ?
              skin hot-2sG.DAT
              'Is it (the fire) burning you?'
     (57)     Sit   takau-na       tuwo.
              sago hot- l sG.DAT mouth
              'The sago is burning my mouth. '
   It i s not clear whether the dative suffix i n this last example i s t o be interpreted a s referring
to the possessor, or the experiencer: 'Sago is hot in my mouth', or 'Sago is hot at me, in the
mouth'. The following examples are clearer, showing unambiguously that the postverbal
element serves as the initiator of the event, and that the dative suffixes mark the most
affected participant:
     (5 8)    Dapu           ubue-na.
              I SG.NOM afraid- I SG.DAT
              'I 'm scared. '
     (59)     Dapu        ubue-na            kasue.
              I SG.NOM afraid- I SG.DAT cassowary
              'I 'm afraid of cassowaries. '
  Notice that in these sentences the experiencer is indexed by the dative suffixes, but
appears in the clause in a nominative-cased pronoun.","[59, 60]"
"
1.3.3 Previous work on the language    The I'saka language has been referred to in the linguistic and anthropological literature as
 'Krisa', following the name of the village. Reference to the language in print is limited; only
Laycock ( 1 973, 1 97 5 ) mentions the language, where it is reported to have 347 speakers.
    The only previous linguistic work on I'saka is found in Laycock's 1 970 notes on 'Krisa'
and other languages of the East and West Sepik districts. While none of the linguistic data
from Krisa were ever to be published, the materials in his notebooks show that he was
definitely dealing with the same language as the one described here. Lexically there is no
difference between the speech variety that he has recorded and the one described here. He
noted ( 1 970:340) that the language was tonal, with pitch contours occasionally noted, and
four different patterns differentiated, roughly [-], [-], [I], and [\], probably reflecting the
same four tones that we have heard, low, high, rising and falling. (Curiously though, he later
(197 5 :8 5 1) wrote that 'Krisa and Rawo may have two tones only'. Rawo actually has five
contrastive tones.) (See §2.2. 1 for the tonology of I'saka.) In most cases where we have
found nasalisation, Laycock too has transcribed nasalisation on vowels, though occasionally
he shows more nasalisation than we have attested, with prenasalisation on following stops
that we have only rarely heard. An example of this is his sentence <nana ndau dey> 'Mi kam
slip' for our Nana d-au d-iy /da:da: d-aw d-ijl, [nana daw dgj] 'I'm coming to sleep. ' His data
shows the same set of verbal inflections (though he did not spot the allomorphy between the
oral and nasal stops). Laycock ( 1 97 5 :38 8) lists the verb inflections as being those shown
below in ( 1 ); these are completely compatible with the inflections that we shall see , discussed
in § 5 .2.2 and §8, and shown here as (1 )'.

   The intervocalic allophone of /d/, which we have heard as [1] is listed as both <1> and <r>
in Laycock 's notes. The alternation between [£] and [a] that we have observed in some
pronouns is evidenced in free nouns as well in Laycock's notes, where we can find <duwa>
for our duwe 'dog', and <siya?> for our sie 'two', and also in the 3PL inflection on verbs, as
can be seen in ( 1 ) above. The intervocalic allophone of /k/ that we transcribe as [V£V] ,

3.5.3 Pronouns
   The language distinguishes three numbers in its pronouns, as well as contrastive gender in
the third person singular (but nowhere else). Uniquely in the language, the pronouns are
marked for different cases, contrasting nominative, accusative, and possessive pronouns, as
well as an unmarked set of underspecified pronouns, and various bound forms that appear on
nouns, adjectives and verbs.
   Because of the complexities involved in the description of pronouns, concerning not just
morphology but also restrictions and requirements to do with their syntactic environments,
they are not described here, but in the next chapter.",[61]
"
3.5.2 Numerals
   The numerical system of I'saka is not complex, being limited to only three free forms,
corresponding perhaps to the three numbers (singular, dual and plural) that are found marked
on verbs or differentiated in the pronominal system. Numerals are distinguished from the
class of adjectives by their position in noun phrases (see §6. 1 .4).
   Numbers higher than three can be formed by combinations of the lower numbers, and it is
interesting to note that 'three' itself is often rendered as 'two plus one', rather than with the
use of the dedicated numeral for 'three'. The full set of recorded numerals may be seen in
the word list in § 1 0. 1 1.",[61]

2. 7. 1 Speakers' views on the graphic representation of tone
   No speaker of I'saka spontaneously expressed any prior awareness that their language was
tonal. Finding an appropriate vocabulary to discuss tone (in Tok Pisin) with Krisa people was
extremely challenging, and this was never wholly resolved. Speakers would certainly
innovate ways of describing the characteristics of the different tone melodies, but these were
rarely consistent. At this early stage, there was no set of Tok Pisin or I'saka words or phrases
that caught people's imagination to the extent that they could be satisfactorily mapped onto
the tone melodies (see also §2.2). This made discussion of the tone-marking scheme rather
difficult, but attempts were made to find out I'saka speakers' views on the matter.
   People we discussed the orthography with were generally supportive of the tone-marking
scheme, and some people (particularly the younger adults) were quite delighted with it. They
felt it was important for showing 'correct pronunciation', and took the challenge of writing
the tone-marks very seriously. It is possible, however, that they were simply agreeing with
the tone-marks because the orthographer seemed to think they were important, and because
they were novel and somewhat intriguing. Additionally, the presence of the tone-marks
supported the idea that I 'saka was special (since Tok Pisin and English do not use diacritics),
and that writing I'saka was something out of the ordinary.
                                                                            Phonology      35   Krisa people found i t more difficult to produce tone-marked text than zero-marked text,
as it necessitated an extra level of decision-making about how words should be spelt. At this
early stage, this tended to slow writers down, and placed a sometimes uncomfortable burden
on their encoding skills. However this did not deter people from trying. The correspondences
between phonological and orthographic representations are shown in Tables 1 6 and 1 7. The
vowel lal has been chosen for exemplification of the writing for no particular reason. Table
1 6 shows the interaction of segmental elements with nasalisation, and the orthographic
consequences of the addition of nasalisation to a syllable. In addition to these orthographic
principles that we have copied from the literature that has been produced for Krisa, we have,
in this grammar, written the sequence lijl as <iy>, to distinguish it from Iii!, and similarly
luwl is written as <uw> rather than <uu> (note that these syllables, like the other, few,
syllables with codas, are not found nasalised). This practice, writing <iy> and <uw>, is not
followed in the practical orthography.
36     Chapter 2     Table 1 7 shows the diacritics employed to mark the different pitch contours.
                      Table 17: Tone representation in the orthography                    Phonological         Pitch contour         Orthography

                        L                     [L]                   ta
                        R                     [ J! ]                ta
                        F                     [�]                   ta    We can see from Table 1 6 and 1 7 that the orthography favours phonemic over­
representation, as the 1 3 I'saka segments are represented by 1 7 distinct graphemes. The only
interaction between the two suprasegmental levels, tone and nasalisation, occurs when a
syllable is marked for both the high tone and nasalisation (with other than fbi or Id/ as the
onset). In this case logically either CV'ng or CVng' would be possible, but only the former is
approved. In practice, however, no instances of such a syllable have been found - all high­
tone nasal syllables occur with fbi or Id/ in the onset. This does appear to be an unusual case
of strong segmental restrictions on tonal association, involving the identity of the onset of the
syllable and the tone that attaches.
    Two segment-referent graphemes, <m> and <n>, (assigned to [m] and [n], allophones of
fbi and Id/ respectively) also represent the supra segmental feature of nasalisation. As voiced
stops are realised as nasals in a nasal syllable (see §2.2.2), the feature of nasalisation may be
encoded on the onset segment-referent grapheme, and does not need to be reiterated
elsewhere in the written word. For example, the word Idi/-N 'breast' ([niD is written <ni>.
This use of segmental graphemes to show both segmental and supra segmental information
(place from the segmental tier, and also the suprasegmental feature of nasality) is an example
of an 'integrated suprasegmental representation' (San Roque 200 1 : 1 0, 36).
    In several cases graphemes are assigned to allophones rather than phonemes. For example
the phoneme Idl has the distinct graphic representations <d>, <r> and <1> (as well as <n>,
described above), dependent on its allophonic realisation. This contrasts with the variants [p],
[f] and [4>], which share the single grapheme <p>. The main motivation for these different
strategies is compatibility with the phonic distinctions made in the Tok Pisin orthography.
This is not so much an abstract 'transfer concern' as an inevitable speaker preference.
    The phonic awareness of current I'saka speakers is largely derived from Tok Pisin. Being
aware of the 'separateness' of the sounds [d], [1], [r] and [n] through experience of the Tok
Pisin language and orthography, Krisa people were not satisfied with a single grapheme to
represent all four. (See Phillips 1 976:38-64, for a discussion of Tok Pisin influence on
phonic awareness with reference to the Wahgi language.)
    The only significant deviation from the Tok Pisin orthography is in the representation of
the suprasegmentals, nasalisation and tone, neither of which are present as contrastive
features in the Tok Pisin language. In the I'saka orthography, nasalisation on a syllable that
does not have a voiced onset (contrasting with the examples discussed above) is represented
by the digraph <ng> following the vowel, in common with the orthography of the Dumo
language, spoken on the adjacent coast to the west. For example, the word [pi'i] (younger
sister) is written <pung>. The sound correspondence of the digraph <ng> in I'saka is thus
distinct from those of the identically-formed digraphs in English, in which <ng> generally
represents the velar nasal [IJ], and sometimes the same nasal and a homorganic stop, and in
                                                                             Phonology      37Tok Pisin, in which the same grapheme, <ng>, represents the cluster [IJg] intervocalically and
the velar nasal [IJ] in coda position.","[52, 53, 54, 55]"
