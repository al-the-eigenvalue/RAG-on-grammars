Why is Bora so interesting?
The Bora phonology is rich in nonsegmental phenomena. There is an elab-
orate tone system, intimately tied to both the lexicon and the grammar.
(An entire chapter is dedicated to tone, and it is discussed in virtually
every chapter.) Various phenomena are sensitive to syllable weight, and
perhaps conditioned by foot structure.
   Morphologically, Bora is fairly agglutinative. There are many suffixes
and few— if any— prefixes. Many apparent prefixes are proclitics.
    Typologically, Bora is an OV language. Evidence for this claim is as
follows:
1. Both Subject-Object-Verb and Object-Subject-Verb are common
   word orders. Predicate complement clauses generally have Comple-
   ment-Subject-Verb order.
2. There are postpositions, e.g., in the locative construction, but no prepo-
   sitions.
3. In the genitive construction the possessor precedes the possessed.
4. Adjectives may precede the nouns they modify but it is more common
   for the modifier to follow the head in an appositive phrase. (This is a
   consequence o f the role played by the classifiers in forming referring
   expressions.)
5. Auxiliary verbs follow the semantically main verb (which is structurally
   subordinate to the auxiliary verb); see, for example, section 4.3.6.
    Bora has a strong case system implemented by suffixes. There is an
interesting animacy-controlled inversion o f the direct object and recipient
(goal).
     Perhaps the most outstanding feature of Bora grammar is the presence
o f a large number of classifiers and the various ways they are exploited in
carrying out reference. Strikingly, apposition— not constituency— is the
primary “ glue” for creating referring expressions.
   In forming discourses, Bora has a remarkable system o f sentential con­
nectives, one that exploits the classifiers to provide great intersentential
cohesion.",[27]

The grammatical relations o f causatives are further discussed in section
10.3.3.
   Adding -mei ‘reflexive or passive’ after -teho ‘causative’ yields only the
passive interpretation in which the subject (o f the whole) is the causative
agent (the one who caused the action):(256) Indhbedfvu méénutsamenbye.

      ‘He* provoked his* brothers to beat him* up.’ (lit.            ‘He* allowed
      himselfj to be beaten up by his* brothers.’)If we assume that (1) when a transitive verb is made causative, its direct
object is marked with -§m ‘goal’ and the causee is marked as the direct
object, and (2) reflexivization identifles the direct object with the subject,
then example 256 is problematic. We assume that the agent of H IT is the
subject and the patiënt is the direct object, as consistent with UTAH , the
“ uniformity of theta assignment hypothesis” (Baker 1988:46f).
• If, on the one hand, we flrst apply causativization and then reflexiviza­
  tion, as in the first diagram in figure 5.5, the order o f verbal suffixes is
  correct but the subject o f the whole is incorrectly identified as the agent
  of HIT.
• If, on the other hand, we apply reflexivization before causativization, as
  in the second diagram in figure 5.5, the verbal suffixes are incorrectly
  ordered. Further, the patiënt of H IT ends up as the direct object rather
  than the goal, so would incorrectly bear -khe (-ke) rather than -§m (-vu)
  (as in 256).","[178, 179]"

order o f the high and low tones is the means by which a message is sent
and understood. For example, lb is drummed as in la (with no extra pause
at word boundaries).
(l)a.HL        H H L L
   b. ?i kjho: kha cé ti $ha      ‘Come here now!’
      icyoocaré       dicha
Because many words have identical tone and syllable patterns it is neces-
sary to have standardized phrases. A given message may have a number
of different phrases; these may be repeated several times and in varying
orders, but the word order within each phrase is rigid.
    How someone would be called to come is illustrated in table 1.1. First,
the call notice is drummed. This varies depending on whether one or more
than one person is being called, and on whether the person (or persons) is
instructed to come immediately or at their convenience. Second, the name
of the person or persons being called is drummed, first the clan name and
then the personal name (or names). Finally, the purpose for wanting the
person(s) to come is drummed.","[57, 58]"

Chapter 11CliticsEnclitics (which we generally refer to simply as “ clitics”) have syntactic or
semantic “ scope” over an entire phrase. They attach themselves phono-
logically to the last word o f a phrase.1 Bora uses the following types of
clitics (among others, e.g., the personal pronominal subject proclitics of
table 10.1, page 270):
1. Second p o s it io n clitics occur only following a clause’s first con­
   stituent; these include:
   (a) TEMPORAL, i.e., ones that indicate tense (the time of an event rel­
       ative to the time o f speaking) are -phe ~ -© o ‘remote past’, -(?)ne
       ‘recent past’, and -iikjhè ~ -i ‘future’. These are discussed in section
       5.9.3. They are also included in figure 11.1; note that they do not
       all occupy the same position relative to the other clitics.
   (b) EVIDENTIAL, i.e., ones that indicate how the speaker came to know
       what she or he is reporting; see section 11.1.
   (c) The verb ‘to be’ ixkjha has become a second-position clitic in a type
       o f predicate complement structure; see section 5.10.2.
2. ADVERBIAL clitics follow various classes o f sentence constituent; see
   section 11.2.
3. A NEGATIVE clitic is discussed in section 13.3, page 13.3.
    The clitics occur in the order given in table 11.1:   *W e do N O T intend a strong claim that the morphemes discussed here are strictly clitics as
opposed to suffixes. Examples like 790, in w hich -ro ‘ frs’ precedes -:pè -(S gM ), suggest that
-ro is a suffix rather than a clitic.","[337, 338, 339]"
"5.1      Basic sentence structureThe basic clause has a subject and a predicate, and the subject precedes
the predicate. For example, in 209 the subject is the noun phrase o:?i:piè
‘dog’ and the predicate is the verb teï:nè ‘run’:(209) (3:?i-:pié      teï:né-?i (O ohn bye ds+tnéhi.) ‘The d og runs.’
      d o g - ( SgM ) run-(t)The subject may be a free, preverbal pronoun, as in 210:                         ©2012 SIL International ®
126                                    CHAPTER 5. M AIN CLAUSES AND VERBS
(210)a:nm $hèmé-?i (A an u ch em éh i.) ‘This one (SgM) is sick.’
     this be.ill-(t)
   A clause may contain many other phrases, the order of which may vary
considerably. (This word-order flexibility is undoubtedly due to Bora’s
healthy case system.)
   When the subject is an overt, preverbal pronoun, if it is either first or
second person and either dual or plural, then the verb bears the proclitic
me ~ ma1 ‘nonsingular speech-act participants’, which will be glossed SAP.
For example, in 211 the subject is first person plural exclusive (that is, it
does not include the hearer); in both the conditional and the main clause
the verb bears me ‘ SAP’:

           not we.ex SAP be.ill-neg-frs-(t)
           ‘ If we (ex.) had slept well, we would not have gotten sick.’In 212 the subject is second person plural:(2 1 2 ) im f amuha m ecuwahajchn tsa amuha m echém éftyuróhi.

           not you        SAP be.ill-fut-neg-frs-(t)
           ‘ If you (pl) sleep well, you are not likely to get sick.’Of course, me ~ ma- ‘SAP’ is not used when the subject is third person;
compare 213 with 211-212:(213) Im f d itye cuwahajchn tsa d itye ch ém éftyu róhi.

these parts varies in the interest o f saving space. (1) The Bora example is
written in a phonetic or phonemic form using the International Phonetic
Alphabet (IPA). (2) The example is also written in the Bora writing
system, with this sort o f font (sans serif). This is sometimes located
above the phonetic / phonemic representation and sometimes following
the phonetic / phonemic form (in parentheses). (3) A
morpheme-by-morpheme gloss is given either below the Bora example or
in parentheses following it. (4) A free translation follows, either on a line
below the morpheme-by-morpheme text or following it at the end o f the
line.
BORA C ITATIO N FORMS:
(a) Words given “ in isolation” (i.e., without any preceding or following
text) may meet the conditions for the application of either PLTS or FLTS.
If so, the isolation form will be the output o f the rule (which is how it
would be pronounced in isolation). (b) Sometimes the phonetic /
phonemic representation of words, roots, affixes,...make lexically                            ©2012 SIL International ®

marked tones explicit, as discussed below, while omitting the tones of
other syllables. (c) When verbs are cited, the phonetic / phonemic
representation may make lexically marked tones explicit whereas the
orthographic form gives the nonfinite form; see section 4.1, page 100,
especially figure 4.1. For example, akpakhumrn (awacunu) ‘to yawn’.
PHRASE MARKERS:
Phrase markers ( “ trees”) with which structure is represented are
intended as suggestive, neither definitive nor what would might be
expected for any particular theoretic perspective. Some sentences are
given with a rather flat structure. This makes it easier to deal with Bora’s
relatively free word order, but at the cost o f sometimes obscuring
subcategorization relationships. For example, see the tree given for
example 662, page 277. Some affixes are treated as separate syntactic
constituents; for example, case markers are treated as postpositions.
TONE DERIVATIONS:
The Bora forms in tone derivations are written as Bora people normally
read and write their language. Tone derivations use the font with
which this sentence is written.
LETTERS REPRESENTING USES OF TONE:
We sometimes use v to highlight a high tone and v to highlight a low
tone. Further, to help the reader keep track of different uses o f tone, we
sometimes indicate the use by writing a small letter over the vowel.
These letters are as follows:
              LETTER   TONE                USE
              c
              V        lo w to n e         cla ssifier

Neither ordering o f reflexivization and causativization yields a satisfactory
result. Figure 5.6 seems correct but is inconsistent with the generalization
that, when transitive verbs are causativized, the subject (causee) becomes
the direct object and the direct object becomes a goal.","[179, 180]"

Chapter 10Case and Grammatical
RelationsCase marking suffixes indicate the role o f a noun phrase (or subordinate
clause) with respect to the clause within which it occurs. Bora has the
following case markers: -0 ‘nominative’ for subjects ( 10.1), -khe ~ 0 (with
animate and inanimate phrases, respectively) ‘direct object’ ( 10.2),
‘goal’ or ‘theme’ (10.3), -thm ‘source’ (10.4), -fi ‘inanimate obliques’ (10.5),
-ma ‘with’ (10.6), and -$i:?è ‘motive’ (10.7). In addition to these, there are
two “ pseudo-cases”: -?tm ‘comparative’ (10.8) and -x ‘vocative’ (10.9).
    Some of the case-marking alternatives are illustrated in 625. 625a has
a singular transitive verb whereas 625b-d have an intransitive verb.

10.1        SubjectSubjects are not marked for case; that is, the nominative is unmarked. (An
exception is discussed below.) Subjects are recognized by the absence of
another case marker, by their position in the sentence, or by the classifier
suffixed to the verb.
   There are three possible patterns for the subject and predicate, as rep­
resented in 626a, b, and d:(626) a.    ( N   P sub je c t)     [p r e d ic a te       '   '         ^ (j)      b *   [p r e d ic a te   . . . V e r b ] - c l a s s i f i e r s u b je c t   (   @ N P s u b je c t )      c.    NPsubject [predicate •**verb]-[classifiersubject]

First, as represented in 626a, the subject may be a noun phrase preceding
the verb, as in as in 627-629. In this case the verb is followed by - © 0 ? ï
(t) or, when negative, by -(00 nG (n) as ïn 837, page 326. This order is
the one most commonly used to introducé a referent into the discourse.","[300, 301, 302]"

Chapter 7Nouns and Noun PhrasesNoun phrases refer to persons, animals, things and abstract ideas (actions,
events, states). They are formed from nouns, pronouns, numbers, nonfi­
nite verbs, and classifiers.
    To join elements with a noun or noun phrase to form referring expres­
sions, generally languages make liberal use of constituency, conjunction,
and compounding. Bora, by contrast, favors other mechanisms because it
has an ample set o f classifiers. These play a major role in the formation of
noun phrases, arguably heading them. For example, in the-tehi ‘that baby’,
the head is the classifier -tehi (baby) and this is modified by the demon­
strative “ adjective” the(:)- ‘that’. See chapter 6 for a detailed discussion of
classifiers.
    Various mechanisms for forming referring expressions are given in ta­
ble 7.1 roughly in the order o f their frequency of use.1 The significance of
this table should become clear as this chapter is read.","[222, 223]"

226                                 CHAPTER 7. NOUNS AND NOUN PHRASES
7.8.4     Adjectives used as adverbsSome adjectives may be used adverbially. For example, in 505a imi (im i)
‘good’ is a predicate adjective modifying the subject kharakha ‘chicken’ but
in 505b it modifies the verb max$hó?i ‘eat’:
(5 0 5 ) a_ f mf caraca.
       b. Im f ca ra ca m ajchóhi.
       a. imi? kharakha                 ‘It is a good chicken.’
          good chicken
       b. imi? kharakha max$hó-?i       ‘The chicken eats well.’
          good chicken eat-(t)
The word order in 505b is interesting: it is as though the adverb is predi-
cated o f “the chicken eats.” To characterize the chicken as good— without
“ good” being interpreted as an adverb, as in 505b— it is necessary to com­
bine imi ‘good’ with a classifier and make “ chicken” appositive to the com-
bination, as in 506:(506) Im iib ye ca ra ca m ajchóhi.
      imi-:piè(O kharakha max$hó-?i ‘The good chicken eats.’
      good-(SgM)         chicken eat-(t)
Another example of an adjective used adverbially follows:
(5 0 7 ) M ftyan e fm fjyuuvém e.
       mitjha-nè imihjm-:§é-mè          ‘They became very happy.’
       much-(0) happy-sIn-(AnPl)
7.8.5      Suffixes added to adjectivesThere are three suffixes that can be added to an adjective: -kpm(:) (wuu
~ wu) ‘diminutive’ (7.8.5.1), -i$ho (ic h o ) ‘somewhat’ (7.8.5.2) (the co-
occurrence of these is discussed in section 7.8.5.3), and -(Om^m (-uvu)
‘max’ (7.8.5.4).
7.8.5.1 -wuu ~ -wu ‘diminutive, very’The suffix -kpium (-wuu) ‘dim’ is used to enhance the meaning o f its host.
-kpm is used word finally and -kpium is used when some suffix follows;
compare mé:m-kpm ‘little pig’ with mé:m-kpmm-mm /mé:ni-kpm:-mm/ ‘lit­
tle pigs’.","[259, 260]"
"   With preverbal subjects, teha?(a) ‘not’ is added to the beginning o f the
clause, as in 837-840:

Three features of negatives suggest that negative clauses are structurally
subordinate clauses, complements to a higher predicate teha?a ‘not’:
1. low tone on the proclitic subject pronoun,
2. high tone on the verb’s first syllable, and
3. -ne (n) at the end o f the clause. Although this has been glossed (n),
   it may be the suffix glossed (0) that is used in forming subordinate
   clauses.
The structure of 839 would be as in 841:
(841) [v teha? ] [NP [s [NP o ] a:?i§è-thrn ] -nè ]
         not                I go.home-neg -(0)

        not I eat-go.do-neg-(n)    teha?(a) ‘not’ may be followed by the clitic -i ‘projected time’ (PT); in
this case the negation applies to the meaning of the clitic. For example, in
845 teha?ai (not-PT) denies that the event has already happened:1
(845) Tsahai dibye tsaatune.
        teha?a-i [ti-p’è  teha:-thm ]-nè               ‘He has not yet come.’
        not-PT that-(SgM) come-neg -(n)     With postverbal subjects, there is no overt negative word (like teha?(a)
‘not’ in the previous examples) and the classifier subject occupies the place
o f -ne (0). Thus, two arguments for the claim that these negatives are sub­
ordinate are not available; the only available argument is that the first syl­
lable of the verb bears high tone (as characteristic of subordinate clauses).
Examples follow. In 846, -©:pè (SgM) delinks the low tone o f -© thm ‘neg’
in order to place its low tone on -thm.
(846) maxtfhó-thm-:pè (Majchótuube.) ‘He has not eaten (bread).’
      eat-neg-(SgM)

      c. maxtfho-thm-mè (majchotume)                 ‘They have not eaten
                                                      (bread).’13.3        Contrastive negation with -j++va ‘deny’-hi:(§a) (-j++va) ‘deny’ indicates contrastive or emphatic negation, denying
that the referent o f the phrase to which it is cliticized was or did what has
been asserted (or assumed) about it. The form -hi:§a is used at the end of
a sentence and -hi: is used within a sentence. -hi:(§a) may be cliticized to
verbs (13.3.1) or to nominals (13.3.2).

analyzed either as in 1194b or as in 1194c:

In 1194b, the direct object ‘manioc’ is attached to the verb ‘we peel’ and
then this phrase is attached t o ‘we wash’. ; hence [[DO s-V] s-V]. In 1194c,
on the other hand, the attachment of ‘manioc’ is deferred until ‘we peel
(it)’ has been attached to ‘we wash’; hence [DO [s-V s-V]].","[508, 509, 510]"

      that- (0) -only-now-nwit-rem11.1         Evidential cliticsThe evidential clitics are -?ha ‘nonwitnessed’ and -§a ‘reportative’.
    There is no clitic indicating direct, first hand information, but the ab­
sence of an evidential clitic (in a declarative sentence) implies first hand
infomation. If a speaker fails to include an evidential clitic when reporting
an event he or she did not witness, they may be challenged by the hearer.
11.1.1       -hja ‘nonwitnessed’The evidential -?ha (-hja) ‘nonwitnessed’ indicates that the speaker did
not see, hear, smell, or have tactile experience regarding what she or he is
saying. It always co-occurs with either -phe ~ -(©o ‘remote past’ or -(?)ne
‘recent past’. The effect of -?ha ‘nonwitnessed’ in 761 is to indicate that,
although we saw what you made, we did not see you make it:

Example 764 implies that the speaker saw the burned house, but the effect
o f adding -?ha (-hja) ‘nonwitnessed’ is to indicate that he did not see it
while it was burning, only some considerable time after it burned:(764) o ajtyumt tsajahjaajaa anvyeja.

11.1.2       -va. ‘reportative’-§a (-va) ‘reportative’ indicates that the speaker is reporting something
said by another person. It is used both like a reportative evidential and
as a marker of indirect quotation. It is used in folktales and legends. -§a
may follow the first constituent of either a main clause, as in 765, or a
subordinate clause as in 766b:
(765) Diibyéva pee uumaa.

      ‘The one who went to hunt got lost.’
   Second, as represented in 626b, a third person subject may be indicated
by a classifier suffixed to the verb. This order is generally used if the                                                       ©2012 SIL International ®

subject has been previously introduced into the discourse. For example,
in 630 the subject is the classifier - 0 :PG( _;be) (SgM):1
(630) $i:paha:-thé-épè  (Llffnajaatéébe.) ‘He went to hunt.’
      hunt-go.do- (SgM)
   A classifier subject may be followed by an appositive subject noun
phrase, as in 631:
(631) “ Juuju” neebévaa fllif.
        “ hm:hm” nè-:pé-§a-a       <0 1^11                        ‘ “ OK,” said his son.
          OK     say-(SgM)-rpt-rem     his.son
    Every clause must have a subject. If there is no classifier on the verb,
there must be a preverbal subject.2 Further, as in 626c, preverbal sub­
jects do not co-occur with classifier subjects;3 see the preverbal subject
constraint discussed on page 129.
   Third, as represented in 626d, if the predicate is a noun or adjective
phrase, the subject usually follows the predicate, as in 632:
(632 )né?m(?) hm:§a (...néhnfjuuva) ‘ ...it is a bad trail.’
      bad     trail
   We mentioned above that there was one exception to the claim that
the nominative case is unmarked. As stated in section 8.1, when a per­
sonal pronoun is used as a preverbal subject, if it has a long vowel, this is
shortened. For example, ti-:piè tip’è, as in 633:
(633)            Tsa dibye pééityu.
        teha? ti-piè   phé:-i-tjhm              ‘He does not go.’
        not that-(SgM) go-fut-neg
This also applies in subordinate clauses, as in 634. (See also 864, page
332.)

     (b) It could be a low tone prefix (© - ) that forces the initial syllable
       to bear high tone: #©-cr...-suffix. (The host’s first syllable would
       have to bear high tone to avoid violating the *LLX constriant.)
       This suggestion can be immediately rejected. Recall that o ‘I’,
       m ‘you’, i ‘self’, and me ‘SAP’ are proclitics that form a tonal
       phrase with the following verb. If © occurred between the pro­
       clitic and the verb, the proclitic should necessarily bear high tone.
       (Otherwise it and the following © - would violate the *LLX con­
       straint.) However, this is not the case, as seen in mè max^ho-khi
       (SAP eat-pur memajchoki) ‘in order that we eat’ and 1max$hó-nè-ma
       (self eat-(event)-with imajchónema) ‘after eating’.
2. The initial high tone would be imposed by an independent process of
   subordination, and the suffixes of table 3.3 would subcategorize for a
   subordinate clause. For example, the subcategorization frame o f -(©khi
   ‘purpose’ would be [[s[+Subordmate]---]_] (the verb being final within
   the subordinate clause). This subordination process could be imple­
   mented in either of the just-mentioned ways, namely simply imposing
   high tone on the verb’s first syllable or by a low tone prefix.
Thus, we adopt the third possibility: (1) the suffixes o f table 3.3 subcatego­
rize for a subordinate clause, and (2) subordination is marked by docking
a high tone on the verb’s initial syllable. The derivations o f imipax^ho-khi
‘to fix’ and max$hó-mè-khè ‘the ones (AnPl) who eat-objAn’ (from exam­
ple 106c) are given in figure 3.34. In the latter, - © ©m e (AnPl) can not
doek its low tone because this would displace the high tone that marks
subordination.30

    Finally, -ne (event)— in contrast to - © ©ne (0) (thing) and the -ne (n)
(discussed in section 13.2)— seems to delink any preceding low tones ex­
cept the root’s lexically marked tones; see the derivation of teihi§é-tehó-i-

PrefaceThis book is intended as a baseline description o f the the Bora language.1
It makes both structural and functional claims. Most o f the description is
framed in terms of basic notions accepted across linguistic theories; occa-
sionally we make a theory-specific excursus.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"

10.2.4      CauseeA CAUSEE is the subject o f a clause that has been made causative (not to
be confused with the CAUSER, the one who does the causing). As in many
languages, in Bora, the causee becomes the direct object, as represented
schematically in figure 10.1:
                                [ SUBJECT        ...   VERB ]
                                       I                I
                     CAUSER          CAUSEE             |            CAUSE

2. The proclitic and the verb root’s initial syllable may not both bear low
   tones because these form a single tonal phrase which must respect the
   *LLX constraint.
3. ti ‘you (imperative)’ and i ‘self’ cause a following consonant to be
   palatalized. (Palatalization applies across word boundaries only if the
   words belong to the same phonological phrase.)
   Further, t(i) ‘you (imperative)’ may be ti, t, or 0 (nothing) depending
   on the number o f syllables o f the root and whether it begins with a
   consonant or a vowel.
   If o ‘I’, m ‘you’, or me ‘SAP’ is used as the subject and bears any suffix,
then it is repeated, procliticized to the verb. We will call this PRONOUN
DOUBLING. For example, in 637 o ‘ I’ is followed by -i ‘projected time’, so
the pronoun is repeated:
(637)ó-i o phé-hmkhó:-?i (Ói o péjucóóhi.) ‘I am now about to go.’
     I-PT I go-now-(t)
In 638 m ‘you’ is doubled:
(638)m:-3a m phè-é-?i       (U u va u p eé h i.)   ‘They say that
     you-rpt you go-fut-(t)                    you will go.’
In 639 me ‘ SAP’ is doubled; the second cliticizes to the verb:
(639)             M etsu m eere m epéékif.
        mètehm mè-:rè   mè phé:-khi:                  ‘Let’s go alone.’
        let.us SAP-only SAP go-pur
   When me ‘SAP’ is the subject, it can be preceded by mm?a ‘we (ex.)’,
mm?tehi ‘we (DuM)’, or mm?phi ‘we (DuF)’. A word may intervene between
the free pronoun and the pronominal clitic, for example, ti:pièkhè in 640:
(640) Muha dnbyeke méajtyum+hi.
      mm?a ti-:piè-khè      mé axtjhmmi-?i                       ‘We sawhim.’

   A preverbal subject noun phrase referring to aspeech act partici­
pant (i.e., not third person) will always be accompanied by an appositive
pronominal subject proclitic, as in 641 and 642:

       ‘When I was in town I saw him (lit. Being in town, I saw him).’    Adverbs (and other constituents, e.g., direct objects as in 640) may
intervene between the subject noun phrase or free pronoun and the subject
agreement proclitic. Examples follow:(6 4 3 ) Ói ++cui o péju cóóhi.
       ó-i i:khmi o phé-hmkhó:-?i            ‘I’m now about to go quickly.’

       ‘When I was in town, I saw him from afar.’
   Whether the subject is an overt pronoun or a classifier suffixed to the
verb, another noun phrase may be appositive to it. The appositive noun
phrase may follow the pronoun, the verb, or the classifier. In 645 the noun
phrase is appositive to the classifier -:pe (SgM). Compare this with 636a
and b, in which the noun phrase is appositive to a free pronoun.

       be.ill-(SgM)   my      father
   The appositional phrase may be a relative clause. For example, in 646
thapa?pè ‘my brother’ is followed by $héméro:pè ‘the one who is sick’:

by -0 k h®£ (-ke) ‘objAn’.
    The direct object may be a pronoun, a noun phrase, or a nominalized
clause. For example, in 648 it is the pronoun o ‘I’. Since this is animate, it
bears -0 k he ‘objAn’:
(648 )o-khè i:thè-:pè    (Oke ++teébe.) ‘He looks at me.’
      I-objAn look-(SgM)
In 649 the direct object is mmè?è ‘tree’; since it is inanimate it does not

"18.1     The structure of relative clausesBora relative clauses are always verb final, and always headed by a clas­
sifier following the verb. The noun or noun phrase that— in other lan-

lationships to the modifying clause with the following classifier. Four pos-
sibilities are represented in table 18.1. (The gap in the relative clause is
represented by 0i. This is coindexed with the classifier head and, if present,
an overt coreferential NP. The verb of the subordinate clause bears a high
tone on its first syllable, represented here by an s over the verb’s initial

   object o f the modifying clause, but there is no overt coreferential NP.b. Frequently the noun or noun phrase that in other languages would head
   the relative clause precedes the relative clause. The relative clause is
   appositive to it. These are discussed in section 18.1.1.c. Alternatively, the coreferential noun phrase may occur within the rel­
   ative clause. These are discussed in section 18.1.2.d. Finally, the relative clause may “ possess” the head, employing the gen­

"R E L A T IV E C L A U S E S :
In 1030, page 392, the subject of the relative clause, indicated by i ‘self’,
is coreferential with the subject of the main clause.
   In 539, the three cases o f i ‘self’ refer to the subject o f the main clause.
The two that are underlined indicate the subjects o f subordinate clauses;
the other (in the first word) is part of a possessive pronoun:

         ‘Having caused the loss of his own, he wants to get yours.’    We now turn to cases in which the anaphor is the modifier (possessor)
in a genitive construction. In 540a the anaphor i ‘self’ modifies (possesses)

‘house’ and refers to the sentence’s subject (John). By contrast, in 540b
the personal pronoun ti-:pie must refer to someone outside o f this domain,
that is, someone other than John:
(5 4 0 ) a. Jóaa p ee ihjyavu.
      b. Jóaa p éé dffbyé ja vu .
                        a. i?        hja-§m

                           that-(SgM) house-goal      a. ‘John* went to his* house.’
      b. ‘Johnj went to hisj house, (i = j ) ’And i ‘self’ behaves as an anaphor when it is part of a free possessive
pronoun. For example, i?pe ‘self’s (thing)’ must refer to something pos­
sessed by the referent of a nearby expression,one close enough to bind
the anaphor. In 564, page 248, it refers to the sentence’s subject.
   Although i ‘self’ behaves like a typical anaphor in the majority of cases,
some cases are unexpected. For example, in 541 it refers to the subject of
the sentence, but that subject is outside o f the immediate clause o f the
anaphor:
(541) Jóaa w aajacu foohffbye ds+j+véne.
      hóaaj kpa:hakhm-? [ï* © (3:?i-:piè  teihï^é ]-nè
      John know-(t)      self   dog-(SgM) die       -(0)
      ‘John* knows that his* dog died.’Example 542 is perhaps even more problematic. Generally anaphors must
be coreferential to a noun phrase that is in a structurally more prominent
position. However, in 542 i refers from within the subject to the direct
object, which presumably is not more prominent:(542) Io o h ffb ye Jóaake thdóhi.
      1 © (3:?i-:piè hóa:-khè   ï?tó-?i              ‘John*’s dog bit himj.’
      self dog-(SgM) John-objAn bite-(t)
Technically, the binding expression should c-command the anaphor. Fur­
ther, subjects generally c-command objects, but objects do not c-command
subjects. This may be evidence that Bora has a “ flat” structure, one lacking
a verb phrase. However, this raises other questions beyond the scope of
this grammar. We leave the question as an outstanding research issue.","[272, 273]"

undergo inversion:
(667) Ané(h), wa(h) pfcyaméf dfpam+j+wuunevuj.
       ané?, kpa? phikjha-méi ti    pha-mi-hi-kpmm-nè-§m-x
       then sis putlmp-^f) your all-(ornament)-pl-dim-thm-voc
       ‘Then, sis, put on all your little jewels.’The goal is the girl and theme is the ornaments. A possible analysis is
that— by inversion— the goal becomes the direct object and the theme
becomes an oblique. However, the goal-become-object does not surface
because of reflexivization. This is represented in 10.6:                      AGENT    THEME G0AL[+anim]

    Consider example 668. Understood as ‘The mother put jackets on the
children...’ it seems like a convincing case o f inversion. However, this is
not so because mxkho does not mean ‘put on’ but ‘insert into’, so it is natural
to treat the children as the direct object and the jackets as the goal.

          your    house picture -thm
       ‘I urge you to show me a picture of your house.’There are two possible explanations. First, for many verbs the direct object
is a theme (in the semantic sense), so -§m ‘theme’ may be used to preserve
the mapping between the semantic role and the form that generally marks
it.
    Second, there may be reason to posit a grammatical relation of
OBLIQUE OBJECT which would subsume GOAL and be marked by -§m.
This would follow direct object on the following hierarchy o f grammat­
ical relations:    SUBJECT >- DIRECT OBJECT >- OBLIQUE OBJECT ^ O t h e r OBLIQUES                             ©2012 SIL International ®
282                      CHAPTER 10. CASE AND GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS
The direct object of a causative verb would be marked with           because
its prior grammatical relation, direct object, is usurped by the CAUSEE; to
have a distinct case marking it takes the next relation in the hierarchy, the
oblique object.
   While the object o f a transitive is generally marked with        ‘thm’
when causativized, this is not always the case. In 671 it is treated as an
inanimate object and thus has no explicit case marking. We do not know
why.

referring to a being or object of the type indicated by the classifier; see
chapter 18. In this section we consider subordinate clauses in which the
classifier following the verb is -ne (0 ) ( ‘thing’). These are C O M P L E M E N T S ,
and may function as the subject o f a sentence (16.2.1) or as direct objects
(16.2.2).
   Some subordinate clauses, such as that in 948, are ambiguous between
a complement and a relative clause. This comes about because the max-
imally unspecified classifier -ne (0) may refer either to a object or to an
event, as discussed in section 16.3.(948) Ó ajtyumt dibye majchone.

16.2.1       Subject complementsThe subject of a sentence may be a subordinate clause. For example, in
949 the subject is ti:piè phé:nè: ‘that he goes’, i?tatehó(?) ‘sad’ is a predicate
adjective, and the copula is implicit:(949) Ihdatsó diibye pééneé.
       i?tatehó(?) [ti-ip’è   phe: ]-nè: ‘It is sad that he goes.’
       sad         that-(SgM) go     -(0)
16.2.2       Object complementsThe following verbs (among many others) take object complements:
axtjhmmi ‘see’, i:the ‘look’, $e:po ‘hear’, imi^e ‘want’, phi:^iethe ‘be able’,
and kpa:hakhm ‘know’. The object complement usually follows the
complement-taking verb, but it may also precede it.
    The verb of the complement always bears a high tone on the first syl­
lable and is always followed by     O nE (0)-3 - © O nG does not impose its
(1) on a monosyllabic or bisyllabic verb because the initial syllable must
                                                 Lbear high tone. Further, the tones o f # ...- O O ne (0) do not override the
tones imposed by, for example, a preceding - O O tm ‘like’ or -OOi.Pm ‘g°
after doing’.
    We now present various examples. Note that in 950a the subject o f the
complement, which is coreferential to the subject of the main clause, is
a pronoun; it is not— as might be expected— an anaphor. By contrast, in
951, in which the subject o f the complement is third person, the anaphor
i ‘self’ is used.

a sensory verb in 952b:

   Another case is that o f mï-nè transport-(0) ‘canoe’. By itself, the root
   mi- does not refer to a canoe; rather, it means quite generally ‘trans­
   portation’. However, it does refer to a canoe when combined with -nè
   (0), which (1) satisfies the structural requirement for a head, and (2) de­
   notes a class o f objects, thus enabling the phrase to refer.12
5. It might be possible to formulate an argument against the claim that
   classifiers head their phrases based on the remarkable behavior of clas­
   sifiers with numeral phrases.
   When a numeral phrase is used to quantify a noun, that noun must agree
   in animacy, gender and number. For example, consider 478, page 218.
   The phrase that means ‘six’ ends with an animate, singular, masculine
   classifier because ‘ six’ is literally ‘one from this hand’. When this phrase
   quantifies a noun (phrase), it must agree in animacy, number and gen­
   der. Thus, in ‘six dogs’— contrary to what one might expect— ‘dogs’ is
   marked as singular and masculine. See section 7.7.2 for further discus-
   sion. However, this lends further support for the claim that classifiers
   head their phrases. What matters are the features of the the numeral
   phrase and the noun, which are precisely the features of the classifiers
   with which each ends. That is, the classifiers determine the features of
   their phrase, even though these features do not reflect the semantics of
   the expression.
    To conclude this section (6.3), it should be clear that Bora classifiers
are eminently nominal. Here we have made a stronger claim: that Bora
classifiers are nouns. By doing so, it follows that Bora classifiers should
share the major properties o f nouns: the types o f meanings they encode,
the grammatical functions they may have, their distribution/use, and so
forth. Indeed, they do except that they have a more restricted distribu­
tion than other nouns. And this restricted distribution is due to a simple
property: that they are bound.
    Based on the claim that Bora classifiers are nouns, it seems reasonable
to think that what have been called “ classifiers” in Bora are not really
such, but simply a subclass o f nouns. We will not try to resolve this issue
here because the answer depends on whether one believes in universal
category definitions or that ultimately each category must be defined for
each language.","[221, 222]"
"
7.1       AppositionThe primary mechanism for combining various nominal words into a noun
phrase is apposition, not— as in most languages— constituency.2 Patterns
like those in 390 are frequent (and in some cases the appositive parts are
discontinuous).
(3 9 0 )a. NPj (© NPj (© NP;...
        b. verb-(classifier); (© NP; © NP; ...
   The classifiers play an important role in linking the various parts of a
phrase. Consider 391 for example:
(391)    Diibye wajpi cdracddfvu ó ajcuube péjucóóhi.
        ti-:piè    © kpaxphi © [kharakha-ti-§m
        that-(SgM)   man        chicken-anim-thm        ó 0i axkhm ]-:pè;  phé-hmkhó:-?i
        I    give   -(SgM) go-now-(t)
        ‘The man to whom I gave the chicken left.’The first noun phrase, ti-:piè ‘that (SgM)’ is a determiner-based pronoun;
the second, kpaxphi ‘man’ is a noun; and the third, kharakhati§m ó axkhm:pè
‘the one (SgM) to whom I gave the chicken’ is a relative clause. kpaxphi   2By apposition w e mean the use o f tw o or m ore referring expressions, possibly discontinu­
ous, interpreted as having the same referent, but lacking a syntactic relationship. Apposition
depends on an interpretive link in a w a y that constituency does not.",[224]
"6.2      The uses of classifiersThis section surveys the various ways classifiers are used. Classifiers may
follow finite verbs to indicate the subject (6.2.1). Aside from this case,
what precedes the classifier modifies the classifier. This may be a simple
adjective (6.2.2). It may be a bound noun (6.2.3) or a bound stem such as
demonstrative, indefinite, and interrogative modifiers (6.2.4.1), numerals
and quantifiers (6.2.4.2) or a(:)- ‘thematic’ to form connectives (6.2.4.3).
What precedes a classifier may be a nonfinite verb which, with the clas­
sifier, forms a derived noun, e.g., ‘doctor’ from ‘treat’ (6.2.5). Classifiers
may head relative clauses (6.2.6) or perhaps, in the case o f -ne (0), func-
tion like a subordinator (6.2.7). What precedes the classifier may be a free
possessive pronoun (6.2.8) or a collective or general noun, in which case
the classifier “individuates” it (6.2.9). Classifiers may occur multiple times
in a word (6.2.10). Classifiers may follow -e ‘pertain to’ or -eme ‘similar to’
(6.2.11). And classifiers play a vital referential role in discourse (6.2.12).",[207]

       b. ‘After having fixed it, he carried (it) off.’Both types of -ne are present in mèkha?khmxtehónè mèimipai^éné in figure
16.5; this is a subordinate clause which has a subordinate adverbial clause
within it:7 The adverbial clause bears -ne (event) while the clause in which
it is embedded bears -ne (0). (The tone o f the proclitics is explained in
section 3.12.2, page 93.)   5The distinction corresponds closely to w hat Langacker calls objects and interactions; he
writes (Langacker 1991:183):
       Conceptually, objects and interactions present a maxim al contrast, having op-
       posite values for such properties as dom ain o f instantiation (space vs. tim e),
       essential constituent (substance vs. energy transfer), and the possibility o f
       conceptualizing one independently o f the other (autonomous vs. dependent).
       Physical objects and energetic interactions provide the respective prototypes
       for the noun and verb categories, w hich likew ise represent a polar opposition
       am ong the basic gram m atical classes.",[399]
"
The use of qualifier phrasesQualifier phrases can be used like other noun phrases to refer to persons,
animals, or things. They are not used to introducé a new participant; they
are only used when the context provides a referent. With sufficiënt context
“ one” could be the subject, as in 497:(497) imia-:péteha:-?i (Im + a ab é t s a a h i.) ‘One who is
      proper-(SgM) come-(t )                           good comes.’
Or they can be the direct object:
(498 )mitjha-nè max$hó-mè (M fty a n e m ajch óm é.) ‘They ate a lot.’
      much-(0) eat-(AnPl)
    In most languages an adjective modifies a noun by means o f con­
stituency: [NP Adjective Noun]. However, in Bora adjectives are made                                 ©2012 SIL International ®
7.8. ADJECTIVES                                                                  225
into qualifier phrases and the nouns they modify are in apposition. For
example, consider 499 in which kpaxphi ‘man’ is in apposition to imia-:pé
‘good one’:(4 9 9 ) Im +aabé w ajpi tsaahi.
        imia-:pé     @ kpaxphi teha:-?i              ‘A good man comes.’
        proper-(SgM)  man     come-(t)
And this is the general case: qualifier phrases “modify” by the mecha­
nism o f apposition: QualifierP @ NP. Classifiers play the crucial roles of
(1) heading the qualifier phrase24 and (2) linking them referentially. For
further discussion see section 7.1.","[258, 259]"

17.2.1 “Normal” conditional clauses“ Normal” conditional adverbial clauses are formed with -?ah$hi:(hjm) (-
hajchnjyu) ‘i f ’. These indicate that the event o f the main clause depends
on that o f the subordinate clause. Sentence finally -?ax$hi:hjm (-h ajch n jyu )
is used, as in 971, and sentence medially -?ax^hi: (-h a jc h n ) is used, as in

8.1.2 The use of personal pronounsFirst and second person pronouns are used to refer to the speaker(s) and
hearer(s) as needed. Third person pronouns are used either to “point” to a
referent in the external context or to establish coreference with another
referring expression, usually one that has been previously established.
This latter use o f pronouns competes with two alternatives: (1) with the
anaphor i ‘self’, and (2) with the use of a classifier subject to refer to the
subject. We comment briefly on these in turn.
    First, i ‘self’ is an anaphor, so must be bound within a very local domain
(as discussed further in section 8.3) while the personal pronouns must not
be bound within that domain. For example, consider 531, the structure
o f which is represented in figure 8.1. The possessor in the subordinate
clause is ti-:piè (that-(SgM)) and it is bound from outside o f the subordinate
clause. (It could refer to the speaker’s brother or any other male other
than the speaker himself.) If instead it were i ‘self’, as in 1157, page 439,
it would be bound by the subject o f its clause and thus refer to “ me” rather
than to John.4

There are two ways we might think o f this. On the one hand, we might
regard kpathaxkho ‘cover’ as a transitive verb that subcategorizes for a direct
object, the object covered. On this view, ?joxtehi ‘hand’ would be regarded
as an adjunct that bears         (-v u ) ‘theme’ because it is the thing that
moves. This is the first alternative presented in figure 10.4. On the other
hand, we might regard kpathaxkho ‘cover’ as subcategorizing for both a
theme and a goal. If one expects the goal to be marked with             (-v u )
‘goal’ and the theme as a direct object, then the actual case marking would
require inversion, as represented in the second alternative o f figure 10.4.      [    girl   breast  ] hand                    [ girl hand          breast   ]

   We withhold judgement on this case. However, there is a case where an
inversion analysis is motivated for Bora.8 The verb axkhm (a jcu ) ‘give’ (and
perhaps a few other verbs) presents the recipient (goal) as the direct object
and marks the theme (that which passes from the giver to the recipient)
with      (-v u ) ‘goal/theme’; this is represented in figure 10.5:  8This inversion is similar to a phenomena described for Seri by M arlett (1993).","[311, 312]"

with (bound) quantifiers like pha- ‘all, completely’, as in 359.
(358) a. teha-?è    (tsahe)   ‘one (tree, bush, plant, etc.)’
         one-(tree)
      b. teha-kpa   (tsawa)   ‘one slab (plank, machete,...)’

      all-(slab)
      pha-:pè    (paabe) ‘all of him (SgM)’
      all-(SgM))
The resulting phrase is normally used in apposition to another noun
phrase. For example, in 360 miammnaa ‘people’ is modified by phaa:mai
‘all like sticks in a row’:
(360) M+amunaa juuvayf péé paaamai.
      mi ammnaa hm:§a-ji phé:-? pha-a:ma-i
      people      path-oblln go-(t) all-(in.row)-(stick)
      ‘People go on the path in a column, i.e., one behind another.’Deverbal classifiers (as discussed in 6.1.2) may also be used this way. For
example, in 361 the classifier -ï§ó?o:-m is derived from the verb i§o?o- ‘lie
face down’ by the addition of -m ‘DVC’. This is combined with pha- ‘all’ to
form a noun phrase that is appositive to -mi, the classifier subject on the
main verb:
(361) Teehf uniuri fjcyamt, m++ne pa+vóhoóu.

matic’ to form a sentential connective. For example, the phrases in 362
refer to a person, animal or thing mentioned in the previous sentence. For
further discussion see section 19.1.
(362) a. a:-$è       ( a a lle )                           ‘she’
         thm-(SgF)
      b. a:-mi       (aam+)          ‘that canoe (boat, car,...)’
         thm-(canoe)
      c. a-?a:mi     (a h a a m t) ‘that leaf (paper, book,...)’
         thm-(leaf)
      d. a:-?è       (a a h e )            ‘that tree (plant,...)’
         thm-(tree)
6.2.5     Classifiers with nonfinite verbsA verb is made nonfinite by adding a low tone regressive to the antepenult.
(The nonfinite low tone is indicated by N in the examples below. For
further details about the tonal modification, see figure 4.1, page 100.) A
nonfinite verb may be combined with a classifier to refer to an object (o f
the type indicated by the classifier) associated with the event indicated by
the verb.
   The examples of 329, page 165, are like agentive nominalizations. Note
that in 329e -xthe (AnPl) is used with a nonfinite verb, whereas in 346c
above - © ©m e (AnPl) is used (to indicate the subject) following finite
verbs.
   In the following examples the classifier refers to an object other than
the subject (agent) o f the nonfinite verb:(363) kpa:hakhm-?a:mi (w a a ja c u h d a m t) ‘book’
      knowing-(leaf)
      akhm:§è-kpa         (acuuvewa)          ‘bench’

6.2.6       Classifiers as heads of relative clausesA classifier may head a relative clause, either restrictive or nonrestrict-
ive. The initial syllable of the relative clause’s verb bears high tone, as
characteristic o f subordinate clauses. Examples follow:(364) o ajtyumt teemt fmibajchóóbeke.
       ó axtjhmmi-? [thè:-mï      imipax$hó ]-:pè-khè
       I see-(t) that-(canoe) fix             -(SgM)-objAn

        I-rem I sew        -(shelter) already deteriorate-(t)
       ‘The clothes that I sewed are now deteriorated.’
    As with adjective + classifier combinations, relative clauses headed by
a classifier may be appositive to a noun phrase, thereby modifying it; see
example 391, page 190. For further discussion and examples see chapter
18.","[209, 210, 211, 212]"

5.8.2     -mei ‘reflexive or passive’When -mei ‘reflexive or passive’ is attached to a transitive verb, the combi-
nation is an intransitive verb indicating that the subject (rather than some

   Adverbial subordinate clauses are discussed in chapter 17. There are
various types of nominal subordinate clauses. Relative clauses are dis­
cussed in chapter 18. Complements are dealt with here in section 16.2:
subject complements in section 16.2.1 and object complements in section
16.2.2.
   The first syllable o f the verb of a subordinate clause bears high tone,
represented here by S over the vowel. For example, compare 944a, a
subordinate clause headed by a verb with the initial high tone, with 944b,

5.8         Valence-changing suffixesThis section describes the valence-increasing suffix -teho ‘causative’ (5.8.1)
and the valence-decreasing suffixes -mei ‘reflexive or passive’ (5.8.2) and
-xkhatehi ‘reciprocal’ (5.8.3).
5.8.1       -tso ‘causative’The suffix -teho ‘causative (cause or allow)’ increases its host’s valence.
It makes an intransitive verb transitive, the direct object of which is the
CAUSEE; see section 10.2.4. For example, the subject o f the intransitive
clause in 253a is the first person. This becomes the causee— the direct
object— o f the corresponding transitive in 253b:
(253) a_ q ds+tnéhi.

          that-(SgM)-objAn die-caus-(SgM)              (transitive)
   When a transitive verb is made causative, its direct object is marked
with -§m ‘goal’ and the causee is marked as the direct object, as in 255.16
The grammatical relations of 255 are shown in figure 5.4.","[177, 178]"
"6.3.4      Classifiers head their phrases
In Bora the syntax of noun phrase formation is played out intemal to the
word. Indeed, the syntax o f noun phrases extemal to the word amounts to
little more than apposition; see section 7.1 for further discussion.
     We claim that—with the exception of classifiers used as (post-verbal)
subjects11— classifiers are the structural heads o f their phrases. Given that
classifiers are nouns, what is projected from them is a noun phrase. What
precedes (nonfinite verb, subordinate verb, demonstrative, numeral, quan-
tifier, adjective, and such) is a modifier.
    We now present various arguments:
1. The head o f a phrase is what gives the phrase its character. Formally, a
   head’s features are shared by the phrase projected from it. For example,
   assuming that dog is [+animate] and brown is [+color], the phrase the
   brown dog is [+animate] because its head, dog, is [ + animate]. It is
   not [+color] because brown is a modifier, not the phrase’s head. (The
   phrase very brown is [+color] because its head, brown, is [+color].)
   In Bora, kpa:hakhm ‘know’ is a verb having features like [+verbal,
   +cognitive], which it shares with its nonfinite form kpa:hakhm ‘know-
   ing’. Suppose this is combined with with -?a:mi (leaf) (paper, book,...),
  11It m ight be possible to extend the claim to these cases on an analysis that projects sen­
tences from their inflection, but w e do not pursue that possibility here.",[220]
"6.3.3     Classifiers have the distribution typical of nouns
Morphologically, classifiers are like nouns in bearing inflection for num-
ber and case; e.g., $hémè-mé-?hï-khè (be.ill-(AnPl)-pl-objAn) ‘to the sick
people’.
   Functionally, classifiers are like nouns in that they may indicate a sen-
tence’s subject (see 6.2.1), as illustrated with -:phe (SgM), -?e (tree) and
-ha (shelter) in 387:
(387) tha:po-:pè (Taaboóbe.) ‘He treats (medically).’
      ai:^iè-?è (Affvyehe.) ‘The tree is burning.’
      fmfifc'e-ha (Imffvyeja.) ‘The house (clothes,...) is finished.’
   Significantly, preverbal overt subjects do N O T co-occur with classifier
subjects. This is because the classifier IS the subject— not simply an agree-
ment marker.
   A subject indicated by a classifier following the verb may be followed
by an overt subject noun phrase, but this is appositive to the classifier
subject:
(388) [predicate*..verb] [subject -classifieri] (( (NPj)
   Like nouns, classifiers may head relative clauses; see examples 364-366
and discussion in section 6.2.6.
   And, like nouns, classifiers may have adpositional complements as, for
example, English (a ) table like this one. In Bora, this is i-kpa-èmé-kpa ‘a
slab (plank, table, machete,...) like this one’, in which -eme- ‘similar to’ is
a postposition. Compare the structures in figure 6.4:

                                                                               |     -(slab)

                       I I                             det         n        -èmé
                     this one                            I          I       -sim
                                                        i-        -kpa
                                                       this     -(slab)
                          Figure 6.4 ‘A table like this one.’
    In both cases there are two noun phrases. The lower refers to the object
of comparison while the higher refers to the object being likened to it. In
Bora both of these noun phrases are headed by an instance of -kpa (slab).
   Finally, as discussed in section 6.3.4, classifiers play a role within noun
phrases typical of nouns, that is, they head the noun phrase.","[219, 220]"
"19.3      Ellipsis and gappingIn a sufficiently rich context much of a sentence may be ellipsed, even the
verb. For example, in answer to the question in 1062, one could answer

Appendix BSpeculations on Diachronie
ProcessesThe following are speculations about how some forms may have developed
from earlier stages of the language:
1. Two suffixes have the form            One is glossed as ‘become’ (as in
   137); the other is glossed as ‘singular intransitive (sin)’ (as in 242).
   These are at least cognate; perhaps they are a single morpheme with
   two uses.
2. imipax$ho ‘fix’ may derive from *imi-pa-$ho (good-verbalizer-caus).
   Likewise, i?hjm§a ‘talk’ may derive from *i?hm-§a mouth-verbalizer and
   mxkha§a ‘become fat’ from *mxkha-§a- fat-verbalizer.
3. imihjm ‘happy’ may derive from *imi-hjm (good-speech); e.g., imihjm-
   :§é-mè ‘they became very happy’.
4. ïmi^’é- ‘finish’ may derive from imi-^ié- (good-verbalizer). (However
   ïmi^’é- is a transitive verb, whereas      generally derives intransitive
   verbs.)
5. i kpahjamm ‘his clothes’ may derive from i kpa-ha-mm (self (slab)-
   (shelter)-pl), perhaps because the body is perceived as roughly slab-
   shaped (like a plank).
6. Perhaps the /pa/ of -khopa ‘ augment’ is cognate with pha- ‘all, big’.
7. maxf ho ‘eat (bread)’ may derive from *mai-teho- (bread-cause), with the
   /*i/ palatalizing the /ts/. Support for this is found in the word ma?o
   ‘cassava bread’.
8. phi:^iè ‘grow’ may derive from phi-:§e. The *phi would have been ei­
   ther ‘body’ or ‘big’; the *-:§£ would have been either the verbalizer

412              APPENDIX B. SPECULATIONS ON DIACHRONIC PROCESSES
    ‘become’ or ‘sin’ (which, as suggested above, may have been the same
    morpheme).
9. -na:akha ‘meanwhile’ may derive from *-ne-a:kha ( ( 0} -realize). This may
   be due to either a historical or a morphophonemic process.
10. -? ixkjha1 ‘be’ forms a compound tense indicating imperfective aspect.
   It is frequently interpreted as habitual. It is now bound but was un-
   doubtedly free at some prior stage of the language.
11. -tehi (not palatalized) ~ -^hi (palatalized) (place} and -?m$e (yonder}
   ~      (root) ‘yonder, over there’ are probably cognate.
12. Consider the requirement that, when -§m ‘goal’ follows an animate
   phrase, the phrase must bear the suffix -(?)ti ‘animate’, as in example
   656, page 276. This suffix, which now appears to mark animacy, may
   have arisen from the pronoun ti ‘that’ in locational uses o f the genitive
   construction along the lines of      in example 660, page 276.
13. tehi:me ‘children’ may derive from tehi:-me (baby-ANPL) where tehi:- is
   cognate with the classifier -tehi (baby}.
14. The /hm/ o f        Ohmkho: ‘now, already; focus’ may be cognate with
   the /hm/ o f -Ohm-x ‘quick-vocative’.
15. -?i (t}, the tracé left when a subject is moved to before the verb, may
   be cognate with i ‘self’.
16. mi: ‘two’ may be cognate with -mm ‘dual’ as in -mmtehi (DuM} and
   -mmphi (DuF}.
17. -naa(:kha) ‘while’ (discussed in section 17.3 may be derived from -ne
   (event} and the adverbial clitic -ha(:ca) ‘realize’ (listed in 11.2).
18. The pronoun mmm ‘indefinite animate singular’ discussed in section
   14.3.2 may be cognate with -mm ‘plAn’.
19. The suffix - O O teha ‘each’ is probably cognate with the root teha- ‘one’.
20. See footnote 11, page 106, regarding probable source of certain verbs
   often used in compounds.
21. See chapter 15, footnote 2, regarding the possible historical develop-
   ment o f an interrogative suffix that docks a high tone on the host’s final
   syllable and causes the final vowel to change from /e/ to /a/.","[439, 440, 441, 442, 443, 444, 445, 446]"

(t) (5.4.1) or - © ©ne (n) (5.4.2).8
5.4.1 -hi ~ -h (t)
The morpheme - © © ? (i) (t) is suffixed to the verb o f the main clause, as
in 229:
(229) A vyéju u b e ihajkimuke n éé d itye ihjya nmibajchoki.
        a^iéhm-:pè i     ?axkhi-mm-khè né:-?(i) ti-tjhè

        self house self fix-pur
        ‘The chief told his people to fix his9 house.’This suffix occurs only with explicit preverbal subjects, as in 230a. It does
not co-occur with a classifier subject, as in the first alternative in 230b:
(230) a. ï:hm mmï§a-?i (I+ju um+va.) ‘The horse escaped.’
         horse escape-(t)              *mmi§a-:pé-?i             I
            {             (p f ^ (t) | (Um+vaabe.) ‘He escaped.’
                escape-(SgM)Nor does it occur in negative clauses; such cases are discussed in the next
section.
    The suffix - © © ? (i) (t) imposes a low tone on its host’s penult:(231) a. ó $e:né-?i (ó lleen éh i) ‘I eat (fruit).’
        b. ó i?§èthé-?i (ó th v e té h i) ‘I stop.’     8A theory that entertains some notion o f m ovem ent m ight consider (t) and (n ) to be
“ tracés” o f subjects that have been m oved to a preverbal position. This could be m otivated
by the follo w in g distributional facts: (1 ) (t) and (n ) never co-occur w ith a classifier subject,
presumably because they occupy the position o f classifier subjects, and (2 ) (t) and (n ) occur
i f and on ly i f there is an overt preverbal subject (pronoun, name, or noun phrase).
    9This could also refer to “ their” house, i.e., it could be bound by the indirect object rather
than the subject o f the higher clause. The interpretation given in 229 is preferred because
‘house’ is singular. If, how ever, the object w ere plural, that is i ’ Wa ?apè (s e lf house various)
‘his/their various houses’, then the favored interpretation w ou ld be ‘ their houses’ .","[164, 165]"

7. Bora’s tone system seems too complex. A reader commented, “You can’t
   be right. It is too complicated. How would children learn it?”
   We agree that our description— and the analysis implicit in it— are too
   complicated. Of course, the complexity of the facts themselves cannot
   be reduced. (Indeed, further study will undoubtedly bring to light more
   complexities.) The challenge, therefore, is to find analyses that reduce
   the complexity.
8. Bora— it seems— has no stress system aside from the system o f tone:
   there do not seem to be stressed versus unstressed syllables, only high
   tone versus low tone syllables. In basic design, the Bora tone system
   is not unlike the accentual system o f Lithuanian described by Kensto-
   wicz (1994:584ff.). We do not discount the possibility that Bora’s tone
   system is a stress system implemented on tone. Kenstowicz (1994)
   says that Milner proposes such an analysis for Winnebago; Kensto­
   wicz writes (p. 595) “The accent is interpreted as high tone” and (p.
   596) “ The accent in Winnebago is apparently realized tonally (Milner
   1979)”. (Consult Kenstowicz (1994) for references.)
9. Bora drum communication raises various intriguing questions: Given
   that there is relatively little lexical tone, why is it possible at all? What
   is the range o f messages that can be communicated? To what extent
   does it depend on conventional frames?
10. Across Bora clans there are small dialect differences, most promi-
   nently, with regard to palatalization. There are differences in tone.
   This merits further study.
   A language spoken to the north in Colombia, Muinane, is closely related
   to Bora. According to Mike Maxwell (personal communication) it has
   a pitch-accent system: very roughly, words begin with some number of
   high tone syllables and are thereafter followed by low tone syllables.
   Perhaps this is the result o f the collapse of a system like that of Bora.
   Tone has not been sufficiently studied in other members of the Witotoan
   family such as Witoto and Ocaina.
   Aschmann (1993) has done an admirable job of reconstructing the seg-
   mental phonology of Witotoan. However, reconstructing the system of
   tone is an outstanding challenge.","[131, 132]"

5.10.2        Aspect indicated by -?ixkjha ‘habitual’The verb ixkjha (ijcya) ‘be’ has an affixal form -?ixkjha (-hijcya) that, with
some exceptions, occurs as a second-position clitic, where it frequently
follows demonstrative pronouns. It indicates habitual or characteristic ac­
tion, and will be glossed ‘habitual’ (hab). For example, in 290 and 291
it follows the subject phrase o f a predicate complement construction indi-
cating a characteristic of the subject:   21Note that the pronoun does not begin w ith a short v o w e l despite its being the subject.
This must be due to the intervention o f -i ‘PT ’ betw een the pronoun and the verb. The same
is true when other clitics intervene; witness:

          that-(like) that-(SgM) existence            is like that.’In 293 -?ixkjha occurs on the direct object, but note that the apparent main
clause is really a subordinate clause (as indicated by the classifier and by
the verb’s initial high tone):
(2 9 3 ) O kéhijcya d itye ajcune.

       ‘They always give to me.’ (lit. ‘ It is to me that they give it.’)    Quite transparently, -?ixkjha is the verb ixkjha ‘be’ preceded by a
complement-terminating -? (the same ? that terminates predicate adjec­
tives, as discussed in section 7.8.3). This analysis is reflected in 294:(2 9 4 ) o peh fjcya mujcojuvu.

       ‘ I habitually go to the port.’Although this analysis is undoubtedly correct for some diachronie stage or
some synchronie level, there are some good reasons for considering it to
be a suffix:

156                              CHAPTER 5. M AIN CLAUSES AND VERBS
1. -? ixkjha and the word that precedes it belong to the same tonal phrase
   (respecting the *LLX constraint at the boundary between them).
2. -? ixkjha may suppress preaspiration in the verb to which it is suffixed.
   Such is the case in 295, where in each example the second instance of
   ixkjha ‘be’ suppresses the preaspiration of the first:
   (295) méfcyahfjcyahi
         mé ikjha-?         ixkjha-?i ‘we are continually being...’
         SAP be-PredAdj be-(t)
          icyahjjcyatsihdyu
         ikjha-?      ixkjha-tehi-?tjm  ‘upon that having been done’
         be-PredAdj be-(place)-sou
3. Nothing can intervene between -? and ixkjha. For example, if a subject
   marking proclitic occurs, it must precede the verb that -? ixkjha follows,
   as in 296:
   ,     Taiinuj+vu o pécooca ó avuhcuhfjcyaa pafjyuvaré tééhf
         panétu.
         tha ïipmhï-^m o phé-kho:kha ó a§m?khm-^     fxk'ha-:-v

         all-(time) -pl-only river      inside-sou
         ‘When I go to my land, I will bathe every day in the river.’
For these reasons we will generally treat the combination of -? and -ixkjha
as a single suffix. And this is consistent with the Bora writing system, in
which it is written as a suffix: -hijcya. Other examples are given in 297
and 298:
(297) Pafjyuvdré ó pehfjcya mujcojuvu.
      pha-ihjm-§a-fé      ó phè-?ixkjha-?i mmxkhohm-§m

      ‘When he goes to town, he will work regularly.’In most o f these examples the meaning is habitual; however in 1151, page
