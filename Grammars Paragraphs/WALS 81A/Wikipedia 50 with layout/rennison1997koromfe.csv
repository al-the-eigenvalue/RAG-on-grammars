"2.1.1.1.5 Word order
Word order is used to distinguish the NP arguments of the verb; in a sim-
ple non-emphasized sentence the subject NP precedes the verb (sole ex-
ception: 2nd person plural imperatives) and the object NPs (direct and
indirect) follow the verb in the order described in § 1.2.1.2.3 above.",[185]

                                                                       Syntax
1.2.1.2.5 Combinations of subject, direct object, indirect object, and other
arguments
Koromfe sentences require a subject, but are quite free in allowing (or
allowing the omission of) all other verb arguments. In example (197)
above we saw that a verb such as 'give' does not require a direct object
even when an indirect object and benefactive are present (unlike English).
I would go as far as to say that any semantically and pragmatically feasible
combination of verb arguments is permissible in Koromfe (pace the
obligatory status of the subject). In example (4) at the beginning of this
chapter, the final word pa 'give' has no overt object of any kind.
     Since the order of the constituents for the combination of verb, sub-
ject, and direct object is given in the relevant sections above, § 1.2.1.2.6 is
omitted.","[105, 106]"
"2.1.1.2.3 Subject ofcopular construction
There is normally no difference between the subject of a copular construc-
tion and that of an intransitive verb (see §2.1.1.2.1 above), with the ex-
ception of the copulas described in the next paragraph. With the copulas la
(positive) or d:J (negative), the relative order of the subject and comple-
ment is quite free when the subject is a personal pronoun, provided that
one of them precedes and the other follows the copula. My informants
claimed that (381) and (382) are equivalent.

        'I am the chief.' (Lit.: 'The chief is me.')
2.1.1.2.4 Direct object
The direct object NP is positioned after the verb, and has no morphologi-
cal inflection. On the relative order of direct and indirect object NPs, see
§ 1.2.1.2.3 above.
     It makes no difference whether the subject is expressed as a free or
bound element, or unexpressed. Therefore §2.1.1.2.4.l-3 are omitted.",[186]

2.1.1.2.5 Indirect object
The indirect object NP is positioned after the verb, and has no morpho-
logical inflection. On the relative order of direct and indirect object NPs,
see § 1.2.1.2.3 above.","[186, 187]"
"1.2.1.1.1.3 The order of the constituents
In a non-topicalized, non-emphatic sentence, the order of constituents is
NP t -copula-NP2, whereby NP t is usually the subject of the copula and NP2
its complement, as shown in (160). However, when the subject is a per-
sonal pronoun, the order of subject and complement can be reversed: (161)
can just as easily be realized as (162 )?O
(160)   m;)        segtA       la     sawadJgJ

        'I am the chief.'(162)   a    jJ          1a     mE
        ART. chief + SG. COPULA PRON. 1SG.
        'I am the chief.' (Lit.: 'The chief is me.')There also exists a special NEGATIVE COPULA, dJ, exemplified in (163),
which behaves syntactically in the same way as its positive counterpart. It
is impossible to use a negative pronoun or the negative particle ba in con-
junction with la; instead, dJ must be used.",[96]
"   Example (378) shows the relative order 'topic NP             wh-word' in
questions, and also the topicalization of a subject NP with a pronoun copy.",[175]
"    As an additional complication, the indirect object of 'give' can option-
ally be expressed with the postposition nt:, here meaning 'for', which is
normally used for the benefactive argument of a verb. Here, the order of
the constituents 'woman' and 'millet' is free: both (195) and (196) are
equally good sentences.

                                Preface
This book is the result of 16 years of work on Koromfe, alongside other
linguistic interests. It would not have been possible without the active and
passive support of several people. I would especially like to thank my
family, who increased during those years from 2 to 5 (other) members, for
their active interest in the early stages and for their patience during the
final stages.
    Annemarie Schweeger-Hefel (t) put her house in Tulfes, Tyrol at my
disposal for my first informant sessions and provided me with background
information on the culture of the Koromba without which I would have
been lost.
    A grammar of this kind is never 'finished', especially for a perfec-
tionist like myself, and writing it has raised many further questions which
I wish I had the time and resources to try to answer. I thank my informants
for their help and Bernard Comrie, the series editor, for his extremely
attentive inspection of the manuscript and suggestions for revisions, which
were always to the point and well-received. Special thanks go to Oskar
Pfeiffer for his diligent proofreading of the manuscript. Of course, the
entire responsibility for what is written here is my own, and I absolve all
others from any part of the blame for the faults that may remain.
    I would welcome feedback from anyone working on related languages

"1.2.5.5 The order o/the head and its modifiers
Only the article a or a possessive adjective, if present, can (and must)
precede the head noun of an NP. Otherwise, the head noun comes first,
followed by all other modifiers in the order described below. This section
refers to simplex NPs only, and not to the 'set-subset' or topicalized
structures mentioned above.
    The universal quantifier duru 'all, every' must always be the last in the
sequence of modifiers of its head noun, even including a relative clause.
The relative order of modifiers which follow the head noun is therefore
that given in (236) and exemplified by the monster NP given in (237),37

i.e.: 'descriptive' adjective(s) - numeral - participial adjective - de-

Syntax1.3 Coordination
Coordination in Koromfe is highly restricted. But-coordination is identical
with and-coordination. Only clauses and NPs can be and-coordinated, and
only clauses can be or-coordinated; modifiers of nouns are juxtaposed,
following the noun which they modify. Other minor types of coordination
occur as described below.
     In place of overt clause coordination or constituent coordination, it is
quite usual in Koromfe to find juxtaposed clauses which repeat all con-
stituents of the first clause except for that element which is to be coordi-
nated (provided that the clause is not too long), often with pronoun re-
placements for NP's. While such repetitious structures can also be found
in most languages, in Koromfe they are the normal case. A particularly
striking example is given in (239) (taken from a religious ceremony).

         'They give health during the day, they give health at midnight, they give health
         at dawn.' (Or: 'They give health during the day, at midnight and at dawn. ')    These basic restrictions on coordination should be borne in mind
throughout the following sub-sections.","[121, 122, 123]"

1.5.2.3 Between superordinate and subordinate clauses
There is no change in the 'NPANTECEDENT - X - pronoun' order when the rela-
tive order of superordinate and subordinate clauses changes, and no other
structures are possible. Therefore §1.5.2.3.1-2 and §1.5.2.4-5 are omitted.",[140]
"1.2.1.1.2.3 The order o/the constituents
The nominal adjectives, being nouns, behave just like other nouns, except
that they are more often found after the copula than before it, and the
'topicalized' word order is the most usual one. The order of constituents is
therefore as described in § 1.2.1.1.1.3 above. Number agreement is
obligatory if the adjective inflects for number. Examples are given in
(173)-{176).

However, the indirect object with ne is not always available for pronoun
objects. A sentence such as (197) cannot mean 'He gives it to him/her',
but can only mean 'He gives it (to someone else) for him/her.' Also, this is
the only possible order of verb arguments, since a true benefactive always
follows both the direct and indirect object.

"    This phenomenon involving k5N is the only case of conjunction-NP
(or relative-NP) inversion that I know of in Koromfe. The relative order of
the clauses is irrelevant. A further example of this inversion is given in
(125). Note the similarity with the topicalized subject in (123), which
seems to be the source of this inversion.
     The relative pronoun may not be within a pre-/postpositional phrase in
the relative clause (e.g. English/or whom or in which). This means that
(114) above is the only way to relativize a benefactive of a verb like 'give'
(which optionally takes the postposition ne).",[83]
"2.1.8.3 The relative order of clitics
There is only one case in which clitics regularly occur adjacent to one
another: in sentences with a direct and indirect object. Both types of object
can be expressed by a suffixal clitic pronoun. In this case, as described and
exemplified in § 1.2.1.2.3 above, the indirect object clitic precedes the
direct object clitic. However, if either of the objects is a full NP, then the
clitic object comes first. Thus the precedence rules for postverbal objects
are:
     1. Clitic pronouns before full NPs, then
     2. Indirect objects before direct objects, provided that 1. is not vio-
        lated.",[351]
"1.2.1.1.3.3 The order a/the constituents
The order of constituents is NP-COPULA-ADVERBIAL, exemplified in (177)-
(181). The adverbial can optionally be emphasized, giving the structure

"1.5.3 Elements located next to complementizers (subordinating
conjunctions)
There are two special effects related to the clause-initial position (which is
the position normally occupied by the subordinating conjunction). The
first is the reversal of the order of the conjunction k5N and a full or inde-
pendent demonstrative subject NP, as described in § 1.1.2.4.2 above, and
the second is that although no subordinating conjunction is present, the
clause-initial position is the only place where the 'special anaphoric' use
of the 2nd person singular pronoun N for a repeated 3rd person subject
occurs (as described in §1.5.2.2 above).",[140]
"1.2.5.3 Combinations o/modifiers
Only adjectives can be combined sequentially, though this is relatively
rare. The order is quite free, since modifiers can be added to the NP as
'afterthoughts'. The unmarked order of adjectives is probably that exem-
plified in (233).

Participial UNMARKED forms of verbs cannot be combined with other par-
ticipial forms, and when combined with other adjectives come last in the
sequence (i.e. even after a numeral), as exemplified in (234), where tam is

'adjectives' are quite impossible. Quantifiers cannot be combined in se-
quence, though they could perhaps be in a 'set-subset' structure exempli-
fied in (231) above.","[120, 121]"
"
1.2.3.3 The relative order of the modifYing and modified adverbials
The modifying adverbial always follows the modified adverbial.",[111]
"2.1.1.1.8 Combinations of the above
The means described above are quite independent of one another, just as
the syntactic and semantic functions which they express are largely in
complementary distribution.
    The class suffixes of both nouns are present in NP+N compounds, but
only the class suffix of the second noun is present in N+N compounds (see
§2.3.1.1 below). However, this still means that the parent NP of such a
compound has a class suffix. Otherwise, noun class suffixes are almost
always present in an NP, and occur independently of prepositions, post-
positions, word order and derivation.",[185]
"2.2.1.2.1 The similarity of the syntax of deverbal nouns to that of
sentences and of non-derived nouns
The syntax of deverbal nouns is entirely (non-derived) noun-like. No de-
verbal noun can take an object or other argument of a verb, or be qualified
by an adverbial which does not also qualify non-derived nouns.
    The most striking example of this behaviour is the regular action noun
derivable from most verb stems by the suffix -am, which I consider to be                                                                                    331
Morphology
the most verb-like of the deverbal nouns. This noun can be combined with
a noun which, in a finite clause, would be its object only by means of an
NP+N genitival compound - in which case the order of the two nouns is
the converse of the verb and its object NP in a finite clause. An example of
each construction type is given in (734)-(735), which are separated by
only one intervening sentence in one of my texts.

Morphology
     The numerals from 1 to 9 have class prefixes (singular nand ga, plu-
ral I). The prefix n does not exist elsewhere, but probably originated as a
class or personal pronoun prefix, since it is dropped when the numeral I is
used attributively (see §2.1.6.2 immediately below). This may be the n
pronoun of the 2nd person singular in a 3rd person usage similar to the
special anaphoric subject usage described in § 1.5.2.2 above.
     The prefix ga- of gad:Jm is the diminutive singular class morpheme
found in the galm noun class and also as a personal pronoun. The prefix I
of the numerals from 2 to 9 is the plural morpheme of the 'non-human'
class gull, which is likewise also used as a personal pronoun. This same
class prefix also seems to occur on the question word Ibl 'how many' -
although of course this cannot be checked because there exist no instances
of a stem bl in isolation or other combination.
     The normal way of counting on one's fingers in Koromfe is to start
with the fingers outstretched and fold the fingers down (often with the
help of the fingers of the other hand), starting from the little finger and
finishing with the thumb. This correlates with the use of the diminutive
class morpheme for 1, but the (non-diminutive) general non-human class
morpheme for 2 to 9.
     The word for 5, In:Jm, has no relation to any word meaning 'hand', but
the presence of a final m is reminiscent of the numeral 1 (which is the only
other numeral with a final m). The word for 6, Ihuru, has no relation to
anything like the concept of 'first finger of the other hand' .
     I know of no reason (other than its mathematical properties) why the
word for lOis the first numeral in ascending order that has no class suffix.
This word is not obviously related to any other concept in the language. Its
striking homophony with the noun class plural suffix -ti, which is still
fully productive in loan word plural formation, is probably accidental.","[334, 335]"
"

                                                                Morphology
    This situation has two interesting consequences:
a) Apart from the phonetic shape of the -hi suffix just mentioned, there
    are no morphemes in Koromfe which have the function of deriving an
    agent or instrument noun from a verb; this is done by the noun class
    suffixes alone.
b) The 'human class' is greatly impoverished if the agent nouns are ex-
    cluded; and those nouns which it does contain are often phonologi-
    cally or morphologically irregular (see the sub-sections of §2.1. 1.9. 1.1
    below).
The individual noun classes are described in the following sub-sections;
note that although most nouns have the 'matching' singular-plural suffix
pair as described below, idiosyncratically some nouns belong to different
classes in singular and plural. (For discussion, see §2.1.1.9.2 below.) Also
a single, very frequent noun in my corpus is irregular: kii1J 'thing', PL.
M6rna. 26
    Apart from the productive plural suffixes -n and -rna, which are used
with loan words, I think that none of the suffixes dealt with below is pro-
ductive. Given that the number of verbs in the language is finite and easily
susceptible to enlargement, even the completely regular formations such
as the agent, instrument and locative suffixes are not, strictly speaking,
productive, even though their structure is perfectly transparent and analys-
able for the speaker/hearer. In the following sub-sections I will therefore
have nothing further to say about the productivity of the suffixes.
    In the following sub-sections, first the four major classes ;)/ba, gul!,
dE/a and gain! are described, which account for well over half the simplex
nouns in my corpus. Then the remaining classes follow in no particular
order.
    ATR vowel harmony is obligatory for all the suffixes described in the
following sub-sections, as it always is within the phonological word.","[241, 242]"
"    It is also possible to coordinate nominal adjectives and participles with
a repeated article a, as in (256). I have found no restriction on the relative
order of the participle and the adjective in either type of coordination.

"
1.1.1.2.2.1.2 Constituents o/subordinate clauses
In subordinate clauses, it is possible, and usual, to question in situ those
words and phrases which in single-clause questions must occur sentence-
initially (see the 'a' examples in (40)-{43) below). However, it is also
possible to move the wh-word or phrase from an embedded non-subject
position to the embedded-clause-initial position (see the 'b' forms of (40)--
(43», or to the matrix-clause-initial position the (the 'c' forms of (40)--
(43» - except for the embedded subject, which can only be questioned in
subordinate-clause-initial position (which is also in situ). In other words,
an embedded subject NP cannot be moved at all. If an ambiguous se-
quence of constituents results from wh-movement, the wh-word is inter-
preted with the matrix, not the embedded sentence, e.g. in (42b).
     Recall that the emphatic particle la, which is found in many of these
examples, is optional in all question-word clauses. However, since it only
occurs in 'clause-second' position, it can never follow an in situ wh-word
that is located to the right of the verb (e.g. an unmoved direct or indirect
object).",[54]
"
                                                                                                   323
Morphology
     Each of the 'derivational' suffixes in (724) is also the noun class suffix
of the derived noun - in other words there are no morphemes which
overtly express the derived morphological category and nothing else. 124
Also, these derivational suffixes, with the exception of the location suffix
-fa all also occur as a) noun class suffixes on underived nouns (cf. the
relevant sub-sections of §2.1.1.9.l above) and b) clitic pronouns. How-
ever, there are some phonological perturbations: -:J (so.) and -ba (PL.) are
the suffixes of the :Jlba basic human class, and ba is the 3rd person plural
human clitic pronoun (prefix and suffix). But there is no pronoun *:J for
the 3rd person singular (where instead the historically unexpected 125 prefix
da and suffix dI are found). go (so.) and I (not he') are the suffix mor-
phemes of the gol! basic non-human noun class and the prefixal forms of
the subject clitic pronouns; but he (corresponding to the derived plural
suffix of the instrument noun) is the suffixal object clitic pronoun form.
Finally, ga is the singular suffix of the diminutive noun class and the 3rd
person diminutive clitic pronoun (prefix and suffix), but the corresponding
plural nI exists only as a noun class suffix and not as a clitic pronoun
(which remains an unfilled gapl26 in the pronoun system).
     Clearly there is a close historical relationship between the non-human
plural suffixes -he and -I, as shown by the fact that both forms occur in the
clitic pronouns; the mid vowel E occurs frequently as the reflex of an ex-
pected high front vowel I in a nasal environment (e.g. as the final harmo-
nized 'epenthetic' vowel of DURATIVE verb forms such as iEJpnE
/fEIJ+d+(r)/). It would seem that he is a phonologically strengthened ver-
sion of the suffix which is required in order to preserve the distinctness of
the agent and pronoun suffix vis-a-vis the DURATIVE verb form (when the
harmonized 'epfmthetic' final vowel would be I).","[358, 359]"

1.1.2.4.2.5 Condition
There is no conditional conjunction in Koromfe corresponding to English
if. Instead, the verbal inflection indicates that the clause is conditional.
The pre-verbal adverb maane, which occurs in some conditional clauses,
cannot be considered to be a conjunction, since a) conjunctions do not
occur in this position (pace the class of temporal adverb clauses described
in §1.1.2.4.2.1, esp. example (125», and b) this word is optional. I there-
fore gloss it as 'only' in example (146). In natural speech, a conditional
clause usually precedes the main clause, but my informants were equally
happy with the reversed order. Examples (149}-{150) below show both
orders.
     It is useful to consider conditional clauses under the sub-headings of
'real' and 'unreal' conditions/ 8 since these have different verbal morphol-
ogy.","[90, 91]"

     Plurals with the suffix -Ii can be formed from any singular noun form, and should
     therefore be treated with caution. There do exist words with a 'real, original' -Ji
     plural noun-class suffix, but these usually have a corresponding -0 singular.

     The meanings 'have plenty, multiply' are due to accidental homophony.

     The kind of 'fog' which exists in the Koromba area consists of wind-borne sand
     which obscures vision; 'fog' consisting of particles of water does not exist.

     Temperatures below freezing point are virtually unknown (at least in practice) to
     the Koromba; only the word 'hail' exists.
33
     The word w5eie 'blade of grass' is used to denote 'snake' in order to avoid bad
     luck by mentioning the snake's true name d01Jfe, PL. domi. This choice of euphe-
     mism stems from the long, thin shape shared by both.
34
     The verb dollotMn is the reversive of dollMn 'put', and therefore it primarily de-
     notes the undoing of a (previous) placing of something.

     The word na1JW is probably a compound whose first part is the deictic stem na1J
     and whose second part is a shortened form of the word kana given here; however,
     it is the more frequently used term.
36
     Since I have never experienced it in Africa, I am not sure whether this word really
     denotes 'hail' in the proper sense, or whether (like the French word brouillard for
      'fog') it has been taken over to denote some other form of precipitation.
37
     This word is probably a petrified and phonologically eroded version of ba jaa, i.e.

40
     The word fei is probably a participially used UNMARKED form of the verb felei
     given in this table. However, it is not used as a verb form - probably because the
     basic meaning of this verb, 'live', is viewed as a continuous action which is com-
     patible only with aspects expressed by the DURATIVE and PROGRESSIVE inflection.

2.1.1.9.2.7 The m singular class
The nouns in this class are uncountable (and therefore have no plural).662.1.1.9.2.8 The fell singulativelcollective class
As its label 'singulative/collective' suggests, this class denotes nouns
which can be viewed as (small) individual members which make up a
mass-like group that is not easily countable. Some typical nouns of this
kind are the insects: 'ant, bee, fly, grasshopper, mosquito', the herd ani-
mals: 'cattle, fish' (though most herd animals are in other noun classes),
the things which grow in almost uncountable masses: 'bushes, creeping
plant, fruits (of various kinds), grass (of various kinds), hair, rice, toma-
toes', and arguably also 'chain',67 'coin', 'pearl', 'star'. Some words have
no collective form because these are either semantically inappropriate (e.g.
'one' and names of languages) or are expressed by other nouns (e.g.
'finger').
    Nevertheless, there remain a few puzzling words: the animals 'parrot,
snake', which are not particularly herd-oriented, the long-thin objects 'rib,
stake' (which might form a semantic sub-group together with the equally
long-thin types of grass, and with 'snake', for which the secret word is
'(blade of) grass'), and the sexual organs 'testicle, vagina' .682.1.1.9.3 Noun class marking on words other than nouns and nominal
adjectives
The noun classes are marked on the noun, are similar to the 3rd person
pronouns, and are also marked on some deictic adjectives and also argua-
bly on numerals. These aspects of the noun class system are dealt with in
their respective sections of this chapter.
    Noun classes are not marked on verbs, although the 3rd person short
pronouns resemble the human, non-human and diminutive class suffixes,
both in subject (=preverbal) and object (=postverbal) position. However,
these morphemes are clearly pronouns rather than noun class agreement
markers, since they do not appear when there is an overt subject or object
noun phrase.","[267, 268]"

cause it does not inflect for number and humanness, is homophonous (and
probably syntactically identical) with the temporal conjunction k5N de-
scribed in § 1.1.2.4.2.1 below. When it is not the subject of the relative
clause, it almost always inverts with a full NP subject of the relative
clause, optionally with a disjunctive (free) pronoun subject, but only rarely
with a clitic pronoun subject. An example of inversion with a full NP is
given in (116), and an example of optional inversion and non-inversion
with a disjunctive pronoun in (117), which is drawn from spontaneous but
formal speech. The first version of the headless relative clause, k5 mab

"2.1.1.9.1.4 The 'diminutive' class ga/m
This noun class is something of a mixture because on the one hand a
DIMINUTIVE can be formed from many nouns which are in other classes, in
order to denote a smaller variety of that noun; such diminutives often do
not have a diminutive plural, but take the plural of the 'full sized' noun.
But there also exist many nouns in this class which have no related noun
in any other class. Even so, the nouns in this class tend to denote smaller-
than-usual things. Note that the noun class with the same suffix -ga in
Moore has no diminutive connotation.",[257]
"1.1.1.2.2.1.1 Constituents of the main clause
Any NP or PP of a main clause can be questioned. The verb or VP can
only be questioned indirectly (see (39) below). Adverbial questions are
restricted to 'where', 'when' and 'how', plus the questioning of the post-
position in a PP. Other adverbial questions such as 'why' involve ques-
tioned NPs.
    The following examples show the questioning of a whole noun-phrase
as subject (31), direct object (32)-(33) and indirect object (34).",[52]
"2.1.1.9.2.1.2 The J/ba class, sub-type singular [a] and plural [ama]/
[amma]
This small sub-class contains mainly kinship terms (mother, father, grand-
parent), including terms of kinship by marriage and even the 'pre-kinship'
term kusa 'fianceee)'. Note, however, that apart from their relative short-
ness, there is no easy way of delimiting these kinship terms by structural
criteria from some of the loan words which take the plural suffix -rna and,
by lexical accident, also have a singular form ending in a, such as
miiakcsa, PL. miiakcsama 'match'.
    It is interesting to observe which kinship nouns are excluded from this
sub-class: As mentioned in §2.1.1.9.2.1.1 immediately above, there is a
special word for 'husband', bara but none for 'wife' (for which kE5, the
word for 'woman' is used). The word 'grandparent' is included, but
'grandchild' is not; it is in the diminutive class. Glosses of most of the
words in this class were given in §2.1. 1.9. 1.1.2 (531) above.
     The word saa, PL. sammii 'owner', the only non-kinship word in this
sub-class, probably derives historically from sa, PL. sammii 'father' .612.1.1.9.2.2 The 'basic non-human' class gO/r60

denote some characteristic of the referent which is considered non-human,
e.g. zaku, PL. zapa 'silly person' (with a -ba plural ofthe human class).
     With one exception, there are no differences between the semantic
characteristics of each morphophonological sub-class; they are therefore
not dealt with separately here. That exception is the plural sub-class in -fa
(-Ta) , which is typically used for adjectives (a grammatical rather than
semantic characteristic).

glosses (of words whose singular and plural are regular) is listed in (556).

    The most frequently used nouns in this class are the instrument nouns
derived from verbs and ordinal numerals, even when they refer to hu-
mans. 63 The ordinal numerals have the same -hT plural form as the dever-
bal instrument nouns. Recall that the non-human 3rd person pronoun, both
singular and plural, is homophonous with this class suffix, even when the
noun to which it refers is in a different class; conversely, no non-human
pronoun (apart form the diminutive singular -ga) is homophonous with
any other noun class. 642.1.1.9.2.3 The dEja class

noun. Moreover, the translation with a single verb (or copula + adjective)
suggests that we have a single compound verb here. As a third factor, the

"1.2.1.3.2 The positional possibilities for adverbials within the sentence
1.2.1.3.2.1 Adverbs
Adverbs fall into three distinct classes on distributional grounds, and each
class has related semantic characteristics. (Note that clause-final in the
following sub-sections excludes the sentence-final yes-no question parti-
cles, which are always the very last thing in a sentence.)1.2.1.3.2.1.1 Pre-verbal verbal adverbs
This class of adverbs includes the adverbs da 'in the past', handa 'truly' ,28
and occurs before the (first) finite verb of a clause (with the exception of
handa when used as an exclamation outside normal sentence structure -
cf. the pre-sentential echo-question usage of handa in § 1.1.1.2.3.3 above).
This is also the position where the negative particle ba occurs when it
qualifies the verb. In the rare event that more than one of these co-occur,
they have the order handa - da - ba.
Sentence (201) below contains an example of da. The adverb handa is
exemplified in (200).
(200)    d;}                handa we d;}              we
         PRON. 3SG. HUM.    really be PRON. 3SG. HUM. be
         'He really existed, he existed!'",[107]
"    The temporal clause construction is often replaced by the conditional
adverb clause, as in (126), or a coordinate main clause, as in (127)-(129),
particularly when the tense changes. Sentence (126) shows what in other
languages is a 'future perfect' tense relationship, with the verb 'come'
used as an auxiliary. The choice of the past tense for 'come' is dictated by
the conditional construction (see §1.1.2.4.2.5 below). Sentences (127}-
(128) show the use of a coordinate main clause when the durative or itera-
tive aspect is involved ('w4ile'); here the relative order of the clauses has
no semantic effect, but the PROGRESSIVE has to be expressed on the verb of
the first coordinated clause, and the second verb defaults to DURATIVE.

        'He spoke while he was eating.' (Lit.: 'He was speaking and he was eating.')    The use of the PROGRESSIVE aspect in (127)-(128) deserves further
comment, since it shows that the temporal usage of this inflectional form
for 'present and/or future', although statistically the most common, is only
secondary.13 Sentence (129) shows that the adverb da can be used for
clarification.",[86]

2.1.1.2 The expression ofsyntactic functions in finite clauses
2.1.1.2.1 Subject ofan intransitive verb
The subject NP is positioned before the verb. There is no morphological
inflection. Some of the proclitic subject pronouns have a phonologically
weaker vowel than the postclitic object pronouns, but this is a purely pho-
nological matter and never distinctive (and therefore never inflectional).
    There is no distinction of 'agent', therefore §2. 1. 1.2. 1.1-2 are omitted.","[185, 186]"

"2.1.3.1.1.1 Personal passive
2.1.3.1.1.1.1 Direct object of the active as the subject of the passive
In this type of 'passive' there is no change in the morphology. The direct
object moves from the (postverbal) object position to the (preverbal) sub-
ject position. Sentence (619) is the passive version of sentence (618). It is
not possible to express the agent NP within a passive sentence.

2.1.3.1.1.1.2 Indirect object of the active as subject of the passive
I have been unable to elicit such a construction because there always
seems to be a verb with the right semantics to make an indirect-object
passive avoidable (e.g. 'he received X' instead of 'he was given X').
    No other constituent of the active appears as subject of the passive,
there is no impersonal passive, and the subject of the active sentence can
never be expressed in a sentence with a passive reading, therefore
§2.1.3.1.1.1.3 and §2.1.3.1.1.2-3 are omitted.",[302]
"2.1.2 Pronouns
2.1.2.1 Personal pronouns
2.1.2.1.1 Free (disjunctive) pronouns
There exists a set of free pronouns, which, generally speaking, can be used
in all syntactic positions in which any other noun phrase or clitic pronoun
can be used. There are also clitic pronouns (see §2.1.2.1.10 below). The
free pronouns (which I call 'DISJUNCTIVE PRONOUNS', abbreviated DISJ.
PRON. in glosses) have the same phonetic shape when used as subject,
direct object, indirect object or anything else. Formally, they are composed
of the clitic pronoun (as a prefix) followed by a stem b, which does not
occur as an independent noun in Koromfe. 73 Their forms are given in
(565).

Morphology
2.1.2.1.1.1 Obligatory use offree pronouns
There is no case in which a free pronoun must obligatorily be used within
the basic elause structure involving a subject NP, verb and object NPs. In
cases where one of these NP is required for syntactic well-formedness
(e.g. as the subject of a sentence) a elitic pronoun can just as easily be
used.
     When a pronoun is emphasized or topicalized (cf. § 1.11 and § 1.12
above respectively), only the free form and not the elitic can be used. In a
nutshell: a elitic pronoun can always be used when it has something to
eliticize to (i.e. a verb for the postclitics and a noun, verb or postposition
for the proclitics); otherwise a free pronoun must be used.
     This holds for first, second and all types of third person (i.e.
§2.1.2.1.1.1.1-3, which are therefore omitted).","[272, 273]"

     Some of these words are similar to Moore words with a -gu singular; they may
     therefore once have had a g which has been lost historically.
60
     In Rennison (1986c) I give a more detailed account (with plentiful examples) of
     the semantic characteristics of the 'human class' and the 'basic non-human class'.
61
     The word saandre 'fatherhood', with a long aa, also seems to support this analysis,
     and to indicate that the word 'father' itself was probably once saa, with a long
     vowel, rather than present-day sa.
62
     The notations '(2x)', '(3x)' etc. mean that the same gloss appears twice (3 times,
     etc.) for different Koromfe words.
63
     This seems to be a very recent development; one of the texts in my collection
     contains ordinal numbers with the human singular suffix -;). Compare §2.1.6.4 be-
     low on the formation of the ordinal numerals.
64
     The origin of the human 380. pronoun d<J/dI is unknown, but cannot in my opinion
     be the de of the de/a noun class. Cf. the description of the personal pronouns in
     §2.1.2.1.
6S
     Because of the small number of its members, nothing conclusive can be said about
     the sub-type singular [lalJa] and plural [lao].
66
     Apart from the ubiquitous -fj suffix which can be added to virtually any singular.
67
     The word for 'chain', kerfe, is homophonous with the word for 'parrot'. My infor-
     mants claim that his is purely accidental, and that there is no semantic link between
     the two meanings.
68
     One informant suggested that the collective is used for these sexual organs in order
     to suggest ignorance of the precise details (which would be construed as polite and
     respectful).
69
     I was unable to elicit a long form from my informants, and none exists in my
     Koromfe texts. However, I would not be at all surprised if a long diminutive sin-
     gular form such as ke1Jge did exist.
70
     Here the word kalm5 'old' (used only for humans) is used in the sense of
     'deserving respect'. Note that it too has no determiner, and is therefore indefinite.
71
     Apart from the subject NP, this is virtually a repetition of the second part of (561)
     above; it is taken from the same text.
72
     This 2nd person singular pronoun is used as a 'special anaphoric' pronoun for the
     repeated 3rd person subject (cf. §1.5.2.2 above).
73
     This 'dummy' stem b is phonetically similar to the adverb b which means 'in any
     case'. However, it would be difficult to claim that the two are identical, since they
     can co-occur, as in m<Jb b 'I, in any case' or 'as far as I'm concerned'.
74
     The postclitic variants of the clitic pronouns must have a full vowel if phrase final;
     the proclitic variants, on the other hand, never need a full vowel for phonological
     reasons (though they may have one lexically, e.g. gu).
7S
     The free form is included here only for completeness' sake. It always consists of
     the prefixal form plus the 'dummy' stem b.
76
      On this point I have relied entirely on my informants' judgements, which is sup-
     ported by the sparse cases of plurals in my texts. Prost (1980) reports the same us-
      age, plus, he claims, the occasional use of the non-human singular gu referring to
      'God'; this my informants categorically denied. However, this whole area is clearly
      one in which further data from normal everyday speech would be of great benefit.","[401, 402]"
"                                                                                            469
Phonology106
      This means that, conversely, there are no GERUND forms with the suffix -am that
      have a long high vowel.
107
      In extremely careful speech my informants 'reversed' this coalescence for me,
      giving for example [fuAm] for normal [foom]. However, such realizations never
      occur in any of my recorded texts or spontaneous speech of my informants. I there-
      fore conclude that they are an artefact of my investigation and do not exist at all in
      normal speech. The same probably applies to the glided versions of the diphthongs.
108
      Not all logically possible combinations oflexical vowels actually occur in CV verb
      stems (e.g. /Co+amJ ~ [Coom] and some nasal vowels), but this is probably acci-
      dental, and I expect that some of the expected forms may turn up on further inves-
      tigation of the language. However, the lack of nasal high vowels may be system-
      atic, since nasal vowels generally have a tendency to lower to mid (cf. §3.4.1.1.1.1
      on that process).
109
      The diphthong variants of the PAST forms occur only in very careful speech and are
      extremely short, apart from fj££] and nee]. The extremely careful forms fj£j£] and
      nEje] were probably only given for the sake of the investigator, and do not occur in
      natural speech.
110
      Here, vowel-final means that the last vowel of the word must be lexically present
      in whatever morpheme happens to be at the end of that word. In other words, the
      lexical vowel of a suffix is just as good as the lexical vowel of a bare word stem.
111
      Since this word is ATR-disharmonic, its initial a is probably in fact the article a.
112
      Deletion cannot, of course, get rid of the nucleus position within syllable structure
      which was occupied by the vowel: and so, by the general process mentioned in
      §3.2.5, the deletion site is optionally realized as phonetic schwa, as in the example
      [per:Jy:J sam] given here.
113
      The tonology of Moore compound nouns is highly complex and variations in the
      tone marks on these words would only be confusing. The phonetic transcription
      used here is the standard system set down by Nikiema (1980b); phonologically, the
      vowels transcribed here as [0] are lax [ors (cf. Rennison, 1987c).
114
      For Koromfe this is true; for Moore the processes of U-umlaut and A-umlaut
      (which have no equivalent in Koromfe) ensure that the quality of the lost vowels
      can be reconstructed from the first stem vowel by 'spreading' their quality to the
       left. For details, see Rennison (1987c).
115
      The star of [dayalr] refers to its impossibility as an UNMARKED form of this verb;
      this phonetic form is the realization of its DURATIVE.
116
       In contrast with the other alternative forms given here, UNMARKED fja] and fjao]
      are equally common. Moreover, in stories they can often be found together, always
       in the order fjao]-fja], in a sequence of short pronoun-verb clauses like da jao da ja
       'He went.' or 'He left.'
117
       Strictly speaking, the stem of the word [m:>s:JIja] does contain a possible source of
       nasality in its first consonant; however, this would be the only word with onset-to-
       onset nasalization which skipped an unnasalizable onset.","[504, 505]"

"Koromfe
Strong linguistic and ecological pressures are gradually pushing Koromfe,
a local language spoken in the north of Burkina Faso, West Africa, towards
extinction. Spoken by, at the most, 10,000 people, Koromfe has defied
political and cultural domination by other local languages.
   Few other researchers have studied Koromfe in such depth and this is the
first detailed linguistical analysis of its kind, consequently providing data
which sheds light on many previously unanswered questions concerning both
Koromfe and genetic and general linguistic issues. The information which
constitutes this De.scriptive Grammar is based on field work conducted by the
author. As a Gur or Voltaic language, the author shows how Koromfe shares
many phonological, lexical, morphologi<;al and syntactic affinities with other
such languages.
John R. Rennison is currently Senior Lecturer in Linguistics at the Univer-
sity of Vienna. He has worked extensively on the theory of phonology and
morphology, and has worked on Koromfe for sixteen years.

Editorial statement
Until quite recently, work on theoretical linguistics and work on language
description proceeded almost entirely in isolation from one another. Work on
theoretical linguistics, especially in syntax, concentrated primarily on
English, and its results were felt to be inapplicable to those interested in
describing other languages. Work on describing individual languages was
almost deliberately isolationist, with the development of a different frame-
work and terminology for each language
                                  lang~age or language group, and no feeding
of the achievements of language description into linguistic theory. Within the
last few years, however, a major rapprochement has taken place between
theoretical and descriptive linguistics. In particular, the rise of language
typology and the study of language universals have produced a large number
of theoreticians who require accurate, well-formulated descriptive data from
a wide range of languages, and have shown descriptive linguists that they can
both derive benefit from and contribute to the development of linguistic
theory. Even within generative syntax, long the bastion of linguistic anglo-
centrism, there is an increased interest in the relation between syntactic
theory and a wide range of language types.
   For a really fruitful interaction between theoretical and descriptive lin-
guistics, it is essential that descriptions of different languages should be
comparable. The Questionnaire of the present series (originally published as
Lingua, vol. 42 (1977), no. 1) provides a framework for the description of a
language that is (a) sufficiently comprehensive to cover the major structures
of any language that are likely to be of theoretical interest; (b) sufficiently
explicit to make cross-language comparisons a feasible undertaking (in
particular, through the detailed numbering key); and (c) sufficiently flexible
to encompass the range of variety that is found in human language. The
volumes that were published in the predecessor to the present series, the
Lingua Descriptive Studies (now available from Routledge), succeeded in
bridging the gap between theory and description: authors include both
theoreticians who are also interested in description and field workers with an
interest in theory.
Editorial statement  The aim of the Descriptive Grammars is thus to provide descriptions of a
wide range of languages according to the format set out in the Questionnaire.
Each language will be covered in a single volume. The first priority of the
series is grammars of languages for which detailed descriptions are not at
present available. However, the series will also encompass descriptions of
better-known languages with the series framework providing more detailed
descriptions of such languages than are currently available (as with the
monographs on West Greenlandic and Kannada).

    Schweeger-Hefel & Mukarovsky (1961) is a first tentative analysis of
the phonology and morphology of the language. Schweeger-Hefel &
Staude (1972) is an ethnological study which includes a vocabulary
(without details of the system of transcription used) but no other linguisti-
cally relevant information. Prost (1980) is a grammatical sketch of the
language, including a few translated texts. It is difficult to use because the
transcription is unreliable. None of these researchers discovered (or was
prepared to accept) the great variety of phonetic vowels that exist. Never-
theless, both Schweeger-Hefel & Staude (1972) and Prost (1980) are in-
terpretable to a large extent, and contribute to the general picture of the
language.
    My own research directly relating to Koromfe has been published in
the form of a Koromfe-French dictionary (Rennison, 1986a) and a collec-
tion of texts translated into French (Rennison, 1986b). The inflectional
categories in the verbs have been revised in the present monograph due to
later research on tense and aspect, and a few minor phonetic details in the
dictionary are not quite accurate. 2 Koromfe has also been the object of
some of my more theoretical linguistic (particularly phonological) re-
search; the relevant articles are given in the bibliography.
    One point on which all researchers agree is that Koromfe has no tones,
even though by rights it should have. This point is brought home by the
anecdote about a whistling bird (A. Schweeger-Hefel, p.c.) who, the in-
formant said, whistled a sentence in MoonS. When asked what the bird was
whistling in Koromfe, he replied: 'Nothing.'","[37, 38]"

             but not: 'When did he see it?')    The questioning of the first (i.e. embedded) NP of a compound
(NP+N) NP in example (43) requires a pronoun in the subordinate clause
position when the wh-word is matrix-sentence-initial (in (43b», but not
when it remains in situ within the subordinate clause (in (43a». For clarity,
the full structure of (43a) is given in (44). In (43b) it is the encircled NP of
(44) which is moved to matrix-clause-initial position and replaced with the
pronoun gu; the emphatic particle La is omitted to preserve the reading of
the sentence (although it would still be structurally permissible, but would
be taken to modify Lebttm in the changed structure).

               'What did he say is difficult to build?' (Wh-word in situ.)     The element which normally appears in the position next to a subordi-
nating conjunction is the subject of the subordinate clause, since most
subordinating conjunctions are located at the beginning of the subordinate
clause. There is no restriction on the in situ questioning of this element (cf.
(43a)), but when it is questioned in main-clause-initial position, a pronoun
copy must occupy its 'original' position in the subordinate clause (cf.
(43b )). There are also pragmatically/semantically non-preferred constella-
tions of pronouns, probably due to ambiguity of reference.
     With the subordinating conjunction k5N,4 on the other hand, only in
situ questioning is allowed. This conjunction is located between the sub-
ject NP and the finite verb of the subordinate clause (when the subject NP
is not a pronoun), and so the in situ question structure happens to have the
questioned element in main-clause-initial position when the order of
clauses is 'subordinate - main'. In other words, (45c) derives from (45a)
but not from (45b). A sentence such as *ala 0 kure (a) dIU k5m bene Ie
derived from (45b) is quite impossible, as is any other question involving
movement of the questioned element out of the k5N-clause to main-clause-
initial position.","[55, 56, 57]"

The basic vowel system of Koromfe, disregarding diphthongs, has 5 full
vowels, as given in (790), plus a weak mid central vowel schwa [g]. Each
of the 5 full vowels has a counterpart with ATR, and each of these 10
vowels can be nasal or oral, giving 20 short monophthongs. Finally, all
vowels (except for the accidental gap [6:]) can be long, giving 39 full
vowels (and with schwa a total inventory of 40 vowels). The full system is
given in (791).
