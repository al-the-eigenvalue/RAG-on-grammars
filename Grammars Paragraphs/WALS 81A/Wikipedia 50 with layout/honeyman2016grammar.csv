taking predicate (§12.2.2).
       Most lexemes have low semantic density. In terms of exponence, typically
only one or two categories are encoded in a single morpheme. Subject or
object are always combined with number. The multipart progressive (§7.4.2)
includes a deictic distinction in the realis form (§7.4.2). As part of the
progressive, and other constructions, nominalisation and subject marking
are fused into portmanteau morphs (§16.5.1.1). On nominals, the genitive is
combined with number (4.8.5).
       Like many non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea, the basic word
order of a simple clause in Momu is S(O)V (Dryer, 2007b, 2011) or simply
verb-final (Foley, 1986, p10). In Momu, all participants in a clause typically
occur before the verb and observe a fixed ordering (§8.1.3).35 Nominal heads
are post-modified (§5.1) excepting nouns modifying other nouns (§14.1.2),
adpositions are postpositive (§3.5.1, §9.1) and relational and adnominal case
marking is post-positive, upon dependents (§4.8.1). This is in line with
the general expectation for S(O)V languages. Possession is variably marked
(§4.8.5): small closed nominal classes include genitive- (pronouns, §3.5.2) or
possessive-marking (possessed kin, §4.6.2). Genitive phrases can freely occur
before or after the head that they modify (§4.8.5.2). Inalienable possession
(relating to body parts and houses) can be unmarked (§14.1.2.4), and is often
externally possessed (§10.2.1).
       In “tight” verb or verb phrase coordination (i.e., serial verb constructions,
§13), the final verb is usually the prominent host of inflectional categories.
In looser coordinative structures, each predicating verb may host inflectional
categories. Manner is most commonly indicated by serial verbs (§13.2.1), but
small sets of adverbial forms also occur in a similar (preverbal) position in
the clause (§9.4, §9.3.1, §9.3.1).
       All adverbial subordinators occur on the right edge of the clause (§15),
some both pre-modify and post-modify main clauses (often with a diﬀer-
ence in meaning), while others are fixed on one or the other order. Nominal
modifying subordinate clauses occur in the same position as other lexical
modifiers, after the head (§15.1, §15.8). Complementisers also occur after
the dependent clause (§16.2). Depending on the complement-taking predic-
  35
    Verb-final order is not strictly so, like in languages like Ku Waru (Merlan and Rumsey,
1991). There is a (seemingly increasingly common) pattern of postposing a single non-
subject participant after the verb which should not be considered topical afterthought
(§8.1.3). Certainly though, the dominant word order is clearly S(O)V.","[55, 56]"

       pn     n       adj     vt
      ‘Slupi got a big stone’Similarly case marking with the comitative =b combines with word order to
indicate a coordinated subject (§4.8.3.1, §14.2.2), or instrumental obliques
(§4.8.3.2).17 The focus marker =ne (§4.8.9) indicates that an argument is
extra-clausal (contrastively focussed).
 17
    Comitative-marking does not occur with objects (§8.2.2). Additionally, comitative-
marking occurs on temporal adverbials (§4.8.3.3).",[128]
"4.8.2         Oblique =m
Any or all object and oblique arguments can be marked by the oblique.
The marking indicates that the NP functions as a non-subject argument.
Oblique-marking may be required, optional, or impossible according to the
situation. A combination of word order, oblique-marking and predicate type
is used to define both objects (§8.2.2) and obliques (§8.2.3). Adjuncts cannot
be marked oblique.28 The oblique can also mark sentential complements to
a variety of complement-taking predicates (§16).
       A secondary function of the oblique by way of its optionality is as a
marker of new information. Non-subject arguments in a clause that are
clearly active in the discourse are often expressed by zero anaphora. Refer-
ents whose role in the clause is understood from context may be expressed
by an NP, unmarked for the oblique, as a case of topical reactivation (Lam-
brecht, 1996). Referents new to the discourse or unrecoverable from context,
or those for whom the speaker deems to be of an unclear role must be marked
oblique.
       So, for instance, both the question word and the answer that fills the
same slot in a question-answer pair in (4.18) are necessarily marked with
the oblique. In the question and answer, oblique-marking is required. The
constituent question form is, by definition, a request for an unknown referent.
The response is a new referent (or role for that referent) to the hearer.
Admittedly, this could also be driven by dialogic parallelism that creates the
expectation that the response form should structurally mirror the question
(Evans, 2012).

is fused into the form of the adverb.",[168]

10.1.1       Monovalent clauses
Nearly all intransitive predicates have a subject and a predicate. Subjects
do not take oblique marking, and they occur clause-initially (§8.2.1).
       Non-verbally predicated clauses include proper-inclusion (§11.2.1), simil-
arity (§11.2.2), attribution (§11.3, §11.5), possession (§11.4, §11.5), location
(§11.6), and some further minor types (§11.7, §11.8). Amongst these predic-
ates are single lexical items, phrases, and predicates that include predicate
complements. Further details are given in §11, including a consideration
of the non-verbal and verbal coding of some semantic types of predicate in
§11.12. Otherwise, this section is mainly concerned with verbal predication.
       Some basic monovalent clauses are given in (10.1). Note that the state
(§7.5.1.1) and achievement (§7.5.1.3) verbs in (a) and (b) are fixed on a third
person singular subject form of the verb, but the nominal can be plural. A
subset of state (§7.5.1.1) and achievement/accomplishment (§7.5.1.3) verbs
have this restriction in subject marking (§3.1.1.2, §3.1.1.3, §8.2.1). Subjects
are otherwise also cross-referenced on the verb. (c) is an example of a mono-
valent activity verb (with subject marking).(10.1) (a) Kwo su.
           fire be.alight\3sgS
          ‘The fire was/is alight.’
         (b) Kwo fuku      kaanu.
             tree branch broke\3sgS
             ‘The branch broke / is broken.’
         (c) Te kiy.
             1sg consume[1sgS]
             ‘I ate.’10.1.2       Bivalent clauses
Bivalent clauses always include a subject, a second argument and a predicate,
in that order. The second argument can be an object with a transitive
predicate or an oblique with an intransitive predicate. Also possible are
some predicates which take predicate complements.2 The negative possessive
   2
    Predicates that take predicate complements include: the similarity predicate sukw
‘be similar to’ (§11.2.2), or its inchoative verbal form sukta, and copulative uses of the
existential verbs ai ‘be (animate)’ and wu ‘be (inanimate).’ For these predicates, the
predicate complement cannot be expressed by zero anaphora. Note also that the copulas
                                          328
predicate momu (§11.10) is the only non-verbal transitive predicate. The
remaining predicates are verbs, which is the focus of this section.
    Some basic examples of intransitive bivalent clauses are given in (10.2).
All include subjects (8.2.1), obliques (§8.2.3) and verbal predicates, in that
order. Obliques are marked by either the oblique (a), directional (b), or
comitative relational cases (c), or by spatial postpositions (d).(10.2) (a) Ay Vanimo=m        pin.
           2sg Vanimo=obl one.goes[1|3sgS]
          ‘You went to Vanimo.’
      (b) Wasi    fiky=ti      y-o-wo.
          pawpaw house=dir d-[impf]inan:be.at-3sgS:nzr
          ‘The pawpaw is at/towards the house.’
      (c) Wo uikeno=b       ta.
          3sg joint=com do\3sgS
          ‘He walked on his knees.’
      (d) Te wune niny oton.
          1sg rock above one.sits[1|3sgS]
          ‘I sat on the stone.’Some basic examples of bivalent clauses with transitive predicates are given
in (10.3). These clauses all include a subject, oblique-marked object, and a
verb, in that order. Mono-transitive verbs in Momu diﬀer between (a) no
overt marking of objects, (b) stem alternation coding verbal number (§6.6),
and (c) object cross-referencing (§6.2.2). Note also that the oblique case is
used for both objects and obliques.(10.3) (a) Flerwick ie=m       kuw.
           Flerwick fish=obl consume\3sgS
          ‘Flerwick ate fish.’
      (b) Te yeswo=m niy.
          1sg pig=obl shoot.one[1sgS]
          ‘I shot a pig.’

3.1       Verbs
Predicate heads to a clause in Momu can be either verbal (§10) or non-verbal
(§11). These predicates license one, two or three arguments.1 As the clausal
head, the “neutral” word order typically places the head in the clause-final
position, setting aside factors like discourse pragmatic restructuring of a
clause (Dryer, 2007b).
      Verbs are the major host of morphology in Momu and are primarily
identified by their ability to inflect for a range of categories including subject
  1
      In considering grammatical relations, predicates are treated in a unified matter (§8).",[117]

                                     177
   The possible strategies for possession include genitive NPs (§4.8.5.1), gen-
itive pronouns (§4.1.2) and possessed kin compounds (§14.1.2.5). There are
additionally possessive-attributive strategies which code possession-like rela-
tionships including proprietive NPs (§4.8.6), body part (or house) possessive
compounds (§14.1.2.4) and whole-part compounds (§14.1.2.2).
   The relative order of possessor and possessed elements, the host of mark-
ing, and the intended referent of the construction are all plotted in Tables 5.4,
5.5, and 5.6.
   First, considering the order of possessed and possessor elements, there is
a basic split between possessed-possessor and possessor-possessed strategies,
shown in Table 5.4. This split is represented on both sides by genitive NPs
in that either order is available (§4.8.5.2).","[205, 206]"
"2.5.1.1      GC metathesisThe general preference in Momu is for CG ordering over GC in both onsets
and word-finally (§2.3, §2.4). Where a verb root ends in a glide, the addition
of a subject marker triggers metathesis of root-final glide and inflection-
initial consonant. GC metatheses on morphological boundaries are found in
languages such as Yagua and Zoque, where they are similarly motivated by
phonotactic or timing preference resolutions to morphology (Hume, 2002;
Semiloﬀ-Zelasko, 1973).
       In (2.57), the addition of a single-consonant inflectional morph triggers
metathesis of the final glide on the verb root. In these examples, the root
ends with a CG sequence, and the addition of a C triggers the G to move to
the right edge.(2.57) (a) taty ‘shoot many’ + -f ‘2sgS’→ tatfy
         (b) woky ‘go down’ + -r ‘1plS’ → wokry
         (c) wory ‘come down’ + -m ‘2plS’ → wormyIf the inflection is of the form CV(V), epenthesis is less common but still pos-
sible between consonants in C1 C2 G sequences created by metathesis. Given
the vowel nucleus in the inflection, syllabification of C2 will not happen in
this scenario. In (2.58a) (and (2.60b) below) the metathesised glide creates
a heavy syllable. Note also that in (2.58a), metathesis brings about the
sequence tr not otherwise found in mono-morphemic words.55
  55
    Considering other possible CG-final verb roots, the complex onsets kry, nry [n.drj]
and fry all become possible word-medially.",[102]
"
                                             59
GC sequences are not possible word-medially in mono-morphemic forms.
Compounding (§14.1) makes these possible, however. For instance the nom-
inal compound koyfi ‘tears’ comes from koy + fyi ‘eye + water’, and this
compounding creates and preserves a GC ordering word-medially.34
       Excluding glides, just about all CC clusters are attested word-medially.
Table 2.25 plots attested values. Where I have found no mono-morphemic
forms, the combination is given in parentheses.","[87, 88]"

5.1.5    Genitive determiners
Genitive pronouns (§4.1.2) and genitive-comitative pronouns (§4.1.3) can
modify a head noun, marking it as possessed.
   (5.15) gives examples of genitive pronouns modifying nouns. In (a) it is
an improper kin noun, in (b) an abstract noun, in (c) a body part and in (d)
a location. Although some possessive constructions are restricted to certain
nominal word classes, genitive pronouns can modify all nominals (§5.6).

   A genitive pronoun in the determiner position can be preceded by other
modifiers. A numeral precedes the genitive pronoun in (5.16a), and in (b)
it is preceded by an adjective. In (c) it is preceded by a representative
coordinator (§14.2.3), here functioning like a quantifier.

5.2       Modifier-nominal headed phrases
Momu is a language where nominal modifiers can head a noun phrase. The
order of elements is mostly the same as that defined in the basic noun phrase
template (§5.1) but the further to the right that the modifier occurs in the
template, the fewer the modifying possibilities. Phrase structure rules ex-
pressing modifier-nominal headed NPs are given in (5.17). Note in particular
that in noun-headed phrases the order of numerals and quantifiers is strict,
but for NPs headed by numerals or quantifiers, each can modify the other.","[189, 190, 191]"

glides. Mid-high vowels are pulled higher by a neighbouring glide (§2.1.4.2),
resulting in a diphthong or phonetic long high vowel. There are no non-
complex high vowels in Momu.
       The glides are fragile. In the absence of an adjacent vowel, they are either
devoiced or deleted. Glides aﬀect the surface realisation of both consonants
and vowels (§2.1.3) by palatalising or labialising consonants and raising or
rounding vowels. Glides occupy a special position in the phonotactics of
Momu as well. The ideal basic syllable (§2.4) has a preferred linear order-
ing of consonant-glide-vowel. In some combinations of morphology where a
final glide meets an initial consonant, this preference triggers metathesis to
generate the preferred ordering of segments (§2.5.1.1). More generally, non-
meaningful metathesis of consonants is a reasonably common occurrence in
Momu, so much so that it initially obscured a genetic aﬃliation with Baibai
(§1.1.1).
       Momu is somewhat analytic, with concatenative morphology mostly oc-
curring in the domain of verbs (§6).29 There is a single nonlinear formative
indicating third person singular subjects via ablaut: a rounding operation
of the right edge of a stem (§2.5.1.3). This leads to phonologically driven
syncretism when there is no suitable candidate for rounding,30 as first per-
son singular subjects are the unmarked form of verbs (i.e., zero-marked).
Multiple morphological processes form verbs (§6.3). Diﬀerent sets contain
diﬀerent patterns of syncretism (§6.4). Some transitive verb-forming sets in-
corporate object marking (§6.3.3.1) and some form transitive verbs without
object marking (§6.3.3.2, §6.3.3.3). Although verb formation is common,
there are also many monomorphemic verbs (i.e., free roots).
       Word forming strategies create verbs with selectional properties that pat-
tern on an absolutive basis (i.e., the aﬀected participant). Reasonably com-
mon amongst verbs is a pattern of stem alternation such that two diﬀerent
verbs select for the number of an argument along absolutive lines (i.e., verbal
number, §6.6).31 In fact, the ratio of verbal number pairs to other verbs in
  29
      The average verb is very commonly unmarked (usually indicating first singular subject
and perfective categories), but most commonly will be marked for subject cross-reference,
aspectual and or modal categories via a single morpheme in a single slot for each of these
three.
   30
      Syncretism of first and third person singular subjects is essentially driven by the lack
of a rounding candidate on consonant-final roots. In glossing, these are readily identifiable
in examples throughout this thesis as they have an inferred gloss of “either first or third
person singular subject” ([1|3sgS]).
   31
      In grammar writing, this pattern is very commonly referred to as “suppletive number”
                                             26
Momu exists at the upper end of what is typologically evident at this point
in time (Corbett, 2000). As such, most commonly the stems are regularly
derived (§6.5, §6.6.2.3), while a minority are represented by completely diﬀer-
ent (§6.6.2.1) or partially recognisable forms (§6.6.2.1). Some word-forming
“aspectual suﬃxes” (§7.5.2) also pattern on an absolutive basis. A directional
suﬃx indicates the location or path of an aﬀected participant (§7.5.2.1), and
the incompletive suﬃx indicates the state of completeness of the aﬀected
participant (§7.5.2.4).32
    Momu has large open classes of verbs and nominals, with small closed
subclasses within them. Nominals have minimal inflectional categories, mostly
of the dependent marking kind (§4.8), outside of small closed classes like
pronouns (§3.5.2), or possessed kin terms (§4.6.2). The verbs are really the
powerhouse of the language, especially in the context of extremely common
elision of topical referents. As such, it is not uncommon for clauses to almost
entirely consist of sequences of verbs (§13).
    Momu has a nominative-accusative system of agreement. A basic rela-
tional case system diﬀerentiates subjects from non-subject arguments via
an oblique case marker, which also marks most other kinds of non-subject
(§4.8.2, §8.1.2). Subjects are nearly always cross-indexed on verbs (§6.2.1,
§8.2.1), objects less so (§8.2.2).33 Predicates can be verbal or non-verbal,
with many intransitive predicates coded by non-verbal forms (§11). Trans-
itive predicates are almost exclusively coded by verbs. There is a single pair
of ditransitive verbs: no/tu ‘give one/many’ (§3.1.2.3). Momu employs ex-
istential verbs as copulas (§11.12.3) and only in this very restricted case does
one find irregular word orders, and a diﬀerently coded subject (§8.2.1).34
    Considering the other inflectional categories of verbs, Momu possesses a
classic viewpoint aspect system of the kind where perfectives are unmarked
(§7.2) and imperfectives are marked (§7.3). Modal categories are suﬃxed on
verbs (§12.1.1), and there also exists a small set of “modal predicates”, the
majority of which concern epistemic stance (§12.1.2). Negation is marked on
clauses via a final particle (§12.2.1) or typologically uncommon complement-
or “number suppletion”. For the reasons I lay out in §6.6, I will not be continuing this
tradition here.
  32
     Aspectual suﬃxes are primarily concerned with the internal structure of the event.
  33
     Variation in the treatment of objects is both common and clear enough in Momu to
be treated as a split (8.2.2).
  34
     The split in the coding of subjects is not significant enough to justify labelling it as a
“split subject”, however.","[53, 54, 55]"

13.2.3    Cause-eﬀect
In cause-eﬀect type serialisation, an event decomposes into two (or more)
sub-events, where some agent-driven activity results in some kind of eﬀect
upon an undergoer. A prototypical (or perhaps, just typical (following Durie,
1997, pp331–333)) cause-eﬀect SVC involves a transitive cause, and intrans-
itive eﬀect. The object of the cause verb aligns with the subject or single
argument of the eﬀect verb. This is quite a departure from other SVC types
in that the subject “switches”, rather than being maintained.
   In some languages, cause-eﬀect SVCs are strictly (or strictly defined by)
switch-function (e.g. François, 2006; Hajek, 2006), or “pivot SVC” (e.g. Jar-
key, 2010, p118), but cause-eﬀect SVCs can occur outside this strict formal
criterion (Durie, 1997). Momu is a language with considerable variation in
the form of cause-eﬀect SVCs. Multiple combinations of valence are possible,
and the alignment of arguments between V1 and V2 is variable as well.
   For instance, in (13.17a) the subject of the transitive uw ‘bite’ acts upon
the object, which in turn aligns with the single argument to the final in-
transitive nasuknu ‘feel pain.’ While the same pattern of transitivity holds
in (b), the alignment of V1 object to V2 subject does not. It is instead the
subject argument of the transitive cause V1 sista ‘worry about’ that aligns
with the sole argument of the eﬀect V2 petyin ‘run away’.(13.17) (a) Yeko eru, uw=y-a-nasuknu-wo
             true that bit\3sgS=d-impf-feel.pain\3sgS-3sgS:nzr
           eru.

            ‘In this one (points to a picture), it (a bug) bit him (the dog)
            and he is feeling pain.’                                  ma-frog-story
        (b) Nepu=m       sista=petyin.
            animal=obl worry=[one.]runs.away[1|3sgS]
            ‘He ran away due to fear of an animal.’                     ferdi-tumbunaIt is not just alignments of arguments that can diﬀer in cause-eﬀect serial-
isation: so too do combinations of transitivity. In the above examples the
combination is transitive V1 with intransitive V2 . Two transitive verbs are
also possible, as are two intransitive verbs.
   The examples in (13.18) serialise (a) two transitive verbs and (b) two
transitive verbs and one ditransitive verb. These show cause-eﬀect SVCs
of the kind where there is “on-going control over subsequent sub-events”
(Durie, 1997, p332). That is, preceding events must have occurred in order
for subsequent events to be possible. Note, however, that such examples are
not usually analysed as cause-eﬀect. These may alternatively be considered
sequenced actions per Aikhenvald (2006, p26). In these examples the object
(which happens to be kuwu ‘food’ in both examples) is shared between all
verbs in serialisation (and as the theme/patient object of the give verb in
(b)).(13.18) (a) Kuwu=m kaani=kiryai-mu.
             food=obl cook=consume:1duS-vol.fut
           ‘We two will cook and eat food.’                                kaspar-fire

            ‘We will be going, finding, and bringing food for
            you.’                                             kaspar-kokomo(13.19) involves two intransitive verbs in a cause-eﬀect SVC. So far, I am
only aware of this being possible with causes relating to intransitive motion
verbs. In (a) falling tuw is the cause for the branch being broken kaanu.
The order of the verbs can be reversed, as in (b). In this decomposition of
the event the cause is breaking, not striking, and this results in the eﬀect of
falling down. (c) is a common utterance to young children climbing trees.
Again, the cause is falling, and the eﬀect is death.","[457, 458, 459]"

4.8.5.1    Possessive useGenitive NPs with an animate head are possessors. In a possessive construc-
tion, the genitive NP modifies a noun, marking it as possessed. (4.28) gives

in parallel to other cases of modifiers standing as the head of an NP (§5.2),
genitive NPs can also function as clause level NPs.
   In (4.29a) Nori=nu ‘(Those) of Nori village’ is the object of the clause.
(b) shows genitive NP functioning as a predicating NP (§11.4.1), with the
subject NP given as a right-dislocated after-thought.(4.29) (a) Oney ofuy, Nori=nu          narin.

10.1.3       Trivalent clauses
All trivalent clauses include three arguments: a subject plus either: two
objects, or two obliques, or an object and an oblique. As elsewhere, the
subject cannot be oblique-marked, and is cross-referenced on the verb. The
general preference in everyday Momu is to limit clauses to one or two (overt)
participants. Clauses which can be expressed as a single trivalent clause tend
instead to be broken apart into separate (serialised) clauses that introduce
participants individually (§13.3.3). As such, full clauses with three overt
arguments are actually quite rare in Momu.
       The verb pair no/tu ‘give one/many’ is the only case where two objects
occur. These verbs alternate for the number of the theme (T) and cross-
reference the recipient (G) in the form of the verb. There is no general
preference for ordering of the two objects in the clause. The alternate po-
sitioning of the common theme wasim ‘pawpaw(s)’ and variable recipients
shown for both the singular (10.4) and plural (10.5) verbs are grammatical.(10.4) (a) Te Flerwick=m        wasi=m  nui.
            1sg Flerwick=obl pawpaw=obl give.one:3sgIO[1sgS]
          ‘I gave Flerwick a pawpaw.’
         (b) Ay wasi=m           yery=m nema-f.
             2sg pawpaw=obl 1sg=obl give.one:1plIO-2sgS
             ‘You gave us a pawpaw.’(10.5) (a) Ni ary=m        wasi=m        tima-si
           3pl 2pl=obl pawpaw=obl give.many:1plIO-3plS
          ‘They gave you (pl.) pawpaws.’
         (b) Flerwick wasi=m          wo=m    tu.
             Flerwick pawpaw=obl 1pl=obl give.many:3sgIO\3sgS
             ‘Flerwick gave him/her pawpaws.’All other trivalent clauses combine a subject with an object and oblique (in
that order), or with two obliques.3
       Below are some basic examples of trivalent clauses with a transitive pre-
dicate. Arguments for diﬀerentiating objects and obliques are given in 8.2.2.
   3
    There are no examples in my corpus of two obliques occurring together in the one
clause. Admittedly, I did not confirm or refute this in elicitation. While it is likely
possible, further probing is necessary to confirm this.","[357, 358]"

6.3.1       Intransitive verb-forming suﬃx -ta(i)
The intransitive verb-forming suﬃx -tai is identical in form to the verb tai
‘do’.
       The same form is used in many aspectual constructions expressing an
imperfective sense (§7.5.3, §7.6, §7.4.3). In these grammaticalised cases the
form is not the host of subject inflection.10
       -Ta(i) functions both as verb-forming suﬃx to bound roots and as a
derivational suﬃx to a variety of free root forms. In some cases the form of
the root determines the word class of the verb formed.
       (6.10) shows some basic examples of intransitive verbs formed with -tai.
Kafok- in (a) is a bound root11 that combines with -tai ‘do’ or with transit-
ive verb-forming suﬃxes (§6.3.3.1). In (b) and (c), the relationships between
the nominal forms bufo ‘thought’ and ofu ‘beads’ and their verbalised coun-
terparts are clearer. Tai is very clearly used to verbalise nouns.(6.10) (a) kafoktai
            be.afraid[1sgS]
          ‘I am afraid’
         (b) bufo     > bufta
             thought      think\3sgS
             ‘thought > s/he thinks’
         (c) ofu    > ofta-si
             beads     be.decorate-3plS
             ‘beads > they are decorated’Unlike the transitive verb-forming suﬃxes (§6.3.3.1) that combine with many
bound roots and some free roots, the intransitive suﬃx can be seen as a
mostly derivational suﬃx applicable to free roots. As such it appears relat-
ively productive in verbalisation of nominals.
       The suﬃx derives an intransitive verb from members of a broad range
of word classes such as nouns, adjectives, numerals, demonstrative adverbs,
and quantifiers.
  10
      Admittedly, grammaticalised aspectual uses of -ta do sometimes host subject inflec-
tion. The variability appears to be driven in part by whether a verb root distinguishes
first from third person singular subjects. It may be that -tai fills that gap in order to
maximise identity.
   11
      I have noticed in existing Western Momu data that the bound form kafok- is a noun
kafoku ‘fear.’ It is unclear whether the noun preceded the bound form or not. I never
encountered the nominal form in my own work. Kafok- was always a bound root used to
form intransitive and transitive verbs.","[221, 222]"
"8.1.3     Ordering of participants
The typical, pragmatically unmarked ordering of participants relative to the
predicate in a clause is given by the following scale:(8.4) Subject > Object(s) > Oblique(s) > Adjunct(s) (> Predicate)A clause can have at most one subject,8 two objects, and multiple oblique
arguments and adjuncts, all preceding the predicate. There is no preferred
ordering of participants of the same category. Objects to a ditransitive verb
can occur in either order, but are preceded by the subject. Where multiple
oblique arguments occur, I am unaware of a preferred ordering between them,
but together they follow core arguments.
    Generally speaking, all participants occur before the final predicate.
However, the final participant can sometimes occur immediately after the
verb. Such a positioning retains the linear ordering of participants relative
to the scale in (8.4). This post-predicate position can be diﬀerentiated from
extra-clausal “afterthought” style clarifications in that there is no pause.
    Topical afterthought or right-dislocation (Lambrecht, 1996) can break
the above ordering of elements in that an argument higher in the scale can
occur after a lower one in a clarifying role in an afterthought. Topical after-
thoughts are further diﬀerentiated from standard post-predicate position by
intonation. The post-predicate position typically occurs within the falling
terminal contour, while, for topical afterthoughts, that terminal contour falls
on the predicate, and the afterthought has a flat or rising intonation. Both
patterns of post-predicative positioning (including the combination of both)
are demonstrated below.
   8
     I argue that external possessors are placed within a topic slot preceding the subject.
In some cases this kind of construction has been argued to be a “double subject”. See
§10.2.1 for more detail.",[316]

arguments. In such cases, relative order (§8.1.3), and properties of the verb
(§8.1.4, §8.1.1) help to distinguish them. In natural data, objects and ob-
liques rarely occur together in the same clause; instead one or the other
is already topically active, having been previously introduced, and is thus
elided (§13.3.3).
       Momu also has a range of case markers and postpositions that contribute
to the identification of oblique arguments (§8.2.3).
       Non-subject participants marked with the comitative (§4.8.3) are instru-
mental oblique arguments (§8.2.3) as in (8.2a). However, instrumental ob-
lique arguments can also be marked with the oblique =m, as in (b). The
comitative is also used to mark temporal adverbial adjuncts, as in (c).6 Fi-
nally, subjects alone can be coordinated with the comitative (§14.2.2) as in
(d), but not objects, which are instead either explicitly coordinated with the
comitative verb bar (§13.2.6) as in (e), or simply coordinated asyndetically

ing’ or finyib ‘night’, and is also used with deverbal clauses to form temporal adverbial

comitative are with Tok Pisin loan words relating to time concepts.","[313, 314]"

graphically as such with a hyphen between forms.314.1.1      Co-compounds
In Momu, co-compounds (or coordinative compounds) are uncommon and
are certainly not productive like many sub-compounds. The forms are all
single phonological words. This is evident from a number of phonological
conditioning eﬀects. Most notably, lengthening of the vowel in any open
final syllable (§2.1.1) is limited to the second lexeme.
    Almost all of the coordinative compounds discovered so far relate to
pairs or groups of people. Note that the order of nouns in these compounds
is fixed. For instance, (14.1a) gives the proper ordering of nouns, while the
reverse ordering in (b) is unattested.(14.1) (a) mu-yime
           women-men
          ‘people’
       (b) * yime-muThe above compound demonstrates phonological integration in two ways.
First, as an open mono-syllabic form, mu ‘woman’ would ordinarily be ob-
ligatorily lengthened (§2.4.1), but it remains shortened in the compound
form. The vowel in mu is also raised (§2.5.4), by coming into contact with
the initial glide in yime ‘man’.
    The most common co-compounds involve possessed kin nouns, all of
which are listed at the end of §4.6.2. These co-compounds refer to pairs
in some form of special, and possibly reciprocal relationship. As such, few
combinations are possible. (14.2a) mufo-yefu ‘married couple’ is an obvi-
ous pairing, while (b) sifu-abfu ‘same sex sibling pair’ is perhaps less so.

      Outside this chapter, those compounds that are especially exocentric may be written
as a single word (i.e., without hyphenation) with a single gloss. This leaves several degrees
of variation (and representation): at one end fully lexicalised forms which are given a single
gloss and no indication of their etymology, at the other separate lexical items with the
same glosses as they would have had they occurred alone. The nature of the compound
is reflected in the free translation.","[482, 483]"

C.3        Diachronic aside on the polysemy of na-
In some cases there is a limited degree of polysemy between a plural in-
transitive form (e.g., napwen ‘many come’) and a singular transitivised form
(e.g., napwen ‘bring one’). It is interesting that the same morpheme derives
alternate forms that express diﬀerent number values, but it is possible to
hypothesise why such a development may have occurred.
       The singular transitivising na- and the plural intransitive na- most likely
have grammaticalised from a single serial verb construction using the verb
*na ‘get’ (prior to the development of verbal number).13 A get verb is
a source of valence increasing morphology or constructions in many serial
verb languages (Aikhenvald, 2006, p13), and indeed is a common source for
causatives, instruments and patients (Heine and Kuteva, 2002, pp286–290).
While the likely source of the singular transitivising form na- is clear, the
plural form tye- is at present unclear. The plural correspondent of (pa)na
‘get one’ has the two forms pun ‘get many’ and popra(i) ‘get many’, neither
of which can be related to tye-.
       How the same form came to be grammaticalised as a singular distinction
in the case of the transitivising prefix and a plural distinction in the case
of the intransitive plural can be explained by a semantic division in their
application and how this was integrated into the clause. First I assume that
GET had two uses in serialisation: to gather a person in order for them to
participate in an activity, and to gather an object in order to perform an
activity upon it. In both cases, the serial verb construction that preceded the
grammaticalisation was likely of the form get X (and) do-Y. I propose that a
human referent X combined with the (intransitive) motion-based activities,
and that a non-human referent X combined with transitive activity verbs
centrally concerned with altering X (e.g., transport, cut, process and
so on).
       In the case of an intransitive do-Y, the human referent of X came to be
incorporated into the set of referents for the subject of do-Y. Most likely
this started with motion verbs and then generalised to the other intransitive
verbs (e.g., ‘I get them and go’ > ‘we go’). This construction still exists syn-
  13
     Na means ‘marry’ in my main field site of Mori village, where they use the separate
lexical form pana to mean ‘get one’. Older and/or more conservative speakers in Savamui
and Mumuru villages use na for both ‘marry’ and ‘get one’, but recognise pana as a form
younger speakers have adopted.","[657, 658]"

Concerning the order of suﬃxation, it is clear that directional distinctions
(§7.5.2.1) are the inner-most. They are the most common, most phonologic-
ally integrated, and the most subject to lexicalisation.
   Following directionals are “inner operators”: extended aspect (§7.5.2.2)
and exhaustive aspect (§7.5.2.3). These are more verb-like in that they host
subject marking. Between inner and outer is the transitional incompletive
(§7.5.2.4).
   Finally, there are the “outer operators”: the distributive (§7.5.2.5), the
“until sunrise” aspect (§7.5.2.6). These are less verb-like, in that they do not
host subject inflection. Examples of the “lose-completive” -keyta (§7.5.2.7)
are too scarce to classify at the present stage of analysis.","[292, 293]"

15.1       Relative clauses
Relative clauses are subordinate clauses that function as nominal modifiers
(Thompson, Longacre and Hwang, 2007). These clauses can function to re-
strict the reference of the nominal that they modify (Andrews, 2007; Keenan
and Comrie, 1977), but can also function to supplement a clause with detail
that extends beyond reference. Both types are considered here.2
    The basic components of a relative clause in Momu are a head noun, a
reduced, sentence-like clause (§16.6), and a relativiser—in that order. The
distal demonstrative eru and sometimes the proximal form anu, and their
reduced counterparts3 e and a are used as relativisers in Momu. The rel-
ative clause is positioned after the noun that it modifies. Specific alternate
constructions exist for obliques (§15.1.2) and genitives (§15.1.3).
    The overall NP containing the relative clause may be case-marked to
indicate its relation to the main clause. Because additional modifiers are
limited and uncommon, the case marker is generally applied to the relative
clause on the right edge. The noun being modified by the relative clause
is unmarked for its role within the subordinate clause. There is no relative
pronoun within the relative clause.4 In the absence of overt marking, the
role of the relativised head within the relative clause is often inferred from
context.
    (15.1) shows examples of relative clauses where the head noun’s role
within the relative clause is (a) subject, (b) object, (c) location-oblique,
(d) instrument-oblique, (e) theme-oblique, and (f) genitive. Relative clauses
are marked in bold. These roles attract relational-case marking (except
subjects) in main clause positions (§4.8.1, §8.2.2, §8.2.3), but case is not in
any way marked on the head noun in the subordinate clause. The role of
the relativised noun in the relative clause is generally inferred from context.
That context includes the absence of an NP in the relevant position in the
relative clause, but then it is also very common for other elements (including
    2
      Not considered here: relative clauses in Momu are a major and common type of
insubordination (Heine, Kaltenböck and Kuteva, 2016). A casual glance over the example
texts (§A) will reveal many instances of insubordinate uses of the demonstratives anu and
eru. Unfortunately, for reasons of space, this topic will not be treated in this thesis.
    3
      The reduced relativisers e and a are clitics. Most commonly they form a phonological
word with a case marker, or they are enclitic to the predicate of the relative clause. The
combination of the relativiser anu with the directional marker =ti often reduces to anti.
    4
      Relative pronouns are not used generally, except in a subset of cases where a genitive
is relativised (§15.1.3).","[515, 516]"

      ‘I get a knife. I will go clear the garden’                      monica-gardenThe limitation of a single non-subject participant for each verb not only leads
to prior establishment of participants, it also gives rise to SVC types which
introduce participants. Verbs of obtaining such as panai ‘get one’, pun ‘get
many’ and poprai ‘get many’, verbs of holding or carrying (§13.2.1.3) or even
transitive motion verbs (§13.2.3.2) can be used as a kind of support verb to
introduce participants within SVCs. The semantics of these verbs are often
bleached in such cases, as introducing the participant appears to be their
primary function.
   For instance, the verb pair noi/tui ‘give one/many’ cross-references the
recipient-object and alternates for the number of the theme-object. In order
to express a first or second person theme-object, a supporting ‘get’ verb is
used to introduce that referent:(13.41) wa-pana=noi-mu                                        /

      ‘I will give you (sg.) to him / I will give you (pl.) to him’          2012.62The verb as ‘show to’ cross-references a recipient-object like ‘give’, but as
does not alternate for the number of theme-oblique. I have tentatively ana-
lysed this verb as accompanying another verb in serialisation to introduce a
beneficiary (§13.2.5).","[474, 475]"

A similar transformation of number is shown in (13.49), except that the
verb kiripnin ‘chop finely’ encodes plural number in its form. The object is
initially singular (as shown by the form of napwen ‘bring it’) but is considered
plural once transformed.

13.3.4.2    Scope of verbal numberFrequent topical elision of NP arguments often means that identifying the
role of participants in an SVC can be diﬃcult. Verbal number, not being
bound by grammatical constraints, can contribute to the identification of
referents in some specific combinations in SVCs. In this section, I focus on
the verb nukiy to demonstrate this.
    Nukiy ‘load’ is a verb of containment which can be considered number
sensitive in that the speaker can make a choice between making a reference
to a contained plural entity, or reduce it to a singular one by referring to
the container (of course singular contained entities and plural containers
are possible—but not together). Nukiy ‘load’, like in English, has two case
frames diﬀerentiated by word order where either the contained or container is
coded as an object, and the other as an oblique. Nukiy does not code verbal
number, but within other SVC types such as a preparative (§13.2.3.1), the
verb following it can select for the number of either the container or contained
entities.","[478, 479]"

"11.12.3     Copulas
Both the animate existential ai ‘be / there is’ and the inanimate existential
wu are used as copulas with attributional predicates. In these constructions,
the copula is more verb-like in that the subject is cross-referenced on the
                                      382
animate form of the existential verb. Limited modal and aspectual inflection
is available as well.
   Two possible codings are available when the existential verbs are used
as copulas. The two verbs select for the animacy of their subject. The
attributive adjective can then be positioned in the initial “subject” slot, as in
(11.52b). The realis progressive form of the copula is used to indicate that
the state of aﬀairs currently holds but does not imply that it will be ongoing
(or has previously been the case).
(11.52)                                                                     2008.210      (a) Te emsu=m       n-a-ya.

      (b) Emsu te=m          n-o-wo.
          good 1sg=obl px-[impf]inan:there.be-3sgS:nzr
          ‘I am good/lucky.’When both subject and predicate are inanimate, argument order cannot be
altered. The subject fills the subject position.","[410, 411]"

Because first person singular subjects are unmarked, and because third per-
son singular is often also unmarked (and in these cases identical to first
person singular), the “host” of subject marking is frequently indeterminate
for first or third person singular subjects. In this case, it appears that the
subject can be hosted by -ta in order to clarify the reference.","[306, 307]"

(3.12) (a) sufy ‘hold s.t.’
      (b) pum-ar ‘gather s.t.’ (cf. tp bung ‘gather’)
      (c) fofyar ‘kiss s.o.’
      (d) tit-an/tit-nin ‘tie up one/many’Some, but not all verbs in this subclass can inflect for non-third-person ob-
jects via object prefixes (§6.2.2.2). Unlike with high-transitive verbs, how-
ever, object prefixes are obligatory when there is a first or second person
referent.
   A relatively common pattern in Momu is for verbs to pair, such that they
alternate for the number of an argument on an absolutive basis (§6.6), as we
have already seen for intransitive verbs (§3.1.1). Again, these vary from free
forms (e.g., (3.13a), §6.6.2.1) through to (most commonly) (b) forms derived
from a common intransitive base (§6.6.2.3), with some values in between
(§6.6.2.2). The majority of these verbs select for a non-human or inanimate
object, but in cases where their meaning has expanded to take in human
referents, they also employ object prefixes for speech-act participants. In
this case, each verb in the pair has a defective paradigm in line with the
number of the object.(3.13) (a) uy/kwen ‘cut one/many (tall, upright object)’
      (b) na-pwen/tye-pwen ‘bring one/many’3.1.2.3     Ditransitive verbThe only ditransitive verb in Momu is the lemma expressed by the stem
alternates no/tu ‘give one/many’. For this verb pair stem alternation indexes
the number of the theme object, and the recipient indirect object is cross-
referenced. The indirect object cross-reference is fused into the form of the
verb. The two objects have no preferential order apart from both occurring
after the subject (§8.2.2). Both objects are oblique-marked.(3.14) (a) Slupi te=m        wasi=m nera.
           Slupi 1sg=obl pawpaw=obl give.one:1sgIO\3sgS
          ‘Slupi gave me a pawpaw’
      (b) Slupi wasi=m         te=m tira.
          Slupi pawpaw=obl 1sg=obl give.many:1sgIO\3sgS
          ‘Slupi gave me pawpaws’                                     98
These are the only verbs that exhibit verbal number and full object cross-
reference where the two do not align. See §6.4.3 for examples of other irreg-
ular cases.","[125, 126, 127]"

AcknowledgmentsThis project simply would not have been possible without the support of the
people of Mori village, Sandaun Province, PNG. Many Mori people helped
me—more than I can name—but I especially have to single out Bernard and
Monica. Bernard, your often poetic descriptions breathed life into complex
problems. Sometimes, banging my head against the wall, a quick aside from
you was the inspiration for a lengthy detour through a hidden grammatical
side-path that I didn’t realise was right in front of my eyes. Monica, your
levelheaded explanations kept me on task. Your stamina in plodding through
some of the more tedious aspects of gathering texts and paradigms is awe
inspiring. And your ability to bridge the gap as my Tok Pisin developed and
intuit what on earth I was talking about was astounding. I honestly don’t
think I would have got this far without your patient guidance.
    In Mori, thanks also to Antonia, Simon, and Peter Yefiye for your as-
sistance with stories and with elicitation. Thanks Flerwick, Kaspar, Julie,
Luke, Peter and Angela, and Agnela for your contributions to the stories
we collected. To Steven Arame, thanks for your assistance both in matters
linguistic and logistic. I hope in my own small ways I was able to repay some
of your kindness.
    In terms of staying alive in Mori, it was really thanks to the generosity of
some key people who Fiona and I will always be indebted to. In 2005, thanks
to Flerwick, Yasu and your lovely family—Osi, Slupi and liklik Luk —for
hosting Fiona and I, but thanks also to Monica and to Julie for helping out
with food. To Primus, thanks for hosting me in 2008. There’s nothing like
lengthy late night conversations about the meaning of life to hone one’s Tok
Pisin, let alone sort out one’s priorities! In 2010, thanks to Kaspar and Keti,
and your wonderful family (Mambe, Andrew, Rachel, Mina, Larry, Maiklin,
Irene, Karl, Glenda, Ann and Ian) for hosting Fiona and me. You were truly
generous with us, and we really enjoyed being part of your family. Thanks
again for looking after me in 2012 as well.
    In Savamui village, thanks to Ferdi and Yarin for your frequently hilari-
ous tales. I really enjoyed working with you both, but also just chatting.
You both have a wicked sense of humour! Thanks also for your hospitality.
Thanks also to Denis, and to little John. Thanks to Dianne and Andrew
Solmo for hosting Fiona and I during walks to Savamui in 2005.
    Thanks to the people of Mumuru village for hosting Fiona and I for those
two weeks in 2010, and to Antonia and Francis for putting us up. After a
rough patch in our fieldwork, we truly felt welcomed. I only wish that I had
planned to spend more time in your lovely village.
    Thanks to all those many people who contributed to the big singsing
at Mori, Savamui and Mumuru. Thanks also to the very many people who
shared their food with me, and helped in other ways. Sitting on so many
balconies and shooting the breeze with so many warm and welcoming people
was to me the best part of working in PNG. Lewa bilong mi i stap wantaim

thoughtful and patient comments and support over these many years.
   Thanks to the linchpin of RSPAS, CHL, and whatever it is called as I
write this: Jo Bushby, admin, and all round superhero for all your support.
Seriously, nothing would ever get done around here without you!
   Thanks to my family for their support over the too many years, especially
to my mother, Ann Tout, for helping out with Neve in the final stages.
   Finally special thanks to my partner Fiona. This turned out to be quite
the journey, from those heady early days adventuring around PNG to where
we are now. Honestly I couldn’t have done it without you. Thanks for your
support, emotional and practical, your (not insignificant) patience and, well,
for everything!
AbstractThis thesis is a description of the grammar of Eastern Momu, a language
spoken in Papua New Guinea in the north-western province of Sandaun.
This is a region with a fair amount of diversity, with several isolates or small
language families, and few detailed descriptions. Momu, or Fas as it is more
commonly known in the literature, together with the virtually undocumented
Baibai language, forms one of these small language families.
   The thesis is structured such that after a general introduction to the
people, language, and region, I give chapters covering: phonology, phonot-
actics and morphophonemics (Ch. 2), word classes (Ch. 3), nominals (Ch.
4), noun phrases (Ch. 5), verbs (Ch. 6), aspect (ch. 7), grammatical re-
lations (Ch. 8), adverbs (Ch. 9), clauses (Ch. 10), non-verbal predicates
(Ch. 11), modality and negation (Ch. 12), serial verb constructions (Ch.
13), compounds and coordination (Ch. 14), subordination (Ch. 15) and
complementation (Ch. 16).
   At first glance, Momu has a relatively uncomplicated five vowel phon-
ology, or ten vowels if one includes length. Glides hold a special position
within the phonology, phonotactics and morphophonology, as I have ana-
lysed it. Glides interact heavily with adjacent segments including metathesis
with adjacent consonants in a predictable fashion. Additional phonetic long
high vowels arise from some glide-vowel combinations. Amongst the conson-
ants, there is a bilabial trill. This is an areal feature that is rare amongst
the world’s languages.
   A marked feature of the verbal system, but also areally, is a relatively high
count of verbs coding verbal number. Verbal number in Momu is conservat-
ively estimated to occupy 30% of the verbal lexicon, placing it at the upper
end of the typological space. The theme of verbal number runs throughout
the thesis as its relatively high frequency makes for contrastive behaviour in
certain domains.
   Momu has some classically ""Papuan"" features such as serial verb con-
structions and verb-final ordering (albeit not strictly so). This thesis aims
to position Momu within the growing body of work describing the incredible
features, number and variety of languages of Papua New Guinea, but also to
focus on a region within Papua New Guinea with perhaps a higher degree of
diversity and lower total count of documentation overall.

Chapter 1Introduction1.1    The Momu language and its speakers
The Bewani Ranges are in the north-western corner of Papua New Guinea, in
Sandaun Province. They stretch from the border with West Papua eastward
to the Torricelli Ranges. At the eastern end of the Bewani ranges, there are
two strings of villages—one each on the northern and southern slopes. Momu
is spoken in these villages. An intricate web of tributaries flowing from the
ranges has created vast deltas on either side. Some maps indicate that the
language spreads north to the coast, but this is not the case. The villages are
spread out over a large area, with as little as an hour’s walk, but sometimes
up to two day’s walk between them. With so much distance, intermarriage
or other direct contact between the eastern-most and western-most villages
is unheard of.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"

Despite their similar semantics, these verbs map T and G diﬀerently onto
grammatical relations. Both verbs are confirmed as transitive via the fea-
tures laid out in §8.1.4.1. Additionally, the object or oblique status of non-
subject arguments is confirmed by their fixed ordering (while the objects of
a ditransitive could occur in either order). The choice in alignment above
demonstrates the split in behaviour for coding objects such that {O=G} and
{O=T}. Transitive verbs essentially fall into these two categories.
   The above trivalent clauses are concerned with a human recipient-G.
Many other trivalent constructions dis-prefer or disallow a human G. This
is the case for verbs of placement, or caused location. For instance, the G of
the verb etyinu cannot be a human referent. Instead a body part (formally
treated as inanimate) is given as G.
(8.19) Tibe         bofu=m        etyinu.
        cloth.strip head=obl tie.one\3sgS
      ‘(She) tied a strip of cloth around (her) head.’             picture-task-part1
For these trivalent clauses, the G is often clearly an oblique argument when it
is coded by a locative NP, as shown by the spatial term niny ‘above’ (8.20a),
and the directional-marked mamoti ‘on the other side’ (b). However, G can
still be an oblique-marked NP as in kwo afam ‘to another tree’ in (b), or obim
‘in the pot’ in (c). Oblique argument status is confirmed by the transitive
status of the verbs in (a) and (b) on the basis of verbal number patterning
(§8.1.4.1), and also the fixed ordering of object and oblique arguments. For
(c) nukiy ‘load’ only the fixed ordering of T before G confirms that the T is
an object and G an oblique argument. For this verb, G cannot be marked
with directional case or a spatial postposition.","[329, 330]"

refers to the source of the information. The object to the transitive form
refers to the recipient of the information.
       In all cases here, if one considers the speech complement as filling an
argument position, then the utterance complement is oblique according to
the criteria laid out in §8. For reported speech, the argument status or even
embedded status of such a complement is often disputed (De Roeck, 1994;
Thompson, 2002).
       In order to be consistently interpreted as utterance predicates, the com-
plement to these verbs usually follows the verb. Unlike many other comple-
ment clause types in this chapter, there is no complementiser.2 The form
of the complement is sentence-like (§16.6), and shows no restriction on the
marking of categories on the complement. The utterance is often accompan-
ied by voice quality and intonation consistent with an independent clause.
All of these factors combined indicate that in Momu utterance complements
are the least syntactically integrated of all complement clauses, to the extent
that it is questionable whether they are subordinate at all.
       Other strategies exist for conveying reported speech. A reference to the
source via an NP, followed immediately by the complement, or even just
a shift in voice quality in the absence of an utterance CTP can indicate a
shift in footing such that the hearer understands that the speech of another
person is being conveyed.

ted, but it is unlikely that these were equivalent cases of reported speech. Oblique-marked
complements to the verbs yeni ‘say’ and yeyen ‘say to’ usually signal a diﬀerent meaning
to reported speech (§16.1.2).","[556, 557]"

13.1     Identifying SVCs
Relevant diagnostic and classificatory criteria for SVCs in Momu include
(1) concordant or shared subject marking and TAM marking; (2) the ab-
sence of marking of coordination or subordination, and the absence of se-
quence marking particles or expressions; (3) lexemic status; (4) the absence
of participants (especially non-subject participants); and (5) the ordering of
participants such that they precede verbs that do not license them.
   Shared subject marking on the final verb indicates that the verbs or verb
phrases are not coordinated. This criterion is shared with compound forms,
and so is necessary but not suﬃcient. The primary indicators of coordination
or subordination in Momu are clause-level uses of relational case (§14.2, §15)
and nominalisation (§16.5). However, Momu is a language which includes
                                     418
intonational coordination (§14.2.1) as a coordinative strategy. That is, there
is no overt marking of coordination in some cases. However, combined with
subject marking, these two features serve to identify many SVCs in Momu.
       At the more integrated end of the spectrum, I take loss of semantic
content in lexemes in a multi-verb construction as an indicator of grammat-
icalisation. This is not a clear cut category, rather a gradable one. The more
productive and semantically opaque a verb is within one of these construc-
tions, the more likely I treat it not as an SVC, but rather something else.
For instance, the order in which the aspectual suﬃxes are presented in §7.5.2
is analogous to the degree to which I consider them grammaticalised. Forms
like pan ‘do until sunrise’ (§7.5.2.6) or ketyai ‘incompletive’ (§7.5.2.7) could
reasonably be considered an SVC that has more recently begun the path to
grammaticalisation.
       There is a general restriction on the number of overt participants that can
be included within, or accompany an SVC. Multiple participants preceding
a verb is an indicator that the verb is not in serialisation with the verbs that
follow it. Restriction or absence of relational-case marking on participants is
indicative of serialisation (§13.3.3). In some cases, a participant is separated
from the verb that licenses it, and the verbs in serialisation form a contiguous
unit (per Aikhenvald, 2006). Momu has both contiguous and non-contiguous
SVCs. Where an argument is separated from the verb that licenses it by a
prior verb or verbs in a contiguous collection of verbs, I take this as a strong
indicator that this is in fact an SVC.
       In (13.1), (13.2) and (13.3) below are some basic examples of SVCs in
Momu, which demonstrate all of these defining criteria.
       In (13.1a) we see a marginal type of cause-eﬀect SVC (§13.2.3). The
two verbs in serialisation are kaani ‘cook’ and kiy ‘consume’. The verbs
are tightly bound together as a single phonological word. The subject is
marked once, on the final verb. There is no marking to indicate that the
material preceding kisyi is subordinate to the the final verb. Compare this
to the adverbial clause (§15.3) in (13.1b), where the subordinate relationship
is indicated by the comitative.1 TAM marking, where present, only occurs
on the final verb in a SVC. The presence of TAM marking on both verbs in
   1
    Subordinate clauses are always overtly marked in Momu, but note that coordinate
clauses are not. See §14.2.1.3 for more detail on intonational coordination of clauses. So,
while the presence of subordinate marking diﬀerentiates subordination from SVCs, the
absence of marking alone does not diﬀerentiate coordinated clauses from SVCs.","[446, 447]"

2.4.3       Complex word-final clusters
            arising from suﬃxing
In §2.3.2.2 I demonstrate word-final CC(G) and GC sequences. Here I discuss
the syllabification of these sequences.
       Beginning with C1 C2 #, these syllabify diﬀerently depending on the nat-
ural class of C2 (t, b, r, f, s, m).46 C2 sonorants (m, b, and r ) become syllabic
in this position, and C1 is then assigned as the onset of this syllable.
(2.41) (a) pupm [pŬ.pm] ‘bush knife + oblique’
                           ""
      (b) arm [P5.rm] ‘you pl. + oblique’
                      ""
      (c) kosm [kŎ.sm] ‘road + oblique’
                         ""
(2.42) (a) atb [P5.tà] ‘when we were (there)’
                      ""
      (b) panb [pa.nà] ‘when the sun rose’
                        ""
      (c) tukb [tŬ.kà] ‘with urine’
                      ""
The first plural subject marker -t/-r has two forms that occur mostly in free
variation. The morpheme usually surfaces as t in word-final Ct when C is
more sonorous. A syllabic r is used when preceded by a stop (2.43d).
  45
     The order of these final CG sequences matches that of an onset. In a limited set
of circumstances, the morphophonemic rules of Momu even provides a mechanism for
preserving this ordering in the context of suﬃxing morphology (§2.5.1.1). Given that
these word-final sequences have the appearances of an onset, an approach such as Harris
and Gussmann (2002) where the word-final coda is instead taken to be the onset of an
abstract empty syllable, may be applicable to Momu.
  46
     Prior to syllabification, many forms given here are subject to morphophonological
processes which move or delete glides (§2.5). Only the resolved forms are shown here.","[94, 95]"

bilabial trills to fricatives. Older and especially male speakers consistently
trilled, while everyone else produced a fricative most of the time. Labialisa-
tion is a frequent and marked feature of Western Momu (Baron p.c.) and
is present to a degree in the speech of older speakers. In some cases, it
appears that this labialisation is an accompanying feature of some conson-
ants—especially bilabial trills—but it is not limited to these segments.
   Many of the eﬀects of the glides on neighbouring segments are lost in the
speech of younger speakers. Denasalisation, palatalisation, and labialisation
on neighbouring consonants are generally lost, and devoiced glides are lost
altogether (as in pup ‘bush knife’ in Table 2.26). Word-final glides that
“resurface” when reattaching to a following vowel-initial word are generally
lost as well for the youngest speakers but are preserved for Eastern Momu

speakers. Observant readers may notice that forms are sometimes written
with or without glides in the remaining chapters of this thesis. This variation
in spelling is representative of speaker variation.
   A handful of pairs of distinct verbs collapse with the flattening of the
vowel space. What has developed in its place is a tendency for these verbs to
be accompanied by a dummy object to preserve the diﬀerence. For instance,
consider ki ‘sleep’ and kiy ‘eat’. For those that flatten the vowel space,
these forms are homophonous. In order to diﬀerentiate them, they are nearly
always accompanied by a kind of dummy object like tyako ‘a nap’ or cognate
object like kuwu ‘food’ respectively. To contrast si ‘smell’ and siy ‘urinate’,
both are accompanied by dummy objects abka ‘sweet smell’ or fwa ‘bad
smell’ and tuk ‘bladder’ respectively.","[114, 115]"

5.6    An overview of possession in noun phrases
Multiple markers and constructions relating to possession are introduced
in the previous chapter and in this one, and further strategies in the form
of compounds are given in §14.1.2. In this section I compare possession
strategies that are coded in the form of an NP. I consider the locus of
marking, the order of possessor and possessed components, animacy, and
alienability. Predicative possession is considered in §11.4 and lack of posses-
sion in §11.10.",[205]

7.5.2       Dynamic (“suﬃxing”) aspects
The suﬃxing aspects are all concerned with deriving situation aspect. The
forms considered here (the “suﬃxing aspects”) are all concerned with various
features related to events. The stativiser, while also suﬃxing, is considered
separately (§7.5.3).
       All suﬃxing aspects can be related to synchronic full verbs. All probably
arose from grammaticalisation of serial verb constructions. Many relate to
cause-eﬀect type serialisation (§13.2.3). Cause-eﬀect serialisations are oth-
erwise not all that common in Momu.
       I treat suﬃxing aspects here as verb marking rather than serialisation for
several reasons. First, the suﬃxes generally combine with a verb as a single
phonological word. They variably show some sign of grammaticalisation,
ranging from phonological reduction to loss of semantic detail, or loss of
inflectional categories. Some suﬃxes host subject marking, while others
do not, but generally speaking if both host subject marking then they are
interpreted as serial or coordinated verbs.13 A major test is progressivisation.
Suﬃxed forms can be progressivised, while in serial verb constructions, only
the final verb can be progressivised.
       Verbs marked by any of the suﬃxes in this section are events, and as
such are perfective in the absence of further marking.14 These marked forms
can be rendered imperfective with the addition of the imperfective marker
a(i)-.
       The forms discussed here show varying degrees of grammaticalisation,
analogous to the relative order in which they apply to a verb stem, with
those forms closest to the stem being the most grammaticalised. I break
them down into three rough categories, as indicated below:(7.26) VERB ROOT -(DIRECTION) -(INNER) -(OUTER)
  13
     In very specific cases, a suﬃxing aspect may not generally host subject inflection, but
becomes the host of inflection when the verb root is unable to distinguish some values due
to phonologically conditioned syncretism (§6.2.1).
  14
     The only suﬃxing form that has an imperfective reading is the stativiser -ta(i) (§7.5.3).","[291, 292]"
"(8.9) Word class: non-verb (noun > adjective) > verb(8.10) Subject Marking: none > third person singular subject >
       single/plural > full subject marking
  14
     High-transitive verbs (those including full object cross-reference, or nominal object
number) have the opposite selectional preferences to verbs coding verbal number. High-
transitive verbs strongly prefer human objects while transitive verbal number pairs prefer
non-human objects. Cross-referenced subjects are most commonly human, but as the
selectional preference tends towards non-human referents, the predicate tends towards
defective person and number, with the endpoint being a non-verbal form. Given this,
intransitive verbs that pair for verbal number do not exhibit the same selectional preference
for non-humans on the absolutive argument, unlike transitive verbal number pairs.",[323]

3.5     Minor word classes
3.5.1    Spatial postpositions
Postpositions in Momu are limited to a pair of spatial terms (§3.5.1). At the
clause level these postpositions signal that the overall phrasal unit is func-
tioning as a locative oblique (§8.2.3). Postpositional phrases can function
adnominally in locative NPs.
   The spatial postpositions are niny ‘above/on’ and tin ‘inside’ (3.28).
These postpositions occur in complementary distribution with relational
markers such as the oblique and directional cases, (3.29). Additional spatial
distinctions are otherwise made by spatial nominals (§4.4) or verbs (§3.6.2).(3.28) (a) Fiky niny y-o-wo.

          ‘It is inside.’3.5.2       Pronouns
Personal pronouns in Momu distinguish singular and plural number, and
first, second and third persons (§4.1).23 In addition to this, personal pro-
nouns can be marked with the comitative (§4.1.1), genitive (§4.1.2), or both
(§4.1.3). There are additionally special emphatic forms that are fused with
the reciprocal-emphatic adverb ak (§4.1.4). Finally, there is a unique and
rare third singular form wotine ‘s/he, for his part’ (§4.1.5).
    Momu does not generally employ a relative pronoun unless a possessor of
an alienable referent is relativised. In this case, a genitive-marked pronoun
is used as a relative pronoun (§15.1.3). There is a single indefinite pro-
noun bekubeku ‘(some)thing(s)’. This is a reduplicated form of the question
word beku ‘what’—a common source of indefinites in the world’s languages
(Haspelmath, 1997, p179). The demonstratives also function pronominally
(§5.4.5).
  23
     The dimensions of the personal pronouns diﬀer from argument cross-reference in lack-
ing a dual distinction (§6.2.1). Conversely, there are several syncretic patterns in both
subject and object cross-reference (§6.4).","[134, 135]"
"2.1.4.2    Mid-high vowel and glide diphthongsThe combinations of mid-high vowels (/e/ and /o/) with glides are a special
case. Although glides aﬀect the non-mid-high vowels only minimally, in the
neighbourhood of glides, mid-high vowels are realised as higher. In the most
extreme case—/je/ and /wo/—they surface as monophthongal long pure
high vowels (§2.1.4.3).
   The combinations /jo/, /oj/ and /we/ are high ([ji], [uj], [wi]) or near
high ([jI], [Uj], [wI]) vowel diphthongs. /ew/ is unattested.(2.13) /jo/: /Esjo/ [PĔsj ju] ‘dog’, /junje/ [jundi] ‘sun’

(2.14) /oj/: /moj/ [mŨj] ‘cassowary’, /ojmo/ [PUjmõ] ‘I will cut it’(2.15) /we/: /mwe/ [mbw wi] ‘cassowary’, /wenase/ [wIn˘ã se] ‘they swing’The choice between the phonemicisation /oj/ and /we/ can be a little diﬃcult
to determine. While they contrast word-initially, elsewhere they are non-
contrastive (and subject to variation). Take /mwe/ or /moj/ for “cassowary”.
Some speakers make a noticeable denasalisation of the initial nasal ([mbw wi]),
while others do not. Transcribing as /mwe/ with the glide next to the nasal
would be one way of indicating this denasalisation. Only a subset of the
consonants vary when followed by a glide, so, in this case, it is probably
safer to opt for the more generally preferred ordering of GV. VG ordering
only occurs word-finally in mono-morphemic words.
       The sequences /ej/ and /ow/ arise only in a limited set of lexemes. Firstly
they only occur in the verbs /kej/ ‘eat’, /sej/ ‘urinate’, /nej/ ‘shoot one’,
/mOàkej/ ‘lay out’, /nafOfkej/ ‘carry on shoulder’ and /nokej/ ‘fill up’. These
verbs then have corresponding rounded third person singular subject forms
/kow/, /sow/, /now/ and /nokow/. Speakers refer to this as TP nek hevi
‘heavy voice’. The starting point of the diphthong varies a little from speaker
to speaker, with surface realisations of [Ij ⇠ @j ⇠ 1j] attested with correspond-
ing back variants [Uw ⇠ @w ⇠ 0w].19
       For a subset of these forms in Eastern Momu, the possibility of the diph-
thong arising via a linker vowel remains an open question (§2.4.5). This is
not an uncommon question amongst papuan languages (Blevins and Pawley,
2010; Jendraschek, 2012), and is made all the more problematic by phon-
emicisation choices of glides or high vowels, as demonstrated for Iatmul and
Kalam by Foley (1986, pp51–52).
  19
    Baron (p.c.) gives several more forms in Western Momu (transcribed in the ortho-
graphy used here): /fej/ ‘breast(milk)’, /aeEànej/ ‘talk secretly’, /àoànej/ ‘break up’,
/Esfej/ ‘leg’, /fEsnej/ ‘one’, /nafkej/ ‘carry on shoulder’. Many of these (non-verbal)
forms I record as long high vowels (/je/ or /wo/) rather than /ej/ or /ow/. This may
be a side eﬀect of the general flattening of the vowel space (§2.6.2). Some forms have
other diﬀerences in Eastern Momu (/Esfej/ : /Eàsje/, /nafkej/ : /nafOfkej/). Almost all
forms are verbs, and this means that the underlying form is confirmed by glide-consonant
metathesis which results in root-final glides being moved from a coda position to the onset
of a suﬃx, and separated from the diphthong (§2.5.1.1). It may be this morphophonolo-
gical feature that has helped preserve this unusual diphthong in Eastern Momu in higher
frequency verbs.","[75, 76]"

to’ to the object prefixes, not the least of which is that I am at present
unaware of any other languages grammaticalising ‘show’ as a means of object
marking. The source of the final segment or segments in the verb-forming
suﬃxes need to be motivated, and the loss of the final s for both the prefixes
and suﬃxes also needs to be motivated.
   The deletion of s for the prefixing forms is easiest to motivate. There
is elsewhere some synchronic evidence of stem-final consonant deletion in
the context of tight serialisation (§2.5.3). Motivating the final consonant
(n or r ) in the verb-forming suﬃxes is more diﬃcult. As the source of the
object marking prefixes or as verb-forming suﬃxes, the loss of the final s
must be motivated. Instead, I appeal to more general processes applying to
compounding. The final segment may have been lost for the prefixing forms
through compounding with other verbs. Ar is a synchronic full verb ‘do to’.
This is the likely source of the r -set. As noted in §6.3.3.3, several verbs have
an as their stem-final segments. From this, I assume that there was once a
verb an. Compounding with these verbs possibly produced the verb-forming
suﬃxes.
   Finally, most diﬃcult to motivate, is the overt marking of third person                                      203
for both singular and plural number in the verb-forming suﬃxes but the lack
of overt marking for the third person in the prefixing forms. This hypothesis
requires motivating a serialisation pattern that has applied to local persons
(i.e., first and second persons) but not to third persons.
   First, it must be noted that object prefixing applies variably to diﬀerent
classes of verbs. Verbs formed via an object cross-indexing verb-forming
suﬃx optionally (and redundantly) use object prefixing. Otherwise, the
prefixes are obligatory for transitive verbs but determined on a lexical basis.
   These verbs all encode verbal number, which coincidentally aligns in
Momu with the preferential selection of an inanimate object—a preference
that would not require local person distinctions. Many of the verbs that take
an obligatory object prefix appear to have undergone a shift in semantics
from that which previously did not allow animate or human (and, therefore,
local) objects, to a sense that allows human referents.
   The grammaticalisation pathway for the object prefixes that I propose is
therefore as follows:  1. A verbal form that selects inanimate objects expands to include human
      objects  2. In order to introduce local objects, as ‘show’ was used in serialisation
      as V1 with these verbs. Third person objects were acceptable, however,
      and remained unmarked  3. Over time, the form reduced, with compounding reducing the form by
      removing the final consonant  4. In recognising paradigmatic parallelism of the prefixes, the prefixes
      came to apply optionally to verbs formed by a separate but parallel
      development of verb-forming suﬃxes
6.4     Transitive paradigms
Having established the various forms of argument indexation (§6.2) and the
various ways in which verbs are formed (§6.3), this section briefly exemplifies
what patterns of syncretism look like in full transitive paradigms, beginning
with typical paradigms for high- and low-transitive verbs (§6.4.1, §6.4.2).","[230, 231, 232]"

                                           297
Subjects of transitive verbs are identical: they are the first argument in the
clause and are cross-referenced on the verb in the same manner. Again, the
{S=A} subject cannot be oblique-marked.(8.13) (a) Slupi bekubeku=m nepru.
           Slupi things=obl trans>one:go\3sgS
          ‘Slupi took the things.’
     (b) Slupi yime=m       kafoky-er.
         Slupi man=obl afraid.of-3sgO:vtr[1|3sgS]
         ‘Slupi feared the man.’
     (c) Slupi yime=m       yey-en.
         Slupi man=obl say-3sgO:vtr[1|3sgS]
         ‘Slupi spoke to the man.’
     (d) Slupi yime=m      nuw       sen.
         Slupi man=obl shot.one\3sgS one.dies[1|3sgS]
         ‘Slupi shot the man dead.’A subset of state verbs which select for non-human subjects only have a
third person singular subject form available. (8.14a) is an example of the
(inchoative) verbal counterpart to the adjective motu ‘black’ which can also
function as a predicate, as in (8.15a). A human subject is not possible for
these verbs. An alternate coding strategy of external possession is used
(§10.2.1), where the human possessor is expressed as a topic. This is the
case in (b) where the initial pronoun is an extra-clausal topical possessor.(8.14) (a) Wune muti-ta.
           stone black-inch
          ‘A stone / stones is/are blackened.’
     (b) Te ebsi titi-ta.
         1sg leg painful-inch
         ‘My leg(s) hurt.’
     (c) Kwo feku      kaanu.
         tree branch be.broken
         ‘The branch(es) is(/are) broken.’There are also many non-verbal predicates (§11). Clause-initial position
indicates the subject for all of these constructions. Amongst non-verbal
predicates are various nominal predicates. For instance, attributives are
expressed by adjectival predicates, as in (8.15a), and proprietive predicates                                     298
are expressed by proprietive-marked NPs, as in (8.15b). (8.15c) demonstrates
the only two place non-verbal predicate that I am aware of at this stage in
the analysis. Many non-verbal predicates select for an inanimate subject. In
some cases external possession is used with these predicates as well.(8.15) (a) Wune motu.
           stone black
          ‘The stone is black.’
      (b) Te nwu=bu.
          1sg mustard.flower=prop
          ‘I have mustard flowers.’
      (c) Te nwu                momu.
          1sg mustard.flower neg
          ‘I don’t have mustard flowers.’There is a set of attributive constructions that show an alternate coding of
subject. These constructions describe a human referent as being in an exper-
iential state (happy, sad, sick etc.). These have a basic adjectival predicate
form, like that shown in (8.15a), and alternate coding where the experiencer
and experiential state are linked by a verbal copula. With the animate ex-
istential functioning as a copula, the normal order of subject and predicate
complement are maintained. With the inanimate existential functioning as
a copula, the order of subject and predicate complement is reversed. Thus
the choice of copula determines where the subject is expressed.18
    In (8.16a) the experience emsum ‘good/happy’ is the predicate comple-
ment. By switching the animate existential verb to the inanimate counter-
part in (b), the experiential source then sits in what is otherwise the {S=A}
subject position. This alternate construction has a subtly diﬀerent meaning
whereby the experiencer lacks volitionality over the experience.
(8.16)                                                                        2008.210      (a) Te emsu=m     n-a-ya.
          1sg good=obl px-[impf]anim:there.be-1sgS:nzr
          ‘I am happy.’
      (b) Emsu te=m     n-o-wo.
          good 1sg=obl px-[impf]inan:there.be-3sgS:nzr
          ‘I am lucky.’
  18
     Put another way, the choice of copula could be seen as promoting or demoting the
subject.","[325, 326, 327]"

8.1.1        Generalised argument roles
Bickel (2010), building upon the classic works of Comrie (1978) and Dixon
(1979) defines the following generalised argument roles:5S              ‘sole argument’ of a monovalent predicateA              ‘most actor-like argument’ of a transitive predicateO (or P)       ‘not most actor-like argument’ of a bivalent predicateG              ‘most goal-like or ground-like’ argument to a trivalent verbT              ‘most patient-like’ argument to a trivalent verbThese are intended to be generalised descriptions of the specific semantic
relationship between an argument and predicate, in the tradition of macro-
roles (Foley and Van Valin Jr, 1984) or proto-roles (Dowty, 1991). The single
letter terms clearly come from existing well-recognised terminology but are
not intended to be abbreviations of them (e.g., S is not subject) (Dixon,
1979). They stand instead simply as defined.
        Predicates are paired with arguments and roles are assigned accordingly.
Clauses are compared on the basis of valence. Combining arguments with
predicates via these relational mappings, we see below that common prop-
erties of arguments (via case marking, §8.1.2, argument indexing §8.1.4, and
relative order or position, §8.1.3) across predicate classes (§8.1.4) collapse
certain roles across clauses of diﬀering valence.","[312, 313]"
"15.10.2.1    TimeTime adverbial clauses concern the temporal sequencing of events. In Momu,
this is achieved by several diﬀerent construction types including comitative,
completive and clause linking adverbial constructions (§15.3, §15.4, §15.9).
Backgrounding (§15.5) and absolutive (§15.7) adverbial clauses, while not
primarily about temporal sequencing, can describe events that follow each
other.
   Very “tight” sequences (in the sense of Wälchli (2005)) tend to be ex-
pressed as serial verb constructions in Momu (§13). Looser temporal se-
quences can be expressed by unmarked coordination (§14), and the tem-                                     521
poral nature of that sequencing can be augmented by certain adverbs (§9.5),
usually occurring in the second of a pair of coordinated clauses.
       For temporal sequencing in adverbial clauses, a perfective viewpoint is
used for both main clause and subordinate clause. Completive adverbial
clauses signal nearly co-temporal events (§15.10.2.5). The completive-marked
event is the initiating boundary for the main clause event. As such, the tem-
poral sequencing is close. Comitative adverbial clauses, on the other hand,
signal temporal sequencing that need not be close. Events related by a back-
grounding clause are loosely temporally sequenced (§15.5), but in addition
to this, the background clause is usually relevant to the main clause in some
way (e.g., as a cause). Preliminary analysis of the clause linker =bus is that
it is similarly loose, but what additional meaning it adds is unclear at this
point.
       For completive temporal sequences, it is possible for perfective completive
clauses to temporally precede an imperfective main clause as well. The
equivalent viewpoint aspect for comitative clauses indicates overlap.
       While temporal sequencing of coordination is iconic (i.e., the order of
clauses reflects the order of events), adverbial clauses need not be so. For
both comitative and completive adverbials, when they occur after the main
clause, their sequence is non-iconic.","[549, 550]"

Chapter 13Serial Verb ConstructionsSerial verb constructions (SVCs) are a commonly identified feature of many
Papuan languages (Foley, 1986; Senft, 2008), but have also been identified
in many languages all over the world (Aikhenvald and Dixon, 2006; Durie,
1997). The precise definition of an SVC varies upon consideration of the
finer details, but is generally characterised as two or more verbs occurring in
a single clause, which together describe a ‘single event’ (Aikhenvald, 2006).
   Consider a gradual process of grammaticalisation that begins with the
coordination of several clauses predicated by a relatively open set of verbs.
Frequently repeated combinations of clauses, perhaps involving restricted
classes of verbs, gradually reduce in form over time. In a sequence of clauses
where the subject is held constant, subsequent clauses with zero anaphora
tend towards being just a verb, or object and verb (or verb phrase, if one
prefers). In verb-final languages like Momu, this reduction produces a stack
of verbs at the right edge of the clause with a minimal amount of material
occurring between verbs. The extreme form of this reduction is a tight
and possibly synchronically inseparable complex of verb-like morphs that
comprise a single lexeme. Existing accounts of SVCs include examples of
apparent loose coordination through to tight compounding, making this a
somewhat diﬀuse topic at times.
   Momu is a language with many construction types represented across
the spectrum described above, but I do not refer to all of these constructions
as SVCs. In particular, see §7.5.2 for an example of grammaticalised or
partly grammaticalised aspectual inflections of the kind that have elsewhere
been described as SVCs. See also §14 for a more general consideration of
                                     417
compounding and coordination, which I consider outside of SVCs in Momu.
   A common approach in the analysis of SVCs is to consider the overall
valence of the construction. SVCs are often analysed as cumulatively adding
participants to an event’s frame, with multiple participants taken to attain
argument-like status (e.g. Aikhenvald, 2006; Durie, 1997). However, I follow
others (e.g. Ameka, 2009; Hellwig, 2006), in considering SVCs in Momu to
be the expression of separate case frames. For discussion of participants in
SVCs see §13.3.3.
   After laying out the basics to identify SVCs in Momu in §13.1, I look
at specific SVC types in §13.2. Having identified many of the SVC types, I
look more broadly at both features that are common to all SVCs in Momu,
as well as themes that run through subsets (§13.3).
   All examples of SVCs throughout this chapter are in bold. Many SVCs
show final-segment deletion (§2.5.3) consistent with integration as a single
phonological word. These will be marked as proclitic, with an equals sign
(=). Because this can result in dense morphological detail, I will at times
break these apart with a space. But to be clear, this is not an indicator of a
pause or break. At other times SVCs in Momu show fewer signs of integration
as a single phonological word, but are nevertheless delivered rapidly and
without pause. I have no medial orthographic categories for marking this,
and so these are written as separate forms, and the bolding of SVCs indicate
that these are what I consider to be SVCs.","[444, 445, 446]"

(8.11) Object Marking: none > singular/plural > local object prefix > full
         object markingThese are rough manifestations of the referential hierarchies as given in Bickel
(2010, p410). The non-verbal classes in the scale in (8.9) are almost exclus-
ively the domain of intransitive predicates in Momu. The variation in word
class for intransitive predicates in turn captures variation in coding of anim-
acy, specificity, number and temporal stability (Stassen, 1997). The various
non-verbal predicates are discussed in §11. In §11.12 I examine the variation
in meaning as non-verbal predicates become more verb-like in coding.
       The scale of subject marking in (8.10) starts with the complete absence
of subject marking (on non-verbal, mostly intransitive predicates). “Third
person singular subject marking” is a defective pattern limited to a subset
of intransitive state verbs which select for non-human subjects (§3.1.1.2,
§6.3.1, §11.12.1).15 The coding of verbal number (“singular/plural” in the
scale) sits in the scale because, while not inflectional (§6.6.3), it has the
eﬀect of producing paradigms that are defective for number. The end point
of this scale is full subject marking.
       The scale of object marking in (8.11) begins with transitive verbs that
lack any cross-referencing of objects. Having a regular selectional pattern
for the number of the object signals that the verb is “more transitive” in the
sense argued for by Hopper and Thompson (1980). Verbs that lack any form
of object marking are highly likely to select for inanimate or non-human
objects. In addition to this, the majority of verbs coding verbal number
do so via a derivation that marks them as transitive (§6.5, §6.6.2.3). The
point where local object marking is possible marks not only the beginning of
acceptability of human referents for objects but also a preference for referents
local to the speech act to be indicated.16 The end of the scale is full object
marking (which includes syncretism, §6.4).

      I sometimes refer to the defective subject marking for stative verbs as the “appearance
of third person singular subject marking” because it is diﬃcult to know for sure that this
is the relevant distinction. The final vowel segment on Adjectives is typically rounded
(§2.5.2). Marking of third person singular subjects is indicated by a rounding operation
(§2.5.1.3). Nominalisation is marked by a final -u (§4.9). Thus, many stative verbs have
the surface appearance of a third person singular subject verb, or of an adjective or noun.
   16
      The syncretism of first and second person runs against the general trend in transitive
verbs. The more common pattern is to be syncretic in the local persons of the subject
(Baerman, Brown and Corbett, 2005, pp75–81).","[323, 324]"

in the otherwise unmarked contour expected for the speech act type (§10.3),
possibly with a slight rise at the end of each item (if items are being “listed”),
and possibly with a pause between coordinated elements.
       Variation in intonation corresponds with the tightness of the construction
in that the more marked the change, the looser the coordinated structure.
Orthographically I collapse indications of pausing with intonational breaks
with the use of a comma. Where there is no comma, there may still be a
smaller variation in the intonation. The larger the set of coordinated items,
the larger the eﬀect generally. The more natural15 the combination, the
less likely there is a marked intonational pattern, and the more likely a pair
might appear more compound-like.
       The overall order of presentation in this section corresponds to syntactic
tightness first and foremost. I begin with coordination in and of noun phrases
(§14.2.1.1), and then higher marked forms (§14.2.1.2), and finally I consider
predicate and clausal coordination (§14.2.1.3). Dispersed throughout are
examples of the other factors of “tightness.” Consideration of the semantics
of possession (§14.2.5), and collectivity and simultaneity (§14.2.7) are covered
in a separate sections, but these also include intonational coordination.","[496, 497]"
