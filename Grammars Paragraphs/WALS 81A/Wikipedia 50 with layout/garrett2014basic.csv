Three other common preverbs are worth mentioning here. Two of them, keetkwo and
noo, have time-related meanings; the other, neenee, has a basic spatial meaning.
                                                          Using other preverbs       /       87
8.4.1 Using keetkwo and noo
The preverb keetkwo can be translated “still”, or in combination with a negative “(not)
yet”; examples are in (144).
(144) Examples of keetkwo
      (a) Keetkwo nee cheeweyek’.
          “I’m still hungry.”                                                      JVP 2001 (JB)
      (b) Keetkwo mee ’ue hewechek’.
          “I am not well yet.”                                                           YL 1951    The preverb noo expresses continued activity and can be translated as “keep (doing
something)”. In combination with a negative, it can be translated as “stop (doing some-
thing)”; examples are in (145).
(145) Examples of noo
      (a) Tue noo laay’.
          “He kept going along.”                                                 DW 1907 (ALK)
      (b) Kowecho’ noo chkeyem’.
          “Stop sleeping.” (lit. “Don’t keep sleeping.”)                         OB 1927 (ALK)
8.4.2 Using neenee
The preverb neenee has two main uses. First, it is used for actions that move around, or
events that simultaneously take place, in a variety of places; “about” or “around” is often a
good translation. Examples with verbs that are consistent with motion appear in (146).
(146) Examples of neenee “(going) around”
      (a) Wee’ neenee kepoyuerek’.
          “I swim about at random.”                                               MM 1927 (ES)
      (b) Kolo wee’ neenee hak’ws.
          “She was kind of laughing around there.”                                 FS 1951 (YL)With verbs that are inconsistent with motion, as in (147), the meaning of neenee is that
multiple subjects or multiple objects are located in a variety of places.
(147) Examples of neenee “(multiple subjects or objects being) around”
      (a) Wee’ neenee rek’eeen ’ue-kahchuuem’.
          “They’re sitting around sewing.”                               FS 1980 (PP)
      (b) To’ cho’ neenee neee’nowom’.
          “You should look around.”                                    DW 1906 (ALK)   Second, neenee expresses comparison and can be translated “more”, as in (148).
(148) Comparative neenee
      (a) Cho’ neenee plerrsem’.
          “Talk louder.”                                                           FS 1951 (YL)
      (b) Nek neenee chey ’o kel’.
          “I am younger than you.”                                                       YL 1951Note that even though the best translation may involve an English adjective (louder,
younger), Yurok neenee is a preverb.
Chapter 9Sentence patterns9.1 Basic word order
Yurok word order is ﬂexible. It is often possible to arrange the words in the same sen-
tence in two or more different ways, all of them quite acceptable. The order that speakers
choose may depend more on emphasis and the nature of their conversation or story than
on purely syntactic rules. But several clear patterns can be noted here.","[117, 118, 119, 120]"

5.6      Using collective and non-collective plurals
The most important practical rule governing the use of collectives is that if a verb has a
collective, that is what is usually used when the subject is plural. From nepek’ “I eat”, for

  9.3       Questions
  Questions are of the following two types:
• In a yes–no question, there are only a couple of natural answers. For example, the
  likely answers to the English question Will you help me? are either Yes or No (or some
  expansion or equivalent).
• In a content question, the range of likely answers is broader. For example, given the
  English question Who will help me?, there are numerous possible answers depending
  on the circumstances: Alice, Bert, Charlie, Donna, etc.
  In many languages, yes–no questions and content questions are formed in different
  ways. In English, for example, content questions use a word such as where?, what?,
  why?, etc., while yes–no questions are formed by changing word order: Can you hear
  me? Yurok too has two different methods for forming the two types of questions.",[123]
"9.1.1 Preverbs and adverbs
One obvious pattern is that preverbs come before the verb; this is why they are called
pre-verbs. For example, in (149), with preverbs in boldface and verbs underlined:
(149) Preverb position
      (a) Keech ho nep’ puuek.
           “He’s been eating deer.”                                          MM 1927 (ES)
      (b) Ha’aag keech mehl ho retkah.
           “You’ve made a wall with rocks.”                                   FS 1980 (PP)In contrast, adverbs, even those with generally similar meanings, may be positioned
before or after verbs. For example, in (150), the adverbs chmeyaan “yesterday”, ’owook
“tomorrow”, and wonekw “above” occupy a position before the verb (and before the pre-
verbs) in two sentences, and after the verb in two others.
(150) Adverb position
      (a) Wonekw ’o soonekw kue laas.
          “The trail goes uphill.”                                          GM 2003 (AQ)

          “Yesterday I came from Crescent City.”                                  YL 1951

          “The man chased an elk yesterday.”                                      YL 1951
      (d) Kee lahchue’ so Kohpey ’owook.
          “A voyage will be made to Crescent City tomorrow.”                      YL 1951Preverbs never show the word order ﬂexibility of adverbs.
 90        /       Sentence patterns
 9.1.2 Nouns and verbs
 It is uncommon for a sentence in ordinary usage to have more than one noun, and it is
 common for sentences to have no nouns. If there is a noun, it may be positioned either
 before or after its verb. As a rule, no more than one noun will be positioned before the
 verb. Any others will be positioned after the verb, and it is even possible that all nouns
 will be positioned after the verb.
      If one noun at most is positioned before the verb, which noun is it? When are nouns
 positioned before their verbs? Two general rules about noun position are given in (151).¹
 (151)     Noun position: Two general rules
           (a) A noun is usually before the verb if it is contrastive, emphasized, or new
               to the discourse.
           (b) A noun is usually after the verb if it conveys old information, or if it is
               very long.
 The rule in (151a) is illustrated in (152), consecutive sentences from a single story.
 These sentences have a series of three contrasting subjects: (a) everyone, (b) kue lochom’
 “the toad”, and (c) kue negeneech “the mouse”.
 (152)     (a) ’Eekee toom’ nue hlkeeegor.
               “Everyone went to watch.”
           (b) Kwesee kue lochom’ ’o ges’, Nek kem kue hlkyorkwek’.
               “And the toad thought, “I too will go watch.”
           (c) Kue negeneech tue’ kem wee’ ’o gegok’w.
               “The mouse too was staying there.”                                                  FS 1951 (YL) Each of the two contrasting nouns is positioned before its verb; the verbs are underlined
 and the preverbal nouns are in boldface.²
     The rule in (151b) is illustrated in (153), a set of sentences that come later in the
 story quoted in (152). When the toad and mouse are mentioned again they are already
 known, so the position of the noun is after the verb.
 (153)     (a) Kwesee yem’ kue negeneech . . .
               “Then the mouse said . . .”
           (b) Kwesee ’o te’noy’ kue lochom’ . . .
               “And the toad was annoyed . . .”
           (c) Kwesee wee’ neenee noo’s kue negeneech.
               “And the mouse giggled around.”                                                     FS 1951 (YL) In each case the (boldface) noun follows rather than preceding the (underlined) verb.","[120, 121]"
"Classical Yurok. This term refers to the usage of Yurok speakers recorded in the ﬁrst
     half or two thirds of the 20th century, those born before about 1900–1910. (These
     include Lowana Brantner, Florence Shaughnessy, Robert Spott, and many other
     people.)
Modern Yurok. This term refers to the usage of Yurok speakers recorded late in the
     20th century and early in the 21st century, those born after about 1900–1910.
     (These include the most active teachers of the last generation.)TerminologyYou do not need to know special terminology to speak a language. Yurok children learned
their language perfectly, and elders spoke masterfully and subtly in the language, for
centuries with no linguists. But linguistic terminology is helpful if you want to talk about
the structure or the use of a language.1st, 2nd, 3rd person. Verbs have ﬁrst-, second-, and third-person forms: 1st person
      means that the subject is “I” or “we”; 2nd person means that the subject is “you”
      (singular or plural); and 3rd person means that the subject is “he”, “she”, “it”, or
      “they”.
Impersonal verb. An impersonal verb is a verb that has no subject; the usual imper-
      sonal verbs concern weather and other situations that need not involve any par-
      ticipants. See §2.1 on page 17. A Yurok example is tenpewe’hl “it is raining”.
Intransitive verb. An intransitive verb is a verb that has a subject but no object. See
      §2.1 on page 17. An English example is walk; a Yurok example is ro’opek’ “I run”.
Noun. See §2.3 on page 19.
xx     /      Glossary
Object. Some verbs have an object as well as a subject; the object is the person or thing
     affected or targeted by the action. In English, for example, that rock is the object
     in the sentences I saw that rock and I threw that rock.
Plural. A plural noun or verb refers to more than one person or thing (in the case of
     verbs, usually the subject but occasionally the object).
Preﬁx. A preﬁx is a piece of a longer word that is added to the beginning of the word,
     such as English un- in unhappy) or Yurok ’ne- in ’ne-’yoch “my boat”.
Singular. A singular noun or verb refers to one person or thing (in the case of verbs,
     usually the subject but occasionally the object).
Subject. Almost every verb has a subject: the person or thing that does the action,
     or that experiences or undergoes the state expressed by the verb. In English, for
     example, that rock is the subject in the sentences Yesterday that rock fell on my car
     and That rock was big.
Suﬃx. A suﬃx is a piece of a longer word that is added to the end of the word, such as
     English -ness in happiness or Yurok -ek’ in skewokseemek’ “I like it”.
Transitive verb. A transitive verb is a verb that requires an object and a subject. See
     §2.1 on page 17. An English example is see; a Yurok example is newook’ “I see it”.
Verb. See §2.1 on page 17.","[26, 27]"
"  2.1 Verbs
  Verbs in the broad sense actually consist of two distinct word classes.
       A verb (in the narrow sense) is a kind of word that changes its form depending on
  its subject (and possibly its object), and that prototypically expresses an activity or state.
  English verbs include know, run, sing. A Yurok verb that changes form is illustrated by
  the following selection of forms:
• komchuemek’ “I know it”
• komchuem’ “he or she knows it”
• komchuechek’ “I know you”
• komchuepa’ “you know me”
• komchuesek’ “I know her or him”      A non-inflected verb is a kind of verb (in the broad sense) that does not change
  form; it is not “inﬂected” according to the subject. For example, without changing form,
  the Yurok non-inﬂected verb skewok “like, want” can be used in expressions like nek ske-
  wok “I want”, kel’ skewok “you want”, or yo’ skewok “he or she wants”. For more information
  see §5.2.

     Both inﬂected and non-inﬂected verbs can be classiﬁed according to transitivity,
  which refers to the number of obligatory participants implied by their meaning. The
  options can be summarized as follows.
• An intransitive verb has a subject but no object. Yurok examples are kepoyuerek’ “I
  swim” and knewolepek’ “I am tall”.
• A transitive verb has a subject and an object. Yurok examples are ko’moyok’ “I hear it”
  and nooluemek’ “I love her or him”.
• A ditransitive verb has a subject and two objects. These verbs usually refer to giving
  or transfer, where one object is the thing given and the other is the recipient (the person
  to whom it is given). A Yurok example is nahchek’ “I give it to her or him”.
• An impersonal verb has no subject or object. These verbs usually refer to the weather
  or similar situations. A Yurok example is rook’ws “it’s windy”.
      For more information about Yurok verbs see chapters 5–6 and 11–25.","[48, 49, 50]"
" 6.1.2 Using passives
 The term basic subject may be useful to avoid ambiguity in referring to the subject of
 a non-passive verb.² For example, the basic subject of newook’ “I see it” and newoyek’ “I¹ Note that passive forms like hohkelek’ need not have the unlikely meaning “somebody made or repaired me”
  (as if spoken by a boat or house); they could be used in a causative construction with meanings like “somebody
  made me (do something)”. For this construction see §12.2 on page 121.
² Linguists might use the term underlying subject.

used when the basic subject is unknown or of no special interest in context.(50)     (a)   Keech ho’omohtkoyek’.
               “I’ve been hurt.”                                                          FS 1980 (PP)
         (b) Neekee markwsewee’.
             “They were all killed.”                                                      FS 1980 (PP)

             “Something was being dragged along there.”                                   FS 1951 (YL)   In cases like (51), the basic subject is known but the focus of attention is the partic-
ipant who is affected by the action. This is especially common for plural basic subjects
that might be translated as “they” or “people” (in general).(51)     (a)   Hesem’ hes newoyem’?
               “Do you think they see you?”
               (lit. “Do you think you were seen?”)                                       AF 2001 (JB)
         (b) Keech syaahlkoyem’ hes?

52      /      Additional verb types
   As illustrated in (52), passives are also sometimes used when the basic subject is
overtly expressed — kue puesee “that cat” in (52a) and kue meges “the doctor” in (52b).
Typically, in such cases the focus of attention is not the basic subject but the participant
who is affected by the action.
(52)    (a) Newook’ kue puesee sesomenoyem’.
            “I saw that cat scratch you.”

            (lit. “I am being treated with medicine (by) the doctor.”)         AG 2007 (AG)6.2     Bipersonal verbs
While the verbs discussed above have endings that indicate the subject, Yurok also has
verbs with endings that indicate both the subject and the object. These are called biper-
sonal verbs, and can be used when the object of the verb refers to a person (or an animal
behaving like a person, for example in a story). Examples are in (53–54). The verbs in
(53) all end in -chek’ and involve a subject “I” and an object “you”, such as ko’moyochek’
“I hear you” in (53a).
(53)    (a) Nek ko’moyochek’.
            “I heard you.”                                                      AF 2001 (JB)

laayoluepa’ “you teach me”.
(54)    (a) Skuy’ soo laayoluepa’.
            “You teach me well.”                                                JJ 2006 (AG)
        (b) Cho’ chpeenahpeepa’ ’owookpaa!
            “Wait for me until the day after tomorrow.”                             YL 1951Generally, if a verb’s object is a person — “me, you, her, him, us, them” — then a biper-
sonal form is usually used. Some speakers use them regularly only in examples like
(53–54) where “I” and “you” are involved, especially in Modern Yurok, but most speak-
ers use a broad range of bipersonal forms as appropriate. Full bipersonal paradigms of
numerous individual verbs are given throughout chapters 14–24.","[81, 82, 83]"

 6.5 Attributive verbs
 Every inﬂected Yurok verb has attributive forms. These have distinctive endings and a
 set of uses that sometimes correspond to modiﬁers in English, sometimes to nouns, and
 sometimes to phrases with meanings like “the one who steals” or “the boy who ran fast”.
 The attributive phrases that are formed with attributive verbs can be understood
 informally as descriptive phrases; they serve to characterize or describe a noun or a
 referent under discussion.¹
     The most common patterns for forming attributive verbs are shown in Table 6.8.                                                              o-class or                oo-class
                        e-class             e-class           oo-class                  (3 sg -ok’w)                 1 sg   komchuemoh          nepoh             megetohlkwoh              sootoh

                 1 pl   komchuemoh          nepoh             megetohlkwoh
                 2 pl   komchuemueh         nepueh            megetohlkwoomom

             2 coll                         nepee’mow’                                  le’mow’

                        “know it”           “eat”             “take care of it”         “go, leave”                                 Table 6.8: Attributive verb paradigms As the table shows, all ﬁrst-person (singular and plural) attributives have an ending
 -oh, similar to the 1 pl ending of indicative verbs. Second-person attributives distin-
 guish singular and plural endings, and have different patterns for e-class vs. o- and oo-
 class verbs. Note that oo-class verbs with 3 sg forms in -ok’w have 3 sg attributives in
 -okween. Collective ﬁrst- and second-person attributives are identical to indicatives; the
 third-person forms are distinct.
     By far the most common attributive forms in use are third-person forms (singular,
 plural, and collective). Their use to modify nouns is illustrated in (61–62). Given ﬁrst,
 in (61), are examples with the pattern Attributive + Noun.² (61)      Attributive + Noun
           (a)     kerkue’yermercheen laayekws
                   “a crooked trail” (kerkue’yermercherk’ “I walk crookedly”)                       FS 1980 (PP)
           (b) nuemee peleen leyes
               “a very big snake” (peloyek’ “I am big”)                                             AF 2001 (JB)
¹ Attributive verbs are used to form what linguists call relative clauses. A relative clause that consists of only
  an attributive verb can function like an agent noun, the equivalent of English baker, hunter, etc. Note that
  a number of details of attributive formation and usage are omitted here. More information can be found in
  R. H. Robins’s The Yurok language (1958) and Howard Berman’s “Subordinate clauses in Yurok: A preliminary
  report” (1972); for full references see the Bibliography on page 299.
² Note that che’lonee in (61c) is strictly speaking a passive attributive, as che’lee’ is passive.

            “the people who lived there” (’ook’ “I am (in a place)”)          FS 1986 (JP)   In (62) are examples with the pattern Noun + kue + Attributive. These examples
do not clearly show it, but in general the pattern in (62) is used for longer or more
complex attributive phrases. The pattern in (61) tends to be used for shorter or one-
word attributive phrases.

            “the man who fell down” (lekolek’ “I fall”)                            YL 1951    Given in (63) are examples of a pattern in which the attributive form (not modifying
a noun) is interpreted as “one who does” whatever the verb refers to. Since they refer to
the subjects of verbs, these can be called subject attributive phrases.
(63)    Subject attributive phrases

² In addition, in Classical Yurok, what are called comitative forms in R. H. Robins’s book The Yurok language

ten, but they are appropriate when the speaker wishes to imply a contrast with someone
else. Examples are in (22–23). In (22), the contrastive pronouns are subjects.

with third-person subjects. As seen in (27), however, plural pronouns like nekah “we,
us” are used in this context.

4.1.2 Demonstrative pronouns
Demonstrative pronouns refer either to animals, things, or places (like English it, that,
this, here, there), or to people other than the speaker or addressee (like English he, she,
they). Yurok has an elaborate system of demonstrative pronouns in comparison with
English; here only the main pronouns that can be used for people will be mentioned.
These are summarized in Table 4.2.                                       singular         plural                           proximal    wo’ or wo’oot    wo’hlkoh
                            neutral    yo’ or yo’oot    yo’hlkoh                      Table 4.2: Selected demonstrative pronounsIn the singular column, wo’ and yo’ are more common short forms of wo’oot and yo’oot,
respectively, but the short and long forms have the same basic meaning.
    The difference between the proximal and neutral forms is as follows. Proximal
forms refer to someone (or something) who is nearby, or relatively close, especially if
contrasted with someone (or something) farther away. Neutral forms refer to someone
(or something) that is absent or farther away, or in contexts when no particular distance
is implied. Because neutral forms are used when no particular distance is implied, they
are far more common; they are used for “he, she, him, her, they, them” in most instances.
    Examples of proximal demonstratives in sentences are in (28).
(28)    Proximal demonstrative examples
        (a) Wo’ tue’ skewok kee k’e-tegerew.
             “He (this person) wants to talk to you.”                           JJ 2007 (LC)
        (b) Mos wo’oot, nek wee’ serrhl.
             “Not him (this person), I did it.”                                 AF 2001 (JB)Examples of neutral demonstratives in sentences are in (29).

"  2.3 Nouns
  A noun is a kind of word that can be the subject or object of a verb, or the object of a
  preposition; nouns typically refer to people, places, things, events, substances, or qual-
  ities. English nouns include boy, creek, boat, water, and happiness; Yurok nouns include
  mewah “young boy”, raak “creek”, and ’yoch “boat”. (Abstract concepts tend to be expressed
  as verbs in Yurok, not nouns.) For more information about Yurok nouns see chapter 3.",[50]

"  2.4 Pronouns
  A pronoun is a kind of word that stands in place of a noun. It may be the subject or object
  of a verb, for example, but its reference may differ from sentence to sentence, depending
  on context. English pronouns include words like me, that, and what. Yurok pronouns are
  of three types:
• personal pronouns refer to “I”, “you”, “me”, etc.: nek, kel’, nekah, kelew, etc.
• demonstrative pronouns refer to a third person, that is, “s/he”, “that one”, “them”, etc.:
  yo’, wee’eeet, etc.
• question (or interrogative) pronouns include words like kues “how?”, tee’now “who?”,
  tee’neeshoo “what?”, and other words in forming content questions (§9.3.2).
20      /      Word classes
For some additional information about Yurok personal and demonstrative pronouns see
chapter 4; question pronouns are discussed in §9.3.","[50, 51]"
"
  Grammatical description  Non-inﬂected verbs are identiﬁed as such. For other verbs, verb class (e-class, aa-class,
  o-class, or oo-class) is identiﬁed. For information about non-inﬂected verbs, see §5.2 on
  page 38 above. For information about verb classes, see §5.3–§5.4 beginning on page 40.
      For oo-class verbs, the 3rd person singular ending (-ok’w, -om’, or -o’) is identiﬁed.
  For information about these endings, see §5.3 beginning on page 40.
      Finally, impersonal verbs are identiﬁed as such. For all other verbs, transitivity status
  (intransitive, transitive, or optionally transitive) is identiﬁed. These terms are deﬁned
  here:
• intransitive. An intransitive verb has only a subject, and no object; for these terms see
  the Glossary beginning on page xix. Examples are English run and Yurok ro’opek’ “I run”.
• transitive. A transitive verb has both a subject and an object. Examples are English see
  and Yurok newook’ “I see it”.
• ditransitive. A ditransitive verb has a subject and two objects. Most ditransitive verbs
  are verbs of transfer, like English give (for example, I gave her a book, with two objects
  her and a book). A Yurok ditransitive verb is nahchek’ “I give it to her/him”.
• optionally transitive. An optionally transitive verb can be intransitive or transitive.
  These are rare in Yurok.
• impersonal. An impersonal verb is one that has no subject; the event referred to hap-
  pens without an expressed agent, cause, experiencer, or other participant. Examples are
  English rain (it’s raining) and Yurok tenpewe’hl “it’s raining”.
  See also the Glossary of terminology and symbols, beginning on page xix.

Closely related verbs are sometimes shown. This means other verbs derived from the
same root, but differing in form, meaning, or usage. This will often include non-inﬂected
verbs. Examples of groups of closely related verbs include the verbs in (203) and the
verbs in (204). Within these groups, non-inﬂected megetohl in (203) and myah in (204)
are the most common individual forms. You will ﬁnd them listed under megetohlkwook’
(page 274) and myaahlkepek’ (page 229).

Information about how a verb is used, and what it means, is always given, with example
sentences.","[144, 145]"

Special symbols† A dagger or obelisk marks phrases or sentences that are unacceptable to ﬂuent speak-
     ers of a language; you cannot say them. For example, in English †Man the is old is
     impossible. Similarly, in Yurok, because a preverb like ’ochkaa must precede the
     verb, you cannot say †Kepoyuerek’ ’ochkaa.
* An asterisk marks Yurok expressions that are almost certainly possible, but that do
     not happen to be documented in recordings of speakers.
AcknowledgementsWe would not know what we know about Yurok without the patient work of ﬂuent
speakers who never stopped teaching their language. I had the good fortune to learn
from ’aawokw Aileen Figueroa, Jimmie James, Glenn Moore, Sr., Archie Thompson, and
Georgiana Trull. I have also spent many hours listening to, and reading transcripts of,
the voices of other Yurok speakers, including the elders of a century and longer ago;
those of the mid-twentieth century, such as Lowana Brantner, Frank Douglas, Florence
Shaughnessy, Alice Spott, and Robert Spott; and many others. All of them generously
shared their knowledge so their language can endure with its people.
    Also essential have been linguists of earlier generations who worked with ﬂuent
speakers to document Yurok, carefully studied aspects of its grammar, and published
valuable analyses of its patterns. The most important of these linguists is R. H. Robins,
whose book The Yurok language (1958) contains key observations on every page; this
book makes constant use of what he learned from Florence Shaughnessy and other
Yurok elders. Also invaluable is the work of Howard Berman, A. L. Kroeber, Paul Proulx,
Edward Sapir, and T. T. Waterman. These scholars created a lasting analytic framework
for the study of Yurok grammar.
    This book is intended for members of the Yurok community — language learners and
teachers — and is a direct result of their support and inspiration. Participants in the Yurok
Language Institute and grammar workshops have made helpful comments and sugges-
tions on grammar, handouts, and drafts of part of this book; they include Tammy Cairns,
Leo Canez, Georgiana Gensaw, Robert R. Kinney, Kate Lowry, Skip Lowry, Chelsea
Reed, Margo Robbins, Bessie Shorty, Britty Vigil, Lawrence Williams, and others. The
Yurok Tribe language program staff over the years — Victoria Carlson, James Gensaw,
Barbara McQuillen, Kathleen Vigil, and their colleagues and interns — are good friends
and engaging teachers. Long-time Yurok language teacher Kay Inong has played an im-
portant role in creating a language curriculum that informs the choice of topics covered
in this book. The Yurok Tribe language program poy ’we-son, Carole Lewis, deserves spe-
cial mention for her hard work and long-term vision in creating a program that inspires
communities throughout California. Thanks also to activist, artist, and Yurok language
teacher Annelia Hillman for kindly contributing original artwork to this book.
    Without two friends who changed my career, I would never have worked with the
Yurok language. Leanne Hinton introduced me to California language documentation
and revitalization, and has offered unstinting support. Juliette Blevins introduced me to
Yurok itself, persuaded me that a philologist could play a role in the community, and
talked with me for years about the grammar of the language. I am forever grateful to

    My colleagues Lisa Conathan, James Martin, Line Mikkelsen, Alysoun Quinby, Ruth
Rouvier, Justin Spence, and Tess Wood have greatly improved my understanding of
Yurok grammar with ideas and work that have made a difference throughout this book.

PrefaceThis book is meant to be used by Yurok language teachers and advanced learners, in
support of language restoration in the Yurok community. That goal has determined the
contents and style of what follows. Linguists and other scholars may ﬁnd this useful
as well, but should be aware that it is not an academic reference grammar. All readers
should keep in mind that languages are best learned by speaking and listening; this is a
supplement to the spoken language.
    This is a combination, expansion, and revision of two earlier publications, Yurok verb
guide: 75 common verbs (2009, 78 pages) and Basic Yurok grammar (2010, 69 pages).
Those earlier books are completely superseded by this one; substantial content has been
added and signiﬁcant errors have been corrected.
    Part I (chapters 1–10) provides information about the sounds of Yurok and about
basic grammatical and vocabulary patterns. Many were identiﬁed by the Yurok Tribe
for teacher certiﬁcation purposes. Part II (chapters 11–25) introduces the meanings and
forms of the most common Yurok verbs. Over 200 different verbs are covered, in 117
numbered sections. Because Yurok verbs tend to pack more information into them than
English verbs, Yurok verbs usually have many different forms, indicating participants
in the action and sometimes also relations to other verbs in the sentence. Some Yurok
verbs have dozens of different forms. This makes a guide useful.
    Other grammatical topics are discussed only brieﬂy (such as some of the preverbs),
or are omitted entirely (such as reﬂexive and reciprocal verbs, locative forms of nouns,
and many sentence patterns). Advanced learners and teachers may consult R. H. Robins’s
1958 book The Yurok language: Grammar, texts, lexicon, written in a technical style for
linguists, and other linguistic publications. See the Bibliography on pages 299–300 for
details.","[27, 28, 29, 30]"
"
¹ As the examples in (19) on page 29 show, when short forms of nouns are used, the article is typically omitted:
  ’ne-lew vs. kue ’ne-lewet “my net”.
  Chapter 5  Basic verb formation  Broadly speaking, Yurok verbs are of two types:
• non-inflected verbs do not change their form depending on the subject or object. They
  are described in §5.2.
• inflected verbs, do change their form, depending on whether their subjects are ﬁrst
  person (“I, we”), second person (“you”), etc. They require much more discussion.
  Every inﬂected verb belongs to one of four verb classes. The four classes are named
  according to the vowel that sometimes appears before the ending:
• e-class verbs
• o-class verbs
• oo-class verbs
• aa-class verbs  All four classes are described here in general terms. For details about individual verbs,
  consult Part II beginning on page 113 below. This includes information about usage and
  the forms of many common verbs. In general, when you learn a verb, you should learn
  its class (and its subclass if it is an oo-class verb), whether its usual plural is collective,
  whether it has any irregular forms, and its usage patterns.","[67, 68]"
"          Table 10.1: Selected numerals from 1 to 10 (q = question “How many?”)
10.3           Numerals and color terms
Words used for counting things (“one”, “two”, etc.) and words used to describe colors
(“light-colored”, “red”, etc.) are mostly verbs in Yurok. (Recall that Yurok, unlike English,
does not have any adjectives.) The most commonly-used forms are attributive verbs
and non-inflected verbs.
     A distinctive feature of Yurok numerals and color terms is that they change form
depending on the meaning of what they are applied to; a different form of “two” or “light-
colored” is used for snakes and for human beings. This is a classificatory system; it
is how Yurok organizes phenomena in the world. Numerals show more different forms
than color terms in Yurok, but both are classiﬁcatory.",[137]
"
 6.1 Passive verbs
 Most transitive verbs (verbs that have objects as well as subjects) have a set of pas-
 sive forms.¹ These can be used to indicate that the speaker does not know who the
 (ordinary) subject of the verb is, or does not care, or generally that the discourse is
 oriented toward the object and not the subject. Yurok passives are broadly equivalent to
 English sentences like I was hit with a rock or Mistakes were made, but often the best
 translation is “somebody did (the verbal action)”.",[80]

        (a)   Tee’now puen’?

tee’neeshoo questions are used with verbs that ordinarily have a noun as their (missing)
subject or object. In (165c), the missing noun is understood with mehl “about”.",[126]
"Inﬂected forms

Chapter 25Verbs of weather and timeThe verbs in this chapter refer to types of weather or events. They are called imper-
sonal because their subjects cannot be people, animals, etc. (a person cannot rain or be
windy); they only have 3 sg forms.
     One or two surprising features of impersonal verbs are illustrated in this chapter.
First, impersonal verbs have subjunctive forms may surprise learners, because they
seem to contain 1 sg endings (as if they meant “I am bad weather”, etc.). This is simply
a consequence of how subjunctives are formed. Second, as illustrated for ror’ “it snows”,
it is possible for an impersonal verb to have an impersonal passive.
294        /      Verbs of weather and time
25.1           Roo “be a (certain) time”
Grammatical description: intransitive non-inﬂected verb
Related verbs
      • rootah “sun shines (to somewhere)” (non-inﬂected)
      • rootep’ “it is a (particular) time”
Meaning and usage
As shown in (402a), roo can be used without a complement expressing what it is time
for. When a complement is present, as in (402b–c), a subjunctive verb is used.
(402)     (a) Kues keech roo?
              “What time is it?”                                                 YL 1951
          (b) Keech ’ee roo kee ’we-’e’gah.
              “It’s time for them to eat.”                                GT 2003 (YLCB)
          (c) Keech ’ee roo kue k’e-kepoyuerek’.
              “It is time for you to go swimming.”                               YL 1951The verb roo is a shorter form of non-inﬂected rootah (and inﬂected rootep’), which con-
veys a very similar meaning in examples like the following:
(403)     Kues rootah?
          “Where is the sun shining to?”                                     FS 1980 (PP)Traditionally, time measurement would have been by the angle of the sun and the length
of shadows. In effect, therefore, the sentence in (403) asks what time it is.

25.2       Snow, wind, and hail
The non-inﬂected verb sahksah in (404) refers to hail.
(404) Noohl ’o sahksah.
      “Then the hail comes.”                                                      FS 1980 (PP)Verbs that refer generally to wind and snow have a variety of forms. For wind, the basic
verb is rookws’ “it’s windy” (subjunctive ’we-rookwsek’, undocumented attributive rook-
wseen), which has a related non-inﬂected form rookw. These forms are illustrated in
(405).
(405)   (a) Neemee nuemee rook’ws ’o wee’eeet.
            “It’s not very windy here.”                                           FS 1980 (PP)
        (b) Neeko’hl ’we-rookwsek’ ’o wee’eeet.
            “It’s always windy here.”                                             FS 1980 (PP)
        (c) Neeko’hl ’we-rookw.
            “It’s always windy.”                                                  FS 1980 (PP)For snow, the basic verb is ror’ (subjunctive ’we-rorek’ and attributive roreen), illustrated
in (406).
(406)   (a) Ho ror’.
            “It’s been snowing.”                                                GM 2004 (AG)
        (b) Keech ror’.
            “It’s snowing, it’s just now beginning to snow.”                   GT 2003 (YLCB)Perhaps surprisingly, this impersonal verb ror’ “it’s snowing” has an impersonal passive
form roree’ “there is snow”, illustrated in (407).
(407) Keech roree’.
      “It’s snowing.”                                                          GT 2003 (YLCB)

Grammatical description: intransitive oo-class verb (3 sg -ok’w)Meaning and usage
This verb means “come”, expressing motion toward what linguists call the deictic cen-
ter — the speaker, or whatever location is contextually understood as a central reference
point. Examples are in (337).
(337)   (a) To’ kee kem wenook’.
            “I will come again.”                                                  LT 1922 (GR)

bial or noun phrase.
(338)   (a) Neskwee keech wenok’w.
            “He is coming near.”                                                       YL 1951

Chapter 22Verbs of perception and
thinkingThe following verbs are described in this chapter:    chpa’royok’ “I listen” (p. 240)              ko’moyok’ “I hear it” (p. 246)
    chperwerkseemek’ “I remember him”            neee’nek’ “I look at it” (p. 250)
      (p. 241)                                   neee’nowok’ “I watch it” (p. 251)
    hesek’ “I think” (p. 243)                    nekomuykook’ “I know how” (p. 254)
    hlkyorkwek’ “I watch it” (p. 245)            newook’ “I see it” (p. 255)
    komchuemek’ “I know it” (p. 248)             soosek’ “I think (so)” (p. 258)The most general verbs of thinking are hesek’ “I think” and soosek’ “I think (so)”, which
differ in that hesek’ highlights the content of a thought and soosek’ highlights the type
of thought. The four main perception verbs above can be classiﬁed as shown in the fol-
lowing table:                           source-oriented            experiencer-oriented               hearing     ko’moyok’    “I hear it”   chpa’royok’   “I listen”
               sight       newook’      “I see it”    neee’nek’     “I look at it”In each modality — hearing and sight — there is a source-oriented verb as well as an
experiencer-oriented verb. The source-oriented verb highlights the source of the sound
or sight; you do not usually choose whether to hear or see something. The experiencer-
oriented verb highlights the activity of the subject, who can try to listen or look at some-
thing of interest. The English translations also convey the same meaning.

Grammatical description: optionally transitive o-class verb
Related verb
      • chpegar’ “hear” (non-inﬂected iterative; also functions as a noun “ear”)
Meaning and usage
This verb means “I listen”, with a meaning like that of its Engilsh translation. An example
with no overt object is in (339).
(339)     Kel’ cho’ chpa’royom’.
          “You should listen (to me).”                                               JVP 2001 (JB)What the subject listens to can be expressed as a subjunctive phrase, as in (340).
(340)     (a) Yo’hlkoh chpa’royohl ’ne-chwegeen.
              “They listen to me talk.”                                           GT 2003 (YLCB)
          (b) Cho’ nuemee chpa’royom’ k’ee nekee’ soch.
              “Listen carefully to what I say.”                                      FS 1951 (YL)Perhaps unexpectedly, the iterative chpega’royok’ means “I ask, I inquire, I question”, as
in (341).
(341)     Noohl ’o chpega’roy’ kue ’ne-psech ho kue meweemor.
          “Then my father asked (lit. to) the old man.”                              FS 1951 (YL)
Verbs with similar meanings
The verb ko’moyok’ “I hear it” (page 246) differs in that chpa’royok’ is experiencer-oriented
while ko’moyok’ is source-oriented (see page 239).","[267, 268, 269, 270, 271]"

¹ The term for gray hair (possibly related to the word k’yow “swan”, since immature swans are grayish) is included
  because it probably has other forms which are not yet documented. It is also very possible that all the terms
  in the animals column in Table 10.4 could refer to hair color.
  Part IIBasic verbs
  Chapter 11  Verb overview  Chapters 12–25 present detailed information concerning over 200 Yurok verbs. All are
  common; many are essential in everyday speech. They were chosen because of their
  frequency or importance in language use. The verbs included are also organized by verb
  class in Tables 11.1–11.4 on pages 116–117.
      Beginning in chapter 12, each chapter lists the most common verbs in a single area
  of meaning. Several types of information are given for each verb, as follows.","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144]"
" 10.2.1         Verbs in no’om- “how long”
 Verbs that begin with the relative root no’om- answer (or ask) the question “how long?”
 They typically refer to a distance, as in the examples in (189), where ’oteesh “a foot (in
 length)” and k’e-yah “your belly” indicate the length.
 (189)     (a) ’Oteesh no’omel’.
               “It was a foot long.”                                                           FS 1951 (YL)
           (b) Mocho kee wohpeyem’, kwesee k’e-yah kee no’omuel’.
               “If you cross, then it (the water) will be up to your belly.”                   FS 1980 (PP) As (190) shows, the distance can be in time as well as space.
 (190)     ’Owook kerrmeek’ kee no’omuen’.
           “Tomorrow he will be nine years old.”                                              VM 1994 (BJ)
 10.2.2         Verbs in son- “how”
 Verbs that begin with the relative root son- (or its variants sern-, soo-, or serr-) answer
 (or ask) the question “how?” They refer to a manner of being or doing, and must be
 used with a word or phrase that expresses the manner. For example, as in (191), the
 verb serrnerh “be (a particular) color, it is colored (thus)” requires an expression like
 won “differently”.
 (191)     Won nee kee serrnerh k’e-wa’aw.
           “Your ﬂoor will be a different color.”                                              JJ 2006 (AG) In the common expression in (192), skuy’ “good” likewise expresses manner with the
 verb soneenepek’ “I feel (a particular way)”.
 (192)     Skuy’ soneenepek’.
           “I feel good.”                                                                      JJ 2006 (AG) And the verb soonekw “go (in a particular direction, of a trail)” in (193) requires an ex-
 pression like pechkue “upriver” to express the direction.
 (193)     Pechkue soonekw kue laas.
           “The trail goes upriver.”                                                         GM 2004 (AG)¹ Linguists who study the Algonquian languages use this term because the meaning of elements like son-, tom-,
  or weno’om- is said to relate to the additional element in the sentence.

10.2.3        Verbs in tom- “how much”
Verbs that begin with the relative root tom- answer (or ask) the question “how much?”
They typically refer to an amount or quantity, and require an amount expression or a
place-holder like kues “how (much)?” or wek “this”. Examples of tomoyek’ “I am (a par-
ticular age or size)” are given in (194a–b).
(194)   (a) Wek tomoyek’.
            “I am this tall, I am this old.”                                      FS 1980 (PP)
        (b) Yo na’mee lok keech tom’.
            “He is now two years old.”                                                 YL 1951Other similar verbs are tomeek’ “it is (a particular depth)”, tomonemek’ “I take (a particular
amount)”, and tompeyok’ “I eat (a particular amount)”. In all cases the implication of the
root tom-, unless otherwise speciﬁed, is that the amount is relatively large.","[135, 136]"
"¹ In his book The Yurok language (1958), R. H. Robins used the term “intensive” to describe what are here called
  iterative verbs. These verbs were studied in detail by Andrew Garrett, “Reduplication and inﬁxation in Yurok”
  (2001), and Esther Wood, The semantic typology of pluractionality (2007), chapter 4 (for full references see
  the Bibliography on page 299).
60        /     Additional verb types
6.6.1 Forming iteratives
To form an iterative verb, in most cases the vowel-consonant sequence -eg- is inserted
before the ﬁrst vowel of the verb. (Equivalently, -eg- is inserted after the ﬁrst consonant
or group of consonants.) Some examples of this pattern are shown in Table 6.9.          basic (non-iterative) verb         iterative verb     a    chyuuek’wenek’   “I sit down”      chyeguuek’wenek’    “I frequently sit down”
          kohchewok’       “I catch it”      kegohchewok’        “I frequently catch it”
          nepek’           “I eat”           negepek’            “I frequently eat”
          saa’agochek’     “I speak Yurok”   segaa’agochek’      “I frequently speak Yurok”
     b    chahchew         “be diﬃcult”      chegahchew          “be frequently diﬃcult”
          ho’omah          “make a ﬁre”      hego’omah           “make a lot of ﬁres”
          ten              “rain”            tegen               “frequently rain”
          teykelew         “bite”            tegeykelew          “bite a lot”       Table 6.9: Basic iterative verb forms (a inﬂected verbs; b non-inﬂected verbs)As the examples show, iteratives can be formed from inﬂected or non-inﬂected verbs.
    In addition to the basic pattern in Table 6.9, there are three variant iterative patterns
for verbs of special forms. First, if a verb begins with a glottal stop (’), then the iterative
verb inserts -e’g- rather than -eg-. Examples are in (66).
(66)      Iteratives formed from verbs beginning with a glottal stop (’)
          (a) ’ahspuemek’ “I drink it” → ’e’gahspuemek’
          (b) ’oloyew “call, hoot, make noise” → ’e’goloyew
          (c) ’omeemoh “speak Hupa” → ’e’gomeemoh
     Second, if a verb’s ﬁrst vowel is an e followed by g or k (including glottalized k’), then
its iterative often changes the vowel to the long vowel eee. Examples are given in (67).
(67)      Iteratives formed from verbs with -eg-, -ek-
          (a) chpegor’ “hold a race” (non-inﬂected) → chpeeegor’
          (b) kweget “visit” (non-inﬂected) → kweeeget
          (c) nekek’ “I put it (somewhere)” → neeekek’
    Finally, if a verb’s ﬁrst vowel is an e followed by kw or w (including glottalized k’w,
’w), then its iterative often changes the vowel to the long vowel uue. Examples are given
in (67).
(68)      Iteratives formed from verbs with -ekw-, -ew-
          (a) hew “live, be healthy” (non-inﬂected) → huuew
          (b) pewomek’ “I cook” → puuewomek’

The examples in (69) show the use of iterative verbs to express repetition. Translations
in context may include “always”, “frequently”, “a lot”, and “off and on”, among some other
possibilities.

plural nouns (like pegerey “old women”); and nouns with -eg- that name things with
characteristic associations. Examples of the latter are hega’p’oh “cottonwood”, named af-
ter ha’p’oh “pitch”; and segep “coyote”, so named because coyotes are frequently in the
sepolah “prairie, open high country”. There are numerous animal and plant names with
this pattern.
Chapter 7Time reference with preverbsBasic time reference is expressed in Yurok by preverbs and preverb combinations. It is
also possible to use adverbs of time, words like chmeyaan “yesterday”, we’yk’oh “now”,
and ’owook “tomorrow”. These do not need to be pre-verbal, and they can stand on their
own without a verb. But they supplement the basic system of preverbs, to make time
reference more speciﬁc. The use of the most common preverbs for this purpose is the
subject of this chapter.","[90, 91, 92, 93, 94]"

 Chapter 4 Articles and pronouns Articles and pronouns belong to different word classes, as discussed in chapter 2, but
 they nonetheless share an important feature of meaning. Both can express meaning dis-
 tinctions that involve proximity and distance, such as “near” vs. “far”, or “this” vs. “that”.¹
 4.1 Pronouns
 4.1.1 Personal pronouns
 Personal pronouns in Yurok are words that refer to speakers and addressees — the equiv-
 alent of English I, me, and you. Table 4.1 lists the personal pronouns that are documented
 in Modern Yurok.²                                     singular       plural      contrastive        objective                    1st person       nek            nekah       nekee’             nekach

 “we, us” and kelew “you” are very common. They are not simply the equivalent of the
 English subject pronouns I and you. In addition to being used as subjects of sentences,
 they are used as objects of prepositions like ho, mehl, and ’o. This is illustrated in (21).","[60, 61, 62]"
"¹ Subjunctive verbs were called pronominal-prefix verbs in R. H. Robins’s The Yurok language (1958; for the
  full reference see the Bibliography on page 299). A subjunctive non-inﬂected verb is in fact indistinguishable
  from a possessed noun; the word ’ue-pa’ah may be interpreted as “for it to be wet” (non-inﬂected verb) or
  “its water” (noun). An alternative linguistic term for subjunctives might be subordinative, because they are
  associated with subordinate clauses.

 6.4.2 Using subjunctives
 There are many contexts where subjunctives are used. Only a few very common ones
 are described here. The most common context generally is when one verb is subordi-
 nated to another verb.¹ Examples of this type were given in (55–56) above: the verbs
 skewok “want” (non-inﬂected) and skewokseemek’ “I want” (inﬂected) have only subjunc-
 tive complement clauses. Examples showing subjunctives with verbs that mean “thank
 you (for . . .)” or “I am glad (that . . .)” appear in (57).² (57)      (a)     Tewomehl kee k’e-megelook’.
                   “I’m glad that you came with me.”                                            GT 2007 (LC)
           (b) Wokhlew ’ne-newochek’.
               “I’m glad to see you.”                                                        MR ∼1970 (MRo)
           (c) Koweeshcho’ k’ee ma k’er-nergery.
               “Thank you for helping.”                                                        FS 1951 (RHR)
¹ Strictly speaking, the type of subordination at issue is complementation. Attributive verbs (§6.5) are used
  in another subordinate clause type, the relative clause.
² Learners will note that in Classical Yurok not all speakers used the words wokhlew and koweeshcho’ in the
  same way they are used today.
56      /      Additional verb types
Other instances of this pattern (subjunctive verbs subordinated to another verb in the
context) are found with verbs like nekomuy “know how (to do something)” and chahch-
esek’ “I am tired (of doing something)” and expressions like keech ’ee roo “it is time (to do
something)” and keech ’ee son’ “people are ready (to do something)”. These are illustrated
in (58).","[85, 86, 87]"
"  5.1 Overview
  Many details of verb formation are in chapters 5–6. First, an overview of some of the
  most important categories of inﬂected verbs may be useful. The speciﬁc categories iden-
  tiﬁed pertain to mood, a linguistic term which refers broadly to the type of sentence or
  clause that a verb appears in. Yurok inﬂected verbs have four different moods, as follows:
• indicative (discussed in this chapter): used in most simple statements and questions
• imperative (discussed in this chapter): used in direct commands
• subjunctive (§6.4): typically used when one verb is dependent on another verb
• attributive (§6.5): used in phrases that modify or stand in for nouns
38      /      Basic verb formation
    The four moods have somewhat different endings, and are used in different ways.
Given in (37) are forms of hegook’ “I walk, I go”: an indicative, an imperative, a subjunc-
tive, and an attributive.(37)    (a) indicative: Nek keetee hegook’ so Rek’woy.
            “I am going to go to Requa.”                                                         YL 1951
        (b) imperative: Hego’och so kue muenchey nahko’!
            “Go to the white board!”                                                  GT 2003 (YLCB)
        (c) subjunctive: Nek weet soneenepek’ kee ’n-egook’.
            “I think I will go.”                                                          FS 1980 (PP)
        (d) attributive: Soo smeykoluemee’ kue keech hegookween.
            “They miss the one who has gone.”                                             FS 1980 (PP)
5.2     Non-inﬂected verbs
Non-inﬂected verbs (abbreviated vn in the dictionary) have no endings. They are shorter
— sometimes a lot shorter — than their inﬂected counterparts; often they are used in
very common expressions. Table 5.1 lists some common non-inﬂected verbs, together
with their inﬂected counterparts.        non-inflected verbs                inflected counterparts        chahchew “it’s diﬃcult”

5.3.1 Singular e-class verbs
Table 5.2 shows how e-class verbs work for singular subjects, that is, where one person
does the verbal action; either I do it (1 sg); you (one person) do it (2 sg); or he, she, or
it does it (3 sg).                                  “run”          “push (it)”   “swim”                          1 sg    ro’opek’       myootek’      kepoyuerek’

hegolek’ (page 146) has several irregular forms, including hem’ “he, she says, tells” and
the imperatives hach’es and heks’es “tell him, her!”","[68, 69, 70, 71]"
"Inﬂected forms
The plural of hegolek’ is rarely used, because 3 sg passive hee’ or hegee’ “it was said’
is often used where English usage might prefer “they said (something)”. There is no

¹ The second syllable of hlker’merkerhlkeenek’ “I tie a knot” is not stressed, though it follows a heavy syllable;
  this appears to contradict the pattern. The reason for this exception is that this Yurok stress pattern never
  affects a single light syllable surrounded by two heavy syllables; such syllables are not stressed.

  Chapter 2  Word classes  In any language, words can be grouped into various classes, which are deﬁned partly by
  their meaning and partly by how they are used in sentences. It is useful to identify the
  word classes of a language because then you can make general statements about them,
  such as “Yurok nouns do not usually change according to whether they are singular or
  plural” and “Yurok preverbs are positioned before the verb”.
      Though there are many similarities across languages, word classes do differ from
  language to language. For example, English has a class of adjectives; Yurok does not.
  In Yurok, the meanings that are expressed by English adjectives are instead expressed
  by the class of verbs. Likewise, English has no class of preverbs despite the importance
  of this word class in Yurok grammar. English also lacks non-inflected verbs.
      Every Yurok word belongs to one of the ten word classes below.","[46, 47, 48]"

  The differences in meaning among the time-reference categories above can be subtle.
  Differences between the following pairs are brieﬂy described here:
• General present vs. resultative keech; see (96)
• Resultative keech vs. durative present ’ochkaa; see (97–100)
• Durative present ’ochkaa vs. inceptive keet; see (101)
• Resultative keech vs. inceptive keet; see (102–103)
• Inceptive keet vs. prospective keetee; see (104)
• Prospective keetee vs. modal future kee; see (105)      The difference between keech and the general present (with no preverb) is illustrated
  in (96).  (96)    (a)   Komchuechek’.
                “I know you.”                                                           JJ 2004 (JB)
          (b) Keech komchuechek’.
              “I know you now.”                                                         JJ 2004 (JB)  The example in (96a) was given as a good, positive answer to the question Komchuepa’
  hes? “Do you know me?” The example in (96b) would be appropriate if the speaker at
  ﬁrst could not remember the other person, and then suddenly recalled: “Oh, now I know
  you!” That is, keech signals a change of situation from not knowing to knowing.
     The difference between keech and ’ochkaa is illustrated in (97–100).  (97)    (a)   Keech swoo’mel’.
                “He stinks (from contact with something).”                                   YL 1951

 recent change of state. In each (b) example, ’ochkaa is appropriate because the action is
 presented as ongoing without a necessary starting or ending point.
     The difference between ’ochkaa and keet is illustrated by the example in (101), with
 two consecutive sentences.
 (101)     ’Ochkaa pekwoluem’ kue ’w-oleehl.
           Keet holeem’ ’we-no’os.
           “She’s peeling her hazel sticks.
           She’s starting to make a baby basket.”                                                JJ 2007 (LC) The ﬁrst sentence above, with ’ochkaa, describes an ongoing action (peeling hazel sticks)
 that may have been underway for a while; the second sentence indicates that this action
 is the ﬁrst step in making a baby basket.
     The difference between keech and keet is illustrated by the examples in (102–103).
 The verb kweskwesek’ in (102) means “I have a cold”. In (102a) the situation has changed
 so that the speaker already has a cold, whereas in (102b) the speaker is starting to have
 a cold, or is about to have a cold.
 (102)     (a) Keech kweskwesek’.
               “I have a cold.”                                                                 JJ 2006 (AG)
           (b) Keet kweskwesek’.
               “I’m catching a cold.”                                                           JJ 2006 (AG) The verb neskwechook’ in (103) means “arrive”. In (103a), the situation has changed so
 that the addressee has now arrived and is here. In (103b), the subject is starting to arrive
 (lit. “come near”) but has not yet arrived; actually having arrived would be expressed
 with keech.
 (103)     (a) Keech neskwechoom’.
               “(Finally) you’ve arrived.”                                                      AF 2002 (JB)
           (b) Keet neskwechok’w.
               “He’s coming.”                                                                 MM 1927 (ES)      The difference between keet and keetee is illustrated in (104).¹
 (104)     (a) Keet kwechkeesh.
               “He’s defecating.”                                                           FD ∼1962 (WB)

 while keet means it has begun.
     Finally, the future uses of kee differ from uses of keetee in two important ways. First,
 kee often has a nuance that suggests the English translation “shall” — it can convey a¹ The speaker in these examples used a more colloquial English translation than the one printed in (104).

with ﬁrst-person and second-person subjects. This is in contrast with keetee, which sim-
ply expresses a prediction about the future, and is typical with impersonal verbs or verbs
with inanimate subjects.
    Second, whereas keetee is often associated with a prediction for the near future or an
impending event, and can thus often be translated “about to”, kee carries no such impli-
cation. For example, in (105), the syntactic context in each case makes the time of the
verb with kee entirely indeﬁnite.(105)    (a)    Nek kwelekw neemee komchuemek’ kwen kol’ kee nepek’.
                “I don’t know when I will eat.”                                              JJ 2007 (LC)

Resultative keech can be combined with past-time and future-time preverbs. In each case
the meaning of the resulting combination is the sum of its elements: it means that the
76      /     Time reference with preverbs
subject of the verb is now in a state or circumstance (keech) in which he or she was doing
(ho), did (ma), or can do (kee) something.
   A common combination is keech ho. In many cases a good translation is just “have
done it”. For example, if someone asks “What are you doing?”, you might answer with a
keech ho sentence. Examples are in (106).
(106)   Examples of keech ho
        (a) Keech ho nep’ puuek.
            “He’s been eating deer.”                                         MM 1927 (ES)
        (b) Kel’ hes keech ho helomeyem’?
            “Have you danced yet?”                                                YL 1951
        (c) Kol’ keech ho hohkuemek’.

        (d) Keech ho sloyhlkek’.
            “I’ve been ﬂattening eels.”                                       FS 1980 (PP)
        (e) Keech ho wey ’w-o’omepek’.
            “He had ﬁnished making his ﬁre.”                               DW 1906 (ALK)    A second combination, keech ma, does not mean “have been doing it” but more sim-
ply “has done it”, somewhat analogous to the English expression. An event happened in
the past (ma), but its effect is still present now (keech). Examples are in (107).
(107)   Examples of keech ma
        (a) Keech ma saawelek’.
            “I’ve gotten cold.”                                            GT 2003 (YLCB)
        (b) Keech ma markue’ kue ’n-oolehl.
            “My plants got eaten.”                                            FS 1980 (PP)
        (c) Yo’ keech ma tohpekwtom’.

thing)”; the “can” part of the meaning comes from kee and the “now” part from keech. An
example is in (108).
(108)   Keech kee ’na-’ahspee’moh.
        “Now we can drink.”                                                       YL 1951
Chapter 8Using other preverbs8.1 Using cho’ in exhortations
The preverb cho’ is mostly used with a second-person verb in commands directed by
the speaker to the addressee. For this reason, an English imperative is usually a good
translation. Singular non-bipersonal examples are in (109).
(109) Examples of cho’ in commands: Singular subjects
      (a) Cho’ skeryterrk’wenem’.
          “Put on your dress.”                                                   JJ 2006 (AG)
      (b) Reeek’ew cho’ raayuerem’.
          “Swim by the shore.”                                                   FS 1980 (PP)
      (c) Cho’ wek mehl hohkuemem’ mestok.

(110) Examples of cho’ in commands: Plural and collective subjects
      (a) Cho’ neee’nowow’ mehl nepuy.
          “Watch for salmon.”                                                    FS 1951 (YL)
      (b) Cho’ nue pewahchkeye’mow’ ’o raak.
          “Go wash your faces in the stream.”                                    RS 1951 (YL)Given in (111) are examples of cho’ with bipersonal verbs.
(111) Examples of cho’ in commands: Bipersonal verbs
      (a) Cho’ nahchesem’.
          “Give it to her.”                                                      AF 2001 (JB)

person contexts, as in (112). In sentences like these, the addressee is not necessarily
responsible for following an instruction.

" 1.1.3.5       Rules affecting preverb–verb combinations
 The consonant at the beginning of a verb is sometimes affected by the vowel of an im-
 mediately preceding preverb. This always depends on speech rate; it is more likely in
 more conversational or ﬂuid speech. There are two relevant rules.
     One rule applies to h at the beginning of a verb. Whenever h is immediately preceded
 by a preverb ending in a vowel, then h changes to another consonant. If the vowel is ee,
 then h changes to y; after any other vowel, it changes to g.¹ In the examples in (10), the¹ In older stories, h often changes to l. This pattern was described by Juliette Blevins and Andrew Garrett, “The
  rise and fall of l-sandhi in California Algic” (2007; for the full reference see the Bibliography on page 299).

  1.1.4 Twentieth century pronunciation changes
  All languages change all the time. During the last hundred years, Yurok has changed in
  several ways. If you listen to old recordings or read old transcriptions (or publications),
  you may encounter pronunciations that are less common today. The following are some
  of the most notable Modern Yurok pronunciation changes:
• The variant of the g phoneme that sounds like English g has become more common
  (§1.1.3.1).
• The variant of the w phoneme that sounds like English w has become more common
  (§1.1.3.2).
• The tense variant of the e phoneme more often has the quality of the vowel of English
  bait (§1.1.3.3).
• Some unstressed vowels are likelier to have the neutral quality of the ﬁrst vowel in
  English about.
  These changes reﬂect a process called accommodation, in this case between Yurok
  and English; this is a process that happens when people who are bilingual unconsciously
  adapt their speech to the speech of other people they talk with. Accommodation is a sign
  of linguistic adaptability and strength, a process that happens in all healthy languages all
  the time; speakers of Modern Yurok are as ﬂuent as any earlier generations of speakers.

1.2     Major differences between English and Yurok
When you learn a second language as an adult, your ﬁrst language always inﬂuences
your new language. For example, usually you have an accent in your second language;
you do not sound like somebody who grew up speaking that language. To reduce your
accent and what you carry over from your ﬁrst language, it can be helpful to focus on
major differences between the two languages.
    Six major differences between English and Yurok are described here; if you pay atten-
tion to these differences, your Yurok may sound less English-inﬂuenced. You can hear
recordings of most words below on the Yurok Language Project website (linguistics.
berkeley.edu/~yurok).","[41, 42, 43]"

The verb rohseemek’ is a transitive verb whose object is the target, as in (280).

target. With both verbs, the object thrown is expressed in a prepositional phrase with
mehl; an example is in (281).
(281) Rohsek’ mehl ’ne-koweesh.
      “I threw my stick.” (lit. “I threw with my stick.”)                                     FS 1980 (PP)

"  1.1.3.2 The phoneme w
  The phoneme w has two pronunciation variants:
• The most common Modern Yurok variant is identical to English w.
• A common Classical Yurok variant is a slightly stronger articulation with air passing
  between the tongue and the roof of the mouth and with the lips rounded. This is a com-
  bination of w and the weak variant of g.
  If you listen carefully to recordings of words like newook’ “I see it”, you will hear both
  pronunciations.³ ¹ Technically, this is a velar fricative [G].
 ² Technically, this is a velar glide [î].
 ³ Technically, the second variant is a labialized velar fricative [Gw ]). It was often written gw by anthropologists
   and other non-Yurok people in the early twentieth century. Yurok does not have a “gw” combination.

                        Figure 1.1: Yurok language camp at ’Ohpoh, 20141.1.3.3    The phoneme e
The phoneme e has three pronunciation variants. First, if e is stressed in the last syllable
of a word (or the only syllable of a one-syllable word), the open pronunciation is used.
Open e is intermediate between the vowels in English head and had. Open e is found in
the ﬁnal syllable of the words in (1).
(1)       Open e
          (a) One-syllable words: chekws “heart”, mech “ﬁre”, ’yekwhl “maggot”
          (b) Two-syllable words with open e before w or y: Chuerey “Trinidad”, Hop’ew
              “Klamath”, perey “old woman”
          (c) Other two-syllable words: chewes “hand”, keekwten “moss”, keeshen “sum-
              mer”, pontet “ashes”
Open e is sometimes spelled “a” by users of the Yurok Alphabet, but it is not the same
as the vowel in English had; nor does it have the same quality as the a vowels in Yurok
ma (past time preverb), ch’eeshah “dog”, or chaahl “beach”.
    Second, if e is stressed in the ﬁrst syllable of a word with more than one syllable,
the tense pronunciation is used (but not before r). Tense e is intermediate between lax
e and the vowel sound of English hate and bait; for some but not all Yurok speakers it
may be identical to that English sound. In each word in (2), the ﬁrst vowel is a tense e
and the second e is either open (if it is in the ﬁnal syllable) or lax.

        (a) Repetitive verbs: slekwslekw “put clothes on”, tekwtekwsook’ “I cut it up”,
             tektekon’ “it’s sticky”
        (b) Nouns and non-inﬂected verbs: chekwchem “black acorns”, keget “mountain
             lion”, keychek “tired”, kweget “visit”, legech “mudhen”, segep “coyote”
Tense e is spelled “ey” in the Yurok Alphabet, but is not the same sound as the combi-
nation of e plus y. That combination occurs in words like cheykenee “small”, and is also
spelled “ey” in the Yurok Alphabet.
    Third, in all other contexts (wherever open and tense e are not used), the lax pro-
nunciation is used. Lax e is the same as the vowel sound of English head.
    Open and tense e only occur in stressed syllables and only in adverbs, interjections,
nouns, pronouns, and verbs — not in the various particle word classes (see §2.6). Oth-
erwise, there are very few exceptions to the rules above; one common exception is hesek’,
whose ﬁrst syllable has a lax vowel rather than the tense vowel.
    The relationships among the variant pronunciations of e can clearly be seen when
the same vowel, in a related word, undergoes a change because its word position has
changed. Several such examples are in (3–6). In each case, the ﬁrst word has a tense e
that becomes open e in the related second word. For example, in each verb pair in (3),
the ﬁrst form is a 1 sg verb with tense e in the initial syllable and the second form is the
corresponding 3 sg verb with an open e.
(3)     Tense e → Open e: Verb pairs
        (a) chkeyek’ “I sleep” → chkey’ “s/he sleeps”
        (b) nekek’ “I put it” → nek’ “s/he puts it”
        (c) nepek’ “I eat” → nep’ “s/he eats”
In each noun pair in (4), the ﬁrst form is a full noun with tense e in the initial syllable
and the second form is the corresponding short form with an open e (on short forms see
§3.4 beginning on page 27).
(4)     Tense e → Open e: Noun pairs
        (a) lewet “net” → ’ne-lew “my net”
        (b) ’leptoyhl “hair” → ’ne-’lep “my hair”
        (c) pekcheech “rope” → ’ue-pek “his or her rope”
        (d) ’ne-k’ep’ch’em → ’ne-k’ep’ “my daughter-in-law”
In each word pair in (5), the ﬁrst word is a longer noun or verb with tense e in the
initial syllable and the second form is an iterative with an open e (on iteratives see §6.6
beginning on page 59).
(5)     Tense e → Open e: Iteratives
        (a) meskwoh “medicine” → meges “doctor”
        (b) sepolah “prairie” → segep “coyote” (“goes on the prairies”)
        (c) tetolo’hl → teget “cry”
Finally, in the miscellaneous related word pairs in (6), the ﬁrst example in each case has
tense e in an initial syllable and the second example has open e in a ﬁnal syllable.

 (6)       Tense e → Open e: Miscellaneous word pairs
           (a) pechue → heepech “upriver”
           (b) lekwsee → lekws “outside”
 Compare also the suﬃx -etew- “hand, ﬁnger”, whose second vowel is open e in pletew
 “thumb” and sketew “little ﬁnger”, but lax e in the longer words in (7).

 1.1.3.4       Preﬁx and suﬃx er and err
 Preﬁxes and suﬃxes added to words with the vowels er and err tend to be inﬂuenced
 by those vowels. The affected preﬁxes include possessive ’ne- “my’, our’, k’e- “your”, and
 ’we- “his, her, its, their” (discussed in §3.2); the affected suﬃxes include endings like 1st
 person -ek’, 2nd person -om’, etc.
     When a preﬁx or suﬃx containing a, o, or e is added to a word that has er or err in it,
 then a, o, or e tend to change to er; the long vowels aa and oo likewise tend to change to
 long err. (Usually this does not have any effect on ee or ue.) Examples are given in (8)
 for the preﬁxes ’ne- and ’ke-, and in (9) for the suﬃxes -ek’ and -oom’.
 (8)       The change to er in preﬁxes
           (a) Keech pegerk kue ’ner-merm.
                “My son is already a man.”                                                              YL 1951
           (b) Cho’ chyuep’ery k’er-wer’yers we-’lep!
                “Comb your girl’s hair!”                                                        FS 1951 (RHR) (9)       The change to er in suﬃxes
           (a) Cheeekor’ serrhlerperk’.
                “I am doing everything.”                                                       GT 2003 (YLCB)
           (b) Kel’ kee nergerykerrm’.
                “You will help.”                                                                   FS 1951 (YL) These changes are more likely in conversational speech or story-telling at a ﬂuid pace,
 and less likely in slower speech or when a speaker is pronouncing words carefully.","[38, 39, 40, 41]"

 (112)     Examples of cho’ with ﬁrst-person and third-person subjects
           (a) Chue cho’ nue ko wegesah.
               “Let’s go have a bath.”                                          FS 1951 (YL)
           (b) Cho’ poy ko ’o key kue k’e-rahcheen, kel’ cho’ heenoy ’oolo’oh.
               “Your friend should sit in the front of the boat, you should stand behind.”
                                                                                             FS 1951 (YL) Even more strikingly, in examples like (113), the subject of the verb is not in control of
 the action at all.
 (113)     Examples of cho’ with non-agentive subjects
           (a) ’Eenee kee cho kwelekw tenoo kee mehl ’e’gah.
               “There is bound to be a lot more to eat.”                                     FS 1951 (YL)
           (b) Wek kee cho rohsee’ kue nepuy.
               “The salmon should be speared like this.”                                     FS 1951 (YL)
           (c) Cho’ nuuekwomee’.
               “It should be brought.”                                                       FS 1980 (PP) The best general translations of cho’ are therefore “should”, “ought to”, “are/is to”, and the
 like. These convey exhortation or urging but do not require a command directed at the
 addressee.¹
¹ Linguists might refer to the construction in (109–113) as hortative or even optative, and might call cho’
  a modal preverb. This would explain why cho’ is used in the longer words heep’encho’ and muehlcho’, which
  mean “maybe”, as well as mocho’ “if”; they share meanings of possibility or future-oriented uncertainty.
                                                         Using other preverbs        /       79
    In addition to its very common use in (109–113), cho’ is found in more specialized
constructions. For example, as in (114), it is used in questions together with kues and
soo, son’, etc. to ask how something is.","[109, 110]"

Verbs with similar meanings
Other verbs whose uses are similar to hlook’ include ’ekonemek’ “I hold it” (page 204) and
negemek’ “I bring it” (page 216). The difference is that hlook’ always refers to taking hold
of something (or someone) — grabbing it, fetching it, etc. By contrast, ’ekonemek’ simply
means “hold’ (not “take hold of’), and negemek’ implies bringing or carrying something
from one place to another.

Grammatical description: transitive e-class verb
Related verb
      • loo “be thrown” (non-inﬂected)
Meaning and usage
The verb lootek’ refers to throwing, or more generally any tossing or dropping of an
object whose path is not completely controlled. Good translations may include “throw”
or “drop”, especially for the expression skelee lootek’ “I throw it down” in (302b); wohpue
lootek’ means “I drown him” as in (302c).

17.5           Tmegook’ “I hunt”
Grammatical description: optionally transitive oo-class verb (3 sg -o’)
Related verb
      • tmook’ “I shoot it”
Meaning and usage
Strictly speaking, tmegook’ is the iterative of tmook’ (because hunting involves repeated
shooting). But tmegook’ is much more common than tmook’; the usual way to say “I shot
it” is tmoolook’. Examples of tmegook’ are in (282).
(282)     (a) ’Owook kue tmegook’.
              “I will go hunting tomorrow.”                                     GM 2004 (AG)
          (b) We’yk’oh kwelekw ’ochkaa tmego’.

          (c) Ma tmegook’.
              “I went hunting.”                                                         YL 1951The iterative tmeeegook’ is illustrated in (283). This can mean “I always hunt” (“I am a
hunter”) or, as in (283b), that several people are hunting.
(283)     (a) Chpee nee ’we-tmeeegook’ kue cheenes.
              “All the young man did was hunt.”                                DW 1906 (ALK)

is probably because of the generic meaning of the object puuek in context; the men are
hunting for deer in general, not any speciﬁc deer.)Inﬂected forms
There are some irregular forms with a long vowel in the second syllable. Note that the

22.3       Hesek’ “I think”
Grammatical description: optionally transitive e-class verbMeaning and usage
The verb hesek’ means “I intend, I have in mind, I think”, implying or expressing a speciﬁc
intention or thought. If the intention or thought is expressed, as in (343), it is usually a
direct quotation:
(343)   (a) Kues soo hesem’, Nekee’ ’ne-tektoh?
            “Why did you think, ‘It is my log’?”                                FS 1951 (YL)
        (b) Nekah hesoh Kohpey kee nue goo.
            “We decided to go to Crescent City.”
            (lit. “We think, ‘(We) will go to Crescent City.’ ”)                     YL 1951
        (c) Yo’ kwelekw ma he’s kue kepoyuerek’.
            “He decided to go swimming.”
            (lit. “He thought, ‘I will go swimming.’ ”)                              YL 1951An additional striking construction involves the subjunctive of hesek’, with another verb
of perception or thinking, to introduce the thought, as in (344). This construction is
common in stories but not well documented in casual speech.
(344)   (a) Neemee komchuemek’, ’n-esek’, Kwelekw muehlcho’ kue ’ue-wen muehlcho’
            kue pegerk k’ee roowo’s mehl ho gohkue’.
            “I do not know if it (medicine) was made with the female or the male pipe.”
            (lit. “I do not know, thinking, ‘Maybe the female, maybe the male pipe it
            was made with.’ ”)                                              FS 1951 (YL)
        (b) Tue’ neemee wo hewon newom’, ’w-esek’, Kwelekw kolo hlkehl wee’.
            “He was not the ﬁrst to see that it looked like land.”
            (lit. “He did not ﬁrst see, thinking, ‘It looks like land.’ ”)  FS 1951 (YL)Finally, passives usually occur as 3 sg forms meaning “it is thought”, followed by an
expression of the thought, as in (345a–b). Sometimes, as in (345c), the passive is con-
strued to mean that the subject is thought to be doing whatever the following verb ex-
presses.
(345)   (a) Noohl ’o gesee’, Kwelekw, mos kee ’ee ye’mehl.

Verbs with similar meanings
The two most common verbs meaning “think” are hesek’ and soosek’ (page 258). The
verb hesek’ expresses the nuance “have in mind, intend”, referring to a thought, while
soosek’ refers to a manner of thought, and can express thinking about something or
244     /          Verbs of perception and thinking
someone (probably it originated as a combination of soo “thus, in a certain way” and
hesek’). Also relatively common are chpoksek’ “I think hard, meditate, study” and the
related verbs chperwerksek’, chperwerkseemek’, and chpwerwerk (page 241), all of which
refer to having something (a person or thought) in mind, especially as a memory.","[271, 272, 273, 274, 275]"
"7.1 Background
There are several important differences between the Yurok and English systems of time
reference. One concerns basic tense categories. In English, the basic categories are
past vs. present vs. future: “I saw” vs. “I see” vs. “I will see”. Many languages have an
English-style three-way set, but many other languages — including Yurok — have differ-
ent systems. It is possible to distinguish past-time and future-time preverbs in Yurok,
but the basic system is more nuanced.
    A second important difference has to do with present vs. past time. In English,
whenever you use a verb you must choose between a present-time form (I see) or a
past-time form (I saw), among other verb forms. A distinction between present and
past is obligatory in English grammar. But in Yurok, depending on context, verbs may
express either present or past time; for example, newook’ can mean either “I see” or “I
(recently) saw”. The context will usually make the intended meaning clear.
    A third important difference concerns aspect. Linguists use this term to describe
such concepts as starting and completing an action, as well as the viewpoint that a
speaker chooses on an action being described (for example, depicting it as ongoing or
unitary). You do not need to know this terminology, but the concepts sometimes play a
key role in Yurok preverb choice.
    Table 7.1 on page 65 lists the eight Yurok categories of time reference described
in this chapter, with the frequency of each preverb. By far the most frequent is keech;
second is kee. Many preverbs of time are omitted from Table 7.1 and are not discussed
here. They would be included in a complete study of Yurok grammar, though some are
poorly documented, making it hard to understand all their nuances.

Figure 7.1: A. L. Kroeber in the early 1900s. Beginning in 1901, Kroeber worked with many Yurok elders
and cultural leaders on linguistic and cultural documentation. He and his colleagues recorded over a dozen
hours of Yurok narratives and songs using early recording technology, beginning in 1902; he also transcribed
dozens of other narratives and much information about vocabulary and grammar. In the 1930s and 1940s he
worked extensively with Robert Spott; they coauthored Yurok narratives in 1942.

of examples of each preverb in a corpus of over 6,000 sentences (as of July 2014)
     It is not essential to learn the terms in Table 7.1; the key point is how the preverbs
are used. This is described in §§7.2–7.4; combinations of keech with other preverbs are
described in §7.5.2. The categories of time reference in Table 7.1 also play a role in Yurok
negation and directed motion, topics which will be discussed in §§8.2–8.3.
     The ﬁrst column in Table 7.1 identiﬁes the reference time: past, present, or future.
For example, ’ochkaa is said to have present reference; it is present-referring. This term
indicates the kind of adverb that can be used together with each category. Past-referring
categories can be used with adverbs like chmeyaan “yesterday” or heekon “formerly”;
present-referring categories can be used with adverbs like we’yk’oh “now, today”; and
the future-referring preverb kee can be used with adverbs like ’owook “tomorrow”. This
is illustrated explicitly in (71–74).
     The examples in (71) show that ho and ma have past reference. The adverbs heekon
“long ago” and kohchee “once (one time)” explicitly anchor the reference to a past time.
(71)     Past-time adverbials with ho and ma

“right now, today” anchors the time reference.

         (a) We’yk’oh keech ’ne-neskwechok’.

 perception (ko’moyom’ “he heard”, newook’ “I saw”). The situation described by keet must
 therefore be present at the time of perception.
     Finally, the examples in (74) shows that kee has future reference.

 Three past-referring categories are described in this section: the general past; and the
 situational and punctual past, which are expressed through preverbs. These terms
 are explained in (75).¹
 (75)      (a) The term general past applies to verbs with no time-reference preverbs,
               which can refer generally to the present or the past. For example, ko’moyok’
               can mean “I heard it”; you might ask ko’moyom’ hes? “did you hear it?”
           (b) The situational past preverb ho indicates that a past action or situation
               existed, but implies nothing about its ending. At the relevant past time,
               the action or situation might not have been over (it might have been con-
               tinuing). Ho is used in the intended meaning “was doing (something)”.
           (c) The punctual past preverb ma indicates that a past action took place in
               one moment, or is understood as completed at a moment in the past. If the
               intended meaning is “went and did (something)”, ma is used.
     The general past category in (75a) is very frequent; sentences that refer to past time
 often lack preverbs of time, especially in narratives describing successive events. This is
 shown in (76) with consecutive sentences from a story told by Florence Shaughnessy.
 (76)      (a) Hehlkue nee raayor’.
               “He ran along the bank.”
           (b) Kwesee kolchee kol’ ’okw’ hehlkue, neskwee ’emehl raayor’ kue ’yoch.
               “And once he was somewhere on the river bank, (and) the boat was passing
               near him.”                                                      FS 1951 (YL) Each verb in (76) refers to an event in a past-time narrative sequence; none occurs with
 a preverb of time.
     One way to contrast the past-time preverbs ho and ma in (75b–c) is in their use
 in answering questions. This is shown in Table 7.2 on page 67. If you ask what was¹ Linguists might use the terms imperfective and perfective rather than situational and punctual, but
  the terms used here may be clearer. Note that Yurok does have other past-time preverbs, such as ’ap, but these
  are less frequent than the two discussed here.

 Chapter 1 The sounds of Yurok 1.1 Writing and pronunciation
 The principle of the basic sound, which linguists call the phoneme, underlies the writing
 of a language and its sound patterns. In every language, sounds can be arranged into a
 set of phonemes or basic sounds. Sometimes a phoneme is pronounced in only one
 way in a language; or a single phoneme may have two or more different pronunciations
 depending on its position in the word, or on nearby sounds.¹ In what follows, the writing
 system to be described is phonemic in the sense that each basic Yurok sound has a
 unique spelling (which may consist of more than one letter, such as ch, er, or eee).","[30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"

another form used.)

20.3       Hlook’ “I grab it”
Grammatical description: transitive oo-class verb (3 sg -om’)
Meaning and usage
The verb hlook’ has various translations in context, including “get”, “grab”, “take”, and even
“arrest”, but it usually means to take hold of something (or someone). Examples are in
(297).(297)   (a)   Kel’ hes hloom’ kue ’ne-pegem?
              Did you take my knife?”                                             GT 2007 (LC)
        (b) ’O hlom’ ’we-chye’wol.
            “He took out his ﬂute.”                                             DW 1906 (LCC)
        (c) Hl’os k’e-kergerwers mehl kue koleen k’e-chewes.
            “Hold your wrist with your other hand.”                                FS 1951 (YL)This verb is common with nue and equivalent preverbs (“go get”), as in (298).(298)   (a)   Nue hl’os!
              “Go get it!”                                                      GT 2003 (YLCB)
        (b) Keech nue hlee’ kegey.
            “Somebody’s gone to get the doctor.”                                   AF 2001 (JB)
        (c) Nek kue hlook’ kue ’yohlkoych’.
            “I will go get wood.”                                                 JVP 2001 (JB)The examples in (299–300) show that while hlook’ usually refers to taking something
physically (grabbing it with the hands), it can also be used metaphorically. In (299) the
verb means “obtain possession, acquire ownership”, with the source expressed by mehl.","[235, 236, 237, 238]"
"10.2.4        Verbs in weno’om- “how far”
Verbs that begin with the relative root weno’om- answer (or ask) the question “how far?”
They typically refer to a location (in space or time), and are used only in sentences where
an additional word or phrase indicates the location. In (195a), for example, the location
is indicated by wee’ “that (place)”, and in (195b) it is expressed by poyew noohl “far ahead”.
(195)   (a) Kel’ kem wee’ ho weno’omuerem’.
            “You too swam there.”                                                      YL 1951
        (b) Poyew noohl weno’omor’ kue mewah.
            “The boy is running far ahead.”                                            YL 1951The relative roots no’om- and weno’om- are similar; the difference is that weno’om- verbs
express how far along something has moved, while no’om- expresses how long some-
thing is (not necessarily in motion). For example, while no’omek’ means “it (a worm-
or roped-shaped object) is long”, weno’omoksee’hl “it is a (speciﬁed) season” refers to the
metaphorical motion of time.",[136]
" 6.1.1 Forming passives
 The most regular type of passive is formed as follows. For an e-class verb (1 sg -ek’),
 the passive is formed in a variety of semi-regular and sometimes irregular ways; often a
 suﬃx -el- or -ey- is used. For an o-class or oo-class verb (1 sg -ok’ or -ook’), the passive
 is formed in -oye- (1 sg -oyek’). All passive verbs are themselves e-class verbs, whether
 they are passives of e-class, o-class, or oo-class verbs. Some of the patterns are illustrated
 in Table 6.1 on page 50. The 1 sg forms in this table have the meanings in (48).
 (48)      (a)    myewoletelek’ “I am pushed under the water, somebody pushed me under
                  the water”
¹ To describe these verb forms R. H. Robins used the term passive in his book The Yurok language (1958).
  In an article “Pragmatic convergence: Person hierarchies in northern California” (2002), Lisa Conathan has
  shown that they are what linguists would now call inverse verb forms; this explains some key differences
  from English passives. (For full references see the Bibliography on page 299.) Linguists may wish to note the
  following additional analytic point: while Robins treated these as inﬂectional forms of the verbs with which
  they are associated here, this may not be the correct analysis. It may instead be the case that “passive” forms
  are among a suite of derivationally related verbs with different argument-structure properties.
