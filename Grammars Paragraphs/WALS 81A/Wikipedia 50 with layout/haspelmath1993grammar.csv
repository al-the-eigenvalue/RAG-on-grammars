16.1. Grammatical relations: the notion of subject
16.1.1. Subject propertiesNotions such as subject, direct object, indirect object, etc. (i.e. grammatical
relations, or syntactic functions) are generally used sparingly in this book.
The reason is that their use is not as straightforward in role-dominated lan-
guages like Lezgian as it is in reference-dominated languages like English.
There are very few generalizations that need to be stated over grammatical
relations.
   The subject is the most important grammatical relation, and I will mostly
be concerned with this notion in this section. There is some evidence, albeit
rather slight, that a notion of subject is needed in Lezgian grammar. The ar-
guments that have subject status are the Absolutive argument of intransi-
tive verbs, the Ergative argument of transitive verbs, and the Dative argu-
ment in the Affective Construction.
   However, most of the properties that often serve to identify subjects in
other languages do not uniquely identify subjects in Lezgian. Following
Keenan (1976), we can divide subject properties into coding properties and
behavioral properties. Coding properties are case marking, subject-verb
agreement, word order and the like. Case marking would of course identify
the Absolutive argument both of intransitive and of transitive sentences as
the subject. However, case marking is not normally considered sufficient
evidence for grammatical relations in languages with ergative case marking.
Subject-verb agreement is lacking in Lezgian. There is some weak evidence
from word order that Ergative agents and Dative experiencers are both sub-
jects, because both precede the Absolutive argument in the unmarked order:(799) Alfija.di     maqala       kxe-na.

      Mu'minat-DAT        Ibrahim       see-AOR      'Mu'minat saw Ibrahim.'
                                                            16.1. Grammatical relations   295However, since word order is very flexible (especially the order of argu-
ments and clausal adjuncts, cf. 16.2.), this is very weak evidence. It is just as
possible that the true word order generalization is a strong tendency for
topics to precede non-topics, and for agents and experiencers to be topics.
   Behavioral properties have to do with behavior in valence-changing (or
relation-changing) operations and with behavior in various types of coref-
erential constructions. Valence-changing operations do not yield any criteria
in Lezgian, because the only valence-changing verbal categories, the
Causative and the Anticausative (cf. 10.1.-2.), affect only one type of argu-
ment (Causatives are formed only from intransitive verbs, Anticausatives
only from transitive verbs). It is only in coreferential constructions that we
begin to get some clearer evidence for a notion of subject in Lezgian, as dis-
cussed in the following two sections.","[314, 315]"
"16.2. Word order at the clause levelLike noun-phrase-internal and adjective-phrase-internal word order,
clause-level word order is generally head-final, i.e. verb-final. However,
whereas head-final word order is obligatory in noun phrases and adjective
phrases, verb-final order is only the preferred word order in independent
sentences. Alternative orders are possible, especially in the colloquial lan-
guage. The order of the other major constituents of the clause (arguments
and adjuncts) is quite free, although there is a strong tendency for the sub-
ject to precede the other arguments.

jority of cases, at least in the written standard language. This is illustrated by
(810) and by many other examples in this grammar.","[318, 319]"
"14.4. Word order in the noun phraseNoun phrases are strictly head-final. All types of modifiers precede their
head: quantifiers (see 14.2.), appositions (see 14.3.), demonstratives (cf. 683),
adjective phrases (cf. 684), Genitive NPs (cf. 685), and relative clauses (see
19.1.).(683) a       insan-ar     (J89:21)
      t h a t human-PL

      Daghestan-GEN            city-PL-INESS
      'in the cities of Daghestan'   The order of noun modifiers with respect to each other is relatively free,
and the generalizations below reflect only the orders that are used most
commonly. Native speakers tend to accept most possible orders. In many
cases there may be semantic differences between different orders (e.g. reflect-
ing different scope relations), but they are too subtle to be described here.","[279, 280]"
"While word order in Lezgian is generally rather free, there is a very strong
tendency for the elements of a constituent to be adjacent. Discontinuous
noun phrases, as can be found in languages like Latin or Warlpiri, are pro-
hibited in Lezgian.
    However, sometimes subordinate clauses appear to exhibit discontinu-
ities. An example is (823) (cf. also (457a), (568a), (1156), (1163b)).",[323]
"
1.2.3. SyntaxWord order patterns in Lezgian are overwhelmingly head-final. This order
is obligatory in noun phrases (Genitive-noun, adjective-noun, numeral-
noun, demonstrative-noun, etc.), adjective phrases, and postpositional
phrases, and it is preferred for clauses. However, alongside SOV order other
orders are also possible, especially in the spoken language.
   The case-marking patterns in clauses is uniformly ergative, as shown in
(2) (for notational conventions used in example sentences, see 1.3.4.-5.).(2) a. Stxa         k'wal.i-z        xta-na.

          sister(ERG) brother(ABS) house-DAT send-AOR          T h e sister sent the brother home.'","[25, 26]"
"   Besides information structure, another important factor is clearly heavi-
ness, which leads to the predominantly clause-initial position of adverbial
clauses (cf. Ch. 21).

       'Mother accidentally caused the curtain to catch fire.'
Thus, the Adelative NP in (793) is not at all parallel syntactically to the
Ergative NP in (794). The verb xun Areale' is transitive in (794), but intransi-
tive in (793). While the Ergative NP behaves like an English subject in most
respects, the Adelative NP can be likened to English ora-phrases ('The cur-
tain caught fire on mother;' 'The flowers wilted on Maisa.') or to the
German dativus incommodi ('Die Blumen sind ihr verwelkt.').

                              Syntax of the clauseThe preceding chapter on verbal valence contains the central information
on clause-internal syntax. This chapter deals with some further issues: the
problem of grammatical relations (especially the subject, 16.1.), word order at
the clause level (16.2.), and clausal adjuncts (16.3.).","[313, 314]"

21.6.1. The postposition patal 'in order to'Patal 'in order to/for' is identical to the postposition patal 'for' (cf. 12.2.2.4.).
It takes a Masdar clause in the Absolutive case. ΡαίαΖ-clauses may have a
subject of their own, as in (1091), but their subject is most often controlled by
a salient argument in the superordinate clause, as in (1090).

   Complement clauses can roughly be divided into subject-controlled and
object-controlled clauses. Some complement-taking verbs that take subject-
controlled complements are k'an- 'want', d- 'know how to', werdiS Aun 'get
used to' (with infinitival complements, 20.2.1.-3.); dawamarun        'continue',
aqwazarun     'stop', q'et'un 'decide' (with Masdar complements, 20.3.3-4.).
Some complement-taking verbs that take object-controlled complements
are tun 'make, cause', öirun 'teach' (with Infinitival complements, 20.2.4.);
t'alabun 'ask', bujrugun 'order', qadaga awun 'forbid' (with Masdar com-
plements, 20.3.2.).
   Besides controllers that are subjects in the sense of 16.1., there are also
other salient arguments that are typically animate and that can act as con-
trollers of omitted complement clause subjects, e.g. the Adelative argument
of fun 'be able', the Superelative argument of alaq'un 'be able to' (cf. 20.2.2.),
the Genitive argument of rik'elaj alatun (cf. 20.2.3.).
   Finally, there are complement clause constructions which never show
coreferential omission because the complement clause is the only argument
of the complement-taking verb, e.g. baUamiSun           'begin' (20.2.5.), lazim
'necessary' (20.3.1.).",[428]

300   16. Syntax of the clause  Another condition under which non-verb-final word order is usual is in
the formulaic beginning of a fairy tale:(814) £a-na     q'wan, £a-na-ö                q'wan Abas luhu-da-j                    sa    gada.

      was not, a boy called Abas.') (X89:125)  Outside of these literary conventions, non-verb-final order is not un-
common in direct speech in narrative prose, especially in questions (cf. 815)
and in emphatic or emotional speech (cf. 816).(815) a. Amma        pul      gwa-ni        wa-w? (K86,2:5)

ments, as shown in (817) and in many other sentences in this grammar.(817) a. Gada.di       wiöi-n      £ibin.da-j           c'akul     aqud-na.        (AM87:7)

        I:ABS      quick-ADV village-DAT                retum-FUT         Ί will quickly return to the village.'
However, the order of the arguments with respect to each other seems to be
determined by information structure rather than by grammatical relations.
Given information tends to precede new information, and the subject sim-
ply is most often given information. In those relatively infrequent cases
where another argument is given and the subject is new, the subject follows
that argument:(818) a. Mizafer       sifte        6'exi xci-n          k'wal.i-z       fe-na-j.             Wad

served. In fact, it is quite rarely observed in the modern standard language.
Perhaps the rule reflects an earlier state of the language (and GadZiev's own
intuitions) and has disappeared under the influence of Russian. Thus, ex-
amples as in (926), where GadZiev's rule is violated, are quite normal nowa-
days. In (926a), an intransitive and a transitive verb are conjoined, (926b)
shows the opposite order, and (926c) shows an experiencer verb and a transi-
tive verb.(926) a. Gada       dide.di-n            pataw        qhfe-na        wa        ada-z

ters used as variables for arguments are arbitrary and serve only to distin-
guish different arguments. However, I will often use letters that can be
thought of as mnemonic for particular semantic roles (A: ""agent"", T:
""theme"", L: ""location"", E: ""experiencer"", R: ""recipient""). Otherwise no at-
tempt is made to systematically describe the semantic roles expressed by the
arguments; this information is left implicit in the translations of the indi-
vidual verbs.
   Let us take a concrete example: The verb ilisun has the valence pattern:      V (AERG/ TABS/ LSRESS)and means Ά presses L by putting Τ in contact with L (= A presses L with
T)'. This means that it has an (""agent"") argument in the Ergative case which
corresponds to the subject of 'press' in the translation, a (""theme"") argument
in the Absolutive case which corresponds to the object of 'put in contact
with', and a (""location"") argument in the Superessive case corresponding to
the object of 'press'. This is all the information contained in a valence
frame, and it is sufficient, for example, to obtain the correct translation of
the following sentence:(717) Ada      knopka.da-l     t'ub   ilis-na. (R66:9)
     he(ERG)   button-SRESS    finger press-AOR     'He pressed the button by putting his finger in contact with it.'
     (= 'He pressed the button with his finger.'
     Lit. 'He pressed his finger on the button.')15.2. General characteristics of verbal valence patternsThere are very tight restrictions on possible verbal valence patterns, espe-
cially the following:
   (i) There are no verbs that take fewer than one argument. Weather situa-
tions (rain, snow, etc.), which are expressed by zero-argument verbs in many
                             15.2. General characteristics of verbal valence patterns     269
languages, are expressed as 'rain is falling' (marf qwazwa),  etc. (However,
predicative adjectives may be subjectless, cf. 17.3.)
   (ii) There are no verbs that take more than three arguments.
   (iii) Most of the valence patterns contain an Absolutive argument. There
are a few exceptions which belong to the ""non-standard valence patterns""
and are discussed in 15.4. below.
   (iv) For each intransitive valence pattern with an Absolutive argument
there is a corresponding transitive valence pattern which contains the same
arguments plus an Ergative argument.
   (v) Except for the purely adnominal Genitive case and the rare Directive
cases, all cases occur in at least one valence pattern together with an
Absolutive argument (but see 15.3.15. for ""Genitive arguments"").
   Thus, the valence patterns in (718) are the most typical, and they are
therefore called ""standard valence patterns"" here. Each of them is exempli-
fied in one subsection of 15.3.","[287, 288, 289]"
"
14.4.1. The position of the Genitive NPThe Genitive NP generally precedes all other modifiers because otherwise
those modifiers could be taken as modifying the Genitive noun rather than
its head. In example (686), the Genitive NP precedes an adjective (a), a
demonstrative (b), a quantifier (c), a numeral (d), and even a relative clause
(e) (but see 14.4.2. for the order of relative clauses).(686) a. gatfar.i-n         öimi jug (A90:5)

            'Giildeste's grandson, who bears her husband' name'However, two types of Genitive NPs prefer a position closer to the head
noun: short pronominal Genitives (cf. 687) and non-referential Genitive
modifiers that correspond to English first compound members and to
Russian relational adjectives (cf. 688).
                                                        14.4. Word order in the noun phrase   261(687) a. rahmetlu          zi       wax (583:22)

         this    big       summer-GEN        melon-PL         'these big muskmelons (lit. summer melons)' (not: melons of this
         big summer)All these examples are syntactically ambiguous, but since the other reading
is extremely unlikely in (687) (personal pronouns are hardly ever modified),
and non-referential Genitives form fixed expressions with their head nouns
in (688), the danger of confusion is small.
   When a plausible meaning results, two Genitive NPs may modify the
same head noun:(689) a. öi            a        6'aw.a-n predsedatel'             (R66:12)
         we:GEN t h a t         time-GEN      chairperson         'our chair of that time'      b. zi       gat.u-n            kanikul-ar          (M83:64)
         I:GEN    summer-GEN         vacation-PL         'my summer vacations'
14.4.2. The position of the relative clauseThe participial relative clause is generally the first constituent of its NP be-
cause of its heaviness. If other modifiers preceded the relative clause, these
would be relatively far away from their head nouns. E.g.(690) wa-l             tapSurmiS-da-j           sa c'iji kar (E56:14)
      [you-SRESS entrust-FUT-PTP]               one new     job      'a new job that will be entrusted to you'When this preference is in conflict with the preference that the Genitive NP
should be the first constituent of the NP (14.4.1.), both orders are possible,
and the order which causes least ambiguity in the context wins out.

14.4.3. The position of demonstratives, adjectives, and numeralsThe position of demonstratives, adjectives, and numerals with respect to
each other seems to be quite free, except that the demonstrative may not fol-
low the numeral. The demonstrative may precede or follow the adjective:(694) a. i     güzel             ciikw-er

14.5. The adjective phrase14.5.1. Adjectival valenceThere are a substantial number of adjectives that have an oblique argument
(in addition to their subject argument, i.e. the argument toward which they
are oriented and which they modify). What follows is a list of the most
common adjectives that take an oblique argument, accompanied by a few
examples for their use. Oblique adjectival arguments always precede the ad-
jective.
   For zero-argument adjectives in subjectless copular clauses, see!7.3.","[280, 281, 282, 283, 284]"
"Such conclusions sometimes occur in the form of questions expecting a pos-
itive answer:(626) Ak' ita-ji-la,          gila kwe-qh                   blektrik.di-n          ekw       ze-da    man?

"
21.6.4. Purpose clauses with luhuz/lahana + OptativeIn this type of purpose clause, the verb is in the Optative form. The purpose
meaning arises in the following way: Ά does B, saying: May C do D!' gives
rise to 'A does Β in order for C to do D'. Such purpose clauses always have a
subject that is not identical to any of the arguments of the superordinate
clause. As in the case of luhuz/lahana      in causal clauses (cf. 21.5.3.), such
purpose clauses express a highly subjective motivation. A literal translation
with 'saying' is often not very far from the correct sense, cf. (1094).",[413]
"   However, there are certain conditions under which non-verb-final order
in independent sentences is possible or even required. One such condition
is in reporting clauses where the object argument represents direct speech.
This appears to be something of a literary convention (much like in
English), but in narrative prose writing it is practically exceptionless. The
reporting verb follows the direct speech immediately, followed by other
constituents of the clause.(812) a. Bedel,      sa    mani       lah, —            teklif-na          Abil.a. (Q81:114)

          — said Rahman, putting his arm on Ali's shoulder.' (J89:27)This convention is so strong that it is followed even when the reporting
verb is not strictly speaking a speech act verb.",[319]
"Since Lezgian prefers verb-final word order, background-first constructions
as in (975) are more common. They cannot always be translated by English
wh-cleft sentences. For example, when the focus is a focus of a focus particle
or the focus of a parametric question, as in (977), a wh-cleft is impossible in
English.(977) a. Ana         k'walax-aj-di        sa zun ja-ni? (HQ89:13)

"   Another reason for reversing the normal subject-first order may be the
heaviness of an argument. Heavy arguments tend to be placed at the margin
of the clause, i.e. clause-initially in verb-final clauses.

1.3.2. Structure of the grammarThe structure of this grammar follows the well-established traditional order:
phonology — morphology — syntax — texts. This ensures that the amount
of information that is presupposed in a given section but comes later in the
book is minimized.
   The morphological chapters deal with the form and the meaning of the
grammatical items of the language. For inflectional categories, the inflection
as a whole is first described, followed by a description of the meanings of the
individual inflectional categories. For derivational categories, form and
meaning are treated together.
   While the morphology takes the analytical perspective (from form to
function), the syntax takes the synthetic perspective (from function to form),
with chapter topics such as coordination, relative clauses, complement
clauses, adverbial clauses, coreference, questions, and comparison. All these
are taken as functional notions. For example, participial relative clauses and
correlative relative clauses show no formal similarities, but they are treated
together in Ch. 19 because of their similar function.
   Thus, this grammar to some extent fulfills the theoretical requirement to
present the grammatical information both from an analytical and from a
synthetic perspective (von der Gabelentz 1901, Lehmann 1980). For example,
the functions of the Dative case are described twice: First from an analytical
perspective in the chapter on nominal inflection (7.2.2.4.); and then from a
synthetic perspective in the sections on verbal valence (15.3.2., 15.4.1.), on
adjectival valence (14.5.1.1.), and on spatial and temporal adverbials
(16.3.1.1., 16.3.2.1.). Similarly, the functions of the Aorist converb are de-
scribed twice: First in the chapter on verbal inflection (9.9.4.), and then in
the sections on adverbial clauses (21.1.) and on complement clauses (20.6.1.-
2.). Sometimes only cross-references are made to avoid unnecessary repeti-
tions.
   However, this grammar, too, has an analytical bias. Not everything is de-
scribed from a synthetic point of view. For example, there is no function-to-
form treatment of tense meanings, or of number meanings. For such phe-
nomena, the form-to-function description must suffice.
10   1. Introduction1.3.3. Grammatical terminologyAnother feature that contributes to the user-friendliness of this grammar is
the avoidence of opaque grammatical category labels such as ""5th Elative
case"" or ""3rd Past tense"". Instead, grammatical labels with some mnemonic
descriptive content have been chosen, such as ""Superelative case"" and ""Past
Perfect"". This meant that traditional Lezgian terminology had to be aban-
doned in several cases. However, the traditional terminology itself is by no
means uniform. For example, Gajdarov's (1987a) textbook differs substan-
tially from the earlier standard accounts of Talibov & GadZiev (1966) and
Mejlanova (1967). Other works such as Zirkov (1941) and Moor (1985) use
still different terms.
   The following table is a comparative list of the most important terms that
are most widespread in Russian-language studies of Lezgian and of the ter-
minology used in this grammar (my terminology is closest to Mel'iuk's
1988a).","[29, 30]"

"7.3.1. Derivational suffixesThe following derivational suffixes will be treated here. Only the first three
are native, the others were borrowed and have not become truly productive.  -wal                     abstract nouns (from adjectives and nouns)
  -wi                      nouns of origin (from place names)
  -qhan                    profession (from nouns)
  -hi                      profession (from nouns)       (Turkic)

ductive. It forms abstract nouns from qualitative adjectives (cf. 227) and
from nouns (cf. 228), and in a few cases from adverbs (cf. 229).(227)    qacu-wal           greenness             qacu              green

(229)   aguz-wal           'lowness, lowland'     aguz             'low (adv.)'   The suffix -wal on nouns denoting a profession or function is also so
regular and common that it could perhaps be regarded as an inflectional suf-
fix. In order to express 'work as an X', one has to use it: X-wal awun (lit. 'do
X-hood'), or X-wile k'walaxun (lit. 'work in X-hood'), e.g.          muallimwal
awun 'work as a teacher', regiixbanwile k'walaxun 'work as a miller'. That
-wile in such constructions is a sort of ""functive case"" suffix can be seen in
examples like (230), where -wile is added to a plural noun.",[125]
"
23.3.2. ""Indirect questions"" used as independent sentencesSentences whose main verb is in the Conditional mood can also be used as
independent sentences and express hesitating questions, self-addressed ques-
tions (Ί wonder...'), and statements with low probability. They can perhaps
be regarded as ""indirect questions used as independent sentences"".
(However, such ""independent indirect questions"" of the alternative type dif-
fer from indirect alternative questions, where the Conditional mood is not
used, cf. 23.3.1.3. above.)  ""Polar questions"":(1202) a. Ewer-α         kwan     ada-z, —            bujrug     ga-na            pafah.di,

22.4.1. Syntactic function of the antecedentThe antecedent of the reflexive pronoun must occupy a prominent syntactic
position. For instance, it cannot be the direct object or a possessor when the
reflexive pronoun is the subject:(1139) a. *Wi6i         Ali   gata-zwa.

a non-subject argument or a noun modifier. Example (1140) shows an
Absolutive subject antecedent, and (1141) shows Ergative subject an-
tecedents.","[428, 429]"

1.3.1. User-friendly featuresAn attempt has been made to make this grammar maximally user-friendly
even for readers who need a particular piece of information (e.g. for a cross-
linguistic investigation) and have no time to wade through the whole
grammar. This grammar has the following features that make it easy to use
as a reference work:
   (A) Morpheme-by-morpheme glosses with brackets marking subordinate
clauses for better readability (cf. 1.3.5.).
   (B) A detailed subject index which, in addition to normal entries referring
to places in the book, contains entries that do not occur elsewhere in the
book. Such entries are names of grammatical phenomena that do not occur
in the language. Thus, looking up the subject index suffices to find out that
Lezgian has no passive, no dual, no tones. There are of course no negative
statements about these categories in the grammar, and since the mere ab-
sence of a category in the index proves nothing, the negative information in
the index might be useful.
   (C) An index to the example sentences. Since the examples (most of
which were taken from original Lezgian texts) usually show other interest-
ing phenomena in addition to the point which they illustrate in the particu-
lar place in the text, such an index makes a lot of additional information
available. By looking up the number of an example in the index, the reader
                                          1.3. A user's guide to this grammar   9can find up to twenty more examples elsewhere in the grammar that illus-
trate the same point.
   (D) A more or less complete bibliography of scholarly works on Lezgian.
Most of these are not mentioned in the text, but a reader who is interested
in further information or different points of view is given the chance to
look them up. The subject index simultaneously serves as an index to the
bibliography. This step was taken so as not to clutter the text with references
that few readers will find useful because most of the publications are diffi-
cult to get outside of Daghestan.
   (E) An index to the grammatical morphemes of Lezgian.","[28, 29]"
"     V (TABS, L A D V)                   V (A E R G , TABS, L a d v )        (15.3.14.)   In addition, there are two groups of ""non-standard valence patterns"". In
the first group, there is a Dative argument with subject properties (15.4.1.),
and in the second group, the Absolutive argument has been incorporated
into the verb so that there is no Absolutive argument in the valence pattern
(""Absolutive absorption"", 15.4.2.1.).
   The valence patterns of verbs that take clausal arguments (=complement
clauses) have not been taken into account here. For such complement-tak-
ing verbs, see Ch. 20.
   The general principles to which Lezgian valence patterns conform
(especially (i)-(v) above) are not particularly exotic or exceptional. Aside
from Ergativity, there are only two features that set Lezgian off from the fa-
miliar European languages: Dative experiencers and consistent Absolutive
270   15. Verbal valence
themes. Thus, in an experiential verb like akun 'see' and other experiential
expressions (cf. 15.4.1.), the experiencer is expressed in the Dative case:(719) Zamira.di-z      Diana        aku-na.
      Zamita-DAT       Diana       see-AOR
      'Zamira saw Diana, (lit. Diana was visible to Zamira.)'And themes are consistently in the Absolutive case, even where a patient
argument is also present and would be the direct object in the familiar
European languages. In Lezgian, this patient is expressed in one of the local
cases. For example, the patient arguments of the verbs 'stroke' and 'sweep'
appear in the Adelative and Superelative cases, respectively, in the follow-
ing examples (an analogous example is (717) above).","[289, 290]"
"(720) Emirmet.a       qhilqw.e-waj      gil     giic'-na. (Q81:113)
      Emirmet(ERG)    cheek-ADEL         hand   stroke-AOR

      'Aminat swept the room with a broom.' (Lit. 'Aminat swept the
      broom through the room.')In the familiar European languages, the Lezgian local patients have to be
rendered as direct objects, and the Lezgian Absolutive themes correspond to
instrumental phrases. These instrumental phrases sound somewhat redun-
dant in the translations of (720M721) because the verbal actions ('stroke',
'sweep') are such that they are exclusively or typically carried out with these
instruments. But this is not the case in Lezgian because quite generally verb
meaning is more general than in the familiar European languages. For ex-
ample, gilc'un not only means 'stroke', but also 'wipe' (stoldiwaj pek giic'un
'wipe a table with a cloth') or 'rub', and elägun not only means 'sweep', but
also 'wave (with a cap)' and 'nod (one's head)'.
   These characteristics of Lezgian valence patterns can be generalized and
we can say that Lezgian shows a tendency toward a closer correspondence
between semantic roles and case-marking: Agents are always in the Ergative
case, themes are always in the Absolutive, recipients and experiencers are
always in the Dative, patients are always in one of the local cases. This is in
marked contrast to the familiar European languages, where nominative
subjects can be agents, themes, experiencers, and sometimes even patients,
accusative direct objects can be themes, patients, or experiencers, etc. It is
true that there are exceptions in Lezgian as well; for instance, the Absolutive
argument of kiligun (CABS/ DDAT) ' C looks at D' would appear to be an agent
rather than a theme, and Lezgian also has metaphorical expressions like i
banka.di pud litr q'ada (Talibov & Gad2iev 1966:207) 'this can holds three
liters'. But it cannot be denied that there is a tendency toward a closer link
between semantic roles and case-marking, so that we can call Lezgian a
""role-dominated language"" (cf. Foley & Van Valin 1984, A. E. Kibrik 1980b).

"This is thus a sort of syntactic switch-reference system in which the
Infinitive is the same subject form and the Aorist converb is the different
subject form. This criterion clearly shows that the 'direct object' Absolutive
behaves differently from the Ergative and and Absolutive subject:(807) *Musa.di-z       dide.di           seher.di-z      raqur-iz       k'an-zawa.

plement clauses, each of which is described in one of the sections of this
chapter. In principle, the complement-taking verb determines which com-
plement-forming strategy is chosen, and the strategy has to be given in the
dictionary. However, the choice of complement-forming strategies is to a
large extent predictable from the meaning of the verb and the complement
clause. Roughly, the zero strategy (20.1.) is used for direct speech, the
Infinitive (20.2.) is used for irrealis complements, the Masdar (20.3.) is used
for complements with action meaning, the substantivized participle (20.4.)
is used for factive complements, the luhunCsay') strategy (20.5.) is used for
non-factive propositional-attitude verbs, the converb strategy (20.6.) is used
for verbs of perception, and the ii-strategy (20.7.) is used to extrapose com-
plements of several different types.
   The subject of complement clauses is often omitted under identity with
an argument of the main clause (i.e. it is controlled by one of the main
clause arguments). To facilitate the recognition of the control relations, each
of the relevant sections in this chapter contains at least one example where
the relations are made explicit notationally. The omitted target is repre-
sented by a 0 (zero), and both the target and its controller are underlined.
See also 22.3. for some discussion of control in complement clauses.
   The use of the terms ""subject"" and ""object"" for controllers and targets in
this chapter is not unproblematic; see 16.1. for some discussion.","[373, 374]"
"22.2. Controller and target of omission in adverbial clauses
In the overwhelming majority of cases, the target of coreferential omission
is the subject, i.e. the Ergative, intransitive Absolutive, or Dative experi-
encer argument. This is illustrated in (1126-1135) below. In exceptional cases,
the transitive Absolutive argument (the direct object) may be omitted under
coreference, as in (1124). This seems to be possible only when the Ergative
argument is inanimate and therefore is not a typical subject.",[424]
"
20.2.4. Object-controlled complementsThe Infinitive subject is controlled by the main-clause Adelative argument
with the verb tun 'make, cause'. This verb is the standard way to express
causative situations. It is sometimes treated as a ""causative auxiliary"" (e.g.
Uslar 1896, Moor 1985), but there is no reason not to regard it as an ordinary
complement-taking verb.",[378]

"  Aorist converbs also allow a special construction where both the subject
and the direct object of a verb are omitted under coreference.(1133) a. Gada-jr.i            6'exi-bur.u           ±iz    gil-er q'u-na                 öüq'we-na.

the first or to the second verb, i.e. whether an analysis as in (1134a) or an
analysis as in (1134b) is correct.(1134) a. Gadajri [gileri        q'una]     0t      öüq'wena.

"3.2.1.1. The status of the phoneme /»/. In the standard language /ae/ is
comparatively rare in stems and occurs only in one suffix (-äj, the Inelative
of front-vowel stems). In many dialects it is more frequent and is
pharyngealized to a greater or lesser degree (Kodzasov 1986:33-34,
Mejlanova 1964). Most roots in which it occurs are loans of Arabic origin
with an Arabic pharyngeal consonant (Ϊ or h)), e.g.:(24) sät               'hour; clock'      Arabic:         saaiat
     t'äm              'taste'                         ίαΐτη

may be due to the spelling system (/ae/ is represented by the Cyrillic letter
<H>, which at the beginning of a word has the value /ja/, see 3.1.1.3.). All
words that begin with /ae/ in the Güne dialect begin with /e/ in the standard
language (Mejlanova 1970:22), e.g.:(25) elqiln         /el'qyn/        'turn'      Güne dialect:           /ael'qyn/
     exun           /'εχιιη/        'suffer'                            /'εεχιιη/However, even in the standard language /ae/ occurs in a couple of words that
seem to be native, e.g.:(26)   näni         /'naeni/        'evening'
       härq'ü       /hasr'q'y/      'wide'
32    3. Segmental phonological units/as/ also occurs in a group of verbs ending 'm.-äg'un (combinations of
different preverbs with the verb jagun 'hif, cf. 10.3.):
(27) kägun        /'khaeKun/     'touch'
     elägun       /e'laeKun/     'take off'

     ek'ägun      /e'k'acKun/    'pour'3.2.1.2. The long vowels fan/ and /as/. These two phonemes have a rather
marginal status. They occur in those forms of the verbs jagun 'hit' and the
verbs in -ägun in (27) which lose the /κ/ before suffixes beginning with a
consonant (see below 5.12.). The long vowels are thus the result of
compensatory lengthening.(28) jagun        /'jaKun/       'hit'
     ja-zawa      /'jaizawa/     'is hitting'            (< VjaKzawa/)

     xkä-nawa     /^kae:nawa/    'has chosen'            (< */'%kasKnawa/)Furthermore, -a/ and -φ' in suffixes are often pronounced as /a'J and /aε:/
respectively (Gajdarov 1960:249, Mejlanova 1964), e.g.(29) fizwaj      /'fizwatf       'was goingf
     kardikaj    /'khardikhaV    'about the matter'
     atajla      /a'ta:la/       'when...came'
     rik'äj      /ri'k'ae:/      'out of the heart'However, this pronunciation is not obligatory, and a pronunciation closer
to the spelling is also possible, especially in careful speech.","[51, 52]"
"   However, since the information conveyed by the personal pronoun is
very often recoverable from the context, the anaphoric pronoun can also be
omitted. This type of pronoun dropping is particularly frequent in dialogs
and in informal narratives. It occurs much more rarely in more formal
styles such as newspaper articles or technical texts. In the following exam-
ples, pronoun dropping is indicated by square brackets in the translations.(1118) a. Sa      ara.di-laj      Safiga        rak'-ar.i-qΛ      fe-na.       Amma             rak'-ar-a

10.6.2. Types of noun-verb compoundsMost aumn-compounds are combinations of awun with a noun denoting
an action or the result of an action. The meaning in such compounds is
quite straightforward: 'perform the action denoted by the base noun', as in
(408). Many of these action nouns are loanwords of Arabic origin. This is the
only way of borrowing verbal notions from Arabic.(408) silhbet awun    'converse'       sühbet         'conversation'
      ikram awun      'greef           ikram          'greeting'
      teklif awun     'invite'         teklif         'invitation'
      hiss awun       'feel'           hiss           'feeling'Russian verbs are also borrowed in this way. Awun is added to the Russian
infinitive form:(409) klassificirovat' awun            'classify'
      mobilizovat' awun                'mobilize'
      likvidirovat' awun               'liquidate'However, often a Russian verbal noun is chosen as a base for a Lezgian
aumn-compound:(410) zakaz awun              'order'           (Ru. zakaz          'order')
      registracija awun       'register'        (Ru. registracija   'registration')
      otkaz awun              'refuse, deny'    (Ru. otkaz          'denial')
      perevod awun            'translate'       (Ru. perevod        'translation')
                                                   10.6. Verbal compounds        181  Awun-compounds may also be based on a reduplicated noun. Such verbs
have the meanings 'cover with Xs', 'turn (tr.) into Xs' (the corresponding
fun-compound means 'be covered with Xs', 'turn (intr.) into Xs').(411) leke-leke awun     'cover with spots""          leke     'spof
      pad-pad    awun    ""break into pieces'         pad      'parf
      c'arx-c'arx awun   'cover with scratches'      c'arx    'scratch'
      biZger-bizger awun 'tear to shreds'            biZger   'piece of cloth'
      t'ekw-t'ekw awun 'riddle with holes'           t'ekw    'hole'   Another very common base for awun-compounds are ideophones, espe-
cially reduplicated onomatopoetic expressions, e.g.(412) a. C!V(r)C2
         murr-murr awun             purr
         ö'arx-ö'arx awun          'crunch'
         zirt'-iirt' awun          'squelch'
         ziw-ziw awun              'clink'
         tax-tax awun              'knock, rumble'        C1V1C2rV1C2
        t'aq'raq' awun             'crunch'
        wiSriS awun                'rustle'
        bagrag awun                'rumble'
        leSreS awun                'splash'
        6'wäq'räq' awun            'snap, crack'  In some cases the base does not occur on its own, but only in combination
with awun a n d / o r £un, e.g.(413) zelb awun     'concentrate (tr.)'
      zelb Stun     'concentrate (intr.)'
      *2elb
      terg awun     'destroy7
      terg 5tu η    'perish'
      *tergSuch pairs of verbs look much like transitive/anticausative pairs (cf. 10.2.),
e.g. xkaiun 'raise' / xkai Zun 'rise'. They crucially differ from them in that
the transitive member may occur in the full form, e.g. ielb awun (besides
zelbun), whereas there is no full form in transitive members of transi-
tive/anticausative pairs (*xkai awun).
   In many cases both an au;un-compound and a f u n - c o m p o u n d can be
formed from the same noun. The meaning of the fun-compound is often,
but not always, 'undergo the action denoted by the base noun'. The forma-
tion of fun-compounds from nouns denoting actions is not as common as
the formation of awun-compounds. It is not clear what semantic properties
of the base noun make the derivation of a fun-compound possible.

      tabdil £un           'change (intr.)'Instances where a iun-compound is possible but the corresponding awun-
compound does not exist are very rare.
   A wu η -compounds can also be formed from plural forms of nouns. The
meaning of such verbs emphasizes the duration or frequency of the action.(415) ixtilatar awun          'converse a lot'   ixtilat      'conversation'
      (ixtilatarun)
      zarafatar     awun      'joke a lof         zarafat     'joke'
      (zarafatarun)
      q'iiler awun            'dance a lot'      q'ill        'dance'
      (q'illerun)Such a wu η-compounds can also be formed from the plural form of the
nominal Masdar (cf. 9.9.1.). The resulting verb is then something like a du-
rative or frequentative version of the simple verb. However, such cases are
not frequent.","[200, 201, 202]"

"Not only the Ergative subject of transitive verbs can be freely omitted with
the same interpretation, but also the Absolutive subject of intransitive

fix that also occurs in the inflection of non-compound weak verbs. This
surprising fact can be explained in different ways. Three explanations are
considered here.
   (A) The hypothesis that is most widespread among Lezgian linguists is
that all weak verbs were originally compounds of noun + awun. The differ-
ence between non-compound weak verbs and a w u n - c o m p o u n d s would
then be that non-compound verbs now only occur in the reduced form.
However, there is no evidence that nouns like *ha£ 'entering (?)', *jag
'hitting (?)', *kilig 'looking (?)', which one would have to postulate for an
earlier period, ever existed (cf. häZun 'enter', jägun 'hif, kiligun 'look').
Three further more specific points argue against this view:
   (i) Aumn-compounds always preserve the Ergative marking of their sub-
ject (cf. 15.4.2.1.), even if they have no direct object, whereas simple verbs
take an Absolutive subject when they are intransitive.
   (ii) Not in all cases can the reduced form be obtained by simple phonolog-
ical reduction of the relevant form of awun. In particular, the Aorist par-
ticiple form is puzzling for this hypothesis. It should be something like
*k'walax-ur (< k'walax awur), not k'walax-aj.
    (iii) In a few cases, the addition of a prefix leads to a change from strong
verb to weak verb, e.g. αί'ύη 'cut' (strong), but xk-ät'un 'cut (out)' (weak);
aq'ün 'hit upon' (strong), but ag-äq'un 'reach' (weak); wehin            'throw'
(strong), but q^iwihun 'throw again' (see 10.4.1., (A)). Such cases show that
180   10. Verbal derivationthe strong/weak distinction has a lot to do with stress: Verbs whose root has
more than one syllable can only be weak because stress cannot be on the
third syllable.
   (B) Another possible explanation would be that zero-affixation or conver-
sion is a productive process in Lezgian that has more or less the same func-
tion as compounding with awun. According to this hypothesis, the
""reduced au>un-compounds"" would not be az/mn-compounds at all; they
would be synonymous parallel formations. This explanation (which has not
to my knowledge been advocated) cannot account for the fact that the func-
tions and the domain of the two hypothesized word-formation rules are
virtually the same, nor does it capture native speakers' intutions (reflected
in poetic examples like (407a) above) that the reduced form is in fact an ab-
breviated variant of the full form.
   (C) I opt for an explanation in terms of convergence: The inflectional pat-
tern of the reduced form of awun-compounds turned out to be so similar to
the existing pattern of weak verbs that it was subsequently completely as-
similated to it (i.e., the Aorist participle *k'walax auiur > *k'walax-ur be-
came *k'walax-aj by analogy with hä£-aj etc.).","[199, 200]"
"2.3. The status of Lezgian and the standard language
Until the second half of the 19th century, Lezgian was only used in speech
and oral literature. The language of religion, bureaucracy, jurisdiction
(shariah), and inscriptions (especially on houses and gravestones) was
Arabic, as in all of Daghestan. When Daghestan and Azerbaijan became part
of the Russian empire, Russian replaced Arabic as the language of govern-
ment.
   In the second half of the 19th century, poets such as Jetim Emin (a classic
whose poetry is still widely read), Jetim Melik, Said Koöxürskij began to
write down their poetry, using the Arabic script.
   In the 1860s and 1870s, the Russian general staff officer Baron Petr
Karlovif Uslar, in what is perhaps the greatest military achievement in his-
tory, laid the foundations of Nakho-Daghestanian and Abkhazo-Adyghean
linguistics by producing excellent descriptions of seven languages of the
northern Caucasus, among them Lezgian (Uslar 1896). Uslar created an al-
phabet for Lezgian on the basis of the Russian Cyrillic alphabet. His Lezgian
informant, Kazanfar-beg, tried to spread the knowledge of this alphabet
among the Lezgians. A textbook was produced (Kazanfar-Beg 1871, reedited
by A. Mamedov 1911), but these attempts at establishing a written language
were not successful.
   After the Bolsheviks took power in the early 1920s, the official language
policy at first favored the use of Turkic (Azerbaijani) in Daghestan. But in
the second half of the 1920s, it was decided to provide several Daghestanian
languages with written standards, among them Lezgian. The Lezgian alpha-
bet, which was officially introduced in 1928, was based on the Latin alphabet,
24   2. Lezgian and its speakerslike the alphabets of the other newly written languages of the Soviet Union.
Particularly active in this early phase of the standard language were
Gadiibek Gadiibekov (or HeZibegen HeZibeg; cf. GadZibekov 1932, haiibegof
1928, Haiibegov 1934, heZibegen 1931, he2ibegov 1931; the spelling variants
of Gad2ibekov's name show the lack of standardization at that time) and
Abdulkadir Alkadarskij (cf. Alq'adarskij 1934,1939-41, Alkadarskij 1932).
   The new standard language was based on the Küre dialect (or, more
specifically, on the Güne dialect of the Küre dialect group). According to
Gajdarov (1962), there were three reasons for choosing this dialect: First, this
dialect is spoken by the largest number of speakers; second, it was well-
known through the work of the famous poets Jetim Emin and St'al
Sulejman (Sulejman Stal'skij), who were speakers of that dialect; and third,
the only linguistic description of Lezgian available at that time, Uslar's
(1896) grammar, was based on a dialect of the Küre dialect group. One might
add that the Küre dialect is spoken in the geographically more accessible
lowlands and was therefore more likely to be known by speakers from the
high-mountain areas than vice versa.
   In 1938, the official alphabet was replaced by a new alphabet based on the
Cyrillic alphabet, in line with a decision taken in Moscow for all the new
written languages of the Soviet Union. Rules for Lezgian spelling were pub-
lished for the first time in 1938 (GadZiev & Alkadarskij 1938), and the first
orthographic dictionary was published in 1941 (GadZiev 1941). Magomed
Gadiiev's comprehensive Russian-Lezgian dictionary (Gadiiev 1950) had an
enormous influence on the development of the written language.
   Since the Lezgian standard language was officially introduced, Lezgian
has been taught at several levels of education, including higher education
(at the Chair of Daghestanian Languages of the Daghestanian State
University in Maxaikala). Publications in Lezgian include textbooks on
Lezgian grammar and literature, children's literature, poetry, fiction, several
journals and newspapers. There is also some radio broadcasting in Lezgian,
and there is a Lezgian-language theater in Derbent.
   Despite these relatively favorable conditions, there are clear signs of the
decline of Lezgian (cf. also the retention figures in 2.1.1.). Where parents
have the possibility to choose between Lezgian-language instruction in
school and Russian-language instruction, many have been choosing
Russian as the language that opens up greater possibilities for their children.
The medium of instruction in the city schools is exclusively Russian, and
the Daghestanian languages are not even taught as a subject. In Maxaikala,
Russian is the dominating language outside of the home, and it is increas-
ingly used even at home by the younger generation, not only in families
with linguistically mixed marriages.
   The resurgence of national self-awareness in the wake of the liberation
from the totalitarian regime in the late 1980s has recently created some new
interest in the native languages (as well as Arabic), but it remains to be seen
whether it will lead to a reversal of the pattern of slow decline of Lezgian.
However, there is no threat whatever in the rural areas of Lezgistan, where
until today quite a few speakers (mainly women) are monolingual. As long
as the Lezgians remain in their traditional settlement areas, Lezgian is not
an endangered language.

2.4. The effect of language contact on Lezgian
The most important contact languages in the historical period have been
Turkic (in particular, Azerbaijani), Arabic, Persian, and Russian. Only
Russian and Azerbaijani contacts are still in effect today. Contact with
Arabic and Persian came to a halt in the 1920s with the Sovietization of
Daghestan and Azerbaijan.
   As in many languages of traditionally Muslim populations, Arabic loan-
words play an eminent role in the Lezgian vocabulary. Not only most reli-
gious terms, but also many abstract and intellectual words are of Arabic ori-
gm, e.g.","[43, 44, 45]"
"   Adverbial clauses show several kinds of formal marking:
   (A) Special verbal affixes, called converbs: -(i)z, -na, -la, -waldi, -nmazdi,
-rdawaj,    -daldi.
   (B) Postpositions governing noun clauses of the substantivized participle
type (20.4.) or the Masdar type (20.3.): q'uluqh 'after', iniqh 'since', patal 'in
order to'. When used in this way, the postpositions could also be regarded as
subordinating conjunctions.
   (C) Nouns with very general meaning which are the heads of participial
relative clauses: ö'awuz 'at the time (when)'.
   (D) The Conditional mood marker -t'a (9.3.4.3., 9.8.5.), suffixed to a finite
verb or to an Aorist participle.
   (E) Subordinating conjunctions that introduce the clause. These are loans
from Persian, and only eger 'if is widely used.
   (F) luhuz llahana, converbs of luhun 'say'.
   The subject of adverbial clauses is often omitted under co-reference with
a noun phrase of the superordinate clause. See 22.2. for details.
376   21. Adverbial clauses
21.1. Adverbial clauses with the Aorist converbThe Aorist converb is used to express chains of actions carried out by the
same subject. Such sentences often have to be translated by means of coor-
dinate clauses in English because the action of the converb clause is often
not backgrounded to the same extent as the English participle would sug-
gest.(1049) a. Nabal'nik.di,         sehne.di-z        eqei'-na         öa-z         wiri-da-z

           (DD71,3:21)  Such chains are usually not long — examples involving more than one

An appositional proper name (as in (673-676)) may itself be modified by a

      'Zühre's father Khan Rustam'   In more traditional Lezgian, a Lezgian surname is treated as an apposi-
tion of the given name and therefore precedes it:(680) a. Mühüdinova            Alfija Meharamdxür.ü-n                     Skola.di-n

use of the reflexive pronoun shows that we are dealing with indirect speech.(984) a. Gada.di       dide.di-z,       wie     Seher.di-z      fi-da          laha-na.

the following show that the direct-indirect speech division is not as sharp in
Lezgian as in the familiar languages.(985) a. Belki     nilk'.re    wiöi-z        sa k'us       fu    ce                luhu-zwa-t'a?

20.2. The InfinitiveThe infinitive is used mainly in complement clauses with irrealis modality,
i.e. complement clauses whose complement modality does not imply the
realization of the complement situation. The irrealis modality can be either
PROSPECTIVE (i.e. the realization of the situation is expected for the future)
or POTENTIAL (i.e. the realization is not expected for a particular moment in
the future but is possible anytime).
    The subject of the Infinitival complement clause is generally omitted
under referential identity with the subject of the main clause ( S U B J E C T
356   20. C o m p l e m e n t c l a u s e s
CONTROL) or in one case {tun, the causative verb) with the Adelative object
of the main clause (OBJECT CONTROL). An exception are complements to the
one-place verb baSlamiSun 'begin' (20.2.5.), which have their own subject.
The following sections consist of lists of valence patterns with Infinitival
complements and illustrative examples that instantiate the various types.","[374, 375, 376]"
"   Since Lezgian participles are not inherently oriented, the Absolutive sub-
ject of the predicative substantivized participle construction does not have
to correspond to the participle's subject. Example (966) shows sentences
where the subject corresponds to the participle's Absolutive direct object.
Such sentences are best translated by passive sentences, but the Lezgian con-
struction is not passive at all.
