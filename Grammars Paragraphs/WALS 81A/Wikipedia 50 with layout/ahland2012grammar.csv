5.1    The Noun Phrase
       The noun phrase (NP) in Gumuz can be comprised of a head noun, whether
independent or part of the Associative or Attributive Constructions (described in Chapter
VII), a numeral, a relative clause, a genitive noun/ noun phrase, a prepositional phrase
and/or a demonstrative adjective. While the NP tends to be left-headed, the order of
constituents within the phrase is fairly free. The only constituents with a fixed word
order are those that occur within the Attributive and/or Associative Constructions. This
section also describes the respective categories and inflectional/derivational morphology
of the various non-head constituents of the NP.",[159]
"               ‘They formed a circle in order to kill and get the dikdik.’13.6.2 Different-Subject Purpose Clauses
       Different-subject purpose clauses in Gumuz have the same structure as finite
same-subject purpose clauses. The finite purpose clause in SoG is marked as a
‘dependent’ clause (13.41). When the object of the matrix verb is the same as that of the
purpose clause in NoG, the /-(â)n/ suffix is not marked on the purpose clause regardless
of whether the subject of the matrix is the same as (13.35), or different from (13.40), the
purpose clause.",[475]

construction. This latter object complement form varies in finiteness depending on the
matrix verb and on whether the verb of the complement clause has the same subject or
different subject from the matrix verb. By “finite” I mean that the verb can be inflected
with bound subject pronominals (found in finite verbs), and the relative order of verbal
morphemes (both inflectional and derivational) follows that of finite main clause verbs
(Chapter VII).","[387, 388]"

             ‘He brought (it) with those thick books.’It appears as though one marks the constituents of dependent noun phrases in Gumuz in
order to clarify which elements are constituents of the particular noun phrase and which
are not. This is especially true when the word order is non-canonical. Thus, if each
constituent in the dative prepositional phrase ‘to those two houses’ in example (5.63)
were not marked with the dative preposition, the numeral ‘two’, which atypically follows
the demonstrative adjective in (5.63), would be reinterpreted as the S argument — as in
(5.65). Thus, ‘two’ no longer refers to ‘houses’ but stands as the subject of the
intransitive clause.","[177, 178]"

           In SoG, a finite form of the ma- construction is used for different-subject
   complement clauses. These complements are finite in that they take bound subject
   pronominals which indicate transitivity by their tonal melodies. The relative order of
   morphemes following the verb root in this construction (both inflectional and derivational)
   is the same as for future tense main clause verbs (see Chapter VII). This complement
   construction may be limited to complements of the verb ‘want’. The majority of
   examples of different subject complements in the corpus include a /ká-/ prefix as part of
   the construction.",[395]

clause must follow the verb of the purpose clause; no other order is acceptable regardless
of the presence or non-presence of the /-(â)n/ suffix (13.37). Furthermore, the same-
subject complement can also be expressed as a non-finite complement (13.38).","[473, 474]"

10.7. Case Marking Alignment in Simple Clauses
       Transitive constituent order in Gumuz tends to vary between AVP and APV.
However, other constituent orders are also possible depending on the discourse context.
Likewise, constituent order in intransitives varies between SV and VS.
       Core arguments in Gumuz remain unmarked for case unless the A/S argument
follows the verb, in which situation the A/S is marked with a nominative case marker /á-/
and the P remains unmarked. According to König (2006: 658), such a pattern of
alignment is a type 1 marked nominative language with a split system. A language is
considered to have a marked nominative system if it exhibits a nominative-accusative
pattern (the coding of A and S is the same) and the nominative (A/S) is marked for case
while the accusative (P) remains unmarked (Comrie 1989). The Gumuz marked
nominative system is ‘split’ in that the nominative is marked only under special
circumstances (i.e postverbal A/S but not preverbal A/S, and for emphasis). Examples
(10.71)-(10.83) below demonstrate various attested constituent orders in both NoG and
SoG. The transitive orders are: AVP, APV, PVA, VAP, and VPA. The intransitive
orders are SV and VS. Case marking is obligatory when the A/S argument is post-verbal.

        Other syntactic evidence for incorporation in Gumuz can be found in both word
order and nominalization. As demonstrated in Chapter X, various word orders are
attested in Gumuz. That is, the O argument is not required to follow the verb. However,
the IN must follow the verb root (and be phonologically reduced, if applicable) in order
for each clause to convey the same meaning. In (8.31) versus (8.32) below, the meaning
of the sentence changes if the noun is uttered before the verb or if it is uttered in its non-
reduced form.

  The lexical item cá ‘seed’ requires an inherent possession marker in northern Gumuz dialects when used
as an independent noun (see Chapter III). However, in the southern dialects, cá ‘seed, eye’ can be uttered
as an independent noun without the possessive marker.","[285, 286]"

                  ‘I will give to you all.’         In SoG, simultaneous incorporation of the dative and marking of the object of the
dative appears to be restricted to the imperative and jussive verb constructions (7.124,
7.125),22 and verbs conjugated in the future tense which function as commands (7.126).23                  SoG

                  ‘You will/should show me.’         When the dative preposition and the object of the dative are both incorporated
into the verb, a prepositional phrase expressing the same dative and object never co-
occurs in the same clause. Thus, in terms of expression of free NP or PP “arguments,”
incorporation of the dative plus its object does indeed change the valence of the verb. A
22
   The jussive construction does not follow the relative order of morphemes for the nonfuture or future
tense verbs in that subject (A/S) marking occurs before the verb root but incorporated prepositions occur
after the verb root. See Chapter XI for further description of Jussives.
23
   I am assuming that the final /g/ of tig ‘order, tell’ in (7.127) has been deleted due to haplology as the
final /g/ would be otherwise contiguous with the dative. This assumption is also based on the free variation
that exists in a similar imperative form: tiga-gá-ár-é-s ~ ti-gá-ár-é-s ‘Show me.’                                                   225
change in valency can also occur when incorporating the instrumental preposition with
certain transitive verb roots (7.128-7.130). This results in the backgrounding of what
could otherwise be expressed as a free O argument. In other words, a transitive root such
as ‘throw’ can have either a THEME (the object in motion) or a GOAL (the affected
target of the verb) as the O argument. If no GOAL is expressed, the THEME is the O
argument. However, when a GOAL is expressed, the GOAL must be marked as the O
argument and the THEME is part of an instrumental prepositional phrase. In (7.127), the
O argument, ‘monkey’ (the GOAL), who was the cause of the baboon’s ire in the
narrative, is implied. The same verb root without the incorporated instrumental can be
used transitively to treat the THEME as an O argument (7.128). This verb root can also
be expressed as a simple transitive with no overtly expressed THEME or GOAL (7.129).","[253, 254, 255]"
"
10.6.1 The Comparative Construction
        In some languages comparative constructions are comprised of a standard, a
marker, and a quality. The standard is something against which an item is being
compared, the marker marks the construction as a comparative construction, and the
quality is the attribute by which the item is being compared (Payne 1997:88-89). In NoG,
the order of these three components within the comparative construction is marker-
standard-quality (10.65, 10.66). In SoG the order is quality-marker-standard (10.67).
The comparative marker in Gumuz is the preposition /ká=/. Also distinctive is the order
of the demonstrative adjective (where applicable) and head noun within the NP
expressing the standard in the NoG. In (10.66), the demonstrative adjective precedes the
noun, whereas in typical NP’s in Gumuz, the demonstrative adjective follows the noun
(see section 5.1.2.3 of Chapter V).",[381]
"
12.3.1.4       Relativizing on A Arguments
       With the bare relativizer strategy, one can relativize on an A argument by simply
substituting the affirmative main clause prefix /d-/ with the relativizer /l-/ and adding H
tone to the transitive tonal melody of the bound subject pronominal. The RC is assumed
to be internally headed (12.50 b), mirroring the more typical AVO word order of Gumuz
main clauses (12.50 a).   (12.50)     a.      ɓaga d-a-ɓátʃ          ŋ́gafa
                       person AFF-3SG.TR-hit woman
                       ‘The person hit the woman.’

                       {Head}

                       ‘The person that hit the woman is here.’       It is also possible to have a headless RC using the bare relativizer /l-/ in order to
relativize on the A argument. In example (12.51), the O argument of the RC precedes the
verb, and the RC is externally headed. An /-a/ suffix is added to indicate that the NP
defore the verb is the O argument of the RC and the lexical A argument head is external
to the clause. In addition, H tone is added to the bound subject pronominal on the verb to
indicate that the clause is relativizing on an A argument. The resulting tonal pattern on
the bound subject pronominal of the transitive verb is HL. The addition of the H tone for
all other bound subject pronominals beyond the 3SG in this RC construction is not
detectable as the tonal melody for transitive non-3SG pronominals is H.",[438]

       While most inflectional and derivational morphology is similar between NoG and
SoG, there are a few categories which differ, and the relative order of morphemes on the
verb is not always the same. Both dialects have a distinct order for verbal morphology
based on whether the verb is future versus nonfuture. Furthermore, though the basic
division between ‘future’ and ‘nonfuture’ is conceptually the same, the formal marking of
tense differs quite dramatically between the two dialects, and there exists a third ‘remote
past’ tense morpheme in SoG (Uzar 1989) which occupies a position distinct from other
tense markers. Other differences are found in the marking of person and number. The
Mandura dialect of NoG marks both subject and object simultaneously on the verb (see
also Chapter IV), whereas SoG does not (however, the object of a preposition can be
marked on certain verbs). The category of ‘greater plural’ exists in NoG but does not
seem to exist in SoG. Figures 7.1 through 7.4 present tentative position class charts for
Nonfuture and Future verbs in NoG and SoG. Many of the categories cannot be
simultaneously marked on the verb and thus the relative order of certain morpheme
positions is not attested. Furthermore, Middle Voice /-áá/ must co-occur with an
Incorporated Noun/Classifier).","[211, 212]"

       However, for both NoG and SoG, a complement clause comprised of /ká-/ plus
the ma- construction is more commonly inflected. That is, the nominalized verb
resembles the structure of a finite verb in that it takes bound subject pronominals and
tonal marking for transitivity identical to that of main clause verbs. These bound subject
pronominals do not resemble the possessive pronoun suffixes found on nouns and they
occur on the complement verb regardless of whether the complement subject is the same
as or different from that of the matrix. If the subject of the matrix is different than that of
the complement, the bound subject pronominal is required on the complement; the verb
of the complement clause is thus finite, following the order of morphemes for future
tense verbs (Chapter VII). In fact, the verb in this type of complement clause is identical
in structure to SoG future tense verbs and to NoG immediate future verbs. The following
PCU matrix verbs take an inflected form of /ká-/ plus the ma- construction as their clausal
complement: ‘want’ (11.37-11.40), ‘think’ (11.41), ‘tell’ (11.42), and zaχ ‘know’ (11.43).","[396, 397]"

               NOM-PL-big- BODY person
               ‘elders (big people)’       Marking inflection on the edge of the construction might suggest that the
construction is a compound or the construction is a phrase and the inflection is more like
a phrasal affix. Indeed, the plural prefix sometimes behaves like a phrasal affix (section
3.2.1 of Ch. III). Moreover, this may be an example of the dependent noun agreeing with
the head noun in terms of number (see also section 6.2.3). Such instances of agreement
are characteristic of phrases rather than compounds (Haspelmath 2002: 90). On the other
hand, marking inflection on the edge of a construction might also suggest that the head of
the construction is on one edge (see discussion of ‘headedness’ in section 6.2.2).
       As with the Associative Construction, elements of the Attributive Construction
are syntactically inseparable. That is, the NN order is fixed. If the order changes, so also
does the construction. In other words, if the attributive noun follows the noun it is
                                            163
modifying or stands alone, it must take the /-má/ inherent possession suffix (6.21 b-d, see
also section 6.3.3). For example, ‘wet’ in (6.21) does not take the inherent possession
suffix when a part of the Attributive Construction (6.21a). However, when pulled out of
the NN construction, it must have the inherent possession suffix in order to mark its
relationship with the second noun of the construction (6.21 b-d).","[192, 193]"

12.3.1 NoG Relative Clauses
12.3.1.1        Bare Relativizer Strategy
        In NoG, it appears as though there exist both internally headed and externally
headed RCs (see section 12.3.1.3 below). For internally headed RCs, only the bare                                              405
relativizer strategy is used (/l-/) and the word order must be AVO or VS. When the RC is
externally headed using the bare relativizer strategy, one marks the S/O external head
with an /-á/ suffix on the RC verb and the bound subject pronominal carries an
intransitive tonal pattern (12.62, 12.73). For relativizing on an A argument, the bound
subject pronominal carries an H tone followed by a transitive tonal pattern (12.50 b). If
the O argument of the RC precedes the verb of the RC (or is not overt), the verb is
marked with an /-a/ suffix (12.51). All known externally headed RCs using the bare
relativizer are postnominal.
       For headless RCs using the bare relativizer strategy and relativizing on an O, the
RC verb carries intransitive tone on the bound subject pronominal. If the A argument of
the headless RC (relativizing on O) precedes the verb, an /-á/ suffix is added to the verb
(12.74). Lastly, using the /l-/ relativizer strategy, it is not possible to have a headless RC
which relativizes on an S argument if the S argument functions as an argument of a non-
copular matrix clause (12.68). These various constructions involving the bare relativizer
/l-/ in NoG are summarized with example numbers in Table 12.5.","[434, 435]"

‘once’, twice’, etc), which are NPs that function as adverbials. These are derived by
compounding a class term morpheme/body part term with a numeral. In order to express
‘once’, one combines the numeral ‘one’ with the grammaticalized body part term for
‘head’ (which follows the numeral) (5.14). In order to express ‘two times’ (or higher),
one uses the body part term for ‘belly’ as the first element of the ‘compound’ with the
numeral following (5.15). 3 This newly derived multiplicative numeral can be used with
or without the word ooká ‘time’ in SoG. One can also use ‘belly’ to derive the meaning
‘once’ in SoG.","[162, 163]"

5.1.3 Constituent Order of the NP
5.1.3.1 “Canonical” Order
         As stated above, the NP in Gumuz tends to be left-headed. Nominal heads are
either independent nouns with a single root/stem or NN compounds/collocations. In
(5.28) the independent nouns for ‘warthog’ and ‘book’ are the first element and syntactic
heads of the noun phrase, just as the compound ‘goat meat’ is the first element and
syntactic head of the noun phrase in (5.29).

           ‘We will divide up that goat meat for you.’         However, in NoG, if a quantifier is used, the quantifier tends to be the first
element of the NP. In (5.30), dogoná gááfa ‘beautiful women’ functions as a compound
head noun in the Attributive Construction with the numeral preceding it. A similar
utterance in SoG has the quantifier following the head noun (5.31) similar to the NP in
(5.3).","[166, 167]"

across the border in southeastern Sudan. This study compares the phonology and
selected aspects of the grammar of two major dialects within the Gumuz cluster:
Northern Gumuz (NoG) and Southern Gumuz (SoG), both of which are spoken in the
Benishangul-Gumuz Region of western Ethiopia. Analysis is based on twenty months of
fieldwork in Ethiopia conducted from September of 2007 through April of 2009.
Language data was gathered from thirty-three native speakers of Gumuz: fourteen from
NoG and nineteen from SoG. The Gumuz language consultants provided a total of sixty-
eight texts of varying lengths and multiple genres, thirty-four texts from NoG and thirty-
four texts from SoG. In addition, a list of approximately two thousand words was
collected from each dialect as well as countless hours of elicited language data. To aid in
further comparison, I worked with two additional Gumuz language consultants from
Yaso wereda 1 eliciting several hours of language data and one text. To date, this is the
first description of Gumuz which analyzes and compares the grammar and phonology of
the two main dialects - that of the north and that of the south. In addition, this description
includes the first tonal analysis of any Gumuz dialect.
         This first chapter gives an overview of the Gumuz language, where it is spoken, a
description of the dialect cluster, Gumuz culture, history, and migrations. It also includes
a review of previous descriptions of the Gumuz language and the various attempts to
classify it. Chapter II provides a description of the phonological inventories of NoG and
SoG, phonological rules, and a discussion of tonal contrasts as well as tonal downstep
and related rules. Chapter III covers the basic shape and phonology of simple noun words

 A wereda is a political division roughly equivalent to a county in the United States. Ethiopian regions are
divided into zones, which are further divided into weredas. A wereda, in turn, is divided into smaller units
called k’ebeles.","[10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"

9.32) and the ‘eye’ of the bow is the arrow (9.8).
        Example (9.181) demonstrates how the verbal classifiers /-(V)ts/ ‘body’ and /-
(V)k ʼw/ ‘head’ classify different parts of the mango tree. The O argument ‘mango’ is
shared by both the verbs ‘climb’ and ‘put’ (9.181). As the word mángóá in Gumuz refers
to both the tree and the fruit, it is necessary for the speaker to classify ‘mango’ in order to
indicate whether s/he is referring to the tree or the fruit.","[347, 348]"

         In terms of syntactic cohesion, one would expect syntactic phrases to be separable,
whereas compounds should be inseparable (Haspelmath 2002: 158). The Genitive
Construction in Gumuz, for example, is a prototypical example of a phrasal construction
as it involves a distinct noun phrase from the noun being modified. In the Associative
Construction, the head noun of the compound is marked by tone (H tone, in certain
constructs); whereas in the Genitive, the dependent noun is marked with the prefix
/(a)lá-/ . The former is considered a ‘construct form’ (typical of some East African
languages) and the latter, a ‘case’ form (Welmers 173ː285, Creissel 2009: 74,76). 2 In
Gumuz, within the Genitive Construction, the genitive noun can either precede or follow
the head noun (in NoG) (6.6), whereas the head-modifier order is fixed in the Associative
Construction. Thus, in terms of separability, the Associative Construction is more
compound-like than, say, the Genitive Construction.","[184, 185]"

        I hypothesize that there are both internally headed and externally headed
constructions in NoG based on two distinct constructions in which RCs are found. The
relativized verb in the first RC construction is identical to that of main clause verbs (save
tonal melody when relativizing on an A). In the second RC construction, the relativized
verb carries distinct tonal melodies for relativizing on A and O arguments from that of
main clause verbs. But more notable is an additional /-a/ suffix on the RC verb which
carries H tone when relativizing on an S/O argument and L tone when relativizing on an
A argument. I consider the first RC construction to be internally-headed. The second
construction is externally-headed with a final verb suffix cross-referencing an external
lexical head. Internally-headed RCs only use the bare relativizer strategy and follow a
rigid word order: AVO for relativizing on A, VS for relativizing on S, and VO for
relativizing on O. RCs can be “externally-headed” whether the lexical head occurs
within the same NP as the RC (12.59, 12.60) or the lexical head occurs as the predicate
nominal of a copular clause with a “headless” RC (12.51). For both clause types, the /-a/
suffix (whether H tone or L tone) of the RC verb indicates that the lexical head is external
to the RC.
        With the relative pronoun plus relativizer strategy, the order of RC and lexical
head is fixed: the RC is prenominal. This strategy differs from the bare relativizer
strategy in that the /-á/ suffix for O argument heads is marked on the verb of the RC even
though the O argument follows the verb. Here, the verb of the RC is structurally identical
to the verb of the bare relativizer strategy in which the S/O precedes the RC. I believe
this is due to the fact that with the relative pronoun plus relativizer strategy, the lexical
head is external to the RC. However, further evidence is needed in order to substantiate
this hypothesis. In any case, for what I have labeled externally-headed RCs (for either
RC strategy), the following can be observed. If the lexical head of the RC is co-
referential with an S argument of the RC verb and no argument overtly follows the verb
of the RC, then an /-á/ suffix is marked on the verb of the RC. If a lexical head is co-
referential with an O argument of the RC verb, then an /-á/ suffix occurs on the verb
(regardless of whether an overt argument follows the verb). If the lexical head is not co-                                              408
referential with an S/O argument (i.e. is an A argument) and no overt argument of the RC
verb (neither A nor O) follows the verb, then an /-a/ suffix occurs on the verb of the RC.","[436, 437, 438]"

                 ‘The one who hit the chair is Bamita.’        Example (12.52) also demonstrates the HL tonal pattern on the bound subject
pronominal. The final /-a/ suffix on the verb of the RC is not necessary as the O
argument of the RC verb follows it. The final /-a/ and the addition of H tone on the verb
of the RC allow for case recoverability while allowing for variable word orders.     (12.52)     l-á-gááχ             gááχá obá-ma=tso

                 ‘The one who did work is my father.’        In (12.53), the verb stem contains an IN/CL. In such instances, the IN/CL is
expressed with its underlying tone. In (12.53), the underlying tone of /-kʼwá/ is H tone
and the final /-a/ suffix with L tone is not added.14 The tone of the bound subject
pronominal is H followed by a transitive tonal melody; in (12.53), the 3SG subject
pronominal is therefore realized with a HL tonal melody.     (12.53)     dua l-â-fag-ákʼwá                 óó-bámítá
                 child REL-3SG:A.REL-grow-HEAD M-Bamita
                 ‘The one who raised the child is Bamita.’        One difference between the relative pronoun plus relativizer strategy and the bare
relativizer strategy is that with the pronominal strategy, the final /-a/ suffix (for externally
headed RCs relativizing on an A) is not added when the O argument of the RC precedes
the verb. However, this final /-a/ shows up on headless RCs that lack on overt O
argument (12.57). Like the RCs with a bare relativizer, the pronominal RC can either
have a lexical head (12.54) or be headless (12.55, 12.56). When there exists an overt
lexical head, the pronominal RC occurs before the head.","[438, 439]"

1.4.3.4. Ahland et al. (2002)
           In an attempt to conduct a more comprehensive study of intelligibility, Michael
Ahland, Linda Jordan and I conducted a study of the Gumuz language as spoken in eight
Gumuz locations, both to the north and south of the Blue Nile (2002). In this report, the
Gumuz locations are referred to by the following wereda names (except for Dibat’e
wereda which is divided into north and south): Guba, Mandura, North Dibat’e, South
Dibat’e, Wenbera, Sirba Abay, Agelo Meti, Yaso, and Metemma. Additional
investigation was carried out in the Yarenja Refugee Camp in an attempt to compare the
Gumuz language of Sudan with that of Ethiopia. The study also involved sociolinguistic
questionnaires about language and culture. Word lists of approximately 320 items were
also gathered in eight of the weredas along with a few grammatical paradigms.
           The goal of Ahland (2002) was to assess the level of comprehension across the
various Gumuz locations in order to make practical recommendations for language
development work in Gumuz. The study found the following varieties would group
together under Agelo Meti as a communication center: Guba, North Dibat’e, Wembera,
the Sudanese of the Yarenja Refugee Camp, Metemma, and Yaso. The one variety that
would not be part of the Agelo Meti communication center would be Mandura (2002:1).",[50]

the object of the dative/benfactive to occur simultaneously on the verb. In (7.120), the

        For transitive verbs (in NoG), if the dative is marked on the verb simultaneously
with the object and subject, the dative follows the pronominal marking in both the
nonfuture and future tenses (7.122-7.123). 21
21
  The intransitive verb forms from (7.120, 7.121) were from a different consultant than the transitive verb
forms in (7.122, 7.123). Both consultants are from the Mandura area but the differences could be due to
dialect nonetheless. The incorporated dative with object form is yet again slightly different in Innocenti’s
Grammar of Mandura, where the incorporated dative is repeated at the end of the future tense verb: d-e-ç-
ər-açə-kə-ka AFF-FUT-give-1SG-2PL-DAT-DAT (parsing is my own) ‘I will give to you all’ (2010: 89). This
repeated dative is also found in verbal stems comprised of a verb root and an incorporated noun in which
the incorporated noun is found word-finally and not contiguous with the root verifying that the two dative
morphemes are indeed part of the verb: e-çʼək-ər-açə-kə-ka-s? FUT-release-1SG-2PL-DAT-DAT-MOUTH
(parsing my own) ‘Shall I release for you?’ Innocenti provides another variation of this same verb in which
the two incorporated datives exhibit yet another order: e-cʼəkʼ-ər-k-acə-ka-s? (2010: 90).","[252, 253]"

11.1.2.2.      Object Complements Formed with the ma- Construction and an Argument
               Coded as a Possessor       In NoG, an intransitive complement of ‘say, tell’ can be formed with the ma-
construction plus a possessive suffix on the nominalization referencing the erstwhile S
argument of the nominalized verb. If a 3SG subject of the complement clause refers to a
different referent than the 3SG subject of the matrix verb, an additional 3SG pronoun (or
full NP) marked with the genitive prefix is optionally added before the nominalized verb
(11.27).

        In SoG, the same structure is used under similar circumstances. When the clausal
complement of ‘want’ is a nominalized dynamic intransitive and has a different subject
from the matrix clause, the erstwhile S argument of the nominalized verb is encoded by a
possessive suffix (11.28).","[393, 394]"

                    ‘Take a piece of the wood from the fire.’           In a similar fashion, if the verbal classifier /-(V)k ʼw / ‘head’ is used in conjunction
with a compound that has kʼwá- ‘head’, a singulative meaning is conveyed. This is true
for both NoG and Yaso Gumuz. In NoG ‘tire (N)’ can be stated with or without the kʼwá-
‘head’ class morpheme. When the class morpheme is present, it seems to emphasize that
the action is done to a single tire (9.139). I have suggested that kʼwá- ‘head’ appears to
be lexicalized as part of an old compound for ‘finger’; but it still seems to be interpreted
as singular when unmodified. In order to express the plural ‘fingers’, the word diida
‘children’ is added before the compound (9.143).39 In Yaso Gumuz, on the other hand,
the word for ‘finger’ is kʼwé-ʔéla (head-hand/arm). In this compound, kʼwá- ‘head’ is not
a hypernym of the dependent noun ‘hand’ and thus could not be functioning as a
singulative. Rather it functions as part of a NN compound with ‘N of N’ semantics (i.e.
‘head of hand’). When used in combination with the verbal classifier /-(V)k ʼw / ‘head’, a
singular meaning for the O argument is conveyed (9.144).",[337]

2.2    Vowels
        Most previous analyses of Gumuz posit a five-vowel system with length
distinctions (Bender 1979:40; Aster 1983, 1991; Uzar 1989, 1997). Irwin (1966),
however, posited six phonemic vowels, including the schwa . 12 Innocenti (2010:17) also
includes the schwa but only for orthographic reasons, in order to promote the correct
pronunciation of Gumuz words, a convention which Uzar (1997:2) had also adopted
when using Latin script. Like these previous analyses (save Irwin’s), I have found that
both varieties of Gumuz (NoG and SoG) exhibit a five vowel system with length
distinctions and that the [ə] is indeed an allophone of /a/ as proposed by Uzar (1989:361).",[76]

"
2.1.1.3.5 Metathesis
        Speakers of NoG at times utilize metathesis in order to break up unallowable
consonant sequences and to preserve preferred syllable structures. For example, the word
íílá ‘belly’ is often compounded with other nouns to form NN constructions referring to                                                  42
the inside or inner part of the second noun of the compound (i.e. it can act as a relator
noun or have a part-whole relationship, see Chapter V). For example, ‘floor’ is the
combination of the nouns íílá ‘belly’ and mátsʼá ‘house’. As the final -a merely marks a
lexical item as a noun (see Chapter IV), this marker is not always maintained in the first
noun of the compound. Thus, ‘floor’ is ííl + mátsʼá. However, a lateral followed by a
nasal or any other consonant is rare and dispreferred in NoG and so also is the VC
syllable type. To avoid the dispreferred phonotactics, the sounds of the first syllable are
metathesized when the compound is formed (2.6).
   (2.6)   a. líí- mátsʼá               ‘floor’
              belly-house            b. líí-tʃagwa               ‘sole (of foot)’
               belly-foot
       Metathesis may also explain vowel rounding before a labialized velar (instead of
an assimilation or rounding harmony analysis). Because short round vowels are
dispreferred word-finally, it may be that the sounds in the final syllable are metathesized
for phonotactic reasons. However, metathesis would not explain why the previous vowel
is still rounded (or partially assimilated to the rounding of the following vowel) as in
example (2.2b) when a short round vowel is not in word-final position (i.e. when the
/-má/ suffix is added).","[71, 72]"

with /a/, there is a measurable length difference even though the vowel quality remains [a]

sometimes use change in vowel quality instead of length in order to indicate contrast
between the two vowels. Consider the minimal pair below and the corresponding vowel
lengths of the final syllables. In both words, the final vowel is roughly double the length
of the preceding vowel. Even though the lengths of the two final vowels appear to be
equivalent, the final vowel of ‘s/he is generous’ is [a] while the final vowel of ‘s/he is
engaged’ is [ə].","[80, 81]"

2.1.1.3.1 Final Devoicing
         In accordance with the findings of Uzar in the Southern Gumuz variety of “Sese”
(SoG) (1989), I have found that Northern Gumuz (Mandura) stops devoice word-finally.
For example words like kób ‘be proud’, bid ‘heal’, atíiɟ ‘order’, and fag ‘grow’ are
pronounced [kóp], [bit], [atíic] and [fək], respectively. This is found in contrast to words
such as dáp [dáp] ‘it sprouted’, bit ‘descend’[bit] getác ‘coil (rope)’ and gák ‘push’ [gə́k]
whose final consonant remains voiceless regardless of environment. 9
2.1.1.3.2     Weakening of /ɗ/
         The alveolar implosive ɗ tends to weaken to a flap post-vocalically in NoG.
However, in careful speech, the implosive is often pronounced. This variation between
[ɗ] and [ɾ] had been noted in previous analyses (Bender 1979:40, Uzar 1989:358, Aklilu
2002, Ahland 2004). While the weakening of the implosive can be observed in most
lexical items that have an original implosive historically, such as wíɗ [wíɾ] ~ [wíɗ] ‘see’ ,
fáɗ [fə́ɾ] ~ [fə́ɗ] ‘rise’, the /ɗ/ is not often realized for certain other lexical items such as
áɗa (1SG) which is most often [áɾa], even in careful speech. Surprisingly, the original /ɗ/
is more often realized when the 1SG morpheme functions as a bound pronominal.
Innocenti also observed this variation with the 1SG pronoun in the Mandura area (2010:
27). Thus, /ɗ/ is still considered part of the proper phonemic representation of the 1SG
morpheme in NoG, as well as in other lexemes.","[69, 70]"

derivational morphology on nouns. Chapter IV describes both bound and free
pronominals. These include personal pronouns, subject and object pronominals on the
verb, possessive suffixes on nouns, as well as interrogative and relative pronouns.
Chapter V discusses the possible constituents of both noun phrases and prepositional
phrases, the latter of which demonstrates some syntactic properties of a noun phrase.
Chapter VI describes nonfinite nominal modification constructions, which demonstrate
properties of both compounds and phrases. Chapter VII covers the structure of the verb
word, discussing verbal morphology and the relative positions of morphemes on the verb.
The grammars of the two Gumuz dialects , NoG and SoG, are most divergent with regard
to verbal morphology. Thus, the similarities and differences between the two are
discussed in great detail in Chapter VII. Chapter VIII introduces the synchronic process
of noun incorporation in Gumuz, as a prelude to the more grammaticalized (and
lexicalized) historically incorporated nouns/class morphemes to be discussed later in
Chapter IX. Chapter IX describes both the verbal classifiers and class morphemes which
historically arose from body part terms in Gumuz. The resultant noun categorizations
that arose from these grammaticalized body part terms (some of which are verbally
incorporated and others of which form part of NN compounds) are described in detail.
Chapter X describes simple clauses found in Gumuz, including copular clauses,
expressions of possession, comparative and superlative constructions, intransitive and
transitive clauses, and possible ditransitives. Case marking alignment is also briefly
discussed. Chapter XI describes the various constructions in Gumuz in which verbs
nominalized with /ma-/ are utilized. These constructions include complements,
subordinate clauses, progressive aspect, and the negative jussive/imperative forms.
Chapter XII covers the various clausal constructions ranging from participant
nominalizations to fully finite relative clause constructions. Lastly, Chapter XIII
discusses various adverbial clauses including temporal, conditional, concessive,
hypothetical/counterfactual, causal, and purpose clause constructions.","[30, 31]"

       Marking the object (O) on the verb appears to be quite rare in Gumuz. Most verbs
are only marked for A or S arguments (subjects). In fact, all texts in the corpus, save one,
mark verbs with only A or S bound pronominals.
       The marking of both subject and object simultaneously on the verb is found in the
Mandura dialect of NoG and is restricted to certain combinations of A and O
pronominals. Such combinations are discussed in more detail in Chapter VII. The O
bound pronominals that are known to exist are similar in form to the S pronominals.
However, there are no 2SG and 3PL pronominals marking O on the verb. Table 4.9 lists                                            126

11.2.1. Complement of the ‘Go’ Auxiliary
11.2.1.1.         The Fully Inflected ‘Go’ Auxiliary and its Complement
         In both NoG and SoG, the verb ‘go’ has grammaticalized to some degree as an
auxiliary meaning ‘be about to’ or ‘be going to’. In NoG the complement of the ‘go’
auxiliary is structurally similar to the different-subject complements of verbs like ‘want’,
‘think’, and ‘tell’ (section 11.1.2.4) and is also structurally similar to different-subject
purpose clauses (Chapter XIII); the complement takes the form of /ká-/ plus an inflected
form of the ma- construction (11.55, 11.56). However, the ‘go’ auxiliary and its
complement always share the same subject. Also, the ‘go’ auxiliary is marked tonally as
intransitive (regardless of the transitivity of its complement) and thus the ‘go’ plus
complement construction resembles a main verb plus a purpose clause (which is the
likely source of this construction), rather than a transitive matrix verb plus object
complement construction.",[402]

bound subject pronominal /ára-/ 1SG. This appears to be a metathesis peculiar to the language consultant
who provided the clause. The fact that this is a metathesis involving vowels only is clear with the
downstep that is induced on the verb root dá. This downstep would normally arise from the HL pattern of
the bound subject pronominal; the remote past morpheme /é-/ does not bear a L tone which would induce
downstep on the following H tone.

8.2.2 Evidence for Incorporation
       According to Mithun (1986:379), “Noun incorporation is a lexical process
whereby a noun stem and verb stem are compounded to form a derived verb stem” but
once these nouns are incorporated, “they have no syntactic roles as arguments of the
clause.” As AVO word order is quite common in Gumuz and incorporated noun
roots/stems are incorporated following the verb root, it is necessary to demonstrate that
what I have presented as an IN is not an argument of the verb. This is necessary,
especially as the O argument in Gumuz remains unmarked for case (Chapter X), thus
potentially making it difficult to distinguish an IN from an O argument. It must also be
demonstrated that other incorporated elements such as class morphemes do not form part
                                            254
of the O argument.Following are six arguments for incorporation using both phonological
and syntactic evidence.
         Phonological evidence for incorporation in Gumuz is that, in most cases, the
incorporated element is phonologically reduced. This is one indication that the
incorporated element forms a phonological unit with the verb. For example, in (8.12b)
above, the incorporated element kʼóá ‘head’ has been phonologically reduced to -kʼw,
which is unpronounceable in isolation. In addition, Gumuz exhibits anticipatory harmony
(also known as regressive harmony or left spread) in which the vowel previous to the
IN/affix must agree in rounding with the consonant/vowel of the IN/affix; vowel
harmony in Gumuz does not operate across word boundaries. Thus, when kʼóá ‘head’ is
incorporated, an epenthesized /a/ or [ə] is rounded to harmonize with the labialization
(underlying round vowel) on the consonant. The epenthesized central vowel must also
agree in height with the vowel previous to it. As there are only back rounded vowels in
Gumuz, the choice of vowel must be [o] in the case of (8.12b) as it also agrees in height
with schwa. The resulting phonetic realization of (8.12b) is: [déwíɗə́rókʼ]. 11 Additional
phonological evidence is the loss of the final nominal marker /-a/ when the noun is
incorporated. This is true for all body part nouns except ‘hand/arm’ (in Northern Gumuz).
In fact, because nearly all nouns in Gumuz end in /-a/, it could be argued that this final
vowel does not necessarily derive but marks a word as a noun. When incorporated, the
body part morpheme loses its syntactic status as noun and therefore also loses this /-a/
marker. 12
         Further evidence for incorporation comes from syntactic argument structure. In
example (8.16b), if ‘belly’ were counted as a core argument, the verb stem ‘wash’ would
need to be ditransitive with ‘belly’ and ‘house’ as its objects, a semantic unlikelihood
given the overall meaning of the sentence. Moreover, Gumuz verbs cannot normally take11
  Another possible explanation for the phonetic realization is metathesis of the round vowel (labialization)
of k’wá when incorporated into the verb.
12
  For certain finite subordinate clauses, the final /-a/ marker is realized on the IN/CL (see Chapters XII and
XIII).","[283, 284]"

the S argument of verbs containing an IN/CL. Similar to the bare relativizer strategy, the
3SG bound subject pronominal carries H tone (12.65, 12.69, 12.70) instead of L tone
when these involve Middle Voice Constructions; L tone (or a transitive tonal pattern) is
typical of main clause Middle Voice Constructions (Chapter VII). Also similar is that the
IN/CL expresses its underlying tone and no final /-á/ suffix is added. In example (12.69)
the underlying tone of /-cá/ is H and for /-tsa/ (12.70), the underlying tone is L. The final
vowel and respective tone of these IN/CL morphemes are not expressed on the
corresponding main clause verbs.   (12.69)     etá-l-á-n̩-ʃá-á-cá                      mambráátá=tso

               ‘The one who is sick is Bamita.’12.3.1.6       Relativizing on O Arguments
       Both relativization strategies — the bare relativizer and the relative pronoun plus
relativizer — can be used for relativizing on O arguments. Again, with the bare
relativizer /l-/, the RC can be internally headed (12.71, 12.72), have an external lexical
head (12.73), or be headless (12.74). If an overt head exists, the RC is postnominal. If
the O argument lexical head is external to the RC, a final /-á/ suffix is added to the verb
(12.73). In addition, a headless RC coreferent is a predicate nominal, the final /-á/ suffix
is added to the verb (12.74). In these externally headed constructions the bound subject
pronominal on the verb of the RC carries an intransitive tonal pattern (H tone for 3SG
and HL for all other persons). However, if the RC is internally headed, the tonal pattern
on the bound subject pronominal is transitive (12.71, 12.72). This suggests that one can                                             415
only relativize on S/A arguments and not O arguments when the RC is externally headed.
That is, the O argument is made an S argument in order to relativize on it.","[443, 444, 445]"

              ‘Crowǃ’8.2.3.2 Manipulation of Case / External Possession
       One common pattern of noun incorporation cross-linguistically is that of
incorporating a body part noun which results in promotion of the possessor of the body
part to a core argument. This is what Mithun has labeled Type II incorporation
(1984:856). I will refer to this phenomenon with the more general term, external
possession (EP), which does not necessarily imply or require the ‘promotion’ of
arguments. In sum, “EP constructions have an extra participant” in which “the possessor
is treated as an additional argument of the clause” (Payne and Barshi 1999:5). Such
constructions “can... result from the type of noun incorporation that leaves the [possessor]
of an incorporated noun external to the verb as an object or intransitive subject” (Payne
and Barshi 1999:6). Many instances of EP in Gumuz could arguably be considered
“possessor raising”. However, there are certain “rare” constructions (in terms of the
world’s languages) in which the possessor in an EP construction is the subject of a
transitive clause (Payne and Barshi 1999:10), in which case, there appears to be no
“raising” involved. As Gumuz exhibits both the typical possessor “raising” as the result
                                            261
of NI as well as possessors as transitive subjects, external possession (EP) is preferable as
a cover term for these constructions.
          With traditional notions of possessor raising, it is assumed that in addition to the
EP construction there should also be an internal possession construction counterpart. An
internal possession construction is one that expresses possession within the NP. In (8.44),
the internal possession construction ‘the child’s mouth’ is expressed as a NN compound
which functions as the O argument of the verb fwítʃ ‘blow’. With NI, the body part term
‘mouth’ is incorporated into the verb and dua ‘child’ becomes the O argument (8.45).
Hence, the possessor has been “raised” to core argument status.","[290, 291]"

7.2.3.2 Incorporated Locative/Ablative
       The locative/ablative preposition ná is incorporated as a suffix /-(a)n/ in the final
position of the verb in Gumuz. In NoG, its function appears to be limited to indexing a
location, with a few exceptions. In SoG, on the other hand, it has grammaticalized as a
past perfect aspect marker, in addition to its function of marking a location on the verb.
       In (7.134), /-(a)n/ indexes the ablative prepositional phrase ‘from the anteater
house’. However, indexing of locative/ ablative prepositional phrases on the verb is not
obligatory.",[256]

7.2.1.4 Jussive
         In Gumuz, the jussive mood relates to commands for third person subjects and is
marked by the prefix /n-/. This jussive prefix occupies the same position as the
‘affirmative’ prefix and the two prefixes are mutually exclusive. A verb conjugated in
the jussive mood has person marking before the verb root, similar to nonfuture
conjugations (see also Chapter XI) (7.82). 10            SoG

         Both person and number are marked on the verb in Gumuz. This is mainly for S
and A but can also include O in NoG. All bound pronominals vary in tone according to
the valence of the verb stem (see Chapter IV) and indicate person as well as number. The
plurals are interpreted as ‘paucal’ (two to four people) in NoG. In order to indicate a
larger number of participants in NoG, one must use the ‘greater plural’ suffix in addition
to the plural (or singular) form of the bound pronominal. As Chapter IV discusses all the
various forms of the bound pronominals, the following sections focus on simultaneous A
and O marking in NoG (Section 7.2.2.1), the ‘greater plural’ in NoG (Section 7.2.2.2);
and the use of the third person plural form for passive meaning (Section 7.2.2.3).","[239, 240]"
