morphemes under discussion, or where relevant to the discussion. The first Jines

segmental features (e.g. tone units, salience, etc.) are indicated. Bolding indicates
that a syllable is salient.
       (b) Interlinear glosses are unit by unit, each full unit distinguished in the
Gooniyandi line being glossed. Where more than one English word is required
for the gloss of a unit, the words are separated by a colon (:). For typographic
convenience, 'he' is used in the glosses instead of the more cumbersome 'he, she,
or it' (Gooniyandi does not make gender distinctions in its nominals and
pronominals).
      (c) A free translation is given for each example. This is enclosed in quotes:

Gooniyandi 1 is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken by about one hundred
Aborigines in the south.ern Kimberley region of Western Australia. It was
classified in the lexico-statistical surveys of the 1960s as a member of the
Bunuban (Bunaban, in the earlier spelling) language family, a small family
consisting of just two languages, Bunuba being the other member (O'Grady,
Voegelin and Voegelin 1966:28, 35, Wurm 1972:123). This classification
accords with the earlier classification of Capell (1940:244), who grouped
Gooniyandi and Bunuba together, on typological grounds, as ""prefixing
languages without noun classification"". To date, genetic relationships have not
been definitely established with any other language family in Australia (or
elsewhere), Dixon (1980:3) notwithstanding.
      The language shows many characteristics which have come to be regarded
as typical of Australian languages, but is in a number of other respects atypical.
For the initial orientation of the reader, I will mention a selection of these
typical and atypical features. It is not suggested that they represent a significant
typologising of the language.
      Gooniyandi has a phonology which accords with the normal Australian
pattern. It shows six distinctive points of articulation for stops and nasals
(bilabial, apico-alveolar, apico-postalveolar, lamina-dental, lamino-palatal and
dorsa-velar), and three for laterals (apico-alveolar, apico-postalveolar, and
lamina-palatal). There is a retroflex frictionless continuant, an apical tap, and
two semivowels. Three short vowels are distinguished; length is contrastive for1 The language has usually been referred to in the anthropological and linguistic
literature as Gunian; in my earlier writings on the language I used the spelling
Kuniyanti. (For a full list of the variant spellings, see McGregor 1988e.)
However, speakers generally feel the term Gunian to be a shortening (see below
page 72), and prefer that the full form Gooniyandi be used in written reference to
the language and people (Street and Chestnut 1984).
2                                INTRODUCTIONthe low vowel only. There are no sibilants or fricatives, v01cmg is not
distinctive, and stress has a purely delimitative function (Trubetzkoy 1969:27).
Words almost always begin with a consonant, very rarely with a consonant
cluster; the apical distinction is neutralised word initially. Word medially a fairly
large number of two member consonant clusters occur. Non-verbal roots are
nearly all disyllabic or longer and typically end in vowels. Verbal roots are
phonotactically unusual (cf. Dixon 1980: 159): a large number are monosyllabic,
and many end in consonants, occasionally consonant clusters.
       Lexical words may be divided into three main classes or parts-of-speech,
each with a number of subclasses: nominals, verbals, and adverbials. These are
open classes, each with a large number of members. Pronominals constitute a
distinct closed class and distinguish three persons and two numbers. Instead of
the inclusive/exclusive distinction normally found in the first person non-
singular in Australian languages, Gooniyandi makes a restricted/unrestricted
distinction. In this system, the unrestricted pronominal refers to the speaker, the
hearer, and at least one other individual; the restricted pronominal refers either to
the speaker and the hearer, or to the speaker and one or more persons other than
the hearer. In terms of the traditional categories, the unrestricted pronominal
corresponds to first person plural (more than two) inclusive, while the restricted
pronominal corresponds to the first person dual (either inclusive or exclusive) or
the first person plural exclusive.
      Noun classes are not distinguished in Gooniyandi, and nominals do not
inflect for number or case. Instead, number and case information is conveyed by
means of phrase-level enclitics, which are referred to in this book as
postpositions. There are number-marking postpositions distinguishing dual and
plural numbers, and case-marking postpositions conveying ergative, dative,
ablative, allative, locative, and other local meanings. Gooniyandi nominal
phrase marking is not split ergative (Silverstein 1976b, Dixon 1979): any NP
regardless of its person or number may be ergatively marked. The ergative
postposition is, however, optional for all phrase types in the 'transitive subject'
function. Word order in the NP is free in the sense that determiners and
adjectives may precede or follow the nominal they modify. However, the NP
may be described in terms of a fixed sequence of functions or roles that the
constituent words realise.
       The verbal complex has properties characteristic of both phrases and words.
It is phrase-like in its position on the rank scale (Halliday 1961/1976): it is a
clausal constituent whose ""granddaughters"" are items of morpheme rank; it is
word-like in that it is a single distributional unit, the constituents of which
                                 lANGUAGE TYPE                                      3occur in a fixed order. There are two obligatory constituents in the verbal
complex: a verbal stem, which always occurs initially, and a 'classifier
complex'. This classifier complex consists of, in the following order: a tense
marking prefix, bound pronominal prefixes which cross-reference certain actants
in the clause, and a 'classifier'. The tense system distinguishes four tenses (past,
present, irrealis and future); the pronominal prefixes on the whole inflect on a
nominative-accusative pattern, and generally show the same person and number
distinctions as do the free pronominals; and the classifiers distinguish twelve
classes of processes (based on aspectual type and valence, to put it loosely). In
addition the verbal complex may have one or more of a number of optional
constituents which provide aspectual and modal qualification, and a further
system of bound pronominals referring to other ('oblique') actants. Although
these constituents occur in a fixed order, their phonemic shapes, and the
boundaries between them, are frequently obscured by morphophonemic
processes.
      Spatial adverbs, indicating location and direction, are frequent in motion
(and other) clauses: compass directions are used in preference to left-right
orientation, and temporal sequence is expressed by spatial metaphor. There are
also temporal and manner adverbials.
      Modality and other forms of speaker evaluation of a proposition are
encoded in free particles (marking negation, mistaken belief, retribution,
repetition, certainty, uncertainty, and so on} and enclitics (carrying meanings
like 'only', 'again', 'else', 'like', 'etcetera', and so on).
      Two main types of clause, verbal and verbless, are distinguishable,
depending on whether or not there is an inherent (see page 293 below) verbal
complex. Verbal clauses show four (not two- cf. Dixon 1980:278ft) distinct
'transitivity' types: intransitive, transitive, middle and reflexive/reciprocal. These
are defined by the ""case frames"" of the inherent nominal phrase constituents.
Intransitive clauses take a single unmarked NP; transitive clauses have a phrase
which may be ergatively marked and an unmarked phrase; middle clauses have a
phrase which may be ergatively marked together with a dative phrase; and
reflexive/reciprocal clauses have a single phrase, which is optionally ergatively
marked. Verbless clauses are either attributive, identifying, or existential. As in
the majority of Australian languages, constituent order is 'free' (Dixon
1980:441), in the sense that changing it does not affect the referential or
experiential meaning (Halliday 1974:47) of a clause. Constituent order is,
however, significant in respect of the textual organisation of the clause (Halliday
1974:47) - that is, the way in which the clause is organised as a message
 4                                INTRODUCTION bearing unit. In particular, Gooniyandi is a theme-first language.
       Clause complexes consist of paratactically or hypotactically related clauses.
 However, it is impossible to distinguish these two types (or any others) on
 purely formal criteria. There are no morphological markers signalling the
 interclausal relationships, no structural differences between constituent clauses of
 clause complexes and independent clauses, and no necessary cross-clause
 reference relations (see Matthiessen and Thompson forthcoming, and compare
 Dixon 1980:461). The clause complex types have linguistic validity as COVERT
 categories (Wharf 1945/1972: 104). There is, however, a close connection
 between subordination and mood, whereby subordinate clauses always have their
 verb in a marked, non-indicative mood, either subjunctive or factive.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]"
"                     It follows from Figure 5-l that in the above clause types, the inherent
               ERG PP must be paired with a cross-referencing NOM pronominal prefix, and
               the inherent DAT PP must be paired with the oblique pronominal enclitic. In
               intransitive clauses the inherent NP (which has no postposition) is paired with
               the NOM pronominal prefix. However, in transitive clauses it is usually paired
               with the ACC prefix, and very occasionally with an OBL pronominal enclitic.
               (An NP is paired with the NOM prefix in transitive clauses only in those cases
               in which the ERG postposition is omitted - see remark (2) below.) The

Remarks:
(1) The reflexive/reciprocal construction in Gooniyandi is typologically unusual:
in most ergative languages in which the reflexive/reciprocal is verbally encoded
the one obligatory constituent is an unmarked or 'absolutive' one (Edmonson
 1978:646-647). It is normally only in those ergative languages in which it is
                                                                                      'l
not verbally encoded that the inherent constituent is an ergatively marked one.
And in keeping with Edmonson's typology, in the Pama-Nyungan languages to
the south of Gooniyandi, Walmajarri (Hudson 1978:66), Wangkajunga (my
fieldnotes), Nyangumarta (Nash 1980:205), which also have the obligatory
constituent in the ergative, the reflexive/reciprocal is realised by an enclitic
pronominal, and is not a feature of the verb.
(2) Unlike a number of so called ""ergative"" languages, ergative marking in
Gooniyandi occurs on all phrase types, irrespective of person (cf. Dixon 1979).
However it is optional: in each of the clause types marked above as having an
ERG PP, the ERG postposition may be omitted, and the participant role may be
realised by an NP instead. There is however a strong correlation between
inanimacy and the realisation by an ERG PP. An inanimate in the appropriate
                                                                                      ··I                                   Irole is almost invariably realised by an ERG PP.                                       II                   ,

patha (Walsh 1976:405), Motu, etc. (cf. Dixon 1979:71). That this is the case
should be clear from the following observations: In two of the clause types in
which ERG PPs occur, reflexive/reciprocal and middle, it is clear that the ERG is
not needed to distinguish between any roles. Secondly, there are many instances

                                           Furthermore, realisation of this participant role by an ERG PP is much more
                                           frequent in texts than in formally elicited material (where its use is comparatively
                                           rare). A preliminary investigation of half a dozen texts (all narratives in the first
                                           and third persons) showed that the relevant participant role was realised by an
                                           ERG PP in fifty cases, and by an NP in ten cases, in transitive, middle and
                                           reflexive/reciprocal clauses. (The small number of cases is due to the fact that the
                                           participant role was normally ellipsed - see remark (3) below.) In only a handful
                                           of the fifty cases of PP realisation could there have been any reasonable
                                           possibility of ambiguity had an NP occurred instead.
                                                  These facts strongly suggest that the presence of the postposition plays
                                           some role in the text, possibly giving some sort of salience to the constituent to
                                           which it is added, and may have something to do with foregrounding of the whole
                                           clause in which it occurs within the text. It has been suggested by Hopper and
                                           Thompson (1980:294-295) that foregrounding is associated with high
                                            transitivity, backgrounding with low transitivity. It may be reasonable to see the
                                           clausal variants in which realisation by an NP occurs as ""less transitive"" than
                                            those in which realisation by an ERG PP occurs. For the moment, however, this
                                           remains only a possible issue for future research. I think it likely that there are a
                                           number of factors pertinent to the occurrence or not of the postposition. I
                                            propose to ignore this complication in the remainder of the discussion. The
                                            option ERG PP or NP will be assumed to lie outside the system of clausal
                                            transitivity: i.e. the NP and PP will be assumed to be alternate realisations of a
                                            single role.","[302, 303, 304]"

                  Two major aspects of the textual organisation of Gooniyandi utterances are
                  distinguished, following Halliday's suggestions for English. They are: (i)
                  INFORMATION, which is concerned with the given/new opposition; and (ii)
                  1HEMATISATION, which is concerned with the theme/rheme (or topic/comment)
                  opposition (Halliday 1967, 1970, and 1985). Information and thematisation
                  impose distinct and independent structures on utterances. As in Englisht

information structure in Gooniyandi is expressed primarily prosodically, by
intonation features, and the thematic structure is realised through constituent
order. This section is concerned with information; thematisation is discussed in
the following section.
      As has already been remarked, Gooniyandi discourse is highly elliptical. As
a rule, given or retrievable information is ellipsed. There are few restrictions on
either the word/morpheme class of elements that may be ellipsed, or on their
experiential role in the clause. The only exceptions are propositional modifiers
such as mangaddi 'no, not', yiganyi 'uncertain', thaddi 'mistakenly believed';
these particles are never ellipsed. There are, however, some striking differences
in the types of constituent that tend to be ellipsed depending on the generic type
of the text. In narrative texts of the type investigated for the purpose of this
description (see section 1.10), ellipsis of nominal expressions is rife, but verbal
complexes are almost never ellipsed. Expressions referring to the main
participants in a clause are particularly prone to being ellipsed, since they are
cross-referenced by bound pronominals in the verb - cross-referencing often
provides sufficient information about the participant to allow it to be identified.
A count over the fifteen texts investigated revealed that only about one in five
clauses had its full quota of inherent phrases. At the same time there were only
three or four cases in which a verb had been ellipsed; and in each of them, the
ellipsed verb belonged to the second clause of a 'correlative' construction the first
verb of which was lexically identical with it (see example (5-264) below).
      On the other hand, in everyday conversation there is a greater tendency for
given verbal complexes to be ellipsed. (5-205) is a typical conversational
exchange.
     (5-205) A: gardlooni
                I: hit: him
             B: ngoorndooga
                by: someone
             A: nganyingga
                by:me
             A: 1 hit him.'
             B: Who did?' (B was rather deaf)
             A: 1did.'
      Gooniyandi texts are spoken as sequences of TONE UNITS, which carry
distinctive intonation contours. They are delimited in example sentences and the
texts by slashes. Tone units are typically bounded on each side by short pauses.
362                               THE ClAUSENot every pause signifies the end of a tone unit, however. There may be pauses
in which the speaker is collecting his/her thoughts, which are followed by
material identified as being from the same tone unit, on the grounds that pitch is
relatively constant before and after the pause. Occasionally, too, two tone units
will occur in succession, with no intervening pause. For examples of tone units
see the texts in Appendix 1.
      The tone units into which a text is divided typically do not correspond to
grammatical divisions into clauses or sentences. Quite often a single NP is
uttered in isolation, in a tone unit of its own, separate from the other
constituents of the clause to which it belongs. And the remaining constituents,
which need not correspond to any grammatical division of the clause, may fall
into a single tone unit. However, tone units are not distributed randomly across
the clauses of a text. As a rule, a clause consists of an integral number -
usually between one and five - of tone units, each of which contains an
integral number of clausal ICs. Tone units do not normally consist of parts of
two clauses, or parts of two phrases (unless they are discontinuous). Most
frequently, a clause will fall into either one or two tone units as illustrated in
example (5-206). Although maximal division as in (5-207) is possible, it is
rare.
        (5-206) ned colin -ngga I lajangangadda         yawarda I
                             ERG      he:rode:it:for:me horse
                'Ned Colins, he rode my horse for me.'
        (5-207) garndiwiddi   ngidi yoowooloo -yooddoo I barajjiddayi I
                two           we    man        DU        we:followed:it
                thinga I
                foot
                'We two men followed the footprints.'
Rarely, a single tone unit consists of two full clauses.
      This raises the question: If tone units don't correspond to grammatical
units, what do they represent? The answer proposed here is that tone units
represent the INFORMATION UNITS into which the speaker opts to divide his or
her utterance. Precisely this suggestion has been made by Halliday (1970) for
English, and subsequently by Kilham (1977) and Heath (1984) for the (unrelated)
Australian languages Wile Munkan and Nunggubuyu respectively. (See also
Grimes 1975.}
      I am suggesting that tone units delimit information units into which the
speaker packages his message, each tone unit corresponding to a unit of
                THE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE                        363information, the amount of information s/he thinks the hearer can take in at one
time. Thus, Gooniyandi texts consist of sequences of units each of which carries
one ""piece"" or quantum of information. This raises the important but often
ignored question: What is information? Halliday (1985) has suggested that
""information ... is a process of interaction between what is already known or
predictable and what is new or unpredictable"". There are two problems with this
formulation. The first is that information units sometimes relate things which
are both new; the second is that it is not explained what types of things may be
associated together in this way.
      A rather different view of the nature of information is held by writers such
as Fronek (1983), who claim that information can be presented only through
propositional structures, which means that information is a nexus between a
predicate and its arguments. Both Halliday and Fronek agree on one thing: that
information involves some son of nexus. It appears that this nexus may be of
one of the following three types:
      (a) A propositional nexus, that is, the connection between a full predicate
and its arguments, expressed in a clause.
      (b) An association between two entities, or an entity and an attribute.
(5-208) illustrates this:
     (5-208) gamba joomoo laandi          bagiri I ngaddanggaminhingi
             water soak   up              it:lies   from:dreamtime
              gamba/
              water
              'There's a soak up there, one with dreamtime associations.'
In the second information unit of this example, only a part of the nexus finds
linguistic expression; the other part occurs in the preceding unit. This
information COULD have been expressed clausally in a single tone unit - but
there is no reason to believe that the second information unit of this example is
an (elliptical) clause.
      (c) An association between a linguistic constituent or its referent, and a
clausal or phrasal role. For instance, in (5-206), the first information unit
associated the person Ned Collins with the role of Agent, the rider of the horse.
Alternatively, and/or concurrently, the associated role may be the textual one of
theme.
      The rate of injection of information in a text depends mainly on the
speaker's evaluation of how quickly the hearer can take it in - which is
presumably based on considerations of presumed familiarity with the subject
364                               THE CLAUSEmatter, degree of interest in the subject matter, intelligence, etc. - and is
controlled by its division into information units (see Grimes 1975:297). It is
inversely proportional to the number of information units into which the text is
divided. (5-207) shows a very slow rate of information injection; it is much
quicker in (5-209), where the speaker is presenting an affectively loaded part of
the discourse, the point at which he finds a lost man.
      (5-209) nganyi joodoo -nyali wardngi niyi gilbali I
              I        straight REP I:went him I:found:him
              'I went straight up and found him.'
      The rate of information delivery can be slowed right down by dividing a
particular message into two clauses and two information units. The first unit
will state the matter in its starkest terms, and this will be elaborated on in the
following unit. In this way, not only is the rate of information flow controlled,
but each aspect can be made prominent in a 'natural' way - that is, may be
made the unmarked Focus of information (see below) - without overloading
any message unit.
      (5-210) niyaji ralwiddayi I         boonbooloo ralwiddayi I
              this they:two:plucked:it feather             they:two:plucked:it
              They plucked it; they plucked its feathers.'
      When a given clause consists of two or more tone/information units, it is
typically the case that one of the units can be identified as more central or
PRIMARY than the other unit(s), which will be referred to as SECONDARY
unit(s). The primary unit has a more prominent salient syllable, and an
intonation contour characterised by greater pitch movement. On the other hand, a
secondary unit normally has a slight rise in pitch on its final syllable when it
precedes the primary unit, but a low falling pitch contour (i.e. with a low initial
pitch) when it follows the primary. No matter what its position, the primary
unit does not have the slight rise of the type associated with an initial secondary.
I have attempted to show these features in examples (5-211) and (5-212)

                   (These terms are used following Halliday 1970/1976:167 and 1985:113.) In
                   (5-1), ngaddagi thangarndi 'my language' is the Identified, and Gooniyandi the
                   Identifier. It should be noted, however, that the same clause could also be used to
                   identify the language Gooniyandi: had I been a newcomer requesting information
                   about the language, the speaker could have identified it as his language - this
                   would have narrowed down the field of potential referents.
                         As has been mentioned already, the two NPs provide alternate designations
                   of a single entity. Where they differ is in their 'mode' of referring: one NP
                   specifies the form - how the item is to be recognised; the other specifies the
                   function- how the item is valued (cf. Halliday 1985:115). For example~ (5-1)
                   identifies the speaker's language (function) by name (form) thereby indicating
                   how it is to be recognised. Following Halliday (1985:115) I use the terms
                   TOKEN and VALUE respectively~ for the two different modes of referring, form
                   and function. Unlike the functional roles Identifier and Identified, Token and
                   Value are uniquely assigned to the constituents of an Identifying clause. The
                   Token usually corresponds to the nominal constituent which is most lexically
                   specific; the Value corresponds with the nominal constituent which is least
                   lexically specific. In terms of our example above, Gooniyandi is more specific
                   than thangarndi 'language', so Gooniyandi is the Token (form), and thangarndi
                   'language' the Value (function).
                         The NPs in an identifying clause simultaneously realise one of the roles
                   Identifier/Identified, and one of the roles TokenNaloe. The choices are
                   independent, thus giving rise to two distinct types of identifying clause:
                   DECODING identifying clause, in which the Identified is associated with the
                   Value, Identifier with the Token; and ENCODING, in which the Identified is
                   associated with the Token, the Identifier with the Value (Halliday 1968:202).
                   Each of the four feature combinations may occur initially - i.e. each may
                   realise the textual function of Theme (see section 5.3.2). The possibilities are
                   set out below, with examples:

                          The first two orders, in which the Identified is initial, are the most frequent (cf.
                          Kuno and Wongkhomthong 1981:79-80). The reverse order occurs mainly in
                          examples such as the two shown above, in which the Identifier is an indefmite
                          determiner which is being used interrogatively.
                          There is an unmarked association between the role of Identifier and the textual role
                          of New (see Halliday 1967:226, 1985:117, and section 5.3.1 below). However,
                          the association is not perfect (compare Halliday 1967:227). Partly for this reason,
                          and partly because, while an identifying clause need not contain a Given NP, it
                          always contains an Identified, the distinct experiential roles of Identifier and
                          Identified must be set up and distinguished from the textual roles of New and
                          Given.
                                In Gooniyandi, unlike English (see Halliday 1985: 114), there is no need to
                          distinguish a subtype of possessive identifying clauses which identify an item as
                          someone's possession. Clauses corresponding to English possessive identifying
                          clauses are in fact intensive (cf. Fawcett 1987): the two NPs provide alternative
                          designations for a single entity, the possession; they do not relate the entity and
                          its owner by the relationship of possession. Consider for example, clause (5-3),
                          which is elliptical, with the Entity nominal ellipsed from the second NP, being
                          given: ngiddangi 'our' realises the Deictic role in NP 2• Compare what happens

                         Exemplifying clauses differ from intensive clauses in that (i) they have
                   indefinite Identifieds, whereas intensive identifying clauses always have definite
                   Identifieds, and (ii) the order of the roles is ftxed. These grammatical differences
                   might suggest that exemplifying clauses should be treated as a subtype of
                   characterising clauses (see page 299 below). However, there is a crucial
                   difference: if they were characterising clauses the order of roles would be
                   invariably Attribute""Carrier, as against the otherwise predominant
                   Carrier""Attribute order. Furthermore, the way in which these clauses were used
                   in the texts in which they occurred was to give further examples of particular
                   categories. In this sense they are ""identifying"" -they pick out certain items
                   from a larger class of (potential) referents, as do decoding intensive identifying
                   clauses.
                   [3] Naming identifying clauses. I use the term ""naming"" because one of
                   the NPs provides a name for the other. Such clauses always involve the
                   association of Identified and Token, and Identifier and Value. I encountered
                   Clauses of this type a number of times in learning Gooniyandi, especially when
                   my teachers pointed out things to me in picture books or in the environment and
                   named them. Some examples are:
                        (5-10) ngirndaji labawoo jiga
                               this        white      flower
                               'This is a white flower.'
                        (5-11) ngirndaji ngaddagi           marla
                                     this       my          hand
                                     'This is my hand.'
                         It seems certain, however, that naming identifying clauses are not restricted
                   to circumstances of teaching non-speakers the names of objects. They are also
298                               THE CLAUSEused in identifying personal names and relationship tenns to be used between
individuals, as in:
      (5-12) nganyi nyibaddi
             I         [name]
             'I'm Nyibaddi.'
      I distinguish these clauses initially on intuitive-functional grounds. What
they do is establish associations between non-linguistic referent entities and their
linguistic designations. They do not establish associations between alternative
designations for an object, as do intensive identifying clauses, in which both
NPs are (presumed) cognitively significant to the hearer, and so capable of being
understood to refer to something. In other words, the second NP in naming
Identifying clauses, the name, is used as a representative of itself; it has no
""mental referentn (Fawcett 1980:90). However, there is evidence that they are
grammatically distinct in Gooniyandi. The evidence comes from two main
sources. Firstly, the order of the phrases appears to be fixed; the clauses are
always encoding. Secondly, alone among identifying clauses naming clauses
have situation clause agnates, in which there is an inherent Identifier and an
inherent Identified. This agnate clause involves the verballexeme goowaj- 'call
(by) name':
      (5-13) nginyji goowajgingga        ngoombarna
             you        I:call:you       husband
             'I call you husband.'
It should be noted that naming clauses have alternative interpretations as
intensive identifying clauses in which both phrases are used referentially (cf.
Kuno and Wongkhomthong 1981:89). For example, (5-12) might be used to
identify the speaker as the individual whose name is mentioned.","[279, 280, 281, 282]"
"3.7 Postpositions
3.7.1 Preliminary remarks
The postpositions form a small class of non-ranking form units which enter into
constituency with noun phrases, forming postpositional phrases. They are
bound, phrase-level morphemes which typically occur one per phrase, and
attached to any word in the phrase, regardless of its position or role (see section
4.2 below).
      Gooniyandi has fourteen postpositions. These may be divided initially into
two groups, as shown below:
174                              TIIEWORD          Case marking                       Number marking
          -ngga          ERG(ative)          -yooddoo - yiddi    DU(al)
          -yoo- -woo     DAT(ive)            -yarndi             PL(ural)
          -ya            LOC(ative)
          -nhingi        ABL(ative) 1
          -yangga        ABL(ativeh
          -yidda         ALL(ative) 1
          -yayi          ALL(ativeh
          -yayoo         ALL(ative)3
          -yawpo         ALL(ative)4
          -binyi         PER(Iative)
          -ngaddi        COMIT(ative)
          -winyja        DEP(rivative)
      This classification is primarily semantic, although there is at least one
formal correlate: the number markers appear to be distributionally restricted to
nominals, whilst the case markers may also occur on adverbials (see page 140
above). The two members of the second column indicate a property of the
nominal phrase to which they are attached, namely its number- and hence their
label ""number marking"" postpositions. The postpositions in the first column,
on the other hand, do not indicate any property of quality of the referent of the
nominal phrase to which they are attached. Rather, they relate that referent to
something else. I have labeled these as ""case marking"" postpositions because
they express a range of functions that are covered by case-suffixes in many
Australian languages (we will.be returning to this point shortly, and later again
in section 42).
      Most Australian languages have a set of suffixes comparable with those
laid out above for Gooniyandi (see Dixon 1980:293-301, 322-326). Most
grammars, however, classify the suffixes quite differently. It is customary to
distinguish between case suffixes and derivational suffixes. The former are
inflectional, and give rise to different forms of a single word appropriate to
different syntactic environments, while the latter are non-inflectional, and
produce new lexemes from other lexical items to which they are attached (Dixon
1980:293, 323; see also Huddleston 1984:25). In section 4.2 it is shown that
none of the morphemes listed above are inflections; it can also be demonstrated
that none are derivational suffixes.
      Grammars of Australian languages usually treat the comitative, and the
number markers as derivational suffixes (Dixon 1980:324-325). It is easy to
                                POSTPOSIDONS                                  175
show that the number markers are not derivational: they indicate the number of
the whole phrase, not the word to which they are attached (see page 278 below).
The comitative postposition is not a derivational morpheme, since it regularly
attaches to a full NP (as in example (4-80)), and there is no evidence that the
constituent that it attaches to becomes a new lexical item. These same reasons,
show that none of the remaining postpositions are derivational suffixes.
      The comitative, though not the dual and plural markers, do, it is true,
occasionally have derivational uses. But this occasional use stands in contrast
with the productive uses of this morpheme as a case marking postposition (see
section 3.7.2.9 below). It might also be noted on the one hand that the
morphemes which I have classified as stem forming suffixes ALWAYS
functional derivationally, and on the other, that -nhingi ABLlt as well as
possibly -ngga ERG and -binyi PER also on occasions form new lexical items
from the one to which they are attached.
      I refer to the morphemes in the left hand column above as case marking
postpositions because they fulfil functions which are associated with case
inflections in many languages, including many Australian languages - they
indicate the function of the phrase in the unit of which it is a constituent (cf.
Dixon 1980:292). However, this should not obscure the important difference
that in Gooniyandi the case markers do not form inflectional variants of a
lexeme (see section 4.2 for further discussion of this issue).
      One important consequence of this difference is that, unlike most
Australianist grammarians, I do not identify a zero-marked absolutive case,
which contrasts with the ergative. There are a number of reasons for this
descriptive strategy. Firstly, it would imply a postposition which had an
invariant zero form. Whilst it is possible to maintain such a notion, there is
simply no evidence in the language which lends support to it. (To argue this
would be tantamount to arguing that subject NPs in English were in fact
prepositional phrases with a zero preposition.) Indeed, what evidence there is
leads us to reject the idea: to maintain that there were a zero postposition would
imply that the zero marked unit were an exocentric construction; this is in fact
false. Secondly, zero marking does not signal anything in itself, but the absence
of other meanings. Thirdly, no significant semantic or syntactic generalisation
arises under the zero postposition hypothesis.
      All but four of these postpositions show phonologically conditioned
allomorphic alternations, as follows:
(i) -ngga ERG. This postposition is affected by two sandhi rules. One is rule
R9, by which -ngga dissimilates to-ga following a vowel that is preceded by a
176                               1HEWORDnasal-stop sequence (see examples on page 98 above). The other is rule R9,
which inserts an epenthetic /i/ when the root ends with the velar nasal. For
example, gooddanggooddang-ingga (diverbird-ERG) 'by the diverbird'.
(ii) {y} initial postpositions. Nine of the postpositions have an initial f y}. In
accordance with rule R6 of section 2.4.2.3.1, this initial segment hardens to /j/
following non-continuant consonants. Few Gooniyandi nominals end in
consonants, and in most cases the form of the postposition with initial /j/ is
attested only when the nominal is a borrowing from English, or when the
postposition is attached to a verbal root with a final stop or nasal (see below).
Examples illustrating the hardening process are: Jag-joo (Jack-OAT) 'for Jack',
babligaj-jaljanggal-jiddal-jayil-jayoo!-jawoo (pub-LOC/ABJ..dALLtfALLjALL:J
ALL4) 'at/from/to the pub', goorij-jangga (hold-AB~ 'from holding', and Dayib-
jooddoot-jarndi (Dave-DU/PL) 'a pair/group including Dave'.
(iii) -woo DAT. The verb specific allomorph -woo of the dative postposition is
subject to VR6, the effect of which is to harden the initial ( w} to /g/ when
following a non-continuant, as for instance in gaj-goo (cut-DAT) 'for cutting'
and ngarag-goo (make-DAT) 'for making'.
      The -yooddoo- -yiddi allomorphy is not phonologically conditioned. The
choice seems to be a matter of speaker's preference: some speakers use the
former, while others prefer the latter. (Today at least, the two forms do not
appear to be dialectal variants associated with distinct regions.)
      In addition to occurring in constituency with NPs, some postpositions also
occur in constituency with PPs, adverbials and/or non-finite clauses. The first
possibility gives rise to sequences of postpositions, since the postpositions
from each PP are typically attached to the same d-word. Only a small subset of
the sequences that COULD occur actually DO occur. The first member of any
postposition sequence must be one of -nhingi ABLI> -ngaddi COMIT, -binyi
PER, -yooddoo DU, or -yarndi PL. Of these, the number markers -yooddoo DU
and -yarndi PL can be follow~ by any other postposition (note also that they are
always flrst in a postposition sequence). The remaining three, the case markers,
may be followed by the ergative -ngga only.
Postposition sequences may also arise when a PP is embedded as a constituent of
an NP which is itself embedded in a PP. No new sequences arise in this way.
      The ergative, locative, both ablative, and all allative postpositions at least
are attested in construction with adverbials. It is not clear whether the remaining
case marking postpositions may not occur with adverbials; but it is fairly certain
                                POSTPOSIDONS                                 177that the observed absence of number markers with adverbials is not just an
accidental gap in the corpus.
      At least six postpositions occur in syntagms with non-finite clauses (see
sections 4.2 and 5.5), in which constructions they are invariably attached to the
verbal stem, that is, to the non-finite verb phrase of the non-finite clause. The
postpositions occurring in this context are: -ngga ERG, -ya LOC, -nhingi
ABL 1, -yangga ABL2 , and -ngaddi COMIT. Where the dative -yoo is expected,
instead the form -woo is found. And since -woo occurs in complementary
distribution with -yoo it is taken to be an allomorph of the DAT which occurs
only on verbal stems.","[158, 159, 160, 161, 162]"
"5.6.2.2.4 Concluding remarks
We have seen that as a rule the elaborating clause and the subclausal constituent
it modifies (in case it is not ellipsed) are as a rule immediately next to one
another. They might be regarded as juxtaposed; however, the two do not together
form a unit complex, as is the case in other juxtapositions. The clause either
precedes the constituent it modifies, or follows it. These possibilities appear to
be another reflection of Bolinger's (1967) distinction between referent and
reference modification (discussed above, section 4.1.2.2). As was the case within

the linguistic status of the above relationships, addressing the question as to
                               ClAUSE COMPLEXES                                 445whether the types merely interpretations engendered by the context, and have. no
linguistic significance (cf. Hale 1976:86, and McKay 1988). I will look atthe
tactic relationships frrst, then at the logico-semantic ones.
      In all clause types identified in the table, one clause, the PRIMARY clause;
carries the main burden of the message. The other clause(s) carry less important
information, and will be referred to as SECONDARY clauses. Parataxis and
hypotaxis may be distinguished in terms of the order relationships that may
obtain between the primary and secondary clauses.
      In clause complexes of the types listed in the frrst column of Table 5-2,
the primary clause is the one which comes frrsl In enhancement, the enhancing
clause, which always comes second, expresses a situation secondary to the
situation enhanced upon. (Where the situations are temporally successive, the
most important one is the one occurring frrst: in general, the occurrence of the
second is dependent on the occurrence of the frrst. Furthermore, I would argue
that the fact that the clauses are conjoined indicates that the speaker does evaluate
the event frrst to occur as the most important; otherwise, s/he could have chosen
to use two isolated clause-sentences.) In the case of addition, as in English, the
first clause expresses the situation that the speaker evaluates as the most
important: in (5-366) the most important part of the message concerns getting
the hearer to do something. Similar remarks apply to the other relations of in
the parataxis column. At frrst sight it may appear that in identification the
opposite order occurs, i.e. that the secondary precedes the primary clause: here
the identifying clause, which corresponds to relative clauses in languages such as
English, always occurs first. But closer examination of the facts shows that this
type does not in fact contradict the ordering principle. This type typically occurs
in the context in which the identifying clause carries the new infonnation, and
the following clause carries given information. Consider for example (5-223)
above, in which the final clause of B's response is information given in A's
question.
      It is clear that in clause complexes of the types listed in the second column
of Table 5-2, the primary clause is always the one in unmarked (or indicative)
mood; the secondary clause is always the one in a marked non-indicative mood.
Here clause order has nothing to do with the primary/secondary opposition;
where reversal of the order of the clauses is possible, it does not change the
status of the clauses as primary or secondary. This suggests the inherent
secondary status of clauses in non-indicative moods in these types of clause
complex. The clauses are of unequal status. On the other hand, the fact that
reversal of clauses in complexes from the first column of the table induces a
446                               THE ClAUSEchange in the relative status of the clauses indicates their equal footing. This
justifies the distinction between parataxis and hypotaxis.
       Turning now to the logical relationships, we fmd that in hypotactic clause
complexes the enhancing relationship of location may be distinguished from the
others by virtue of the fact that the order of clauses is fixed in the former, but
not in the latter relationships. In location, the subordinate clause always follows
 the main clause; in the other hypotactic types, the subordinate clause more often
 than not precedes the main clause. Condition is morphologically distinct from
identification and time, except in the future tense, where both condition and time
are realised by a subjunctive clause (I will return to this shortly). Identification
and time can be distinguished as follows: if there is, initial in the main clause,
an endophoric word referring to (and/or summarising) the subordinate clause, it
 must be a determiner in identification, and the adverbial miga 'thus, in thus
 manner' in time. In other words, identification and time are sometimes formally
 distinct, and are in principle distinguishable. Similarly, it should be possible to
 distinguish future temporals from future conditionals by the endophoric element
 that may occur initially in the main clause. And it seems that only temporals
 allow the adverbial miga 'thus, in thus manner'. The discussion of this paragraph
 shows that the logical types in hypotaxis identified in the previous section have
 linguistic validity as covert categories: they are distinguishable by agnation, and
 not by form alone.
        Things are not so clear for the various types of paratactic complexes, and it
  is beyond the scope of this book to determine whether each of the logical types
  identified above are linguistically significant. I will merely remark on the
  statuses of constituent descriptives, constituent identification, and clausal
  temporal inclusion. Identification stands out from the other paratactic
  relationships by virtue of the fact that one of the endophoric determiners may
  come initially in the secondary clause, and refer to the thing identified by the
  primary clause. It would seem that constituent descriptives and clauses related by
  temporal inclusion overlap, but do not coincide: clause complexes admitting the
  latter interpretation admit the former only if the clauses share a nominal
 constituent. Furthermore, neither of these two types appears to display a
 linguistic property distinguishing them from clausal addition.
        But constituent identification in parataxis stands out from the remaining
 paratactic relations in other ways. Identification is the only logical relationship
 common to both parataxis and hypotaxis. Indeed, paratactic identification may be
 grouped together with hypotactic identification, conditionals, and temporals, in
 terms of textual structure. In each of these the expanding clause typically comes
                              CLAUSE COMPLEXES                                 447first, and would appear to function as a type of thematic clause in the complex,
establishing a thing involved in, a place at which, a time when, or a condition
under which the situation referred to by the primary clause did or may occur. The
thing established may be referred to by an initial endophoric element in the
following, main clause. This makes the construction reminiscent of the thematic
option of reprise (cf. above page 375, and Grimes 1975). As we have seen, such
initial subordinate clauses always occur on their own, typically fall-rise;
intonation contour. This may be compared with the rising tone on reprised non-
clausal themes (page 374 above).
       For each of the types identified in the preceding paragraph, final position
for the expanding clause is far less frequent, and this clause may reasonably be
regarded as a type of afterthought, added to clarify an omitted (or ellipsed) theme;
the tone typically falls throughout, and is usually lower than the tone of the
primary clause. Thus, as suggested above, the two types of constituent
elaboration, characterisation and clarification, are merely thematic variants of
identification. The subordinate types are typically added when the theme is
something which has gone before, or is a presupposition, but which the speaker
ascertains the hearer may have difficulty in identifying; the paratactic type adds
new information of a peripheral nature. The four types, paratactic constituent
elaboration, hypotactic constituent elaboration, hypotactic conditionals, and
hypotactic temporals, may be grouped together and distinguished from the
remaining types by virtue of their possession of a theme-rheme structure. They
are thus in a sense more tightly structured, and more clause-like than the other
types.
       It is now clear that a number of the types distinguished in the above
discussion do in fact have linguistic significance. This was shown by (1) formal
differences in the choice of moods and resuming determiners; (2) differences in
the significance of clause order; and (3) the fact that the class of complex
sentences allowing a particular interpretation differs from the class allowing
another interpretation. It remains true that many particular clause complex
tokens are multiply ambiguous. Presumably the interpretations are influenced by
the context of the text and the speech situation in which the particular complex
occurs. To take one example, (5-430) occurred in a context in which my
collaborator and I were discussing the previous work on the Gooniyandi
language. No previous mention had been made of this particular white person.
     (5-430) ngamoo gardiya      -ngga thangarndi yoodjingi
             before white:person ERG word         he:put:it
448                               THE CLAUSE              mirlimirli -ya    nangbani
              IJiper      LOC he:died
              'Before a whiteman put some (Gooniyandi) words on paper, but he
                  died.'
              The whiteman who put (Gooniyandi) words on paper before died.'
              'Nthe whiteman put (Gooniyandi) words on paper and died.'
In this context, the first two interpretations are the most likely. Since the white
person had not yet been mentioned, the speaker might have intended that the frrst
clause establish such an individual, and mention as a further observation that
this man had died (in fact, the speaker was wrong here). Alternatively, he may
not have intended that the person be established in this way, but his identity left
indefinite, the point of the utterance being that although someone had previously
worked on the language, this was quite a while ago. If, however, the discourse
had been concerned with the exploits of a particular white person, the third
reading would be the most likely one. Naturally there are formal correlates of the
discourse and speech situation factors, showing up in the order of words in the
constituent clauses, whether or not they are ellipsed, etc. (cf. Merlan
 1981:188ff). We cannot here attempt to identify factors influencing the
interpretations of particular examples.
                                  CHAPTER 6                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICS6.1 Preliminary remarks
 This chapter is a preliminary investigation into the semantics of certain closed
class units, in particular, logical modifiers (section 6.2), enclitics (section 6.3),
particles (section 6.4), and the major categories of the finite verb (section 6.5).
Up to now these morphemes have been given approximate English glosses
only. Other closed class items -             including stem forming suffixes,
postpositions, pronominals, and infinitives- have already been discussed in
Chapter 3 above.
      As in the previous chapters, the object of study is the linguistic sign, a
form-meaning correlation. Meaning, as we have seen (see page 323) must be
distinguished from reference, or the extra-linguistic ""reality"" referred to by a
particular utterance or sign in the utterance. Meaning and reference are not
identical; the former imposes a classification on the latter. On the other hand,
reference must be studied in order that linguistic meaning be determined. What is
different about the investigation of this chapter lies primarily in the nature of the
formal aspect of the sign. In Chapters 4 and 5 the forms were immediate
constituents of phrases and clauses - that is, entities with no unique shape in
terms of either their phonological or their lexical expression, and established by
means of contrast and complementary distribution. It is assumed in this chapter
that morphemes, the ultimate linguistic constituents which have meaning, arc
also signs. In this case, of course, the forms we are concerned with are primarily
(morpho)phonological. The sign is an association between a phonological and/or
a morphophonological form and a meaning. Qualifications must, of course, be
made regarding: (i) homophony, in which two distinct signs share a
phonological form; and (ii) allomorphy, in which a single sign has variant
phonological expressions.
      The fundamental assumption of the approach to meaning adopted here is,
then, that each formal item or morpheme (with the exception of homonyms) has
associated with it a linguistic meaning which remains constant throughout all of
450                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICSits uses. I will refer to this invariant of meaning as the FORMAL meaning of the
morpheme, following Ellis (1966:80). Other linguists have used terms such as
""core meaning"" (McConvell 1983a), ""grammatical meaning"" (King 1983), and
""common denominator of meaning"" or ""Gesamtbedeutung"" (Jak:obson 1936 and
Waugh 1975). This formal meaning must be distinguished from the various
CONTEXTUAL meanings or interpretations that the morpheme acquires in the
various circumstances of its use. Contextual meanings do not form a part of the
essential meaning carried by a form, and they vary according to its linguistic and
extra-linguistic environment. Of course, a given morpheme is always used in
some context, linguistic and extra-linguistic. And each context will engender a
particular semantic interpretation, which must not, however, be confused with
the meaning inherent in the morpheme, and common to all of its uses (cf.
Waugh 1975:439, and King 1983:113). In order to establish the formal meaning
of a morpheme, ALL of its uses must be examined, and from them a common
denominator of meaning extracted (if possible) on which the various uses are
based.
       As King (1983:102) points out, many grammarians have been content to
delineate and catalogue the uses attributable to a particular form. There are,
however, a number of problems and inadequacies with this sort of approach to
semantic description (see King 1983: 103). From the perspective of the present
investigation, the major problem concerns the identification and delimitation of
these meanings. Nothing seems to prevent the proliferation of meanings as more
and more individual examples are taken into account: in this approach all
meanings are accorded equal footing. Furthermore, there is another problem for
the linguist who is not a native speaker of the language in establishing the
intended referential meaning of the utterance (or subpart thereof), and its
connotations. I have already discussed this problem in connection with the field
methodology (see section 1.10). It is clear from that discussion that the pairing
between the initial English prompts and the speaker's responses to them cannot
be regarded as unassailable 'raw' data. Even when the context constrains the
possible interpretations there may still be room for misunderstandings
 (especially in the region of non-experiential meanings, which will take up a
significant part of the discussion of this chapter).
       Thus the crucial problem with the cataloguing approach is that the only
means of cross-checking and assessing the presence (or absence) of a particular
sense is to elicit a native speaker's reaction and explanation. (And I have already
 mentioned practical problems inherent in this methodology, at least in the field
 situation where this research was conducted.) However, in the approach I am
                           PREUMINARY REMARKS                                451advocating here, there is a constant interplay and exchange between the processes
of refining the specification of contextual meanings and encapsulating the formal
meanings. The complete meaning of an utterance or subpart of an utterance can
only be approached by degrees, and this may entail successive modifications to
the interpretation of particular examples, even in some cases the rejection of the
speaker's gloss as inappropriate or inaccurate. Furthermore, examples are not
seen in isolation from other like examples. Rather, by processes of cross-
checking and comparison over as large a corpus as possible, significant
contextual meanings can be identified, and proliferation of meanings/uses
avoided. That is, we are more concerned with types of contextual meaning of a
form than with the instantiated and unrepealable meaning tokens in specific
utterances (cf. Ellis 1966:81).
       But the establishment of formal meaning requires more than a mere
examination of contextual meanings. As a sign, a morpheme enters into
paradigmatic relations with other signs, and it is the system of such relations
that gives it linguistic 'value' (cf. Saussure 1959/1974:lllff). The formal
meaning of a morpheme cannot be fully determined without an appreciation of
the meanings of the other morphemes with which it enters into oppositions.
This means that minimal pairs and the principle of paradigmatic opposition
within fixed frames must be used in establishing formal meanings, in addition to
 the process of abstraction of invariants from contextual meanings. A special case
of this is of importance to the study of a number of the forms dealt with in this
chapter. That is, the contrast between the presence and the absence of the form in
given contexts. Meaning is carried by the absence of a particular sign in a place
 where it may occur, and zero in such contexts may also be regarded as a sign
 belonging to the paradigmatic set including the former morpheme.
       This account sets out to do more than merely assign English glosses to
 Gooniyandi morphemes, which glosses are frequently misleading, and have
 unintended connotations. An attempt is made to give sharp formulations (and
 formalisations) of the formal meanings. This enterprise meets with varying
 degrees of success and depth with the various morphemes discussed. The formal
 meanings have, in a few instances, been described in terms of systems of feature
 oppositions (cf. Waugh 1975, and King 1983). This has been done only for
 morphemes which enter into paradigmatic sets, one member of which is
 obligatorily chosen in all circumstances of a specified type- see sections 6.5.1
 and 6.5.5. Elsewhere, formulae and short descriptions have been used.
452                         TOPICS IN SEMANTICS6.2 Logical modifiers
There are three nominals which provide logical type modification of nominals
functioning in the Entity role, yaabja, yaanya, and wajaddanyi, which may be
given rough English glosses 'some, others', 'other, another'. and 'different',
respectively. These logical modifiers are discussed in order in the following three
subsections.6.2.1 yaabja 'some, others'
Yaabja is a non-specific determiner, which usually translates into English as
'some'. It makes reference to an unspecified set of things of the type indicated by
the Entity nominal. Yaabja may be used partitively, selecting a subset of a
previously identified or delimited set:
      (6-1) yiyili         -ya   garndiwangooddoo yoowooloo yaabja
            [place name) LOC many                    man        some
            ngaddagi ngaboo yaabja ngaddagi mama
            my        father some my             brother
            'There are lots of people at Yiyili; some are my fathers, some are
              my brothers.'
      (6-2) yaabja marla -ya       gidgidnginmi
            some hand LOC they:stuck:in:me
            'Some (of the prickles) stuck in my hand.'
Alternatively this lexical item may be used non-partitively in reference to an
indefinite set of things of the particular type, which do not form a subset of an
established superset.
      (6-3) gardjaalooni      yaabja -ngga gardbiinbiddawoo nganyi -rni
            I:might:hit:him some ERG they:will:belt:me me           SEQ
            'Should I hit her, someone will hit me.'
      (6-4) ngaragbinmi balyadi jimind -ngaddi -ngga yaabja
            they:made:it flat   cement COMIT ERG some
            yoowooloo bijgooddarnoo -woo
            man        they:emerge   DEF
            'They laid cement (around the jail walls) lest someone dig
              themselves out.'
     Yaabja 'some' is unspecified for number, but as the examples above
indicate, when reference is being made to human beings, the cross-referencing
                             LOGICALMODIFJERS                                  453
pronominal in the VP is typically plural (cf. example (6-85) below), whereas it
is usually singular in reference to inanimates. Of course, number may be
specified by means of a co-occurring numeral, as in e.g. yaabja yoowarni
yoowoolaanyi (some one man-other) 'some other man'- that is, an indefinite
single individual of another type of person (e.g. from a different country).
      Gooniyandi has no term (either word or enclitic) explicitly indicating
universal quantification, 'all'. The number word garndiwangooddoo 'many' may
be used in this sense, though it remains ambiguous with 'many' and 'most' (cf.
section 6.3.2 below). The same holds true for yaabja, which can be used
partitively in reference to an arbitrary subset of some superset, as discussed
above. Alternatively it may refer to the complement of a subset, if eid1er: (i) the
membership of that subset is uncertain (and/or immaterial), as is the case in
     (6-5) yoowarni limba        gardhini       yaabja yoowooddwinmi
            one       policeman he:shot:him some dley:ran:away
            'He shot one policeman, the others (die remainder) ran away.'
     (6-6) ngidi    -yamdi -moowa warangjawiddiddi yaabja wardbinggiddi
            we(R) pi         ON       we:will:sit        some you:lot:will:go
            We'll sit here; you others can go.' (Literally: 'We'll sit here, some
               (of us) you will go.')
Here yaabja is glossed 'other(s)' in English. Thus, English explicitly marks the
relation between the two subsets, and their relation to the superset (by means of
the definite determiner the), but leaves the undefined status of the set(s)
unmarked. By contrast, Gooniyandi indicates the undefined status of the sets, and
leaves the set-ilieoretic relations unmarked. See also below pages 455-456.
      Or (ii) the membership of the subset is determined, but the complement
(and consequently die superset) has undetermined and indefinite reference. This is
the case for instance in
     (6-7) yaabja     yoowooloo gadloonbini gindiwa danggoo -ya
            some man              I:left:them upstream [name]     LOC
            'I left some (the remaining) people at Geikie Gorge.'
      To indicate that the situation applies with respect to no entity of the stated
type, the usual mode of expression is by negating a clause with yaabja. Thus:
454                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICS      (6-8) yaabja -ngga yoowooloo mangaddi jagbinmi -ngaddagi.
            some ERG man           not      they:spoke to:me
            'No one spoke to me.'
All of the above set-theoretic relations may apply here, of course (i.e. 'no x at
all', 'no x in a particular set', and 'no x in the complement of a subset').6.2.2 yaanya 'other, another'
Yaanya is a comparative determiner which indicates that the referent of the NP is
a different token of the type referred to by the Entity nominal. It invokes a
comparison of the referent with some other entity of the same type, the standard.
      This standard is frequently an entity already established in the discourse.
For instance, in a text describing fish, the speaker introduced a new type of fish
with the clause
      (6-9) yaanya gawi gooloomangaddi
            other    fish catfish
            'Another fish is the catfish.'
Note also
      (6-10) wayandi ngooddi -ya         ngabnga yaanya booddoo
             fire      that       LOC it:burned other north
             wayandi -nyali ngabnga
             fire       REP it:burned
             'A fire burnt over there, and another one burnt in the north.'
      But the standard need not necessarily be something that is mentioned in the
preceding text. It is worth mentioning the other major possibilities in invoking
'standards', since Gooniyandi shows some differences from English (which
presumably reflect different unmarked choices of speaker's empathy (Kuno
1976:431).
      (a) The standard may be the entity of the given type that is involved in the
present speech situation. For example, reference to earlier or later time is
frequently made by expressions such as yaanya-ya wik (other-LOC week) 'the
other week', or yaanya-ya gamba (other-LOC water) 'the other year'. These
invoke a comparison with the present. Similarly present spatial location,
direction of motion, goal, etc. is a likely choice of standard. Example:
                              LOGICAL MODIFIERS                                 455     (6-11) ngooddoo yaanya yaanya         halma milawa
            that        other other        fork  you:will:see:it
            niyaji boolooboowa
            this     you:will:follow:it
            'That other (road- not the one you are following now); you see
                 the other road, well follow it.'
     (b) An implicit standard is normally the least active thing of the particular
type in the situation. In describing a photograph of two men in a boat, one of
whom was rowing, the speaker said:
     (6-12) yaanya -ngga loowa         garndiwiddi -ngaddi -ngga girili
            other    ERG he:pushes:it two           COMIT ERG tree
            'The other one is rowing.'
(The person seated had not been identified in any way prior to this utterance.)
Another example is
     (6-13) yaanya -ngga yoowooloo balyoowa boorloobaa
             other    ERG man            behind         he:follows:him
             'The other man is following behind.'
Similarly, in descriptions of activities such as putting one leg on the other, etc.,
it is normally the passive member that is chosen as the standard. For example:
     (5-14) gaddawooloo yaanya thadladdi
            leg            other I:put:it;down
            'I put one leg on the other.' (Literally: 'I put the other leg.')
There is a single example only available in which the active member was chosen
as the standard. That example is:

            man         other    LOC leg he:put:it:down he:stands
            'The man is standing with one leg on the other.'
     (c) An implicit standard is usually the 'correct' thing that should be
involved in the action. (Possibility (b) can be seen as a subtype of this, in
which the active member is the inappropriate one.) Example:
      (6-16) yaanya   warawoodoo boorloobbini lVallgaddagbani
             other    road         he:followed:it he:got:lost
             'He followed the wrong road and got lost.'
      (d) Both compared entities may be taken as standards for one another. Thus,
456                         TOPICS IN SEMANfiCScomparative utterances such as

are the norm in Gooniyandi. Unlike English, a specific member is chosen as the
unique standard only when there is some compelling reason to do so. A second
manifestation of this principle is that in 'reflexive/reciprocal' clauses yaanya
'other' can be used like the English 'each other':
      (6-18) yaanya wididi gininybinmarni
             other cloud they:mixed:up:together
             'The two clouds met up together.'

             they:might:take:each:other
             'In a month the two people may marry (i.e. take one another).'
      There is a term yawinhingi in the avoidance style which appears to cover
the senses of both yaabja 'some' and yaanya 'other':
      (6-20) thaddi     ngirndaji -ngga widdwalnginbini yawinhingi -ngga
             mistaken this         ERG he:hit:me             other         ERG

             'I thought this man hit me, but it was really the other man.'6.2.3 wajaddanyi 'different'
Wajaddanyi describes something as differing in some respect from a reference
item with which it is compared. For example,
      (6-21) yoowooloo waddmarla         wajaddanyi
             man          desert:person different
             'The desert people are different.'
(6-22) indicates the respect in which the comparison is made - in the text in
which this occurred, the cat had just been introduced as a 'countryman' of the
                                     ENCUTICS                                     457dog:

              'Cats are different, they're little; dogs are big.'
Similarity is expressed differently, by use of -jangi SEM; there is no nominal
which signifies the notion of likeness.","[427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441]"
"    3.3.1.1 Definite determiners
    Definite determiners are of three types: (1) demonstratives, which point to
    something in the situational context of the utterance; (2) endophors, which refer
144                                   TIIEWORDto entities mentioned in the linguistic context -usually in the preceding text,
but sometimes in the following text; and (3) a non-demonstrative, non-
endophoric determiner which identifies an entity which is, or need be in neither
the linguistic nor the situational context.
[1] Demonstrative determiners distinguish two degrees of distance with respect to
the speaker, proximal and distal:
                         Proximal:        ngirndaji   'this'
                         Distal:          ngooddoo    'that'
Both of these terms are used in reference to places as well as things (although
not, it appears, in reference to times).
      There is a third term, ngirnda, which also refers to an object in the
proximity of the speech situation. But it is not clear precisely how this term
differs in meaning and function from ngirndaji 'this'. In quite a number of
examples ngirnda was used in reference to something closer to the speaker than
to the hearer, particularly when the object was invisible to the hearer. For
example, it was used in reference to an object concealed in the speaker's hand
(which the hearer believed was elsewhere) (see example (6-57)); and in another
instance it occurred in a direct quote in a text, the purpose of which was to draw
the attention of the addressee to a dead body the speaker had found. To the best of
my knowledge, there are no examples in which ngirnda is used in reference to
something relatively closer to the hearer, and/or visible to the hearer and not the
speaker. The functions of the determiner ngirnda require further investigation.
[2] There are two endophoric determiners which are usually used in anaphoric
reference to a previously mentioned entity. They are:
                                    niyaji 'this'
                                    niyi 'that'
(Niyi 'that' is homophonous with the third person singular pronoun, but can be
distinguished from the latter on morphological, as well as functional grounds
(see section 3.6). However, it is often difficult to be certain that a particular
instance of niyi is the determiner or the pronoun.)
      The difference in meaning between these two words is not perfectly clear,
but seems to be roughly as follows. Niyaji is frequently used in reference to
something which was mentioned in the immediately preceding text, often the
immediately previous clause, and which is assumed to be in the forefront of the
hearer's consciousness. It is frequently used in the ""reprise"" construction (see
section 5.3.2), illustrated in example (3-12) below. Niyi, on the other hand,
•
                                         NO:MINALS                                    145    often 'picks up' a referent established earlier in the text, but which has not been
    in the foreground for some time. For example, in a text about Pigeon (the so
    called ""outlaw of the Leopolds"" -see 1.6 above), reference is made to an
    Aboriginal police tracker by the phrase niyi-ngga yoowooloo-ngga Roebourne
    Mick-ngga (that-ERG man-ERG Roebourne Mick-ERG) 'by that man
    Roebourne Mick'. This person, who had been introduced ten clauses earlier, had
    played no significant role in the events described in the eight intermediate
    clauses. (See also line (42) of Text 1.) However niyi is sometimes used in
    reference to an entity fore grounded in a text, or one which may be assumed to be
    in the forefront of the hearer's consciousness. In this case it has an emphatic or
    contrastive effect- see for example (6-30) below, and line (81) of Text 1. The
    difference between the two terms thus seems likely to lie in the relative
    prominence they give to the referent item, rather than in the proximity of the
    anaphor within the text.
          In addition to referring to previously mentioned things, the two determiners
    niyaji 'this' and niyi 'that' are used in making reference to portions of text of size
    larger than phrases - that is, to situations, and not just entities. For instance,
    in
          (3-ll) garingi ngangjayi                  niyaji wila
                 wife    he:might:have:given:him this        OK
                 'Had he given him (his daughter) as a wife, it would have been OK.'
    niyaji 'this' refers to the whole clause garingi ngangjayi 'he might have given
    him a wife'. More accurately, it refers to a FACT (Halliday 1985:227), the
    situation referred to by the clause (see 5.2.1), rather than the actual wording of
    the clause. But the section of text may be larger than a clause. For example,
    niyinhingi (that-ABL) and niyaji-nhingi (this-ABL) are used as sentential
    connectives, with the approximate meaning 'then, after that', where the thing
    referred to is either a single event (referred to by a sentence), or an episode
    (referred to by a larger stretch of text. (fhere appear to be individual preferences,
    some speakers preferring and almost always using niyinhingi 'after that'; others
    prefer niyajinhingi 'after this'.) None of the other definite determiners may be
    used in this way: they always refer to material entities or places.
    [3] The determiner ginharndi, which is normally glossed 'you know' or 'that one,
    you know' by speakers, refers to something which is neither in the immediate
    speech situation, nor mentioned in the surrounding text. It indicates that, in the
    speaker's estimation, the hearer is able to identify the entity being referred to, it
    being known to him or her. The fact that it is explicitly stated as being shared
146                                1HEWORDknowledge is the only clue that is given to the hearer to help him/her identify it.
(I'he neighbouring Jaru language also has a determiner jangu with a very similar
meaning- Tsunoda 1981:63.)
      The two most frequent uses of ginharndi in my corpus are (i) in reference
to individuals with whom both my Gooniyandi teacher and I myself had shared
some experience (e.g. a visit), and (ii) in reference to individuals spoken about in
previous conversations. For example, {3-12) illustrates the first usage:
      (3-12) ngooddoo -ngga NPfginharndi goomboo]NP wardgilayi
             that         ERG you:know woman        she:had:gone
             -ngangi moolooddja -yidda niyaji -ngga barnnginaddi
              with:us Mulunja     ALL this     ERG she:retumed:me
             gaddwaroo
             afternoon
             'The woman who went to Mulurrja with us brought me back
                  yesterday.'
     It should be noted that ginharndi is not a definite article, and has a range of
uses quite distinct from the English article the. Ginharndi marks the referent of
an NP as identifiable, and so definite; but only a small subset of definite NPs
may be so marked. As distinct from the English definite article, ginharndi
indicates a specific characteristic by which the referent may be identified: it must
belong to the register of entities known, but not present in the linguistic or non-
linguistic situation. (Compare Halliday and Hasan 1976:71.)3.3.1.2 Indefinite determiners
There are three indefinite determiners, which indicate that the identity of the
referent of the NP is not known to the speaker. They frequently carry the added
nuance of requesting this information from the hearer: that is, they are often used
with interrogative effect (cf. Dixon 1972:182ff). However, it is clear that this
interrogative sense is not a part of the fonnal meaning of the words (section
6.1), but is engendered or suggested by the context of its occurrence (see also
sections 5.4 and 5.3.1 below). This follows from the fact that there are contexts
of occurrence of these determiners (namely when they occur with the enclitics
-ngaddaya 'also, too' (section 6.3.5) and -widdi 'identity unknown' (section
6.3.6)), which do not admit interrogative interpretations. The three indefinite
determiners are:
•
                                        NOMlNAI.S                                    147
                            ngoorndoo       'someone, who'
                            ngoonyoo        'something, which'
                            jaji            'something, what'
          Ngoorndoo is used only when the unknown entity is believed to be human
    (but see below page 148):
         (3-13) ngoorndoo -ga        dijjingi
                someone    ERG he:broke:it
                'Someone broke it,' or 'Who broke it?'
         The two other indefinite determiners are used when the unknown is
    expected to be non-human. They are sometimes also used when it is expected to
    be human, as in the following example:
         (3-14) ngoonyoo ngaanggi jiginya
                which      your        little
                'Which is your child?'
          N goonyoo is attested in two contexts. (i) It is used when there is a closed
    set of possibilities for the particular 'role'. This was the case for example (3-14),
    in which the hearer was requested to identify her child from within a group of
    children. (ii) The most frequent use of ngoonyoo is, however, as an
    indefinite/interrogative for places. In this use, ngoonyoo occurs (normally) as
    the only word-level constituent in a 'local' postpositional phrase, realising a
    spatial circumstance (see section 5.2.3.1). For example:
         (3-15) ngoonyi -yidda2 wardginggiri
                which     ALL you:go
                'You're going somewhere,' or 'Where are you going?'
         (3-16) ngoonyoo -nhingi wardji
                which      ABL    he:went
                'He came from somewhere.' or 'Where did he come from?'
    It is possible that these two senses of ngoonyoo are related as contextualisations
    of a single formal meaning. However, at present, it is not clear whether this
    involves the notion of place - examples such as (3-14) allow this interpretation
    in that the alternatives to be chosen from are as a rule present in the extra-
    linguistic situation, and may be identified by their location. On the other hand, it
    may involve just the notion of choice from a constrained set of possibilities -
    in the case of (ii), the set of possibilities is constrained by type: they are all    2 Note the change of final /oo/ to /i/ preceding the initial /y/ of the allative
    postposition; this is accounted for by R8 above (section 2.4.1.2.3).
148                                1HEWORDplaces. (Cf. in English there is a preference for 'which place' rather than 'what
place' in examples like the free translations of (3-15) and (3-16).)
      Jaji appears to be the least specific of the indefmite determiners, being used
in all circumstances other than those covered by ngoorndoo 'someone, who' and
ngoonyoo 'something/where, which'. It usually suggests that the unidentified
entity is neither a place nor a person, although it does not explicitly exclude
either of these possibilities. For example,
      (3-17) jaji        -yoo gardbini
             something DAT he:hit:him
             'He hit him for something,' or 'Why did he hit him?'
might elicit a reply such as ngaaddiyoo (stone-DAT) 'for money', or winhi
woongooloo gardbini (nothing fun he:hit:him) 'He hit him just for fun.'
Ngaddanyiyoo (mother-DAT) 'for (his) mother' (i.e. for the sake/benefit of his
mother) is an equally direct reply. (Only the last of these could be used as a
direct response to ngoorndooyoo gardbini (someone-DAT he:hit:him) 'He hit
him for someone' or'Who did he hit him for?'.)3.3.1.3 What-cha-ma-call-it
In contrast with the three indefinites discussed in the preceding subsection,
which may realise any of the three noun phrase roles Deictic, Entity or
Qualifier, the hesitation word ngoorndoongoornoo 'what's it called' or 'what-cha-
ma-call-it' occurs only as Entity (or so it appears on present evidence). It is
always the sole constituent of an NP. In normal conversational speech the form
is usually reduced to /ngoorndoomoo/. Ngoorndoongoornoo is quite
transparently constructed from the ""personal"" indefinite ngoorndoo 'who' (which
is also occasionally itself used as a hesitation word, usually in reference to a
person). There are no forms based on the other indefinite words, and
ngoorndoongoornoo serves as a hesitation word for all types of entities, human
and non-human (including places). These facts suggest that ngoorndoo indicates
an indefinite name or designation rather than an indefinite person. Examples are
line (33) of Text 1 and:
      (3-18) ngoorndoongoornoo mirigan      gardiya
             what-cha-ma-call-it American white:person
             'What-cha-ma-call-it? Americans.'

    Ngoorndoongoornoo 'what-cha-ma-call-it' does not occur particularly frequently in
    texts. [a:] is preferred as a hesitation marker. Some speakers use yaa as well as
    ngoorndoongoornoo, with apparently the same meaning.","[128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134]"
"3. 7.2 Functions of the postpositions
The major meanings and functions of each postposition are set out in the
remainder of this section. No attempt is made to separate those uses which
correspond to significant functions within the language (such as Agent, Means,
Manner, etc.) from those which are identified merely on intuitive grounds, and
correspond to no systematic distinction made in the language (such as the
possessor relationship). Although it is my belief that ultimately the
meanings/functions of each postposition will be accountable for as
contextualisations of a single core or formal meaning (see section 6.1), the task
of specifying these formal meanings is beyond the scope of the present analysis,
and I do not attempt it here. In order to reduce repetition, the information is
given in abbreviated form, making reference to discussion and examples from
later sections.3.7.2.1 -ngga ERGative
This postposition marks clausal constituents in the following roles:
      (a) the Agent, regardless of its person or number, in a clause of 'directed
action' - i.e. a transitive, middle or reflexive/reciprocal clause (see section
5.2.1.3 and examples therein).
      (b) the Instrument in all clause types (section 5.2.2.3), regardless of
whether it is a body part or non-body part Instrument. (However, it should be
noted that body part Instruments are far more frequent than non-body part
Instruments - non-body parts are more often Means than Instruments; see page
343 below.)
I reject the view proposed in many grammars of Australian languages that the
instrumental as a distinct CASE from the ergative (see for instance, Tsunoda
178                                'IHEWORD1981:5 5, Dixon 1980:306-307, and cf. Dixon 1980:299). In my view, the
evidence they cite demonstrates that there are two distinct clausal roles, Agent and
Instrument, NOT that there are distinct cases. Thus I do not distinguish, as do
many Australianist linguists, between syntactic and semantic, or core and
peripheral CASES (or case marking postpositions); I see these contrasts as relevant
only to clause level roles (see chapter 5 below, where I make similar, though not
identical, distinctions).
      (c) nominal expressions (NPs and PPs) realising circumstantial roles of
Means (section 5.2.3.3), Manner (section 5.2.3.4), Cause (section 5.2.3.6) and a
subset of the Accompaniment roles (see section 5.2.3.5) in clauses of directed
action.
      (d) nominal expressions functioning as Attributes of Agents (section
5.2.4).
      (e) non-finite VPs in the circumstantial role of Manner in clauses of
directed action, as in example (5-332); and in non-finite VPs functioning as
Attributes of the Actor (not necessarily an Agent) in any clause type- see
examples (5-278) and (5-279).
      When it marks the Agent, the ergative postposition is optional except
when the Agent is inanimate, in which case it is obligatory (see page 319 below
for further discussion). In the other circumstances of its occurrence, its presence
is usually obligatory - there are just a handful of instances in which, on
repetition of the utterance, the ergative postposition was dropped from a
circumstantial expression involving -binyi PER- see section 3.7.2.8 below.
      Not only does the ergative postposition sometimes not occur where
expected- that is, it fails to mark an Agent- but occasionally also it occurs
where it is not expected, in an intransitive clause. The second use of -ngga ERG
mentioned under (e) is one instance of this type. There are also examples in
which the Actor of an intransitive clause is marked with -ngga ERG. One such
example is
     (3-83) yoowarni -ngga I yoowarni -ngga gardiya I Cherrabun Bore I
            one         ERG one            ERG white:man
            warangji I gamba I bambimnga -widdangi booloomani -yoo I
            he:sat      water      he:pumped:it for:them cattle         DAT
            'There was a white man at Cherrabun Bore, who was pumping
                water for cattle.'
     Exactly how such examples as this should be accounted for is not yet clear.
What seems to be a recurrent feature is that the following clause is transitive.
This suggests that the ERG postposition occurs in anticipation of the following
                                  rosrrosmoNs                                   179transitive clause, or alternatively, perhaps that the intransitive clause is an
interpolation. (Some other Australian languages display this phenomenon in
similar circumstances -see Haviland 1979:155 on Guugu Yimidhirr and
McGregor 1979:119 on Ngaanyatjara.) Useful as this explanation may be, it
does not account for the occurrence of the ergative on non-finite VPs in
intransitive clauses (as in example (5-278)).
      Finally, let us remark on the shapes of the two locational terms
ngirndangaddingga 'this side (usually of a body of water)' and
ngooddoongaddingga 'that side (usually of a body of water)'. These are evidently
constructed from the determiners ngirnda 'this' and ngooddoo 'that', with the
addition of -ngaddingga, which might plausibly be analysed as the sequence
-ngaddi-ngga COMIT+ERG. If this is the case, at least as an historical
derivation of the above forms, this may (partly) account for the formal identity
of the Gooniyandi ergative postposition with one of the allomorphs of the
locative found in many Pama-Nyungan languages, and suggest an origin for the
former in a locative marker. (That the locative and ergative morphemes coincide
in some Australian languages (for instance, Mparntwe Arrernte - Wilkins in
preparation) attests to the plausibility of a historical derivation such as this.)3.7 .2.2 -yoo -    -woo DATive
The dative postposition -yoo- -woo marks units in both clause rank roles ((c),
(d) and (f) below), and phrase rank roles ((a), (b) and (e) below).
      (a) Possessors, both alienable and inalienable- see example (4-11) below
- are marked by the dative, provided that the possessor is realised by a nominal
expression. Where the possessor is referred to by a pronominal, a distinct
oblique case form of that pronoun is used instead- see examples (3-72) to
(3-74) above.
      (b) Attached to an oblique pronominal, -yoo DAT indicates that the referent
of the pronoun is someone or something who is not necessarily in possession of
an item, but has some access to it, to use it in certain ways, when that item is
for the benefit of the person or thing. Example:
     (3-84) ngirndaji riwi mangaddi ngaddagi -yoo -miya              yaddangi

180                                Tim WORDThis is also a possible sense of the dative when attached to a nominal
expression, but the difference is formally apparent only when the dative is
attached to a pronominal.
It should be noted that the sense I am alluding to here is independent of
ownership: it could be that in some sense the speaker and his group do own the
place referred to in (3-84). But this possession is irrelevant. The contrast here is
not one of temporary vs. permanent ownership, or of present vs. future or
imminent ownership.
      (c) A nominal expression realising the Goal participant in a middle clause
(see section 5.2.1.3 and example (5-66)), or the Affected participant in a clause
of another transitivity type (see 5.2.2.1) is marked by -yoo DAT.
      (d) Nominal expressions and non-finite clauses fulfilling the circumstantial
roles of Purpose (sections 5.2.3.7 and 5.5.2.4) and Matter (sections 5.2.3.8 and
5.5.2.4) are marked by the dative postposition.
      (e) Within an NP also, the dative postposition may mark a qualifying
expression {either a nominal expression or a non-finite clause) which indicates
the purpose of the referent thing, or a respect in which some attribute holds of it
-see example (5-299).
      (f) -Yoo OAT frequently, although not always, marks nominal and
adverbial expressions referring to future time (see below section 5.2.3.2).
      As was the case with the ergative postposition, the dative postposition is
occasionally absent where its presence is expected. This occurs in circumstance
(b), where it marks the Goal or Affected participant. An example is (3-85)- see
also example (5-70).
      (3-85) maningga wardnginhi::         ri ? maJa I George Rundin
             night       I:went:up:to:him          boss     [name]
             migaliminhi I
             I:told:him
             'That night I went to the boss, and told him, George Rundin.'
What is common across the circumstances pertaining to the omission of both
the ERG and the OAT is that the postposition is omissible if and only if the
phrase is also cross-referenced in the verb. This certainly suggests that the
presence of the postposition may have something to do with disambiguation;
however, it will be shown below (pages 319-320) that there are insurmountable
problems with this hypothesis, and that it must be rejected.

                                      POSTPOSIDONS                                    181    3.7.2.3 -ya     LOCative
    The postposition -ya LOC indicates:
          (a) location in space 'at', 'in'. 'on', 'near', 'into' (as in 'pour water into a
    bucket'), and so on. It may be either the whole event or process that is located
    (see below page 316 and section 5.2.3.1), or one entity in that event or process
    (see page 332). In either case, the LOC marked phrase usually fulfils a clausal
    role; examples like (4-80) in which it fulfils a qualifying role in another phrase
    are decidedly rare.
          When the place is referred to by its name, the LOC marker is frequently
    omitted. This seems to be invariably true when that name ends in the syllable
    ya, as in the place name Goobardiya. Although there are tens, if not hundreds of
    instances of this place as a location in my corpus, not once does the form
    Goobardiya-ya 'at Goobardiya' occur.
          (b) time 'at' or time 'in'- section 5.2.3.2 below.
          (c) accompaniment 'with', where the accompanying thing is a human-
    see section 5.2.3.5 below.
          (d) something to be avoided or something feared- see section 5.2.3.9.
          (e) location in something other than a place, that is, a circumstance,
    especially one which enables the process to occur - that is, a type of
    contemporaneous cause. Examples are 'see in torchlight', and
         (3-86) booloomani gamoo boordbara -ya                gambawindi
                bullock      milk      hot       LOC          it: became:water
                'The butter melted in the heat.'
         (f) a body part at which a violent action connects with the patient. For
    example:
         (3-87) midda -ya      gardlooni
                heal LOC I:hit:him
                'I hit him in the head.'
    More usually a body part of the patient is treated as a Range (section 5.2.2.2),
    and realised by an NP - see McGregor (1985) for further details and an
    explanation of the meaning contrast.
          (g) a process going on at the same time as the main process. This sense
    occurs only when -ya LOC is attached to a non-finite verb (/clause). However,
    this construction is quite infrequent.
182                                THE WORD3.7.2.4 -nhingi ABLative 1
This postposition indicates:
      (a) the place from which the process or action - normally one which
involves or implies the movement of some entity - started; see section
5.2.3.1.
      (b) time, circumstance, or event after which the process occurred- see
section 5.2.3.2 and 5.5.2.1.
      (c) the cause of a situation- see sections 5.2.3.6 and 5.5.2.1.
      (d) the initial state of an entity when it itrst becomes involved in a process
-see page 359.
       As has already been mentioned, -nhingi phrases may, in addition to
fulfilling clausal roles, fulfil NP roles, usually those of Classifier and Qualifier
(see section 4.1.2.1). In these cases, the referent Entity itself, rather than the
process, is claimed to originate from a source. The major functions of -nhingi
ABL 1 in this context are to indicate:
      (e) the animate source of a bodily product, e.g. gambinyi jirigi-nhingi (egg
bird-ABL 1) 'a bird's egg'. (Animate beings are never treated as 'owners' of bodily
products, and referred to by DAT PPs or oblique pronominals.)
      (f) the originator of words, stories, songs, etc., as in ngaboo-nhingi
thangarndi (father-ABL1 word) 'god's word/story'.
      (g) a temporal or spatial origin of an individual or thing, as in balyoowa-
nhingi yoowooloo (behind-ABL 1 man) 'today's people', and gaddwaroo-nhingi
wayandi (afternoon-ABL1 flre) 'the fire from yesterday (i.e. the fire which was
started yesterday)'.
      Very rarely -nhingi ABL1 functions to derive a new lexical stem. One
example is provided by the nickname wayandi-nhingi (fire-ABL1) which was
applied to a man who, as a child, had rolled into a fire.3.7.2.5 -yangga ABLative2
Like -nhingi ABL 1, this postposition also indicates a source or origin. The
difference from -nhingi ABL 1 seems to be one of viewpoint: -yangga ABL2
occurs when the situation is being viewed as emanating from its source or
origin; -nhingi ABL 1 by contrast is used when the situation is viewed from the
perspective of a subsequent time or place - after the connection with the source
has been severed. Thus -yangga AB~ frequently translates into English as 'away
from':
                                POSTPOSIDONS                                 183     (3-88) wardji jilji       -yangga
            he:went sandhill AB~
            'He walked away from the sandhill' or 'He was walking away from
                the sandhill.'
      By contrast, the use of a -nhingi ABL1 PP here could have the effect of
referring to the movement at a later stage, e.g. when the source was no longer
visible. There is of course no real-world cut off point, such that if the thing
moved beyond it, a speaker would be forced to use -nhingi ABL1 : this is why I
have referred to the choice as one of viewpoint.
      In clauses which describe situations in which something issues forth or
emerges from a source, that source will be referred to by a -yangga ABL:z PP,
and not by a -nhingi ABL 1 PP. Examples include the issuing of water from a
pipe or from the mouth (as in example (3-89) below), emergence of a person
from a cave, emergence of a bodily product from the body, launching of an
object from a car, removal of something (e.g. a thorn) from a place (e.g. a leg),
and so on. Perhaps by extension, processes such as looking may emanate from a
source, the location of the sensate being (example (3-90)). (Note that the source
of such processes never seems to be a body part, as might be expected in parallel
to (3-89); such body parts seem to be always treated as Agents.)     (3-89) gamha boodladdi nganyi -ngga thangarndi -yangga
            water I:sprayed:it I        ERG mouth    ABL:z
            'I sprayed water from my mouth.'
     (3-90) banyangi -yangga I yamadi -yangga milanginbidda
            outside   AB~       I car       ABLz    they:saw:me
            They looked at me from afar I from the car.'
      There is a single example available in which a -yangga ABLz PP indicates
a cause: that is example (5-269) of section 5.2.3.6 below. Significantly, the
situation referred to in this example is a happening (see pages 326-327),
occurring at the same time that the process of the embedded clause took place:
contrast the -nhingi ABL1 cause, where the cause always temporally precedes the
effect.
      Another use of the postposition -yangga ABL 2 is illustrated in the
following examples:
     (3-91) nyawa -yangga riddwa
            tail      ABLz you:will:pull:it
            'Pull it by the tail.'
184                                TilE WORD      (3-92) jabiddi -yangga rooddoobmi        jinali
             point ABL:z he:pulled:it:out spear
             'He pulled out the spear by the end.'
     Here the -yangga ABL:z PP refers to a part of a Goal at which the action-
always one of induced motion - is effected.
     Especially in this use it is tempting to analyse -yangga ABLz into -ya
LOC plus -ngga ERG. However, even if this is historically valid, it is
impossible as a synchronic analysis. For, in all of the uses discussed above, this
postposition is regularly stressed on its initial syllable; it is not stressed as a
sequence of postpositions.
     Unlike -nhingi ABL1o -yangga ABL 2 is never used attributively, or to form
a new lexical stem. This is consistent, I believe, with the semantic analysis
proposed in this and the previous section: an entity is not likely to be
characterised by the fact that it is breaking contact with something else,
although it is likely to be characterised by a prior association with another
thing.3.7.2.6 -yidda ALLative 1
This postposition occurs attached to nominals, oblique pronominals and
adverbials, but not to verbals. It marks:
      (a) a fmal terminus (place, position, or thing) to which the process extends
and actually reaches. In clauses involving motion of some entity, this is the
final place that that entity reaches (see section 5.2.3.1); where there is no
motion, it is an endpoint of a body (see section 5.2.1.2.1).
      (b) a terminal state or condition of an entity - see examples and
discussion in section 5.2.4 below.3.7.2.7 -yayi        ALLative 2 , -yayoo           ALLative 3 and -ya woo
ALLative 4
These three postpositions, which appear to be used only in 'local', and with one
exception, spatial senses, indicate the direction towards which the action
proceeded. Unlike -yidda ALL 1, they do not indicate the final destination: they
indicate only that the action proceeded in the direction of a certain place or thing.
No indication is given as to whether or not this place or thing was ever reached,
or was at any stage an intended destination. I have been unable to discern any
semantic differences between the three forms.
                                POSTPOSIDONS                                  185      The exception referred to in the previous paragraph concerns -yawoo ALL4 •
This postposition is sometimes used in the sense of 'time until', when attached
to a nominal such as dina 'dinner', or manyi 'vegetable food'.
      All three postpositions are apparently built on -ya LOC. In two cases the
increment is identical with a form of the dative postposition, either -yoo or -woo
(see above). And the remaining form could easily have arisen from -yayoo AL~
by a vocalic change (see section 2.2.5). However, all three are synchronically
unanalysable, being stressed as a single form. The above is, however, a possible
historical source of the forms: in a number of Australian languages the allative
is either built on, or is identical with the dative or the locative. In the
neighbouring Jaru, for example, the allative is, according to Tsunoda (1981:55),
built on the locative, with the addition of -wu, which is an allomorph of the
dative.
      We can summarise the system of ""lative"" postpositions as shown in Table
3-6.
                    Table 3-6: System of lative postpositions                           Focus on the terminus Focus on the motion
         Motion towards -yidda                      -yayi, -yayoo, -yawoo
         Motion from    -yangga                     -nhingi      That the three allative postpositions -yayi ALL2 , -yayoo ALL3 , and -yawoo
ALL4 are restricted to occurring on nominals would seem to be consistent with
this analysis. For their presence on adverbials would be semantically redundant:
spatial adverbials either have distinct 'direction towards' forms, or this is a
possible sense of the adverbial in a clause of motion. When -yidda ALL1 occurs
on a spatial adverbial, the relationship it encapsulates becomes concretised as a
separate entity, which may be the destination of a process of motion. Thus, the
adverbial banyangi 'outside' may occur in a clause of motion with the
postposition -yidda ALL 1 attached. Alternatively, it may occur unmarked by a
postposition in the same clause type. There is a difference in meaning: in the
latter case the motion is represented as directed towards the outside of some
containing medium, whereas in the former case it is represented as actually
reaching some place which forms the outside of some reference place.
186                                  'IHEWORD3.7.2.8 -binyi PERiative
This postposition may be attached to nominal and adverbial words, but not to
verbals or (it appears) to pronominals. -Binyi PER indicates:
      (a) direction or orientation of motion with respect to a non-terminal point
along a path, covering the senses 'through', 'along', 'beside', 'around', 'past', 'via',
etc. - see examples (5-123) and (5-124) of section 5.2.3.1. As the following
examples show, the process need not necessarily be one of motion:
      (3-93) biliga -binyi danggalmi
             middle PER he:chopped:it
             'He chopped (the carcass) through the middle.'
      (3-94) yoowarni -binyi bagingi
             one          PER I:Iay
             'I lay on/along one (side) (of the camp).'
      (b) foodstuffs sought after, in clauses referring to hunting and gathering
activities. For example,
      (3-95) birla -binyi widdijjawila
             yam PER I:might:dig:it
             'I want to go digging for yams.'
      (3-96) moowyawila        thiddoo -binyi
              I:might:search kangaroo PER
              'I want to go looking for kangaroos.'
      -Binyi PER contrasts with -yoo DAT which can also mark a thing sought
after. The dative treats it as a type of 'purpose'. On the other hand, when -binyi
PER occurs, there is never a specific entity in mind as the ultimate goal of the
action. (Consequently, something sought after is never cross-referenced by an
oblique bound pronominal in the VP - see (3-96) above; in most other
contexts moow- 'look for, seek' cross-references the thing sought.) There is no
certainty that the desired foodstuff will even be encountered. Within narrative
texts, clauses with this type of -binyi PER phrase are normally 'topical': that is,
they introduce the subject matter of the narrative in the most general way, as
concerned with a particular type of hunting. Following sentences normally
describe the details, the type of action undertaken in order to obtain the food.
When -yoo DAT occurs, there is invariably a specific (though not necessarily
definite) entity in a specific location, which is to be obtained as a result of the
action described in the clause- see examples in section 5.2.3.7.
•                                                                                        ----------

    handed'; in this use, -binyi would appear to fulfil a stem forming function.
        On one occasion only, -binyi PER was followed by the ERG postposition
    - on repetition of the example, the ERG was omitted. The example was:
         (3-97) balyoowa -binyi -ngga gilbawidi         thinga
                behind    PER ERG they:found:him foot
                They found his footprints from behind.'
         An explanation for this phenomenon remains unclear.    3.7.2.9 -ngaddi COMITative
    -ngaddi COMIT marks:
          (a) nominal phrases fulfilling the clausal role of Means - see section
    5.2.3.3. (In transitive and reflexive/reciprocal clauses, as we have already seem,
    -ngaddi COMIT is followed by -ngga ERG.
          (b) nominal phrases in the Accompaniment role, when the accompanying
    and the accompanied entities are of unequal status- see section 5.2.3.5.
          (c) something in close association with an entity, such as a possession.
    The possession may be either alienable (example (4-78)) or inalienable (example
    (3-98)).
         (3-98) ngaragnga goornboo gamoo -ngaddi
                he:made:it woman     breast COMIT
                'He painted a woman with breasts.'
         As examples (4-78) and (3-98) demonstrate, this sense arises when the
    -ngaddi PP fulfils a role in a phrase. It also occurs when the comitative PP
    functions as Attribute in a characterising clause - see section 5.2.1.1.1.2.
    There is, however, as has already been mentioned, no reason to regard nominals
    marked with -ngaddi COMITas derived adjectives (cf. Dixon 1980:324-325).
         Finally, there are a few apparently irregular uses of -ngaddi COMIT, in
    which this postposition seems to function as a stem forming suffix:
    yoowarningaddi (one-COMIT) 'once', ngirndangaddi (this-COMIT) 'this way',
    ngirndangaddingga (this-COMIT-ERG) 'this side'. ngooddoongaddingga (that-
    COMIT-ERG) 'that side', yinigangaddi (somehow-COMIT) 'by some means, by
    what means'. There are also half a dozen or so mother-in-law avoidance
    nominals, including bin.gidi-ngaddi (feather-COMIT) 'bird' and wanya-ngaddi
    (emu feather-COMIT) 'emu', which are analysable as ordinary nominal plus the
188                                THE WORDcomitative postposition.3.7.2.10 -winyja DEPrivative
The postposition -winyja DEP is quite infrequent in occurrence, and seems to be
used in only one function. That is, to indicate something - always a thing,
never a process - the lack of which causes an event to occur; see section
5.2.3.6 and examples (5-159) and (5-160).
      It should be noted that Gooniyandi has no bound morpheme, either suffix
or postposition, that functions as a regular privative marker. Instead, to express
this meaning, the negative particle marlami 'nothing, without' is used following
(usually) the nominal referring to the thing lacked. The contrast between these
two expressions, NP-winyja, and [N mar/ami], is that the former has the
additional semantic component, absent from the latter, that the lack of the thing
is the cause of the process. In keeping with this, only the latter occurs in
relational clauses expressing 'x has no y'.3.7.2.11 -yooddoo - -yiddi DUal and -yarndi PLural
These two postpositions, -yooddoo- -yiddi DU and -yarndi PL, optionally mark
the number of an NP as either dual or plural (three or more) respectively. As yet
it is not clear what factors motivate the occurrence or non-occurrence of these
morphemes on non-singular NPs. (A likely hypothesis is that they are used: (i)
in initial specification of number, and otherwise (ii) to help keep reference clear,
for instance when a text involves two (or more) groups of items which would be
referred to by the same nominal, but which consist of different numbers of these
items. But this hypothesis has not been tested by extensive textual
investigation.) Examples of usage include (4-77), (4-86), (4-95), (4-96), and
lines (5), (21) and (61) of Text 1, and line (6) of Text 2.","[162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173]"

          APPENDIX 3: LIST OF BOUND MORPHEMESThis appendix lists all allomorphs of bound closed-class morphemes, with the
exception of those fonns deriving from the regular application of the sandhi
rules described in section 2.4. References are made to the section(s) containing
major discussions of the conditioning factors, occurrence and semantics of these
morphemes.
      CL indicates classifier; PF indicates prefix, either pronominal or tense, to
the classifier (section 3.9.3.2); INF indicates infinitive; SF indicates stem-
forming suffix; EN indicates enclitic; and P indicates postposition. Suffixes and
enclitics that are restricted in occurrence to the VP are denoted by VSF and VEN
respectively. [C] marks those exceptional bisyllabic morphemes (all {w}-initial)
which do not bear inherent stress, and which cohere with the preceding
phonological word. (VR6 applies to delete the initial segment, except when the
following vowel is (oo}; the resulting vowel sequence is modified as per VRS).
An asterisk marks those morphemes which do not undergo the sandhi rules
which apply at their initial boundary type.

"5.3.2 Thematisation
The other major component in the textual metafunction, thematisation, has the
clause or clause complex (see sections 5.6.2.1.3 and 5.6.2.2 below) as its
domain. The THEME in Gooniyandi, as in English, is indicated by position: it
occurs first in the clause. From this perspective, the clause has the structure
Theme""Rheme. Since the Theme is frequently chosen from the register of given
information (cf. Halliday 1970:162, Dan~ 1974:114ff), it is prone to ellipsis.
There are thus a number of apparent exceptions to the ordering generalisation. I
will return to this point below. In the meantime, attention will be restricted to
clauses with explicit Themes.
       The term 'theme' as it is commonly employed in both Praguean and
systemic theories has two main senses. It can mean (i) the starting point or the
point of departure of what the speaker has to say, and (ii) the subject matter,
what the speaker is talking about (cf. Halliday 1967:212, and Dane~ 1974:113).
These two senses sometimes coincide, and sometimes do not. For instance, the
first clause in the reply of B in (5-223) below has Theme jamoondoo 'other day',
which serves as a convenient ""peg"" on which to pin the clause - and indeed the
whole of the reply. The speaker was not, however, talking about the other day.
     (5-223) A: niyaji gawi ngoorndoo -ga ngangginggi
                this   fish someone ERG he:gave:it:to:you
372                               THE CLAUSE              B: jamoondoo milayidda  wardji             gawi -binyi
                 other:day we:saw:him he: went           fish    PER
                  goomboo wardji        nzya)l -ngga     ngangngindi
                 woman      he:went this   ERG he:gave:it:to:me
              A: 'Who gave you this fish?'
              B: The woman who we saw the other day going fishing gave it
                    to me.'
The Theme of the third clause of B's reply, goornboo 'woman', is thematic in
the second sense: it is what the clause - in fact the whole utterance - is about
      Another type of Theme found in Gooniyandi is illustrated in
      (5-224) goomboo manili thigi
              woman nose      short
              The woman has a short nose.'
      (5-225) yoowooloo yingi jawalyi
              man         name [subsection term]
              The man is of the jawalyi subsection.'
These clauses consist of three NPs, each one word in length. (The first two
words do not constitute an NP together- see page 253 above.) The second and
third words (also phrases) together constitute characterising clauses, the second
word (!phrase) being characterised by the third. The first word (!phrase) however
bears no experiential role in the clause. But rather it establishes a starting point,
a 'frame' within which the main predication holds (cf. Chafe 1976:50). I will
refer to Themes of this type as Topics, following Chafe (1976).1t is the second
word (/phrase) in each case that the clause is really 'about'; this constituent
constitutes a second Theme for the clause.
      Topics typically establish an owner or possessor of a thing bearing some
experiential role in the clause. Where the possession is alienable, as in (5-226) a
possessive pronominal referring to the owner is required in the NP referring to
the possessed entity.
      (5-226) ngaddagi ngaddanyi I ngaja   nhoowoo I
              my       mother      brother his
              ng~i        nyaanyil
              my       uncle
              'My mother's brother is my uncle.'
topicalisation is also used to establish a location, with respect to which a second
location is established. For example,
                 THE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE ClAUSE                          373      (5-227) mayaroo Quanbun I niyi -nhingi -ngga lilinggaa
              house                that ABL1 ERG west
              birndiddi -ya I gardbini I
              plane      LOC he:hit:hlm
              'To the west of Quanbun homestead, on the plain, he killed him.'
      Topicalisation is frequently used where embedding would be used in
English. In examples such as (5-226) either embedding or topicalisation may be
used in Gooniyandi, although the latter predominates. But where the depth of
embedding is greater, topicalisation only can be used (see above page 281.)
      The Topic is a particular type of Theme, one which bears no experiential
role in the clause in which it occurs. Instead, it has some experiential role in a
phrasal IC of the clause; that is, in some experiential role within the clause.
This phrase is typically (as in examples (5-226) and (5-227) above) thematic in
the clause, in the sense that is is what the clause is about. Thus, in the
topicalisation pattern there are two distinct types of Theme, the Topic and the
Theme proper. The former invariably precedes the latter. The second Theme, or
the Theme proper, is enabled by, or is established by the Topic.
It seems that Topics do not necessarily enable or establish Themes, although they
normally do. In
      (5-228) ngooddoo -yoo yoowooloo garingi ngirndaji
              that       DAT man              wife       this
              nhoowoo thodda
              his        dog
              This is that man's wife's dog',
the Topic ngooddooyoo yoowoo/oo garingi 'that man's wife' enables the Rheme,
nhoowoo thadda 'her dog'. Compare also (4-82) above - in this example the
enabled PP may, however, be interpreted as a second Theme (see below pages 378-
379).
     One of the reasons for employing the topicalisation pattern is that it
assigns more 'weight', or greater thematic prominence to the possessor than it
does to the possession. In general, the possessor is thematic over a stretch of
discourse larger in size than a single clause, whereas an enabled possession is
typically a WCAL Theme of a single clause. See, for example, line {7) of Text
2, where the name, once established, is no longer of interest. Secondly, the
Topical Theme may be a starting point which, although not experientially
relevant to the situation, is most easily anchored in the context. It is typically a
prominent land-mark, as is the case in (5-227), and line (75) of Text 1. From it,
something experientially relevant to the present clause may be established.
     Themes are often set off in separate information units. Such Themes occur
374                              THE CLAUSEon separate secondary intonation contours which are characterised by a slight rise
in pitch on the final syllable (cf. Kilham 1977:83). This serves to give some
degree of prominence to the Theme, and usually happens only when the Theme
conveys new information. An example, from the beginning of a text, is
      (5-229) yoowarni -ngga I yoowarni -ngga gardiya I
              one          ERG    one        ERG white:person
              cherrabun bore I warangji I gamba I bambimnga
              [place name]      he: sat     water    he:pumped:it
              -widdangi boorloomani -yoo I
               for:them bullocks        OAT
              There was a white man at Cherrabun Bore pumping water for the
                 cattle.'
Another example is (5-195) above- Ned Colins was introduced for the first
time in this clause.
      Topical Themes are very frequently segmented (i.e. occur on their own
information unit) - on the whole more frequently than is the case for other
Themes. See sentences (5-226) and (5-227) above, and line (7) of Text 2. (The
fact that the constituent immediately following the Topic can also be set in its
own information unit adds support to the claim above that this constituent is a
second Theme.)
On rare occasions a Theme set off on its own information unit is unmarked for its
experiential role in the clause of which it appears to be a part:
      (5-230) ngaddagi yawarda I jadil yoodli -nhi I
               my         horse       saddle l:put:it    on:him
               'My horse, I saddled it.'
The phrase [ngaddagi yawarda] 'my horse' ought to be in a syntagm with a DAT
postposition.","[355, 356, 357, 358]"
"      The examples above show yiniga 'in some/what manner' and miga 'in
this/that manner' in NPs as well as in clausal circumstantial roles. They also
occur as lexical heads of VPs, yiniga carrying the meaning 'do/say something or
what' and miga meaning 'say, speak, think'. (Examples are (5-324), (5-331) and
(5-332) below.)3.4.1 Adverbs
Adverbs qualify the process, indicating the manner in which it was done, or in
which it occurred. For example,
      (3-31) banixJdda  wardft
             slowly     he:went
             'He walked slowly.'
     Adverbs are defined as those words which may realise the circumstance of
Manner (see section 5.2.3.4); this role may also be realised by NPs and PPs.
Included in the class are words denoting speed (e.g. barnbadda 'slowly',
thilmangga 'rapidly', galjini 'quickly, fast'), force (e.g. maya 'hard, forcefully',
janggoo 'lightly, a bit', thirili 'energetically'), human characteristics (e.g.
doomagoomagoo 'slurringly', gabaaba 'clumsily', biyari 'sneakingly'), and
material qualities (such as mooddoo 'backwards', ngaladda 'on one's back',
blanbidda 'on one's front').
     Adverbs may in addition realise phrasal roles within NPs and VPs:
      (3-32) maya .aHz -ymdda mud -gali
             hard  MNR MNR go      CHAR
             'a hard walker'
      (3-33) waya thiddgirli -windi
             wire straight      it:got
             'The wire got straight.'
•
                                        ADVERBIALS                                 155
    3.4.2 Temporal adverbials
    Temporal adverbials constitute a fairly small class, most of whose members
    refer to points of time, and are used to locate processes temporally; in addition
    there are just a few which indicate temporal duration. The first group includes:
    words for the seasons,3 baddangga 'dry season', moonggoowarla 'winter' and
    yidirla 'wet season'; words primarily referring to part of the day, maningga 'night
    time', bilgaali 'midnight', gaddwaroo 'afternoon, yesterday', gaddagaddwaroo 'late
    afternoon', lanygiya 'daytime, midday', moongaya 'morning', moongamoongaya
    'tomorrow morning', etc.; and the three shifters (Jakobson 1957), yaningi 'today,
    now, then (at that point of time)', ngamoo 'before, already', and wamba 'later,
    still'. (These last three are also found in the role of Propositional Modifier-
    see sections 5.4.1, 6.4.10, 6.4.11 and 6.4.13.) There are also words locating the
    event in the near or the distant past: jamoondoo 'the other day', ngaddanggarni
    'long ago, in the dreamtime'. The second group includes yinggi 'for some time',
    yinggiyila 'for a short while', and yilba 'for good, forever'.
            Some temporal adverbials can enter into syntagms with others. These
    syntagms are very restricted in nature, the first member usually being yaningi
    'today' or jamoondoo 'other day', the second, a word signifying a part of the day.
    For example,
         (3-34) yaningi gaddwaroo
                 today      afternoon
                 'this afternoon'
         (3-35) jamoondoo maningga
                other:day     night
                'the other night'
    Very occasionally the word order is reversed, as in
         (3-36) maningga yaningi
                night     today
                'tonight'
         These constructions will be regarded as word complexes, because the    3 That the words for the seasons and parts of the day are adverbials rather than
    nominals (as they are in in English) is evidenced by the fact that they realise
    circumstantial roles of temporal location without having the LOC postposition
    attached, as is necessarily the case for nominals.
156                                TIIEWORDsecond member expands on the first, making its reference more precise (see 5.6.2
below); in each example it is clear that neither word modifies or qualifies the
other. Temporal adverbials are also found in apposition with PPs, forming
complexes with them:
      (3-37) ngamoo nganyi mar/ami -ya         ngaragbidda boojabij
            before me         nothing LOC they:made:it post:office
            'Before my time they built the old post office.'
    Temporal adverbials of the locational type are sometimes found in PPs
where they may fulfil the functions of Classifier (example (4-29)) and Entity, as
in:
      (3-38) yaanya -ya       gaddwaroo
             other     LOC afternoon
             'the other afternoon'3.4.3 Spatial adverbials
Gooniyandi has a rich set of spatial adverbials, which function to qualify the
location, direction, orientation, extent, proximity, etc. of an event, process or
entity with respect to some chosen point(s) of reference. As is the case with
other adverbials, the spatial ones realise clausal roles of circumstance, and are
generally mutually substitutable with PPs. Again they give information of quite
a different type to that given by PPs, and it is quite common to find spatial
adverbials and PPs in apposition (see section 4.3.2 below).
      Two major subclasses may be identified on semantic grounds: cardinals and
non-cardinals. Cardinals orientate entities or situations spatially with reference to
an absolute reference system, determined by the world. By contrast, non-cardinals
mediate through ephemeral'co-ordinates', set up by the speaker, such as (the
speaker's) location or direction or movement. In this sense, non-cardinals are
inherently (i.e. in their lexical meaning) deictic. We will discuss the two types
in order.
      Cardinals orientate horizontally with respect to the points of the compass
and the direction of flow of a river or creek, and vertically either upwards or
downwards. In normal speech, cardinals are very frequent; clauses of motion
nearly always specify direction through their use, often together with a PP
(which might indicate, for example, the actual place to or from which motion
was directed). They are usually employed in giving directions, for which the
terms for left and right are almost never used. For instance, on one occasion
•
                                      ADVERBIALS                                   157
    when I was driving through the bush in a four wheel drive vehicle with a group
    of Bayulu people, whenever they advised me to alter my course, it was with
    respect to the compass points. They used the 'direction to' forms (see Table 3-2),
    simply stating them as one word utterances: e.g.lilinggoo '(Veer more) towards
    the west'.
          Cardinals are not, however, restricted to clauses of motion or rest, although
    they are less frequent elsewhere. A clause of directed action (section 5.2.1.3) may
    specify the direction in which the action was attempted; this is usually done
    only when there was no specific goal, or the goal was not reached. For example:
         (3-39) thaanoonggoo mila/a
                upwards        I:saw:it
                'I looked upwards.'
          Four compass points or directions are distinguished: north, south, east and
    west; and for each of these there are four distinct forms distinguishing location,
    side/end, direction from, and direction towards. The forms are as shown below in
    Table 3-2.
                        Table 3-2: Compass points and directions
                         North               South       East          West
     Location            biddi,         ngiyi             ngila        liya,
                           boowooddoo                                     liyaani
     Side/End            booddoonggoowa ngiwa-            ngilmi,      lilingganyi,
                                          woowa            ngila-       lilinggoowa
                                                            nggoowa
     Direction from    boowooddoongoo ngirnali            ngilmangi liyarnali
     Direction towards booddoonggoo   ngiwawoo            ngilanggoo lilinggoo         The location forms indicate that the location of a process or entity is to the
    north, south, east, or west of some reference point, which is normally the
    speech situation. For example:
         (3-40) biddi warangbiddi
                north they:sat
                'They sat in the north (from here).'
          I have been unable to detect any difference in meaning between the two
    location forms given for north and west.
                                                                 --------------~-    ~
158                                mE WORD     The side/end forms refer to the north, south, east, or west side or end of a
body, usually a topographic feature such as a mountain range or body of water.
An example is
      (3-41) girili waraari    ngilanggoowa
             tree itstands eastem:end
             'The tree stands on the eastern end (of a row of trees).'
     It is evident that the side/end forms are constructed from the direction
towards forms by the addition of -wa. It may be that this -wa is the adverbialiser
'way' (discussed in section 3.12.3.1), which indicates here the 'mode' or 'aspect'
towards the north, south, east or west of a particular body. Note that in all but
the most careful speech /oowa/ is realised by /aa/ (cf. VR6 of section 2.4.2.3.1).
Finally, it is not clear whether, and if so how, the forms ngilmi 'east side/end'
and lilingganyi 'west side/end' differ from the regular -wa forms.
      Direction from forms indicate that the process emanates from the north,
south, east or west. The process is usually seen from the point of view of its
completion, rather than as issuing from a source.

             he:emerged from:the:south
             'He arrived from the south.'
     Direction towards forms indicate that the process is directed towards the
north, south, east, or west. In contrast with direction from, the process is here
viewed from the midst, not necessarily from an endpoint. For example,
      (3-43) ngilanggoo         wardfiddi
             towards:the:east   we:went
             'We went east.'
      Table 3-3 shows the terms for the vertical directions, for which there are
again four distinct forms, making the same systemic distinctions as the compass
point adverbials.

                I:went down:wards
                'I walked down.'
          Note that side/end refers to an aspect of a material body, either the under-
    side or the top-side - and in many circumstances babaabiddi translates into
    English as 'inside', and lanngaddi (etc.) as 'on top or. (I am unable to distinguish
    differences in meaning among the three words in the ""above side/end"" box in
    Table 3-3.) As {3-44) indicates, the terms for 'up' and 'down' allow for horizontal
    displacement at the same time. Another illustration of this is that motion
    between Junjuwa village, which lies on a small hill bearing the same name, and
    the river is usually referred to in these terms, in preference to compass
    orientation, even though the height difference is quite small.
          The forms for the two sets of cardinals are suppletive, and bear little
    resemblance to the shapes of the corresponding 'case-marking' postpositions.
    The main morphological regularities are as follows:
          -nggoo in the direction towards forms;
          -rnali - -ngoo - -ngi in the direction from forms; and
160                                'lliEWORD      ·wa in the side/end forms of the compass directions, which, as I suggested
           above, may be the adverbialiser ·wa (see section 3.12.3.1).
      The first two of these regularities, however, admit exceptions, and the
forms to which the above are suffixed are not predictable. Thus it is probably
not worth while attempting to segment the forms synchronically. It would
appear that to derive the forms regularly from underlying forms would involve as
many complications as are actually found in the paradigm.
      Two further terms, gindiwa 'upstream' andjibiddi 'downstream', are used in
indicating direction and location with respect to a river or creek. There are no
distinct forms for location vs. direction.
      (3-48) gindiwa    waranggooddoo
             upstream they:sit
             'They live upstream.'
      (3-49) jibiddi     wardji
             downstream he:went
             'He went downstream.'
       -Wa may be added to each term, giving the forms gindiwaa and jibiddaa (by
rule VR6 of section 2.4.2.3.1) which, like the side/end forms of the compass
point terms, indicate location on the upstream or downstream end of a body such
as a line of trees beside a watercourse.
       But the meaning of the two terms gindiwa 'upstream' and jibiddi
'downstream' is more general than suggested by the above. They can refer to
movement in constricted mediums such as hollow logs, holes in the ground,
caves, arteries and veins in the body, the choice apparently depending on the
expected direction in which water would flow, and/or on whether it is towards or
away from what is considered to be the source or 'upper' endpoint. Loosely,
gindiwa suggests movement against the direction of flow and towards the source,
while jibiddi suggests movement with the flow or grain, and away from the
source. An example is (3-50), which describes putting food into a cave (see also
line 13 of Text 2):
      (3-50) niyaji -ngga manyi dagooddwaddinga         gindiwa
             this    ERG food   he:put:it:in:repeatedly upstream
             doowoo -ya
             cave      LOC
             'He kept putting food up in a cave.'
      Since creeks and rivers are constricted within their banks, it is possible that
-
                                       ADVERBIALS                                 161
    constriction is a crucial defining property of these two words.
         Non-cardinals may be divided into at least four semantically distinguishable
    subtypes indicating: (a) relative distance; (b) location and orientation with
    respect to a chosen reference point; (c) direction of motion in terms of the
    chosen reference point; and (d) orientation with respect to other entities of the
    same type. These divisions are preliminary, and I do not mean to suggest that
    words must be uniquely one or the other subtype. However, there do turn out to
    be some formal correlates of this division into subtypes.
         (a) There are two terms indicating distance, irrespective of direction:
    marnangooddoo 'far' and graa 'near, close up'. They apply equally to distances
    between objects (the speaker and the eater in (3-51)) and distances covered by
    motion:
         (3-51) ngooddoo marnangooddoo ngabga
                 that        far               he:eats:it
                 'He's eating it there, far away.'
         (3-52) marnangooddoo wardnga
                far              he:took:it
                '(The willy willy) took it a long way away.'
          These distance terms can also be used in qualifying within an NP,
    especially in indicating dimensions of entities which are not normally measured
    as long or short, such as holes, which are either marnangooddoo 'deep' or graa
    'shallow':
         (3-53) girlingiddi   grcn
                 hole         near
                 'shallow hole'
    (It may be that here the terms refer to the bottom of the hole with respect to the
    top -whereas most objects are measured from either end.) Marnangooddoo 'far'
    and graa 'near' are, however, more usually used in attributing a property of an
    NP (i.e. in a characterising clause- see section 5.2.1.1.1.2), than in qualifying
    in an NP.
          (b) Terms indicating relative location include wilajga 'around', riddinggi
    'side, to the side or, balngarna 'outside', biliga 'halfway, middle', balyjoowa
    'behind', wilanggaya 'in front of, ngirndangaddingga 'this side', and
    ngooddoongaddingga 'that side'. Except for balngarna 'outside' and balyjoowa
    'behind', these terms appear to be used exclusively in location, never in motion
    to or from. They frequently occur with LOC PPs which make explicit the
162                                TIIEWORDreference point (see 4.3.2). (Of course, ngirndangaddingga 'this side' and
ngooddoongaddingga 'that side' involve two reference points, the location of the
speaker and some other body, such as a river.)
     Perhaps we should also include here yalambangoo 'same place', which
seems to suggest that the entity will remain located at some particular spot. For
example,
      (3-54) mangaddi riddiggoowawingi yalambangoo            warangngiri
            not        I:will:be:shifting same:place          I:sit
            'I'm not going to shift; I'll stay here in this same place.'
      (c) Terms indicating direction include the following: minaloogoo 'this way,
towards here', banyangi 'away from here', ngiddiwandi 'across (the field of
vision)', thoolngooddoo 'through', ngirndangaddi 'this way' and ngooddoongaddi
'that way'. An example is:
      (3-55) minaloogoo wardngina
             this:way    he:broughtme
             'He brought me towards here.'
      These terms normally occur in clauses referring to motion, where they
usually take the speech situation as reference point. For this reason, they are less
commonly found in syntagms with PPs than are the locationals discussed under
(b) above. However, there may be reasons to express further information, such
as indicating precisely who was involved (when speaking of previous events), or
indicating the source of motion:
      (3-56) ngidi -yooddoo minaloogoo wardjingangi
             \I.e  DU       this:way         he:went:to:us:two
             'He came up towards us.'
      (3-57) wardngi boojabij      -nhingi minaloogoo
             I:went post:office ABL          this:way
             'I came from the post office this way.'
      Except in direct speech, minaloogoo 'this way' does not seem to allow
shifts of reference point, which are, however, possible for the other terms.
      Sometimes these terms are found in clauses other than those referring to
motion. For example,
      (3-58) thoolngooddoo waraari
             through          he:stands
             'He is standing with his back turned (to me).'
•                                       ADVERBIALS                                    163           (d) I distinguish the set of orientating adverbials from the locationals (type
    (b)) because they do not usually locate entities or situations with respect to fixed
    co-ordinates, but rather, indicate the spatial configuration or arrangement of
    (usually) moveable entities, as they are engaged in a situation. Included are:
    wilangi 'ahead', wilangajaddi 'leading, ahead', yalawa 'next to, beside',
    yiddmirnimirni 'level', wandamaddi 'side by side', wandaadda 'in a line, single
    file', and langarnimirnimirni 'into one another (as in run into one another)'.
    Balyoowa 'behind' is used both in location (as discussed under (b)) and
    orientation. Some examples of use of these terms follow:
         (3-59) nganyi wilangajaddi wardngi niyi         balyoowa wardji
                I      alrad        !:went he            behind   he:went
                 'I went ahead; he followed behind.'
         (3-60) wandamaddi     bagoowooddoo
                 side:by:side they:lie
                 'They are lying side by side.'
         (3-61) yiddmirni   giddagiddawiddiyi
                 level       they:two:ran
                 'They two ran level.'
    It is unclear at present exactly how wilangi 'ahead' and wilangajaddi 'ahead,
    leading' differ semantically. Yalawa 'next to, beside' can be distinguished from the
    semantically similar graa 'near', both of which were often translated 'close (up)'.
    Graa 'near' is a measure of distance. Yalawa 'next to, beside', on the other hand,
    does not invoke a measure of relative distance, but indicates the spatial
    arrangement of adjacency. Compare for example (3-62) with (3-63), which are
    typical of the distinct uses:
          (3-62) graa wardbiddingadda
                  close they:went:to:me
                  'They came up close to me.'
          (3-63) yalawa warangbiri
                  close you:will:sit
                  'Sit close (to me).'
         Order of entities is expressed by spatial metaphor using the orientation
    types (d), rather than through a set of ordinal numbers. Thus, objects may be
    ordered wilangi 'leading, first', or balyjoowa 'following, non-lrrst'. Time is also
    ordered in this way, previous time being referred to as wilangi 'ahead', and
    present and future time as baljoowa 'behind'. ""Same time"" also finds a similar
    mode of expression:
 164                               THE WORD       (3-64) mirlimirli binjil   giribbindi yiddmirnimirni giribnyaliwindi
              paper       pencil itfinished level           it:finished:again
              'The pencil and paper ran out together.'
      Spatial adverbials are found in roles other than clausal roles of
circumstance: in NPs they may function as Qualifiers, and in VPs they may
realise the role of Process. The cardinals of compass points and vertical
directions are found in all three contexts. (3-65) and (3-66) show cardinal
adverbials in the roles Qualifier and Process respectively.
       (3-65) raddin.giri NP[midda babooddoonggoo]NP
              he:hangs       head downwards
              '(Flying foxes) hand with heads down.'
       (3-66) warlibiddi w[baabiddiwam]yp
             river          it:fell:down
             'The river went down.'
But the directional adverbials ngiddiwandi 'across' and thoolngooddoo 'through',
and the locational adverbials balngarna 'outside', biliga 'middle' and balyjoowa
'behind' can function as circumstances and Qualifiers only, not as Processes. An
example of one of the directional adverbials in the Qualifier role in an NP is:
       (3-67) marnba thoolngooddoo
              bum       through
              'back turned'3.4.4 Frequency adverbials
There are three frequency adverbials, perspicuously derived from the first three
number words: yoowarningaddi 'once', garndiwiddja 'twice' and ngarlooddja
'thrice'. I have no corresponding form for 'many times', and the word for 'always,
all the time', ngaddarni, is a particle, not an adverbial. An example of use of a
frequency adverbial is:
       (3-68) yoowarningaddi gardboowoo
             ooce            you:will:hit:him
             'Hit him once.'
     Frequency adverbials are also used in counting the number of days over
which a process extends. For example,
•
                                        PARTICLES                                   165
          (3-69) gaddiggoowawingirni ngarlooddja
                 I:might:be:away         thrice
                 'I might be away three/a few days.'
          (3-70) ngar/ooddja bagiyiddi
                 thrice      we:lay
                 We camped (there) for three days.'
          It is possible to be more explicit by using the nominal riwi 'camp, place'
    in the sense of 'day':
          (3-71) yoowarningaddi riwi bagiyiddi
                 once           camp we:lay
                 We camped (there) one day.'","[139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150]"
"    3.3   Nominals
    This class contains those words which usually occur as constituents of nominal
    phrases- although they are sometimes found elsewhere (e.g. as the lexical
    'head' of the finite VP), and words of other classes are frequently found within
    nominal phrases. In the previous section I suggested that nominals may be
    characterised by the fact that they may occur in either of these two contexts:
    always as NP constituents, and potentially as lexical 'heads' of VPs. The class
    so defined is open, and has a very large number of members.
         There seem to be no compelling reasons to identify distinct subclasses of
    adjectives and nouns. Certainly no such subclass can be distinguished on
    morphological grounds, such as the ability to combine with a distinct set of
    morphemes, or their occurrence with a distinct set of allomorphs of the nominal
    morphemes. Furthermore, the classes of words which may realise the NP roles
    of Classifier, Entity, or Qualifier (as defined in section 4.1.2.1 below) have
142                               THE WORDmany members in common. Nearly all words which can realise the Entity role
- excepting non-nominals such as pronouns - can also realise the role
Qualifier (and may also be the lexical 'head' of a VP): in other words, words
which can be referential can also be qualifying, and may indicate qualities or
properties of things.
      There are, however, a number of words which realise either of the roles,
Classifier or Qualifier, but which have not yet been encountered in the Entity
role. Examples include at least twenty words which, from the English speaker's
point of view, would be good candidates for an adjective class. They include:
colours: gooroogooroo 'black', widdgali 'blue, green', lawagimana 'white';
mental attributes: ganybili 'ashamed', yoowa 'frightened, careful', binaddi
     'knowledgeable',jagarndi 'awake', nurna 'greedy';
physical qualities: gawirla 'cold', gijali 'dead', balyadi 'flat', binyidi 'hard',
     jaddarndi 'sharp', damarda 'blunt', giddabingaddi 'long', yanoonggoo 'new',
     thoowoorndoo 'rotten';
value judgements: joornanygadda 'good', marooloo 'valuable'.
      One reason why I hesitate to set these words off as a distinct class is
because semantically similar words do occur in the Entity role, as well as in the
Classifier and Qualifier roles, and so would not be adjectives by the above
criterion. Examples include: thiwa 'red, white person (i.e. person of European
descent)'; boordbara 'hot, heat'; nyamani 'big, boss'; thigi 'short, a bit'; mooyoo
'asleep, sleep'; and thithi 'moving, motion'. It seems to me that the differences
of meaning associated with the different functions are predictable - in each of
the above the first gloss is for the word as a Qualifier or Classifier, the second,
for the word as an Entity, sometimes as a Classifier. Consequently each of the
above forms is a single word, not a pair of homophones. Furthermore, the fact
that the score or so of words listed above have not been encountered in the
Entity function appears to be semantically motivated, and given the appropriate
situation, I would expect that they could be used referentially. For example,
given that boordbara 'hot' is attested in the role of Entity in a nominal phrase
functioning as the Agent of a clause, one would expect that gawirla 'cold' could
also function as the Entity in a nominal phrase in the Gooniyandi version of
'This cold is making me stifr. At this stage of the investigation, it seems to
me, it would be premature to set these words off as a distinct subclass. To do so
would be to take the actually observed 'distribution' too seriously, to ignore the
limitations of the data, and ultimately to deny an aspect of creativity in
language.
•                                          NOMINALS                                      143          It is, however, possible to distinguish some subclasses, nearly all of which
    have a limited number of members: determiners (3.3.1), kin-terms (3.3.2),
    subsection terms (3.3.3), number words (3.3.4} and proper nouns (3.3.5). These
    are semantically homogeneous subclasses, and they often have distinctive
    distributions within the NP, and/or with respect to certain stem-forming
    suffixes.
          For the remainder of the nominal class I have been unable to identify
    subclasses showing distinctive formal and semantic properties. The class of
    nominals includes, in addition to the subclasses mentioned in the preceding
    paragraph: words for concrete objects such as flora {types of plants and trees),
    fauna (various animal species), humans (including sex and age specific terms),
    and their parts ('root', 'tail', 'feather', 'eye', etc.); features of the weather and the
    elements (including 'fire', 'water', 'rain', 'wind', etc.); topographical and
    environmental features (such as 'rock', 'creek', 'hill', 'limestone', etc.); and
    artefacts ('spear', 'boomerang', etc.). Also included are more abstract words for
    songs, rituals, colours, shapes, sizes, feelings ('shame', 'fear', 'anger', etc.), and
    just a few terms for the most common action types ('sleep', 'motion', 'travel' (or
    'walkabout') and 'fight').","[126, 127, 128]"
"      As these two examples (and others elsewhere in the paper) illustrate, the
 primary unit normally contains the propositional nexus- the verbal complex
in clauses with verbs. Secondary units as a rule consist of a single clausal IC, an
NP, PP, or adverbial, the other member of the nexus being implicit.
      It seems likely that this discussion is not restricted to tone units which
 together constitute clauses. I suspect that it applies also to units of clause size
 which go together to form larger sentence-like constructions. In particular,
clauses which on other grounds can be identified as subordinate occur on
secondary tone units: they have the characteristic slight rise on their final
syllable when preceding the main clause, and the low falling contour when
following the main clause.
      We may, on the basis of the foregoing, hypothesise the existence of a
TONIC SENTENCE, consisting of one obligatory primary unit, together with one
or more optional secondary units. In information terms, this would correspond
to a number of information units which together convey closely related
information. The secondary units provide additional information, useful in the
interpretation of the primary unit.
      Within each tone unit, one (or at most two) of the stressed syllables is
particularly prominent. It is usually the most strongly stressed syllable of the
unit, and there is often discernible pitch movement within that syllable. The
significant intonation contour of the unit typically starts on this salient syllable.
In the examples provided in this section, I have used underlining to indicate
salient syllables.
There are different degrees of salience. Some salient syllables are especially
heavily stressed - this is particularly the case for corrections: the initial stressed
syllable of a word which corrects a preceding word uttered by mistake is typically
more strongly stressed than the stressed syllable of the item it corrects. For
example, the initial stressed syllable of ngajangi 'his younger brother' in (5-234)
below is more salient than the stressed syllable of marnawa 'his older brother'
which it corrects. Other salient syllables - particularly in secondary tone units
(which will be discussed below) - are only more slightly stressed than nearby
stressed syllables. This complication may be safely ignored here.
     It is suggested that the salient syllable marks the FOCUS of the
366                               THE CLAUSEinformation uniL The Focus is the item which the speaker presents as the most
newsworthy, and not recoverable from the preceding discourse; it is always NEW,
in terms of the given/new opposition. In using the term 'new' I do not mean to
suggest that the item must not have been mentioned in the (immediately)
preceding text, or that it may not be present in the extralinguistic situation, as
some writers such as Fronek (1983) have suggested. Rather, as Halliday has
pointed out in many places, new properly applies to items that are evaluated as
not predictable in the circumstances of their occurrence. Thus, for instance, an
entity that the speaker may be sure is identifiable by the hearer, or even present
in his consciousness at the time, may be assigned the value of focal or new, if it
fulfils an unpredictable role in the clause, or if, unpredictably, it plays a role in
 the clause at all. This fact has been recognised by Dan~ (1974:111); Chafe, by
contrast, has defined GIVEN as that which is presumed present in the
consciousness of the hearer (1976:30).
        In the view proposed here, given and new are LINGUISTIC categories, and
 the speaker has available the CHOICE of treating a piece of information as one or
 the other. S/he is neither constrained nor forced by extralinguistic factors to
 make any particular choice. In other words, the categories given and new are not
 pregrammatical or prelinguistic, as has been suggested by writers such as Heath
 (1984:606); and furthermore, it is not possible to say on the basis of an
 inspection of the linguistic and extralinguistic context that a particular item is
 either given or new. There is at best a correlation between the linguistic
 categories and the extralinguistic ones, whereby they agree in the majority of
 cases. Viewing given and new as pre- or extra-linguistic, linguists have been
 forced to conclude that they have no fixed realisation in grammar. By taking the
 view advocated in systemic functional grammar, it is clear that there is a direct
 relationship between form and meaning - although not between form and
 reference. To exemplify this discussion, consider an extract from Text 1 (line
 (5)), repeated here as example (5-213).
      (5-213) moongaya I milawawinmi           bidi -yooddoo -ngga I
              morning       they:were:looking they dual           ERG
              1n the morning, they two were looking (at the fishing lines).'
Given the textual context of its occurrence, it would be natural for the speaker to
presume that the hearer is able to identify the two individuals referred to by
bidiyooddoongga 'by they two', and even that they were in the forefront of the
hearer's consciousness. But to claim that this phrase is therefore given is to miss
the point; there is no reason for a hearer to suppose that only the two individuals
                 11ffi TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF 11ffi CLAUSE                      367other than the speaker went to look at the fishing lines in the morning. This is
the reason why the speaker chose to represent bidiyooddoongga 'by they two' as
new and focal information. Thus, only by maintaining the distinction between
linguistic meaning and reference (or core and contextual meaning) can significant
generalisations be made.
       The salient syllable most frequently falls on one of the stressed syllables of
the final clausal IC (phrase, adverbial or particle) in the tone unit An exception
to this generalisation concerns the group of clauses which I have referred to as
situations of being (see section 5.2.1.2). These are clauses which have one of
the three stance verbs bagi- 'lie', warang- 'sit' and wara- 'stand', and assert either
the existence of an entity, an attribute of an entity, or a niche the entity
inhabits. In these clauses, the VP always comes finally in the tone unit to
which it belongs, and is never salient. Any stressed syllable within the salient
phrase may have the main stress, although there may be a tendency for the main
stress to fall on the main lexical item in the IC. Salience placement is probably
semantically conditioned: apparently in NPs it identifies phrase level focus, that
is, the item evaluated as the most newsworthy item of the phrase.
      It follows from the preceding paragraph that the information Focus usually
falls on the final IC in an information unit This is, however, a tendency, and
not a grammatical rule. Any distributional word in the information unit,
regardless of its position, may be focal. It is hypothesised that the UNMARKED
place for information Focus is on the final IC in the information unit. This
placement is unmarked in respect that the preceding material in the information
unit may be either given or new. An information unit with final Focus may
thus occur in any of the three logically possible circumstances, where the
preceding material is given, new, or some given and some new. The Focus is
MARKED when it occurs on a non-final constituent Here again, the preceding
material may be either given, new, or some given and some new. But the
material following the Focus is positively specified as given or retrievable. That
is, the Focus falls on a non-final constituent only under the condition that the
material following it is given. Conversely, placement of given information
following new information may be presumed to be a marked order.
      A number of observations support this claim.
      (1) Contrastive focus normally falls on a non-final constituent. For
example,
     (5-214) nginyji lililoowa wardbiri I nganyi nginulangaddi
             you     westside you'll:go I        this:way
368                               THE CLAUSE              wardjawingi I
              I'll: go
              'You go the west way, I'll go this way.'
      (5-215) ngidi gadjinmarni I       nganyi babooddoonggoo wardngi I
              \\e   we:left:each:other I       downwards      I:went
              niyi thaanoonggoo wardji I
              he up                  he:went
              'We split up; I went down, he went up.'
As is well known (see for example Chafe 1976:33-34}, a contrastive clause
normally involves a presupposition that the situation obtained for someone,
something, or in certain circumstances, or that a certain individual (or time,
place, etc.) was involved in some situation or other. (5-214) is a direct quote and
comes from a text in which a head police tracker is giving instructions to
another tracker. It is reasonable to assume that there is a presupposition that
each would go in some direction.
      (5-214) and (5-215) show that the presupposed material (or a linguistic
expression representing it in whole or part) follows the Focus. What is
presupposed is of course given, and is explicitly marked as such by its
placement after the Focus. On the other hand, being given, presupposed material
is likely to be ellipsed, resulting in a construction with unmarked Focus- see
line (41) of Text 1.
      (2) The placement of the propositional modifiers mangaddi 'no, not',
yiganyi 'uncertain', thaddi 'mistakenly believed', etc., conftrm the above pattern.
Immediately following non-final foci are contrastive. Consider example (5-216},
which comes from a text concerning a man who got lost in the desert. The
immediately preceding text had described him starting on his way back home.
Thus it is presupposed that he was returning home, and the material following
the Focus, wardji riwiyidda 'he went to his camp', constitutes given information.
The adverbial thiddgirli 'straight' is thus a point of contrastive focus, contrasting
with the Focus of the following information unit, ngilayani ngiwayinyali 'east
and south again'.
      (5-216) mangaddi thiddgirli wardji        riwiyidda I ngiwayi wardji
               not         straight     he:went to:camp      south      he:went
               ngilayani ngiwayi -nyali wardji I
               east         south      again he:went
               'He didn't go straight to his camp; he went south, east, then south
                  again.'
                THE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE                         369      (3) Gooniyandi does not distinguish declarative from interrogative moods,
either formally by morphology or syntax, or, as far as I can tell, prosodically.
Information requests are made indirectly by statements offering some
information, but leaving something indefinite (cf. Eades 1982). In this way, the
speaker may hope to elicit a response filling in the indefmite blank. Information
requests use the indefinite determinersjaji 'something', ngoorndoo 'someone' and
ngoonyoo 'something', as well as the adverbials yiniga 'somehow' and
yaningimi (morphologically 'now-indefinite') 'sometime'. These indefinite words
are always the information Focus in information requests - but not all
utterances in which they are focal are questions, or construed as questions. The
reason for this is obvious: the speaker would quite naturally single out and draw
attention to the indefinite or unknown part of his utterance, the part s/he seeks
elaboration of or comment on, as the most newsworthy. In addition, the
indefinite word is typically non-final (unless it is the only element in the unit),
and a marked information Focus. (5-217) is an example:
     (5-217) ngoorndoo -ngga ngaaddi widdbginyja I
             someone     ERG stone        you:throw:it
             'Who are you throwing stones.'
      The explanation for the fact that the indefinite word is a marked Focus is
that questions are pragmatically marked (see Goody 1978), and typically involve
a presupposition that the predication holds true for at least one entity, place,
time, etc .. And this presupposition may be treated as given information. For
(5-217), the action was of course situationally obvious.
I remark that in ''rhetorical questions'"" - that is, utterances which look like
questions but which are not used to elicit infonnation, and for which straight
linguistic responses would be judged inadequate - the indefinite word is not
nonnally focal. The Focus is unmarked, and falls on the VP in (5-218), which is a
quoted utterance of a white head stockman to his Aboriginal workers questioning
their action of cutting a bullock skin which he had explicitly instructed them not
to do. Presumably he was not merely seeking infonnation.
      (5-218) jaji         -yoo gajgilanggidda I
               something DAT you:plural:have:cut:it
               'Why have you cut it?'
In a similar way, when the indefmite word is followed by either -widdi UNKN or
-ngaddaya TOO, there is not usually any presupposition involved. And the
indefinite word, or the distributional word it forms a part of, does not nonnally
constitute a marked Focus. These observations are exemplified in (5-219), which
shows that the resulting utterance closely approximates clauses with indefinites in
English:
370                               THE ClAUSE
      (5-219) ngoorndoo -ga    -widdi   moownga -nganggi I
              someone    ERG UNKN he:looked for:you
              'Someone was looking for you.'
      The main deviation from the pattern described here concerns the indefinite
yiniga 'somehow', when it realises the role of Process in a VP (in which case it
has the sense 'do something'), In about a quarter of the available examples, all of
which are elicited, the verbal complex occurs finally and is focal. The problem
here is that the presupposition that something happened is realised linguistically
by the same item that realises the information Focus. The presupposition
therefore can't be set off as given information. What happens in most cases is
that the focal verbal complex is followed by an NP or PP. This phrase
represents given information, the connection between its referent and its
experiential role in the clause. This is the closest possible linguistic
approximation to the presupposition. (5-220) is a typical example.
      (5-220) yinigawinmi         yoowooloo       garndiwangooddoo I
              they:did:something man              many
              What did all those men do?'
      This discussion of information requests may be generalised to questions in
general. In Gooniyandi, requests of confirmation or disconfirmation (polar
yes/no questions) are expressed by the assertion of a proposition, with the
intention and expectation that the hearer's agreement or disagreement will be
elicited. One pan of the proposition, namely the part about which the speaker is
least certain, is selected as the information Focus. The enclitic -mi - -ma IND.
which indicates roughly the same type of indefiniteness as the indefinite
determiners and adverbs, is usually added to the word on which information
Focus falls. Not unusually, especially when it falls on a non-verbal constituent,
the information Focus is marked and there is a presupposition that the process
did occur for at least some entity, place, time, or whatever. A's initial utterance
in (5-221}, for example, presupposes that the person in question did arrive
sometime.
      (5-221) A: gaddwaroo bijngarni I
                 afternoon    he:emerged
              B: marlami I jamoondoo bijngarni I
                 nothing      other:day     he:emerged
              A: 'Did he come yesterday?'
              B: 'No, he came the other day.'
It may be thought that an interrogative mood might be defmed by the placement
                TilE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF TilE CLAUSE                     371of information Focus on the indefmite word in the case of information requests,
and on the word to which -mi - -ma IND is attached in the case of requests of
confirmation. However, this will not work since the Focus can fall on these items
without any suggestion that information or confirmation is being sought - see
line (12) of Text 2, for example.
      To summarise, Gooniyandi discourse is spoken as a sequence of tone units,
which define information units, each of which carries a single unit of
information. Information units always contain a Focus, which carries the most
newsworthy item. It may optionally have material preceding the Focus, which
may be either given or new or some given and some new; and it may optionally
have material following the Focus, which is given. The information unit thus
has the structure shown below:
     (5-222) (unmarked given/new)""Focus""(+given)
As we have seen, the final [+given] material represents a presupposed
proposition, either in whole or in part.","[349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 355]"
"    3.2 Parts-of-speech
    In this section I suggest a classification of the parts-of-speech in Gooniyandi,
    embracing all words and morphemes.l The entities I want to classify are the    1 In including both words and morphemes in this classification I am going
    against the usual practice of grammarians, who normally include only words, and
    not morphemes, in their parts-of-speech classification. There seems to be no
                                 1HEWORD
136
lexical items themselves (see above). abstracted from all context; I do not aim to
classify the g-words and morphemes, the units of the rank scale. A classification
of the lexemes will provide more information than would a classification of the
contextualised units, and it is mainly for this reason that I undertake the former
enterprise.
     The major difficulty in assigning Gooniyandi lexical words and morphemes
to classes is their multifunctionality: most occur in a number of distinct
syntagmatic environments. A form such as yoowooloo 'man', for example,
occurs in at least the following five contexts:
      (3-6) NP[ngirndaji yoowooloo ]NP
               this        man
            'this man'
      (3-7) pp[ngidi -yooddDo    yoowooloo]pp
               we(R) DU           man
            'we two men'
      (3-8} yp[yoowooloo -windz]yp
              man         he:becarne
            'He became a man.'
      (3-9) K[yoowooloo lK
              man
            'Man!'
      (3-10) N[yoowooloo -mili]N
               man           CHAR
             'man-crazy'
      But there are, however, a number of reasons which suggest that yoowooloo
'man' is a single lexeme uniquely assignable to the class nominal. Firstly, the
commonalty of meaning through the examples suggests that there is a single
morpheme yoowooloo 'man' throughout (3-6) to (3-10); what differences there
are are fairly obviously attributable to the different grammatical environments.
Secondly, a sizeable class of words, all of which are notionally nouns, appear toconvincing reason for this restriction, and since I will be later making use of
various more general labels for morphemes (labels such as nominal suffix), I have
felt that a complete classification would be advantageous at this point to the
reader, and that this small departure from tradition would thus be justified. It is
also for this reason that I have eschewed the term 'word class', and used the more
traditional label 'part-of-speech'.
                                                                                       ···
                                PARTS-OF-SPEECH                                137be able to occur in most of the environments in which yoowooloo 'man' occurs,
and certainly always in the first two. Restrictions are generally attributable to
semantic and cultural factors. For example, many words that are notionally
nouns have not been encountered in contexts like (3-9); the reason for this is
obvious: people don't normally address ants, water, trees, etc.. But these are
semantic (or pragmatic), and not grammatical restrictions, and it is easy to
invent contexts in which addressing ants or trees would not seem too unnatural
-in fact, I have a short piece of text in which the speaker addresses a particular
tree of mythical significance. On the other hand, there are lexical roots that occur
only in a subset of these environments, not including the first two, and yet other
lexemes occurring in complementary environments. Thus, even though lexemes
are multifunctional, it is possible to identify classes by occurrence in common
ranges of syntagmatic environments.
      In these respects Gooniyandi would appear to be intermediate between
English and what is reportedly the norm for Australian languages. According to
Dixon (1980:271), in the majority of Australian languages lexical roots belong           i
to disjoint classes which are defined by occurrence in specified syntagmatic
environments. In Gooniyandi, classes defined in this way overlap considerably:          II
as in English, as we have seen, a single word-form can usually occur in a variety
of syntagmatic contexts. But Gooniyandi is unlike English which has a large             !t
number of pairs like dog (noun) vs. dog (verb), bottle (noun) vs. bottle (verb),        ~
etc., where the meaning differences are not fully predictable, thus making it
necessary for the dictionary maker to provide separate definitions for each distinct
context of occurrence. In Gooniyandi the differences of meaning are as a rule
completely predictable, and one dictionary definition will suffice.
      This is not to deny the existence of homophony in Gooniyandi. As far as I
have been able to determine, however, there are very few homophones. The only
convincing examples I have been able to find are doowa 'store' and doowa 'he
gets it'; and nginyji 'you', nginyji 'certainly, indeed' and -nginyji, a form of the
classifier +DI which refers to the action of a first person singular agent on a
second person singular patient (see below section 3.9.3.2).
      Most examples which at first appear to be homophones turn out on closer
examination to be single lexemes whose variant senses can be explained as
contextualisations of a single basic meaning. Consider, for example, widdij-
which translates both 'dig (a hole)' and 'scratch'; yiniga which translates as both
'how, in what manner' and 'say or do something'; miga which translates 'that
way' and 'tell, say, think'; and yiganyi which corresponds sometimes to 'maybe,
perhaps' and sometimes to 'sneakingly'. For each of these four phonemic forms I
138                                  THE WORDhave given two or three approximate English glosses. based on the native
speakers' glosses in various examples. Across a large number of examples
(consisting of Gooniyandi-English translation ""equivalents"") the glosses given
for the words fall into the two or three distinct English expressions as indicated
above. It seems likely, however, that these senses are not as unrelated as the
glosses would immediately suggest to the English speaker, and that each form is
a single Iexeme having a single basic meaning. Very approximately, widdij-
means 'scrape a surface with a relatively sharp or elongated instrument'; yiniga
means 'what or some manner of action'; miga means 'this manner of action'; and
yiganyi means 'uncertain, unsure' (where cultural factors determine what
constitutes lack of assurance).
      The major parts-of-speech in Gooniyandi are set out in Table 3-1 below.
Each lexical word/morpheme can be uniquely assigned to a class.","[120, 121, 122, 123]"
"4 This is interesting since a classificatory MM is a possible third choice of
spouse in some tribes with subsections, including the neighbouring Jaru (Tsunoda
1981:10) and Walmajarri (Kaberry 1939:46,119). Kolig (1981:100) mentions that
8% of the marriages he recorded in the Fitzroy Crossing region were of this type,
and that some individuals insisted on the legality of such unions. This joking
insult is, however, the only evidence I have at all suggestive of the acceptability
of the jaja 'mother's mother' union amongst the Gooniyandi people.
18                             INTRODUCI10N       Unlike its counterpart in Dyirbal, Dyalnguy (Dixon 1972:32), the
Gooniyandi avoidance style is not a fully distinct and separate language, with its
own vocabulary. Nor is it obligatorily and mechanically chosen in response to a
fully predetermined interaction type. As Rumsey (1982a:160) has poin:ed o~t,
the use of the style is ""a part of the means for CONSTITUTING the relationship
between the interactants as one of 'avoidance' or potential affinehood"" (his
emphasis). The avoidance style is characterised by a cluster of formal features
and strategies of language use which distinguish it from other Gooniyandi styles
of speech, and which may be found to varying degrees in actual utterances.
Different degrees of avoidance can thus be 'marked' or 'indicated' by varying
usage of avoidance features (see below).
       In formal terms, the avoidance style differs somewhat in lexicon, but has
 the same bound morphemes as ordinary Gooniyandi. There are over one hundred
distinct avoidance Iexemes; these tend to be longer than ordinary words, and to
exhibit a higher frequency of heterogeneous consonant clusters than is found in
ordinary words. Not every ordinary word has a distinct avoidance counterpart,
 however. Some gaps, such as the absence of terms for sexual organs and acts are
expected; others are not- for example, despite intensive questioning, I was able
to find a distinct term for only one animal, the dog. (I have been unable to
discern general principles characterising the lexical range of the avoidance
vocabulary.)
       Avoidance words in Australian languages tend to be more general than their
everyday counterparts (Dixon 1972, Haviland 1978, Rumsey 1982a). In
Gooniyandi it is primarily the verbal roots of the avoidance style that are more
general than their ordinary counterparts. For instance, gamalg- 'say, tell, speak,
etc.' has a range of meanings that is covered by a number of more specific
everyday terms, including jag- 'say', jijag- 'speak', miga- 'tell', etc. Avoidance
verb roots typically occur with a larger range of classifiers (see section 3.9.3.2)
than do ordinary verbs, and in this way some, though certainly not all, of the
lexical ambiguity may be resolved. The avoidance verb root gamalg-, for
example, occurs with the classifier +MI 'effect' to convey the sense 'tell, say';
with +DI 'catch' to convey the sense 'put a question'; and with +I 'be, go' to
convey the sense 'speak, talk'. On the other hand, jag- occurs with only the
classifier +MI, jijag- with only +I, and mig a- with only +MI and +I. In this
respect the Gooniyandi avoidance style contrasts sharply with the Bunuba one
whic.h.has a particular auxiliary verb (see page 6 above, and Rumsey I982a: 167)
spe~tftc to th~ ~tyle .. In the Bunuba system, the choice of auxiliary verb is not
available to dtstmgmsh among the senses of a lexical verb root.
                                  SPEECH STYLES                                    19       Nominal roots generally have the same meaning as their everyday
 counterparts. For example, the avoidance nominal ngarloomaii 'spear'
 corresponds to the ordinary generic term for spear,jinali, including in its range
precisely the same subtypes. On those occasions when I requested an avoidance
equivalent for a more specific type of spear, I was invariably given the ordinary
 term. The response was invariably the same when I requested other specific
 terms, and I could detect no tendency to extend the range of an avoidance
nominal beyond the range of its corresponding ordinary term. It thus appears that
avoidance nominals have exact, or nearly exact, ordinary equivalents, and can not
be used to effect higher order taxonomic groupings than those which are a1rcady
made in the ordinary language (cf. Dixon 1972:292ff).
      A few closed class grammatical items also have distinct avoidance terms.
For example, there is a particle woomoorla 'no, not, nothing, without', which
corresponds to the particle mar/ami 'not, nothing, without' of the everyday style,
and perhaps also to mangaddi 'no, not' (sec page 496 below); there is also a
nominal yawinhingi 'some, other' corresponding to the everyday terms yaanya
'other' and yaabja 'some'. At least in the latter instance, a distinction made in the
everyday vocabulary is neutralised in the avoidance vocabulary.
      It will come a<> no surprise that in Gooniyandi avoidance speech, as in the
Bunuba variety (Rumsey 1982a), not every word in an utterance need be- or
even could be - an avoidance word. Often only a single word in an utterance
marks it as avoidance speech, whether or not other ordinary words COULD BE
replaced by avoidance terms. Indeed, a single feature, such as use of a non·
singular free pronoun, pronominal enclitic or prefix wit11 singular reference, may
even suffice.
      Strategies of language use differ between avoidance spct>.Ch and everyday
speech. There are differences in: (I) modes of address and reference; (2) frequency
of propositional modification; and (3) degree of precision of expression.
      (1) A man was of course not supposed to address his actual WM; nor could
he utter her name, or a close homonym. Reference to her could be oblique (e.g.
by using the term moonga 'dark'}, by use of a marked or triangular kin-tenn (e.g.
manaroo '(your) mother', speaking toW or WB), or by use of the third person
non-singular pronominal bidi 'they'. Other maddiyali, with whom speech was
permitted, were addressed with the second person non-singular pronominal gidi,
instead of the singular form nginyji. S/he would be referred to by means of the
third person plural bidi if the relationship was a close one, but otherwise more
frequently by the singular niyi; and the first person unrestricted yaadi 'we three or
more inclusive' would be used instead of ngidi 'we two, we exclusive' (see

 ordinary speech (Rumsey 1982a:l73, McConvell 1982:97), and this vagueness
 is iconic of the relation of avoidance or lack of intimacy which it t~nccxles.
 Although an avoidance verb is typically vaguer than an ordinary one, much of
 the potential ambiguity is resolved once the context is ta.ken into account. For
 example, in

             make he:effected:it hole
             'He dug a hole.'
it is quite clear that the intended sense of malab- 'make, construct' is 'dig'. It
should be noted that potential ambiguities are rarely if ever rcsolvctl by
paraphrase in actual texts (cf. Dixon 1972:293). And I suspect that this is partly
because in real terms the ambiguity of a contextualised utterance is usually
relatively small, and far less than the potential ambiguity, and partly because
vagueness is an inherent semantic characteristic, and not just a formal fc.altlrc of
the avoidance style.","[30, 31, 32, 33]"

382                                THE CLAUSE5.4 Remarks on the interpersonal organisation of the clause
5.4.1 Propositional modification
 A third aspect of the organisation of the clause is its organisation as an
 interactive event, involving the interlocutors in the speech situation. In an
 interactive event a clause may be used either: (a) to exchange information, or (b)
 exchange 'goods and services' (Halliday 1985:68). (This is something of an
 oversimplification, although it is useful as an initial hypothesis - see
 McGregor 1988c.) Gooniyandi does not distinguish formally between these two
 types of act There is no distinct imperative or any other such related category,
 either within the verb phrase or within the clause: e.g. a clause in the future
 tense may be used in either way, to exchange information, or to exchange 'goods
 and services' (see section 6.5.1 below, and cf. Halliday 1985:68).
       Simultaneously, the clause may be used in: (i) giving or offering, and (ii)
requesting or demanding. Again these are not distinguished formally in
Gooniyandi. For example, there is no grammatically distinct class of questions
 (as has been mentioned already- see section 5.3.1). Exactly the same forms are
used in eliciting information as in giving information. As we have seen, the
enclitic -mi - -ma (see section 6.3.8) which is frequently found in requests of
confrrmation (i.e. 'yes' or 'no'), and the words ngoonyoo 'something (from a
closed set of options', ngoorndoo 'something', etc. (see 3.3.1.2) frequently found
in information requests (where they mean, respectively 'which' and 'who'), really
mark indefiniteness (cf. Dixon 1977:182ft).
       That aspect of the meaning of a clause which remains constant across all of
these functions will be referred to as the PROPOSITIONAL CONTENT of the
clause.
       In its role in the exchange of information, the propositional content of a
clause is ASSERTED by the speaker. In the case of requests of information (i.e.
corresponding to WH-questions in English) the propositional content involves
an indefinite in the place of the information requested (cf. pages 369-370 above).
That is, the propositional content of the information request (5-240) above,
jajiwami ngabbiddayi ginharndiyiddingga 'What is it that that pair have eaten?' is
'That pair have eaten something.'
       In the case of requests of confirmation, as has already been suggested, the
speaker makes an assertion in the hope that the hearer will respond to it, either
confrrming or denying it. (This may be a reflex of the culturally appropriate
mode of information seeking - including confirmation seeking - which
involves at least the pretence of offering something for comment, elaboration,
etc., rather than direct probing - cf. Eades 1982, McGregor 1988c.) The
               INTERPERSONAL ORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE                          383propositional content of the clause may include the element 'indefinite'. Thus,
ward-ma-wiri (go-IND-you:will:go) has a propositional content 'You are going
(or doing something else)'. This assertion invites a response from the hearer. It
is for this reason that I refer to clauses used in the function of exchange of
infonnation as ASSERTIONS.
It should be noted carefully that I am not suggesting that Gooniyandi people do
not ask questions. This is quite false (for further discussion of this point, see
McGregor 1988c). What I am saying is that grammatically there is no distinct
category of questions; the same forms that are used in making statements are also
used in asking questions. This fact itself may lend some support to Eades'
suggestions as to the differences in the way in which Aboriginal and European
cultures exchange (and view) information. The lack of a distinct category means
that it is always possible for either the speaker or the hearer to use the hedge that
the utterance was in fact a statement pure and simple.
      A corresponding tenn for clauses used in the second major function of
exchange of goods and services is the term PROPOSAL, following Halliday
(1985:71). Here the speaker proposes, rather than asserts, the propositional
content of the clause. This proposal amounts to a suggestion that the
propositional content should be true, thereby offering his assurance that it will
be true (i.e. the speaker proposes to effect the necessary actions), or
requests/demands that the addressee make the propositional content true (by
effecting the necessary actions).
      There is another 'speech-act' type in which the clause is used neither to
convey information nor to exchange goods and services: EXCLAMATIONS.
Again, they have no distinctive formal properties, although, as for ""questions"",
there is an enclitic, namely -woo DEF which means roughly 'defmitely, exactly',
which frequently occurs in this speech act type. For examples, see section 6.3.9
and section 6.5.3.3.
      All situation and non-situation clauses may be used in the exchange of
information, i.e. in assertions. A proper subset of these may also be used in
proposals. For example, characterising and identifying relational (non-situation)
clauses do not occur as proposals, although existential clauses may - see
example (5-33) above; nor, at least in the present corpus, do situation clauses
whose VPs are in the past tense.
      From the point of view of its propositional content, a major clause
consists of an obligatory Proposition, and an optional Propositional Modifier.
The 'simple' Proposition is realised by a clause consisting of the following
types of unit: NP, PP, VP, and/or ADV. (That is, the 'simple' Proposition is
that part of the clause which in experiential tenns refers to a situation or a
384                                THE CLAUSErelationship.) Thus, for example, a 'simple' clause such as
      (5-246) nganyi -ngga manyi wanJJa
              I        ERG food I:brought:it
              'I brought food.'
consists of the Proposition nganyingga manyi wardla 'I brought food'. A
Propositional Modifier may be realised by a particle or an adverbial. A clause
such as
      (5-247) mangaddi gilbawidi        banda
              not         they:found:it dirt
              'They didn't fmd (any) dirt.'
has constituency structure
      Propositional Modifier     Proposition
      [mangaddl1                 [gilbawidi     OOnda]
      not                        they:found:it dirt
      In the identification of the two constituents, the Proposition and the
Propositional Modifier, the clause is being viewed from the perspective of its
role as an interactive event in the speech situation. That is, the Proposition and
the Propositional Modifier are interpersonal roles in the clause. This follows
from the fact that the propositional content of the clause is that which
contextualises as an assertion, a proposal, or an exclamation, within the speech
situation it occurs in. It is that aspect of the meaning of the clause exchanged
between the speaker and the hearer. The role of Propositional Modifier is thus a
modal one, indicating some sort of qualification of the Proposition.
      There appear to be three main ways in which the proposition expressed by
a clause may be modified: (a) objective, in which the 'logical' status of the
proposition is modified; (b) subjective, in which the speaker's attitude towards
the logical status of the proposition is indicated; and (c) expectation
modification, in which the proposition is placed within the expectations of the
interlocutors. Table 5-1 sets out the main lexemes functioning in these three
types of propositional modification.
              INTERPERSONAL ORGANISATION OF THE ClAUSE                      385                      Table 5-1: Propositional ModifiersObjective       Polarity:    mangaddi 'no', marlami 'nothing', woomoorla 'no'

                Probability: birli 'maybe'

                           'nearly, almost', yilba 'completely', yaningi 'right
                           now', yaniyaningi 'already'
                Frequency: ngaddarni 'always'(Note: the glosses given in the table are very approximate, and suitable to the
context in which the words are used as Propositional Modifiers. These words
may have other apparently quite distinct meanings in other contexts. See section
6.4 for a detailed discussion of the significance of the terms.)
Clearly most of the words in Table 5-l do not have modal-type meanings. Rather,
what is being claimed is that they may play modal roles in the clauses in which
they occur.
      The lexemes under Expectation require some comment. Scalar is used
following McConvell (1983a) in reference to the situation in which the expected
is ranked with respect to the asserted. For example, in
      (5-248) winhi danymiliyidda mangaddi milayidda
              just     we:heard:it      not          we:saw:it
               'We only heard it, we didn't see it.'
the asserted p:roposition, that we heard it, is ranked lower than the expectation
that we should have seen it. (For further discussion see below sections 6.3.3,
6.3.5, 6.4.7, and 6.4.8.)
     The temporal adverbials are not only used in locating processes in time-
although this might be seen as their unmarked function - but they are also used
in modifying propositions with respect to expectations. For example, ngamoo
'before' normally occurs in contrast with other time expressions such as
gaddwaroo 'afternoon, yesterday', e.g. in ""frames"" such as:
386                                 THE CLAUSE      (5-249)       ngamoo               gaddigmi
                    before               it:fmished
                    gaddwaroo
                    afternoon
                    jamoondoo
                    other.day
                '(The rain) fmished before/yesterday/the other day.'
Such sentences constitute plain responses to information requests such as
yaningimi gaddigmi 'When did it finish?' (='It finished sometime'). It is
presupposed that 'the rain stopped sometime'. However, ngamoo before' may
also occur in a contrasting set with mangaddi 'no, not', yiganyi 'uncertain', etc.:
      (5-250)       ngamoo         gaddigmi
                    before         it: finished
                    mangaddi
                    not
                    yiganyi
                    uncertain
                '(The rain) has already/not/perhaps finished.'
In this case, these sentences are not plain responses to information requests (i.e.
When did it happen?'). Rather, they are appropriate to a context in which the
status of the Proposition expressed by gaddigmi - '(the rain) has fmished' - is
called to question for some reason. The clause ngamoo gaddigmi (example
(5-250)) occurred in such a situation. The speaker had asserted his belief that the
rain would stop sometime later on in the day. However, on going outside, he
found that it had already stopped raining, upon which he uttered the clause. The
point of the utterance was not to indicate WHEN the rain had stopped, but rather
that it had ALREADY stopped. The first embodies a presupposition that the rain
had already stopped, which was certainly not the case when this clause was
uttered. The presupposition was the negation of this, that the rain had not (yet)
ceased.
      The remaining lexeme (see Table 5-1), which I have labeled as a frequency
adverbial, occurs when there is some expectation to the contrary, i.e. an
expectation that the situation does not always occur. Otherwise, in the absence
of such expectations, it would not be used; instead, a more neutral mode of
expression (involving present tense in the VP) would be used- see below
section 6.5.1.2.
                1NTERPERSONALORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE                         387      Temporal adverbials are not the only lexemes which may realise both an
experiential role (of temporal location) and an interpersonal role (of
Propositional Modifier). The same holds true of the lexemes listed under
subjective modification: each of these may realise an interpersonal role,
indicating the speaker's attitude towards the proposition, and an experiential role
of Manner, indicating the Actor's subjective state as s/he engages in the action
(e.g. 'think mistakenly', 'go uncertainly', 'think/talk correctly or truly' - see
discussion of these terms in section 6.4).
      The lexeme that realises the role of Propositional Modifier enters into a
syntagmatic relation with a full clause: it has a single full clause and no more
(and no less) in its scope. It is not surprising then that a Propositional Modifier
may have within its scope a 'complex' (or non-simple) Proposition- that is,
one which is itself a modified Proposition. For example,      (5-251)     ngaddarni       mangaddi           bijbiyaniila goomboorna
                  always          not                I: come        early                                Propositional

                  Propositional Modifier
                  Modifier
                                                    Proposition                  'I never come (here) early.'      (5-252)     wamba -nyali      mangaddi            bijgoowarni
                  still    REP      not                 it: is: emerging                                    Propositional       Proposition
                  Propositional     Modifier
                  Modifier
                                                 Proposition                  '(The sand) is still not coming out (of the receding flood-
                     waters).'
     The order of Propositional Modifiers is significant. The first always
includes the second within its scope, as is the case for all other such 'form'
markers, postpositions and enclitics. Thus, in (5-251) and (5-252) it is the
negated proposition that is asserted as always holding, and still holding true.
These lexemes never form syntagms together.
388                                THE CLAUSE      As elsewhere, the maximum observed depth of embedding is two, and no
clause in the corpus contains more than two Propositional Modifiers. Of the
lexical items that can independently realise the role of Propositional Modifier,
only a very few have actually been observed in combination. In all available
examples, the innermost Propositional Modifier role is realised by mangaddi 'no,
not' (cf. below section 6.4.1).
      The position of the Propositional Modifier in the clause is not fixed. It is
largely dependent on interpersonal and textual considerations- principally the
presuppositions of the interlocutors, and thematisation. Before discussing these,
I briefly mention two general tendencies in placement of Propositional
Modifiers. (The following examples all involve the particle mangaddi 'no, not',
the most frequently occurring Propositional Modifier. Similar examples can be
found for other Propositional Modifiers.)
      In relational clauses (see section 5.2.1.1.1) the Propositional Modifier
precedes, usually immediately, the Attribute or the Identifier. In situation clauses
it invariably precedes the VP, again frequently immediately, except in attributive
being situations. In the latter class of clauses, the Propositional Modifier
precedes, usually immediately, the Attribute, unless the Attribute follows the
VP. Some illustrative examples are:
      (5-253) mangaddi gilbawidi        balW
              not        they:found:it dirt
              'They didn't find (any) dirt'
      (5-254) nganyi mangaddi ngaanggi ngoombarna
              I        not       yours husband
              'I'm not your husband.'
      (5-255) nganyi -ngga nyamani ngabla bidi -yooddoo -ngga
              I          ERG big          I:ate:it they DU ERG
              mangaddi ngabbidda
              not          they:ate:it
              'I ate a lot, (but) they didn't eat much. t7
     Propositional Modifiers rarely occur clause finally. Some, such as
mangaddi 'no, not', thaddi 'mistakenly believed', and woomoorla 'no, not' (in the
avoidance style) never occur finally. Others, including yiganyi 'uncertain' and
some of the temporal adverbs occasionally do occur finally. Most usually when7 Note the ellipsis of the quantifier nyamani 'big, much' in the second clause of
this example. This clause did· not assert that they ate nothing.
              INTERPERSONAL ORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE                       389one of the latter lexemes occurs finally in an utterance, it is added as an
afterthought, and occurs on a separate intonation contour of its own. (It perhaps
constitutes a minor clause of the 'modifying' type - see below section 5.4.2.)
For example,
     (5-256) mooyoo bagi -ma -yi          I yiganyi I
             sleep     lie    IND he:was uncertain
             'He could have slept there.'
      It is suggested that Propositional Modifiers are as a rule thematic - the
exceptions being the few occasions in which the Propositional Modifier occurs
clause finally. Since they express the speaker's angle on the proposition, they
are natural points of departure for the utterance (cf. Halliday 1985:49-50). That
is, for example, mangaddi 'no, not' is thematic in (5-254) and the second clause
of (5-255) even though it is not clause initial. As suggested above (section
5.3.2), in clauses having a thematic interpersonal role, one or more of the
experiential roles will also be thematic. Moreover, the order of the two Themes
was claimed to be semantically significant. It is suggested that greater
prominence is accorded to the frrst Theme in a sequence. This appears to be the
case in
     (5-257) mangaddi yangbala      -ngga goornboo doownga I
             not      young:man ERG woman          he:got:him
             'Young men didn't take wives.'
It is clear that, in the text in which (5-257) occurred, which concerned the
differences between marriage practises of pre-contact days and today, the main
Theme is the negation, not the Agents and Goals. Compare on the other hand
correlative constructions such as
     (5-258) ngooddoo milawa             nganyi mangaddi milaanawoo
             that       you:will:see:him I      not      you:see:me
             'Look at him, not at me.'
Here it would seem that the speaker is the most prominent Theme, and Focus of
contrast, in the second clause.
     I have already discussed (page 368) the circumstances in which the
Propositional Modifier is immediately followed by a focal constituent. If this
constituent is a marked Focus, the material following it embodies a
presupposition that some situation occurred, which usually differs in a single
respect - in terms of the participants, inner roles, attributes or circumstances
involved, or in terms of the process- from the situation claimed not to occur.
390                                THE CLAUSEExamples are (5-212) above and the following:
      (5-259) mangaddi nganyi -ngga gardlooni yoowooloo -ngga
              not      I       ERG I:hit:him man         ERG
              gardbiddini
              they: hit: him
              'I didn't hit him, the men did.'
      (5-260) mangaddi ngooddi -ya           yoodli     ngirndaji -ya
              not           that     LOC I:put:it       this      LOC
              yoodli
              I:put:it
              'I didn't put it down there, I put it down here.'
      (5-261) mangaddi niyaji      yoowooloo giddabingaddi
              not      this        man           tall
              garingiwa      giddabingaddi
              his:wife       tall
              'It's not this man who is tall, but his wife.'
(5-259) involves a presupposition that someone hit the person under
consideration; (5-260) involves a presupposition that the speaker put the object
somewhere; and (5-261) presupposes that someone is tall.
      The above characterisation of presupposition is too constrained: there is a
greater degree of freedom in its relation to the asserted proposition. This may be
seen in the following example:
      (5-262) mangaddi niyi -ngga dijjingi    marla -ya
              not      that ERG he:snapped:it hand LOC
              moorda dijbindi        -nhi        goodij -jangga
              certainly it:snapped on:him hold           ABLz
              'He didn't break it; it really broke in his hand as he held it'
(5-262) presupposes only that the knife broke (a given in the context of
occurrence of this clause). The presupposition, that is, may be a somewhat
weaker proposition than that which is asserted.
A second possibility is that the correlated clause may involve a rather more
specific process, one which more precisely characterises the process as it applies
to the new circumstance, manner, or whatever. Thus, in (5-263), although it is
presupposed that the dead are put somewhere (a process which could be described
with the verballexeme yood- 'put'), in the correlated clause a more specific lexeme
is chosen, to refer to the placement of something within a cavity:
              1NTERPERSONAL ORGANISATION OF THE CLAUSE                         391
     (5-263) mangaddi    ganarna    -ya   yoodgoodoo banda       -ya
             not          platform LOC they:put:him ground        LOC
              diriggoodoo
              they:enter:him
              'They don't put a dead person on a burial platform; they bury him in
                 the ground.'
      Next to the correlative constructions such as (5-261) and (5-262) there is an
alternative construction, which appears to be roughly synonymous:
     (5-264) mangaddi thirirli I janggoo goorijgoodda I
             not        hard       soft   they:hold:it
             Not hard, soft they hold it'
     (5-265) A: jaji      -yoo wardja
                something DAT you:took:it
              B: mangaddi nganyi -ngga ngooddoo yaanya -ngga
                 not      I       ERG that      other ERG
                  yoowooloo wardnga
                 man            he:took:it
              A: 'Why did you take it?'
              B: 'I didn't, that other man took it.'
Probably the most reasonable way of accounting for (5-264) and (5-265) is to
assume that mangaddi thirirli 'not hard' and mangaddi nganyingga 'not by me'
respectively are elliptical clauses. These sentences would be regarded as 'reduced'
correlative constructions of the type exemplified in (5-260) to (5-262) above.
Sometimes mangaddi x (not x) follows the positive clause (instead of preceding
it), in which case it seems to be added as a type of afterthought:
       (5:266) yaningi -nyali wardbangadda                I mangaddi
               today      REP you:will:bring:it:for:me not
              moongaya I
              tomorrow
              'Bring it today, not tomorrow.'
     (5-267) ngaddagi -moowa ngoorloogla I mangaddi yaabja I
             I           ON       I:drank:it  not   others
             'I drank it alone, no one else.'","[365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372, 373, 374, 375]"
"    3.5 Particles
    Gooniyandi has a small class of a dozen or so particles, which are non-ranking d-
    words that enter into syntagmatic relations with clauses, which they contain
    within their 'scope' (see example (3-3)). As mentioned earlier, particles modify
    the propositional content of clauses (on which see also section 5.4.1 below).
    Particles may be defined as those lexemes that are also d-words, and which
    contain clauses within their scope, but do not occur in other clausal roles. The
    last qualification is necessary because there are at least three temporal adverbials
    -namely ngamoo 'before', yaningi 'now' and wamba 'later··- which can, and
    fairly commonly do, function as propositional modifiers.
          The following are the main particles:
166                                TiffiWORD              mangaddi          'not, it is not the case that'
              marlami           'nothing, nowhere, never, no one'
              briyandi          'in tum, in retaliation'
              thaaddi           'it was mistakenly believed that'
              yiganyi           'uncertain'
              win hi            'only, just, nothing of importance'
              wajanginyji       'but really, in actual fact'
              jinginyji         'but really, in actual fact'
              moorda            'completely, certainly'
              minyjidda         'true'
              birli             'maybe, perhaps'
              woomoorla         'not' (avoidance style)
              ngaddarni         'always'
              ngambiddi         'again, next time'
              wambawoo          'almost, nearly'
              yaniyaningi       'already'
      The glosses given here are to be taken with a grain of salt; for a detailed
discussion of the semantics of the particles, see section 6.4.
      Unlike nominals and adverbials, particles do not enter into syntagmatic
relations with one another to form complexes, or, as is the case for nominals,
phrase-like constructions. If a clause contains two particles, each realises a
different propositional modifying role; they never go together as a single unit
realising a role of this type. One of them is always contained within the scope
of the other, and constitutes a part of the clause within the scope of the second
(see below page 387).
      Some particles do occur elsewhere, as constituents of NPs. For example,
the 'subjective' particles thaaddi 'mistakenly believed' and yiganyi 'uncertain' can
be ""nominalised"". This involves a shift from the speaker's subjectivity to the
subjectivity of the actor in the referent situation, thus: thaaddi '(actor) believed
mistakenly' and yiganyi '(actor) was uncertain in the manner in which s/he did
the action'. In this circumstance, the particle yiganyi 'uncertain' (but not thaaddi
'mistakenly believed') occurs as the sole lexical constituent in an NP or ERG PP
(depending on whether the clause is intransitive or not) realising a circumstance
of Manner (section 5.2.3.4). The particle mar/ami 'nothing, without' also occurs
within NPs, usually as a Qualifier or Entity (see examples (6-117) and (6-127),
whilst mangaddi 'not, no' occasionally contains just a single word (or phrase)
within its scope (see example (6-113)).

                                      PRONOMINALS                                   167
     3.6 Pronominals
     The category of person is realised in a number of different places and ways in the
     grammar of Gooniyandi. Within the VP it is realised by bound morphemes,
     which occur either as prefixes to the classifier complex, or as enclitics to the
     entire verb phrase (see section 3.9.3.6). Elsewhere, it is realised by free words,
     and in a set of two possessive suffixes to kin-tenus (see section 3.12.2.1). With
     two minor exceptions (see pages 225 and 234 below) the system is constant
     throughout, distinguishing three persons (first, second and third), two numbers
     (singular and non-singular) and what I will refer to as a restricted/unrestricted
     opposition in the first person non-singular.
           The restricted category in the first person non-singular encompasses the
     traditional categories of first person dual inclusive, dual exclusive, and plural
     exclusive, whilst the unrestricted category corresponds to the first person plural
     inclusive. In other words, the inclusive/exclusive distinction is maintained only
     in the plural; it disappears in the dual. The unrestricted category always includes
     the speaker, the hearer, and at least one other person; the restricted category
     excludes one of the non-speakers. Using the symbolism S =speaker, H = hearer,
     and 0 = other(s), and assuming that S and H can refer to a single individual
     only, while 0 may refer to any number of others, the restricted and unrestricted
     categories may be distinguished as follows:
                                        s           H          0
                       Restricted       +           a          -a
                       Unrestricted     +           +          +
     where a can be either+ or-, -a having the reverse polarity. Equivalently, we
     could describe the restricted category as S & (H v 0), where 'v' signifies
     disjunctive or; and the unrestricted category as S & H & 0.
     To the best of my knowledge, pronominal systems resembling the Gooniyandi
     one have not been reported in any other language, from Australia or elsewhere.
     Among the neighbouring languages, those from the Pama-Nyungan family -
     which includes Walmajarri (Hudson 1978:85), Jaru (Tsunoda 1981:64ff), and
     Wangkajunga (my own fieldnotes)- and the Worrorran family- e.g. Ungarinyin
     (Rumsey 1982b:31) - make the usual inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first
     person non-singular. In the Jarrakan languages Kija (my fieldnotes) and
     Miriwoong (Kofod 1978:47), this distinction is at least optional. However, all of
     the languages of the Nyulnyulan family (traditionally located to the west of
     Gooniyandi and Bunuba) show a quite different system, which distinguishes four
     persons 1, 1/2, 2, and 3, and, depending on the language, two or three numbers,
     minimal, augmented and, where three numbers are distinguished, unit augmented
     (Stokes 1982:151ff).
168                                    1HEWORD      If the additional feature [+singular] is invoked, it is possible to distinguish
and characterise all of the pronominal categories, as shown in Table 3-4, which
cites the nominative forms.
          Table 3-4: Feature specification ofGooniyandi pronominals
        nganyi      ngidi      yaadi      nginyji      gidi       niyi      bidi
   s       +          +          +
   H                  a          +          +           +
   0                  -a         +                      +          +         +
   sg     (+)         (-)        (-)        (+)        (-)         +The bracketed symbols of the bottom line indicate that number specification is
redundant for the non-third person categories. However, that number is relevant
to, or inherent in, these categories is evident from the fact that when the non-
singulars occur in the Entity role in NPs, it can be, but need not necessarily be
marked more precisely by number words, or by the postpositions -yooddoo DU
and -yarndi PL.
      The feature analysis of Table 3-4 specifies each pronoun in such a way as
to distinguish it from every other pronoun, and associates with each an
underlying meaning specified in terms of features. This neatly encapsulates the
referential meaning of the two non-singular first person pronouns ngidi and
yaadi, providing a formal statement of the verbal description given earlier.
However, it should be noted that this does no more than provide a formal
summary of the earlier verbal statement. We must raise the question as to
whether the proposed analysis has any independent linguistic validity, and/or
whether any linguistic evidence might be invoked in support of it. The answer
to this would seem to be almost certainly NO: it is difficult to see how any
linguistic evidence might be relevant to the analysis. A more important problem
with the analysis, however, relates to the fact that the proposed features are
purely referential, and so cannot account for the avoidance usage of yaadi, in
place of ngidi, in reference to the speaker-hearer dyad, and of bidi 'they' in place
of niyi 'he, she, it', in reference to a single individual (see section 1.5 above).
      As an alternative means of description, we might attempt to arrange the
Gooniyandi pronouns in a two dimensional paradigmatic set of the usual sort.
Something of this sort has already been implied by my reference to yaadi and
ngidi as first person categories in opposition to one another, the former being
-
                                      PRONOMINALS                                   169
    labeled unrestricted, and the latter, restricted. This implies an arrangement of the
    pronominals as follows:
                                      sg            non-sg
                              1       nganyi        R ngidi
                                                    u yaadi
                              2       nginyji       gidi
                              3       niyi          bidi
         An alternative analysis might not take the + values for S in Table 3-4 as
    defining the category of first person, but instead distinguish yaadi from all other
    pronominals by virtue of the fact that it alone has a+ value for each of S, H and
    0. The pronominals could then be arranged as follows:
                                      sg            non-sg
                              1       nganyi        ngidi
                              2       nginyji       gidi
                              3       niyi          bidi
                              1/2/3                 yaadi
          The advantage of the paradigmatic approach is that it does not use strictly
    referential features, and so does not suffer from the problems in avoidance usage,
    inherent in the earlier analysis. However, there seem to be no strong arguments
    for one paradigmatic arrangement over the other (see also McGregor forth-
    coming-c), and I have arbitrarily chosen to view yaadi as a first person form.
          It will be clear that at least three individuals must be included in the
    referent set of yaadi 'we unrestricted'. I have heard only the plural marker -yarndi
    in construction with yaadi 'we unrestricted' in natural and elicited Gooniyandi
    speech. However, when I constructed the d-word yaadi-yooddoo (first person
    unrestricted-DU), it was not rejected outright, but speakers suggested that it
    might refer to just three of us, the speaker, the hearer, and one other person.
    (Alan Rumsey elicited a similar response to the corresponding constructed form
    in Bunuba (pers.comm.).) This might be taken to suggest that -yooddoo marks
    'plus one' or unit augmented (McKay 1978) rather than 'dual', were it not for the
    fact that speakers themselves frequently use yaadi-yarndi (first person
    unrestricted-PL) in reference to this particular group of three.
          I have already mentioned (section 1.5 and immediately above) shifts in the
    pronominal categories in avoidance contexts, whereby non-singular forms are
    used in reference to and in addressing a single avoidance kinsman. Reference to
    the speaker and a single hearer (where the two are in an avoidance relation to one
170                                THE WORDanother) is by means of the unrestricted yaadi, instead of the usual and predicted
restricted ngidi. One might predict that in such circumstances the dual
postposition could be used to mark the number: i.e. yaadi-yooddoo (we
unrestricted-DU) in reference to an S and a H in an avoidance relation. There are,
however, no supporting examples for this possibility.
      Corresponding to each person-number combination distinguished in the
language, there are three distinct free-standing pronouns, which I will regard as
alternate forms of a single lexeme. I will refer to the forms as nominative,
oblique and emphatic; they are tabulated in Table 3-5.
                      Table 3-5: Gooniyandi pronominals

the forms shown in the table above.
      The emphatic forms are obviously based on the corresponding oblique
forms: a segment -jinga is added to a truncated version of the oblique
pronominal. For the non-singulars, the final vowel is deleted; for the singulars,
the final vowel and preceding consonant are deleted; and for the third person
singular, the velar nasal is inserted preceding -jinga.
      Secondly, the non-singulars show d in the second syllable of the4 Although the third person singular nominative form is homophonous with the
determiner niyi 'that' (see 3.3.1.1), that they are indeed two distinct words is
evident from the fact that the latter does not have a distinct oblique form
nhoowoo, as does the pronominal; nor does it contrast with the non-singular
pronominal bidi 'they'.

                                     PRONO.MJNALS                                 171    nominative forms, and dd in the corresponding position in the oblique forms.
    This d - dd could be identified as a plural marker. This suggests that we might
    identify the following non-singular 'roots':
                                       (IR)    ngi-
                                       (lU)    ya(a)-

                                  (3non-sg)    bi-
    (See also below page 212.) The final i in the nominative forms might be
    regarded as epenthetic (as mentioned in section 2.2.5 above, i is the unmarked
    vowel word finally), inserted so as to give the word an acceptable phonological
    shape (see page 90 above). The oblique pronominal involves in each case -angi
    following the number marker. In view of the shape of the corresponding
    emphatic pronominals, this might be segmented into an oblique suffix -ang and
    an epenthetic i (which functions to give the word a normal phonological shape).
    The construction of the singular pronouns is not so regular, and it is not
    possible to segment the nominative and oblique pronouns into recurrent forms.
    The segmentation of the non-singular forms is suggested more as a possible
    historical derivation of the forms than as a synchronic morphemic analysis. Two
    of the recurrent forms (d- dd and -ang(i)) are phonotactically unusual for
    morphemes (these phonotactic patterns are otherwise restricted to a few verbal       ;,    morphemes), and the forms themselves do not occur outside of the pronominal
    paradigm.
          The choice between nominative and oblique forms depends on the
    environment in which the word occurs. The forms are in complementary
    distribution. The nominative is the form that occurs in the role of Entity in NPs
    (see section 4.1.2), except when it (i.e. the nominative form) would be directly
    followed by a case-marking postposition other than -ngga ERG (see next
    section). The oblique form is found in all other contexts within NPs. It typically
    realises either the Deictic or Qualifier (see section 4.1.2), in which case it
    indicates possession, both alienable (including 'temporary access' possession, as
    in (3-74)) and inalienable:

The expected forms nganyi-yidda (I-ALL) and nganyi-yoo (1-DAT) do not occur.
However, this is the only context in which the oblique form may realise the
Entity function. If there is an intervening morpheme, such as a number marking
postposition, the nominative form occurs:

     Finally, the oblique form is found in what would appear to be a type of
circumstance, indicating that the Actor did the process alone, or by him/herself.
The clause may be transitive, intransitive, or reflexive/reciprocal.

     If the pronominals in (3-78) and (3-80) were NP constituents it would be
expected that they might occur in construction with postpositions, indicating
their role in the clause. However, they never do (in the available examples), and
moreover they contrast with PPs such as yoowarni-ngga (one-ERG) 'by one' in
(3-81). Contrast this with (3-78) above.

     In this respect the oblique forms resemble adverbials, and an alternative
(perhaps equally valid) parts-of-speech classification might place the nominative
pronominals in the class on nominals, and the oblique and emphatic
pronominals in the adverbial class.
     The forms I have labeled emphatic are used very similarly to the 'adverbial'
function of the oblique just discussed, but seem to be somewhat stronger,
indicating that not only did the Actor act alone, or as a unified group, but
he/she/they did so for his/her/their own benefit:

" 1.10 Data used in this investigation
 This study is based almost entirely on a corpus of material I gathered in the
                      DATA USED IN TillS INVESTIGATION                          31course of two field trips, totaling about fourteen months, conducted in 1980 and
 1982. This corpus includes texts, as well as formally elicited words, phrases and
sentences, all of which were recorded on cassette and transcribed in the field into
notebooks. (Copies of the cassettes and field notebooks are lodged with the
Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies.) Almost the entire body of text was
spoken onto tape at my request, or offered for recording by the narrator.
Although Gooniyandi is in daily use, I recorded no spontaneous monologues
addressed to an Aboriginal (or primarily Aboriginal) audience, and little free
conversation: perhaps an hour in all, and none surreptitiously. A secondary
source of data were the observations I entered into my notebooks of freely
occurring speech, where circumstances did not permit recording on cassette. The
only other primary sources I had access to were the texts Howard Coate had
recorded in the mid-1960s (see previous section), Rumsey's short wordlist, and,
more recently, Tsunoda's elicitation tapes in the Gooniyandi spoken at Margaret
River station.
      About twenty Aboriginal people contributed material to the field
investigation.
      Jack Bohemia (BEM), Nyibaddi, the oldest living speaker of Gooniyandi
(aged over eighty), was my main collaborator. A tracker of some thirty two
years service to the Western Australian Police Force (sec Aboriginal and Islander
Identity, October 1971, page 15, and Lawrence 1979:46), Jack Bohemia has an
incomparable knowledge of the history of the Fitzroy Crossing area since the
tum of the century. The account of the history since first contact (section 1.6) is
based principally on information he conveyed orally to me. Where possible I
checked and extended (especially by providing dates) his account by a study of
the written sources. I have found no substantial inconsistencies; Bohemia was
always careful to distinguish fact from supposition, and refused to tell me stories
of events about which he had no certain knowledge. He loved telling of his
experiences as a police tracker and as a stockman. I recorded a substantial body of
such texts, which, in accordance with his wishes, are in the process of being
prepared for publication. But Jack Bohemia also participated in the traditional
law; and he never went completely over to the white ways. He is a fully initiated
man knowledgeable in traditional lore and law; he provided me with numerous
mythological texts, accounts of traditional customs (including initiation and
funerary rites), stories of first contact with whites, and songs. During my
periods in the field, Jack Bohemia worked with me for a couple of hours almost
every day, despite his age, telling me stories and assisting me in their
transcription, providing and checking lexical and verbal forms, and translating
 32                             INTRODUCTION   English sentences. His daughter Daisy, herself a fluent speaker of Gooniyandi,
   also told me a number of stories.
         Dave Lamey, a community leader at Bayulu, was another_ im~rtanl
   collaborator. He told me numerous stories, in a variety of genres, tnc1udmg a
   particular type which he alone gave: expository texts, which as.sert relati<:ns
   between entities, and attributes of entities, rather than, like narrattves, descnbe
   siiUations and events in temporal sequence. (Expository texts are characterised
   linguistically by a significantly greater than usual frequency of verbless clauses.)
   A number of lexical items, verbal forms, constructions, and so on elicited from
  Jack Bohemia were counter-checked with Dave Lamey. In 1982, a middle-aged
  man, Lamey started to learn to read and write English. At the same time, I
   worked intensively with him, developing Gooniyandi writing materials'"" and
  teaching him the elements of writing Gooniyandi.
        Higfootjagadda (see page 14 above), probably the most knowledgeable
  living Gooniyandija/ngangooddoo or 'lawman', and Joe Dimay, the owner of a
  dingaddi (tingarri) tradition (Kolig 1981:38), provided a number of important
  mythological (and other) texts. Bigfoot, Dave Lamey and Jack Bohemia, were
  the primary sources for avoidance style speech. Not only did each give me
  lcxkal items peculiar to the style, but they also recorded texts, both monologues
 and planned conversations with one another.
        David Street, one of the youngest, and one of the two fully literate
 speakers, his brother Rainbow, Saturday W. (deceased) and Mick Smith ail
 contributed a number of words and texts. Banjo Bimdayminy (Bunuba), George
 Nayndu (Kija/Bunuba{Ngarinyin) and Lanis P. (Kija/Gooniyandi, deceased)
 provide{) invaluable assistance in text transcription.
        At the Yiyili Community, Norman Cox, Ivy Cox, Judy Cox, Dorris Cox,
Frank Cox, Irene, Jocelin, Penny Madeline, Lyon, and Mervin Street (the
youngest fluent speaker of Gooniyandi, and an accomplished artist and story
teller) all told me stories and assisted in detailed articulatory-phonetic work (see
below), and in the preparation of texts for a school reader.
.      A corpus 'consisting of over six thousand sentences plus some thousands of
ISolated words was assembled as the primary database for the present study. Tbe
r~ajo~ part .~f this corpus was systematically elicited from native speakers of
(,oomy~ndt m response to English prompt words and sentences. Included in the
corpu;; Is all formally elicited material, as well as all sentences from half a dozen
or mor.e texts. Nearly all of the textual material gathered has been scanned at
somt~ lim~ or other, and a selection of the interesting utterances have also been
mduded m the corpus.
                       DATA USED IN THIS INVESTIGATION                              33        Very early in the course of the fieldwork I became aware of problems
 inherent in the standard field procedure of eliciting responses to clccontcxtualisz~d
 English sentences. It was frequently the case that speakers would, on different
 occasions give three or four distinct translation equivalents to a single English
 prompt. This problem was particularly bothersome in dealing with categories
 which express the speakers' viewpoint and evaluation of the proposition. For
 example, a single English verbal category such a'> future tense, which, as is well
 known, expresses modal as well as temporal meaning, might emerge as any om~
 of three or four Gooniyandi verbal categories (sec section 6.5. 1.3). 'I11c difficulty
 is that evaluative meanings such as these arc not as readily accessible tu the
 linguist as are the representational or content meanings -- that is, cxrx~ricntial
 meaning in Halliday's (e.g. 1970, 1985) terms. It is as a rule easier lO dclcrminc
 whether or not the linguist and the native speaker have matching
conceptualisations of the situation described by the English prompt than it is to
determine (out of context) whether they coincide in their perceptions of the
viewpoints and evaluations expressed.
       It was clear that in the majority of cases native speakers did not perceive
equivalences, or even unmarkecl correlations between grammatical cmegorics of
English and Gooniyandi. They did not translate prompt sentences category by
category; they appeared to regard translation as a semantic procedure, mther than
a formal operation on strings of linguistic symbols. I could detect no tendency
for speakers to invent calques on English constructions, which, likl~ 'to want'
complement clauses, are expressed by means of totally different categories ami
constructions in Gooniyandi (cf. Heath 1984:582). In seeking a translation for
an English prompt,6 it seemed that the Gooniyandi speaker first imagined some
context in which the English sentence might be uttered, and then found n
suitable Gooniyandi sentence which would have roughly t11c surnc sense in 1hat
context. The problem was that I had no access to the imagined context As a
consequence, it was necessary to modify my method of elicitation so as to
circumscribe, and gain some control of the conteXL'>. This was dnne by verbally
constructing imaginary and real scenarios, especially ones of which both
participants (Gooniyandi speaker and linguist) had some knowkdge. I would
request utterances appropriate Lo describing t11cse situations, and uttcmnccs whit:h6 This is an oversimplification. In most cases the Gooniyandi speaker did not
speak Standard Australian English, and there was no certainty that s/hc put the
srune values to the categories as I did. Nor could misunderstandings he entirely
eliminated by my using Kriol or Pidgin (of which I claim little speaking contml)
as the prompting language.
 34                              INTRODUCTION an intcractant in the situation might make. In this way the possible senses of
 !he English prompt are relatively restricted and there is a better .ch~ce that the
 linguist and the native speaker were referring to the same sttuattons, from
 similar viewpoints.
 Formally elicited utterances can never be completely deco~textu.alised, ~d all
 sorts of speakers' behaviour indicated that they did no~ pe:cetve elt~er th~~ o_wn
 or my utterances as isolated. For instance, frequent swttchmg of toptc, ehcttatwn
 of paradigms, and requests for implausible utterances (such as 'you died') were
 frequently met with by resistance such as boredom, and, less frequently. re~sal to
 produce the requested form. More interestingly, the entities I established m my
 English prompts were treated as belonging to the participant-register of the
 discourse, and where possible, treated as ""given"" (Halliday 1970: 162). Speakers
 did not like being forced to translate the English NPs verbatim (see also below
 page 251 and section 5.3.1). It is clear that speakers regarded the elicitation
 process as text-producing, and their responses were characteristic of genres
 appropriate to the referential content. Much of the formally elicited data is, then,
 in a sense controlled, or constructed text, rather than isolated, decontextualised
 sentences. The primary thrust of elicitation was to develop and construct such
contexts as might not frequently arise in conditions where recording was possible.
       Because elicitation is text-producing, and because many morphemes and
 morpheme combinations are unlikely to arise in free texts, I do not even aspire to
Heath's (1984:4) ideal of a ""corpus-based grammar"" (where 'corpus' includes free
!t•xts only). Although I am mindful of the many dangers inherent in using elicited
materials. I cannot concur with Heath's assessment that he had "" ... no confidence
whatever in such data, since my own early ""data"" of this type often turned out to
be: seriously wrong"" (Heath 1984:5). As I will discuss later, I feel that this
mtsrepresents the nature of linguistic data, by taking it to be an observable
Clbject, independent of the observer.
       By far the most problematic aspects of elicitation seem to me to relate to
the practices of seeking speakers' judgements of utterance acceptability (see
~low), and their intuitions and explanations of meaning differences. In the
mcumstances of ~y field:vork these did not prove to be very satisfactory field
~etho~s. and I av?t~ed !herr usc as much as possible. As a rule, in those instances
~~ W~tch two dtshnct forms might conceivably refer to the same referent
Sltuauon, speakers were unable to pin-point the subtle distinctions in meaning
conv~yed ?Y the variant modes of expression. I was invariably informed that no
meamng dtfference existed.      ln the ~ourse of producing material for the Gooniyandi language
~rogram~ne m the Yiyili Community School (see section 1.8), I had
c pponu~1ty to ca:efully check my transcriptions of a number of words, and my
P~~l~t'm 1.~ ~nalys1s. Careful.auention was paid to 'problem areas', especially: (I)
dtsttngmshmg between ap1co-alveolar, apico-postalveolar and lamino-dental
consonant.~. which I experienced great difficulty in telling apart (since then I
have. fm:nd that the phonetic contrasts in Gooniyandi are not as perceptible to
the English car as are tlle phonetic contrasts between the corresponding segments
                      DATA USED IN THIS INVESTIGATION                            35 in some other Australian languages); and (2) the question of whether the cont.rnst
 between apico-alveolars and apico-postalveolars is neutralised word initia1ly (as
 it is in many Australian languages). Many words were checked with more than
 one speaker, and over more than one repetition (successively and on different
occasions), using both auditory and visual evidence. From this work, I produced
 a dictionary of about I 000 items, the phonemic representation of which I am
 relatively confident. This dictionary, which includes all items of Hale's 100 word
 list, the relevant items of Douglas (1959/1977), as well as all words from the
 texts chosen for the school book, and a number of 'suspicious' and crucial words,
is the primary data base for the statistical analysis of phoneme distributions
(section 2.2.5).
        The investigation into tlw textual organisation of the clause (section 5.3),
as well as a significant part of the study of the clause complex (section 5.6), is
based primarily on textual material. (Initial hypotheses were, however,
formulated on the basis of the elicited corpus.) From a large corpus of twenty or
more hours of recorded texts, fifteen texts were selected for close scrutiny; three
of these appear in Appendix I. These fifteen texts, which were chosen more or
less at random- and not for any reac;ons of their merit as coherent texts- are
monologues encompassing all genres represented in the corpus. There is no
reason to b~lieve that they are not typical representatives of their genres. They
were narrated by three different individuals, including the youngest and the oldest
speakers. The chosen texts vary in length from about a minute and a half to over
ten minutes, in all totaling about forty-five minutes. Altogether there are alXlllt
800 clauses. The texts had been transcribed word for word in the field with the
assistance of the speaker; most had also been worked over on at least one
occasion with another native speaker. I studied them again away from the field,
attempting to identify and mark in significant suprascgmental features, which I
was convinced played an important role in the organisation of the text as a
message bearing unit (sec section 5.3).
        The reader will notice that no sentences are starred as unacceptable or
ungrammatical in this grammar. The present description is based entirely on
occurring, and ipso facto acceptable, sentences. Problems in eliciting acceptance
or rejection of conslructed examples arc well known, and I will not go into them
here- but see for example Bolinger (1968), Christie (1980), Haas (1973), and
Quirk and Svartvik (1966). Suffice it to make Lhe following three observations,
specific to the context of my research. Firstly, speakers were as a rule unwilling
to label utterances I produced a<> unacceptable - rather than respond to the actual
form of my utterance, they almost invariably presumed that I intended to express
36                           INTRODUCTIONsome meaning, and attempted to determine and respond appropriately to that.
And secondly, on the other hand, in more than one instance in which a speaker
had firmly rejected an invented example, he later used the same construction
himself. The reasons for the initial rejection always remained unclear to me.
Finally, my theoretical purpose is not, and was not, to delimit the class of
grammatical sentences (if indeed such a class is well defined - cf. Hocketl
1967), but rather to describe and account for the meaning potential of
Gooniyandi utterances.

94                       PHONETICSANDPHONOUOGYexamples I have elicited. For example,
      (bayal-wiri}   ~   /bayaliri/ 'he swims'
                     ~   ['pauel,ut] (I have not heard ['patre,ltn].)
In this case, the phonetic realisation shows that phonologically the syllable
boundary must follow the consonant (!ba.yal.i.ri/), as would also be true under
the assumption that the verbal root and the classifier complex are independently
syllabified.
       When /w/ is lost intervocalically, the result is usually a phonetic long
vowel. For example, {mila-wila} 'I see him', phonemically /milaala/, is
pronounced [,mt'la:lA]. There seems to be no hann in assuming that phonem-
ically there is a syllable boundary between the two Ia/ vowels, giving boundaries
/mi.la.a.la/ in the above example (see also page 69 above, and page 128 below).
Under this assumption the realisation as a long vowel and stress placement may
be accounted for in a similar way as the phonetic realisations of /i'yi/ and
/oo'woo/ sequences- that is, ['(C)i:] and ['(C)oo:] respectively (cf. 2.1.6.1
and 2.1.6.2). It is therefore necessary to recognise syllables of the type V and
VC, where V is either i or a.
       In words such as milaala 'I see him', speakers appear to perceive a
morpheme boundary within the long /a:/. They use a variety of ways to indicate
it, including the insertion of a glottal stop [?), diphthongisation, and shifting of
stress from [ ,l a:] to [l a,A] ,in the example above. Note however that these
modifications are restricted to elicitation sessions, where their purpose is to
indicate the existence of the morpheme boundary to the linguist. The long faa/
phoneme is never modified in these ways (see above page 69).
[2] Elsewhere, there are a few more bound morphemes with initial /w/ which
disappears under phonological conditions identical with the above. For example,
      (yoowooloo-wanya}     ~ /yoowoolaanya/       'other men'
                            ~   ['juQ'la:Jle]
As before, I will assume that a syllable boundary separates the two Ia/ vowels
phonemically, each morpheme being assigned syllable boundaries separately, and
that the two syllables are fused into one phonetically.","[43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79]"

terms of these principal factors, with the difference that the relationship between
A 1 and A2 is not the subset relation, but a scalar relation, whereby A 1 is
evaluated as less than A2 on some presupposed scale of assessing items of the
type A. This may involve potency, impressiveness, size, etc. In addition, these
senses are all of the interpersonal type.
      Sense (iv) 'one and the same', like (iii) 'same', occurs when the scope is an
entity or place, and the time is speech situation, rather than thesis time. But in
this case, -nyali REP has an interpersonal function, contradicting an implicit
expectation that there is more than this one item involved. Furthermore, the fact
                                                                                           I

                                                                                           II
ranked higher than more than one in terms of living arrangements.
       Senses (x) 'precisely, exactly, just', (xi) 'really, very', and (xii) intensive,
may at first seem to contradict the description of (6-69): apparently the asserted
is smaller than, and narrows down on the presupposed. However, whilst this
may be true for a size scale, it is not true in general. Each involves some
different (but implicit) scale of evaluation, which correlates with the type of
thing that A 1 and A 2 are, and thus with the scope of -nyali REP. According to
this scale, A 1 is less than A 2•
       For (x), A 2 is a definite entity or place, and At is an indefinite set including
A 2• In other words, there is a presupposition at a time before the utterance of the
clause that something or somewhere is involved, but this time or place is not
definitely pinned down. The entities or places are compared, not by their relative
size, but the inverse: the more explicit and precise is not less than the less
explicit and precise. That is, the asserted exactly x is evaluated as higher on the
scale than a presupposed anything/something, including possibly x. Roughly,
definite > indefinite.                                                                     I
       Sense (xi) arises when A 1 and A 2 are attributes or properties of the same         I
type. At and A 2 are evaluated on a scale of the degree to which the property is
held. The asserted property A2 is higher on the scale - the property is held to a
greater degree- than the presupposed property A 1, either mentioned earlier with
respect to another carrying entity (example (6-62)), or assumed by the speaker to
be supposed by the hearer with respect to the same entity (example (6-61)).
       Sense (xii) 'intensive' may be accounted for in a similar way. Here A1 and
A 2 are times (or time spans), the latter exemplifying the central or paradigm
point of reference of the temporal adverb; the former making non-specific
reference to the entire time span, or some indefinite point on it. A 2 is evaluated
as higher on the scale than A 1 because it is both more definite, and a more
central instance of the time period.
       At this stage, it is not certain how sense (xiii) 'really, surprisingly' should
be accounted for. At least two distinct alternatives suggest themselves. Firstly,
we could group this sense together with the four senses just discussed, as
involving a scalar relationship between the A's. For this, let A2=process, and let
the presupposed A 1 be that the process did not occur. This invokes a scale
'occurred > did not occur'. Alternatively, we could place this sense along with
the external senses (vii) 'always' and (viii) 'throughout'. As examples (6-64) and
(6-65) above illustrate, sense (xiii) normally arises when the situation involves a
474                            TOPICS IN SEMANTICSnumber of repetitions of the situation again and again. This suggests that we
could set A 1=A2=process, and T as the time of the last occurrence of the process.
There would be a presupposition that the process occurred at least once before;
the sense of 'surprisingly' would arise from the fact that the process occurred
repeatedly, rather than just the one time. Since it would appear that both of these
are valid interpretations of formula (6-69), it does not really matter which was
actually intended in the particular cases of examples (6-64) and (6-65).
      The final sense (xiv) 'just, only' has a fairly obvious explanation in terms
of a relationship of 'identity' between A1 and A 2 , which both refer to places
which are in between the beginning and end of the journey. That is, it is
presupposed that the speaker was somewhere in between at an earlier time. This
is exactly as for sense (vi) 'still'. The difference is that the sense 'still' occurs in                                                                                           l
the context of an expectation that the situation might have ceased, whereas 'only'
occurs when there is an expectation that the situation might never have occurred.
(6-66), that is, contradicts an expectation that the speaker would not get tired
during his journey.
      It will be clear from the preceding discussion that the contextual senses (i)
to (xiv) identified for -nyali REP are slippery, and shade into one another. It is
by no means always perfectly clear how each should always be accounted for in
terms of the underlying formal meaning. But this does not really matter. What is
more important is the general principles or variables involved, and their values;
this gives us a CLASSIFICATION of the contextual meanings into types, rather
than just a catalogue of tokens. The important variables include: the scope of
-nyali REP; the values of A 1 and A2 and the way in which these are related to
each other; the nature of the referent situation; the nature of the time T (whether
                                                                                           \•
thesis or speech situation); the function of -nyali REP in the utterance (whether
textual or interpersonal); and finally, within the counterexpectative uses, the
nature of the expectation involved (whether it is of non-continuity of action or
whatever.6.3.3 -moowa ON
This enclitic, which almost always translates into English as 'only', is slightly
more restricted than -nyali REP in terms of the range of units that it can occur
with: it can be attached to lexical words of any type, except for verbal roots and
stems. Its domain always includes the word to which it is attached, and may
extend to the phrase of which that word is a constituent.
Although I never heard a speaker using -moowa ON in a VP, one example which I
constructed, ngoorloogmoowala (drink-ON-I:extended:to:it), was immediately
                                   ENCliTICS                                  475
accepted and understood to mean 'I only drank it'. Note that in Jaru -muwa 'only'
can be attached to preverbs (Tsunoda 1981:208).
      Very occasionally the form -miya is used instead of -moowa ON (see
example (6-46)). This is certainly a borrowing from Bunuba, and was heard only
in the speech of one of the younger speakers I worked with.
      Unlike -nyali REP, from the English speaker's point of view -moowa ON
seems clearly monosemous, with an invariant sense that is captured quite well in
the gloss 'only':
     (6-70) nganyi -ngga -moowa        milala
            I        ERG ON            I:saw:it
            'Only I saw it.'
     (6-71) yoowooloo midda -moowa damboonggiri
            man       head ON      it:is:exposed
            'Only the man's head is showing.'
     (6-72) booloomani -ngaddi     -moowa barngiyiddi
            bullock      COMIT ON           we:started:back
            'We returned with bullocks only.'
       Like the English word only, the enclitic -moowa ON is an expectation
modifier with two main senses (McConvelll983a): (a) the SUBSET meaning, in
which the asserted entity is a subset of the set of things expected to play that
particular role in the clause; and (b) the SCALAR meaning in which entities are
ranked on some scale (usually of potence) and the participant asserted as
fulfilling a particular role in a process ranks lower on the scale than does the
expected participant. Examples (6-70) and (6-71) illustrate the subset sense: in
(6-70) the Agent, the speaker, is a proper subset of the set of individuals
expected to see the thing; and similarly in (6-71), the man's head is included in
the set of things that are expected to be visible, namely his entire body.
       An example of the scalar sense is the following:
     (6-73) yaningi -moowa bijngarni
            now       ON         he:emerged
            'He's only just arrived (here).'
Here 'now' is evaluated as lower on a scale of potency than 'before' or 'long ago'.
The individual had just arrived in the area, and was thus not expected to be
knowledgeable about the country, people or their customs; he was not a member
of the group, and so did not rate highly in the eyes of the residents. Another
example is:
476                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICS      (6-74) nhoowoo thangarndi wila -moowa gliggiri
             his        word        finish ON     he:goes:glig
             '(The eagle's) language isjustglig.'
This sentence, which occurred freely in a discussion of bird calls, clearly            t
                                                                                       '
evaluates the noise of the eagle as against the noises of other birds. Since most
other birds have a rich variety of calls the eagle might be expected to too;
however, it has only glig.                                                             \
      The encliticisation of -moowa ON to wila 'f""mish, that's all' in (6-74), may
be seen as a means of avoiding the problem that -moowa ON cannot occur on
verbal units. The particle winhi 'nothing' (as it is usually glossed by native
speakers of Gooniyandi- see also below 6.4.7), is most frequently found in
this function, where it is often followed by -moowa ON, usually indicating that
the asserted process is evaluated as less potent than the expected process. For            I
example,
      (6-75) winhi -moowa danymilila mangaddi mila/a
             nothing ON            I:heard:it not I:saw:it
                                                                                           I
             'I only heard it, I didn't see it.'
As the preceding two examples illustrate, for processes, -moowa ON usually
conveys the scalar sense.
     The two senses, scalar and subset, are not always distinct, and there are
examples, such as (6-76), which are amenable to either interpretation. In this
example, the speaker was contradicting what he understood to be the hearer's
expectation that he had had a lot to drink, and was incapable of work.
      (6-76) gamdiwiddi -moowa ngoorlooglimi
             two           ON        I:drank:it:up
             'I drank only two (cans of beer).'
(6-76) could also have the subset sense if, for instance, the two cans had come
from a carton of beer.
      Because of this potential ambiguity, I suggest that the two meanings,
subset and scalar, are particular instantiations of a more general relation 'is less
than', where the exact nature of this relationship is not specified. A formal
meaning may thus be assigned to -moowa ON as follows:
      (6-77) Assertion y < Expectation x
where < symbolises 'is less than'. In the context of evaluation < indicates a
ranking, giving the scalar sense; otherwise the subset meaning is forced- only
                                   ENCUTICS                                   477relative size is relevant. The two senses, subset and scalar might be relabelled
'plain' (non-evaluated) expectation and 'evaluated' expectation respectively.
      It must be remarked that what is expected need not be a definite
circumscribed set, or point on an evaluation scale. It may be fuzzy: for example,
it is unlikely that the speaker assumes a definite numerical value for the
expectation in (6-76). The important point is the relationship: the assertion is in
some sense less than the expectation.
       All of the above is perfectly in accord with what the English speaker would
expect, granted that there is a syntagmatic restriction preventing -moowa ON
from occurring with verballexemes. There are, however. occasional instances
which do not accord so well with English expectations, and for which -moowa
ON cannot be glossed 'only'. These fall into two classes of set expressions,
illustrated by (6-78) and (6-79) below.
     (6-78) boorijbidda middi -yoo -moowa
            they:danced sun      DAT ON
            'They danced till dawn.'
      (6-79) wardgiri wangmadda thithi -moowa
             he:walks mad          going ON
             'He's walking along madly, up and down.'
I suggest that these uses are explicable as contextualisations of the formal
meaning given in (6-77). The 'till' sense in (6-78) may seem to be the inverse of
'only'; but what is happening here is that (6-78) is asserting that they danced
with no purpose in mind other than reaching dawn. Significantly, 'till' seems to
be restricted to just a few verbs referring to singing and dancing. In a similar
way, (6-79) compares the expectation that a person will normally walk
purposely to some destination with the actuality that this particular individual
has no purpose to his movements.
It is interesting that McConvell (1983a:21) cites a Gurindji example exactly
parallel to (6-78), his example (103). However, it seems that the corresponding
Gurindji enclitic -rni 'only' has a more regular and extensive set of senses
including the 'even' and 'right up to' sense (McConvell 1983a:21). Much of this
range is of course covered in Gooniyandi by -nyali REP.6.3.4 -nyooloo ETC
-Nyooloo means 'etcetera' or 'and so on', and is apparently attached to nominals
only. Very few examples of -nyooloo ETC are available, and they show two
main contexts of use.
478                          TOPICS lN SEMANTICS    (i) -Nyooloo ETC may occur on the last nominal of a list, in which case it
means 'etcetera':
      (6-80) diyadiya jalgaddoo -nyooloo
             peewee jabiru          ETC
             'peewee, jabiru, etc.'
     (ii) It may be attached to an indefinite determiner, in which case it means
roughly 'all kinds, all types': jaji-nyooloo (something-ETC) 'all kinds (of
animal)'.6.3.5 -ngaddaya TOO
This enclitic, which has an invariant phonological shape, may be attached to
nominal or adverbial units, but not to verbal units. It has two main senses, 'any,
some', and 'too, also'; these are in complementary distribution according to
whether the unit to which it is encliticised has indefinite or definite reference. It
can be shown that these two senses are ultimately related.
(i) 'any, some'. Encliticised to an indefinite unit, -ngaddaya TOO can be given
the English gloss 'any, some'. Examples are:
      (6-81) ngoorndoo -ngaddaya migawimi
             someone    TOO      he:will:say
             'Anyone/someone may say.'
      (6-82) ngoonyi -ya       -ngaddaya riwi     milayawidda          banyangi
             which     LOC TOO             camp they:allegedly:saw:it outside
             'They've seen it (the country they want) somewhere, outside.'
      (6-83) manyi          -ngaddaya ngabba
             vegetable:food TOO        you'll:eat:it
             'Do you want to eat anything?'
      (6-84) wamba -ngaddaya yiganyi      jagjawimingiddangi
             later   TOO        uncertain he:might:tell:us
             'Sometime later on he might tell us.'
      The indefinite plus -ngaddaya TOO asserts, against an implicit expectation
to the contrary, that at least one item, whose identity is unknowq, is involved in
the situation. The clause contradicts a expectation that the situation did not, or
will not, occur. The type of indefiniteness involved in this use of -ngaddaya
TOO must be distinguished from at least three other types of indefiniteness: the
                                    ENCUTICS                                     479'identity unknown' sense of the indefinite determiners ngoonyoo 'which', yaabja
'some', ngoorndoo 'who', etc.; the 'something/ someone, I don't know and it
doesn't matter which' sense of the enclitic -widdi UNKN; and the 'possibly, but
not certainly' sense of the enclitic -mi - -ma IND. None of these latter invoke
any expectation that the situation did not occur. The indefinite plus -ngaddaya
TOO is used to assert, against an implicit expectation to the contrary, that at
least one entity of the indefinite set (referred to by the lexeme) is involved in the
situation. Thus (6-81) occurred in a text concerning the desire of the Bayulu
people to gain title to a small tract of land forming a tiny comer of an enormous
cattle station. The speaker is imagining. contrary to his belief or expectation to
the contrary, that someone would say to them that they could take the land.
Similarly, (6-82), which comes from the same text, contradicts an implicit
presumption that the speaker attributes to the authorities, that the Bayulu people
do not really want any land of their own.
       On the other hand, the unmarked indefinite phrases (such as ngoorndoo
 'someone', yaabja 'some', etc.) and those followed by the enclitic -widdi UNKN
 are not found where there is a presumption that the situation does not obtain.
 Rather, if ~ere is any presumption involved, it is that the situation does obtain:
 the indefinite indicates that it is the identity of the relevant entity (or whatever)
 in the situation that is not known to the speaker (cf. the discussion of questions
 in section 5.4.1).
This clarifies the nature of the difference between the opposition some vs. any in
English and -widdi UNKN vs. -ngaddaya TOO in Gooniyandi (which on first glance
appear parallel). Roughly, English favours 'some x' where a unique referent is
expected; and 'any x' when there is doubt as to whether an x was in fact involved,
or if the situation holds for every member of the given set. Neither of the English
terms counters an expectation or presumption contrary to the statement of the
clause itself, which is the only circumstance in which -ngaddaya TOO occurs.
Otherwise, an indefinite determiner (or NP) will cover the meaning of 'some' and
'any'.
     Exactly as predicted by the above remarks. negating a clause with an
indefinite followed by -ngaddaya TOO has the effect of indicating that no one or
nothing was involved in the particular role in a situation of the type referred:
      (6-85) mangaddi ngoorndoo -ga      -ngaddaya wardnginbidda
             not       someone       ERG TOO       they:took:me
             'No one gave me a lift.'
    A slightly different nuance occurs when -ngaddaya TOO is encliticised to
number words, as shown in the following example:
480                           TOPICS IN SEMANTICS      (6-86) joongoolmi garndiwiddi -ngaddaya gambayi gajgoondimi
             skin        two           TOO       boy        they:cut:them
             'They circumcise any/at least two boys (in any ceremony).'
This clause occurred in a context in which it is likely that the speaker was
contradicting what he understood the hearer to believe, that one boy could be
circumcised at a time.
(ii) 'too, also'. When attached to a unit with definite reference, -ngaddaya TOO
indicates 'including the referent x among other things'. It can normally be
glossed with the English words 'too' and 'also', but its meaning only partly
coincides with that of these two English words. Some examples are:
      (6-87) nginyji -ngaddaya   goon.goodoo waddin.ginggi
             you     TOO         phlegm           you:were:sick
             'You were sick too (i.e. as well as everyone else).'
      (6-88) moorloo -ngaddaya yilba          bithawaami
             eye        TOO       for:good it:is:stiff
             'His eye too is no good (that is, as well as his leg).'
      And in negative clauses, the written English translation normally employs
'either' (though the spoken variant can employ 'too'); it is clear that exactly the
same sense of the enclitic is involved. For example:
      (6-89) nganyi -ngaddaya marlami diribbingi
             I         TOO         nothing I:will:go:in
             'I can't go in either.' (Literally: 'Me too, I can't go in.')
      When it occurs in this sense, -ngaddaya TOO normally occurs on the
initial word of the clause, this word also being the marked information focus of
the clause (see section 5.3.1). This means that what follows is given
information, which is marked as presupposed. (6-87), for instance, occurred in a
context in which it was well known that an epidemic of the 'flu was going
around. That is, -ngaddaya TOO is used when there is a presupposition that a
similar situation involving at least one other entity obtains. It asserts, against
an implicit expectation to the contrary, that this is not the entire set of things
for which the situation obtains; the referent of the nominal to which it is
attached being an additional one.
      -Ngaddaya TOO clearly contrasts with two other morphemes which
sometimes translate into English as 'too': the enclitic -nyali REP, and the
particle joorloo 'together'. The latter asserts merely that the things concerned are
                                    ENCLITICS                                   481involved in the situation as a group, and involves no presupposition or
expectation. On the other hand, -ngaddaya TOO does not suggest that there was
concerted involvement in the situation.
      -Nyali REP differs from -ngaddaya TOO in terms of scope: the former has
as its scope the presupposed part of the situation, and indicates that it is
repeated; the latter has the new, and non-presupposed part as its scope. There is
no implicit expectation to the contrary (cf. discussion of sense (ii) in section
6.3.2). Compare for instance the following pair:
     (6-90) yoowooloo manili biddib -nyali -yingi
            man         nose block       REP be:catches:it
            goon.goodoo -ngga
            snot          ERG
            'The man's nose is blocked too.'
      (6-91) nganyi -ngaddaya    biddibngindi
             I       TOO         it:blocks:me
             'My nose is blocked too.'
Both (6-90) and (6-91) involve presuppositions that there was at least one other
person whose nose was blocked. But, with the use of -nyali REP in (6-90). a
new member is simply added to the set of people with colds. By contrast, the
use of -ngaddaya TOO in (6-91) adds the new member in face of an expectation
that it was the members of the presupposed set, and nothing more, for which the
situation obtained. Summarising, in its 'too' sense -nyali REP has a textual
function of continuity (see above page 4 70); but the 'too' sense of -ngaddaya          \'
TOO occurs when this enclitic fulfils an interpersonal function.
      These two senses can be accounted for as contextualisations of a single
formal meaning, given in the following formula:
      (6-92) -ngaddaya TOO:                                                             ,,
                                                                                        !;   '                 Expectation: A 1
                  Assertion: A 2                                                        i!             where A 1 and A2 are determined by the scope of -ngaddaya TOO, and
             A 2 is not contained in A 1•
This differs somewhat from the description given in McGregor (1984b:390),
where it was claimed that the relation between A 1 and A 2 was containment: the
latter contains the former. However, as we will see shortly, this is too strong a
statement; what is invariant is that A 2 is not contained in, but may overlap with,
A 1 • In effect, the asserted adds new things, beyond what was expected, to the class
of things for which the situation obtains. Compare also the Gurindji -payin 'too'
discussed in detail in McConvell (1977:23).
482                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICS      This formula is a type of complement to formula (6-77) above which
describes the formal meaning of -moowa ON. It involves only the set-theoretic
relation, and not the scalar relation. For -moowa ON, the set relation is that A 2
is a proper subset of A 1; for -ngaddaya TOO, the relation is a strong negation of
this, A 2 is not contained in A 1 • Less formally, -moowa ON reduces from the
expected, while -ngaddaya TOO adds something new to what is expected.
      Sense (i) 'any, some', as we have seen, occurs in two situations. The first
is where there is a presupposition that the situation does not obtain; that is, it is
expected that NO entity of the specified type is involved. What is asserted is that
at least one entity is actually involved. This asserted A 2 is clearly not contained
in the presupposed set. which is empty. The second is where there is an
expectation that a certain number, greater than zero, of items from the indefinite
set are, or may be, involved. The assertion is that more are actually involved;
here the asserted set CONTAINS but is not contained in, the presupposed set.
      Sense (ii) 'too, also' occurs where there is a presupposition that a set of
entities exclusive of the one referred to by the constituent to which -ngaddaya
TOO is added, is the entire set involved in the situation. The asserted A2 is
clearly not contained in the presupposed A 1 ; in fact, the two sets are typically
disjoint.6.3.6 -widdi UNKN
This morpheme is normally encliticised to indefinite NPs and PPs (i.e. ones
whose Entity nominal is an indefinite determiner), where it indicates specifically
that the identity of the referent is unknown to the speaker. The indefinite
determiner itself (when not followed by -widdi UNKN) also suggests that the
identity of the referent is unknown to the speaker, but in addition it may have
the effect of requesting its identity from the hearer (see section 5.4.1). However,
with -widdi VNKN encliticised to it, the indefinite is never response-requesting.
That is, not only is the identity of the referent unknown to the speaker, but it is
immaterial:
      (6-93) ngoorndoo -ga      -widdi    gardbini
             someone     ERG UNKN he:hit:him
             'Someone (it doesn't matter who) hit him.'
The indefinite followed by -widdi UNKN, rather than the indefinite itself,
corresponds closest to the senses of the English indefinites 'someone',
'something', etc .. Native speakers of Gooniyandi normally gave me English
glosses involving 'someone, I don't know who'.

       A form -wini occasionally occurs on open-class nominals meaning roughly
'it could be a [nominal]':
     (6-94) nyamnyamgiri ngoorndoo yoowooloo -wini
            he:whispers    someone man             7
            'Someone is whispering, maybe its a man.'
It remains unclear whether -widdi UNKN and -wini are allomorphs or contrast
with one another; there would seem to be sufficient commonality in meaning to
suggest the former possibility. However, there are too few examples of either
form to test the hypothesis.6.3.7 -jangi SEM
I have already remarked (see page 189) on the atypical syntagmatic properties of
this enclitic, whereby in some of its uses it forms a grammatical unit with the
constituent to which it is encliticised. The fact that this does not invariably
occur, and the variability of its scope (which may be either word, phrase, or
clause level), distinguishes -jangi SEM from postpositions and stem forming
suffixes, and is why I have grouped it together with the enclitics.
      -Jangi SEM may be encliticised to distributional words of all types except
for VPs, and indicates that an entity, a circumstance, or a situation resembles the
one referred to by the constituent included in its scope.
      In comparing Entities, a -jangi SEM syntagm will realise either a
qualifying or a classifying role in an NP, or an Attribute or a circumstantial role
of Manner in a clause. Examples of the first two possibilities are, respectively:
     (6-95) NP[yaanya [diwiwi                -jangz1]NP -nyali wiliddabi
              other      short:necked:turtle SEM         REP long:necked:turtle
            'Another (creature) like the short necked turtle is the long necked
                turtle.'
     (6-96) NP[pp[wajaddi      -nhingi]pp mawoolyi        jirliwa   -jangi]NP
                  [tree type] ABL           little:ones   sinew     SEM
            'fibres of the wajaddi tree.'
For examples of the second pair of possibilities, see above sections 5.2.1.1.1.2
and 5.2.3.4.
     (6•97) illustrates a comparison of temporal circumstances:
484                         TOPICS lN SEMANTICS      (6-97) miga      -ya    bijbiddarni     yaningi -jangi
             like:that LOC they:emerged now            SEM
             'They arrived around this time.'
And (6-98) compares locations:
      (6-98) [pp[ngoonyi -ya]pp -jangz] warlibiddi
                which        LOC SEM river
             'How far is the river?' (Literally 'Like which (other place) is the
                 river (situated).')
     Whole situations are compared in the following two examples. That is,
-jangi SEM is encliticised to the first word of the clause which indicates the
major point or focus of resemblance:
      (6-99) ngidi -jangi David -jooddoo bagiyiddi
             we      SEM            DU        we:Iie
             '(They live under one root) like me and David lie (under one root).'
      (6-100) ngamoo -jangi warang -gila        -yidda
              before    SEM sit         FACT we:were
              '(We would like to be in a situation) like we had it before (when
                 there were no white people here).'
The focal point of these comparisons is of course not a resemblance of the
processes (which is impossible, since -jangi SEM does not occur within VPs),
but some other element in the situation: in (6-99) they live like the speaker and
David do; in (6-100) the situation the speaker would like now is like it was
before white people arrived.
      Finally I remark that -jangi SEM occasionally compares qualities of
entities rather than the entities themselves:
      (6-101) miga      -jangi wardba
              like:that SEM you:will:bring:it
              'Bring another like this.'
(6-101) was used in requesting that I bring the speaker another book like the one
we had been looking at. The point of resemblance was not the physical
properties of the book, but its contents - and the point of the utterance was
that the book should be a good quality one. The adverb miga 'thus, like that' is
the appropriate word to use in reference to such abstract notions - see pages
152-153.

6.3.8 -mi .... -ma IND
As was mentioned above (page 189), -mi and -ma are allomorphs of an
indefinite-marking morpheme, -ma occurring in VPs, and -mi elsewhere. The
type of indefiniteness indicated is 'possibly, but not certainly x', where -ma ~
-mi is encliticised to the expression referring to x:
     (6-102) nginyji ward -ma -wiri
             you      go    IND you:are
             'You'll come?'
     (6-103) nginyji -mi ward -biri
             you       IND go  you:will
             'You'll come?'                                                          I
     (6-104) gidi    -yarndi gawi -binyi m.Jrd -ma -winggiddi
             you(pl) PL       fish   PER go     IND you:pl:will:go
             'You lot will go fishing?'
     (6-105) gawi -binyi -mi wardbinggiddi
                                                                                     I
             fish   PER IND you:pl:will:go
             'You lot are going fishing?'
     (6-106) gidi     -yarndi -mi gawi -binyi wardbinggiddi
             you(pl) PL         IND fish      PER     you:pl:will:go
             'You'll go fishing?' (='Is it you lot who will be going fishing?')
       In (6-1 02) the uncertainty is whether the hearer will come or do something
else; in (6-103) it is whether it is the hearer (as against anyone else) who will
come. Similar remarks apply for (6-104) to (6-106). The remainder of the clause
is presupposed (to the extent that this is possible- obviously in (6-103) and
(6-106) the hearer need not be presupposed as actor, despite its pronominal
reference in the VP) and remains fixed, as a frame within which to place an item
contrasting with the -mi IND constituent.
       This means that -mi ,... -ma IND is semantically related to the indefinite
wordsjaji 'something, what', ngoorndoo 'someone, who', yiniga 'do something,
do what, how', etc .. The difference is that -mi- -ma IND marks one possible
filler of the role. As is the case for the indefinite words, the use of -mi - -ma
IND often requests clarification from the hearer. That is, it often occurs in the
context of eliciting information. (There is no grammatical system of
interrogatives at clausal, or any other level in Gooniyandi- see section 5.4.1.)
       All classes of clausal constituents, including NPs, PPs, VPs, adverbials,
486                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICSand particles can be the focus of indefiniteness, and may be followed by -mi ~
-ma IND. The focus may be a phrasal constituent: this is the case for VPs,
where the focus is always on the process itself - in any participant, time, or
whatever of the process is in doubt, -mi - -ma IND wiU go onto a constituent
realising that function. However, the focus of uncertainty need not be the Entity
of an NP:
      (6-107) manyi nyamani -mi        gooddijginyja
              food    big       IND you:hold:it
              'You have plenty of food?'
There is one context in which -mi ~ -ma IND may arguably function as a root
formative. The d-word yaningimi 'when, sometime' is obviously constructed from
yaningi 'then, at that time, now', together with -mi IND. Whereas -mi IND
normally indicates a possibility, and is typically used in requesting confirmation
or disconfirmation, yaningimi is normally used in requesting information,
temporal location, rather than a yes/no reply. That is, it appears to belong
paradigmatically with the indefinite determiners ngoorndoo 'someone, who', etc ..
      There is one piece of formal evidence that provides support for the
hypothesis of lexicalisation of yaningimi 'when, sometime'. This comes from the
fact that another instance of -mi - -ma IND may occur in the same clause:
      (6-108) yaningimi         ward -ma -wiri
               sometime/when go       IND    you:will:go
               'When might you go?', or 'Maybe you'll go sometime.'
Otherwise, only one instance of -mi - -ma IND may occur in any clause.
      Note that in Bunuba there is an unanalysable lexeme meaning 'when' (Alan
Rumsey, pers. comm.). It is possible that yaningimi is a constructed form,
perhaps invented to replace a lexeme proscribed by a death taboo.
      Disjunction may be expressed through the use of the indefinite enclitic, as
in example (4-93) above. Two forms, -wamiri and -wami, evidently built on
-mi, are sometimes found in the expression of disjunction. (They are, however,
never used as markers of doubt alone.) Example:
      (6-109) wamba barngooddini            yaningi -wamiri
              later    they:are:retuming today        DISJ
              moongaya -wami
              tomorrow DISJ
              'They'll be returning later, today or tomorrow.'
It could be that the -wamiri ... -wami construction marks closed disjunction, as
opposed to the open disjunction of (4-93). However, there are too few examples
to be sure of this. (It is also possible for a disjunction to be closed by means of
another clause. explicitly stating that there are no further possibilities.)

6.3.9 -woo DEF
-Woo may be encliticised to any non-verbal distributional word, and to the
verbal CC (which occurs in position 5 of fonnula F1, page 192); however, it
may not be attached to the verbal stem, as may -nyali REP, and -mi- -ma IND.
The common meaning running through all of its uses is the speaker's assertion:
'definitely x'. In the majority of examples, -woo DEF occurs on the CC, and has
a modal meaning. This will be discussed in section 6.5.3.3. In this section I
will discuss only the cases in which -woo DEF is encliticised to a non-verbal
unit. But there are too few examples of this type to allow f'mn conclusions to be
drawn. The following remarks are tentative.
      -Woo DBF frequently occurs in exclamations, marking the focal point of
the message: it draws attention to the thing referred to by the constituent it is
encliticised to. For example,
     (6-110) garnanganyja -woo migalimiwiddangi
             emu             DEF I:told:them
             'I told them, ""emus!"".'
     (6-111) migalimiwiddangi birla ngirndaji -ya           -woo
             I:told:them          yam this         LOC       DEF
             widdijbiddayi
             they:two:dug:it
             'I told them, ""they dug yams over here!"".'
In (6-110) the speaker draws the hearer's attention to the (presence of) emus. And
(6-111) comes from a text concerned with tracking two lost people. It draws
attention to the place at which the activities of the lost people were discovered.
It is possible that -woo DEF is cognate with the exclarnative suffix -aw found in a
number of Australian languages, including Alyawarra (Yallop 1977:37), Nyigina,
Diyari, and Kaitij (Stokes 1982:122).
      -Woo DBF is sometimes found on particles, usually forming exclamatory
interjections, such as wilawoo 'finished, OK, goodbye', which seems to be more
emphatic than wila, which has the same experiential meaning. An example is:
     (6-112) migayinmiwiddangi marlama -woo ngamoo nangbani
             we:told:them        nothing DEF before         he:died
             'We told them, ""No good! He's already dead."".'
488                         TOPICS IN SEMANI'ICS6.4 Clause modifying particles and adverbials
6.4.1 mangaddi 'not'
This Iexeme is a negative particle which usually has the role of Propositional
Modifier, and indicates that the proposition in its scope is false. It may perhaps
be most accurately glossed 'it is not the case that' - in preference to 'not',
which is a VP constituent in English. (However, for convenience, I will use the
label 'not' in glossing the morpheme, under the understanding that this is an
abbreviation for the longer expression.) The modified proposition may be in any
tense or mood category. (In this respect Gooniyandi differs from many languages
of the Kimberleys, including Ungarinyin (Rumsey 1982b:89), Nyikina (Stokes
1982:280), Nyulnyul (my own fieldnotes), and Miriwoong (Kofod 1978:85) at
least, in which the negative particle occurs with unreal (irrealis and occasionally
negative) modes only.) The meanings of the combinations of mangaddi 'not'
with the various verbal categories are predictable, and will be mentioned at the
relevant points in the discussion of the verbal categories in section 6.5 below.
      The word order generalisations made above (section 5.4.1) apply to
mangaddi 'not'. The only thing that needs to be added on this is that occasionally
two instances of mangaddi 'not' are found in a single clause, as illustrated in the
following two examples. (There are no examples of this phenomenon for other
particles.)
      (6-113) yaadi -yarndi ngarloodoo       mangaddi
              we(U) PL      three            not
              girili -ya     -nyali mangaddl warayaddi
              tree    LOC REP not               we:stood
              'We didn't stand by that tree again.'
      (6-114) mangaddi ganaddaya mangaddl bijginyjawoo
              not      dawn      not      you:will:come!
              'Don't come at dawn.'
It is probable that, as in non-standard English, the two negatives intensify the
force of the negation.
      Mangaddi 'not' occurs in two other contexts. Instead of modifying a full
proposition, mangaddi 'not' sometimes appears to modify a single word referring
to a scalable quality or quantity, as in
      (6-115) wardbiddi mangaddi mamangooddoo grw.
              they:went not         fur               close
              They went only a little distance away.'
             CLAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS                        489This construction, in which the negated quality is followed by a positive term of
the same sense, seems to indicate an intensification of the quality or quantity,
much as English 'very' (which has no counterpart in Gooniyandi).
It might be suggested that mangaddi x can be accounted for as an elliptical clause,
as was suggested above (section 5.4.1) for similar examples with non-scalars.
Against this hypothesis is the fact that in this use mangaddi x is invariably
followed by the corresponding positive, and the two would appear to form a type
of correlative construction. Contrast example (5-255), where the correlation would
seem to be with the preceding clause.
     M angaddi 'not' is also used as an interjection, as a response to both
confirmation (yes-no) and information-seeking questions. In the first case, it
indicates that the asserted proposition is false:
     (6-116) A: nginyji joorloo ngoorloogjimi
                you      too      you:drank:it
             B: mangaddi nganyi mar/ami ngoodtkxJ -yarndi.
                not        I       not         that        PL
                yaabja -ngga ngoorloogbi.dda
                some     ERG they:drank:it
             A: 'You drank with them?'
             B: 'No, not me. That other lot (only) drank.'
It seems that mangaddi 'not' is used in this way only in indicating the falsity of
a preceding positive assertion. Otherwise, marlami 'nothing, without' invariably
occurs if the preceding assertion is negative (see next section).
      The occurrence of mangaddi 'not' in responses to information probes is
rather unexpected to the English speaker. An example of this use is the
following:
     (6-117) A: yinigaanggiddaddi
                you:pl:are:doing:something
             B: mangaddi maa ngabgidda
                not         meat we:eat:it
             A: 'What are you doing?'
             B: 'No( thing), we're eating meat.'
     (6-118) A: jaji      goowajgila
                something I:call:him
             B: mangaddi niyi girli joowooddoo gandiyangi
                not      he     same [subsection] wife's:brother
490                          TOPICS IN SEMANI'ICS                 goowajba
                 you:will:call:him
              A: 'What do I call him?'
              B: 'No(thing). He'sjoowooddoo; you call him brother-in-law.'
It remains unclear just what sense mangaddi 'not' conveys here. In both
circumstances outlined above, mar/ami 'nothing, without' (see discussion of next
section) occurs far more frequently than does mangaddi 'not'.6.4.2 marlami 'nothing, without'
Gooniyandi has another word for expressing negation, mar/ami 'nothing,
without', which indicates that no entity, time, or place is involved in the referent
situation. It corresponds to the English words 'no', 'nothing'. 'nowhere', and
'never', and is frequently glossed najing (from standard English nothing) in
Pidgin English and Kriol. As distinct from mangaddi 'not', mar/ami 'nothing,
without' never functions as a Propositional Modifier. Rather, it negates an entity
or circumstance, and from this the clause itself may gain negative force, as
happens with the English words nothing, nowhere, and so on.
      Mar/ami 'nothing, without' has three main contexts of occurrence, which
are not always distinguishable: (i) it may realise a phrasal role; (ii) it may realise
a clausal circumstantial role of time or place; or (iii) it may be used as an
interjection.
      (i) I will first deal with the case in which mar/ami 'nothing, without'
fulfils a modifying role in an NP. There are two main possibilities: it may
precede or follow the Entity nominal. The relative order is significant, and finds
clearest explanation in terms of Bolinger's (1967) distinction between referent
modification and reference modification, discussed above (see page 267). In
addition, the phrase in which it occurs may function either attributively, within
another phrase (i.e. as a Qualifier or Classifier) or clause, or referentially.
      In the first case, the phrase attributes of an entity the property of being
without something, as discussed in section 5.2.3.5 above. The usual word order
is for mar/ami 'nothing, without' to follow the Entity nominal, as exemplified
in e.g. (4-36) and (4-79). Only rarely does it precede the Entity nominal, as in
      (6-119) nginyji binaddi nganyi marlami         moodiga
              you      know I          not           motorcar
              '(As) you know, I have no car.'
      In referential phrases marlami 'nothing, without' typically precedes the
              CLAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBJALS                        491Entity, and indicates that nothing of the type referred to by the Entity nominal
was involved in the referent situation. In this circumstance marlami 'nothing,
without' clearly modifies the reference of the phrase. For example,
     (6-120) mar/ami gamba ngambiddi baali -ya
             not       water again          road LOC
             'There's no water again on the road.'
     (6-121) marlami banda doowwidtkl
             not       ground they:got:it
             'They got no dirt.'
Note: (6-120) and (6-121) may be contrasted with sentences such as (5-258) and
(5-259) in which mangaddi 'not' occurs in the same place in the clause. There is a
sharp distinction in meaning. With marlami 'nothing, without'. there is no focus
on the following element, and no presupposition that the predicate holds true of
anything (although it may).
      Only occasionally is the reverse order found in referential phrases, and in
this case the absence of the entity is typically less permanent than is the case
with the reverse order where the lack classifies the entity. Compare for instance:
     (6-122) marlami gamba ngoorlooggoodda
             not       water they:drink:it
             'They drink no grog.'
     (6-123) gamba marlami        ngoorloogla
             water not            I:drank:it
             'I drank no grog (yesterday).'
(6-122) referred to a pair of teetotallers, whereas (6-123) described the situation
in which the speaker had drunk nothing on a particular day, though he was a
fairly regular imbiber. The distinction I have proposed might be brought out
with a more accurate and literal paraphrase for (6-123): 'of grog nothing did I
drink'. (This is exactly the distinction between the two types of modification
identified by Bolinger (1967): in (6-123), but not in (6-122), mar/ami 'nothing,
without' qualifies the amount drunk.) Compare also:
     (6-124) marlami binyirdi maa ngabgila galyba ngabgila
             not        hard    meat I:eat:it       soft I:eat:it
             'I eat no hard meat; I eat soft meat.'
     (6-125) manyi -moowa ngabla maa marlami ngabla
             food      ON      I:ate:it meat not     I:ate:it
             'I ate only vegetables; I ate no meat.'
492                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICS     The NP in which mar/ami 'nothing. without' occurs may have, instead of a
nominal referring to an entity. one referring to a property or quality. which it
negates:
      (6-126) waya marlami joodoo
              wire not        straight
              The wire is not straight.'
It is possible that, in the few examples of this type available, the property is as
it were nominalised, so that joodoo (in (6-126)) realises the Entity role in its
NP. If so, such examples could be paraphrased in the manner of '(the) wire has
no straightness' (for (6-126)).
       The NP in which mar/ami 'nothing, without' occurs is subject to ellipsis
and splitting, in the same way as other NPs. Sentences such as (6-127) and
(6-128) are most naturally accounted for in this way: in (6-127) the Entity nalija
'tea' has evidently been ellipsed, being given; and in (6-128) the phrase has been
split.
      (6-127) nalija boordbara mar/ami ngoorloogbila

              I         not       I:hold:it horse
              'I haven't got a horse.'
      It seems that mar/ami 'nothing, without' may also discharge the Entity role
in an NP, in which case it functions as a clausal substitute (Halliday and Hasan
1976:130ff), referring to a non-existent state of affairs. For example,
      (6-129) ngirndi -yarndi ligayawinggiddinyayi      jaddi
              this     PL     you:two:could:wait:for:me if
              mar/ami barnjawinggiddiyi
              not      you:two:will:return
              'You two can wait for me. If nothing (i.e. if I don't come back)
                 you can return.'
This is presumably how marlami 'nothing, without' is used in
      (6-130) marlami -nhingi gindiwa -rni        wc:udjiddi
              not       ABL       upstream SEQ we:went
              'From nothing (i.e. since we caught no fish) we went upstream.'
             Cl.AUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS                      493     But marlami 'nothing, without' is not always used in such a qualifying
sense; it may also be used evaluative1y. That is, the entity involved may be
evaluated as nothing, or worthless, rather than as non-existent. For example,
     (6-131) marlami jijagbi          doorloo yijgawoo
             not         he:will:talk heart   OOd
             'He'll tell you nothing; his heart is no good.'
allows that the individual concerned may talk, but only a little (and not well),
because of his bad heart, and consequent weakness.
      Mar/ami 'nothing, without' is also occasionally found in VPs. as (a part
ot) the Process - see examples (3-1 04) and (3-1 05) above.
      (ii) There are other occurrences in which marlami 'nothing, without' cannot
be viewed as a phrasal constituent. For example, in the following two examples
there is no NP containing mar/ami 'nothing, without'.
     (6-132) marlami wardbi
             not        he:will:go
             'He can't walk.'
     (6-133) marlami wardjiddi
             not       we:went
             We didn't go.'
It is suggested that in such examples marlami 'nothing, without' realises a
circumstantial role of time or place, translating 'never' (or 'at no time') in
(6-132), and 'nowhere' (or 'to no place') in (6-133).
      At present this possibility remains hypothetical. It might be remarked that
unlike mangaddi 'not', marlami 'nothing, without' does not focus on a following
element, nor is there a presupposition that a related process applies to some
other entity (or whatever) in contrast to the focal one.
     (6-134) garndiwangooddoo marlami nganyi milaabidda
             many                 not I      they:see:me
             'They don't see me.'
      Secondly, the force of the negation seems to be more 'generalised' than is
the case for mangaddi 'not'. That is, it indicates that the situation held for no
time, place or entity (within presumed limits) -as in the previous example.
      Thirdly, and related to the first point, there is no evidence that marlami
'nothing, without' modalises the proposition as does mangaddi 'not'. As was
suggested above (section 5.4.1), clauses negated by mangaddi 'not' occur in
    494                         TOPICS 1N sEMANTICS    contradiction to the presuppositions and expectations of the speech-situation.
    And clauses that correlate with them invariably supply the positive counterpart.
    namely, what did happen. (See examples (5-216), (5-370) and (5-371).) But
    clauses negated with mar/ami 'nothing, without' do not seem to invoke such
    relations to the expectations of the speech situation, and they do not appear to
    contradict implicit presumptions of the truth value of the proposition. This
    shows up in the type of clause that correlates with the mar/ami 'nothing,
    without' clause: it never indicates what DID happen2 , but always provides an
    enhancing comment. Some illustrative examples are:
          (6-135) wajbali      mar/ami bijngarni      ngoonyi    -ya    -widdi
                  white:person not       he:emerged something LOC IND
                  waranggiri
                  he: sits

          (6- 136) marlami mila/a      mangaddi niyaji    -ya  warangji
                 not         I:saw:him not         this    LOC he:sat
                 'I didn't see him. He wasn't there.'
     (iii) Mar/ami 'nothing, without' may also occur as an interjection- i.e. as
a minor clause by itself. Like mangaddi 'not', it occurs initially in responses to
requests for confirmation/disconfirmation, and in responses to requests for
information. In the former case, mar/ami 'nothing. without' indicates the correct
polarity for the preceding clause. It does not affirm or deny the proposition
asserted by that clause, as does ngajirta 'not', the negative particle in Walmajarri
-see Hudson and Richards (1978:101). Thus:
          (6-137) A: gaddwaroo bijngarni
                     afternoon he:emerged
                 B: mar/ami jamoondoo bijngarni
                    not       other:day     he:emerged
                 A: 'He arrived yesterday(?)'
                 B: 'No, he arrived the other day.'
          (6-138) A: jamoondoo ngaaddi mangaddi       doowya
                     other:day stone   not            you:got:it
2
    Of course where marlami 'nothing, without' is a phrasal constituent a correlating
~lause may contrast the lack of something with the presence of something else as
m example (6-124).                                                               '

                 not       not         I:got:it
              A: 'You didn't get your money the other day'l'
              B: 'No, I didn't.'
(Note that, as remarked above, both mangaddi 'not', and mar/ami 'nothing,
without' may be used in replying to positive clauses, indicating the falsity of the
proposition asserted. Only mar/ami 'nothing, without' appears to occur in
response to negative polarity clauses, indicating the falsity of the embedded
(negated) proposition.)
     Compare also the following, in which the polarity is negative, though the
potential mode indicates that the situation did not in fact occur:
     (6-139) A: thaddi                 yiwindi gardyanirni
                 mistakenly:believed rain       it:might:have:fallen

                other:day
             B: mar/ami
                 not
             A: 'I thought it would rain the other day.'
             B: 'No (it didn't).'
    Mar/ami 'nothing, without' appears to be used in exact.ly the same way as
mangaddi 'not' in initiating a response to a request of information. It is,
however, far more frequently used in this way than is mangaddi 'not'. Example:
     (6-140) A: jaji        goowa)gzna
                something you:name:me
             B: mar/ami nganyi -ngga ngaloowinyi goowajginya
                not       I         ERG son      I:call:you
             A: 'What do you call me?'
             B: 'Nothing. I call you ""son"".'
      In a closely related use, mariami 'nothing, without' occurs as a type of tag
by which the speaker affirms that the situation did not come to a successful
conclusion, or to its desired conclusion. The tagged clause may be either
positive (example (6-141), or negative (example (6-142).
     (6-141) milalimi marlami
             I:looked     not
             'I looked, but didn't find it.'

              We didn't see any birds, nothing.'6.4.3 woomoorla •not, without•
Woomoorla 'not, without' is a negative particle specific to the avoidance
(mother-in-law) style. It has three main uses.
     (i) Like mar/ami 'nothing, without' it occurs in NPs conveying a privative
sense. For example,
      (6-143) mangaddinyi woomoorla rooginyngiri
              food           not    I:sit
              'I've got no food.'
      (6-144) woomoorla thadda        rooginyngiri
              not           dog       I:sit
              'I've got no dog.'
      (ii) It also occurs as a clause level negative adverbial, as in
      (6-145) woomoorla ngaddagi ngaaddi           woomoor/a ngawooddajbindi
              not        my          stone         not       icarrived
              'My money hasn't arrived.'
      (iii) It occurs as an interjection (or minor clause), at least in the context of
a reply to a request for infonnation:
      (6-146) woomoorla dambalngoo milinggiddila
              not          place         I:am:looking:for:it
              'No, I'm looking for a camp.' (Answer to What are you doing?')
(There are no examples of woomoorla 'not, without' used as a Propositional
Modifying minor clause (see section 5.4.2).)
      It remains unclear whether or not woomoorla 'not, without' is an avoidance
equivalent of both mangaddi 'not' and marlami 'nothing, without'. It certainly
seems to cover the range of senses of mar/ami 'nothing, without' - but it is not
clear whether in its apparent role of negating clauses (as in example (6-145)) it
realises the role of Propositional Modifier, or some circumstantial role. That
mangaddi 'not' itself occurs in avoidance style utterances and mar/ami 'nothing,
without' does not, perhaps suggests that woomoorla 'not, without' is an
equivalent of marlami 'nothing, without' only.
              CLAUSE MODIFYlNG PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS                         4976.4.4 thaddi 'mistakenly believed'
Like the Pama-Nyungan languages to the south and east (including Jaru
(Tsunoda 1981:206), Warlpiri (Harkins 1986:566-567), Arrernte (Aranda)
(Wilkins 1986:588), Wangkajunga (my own field notes) and other Western
Desert dialects, but unlike the nearby non-Pama-Nyungan languages such as
Ungarinyin (Rumsey 1982b), Nyikina (Stokes 1982)), and Bunuba (Rumsey,
pers.comm.), Gooniyandi has a modal particle which indicates that a proposition
which was formerly believed (usually by the speaker), is in fact false. This
particle, thaddi, can usually be glossed 'it was/is mistakenly believed that P'
(where P is the proposition expressed by the embedded clause). In example
(6-147), the mistaken belief is the speaker's; but it is most likely someone else
(whose identity is left unspecified) who was mistaken in (6-148).
     (6-147) nginyji -ngga wooddoogjaddi -ngadda thaddi
             you      ERG you:startled         on:me mistakenly:believed

             devil     ERG he:got:me
             'You startled me. I thought it was a devil who had grabbed me.'

             'It was mistakenly believed that I had hit him, but really it was
                 that other man.'
      In its role as a Propositional Modifier thaddi 'mistakenly believed' occurs
only with past and irrealis potential VPs. 3 With the past tense, as in the
examples above, the proposition mistakenly believed' concerns events in the
past with respect to the time of the (mistaken) thought. On the other hand, with
the irrealis potential, the proposition mistakenly believed' concerns events in the
future with respect to the time of the mistaken thought, and in the past with
respect to the utterance. For example,3 It is clear why, since the embedded proposition must be known to be false at
the time of utterance, which must differ from the time at which the belief was first
held.
498                         TOPICS IN SEMANTICS      (6-149) thaddi               thilmangga bijginyjarnirni

was uttered in a context in which the speaker had earlier entertained the notion
that the hearer would visit him early in the day, but as of the time of speaking
that proposition was false- that is, the hearer arrived late.
       Thaddi 'mistakenly believed' may also realise an experiential role in a
clause, as a circumstance of Manner, but only when the clause refers to a
thought process. The verbal is invariably miga-, in its sense of 'think' (but not
in its sense of 'say' or 'do'). An example is:
      (6-150) migalimi -nganggi thaddi               banyangi        wardginggi
              !:thought of:you mistakenly:believed outside           you: went
              'I thought that you had gone outside.'
It is clear that thaddi 'mistakenly believed' modifies the manner of thought, and
that it does not modify the proposition expressed by either of the clauses in this
example. As a Manner modifier, thaddi 'mistakenly believed' usually follows the
VP. This contrasts with its usual pre-verbal position when in its role of
Propositional Modifier.
      This biclausal construction allows explicit reference to be made to the one
who suffered the misconception that the proposition was true. It is also often
used in reference to past predictions that turned out to be false, as in the
following example.
      (6-151) migalimi thaddi                  ngoomooddoo ranboondirni
              !:thought mistakenly:believed cloud             it:could:go
              'I thought the cloud would go (but it hasn't).'
This construction, with the future potential, appears to be synonymous with
clauses in which thaddi 'mistakenly believed' modifies a proposition in the
irrealis potential.
      It should be noted that it is beliefs about propositions that thaddi
'mistakenly believed' claims to be mistaken. It does not apply to actions, except
as far as actions are based on mistaken beliefs, in which case that belief is
explicitly stated. Thaddi is not used like the English term mistakenly in
examples such as I hit him mistakenly; instead, the following multi-clausal
construction occurs:

 Depending on context, yiganyi occurs in two apparently distinct senses. As a
 Propositional Modifier it indicates possibility, and is normally glossed maydbi
 in the local varieties of Kriol or Aboriginal English. Secondly, it occurs as a        ' circumstance of Manner, in which case it usually indicates that the action was
 done sneakingly. In this usage it is usually glossedjineg (from English sneak)
 by native speakers of Gooniyandi. A single formal meaning is postulated,
 'uncertain', to account for these two apparently distinct contextual senses. (Cf.
 Rumsey 1982b:172-176.)
       As a Propositional Modifier, yiganyi indicates an attitude of uncertainty of
 the speaker towards the proposition s/he is uttering. As a circumstance of
 Manner, this word indicates that the actor performed the action in an uncertain
 manner: gfhe was in a condition of uncertainty as s/he did it. That is, the modal
 particle yiganyi 'uncertain' has both interpersonal and experiential uses: it may
 indicate either a subjective attitude within the speech situation, or a subjective
 attitude in the thesis, the events described - that is, in the mind of the actor. I
 will examine these two senses in turn, adducing evidence in support of the
 postulated formal meaning.
       Firstly, in its role as a Propositional Modifier, yiganyi 'uncertain' appears
 never to be used in drawing inferences from the observed to the hypothetical.
 Rather, it expresses the fact that the speaker just does not have the appropriate
 backing to allow him/her to make a definite assertion. If ever an enhancing
 clause is added to explain why the speaker does not make a plain unmodalised
 statement, it always explains that the speaker did not see, hear or otherwise
 perceive that the event did or did not take place -see example (5-346). It never
 provides evidence suggesting the occurrence of the event to be likely; there are
 no examples of the type, familiar to the speaker of English. illustrated by He
 might have taken it, (likely) because I saw him there. That is, yiganyi
 'uncertain' does not comment on the likelihood of the occurrence of the situation
 referred to, given the speaker's knowledge of the relevant facts: the proposition is
 not evaluated as either likely or unlikely. Thus yiganyi 'uncertain' occurred in
.elicited Gooniyandi equivalents for English sentences involving both maybe and
 maybe not (in which the proposition is evaluated either as more or less likely),
 depending on context. The first sense typically occurs in case the embedded
500                           TOPICS IN SEMANTICSproposition expresses something 'greater than' the expectation of the speaker, in
the sense invoked in sections 6.3.3 and 6.3.5 above. For example (6-153) was
given as an utterance I might make to the speaker, telling him that I might
come to see him one night.
      (6-153) yiganyi maningga wardjawingi
              uncertain night      I:might:come
              'Maybe I'll come one night.'
The sense of unlikeliness is suggested by the fact that otherwise the utterance
would be pointless: I had never visited him before at night, and there was no
expectation that I would start doing so.
     On the other hand, the sense 'maybe not' may be suggested if the
expectation is greater in some sense than the embedded proposition. For
example, the sentence
      (6-154) yiganyi sergeant -ga          lVardba         -ngadda
              uncertain              ERG he:will:bring:it for:me
              'I'm unsure that the sergeant will bring (my uniform). •
was given in response to the English prompt 'Maybe I won't get my uniform
this year'. This was elicited at a time when the speaker was becoming
increasingly convinced that the authorities had forgotten him, and would not
bring him his new police uniform for the Fitzroy Crossing races.
       The point is that yiganyi 'uncertain' does not itself evaluate the proposition
as likely or unlikely. But as elsewhere, the fact that the proposition has been
modalised at all conveys meaning -basically it counters an expectation or
presupposition, and the nature of this presupposition suggests either the 'likely'
or 'unlikely' interpretation of yiganyi.
       The above points are clearly illustrated in example (5-364) which also
contains an embedded negative proposition. This utterance was used to describe a
situation in which a bustard was hit by a Landrover as it was flying up off the
road; the bird flew uncertainly off. As far as the speaker knew, the bird did not
fall (and had not fallen since): this is expressed in the second embedded clause
mangaddi gardgoonaani 'it isn't falling' which is modified by yiganyi 'uncertain',
indicating the speaker's lack of knowledge. At the same time it suggests an
evaluation that it is likely that the bird fell- or otherwise a more neutral mode
of expression, such as for example mangaddi gardbani 'it didn't fall (then)', would
have been chosen. And here 'not falling' is clearly evaluated as greater than
'falling', just as is 'breaking its leg' is greater than 'not breaking its leg'. Yiganyi
              CLAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS                          501'uncertain' can itself indicate neither an evaluation of likelihood, nor a purely
objective viewpoint, that the proposition is purely 'possible' .4 I cannot see how
these senses can be explained unless yiganyi indicates the speaker's attitude of
uncertainty.
It seems that yiganyi expresses the same sort of uncertainty as does the enclitic
-widdi UNK.N (see section 6.3.6), which is restricted to occurring on nominals and
indicates that the speaker is unsure of the referent. And in each instance the
expression of lack of certainty is not normally used if information is being
sought from the hearer.
     As remarked above, in the clausal experiential role of manner, yiganyi
'uncertain' usually translates into English as 'sneakingly', as is shown in the
following examples:
      (6-155) mangaddi yiganyi         -ngga wardnga      balngarna wtU""dnga
              not         sneakingly ERG he:took:it open            he:took:it
              'He didn't take it sneakingly, he took it openly.'
     (6-156) wabjingi      yiganyi       -ngga -nyali
             he:sniffed:it sneakingly ERG REP
             'He sniffed it sneakingly.'
My hypothesis was that this is a contextualisation of the formal meaning of
yiganyi 'uncertain', which refers to a mental attitude of uncertainty, here in the
mind of the actor. In these instances, the type of uncertainty in the mind of the
actor, in the way s/he preforms, is that s/he is cautious and mindful of the
possible consequences of his/her act, which encroaches on the rights of others.
(6-156), for example, described an individual who had sniffed the food collected
by another group of people, to which he had no right, at the same time watchful
of their arrival. He acted without assumnce, uncertain as to whether he would get
away with it.
      However, as
     (6-157) yiganyi warangbinggiddi
             uncertain you:pl:will:sit
             'You lot stay quiet.'
shows, yiganyi does not always find a contextual meaning as 'sneakingly'. The
intent of this utterance is that the addressees, a group of children, should remain4 Note that the reverse order, mangaddi yiganyi 'not uncertain', does not occur.
This fact is consistent with the view adopted here, but is difficult to explain under
the alternative hypothesis that yiganyi indicates possibility.
502                         TOPICS 1N SEMANTICSsitting uncertainly - that is, careful that they do not act in such a way as to
disturb the nearby adults: they should be quiet, and not act with too much
confidence or assurance in themselves.
      It seems that yiganyi signifies a circumspect, unsure, or uncertain mode of
behaviour. In all available examples, this has been with respect to the possible
consequences of the action which always involves human confrontation. No
examples of yiganyi 'uncertain' correspond to the uncertainty of 'the bird flew
uncertainly away' (see above), in which the uncertainty rests in the ability of the
actor to effect the action. It remains to determine the full significance of this
mode of behaviour, which is certain to be culturally specific.
There is an adverb biyari which more properly translates 'sneakingly'. A story of
a man who had escaped from the Derby leprosarium described him as sneaking
back to his own country some hundreds of miles distant. The adverb biyari was
used throughout to describe his behaviour. He travelled all the way avoiding
stations, towns, outposts, etc., staying out of the sight of all Europeans. At no
stage need he have acted without assurance: rather, he acted so as to avoid the
possibility of confrontation. Going biyari 'sneakingly' he could avoid acting
yiganyi 'uncertainly'.
     Finally, I remark that yiganyi sometimes appears to modify a process of
thought - to think uncertainly - as may thaddi 'mistakenly believed':
      (6-158) nganyi migangzn yiganyi marlami yaningi bijboowarni
              I         !:think     uncertain not      today he:could:come
              'I don't think he'll come today.' (My prompt)
If (6-158) is really appropriate to the prompt, yiganyi 'uncertain' is a Manner in
the projecting clause. But it is impossible to be sure of this without more
examples.6.4.6 minyjidda 'true'
This particle, which may be glossed 'true, truly', is most frequently found as an
interjection in a minor clause, following a major clause as a type of
afterthought, reaffirming the speaker's commitment to the truth of the
proposition. minyjidda 'true' is also occasionally found in the role of
Propositional Modifier:
      (6-159) mangaddi woongooloo bagingiri minyjidda waddinngiri
              not        for:fun       I:lie      true I:am:sick
              'I'm not pretending, I'm really sick.'
Here, minyjidda 'true' modifies the proposition expressed by the second clause,
              ClAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS                         503asserting: 'it is true that I'm sick'. At the same time it indicates the seriousness
of the sickness contrasting this with the presumption that the speaker is
pretending.
     Like other particles indicating speaker attitudes, minyjidda 'true' occurs in
clauses of speech in the sense of 'speak the truth' (not - in the available
examples - in the sense of 'actually speak').
     (6-160) minyjidda jagma           -ngadda
             true        you:will:tell to:me
             'Tell me truly.'
(Contrast ngirlijagmingadda (lie he:told:me) 'he told me a lie'.)
     In the following example minyjidda 'true' appears to be an NP constituent:
     (6-161) minyjidda waddamba bijngarni
             true        flood       it:emerged
             'A truly big flood came up.'
      There is a verbal form minyjiddan- 'believe, take notice of, which is
clearly built on minyjidda 'true' (the final -n is a (perhaps meaningless- but cf.
McGregor forthcoming-d) formative. Examples:
     (6-162) nganyi -ngga mangaddi minyjiddangoowaalimi niyaji
             I         ERG not     I:am:believing:it    this
             'I don't believe it.'
     (6-163) nganyi minyjiddangoowaalimi -nganggi
             I        I:am:believing            on:you
             'I believe you.', or 'I'm taking notice of you (i.e. of what you are
                 saying).'6.4.7 winhi 'just, only'
This particle is an expectation modifier which usually translates into English as
'just, only'. (Native speakers, however, preferred to gloss it najing 'nothing' in
their variety of Aboriginal English or Kriol.) It is a clause level counterpart of
the enclitic -moowa 'only, just' (discussed in section 6.3.3), from which it
differs in terms of scope. Whereas the latter modifies speaker's expectations as to
what will fulfil particular roles in the situations referred to, and contains within
its scope constituents of clauses, winhi 'just, only' modifies expectations as to
what situation will occur, and contains full clauses in its scope. Compare for
example, the following pair:
504                         TOPICS IN SEMANTICS      (6-164) winhi wardngi thanganuli -yoo
              just I:went        wml    DAT
              'I only went for a talk.'
      (6-165) wardngi thangarndi -yoo -moowa
              I:went word            DAT ON
              'I went only for a talk.'
In the first example there is an expectation that I might have done something
else; in the second, the expectation is that I might have had some other purpose
in mind in going than just to talk.
       The same formula as was invoked in describing -moowa 'only, just'
(section 6.3.3), Assertion x <Expectation y, accounts for the meaning of winhi
'just, only'. Here x andy are different, however: they are situations, rather than
participants or manners, etc .. That is, winhi 'just, only' evaluates the situation
asserted as occurring as 'less than' the situation expected to occur. Only the
scalar sense (see above page 475) of 'less than' is possible here; the subset
reading clearly cannot apply. Depending on the way the relation 'is less than' is
understood, winhi 'just, only' may contextualise in a few different ways, at least
from an Anglo-centric perspective.
       (a) The occurring situation may be evaluated as less potent in some sense
 than the expected situation. Thus:
      (6-166) mangaddi jijaggiddarni      winhi milayiddarni
              not       we:talk:together only we:look:at:one:another
              We're not talking together; we're only looking at one another.'
(Here of course the second clause replaces the first (see section 5.6.2.1). The
expectation that we might be interacting in some way, such as talking is created
by the larger context (e.g. of culture), and obviously not by the immediately
preceding clause. This remark applies to the following, and a number of other
examples.)
     In this sense, winhi 'just, only' is frequently followed by the enclitic
-moowa 'only', which perhaps intensifies its effect:
      (6-167) wambawoo gardnginbinirni            winhi -moowa
              nearly       he:might:have:hit:me only     ON
              madnginmi
              he:swiped:at:me
              'He tried to hit me, but only swiped me.'
      (b) In a very closely related sense, the evaluation is not so much on a scale
             ClAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVBRBIALS                        505of 'potence', but of the DEGREE to which the situation affects an undergoer. In
the following example, the person referred to is asserted as not being as sick as
might have been expected:
     (6-168) mangaddi gambi        nyamani winhi yalijmi
             not        sickness big            only he:is:sick
             'He's not very sick, just a little off-colour.'
Clearly this sense merges in with (a).
     (c) The asserted occurrence may be evaluated as less than expectation
because the actor is not serious in his engagement in the process. For example,
     (6-169) winhi rooddijginya            mangaddi minyjidda
             only I:am:yelling:at:you not              true
             'I'm just yelling at you, not seriously.'
      (d) The evaluation may rest on an expectation of responsibility of the actor
- that s/he acts with purpose or intent. In this case, the use of winhi 'just,
only' suggests that the action was done without reason.
     (6-170) yaabja yoowooloo wardjawooddoo -nhi               winhi
             some man               they:may:go       to:him only
             wirdinboowoo
             he: bites: him!
             'Should any man go past (the dog). he'll bite him (for no reason in
                 particular).' (This describes a vicious dog.)
      Winhi 'just, only' often occurs in responses to information questions,
where the effect seems to be to counter presuppositions implicit in the question.
(Cf. similar uses of mangaddi 'not' and marlami 'not' mentioned in sections
6.4.1 and 6.4.2 respectively.)
     (6-171) A: gidi     -yarndi -ga    yiniganggiddiwiddangooddoo
                you:pl PL         ERG you:pl:are:doing:something:to:them

                children     DAT
             B: winhi gamba -ga        ligiddyiddra         mawoolyi
                only water ERG we:are:washing:them children
             A: 'What are you lot doing to the children?'
             B: 'Nothing much. We're washing them.'
Cf. Goody's (1978) suggestion that pure information questions, which do not at
the same time challenge the addressee, either by the presupposed right of the
506                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICSspeaker to ask the question, or the presuppositions of the question itself, occur
but rarely (and only amongst social'equals'). And indeed, (6-171) could hardly
have been intended as a pure information question. It was part of an elicited
dialogue (in which the speaker took on both sides) that might occur between a
man and a group of women and children who were bathing in the river. Even if
not intended in this way, such a question would most likely be seen as a
challenge to the addressees. The effect of use of winhi 'just, only' here appears to
be to counter an apparent presupposition or expectation that something untoward
was being done to, or happening to the children.
      McConvell (1983a) discusses a particle jupu 'only, just' in Gurindji which
has an almost identical range of contextualisations as winhi 'just, only'. The one
sense of the Gurindji jupu 'only, just' that does not appear to occur for the
Gooniyandi winhi 'just, only' is 'for a little while' - this may be because
Gooniyandi has a separate temporal adverbial janggoo which carries this
meaning. Similarly, winhi 'just, only' does not frequently occur in sense (c),
since there is a separate adverbial woongooloo 'for fun, for no particular purpose'
which is normally used to cover this sense. (It would appear that the Gurindji
jupu 'only, just' occurs more regularly in this sense.) The two frequently occur
 together, as in
      (6-172) winhi woongooloo gardbiyiddorni
              only for:fun           we:fight:together
               'We're just fighting for fun (with no serious intent).'
This was elicited as an appropriate response to jaji-yoo gardbinggiddarni
(something-OAT you:lot:are:fighting) 'Why are you lot fighting?'.6.4.8 moorda 'completely'
Due to the paucity of examples, it is impossible to be certain of the exact
significance of this particle. The available examples show three main contextual
senses.
      (a) 'Whole, completely'. This sense normally occurs with reference to
swallowing something whole, without chewing:
      (6-173) gambayi -ngga      maa mangaddi binyjangnga moorda
              boy      ERG        meat not         he:chewed:it whole
              niyigbaddi
              he: swallowed:it
              'The boy didn't chew the meat, he swallowed it whole.'
              CI.AUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS                         507      (b) 'For no reason'. Moorda may suggest that the process referred to
occurred for no apparent reason. An example is (5-370) above. This sense may
also be enhanced by the use of winhi 'just, only' (in sense (d) of the previous
section):
     (6-174) winhi moorda        gardnginbini
             only no:reason you:hit:me
             'You hit me for no reason at all.'
Winhi 'just, only' and moorda 'completely' have apparently similar senses 'for no
real reason'. However, the English glosses here in fact conflate two quite distinct
senses: 'to engage in an action just for the sake of it', and 'to become engaged in
an action for no apparent reason'. The first is a contextual sense of winhi 'just,
only' contradicting the expectation that an individual would not normally do the
action without some purpose in view; the second, a contextualisation of moorda
'completely', contradicting the implicit assumption that the process would not
occur unless the actor intended to engage in it. The former is less than
expectation; the latter, greater than expectation. This may explain the
combination of the two in (6-174): 'just (for the sake of it) you hit me for no
reason (or cause)'.
      (c) 'By accident'. A closely related sense to the one just discussed is that the
process was not done intentionally: it just happened. (This does not cover the
full range of 'unintentional' in English.) For example:
     (6-175) mangaddi ngaoddi -yoo       moowla -nhi      moorda
             not          stone   DAT I:looked for:it by:accident
             gilbali
             I: found: it
             'Although I wasn't looking for money, I found some.'
      It seems likely that a single formal meaning can be identified as underlying
these three senses. Moorda 'completely' would appear to be a type of expectation
modifier, which indicates that the situation referred to is evaluated as greater than
expectation (in the sense of evaluation identified above). That is, in the symbols
used above, Assertion x >Expectation y. Thus swallowing food whole may be
evaluated as greater than expectation if there is no apparent reason for it, or if the
actor does not try to do it.
      Moorda 'completely' is then an inverse of winhi 'just, only', for which the
assertion is evaluated as less than the expectation. Furthermore, moorda
'completely' and the enclitic -ngaddaya TOO (see section 6.3.5) have identical
formal meanings, and differ only in scope: clausal vs. subclausal. For moorda
'completely', x andy in the formula of the previous paragraph are situations
508                        TOPICS IN SEMANTICS(expressed linguistically in clauses), whereas for -ngaddaya TOO they are
participants or circumstances (expressed linguistically in nominal phrases and
adverbials). We can now set up the following proportion:
      winhi : moorda :: -moowa : -ngaddaya6.4.9 wajanginyji and jinginyji 'but really'
Very little can be said about these two words, of which there are a couple of
instances only of each. In the few examples, wajanginyji and jinginyji have
approximate senses 'but really', and the clauses they modify follow clauses
modified by thaddi 'mistakenly believed', in a replacive clause complex (see
section 5.6.2.1). It is not clear, either, in what way the two lexemes differ
(assuming that they do differ). It proved impossible to systematically elicit
either word in this replacive construction: the contrast usually went unmarked -
as in example (6-146).
      Examples of usage of the two particles are:
      (6-176) nginyji -ga      -ngaddaya thaddi                manyi -yoo
              you       ERG TOO            mistakenly:believed food   DAT

              'I thought you too were looking for food, but really you were
                  looking for grog.'
      (6-177) thaddi                 migalimi -nganggi manyi -yoo
              mistakenly:believed !:thought of:you food       DAT

              'I thought you were looking for food, but it was really grog you
                  were looking for.'6.4.10 ngamoo 'before'
Ngamoo has a purely temporal meaning 'before, at an earlier time'. As has
already been mentioned, this word may fill one of two main roles in a clause:
Temporal Location, or Propositional Modifier.
     In the former role, ngamoo 'before' can indicate past either with respect to
the speech situation (which is the usual state of affairs), or with respect to an
event set up in the text. Examples are, respectively,
                 CLAUSEMODIFYJNG PARTICLES ANDADVERBIALS                          509         (6-178) ngamoo yoowooloo -moowa warangbiddi

                 'Before there were only Aborigines (here). •
         (6-179) manyi ngamoo giribali                  doowa

                 he:knocked:repeatedly on:me
                 'I was just finishing up my tea when he knocked at my door.'
           In its role as a Propositional Modifier, ngamoo 'before' normally translates
    as 'already':
         (6-180) ngamoo bijgoowayiddarni
                 before we:are:arriving
                 We're almost there.' (Literally, We're already arriving.')
    This sentence may be used to contradict an expectation that we were not nearing
    the destination, that is, an expectation that there was still a long way to go.
    {6-180) was elicited as appropriate to a context in which the speaker contradicts
    the hearer's belief that they still have some distance to travel. Here ngamoo
    'before' modifies the proposition bijgoowayiddarni 'we're getting there', and
    contrasts with mangaddi 'not', yiganyi 'uncertain', etc., not with other temporals
    such asjamoondoo 'the other day', etc. {cf. section 5.4.1).    6.4.11 yaningi 'now'
    Yaningi is a temporal adverbial which, like ngamoo 'before', may locate an
    event either with respect to the speech situation, in which case it means 'now',
    or with respect to another described event, in which case it means 'at the same
    time'. In its first use at least, the exact temporal expanse covered may vary
    considerably, depending on what 'now' is presumed to contrast with. It can mean
    anything from 'right now', 'at this very instant', 'now, any or all of the time
    from the beginning of the present speech situation to its end', 'today', to 'these
.   days (as opposed to the early days, etc.)' .
!
          Yaningi 'now' may also be used as a Propositional Modifier. For example,
    in
         {6-181) wamba -nyali marla -ya goorijga yaningi -nyali
                 later  REP hand LOC he:holds:it now      REP

             he:will:send:it
             'He's still got (the letter) in his hand, (but) he'll send it directly.'
                (Note: speaker's gloss used the term directly.)
it would seem that it is not taken for granted that the person concerned will post
the letter at all- perhaps he looks undecided about it. That is, yaningi 'now'
provides more than a temporal location for the process, and contrasts with e.g.
yiganyi 'uncertain', mangaddi 'not', and so on.6.4.12 yaniyaningi 'right now'
This word is clearly a partial reduplication of yaningi 'now', and has a formal
meaning predictable from this, 'right now, at the very time'. That is,
reduplication has the effect of intensification.
     Yaniyaningi 'right now' seems to occur only with extendible processes, or
with the progressive of accomplishments, and appears to usually suggest that
the process has just been entered into, as of the speech situation time (see
example (6-182)), or as of the time of the events described (see example (6-183):
      (6-182) yiwindi -ga     yaniyaningi -nyali gadgoowaanboo
              rain        ERG right:now    REP it:is:leaving
              giribaari
              it: is: finishing
              The rain is just starting to finish up now.'
      (6-183) manyi yaniyaningi ngabla doowa
              food    right:now I:ate:it ck>or
              gardbigardbinga        -ngadla
              he:knocked:it:repeatedly on:me
              'I had just started to eat when he knocked on the door.'
     In case the comparison is with respect to speech situation time,
yaniyaningi 'right now' seems to normally counter an expectation that the
process has not yet started, and for this reason appropriate English glosses may
involve 'already'. For example,
      (6-184) yaniyaningi thangarndi thigiwaari              giribjawidi
              right:now    wool        it:is:getting:short we:might:finish:it
              The cassette is already getting short; we'll be finishing up.'
was uttered in a context in which the speaker was surprised that the time had
             ClAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIAI.S                        511passed so quickly, and the cassette had almost run ouL
      Both yaniyaningi 'right now' and ngamoo 'before' (see section 6.4.10) may
be felicitously translated as 'already' in certain circumstances, with the
progressive aspect. The difference seems to be that whereas yaniyaningi 'right
now' suggests that the 'train' of progress has just started, ngamoo 'before'
suggests that it started some time ago. Thus the use of ngamoo 'before' in this
context gives the sense of greater immediacy or imminence of the attainment of
the accomplishment. Thus, (6-180) above makes a stronger claim than
     (6-185) mangaddi marnangooddoo yaniyaningi graaggoowayinmi
             not          far              right:now    we:are:nearing:it
             'It's not far now, we're already nearing (our destination).'6.4.13 wamba 'later'
The interpretation of this adverbial poses some difficulties. It would appear to
form the third member of a triplet with ngamoo 'before, an indefinite time in the
past', andyaningi 'now, an indefinite time including the present', to indicate 'an
indefinite time in the future'. The temporal reference point is usually the speech
situation time, and the VP usually occurs in the future tense, as the following
example shows.
     (6-186) wamba jalbawinggiddinya
             later    I:will:meet:you:pl
             'I will meet you lot later.'
      But, as is the case for ngamoo 'before' and yaningi 'now', another reference
point may be chosen, the time set up in the events described. I have been unable
to locate examples in which wamba 'later' is used in locating past events with
respect to one another (of the type illustrated in (6-179) and (6-183)). In (6-187)
and (6-188), however, the present event is located in the future with respect to
the understood or presupposed situations.
     (6-187) wamba -nyali waranggiri gamba -wini ngoorloogga
             later    REP he:sits          water IND he:drinks:it
             'He's probably still sitting there drinking.'
     (6-188) wamba -nyali mangaddi bijgoowaarni
             later      REP not             it:is:emerging
             'It (the island) still hasn't emerged (from the floodwaters).'
In (6-187) it was already established that the individual concerned had been
512                          TOPICS 1N SEMANTICSdrinking at an earlier time in the day (he had been seen), and in (6-188), it was
part of the common knowledge of everyone in the town that, as of recently, the
islands in the river were still under the floodwaters.
      The preceding two sentences do more than just locate the present situation
with respect to one presupposed in the past. By implication, continuity of the
present situation with the past is suggested, and wamba 'later' appears to be
functioning as a Propositional Modifier. The occurrence of wamba 'later', that is,
contradicts an explicit expectation that the situation located at the earlier time
might have ceased to obtain now. (Cf. the discussion of sense (v) of -nyali REP,
in section 6.3.2.) In this context, wamba 'later' usually translates into English
as 'still'.
      In fact, it would appear that this interpersonal usage of wamba 'later' is far
more frequent than the corresponding usage of ngamoo 'before' and yaningi
'now'. Whereas in (6-84) wamba 'later' provides a temporal location of the
situation, in (6-186), it is quite likely that the speaker is contradicting an
assumption that he will not be meeting the addressee later on.6.4.14 wambawoo 'nearly'
This particle occurs only with VPs in the potential mode, and indicates that
although the process did not actually occur, it very nearly did. For example,
      (6-189) wambawoo gardyanirni
              nearly       she:could:have:fallen
              'She nearly fell.'
described a situation in which a woman tripped over on a stick and very nearly
fell over. Gardyanirni 'she could have fallen' itself could be used to describe the
same situation (see section 6.5.3.2 below); but wambawoo 'nearly' suggests that
the process very nearly occurred, and that there was a strong expectation that it
would. The presence of the particle disambiguates the utterance from other
possible interpretations of the potential mode (section 6.5.3.2). In (6-189) it was
only at the last moment that the woman regained her balance. In the following
example, the speaker had expected to hit the kangaroo, but it got up in time:
      (6-190) wambawoo gardgooloonirni           niyi thiddoo bajgiwindi
              nearly        l:could:have:hit:it that kangaroo it:got:up
              'I very nearly hit it, but the kangaroo got up.'
The phonological shape of this particle suggests that it might be analysed into
wamba 'later', plus the definite mode enclitic -woo DEF. That this is not entirely
improbable finds some support in the possible English gloss for (6-189) 'Still,
               ClAUSE MODIFYING PARTICLES AND ADVERBIALS                        513
she could have fallen'. I cannot pursue the implications of this possibility here.6.4.15 yilba 'forever'
This particle indicates that either the process will continue indefinitely on into
the future, or its effects will. For example, to illustrate the rust sense,
       (6-191) warangjawingi yilba
               I:might:sit       forever
               'I'll be staying (here) for good.'
The second sense is illustrated in:
       (6-192) mangaddi gardbiddini      yilba
               not       they:hit:him forever
               'They didn't hit him for good (i.e. they didn't kill him).'
       (6-193) thinga gajbinmi        yilba
               foot    they:cut:him forever
               '(The doctors) cut his toe right off.'6.4.16 ngaddarni 'always•
Ngaddarni 'always' indicates that the process referred to occurs habitually; it can
usually be translated into English 'always':
       (6-194) gaddwaroo ngaddami bagingiri
               afternoon always        I:lie
               'I always sleep in the afternoon.'
      In section 6.5.1.2 it is shown that one of the senses of the present tense is
general or habitual action. The function of ngaddarni 'always' seems to be to
bring prominence to this facet of the proposition expressed. Usually, the plain
present tense is used to indicate habituality. It seems that ngaddarni 'always' is
used only when there is an expectation to the contrary, an expectation that the
proposition may not be a universal truth. For example, in the context in which
(6-194) was elicited, there was an expectation that the speaker might be available
for an interview some afternoon. Thus it appears that ngaddarni 'always' is
fulfilling the interpersonal role of Propositional Modifier in examples like
(6-194).
      The idea 'never' is not lexicalised in Gooniyan~i. but may be expressed by
placing a negated clause within the scope of ngaddarni 'always' (i.e. 'always not
P'):
514                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICS      (6-195) ngaddarni mangaddi bijbiyaniila         goomboorna
              always     not        I:frequently:come early
              'I never come early.'6.4.17 ngambiddi 'again'
Ngambiddi 'again' is a particle which can usually be glossed 'again'. It indicates
that the situation referred to by the clause is a repetition of an earlier situation;
formula (6-69) describes its meaning. Ngambiddi 'again' contrasts in a number of
interrelated ways with the enclitic -nyali REP, which may sometimes be glossed
'again' (see section 6.3.2):
      (i) The particle is a clause level particle, and indicates the repetition of the
full situation, whereas -nyali REP indicates the repetition of part of a situation
only. There are no examples of the 'back to a former place or position' sense
with ngambiddi 'again'. In saying that the full situation is repeated, I do not
mean to suggest that it must be repeated in all its aspects. But, as a rule, the
same participants are involved in each instance. The only exception I am aware
of it when reference is made to a generic, not an individual participant, as in
      (6-196) nganyi nyagginboowoo ngambiddi. -nyali
              I        he:will:spear:me again  REP
              'I might be speared again.'
      (6-197) ngambiddi. -nyali wayandi jardli
              again           REP fire  I:lit:it
              'I lit a fire again.'
      (ii) Unlike -nyali REP, ngambiddi 'again' appears never to have an
interpersonal sense in which the time T of formula (6-69) is speech situation
time.
      (iii) Being a full word, ngambiddi 'again' may become either the Theme or
the Focus of a clause, possibilities denied to the enclitic -nyali REP. This
property is crucial in two contexts: where it is desired to indicate that a situation
will 'not occur again', and to indicate 'again not'.
      (6-198) mangaddi ngambiddi giddagiddayidi

              'Then they ate meat, no longer under the taboo.'
(Cf. pages 387-388 above.) As shown by (6-198), -nyali REP never occurs
when ngambiddi 'again' is in the scope of mangaddi 'not' (cf. discussion of sense
(i) in section 6.3.2 above).6.4.18 briyandi •in revenge'
This adverbial indicates that the action was done in return for, or as revenge for,
some other action by a different actor. That is, the action was done to redress a
balance. Examples are (6-34) and (6-35) above. Occasionally briyandi 'in
revenge' is followed by the locative postposition -ya, in which case it indicates
that a number of successive events were done each in return for the preceding.
Examples are:

     and the classifier +I, although it is not possible in this case to uniquely segment
     the form- see section 3.9.3.2.4 below.)
          The intermediate ranks of phrase and word have been introduced in order to
     account for the possibility of branching: in Figure 3-2, in each case in which a

    branching is possible at that point. That is, the function that this constituent
    has is realised, or could be realised by a unit with internal structure. (Other
    changes - e.g. to the person/number ""agreement"" in the verbal complex -
    may be necessary to preserve grammaticality.) For example, the word waba-
    'smell' in (3-1) realises the function of Process in the phrase of which it is a
    constituent, and this may be realised by bimorphemic constructions such as
    gard-bi- (hit-IT) 'belt'.
          There are, however, certain linguistic units that cannot be placed on the
    rank scale. This includes a number of words which may occur directly as
    constituents of clauses, and a number of morphemes which occur as phrasal
    constituents, without intervening phrase and word nodes respectively. This holds
    true for the word mangaddi 'not' in example (3-3), and the morphemes -yooddoo
    DU and -jidda ALL in (3-2), and -ngga ERG in (3-3), as is shown in the
    constituent analyses of figures 3-3 and 3-4.

       -Yooddoo DU and -jidda ALL in Figure 3-2, and -ngga ERG in Figures 3-3
and 3-4, have bypassed the word level, while mangaddi 'not' in Figure 3-3 has
bypassed both phrase and word levels. This is because in these instances there is
no possibility of branching between the morpheme level and the next one up:
these morphemes do not enter into syntagms with other morphemes, to form
grammatical words. Because of this, I do not refer to forms such as mangaddi
'not', even though they are free forms, as grammatical words (see also below
section 3.1.2).
       We have now identified two types of unit: ranking and non-ranking. It
turns out that, in Gooniyandi, all form items (Matthews 1981:59) are non-
ranking, and conversely, the majority of non-ranking units are form items. The
only exceptions are the adverbials, which are non-ranking units (section 3.2),
but are not form items. With the exception of adverbials, all non-ranking units
are form items, and must occur in construction with ranking units. The resulting
syntagm is typically a unit of the same rank as the ranking unit (as is the case
in the preceding two examples above) - although sometimes it does not
constitute a unit at all (see below section 3.8).
       One further qualification is necessary: certain clauses may consist only of a
single morpheme, usually an interjection - e.g. yoowayi 'yes' (see below
3.10). Evidently these are ""minor"" clauses, and might reasonably be placed off
the rank scale: they never have internal structure. In this case ""clause"" and
""morpheme"" coincide.
       There are two main ways in which trees can become more complicated.
Firstly, as Figures 3-3 and 3-4 show, embedding is possible. In these particular
examples the embedded unit is of the same rank as the unit it is embedded in.
However, rankshifting (Huddleston 1965:45) - which is a special type of
-
                                PRELIMINARY REMARKS                                133
    embedding in which the unit embedded is of higher rank than the unit in which
    it is embedded - is also possible, albeit rare and of limited productivity in
    Gooniyandi (see below 4.1.2.1 and 5.5). The maximum depth of embedding
    attested in my corpus is three, as in the following configuration:
                                            PP
                                        A p
                                       NP                                  pp
                                     A (N)
                                A
                               NP1     P1
         Here NP 1 cannot have another phrase embedded within it (see section 4.2).
    Furthermore, when the embedding also involves rankshifting, the maximum
    depth appears to be one: if a unit of higher rank is embedded under a unit of
    lower rank, then no unit can be embedded within the embedded unit
         The second complication is that units (typically of the same rank) may
    form syntagms that are not units of the next highest rank. For instance,
            (3-4) garndiwiddi yoowooloo yoowarni goornboo
                  two         man       one      woman
                  'two men and one woman'
    consists of two phrases, [garndiwiddi yoowooloo] 'two men' and [yoowarni
    goornboo] 'one woman', each of which has the characteristic structure of an NP.
    The structure of the whole is clearly not that of an NP - it cannot be described
    in terms of the functions identified for the NP (see section 4.1.2.1), although its
    two constituents can be. Neither is it a clause. Constructions such as these will
    be referred to as complexes, following Huddleston (1965). There are, in
    Gooniyandi, word complexes, phrase complexes and clause complexes; in
    addition, certain complexes of words and phrases occur. (It is also possible that
    there are morpheme complexes.)    3.1.2     Types of word
    It is necessary to distinguish four different types of word in Gooniyandi. Firstly
    there is the phonological word, which is as described in the previous chapter. A
    second type of word is the grammatical word- abbreviated g-word- which is
    a grammatical unit of word rank; that is, it is the smallest unit that can have
    constituency structure. This unit was introduced in the previous subsection.
134                                  TilE WORD      It is necessary to distinguish the g-word from the lexical word, the third
type of word, for which I will sometimes also use the term ""lexeme"". Lexemes
are those items which are listed in the dictionary. I include here both morphemes
of all types and certain larger, word-like units which are constructions of
morphemes; but I will exclude idiomatic collocations. The larger unit may be
either an inflectional form of one of the constituent morphemes, the root, or it
may constitute a distinct lexical item, a stem. On the whole, Gooniyandi shows
little inflection. Most of the inflection which does occur is found in the verbal
classifier complex, discussed in section 3.9.3.2 below. A small amount of
inflection is found elsewhere, in pronominals and some spatial adverbials. The
various forms of these words are not readily analysable into constituent
morphemes. For example, nginyji 'you (sg)' and ngaanggi 'yours (sg)' are two
forms of the lexeme ""second person singular"", but neither is amenable to
morphemic analysis (see section 3.6).
       Fourthly, there are distributional words, abbreviated d-words, which are free
forms having the property that they cannot be divided into units each of which is
free. Any utterance consists of a whole number of d-words; these are the
minimal forms that may be permuted, the permutations preserving
grammaticality. Constituents of d-words are in general not permutable.
Postpositions (see section 3.7) are the only exceptions: they may be attached to
any g-word in a nominal phrase. For example, (3-5) consists of three d-words,
all orders of which are possible:
      (3-5) nganyi -ngga manyi muri -fa        -wila        -nganggi
            I          ERG food      go   SUBJ I:will:do:it for:you
            'I'll bring you food.'
       But the parts of the words cannot be permuted either within, or amongst
the separate words: -ngga ERG, for example, could not be attached to manyi
'food', nor could it occur anywhere in the verbal d-word.
       D-words may be bounded by pauses, but it is only under exceptional
circumstances that pauses occur within d-words. For example, at the end of my
first field trip, having spent a full hour giving me person, number and tense
forms of verbs, my teacher finally began to tire of the task, and pauses occurred
between the verbal stem and the following classifier complex. However, during
these pauses the articulatory organs did not go back to their rest position, but
were held in place until the form was recalled and the d-word could be completed.
When the pause became too long, or the articulators were not held in place,
renewed attempts always started again at the beginning of the d-word. In these
-
                                    PARTS-OF-SPEECH                               135
    sessions of intensive elicitation of the verbal paradigm I was never given just
    the paradigmatically significant piece, the classifier complex; I was always given
    the full form with the initial lexical item. In the entire body of texts I recorded
    there are no more than a handful of instances in which there is a perceptible
    pause within ad-word. Where they occur, these pauses always coincide with
    morpheme boundaries, and appear to usually occur when the speaker is suffering
    from a momentary lapse in memory or concentration.
          Although single d-words could be elicited and discussed in isolation -
    native speakers of Gooniyandi were willing to explain their meaning to me -
    smaller items could not be. Smaller items such as bound morphemes did not
    seem to have psychological reality, and were not identified on the few occasions
    when, for one reason or another, I cited them in isolation. (They were, however,
    immediately identified in retrospect once I provided an example in a d-word.)
          The four types of word we have identified do not always coincide in
    Gooniyandi. However, some correlations can be made between them. Every g-
    word consists of one or more lexemes, but not every lexeme is a g-word. For
    example, mangaddi 'no, not' is a lexeme, but not a g-word (it is not a ranking
    item). And distinct g-words may be instantiations of a single lexeme. This is the
    case for pronominals, which show two distinct case forms. Every d-word
    consists of a whole number of phonological words and a whole number of
    lexemes; moreover it consists of either a whole number of, or zero g-words. A
    phonological word normally consists of a whole number of lexical words, and a
    whole number of, or zero g-words. Exceptions arise within the verbal d-word,
    where the two obligatory lexical g-words (the verbal stem and the classifier
    complex) which typically constitute separate phonological words, may become
    fused together in such a way that the boundary of the phonological word shifts
    forward (see section 2.5.3 above). In most of the remainder of this chapter, I will
    be referring to phonological words only in passing. The other three types arise
    more frequently, and are more easily confused; I will therefore normally use the
    more explicit labels to make the reference clear.","[115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120]"
"1.9 Other work on Gooniyandi
Previous to my investigations, very little linguistic work had been done on
Gooniyandi, and there are only scattered references to the language in the
literature. (See McGregor 1984a (a copy of which has been lodged in the
A.I.A.S.library) and 1988e for lists of the major references to the language.)
      The first written reference to Gooniyandi appears in Bates (nd), which is a
compilation of wordlists in languages from the Kimberley region, collected by
various local white residents around the turn of the century. This manuscript
contains a wordlist in the Warranarrie (presumably a mis-hearing of Waringaddi
'many people') language compiled by C.J. Annear. The majority of words are
clearly Gooniyandi, and on the whole they are reasonably well transcribed.
      Capell (1940:416-418) gives a short list of nineteen words, all but two of
which are identifiable and reasonably accurately transcribed. He also provides a
part of the present tense paradigm of the verb ward- 'go' (Capell 1940:416).
However, most of the forms given are inaccurate: the plural marker ge (-/gil)
given for the first person non-singular forms is found in Bunuba only, and most
instances of word final/i/ have been mistranscribed as /a/ (cf. 2.1.6.1 below). To
                         afHER WORK ON GOONIYANDI                                 29the best of my knowledge this is the only published data on Gooniyandi (prior
to my own work). Capell (1940:244) was the first linguist to correctly identify
Bunuba and Gooniyandi as members of a single language group, referring to
them as ""prefixing languages without noun classification"". The linguistic
surveys of O'Grady, V oegelin, and Voegelin (1966:78), Oates and Oates {1970),
and Wurm (1972) repeat Capell's remarks without adding anything new.
      Worms apparently did a little field work on Gooniyandi in the thirties or
forties (Worms 1953:960). However, virtually nothing about the language
appears in Nekes and Worms' monumental Australian languages (Nekcs and
Worms 1953), and Worms wrongly typologised it as a SUFFIXING northern
Kimberley language (Worms 1953:961), despite Capell (1940).
      In 1953 the anthropologist Norman Tindale collected a vocabulary of about
a hundred or so basic terms in Gooniyandi (Tindale 1952-1954). All but a couple
of his terms are readily identified, and most are reasonably accurately transcribed.
The main inaccuracy is that he misses many lamina-dental and retroflexed stops
and nasals, most of which he transcribes as apico-alveolars.
      The next linguist to record Gooniyandi seems to be Father Anthony Piele,
who in about 1960 recorded, but did not transcribe, an hour or so of Gooniyandi
words.
      By far the best and most extensive early work on Gooniyandi is
undoubtedly that done by the missionary-linguist Howard Coate in the mid-
1960s. Coate worked for a short time with the Fossil Downs ""mob""; the Kija
bias in the lexicon is evident (see section 1.3). He elicited a number of words,
and recorded and transcribed some excellent and valuable texts (totaling about
forty minutes in duration), traditional and historical, all told by a very
knowledgeable old man (Fossil Pluto), since deceased, who is still remembered
as an expertjalngangooddoo 'doctor'- i.e. person knowledgeable in traditional
Aboriginal law and ritual. Coate has generously made his material available to
me, and because of the value of the texts, I have retranscribed them, hopefully
more accurately.
      Coate's transcription was quite accurate, except that (1) He did not always
distinguish the lamina-dental stop /th/ and nasal /nh/, which he usually wrote as
apico-alveolar /d/ and /n/ respectively. This distinction is, in fact, very difficult
for the English speaker to hear, and it is quite likely that there are some such
mistranscriptions in the present work. And (2) he took the mid vowels [e] and
[o], which are allophones of /if and /oo/ respectively to be distinct phonemes.
Coate undertook some grammatical analysis, but did not publish any of his
findings. His analysis is good, as far as it goes, and considering the very short
30                             INTRODUCTIONtime he spent on the language. He correctly identified the free pronominal forms
-but he sometimes confused yaadi 'we unrestricted (=we plural inclusive)' as
'we plural exclusive' - and his verbal paradigms are reasonably accurate, though
incomplete. There are just a few unidentified forms in Coate's corpus, some of
 which may perhaps be Kija: for example, mangany 'no, not' (mangaddi and
 marlami in Gooniyandi), and -ningi 'to him/her/it' (-nhi in Gooniyandi).
       In the mid- to late nineteen seventies two academic linguists, namely Alan
 Rumsey and Tasaku Tsunoda, recorded small amounts of Gooniyandi; both have
 kindly made their recordings available to me. Working with Bunuba bilinguals
 in Fitzroy Crossing, Rumsey collected a short word list of around a hundred
 items for the purposes of lexical comparison; Rumsey's list, of course, shows
 some Bunuba influence. Tsunoda recorded four or five hours of words and
 sentences at Margaret River station with speakers of the easternmost variety of
 Gooniyandi (see section 1.3). This is the only material available in this
 maximally divergent variety.
        In the last decade two SIL linguists have been involved in more practical
 work on the language. In 1978 Carol Morris, in collaboration with a speaker of
 Gooniyandi who was fully literate in English, David Street, produced a short
 dictionary of a few hundred entries, on the whole accurately transcribed. Morris
 recognised the phonemic distinctiveness of the lamino-dentals, but, like Coate,
 took the mid vowels [e] and [o] to be phonemically contrastive. And, as
 mentioned in the preceding section, in 1983 Joyce Hudson produced some
 Gooniyandi literacy materials, and published a few articles on the orthography
 which she designed in collaboration with Street and Chestnut. Most of the words
 appearing in these works are accurately written in the Hudson-Street-Chestnut
 orthography, although there are a few instances of mistranscription of lamino-
 dentals as apico-alveolars, and some phonetically long, but phonemically short
  vowels are mistranscribed as long.
        A number of anthropological studies have at least touched on the
  Gooniyandi people, and a couple of them include some Gooniyandi words (for a
  list of these works, see McGregor 1984a). The most recent study is Kolig
  (1981), who cites a number of identifiably Gooniyandi words; these are not
  accurately transcribed. Moreover, Kolig generally does not identify these terms
  as Gooniyandi, nor does he distinguish them from terms in the other languages
  of the Fitzroy Crossing region.","[41, 42, 43]"
"3.12.3 Adverbial word formation
3.12.3.1 Adverbial stem forming suffixes
There are two suffixed morphemes which appear to form stems of the adverbial
class. They are:
[1] -wa. This suffix, which must be distinguished from the nominal stem
forming suffix -wa 'his' (see page 234), is found attached to nominals,
adverbials, and, most frequently, verbals. When suffixed to words of the latter
category, the initial {w} is subject to VR6 (and subsequently to VR5, if
applicable). That is, -wa MD is realised by /gal following non-continuant
consonants, as in e.g. barnga- (retum-MD), and by /a/ following vowels, in
which case VR5 applies to convert the resulting sequence of vowels to long /aa/,
as in waraa- (stand-MD - wara- 'stand'), bagaa- (lie-MD - bagi- 'lie'). (There
are no examples available of -wa following a continuant consonant.) When
sufftxed to nominals and adverbials (vowel final in all available examples), -wa
is realised as either /wa/ or becomes /aa/ with the preceding vowel. For example,
both /migawa/ and /migaa/ 'that way, that direction' (from miga 'that mode')
occur. The /wa/ form usually occurs in careful speech only.
      The meaning and uses of this suffix are not understood well, but it appears
to describe a 'way' or 'mode' of being or action- hence the gloss MD (mode).
Some examples of -wa have already been given (in section 3.4.3) in the side/end
forms of the cardinal adverbials, where it was suggested that forms such as
booddoonggoowa 'on the north side or end of might be understood as 'the mode
or aspect to the north (of a body)'. Similarly, the adverbials wilajga 'around' and
maddajga 'past' are obviously adverbialisations of the verbals wilaj- 'go around'
(giving 'mode of being around') and maddaj- 'pass' (giving 'mode of being past').
      Other examples include: migawa 'that way, in that direction' (see page 153
above and example (3-26)); thiddgirliwa (from thiddgirli 'straight') which
indicates, as shown in (3-128), a straight mode of 'being' for the words in the
246                               1HEWORDspeaker's brain; and giningiwa (from giningi 'breath, life force') which indicates,
in (3-129), the 'way' of dying, i.e. by exhaustion.
      (3-128) garndiwangooddoo thangarndi thiddgirli -wa         milyilyi -ngga

              water    DAT breath        MD they:are:dying
              'They (the bullocks) are dying of thirst.'
For a discussion of the combination of -wa with verbal roots, see section
5.5.1.3.
[2] -wadda. The initial (w) of this morpheme, like the initial segment of -wa
MD, is realised by /g/ following non-continuant consonants, as in widdinygadda
(whistle-MNR), and by zero elsewhere- i.e. following vowels and continuants
- irrespective of the class of the word to which it is suffixed. Examples are
nardaadda (cry-MNR) and galgaladda (laugh-MNR). These altemant shapes can be
accounted for under the assumption that -wadda does not bear inherent stress, and
is subject to VR6. It must also be assumed that VRS applies to convert the
sequences /i-a/ and /u-a/ to /aa/, as in bagaadda (lie-MNR - bagi- 'lie').
      The exact meaning of this morpheme - which may be attached to
nominals, adverbials and verbals, though most frequently to the latter (see
section 5.5.1.4 for a discussion of this combination) -remains unclear. The
most that I am able to say with any degree of confidence is that -wadda appears
to indicate a manner of action characteristic of the actor's performance
throughout the process; this is an 'active' manner, by contrast with the type of
'mode' or 'way' of being or action expressed by -wa - see particularly examples
(3-128) and (3-129) above. Examples of -wadda MNR are (3-21) above, in which
-wadda is attached to an adverb, and
      (3-130) wangmadda .afd:.z   wardji
              mad          MNR he:went
              'He walked along madly.'
in which -wadda MNR is attached to a nominal.
The facts of allomorphy and of meaning suggest the segmentation of -wadda into
the -wa morpheme discussed immediately above, followed by -dda. However, -dda
does not occur elsewhere, and I regard -wadda as a single distinct morpheme in the
                              WORD FORMATION                                  247
present-day language.
      A morpheme -karra (-gadda) or -warra (-wadda) with a similar meaning is
found in Jaru (Tsunoda 1981:241-242), Gurindji (Tsunoda 1981:241-242), and
Walmajarri (Hudson 1978:35). There is some evidence that -wadda is a stem
formative in Gooniyandi, as is -karra in Jaru, according to Tsunoda (1981:241-
242). This evidence consists of the fact that mayaadda (hard-wadda) is partially
reduplicated in the word mayaaddayaadda 'hard, energetically' (see above page
154), which suggests that the former is a stem, and secondly from the fact that
-wadda may be followed by the ERG postposition- see example (5-266) below.
(By way of contrast, Hudson 1978:35) regards the corresponding Wahnajarri
morpheme as a case suffix.)
      There are a couple of adverbials which, although apparently synchronically
unanalysable roots, appear to involve -wadda MNR as a formative. An example
is wandaadda 'single file'. To the best of my knowledge, wanda does not occur as
a root; however, this form does also occur (with a clearly related meaning) in
wandamaddi 'side by side' (-maddi is not a morpheme). It is possible that the
adverb barnbadda 'quickly' contains -wadda in the form /adda/ (or even /badda/-
in Jaru -parra is an allomorph of -karra {Tsunoda 1981:241)).","[230, 231, 232]"
"      The intonation contour of a segmented Theme is, on rare occasions,
falling, as it is on the adverbial ngamoo 'before' in

                TilE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OFTIIE ClAUSE                     375The significance of the conttast between rising and falling contours is unclear.
However, the falling intonation seems to be associated with a Theme that is not
initial in the sentence, as is the case in (5-231)- cf. Kilham (1977:89).
      Qualifying material may be interpolated (on its own intonation contour)
between a segmented Theme and the remainder of the clause. Such interpolated
material always occurs on a secondary and falling tone unit. An example is
     (5-232) maja I babligaj -joo maja I az           alex scott I
             boss     pub       OAT boss       ah
             migami -ngadda I
             he:told to:me
             'The boss, the publican, Alex Scott, he told me.'
      Following Grimes (1975) I will use the term REPRISE in reference to the
pattern in which a Theme is segmented and placed in its own information unit,
and, which in addition, is referred to (usually) by one of the endophoric
determiners niyaji 'this' and niyi 'that'. In this construction, the endophoric
determiner always occurs initially in the second primary information unit. For
example,
     (5-233) wajaddi -nhingi mawoolyi jirliwa -jangi I niyaji
             boab     ABL     Iittle:bits sinew  SEM this

             'The fibres from the boab tree they rub on their legs (to make
                twine).'
As this example shows, reprise is normally used when the Theme is longer than
usual (NPs of three words are rare). Compare
     (5-234) az . . . ngoorndoo yoowooloo niyi I wamba I
             ah       someone      man        that   later

                 Downs. He pull ... .'
In fact, thematic reprise most frequently occurs in order to summarise full
clauses, as in line (75) of Text 1. (See section 5.6.2.2.2 below for further
discussion.)
     Occasionally the usual ThemeARheme order appears to be reversed, with
what would appear to be the Rheme followed by what would appear to be the
Theme. In these circumstances, the apparent Theme always occurs on its own
information unit, as in the following examples:
      (5-235) booroowanbiddi laandi I yaddbanyi yoowooloo I
              they:were:hiding up        initiate  man
             'They were hiding up, the initiates.'

                         too
              We dug a hole for him, everyone, the stockmen too.'
I will refer to this construction as TAGGING, following Grimes (1975). Tagging
normally serves the function of reminding the hearer of the identity of the
Theme or of making its identity explicit, in case there is a chance of ambiguity.
In either case, the tagged phrase typically refers to something already mentioned
in the text, or present in the extralinguistic context. This is the case for the two
immediately preceding examples. The tagged unit serves a function of
clarification or explication.
       The tagging construction does not, I claim, contradict the ""theme first""
principle. It can be reasonably assumed that the Theme has been ellipsed, being
treated as given. Tagging it indicates that the speaker has changed his/her mind
at this point in the production of the text. The speaker now decides to treat the
information as not given, or at least as requiring some form of elaboration.
(Note that tagged constituents occur on secondary tone units with falling pitch;
this is characteristic of qualifying information units, as in (5-194) above.)
       In the examples so far the Theme has usually been a simple clausal
constituent, either a nominal phrase (NP or PP), or an adverbial. In one
                  THE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE ClAUSE                         377example, namely (5-227), the Theme was a complex of such units. Word
complexes and phrase complexes of all types (see section 4.3 above) can be
thematic. However, it is not clear that the Theme must always be realised by a
grammatical unit or a complex of grammatical units. Consider, for example,
(5-237):
      (5-237) yingi ... number six I gardiya               -ngga
              name                          white:people ERG
              goowajgoodda I six furlong I niyaji -yangga
              they:call:it                        this    ABLz
              booloodooddwinmi yawarda I garndiwangooddoo I
              they:started:off      horse      many
              '(The spot) called six furlongs - what white people call it is six
                 furlongs - from there they started off, all the horses.'
 The second clause in this example is divided into two information units, the first
 of which has the rising pitch associated with segmented Themes, and consists of
 an ERG PP and a VP. As the translation suggests, this clause has a natural
 interpretation as a WH-cleft. These two facts suggest that the sequence
 gardiyangga goowajgoodda 'white people call it' is a good candidate for Theme.
        The constituent realising the Theme of a clause usually realises at the same
 time some other role in the clause (or part thereof), experiential or interpersonal.
 There is one exception to this, in which the thematic element has an entirely
 textual role. The d-words niyinhingi (that-ABL) 'after that, from there',
niyajinhingi (this-ABL) 'after this', and migaya (thus-LOC) 'at that time' are
 frequently used as conjunctive elements. The first two are sentential
conjunctions (see for instance lines (49) and (79) of Text 1, and line (3) of Text
3); the third normally conjoins clauses within a single sentence. These
connecting words are almost always thematic, providing a 'starting point' for the
clause/sentence.
       The interpersonal role Propositional Modifier, which is realised by
particles and temporal adverbials (see next section), frequently combines with the
textual role of Theme. For examples see (5-216) above and next section. Some
Particles such as mangaddi 'no, not' are invariably thematic; others, including
yiganyi 'uncertain' need not be, although they usually are. If not thematic, they
are typically focal.
       The experiential role of Actor (see section 5.2.1.3 above) is statistically
the most frequent choice of Theme in situation clauses. In non-situation clauses
it is the thing characterised or identified that is the preferred choice of Theme.
378                                 THE CLAUSEBut all other participant and circumstantial roles appear to have the potential of
being thematic. As yet I am unable to distinguish among the possibilities as to
their relative markedness as Theme choices.
      The major unresolved problem is whether the VP, which frequently occurs
clause initially, may be thematic, and if so, in what sense. When a VP occurs
initially, it is always the case (at least in the texts investigated to date) that there
is an established (and therefore given) participant in the register of the text which
is a candidate for ellipsed Theme. A typical example is the second clause in line
(8) of Text 2: here the Agent participants have been established in the preceding
text. A second circumstance in which VPs frequently occur initially is in
constructions of the type mentioned earlier (page 364) in which a clause
amplifies or elaborates the preceding one. One use of this construction is to
allow unmarked focus to fall (in successive clauses) on each item of news. For
example,
      (5-238) niyaji -ya I gamba -ga         gardbinbini I
              this      LOC water ERG it:hit:them
              gardbinbini gamba -ngga I yoowarni giddami I
              it:hit:them water ERG           one        he:ran
              'There it rained on them; they were rained on, and one of them ran
                  away.'
The reverse order seems to never occur: the VPANPJPP clause never precedes the
NP/PPAVP one. There are, then, no examples in which a VP initial clause
occurs in a context in which some participant is not given, and consequently the
VP is a good candidate for (ellipsed) Theme of the clause. It is possible that
initial VPs in clauses such as (5-235) and (5-236) above are thematic in the
other sense - i.e. they are starting point Themes.
VPs do sometimes occur in circumstances such as:
      (5-239) bagiyi niyaji -ya I bagiyi middi bijngarni -nhi I
              he:lay this      L0C he:lay sun         it:emerged on:him
               'He camped there. He lay until dawn.'
Here bagiyi 'he lay' serves as a thematic conjunction. It is suggested that rather
than the VP bagiyi 'he lay' being a conjunction in the clause middi bijngarninhi
:the sun r?s~ on him', the VP is the sole constituent of an elliptical clause which
ts themattc m a clause complex (formed by the constituents in the second tone
unit). See sections 5.6.2.1.3 and 5.6.2.2 below.","[358, 359, 360, 361, 362]"

                      might thus be regarded as fractured NPs (see section 4.2 above).
                      The lack of contrast between phrase and clause at the level of form has led some
                      linguists to suggest that verbless clauses in other Australian languages resembling
                      Gooniyandi consist of just single NPs - see e.g. (Dixon 1972:71). There are a
                      number of reasons against this hypothesis as regards Gooniyandi. Firstly,
                      propositional modifiers (which include markers of negation, probability, and so
                      on - see section 5.4.1) mark the nexus between the two constituents by their
                      position:
                            (5-18) ngirndaji gili       mangaddi binyidi
                                    this        same not           hard
                                    'This is not hard (ground).'
                      Secondly, reversal of the order of the two joined constituents does not have a
                      semantic effect identical with that of reordering the constituents of the
                      corresponding NP. And thirdly, only the Attribute, and not the whole
                      characterising clause may realise the function of Process in a clause.
                            A large number of different relations of attribution may be distinguished on
                      intuitive grounds, including size, shape, colour, appearance, age, value, texture,
                      sex etc .. This range is almost identical with the range of relations found between
                      the Entity and its Qualifier in the NP. The most significant difference is that
                      determiners and number words, which often function as Qualifiers in NPs, do
                      not occur as Attributes in characterising clauses.
                            Sometimes an intensive Attribute (but not a circumstantial or possessive
                      Attribute) may take a circumstance as a type of complement. There appear to be
                      two main possibilities. (a) It may be a circumstance of Matter (on which see
                      section 5.2.3.8), as illustrated in:
                           (5-19) NPl [nganyi]NPl NP2[binaddl1NP2 pp[niyaji -yoo ]pp
                                       I                knowledgeable this        DAT
                                  'I know that.' (Literally, 'I'm knowledgeable in respect of that.')
                      (b) Alternatively, it may be a circumstance of Cause (see section 5.2.3.6). For
                  example,
                           (5-20) bidi -yarndi thiddi -mili gamba -nhingi
                                  they PL       wild     CHAR water ABL
                                  'They're argumentative from grog.'
                  [2] Circumstantial. A circumstantial attribute provides an extrinsic
                  qualification of a thing in tenns of its relationship to other things or places in
                  the world, rather than describe a property of quality inherent to the thing. There
                  are two main differences between intensive and circumstantial characterising
                  clauses. Firstly, in circumstantial clauses the Attribute is conflated with a
        I   •   ~    '        i .•~-                                  •1
                                       302                                THE CLAUSE                                       circumstantial role, and so is realised by PPs or Adverbials, not NPs as in
                                       intensive clauses. Secondly, only for intensive circumstantial clauses are there
                    I .
                                       agnate situation clauses in which the Process takes the form of the Attribute.
.           !',:
                                       It should be noted that there is considerable formal overlap between the
    ,       I            ·'   1        expression classes that realise circumstantial and intensive Attributes, and there is
                                       potential ambiguity in many clause-forms. For instance,
                                             (5-21) niyaji goornboo jiginya -ngaddi
                                                     this     woman       child    COMIT
                                       is ambiguous between the senses 'This woman is with child (i.e. is pregnant)'
                                       (intensive), and 'This woman has a child' (circumstantial). The first, intensive
                                       reading arises if jiginyangaddi 'with (a) child' realises the Qualifier role in the NP
                                       realising the Attribute, in which case it belongs to an expression class which
                                       includes badiji 'pregnant', nyamani 'big', etc .. The second, circumstantial reading
                                       arises when the PP jiginya-ngaddi 'child-COMIT' directly realises the clausal role
                                       of Attribute, when it belongs to an expression class which includes thadda-ngaddi
                                       'dog-COMIT' 'with a dog', etc..
                                             Five types of circumstantial characterising clause are distinguishable by the
                                       postposition that occurs on the NP functioning as Attribute; the circumstantial
                                       roles correspond with those found in other clause types (see section 5.2.3). We
                                       deal with the five types in order.
                                       (a) Locational. In this clause type a location is attributed of an entity; the
                                       clause asserts that the entity is at a particular location. The Attribute may be
                                       realised by a LOC PP, by a locational adverbial, or by a complex the two.
                                       Examples of the three possibilities in order are:
                                             (5-22) ngaddagi tkldda ngirndaji -ya
                                                    my       dog      this     LOC
                                                    'My dog is here.'
                                             (5-23) garndiwiddi girli warlibiddi baabiddi
                                                    two          same river          below
                                                    'The two rivers are below (the surface of the billabong).'
                                             (5-24) ngaddagi ngaaddi gilirni -ya       babaabiddi
                                                     my      stone grass           LOC inside
                                                     'My money is in the grass.'
                                             Locational characterising clauses are fairly rare; the preferred pattern is for
                                       locations to be attributed of entities within situation clauses. This presumably
                                       correlates with the rarity of locative expressions as Qualifiers in NPs.
                                       (b) Purpose. This type attributes of an entity another entity or process with
,_ •   r   "" .. !It·~~   •          -
                                                    THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION                             303
                             which it is implicated as a purpose, function, or beneficiary. Purposive
                             Attributes are realised by OAT PPs:
                                   (5-25) thangarla moonyjoo -yoo ligidd -woo
                                          toothbrush tooth         OAT clean DAT
                                          'A toothbrush is for cleaning teeth.'
                                   Unlike locational Attributes, purposive Attributes always occur in
                             characterising clauses, and purposive expressions (DAT PPs) are often found as
                             Qualifiers in NPs. Purposive Attributes are sometimes formally
                             indistinguishable from possessive Attributes. But the distinction always shows
                             up when the beneficiary/possessor is a personal pronoun. The pronoun (in
                             oblique form) must be followed by the OAT Postposition in purposive
                             Attributes, as shown in (5-26), but not in possessive Attributes.

                             (c) Associative. The associative Attribute ascribes to an entity an association
                             with another entity, and is realised by a COMIT PP. An example is the second
                             sense of (5-21) above. Clauses with an associative Attribute generally translate
                             into English as 'x has y', or 'xis withy'.
                             (d) Comparative. Here the attributive relation takes the form of a comparison,
                             and the Attribute is realised by a phrase in constituency with the enclitic -jangi
                             SEM. For example,
                                  (5-27) goornboo ngooddoo yoowooloo -jangi
                                         woman that            man    SEM
                                         'That woman is like a man.'
                                  (5-28) [charlie -yoo manilll [[bill -yoo] -jangz]

                                         'Charlie's nose is like Bill's.'
                             (Note that in (5-28) the PP Bill-yoo 'in respect of Bill' realises a Deictic role in
                             an NP whose Entity (manili 'nose') has been ellipsed.)
                             (e) Source. The source Attribute ascribes an origin to an entity, and is realised
                             by an ABL1 PP. Even when a ""direction from"" spatial adverbial {e.g. babirnali
!   :   J.l. ' [
        I   (,
            I
                   304                               THE CLAUSE                   'from the bottom') is used, it invariably occurs in an ABL 1 PP, as (5-29)
                   illustrates. Examples are:
                         (5-29) nganyi liyarnali -nhingi
                                I        from:west ABL
                                'I'm from the west.'
                         (5-30) niyaji yoowooloo moolooddja -nhingi
                                this    man        [place]   ABL
                                'This man is from Mulurrja.'
                   [3] Possessive. In possessive characterising clauses an item is characterised by
                   the property that it is someone's possession. The Attribute is realised by an NP
                   with a Qualifier realised by an oblique pronoun, or by a OAT PP. An example
                   is:
                         (5-31) butcher ngaloowinyi lanis -joo
                                [name] son              [name] OAT
                                'Butcher is Lanis's son/a son of Lanis.'
                         Granted that is no need to distinguish a class of possessive identifying
                   clauses in Gooniyandi, it may seem surprising that I should set up a distinct
                   class of possessive characterising clauses. My reason for doing so is that
                   possessive characterising clauses contrast with intensive and circumstantial
                   characterising clauses in terms of the expression class of the Attribute: whereas
                   in intensive clauses the Qualifier in the Attribute NP is always a nominal, in
                   possessive clauses it is frequently a pronominal; and whereas in circumstantial
                   clauses the Attribute is realised by a PP or Adverbial, in possessive clauses it is
                   realised by an NP.","[285, 286, 287, 288]"

  there is one new participant in the second situation. Similarly (6-37) does not
  suggest that the same letter was involved:

462                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICS
Although all available examples show some continuity of participants across the
clauses, it is not known whether this is necessary.
     There is also a particle ngambiddi which frequently translates into 'again' in
English - see section 6.4.17. It is often followed by -nyali REP, as in the
following example.
      (6-38) nganyi nyagginboowoo ngambiddi -nyali
             I        he:will:spear:me again         REP
             'I might be speared again (not necessarily by the same person).'
(ii) 'too, also•. When -nyali REP is encliticised to a given constituent
indicating a quality presumed to apply to some earlier established referent, it
normally translates as 'too' or 'also'. The given quality is indicated to apply to a
new entity, which is as a rule the theme of the clause (cf. section 6.3.5 below).
For example:
      (6-39) yoowooloo gambi bagiri goornboo gambi            -nyali bagiri
             man         sick    he:lies woman      sick       REP she:lies
             'The man is sick, and so too is the woman.'
      (6-40) thiddoo gooddgoo -ya        -nyali bagiri
             kangaroo hole        LOC REP he:lives
             'Kangaroos live in holes too.' (Given that dogs also sleep in holes.)
(iii) 'same'. This sense occurs when -nyali REP is encliticised to a constituent
of a nominal phrase (NP or PP) with definite reference. The referent is asserted
to be identical with a previously established entity. For instance:
      (6-41) yiganyi   warangbooddoomi niyaji -ya       -nyali
             uncertain they:might:sit       this    LOC REP
             'They might sit at this same (place).'
      (6-42) nhoowoo -nyali yingi goowajgoolagini diyadiya miga -nyali
             his       REP name he:calls:himself peewee that REP
             '(The peewee) is called by the name of his song, diyadiya.'
(Note that (6-42) occurred in a text in which the identity of the bird had already
been established. Accordingly, the first occurrence of -nyali REP does refer back
to the previous text, not forward to diyadiya 'peewee'.)
(iv) 'one and the same'. A slightly different sense of 'same' is involved in
examples such as (6-43):
                                                                                       i

parttctpant.(v) 'all'. When -~~ali REP is encliticised to a number word it usually has this
~e~se; more _spectftc.ally •. it indicates that the totality of a given or presumed set
ts mvolved m the sttuauon. -Nyali REP covers only this part of the semantic
range of all. For example,
      (6-44) garndiwangooddoo -nyali booldoogbiddani
             many                  REP they:broke
             'All (of the eggs) broke.'
      (6-45) mirdloonmi ngarloodoo -nyali
             I:tied:them      three REP
             'I tied up all three.'
In fact, this meaning occurs when -nyali REP is attached to any quantifying
expression. whether or not it is a number word:
      (6-46) riwi mangaddi ngaddagi -yoo -miya yaddangi
             camp not         mine     DAT ON our
             boojoo -yoo -nyali
             finish   DAT REP
             'This camp is not only mine, it belongs to all of us.'
      As has just been mentioned, the sense of 'all' covered by -nyali REP forms
only a part of the range of the English word all: all of a given set of referents.
Where the set is not given, -nyali REP is not encliticised to the Quantifier of an
NP. Thus Quantifiers such as garndiwangooddoo 'many' are ambiguous between
the senses 'many' and 'all' (when the referent is not given).'
(vi) 'still'. Like the French encore, Italian ancora. and Spanish todavia. all of
which normally translate as 'again', -nyali REP sometimes requires the gloss
'still'. In this sense -nyali REP always has a non-verbal constituent in its scope.
A number of different nuances of meaning are identifiable depending on which
non-verbal constituent is in its scope; this constituent indicates the particular
respect in which the situation is continuing. This may be:
464                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICS     (a) A purely temporal continuation, with focus on the time; the situation
obtaining now also obtained before. Example:
      (647) jiginya biddangi mangaddi wardgiri           giraddiri wamba -nyali
             child    their      not        he:walks he:crawls still      REP
             'Their child doesn't walk; he still crawls.'
      (b) A participant may be continuing to do or suffer a particular situation;
that is, the focus of the continuation of the situation is on some participant's
continued involvement:
      (4-48) nganyi -nyali milaana       mangaddi ngooddoo milaa
             me         REP he:sees:me not           that  he:sees:him
             'He's still looking at me, not at him.'
      (c) The process may continue to occur in a particular circumstance:
      (6-49) niyaji -ya   -nyali warawiri
             this    LOC REP you:will:stand
             'Keep standing there still. •
     (d) Finally, a quality may continue to remain an attribute of a participant
throughout the situation:
      (6-50) mooyoo -nyali bagiyi
             sleep       REP he:lay
             'He still slept.'
(vii) 'always'. This sense may be found when -nyali REP has an attribute in
its scope, the attribute being asserted as applicable forever, or for the entirety of
a particular time span. An example is (6-51).
      (6-51) mangaddi gilbawayingi        marlami -nyali barnbindi
             not       he:was:finding:it without REP he:retumed
             'He would never find (anything); he'd always return empty handed.'
     Rarely, -nyali REP occurs on the particle ngambiddi 'again' in this sense,
indicating daily iterative occurrences of processes such as shaving. For example,
      (6-52) ngambiddi -nyali thiddajga
             again        REP he:defecates
             'He defecates daily.'
(viii) 'throughout'. This is a very closely related sense to 'always', and
indicates the continued presence of an attribute throughout the duration of a
                                   ENCUTICS                                      465process. The only difference is that a single action is referred to, rather than a
number of like actions over a period of time. For instance:
     (6-53) jimandi -nyali bariwindi. rnangaddi dagoodtJa,vani
            good     REP he:climbed not             he:fell:in
            'He climbed well all the way; he didn't fall.'
(ix) 'together'. This use of -nyali REP is closely related to sense (v) 'all', but
carries the added nuance that the participants are considered to form a single
group together with respect to their involvement in the situation. (6-54)
exemplifies this sense.
     (6-54) dibajwaddiwiddaniyi              garndiwiddi -nyali gardbiddmliyi
            they:two:pushed:each:other:over two              REP they:two:fell
            'They pushed each other and fell over together.'
    This sense is not restricted to cases where -nyali REP is attached to a
numeral; it also occurs when this enclitic is attached to a verb stem:
      (6-55) ngooddoo -yarndi yilib .        -nyali -widdiddi
             that        PL     sneak:away REP they:went
             ngaddagi -nhingi riwi
             my         ABL camp
             'They all sneaked away together from my camp.'
(x) 'precisely, exactly, just'. When -nyali REP has in its scope nominal
phrases (NPs or PPs) or adverbials, it may indicate that precisely the referent
entity, quality, or circumstance, and none other, is the one involved in the
situation referred to. Some illustrative examples of the various possibilities are
given below:
      (6-56) jijagji    minyawoo -jangi -nyali
             he:spoke cat           SEM REP
             '(The bird) made a noise exactly like a cat.'
      (6-57) mangaddi yoodgoowali                ngirnda marla -ya -nyali
             not         I:was:putting:it:down this       hand LOC REP
             goorijgila
             I: hold: it
             'I haven't put it down; it's right here in my hand.'
(Note that (6-57) admits of another interpretation: 'I haven't put it down, it's still
in my hand'. In the particular context in which (6-57) occurred- where the
466                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICSlocation of the item was the focus of attention -      the translation given is the
most reasonable one.)
      (6-58) niyaji -ya    -nyali birndiddi -ya      gardbiddini
             this    LOC REP plain            LOC they:hit:him
             'They killed him right there on the plain.'
     Just as in English, this sense of -nyali REP combines with yaningi 'then,
now, at that time', with the effect of specifying 'right now'. It is usually used to
suggest the imminence of a process, or of the point of completion of an
accomplishment (in combination with the progressive). Thus:
      (6-59) wardngiri yaningi -nyali
             I:go      now       REP
             'I'm going right now.'
      (6-60) yaningi -nyali thithiwalimi
             now       REP I:am:going
             'I'm going right now.'
(xi) 'really'. A perhaps fairly closely related sense is a type of intensification,
whereby a property is asserted as being held to a significant extent. The main
difference would appear to lie in which element is in the scope of -nyali REP.
Whereas in the last sense it is (treated as) some sort of thing, in this case it is a
quality. Compare (6-61)with (6-56) to (6-60).
      (6-61) minyjidda -nyali waddamba bijngarni
             hUe          REP flood       itemerged
             'A truly big flood came up.'
      (6-62) gooniyandi yalawa -nyali yoodbindi
                         near      REP he:put:them
             '(The mythical being) put the Gooniyandi people very close by.'
(xii) 'intensive'. Yet another sense closely related to the preceding two is
found when -nyali REP is encliticised to certain temporal adverbs. It is specified
that the time at which the process took place was right at the central or paradigm
point ofreference of the adverbial. This is the case in
      (6-63) moongaya -nyali       gijloondi
             morning       REP i:got:up
             'I got up early in the morning.'
where reference is made to the very early morning, just after sunrise, the              I
                                                                                        l
                                   ENCUTICS                                    467
paradigm point of reference of moongaya 'morning', which can however include
within its reference the time up to about midday.
(xiii) 'really, surprisingly'. There are just a few cases in which -nyali REP
is encliticised to the verb stem, apparently suggesting that it is surprising that
the event or process occurred at all, at least with the present actor. (However, as
there are so few examples available of this type, it is impossible to be certain
that this was the nuance intended.) An example is:
     (6-64) ngaaddi wajbaddi     -widdangooddoo thadda -yoo
            stone he:threw:it at:them             dog     DAT
            gard -nyali -winbini
            hit    REP he:hit:them
            'He threw stones at the dogs and really/even hit them.'
     (6-65) thadda -ngga looddoob -nyali -woonaddi
            dog     ERG chase          REP he:extends:to:them
            'The dog really chases bullocks (which is surprising).'
(xiv) 'just, only'. In the odd example or two -nyali REP appears to have the
sense 'only' or 'just':
     (6-66) nganyi wanggalala biliga -nyali
             I          I:was:tired middle REP
             'I felt tired at only half way.'
      This covers the main uses of -nyali REP, as far as I have been able to
distinguish them. Undoubtedly there are still further uses that I have been unable
to identify, and others not represented in the present corpus. There are also
usages that do not fit neatly into any of these categories. l give one illustration
only:
     (6-67) niyaji jigiddijla      miga      -nyali galgalmi
            this     I:tickled:him like:that REP he:laughed
            'I tickled him and made him laugh.'
It is possible, but by no means certain, that this involves a use of the type (x)
'precisely': 'I tickled him and that's exactly why he laughed'.
McConvell (1983a) has proposed that again in English, and -rningan -which
is usually glossed 'again'- in Gurindji are both characterisable in the following
way:
468                            TOPICS IN SEMANTICS
                                                                                            I
                                                                                            1                                                                                            1
                                                                                            '
      (6-68) again

                Assertion (A): S 1 at T.
             where S2 is a subpart of S 1 up to and including S 1; the relation
             between S 1 and S 2 being defined by a set of scope rules.
             (McConvell1983a:4).
                                                                                            1
                                                                                            1
McConvell (1983a) suggests that the differences in scope of the two morphemes
in English and Gurindji account for the differences in range of meaning between
the two languages, and that the differences in scope are due mainly to the fact
that the English morpheme is a free word whereas the Gurindji morpheme is an
enclitic.
      (6-68) clearly describes at least a part of the range of -nyali REP delimited
above. However, it is not clear that the presuppositions involved in the use of
-nyali REP are necessarilyfull situations (referred to by full clauses). It would
seem that normally only subparts of situations are presupposed by, and relevant
to, the use of -nyali REP. For this reason, and secondly, lacking a set of scope
rules, I propose a modification to (6-68) for a description of the formal meaning
of -nyali REP. In order to keep the two approaches distinct, I will use the term
PRESUMED (following Rochester and Martin 1979:55) when making reference to
parts of situations. The term 'presupposed' will be reserved for full situations
only. It follows that -nyali REP typically relates the constituent in its scope to
some presumed antecedent. (6-68) may be replaced by:
      (6-69) -nyali REP
                 Presumed: At at some time before T
                 Asserted: A2 at T
             where At and A 2 are subparts (either proper or improper) of the
             situation, determined by the scope of -nyali REP, and A 1 is less
             than or equal to A 2, this relation having the subset and scalar
             interpretations.
It is clear that in general A 1 and A 2 are identical: for example, in (6-31), A 1 and A2
both refer just to the process mila- 'see', excluding all participants, circumstances,
etc .. The qualification that A 1 may be included in A 2 is necessary, not only for the
'back to a former state or position' sense of (i), but for other uses, as will emerge
below.
     In (6-69) A refers to the referent of any constituent, nominal, verbal, or
adverbial. Secondly, the exact nature of the relationship between A 1 and A2 has
not been specified as it is in (6-68); it is given as 'is less than or equal to',
which can be interpreted either in the subset sense or the scalar sense (see below
                                     ENCLITICS                                     469page475).
    The main senses of -nyali REP identified above are listed below:
          (i) 'again'; repetition of a situation, or back to a former state or
              position.
         (ii) 'also, too'
        (iii) 'same'
        (iv) 'one and the same'
         (v) 'all'
        (vi) 'still'
       (vii) 'always'
      (viii) 'throughout'
        (ix) 'together'
         (x) 'precisely, exactly, just'
        (xi) 'really, very'
       (xii) 'intensive'
      (xiii) 'really, surprisingly'
      (xiv) 'only, just'
       I now attempt to show how this range may be explained as specific
contextualisations of the general meaning, encoded in formula (6-69).
       In order to do this, we need to take a close look at the variables of formula
(6-69), principally: the scope of -nyali REP, which determines At and A 2; the
relation between At and A2 ; and the timeT. We begin with those senses
involving the subset interpretation of the relationship 'is less than or equal to';
that is, either A 1 and A 2 are identical, or At is contained in A 2•
      A cursory examination of (i) to (xiv) above will reveal that four senses -
(i) 'again', (vi) 'still', (vii) 'always', and (viii) 'throughout'- stand out from the
others in that they are inherently temporal: they relate processes according to the
time of their occurrence. The three senses of 'again', 'repetition of a situation',
'return to a former state or position', and 'repetition of a process', may be
accounted for by setting different values for At and A 2 in (6-69). Respectively,
A 1=A 2 =situation; A 1=former state/position is contained in (or implied by)
A 2=situation; and A 1=Az=process.
Note that this indicates that (6-68) requires a slight adjustment, at least as far as
the English 'again' is concerned: if s 1 and s 2 are identical, it must be assumed that
there is some intervening time at which the situation docs not occur. That is, two
distinct but equivalent situations are referred to.
     'Still' can also be accounted for by setting A 1=A 2 =situation, where the
470                           TOPICS IN SEMANTICSequality is strict: the situation is precisely the same one, not just of the same
type. It is presumed that the situation obtained at some time before T, and
asserted that exactly the same situation obtains at T, and all times in between. T
is the time of the situation; this is usually, though not necessarily also the
present time.
      Senses (vii) 'always' and (viii) 'throughout' arise with identical values for
A 1 and A2• The three different senses arise in different contexts as follows. (vi)
occurs when the main interest is centered on whether the situation obtains at the
point of time T; it is taken for granted that the action took place over an
extended period of time, continuously up to the point where it fmished. For (vii)
and (viii), the major concern rests on the status of the situation up to and
including the time T. More specifically, sense (vi) occurs when there is an
expectation to the contrary, that the situation did not obtain at T; senses (vii)
and (viii) arise when the expectation is that the situation did not occur
throughout the time period up toT. The differences between (vii) and (viii) lie
simply in the nature of the referent situation: for (vii), there is a succession of
regular iterations of actions of the particular type over an extended period of
time; for (viii), there is a single occurrence.
      Although a single formal meaning accounts for these uses of -nyali REP,
the enclitic itself fulfils distinct functions in the utterance of which it is a part.
In sense (i), it clearly has a textual function, associating one situation or part of
a situation with a previously mentioned situation, or part of a situation. Here
-nyali REP contributes to the maintenance of textual CONTINUITY, in the sense
of Martin (1981). For the other three senses, however, likely as not there is no
previous mention of the presumed thing or situation, and -nyali REP is not
functioning as a discourse structuring device. Rather, its use is conditioned by
EXPECTATIONS created by and in the speech event, and it explicitly marks these
expectations as false. (Expectation is not an inherent part of the meaning of
-nyali REP, as it is of -moowa ON and -ngaddaya TOO, and neither is the
expectation compared with the assertion- see sections 6.3.3 and 6.3.4 below.)
No change need be made to the characterisation of (6-69). That -nyali REP has
alternate functions of 'expectation modification' -    in Halliday's terms an
interpersonal function (Halliday 1970:143) - and continuity- a textual function
in Halliday's terms (Halliday 1970:143) is not really surprising. (Compare the
English may, can, etc. which occur in both interpersonal functions (marking
modality) and experiential functions (marking modulation); cf. Halliday
(1970/1976). These same two senses occur in English again (Rumsey 1982b:l31).
     The four senses (ii) 'too, also', (iii) 'same', (v)'all', and (ix) 'together', also
involve time, only in this case, it is speech-situation time, and not the time of
                                    ENCLITICS                                    471
the referent situation. Instead of harking back to something that happened before
the situation described by the clause, each of these four senses, as noted above,
involves reference to an entity or quality mentioned earlier. The meaning is thus
'what I assert now is, or includes, what I (or someone else) said before'. In
formula (6-69) the presumed becomes 'A 1 at a time before now', the asserted is
'A2 now'. These are, in the terminology of Halliday and Hasan (1976:241)
INTERNAL uses of -nyali REP, as against the EXTERNAL uses of (i), (vi), (vii),
and (viii). (It is of course often the case that what is mentioned before also
happened before; but there are test cases such as example (6-39) above where the
referent situations are temporally contiguous.)
Inspection of the above examples shows that there need not be a relation of
temporal succession between the situation including A 1 and the situation including
A 2 . This time relation is immaterial to these uses of -nyali REP.
      The four internal senses all occur when -nyali REP has less than clausal
scope. The scope is typically, but not necessarily, nominal or adverbial; in the
case of senses (ii) and (ix), it may also be verbal. Sense (ii) 'too, also' occurs
when A 1=A 2 =attribute or process associated with the theme of the clause.
Roughly, 'I've (or you've) mentioned this property or process in connection with
some (other) entity before, and now I mention it with respect to x (the theme of
the clause)'. -Nyali REP is attached to a constituent functioning as a clausal
attribute (or secondary predicate), or to the verb stem. This sense is in
complementary distribution with sense (iii) 'same', which occurs when -nyali
REP is attached to nominal phrases; the two senses correspond to different
scopes of the enclitic. For 'same', A1=A 2=a referent thing or place. Senses (ix)
and (v) differ from each other in precisely the same way. The first has as its
scope a quality or process associated with the clausal theme; the second has an
entity as its scope.
      On the other hand, senses (ii) 'too, also' and (iii) 'same' group together in
contrast to senses (v) 'all' and (ix) 'together'. The first two have a discourse
structuring role, focussing on the relation of the present referent thing, quality or
process, to an earlier mentioned one. The latter two are used to contradict
expectations that not all of a previously mentioned group are involved, or that
individuals were involved separately in the situation. -Nyali REP occurs in the
latter two senses only where there is a contrary expectation: the same meanings
of 'together' and 'all' are allowable interpretations of expressions without this
enclitic.
      We have seen that three major factors influence the interpretation of -nyali
REP as one of these eight senses. They are: its scope and focus, which
472                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICSdetermine the values of A 1 and A2 ; the nature of the timeT; and the function of
the enclitic in the clause to which it belongs. Table 6-1 sets out the eight senses
discussed so far in tenns of these factors.","[445, 446, 447, 448, 449, 450, 451, 452, 453, 454, 455, 456]"
"6.5.4.3 Concluding remarks
I have shown in this section that the two mood enclitics -ja- SUBJ and -wila-
FACT function like the logical operator 1-. In effect, they contain full clauses
(with or without logical particles) within their scope, indicating the speaker's
attitude towards (his/her acceptance of, provisional acceptance of, etc.) the •
proposition expressed. The three modes (see sections 6.5.3.1 to 6.5.3.3), by
contrast, express the speaker's evaluation of the status of the situation referred to
-the desirability, likelihood, or certainty of its occurrence. Use of the modes is
based on the speaker's evaluation of the actual circumstances surrounding the
situation; use of the moods is not.
                              VERBAL CATEGORIES                                 5576.5.5 The classifiers
Gooniyandi has a set of twelve verbal classifiers, obligatory in each finite VP
(see section 3.9.3.2.1 for morphological details) which provide a semantically
based classification of processes. These classifiers divide processes into two
primary groups which have been referred to (above page 201) as
accomplishments and extendibles. A correlate of this opposition is that the
progressive aspect marker normally occurs only in conjunction with
accomplishments (for exceptions see page 527). Nine of the classifiers identify
the process as an accomplishment, the remaining three identify it as an
extendible.
      Within the two subsets of classifiers so defined three matching
subdivisions may be made, depending partly on the transitivity of the clause in
which the classifier occurs (see section 5.2.1.3). Two classifiers, one from each
acktionsart (or lexical aspect) type. occur uniquely in reflexive/reciprocal clauses.
A further three never occur in transitive clauses; they usually occur in
intransitive clauses, but one may occur in middle clauses also. The remainder
 typically occur in transitive clauses, though all but one also occur in intransitive
and middle clauses as well. Classifiers from the frrst two groups may occur with
 a single pronominal prefix only (cf. page 203).
       Given these distinctions, the classifiers may be divided into six primary
 subsets as shown in Table 6-2.
                      Table 6-2: System of verbal classifiers                               Extendible           Accomplishment

              Intransitive                          +ANI 'fall'
              Middle,        +A 'extend'            +MI 'effect'
              Intransitive,                         +BINI 'hit'
              and Transitive                        +DI 'catch'
                                                    +ADDI 'put'
                                                    +ARNI 1 'emerge'
                                                    +BIRLI 'consume'      Here the major oppositions are: (a) acktionsart (that is, lexical aspect); and
558                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICS(b) transitivity of the clause. It is clear from this table that, as I have claimed,
the classifiers primarily· classify processes (which are referred to by lexical
verbals); and they indicate clausal transitivity but secondarily, and usually as a
consequence of their classification of the process. +ARNI2 and +MARNI are the
exceptions. Similarly, the accomplishment-extendible opposition applies to
processes and not to full situations. That the classifier classifies the process, and
not the full situation follows from the fact that although 'x walked to the river'
is clearly an accomplishment achieved when the river is reached, it is always
treated as an extendible process, the classifiers chosen in the Gooniyandi version
being invariably +I. Clearly it is the extendible process 'walk' that is being
classified.
      As has been mentioned before, the classifiers do not divide the class of
lexical verbs into disjoint classes. Most lexical verbs may occur with at least
 two classifiers, the combinations having contrasting meanings. Usually the verb
 will occur with classifiers from alternate columns of Table 6-2, with an
 acktionsart difference, or from alternate rows, with a 'transitivity' difference.
 Fewer verbs choose alternate classifiers from within single cells in the table.
       Before discussing each classifier in tum, it will be useful to provide
 exemplification of the primary bipartition between accomplishments and
 extendibles. (For exemplification of the transitivity distinctions, see section
 5.2.1.3.) Examples are:                  bagi-          +I 'lie'
                               { +ANI 'lie down'                  waddin-      {   +I 'be ill'

                                   +ANI 'remember' (i.e. 'fall to thought')                  ngarag-      {   +A 'work on constructing'
                                   +MI 'make, complete'                  miga-        {   +I 'say, talk, think'
                                   +MI 'tell'                  gaj-         {   +A, +ARNI2 'cut, chop (self)'
                                   +MI, +MARNI 'cut off (self- e.g. finger)'

                                   +ARNI1 'consume completely'
    There is to the best of my knowledge a single unexpected and so far
unexplained irregularity: the verb doow- 'get' occurs with +A, never with the
expected (given the English gloss) accomplishment type classifier.
[1] Extendibles
(a) +I 'be, go'
(b) +A 'extend'
(c) +ARN12 reflexive/reciprocal
There is a significant correlation between the extendible classifier chosen and the
transitivity of the clause in which it occurs. The correlation is perfect in the case
of +ARN12, which occurs only in reflexive/reciprocal clauses; and conversely all
reflexive/reciprocal clauses choose the classifier +ARNlz when the process is an
extendible. There is a less than perfect association of +A with transitive clauses,
and +1 with intransitive and middle clauses. +1 never occurs with more than one
pronominal prefix, and so when it occurs in a clause with two inherent
participants, one of them must be referred to by an oblique pronominal enclitic.
Usually this participant is referred to by a DAT (sometimes a LOC) PP, and the
clause is middle.
      There are, in fact, a significant number of examples in which +A occurs in
intransitive and middle clauses. These include among others (5-67) and (5~369),
respectively. Examination of the counterexamples brings to light the meaning
560                         TOPICS IN SEMANTICSdistinction involved. +A classifies the PROCESS as one which extends from or
emanates from an Actor; +I classifies the process as one which is totally
contained within the Actor/Medium, which does not extend out from him/her.
Processes of the former type need not of course be directed effectively from an
Agent to a Goal, while processes of the latter type, actualised completely within
the Actor, may still be directed non-effectively towards a Goal.
       I will now give some specific exemplification of the proposed distinction.
The only verb classified by +A which occurs in middle clauses is moow- 'look
for/at, direct the gaze towards', which process MUST extend beyond the Actor. By
contrast, the lexemes which occur with +I in middle clauses - such as jijag-
'speak•, nyimij- 'blink, wink' - are totally located within the behaver.
       The main processes classified by +A which occur in intransitive clauses
are: mila- 'look at, see', moow- 'direct gaze (at)', and ngab- 'consume'. In
intransitive clauses mila- 'look at, see' and moow- 'direct gaze at' refer to looking
in a direction at nothing in particular. (Contrast the very rare collocation of
mila- with +I (and also of danymili- 'listen, hear' with the same classifier),
which refers not to looking in a direction, but to the general ability to see.)
Furthermore, mila- 'see' and ngab~ 'eat' can occur with inanimate Actors,
referring respectively to the shining of the sun, and burning of a fire. Both
processes extend beyond the Actor. Contrast for example, riny~ 'blow (of the
 wind)', which occurs with +A in transitive clauses, having the sense '(the wind)
 blows something (e.g. a leary. But in intransitive clauses riny- occurs with +I,
 and has the sense '(the wind) blows', a process entirely located in the wind. There
 is a single stem-classifier collocation that does not immediately lend itself to the
 proposed interpretation. This involves the derived verbal stem bij-bi-wani-
 (emerge+IT+IT1) 'to emerge or arrive at a place successively, day after day',
 which like all stems involving -bi- IT occurs with the classifier +A.
        +A classifies the process as one in which the activity emanates from an
 Actor (the Medium or Agent, depending on the clause type), which is as a rule
 an active participant in the process (even if it is inanimate). However, for +I
 type processes, the Medium may be either active or inactive in the situation,
 which may be an action, being, becoming, or happening situation.
(2] Accomplishments
(d) +BIND! 'get'
(e) +ANI 'fall'
These two classifiers were distinguished (see ·Table 6-2) from the other
                              VERBAL CATEGORIES                                561accomplishment classifiers by their inability to occur in transitive clauses.
Indeed, they appear to always occur in intransitive clauses. (I hesitate to deny
that they could occur in middle clauses, though there are no examples available.)
They occur with two major types of processes: those involving a change of
state, and those involving a change of position, or motion. The Medium may be
either active or inactive/passive.
       The semantic contrast between +BINDI and +ANI can be explained in
general terms as follows. +BIND! indicates that the point of accomplishment of
the process is reached as the natural conclusion of a progression of events or
circumstances leading up to that point. The actualised process is an extension of
this build up, from which it does not differ in type. +ANI on the other hand
indicates that the process is accomplished suddenly, and is not (seen as) the
natural conclusion or extension of a progression of circumstances. (This is not
 to say that, in the real world, the process just occurs out of the blue, any more
 than that an Agent need be an ultimate active and controlling causer. There may
be a sequence of cause and effect, but the actual process referred to is seen as
 typologically different from the sequence leading up to its actualisation.) +ANI
 focusses on the point of accomplishment as the initial point, before which there
 is no evidence of the process. However, after the accomplishment there may be a
 continuation of the induced state of affairs. +BINDI by contrast focusses on the
 point of accomplishment as the culmination of preceding events, of which there
 is evidence. After the accomplishment of an +ANI process, activity (and change)
 may still ensue; but the active or dynamic part of a +BIND! process is all before
 the point of accomplishment. Where the condition obtains subsequently, it is
 entirely inactive, a state of result. This is evident from the fact that the
 progressive aspect may refer to the time subsequent to the point of
 accomplishment of an +ANI process, but not a +BINDI process- see section
 6.5.2, and especially example (6~233).
       In the case of processes involving motion, +ANI typically indicates the
 direction of motion as downwards from a point. Examples are gard- 'fall', thood-
  'descend', yood- 'sit down', yilij- 'rain to fall', etc .. These processes may be
 regarded as accomplished once the point of origin is left. Downward motion
  typically reaches a bottom, or point of completion, under the influence of
  gravity, though this is not necessarily the case in water, where reaching the
  bottom is usually the marked state of affairs. For instance, nyoombool-
  'imrnerse in water' collocates with +ANI, referring to the process of diving under
  the swface of water. This may refer to a ""surface dive"", beginning and ending in
  the water; this process is accomplished once the point of origin (the surface of
562                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICSthe water) is left. +BIND! processes of motion, on the other band, are typically
directed upwards towards a point Examples include doorloog- 'arise', bajgi- 'get
up and go', bar- 'climb upwards', etc .• +BINDI processes are accomplished once
the endpoint has been reached. The opposition between +ANI and +BINDI in
this context is brought out in the contrast between baabiddi 'below', which is
classified by +ANI, and laandi 'up', which is classified by +BIND!. The fonner
may, for instance, refer to any drop in the water level of a river, without
suggesting that the lowest point has been reached. The latter may refer only to a
rise of water level that reaches at least a local peak.
        But both +ANI and +BINDI may refer to horizontal motion, and here
 +ANI normally refers to leaving. or setting off from a point - e.g. looddoob~
 'tum off, daloodd- 'slip', etc.- whereas +BINDI refers to reaching or achieving
 a point- e.g. barn- 'return, get back', dirib- 'enter, go inside' (contrast dagoodd-
 'fall in' (e.g. into a hole, and by extension of the sun setting) which is classified
by +ANI), yilib- 'sneak away' (successful only after a certain point has been
 reached), and so on. Furthermore, there are a couple of examples in which +ANI
 refers to processes in which the motion is initially upwards, such as jaddg·
 'jump up or across'. Here, of course, the process is accomplished as the ground
 is LEFT (not as it is reached). Examples like this show the inadequacy of the
  gloss 'fall\ for +ANI, but support the proposed description in tenns of the
  location of the point of accomplishment.
        Similar remarks apply to processes of change of state. As has been
  mentioned already, +BINDI frequently occurs with nominal roots, with an
  inchoative sense. The resulting quality is always 'grown into' through, or
  brought about by natural means, and the end result is typologically like an
  earlier stage, only further advanced. (Naturally in specific instances it may occur
  so suddenly that there is no appreciable progression, but this does not affect the
  general point being made here. The process is treated as though there is a
  progression.) The same applies to processes of change of state referred to by
  verballexemes, and classified by +BIND!: they are processes which typically
  show signs of occurring before they are actually accomplished. Examples include
  lalbag- 'split', langgidd- 'tear', dij- 'snap' (which all involve progression of the
  disjunction through the Medium), nyil- 'get an erection', and so on.
         Where the change of state process is classified by +ANI, the new state is
  seen as a sudden change of condition of the entity, which cannot differ in degree
  from any previous condition. Included are processes such as waddin- 'fall ill',
  nang- 'die', booroo- 'hide', bagi- 'lie down, fall to sleep', wangaddag- 'get lost',
  ngaloong- 'be born\ etc.. Nominals do not as a rule occur with +ANI, since they

nonnally refer to qualities which may be acquired by degrees.
    A few verbal roots occur with both +ANI and +BIND!, carrying predictable
differences in meaning. For example,
                        +ANI 'fall busted'
                          (e.g. as for an egg dropped on the ground)
     booldoog-          +BINDI 'get busted'
                           (e.g. as of an egg busting as the result of
                           being hit, or eventually bursting with age.)
                        +ANI 'fall undone'
                          (e.g. of own accord.)
      yoolaj-
                        +BIND! 'come undone'
                           (e.g. as a result of someone pulling at a shoelace.)      raddiny-         +ANI 'fall thirsty' (e.g. from lack of water.)
                     { +BINDI 'get thirsty' (e.g. for water or alcohol.)(The examples given here are attested senses in the corpus.)
     Compare also the following:
           waddin-      •. . +ANI   'fall ill'
           gambi-       •. . +BINDI 'get sick'
           thathadd-    ••• +ANI . 'stop suddenly or unpredictably'
           moogoo-.     •.. +BINDI 'cease' (of wind, usually by degrees)
           ding-        ... +BINDI 'cease' (of flow of water, again usually by
                                      degrees)
      Finally I reiterate that the description given here applies to the central
significance of the lexical item only. If things may totter before they fall, and
split instantaneously, these distinctions are not marked by the choice of
classifiers. They are of the order of aspectual distinctions, not process
distinctions - contrast the three examples of the previous paragraph.
(f) +ARNI1 'emerge'
This classifier is definitely attested in combination with three verballexemes
only:. bij- 'emerge, come out', goorla- 'lift outl, and thooddboord. . 'lift out'. Each
of these processes involves the emergence of something, the Medium, which
was fonnerly obscured from view.
      Bij- 'emerge' (which is possibly cognate with the Western Desert pit)--
564                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICSpij- 'go, move, walk'), in combination with +ARNI1 refers to the emergence of
something at a particular location (i.e. anival) or of its moving into view out of
an obscuring medium (as in the rising of the sun). This lexeme also occurs with
the classifiers +MI, in reference to boring holes through something, and +A in
reference to bringing something up to a place.
       Goorla- 'lift out' and thooddboord- 'lift out' refer only to such processes of
lifting as involve the removal of a thing from an obscuring environment.
Typically they refer to the removal of food from coals. Contrast other processes
of lifting, such as jiddib- 'lift up', most of which occur with +MI; cf. also
goorla-wani-, which is always classified by +A, and means 'to arouse someone
from sleep by continual prodding'.
(g) +ADDI 'put,
This is the only classifier which seems to always occurs in transitive clauses. It
classifies the process as involving putting, or placement of an object, which is
the Goal/Medium. The term 'placement' requires some comment. It may involve
physical motion of the object, shifting its position; this is the case in about
three quarters of the available examples (numbering around fifty). There are two
main possibilities:
       (i) The object may be placed in a new location, for example, dad- 'put up',
dagoodd- 'insert', booroo- 'hide', ngaladd. . 'roll onto back', and barn- 'return'.
       (ii) The object may be movedJ and placed in a new orbit or projection.
Verbs of this type are waj- 'throw', yooddoog- 'spew up', gilang- 'knock over',
gininy- 'mix', and doomboog- 'split'. We may also include here processes such
as raddiny- 'hang up', and bandig- 'hang up', in which the object is both placed in
a new location, and in a new ""orbit"", its positional mode.
       But in about a quarter of the examples the object does not change location.
Instead, it changes state- that is, it is placed in a different state or condition by
an Agent. Examples include banag- 'dry out', bilyig- break', thathadd- 'stop,
bring to rest', andjaa- 'soak (through) in water (to induce a change in condition),
 leach'. Also included are a few processes in which the existence of the Medium
is affected. This entity may be brought into existence - e.g. gooddg- 'make a
 hole', jard- 'make a ftre'- or put out of existence- e.g. boojoo- 'finish up'.
Note that nearly all of these verbals occur with +ANI rather than +BINDI, if and
 when they occur in intransitive clauses, as would be expected.
(h) +DI 'catch'It is very difficult to find a suitable English verb as a gloss for this classifier,
                              VERBAL CATEGORIES                                565
which indicates that the process is accomplished through the establishment,
breaking, or prevention of a connection or juncture of some type, usually
between the Goal and some other entity.
      +DI almost always occurs in clauses of directed action. Dalyidd- 'slip on
something', which occurs in an intransitive clause, is the only exception I am
aware of. Furthermore, the directed action clause is almost always transitive.
This generalisation admits two exceptions only, involving the verbals gilij-
'prevent someone from doing something (e.g. fighting)', and garloo- 'to find
nothing (at some particular location)', which always occur in middle clauses.
Significantly, these are the only cases in which the connection - between the
(non-Medium) Goal and something else- is prevented, and the middle clause
type classifies the situation as non-effective (see section 5.2.1.3).
       In a fair number of cases, the connection is made between the Goal and the
Agent (including the non-participant Agentt the Instrument). Examples are gool-
'taste, try', nyoonoong- 'move something (e.g. grass) by direct contact', ying-
'crush (e.g. a beetle)', biddib- 'block up', and girib- 'use, finish something up'.
The connection between the Agent and the Goal need not be a physical one. It
may involve a perceptual connection - for example, gilba- 'notice, catch sight
or, wab- 'catch scent or, and minyjiddan- 'take notice or cognisance of.
       Alternatively, the Goal may be connected to something else as in booj-
'put a light to, catch something alight', lamaj- 'bring up to', ngaloog- 'to double
 something back', ngamool- 'flatten to the ground', ngang- 'give', yood- 'put
 down', and diladd- 'spread out'. (At this point, it is not worth identifying and
 systematising the range of possible things the Goal may connect with.) It
 should be noted, however, that there are cases in which there is ambiguity as to
 which connection is established. For instance, when classified by +DI, lamaj-
 may refer either to the act of lifting something onto one's back, or to bringing
 something on the back to a particular place.
       Processes in which the connection is severed include: bala- 'send (away)',
 dij- 'snap an object into two pieces', gij- 'remove', and loow- 'push away'.
 (Contrast dij- •.. +A 'snap, break, but not necessarily into distinct pieces, and
 loow- ... +A 'push along'.)
(i) +BINI 'hit'
'Hit' is an inadequate gloss for this classifier in as much as only about two-thirds
of the attested verbals occurring with +BINI involve 'hitting', and many verbal
Iexemes that involve the notion of hitting are not classified by +BINI. What
+BINI indicates is that the process is realised through action along a straight
566                          TOPICS 1N SEMANTICSline, which involves connection, usually between the Agent and Goal, at a
single point, or at a multiplicity of single points. As distinct from +DI, the
accomplished connection is the one between the Agent and something else,
usually the Goal: where this connection is involved in a +DI process, it is really
the Actor establishing the connection of the Goal with himself/herself (e.g. as in
gilba- 'fmd'), not of himself/herself to the Goal.
       Like the preceding two classifiers, +BINI occurs predominantly in
transitive clauses. There are perhaps two exceptions. The verbal roots doorloog-
'rise up to the surface of water', and also, apparently, yilij- 'rain down heavily',
 occur with +BINI, in intransitive clauses. In both cases the process satisfies the
 general semantic characterisation suggested above: there is straight line motion
 (upwards or downwards), connecting the water surface in a single point in the
 case of doorloog- (contrast doorloog- ..• +BIND! 'stand up, get up'), and the
 ground in a multitude of points in the case of yilij~ (contrast yilij- ... +ANI 'fall
 (of rain)'.)
       The verbs of hitting that are classified by +BINI all involve hitting at a
 single point through action directed straight at the Goal. Included are such
 processes as gard- 'hitt kill, fell', ngool- 'punch', bilgoodd- 'crack on the skull',
 nyag- 'pierce', bilyig- 'break a surface with a point•,6 and bananggadd- 'snatch'.
 Excluded are such processes as laj- 'slap', thoolng- 'kick', and manggadd- 'stab'
 (the latter presumably is excluded by virtue of the fact that the arm (like the leg
 in kicking) does not follow a straight trajectory from the shoulder).
        The remaining processes are of two main types: (i) causative processes~
 involving the designated type of action directed at the undergoer, as in giddra-
 'chase someone away by moving threateningly towards', and yoowa- 'scare
  someone by moving threateningly towards'; and (ii) processes involving the
  meeting of the Agent and Goal at a point: jalba- 'meet up', maddaj- 'pass
  someone (going same or opposite directions)', maroodd~ 'gather up' and gad-
  'leave someone'.
        In most cases the action moves towards the Goal (or the thing directed at),
  but with gad- 'leave', and sometimes maddaj- 'pass' and doorloog- 'arise', it may
  go in the opposite direction.","[537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547]"

                        corresponding verbals. It must be noted, however, that it is not only non-

                        existence outside of the situation. (5-111) and (5-112) show such 'cognate'
                        Mediums as participants in intransitive and transitive clauses respectively.

                              It is not always easy to distinguish Ranges from Attributes. It seems that
                        in some cases, as exemplified in (5-113) below, the NP might be either a Range
                        or an Attribute:

                        The Range interpretation is the only one possible in

                             In conclusion, I remark that middle clauses almost never occur with
                        Mediums of any sort, participant or non-participant - cf. page 324 above. The
                        only exception I am aware of concerns processes of vocal communication, in
                        which thangarndi 'word' may occur as a Medium.

5.2.2.3 The Instrument
In addition to the Agent participant role that is inherent to three of the
Gooniyandi transitivity types, there is a non~inherent non""participant Agent role
which may, like the Range, occur in any of the four transitivity types. This
role, which I will refer to as the INSTRUMENT in order to distinguish it
tenninologically from the participant Agent, is always realised by an ERG PP.
                                                                                                      !
(By contrast, the participant Agent may by realised by either an NP or a PP -                    '!
cf. page 319ff. above.) The Instrument is not the ultimate source of the action,
but is, rather, a secondary entity through which the action is effected or directed.
It is in a sense an extension of the Agent, just as some types of Range -
especially body~parts - are extensions of the Medium.
      Instruments are normally found in clauses of 'directed' action, and they are
often body-parts of the Agent Examples are:
     (5-115) marla -ngga widdijngarni
             hand ERG I:scmtched:myself
             'I scratched myself with my hand.'
     (5-116) marla -ngga mabanjindi
             hand ERG he:farewelled:us
             'He farewelled us with his hand (i.e. by waving).'
     (5-117) moorloo -ngga nyimijnyimijjingadda
             eye      ERG he:winked:at:me
             'He winked his eye at me.'
As remarked above (page 333 ), body-parts are rarely treated as participants. In
general, directed action is seen as stemming from the individual himself/herself -
for a small class of exceptions, see below page 429.
      I mentioned above that Instruments may occur in all transitivity types.
However, they only very rarely occur in intransitive clauses, and then they are
almost always body""parts of the Medium. The following pair of examples
(5-118) and (5-119) are typical: the body-part is used in a marked way, and
particular effort is required throughout the (undirected) process in order to
maintain it. In (5-118), particular effort must be directed through the ankles in
order to walk on tip-toes. This may be contrasted with the more neutral thinga
wardngi (foot I:went) 'I went on foot' (see example (5-132)), in which thinga
'foot' is presumably a Range through which the walking is actualised. No
additional or unusual effort is involved over that required to keep the motion
                                                                                       ''

"                                           (3) Quite frequently phrasal reference to the participant does not occur: within
                                           continuous texts, it is not unusual for clauses to consist of a VP only, or of a
                                           VP together with phrases and words which refer to non-participant entities,
                                           qualities, etc. (see section 5.3.1 below). Even in ""isolation"" it is common for
                                           the clause to occur without phrasal reference to its participants. This is
                                           especially true for first and second person participants. Speakers do not normally
                                           refer to them by free pronominal forms (which, referentially, are redundant in
                                           such clauses) in elicited sentences, and seem to regard their use in this context as
                                           pedantic.
                                                  A VP on its own, that is, constitutes in general a fully 'grammatical'
                                           clause capable of independent occurrence. (It will generally translate into an
                                           English sentence involving pronominals; occasionally they are not quite this
                                           specific.) I assume that these clauses, though 'grammatical', are incomplete, and
                                            that their inherent. participant roles have not been ellipsed.3 The alternative to
                                            this, that the participant roles are not clausal but phrasal (i.e.. VP) roles runs                                            3 It follows that although a clause is as a rule 'replaceable' by its VP, it is not an
                                            endocentric construction with the VP as its head. Compare Matthews (1981: 148-
                                            149), Robins (1964:235), and cf. Blake (1983:145, 163).
                       THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION                               321into a number of difficulties. These relate to the fact that it is the morphological
shapes of the phrases referring to the participants that define the significant
'transitivity' features of the Gooniyandi clause. The forms and combinations of
forms of the pronominal prefixes and enclitics do not do this. This will become
clear shortly. Furthermore, the absence of the major inherent participant roles
may be accounted for under the assumption that they have been ellipsed (see
section 5.3.1).
(4) Occasionally another bi-valent clause type occurs in which the inherent roles
are realised by an ERG PP and a LOC PP, the latter being paired with the
oblique pronominal enclitic. E.g.:
     (5-61) nganyi -ngga tkldda -ya yoowangiraa                    -nhi
            I         ERG dog            LOC I:exercise:caution of:it
            'I'm afraid of the dog.' (i.e. I act cautiously with respect to it)
     (5-62) ngaaddi jirigi -ya ngiddlimi -nhi
            stone bird LOC I:threw:it at:it
            'I threw a stone at the bird.'
In all such cases there exists an agnate clause in which a DAT PP occurs instead
of the LOC: thadda-yoo (dog-DAT) 'for the dog' andjirigi-yoo (bird-DAT) 'for
the bird' could have occurred instead of thadda-ya (dog-LOC) 'at the dog' and
jirigi-ya (bird-LOC) 'at the bird' in (5-61) and (5-62) respectively. The exact
meaning contrast between the two modes of expression remains unclear, and
would appear to lie in the way the situation is viewed, rather than (necessarily)
in differences in the extra-linguistic reality referred to.
       The four clause types identified above may be referred to as the transitivity
types in Gooniyandi: the distinctions are concerned with the ""direction"" of the
action. This is a highly abstract system of meaning, the features of which
contextualise in different ways depending on the 'semantic type' of the clause
 (see page 326 below).
Transitivity has traditionally been regarded as a feature of verbal lexemes. It has
been claimed that in most Australian languages every verbal root is specifically
categorised as either transitive or intransitive, and changes in transitivity must be
marked by the presence of a derivational affix (Dixon 1980:278). This is not the
case in Gooniyandi. Many, if not most verbal roots occur in more than one of the
four transitivity types. For example, the verb mila- 'see, look at' occurs in each of
them:
      (5-63) nganyi milangiri
             I        !:see
             'I am looking.'
          322                                  THE CLAUSE                (5w64) nganyi -ngga milangarni
                       I        ERG I:saw:myself
                       'I saw myself.'
                (Sa65) nganyi -ngga yoowooloo milala
                       I         ERG man              I:saw:him
                       'I saw the man.'

                       I         ERG children       DAT !:glanced       at:them
                       'I glanced at the children.'
          In these cases it is clear that the choice of classifier serves to distinguish between
          the four transitivity types. The classifiers cannot, however, be regarded as
          'derivational' affixes, marking the change in transitivity value of the root. And
          neither the classifier itself nor the VP as a whole can be (as a rule) specified as to
          transitivity type.
                Firstly, with a single exception, every classifier which can occur with two
          pronominal prefixes may occur in both transitive and intransitive constructions
          (see sections 3.9.3.2.2 and 6.5.5). (The exception, +ADDI, does however
          sometimes occur in middle clauses.) For example, compare (5-65) with
                (5-67) middi milaa
                       sun    it:sees:it
                       'The sun is shining.'
                (5-68) middi -ngga milaa
                        sun     ERG it:sees:it
                        'The sun is shining on it (making it hot, etc.).'
                Conversely, the classifier +I which occurs with one pronominal prefix only
          may occur in both intransitive and middle clauses (see for example, (3w21), (3-43),
          (5-59), (5-61) and so on). There are four exceptions: +ARNI2 and +MARNI occur
          in reflexive/reciprocal clauses only, while +ANI and +BIND! appear to occur in
          intransitive clauses only. Secondly, the presence of the oblique pronominal
          enclitic does not automatically mark the clause as middle, as shown by type (b)
          transitive clauses, and various other clauses in which it cross-references a non-
          inherent participant. It is clear from these observations that even given the
          combination of classifier and the lexical verbal element, it is not always possible
          to predict the transitivity value of the clause. However this may be, the VP may
          be regarded as, in a sense, a minor replica of the clause, which makes reference to
          the 'nucleus' of the situation, including the participants (in pronominalised form),
          and there is a reasonable, but imperfect correlation between the transitivity of the
          clause and its VP type.                                       ·                There is clearly a bifurcation between the intransitive and the three other
          transitivity types: the former alone may not occur with a participant referred to
          by an ERG PP. Semantically, this corresponds to the opposition between NON·
          DIRECTED and DIRECTED actions. In intransitive clauses, the sole inherent
          participant is simply engaged in a process, of and by him/herself. There is no
          'transfer' of action to or from any other entity. (Ultimately, of course, this
          depends upon the speaker's perspective: there may well be an external cause or
                       THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION                                323goal to the process, which the speaker does not opt to mention.) This sole
inherent participant of an intransitive clause will be referred to as the MEDIUM:4
it is the entity through which the process is actualised, and comes into
existence.
      In the other three types, there is some 'direction' involved in the process:
there is an inherent participant, referred to by the ERG PP, who is engaged in
some sort of directed activity. The action extends from this participant, which
will be referred to as the Agent, towards something. The Agent is the means by
which, or through which the process takes effect, and is directed. It is in a sense
the 'source' of the directed activity, which emanates from it.
By 'directed' action I do not mean that the process need necessarily be in the
control of an intentionally directing agency. This may by true of the paradigm
cases where there is human agency, such as gard- 'hit, kill, fell' and gaj- 'cut'. etc.,
but even in these cases the action may be accidental. In any event, the process
clearly still emanates from some individual. the Agent. Similarly, directed
processes may emanate from inanimates. Consider for example the following
rather unusual clause:
      (5-69) waya -ngga mirdmarni
              wire ERG it:tied:itself
              'The wire is tangled up.'
What this clause refers to is not just any type of tangled mess of wire, but one
that arose (or is considered to have arisen) out of the agency of the wire itself,
and not through human intervention. Tangled messes of long items such as
fishing lines and wire may be referred to in two ways: either by a clause such as
(5~69), which is typically used in case the material is wire or fishing line, which
materials have the property of recoil. ((5-69) described what happened when a
long length of fencing wire was kicked.) In other cases, where the tangling is of
something which has no such property of recoil, a non-reflexive construction is
used, recognising an external agency - cf. example (5-170).
       Finally, this interpretation applies also to cognitive processes and
processes of perception. It is clear that in Gooniyandi such processes are seen as
active, directed from the experiencer or perceiver (through the agency of his/her
organs of perception); they are not seen as impinging on him/her from the
outside (see examples of mila- 'see' above), even if s/he is relatively passive. The
notion of 'direction' is thus an abstract one removed from all connotations ·of
intention. But in general it is obvious which role in the process itself is the
Agent, and source of the directed action, even if in the real world (as it is
                                                                                                    I    I

this term in the same way as Halliday defines it for English, it does not have
precisely the same designation or significance in the two languages, primarily
because of the differences in the way the two languages organise the clause
semantically.                              ·                                                                                           •   !","[304, 305, 306, 307]"
"    3.4 Adverbials
    Adverbials were distinguished above (see section 3.2) by. their ability to realise
    clause rank roles of circumstance (including location, direction from, direction
    towards, etc.). On the one hand they are distinct from nominals, which may
    realise phrasal roles only, never clausal roles. On the other hand, they differ from
    particles, which, while they have the property of occurring as constituents of
    clauses (where they realise the role of Propositional Modifier - see section
    5.4.1), do not realise circumstantial roles.
          It has been suggested above that adverbials do not form phrasal units with
    one another. They do however form word complexes together. The two
    adverbials in clauses such as (3-21), for instance, might initially appear to fonn
    a phrase, with mayaaddayaadda 'hard' modifying galjini 'fast' (i.e. 'very fast').
    However, such syntagms are very rare, and there is no convincing evidence that
    the relation is one of modification, rather than addition (on which see sections
    4.3.1 and 5.6.2):
         (3-21) mayaad:Jayaadda galjini      giddagiddayi
                hard             fast        he:ran
                'He ran very quickly.'
          In fact, as the gloss indicates, it would seem that mayaaddayaadda is better
    glossed 'hard' than 'very'. (It does not occur as an intensifier of adverbials other
    than those relating to speed; and secondly, it may also occur alone (i.e. without
    another adverbial) in clauses of motion carrying the sense 'hard, energetically'.
    Thirdly, it is obviously the partial reduplication of mayaadda, which is
    segmentable into maya, an adverbial meaning 'hard, energetically' (where the
    verb is not one of motion) and the suffix -wadda (on which see 5.5.1.3 below).)
    For these reasons, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, I assume that
    such syntagms are indeed word complexes, and not phrases. A more literal
    translation of (3-21) would thus be 'He ran hard and fast'.
          Adverbials are as a rule mutually substitutable with PPs; but because they
    have quite different ranges of meanings the two are not in complementary

     152                                    1HEWORD     distribution, and are frequently found in apposition, each adding something to
     the meaning of the other. That is, adverbials and PPs form unit complexes
     together (see section 4.3.2 below).
           There appear to be four main types of adverbial in Gooniyandi: adverb,
     temporal adverbial, spatial adverbial, and frequency adverbial. These will be
     discussed in order in the subsections below.
           In addition, there are two very general adverbials yiniga 'in some manner,
     in what manner', and miga 'in this/that manner', which might perhaps be
     regarded as indefinite and deftnite ""determiners"" respectively for adverbials. They
     are not used in respect of concrete entities (for which the nominal determiners
     discussed in 3.3.1 are used), but rather for types of action, including speech, and
     other 'abstracts' such as qualities. For example,
           (3-22) Q: yiniga ngawali ngaraggmy)a
                     how      woomera you:make:it
                  A: miga      ngaragba
                     like:this you:make:it
                  Q: 'How do you make a woomera?'
                  A: 'You make it like this.'
           Here yiniga 'in some/what manner' and miga 'in this/that manner' refer to
     complex processes, which could only be described in speech in fairly long texts.
     (Incidentally, this probably explains why it was that ""why"" questions I
     constructed withjajiyoo (something-DA1) 'what for' were normally answered in
     terms of entities: unlike English 'what', the use of jaji 'what' seems to restrict
     attention to concrete entities.) The fact that the two words occur in contexts such
     as (3-22) justifies their classification as adverbials. (A nominal would have to
     occur in an ERG PP in an example like (3-22) where it modified the manner of
     action.)
           Miga 'in this/that manner' can refer to at least the following:
     • manners of action, as in (3-22) above and
           (3-23) miga      muoori
                  like:that he:stands
                  'He stands like that';

                 Jike:that SEM you:will:bring:it

         (3-26) miga(wa) wardhiri
                like:that you:will:go
                'Go this way.' (usually accompanied by a gesture);
    • times when, or conditions under which processes occurred or will occur, for
    example:

                sun it:should:get:high like:that LOC you:will:arrive                     !
                                                                                         l
                'Come when the sun is high.';
    • quantity, including quantity of time:
         (3-28) gamba garndiwiddi garndiwiddi yoowarni miga             -ya
                 water two             two          one       like:that LOC
                 ngangbinbidi      maa
                 they:gave:them meat
                 'After five years have elapsed they give them meat.';
    and anything conveyed by means of gestures (see example (3-26) above).
         Like the three indefinite determiners ngoorndoo 'someone, who'. ngoonyoo
    'which' andjaji 'something, what' discussed in section 3.3.1.2, yiniga appears to
    occur in both the indefinite sense of 'in some manner' and the interrogative sense
    'in what manner, how'. And, as well as referring to manners (as in (3-22)),
    yiniga 'in some/what manner' can refer to:
    • content of speech, as in:
         (3-29) yiniga        JZJagjawoominganggi
                some:manner he:should:talk:to:you
                'What will he say to you?'; and
    • number:

                some:manner children    you:hold:them

154                                 TilE WORDIt is likely that further investigation will uncover additional uses of yiniga 'in
some/which manner', perhaps matching with those of miga 'in this/that manner'.
Nominal determiners, as well as the two adverbials miga 'in this/that manner' and
yiniga 'in some/what manner', occur in NPs referring to spoken words. (The first
constituent of (3-29) above, for example, may be expanded into an NP yiniga
thangarndi (in some/what manner word) 'which words'.) It seems that determiners
are generally used when particular words, or groups of words (such as sentences or
texts) are being referred to, and are treated as things. The adverbials are used when
the content or meaning, rather than the actual wording of an utterance is being
referred to.","[136, 137, 138, 139]"
"1.8 Education and orthography
Until very recently, no consideration was given in either the Government or the
Church schools in the Kimberley to the different cultural and linguistic
backgrounds of their Aboriginal pupils. Their traditional languages were not just
ignored, but their use was at times actively discouraged by physical punishment
(for example, as mentioned above, at the early UAM hostel in Fitzroy
Crossing). But there are encouraging signs of changes in attitudes of teachers and
educators, and in the last few years many have started, or are keen to start
language programmes in their schools. In 1982, a language and culture
programme in the local languages was started in the Fitzroy Crossing State
High School, and the involvement of the adults in the local Aboriginal
community, Junjuwa, was sought and encouraged. This programme ceased
operation in 1983, for reasons unknown to me. It was restarted by the new
principal in 1985. Daily classes were conducted in three local languages,
Bunuba, Gooniyandi, and Walmajarri, and these classes are attended by both
Aboriginal and white pupils. Unfortunately, this programme also lapsed within
the year, although there seems to be some interest in reviving it.
 26                               INTRODUCilON       A Gooniyandi language programme has been in operation in Gogo School,
 a primary school with predominantly Gooniyandi pupils, since 1987 · It seems
 to be progressing successfully, and is popular with the children. .
       Other Government schools in the Kimberley region - of which La Grange
 School is the most notable example - have recently started language
 programmes. However, the Western Australian Education Department la~ks a
 policy on bilingual/bicultural education, and these initiatives are at the whim of
 the school principal. This, together with the consequent unavailability of
professional expertise both in matters of linguistic description and in
establishing and running language programmes, and lack of funds, has certainly
done nothing to improve the chances of success of any language programme. To
date, only Catholic Education in the Kimberley has a language policy, and
employs linguists to implement it.
      In 1982 the Yiyili Community School, independently run by that
Community, started operation. At that time it employed one white school
teacher, Robyn Dickinson. The community felt that, in addition to educating
their children in English and mathematics, education in their own language and
culture was equally important. One of the aims of the school (to quote from the
School Policy) is ""To develop and introduce a Gooniyandi language and literacy
progmmme"".
       During my 1982 field trip the Yiyili Community requested my assistance
 as a linguist. I spent a few weeks at Yiyili, during which time I devised a
 practical orthography for Gooniyandi, and produced some introductory materials
 for their programme, including a preliminary draft of a collection of Gooniyandi
 stories, a short dictionary, and a brief description of the principles of writing the
 language, intended for literate Aborigines and teachers involved in the
programme. In 1983 the Yiyili Community employed a Summer Institute of
Linguistics (SIL) linguist, Joyce Hudson, on a part-time basis, to initiate the
language programme in their school. In the following year, Annette Walker,
another SIL linguist, took over this job, but left due to her marriage. From then
until 1988 no linguist was employed, and the language programme ceased
operation. In 1988 it was begun again, with the assistance of Barbara Jones, a
teacher-linguist for the Kimberley Language Resource Centre.
       F~udson produced some basic literacy materials, and developed the
followmg orthography, in consultation with two literate native speakers, David
Street and Topsy Chestnut (Street and Chestnut 1984:4, Hudson I984a, 1984b):
Vowels: a, ar {long a), i, ii (long i), oa (short and long IPA u);
                       EDUCATIONANDORTHOGRAPHY                                  27Consonants: b, m (bilabials); d, n, I (apico-alvelolars); 4.. ll. L r (apico-
                 domals); th, nh, lh (lamino-dentals); j, ny, ly (lamina-palatals);
                 g. ng (dorso-velars); and w, y (semi-vowels).
This orthography was designed principally in order to facilitate the transfer of
literacy skills from English (although personally I do not feel that it went far
enough in this direction). It is not phonemic. The symbol d, for example,
represents two distinct phonemes: the apico-alvcolar stop, and the apico-alveolar
tap or trill. Elsewhere the system over differentiates, in distinguishing the long
ii vowel sound from both the short i and the sequence iyi (sec section 2.1.6. 1),
and a !amino-dental lateral, which to the best of my knowledge occurs only as a
conditioned variant of the lamino-palatallatcral (section 2.1.5.2).
      It seems that there is a very positive attitude towards this orthography
among both staff and students. However, the fact that it is non-phonemic makes
it inappropriate and cumbersome for a work of this nature. And since there is no
substantial body of literature written in the Hudson-Street-Chestnut orthogrnphy,
I have decided not to employ it here. The ideal choice for this hook would
undoubtedly be the practical phonemic orthography I had suggested in I9H2, and
which I used in some early publications (McGregor 1985 and 1986a). This
orthography was based on the well established Walmajarri orthography (sec, for
example, Hudson and Richards 1978:72), to which the two digmphs th and nh
had been added, and the long vowel digraphs ii and uu omitted; it is the same a .-:
the Kija orthography recommended by McConvcll for usc in the Turkey Creek
School. However, I have fell that this orthography is unnecessarily diiTcrcnt
from the native speakers' choice. I have therefore proposed (McGregor 1986h),
for academic purposes only, a phonemic orthography which employs letters and
digraphs which accord more closely 10 Lhc speakers' choices. This system will he
employed throughout this book, except where a narrow phonetic transcription is
necessary, where I will usc IPA symbols. The following lcuers and digraphs are
used:
Vowels: a, aa (long a), i. oo (IPA u);
Consonants: b, m (bilabials); d, n, I, dd (apico-alvcolars); rd, rn, rl, r (apico-
               domals); Jh, nh (lamino-dcntals); j, ny, ly (lamino-palaUlls): g,
               ng (dorso-vclars); and w, y (semivowcls).
     Cluster restrictions prevent ambiguity between digraphs and consonant
clusters, except in the cases of ng and ly. The cluster /n-g/ occurs within
morphemes, where it contrasts with both the velar nasal/ng/ and the nasal stop
28                              INTRODUCTIONsequence /ng-g/; I follow the Hudson-Street-Chestnut decision to distinguish the
first sequence (i.e. the apical n followed by the dorsa-velar stop g) by placing a
full stop between the n and the g, thus: n.g. The cluster fl-y/ occurs at certain
morpheme boundaries. But because it is entirely predictable morphologically,
and contextually unambiguous, there is no need to distinguish the phoneme /ly/
from the phoneme sequence fl-y/ in writing.
In choosing to use an orthography at odds with the one decided on by native
speakers of the language, I realise that I leave myself open to criticism from the
speakers, as well as certain linguists. However, I assure both groups that I do not
mean to question the speakers' decisions, or their rights to make orthographic
decisions; nor so I suggest that they should use my orthography. There seems to
me to be no reason why the two orthographies cannot coexist, each to be used for
its own purposes - mine in academic linguistic descriptions, the Street-Chestnut-
Hudson orthography in literacy materials. (It goes without saying that in any case
 at least two systems of writing the language will be necessary: an adequate
dictionary should at least indicate the phonemic representation of each word -
 and, given the present precarious state of Gooniyandi, perhaps also accurate
 information on their pronunciation.) Furthermore, this book being addressed to an
 audience of linguists, I can foresee no likelihood of confusion resulting from my
 decision. On the other hand, in publications intended principally for use by
 Gooniyandi people and/or for use in language programmes in schools, I have
 employed the Street-Chestnut-Hudson orthography (see for example McGregor
 1988d and in preparation-b).","[38, 39, 40, 41]"
"1.3 Geographical variation
A few minor geographical differences were encountered in Gooniyandi speech.
These were almost entirely lexical. In boundary regions there is usually a
slightly higher percentage of common vocabulary, shared with the neighbouring
language. For example, in the speech of the Gooniyandi people of Yiyili, which
is ncar the eastern border of their territory, a couple of words were encountered
which are shared with Kija and/or Jaru, but which are not usually heard in the
Gooniyandi speech of Fitzroy Crossing and nearby communities. One such word
is gardij- 'cut', which is shared with Kija. However, the differences are too few to
justify the identification of distinct dialects, and none are named (but cf. below).
      The speakers themselves are aware of variation in their language, some of
which they attribute to regions, some to particular individuals in these regions
- but never, in my experience, to socio-linguistic factors such as formality.
The main variation perceived is lexical, but speakers are also conscious of some
minor grammatical differences,2 and of a handful of words which have two2 For instance, on one occasion a verb form which I constructed was rejected as
proper Gooniyandi, but acknowledged as a form used by some Gooniyandi/Kija
speakers in Mulurrja. And some verb forms in the Gooniyandi word book produced
in the Yiyili School (Yiyili Aboriginal Conununity School 1983) differ from the
8                                INTRODUCTIONslightly different phonemic representations. However, it seems that speakers are
not always strictly correct in their expressed beliefs. My observation of actual
usage showed that the variant pronunciation of ginharndi 'you know' as
ginyarndi, for instance, was not geographically determined, despite native
speakers' claims. The so called 'light' form, with the !amino-palatal nasal in the
second syllable, was found in the community in which it was claimed to be
used, but beside the 'heavy' form with the !amino-dental. Moreover, the light
form was also found in other, geographically remote, communities. It may be
that the choice is governed by other factors such as the age or linguistic
provenance of the speaker or the degree of formality of the speech situation, bm
I was unable to verify any of these possibilities.
Quite often speech differences were labeled joowarliny by native speakers of
Gooniyandi (although this term was never used to name anything which could be
unequivocally identified as a dialect). Interestingly, this term (Juwarliny in
Walmajarri orthography) is also the name of a western dialect of Walmajarri
(Hudson and Richards 1978:3). Tentatively, it would seem that the Gooniyandi
term signifies unusualness, non-standard variety (with reference to the speaker's
variety), with connotations of barbarism.","[20, 21]"

6.5.3.2), which occurs in VPs. Although the two are in complementary
distribution, they appear to have nothing in common semantically. For this
reason they are taken to be two distinct morphemes.

dealt solely with the speaker's previous exploits. It draws attention to some focal
point whereby the situation contrasts with the previously obtaining situation(s)

of contrast. Similarly, in (6-23) and (6-24) the speaker is marked as a focal point

and the context of the preceding text respectively. That is, the sense of 'next,
now' implied by -rni SEQ applies specifically to the constituent to which it is
attached. In effect, what is said is that at one time something was involved in a
situation in a certain way, but now another, different thing is. The relation of
succession is not of situations, but of things playing roles in situations: firstly
x was involved, now it is y. (The relationship of succession between situations
follows from this, but of course does not imply it.)
      The above may be summarised: the RANGE of -rni SEQ includes the full
clause, but its FOCUS (cf. Taglicht 1984:1-11) is the constituent it is attached
to. This constituent is as a rule, unsurprisingly, the marked information focus of
the clause; that is, typically the first element of the new. Furthermore, this
focus is normally contrastive.
      When -rni SEQ occurs on Attributes, the comparison is usually with a
situation in which the opposite Attribute, the negation of the Attribute, held at
some previous time:
                            Attribute: NP
      (6-26) langgagooloo girlingiddi -rni. bagiri
             hollow:log     hole        SEQ it:lies
             'The hollow log is open now (it was blocked with dirt before).'
                                   ENCUI'ICS                                   459            Attribute: NP
     (6-27) mooyoo -rni       bagiri
            sleep      SEQ he:lies
            'He's asleep now (he was awake before).'
                                             Attribute: NP
     (6-28) migi -ngga wirdgilanginbini gaji -mi            ngabgina
            ant   ERG it:had:bitten:me sore SEQ it:eats:me
            '(Where) the ant had bitten me it is sore now.'
      Note that a specific antecedent need not necessarily be involved in a
situation of the same type. For example, in
     (6-29) nyiddi      -rni    wamba dcodjawila
            spinifex SEQ later            I:will:throw:it:on
            'I'll put spinifex on(to the boughshade) next.'
Here nyiddi 'spinifex' does not invoke a contrast with something else that was
thrown onto the boughshade. However, it does contrast with other things that
were acted on in appropriate ways in the process of constructing the boughshade.
The spinifex may be seen as one of a succession of materials used in the
construction.
      In the above examples, there has always been a definite antecedent for the
-rni SEQ constituent, established somewhere in the text. This need not be the
case. (6-30) uses a more general sense of 'next' -the hearer is warned that he'll
be the next casualty on the road (none had been specifically mentioned
previously):
     (6-30) niyi moodiga milawa               nginyji -rni
            that car        you:will:see:it you         SEQ
            gilangginggaddoowoo
            it:knocks:you!
            'Look out for that car or it will hit you next.'6.3.2 -nyali REP
This enclitic has the widest, and from an English perspective, the most unusual
range of meanings of all the enclitics. -Nyali REP may be encliticised to
nominals (including nouns, pronouns, and demonstratives), adverbials, and
verbals, but it cannot go onto the inflected part of the verb phrase, the classifier
complex. It is normally the final element of a distributional word. For example,
where the nominal occurs in syntagm with a postposition, -nyali REP always
460                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICSfollows the postposition. The only exception occurs in the VP, where -nyali
REP almost always appears as an infix between the verbal stem and the
following classifier complex.
      In this section I will first describe its range of meanings, and then go on to
suggest that these all relate to a single formal meaning, which I will attempt to
formalise. In delimiting this range of meanings I do not mean to suggest that
they are all formally distinguishable, or that they are necessarily valid for native
speakers. Some, however, have formal correlates relating to scope, and these
may be assumed to be identified with some justification. It is important to note
that the glosses given below cannot be taken at their face value, and only
PARTICULAR CONTEXTUALISATIONS of them are applicable. For each gloss an
explanation is given which attempts to identify the value of the English word.
No implications should be drawn from the glosses as to further senses of the
Gooniyandi morpheme.
(i) 'again'. As McConvell (1983a) points out, the English word again has two
distinct senses: repetition of an action or fact, or return to a former position or
state. (He shows that these senses are related- see page 468 below.) -Nyali
REP also occurs in both of these senses. (6-31) involves repetition of the full
situation, but in (6-32) there is just a return to a former position; there is no
implication that the bird had previously swooped up.
      (6-31) jamoondoo milanggiddinyayi mila -nyali -yawinggiddinyayi
             other:day    I:saw:you:two      see     REP I:will:cxtend:you:two
             'I saw you two the other day, and I'll see you again later.'
      (6-32) landiwali    woodoolwani thaanoonggoo doombaj -nyali -windi
             from:above it:swooped:up upwards          go:up REP it:got
             '(The bird) swooped down, then went up again.'
      In the 'repetition of an action or fact' sense, -nyali REP is usually, as these
two examples illustrate, attached directly to the verb root or stem, preceding the
classifier complex. For the 'back to a former state or position' it may instead be
attached to a word referring to that state or location. This is shown in example
(6-33):
      (6-33) niyi barnbindi ngiwawoo -nyali
             he    he:retumed south     REP
             'He returned south again.'
Contrast the preceding example, where, if -nyali REP had been attached to
thaanoonggoo 'upwards'. it would indicate that the whole situation (of going            I                                                                                        1
                                     ENCliTICS                                    461
upwards) was repeated.
       All lexical verbs would presumably allow the interpretation of repetition of
the situation. It would seem, however, that only accomplishments allow the
'return to a former position or state' interpretation. For other processes, such as
mila- 'see, look', widdij- 'scratch' and so on, there is no former state or position
to return· to. In fact, this interpretation is likely to be further restricted to a
proper subset of accomplishments, namely those for which the state or location
 is achieved at the point of accomplishment.
       However, -nyali REP has more general senses of repetition of processes
 than does English again, as might be predicted from their different syntagmatic
 potentials. Unlike again which has clausal scope, and consequently refers to the
 repetition of whole situations, -nyali REP may include just the process in its
 scope. In this use only the process is repeated. The participants - their roles or
  their referents- may differ from one situation to the next. (6-34) and (6-35)
  retain the same participants, but show a change in their respective roles; but in
  (6-36) there is a new participant in the second situation.

              'One (man) called to me, and in tum I called back to him.'

              'Had he 1 hit him 2, he 2 would have hit him 1 back in revenge.'","[441, 442, 443, 444, 445]"
"       Thirdly, the expression class which realises the role of Attribute differs
 somewhat depending on whether the clause is verbal or verbless. There are
principled tendencies relating the type of attribute to one or the other clause type
as the most common mode of expression. In general, the more 'concrete' and
 'alienable' an Attribute is, the more it can be construed as an aspect of the mode
of being of the Carrier, and the more likely it is that the attributing clause will
be verbal. For example, locative and associative circumstantial Attributes, are
quite concrete and alienable, and they usually occur in situation clauses. On the
other hand, if the quality is so inherent as to be inseparable from an entity, it is
unlikely to contribute to the mode of being of the entity. Thus qualities such as
colour, size, and shape are infrequent as Attributes in situation clauses (they
occur only when there has been a change in that quality). Likewise when the
Attribute is another entity which is related to the Carrier either as a more
abstract type of 'circumstance', such as purpose, source/origin, comparison, or
possession- clearly such Attributes cannot affect the mode of being of the
Carrier in any significant way. and are never (to the best of my knowledge)
found in Attributive being clauses. In between these limits there are a number of
descriptive Attributes of qualities which are neither inalienable, nor extrinsic to
the object. These are the ones which commonly occur in both situation and
relational clauses. If, on the other hand, we consider Attributes in terms of their
characterising potential, exactly the same pattern emerges: locational, extent, and
312                               THE CLAUSEassociative circumstances characterise an entity least, while inner defining
qualities and extrinsic uses, likenesses, etc. characterise an entity most, leaving
the same residue of more accidental alienable qualities.
      These criteria justify my claim that the verbs of stance do not function as
mere copulas, but as Processes in a distinct clause type, which refers to a mode
of being.
      It is possible to distinguish the following types of clauses of being:
      (1) intensive
      (2) circumstantial
          (a) locative
          (b) extent
          (c) associative
All of these have an inherent Attribute and an inherent Carrier. As has already
been mentioned, there are no processes of being corresponding to identifying
clauses. These types will be dealt with in order below. We will now describe the
five subtypes of Attributive being clauses.
[1] Intensive. All that needs to be added regarding this type is that it allows
two other verballexemes to realise the Process in addition to the three verbs of
posture (and this adds further support to my claim that the verb carries
significant semantic content). The verb ward- 'go' may occur when motion is the
typical characteristic of the Carrier associated with its possession of the
Attribute. For example, stockmen typically move about in the course of their
work:
      (5-46) stockman -loondi     now niyaji -nhingi nganyi
                         !:became then this        ABL       I
             stockman wardngi
                        I went
             'I became a stockman then; after that I was a stockman.'
      The other verb that may occur in being clauses is waba- 'smell, stink'.
Particularly in attributing the quality of rottenness of meat, this verb - and
never one of the stance verbs- appears to be always used.
      (5-47) ngirndaji maa thoowoorndoo wabaari
             this       meat rotten     it:stinks
             'This meat is rotten.'
[2] Circumstantial. There do not exist Attributive circumstantial clauses of
                        THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION                              313
 being corresponding to each type of circumstantial characterising clauses, and
 there is an additional type that occurs in the former but not the latter. We deal
 briefly with the three occurring types below.
 (a) Locative. An example is B's reply in the following exchange:
      (5-48) A: ngoonyi ~ya       ngaanggi garingi
                 which     LOC your        wife
             B: babligaj -ja     warangji
                 pub       LOC she:sat
             A: 'Where's your wife?'
             B: 'She was at the pub.'
(b) Extent. In this type, the Attribute indicates the extent of the Carrier. It is
typically realised by an ALL PP or an adverbial. For example,
      (549) (baall) danggi          ~yidda bagiri
            (road) Geikie:Gorge ALL it:Iies
            '(This road) goes to Geikie Gorge.'
(c) Associative. An example is (5-44) above, in which the birds are claimed to
be in a condition of having names.","[295, 296, 297]"
"      There are certain differences between the clauses which project assertions
                             CLAUSE COMPLEXES                                 415from those which project proposals (see section 5.4.1 above for discussion of
these terms). Proposals appear to always occur with projecting clauses of
'directed action' types (i.e. in either transitive, middle, or reflexive/reciprocal
clauses), in which there is always an addressee. Assertions need not necessarily
occur with 'directed action' projecting clauses. The verbs miga- 'say. do',jag-
'say', baa- 'shout out', and gamalg- 'say' (avoidance style) occur in intransitive
projecting clauses. For example:
     (5-341) migawiddiyi ngarlooddja wardgiddi         barnjawiddiyi
             they:said   thrice      we:will:go        we:will:return
              janoonggoo migayi
              [name]        he:said
              'They said ""Butcher said ""We'll be away for three days"""".'
Another difference is that in clauses projecting proposals, the lexical verb is
normally classified as an accomplishment (see section 6.5.5 below). The only
exception occurs when the present speech act is being referred to by one of the
four verbs just discussed. As
     (5-342) moongayayoo nganyi migangiri -nganggi barnbiri
             tomorrow         I      I:tell     to:you you:will:return
             'I'm telling you ""Come back tomorrow"".'
shows, the process is classified by +1, which marks extendible processes.
Assertions, on the other hand, regularly occur with either accomplishments or
extendibles.
      (b) Projecting clauses may refer to 'factitive' actions which modify the
behaviour of others. There are only a few verbs occurring in this type of clause,
including bala- 'send', ngimbidd- 'hurry (someone) up', and gilij- 'block/prevent
someone from doing something'. The projected clause represents an utterance
that was, might have been, or might be, made in getting the person to do the
action. That is, projected quotes of these verbs are always proposals, never
assertions. Some examples are:
     (5-343) balajila       wayandi gajba           -ngangi
             I:sent:him fire        you:will:cut:it for:us
             'I sent him (saying) ""Cut firewood for us!'"", or 'I sent him to cut
                 firewood.'
     (5-344) baljangga ngimbiddjila        gamba doowwa             -ngangi
              quick      I:hurried:him:up water you:will:get:it for:us
              'I hurried him up: ""Get us water!""', or 'I hurried him up to get us
416                               THE ClAUSE                 water.'
      (5-345) gilijbidi       -ngaddagi mangaddi wardginggirawoo
              they:blocked:it on:me     not         you:are:going!
              'They blocked me ""Don't go!""', or 'They blocked me from going.'
The quote in such constructions may be replaced by an embedded -woo purposive
clause - contrast (5-343) with (5-302), and (5-344) with (5-305) above. (It
appears that the same may hold t~ue for proposals projected by clauses of
communication. There is, however, only one example available; and this involves
the verb jijag- 'speak'.)
      Note that there is no general factitive verb meaning 'make' in Gooniyandi:
the process must be more narrowly specified, either by a verb of communication
or by one of the above few factitive verbs. On the other hand, these lexemes
differ from factitives in that they do not explicitly indicate that the projected
action was in fact done. (This can only be indicated explicitly in a clause
referring independently to this action.)
      Projected quotes give possible linguistic representations of the sense of the
utterance referred to. There is no suggestion of equivalence of wording between
the representation and the actual utterance. For example, there are numerous
instances of texts in which the speech of policemen and other white people is
quoted by means of Gooniyandi clauses, with no suggestion that they spoke the
language (and it is highly unlikely that any did). Consider also (5-346), in which
the thing demanded is referred to in the projecting (and not in the projected)
clause, which is not to say that it was not mentioned in the actual utterance.
      (5-346) ngooddoo -ngga yoowooloo jagmi      -ngaddagi
              that       ERG man          he:told to:me
              ngaoddi -yoo ngangbindi         nganyi
              stone DAT you:will:give:me me
              'That man demanded money of me: ""Give me some!"".'
Gooniyandi direct quotation thus corresponds to both direct and indirect quotation
in English. Each of the examples (5-336) to (5-342) above has an alternative
translation as indirect speech in English. For example, (5-346) could be rendered
into English as 'that man demanded that I give him money'.
      Speech may also be reported INDIRECfLY, although this is far less frequent
than direct report, at least where the projecting clause is one of speech. The
second clause of (5-347) and the frrst clause of (5-348), for example, represent-
indirectly- the content of the communicative event. This is so whether or not
                               CLAUSE COMPLEXES                                  417the two clauses together constitute a single clause complex (or sentence).S
     (5-347) yan.ginba        ngoonyi -yidda wardgiri
             you:will:ask:him where       ALL he:goes
             'Ask him where he is going.'
     (5-348) nginyji yinigama               migama        -ngaddogi
             you      you:will:do:something you:will:tell to:me
             'Tell me what you'll do.'
      Clauses of indirect speech represent the sense of the utterance from the
perspective of the present speech situation. That is, the ongoing speech
situation, and not the one referred to, is the reference point for the deictic
categories of person, tense, and spatial deixis. And it is from this viewpoint that
the 'validity' of the utterance is measured. The distinction between direct and
indirect speech in Gooniyandi, then, does not coincide with the direct/indirect
speech opposition in English. In English the two types contrast in that direct
speech represents the wording of the utterance, and indirect speech represents the
sense (Halliday 1985:230). In Gooniyandi, on the other hand, direct speech
represents the sense of the utterance from the viewpoint of the speech act referred
to, and, as mentioned above, makes no claims about its wording. Gooniyandi
indirect speech represents the sense of the utterance from the viewpoint of the
present speech situation.
      Projected indirect quote clauses as a rule follow the projecting clause. There
are only a couple of instances of the reverse order, and in these cases the
projecting clause seems to be added as a type of afterthought. For example, the
final clause in
      (5-349) ngirndaji -ya     wanyanbiddini I migami -ngiddangi I
              this        LOC they:left:him     he:told to:us
              'They left him here, he told us.'
was added after a pause, and on a different intonation contour, apparently as a
qualification of the status of the first clause as based on report rather than on
direct observation. (Note in addition that the reference point for spatial deixis has
been shifted in the first clause of (5-349) to the speech situation referred to. It is8 In this connection it may be relevant to enquire whether (felicitous) responses
to utterances such as (5-347) and (5-348) respond to the clause of communication
or to the clause representing the utterance communicated, or to either. If the first
(only), this would suggest that the clauses do in fact form a complex together.
Unfortunately, I have no data bearing on this question.
418                                THE ClAUSEnot known whether such shifts normally occur.)
      Another respect in which indirect quotes differ from direct quotes is that the
former are never discontinuous; constituents of the indirect quote always occur
on the one side of the projecting clause (cf. page 413 above).
      I have already mentioned that reported speech is more frequently represented
by direct quotation than by indirect quotation. But there are certain circumstances
in which indirect quotation is the preferred (perhaps even obligatory) mode of
expression. The main circumstances are the following:
      (a) Where there is a conflict between the pronominal categories of the
reported speech situation and the present one such that an interlocutor of the
latter is a third person in the former, indirect quotation tends to be used. That is,
there is a tendency for the speaker to refer to himself and his addressee by a
'personal' - i.e. first or second person form - in preference to a third person
pronominal and/or by name. For example,
      (5-350) migawinmi balanginbidi gilbanginyji mooyoo
              they:told:me they:sent:me I:found:you sleep
              baginggi
              you: slept
              'They told me that I would find you asleep.'
(On the other hand, non-interlocutors in the present speech situation are freely
referred to by first and second person pronominals in direct quotes.)
      (b) Indirect speech frequently occurs where the projected clause takes the
form of a request for information, which the present speaker wishes to be
communicated to himself or herself. That is, the information that the present
speaker requests is information requested by, or communicated to someone else,
who is the (present) addressee, in the examples available. Examples are (5-347)
ax!
      (5-351) ngooddoo -ngga yoowooloo yinigami                 -nganggi
              that       ERG man               he:did:something to:you
              ngoonyi -yidtltl wardgiri
              where    ALL he:goes
              Where did that man tell you he's going?'
Although there is a direct quote corresponding to (5-347) which presumably
differs in the respect that the present speaker is not, directly at least, requesting
the information that will be conveyed to the hearer, there is no corresponding
direct quote for (5-351). The reported speech in this case cannot be represented
                              CLAUSE COMPLEXES                                 419
from the viewpoint of the speech situation referred to. (5-348) is a special case,
in which, however, the speaker and the hearer are still the interlocutors and a
different 'turn' of the conversation is being referred to, in which their roles are
reversed. Again, there is no corresponding direct quote for (5-348).
      (c) Where the projecting clause is a 'command' which the present speaker
wishes relayed to someone, usually with the addressee acting as an intennediary,
indirect quotation predominates over direct quotation. Examples are:
     (5-352) lanis -ngga migami -ngadda nginyji -ga
             [name] ERG he:said to:me you              ERG
             migami -nhi      Martin -joo niyi -ngga doowyawina
             he:said to:him            DAT that ERG he:will:gecme

             I        upstream he:will:get:me      [place name] ABL
             'Lanis told me ""Tell Martin to come up and get me and take me
                from Moolooddja"".'
     (5-353) jagma         -nhi      wardjawi niyaji balawa
             you:will:tell to:him he:will:go this    you:will:send:him
             'Tell him to go; send him away.'
As for (b), the utterance does not just report on, and refer to another utterance -
in which case direct quotation is the norm. Rather, the (linguistic and non-
linguistic) response to the second utterance is of concern to the present speaker,
who is the ultimate source of the command, or of the request for information.
      (d) The avoidance style lexeme gamalg- 'say, tell' projects both direct and
indirect quotes. Direct quotation typically occurs when the individual to be
avoided is a participant in the speech situation referred to, whilst indirect
quotation typically occurs when the avoidance-category kinsman is an
interlocutor in the present speech act. By making use of indirect speech in this
circumstance, the utterance reported on is presented from the present perspective,
and so is lexicalised with avoidance-style items. This is as might be expected,
granted that more circumspection is necessary in face-to-face contact with an
avoidance-kinsmen than in reference him/her (cf. section 1.5). For example,
     (5-354) gamalgma       -nhi    giddbiwi       -ngadda yilgawina
             you:will:tell to:him he:will:come to:me he:will:see:me
             'Tell him to come and see me.' (speaker to WMB)
     (5-355) ngaanggi ngaliganyi gamalgmi -ngadda moongamoongaya
             your     son        he:told   to:me tomorrow
420                                THE ClAUSE              yilgawingga     ngaligany -badi -ngga
              he:will:see:you son        your ERG
              'Your son told me he'd see you tomorrow.' (speaker to WM(B),
                 etc.)
Note that the choice of indirect speech in these two utterances may also be
motivated by factor (a); however, this additional motivation is not always
present
      To summarise, indirect speech represents the utterance from the viewpoint
of the present speech situation. It is normally chosen to highlight an aspect of
the relevance of the reported speech act to the present speech situation. Direct
speech represents the spoken word from the viewpoint of the situation in which
it occurred, and relationships to the present speech act are played down. In
general, direct and indirect quotations occur in distinct linguistic environments.
There appear to be relatively few contexts in which the speaker makes a
meaningful choice between the two.","[398, 399, 400, 401, 402, 403, 404]"
"6.5.3.2 Potential mode
 The potential mode evaluates a situation as an as yet unrealised possibility,
 given the surrounding circumstances: it indicates that the situation could or
 might occur, or might have occurred in the circumstances, but didn't in fact
  .~
                               VERBAL CATEGORIES                                  533occur, or hasn't as yet occurred. That is, the occurrence of the situation is/was
expected, and ascertained to be a potentiality, based on the speaker's evaluation
of the real world circumstances. It has nothing at all to do with the speaker's
lack of knowledge or uncertainty concerning the occurrence or future occurrence
of the situation (which is indicated by yiganyi 'uncertain'- see section 6.4.5).
Indeed, in the speaker's opinion the situation has not yet occurred, or will only
occur in the future given certain conditions. The potential occurs with the two
[+unrealised] tenses only, the irrealis and the future. I will discuss these in order
below.
(a) Irreali~ potential. This combination indicates that in the speaker's
estimation the situation could have happened - there were signs that it might
come into being - but it didn't A number of specific senses may be identified
depending on the nature of the signs. The main ones (as far as I have been able
to detennine them) are:
      (i) An unsuccessful attempt was made by the Actor to perform the action:
      (6..248) bariyoondirni            marlami bithami
               he:might:have:climbed not          he:got:stiff
               'He tried to climb up, but couldn't. He was too stiff.'
To indicate that the attempt very nearly succeeded, the particle wambawoo
'nearly' may be used -see example (6~190).
      (ii) The Actor did not attempt to effect the action, but it nearly occurred
anyway - usually through momentary clumsiness or carelessness, for which
the necessary physical or mental adjustments were made in time. Such
situations, which the Actor does not attempt to bring about, are normally
undesirable in some way. In this sense, the particle wambawoo 'nearly' nonnally
occurs (see above section 6.4.14). Some examples are:
      (6-249) wambawoo gilangginaddirni
               nearly       it:might:have:knocked:me
               '(fhe car) nearly knocked me.'
      (6-250) wambawoo gamba -ya              dinggilyanirni
               nearly         water LOC it:might:have:immersed
               gamba -ya         yalawa doowla
               water LOC close I:got:it
               'It nearly fell into the water, but I grabbed it close by the water.'
      (iii) It looked as though the situation would occur, except that something
intervened to prevent it. For example,
534                          TOPICS IN SEMANfiCS      (6-251) giddgiddyanirni        balyjangga -nyali doowla
              it:mighthave:rolled quickly         REP I:got:it
              'I grabbed it before it rolled down the bank.'
      (iv) The Actor desired the situation, but something intervened to prevent
him/her from doing it:
      (6-252) yaanya thangarndi jaggilimirni           nyinlimi
              other word           I:mighthave:said l:forgot:it
              'I was going to tell another story, but I forget it.'
     (v) An inanimate Actor nearly effects the situation: (6-249), (6-250),
(6-251)and
      {6-253) wambawoo giddayarni                waddamba ~ga
              nearly       it:might:have:run:it flood      ERG
              'The flood nearly washed it away.'
     (vi) Had some other situation occurred (which might have occurred), the
unrealised situation would have. That is, as mentioned in section 5.6.2.1.3, the
potential mode indicates the consequent of a counterfactual conditional. (5-397)
is one example. In the following example, the antecedent condition is implicit.
It was mentioned in the preceding discourse.
      (6-254) wardngirni           .milaalarni
               I:might:have:gone I:might:have:seen:him
               '(Had you told me) I would have gone and seen him.'
     (vii) Under normal conditions the situation would have occurred, but an
unforeseen contingency prevented it:
      (6-255) boo/oogoo ~ngga garingi         ngangyirni
               [name]      ERG wife         he:might:have:given: him
               'B. would have given him (his daughter as) a wife (but she died).'
      (viii) The Actor did not get around to doing the action, though nothing
prevented him/her (so s/he could have done it). Nonnally speaking, there is an
implicit suggestion that although the action did not occur, it would have been
better that it did. This use of the potential translates into English as 'should' or
'ought'. Examples are:
       (6-256) jamoondoo wajgiladdirni              maa
               other:day     I:might:have:thrown:it meat
               'I should have thrown the meat out the other day.'

     (6-257) manyi yan.ginngindi     wardgilarninganggi
              food      you:asked:me I:might:have:brought:it:for:you
              marlami
               not
               'Yon asked me for bread. I should have brought you some.•
      (ix) The speaker believed at an earlier time that the situation would occur,
though it turned out not to. (And this belief was founded on evidence.) In this
case, thaddi 'mistakenly believed' can occur with the irrealis potential. See
section 6.4.4 for examples.
      I do not claim that these nine senses have linguistic significance as covert
categories, and they are clearly not disjoint. There are, no doubt, many more
contextualisations of this category that have not yet appeared in the corpus.
They are all specific contextualisations of the general meaning that the process
was a potentiality. The specific contextualisations, however, are likely to be of
more significance to the interlocutors than this abstract core meaning - and not
all senses are glossed by native speakers in the same way.
      The ·potential mode has, as has been mentioned already, the full situation
referred to by the clause in its scope, not just the Process (referred to by the VP).
But when the clause is modified by a Propositional Modifier, the potential is
contained within the scope of that Modifier. In particular, the potential is
contained within the scope of mangaddi 'no, not' in negated clauses. A negated
potential clause is consistent with both the occurrence and the non-uccurrence of
the situation - since a clause in the potential logically implies the negation of
the clause in the past tense: i.e. the situation did not occur. Depending on which
of these obtainst whether the situation occurred or did not occur, the potential
mode in negated clauses has two distinct sets of contextual senses.
       (A) In case the situation occurred, a potential clause may be negated to
 indicate that although it occurred, the situation was not evaluated as a
potentiality in the circumstances. There are three major reasons why the actual
might not be evaluated as potential:
       (A-i) The Actor did not attempt to do it; s/he did it unintentionally,
 without trying. For example,
      (6-258) mangaddi niyi      -binyi wardyirni              daddgbani
               not        that    PER he:might:have:gone he:fell
               'He didn't mean to go that way (i.e. to step on the glass); (but) he
                  fell (on it).'
      (A-ii) The situation would not have occurred had some other situation
536                           TOPICS IN SEMANTICSoccurred. This is a counterfactual, the negative of sense (vi) above. See example
(5-398).
     (A-iii) The situation occurred unnecessarily - it need not have, and should
not have occurred. For example,
       (6-259) mangaddi jagyimirni                ngaddanyi -yoo
               not       he:might:have:spoken mother         DAT
               'He needn't talk to his mother like that'
     (B) In case the situation did not occur, the negation of the potential has the
effect of indicating that, not only didn't the situation occur, but it was not
expected to occur. The main contextualisations are:
     (B-i) The Actor did not even try to do the action, which did not occur. For
example,
       (6-260) mangaddi doowyarni
 •             not          he:might:have:got:it
               'He didn't try to get (the beer he'd dropped into the flooded creek).'
       (6-261) mangaddi wardyirni            boolga nhoongjinga
               not      he:might:have:gone old:man by:himself
               The old man wouldn't attempt to cross the flooded creek alone.'
       {B-ii) The Actor did not even want to do it:
       (6-262) mangaddi diribyoondirni
               not         he:might:have:gone:in
               'He didn't want to go in (and he didn't).'
       (B-iii) The Actor didn't nearly achieve his goal; s/he missed out by a long
way.
       (6-263) ngaaddi wajladdi mangaddi gardgooloonirni
               stone I:threw:it not              I:might:have:hit:him
               'I threw the stone, but didn't nearly hit him.'
    (B-iv) The Actor didn't undertake the action because of other- personal or
social- considerations:
       (6~264) mangaddi     nganggilirni             maa ngaddagi
                not         I:might:have:given:him meat my
                'I wouldn't give it to him; it's my meat.'
A comparison of the contextualisations reveals that two senses of the potential
are negated in each context. They are: sense (i), that the Actor tired to do it,
                                                              !
                               VERBAL CATEGORIES                                   537
giving (A-i) and (B-i); and sense (viii), that no convention or circumstance stood
in the way of the Actor doing the action, which gives rise to (A-iii) and (B-iv).
What is consistently negated is the potentiality of the situation, not its
occurrence. (A-i) and (B-i) deny that any attempt was made; (A-iii) and (B-iv) deny
that there was no constraint on the Actor inhibiting him from performing. This
might be seen as further evidence in support of the claim that this category has
the full clause in its scope.
      It is likely that other senses are also capable of being negated in both
contexts, given appropriate speech situations. For example, one would expect that
next to (ii) (that the situation nearly occurred), there would be a contextualisation
'didn't nearly occur, but really occurred with plenty of leeway' in addition to (B-iii)
'didn't nearly occur, but missed by a long way'.(b) Future potential. The future potential evaluates a situation as potential in
the future, again on circumstantial evidence. In this case, the circumstantial
evidence is what the speaker imagines will be the circumstances, or possible
circumstances at the time when the situation is expected to occur. That is, the
speaker evaluates the situation as likely to occur should circumstances be
suitable. There is always a defmite temporal location in mind. Unlike the plain
future tense, and the subjunctive future, the future potential is never used in
predicting future occurrences. Its projection into the future is tempered by a
qualification that the future occurrence of the situation is contingent upon factors
out of the control of the speaker and/or Actor.
      Thus it is frequently found as the consequence in future conditionals. For
example,
      (6-265) jaddi mar/ami wardhingirni
              if      nothing I:could:go
              'If nothing, I'll come back (here)~'
(Note: such clauses indicate the potentiality of the future situation given another
situation. This parallels the irrealis potential in the counterfactual construction.)
      The condition need not be made explicit:
      (6-266) wardbingirni yaningi       -yoo
               l:could:go    now          DAT
               'I could go soon.'
      (6-267) monday -moowa wardbingirni -nganggi
                         ON     I:could:go    to:you
              'I can only come on Mondays.' (That is, only on Mondays am I
                  able to come- the other days there is no lift available.)
      Clauses with the future potential are frequently modified by Propositional
538                         TOPICS IN SEMANTICSModifiers~ primarily mangaddi 'no, not', marlami 'not', and yiganyi 'uncertainr.
As for the irrealis potential, in negated clauses what is asserted is that the
situation is not a significant potentiality given the expected circumstances: it is
judged highly unlikely to occur (in these circumstances). Typically it strongly
denies that the Actor would make any attempt to bring the situation about, no
matter how easy or tempting it would be for him to do so, in the circumstances.
This strong denial of intention is clear in
      (6-268) mangaddi diribbingirni nhoowoo ngooddoo -yoo mayaroo
              not         I:could:enter his          that     DAT house
              'I wouldn't think of going in; it's his house.'
It is likely that the other types of potentiality identified above for the irrealis
potential also occur in the future; the lack of examples is probably a reflection of
the limited corpus.
      There is some evidence that when yiganyi 'uncertain' contains a clause in
the future potential in its scope, what is being asserted is that the potentiality of
the situation is not certain (given the surrounding conditions). The following
pair of examples lend support to this interpretation:
      (6-269) yiganyi barnbingirni moolooddja -yidda
              uncertain I:could:retum [name]           ALL
              'I might return to Mulurrja (sc. if I can get someone to take me).'
      (6-270) ngaja           yiganyi bijboowarnirni wamba mangaddi
              younger:brother uncertain he:could:emerge later     not
              nganyi binaddi
              I       knowledgeable
              'My younger brother might come soon; I don't know.'
(6-270) occurred in a context in which the potentiality of the speaker's brother's
arrival was uncertain. The speaker had not heard from his brother for some time,
and did not know what he had been doing, or the circumstances surrounding his
actions.
      The potential mode seems to normally occur in assertions, and only rarely
in proposals. The only instances of the potential in proposals are of the irrealis
potential being used as a type of indirect post hoc command to the effect that the
addressee shouldn't do (again) something that s/he has done, or should do
something that s/he hasn't done. Thus:
                              VERBAL CATEGORIES                                539     (6-271) mangaddi jagjimirni        ngaddanyi -yoo
             not        you:could:say mother        DAT
             'You shouldn't talk to your mother (like that).'
(Compare (6-259) above.)6.5.3.3 Definite mode
The definite mode is realised by the enclitic -woo DEF, which, as has been
mentioned already, is not restricted to occurring in VPs. Definite mode occurs
with the three tenses past, present and future, but not, apparently, with the
irrealis. It indicates that the speaker evaluates and asserts the occurrence of the
situation - at a past, present, future or unspecified time - as definite or
certain. As was the case for the potential, this evaluation would appear to be
based on the speaker's assessment of the surrounding circumstances, and their
likely outcome.
      If the potential and desiderative modes are typically associated with
assertions and proposals respectively, the definite mode finds an unmarked
association with exclamations (see section 6.5.1.3 above). The defmite can occur
in exclamations with each of the three tenses. As distinct from, the expletive
type of exclamation mentioned earlier in connection with the unmodalised future
tense, these exclamations are of a type that draws attention to the occurrence of
the situation - just as occurs when -woo is encliticised to nominal
constituents, drawing attention to the existence of some entity or place (see
section 6.3.9). Examples in the three tenses are, respectively,
      (6·272) gilbala      -woo
              I:found:it DEF
              'I found it!'
      (6·273) thithi    wardngira -woo
              going     I:go       DEF
               'I'm going!'
      (6-274) nginyji wardbira    -woo
              you     you:will:go DEF
              'You can go!'
     The definite mode occurs but rarely in combination with the past and future
tenses. The handful of examples of these combinations are all used as
exclamations, and little more can be said about the combinations. But there are
numerous examples of the combination with the present; this combination is
540                         TOPICS 1N SEMANTICSnot restricted to exclamations and shows an interesting range of uses.
      (a) Exclamations. Firstly, in exclamations, the speaker may draw
attention to a situation that is going on at the present time. Fo:t example,
(6-273) above COULD be uttered whilst the speaker is in motion. But more
usually, the situation is not one which has already started, but, rather, it is one
which is about to start (if it is an extendible), or about to occur (if it is an
accomplishment). Thus, a more likely circumstance in which (6-273) might be
uttered is just as the speaker is about to take his/her leave. And (6-275) refers to
an imminent accomplishment:
      (6-275) gamba -ya      yimininyganoo -woo
              water LOC he:drowns           DEF
              'He'll drown in the water!'
      (b) Assertions. A clause such as (6-275) (and probably also (6-273)) may
be uttered as an assertion, in which case the speaker merely states that the
occurrence is imminent. The present progressive - yimininygoowaani 'he is (in
the process of) drowning' - could be used to describe the same events (see
6.5.2). But it would not carry the same sense of urgency as (6-275), and would
probably be unlikely as an exclamation. Secondly, by comparison with the
'future time' sense of the plain present, the present definite suggests that the
situation is far closer to actualisation and threatens to occur. Furthermore, the
situation is usually seen as undesirable in some sense (as in (6-275), and see
also examples below).
      When a clause in the present definite is negated, the speaker is normally
denying that the situation is about to occur, and thus, by suggestion, that the
Actor has any intention of doing the act - or in fact that there is any chance
that s/he will do it. For example,
      (6-276) mangaddi wardgaddoo -woo
              not       we:go        DEF
              'We won't go', or 'We don't want to go.'
      (6-277) mangaddi diribngira -woo mangaddi ngaddagi mayaroo
              not         !:enter       DEF not           my           house
              'I won't go in (there is no chance I'll go in); it's not my house. •
At first glance sentences such as these, which seem to strongly deny the
occurrence of the situation, would appear to involve a switch in meaning from the
expected 'not definite' to 'defmitely not'. However, to assume this would be to
confuse the type of definiteness of the Gooniyandi category with the meaning of
the English word definite. The defmiteness at stake here, as has been mentioned
                               VERBAL CATEGORIES                                  541
above, is based on an evaluation of the circumstances: thus the preceding two
example sentences claim that the evaluation of the situations 'we are going' and 'I
am going inside' (respectively) as defmite - that they are imminent and threaten
to occur - is mistaken. These sentences do not claim that the non-occurrence of
the situation is inevitable or imminent. Thus it seems that the apparent strong
denial in (6-276) and (6-277) is illusory: rather, it is a strong claim that is being
denied.
      This analysis is further strengthened by an example of a slightly different
type, which involves the generic sense, instead of the present time sense of the
present tense. The clause
      (6-278) mangaddi milaa         -woo
                not       he:sees:it DEF
was elicited in response to 'he doesn't see well'. It is evident that this clause does
NOT assert that the speaker evaluates the Actor as defmitely or certainly unable to
see anything. What is asserted is the negation of milaawoo 1 evaluate the facts as
indicating that he sees (anything)'. Clearly here it is the strong claim - that he
sees well (i.e. everything around) - that is being negated.
     But the most frequent use of the present definite is in the lest construction
discussed in section 5.6.2.1.3. Another example is
      (6-279) mirlimirli -ya     yoodbidi.       wangaddagganoo -woo
              paper        LOC we:will:put:it it:gets:lost       DEF
              'We'll put the words on paper lest they get lost:
In a paratactic clause complex in which the logical relationship between the
clauses is 'if-then', the consequent may be marked by the present definite,
especially if it is undesirable. (The antecedent is in the irrealis potential.) For
example,                                                       ·
      (6-280) diribngirni           wamba nirdnganoo -woo
              I:might:have:entered later     !:stick        DEF
              'I might have gone in, (in which case) I'd still be stuck.'
     There is a single example in the corpus of yet another variant of the
conditional, in which the ANTECEDENT is in the present definite:
      (6-281) ngiddinyi diribgondoo -woo nirdgani
              fly        it:enters     DEF it:gets:stuck
              'The fly goes in (the honey) and he's stuck.'
     (c) Proposals. As a proposal a clause in present definite with ftrst person
Actor usually constitutes a threat.
542                           TOPICS IN SEMANTICS      (6-282) nyagginyboo -woo
              I:spear:you      DEF
              '(Careful or) I'll spear you.'
      (6-283) thoolnglimi -nhi     nanggidlooni wamba gardginyboo -woo
              !:kicked      at:him I:missed:him later      I:hit:you        DEF
              '(Although) I missed when I kicked at him, I'll still hit you.'
What is involved in this type of threat is that unless the addressee modifies
his/her behaviour appropriately, an undesirable (for him/her) consequence will
ensue. A clause may occur expressing the type of action that the addressee
should take to avoid this consequence. The resulting sentence is then a lest type~
used as a proposal.
     In case the addressee is an undergoer and the Actor is a third person~ it will
probably be a warning to him or her:
      (6-284) moodiga milawa            ngzny}l -rni. gilangginggaddoo -woo
              car     you:will:see:it you        SEQ it:knocks:you      DEF
              Watch out or the car will knock you.'
Finally, in case the Actor is a third person, and the clause does not involve the
addressee, as in (6-275), the purpose may be to elicit intervention from the
hearer- in this case, to help the person out of the water.
      In proposals, the present definite most frequently occurs in negated clauses
functioning as negative commands - commands to desist from doing, and
commands not to do. For example,
      (6-285) mangaddi goomboorna bijginyjarnoo -woo
              not      early      you:come       DEF
               'Don't come early.'
       (6-286) wilawoo gadboo             wayandi mangaddi gajginyja -woo
               finish   you:will:leave:it fire     not      you:cut:it DEF
               'Enough. Stop. Don't cut any more frrewood.'
     As is the case for positive commands, the negative command need not have
a second person Actor. These usually have a sense 'don't let' or 'don't allow',
requesting that the hearer try to prevent the event from occurring. For example,
       (6-287) mangaddi maa ngabga -woo
               not         meat he:eats:it DEF
               'Don't let him eat the meat.'
                              VERBAL CATEGORIES                                 543(As above, the negative command involves the negation of a 'strong' possibility
(that the situation will occur), not the evaluation of the situation as non-
occurring.)
      These uses of the present definite may be explained in terms of the analysis
of the present tense presented in section 6.5.1.5. Roughly, in using the defmite
mode in combination with the present tense the speaker evaluates the occurrence
of the situation as definite or certain, on the basis of factual evidence of the
surrounding conditions, etc .. However, s/he does not assert a particular temporal
or realisation value for it - s/he does not assert it to be anterior or posterior to
the present time, nor realised or unrealised as of the time of the speech situation.
The main possibilities, as outlined for the present tense (section 6.5.1.2), occur
also with the present definite: present time, which appears to occur in
exclamations only; future time, in all three speech act types, referring to
imminent occurrences; generic, in assertions (see example (6-289)); and
hypothetical, in conditional constructions (example (6-281)).
      In accordance with a general principle that the speaker will normally make
the strongest assertion consistent with the facts as s/he understands them, the
speaker uses the present definite only if s/he believes the process not to be both
realised (i.e. [-unrealised]) and [+anterior]- in which case past tense would be
used; or [+unrealised] and [-anterior] - in which case the future tense would be
used. In other words, use of the present definite is nonnally concurrent with the
speaker's belief that the process has not yet occurred (in which case it would
belong to the past), and that it is not a projection into the future. This explains
why, as remarked in section 5.6.2.1.3, the apprehensional construction does not
occur if the situation against which the avoidance action was taken did in fact
occur. If, however, the situation to be avoided did not occur in the past, the
 present definite clause may refer to it, the present tense being marked as
[~anterior].
      Unless there is some possibility or suggestion to the contrary - that the
situation is NOT certain to occur- the present tense will not be marked as
definite. Where reference is being made to a presently on-going situation, this
presumably invokes a contrast with the possibility that it is not occurring. More
interesting is the future time sense, where the definite marking, paradoxically,
suggests that the situation need not in fact occur. The situation is evaluated as
definite, given certain circumstances. The implicit suggestion is that if one (or
more) of these circumstances is changed the occurrence is no longer assured.
Thus there can be an ""out"" whereby the undesired situation may be avoided, as in
the 'lest', 'threat/warning', and 'indirect command' uses.
544                          TOPICS IN SEMANTICS6.5.4 Mood
6.5.4.1 Subjunctive mood
The use of subjunctive mood - realised by the verbal enclitic -ja- - in
subordinate clauses has been discussed already, in section 5.6.2.1.3 above. The
subjunctive is not, however, restricted to occurring in subordinate clauses, and is
frequently found in independent clauses in the unreal tenses (future and irrealis);
the combination with real tenses (past and present) is rare in independent clauses.
It follows that the Gooniyandi subjunctive is not primarily a device for marking
the subordinate status of the· clause, as the subjunctive appears to be in
languages such as French (Lyons 1968:312).
       Two major uses of the subjunctive can be identified in independent clauses.
Firstly, there is the interpersonal use in which it is asserted or proposed (in the
sense of 5.4.1) that the proposition expressed by the clause is hypothesised,
supposed, reckoned, wished, hoped, claimed, or whatever. In other words, the
difference between an unmodalised clause and the clause in the subjunctive is
parallel to the difference between P and 1-P (cf. Mendelson 1964:30, McCawley
 1981:39), and -ja- SUBJ functions like the operator 1-. This means that the
speaker is not uttering a proposition about the world, but a proposition about a
proposition about the world. This use of the subjunctive translates into English
as 'I assert, claim, hypothesise, predict, hope, know, wish, declare, reckon, (etc.)
 that P', or 'let's suppose, hypothesise, assume, (etc.) that P'. This interpersonal
 use also occurs in conditional hypotactic clause complexes, in which the
 antecedent clause - which refers to the hypothesised condition - occurs in
 subjunctive mood (section 5.6.2.1.3).
       Secondly, there is an experiential use, in which the subjunctive 'operator'
 becomes a part of the experiential meaning conveyed. That is, the speaker asserts
 that someone hypothesises, supposes, reckons, wishes, hopes, or claims (etc.)
 the proposition to be the case. This involves a further 'embedding' of the
 proposition: i.e. the speaker asserts (someone asserts or proposes (it is
 hypothesised/believed/entertained/hoped (etc.) that P)). Compare the two uses,
 experiential and interpersonal, of the particles yiganyi 'uncertain' and thaddi
 'mistakenly believed'- see sections 6.4.5 and 6.4.4 respectively.
       In the following two subsections I will examine the contextual meanings
 of the subjunctive in independent clauses, discussing first the senses that arise in
 assertions, then those which arise in proposals. In these subsections, each tense
 combination will be taken in tum. It is important to stress that there is no
 suggestion that the senses identified below are linguistically significanL
                              VERBAL CATEGORIES                               5456.5.4.1.1 Subjunctive mood in assertions
[1] Future subjunctive. In independent clauses, the subjunctive is most
often found with the future tense, and a considerable proportion of independent
clauses in the corpus - I would estimate around a quarter to a third - which
project into future time, are in the subjunctive mood. The following contextual
senses are attested. Of course, it should be borne in mind that each example is
open to multiple interpretations; I give the interpretation appropriate to the
situation in which the example occurred, together with brief remarks on that
situation.
      (a) Interpersonal. Here, as I have already said, the speaker asserts a
claim, hypothesis, or whatever, not a proposition.
      (a~i) Predictions. It has already been mentioned (section 6.5.1.3) that the
use of the plain future tense makes a claim to the occurrence of a situation at a
given point of time in the future, or otherwise immediately. Furthennore, it has
a far stronger sense than merely predicting that a situation will occur, and as I
have said, it is never used in making general non-time-bound predictions (section
6.5.1.3). The subjunctive future is used when the speaker does not subscribe
strongly to the future occurrence of the situation; s/he sees it as subject to some
uncertainty. This is normally because s/he does not have adequate factual
evidence on which to base the statement: s/he is simply guessing, or predicting
that it will happen. In the following example the speaker was merely predicting
what I would do after I left him.
      (6~288) babligaj -nhingi ngilanggoo     halma yoowarni
               pub       ABL     east         creek one
               thood   --ja     ~winggani
               OOscend SUBJ      FUT+(2sg)N+ANI
               'From the pub you'll go east, and cross one creek.'
Another example is the second clause of the paratactic clause complex in
example (6-181).
      (a-ii) Truths. The subjunctive future may be used in reference to future
certainties, which, however, the speaker is unable or unwilling to locate
temporally. For example, in the Kimberley region~ which has a well defined wet
season, everyone takes it for granted that the rivers will regularly rise and fall
throughout the season. However, exactly when events such as described in
(6~289) will occur can't be known for sure.
546                           TOPICS IN SEMANTICS      (6-289) waddamba yawimbiddi -ya           -wani       birij -ja
              flood      recem         SUBJ FUT+ANI bridge LOC
              'The floodwater will eventually recede from the bridge.'
     (a-iii) Claims. The speaker may use the subjunctive in making a claim
about the future (concerning an event which is neither a truth, nor a prediction).
For example,
      (6-290) ian   lm1'd -ja      -wi       thithi
                     go     SUBJ FUT+I going
              1an will be going (sometime).'
This clause has been classified as a claim since at the time it was uttered, the
speaker had only hearsay evidence (from the individual himself) that Ian would
shortly be leaving the district. The claimed situation may by temporally
unlocated or located:
      (6-291) yaningi ngaaddi      ngang   -ja       -wzny}e.
              now       stone      give     SUBJ FUT+(lsg)N+(2sg)A+DI
              '(I claim that) I'm going to give you money now.'
      (6-292) yaningi -nyali      mooyoo bagi -ya           -wingani
               now      REP sleep         lie       SUBJ FUT+(lsg)N+ANI
               l'm ready to go to sleep.'
      (a-iv) Guesses or suppositions. The speaker need not subscribe as strongly
to the occurrence of the situation as to predict it: s/he may just guess, suppose,
hope"" or entertain it as a possibility; it need have no factual basis. (Compare the
potential mode, which indicates an evaluation based on the surrounding
circumstances -see section 6.5.3.2). For instance,
       (6~293) niyaji   -ya   warang -ja         -wooddi  -ddi
               this     LOC sit         SUBJ FUT+(3pl)N+I pa
               yoowarni -ya       wik
               one         LOC week
               'I guess/think they'll stay until next week.'
       (b) Experiential. (b-i) Desire. The future subjunctive may be used to
 suggest that the actor desires or wishes the situation to occur, but for various
 reasons s/he may be unable or unwilling to immediately engage in it. An
 example is
                                VERBAL CATEGORIES                               547     (6-294) Jack -ngga mila -ya            -wingga
                    ERG see        SUBJ FUT+(2sg)A+A
              'Jack wants to see you.'
Where the actor is the speaker, it is impossible to decide whether the speaker is
expressing his desire (as a fact), or a wish (as an interpersonal modality).
Examples such as line (51) of Text 1 could be interpreted either way, as can
     (6-295) bithawaalimi         mooyoo bagi -ya          -wingani
             I:am:getting:stiff sleep       lie    SUBJ PUT+(lsg)N+l
             'I'm getting stiff, and want to go to sleep.'
As usual, it need not be the actor who desires the situation:
     (6-296) niyi    -ngga   lmrd -ja  -wina
              he     ERG take SUBJ FUT+(lsg)A+A
              'I want him to take me.'
     Negation of a clause in the subjunctive future usually suggests that there is
no desire to do the action:
      (6-297) mangaddi mila -ya          -winya
              not         see     SUBJ FUT+(lsg)N/(2sg)A+A
               'I don't want to see you.'
     (b-ii) Attempt. There may be a suggestion that the actor will try to do the
action. Thus,
      (6-298) lambardi -ngga thaanoonggoo doow -ya   -wa
              child     ERG up            get   SUBJ FUT+(3sg)N+A
was offered in response to the English prompt 'The child will reach up and try to
get it'.
      (b-iii) Ability. In a couple of examples the particle yiganyi •uncertain' calls
to question the ability of the actor to effect the process. For example,
      (6-299) gool -ya       ..wili            yiganyi   dirib -ja
              try     SUBJ FUT+(lsg)N+Dl uncertain enter SUBJ
              -wzngz              jaddi marlami barnbingirni
               FUT+(lsg)N+I if          nothing I:could:retwn
              'I'll try. I'm not certain ru be able to get in. If not, I'll come
                   back.'
My explanation for this apparently unrelated sense of the subjunctive is that the
speaker is here indicating his uncertainty towards the proposition that he will be
548                         TOPICS IN SEMANTICSable to effect the action. Note that in all cases in which this sense occurs the
action for which ability is claimed is not located at a definite point of time in
the future.
[2] Irrealis subjunctive. The irrealis tense combines with the subjunctive
mood as well as the potential mode. The irrealis subjunctive and the irrealis
potential contrast as follows. The irrealis potential implies that the speaker has
evaluated the circumstances surrounding the unreallsed situation, and concluded
that it might have occurred in the nonnal run of things, had things gone right,
whereas the irrealis subjunctive requires no such factual basis. It merely asserts,
claims, hypothesises (etc.) the proposition that the situation might have
occurred when it didn't. There need be no evidence backing up this hypothesis -
though presumably it will normally be something which is not logically
impossibly. For example, in uttering
      (6-300) yoowooloo -ngga marni -wa gard -ja              ""yooni
              man         ERG sister his hit SUBJ IRR+BINI
              'The man might have hit his sister (though I know he didn't).'
the speaker merely supposes that the man might have hit his sister ('I suppose
he might have hit her'). But had the irrealis potential gardyoonirni occurred
instead, it would indicate that there were definite signs that the situation was
going to occur. The contextual meanings overlap with those identified for the
future subjunctive, and include the following.
       (a) Supposition or claim. An example is (6-300) above.
       (b) Obligation. Use of the irrealis subjunctive as a plain independent
supposition is decidedly rare. Either it is followed by a clause indicating a
consequence of the supposition (see section 5.6.2.1.3), or there is a suggestion
 that the supposed situation OUGHT to have occurred - that it would have been
better that it did occur. (6-300) would usually suggest that the man ought to
 have hit his sister. Thus:      (6-301) maa thoowoorndoo waj          -ja     --aladdi
              meat rotten           throw SUBJ ffiR+(lsg)N+ADDI
              marlami
              nothing
              'I could (and should) have thrown out the rotten meat, but I didn't
                  bother.'
                              VERBAL CATEGORIES                               549
     (6-302) l1-tll""d -ja    -ala             -nganggi nyinlimi
             bring SUBJ IRR+(lsg)N+A on:you !:forgot
             'I could (and should) have brought you food, but I forgot to.'
But this sense of the irrealis subjunctive, i.e. counterfactual supposition, is
more naturally proposed than asserted, particularly if the actor is the addressee.
The suggestion of obligation is still present: the bearer ought to do the action.
     (c) Desire. The actor may have wanted to, or thought of engaging in the
action, but for some reason did not. There is no suggestion that s/he made any
attempt to act. For example,
     (6-303) ngab -ja      -ala                milala yaanya yoowooloo
             eat     SUBJ IRR+(lsg)N+A I:saw:it other man
             gadlooni
             I:left:it
             'I wanted to eat it, but saw the other man (whose food it was), and
                 left it.
     (6-304) dirih -ja       -yoondi      yoowayi        nirdganoo -woo
              enter SUBJ IRR+BINDI he:was:afraid he:sticks DEF
              'He wanted to go inside but was afraid of getting stuck.'
In contrast to the irrealis potential, there is no suggestion in (6-303) that the
speaker tried, or made any move towards eating the food, and no suggestion in
(6..304) that any attempt or move towards effecting the action was made.
      As is the case for negated irrealis potential clauses - and for the same
reasons - a negated irrealis subjunctive clause is consistent with both the
occurrence and the non-occurrence of the situation. There are no examples of the
irrealis subjunctive in negated independent clauses where the situation occurred
- but cf. example (5-398). But when the situation did not occur, the negation
of the irrealis subjunctive strengthens the negative sense, indicating that not
only did the process not occur, but it could not, or would not occm: the speaker
holds it as a virtual impossibility. In effect, it is denied that the occurrence of
the situation is entertained or suggested, or that the actor wanted to do it. The
following examples illustrate the latter, experiential sense:
      (6-305) mangaddi gard -ja          -alooni
              not        hit SUBJ IRR+(lsg)N+BINI
              'I wouldn't hit him.' (I had no intention of doing so.)
550                         TOPICS IN SEMANTICS      (6-306) mangaddi dirib -ja      -ayoondi      yoowayi
              not       enter SUBJ IRR+BINDI he:was:afraid
              'He wouldn't go in; he was scared.' (He didn't entertain the notion
                 of going inside.)
Contrast the typical senses of the negative irrealis potential - see section
6.5.3.2 above.
      There is one example available where the interpersonal sense is denied: that
is the speaker denies that the proposition could be claimed, entertained, believed,
or whatever. It is:
      (6-307) mangaddi waj       ..p -awaddi          wamba -nyali goorijga

              'He can't have thrown it away (because) he's still got it'
(Note the English gloss involves the internal sense of because- see Halliday
and Hasan 1976:257.)
[3] Past subjunctive. The subjunctive occprs far less frequently in
independent clauses in real tenses, i.e. past and present, and it is impossible to
be sure of the meaning intended. However, the present framework provides for
reasonable interpretations of the examples available. With the real tenses non-
indicative carries the force of 'allegedly'. Both the interpersonal uses, in which
the speaker alleges or reckons that the situation occurred, and the experiential
uses, in which someone else (usually the actor) alleges, or is in a position to
allege that the situation occurred, occur. By 11 allege"" it is meant that the
 speaker/actor attests to the validity of the proposition in his/her opinion or
 estimation. This allows that s/he may be mistaken, and the situation did not
 occur.
      (a) Interpersonal. A typical example involving the interpersonal sense of
 the past subjunctive in an independent clause is (6-308). This comes from a text
 in which a police posse come across the recently vacated dinner-camp of a group
 of Aborigines they were following. The head tracker asserts (to the policemen):
       (6-308) ngab -ja       -widda      ngamoo -nyali
               eat    SUBJ (3pl)N+A before           REP
               'They were eating here not long ago.'
 By using the subjunctive here the speaker indicates that the proposition that they
 had eaten there recently was determined by circumstantial evidence~ and that s/he
 is not prepared to assert unreservedly to the proposition as a fact. Presumably
 there is, or may be, some uncertainty as to whether or not the situation occurred.
                              VERBAL CATEGORIES                                 551A more appropriate English translation might therefore be 'I reckon/I'm telling
you/it looks as though (etc.) they were eating here a short while ago'. (6-308) is
typical of the couple of examples available - the speaker has adequate evidence
to the truth of the proposition, but s/he is not relating (a set ot) events. Rather,
s/he is vouching for the validity of the proposition.
Compare the effect of this modalisation with the other possibilities:
propositional modification by yiganyi 'uncertain' of the past tense - yiganyi
ngabbidda ngamoo~nyali (uncertain they:ate before-REP) 'it is/1 am uncertain that
they were eating here a while ago'; and the irrealis subjunctive - ngabjayoodda
ngamoo-nyali (they:might:have:eaten before-REP) 'suppose (against the facts) that
they were eating here a little while ago'.
    (b) Experiential. The experiential use is exemplified in the following
example. (The relationship between the clauses here appears to by paratactic, not
hypotactic.)
      (6-309) boolga wardji -widdangi mooyoo bagi -ya             -widdi
              old:man he:went to:them sleep          lie  SUBJ (3pl)N+I
              'The old man went up to them thinking they were asleep.'
This sentence comes from a description of an old man who met up with two
young men who offered him food. They camped together, and during the night,
the old man sneaked up on them when he thought they were asleep, in order to
kill them. (He could not know they were asleep until he got up close to them;
they could be feigning sleep. Here the events are narrated from the perspective of
the old man.)
[4] Present subjunctive. I can only suggest that a similar explanation can
be invoked for the two available instances of independent use of the present
subjunctive. Consider:
      (6-310) yaadi ngarloodoo warang -ja           -~          ..dtJi
              we(U) three          sit        SUBJ PRES+(lU)N+I pa
              We're all sitting here (I tell you).'
(Contrast (6-320) below.) It may be that the speaker chooses the subjunctive in
cases such as this in order to avoid stating the obvious, by intruding his own
attitude. That is, I suggest as a possibility that utterances such as (6-310) have
closer translation equivalents in English biclausal constructions such as 'I
reckon/tell you that we're sitting here'.
      In a single example the present subjunctive was used with the sense that
the action was done hard, or energetically:
552                         TOPICS IN SEMANfiCS      (6-311) mud     -ja    -ngiri
              go       SUBJ PRES/(1 sg)N+I
              'I walk hard.'
This sense is usually expressed by means of the present tense together with the
adverbial mayaaddayadda 'hard'. It is likely that this sense arises by implication,
from the assertion 'I reckon I walk', 'I claim to walk.•, as it may for these
English glosses. Compare the use of the irrealis category in the habitual/generic
senses in Mangarayi (Roper River, Northern Territory)- see Merlan (1981:
196-198).","[513, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519, 520, 521, 522, 523, 524, 525, 526, 527, 528, 529, 530, 531, 532, 533]"
"      A clause may have more than one Theme. It seems that there will always
be at least one experiential role which is thematic in a clause. In addition, there
may be optionally a thematic conjunctive element or Propositional Modifier, or
                Tiffi TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OFTiffi CLAUSE                      379a Topic. There are certain ordering tendencies: textual Themes - i.e.
conjunctions - invariably precede other types of Theme; Topics precede other
types of Theme, except for textual ones; and experiential Themes tend to be the
fmal theme. However, Propositional Modifiers may occupy any position in the
thematic sequence, the placement being semantically significant (cf. section
5.4.1).
       It appears to be possible for a clause to have more than one independently
thematic experiential role. Line (61) of Text I is a convincing example. The
first tone unit, which consists of two nominal phrases, has the slight rise in
pitch associated with segmented Themes. The clause would appear to be ""about""
both the speaker and the kangaroo. It is possible that clauses such as the second
one in example (5-229) above also have two experiential Themes -an ellipsed
one, yoowarni gardiya 'one white person' (which is mentioned in the preceding
clause), and an explicit one, gamba 'water'. Multiple experiential Themes also
appear to occur quite frequently when one of them is a temporal or spatial
circumstance. These are normally starting point Themes, and the co-occurring
Theme is as a rule a participant role, which the clause is 'about'. Starting-point
Themes tend to be initial, like textual Themes - see for example line (7) of
Text 2.
       I have already discussed Theme in relation to information packaging. To
conclude this section I turn briefly to Theme in relation to given and new. As I
have already remarked, the Theme is most frequently chosen from the register of
what is given. However, this is not always the case, and Themes not
infrequently convey new information, especially if there is nothing given- cf.
Halliday (1967:212). Indeed, information Focus can fall on the Theme. Such a
Focus will of course be marked, and everything other than the Theme will be
given. That is, it will be presupposed that a situation occurred, or a relationship
of identity or attribution obtains with respect to the Theme. Examples include
the first clause of (5-234), and
     (5-240) jaji        -wami ngabbiddayi ginharruii -yiddi -ngga I
             something IND they:two:ate:it you:know DU ERG
             What is it that that pair have eaten?'
     (5-241) gardiya    gardlooni nganyi -ngga I
             white:man I:hit:him I            ERG
             1t was the white man that I hit'
(5-240) presupposes that they ate something; (5-241) that the speaker hit
someone. Sentences such as these are naturally translated into English as it-
380                               THE CLAUSEclefts. The difference is that the Theme in the English it-cleft is an unmarked
focus, whereas it is marked in the Gooniyandi versions.
      A focal Theme may be singled out and made more prominent by use of a
deictic expression such as ngirndajiya (this-LOC) 'here'. For example:
      (S-242) ngirndaji -ya   ngirndaji -wami ngabgoodda I
              this      LOC this          IND they:eat:it
              'Here, maybe this is what they eat'
This example is a direct quote which comes from a narrative. The speaker was
one of a pair of young men looking around the campsite of another group of
people for the food they had been gathering. The effect of the initial deictic is to
single out the referent, drawing it to the addressee's attention.
      But Gooniyandi does have a means of making a Theme into the unmarked
Focus. This is effected by employing a pair of phrases to refer to the Thematic
item. One expression occurs initially, as Theme; the other, the information
Focus, occurs finally also in its unmarked position. For example, yoowooloo
'man' and boolgawoolga 'old men' in line (1) of Text 2 both refer to the same
entity. The first phrase is the Theme, the second is the unmarked Focus.
Another example is
      (S-243) wanyjiddi ngoddagi -ngga yoowooloo gardbini
              river:roo my         ERG man              he:hit:it
              jamadda I
               male:kangaroo
              'A river kangaroo my son killed, a male one.'
      A special case of this construction occurs when the discontinuous pieces
constitute together a single phrase experientially -see, for example, (4-16)
above and line (61) of Text 1. In general, the two parts of any discontinuous
phrase occur initially and finally, as Theme and unmarked Focus. It seems that
the main function of discontinuity in Gooniyandi is to enable a single
experiential role to fulfil more than one textual role. This construction is also
functionally different from the English it-cleft, which likewise has the effect of
making the Theme the unmarked Focus. This is because the material between
the Theme and the Focus in the Gooniyandi construction is unmarked for the
values given/new (see page 371 above). But the Theme must be new (since it is
at the same time focal), and it follows that everything following the Theme
                 THE TEXTUAL ORGANISATION OF THE ClAUSE                           381must also be new. 6 This means that the clause involves no presupposition. This
is the case in the examples cited. By contrast, it-clefts in English involve
presuppositions. For further discussion of this pattern, see McGregor (1989).
       Instead of occurring at different ends of a clause, a pair of phrases referring
to the same thematic item may be juxtaposed, to form a type of complex
Theme. Presumably the juxtaposed phrases may be logically related in any one
of the ways mentioned in section 4.3.1. Of particular interest is the case in
which the relationship is one of identification, whereby one phrase, usually the
first, identifies the second (cf. also section 5.2.1.1.1 above). The identifying
phrase is typically the information Focus of the clause, and following material
is of course given. That is, it is given (and presupposed) that the situation
obtained for a certain entity (time, place, or whatever), and that that entity (or
whatever) is identified by a different designation. Reference to the entity in the
given part of the communication is frequently by means of a determiner. In this
case, the construction is roughly equivalent to the English 'x is the one that
did/is y'; and the determiner in the Gooniyandi version does roughly the job of
the indefinite 'one' in the English version. Examples are line (12) of Text 2, and
     (5-244) ngooddoo -ngga niyaji -ngga doownga
             that         ERG this    ERG he:took:it
             'That is the one who took it'
The following is a possible example of the opposite order, the Identifier
following the Identified:
      (5-245) niyi -ngga gardbini       ngirndaji -ngga I ngooddoo
               that ERG he:hit:him this             ERG      that
               yaanya gijali I
               other dead
               The one who killed the other dead person is this one.'
Note that here the two coreferential phrases are not juxtaposed; in contrast to the
pattern discussed above for discontinuity in the preceding paragraph, the Theme
here is given.
      Reference to the entity within the given part of the clause need not always
be by means of a determiner, as line (1) of Text 1 illustrates. Here the determiner
is the Identifier, and is focal. In this case, the closest English equivalent is a
clause such as 'This is the x that did/is y'.","[362, 363, 364, 365]"
"5.6.1.1 Projection of speech
Speech is normally reported in the form of a 'direct quote', which provides a
possible wording for the spoken utterance. That is, it represents an utterance
concerning the world as it might have been, or might be spoken; it does not
directly refer to a situation or relation of the world. The deictic categories of
tense, person, spatial deixis, etc. are all shifted to the reference point of the
speech situation referred to. Quoted speech clauses are usually projected by
clauses referring to the situation in which the speech was uttered. They may,
however, occur independently. A text count showed that about a third of quoted
speech clauses occur in isolation, the remaining two-thirds being projected. (See
the texts of Appendix 1; examples of independent quotations occur in lines (33)
and (52) of Text 1, line (12) of Text 2, and lines (8) and (12) of Text 3.) When
a clause is not projected by a clause of speech, the fact that it is a representation
of what was said (rather than of what happened, or will happen) may be signalled
by a change in voice quality.
      Both orders, projecting preceding projected, and projected preceding
projecting, occur. The former predominates in elicited responses to prompts of
the type ""x told y to' ...""'; however, a textual count showed approximately the
same frequency of each order. Examples are, respectively, (5-337), and line (38)
of Text 1.
      (5-337) migami -ngadda       ngaraggi/a dillybag gardiya
              she:told to:me       I:make:it              white:people
               ngangjawili
               I:will:give:him
               'She told me ""I make dillybags to sell to white people"".'
Sometimes the quoted clause is discontinuous, flanking the projecting clause on
both sides- see for example line (51) of Text 1, and (5-342) below.
     The relationship between the projected and the projecting clause appears to
be paratactic: there is no convincing evidence that the projected quotation is
subordinate to the clause of communication. (There is certainly no evidence that
414                                 THE CLAUSEthe directly quoted clause is embedded: in particular, the quotation clearly does
not fulfil a similar role to thangarndi 'word' in thangarndi jijagji (word he:said)
'he spoke words'.)
      There are two main types of clause that project direct quotations.
      (a) Projecting clauses are predominantly clauses of speech or verbal
communication. The main lexical verbs referring to such processes are:
      miga-           'say, tell, do'
      jag-            'say, tell'
      jijag-          'say, speak'
      yan.gin-        'request, ask'
      goowaj-         'call by name, tell'
      baa-            'shout out'
      jangi-          'answer, reply'
      rooddij-        'argue, swear'
      gamalg-         'speak, say, tell' (avoidance style lexeme)
This classification of speech act types is quite different from the classification I
have proposed in section 5.4.1. It does not distinguish assertions from
proposals, both of which (in all their subtypes) occur in quotes with each of the
verbs listed, except perhaps for rooddij- 'argue, swear', which normally occurs
only in reference to exclamations and proposals. Yan.gin- 'ask, request', for
example, indicates either a request for information (a question), as in (5-338), or
a request for action, as in (5-339):
      (5-338) David -joo yan.ginli   yoowooloo garndiwangooddoo
                     DAT I:asked:him man       many
                 thiddi gardbiwiddarni        danymilimayoona
                 fight they:fought:together you:heard:them?
                 1 asked David ""Did you hear them fighting?"".'
      (5-339) yan.ginngindi maa winhi ngangbindi
              he:asked:me    meat maybe you:will:give:me
              'He requested of me ""Will you give me some meat?"".'
It might be expected that clauses referring to bodily processes such as nyimij-
'wink', nyamnyam- 'whisper', could project direct quotes. However, the only
potential example available is
      (5-340) midda -ngga nginnginmi marlami
              head   ERG he:shook:it nothing
              'He shook with his head ""Nothing"".'","[397, 398]"
"3.9.3.7 Number enclitics
A single number marking enclitic, specifying either 'dual' (indicating two), or
'paucal' (indicating a few), can optionally occur in final position of any VP in
which at least one bound pronominal (either a prefix to the CC or an oblique
enclitic) is of non-singular number. This pronominal can modify ANY ONE of
the up to three non-singular pronominals that may occur in a finite VP. In case
there is more than one such non-singular category, the question immediately
226                                1HEWORDarises as to which one the number enclitic applies to. I am unable to provide a ·
categorical answer to this question. Moreover, I doubt seriously whether there is
one: it seems likely that an answer will only be possible if discourse factors are
taken into account.
      The general statement made in the previous paragraph requires some
qualification. Non-singular categories of the second and third person may be
modified by either the dual or the paucal enclitic. But in the first person non-
singular things are a little more complicated. As might be expected, the dual
will not (normally) apply to the unrestricted category (and there are no such
examples), to which only the paucal can apply. Both the dual and the paucal
may modify the first person restricted category, but the dual is used only in
reference to a pair one of which is the speaker, and the other is a third person
(and never the hearer). If the restricted category refers to the speaker and hearer
pair, it cannot be modified by the dual enclitic. That is, a form such as
milayiddayi (see-(lR)N+A-du) can only mean 'we two (exclusive of the hearer)
saw him'; it cannot mean 'we two (including the hearer) saw him'. (As
mentioned in the previous section, the irregular form -ngangi 'we two inclusive'
could be used in place of -yi, and refer to the speaker and hearer pair; but this
only when they fill the roles of Goal or Affected. -Ngangi may not be used in a
VP with a meaning such as 'we two inclusive saw him'.)
      The number enclitics have the following allomorphs:
                              -yi ~ -yoo     'dual' (du)
                    -ddi- -ddoo - -waddi     'paucal' (pa)
      The first allomorph in each case seems to be the most frequent variant,
occurring following /i/ or /a/, while the second allomorph usually follows /oo/.
Some examples are: ward-biddi-yi (go-(3pl)N+I-du) 'they went', ward-gooddoo-
yoo (go-PRES+(3pi)N+A-du) 'they (two) go', ngab-jidda-yi (eat-(lR)N+A-du)
'we two (exclusive) ate', mila-winbidda-ddi (see-FUT+(lsg)N+(3pl)A+A-pa)
'they (few) will see me'. miga-limi-widdangi-yi (say-(lsg)N+MI-(3pl)O-du) 'I
told them two', miga-winmi-ngaddagi-yi (say-(3pl)N+MI-(Isg)O-du) 'they two
told me'.
      The third allomorph of the paucal number enclitic, -waddi, occurs in
exactly the same circumstances as does the allomorph -wanhi of the third person
singular oblique bound pronominal, namely in the environment of non-past
tense forms of the classifiers +I, +DI and +MI- i.e. following {a 1 ). Examples:
      {ward   -wi   +bidd         +a 1 -waddi)     'they few go'
       go      PRES (3pl)N        +I    pa

3.9.3.8 Summary: an interpretation of the finite verb phrase
The structure of the VP may be summarised in the following terms. The VP
consists of two obligatory grammatical words, which are mutually bound to, and
modify, one another, and which occur in a fixed order. This order reflects a
progression from specific to general, in terms of the lexical content, and at the
same time, somewhat paradoxically, a progression from the item that is least
specific and individuating in terms of pinning down the process to the referent
world, to the most specific and individuating, the item which refers to the actual
occurrence of the process. The position of enclitics in the VP is now explicable.
Aspect and Mood are ways of viewing the Process or predicate itself, as a whole;
they are not concerned with the actual fact of the occurrence of the Process. For
example, the progressive is concerned with the occurrence of a train of events
leading up to the culmination of the process, rather than to a process emerging
into instantiation; repetition (realised by -nyali REP) refers to repetition of a
Process, with or without the same participants, not to the repetition of an
instantiation of a process. On the other hand, the categories labelled Mode
concern the occurrence and actualisation of a process; it is the enactment of the
process that is seen as desirable, definite, or potential. Enclitics attach to the g-
words on which their primary focus falls: the lexical stem in the case of
Aspectual and Mood markers, and the CC in case of Mode, pronominal and
number markers.","[210, 211, 212]"
"2.5.3 Polymorphemic words
It is convenient to divide the account of stress in polymorphemic words into two
parts, one dealing with words involving one or more suffixes, enclitics, or
postpositions; the other concerned wilh the classifier complex (CC) in the finite
verb.
[1] Suffixes, enclitics and postpositions
These morphemes consist of between one and four syllables. Most
monosyllables are unstressed, whilst most polysyllables arc stressed initially.
Some examples are:
Monosyllables:
      'nganyi-ngga      'I-ERG'
      'niyi-ya          'that-LOC
      'marla'mi-ya      'nothing-LOC'
                                     STRESS                                   125
Bisyllables:
     'ngaddagi-'nhingi       'my-ABL'
     'ngooddoo-'nhingi       'that-ABL'
     'birla-'binyi           'yams-PER'
     'jinali-'ngaddi-ngga    'spear-COMIT-ERG
Polysyllables:
     'bij,ngarni-'ngiddangi 'he came up to us'
     'boolga-'wadda,wadda 'everyone associated with Bulka swamp'
As these examples show, the stressed syllable in a bound morpheme is
frequently as heavily stressed as- indeed, it may be more heavily stressed than
-the stressed syllable of the root to which it is attached.
(a) Monosyllabic non-root morphemes. It appears that there is only one
stressed monosyllabic non-root morpheme, -nhi, the third person singular
oblique pronominal enclitic; -nhi constitutes a phonological word. The
remaining unstressed monosyllables are all 'cohering': that is, when added to a
root, stress is assigned first to the root as an independent word, and then to the
root plus morpheme as a single unit. In case this gives rise to a sequence of
stressed syllables, the second syllable in the sequence loses its stress (cf. S2).
When added to a monosyllable or bisyllable, these monosyllabic morphemes
have no effect on the stress pattern- e.g. 'maa-yoo 'meat-DAT'; and 'nganyi-
ngga 'I-ERG'. When added to a root of three syllables (having the unmarked
SUU pattern), stress falls on the final syllable of the root: 'ngadda'gi-ngga 'my-
ERG'. (When the trisyllabic root has the SUS pattern, of course, the morpheme
has no effect on it- e.g. 'gooroo'ngal-ya 'Christmas:Creek-LOC'.) When added
to a word of four syllables the stress pattern of the root is unchanged. For
example, 'warli'biddi-ya 'river-LOC'. This word has, of course, a stress pattern
distinct from that of monomorphemic words of five syllables.
      The same thing happens recursively when two (or more) monosyllabic
morphemes are added to a word. For example, 'ngaboo-'wa-ngga (father-his-ERG)
'by his father', 'ngadda'nyoo-wa-ngga (mother-his-ERG) 'by his mother', and
'nganyi-'ngga-rni (I-ERG-SEQ) 'by me next'.
(b) Bisyllabic and polysyllabic morphemes. All but a couple of
bisyllabic and polysyllabic morphemes bear initial stress, and constitute separate
phonological words from the words to which they are attached.
In most of the examples given so far, the initial stress in suffixed bi- and poly-
syllabic morphemes may be accounted for under either the assumption that that
126                      PHONETICSANDPHONOUDGY
morpheme constitutes a distinct phonological word, and as a consequence is
stressed initially, or that the full free word is stressed as a single phonological
word. There is, however, evidence that the second assumption is untenable.
Sequences of stressed syllables inadmissible within single phonological words
arise when the bisyllabic postpositions are suffixed to monosyllabic verbal and
nominal roots. For example, 'ward'nhingi (go-ABL) 'from walking', 'maa'nhingi
(meat-ABL) 'from meat', etc.
      There are just a few bisyllabic morphemes for which it is useful to assume
that they are not stressed; all have initial {w} which is realised as per VR6. They
include -wanya 'other', -wadda 'manner' (on which see section 5.5.1.3), -wila-
FACT(ive mood), -wanhi, which is an allomorph of the third person singular
oblique pronominal enclitic, etc .. These morphemes appear to be 'cohering' as
per the definition above. For example,
      {goornboo -wanya}       ~      {goombaanya/         'other women'
       woman     other
      {yoowooloo -wanya}       ~     (yoowoo'laanya/        'other men'
       man        other
      {narta -Wld:la}      ~      /nardaadda/     'crying along'
       cry    MNR
[21 The classifier complex
The classifier complex usually consists of a single phonological word, distinct
from the preceding one, which includes the verbal root or stem, and/or a verbal
enclitic. In the majority of cases, these two entities (the verb stem and the
classifier complex) are stressed independently, the root and enclitic as per 2.5.1
and 2.5.2 above. Exceptions occur only when the present tense prefix -wi+
follows a vowel.
      The CC is usually stressed as a single phonological word, the first syllable
receiving stress. For example:
      {ward -bi  +a}      ~        {ward'ba/, (ward,ba/       'you'll take it'
       go    FUT +A
      {ward -wi  +li     +a}           ~    fward'gila/, fward.gila/      'I take it'
       go    FUT +(lsg)N +A
      (mila -bi +jadd +a}               ~   /mila'wadda/       'we'll see him'
       see FUT +(lU)N +A
      {mila -bi  +ngim +bidd     +a}                'they'll see you'
       see   FUT +(2sg)A +(3pl)N +A
                                       STRESS                                         127           ~    /mila'wimbidda/
      {goowaj -wi       +bilagini}               'he calls himself
       call:name PRES +(3sg)N/ARNI2
             ~ fgoowaj'goola'gini/     {mila -jidd  +iny      +bidd +a}               'we'll see you'
      see   (lR)N +(2sg)A +(3pl) +A
          ~ /mila'yiddiny'bidda/     As these examples show, initial stress in the CC comes from two sources.
(i) It may come from the inherent stress of a pronominal prefix (as in the third
and final examples immediately above). The assumption that some pronominal
prefixes bear inherent stress while others do not is made in order to explain the
fact that the initial {w} of the present tense is not lost in forms such as
milawadda 'we all see him' (see derivation on page 110 above), whereas it is lost
in forms such as milaanbidda (deriving from {mila-wi+ngin+bidd+a} (see-
PRES+(lsg)A+(3pl)N+A) 'they see me'. There is, in fact, independent evidence
which lends support to this assumption. This comes from the second person
plural nominative and accusative pronominals nggidd- and nggin- which, unlike
the other stressed pronominals, never coalesce with the preceding syllable. They
are stressed whether or not they are initial in the CC. For example,
      {watd -wi   +nggidd        +i}    ~    fwardgi'nggiddi/         'you (pi) go'
       go    PRES +(2pl)N        +I
     {mila -bi +nggidd +a}             ~   /milawi'nggidda/     'you (pl) will see it'
      see FUT +(2pl)N +A
It turns out that a single CC contains at most one inherently stressed
pronominal prefix - this fact is accounted for by the allomorph choice (see
section 3.9.3.2.2 below). This stressed prefix always precedes other pronominal
prefixes, and must occur either initially in the CC, or following a tense prefix.
It follows that the inherently stressed syllable is either the first or, rarely, the
second syllable of the CC. It would seem that stress is subsequently assigned to
following syllables in the CC as per the rules of pages 122-123 above,
assuming that the initial stress identifies the boundary of the phonological word.
(ii) Otherwise, if no syllable bears inherent stress, it must be assumed that stress
is assigned later, after the sandhi rules have applied and the CC has taken on its
final phonological shape. In this case, it appears that the CC is stressed as per
the rules just referred to. If it is monosyllabic, the CC usually receives weak
128                      PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGYstress only, especially when it follows a stressed syllable. For example, wardji
'he went' usually has main stress on the initial syllable, with secondary or
tertiary stress on the second syllable. Occasionally, however, the main stress is
heard to fall on the second syllable.
Sequences of up to three consecutive stressed syllables have been heard:
'ward'ba'ngadda (go-FUT+A-(lsg)O) 'you'll bring it to me' and 'dij'nya'laa (snap-
REP-PRES+A) 'he snaps it again'. However, it is usual in examples such as this
for the stress on the second syllable to be reduced to a secondary or even tertiary
one.
     It has been mentioned already that stress does not cross the boundary
between the stem and the CC, when sequences such as i-yi occur (see page 64
above). However, when the {w} of the present tense prefix -wi+ is lost
following a vowel (but not when it is lost following a [+continuant]), the initial
vowel of the CC and the final vowel of the verbal stem coalesce. In this case, it
appears that the CC forms a single phonological word with the immediately
preceding unit. For example,
      {mila -wi +a}        -7   fmilaa/, or, rarely, /mi'laa/         'he sees him'
       see PRES +A
      {mila   -wi   +li      +a}        -7   fmi'laala/      'I see him'
       see     PRES +(1 sg)N +A
      {mila -wi   +jan   +a}           -7    fmi'laana/         'he sees us'
       see   PRES +(lU)A +A

       see   PRES +(lsg)A +(3pl)N +A
(Note: Under the assumption that the second a and the final n of the second
syllable in milaanbidda 'they see me' each contribute one mora (cf. page 122
above), this word has six morae. Stress should fall on the first and fourth morae
by the rule of page 122 above; by the rule preventing successive stressed
syllables, stress goes onto the second syllable, which includes the fourth mora.)

3.1.1 Grammatical outline
The primary notion which will be invoked in this book to explain the
grammatical patterns in Gooniyandi is that of constituency. It will be assumed
that constituents are linguistic signs; that is, they are characterised by both their
form and their meaning. Consequently their identification is dependent not just
on formal criteria, but also on concurrent identification of their meaning, where,
by the 'meaning' of a constituent I refer to its function in the whole of which it
is a part (cf. Haas 1954:80). For example, ngooddoo 'that' is a constituent of
ngooddoo yoowooloo 'that man', and functions as the Deictic within the full
phrase (see 4.1.2.1 below). This function must be distinguished from the lexical
meaning of the word ngooddoo 'that'. This approach to constituency division
contrasts sharply with immediate constituent analysis, in which cuts are
generally assumed to be binary, and in which constituents need not fulfil
functions in the whole of which they constitute a part (cf. Halliday 1985:22ff).
It is a type of 'string constituent analysis' (Longacre 1960), in which the
constituents are labeled by their function. In this section I will represent
constituency in terms of trees, usually with unlabeled nodes. Later on, when the
functional labels become important, I will also use Chinese box diagrams.
      A general account of the shape of constituency trees in Gooniyandi is
possible if a constituency hierarchy or 'rank scale' (Halliday 1961/1976:58) is
recognised. The proposed rank scale for this language is shown in Figure 3-1.
      The immediate constituents of a 'unit' (Halliday 1961/1976) of a given
rank are typically units of the rank immediately below on the scale. A unit of
one of the three highest ranks may be described as a syntagm of units of
immediately lower rank. Clauses consist of phrases, and may be described as
constructions of phrase-level units; phrases consist of words, and may be

"3.9.3.2.1 The classifier
Gooniyandi has twelve classifiers, most of which have a unique underlying
morphophonemic shape. They are listed in Table 3-7, together with some basic
combinatorial and semantic information.
                      Table 3-7: The Gooniyandi classifiers            Form         Valence      Semantic characteristics
     (1)    +A           1, 2         Extendible; 'extend'
     (2)    +ADDI        2            Accomplishment; 'put'
     (3)    +DI          1, 2         Accomplishment; 'catch'
     (4)    +MI          1, 2         Accomplishment; 'effect'
     (5)    +BINI        1, 2         Accomplishment; 'hit'
     (6)    +I           1            Extendible; 'go, be'
     (7)    +BINDI       1            Accomplishment; 'get, become'
     (8)    +ANI         1            Accomplishment; 'fall'
     (9)    +ARNlt       1, 2         Accomplishment; 'emerge'
     (10)   +BIRLI       1, 2         Accomplishment; 'consume'
     (11)   +ARNlz       1            Extendible; Reflexive/Reciprocal
     (12)   +MARNI        1           Accomplishment; Reflexive/Reciprocal     For each of the eight classifiers +A, +ADD!, +BIND!, +ANI, +ARNit.
+BIRLI, +ARNI 2 and +MARNI there is no non-phonologically conditioned
allomorphy. Their ultimate phonemic shapes are, however, affected by the
following sandhi rules:
196                                 THE WORD(1) Rule CCR9: i+boo ~ oo. This affects +BINDI and +BIRLI, in case they are
prefixed by a tense or pronominal prefix. Examples are:
      {barn -ji      +hindi}       ~ jbamjoondi/       'you returned'
       return (2sg)N +BINDI
      {ngab   -li        +birli} ~ /ngabloorli/        'I ate it up'
       eat     (lsg)N    +BIRLI
(2) Rule R8: i ~ oo 1          - woo. This rule affects all final i's, when followed
by -woo DEF. Example,
      {bij    -wi       +ami       -woo} ~ {bij-warnoowoo}             'he comes'
       emerge            FUT       +ARNI1 DEF
                                        ~ /bijgamoowoo/(The· gloss given here is very approximate, and does not carry any of the flavom
of the Gooniyandi word. This is because it is impossible to give the word a
suitable English gloss out of context- see section 6.5.3.3.)(3) Rule VR2: b   ~ w 1 # X {[[v=~~antal]} - _ _ Z #, which again affects
                                  +contmuant
+BINDI and +BIRLI. Example:
      {nyamani -0      +hindi}         ~ /nyamaniwindi/        'he grew big'
       big      (3sg)N +BINDI
     Three of the remaining classifiers, namely +DI, +MI and +I, each have two
allomorphs:
                               +DI :     (ti- tad
                               +MI:      {mi-mad
                               +1:       {i-at}
      In each instance the choice of allomorph depends on tense: the first variant
occurs in past and irrealis tenses; the second in the present and future.
      With two exceptions the first allomorph of each classifier is invariant in
ultimate phonological realisation. Both exceptions involve {di}. Firstly, by rule
CCR2 {d} assimilates in place of articulation to a preceding palatal, as in
ngangnginyji '1 gave you it' (see derivation on page 102 above). Secondly, with
the person/number combinations (lsg)-t(3sg) (i.e. first person singular acting
on third person singular), (2sg)-t(3sg), (3sg)~(2sg), and (3sg)-t(3sg), the
classifier appears to have no phonological realisation in any tense. For example,
                               THE VERB PHRASE                                 197instead of the expected nganglidi 'I gave him it' (from ngang- 'give', -li+ (lsg)N,
and +di 'catch'), ngangli occurs; and instead of ngangbinggidi 'he'll give you it'
(ngang- 'give', -bi+ FUT, +nggi+ (2sg)A, +di 'catch'), ngangbinggi occurs. One
way of accounting for these forms is by a rule deleting d unless it is preceded by
a consonant. This is the motivation for rule CCRS. Evidence in support of this
proposal (over the alternative that in these particular person/number
combinations the classifier has a zero allomorph) comes from the progressive
present of verbs such as ngang- 'give' (which habitually collocate with +Dl
'catch'). The forms found have the vowel a, the expected shape given that +Dl
'catch' has the allomorph {-da 1 } in the non-past. The (lsg)~(3sg) form would
derive as follows:
      {ngang -goowa -wi        +li     +da 1 }           'I'm giving him it'
       give   PROG    PRES      (lsg)N +DI
          ~ {nganggoowa-wi+li+ad (by d-deletion)
          ~ {nganggoowa-wila1 ) (VR9)
          ~ /nganggoowaala/ (VR6 and CCR13)This indicates the presence of the classifier in underlying form, and so I adopt
this solution: otherwise the final a is inexplicable.
A disadvantage of this solution is that it requires us to posit -bidd+ as an
allomorph of the third person plural accusative pronominal prefix, in morpheme
configurations where -ri+ and -bi+ (but not -bidd+) are attested for other
classifiers.
      The phonological realisations of the second allomorphs are determined by
rule CCR 13, and of course by the two rules just discussed.
      {ad is realised by /a/ when followed by /w/. This occurs in three
circumstances: firstly, when the DEF enclitic -woo follows the CC, as
exemplified in
      {ward -wi    +ji      +a1 -woo}     'you're going'
       go    PRES (2sg)N +I       DEF
          ~ /wardginyjawoo/ (by CCR8, VR6, and CCR14);secondly, when followed by the -waddi allomorph of the paucal number marker
(see below 3.9.3.7), as in
      {ngang -bi     +jin      +da1 -waddi}        'he'll give it to us'
       give    FUT (IR)A +DI         pa
           ~ {ngangbinda-waddi} (CCRIO)
           ~ /ngangbindaaddi/;
198                                mE WORDand thirdly, when followed by the -wanhi allomorph of the third person singular
oblique pronominal enclitic:
      {jijag -wi      +jidd   +a 1 -wanhi}   'we talk to him'
       speak PRES (lR)N +I          (3sg)O
           -7/jijaggiddaanhV (by CCRlO, VR6 and CCR13).
     Otherwise {a 1 } harmonises with the vowel in the preceding syllable of the
CC, if there is one. Examples:
      {ngang -bi     +jadd    +da1 } 'we'll give him it'
       give     FUT (lU)N +DI
           -7 {ngangbadd+dad (by CCRI2)
           -7 /ngangbada/ (by CCR6)      {jangi -ja      -bi +jidd    +iny  +bidd    +bi       +ma1 )
       ask     SUBJ FUT (IR)N (2sg)A (3pl)N (3pl)A +MI
           -7/jangiyawiddinybirimV (by CCRIO, CCR7, VR2, VR3, and
                                    CCRI3)   'we might ask you (pl)'
      {ward   -wi +bidd         +a 1 ) 'they're going'
       go      FliT (3pl)N      +I
          -7 { ward-woodda 1 } (by CCR9)
          -7/wardgooddoo/ (by VR6 and CCR13)
    Finally, if {ad is in the initial syllable of the CC it is realised by /a/. For
example:
      {ngang   -bi   +da1 }   'give him it'
       give     FUT +DI
           -7 {ngang-bad (by CCR5, and CCR14)
           -7/ngangba/
The second series of allomorphs, {tat}, {mat}, and {ad, account for the shape of
the classifiers in nearly all person/number combinations in the present and future
tenses. The only exceptions are in the (3sg)~(3sg) form of the future of +DI and
+I, where the shape of the CC in each case is /bi/, instead of the predicted /ba/,
from underlying {bi+(d)a1), which becomes {ba1 ), ultimately /ba/. The same thing
happens in the same person/number combination in the present tense of +MI,
where the form is an invariant /mi/. The only way I can account for these forms is
to assume that, exceptionally, they instantiate the first allomorph of the
respective classifiers.
      The remaining classifier, +BINI, presents a more complicated and less
                               THE VERB PHRASE                               199regular pattern. There are three main allomorphs, {bini}, {boo} and {oo}, the
choice among which is morphologically conditioned. {bini} occurs in the past5
and irrealis tenses, and in progressive and subjunctive futures; {boo} and {oo}
occur almost everywhere in the plain future, present, and present defmite tenses.
Since the latter are strongly orientated to the speech situation, and are the
categories used most frequently in proposals (Halliday 1985 :86), it may be worth
speculating that the {boo} allomorph derives from an earlier imperative form of
the classifier which has now generalised to cover the corresponding indicative
categories. (See also footnote at bottom to this page.) This is almost certainly
how the zero second person singular pronominals in (2sg)~(3sg) futures of other
classifiers arose: that is, by generalisation of an imperative.
     {bini} can be affected drastically by the following rules:(1) VR2: b -t w I# X    {[[v::u~~antal]}- __ Z #.This rule applies only in
                           +contmuant
case (bini} is the sole constituent of the CC; this occurs only in the past tense
for (3sg)-t(3sg), following a root final vowel or continuant:
     {bilgoodd -~        -bini}      'he cracked him on the skull'
      crack       (3sg)N +BINI
          -t /bilgooddwini/
(2) CCR7: ddb -t r. This rule applies where {bini} follows the dd of
nominative plural pronominal prefixes (see next section). For example:
     (nyag -jidd   +bini} -t /nyagjirinil         'we speared it'
      pierce (IR)N +BINI
                           vocalic ] _ _. This rule applies when {bini}
(3) Rule CCR4: n -t rn I [ +retroflex
follows the +ri+ allomorph of the third person plural nominative, and when this
morpheme follows a [-continuant] consonant. Example:
     {gard -ngin     +ri      +bini)  'they hit me'
      hit    (lsg)A (3pl)N +BINI
          -t {gard-ngin+rooni} (by CCR9)5 As Alan Rumsey has pointed out to me, in Ungarinyin -ni occurs with the
cognate root boo - woo 'hit' as a past indicative marker (see Rumsey 1982b:81).
In Gooniyandi, however, ni cannot be segmented from bi and identified as a tense
or mood marker, as the other contexts of occurrence of -bini indicate.

                           +retroflex
              ~ /gardngoondoorni/ (by CCR4 and CCR16)(4) Rule CCR9: i + bi ~ oo. Only the singular pronominals have final vowels,
so this rule applies only in the case of two singular actants (and then with the
exception of the cases in which (lsg) is Goal, since the (lsg)A pronominal has a
final consonant). Examples:
      {gard     -li         +bini) ~ /gardlooni/       'I hit him'
      hit        (lsg)N     +BINI
      {gml -nggi          +bini)   ~ /gardginggooni/      'he hit you'
       hit  (2sg)A        +BINI
      Construction of the CC with the {boo} and {oo} allomorphs is somewhat
irregular in terms of the construction of the pronominal configuration, which
also varies according to whether it occurs with the present or future tense prefix.
The (oo} allomorph usually occurs following the dd of nominative plurals (cf.
CCR7) and (boo) elsewhere. For example,
      {gard -wi      +ng      +iny    +boo -woo}                     'I hit you'
       hit   PRES     (lsg)N   (2sg)A +BINI DEF
           ~ /gardginyboowoo/      (gard     -bi  +jidd +oo} ~ /gardbiddoo/                'we'll hit him'
       hit       FUT (lR)N +BINI
      There are, however, irregularities in the distribution of the allomorphs.
{boo} is restricted to the three categories mentioned above, but in just a few
instances {bini} replaces the expected {boo}. These appear to be irregularities,
and I do not attempt to explain them. Instead, the occurring forms are tabulated
below, in section 3.9.3.2.3. In some cases {bini} and {boo} both seem to occur,
apparently in free variation. For example,
      {gard -bi     +nggidd +ri              +boo}         'you (pl) will hit them'
       hit   FUT      (2pl)N    (3pl)A       +BINI
           ~ {gard-binggiddroo}
           ~ /gardbinggooddroo/and
      (gard -bi  +nggidd +bi   +bini)                'you (pl) will hit them'
       hit   FUT (2pl)N (3pl)A +BINI
                               THE VERB PHRASE                                  20I           ~ {gard-binggidd+booni}
           ~ /gardbinggoorooni/appear to be mutually replaceable. I do not know whether these are dialectal
variants, but there is no evidence at all that they differ in representational
(experiential) meaning.
       Only one of the rules mentioned above, namely (4), CCR9, also applies to
{boo}, and it does so in similar grammatical environments. (2) (i.e. CCR7) is
prevented from applying by the choice of the oo allomorph following dd; (3)
(i.e. CCR4) can apply only to {bini}; and (1) (VR2) cannot apply since there is
always at least an intervening tense morpheme between {boo} and the verb root.
The following example illustrates the operation of rule CCR9 in conditions as
specified for (4) above:
      {gan:l  -w1    +nggi    +boo         -woo}      'he's hitting you'
       hit     PRES (2sg)A +BINI            DEF
           ~ /gardginggoowoo/      The function of the classifiers is to indicate the type of process that is
referred to. They cJassify the lexical words (which realise the VP role Process in
Fl) with which they occur, thereby modifying their significance. Classifiers do
not divide the set of verballexemes into disjoint subsets. Most verbal lexemes
collocate with more than one classifier, and the choice between these classifiers
distinguishes among various process types that may be referred to by the same
lexical item. The processes differ in terms of the meaning features set out in the
second and third columns of Table 3-7 (see also section 6.5.5).
      The classifiers numbered (I) to (5), (9) and (IO) may occur with
pronominal prefix configurations referring to two actants in the referent
situation. However, all of them except (apparently) for +ADDI may occur with a
single pronominal prefix, which makes reference to a single actant. On the other
hand, those classifiers numbered (6) to (8), (II) and (12) may occur with only
one pronominal prefix. I will refer to them as monovalent rather than
intransitive, since they can occur in some clauses of 'directed action' (see section
5.2.I.3).
      At the least 'delicate' level, classifiers may be divided into two groups: (a)
those which classify the process as an ACCOMPUSHMENT; and (b) those which
classify it as EXTENDIBLE. +I is the only exception: it usually indicates
extendibles, but in certain well defined circumstances it can refer to
accomplishments, as will be mentioned below. As I use the term here,
'accomplishment' refers to any process for which there is an inherent point at
 202                                 1HEWORD  which it is actualised, before which it has not yet occurred, and after which it has
  occurred, and is completed. Examples are processes such as 'hit', 'arrive'. 'die',
 etc •. Accomplishments often have 'trains' of circumstances leading up to their
 point of actualisation, such as for example the nearing of the destination in the
 process 'arrive'. But, until the point of actualisation is reached, the process
 cannot truthfully be said to have occurred. After the point has been reached, the
 process in usually completed, and may then be truthfully described in a clause in
  the past tense. By 'extendible' I mean processes without such points of
 completion: once started, they can (at least in principle) continue on indefinitely.
 Examples include processes such as 'walk'. 'sit', 'see', 'carry', etc .. There is no
 inherent point of accomplishment for processes like these.
        Other meanings, very roughly glossed in the final column of Table 3-7 can
 be attributed to the individual classifiers. These will be discussed in more detail
 in section 6.5.5. A few further remarks may be in order here, for the reader's
 orientation.
        Many more subdivisions are made within accomplishments than
 extendibles, of which there are only three subtypes, which very broadly
 correspond to the trichotomy transitive (+A), intransitive (+I) and
 reflexive/reciprocal (+ARNI:z). However, the importance of the major division
 accomplishment/extendible can be seen from the fact that all distinctions other
 than this one are neutralised in the reflexive/reciprocal.
        It is tempting to analyse· the -rni in +ARNI2 and +MARNI as a
reflexive/reciprocal suffix to the two classifiers +A and +MI. However, +ARNI2
 chooses different allomorphs of the first person singular to +A, and has an
 irregular third person singular. And +MARNI cannot be regarded as consisting of
 the (mad allomorph of +MI, since (i) the first vowel of +MARNI does not
 harmonise with the vowel of the preceding syllable, and (ii) rule CCR13 cannot
be modified to give /a/ as the realisation of (a1 } preceding rn, since this does not
occur when the /rn/ belongs to the potential mode -rni (see below section
3.9.3.5). A special allomorph {rna}, occurring only before the
reflexive/reciprocal -rni would need to be proposed in order to account for the
occurring forms. The same problem would arise for the suggestion that +ARNI2
should be segmented into +I+rni. For all of these reasons, I regard +ARNI2 and
+MARNI as distinct classifiers.
        +BINDI is much more restricted in behaviour than the other classifiers. It
occurs only with pronominal prefixes of singular number; the corresponding
plurals occur with the classifier +L For example, nyamaniloondi (from
{nyamani-li+bindi} (big-(lsg)N+BINDI)) 'I grew big', but nyamaniwiddi (from
                               THE VERB PHRASE                                  203
{nyamani-bidd+i} (big-(3pl)N+I)) 'they grew big', or 'they are big'. Furthermore,
+BINDI explicitly refers to the point of accomplishment of the process. and so
is never found with the progressive aspect. Reference to the train of events
leading up to the accomplishment must be made through use of the classifier +I,.
as in nyamaniwangi (from {nyamani-wa-ng+i} (big-PROG+(lsg)N+I)) 'I was
getting big'. It is probably also for this reason that +BINDI is almost never
found in commands, or other uses of language aimed at modifying the behaviour
of the hearer, in all of which cases +I is again favoured. (This is presumablY
because the focus of commands is no engagement in the process over its
completion.) Example:
     (3-106) mangaddi dirib -wi    +nggira1       -woo
             not         enter PRES (2sg)N/PRES/I DEF
             'Don't go inside.'
Compare diribjoondi (from {dirib-ji+bindi} (enter-(2sg)N+BINDI)) 'you entered•.","[180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188]"
"3.9.2 The non-finite verb
Within non-finite clauses, which are always embedded in some other unit
(section 5.5), there occurs a semantically impoverished verbal construction
which consists of either a bare verbal stem, or of a verbal stem followed by an
infinitive, either -bari (section 5.5.3.1) or -mawoo (section 5.5.3.2). As a
constituent of a clause, the non-finite verbal construction ought to be of phrase
level. However, since the only way in which a verbal root may be expanded is
by the addition of a (verbal) stem forming suffix (see section 3.12.2.1), or by
the addition of an infinitive, there seems to be little independent reason to regard
the construction as a phrase, and as a consequence, I do not make this
assumption. In contrast with the finite VP, the non-finite verb carries very little
information about the process: no reference is made to the participants involved
in it, temporal and modal distinctions are not made, and the semantic type of the
process is not indicated.
       When there is no infinitive, the verbal stem, being a bound form, must be
followed by another morpheme, either a postposition or a nominal stem forming
suffix (see 3.12.1.1 below), depending on whether the non-finite clause is
embedded under a PP node or under a word node. (Postpositions and stem
forming suffixes, as distinct from infinitives, are not constituents of the non-
finite verb, as will be shown below, in section 5.5.) Infinitival constructions are
usually found in non-finite clauses attributing on participant roles (section 5.2)
in the finite clauses in which they (the non-finite clauses) are embedded. In the
present data, -ngga ERG is the only postposition that ever follows an infinitive.
(Further fieldwork may uncover other combinations.)3.9.3 The finite verb phrase
Finite VPs occur in non-embedded ""situation"" type clauses (see section 5.2.1),
in which they realise the role of Process. A finite VP consists of two obligatory
constituents, a lexical 'head' referring to the process, and a classifier complex
(CC), which indicates the person and number of the main participants in the
process (see 5.2.1.3 below), tense, and the type of process it is (in terms of the
features described in section 6.5.5 below). In addition to these two obligatory
constituents there are a number of optional elements carrying aspectual, modal
and other qualification of the process. A schematic representation of the VP is
192                                THE WORDgiven in the following formula:
      F1 Process-(Aspect)-(Mood)-CC-(Mode)-(Oblique pronominal)-(Number)
            (1)     (2)     (3)  (4)  (5)          (6)             (7)
where brackets enclose optional elements.
      As was claimed earlier, this unit is a singled-word of phrasal rank; it is
not an inflectional form of the Process lexeme. Its two obligatory constituents
are g-words. The' remaining, optional constituents are enclitics to these words.
That is, these optional constituents do not form g-words with the obligatory
constituents. There is no evidence, for example, that Process plus Aspect is an
inflectional form of the lexical root filling the role of Process, or that the two
together form a distinct stem. In the absence of such evidence, I make the
weakest assumption, that the aspect markers etc. are constituents of the verb
phrase.
      A finite VP may consist of between two and four (perhaps five at the
most) phonological words (as defined in section 2.5.1). The two grammatical
words, the item realising the role of Process, and the CC, are usually distinct
phonological words; but, as mentioned earlier (see pages 128 and 135), the
boundary of the phonological word may move forwards, and so not coincide with
the grammatical boundary. Monosyllabic enclitics are, with one exception,
unstressed and cohere with the preceding phonological word. The exception is
the bound oblique pronominal enclitic -nhi 'to him/her/it', which takes stress.
Enclitic morphemes of two or more syllables are usually phonological words,
and are stressed on their initial syllable. There are just a few exceptions without
initial stress, all of which have an initial {w}, which is affected by VR6: {wila}
FACT (see below 3.9.3.4); the allomorph {wanhi} of the third person singular
oblique pronominal enclitic (see section 3.9.3.6); and the allomorph ( waddi} of
the paucal number enclitic (see section 3.9.3.7).
      It appears that (3) (Mood) and (5) (Mode) in Fl are in complementary
distribution; otherwise there are examples displaying choices from all other
combinations of categories. Some examples (written phonemically) are:

among the individual morphemes realising the functional categories of Fl.

                              Sound effects     The parts-of-speech are classified in the table according to four major
contrasts: (a) free vs. bound; (b) non-verbal vs. verbal; (c) linguistic vs. para-

insufficient to distinguish the classes from one another. They do, however,
provide a useful framework for the discussion of the parts-of-speech and their
interrelations. Individual lexemes are relatively easily assigned values with
respect to these four oppositions - that is, it is relatively easy to assign them
to one of the six major divisions of the table. However, determining their class
from among the possibilities within a single box is not always so easy (except
in the case of verbal items).
      Gooniyandi shows a fundamental distinction between units of the verbal
class versus units of all other classes, at each rank - morpheme, word, phrase,
and perhaps also clause (see section 5.2.1 where situation and relational clauses
are distinguished- situation clauses may be regarded as ""verbal""). Verbal units
(of rank below the clause) are more restricted in distribution than are non-verbal
units, and occur only as constituents of finite verb phrases (VPs), or within non-
finite (embedded) clauses (see section 5.5 below). As has already been
mentioned, non-verbal words and morphemes are less restricted in distribution,
and need not occur in phrases of the same class. As Table 3-1 shows, no verbal
lexical words have the property of independent occurrence; this distinguishes
them from other open class Iexemes. (If an open class lexeme is bound, it must
be a verbal.)
      Similarly, closed verbal classes are readily distinguished from other closed
classes by the fact that they are restricted to occurring in VPs, and from one
another by virtue of their position within the VP (see below, 3.9.3.2). The
verbal stem-forming suffixes form a small set of morphemes which, when
suffixed to verbal lexical roots form new verbal stems, which are also g-words.
By contrast, the verbal enclitics do not form g-units with the forms to which
they are attached. They can be subclassified according as to their position in the
VP (see section 3.9.3). As the term suggests, the classifier complex (CC) can be
analysed into constituent morphemes (as per section 3.9.3.2). However, it is a
g-word, and it might reasonably be regarded as an inflectional form of the
classifier. For this reason, the constituent morphemes (which occur nowhere
else) have not been individually classified.
      Non-verbal lexical items are either free or bound, and this opposition
agrees fairly well with the distinction between open and closed classes. (The
latter correlates better with the distinction between ranking and non-ranking
units- see section 3.1.1.) The three classes of bound non-verbal morphemes
are distinguished from one another by the nature of the unit they form with the
constituent to which they are attached, specifically, whether it is: a g-word, in
140                               THE WORDwhich case the morpheme is a stem forming suffix; a g-phrase, in which case
the morpheme is a postposition; or not a g-unit at all, in which case the
morpheme is an enclitic. The term ""enclitic"" is used throughout this book when
making reference to bound morphemes which do not form grammatical units
with the forms to which they are attached: they retain their grammatical
independence though they do not have distributional independence. The term
""suffix"" is reserved for those morphemes which form g-words with the forms to
which they are attached.
      The two classes, nominals and adverbials are not readily distinguished on
morphological grounds. Most bound morphemes that can be attached to open
class nominals can also be attached to lexemes that we would like to classify as
adverbials. The only exceptions I am aware of are the two number marking
postpositions, -yooddoo 'dual' and -yarndi 'plural', which appear to be
distributionally restricted to nominals. Occurrence, or lack of occurrence with
these two morphemes would not, however, seem to be a useful property on
which to base the definition of a lexical class. But it does appear that this
property correlates with more significant syntagmatic properties. In realising
clausal functions, nominals must occur in NPs or PPs. Although adverbials
may occur in NPs and PPs, when realising clausal roles, they typically do not,
and for every adverbial there is some clausal role that it may realise alone. Thus,
adverbials contrast with PPs in realising circumstantial roles. For adverbials
such roles are not normally mediated through postpositions, as is necessarily the
case for nominal units. The two classes, nominals and adverbials, can thus be
distinguished by the ability or non-ability of their members to realise
circumstantial roles. It follows that adverbials are non-ranking units.
      It would appear that the three lexical classes can be ranged from most
marked distributionally to least marked thus: verbal, nominal, adverbial. The
following generalisation may now be made. Words of the less marked classes
may occur as constituents of phrases of the more marked classes, but words of
the more marked classes do not have this privilege with respect to the less
marked phrasal classes (assuming that markedness corresponds in a natural way
between the word and the phrase classes). Loosely, nominals can ""function as""
verbals, and adverbials can ""function as"" verbals or nominals; but these are the
only possibilities. Open class lexical words can therefore be defined in terms of
their function in the unit next above on the rank scale, as follows:
      VERBALS are those lexemes which must realise the function of Process in
           a VP;
      NOMINALS are those which must either realise a function in an NP, or
•                                                                                        •                                       NOMINAI.S                                  141
              (less frequently) the Process in a VP; and
          ADVERBIALS are those lexemes which may realise functions in clauses,
              NPs, PPs or VPs.
          It is convenient to identify a distinct lexical class of pronominals, even
    though the members usually occur in NPs. There are three main reasons for this:
    (a) distinct forms of pronominals occur for singular vs. non-singular number
    (nominals do not inflect for number); (b) for each pronominal category there are
    at least three distinct phonological shapes, which may be regarded as alternate
    forms of the one pronominallexeme (depending on the context of occurrence);
    and (c) the distribution of pronominals differ significantly from the distribution
    of nominals and other parts-of-speech - for instance, pronominals never occur
    as Processes in VPs. Recognition of the pronominals as a distinct class
    necessitates some fairly obvious and minor adjustments in the definitions of
    nominals and adverbials.
          Particles constitute a small closed class of free ""form"" words which enter
    into syntagms with full clauses, modifying their propositional content.
          Two classes have been set off from the others as paralinguistic. (Further
    research may well uncover more classes of this type.) Paralinguistic words often
    stand as utterances by themselves, constituting ""minor"" clauses: that is, clauses
    that can have one constituent only (cf. section 5.4.2 below). As has been
    mentioned already (section 2.1.1), many of these words are phonologically-
    some even phonetically - irregular.","[123, 124, 125, 126]"
"3.13 Word complexes
Free lexical words can go together to form word complexes, which are syntagms
that are structurally distinct from phrases. In all of the available examples the
relation between the words is that of conjunction or addition - that is, the
logical relationship 'and'. Some illustrative examples are:
      (3-131) wiliddiwiliddi wc[goon.goornoo      ranggan:h]~
              stripe             black            white
              'black and white stripes'
      (3-132) wc[wambz]wc -yooddoo wc[biddidbiya]wc
                 [name]    DU        [name]
              'Wampy and Amee'
where WC =word complex. Note that in (3-131) the word complex realises the
Qualifier role in the NP, while in (3-132) it fulfils the Entity role (see section
4.4.1.2.1 for definitions of the terms Qualifier and Entity).
      It will probably be necessary to distinguish word complexes from
compound words. Yoowooloo-goornboo (man-woman) would seem to be an
example of the latter type. It has a meaning similar to that of reduplications
such as boolgawoolga 'old men'; it means 'people'.

                   This chapter investigates the structure and semantics of the Gooniyandi clause,
                   which as mentioned in section 3.1.1, is the highest ranking grammatical unit in
                   the language.
                         The internal constituency structure of the clause is analysed in sections 5.2
                   to 5.4. Clauses are realised as syntagms of units which may be of phrase rank
                   (that is, units of the types identified in the preceding chapters, NPs, PPs and
                   VPs); or by non-ranking morphemes, adverbials and particles (section 3.1.2); or
                   complexes of ranking and non-ranking units (as described in 4.3.1 and 4.3.2
                   above). However, as is the case for NPs (see section 4.1.1 and 4.1.2.1), a
                   description of clauses in terms of the classes of the constituent units and their
                   linear sequences does not take us very far. It is impossible to provide a general
                   description of the clause in these terms alone; the functions of the units within
                   the units of which they are immediate constituents (in this case clauses) must be
                   taken into account (cf. page 253 above).
                         As argued in section 3.1.1, constituents are linguistic signs, and to each
                   constituent form is associated a function, its role in the unit of which it is an
                   immediate constituent. It seems that, as Halliday has suggested is the case in
                   English (cf. e.g. Halliday 1970 and 1985), there are in Gooniyandi three primary
                   types of function that a clausal constituent may bear, each of which conttibutes
                   a distinct constituency structure to the clause. These primary functions, or
                   metafunctions, are the ideational, textual and interpersonal (Halliday 1985:xiii).
                         (a) The IDEATIONAL meaning of a linguistic element is its expression of
                   ""content"". This type of meaning is of two types. One relates to the
                   representation of the world of experience, including phenomena in it; this is
                   EXPERIENTIAL meaning. The other concerns the 'logical' relations that are
                   imputed to lie between these referent phenomena, or the propositions, or parts of
                   propositions, that express them; this is LOGICAL meaning. Experiential
                 · meaning of the clause is discussed in section 5.2.
        292                               THE CLAUSE              (b) The TEXTUAL meaning of a linguistic element concerns its function in
        the structure of the message, how it provides links with, and relates that element
        to the text of which it is a part, and its extralinguistic context of occurrence.
        This aspect of the meaning and structure of the clause is discussed in section
: ,1'
        5.3.
              (c) INTERPERSONAL meaning concerns the organisation of a linguistic
        element in its role as an interactive event involving the interlocutors of the
        speech situation. A preliminary investigation of some aspects of the
        interpersonal meaning of Gooniyandi clauses is undertaken in section 5.4.
              Having described the internal structure of the clause, attention is then
        turned, in sections 5.5 and 5.6, to constructions involving combinations of
        clauses. There are two main possibilities (cf. Huddleston 1965 and pages 132w
         133 above):
               (i) The clause may be embedded in, and come to function as a constituent
        of another clause or of a phrase in another clause; rarely, a clause is embedded in
        a word. Embedding is not in itself a type of structure, and does not give rise to
        new structures; it is a property of constituents which enter into existing
        structures of a particular type, either clauses or phrases. Embedding is discussed
        in section 5.5.
               (ii) Clauses may be juxtaposed to form complexes - that is, clause
        complexes or complex sentences. These are univariate structures, as distinct
        from the clause and phrase units themselves, which are multivariate structures
         (Halliday 1965/1981). In section 5.6 a preliminary attempt is made at
         identifying the range of logical type relations that occur between the clauses of
         clause complexes.","[233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275, 276]"
"5.2.1.2 Situation clauses (a): modes of being
5.2.1.2.1 Attributive modes
There is a class of situation clauses which have an inherent Attribute, in addition
to a single inherent participant and an inherent Process. These I will refer to as
clauses (or situations) of being, for reasons that will become apparent shortly.
The inherent participant is an Actor/Medium (see below page 323), and this
participant is usually the Carrier, the thing which bears the Attribute, as in the
following example.
             Carrier:              Attribute: Process:
     (5-37) ngaddagi ngaboo        gambi      bagiri
            my       father        sick       he:lies
            'My father is sick.'
The Attribute may of course be ellipsed in case it is given or understood. But if it
does not occur, and is not given, then a clause such as ngaddagi ngaboo bagiri
must mean 'My father is lying down'. In the absence of cues to the contrary, it
will normally be presumed that he is lying asleep.
    However, it is sometimes the case that the Carrier role is conflated with a
non-participant Medium; the Range (see section 5.2.2.2 below). (5-38), for
308                                THE CLAUSEinstance, which has an ellipsed Actor/Medium (the speaker), has as well a non-
participant Medium, the hand, and it is the latter entity which is located.
             Attribute: Carrier: Process:
      (5~38) biliganyi   marla   bagingi
             middle      hand    I:lay
             'My hand only went halfway (i.e. when I reached up to the
                  cupboard).'
      Unlike other situation clauses, constituent order in being clauses is
relatively fixed: the Carrier almost always precedes the Attribute, which almost
always precedes the Process, as the examples in this section demonstrate.
      Three main verbs fill the Process role in clauses of being: bagi- 'lie',
warang- 'sit', and wara- 'stand'. These verbals carry significant semantic content
in being clauses, which are, furthermore, grammatically distinct from verbless
characterising clauses. The two types are NOT synonymous, and the VP is NOT
an optional place-marking copula. In brief, the verbal type makes reference to a
situation, which is a mode of being or existence of the Medium/Carrier,
concomitant with its carrying the Attribute; in the verbless type the Carrier is
characterised by its possession of the Attribute (see McGregor forthcoming-f for
further elaboration on this point). Evidence for my claims is set out below.
      Firstly, the choice between verbal and non-verbal clause is significant.
Verbal clauses describe a situation in which the Attribute holds; verbless clauses
characterise the Carrier by its possession of the Attribute. This distinction
between characterisation and engagement in a situation approximates, but does
not coincide with at least two other oppositions that might be evoked to
characterise the difference between verbal and verbless clauses which attribute
qualities of things. They are: (i) the difference between permanent and temporary
possession of the Attribute; and (ii) the difference between present and past
possession of the Attribute (the relevant times may be with respect to either the
speech situation or the referent events).
       In many instances verbal clauses do show temporary, and/or past
 Attributes. For example,
      (5-39) ngamoo bagingi
             before I:lay
             'I used to be (a good hunter).'
and (5-45). Most Attributes referring to mental states also, predictably, usually
occur in verbal clauses (see examples (5-76) and (5-113)). The choice of verbal

                                    THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION                             309
            clauses in circumstances such as these is, I suggest, determined by the fact that
            the Carrier cannot be characterised by the Attribute unless the Attribute holds at
            the time of speech or the time established in the text, and has been held
            continuously for some time.
                  Test cases arise when the Carrier CAN be characterised by the Attribute, but
            is not. To illuminate this distinction, consider the following three examples:
                  (5-40) gilbali dijbari bagiyi
                         I:found:it broken it:lay
                         'I found it (i.e. a knife) broken.'
                  (5-41) manyi goolyingi langa yijgawoo
                         food      I:tasted:it salty too
                         'I tasted the food; it was salty, and no good.'
                  (5-42) yoolajlimi      thiddgirli -rni bagiyi
                         I:pulled:it:out straight SEQ it:lay
                         'Then I pulled (the wire) out straight.'
            The temporal relation of the condition of the knife to the process of finding in
            (5-40) is parallel to the condition of the food in (5-41) when it was tasted. The
            difference is that in the first example the knife was found in a condition, and in
            the second, the food was tasted, and found to be salty: it was not tasted in its
            mode of being. In (5-40) the Attribute of the knife, its being broken, is a
            permanent as any of the Attributes illustrated in section 5.2.1.1.2 above. What
            (S-40) does is describe a situation, a mode of being of the knife when it was
            found. In other words, whereas (5-40) describes the circumstances, treating the
            condition of the knife as a situation, (5-41) adds a characterisation of the food -
            and its mode of being is irrelevant. The point is that the situation described in
            (5-40) could equally well be described in the verbless clause nayoo dijbari 'the
            knife is/was broken'. If this mode of expression were employed, the full
            utterance of (5-40) would be better rendered into English as 'He found the knife;
            it was broken' (compare (5-41)). Similarly, in (5-42) the verbal Attributive
            clause makes reference to the SITUATION the wire was in as a result of the
            action.
                  To summarise, the speaker may (in certain cases) choose to treat an
            Attribute as a characteristic of the Carrier, or alternatively as an aspect of its
            mode of being. This is a real choice, determined by the way in which the speaker
            decides to represent the referent reality. In a sense, the choice of a characterising
            clause allows a narrator to move out of his role of recounting events, and to
            .       'f

                          place his own - or by implication, an agent's - interpretation or comments on
                          them. Another way of putting it is that characterising clauses assert LOGICAL
                          type relationships between entities and qualities, whereas attributive clauses of
                          being express EXPERIENTIAL meaning (see section 5.1 above). This is in
                          keeping with the fact that the fanner type resembles phrase complexes, the
                          constituents of which are logically related. It is noteworthy that a similar
                          semantic contrast underlies the opposition between verbal and verbless
                          existential clauses: verbal existential clauses refer to situations of existence;
                          verbless existential clauses indicate or point to an existent.
                                Consideration of one final example demonstrates these points clearly. As
                          might be expected, the nominal mooyoo 'sleep' normally occurs in verbal
                          attributive clauses of being, with the verb bagi- 'lie', in reference to the act of
                          sleeping. There is, however, a single example in the corpus in which this word ·
                          occurs in a non-situation clause:
                                (543) wardjiwiddangi       bidi.yooddoo mooyoo
                                       he:went:up:to:them they:two        sleep
                                       'He went up to them; they were asleep.
                          In keeping with my earlier remarks, the second clause of this example seems to
                          be added as an afterthought, reminding the hearer of the fact that the two men
                          were asleep (a fact which had been previously mentioned in the text).
                                Secondly, the choice of verbal is meaningful. If the Carrier remains in a
                          particular posture throughout the duration of the time it has the Attribute, the
                          choice between the verbs of stance depends on the following (cf. Goddard
                          1985:38, Simpson 1983:402):
                          bagi- 'lie' occurs if the entity adopts a reclining or horizontal position, or has
                               significantly greater extent horizontally than vertically.
                          warang- 'sit' occurs if the posture is a sitting one, or where the body as a whole
                               adopts neither a horizontal nor a vertical orientation, and has roughly
                               comparable horizontal and vertical extents.
                          wara- 'stand' occurs when the position is vertical, that is, when there is
                               significantly greater vertical than horizontal extent, or where a significant
                               part of the entity has vertical orientation.
                              Of the three verbs, bagi- 'lie' appears to be the least marked one
                          semantically, and is used when the entity adopts no particular posture, and is
                          completely inactive in an abstract situation of being. For example,
                       THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION                              311      (5-44) jirigi yingi -ngaddi     bagiri

Bagi- 'lie', that is, appears to have a general existential sense - i.e. existence in

such as 'remain' (as in 'I ate them and only one remained'), 'exist as a result of a
change' (as in 'A tadpole changes and a frog results'), 'live' (see section 5.2.1.2.3
below), and 'exist' (see section 5.2.1.2.2).
Perhaps this helps to explain the facts concerning 'mental qualities': the least
active and most abstract (e.g. mooyoo 'sleep' and binaddi 'know, knowledgeable')
typically occur with bagi- 'lie'. On the other hand, the less abstract mental
qualities tend to occur with one of the other verbs of posture. Thus, damarda
'blunt' and wangmadda 'mad' occur with the verb warang- 'sit', with the senses 'be
deaf (i.e. have blunt ears) and 'be mad' respectively.","[291, 292, 293, 294, 295]"
"5.2.1.1.2 Characterising clauses
Whereas identifying clauses identify an entity in terms of an alternative
designation, characterising clauses 'characterise' an entity in tenns of some
property, quality, location, use, etc.. That is, they add something new to the
characterisation of a thing. For example, (5-14) characterises the meat referred to
by NP1 as rotten (NP0.
      (5-14) NPt[ngirndaji maa]NP1 NP2[thoowoorndoo]NP2
                 this      meat       rotten
             'This meat is rotten.'
.....   ""}   '   .       --
                                        THE CLAUSE AS REPRESENTATION                             299
                 This clause does not identify the meat; rather, it indicates a quality or
                 characteristic of the meat. Characterising clauses thus consist of two inherent
                 roles, an Attribute and a Carrier of that Attribute (I use these terms following
                 Halliday 1985), and the Attribute is asserted as characterising the Carrier.
                       There are a number of grammatical differences between identifying and
                 characterising clauses in Gooniyandi; they are not just logically distinguishable
                 types. Firstly, the Attribute is invariably realised by an NP WITH A QUALIFIER
                 and an optional Entity, but no pre-Entity roles, or by a PP. On the other hand,
                 both the Identifier and the Identified are always realised by NPs with overt Entity
                 or pre-Entity roles, but NO post-Entity Qualifier; nor may they be realised by
                 PPs. This difference in form justifies distinguishing the Attribute from the
                 Identifier and Identified (cf. Halliday 1985:xx, Fawcett 1987:178, Martin
                 1987: 18), and as a result the contrast between identifying and characterising
                 clauses.
                       A second, derivative difference is that constituent order in intensive
                 identifying clauses is free, and the Identifier may precede or follow the Identified,
                 whereas in characterising clauses constituent order is relatively rigid. The Carrier
                 usually comes first, making it Theme (section 5.3.2). In the few examples of
                 the reverse order, the Carrier and the Attribute NPs come on distinct intonation
                 contours, typically with a pause between them, and a rise on the first contour.
                 This is a tagging construction (see page 376), and the Carrier is still Theme. An
                 example is:
                      (5-15) joodoo I ngaddagi garingi I
                             straight my             wife
                             'My wife is straight (i.e. of the correct subsection) for me?'
                 These facts can be explained as follows (cf. Halliday 1985:114): intensive
                 identifying clauses make reference to two entities, either of which is a potential
                 Theme. By contrast, characterising clauses refer to a single entity, the Carrier.
                 Because of the preference in Gooniyandi for thematising entities over qualities or
                 processes (see below page 378), the Carrier is the natural choice of theme. (Note
                 that this also explains why exemplifying and naming identifying clauses (see
                 above) are irreversible.)
                      Thirdly, only (some) characterising clauses, but NO identifying clauses,
                 have situation clause agnates with an inherent Process referring to the mode of
                 'being' of the Carrier (see section 5.2.1.2.1). And fourthly, as we will see, the
                 two types have distinct, non-parallel subtypes.
                      The Carrier is as a rule realised by an NP making reference to some entity
                 -a person, animal or topographic feature (tree, river, hill, etc.). However, in a
300                                 THE ClAUSEnumber of instances (under circumstances which are not as yet clear), a place is
treated as a Location for the Attribute, and the Carrier is realised by the Nominal
riwi 'country, place'. This construction is invariably used in saying that a place
is hot or cold:
      (5-16) yiyili -ya       riwi       boordbara
                       LOC country hot
             'It is hot at Yiyili', or 'Yiyili is hot'
No instances of the type yiyili boordbara 'Yiyili is hot' occur in the corpus.
However, the Carrier riwi 'country, place' may be omitted, and clauses such as
yiyiliya boordbara 'It is hot at Yiyili' do occur. I regard such clauses as elliptical,
rather than having a Locative PP as Carrier, since riwi 'country, place' may
always be added.
However, I do not suggest this explanation as valid for the following example,
which described a flower with a red centre.
       (5-17) biliga thiwa
              middle red
              'The middle is red.'
This is for two reasons. Firstly, I know of no word which could be used to refer to
the place, the centre of a flower, in the same way as riwi 'country, place' refers to
the place in (5-16). And secondly, spatial adverbials are attested in NP roles, and
it is not unreasonable to assume that biliga 'middle' is fulfilling the role of Entity
in the first NP of (5-17).
     The construction exemplified by (5-16) is sometimes used to indicate that a
place is 'good'; alternatively, the place itself may be the Carrier. The latter seems
to normally occur in the sense of 'good for some purpose' - see example
(5-299) below -rather than 'good in appearance'.
     There are three main types of characterising clauses: [1] intensive, in which
the Attribute indicates a property or quality of the Carrier (x is a y); [2]
circumstantial, in which a location, origin, purpose, etc. is attributed of the
Carrier; and [3] possessive, in which a possession is attributed to the Carrier.
[1] Intensive. Examples of intensive characterising clauses include (5-14) and
(5-15) above. The Attribute is normally realised by an NP which consists of a
Qualifier only; sometimes the NP has an Entity, but pre-Entity roles appear
never to be realised (as mentioned previously). It follows that corresponding to
each characterising clause there is usually a single NP consisting of the same
words in the same order, in which the Qualifier of the NP corresponds to the
Attribute of the clause. For example, to (5-14) there corresponds the NP
[ngirndaji maa thoowoorndoo] 'this rotten meat'. Intensive characterising clause

"5.5.1 Nominalisations and adverbialisations
5.5.1.1 -mili CHAR
Example (5-269) shows -mili CHAR in syntagm with a (part of a) non-finite
clause. The whole construction of Knrmili is functionally a nominal word. In
(5-269) this word is the sole constituent of an NP realising the Attribute in a
relational clause, which characterises an individual (the fly) by its habitual
engagement in a process. In (5-270) the derived -mili CHAR nominal is a
Qualifier in an NP with an overt Entity.
                 Entity:   Qualifier:
      (5-270) NP[goornboo moorniny -milz1NP jagmingadda
                 woman     fuck       CHAR she:told:to:me
              'The promiscuous woman told me .. .'
      The thing qualified or attributed on, as in examples (5-269) and (5-270), is
usually the Actor in the non-finite clause, as might be expected from the fact
that the morpheme -mili CHAR indicates something in active association with
an entity (see above page 232). However, in all available examples, the Actor
phrase has been ellipsed. But there are examples in which Mediums and Manners
have not been ellipsed:
      (5-271) [boolga] N[Knf[mawoolyi ngab]Knf -mili]N
               old:man       children eat       CHAR
              'The old man was a child-eater.'

              thus SEM REP                  fast       go        CHAR
              '(I'm) also a fast walker, like that.'
     There is one problematical example, the analysis and interpretation of
which remains uncertain:

             mosquito ERG bite IT CHAR night
This was given freely in response to the prompt 'Mosquitoes always bite at
night'. However, similar examples which I constructed myself involving ERG
PPs were rejected by native speakers of Gooniyandi.
      If the 'single mother' condition (Sampson 1975) is rejected, (5-273) might
be analysed as follows:
      (5-274) Carrier: NP                   Attribute: NP
                   /                                   I

                           ~p

                                      wird- -birli -mili        maninggaAlternatively, it could be claimed that the Carrier in the relational clause is
ellipsed, being coreferential with the Agent of the embedded clause.
There are other possibilities: in particular, it is possible that the above
interpretation of (5-273) is mistaken. It could perhaps mean 'mosquito biting time
is night time' - or, more literally, 'mosquito biting is a characteristic of
nighttime'. Should this interpretation prove justified the claim made above for
coreferentiality of the Carrier and the Actor must be rejected. In any event,
(5-274) provides further evidence of the clausal status of the unit -mili CHAR
enters into constituency with.5.5.1.2 -gali .... -(w )ali .... -yali GD
There are too few instances of this morpheme in syntagm with a clause to
permit a general description. It may be presumed that it has similar properties
and functions as -mili CHAR. An example is:
             Carrier: NP Attribute: NP
     (5-275) goornboo NP[N[woob -galz1N]NP
             woman            cook GD
             'The woman is a cook.'
396                              THE ClAUSE
5.5.1.3 -wa MD
In all available examples (which number over one hundred) -wa MD
constructions consist of a single constituent, a verbal stem, in syntagm with
-wa MD. So it is not clear whether a full clause or just a verbal is in syntagm
with this morpheme. For convenience and consistency I will assume the former,
that is, that -wa MD does form a syntagm with a full (albeit elliptical) clause.
As was suggested above (page 245), -wa MD indicates a 'way' or mode of being
or action. And thus -wa MD clauses normally indicate situations in which an
entity is involved, concomitant with or as a result of its engagement in the main
situation (referred to by the fmite clause). For example:
      (5-276) bam -ga wajladdi -nhi
              return MD I:threw:it to:him
              'I threw it back to him.'
When the entity is an Agent in the finite clause, -wa MD is followed by -ngga
ERG:
      (5-277) m1rd -ga -ngga thiddi rooddijbiddarni
              go    MD ERG fight they:argued:together
              They argued going along.'
However, when this entity is an Actor/Medium either -wadda MNR (see next
section) is used instead of -wa MD, or else -wa MD is followed by the
postposition -ngga ERG. The choice depends on whether the non-finite clause
indicates a manner of action, in which case -wadda MNR occurs, or an attribute,
in which case -wa-ngga MD-ERG occurs:
      (5-278) warang -ga -ngga bagiri
              sit       MD ERG he:lies
              'He's sleeping sitting up.'
      (5-279) mangaddi wara -a      -ngga jijagginggiddawoo
              not        stand MD ERG you:are:talking
              Don't stand talking.'
     -wa-ngga MD-ERG clauses, of which (5-277) to (5-279) are typical
examples, indicate secondary processes in which the Agent/Actor is involved
while s/he is engaged in the main process. The secondary processes are thus
normally extendible; and furthermore, they usually require effort on the part of
the Agent/Actor in order to be maintained. They are never happenings.
                             NON-FINITE ClAUSES                               397     However, the Goal attributes, such as (5-276}, are typically resultative;
they normally indicate a resulting condition of the Goal subsequent to the main
process. -wa MD clauses also attribute on Ranges, where they are again
typically resultative. For example,
     (5-280) barn -ga ngangjawinyji
             return MD I:will:give:it:to:you
             'I'll give it back to you.'5.5.1.4 -wadda M N R
I have suggested (page 246) that this suffix forms adverbials from words of other
classes, which indicate the Manner in which an action was done. As a rule, non-
finite -wadda MNR clauses occur in intransitive clauses, normally clauses of
motion:
     (5-281) galgal -aH1    wardji
             laugh MNR he:went
             'He went along laughing.'
     (5-282) ruch -atJa wardji
             cry   MNR he:went
             'He went along crying.'
There is a single example in which the -wadda MNR clause occurs in a main
clause of directed action:
     (5-283) birdi bandaddang -gadth. -ngga       thoolnglimi -nhi
             leg stiff             MNR ERG        !:kicked       on:him
             'I kicked him stiff-legged.'
(Compare the attributes in examples (5-277) to (5-279). Note also that example
(5-283) shows a nominal birdi 'leg', in constituency with the non-finite verb
bandaddang- '(be) stiff, providing some evidence in favour of the view that it is a
full clause that is embedded under the word node in examples (5-281) to (5-283).)5.5.2 Non-finite clauses in postpositional phrases
5.5.2.1 -nhingi ABL1
The ablative postposition -nhingi, when fonning a syntagm with a non-finite
clause, usually indicates that that process is a cause of the main process (the one
referred to by the finite clause). For example,
398                              THE ClAUSE      (5-284) pp[:rwfgamba ngoorloog]Knf -nhingz]pp yalijlimi
                     water drink             ABL        I:got:sick
              'I got sick from drinking grog.'
      (5-285) mamba jayali       pp[warang -nhingi]pp
              bum    I:got:sore sit          ABL
              'My bum is sore from sitting.'
     However, embedded -nhingi ABL1 clauses do not cover the entire range of
causal relations. It seems that the main process must be a result of the
engagement of the Actor in the non-finite process, and this participant must be a
Medium in the fmite clause (cf. section 5.2.3.6 above).
In (5-268) the Entity (the footprint), may be regarded as (coming into existence
as) a consequence of the process of walking. Note however that the Entity thinga
'footprint' is not a participant in the process of walking; but this does not
prevent it from being qualified by the process.5.5.2.2 -yangga ABL 2
There is a single example in which the postposition -yangga ABL2 is attached to
a verbal root, and presumably, to the clause to which this root belongs. That is
(5-262) above. The relevant part is repeated here:
      (5-286) marla -ya      moorda dijbindinhi         goorij -jangga
              hand LOC really          it:broke:on:him hold      AB~
              '(The knife) broke in his hand from holding (it).'
The difference between -yangga AB~ and -nhingi ABL 1 would appear to be as
described in section 3.7.2.5. See also section 5.2.3.6.5.5.2.3 -ngaddi COMIT
There is only one potential example in the corpus of -ngaddi COMIT attached to
a verbal stem, and so presumably also to a clause,
      (5-287) NP[warlibiddz]NP pp[Knffv[wilaj -ban]v]Knf -ngaddz]w
                river                  around CTV         COMIT
              The river is windy.'
(See above page 241.)
In Ungarinyin (Rumsey 1982b:146ff) the cognate morpheme -ngaddi is a regular
marker of relative clauses, and is attached to a fmite form of the verb.

5.5.2.4 -woo DAT
-Woo, the allomorph of the dative postposition that occurs with verballexemes,
forms a rather impoverished type of embedded clause, which is frequently a
purposive:
      (5-288) thangarndi walmajaddi jijag -goo       W(U'djawooddoo
              wool                    speak PAT they:are:going
              'They're going (somewhere) to talk Walmajarri.'
      (5-289) giningi ngardgimarni gamba -ya        nyoomboolwani
              breath he:breathes     water LOC he:dives:in
              marnangooddoo doorloog -goo
              far              come:up DAT
              'He takes a deep breath as he dives into the water, to come up far
                  away.'
      (5-290) gamba -ya      nyoombool -woo malabmingami
              water LOC swim                DAT I:did:myself:up
              'I did up my hair for a swim in the water.'
      (5-291) diwinyi wayandi jard -goo
              tinder    frre       light DAT
              'Tinder is for lighting fires.'
These examples demonstrate fairly conclusively the clausal status of the
constituent which -woo DAT enters into syntagmatic relations with. However,
it must be noted that the clause is in many ways reduced. Most usually there is
no constituent other than the verbal stem. And only a subset of the possible
clause functions (as described in section 5.2) have actually been encountered in a
-woo DAT clause. For example, there are no examples of ERG or ABL PPs
although there are examples of most other PP types, adverbials and particles.
      The -woo DAT clause has three major functions: (i) to attribute a purpose
or use of an entity; (ii) to indicate the purpose or reason of an action; and (iii) to
indicate a circumstance of Matter, with respect to which a quality holds of an
entity, or the respect in which an action was done (cf. section 5.2.3.8).
      (i) Examples of -woo DAT clauses as Attributes in characterising clauses
are (5-21) above and
      (5-292) biddi      [[yood] -woo     fgooddoomba -ya]]
              charcoal put        DAT paper            LOC
              'A pencil is for writing on paper.'
400                               THE CLAUSESuch clauses indicate the function or use of an entity. Attributes also occur in at
least one other clause type. (5-293) shows a -woo DAT clause attributing on the
Existent in an existential clause.
      (5-293) nginyji -ga  baamangaddagi           manyi
              you      ERG you:will:call:out:to:me food
              ngirndaji -ya     ngab -goo
              this       LOC eat       DAT
              You'll call out to me ""There's food here to eat"".'
(Contrast ngirndaji manyi ngabgoo (this food eat-DAT) 'this food is to eat'.)
However, I have no evidence that this non-finite clause type can attribute on a
participant (or anything else in a situation clause. (See also (ii) below.)
      (ii) Clauses (5-288) to (5-290) are examples of the second type of -woo
DAT clause, which indicates the purpose or reason for the occurrence of the
main process.
      (iii) Circumstances of Matter indicate something with respect to which the
action of the main clause was done, or with respect to which a quality obtains of
an entity. Examples of the first type typically involve mental process types, in
which the -woo DAT clause indicates a situation perceived or thought about.

     -Woo DAT clauses may be fractured (see page 282 above~ and McGregor

              'A bed is for sleeping in.'

             'He'll take us to see the country.'
My analysis of such examples is that there is a pair of juxtaposed PPs ([bagoo-
woo] 'for lying' and [mooyoo-yoo] 'for sleeping' in (5-300)) within the main
clause, parts of which still constitute a non-finite clause. That is, I reject the
'single mother' condition (Sampson 1975); this obviates the need for
transformations, and allows all of the structure to be shown in a single tree.
Mooyoo 'sleep' is related both to bagoo- 'lie' as an Attribute, and to bunk of the
main clause through the intermediate PP (which is an Attribute), and this is
shown in the present analysis, which is summarised in the following tree:

                          sleep       DAT         lie-         DATBy fracturing, a nominal constituent of the embedded clause is made prominent
in the main clause, through its being set off as an attribute or circumstance         \
beside the process itself. For this to be possible, the constituent fractured must
be a potential filler of the role in the main clause. The juxtaposed PPs elaborate
                                                                                      l
on one another. These circumstances normally arise when the constituent
fractured realises an Attribute or Goal in the embedded clause as well, as in the
examples above (i.e. (5-300) to (5-303)). However, Ranges and Spatial
circumstances, if they are realised by adverbials, may also be fractured.
      It should be clear from the examples given so far that there are no             I
constraints on coreference of major participant roles between the -woo DAT
clause and the main clause. In Attributive clauses the thing attributed on always
(logically) plays some role in the -woo DAT clause. This may be: Instrument,
as in (5-292); Goal, as in (5-296); or Location, as in (5-304), at least. In the
situation clauses so far there is also some entity in common between the two
clauses. This entity is (in the examples above) an Actor in the -woo clause, and
either an Actor or Goal in the main clause (respectively examples (5-294) and (5-
302).)
      However, matters are more complicated than this. In (5-305) the natural
interpretation is that the Actors of the process of speech are both the speaker and
a third person, respectively Agent and Goal of the main clause.
      (5-305) ngimbiddjila      JZ]ag -goo thangamdi -yoo
              I:hurried:him:up speak DAT weed         DAT
              'I hurried him up for a talk.'
Surely it is not a monologue by the third person that is being referred to, even
though it was used to describe a language elicitation session with a Gooniyandi
                             NON-FlNITE CLAUSES                               403speaker. If such a strict interpretation is insisted upon, the following example is
sufficient to prove that the Actor of the -woo DAT clause need have no role in
the main clause. It also refers to my going to a language session, and was given
to me as an utterance appropriate to the circumstance of visiting a potential
collaborator.
     (5-306) wardngi thangarndi -yoo          jijag -goo
             I:went     word      DAT         speak DAT
             'I came for a talk.'
(No one would have imagined that I would have intended to monologue!)
      The natural interpretation of both (5-305) and (5-306) is that the
speaker/Actor of the main clause is one of the interactants in the speech act
referred to by the embedded clause. Strictly speaking there are no coreferential
nominal phrases between the two clauses in these two examples. Indeed, it is
not even certain that there must be some shared entity between the two clauses.
In (5-307), for example, there is some evidence that the embedded clause has
Actor dimana 'horse'.
     (5-307) galyjini -yoo giddagidda -woo di.manLl ngamoo
             fast      DAT run         DAT horse    before
              marooddawoonmarni
              they:gathered:together
              'They are already meeting for the horse races.'
The fact that galjini 'fast', but not dimana 'horse' has been fractured from the
embedded clause suggests that the purpose of the meeting was the race (""speed""),
rather than to race the horses. The latter sense would be conveyed more naturally
by fracturing dimana 'horse' (see page 401 above). (Furthennore, the verb
giddagidda 'run' is not, to my knowledge, used in the context of directed action,
'to race something'.)
       There are a number of instances in which a -woo DAT clause appears at
first to be independent For example,
     (5-308) mangaddi bambam -goo I yilba              wardgiri I
             not         return    DAT for.good        he:goes
             'He can't return; he goes on forever.'
     (5-309) mangaddi ngambiddi gijgij -goo I yilba       gardbiddini I
             not         again        get:up DAT for:good they:hit:him
             'He can't get up again; they killed him.'
404                                 TiiEClAUSEIn these two examples the non-finite clause is clearly not a circumstance of the
fmite clause; furthermore, there is an intonation break which does not occur in
the embedded -woo DAT clauses above. In constructions of this type, the -woo
DAT verb preceded by the negative particle indicates a strong degree of
unlikeliness or impossibility. It may be because of a social constraint (as in
(5-308), referring to the fact that he will not return to the scene of the murder),
or a physically determined disability (as in (5-309)).
       A clue to the interpretation of this construction is afforded by the
following example, in which the occurrence of the DAT postposition on thiddi
'fight' suggests that the -woo clause is indeed embedded. (It appears that thiddi
'fight' has been fractured from the -woo DAT clause.)
      (5-310) marlami I jiginya -girli         I mangaddi     thiddi    -yoo
              nothing   little   really               not     fight     DAT
              gardboo -woo I
              belt      DAT
              'No, he's still too little to fight.'
This suggests that the initial clauses of (5-308) and (5-309), set off by
intonation, are relational characterising clauses perhaps with the Carriers
ellipsed. (5-309) might then be analysed as follows:
      (5-311) mangaddi wfxm[ngambiddi gijgiJ]Knf -goo]pp
              not               again  getup      DAT
              'He can't get up again.'
(Compare example (5-273).)
      The ellipsed Carrier might therefore be assumed to be the Actor of the non-
finite clause. More appropriate paraphrases for (5-308) and (5-309) might be
then, 'he is not to return ... ',and 'he was not to get up again'. Unfortunately,
there is no independent evidence for this proposal: there are no examples in
which the Carrier role (in the main clause) is expressed linguistically by an NP
which also fulfils the role of Actor in the non-finite clause. There are, however,
a couple of examples which appear to have a Carrier NP (not coreferential with
the Actor of the non-finite clause):
      (5-312) barnloondi yilba   niyaji          mangaddi   ngambiddi
              I:retmned for:good this            not        again
              bambam -goo
              return    DAT
              'I came back for good; I can't go back (there) again.'
                             NON-FINITE CLAUSES                               405A possible interpretation for this is that niyaji 'this' is here functioning much
like it in English- i.e. 'it is not (possible for me) to return' (see above pages
144-145 for a discussion of niyaji 'this'). A second possible example is
     (5-313) mangaddi diddib -goo riwi biliga
             not      camp DAT place middle
             ""We won't make camp half-way."" (speaker's gloss)
It is possible that riwi biliga 'half-way place' constitutes an NP and that (5-313)
means, more literally, 'a half-way place is not the right (place) to camp'. (5-314)
provides evidence of a different type: the initial relational clause is reworded in
the form of a situation clause:
     (5-314) nyamani warang -goo ngirndaji -ya  garndiwangooddoo
             big     sit     DAT this       LOC many
              winhi    waranggiddi ngirndaji -ya
              nothing we:sit        this        LOC
              'We're too many for this place; too many of us live here.'
     Rather than disprove the suggestion above that the Actor of the non-finite
clause is the Carrier in the main clause, the last few remarks indicate that there
are other possibilities for the Carrier role. And it could be that the Actor is the
unmarked choice, understood unless another NP occurs instead. The strong
negative sense of examples (5-308) to (5-310) may be due to the fact that the
clause is characterising, and states a permanent association between the two
major constituents.5.5.2.5 -ya LOC and -goowaya PROG-LOC
There are only a few examples of the locative postposition -ya directly following
a verbal stem. In all of them it indicates a concomitant process that the Agent or
Actor (depending on the clause type) is engaged in. For example,
     (5-315) jijaggooddarni            joodoog -ja
             they:are:talking:together straight LOC
             'They're talking together straightening words:
     (5-316) warangngi waddgoom -ja
             I:sat        work        LOC
             'I sat working/at work.'
     Far more frequent is the verbal stem followed by -goowaya, which would
appear to be segmentable into the verbal morpheme -goowa PROG followed by
406                                THE CLAUSEthe postposition -ya LOC - note, however, that the evidence is not fully
convincing on this point. For example,
      (5-317) danymiliyiddra jijag -goowaya
              we:hear.them talk PROG-LOC
              We hear them talking.'
In finite VPs the progressive aspect -goowa normally refers to the 'train' of
events leading up to or following the point of accomplishment of a process,
depending on the type of process (see section 6.5.2). It usually occurs with
accomplishment classifiers (see section 6.5.5), and verballexemes that occur
with them. It does not usually - in finite VPs - refer to the continuation of
an extendible process (although there are a few examples). However, it may
reasonably be argued that the progressive does not usually occur with non-
accomplishment classifiers because the infonnation it carries is already carried by
the obligatory classifier, NOT because it is incompatible with these classifiers.
      Non-finite -goowaya PROG-LOC and -ya LOC clauses are 'conditional'
attributes (see section 5.2.4); they indicate qualities (involvement in a process)
that are 'incidental' to the involvement of the entity in the process. The
-goowaya PROG-LOC clause indicates a process that is temporally contiguous
with the main clause, and which is homogeneous throughout. Moreover, it
attributes a 'quality' (i.e. engagement in a process) of an entity, which obtains
throughout the duration of the main process. Similarly, the (plain) -ya locative
clauses of (5-315) and (5-316) are Agent/Actor attributes.
      The carrier of the Attribute may, apparently, fulfil any major transitivity
role, at least in the main clause, but it is always (in the available examples) the
Agent or intransitive Medium in the non-finite clause. Some examples are:
• Attributing on an Agent
      (5-318) ngooddab -goowaya        thiddi -ngga jagarndinginbidi
              shout     PROG-LOC fight ERG they:woke:me:up
             'They woke me up yelling and arguing.'
• Attributing on a Goal
      (5-319) middag                 -goowaya       baabiddi gilbali
              lie (avoidance style) PROG-LOC below            I:found:him
              'I noticed her (i.e. my mother-in-law) lying below.'
(It is generally the Goal of a clause of perception that is attributed on by a
-goowaya clause.)

Finally I remark that in no example is there a sister constituent for the non-
finite VP. It is not clear, then, whether the examples in this section properly
involve embedded/non-finite clauses, or just non-finite VPs.","[378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391]"
" 1.2 Territory and surrounding languages
  The Gooniyandi people traditionally occupied quite a large tract of land,
 extending from Fitzroy Crossing in the west to the vicinity of Margaret River
 Station in the east, a distance of some one hundred and fifty kilometres, west to
 east. This territory abuts on the Great Sandy Desert in the south, and extends
 into the King Leopold Ranges in the north. Two large rivers, the Margaret River
 and Christmas Creek, as well as a number of smaller creeks, water the
 countryside, which is predominantly river flats intersected by numerous
 limestone ranges. The approximate extent of the Gooniyandi territory, as well as
 the territories of the neighbouring peoples, is shown on Map 1 (see also Tindale
 1974).
       The languages spoken in the vicinity are representatives of five distinct
 language families, according to O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966), and
 Wurm (1972)- compare Capell (1940) and (1956/1966). Although it has more
recently been suggested that aJl Australian Aboriginal languages (with two or
 three possible exceptions) belong to a single family (Dixon 1980:3), genetic
relations between these five families have not yet been conclusively
demonstrated.
       Walmajarri, Jaru, and Wangkajunga, traditionally spoken to the south and
east of Gooniyandi, are the local representatives of the Pama-Nyungan family,
which covers most of the Australian continent (see e.g. map facing page 112 of
Wurm 1972). The Jarrakan (Djeragan, in older spelling) family, of which Kija is
a member, was located to the north and north-east of Gooniyandi; languages of
the Nyulnyulan family, which includes Nyikina, were spoken to the west of
Gooniyandi; the Worrorran (elsewhere spelled Wororan) languages, including
Worrorra and Ungarinyin, were spoken to the north and north-west of Bunuba,

      The two members of the Bunuban family, Gooniyandi and Bunuba, arc
fairly close genetic relatives, and are lexically, grammatically, and typologically
quite similar. They are perhaps as similar as Italian and Spanish. There is also
quite a high degree of bilingualism in the two languages, especially among lhe
older generation of Gooniyandi and Bunuba people.
      The phonological inventories of Gooniyandi and Bunuba are identical
except that Bunuba has a phonemically distinct lamina-dental lateral phoneme
/lh/ (Alan Rumsey pers.comm.), not found in Gooniyandi. Gooniyandi and
Bunuba showed a cognate density of about 45% on a 138 item list, which
included lhe 100 items of Hale's core vocabulary for Australian languages (the
words marked by double asterisks in Sutton and Walsh 1979), plus some other
starred words from an AIAS word list current as of 22/1/1975 (Rumsey
pers.comm.). A count of some of the more frequent and easily segmentable
bound morphemes (36 in number) showed a somewhat higher cognate rate of
66%. The verbal constructions in the two languages are quite similar. But
 whereas in Gooniyandi the verbal complex is a minimal free form in which the
 verbal stem and the classifier complex (see section 3.9.3.2) are bound to one
 another, in Bunuba one of the verbal auxiliaries (which arc the Bunuba
 counterparts of Gooniyandi classifiers), namely -ma, has the privilege of free
 occurrence (Rumsey pers.comm.).
       The Bunuban family differs in a number of typological respects from the
 surrounding families. For example, unlike the Worrorran and Jarrakan families,
 noun classes are not distinguished, and the nominal phrase exhibits ergative
 marking. Secondly, the lamina-palatal vs. lamina-dental contrast in stops and
 nasals is found in the Bunuban and Jarrakan languages, but not in the nearby
 Pama-Nyungan or Nyulnyulan languages, and in only one Worrorran language,
                     GOONIYANDI CULTURE AND SOCIETY                                7namely Unggumi (which is geographically contiguous with Bunuba).
      However, the five families are by no means totally dissimilar, and there are
a number of common features shared by two or more families, or pairs of
languages from different families. A number of these similarities are fairly
certainly the result of areal diffusion; none can be said with certainty to be
retentions from putative earlier proto-languages. For example, all of the
languages shown on Map 1 have bound pronominals which cross-reference
certain actants in the clause. In the non-Pama-Nyungan languages, they are
typically prefixed to the verbal auxiliary (or classifier in the case of Gooniyandi),
while in the Pama-Nyungan languages they are suffixed to a ""catalyst"" (Capell
1956/1966: 11), or to the first word of a clause. It is also likely that at some
stage the preverb-auxiliary construction, as it may be called (following
McConvell pers.comm.), typical of most languages in the area, including the
Pama-Nyungan ones, was diffused. Such a construction is undoubtedly the
historical source of the Gooniyandi verbal complex, in which the two elements,
the preverb and the auxiliary, have fused into a single free word. Changes have
led to a reanalysis of the verbal complex into root plus classifier.","[17, 18, 19, 20]"
"1.4 Gooniyandi culture and society
1.4.1 Traditional way of life
 Traditionally the Gooniyandi were hunters and gatherers. Like aU other
 Australian Aboriginal groups, they were restricted nomads (Maddock
 1972/1974:26), who moved in small foraging bands over relatively limited areas
within their tribal territory. Being an inland group, of course, the majority of
their foodstuffs came from the land; the numerous rivers, creeks and waterholes
were, however, also regularly exploited for the rich range of vegetable, reptile,
fish and crustacean resources that they provided.
      As in other Aboriginal groups there was a quite rigid division of labour
according to sex. Men did the majority of the hunting, especially for larger game
animals, reptiles, and birds such as kangaroos, crocodiles, echidnas, emus,
bustards, etc.. Women did the majority of the gathering of the staples: vegetable
foods such as yams, berries, grass seeds, water lily roots, and so on, as well as
small animals such as witchetty grubs and frogs, and animal products such as
honey. However, the women were also sometimes involved in the larger
operations of hunting kangaroos by fire; and smaller game, such as lizards,
goannas and fish, were caught by both men and women as opportunity arose.forms I gathered in Fitzroy Crossing.
                     GOONIYANDI CULTURE AND SOCIETY                              9Material culture was relatively simple. Men used a variety of different types of
spears and boomerangs for hunting and fighting; women used digging sticks for
gathering yams, stone axes for chopping honey from hollows in trees, and
coolamons (a type of dish) for carrying water, seeds, berries, babies and so on. In
addition, the tool kit included fire drills, fire saws and grinding stones.
Permanent dwellings were not made, but rough shelters were constructed from
spinifex and branches for occasional protection from the elements.
      The Gooniyandi had an intimate and detailed knowledge of their
environment, including its geography; the distribution of plant species and their
uses; and the seasons, and ripening times of various plant species. For instance,
some plants, and parts of plants, were known to have medicinal properties;
others were used as poisons (for example, one type of sap was used in small
waterholes to poison fish). The men in particular were excellent trackers, who
could identify animal species, and individual human beings by their tracks, an
ability which was of course crucial to their success as hunters (and later to the
success of white occupation- see McGregor 1988b).
      Although most everyday social interaction of the Gooniyandi would have
been within their group (or ""tribe""), there was also significant and important
interaction with other nearby groups, principally the Bunuba, Kija, Walmajarri,
and Nyikina peoples. This is evidenced by the high degree of multilingualism
among the older Gooniyandi; and quite likely inter-tribal marriages were not
uncommon. There is also, on Gooniyandi territory, an important waterho1e,
Jiliyardi, where inter-tribal ceremonies and corroborees were once held.
Furthermore, the Gooniyandi participated in - and still participate in, perhaps
to an even greater extent today, thanks to modern vehicles- an extensive
network of trade and exchange (Akerman 1979, Kolig 1981:126-127), which
they call wirnandi (wurnan in most other nearby languages). This took place in
two main streams of exchange. In a direct line through the major Aboriginal
communities of the southern Kimberley region, and in a westerly direction,
move myths, rituals, and body designs associated with the ""Woagaia"" (Kolig
1981:126) tradition. From the west Kimberley and Dampier Land, moving in
the opposite direction, come mainly material items, including large quantities of
shells (especially the highly coveted pearl shell) and shields. Thus many of the
songs and sacred myth cycles associated with important initiation ceremonies
presently ""owned"" by the Gooniyandi originated in the east, a fact which they
readily acknowledge. Many others have, within living memory, been passed on
to the west in exchange for goods.
      Writing was unknown in Aboriginal Australia. Inscribed message sticks
10                              lNTRODUCTIONwere used by the Gooniyandi to convey important information concerning
ceremonies and so on, but these attested more to the validity of the messenger
and his message than represented any particular text. Sand drawings are
occasionally used to illustrate spoken texts, but the system is not as well
developed, nor used as extensively as in the Centre (cf. Munn 1973). Various
hand signs were employed; these usually involved particular hand shapes,
together with movement. However, it seems that the repertoire of signs was
small by comparison with the desert peoples'. There were signs for common
animals, birds, and reptiles (at least those which were eaten), some basic actions,
affirmation and negation, and questions. Hand signs were presumably used when
verbal communication was not appropriate (e.g. in hunting), or suitable (e.g.
over a great distance). Hand signs are rarely used as adjuncts to spoken texts, and
there is no evidence that there was a well developed sign language such as is
found in Warlpiri (see Kendon 1978). Direction and location could be indicated
non-verbally by lip pointing, which may be concomitant with speech, giving
rise to phonetically lip-rounded vowels and consonants.
       The Gooniyandi traditionally practised various forms of bodily operations
on young males as rites of passage into manhood. These included circumcision
around puberty, and a few years later on, subincision; even later, horizontal
cicatrices were made across the chest, and a hole was made through the nasal
septum. Only the oldest living Gooniyandi men have undergone all of these riles
of passage; the majority of young adult and middle aged males have been
circumcised only, although some middle aged men do also have a few cicatrices.
The operations of circumcision and subincision were accompanied by a series of
 preparatory and follow-up stages and ceremonies. Prior to the operation of
 circumcision, the novice was taken on a trip to visit various relevant groups to
 formally invite them to the ceremony. The operation itself took place during a
 corroboree involving both men and women; today the main circumcision
 corroboree is the Waloongaddi (Walungarri in Walmajarri orthography).
Following their circumcision, the initiands were secluded in the bush for some
 months during which time they were permitted to engage in limited contact only
 with one another and the older men - usually a mother's brother- who looked
 after them. During this time, they also received ritual instruction; this was
 followed up later with further instruction, as the man went through later stages
 of initiation.
       There is an extensive mythology relating to events from a time in the
 distant past referred to in Gooniyandi and nearby languages by the term
 ngaddanggarni (ngarrangkarni in Walmajarri and Kija orthographies), and in the
                     GOONIYANDI CULTURE AND SOCIEIY                            11anthropological literature by the term ""dreamtime"". Aborigines in the region
also refer to this period as the dreamtime, although there seems to be no direct
connection with dreams. The myths explain the origin and names of
geographical formations, origins of animal species and social practices,
geographical location and land tenure of language groups, and so on. For
instance, Text 2 (see Appendix 1) is a myth about fire, which apparently
explains its social value, and also, perhaps, its usefulness (cf. Hodge and
McGregor forthcoming).
      Most Gooniyandi myths have a strong orientation to place. They typically
relate the travels of mythical beings over the countryside, from place to place,
and various events that happened along the way at these places, including, for
instance, ceremonies, conflicts with other mythical beings, and putting names to
the significant places. The more important myths - which are usually also
associated with important ceremonies, particularly initiation - refer to paths
which extend right across Gooniyandi country, and into neighbouring territories.
For instance, one very important kangaroo myth begins in the Napier Ranges,
and extends through Bunuba, Gooniyandi and Walmajarri countries, thence into
(and possibly through) Wangkajunga territory. Particular individuals have
ownership rights to parts of the macro-myth, namely the parts which intersect
their own land; and they usually know the outlines of the larger travels, but will
not relate them since they lack the rights to do so. Some myths (see e.g. Text
2), however, lack this place orientation; these are invariably of lesser
importance, and are never associated with significant ceremonial activities.
      Songs are both sacred and secular. They are sung to the accompaniment of
clapsticks; although the didgeridoo was known, it was not used in song. As
noted above, many songs originated in the east: this includes both sacred songs
associated with initiation ceremonies, and secular songs such as love songs (cf.
Akerman 1979:249). These usually (though not always) retain the language in
which they originated. For instance, the Gooniyandi repertoire includes love
songs in Gurindji, and songs from the Waloongaddi (Walungarri) cycle in
Wunambal. But there are also songs in the Gooniyandi language, including
traditional sacred songs associated with Gooniyandi mythology and land, and
secular songs invented- rather, dreamed- by Gooniyandi speakers.
       As in other Australian Aboriginal groups, the Gooniyandi observed a taboo
on uttering the name of a recently dead person (Nash and Simpson 1981, Dixon
 1980:28-29). This taboo extended to lexemes of a similar phonological shape,
and today, to varying extents, to a person's gardiya (white person) name also.
Reference to a recently dead person would usually be indirect - see, for
12                              INTRODUCTIONinstance, line (42) of Text 1. Whenever I revisit my Gooniyandi friends at
Fitzroy Crossing, one of the first things I am invariably told is who has died
since my last visit; this is presumably done in order to avoid the potentially
embarrassing situation of my mentioning that person's name. Reference is
usually made by uttering the person's gardiya name in a low whispering voice.
The taboo on the name of the dead person might last for a number of years (cf.
Dixon 1980:28), depending on the closeness of the relationship between the
speaker and the deceased: close relatives would observe the taboo for a much
longer period than others. Close relatives of the dead would observe, in addition
to the name taboo, a meat taboo, which could last for a considerable time, and
could only be broken by the enactment of a neutralising rite (cf. Hudson and
Richards 1978:44-45).
      There was a complex series of funerary rites according to which the bodies
of adults, both men and women, were disposed of (see McGregor forthcoming-a
for further details). The first stage involved putting the dead body on a platform
in a tree. Below the body were placed a number of rocks, each representing a
person potentially responsible for the death. The body would be left on the
platform for some months until it had begun to decompose, at which time an
inquest would be held. The rocks under the platform would be examined, and the
person responsible for the death identified: the rock representing that person
would be marked with the dripping exuviae of the dead body. Once the murderer
had been determined, the death could be avenged, either by sorcery or by a
specially set up avenging party. If no rock had been marked, the process might
be repeated; if (as in one case I was informed of) a number of repetitions still
failed to point to the murderer, it might be decided that no one was responsible,
and no avenging action taken. After the body had fully decomposed, and bones
only remained, it was usually finally disposed of either by burial, or by
placement in a small cave. Today, white institutions have control of the rites,
and the dead are given a Christian burial.","[21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"
"3.9.3.2.2 The pronominal configuration
First we will deal with the classifiers which occur with one pronominal prefix
only; these are: +I, +BINDI, +ANI, +ARNI2 , and +MARNI. Table 3-8 shows
the forms of the pronominal prefixes in the CC.
           Table 3-8: Pronominal prefixes to single-valent classifiers                  q                             nq

           3      fll                            +bidd+As this table shows, the first and second person singulars have two allomorphs,
one which is designated as occurring with set 1 classifiers, which include +I,
+ANI and +ARNI2 , the other with set 2 classifiers, +BINDI and MARNI. There
is a phonological correlate: the set 1 classifiers are vowel initial, while the set 2
classifiers are consonant initial. Examples:
204                                   1HEWORDSet 1:
      {ward       -ng     +I} --.\ /wardngi/      'I went'
         go        (lsg)N +I
      {ward       -ngg    +I} --.\ /wardginggi/      'you went'
         go        (2sg)N +I
(See VR7' for gi insertion.)
Set 2:
      {bam -li              +hindi} --.\ /bamloondi/      'I got back'
       return (lsg)N        +BIND!
      {bam        -ji  +bindi} --.\ /barnjoondi/          'you got back'
         return (2sg)N +BINDI
(See rule CCR9.)
      The only irregularity is that in the future tense the second person
pronominal is deleted in the case of classifiers +I and +BINDI. The set l prefix
+ngg+ of the second person does not occur in wardbiri 'you'll go'. (Note that it
is a quite common phenomenon across a broad spectrum of languages for
imperative forms to have no second person pronominal (and Gooniyandi does
not distinguish imperative from the future).)
      The table shows third person singular as having zero realisation. This is
clear in examples such as the following with set 2 classifiers:
      {bam        -¢      +hindi} --.\ /barnbindi/     'he returned'
         return    (3sg)N +BINDI
      (mird        -¢      +marni} --.\ /mirdmami/        'it's tied up'
       tie:up       (3sg)N +MARNI
       However, for set 1 classifiers matters are not quite as simple. Firstly, there
is an irregular form bilagini in the third person singular of +ARNI 2 , as in
widdij-bilagini (scratch-he:did:to:himselt) 'he scratched himself'. This form is
prefixed by the appropriate tense markers in a regular manner. It is so irregular
that I do not attempt to analyse it further or explain it. Secondly, for the
remaining two set 1 classifiers the actual forms in the past tense involve initial
consonants, as in e.g. ward-ji (go-he:was) 'he went', wara-yi (stand-he:was) 'he
stood', ngang-bani (die-he:fell) 'he died', bagi-wani (lie-he:fell) 'he lay down',
etc .. One reasonable way of accounting for this would be by a rule which inserts
a consonant before a CC with an initial vowel in underlying form. (The final
                              THE VERB PHRASE                                 205
qualification ''in underlying form"" is necessary because in certain cases the loss
of underlying (w} gives rise to a long vowel, and the CC has no initial
consonant in its phonemic realisation.) The consonant inserted in each case is
unexceptional: (j} preceding (i} and {b} preceding (a}. These lenite toy and w
respectively following vowels or [+continuants]. If this solution is adopted,
there is no problem in the present and future tenses, since they involve the
prefixes wi+ and bi+, and so consonant insertion is not required. There is one
exception, in the unexpected form -boowani in the future of the classifier +ANI
(e.g. gardboowani (fall-FUT+ANI) 'it will fall'), which has an inserted w. It
seems reasonable to suggest that thew is inserted because of pressure to keep
the past and the future forms distinct. The rules would otherwise derive from
underlying {gard-bi+ani} (fall-FUT+ANI) the form gardbani, which is
homophonous with the past tense form. This irregularity may be seen as further
evidence for the proposed rule of consonant insertion, rather than as
counterevidence - consonant insertion occurs to avoid homophony. I
tentatively adopt this solution in the present context A further advantage of this
solution is that it saves positing exceptional third person singular allomorphs
W and {b}, which would need to be deleted in the present and future tenses.
      There is complete regularity in the case of non-singular pronominals. The
rules involved in deriving the phonological forms are the following:(1) VR3 j   ~ y I# X {[[v~~~nantal]}-
                        +contmuant

+DI, +MI, +BINI, +ARNI 1 and +BIRLI- and one - +ADDI- is invariably
bivalent. In the following three tables, Tables 3-9A to 3-9C, I set out the
underlying forms for the two member pronominal configurations, which occur
regularly throughout the paradigm of each classifier, with the exception of a
small part of the future and present forms of +BINI (cf. page 199 above), which
show a number of irregularities. The exceptional present and future tense
pronominal paradigm for +BINI is explicitly left out of the following account; it
is described below in section 3.9.3.2.3. When monovalent, these classifiers
occur with pronominal prefixes containing a single member; the forms are
identical with the corresponding forms from the following tables with third
person singular Goal. (See section 5.2.1.3 for the terms Agent and Goal.)

of the CC in the past tense, which is realised by a zero prefix; in the other
tenses, initial ng,j, and bare lost by the sandhi rules as per 2.4.2.2. Secondly,
sandhi processes operating between the pronominal prefix configuration and the
following classifier may affect the shape of the final consonant of the
pronominal configuration, its vowel(s), or the initial consonant and the vowel(s)
of the classifier. Thus the underlying forms are obscured by sandhi processes,
and the segmentation proposed here is not the only one possible - though it
208                                 THE WORDdoes appear to be among the most economical. For example, in case the
classifier has an initial consonant, no posited final dd in any pronominal
configuration actually shows up in the phonemic representation. Conceivably
these forms might be treated as having no underlying dd. However, the
assumption that they do allows for a more general account involving less
allomorphy. and it also allows for an explanation of the phonological shapes by
fairly natural sandhi rules, which are required elsewhere, in any case.
       There are two irregularities, in which the predicted forms do not occur.
       (a) The first occurs when the second person singular acts on the third
person singular in the future tense, in which case the expected pronominal -ji
never occurs. An explanation for this is probably to be found in the general
cross-linguistic phenomenon mentioned earlier, whereby the second person
singular tends not to have overt realisations in imperatives.
       (b) The second irregularity occurs in the case of third person singular acting
on third person singular in the past tense of certain classifiers. Again the
problem seems to arise from the same source as the similar problem in the case
of the monovalent classifiers - that is, where (in underlying form) the CC is
predicted to be vowel initial. The predicted forms of (3sg) acting on (3sg) in the
past tense of the three vowel initial classifiers are identical with the classifier
itself, i.e. a, addi, and arni. But the forms that actually occur are -nga (for +A);
-baddi (for +ADDI), and -ngarni (for +ARNI). Again it seems reasonable to
regard the initial consonant as inserted for phonotactic reasons. (b) is expected,
as per above; but it is not clear why {ng) is inserted in the other two cases.
Furthermore, the sandhi rules predict that the (3sg)~(3sg) form of the classifier
+DI should be -i. Instead, the irregular form -jingi occurs. What is notable is
that these irregularities, however they are to be accounted for, occur in just those
cases in which the CC is vowel initial in some underlying form.
       It is obvious that further analysis of the forms is possible. I suggest here
one possible analysis, but do not attempt to justify it, or to show that it is the
best one possible.
       The majority (75%) of the forms can be accounted for in terms of a
sequence on two pronominals, one referring to the Agent, the other referring to
the Goal. Each pronominal comes in two case-forms: a NOM(inative), which
refers to the Agent; and an ACC(usative), which refers to the Goal. Some of the
case-forms have allomorphs. Table 3-10 sets out the forms, which account for
all bar the combinations involving a frrst and a second person actant.

        (3pl)      +bidd+ - +ri+        +bin+ - +ri+ - +hi+ - +bidd+The non-singular nominative pronominals are strikingly similar in shape to the
free forms:
                         +jidd+    ngidi, ngiddangi
                         +jadd+    yaadi, yaddangi
                         +nggidd+ gidi, giddangi
                         +bidd+    bidi, biddangi
Thus it is tempting to segment the non-singulars into invariant person markers
followed by number/case markers, dd for the NOM, and the corresponding nasal n
for the ACC ( cf. page 171 above).
     Where there is allomorphy, the choice is governed by the other pronominal
which the particular pronominal occurs with, and also by the classifier. The first
allomorph shown in Table 3-10 is the 'elsewhere' or unmarked form which
occurs most frequently throughout the paradigms. The second and third, where
given, are chosen as follows:
(i) +ngim+, the aliomorph of second person singular ACC occurs with all
classifiers when the other pronoun is third person plural, and in no other
circumstances.
(ii) The allomorph +ri+ of (3pl)NOM occurs with the classifiers +MI and +BINI
whenever the other pronominal is first person or plural (any person); +bidd+
occurs elsewhere. From Table 3-9 it would appear that this allomorph has an
invariant shape di; however, that it is underlyingly ri is evident from the fact
that when circumstances permit, the retroflection of its initial consonant
modifies an initial apical consonant in the following syllable, as per rules
CCR3 and CCR4. Example:
210                              'IHEWORD      {gard -bin     +ri      +bini} 'they hit them'
       hit (3pl)A (3pl)N +BINI
           ~ {gard-bin+rooni} (by CCR9)
           ~ {gardbindoomi} (by CCR3 and CCR4)
           ~ /gardboondoomi/ (by CCR16)(iii) For the third person plural accusative, the choice of allomorph is as
follows:
      +ri+, if the other pronoun is first or second person plural, and for +A.
           +ADDI, +ARNI1 and +MI classifiers;
      +hi+ in the same circumstances, for +BINI;
      +bidd+, in the same circumstances for +DI- the postulated final dd never
           shows up phonemically: it 'supports' the initial consonant of the
           classifier, preventing its elision; and
      +bin+ otherwise.
      Not only is the choice of allomorph conditioned by neighbouring
morphemes, but the order of the two pronominal prefixes is conditioned by their
relative status on a nominal hierarchy (cf. Silverstein 1976b, Heath 1976). Two
hierarchies explain the order of these pronominals:
                         Hl    first> second > third
                         H2    ACC>NOM
Here the symbol'>' indicates 'is ranked higher than'. and in the present context
indicates also morpheme order - i.e. > may also be interpreted as 'precedes'.
The second hierarchy, H2, of course, applies only if the first fails to order the
pronominals -which happens when both are third person.
      Eight forms from Tables 3-9A and 3-9C still remain to be accounted for;
these have both a first and a second person actant.
      Four of these can be dealt with fairly easily under the assumption of a
person-neutralising rule which has the effect of neutralising the person of the
lower ranking pronominal on Hl in case it is also outranked on H2. In other
words, if x acts on y and x is outranked by y in terms of person, only the
number of x is indicated, by the appropriate third person pronominal. This is
really only a complicated way of saying that, when second person acts on first
person, the number only of the second person is indicated by the corresponding
third person form. (In case the Agent is third person, neutralisation has, of
course, no effect.)
                              THE VERB PHRASE                                   211     The four remaining forms have a first person Agent acting on a second
person Goal. By analogy with the foregoing, the following segmentation is
suggested:
                   {a)   (Isg)-7(2sg):   +ng+iny+
                   (b)   (lsg)-7(2pl):   +ng+nggidd+iny+
                   (c)   (1R)-7(2sg):    +jidd+iny+
                   (d)   {1R)-7(2pl):    +jidd+iny+bidd+ ribi(dd)
      This proposal involves the identification of allomorphs +ng+ of the first
person singular NOM and +iny+ of the second person singular ACC (the Iauer
involves a final nasal of the same point of articulation as the (initial) consonant
of the corresponding NOM pronominal prefix). It would seem reasonable to
assume that the posited underlying geminate ng-ng of (b) would be reduced to
the single ng (geminate nasals do occur in the language, but not preceding
stops).
      However, (b) poses a second problem in that the ACC form of the second
plural does not occur; instead, there is the sequence of the second plural NOM
+nggidd+ followed by the second singular ACC +iny+. A similar problem
arises in relation to (d), where instead of the (2pl)A prefix, there occurs the
(2sg)A, the number being discontinuously marked by a (3pl)A form in final
position. But note that the choice of allomorphs of (3pl)A- +ri+ vs. +bidd+
-differs slightly from the choice elsewhere: +ri+ occurs with +A, +ADDI and
+ARNI 1; +bi+ with +MI and +BINI; and +bidd+ with +DI. I do not attempt to
explain the two exceptional forms (b) and (d); the proposed segmentation does,
however, appear to be reasonable.
   . Comparison of Table 3-8 with Table 3-10 shows that there is a good deal
of similarity between the pronominals that occur in monovalent complexes and
the NOM form of the pronominals occurring in bivalent complexes. The only
difference is that the second person singular set 1 form +ngg+ of Table 3-8 does
not appear in Table 3-10; its closest relative on the latter table is the accusative
form +nggi+. (Note: the first person singular +ng+ is not shown in Table 3-10,
but it has been subsequently discussed.) The evidence seems to justify regarding
the forms shown in Table 3-7 as NOM forms of the pronominal prefixes. For
convenience, all postulated forms are tabulated below in Table 3-11.

3.9.3.2.3     Irregularities in +BINI
In the following three tables I set out the paradigm of the CC for +BINI in the
future, future subjunctive, present, and present definite (omitting the tense
marker, since the tenses are formed regularly as per 3.9.3.2.4 and the sandhi
rules of section 2.4.2). (What is shown is not necessarily the complete
paradigm.)
Remarks on the tables:
(I) As mentioned earlier, there seems to be little regularity governing the choice
between the major allomorphs +bini and +boo. In some cases (such as
(1sg)~(2sg)) +bini occurs in the subjunctive and potential future, but not in the
unmodalised future or present. For example, the subjunctive future for
(lsg)~(2sg) with the verb gard- 'hit' is gardjawinybini 'I might hit you', but the
plain future is gardbinyboo 'I'll hit you'. The places where this is the
conditioning factor for the allomorph choice are indicated in the tables by
(SUBJ) next to the form. In other places (e.g. (lsg)~(3sg)) +bini occurs with
the future tense (irrespective of mood), while +boo occurs with the present. For
example, compare nyag(ja)woolooni 'I'll spear him', or 'I might spear him' with
nyaggoowaaloo 'I'm spearing you'. Elsewhere there appears to be no
allomorphy. There appears to be no regularity in the distribution of these three
possibilities.
(2) The vast majority of the pronominal configurations are formed regularly,
though different allomorphs are chosen depending on tense, mood, and on the
form of the classifier. Where +bini occurs, the pronominal allomorphs are those

indistinguishable from the corresponding form for third person singular Agent,

"3.9.1 Verbals
Verbals have already been def""med as those lexical (open-class) words which are
bound; all other lexical words have the privilege of free occurrence. Verbals have
just two contexts of occurrence: they occur either as constituents of finite VPs,
or as non-finite verbs. Although words of other classes may occur in the first
context, only verballexemes occur in the second. Furthennore, every verbal may
occur within a non-finite 'purposive' clause, in which construction it is followed
by the -woo allomorph of the dative postposition (see page 174 above)- e.g.
ward-goo (go-D AT) 'for going', bayal-woo (swim-DAT) 'for swimming'.
Another distinctive property of verbals is, as we have already seen, that, as a
class, they show phonotactic differences from the words of other lexical classes:
final consonants are permitted and frequent (section 2.2.5); there are statistically
significant differences in distribution of initial consonants in verbals compared
with other classes (section 2.2.5); and there is a high frequency of (closed)
monosyllables (section 2.3.1).
      I have been unable to distinguish subclasses within the class of verbals. In
particular, it is not possible to distinguish disjoint classes of transitive and
intransitive verbals (cf. Dixon 1980:378). Whereas in many Australian
languages transitivity may be regarded as a lexical feature of verbs (Dixon
 1980:278), in Gooniyandi transitivity has a clausal locus, and a single verbal
lexeme may occur in clauses of more than one transitivity type. Choice of
classifier may go some way towards distinguishing the transitivity of a VP -
for example, ward-ji (go-PAST/(3sg)N+I) 'he went' vs. ward-nga (go-
PAST/(3sg)N+A) 'he took it'. However, it proves equally impossible to
distinguish transitivity classes at phrase level as at word level (see sections
5.2.1.3 and 6.5.5 below).
       Verbals in Gooniyandi constitute a large open class of lexemes which refer
to all sorts of processes, including: states (e.g. wara- 'stand', bagi- 'lie'); changes
of state (e.g. nang- 'die'); motion, including induced motion (e.g. ward- 'go,
walk, bring'); violent actions (such as gard- 'hit, fell', bananggadd- 'snatch');
