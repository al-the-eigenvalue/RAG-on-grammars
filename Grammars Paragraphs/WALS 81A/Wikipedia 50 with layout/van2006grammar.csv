8.1.6 Word order and pragmatic status
As can be concluded from Tables 45, 48 and 49 above, the order of predicates and
their arguments in Yurakaré is fairly flexible. This is directly connected to the fact
that all grammatical relations are marked either on the verb or by postpositions on
the dependent noun phrase. This flexibility of word order makes it rather difficult
to come up with a basic word order.
  Nevertheless, overtly expressed subjects (both S and A 8) seem to have a clear
preference for the postverbal position. Occurrences of preverbal subjects can often
be explained in terms of special pragmatic status, whereas overtly expressed
pragmatically neutral subjects are generally found in postverbal position.
Preverbal subjects are almost invariably emphatic topics, though not every
marked topic ends up before the verb. Givón (2001b:253‐269) mentions a number
of cross‐linguistically found marked topics and discusses the morphosyntax
associated with these. What Givón calls ‘existential‐presentative constructions’,
8I take A here to mean subjects of all two‐ and three‐place predicates, including extended
intransitives and extended transitives.",[293]

A grammar of Yurakaré
Predicates with a valence of one can be divided into intransitive verbs and non‐
verbal predicates. These two categories are not formally distinct. Still, I consider
them to be separate categories, since with regard to non‐verbal predications, it is
often difficult to say what is the word order exactly, VS or SV. This is because it is
not always clear which of the two elements is the predicate and which the
argument, hence the high percentage of unanalyzable non‐verbal predicates in
Table 45. As Payne (1997:83) says: “(…) the probability of mistakenly including
predicate nominals in a study of constituent order is quite high (especially if the
language uses a zero copula element in predicate nominals).” Predicates with a
valency of two can be divided into inherently transitive and derived transitive
predicates, or extended intransitives. It is useful to distinguish these two, since, as
will become apparent below, they behave differently in some respects.
  In the remainder of this section I will discuss the types of predicates mentioned
in Table 45: intransitive verbs (8.1.1), transitive verbs (8.1.3), extended intransitive
verbs (8.1.4), ditransitive verbs (8.1.5), and non‐verbal predicates (8.1.2). In 8.1.6, I
will discuss word order from an overall perspective; in 8.1.7, finally I will briefly
discuss interrogative and negative sentences.","[282, 283]"

             ‘He was the one who cut him with a stone and with wax and an ax!’ (OR‐19MA‐9)This text fragment, consisting of sequential utterances, is taken from a narrative in
which the speaker mixes up the main characters of the story and then finds out
about her mistake. She then continues to set things straight by explicitly stating
the roles that the main characters have. The subjects of (22)d‐f are pre‐verbal and
in contrastive focus.
  In general, then, we can say that VS is the pragmatically more neutral order;
preposing a subject gives some kind of emphasis to it. The fact that the pre‐verbal
position is pragmatically marked is corroborated by the fact that question words
are always sentence‐initial, regardless of their semantic or syntactic role (more
discussion on questions in the next section):(23) a       të‐pshë         li‐tütü‐ø     na     ashaa=chi              (subject)

             ‘Who are you washing for?’ [VL‐24MA‐13]  As far as the position of objects is concerned, no clear preference for pre‐ or
postverbal position can be given in terms of frequency. Preverbal and postverbal
objects (O as well as E) occur in about equal proportions.
  Typological research in the past decades has revealed some rather strong
correlations between sentence word order and the order of words in other
constructions. In Table 50 I give Greenberg’s (1963) list, taken from Payne
(1997:72):

Table 50 shows that Yurakaré has a slight tendency to correlate with the O‐V type.
Nevertheless, these correlations are not very convincing and can never be
evidence in themselves for a basic order.
  Generally, preverbal objects are pragmatically marked as well:(24) a      bëshë yurujare‐tu         bëshë     a‐mumuy bëshë         kamba‐tu         ma‐mmuy

            ‘All of that our chief Tiri transformed before.’ (both: OR‐19MA‐20)In (24), the narrator is telling about the mythological ancestor of the Yurakaré, Tiri,
who used his magic to transform into jungle animals all kinds of objects and
creatures that he encountered during his wandering, so that the Yurakaré would
have meat. In the second line, the object ati amumuy is preposed, because it is a
marked topic, with a deictic function, referring back to the topic of the previous
sentence.
  In the following fragment, the object is emphasized (stressed) and fronted in the
final sentence of the example:

      ‘Let’s make her chuchio, ehh jisopo and burn it first.’ (FL&DV‐14MA‐1)Generally, it seems that marked objects are found in initial position. Postverbal
objects can also refer to new and unpredictable information, but objects with extra
emphasis (focus), whether direct or applied, are found in preverbal position. The
fact that applied objects have a slight preference for being postverbal can be
explained by the fact that they are usually very topical (cf. Van Gijn 2005).
  The emphatic function of the preverbal position can also be seen in examples
such as the following, where the object NP is discontinuous (cf. section 4.1), the
modifier being in preverbal position, while the head noun is in postverbal
position:(26) lëshie=w ma‐bëjta‐y       shunñe=w
     two=PL      3PL‐see‐1SG.S man=PL
     ‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]This construction gives emphasis to the quantifier, while the head noun is
presented as a specification, or afterthought, possibly but not necessarily after a
pause. The quantifier is also stressed.
 Not very often both object and subject are overtly expressed. In the instances
where this was the case, I have encountered four word orders in texts:
                                           283

           ‘Aysa was looking for sabalo.’ (OR‐19MA‐11)I have found no instances of SOV or OSV. The reason that these are rare seems to
be connected to the tendency in the Yurakaré main clause for the verb to be
preceded by only one constituent. In analyzing the first 85 clauses of a text, I have
encountered only three instances where the verb was not in second or first place in
the clause. All kinds of constituents can precede the verb. In (27)a two ideophonic
particles precede the verb; in (27)b and c, two elements precede the verb. Consider
(28), where some other elements that can precede the verb are given:(28) a     ta‐dyuluta=la danda‐tu     tuwa               (PP‐phrase)

           ‘They were standing there red (ripe).’ (AY‐3NC‐7)In almost all of the sentences that I examined in two texts, the verb was in either
initial or second position, preceded by all kinds of elements. In some instances, the
verb is in third place. This is also the case in the examples in (27)b and c. In these
circumstances, the first element is always a kind of setting marker, like latijsha
‘then’ pënchi ‘later’ ati ‘there’. These are elements that have a scope which is on the
level of the proposition. Subordinated clauses are also often in this position, often,
like setting words (adverbial elements setting the stage for a main event), marked
by an intonation break:(29) ati   shuju‐ø=ja an=chi woroj~wo‐ø=ya            latiji         ana a‐jorejto=chi

                                           284
The clause
If these subordinated sentences are not at the beginning of a proposition, they are
at the very end:(30) kwarenta dia kwarenta noche mashi‐ø=ja tom               wita‐ø     ashaa=chi

     ‘After raining 40 days and 40 nights, the water level had reached the sky when it
     took Noah’s boat’ (OR‐20MA‐1)Subordinated clauses marked by the enclitics =ja (cf. 8.2.3) and =ti (8.2.4) have a
different internal word‐order, generally. Overtly expressed arguments mostly
precede the predicate in these types of clauses:(31) na     ishete buybu ka‐n‐dyuju‐ø=ti lash         achama      lëtta    dia nish
      DEM   agouti word 3SG‐IO‐tell‐3=DS      then be.like.that one        day NEG
      wita‐ø=ya
      arrive.SG‐3=NVR
      ‘When the agouti told him the news, he did not come home for a day.’ (AR‐8MI‐49)Nevertheless, sometimes elements that belong to the subordinated clause can
appear to the right of the subordinating enclitic =ja (or =ti):(32) ku‐benemne‐ø              latiji          na   ta‐ppë           tiri bëjta‐ø=ja

     na      ishete     tejte
     DEM     agouti grandmother
     ‘Then Tiri felt sorry for the old agouti when he saw her.’ (AR‐8MI‐47)Leaving aside subordinated clauses, the data suggest that Yurakaré main clause
structure is V‐initial, with two positions before the verb, one position for setting
words, followed by an emphasis position, then followed by the verb. If we look at
how the elements after the verb are ordered, there is not a clear pattern, but
generally the most topical, known information is found rightmost. Adverbs and
adjuncts can intervene; adverbs related to the event are generally adjacent to the
verb, either to the left or to the right (cf. section 6.5.9 above). The following is a
continuous text fragment from the beginning of a text:

         ‘He carried with him a very small basket, this Pëpësu.’ (AY‐3NC‐6)Clause (33)a of the fragment is an existential‐presentative construction. The
subject, as expected, is in postverbal position. The adverb shinama generally
appears right after the verb. In (33)b the main new information in the form of an
adjunct is postverbal. The same adjunct in (33)c is the final element and old
information. The new information is the combination pëpëshamaw lacha, which
comes before the old information. In (33)d, the subordinate clause is preposed,
followed by a setting‐word latijsha and a preverbal subject with an extra emphasis
marker =ja introduces a new topic. In (33)e, finally, the emphasized element
anajalima is taken out of the object NP and positioned in the preverbal position.
The new object awerta comes right after the predicate, while the old information na
pëpësu is the final element. The template of the main clause, then, roughly looks as
in (34). Note that these are not absolute positions, but rather tendencies in the
clause.(34) (setting), emphasis, VP (pred. + adverbs), new information, topic, afterthought8.1.7 Negative and interrogative clauses
Negative clauses are marked by the negative adverb nish, with phonetic variant nij
(to negate a predicate or VP) or by the form nij‐ta (NEG‐MID; existential negation).
Nish/nij normally immediately precedes the predicate it negates:10Aysa and Pëpësu are two characters that are closely connected in this story in which they
work together. The reason the narrator started the story with Aysa is probably because I
asked him to tell the story of Aysa.","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301]"
"
4.2 Number
Number in Yurakaré has two basic values: singular and plural. Singular is unmarked,
while plural is normally marked by the enclitic =w, which minimally appears on the
last element of the NP:
3 Discontinuous NPs are a frequently observed feature in languages with a flexible word order
(Givón 2001‐II:13).
4 I consider this construction to be an applicative construction with a comitative object, cf.section 5.2.1.",[108]
"We have already seen the ordering of applicative prefixes and cross‐referencing
prefixes in (5). As an illustration of the suffixal order, consider the following
utterance:(7)   mëë          mala‐m=ti        chili‐ta‐shta‐ø          mi‐tewi      mi‐marka
      2SG.PRN      go.SG‐2SG.S=DS clean‐MID‐FUT‐2SG.S        2SG‐foot:LOC 2SG‐mark
      ‘If you go, the mark on your foot will rub off.’ (OR‐19MA‐31)Here we can see that the middle voice marker precedes the future marker in the
verb chilitashta.
  The distinction between inflection and derivation is relevant in that it explains
many of the ordering of morphemes. Derivational elements are generally closer to
the root than inflectional elements, a tendency observed to be generally true for
most languages (cf. Bybee 1985). The verbal template is characterized by the
following linear order of morphemes:(8)   inflection‐derivation‐root‐derivation‐inflectionThe more clearly derivational a morpheme, the closer it is to the root, generally.
Inflectional order is TMA suffixes before cross‐referencing suffixes.
  There is also a system of verbal enclitics, which mainly have a modal (epistemic)
or aspectual meaning, and in addition a small set of clausal enclitics, which can
attach to any phrase‐final word. These clause‐final elements often have to do with
emphasis and speaker commitment.",[26]
"                                              11
A grammar of Yurakaré
  Word order is relatively free. Overtly expressed subjects most frequently appear
in postverbal position; objects occur on both sides of the verb with about equal
frequency. Adverbs are relatively free in their position; different adverbs have
different preferences.
  Complex clauses are often marked by one of three clause‐chaining enclitics
marking that the subject expressed in the verb they attach to is either the same or
different from the subject of the last verb in the string of predicates. There are two
enclitics indicating ‘same subject’, depending on the factual status of the
subordinated predicate: =ya for irrealis, =ja for realis.","[26, 27]"
"8.1 The simple clause
In (1), there are three participants on stage, the addressee (subject), the wound (it),
and the beneficiary (her). None of these three participants is expressed overtly:(1)    tishi ka‐n‐tëptë‐cha‐m         konsono
       now 3SG‐IO‐wash‐JUS‐2SG.S      well
       ‘Now wash it [wound] well for her.’ (FL‐14MA‐1)In fact, text analyses show that objects and subjects are overtly expressed in only
25.6% (objects 1) and 28.1% (subjects) of all clauses. Table 45 below shows how
different types of predicates behave in terms of the (non‐)expression of arguments.
It also shows the word order of predicates and arguments when the latter are
overtly expressed. I looked at five texts: three mythological narratives, one
explanatory text and one conversation. I counted the number of instances where
the subject was not expressed (Vs), and the subject was overtly expressed;
furthermore, I counted the number of instances where it was expressed after the

5.    Verbal agreement, voice and valencyGrammatical relations in Yurakaré are mainly marked through verbal cross‐
referencing. Word order does not play a role in identifying grammatical relations, and
dependent marking (postpositions ‐ cf. section 4.3) is used mainly to mark peripheral
participants. Subjects and objects are marked on the verb; subjects are suffixes and
objects are prefixes. In addition to this, Yurakaré has an elaborate system of
applicatives, as well as a middle marker and a causative construction to modify the
valency of a verb. In this chapter I will discuss transitivity, valency and the encoding of
subjects and direct objects on the verb (5.1), applicatives (5.2), and voice (5.3).","[156, 157, 158]"

(3)     ati‐jti=ja        ta‐buybu      tuwa
        DEM‐LIM=EMPH      1PL‐language 1PL.PRN
        ‘That is our language.’ (OR‐20MA‐5)Adjectives can either precede or follow the head noun. There seems to be no semantic
distinction connected to the different orders. The normal case, however, is that
adjectives are used as predicates, a point also observed by Day (1980). It is often hard
to decide whether a semantically modifying element is used as a predicate or a
dependent adjective, since there is partial overlap in morphology (cf. section 3.3).
Nevertheless, examples like (4) show that within the NP, there are two possible
positions for the adjective.(4)     shuyulë     yee=w  ~           yee   shuyulë=w
        beautiful woman=PL
        ‘beautiful women’Plurality is generally marked once for every NP. The number clitic appears on the final
element of the NP. The fact that the adjective and the noun ‘share’ a number marker (a
phrasal enclitic) suggests that they are within one and the same NP. Nevertheless, the
number enclitic is not exemplary for a phrasal enclitic, since it is often expressed on the
noun as well as the adjective, especially with the order NA. I will come back to this
point below (4.2).
  Another set of enclitics are the postpositions marking the relationship of the NP to its
head. These postpositions follow the position of the plural enclitic. There is only one
slot for postpositions; there are no instances of a combination of two or more
postpositions on one NP. An example of such a postposition is the comitative marker is
given in (5):(5)     … a‐bonto=w=tina
           3SG.P‐son=PL=COM
        ‘…with his sons’ (AR‐8MI‐64)As far as relation‐marking strategies are concerned, dependent‐marking strategies
compete with head‐marking strategies where the relationship between the verb and its
dependent NPs is encoded on the verb. This has to do with topicality and animacy.
Animate topical participants are more likely cross referenced on the verb, e.g. by
means of applicative constructions, non‐topical, inanimate participants are more likely
to be marked by means of a postposition (cf. Van Gijn 2005) 2. Postpositions will be
discussed in 4.3; head marking of grammatical relations will be the topic of sections 5.1
and 5.22
    Some relations, such as subject and direct object, are always marked on the verb.","[106, 107]"
"
3.2.2 Suffixing, prefixing, and infixing
As mentioned, Yurakaré has both prefixes and suffixes. The categories associated
with prefixes and suffixes are roughly as follows:                         Table 12 ‐ categories of prefixes and objects
                    prefixes                       suffixes
                    object cross‐reference         subject cross‐reference
                    object‐oriented valency        subject‐oriented valency
                    aspect                         tense, mood, aspect
                    derivation                     derivation
The order of bound morphemes is fixed in Yurakaré, corresponding to their scope,
as well as to the distinction between derivation and inflection. By derivational
morphemes I mean morphemes that “form new words either by changing the
meaning of the base to which they are attached (…) or by changing the word‐class
that a base belongs to” (Katamba 1993:47). “Inflectional morphemes are only able
to modify the form of a word so that it can fit in a particular syntactic slot”
(Katamba 1993:51).
  In the following examples, we can see that inflection is generally found more
towards the edge of a word, while derivation is closer to the root. Consider first:                                                  51
A grammar of Yurakaré
(14) a    ana‐kka‐ø=ti       ka‐l‐i‐sibë‐ø
          DEM‐MEA‐3=DS       3SG‐AFO‐VBL‐house‐3
          ‘When he was this big, she made him a house.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)
      b   tütü‐mashi‐ø=w=ya
          sit‐LD‐3=PL=NVR
          ‘They stayed a little.’ (AR‐8MI‐60)In (14)a, there are several derivational affixes. On the demonstrative pronoun ana,
there is a derivational element deriving a measure ‘this size’. This derivation also
changes the word class, turning it into an adjectival element, used as a predicate
here. The derivational element is followed by a zero morpheme. I will argue for
the existence of this zero morpheme in section 3.2.5 below. In the same section, I
will discuss enclitics, of which =ti is an example. The second (main) predicate in
(14)a has its cross‐referencing object morpheme ka‐ leftmost, more towards the
verb root, we find the derivational elements l‐ (shortened form of la‐) ‘affected
object’‐applicative and i‐ ‘verbalizer’. The prefix la‐ (or l‐ before a vowel) is an
applicative prefix which increases the valence of a verb, which, in this case, has the
role of beneficiary. The prefix i‐ is a category‐changing prefix, deriving verbs from
nouns. In (14)b, the verb root is followed by a derivational element ‐mashi, which
indicates that the event is carried out to a limited degree (a little), followed by the
subject marker ‐ø and the plural morpheme =w.
  As far as tense, mood and aspect are concerned, the order seems to follow the
relevance principle (Bybee 1985), which says that an affix is placed closer to the
root the more relevant it is to the meaning of the root from a cognitive point of
view.
  The only tense marker ‐shta ‘future tense’ is found before the subject markers, as
is event‐related modality and aspect 5. Modality and aspect that is more
propositional related (epistemic) or related to expressive and interactional motives
of the speaker are external to the person markers (cf. sections 7.1 and 7.2)
  Infixing is a marginal process in Yurakaré. A first possible example of this is a
variant of the imperative singular (cf. section 6.3.5) marker <‐n‐> (with allomorph
[m]) with verbs that start with the vowel /i/. Examples of infixing of this type often
involve roots that seem to be complex in one way or another; hence we may not be
dealing with infixing after all:
5The only prefixed aspectual markers a‐ ‘incompletive and i‐ ‘verbal plural’ either replace
object prefixes (in the case of incompletive a‐) or they merge with the object markers (in the
case of verbal plural i‐).","[66, 67]"
"Finally, I would like to thank Daniëlle Arets for her love, tolerance and support.

1.    IntroductionThe Yurakaré Indians form a small indigenous group that lives in the foothill area
of central Bolivia. Their language, Yurakaré, is one of the many languages in an
area that is a complicated puzzle of seemingly unrelated languages. The objective
of this book is to give a grammatical description of the Yurakaré language.
  The study of South‐American languages has seen a big increase in research
efforts at the beginning of the millenium. Looking at the situation in the Yurakaré
area alone, a number of complete grammars have appeared in the years preceding
the appearance of this grammar: Latundê/Lakondê (Telles 2002), Moré (Angenot
2002), Sabanê (Antunes 2004), Kanoê (Bacelar 2004), Kwaza (Van der Voort 2004),
Cavineña (Guillaume 2004), Mosetén (Sakel 2004) and Yuki (Villafañe 2004). Apart
from these a number of grammatical descriptions are in preparation: Sararé
(Borella in prep.), Araona (Emkow in prep.), Movima (Haude in prep.), Baure
(Danielsen in prep.), Itonama (Crevels in prep.), Arikapu (Van der Voort in prep.),
Leko (Van de Kerke in prep.), Maropa (Guillaume in prep.), and Uru (Hanss in
prep.). Finally, two important language surveys of major areas in South America
have appeared: Dixon & Aikhenvald (1999) on Amazonian languages, and
Adelaar with Muysken (2004) on Andean languages.
  It is in this growing tradition of study of the languages of South America that
this grammar appears. It is the ideal situation in the sense that it can maximally
profit from and contribute to the growing body of material.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

Morphology
prefixes, which trigger the loss of the geminate consonant in the root, whereas the
proclitics do not:(45) an yarru    ‘this chicha’
     ti‐yaru     ‘my chicha’There is also a distributional argument to distinguish clitics from independent
words: the positional possibilities of clitics are generally more restricted than those
of independent words. For instance, if we look at the different possibilities in the
internal word order of the noun phrase consisting of the three elements matata
‘big’, yee ‘woman’, and ja ‘emphatic subject’ we can see the distinction between
words and clitics:(46) a   matata yee=ja     ‘big woman’
     b   yee matata=ja
     c   *ja matata yeeThe morphemes matata and yee can both appear as the first element of the noun
phrase, but the element ja cannot. In fact, this element attaches to the final element
of the noun phrase. The order yee=ja matata or matata=ja yee is allowed, but this can
be explained by the fact that nouns and adjectives can function as predicates and
adjectives can function as heads of noun phrases as well (cf. section 3.3). The
analysis of these two noun phrases would be:(47) a   [yee]NP=ja    [matata]PRED
     b   [matata]NP=ja [yee]PREDFinally, many clitics are monosyllabic or even non‐syllabic, while there is
independent phonological evidence that independent words are required to
minimally have two syllables (cf. section 2.4.6).
Clitics can be distinguished from affixes on the basis of one or more of the
following criteria. First, some of the clitics have more combinatory possibilities
than affixes with regard to the host they attach to. For instance, the plural enclitic
=w can attach to either nouns or adjectives, while the collective marker ‐ima can
only attach to adjectives and the possessive prefixes attach to nouns only. Second,
affixes generally cannot attach to clitics, whereas clitics can (cf. Zwicky & Pullum
1983:504). Finally, affixes are always taken into account with regard to stress
placement; in Yurakaré, most clitics are as well, but some clitics are not.
Clitics in Yurakaré can be classified with respect to each other as well. There are
three classes of clitics which can be distinguished on the basis of the following
criteria.","[77, 78]"

24 Palmer (2001:22) mentions that habitual past may be marked as irrealis in the languages
of the world, though it is not very common.
25 Note that the combination of a future event and a ya‐type subordination does notautomatically lead to a purposive interpretation. As can be seen in (64)c, these
constructions can also get the interpretation of a ‘before’‐clause. Note also that in this case
the order of the predicates is not iconically motivated.",[317]

Phonology
Other examples are to ‘bone’, ye ‘woman, sister’, pü ‘road’. I consider these nouns
to be underlyingly monosyllabic; in order to avoid a stressed final syllable, the
final vowel is copied. The double vowels are optionally separated by a glottal
stop. In example (73)b, the vowel is still copied, even though the prefixation of ti‐
makes the underlying word disyllabic. This is because the prefix ti‐, as explained
above, is stress‐avoiding. The available vowel copying is used for this purpose.
  However, there are at least two monosyllabic nouns that do not allow this vowel
copying. These nouns never occur in citation form, they are always possessed:(74) tí‐nñu    ‘my suckling’
     tí‐bba    ‘my husband’As can be seen, the normally unstressed first person singular possessive is stressed
here. Apparently, with these roots, the constraint that prohibits stress‐avoiding
syllables to be stressed is violated rather than adding a vowel. Apart from
stressing this light prefix there is a geminated consonant in both words, just like
the roots with a stress‐avoiding syllable in them: in order to license stress on the
light syllable, it is made heavy by geminating the following consonant.","[59, 60]"

As far as valency is concerned, there are three basic types of predicates in
Yurakaré: one‐place predicates, two‐place predicates and three‐place predicates.
In Table 45, however, I distinguish five types of predicates rather than three.",[282]

4.1 Introduction
In this section I will make some general remarks on the structure and composition of
the NP in Yurakaré, with special reference to the order of words within the NP.
The template of the Noun Phrase in Yurakaré is as follows 1:                QN
(1)   [DEM              A   POSS    N   (POSS)     A ] =PL=POSTP     (REL CLAUSE)
                NUM
Noun phrases are headed by a noun, the element that determines the syntactic function
of the whole phrase (cf. Payne 1997:31). Nouns can be modified by adjectives,
quantifiers, numerals, possessor phrases or adjectivally used demonstratives.
Demonstratives, quantifiers and numerals always precede the noun they modify. All
three can be used independently as well, forming an elliptic NP of their own. Numerals
and quantifiers are mutually exclusive in one and the same NP for semantic reasons.
Demonstratives and quantifiers do co‐occur:(2)   ati      lëtta yee
      DEM      one   woman
      ‘this one woman’ (AR‐8MI‐3)Possessors are cross‐referenced on the possessed noun. Since they are cross‐referenced,
the overt expression of the possessor NP is not obligatory. When expressed, possessors
in the vast majority of cases precede the possessed noun. It is not prohibited however,
for the possessor to follow the possessed noun:1I am leaving relative clauses out of the discussion in this chapter; they will be treated below in
section 8.2.",[106]

                                            9
A grammar of Yurakaré
  The noun phrase normally consists of a noun and optionally has modifying
elements as well (possessors, adjectives, numerals, quantifiers and articles).
Numerals, quantifiers and articles precede the noun; adjectives, as exemplified in
example (4) below, and possessors can be on either side of the head noun.
Modifiers can furthermore be extracted from the noun phrase:(2)   bëmë          wojto‐ø       ti‐tëbë
      much/many     pour.out‐3 1SG‐blood
      ‘Much of my blood is pouring out.’ [AA‐9MA‐6]Possession is marked on the head by means of a cross‐referencing personal prefix,
as can be observed in example (2) above. The noun marked for possession is
usually preceded (but it may also be followed) by the possessor noun phrase:(3)   shunñe a‐pojore
      man      3SG.P‐canoe
      ‘the man’s canoe’Number and case relations are marked by means of postpositional enclitics, which
attach to the rightmost element of the noun phrase. The postpositions marking
case relations mark the more peripheral relations: comitative, instrument, location,
direction and ablative. There is also a postpositional enclitic marking an emphatic
subject. All of this is exemplified in (4). Here it can also be observed that the clitic
status of the plural marker is somewhat doubtful, as it can appear optionally and
in addition to marking the final element, on non‐final elements as well.(4)   a   yee=ja             awissmë‐ø   shunñe  ewete(=w)     matat‐ima=w=la
          woman=EMPH         club‐3      man     broom(=PL)    big‐COL=PL=INS
      b   yee=ja             awissmë‐ø   shunñe  matat‐ima(=w) ewete=w=la
                                                 big‐COL(=PL) broom=PL=INS
          ‘The woman clubs the man with a big broom.’ (GB‐1MI‐99)Yurakaré is an accusative language, with some ergative characteristics, restricted
to a very small number of verbs. Subjects are suffixed to the verb, objects are
prefixed. Yurakaré predicate roots are either intransitive or transitive. These basic
valencies can be extended to maximally three head‐marked arguments with the
help of an elaborated system of five different applicatives (comitative, co‐
operative, objective, indirect object and affected object). Examples of such verb
roots with extended valency are the following:
                                           10
Introduction
(5)   a   ti‐ma‐n‐kaya‐ma
          1SG‐3PL‐IO‐give‐IMP.SG
          ‘Give them to me!’
      b   ti‐ma‐la‐che‐m
          1SG‐3PL‐AFO‐eat‐2SG.S
          ‘You ate them from me.’The entities referred to by the cross‐reference affixes in (5) may additionally be
expressed by overt noun phrases, but this is not required. The utterances in (5) are
perfectly grammatical sentences. Yurakaré, in other words, is a pro‐drop
language.
  Many temporal, modal and aspectual distinctions are marked by means of
suffixes, which come right after valency changing morphology (the middle voice
marker and causative, which are suffixed), but before the person markers. This
taken together with the object cross‐referencing prefixes and applicative markers
discussed above complete the template of the Yurakaré verb:(6)   object cross ref. ‐ applicatives ‐ root ‐ valency ‐ TMA ‐ subject cross ref.","[24, 25, 26]"

4.4.1 Possession
Attributive possession is marked on nouns only. It involves a relation between two
nouns. A person prefix is added to the head noun; the dependent noun is not marked.
The possessive prefixes constitute a paradigm which shows some formal similarities                                          115

The sound /t/ in the first person possessive marker can be explained by the fact that the
free pronoun sëë is pronounced [tsQQ], with a slight [t] in the onset. The third person
singular and the plural are not transparently related. As for the prefix a‐ for third
person singular possessive, we can say that the vowel /a/ is present throughout the
demonstrative paradigm, and may have a deictic meaning. The prefix ma‐ may be
related to the word mumuy or mumay, which means ‘all’. The possession paradigm is
also identical to the object paradigm formally, the third person singular being the
exception.
  The possessive prefix is obligatory 18, there are one or two instances where the
possessor prefix is absent, but these can be considered exceptions. The possessor is
often lexically expressed, but this is not obligatory. When expressed, the possessor can
occur either before or after the head noun; the order possessor‐possessed is most often
encountered, however:(76) a      shunñe a‐sibë
            man      3SG.P‐house

            ‘our deceased ancestor’s pots’   (AR‐8MI‐16)Example (76)c also shows the recursive possibilities of possession marking, where a
possessed noun (tappëshamaw ‘our grandfathers’) can in turn be a possessor (of
maoshewow ‘their pots’). Possessed nouns can be modified by e.g. adjectives and
numerals:18   With the exception of compounded possessive relations.","[130, 131]"

scepticism, strong doubt or even disagreement. In (74)a, the speakers (who are
jaguars) see a number of dead birds lying around, and they cannot believe that
their mother has killed them by herself. They strongly suspect that she did not kill
the human child they gave to her in order for her to kill and eat it. In (74)b, the
speaker gets the message that the family he lives with is not his family after all, a
statement he disagrees with.=jtë ‘speculative’ + =ya ‘non‐veridical’I have found one example of the above combination. In this example, =jtë preceeds
=ya:(75) ama‐shku       ibëbë‐shti=jtë=yu          ibëbë=jtë=ya            ta‐mme=yu

     ‘What should I do to our mother?’ (OR‐19MA‐30)In (75) the verb is repeated with the non‐veridical marker (for this construction cf.
7.1.1 and 8.2.2) and interestingly, the speculative marker is still on the repeated
verb, and comes before the non‐veridical marker. Normally, the repeated verb
would be devoid of any TMA marker and person marking. In this case, there is no
person marker on the repeated verb, but the speculative marker is still there.
  These are the combinations of epistemic modality that I have found. I did not
encounter combinations of the enclitics =bala ‘admonitive’ and =tiba ‘assumptive’
with other epistemic enclitics. Once again, it must be stressed that this does not
entail that combinations of this kind are impossible.
  With the above examples of combinatory possibilities we can come up with the
following tentative template:                  Table 43 - Combinatory possibilities of epistemic modals

Static templates such as the one in Table 43 may be inferior to more principled
accounts for morpheme orders (cf. Muysken 1986), but it is a good start for the
study of morpheme order and interpretation.","[276, 277, 278]"

8.1.3 Transitive verbs
As far as subjects of the transitive verb (A) are concerned, we see that they are left
unexpressed much more often than intransitive subjects (S), cf. 8.1.1 above. The
fact that overtly expressed noun phrases appear more freely in intransitive subject
or direct object roles (O) than in transitive subject role is a universal tendency,
which “is evidenced widely in the spontaneous discourse of virtually all
languages investigated to date” (Du Bois 2003:48). This phenomenon has to do
with the fact that new information is typically expressed in either intransitive
subject or transitive object role, positions more salient than the transitive subject
position.
  As far as the position of overtly expressed subjects is concerned, there is a slight
tendency for A to favor the postverbal position. Nevertheless, this preference is
much weaker than in intransitive verbs, where 85.3% of all overtly expressed S‐
arguments is realized in post‐verbal position, whereas only 55.8% of all overt A‐
arguments of inherently transitive verbs is expressed post‐verbally. This
difference can possibly be attributed to the emphatic function of the preverbal
position, as will be discussed in section 8.1.6.
  The percentage of direct objects left unexpressed (58.4%) is comparable to the
percentage of non‐expressed S‐arguments (62.5%) in intransitives. This fact seems
to support the claim that, as far as information‐structure goes, the S‐position and
the O‐position have similar functions: they are equally equipped for introducing
new linguistic material.
  The position of overt O’s is rather unpredictable, in the sense that there does not
seem to be a clear preference for either preverbal or postverbal O’s. I will discuss
this matter in section 8.1.6.",[290]

Class I clitics can be found in the domains of pronouns, conjunctions and adverbs.
Examples are the reduced forms of the demonstratives ana, ati and naa: an, a(t),
and na, respectively:(48) a   an=ta‐buy          tiri ta‐ma‐n‐dula‐ø=ti
         DEM=1PL‐chief      Tiri 1PL‐3PL‐IO‐make‐3=DS

         IDEO      go.SG‐3 DEM=mouth‐MID
         ‘“Bang”, the door went.’ (OR‐20MA‐1)We find the reduced forms of the demonstratives attached to other hosts as well:(49) a   na=tuwa‐wa‐shku‐ta                tuwa         ta‐buybu=la

         NEG     3PL.CO‐light.up‐3=PL=DEM        subsequently 3SG.P‐arrow=PL
         ‘His arrow did not catch fire, subsequently.’ (AY‐2NC‐5)In these examples the clitic na is not used adjectivally, but rather independently,
except for the second occurrence of na in (49)b. In (49)b and c the corresponding
noun phrase follows later, in (49)a, there is no corresponding noun phrase. Note
too, that the clitic form of the demonstrative cannot be marked for plural, as can
be observed in (49)a and c. Furthermore, in (49)c, the clitic seems to attach to the
preceding word instead of the following word. In this specific example, na is
followed by a small pause. These facts make it hard to classify these clitics as
proclitics or enclitics. The clitics an and a(t) are more restricted. They usually only
                                             64
Morphology
appear in adjectival position, and do not alternate with free forms in other
positions.
  Another group of reduced, unstressed clitics are reduced forms of the adverb
latijsha ‘then, after that, when’, which functions as a connector. The forms are lash
and la.(50) a   la=bobo‐ø=w=ja         ka‐deche‐che‐ø=w        kummë
         SEQ=hit;kill‐3=PL=SS   3SG‐meet;find‐CAU‐3=PL  tree
         ‘When they had killed him, they mounted wood.’ (OR‐20MA‐9)
     b   lash=li‐ujwa‐ni‐ø=w
         SEQ=DEL‐look.at‐INTL‐3=PL
         ‘Then they went looking.’ (FA‐6MA‐7)These proclitics do not interfere with the word‐stress of their host either. They are
themselves unstressed. They seem to be restricted to clause initial position, but the
full form latijsha (which is sometimes also reduced to lashsha, a reduced form that
still carries stress) also mainly occurs in clause‐initial position.
  Some other adverbs also have reduced forms, such as achu ‘like that’ (ash) and
anu ‘like this’ (an), ushta ‘before’ (ush). Examples of ash= are given in (51):(51) a   ash=ta‐ø=ya            latiji (…)

         ‘Then he spoke as follows.’

         ‘Noah said the following to them.’Finally, the personal pronouns sëë (1sg) and mëë (2sg) have the reduced forms së
and më, respectively.(52) a   achu         ka‐n‐dula‐y              ushta=së

A grammar of Yurakaré
As can be seen in the examples, it does not matter whether these reduced
pronouns precede ((52)b and d) or follow ((52)a and c) the predicate or noun they
are cross‐referenced with.
  In the examples of the remainder of the grammar, I will not indicate the
proclitics discussed in examples (48)‐(52) by means of the symbol ‘=’. I will in fact
not distinguish these enclitics from separate words in their representation, since
they do not seem to constitute one word with their host as much as the other
clitics do, as we will see. First, they do not form a phonological word with their
host as far as prosody is concerned; second, they seem to be more free positionally
than class II and class III clitics. Class I enclitics differ furthermore from class II
and III clitics in Yurakaré in that whereas the former generally have unreduced
and independent counterparts, the latter two do not.
  Before discussing class II clitics, I will first discuss class III clitics. Class III clitics
can be termed phrasal enclitics because they attach to a phrase‐final element. In
the nominal domain, the plural marker and the postpositional markers are
examples of phrasal enclitics:(53) a    matata ti‐pojore=w          vs.   ti‐pojore      matata=w
          big      1SG‐canoe=PL             1SG‐canoe      big=PL
          ‘my big canoes’                   ‘my big canoes’
      b   inele      elle=y           vs.   elle     inele=y
          inside     earth=LOC              earth inside=LOC
          ‘in the ground’                   ‘in the ground’The order of adjectives and nouns can be reversed, as can be seen in (53).
Nevertheless, the plural marker in (53)a as well as the postposition in (53)b remain
where they are: they attach to the rightmost element of the NP. Other nominal
enclitics are =chi ‘directional’, =jsha ‘ablative’, =la ‘instrumental’, =tina ‘comitative’
and =ja ‘subject emphasis marker’. I will discuss all of these in sections 4.2 and 4.3
below.
  NPs can be discontinuous in Yurakaré (cf. section 4.1). The head of the NP in
these circumstances is postverbal, while its modifier is in preverbal, focus position.
In these cases, the postpositions are still attached to the (rightmost) head noun,
while the preposed modifier does not have any postpositional marking:(54) a    danda‐shti        kummë matata=la
          go.up‐FUT.1SG.S tree        big=INS
          ‘I am going to climb up that big tree.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]
      b   matata danda‐shti             kummë=la
          big       go.up‐FUT.1SG.S     tree=INS
          ‘I am going to climb up that big tree.’ [MV‐31MA‐3]
                                              66
Morphology
Plural markers behave a little differently. When a plural NP is discontinuous,
usually both the modifier and the head noun are marked for plural:(55) lëshie=w ma‐bëjti         shunñe=w
     two=PL 3PL‐see:1SG.S man=PL
     ‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]Plural markers are generally found more often on both the head noun and the
modifier, even if the NP is not discontinuous, and especially with the order noun‐
adjective. Postpositional enclitics are never found on both elements.
  There are also a few clausal clitics that mostly attach to the clause‐final element.
These are modal and aspectual particles. Examples are =la ‘validational’, =bë
‘momentaneous’, =se ‘repetition (among other meanings)’ and =bëla (continuative).
They normally attach to the rightmost element of the clause, and are associated
semantically with the propositional level (cf. chapter 1):(56) a   yokkoshe      tiya‐m       mem=la
         true          eat‐2SG.S mother=VAL
         ‘You really did eat it, mother.’ (AR‐8MI‐25)

         ‘Let’s go poison some fish.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)

         NEG     see‐3=PL=NVR       DEM     brother=PL=CNT
         ‘His brothers still had not seen him yet.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)In (56)a the enclitic =la is attached to the noun denoting the addressee, in (56)b =bë
is attached to the object of the verb, and in (56)c, the enclitic =se attaches to the
subject. The enclitic =bëla in (56)d, finally, is attached to the subject. These enclitics
can also attach to other parts of speech:(57) a   tiya‐y=la
         eat‐1SG.S=VAL
         ‘I did eat it!’ (AR‐8MI‐25)

                                           67
A grammar of Yurakaré
In (57)a, =la attaches to a predicate, as does =se in (57)c. In (57)b, =bë attaches to an
adverb. In other words: these syntactic enclitics can attach to different hosts when
they are the last element of the clause. Occasionally, an element that pertains to
the clause comes after the clausal enclitic:(58) a     mala‐ø=la       noe     li‐ja‐nama‐ø=t=chi
           go.SG‐3=VAL     Noah DEL‐3SG‐dry‐3=DS=DIR
           ‘Noe went to where it was dry.’ (OR‐20MA‐2)
     b     kani      sewe‐ø=ya=bë         tiri
           not.yet born‐3=NVR=MOM Tiri
           ‘Tiri had not been born yet.’ (AR‐8MI‐9)In (58)a and b, the enclitics =la and =bë are followed by the subject‐NP of the clause
they belong to. This is especially clear with the enclitic =bëla ‘continuative’ in the
following example:(59) nij   bëjta‐ø=w=ya na      pi=w=bëla         samu          na   ma‐mme‐shama
     NEG see‐3=PL=NVR DEM brother=PL=CNT jaguar:PL DEM 3PL‐mother‐PST
     che‐jbëshë=w
     eat‐entity=PL
     ‘The brothers had not seen him yet, the ones that ate his late mother.’ (FA‐6MA‐6)  A special group of syntactic clausal enclitics are two types of clitics that change
according to the gender of the speaker: =ri/=ra for men and =yu/=ye for women:(60) a     lat   mapakka‐ø ati‐kka‐jtë‐ø           latiji=la=yu
           SEQ big‐3            DEM‐MEA‐SPC‐3      subsequently=VAL=EXPR.F
           ‘Then he was big. He must have been about that size. (FA‐6MA‐6)
     b     shülül‐ta‐ø     a‐dojo=ye
           tickly‐MID‐3    3SG.P‐body=NB.F
           ‘Her body is tickly.’ (DV‐14MA‐1)
     c     am=chi mala‐jtë          latiji=ri
           WH=DIR go.SG‐SPC‐3 subsequently=EXPR.M
           ‘Where did he go to?’(AR‐8MI‐59)
     d     media     ora‐nñu      kusu‐ø=naja    pëpë=ra
           half      hour‐DIM want‐3=DSC         grandfather=NB.M
           ‘Half an hour, the old one wanted.’ (FL‐14MA‐1)As mentioned above, clitics cannot be morphologically followed by affixes. They
can, however, be followed by a lexical element in a compound. In (61), the stem
mujumuju carries the locative postposition =y, which in turn is followed by the
compounded noun bëshë ‘thing, entity’.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83]"

A grammar of Yurakaré
The entities referred to by the cross‐reference affixes in (1) may additionally be
expressed by overt noun phrases, but this is not required. The utterances in (1) are
perfectly grammatical sentences. Polysynthesis in the strong sense (termed
incorporating in Comrie 1989a) does not apply to Yurakaré. The language does
not allow noun incorporation into a verb, and nominal compounding, although it
occurs (cf. section 3.2.4), is not a very frequent process.
  Another way to characterize the morphology of a language is head‐marking
versus dependent‐marking, proposed as a typological parameter by Nichols
(1986). Yurakaré has characteristics of both types, although the language is
basically head marking. Possessive relations are head marked, cf. example (2), as
are core grammatical relations subject and direct object, and applied objects, cf.
example (3):(2)   a   sëë        ti‐sibë
          1SG.PRN    1SG‐house
          ‘my house’
      b   shunñe a‐bashti
          man      3SG.P‐wife
          ‘the man’s wife.’(3)   a   ma‐bëjta-y       lëshie shunñe=w
          3PL‐see‐1SG.S two       man=PL
          ‘I see two men.’ [FL‐3MA‐4]
      b   ti‐ma‐n‐kaya‐ma           yarru 2
          1SG‐3PL‐IO‐give‐IMP.SG chicha
          ‘Give me chicha.’ [FP‐13MA‐13]Other, more peripheral semantic roles are encoded by enclitics that mark the
dependent noun phrase:(4)   a   yupa‐ø=ya        a‐mumuy         a‐ballata=tina
          enter.SG‐3=NVR 3SG.P‐all         3SG.P‐seed=COM
          ‘He went in with all his seeds.’ (AR‐3NC‐1)
      b   ta‐buybu=la           awëwë‐ø tejte‐shama
          1PL‐language=INS      cry‐3        grandmother‐PST
          ‘The old woman was crying in our language.’ (OR‐20MA‐10)Whether arguments are head or dependent marked furthermore has to do with
topicality. The more topical a referent, the more likely it is head marked (cf. Van
Gijn 2005).","[62, 63]"
"
8.1.4 Extended intransitives
Extended intransitives are verbs that have a basic valency of one, to which one
argument is added by means of an applicative construction:
                                         275
A grammar of Yurakaré
(16) a   ti‐la‐mala‐ø
         1SG‐AFO‐go.SG‐3
         ‘He left me behind.’
     b   të‐sawata‐m
         1SG.CO‐work‐2SG.S
         ‘You work with me.’The verbs mala and sawata are basically intransitive verbs, but in (16), there is an
additional argument marked on the verb, in (16)a an affected object, in (16)b a co‐
operative object. I consider all verbs that have a formally marked applied object as
extended verbs.
  As can be seen in Table 45, the numbers for the realization of subjects are very
similar for transitive and extended intransitive verbs. Both drop their subjects in
around 81% of the cases, while there is a preference for overt subjects to be
realized postverbally, like with intransitive verbs. I assume that the discourse
status of the subject is the same in transitive and extended intransitive verbs, i.e.
prototypically, highly topical participants are expressed in A position.
  There is a difference, though, between the behavior of direct objects of transitive
verbs (O) and applied objects (E) of extended intransitives. Extended intransitives
drop no less than 82.7% of their objects, whereas transitive verbs drop ‘only’
62.5%. These numbers suggest that the direct object position of a transitive verb is
more salient than the applied object position of an extended intransitive verb. In
fact, the number suggests that the salience of the applied object position is at the
level of transitive subjects, i.e. typically topical and accessible information. Onishi
(2000:136‐137), argues that applicatives are often used as discourse structuring
devices in the sense that they identify the topic of the discourse. Since topic is old
information, we would not expect too many overt NP applied objects. In Van Gijn
(2005) I argue that the split between the head‐marking patterns of the applicatives
on the one hand and the case/postposition‐marked adjuncts highly correlates with
topicality and animacy.
  When applied objects are overtly expressed, there is a slight preference for the
postverbal position. The numbers are very low, however, so the significance of
these percentages is questionable. In section 8.1.6 I will discuss the different
positions of arguments.","[290, 291]"

7.3.2 Combinations of epistemic enclitics
I have not encountered all logically possible combinations of the different
epistemic morphemes. This does, of course, not mean that they are impossible.
The combinations that do occur are mostly not very common. For most
combinations, therefore, it is of no use making any general remarks about their
combined meaning. The point of this section is to show which combinations have
been found and in which order. Remarks about the meaning should be taken as ad
hoc assessments. I have found the following combinations:=ya non‐veridical + =chi ignorative(72) a    shama‐shtu=y=chi                chata=la
          die.PL‐FUT:3PL.S=NVR=IGN        food=INS
          ‘They almost died of hunger.’ (FA‐6MA‐7)
     b    nij ka‐la‐bbë‐ti                    oshewo tiyu=y=chi              talipa=w
          NEG 3SG‐AFO‐cover‐POT:1SG.S         pot      eat:3PL.S=NVR=IGN chicken=PL
          ti‐chata
          1SG‐food
          ‘If I had not covered the pot, the chickens would have eaten all.’ [MH‐31MA‐6]The combination of =ya and =chi often gets a counterfactual, incompletive or
frustrative reading (cf. also (16) above). These readings do not follow
straightforwardly as the sum of the parts.=ya ‘non‐veridical’ + =laba ‘subjective’(73) a    mala‐ø=ya=laba        asha=chi
          go.SG‐3=NVR=SBJ       above=DIR
          ‘He tried to go up (but he could not).’ (AY‐3NC‐8)
      b   ta‐bobo‐shta‐ø=ya          samma ta‐ø=ya=lab            noe
          1PL‐hit;kill‐FUT‐3=NVR     water    say‐3=NVR=SBJ       Noah
          ‘The water is going to kill us, Noah said (in vain).’ (OR‐20MA‐3)This combination also gets a frustrative reading in these examples, in the sense of
‘in vain’ or ‘without success’.","[275, 276]"

1.2 The Yurakaré language1.2.1 Previous work
Up until now, the Yurakaré language has received relatively little attention. The
first study devoted completely to the language was La Cueva (1893). This
publication had been prepared by the Franciscan priest La Cueva at the beginning
of the nineteenth century. His notes were brought to France by Alcides d’Orbigny
and edited by Lucien Adam who eventually published them in 1893 8. The
publication consists of a grammatical description and a word list.
  The grammatical description, taking up 52 pages, covers many different areas:
from sounds to nominal and verbal morphosyntax, interjections and conjunctions,
as well as some example sentences. The word list covers 68 pages and is Spanish‐
Yurakaré. It is a rich source containing highly valuable material. It is also the first
attempt to devise a spelling for the language, even though this proposal is not
made explicit in the grammar.
  The next study devoted to the language is also by a Franciscan priest, Lassinger
(1915). This is a grammatical description, which is much more modest in
comparison to La Cueva’s work. It consists of around 15 pages, which give
information about nominal and verbal conjugations. There is no word list.
Lassinger’s work has been reprinted in Ribera et al. (1991).
  In 1980 and 1991, Marge Day produced two further important studies: a rather
large word list both Yurakaré‐Spanish (115 pages) and Spanish‐Yurakaré (123
pages), and a didactic grammar. In this grammar a consistent spelling is devised
(cf. section 2.2), and the study of the grammatical characteristics is taken out of the8Brinton (1891:297) summoned publishers to publish the manuscript of La Cueva. This
possibly may have led to the publication two years later.",[21]

3.3.3 Verbs
Verbs are prototypically actions: agentive actions involving concrete participants,
having a relatively short duration, and spatially more diffuse than nouns (Givón
2001‐I:52).
  The typical function of a verb is the predicative function (Croft 2003:184‐185,
Schachter 1985:9). This is not a distinguishing feature of verbs in Yurakaré,
however. Nouns and adjectives can also function as (stative) predicates without
any overt formal marking that indicates a change in lexical category.(86) a   së=ja              ulë‐y
         1SG.PRN=EMPH guayabochi.tree‐1SG.S
         ‘I was that, I was the guayabochi tree.’ (AR‐8MI‐7)
     b   Arsenio=ja         poropesor‐shta‐ø=la
         Arsenio=EMPH teacher‐FUT‐3=VAL
         Arsenio will be a teacher.’ [AT‐3MI‐121]Example (86)a is taken from a mythological text in which a Guayabochi tree
changes into a person. Now this person is telling a woman that he was the
Guayabochi tree. The subject sëja is marked with the emphasis marker =ja, which
appears almost exclusively on subjects. Furthermore, the predicate ulëy takes the
subject cross‐reference marker ‐y for first person singular. The word that functions
as a predicate has the notional characteristics of a noun, referring to a concrete,
                                            79
A grammar of Yurakaré
even specific item. In (86)b the predicate nominal is marked for future tense, a
category normally associated with verbs.
  Some predicate nominals can even take applicative prefixes. In the following
examples the affected object applicative (cf. 5.2.4) triggers the interpretation of
detachment in (87)a; in (87)b, the attachment‐reading is caused by the indirect
object applicative (cf. 5.2.3):(87) a   më=ja              ka‐la‐uli‐m               pa=ja             ka‐la‐uli‐p
         2SG.PRN=EMPH 3SG‐AFO‐penis‐2SG.S             2PL.PRN=EMPH 3SG‐AFO‐penis‐2PL.S
         ‘You (sg) cut off his penis; you (pl) cut off his penis.’(OR‐19MA‐2)
     b   li‐ma‐n‐shansha‐shta‐ø        latiji
         DEL‐3PL‐IO‐tooth‐FUT‐3        subsequently
         ‘He provided them with teeth.’ (AR‐8MI‐35)In (87)a, the predicate function is performed by a noun, which also refers to a
concrete and specific object. Like in (86)a, this predicate takes subject cross‐
reference marking (for second person singular and plural) and the overtly
expressed subject argument is marked with the emphasis marker =ja. However, in
(87)a we can also see that the object word can take valency increasing morphology
(the prefix la‐ for affected object ‐ cf. section 5.2.4) and consequently an object
complement, referring to the person who got his penis cut off. In (87)b, the
predicate nominal, not specific this time, takes another kind of applicative and is
modified by an adverb. Furthermore it takes the future tense marker ‐shta.
  Adjectives can be used as predicates as easily as object‐words (nouns):(88) a   maj~matata‐ø=ya latiji               a‐jukkulë
         INTS~big‐3=NVR      subsequently 3SG.P‐field
         ‘His field was then really big.’ (AR‐8MI‐42)
     b   yita‐p=naja
         good‐2PL.S=DSC
         ‘You are alright now.’ (AR‐8MI‐37)
     c   tëtë‐pshë=ja (…)      mij~mi‐n‐shuyulë‐jti‐ø        meme
         what‐entity=EMPH      INTS~2SG‐IO‐beautiful‐HAB‐3   mother
         ‘What do you find really beautiful, mother?’ (AR‐8MI‐50)In (88)a the property word functions as a predicate (cf. the non‐veridical enclitic
=ya, which only attaches to predicates. In (88)b, the property word yita takes the
subject marker ‐p for second person plural, and in (88)c, shuyulë takes the
applicative marker n‐ as well as the habitual marker ‐jti.
  Verbs, in short, cannot be distinguished from adjectives and nouns on the basis
of their function as predicates. However, verbs cannot be arguments of predicates
without any overt marking. They can be arguments of verbs either when they

different subject marker =ti (cf. chapter 8.2.4):(89) a     na=yj        ma‐ssë‐ø=w        na      wiwi‐pshë=w

           ‘I finished harvesting rice (my harvesting rice is finished for me)’ [MH‐24MA‐4]There is no clear answer to the question whether the ti‐marked clause indicates a
‘when’‐clause rather than a real argument, i.e.: ‘When I had harvested my rice I
was finished.’ However, ti‐marked clauses can take postpositions, which are
normally associated with noun phrases:(90) mashi‐ø=ti=jsha       ajuyja‐shta‐tu
     rain‐3=DS=ABL         fish‐FUT‐1PL.S
     ‘Even if it rains we’ll go fishing.’ [MV‐24MA‐22]There are also constructions such as the following:(91) nij  poyde winani‐tu     puwa‐tu=ja
     NEG can      walk‐1PL.S drunk‐1PL.S=SS
     ‘We could not walk when we were drunk.’ [FA‐28MA‐1]The sequence poyde winanitu seems to be a case where a verb (winanitu), without
any further measures being taken is used as an argument of the verb (Hengeveld’s
1992 criterion). However, on closer scrutiny, there seem to be measures that have
been taken after all. The matrix verb poyde does not carry any subject marking, and
is conjoined to the adjacent VP. In fact, as I will be discussing in chapter 8.2.1, this
is one way of marking subordination. The matrix verb can also be fully inflected,
but then the complement verb has to be marked by means of the enclitic =ti.(92) nij     poydi=la           ma‐alkansa=ni=ti
     NEG     can:1SG.S=VAL      3PL‐reach‐INTL:1SG.S=DS
     ‘I couldnʹt reach them.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)Action‐words can modify a noun only if they are marked as a relative clause by
means of the different subject marker =ti, the same subject marker =ja, or by means
of a compound with bëshë (reduced to pshë) ‘entity’. In (93)c we again see that
nouns can be in adjectival function as long as their meaning allows for it:

"5.1 Person marking, valency and transitivity
Dixon & Aikhenvald (2000:3) make a distinction between valency and transitivity:
“There are two main transitivity types ‐ intransitive (with core argument S) and
intransitive (with A and O) ‐ and plain and extended subtypes of each (depending on
whether or not E [extension to core ‐ RvG] is also in the core”. Schematically, this can
be represented as follows:(a) intransitive                       S
(b) extended intransitive              S              E
(c) transitive                     A         O
(d) extended transitive            A         O        EValency, in this view, relates to the number of core arguments, i.e. one in (a), two in (b),
two in (c) and three in (d). I will follow Dixon & Aikhenvald in making the distinction
between valency and transitivity, since it is a useful one for describing the Yurakaré
system.
  In Yurakaré, the distinction between valency and transitivity is directly reflected in
the formal behavior of the verb. Subjects and direct objects are obligatorily cross‐
referenced on the verb; intransitive verbs do not have object markers, whereas
transitive verbs do. Any extension of transitivity is formally marked, e.g. by means of
applicative or causative markers, even if the extended argument belongs to the
semantic argument structure of a verb.
  As mentioned, the two basic arguments, subject and direct object are both cross‐
referenced on the verb, subjects are cross‐referenced by suffixes, objects by prefixes.
The paradigms look as follows:
                                           143

There is no distinction between first person plural inclusive and exclusive, nor is there
a gender distinction 1. As for the two zero elements in the paradigm, I do not consider
the zero element in the object paradigm to be actually present; it is simply a gap in the
paradigm triggering a default interpretation of third person singular, the typical
interpretation for a zero element cross‐linguistically (Siewierska 2004: 24). The zero
element in the third person singular and plural subject is a different matter. The
nominal plural marker is =w (cf. section 4.2). I assume that this plural enclitic needs a
nominal element to have scope over. Viewing the subject paradigm as such
furthermore has the advantage that it shows that the bound subject affixes follow the
same pattern as the free pronouns:                  Table 31 ‐ Comparison of free pronouns and subject markers

                          3pl    l‐ati=w               ‐ø=w
Judging from the forms of some of the markers in comparison to the free pronouns
(e.g. mëë vs. ‐m, tuwa vs. ‐tu, paa vs. ‐p) the subject paradigm and the free pronouns are
related. The free pronoun paradigm, which consists of four personal pronouns – for
third person reference demonstrative pronouns are used – shows suppletive forms for
singular and plural first and second person pronouns, whereas the demonstratives
referring to third persons are marked for plural in a regular way, by means of the
enclitic =w. This same distinction between first and second persons on the one hand
and third on the other is observed in the subject marking paradigm.","[158, 159]"

3.3 Parts of speech
As is shown in Anward et al. (1997), languages can differ from each other in
several respects when it comes to the inventory of their lexical categories. They
can differ in what kind of categories they identify; the distinction between verbs
and nouns seems to be universal (Schachter 1985:6‐7), though even that is
questioned (cf. Hengeveld 1992:67 for Tuscarora). Adjectives, (manner) adverbs
and smaller parts of speech are not universal at all. Languages can also differ in
terms of the criteria that can be used to distinguish their lexical categories. The
general approach in any language to distinguish lexical categories is that “the
primary, definitional properties of parts of speech are semantic or pragmatic,
rather than form related; (…) semantic or pragmatic features are part‐of‐speech
defining only if there is at least one formal characteristic that correlates with
them” (Anward et al. 1997:172). Formal characteristics can be found on the
syntactic, morphological or phonological level 11. Languages differ as to which of
these formal characteristics correlates with the semantic‐pragmatic features.
  These differences, together with the fact that the boundaries between the
different parts of speech are sometimes rather fuzzy (cf. Payne 1997:32), make it a
difficult task to identify the parts of speech of a language. Therefore the
distinctions I have chosen to make, although based on notional, syntactic,
morphological, and sometimes even phonological criteria, do not reflect rigid
classes with clear‐cut boundaries, but rather they reflect tendencies associated
with certain lexical classes.
  When these precautions are taken into consideration, we might say that
Yurakaré distinguishes seven lexical classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs,
ideophones, interjections and clitic particles. I will discuss each of the parts of
speech in turn, stating their (prototypical) notional, syntactic and morphological
characteristics as well as subclassifications. I will start with nouns (3.3.1), followed
by adjectives (3.3.2), verbs (3.3.3), adverbs (3.3.4), ideophones (3.3.5), interjections
(3.3.6), and finally clitic particles (3.3.7).","[86, 87]"

The clause
In (54)a, the clause combination chitta mala is as a whole subordinate to the verb
timbë. This means that the subject of chitta mala is not indicated on either of these
verbs, but rather it is marked as the direct object of ibëbë. In (54)b, the construction
tëshujuta timbë, which in itself is a clause combination, is superordinate to the
subject clause abëssëyti. The construction with the subordinate marker =ti will be
discussed in section 8.2.4 below. Note that, even though the causee is marked on
the verb timbë in (54)b, it is also marked on the dependent verb, as a cooperative
object. 20 Apparently subject agreement is blocked, but object agreement is not,
even though we are dealing with coreference.
  This morphosyntactic type of clause combinations is used when the two events
are inextricably interwoven. States of affairs that are encoded in this way are
manner clauses, like the ones discussed above, where the leftmost, subordinated
verb can be replaced by a manner adverb:(55) achu        ti‐m‐bë‐ø
     like.that   1SG‐IO‐treat‐3
     ‘Like that he did to me.’These manner verbs can also be path‐movement verbs or location‐manner verbs
combining with a semantically more or less empty movement verb like mala/bali
‘go’ or winani ‘walk’.
  Some complement relations can be expressed as VP‐conjunctions.
Complementation can be defined as “the syntactic situation that arises when a
notional sentence or predicate is an argument” (Noonan 1985:42). Normally,
complementation in Yurakaré is marked by the subordinating particle =ti (cf.
section 8.2.4), as in (54)b. Some complement relations, however, can additionally
be represented as follows:(56) ti‐m‐pëlë        ma‐pu‐y=naja             ti‐arush
     1SG‐IO‐finished 3PL‐take.PL‐1SG.S=DSC     1SG‐rice
     ‘I’m done harvesting my rice. [FL‐24MA‐1]The predicate pëlë ‘be finished’ can take a nominal subject:(57) ti‐m‐pëlë‐ø=w=naja              ti‐tib    talipa=w
     1SG‐IO‐be.finished‐3=PL=DSC 1SG‐pet chicken=PL
     ‘I have finished off my chickens.’ [FL‐24MA‐1]In (57), the subject of the predicate pëlë is the noun phrase titib talipaw. In (56), this
subject argument has been replaced by another predicate. This combination of
20This is due to the semantics of the verb shujuta ‘to sweat’. The experiencer of sweating is
always indicated as a cooperative object.","[311, 312]"

In section 4.2 above, I have characterized class I nouns as the default type: nouns that
have a marked opposition singular versus plural; class II nouns are inherently plural
and inherently collective; class III nouns are inherently singular; class IV nouns, finally,
are inherently singular and inherently collective.
  As can be observed in Table 32, the marker ka‐ as an indicator of third person
singular direct objects only occurs with class III nouns in some cases and with class IV
nouns in all cases. In constructions such as in (3), ka‐ is used as a cross‐reference marker
for all third persons singular, no matter what nominal class. In Table 33, an overview is
given of the paradigms of the direct object and the comitative object with regard to
class I nouns:               Table 33 ‐ Comparing inherently transitive with extended transitive

A second difference between transitive roots and extended intransitives of the type
exemplified in (3)b and c, is related to verbal number (cf. section 6.2.2). A handful of
verbs in Yurakaré vary in their form according to the number of participants taking
part in the event. This system of participant‐based verbal number is organized
according to an ergative pattern: intransitive verbs change form according to the
number of the S argument, transitive verbs change according to the number of the O
argument, a pattern universally attested in languages that have such a system of
participant based verbal number (cf. Corbett 2000: 253):(4)   a    mala‐y                        b   bali‐ø=w

                                              146
Verbal agreement, voice & valency
  The verb roots mala (for singular) and bali (for plural) change according to the
number of the subject participant, cf. (4)a and b; chitta and kokko 2 in (4)c and d, change
according to the number of the direct object participant. With an extended intransitive
like ka‐mala‐ø, the number of object participants has no consequences for the form of
the verb: it still changes according to the number of the subject participant. In other
words: the ergative pattern of verbal plural marking is sensitive only to the transitivity
value of the root.(5)   a   ma‐mala‐ø
          3PL‐go.SG‐3SG
          ‘He takes them with him.’
      b   ka‐bali‐ø=w
          3SG‐go.SG‐3=PL
          ‘They take it with them.’In these two respects (i.e. consistant overt marking of third person singular direct
object and no influence on participant based verbal number) the comitative object
construction patterns with other, more clearly marked applicative constructions.
  There is another construction worth mentioning in the context of the discussion on
transitivity and valency in Yurakaré:(6)   a   latijsha    ka‐posojto‐ø=ya        a‐tulujta
          then        3SG‐explode‐3=NVR 3SG.P‐brain
          ‘Then her brain exploded.’ (AR‐8MI‐52)
      b   ti‐tenche=w           ma‐dele‐ø=w
          1SG‐necklace=PL       3PL‐fall.SG‐3=PL
          ‘My necklace fell.’ [FP‐13MA‐13]In these constructions, the verb is still semantically intransitive, but formally, two
participants are marked: the zero element for subject and ka‐ for object in (6)a 3, and the
third person plural prefix ma‐ for object and the markers ‐ø and =w together for third
person plural subject. Tulujta ‘brain’ is a class III noun, tenchew ‘necklace’ a class II
noun. It seems that the verbs in (6) agree twice with the S‐participant. There is some
evidence, however, that the object agreement only refers to the number of the
participants, and not to the person:
2 The form jokko is a surface variant of kokko: /k/ changes into [h], spelled j after a vowel, cf.
section 2.3.2.
3 The form marked with ka‐ is not found with class I nouns.","[160, 161, 162]"

3.1 Introducing Yurakaré morphology
From the perspective of morphological typology, Yurakaré can be characterized as
an agglutinating language. In the ideal case of an agglutinating language “a word
may consist of more than one morpheme, but the boundaries between morphemes
in the word are always clear‐cut” (Comrie 1989a:43). This characterization fits
Yurakaré morphology to a high degree. There is some fusion, however, especially
within the system of participant reference on the verb. Here the categories of
person and number are fused, and sometimes also semantic function (e.g. in the
cross‐referencing system, cf. section 5.1). On the whole, however, Yurakaré
morphology provides us with a fairly straightforward picture of an agglutinating
language.
  On another dimension, isolating versus polysynthetic, Yurakaré can be placed
more towards the polysynthetic end, as was suggested already by the morpheme
per word ratio. I take polysynthetic to mean the possibility “to combine a large
number of morphemes, be they lexical or grammatical, into a single word,
corresponding to a sentence of English” (Comrie 1989a:45). Yurakaré, with its
elaborate person reference system and applicatives (cf. sections 5.1 and 5.2) fits
this description. To give an example, consider the following:(1)   a    ti‐ma‐y‐mala‐ma
           1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG
           ‘Go and get them for me!’ [AA‐15MA‐9]
      b    ti‐ma‐la‐che‐ø
           1SG‐3PL‐AFO‐eat‐3
           ‘He ate them from me (e.g. from my plate).’ [MV‐14MA‐26]
1I have not counted zero morphemes and I have counted bound roots + required
derivational morphemes as one. I did count enclitics. The total number of words was 6,976,
the total number of morphemes 14,289.",[62]

     3SG‐3SG‐AFO‐go.SG‐3 3SG.P‐fish‐MID         fish
     ‘The fish went off taking my fishing line.’ [MH‐8MA‐14]There are no combinations of comitative object and direct object, since comitative
objects only combine with intransitive roots. This means that we can expand the
template of (59) as follows:(62) position    2   ‐       1   ‐    0
                 CO ‐        DO ‐     root
                 IO ‐        COM
                 AFOWhen the purposive object is combined with the indirect object, the prefix referring to
the purposive object follows the prefix referring to the indirect object. The applicative
marker for indirect object is lost, but the vowel in the prefixes with the vowel /a/ in
them (third person singular and the plural participants) is changed to /u/:Indirect object & purposive object(63) a   ti‐ja‐y‐danda‐ma            toronja

     ‘Spit at him for me.’ [FP‐15MA‐3]The indirect object cross‐referencing prefix comes first, followed by the cross‐
referencing prefix for the affected object, and then the applicative marker la‐ follows.
The element n‐ is not the applicative marker for indirect object, but rather the marker
for imperative singular (cf. section 6.3.5). There seems to be only one position for the
applicative markers.
  The order of cross referencing prefixes can be schematized into the following
template, which is an elaboration of the templates of (59) and (62):(66) position   4         3         2        1                 0

                                    POThe indirect object precedes the affected object, direct object, comitative object, and the
purposive object. We cannot say much about the place of the cooperative object, except
that it appears before the direct object. The affected object precedes the direct object
and the comitative object. Direct object, comitative object and purposive object share
the slot immediately before the applicative markers; they cannot be combined. There is
one position for an applicative marker. When two applied objects are combined that
have a separate applicative marker, one of these objects is always the indirect object; in
this case the applicative marker for indirect object is lost. In some circumstances this
results in a vowel change in the cross‐referencing prefixes from /a/ to /u/. Some
speakers only change the indirect object cross‐referencing prefixes, others also the
prefixes referring to the purposive object.","[182, 183, 184]"

A grammar of Yurakaré
the role of applied objects differ across extended intransitives and extended
transitives.
  With regard to the position of overtly expressed direct objects (preverbal or
postverbal), not much can be said. In transitive verbs the odds are roughly even.
In ditransitive verbs there seems to be a slight preference for the preverbal
position, but the number of occurences is too small to draw any reliable
conclusions. There does seem to be a slight preference for postverbal position for
the applied objects, although, again, the number of instances of ditransitive verbs
is too low to draw firm conclusions.
  In most instances (82%), only one or none of the three arguments is overtly
expressed. This can be seen as another instantiation of what Du Bois (2003:68) calls
the One Lexical Argument Constraint:(18) Avoid more than one lexical core argumentThe idea behind this constraint is that, even if verbs provide in their argument
structure more than one core argument position, only one of them will be used to
introduce a lexical noun phrase. The others are mainly used for referents that have
already been mentioned in the discourse. These latter argument positions are
more often expressed either by pronouns or by zero forms. As with two‐place
verbs, in three‐place verbs, the position of the direct object is the preferred
position to introduce new referents. This apparently is a pervasive pattern in
discourse throughout the languages of the world.","[292, 293]"

                         Language and Literature at the University of Amsterdam in 1994. After receiving
                         his propedeutics in 1995, he switched to General Linguistics, also at the University
                         of Amsterdam. During his study he developed interest for Amerindian languages
                         (he took courses in Quechua and Carib at Leiden University), theoretical
                         linguistics (both functional and formal) and language contact. In line with this last
                         interest he spent half a year at the University of Aarhus in Denmark where he took

                         largely a combination of his main fields of interest. After his studies he started

adverb from an adjective or noun, and ba‐che is a verb that means ‘to send’. This verb
has a non‐causative counterpart ba‐ta ‘to go’, with the middle marker ‐tA.i‐ ‘verbalizer’Since nouns and adjectives can occur in predicative position (cf. section 3.3.3), there is
not much need for verbalizing morphology. There is one verbalizing prefix, however: i‐
. Addition of this prefix triggers the interpretation ‘to have X’:(107) a   ana=jsha i‐tanti‐ø=w

ultimately be the possession of the maker, in (108)d the subject gets water that will be
in his possession. The example in (108)e, finally, can be rephrased as ‘he has language,
he has the word’.‐jta ‘smell’The suffix ‐jta on a noun means that it smells like what is expressed in the noun:(109) a   dyarru‐jta‐m

          ‘He appeared to her as a Yurakaré.’ (AR‐8MI‐3)The form ‐shku is probably decomposable into ‐sh and ‐ku. The element ‐sh is found on
adjectives to form manner adverbs; ‐ku is harder to interpret, but it may be that it is the                                              127

ku‐ which denotes cooperative object third person (cf. section 5.2.2). The verb ta ‘say’,
which is probably the source for the middle marker ‐tA, takes the cooperative object
applicative form to mark addressees.
   First and second person pronouns can take the adverbializer ‐shku as well as ‐sh, but
if they do, they take an intervening morpheme ‐wa:(111) a   tuwa‐wa‐shku‐ta             tuwa       ta‐buybu=la   ma‐n‐dyërërë‐jti

Apart from the subclassification of nouns proper on the basis of number and collective
marking (cf. section 4.2), the class of nouns can be further subdivided into a number of
subclasses. First, we can distinguish pronouns. There are three types of pronouns:
demonstrative, personal and the question word ama.","[140, 141, 142, 143]"

This applicative construction has several related meanings. First, with verbs of
movement or caused‐movement verbs such as ‘giving’, ‘sending’ and the like, it
indicates the goal of that movement, or the recipient.(21) a   ti‐n‐wita‐m
         1SG‐IO‐arrive.SG‐2SG.S
         ‘You came to me, arrived at my place.’ (AR‐8MI‐19)
     b   mi‐m‐bache‐ni
         2SG‐IO‐leave.CAU‐INTL:1SG.S
         ‘I am going to send it to you.’[FA‐2MA‐8]
     c   a‐mumuy pa‐n‐kaya‐shti
         3SG.P‐all     2SG‐IO‐give‐FUT:1SG.S
         ‘I will give it all to you (pl).’ (AY‐2NC‐9)
     d   ka‐n‐chaya‐ø=ya
         3SG‐IO‐feed‐3=NVR
         ‘She gave him food.’ (AR‐8MI‐20)Related to this is the use of the indirect object applicative with communication verbs,
where the indirect object encodes the addressee:(22) a   mi‐n‐dyuju‐shti
         2SG‐IO‐inform‐FUT:1SG.S
         ‘I am going to inform you.’ (AR‐8MI‐46)
     b   ti‐n‐kama‐ø
         1SG‐IO‐call‐3
         ‘He is calling me.’ [HC‐23MA‐5]
     c   ti‐n‐dyajuya‐m
         1SG‐IO‐gossip‐2SG.S
         ‘You are telling me gossip.’ [VP‐6MA‐29]Apart from these two related meanings, the indirect object indicates an interested
party, often called ‘ethical dative’, ‘dative of (dis)advantage’ or ‘dative of interest’ (cf.
Payne 1997:192‐194, Palmer 1994:32). Semantically, an ethical dative construction can
be described as follows: “The circumstances described by the predicate have significant
consequences for the interested party, whose referent is not in control of the event”
(Fried 1999:492). The type of interest that is indicated by this kind of construction can,
in many languages be either beneficiary or adversative, without any formal distinction
(cf. Shibatani 1994:463). In Yurakaré, however, these two subtypes of the ethical dative
have different formal encodings, with which they more or less coincide. The ‘indirect
object’ encoding, with the prefix n‐, is by and large associated with goal/approach and
beneficiary, while the ‘affected object’ encoding, with the prefix la‐ which is discussed
in section 5.2.4 below, is associated with source/separation and adversity.","[168, 169]"

8.1.5 Ditransitive verbs
Ditransitive verbs are of two types: extended transitives (17)a, and doubly
extended intransitives, (17)b:
                                         276
The clause

             1SG‐3PL‐kill‐3=PL 1SG‐fish=PL      1SG‐pet dog:PL
             ‘My dogs ate my fish on me.’ [FL‐13MA‐9]

             1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG=IGN      3SG.CO‐say‐3=NVR
             ‘“Go and get them for me!”, she said to him.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)In (17)a, the verb che ‘eat’ has a basic valence of two (i.e. a subject and a direct
object, and to this is added a third, applied argument, an affected object (cf. section
5.2.4). In (17)b, the verb mala ‘go’, is a one‐place verb. In (17)b, there is also an
indirect object and a purposive object (cf. section 5.2.5), extending the valency to
three.
  Ditransitives do not occur frequently in texts. They constitute only about 4.2% of
all predicates. Almost all instances I encountered in the texts were combinations of
a direct object with an applied object (89%). The subjects of these verbs are overtly
expressed in 82.3% of all cases. This is roughly equivalent with subjects of
transitive and extended intransitive verbs. In Table 45 above I collapsed the group
of applied objects and direct objects. If we look at their behavior separately in
ditransitives, we get the following picture:          Table 48 - Direct objects (O) and applied objects (E) in ditransitive verbs
                     %OV %VO %Vo %EV %VE %Ve
                     28.26 17.39 54.35 4.35             6.52      89.13Applied objects are dropped much more often than direct objects. The percentages
are comparable to O‐drop in transitive predicates and E ‐drop in extended
intransitive predicates:     Table 49 - Comparing direct object and applied object across multivalent verbs
                            %OV %VO %Vo %EV %VE %Ve

for ditransitives). The same holds for the dropping of applied objects: 82.7% in the
case of extended intransitives, 89.1% in the case of ditransitives. It seems that the
role of direct objects does not differ in ditransitive and transitive verbs, nor does
7To be able to compare like with like, I have disregarded instances of doubly extended
intransitives, i.e. a one place predicate with two applied objects. In practice this appeared
to be only a small number; by far most instances were combinations of a direct object and
an indirect object.","[291, 292]"

Morphology
semantic head of the noun phrase. This can be described as follows: “the head of a
noun phrase is the one word within the phrase that refers to the same entity the
whole phrase refers to” (Payne 1997:33). So in an example such as (69), we might
say that shunñe ‘man’ is the semantic head, and matata ‘big’ refers to a property of
the man.(69) matata shunñe
     big        man
     ‘a/the big man’It can be said that the NP as a whole refers to a man, not to a big. In constructions
such as the following, however, it seems that typical noun candidates are in fact
not the semantic head:(70) a   chajmu shunñe
         dog       man
         ‘male dog’ [MV‐32MA‐9]
     b   dyolojoto shunñe
         amardillo man
         ‘armadillo‐man’ 12 (AY‐2NC‐2)These are not morphological compounds, since each word carries its own primary
stress. Nevertheless, constructions such as the ones in (70) are rather marginal. In
the prototypical situation it is a property word that is in the modifying role.
  The noun is not obligatory in the noun phrase, even though it is present in the
vast majority of cases. If the head noun is missing, we are dealing with elliptic
constructions in which it is clear from the context which object is referred to.(71) a   maj~matata       ti‐jusu‐ø
         INTS~big         1SG‐want‐3
         ‘I want a really big one [i.e. field].’ (AR‐8MI‐41)
     b   sëjsëshi‐nñu tütü‐ø          ajani
         green‐DIM        sit‐3       below:LOC
         ‘The little green one [i.e. plate] is below.’ (FL‐14MA‐2)In (71)a, the reference is to a field, which has been the topic of conversation for the
last couple of utterances 13. The same can be said for (71)b, where the topic of
12 This might also refer to a male armadillo, but this particular example from a narrative
refers to a male person, who has shared characteristics with an armadillo.
13 The word maj~matata cannot be interpreted as a predicative complement of the verb ti‐jusu, (‘I want it to be big’), since then it would have to be marked with the intentional
marker ‐ni and the subordinate marker =ti (cf. section 8.2.4)
                                              73
A grammar of Yurakaré
conversation has been plates. It is only in these circumstances, i.e. when the
referent is known from the context that we can have an adjective by itself in
argument position.
  Other criteria to establish the head of the NP are not really useful for Yurakaré.
There is no clear agreement within the NP, while grammatical relations, number
and articles cliticize to the NP as a whole rather than to one of the words in it.
  Functionally, some nouns can be used as adjectives, as is shown in example (70)
above. Other such nouns are pëpë (grandfather/old), tejte (grandmother/old) and
yee (woman). Nouns can also function as predicates, without any overt marking to
signal the change of category. I will come back to this when discussing verbs in
section 3.3.3 below.
  Morphologically, nouns can be set apart on the basis that they are the only word
class that takes possessive marking in the form of personal prefixes, cf. (72)a or
predicative possession, by means of the prefix i‐, cf. (72)b:(72) a   ti‐sibë
         1SG‐house
         ‘my house’
     b   atta=jsha     i‐tanti‐ø
         other=ABL     VBL‐eye;face‐3
         ‘He had his face on the other side.’ (OR‐19MA‐20)However, some animals, i.e. pets cannot be possessed, they need a lexical
classifier:(73) a   *ti‐talipa
     b   ti‐tiba    talipa
         1SG‐pet chicken
         ‘my chicken’Property words cannot take possessive prefixes:(74) a *ti‐matata   ‘my big one’
     b *i‐matata    ‘He has a big one.’ (JMB‐PC)Action words normally cannot take possessive prefixes either, except for some
verbs. When they are marked with the possessive prefixes, these words refer to
the result of an action and are nominal:
                                           74

         ‘my cooking’
     c   ti‐sawata
         1SG‐work
         ‘my work.’In conclusion, even though there is some spill‐over and the criteria have
exceptions, nouns can be characterized by the fact that they are the semantic head
of an NP, control the number behavior of the NP, and that they are by and large
the only word class that takes possessive morphology. Nouns, and
subclassifications of nouns will be discussed in more detail in section 4.4.","[87, 88, 89, 90]"

          ‘They always hammered until they were caught by the night.’ (OR‐20MA‐1)In (83)a, there is a simple predicate ensew, modified by the adverb chajti, which directly
follows it. Even though I have never encountered chajti in preverbal position, it does
not seem impossible, especially when the meaning is stressed.
  This adverb often has a wide scope. In (83)a, the scope of the adverb extends to the
location mentioned. They did not ‘always just drink’, but ‘they always drank there’. In
(83)b, the adverb has scope over the entire proposition isamaya malaya chërë. And for
(83)c, finally, the same argumentation can be given: the adverb has scope over the
whole proposition. In addition, the repetition in this example already indicates
iterativity.
  There can be elements in between the predicate and the adverb, like direct objects, cf.
(84)a, applied objects, cf. (84)b, and even adjuncts, cf. (84)c:(84) a    ñowwo idu=ya            tiya‐ø    lëtta ñowwo chajti=ya        a‐yee

          ‘They always waited for their husbands like that with chicha.’ (AR‐8MI‐90)It may very well be the case that chajti has a verbal origin, and to some extent it still
functions as a predicate. There are two parts recognizable within the word: cha and jti.
The latter is the marker for habitual aspect, and the former is seen in many words
based on the demonstrative ati (cf. section 4.4.4 above):(85) ati          ‘that’
     achu(ta)     ‘(be) like that’
     (a)chama     ‘(do/be) like that’The word chajti then probably means ‘it is (was) always like that’. Another clue
pointing to the verbal nature of chajti, is the fact that it often occurs with the non‐                                           213

veridical enclitic =ya, normally only associated with predicates (cf. section 7.1.1). On the
other hand, it does not fully behave like a verb in the sense that when two clauses are
combined there often is an intonation break and morphological marking on the
dependent predicate; if there is no intonation break, there is a fixed order, in which the
dependent predicate precedes the main predicate. Chajti does not comply with this
behavior.
  The adverb lacha ‘too’ or its variant layj also seems to have a relation to the
demonstrative ati, with the specificity prefix l‐. Positionally, lacha is mostly postverbal,
either directly following the predicate or with some other element in between:(86) a   latijsha ma‐dyuja‐jti‐ø=ya       lacha mororuma              ma‐la‐deche‐ø=ti

         3PL‐arrow too
         ‘Then the ancestors made their arrows as well.’ (AY‐3NC‐8)In (86)a, the focus is on the mountain person’s characteristics, after telling what they
looked like and how they behaved, the adverb lacha contrasts this characteristic with
others of the mororuma. In (86)b, the former grandfathers are contrasted with other
people who are also fishing at the creek. In (86)c, finally, the whole proposition of the
former grandfathers making their arrows is marked with the adverb.
  Lacha can, however, also be in clause‐initial position:(87) layj tuwa       ta‐tebe       ana    emme

     ‘This too was going to be our meat.’ (OR‐19MA‐20)6.5.3 Modal and phasal adverbs
Unlike temporal and aspectual adverbs, modal adverbs tend to precede the predicate.
The negative adverb nish (~nij), the phasal adverbs kaj ‘still’, and kani ‘not yet’ as well
as sey (si) ‘almost’ directly precede the predicate:

          almost 3SG‐AFO‐die.SG‐3=NVR          3SG.P‐sister
          ‘His sister almost died on him.’ (AY‐2NC‐9)The adverbs kaj, nish and sey are somewhat deviant words in that they are
monosyllabic, while there is a prohibition on monosyllabic content words. This is
something that they have in common with a number of state/manner adverbs (cf.
section 6.5.6). Manner adverbs, as we will see below, are also preverbal.
  Some of the modal adverbs are morphologically transparent. The negative adverb
nish has an independent form nijta (i.e. which can occur without a verb), which seems
to be nij + ta (middle voice marker) meaning, ‘there is no(ne)’. The form nish has ‐sh,
which is an adverbializing suffix. The adverb kani also seems to be a fused form,
combining kaj and ni (negative).
  Two further, epistemic modal adverbs seem to be intermediate between adverbs and
verbs: yokkoshe ‘true’ and kusuti ‘maybe’.(89) a    yokkoshe tiya‐m           mem=la         tiya‐m=ja         ku‐tu=ya

          ‘After maybe two months, he was already big.’ (AR‐8MI‐27)In (89) yokkoshe and kusuti are used adverbially here. Yokkoshe, however, can occur by
itself, without a predicate to modify, a characteristic not associated with adverbs in
Yurakaré:(90) yokkoshe mem=la            nish     ta‐n‐shiwa‐m=la          ku‐ta‐ø=w=ya
     true          mother=VAL NEG        1PL‐IO‐lie‐2SG.S=VAL     3SG.CO‐say‐3=PL=NVR

                                             215
A grammar of Yurakaré
The end of the first clause yokkoshe memla is marked by the affirmative marker =la, this
means that yokkoshe here functions as a predicate.
  Kusuti seems to be a fixed expression which can be analyzed as kusu‐ø=ti, ‘if it wants’.
Kusu is a verb meaning ‘to want’, =ti is a subordinating enclitic, expressing, among
other things conditionality (cf. section 8.2.4).","[227, 228, 229, 230, 231]"

          ‘in the time of their harvest’ [DAY‐1980‐35]4.4.3 Category‐changing derivation
There are three category‐changing derivational suffixes that can be found on nouns: an
adjectivizer ‐kka, a verbalizer i‐ and an adverbializer ‐shku(ta).‐kka: ‘measure’The suffix ‐kka is added mostly to demonstrative pronouns to indicate that the size of
something is comparable to a size indicated (mostly by holding the hand on a certain
height).(98) ana‐kka‐ø
     DEM‐MEA‐3
     ‘He is this big.’ (indicating height with hand)The suffix ‐kka changes the nominal element into an adjectival one; consequently it can
receive the collective marker ‐ima or the distributive marker ‐uma:(99) a‐werta        ana‐kk‐ima
     3SG.P‐basket   DEM‐MEA‐COL
     ‘His basket was about this big.’ (AY‐3NC‐7)It is also found on proper names (100), as well as on the question word ama (101):(100) ti‐tëë                karina‐kka     ati
      1SG‐niece;nephew      Karina‐MEA     DEM
      ‘She was the size of Karina.’ (BT‐27MA‐10)(101) aj~ama‐kka        mi‐jusu‐ø     ta‐jukkulë    mi‐n‐dula‐ni=ti

      ‘What size would you like me to make our field?’ (AR‐8MI‐41)The suffix ‐kka in the sense of size is often found in combination with the amplification
marker ‐lë. When this suffix is attached, the marker ‐kka loses its gemination and is
                                            124
The noun phrase
rendered ‐ja after a vowel (because of the lenition of [k], see section 2.3.2 above). The
interpretation of this combination is small size:(102) kumë‐nñu ana‐ja‐lë               ajtilya‐nñu       ti‐ja‐mal‐cha‐m
      tree‐DIM     DEM‐MEA‐AMP         splinter‐DIM      1SG‐3SG‐go.SG‐JUS‐2SG.S
      ‘Bring me a small tree, only this size, a splinter!’ (OR‐20MA‐2)Even though the marker seems to attach mostly to nominal elements, it can also appear
on the verb abibë ‘to be enough’:(103) abibë‐kka‐ø‐naja          ta‐jukkulë
      be.enough‐MEA‐3‐DSC       1PL‐field
      ‘Our field is big enough now.’ (AR‐8MI‐42)As mentioned in section 4.3 above, in combination with the locative marker =y and the
ablative marker =jsha, this suffix can also indicate a certain stretch of time:(104) a   nentaya    ati‐kka=y          ka‐toro‐ø      ati
          maybe      DEM‐MEA=LOC        3SG‐end‐3      DEM

          ‘Then he made [salt], and after that time (she said): “Leave me some.”’

root it attaches to. This is probably for semantic reasons: to indicate the size of
something presupposes a root that has some size, while in the temporal sense, it only
presupposes a state or event that is (or can be) durative, even though some speakers
have difficulties interpreting the following words 25:
25These examples are taken from a traditional song, which not many people know anymore.
Consultants said that the language of traditional songs is somewhat different from everyday
speech. Possibly, the examples in (105) are not very good representatives of what is and what is
not possible in the language.","[138, 139, 140]"

                  low       Q                 aSyllable structure is (C)V(C), with a number of restrictions on which consonants
can be in the coda (cf. section 2.3.1). Morphophonological processes include
lenition (restricted to /k/), assimilation (mostly of consonants), elision (mostly
vowels), and gemination (both vowels and consonants). Stress assignment is more
complex. Yurakaré feet are iambic, counted from left to right; primary stress is
assigned to the rightmost dominant node and the final syllable is extrametrical.
However, there are affixes that bear their own prosodic information. Some affixes
attract (secondary or primary) stress, while yet others avoid being stressed. I call
the former stress‐attracting and the latter stress‐avoiding morphemes. Apart from
these two types of affixes, there are also prosodically neutral affixes and
diacritically marked roots.
  Morphologically, Yurakaré can be characterized as an agglutinating language on
the scale of fusion, and fairly polysynthetic on the synthesis index.(1)   ti‐ma‐y‐mala‐m=chi             ku‐ta‐ø=ya
      1SG‐3PL‐PO‐go.SG‐IMP.SG=IGN 3SG.CO‐say‐3=NVR
      ‘Go and get them for me, she said to him.’ (OR‐19MA‐9)Verbs are usually morphologically complex, without much fusion. This can be
observed in example (1), where three participants are marked on the verb (ti‐ for
first person singular, ma‐ for third person plural object, and ‐m for second person
singular subject, as well as an applicative marker y‐ specifying the role of the third
person plural object (purposive). The ignorative marker is cliticized onto the verb.
The fact that this utterance in itself is a grammatically correct and complete
sentence illustrates the polysynthetic character of the morphology. There is no
incorporation of lexical items, however. Morpheme boundaries are generally
easily separable in Yurakaré and there is often a one‐form‐one‐meaning
correspondence. There is some fusion, however. As can be seen in example (1),
there is fusion of the categories person and number in cross‐referencing affixes,
and sometimes there is also fusion of grammatical relation markers with person
and number, as is the case with ku‐ in kutaya. In the case of the imperative there is
fusion of ‘imperative’ and number.
  Yurakaré distinguishes seven wordclasses: nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs,
ideophones, interjections and clitics. The last three may possibly be subsumed
under the higher‐level category of particles.","[23, 24]"

Verbal agreement, voice & valency
  The beneficiary reading of the direct object can be observed in the following
instances:(23) a    ti‐n‐dula‐ø        ti‐sibë
          1SG‐IO‐do;make‐3 1SG‐house
          ‘He made me my house.’ [RF‐16MA‐12]
      b   ti‐n‐ewe‐ø      ti‐sibë=y
          1SG‐IO‐sweep‐3 1SG‐house=LOC
          ‘He swept my house for me.’ [MH‐7MA‐3]
      c   ti‐n‐tëptë‐ø    ti‐bëshë
          1SG‐IO‐wash‐3   1SG‐entity 6
          ‘She washed my clothes for me.’ [FL‐10MA‐2]Verbs denoting states, processes or achievements also often carry this applicative. The
indirect object denotes the person that benefits from the state of affairs that has arisen:(24) a    ti‐n‐duta‐ø      ayma
          1SG‐IO‐burn‐3 fire
          ‘The fire is burning (after I prepared it).’ [AA‐17MA‐2]
      b   ti‐n‐kula‐ø      ti‐chata
          1SG‐IO‐boil‐3 1SG‐food
          ‘My meal is boiling.’ [FP‐16MA‐15]
      c   ti‐n‐sa‐ø=naja         ti‐sawata
          1SG‐IO‐finish‐3=DSC 1SG‐work
          ‘My work is done.’ [VP‐22MA‐8]
      d   nij      ti‐n‐suwita‐ø          ti‐ballata
          NEG      1SG‐IO‐come.up‐3       1SG‐plant.seed
          ‘My plants are not coming up.’ [FL‐10MA‐2]In all of the examples in (24) the indirect object profits somehow from the coming
about of a state. This benefit often has to do with the fact that the indirect object is the
possessor of one of the core participants, a construction known as external possession.
Core instances of external possession are described as “constructions in which a
semantic possessor‐possessum relation is expressed by coding the possessor as a core
grammatical relation of the verb and in a constituent separate from that which contains
the possessum” (Payne & Barshi 1999:3). Note that we are not dealing with possessor
raising here, since the possessor may still be marked on the noun, as is the case in
(24)b‐d.
  The indirect object can sometimes also mark a detrimentally affected dative of
interest:
6Bëshëë (which loses its final vowel when prefixed with a singular possessive prefix) has a
rather vague meaning, but it is often interpreted as ‘clothing’, sometimes ‘game’ for hunting.","[169, 170]"

Verbal agreement, voice & valency
5.2.8 Combinations of head‐marked arguments
There can be maximally three arguments encoded on the verb. One of these is always
the subject (with possibly the exception of a few experiencer verbs, as discussed
above), the other two can differ. Direct object can be combined with the cooperative
object, indirect object and affected object:Direct object & cooperative object(56) ku‐ma‐weshwe‐y
     3SG.CO‐3PL‐scrape‐1SG.S
     ‘I help him scraping them.’ [FP‐14MA‐20]Direct object & indirect object(57) ti‐ma‐n‐kaya‐ma

     1SG‐3PL‐AFO‐eat‐3     1SG‐fish=PL     1SG‐pet    dog:PL
     ‘My dogs ate my fish on me.’ [FL‐13MA‐9]In all three examples the marker referring to the direct object comes in between the
applicative marker and the cross referencing suffix associated with that applicative
marker:(59) position      2   ‐      1      ‐   0
                   CO ‐       DO     ‐   root
                   IO
                   AFOThe comitative object can also be combined with other applicative objects. In these
combinations, it behaves like a direct object as far as placement is concerned: before the
applicative marker, after the cross‐referencing prefix associated with that applicative
marker.","[180, 181, 182]"

The clause
marked by the fact that subject agreement and TMA marking are not present on
the deranked predicate.
  Subordinate forms with =ya are also deranked; they show no subject agreement
and in their marking of TMA distinctions they are dependent on the main
predicate. There are also independent clauses marked with =ya. In those
circumstances =ya indicates non‐veridical modality (cf. section 7.1.1).
  The column under =ja has two ‘+’‐values. With this I mean that there are both
balanced and deranked constructions marked with =ja. I will discuss the relevant
conditions in 8.2.3 below.
  Clauses marked with =ti have the full range of possibilities for marking TMA
and person marking. The difference with the balanced versions of =ja‐marked
clauses is that the =ja clauses must have the same subject as the main predicate 14,
while =ti marked clauses normally have a subject different from that of the main
predicate. Moreover, =ti is the only subordinating morpheme that can be further
specified by means of a postposition (cf. section 8.2.4).
  In the last column of Table 51, there is an unmarked, balanced combination of
clauses. This means that the combined predicates each have the full range of
possibilities of person marking and TMA‐marking. The meaning of the
combination can be specified by means of an independent word. Most of these
constructions are coordinated.
  The five strategies mentioned in Table 51 form a continuum: from left to right
the grammatical integration with the main predicate is increasingly lower.
According to Givón (2001b:40), “the stronger the semantic bond between the two
events, the more extensive will be the syntactic integration of the two clauses into
a single though complex clause”. This means that a decline of grammatical
coherence should coincide with a decrease of semantic coherence with the main
predicate.
  In the next sections (8.2.1‐8.2.5) I will describe the five strategies used for clause
combining in turn, indicating their formal and functional properties. In section
8.2.6 I give some alternative strategies used to encode clause combinations. In
section 8.2.7, finally, I will give an overview of the types of clause combinations
and the way they are marked.","[305, 306]"

A grammar of Yurakaré
the Macro‐Quechuan network, including inter alia nearby languages such as
Quechua, Itonama, Mosetén, and Cayuvava. Greenberg (1960, 1987) and Key
(1979) classify Yurakaré as an equatorial language, in the Andean‐Equatorial
stock, along with, among others, Cayuvava, Arawak, and Tupi languages. Suárez
(1974) links Yurakaré to Mosetén (something which had been suggested by
Metraux in a personal comment to Mason 1950:275) and Chon languages, as well
as to Pano‐Tacanan in a stock he calls Macro‐Pano‐Tacanan.
  All authors that have considered Yurakaré in their classification base their
proposals on La Cueva (1893), which is a rich source, but not rich enough to justify
these classifications (cf. Suárez 1974:137‐138). Secondly, the correspondences they
find are not overwhelming, as confirmed by Campbell (1997:192) and Adelaar
with Muysken (2004:27‐29). Using a word list with 133 items, Greenberg (1987)
only finds 22 correlates for Yurakaré, some of which are rather far off from their
cognate examples both formally and notionally. The highest number of lexical
correlations that Suárez (1974) finds for Yurakaré is with Tacana (14 out of 100 ‐ cf.
Suárez 1974:138). He also finds some systematic correspondences in the
pronominal system, some grammatical categories and phonology, but these are
sometimes due to errors in La Cueva’s grammar (e.g. causative ma‐, focus marker ‐
ya, negator chama).
  In the light of these controversies, it is best to regard Yurakaré as an unclassified
language, for which convincing evidence has not (yet) been found to classify it
with (an)other language(s) in a larger group. Hopefully this grammar will
contribute to shed some more light on this issue.","[22, 23]"
"A number of examples will serve to illustrate the characteristics mentioned here:(45) a       l‐ati        chitta      mala‐ø=ja      latijsha ma‐bëbë‐ni‐ø        a‐wishwi=w

             1SG‐IO‐throw.SG go.SG‐JUS‐3 salt 3SG.CO‐say‐3=NVR
             ‘“Maybe he gets caught by the rain so that he must return, so that he gives me, so
             that he leaves me salt”, she said.’ (AR‐8MI‐82)
       c     pa‐n‐kokko           bata‐y         ana      ropa
             2PL‐IO‐throw.PL      leave‐1SG.S DEM         clothing
             I will leave you these clothes.’ (AY‐2NC‐9)The examples in (45), are all of the same type, combining the verb chitta/kokko 15 ‘to
throw’ with a movement verb. In (45)a, the clausal marker =ja (cf. section 8.2.3) is
shared by the two verbs chitta and mala, i.e. the combination of verbs is marked for
subordination, not just one of them. In (45)b we can see that the two verbs share
the jussive marker ‐cha, which is the modality for the combination of verbs, but
only marked on the second verb. The cross reference + applicative prefixes ti‐n‐ in
15This verb has a suppletive stem which changes according to the number of objects (cf.
section 6.2.2)                                               292
The clause
(45)b and pa‐n‐ (45)c are marked on the dependent verb. Apparently, dependent
verbs of this type can be marked for object agreement, but not for subject
agreement. This latter point can be seen in (45)c, where the subject agreement
marker ‐y for first person singular is only found on the rightmost verb; the
examples in (45)a‐b seem to have the following structure.(46) [[chitta]vp[mala]vp subject]sThe examples in (45) denote two highly integrated events that share subject and
TMA. In (45)c, the fact that we can have another verb than mala/bali ‘to go’ shows
that we are not dealing with a frozen expression. The construction in (45) looks
most like a serial verb construction, cf. Sebba 1987: 86‐87, who mentions shared
subject, TMA, polarity, as well as simultaneity or consecutivity of the two events
as generally accepted characteristics of serial verb constructions.
  Simultaneous action can also be indicated with a serial verb construction,
though this is less common, and the examples are not very clear:(47) a       pelota     otto      mala‐ø sibbë         inele=jsha
             ball       go.out go.SG‐3 house           inside‐ABL
             ‘The ball rolled out of the house.’ [FR‐PC]
      b      i‐gora       mala‐m=la=yu
             VBL‐cap      go.SG‐2SG.S=VAL=EXPR.F
             ‘You did go with your cap!’ (DV‐14MA‐2)
      c      ta‐n‐dyërërë 16      chichi‐tu        achittu=chi
             1PL‐IO‐converse      cross.PL‐1PL.S other.side=DIR
             ‘While talking we crossed the river to the other side.’[FA‐24MA‐16]Syntactically, (47)a and c are difficult to distinguish from coordinate clauses
without overt marking (cf. 8.2.5), since there is no overt person or TMA inflection.
They can be distinguished by the fact that they are pronounced within a single
intonation phrase. In (47)b, there is overt person marking. Here we see that the
subject is indeed shared: igora ‘have, carry, wear a cap’ would have person
marking in other circumstances, but here it does not since it shares the subject
with mala ‘go’. I have found only instances of this particular construction where
the rightmost members are movement verbs.
  The rightmost verb in these constructions takes its own object marking:
16The verb dyërërë has deviant person marking; the person conversing is indicated as an
indirect object. Apparently, it still has to be expressed since it is not a subject syntactically,
cf also the constructions discussed below in this section.","[307, 308]"

3.2.5 Cliticization
Yurakaré has a number of clitics of different types in the nominal as well as the
verbal domain. The term clitics has been used to describe distinct phenomena (cf.
Halpern 1989:101). It is therefore important to define clitics in a particular
language.
  Clitics have to be distinguished from independent words on the one hand and
from affixes on the other. The main characteristic that sets clitics apart from
independent words in Yurakaré is that with combinations of two independent
words, each has primary stress, while combinations of a word with one or more
clitics have only one stress peak.(41) a    li-ma-ujwa-ni-jti-ø           na     yee=w
          DEL‐3PL‐look.at‐INTL‐HAB‐3 DEM       woman=PL
          ‘He was going to look at those women.’ (AR‐8MI‐61)
      b   a‐ense‐jti=w=ya           ana    yee=w
          INC‐drink‐HAB=PL=NVR DEM         woman=PL
          ‘These women started drinking’ (AR‐8MI‐61)The opposition is between the two noun phrases na yeew and ana yeew. Where the
former has only one stressed syllable (indicated in the example with italics), the
latter has two. Moreover, the morpheme na violates the requirement that a word
have minimally two syllables. Na, then, does not meet the requirements of
wordhood in Yurakaré on two accounts. Since it is furthermore not found in
isolation in this reduced form, and it is phonologically dependent I consider it to
be a clitic.
  Clitics can also be distinguished from independent words on the grounds that
there are phonological processes between stems and clitics, which we generally do
not find between words. One such process is vowel sandhi:
                                           61
A grammar of Yurakaré
(42) a   inele elli
         inside earth:LOC
         ‘inside the ground.’ (AR‐3NC‐1)
     b   a‐bontu
         3SG.P‐son:PL
         ‘her sons’ (OR‐19MA‐29)In (42)a, the enclitic =y has fused with the final vowel of elle ‘earth’, and in (42)b,
the plural enclitic =w has fused with the final vowel /o/ of bonto ‘son’.
  Elision and subsequent resyllabification are processes that occur only within,
and not in between words. However, between clitics and words and between two
clitics these processes do take place:(43) a   l‐achama=sh (underlying: l‐achama=jsha)
         REF‐be.like.that=ABL
         ‘nevertheless’ (OR‐19MA‐10)
     b   a‐dujnë=nna (underlying: a‐dujnë=tina)
         3SG.P‐game=COM
         ‘with his game’ (OR‐20MA‐8)
     c   otto‐ø=lam=naja (underlying: otto‐ø=laba=naja)
         go.out‐3=SBJ=DSC
         ‘It may have come out now.’ (OR‐20MA‐2)In (43)a, the enclitic =jsha ‘ablative’ has been reduced to =sh and is the coda
consonant of the final syllable of the stem. In (43)b the enclitic =tina loses its first
syllable, which is compensated by lengthening. In (43)c finally, the enclitic =laba is
reduced to =lam, thus forming a heavy syllable in stead of two light ones.
Yet another phonological process that does not take place between two words, but
does between a clitic and a word, is place assimilation:(44) a   an titanti     [AntitAnti]   ‘this face of mine’   (FA‐6MA‐5)
     b   an kummë       [ANkum˘Q]     ‘this tree’           (OR‐20MA‐2)
     c   an puyni       [Ampujni]     ‘this sun’            (OR‐19MA‐29)
     d   an yarru       [A¯jar˘u]     ‘this chicha’         (OR‐19MA‐30)In all of these examples, the nasal assimilates in place to the next vowel 10. Note
that in examples (44)b and d, the proclitic an can be contrasted with the possessive
10Since words generally do not end in a consonant in Yurakaré, the situation of a nasal
final consonant does not occur very often. I have found one example: a‐embarkashon
palantashon ‘his ship, plantation’ (OR‐20MA‐3) where there is no place assimilation.
However, there is a slight pause between the two words which makes it dubious as a
counterexample, moreover these are loan words.","[76, 77]"
