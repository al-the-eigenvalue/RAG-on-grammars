"   The orders:     Subject-Verb-Object (SVO)
     Verb-Subject-Object (VSO)also occur, but with less frequency. The order SVO is used speci-
fically to place greater emphasis on the subject. The VSO order is
rare except when the object is ""heavy"", i.e. when it contains a
relative clause or a coordinate noun phrase. In this way Pipil
conforms to the word-order universal that has been postulated for
VOS languages that a ""heavy"" object is not permitted and is usually
shifted to the end, giving VSO with heavy objects as a very common
104corollary order in basically VOS languages (cf. Campbell and Mithun
1981).
   The following are examples of other orders of transitive verb
sentences which have both an overt sujbect and object. The first
two illustrate VSO w i t h ""heavy"" objects. The third and fourth are
cases of VSO with the object bearing emphasis. The final two are
SVO sentences in which the subject is emphasized.","[117, 118]"
"      The most common neutral order for transitive sentences is:         Verb-Object-Subject (VOS)
                                                                103
VOS order is taken as basic because it occurs with the greatest
frequency in texts and conversation, and it is the only order for
transitive sentences which is neutral with respect to focus and
emphasis (see below). This is a relatively rare order in the
world's languages and deviates from the VSO basic order of
Classical Nahuatl and most other extant Nahua dialects. Since
neighboring Xincan and Mayan languages have VOS basic order, one
wonders whether Pipil has been influenced by these in any way (cf.
Campbell 1978).
   A few examples of transitive verbs with both subject and object
are:    1) ki-ta:lih ne i-chaketah ne ta:ka-tsin. (N-23)
    it-place the his-jacket the man-DIMIN.
    ""The little man put down his jacket.""    2) mitsin-maka-tuk ne konse:hoh ne chimpe. (N-121)
    you pl.-give-PERF the advice the youngest son.
    ""The youngest son has given you (pi.) the advice.    3) kin-maka-k pwestoh ne prínsipeh ne se:yuk
    pih-pi:pil-met. (R-56)
    them-give-PRET office the prince the other PL-boy-PL.
    ""The prince gave the other boys (a) position.""    4) ki-chih-ke-t ne ti:-t ne pipil-tsi-tsín. (C)
    it-make-PRET-PL the fire-ABSOL the boy-PL-DIMIN.
    ""The boys made the fire"".    5) ki-miktih ne wa:kax ne ta:ka-t. (C)
    it-kill the cow the man-ABSOL.
    ""The man killed the cow.""","[116, 117]"

              DedicationTo my Pipil teachers, helpers, and friends.
                            Acknowledgements     I owe a debt of gratitute to many for financial, intellectual, and moral support. I
thank the National Science Foundation and the State University of New York Research
Foundation for grants which supported my fieldwork and investigations in El Salvador. I
am also grateful to the Instituto de Investigaciones Filológicas of the Universidad Nacio-
nal Autónoma de México for support which allowed me to complete some of the histori-
cal aspects of this study and to write it up.
    I wish to thank Maria Esperanza Aguilar de Smith-Stark for much help with Salvado-
ran Spanish from the Pipil area. Claudia Parodi also assisted me with Spanish and in the
initial version of this manuscript (which was written in Spanish, but converted to English
for this publication). While Una Canger did not see the manuscript of this book before
publication, discussions with her helped me in many ways to improve both the content
and its organization.
     Above all, I wish to extend my deep appreciation to my Pipil teachers and consul-
tants, who shared their language with me. I hope that this work will some day in some
way come to be of some benefit to them.

                         Introduction
0. Introduction   The native language of western El Salvador, the subject of this
book, is known in the linguistic literature as Pipil, although its
speakers call it na:wat in the language itself and Nahuate in
Spanish. Here it is called Pipil because this usage is so strongly
entrenched in the scientific literature that it could not easily be
changed. Nevertheless, it is to be hoped that Na:wat (Nahuate) may
gain more general acceptance in honor of and in deference to its
speakers.   This book, then, presents a description of this
language.
   This chapter is concerned with the present and past geographical
distribution of Pipil, its history to the extent that it is known,
its genetic classification, and its dialects. The following three
chapters present a description of the language's structure: its
phonology (chapter 2), its lexical categories and morphology (chap-
ter 3), and its syntax (chapter A). Chapter 5 contains the Pipil-
Spanish-English dictionary representing the two main dialects,
Cuisnahuat (C) and Santo Domingo de G u z m á n (SD), with occasional
forms from other dialects.       Chapter 6 is the Spanish-Pipil
dictionary. Chapter 7 contains folkloric texts accompanied by a
morpheme-by-morpheme analysis and translation in Spanish and a more
flowing English narrative translation. Many of the examples cited
in other chapters are taken from these texts, which are coded with
a letter to identify the narrative involved and a number which
refers to the line within the text. The appendices contain addi-
tional historical information. Appendix 1 compares Pipil in detail
with other southern varieties of Nahua in order to determine
precisely its relationship to them. Appendix 2 solves the contro-
versial question concerning the Nahua of central Guatemala, which
have often been assumed to be Pipil but w h i c h turn out to be in
origin post-Conquest and from central Mexico.
   The purpose of this book, then, is to present a basic reference
work on Pipil, a sort of ""handbook"" of the language.

"   4.1.1. Word order conclusions. To summarize and complete the
picture, Pipil has the word orders:   (1) i.v.-S (basic)
   (2) t.v.-O-S (basic)
   (3) V-S-0 (with ""heavy"" objects;object emphasis)
   (4) S-V-0 (subject emphasis)
   (5) t.v.-S (variant of (2), with object pronominal prefix)
   (6) V-0 (variant of (2), with subject pronominal prefix)
   (7) Pron.S-V(-O) (basic when subject is an independent
           pronoun)
   (8) S-0-Complement (basic; subject may be a noun or
           independent pronoun, complement may be noun or
          adjective)
   (9) Noun Phrase (NP): (Dem)(Adj.)N    (Dem = demonstrative)
           (for examples, cf. chapter 7, texts)
   (10) Verb Phrase (VP): (Adv.) i.v. / t.v. (Adv)(0).
           (Cf. chapter 7, texts, for examples.)   4.1.2. Pronominal indirect objects. As indicated in section
3.2.3, pronominal object prefixes function most often to indicate
direct objects, but signal indirect objects as well. In either
case, the verb may bear only one object prefix. In the case of
indirect pronominal objects, there is often an independent noun
phrase direct object or clear contextual clues as to the pronoun's
role with respect to the verb. It may be that the indirect object
function of these pronominal affixes has been influenced by
Spanish, which like English has the same pronominal forms for both
indirect and direct objects in many cases, e.g. mje pegó ""he hit
me"", me di6 el libro ""he gave me the book"". In cases where both
the direct and indirect object are pronominal, it is usually the
indirect object that is marked on the verb, with the direct object
signaled as a full independent pronoun (cf. 3.5.2). One possible
interpretation of this is that animate cases are given priority,
since usually the indirect objects are animate.   Some examples of
pronominal prefixes as markers of indirect objects are:
110      1) nech-ahkaw-ilih-ke-t tumin.
      me-leave-APPLIC-PRET-PL money.
      ""They left me (the) money.""      2) ni-yu ni-mitsin-raaka se: pwestoh. (R-54)
      I-go I-you pi.-give a position.
      ""I am going to give you (pl.) a position.""      3) nech-ilwia.
      me-tell.
      ""(She) tells me.""      4) kin-maka-k      pwestoh  ne    prinsipeh    ne    seryuk
      pih-pi:pil-raet. (R-56)
      them-give-PRET position the prince the other PL-boy-PL.
      ""The prince gave (to them) the other boys (a) position.      5) ne i-ixwiyu-wan te:-ya su kin-maka ne takwal. (N-83)
      the her-grandchild-POSS PL no-now no them-give the food.
      ""She no longer gives her grandchildren the food.""      6) ki-raaka-ke-t ti:-t ne kal. (N-139)
      it-give-PRET-PL fire-ABSOL the house.
      ""They set the house on fire.""      7) naha propyo ne chu:le-t nech-chiw-tuk kontár. (A-29)
      I self the old man-ABSOL me-do-PERF tell.
      ""(To) me myself the old m a n has told me (it)."" = ""The old
      man has told (it to) me myself.""","[123, 124]"

4.1. Word order      In traditional parlance i t would be said that P i p i l word order
i s "" r e l a t i v e l y f r e e "" ; in the case of P i p i l this means that i t i s
pragmatically determined, depending on focus and on topic-comment
arrangements. F i r s t the order of s e n t e n t i a l elements in simple
declarative sentences w i l l be described, then these orders w i l l be
illustrated with examples. I t i s to be kept in mind that the verb
bears pronominal a f f i x e s which c r o s s - r e f e r e n c e subjects and ob-
j e c t s , and when these are pronominal, the sentence may lack any
other indication of these arguments, relying solely on the subject
and object pronominal p r e f i x e s to signal these r o l e s . The most
natural, least marked order for intransitive sentences i s :     Verb-Subject (VS)
102      Example sentences with Intransitive Verb and its subject are:       1) ya:h-ki ka-dentroh ne ta:ka-tsin. (N-23)
       go-PRET in-inside the man-DIMIN.
       ""The little man went inside.""       2) mu-tamu:ta ne tsuntekuma-t. (N-33)
       REFLEX-throw the skull.
       ""The skull throws itself.""       3) miki-k ne raasa:-t. (N-37)
       die-PRET the deer.
       ""The deer died.""       4) al fin de tanto wa:ki-k ne masa:-t. (N-43)
       In the end dry-PRET the deer.
       ""In the end the deer dried up.""       5) ya:h-ki ne tengerecheh. (N-127)
       go-PRET the lizard.
       ""The lizard went.""       6) mu-kwep-ki ne tengerechul. (N-129)
       REFLEX-return-PRET the lizard.
       ""The lizard returned.""       7) ni:kan naka-k ne tehitah. (N—131)
       here stay-PRET the small tile.

"   Intransitive sentences, on the other hand, rarely deviate from
the basic Verb-Subject (VS) order. The combination Verb-Object
(VO) is found often in transitive sentences in which the subject is
pronominal and hence signaled by a verb prefix. Similarly, the
order Verb-Subject (VS) also occurs in transitive sentences w h e n
the object is pronominal and marked with prefixes on the verb.
   A few examples of verb-initial transitive sentences which lack
independent subjects or objects, these being signaled by pronominal
prefixes, are:      1) VO: ki-chiw-ki ne komidah. (H-12)
      it-made-PRET the food.
      ""She made the food.""

Deletion). Other surface verb phrases occur which have two or more
verbs, corresponding to infinitives in many other languages. In
Pipil, they occur juxtaposed, but each bears the subject pronominal
prefixes. Thus, literally ""I went by to see it"" is ""I-passed I-it-

   4.19. -chiwa + Spanish infinitive. Often so-called minority
languages, spoken in the social or political setting where some
other language dominates them in power or prestige (usually in
situations involving extensive bilingualism) contain constructions
for employing directly unassimilated forms from the dominant
language. Very often this involves the native verb ""to do"" plus an
infinitive from the dominant language, as is the case of Pali forms
used in Burmese, Arabic loans in Persian, Turkish, and Urdu, and of
Chinese borrowings into Japanese, among others. In some of these
languages it is a former contact situation of dominance which has
left its reflexes, although the domination no longer exists.
Spanish verbs are employed in this way in various Mayan languages
and other Indian languages of Mesoamerica. Pipil utilizes -chiwa
""to do"" plus unassimilated Spanish infinitives , which provides
Pipil, in effect, with the richness of Spanish concepts not easily
expressed in Pipil, and allows speakers access to the prestige of
Spanish even in cases where Pipil has perfectly equivalent verbs.
It is also used frequently when the Pipil form is not readily
remembered. Since the Spanish infinitive also functions as a nomi-
nallzation, structurally it is not so strange to see it with -chiwa
""to do"", where it could be thought of as something like, e.g.
 ni-k-chiwa luchâr ""I do fighting"", i.e. ""I fight"". In this con-
struction, the tenses, aspects, pronominal subjects and objects,
reflexives, etc. are born by -chiwa and the Spanish infinitive does
not vary.   While these infinitives are not properly speaking part
of Pipil, they are presented in the examples and in the texts in
the Pipil practical orthography and not in Spanish spelling. Some
examples taken from the texts are the following; for the full
sentential contexts see these texts:   1) mu-chiw-ki proponér (H-6)
   it was proposed (cf. Sp. se propuso)   2) ki-chiw-ki desplumár (H-12)
   (she) plucked it (cf. Sp. lo desplumó)   3) mu-chiw-ke-t afihár (H-13)

               Pipil-Spanish-English Dictionary
5.0. Introduction       This dictionary covers the two P i p i l dialects which today have
the greatest number of speakers, Cuisnahuat (abbreviated (C)) and
Santo Domingo de Guzmán (signaled by (SD)). Entries are preceded
by either (C) or (SD) to identify the dialect.                      When both dialects
contain a form, the Cuisnahuat version i s l i s t e d f i r s t ( i . e . , in
alphabetical order), followed by the Santo Domingo de Guzmán form.
Material common to the two d i a l e c t s i s presented only in the
Cuisnahuat entry and not repeated f o r the Santo Domingo de Guzmán
version.            Nevertheless, when there are d i f f e r e n c e s , these are
given. Also, occasionally forms from other d i a l e c t s are l i s t e d ,
identified by the name of the dialect before the entry.
       P i p i l words are given with both a Spanish and an English gloss.
The Spanish glosses are given p r i m a r i l y in the l o c a l Spanish of
this part of El Salvador. When this d i f f e r s greatly from standard
Spanish or the variants understood in Guatemala and Mexico, a more
general Spanish translation i s also given, i f i t i s known. In some
instances, mainly in the case of names f o r of wild plants and
animals, local Spanish usage i s a l l that i s known. In such cases,
a b r i e f d e s c r i p t i o n i s given. In a few cases the meaning i s not
secure; these are marked with a question mark in parenthesis, i.e.
( ? ) . In cases where the English name of plants or animals i s not
known, i t i s simply listed with the abbreviation sp. standing f o r
""species"", e.g. ""chichipince"", bush sp. Sometimes various names or
distinct pronunciations of a single name f o r the same thing exist
in the l o c a l Spanish. In such cases, the multiple names and pro-
nunciations are listed in the glosses, with f i r s t priority given to
the names used by my consultants.
      The entries also contain morphological information which i s not
p r e d i c t a b l e or i s otherwise i r r e g u l a r .      In unclear cases, the
syntactic category of the word i s signaled by abbreviations (see
l i s t at the beginning of this book) such as t.v. 'transitive verb',
i . v . ' i n t r a n s i t i v e verb 1 , iij_ 'noun', coni., 'conjunction', e t c . In
146particular, nouns are listed with their plurals (pi.) and possessed
forms (poss.), since these are not predictable. Adjectives are
also often given with their plural forms. Similarly, verb entries
are l i s t e d in the present stems (pres.), but t h e i r p r e t e r i t e
( p r ê t . ) and perfect (perf.) forms are also c i t e d , since these, in
e f f e c t , indicate to which verb c l a s s the entry belongs. Since
these verb forms are not always predictable from knowledge of their
verb class, the actual cases provide additional information beyond
class membership. Other morphemes named in the entries, together
with t h e i r abbreviations, are t a - 'unspecified object', causative
(caus.), a p p l i c a t i v e ( a p p l i c . ) , object incorporation (incorp.),
etc. In particular i t i s important to keep in mind that reflexive
verb forms (abbreviated r . v . ) a r e l i s t e d in the d i c t i o n a r y
according to the r o o t , and not by the prefix mu- which they bear.
Thus, a verb root with both active and reflexive forms has only one
entry, but with forms signaled t.v. ( ' t r a n s i t i v e verb') and r.v.
( ' r e f l e x i v e verb'). Verbs which only appear as r e f l e x i v e s are
given with the mu- prefix, but listed alphabetically according to
the root.
      Forms with a hyphen ( - ) contain a morpheme boundary. Thus, a
hyphen appears between the elements of c e r t a i n compound words.
E n t r i e s with the hyphen at the beginning o b l i g a t o r i l y bear some
other morpheme, a p r e f i x . For example, intimately ( s o - c a l l e d
' i n a l i e n a b l y ' ) possessed nouns do not occur without a possessive
pronominal prefix; the presence of a hyphen shows this. Also, the
absolutive suffix of nouns is separated with a hyphen for greater
clarity. Morphemes which have a special shape in compounds or when
incorporated are c i t e d with t h e i r glosses in single quotes, e.g.
ku:- 'head*. When forms occur which are known only from compounds
but do not appear as such elsewhere, they are given with the gloss
in parentheses, e.g. tankwa- ('knee'). Non-lexical, grammatical
morphemes are also cited in single quotes, while other glosses are
found with no special marking or in double quotes (""..."").","[156, 157, 158, 159, 160]"
"   3 . 7 . 4 . Pronominal a f f i x e s with v e r b s . As seen above, v e r b s

which a l s o c r o s s - r e f e r e n c e f u l l or independent pronoun, noun, and
noun-phrase s u b j e c t s .         These were presented in section 3.2). Here
we turn to the other pronominal a f f i x e s that occur with verbs.
                                                                 75     3.7.4.1. 'Reflexive' (mu-). By the notion ""reflexive"" one does
not usually understand a pronominal form, but the 'reflexive'
m o r p h e m e s in Nahua have typically been treated as pronominal
because in central Mexican dialects they pattern with other prono-
minal prefixes and vary according to person. The 'reflexive'
morpheme of Pipil is mu- with all persons. Its phonological shape
is normally mu in all contexts, including before vowels, where it
is phonetically (muw-) alternating freely with (mw-) is faster
speech. However, there are a few prevocalic cases where it is
simply m - (see 2.2). Some of these appear to have the m - fused as
part of the root and it is no longer recognized as the historical
reflexive that lies behind it. Nevertheless, in these cases there
exist other derivations which show the root without the otherwise
frozen reflexive.          (See below; cf. section 2.2.) Example of
preconsonantal and prevocalic 'reflexive' paradigms are:
       ni-mu-ta:lia        I sit (literally ""I place myself"")
       ti-mu-ta:lia        you (sg.) sit
       mu-ta:lia           he/she/it sits
    ti-mu-ta:lia-t   we sit
    an-mu-ta:lia-t   you (pi.) sit
    mu-ta:lia-t      they sit    ni-mu-a:paka     I wash myself
    ti-mu-a:paka     you (sg.) wash yourself
    mu-a:paka        he/she/it washes hlm-/her-/itself
    ti-mu-a:paka-t   we wash ourselves
    an-mu-a:paka-t   you (pi.) wash yourselves
    mu-a:paka-t      they wash themselvesSome additional examples of reflexive verbs are:   mu-a:pachua       to throw oneself in the water
   mu-chayuntia       to swing
   mu-i:xraimilua     to roll
   mu-i:xmu:tia       to be frightened, afraid
   mu-i:xpa:ka        to wash one's face
   mu-kxi-pa:ka       to wash one's feet
   mu-machtia          to learn (i.e. to teach oneself)
   mu-na:miktia       to get married
   mu-ne:xtia         to show oneself
   mu-sewi            to rest
   mu-tahkwiltia      to braid (one's hair)
   mu-ta:lua          to run
   mu-tapatia         to dress, change clothes
76     mu-ta: sa                 to bump into
     mu-ta:wa:ntia             to get drunk
     mu-techtia                to be sad, become sad
     mu-te:ka                  to lie down
     mu-tu :nalwia             to sun oneself
     mu-tsinta:lia             to squat
     mu-wawana                 to scratch oneselfA few examples of the prevocalic jn- allomorph, together                   with
related non-reflexive forms, are:     m-a:ltia     to bathe (oneself)            k-altia    to bathe
     m-a:wiltia   to play                       k-a:wiltia to paly it
     m-ihtutia    to dance                      k-ihtutia to dance it
     m-i:naya     to hide (oneself)             k-i:naya   to hide it
     m-ihkwani    to remove (self)              k-ihkwani to remove it
     m-isu :tia   to vomit
     m-itu:ni(ya) to sweatA few verbs which are reflexive in form have developed specialized
senses :     m u - c h i w a to grow       (from c h i w a ""tamake"")
     mu-neki         to need       (from neki ""to want"")There is one suppletive form with mu-, derived from a verb but used
as an adjective: mu-e(t)s-tuk ""seated, sitting"".
   With respect to the order of verbal prefixes, subject pronomi-
nale precede mu-, but the object pronominal prefixes and the
reflexive are mutually exclusive, both occupying the ""object""
position.    I n the f e w c a s e s of v e r b s w h i c h b e a r b o t h t h e
'reflexive* and either the (w)al- 'directional' or -el- 'mentation/
inside' (see below) prefixes, the 'reflexive' follows these, e.g.:     (w)al-mu-ne:lwia            to hurry
     el-mu-yawa                  to be nauseated(Cf. 2.2 and 3.7.6.1.)     In the dictionary (chapter 5) reflexive verbs are not listed
independently (under mu- , but rather are found under the verb root
w i t h the abbreviation r.v. to indicate that the root occurs w i t h
the reflexive morpheme.
                                                                77   3.7.4.2. ta- 'unspecified object 1 . In addition to the object
pronominal prefixes already presented, Pipil has another which is
employed to show that the (non-human) object of a transitive verb
is not specified. Verbs with this prefix, ta-, are translated with
an object ""something"" or ""to be doing"" whatever the action of the
verb is, without specifying what the object of the action is; cf.
ni-ta-hkwilua ""I a m      writing"" or ""I write (something)"" /
ni-k-ihkwilua ""I write it"". For example, ta- forms are much used
for answering the question, ""what are you doing?""; the answer might
be, for example, ni-ta-istawia ""I'm salting"".         That is, the
'unspecified object' ta- is natural in contexts where the action of
the verb is in focus and the object is of little relevance, as seen
in these forms:   ni-ta-u:ya                     I am shelling (corn)
     (cf. ni-k-u: ya ""I shell it"")
   ni-ta-ilpia                    I am tying
     (cf. ni-k-ilpia ""I tie it"")
   ni-ta-ku:taraima               I throw something
     (cf. ki-ku:tamima ""he throws it"")Some instances of verbs with ta- are:   ta-chalua        to hit, beat
   ta-chichina      to smoke
   ta-chihcha       to spit
   ta-chiya         to look
   ta-chteki        to steal (cf. k-ichteki ""to steal it"")
   ta-hkwilua       to write (cf. k-ihkwllua ""to write it"")
   ta-hseki         to toast (cf. k-ihseki ""to toast it"")
   ta-htsuma        to sew (cf. k-ihtsuma ""to sew it"")
   ta-ihxihxi: ma   to scrape

     ta-su:ma         to fight, hit
     ta-wiya          to shell (corn)   3.7.4.2.1.  Non-productive and special ta- forms.      In a few
verbs the ta- prefix is no longer optional, but has become a frozen
part of the verb root. Normally, verbs with ta- as the unspecified
object do not permit the simultaneous occurrence of k(i)~, the
'third person singular pronominal object 1 prefix. However, the
verbs with frozen ta- do take the k(i)~ object marker.     In other
cases the optional ta- prefix is added, but either with specialized
semantic senses or irregular phonological outcomes.            Some
instances of both kinds are:     tah-a:na         to pick up (cf. a:na ""to pick up"")
     ta-chpa:na (C)   to sweep (cf. uchpa:na ""to sweep"";
         (t-uchpa:na (SD); normally only initial _i before two conso-
         nants is lost with ta-)
     takwi:ka         to sing (cf. ni-k-takwi;ka ""I sing it"")
     tahkwiltia        to braid (cf. ni-k-tahkwiltia ""I braid it;cf.

with iterative verbs or with plural objects, e.g.:     tah-ta-chiya     to look a lot, to have fun
     tah-ta-ketsa     to chat (cf. ta-ketsa ""to talk"")

means ""hither"", i.e. motion toward the speaker or toward where the
action of the verb takes place. It is derived historically from
wa:lah ""to come"" ('preterite' form). The allomorph w a l - appears
only if no other prefix precedes it; otherwise, the -al- allomorph
occurs. Also, this is the only prefix before which all the subject
pronominal prefixes lose their final vowel, if they have one, e.g.:
    n-al-kl:xtia      I remove it
    t-al-ki:xtia      you (sg.) remove it
    k-al-ki:xtia      he/she/it removes it
    t-al-ki:xtia-t    we remove it
    an-al-ki:xtia-t   you (pi.) remove it
    k-al-ki:xtia-t    they remove it
Some verbs with this prefix, compared to their counterparts without
it, are:    (w)al-ahsi        to find          ahsi       to arrive
    (w)al-a:na        to bring         a:na       to pick up

ductive and few examples of it exist, but it appears to mean appro-
ximately ""perception by the senses"", that is, mental or emotional
acts, or ""inside"". It appears with verb roots, but also with other
categories as well:     el-ka:wa           to forget (ka:wa ""to leave, abandon"")
     el-mu-yawa         to be nauseated (yawa ""to turn"" (?))

     -el-tapach        liver   3.7.6.3. - a h - 'buccal'. Pipil has forms which suggest another
non-productive verbal prefix now frozen as part of the root, which
probably meant acts done w i t h the mouth, although today this
meaning is far from clear. It also occurs with some non-verbal
forms. The examples are:      ahkamacha:lua     to yawn (cf. ka:machalua (SD) ""to yawn"")
      ahka:na           to blow, fan
                                                                     83    ahketsawetsi      to fall mouth upward (i.e., on one's back;
                         cf. wetsi ""to fall"")
    ahkwe:chiwi       to sneeze (cf. kwe:chiwi ""to be insect-eaten"")
    ahnekua (t.v.)    to smell (cf. ihnekwi ""to smell"" (i.v.))
    ahpu:tsa          to belch, burp (cf. pu:tsua ""to accumulate"")
    ahwa              to bark, scold (cf. wawa- ""to bark"";
                         cf. CN wawaloa ""to bark"")
   ahwa-t             chaff (that which is blown on to rid it
                         from rice, beans, grain, etc.)
    ahwiya-k          delicious   3.7.6.4.  - i h - 'superperficial'. There is evidence of yet
another non-productive, frozen, and rare verb prefix, -ih-, which
seems to have something to do with the surface of objects. Tt also
is not limited to verbs. The examples are:    ihchiki           to scrub
    ihiya             to hate
    ihkwilua           to write (cf. kwikwil- ""colored"")

"This list shows that there are dialects w h i c h are not of the
Eastern group that have the -me-h / -me-t ending and that there are
Eastern (Isthmus) dialects which lack it (e.g. Boquiapan, Cupilco,
Tuxtlas, etc.).    It is very possible that - m e - h / - m e - t w a s the
original Proto-Nahua plural ending in pronouns, which would mean
that it represents a retention in those dialects that have it, not
a shared innovation. Therefore, these dialects could have retained
the trait regardless of their actual classification by simply not
having changed the prior existing form. In any case, its geogra-
phical distribution shows that this feature is not diagnostic for
the classification of Nahua dialects and has no direct relevance to
the position of Pipil.
   Pipil, the Sierra de Puebla, and Isthmus Nahua also share the
retention of initial      w h i c h changed to ye- in many other dia-
lects, as in, for example, e:-t(l) ""bean"" instead of ye:-t(l). But
certain other dialects also preserve e-, e.g. La Huasteca, Jalisco,
etc., and even in Classical Nahuatl e^ varied w i t h ye. The e^ is a
retention of a Proto-Nhaua characteristic; the change of       to ye-
is a relatively recent innovation. Therefore, Pipil and others
could share    irrespectively of their classification (cf. Canger
1978:8).
   These three, Pipil, Sierra de Puebla, and Isthmus Nahua, also
share another trait, the preservation of the root-final v o w e l in
the words toto(:)nik ""hot"" and xoxo:wik ""green""; cf. CN toto:nki
and xoxo:wki (Canger 1978:8). This attribute is not diagnostic
                                                                931for the classification, either, since La Huasteca Nahua also has it
and, moreover, because it represents a retention of the original
form which could be shared without any historical connection after
the split up of Proto-Nahua. The loss of the root-final vowel
represents an innovation in the dialects which underwent it. In
any case, it is also possible that the Pipil form tutu:nk-a:yu-t
""fever"" evidences the change.
   These three varieties share yet another trait; they have changed
the *tl of Proto-Nahua to _t (cf. Campbell and Langacker 1978), but
this change is so natural that it very easily could have taken
place independently, as is suggested by the fact that a number of
other dialects also share this change (cf. Canger 1980:88-9).
   Canger also pointed out that these three (Pipil, Sierra de
Puebla, and Isthmus Nahua) also tend to lose the absolutive suffix
after     (Canger 1978:13), but the circumstances of this loss vary
in each of the three and also, the same tendency is found in
certain other dialects, e.g. in Tlaxcala Nahua (Canger 1978:13).
In Pipil the absolutive has been lost completely with roots ending
in     but also it tends to be lost in other environments. For
example, one of its allomorphs, -ti, occurs after other consonants
(not -1) but is limited for the most part to monosyllabic forms,
save a few exceptions (see section 3.1.1). In Isthmus Nahua the
absolutive allomorph that occurs after final -1_ (i.e. -li) has
been lost only in polysyllabic nouns, while in Sierra de Puebla
Nahua it was lost in this same environment and also in monosyllabic
nouns with a long vowel. Had the loss of absolutive been histori-
cally shared, the only portion of it that one could assume to be
genetic would be the suppression of the allomorph after root-final
   in polysyllabic forms — but not even this small portion of it
is useful for genetic classification, given that Tlaxcala Nahua
also shares that much of the loss.
   Canger also pointed out traits shared only be Pipil and Isthmus
Nahua. These may be more important, although their significance
for genetic classification is not easily determined. Among these
she cites an Isthmus construction with nemi plus a main verb which
results in a kind of progressive: nemi ni-takwa ""I am eating"". In
Pipil this progressive construction is composed of a clear
auxiliary verb, nemi, which means ""to be"" in other contexts.
However, the constructions meaning and function in Isthmus Nahua
varies with the local dialects. For example, García de León tran-
slates it as ""go (about) doing"" (Sp. andar haciendo) in Pajapan,
Veracruz, where he describes the construction as a ""frase verbal
continuativa"":    nemi mawiltia ""anda jugango"".      El uso de esta frase
932      sustituye en mucho al uso del sufijo continuativo -tok de
      los verbos. (García de León 1976:74)Here it is composed of a verb nemi ""to walk, go"" (andar) plus main
verb (cf. CN nemi ""to live"", nehnemi ""to go, walk""). On the other
hand, Wolgemuth (1980:107) presents it as a true progressive con-
struction, e.g. nemi ni-takwa ""I am eating"". In Pipil, one might
expect a progressive construction from a verb meaning ""to be"", as
is the case in many other languages of the world, e.g. English ""I
am eating"" or Spanish ""estoy comiendo"". Moreover, Isthmus Nahua
has a progressive suffix, -tok, as do several other varieties of
Nahua, which Pipil lacks. Therefore, while Pipil and Isthmus Nahua
share a similarity in this case, it is possible that it is due to
independent innovation of the progressive construction, just as was
the case with English and Spanish, related languages which indepen-
dently developed progressives from forms of the verb ""to be"".
Other dialects also contain auxiliary constructions with nemi, but
with it postposed, e.g. mo-laluhti-nemi ""(he) goes (about) running""
(anda corriendo) in Michoacan Nahua (Beller and Beller 1979:282),
wikati-nemi ""sings habitually"" in La Huasteca Nahua (Sischo
1979:355), while Tetelcingo has an 'ambulative' construction,
-ti-nemi (Brewer 1969:46), to which CN kwala:n-ti-nemi ""to go
(around) getting angry"" (andar enojándose) may be compared. It is
also possible, however, given the greater similarity in form and
meaning, that Pipil and Isthmus Nahua share this trait due to some
common history; at this time, it is simply unclear.
   Canger's second feature shared by Pipil and Isthmus Nahua is
-pal 'possession', e.g. i-pal ""his/hers/its"", no-pal / nu-pal
""mine"", etc. Other dialects have a cognate relational noun -pal,
but generally with the basic meaning of ""by, with, near, by means
of, for"". However, these also have contexts with a possessive
sense, e.g. CN te:-pal ""someone's"" (ajeno). At the same time,
Pipil has contexts with the meaning ""by, for"", e.g. pal ""by, for,
in order to"" (conjunction), ""of, from, by"" (possessive,
directional). It is possible that Pipil and Isthmus Nahua have
innovated together the basic sense of possession, but this is by no
means clear.
   Finally, Canger (1978:14) presented certain lexical items shared
by Pipil and Isthmus Nahua, but these are not shared exclusively by
these two varieties (nor by these plus Sierra de Puebla Nahua).
For example, koyame-t / kuyame-t ""pig"" is found in Pipil, Isthmus
Nahua, Michoacan, and Quetzalapa; others tend to have pitso-t(l).
The form teksis-t(l)i ""egg"" is found in Pipil,      Isthmus,    and
La   Huasteca;    others   have totol-te- t(l). tle-tl. tli-tl, or
                                                                933tlexuch-tli.
   In sum, these similarities may suggest a possible closer genetic
connection between Pipil and Isthmus Nahua (and perhaps these two
with the Sierra de Puebla), but their genetic significance is
inconclusive and Pipil's striking differences (cited above) should
be kept in mind.","[946, 947, 948, 949]"

""instrumental prefixes"", but much less extensively than some other
Uto-Aztecan languages. The instrumental prefix is basically an
incorporated noun, usually a body-part term, w h i c h semantically
signals the instrument by which the action of the verb is realized.
These have been called instrumental prefixes because in some lan-
guages the incorporated elements appear in a changed, abbreviated
form s o m e w h a t different from the full nouns from w h i c h they are
derived. (Pipil also has such changed forms, but with incorporated
objects, rather than these instrumental f o r m s (see below).) The
few examples appear to be frozen; they are:     1) tan-kwa             to bite (tan- ""tooth"", kwa ""to eat"")
     2) mu-tankwa-ketsa     to kneel (tankwa ('knee'), ketsa
                              ""to stand"")
     3) ikxi-ahsi           to reach, catch up with (ikxi
                              ""foot"", ahsi to ""arrive, find"")
     4) kwa:ch-ki:xtia      to strain, sift (kwa:ch- ""cloth"",
                              ki:xtia ""to take out"")
     5) te-tsikwini         to cross the river on rocks (te-
                              ""rock"", tsikwini ""to jump"")
     6) mu-tu:nal-tatia     to sun (tu:nal ""sun"", tatia ""to burn"")
                                                                 97   3.7.10.3. Object incorporation. Like other Uto-Aztecan and many
native American languages, Nahua varieties can incorporate an ob-
ject noun directly into the verb. Such incorporated objects have a
generic or non-specific sense. English does not really have this
kind of incorporation, but examples such as ¿o proofread (read
proof), to babysit (sit babies), to deerhunt(?) (hunt deer), and to
barhop (hop bars) give a good idea of the construction. In Pipil
it is no longer productive and most of the forms are frozen; for
that reason, some examples were included in the section on verb
compounds (cf. 4.6.2). The most common are the cases with a body-
part term incorporated. Cases in which the incorporated element
occurs in a special form different from its independent nominal
counterpart are signaled by single quotes ('...') which otherwise
are employed to mark grammatical elements as opposed to lexical
material (marked with double quotes (""..."")).
  Some examples with regular incorporated nouns are:   a:raa-ita              to read (a:ma- ""book"", ita ""tosee"")
   ich-ma:linl (SD)     to twist string (ich ""string"", ma:lini

                          -kukul- ita ""to see"")
   kalaki               to enter (kal ""house"", (aki) ""enter"")

   mu-kal-tapa:na
                          ""house"", taparna ""to break open"")

(For more details and for other questions, see section 4.4.)   4.2.5.3. Irregular ""to be"" forms. Some irregular forms which
function as adjectives with the sense of ""to be"" are:    se:n-kak        to be together (cf. se:(η) ""one, together"")
    mu-ets-tuk (C), to be seated
     mu-es-tuk (SD)
    ihka-tuk        to be standing   A construction with   is also found in the cleft sentences (cf.
4.16); other nemi constructions include its auxiliary function in
'progressives' (see 4.20.1). (Cf. also the -ti 'inchoative'
suffix, 3.7.8.3.3.)
4.3. Non-distinct arguments   The concept of non-distinctness refers to transitive sentences
in which the subject and direct object are either coreferential or
one of these arguments (subject or direct object) is not specified.
The kinds of 'non-distinct' arguments are passives, reflexives,
impersonale, and unspecified direct-object markers (cf. Langacker
1977:46-8). Many of these forms were already considered in the
morphology (chapter 3); for 'reflexives' (-mu-) cf. 3.7.4.1, for
the 'unspecified object' markers, see 3.7.4.2. (both te:- human and
ta- nonhuman); passive verb morphology (-lu-, -ua) was treated in
3.7.8.4.
   There is also an impersonal construction formed of 'third
personal plural' verbs (i.e. with the suffix -t) where the subject
is not otherwise specified, meaning, e.g. ""fish are eaten in
Japan"", that is equivalent to English ""they"" in ""they eat fish in
Japan"". For example:    1) nech-tawilih-ke-t ne pe:lu.
    me-give-PRET-PL the dog.
    ""They gave me the dog."" - ""I was given the dog.""   2) de mala swerte ki-mu:tia-t.

   was frightened.""

"     3.7.8.4. 'Passives' (-1_, - l u , - l w - , and -ua). Although these
passive suffixes are no longer productive, Pipil has many passive
verbs of this kind derived from actives. The most common type has
-lu. From this comes the             suffix which derives nouns from pas-
sive verbs (e.g. ta-kwa-1 ""food"", ta- 'something' + k w a ""to eat"" +
— ' p a s s i v e nominalization'; literally ""something that is eaten"";
cf. section 3.1.3.10). The - u a class of passive verbs is smaller.
W i t h this suffix, preceding ¿ and Jts are palatalized to x_ and £ h
respectively (cf. section 2.2). Verbs derived from others with
these suffixes have meanings that are either passive or intransi-
tive reflexive. Some examples are:    ahkamacha:lua      to yawn (cf. kamachal ""jaw"")
    (i)hkwilua        to write
90     i :xpanua        to place before (cf. i:xpan ""before"")
     i :xtapachua     to turn over (cf. tapach ""shell"")
     kimilua          to wrap (cf. kimil ""bundle"")
     kwah-kwalu       to be exhausted (cf. kwa ""to eat"")
     kwalu            to be insect-infested (cf. kwa ""to eat"")
     kwalu me:ts-ti   for the moon to eclipse (cf. kwalu)
     pahsulua         for hair to be mussed (cf. pahsul ""nest"")
     pitsakua         to make thinner (cf. pitsa(:wa)k ""thin""
     pixua            to lay eggs (cf. piya ""to have"" (?))
     sa:lúa           to stick, glue (cf. sasa:lik ""sticky"")
     taswilua         to light 9cf. ta:wil ""light"")
     taxkalua         to make tortillas (cf. taxkal ""rigua"")
     tsapalua         to get down (cf. tsapa-tsin ""short"")
     tsitsinua        to break into pieces (cf. tsin ""base""?)
     mu-tsukulua      to squat (cf. tsukul ""lump"")
     ululua           to roll (cf. ulul-nah ""round"")   3.7.8.5. 'Applicatives' (-lia (and -iltia)). In Nahua studies,
'applicative' is the traditional name for the suffix w h i c h indi-
cates that the verb permits three arguments, subject, direct o b -
ject, and indirect object, with the meaning ""someone (subject) does
(verb) something (direct object) for or against someone (indirect
object, 'applicative' suffix). The basic form of the 'applicative'
suffix is -lia, but like the passive, this, too, historically
contained an i. which sometimes causes the root vowel to change to i
and palatalizes /s/ and /ts/ to /x/ and /ch/, respectively. S o m e
examples are:     kuwilia         to buy for (kuwa ""to buy"")
     kwepilia         to return something to someone (kwepa
                        ""to return"")
     pahpa:kilia      to laugh at (pa:ki ""to laugh"")
     tapatilia        to change something for someone (pati
                        ""to change"")
     petstilia        to undress someone (mu-petstia ""to undress"")
     takwi:kalia      to sing for (takwi:ka ""to sing"")
     mu-tate:muwilia to look for something for someone
                        te:mua ""to look for"")
     tepe:wilia       to pile on for (tepe:wa ""to pile"")
     tetilia          to tie tight on (tete-k ""tight"")
                                                                  91
   tsahtsalia      to shout to, to call someone something
                      (tsahtsi ""to shout"")
   wi:kilia        to owe someone something (wi:ka ""to take"")A variant form of the 'applicative', -ltia. occurs with a few
verbs; -lwia in one case:   takwiltia      to loan someone something (takwi ""to borrow"")
   tane:wiltia     to lend (tane:wi ""to borrow"")
   takwi:kalwia    to sing something for someone (takwi:ka
                     ""to sing"")   3.7.8.6. 'Diffusion* verbs (-ni/-na/-nia). The verbs with the
suffixes -ni (intransitive) and -nia/-na (transitive) have a common
semantic trait, although it is difficult to specify that feature
clearly. Many of these verbs refer to sounds, others to breaking
or tearing, and still others to the extension or diffusion of
something. Perhaps it is not wholly felicitous to call these all
'diffusion' verbs, but if w e stretch the notion of diffusion is
stretched to include sounds (which, of course, do diffuse), and if
then breaking and tearing are further placed among the verbs of
sound (given that sound is produced in such actions), perhaps we
can speak of 'diffusion' verbs without misinterpretation. Examples
of these are:  ahka:na          to blow, fan pusu: ni         to foam
  chahchakwa:ni    to mash       sulu:ni         to swell

Uto-Aztecan has eight branches or subgroups:    UTO-AZTECAN
    I. Numic (Plateau Shoshone)
       1. Mono (Monachi), Paviotso
          2. Panamint, Shoshone

    VI. Taracahitic
          1. Tarahumara
          2. Cahita, Varihio (Guarihio)
          3. Opata
    VII. Cora-Huichol (Corachol)

    VIII. Nahua (Aztecan, Nahuatlan)
         1. +Pochutec
         2. Pipil         3. Core Nahua (all other Nahua varieties)       Note: + = extinct.
   Many proposals exist for higher-order, more inclusive groupings,
and there is now a near consensus that the family first split into
two branches, Northern Uto-Aztecan (which includes groups I-IV
here) and Southern Uto-Aztecan (groups V-VIII). More controversial
proposals have bunched Takic, Numic, and TUbatulabal in a proposed
Shoshonean group and have linked P i m a n and Taracahitic, and at
times Cora-Huichol and Nahua also, in a group called Sonoran.
Miller's (1984) recent classification is intermediate to these:

i s used here to r e f e r t o any v a r i e t y , be i t a d i a l e c t or indepen-
dent language, of the Nahua subgroup. This term i s purposefully
n o n s p e c i f i c to avoid the confusion t h a t other names used in the
l i t e r a t u r e have produced. I t i s important to explain some of these
terms in order to unravel some of this confusion.
       North American linguists tend to speak of the ""Aztec"" language.
This, however, i s unclear because the language i s not a d i r e c t
r e f l e c t i o n of Aztec culture, since i t was spoken contemporaneously
a l s o by non-Aztecs ( e . g . the T l a x c a l a n s ) . Other names which have
been used in reference to v a r i e t i e s of Nahua are: Nahuatl, Nahuat,
Nahuate (Naguate), Mejicano (Mexicano), Mejicano Corrupto (Corrupt
Mexican), P i p i l Nicarao, e t c .          Pochutec of Oaxaca (now e x t i n c t ,
see Boas 1917) i s the most divergent language of the subgroup.
While the case i s l e s s c l e a r , I believe that Central American Pipil
should also be considered a d i s t i n c t language, but more similar to
other v a r i e t i e s than Pochutec i s .      All others are considered dia-
l e c t s of a s i n g l e language, c a l l e d here ""Core Nahua"".         (For more
d e t a i l s concerning Nahua dialectology, see Campbell and Langacker
1978, Canger 1978, 1980, 1983, L a s t r a de Suárez 1974; c f . a l s o

      Above a l l , i t i s important to c l a r i f y the term "" P i p i l "" .                     For
some scholars ""Pipil"" s i g n i f i e s only the Pipil language of Central
America; t h i s i s i t s most common intended meaning in the s c i e n t i f i c
l i t e r a t u r e and i t i s the usage proposed here as the only clear and
acceptable meaning for the term. Nevertheless, frequently ""Pipil""
has been employed not only for Central American P i p i l , but also for
r e f e r i n g t o Nahua d i a l e c t s of southern Veracruz, Tabasco, and
Chiapas (southern Mexican s t a t e s ) ; c f . , for example, Fowler 1981,
1984, García de León 1976, Hasler 1958a, 1958b, 1961, 1976, Knab

C e n t r a l American P i p i l , Chiapas Nahua, and d i a l e c t s of southern

       / - t o k i s a p r o g r e s s i v e e n d i n g , s o m e t i m e s used
       a d j e c t i v a l l y . For example, i n P i p i l wa:k-tuk means ""dry""

       P a j a p a n , Veracruz corresponding wa:k-tok means ""dry""
       ( ' a d j e c t i v e ' ) but a l s o "" i t i s drying"" ( ' p r o g r e s s i v e ' ) .
             3) P i p i l has no absolutive s u f f i x with nouns that end
       in - 1 and i t s occurrence with polysyllabic nouns ending

          Grammatical Categories and Morphology
3.0. Introduction     In this chapter the grammatical categories, or parts of speech,
and their morphology are described. In some ways these aspects of
P i p i l are prerequisites to an understanding of the syntactic con-
structions considered in the next chapter. Both t h i s chapter and

tion.","[52, 53]"
"   3.2.2. Pronominal subject affixes. Verbs take pronominal a f -
fixes which either indicate the pronominal subject (if no indepen-
dent subject pronouns, nouns, or noun phrases occur) or mark a
cross-reference to independent subjects (see section 3.7.4). These
prefixes co-occur w i t h the plural suffix -t_ on the verb when the
subject is a plural person. The subject pronminal affixes, then,
are:     ni-
     ti-              you (singular)
     0-               he/she/it

"   4.2.1. Pronominal copula. Equational constructions in which the
subject is a pronoun were considered in section 3.2.2.1. They are
formed by prefixing a subject pronoun normally found on verbs to
the complement, e.g. ni-ta:ka-t ""I am a man"".

verb; the subject typically is a noun phrase, noun, or occasionally
an independent pronoun, while the c o m p l e m e n t is a noun phrase,
noun, adjective, or independent pronoun.           Some examples were
already seen (see 4.1.5.). A few others are:    (1) ne sipiti:yuh chikitik-chin,      ma: tumak ne i-xumpe.

                                     Syntax
4.0. Introduction      This description of P i p i l syntax i s not intended as an examina-
tion of the minor syntactic details nor of the profoundly compli-
cated formal questions that so fascinate many modern grammarians.
I t s goal i s , rather, to provide basic information concerning the
structure of sentences and the function of certain syntactic cate-
g o r i e s , and compounds. The t o p i c s considered and t h e i r order of
presentation follow Langacker (1977), except that more morphologi-
cal topics were covered in the last chapter. Many of the examples
are taken from the t e x t s of chapter 7; these are marked with a
l e t t e r and number code, the l e t t e r to i n d i c a t e the text and the
number for the line within i t ( f o r details, see chapter 7).","[112, 113, 114, 115]"
"3.2. Pronouns   3.2.1. Independent pronouns. The full or independent pronouns
are optional, given that in any case subject and object pronominal
affixes are required with the verb. The independent pronouns are:    naha           I
    taha           you (singular)
    yaha           he/she/it
    tehemet        we
    amehemet (SD),
    an-ehemet (C) you (plural)
    yehemet        they    In normal speech these may optionally appear in an abbreviated
forra, if they bear no particular emphasis, e.g.:
54
     na, nah                I
     ta, tah                you (singular)
     ya, yah                he/she/it
     te(:)met               we
     ame(:)t,
     an=e(:)met             you (plural)
     ye(:)met               theyIn actual use, the abbreviated        singular    forms are m u c h   more
frequent that the plurals.","[67, 68]"
"    4.14. Relative clauses. Relative clauses in Pipil are similar
in function to those of Spanish and are normally introduced by ne
'relative pronoun', ke (a borrowing of the Spanish relative marker
jjue), and at times ka(h) ""who, what"". In what follows examples are
presented in which the relativized noun phrase (signaled by the
relative marker) functions first as the logical subject of the
relative clause, followed by examples as the logical object.
                                                                  129
   4.14.1. Relativized subjects.   1) ni-k-miktih ne mistun ka ki-kwah ne tu:tu-t.
   I-it-killed the cat that it-ate the bird.
   ""I killed the cat which ate the bird.""   2) naha ni-k-ita-k ne siwa:-t ne ki-pa:k ne kwah-kwa:ch-ti.
   I I-her-see-PRET the woman-ABSOL that it-washed the
PL-clothes.
   ""I saw the woman who washed the clothes.""   3) kunih ahsi-ke-t i-chan ne ta:ka-t kah ki-kutarain-ki.
   then arrive-PRET-PL     his-house    the   man-ABSOL    who

   ""Then they arrived (at) the house of the man who threw it down.""   4) kunih ne ta:ka-t ke kl-kutamin k-its-ki ne chumpipi
k-wi:ka ka i-chan. (H-10)
   then the man-ABSOL that it-throw it-grab-PRET the turkey it-take
to his-house.
   ""Then the man who threw it down grabbed the turkey (and) took it
to his house.""","[142, 143]"
"Some indications of how this rule works are the following.
      a) The root—final vowel i s maintained a f t e r a consonant cluster:
- a h s i - k ""(he) a r r i v e d "" , -chihcha-k ""(he) spat"", - i x k a - k ""(he)
roasted ( i t ) "" , uksi-k ""cooked"", etc.
      b) The root-final vowel i s maintained when the verbal root ends
in -ka: -chu:ka-k ""(he) cried"", -maka-k ""(he) gave"", -tu:ka-k
"" ( h e ) planted"", -wika-k ""(he) carried ( i t ) "" , e t c .
      c) The f i n a l vowel of the verb root i s preserved because i t ends
in -u: panu-k "" ( i t ) passed"", -temu-k ""(he) descended"", -ehku-k.
etc.
      d) The rule a p p l i e s and here the f i n a l vowel i s l o s t (the
'present' being compared with 'past' forms): a:na. - a n - k i ""(he)
grabbed ( i t ) "" ; - c h i v a , - c h i x - k i ""(she) looked"",    -kaki.        -kak
""(she) heard ( i t ) "" ;            -nemi. nen-ki "" ( i t ) was""; k i : s a , k i : s - k i
""(she) l e f t "" ; e t c .
    (1.2) Vowel loss in nouns. A rule very s i m i l a r to the vowel-
loss rule in verbs also applies to nouns, except that the f i n a l -u
of nouns may also be dropped and the loss of a of noun roots ending
in -ka i s v a r i a b l e with respect to loss. This i s indeed a phono-
logically conditioned rule, though i t s application i s most easily
perceived in certain grammatical contexts, for example in nominal
forms bearing a possessive prefix where the absolutive s u f f i x i s
not present so that the end of the noun root i s bare (see section
3.1.1.), leaving r o o t - f i n a l vowels in w o r d - f i n a l p o s i t i o n . Its
application i s also noted in compound words (see section 4.7). The
rule, then i s :
30     Rule lb) Vowel loss in nouns: a root-final vowel of a
     noun (i, e, a^ and sometimes u) is lost before voiceless
     consonants of suffixes or in nominal compounds if the
     loss would not result in a monosyllabic form, or in a
     consonant cluster of two members word-finally, or in a
     cluster of more than two consonants word-internally.","[43, 44]"

"   4.2.5.1. Emphatic states. N e m i can be used in contexts which

   xu:-pan      ""winter"" (rainy season) (xuxuwik ""green"" (?))   3.1.3.2. -tan. The locative suffix - t a n means approximately
""in, among, under, near, next to"". Historically it is closely
connected with -tani ""under, beneath, below"". It is also not
productive. Some examples are:  ka:ka:lu:-tan  San Julián          (cf. CN cacalo-tl ""crow"")

   3.1.3.4. -ta(:)l. Pipil has a suffix which seems to be derived
from the root ta:l ""land"": its basic meaning seems to be ""place of
many"" of the things named by the noun root to which it is attached.
It corresponds to the Spanish suffix -al. -ar (e.g. platanal
""plantain grove"" (cf. plátano ""plantain""), piñal ""pine grove"" (cf.
pino ""pine""), frijolar ""bean patch"" (cf. frijol ""bean""), carrizal
""canebrake"" (cf. carrizo ""cane, reed""), cafetal ""coffee orchard"",
etc. It is possible that the meaning and perhaps even the origin
of this suffix has been influence by this Spanish case, given that
other Nahua varieties are not known to have such an ending. Forms
with this suffix are:     a:ka-tal   canebrake, place of reeds      (a:ka- ""reed"")
     a:ma-tal   many amate trees/paper          (a:ma- ""amate"")
     e:-tal     bean patch, bean field          (e:- ""bean"")
     saka-tal   pasture                        (saka- ""grass"")
     te-tá:l,   rocky place                    (te- ""stone"")
       tetal
     tewti-tá:l dusty ground                    (tew-ti ""dust"")
     uku-tal     pine grove                    (uku- ""pine"",
                                               cf. Sp. ocotal)
     u:wa-tal     canebrake, uncleared land    (u:wa- ""cane"", Sp.
                                                   huatal)
     wa:k-ta:1    dry ground                    (wa(:)ki ""dry"")   3.1.3.5. -ka. Pipil has some nouns which are derived from
verbs or adjectives by means of the suffix -ka. In other varieties
of Nahua this suffix, in addition to being a nominalizer, is re-
lated to the 'perfect' and the 'remote past'. Nevertheless, Pipil
has no 'remote past' and its 'perfect' forms do not include -ka.
Noun roots that take this suffix undergo vowel-loss (see section
2.2, rule 1). The following show it:     cha:mah-ka    waist          (cha:mawak ""thick"")
     i:xpil-ka     squatting      (i:xpilua ""to sqat"")
     mulin-ka      sprout         (mulu:ni ""to puff up"")
     -pat-ka       change         (pata ""to change"")
     pepetska      silver fish    (cf. pets-tik ""smooth"")
     pu:pu:l-ka    dregs          (pu:su:l ""posol"")
     tuhtuk-ka     brooding hen   (tu:ka ""to bury"" (?))
     tumah-ka       fat (n.)        (tuma:wak ""fat"" (Adj.))
     tsah-ka       lid            (tsakwa ""to close"")
     yaman-ka      lukewarm       (yama:nik ""bland"")
                                                                   49   Another very restricted suffix, which appears to be related to
this -ka. is the locative ending -kan. The few examples are:  ta-we:y-kan   country(side) (cf. we:y ""big"")
  ta-ne:s-kan   dawn, clearing (cf. ne:si ""to appear"")
  yeh-kan       alone, to the right (ye:k ""good"" (?))   3.1.3.6. -ni. The 'agentive' suffix -ni derives nouns from
verbs with the meaning of ""one who does the action of the verb"".
Some examples are:  atsakwa-ni       azacuan bird   (a:- ""water"" + tsakwa ""to cover"";
                                      literally ""water-coverer"")
  ehku-ni        ladino,          (ehku- ""to arrive"")
                   foreigner
  kuchi-ni       sleepy-head      (kuchi- ""to sleep"")
  kukuya-ni      sick person      (kukuya- ""to get sick"")
  ma:wiltiaya-ni playful person   (m-a:wiltia ""to play"")
  miki-ni        dead person      (miki- ""to die"")
  tacha-ni       lizard sp.       (ta-chiya- ""to look"")
  takwi:ka-ni    singer           (takwi:ka- ""to sing"")
  tapahtiya-ni   curer            (ta-pah-tia ""to cure"")
  tapa:ka-ni     washer woman     (ta-pa:ka- ""to wash"")
  tatu:ka-ni     planter, sower   (ta-tu:ka- ""to plant"")
  tatsa:wa-ni    weaver           (ta-tsa:wa- ""to weave"")
   3.1.3.7. -s. (-lis, - w i s , -was). The -s, suffix also derives
nouns from verbs, nouns which reflect the activity of the verb. It
is no longer productive, and Pipil has few examples:   tacha-li-s         appearance (ta-chiya ""to look"")
   yuyumuka-li-s     foot fungus (yuyumuka ""to itch"")
   kuku-li-s          sickness   (kuku-ya ""toget sick"")
   a:xa:l-uwa-s      whetstone   (cf. a:xa:l ""sand"")
   ku:-panu-wa-s     bridge       (ku:- 'wood'+ panu- ""to pass"")
   kwahsiwi-s        gumption
   taxwi:-s          pimple      (ta- + ixwi ""to fill"")
   tepu:na-wa-s      drum        (cf. pu:ni ""to burst"" ?)
   tsi:ku-wa-s       comb        (tsikwastia ""to comb"")
   uchpa:n-wa-s      broom       ((u)chpa:na ""to sweep"")   3.1.3.8. -tsin. The suffix -tsin is productive and has a
'diminutive' or 'reverential' function. In some words this suffix
bears the stress even though it may not be the penultimate
syllable. Also, it is pronounced at times as -chin instead of the
50expected    -tsin.   In plural     forms it Is       reduplicated,
tsintsin in many of the dialects, but -tsitsin in Cuisnahuat. Some
examples are:     a:yu:-tsin        turtle
     cha:kwah-tsin     storage hook
     chapa-chin        short(y)       mistun-tsin    kitten

which is not productive and occurs with few nouns. Its plural is
-pipil in Cuisnahuat and -pilpil in other locations. The examples
are:     iknu-pil       orphan
     -kwitapil      tail (cf. kwita-t ""excrement"")
     -nenepil       tongue
     siwa:-pil      girl (cf. siwa:-t ""woman"")   3.1.3.10. -1_ 'passive nominalization'. Many nouns are derived
from passive verbs with the suffix           resulting in passive
nominalizations, for example ta-kwa-1 ""food"", from ta-kwa ""to
eat"" + —_1 'passive nominalization'; or ta-xka-1 ""rigua, tortilla"",
from ta- 'something' + (i)xka ""to roast"", literally ""something
roasted"". Note that frequently nouns derived from verbs bear ta-
'unspecified object 1 (see section 3.3.4.4.). For more details on
passivization, see section 3.8.3.
                                                                 51   3.1.4. 'Plural'. Pluralization of nouns in Pipil is somewhat
complicated not only by the fact that there are several different
ways to form the plural, but also because some nouns take a combi-
nation of plural markers. The most common elements in plural
formations are reduplication (see below) and the suffix -t
'plural', also found in plural verb forms. Core Nahua has changed
this -t_ 'plural' to -ji or   thus Pipil is conservative in main-
taining this trait. The various plural markers are now taken up
individually.   (1) -ket is the most restricted plural marker, limited to a very
few human nouns:    lamat-ket,
      lah-lamat-ket      old women
    sih-siwa:t-ket       women
    xuh-xu:ret-ket       old men
    ukich-ket            males, men, husbands   (2) -me-t occurs with a larger, though still very limited
number of nouns; these are also, with few exceptions, 'human'
nouns:    ahsi:1-met               nits
    ah-alma-met              souls
    ah-alwa: si :1-me t      constables, policemen
    ehkuni-met               ladinos
    lah-lamah-tsi-tsin-met, little old women
      lah-lamah-chi-chin-met
    —ma :n—me t              brothers
    nah-na:n-met             mothers
    peh-pe:lu-met            dogs
    pipil-met                boys
    tah-ta:ka-met            men
    tixkwi-met               lazy persons
    tsih-tsinnanats-met      women with large buttocks
    uh-ukich-met             males, men
    xuh-xu:lu-met            babies   (3) -wan, as indicated above (31.2.1), is the plural of w
'possession' and is limited to a few kinship terms (which are in
character 'intimately' possessed).
52
   (A) -tsi(n)tsin (see section 3.1.3.8.) ) is the plural of the
suffix -tsin 'diminutive' or 'reverential'.      (5) -pi(l)pil (see section 3.1.3.9.) is the plural of the other
1
    diminutive'suffix.","[60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66]"
"   3.2.3. Pronominal object prefixes. Transivitive verbs normally
bear also a prefix which references the object. These pronominal
object prefixes can cross reference an independent object pronoun,
noun, or noun phrase (usually with a third person prefix) or they
can signal the object directly if it is pronominal. These prefixes
are:    -nech-       me
    -mits-       you (singular)
    -k(i) -      him/her/it
    -tech-       us
    -mitsin-     you (plural)
    -(k)in-      themThe prefix -(k)in ""them"" has the lc when not preceded by another
prefix or w h e n a vowel precedes it. The k(i)~, the most frequent,
loses the vowel when preceded or followed by another vowel, but It
kepts its i_ before the elements - a h - and - e l (see section 2.2).
These function most frequently as direct objects, but also serve to
indicate indirect objects. (For more details concerning their
56
form, function, and what happens when direct and indirect objects
co-occur, see section 4.1.7). Some examples are:    ni-k-ida-k                   I saw it
    ni-k-neki                    I want it
    ki-neki                      he wants it
    ti-nech-ita-k                you saw rae
    ni-mits-ita-k                I saw you
    ti-mitsin-ita-ke-t           we saw you (pi.)
    tech-ita-ke-t                they saw us
    ni-kin-ita-k                 1 saw them
There are other elements which can occupy the place of these object
prefixes, e.g. m u - 'reflexive' and ta- 'unspecified object'. When
the verb bears one of these other object-like affixes, the object
pronominal prefixes do not appear (cf. section 3.7.4.).","[69, 70]"

/h/ ( v o i c e l e s s g l o t t a l f r i c a t i v e ) , as in E n g l i s h house. Vowels
have e s s e n t i a l l y the same value as the corresponding vowels of
Spanish, although there i s in a d d i t i o n a length c o n t r a s t . The
vowels jj and             can vary f r e e l y in their phonetic realization among
u(:), U(:), and o ( : ) , but ji and uj_ a r e by f a r the most frequent and
common pronunciations. The e_ varies in a very few cases with                                            in
less           careful       speech, e.g. ne / ni ' d e f i n i t e a r t i c l e ' , - n e c h - /
-nich- ""me"" ( ' f i r s t person singlular object pronoun'), etc.
      Vowel length i s an important c o n t r a s t , but i t i s d i f f i c u l t to
determine in many cases. There are such minimal pairs as pa;ta ""to
melt"" / pata ""to change""; ne: "" t h e r e "" / ne ' d e f i n i t e a r t i c l e ' ; the
roots m e : t s - ""moon"" / mets- "" t h i g h "" ; e t c . , but such p a i r s are not
f r e q u e n t . The d i f f i c u l t y i s t h a t , due to P i p i l ' s moribund s t a t e ,
many speakers no longer make the vowel-length contrast, or they do
i t only in more f o r m a l c o n t e x t s . Among my main c o n s u l t a n t s in
Cuisnahuat, one lacked the contrast altogether, another had i t only
in formal contexts (for example when c a r e f u l l y comparing l i n g u i s t i c
forms, reciting word l i s t s , etc.), and a third used i t consistently
throughout his speech. In Santo Domingo de Guzmán my consultants
generally lacked the contrast in everyday speech, but were able to
produce the d i s t i n c t i o n s when queried about i n d i v i d u a l words.
Nevertheless, only two individuals there maintained the distinction
consistently in a way r e l a t i v e l y easy to perceive.
       In both dialects the léngth contrast i s clear only in stressed
s y l l a b l e s , i.e. the penultimate, in most forms. Notwithstanding,
in many cases d i f f e r e n t s y l l a b l e s may be stressed in derivations
with v a r i e d p r e f i x e s or s u f f i x e s , e.g. / m a s a : - t / ( m á s a t ) "" d e e r "" .
/ m a s a : - t s i n / ( m a s á r t s i g ) "" l i t t l e deer""; / t e : l p u : c h / ( t é : l p u c h )
""son"", / t e : l p u : c h - t s i n / ( t e l p ú r c h t s i g ) "" l i t t l e son""; /tekuma-t/
(tekúmat) ""bottle gourd"", /nu-tekun/ (nutékug) ""my b o t t l e gourd"",
/ t e k u m a - t s i n / (tekumátsirj) "" l i t t l e bottle gourd"" (""tecomatillo"");
etc. (These examples are cited from Cuisnahuat dialect).
      In Cuisnahuat a l l w o r d - i n i t i a l vowels a r e p h o n e t i c a l l y long,
although those followed by a single consonant are longer than those
f o l l o w e d by two, e.g. / i : s a / ( i : s a ) ""to wake up"", / u l u - t / ( u : l u t )
""corncob"", / i s t a - t / ( i ' s t a t ) "" s a l t "" . Underlying vowel length can
be determined in such forms by f i n d i n g the form with some p r e f i x
which removes the vowel from word-initial position, e.g. /uh-ulu-t/
(uhúlut) ""corncobs"", /nu-ulu/ (nu(w)úlu) ""my corncob"",                                   /n-i:sa-k/
( n i : s a k ) "" I woke up"". Santo Domingo de Guzmán has undergone c e r -
t a i n changes with r e s p e c t to vowel length in t r i s y l l a b i c words,
p a r t i c u l a r l y verbs. With V to r e p r e s e n t a s y l l a b l e , forms with
V..tf:..V have changed to                                in many c a s e s .
26     In the f i n a l a n a l y s i s , although I did a l l I could to determine
underlying vowel length a c c u r a t e l y f o r each of the forms of the
d i c t i o n a r y , many c a s e s remain in which vowel length i s simply
uncertain. The marking of length i s much more secure in stressed
syllables and in frequently occurring words.","[38, 39, 40]"

   Brinton's evidence for identifying AlagUilac (Palacio's
Tlacacebastleca) as Pipil included a short word list collected by
Bromowicz in 1878 (published in Lehmann 1920:1062-7) and four
manuscript pages dating from 1610 to 1637 written in Nahuatl and
found in the Parrish archives of San Agustin Acasaguastlan. From
these Brlnton concluded that ""Alagüilac was a quite pure form of
the Nahuatl"" (Brinton 1887:376), closely related to the Pipil of
Escuintla (p.377). These data, however, do not warrant such con-
clusions. The list of words (cf. section 2) was from San Agustin
Acasaguastlan, the town identified in the colonial sources as
""Mexican"" and not AlaglÜlac in speech. Below it will become clear
that this ""Mexican"" indeed owes its origin to people from central
Mexico and has no special connection to Pipil. Futhermore, the
manuscript pages were written in Nahuatl, a central Mexican dialect
of Nahua. Por example, they contain forms with /tl/, which exists
only in dialects originally connected to central Mexico — Pipil
has only /t/, no /tl/. Some cases are:    ictle       good""           (CN ye:k-tli)

                                  bring about marriages"")
    matlacti-   ""ten""           (CN ma'tlak-)It should be noted that Lehmann (1920:1061) also rejected Brinton's
identification, pointing to similar examples.
   There are at least two possible explanations of how the Mexican
dialect of Nahua registered in the four manuscript pages could come
to be in Acasaguastlan. One has to do with the fact that in New
Spain starting in 1570 the official policy was to make Nahuatl the
general language and no priest who did not know Nahuatl could take
charge of the missions or parishes (Heath 1972:27). This could
explain the Nahuatl fround in Acasaguastlan and in many other
church records of this period from Guatemala and Chiapas in places
where Nahuatl was never the language of the local population. Also
938
many Nahuatl speakers were settled in Guatemala on lands given to
the Mexican and Tlaxcalan auxiliaries who helped the Spanish in the
Conquest. For example, of the town of Los Esclavos in Central
Guatemala Ponce (1873(1586)) said:      LLamanse aquellos indios esclavos, porque realmente lo
      fueronde l o s españoles e l l o s y otros muchos, recien
      conquistada la tierra, quando no estaban las cosas tan
      asentadas ni con tan buen orden como agora están, y un
      presidente (Alonso López Cerrato) de la Audiencia de
      Guatemala lebertó mas de diez mil dellos y los pobló
      en diversas partes, y de aquí se quedaron con aquel
      nombre, hablan la lengua mexicana corrupta, que se
      llama lengua p i p i l (Miles 1957:740).","[953, 954]"
"   Some examples of this rule's application, in which nouns with
the absolutive suffix compared with other forms, are:      atimi-t,
nu-atin ""my louse""; chikiwi-t. nu-chikiw ""my basket""; kakawa-t.
nu-kakaw ""my cacao""; kaxi-t, nu-kax ""my bowl""; kuyame-t. nu-kuyan
""my pig""; kwita-t, nu-kwit ""my excrement""; peta-t, nu-pet ""my
mat""; tekuma-t, nu-tekun ""my bottle gourd""; ikx-u:miyu ""shin"" (from
ikxi- ""foot"" + u:mi-yu ""bone""); ku:n-ti:l ""soot"" (from ku:mi-
""pot"" + ti:l   ""soot (black))""; kuyan=iswa-t ""cuyanigua (a wild
root like a sweet potato)"" (from kuyame- ""pig"" + iswa-t ""leaf"");
etc.
   (1.3) Vowel loss in suffixes. This same rule applies to suf-
fixes, as well. For example, the absolutive suffix has two main
allomorphs, -ti with nouns that end in a consonant, and        with
those which terminate in a vowel (see secation 3.1.1). With -ti as
the underlying (basic) form of this suffix, the - ¿ i s lost if no
consonant clusters result.     For example, underlying /a:ka-ti/
""reed"" becomes a:ka-t (recall that the root-final -a is not lost
when it is protected by the lc (see above)), while in /es-ti/
""blood"" the    of the absolutive -ti is maintained since that its
loss would otherwise result in a final consonant cluster and also
in a monosyllabic form. Some examples both with -C-ti and with -V-t
are:   kak-ti ""sandal"", pah-ti ""medicine"", tix-ti ""corn dough"",
sin-ti ""maize"", me:ts-ti ""moon""; a:waka-t ""avocado"", a:chiyu-t
""bixa (achiote)"", a:-t ""water"", e:-t ""bean"", e:lu-t ""roasting ear
(ear of corn)"", ku:ska-t ""necklace"", kwawi-t ""tree""; etc.
   Similarly, the 'preterite (past tense)' suffix has two allo-
morphs, -ki after consonants and -lc after vowels. (It also has the
variant   in some cases, but that is not relevant to this rule (see
section 3.3.2.).) With /-ki/ as the underlying (basic) form, the
vowel-loss rule eliminates the      if no consonant clusters arise.
For example, compare -maka-k ""(he) gave (it)"", where the -a of the
verb root is protected from loss by the lc and where the final -i of
the suffix is lost, with -chiw-ki ""(he) did (it)"", where the-root
final vowel was lost which created a consonant cluster which in
turn prevented the final vowel of the 'preterite' suffix from loss
(for more examples, see section 3.3.2.).
                                                                 31
   (1.4) Vowel loss in prefixes. Pipil generally keeps its prefix-
final vowels in contrast to Classical Nahuatl and most other Nahua
varieties which tend to lose a prefix vowel when it appears before
another vowel. Notwithstanding, in certain limited contexts Pipil
also loses this vowel. Unlike these other varieties of Nahua,
Pipil does not lose the vowel of possessive prefixes or of subject
pronominal prefixes on verbs, except before the verbal directional
morpheme (w)al- or before i. Some examples are:   n-i:xwi ""I'm filling up/getting full"" (from ni-i:xwi)
   x-ihisiwi ""hurry up!"" (from xi-ihisiwi)
   t-ihkiti ""you weave"" (from ti-ihkiti)and:   x-al-ahsi ""find it!"" (cf. xi-ahsi ""arrive!"")
   t-al-ahsi-k ""you found it"" (cf. ti-ahsi-k ""you arrived"")
   n-al-ahsi-k ""I found it"" (cf. ni-ahsi-k ""I arrived"")
   t-al-ahsi-ke-t ""we found it""(cf. ti-ahsi-ke-t ""we arrived"").","[44, 45]"

they are reduplicated following the same pattern as the redupli-
cated nouns (cf. section 3.1.4.), repeating the first consonant(s),
if any exist, and the first vowel with an Ji added. The redupli-
cated adjective is often the only indication of 'plural' in noun
phrases, as is, for example, ne chih-chi:l-tik tsapu-t ""the red
zapotes"". Some examples of reduplicated adjectives are:     chih-chichi-k            bitter
     chih-chi:1-tik           red
     eh-ete-k                 heavy

     yeh-ye:k                 goodFor information on adjectives in larger constructions, cf. section
4.10. Adjectives are also involved in incorporation (cf. section
4.13.1).  It should also be mentioned that several adjectives
appear with the ta- prefix of 'unspecified object'; for details see
section 3.7.4.2.4.

morphology is the most extensive and because they fall into dis-
tinct classes defined in part phonologically by changes in their
roots when different tenses and aspects are involved. For that
reason, these tenses and aspects are described first, and then the
verb classes which depend on them are presented.","[75, 76, 77, 78, 79]"

"   3.2.2.1. Pronominal copula. There is an equational construction
in which a pronominal subject has a noun or adjective as complement
which is formed by merely affixing these pronominal subject mor-
phemes to the complement. Its form and function are best grasped
from the following examples:    ni-ta:kat                     I am a man
    ti-ta:kat                     you are a man
    taha ti-mayordomoh            you are a steward (A-32)
    an=ehemet an-nu-a:migitus     you are my little friends (R-52)
    ni-tuma:wak                   I am fat
    ni-tsumpe:suh                 I am bald
    taha tesu ti-lionah           you are not Leonarda (S—12)(The letter-number code refers to the texts of chapter 7, where
details are given.)See also the verb morphology (section 3.7.4).     For examples with
the 'directional' morpheme, cf. section 2.2.",[69]
"       3.7.8.3.1. ' I n c h o a t i v e s ' with -ua/-wi/-wa.       The ' i n c h o a t i v e '
suffixes are related to the causatives in that, while the intransi-
t i v e forms have 'inchoative' meaning (""to become what i s signified
in the r o o t "" ) , the t r a n s i t i v e s have a causative meaning, e.g.
k w e : l i w i ( i . v . ) ""to curve"" ( c f . k w e : l - ""curved,   bent""); ku:sua
( t . v . ) "" t o bead, i n s e r t "" ( c f . ku:s- ""bead""). Many of these are
inchoatives of ' s i z e ' or 'shape' ( i n c h o a t i v e s of 'sensations' are
considered later). The transitive counterpart, -ua, has sometimes
been c a l l e d a ' p a s s i v e ' , but i t s function i s more accurately des-
cribed as 'impersonal', a means of employing a t r a n s i t i v e verb

are:    ala:wak          smooth, slick
    cha:ma:wak       thick
    chipa:wak        clear, clean
    kama:wak         tender, not dry

    tuma:wak         fat
(See section 3.6.3.)   3.7.8.3.2. 'Inchoatives' of ""perception"" or ""sensation"" (-va).
Another kind of inchoative verb bears the suffix -ya. which derives
intransitive inchoatives from adjective roots which typically mean
something having to do with ""sensations"" or ""perceptions"". Some
examples are:     chichi:ltiya    to redden (chi:l-tik ""red"")
     chichiya        to become bitter (chichi-k ""bitter"")
                                                                      89
    chika:waya        to ripen (chika:h-tuk ""ripe"")
    chi:ltiya         to redden (chi:l-tik ""red"")
    ihya:ya           to stink (ihya-k ""stinking"")

    kukuya            to get sick, become ill
    ku:ti:ltiya       to blacken (ku:ti:l-tik ""black"")
    pata:waya         to become wide (pata:wa-k ""wide"")
    seseya            to get cold (sesek ""cold"")
    sutawaya          to tire (cf. sutarwa ""to get tired"")
    taku:miya         to get dark (ta-ku:mi ""dark"")
    takwa:waya        to harden (takwa:wa-k ""hard"")
    ti:ltiya          to blacken (ti:l-tik ""black"")
    tuma:waya         to get fat (tuma:wa-k ""fat"")
    tutu:niya         to get hot (tutu:ni-k ""hot"")
    tsitsi:kaya       to be(come) silent
    tsupe:liya        to become sweet (tsupe:le-k ""sweet"")
    yama:niya         to become bland (yama:ni-k ""bland"")
    ye:ktiya          to improve, get fixed (ye:k ""good"")   3.7.8.3.3. -ti ""to become"". The final kind of inchoative takes
the suffix -ti which is not productive, but which derives inchoa-
tive verbs from some noun roots. The examples are:    ta:ka-ti           to grow up (ta:ka-t ""man"")
    kukua-wits-ti     to prick (kuku(a) ""pain"" + wits- ""thorn"")
    teki-ti           to work (teki-t ""work"")For a detailed discussion of inchoative verbs in Nahua generally,

      2.1.1. Phonetic v a r i a n t s (allophones). Some of the segments
presented in Chart 1 have non-distinctive contextual variants ( a l -
lophones), which are taken up now. For consistency and for ease of
reference, phonetic citations in this book will employ the practi-
cal orthographic symbols whenever these are applicable rather than
symbols of the International Phonetic Alphabet or of the modified
American phonetic schemes. Thus, f o r example, a phonetic t r a n s -
c r i p t i o n i : x ""eye"" contains the x. which i s an a l v e o p a l a t a l
fricative.
      1) B a s i c a l l y b,     and j> occur only in words of Spanish o r i g i n
and have the same pronunciation a s in Spanish. That i s , word-

a vowel or other consonants they are f r i c a t i v e s , j u s t a s in the
drink"", and griego (griego) ""Greek"".
                                                                                              27        2) The p r o n u n c i a t i o n of k v a r i e s depending on the d i a l e c t ( c f .
section 1.4).                 In Cuisnahuat, i t i s pronounced & or χ between two
ja's or between vowels where the f i r s t i s long; in other contexts i t
 i s normally k, e x c e p t f o r i n i t i a l k. of the ' t h i r d person s g .

 pronounced ¿ i n i t i a l l y and i n t e r v o c a l i c a l l y , while i t i s k in other
 contexts. Since the conditions f o r these allophones are r e l a t i v e l y
 complicated, occasionally in the dictionary and in one sample text
 from each d i a l e c t (H and N) the phonetic t r a n s c r i p t i o n i s

  t h i s case a s though i t were word-final. Such cases are presented
  with a = representing the compound juncture, e.g. mu-tsun=ahwilia
 ""to wet one's head"", phonetically mutsunahwiliya? ( c f . tsun- 'head'
 ahwilia ""to wet"").
        4) H i s t o r i c a l l y the non-nasal s o n o r a n t s              χ , 1, and χ ) had

  i . e . W, χ , l·^ and Jl r e s p e c t i v e l y . These v a r i a n t s a r e s t i l l found,
  but now in alternation with their voiced counterparts. I t should be
  p o i n t e d out t h a t h i s t o r i c a l l y the f i n a l - χ not only became
  v o i c e l e s s in t h i s position, but further changed to x. This i s seen
  in such P i p i l examples a s n i - k - u : y a "" I s h e l l i t "" (where the -ja
  'present t r a n s i t i v e ' keeps the χ from f i n a l position) compared to

   ( l a b i a l i z e d b i l a b i a l ) , hw, and h. These r e a l i z a t i o n s depend
   l a r g e l y on the v o l i t i o n of the speaker and i n p a r t on the vowel
   t h a t f o l l o w s ( e . g . h. i s much more common and _f rauch l e s s f r e q u e n t
   with a following round vowel). Older and more a s s i m i l a t e d loans

                          The Hurricaners
         (Los Huracaneros, English narrative translation)   (1) I remember what my grandmother and my grandfather told me.
(2) In those days there came ""hurricaners"" from a town called
Chilteopan. (3) When they say there is going to be a big storm, so
they say, in the wind that comes by there come men and women in the
wind such that they come to carry off ears of corn for them to eat.
(4) Thus the milpas were left broken, quite flattened, with many
ears of corn disfigured with a look like pustules. (5) Those were
the ears of corn that the Chilteopaners took, according to my
grandfather and my grandmother.
   (6) But in this case, once there was a smart man who held that
what they came to do in our town was too much. (7) So he made a
trap. (8) In the trap he was able to catch a girl of about
eighteen. (9) But at the moment she fell to the ground, immediate-
ly the girl changed into a turkey. (10) Then the man who caught
and grabbed the turkey took it to his house. (11) Immediately he
ordered his wife to kill the turkey so they could eat it. (12) So
his wife killed the turkey, plucked it, and made the food, and they
ate it. (13) But what they noticed was that the dog did not eat
the turkey's bones and feathers. (14) Then the whole family was
left puzzled because the dog wouldn't eat the bones nor the
feathers. (15) On the third day after the storm had passed and
they had eaten the turkey, there came two men and a woman to look
872for it. (16) They arrived at the house of the m a n w h o had caught
it because they more or less already knew who had caught it. (17)
But the did not tell the truth, but rather arrived asking if by
chance he had seen a girl pass near his house the day of the big
storm. (18) W h a t he answered w a s that he had not seen a girl.
(19) What he had found on open ground was a turkey. (20) Then he
caught it and took it home and told his wife to kill it and make
the food, and they ate it. (21) Then the three said, ""well, what
you have done is all right, but I want you to do me a favor"". (22)
""Show me, at least, where the feathers are, where the bones were
left, so I can go see where they are"". (23) Then the man went to
show them. (24) The three came to where the feathers and bones
were that the dog had not eaten. (25) Then they picked up the
bones, made a pile, and asked for a trough and a lot of water and a
spool of thread, and they throw it into the air. (26) Soon it
thrundered. (27) When it thundered he saw that it just turned
around. (28) In the turn that it made it raised and disappeared.
(29) Actually, they took the girl because at the moment the man saw
that they tried this, he saw perfectly (well) that a beautiful girl
came out of the bones and feathers.
     (30) So, the ""hurricaners"" in reality come from Chilteopan; they
c o m e to take ears of corn to eat. (31) But they were screwed up,
because they killed the girl and ate her. (32) That's what my
grandfather and grandmother told me, and big storms always come,
but we never saw if one c a m e to fall. (33) So, today I a m telling
this to my friend so he can take this story with him as a
remembrance.

"    1.4. Pipil dialectology. Having considered Pipil's ethnohis-
tory and its position relative to other varieties of Nahua, I now
turn to an inspection of Pipil's own regional variation. My origi-
nal intent in studying Pipil dialects was to determine where the
language is still spoken and to obtain a general characterizataion
of local dialect variation. The goal was not to provide an exhaus-
tive account of minor regional differences. The dialect features
presented here, then, give a good idea of major differences among
local dialects, but it does not provide a comprehensive view of
variation within each location. These dialect traits are presented
in broad phonetic representation, not really phonemic, but
employing the Pipil practical alphabet to the extent that it is
possible (see section 2.1).
   (1) In Chiltiupán _ts tends to change to s, e.g. saput ""Zapote""
(from tsaput; susukul ""water jug (cántaro)"" (from tsutsukul); etc.
   (2) In Concepción de Ataco the vowels i^ and ii have been lost
between stops and semivowels, e.g. kwat ""snake""(from ku(;)wat),
kwa ""to buy"" (from kuwa). maltyá ""to bathe"" (from m-a(:)lti(y)a;
the χ is inserted by rule, cf. 2.2). It should also be noticed
that the lost vowel would ordinarily bear stress when in penulti-
mate position and consequently stress is shifted to the final
vowel.
   (3) Originally the final and preconsonantal -1_ of Pipil (and
probably of Proto-Nahua as well) was devoiced (1), but today there
is considerable variation between voiced and voiceless pro-
nunciation in these position and even in other positions in certain
dialects. In Cuisnahuat the voiced and voiceless counterparts vary
rather freely in final position. Final -1 is always voiceless in
Jicalapa. In Teotepeque, the voiceless 1 (1) has been generalized
to all positions; that is, ¿ has changed totally to    everywhere,
e.g. peíu ""dog"", tihian ""chicken"", tekutut ""owl"", kumat ""griddle"",
chiitik ""red"", maitiya ""to bathe"", kai ""house"", etc.
   In Jicalapa, not only is final         devoiced, but 1_ in all
positions is palatalized, lj, prepalatalized finally,          Some
14exampales are: pel^u ""dog"", tihlyan ""chicken"", tekulyut ""owl"",
chakalyin ""shrimp"", el^ut ""ear of corn"", ul y ut ""corncob"", kumayl·
""griddle"", taxka^i ""tortilla"", tuna^t ""sun"", Imamat ""old woman"",
ka?l· ""house"", etc.
   (4) In Teotepeque χ (/δ/) has changed to / V , a retroflexed
fricative, and now is in free variation with rr (/?/). I believe
the later change to rr. is due to Spanish influence. There is
sociolinguistically conditioned variation in local Spanish between
r and '·è, where at least nearby in Guatemala the s   · variant is
stigmatized. I believe that the negative value placed on this
variant in Spanish has contributed to the Teotepeque change to r, a
change in the direction of the prestige variant in Spanish, the
dominant language in this setting. Some examples are:      Suchit /
ruchit ""flower"", suiet / rul-et ""old man"", teskan ""tick1', sukut
""hogplum"", a'san ""now"".
   (5)Teotepeque and Comasaguya have a before ¿ in monosyllabic
roots where others dialects have e¿ e.g. -may ""hand"", -kway
""skirt"".
   (6) Pipil k has several variants in the different dialects, but
in every case the underlying segment remains Je. In Cuisnahuat Jc is
voiced and sometimes fricativized ¿ between two vowels when the
first is long or if both are ji's. Occasionally it is voiced ini-
tially in certain words, particulary frequent with k(i)~ 'third
person sg. pronominal' prefix.     In Santo Domingo de Guzmán k is
voiced    initially, intervocalically, and after n. In Tacuba,
it is voiced between vowels. In the other dialects Jc is generally
maintained without change.
   In all dialects, final η is velar (g) and the stress falls on
the penultimate syllable except for certain Spanish loans,
occasionally the suffix -tsin (cf. section 3.1.3.8), and those
words in Ataco which lost penultimate i. or ji between stops and
semivowels (see above).
   Vowel length is not represented in the list of dialect forms
that follows due to lack of reliable information except for
Cuisnahuat and Santo Domingo de Guzmán, where it was investigated
systematically . It is to be supposed, however, that vowel length
in the other dialects, where it still exists, will be nearly the
same as in these two dialects.
   The following word lists exemplify the changes and variation in
the individual dialects. The abbreviations are:

"   3.7.3.1. Class I ((C)VCV) verbs. Class I verbs typically lose
their root-final vowel in the 'preterite' and 'perfect'. Some lose
the vowel only in the 'perfect' and not in the 'preterite' (cf. the
vowel-loss rules, section 2.2). Class I verbs are characteristi-
cally of the shape (C)VCV, but do not include the (C)Vka or (C)VCu
forms of Class II. Loss of the root-final vowel in these verbs
creates no consonant clusters of more than two members. The
'preterite' with this class is normally -ki or       except in the
case of certain intransitive verbs which keep the root vowel in the
                                                                 71
'preterite' but lose it in the 'perfect'.   Glass I is by far the
largest class. Examples of it are:  ah-suma      to comb          pi:tsa       to blow a whistle
  a:-kal-aki   to sink          piya         to have

largest group is Class II. These verbs do not lose their root-
final vowel in the 'preterite' or the 'perfect'. The majority are
characterized by the phonological shapes: (C)VCCV, (C)Vka, and
72(C)VCu — the shapes that resist vowel-loss either because other-
wise impermissible consonant clusters would arise, or because -ka
and -τι are not subject to the rule (cf. section 2.2). Neverthe-
less, there are some verbs of this class which have none of these
phonological patterns, but fail to undergo vowel loss. The form of
the 'preterite' of Class II verbs is -Jc in the singular (all
classes have -ke-t in the plural). Some examples are:     ahsi         arrive         patska      to milk, twist
     ahwa         to scold       pixka       to pick, harvest
     a:ti         to drink       pixki       for kernels to peel
     chihcha      to spit        takwi:ka    to sing
     chu :ka      to cry         tamu: ta    to throw
     ehku         to arrive      tasuhta     to love
     ina          to tell        tata        to burn
     i: sa        to awaken      tehku       to climb
     isu:ta       to vomit       te:ka       to put on the ground
     ixka         to roast       temu        to descend
     kikinaka     to complain    tu:ka       to bury, plant
     maka         to give        tsahtsi     to shout
     mu:ta         to throw at   uksi        to cook
     naka         to stay        uni         to drink
      (also Class I)
     namaka       to sell        weli        to be able to
     ne: si       to appear      wetska      to laugh
     pa:ka        to wash        wi:ka       to take
     pata         to change      xu:ta       to wound
     pa: ti       to melt   3.7.3.3. Class III (-ia, -ua). The verbs of Class III end in
-ia or -ua in the 'present'; in the 'preterite' and 'perfect' their
roots end in -ih and -uh; and in the 'conditional' and 'future'
forms their roots end in plain -i_ and -u. Phonetically in the
'present' these are (-iya) and (-uwa) and are not phonetically
distinct from verbs with underlying /-iya/ (and /-uwa/). They
are morphophonemically distinct, however, given that these latter
are either -iya-k or -ix(-k) in the 'preterite'. Historically it
is probable that Pre-Proto-Nahua had an intervocalic li which was
lost in Class III verbs (i.e. -iha, -uha) in their present stems.
This accounts for why ji is present in the 'preterite' and 'perfect'
forms of this class; the ti was not intervocalic here and hence was
not lost. We might further postulate that this historical Ji was
lost in the 'conditionals' and 'futures' of this class because it
would have otherwise created a consonant cluster of more than two
members (e.g. -iK-skiya, -uK-s-ke-t) or two consonants at the end
                                                                    73
of a word (e.g. - i K - s 'singular future 1 ). Also, historically the
verbs with a short vowel before w plus a_ (i.e. -Vwa) changed ulti-
mate to - u a (cf. Canger 1980). This change is evident in Pipil
reflexes as in the pairs of verbs where the transitive has -ua and
the corresponding intransitive has -Vwi. e.g.:   ihtakawi      to break down    ihtakua     to take apart, ruin
   kwe:chiwi     for corn to be   kwe:chua    to grind finely
                   insect-eaten
   kwe:liwi      to curve, bend   kwe:lua     to bend (something)   Thus it seems that historical - V w a became -uha and later the li
was lost intervocalically, giving -ua, but preserved finally and
before a single consonant. This is a reflex of the Pre-Proto-Nahua
change of syllable-final w to h (cf. Campbell and Langacker 1978).
Some examples of this class are:  ahnekua        to smell                ilpia       to tie
  cha(:)lua      to hit, beat            ilwia       to say
  chichinua      to singe                iskalia     to raise, rear
