"   In the differentiation of inflected and uninflected verbs, the 'Burulo
dialect differs in many ways from the Lokai and Ugandan dialects of
Ma'di; for example, in 'Burulo there is no object-verb order difference.
   We discuss the inflected, uninflected and directive verbs in separate
chapters. Using the classification proposed by Heine (1976), the Lokai
Madi type of word order is Type B: partly SVO, partly SOV; the 'Burulo
type of word order is type A: SVO.",[31]
"
8.5.    Dialectal variation : 'BuruloWhen it comes to the inflected verb, 'Burulo differs radically from Lokai.
The morphology of the verb is very different, and most strikingly the
word order is verb-object when the verb is inflected (nonpast).",[190]
"
9.7. The form which we call 'directive' is called 'subjunctive' by
     TuckerTucker (1940: 226) calls what we are calling 'directive' the 'subjunctive'.
He says that it is used in sentences expressing 'permission, compulsion
or doubt'. He comments that it very often follows the auxiliary verbs 6a,
εΒε, de (meaning 'make, let'), and in Ma'di it can follow Ιε ('want').
Tucker comments on the fact that the word order does not seem to match
the pronoun paradigm: the paradigm, including ka in the third person is
like the paradigm for inflected verbs, but the word order is like the word
order for uninflected verbs.
   Tucker further suggests that the subjunctive (directive) is used in the
dialect he calls Pandikeri (our 'Burulo) in a narrative to express a
sequence of actions. As evidence he cites a translation of two verses from
the New Testament. W e think this is not correct for the dialect he is
discussing, and arises in his examples as a stylistic use of the directive to
give an effect of high formality in the Biblical translation.
                           Chapter 10
                   Suffixed subordinate verbsIn this chapter we look at verbs which have a low tone prefix and one of
five suffixes: kä, 1ε, re, fia, and djó.
    These verbs are contained in subordinate clauses which can be
complement to a verb, or a modifier of a noun (ie. relative clause) or a
modifier of a missing noun (ie. headless relative). In this chapter we focus
on the internal structure of the clauses: the kinds of subject and object
they have. In chapter 16 we consider the roles played by these clauses as
arguments and modifiers.
    In the glosses we use square brackets to mark the boundaries of the
subordinate clauses; this is an aid to the reader. In a few cases we are in
doubt about the placement of a boundary and in these cases we have not
indicated boundaries in the glosses. We gloss all suffixes as -SB. We
gloss the prefix as N-.","[205, 206, 207]"
"A deleted pronominal is always interpreted as third person. Thus in order
to get a first or second person subject with a vowel-initial verb, the 'long'
paradigm must be used, where information about the person of the subject
is recoverable even after vowel deletion.",[151]

4.5.6.3. Epenthesis in loanwordsVowels are inserted in loanwords to ensure the right syllable structure
such that there are no consonant clusters, and no final consonants.
Factoring out harmony, of the five vowels, all except [e] are used as
epenthetic vowels in loanwords. There does not appear to be any fully
systematic pattern, but there are some tendencies towards a matching for
height, with high root vowels [i] and [u] attracting [i] or [u] as epenthetic
vowels, and other vowels attracting [o] and [a]. The most common final
epenthetic vowel is [i], as in tód^ári 'business' from Juba Arabic tud^ar,
or ìqgìiisì 'English' or pagani from pagan·, [i] also breaks up a consonant
cluster in susltà 'zip' from Juba Arabic susta, [u] is found as a final
epenthetic vowel in gàlamù 'pen' and breaks up a consonant cluster in
rúküsá 'permit' from Juba Arabic ruksa, and ógùnà 'syringe' from Juba
Arabic ugna, [o] is a final vowel in kópólò 'corporal' and fàìrò 'file',
and breaks up a consonant cluster in sókósì, from English socks, [a] is a
final vowel in lamba from lamp, and màkànlkà from mechanic,              and
breaks up a consonant cluster in idàfârà 'eleven', from Juba Arabic
idashra.

as a loanword in Ma'di and makes a Ma'di verb from it with M*L tone.
Examples include 1mlsì 'miss' from English 'miss', loda 'order' from
English 'order', lätäki 'attack' from English 'attack', and Igâdà 'to have
lunch' from Juba Arabic gâdà 'lunch'. This is quite a productive
process.

                                VerbsIn this chapter we look at the morphology of verb stems, derivational
morphology of verbs, inflectional morphology of verbs, and the
morphological status of pronominals relative to the verb. We then look at
some syntactic classes of verbs, looking at verbs with cognate objects, and
at various idiomatic expressions. We conclude the chapter by discussing
verbs which take as their subjects patient arguments rather than agent
arguments.","[84, 85, 86, 87]"

     structure19.1.1. Realization of subject and object19.1.1.1.     Options for realization of the subjectIn our view, every root clause whether verbal or nonverbal always has a
pronominal subject. The pronominal subject can optionally be preceded
by a 'subject' noun phrase, which we call the 'adjoined subject' because
it is in a sense 'adjoined' to the true pronominal subject. In the
pronominal paradigm for the uninflected verb (the U-paradigm), the first
or second person pronominal subject can either be 'short', consisting of a
vowel prefix only, or 'long', consisting of the vowel prefix to which a full
independent pronoun is adjoined. There does not appear to be any
significant difference in information structure between the short and long
pronominals. The difference, if anything, is associated with dialectal
tendencies, with some speakers preferring one and some the other form,
though we note that some speakers who use both long and short forms
think the long pronoun is (in their words) more 'emphasized'.","[556, 557, 558, 559]"

17.2.4.   Tucker on wàTucker says that wà is attached to the verb in Lokai and separated in
Panderiki (ie. the 'Burulo dialect). We have found no evidence for
attachment to the verb in any dialect. It may be that Tucker is
reinterpreting the fact that Lokai differs from 'Burulo in that it can have
object-verb order, where the verb is capable of being followed
immediately by wà.

17.4.1. Negation and tense
In descriptive negation, the verb is always uninflected, never inflected. The
uninflected vs. inflected distinction normally expresses tense on the verb;
in descriptive negation, the tense is expressed instead by the negation
particle. Djuruni (1983: 91) proposes a functional explanation of why
descriptive negation in Logbara takes the 'past tense' syntax, which is
that the past is like negation in that they both involve 'non-presence'.
Some descriptions of Central Sudanic languages propose, in our view
incorrectly, that the distinction between kü and küru or cognates is one of
aspect rather than tense, parallel to a claim made in these descriptions that
object-verb order distinguishes aspect rather than tense (8.4.2.4).
17.4.1.1.    ku : nonpast
¿¿»combines with an uninflected verb, and expresses nonpast (present or
future) tense. The combination of the uninflected verb with ku appears to
be equivalent to the inflected verb in that it expresses nonpast, either

  the ao strategy
  the null strategy
  the ?f strategy
  the m strategy
The strategies differentiate among arguments by:
  (a) Grammatical function: aü and the null strategy are found only with
      objects.
  (b) Person: ni focuses third person subjects while ?1 focuses first and
      second person subjects.
  (c) Definiteness: the null strategy is used for final bare indefinites and
      the ?ï-strategy for other kinds of final noun phrase.
  (d) Wh- vs. non-wh-: ni will normally not focus an object, but will
      focus a wh-object in certain circumstances.
  (e) Type of verb: the null strategy can be used to focus a final bare
      indefinite object of an uninflected verb but not the final bare
      indefinite object of a directive verb.
A pronominal argument can be focused. A null object can be focused. A
left-dislocated object (which leaves a pronominal copy behind) can be
focused. A subject or object which is a wh-phrase must be focused, and
can in addition optionally be left-dislocated.","[560, 561]"
"
8.4.2.4. Inflection as a coding of tense rather than aspectWe treat aspect as secondary, correlating with tense interpretation and not
having any direct morphological manifestation. In this we disagree with
the tradition of analyzing Ma'di (along with other Central Sudanic
languages) as primarily grammaticalizing aspect rather than tense. This
tradition is most influentially stated in Tucker (1940: 71). Tucker notes
that there are two distinct syntaxes for verbs, involving different choices
of subject paradigm and different positions for the object (he does not
                                                            Interpretation   173observe the presence of the low tone inflectional prefix). What we identify
as the uninflected form is described by Tucker as expressing 'complete,
perfect, definite' and what we identify as the inflected form is described
by Tucker as expressing 'incomplete, imperfect, progressive, indefinite'.
Most - perhaps all - subsequent writers on all Central Sudanic languages
accept Tucker's position that the distinction is basically a
grammaticalization of aspect and not a grammaticalization of tense. For
Ma'di, this seems to us to be incorrect; the inflected form is sometimes
imperfective (when present) and sometimes perfective (when future).
Fundamentally what the inflection and correlating aspects of the syntax
codify is that the verb is nonpast. (Progressive past and future are
expressed by other means, as described above.) To some extent this
disagreement relates to how one interprets the relation in principle
between aspect and tense in general linguistic terms, and whether for
example one assumes that as a universal the future is inherently
imperfective, as Lojenga (1994: 246) apparently does in her discussion of
Ngiti.","[188, 189]"
"
7.3.2. The object can be omittedThe object can always be omitted and implied when the transitive verb is
uninflected. This is true for all verbs.(20)     5-               pa       eßl
         3s               eat      fish

         'He ate fish.'(21)     o-               pa                             ádsinl
         3S               eat                            yesterday
         SUBJECT          VERB     (IMPLIED OBJECT)
         (a) 'He ate it yesterday.'
         (b) ' He ate yesterday. 'An uninflected verb cannot be the final word in a sentence (7.5), hence eg.
adorni must still follow the verb when the object is omitted in (21).",[155]
"The generic weather word vù has a range of meanings including 'earth,
world, land, state of weather'; it also carries some implications of a
supernatural force, fate, or deity.(73)     vu     ö-ΐε        ßa      m        kö
         fate   3-want      INC     BEN     NEG(N)
         'Fate doesn't want it for us.' (eg. the inevitability of someone's
         death)When used as a subject of a weather sentence or a sentence describing the
environmental situation, the kind of weather is determined by the verb.
Verbs include dò 'roar' (for thunder), ägü 'flash' (for lightning), owl
'dawn', nl 'darken', âijgwé 'lighten', emú 'come' (for the gathering of
clouds before rain; nonpast only), ëml 'warm up', ecfße 'cool down'.(74)     va             k-ägü
         weather      3-(N)-flash
         'It (lightning) is flashing.'(75)     vu          k ò-nl

5.3.   The subject as the patient of a transitive predicate
A transitive verb characteristically assigns its subject the thematic role of
agent and its object the thematic role of patient. It is possible for the
subject instead to be assigned the patient thematic role. The effect is
similar to passive in English, though achieved by different syntactic
means.",[104]
"
4.5.4. ReduplicationThere are many situations in Ma'di sentences where a word is
immediately followed by its copy. It is not immediately obvious in many
cases whether the pair of words should be considered as a single word,
derived by a lexical process of reduplication, or as a pair of words, each of
which is a syntactically distinct item.
    The clearest case where copying involves two distinct syntactic
constituents is in verb focus, where a verb is copied and the copy placed
in final position followed by a low tone, as a way of focusing the verb.
The verb and its copy need not be adjacent, which shows that they do not
combine as a single word (19.12.1). Another fairly clearly syntactic kind
of reduplication involves reduplication of a final constituent since this can
be a phrase (eg. a postposition phrase); this is presumably a syntactic
                                    The general morphology of Ma 'di words   67process; it gives a meaning of regularity, repetition or immediacy (18.2.5).
    More clearly lexical kinds of reduplication involve adjectives and
nouns. Reduplication of an adjective gives a meaning analogous to
English -er or -ish. Thus we find ali 'short', and àiiàii 'shorter' or
'shortish, rather short'. The reduplicated adjective can then be
nominalized, for example as allai! 'a series of shortnesses' with the
characteristic tone of abstract nouns. Nouns may also be reduplicated
with a meaning similar to that of reduplicated adjectives; these
reduplicated nouns might in fact be categorially adjectives (or sentential
modifiers). Thus màdi 'person' is reduplicated as màdi màdi to mean
'like a person; in the manner typical of a person'.
    Some adjectives or sentential modifiers change meanings in
unpredictable ways when reduplicated. Pairs include mgbë 'immediately'
and mgbë mgbë 'recently'; ëzè 'a long time ago' and ëzè εζε, 'quickly,
hurriedly'; Bo 'intact' and Bo Bo (dru) 'temporarily'; tfirì or tfírí 'silent'
tßtßn 'silently'.
    Some reduplicated words have no unreduplicated base; this is true for
example of pélópéló 'house pole', where there is no *péló. Similarly
some words expressing manner exist in reduplicated forms where the
non-reduplicated morpheme does not exist as an isolated word. They
include: π π 'hurriedly' but *n; and t/e tfé 'slowly' but *f/e; and re ré
'immediately, as soon as' but *re.","[82, 83]"

19.7 Similarities between focus on an object and nonverbal
     predicationTwo of the focus strategies resemble a pair of strategies for nonverbal
predication. Thus a bare indefinite in final position or a noun phrase + ?1
in final position is either focused in a verbal clause, or is a predicate in a
nonverbal clause. A connection between focus and predication is thus
likely.
    Could the final NP or ΝΡ+?ϊ in a verbal clause be a predicate? It is
relevant to consider the possibility that these NPs are not actually the
object of the verb but instead are copies of the object. This is because the
NPs in both cases follow uninflected verbs, which can always omit their
object and have a null object instead; thus it is possible that the focused
NP is actually a copy of the true (null) pronominal object, and thus not
itself an argument. Evidence that the NP in the ΝΡ-?ϊ structure is a copy
comes also from the fact that it is clearly a copy in subject focus, where
the first or second person subject remains in place and is copied into final
position. This would all make it more plausible to claim that the focused
NP might be a predicate.    subject        verb     ( implicit object i )          predicate-NP i
    subject        verb     ( implicit object i )          predicate-NP i       7ì
    subject i      verb                                    predicate-NP i       ?1The predicate NP can be seen as the predicate in a presentational
sentence; its subject can be interpreted as coreferential with the implicit
object of the preceding verb or with the verb's overt subject.
   Two further considerations further suggest a link between focus and
predication. First, it may be possible to combine focus with bare
predication as in the following clause.

2.3.   Inflected, uninflected and directive verbsRoot sentences show distinct kinds of structures, depending on the verb,
which is inflected (1,2), uninflected (3,4) or directive (5,6). The three types
of verb are differentiated by taking different subject pronominals; the
inflected verb is prefixed by a low tone which can appear on the preceding
word's vowel, and is glossed as N-. The inflected verb is used in nonpast
sentences, and the uninflected verb in past sentences. However, if the verb
is negated, only the uninflected verb is used and the choice of negation
particle codes past or nonpast (7,8). The inflected verb is preceded by its
object or takes an object clitic. The uninflected verb (or directive verb) is
followed by its object and the object can be omitted.

"
19.1.2.     Left-dislocationVarious constituents can be left-dislocated, put at the beginning of the
sentence. This includes postposition phrases as well as the object. In
some cases a pause is required after the left-dislocated constituent.
   The object can be placed before the subject, at the beginning of the
sentence, ie. 'left dislocated'. Left-dislocation makes the object a topic,
with the rest of the sentence the comment. That is, the object is identified
542       Focus and information structure
as something which is already under discussion or a member of a set of
things which have previously been discussed. All verbs permit this. The
left-dislocated object can also be a wh-object (which always has the same
syntactic distribution as the non-wh-object).
    This left-dislocated object is best treated as a copy of the object rather
than the true object, because if the verb is inflected the left-dislocated
object must leave a clitic after the verb, and we take this clitic to be the true
object.(1)         boggu      η       Spi      kó-d3e-a        sabunì    η          sì

"   Tucker fails to appropriately distinguish nä and ?a; he says that nä is
used in ny-ongwe-a 'call him', but this is ?a and not nä (Tucker
1940:157). We note that Tucker also sometimes claims that na is present
when it is not; thus his ...nä ndrägä (1940: 157) should actually be
analyzed as ni ändrä-ga, with vowel elision.

            Sentences with nonverbal predicates
In this chapter we look at sentences without verbs where the predicate is a
noun phrase, adjective phrase or postposition phrase. Definite and
indefinite noun phrases have different syntactic structures in predication.
We argue that nonverbal predication, like verbal predication involves both
a pronominal subject and optionally also an adjoined subject. We look at
the tense of sentences with nonverbal predication, and conclude with an
examination of the grammatical word drìi.","[233, 234, 235]"
"These constructions with the indefinite subject are called 'passive' by
Tucker (1940: 71, 214).

4.4.3. Consonants do not affect one anotherThere is no consonant harmony; consonants do not affect one another
within a word. Note incidentally that consonants are never adjacent either
within a word or across a word boundary because of the structure of the
syllable.
                                     The general morphology of Ma 'di words   654.5.     The general morphology of Ma'di words4.5.1. PrefixesPrefixes are found primarily in verbs. They include:       (i) The full range of subject pronominal prefixes (which we call the
       U-paradigm pronouns, 7.2.1.1). These harmonize to the root.       (ii) Productive derivational prefixes, which express ventive (e-) and
       iterative (υ-) meanings, and some less productive prefixes expressing
       causative (i-). All these prefixes are underlyingly unspecified for
       ATR and harmonize to the ATR value of the verb root. There is also
       systematic raising of the final tone of the verb to high when one of
       the three prefixes is present. Where the tone is not raised in some
       verbs with ύ-, this is also systematic (and carries specific meanings;
       see 5.1.2.3).       (iii) Several prefixes consist just of floating tones: a high tone
       expressing an indefinite subject pronominal, and a low tone used in
       various nonpast contexts, and possibly also a low tone used in
       directives (9.2.1.1).
There are also possible instances of the prefixes 1- (attaching to vowel-
initial nouns) and o- in some deverbal nouns, mainly cognate objects
(5.2.1). We suggest in this grammar that the prefixes can combine, with
the derivational prefix (ii) closest to the verb, preceded by a third person
subject pronominal prefix (i) - which however deletes - and which in turn
can be preceded by a prefix such as the high tone indefinite (iii).","[80, 81]"
"There are no differences in length between consonants (unlike, for
example, some neighbouring Nilotic languages such as Lango). We note
that Tucker (1940:109) has Ma'di words with [nz]. At least in
contemporary Lokai this consonant does not exist, though there is the
possibility of a language change in this respect; his example nza 'thick'
should now be nc/ja, his example onzu 'thin' should now be óndsú and
his example n[d]zete      now has the form nd^ëte 'a swampy place';
similarly his suffix nzi should be nd^l (Tucker 1940:129).",[44]
"
19.3.2.3.      A structure involving subject focus and a demonstrativeNote the following structure, which involves subject focus, and a
demonstrative (either ìledì or cñ could be substituted for na). The context
for these examples is as follows: Supposing there are signs of trouble in
the neighbourhood. To advise against getting involved in it, a speaker may
say (57) in general terms but (58) when the person going to investigate is
a known troublemaker herself.(57)    jú       mü                                     ófá         εΐό-τε

            'You are going to look for a fight.' (You will probably get into
            problems.)(58)    p¡       mü   jü           TÍ         na        Sfa         εΐό-re

            'You are going, if it is you, to look for a fight.' (you will
            definitely get into problems)
19.4 Object focus particle áuáü places focus on any kind of object, of an inflected, uninflected or
directive verb. Thus it is much wider in the range of objects it can focus
than is ?i. In general, it seems to be used primarily for contrastive focus
(less narrow contrast than with ?J), though it seems also to be used for
general broad presentational focus.
    áü must follow the verb and is normally sentence-final but can be
followed for example by a postposition phrase.(59)    ópi           ká   máηgà         e-d3¡                áü        endrè              m

"There is apparent optionality when the noun phrase contains a
demonstrative or the determiner n. In these cases, ni is sometimes used
and sometimes not. However, we argue in 12.10.1 that this optionality is
only apparent and that in these phrases the presence of ni is a result of the
syntactic presence of a phonologically concealed LOW determiner.
    We propose that ni and pi are pronominale and the noun phrase is pre-
adjoined to them. This is the same as our analysis of ?i, and resembles the
relation between the adjoined subject and the true pronominal subject of a
verb. We suggest that ni might possibly be related to the 'default' (NS

are coreferential. The noun phrase to which the phrase is attached may be
subject of verb, object of verb, or subject of a non-verbal predicate. The

Sudanic languages, with conclusions which we take to be more or less
along the same lines. Thus Crazzarola (1960: 43) says that Logbara ni
""refers back to a noun in the sentence or to an object in the view or in the
mind of the speaker, especially when it is the object of some
postposition"" And Lojenga (1994) says that Ngiti ni (a cognate?) is a
'resumptive marker', whose function is ""to resume the noun or noun
phrase after a brief pause which gives it slightly more emphasis"". There
is in contrast no pause in Ma'di between the noun phrase and nl.
    It is worth noting that there is another Ma'di word nl which is used to
express indefinite possession; it is preceded by an indefinite and is part of
an indefinite noun phrase. We discuss this in 13.1.1.1, where we suggest
that this is an unrelated word which is related instead to the benefactive
postposition ni.","[279, 280, 281]"

13.1.1.1.       Possessive ni vs. grammatical niThe pronominal ni is used after noun phrases with the definite and
specific determiner LOW, and is obligatory when such noun phrases are
in object and nonverbal subject positions. This ni, which we call
'grammatical ni' is unable to follow an indefinite noun phrase. In
contrast, possessive ni can only follow an indefinite. We suggest that the
two kinds of ni are different words, accidental homophones.(14)    ìtù                 àtfi
            sun           hot
            'The sun is hot.'(15)*   itu         m       àtfi
            sun    PR     hot         (grammatical m)
            'The sun is hot.'(16)    itu         m       àtfi
            sun   PR     hotness          (possessive nl )
            'The sun's hotness'There are three reasons to think that possessive ni might in fact be a
variant of the postposition ni (in contrast we suggested in 12.1.3.1 that
grammatical ni is a variant of the pronoun âni). First, it would mean that,
like the dn strategy and probably the ?a strategy, this is another example
of a postpositional strategy for possession. Second, the tonal difference
between the possessional ni and the postposition ni is parallel to the tonal
difference between the possessional ?a and the postposition ?a; in both
cases, a tone is lowered one step to get possession. Third, the Logbara
cognate is actually a high tone ni (homophonous in Logbara with the
postposition ni); Crazzarola does not treat them as the same (1960: 141).
296       Modification of the noun (including possession)    However, if ni is a variant of postposition ni, it is not only a
phonological variant but also has different selectional properties. While
postposition m takes a wide range of NP structures but requires the
complement to be animate, possessional ni takes a restricted range of NP
structures (bare noun and noun + LOW only) and has no animacy
restriction.
    These selectional properties also distinguish possessive ni from its
homophone, the ni used after specific noun phrases. It is thus likely that
while possessive ni is a postposition which is homophonous with
pronominal ni, they are not related words.","[311, 312]"

6.2.5. Morphological and syntactic similarities and differences between
       adjectives and nounsWe have classed some words as nouns and others as adjectives. It is
worth asking however whether they are all in fact nouns. This is perhaps
Tucker's view (1940: 77); he suggests that there is no distinct class of
adjectival roots, and that all adjectives are versions of nominal or verbal
roots.
   The evidence for thinking that 'adjectives' and 'nouns' might be of
the same word class is as follows, (i) They have similar tonal patterns (in
contrast to verbs). Singular nouns and adjectives both tend to end in final
high tone. Plural nouns and adjectives both tend to have an L * M pattern,
with M * another occasional option, (ii) There is no difference in the
syntactic structures of sentences which have adjectives as predicates and
which have common nouns as predicates.
   There are however also some differences between adjectives and
nouns, (i) In general, adjectives are inflected for singular or plural (the
exception is colour words). In general, nouns are not inflected for
singular or plural (the exceptions, pluralizable nouns, include kinship
terms, occupation terms and some other loanwords), (ii) While an
adjective in its role as modifier of a noun might itself be the only lexical
word in a noun phrase, that noun phrase must be accompanied by a
                                                                 Postpositions     107
determiner η, dì or nà (13.2.1). This is not a constraint holding of nouns
in general, which can stand on their own without a determiner.
    It is our view, based particularly on this last point, that adjectives are a
distinct word class in Ma'di, and we assume this in the grammar.","[122, 123]"

Transcription conventionsWe give Ma'di words in broad phonetic transcription. We follow the
International Phonetic Alphabet, except that we use a nonstandard
transcription for vowels for ease of reading, and imitating Lojenga (1994):                 Non-back (& non-round)         Back (& round)

                            Introduction
This is a grammar of the Ma'di language, more specifically of the Lokai
dialect of Ma'di. Lokai is the native dialect of one of the authors,
Blackings. Ma'di is a Central Sudanic language of the Nilo-Saharan
phylum, spoken in the south of the Sudan and north of Uganda. This
chapter describes the general sociolinguistic situation of the language.","[16, 17]"
"1.8.     Previous research relating to Ma'diThe earliest published work on Ma'di is probably Molinaro (1925). The
major surveys of Tucker (1940) and Tucker and Bryan (1966) include
sections on Ma'di. There are dictionaries for Ma'di by Bilbao and
Ferrazin (nd), Ferrazin (1996), and Blackings (2000). Linguistic work on
Ma'di phonetics and phonology includes Andersen (1986), Demolin and
Goyvaerts (1986) and Kilpatrick (1985). Linguistic work on Ma'di
syntax includes Andersen and Goyvaerts (1986), Blackings (1988),
Watson (1997) and Andersen (1998). Surveys which include material on
Ma'di include Greenberg (1966), Demolin (1988), Heine and Nurse
(2000). Work on other Central Sudanic languages which we have found
useful includes Andersen (1984, 1987), and Vallaeys (1991, and nd).
Crazzarola (1960) is titled A study of the Logbara (Ma'di) language.
Grammar and vocabulary but despite the title is not a grammar of
Ma'di; Logbara is a distinct but quite closely related language within the
                                      Previous research relating to Ma 'di   11Moru-Ma'di family. Djuruni (1983) is a useful study of Logbara by a
native speaker (and critical of Crazzarola). Lojenga's (1994) grammar of
Ngiti is the only detailed previous grammar of a Central Sudanic
language; we have found this grammar very useful and make occasional
comparisons with Ngiti where they seem relevant.

                      An overview of Ma'di2.1.   Sound structurePoints of note about Ma'di consonants are that there are many
secondarily and doubly articulated consonants and there are implosi ves.
There is little allophonic variation. Vowels show Advanced Tongue Root
harmony. There are three tones: high, mid and low. Some morphemes
consist just of floating tones. Vowel and tone deletion takes place, and
may result in the surface concealment of grammatical morphemes such as
pronominals and inflection. Syllables are CV or V. There are few
restrictions on combinations of consonants with vowels.","[26, 27, 28, 29]"

8.2.1.2. Omission of the subject pronominalThe normally obligatory pronominal subject can be omitted in sentences
like the following, with an inflected verb and an object clitic which is
coreferential with an implied subject (and with an adjoined lexical
subject).(15)    jiä-ä                  wà
        N-eat-OBJ      PS
        'It can be eaten.'(16)    lätu           tü-ä                  dim
        dance          N-dance-OBJ          like this
         'This is how dance is danced.' (how people dance)
8.2.1.3. ká is a pronominal and not an auxiliary verbThe morpheme ká is classified by Tucker (1940: 187) as an auxiliary
verb. We think this is incorrect and treat ká as a pronominal. As some
crosslinguistic support for this we note that Lojenga (1994: 196) treats
the cognate kä in Ngiti as a third person pronoun, justified further for
Ngiti by the fact that kä is also a third person object pronoun (unlike
Ma'di), and can be used in a wider range of tenses and aspects.
160    The inflected verb
8.2.2. The adjoined subjectThe pronominal subject can be preceded by a noun phrase or pronominal
which we call the 'adjoined subject' and which is coreferential with the
pronominal subject; it is found with all forms of the verb.
   It is just possible (eg. in storytelling register) to separate the adjoined
lexical subject and the (true, pronominal) subject, which raises the
possibility that they do not together form a constituent. (This is seen also
with the uninflected verb.)(17)     opi                        endru      ka        eßl      dì

         O p i today is cooking fish.' (storytelling register)
8.3.   Object
8.3.1. The object precedes the inflected verbThe inflected verb is preceded by its object (unlike the uninflected verb
which is followed by its object).(18)    ká             ¿61              àzi
         3             fish             (N)-sell

15.12.     'Grammatical' location nounsWhere a location word can take a preceding complement (the located
thing), we suggest two alternative possibilities as to structure. Some
location words are, we argue, true postpositions; others are nouns which
are pre-possessed by the locations. The postpositions take the preceding
noun phrases as complements, and in general must have a preceding
complement. The location nouns are in general possessed by the
preceding noun (often with full possession syntax), and in general can
stand without a preceding 'located' noun phrase; many of the location
nouns must be embedded under the postposition gá.
   These are the words we consider to be location nouns rather than
postpositions:Table 44. Nouns of location.

8.3.2.2. DistributionThe object pronoun ?ä is attached as a postclitic to the inflected verb, and
is often combined with the preceding verb as a single word, with the
glottal stop lost, thus taking the form -a.

when the verb is inflected.

1.1.1. Other peoples and languages sometimes called 'Ma 'di ' 'Ma'di' has also been used to describe other peoples and other
languages in the area. Thus for example a common tendency especially in
the Acholi area of northern Uganda is to refer to anyone from West Nile
Region as a Ma'di, even the Kakwa; the only group in this region who
are never called Ma'di are the Alur. Tucker (1940: 5) describes the
Kaliko ""who occupy the high plateau in the southern Yei River District
under Chief Aluma"" (in Sudan on the West side of the Nile, near the
Logbara) as having the ""real name Ma'di"". We are not sure of the basis
for Tucker's claim: these people are and still regard themselves as Kaliko
rather than as Ma'di. Fr. Crazzolara (1960: v) also makes a similar claim
about the Logbara when he says ""all Logbara, however, agree that they
are of the Ma'di nation, that they are Ma'di. They are called Ma'di by the
Aluur of Okooro, their immediate neighbours, in Bunyoro and
Buganda."" Again, we are not sure of the truth of this claim, at least at the
present time. Another group which is a possible source of confusion is
the Ma'di-Indri (midi ìndrì literally 'goat Ma'di') of Rhino Camp, Arua
District, Uganda; they are at times called Ma'di Okolo. Their other
neighbours, the Nilotic Alur, refer to them as Ma'di-Dyel (literally 'Goat
Ma'di') and the Bantu, Banyoro call them Abatembuzi (literally 'Goat
2      Introductionpeople'). Despite the name similarity, the group are administratively in
Arua District of the Logbara people rather than Moyo or Adjumani
Districts of the Ma'di people and speak a language which more closely
resembles Logbara than Ma'di. We note that Tucker and Bryan (1966:
36) suggest that ma- is a 'tribal prefix' used in some languages in the
region to name either the 'tribe' itself (mangbetu, meje, mamvu, ma'dì)
or another 'tribe' (e.g. the Mamvu word ma-zande 'a Zande').","[17, 18]"
"This is of particular interest when we consider that if the object follows
the verb, the verb + object combination is no longer contrastively negated.
This suggests that the verb + object combination do not together constit-
ute a phrase (a verb phrase), though it leaves open the possibility that the
object + verb combination is a verb phrase.(214)   e-djí              galámu       kö

                              AdverbialeWe use the term 'adverbial' to group words (and lexicalized phrases and
clauses) by function. In this chapter we separate kinds of adverbials, into
sections depending on their syntactic behaviour; we have not found clear
correlations between syntactic and semantic characteristics of the different
kinds of adverbial. Adverbials can be freely placed in the clause, fixed in
final position or fixed in initial position. We separately consider temporal
nouns, subordinate clauses functioning as adverbials, and adverbials
which have a discourse function rather than a syntactic role.","[492, 493]"
