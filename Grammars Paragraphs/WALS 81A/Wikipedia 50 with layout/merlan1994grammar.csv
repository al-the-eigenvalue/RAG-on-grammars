10.2. Information units, given/new and theme/rheme contrastsHalliday (1985 and earlier) suggests that two major dimensions of textual organization
in English have to do with ""information"" and ""thematisation"" (see also McGregor 1990
for application of Hallidayan concepts to the Western Australian language Gooniyandi).
Information is concerned wit ι the given/new opposition, and thematisation with the
theme/rheme, or topic/comm:nt, opposition. He further suggests that information
structure is primarily expressed prosodically, while the thematic structure is realised
through constituent order. In the previous section I suggested the importance of
considering constituency and prosody in relation to each other, in order to achieve a
descriptive scheme which delimits phrase structure and ordering possibilities within the
phrase in a meaningful way. For present purposes, I consider the use of prosodically
defined units to be one of the most helpful methodological offerings of the Halliday
framework, mainly because it provides an opening into the study of the interaction
between grammaticality and other levels of the organization of text.
  Halliday (1985: 274) observes that an information unit does not correspond exactly to
any unit in the clause grammar, but other things being equal, tends to be coextensive with
one clause, as the ""default"" ccndition in English. Each information unit is realized as a
pitch contour, or TONE, which extends over the whole tone group. Within the tone group,
one foot or syllable carries thi main pitch movement, and the element which has this
feature of tonic prominence is said to carry the information focus. The tonic foot marks
where the 'new' element of information ends. Halliday (1985:277) considers information
that is presented by the speaker as recoverable as ""given"", and that which is presented
as not recoverable to be ""new"".
  The Wardaman texts appended to this grammar were realized as sequences of tone units.
Each such unit is identified by number. Many are short and occupy only one line. The
main criterion for identifying ;i tone unit is on the basis that it is bounded by significant
pitch movement, either a rise or a fall. Typically, such a unit is also bounded by short
226 Chapter 10 pause, but the presence of pause is not in itself defining of a tone group. In some cases
 it is ambiguous whether a particular stretch of speech is best identified as two tone units
 or as one. This is especially the case where it appears that there may be some pitch
 movement at the possible tone unit boundary, but pitch remains relatively constant
 (compared to other instances). In other words, questions of identification may arise
 because intonational phenomena are perceived as a matter of degree. The temptation to
 identify a separate tone unit may be strengthened where there is also pause at such a
 possible boundary, but as noted above, pause in itself is not definitional of the tone unit.
    As McGregor (1990: 362) notes for Gooniyandi, tone units in Wardaman do not
 necessarily correspond to grammatical units, although they do so in particular cases. As
has often been noted for Australian languages (and as in the Moon Dreaming text, above),
a single nominal word may frequently be found on a tone unit of its own, set apart from
 other constituents to which it is meaningfully linked. Because nominal and other words
are frequently set off in this way on their own tone unit, a number of such units together
may contain the information that might otherwise be contained within a clause. At the
same time, it may often happen, as Halliday has shown for English, that a tone group will
be equivalent to a clause, as for the Moon Dreaming group ""he speared the kangaroo
with joey"". In the case of smaller constituent units which may comprise part of a clause,
I make the assumption that while whatever set of nominal words occurs on a single tone
unit may comprise (one or more) noun phrases, it is not legitimate to assume that nominal
constituents occurring in different tone groups constitute part of the same particular
phrase (although the same actual forms may occur elsewhere as part of a phrase on a
single tone group). Thus, in the above Moon Dreaming example, mangali 'female' and
wurre-warang cannot be regarded as part of the same noun phrase, even though these
two words might occur together elsewhere within a tone unit and as part of a noun phrase.
That is, I am prepared to use occurrence on a single tone unit as a minimum condition,
necessary but not sufficient, for the identification as a noun phrase of any given set of
nominal words.
   Following Grimes (1975) and others, it is possible to suggest that there is a distinction
to be made between more central or primary tone units, and secondary ones (see
McGregor 1990: 364). In such a scheme, the primary unit may be defined by greater
prominence of its salient syllable, and by greater pitch movement over the contour. A
secondary unit, whatever its precise character, may be defined as in association with a
primary one, and generally characterized negatively, by lesser syllable salience and lesser
pitch movement. McGregor (1991: 365) suggests for Gooniyandi that the primary unit
normally contains the propositional nexus: the verbal complex in clauses with verbs.
Further, secondary units normally consist of a single clausal constituent: NP, adverbial,
or other. McGregor goes on to hypothesize the existence of a tonic sentence, defined as
a primary unit in association with one or more optional secondary ones. In information
terms, the secondary unit(s) tend(s) to elaborate the primary one, or otherwise convey
information closely related to that of the primary unit. I have not put this plausible
distinction between primary and secondary units to work in this description, that is, units
in the texts are not identified as primary or secondary. I would only note that the
distinction might be profitably elaborated as a set of typical primary-secondary tone unit
                                                        Issues in constituency and word order 227
nexus types; for example, there is a prosodic relation of dependency between the
(typically short and unelaboraied) tone units containing a ""say"" verb, and the unit(s)
which realize the reported speech which the verb projects.
  There follows consideration of the constituency of the noun phrase, and in 10.8. a
summary of noun phrase structire types. This is given together with discussion of normal
ordering within the phrase. While no doubt further meaningful distinctions made by
ordering remain to be discerned, it is suggested that regular meaningful differences in
the presentation of information appear to be associated in some instances with the
difference between the orders: demonstrative determiner followed by nominal, versus
nominal followed by demonstrative determiner (DEM + N versus N + DEM). I will
propose that this difference may be seen as part of the organization of difference between
unmarked and marked Theme types, that is, less or more remarkable organization of what
any particular tone unit or sequence of them is ""about"". A further introductory word may
be useful here about the notion of theme.
  Again following Halliday (1935:278-279) in his elaboration of Firthian and Pragueian
notions, thematic structure may be defined as that dimension in which is organized what
a stretch of speech is about. Theme is commonly defined as (1) the point of departure
of what the speaker has to say, or more fully, (2) what the speaker is talking about, the
topic; while Rheme is commonly defined as the completion of this point of departure, or
the comment. Obviously, the £ iven/new contrast may interact closely with the theme/
rheme one, in that, for example, it is possible for something to be presented as either an
expected or unexpected, a givei or not given, point of departure.
  Finally, we will need to consider how to approach the question of the presence and
ordering of nominal constituents of clause-level syntactic function, intransitive Subject,
transitive Object, and ergative-marked Agent. It is common enough for such functions
to be marked only on the verb within any given tone unit, that is, for there to be no overt
nominal expression of any given major clause function. Some discussion of lexical
realization of these functions is thus required, because case-marking of them is obviously
dependent upon their occurrence. But beyond that, is it possible to say that an occurring
nominal typically precedes or :bllows the verb of which it is the object? To the extent
that the agent of a transitive verb is realized by a nominal expression, where does this
occur with respect to the verb1; We will see that the ergative-marked agent is the least
frequently occurring of the three syntactic types, and that there is a tendency for all three
to occur preceding the verbal word or words; but that this tendency is apparently strongest
for nouns and noun phrases in intransitive subject function, noticeable but not extreme
for ergative-marked transitive igents, and least noticeable for transitive objects, which
occur both pre- and post-verba ly with more nearly equal frequency.","[249, 250, 251]"
"
10.10. The ordering of object, agent and subjectIn 10.1. I suggested that it is not possible to approach certain questions of word order
with only the issue of ""grammaticality"" in mind, in Wardaman and other Australian
languages. Informants, when asked, will approve different orders within the phrase and
the elicitation sentence as grammatically acceptable and meaningful. But another matter
is what they will actually say themselves, with all the attendant questions of relative
frequency of different orders, and the meaningful organization of textual matter. The
clause is the understood unit of analysis with respect to which summaries of major
constituent ordering are usually made (as in formulae such as SVO, SOV etc.). But this
assumes that issues of ordering are fundamentally issues of clause-level grammatical
structure. There are however many other issues besides grammaticality which have to
do with the occurrence and ordering of nominal constituents.
  Some observations drawn from text material will be summarized here about the
positioning of the direct object, the ergative-marked transitive agent, and the intransitive
subject. These observations were made on text material that had been organized into
tone units. As I noted above this chapter, this organization was basic in that no thorough
analysis into primary and secondary intonation units was made, although such further
study seems promising. Rather, a simple division into tone units or contours was made
on the main criterion of pitch movement (generally but not always strongly linked with
pause phenomena). Once this is done, it becomes possible to talk about ordering of overt
noun phrases fulfilling major syntactic functions within the tone unit and with respect to
an occurring verb.
  There is an important general issue of the lexical realization of participants. The other
side of the coin is ellipsis (and what may be somewhat different, failure for participants
to be lexically specified through local portions of text, a more general question of
narrative style that will not be further discussed). The fact that two nominal functions
may be marked on the inflecting Wardaman verb by pronominal prefixes is linked to the
                                                        Issues in constituency and word order 247
 fact of extensive nominal ellipsis particularly of nominals in intransitive and transitive
 subject functions.
    For instance, in the text Jalijbang, the protagonist Moon is introduced lexically in unit
 (1) by his subsection, Yiwalyarri, but is not designated again lexically until unit (83),
where he is referred to as gandawag 'moon'. By that time he has been the understood
 agent of 31 transitive constructions and numerous intransitive ones. There is only one
 occurrence of an ergative-marked noun in the entire text of 110 units, at 102 where
 Moon's wives return, figure out what has happened, and say, Oh! here the old man-ERG
 is keeping/has his mother-in-law. The relatively straightforward story-line as told, one
 might say, makes it possible for Moon to be the understood and largely ellipsed agent
 and subject of numerous transitive and intransitive verbs (and, interestingly, in this story
 the object of none).
   In the text Gawalyan, the first main character introduced is echidna herself. She is
 identified by the single noungawalyan 'echidna' on the first tone unit of the text. This
 is not ergative-marked, despite the fact that the next unit gives the information ""She had
 a small child"". The naming of echidna simply identifies her, and carries no clear
 indication of grammatical function. Such naming as the content of a tone unit, amounting
to apposition of participants rather than specification of grammatical function, is a
 common feature of Wardaman text. In the Gawalyan text, echidna is not lexically
identified again until line 26, where some birds ask her husband to lend his wife
 fyingawuyu) to them for sexual intercourse. This request, with lexical designation of
echidna as ""wife"", is repeated in line 28. Then there is no further lexical identification
of echidna until a final one in line 43, where she is described as having beenyibarnbarnin
'naked, hairless', until she was speared for refusing the birds, and so acquired quills.
There is no instance of ergative-marked agent in the entire text; for after the aggressor
birds have been lexically identified once (in lines 22 and 23, on tone units which name
them in absolutive case form), they are designated only by pronominal prefixes (subject
and object) on the verb throughout the remainder of the text.
   The two cases above might be among the texts where there is least lexical designation
of protagonists, and reference maintenance to protagonists principally through
pronominal prefixation. A text which shows more considerable lexical specification of
protagonists is Gumurrinji and Bornorron ""Emu and Brolga"". Here, emu asks brolga to
mind her children along with brolga's own while emu goes out foraging, and as in some
Shakespearean plots, there is ample possibility for confusioa Perhaps for that reason,
emu is lexically designated 6 times in a relatively short text, as is brolga; three of the
latter occurrences are Ergative-marked, as brolga maliciously destroys emu's children
while she is away. Nevertheless there is no case in which both agent and object are
lexically specified on the same tone unit, and thus no specific evidence for the ordering
of ""brolga"" and ""emu"" with respect to each other as lexemes in particular major syntactic
functions. Overall, lexical specification of agent and object in the same tone unit is rare
textually, but there are instances (such as Dalyarra line 30, ""two-ERG women- ERG held
her legs-ABS on either side"", or the order AVO).
   In attempting to calculate the occurrence of overt nominals as agents, subjects and
objects, it seemed important to distinguish cases in which they occurred within the same
248 Chapter 10tone unit as the verbal word(s) bearing pronominal agreement, versus those in which they
occurred on another tone group (often, set off as simple nouns or nominal expressions
on a tone unit by themselves in absolutive form, or sometimes with case specification).
Table 18 shows tabulations derived from 24 texts of nominal (including pronominal)
elements in given functions — as direct objects, intransitive subjects, and (ergative-
marked) agents, and their position pre- or post-verbally within the tone unit.","[270, 271, 272]"
"
8.20. Copula verbs
  Two finite verbs function as copulas, jingi- and yu-. The former is also a full lexical
verb ""sit"" (and may also occur with particle duba in this meaning). In many instances
copular kinds of constructions in Wardaman do not involve the use of any finite verb.
                                                                Categories of the finite verb 213For example, as noted in 5.7., semantically adjectival nominate may occur with article
suffix forming complements, the subject of which is understood from the pronominal
adjunct of a proximate finite verb:(512)   wudu-wi                   nganburr-ga-ndi...
        little-ABS-ART            3NSG/lSG-take-PST
        'When I was little they took me ...'
  The verb yu- is less common tYianjingi-, both in predications of being and existence
(in a place), and in particle plus verb combinations. This is related to its being defective.
As noted in 8.16., it has only present tense form yu- and non-past subordinate form
yungga, forms ofjingi- occurring elsewhere. It also has a reduplicative present tense
form, yuju-. Besides serving (rarely) as copula, yu-, is also found as supporting verb in
a number of particle plus finite verb combinations. Any particle which may occur with
yu- may also occur withy wg/-, although certain particles (see below) preferentially occur
with yu- in the Present tense. In a few combinations with particle it seems that the verb
may sometimes express the meaning of ""lie"", or (with inanimate clausal subjects) ""be on
the ground"", but this semantic element is certainly not evident in many combinations.
  Particles with which yu- has been recorded in combination include: geleng 'shine, be
shiny'; lirrngang-ma 'smile, laugh'; mengmeng-ma 'be an expanse, spread out, cover,
be in flower' (typically used of expanses of water or flat plains, and in the last sense of
plants); mirrng-ma 'have a headache'; ngarralang-ma 'stand poised, with paws up';
ngidgid-ba 'whimper'; \varrba 'rest'; word-bo, 'sit with head out, only head visible';
narrangarl-ma 'protrude, stick up';juba 'be deaf; gunurd-ba 'be glad'.

                    Other aspects of word formation
9.1. Introduction: Historical layersThere remain a few significant aspects of word, and mainly nominal, morphology to be
discussed in this chapter. Some of these are isolated, or attested in only a few forms (like
the prefix nya-, see 9.6.), and may be assumed to be remnants of old processes of word
formation, now fairly marginal. Others, however, like nominal formation with the suffix
•ban ~ -man, are not only clearly old, but were thorough-going in the language, as the
large number of relatable forms attests.
9.2. -ban ~ -war/, adjectival suffixA nominal-forming suffix of reasonably frequent occurrence is -ban ~ -wan, which is
attested suffixed both to verb particles/adverbs and to nominals, creating derived forms
which are either semantically adjectival, and/or characterized by perfective passive
meaning. This ending is only moderately productive.
  Some forms with this suffix include: burrgburrg-bari 'piebald, spotted'; nyabnyab-
(b)ari 'sticky' (from nyab); walig-bari 'around, all around' (from adverbial walig
'around'); gorlorlogba-wari 'straight' (related to gorlorlogba 'straight'); gun.garr-wari
'what type?' 'what kind?' (cf. gun.garr-ma, 7.5.5.); derrema-wari 'crawling, crawler'
from the particle derre-ma; and yarralma-wari 'untidy, unkempt' (related to particle
yarralma, 'stand up, be unkempt, untidy').
  Sometimes the suffix derives a form of a different word class from the base form, e.g.,
nyabnyab-(b)ari 'sticky' is derived from particle nyab-(b)a 'to stick to'; and yarralma-
wari 'unkempt' from particle yarralma 'to be unkempt'. However, sometimes
suffixation does not clearly result in a change in word class, e.g., compare:(517a)    walig         yanja               gunya              ye-0-geng-ma
          around        3SG-go-PRES         3SG-DISS           3-3SG-fear-PRES(517b)    walig-bari              yanja               gunya              ye-0-geng-ma
          around-NOM              3SG-go-PRES         3SG-DISS           3-3SG-fear-PRES
         'He's going around away from him, he fears him'.
  In such instances there is little clear ground for describing the suffix as ""nominalizing""
(or indeed, as ""derivational""), since the resulting form has the same possibilities of
occurrence as the base form. Note also gorlorlogban 'straight' and gorlorlogba-wari
'straight' are equally descriptors. There is seemingly a difference in syntactic flexibility
of regular nominal constructions as compared to these: those with -ban ~ -wari are not
216 Chapter 9commonly attested with case suffocation (although inquiry reveals that informants
consider case-suffixed forms of them acceptable).
  The subtly more nominal character of gun.garr-wari as compared togun.garr-nia may
be appreciated from the fact that the latter may be used to question the manner of action,
""how?"". It may, however, also be used to ask about the nature of something, e.g.,
gun.garr-im tmdin 'what's the word?' 'what's the news?' etc. Gun.garr-wari, on the
other hand, is used only as adnominal interrogative:(518)   gej-ba        nga-gi-ndi        nuilurru
        ask-PS        1SG-AUX-PST       old woman-ABS
        barnagbarnang         gun.garr-wari           nwgulu
        aunt rdp              what kind-NOM           yam-ABS
        gaba gaba nyanga jurd-ba            nga-bu-wa        yinggi
        here here     come      show-PS     1SG-AUX-FUT      2SG-DAT
        Ί asked the old lady
        ""Auntie? What sort of thing is niagitlu?""
        ""Here here come, I'll show you"" '.
  Two different kinds of textual occurrences of -ban are worth citing to further illustrate
its functional range. In a text about bushlore, the speaker is describing plants which
Aborigines used to collect and use for fish poisons. Allative forms of ""here"" and ""that
way"" are found suffixed as follows:(519)   menjen         nianda-gan          geler ruga
        [plant]        what-Q              [plant]
        dann-rlan-bari
        here-AI^NGM
        dawu-rlan-bari            gelerrnga
        that way-AUy-NOM          [plant]
        'Barringtonia and what's-it Strychnos
         towards this way
          and that way Strychnos'.
  Here, -ban seems to make more concrete the notion of a region or area in the direction
indicated, and thus a nominalizing sort of value.
  In another text the speaker talks of evil glances, or ""evil eye"", which might keep a
pregnant woman from delivering her child easily and in good time. She describes such
a woman as follows:(520) yi-birrba     bangbun        nana
      YI-old-ABS    woman-ABS      that-ABS
      burruga-wun-bari     gayawun-bi
      long ago-NOM-NOM while-AKT
        ' That is an ""old"" woman [' old' =one pregnant for a time already]
          a long-term one, still a while [to go] ...'.
                                                            Other aspects of word formation 217
  Here the suffix occurs on burruga-, which usually occurs with article suffix as
burruga-wi in the meaning 'a long time ago, a long while, long before'. Although
seemingly essentially adverbial, burruga- is here suffixed with what looks like
nominal-forming -gim ~-wun (see 9.4.), but which may also be analyzed as a reduced
form of the Source case ending - wunba, which has been contracted with the ending -ban,
producing a form meaning 'a long-term (person)'.
  Examples of this suffix with v ;rb particles, which show the perfective passive semantic
most clearly, include: iromdog-ba 'split, halve, cut', dog-bari 'halved, split one'; from
bag-ba 'break', bag-ban 'broten one'; from dorlb-(b)a 'drop', dorlb-(b)ari 'dropped
one'; from dulyurr-nm' break, Irnrst', diilyurrma-wari' burst one'. From nominals, note
also the following derivations: from wengman 'empty', wengnian-bari 'emptied, empty,
having been emptied5; iromja.nam 'fuu',jamam-bari 'full, filled one'; and related to
both verb particle jubad 'be diaf' and adjectival nominal yi-jubad 'deaf', jubad-bari
'deaf, deafened one'. Such derived forms do not occur with nominal class prefixes
(though they are, as noted abo\ e, acceptable with case endings). They tend to occur in
absolutive form, for example:(521)   dog-ban          nganu-wo-n
        split-NOM        2NSG/lSG-give-PRES
        ' Give me the halved ons/give me that bit'.
93. -man ~ -ban, nominal-forming suffixThere are many nominals in Wiirdaman that have a final syllable -man or -ban, which is
discussed in 11.1.2., and seems to be relatable to the particle suffix -ba ~ -ma. This
suggestion is supported by the fact that from a considerable number of particles, nominals
can be derived by the additio:i of the noun-forming -n (the same element which is
commonly deleted in final syllable reduction, see 3.4.): for example, from particle
bilili-nra 'be slippery' is derivei the nominal bililiman 'slippery', and so forth.
  This seems indicative of forner, highly productive derivational processes in which
many roots could variably function as verb particles, or as nominals, the former
seemingly morphologically basic. In the contemporary language, however, there are
large numbers of nominals ending in -ntan or -ban that cannot be related to any verb
particle. It is possible that corresponding verb particles, or at least some, may have
formerly existed but have dropped out of the lexicon, and that along with this went the
thorough installation in the hinguage of -man ~ -ban as part of an historical, but
decreasingly productive, structure of nominal formatioa
  The suffix -man ~ -ban occirs as part of the nominal suffix -gujban - -wujban (see
11.3.1.), but there is a clear encugh semantic contrast between the former and the latter.
The latter suffix is very produc live especially with a large range of finite verb roots and
verb particles in the formation of agentive nominals, i.e., ones that generally designate
""agent that does X"", where X is an activity (e.g., bu-yi-wujban 'fighter' from bit-;
nyerreng-ma-wujban 'noise-maker' from nyerreng-ma 'make noise', and so on). In
218 Chapter 9 contrast, the former suffix is found in all sorts of nominal stems which designate either
 non-agentive substantives, conditions, and the like (dalbirrman 'tough, hard', goyogban
  Orphan', langman 'plain, clear place', wujaban 'house', megerrman 'long yam',
 ngigilman 'straight, wabulman 'light-weight', etc.); or occurs in a large range of animal
 and other natural species terms. Some of the latter are clearly onomatopoetic, but the
 character of the formation, in contrast to that with -gujban ~ -wujban, seems not agentive
 but rather descriptive of inherent quality or characteristic (which may include typical
 noise or sound made). Among such forms are: nilngman 'finch', gorrgorrman
 'kookaburra', jerrman 'wrens', jibilyuman 'whistle duck', jorrerrngman 'kingfisher',
jorlborrman 'butcher bird'. See however also: burariman 'bluetongue' (dry country);
 gurrbljlnman 'python'; and even gangman 'plains kangaroo', where natural species
 terms are clearly not imitative. There is as yet no sustainable etymology for the suffix

9.4. -gun ~ -wun, nominal suffixAlso clearly old, and now only moderately productive, is the suffix -gun ~ -wun. Now,
this seems to mainly serve to create semantically adjectival nominals meaning
""pertaining to X"", e.g., laglan 'country, place' and yi-lagla-wun 'indigene, belonging to
place'; wungij 'darkness, night' and yi-wungij-gun 'pertaining to night, nocturnal,
belonging to darkness'; mernden 'ghost, white person' and mernde-wun 'European,
pertaining to ghosts'; ngurruwun 'hot weather' and ngurruwun-gun 'perennial' (of water,
i.e., lasting through the hot season). Less commonly, a suffix perhaps relatable to this
one been found with a small number (3) of verb particles with particle suffix, to create a
derived form which also functions as particle, and which is not distributionally or
semantically clearly distinguishable from the base particle form; see examples following.
                                                                Other aspects of word formation 219
  This suffix is found used with certain common nouns which designate social categories,
to create kinds of gentilic formations. For example, one of the matrifiliatively-
transmitted ngurlu categories (see 1.3.) is goyln 'sugar bag', or 'wild honey'. In the text
Galapin a woman speaks of hjr affiliation with this category, creating with the suffix
under discussion a form meaning ""belonging to/affiliated with honey"", as follows:(522) yi-guyu-wunba                 nganu                goyin                yani-tna
      YI-mother-SOU                  ISO-DAT             honey-ABS            thus-PS
      yi-goyi-wun              yirntg
      YI-honey-NOM             1E:CNSG-ABS
        'From my mother, I an ι honey, like this
         we are honey people'.
   Forms with this suffix may be further case- and adverbially-inflected, viz. in the text
 Galapin the phrase mad-bar ""a mernde-\vun-barra 'in/by means of the European
 mernde-wun) language (madin)', with adverbial suffix -barra (see 5.4.).
   There is some indication of the antiquity of this suffix in the language, in the fact, for
 example, thatthe 'lacking' suffix wagbawun (5.3.2.) is evidently to be analyzed as wagba,
 which by itself means Orphan', or 'trash' (discarded etc.), plus this ending. Also the
 adverb and interjection gayanun 'still, yet, wait' etc. (see 9.5.1.) is composed of gaya
 'today, now' plus this suffix. Finally, a reasonable argument can be made that the
 independent genitive pronoun series contains a suffix which may be historically
 identified with the one under discussion here, viz. the relation between 1SG DAT nganu
 and 1SG GEN nganinggin, 2SG DAT yinggi and 2SG GEN yinggawun, 3SG DAT gunga
 and 3SG GEN gungan.gin, and so on. The fact that many pronouns of the independent
 genitive series have final -gin, that is with a high vowel not to be explained in terms of
 any synchronic assimilatory process, suggests that in some functions the suffix is quite
 old in the language.
   Some nominal forms which are not productive derivations, but with final syllable which
 may be relatable to this suffix, include: yi/maAvu-bujgun 'wild, undomesticated';
 dan.guyugun, nan.guyugun 'this side, that side' etc.; dilygun 'possum'; wu-jarranggun
 'pinky finger'; ma-dulgun 'bladder' (cf. dulgin 'urine'); buruwun 'killer, good hunter';
jurdbawun 'index finger' (cf.Jurd-ba, particle 'to indicate'); miyiwun 'dog'; muruwun
 'bottle tree'; wangguwarlawun 'eastern' (cf. yiyanggu 'east'); andyi-nimgajamayawun
 'last of a litter, runt' (cf. yi-nim^yo 'last-born'). It may even be the case that, historically,
 the negative ngawun contains this suffix.
    The verb particles found siffixed with -gun were: new-ma 'grab', as new-ma-gun;
gurryu-ma 'dive in', asgurryu -ma-gun; and wabirl 'peel, skin,graze' as wabirl-ma-gun.
Note that there is some proble n identifying this suffix with the nominal adjectival one,
 in that following a vowel we would expect the form of the ending to be -wun. It must
therefore be suggested that the ending found with these verb particles cannot be identified
 synchronically with the alternating ending, but it may be an historically specialized form
of it, and may in fact be relatable to that found with lege One' to create the
 morphologically irregular or isolated form lege-gun Once' (see 7.6.5.). Textual examples
of the suffixed verb particles are:

        'My father dived in for [to get] him'.
9.5. -mayin, adjectival suffixAn adjectival ending, -mayin, is attested in the word morrolng-mayin 'green, fresh
(green)'. While this ending is thus rare in Wardaman, it is of some comparative interest,
in that it occurs in other regional languages, e.g., Mangarrayi, as a suffix to cognate colour
terms (and also, in the latter language, with some other descriptive terms). Thus in
Wardaman we find belyeng-man 'red', in Mangarrayi be lye ng-may in; in Wardaman
dewo-man 'white', and in Mangarrayi dewo-mayin, 'white'.
9.6. nya-, actor prefixA few forms meaning ""one characterized by X"" or ""one who does X"" are found to be
derived from verb particles with a prefix nya-. Though fairly uncommon in Wardaman,
this prefix may very likely prove of historical-comparative interest in languages of the
region. The base and derived forms in which this prefix is attested are listed below:
Base            Gloss              Derived                         Glossgiwurrg         'be sulky'        nya-giwurrg             'sulky person, one who sulks'
ginod           'be sulky'        nya-ginod               'sulky person, one who sulks'
ganjayl         'disturb'         nya-ganjayl             'bother, ""humbug""'
yudba           'claim'           nya-yudbarraj           One who claims'
dagurrg         'peer'            nya-dagurrg             'peerer, voyeur'  The particle yudba is used to describe the action of people laying claim to things, saying
that those things are theirs, often with the connotation that they are falsely laying claim
to something which is actually somebody else's. The final syllable of nya-yudbarraj is
unpredictable, and no historical source can be suggested for it.
                                                           Other aspects of word formation 221
9.7. -man, agentive nominal suffixThe suffix -man was found ir two derived forms of agentive meaning: from the verb
particle gerrng-ma 'cry, weep', in yi-gerrngmarnan 'crybaby, one who cries a lot'; and
from the the finite verb ledbarna- 'look at', in yi-ledbarnan One who looks a lot, voyeur'.
  The final segment may be icentified as the absolutive nominal ending (see 3.4.), and
the sequence -rna- may be historically identified with that found in a small number of
finite verbs. This identificat on is quite certain, on the basis that, as noted above,
yi-ledbarnan is directly derived from the finite verb ledbarna- 'look at', and thus only
indirectly linked to the related verb particle led-ba 'look at'. Other verbs with the final
syllable -rna- arejomarna- 'fiiish off', and wojbarna- 'listen' (see 8.1.),
9.8. -widi ~ -bidi, nomin al-forming suffixA rare nominal-forming suflix is attested in two forms: yarrbaly-widi 'nuisance,
nuisance-maker', from the part icle yarrbaly; and jangang-bidl from the panicle jangang.
The meaning of the second requires some explanation.
 There are in Wardaman two particles which people gloss in Kriol as ""hard work la"",
but this has little to do with ""work"" in the Standard English sense. It has to do with the
notion of expending great eff art to try to tell someone something, to make someone
understand or ""listen"". One of these particles is jarnbab (which usually occurs with
yana-\ the other jangang (which also occurs with yana-). Thus it may be said:(526) jangang           ngarr-ge-yi-rri-ya                     wurrugu
       'work'           1INPL-AUX-RR-PST-NAR                   3NSG-DAT
       'We really tried hard with them' [i.e., to tell them something, or convince them
        of something].
  (Note that the AUX ga- is g?- before the reflexive-reciprocal marker.)
  The derived nominal jangang-bidi is used to mean someone who has been the object
of this hard work. Thus speakers gloss jangang-bidi as 'he can't believe', i.e., someone
upon whom one has had no effect, who is incapable of ""listening"" or ""being sorry"" (i.e.,
taking account of one's social effort with him or her).
  Efforts to test this suffix v/ith other particles were met with judgments of non-
acceptability, so it appears to te synchronically rather unproductive.
9.9. -ngana, nominal-forming suffixA rare suffix -ngana has been f aund with particle badbad 'cover' to form badbad-ngana
'blanket', and with reduplicative form durdurrb (from durrb 'stab, jab') to form
dardurrb-ngana 'doctor' (i.e., one who gives injections).
                             Chapter 10
                Issues in constituency and word order
10.1. The question of fn:e word orderAs modern description of Ausfalian languages intensified from the early 1970s, it was
commonly said that they exhibited ""free"" word order, both at the level of the phrase and
the clause (Dixon 1972; Sharpe 1972; see also more recently Simpson 1991, Chapter 2,
where ""free word order"" is desc ibed as a defining dimension of ""non-configurationality""
for the Pama-Nyungan language, Warlpiri). The general claim is that constituent word-
level units can be found in almost any order and the phrase or clause still be grammatically
acceptable. Taken in that baiic sense, Wardaman, too, exhibits greater freedom of
ordering than does English, for example.
  Some researchers, however, have reported of their languages that not all orders are
equally common within the pirase or clause (Heath 1984; Merlan 1988; McGregor
 1990). They have observed tha: ordering is freer than in English and many of the world's
better-known languages, but ha /e sought to open the question, Free with respect to what?
In other words, they have begun to explore the question whether the grammatical notion
of the ""clause"" is the appropriate basis in terms of which to describe ordering phenomena.
In my opinion, the answer wh ch is beginning to emerge from this work is that other
levels of analysis—for example, intersections between constituent structure possibilities
and their typical prosodically organized syntagmatic realizations — must be the units
against which different word-level orderings, and their differing frequency and
meaningfulness, need to be defined.
  We can illustrate from Wardaman examples the difficulties which arise in attempting
to define any particular noun phrase on the basis of constituent structure only, in order
to show how these problems have informed the approach taken further on in this chapter.
Many of the issues involved have been previously noted for their general descriptive
interest. Consider the first few lines of the text (appended) Jalijbang, about a moon
dreaming place on Innesvale Siation.
  A protagonist, of Yiwalyarri iubsection, is identified. Then:(527) yanggi bogogo gangma.i yorri
       'He went hunting and sheared a kangaroo'
        mangali
       'a female'
        wurre-warang
       'with young/a joey'.
 Then the information given to that point is summarized:
224 Chapter 10
(528) yorri nana gangman wiirre-warang
        'He speared the kangaroo with a joey'.
   Obviously, in the text as given, line divisions have already been made which appear to
 be of some significance. These, as will be described, are tone groups. At first,
 information is being conveyed in a manner that may be called ""expansion"": only a small
 ""bit"" is given in each apparent unit. Then a structurally more elaborate summation is
 given, that is, one in which the word-level units can evidently be assumed to comprise a
 whole unit (in this case, clause) in a way the preceding shorter units cannot. That clause
 contains a nominal constituent structure which is not uncommon in Wardaman,
 consisting of a demonstrative determiner, plus nominal plus a nominal modifier of the
 ""having X"" kind described in 5.3. In fact, as we will see, phrases consisting of the first
 two elements — demonstrative plus open-class nominal — are the commonest kind of
two-word noun phrase in Wardaman, and the position of the ""having"" modifier following
the entity is also typical (although such ""having"" constructions may of course occur by
themselves, as the sole word of a noun phrase). The more elaborate phrase shows us a
typical way in which the NP may be realized by a syntagm of words. The preceding
lines, however, cannot be identified as a single NP. One of the main reasons for that must
be taken to be the fact that preceding words do not all occur within a single unit as defined
by prosodic criteria. Semantically, we see that the descriptions ""female"", and ""having
joey"" further specify the reference of ""kangaroo"", for which here the generic term, rather
than any existing, specifically female term, was originally used. A phrase consisting of
an open-class nominal such as ""kangaroo"", and then followed within the same tone unit
by two additional nominal descriptors, would in fact be unusual. It is best to conclude
that in the preceding lines ""kangaroo"", ""female"", and ""having joey"" do not constitute a
phrase, continuous or discontinuous, but together constitute a typical association of
prosodically distinguished units of information.
   To even begin to assemble the evidence concerning what may, and what may not,
constitute a ""phrase"", we have to have some criteria of identification. One must, as is
ordinarily done, take into account the possible function or role of given words within a
conceivable grammatical constituent structure; but identification as a phrase cannot be
made ONLY on such grammatical bases, concerning the possible assignment of words to
constituent structure. If that were the only criterion, we might be tempted for example
to regardgangnian mangali wurre-warang as a discontinuous noun phrase, and perhaps
also to attempt permutations of these words in relation to the verb ""speared"", in order to
establish possibilities of ordering within the clause as a whole. Any or all of such
attempted permutations, I feel quite confident, would be accepted by informants as
intelligible. In doing that, however, we would lose sight of the fact that a group such as
gangnian ntangali wurre-warang is at least not usual within a single prosodically defined
unit.
  It is common for constituent structure to be defined with respect to attested examples
which show the apparent full range of possibilities of realization. What I am suggesting
here, however, may appear to some to go too far: that is, that what may count as an attested
example of a particular kind must be defined with respect to some apparently significant
                                                        Issues in constituency and word order 225
criteria that belong to other levels of linguistic organization beyond the simply
grammatical. We have noted the common report that, when what is taken as the central
issue is ""grammaticality"", many Australian languages appear to exhibit such freedom in
ordering that the result has often been stated as ""any order is possible"". But that does not
tell us what orderings are morj frequent than others, or distinguish the meaningfulness
of the different orders. And when frequency becomes an issue alongside grammaticality,
then it must also be asked, in what contexts do particular orders occur? Ways must be
found of discriminating different linguistic contexts, and I am simply suggesting that that
cannot be done with respect :o the same phenomenon one is attempting, in the first
instance, to describe — grammatical function within constituency. Rather it must be
done with respect to actual realizations of syntagms which differ meaningfully.
Obviously, like some other Australianists (Heath 1984; McGregor 1990; all of us
following Halliday and others of the Firthian school), I accept that prosodically defined
units appear to be a significant and much under-studied resource for identifying contexts
with respect to which different realizations of constituent structure may be defined.","[236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249]"

compared to the other two categories. Ergative-marked agents are much less common
over all texts than are subjects and objects. There is a tendency for lexically specified
nouns or noun phrases in all functions to occur more frequently before the verbal word
rather than after it. In the long Elsie text, for example, 40 specified objects occur within
tone units before the verbal word, and 31 after it. Objects and ergative-marked agents
show much less difference as between position before and after the verbal word than do
subjects, which show a rather more marked tendency to occur before the verb.
  In the Elsie text, of 17 instances of ergative-marked agent noun or noun phrase, 4
occurred on a tone group set off by themselves. In each of those instances the noun or
noun phrase follows the tone unit containing the verb which carries its pronominal
reference. In one case of an ergative agent so set off, it follows a tone unit with
ergative-marked noun, and gives a different description of the referent (i.e., in the first
unit the ergative marked noun is nntlwru-yi Old woman', the one set off by itself,
barnagbarnang-nyi 'auntie', an alternative description).
  Of the 17 instances of ergative marking, in only two tone units are both agent and object
lexically specified In one case the order is VOA (bujnrri walanja nuilurru-yi Old
woman dug the goanna', where both goanna and the old woman have been previously
mentioned and are clearly recoverable). In the second, the order is OVA (a nawurla
wu-di-rri-ya-wuya nnilitrru-wuya-yi ' Oh! the two old women have brought nawurla').
In every instance, the ergative-marked noun or noun phrase is human. There are 7
occurrences oinuilurm ornnilurni-wnya' old woman' or' two old women'; 5 oimeniden
'white man'; 3 of kin terms; 1 of mar lug a ' old man'; and 1 of a personal name.
  In the Galapin text, there are 9 ergative-marked instances. In only two of these are both
agent and object present. One of these is an unusual case of verbal ellipsis (see 10.13.);
but the order of noun phrases is A O. In the second, the order is AVO.

""father"" or ""my father""; 2 of personal names; 1 ofmarluga Old man'; 1 ofyibiyan 'man,
Aborigines'; and 1 oflinin 'snake'.
  In the Onion text there are 5 ergative-marked instances. In two of these both agent and
object present, and the orders are AVO and OVA. The ergative nouns include 2 instances
of a personal name, 2 of ""horse"", and 1 of the dual marked nan-guya-yi 'those two, the
two of them', in reference to two girls.
  In the Mejem text there are 23 ergative marked instances, of which 10 are memden
'white man, white people'; 4 are marluga Old man'; 2 are kin terms; 1 is wuja 'fire'; 1
is mulurru Old woman'; 1 is a personal name; 1 is the Proximate demonstrative clearly
referring to an Aboriginal man; 1 is the indefinite yiwarna-mulu-yi referring to 'some
(men)'; 1 is ngawurnen 'many' referring to many people; 1 is nan.ganung-nyi 'these',
referring to people previously named, cited in absolutive case form.
  In Mejern, there were 4 instances of ergative-marked agents set off on tone units of
their own, with no V. There were 7 instances in which the direct object was lexically
specified within the same tone unit, allowing as one of these mernde-yi ngan-linyje-rri
yi-jili 'the white man cut my hair'. Here, the object marked by pronominal prefix on the
verb is 1SG, the nominal object is yi-jili 'hair'. Three of the other cases involved lexical
specification of the object of the ditransitive ""give"" construction, e.g., mernde-yi 0-wo-
ndi mulurru-wuya 'the whites gave [it] to the two old women'. Of the 7 with object
lexically specified in the same tone unit, orders were as follows: AVO = 3, OVA = 3,
VOA=1.
  In the remaining 12 cases of 23, ergative-marked agent occurred before the verb in 7,
and V before A in 4. There was one in which an ergative-marked agent was flanked by
two verbs within the tone unit and was clearly the agent of both: wunggunbu-lawu-rri
mernde-yi \vunggun-bu-ndi 'the whites caught up to them and shot them'. (There were
also other cases of tone units comprising more than one clause, e.g., /[nyanga-ndi yurrba]
[nungguru new me-ndi mernde- yi]l 'he, came and stood and the white manj grabbed hisi
hand'. This was counted above as an instance of OVA).
  There is some indication in this material of a tendency for realized agent and object to
be distributed on either side of the verbal word or words. The minor ordering VOA which
brings them together most frequently seems to be associated with textual sequences in
which the verb, normally the ""comment"" on a theme, is being treated as point of departure
for the tone unit as a whole. Of 24 texts searched (long and short), 3 had no ergative-
marked nouns or noun phrase at all.","[272, 273]"

   Heath (1976).

3.     Singular-nonsingular subject neutralization. In the combination 3SG            »2SG,
       the semantically singular subject is formally marked as nonsingular, and the
       difference between this form and that with 3NSG subject category neutralized.
  We may now reconsider the distribution of the morpheme gu. As was pointed out in
some speculative historical discussion of gu above, (and now putting aside the suggestion
of its historical, phonologically-conditioned complementarity with ri), the correlation
between gu and nonsingular object marking is not perfect. One case of that lack of
correlation has been otherwise accounted for formally, by the observation concerning 2
object neutralization, above. The only other forms where gu might be expected because
the object is nonsingular, but is not found, are the 3NSG object forms with first or second
person subjects. But we have also observed that all such forms are ""direct"" rather than
""inverse"", and morphologically quite transparent. Considering its absence from direct
combinations regular, we may formulate a statement of the distribution of gu:
4.     Occurrence of gu. In transitive combinations in which the semantic object is
       nonsingular, gu occurs between subject and object person markers, ordered in
       terms of the ranked categories stated above. Distribution of gu is subject to the
       limitation that it does not apply to the combination which has been described as
       exhibiting 2 object neutralization, nor to the direct combinations of third NSG
       objects with first or second person subjects.
  This last pair of restrictions amounts to the observation that gu only occurs in inverse
combinations. A different way of putting this in terms of ordering is that, with the
exception of the form which shows 2 object neutralization, and those with 3SG subject
in which ordering is indeterminate because the subject category is formally zero, gu
occurs in all nonsingular object forms in which the object precedes the subject. The only
exceptions to this, in terms of the occurring ordering, can be the 3NSG object forms with
first and second person subjects.
  Now let us consider the distribution of object-marking n. One simple assumption
would be that n occurs after all object markers, including object number markers,
regardless of their ordering. The only exceptions here would be 3SG object forms, which
are morphological zero, and the 1SG             »2SG forms with the object marked by ng.
This is in fact the assumption which underlies certain morpheme segmentations shown
in Table 8, that require special mention.
  The assumption has been made that the 2             »1SG forms contain accusative marker
n, by analogy with 2           »1NSG forms, and that degemination reduces this underlying
cluster (see 3.3.). Alternatively, one might assume that no n occurs in these forms, so
that, for example, the underlying 2SG              »1EX NSG string would be /yi-n-gu-ni/,
and that no n occurs to the right of gu, where it results in a cluster n-n. Each way of
viewing the matter has its advantages: the statement of the distribution of n is simplified
by the assumption that it occurs to the right of all object markers. On the other hand, if
we view it as not underlying in those combinations mentioned above, there is no need to
posit underlying geminate clusters n-n.
132 Chapter 6   The simple statement of the distribution of n as following all object markers requires
equating some occurrences of ng (before velar stop) with the accusative marker, in a way
that is not entirely unproblematic. Considerations are as follows.
   With first or second person subject, 3NSG object is marked by wu- and accusative
marker n. In the 3           »3NSG combinations, though, the first element of the prefix
complex has been segmented as wu-ng, where the historical identity of this ng with the
accusative marker n is plausible but not certain. The basic 3NSG object form (with 3
subject) is wunggun-, in which gu is a nonsingular number element, and n the accusative
marker.
   In wunggun-, any claim that ng represents an assimilated instance of the accusative
marker is problematic, but cannot be rejected out of hand, based on the following
consideration. There are several other places in the prefix forms where an apparently
comparable ng occurs before nonsingular element gu, including 2NSG                »1EX NSG
yunggunu-, 3SG              »2NSG nunggun-, and 3NSG                >2NSG nunggunburr-.
There are numerous other instances, such as 3SG            »1EX NSG yin.gun- where what
is evidently the accusative marker n does not assimilate before the velar stop of the
nonsingular element gu. However, there is another place in the paradigm in which what
is evidently to be identified as the accusative marker undergoes assimilation, in
3SG           »2SG and 3NSG             >2SG forms (both) yimburr- (2SG yi-, accusative
marker n, and 3NSG subject element wu-rr). Thus assimilation of the accusative marker
elsewhere renders its assimilation before the velar stop plausible, but not to be
unproblematically assumed.
  The simplest statement of the distribution of n, with note taken of the fact that it requires
some speculative assumptions as above, would be:
5.     In all transitive combinations with overtly marked objects, with the exception of
        1SG         >2SG, the object marker n is inserted after the object pronominal. If
       the object is gu marked, n is inserted immediately after gu as well as to the right of
       the object pronominal which precedes it.
  Thus the assumption is made that some occurring prefixal forms are to be accounted
for by the historical double occurrence of n, now frozen in the prefixal forms. The
principles stated can also be understood generatively, as a way of producing the output
of actually occurring prefixal forms. They need to be ordered with respect to each other
so that the ordering of pronominal elements precedes the distribution of gu. An example
of the way in which the principles form the basis of a derivation is shown below with the
transitive combination 3NSG             »1EX NSG. We assume ordering is the first rule to
apply to the categorial combination:
                          Input                              Output     Ordering          3NSG         »1EXNSG               yi-wu-rr-

                                         Independent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 133  Accusative marker n, used throughout the system (except in the case of 3SG objects),
serves as an index of grammatical function, while the pronominal ordering constraint
serves as an index of hierarchical feature relations between the members of any subject-
object pair.
  The pronominal prefix system relies overwhelmingly on relational marking to
distinguish subject and object function, rather than on morphological differentiation of
person marking itself by function. The striking exception to this is the occurrence of a
2SG allomorph -ni- with first person objects. As will now become evident, that marker
belongs to the system of person marking linked with irrealis mood. In just that familiar
area of the transitive paradigm (1       >2 and 2        > 1 combinations) in which formal
representation can be seen to be contested within linguistic systems (see Heath
1976: 188), paradigmatic material is brought over from the marked irrealis mood
category. Differences of the irrealis paradigm from the indicative in person- and other
related prefixal marking will now be summarized.","[154, 155, 156, 157]"

some may not appear so. Let us outline the morphemes that represent the various person
categories.
  Third person singular subject and object are everywhere zero. By comparison with
third person NSG object -wu- which always follows first and second person subject
marker (e.g., 1SG           >3NSG) one may, in attempting to simplify an eventual
statement of the significance of relative ordering, assume that 3SG object always follows
first and second person categories also.
  3NSG object is wu- in combinations where the subject is first or second person. These
combinations always show the ordering S-O (subject-object). In combinations where
object is 3NSG and subject a third person, we find that what may be identified as an
object marker wu- appears first in the prefix complex, followed by a nonsingular object
marker gu (see further), and then subject marker for the third person category, e.g.,
3NSG           »3NSG /wu-n-gu-n-wu-rr/. Therefore in these combinations 3NSG object
is (partly) expressed by -wu-, as in combinations with first and second person subjects,
but order is inverted to O-S.
  First person singular subject is always nga-. First person singular object is everywhere
represented by nga- followed by an accusative marker n and then subject pronominal.
128 Chapter 6First person singular is always first in the prefix complex, as subject or object; and a
glance at the tables shows that all first person categories are ordered first, regardless of
whether they are subject or object.
   1 EXNSG is always represented by person marker yi- both as subject and object, and
in forms with 1 EXNSG acting on third person object, this is always followed by
nonsingular marker -rr-.
   1INDU is always represented by ngayi-, as subject and object.
   1INPL is always marked by person marker nga- as subject or object, together with
nonsingular -rr- as subject with third person object.
  2SG subject is represented by yi- with third person objects, by -m- with first person
objects. It appears first in the prefix complex as subject with third person objects (S-O),
but follows first person in 2SG subject on first person forms (O-S). 2SG object is marked
by -ng- with first person subject, and here the order is S-O; by nu- (basically a 2NSG
form) when the subject is 1 EXNSG, and here the order is S-O; and by yi- person marker
with third person subjects, and here the order is O-S.
  2NSG is always represented by person marker nu- as subject or object. It always follows
first person elements whatever its function, and precedes third person markers, regardless
of function.
  3SG subject is always zero; 3NSG subject is always -wu-rr-, and follows all object
markers. A summary of this global allomorphy of person and number markers is:      1SG             nga-                     S or Ο

  Besides the person markers, two other elements in the prefix system function to indicate
subject-object relations. The first of these is accusative marker n. This marker may be
taken to occur twice in many forms, following the object person marker, and following
the element gu where this is present (see discussion of this assumption below). The
accusative marker occurs in all 3          »1 forms, all 2       >1 forms, all 3        >2
forms, all 1       >2 forms with the exception of 1SG         >2SG, and in all forms with
3NSG object, regardless of subject.
                                         Independent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 129  The elementgu is foundin all plural-object forms except those with 3NSG object where
the subject is first or second person, and in the first person on 2NSG object forms. Thus
gu marks nonsingularity of the object in those forms in which it occurs. Heath (1976)
has suggested comparatively concerning n and gu that these were historically
complementary, with n following vowel-final object prefixes, andgu following prefix
complexes with final nonsingular element rr (or equivalent). If one accepts this, it then
becomes necessary to assume that the accusative marker spread so that it also followed
gu. The distribution of n is now wide, and it is no longer limited, as it may historically
have been, to marking object chiefly in combinations with singular object, which would
have largely been correlated with vowel-final prefix combinations.
  However, Wardaman poses three problems of different kinds and seriousness for these
historical assumptions about the original complementary distribution of n and gu as
phonologically-conditioned markers of singular and nonsingular objects, respectively.
The first problem concerns forms with 1DU IN object which would not have contained
nonsingular morpheme rr, but yet, as objects, are followed by gu. The second concerns
3NSG object forms which do not havegi* where the subject is a first or second person
category. Here however we must assume that 3NSG as object with first and second
subject categories never exhibited the nonsingular marker rr, which is associated with
subject forms; thus its forms as subject would have been wu-rr, but its form as object
with those categories, wu.
  The third problem has to do with the absence of gu in the forms with first person subject
on 2NSG object. The subject marker for this category is nu\ thus we may assume that
there has been no nonsingular rr marker in this category (but note that the Absolutive
2NSG free pronoun is niirrug). In the 1           >2 forms at issue, 2NSG is followed only
by accusative n as we would expect if this were a vowel-final category. On the other
hand, 2NSG object forms with third subject show the element g», and in the terms of the
proposed historical distribution of n and n we would expect thisgz< to have followed rr,
but there is no reason to posit its historical presence in the form.
  Alternatively it might be suggested, in the case of the 1DU and the 2NSG object forms
mentioned, that the function as gu as nonsingular object marker allowed it to be
generalized to 1DUIN object forms and 2NSG forms with third subject, but not to
1         >2NSG forms where a different process, plural object neutralization (see below)
has shaped the structure of the 1         > 2 categories.
  A genera] characteristic of the Wardaman prefix system is, in sum, that case relations
are made explicit not by different shapes of person markers covarying with fwcuonper
se, but chiefly by the presence of the relational marker n, along with the contrast between
nonsingular subject element r r versus object element gu.
  Another feature of the system is that, excepting the UN forms, there is one
morphologically singular and one nonsingular category in each person (as in the free
pronouns). That is, there is no dual-plural distinction except in UN.
  There are regularities in the ordering of pronominal elements, but these relate, not
simply to respective subject and object function of the two adjuncts, but to the feature
specification of the two in relation to each other. There are approximately equal numbers
of forms in which the order is OS and S-O. The kinds of combinations exhibiting each
130 Chapter 6order differ, however. The S-O combinations include all 1                >2, 1         >3, and
2        >3. The O-S combinations include all the opposite relationships, 2                 »1,
3        »1, and 3        »2. Combinations with third person subject and/or object are
indeterminate, since both categories are always zero. In the combinations with 3NSG
object, the 3NSG          »3NSG forms plainly shows O-S order.
  The facts of ordering allow us to rank three categories below, and other considerations
of formal patterning (the presence of gu in e.g., 3SG           >3NSG, for example) lead us
to add the fourth, 3SG category, despite the fact that it is always formally zero, as follows:                                   I
                                   II
                                   III NSG
                                   IIISG
                             v
   Arrows indicate the determination of ordering. That is, the descending arrow is meant
to indicate that the subject is a ""higher"" category and the object a ""lower"" one; these are
the combinations with S-O ordering. The ascending arrow represents combinations
where subject is a lower category and object a higher one. These are the O-S
combinations. An ordering principle may be stated in relation to these categories:
1.     In any subject-object combination where order is identifiable, a pronominal of a
       higher category will appear before a pronominal of a lower one, no matter what the
       case function of the two.
   This means, for example, that a first person pronominal element will appear before any
other, no matter whether it is marking subject or object function.
   We may refer to the S-O combinations as ""direct"", and the O-S ones as ""inverse"".8 This
distinction will be useful in providing a way of describing the distribution of gu. Before
that can be summarized, however, we need to formulate two instances of neutralization
of pronominal number.
  From the set of occurring forms, it can be seen that 1EX NSG             >2SG and 1EX
NSG           »2NSG are identical: yi-nu-n-. The difference in object number has been
neutralized, and the occurring 2 morph -nu- is that elsewhere associated with nonsingular
number:
2.     Object neutralization. In 1EXNSG            >2 forms, the formal number distinction
       between 2SG and 2NSG object is neutralized, and the semantically singular object
       is marked with nonsingular form.
   A second number neutralization can be seen in the fact that there is no difference
between 3NSG             »2SG and 3SG           >2SG; both are yimburr-. The distinction
found elsewhere between 3SG and 3NSG subject is neutralized in the second form, with
semantically singular subject marked by nonsingular /wu-rr/.","[150, 151, 152, 153, 154]"
"
10.4. The possessive noim phrase
A possessor noun or noun phrase may indicate possession in one of two main ways, or
sometimes, in a way that combines both possibilities.
  The pronominal possessor nay be marked solely by a member of the series of
independent genitive pronouns (6.5.):(568)   nganinggin       ngabobu            0-digirrijba-rri     na
        mine-ABS         FM-AIJS            3SG-die-PST          [now]
        'My father's mother has died now'.
 Alternatively, the pronominal possessor is often found to be marked by a form of the
Dative independent pronoun series (6.3.). Thus, in the following example, where we
might have nganinggin yi-jeyeman 'my promised spouse', there occurs:(569)   (nganburr-wo-ndi)         yi-jeyeman          nganu
        3NSG/lSG-give-PST         YI-promise          1SG-DAT
        'They gave me to my promised husband'.
  While it is usual for the dative pronoun to follow the possessed noun, examples of the
following kind are also found:(570)   guda               nganu            yiguyu
        where              1SG-DAT          mother-ABS
        'Where is my mother?
  Not infrequently, independent genitive possessor and independent dative are found
flanking the possessed nomiml:(571)   nganinggin       yi-jeyeman            nganu
        1SG-ABS          YI-promise-ABS        ISO-DAT
        '[They gave me to] mj promised husband'.
  The order as shown, with independent genitive pronoun to the left, and dative to the
right of the modified, is usual; but a few examples of dative to the left and genitive to the
right have been found. A cons luction of this sort may occur without an entity nominal,
in cases in which it has presumably been ellipsed:(572)   nganinggin       nganu               nganburr-wo-ndi
        mine-ABS         ISG-ΕΆΤ             3NSG/lSG-give-PST
        'They gave me mine' [or, possibly, 'to mine'].
236 Chapter 10  While genitive pronoun may occur as sole word above standing for the ellipsed
nominal, it would not produce an acceptable sentence for the dative pronoun to occur
alone. Thus, in such doubled constructions (gungan.gin gunga 'his' etc.), the dative
pronoun is evidently syntactically dependent upon the genitive one.
  Where the possessor is nominal, it is usual if not universal for possession to be marked
both on the nominal possessor by suffixation of dative case, and further within the phrase
by the appropriate form of the dative independent pronoun (as illustrated in 5.2.3.). Thus,
for example:(573) jarrug            go                 galawarra-wu
      egg-ABS           3SG-DAT            spinifex pigeon-DAT
        'Eggs of the spinifex pigeon'.(574) giminy-gu              go            yibiwi
      [name]-DAT             3SG-DAT       father-ABS
        'Gimiyn's father'.(575)   mulurru-wuya-wu          yiguyu             wurrugu-wuya
        old woman-DU-DAT         mother-ABS         3NSGDAT-DU
        'The mother of the two old women'.
  As the above two examples illustrate (see also 5.2.3.), the possessor nominal may occur
either before or after the head noun. Further, the position of the dative pronoun is not
strictly fixed: it may occur following the possessed head noun, or following the dative-
marked possessor noun. Because of its ordering freedom, it may sometimes occur at some
remove from the dative-marked possessor noun with which it agrees:(576) yurnvarla-wu        yimbanay         yi-ngawuyu         go
      [ss]-DAT            [ssJ-ABS         YI-wife-ABS        3SG-DAT
        'Yurrwarla's wife is yimbanay' [i.e., for a male of yurrwarla subsection, the
         appropriate wife category is yimbanay].
  In 5.2.3. it was shown that the possessor of a possessor is also dative-marked (e.g.,
my-DAT mother's-DAT dog), and that particularly the nominal dative-marked possessor
tends to show agreement with a dative independent pronoun as well; also, that a
dative-marked possessor cannot be further inflected for case function within the clause.
Such further case function can be marked only on the possessed head of the nominal
phrase: ""my-DAT mother's-DAT dog-ERG (bit me)"", and the like.
  A few cases turned up in the corpus of collected texts which seem to suggest that
sometimes, a construction which is apparently semantically possessive can be formed
simply by juxtaposition of the possessed and possessor nominals, viz.:(577) nana              buda                  yingilga
      that-ABS          black plum-ABS        juice-ABS
        'The juice of the black plum'.
                                                         Issues in constituency and word order 237
  In considering certain similai constructions in Gooniyandi, McGregor (1990:253) has
suggested that they may be reg;irded not as possessive phrases, but as classifying ones, in
which the head noun is classified by type (in the above example, ""juice"" as of the specific
type ""plum juice""). It is attractive to consider such phrases as of some kind other than
possessive, because they differ from the usual possessive construction types. However,
several comments need to be made about this proposal for Wardaman. First of all, the purely
syntactic process of juxtaposition seems not to be highly productive: such examples as the
above stand out in the corpus as exceptions. There are however a few instances in which kin
relations, normally expressed by the usual kinds of possessive constructions, are simply
indicated by juxtaposition of the possessor to the kin term. Compare, for example, in the text
Gawalyan lines (50) and (55). The first is the expected kind of nominal possessive
construction: mulurru-wu bailet-gu yiguyu go Old woman Violet's mother', with third
person dative independent prc noun agreeing with the possessor (see next section for
discussion of phrases such as ""old woman X""). But in line (55) we find simply: dorij
bauet yiguyu wurruguya 'Dois and Violet's mother' with third person nonsingular
independent dative pronoun, and no dative marking on the possessor nominals, the two
personal names. Since this is not very common, it is probably best considered not a regular
kind of possessive construction, but an instance where the two personal names of those
readily understood to be the possessors are simply apposed to the possessed noun.
  Second, there are some fairly regular types of juxtaposition of what might be described
as generic and specific terms. Some of these seem to show a quite regular, even strict,
ordering, while others do not. These will be at least mentioned, if not analyzed, in 10.5.
  Finally, mention must be made of the typical syntactic treatment of body parts. Body
parts may function as arguments in all of the usual clause types, and may be marked by
pronominal prefix on the verb in their own right. For example, in a text about a fight
which developed between emu and brolga, there lies an explanation of why each of those
birds has its particular characteristics. Brolga savagely clobbered emu's two hands, so
that they are now small wings, and emu is flightless. One line says:(578) nungguru-wan         yanja                go              wudu        wudu       na_
      hand-ABS-DF          3-3SG-go-PRES        3SGDAT          little      little     [now]
        'And her hands [wings are very small now'.
  In (578), nunggum is the intransitive subject of the verb ""go"", which means in context
""become"" or ""have become"". Further on, emu retaliates, and meaning is expressed in
such a way that the body part she strikes is treated as direct object, and even more fully
concretized by addition of the uticle suffix:(579) gabarri            gumurtinji-yi      0-bu-ndi-ya               yi-bam-bi
      again              emu-ERG            3SG-hit-PST-NAR           YI-head ABS-ART
       'And then emu hit her head'.       nana              yi-bam             yanja               go      yi-belyangman
       that-ABS          YI-heai-ABS        3SG-go-PRES         3SG-DAT YI-red-ABS
       'And her head is red'.
238 Chapter 10  There is no overt expression of possession here, and with the salience of body parts in
the narrative it is quite possible for them to function in their own right as intransitive
subjects of the verb ""go"", here meaning ""to be characteristically"".
  It is perhaps more usual, however, for body parts to function syntactically in a way that
links them more directly with their owners.
  Consider a common circumstance in which a body part is the direct object of an action.
The third person object is not cross-referenced on the verb; it is realized by an
independent absolutive noun. The possessor is indicated on the verb, in the sort of
construction illustrated in (580):(580) ngan-linyje-rri             yi-jili
      3SG-cut-PST                 YI-hair-ABS
       'He cut my hair' ['he cut me hair'].
  In such an instance the ""hair"" is in the same role as its possessor, and I will regard such
cases as ones of possessive NP with pronominal possessor and nominal possessed, with
the possibility of realisation on the verb of the former only.
  There are certain characteristic expressions, largely of mental action or disposition, in
which a body part is the indispensable adjunct in the creation of the particular meaning:(581) yi-gulan           nga-we-ndi
      YI-ear-ABS         ISG-fall-PST
       Ί forgot'.
  These are not possessive constructions of the same kind as ""my hair"" (580), for
absolutive yi-gulan 'ear' is idiomatically combined as adjunct with the verb we- to create
the meaning 'forget'. Similarly:(582) mejern              ya-wud-jingi-n             lud-ba
      stomach-ABS         3-3NSG-be/sit-PRES         happy
       'They are happy'.
  Absolutive mejern 'belly, stomach' as adjunct of the particle plus AUX construction
ludba and jingi yields the meaning 'be happy'. Again, this is not a possessive
construction.
  There are instances of possession where a possessed body part is not in a major syntactic
function and thus cannot be marked on the verb, for example, in an intransitive
construction such as:(583) 0-we-ndi             (nganu)          nganinggin-ya        yi-bam-nya
      3SG-fall-PST         (3SG-DAT)        1SGGEN-LOC           YI-head-LOC
       'It fell [on me] on my head'.
  Here the possessive phrase consists minimally of pronominal possessor marked by
independent genitive pronoun and possessed nominal.

10.5. Generic-specific noun phrasesIt is very common in Wardamaa for people to be referred to in terms of membership of
a gender/age category. The mail commonly used gender/age-set terms are niarluga ' old
man' and nmlurru Old woman'. These, then, are generic terms which identify by the
gender/age- s et to which someone belongs, and individuals may be more closely
identified by juxtaposition of a personal name. The overwhelmingly common order is:
age-set term followed by perso lal name. Thus:(584) niarluga berru
       Old man Berru'.(585) nnihirru yidawim
      ' Old woman Yidawun'.
  Persons may also be specified by subsection term. Usually, the subsection term occurs
as sole lexeme of a phrase, aid thus there is no internal syntax. However, textual
examples have been found which show that when part of a more elaborate identifying
phrase, subsection terms occur between age-set term and personal name, thus:(586) niarluga yurrwarla dulu
      ' Old man Dulu of yumvarla subsection'.
 Persons may also be specified by gender/age-set term followed by a kin term, usually
one designating someone as kinsman from the speaker's perspective, thus:(587) niarluga gagung
      Old man grandfather' | father's father].
  It might be suggested that ir the above cases, we are dealing with constructions of
generic and specific terms, in Jiat order: the age-set (and subsection) terms designate
most generally, the personal names and kin terms specifically.
  Though it would not seem tha: there is a highly generalized Generic + Specific sy ntagm
operating widely over the nominal domain, certain other typical constructions may be
noted It is reasonably comiron for certain kinds of animals to be designated by a
construction which includes ths generic lexeme lay in 'meat, animal'. It would appear
that either Generic-Specific or Specific-Generic order may occur, e.g., either gaiignian
layin or layin gangnian 'kangaroo'. A textual example occurs in which the speaker is
describing the kinds of things she and others used to eat when young, as opposed to
European foods:(588) jarrug          go           nan-gu          galawarra-wu          lany-gu
       egg-ABS        3SG-DAT that-DAT             pigeon-DAT           animal-DAT
      'Eggs of the spinifex pigeon'.
240 Chapter 10  See (653) for a textual example of the order layin gangman. There are examples of the
generic mayin 'vegetable food' occurring with specific terms, with similar freedom or
ordering. And there are scattered other examples of what may or may not be semantically
generic-specific phrases, for example within a single tone group the following:(589) yi-munburra        0-wo-ndi           dangindi
      money-ABS          3SG-give-PST       paperbark-ABS
        'He gave him his money'.
  In context, it was evident that the particular contribution of dangindi, otherwise the
generic term for 'paperbark' and today used also to mean 'paper', was to make clear that
a particular station worker was paid off by being written a cheque, i.e., not money in
general, but paper (dangindi) that, exceptionally, is a kind of money (specifically, of >'/-
type as opposed to generic wumunburra 'money'). Possibly in other contexts
yimunburra dangindi might also be able to refer to 'paper money' (that is, it is likely that
""cheque"" and ""paper money"" might be referred to in the same way, as opposed to generic
wumunburra 'money'). In any case, it is unclear given the semantic contribution of the
noun class prefix yi- that we are dealing with a generic-specific construction of a kind
comparable to any of those discussed above. We may be dealing with a construction in
which yimunburra and dangindi are more or less semantically equivalent within the
linguistic context, where meanings were plainly being made about paying off a worker
with money. The above remarks on generic-specific and possibly related constructions
are obviously illustrative and suggestive rather than analytic.","[259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264]"

My thorough-going obligation to Wardaman people of Katherine, Northern Territory, as
well as my debt to some researchers who studied languages of this area before me, is
described in 1.5 of the following grammar. Here I would like to acknowledge support
for the funding of my research, and my gratitude to fellow researchers.
  My first period of research in Katherine, from 1976 to 1979, during which I did
considerable work with Wardaman people, was funded by the Australian Institute of
Aboriginal Studies, now the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander
Studies, Canberra. I am particularly grateful to Warwick Dix for having overseen many
aspects of field support.
  In 1988 and 1989,1 was invited by Josephine Flood, then at the Australian Heritage
Commission, to take part in interdisciplinary research on Aboriginal sites of Willeroo,
Delamere and Innesvale Stations. Permission to visit those properties became easier to
obtain in the late 1980s than it had been before. As a result, I was able to expand my
familiarity with Wardaman country considerably. I was able to visit not only rock art
sites (the focus of research by archaeologists) but also many other Wardaman sites of
significance which I had been learning about for some years from Wardaman people.
  For discussion of Australian languages and many other matters over the years, I would
like to especially acknowledge Paul Black, Jeffrey Heath, Pat McConvell, David Nash,
and Alan Rumsey. I am indebted to Georg Bossong for his useful editorial suggestions
on an earlier draft of this manuscript, especially for his comments on analysis of the
pronominal categories (Chaptero), and his encouragement to expand the analysis of word
order (Chapter 10). Lorraine Garland, Mark Harvey, Stephen Roberts, and Karen
Westmacott were invaluable assistants in the preparation of this manuscript. My thanks
also to the Cartography section of the Department of Geography at the University of
Sydney for preparation of maps.

                                     Introduction
1.1. Wardaman today: The language and its speakers Wardaman is a non-Pama Nyungan language of the upper, inland Northern Territory of
Australia. It is now one of the most widely spoken Aboriginal languages of Katherine, a
rapidly-growing1 town of about 8000 people located on the Stuart Highway in the upper
third of the Northern Territory (Map 1). Though Wardaman is more widely known than
some of the other languages of the general Katherine area, the number of active speakers
is relatively small. I estimate there are 30 people aged 40 and above who live in and
around Katherine, and regularly speak Wardaman in some of their interactions with each
other. They do not speak only Wardaman to each other and to other Aboriginal people
with whom they live, but also use north Australian Kriol (see Sandefur 1979) and other
Aboriginal languages.
  Additionally, there is a much larger number of people — possibly numbering as many
as two hundred — with and around whom those active speakers live, and in many cases,
have lived for a long period of time, who understand Wardaman and consider hearing it
spoken around them a regular feature of their lives. Many of these additional people are
close family of the ""core"" speakers, children, grandchildren, and others. Some others,
however, tend to be more distantly related ""countrymen"" of the Wardaman — people
who identify with tribal groupings of Victoria and Daly Rivers and the larger region west
and south of Katherine, contiguous with what the Wardaman regard as their traditional
territory. These countrymen include people who are identified as Jaminjung, Yangman
and Mudbura, among other tribal groupings. Many of these people have been in the
Katherine area for a long time, and some are married to Wardaman. Additional
countrymen from the Victoria River hinterland, who identify with tribal groupings
including Ngarinyman, Nungali and Ngaliwurru, often visit the Katherine camps and
houses where Wardaman people live when they come in to town. (See Map 2 showing
approximate territorial association of the tribal groupings mentioned). Some of the older
countrymen not only understand Wardaman, but can speak it, even if they do not do so
as often as the Wardaman core speakers.
  Younger Wardaman people — in my observation, including at least everyone born after
the Second World War — do not speak the language actively, but use at most the
occasional word and phrase. Varying with family, however, some of these younger
people have a good understanding of the language. Due to the particular circumstances
1. The town had continued to grow steadily but slowly until 1986, when the recommissioning of
a RAAF base east of the town, Tindal. was the impetus for the rapid near-doubling of the town's
population. Under these conditions, and despite considerable Aboriginal movement into the town
in the 1960s. 1970s, and 1980s, there has been diminution of the proportion of the town's people
who are Aborigines.
2 Chapter 1under which many Wardaman have lived for the last few decades (see 1.4.), many
younger people of certain families have had a great deal of influential exposure to
Wardaman, and have a rather full, passive knowledge of the language which apparently
might, under some conditions, be convertible into active speakership.
  Thus active use of Wardaman is more closely associated with age among Victoria River
and allied ""countrymen"" than it is simply with social identification as Wardaman.
Tendency to use the language, however, seems to be strongly correlated both with age
and with recognition of Wardaman as one's ""own"" language (see Sutton 1978).
  Wardaman people now mainly live around and in Katherine town, although some
people who either identify themselves as Wardaman, or consider that identity a major
component of their family background, live on stations and in other places in the Victoria
River region (including Killarney, Kildurk, and Bulla Stations, Wave Hill, and Yarralin).
  Wardaman are concentrated at two camps outside of Katherine, to the south and west,
towards their traditional country. These are Binjara (Bunjarri\ a community on
Manbulloo Station about 12 kms. from Katherine on the Victoria Highway; and The
Rockhole, about 10 kms outside of town on the Fiorina Road (see Map 3). Increasingly,
some Wardaman people occupy houses in the town, and some people move back and
forth between the camps outside of town, and relatives' houses in town, with one or the
other locale being the normal residence and the other a place where they may spend
shorter periods, a day or perhaps a few days at a time. Wardaman is spoken at Binjara,
Rockhole, and in the town at Wardaman-occupied houses and in the course of activity
(e.g., shopping) in town. Given the close proximity of the two major camps, one or
(usually) more vehicles will commute between them and the town, once or (often) more
times per day. Visiting among Wardaman in and around town is very frequent, and a
major daily activity for many.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"  Possibly, given its usual position before the finite verb, the post-verbal position, and
particularly the tone-group final position gives a special prominence to the predicate
meaning expressed by the particle.
  In general, insofar as a determinate semantic relation can be posited between particles
and finite verbs, the former may be said to restrict the latter in that they contribute a
specificity of meaning that the latter does not have by itself. Particles do not regularly
combine with each other to constitute predicate meanings in the way, for example, two
or several verbal roots regularly serialize in some New Guinean languages; examples
with more than two particles within the same finite clause have not been found, and those
of two are not regular, idiomatic combinations. Where two particles occur together, there
seems to be a regular semantic relationship between them of the following two kinds.
First, one of the particles might be described as semantically more specific than the other.
It is one that enters into regular combination with the finite verb in a unique lexical
predicate meaning. The other particle is more general than the first, semantically
compatible with it, and refines or elaborates it semantically. This second particle tends
to be of such generality that, along a notional spectrum of predicate modification such
as was mentioned in Chapter 4, it might fall into the category of adverb.
  In the second sort of case, there again exists a relation of semantic compatibility,
perhaps even partial synonymy, between the two particles, which need not be contiguous
within the clause, and together they reinforce a particular predicate meaning, or express
a conjunction of partly similar, paired meanings. The relation of specificity and
generality typical of the first sort of case is not found here; instead, the two particles
appear to be of approximately equal lexical specificity. Examples of these sorts of
combinations follow.(614) nan-guya            nganburr-ga-ndi-ya-marla                         buda-wu

         black plum, when the rains tailed off finally
         the two of them took me foraging and camping out for black plum'.
254 Chapter 10
   This example might be seen to illustrate both types of particle cooccurrence
characterized above. First, in the second line there is the combination girdibun-ma which
means 'finish, end' (and as a nominal modifier may mean ""all, the whole lot"") together
with the particle plus verb combination yarr-ma ya- 'to diminish, tail off, end', often used
of seasonal rains. The former particle is more general than the first in that it expresses
completion more broadly, and restricts the following lexical combination, producing a
meaning something like ""when it ended completely, altogether"". In the last line is the
combination bogogo ngurlmud, of the second sort, where one particle cannot be seen as
restricting or modifying the other, because they are of approximately equal lexical
specificity, semantically compatible in that each designates activities defined in
opposition to staying put, being in camp and the like. The result is a more conjunctive
kind of expression: ""foraging and camping out"".(615) lurle      wu-lu-rri-ya     ngawurnen                   mulerr-ma

        Ά great number [of them] cried and grieved/cried in mourning'.
  (615) may be considered an instance of the second kind, where there is a relation of
semantic compatibility and partial synonymy between the two particles, lurle used in the
meaning 'cry, weep' and mulerr-ma with connotations of public, loud, grieving and
mourning, particularly for a death. Together the particles encode and reinforce a single
predicate meaning (as opposed to a more clearly conjunctive one of the bogogo ngurlmud
type).(616) nganinggin   yibiwi                   0-lu-rri-ya           nganu    na_

        'My father cried for me now he worried and longed for me'.
  In (616), moyin-ma (which, like some other constructions of sentiment and affect,
occurs with the Absolutive nominal mejern 'stomach', see 10.4.), apparently conveys a
sense of worry or concern, while luyurr-ma designates longing, pining, or sometimes
compassion for. The combination seems to be conjunctive, rather than one particle
restricting the other.(617)   warlarrgu       wud-janga-ndi                werrwerr
        outside         3NSG-come-PST                outwards rdp
        'They came outside'.
  As first briefly mentioned in 7.6.3., in Wardaman as in Wakiman (see Cook 1987:253),
there is a common use of two orientational particles which locate action or state as
""outwards"", ""outside"" and ""inwards, inside"" (but the relational sense, or the relation to
something else, of both terms may sometimes not be very precisely defined or explicitly
indicated). In Wardaman, the most common term that designates 'inside, inwards' is
                                                         Issues in constituency and word order 255
warljub(-a), and this is more adverbial than specifically particle-like, in that it readily
occurs with any number of finite verbs, and is not particularly strongly associated with
any, in anything approximating a regular particle plus finite verb combination. There is,
however, a second particle wululu 'inwards, inside', which while it may combine with
any verb of motion (""come"", ""go"" etc.), tends to occur with special frequency with we-,
which by itself means 'fall'. The combination wululu we-, however, does not mean to
""fall in(side)"", but rather simply 'go inside, motion inwards' wululu ngerr-we-n 'let us
go inside'.
  The particle werr-ma Outwards, outside' is often used to describe the situation of
people emerging from the countryside into a camp or habited place, approximately 'they
came out'; it is used to describe where rivers and creeks come ""out"" or debouche; and to
describe the emergence of dreaming figures from the landscape or from a position covert
within landforms into the visible world, or into a particular place. As in (610), this particle
may occur with other forms such as warlarrgu, generally used (now, at least) to talk about
Outside' a house or other structure as opposed to inside, and of such generality that it
might be designated an adverb as easily as a particle. Although werr is also of
considerable generality (i.e., it is used to describe the ""outward"" motion or position of a
large range of arguments), it is more particle- than adverb-like in that it is regularly found
in lexical-syntactic combination with the finite verb bu- to express action or motion
outwards (although it MAY also occur with other verbs). Thus, the coocurrence of
warlarrgu and werr would seemingly be best described semantically as one of a more
general item modifying a more specific one, and together expressing not just emergence
Outwards' (i.e., the inward to outward trajectory of werr), but to the outside (the general
location designated by warlarrgu).
  The examples presented so far have been of particles cooccurring within a single clause
on a tone unit, where each particle (or adverb) is associated with the finite verb of the
clause, each in the same way, or one apparently modifying or restricting the other. It
often happens in connected narrative that particles are used without a finite verb but
simply with a major argument of a (partly realized) clause, often the object, as in the
following:(618)   wurr-bel-wu-rri-ya             girdibun
        3NSG-slice-PST-NAR             finish        wolon            barlbarlb           wurr-gi-ndi-ya-wuya                      gunga
        grass-ABS

        YI-rock-ABS         heap rdp            grass-ABS       spread rdp
        'They sliced it, that's all (finished)
        the two of them spread the grass out for it
        heap up stones, spread out grass'.
  Especially given the preceding context, the last tone unit can be easily understood
despite the absence of any finite verb. There are many textual examples elsewhere of a
256 Chapter 10tone group consisting of one or two grammatically complete clauses, and then an
""appended"" particle without finite verb, final or near-final within the tone group. The
effect of this kind of ""incomplete"" structure is to indicate that the action, condition etc.
designated by the particle should be interpreted in relation to the rest of the tone group,
and in direct relation to major arguments within it. Insofar as ""ellipsis"" is used to mean
that some constituent formerly present has been zeroed, the term does not seem
appropriate. We seem to be dealing with instances in which the particle SUGGESTS the
fuller verbal expression. The following set of examples should illustrate this common
textual effect:(619) wurr-ga-ndi-ya         nana       magulu          rm                dun    wiya-ya

      'They took the yam now and tipped it into water'.
  A usual combination with particle dun 'tip, pour' is the finite verb wudba-. In (619),
however, there is no finite verb with dun, but the object of the particle is clearly understood
to be the immediately preceding magulu, and the subject, the 3NSG pronominal on the verb.(620)    wurr-me-ndi            jubung
         3NSG-AUX-PST            grind

         3NSG-eat-PST
        'They ground the charcoal and mixed it with water
        mixed it with water and ate it'.
  Here a few lines are given to establish that there has been one instance of ""they ground
it"", with particle jubung and finite verb me-; the object, 'charcoal', is separately specified
and then repeated in the third line, which ends with particle ngay 'mix, stir', and no finite
verb. The following line begins with the finite verb (me- is the usual finite verb with
ngay, while jubung commonly occurs with both bu- and me-), a repetition of ""with
water"", and of the particle itself.(621)   marlarluga                 nurdurd

        wurren
        child-ABS
        '[they put] the old men in a heap
        they heaped them up
        they just shot them and heaped them
        they shot little tiny kids and all'.
  The particle without finite verb occurs in the third line: duyma 'heap' normally occurs
with the finite verb gi-. The following line does not return to more fully specify that
predicate, however, but returns to the theme of shooting and the fact that even little
children were killed.(622)   gud     0-gaju-rri          worroman-bi         wardabarrb
        arise   3SG-AUX-PST         quickly-ART         leap/start        gayardung       0-yanggi   yirrgulun                     judjud
        run             3SG-AUXPST river-ABS                     descend
        'He got up quickly with a start
        ran and descended to the river'.
  The first line might be interpreted as a combination of particles of compatible
semantics, gud more general in that it designates arising, getting up, and wardabarrb
more specific in that while it implies arising, it also specifies the manner in which it is
done as sudden, or unexpected. Both gud and wardabarrb normally occur (in
intransitive clauses) with finite verb gaju-. That is, it is probably not appropriate to see
wardabarrb as the particle of a truncated or ellipsed clause, but as the second member
of a particle combination with gud. In the second line, however, we may posit that
yirrgulun judjud are members of an incompletely specified predication ""and descended
to the river"". Indications that this string never achieves clausal status are: first, that
yirrgulun is Absolutive, instead of Allative as one might expect in a fully developed
clause; and secondly, \hatjudjud normally occurs with we- in the meaning 'descend',
and therefore may be interpreted as occurring here without finite verb. The latter point
is somewhat equivocal, for judjud also regularly occurs with the verbs of motion 'go'
and 'come'; however, given the lack of case-marking on 'river', we may interpret this as
a textually-cohesive fragment, rather than as a particle-combination with finite verb να-.
  A passage similar in context occurs further on in the same text from which (622) was
drawn:(623)    gayardung      0-yanggi              gunya            yirrgulu-warr         barrwa

        black soil-LOC
258 Chapter 10
        'He ran away from him and down to the river
        along the river and came up and out on black soil'.
  Here the particlejudjud is once again apparently not directly paired with a finite verb
(though the ""river"", the place to which the subject descended, is regularly case-marked).
The meaning is perfectly clear because of the surrounding specification of the nature and
direction of action.(624)   galul wurr-(y)anggi           worroman-bi        gayardung        julu-ya

        duba
        sit-PS
        'They ran up quickly and sat down on the hill'.
   The particle duba is here without finite verb, normally.//«!»/-, but again its absence does
not impair intelligibility.
   Although such unpaired particles commonly occur tone-group finally, as so far
illustrated, they may also occur in other positions, especially group-initially:(625)   wardarl          0-yana-rri           ngawun
        struggle         3SG-AUX-PST          nothing        new        wardang         0-wudba-rri
        grab       belly-up        3SG-AUX-PST
        'She struggled, nothing [to no avail]
        he grabbed and threw her belly-up'.
  The particle new 'grab' is unpaired; it usually occurs with me-, and does not occur by
itself in combination with \vudba- (which as independent verb means 'throw', and
obviously retains some ofthat semantic content in its combination with wardang). 'Grab'
in such a construction as this obviously has the same nominal arguments as wardang.
  While further above were illustrated kinds of particle combinations which may be seen
as members of a single finite clause, in the immediate preceding examples we have what
should be regarded as particle adjuncts of less than full clausal status to a single clause.
These adjuncts add to the development of text, and are related to the fully specified clause
in a way that presupposes the sharing of major arguments and argument functions by the
particles, and the applicability of other verbal categories (tense-aspect) to the additional
particle as well as to the clause as a whole. These constructions cannot, however, taken
to be serialized ones insofar as ""serialization"" is understood to mean the regular
combination of predicates in determinate lexical meanings. The constructions illustrated
here are textual ones, i.e. not essentially analyzable at the clause level, though they
certainly interact with and are constrained by clause-level structure. The particle
adjunction effects a close textual linkage between the major clausal predicate(s) and the
adjoined one. This packaging of narrative material is most closely comparable to the
inclusion, within a single tone-group, of more than one finite clause. While comparable,
these processes must be distinguished.

 Inclusion of two full clauses within a single tone group is common, although it is
unusual in the narratives collected for a tone group to contain MORE than TWO clauses.
Examples of two clauses within a single tone unit follow.(626) belgin             wurr-ngu-ndi         wurr-wemi-yi-rri

  These examples show that, in the textual linking of two full clauses by prosodic means
only, although it often happens that the two finite verbs share an object, or (perhaps better
put) presuppose the same object, they may in fact have different subjects and/or objects.
(629) illustrates different subjects of the two prosodically-Iinked predicates, the linkage
highlighting precisely their opposite direction of movement: as one went down the other
went up. The prosodic linkage of full clauses on a tone unit, then, is an even more
explicitly ""textual"" (rather than ""grammatical"") device than is particle adjunction; for
the latter operates in terms of the sharing of core arguments among all predicate
constituents and the controlling of verbal categories by the finite verb.

      Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements
11.1. Introduction: Special properties of particlesMany languages in this region, like Wardaman, have predicate structures of more than
one kind, some of which consist of more than one word. Verbal construction types were
described in 8.1., and the distinction was made between predicate structures consisting
only of finite verb, and those consisting of verbal ""particle"" (following some long-
standing Australianist usage, see Dixon ed. 1976) and finite verb. We saw that among
the finite verbs which may occur as predicators by themselves, with full lexical meaning,
are high-frequency verbs (including most of the CV- roots) which also occur widely with
verb particles, to constitute most of the language's verbal lexicon. It was shown that
there is moderate flexibility in alternative pairings of the same particle with different
verbs, and that this kind of alternation, besides making differences in lexical meaning,
also instantiates differences in clause-level transitivity in what was accordingly termed
a ""lexico-syntactic"" manner. This kind of transitivity system is consistent with the fact
that there tends to be a strong coincidence between particular verb and either transitive
or intransitive clause type (e.g., bu-, gi- etc. transitive, jingi- intransitive). However, a
simple dichotomy between transitive and intransitive clauses and/or predicates was
argued to be inappropriate, mainly because of the considerable degree to which verbs
which, as clausal predicates by themselves determine transitive clause structure, with
particles may instantiate the Absolutive-Dative clause type.
  Although particle plus verb constructions occur in many other languages of the area,
their range of functions is rather distinctive of the group of presumed congeners including
Wardaman (for Wakiman, see Cook 1987 Chapter 9; the same range of functions is
indicated by the more limited material available for Yangman). Particles in these
languages have at least two major functions: first, they productively occur with finite
verbs to express predicate meanings; and second, case-marked in a number of ways that
will be described in this chapter, they form clausal complements. It is in this second
range of functions that the particle system of Wardaman and congeners is particularly
distinctive, as compared with other regional languages. For example in the languages
immediately to the east (of the Wardaman-Yangman dialect continuum), Mangarrayi and
Alawa, particle plus verb constitutes the usual kind of predicate construction. But the
extent to which particles in those languages may be used in adclausal complement
constructions is very limited, and in particular, there is no parallel to the Allative-marked
complements described in 11.4.3. and 11.7. Though the particle plus verb construction
type of all of these languages is superficially similar, the differences in syntactic
distribution of the particles support the view that we are not dealing with similar syntactic
systems. There appear, also, to be some, much more minor differences between
Wardaman and Wakiman in the way that particles function: in Wardaman they do not
262 Chapter 11
occur alone, without finite verb, as imperative utterances (Cook 1987: 253). This
difference may be related to some others, e.g., the fact that the 'particle suffix' in
Wardaman (11.1.2.) cannot be clearly associated with aspectual categorial meaning in
the way it apparently can in Wakiman (Cook 1987: 235).","[277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285, 286]"
"  Demonstratives are also freely used in two-word noun phrases where the second
element does not itself name an entity, but where the reference of the nominal word is
assumed to be otherwise established or known:(537) nana yiwarnagari            'the other (one)'

  Demonstratives may also b; found in a phrase with a second genitive or dative
pronominal word, where it may be assumed that the entity word has been ellipsed:(539) nana go           'the οη<ϊ of his/hers'  Although the order DEM + Ν is the most common, the reverse order is also found. This
is examined further for phrases containing the Proximate demonstrative in 10.9. Though
we have said that DEM + N ord<;r is the most common, it is important to note an exception
to this: that those demonstrate e forms termed ""collective"", characterized by ending in
-ganung following one of the demonstrative stems (7.2.), typically follow the nominal
that they specify:(540)    bangbun       dang-ganung      wunggunburr-ga-ndi                   gunya

        'The grass came walking'.
  (Note that where the specified nominal is non-human, it is treated in verbal prefixation
as if singular, despite ""collective"" suffixation on the demonstrative.) There are however
exceptions to the generalization that collective forms tend to follow the nominal:(543)   wunggunburr-ga-ndi-wan            nan-ganung-nyi        yibiyan-yi
        3NSG/3NSG-take-PST-DF             that-COL-ERG          man-ERG
        'Those Aborigines took them away'.
  In two-word noun phrases containing a number word and lexical noun, there appear to
be slightly more cases in which the number word precedes the nominal. This tendency
is most noticeable in respect to the number words lege One', guyamin 'two', and
murrgun 'three'; whereas in phrases with nominal modified by ngawurnen 'many', the
modifier seems equally likely to precede or follow. Examples of the most frequent
ordering are:(544)   guyamin-yi      mulurru-wuya-yi
        two-ERG         old woman-DU-ERG
        'Two old women'.(545)   0-jingi-ndi-ya           murrgun            gandawag
        3SG-be-PST-NAR           three-ABS          moon-ABS
        'She would stay for three months'.
 An instance of the slightly less common ordering is:(546)   a        0-na-rri        marluga            lege
        oh       3SG-see-PST     oldman-ABS         one-ABS
        'Ah! he saw one old man'.
  With respect to the textual frequency of numbers generally, it might seem that because
the language has morphological categories that express dual number, the numeral ""two""
would be infrequent. This is not so, however; there is rather a tendency for ""two"" to be
expressed pleonastically in noun phrases where dual is also overtly marked. (See e.g.,
the text Mejern, line 235, for examples such as bangbu-wuya guyamin woman-DU-ABS
two-ABS, 'two women'.)
  Interrogative modifiers invariably precede the nominal:(547)   ngamanda        menyin            yiwun-wo-ndi              mululurru
         what-ABS       cheek-ABS         2SG/3NSG-give-PST         old woman rdp-ABS

        who-ABS            old man-ABS
        'Which old man'? or 'Old man who?'.
  Indefinites tend to precede tt e nominal with which they occur, but the reverse order is
also found:(549) yiwarna-mulu           yib'.yan-mulu
      other-PL-ABS           mai-PL-ABS

        'Some children'.
  The structure of possessive loun phrases is discussed in 10.4. Where possession is
expressed by genitive pronoun modifying the nominal, the order pronoun-nominal is
most common in the textual corpus. However, here again the opposite order, though less
common, is certainly well attes :ed. In (551) the most common order is illustrated; in (552)
both orders are illustrated.(551) yinggawun-mulu              wurre-mulu

  Of the many other qualifiers which specify properties or characteristics of entities (e.g.,
of size, shape, colour, texture, condition of use, taste etc.), it may be suggested that word
length may have something to do with ordering freedom with respect to a modified
nominal. It is in any event noticeable that several short modifiers (ones of no more than
two syllables, e.g., -jad 'big', \vudu 'little', and -man 'good') may apparently occur
indifferently before or after tht modified nominal, for example:(553)   wudu         wumunb.irra              yani-ma jurd-ba
        little-ABS   WU-rock-ABS             thus-PS show-PS

(554)   gabarani         wudu
        oops-ABS         little-ABS
        'His little unmentionable'.
  It may be the case that qualifiers of two or three syllables (including noun class prefix),
no matter what their semantic type, have the greatest freedom of occurrence either before
or after the nominal. Certainly they seem to precede the nominal more often than do
longer modifiers. Other examples are:(555)   wangi            wu-juda               madin
        only             WU-short-ABS          word-ABS

        YI-old-ABS       woman-ABS          that-ABS
        'That's an old [i.e., long-term pregnant] woman'.
 Longer modifiers tend to follow the noun, but this ordering is by no means absolute.
The reverse order is acceptable, if less common.(557)   barrangardba       wu-warringun
        throat-ABS         WU-bad-ABS
        'Bad throat, sore throat'.(558)   wurrguru         yi-wungij-gun

        food-AB S       M Α-round-AB S
        Ά round vegetable'.
  When demonstrative and longer qualifier occur in the same tone group with a modified
nominal, demonstrative always occurs in first position, and there is a strong tendency for
the qualifier to occur flanking the nominal on the right:(561) nana              marluga             yi-belyangman
      that-ABS          old man-ABS         YI-red-ABS
        'That old part-Aboriginal [""red""] man'.

  This tendency is also true of modifiers formed with ""having"" suffix, which in general
tend to follow any open-class nominal with which they occur, e.g., nana marluga
wiya-warang 'the old drunk man'. This tendency is not apparently as strong with the
shorter qualifiers, e.g., nana wi'.du wurren 'the small child' and nana yijad wurren 'the
big child' are perfectly acceptable, as is e.g., nana wurren yijad.
  Although the indefinite qualifier yiwarnagari 'a different one, another' is long, it
appears to have considerable freedom of occurrence, pre- or post-nominal, in two-word
and longer noun phrases, e.g. yiwarnagari laglan or laglan yiwarnagari 'another,
different camp'. As noted in 5.9., there is a tendency for the concept of ""difference"" or
otherness to be marked pleonas ically on the nominal as well as by this modifier, and this
appears to happen where thi modifier precedes the nominal, e.g., yiwarnagari
laglan-gari 'a different camp'. It may be noted, also, that when it precedes the nominal
it may occur in a shortened form, minus -gari: yiwarna bangbun 'another woman',
yiwarna wiyan 'next year, another year'. The latter phrase is in fact standard in the
meaning 'next year, next rainy season'. (One does not standardly find yiwarna wiyan-
gari as a set phrase.) Yiwarnagari invariably follows any occurring demonstrative.(562)   lurrbu yirr-(y)anggi: nan-garr              marluga-warr         yiwarnagari-warr

        3SG-DAT
        'We went home to her other old man'.
  An example of a noun phrases with pronominal head (""me"") and further specification
of location is:(563) jumba          jingi       nganunya           banggin-ya
       behind        sit         1SG-DISS           back-LOC
        'Sit behind me/at my back'.
  Alternatively, a meaning of ι he above sort may be constructed with a nominal head
(""back"") and possessive pronoun (here an independent dative one):(564) jumba             nga-jim>i-ndi        go               banggin-ya
       behind           ISG-sii-PST          3SG-DAT          back-LOC
        Ί sat behind him/at the back of him'.
   Both pronominal and nominal heads in the two examples above occur in relation to but
separate from the adverbial jumba 'behind' , and it is common for only adverbial and verb
to occur (jumba jingi 'sit behind'). See 10.4. for further discussion of possession.
   Some three-word noun phrases have already been illustrated in examples above, and
it should be clear that they are lot uncommon, although certainly they are textually less
frequent than two- or one-word ones. Common enough types include those with
demonstrative, open-class noriinal and semantically adjectival nominal (nana mayin
me-belbelin 'the/that round vegetable food'), and those with genitive pronominal first in
234 Chapter 10
the phrase followed by nominal and qualifier, where the order of the latter two is
apparently not fixed but depends on other factors. For example, one may encounter
nganinggin yiwarlng yibirrba or nganinggin yibirrba yiwarlng 'my old clothes', where
the condition-of-use qualifier shows the flexibility of ordering we have already noted for
many (apparently relatable to the length of the modifying word). However, as we have
already noted, collective-marked demonstratives strongly tend to follow any nominal
with which they occur, and this was found to always be the case in such examples in
phrases of more than two words: nganinggin yiwarlng dan-ganung 'my clothes, these
clothes of mine'.
  Expansions of simpler noun phrase types are possible with the occurrence of adverbials
and inflected nouns which elaborate the reference of an adjectival or open-class nominal,
or number word functioning as phrasal head. Such adverbials and embedded phrases
often express such notions as origin or source, for example:(565)   gangma-wunba                 yi-nebel
        kangaroo-SOU-AB S            ΥΙ-shoulder bone-ABS
        'The shoulder bone of/from a kangaroo'.(566) gorro-wunba-wuya             guyamin
      south-SOU-DU-ABS             two-ABS
        'The pair of them from the south'.
  Somewhat uncommonly, such elaborations may result in phrases of up to four words
occurring on one tone unit, rarely more than that:(567)   yiwarnagari      dawung-jila          gorro-wunba        bangbun
        other-ABS        thatway-ORIG         south-SOU          woman-ABS
        Ά foreign woman from that way to the south'.
  Some definite ordering tendencies within the phrase may be given as follows:
  (1) in noun phrases with pronominal head (such as yirrug-bulu yi-nimanyug-bulu 'we
EXCL people of Nimanyug') the pronominal occurs initially, followed by any modifier,
including number word.
  (2) in non-pronominal noun phrases, demonstratives generally occur preceding any
nominal, except as noted in the case of the collective-marked demonstrative forms, which
strongly tend to follow any occurring nominal. Also, number words (especially those
from one to three) tend to precede any nominal with which they occur, but this is a much
weaker tendency than the former. Genitive pronouns tend to precede the nominal they
modify, but this too is a weaker tendency than the first.
  (3) other modifiers — roughly, adjectival ones — tend to follow the modified nominal;
but certain very common ones of three syllables or less appear to have greater freedom
of ordering, either preceding or following the modified nominal.
  See also below some discussion of ordering in the possessive phrase (10.4.), in ""classifier""
or generic-specific constructions (10.5.), in the negated noun phrase (10.6.); and in
discontinuous phrases (10.7.).

"11.4.2. Nominalized purpose complements (of finite verbs)The purposive complement derived from a finite verb is built on the nominalized form
of the stem with the suffix -yin (H.3.), and any major objective argument of the
complement in Dative case. Nominalized forms of finite verbs, like particles, cannot
inflect for person; and so here, as in particle purposive complements, subject-object
relations of the complement are understood in terms of the relations in the main clause.
The system of ""control"" from the main clause cannot, then, be viewed as a grammatically
highly explicit one, for interpretation of the same complement clause could vary with the
sense established in the main clause.
278 Chapter 11(668)   ma-nga-nyanga-n      yinggi                 ngorlog-ba-wu      jewu-yin

  (668) contains two purpose complements: the first, ngorlogbawu 'to talk'; the second,
a purposive nominalization of the finite verbjewu- 'show, teach' (a ditransitive clausal
predicate). Such a nominalized complementizer cannot, as already noted, be inflected
for person, and so there are two ways in which the (intended) subject-object relations of
the complement are understood: first, in relation to the sense conveyed by the
grammatical structure of the main clause; and second (optionally, and not realized here
in the complement) for the semantic object of the complement to be made explicit by a
Dative free pronoun. In this example, since ""I"" always come to ""you"" for talk, the
complement is understood to continue the same subject-object relations. The intended
object ""me"", however, could also be realized by 1SG DAT pronoun nganu.(669)   ya-wud-janga-n           jejbarla-yin                wu-munburra-wu

        'They are coming to ask for money'.
  In (669) the complement has nominalized form ofjejbarla- 'ask', and object of the
complement ""money"" in Dative case, as it would also normally be in a finite clause with
this predicate, the person asked for money the direct object. The person being asked is
not made explicit here, but could be a free Dative pronoun. Despite this possibility,
Purposive complements tend to be infrequent in the text material gathered, and the few
that occur are simple, usually having only one Dative-marked argument of the
complement clause. These Purpose complements are distinct from the Allative-marked
ones discussed in 12.4.3., however, in that the main clause predicate may be transitive.(670) ngan-jewu-rri              ginyi-yin [ginye-yi-yin]       mayi-wu

        'He showed me how to cook [the] food'.
  Just as in (669) where the main clause predicate was intransitive, in (670) the argument
structure of the main clause ditransitive verb jewu- is understood to apply to the
complement.
  The main clause may overtly consist of just a nominal argument with zero copula verb
of being or existence, as in the following two examples.(671) gilidji                     lorrodbi-yin               jimirndi-wu

  Informants produced alternatives to (672) with Dative-marked predicate loyi-wu, and
such ""dativization"" of the bare stem of finite verbs is occasionally found.
  Some elicited purpose complements of this kind seemed to be used in relation to a
general purpose, so that the construction could appear with no Dative-marked argument
in the complement clause.(673)   yanja              yo-yi-yin
        3SG go-PRES        spear-NOM-PURP
        'He is going to spear [something], spearing/hunting'.
  Finally, mention needs to be made of a Purposive formation possible with finite verbs
which, in terms of formal properties, makes them superficially similar to particles in that
they add the particle suffix form -ma, following a textually rare Purposive suffix of the
shape -ye-. The sole textual example of this construction that indicated its existence was
the following, with some surrounding context:(674)   dan-beng        wud-jingi-ndi-ya
        this-SSPEC      3NSG-sit-PST-NAR
        loye-ma

        wu-lo-yi-rri-ya
        3NSG-dance-MED-PST-NAR
        'They were here
        for dancing
        what kind of thing? murdu [name of a kind of women's line dance]
        they danced'.
  The larger context was a visit by a party of us women to a site mythologically associated
with ancestral female figures, who were said to come here to hold line-dances. As the
speaker spoke the first line she was indicating the place where the ancestral women sat,
""for dancing"". Despite its textual rarity, informants were readily able to produce such
forms in elicitation.
  The form of this Purposive complement is -ye-ma, regardless of the final vowel of the
finite stem. Especially following a stem-final a, there may be reduction of that vowel
plus -ye- to -e-, as in gurrgbe-ma 'for sleeping', i.e., the mid-vowel quality remains
unaltered. Also, as example (674) shows, following the mediopassive element -yi- we
do not find *loyi-ye-ma, but rather loye-ma 'for dancing'.
  Though the -ye-ma Purposive construction was exceedingly rare textually, it is
important to repeat that the Purposive construction with -yin was rare, too. This may
280 Chapter 11reflect the general syntactic flexibility possible in this language within the limits of finite
clause structure.
   Comparatively, the Purposive construction in -ye-ma is reminiscent of a Purposive
suffix recorded with Wakiman PARTICLES (Cook 1987: 235), which in that language
precedes the Dative suffix -gu. This combination of Purposive suffix plus Dative is
apparently of the form -ay-gu-, but there are problems in this segmentation. This
Purposive suffix in Wakiman FOLLOWS the particle suffix -ma in many forms, and
otherwise often occurs following an a which is the final segment of a particle root. Thus
it may be that the Purposive suffix here ought to be segmented (if definitively at all) as
-y- before -gu. However segmented, in the Wakiman Purposive sequence -ay- we have
a form which may perhaps be compared with the Wardaman purposive ending -ye-ma
(though the discrepancy in ordering of the Purposive suffix after -ma in Wakiman, and
before it in Wardaman, requires further consideration). On the other hand, both the
Wakiman form and Wardaman -ye- may be etymologically related to the Wardaman
nominalizer -yi-, although the exact nature of such correspondences would need to be
established. The form -ye-ma is unusual among Wardaman inflectional and derivational
morphemes in having a clear mid-vowel. Thus it cannot be treated as a synchronic
contraction, but must be regarded as a long-term morpho-syntactic retention in the
language.
  Purposive -ye-ma never occurred spontaneously with major complement objective
argument, but informants in elicitation produced dative objective arguments in relation
to the construction, as in (675), and (676).(675) jomarna-ye-ma           ya-wud-janga-n                    ngarrugu

  In Type 1, the noun phrase consists of a single lexical noun or personal pronoun, and
there is no phrase-internal syntax.
  Type 2 has a clause-level constituent, and is a cover term for the general subordinate
clause type discussed in 8.15., and for the complex particle and nominalized verbal
complementizers which are discussed in Chapter 11. As is noted there, such
complements tend to be syntactically truncated, with minimal overt specification of
participants, with the exception of the allative-marked object of a complement (11.7.).
  Several sub-types of head-attribute construction are shown in 3. 3(a) stands for the
common construction in which a demonstrative modifies the head; as noted above, and
further discussed in 10.9 below, there is variation is ordering of the elements, but ageneral
tendency for most demonstratives to precede the modified, most of the time. 3(b) stands
for a number of other sub-types, in which an interrogative, indefinite or other qualifier
modifies the head, and there may be some kind of adverbial modifying element. Type
3(c) stands for the possessive phrase, of several particular types as discussed: possessor
expressed by genitive pronoun (tending to precede the head), by dative pronoun
following it, or both together flanking it; or nominal possessor expressed by dative-
marking on the possessor and agreement with an independent dative pronoun. Finally, 4
represents a coordinate noun phrase structure which may now be considered briefly.
  It is common enough for semantically and syntactically related noun phrases to occur
on separate tone units, each one in some way adding information to the others. For
example, in a myth concerning porcupine, her husband goes out hunting and runs into
some birds, one kind of which, manamanagban (honeyeater?) is explicitly mentioned:
'He caught up to the honeyeaters, they were calling to him'. The tale continues:(599) ngawurnen     manamanagban
      many-ABS      honeyeater-ABS
      'Many honeyeaters'
244 Chapter 10        golorog-bari              wejbu-ma
        peaceful dove-NOM         mix-PS
        'together with peaceful doves'.
  There is no question that such are to be seen as separate phrases, and indeed the
identification and qualification of participants in separate tone units in this way is a
regular feature of Wardaman texts. Whether phrases in separate tone units refer to the
same entity in different ways, or designate different entities which in many instances may
be construed as having the same role within the text as above, it is out of the question to
regard these as sub-parts of the same phrase.
  However, it is also common for nouns to occur together within the same tone unit,
identically case-marked and sharing a participant role, but without overt coordinator. In
fact, there is little evidence of explicit coordination in Wardaman. It would seem that
such elements as the ""focal member of pair"" suffix (5.6.1.) imply coordination, even
though the second member of the pair NEED NOT be explicitly designated, but may be
mentioned (as in the example ngabida-warrma nawurla, see (528) above). Coordination
is achieved simply by juxtaposition, and Type 4 allows for this.(600)   gulid-gu       buda-wu        0-yanggi                bogogo     gunya    na_
        green plum-DAT black plum-DAT 3SG-go-PS               hunt       3SG-DISS [now]
        'She went away from her now foraging for green and black plum'.
  A few special issues which relate to coordination are worthy of mention here. There
are some textual examples in which one finds apparently coordinate nouns, identically
marked with case or adverbial ending, but where their having the same grammatical role
within the clause appears counterintuitive. Consider for example in the text Onion, line
30. Here two girls who are preparing food are being cajoled by a man to give him what
they are cooking. One of them hesitates, because of the flirtatious implications of a
woman giving a man cooked food; but the other girl urges her to give it. She does so,
and the man takes the meat, cuts raw onion on top of it, and eats it. The line of interest
is:(601) anyin-barra         layln-barra      0-ngu-ndi          girdibun
      [onion]-ADV         meat-ADV         3SG-eat-PST        finish
        'He ate the meat and onion up'.
  One might expect onion to be marked with the adverbial, comitative ending, for the
idea being conveyed is that he ate the meat WITH onion. But instead, both ""onion"" and
""meat"" are marked with the adverbial ending. Nothing is expressed as direct object.
  Consider another example which is different in some respects, but basically similar in
that an unexpected ""spreading"" of case-marking appears to be involved. In the text
Goyin, there is description of bees depositing eggs in the comb. It is said that the honey
body (yi-nyeyn) extends right up to/towards the ""nose"" of the honey-comb. ""Nose"" is
allative-marked (see 5.2.5.). The lines of interest are reproduced below:
                                                        Issues in constituency and word order 245
(602)   yi-nyeyn                   yi-jurn-garr-min
        YI-body-ABS                YI-nose-ALL-ADV
        'The honey body up to/towards the nose'        yi-jum-garr        nan-garr          goyi-warr
        YI-nose-ALL        that-ALL         honey-ALL
        'to the nose ofthat honey'.
  We might expect the apparent possessor (or whole of which yijurn is a part), goyin
'honey', to be dative marked. Instead we find that it is allative marked like ""nose"".
Another instance of similar kind can be seen in the text Elsie (46) (see also discussion in
10.4. above, insofar as this last example poses questions about ""classifying""
constructions).
  These have the appearance of 'coordinate' phrases like the one exemplified in (600),
but present an anomaly in that commonly marked nominals would seem to have different
semantic case roles in the clause. Evidently these are instances of the ""spread"" of case-
and adverbial marking across a number of co-occurring nominal constituents.","[267, 268, 269]"
"
6.7. Person-marking in the verb
Every finite verb in Wardaman is prefixed with pronominal(s) expressing the category
of grammatical subject for all clauses, and also the category of direct object if the clause
is transitive. As noted in 5.2., the Wardaman verb has a maximum of two pronominal
form-order slots, filled by two pronominal series which are called ""subject"" and ""object"".
In ditransitive clauses — i.e., those with predicates which occur in construction with two
major, Absolutive non-subject nominals — the notional indirect rather than direct object
is marked in the pronominal complex by the object prefix series, and of course the
transitive agent by means of the subject pronominal series. The notional direct object
cannot be marked on the verb in the ditransitive clause.
  Table 6 shows the set of prefixes which mark the subject in intransitive clauses, i.e.,
the set, members of which occur as sole pronominal adjuncts to the verb. Tables 7 and
8 show the transitive-clause prefix combinations, those with both subject and object slots
filled. The morphology of the intransitive subject prefixes is uncomplicated, and the
morpheme divisions can be shown simply alongside the occurring forms in one table.
The transitive ones, however, are not simply analyzable in all instances as the subject
prefixes combined with a segmentable object series; some forms are morphologically
124 Chapter 6 more complicated, or portmanteau-like, than this. Hence two kinds of tables are given
 for the transitive combinations, one showing the occurring forms of the prefix
 combinations, and the second positing morpheme identity and segmentatioa
   Two factors complicate the discussion of the prefixes, and need to be introduced. It is
 useful to make a basic distinction between ""past"" and ""non-past"" Wardaman verbal tense-
 mood-aspect categories; and it is necessary, further, to recognize a distinction between
 ""indicative"" or ""realis"" versus ""irrealis"" forms of the verb. The former distinction allows
 us to state in relation to it the distribution of a third-person, initial prefix element να-:
this occurs on third person ""non-past"" forms of the verb, including Present, Future,
Potential and Admonitive (""lest"" etc.) forms, and does not occur in the Past tense (nor in
mood categories including Hortative and Imperative). The initial non-past third person
element να- is not explicitly a person marker, but is linked to person categories in the
following way: it occurs only on non-past forms with third person subject as the sole
pronominal category in the verb, or in transitive combinations where third person is both
subject and object. Thus, 3SG PRES ya-0-nyanga-n 'he/she/it is coming' with -0-
marking the 3SG category\ya-wud-janga-n 'they (NSG) are coming' with /wurr/ (see
3.5.1.) marking the 3NSG category; ya-0-nyangi-we 'he/she/it will come', PUT;
ya-0-nyanga-yan 'he/she/it may come' POT. In the transitive 3                * 3 combinations,
the initial να- absorbs or represents a contraction of the usual prefix segments as these
may be seen from the Past forms, where the initial ya- does not occur. Compare for
example, 3SG            > 3NSG and 3NSG              * 3NSG in Present and Past tenses:                           Past                        Present
3SG         »3NSG        wwtggim-bii-ndi            yanggnn-bit-n            'he hit/is hitting
                                                                               them'
3NSG—*· 3NSG            wimggwibiirr-bu-ncu         yanggunbiirr-bii-n       'they hit/are
                                                                              hitting them'
  For reasons that will become clearer when the prefixal morphology is examined in
detail, wiinggnn- must be identified as the basic shape of the 3SG                 »3NSG
combination. On that basis, in the present we would expect ya-wmggun- but instead
find the actually-occurring form to be contracted, as showa In 3SG                  »3SG
combinations, both subject and object pronominals are zero, and the initial prefix ya-
occurs as the only prefixal element, i.e., (pedantically)ya-0-O-bii-n 'he/she/it is hitting
him/her/it'. (In texts and interlinear glosses double zeroes in 3SG                 »3SG
combinations are not written in this way).
  The second, greater complication in the prefix system is one involving the marking of
the major mood distinction between indicative and irrealis forms. In terms of this
contrast, indicative categories are unmarked, and irrealis marked The marking of irrealis
is implemented in two ways, and in some forms both occur: by an outer mood prefix of
the shapeyi- for (most) non-third person (except 1EX NSG) categories, andya-yi- for
third person categories; and by some differences, compared with indicative inflection, in
the form of the person-marking pronominals themselves. In the irrealis mood third
person complex ya-yi-, the first element may probably be identified with the initial
                                              Independent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 125
non-past ya- described above7, and the ->'/- with the irrealis prefix shape which occurs
with other persons. Since the mood prefixes are easily segmented from the pronominals,
there are no phonological distortions of the kind illustrated above with non-past ya-; but
the important observation to be made is a morpho-syntactic one, that morphological
irrealis verb forms inflect for person and number somewhat differently than the
corresponding indicative forms. In this way, mood and person-marking are linked
systems, just as tense-aspect and person-marking are, in the presence or absence of initial
non-past ya-, also linked systems.
  For clarity of presentation, all indicative prefix forms will be discussed first, and a final
section will make explicit the differences between person-marking in indicative and
irrealis verb forms. The verbal categories themselves are discussed elsewhere
(Chapter 8).","[147, 148, 149]"

5.2. Nominal case suffixesWardaman case categories and suffixal forms are:
      Ergative/instrumental                      -yi, -ji, -nyi
      Absolutive                                 -in, -n, -0
      Dative/genitive/purposive                  -gu, -wu
      Locative                                   -ya, -ja
      Allative                                   -garr, -warr
      Ablative                                   -ba, -wa
      Dissociative                               -gunya, -wunya
      Source                                     -gunba, -wunba
      Originative                                -jila  Alternations have been discussed in Chapter 3.
64 Chapters  Before each case category is described and illustrated, the relation between nominal
cases and marking of case relations in the two prefixal slots on the verb can be briefly
summarized.
  The Wardaman verb maximally bears two pronominal prefixes which relate to noun
phrases in the clause. In keeping with this, there are two distinguishable prefixal form-
order classes (subject and object). Subject of the intransitive verb is coded by subject
pronominals in the verb and by Absolutive case in the noun; transitive subject by subject
pronominals in the verb and by Ergative case in the noun, and direct object of the
transitive verb by object pronominals in the verb and Absolutive case in the noun. In
ditransitive clauses (""my father gave me to them""), the nominal agent (""father"") is
Ergative-marked and coded by subject pronominal on the verb, while the semantic
indirect object (""them"") is coded by object pronominals in the verb, the semantic direct
object (""me"") cannot be coded on the verb, and both notional ""indirect"" and ""direct""
external (nominal or pronominal) objects are Absolutive case. (See further 8.17.)
  The case system is the same for all types of nominal: pronouns, demonstratives,
interrogative pronouns, nouns and adjectival nouns.","[87, 88]"
"5.2.2. Absolutive caseSome functions of Absolutive case have already been summarized: it is the case of the
intransitive subject and the direct object, and of both notional ""indirect"" and ""direct""
object nominals in ditransitive clauses. It is also the usual case-form of the notional agent
in clauses without identifiable, grammatical direct object, that is, in which any second
participant is not marked in the verb, but is in Dative (or other, oblique) case-form.
Absolutive is the usual ""citation"" form which informants use to mention the word for
something.
                                                    Nominal classes, inflection and derivation 69  A further illustration of Absolutive marking the intransitive subject function is:(24)   yibiyan      0-yanggi        durd   0-me-ndi-ya                            gamin

       wiyan-wan             0-nyanga-ndi
       water-ABS-DF           3SG-come-PST
       'The man went and grabbed his spear as the water came ...'.
  Here ""man"" and ""water"" function as intransitive subjects, ""spear"" äs transitive object.
  Absolutive is also the nominal complement of the verb in certain predications:(25)   ngayal           0-bu-ndi               warlanin
       flower-ABS       3SG-AUX-PST           coolibah-ABS
       'The coolibah flowered'.(26)   yi-gulan            nge-we-n                  gila
       YI-ear-ABS          1 SG-fall-PRES             indeed
       'I've actually forgotten'.
  One of the ways of saying ""to forget"" is with verb we- (which otherwise means'to fall'),
and Absolutive-marked ""ear"", the complement. Similar to this are many predications
with nominal complement mejern 'stomach', e.g., mejern lud-ba jingi- ('stomach',
particle lud-ba, and AUX jingi-) 'to be happy, glad' (with possible Dative complement
""concerning which"").
  Absolutive is the case of the nominal subject of verbless predications:(27)   jewed-ba         yirrigu             madin
        share-PS        1EXNSG DAT          language-AB S
       'We all have the same language, we are ""company"" for language'.
  The predicative function seems to be filled by jewedba, and the 1EXNSG Dative
pronoun expresses those with respect to whom language is shared. An alternative
analysis might treat ""our language"" as constituents of a single phrase, with jewedba again
in predicative function.(28)   yi-meleman    bujun     yinyang            milygbilyg-ba      yini-jingi-n

       3SG-DAT      child-DAT
       'If you [SG] were black your heart would beat/be apprehensive for the child'
       [undergoing initiation].
 Here, ""black"" and 2SG independent pronoun are Absolutive in case form, ""black"" the
non-verbal predicator.
70 Chapters(29)   yilama            wurrugu            yi-man              yibiwan

        'Supposedly he was a good fellow to them'.
 The above is a verbless predication with Absolutive phrase ""good man''.
 Finally, the subject of the verb made reflexive or reciprocal is not Ergative-marked, but
Absolutive-marked:(30)   dang-guya          yarrula-wuya        dirlyag-ba             yawu-da-yi-n
       that-DU-ABS        young person-DU-ABS sweetheart             3NSG-AUX-RR-PRES

       YI-eye-ABS           3NSG-make-RR-PRES
        'That young couple are sweet on each other, they're making eyes at each other'.
  In (30), ""two young people"" is Absolutive-marked, in keeping with the fact that the
predicate dirlyag-ba na-yi- is (reflexive)-reciprocal. (The figure of ""making eyes at""
appears to be indigenous to Wardaman; in fact, yimum 'eye' is used to mean""sweetheart"",
so the last part of the example is to be understood something like, 'they are making
sweethearts of each other'.)5.2.3. Dative caseThe suffix -gu ~ -wu occurs in constructions both of genitive, and general oblique (dative
or purposive) types. There is, as noted, no marking on the verb for nominals or noun
phrases in either of these functions, unless (in the case of the genitive nominal or phrase)
it also fills a major syntactic function within the clause.
   The major formal means of placing an additional argument in construction with the
verb in Wardaman is by means of a Dative complement, expressing relations of the kind
""for, to, in respect to, concerning"". As illustrated above in (11 - 13), there are certain
verbs which demand ditransitive clausal construction, in which both major object types
are Absolutive-marked in the nominal, the notional indirect (human, animate) object the
one marked in the object pronominal slot on the verb. But there are verbs of very similar
meaning to these ditransitives, that determine clausal construction in which there is an
agent, and a complement, ""object of the action"", which goes into the Dative case.
Examples were given in (12 - 13). An additional Dative argument is often placed in
relation to both intransitive and transitive verbs. Examples are:(31)   ngarr-ya          jarrambu            wuja-wu
       1 INPL-go          looking            wood-DAT
       'Let's go looking for wood '.(32)   marranyin         me       nganu
       sugar-ABS        get       1 SG DAT
       'Get sugar for me' [marranyin = 'sand', 'sugar'].
                                                    Nominal classes, inflection and derivation 71(33)   bog-bame       wiyan                 wurre-wu           ya-0-ba-n-ga

       sun-INST
       'Dip some water for the child [who's] hot in the sun'.(34)   nginngin          ngan-da-rri                mayi-wu
       say no            3SG/1SG-AUX-PST            food-DAT
       'He refused me food' [said no to me about food].
  The most literal meaning of the verb particle nginngin seems to be 'to shake head no',
but ""refusal"" is also understood to be tantamount to being ""jealous concerning"", and
nginngin is often translated in this way in Kriol. The particle may enter into construction
with verb bu-, in which case both person refused and the thing concerning which refusal
is made, are typically Dative complements:(35)   nginngin         0-bu-ndi             nganu             mayi-wu
       say no           3SG-AUX-PST          1SGDAT            food-DAT
       'He refused me food' [said no to me about food].
  An overt nominal agent of nginngin bu- or na- could be Ergative-marked, but might
also be Absolutive (textual examples of both kinds exist). Similarly, many actions which
may be performed with respect to a complement require that it be Dative:(36)   wiyl             ya-0-yana          nganu
       whistle          3-3SG-AUX          1SGDAT
       'He's whistling at me'.(37)   lirrngang-ma      ya-0-yu           nganu         nga-we-ny-ga                 yum-ba

       galul-wa
       up-ABL
       'He's laughing at me having fallen down from the tree'.
  The usual form of construction in Wardaman is for Dative-marked nominal
complement to also be marked by independent Dative pronoun, and the latter in fact often
precedes the former in the clause. The nominal establishing identity of the Dative-
complement often occurs at some remove from the Dative pronoun, forming an
absolutely typical kind of loose linkage within the clause.(38)   menyje           go                 gawalya-wu

       'You shouldn't call out to/for the child'.
  Dative marks the complements of certain formally mediopassive verbs, the latter status
indicated by stem-formative -yi-, identical to the reflexive-reciprocal marker, but in these
verbs, not identifiable as such.(42)   nga-geng-mi-yi-n               lin-gu
       ISG-fear-MED-PRES             snake-DAT
       'I'm frightened of snakes' [or frightened of the snake].
  The above contrasts with predicate geng-ma- 'fear', which determines transitive clause
structure.(43)   nga-wali-yi-n                         nganinggin-gu              yi-marnany-gu
       ISG-jealous-MED-PRES                  mine GEN-DAT               YI-husband-DAT
       'I'm jealous of my husband'.
  While wali-yi-, as (43) shows, occurs with Dative complement expressing person
concerning whom one's jealousy is aroused, there is a contrasting verb wali-na- (with
inseparable auxiliary na-, otherwise 'to see') which occurs in transitive clauses with the
person causing one to be jealous (rather than the one with respect to whom one is jealous)
treated as direct object.
  Dative also marks the nominal complement in purposive clauses (see 11.4.).
  Possessive phrases in Wardaman have a typical structure in which the possessor if
nominal is Dative-marked, if pronominal is expressed by the appropriate independent
Genitive pronoun; and the possessor, whether nominal or pronominal, is also marked by
a form of the Dative independent pronoun agreeing with nominal or pronominal
possessor. Ordering of these constituents is not strict: the Dative-marked nominal, for
example, may occur before or after the agreeing Dative pronoun (see further 10.4.). A
considerable number of examples, culled from texts, illustrating mainly nominal but also
pronominal possessors, is given. These are fairly similar in content and are chosen to
show, among other things, various ordering possibilities.

  Note as in (51) the resumptive Dative pronoun (nganu) may be omitted from a clause
such as this, in which the possessive phrase functions as direct object.
  To express possession of a possessor, both possessors are Dative-marked (and there
may be independent Dative pronoun, especially agreeing with nominal possessor):

       'That old man, my father's father, came ...'.
  In (54), the narrator explains a relationship by genealogical steps for which, of course,
a separate term (gagung) exists.
  A Dative-marked nominal or pronominal possessor cannot be further inflected for
function within the clause; that is, the possessor noun cannot be inflected to show
agreement with the function of the possessed noun.(55)   nganinggin-gu              yi-guyu-wu            minini-yi       nga(n)-la-rri

       'My mother's dog bit me'.
  That is, the double possessor construction ""my mother's"" cannot be Ergative-marked
to agree with the possessed noun, ""dog"".
  Examples of possessive constructions which involve some other kinds of possessed
nominals (besides kin) are:(56)   wu-den           go            gumurrinji-wu           wudu           0-yanja

       'He didn't know the white man's language at all, he shook his head'.
  It can now be seen that the expression of possession is rather similar to the typical
Dative complement, in that the favoured construction for both is one in which the nominal
complement/possessor occurs in construction with independent Dative pronoun (and
also, pronominal possessor may occur in construction with independent Dative pronoun).
As one further example, note the occurrence of gunga in the following:
                                                    Nominal classes, inflection and derivation 75

       Ί helped out [Kr. 'take partner la', as in fight] my aunt and also I helped out
       my mother'.
  In both clauses gunga comes before Dative-marked nominal.
  Given that possessive phrases and Dative complements both exhibit the favoured
structure with independent pronoun and Dative-marked nominal, it is sometimes difficult
to insist on a clear difference between structural descriptions of clauses as ones in which
the Dative pronoun is a complement (generally, semantic beneficiary) of the verb, versus
those in which it is part of the possessor phrase. Examples (59) and (60) illustrate the
structural overlap:(59)   nga-gard-bu-n              gunga               nguwun              wurre-wu
       ISG-wipe-PRES              3SGDAT             faeces-ABS           child-DAT

       'You [PL] make the old woman's bed for her' [you make a bed for the old
       woman].
  Finally, Dative is used to mark ""number of times"" with the numbers guyamin 'two' and
murrgun 'three': guyamin-gu 'twice', and murrgun-gu 'thrice'. There is no exactly
analogous form with the number lege One'. Instead, Once, one time' is often expressed
by the adverb dijbi, but there is also a form legegumin used in this meaning. (See 7.6.6.
for -min). A related form legegun is used to mean Once, once in a while, sporadically,
from time to time' (7.6.5.).","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"

1.3. Linguistic typeWardaman is both prefixing and suffixing. It has relatively complex nominal and verbal
morphology. There are three overt nominal class markers (yi-, ma- and WM-), at least the
first two of which are used to designate fairly unified sets of denotata. Most noun stems
occur only with prefix of one particular class (e.g., yi-biyan 'man, person, Aborigine');
but some may occur with more than one, producing lexical difference (yi-mum 'eye',
wu-mum 'nipple'). As well, there are many nouns which occur without prefix (i.e., with
0- prefix), but with which modifiers (adjectival nouns) may exhibit overt concord.
  Number and case are marked by suffixes, and the syntactic case system tends to be
fairly strongly Ergative-Absolutive. However, there is wide use of a clause type with
actor subject (not generally Ergatively-marked if represented by an independent
nominal), and objective complement marked by Dative case. As well, there are various
one-place (fully intransitive) clause types. Overt suffix categories include
Ergative/Instrumental, Dative/ Genitive, local cases Allative, Locative and Ablative, and
the semantically most restricted local category, Originative. In addition, there are two
morphologically composite case categories, historically built on the Dative. The first,
an historical composite of Dative plus Locative, is termed Dissociative, and usually
expresses the meaning ""from"" or ""away from"" of an animate participant, or ""on account
of of a wider range of participant types. The second, historical composite of Dative and
Ablative, expresses a range of notions including source and cause, and is labelled Source.
  Participants are obligatorily marked by pronominal prefixes in the verb, and
secondarily by independent pronouns. A maximum of two participants are indicated in
the verb by transitive prefix forms that tend to be portmanteaux, i.e., not neatly
segmentable into parts representing each person/number that enters into the combination.
  In the expression of verbal meanings, there is a basic distinction between inflecting
verbs and what I have called free verb ""particles"". It is common in linguistic descriptions
for the word ""particle"" to be used to designate non-inflecting parts of speech. In
Wardaman what I call ""particles"" can take some inflections. The term ""particle"" in this
sense, however, has had currency in Australianist studies for some time (see Dixon ed.
1976), and I retain it, but place emphasis on describing the possibilities of inflection, and
the important syntactic functions of these elements. ""Verb particles"" are semantically
full, and occur in combination with a small number of high-frequency inflecting roots
(including a number of significant ones of shape CV). Where such particle and verb
combinations are highly regular in a specific verbal meaning, the construction is
generally labelled that of Particle plus Auxiliary in this description. However, it is
                                                                               Introduction 5
significant that here, seemingly more than in some other regional languages which have
this general construction type (e.g., Mangarrayi), the ""AUX"" often transparently has
some clear semantic commonality with the particle, and thus cannot be regarded simply
as a formal mechanism or bearer of inflections. For example, with the particle gayardung
'run', most common are the motion verbs ya- 'go' and nyanga- 'come'. These of course
partly function as grammatical ""auxiliaries"", in that they bear person and verbal
categorial inflections; but transparently, they are semantically integral with the particle.
The clear kind of semantic integration in this case contrasts with that, say, between the
particle wululu and its usual ""AUX"" we-, which may occur by itself in the meaning 'fall,
be born'. However, together, the combination wululu we- means 'enter, go inside' (not
""fall in"" or the like). That is, there is no clear semantic ""transparency"" of the AUX in
the latter case, and thus a greater idiomaticity to the combination than to those with
gayardung. Thus, the label Particle plus AUX is applied to combinations which may
differ considerably in their internal semantic relations. The diverse nature of
combinations within this construction type is clearly of comparative interest, and this
labelling should not by any means disguise the fact that, as noted above, ""AUX"" is a
semantically and functionally flexible, diverse and problematic category.
  Particles have a wide syntactic range. They may be inflected for nominal categories
(case), and occur in non-predicative construction types as nominals, and as modifiers.
Paradigms of inflecting verbs tend to be highly regular: there is a very limited amount
of suffixal allomorphy for tense/aspect/mood categories. The one thoroughly irregular
paradigm is that of the verb ""to go"".
  Suffixal categories of the verb include Present, Past, Future, and Potential, that is,
express tense and in some instances, tense/mood meanings. An Admonitive (""lest"")
construction is generally built on a zero-stem form, or is built on the Future stem in the
few verbs where this is a formally distinct (and obviously historically moribund)
category. Further tense/aspect meanings (e.g., iterative) are expressed by additional
suffixation to verb forms inflected for tense/aspect, and in some instances (Habitual) by
special prefix forms.
  A basic mood distinction between Realis and Irrealis categories is expressed by verbal
prefixation, in combination (in some instances) with differences in the bound pronominal
forms which express person/number as between the two mood categories.
  Weak subordination of one predication to another is a common means of constructing
discourse linkage in Wardaman. There are two sets of subordinators, one expressing
non-past, the other past, temporal reference. Another important mechanism of textual
cohesion is ""de-focusing"" of overtly occurring NPs, i.e., marking of them as recoverable
and thus cohesive with surrounding linguistic context.
  Three deictic ""degrees"" are distinguished in the demonstrative system, with some
irregularity in the paradigms. The spatially intermediate category (not ""this""and not
""yonder"", but proximate ""that"") also serves to indicate textual recoverability, and is thus
most closely comparable to the English definite article.
  There are five main points of articulation of parallel stop-nasal series: labial, apico-
alveolar, apico-domal or retroflex, lamino-palatal, and velar. There are laterals at three
of these points of articulation, apico-alveolar, apico-domal, and lamino-palatal. The
6 Chapter 1 lamino-palatal lateral has a very limited distribution. There are retroflex glide and tap
 alveolar rhotics. While there are five vowels /, e, u, o and a, the mid-vowels do not
 occur in any of the inflectional morphology, except as the result of low-level assimilatory
processes. The mid-vowels do, however, occur in a small number of important
derivational morphemes, and they occur freely in the wider lexicon.
   There are no vowel clusters in Wardaman, and no vowel-initial morphemes besides the
 tag-question particle ale 'isn't that so?'.
   There appears to be little intra-language variation, but minor differences in a few lexical
items were noted among speakers.
   Like Warlmanpa to the south (see Nash 1990), Wardaman speak of different territorial
sub-groupings, to which recruitment is normatively in the male line, as having different
madin 'languages', or 'words'. Each such identifiable grouping is said to have
minimally one, sometimes more, special words that are ""their"" language. Typically, these
are said to be either the sound made by, or the language spoken by, principal mythological
figures saliently associated with given Wardaman sub-territories. For example, an
important mythological association with the sub-country just west of Willeroo Station
homestead running westerly to Garnawala (Mount Hogarth) is gulirrida 'peewees',
which are abundantly represented in some of the spectacular rock paintings in this area.
The ""language"" or ""word"" of the peewees, and therefore of the grouping of people
patrifiliated to this area, is said to be mamundajgani, a form for which no etymology can
be given. A few of the ""words"" for particular sub-groupings may have etymologies in
other languages of the Victoria River area. At least one is clearly onomatopoetic (e.g.,
standardization of a bird cry). Knowledge of this kind of relation among people, territory
and salient ""word"" or ""words"" is limited to older people. The madin 'words' about which
there appeared to be wide agreement were: mamundajgani, cited above; ngagandoroj,
the ""word'Of menngen 'white cockatoo', a major dreaming around the Innesvale Station
homestead area; yidabu and wamanga, words associated with warrija 'crocodile'
dreaming, localized at Mt. Gregory; and nenene, a ""word' (imitative of a bird cry) of
bulyan 'eagle', associated with Jalad, or Price's Creek, area. The words associated with
""crocodile"" are interesting, and either have etymologies in other Victoria River
languages, or apparently in any case connote the meanings ""beef, meat"" and ""hit, strike""
(Wardaman deb 'hit, belt' was used to gloss wamanga), both principal elements of the
myth associated with Mt. Gregory, the principal characters of which, Warrura and
Barnangga, fought over a catch of crocodile. In addition, a dilygun 'possum' dreaming
associated with the high country along Mathison Creek is characterized by a particular
style of speaking, with stopped nasal segments similar to the speech of a person trying
to talk with a blocked nose. Thus, possum says dadadi instead of danani 'this one'.
Asked about these ""languages"" or ""words"", people will emphasize that they are all ""one"",
the ""same Wardaman"", that is, are socio-territorial distinctions made by people who share
a common language in the linguist's usual sense.
   Among other systems of social relationship, Wardaman people recognize several
(equatable) sets of subsection (or ""eight-class"") terms, but identify only one of these as
""proper"" Wardaman. That set is given in 5.13. They also recognize matrifiliatively
transmitted recruitment to groupings commonly called ngurlu across the Victoria River
                                                                                   Introduction 7
region. These groupings are not localized. Among my Wardaman informants, most
belonged to one or other of the ngurlu: goyin 'sugarbag', ganben 'flying fox', warrag
'catfish', yiburu 'black rain', and yiwaganga 'rain'. While some of these are specifically
Wardaman words (e.g., goyin), certain of the names (e.g., yiburu) have wider currency
across the region, and cannot be considered only Wardaman.","[28, 29, 30, 31]"

10.9. Variant ordering in DEM + N phrasesIn 10.3 it was said that the most common ordering of demonstrative and specified noun
is DEM + N. It was also noted that such phrases containing the forms of the Proximate
demonstrative nana are of particularly high frequency, since that category has the
function of signaling the textual recoverability of the entity, and is perhaps most
comparable to the English definite article (see 7.2. for illustration). But recoverability in
general does not completely coincide with the identification in context of which
particular recoverable entity is being referred to. Let us consider some instances of the
variant order with the Proximate category, N + DEM, since it would appear to be
associated with and one of the means of clarifying which recoverable or given noun
phrase within the information unit is meant, by signalling a break in the flow.
  In certain instances where two protagonists have been spoken about, the variant order
seems to be associated with a shift from one to the other.
  In the Onion text, line 65 we have an instance of marluga nana. Two men have been
discussing the illness of one of them who ate food prepared by two girls. The other man
suggests to him that he has been ensorcelled, and he agrees. ""I dreamt about them"" (63),
""about the two of them giving me onion, he says"" (64). At that point the other old man
calls out to the girls and tells them to rub the victim with fat. It is at that point in line
(65) that the phrase in question occurs, and appears to be associated with a transition
from the speaker quoting the victim, to the other old man asserting his authority over the
girls and telling them to cure him. Note that the ""other"" old man re-introduced at this
point is grammatically the subject of an intransitive verb (""call to"") which takes dative
complement.
  In the text Mejern, between lines (93) and (98) there is a similar shift in transition
between two recoverable characters. An old Aboriginal man identified as the father of
246 Chapter 10Micky Bennett was hiding along the river (92) and saw a white man shooting Aborigines
(93). For several dozen lines the speaker has been talking about shooting by whites, not
individually identifiable but only known as associated with local stations. A chief interest
of this part of the story is the identifiability of particular Aborigines and their exploits in
the face of European violence. Having seen the white (or whites) shooting (93), the old
Aboriginal man spears his horse out from under him (94-97), and he falls. Line (98)
begins with the variant order memden nana, perhaps associated with the transition from
the previous few lines in which the old Aboriginal man is the assumed agent (ellipsed in
97). A similar shift occurs between about lines (99) and (104). In (99), the old Aborigine
runs up to the white and stabs him, ""with a tommyhawk"" (100), ""stab"" (101), and runs
away up on top (of the hills) (102-103). Line 104 says: mernden nana gud gajurri 'the
white man stood up'. That is, both are recoverable as nana signals, but I hypothesize that
the variant order may be associated with the signalling of a shift among recoverable items,
specifically to one that has receded slightly into the narrative background.","[269, 270]"

4.2. Nominals: Pronouns, nouns, demonstratives, and
     interrogatives""Nominal"" is the cover term used for a broad class of lexical items which can inflect for
case and certain other categories. Within the class of nominals, several sub-classes will
be identified. The syntactic patterning of all sub-classes tends to be Ergative-Absolutive
where there is an object marked on the verb (even if 3SG zero), but occasional instances
are found in text in which transitive agent nominals are not Ergative-marked.
  Pronouns are those nominals which refer to speech-situation participants, and some
which can index (emphatically, anaphorically) other nominals. There are many formal
similarities between the independent pronominal stems, and the affixal pronominal forms
obligatorily prefixed to the verb to indicate participant identities.
  Demonstrative pronouns are a nominal sub-class which make reference in terms of
graded distance or location categories calibrated primarily in relation to the speech
situation (there are three such degrees marked by Wardaman demonstrative morphology,
and a whole host of formally related terms, ""this side"", ""that side"", etc.). One term in the
three-term spatial system, called Proximate, also serves to indicate textual recoverability.
Its forms are thus far more frequent than are those of the other two demonstrative
categories.
  Interrogative pronouns are nominals with which different kinds of questions are
formed: ""what"", ""where"", ""who"". Secondarily, they function in the construction of
negative and indefinite arguments (""nobody"", ""somebody"").
  Number words belong to the class of nominals. There are three numbers, lege One',
guyamin 'two', and murrgun 'three'. Beyond that ngawurnen indicates 'many, a large
number'. Number words may function as modifiers, or as noun phrase heads in their own
right.
  Finally, there is a large class that will simply be called ""nominals"" in general, but which
comprehends what would be called ""nouns"" and ""adjectives"" in conventional part-of-
58 Chapter 4 speech terms. In dictionary entries and glosses, for the most part a distinction has been
 made between the former (""N"") and the latter (""NADJ"")· This is not because the
 distinction can be satisfactorily sustained for all purposes (see below), but because it
 partly captures some distributional and functional differences within the class.
   Some nominals, the notionally more adjectival ones like ""empty"", ""tough"", ""raw""
 ""crooked"", ""long"", ""good"" and so on, are more likely to function predicatively than are
 what might be called argument nominals such as ""goanna"" (lizard),""woman"", and ""duly
 bag"" (string bag). The more adjectival are regularly causativized and inchoativized,
 while the argument nominals are not regularly so treated. Here, however, the distinction
 is not absolute, for some of them which might be considered towards the attributive end
 of a nominal-feature spectrum, and also some which designate persons in terms of age-
 statuses, for example, are found to be so treated. For example, a noun which typically
occurs as argument, meaning such things as ""plain, flat place"" (as opposed to ""flat"" in
general), may be causativized. A noun such as ""man"" may, also. Finally, the more
adjectival are commonly found in modifying function, while the others are not.
   While a degree of distinctiveness thus can be identified between notionally adjectival
and other nominals, in Wardaman as in many other Australian languages (and regional
ones, including Wardaman's putative congeners, see Cook 1987: 88), the formerare not
limited to predicative and modifying functions, but also regularly function as arguments.
In Wardaman, their functioning as arguments is implemented with the help of the overt
nominal class markers which are prefixed to nominals of the adjectival sort, and create
forms the general kind of reference of which is indicated by the class marker, and the
more specific denotation of which is understood in terms of the ""property-like""
designation of the adjectival stem. Such forms may function syntactically as modifiers,
but equally, they may function as arguments in their own right. The difference between
the two different notional types is fluid enough so that stems of the more adjectival kind,
class-prefixed, may come to be regular designators of (kinds of) referents which have
the particular property. For example, the adjectival stem barnbamin means 'naked,
hairless'; with animate class prefix, the formyi-barnbarnin is used to mean 'buffalo'. To
give a second example, the adjectival stem langman means 'clear, cleared'; with class
prefix, the form wu-langman is taken to mean 'clear space, clear area', and case-inflected
forms of it are commonly used without any (other) argument noun, e.g., wu-langma-warr
'to a clearing, clear place' (allative-marked).
   Another general difference between notionally ""argument"" and adjectival nominals is
that most of the former tend to regularly occur with only one class prefix (if any, for there
are argument nouns like bangbun 'woman' which never take overt class prefix). For
example, most body parts take the class prefix yi-, and tend to occur only with that prefix,
not with any other. On the other hand, most of the notionally adjectival nominals may
be freely prefixed with the range of class markers, something which changes their
understood designation. There are some indeterminacies here too, however (see 5.1. for
more detail), so relatively fixed versus variable class-marking of nominals can only be
taken as a general guide. The point in distinguishing between N and NADJ at all is not
to saddle the language with untenable distinctions, but rather to try to capture some of
the privilege-of-occurrence tendencies which are evident in Wardaman.
                                                                            Word classes 59
43. Finite verbsVerbs obligatorily are marked for either subject alone, or for subject and object. A
maximum of two participant slots can be filled by pronominal prefixes. Other participant
roles are marked on external nominals but nowhere on the verb. Categories of tense,
mood and aspect are marked on the verb in the main by suffixation, but also (primarily
in respect of a mood distinction between realis and irrealis) by prefixes. Weak
subordination and other kinds of clause-level relations are expressed by suffixation to
finite verb forms.
  Wardaman has at least 130 fairly common finite verbs (unlike Wakiman, which appears
to have only around forty, Cook 1987: 90). Among these are eight very high-frequency
CV verbs, a number of which can also occur as inseparable auxiliaries of compound verb
stems, e.g., bu- occurs as a verb in its own right meaning 'hit', but also as auxiliary in
banybu- 'to fill receptacle', dembu- 'to peck', werrenybu- 'to ensorcell', gardbu- 'to
wipe', and so on. Several classes of such ""compound verbs"" can be identified according
to the verb root. There are also many finite verbs which have a simple, i.e., non-
compound, stem, e.g., bewe- 'to tread on', gorno- 'to fill', gene- 'to taste', and others.
Most finite verbs can occur with one or more ""verb particles"" to yield particular
meanings, while some finite verbs occur independently with full lexical meaning e.g.,
waja- means 'to leave', and is often used without particle; but may occur with particles
to create other meanings, such as narru waja- 'to dodge (weapons)'.","[81, 82, 83]"
"8.17. TransitivityThere is a clear difference between canonical transitive and intransitive clause structures
in Wardaman, the former characterized by the presence of two pronominal adjuncts in
the verb, and by the subject pronominal corresponding to an independent Ergative-
marked, semantically agentive nominal; the latter, by the presence of one pronominal
adjunct.
                                                                 Categories of the finite verb 203  However, a bipartite transitive-intransitive division of both clauses and verbs is
unsatisfactory. Let us consider clause types first, and here it becomes apparent that it is
useful to recognize at least three major ones, and at least one minor one.
  An intransitive clause may be defined as one with one pronominal verb prefix (Table
16, Type 1). Various kinds of complements may occur in the intransitive clause, none of
which is marked in the verb, e.g., a clause with predicate of motion may have a
Dissociative nominal complement, 0-yanggi gunya ' he went away from him', a location
complement of some kind, and so on.
  The canonical transitive clause is one in which there are two pronominal adjuncts, one
of which may be linked to an independent Ergative-marked nominal (that is, if this is
present), while the other represents the direct object category (Type 3). There is a
ditransitive clause type, which only a few predicates may realize, in which the two
pronominal adjuncts represent the semantic agent and the semantic indirect object (Type
4).
Table 16. Types of Noun-Verb Relations                   Noun                                  Verb
1                  ABSi                                  SUBJj
2                  ABSi+ DATj                            SUBJi

4                  ABSj+ ERGj+ DATk                      SUBj + OBJk   This leaves the question of how one may regard the common Absolutive-Dative clause
Type 2 in Wardaman, i.e., that in which there is one pronominal adjunct to the verb, a
semantic agent, and a Dative (often, semantically benefactive) clausal argument function
which cannot be encoded on the verb, but may be expressed by independent nominal
phrase, commonly a pronominal. If one takes the presence of verbal pronominal prefixes
as definitional, this clause type is to be regarded as intransitive. But if one defines the
clause type in terms of predicate semantics and argument roles, such a clause-type would
better be regarded as two-place, rather than one-place (intransitive) with possible
additional complements. The agent nominal, if present in such clauses, is over-
whelmingly Absolutive, although it may occasionally be Ergative-marked
  One might also recognize as a distinct sub-type the clause with one pronominal adjunct
which is a semantic agent or experiencer, in which there may be an Instrumental phrase
expressing the semantic cause or source. The archetypal predicate which occurs in this
clause type in Wardaman is ba- 'bum, perish', often with Instrumental niarninggam-yi
'sun'. As with other intransitives, there is an optional purposive (formally Dative)
argument position ""for which"" that may occur with this predicate, e.g., nga-ba-n wiya-wu
'I'm thirsty for water'. But the really distinctive things about this clause type are, first,
the presence of the semantically agentive nominal phrase which cannot be marked on
the verb, but instead is realized as Instrument; and the encoding of the sole semantically
patientive nominal by subject form-class in the verb.
  It seems out of keeping with the structural diversity of clause types, then, to simply
recognize a distinction between transitive and intransitive clauses. We may more
204 Chapter 8usefully recognize (at least) the types shown in Table 16. Some further minor types may
also be identified on both semantic and formal grounds; e.g., that described in the
preceding paragraph; the mediopassive construction; and as will be seen below, a
construction type might be recognized for which a label ""medioactive"" might be coined,
to handle the case of a some predicate (particle plus verb) phrases which mainly designate
weather conditions.
  If it is not useful to recognize a simple bipartite division of clauses, it is also not
completely satisfactory to recognize a bipartite division of verbs, for at least two reasons.
The first is that the transitivity value of finite verbs as sole predicate constituent, and as
member of a particle plus verb construction, may be and often is different. There is a
large number of particle plus verb combinations, in which the finite verbs are the same
ones that generally occur elsewhere as predicates of transitive clauses. With some
particles, however, they do not determine transitive clause structure. For example, the
finite verb gi-, by itself, is transitive, or the predicate basis of transitive clauses. With
the particle mllid 'show', however, it takes only one pronominal adjunct, and any indirect
object, ""person shown to"", is a Dative-marked nominal which cannot be encoded in the
verb; thus its argument structure is of the Absolutive-Dative kind. In combination with
other particles, such as denberr 'hang up, suspend', gi- is the basis of transitive clause
structure.
  In the same way the verb root bu- may occur in transitive and other clause types
depending upon its occurrence as sole predicate, versus its particular lexical combination
with given particles. Although bu- as sole verbal constituent is transitive, in the particle
plus verb combinationyMrd^a) bu- 'to show to' it occurs in the Absolutive-Dative clause
type, and any ""person shown to"" must be Dative-marked outside the verb.
  The root bu- is particularly common in particle plus verb combinations which designate
weather conditions, and clauses of this kind show no evidence of being structurally
transitive. For example, in clauses with the particle plus verb combinations jurrg(ba)
bu- 'sprinkle, rain lightly', and larrawardba bu- 'to break' (of day), there is no syntactic
indication of transitivity:(482)   galulul ya-0-wudba            marlnga          jurrg-ba     ya-0-bu-n-ga
        toprdp 3-3SG-throw           cloud-ABS         sprinkle     3-3SG-AUX-PRES-SUB
        'Way high up clouds form when it sprinkles'.
  There has never been found to be an explicitly agentive nominal which may occur with
this combination, although the ""cognate"" nominal wiyan 'rain', in Absolutive form, may
co-occur.(483)   larraward-ba        ya-0-bu-n                  maminggani
        break-PS            3-3SG-AUX-PRES             sun-ABS
        'The day is breaking'.
  The Absolutive form of ""sun"" in propositions with this combination may be taken as
an indication that it is formally intransitive (i.e., one-place). It might, as suggested above,
be useful to recognize this as a distinct predicate class, for bu- otherwise typically occurs
                                                                   Categories of the finite verb 205
in transitive or Absolutive-Dative clause types. Combinations of bu- with other particles,
such as bag 'break', yield transitive clause structures.
  Likewise, the verb na- 'see' is ordinarily transitive (ngawun-da-n Ί see them'), but
occurs in a formally intransitive clause structure with the particle lag(ba), meaning as a
whole 'to dry up, become dessicated'; in this combination, it is partly synonymous with
the combination lag(ba) ngegba- 'to die and dry up', where ngegba- normally, as sole
predicative constituent, occurs in intransitive clause structure.
  The second kind of evidence that militates against a strict transitive-intransitive
distinction at the level of the predicate is the fact that one important predicate, yana- 'say,
do' is found used both transitively and intransitively. Clauses with this predicate tend to
be structured transitively first, where there is a jussive complement of ""commanding
that"" (see 477 above), or second, of ""saying to that"" with complement clause not one of
directly reported speech, in which case the person told may be treated as direct object:(484)   ngan-yana-rri              ya-0-nyangi-we                yiwarna         wiyan
        3SG/lSG-say-PST            3-3SG-come-FUT                next            rain
        'She told me she will come next year'.
  Note that this amounts to the possibility of ""indirect"" report, i.e., the report is not framed
as direct speech, but rather as a summary of what was said, or as indirect speech.
Transitive usage of the verb also is common where what is said is a nominal ""cognate
object"" of speech of some kind, and not necessarily a complement clause:(485) nganburr-yana-rri-ya                    madin
      3NSG/lSG-say-PST-NAR                    word-ABS
        'They gave me knowledge', in the sense 'they imparted information'.
 Intransitive usage tends to correspond to the function ""tell to"", ""say to"" or ""relate to"",
where the complement is a clause of reported (direct) speech:(486) dana-ni-wan         0-yana-rri          nganu
      this-ART-DF         3SG-say-PST         1SG-DAT
        ""This is the one"", she said to me'.
  The same possibility of variable transitivity exists with the particle plus verb
combination yang(ma) bu- 'tell, inform'. Ί informed them' may be either yang
nga-bu-ndi wurrugu or yang ngawun-bu-ndi, and either may have a full linked clause
(either independent or subordinate in form) specifying the content of the report. Textual
examples were recorded in which the particle jurd-(ba) 'show, indicate', which normally
occurs with finite verb bu- in Absolutive-Dative clause-type such that any ""person shown
to"" must be put into Dative case, alternatively occurs with constructionally transitive
yana-, as indicated by the fact that the one to whom something is shown is marked by
object pronominal form in the verb. (For a parallel difference in transitivity of the ""say""
verb in Wakiman, see Cook 1987: 221.)
206 Chapter 8   Given the evidence presented here of the inadequacy of a bipartite transitive-
intransitive distinction at either clause- or predicate-level, we nevertheless capture
something significant about the language by noting that there tends to be congruence
between particular verbs as sole predicative constituent and particular clause types, i.e.,
bu- as sole predicate normally occurs in transitive clauses. Further, predicates which as
sole constituent function transitively also, in combination with particles, commonly
occur in Absolutive-Dative clause structures; but predicates which function intransitively
as sole verbal constituent also tend to function intransitively in combination with
particles.
  There is no single process of transitive-intransitive derivation (but see 8.19. on
causatives). Rather the difference between transitive and intransitive predicate meanings
and associated clause structures is generally managed ""lexico-syntactically"", by the
alternation of different finite (auxiliary) verbs with the same particle. Hence, the
difference implemented by such alternation is often not simply a grammatical one relating
to transitivity, but may also involve additional elements of lexical semantics. Below are
listed a number of common alternations of the same particle with different finite verbs,
the difference instantiating the difference between transitive and intransitive clause
structures:

  This list shows that a common transitive-intransitive pairing is gi-ljingi-, but other
pairings are found As independent predicate gi- means 'put', and jingi- 'sit', but the
latter also has an important copula function (""be, be in a place""), as well as auxiliary
function with particles.
  The sense of some of the pairs listed may be more or less transparent. In some cases
the pair corresponds to a difference in transitivity in clause type, but seemingly without
great semantic difference, e.g., mamaj ngen-me-n 'he beckons me', versus mamaj
ya-0-yana nganu 'he beckons to me', or the like.
  The difference in pairings with wabirl is that between ""peel"" or ""take the skin off,
versus ""come, peel off, fade, fall off, as one might say of paint on the wall or colour in
clothing.
  There are many alternative possible pairings where there is no change in transitivity of
the clause, but rather a semantic difference in the nature of the action predicated. In
Wardaman, this kind of alternation cannot be seen as of formally different kind to the
transitive-intransitive pairings shown above. Some of these alternative pairings give
some insight into verbal lexical semantics. Examples are:

compositional, e.g., lag ngegba- 'to die and dry up'; or luglug-ba ba- 'to swell up and
burn'; mun-ma ba- 'to cook in a ground oven, pit'.
208 Chapter 8  From some alternative pairings with me-, it becomes clear that this verb has a central
semantic component in many combinations of ""action by hand"", e.g., dibdib me- 'to
extract, remove' versus dibdib buju- 'to extract, dig out'; birrij bu- 'knead' versus me-
'stir', where the latter is an action more fully implemented with the hand only. It also is
clear that the verbja/α- which by itself is used to mean 'to boomerang', in combinations
expresses a component of meaning ""touch tangentially"", e.g., din.gawurrg bu- 'to hit on
the neck', versus din.gawurrg jala- 'to hit a (glancing) blow on the neck'.","[226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232]"

8.11. Reflexive-reciprocalThe reflexive-reciprocal suffix, which immediately follows the bare stem and thus always
occurs following a vowel, is -vi-. If the final stem-vowel is a, presence of the reflexive-
reciprocal marker results in the assimilation of that vowel to i. Thus, the reflexive-
reciprocal stem of the transitive verb luma- 'cut' is lumi-yi-, while that of warrang-ma-
'to swear at', is \varrang-mi-yi-:
190 Chapter 8(436)   yawurr-warrang-mi-yi-n
        3-3NSG-swear at-RR-PRES
        'They're cursing each other'.
  The reflexive-reciprocal is used to express action where subject and object are identical,
including action upon oneself, and in this is similar to certain uses of the English
reflexive-reciprocal category. However, typically action of certain (largely negatively
evaluated?) kinds, such as fighting and swearing, are formulated with use of an ordinary
predicate made reflexive-reciprocal. Thus, for example, the typical way of saying that
people are fighting is to say, ya-wurr-bu-yi-n, literally 'they are hitting each other'. A
further example of this kind is the formally reflexive-reciprocal verb nge-yi- 'argue',
from transitive nge- 'call'. It seems that the meanings of these verbs should not be taken
too literally (e.g., as ""hit each other"", ""call each other""), but should rather be seen as a
kind of grammatical metaphor, or a typical way of formulating certain kinds of action.
The sentence ngamanda-wunya ya-wurr-nge-yi-n is approximately the equivalent of
English ""What are they arguing about?"", rather than the more literal ""What are they
calling each other (for)?"" A few textual examples of the reflexive-reciprocal category
follow:(437)   ngabulu-wan                 0-ginye-yi-rri              gunga
        breast-ABS-DF               3SG-cook-RR-PST             3SG-DAT
        'And she cooked her breasts for him ...'
  (437) refers to the customary practice of warming one's breasts in the heat of a fire in
order to begin and enhance milk-flow. Note that there is an independent Absolutive
nominal object in a part- whole relation to the subject of the predicate.(438)   ngabulu          jHyjiyl               0-me-yi-rri                jabalawarna-ya
        breast-ABS        squeeze              3SG-AUX-RR-PST        flat    rock-LOC
        'She expressed her milk onto the flat rock'.
  Here again, the ""breast"" which is part of the whole pronominal adjunct is treated as
Absolutive object, with reflexive-reciprocal expression of the action-on-self in the
predicate.(439)   wurr-ngu-ndi-wuya           girdibun    nan-ba-wan      wurr-bu-yi-rri-wuya
        3NSG-eat-PST-DU             finish      that-ABL-DF     3NSG-hit-RR-PST-DU
        'The two of them ate it all up and then they fought'.
  Following reflexive-reciprocal marking, Future tense-marking always has the shape
-ngbe; or, differently stated, the reflexive-reciprocal and Future together have the shape
-yi-ngbe:(440)   ya-wurr-bu-yingbe
        3-3NSG-hit-RR PUT
        'They are going to fight' .

  Reflexive-reciprocal forms of the verbs na- 'see' and bu- 'hit' have an important role
as auxiliaries in inchoative constructions; see 8.18.","[213, 214, 215]"

6.2. Independent pronouns: Base formsIn Wardaman, as in Wakiman (Cook 1987, Chapter 5), a basic distinction is to be made
between what may be called ""base"" and ""general oblique"" (6.3.) free pronominal
categories. ""Base"" forms are the foundational forms of two case categories in free
pronouns. With zero inflection to the base, they fill Absolutive case-functions; that is,
they serve in intransitive subject and transitive object functions within the clause, in
conjunction with the obligatory pronominal prefixes which mark these categories in the
verb. With Ergative inflection, base forms fill transitive subject function within the
clause, in conjunction with the pronominal prefixes marking this function. Thus two case
categories, Absolutive and Ergative, that from the point of view of case-marking in the
noun serve quite different functions, from the perspective of (historical) pronominal
morphology differ principally by outer inflection. A plausible historical inference may
be that the distinction between Absolutive and Ergative categories in the free pronouns
on the base pronominal series may be a relatively recent development.
  In the base pronouns and elsewhere in the person-marking system, there is no formal
distinction between dual and plural in the person categories lEX(clusive), and 2NSG
(nonsingular); there is a single form which may optionally be dual-suffixed (see 5.6.2.)
in order to make a distinction between dual and plural, but this is morphologically
secondary. In addition, there is generally no formal distinction between dual and plural
in third person categories of all kinds (i.e., neither in demonstratives, nor in the
pronominal prefixes in the verb).
  Though there are thus simply 'nonsingular' pronominal base forms in 1EX, 2NSG and
3NSG categories, there are also to be distinguished first and second person singular base
forms, a 1 Dual category, and a 1 Inclusive Nonsingular category. Leaving aside third
person forms entirely for the moment, the base pronominal forms in 1 and 2 person
categories are:
108 Chapter 6
                Singular             Dual                Nonsingular
1                ngayngii         yawimg-guya            ngarrug
1EX                —                  —                  yirrug(guya)
2               yinyang                                  nur rug (guy a)
  1SG is ngoyugu, 2SGyinyang. Clearly the notion of ""inclusion"" does not apply to
1SG, but only to forms that signal 1SG + 2. There are three nonsingular categories that
all belong to one form class in the sense that they all exhibit a final syllable -rrug, where
the rr (based on this, and evidence from the pronominal prefixes in the verb) is clearly
to be taken as a nonsingular element. However, ngarrug has a different status from the
other two in that it is inherently more than dual, and cannot be suffixed for dual number.
It contrasts with UN DU yawung-guya, which (based on evidence from the general
oblique or Dative form) appears to have a stemyawu- with epenthetic nasal before the
dual suffix. The forms 1EXNSG yirrug and 2NSG nitrrug may optionally be
dual-suffixed to explicitly indicate dual number, for as noted there is no difference
between dual and plural categories in 1EX, 2NSG and 3NSG pronominals in the verb.
1EXNSG and 2NSG pronouns may also be plural-suffixed (5.6.3.): yirrug-bulu,
mirrug-bulu.
  The Ergative free pronouns are transparently built on the stems given above by
suffixation of the usual Ergative marker:                Singular            Dual                 Nonsingular
1               ngayug-ji        yawung-guya-yi          ngarrug-ji
                    -                 -                  yirrug-ji
2               yinyang-nyi           —                  nurrug-ji
  With Ergative suffix UN DU form isyawung-guya-yi. The 2NSG and 1EXNSG forms
may, of course, be dual suffixed nurrug-(g)icya-yi andyirrug-(g)uya-yi. A few minor
remarks on the realization of some of these forms are required.
  Although careful pronunciation reveals ngayug-ji as 1SG ERG form, common
realizations include [ngayig-ji}t and ones in which the velar stop loses a great deal of its
occlusive quality, and may be deleted altogether, up to and including [ngayiji]. And
though careful pronunciation reveals (Absolutive) 2SG yinyang, there is a strong
tendency for the α to be raised and fronted following the high front vowel and palatal
nasal, so that a common realization is \yinyeng]. Finally, though the 1EXNSG ABS and
ERG forms yirrug and yirrug-ji are realized with second vowel as it, with the addition
of the dual suffix there is a tendency for the second vowel to lose its rounding and to
assimilate in frontness to the first vowel, yielding realizations approximating
\yirriguyoyi],
  Absolutive pronouns in the function of transitive object of a predicate occur in
conjunction with object pronominal prefixes in the verb marking the object; absolutive
pronouns in the function of intransitive subject, and Ergative pronouns in the function of
transitive subject, occur in conjunction with subject pronominals in the verb. Reflexive
and reciprocal constructions, as is true for other kinds of nominals, require that their
subjects be expressed by Absolutive forms of the independent pronouns.

  These examples illustrate the grammatical and textual contribution of the independent
forms. (186) and (191) illustrate verbless predications, the former with adjectival
nominal, the latter with ""having"" construction as the predicates. In such instances the
free pronouns function by themselves as arguments of the predicate, for subject person
can never be marked directly on the non-verbal predicate in Wardaman (and thus these
constructions contrast markedly with semantically adjectival-predicate and other similar
construction types in southern Arnhem languages of the putative Kunwinykuan group,
see e.g., Merlan 1983: 57-59).
  Elsewhere the free Absolutive pronoun serves to call attention to the person it
designates, also obligatorily marked (as transitive object, or intransitive subject) in the
verbal pronominal complex. (185) is focalized ""They blamed me"" (as compared with
someone else, or contrary to expectation, etc.). (187) illustrates that the free pronoun
functions to make possible qualification of the subject with nominal suffixes such as -biji
Only'. (188), (190) and (195) are examples in which the contrast between two nominals
is expressed with both overt, direct contrast being a sub-category of special salience
which the free pronouns are characteristically used to mark.
  Examples with Ergative case-marked free pronouns are:(196) gurru        girdibun-barra   yirr-(y)ingbe-wuya                  gangga-rlan

  Note here the special anti-benefactive sense of 3SG Dissociative pronoun here,
expressing that ""their"" constant coming and going was a detriment to a major clausal
participant (see 5.2.7.), here presumably to be understood as loosely cohesive with 1SG
free and bound pronominal person (and 1INDU of the previous clause).(199) wonggo            yiniburr-warrang-ma           namaj-(j)i-wi         yinyang-nyi

        '""Wild grape"" belongs to blue-tongue [i.e., is its habitual food], it's for people
        too,WE[lEXNSG]eatit'.
  These examples show that within the transitive subject function, use of free Ergative
pronouns corresponding to subject pronominals in the verb emphasizes the salience of
the transitive subject category, whether in the context of a complete reversal of
participants with respect to subject and object roles in adjacent clauses (197), (199); the
contrast of two entities in different clauses with respect to something, where only one
may be cast grammatically as transitive subject (200); and also seemingly more subtle,
partly grammatical contrasts such as that in (198). In that complex example, in the first
clause 1SG acts on 2SG, ""I stopped you""; the second clause, complement to the first,
expresses what ""I"" stopped ""you"" from doing, i.e., from giving away ""our"" things freely;
the third clause, with 1SG ERG pronoun in first place, shows a return to 1SG as the agent
category, thus contrasting with 2SG of the previous clause. However, first person was
initially agent, in the first clause, and this seemingly accounts for the suffixation of 1SG
ERG pronoun with the ""defocusser"" -wan, which normally occurs on nominal topics (and
sometimes also on other topical constituent units, see 10.3.7. for details). That is,
112 Chapter 6
ERG-marking on 1SG free pronoun marks a change in agent from 2SG of the previous
clause, hence a contrast; but the resumed 1SG agent is topical, not new, hence
""defocussed"". See further 10.11. for comments on pronominal topics.
  So far no third person ""base"" forms have been mentioned. The majority of third-person
referring forms are demonstrative pronouns, that is, they refer with locational contrast as
an inherent element of their meaning (primary spatial contrasts, designating in terms of
relative distance categories with reference to which the textual usage of some of these
forms must be understood). There is only one set of third person forms which is not
inherently demonstrative in this way, and this is a set with stem narnaj evident in all
forms. These are as follows:
                Absolutive                     Ergative
3 SG            narnaj                          narnaj-(j)i
3DU             narnaj-guya                    narnaj-guy a-yi
3PL             narnaj-bulu                    narnaj-bulu-yi
   The forms are entirely regular. It is artificial to make a distinction between 3DU and
3PL here, in fact, on morphological grounds there is no distinction to be made even
between singular and nonsingular: the single stem narnaj is inflected with ordinary dual
and plural number forms. It is of interest, however, to note that an additional nonsingular
form with suffixal element -ganung, i.e., 3NSG namaj-ganung, has been recorded. This
suffix is also found with some of the demonstrative stems, see 7.2. All of these third
person forms are frequently found (in both Absolutive and Ergative case-functions) with
article-suffix (see 5.7.), e.g., narnaj-bi 3SG ABS; narnaj-guya-yi-wi 3DU ERG, etc. Use
of these forms is illustrated in the following examples:(201)    wonggo      yanggun-bu-n       wurren                         worlog-ba
        neg          3SG/3NSG-AUX-PRES child-ABS                       wash-PS
        ya-0-bu-yi-n          narnaj-bi
        3-3SG-AUX-RR-PRES self-ABS-ART
        'She is not washing the children, she is washing herself.
  (Note that 3NSG object ""children"" is marked in the verbal pronominal prefix, but that
the external nominal wurren is formally singular; it is not uncommon that PL not be
marked on the noun, though it is more usually marked on human as opposed to
non-human nouns.) Here the 3SG base form narnaj functions to make salient the
intransitive subject/reflexive object category by contrast with another object
(""children""), in the same way that has been illustrated for the free (first and second)
person forms.
  A third person Ergative-marked form was illustrated in (199) above.(202)    wonggo        yinga-na-n                      gurlurrg        gija     narnaj
        neg            IRR1SG/3SG-AUX-PRES             sorry           as       3SGABS
        gurlurrg-marla-wagbawun
        sorry-ITER-lacking-AB S
        Ί can't be sorry for him, just as HE has no compassion'.
                                           Independent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 113  In (202), again as in many of the examples with free person forms, the contrastive
function of narnaj is associated with the switch of participants in relation to clause
function in adjacent clauses. A comparison is emphasized between the relation of
transitive subject ""I"" of the first clause to the ""him"" of that clause, with the ""he"" of the
second, by the use ofnamaj.
  Finally concerning third person forms, it needs to be mentioned that there is a non-
demonstrative, third person pronominal base ngajbang, which may usually be translated
""self or ""selves"", and which generally serves the emphatic function which that
translation suggests. In addition to being approximately equivalent to the ""myself of ""I
myself will do it"" (as contrasted with another's doing it), it very often has, like the English
emphatic form, the meaning ""by oneself, alone"". This form may be suffixed for dual or
plural number with the usual suffixes, but it may also function without such overt number
suffixation in apposition to nonsingular nominals, as in ngajbang-bi ngabobu-mulu
yinggi 'your father's mothers and mother's brothers themselves', ABS. And though
basically a third person category, it may function in apposition to any person category,
as the following examples illustrate:(203)   narnaj-bi          0-yanggi          ngajbang-bi
        3SGABS-ART         3SG-goPST         self-ABS-ART
        'He went himself.(204)   ngayug-bi            nganjagi        ngajbang-bi
        1SG ABS-ART          1SG go PST      self-ART
        Ί went myself.(205)    dang-mulu   yinyganymirra-mulu                ya-wurr-yu             ngajbang

        self ABS-ART [ss]-PLABS                        self ABS-ART 3-3NSG-sleep PRES
        'These women of yinyganymirra subsection live separately, by themselves, and
        these men of yanymirra subsection live by THEMselves'.(206)    duba    ya-0-jingi-n            ngajbang-bi             yi-bayin-barra-yi
        sit      3-3SG-AUX-PRES          self-ABS-ART           YI-mother-in-law-ADV-ADV
        'He sits alone by himself, with his mother-in-law'.(207)   mulurru-wuya               wurrugu             ngajbang-guya-yi
        old woman-DU ABS           3NSG DAT            self-DU-ERG
        'And their old women, the two of them by themselves [put it]'.
  In (207) a complex ellipsis of a predicate expression is the reason for the apparently
fragmentary syntax; but the much larger context is not relevant here, the point being
simply to illustrate the ""self form with dual and case suffixes.
114 Chapter 6
6.3. Dative or ""general oblique"" free formsContrasting with the 'base' pronominal series on which Absolutive and Ergative forms
are built is a Dative or general oblique series, with wide-ranging functions. These forms
have already been extensively exemplified in this grammar because of their ubiquity.
Forms in this series are:
                SG                DUAL                   NSG
1SG             nganu             yawu                   ngarrugu
                                                         yirrugu
2SG             yinggi                                   nurrugu
3SG             gunga                                    wurrugu  As elsewhere in the person system, there is no morphological difference between dual
and plural stem forms for the categories 1 EX, 2 and 3 nonsingulars. There is one form
in each category which may be dual-suffixed to explicitly distinguish dual from (other)
nonsingulars: yirrugu-wuya, nurrugu-wuya, and wurrugu-wuya. Though the 1IN
category is morphologically of the same series as these, it is inherently more than dual
nonsingular, and cannot be dual-suffixed. The UN DU form, yawu, may probably be
taken as the basic stem (which, as shown in 6.1., is nasal-augmented and dual-suffixed
in the ""base"" series ioyawung-guya). The 3SG form, as described in 3.9., is often realized
as [g ]. As in the ""base"" series, there is commonly fronting and unrounding of the second
stem vowel in the 1EXNSG form to something approximating [yirrlgu].
  The Dative series fulfills a set of functions within the clause which are all characterized
by relative obliqueness of the pronominal relation to the predicate, as compared with the
major syntactic (verbally-marked) clause functions. They specify the pronominal object
complement in many intransitive clauses, including in clauses of ""saying to"" which are
normally, but not invariably, intransitive; they specify the pronominal benefactive (and
sometimes also, semantically ""anti-benefactive"") complement of the intransitive and
transitive (excepting ditransitive) clause; and they mark possession in agreement with a
Dative-marked pronominal possessor, or otherwise in apposition to a free Genitive
pronominal possessor; they mark the pronominal complement of adverbs of location and
other (temporal) position. Examples in these functions are:(208)    yi-jurn-nya  nga-gi-we       gunga   wurre-wu                   bingmarla
         YI-face-LOC ISG-put-FUT     3SG DAT child-DAT                   (yellow) paint
        nga-gi-we    gunga      yanjigbe    nganu                        yi-borrordin-gurne
        ISG-put-FUT 3SGDAT 3SGgoFUT 1SGDAT                               YI-pretty-CAUS
        Ί have to put paint on the child's face, I have to put it on him so he will look
        nice forme'.
  The first Dative series pronoun is gunga, which constitutes a phrase with wurre-wu;
note that the exact place (""face"") where the paint is to be put may not be analyzed as part
of the same phrase, but is treated separately by Locative case-marking. The second
Dative pronoun is 1SG nganu, which is semantically benefactive (""for me"") or ""ethical
                                          Independent pronouns and person-maridng in the verb 115
Dative"" (""on, in relation to, to me""), and in any event marks a pronominal complement
which has a rather oblique relation to the predicate, here ""go"".(209) nga-jaba-rri    wujaban       darni                nganinggin           yilania
       ISG-build-PST house-ABS yonder                    mine-GEN-ABS          reckon
      ya-0-nyani-we        nuilurru                     nganu       yirr-wa-wu
      3-3SG-come-FTJT      old woman-ABS                1SGDAT      company-PS-DAT
        ' I built my own house over there, maybe the old woman will come and keep
        me company'.
 Here the 1SG oblique nganu is complement of ""come"", and occurs in construction with
Dative-marked particle_y/rr-/7ii7 'company, keep company'.(210)   nyilg           ye-0-wenwen           ngarrugu
        sprinkle        3-3SG-AUXrdp          1INPLDAT
        'It's sprinkling on us'.
  In (210) ngarrugu is obliquely linked to the particle plus auxiliary construction
""sprinkle"".(211) lay in            gangman              nu-yo              ngarrugu
      game-ABS          kangaroo-ABS         2NSG-spear         1INPL DAT
        ' You shoot a kangaroo for us'.
 In (211) Dative ngarrugu is the beneficiary of the imperative 'shoot'.(212) ngayugu wonggo    ngani-warrangnia wonggo      ngayugu
      1SGABS neg        2SG/lSG-swear     neg        1SGABS
      yinggi    yi-ngawuyu      ngayugu       yinggi  yi-geyu
       2SGDAT   YI-wife-ABS     ISO ABS 2     SGDAT YI-B Ch
        'Don't swear at ME, I'm not a wife to you, I'm your niece' [or, 'niece to you'].
  In (212) free pronouns are amply illustrated. There are two oblique forms, bothyinggi
'yours, to you'. Here, the Dative contrasts with what would normally be use of the free
Genitive pronoun fyinggawun 'yours', which very often occurs with the corresponding
Dative pronoun in apposition, see 6.4.). An attempt is made to render the difference
between Genitive and the use of Dative here by means of the translation e.g., ""wife to
you"" instead of ""your wife"", and implying a more indirect relation than is expressed by
means of the Genitive pronoun.(213) yirr-worlorbna-rri-ya         wurrugu          mernde-wu             bornborn-gu
      1EX NSG-fill-PST-NAR          3NSGDAT          European-DAT          bathe-DAT
        'We filled it up for the Europeans' baths' [or, 'for the Europeans to bathe'].
  Here 3NSG wurrugu occurs as benefactive complement of ""fill"", and as part of a more
complex construction, with Dative pronoun and modified Dative nominal (Europeans),
and further complemented by a Dative-inflected particle ""bathe"".

        'Talk loudly to them, they've got to listen to you'.
  Here the 3NSG Dative occurs as indirect object complement of a verb of speaking,
ngorlog-ba-.(215) yibiwan-guya     darni       guyamn    bega-wu     ya-wud-janga-n

        'Two men yonder are coming asking for/to ask for tobacco he said to the white
         man Oh! you call out to the two of them, he said to him'.
  In (215), 3SG ΌΑΓgunga occurs as pronominal complement of the verb of saying, but
is associated with a Dative phrase ""white man"" which makes explicit the nominal
complement of the verb of saying. There is also 3NSG DAT pronoun as complement of
the verb gaygba-' to call out'.(216)   ngana-nja       guji      yawn
        3SGHT-go        first     1INDUDAT
        'Let him go before us'.
  (216) illustrates UN DU Dative pronoun as complement oiguji 'first, in the first place,
before'.(217)   nga-jingi-n               duba        vinggi           wu-lirrwa

  In 5.2.3. there occurred a number of examples of Dative pronouns in possessive
constructions, and these will not be further illustrated here. But see also 5.4.","[131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140]"
"
10.11. Pronominal topicsIt is commonly said of non-Pama-Nyungan languages as well as some others which have
participant marking on the verb, that pronouns are mainly used ""emphatically"", for
example, contrastively (e.g., Merlan 1983; Heath 1984). This is true of Wardaman, where
topic pronominals of the absolutive independent series typically establish someone as of
especial pronominence in relation to a verb. The construction can be illustrated from text.
250 Chapter 10  In the Onion text, the speaker is setting the scene, and establishes in short order what
three people concerned with the action were doing:(603) ngayugu      nga-dagbarla-rri             anyin
      1SG-ABS      ISG-have-PST                [onion]-ABS
      Ί had the onion'.        dorij-ji      0-ginye-rri-ya                 lay in

        DORIS was cooking meat'.        nganinggin yi-marnayn         ya-0-nyanga-n                     dawung-ba

        'My HUSBAND is coming from that way'.
  In first position in each unit there seems to be a participant presented as a piece of new
and salient information. Notice that one might expect ngayugu in the first unit to be
ergative-marked, but it is not. This may be due to absolutive forms being the normal, or
""unmarked"" topic series for personal pronouns, and this may override the grammatical
function of 1SG in the particular instance.
  Other examples are drawn from the text Elsie, which exhibits numerous such first
person topics as might be expected in a narrative of personal biography.(604) yibujgun        im rekan

"
6.5. Genitive independent pronouns
In addition to ""base"" and Dative series pronominal forms, there is a distinct Genitive
series, with the following forms:
                SG               DUAL                    NSG
1               nganinggin       yawunggin               ngarmgun.gin
                                                         yirrugun.gin
2               yinggawun                                nurrugun.gin
3               gungan.gin                               wurrugun.gin  The genitive element in this series (except for 2SG) is evidently -gin (see 11.4.), and it
would appear that, historically, this series was built on the Dative, but has subsequently
become formally independent of the latter.
  The genitive series serves: adnominally, to mark the pronominal possessor, sometimes
in conjunction with a free Dative form of the same propositus person; to mark that a
                                        Independent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 119
contextually understood or specifiable, but lexically unspecified, nominal is possessed.
Such a ""headless"" Genitive phrase functions itself as predicate argument. The Genitive
pronouns, as attributives and as arguments in their own right, may be inflected for the
full range of nominal case endings, as exemplified with 1SG:
     Absolutive                 nganinggin
     Ergative                   nganinggin-yi
     Dative                     nganinggin-gu
     Locative                   nganinggin-ya
     Allative                   nganinggin-garr
     Ablative                   nganinggin-ba
     Dissociative               nganinggin-gunya
     Source                     nganinggin-gunba
     Originative                nganinggin-jila
  In keeping with the fact that Genitive pronouns may by themselves function as core
arguments, they may be appropriately translated in some contexts as ""on me"", ""from me"",
and the like; that is, express personal reference, rather than being modifiers. The
following exemplify the different uses of the Genitive forms:(221) dalgirrig        ya-0-jingi-n                 nganinggin-ya
      lean             3-3SG-AUX-PRES               1SGGEN-LOC
       'He is leaning on me'.
  Here Locative-marked 1SG Genitive pronoun is non-attributive complement of the
particle plus auxiliary construction meaning ""lean on"", which ordinarily has Locative
complement.(222) nganinggin-yi       ngabobu-yi        duwu-ma           0-bu-ndi
      1SG GEN-ERG         FM-ERG            rear-PS           3SG-AUX-PST

      tobacco-ABS fire-ABS as      1EXNSG-ERG HAB-lEXNSG-get-PRES
      yirrugun.gin        mayin        wurrugu      wurre-wu     nu-jingi

       'Let the grog be, leave it, get meat and food, tobacco and matches as we always
       get ours, food for the children, live without grog like us'.
  In (223) the Genitive pronoun yirrugun.gin serves as attributive of a nominal phrase
(presumably ""meat, food"" etc. actually ellipsed within the prosodic line, which ended
with the possessive pronoun in the original utterance). The speaker resumes with the
120 Chapter 6phrase ""food for the children"". Further examples illustrating a variety of points are all
drawn from a single text:(224) nganinggin           yibiyi         wonggo 0-jarram-bu-rri  nganu   ngawun
      1SGGEN-ABS           father-ABS     neg    3SG-look for-PST 1SG DAT no
        'My father didn't look for me, no'.(225)   guyamin        jadede      nganinggin  yibiwi     0-lu-rri-ya nganu
        two-ABS         [Saturday] ISO GEN-ABS father-ABS 3SG-cry-PST 1SGDAT
        '[For] two Saturdays my father cried for me'.
  Both examples have Genitive pronouns in modifier function. Notice that both clauses
are syntactically Absolutive-Dative, that is, with oblique complement of ""look (for)"" and
""cry (for)"", as is characteristic for both.(226) guyamin         ngabobu             nganinggin            ngorlog-ba

  Note the order in the phrase ""my two grandmothers"", numeral-modified-modifier (and
compare with 227); and also that, with explicit numeral ""two"", dual marking is foregone.
This frequently happens, but sometimes dual marking occurs in the presence of numeral.(227)   nganinggin             mulurru                yi-barnang

  (227) is organized in prosodic lines as originally spoken. See 10.3. - 10.4. for
discussion of ordering in the noun phrase, and the possessive noun phrase in particular.(228)   0-yana-rri   go          mulurru-wu                    yi-ngawuyu      go

        FM-DAT      1SG GEN-DAT
        'He told the old woman, my father's mother's sister-in-law ...'
  The modifying phrase which specifies the identity of the old woman (""my father's
mother's sister-in-law"") is not Dative-marked to agree with ""old woman"" in the main
clause, but rather is an Absolutive identifying phrase with Dative possessor phrase. The
                                         Independent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 121
ordering in that phrase is modified-Genitive modifier, which as can be seen from the
other examples given above, alternates rather freely with the reverse order.(229) nganinggin           badbad            wurr-gi-ndi-ya
      1SGGEN-ABS           cover             3NSG-put-PST-NAR

       only    YI-Ch-PL-ABS 3SGDAT 3NSG/lSG-put-PST poison-having-AB S
       'They beat him severely and he left he died on my account, only his children
       called me a sorcerer'.
  This example shows a Dissociative-marked Genitive pronoun meaning ""on account of
me, on my account"". In the context, the speaker's meaning was not literally that the man
referred to had died on her account, but there is here rather more complex attribution of
""authorship"". The speaker's meaning was that the man's children said that he had died
on account of her — they alleged she had poisoned him; thus the ""voice"" of the clause
""he died on my account"" is that of the man's accusing relatives, yi-geye-mulu, somewhat
unsually in this syntactic context, occurs in Absolutive (rather than Ergative) form.
However, that may be linked to the fact that the speaker paused briefly following the
phrase ""his children"", perhaps considering how to put the unpleasant accusation. (In the
first line, digirrij may mean either (completely) dead, or as we say, ""near-dead"",
""half-dead"", or the like. Here, the meaning is that the beating was severe, but that the
man was able to carry himself off).
  Finally, when Genitive pronouns are used in headless phrases, it is rather common that
the possessive phrase be expanded by use of a complementary free Dative pronoun of
the same person and number (see also 10.4.). For example, a typical verbless predication
of possession is of the following sort:(231) nana             nganinggin nganu  /                     gungan.gin gunga
      that-ABS         1SGGEN-ABS 1SGDAT                       3SGGEN-ABS 3SG DAT
       'That is mine'/'That is his, hers'.
  An example of this kind of Absolutive Genitive, which in context occurred as object
of the verb ""put"", is:(232) nganinggin           nganu             ngajbang-bi
      1SGGEN-ABS           1SGDAT            self-ABS-ART
       '[They put] mine by itself.
122 Chapter 6
6.6. Derivatives of ""base"" pronouns: Article-suffixed and ""first""
     free formsThe base pronominal forms, Absolutive and Ergative, in their functions as explained in
6.1. above, commonly occur suffixed with the article -hi ~ -wi. The article suffix (as
described in 5.7.), when added to a non-nominal part of speech, serves to nominalize or
make more concrete its reference; and when added to a nominal form, does something
like make its reference more definite, in a way that is often best translatable by English
substitutive ""one"" (""big one"", etc.). Yet the article cannot be regarded as a form that
stands in place of an ellipsed lexical expression (as English substitutive ""one"" does).
Rather, in keeping with the fact that Wardaman nominals of adjectival kind very
commonly constitute a nominal phrase by themselves (see Chapter 4), what the article
does is to suggest more concretely a domain of reference of which the current nominal
token is ""one"". The article suffix thus performatively marks, not ellipsis, but
definitivization.
  The article suffix is commonly added to free pronouns, both Absolutive and Ergative
(see an example of the latter in (199)). Following the Ergative suffix, the article
invariably has the shape -wi; thus the Ergative-article sequence is yi-wi, as in 1SG
ERG-ART ngayug-ji-wi, etc. However, in the Absolutive series we find apocope of the
final vowel of the 1SG form before the article suffix, the occurring form being not
ngayugu-wi but ngayug-bi. For the sake of clarity the article-suffixed Absolutive forms
are listed:
     1SG              ngayug-bi
     2SG              yinyang-bi
     l IN DU          yawung-guya-wi
     1 IN PL          ngarrug-bi
     1EXNSG           yirrug-bi
     2NSG             nurrug-bi (also nurrug-(g)uya-wi DU, nurrug-bulu-wi PL)
     3SG              narnaj-bi
     3DU              narnaj-guya-wi
     3PL              narnaj-bulu-wi, narnaj-ganung-bi
 With the free pronouns, the article suffix usually contributes an emphatic element of
meaning reinforcing the pronoun's reference, something like ""I myself, as in:(233) nga-gaju-wa               ngayug-bi
       ISG-arise-FUT            1SG-ABS-ART
      Ί for one will get up', Ί myself will get up'.
  In comparison with this, as observed in 6.1., the essentially third person form ngajbang
which may occur with any person/number form, is often understood to express a different
nuance, ""I alone"", or ""I by myself.
  Built on the base stems, and showing the same slight differences from the latter as the
article-suffixed forms, is a series which expresses that the referent of the pronoun is
                                          Independent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 123""first"". This series is formed with the suffix -baywa ~ -waywa. It is syntactically
anomalous in that it often is understood as in construction with a transitive subject
pronominal form in the verb, in which instance one normally expects any external
pronoun to be Ergative-marked. The ordinary interpretation of these forms, however,
appears to be as in construction with the agent pronominal in transitive clauses, despite
the absence of Ergative marking, as in:(234)   ngayug-baywa              ngawun-da-rri
        1SG ABS-first             1 SG/3NSG-see-PST
        Ί saw them first' [I before others saw them].(235)   namaj-baywa               ngan-da-rri
        3SG ABS-first             3SG/lSG-see-PST
        'He saw me first' [he before others].
  Like the article suffix, this suffix is final, and follows any overtly-marked dual number:
e.g., nurrug-(g)uya-waywa 'you two first'.
  This suffix has also been found with certain primary adverbs to create secondary ones
which seem to have a somewhat more explicit relational sense, e.g., fromjaburru 'ahead,
in front', jaburrung-baywa 'first, ahead of anyone'. It is also suffixed to nominal stems
to create more adverbial forms of manner: yi-bam-baywa 'head-first', banggin-baywa
'back-first'.","[142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]"

   neighbouring languages (e.g., Jawoyn, and with some differences, also Mangarrayi). However,
   in those languages the prefix is limited to the non-past, and contrasts with zero in the past
   categories. In Wardaman, what is apparently etymologically the same element ya- occurs in
   the irrealis, and may occur in the past irrealis. Further discussion, however, makes it clear that
   ya- probably diffused into the irrealis paradigm in order to prevent homophony of a considerable
   number of otherwise homo-phonous forms. Therefore in its occurrence in the irrealis, να- cannot
   be considered directly comparable to the non-past marker ya- though, as noted, it is probably
   etymologically the same form.
126 Chapter 6  3SG subject is 0-. Several forms (1EX, UN PL, 3NSG) show a nonsingular (subject)
element -rr-, just as the same categories do in the free pronouns. However, this element
cannot be neatly identified synchronically as a ""nonsingular"" marker (i.e., of a category
which does not distinguish dual and plural) because of the UN PL form, which must be
regarded as explicitly ""plural"" because it contrasts, formally and semantically, with the
UN DU prefix category. The same categories as in the free pronouns (1EX, 2NSG,
3NSG) may properly be regarded as ""nonsingular"" in that dual and plural are not
distinguished (in a morphologically primary way, though dual may be distinguished by
suffixation to the verb, as described in 5.6.2.).
  2NSG unexpectedly fails to exhibit the number element -rr-, and thus marks 2NSG
person/number in a more synthetic fashion than the other categories.
  The l IN DU form is seemingly transparent, identifiable with ISGnga-, combined with
a 2SG element -yi-.","[149, 150]"
"6.7.3. Irrealis person- and mood-markingUnlike the initial prefix ya- which occurs in non-past but not past indicative tense-
mood-aspect forms of the verb (6.6.), irrealis marking as described below remains the
same on non-past and past irrealis forms of the verb. The meanings and uses of the verb
forms are described in 8.9.
  The canonical mark of irrealis mood is initial prefix (preceding pronominal elements)
yi- for non-third subject person categories, and ya-yi- for third subject categories.
However, this distinction is not realized in this canonical form in all person-number forms
of the verb: second person subject categories diverge from the pattern, and so do those
forms with first-ordered pronominal element (yi-) representing the person-number
category 1EX NSG, in ways detailed below.",[157]
"
12. Close linguistic relationships
Wardaman is a close congener of Yangman and Dagoman (see 1.3., also Map 2). From
available information, the three may apparently be considered dialects of a single
language. They were of such a degree of structural and lexical similarity as to be mutually
intelligible.
  Dagoman is no longer spoken in the Katherine region. There were formerly speakers
at Manbulloo Station and in Katherine town camps, and a few others at Pine Creek. The
writer did a small amount of work on Dagoman in the late 1970s with a reputed ""last""
speaker at Pine Creek, Mrs. Martha Hart, who, after long infirmity, passed away in 1982.
The amount of information I succeeded in collecting is small. There is a short word list,
and paradigmatic information (with gaps) on the system of nominal case and derivational
suffixation, tense-aspect in the verb, independent pronouns, and demonstratives. In the
data are also intransitive and some transitive pronominal combinations which are
prefixed to the verb, but the speaker was unable to recall all of them. The data are
sufficient to establish beyond doubt that Dagoman was a close congener of both
Wardaman and Yangman.
                                                                                 Introduction 3   Yangman is no longer actively used. Yangman had been most widely spoken at Elsey
Station and the neighbouring town of Mataranka, but the numbers of active speakers
among these people and their descendants have dwindled. Among those with the best
knowledge of the language are now a number of Mangarrayi people at the excision
community, Jilkminggan [Jilgmirn.gan], on Elsey Station, and a small number of people
at Barunga, a settlement to the north of the Roper River. The Mangarrayi have lived and
intermarried with the Yangman at least since the building of Elsey Station on the Roper
River in the early years of this century (see Merlan 1978).
   Though I have collected Yangman material from Mangarrayi people, I consider my
most significant data to have come from Mr. Jimmy Daniels, who was widely regarded
around Mataranka in the early 1980s as a (if not the) senior Yangman person, and the
only remaining person for whom Yangman was not only his ""own"" and ""proper""
language, but also his first language. He passed away in 1986 after prolonged and chronic
illness. Though Mr. Daniels consented to work with me on different occasions, his
personal preference was not to use or even think about Yangman much, as he told me.
Having spent quite a number of years as a highly regarded grounds worker on a station
in the region, he seemed to find the illness-ridden, less structured existence of his
""retirement"" years somewhat disspiriting and frustrating.
   I am grateful for the information he provided, which includes about 500 lexical items,
fuller paradigmatic information than I could gather for Dagoman, and a couple of short
stories. From these data it is possible to be certain of the close genetic relation of
Yangman to Wardaman. Work with him also provided some measure of the extent to
which first-language Mangarrayi speakers with whom I did work on Yangman, were
interpolating Mangarrayi vocabulary. Most showed a tendency to use some words which
Mr Daniels rejected as not Yangman. I can only assume they are probably more prone
to do this now than the same people would have been twenty or thirty years ago, when
there were some Yangman people around who, because of their identity and use of the
language, kept it more current in the local communities among second-language
speakers.
  Finally, though Wardaman and its congeners appear to share considerable vocabulary
and many typological features with Wakiman to the north (see Cook 1987), it cannot
presently be stated with certainty what the nature of the relationship is, although my own
view is that Wakiman is closely related to Wardaman-Yangman, and has diverged from
them partly due to influence from neighbouring Arnhem-area languages.
  In certain basic ways, such as phonemic inventory, Wakiman differs significantly from
its presumed close congeners, Wardaman and Yangman: it has two stop series
intervocalically (e.g., a contrast between bilabials b and;?, apicals d and t, etc.); there is
no phonemic distinction between alveolar and retroflex apical stops, which is
fundamental in all the other languages; it has glottal stop, which is not even phonetically
of any significant occurrence in Wardaman, Yangman, or Dagoman, and so on. However,
when one considers the possible diffusional influences of neighbouring Amhem-area
languages on Wakiman in some of these matters, it still seems quite possible that its
closest congeners may be the Wardaman-Yangman-Dagoman grouping. Typologically,
in certain very significant ways, such as the syntactic deployment of what I call verbal
4 Chapter 1
""particles"" (see Chapter 9) and Cook calls ""participles"", Wakiman is very like Wardaman
and Yangman, and all of them taken together differ dramatically not only from regional
Arnhem languages like Jawoyn which do not rely on such verbal particles to any
significant extent, but also from languages like Mangarrayi which do. In Mangarrayi
(see Merlan 1982) the syntactic deployment of verb particles is very different from the
possibilities in Wakiman and Wardaman etc., and rather limited in comparison with the
latter grouping of languages.","[26, 27, 28]"
"
10.7. Discontinuous constituency
There are numerous examples in which nominal constituents of groups which occur on
a single tone unit, and might be on semantic and syntactic grounds analyzed as members
of a single noun phrase, nevertheless occur separated from each other, sometimes by a
number of words.(593)   oni    majadmajad               yirr-me-ndi-ya                    mayin
        [only] MA-big-rdp-ABS           lEXNSG-get-PST-NAR                food-ABS
        'We only got big tubers'.
  From the preceding context, ""vegetable food"" seems to be presupposed, while ""big""
appears to be contrastive with ""little ones"" (vegetables) of the preceding tone group. In
the next example, wu-jad 'big' modifies yibumbu 'billycan':(594) yibumbu            yanima-n joy nganburr-wo-ndi-ya-wuya                     wu-jad
      billy-ABS          thus-ABS give 3NSG/lSG-give-PST-NAR-DU                   WU-big-ABS
        'They gave me a big billycan like this'.
  Here, in context, the information focus appears to be on the deictic ""like this"", and
generally, on the size of the billycan, further expressed by the qualifier in final position.
In the following tone unit the billycan is further described, by an adjectival nominal set
off on its own tone, as ""clean"".
  In the next example, yidinen-bi 'whole' modifies the earlier occurring lege walanja
One goanna':(595) lege               walanja            nga-ga-ndi         go      yidinen-bi
      one-ABS            goanna-ABS         ISG-take-PST       3SG-DAT whole-ART
        Ί took one goanna for him whole'.
  In this context, the referent ""goanna"" appears to be considered recoverable, and was
explicitly mentioned in the previous tone group. What seems to be presented as salient
is that, on one occasion, the speaker took back a whole goanna for her father.(596) ma-garlarl             0-we-ndi-ya              ma-nyeyn
      MA-clean-ABS           3SG-fall-PST-NAR         MA-body-ABS
        'The vegetable matter fell down clean'/ 'the clean vegetable matter fell down'.
 In context, a contrast is being made between the ""body"" which falls away clean after
winnowing, and the skin (mentioned in first position in the following tone unit) which
242 Chapter 10must be put to one side. The focus appears to be on ""flesh"" and ultimately the contrast
between ""flesh"" and ""skin"".(597) ma-jad             wurr-nwrnbu-rri-ya           mayin              yanima-n
      MA-big-ABS         3NSG-make-PST-NAR            food-ABS           thus-ABS
        'They made a big loaf of it like this'.
  In context, the speaker has referred to vegetable paste from which she says a big loaf
(mayin)' like this' is made. The focus of information appears to be on the nature and size
of the loaf, and perhaps particularly on the deictic ""like this"".(598) wwren              0-dagbarla-rri      wudu
      child-ABS          3SG-have-PST        little-ABS
        'She had a little child'.
  This tone unit occurs early in a narration (Gawalyan 2) in which very little is
presupposed; only gawalyan 'porcupine' has been mentioned as protagonist in the
preceding tone unit.
  Questions arise about the textual significance of such preferred constructions, and
possible constituent analysis of them. It would seem that the earlier-occurring lexemes
are part of what each tone group as a whole ""is about"", or constitute part of the theme,
in that sense, of each. However, those lexemes in first position generally seem, in context,
to be less a focus of the information unit as a whole than other later-occurring elements
with which they are cohesive. As the above examples suggest, the nominal prefix system
of Wardaman may play a particular role in making explicit the link between such
discontinous elements. In general terms, my hypothesis is that this is a kind of
discontinuity which breaks up a larger theme into parts, the earlier (at least in general, if
not in every case) through this presentation rendered as more fully presupposed, the later
as more in-focus for one reason or another e.g., because it is contrastive, or otherwise the
less presupposable element of the theme as a whole.
  Are such constructions to be analyzed as one phrase or two? All of those illustrated
occur on a single tone unit, and we have hypothesized above that the discontinuity plays
a role in distributing information over that unit, representing an intersection of Theme
with Given/New contrasts. Partly because these constructions occur on a single tone
unit, I provisionally regard each one as a single noun phrase, and the discontinuity as as
a way in which more highly presupposable (but not completely given and ellipsable)
nominal reference is carried through the text. The common reference of both parts
reinforces the identification of participants, but distribution of information into two parts
allows one to be presented as more highly presupposed than the other, and (generally)
less highly contrastive with surrounding nominal expressions. Where information is
distributed discontinuously in this way, first position appears to be more strongly
associated with more highly presupposed thematic elements, final position with those
that are less so.

10.8. Summary of noun phrase constituencyWe may now draw together a summary of basic noun phrase constituency discussed so
far, and briefly consider aspects of noun phrase coordination.
  We may minimally identify structural noun phrase types as shown in Table 17.","[265, 266, 267]"
"
7.2. Demonstrative categories and some related forms
The demonstrative pronouns, may serve either as modifiers within a nominal phrase, or
like all sub-types of nominal in Wardaman, may by themselves constitute the sole,
reference-making member of a nominal phrase. As modifiers, they normally occur
within a phrase preceding the modified, but the reverse order may be found (10.3., 10.9.).
As modifiers and arguments, the demonstrative pronouns may be inflected for the range
of nominal case-suffixes.
  The system of demonstratives shows a tripartite division in terms of spatial categories
which will be called ""Immediate"", ""Proximate"" and ""Remote"". These categories are
roughly translatable in English as ""this"", ""that"" and ""yonder"", and the spatial and textual
semantics of all of them will be illustrated below. In summary fashion, the spatial
reference of the Immediate category is in the vicinity of the speech situation, and may
designate within the vicinity of the speaker, hearer or both. Something that is designated
as ""that"" in the sense of distal from speaker but close to hearer is liable to be coded with
the Proximate category, but never with the remote category as it is still within range of
the location of the speech event. The Immediate and Remote categories are the most
closely linked in most of their uses to spatial semantics, although forms of the immediate
category may have textually immediate reference to that just said or about to be said.
The Remote category is most restricted to spatial reference in the extra-linguistic context
138 Chapter?(as opposed to linguistic), and its use seems to be to refer to things, objects, locations etc.
which are generally visible from the location of the speech event, or portrayed as visible
from the perspective of a narrated or reported speech event, but in either case distal from
it.
   This leaves relatively unspecified the proximate category, which is in fact widest of the
three in its range of uses, and the least restricted in its textual and other extended
distribution. As noted above, it may designate within the general vicinity of the speech
situation something that is distal from speaker and close to hearer, or something that is
distal from both but still relatively close. Further, it is the category generally used to
code the textual familiarity of some nominal, where its use often amounts to specification
of definiteness of the referent via its proximate text-spatial semantics. In this definite-
marking usage it is often best translated by English definite article. It is also the category
most widely used to mark the relation of units of text to others, by means of inflected
forms which mean such things as ""and then, after that"", and so on.
  Case forms in the three series are shown in Table 12. Stem morphology is not
complicated: each series has an Absolutive form, and a stem-form used with non-zero
suffixes. The two stems differ most unpredictably for the remote category.","[161, 162]"
"5.2.1. Ergative and instrumental casesCase-marking of the transitive subject nominal is formally identical to marking of the
instrumental one. However, the two case functions can be distinguished syntactically in
that the instrumental noun is not marked in the verb. The following exemplify Ergative

  Ergative typically marks the nominal transitive subject even where there may be no
expressed nominal object, but only object marking on the verb (zero for third person
singular. See 10.10. for discussion of the ordering of lexically realized nominal
functions).
  There are a number of verbal meanings for which pairs of verbs are found, one member
of the pair transitively used, the other intransitively. Examples are the pairs burla-ma-
'deceive, lie to' and burla-yi- 'tell lies'; geng-ma- 'to fear' and gengmi-yi- 'be afraid of
(with Dative object). The ""mediopassive"" forms appear to be used more frequently to
designate typical disposition, the others to designate particular events; thus,
ya-wurr-burla-yi-n is often used to mean 'they tell lies' (typically). (See 8.12. for the
'mediopassive' category.)
  By ""ditransitive"" constructions are meant those in which there are two notional (and
sometimes, overtly expressed or non-zero) objects. One of these is typically animate,
and generally, but not always, also human, the notional ""indirect object""; the other is
usually inanimate, the notional ""direct object"" of the action. Verbs or verb plus particle
constructions which are typical predicates of such clauses, include: wo- 'give to';jewu-
'show to, teach'; also birrg gerne- 'to take from', mowo- 'to steal from\jomarna~ 'finish'
(e.g., food). Examples with such predicates illustrate the case-marking of associated
nominals:
66 Chapters(8)    yarrimanbu-yi  birrg     0-geme-rri
       taipan-ERG     take      3SG-AUX-PST

        'Taipan took it away, he took the poison away from King Brown'.
  Here, the first prosodic line is equivalent to a clause, with Ergative-marked nominal
""taipan"", but no overt nominal object. That object is made overt initially in the following
line by Absolutive-marked ""King Brown"", the notional indirect object. Notional direct
object is expressed by Absolutive-marked ""poison"".(9)    ngani-jomarna-rri          mayin               gabarn         ngong-jomarna-rri

       3NSG/lSG-give-PRES             WU-money-ABS              child-PL-ERG
        ""The children give me money'.
  Here the notional indirect object ""me"" is expressed by object pronominal only in the
verb; notional direct object ""money"" outside the verb only by Absolutive noun; and
transitive subject by Ergative-marked 'children'.(11)   ngan-jewu-rri               madin
       3SG/lSG-show-PST            language-ABS
        'She taught me language'.
  Here again, notional indirect object is expressed only on the verb, as is typical (although
emphasis could be given by use of the Absolutive independent 1SG pronoun). There
could be Ergative-marked nominal transitive subject. A ditransitive construction of this
kind contrasts syntactically with one involving verb particle plus auxiliary of similar
meaning, but in which the indirect object is expressed with the Dative (see 5.2.3.), and
the notional direct object, once again with Absolutive-marked nominal:(12)   milid        0-gi-ndi                nganu              madin
       show         3SG-AUX-PST             1SGDAT             language-ABS

       'She showed the place to me'.
  The verb yana- 'to say (to)' usually occurs with Dative ""person to whom"" something
is said. However, it has alternatively been found to occur with ""person to whom"" treated
as direct object, as in the following example where it occurs with particle jarnbab 'try
                                                     Nominal classes, inflection and derivation 67to, persist in (unsuccessfully)' (Kriol 'hard work (la)'). Compare the alternative case
frames:(14)   jambab wurr-yana-rri           yinggi    wonggo              yinimburr-wo-n

       'They kept telling you they won't give you [any, anything]'.
  As already noted, nominals functioning instrumentally can be distinguished from
transitive subject nominals in that they are not in agreement with pronominal marker on
the verb. For example, the verb ba- 'burn, thirst, perish' most typically enters into two
kinds of constructions: one, with intransitive subject (usually marked only on the verb
by prefix) and dative complement expressing that for which one is burning (wiya-wu 'for
water'); and one with intransitive subject, the experiencer, and instrumental complement
expressing that which is causing one to thirst or burn:(16)   nga-ba-n                    marninggani-yi
       ISG-burn-PRES               sun-INST
       'I'm burning in the sun'.
  Since ""sun"" can never show verbal agreement, it is regarded as Instrument rather than
transitive subject. Instrument thus marks the nominal that expresses the means by which
an action is accomplished, as distinct from the agent of the action, the transitive subject.
Other examples of Instrumental nominals are:(17)   badbad-ngana-yi          yirr(w)un-ga-n                        lurrbu     lagla-warr

       'You [NSG] douse it with water, douse [SG] the light with water, let only
       charcoal be there'.
  In this example, two approximate synonyms meaning ""douse, extinguish"" occur with
Instrumental-marked ""water"".

  In (19), the substance with which something is filled is treated as Instrument. The same

  ""Drown"", gun-ngu- (the inseparable AUX is that which, as free verb means
""consume""), is prefixed with 2NSG (irrealis prefixal form, see 6.6.3.) as intransitive
subject, and ""water"" marked as Instrument nominal. In construction with ""drown"",
""water"" has been found to occur as transitive subject:(21)   yingan-gun-ngu              wiya-yi

       'The man boomeranged yonder other man with a boomerang, and then he
       threw back at him'.
  (23) illustrates the occurrence within the same clause of overt Ergative-marked
transitive subject, and Instrumental noun.
  There is some functional overlap between Instrumental and Adverbial -barra (see
5.4.).","[88, 89, 90, 91, 92]"
"  It has also been mentioned (5.9.) that the notion of ""difference"" given by -gari tends
to be expressed pleonastically, in that it and the adjectival nominal of word rank,
yiwarnagari 'another, (a) different (one)' often occur in the same tone unit and phrase:(531)   nana            yiwarnagari         yibiyan-gari

        Ά different man/another man'.
  Noun phrases of two words are not uncommon. The following types are usual.
  DEM + N. The various closed classes of demonstrative words (see 7.2.) function to
contextualise the phrase, relating it to the linguistic or extralinguistic context, thus
specifying reference:

Immediate, Proximate or Remote with respect to the speech situation), in many instances
the Proximate category signals linguistic recoverability, i.e., that an item is being
presented as known or recoverable from the linguistic context (whether it has actually
been previously mentioned or not). Thus the Proximate category is most comparable in
English to the definite article, and two-word noun phrases consisting of Proximate
demonstrative and open-class nominal are very common:(534)   nana gangman              'the kangaroo'
(535) nan-gu marluga-wu           'to/for the old man'

                              a  For each stop, there is a corresponding nasal. There are five stop-nasal series (as in
neighbouring Mangarrayi, Merlan 1982; and Wardaman's congeners Yangman and
Dagoman, but unlike Wakiman to the north which, as noted in Chapter 1, has only four
points of articulation, and lacks the distinction between apico-alveolar and apico-domal
series, Cook 1987: 24).
  The orthography is convenient in that it requires no special diacritics. However, the
digraph ng representing the velar nasal needs to be distinguished from the sequence
apical nasal plus velar stop , as in the word /dongo/ 'in a line'. In order to eliminate this
ambiguity, that combination is written with full stop separating the two segments: don.go.
This is not done at morpheme boundary, however, where the presence of hyphen is
sufficient to indicate that two distinct segments of different morphemes are involved,
e.g., yibiwan-gu 'man, person' (Dative).
12 Chapter 2    Word-finally, the palatal digraphs are inverted (ly is written as yl, and ny as yn),
 because this seems to make it easier for those who already read English to approximate
 the correct pronunciation.
    In Wardaman, the bilabial series involves true bilabial occlusion.
    In the apico-alveolar series, the active articulator is the tip of the tongue making contact
 with the alveolar ridge. For the apico-domal or retroflex consonants, the active
 articulator is the apex making contact in the pre-palatal region. It can be difficult to
distinguish phonetically between members of the two apical series, especially
 intervocalically. Here, even what turn out, upon close investigation, to be plain apical
consonants, may occasionally have a hint of retroflex vocoid on-glide. Also, what turn
out to be retroflex segments are often realized with relatively little phonetic retroflexion,
and this appears to be true in any position. Thus the apical series, across their realizations,
tend to be more similar to each other than in some other languages of the region. Despite
the problems sometimes posed by identification of the difference between corresponding
members of the two series, and even despite a certain tendency towards harmonic
phonetic ""spread"" of retroflexion to other apical consonants in the word following a
retroflex one (perhaps similar to a phenomenon identified in Wakiman by Cook 1987:
26-29, see 3.7.3.), there can be no doubt of the phonological status of the distinction in
Wardaman.
   For the production of lamino-palatals, the tongue is laterally spread, with the tip of the
tongue touching the back of the lower teeth, the blade the alveo-palatal region. Lateral
spread of the tongue is particularly noticeable in the (rather rare) realizations of the
lamino-palatal lateral ly before peripheral stops and glides. All three laterals are voiced
bilateral approximants.
   The velar series is dorso-palatal.
   Of the two rhotics, the apico-alveolar /rr/ is a tap, never a trill. The glide Irl is a post-
alveolar approxirnant. There is no question of the phonemic distinctness or positional
neutralization of the rhotic contrast in Wardaman, Yangman, and Dagoman. But here
again a signal difference with Wakiman must be noted: there, the rhotic contrast
minimally distinguishes few forms, and the tap rhotic in that language has a variant which
is phonetically indistinguishable from the post-alveolar glide (Cook 1987: 29).
   /w/ is a voiced bilabial frictionless continuant, with rounding noticeable before /u/ and
Ιοί. However, before /u/ in the noun class prefix /wu/, there may be very little to no
noticeable lip-rounding or protrusion, such that the realization of this sequence is [u].
Likewise, the voiced vocoid /y/, normally produced with considerable lateral tongue
spread and approximation of blade and mid-tongue to palate, may exhibit a minimal
degree of these articulatory features word-initially before the high front III. This is
frequently the case in the realization of the higher animate noun class prefix /yi/, as [/'],
but much less so of pre-/i/ realizations elsewhere (e.g., in such words as yilgbayi 'all
right, enough'). The correct generalization seems to be that where the conditions are met
for higher and tenser realization of/i/, there may be minimal realization of the semivowel.
Where, however, (as in yilgbayi, with its closed first syllable), there is [/] realization of
the vowel, there tends to be fuller realization of the semivowel. And it is precisely in its
morpho-phonological occurrences as noun class prefix that the former conditions (for
                                                                        Segmental phonology 13
higher and tenser realization of the vowel, see below on vowel allophony) are most often
met. Since there is no other compelling evidence for a contrast between /yi/ and /i/
morpheme-initially, nor, indeed, any independent evidence for vowel-initial morphemes
(save one α-initial one) in the language, this can apparently be treated as a specialization
in the noun class morphemes.
  The vowel /i/ is realized as a high, front, maximally tense [/] in open syllables, and
particularly before the palatal segments /j/, /ny/, /ly/, both semivowels, and also the rhotic
/rr/, as in the following examples (in some, more than one condition is met):
      [ 'warrija ]      'alligator'
      [ 'lidi ]         'long-horned grasshopper'
      [li'warrga ]      'ground sugar bag'
      [ 'girrgilang ]   'galah'
      f 'ginyang ]      catfish species
      [ 'ginydan ]      'stone spear point'  In the last form above, the high and tense vowel quality is the main auditory cue
signalling the palatal articulation of the following nasal, which before the stop normally
evidences no palatal off-glide.
  The /i/ vowel is realized as slightly lower and less tense in closed syllables:
      [ 'munln ]        'rock cod'
      [ 'mardlrd ]      'whistling kite'
      [yllg'bayi]       OK, enough'   There are morphemes with phonetic long [/':], sometimes also realized as a diphthong
[if]. This appears to be best regarded as the sequence /iyi/, which can be shown to contrast
with /i/ in an otherwise very similar environment. The following two forms illustrate
this contrast between such a long vowel, and a fairly high, tense but short /i/:
      \ji:la}           'well'                   /jiyila/
      \jila ]           originative suffix       /jila/  There are other examples for which no minimally or sub-minimally distinct form can
be cited, e.g., [bi:marla], /biyimarla/ 'inflate'.
  There is a parallel to the above in the length of the vowel, and syllable reduction, in the
verb particle [du:], also realized as [duU] 'to raise' (with auxiliary bu-), in the noun [lu:n]
'cave', in the noun [ngu:n] 'faeces', in the particle [buUdba] 'cook under ashes', the
noun stem [muUdban] 'wet soil'. In all cases we must recognize the combination of
/uwu/ in accounting for the phonetic length of the vowel: /duwu/, /luwun/, /nguwun/,
/buwud-ba/, /mu-wudban/ (the latter apparently with nominal class marker showing fixed
assimilation to the first stem vowel).
  In contrast with the above V\ + homorganic glide + Vi sequences, combinations with
vowel and heterorganic glide, [iwi] and [uyu], tend to remain clearly syllabified, or may
be only slightly reduced ([yi-ngawuyu] 'wife', [miwinin] 'camp, sleep').
14 Chapter 2  /e/ is realized as a mid front unrounded, and fairly lax vowel [e] in closed syllables,
except before palatal segments, where it tends to be at its highest and tensest It may be
slightly higher and tenser in open syllables, including word-finally, but not cardinal [e]:     ['bedbog ]                   'honey eater'
     ['nienjen ]                  'cheeky'
     [ gej ]                      ' ask' (particle)
     ['nienyje]                   'to feel, hold, grasp'
     [ tiK'gernnan ]              Dioscorea sp.
     [ yinge 'we]                    might fall'
     [ jenibe ]                   ' death adder'  In almost all environments lot is realized as a mid to slightly lower rounded vowel [o].
It is slightly higher than mid in the environment of /w/, but is nowhere cardinal [o].     [mo'gorlgorl ]              Anipelocissus sp.
     [ 'nyob o ]                  ' marsupi al mouse'
     ['ngorrogorro ]              'afternoon'
     ['nsno'iiwrran ]            personal name
     ['nonggs ]                  'too, also' (cf. [nungguru ] 'hand')  The distinction between realizations of/o/ and/u/ can be difficult to identify, but clearly
bears a considerable functional load in lexical stems.
  The usual realization of /u/ is [U ], in closed syllables. It is slightly higher and tenser
in open syllables, including word-finally, and before palatal segments:     [wi'liwiiga ]                'stone curlew'
     ['bUlyan}                    'eagle'
     [nuirru 'jUnnian ]           ' sand frog'
     [ 'naribu ]                  ' freshwater mussel'  Under primary stress in open syllables, /a/ is realized as maximally open, [a.]; in other
open syllables it is regularly realized as slightly more centered [a], and this is
approximately its 'elsewhere' realization, except before apicals, where it is slightly
fronted, somewhere between [a] and [ce\.     \gu 'lirrida ]              ' peew ee'
     [ 'ga. läwärrä ]            ' plumed pigeon'

     \ja'ntardba ]               'rainbow fish'
                                                                      Segmental phonology 15
2.2. Distributional restrictions: VowelsVowels do not occur morpheme-initially in Wardaman, except in the tag-question particle
ale (this is one of the few Wardaman words often produced with an audible, final glottal
constriction, indicative of the intensity of the tag question syntagm 'is that so?'). It was
noted above that the noun class prefixes /wu/ and /yi/, i.e., with homorganic semivowel
and vowel, are commonly realized as [u] and [/]. In other such word-initial combinations,
the glide tends to remain unreduced, or somewhat less so; and the semivowel is not
reduced in initial combination with non-homorganic vowel:
     [Vw/τεη]         'child'
     ['wUjbln]        'greedy'
     [yu'gUrni]       'more, again'
  However, there is some variation, and there are some words, like /wuja/ 'fire, wood',
which appear to be commonly realized in both ways. In that word, it is likely the /wu/
is etymologically the noun class prefix, synchronically however to be analyzed as part
of the root. Leaving aside the matter of the noun class prefixes, and other instances of
word-initial /wu/ and /yi/ which may vary somewhat in degree of realization of the
semivowel, there is, as noted in 2.1., no cause to recognize vowel-initial morphemes in
Wardaman. The difference between morpheme-initial glide plus homorganic vowel, and
vowel alone, is environmentally limited (i.e., most common in the nominal class
markers), and never minimally distinctive. The absence or infrequency of vowel-initial
morphemes is also characteristic of a number of neighbouring languages, including
Mangarrayi, Yangman, and Jawoyn. Slightly further east, we find a very limited range
of α-initial morphemes in Alawa (Sharpe 1972) and Ngalakan (Merlan 1983: 11). In
Wardaman, there are a few inflectional morphemes that have the shape C (e.g., present
tense suffix -n, but none consists only of V, or has initial V.
  As noted in 1.3., the mid-vowels do not occur in any of the inflectional morphology,
which exhibits a three-vowel system, a, i, and u. There is, however, no lack of surface
mid-vowels in inflectional morphs, due to phonetic processes of assimilation (3.7.3.).
Among derivational morphemes and lexical suffixes, too, the mid-vowels are rare, but
there are instances, such as adverbial /beng/, expressing location or place where. The
mid-vowels are widely distributed over lexemes, and there is no particular evidence of
""defective"" distribution with respect to any word class. Though /a/, /i/ and /u/ are more
common finally than the mid-vowels, there are nonetheless quite a number of examples
of Id and /o/ finally, e.g.,: bone 'across'; ngajamberle, proper name; lowe, toponym;
bogo 'lend', jewele 'close, near', wume 'sky', modborrongo, proper name; and
inflectional forms of quite a number of verbs.
  Examples of minimal and sub-minimal vowel contrasts are:
     jin(ma)          'blame'
     jen(ma)          'cut into pieces'
     juny(ma)         'set' (of sun, celestial body)
     jongma-          'to kiss'
     jangma-          'to defecate'
16 Chapter 2
  There are no vowel clusters.
  See 3.7.3. for further remarks on distribution of the mid-vowels.","[35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40]"
"7.6.7. Secondary adverbsA few common adverbs are worthy of mention as ""secondary"", that is derived from
basically adverbial forms by means of nominal case-suffixes. The processes involved
are not regular, but examples include: gurru-ya 'later', built from the adverbgiirru of
the same meaning by addition of the Locative case suffix; niarla-warr Over and over,
again', built from what is elsewhere (8.13.) an iterative verbal suffix by means of the
Allative case-suffix; andyijarlu-warr 'sometimes', built from the adjectival nominal
stemyijarlu 'some', again with the Allative suffix.

  Categories of the finite verb, and the verb in the clause
8.1. Introduction: Verbal construction typesThere are two common types of verbal construction in Wardaman. One has as its main
constituent a finite verb which by itself expresses the lexical verbal content of the clause.
It carries pronominal adjuncts in keeping with the transitivity structure of the clause
which the verb partly instantiates, and marking for a number of verbal categories
including tense-mood-aspect, and possibly others such as subordination. Finite verbs
may be divided into a number of different formal types, based on shape and analyzability
(see following).
  The second kind of construction is one which consists of a verb particle and inflecting
verb. The verb particle, an interesting, multi-functional part of speech, is the basis of
formation of a number of types of adclausal complements (see 11.4.). But for the moment
we will consider it only as part of the verbal construction. In such particle+ finite verb
structures, often most of the lexical verbal content of the clause is associated with the
particle, while the lexical contribution of the finite verb may vary. We might think of the
possible internal relation of particle and finite verb as a spectrum, with variation along
it in terms of the semantic specificity versus generality of the verb. Where the verb is
highly general, it may seemingly contribute only to specification of the transitivity of the
clause, but very little to lexical meaning. Where the verb is semantically more specific
and transparent in combination with the particle, it contributes both to the specification
of transitivity in the clause, and to lexical meaning in a more readily analyzable way.
  Most particles tend to be fairly specialized in their co-occurrence, that is, they occur
with only one or a small number of inflecting verbs. But combinations tend to differ in
the extent to which the meaning contributions of particle and verb can be assessed. An
example is birdij, which in material recorded has been found with only two inflecting
verbs. Its combination with the CV- root gi-, yields the meaning 'find, locate'. In
construction with the CV- root na-, it means 'to espy, to find' (as, in the terms of
Australian Aboriginal child-spirit concepts, a father or other relative is said to ""find"" a
child, see Merlan 1986). Such examples present themselves more or less as idioms with
respect to given meanings, in that the contribution to meaning cannot be neatly
apportioned as between particle and finite verb. But such combinations have some
degree of semantic transparency that can be assessed by looking at the meaning the finite
verb may have as sole constituent of a verb phrase, and by comparing the various pairings
of the particle with other finite verbs.
  Most of the finite verbs that occur in such combinations as birdij gi- can occur by
themselves as the main constituent in verbal constructions of the first type discussed
above; and from their occurrence there, an independent lexical meaning can be
established. By itself, the verb gi- means 'to put'; and na- 'to see'. We can therefore
172 Chapters appreciate that with respect to the combination birdij gi-, the second combination birdij
 na- may be analyzed as 'finding by seeing', or the like. But there seems to be no revealing
 way to further analyze the relationship between birdij and gi- in semantic terms.
    In other cases of limited co-occurrence of particle with finite verbs, we may speak more
 confidently of the semantic contribution and relation to each other of the constituents.
 For instance, the particle gayardung 'run' may occur with verbs of motion ya- 'go' and
 nyanga- 'come', but we are able to say that the particle expresses a manner of movement,
 while the finite verbs differ in directionality.
    It is not usual for a particle to commonly occur with more than several different finite
 verbs. An important grammatical feature that such alternative combinations may
 contribute to, or directly instantiate, is transitivity at the clause level. For example, the
 particle birriwirlib 'roll, tumble' with either main motion verb, 'go' or 'come' may only
 occur as part of an intransitive clause structure. However, with either wudba- (which by
 itself means 'to throw') or bu-, the combination can only occur within a transitive clause
 structure (with appropriate pronominal adjuncts, etc.). There are many ways in
Wardaman that such intransitive/transitive pairs or sets with the same verb particle are
 implemented, and sometimes here an (at least partial) semantic compatibility between
particle and co-occurring finite verb can be discerned by examining the set of possible
pairings into which each particle may enter (as above, the two pairings with birdij). For
instance, two common combinations into which the particle bard enters are: bard wudba-
 'throw down', and bard we- 'fall down'. From this can be discerned some of the
semantic components associated with bard rather than with the finite verb, i.e., trajectory
downwards. In another example, we find the combinations barlarra gi- 'to hide', and
barlarrajingi- 'to hide, be in hiding', where the lexical semantics of the finite verbs ('to
put' and 'to be, sit' respectively) are expanded into the difference between transitive and
intransitive clause structures. Compare the different possibilities of pairing with bod-ba
 'visit': with na- 'see', it means 'to visit'; with nyanga- (otherwise 'to come') the pair
means 'come to visit', and with lawu- (otherwise 'to reach, get to, catch up to, fetch'),
something like 'visit with'.
   There are many instances where alternative pairing does not change transitivity value,
but rather subtly alters verbal semantics. The particle birrij-ba with bu- (by itself, 'hit,
strike') means 'to knead'; but with me- (otherwise, 'to get') means 'to stir'. Both finite
verbs determine transitive clause-level structures. Similarly, bag-ba with ya- (by itself
 'to go') may be translated simply 'to break'; but with we- (ordinarily, 'to fall') may be
translated 'fall and break, break in falling'. Both of the finite verbs here instantiate
intransitive clause structures.
   So far most of the examples have involved pairings in which the particle appears more
specialized than the finite verb in its lexical semantics. We may say this on the basis that
verbs like gi- and bu- occur in combination with many different particles, and in many
instances the semantic contribution of the verb amounts to little more than the
specification of general type of action, or minimally, determination of the transitivity of
the clause. There are, however, pairings with what might be described as semantically
more specific lexical verbs, which co-occurring particles seemingly further qualify. Here
the verbs contribute not only transitivity, but a more specialized lexical meaning. An
                                                                   Categories of the finite verb 173
example in point in the verb bewe- 'to step on, tread upon', which has been found paired
with particles bengmarla in the meaning 'to snap, break', and gilywaj in the meaning 'to
trample'. See 8.19. for more detailed examination of causativization and other transitive/
intransitive pairings.
  Insofar as a finite verb appears to only specify transitivity and contribute little to
predicate semantics, it is convenient to consider it an ""Auxiliary"" verb. In interlinear
glosses, many finite verbs in particular constructions are so labelled. However, as we
have seen, there is a variable degree to which finite verbs in particle* verb constructions
may be defined as having only an auxiliary function. Partly by examining alternative
pairings with the same particle, additional degrees of predicate function and semantic
contribution can be discerned.
  It can also be seen that particles function to specify verbal semantics. The more fully
they do so, the more limited they are in their possible pairings with finite verbs. The
more generalized they are semantically, the greater are their possibilities of co-occurrence
with a variety of lexical verbs. There is a point at which we want to call the more general
modifiers ""adverbs"", and as has already been indicated at several places in this
description, there is no absolute line that can be drawn in Wardaman between verb
particles and adverbs — both, for example, can form adclausal complements, but the
latter are more limited in this respect. It is, however, useful to recognize a general
difference between the two word-classes in the terms given.
  Finite verbs fall into several different formal classes. There is a small but very
important set of 15 or 16 CV roots (see 8.16.), all of these are of high frequency both as
independent verbs, and most also as auxiliaries or supporting predicates in particle+ verb
constructions. These are ba- 'burn, thirst', bu- 'hit', ga- 'take', gi- 'put', la- 'bite', lu-
'cry', me- 'get', na 'see', ni- 'bring', nge- 'sing', ngu- 'eat, consume', we- 'fall', wo-
'give', να- 'go', yo- 'spear', and yu-, copula (see 8.20.). The verb ""go"" is so irregular
that it is not particularly useful to classify it as a CV- root, hence the alternative 15 or 16.
  There are finite verbs of two syllables which are morphologically unanalyzable, or
monomorphemic. Examples are bewe- 'tread on', buju- 'to dig', gaju- 'to rise, grow',
gerle- 'to taste', gerne- 'to take away from'; gewu- 'to shoo, chase away', gila- 'to water,
douse', ginye- 'to cook'Jingi- to sit', linyje- 'to cut', megbe- 'to snap' golo- 'to laugh
at', menyje- 'to feel', mowo- 'to steal', ngenyje- 'to choke', nyanga- 'to come', waja-
'to leave', yana- 'to do, say', yeli- 'to call out', and yonga- 'to farewell'. Some of these
show a suggestively similar final syllable, e.g., the final -(ny)je- in linyje- 'cut', menyje -
'feel', and ngenyje- 'choke', indicating that this may be historically analyzable.
  Some verbs of two syllables, and all of three syllables or more, are morphologically
analyzable into two parts, a variable initial element and a small set of inseparable, final
auxiliary-like elements. These include the pairs -ma and -ba which are in complementary
distribution depending on the stem-final element; -wu and -bu, also in complementary
distribution; a small number of verbs with final element -ma, suggesting that this also
may be historically separable; a small number of verbs with final syllable -rla some of
which contrast with verbs which lack this element, and on the basis of which the final
syllable may be seen as a transitivizing element; and a few verbs which contain a final
syllable ->·/- (post-nasal -ji-), identical with what is elsewhere the reflexive-reciprocal
174 Chaptersmarker, but which here must be defined as a formal marker of a small class of
mediopassive verbs.
  Where the syllable -ma occurs, the initial element may be analyzed as ending in any
segment but a stop; the shape -ba follows stops. Examples are: giirrg-ba- 'sleep',
gayg-ba-' shout', barlirrg-ba-' sweep', bidbid-ba-' twirl firedrill', borlorrod-ba-' spread
o\A\jongorog-ba- 'yawn' Jornog-ba- 'fill up', lorrod-ba- 'sharpen', mowoj-ba- 'sneak
away', wud-ba- 'throw'; yerrb-(b)a- 'be ashamed', yid-ba- 'sharpen', andyurrg-ba-
'feel'. Examples with final -ma- axe:jong-ma-' kiss' Jorl-nia-' kick', nmrndi-nia-' mind,
look after', newerr-tna- 'be hungry', nginy-nta- 'help', ngorr-nia- 'grind', ngunyang-
ma- 'knead', warrang-nia- 'swear', warrgany-ma- 'mess up', born-nia- 'bathe, wash',
and others. This final syllable, -ba or -nia, is probably to be seen as historically relatable
to the final particle suffix of the same allomorphy (11.1.2.). Such a relationship is
supported by the fact that there are some forms with this final syllable which are inflecting
verbs, or alternatively may function as verb particles, e.g., finite ngorlog-ba-, and particle
ngorlogba; or inflecting born-nia-, and particle bornborn 'bathe'.
  The shape-ΗΊί occurs after non-nasal sonorants, while -bu occurs after stops and nasals.
Examples of each are: bel-wii- 'slice', jewu- 'show', lawn- 'get, fetch, reach'; versus
lid-bu- 'sew', /wr/z-im- 'make^yerrenggej-bii- 'rummage, make a mess of, jarram-bu-
'look iar'Jinjin-bu- 'give work to, lay tasks upon', dem-bu- 'peck at'. Historically, this
final element is probably to be related to the finite independent verb bu-, but cannot be
synchronically identified with it, as their past tense suffixes differ (e.g., bel-wu-rri 'he
sliced it' versus bu-ndi' he hit it').
  The few verbs which end suggestively, for the purposes of historical analysis, in -rna
are: jomarna- 'to finish off, ledbarna- 'see', and wojbarna- 'listen'. This may be
relatable to na- 'see'.
  The verbs which end in -rla, some of which also contrast with stems which lack the
final syllable, are the following:
gayg-ba-        'call out'(intransitive) vs.       gayg-ba-rla-     'call out to'
biyima-rla-     'inflate' (transitive)
dagba-rla-      'have' (transitive)
wema-rla-       'vomit' (something) vs.            wentiyi-         'vomit'
  The small class of verbs called semantically ""Mediopassive"", and which are
constructionally intransitive, includes a number which do not contrast with a paired
transitive verb, but a small number that do, however, as follows.
jawe-yi-        'be tired'
lo-yi-          ' dance'
jerri-yi-        'be cold'
la-yi-           'die'
garrany-jiyi-   'grow'
worlgbi-yi-     'work for, do work for'vs.         worlg-ba-        'roil'
burla-yi-        'lie, tell lies, be a liar' vs.   burla-ma-        'lie to'
wali-yi-        'be jealous of               vs.   wali-na-         'be jealous towards'
wenuyi-         'vomit'                   vs.      weniarla-        'vomit' (something)
                                                                 Categories of the finite verb 175  This element must evidently be seen historically as related to the reflexive-reciprocal
marker, which intransitivizes the predicate where subject and object are co-referential or
overlap, to create a formally intransitive clause. The segmentation of the form ""to grow""
is tentative, for it appears that there has been doubling of the mediopassive element.
  A final, isolated final syllable is equivalent to the CV verb ""to consume"", and occurs
ingun-ngu- 'drown'.","[193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199]"
"  The purposive forms are derived, respectively, from mediopassive jomarna- 'finish
up', linyje- 'cut', gurrgba- 'sleep', and bu- 'hit, kill'.
  It is interesting that often, informants would add overt Dative suffix to such Purposive
forms, as in (679):
                                             Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements 281

      hit-PURP-DAT                 3NSG-come-PST
        'They came to kill [him]'.
  They also accepted as approximately equivalent in meaning such pairs as nge-ye-ma
and nge-yi-yin 'for singing, in order to sing'; jabulma-ye-ma andjabulmi-yin 'in order
to smoke'; ngorlogba-ye-ma and ngorlogbl-yin 'in order to talk'; barlirrgba-ye-ma and
barlirrgbi-yin 'in order to sweep, clear'; gardbu-ye-ma and gardbu-yin 'in order to wipe'.
There were a number of verbs for which informants would produced or approve a -yin
Purposive form, but not a -ye-ma one, including: worlorl-mi-yin 'to fill', but not
*worlorlma-ye-ma (or any variant thereof); dagbarla-yin 'to have' but not *dagbarla-
ye-ma. This would seem to suggest the -ye-ma construction is less, current and
productive.","[304, 305]"
"
113. Nominalization of finite verbs
Complement-forming case suffixes are added directly to particles (see sections 11.4. -
11.8.) without any formal mark of derivation. Finite verbs, too, may form some of the
same complement types, but in order for them to do so they must be suffixed with a formal
272 Chapter 11
 mark of nominal derivation, added to the verb stem. Before non-zero case suffixes, the
 form of this suffix is -yi-, e.g., the finite stemjarrambu- 'look for' has the derived stem-
 formjarrambu-yi- to which further suffixes Locative, Ablative, Allative, and Source may
be added. These complement types are discussed in following sections, along with
comparable particle complements. There are four further considerations here.
   First, it should be noted that this process of nominalization is thorough-going: no finite
verbs have been found which cannot be nominalized in this way. Thus we have bu-yi-
 'hitting', gi-yi- 'putting', gaju-yi- 'arising', yo-yi- 'spearing', and so on.
   Second, finite verbs with final syllable -ba or -ma undergo vowel assimilation (and
sometimes also contraction) when the nominalizer is added to the vowel-final stem.
Thus, /gurrg-ba-yi-/ from 'sleep' is realized as gurrg-bi- or gurrg-bi-yi to which any non-
zero suffixes are added; /jabul-ma-yi-/ from 'smoke' as jabul-mi- or jabul-mi-yi and so
on.
   Third, the 'mediopassive' verbs, which have -yi- as part of the stem (e.g., /jawe-yi-/ 'be
cold', do not add a further syllable of this shape, but have the nominalized stem of the
same shape, to which non-zero suffixes are added, e.g., from mediopassive lo-yi- 'dance',
the Allative-suffixed nominalized form lo-yi-warr.
   Fourth, the syntactically most elaborate complement type that is formed with
nominalized stems, in that there is greatest retention of argument structure within the
complement clause, is the Purposive one (11.4.). For particles, Purposive complements
are formed with the suffixation of Dative ending directly to the particle, without a formal
mark of derivation. Finite verbs, however, have a Purposive complement stem of the
shape -yin. There are many instances in which this ending is suffixed to the nominalizer
-yi- with no modification, e.g. the Purposive complement of finite verb yo- 'spear' is
yo-yi-yin. However, the sequence -yi-yin undergoes contraction in many cases to just
[y/n], although this sometimes leaves a mark elsewhere in altered stem-vocalism. For
example, the verb ginye- 'cook' has Purposive form ginyiyin 'for cooking', and the
change in final stem-vowel quality from e to / must be understood as the contraction of
/ginye-yi-yin/ to the actually occurring form. A mark is also left in verb with final syllable
-ba or -ma; e.g., in (671) below, the Purposive form of lorrodba- 'grind' occurs as
lorrodbi-yin, which must be understood as the contraction of /lorrod-ba-yi-yin/. Other
α-final roots, however, do not undergo this change in vocalism, but may still exhibit
surface contraction of the nominalizer and purposive suffix, e.g., \jejbarla-yin].
   The complement type with Purposive-marked predicate verb can have a semantic
object, which must be put in Dative case; thus the transitive case structure in these
complement types is Absolutive-Dative, as described further and illustrated in 11.4.","[295, 296]"

clauses also occurs here with 3SG object; and likewise that the 2NSG person marker
                                                Independent pronouns and person-marking in the verb 135
which occurs in intransitive clauses, here occurs with 3SG and 3NSG objects. Now we
may summarize the significance of the occurrence of this 2SG -ni- person element in the
2SG          >1EX NSG and 2NSG               >1EX NSG combinations of the transitive
indicative paradigm. It comes from the irrealis paradigm, and fills in those contested
combinations (again, see Heath 1976) of the transitive paradigm in which 2 person acts
on 1. (In other languages the 1        >2 forms may be equally problematic.) On a scale
of graduated transitivity values of verbal categories, irrealis would probably have to be
considered lower in transitivity than the indicative mood (and the precise justification
for this in Wardaman will emerge in Chapters 8 and 9, where the uses and meanings of
irrealis are discussed; see also Hopper and Thompson 1980). To fill out what are often
problematic categorial combinations in the transitive paradigm, Wardaman has recourse
to formal elements of the less highly transitive irrealis one.9
  In Table 10, remaining differences from the indicative consist in the fact that, before
1EX NSG person element >'/- as subject and object, and before the 2SG object element
yim in 3SG/NSG            »2SG the irrealis marker does not consist of yi-, or in the latter
case, of yayi-, but of να-. Another irregularity of the irrealis forms is that 2SG/
NSG           »1EX NSG forms were found not to be distinguished from the indicative
forms.","[158, 159]"

4. For purposes of the count, the particle suffix was not considered to form part of any stem, but
   derivational, stem-forming affixes (such as noun-forming -ban ~ -man) were considered part
   of stems, and inseparable verbal auxiliaries were considered part of verb stems. Forms derived
   from a counted base form, whatever their structure, were not separately counted. The
   implications of the above are as follows: a verb particle such as nyerreng-ma 'make noise' was
   tallied as an all e stem. Derived forms such as nyerreng-ma-wujban 'noisy person' were not
   included in the count. Different bases for a count could validly be used, but the count as given
   at least affords some idea of relative vowel frequencies, and of the rather high incidence of forms
   which contain only one mid-vowel or the other.
46 Chapters3.8. ReduplicationThere is a considerable amount of non-productive or frozen lexical reduplication in
Wardaman, i.e., there are many words the basic form of which is reduplicative. These
include, for example, such particles as gijigijig 'tickle', mamajmamaj 'wave (to)',
dangdangma 'click', wujugwujug 'shake' (as tree, to dislodge animal or fruit), jibjib(a)
'itch', bornborn 'bathe', gajigaji 'walk, travel on foot', burrngburrng-ma 'boil', and so
on. Numerous examples could be cited among nouns. We will not consider such forms
here, but turn to productive processes of reduplication.
  First, however, it may be mentioned here that word- and even phrase-level repetition
is a common means for indicating repetitive, intensive, or distributive activity. Consider
the following examples:
       jarrug yirr-me-ndi               jamam jamam            yi-bumbu-gari
       egg        lEXNSG-get-PST        full  full             YI-billy-other-ABS
       yi-bumbu-gari
        YI-bill-other-ABS
        'We gathered eggs, full, full, another billycan, another billycan ...'.
  Here, in order to convey the impression of durative and repetitive activity and outcome,
the speaker repeats both ""full"" and the phrase ""another billy"".
  Other examples of word-level repetition are:
       wurren         yi-jad     yi-jad,          yi-jarlu         wudu     wudu
       child-ABS      YI-big     YI-big-ABS       YI-some-ABS      small    small-ABS
       'some big big children, some little little ones ...'.       lege-ya          yum-nya             0-jingi-ndi        walig       walig
       one-LOC          tree-LOC            3SG-sit-PST        around      around
       'It was (there) all around a single tree ...'.
  Here to give the impression of multiplicity, the speaker repeats the locational 'around'.
Another common way of indicating iteration, duration, repetition as a feature of text is
by over-long articulation of the final vowel of a verb form on a single pitch level:
wurr-wemiyi-rri::: yilgbayi 'they kept on vomiting, (then they were) OK'. There also
exists an iterative suffix (see 8.13.).
  Here, we will not further consider word-level repetition or higher text-level
construction of iteration and related meanings, except to note that it is not possible to
make an entirely clear-cut distinction between word-level repetition, and what might
otherwise be seen as complete reduplication within the word. The difficulty of
distinguishing these two applies particularly to verb particles.
  Several kinds of reduplication are found with verb particles. There are many particles
for which complete reduplication is common, warlbag 'to remove, take off, unsaddle'
etc. is commonly reduplicated as warlbagwarlbag; dijong-ma 'play the didgeridoo' as
dijongdijong-ma (but also dijorrong-ma), ngurluguy(-ma) 'mumble' as ngurluguy
ngurluguy(-ma), mambang 'chase' as mambangmambang, barlb 'put down, in' as
                                                                         Process phonology 47barlbarlb (with degemination), duwu 'swell, grow' as duwuduwu, and so on. It is
possible to identify a complete reduplicative form as within the word, rather than word
repetition, where the particle-final suffix is commonly used with the particle, and also
appears in its reduplicative form (as with dijongdijong-ma, or barlbarlb-a 'put down,
in'). However, certain particles (like mambang) tend not to occur with particle-final
suffix, and their usual reduplicative forms do not either.
  Partial reduplications are also common in verb particles as well as other parts of speech.
There appears to be no canon of phonological shape on the basis of which one may strictly
predict which words will reduplicate fully, and which partially, but there are indications
of some possible conditioning factors.
  Certain words reduplicate partially, i.e., the first two syllables or CVC(C)V-, where
complete reduplication would result in otherwise rare consonant clusters (see 2.4.). Thus
the reduplicative form oflabang 'put on one's shoulders' is laba-rlabang, never complete
*labang-labang. (Note the cluster ng-l occurs rarely, and only across morpheme
boundary). And although reduplication of any type operates only upon words of two or
more syllables, those of more than two syllables tend to exhibit partial rather than
complete reduplication. Thus, the usual reduplication of the verb particle gayardung 'run'
is gaya-gayardung; that of adjectival nominal jaburrunggun 'antecedents,
predecessors', jajaburrunggun; that of yiguwarlangana 'single', yiguguwarlangana
(also yiguwarlangana-mulu).
  Several important minor and major reduplicative patterns need to be mentioned. There
are two high-frequency noun stems which consist entirely of open syllables: marluga
Old man' and mulurru Old woman'. These have very high-frequency reduplicative
forms marlarluga and mululurru. Only the first stem, which contains vowels of different
quality, provides insight into the process:
In other words, the reduplicative segment is ma-RLA-rlu-ga, a combination of €2 and the
preceding V^ So common is this pattern that only two instances have been found in a
search of extensive text material of the alternatively possible marluga-mulu Old men'
with plural suffix: the reduplicated form is more common by far. And although a few
instances of mulurru-mulu have been found, this is by far less common than mululurru,
even when the noun is case-suffixed (as in mululurru-yi, ERG). Another example of this
pattern is the reduplicative form ofwardirrg 'young girl', wardardirrg 'young girls'.
  That not all reduplications follow the above pattern (with reduplicative segment
composed of €2 and Vj) is shown by the common reduplicative form of jumba 'behind,
in back' : jumbamba. Here, the reduplicative segment is jum-iam-ba, or a combination
of CB and V2C2. This may be associated with words with first, closed syllable. Another
example of slightly variant kind is the reduplicative, functionally adverbial yondondorr
'along, on the road', derived from the noun yondorrin 'road'. Here, the reduplicative
segment is evidently d plus ViC 2 . Another form of this kind is walbalbamda On/along
a plain, flat place' from walbarndan 'plain'. Also from barrwa 'down', reduplicative
barrwarrwa should be considered of this kind.
48 Chapter3  Another minor pattern is attested in a few roots which have first two syllables of the
shape S VjR/LVj, that is, with initial stop (often b) followed by a sequence of two identical
vowels separated by rhotic or lateral. In such instances the reduplicative segment is of
the shape wUR/LM, as in the examples:

                                                                      YI-class

     marranyin                   marrawarrayn                      'sand'   The last reduplicative form, marrawarrayn, is used to describe plants and animals
 which ""belong to"", that is are indigenous to, sand country, such as various plum types,
 and so oa
   A few other forms have been found to have a similar but not identical internal segment.
 For example, there was noted above a form related to the particle dijong-nra 'play
 didgeridoo', dijorrong-nia.
   The most important of minor patterns is one in which the reduplicative segment (from
 which the copy is made) is bounded off from the reduplicated segment byg. This pattern
was found to occur with stems of the major word classes: nominal, verbal, and particle.
There are a number of unusual features and different possibilities in this process.
   There are some difficulties stating the domain or conditions of application of this kind
 of reduplication; some different attested types must at least be distinguished Where a
lexical stem is only bisyllabic, it often constitutes the input to reduplication. One case
is that otjiurndu 'short' (commonly ""short piece of cloth or material""), theg-form of
which is jurndug-jurndu. The high-frequency g-form of the verb burla- 'to lie to,
deceive' is burlag-burla; of durla- 'copulate with', ditrlag-durla; and so on. In a few
common instances where a lexical stem is monosyllabic, the reduplicating unit may
include a nominal class prefix as part of it. Reduplicating forms of the monosyllabic
adjectival nominal jad 'big' consist only of nominal class marker plus stem, ma-jad,
yi-jad etc. In this instance, the reduplicating unit is shown to be such bisyllabic
combinations of class marker plus stem: yijagyijad, tiiajagniajad, etc.
   Note that where such a bisyllabic unit has a final consonant, that segment does not
constitute part of the reduplicating unit but is zeroed The zeroing of stem-final d in
g-forms of ""big"", above, illustrates this. Another example is theg-form of the noun stem
yibarnang 'aunt': barnag-barnang. The occurring form shows that the stem-final nasal
is dropped
   Further evidence below will show that the reduplicative process does not always apply
to bisyllables in the way described; there is an alternative pattern.
  Where a stem is more than bisyllabic, examples show that either the final two syllables,
or penultimate and antepenultimate syllables may occur as the reduplicating unit. In the
first instance, the commong-form of the verb dagbarla- 'have' is dagbarlag-barla-. In
                                                                          Process phonology 49the second instance, the high-frequency g-form of the verb particle barlarra 'hide' is
barlag-barlarra. If the verb ""have"" were to reduplicate according to the second pattern,
it would yield dagbag-barla-. This sounded unusual to informants, and it never occurred
in text, while the form dagbarlag-barla- was found several times. The closed first
syllable of the root may be a factor in determining that the reduplicating segment is the
final CVCV, while there is no such limiting factor in the case of barlarra.
    There are both bisyllabic and trisyllabic stems in which the reduplicating segment
consists only of one CV unit plus g. There is no obvious structural explanation why these
reduplicate in this way, rather than as described above. For example, the bisyllable
warling 'initiand, charge' has g-form wagwarling. The reduplicating unit is the CV
syllable -wa- only, plus g. If this bisyllable (which shows no unusual stress pattern or
other obvious feature) were to reduplicate as above, it would yield warlig-warling.
Exemplifying the same pattern for a trisyllabic stem is yuwarrin 'poor fellow', with
g-form yuwagwarrin. Here again, the the penultimate CV syllable by itself constitutes
the reduplicating segment. Another noteworthy case of this sort is the g-form of
wilyangun 'boy, lad': wilyagjangun. Were this form to be entirely regular, this would be
wilyaglyangun. However, the palatal lateral, post-stop, is substituted by the
corresponding stop (see also some tabled forms below of e.g., g-form of me- 'to get', na-
'see').
   Let us now turn to a number of common nominal stems which happen to designate
personal statuses, and all have the shape CVCVCV(C), e.g., yingurla 'lad, single boy'.
In these, there appears a reduplicated CV syllable, that is of shape gV, to the right of the
base form's penultimate syllable: yingugurla. As the example shows, the V of the gV
syllable is that of the base form's penultimate syllable. Other examples of this kind are
listed below. What seems unusual here is that the reduplicated segment apparently is to
the right of the reduplicating unit, or segment, its source. In other examples we have
seen above it seems to be to the left. However, for reasons that will become clearer when
g- reduplication in certain high-frequency monosyllabic verb stems is considered, these
cases should not be regarded as anomalous in this way. Rather, the reduplication should
be seen as involving reduplication of the penultimate CV, plus g, yielding an hypothetical
intermediate form: yingugngurla. The cluster gng is simplified by zeroing of the nasal:
yingugurla. (The cluster gng is rare, and occurs only in reduplicative forms.) The analogy
with certain «-initial monosyllabic verb stems will be shown below. From that discussion,
it will become clear that the crucial feature of all the CVCVCV(C) examples is not their
syllabic structure per se, but the presence of (medial) ng.
   Wardaman's high-frequency CV verb stems also have g-reduplicative forms (see listing
below). The process is simple, involving here reduplication of the CV, plus g, the unit
occurring leftwards of its source. To illustrate with an inflected verb form and its
g-counterpart, we have: yawurr-bun 'they hit it', and yawurr-bugbun.
   It is apparent that such reduplication must be seen as operating upon already inflected,
or inflectionally specified, forms. This can be seen from the fact that basic /j-initial stems
have g-forms which show appropriate stopping of that nasal following nonsingular rr
(3.5.1.). For example, for the verb ni- 'to bring', the 3NSG form 'they bring it' is
yawu~din, the g-form yawu-digdin.
50 Chapters  For the verb na- 'to see', the corresponding singular and plural, regular and g-forms,
are as follows:
      'he sees it'    ya-nan        g-form      ya-nagdan
      'they see it'   yawn-dan      g-form      yawu-dagdan
  We might expect the 3SG g-form ya-nagdan to be *ya-nagnan. However, as we saw
above, a similar kind of process was found in the stopping of palatal lateral after g in
wilyagjangun 'lads'. We may generalize that post-g appears to be a stopping environment
for both apical nasals, and laterals. We also find the g-form of me- 'get', megbe-, rather
than *megme-. (It happens that there is a distinct bisyllabic root megbe- 'break, snap',
with which the g-form of me- is thus homophonous.)
  Finally, let us look at examples of CV verb stems which parallel the features of g-
reduplication in CVCVCV(C) nominal stems discussed above. There are two high-
frequency CV stems that being with ng, ngu- 'to eat', and nge- 'to sing1. These have g-
forms as follows (examples are 3NSG, but this is not significant here): yawurr-ngugun,
and yawurr-ngegen. We expect, by analogy with the majority of other examples above,
yawurr-ngugngun and yawurr-ngegngen. We see that such hypothetical forms parallel
the intermediate level form suggested above for yingugurla (yingugngurla). We may
regard all of these as more regular by positing that they all undergo simplification of the
(boundary-only) cluster gng to g.
  The listing of examples in Table 4 breaks the examples into categories by sub-type as
discussed above.
  The usual elements of meaning contributed by this process include plurality (yi-birrba
Old', yi-birrbagbirrba 'the old people, the ancestors'), and in the case of verbal stems,
intensity and/or repetition:
        0-yanggi-ya              jarrambu         lurleg-lurle          lurleg-lurle
        3SG-go-PST-NAR            look            cryrdp                cryrdp

        look          find               3SG-AUX-PST-NAR
       '[Bird] went around looking, crying and crying and looking, and found it'.
  In barnag-barnang, based on the kin term yi-barnang 'aunt', there is some indication
that the specific element of intensity is intimacy, closeness, affection. This example first
turned up in a story by a woman telling of her childhood and her close relationship with
several older women, including a grandmother and her aunt, who always took her on foraging
expeditions and taught her about foods and country. A slightly expanded context is:

52 Chapter3   Finally, a couple of minor verbal reduplications deserve mention. The verb 'go' has
a common, reduplicative present tense which means ""to go along slowly and/or
continuously"". It is identical to the normal present tense (see 8.16.), but has an additional,
final reduplicative segment -ja. Thus, Ί go, am going' is nganja, the reduplicative form,
nganjaja; \EXNSGyirr-ya and reduplicative yirr-ya-ja, and so on. The \erbyana- 'say,
do' has a reduplicative stem form yana-jana-, which means 'do and do, keep on doing,
saying'.","[69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76]"
"11.4.3. Allative-marked complements of purpose, intention and goal Both Allative and Source case categories have somewhat different syntactic distribution
 with complements built from finite verbs (nominalized), as compared to particle
 complements.
   As complements of verbs of motion, particles typically occur either with no suffix, or
 with Dative suffix, to express ""purpose for which"". A small number of particles and
 particle-like forms occur with no suffix in combination with verbs of motion, expressing
 purpose; and any objective argument is Dative-marked. Of this kind is the common form
jarrambu 'looking for, in search of, etymologically related to the finite \erbjarram-bu-:(680) jarrambu           ngarr-ya          layi-wu
       looking for       UNPL-go           game-DAT
        'Let's go look around for game'.(681) ngayugu            gala    nganjiji            jarrambu               gunga

      2SG-ABS              also           go            3SG-DAT                 look for
        'I'll try to go look for him
        you go look for him too'.
  Another common particle of this sort isgelngerre 'bludge, cadge'.
  The usual Absolutive-Dative clause-structure with the finite verb related to particle
jarrambu is illustrated by:(682)   0-jarram-bu-rri          gunga         dubuluj-(y)a                ngawun
        3SG-search-PST           3SG-DAT       bag-LOC                     nothing

        3SG-AUX-PST          3SG-DAT   fall-PS
        'She looked for it in her bag, nothing, it had fallen out on her'.
282 Chapter 11
  Otherwise, purpose with verbs of motion is usually expressed for particles with Dative
suffix:(683)    ngarr-ya           bornborn-gu
         UNPL-go           bathe-DAT
         'Let's go to wash/bathe'.(684)    ngarr-ya          worlog-ba-wu       yiwarlng-gu
         UNPL-go           wash-PS-DAT        clothes-DAT
         'Let's go wash clothes'.
  For particles, complements of GOAL may be Allative-marked. A small number of
textual examples show Allative-marked particles as goals of verbs of motion. The
following extended example, with surrounding context, illustrates this.(685a) nga-nji   lurrbu-ma              wirlin.gunyang-garr   lurrbu-yi 0-nyanga-ndi
       ISG-goFUT back-PS                [place]-ALL           back-ADV 3SG-come-PST   (b)    lurrbu-yi        0-nyanga-ndi       na      barlba-warr
          back-ADV         3SG-come-PST       [now]   go inside-ALL   (c)    wirlin.gunyang             barlb    0-we-ndi    na

          forever          [now]    dreaming-AB S
         Ί must go back to Wirlin.gunyang, and she came back.
         She came back to go inside/under [as dreaming].
         She went down as dreaming at Wirlin.gunyang
         and now is dreaming forever'.
  In (b), barlba-warr is Allative-marked goal complement of the verb of motion ""came""
(the passage describes the self-location in the landscape of rainbow serpent, the ""she"" of
the English translation). The particle barlb generally occurs with the finite verb we- in
the meaning 'go underneath, inside, become landform', used in the latter sense of
buwarraja 'dreamings', or creative mythic figures (as in line (c)). The Allative goal
complement with particles contrasts with the Allative particle complement of objects of
transitive main clauses (11.7.).
  Nominalized forms of finite verbs can be purposive complements of verbs of motion,
and they contrast with Purposive complement clauses in that they are suffixed with
Allative, rather than Dative, case:(686)    gurrg-bi-warr              nganja            yiwarna-warr    lagla-warr
         sleep-NOM-ALL              ISG-go-PRES       other-ALL       camp-ALL
         'I'm going to sleep in another place'.
                                             Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements 283  The nominalized predicate has the segmentation /gurrg-ba-yi-warr/. The entire motion
complement, including the nominal specifying place where, may be regarded as
syntactically subject to the Allative case-marking, as the following example also
illustrates:(687) jarrambu-yi-warr           mayi-warr            ngarr-ya
      search-NOM-ALL             food-ALL             UNPL-go
        'Let's go looking for food'.
  (687) is alternative to the construction type with particle jarrambu. The nominalization
of the finite verb must be Allative-marked, and the objective argument of the complement
clause must likewise be Allative-marked. Complement clauses tend to have sparse overt
argument structure, in which all constituents must be case-marked according to
complement type.
  The function of Allative in marking purpose complements, derived from finite verbs,
of verbs of motion, contrasts with its important and unusual function with particles,
described in 11.7.","[305, 306, 307]"
"11.1.3. Negative imperative particle constructionsPositive imperatives are not ordinarily formed using the particle alone (as is apparently
the case in Wakiman, see Cook 1987:255). Thus, one usually orders someone, notduba
'sit down!' with particle alone, but dubajingi 'sit down!', with particle plus finite verb.
While the particle may occur by itself as imperative, this apparently has the quality of a
truncated or elliptical utterance.
  Negative imperatives of particle plus finite verb constructions may be formed as usual,
that is, such constructions are identical to the Present Irrealis tense-mood-aspect forms:(646)    wonggo         duba      yi-ni-jingi-n
        neg             sit       IRR-2SG-AUX-PRES
        'Don't sit down!' 'You must not sit down!'.
                                              Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements 267  However, negative imperatives may be formed with particles alone, without any
nominal arguments, by suffixation of -gay ~ -way to the particle. These are apparently
rather forceful in tone, perhaps equivalent to the German past participial imperative
construction: Aufgestanden! The form is very rare in text material collected. Informants
produced elicitation examples both with and without the particle suffix:(647)   balyagbalyag-gay           nu-waja
        touch rdp-PNEG             2NSG-leave
        'No touching, you [NSG] leave him alone'.
  Note that the fact that the particle itself cannot be inflected for person means that,
though the addressees in (647) are nonsingular in the finite imperative form ""leave him!"",
number of the addressee is not specified in the particle. The force of the particle negator
appears to be to negate the action designated by the particle as a whole, ""No touching"".(648)   jajay-ma-way
        weak-PS-PNEG
        'No weakness!' 'Don't be weak!'.(649)   ngarral-ma-way
        shout-PS-PNEG
        'No shouting!' 'Don't shout!'.
  See 9.3. for the negation of nominalized finite verbs.","[290, 291]"
"8.15. Subordinate suffixationThere is a generalized subordinate clause type in Wardaman which fills both
""NP-relative"" and ""T(emporal)-relative"" functions (see Hale 1976 for discussion of this
generalized clause type in a number of Australian languages). Unlike a number of
languages of this region which have only this one generalized subordinate clause type
(see e.g., Merlan 1982 and 1983: 135; Heath 1981), Wardaman also has a range of other
kinds of adclausal constructions (Chapter 11).
  In Wardaman, subordination of one clause to another is signalled by means of two
suffixes. One, -n-ga, has non-past temporal reference and expresses imperfectivity of
the predicate to which it is suffixed in relation to the predicate of the linked clause; while
the other, -ny-ga expresses past temporal reference and perfectivity with respect to the
predicate of the linked clause. The suffixes are obviously bimorphemic and may be
analyzed as having a tense-marking element, followed by a common subordinate marker.
Each is suffixed to predicates which are otherwise no different from their normal form.(455)   marluga            gagung             berru
        old man-ABS        FF-ABS             [name]-ABS

        Old man my father's father Berru
        who had [was married to] my father's mother
        he sent that old man'.
  In (455), the first prosodic line names and identifies Berru; the second further describes
him by means of a past subordinate construction of which he is subject; the third continues
the earlier story-line concerning Berru's being sent on an errand. Note that the phrase
""old man grandfather Berru"" is Absolutive, in keeping with its function as direct object
of the predicate ""send"", rather than Ergative as it would normally be were the predicate
""have"" in a main rather than subordinate clause.(456)   ngan-ga-ndi                0-na-rri            tnagulu           dibid-ba

                                                                Categories of the finite verb 195(457)   nganburr-ga-ndi           go                  nan-gu              marluga-wu

        3SG-die-PST-SUB            [Delamere]
        'They took me to that old man, who died at Delamere'.
 The past subordinate clauses in (456) and (457) are both ad-nominal, the first modifying
magulu, the second, marluga.(458)   ngan-werreny-bu-rri         yarrirndi-yi     barrangardba            wu-warringun

        ISG-talk-PST-SUB
        'He ""sang"" [ensorcelled] me with yarrirndi, [so that] when I talked my throat
        was bad'.
  (458) illustrates the general subordinate clause function Hale (1976) calls ""T-relative"",
that is, one in which the subordinate clause is not ad-nominal, but rather modifies an
entire other clause, supplying some kind of background information.(459) barlba-wan        jarrambu 0-yanggi        barlb    yayi-we-ny-ga

  (459) is an account of the mythological trajectory of a dreaming figure which was
looking around for where it might situate itself in the landscape; note the past subordinate
predicate is Irrealis, indicating the uncertainty of its decision.(460) buuu             0-bu-ndi             galul-wa           wu-munburra           nana

        'Whoosh! it burst out from the top scattering that rock'.
  (460) is another subordinate clause of the T-relative type, specifying more closely the
situation that obtained as the main-clause action was accomplished.(461)   mowe         0-ga-ndi

         Europeans took it'.
  (461) is adnominal modifier of yijeng 'foot', the object of the main first and third
clauses. All examples so far have been of past subordinate forms, but present ones are
equally common:(462)    ngarl yawu-da-n           ngamanda-warda yilama yibiyan    yilama

        'Whatever are they barking at? maybe a man, maybe a cow, coming down to
         water is what they're barking at'.
  In (462) the clause ""corning to water"" contains present subordinate verb which modifies
each of the suggested possibilities. Mention of the dogs' barking is taken up again in a
further linked clause, marked with the important textual linking suffix -wan (see
12.3.7.).
  A subordinate verb-form may be further suffixed with the adverbial specifier of place
-beng ~ -weng, to create a modifying clause of ""place where"":(463)   0-waja-rri          waj     jumba      julu-ya          baraj          nana

        'He left it a long way away behind the hill, where he shot the kangaroo'
 (Note assimilation of the α vowel of -ga to the following mid-vowel.)
 The adverbial ending may also be suffixed to a nominal head, and a subordinate clause
modify it:(464)   nga-gurrgba-yan yimiyan-beng           nga-da-ny-ga             yi-guwarlangana
        ISG-sleep-POT same-SSPEC               UNPL-see-PST-SUB         YI-buffalo-ABS
        Ί might sleep in the same place where we saw the buffalo'.
 Alternatively, a clause (as in 463) may be subordinate to a nominal head of location,
with a subordinate clause suffixed with -beng modifying it:(465) nga-nyanga-n                nan-ba   megerrman         ngarr-buju-ny-ga-weng

        'I'm coming from where we dug yam'.
  In elicitation, informants produced examples with both Allative and Locative inflection
of subordinate clauses, for example:
                                                                Categories of the finite verb 197(466)   gangman            ngo-yo-ny-ga-warr     nan-garr                 nganjigbe

  There are clauses within certain kinds of constructions, and particular verbal categories,
which generally may be seen as providing kinds of background information to main
clauses, and it is common in Wardaman (but not obligatory) for such clauses to exhibit
subordinate marking. The first construction of this kind which deserves mention is the
conditional one (past and present). The protasis, or ""if — clause, generally introduced
by or containing the particle bujun (see 12.2.2.), may be seen as providing background
information in the sense that it specifies the conditions under which that which is
designated by the apodosis will obtain. The protasis is often formally a subordinate
clause, as the following examples show:(468) bujun yi-ngan-yana-ny-ga           yiwama                           wiyan
      if       IRR-3SG/lSG-teIl-PST-SUB  other-ABS                        rain-ABS
      yiyalang      yi-ngang-mam-bu-rri
      inform         IRR-1SG/2SG-AUX-PST
        'Had he told me last wet season I would have told you'.
  The predicate of the protasis, ""had he told me"", is formally subordinate, indicating its
linkage, as condition, to the formally independent apodosis which specifies what the
outcome would have been. Another example of this kind is:(469) bujun      yi-ngon-wo-ny-ga         ma-jad     yi-ngong-wo-ndi
       if        IRR-3SG/lSG-give-PST-SUB MA-big-ABS IRR-lSG/2SG-give-PST
        'If he had given me a lot, I would have given you [some]'.
  The Habitual verbal category (8.10.), in keeping with its categorial semantics, may be
used to specify background information in relation to linked clauses with independent
predicates, and in this capacity often is formally subordinate to them, as the following
examples illustrate:(470)   warramarlg-ba ma-nu-\vudba             nganu       dubuluj
        overturn-PS    HAB-2NSG-AUX-PRES ISO-DAT           bag-ABS

        what-DAT-INDEF    HAB-2SG-search-PRES-SUB maybe WU-money-DAT
        'You're always overturning my bag, what for? [as] you always search around
         maybe for money'.
198 Chapters  The Habitual, present subordinate-marked ""you always search(ing) around"" specifies
the general conditions under which the overturning occurs.(471) yi-gerrngmarnan   ngalyalya ma-yi-jmgi-n-ga                       mayi-wu
      YI-crybaby-ABS    cry       HAB-3-be-PRES-SUB                     food-DAT

      nes            HAB-2NSG-cook-PRES 3SG-DAT
        'He's a crybaby always crying for food, you don't cook for him all the time'.
  As in (471), the semantic subordinate linkage between two such clauses may be rather
weak, and even were the predicate of the first clause to be independent in form, the logical
linkage between the two clauses would be fairly obvious.(472) nga-wojbarna-n       ma-nganjaga                          dan-gar r

        Ί listen, I might go there, they [are] always talking to me'.
  Subordination of ""they sitting (talking)"" in (472) perhaps makes slightly more explicit
the reason for the subject's going where ""they"" are, that is, implies a logical linkage
between the two clauses.

5.7. Article suffix ~bi ~ -mAn article-like ending -bi —wi (see 3.6.) may be suffixed to many parts of speech, most
commonly to nominals, to adverbs, and more rarely, to verb particles. In general, the
article ending contributes specificity or concreteness to the meaning of the form to which
it is suffixed, but it does this in slightly different ways for different word classes.
   The article is suffixed to nominals of both substantive and adjectival kinds. In (138),
suffixed to body parts specifying the focus of action, it gives greater concreteness to their
involvement in the hitting:(138) 0-bu-ndi-ya                   darang-bi                  banggin-bi
      3SG/3SG-hit-PST               rump ABS-ART               back ABS-ART
        'He hit his rump part, back part'.
  With words designating place or geographic feature, the article equally contributes
specificity, and often is to be interpreted as having a pergressive sense with respect to the
predicate:(139) yirrgulun-bi                ya-0-gomarla-n
      river ABS-ART               3-3SG-follow-PRES
       'He is following along the river'.
  Notice the article is suffixed to Absolutive case-form.
  With nominals which specify condition or status, the contribution of the article is to
create something like a clausal complement meaning ""at the time of X"", or ""when X"",
where X is the condition or status.

 See also (108) above, a similar kind of example.(142) 0-nyanga-ndi     yi-merrug           yinggiya-wanda      danani
      3SG-come-PST YI-spirit-ABS whoABS-EMPH this-ABS

      'Who in the world is this spirit that has come? This is that same old woman
      who's come back from the west'.
  The above is from a text about child spirits. The speaker imitates someone's wondering
reaction to seeing such a spirit — ""Who is this?"" He then imitates recognition of the spirit
— ""It is the same one"", i.e., a previously known person who has returned in spirit form.
  The article suffix's occurrence with adverbs might be described as partly inflectional,
partly derivational. It may be freely suffixed to such adverbs as bulgu 'in the middle'
(bulgu-wi, or reduplicative bulgulgu-wi), to give greater concreteness to the specification
of locality; and to the specification of time with such adverbs as wirrig 'tomorrow',
dalgan 'forenoon, daytime', and bulju 'long ago':(143) bulju-wi         0-yanggi       yiwarna                   gandawag
      longago-ART      3SG-goPST other-ABS                      moon-ABS
      'He went long ago, last month'.
  It is now apparently inseparable in such adverbs as burrugawi 'long ago', which is not
attested without it.
  The article suffix is widely attested with demonstratives following certain other suffixes
such as locational -beng ~ -\veng (7.2.3.): dan-beng-bi 'right here in this place'.
Apparently doubled instances of the article suffixes have been recorded only with
demonstratives (not with other parts of speech), as in the following examples:(144) nana          0-bardarrma-rri     walanja-yi       gaya      yi-balanggin
      that-ABS      3SG-scratch-PST goanna-ERG           today    YI-newABS

      ya-0-jingi-n
      3-3SG-be-PRES
        'He's sitting in the grass with only his head out, he's right there'.
  Although the article suffix has been found to occur with forms which normally function
as verb particles, it is arguable that the suffix permits them to occur in a more distinctly
nominal function, that is, with nominal reference. In examples (146) and (147), the
article is suffixed to warduj which usually is paired with verbs of motion in the meaning
'disappear, vanish'; and wabaja likewise usually enters into combinations where it
means 'to get lost'.(146) warduj-bi                   wurr-bu-ndi
      disappear-ART                3NSG-hit-PST
        'They beat him out of sight'.(147) wabaja-wi      wurr-jarram-bu-rri go:::          ngawun                   wonggo

      birdij    wurr-gi-ndi
      find      3NSG-AUX-PST
        ""They looked around for him lost [one], nothing, they never found him'.
  Finally, it must be noted that there sometimes occurs a suffix of shape -yi which, while
its contribution to meaning remains somewhat difficult to specify, must apparently be
distinguished from -wi. An example which shows the two in close proximity is:(148) dirlyag-ba      wu-da-yi-rri-wuya                        wudu-wuya-wi
      sweetheart-PS   3NSG-AUX-RR-PST-DU                       little-DU-ART
      wudu-wunba-yi
      little-SOU-ADV?
       'They were sweethearts [from the time/when] the two of them were little,
       from little'.
  While the suffix -wi is clearly the article, -yi is probably to be related to the general
adverbial suffix mentioned above as common following adverbial -barra, and illustrated
in (112). There are forms with which seemingly either -wi or -yi may occur: notable
among these is the interjection meaning ""OK, all right, enough"", the usual form of which
is yilgba-yi. Suffixed with -wi, this appears to have a more clearly substantival character,
as in:(149) yilgba-wi         yi-dagbarla-n
      OK-ART             2SG-have-PRES
       'You have enough'.

5.8. Experiential and anaphoric specifiers
There is a suffix -wunyin (often realized as [winyin]) by means of which the speaker
presents that to which it is suffixed as having specific or particular reference. This may
or may not have been established textually: the form is not a textual anaphor, but rather
a (performative) marker of experiential specificity. It is a form for which one kind of
Kriol equivalent is a reinforcing use of ""now"": ""this one now"", ""me now"", etc.
  The first examples will be drawn from one text which is particularly rich in the use of
this suffix. The speaker tells of a place called Mawuya-ya, literally ""at the poison"", or
""poison place"". He describes how he or someone like him, closely affiliated to the place,
might go there to ask for poison in order to harm someone else. (The speaker explains
that people used to do this). He begins the story (divided into prosodic lines) as follows,
with an address by himself as visitor to the place:(150) dana-winyin
      this ABS-SPEC
      ngayugu
      1SGABS
      muymuy-munggayin
      [place]-territorial ABS
      mawuya            dana              nga-lawu-n

      'This one here [i.e., the speaker], me, a person of Muymuy, I come to get
      this poison'.
  The first line is the speaker's way of getting the place's attention; and he does so by
telling the place that he is someone here, now, known. Later he adds:(151) mad-barra       yinga-yana                 go
      word-ADV        IRR ISG-say PRES           3SG DAT
      ngayugu-winyin          yi-laglawun                 yibiwan

      1SGABS          ISG-come-PRES
      Ί might say to it: me now, a man of this place, X is my name, I've come'.
  The suffix is added following non-zero case-endings, e.g., nan-gu-winyin yum-gu Of
that particular kind of tree'.
  One text about a place again began with this suffix in the first line, that is with a
formulation by the speaker that the place is already referentially established or specific:(152) wu-dab          wu-dab-winyin          ya-0-jingi-n
      WU-cave         WU-cave-SPEC 3-3SG-be-PRES
      'The cave, the particular cave is there ...'.
96 Chapters  And another speaker talking of bush foods she used to eat said:(153) jarrug   go     nan-gu   galawarra-wu                    lany-gu  nana-winyin
      egg-ABS 3SG DAT that-DAT pigeon-DAT                      game-DAT that ABS-SPEC
       'Eggs of the spinifex pigeon, [exactly] that...'.
  It seems quite probable that etymologically, this suffix is to be regarded as nominal
class prefix wu- followed by monosyllabic stem -nyin.
  There is a suffix -marlang, much less frequent in the data, which contrasts with -winyin
in that it appears to be much more clearly a textual anaphor. Its use signals that something
has previously been referred to, or established, somewhere in the discourse. It is a kind
of category which often seems to find an equivalent in Kriol usage of the demonstrative
""that"" as textual anaphor.
  -marlang is added to nouns and demonstratives, following any overt case- marker, and
has been also recorded on subordinate (NP-relative type) verb forms. The suffix itself
is invariant in form. It occurred in a story about a fight between brolga and emu, in which
both had previously been introduced, but emu had not been mentioned for some time.(154) gumurrinji-marlang      bagbag 0-bu-ndi                 yi-warli           bag
      emu-ΑΝΑ                 break   3-AUX-PST               YI-arm-ABS         break
      yi-bam           darang       wayana
      YI-head-ABS      rump-AB S    and all
       'He broke the arm of that emu, broke his head and rump and all'.
 In another part of the same story we find:(155) bornorro-yi-marlang         debgarra    wunggun-bu-ndi-ya             duy-ma nard
      brolga-ERG-ANA              hiding      3SG/3NSG-hit-PST-NAR          heap-PS lot
       'That brolga beat the whole lot [emu's children] to a pulp'.
 From camp conversation the following example was recorded:(156) layin-marlang               ngerr-me-we           dog-ba
      meat ABS-ANA                1 INPL-get-FUT        cut-PS
       'That meat, we have to get a cut [half, quarter] of it'.
  In a text about marriage, the speaker has been describing the kind of man to whom an
additional wife would be promised, and has mentioned that such a man would be expected
to work for, and to dance in ceremony for, his (promised) mother-in-law. Later in this
text we find:(157) nana              yi-warna-gari            yi-namun-garang
      that-ABS          YI-other-other-ABS       YI-sister-having-ABS

       'The other one who has [is married to] the elder sister, that one who [as
       mentioned] dances for her, that's the one to whom they give her'.
  (157) illustrates -nrarlang suffixed to a subordinate verb form, which already has a
more nominal character in that it describes ""one who dances"". This example also shows
clearly the functional difference between -warlang and -wnnyin.
  In a text about social classification, the speaker has been bemoaning, as older people
often do, the laxity of present sexual and marital partnerships, and says:(158) gaya-warlang         ngawurnen       wu-warlam                  wagbawun
      today-ΑΝΑ            whole lot       WU-skin-ABS                lacking
       'Today [as I've said] it's open slather, there arc no skins' [i.e., there is no
       observance of appropriate restrictions].
 (158) illustrates the very general kind of textually anaphoric function that -niarlang
may have.
 There were lengthy texts in which this suffix did not occur at all.","[116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"
"5.2.6. AblativeAblative case signals that the nominal to which it is suffixed is the point of departure for
some motion or transit, as in (78) and (79):(78)   wumbang          yi-bu-n                       wiya-wa

  The Ablative has two somewhat specialized uses. One is to indicate the route followed,
a pergressive notion, as in (80):(80)   ngarr-ga-n                 wu-ma-wa       yondorr-wa     wonggo

       'Let's take it by the good road, we mustn't take it by that bad way'.
 The second is to express the notion ""up to, point to which"":

       yiberr-wa         'up to the leg'

case-ending -gunya ~ -wunya. With human and animate nominals, it generally expresses
an anti-benefactive notion: person or entity ""away from whom"" the predicate's meaning
is to be understood. It may also be understood to express ""on account"" of a human or
animate, though this meaning is secondary with such nominals. However, with inanimate
nominals, the case-ending usually is understood to express the meaning ""on account of
the entity to which it is suffixed.(82)   dordo-werreng          ngarr-ya         gunya                    yingangun-bu

       away for us/on our behalf.
  The Dissociative form in (82) is a complement of the verb of going. It differs from
Ablative in that it does not merely express the notion of ""point of departure"", but
additionally the idea of going to get away from the referent of the Dissociative-marked
nominal; hence the ""anti-benefactive"" sense of the case-form.(83)   mowoj             0-yanggi             nganunya

       'He took the old man's wife away from him'.
  There is an interesting, somewhat different usage of Dissociative. The 3SG independent
pronominal form gunya is sometimes found to be used to mark, not the ""person away
from whom"" the predicate action (trajectory, position etc.) is to be understood, but rather
an ""anti-benefactive"" consequence of what is predicated by the verb for a major clausal
participant. In other words, here the Dissociative actually functions somewhat more
directly like an additional element of the predicate, implying that there will be a negative
consequence for a participant of engaging in the verbal activity.

       'It's [a] dirty [thing], he threw it down and it's got dirt on it, you ought not

 In (86), gunya relates to the 2SG participant expressing the notion that eating the thing
mentioned has negative implications, will not be of benefit, but ""anti-benefactive"".(87)   narrng-ma         nunu-we                      gunya
       stuck-PS          2NSGIRR-AUX                 3SG DISS
        'You might get stuck'.
  Here, Dissociative underscores that what is predicated as possible (getting stuck) will
be non-beneficial for 2NSG. The same kind of relation between predicate and participant
is found in (88):(88)   0-jarram-bu-rri   birdij             0-gi-ndi            gunya           jimimdi

       0-jarlgba-rri-wan
       3SG-stab-PST-DF
        'He looked around, found the knife [to his detriment] and stabbed him'.
  It is difficult to fluently translate the anti-benefactive contribution of gunya above. It
is understood to mean that the finding of the knife was of detriment to the one who is
understood victim, and direct object of the verb ""to stab"". (88), however, differs from
(86) and (87) in that, presumably, any independent Dissociative form could be substituted
there, and the meaning understood in relation to that person-number category. That is,
in (88), the Dissociative is not a third person category interpreted directly as an element
of predicate meaning, as in (86) and (87).
  With inanimate and non-human nominals, Dissociative case marks the thing ""on
account of which"":(89)   wonggo           wurr-yo-rri            ngawun-gunya             layin-gunya

       ""They didn't spear him for nothing, [but] on account of meat'.
  A final example shows that, where in context a human or animate nominal is clearly
understood as one ""on whose account"" or more generally ""in relation to whom"" the
predicate action is understood, the case-suffix is interpreted accordingly.

       'The two Lightnings boomeranged each other, Yagjagbula and Jabirringgi,
       on account of Garnayanda, they boomeranged each other on her account'.  (90) is taken from a version of the Lightning Brothers myth. The two brothers fought
with each other over one's theft of the other's wife, Garnayanda.
  One common way of asking ""what for"" in the explicit sense On account of what' is
ngamanda-wunya [what-DISS], and this may be further suffixed with the indefinite,
emphatic interrogative -warda (7.5.8.): ngamanda-wunya-wanda 'whatever in the world
for?'
  It is clear that when Dissociative can be understood in relation to a major clausal
participant (one marked by subject or object pronominals in the verb), it is interpreted in
the sense ""away from"" with reference to that participant (with verbs of motion and
trajectory), or in anti-benefactive sense. Where it is not interpretable as conveying
meaning in relation to such a major clausal participant, it is interpreted in the sense ""on
account of. Thus the latter may be the interpretation given to instances with both
inanimate and animate nominal; but for this to occur with the latter, the animate nominal
must be clearly interpretable (from clause and text structures) as other than a major
clausal participant.
  It is important to make explicit that Dative, not Dissociative, is generally used as the
complement of verbs of taking (me-) and stealing (e.g., ditransitive mowo-). In the latter,
the person stolen from is marked by object pronominal on the verb (ngon-mowo-rri 'he
stole it from me'), and any use of independent 1SG Dissociative pronoun in construction
with the ditransitive verb generally receives a speaker judgment equivalent to
""ungrammatical"". But also, a meaning such as 'he took it from him' tends to be expressed
0-me-ndi gunga, with 3SG independent Dative pronominal. Thus Dative is typically
used to express something that may practically be understood as anti-benefactive, but it
is not generally expressed as Dissociative. In example (85), use of Dissociative gives a
fairly concrete spatial formulation to the verb and complement, something like ""took
away, physically carried away from him"". Dative is clearly the more general case, and
may express a relation to a complement of both semantically benefactive and
anti-benefactive kinds. See example (119) below.","[102, 103, 104, 105]"
"12.2.3. Gala 'try'The particle gala has been found in construction with verbs in the following tense-
aspect-mood forms: present, admonitive (marked by zero-stem form or distinctive future
stem, depending on the verb), and imperative. With predicates in present tense, only first
person forms, or pronominal adjuncts which include a first person, have been found to
occur. That is, with present tense which expresses relative certainty or imminence of
unfulfilled action, apparently only first persons (or first-plus-others) can have the
appropriate intentional status as actors. In construction with gala, although formal
admonitive and imperative forms have both been found to occur, the former are
uncommon, and semantically not clearly distinct from the imperative, among other
reasons because such forms have only been found with second person subjects. The only
difference may be between admonitive and imperative that the former make the
imperative force of the utterance slightly less, or more tentative. See discussion
following the examples concerning why gala may occur with ""admonitive"" future-tense
forms, and not with the ordinary future (8.6.). First, examples of gala with first person
(plus) pronominal adjuncts, and present tense forms are:

  If gala were equivalent to English ""try"", it should be possible to use it in the past tense.
The fact that this is not possible shows that gala is not equivalent to English ""try"", and
that its core meaning is one of uncertainty concerning an as-yet unrealised state of affairs.
Combined with the present tense, gala expresses intention of the first person (plus) subject.
  Combined with first- or second-person subject future-admonitive forms, it expresses
either the subject's inner sense of necessity to do what the predicate designates (first
persons), or the attribution (to second persons) of an intentional force. Notice then how
such future-admonitive forms appear to differ from the ordinary future, e.g., nganjigbe
Ί will go, I must go', in which no sense of indeterminacy or uncertainty is attributable
to the subject, but rather only unmitigated volition, intention, or necessity to the subject-
predicate combination as a whole. The ordinary future, in other words (see 8.6.) is a form
of the verb which expresses all such meanings but without clearly distinguishing if, or
the extent to which, they are to be attributed to the subject, or exactly where necessity
and intentionality are to be located. The distinctive future-stem or admonitive
construction differs from the ordinary future precisely in modality, in that it expresses
uncertainty (and most generally, undesirability) of an as-yet unrealised state of affairs. It
is thus possible for it (rather than the ordinary future) to co-occur with gala. With
imperative forms, gala expresses the clearer attribution of uncertainty to the agency of
the second person subject, i.e., ""you try to do X"" (but you may not succeed).
  Seeing ""uncertainty"" as the core semantic dimension of gala, with different
modulations of intentionality varying with tense-aspect-mood form of the verb, helps to
understand the interjectional formation possible with this particle, gala-warda, best
translated as either Ί don't know', or more generally'who knows?','it's not clear', where
the uncertainty is understood in relation to the speaker as a pragmatic effect of the usage
of the expression. Here, gala is paired with the indefinite suffix -warda (7.5.8.), and is
thus a regular member of the set of forms which may be so suffixed, expressing general
uncertainty. Examples of usage of this form are shown in the following conversation-like
sequences (invented by informants without suggestion as to content, to illustrate the
meaning of gala-warda):(734) A:       guda-ni         0-yanggi        jangari      yilama-gan 0-yanggi

"8.2. Overview of tense-aspect-mood categoriesA main contrast within the system of verbal categories is that between Indicative and
Irrealis tense-mood-aspect forms. Indicative forms are those in which there is no explicit
qualification of the reality or eventuality of that which is designated by the predicate;
Irrealis forms are those which are overtly so qualified. The distinction must be seen as
one which is tailored to the linguistic categories, however, for not all Indicative forms
designate ""real"" events. They are used rather to make predicate meanings in a way that
involves no explicit qualification of the factuality or eventuality of what the predicate
designates.
  The Indicative categories are Present, Past, Future and Potential, each of which is
described and illustrated in a separate section below. Each category is marked by one or
more allomorphs, and the tense-mood-aspect categories in the language overall are highly
regular and show little variation. The Present, Future and Potential forms have non-past
ya- in first position within the inflecting verb in 'third person' forms, i.e., in those where
the sole pronominal adjunct is third person, and in those in which both subject and object
are third persons (see 6.6.). This initial non-past, third person prefix in the non-past
categories contrasts with zero in the same position in the Past forms of the verb, e.g.,
yanggun-bu-n 'he is hitting them', versus wunggun-bu-ndi 'he hit them'.
  As a whole, the Indicative mood contrasts with Irrealis mood. Irrealis is directly
signalled by first-position prefix(es) in the verb, in general yayi- for 'third person' forms
(as above), and yi- for non-third person forms. There are also some differences from
Indicative forms in person-marking pronominals (6.6.3. for further details). Irrealis
prefixation may co-occur both with Present and Past tense marking, and further, with a
zero-stem form, i.e., one with no explicit tense-aspect suffixation. Irrealis prefixation
with Present forms of the verb expresses modal meanings of the sort ""ought to"", and with
negative particles (either wonggo or warna, 12.2.5.), meanings 'should not', and 'cannot'
(either inability or physical and/or social constraint). Negative Imperatives in Wardaman
(8.9.2.) are not formally distinguished from such forms. Irrealis prefixation with Past
tense marking expresses past counterfactual meanings ""meant to"", ""ought to have"", and
the like. Irrealis prefixation with zero-stem expresses mere possibility ""may, might"" (and
contrasts with Potential, which expresses eventuality but without qualification of the
reality of the event designated by the predicate). A particular use of the Irrealis zero-stem
forms is in what may be called ""admonitive"" constructions, often best translated by use
of English ""lest"". There will be some illustration in this chapter of all of these forms and
uses, and forward reference to discussion of conditional and other constructions in
following chapters.
176 Chapter 8  Most verbs in Wardaman have an invariable stem to which inflectional endings are
added. Some, however, show a distinctive Future stem form, that is, a stem to which
Future suffix is added. For those verbs which have distinctive Future stem, this is also
found in Irrealis zero-suffix forms, i.e. with Irrealis prefixation and zero suffixation to
the stem, to express mere possibility, and also in the admonitive semantic construction
type mentioned above.
  The verbs which have distinctive Future stem are all ones with final stem-vowel a: all
those verbs with final syllable -ma ~ -ba, as well asyana- 'say, do', nyanga- 'come', and
the irregular ya- 'go'. (Not all stems with final a, however, have a distinctive Future
stem; for example, la- 'to bite', ga- 'to take', ba- 'to burn', do not). To exemplify the
relation between the regular and Future stem, and the Irrealis form with zero suffix, we
can take the verb nyanga-: Present 3SG form ya-0-nyanga-n, PUT ya-0-nyangi-we, and
zero-suffixed Irrealis form yayi-0-nyangi 'lest he come'. The vowel of the regular stem
is a, that of the Future stem, i (following which the Future suffix -wa becomes -we). In
this sharing of stem by Future and (one of the) Irrealis paradigmatic forms, we see some
indication of the historical nature of the Future as a sub-category of Irrealis mood. From
this we may assume that the generalization of the -wa as Future suffix is a later
development in the language, and that stem alternation is a relic of an earlier, somewhat
different organization of tense-mood categories.
  The Positive Imperative (8.7.) is neither Indicative nor Irrealis. ""Hortative"" (8.8.)
constitutes a semantic category of forms of urging (""let us go"", ""may he go"" etc.), but
the first-position prefix complex is distinctive only in third person forms. Otherwise, the
prefix complex is not distinguished from that found in Indicative forms.
  There is an Habitual verbal category (8.10.), which has been found to occur only with
Present-tense suffixation on the verb, and may also have additionally non-past
subordinate suffixation. As noted in 6.6.4., formally the Habitual prefix complex has
much in common with the Irrealis mood category, but there is no reason to see Habitual
synchronically as a sub-category of Irrealis. Final sections of this chapter describe
reflexive-reciprocal marking, minor aspectual categories of the verb (marked by outer
suffixes), and subordinate marking. There is also a discussion of the paradigm of the
highly irregular verb ""to go"".","[199, 200]"
"
10.6. The negated noun phraseOne of the most commonly heard words in Wardaman is ngawun 'nothing, none'. One
man of my acquaintance was in fact called by the nickname ""Ngawun"", because
whenever anybody asked him for anything they could be sure of his answer. However,
ngawun is an interjection. The particle which most commonly negates the noun or noun
phrase is wonggo, or secondarily warna. These always precede that which they negate
(see 12.2.5.).(590) wonggo             lege              miwinin
      not               one-ABS            sleep-ABS
        'Not [just] one night'.(591) wonggo            yerriyn
      not               [place]
        'Not Yerriyn' [but some other place].(592)   wonggo          nganinggin         yi-marnayn
        not             mine-ABS           husband-ABS
        'Not my husband'.
                                                        Issues in constituency and word order 241  It has been mentioned and illustrated in several places that negative indefinites are
formed with the above particles, and the regular interrogative words, e.g., \vonggo
yinggiya 'nobody'.","[264, 265]"
"  The Allative complement is in (b)Juba-warr. The particle jub(a) may mean 'shut' or
'be blocked, deaf, depending on the finite verb. In the meaning ""shut in"", ""shut oneself
in"" (as a goanna may do), it usually occurs with finite verb bit-. Here it must be
understood to complement walanja 'goanna', the object of ""hit"" or ""kill"" in (a).
  Commonly, in Wardaman, a transitive clause may occur without independent nominal
object: the object may be indicated only in the pronominal prefix (see 10.10. for
discussion of its relative lexical frequency of occurrence). As we have seen, in Wardaman
generally, case-marking of complement clauses should be regarded as applying to major
constituents of the entire clause; thus, e.g., predicate and major argument nominal phrases
are alike Source-marked (11.5.). A further indication of complement case-marking of
major constituents ""across the board"" is the following. Often though there is no objective
nominal argument of an Allative-marked, objective complement clause, there may
nevertheless be what might most appropriately be regarded as an 'adverb' modifying
(complementing) the main clause. Adverbs, as noted a number of different times (see
e.g., Chapter 4) cannot be sharply distinguished from particles in Wardaman. Such
adverbs by themselves may be Allative-marked, as if they were particles and/or occurred
in the complement clause with a particle. Two examples follow:(708)    wonggo          ya-yi-da-n                               baraj-garr
         neg             IRR-lEXNSG/3SG-see-PRES                  far-ALL
         'We cannot see it a long way off.(709)    yi-da-n                           jewele-warr
         lEXSNG/3SG-see-PRES                close-ALL
         'We see it close up'.",[313]
"
2.3. Distributional restrictions: ConsonantsWord-initially there is no distinctive contrast bet wee n consonants of the two apical series.
Where no vowel immediately precedes, in ordinary speech the word-initial realization
of initial apicals tends to be alveolar rather than retroflex. However, when a vowel (of
another word, or of a vowel-final inflectional prefix) immediately precedes, the stem-
initial norm tends to be quite strongly retroflex (but in terms of auditory impression, not
quite so much so as in some languages of the region, for example, Ngalakan). For
example:
       ['na.rri]         'he saw it'
       [yi'rna.rri ]     'you [SG] saw it'
      ['climana]        'horse'
      [y/ 'rdirdiman ] proper name, YI- class marker  Though there is no reason to recognize a word-initial contrast between the two stop-
nasal series, the question remains how to represent the morpheme-initial norm, as plain
alveolar, or as retroflex, or perhaps some other way which shows that there is no clear
auditory contrast except post-vocalically, and following non-nasal sonorants.
  This situation, or something similar, presents itself in a number of the local languages
that have two apical series (see e.g., Merlan 1983: 9-10); that is, there is no, or in some
languages scarcely any, direct contrast between morpheme-initial alveolar and retroflex
apicals. Though the situation might be descriptively treated in a number of ways, my
preference is to regard morphemes as retroflex initial. Phonetically, the retroflex series
is relatively marked, the plain alveolar unmarked. In light of this, it is theoretically more
satisfactory to explain the lack of phonetic contrast word-initially by a neutralization in
favour of realization by the less marked series, than to treat the situation as one in which
retroflexion adds a feature to some kind of archiphonemic segment in the post-vocalic
environment (following a vowel-final prefix).
  However, a practical cost is associated with the decision to treat morphemes as retroflex
initial. Usage in most of this description, as is otherwise common, is to represent retroflex
segments in practical orthography by a digraph consisting of r plus a letter designating
the rest of the segment (e.g., rd for the apical stop, etc.). It is daunting to write the r
morpheme initially, a procedure which results in forms like rdagbarla 'keep it', and
rnarri 'he/she saw it'. Therefore in practical transcription, lexeme-initial apicals will
be represented without initial r. This practice is extended to phonetic environments in
which retroflexion is quite pronounced, as after vowel-final prefixes (e.g., nga-nam Ί
saw it'). This makes it necessary for anyone reading this transcription to keep in mind
that, following vowel-final prefixes and elsewhere post-vocalically, the pronunciation of
initial apical consonants of lexical stems is with a significant degree of retroflexion.
                                                                          Segmental phonology 17
  The contrast between apical series is amply illustrated elsewhere, morpheme- and
word-medially and finally. In word-final position note the contrasts between members
of each series:
   /gulid/      'green plum'          vs.          /mardird/           'whistling kite'
   /menjen/      'dangerous'          vs.          /mejern/            'belly'
                                      vs.          /yingelembern/      'collarbone'   /jurrul/     'saltwater turtle'    vs.          /nyurl/             'be/get angry'   There are additionally numerous examples of minimal and sub-minimal contrasts
medially between the two series: e.g., wu-walu 'ring finger' vs. wu- warli 'arm, creek,
tributary'; yirrgitlun 'river' vs.yigurliyn 'first rain'; ngone 'hooked spear' vs. wurne
 'bone'; yi-welen 'jealousperson' vs.yi-werlen 'lazy person'; bidij 'twist' vs.birdij'find'
 (particles); gelelen 'cold' vs. gerle- 'to taste'; gitda 'where' vs. bigurda, a kind of plat
potato; gadi 'lily' vs. gardirrg 'gnash teeth' (particle), and so on.
   The above generalization does not apply to the rhotics, since /IT/ has not been found
initially in lexical stems, and only two instances of /r/ have been noted to date: the bird
term rewrew 'dollar bird', and a toponym (referring to a creek near Willeroo Station
homestead in the Wardaman heartland, and seemingly not a foreign form), Relwuyugun.
Besides the fact that the bird term is onomatopoetic, it should also be noted that very
similar terms for this bird occur in neighbouring languages. It is likely that there are
complex diffusional relations among them. However, in Jawoyn the form of the word is
dewdew, and beyond the surmise that the diffusional source is not from Jawoyn, it is not
clear why Wardaman should have a form with an initial segment that does not otherwise
occur in that position in the language.
   /rr/ does occur initially in inflectional morphemes which can never be word-initial, e.g.,
in the past tense allomorph -rri. /r/ is (so far) not attested in stem-final position, indicating
at the least that it is c[uite uncommon there, if indeed it may occur at all. The apical /rr/
however is common finally, e.g., /bamarr/ Owenia vernicosa, 'marble tree', /geremerr/
'headband', and so on.
   Medially, the contrast between the two rhotics distinguishes a considerable number of
forms, and there is no reason to regard the contrast as marginal (cf. Cook 1987: 29 on
Wakiman). Exemplifying by comparing the sequences -ara- and-arra-, we may list the
contrasting forms, among others: war ay 'ask', baraj 'far', garab 'spider', wuniara
'heavy stone', janiaram1 lid, doof,garnaniara 'walking stick' Jabara 'putrid, stinking',
barangan 'rift,gap',darab 'bog', and-garang ~ -warang 'having'; vs. barlarra 'hide',
barragarl 'spear', buwarraja 'dreaming', lawarra 'riflefish', warrala 'lie, be spread-
legged5, warrania ' sugar glider', -barra ~ -warra adverbial suffix, among others.
   Some consideration needs to be given to the statement of the distributions of the two
palatal sonorants ly and ny. We will consider the lamino-palatal lateral first, since its
distribution, however analyzed, is especially restricted Then we will return to questions
of the statement of distribution that apply to both lateral and nasal palatal segments.
   The lamino-palatal lateral (unlike the nasal) never occurs in stem- or word-initial
position, and its occurrence medially (excluding, for the moment, intervocalically) and
18 Chapter 2finally is quite restricted, both lexically and positionally. The following includes all
instances of medial (save intervocalic) and final ly found in a list of approximately 2000
(mostly lexical) roots (excluding names of all sorts, personal, toponymic and other):

     jalybug                      'pound, crush up, mince'
     jilyma                       'wring out, squeeze (juices) out of
     milygbilygba                 'beat, thump, ""heart-crack"" [Kr.], be shocked'
     wily ma                      'stretch'
      wilyma                      'whistle' (different AUX from above)
     yarrbayl                     'bother, annoy'  This list demonstrates that about half the instances of the lamino-palatal lateral are final
in verb particles (which often have the additional morph -ma, see 11.1.2.)· Otherwise,
the lateral occurs only before peripheral segments (mainly stops b and g, but note one
instance before w). Overall, the lateral shows a nearly-complete lexical restriction to verb
particles (with the exception ofdilygun 'possum', and the derivate bilybanbilyban).
  There are comparable distributional restrictions on the lamino-palatal lateral in
Yangman, as far as the more limited data indicate. Also, there is in Mangarrayi a small
handful of />'-final verb particles (four have been found). And though all of these appear
to also occur in Yangman, and evidently represent an historical diffusion from that
language, inquiry indicates they are now regarded by speakers as Mangarrayi words, and
not as recognizable borrowings. The restricted distribution of this lateral can, on the basis
of the evidence, be seen as an areal phenomenon in which Mangarrayi participates
marginally.
  In Wardaman, there seems to be little plausibility to the suggestion that these instances
may be viewed (historically) as combinations of / plus a high vowel IM phonetically
realized as palatalization. There are enough cases of stem-final // (e.g., mangali 'girl,
female') to make it clear that such palatalization is not, in any event, a synchronic process.
And there are attestations of word-final lyi, as in /malyi/, toponym. In contrast with the
lateral, the palatal nasal is much more common stem-finally, and is distributed over
different parts of speech (e.g., juyn 'to set' (of sun, particle), jirrangaliyn 'mud
swallow'). It, too, contrasts directly with final nyi (as in mobonyi 'night time').
  There is, however, some question about analysis of both palatal sonorants
intervocalically, simply because in that position there is no clear or convincing basis for
a contrast between ly versus a combination /+ y, or between ny versus n+ y, as there
                                                                          Segmental phonology 19
is finally. This is true, for example, of a word for a catfish species, which could
alternatively be /ginyang/ or /ginyang/, or the word for 'echidna' which might
alternatively be represented phonemically as /gawalyan or /gawalyan/.
  The question of a two-segment versus single-segment analysis may simply be said to
be irrelevant in those medial environments. There is no phonetic difference that can be
established between the two possibilities. We can show this by observing inter-
morphemic combinations of n + y and / + y, where the y is the initial segment of an
inflectional suffix (e.g., YI-buruwun-yi 'killer', ERG). In the text transcriptions in
practical orthography, morphemic combination is always distinguished from intra-
morphemic ny and ly by a hyphen at morpheme boundary.
  In summary concerning word- and morpheme-final position, we note that all stops and
nasals, all the laterals, the glides /y/ and /w/, and apical /IT/ are attested, while /r/ is not.
A few examples attest to final contrast between each glide, and the combination of glide
and homorganic vowel, for example:
      dawu      'that way'         vs.          daw                   'sound sleep',
                                           also maw                   'take off'
      waray     'ask'              vs.          gunduyi-ma            'give hiding, belt'  The set of final nasal contrasts is illustrated by:
      yi-mum            'eye'
      gunbilin          '(native) doctor'
      mejern            'stomach'
      garnbayn          'type of cabbage palm'
      gayardung         'run'  The contrast among laterals finally is exemplified by:
     jil-ma             'company, keep company' (particle)
     jily-ma            'wring, squeeze' (particle)
     mirlirl-ma         'rise' (of sun)  The final contrast among stops is illustrated by:
     bardab             'look around'
     dulwad             'count, enumerate'
     mardird            'kite'
     garnbij             'clapstick'
     gandawag           'moon'2.4. Phonotactics: Consonant clustersThere are no morpheme-initial consonant clusters except for the very rare combination
gl, so far attested in only two forms: -gle 'putrid, rotten', and medially in the (obligatorily
reduplicative) particle lowaglowa 'play', gle- has never been found to occur
20 Chapter 2
word-initially, but rather is always preceded by one of the noun class prefixes (yi-gle,
wu-gle). There is also a place name wugleni 'Johnstone Hole', which might be related
etymologically to the root -gle. There is at least one instance, in a bird name, of a
particularly minimal and indistinct, if indeed organic, vocalic segment between b snarl.
This occurs in the word \jnjiirijbllrlan]' friar bird'. However, there are no other instances
suggesting the possibility of a cluster bl.
  Within morphemes, combinations of apical nasal plus apical stop contrast as between
the two apical series: nd vs. rnd. As in neighbouring languages, there are no such
combinations in which the nasal and stop differ in place. The same is true for the (rare)
combinations of lateral plus apical stop (e.g., Id, which only occur at reduplicative
boundaries). The transcriptional practice adopted for the retroflex combinations is to
write the indicator of retroflexion only once, thus: rnd, rid.","[40, 41, 42, 43, 44]"

3.4. Final syllable reduction in nominal stemsThere is a pervasive process of final syllable reduction in nominal stems before non-zero
suffix. However, one finds that to some of the same stems that are often reduced, on
other occasions speakers will add case and other endings without reduction. That is, the
process of reduction appears at least partly facultative. Elicitation concerning this matter
reveals an extensive speaker willingness to accept either particular reduced forms as
described below, or unreduced stem forms (with a few exceptions where speakers will
only accept the unreduced form as inflecting stem, e.g., with banggin 'back'). In general,
then, we are not dealing with a matter of strict grammaticality. Despite the apparent
speaker flexibility, one finds from both elicitation and text materials that a certain stem
form, either reduced or unreduced, is the most common for a particular noun, when the
speaker is asked to use the noun in some context, rather than to concentrate on the
acceptability of one or another stem form. There are only a few nouns for which the
reduction process seems to be truly optional in a statistical sense. Therefore, I will
include some comments below about the most common forms for particular nouns.
  Cook (1987: 80-83) describes a generally similar process in Wakiman, but the details
differ considerably for each language. Wardaman and Yangman are much more similar
to each other in respect of this process than either is to Wakiman.
  In Wardaman, a significant number of nominals (nouns and adjectival nouns) end in
final syllable -CVn. However, it seems for purposes of describing the reduction process
we should distinguish between final -Cin syllables, for some of which (depending partly
on the identity of C) there is often reduction up to and including the entire syllable; and
final -CVn, by which here we understand V to be any vowel besides /. In the latter type,
reduction is simply of the final -n, which may therefore be identified synchronically as
an Absolutive suffix for large numbers of nominals, and historically as that, and/or as
some sort of nominal derivational suffix. (It is also the latter synchronically, see 11.1.4.).
  Taking the simplest case first, that of -CVn in the sense identified above, we may
exemplify loss of final -n before non-zero ending with luwun 'cave', bomdoyorron
'pandanus', gangman 'kangaroo' and wurren 'child'. Usual case forms for such nouns
are, e.g., Locative luwu-ya 'in the cave', Allative luwu-warr 'into the cave', and Ablative
luwu-wa 'from the cave'; Locative borndoyorro-ya 'in the pandanus', borndoyorro-warr
'to the pandanus', and borndoyorro-wa 'from the pandanus'; Ergative gangma-yi
'kangaroo', Dative gangma-wu; Ergative wurre-yi 'child', Dative wurre-wu, Dual
Absolutive wurre- wuya, Plural Absolutive wurre-mulu, and so on.
   Adjectival nouns like the word Wardaman itself commonly undergo reduction. For
example, from that stem may be created a form meaning explicitly ""Wardaman
language"", with class prefix wu-. Usually (but not invariably) reduced and inflected with
an adverbial suffix, this expression is commonly used to mean ""by means of the
Wardaman language, in Wardaman"": wu-wardama-warra (one also finds simply
                                                                        Process phonology 29
wardama-warra, and also wardaman-barra is acceptable though appears to be less
common in actual usage when attention is not focused on the reduction process).
   For all -CVn nominals with minimally bisyllabic root (i.e., excluding such nouns as
wu-bin 'thumb', to which the process does not apply) reduction is far more common
before non-zero affix than is retention of -n.
   There is at least one high-frequency nominal to which -n is commonly added to create
an inflecting (Ergative) stem-form, where the -n does not appear in the Absolutive. This
is lege One', which has alternative (and approximately equally used) Ergative forms
lege-yi and lege-n-yi. Other cases are built on the zero stem.
   There is greater variability in patterning among nominals with final syllable -Cin, and
it seems we ought to distinguish at least three sub-types here, though most of them exhibit
some internal variability. These are: nominals with final syllable -Nin, where N is a nasal;
of final syllable -L/R/Y where L is a lateral, R a rhotic, Υ the semivowel; and of type
-Sin, where S is a stop (and here, the most variable sub-set of this sort has final syllable
-gin; variation is linked to the segment which precedes this final syllable).
   Nominals with final -Nin are the least variable. The inflecting stem is formed by
reduction of -in. Examples are: Absolutive linin 'snake', ERG lin-yi, DAT lin-gu;
Absolutive yumin 'tree, wood', INST yum-nyi (see 3.5.4. for the assimilatory process
here), LOG yum-nya, DAT yum-gu, Adverbial yum-barra; ABS langganin 'billabong',
LOG langgan-nya, etc. However, there is some variation in longer stems of this
description as to whether they reduce or not; e.g., Absolutive marranyin 'sand, sugar',
has alternative inflected forms Ablative marranyin-ba or marrany-ba, 'having' forms
marranyin-garang or marrany-garang, and so on. In my data the reduced forms are more
common than unreduced for trisyllabic -Nin stems.
   However, it is important to mention that some nouns with final nasal segment, where
this was preceded by another consonant (i.e., there would have remained a cluster after
syllable reduction), were found not to conform to the -Nin pattern described above, but
rather reduced only -n, or not at all. An example of this kind is warlngin 'fly', which had
usual and acceptable case-inflected forms of the sort warlngi-yi or warlngin-yi (ERG).
Below it becomes clear that the presence of stem-final clusters is a factor relevant to
reduction where other segments types are involved.
   The second sub-type is -L/R/Yin, where the syllable margin is a non-nasal sonorant.
Here the most common pattern seems to be for final syllable to lose -in, but loss of just
-n is attested in some nouns, and (perhaps relevant) particularly commonly with certain
kinds of suffixes. There are also in the class two high-frequency nouns layin 'game, meat',
and mayin 'vegetable food', and besides conforming to the minority pattern in that both
typically lose only -n, the former is idiosyncratic in its possible stem-forms.
  The most general pattern for this sub-type, loss of-in, can be illustrated by the common
nouns, Absolutive forms of which arejerrin 'ground oven', warnarrin 'fat', and bulilin
'blood': Locative jerr-ya, Ablative jerr-wa, DAT jerr-wu; DAT warnarr-wu, 'having'
warnarr-warang; 'having' bulil-warang ('menstruating'). However, non-reduced
alternatives are accepted for most such nouns (e.g., LOG jerrin-nya), though they are
not in fact as commonly used.
30 Chapters   One problem with saying that reduction of -in is the most common pattern is that, for
 nouns of the -L/K/Yin sub-type, those that, because of the nature of their referents, most
 typically occur in Ergative case-form, have been found to show reduction of only -n in
 that form. Examples are: ABS garlirlin 'mosquito', ERG garlirli-yi; ABSjuwarin 'Long
 Tom', ERG juwari-yi; ABS geyirrin 'dew, frost', ERG geyirri-yi; ABS murrurin
 'mud-dauber', ERG murruri-yi. However, some of the same nouns have other common
 inflectional or derivational forms which show loss of -in, e.g., geyirr-warang 'dewy,
 frosty'. While informants readily accept geyirrin-garang, they do not accept geyirri-
 warang. For any of the above nouns, informants will produce and readily accept
 unreduced forms, e.g., geyirrin-yi 'dew' (ERG), or garlirlin-yi 'mosquito' (ERG). This
 set of facts is evidence of some specialization of the reduction process by suffix type,
 seemingly not very far advanced, however, in the context of general variability in final
 syllable reduction.
   The two common nouns of this sub-type mentioned above show different tendencies.
Mayin 'vegetable food' tends to exhibit inflecting stem mayi-, i.e., with reduction of -n
only. DAT mayi-wu, 'having' mayi-warang, etc. However, both accepted and used is the
 unreduced stem mayin, e.g., DAT mayin- gu. This seems to be of higher frequency with
 Dissociative and Source suffixes, mayin-gunya, mayin-gunba, seemingly an indication
of the overall somewhat more clitic-like morpho-syntactic status of these case-endings
compared to the elementary or non-composite cases (see Chapter 5). On the other hand,
layin exhibits with about equal frequency the Dative forms layi-wu and lany-gu. In other
cases the latter appears to be most common, e.g., ABL lany-ba. (There is no
corresponding stem *many- for mayin). Informants found the Ergative form *layi-yi
unusual/unacceptable, both layin-yi and lany-nyi common and acceptable. Instances of
the latter noun in Ergative case are not infrequent, especially since layin clearly can have
the general sense 'game animal'. This appears to be linked to the fact that, in that sense
(as distinct from the sense ""game meat""), the word is often found in construction with a
specific term designating a kind of animal, e.g., layin gangman 'kangaroo (game)' (see
 10.5.). Thus, specific animal terms commonly exhibited Ergative marking, and so may
layin, which as illustrated has at least in part a kind of classifier-like occurrence and
identificational textual function: ngamanda-yi lany-nyi yimbu-larri 'what kind of
[ngamanda, 'what', ERG] animal bit you?'
   There is, again, considerable variability among the nominals grouped under the
sub-type -Sin, but some generalizations do emerge from the variability. For nominals
ending in -bin, there were two common patterns: reduction of -in, or failure to reduce
where reduction would leave a stem-final cluster (e.g., ABS lalbin 'narrow place', LOG
wu-lalbi-ya 'in the crack'; ABS 'greedy (person)' wujbin, ERG wujbin-yi, PL ABS
wujbin-mulu. For nominals with apical stop (a, rd) as final syllable margin, the most
common pattern (for all kinds of non-zero endings) was again reduction of-in. Examples
are: ABS madin 'language, word', DAT mad-gu, ADV mad-barra; ABS minyardin
'charcoal', LOG minyard-ja; ABS jordjordin 'crazy, mad', PL ABS yi-jordjord-mulu
'mad ones'; ABS yordin 'ashes', DAT yord-gu. It seems, however, that words with
homorganic apical nasal-stop cluster across the syllable margin ought not be included in
this subtype, because they appear to commonly lose only -n, or alternatively fail to
                                                                          Process phonology 31reduce. An example is ABS barndin 'sore', DAT barndi-wii, 'having' forms
barndi-warang, barndin-garang. Consideration of nominals with final -gin shows that
the presence of homorganic nasal-stop cluster is relevant to the form of reduction there
too.
    Nominals ending in -jin seem also to preferentially lose -in, thus clustering with
nominals ending in -b/d/rdin. Examples are ABS wu-jerrijin 'cold weather', ADV
wiijerrij-barra; ABS berngijin 'black soil', LOC berngij-a, ABL berngij-ba etc.
 (' Black soil' and a few other nouns are sometimes treated as collectives, and have special
number- marked stems, see 5.6.3.)
    Nominals ending in -gin also preferentially lose -in, except where this would leave a
stem-final cluster. Where the latter would occur, trisyllabic (or longer) stems with/igg
across syllable margin may reduce the entire final syllable to zero, adding endings directly
to the remaining ng. Examples of the first sort are ABS nniragin ' shade', LOCnnirag-ja;
belgin 'mud', LOC belg-ja; ABS yi-goyogin 'salt water', ALLyi-gayog-arr, LOC
yi-goyog-ja; nvirrgbarrgin 'cramp', ERG njarrgbarrg-ji; ABS larrglarrgin 'light (not
dense) shade', LOC wu-larrglarrg-ja; ABS dulgin' urine', OATdulg-ii'; ABS wii-nurlgin
'hot ashes, live coals', LOC wu-nurlg-ja.
    Despite the relative acceptability of forms such as belg-ja here, that there is some issue
of remaining stem-final clusters is shows by the fact that, while both belg-ja and
belgin-nya 'in the mud' were considered usual and acceptable (and the former is in fact
more frequent), informants refused to accept warlg-ja 'in bed, in the swag', and instead
allowed only warlgin-nya.
    Four nominals in which zeroing of the entire final syllable seems to account for the
usual inflecting stem-form areluyunggin 'smoke', guyanggin 'woomera', warranggin
' corroboree', and balanggin ' new'. Most common case-forms for the former were, e.g.,
ABLluyimg-ba, ALLluyimg-garr; for 'woomera', UOCguyang-nya, ABLgnyang-ba;
for 'corroboree', DAT warrang-git. Alternative forms for all these nominals were
unreduced As noted far above, the noun banggin' back' was never found to reduce (thus,
*bang-nya LOC, was unacceptable). The factor relevant to failure to reduce is evidently
presence of the homorganic nasal-stop cluster, in a bisyllabic stem where such reduction
would remove the homorganic stop. Commonest patterns for different final-syllable
types may be summarized:
     -CVn (where Fis not ι)                     reduce -n
     -Cin
            -M/i                                reduce -in
            -L/RFfin                            reduce -in, also -n
            -Sin (S =stop)                      reduce -in
                    -gin                        as above but may zero syllable where
                                                 preceding segment is ng in trisyllabic
                                                 stems
  At least one word, bornorron 'brolga', which undergoes reduction bornorro-yi ERG,
compares with bornorrong (velar nasal - final) in some other languages of the region,
e.g., Jawoyn, Ngalkbon.
32 Chapters3.5. Fortition and related processesWardaman exhibits surface alternations, some of which must be considered to result from
fortition, or ""hardening"", a process by which a basic sonorant is realized as a stop. There
are several distinguishable, productive processes of this sort; that is, which are
environmentally conditioned, live alternations. An expository problem is that certain of
these, with which this section begins, are closely linked to other processes which operate
at the same boundary — that between pronominal prefix and verb stem — but have
different effects (degemination, deletion, etc.). There are other important fortition
processes of quite different character, which operate elsewhere. My preference is to treat
together the set of processes which operate at boundary between prefix and verb stem,
rather than artificially attempting to group all fortition processes together.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56]"

11.2. Temporal clauses: -barra ~ -warra with finite verbs and
      particles
Dependent clauses meaning 'when, at the time when' may be formed with the suffix
-barra ~ -warra (see 5.4.) from both verbs and verb particles, but in the latter instance
exhibit some of the usual limitations of complement clauses based on particles.
  Temporal clauses with verbs tend to be used to express background conditions in
relation to another clause or series of them, and thus are often constructed with formally
subordinate predicates, as in this example:(654)   gorromogon        ngarr-gurrgba-n-ga-\varra           ya-wud-janga-yan
        early morning     UNPL-sleep-PRES-SUB-ADV             3-3NSG-come-POT
        ""They may come early in the morning when we are sleeping'.
                                             Particles, particle syntax and clausal complements 271  A similar meaning would be expressed by the subordinate verb form without suffix;
but its addition seems to focus on simultaneity of the two actions or conditions expressed
by the predicates of clauses so linked. The suffix may be added to finite verb forms:(655)   nga-njigbe-warra          nana                  ya-0-nyangi-we          yiwarna-gari
        ISG-go-FUT-ADV            that-ABS              3-3SG-come-FUT           other-other
        'When I will go the other fellow will come'.
  The same suffix is added to verb particles, and these function as clause complements:
(1) designating the time at which something took place; or (2) as secondary predicates
with verbs of motion, the kind of action undertaken during or as a result ofthat motion.
In the first usage, the suffix is added to particles designating events, for example:(656)   lilg-ba-warra       barrunin        lag                  0-ngegba-rri
        dryup-ADV           fish-ABS        dessicate            3SG-AUX-PST
        'When it [water] dried, the fish died and dried up'.
  The particle lilg-ba is usually combined with ya- to mean 'dry up', and is often used
in reference to seasonal drying up of water bodies. Such minimal temporal complements
as these differ little from nominals designating seasons and conditions, similarly suffixed,
e.g., wu-jerrij-barra 'when it is cold, in cold-weather time'.
   As secondary predicates with verbs of motion, the complement clause may have a
Dative, semantically direct object, and further nominal complements are also Dative
marked. Common in this function is the particle gej-(ba) 'ask'; as clausal predicate with
finite verb gi~ it takes a direct (animate) object, the person asked.(657)   oliba-wu          0-nyanga-ndi    gej-ba-warra    walbarnda-wu
        [Oliver]-DAT      3SG-come-PST ask-PS-ADV         plain-DAT
        nyangurlang       ya-wu-di-yan            wurren
        when               3-3NSG-bring-POT       child-ABS
        'He came to ask Oliver about the initiation, when they might bring the child'
         [initiand].
  (Here as is often the case, the word meaning ""plain"" or ""flat ground"" is contextually
understood to refer and allude to ""ceremony ground"", and the activity of initiation
conducted there.) Gej-ba-warra has a semantically direct object, the person asked; and
that asked about is also Dative-marked (the nominal ""plain""; the more precise content of
the question is encoded in a clause linked to the preceding by the (usually) interrogative
pronoun ""when"", here functioning as a temporal relativizer.","[294, 295]"
"
1.4. Territory and neighbours
Wardaman people whom I have consulted (see Merlan 1989b, c) identify the larger
Wardaman territory as a rough trapezoid with Scott Creek (Aboriginal name,
Wugimadgun) as an approximate northern boundary, the junction of Scott Creek and the
 Katherine River (Mululeyn) as the north-western extent,2 Romula Knob as an
approximate south-easterly extent, the road crossing of the Victoria River (Langgay) a
south-westerly one, and the rough country rising to the Dry River plateau an approximate
eastern side (see Map 1). Within this larger area they identify a number of Wardaman
territorial ""estates"". Eleven of these appear to be recognized as within the larger
Wardaman country. Yangman country lies to the east and north, on the Dry River and
running back north along major waterways to present Mataranka. The area north of the
junction of Scott Creek and the Katherine River, east to the King River, and north towards
the Ferguson River and Pine Creek, is identified by Katherine Aborigines as Dagoman
tribal territory. The northerly extent of Dagoman country is now difficult to establish,
such has been the disruption of European pastoral and later settlement (see e.g., Powell
 1988:98 on the early founding of Springvale Station 1876-1879 on the Katherine River
near the present town site, also Maff n.d.), and the accompanying diminution of numbers
and the salience of ""Dagoman"" as a socio-territorial identity. Though older Wardaman,
at least, clearly recognize that Manbulloo Station (just outside Katherine to the south-
west) is in Dagoman country, such has been their length of association with the area and
with other Aborigines living there, that they have a strong sense of attachment to it.
   Despite the linguistic closeness of Wardaman and Yangman, it would seem that in the
post-contact period, most Yangman had more to do with the Mangarrayi in the vicinity
of Elsey Station, than with the Wardaman. The Wardaman apparently associated more
than the Yangman in post-European times with Victoria River peoples, who came north
and worked on Delamere, Willeroo and Manbulloo Stations. Except for a small number
of Wardaman who worked at Victoria River Downs and southern stations, these three
properties have had a crucial role in the particular contact history of the Wardaman.
  Willeroo had been taken up early as a pastoral property, but the homestead was
temporarily abandoned when the first manager, Scott, was killed by Aborigines (Maff
n.d., p. 20). Soon after the lease was bought by TomPearce (see Spencer 1914), formerly
a publican in Katherine, and the station was developed as a cattle property. This was in
2. According to Ngamunugarri and Elsie Raymond, there is a second site of the same name on
   Mathison Creek, i.e. two sites are similarly named as what they regard as approximate western
   and eastern extents of Wardaman country.
8 Chapter 1a period of considerable development of stations to the south and west: Wave Hill and
Victoria River Downs. Delamere had been taken up early (1893) by a developer, Browne,
who also owned the Springvale lease near Katherine (the latter was passed in after failure
to successfully establish stock and particularly sheep there, in 1896). With the growth
of a cattle station at Manbulloo, and its purchase together with Willeroo and Delamere
by Vesteys Northern Properties, the stage was set for these three properties to be a
constellation among which Wardaman were shifted around by management, depending
on season and the work to be done. So it happens that many Wardaman today have great
familiarity with Willeroo and Manbulloo. Many people, especially older ones, also spent
periods of time at Delamere. Most Wardaman men until recently grew up learning to
work cattle, and most women grew up doing domestic work for the station and living in
the Aboriginal camps associated with all of these properties.
  The early period of initial ""contact"" with Europeans, here as in the Victoria River
District generally, had been one of considerable violence. An atmosphere had been
created, and persisted, in which the Aborigines could not be at all confident of the
benevolence of Europeans. For their part, the European station personnel seem to have
been mainly concerned with the Aborigines as workers (and to some extent, with the
women as sexual partners). They made little attempt to create comfortable conditions in
the Aboriginal camps — indeed, living conditions in the camp at Willeroo were very
poor through the 1970s, the last period during which Aborigines lived there in numbers
and for extended periods. While there, Aborigines were dependent on European transport
to town.
  Overall, the Wardaman at Willeroo, and possibly also at Delamere, seem to have been
living to a great extent on their own social resources, though they were dependent upon
the stations for subsistence. There appears to have been close and intense camp life at
the station, and considerable walk-about over the station during periods of stand-down
from work. Both forms of life were characterized by persistent use of the Wardaman
language. Those who came in to work, and/or married in, from elsewhere, tended to be
from Victoria River or other neighbouring peoples (such as Mudbura), and either spoke,
or learned to speak, Wardaman.
  These seem to have been the conditions which at least partly account for the persistence
of active speakership by older people, and the rather full knowledge on the part of some
younger people, of Wardaman today. Though the effects of the town context in which
most now live are not entirely clear, it seems very likely that, overall, life between the
camps and town does not offer the same sustained intensity and kinds of interaction with
a manageable number of well-known others, which seems to have been significant in
language retention throughout the station period.
  Most Wardaman now live in and around Katherine. A few men continue to do seasonal
stockwork, mostly in the Victoria River District, but also in the Roper River region. Some
families continue to attend religious ceremony, again mainly in the Victoria River area;
but there has also been some effort on the part of town-dwelling Wardaman to conduct
young men's initiations near Katherine town, and thus to establish it as a ceremonial
destination for the countrymen of the Victoria River region, and other parts of the
Katherine hinterland.

1.5. Research on the language, fieldwork and informantsThere is only a small amount of published linguistic material on Wardaman. There are
also some earlier, unpublished sources.
  Gerhard Laves (MS) worked with Wardaman speakers in Darwin, and the resulting
material is now lodged in a larger file of his field notes at the Australian Institute of
Aboriginal Studies, Canberra (now the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait
Islander Studies)3.
  Capell (1962) published a paradigm of the Wardaman transitive prefix combinations
as part of his work on ""pronominalization"" in Australian languages. A very large number
of the prefix forms given by Capell are inaccurate. Though it is pointless to run through
a catalogue of discrepancies here, an important thing to note is that in some of Capell's
forms, what I shall call the ""accusative"" marker -n- is inaccurately reported For
example, he cites the transitive combination 2SG/3SG as>yin-. It should actually beyi-,
with quite different implications for the structure of the system than if the first form were
correct.
  Before I began field work in 1976, Kenneth Hale made available to me some pages of
field notes he recorded in 1959 in the Alice Springs area, where he worked with an
informant who had some knowledge of Wardaman. This preliminary information was
very useful, and I am grateful for his generosity in making it available to me.
  I initially did fieldwork on Wardaman in 1976, from March to November, and for
periods in 1978. Fieldwork was conducted mainly in Katherine town around the fringe
camps, for though there were still some Wardaman people living at Willeroo in 1976,
station management was hostile to my living there or even visiting at the station camp.
I worked with some Wardaman people living in what were then called the ""New Homes"",
the first housing within the town itself to be explicitly made available to Aboriginal
families (from 1970). In particular, I came regularly to the New Homes to work with
Elsie Raymond (Nonomarran), who overall has been a principal informant for my
research, and some of her relatives, including her own mother Maggie Sing
(Birriwalngali, who has since passed away), Maggie's husband Tarpot Ngamunugarri,
Elsie's close ""second"" mother Ruby Allison (Gomnyang) who passed away in 1991, and
the latter's husband, also deceased. Other main informants during this early period were
two old men, both of whom have since passed away, who variously lived at Manbulloo
Station and at the ""High Level"" town camp on the northern fringe of Katherine. These
were Jabiru (Luwungmirr), and Old Gregory (Darlunggag). Neither man considered
himself ""full"" Wardaman, but both were fluent speakers of the language. Especially the
latter was considered by Wardaman people to have rich knowledge of matters relating to
country, mythology, and contact history. He was probably born around 1906, and spent
a large part of his working life at Manbulloo Station, apparently carrying over from
Dagoman people there information concerning their early contact history in the
immediate Katherine area which is no longer widely known. In this initial period I also
did research on other Aboriginal languages of the Katherine area.
3. I am grateful to David Nash for having brought the Laves material to my attention and supplied
photocopies of the Wardaman sheets.
10 Chapter 1  During 1977 I mainly worked around Mataranka and at the Aboriginal community on
Elsey Station, which was then called Djembere (now Jilkminggan, /jilgmirn.gan/),
collecting material on both Yangman and Mangarrayi (Merlan 1982). By early 1977 I
had written a preliminary draft of a Wardaman grammar, with appended 57 pages of
text. This remained unpublished, however, lodged in the library at the Australian Institute
of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, Canberra.
  It was not until 1988 and 1989 that I did some further intensive work on Wardaman, in
short periods each year. One of the principal results of this work was the addition of a
considerable amount of text material, concentrating on the mythology of sites on Willeroo
Station (that we were then able to visit owing to a change in station management), on
people's accounts of their lives and experiences, and oral history of the early pastoral
period. I was also able to do systematic checking of compiled grammatical and lexical
material.
  From 1988 I have also done more work with certain Wardaman people I knew from
the earlier period, but with whom I had not previously worked, or with whom I had only
worked occasionally. In the latter category are Lily Gin.gina and her mother Daisy
Gimiyn, on whom I relied increasingly for text material and some lexical checking. In
the former category is Claude Manbulloo (Yirdirdiman), who previously was absent from
Katherine for long periods on station work. In the last couple of years he has supplied
interesting material, textual and other, particularly on the area of Wardaman country to
which he is patrifilated, around Willeroo homestead. Over the years I got assistance in
language elicitation and in much else from his aunt, Nayda (Waramburr), who passed
away in 1991.
  I owe a particular debt to Elsie Raymond. Among the Wardaman, she has always been
the most prolific story-teller and recounter of history, genealogy, mythology, and all sorts
of information relating to past and present, that I have worked with. From her I have
gathered my most extensive textual material, and from her also I have constantly gotten
new lexical information as she has thought about our language work and made mental
notes of new things to tell me. She has also always encouraged her other relatives to help
with certain aspects of the work: in particular, she always enlisted both her mothers and
her father to help me with 'stories' and information of all sorts. Though her personality
and mentality are quicksilver, and therefore I think at times she has found it trying to
persist through elicitation and checking of grammatical forms, she has done so,
sometimes for hours on end, and sat with me to encourage others to do so. Over the last
couple of years I have gotten much help from her eldest son Oliver Raymond in text
transcription, and increasingly also, I was assisted in transcription by her second mother
Ruby Allison, and also Philomena (Ngelgerrej), Ruby's mother's brother's daughter and
Elsie's uncle's mother's brother's daughter.
  At various times in the early 1980s, Bill Harney (Yidumduma) made time and special
effort to help me locate sites on Manbulloo Station. He has been helpful in many ways
in the recent periods of my work as well.
  This description is written in gratitude for the help I have gotten from all these people,
and is for them and their families.

2.1. Phonemes and their realizationA practical orthography is used throughout this description. So far as I know, Wardaman
has not been written and no other practical spelling system has ever been devised for it.

10.14. Particle function and position in clause and tone groupThere is a tendency for particles to occur immediately preceding the finite verb with
which they are in construction, but as in Wakiman (Cook 1987: 241), this is not their
invariable position. The usual positioning, amply illustrated throughout this grammar,
is of the following sort:(609) narru        wurr-waja-rri-ya                wonggo              balyag
       dodge       3NSG-AUX-PSTONAR                neg                 touch
       0-me-ndi-ya         ngawun
       3SG-AUX-PST-NAR no
        'They dodged and it did not touch them'.
  However, within a tone group comprised of a single clause and as well, within complex
or multi-clause tone groups, the alternative positioning is commonly found:(610) gam-gu           wurr-waja-rri-ya            narru
      spear-DAT        3NSG-AUX-PST-NAR            dodge
        'They dodged the spears'.
 The following examples (drawn from texts) illustrate the alternative positioning:(611)   wurr-yana-rri         gunga             memde-wu       nan-gu
