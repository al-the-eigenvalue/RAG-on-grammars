24.1. Word order at a clause levelUdihe exhibits certain typological features of a head-final SOV language: a
head-final noun phrase (Chapter 13) and relative clause (19.1), a left-branching
complement embedded clause before the matrix verb (Chapter 20),
postpositions (10.2), etc. Indeed, the SOV order is the most common
statistically as well. The typical SOV order is illustrated by examples below.(1765) a.   Mamasa       ule:-we           olokto-ini.
            old.woman meat-ACC            cook-3SG
            'The old woman is cooking meat.'
       b.   Omölo-i              wopti-we           kimpigi-e-ni.
            granddaughter-1SG door-ACC             close-PAST-3SG
            'My granddaughter closed the door.'
       c.   Cinda-ziga           jegdige           ag'a-du         kuge-we

            blow.PAST-3PL
            'The birds blew (the fire) with bellows for the brother hero.'
            (SKX 76)   Cross-linguistically, subject is known to correlate with topic information
structure status, while the direct object is likely to encode the focus (in the
sense of narrow focus). The SOV order in Udihe seems to be a result of three
independent requirements: (i) the preverbal position of the focus (24.1.1), (ii)
subject/topic initiality (24.1.2), and (iii) verb finality (24.1.3). Requirement (i)
appears to be inviolable, therefore, when an element other than the direct object
corresponds to the focus function, the SOV order is abandoned. Requirements
(ii) and (iii) can easily be violated. As a result, the SOV order appears
non-rigid, deviations being motivated by specific information structure
requirements.

            Information structure and word order
This chapter deals with the effects of information structuring on the surface
shape of the clause. We assume that the information structure is an independent
level of clause representation that deals with the ""packaging"" of the
information in the utterance. The relevant units of the information structure
here considered as primitives are topic and focus. In their definition we will
rely heavily on the practice of Lambrecht (1994) where they are identified in
relation to one another and to the corresponding proposition. Topic will be
understood as the subject about which the proposition is pragmatically
construed (Lambrecht 1994: 131). The existence of a topic participant is
presupposed by the speaker, so topic is always (a part of) the pragmatic
presupposition of the utterance. Focus will be understood as ""the semantic
component of a pragmatically structured proposition whereby the assertion
differs from the presupposition"" (Lambrecht 1994: 213). If the presupposition
is lacking, the focus and the assertive part of the utterance coincide. Thus,
every sentence has a focus, but not every sentence necessarily has a topic (if it
lacks a pragmatic presupposition). Roughly speaking, sentence elements that
do not correspond to the functions of topic and focus may be viewed as neutral
with respect to information structure.
   Although, strictly speaking, the notions ""topic"" and ""focus"" refer to relations
at the level of information structure, we will use these terms to refer to the
corresponding elements of the clause as well. Topic normally corresponds to a
non-verbal constituent whose referent is mentioned in the discourse, although
new topics are possible as well. As distinct from the topic, focus can
correspond not only to the nominal constituent, but to a verbal constituent as
well.
   We will further assume that information structure functions stand in a certain
mapping relationship to syntactic and semantic units. However, this is a matter
of considerable controversy, and no attempt will be made to describe here such
mapping relationships in Udihe. This chapter only concentrates on the
correspondences between a particular information structure status and the
linear order of the sentence elements. As demonstrated below, word order in
Udihe is primarily motivated by information structure considerations, although
grammatical information is also relevant.
   Section 24.1 deals with word order at a clause level. Additional information
about word order can also be found in other chapters, particularly those on
840 Information structure and word orderquestions and negation (Chapter 23), on the adverbs (10.1.7), and the particles
(Chapter 12). Word order within a regular NP is treated in Chapter 13.
   In some cases the information structure, together with semantics, conditions
the sentence construction, that is, the encoding of semantic units by
grammatical relations. Some remarks on this may be found in Chapter 16 on
the valence-changing operations. Such alternative constructions at the level of
the clause were discussed in Chapter 16. In section 24.2 we address the word
order and information structure driven alternative encoding of sentence
elements within a noun phrase, while in 24.3 we focus on copular
constructions.","[874, 875, 876]"

                                   Syntax
Udihe is a head-final SOV language. However, head-finality is not rigid. In
some noun phrases, such as the possessive phrase, the head-final order is
obligatory. Other noun phrases demonstrate a split in head properties: in certain
constructions attributes may raise to the phrase-final position and receive some
other head properties (24.2.1.1). Postpositional phrases and non-finite clauses
are always head-final. In the matrix clause the word order is largely motivated
by information structure. The most important requirement for word order at a
clause level is the immediately preverbal position of the focus element
(including the question words) (24.1.1).
   Major grammatical relations, such as the subject, direct object, and indirect
object, are rather easily identified by a cluster of grammatical properties
(Chapter 15). In particular, the subject is a grammatical element associated
with the highest syntactic activity and is the main controller of coreferential
relations, both within the clause and clause-externally. The verb only agrees
with the subject. A number of rules that change grammatical relations apply
(Chapterló). The case marking patterns are uniformly based on the Accusative
system with the following two exceptions. First, the direct object marked with
the reflexive-possessive affix stands in the Nominative (22.3.2). Second, the
single argument of certain constructions denoting state may be encoded by the
Accusative noun phrase (17.2.2.5.2).
   The subordinate clause mostly makes use of non-finite verbal forms,
participles, converbs, and infinitives. Clause-chaining is organized around the
switch-reference system, which opposes same-subject and different-subject
relationships (22.5). They are morphologically encoded on the non-finite verbal
forms employed in the subordinate clause. Relative clauses are formally
patterned as attributive noun phrase (Chapter 19), complement clauses as
possessive noun phrases with participles taking corresponding case and
possessive affixes (Chapter 20).
                               Chapter 13
                               Noun phrase
A noun phrase consists of a head and an optional modifier. The following
grammatical classes function as nominal heads: nouns and pro-nouns (personal
pronouns, possessive pronouns, and indefinite pronouns, see Chapter 9). In
headless noun phrases the head noun is omitted, while cardinal numerals,
quantifiers, adjectives, pro-adjectives, and the relative clause undergo
nominalization. These cases are not treated in this chapter (on the headless
relative clause see section 19.5, and on the headless noun phrase see 22.2.3).
Pro-nouns do not take a modifier, with the exception of the relative clause.
Ordinary nouns may function as attributive forms only when there is a
possessive relation between them and the head. Some exceptions are addressed
in 13.7.
   The following classes of modifiers are available: pro-nouns (that is, Personal
pronouns), adjectives, pro-adjectives (Demonstrative and indefinite Pronouns),
quantifiers, postpositional phrases, oblique-case noun phrases, and the relative
clause. The relative clause is discussed in Chapter 19. Articles are missing, and
definiteness may be expressed by means of 3rd person possessive affixes
(4.3.1.1). Head nomináis cannot be modified by a simple adverbial. Adjectival
modification may also be performed by the derivational affixes -ziga (5.1.1.1)
and -ηΑ: (5.1.1.5).
   The noun phrase is typically head-final. However, under certain information
structure driven conditions the order within particular noun phrases is reversed:
the modifier occupies the phrase-final position and is characterized by certain
other head properties. This process will be referred to as ""modifier raising"" and
is addressed in 24.2.1.1. As shown there, modifier raising is observed in the
situation when the modifier and the head noun bear different information
structure statuses. In this chapter we will only focus on noun phrases that are
""neutral"" (not partitioned) from the point of view of information structure, and
that correspondingly do not demonstrate modifier raising. Yet, even in this
case, head-finality is not rigid. Certain classes of modifiers - the postpositional
phrase, the oblique-case noun phrase, and certain appositions - are always
postnominal, independent of any information structure considerations, so
head-finality is violated. Other modifiers (numerals and some other quantifiers)
may be prenominai and postnominal without being raised. The word order
within noun phrases with each individual modifier is discussed in the
480   Noun phrase
corresponding sections, while section 13.10 focuses on word order within a
noun phrase with several modifiers.
  The syntactic relationship between the head and the modifier is encoded
morphologically only in certain types of noun phrase: the possessive noun
phrase (13.1) and the phrase where the modifier corresponds to the indefinite
pronoun (9.6). Otherwise the modifier is merely juxtaposed to the head noun.
The only lexical material that may be inserted between the head and the
modifier are focus particles, cf.:(925) Sita-i           tene     bugdi-le-ni               su:ne:-k.
      child-REF        CONT leg-LOC-3SG                   string.PAST-EXPR
      'He strung his child's legs.'","[508, 509, 510, 511, 512, 513, 514]"
"
24.1.1. Focus positionThe most important requirement of Udihe word order is the preverbal position
of the focus element. In a clause that does not involve any constituents other
than SOV, this, under normal discourse conditions, results in the preverbal
position of the object. The reason for this is that in such sentences the object
typically corresponds to the focus function, while the subject normally
corresponds to the topic function. In clauses with a more complicated structure,
the focus element is necessarily strictly preverbal independently of its semantic
role. Other elements are located either before the focus element or after the
verb. Different cases are exemplified below.
   The focus element (especially the focus that bears an additional contrastive
implication) is highlighted by a high pitch intonation. In the translations we
will capitalize the element that corresponds to the focus function.",[877]

1.5.2.2.2. GrammarThe modern Udihe use very many Russian words in their speech, and it is not
clear whether these should be classified as loanwords or as phonological
""quotations"" from another language. Russian words are easily combined with
Udihe grammatical morphemes. An example of such ""macaronical"" speech is
the following sentence spontaneously produced by one of our informants
(televizor and vkluci- are Russian words for 'television' and 'switch on',
respectively):(20)   Sikie     televizora      vekluci-la:-mi                    ei-de
       evening television        switch.on-V.PAST-lSG             NEG-FOC

                                       The effect on language contacts on Udihe   23
   However, the influence of Russian on Udihe syntax at the structural level is
surprisingly small compared to other minority languages of Siberia and the
Russian Far East. The following points can be noted here:
   (i) Younger speakers tend to follow the Russian word order. In particular,
they place the focus object in a post-verbal position, which violates the major
requirement of Udihe word order, namely, the preverbal position of the focus
element (24.1.1). In general, the fact that verb-finality in modern Udihe is not
rigid (24.1) may be due to the influence of Russian word order. The example
below illustrates a non-head-final embedded clause generally disallowed in
Udihe but which in this case appeared under Russian influence.","[56, 57]"
"
12.1.1.3.3. The emphatic focus functionThe particle -dA can be used in order to emphasize the assertion associated
with the corresponding element without bringing about the additive meaning.
In other words, the element within its scope expresses new information that is
not necessarily construed as ""additive"". Such a focus particle takes scope over
any sort of constituent, for example, a subject (845), a predicate (846), and a
postpositional phrase (847). It easily co-occurs with other elements that
normally bear the focus in the sentence, such as the negative auxiliary (848a), a
quantified NP (848b), or an emphatic reflexive pronoun (848c).",[476]
"The following example illustrates a rather infrequent word order: the ideophone
is separated from the verb by Instrumental nouns.",[416]
"(1210) Tehu-ni         bih-ni          eze-xi.
       all-3Sg         be-3SG          master-PROP
       'Everybody has a master.' (SK 940)In contrast, no other elements intervene between the two components of the
analytical verbal category, and their order cannot be changed.
   The copula in copular constructions behaves like regular verbs in the matrix
or the subordinate clause with respect to word order and morphology. It takes
the corresponding tense/aspect/mood or non-finite form and is marked for
subject agreement. In section 17.1 we will describe the various types of copula.
   Predicative elements of copular constructions usually belong to one of the
following morphological classes: adjectives, nouns, some participles, or in rare
cases, adverbs. In 17.2 different copular constructions are presented according
to the valence patterns and further subtypes of the predicative element.
   A number of copular constructions undergo formal restructuring due to
processes of topicalization or focalization; these are addressed in 24.3.",[643]

                       Grammatical relations
This chapter presents the major characteristics of Udihe syntax in terms of
grammatical relations. Grammatical relations will be identified here as
syntactic elements that exhibit certain grammatical properties. These properties
concern, first, the form and position of the corresponding element in the clause,
and second, its ability to determine the form and the position of other elements
within the same clause or clause-externally. In this chapter, however, the
position of the elements within the clause is not addressed. Word order in
Udihe is conditioned by information structure rather than by grammatical
relations and is dealt with in the chapter on information structure (Chapter 24).
   Section 15.1 focuses on the most important grammatical relation, the subject.
Section 15.2. deals with the direct object. Other arguments are briefly
mentioned in 15.3 but are not dealt with in detail. They are described in
Chapter 14 according to the valence patterns of the verbs. On the other hand, in
section 15.4 we present a detailed description of clausal adjuncts according to
their semantic types. Operations that alternate grammatical relations within the
clause are addressed in Chapter 16.","[567, 568, 569]"
"
24.2.2.2. Modifier in focusIf the destinative object takes a modifier other than the destinative modifier (for
example, an adjective) it may be focused. As was argued in 24.1.1, the major
requirement of Udihe word order is the preverbal position of the focus element,
with the result that certain focus modifiers must be placed in the preverbal
position. This results in the discontinuous noun phrase (24.2.1.2). For
destinative constructions another strategy applies: the focus modifier within the
destinative noun phrase does not occupy the strictly preverbal position, but
modifies the Accusative object located in the preverbal position. The object,
therefore, is syntactically ""doubled"" as the Accusative object located in the
preverbal position and as the Destinative object (normally clause-initial). The
latter corresponds to the presuppositional (topical) part of the utterance.(1812) a.   Bi men-e              suese-ne-mi              aja       suese-we

"       Κ   = Kormusin (1998)
       SK  = Simonov and Kjalundzjuga (1998)
       SKX = Simonov, Kjalundzjuga, and Xasanova (1998-1999)The materials of the Northern dialect are cited using a phonological
transcription. This differs from the transcription originally used in the sources,
which was partly phonetic and in most cases employed the Cyrillic alphabet.
   Sentence examples are provided in phonological transcription with morpheme-
by-morpheme glosses and functionally equivalent English translations. Words in
the translations that are absent in the example are bracketed, except for personal
pronouns. For the sake of economy, the personal pronouns, which are not marked
for gender in Udihe, are all translated as 'he'. In the glosses the 1st person personal
pronoun is indicated as 'me'. Russian proper names, and other terms that remain
untranslated, are cited in the international transliteration system, while local
vili Prefacenames are transliterated into English as they are found in English-language
geographical reference books. For polysemantic Udihe words the glosses give the
meaning appropriate to the given context, so the same word may be glossed in
several ways. For example, the Udihe word egdi may be glossed either as 'many'
or as 'much', and the postposition edeisini may be glossed either as 'if or 'when',
depending on the context.
   Morphemes are separated with hyphens in both the Udihe text and the glosses.
Stems are glossed by English lexical words, while other morphemes are glossed
with abbreviations of category labels. When more than one English word is
required to translate a Udihe word, they are linked by a period. The grammatical
category that is not expressed by means of a separate morpheme is not reflected in
the glosses, partly for reasons of economy, and partly because the decision on the
presence or absence of the morphological null may sometimes be controversial.
However, when two separate morphs are contracted to one for phonological
reasons, this is indicated by a period in the glosses. Thus in the following
examples convention (a) will be used instead of (b), or (c).(a)    Sagdä-rji-mi     mo:      bede     ute-ne:-mi ( *— utene-e-mi).
       old-V-INF        tree     like     rotten.tree-V.PAST-lSG
       Ί grew decrepit like an old tree.'
(b)    Sagdä-qi-mi      mo:               bede     ute-ne:-mi.
       old-V-INF        tree:NOM:SG like           rotten.tree-V:PAST-lSG
(c)    Sagdä-iji-mi     mo:-0             bede     ute-ne:-mi.
       old-V-INF        tree-NOM:SG like           rotten.tree-V:PAST-lSGThe period is also used for those few ""portmanteau"" morphs that do not result
from phonological contraction at the synchronic level, for example, -li
<CC.SS> (Conditional converb, same-subject), and -lie <CC.SS.PL>
(Conditional Converb, same-subject, Plural).
  Examples that only make up a fragment of a sentence are glossed in arrow
brackets. In the translations of some examples we have included a grammatical
specification of the meaning in round brackets. This is not intended as a gloss,
but rather to facilitate understanding of the translation, for example:       zugdi-tigi        'to the house (LAT)' or <house-LAT>Unlike nominal stems, bare verbal stems are cited with a hyphen, for example
zìi:- 'saw' (a verb) versus zü: 'saw' (a noun). Embedded clauses are indicated
by square brackets.
   The grammar is intended to be a more or less comprehensive description. It
follows the traditional structure: general introduction - phonology -
morphology - syntax - texts - vocabulary - indexes. Much use is made of
cross-references between the various chapters and sections. The morphological
description is organized around inflectional and derivational forms. The
                                                                     Preface   ix
functions of some of these may be addressed in separate sections within the
corresponding chapters. The syntactic part is mostly organized around various
syntactic units such as, for example, the noun phrase, relative clause, adverbial
clause and so on, but in some cases we also follow the function-to-form
approach.
    The grammar is not biased towards any particular theoretical framework,
although in several cases we choose to explain within the text the basis of the
notions used in the description. The terminology is intended to be theory-
independent. The names of particular grammatical categories typical of Udihe
are capitalized; adjectives derived from these, as well as general grammatical
and semantic notions, are in lower case, for example, ""Possessive suffix"" (the
suffix of the grammatical category Possessive) and ""possessive construction"",
""possessive form"", and ""possessive meaning"".

                              Introduction
1.1. The Udihe language and its genetic affiliationUdihe (other spellings used are Udehe, Udegej, Udege, Udeghe, Udige,
Udighe, LJde) is a Tungus language spoken as a first language by
approximately 100 people, all over 50 years old, in the southern part of the
Russian Far East (see 1.2.3 for more information on the number of speakers
and 1.2.4 on its geographical location). Udihe is divided into two dialects each
with several local variants (1.3). Despite a lack of official status or written
tradition, several attempts have been made to create a writing system for use in
schools (1.6.2, 1.6.3).
   The Tungus (Tungus-Manchu) language family is widely assumed to be a
branch of Altaic. The scheme in (1) represents the classification of the Tungus
languages as accepted in Vasilevic (1960) and Sunik (1962: 16-20, 1968: 54,
1997: 154). The alternative classifications either group together the Manchu
and Southern Tungus languages (Cincius 1949; Benzing 1955: 9-10; Menges
1978: 370; Comrie 1981: 58) or treat Northern Tungus, Southern Tungus, and
Manchu as three independent branches (Avrorin 1959-1961). On some other
classifications and/or comparisons between them see Menges (1968: 25-30),
Ikegami (1974), Doerfer (1978), Vovin (1993), and Miller (1994).","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35]"
"
24.1.1.1. Question wordsQuestion words are universally known to be pragmatically and formally
associated with the focus. In Udihe, the position of the question word is
necessarily strictly preverbal. On exceptions see 23.1.1.6. Examples of
preverbal question words, clause-initial (1766) and non clause-initial (1767) are
cited below.(1766) a.   I:-le      b'a-i                  si        mamasa-na-mi?
            what-LOC find.PAST-2SG            you      wife-DEST-REF
            'WHERE did you find a wife for yourself?' (K 146)

            'WHO ate the fish again?' (K 148)
842 Information structure and word order24.1.1.2. Subject focusWhen the subject bears a focus status, the possible word orders are OSV
(1768a) or SVO (1768b). In (1768b)-(1768c) the focus bears an additional
contrastive implication.(1768) a.   Ei kusige-we         min-du        Iwana bu-ge.
            this knife-ACC       me-give       Ivan    give-PERF
            'This knife was given to me by IVAN.'
       b.   Komo,        si     zomi:          bi       sugzä:-iji-we-i?

"
24.1.1.3. Adverbial elements in focusCertain (predicate) adverbials are likely to correspond to the focus function and
are therefore mostly found in the immediately pre verbal position (cf. 10.1.7.1).
Examples of the pre verbal focus on the instrumental noun phrase (1769a), the
temporal adverb (1769b), and on manner adverbs (1770) are cited below. As
can be seen, the direct object is separated from the verb by the focus element
(1770).(1769) a.   Jogoso        tene    asi     karjgäs'a        mo:    uli-we

            do-INF       catch-SUBJ-lSG
            Ί will catch you this night ANYWAY.' (K 145)When degree adverbials and quantifiers within a noun phrase bear the focus
function, they are located immediately before the verb, while the head noun is
postposed (see section 24.2.1.2 on discontinuous constituents).","[878, 879]"
"
20.2.3.2.3. The verb kaja- 'send, order'The verb kaja- has two valence patterns with slightly different meanings: it
takes the Accusative argument in the meaning 'send', and the Lative argument
in the meaning 'order'; in both cases this argument controls the complement
clause; compare (1483) and (1484).(1483) a.   Enirje-i             min-e-we          kaja:-ni

            of creeper).'
       b.   Jegdige       min-e-we       kaja:-ni                si

            'The hero sent me to ask (you to give him) your daughter.' (K 158)(1484) Wakca-na-laga-ti                    kaja:-mi                bi
       [hunt-DIR-PURP-3PL                  order.PAST-lSG]         me
       nua-ti-tigi.
       he-PL-LAT
       Ί ordered them to go hunting.'",[759]
"""Stylistic variations"" in the length and quality of the word-final Iii (2.1.5) are
also conditioned by emphatic stress. The lengthened final Iii bears the primary
stress.
   In general, the emphatic stress and the presence of different styles of
pronunciation make the identification of stress exceedingly complicated.
                               Morphology
Udihe exhibits a rather high degree of morphological synthesis. The
inflectional grammatical classes have more than one morpheme per word. A
number of grammatical morphemes are semantically equivalent to separate
lexical items in the European languages, cf., for example, wakca-na-mu:i-
 'want to go to hunt' where -nA- is the Directive verbal suffix which indicates
movement in order to accomplish the action specified by the verbal stem, and
-mu:i- is the Desiderative affix. Yet a ""polysynthetic"" combination of a large
number of morphemes within one word is not possible. Theoretically, the
nominal word may include at most six morphemes (the root, the derivational
affix, the Alienable Possessive suffix, the Possessive affix, the number affix
and case affix), and the verbal word may include six or seven morphemes (the
root, three or four derivational affixes, tense/mood, and agreement). In practice,
however, such cases are rarely found, and the noun normally contains no more
than three or four morphemes, and the verb contains no more than five
morphemes.
   The morphological structure of Udihe is characterized by a certain level of
agglutination. Typically, the words can be easily divided into a linear sequence
of distinct morphs, each of which has a fairly consistent shape and a single
function. The agglutination, however, is not absolute; in many cases the
boundaries between the morphemes are not clear-cut, and several grammatical
meanings are combined within one ""portmanteau"" morph. This is mostly due to
the various morphological alternations described in 2.3. One example is the
frequent conflation of the /-final stem or affix with the following /-initial
morpheme. Thus, the 1st person Possessive affix -/ (e.g. anda 'friend', anda-i
'my friend') conflates with the preceding Iii within the Lative inflection -tigi
(anda-tigi-i <friend-LAT-lSG> —> anda-tigi: 'to my friend'). This creates a
'portmanteau' morph -tigi: which indicates both the Lative and the 1st person
singular. Some morphemes, however, have several grammatical functions, and
this is not a result of morphonological alternations (at least at the synchronic
level). For example, the suffix (')-si marks both the Perfective Converb and the
same-subject switch-reference relation (7.5.2.3.2).
   The only type of affixes found in Udihe are suffixes, that is, all bound
morphemes follow the root. Although synthesis predominates in the expression
of grammatical meanings, a few analytical constructions are present. Certain
aspectual, temporal, and modal categories are formed with the auxiliary verb
(see Chapter 7). Other morphological processes are reduplication,
98   Noun inflectional   morphology
compounding and conversion. Overall, incorporation is not typical; some
incorporation-like phenomena are addressed in 6.4.1.2.2, 8.3, and 10.1.3.1.1.
  The major open word classes (nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) can be
easily distinguished by morphological and syntactic criteria.
                            Chapter 4
                  Noun inflectional morphology
Nouns are characterized by the grammatical categories of number, case, and
possession. Syntactically they function as arguments (Chapter 14), adjuncts
(15.3), modifiers (Chapter 13), or predicates in copular constructions (Chapter
17). The absolute majority of nouns in Udihe have the prototypical nominal
meaning: they denote physical objects, either countable entities or uncountable
mass notions. Very few nouns denote abstract notions, such as states, activities,
results or qualities, cf.: teluqu 'story\jexe 'song, singing', boko 'color', and
zima 'visit'. Normally words with abstract meanings correspond to adjectives
or verbs in non-finite forms.","[129, 130, 131, 132, 133]"
"
24.2.1. Non-possessive noun phraseHere we focus on the alternative organization of the modified non-possessive
noun phrase, mostly those in which the modifier corresponds to an adjective or
a quantifier. As was argued in Chapter 13, the noun phrase is normally
head-final. Attributive agreement in case is absent, while agreement in number
                                  Information structure within the noun phrase    847is optional (13.2.2). The relation between the head and the non-possessive
modifier is not encoded by any special morphological device. However, under
conditions driven mainly by considerations of information structure there may
be variance in word order and the encoding of the attributive relationship
within a noun phrase.
   Generally speaking, the regular organization of the noun phrase described in
Chapter 13 is observed when both the modifier and the head noun bear the
same status in the information structure (topic, focus, or neutral). This results in
the noun phrase being unpartitioned from the point of view of information
structure. When their statuses differ, either the modifier is raised (24.2.1.1), or
the noun phrase is organized discontinuously (24.2.1.2).","[882, 883]"

"Almost every element of the superordinate clause, therefore, can be relativized
with the help of the active participle. It does not seem possible to relativize the
adverbial syntactic positions expressed by a postpositional phrase and the standard
of comparison. Examples of relativization into a subordinate clause are missing
and we will assume that even if they are theoretically possible, they are extremely
unusual in Udihe.
   The Passive, Resultative, and Destinative Participles are inherently oriented to
express a particular participant of the situation - a patient/theme (passive
participle, but see exceptions in experiencer of the resultative situation
(Resultative Participle), or an object destined for action (Destinative Participles).
Therefore in relative clauses with these types of participles only these particular
roles are relativized.
   There are three major types of relative clause - external, internal, and
discontinuous, described in sections 19.1, 19.2, and 19.3, respectively. They use
different formal strategies with respect to the position of the participle and in
marking the syntactic role of the relativized noun. The external relative clause is
prenominai and uses the so-called gapping strategy, that is, the grammatical role
of the relativized noun is not overtly indicated within the relative clause but
corresponds to the syntactic gap. In the internal relative clause the participle is
postnominal and corresponds to the syntactic head of the relative clause, while a
relativized noun is internal to the relative. In the discontinuous clause the
relativized noun and the relative clause are not adjacent to each other. There are
no syntactic and/or semantic restrictions on forming external and internal types of
relative clause; both strategies apply to all grammatical relations accessible to
relativization. The discontinuous clause is a marginal type, which allows only the
subject and the direct object to relativize. Within each strategy there are additional
formal differences between the cases in which the head noun corresponds to the
subject of the relative clause, and in which the head noun does not coincide with
the subject of the relative clause.
   From the communicative point of view, internal and discontinuous relative
clauses seem to involve the topicalization of the relativized noun (on the notion of
topic and topicalization of other sentence elements see Chapter 24). In fact, they
are structurally similar to other postnominal modifiers available when the head
                                                               External strategy 675noun is topicalized (24.2.1). Semantically, it appears that only internal and
discontinuous relative clauses may be non-restrictive, while a restrictive
interpretation is possible for all three types.
   The word order within the relative clause may vary, but its predicate always
occupies the last linear position, while its subject (if different from the head noun)
must be clause-initial within the external relative. However, this is not necessarily
so within the internal relative clause.
   The structure of this chapter is based on a formal classification of relative
clauses. Apart from the three major types mentioned above, it also describes the
copular relative clause (19.4), the headless relative clause (19.5), and depictives
(19.6).","[710, 711]"
"
17.2.1.3. Existential constructionThe construction predicates the existence of a certain entity in general, in a
particular location, or in somebody's temporary possession. This entity
corresponds to the predicative element. It immediately precedes the copula,
however, it may also be postposed, as in (1234). The postposition of the
predicative element seems to be a recent development and can perhaps be
explained by the influence of Russian word order.",[653]
"
22.5.1.2 The ""reflexive"" strategyThis strategy is used in all types of clauses with active participles (7.6.1.1), as
well as in adverbial clauses with Imperfective Converbs (7.6.2.2) and
Purposive Converbs (7.6.2.1). The same morph marks the clause type in
clauses with the different-subject and the same-subject. It is obligatorily
followed by a switch-reference affix, which is either a usual agreement
Possessive suffix (4.1.4.1) for different-subject, or a Possessive Reflexive
suffix for same-subject: -i or -mi (variations are conditioned by the historical
stem type, see 4.1.4.2) for Singular and -f(e)i for Plural subject. The Singular
same-subject marker -i is employed in Present and Future Participles and in the
Imperfective Converb. The Singular same-subject marker -mi is employed in
Past Participles and Purposive Converbs. In same-subject relative clauses of a
certain type (19.1.1) the personal affix on the participle can be completely
absent.
   In (1632) we illustrate the switch-reference contrast for the adverbial clause
with an Imperfective Converb, and in (1633) and (1634) for the adverbial
purpose clause.

24.1.3. Verb finalityVerb finality is violated by the subject postposed under certain conditions
(24.1.2). In addition, it can be violated as a result of object postposing. When
an element other than the direct object corresponds to the focus function, the
direct object in the transitive clauses is likely to be postposed and stand after
the verb (1779). However, it may also be located before the focus element, so
variants such as (1780a) and (1780b) are both acceptable, while the latter is
likely to express a greater degree of contrast.","[880, 881]"

23.1.2. Yes-no questionsYes-no questions are not marked by any additional morphological means or
changes in word order compared to the corresponding declarative sentence.
They are differentiated from them only by intonational patterns: the last word is
marked by a higher and more prolonged intonational contour (3.6.4). The finite
verb normally occupies the clause-final position. Examples (1675) show
ordinary yes-no questions, and examples (1676) illustrate negative yes-no
questions.(1675) a.   Nua-ni        tue      eme-gi-ze?

10.1.7.General properties of the adverbial phrase10.1.7.1. Position and co-occurrence of adverbialsIn this section we address not only independent adverbs, but also noun phrases
with an adverbial function (15.4) and postpositional phrases (10.2.3). In
general, there is a certain freedom of adverbial positioning, as long as the main
requirement of Udihe word order, the preverbal position of the focus element
(24.1.1), is satisfied. Clausal adjuncts with a temporal or spatial meaning, as a
rule, occur sentence-initially (732), although they may follow the subject (733).
On the position of the adverbial subordinate clause see Chapter 21.

24.3.1. Intensifying the adjectiveIn adjectival copular constructions (17.2.2.1.1), the predicative adjective may
take the 3rd person personal marker -ni. This situation expresses a certain
semantic and perhaps information structure content, namely, the high degree of
the feature denoted by the adjective, cf. the attributive adjectives that use the
same device for the same purpose (24.2.1.1.1). Sentence (1816d) is an example
of the Resultative Participle in the predicative position. The affix -ni here
intensifies the meaning of the adjective.(1816) a.     Bi sita-i             ketu   pag'a-ni.

24.3.2. Topicalized subjectThe topicalized subject of copular constructions may be repeated twice within
the sentence: first, in the clause-initial position as the subject, second, as the
predicative element. The predicative word of the initial copular construction is
demoted to the modifier position. For example, the construction (1817b) with
the topicalized subject ΟΙοηο wo:-ni Olon mountain' is syntactically derived
from the regular copular construction (1817a). The predicative part gugda wo:
'high mountain' in (1817b) consists of the modifier gugda 'high' which
corresponds to the initial predicate and the ""doubled"" subject wo: 'mountain'.(1817) a.   ΟΙοηο       wo:-ni            gugda.

                            Adverbial clause
Most adverbial clauses in Udihe are non-finite: they can be infinitival,
participial, or converbial. The morphology of the Infinitive, the active
participles, and the con verbs is described in Chapter 7; other types of
participles are not used in the adverbial clause (for the one exception see
21.3.1.6). The semantic type of the infinitival and converbial adverbial clauses
is largely determined by the subordinate predicate itself, that is, by the
particular type of converbs or infinitive. The semantic type of the participial
clause is normally conditioned by the case- or postpositional marking on the
participle. In this chapter, the adverbial non-finite clauses are classified
according to their formal and semantic types.
   Typically the position of the adverbial clause in the sentence is either at the
beginning or at the end. It does not intrude between verbal arguments or
between an argument and the verb, with the exception of the infinitival manner
clause (21.1.1) when it consists of one word (the predicate). There is a strong
tendency to front the adverbial clause. However, a purpose clause is usually
postverbal.","[760, 761]"
"Since the head nominal within the clause is marked for case, its syntactic role is
indicated twice in the sentence. We only have examples of the Accusative and
Nominative noun phrases with postposed modifiers at our disposal. The head
noun controls the Plural marking on the postposed modifier, as in (1804b)
below. It is not entirely clear, however, whether we are here dealing with an
instance of attributive agreement, or whether the modifier is clause-external
and should be analyzed as substantivized.
   There seem to be two forms of modifier postposing. The first is motivated by
information structure considerations, namely, the afterthought status of the
postposed element. By ""afterthought"" we mean an element added after the
completion of the sentence to clarify an element of the clause, such as, for
example, sagdi bäsa-la 'a large river' in (1803a) or uti ninta-wa 'that man' in
(1803b).(1803) a.   Omo         bäsa    i:y-ki-ti,                sagdi      bäsa-la.

"   We can also hypothesize that the traces of «-final adjectival stems are
present in n-initial derivational affixes that exhibit alternation, such as, for
example, the affix -n'Ause ~ (')-use (6.4.1.4.1). Some other n-initial affixes (or
those beginning with η before the velar) do not exhibit variations of this type,
but the data from closely related languages demonstrates that initially the suffix
did not begin with the nasal. So after the unification of the class I and class Π
adjectival stems in Udihe the morpheme boundary must have moved. Cf., for
example, the Udihe suffixes -ndima (6.4.1.1.7) and -i]ku (5.1.1.4) and the
comparative data from related languages.(260) a.      Ulcha

6.1.2.1. NumberThe Singular is not morphologically marked, while the Plural may be expressed
with special morphological means (6.1.2.1.1). It can also be rendered by the
restrictive particle m'ei 'all, entirely, only, exclusively' (12.1.1.9.3) when it
immediately follows the adjective.

23.1.1. W7i-questionsIn w/i-questions the question word (a certain form of the Interrogative pronoun)
replaces the questioned constituent. Question words are listed in 9.5. Any
constituent of the main clause can be questioned in this way. The position of
the question word is strictly before the finite predicate, in accordance with the
more general rule on the preverbal position of the focus element (24.1.1). The
only exception is the question word i:mi 'why' (23.1.1.6). In questions to the
modifier the whole modified noun phrase must immediately precede the
predicate. The preverbal question word, like other focus elements (24.1.1), may
be sentence-initial (1647), however, other constituents (in particular the
subject) can precede it, as in (1648).(1647) a.   J'e-we        nixe-ini      si      sita-i?

never take Plural agreement.

                 Complement subordinate clause
This chapter deals only with non-finite complement clauses. Finite complement
clauses, and, in particular, direct and indirect speech constructions, are
addressed in Chapter 18. On subordinate questions see section 23.1.4.
   The complement subordinate clause in Udihe is a sentential argument with
the syntactic role of the subject (20.1) or the direct object (20.2). The predicate
of the non-finite complement clause is expressed by the Infinitive (7.6.3), a
participle (7.6.1) or, less frequently, by the Purposive Converb (7.6.2.1). The
particular strategy of forming the complement clause is mostly determined by
the matrix verb, therefore the verbs that require each particular type of
complement subordinate clause are given here in a representative list. The
chapter is organized according to the formal types of the complement
subordinate clauses which basically correspond to the valence patterns of the
matrix verbs.
   As in the other subordinate clauses (Chapters 19 and 21), the subject of the
complement subordinate clause may or may not be coreferential with the
superordinate clause subject. In the former case the subordinate clause
predicate is marked by same-subject switch-reference affixes, in the latter case
by different-subject affixes. The coreferential subject is often anaphorically
dropped, either from the superordinate clause or from the subordinate clause.
Some types of complement subordinate clauses allow only either same-subject
or different-subject. These are discussed in more detail.
   In the sentence, the subject complement clause (sentential subject) occupies
the linear position usually associated with the subject (see 24.1.2). The object
complement subordinate clause normally immediately precedes its head, the
matrix verb, but it can also be separated from the matrix verb by VP adverbs or
other elements. The postposing of the complement clause in the postverbal
position is allowed. The complement clause itself is head-final, although
younger speakers occasionally allow non-verb-final complement clauses,
apparently under the influence of the Russian word order (1.5.2.2.2). The
subject, if overtly present within a complement clause, tends to occupy the
leftmost position.
704 Complement subordinate clause20.1. Sentential subject20.1.1. Infinitival sentential subjectThe infinitival sentential subject is possible with one- or two-place predicates
of state that normally participate in copula constructions in the superordinate
clause (17.2.3.1). The copula predicates that take sentential subject
complements are the following:(1437)^:                          'bad'                   aja      'good'
      sebzeijke                   'interesting'           χei      'tasty'
      maqga                       'difficult'             tuge     'quick'
      eke                         'slow'                  go:      'long'
     gugda                        'high'                  zas'a    'easy'
     seuni:                       'dangerous, scary'      so.ndo   'sin'
     jaza                         ΌΚ'                     sei      'chilly'
     safani                       'tiring, boring'        egdi     'a lot'
     kiab'au                      'tight' (SK 1013)       ñamai    'warm'
     ba: anci                     'no place'
     lijjga-liijga bie            'sticky'
     tembu-tembu bie              'springy'The modal predicates that belong to this group are actually Past passive
participles or Necessitative passive participles of the verbs metu- 'finish,
accomplish' and mute- 'possible' in the affirmative and the negative form:(1438) a.   metu-se               'finished'
            e-u-se metu           'unfinished
       b.   mute-u-zeye           'possible'
            e-u-zege mute         'forbidden, not possible'Normally these predicates take the experiencer argument expressed by the
Dative noun phrase (17.2.3.1). The second argument (if present) may
correspond to the subordinate clause controlled by the Dative experiencer of
the superordinate clause (20.1.1.3). When the predicates listed in (1437) govern
the complement subordinate clause whose subject is not coreferential with the
Dative experiencer, the subordinate clause is finite. This case is treated in
18.3.1.5. Finally, the impersonal non-controlled infinitival subordinate clause
may function as the only argument (20.1.1.1).
                                                              Sentential subject 70520.1.1.1. Impersonal clausesThe impersonal sentential subjects are semantically close to finite agentless
clauses (16.2.5). However, as distinct from finite agentless constructions, it
seems that sentential subject clauses are mostly of generic character, and
cannot be interpreted as indefinite (in the sense of ""not known to the speaker"").
Both the simple Infinitive (1439) and the Impersonal Infinitive (1440) occur in
this type, but the latter is more typical of the Northern dialect.(1439) a.   Ei              terjku-le         te:-mi            ketu    nektes'e.

       b.   Ge:             cemne-mu.

            dangerous [alone               travel-IMI]
            'It is dangerous to travel alone.' (SK 848)Furthermore, it appears that the matrix predicate (an adjective) can express the
number of an object participant of the subordinate clause. We have only one
example at our disposal: in (1441) the adjectival Plural marker -yku indicates
the plurality of the subordinate clause object mo:-wo 'trees'. The subordinate
clause is shown in brackets.

"
7.9.1. ImperativeNull-argument verbs (14.1), desiderative verbs in -mu:i- (8.2.3.1), some modal
verbs and psych-verbs (such as ntte- 'to be going to do something', ca.la-
264   Verbal morphology 'want'), and some one-argument verbs that express natural phenomena (for
example, mude- 'come' (of water)) do not have the Imperative. In certain
copular constructions (constructions expressing destination, desire, quantity,
and experiential state, see Chapter 17) the verb 'be' cannot be used in the
Imperative either.
   The Imperative expresses the usual imperative nuances, such as order,
request, command, etc. The hortative particle -zA serves to soften the tone of
the request, as in (422c).(422) a.    Baulima-wa              diga
            corn-ACC                eat.IMP.2SG

"
24.2.1.2.1. Adjectival modifier in focusAccording to the general principle of Udihe word order (24.1), the focused
constituent occupies an immediately preverbal position. Modifiers, when they
bear a strong (contrastive) focus, may be located preverbally, while the head
noun marked for case is postposed. Such a construction is mostly typical of
different kinds of quantifiers and will be referred to as ""quantifier float""
(24.2.2.2.2), however, adjectival modifiers are also attested in focus position.
Examples (1798b) illustrates a discontinuous adverbial clause.(1798) a,   Seuni:       seuni: xulis'e       guy-ki-ni
            wful         awful come.PERF     say-PAST-3SG

            Zandalafu CONT-FOC
            'She said: the AWFUL Zandalafu came.' (K 105)
       b.   Caixi        e-zi           xuli  auija-digi.
            far          NEG-IMP.2SG go      night.shelter-ABL
            'Don't go FAR AWAY from the night shelter.' (SK 252)
24.2.1.2.2. Quantifier floatThe floated quantifier always has a morphologically bare Nominative form, as
distinct from the constructions where the postposed quantifier agrees in case
with the head nominal (13.3.6). The floated quantifier, therefore, behaves
morphologically as an unchangeable adverb rather than an adjective or other
determiner.
   The quantifiers that undergo floating are: the universal quantifiers teu and
käu (in the Northern dialect) 'all', the scalar quantifiers lä(si), egdi, and tä(si)
'many, much, a lot', and - less frequently - some quantitative nouns with
partitive meaning (13.3.3). Floated quantifiers do not inflect for case.
   The floated quantifier is located in the immediately preverbal position and
bears the focus function. Quantifier float is normally triggered by the subject,
as shown in (1799) or the direct object, as in (1800). It seems that grammatical
854 Information structure and word orderrelations other than the subject and the direct object cannot trigger quantifier
float. Typically the head noun immediately precedes the quantifier, but this is
not necessary so. It may be postposed after the verb (1801).(1799) a.   Mo:         abdä:-ni          teu      guline-kte:-ti.

24.2.1.2.3. Extraposed modifierThe modifier that is located discontinuously from its head at the right edge of
the clause is usually separated from the rest of the sentence by a pause, and
bears a rising intonation. Formally constructions with the extraposed modifier
are completely identical to the constructions with the non-adjacent relative
clause (19.3). The extraposed modifier normally takes the case marker that
indicates the syntactic role of the head nominal, but does not take a possessive
suffix. Cf. construction (1802a) with modifier raising and (1802b), where the
modifier is extraposed:(1802) a.   Bu-je                 min-du           j'eu-de

8.2.1.5. Passive8.2.1.5.1. DerivationThe passive derivation is marked by the suffix -u- (formally identical to the
unproductive Causative marker, 8.2.1.3.4). When the suffix -«- follows a
vowel-final verbal stem it forms a vowel cluster with the stem-final vowel
(522a). In the pronunciation of some speakers the vowel cluster tends to be
avoided, and is prevented by an epenthetic Iwl (522b), see 3.2.3. In other
idiolects the cluster contracts into a long /«:/, especially when speaking
quickly, as shown in (522c). For «-final verbs the Passive suffix induces the
alternation Ini  Imi (522d).       a.   ana-          'push'          ana-u-        'be pushed'

changes into -w- in the intervocalic position (see 3.2.3), as in (523a) The
non-intervocalic -u- is preserved (523b), while the long -«:- gets shortened
(523c). Thus in the Past, as in the Present, various free and idiolectal variations
occur.(523) a.    ana-u-o:-mi -> ana-w-o:-mi             Ί was pushed'

   In the linear order of derivational morphemes the Passive suffix belongs to
the positional group V, cf. zawa-gi-w-o:-ni                'was taken back'
<take-REP-PAS.PAST-3SG>. Yet, in at least two examples in our corpus it
precedes an aspectual marker, the Inchoative suffix (524a) and the Experiential
suffix (524b), which reflects the scope relationship between them.(524) a.    Ele           nada koto-du             diga-u-li-e-mi.

order in which the syntactic derivation takes place. In (525a) passivization
""precedes"" causativization, and in (525b) the relationship is the reverse.(525) a.    ña:ma-u-wan-                  'cause to be cursed'

17.2.2.2.1. Destinative nouns in predicative functionThe Destinative noun within the copular construction predicates the destination
of the subject for a particular potential recipient (benefactive) or for making
something (goal). So there is an apparent semantic difference between such
constructions and constructions with Destinative Participles (17.2.1.2 and
17.2.2.4), which indicate that an object is designed for a certain activity.
Destinative copular constructions are found only in the 3rd person. The
predicative element is a destinative possessive noun phrase that encodes the
benefactive/goal. The noun in the Destinative case takes the possessive
reflexive suffix -mi in the meaning of general destination when the potential
goal is not expressed within the destinative noun phrase (1273a). When the
benefactive is expressed as a possessive modifier, it is referred to by possessive
affixes on the head, see (1273b) and (1273c).(1273) a.   Ei ñaktu mo:            saymiyku-ne-mi.

            'You have now become grown up.' (K 164)   We have at least one example at our disposal in which grammatical relations
are reverse: the destinative noun seems to correspond to the subject of a
copular construction, while a Nominative noun has a predicative function. This
follows from the word order and semantics of the sentence. Unfortunately, no
other material is available.

17.2.2.2.2. Nouns in the oblique cases in predicative functionA noun in the local cases does not itself have a predicative function. What is
predicated by such a construction is the local relation of the noun phrase to the
subject. The noun within the predicative phrase takes the Dative/Locative or
the Ablative. In the Dative/Locative it denotes temporary location (1275) and,
if it is animate, it can also express a woman's marital relationship (1276).(1275) a.   Anna         zugdi-du         bi:-ni.

"
16.1.1. PassiveThe Passive is only allowed for transitive verbs. As was mentioned in 15.2.1.2,
mostly direct objects are passivized in Udihe, on possible exceptions see
15.1.1.3. Several passive verbs do not have a non-passive equivalent
(8.2.1.5.2).
   The meaning of the Passive in Udihe is actional. Compared to certain other
languages that have the Passive, the Udihe Passive is used rather rarely. Some
functions which cross-linguistically are typical of the Passive are fulfilled by
the Agentless Passive construction (16.1.2). The only use of the Personal
Passive is for the topic-promoting of the patient argument, although other
strategies are available for this as well (see Chapter 24). De-emphasizing the
agent, which is universally known to be another function of the Passive, is a
function of the Agentless Passive in Udihe (16.1.2).
   In the Passive construction the agent participant does not correspond to the
grammatical relation of the subject. The passive agent is marked by the Dative
and bears the grammatical relation of adjunct. It is normally overtly present;
however, removing it from the sentence does not yield ungrammaticality. A
certain split is observed in the grammatical encoding of the patient/theme
argument, depending on its deictic status.",[608]
"
23.2.1.2. Inchoative negative constructionInchoative situations in the Past can be negated in two ways, depending on the
scope of negation. If the negation takes scope over the whole proposition ('did
not start doing something'), this is expressed formally in a regular manner:
with the negative verb in the Past and the content verb bearing the inchoative
suffix -li- (8.2.2.1). When the inchoative operator remains outside the scope of
negation ('started not doing something', that is, 'stopped doing something'),
Udihe uses a special construction. It indicates that the action no longer takes
place. The construction contains (in this order) the Present form of the negative
verb e-i, the bare stem of the content verb, and the verb ede- 'become' in the
Past tense with the corresponding agreement affix. Cf. (1705a) and (1705b):(1705) a.   Ñ'aula       e-si-ni                 sotjo-li.

24.2.2. Information structure in destinative constructionsIn the regular possessive destinative noun phrases in the object role the head
noun (the destinative object) encodes the person and number of the possessive
modifier (the benefactive) by means of personal agreement affixes, see 13.1.","[893, 894]"

raising is available in the same contexts where a non-raising adjective-noun
construction is used. For example, in (1784a) a regular noun phrase (saijta
mamaka 'old woman') is coordinated with a moidifier-raising construction
(ni:nta saqta-ni 'old man'). The same is in (1784b).(1784) a.   Saijta         mamaka            ni.nta sarjta-ni         uli

             'If you are an old man, be my father, if you are an old woman, be
             my mother.' (SKX 224)   The raised modifier acquires the following head properties: (i) it is an
obligatory constituent of the clause; (ii) it bears morphological markers that
show the external syntactic relations of the noun phrase in the clause (case
markers); (iii) it is located in a typical head position, that is, phrase-finally; and
(iv) it is marked by the possessive affix in the same way as the head of the
possessive phrase (13.1), which suggests that the initial head nominal is
demoted to the position of possessor. The structure of the noun phrase with the
raised modifier is as follows:(1785) noun - modifier + the case marker + the 3rd person personal affix -ni   The following modifiers undergo raising: adjectives (24.2.2.1.1), certain
quantifiers (24.2.2.1.2), and the relative clause. The internal relative clause (the
""topicalizing"" relative clause) was discussed in 19.2. The information structure
requirement that conditions this type of relative clause is basically the one that
conditions the raising of other modifiers, namely, the topicalization of the head
noun. Most quantitative nouns with a partitive meaning (13.3.3.2), numerals,
possessive modifiers (13.1), modifiers expressed by a postpositional phrase
(13.5), or the oblique-case noun (13.6) do not undergo raising, although some
of them may be postnominal.
   When the raised modifier construction is in its turn the head of the
possessive phrase, the possessive affix -ni is replaced by the possessive affix
that refers to the possessor of the possessive phrase. In (1786b) the raised
quantificational noun (tie 'pair') bears the 2nd person personal marker, cf. the
regular construction (1786a).(1786) a.    si tie kolo-wo-i          'your pair of mittens'(ACC)
             <you pair mitten-ACC-2SG>
       b.    si kolo tie-we-i          'your pair of mittens' (ACC)
             <you mitten pair-ACC-2SG>
24.2.1.1.1. Adjectival modifier raisingIn (1787) we exemplify postnominal adjectival modifiers that bear the 3rd
person personal marker -ni and a case affix indicating the syntactic role of the
noun phrase. In these examples, adjectival modifiers bear new information (are
                                  Information structure within the noun phrase 849in focus), and the head noun is part of a pragmatic presupposition, i.e. (a part
of) the topic. In addition the raised adjectival modifier may express a high

850   Information structure and word order
24.2.1.1.2. Quantifier raisingScalar quantifiers egdi 'many, much', wac'a 'little, few', xa: 'some' are raised
under the same conditions as adjectives, and form the same construction, cf.:(1789) a.   Bu ni:      egdi-tigi-ni               yene-mu.
            we man      many-LAT-3GS               go-lPL.EX
            'We visit many people.'

            'There are many people today.'","[883, 884, 885, 886]"
"The possible formal patterns for expressing plurality of the head noun within
the adjectival phrase are as follows:(943) 'tall mountains' gugdawe:                             SG-SG
                       gugda-qku we:                        PL-SG
                       gugda-qku we:-ziga                   PL-PL
                       *gugda we:-ziga                      SG-PLThe nominal head, therefore, must control number agreement on the adjectival
modifier, although the head itself is not necessarily morphologically marked
for plural.
   Compound adjectives (6.4.4), pronominal adjectives, and some other
adjectives (6.1.2.1.1) do not take Plural affixes under any conditions. For such
a noun phrase plurality - if emphasized - may be expressed with the restrictive
particle m'ei (12.1.1.9.3). However, in at least two examples at our disposal, a
compound adjective bears the nominal Plural affix -ziga. Both cases involve
ideophones in the attributive position, which either precede or follow the head.(944) a.    xutam-ziga             buycau
            red-PL                ginseng

488     Noun phrase13.3. Quantified noun phraseThe following quantifiers are observed: quantificational nouns (13.3.3),
universal quantifiers (13.3.2), scalar quantifiers (13.3.4), and numerals (13.3.5).
The regular word order within the quantified noun phrase is(945)    quantifier — head noun (+ case affix)A preposed quantifier has the bare form; the syntactic relationship between it
and the head is not encoded morphologically. The universal quantifier teu 'all',
as well as certain scalar quantifiers and quantificational nouns allow modifier
raising (24.2.1.1). Most scalar and universal quantifiers participate in the
quantifier float construction (24.2.1.2.2). Some scalar quantifiers and numerals
may exhibit agreement in (the Accusative) case with the head (13.3.6).
Together with the Accusative case agreement between the relative clause and
its head (19.2.3), this is the only instance of attributive case agreement in
Udihe. The number of the head noun is addressed in 13.3.1.","[521, 522]"

592 Valence-changing operations16.1.5. ReciprocalReciprocal derivation is marked by the suffix -masi- attached to the verb
(8.2.1.1). The Reciprocal verb in Udihe always takes Plural agreement
inflections, although the subject need not have a Plural form.
   In the Reciprocal construction an action is performed by two or more
participants upon one another. The situation must have at least two animate
participants and be symmetrical in the sense that they are both involved in it in
the same way. Both transitive and intransitive verbs can reciprocalize provided
they are not subject to any semantic constraints. Both the second argument (the
direct object) and the third argument (the indirect or oblique object) can be
involved in the reciprocal relation. Reciprocal constructions fall into three
types: (i) reciprocalization of the direct object of two-argument transitive verbs;
(ii) reciprocalization of the indirect object of two-argument intransitive verbs;
and (iii) reciprocalization of the indirect object of three argument transitive
verbs. Reciprocalization of the first and the second argument (the direct object)
leads to detransitivization of the base verb. Morphological Reciprocals are not
used for reciprocalization of a possessor or adjuncts; reciprocalization of these
elements does not involve a change in the verbal form (see 22.4).
   The only possible syntactic antecedent to all types of reciprocalization is the
subject. Reciprocal structures without an overt antecedent occur only if the
subject is dropped under coreference. Across-clause reciprocalization is
impossible.","[627, 628]"
"There does not seem to be a neutral mutual order for temporal and spatial
adverbials. The spatial adverbial may precede (735a) or follow (735b) temporal
adverbial.(735) a.    Minti         zugdi-du-fi              tutulu asi    aja.

"
4.2.1.2. PluralPlurality is not obligatorily marked morphologically on nouns. Apart from
being encoded by the Plural suffixes, it may be expressed by other means such
as a quantifier (13.3), or by semantic agreement with the adjectival modifier
(13.2.2.) and/or with the predicate (15.1.1.2.2). The Plural of the object or the
subject can be marked with the Distributive derivational suffixes on the verb
(8.2.2.6). The mass and uncountable nouns including nouns co-occuring with
the collective word getu (4.1.2.2) are singularia tantum.",[149]
"
8.1.2.2. The suffix -li-The suffix -li- expresses the beginning of the state described by the adjective (cf.
the deverbal inchoative -li-, 8.2.2.1). Verbs in (502a) can take a subject; verbs in
(502b) are subjectless.             guaci           'bitter'          guaci-li-           'become bitter'

the deadjectival derivation, for example:       mayga                 'strong'          mai]ga-la-          'get exhausted'

298   Verbal derivation
8.2. Deverbal derivationDeverbal derivation of verbs typically involves a voice-related (8.2.1), an
aspectual (8.2.2), or sometimes a modal (8.2.3) meaning. Some of the suffixes of
deverbal derivation are very productive and attach to practically every verb.
However, such suffixation lacks semantic regularity; it often results in
unpredictable semantics, and therefore cannot be regarded as a grammaticalized
process.
   The deverbal affixes attach to a verbal stem in a particular order. With respect
to their position in the verbal form five groups of affixes can be distinguished.","[331, 332]"
"  When the scope relationship between two suffixes is irrelevant, both orders are
equally possible (555a). Thus, the Imperfective suffix -si- either precedes or
follows the Repetitive (555b).(555) a.     eme-kte-gi-      'come again/back (of several people)'
            <come-DIS-REP>
            eme-gi-kte-       'come again/back (of several people)'
            <come-REP-DIS>
       b.   uli-si-gi-        'sew many times again and again'
            <sew-IM-REP>
            mägda-gi-si-      'wake up again many times'
            <wake.up-REP-IM>
            tagdi-gi-si-      'pull out again many times'
            <pull.out-REP-IM>

suffix -sA-.",[353]
