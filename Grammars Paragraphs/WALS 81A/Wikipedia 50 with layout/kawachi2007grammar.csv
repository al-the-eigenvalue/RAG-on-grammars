5.2 Word Order5.2.1 SOV Word Order        When the arguments of a transitive verb are expressed with independent words(rather than being indicated only on the pronominal suffixes on the verb), the word orderis predominantly SOV. OSV order is possible, but is used only when the subject is infocus.11 For example, (5.56) and (5.57) are the same with respect to who loves whom,but (5.56) uses a word order that is neutral as to information structure, whereas (5.57)places focus on lat’o ‘[Lat’o (NOM.F)]’.
(5.56) lat’o                 danura                 bat-t’-anno.
       Lat’o(NOM.F)          Dangura(ACC)             like-3SG.F-IMPRF.3
       ‘Lat’o loves Dangura.’ (pitch accent: lat’o danura bat-t’-anno.)(5.57) danura                lat’o               bat-t’-anno.
       Dangura(ACC)            Lat’o(NOM.F)        like-3SG.F-IMPRF.3
       ‘Lat’o loves Dangura.’ (pitch accent: danura lat’o bat-t’-anno.)
       (It is no one but Lat’o who loves Dangura.)
5.2.2 Structure of Noun Phrases        In Sidaama, an adnominal constituent precedes the head noun that it modifies. Anattributive adjective comes before the head noun, as in (5.58).","[531, 532]"
"Hence, in both the benefactive construction with a transitive verb predicate in (5.195b)and the Dative EPC with a transitive verb predicate, the object of the transitive verb is apatient or theme, and a comparison is made below between them; the benefactiveconstruction with an intransitive verb predicate in (5.195a) is irrelevant here.(5.195) a.     Subj-NOM        dative entity-DAT                                     intrans.V         b.    Subj-NOM        dative entity-DAT       Obj(patient/theme) (ACC)        trans.V
As long as the verb is final, the order of the other constituents in the benefactiveconstruction is flexible. The order of subject NP–dative NP–object NP–verb in (5.193)can be changed to, for example, object NP–dative NP–subject NP–verb, as in (5.196), orsubject NP–object NP–dative NP–verb, as in (5.197).",[601]

Sidaama is spokenby over 1,800,000 people, but there has been relatively little research on the language.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"

2.3.4 Pause       Sidaama often uses pauses to indicate constituent boundaries. When the sentencehas SOV word order, a pause usually occurs between the constituent boundaries (Teferra2000: 16-17), as in (2.73). (In the examples in this section, pauses are indicated with //.)
(2.73) bule         //     danura                  //      sunk’-i-t-u.
       Bule(NOM.F) //       Dangura(ACC)              //      kiss-EP-3SG.F-S.PRF.3SG.F
       ‘Bule kissed Dangura.’In a sentence of OSV order such as (2.74), a long pause can generally occur after the firstconstituent.
(2.74) danura             //        bule                   sunk’-i-t-u.
       Dangura(ACC)         //        Bule(NOM.F)             kiss-EP-3SG.F-S.PRF.3SG.F
       ‘Bule kissed Dangura.’The constituent structure of a transcribed sentence can differ depending on the location ofa pause, especially because some case forms are morphologically identical (specifically,the nominative and the accusative of a feminine noun, the genitive and dative/locative ofan unmodified feminine common noun, and the genitive and nominative of a masculinenoun) and the person/number/gender of the subject can be indicated by the verb suffixalone, rather than the subject being expressed as independent nouns or pronouns. Forexample, each pair of sentences in (2.75) and (2.76), which look morphologicallyidentical, differ in the locations where pauses as well as high pitch accents are placed.","[95, 96]"

"Most of the properties of the EPC that were used in section 5.3.1.1 to show that thepossessor NP and the possessum NP are separate constituents apply to this constructionas well, though the pronominal object suffix that refers to an animate possessor cannot beused in this construction because it ends in the predicative noun-phrase clitic, rather thana verb. First, the two NPs are pronounced with different intonation contours. Second,another constituent can occur between them. For example, an adverb like t’a ‘now’ canbe inserted between the subject NP and the dative NP (e.g., ise t’a hakko manc-i-radarawo=te. ‘She is a friend of that man now.’). Third, the order of the possessor NP andthe possessum NP can be reversed, e.g., (5.254’) instead of (5.251) (repeated below as(5.254)).",[629]

                                   Chapter 5 Synt ax       This chapter examines Sidaama syntax. Section 5.1 discusses grammaticalrelations and section 5.2 word order. Sections 5.3 and 5.4 describe two families ofconstructions in this language, external possessor constructions (section 5.3) (Kawachi2006a, 2007b) and relative clause constructions (section 5.4).","[501, 502]"

Bybee looked into thepositions of verb inflections for aspect, tense, mood, and person (usually, person andnumber) in relation to the verb stem in a sample of 50 genetically and geographicallydiverse languages chosen by Perkins (1980), and found the following tendency: verbstem – aspect – tense – mood – person/number (in the case of suffixing languages).","[499, 500]"
"          The other type of dative construction, the judicantis construction (König andHaspelmath 1998; Haspelmath 1999), whose predicate is an intransitive verb or anadjective, expresses a state-change or a state in the judgment of the dative entity, which isusually animate. It takes the forms in (5.202), where the order of the subject NP and thedative NP can be reversed.(5.202)          a.

In (5.203), the patient/theme entity’s (‘Damboowa’) state-change or resultative state isdepicted in the dative entity’s (‘her’) judgment. Similarly, in (5.204), the patient/themeentity’s (‘his father’s’) state is described in the dative entity’s (‘she’) judgment. Inneither example is a possessive relation inferred between the dative entity and thepatient/theme entity.(5.203)          ise-ra                       damboow-i

As mentioned above, the order of constituents other than the verb in the judicantisconstruction is flexible, as in the benefactive construction. (5.203’) and (5.204’), whoseword order is different from (5.203) and (5.204), are grammatical.(5.203’)        damboow-i           ise-ra

          Thus, the benefactive construction with a transitive verb and the judicantisconstruction can each be identical in structure with the Dative EPC with a transitive verbpredicate or with an intransitive verb or adjective predicate, respectively, as shown in(5.205). As discussed above, the order of the constituents other than the predicate in the

"          As shown so far, words that refer to a person’s property or ability or a person withthat property or ability can be used as adjectives, as nouns, or like nouns. These can beclassified into three types depending on whether they exhibit more noun-like or adjective-like properties. The difference between the three types of words often emerges as adifference in their order when they modify the same noun in the same NP. Althoughmultiple adjectives only infrequently occur as modifiers of the same noun, if they do, thefollowing ordering rule roughly applies: a pure adjective in (3.130c), which cannot be

"Bybee examined the ordering relationship of each pair of inflections: (a) aspect – tense,(b) aspect – mood, (c) aspect – person, (d) tense – mood, (e) tense – person, and (f) mood– person. The relations relevant to Sidaama are (c) aspect – person and (f) mood –person, because this language lacks tense. Furthermore, aspect and mood markers do notco-occur. According to Bybee, aspect markers occur closer to the verb stem than personmarkers in 12 out of 21 languages that have both categories with only onecounterexample (Navaho). However, the aspect and person markers in Sidaama show theopposite order when the subject is the third-person singular or second-person plural,though Sidaama exhibits the predicted pattern when the subject is the first-person orsecond-person singular. Bybee also found that mood markers occur closer to the verbstem than person markers in 13 out of 26 languages that have both categories (with five42

information and the suffix that indicates the two categories is difficult to separate into distinct markers.",[500]
"         Admittedly, the use of a single consultant for a grammatical description cannottake into account idiolectal or dialectal differences. Nevertheless, even when multipleconsultants on a language are employed, it would be difficult to ask all of them exactlythe same set of questions to write a grammar of the language; a bias toward the judgmentof even a small number of linguistic forms by a certain speaker or speakers out of a groupof consultants would be inevitable. The consultation with a single speaker makes it easyto obtain consistent data. In order to benefit from this strength, I checked almost all theexamples in this dissertation with Abebayehu at least twice.",[47]

Also, as discussed in Chapter 3 (section 3.2.2.4), generally in Sidaama, an immediatelypre-predicate constituent is in focus. For example, (5.88) and (5.89), which both use theexistential/locational verb and consist of the same words with different arrangements, areusually interpeted differently as shown in their glosses; (5.88) places prominence on thelocation, whereas (5.89) on the located object.(5.88) aduricco     t’arap’ees-u woro              no.

       ‘There is a cat under the table.’
Because interrogative words concern unknown or new information, they tend to occureither in the predicate position or in the immediately pre-predicate position.       (5.90) and (5.91) are examples where the word for ‘who’ is a predicate.(5.90) kuni           beett-i                 ae=ho ?

       ‘Who is the one (F) who came here?’ (lit., ‘The one (F) who came here is who?’)
In (5.90) and (5.91), the interrogative word could be regarded as staying in situ, becauseit can be replaced by a non-interrogative NP in their declarative counterparts. Compare(5.90) and (5.91) with (5.90’) and (5.91’), respectively.(5.90’)         kuni           beett-i     danur-i=ho.

                ‘The one (F) who came here is Bushe.’
          When an interrogative word is not a predicate, the interrogative word or theinterrogative phrase is most likely to occur right before the predicate, regardless of itsgrammatical relation, though it can occur in any position. Examples are shown in (5.92)-(5.97). The interrogative word or the interrogative phrase is a subject (5.92), thepossessor of a subject in (5.93), a direct object in (5.94), the possessor of a direct objectin (5.95), an indirect object in (5.96), and an oblique in (5.97).14
14
  (5.92) is an example of the dative external possessor construction, and (5.97) is an example of the
oblique possessum external possessor construction (section 5.3; Kawachi 2006a, 2007b).","[545, 546, 547]"

  Different types of adjectives modifying the same noun in an NP occupy different positions in that NP.
For their ordering relations, see Chapter 3 (section 3.1.3.1).",[534]
"Therefore, the order of the adjectivizing suffix and the gender suffix cannot bedetermined. Also, those suffixes on adjectives that express gender can also indicatesingularity at the same time, and there are no cases where gender and number are markedseparately with two suffixes on an adjective. Thus, the internal order of the categories fornumber and gender in adjectival morphology is also indeterminate.",[476]

This construction would not be categorized as an EPC if the definition of an EPCexcluded any construction that lexically expresses possession by the use of a predicate ofnot only possession but location, because the possessive relation between the two entitiesis specified by means of the existential verb in (5.261), even though the possessor NP isoutside the possessum NP.

For example, an adverbial such as t’a ‘now’ can occur between thedative NP and the subject NP (e.g., damboow-i-ra t’a bun-u no. ‘Damboowa has coffeenow.’). Fourth, though the order of dative NP–subject NP is usually used, it cansometimes be inverted.       Fifth, the possessum noun may be accompanied by thepossessive pronominal suffix that refers to an animate possessor. However, thisconstruction conveys the availability of the possessum to the possessor in addition to thepossessive relationship, and its meaning is close to that of the IPC counterpart (discussedshortly).(5.262a’’)     damboow-i-ra
               Damboowa-GEN.PROP.M-DAT.PROP               min-i-si                   no(-si).

               (It is still available to him.)
Finally, like the Dative EPC with an intransitive verb, this construction uses the suffixform -u rather than -i for the nominative suffix on a subject noun ending in /a/ or /o/ thatis Unmodified by any adnominal constituent, as in (5.262); if the dative NP were adependent of the subject NP, a subject noun ending in /a/ or /o/ would take -i.","[633, 634, 635]"
"5.1 Grammatical Relations       Sidaama is a nominative-accusative language, which uses subject and object,rather than ergative and absolutive. The core grammatical relations relevant to Sidaamaare subject, direct object, and indirect object. For ditransitive verbs (u- ‘to give’, hir- ‘tobuy (for someone), sell’, kul- ‘to tell’, aris- ‘to lend’, leell-i-s- [appear-EP-CAUS] ‘toshow’), Sidaama makes a distinction between direct objects and indirect objects.",[502]

4.2.3.3 Order of Verb Suffixes          The verb suffixes also place the derivational suffixes before the inflectionalsuffixes. A derivational suffix may or may not occur, but at least one of the inflectionalsuffixes has to occur. When any of the derivational suffixes occur, one or more typesmay occur. When two or more types of derivational suffixes co-occur, they roughlyfollow the order in (4.299).","[476, 477]"

Nevertheless, there are a few exampleswhere gapping can be used to relativize an animate oblique argument. They are limitedto cases where the verb in the RC uses the reciprocal suffix (Chapter 4 section 4.2.1.3.4).",[663]

       The order of relative clause — other adnominal(s) — head noun does not alwayshave to be followed because the genitive noun can occur before the relative clause whenit is followed by the definite suffix and the noun-phrase clitic that agrees in case andgender with the head noun, as mentioned earlier for the ordering relationship ofadnominals. An example is shown in (5.77).(5.77) wosicc-u-nni=ti                     hiikk’-an-t-ino          lekka

5.2.3 Order of Other Types of Constituents• Standard — marker — adjective in a comparative       Sidaama shows the order standard-marker-quality (the order standard-marker-adjective/verb) in comparative constructions. An NP used for the standard of comparisonis usually followed by the ablative suffix -nni (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.1.3.6) to form acomparative adjunct, and the adjective or verb that expresses the quality occurs in theclause-final, predicate position. Examples are shown in (5.78) and (5.79). (5.78) shows                                         - 520 -

the comparative construction that is used most commonly when the predicate is anadjective or a state-change verb; the adverb roore ‘exceedingly’ or ale-nni ‘exceedingly’(lit., ‘aboveness-LOC’) (or simply ale) can occur optionally between the comparativeadjunct and the predicate for the quality. For an action verb predicate, the causative formof the verb roor- ‘to exceed’, rather than the adverb roore, which is used as a subordinateverb with the connective suffix, occurs between the comparative adjunct and thepredicate, as in (5.79).(5.78) bule        danur-i-nni                                 (roore/ale-nni/ale)

• Manner adverb — verb        Sidaama has only one lexical manner verb: sununni ‘slowly’ (Chapter 3 section3.1.4). It precedes the verb it modifies, as in (5.80), like all other types of adverbials                                             - 521 -

• Verb — tense/aspect auxiliary verb       There are two verbs that serve as aspect auxiliary verbs: the existential verb (lit.,‘to come to exist, come to be located’) (no for a third-person subject) and the verb for ‘tolive’ hee- (Chapter 4 section 4.2.2.3.1). The existential verb is always in one of itspresent perfect forms, and does not have any other aspect forms; it cannot occur with theinfinitive suffix or the connective suffix. It can follow a content verb to constitute thepresent-progressive form of the verb with the infinitive form of that verb followed by themanner/concomitance suffix -nni, as in (5.81), or the present continuous verb form withthe connective form of another verb, as in (5.82).(5.81) insa           ot-t’-a-nni                  no.

                          Kazuhiro Kawachi A Grammar of Sidaama (Sidamo) Chapter 5: Syntax 523Instead of the literal meaning of ‘to live’, hee- can express an action or state in the pastthat does not hold anymore at the time of utterance, as in (5.83) and (5.84). When usedthis way, hee- is always in the third-person singular simple perfect (hee’r-ø-i [live-3SG.M-S.PRF.3SG.M]), regardless of the person and number of the subject; it follows averb in the present perfect or in the imperfect, whose suffix has information on the personand number of the subject.(5.83) ani             bero           hudi’r-oo-mm-o

Thus, when used these ways, the two aspect auxiliary verbs both follow the main verbs.","[539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544]"

In (5.269) (repeated below as (5.272)), which uses the gappingstrategy (the gap is indicated with Ø), the relativized NP is the direct object of the verb inthe RC, and is not expressed in the RC; it would occur immediately before the verb of theRC if it were expressed in a sentence with the least marked word order.

           The issue of what types of constituents can be relativized was first taken up byKeenan and Comrie (1977, 1979, Comrie and Keenan 1979), who proposed the NounPhrase Accessibility Hierarchy shown in (5.274).(5.274)          subject > direct object > indirect object > major oblique case NP >
                 genitive (possessor) NP > object of comparison
They mean by “major oblique case NP” “NPs that express arguments of the mainpredicate, as the chest in John put the money in the chest rather than ones having a moreadverbial function like Chicago in John lives in Chicago or that day in John left on thatday” (Keenan and Comrie 1977: 66).","[641, 642, 643, 644]"

  When the subject NP whose head is =hu has a masculine singular referent, it can be the subject of the
relative clause that it heads, even when the sentence is identical in structure to the “RC=hu ...=ti”
construction. For example, (i) and (ii) appear to be used in the form of the “RC=hu ...=ti” construction, but
are not. The NP headed by the clitic =hu has a masculine singular referent, and has to be the subject or

  (5.50) would be grammatical if =hu were replaced by the feminine noun-phrase clitic =ti to form a
perfectly grammatical sentence, as in (i). However, the sentence is not an instance of the cleft construction;

          An instance of one of the Sidaama dative constructions is interpreted as aninstance of the Dative EPC when two conditions are met. First, the patient/theme entityusually has to be expressed with a common noun, preferrably one that is not modified bya dependent (or one that is Modified by an adjective, a numeral, or the possessivepronominal suffix that refers to the dative possessor, at most), unlike the dative entity,which can be expressed with any type of nominal. On the other hand, in the benefactiveand judicantis dative constructions, the patient/theme NP as well as the dative NP can beexpressed with any type of nominal. For example, in (5.193) (repeated as (5.210)),(5.203) (repeated as (5.211)), and (5.204) (repeated as (5.212)), the patient/theme entity

cannot be interpreted as a possessum of the dative entity because it is expressed with anNP whose head is modified by an adnominal demonstrative in (5.210), a proper noun in(5.211), and a noun possessed by a person who is not the dative entity in (5.212),respectively.(5.210)         ise       isi-ra                                hatte          hakk’icco

          A second condition concerns the subject’s belief or judgment. In order for aclause with the form of a dative construction to be interpreted as the Dative EPC, thespeaker has to believe that the dative entity is affected by the event either beneficially oradversely. Thus, the Dative EPC takes the speaker’s, rather than the subject’s or thedative entity’s, perspective.","[607, 608, 609]"

When a relative clause is formed by means of gapping, at least arguments can berelativized, whether the head of the relative clause is an NP headed by a common noun orthe noun-phrase clitic. However, non-arguments can also be relativized in certainconditions. The grammatical relations of relativizable NPs are discussed later in section5.4.",[518]

The first-person plural form is -n-a-mmo, inwhich the infinitive suffix is between the two components of the first-person plural suffix-n -mmo, which is a discontinuous morpheme. (This form could also be analyzed as asequence of the first-person plural suffix -n, the infinitive suffix -a, and the first-personsingular masculine suffix -mmo.)       Fourth, the suffix for the person/number of the subject occurs with the aspectualsuffix (following Teferra (2000: 80-81), the suffix complex that carries information aboutthe person/number of the subject and aspect is analyzed into components rather thanbeing treated as a portmanteau morpheme that simultaneously expresses the aboveinformation). As already shown in Table 4.6, they follow the same pattern as the suffixfor the person/number of the subject and the infinitive suffix when they occur before thedative suffix -ra. When the subject is the first-person or second-person singular, theaspect suffix immediately precedes the suffix for the person/number of the subject, whichis followed by the gender suffix (M: -o, F: -a). Thus, the order is -ASPECT-PERSON-GENDER. When the subject is the third-person singular or second-person plural, thesuffix for the person/number of the subject comes right before the infinitive suffix:-PERSON-ASPECT (-ø for 3SG.M is assumed to show contrast with -t for 3SG.F/3PL,which precedes any of the aspect suffixes). The first-person plural suffix is a disjunctivemorpheme made up of two components -n -mmo, between which the aspect suffix falls.","[497, 498]"

"        The present study does not distinguish the verbalizing suffix (that derive verbsfrom nouns) and the middle suffix because there is no clear evidence for the distinction.9(Also, in section 4.2.3.3, where the order of verb suffixes is discussed, the two suffixes,which occupy the same position relative to the verb root and other types of suffixes, areregarded as the same.)        Many of the noun-verb pairs in (4.16) can be used together in idiomaticexpressions like (4.17)-(4.22). Some of them (e.g., ‘dream’) require the noun to bemodified by an adjective.
