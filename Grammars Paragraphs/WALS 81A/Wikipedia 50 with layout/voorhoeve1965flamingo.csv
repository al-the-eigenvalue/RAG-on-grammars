The order of the suffixes is, as a rule : 1. suffix indicating the category;
2. suffix indicating the object ; 3, suffix indicating the subject.

the object, in farm 2.",[97]

As with the imperative forms, I did not find here a difference in
meaning between f o m s with and without a prefix, and between the

 characterized by the suffixes -en and -awuj, respectively, but that a 1x The following should be noted       regarding the arrangement of the paradigms :
          the verbal forms in the paradigms are shown without any prefixes. When
          prefixes do occur, they are given separately below the paradigms;
          in the forms, only the junction between the core and the peripheral part
          is shown: in the usual manner, by a dash. The morpheme structure of the
          peripheral part can be deduced by comparing the different forms and from
          the discussion on the formal characteristics of the categories which will
          be given immediately after the paradigms;
          when the phonological structure of the core influences the form of the
          suffixes following the core, the paradigms of the different verbs will be
          given in order to demonstrate this influence;
          in general, a translation will only be given of one of the series of forms.

similar suffix is absent in the form of the object category I. Object
category I is here characterized by the absence of an element of form
which is correlated with the categorical meaning. In a case such as this,
we can say that the object category is characterized by zero.
If we compare the form an-; with the other forms of the paradigm,
then we see that here the modal suffix c is absent: the imperative is
therefore characterized by zero. Besides an-i, the form with modal
suffix -c, a d c then occurs: here, the modal suffix -c alternates
with zero.","[90, 91, 92]"

"Sequences of formutives
I only found sequences of prefixed formatives preceding the first root
of a core, and sequences of suffixed formatives following the last root
of a core. Between two roots, sequences of two forrnatives do occur,
but the sequence consists always of a suffixed formative followed by
a prefixed formative. In these cases, the suffixed formative is always
-m/Vm; the prefixed formative is o/owz/at/oc- or, a (re)duplication:       R-ff-R        kd.m.o.ni to tear away and take downstream

   always placed before it, or always behind it;
3. they add to the core a specific semantic element ;

climate of the region is very humid and the rainfall abundant -
approximately 225 inches a year. The terrain is very heavy going on
foot, so the canoe is the usual means of transport. I t is used extensively.

is spoken). And one can do' the 'journey round the world' by setting
out from the Casuarinen Coast, crossing the stretch of water between
it and the Mimika Coast, landing there, and then returning to the
Casuarinen Coast. Through the middle of this world flows the great
River Sirkc, rising far away, somewhere at the top of the coconut,
close to the holy entrance to the upper world (the outside world).
From this opening, in prehistoric times, the heavenly beings descended
to earth, in order to populate the world with their descendants.","[14, 15]"

"The verbal core can be monomorphematic or polymqhematic. The
peripheral part consists of prefixes and/or suffixes added to the core.
   The mutual independence of the core and the peripheral part shows
itself in a difference in internal organization which makes a separate
description of the two parts necessary.
   Their mutual dependence shows itself in the fact that: a. a verb
consists either of a core, or of a core +   peripheral part, but never of
a peripheral part alone; and b. there are a number of verbal categories
that do not occur with cores ending with the morphemes iturn, es, it
or u w e ~(see 5s 91-94).

The morphological structure of the core
     Only provisional observations can be made here about the structure
of the core. The reason for this is that the main point of research, as
regards the verb, was an investigation into the verbal categories. An
insight into the structure of the verbal system proved to' be a pre-
requisite if I were to understand and to speak the Asmat language.
The relative independence of the core made it possible, temporarily
to leave its structure outside consideration. Since, however, research
into the verbal categories took most of the available time, there was
none left for a systematic examination of the cores. This remains one
of the most important tasks for future research.
  Consequently, the paragraphs on co-re-structure, as well as the para-
graphs on core-morphology, represent only a preliminary reconnaissance
in the field. The picture of the core-structure given here is for the
main part based on indirect information, i.e. information obtained from
an analysis of a specific corpus of verbal cores of which only a small
part was elicited from the informants with this analysis in view. This
corpus of verbal cores consists of 2 3,000 cores, of which Â±1.200
occur in the texts to be appended to this grammatical description.","[54, 55]"

7. The quotation marker in/un/n
258
in/un/n occurs in sentences containing a quotation in direct or in
indirect speech, or containing a statement made from hearsay.
It's noteworthy that the rule of distribution obtaining for in/un is
parallel to that which applies to the verbal forrnatives i t w n / u t h , it/ut
and to a number of verbal suffixes (see $ 91): un occurs after word-
final m (except after em, to stand), and after word-final p, w or f
preceded by a, o or 26, except after ap to sit. in occurs in the other cases.
n 46 was found only in two texts, narrated by a boy from Jepbni.

after form 6 of category 19:

division that also occurs in categories 10 to 24, inclusive. These object
categories are :I.    a. the verb has no object ;
      b. the object or, where the verb admits of two' objects, the indirect
      object, is neither the speaker, nor a group to which the speaker
      belongs, nor the person(s) spoken to :

    spoken to :

   Now that this book is finished the time has come for me tot express
my indebtedness to those who have made it possible. My first
acknowledgement is to the Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek
van de Tropen (WOTRO), formerly the Stichting Wetenschappelijk
Onderzoek Nieuw-Guinea (WONG), The Hague, for making available
to me the money to enable me to carry out fieldwork in linguistics
for a period of two years in West New Guinea and, in addition, for
making it possible for me to devote myself exclusively on my return
to working on the material I had assembled. I owe a particular debt
to the Treasurer of the Stichting, Dr J. H. Westerrnann for his
continued and stimulating interest in the progress of the work.
   I am grateful to the Board of Directors of the Koninklijk Instituut
voor Taal-, Land- en Volkenkunde, The Hague, for their kindness
in publishing this thesis as one of the Verhandelingen of the Instituut.
   My thanks are due to Dr J. C. Anceaux and Mr B. J. Hoff for
their suggestions made during the preparation of the book, suggestions
upon which I place great value.
  The translator, Miss Jeune Scott-KenAall, has been painstaking in
the difficult task of translating this work and her critical observations
have frequently led to a clearer formulation of the facts. Her efforts
deserve great praise.
   I t is not possible to name every person who was so1 helpful to my
wife and me during our stay in New Guinea and who made our sojourn
one of great pleasure, but they are remembered with gratitude.
   I will, however, mention those who were directly concerned with
my work. Foremost among them were Dr A. A. Gerbrands and
Mr D. B. Eyde who were carrying out anthropological fieldwork in
the Asmat country. Their friendship and their continued interest was
a stimulus to my own work and their knowledge of Asmat culture
enabled me to catch a glimpse of the inner working of this remarkable
society. Here the name of Pater G. Zegwaard, M.S.C. at Merauke
must not pass without comment. By placing his own field notes at the
disposal of the fieldworkers in the Asrnat country, he made accessible

"4 The m'/mV- category110
m- is prefixed to cores beginning with a vowel ;
mV- is prefixed to cores with initial consonant. The vowel of the
prefix is identical to the first vowel of the core, but it can also be a
irrespective of the following vowel. A definite regularity could not be
found here ; sometimes both possibilities were found alongside each
other, sometimes only one of them, for instance, I noted:
    from f o r 'to see' : xa6-por and md-for;
    from fis 'to come inside' : always mi-fis ;
    from ni 'to return home7: always md-n-i.
Cores with prefixed m-/mV- have a semantic element of intent which
is translatable with :1. to wish to, in order to, to intend to :

I asked them ""What's 'to goy"", they replied ""ma-jdr"". ""What's 'to
take' ?"" - ""mi-tew6r"".
The question is, how do these forms stand as regards the core which
can also indicate an action or a happening as such? It is out of the
question that this is an idiosyncracy of my informants, for Drabbe 9
had the same experience with his informants from Ajam.10 It occurs
to me that these forms only differ from the affixless core in having
a semantic element of explanation, or clarification. This idea is sup-
ported by the fact that in categories 12, 14, 16 and 17, forms also
occur that are characterized by a prefix m-/mV- which seems to differ   loan-word from Malay.
 8 mentioned in the introduction, $ 6.
lo Drabbe does not say this explicitly. That he had the same experience, how-
   ever, appears from his treatment of the m/mV-fwms: see 5 47 of his ""Gram-
   mar of the Asmat Language"".
76                             THE ASMAT LANGUAGE
from the forms without this prefix by having a semantic element of
explanation or clarification. Examples of the use of these forms., which
I shall call explanatory forms, are to be found in $8 140, 148, 158, 164.","[86, 87, 88]"

firing the canoes '. ""Tomorrow the drums must be beaten, your two
 fathers, your two elder brothers must depart on the day after to-
morro~w,""they said. In the morning, just when the sun had risen, they
took the baggage to the canoes. Pisim and Wasi, who sat in the house
[of their kinsmen], said: ""Hey, there, 'tomorrow the drums must be
beaten' so we said yesterday !"" ('Beat them yourselves, then,"" the
people said, and that morning they all started out, one after another.
On the Mani, ilt was the same: the people of Kajk, as though they had
been ordered, all went down the river, with paddles thumping. And
on the Mow, also, the people of Ewer, Surii, Majit-Jinic, Per and
Uwhs were also on the move as though they had been ordered; they
all rowed down the river with paddles thumping. They rowed out of
the Jom6t; the people from the Mani joined them, and they set out on
the Sirkc. The people from the Mow, one group after another, came
out and joined them. The water swarmed [with the canoes]. Some of
the people of Jep&m broke away and went- to the Asewkc; some from
Kajk broke away and went to1 the Asewec; some went to1 the Unir,
                                         c . went to Amorkp, to Ac,

way to Serkw. Nobody stayed behind.","[280, 281]"

aquatic, lying, sitting, standing, above eye level: these terms refer to
the five polsition-classes as discussed in 5 71, note. Aquatic and above
eye level are preferred here to swin1ning and flying. Thus e.g, 'aquatic

5 The Flamingo Bay dialect: area, history   The Flamingo Bay dialect is spoken by about 2,600 people who
live in five villages, Ewer, Surii, Jepkm, Per and Uwhs,9 situated in
the immediate vicinity of flamingo^ Bay. In the literature on Asniat,
this group of villages is also called BismAni, but the people themselves
apply this name only to the villages of Ewer and Surt?, of which the
inhabitants formerly lived together.
   The oral historical tradition of these villages goes back about a
century. About the middle of the 19th century, Ewer, Sure, Uwhs,
and the village of Majit, stood together on the River Mow: Uwus
is still there (see map). Jepkm and Per, situated on the Jom6t and
the M a d , respectively, were then on the upper reaches of these small
streams, with, at that time, the village of Kajk standing beside Per.
Later on, Majit affiliated with Surii, while Kajk ceased to exist,  According to the data furnished by the Medical Service for 1961, published
  in V. F. P. M. van Amelsvoort's thesis (see note 9, p. 192, the population of
  these villages at that time was :

because its inhabitants dispersed to different villages after the death
in battle of their foremost warrior.10 Some of the Kaj6 people went
to live at Surh. The inhabitants of Ewer and Suru left the Mow
and, after wandering about for some time, settled in their present
dwelling place.
   The language of the villages around Flamingo Bay exhibit small
lexical variations as between one village and another. Within Suru,
the descendants of the people from Kaje are distinguished from the
'true' people of Surh by some lexical peculiarities in their speech.
These singularities are regarded by the non-Kajk people as typical
of the latter. Nothing comparable concerning the people from Majit
came to my attention.116 Work with informants  The collaboration of two boys from Suru who were in the third
and highest class at the Roman Catholic Mission school, was arranged
with the help of the Mission. These boys were about 13 years old
and appeared to be fairly intelligent. One of them, Mifekpic, was the
principal informant throughout the entire investigation. The other,
Natinak, worked with me for over a year.
   Mifekpic, baptised Andreas, was a grandson of Warskkomen, the
oldest of the chiefs of Sur6 and the most influential man in the
Flamingo Bay area. Through his grandfather, Mifekpic was descended
from the people of Kajk. Natinak, baptised Natalis, was related on
his mother's side to the people of Amor&p, a village belonging to the
Aj5-m dialect-area. Both boys also had relatives in the village of Jepkm,    I was told in JepCm that, on the death of the most important fe.w~xiji$ic,
   warrior, it was formerly the usual practice for the group to break up, and
   for the people in it to seek affiliation with other groups ('villages').
11 Asmat villages are not closed communities as far as language is concerned.
   Formerly, there was a regular influx of people speaking other dialects con-
   sequent upon the practice of abducting women and children during headhunting
   raids; by the adoption of children at the peace ceremony; and by people
   affiliating with other villages (see note 9). At the present time, it is especially
   the family connections with other villages (probably as a result of the historical
   facts above mentioned) which provide the contact with people speaking different
   dialects. In Jepkn~,I know of family connections with four villages in another
   dialect-area, namely, Ac, Amiinamkaj, Miwar and Om&nesep.
   Although the Asmat people who speak one dialect regard anyone speaking
   another dialect as fasi (crooked, wrong), no similar judgement regarding the
   small language differences within the village community ever has come to
   my attention.
                                INTRODUCTION                          7where the investigation was later to be carried on. Mifekpic had even
spent part of his childhood there.
   My relationship to the two boys developed from the outset on the
'anak piara' 12 pattern: they called me their 'father' and were regarded
as my 'children'. They were paid in cash for their assistance. They
were given a meal every day, and now and then some clothes and
tobacco. With their wages they could buy clothes, tobacco, and the
highly prized axes and chopping knives at the shop in Agats. The
relationship with these informants was a very good and personal one
throughout the whole undertaking. They worked with enthusiasm and
pleasure, apart from some unavoidable lapses.
   Because the boys were still rather young, their knowledge of their
mother tongue, of tradition and of mythology was sometimes inadequate
for the translating of the folk tales I collected. The help of an older
man was then enlisted for the interpretation of mythological matters
and special usage. In addition, all the Asinat people with whom I con-
versed acted as informants. The information received from them was
always checked again with the regular informants.
   The reason I chose two of the latter was primarily to enable me to
control the information given by the one by that provided by the other
and vice versa. Another reason was that the boys' capacity for work
was rather small, especially in the beginning - an hour at a stretch
was more than enough for them. Later, when they had been properly
trained, they could sustain a session of two hours or longer without
difficulty. No fixed scheme of questioning was followed at these
sessions. The discussion began on a particular subject and developed
as it went along, depending upon the mood of the informant. The boys
were never prevented from giving information spontaneously, even if
it were not relevant, but sometimes they had to be guided along a fresh
track back to the original subiect. If it became apparent that an answer
to a question about a particular matter was not forthcoming readily,
either because the boy did not understand me, or because he had had
enough, then it was put on one side. Later, a casual return to it often
produced good results. If one of them gave information on a subject
and it differed from that which the other had furnished, then these
variations were discussed in the presence of both of them. And some-
times it then became clear that they held differing opinions regarding
the pronunciation of particular wolrds, or their meaning.","[17, 18, 19]"

I dreamt about ghosts, and it happened just that way. What I dreamt
actually happened. I, I disappeared in the forest; we went upriver with
one canoe to hunt and to1 get edible tops of the sago palm. We went
upriver to get the edible tops; to' get the edible tops we went upriver.
My peoplea stood there near the water's edge, but I stood alone at
the edge of the forest. I stood alone at the edge of the forest. The
daughter of Jornbtakap, his daughter was also there ; already she had
breasts. She had breasts; she stood there. In the evening they had
given her in marriage, but the girl had said: ""No, I don't want such
a marriage ! I want to look around and see if there's not a human man
who can be my husband, wait a bit !"" I was there getting the edible
tops. As for her great father, he sat there sharpening long arrows. She
went outside, slipping out behind his back. When she'd gone outside
behind his back, she said: ""Father, I want to go and see if there's not
a husband for me; I want to go and look for such a man."" And
straightaway she went off from the upper reaches. She passed one
sago1 garden after another on her way here; she passed one after an-
other.. . Now, I went to the Towmi, - the Towmi, I say.. . the
Siwinmak, the Siwinmak. I got an edible top and, - there stood a

"4 Present research, choice of dialect   The following description of the language is the result of an inves-
tigation into the coastal dialect around Flamingo Bay which was
carried out from November, 1960, to September, 1962, under the
auspices of the Stichting Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek Nieuw-Guinea
(W.O.N.G.).s
   The aim of this research was the collecting of material for a descrip-
tion of one of the Asmat dialects. Outside Mission circles in New
Guinea, almost nothing was known about Asmat. Drabbe's grammar
of the Ajkm dialect had been published, though this fact was not
known to me until I arrived in the area, and found that the Mission
disposed over a few copies of it. The only thing on Asmat I had had
at my disposal was a short vocabulary at the end of Drabbe's KAmoro
grammar. Thus a preliminary orientation into the language was not
possible. The investigation had to be started from scratch,
   For some time the Roman Catholic Mission had been opening
schools in the Asmat region, the language taught in them being Malay,  Primitive Society, thesis, Van Gorcum & Co., Assen, 1964. This thesis also
  contains a complete bibliography of works containing information on Asmat,
  up to 31th December, 1962.

the thing to do in this situation was to use Malay as the contact
language and to make use of bilingual informants - Asrnat Papuans
who had acquired a reasonable knowledge of Malay in school.
   On arrival in the area, it became clear that the number of Asrnat
Papuans with such a knowledge of Malay was meagre. These potential
informants belonged almost entirely to the younger generation -
children who had attended the three-year lower school of the Mission
at the Government Station at Agats, or who had left it. Only a few
of the ollder men knew some Malay. The children who went to school
in Agats came from the neighbouring village of Sur~?,and from Ajkrn.
The language of the village of Ajirn, already examined by Drabbe,
belonged to a dialect different from that of the coastal villages, one
of which was Surh, in the environs of Agats, and I therefore decided
to make the dialect spoken at Surh the object of the investigation.","[16, 17]"

1 The Asmat language: area, adjacent languages, dialects   The language of the Asmat Papuans, Asmat,l is one of a number
of related Papuan languages which are spoken over an extensive area
of the coastal plain of South-West New Guinea (Irian Barat). These
languages extend along the coast from the River Opa in the nolrth-west
to the mouth of the River Digul in the south-east.2
   The Asmat region is generally considered to be the coastal strip
and the adjacent hinterland between the Rivers Momkc (Le Cocq
d'Armandville) and Ewtii. In addition to his region, however, Asmat
is also spoken in a small area to the east of the confluence of the Rivers
Sirkc (Eilanden) and Wildeman; on the coastal strip between the
Ewtk and Cook Bay (the Casuarinen Coast) ; and in a few villages
on the coast between Cook Bay and the mouth of the River Digul.
   I t is still not known with certainty how far inland the Asmat
language-area extends. I t was only recently that this coastal area was
brought under Government control and that part of the low-lying
plain abutting onto the mountainous country in the centre is still
practically terra incognita. Up to now, Asmat villages have been
encountered inland to a distance of more than 70 miles.
   To the north-west of the Asmat language-area, two languages relatedIntroductory note

                           THE ASMAT LANGUAGE
to Asmat, KAn~oroand Skmpan, are spoken. These two languages
cover the whole coastal area between the Rivers Opa and Otakwa.
Between the Otakwa and the MomAc, where the Asmat language-area
begins, there are no villages. Nothing is known about the languages
to the north and the north-east of the Asmat language-area : in the east
and the south-east, Asmat meets up with the Awju and Jakaj languages,
which are probably not related to Asmat.3
   Asmat has various dialects, but a systematic investigation into them
has not yet been made, so that little is known about the nature and
extent of the dialectical variations. Broadly, Asmat dialects can be
divided into a central group of little differing dialects with, around it,
on the periphery of the Asmat language-area, a number of dialects
differing sharply from it: those spoken upstream of the Rivers Pomiic
(Noordwest), Unir (Lorentz) and Sirkc, and the dialect of the
Casuarinen Coast.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"8 Research in Ag-ats and Jepem  I began the investigation at Agats, but since Agats was completely
outside the sphere of Asmat society - it was a 15-minute walk from
Surh - I decided, once I had surmounted the first difficulties of the
language, to continue it in one of the Asmat villages in the vicinity
of Agate. By living amidst the Asmat people I would be able quietly
to observe the way in which Asmat society functioned and would
become acquainted with the people and their language. Surfi was less
suitable as a place in which to stay because the presence of the Govern-
ment and the Missions had to a certain extent already influenced the
way of life there. The village of Jepkm, where both my informants
had relatives, appeared to be the most suitable, and from May, 1961,
the investigation was carried on from there, interrupted from time
to time by a short sojourn in Agats.
   During the period of my stay in the Asmat region, the Dutch scholar,
Dr. A. A. Gerbrands, and the American student D. B. Eyde, were
also there: the former doing research into Asrnat art, similarly under
the auspices of W.O.N.G., and the latter doing ethnological field work.
Their presence was of great value in acquiring as good an insight as
                             INTRODUCTION                             9possible into Asmat culture. Many were the pleasurable and stimulating
discussions we had when we were together, either in the house of
the W.O.N.G. in Agats or at the 'Wong Club', as Dr. Gerbrands'
house in the village of Amhamkaj was called. During the last year,
a lively correspondence on mythological and linguistic subjects was
kept up with Eyde. A knowledge of mythology seemed to be of the
greatest importance for acquiring an insight into Asmat culture, and
it was for this reason that I put as many tales as possible on the tape.
I collected approximately 80 texts, but these represent only a fraction
of the wealth of stories the Asmat people know.

                             PHONOLOGY
I THE PHONOLOGICAL SYSTEMIntroduction
   The phonological description is based on the speech of the two
principal informants. In the cases where their speech deviates from
that of other people speaking the same dialect, the difference will be
mentioned.
   The system used for the phonetic spelling is that followed by the
American linguist, K, L. Pike, in his work ""Phonemics"".~ The
phonetic transcription, in accordance with usual practice, is put between
square brackets; the phonematic transcription between solidi. In the
phonetic spelling, the accent is indicated by a sign placed before
the accented vowel Fa] : in the phonematic spelling, by a sign above
the accented vowel /a/, The following signs are also used : # = other
than; Q = alternating with; C = consonant; V = vowel.
  The term duster means a biarticulate, non-geminate intervocalic
consonant cluster. The terms initial, media! and final indicate positions
in the word.","[20, 21, 22]"
"1 The Asmat people divide all existing things into these five 'position'     classes.
     In general, it can be said that anything that is tall and slender 'stands' (e.g.
     trees, upright poles, and men) ; anything that is about as high as it is broad
     'sits' (e.g. houses, carrying bags, and also women) : anything that is much
     broader than it is high, or is low to the ground, 'lies' (fallen trees, small
     animals, reptiles, the just-risen sun or moon). The fourth class contains
     anything in or on the water (e.g. canoes, fishes, and also rivers) ; the fifth
     class contains anything that is above eye-level (e.g. flying animals, hanging
     objects, objects stored away on the rafters of the house).

Now, Atiripic had cut down a sago palm. ""Presently, you must chop
down a sago palm near the path through [my] sago garden. You musk
scrape out the sago at night, and the sago, the balls of sago, you must
roast; roast them tonight. Then put them into a big bag and take them
with you. When you've fetched the maj of sago, put them in bag's. A
big fire, as for burning lime, you must light tonight,"" so he was ordered
by the man who had brought him to his house. And he put a large
piece of burning wood into an empty bamboo water container. That
night, they felled the big, full grown sago palm which stood there, the
one he'd pointed out to him. The people whom Atiripic had brought
upriver scraped out sago all night long. And also Taweric - Atiripic
had already gone upriver at night - fled, as though someone had
indeed ordered him to, upriver. Just as all the women went on their
way [after they'd washed the sago], there Taweric and his brother Jiw
dashed out of the forest. - ""Where's Atsripic? H e didn't leave the

"12 The habitual category13s
This category, like categories 13 to 15, inclusive, and 18 to 21, inclusive,
is a tense-aspect category with separate characteristics of form for
indicating time and aspect. In this category, as in the two previous
categories, a series of formal and a series of informal forms occur.
These two series are, in addition, opposed to a third series of forms
which express a particular mood of the speaker, such as, for example :
joy, excitement, vexation, disappointment. These forms I shall call
mood forms. The formal and the informal forms are, in this respect,
neutral. I n addition, a few interrogative forms were noted. These occur
only in the traditional stories. I get the impression that they have an
archaic character. Outside the traditional tales, I found in questions only
the non-interrogative forms, followed by the question marker en/an.17136
(Paradigms: see pp. 94-95)
I noted the following interrogative forms :
     1. t e t h - c e m a m   shall I give him
       3. t e t h - c W n &            will you give him
       6. tetam-cemdn                  will he give him

-cu before the mood suffix -p when -p is followed by u.
2. only with cores ending in the formative a w h : -m.18
3. Informal : - e m . This suffix occurs only with cores not ending in r.
The opposition formal - informal does not, therefore, occur if the core
ends in r.
Tense suffix: from a comparison with the forms of category 13, it
appears that here the time suffix is zero.
Mood suffix : -p/-op.
-p occurs in all forms, except when the object suffix and the subject
suffix are zero'; in that case, -@ occurs.
Interrogative suffix : -an.
Object suffixes ; peculiarities :
Ill, In the non-mood series : -&aw occurs before vowels ; -amw
occurs word-finally and before consonants.
Subject suffixes ; peculiarities :
1st. pers. s.; after the mood suffix - p : final    -w,
                                                 medial -u.
3rd. pers. s. ; in the formal and informal series: when the object
suffix is zero: -or alternating with -a. -ur and -a alternate freely,
except when, in context, the form is followed by a word with initial
vowel. In that case, this suffix is always -are

I l l THE ACCENTIntroduction39
  To the most recent investigations in the field of accent belong the
studies of the American linguist D. L. Bolinger. In 1958, the results
of a number of experiments he had made were published.8 These
showed that the most important cue in determining stress in English
is what he terms 'prominence of pitch', i.e. ""a rapid and relatively  I owe this term to: K L. Pike, Phonetics, University of Michigan, Ann
  Arbor, 1958, p. 93.

wide departure from a smooth or undulating contour"".g By 'departure'
Bolinger means a deviation in a contour which then continues in the
                                                                      - or
same pitch - ' -           or - -, as well as a sudden rise -
fall - , after which it continues on a higher or a lower level.
   w i t h r e g a r d to Asrnat, it could be established that in most cases
the accent is accompanied by a clear and sudden rise or fall of the
pitch. Four cases can be distinguished :1. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the rest of the contour:2. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the contour preceding it :3. The accented vowel has a lower tone than the contour preceding it:
                                       -
                                           --
4. The accented vowel has a higher tone than the contour following it:
     It is clear that in 3, and 4 'pitch' alone does not determine the
accent. There must be other factors that cause the difference. Bolinger,
who describes a parallel case in English, attributes the determination
of accent in this case to different factors: context, phonetic reduction,
and contiguous 'unaccentables3.10 It is not possible, however, for me
to determine in how far similar factors are also active in Asmat This
would require special investigation.
  There are also cases in which I noted accent without being able
to discern a deviation in the pitch by ear. In some of these cases it
could be established that the accented vowel was rather longer than
the contiguous non-accented vowels. It was often not possible, however,
to determine by ear what the accent-determining factors were.3-1 9   Id. p. 112.

1-1 I n the  above mentioned article, Bolinger remarks that psychological factors
     play a role in the interpretation of phonetic data as accent: data interpretable
     as accent may be ignored by a person speaking his mother tongue, when they
     occur in places where he knows from experience that there is no accent.

The general principle of accentuation
40
   The general principle of accentuation is : there is a reqular alternation
of accented and unaccented vowels.
   I n certain cases, however, sequences of two, at most three, un-
accented vowels occur.
   Furthermore, there are some cases of multi-vowelled onomatopoeia
in which no alternation of accented and unaccented vowels is found:
     iriririri   imitating"" the sound produced by many small objects
                 falling down.
     M s E       imitating the hissing of fire as it is put out.12
   The factors which co-operate to produce the accent pattern of a
word are : the morphological structure of the word, and the accents
of contiguous words in the context.","[35, 36, 37]"
