"2.     Language Oassification and Type.
       Unlike its neighbour Kala Lagaw Ya, which is classified as an Australian
Paman language, Meryam Mir is classified by Wurm (Ibid) as a Papuan language
of the Trans-Fly stock with a close genetic relationship to the languages of the
Eastern Trans-Fly Family, Bine, Gidra and Gizra.
       Its phonology is relatively simple, comprising a three way distinction in
point of articulation for oral voiced and voiceless stops (bilabial, alveolar and
velar) and a two way distinction in point of articulation for nasal stops and glides                                                                                 1
(bilabial and alveolar). The remaining consonants, a voiced and voiceless
fricative, a lateral and a rhotic tap, are all produced at the alveolar point of
articulation. The language has a five vowel system contrasting front and back
vowels /i, e/ and /u, o/ with a low central vowel /a/. The pitch-accent is
phonemically significant in the language, serving to distinguish certain lexical
items. Every word bears a high pitch on either the first or second syllable with
the majority of words carrying high pitch on the second syllable. The phonology
is covered in Chapter 1.
       The following word classes can be distinguished: nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, verbs, adverbs, deictics and interjections. Nouns and pronouns are
inflected for syntactic and non-syntactic cases. The cases are: ergative,
nominative, accusative, instrumental, allative (which includes some of the
functions of dative in other languages), ablative, locative, associative (which
could be labelled alternatively 'comitative') and genitive. There is a split case
marking system with an ergative case pattern on nouns for subjects of transitive
verbs and a nominative case pattern on pronouns for subjects of transitive or
intransitive verbs. Within the noun category, a distinction can be drawn between
common and proper nouns. With proper nouns, there is a three way split in the
case marking system with distinct inflections for the subject of a transitive verb,
the object of a transitive verb and the subject of an intransitive verb. Adjectives
as well as possessors marked by the genitive immediately precede the noun
which they modify and are thus syntactically dependent on the noun which is the
head.
        Pronouns distinguish between first, second and third person with a further
distinction contrasting inclusion and exclusion for first person nonsingular. In
addition, there are distinct forms for the singular versus non-singular. There is
no gender distinction with third person. Word classes and nominals are covered
in Chapter 2.
        Verbs can be categorised into two classes: atelic stative and telic active.
These classes are morphologically determined since the atelic stative verbs only
include intransitive verbs which mark the subject by means of a prefix, whereas
 the telic active verbs mark either the transitive or intransitive subject
 predominantly by means of a suffix. The two verb classes are partially
 semantically motivated as suggested by the names atelic stative and telic active.
 Verbal cross-reference markers encode information about both number,
 distinguishing singular, dual, paucal and plural, and to some degree, person.
        Time is divided up along the lines of present versus non-present where
 present refers to events that occurred any time on the same day as the utterance
 and non-present for events that occurred on another day or will occur following
 the utterance. There are also aspectual features such as the imperfective and the
 perfective. In addition, there is a mood marker, the irrealis non-committal,                                                                            2
which conveys the lack of commitment on behalf of the speaker to say whether
something will happen or not. Temporal, aspectual and mood categories, cross-
reference markers and other features of the verbal morphology are covered in
Chapter 3. Included in this chapter is a brief survey of adverbs, their formation
and function.
       There is a rich and complex system of deixis in the language which is
explored in Chapter 4. Deictic markers' forms are determined by the temporal
occurrence of the event relative to the time of the utterance. Their function is to
essentially focus on various elements in space, time and in discourse itself.
       Existential/locational verbs, intransitive, transitive and di-transitive verbs
form the basis of simple clauses. However, there are many events or states which
are expressed by complex verbal phrases consisting of a noun and verb with
nominals forming an essential part of the verbal's meaning. In such instances,
the whole verb phrase must be regarded as a complex head. There are no valency
changing operations except for an intransitiviser morpheme. A verb's valency is
more or less fixed with some non-productive morphemes affecting the verb's
transitivity and with periphrastic constructions for expressing inchoative and
causative meanings. Basic sentence types, verbal and nominal phrases as well as
some complex sentences are briefly examined in Chapter 5.
       The following study is a sketch grammar of Meryam Mir with special
attention to verbal morphology and the system of deixis.","[12, 13, 14]"

                             CHAPTER FIVE                             BASIC SYNTAX5.1   Introduction.
      Before examining clause types, it is worth briefly mentioning that word
order tends to be A-0-V or S-V with local arguments either following or
preceding the nucleus. Variations on this order are presumably the result of
pragmatics although this awaits a detailed study. Roles and functions of
arguments are morphologically marked through case suffixes with syntactic cases
only being cross-referenced on the verb.","[193, 194]"
"      Meryam Mir is a Papuan language spoken in the Torres Strait, that stretch
of water which lies between Australia and Papua New Guinea. It has an A-0-V
or S-V word order and an agglutinating morphology. Case inflections are
suffixed to nominals to mark their syntactic role in the clause. Markers cross-
referencing the syntactic arguments of the clause are affixed to the verb indicating
number and, to some degree, person. In typological terms, the language can be
regarded as a double-marking language.
      The following study is a sketch grammar of the language. Chapter 1 deals
with the phonology. Chapter 2 examines briefly the different word classes and
nominal morphology. Chapter 3 looks at verbals and their morphology. In
Chapter 4, the system of deictic markers is presented outlining some of its
functions and meanings. In Chapter 5, basic features of the syntax are outlined.

Acknowledgements.
       There are many people who must be thanked for their help. First and
foremost is the Murray Island Council who permitted me to come and live on
their island. All the people on Murray made me feel so welcome and I found
many new friends. I really need to thank everyone, from all the villages, from
Webok to Babud. Each and everyone contributed in one way or another and
taught me so much with diligence, patience and humour. The teaching sessions
often did not happen in formal sessions but when I was going for walks, at the
shops, having cups of tea, camping or picnicing at Dawar, spending time in
people's homes. To all those people, thank-you. To Les Saleee, his wife,
Maryann (Kosir), and their children, Galiga and Kinor, whom I lived with for all
those months and who became my dear family, thank-you. To all my other
relatives at Dew, thank-you. A special thanks to Tapim Binifather, Gamalai Passi
and Kathleen Salee who gave up their time to answer all my nit-picking queries,
helped me decipher texts and taught me more about their language. I would also
like to thank all those that allowed me to record stories: Henry Kaberi, Gracie
Barsa, Kaba Noah and his wife, James Rice, Eidiana Tabo, Meb Salee, Sam Passi
and many others. To each and everyone of you, 'big eso'.

        I would also like to thank my supervisors, Professor Dixon and Dr. Koch,
for all their helpful comments. My gratitude to all my friends, the 'Four
Muskateers', Felix 'Mangro' Ameka, Andy 'Slippery' Butcher, Ian 'Perv' Green
 and Nick 'Tufty' Reid as well as Yoshiko Sheard and my dearest friend Fran~oise
Dussart for all their support and assistance. There are too many to thank
individually but each one helped and encouraged me. Finally, to my family, all
my thanks and to Dotty, for making this last year very special.

                                  INTRODUCTION1.     The Language and its Speakers.
       Meryam Mir is one of three languages spoken in the Torres Strait, that
stretch of water which lies between Australia and Papua New Guinea (see Kmao lh.
                                                                       !Ca.klw a.Wo.w d J
on p. iv). The other two languages are Kala Lagaw Ya (also known ast\1(alaw
Lagaw Langgus, Mabuiag or Yagar Yagar, see Kennedy 1985 and Ford and Ober
1987; 1), which is spoken on the Western islands, and Torres Strait Creole (also
known as Broken, Pizin, Big Thap, Blaikman or Ailan Tok, see Shnukal, 1988; 3)
which is the lingua franca of the region. Meryam Mir was spoken throughout
the Eastern islands of Erub (Darnley Island), Ugar.(Stephen Island) and Mer
(Murray Island). However, with the ever-increasing use of Creole, Meryam Mir
has been seriously impinged upon and, as a consequence, it is being spoken less
and less in these communities. The number of speakers are estimated to be
approximately 700 (Wurm, 1977; 328)1 which presumably includes Eastern Torres
Strait Islanders living on other islands of the Torres Strait and on the mainland
of Australia in cities such as Townsville, Cairns or Mackay.
       The name itself, Meryam Mir, is drawn from the word mir meaning 'word,
language' and from the name of one of the clans living on Mer, the Meryam
people (from Mer 'Murray Island' and the morpheme -(y)am '(?)of a clan, of a
place'). It frequently appears in the literature written as Miriam or Meriam (Mir)
but to be consistent with the orthography used in this study, Meryam (Mir) is
chosen.
       Meryam Mir has an agglutinating morphology employing both prefixes
and suffixes. Its word order is basically A-0-V or S-V with the verb always in
word final position but with variation on the arguments' order depending on
pragmatic features. It has an extensive system of cross-reference markers on the
verb coding information about the number, person and syntactic nature of the
arguments as well as case inflections suffixed on nouns to indicate their syntactic
function within a clause. Thus, Meryam Mir can be regarded in typological
terms as a double-marking language (Nichols 1986; 72).","[11, 12]"
"2.2.1 Case Inflections
The case inflections are suffixed with the following forms:Case Markers              Common Nouns                      Proper Nouns
Ergative (A)                 -(i)de/-gize                       -(i)de

       Throughout this study, the terms A, Sand 0 will be used to refer to the
subject of a transitive verb (A), the subject of an intransitive verb (S) and the
object of a transitive verb (O) as employed by Dixon (1979; 61).",[42]
"5.9   Clause Relators.
      We saw in the section on deictic markers that these sometimes fulfill a
function parallel to that fulfilled by subordinate (relative) clause markers in other
languages. One of the main differences is the lack of syntactic dependency
between the two clauses although there is often intonational dependency                                                                             198
between the two. In addition, there are several clause relaters which overtly
signal a semantically subordinate relationship between the clause in which they
occur and the main clause. The verb in the subordinate clause, however, has full
inflectional markings, i.e. it is finite. Here are some of the relaters and an
example of each:
temporal clause relaters:

(Examples 5.107 and 5.108 are from the Social Security tape made by Mabo, S.)
causal relators:

          Det two persons Sg/DualS do-PastDual

           'The two people became castaways (and) thus, swam until they reached

                                                                          200
ko 'in order to (with no shared syntactic argument and it always follows the main
clause)' (<adverb 'again'?)

        'Flatten it so that it becomes really flat.'
       Some of the clause relators have other functions which do not mark a
dependent clause. For example, kewbu can either serve to introduce a temporal
dependent clause meaning 'after' or it can be used as an adverb meaning 'later,
behind':
(5.112) ka na- ba kewbu
        lSgS Futl-go later
        'I will go later /behind.'
       Clause relators can be distinguished from their other functions because
they always occur at the beginning of the clause (except when there is a pronoun
which can precede it).
       There is also a co-ordinating conjunction a 'and, or' which can link two
words, phrases or clauses together. This may be a borrowing from English 'and':

       A number of the clause relators can combine with each other providing
there is no conflict in meaning. A full description of the relators syntactic and
functional role within the clause or sentence awaits further study.","[209, 210, 211, 212, 213]"

       Note that the form *le-yba is unacceptable even though other common
nouns can be suffixed with this form. In contrast, the form -giz can be suffixed to
le 'person; according to some speakers,but not to other common nouns according
to others, e.g. ?kimyar-giz 'men (PIS)'.
       Although there are gaps in the examples illustrating all the case functions
and number distinctions, a tentative gloss and presentation of the paradigm is
given:
        nete 'who SgS'
        neti 'who SgO'
        netide 'who SgA'
        ?netiba 'who n SgA/S/O'

        na-le-gize 'which people n SgA'
        ?na-le-giz 'which people n SgS/O'
       The two groups given above can be paraphrased by each other in most

       Contrast 2.274 where the pronominal is indefinite with the following
example (2.275) where the pronominal is definite:

        'They then discussed as to which one of them would kill the castaway.'
        (Dewmer, p211, section18)
       A few examples have been collected with the interrogative pronoun
nalulu:
(2.276) na-       lu+lu          ge ta- ba- rmisi- lare            Dew-ge?
        Q clitic-thing+Intens? Deix Deix-Intr-prepare?-n PrlmpiPl D.- Loe

        Deix happiness Fut3-put Pauc/PlO-n Prlmpf
         'Why is he so happy?'
       Informants have said nalulu is the same as nalu 'what O'. However, the
English gloss might be better captured by 'what kind of X', i.e. what kind of thing
did they get up to yesterday at Dew? What kind of happiness is he feeling? (i.e.
what is the cause?). In other words, nalulu may be the interrogative word used
for asking information about a component of a compound. In order to verify this
claim, questions need to be elicited of the type:
What kind of hair does he have?
What type of house does he live in?
What kind of bananas do you grow? etc.","[84, 85, 86]"

"3.     Previous Research on the Language.
       Earlier work on Meryam has been limitgd in quantity and quality. In 1893,
Ray and Haddon published a study of vocabularies and grammatical notes drawn
from various missionaries', explorers' and researchers' notes. Unfortunately, the
study is subject to the contributors' spelling idiosyncracies, e.g. 'Maer' for Mer, to
interpretations of the sort: 'I think the variation of initial vowel is only due to
the influence of individual choice', and to dubious meanings because of personal
beliefs, e.g. omare 'mercy'.
       The most extensive study is that of Ray (1907) which provides some 40
pages of grammar, 30 pages of vocabulary and 30 pages of texts. Such a study
provides the opportunity to compare earlier and later forms of the grammar.
       A more recent work was undertaken by Bartos (1977), who provides a
preliminary study of the sounds of the language, and a paper by McConvell (1983};
who examines ergativity and verb agreement in the language to demonstrate that
Meryam cannot be said to be fully ergative or accusative in its system.
       In addition, there are a number of primary sources such as texts produced
by Meryam students at the School of Australian Linguistics in the newsletter
Ngali and field notes kindly made available by Rigsby.",[14]
"3.8.3 Inherent Aspectual Features of Verbs.
       Apart from the distinction of atelic stative from telic active verbs on
semantic and morphological grounds, there has been an implicit assumption
throughout the discussion on the meaning and function of temporal/ aspectual/
mood markers that all verbs can be affixed with these markers in order to yield a
meaning directly transparent to the verb root's meaning and the inflection.
Such a view is an over-simplification for it fails to account for the interaction
between verbs' meanings and inflections.
       A number of verbs have an inherently punctiliar meaning, that is they are
all events that have no duration. Verbs in this semantic class include ewmi 'die',
baraygi 'Sg/DualS dive in', baw 'Sg/DualS go in'. Also included in this class are
verbs which involve a specific number such as erapey 'buy Sg/DualO', igared
'take animate Sg/DualO', etaruk 'pick up Sg/DualO', etaker 'gather up Pauc/PlO'.
Some of these verbs are not readily affixed with markers conveying a durative
meaning. Sometimes, such a meaning can only be conveyed periphrastically:
(3.156) kara     ama     ewd- em eke-Ii
        lSgGen mothers dieN-All do?-PrlmpfSg
        'My mother is dying.'
        *kara ama ewmi-li
                   die- Prlmpf
                                                                            122
       For some verbs, only a related paucal/plural form that is indefinite in
number (or possibly generic in meaning) can be associated with durativity or
iterativity:
(3.157) able uteb- ge pe- ka          digwat-            Ii...
         Det place-Loe Deix-1SgA pull in Pauc/Pl fish-PrlmpfSg
         'The place (where) I fish .. .'
         *able uteb-ge pe-ka digwatmu-                Ii
                               pull in Sg/Dual fish
       The speaker is not saying that he catches many fish at that place nor that he
has caught many fish there. What is being conveyed is that it is the place
associated with a particular activity done at frequent intervals, namely fishing.
        With some verbs, a semi-productive morpheme dar- must be used to allow
a non-punctiliar associated meaning of the verb (See end of chapter on Non-
Productive Derivations, p142):
(3.158) e       b(a)- a-                 da(r)-li
         3SgS Intr- put in Sg/DualO-?-          PrlmpfSg
         'He is coming out.'
(3.159) ka mir           atrum-              da(r)-li
         1SgA wordO suggest Sg/DualO-?- PrimpfSg
         'I am suggesting something.'
        Not all verbs can be affixed with this morpheme to produce such a
meaning:
(3.160) *e       ewpama-         da(r)-li
           3SgS Sg/DualS jump-?-         PrlmpfSg
          'He is jumping.'
          ..re ewpamaret-li
               Pauc/PlS jump
        For a number of verbs, temporal/ aspectual markers are exploited lexically
in order to derive a related but slightly different meaning. Thus, durative
marking on a punctual verb such as ewmi 'die' produces a different lexeme in
Meryam meaning 'ache, wither'. Similarly, a punctiliar verb such as igared 'take
Sg/DualO animate' can produce a different lexeme when a durative inflection is
suffixed, namely 'be living with Sg/DualO animate in a defacto relationship':
 (3.161) kara       teter ewmi-li
          1SgGen footS die- PrimpfSg
          'My foot is aching.'
 (3.162) e       abi igared-                      Ii
          3SgA 3Sg0 take Sg/DualO animate-PrimpfSg
          'He is living with her.'","[133, 134]"
"1)     The nonsingular suffix -iba/-ibi is added to a singular noun in a complex
phrase to indicate that it is a member of a group of two or more. For example:
(2.91) kari       omay-iba mari omay-ey wi              ba- reg-        ley
        1SgGen dog- n Sg 2SgGen dog- Dual 3n SgS Intr-bite flesh-nPrlmpfDual
        'My dog and your dog, they bit each other.'
(2.92) wi         Sigar-iba na-     rdar-dare omaskir-kem
        3n SgA S.-     n Sg 3n SgO-see- Pauc children-Ass
        'They saw Sigar along with his children.'
         (?They, Sigar and his children, got seen.)
       As exemplified in the two sentences given above (2.91 and 2.92), -iba
merely indicates one of a group of two or more. There are no instances of this
suffix occurring with inanimate nouns. Could this be because speakers are less
interested in number reference with inanimates? Typically, with inanimate
objects, the nouns are simply juxtaposed:
(2.93) e       tabara sarik kep- kem giz- ge irm-                        i
         3SgA 3Gen bow arrow-Ass trunk-Loe stick Pauc/PlO into-Pf
         'He stuck his bow along with his arrow into the base of the tree.'
         (Dewmer, p209, sections)
       There is one example (2.94.) collected with -iba suffixed onto an inanimate
noun but it is an example collected through elicitation and the genitive case is
used within the complex phrase, a feature which is not normally permitted:
(2.94) ?ma kara          sogob- iba masis-ey na-          rapey-           0          2SgA 1SgGen ciggies-n Sg <Eng- Dual 3n SgO-buy Sg/Dual0-Fut2/3
         'Buy my cigarettes and matches.'
       The -iba suffix has been classified as an inflection for the following reasons:                                                                              46
•       The apparent restriction against the genitive case co-occurring with it in its
full form (excluding the example just given above). This is a restriction parallel
to that for inflections:
(2.95) taba koskir-                  iba omasker-kem
         3Gen (married)female-n Sg children- Ass
         'his wife along with his children'
(2.96) *taba-ra koskir-iba omasker-kem
                  Gen
•       A distinction in the form when affixed to a noun in a non-syntactic case,
namely -ibi. Thus, there are basically two forms for this affix: -iba for syntactic
cases and -ibi for non-syntactic cases. Here are some examples with the form -ibi:
(2.97) ka bakyamu- da Sigar-ibi uteb- em omasker-kem
         lSgS Sg/DualS go-PfSg S.-        n Sg place-All children-Ass
         'I went to Sigar and his children's place.'
(Note that in the above example 2.97, the -ibi phrase seems to be in a genitive case
function which could be interpreted as evidence of the genitive's fluid status as a
syntactic or non-syntactic case.)
(2.98) ... pa- ka ta- ba Irwered-ge Mesnare-ybi- (i)m Eydyana-ey
               Deix-lsgS Deix-go I.-      Loe M.-       n Sg-All E. -     Dual
         da-ra-         bger-i
            I -3n Sg0-1 call- Pf
         ' ... and then, I came to Irwered, to Mesnare and Eydyana's and invited
         them.'
(2.99) Bewr pe eypu- ge irdi                      Webok-ibi- lam a       Babud-ey
         B. S Deix middle-Loe n PIS be(place) W.-          n Sg-Abl Conj B.-     Dual
          'Bewr is half-way between Webok and Badud.'
        There is no distinction between the A, S or 0 argument when the
nonsingular inflection is affixed. Thus, one can use this suffix with an A
argument (2.100) or with an S argument (2.101):
(2.100) Lez-iba koskir-                 ey lewer ti- dikasr-eyey
         L. - n Sg (married)female-Dual foodO Deix-cook- PrlmpfDual
          'Les and his wife are cooking (there).'
 (2.101) Lez-iba kosker-                ey ta- bakyamu- daryey
          L.- n Sg (married)female-Dual Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfDual
          'Les and his wife came.'
        There is some ambiguity caused by this lack of distinction. With an
 intransitive verb, there will only be one core argument so the -iba phrase will
 have to be S. With a transitive verb, the non-iba phrase will either have an overt
 ergative case marker for A or it will be marked overtly for 0 if it is a pronoun or a
 proper noun. The only instance where it will be ambiguous is when a common
 noun is the 0 as this will be the -0 case marker with no way of distinguishing 0                                                                             47
from A. Of course, word order can always be used to disambiguate. Here is an
example where the overt 0 case marker on the personal pronoun allows the
addressee to interpret the -iba phrase as the A:
(2.102) neti- (i)ba yabi ne-      rwer-da?
         who-n Sg 3n Sg 3n Sg0-teach-P£Pl
         'Who(pl) taught them?'
       There is some diachronic and synchronic evidence which suggests that the
suffix -iba is related to the pronominal plural genitive case form (see section 2.3
p68 on Pronouns for more details). The nonsingular genitive pronominal forms
which are relevant to this discussion are:
1n Sg Exel keriba
       Incl meriba
2n Sg          waba
3n Sg          wiyaba I yaba
       The nonsingular forms which all end in -(i)ba correspond closely in form
as well as in function to the nominal nonsingular affix -iba.
       In addition, Ray in his study (1893) gives the following examples to indicate
a pair or a group:
(2.103) keriba           Pasi-ey bakyamu-        ley      Dawar-em
         1n SgExclGen P.- Dual Sg/DualS go-PastDual D.-          All
         'We (exd dual), Passi and I, went to Dawar.'(lbid; 61)
         (the glosses are my own)
(2.104) mi          merbi-      tkem na-     mri-                da
         1n Sglnd ln SglndO-Ass      1/2Sg?-Sg/DualS sit down-PfSg
         'We sat down in one another's company/You sat down along with us.'(?)
         (Ibid; 64)
       Although there are no examples in Ray's data of this construction being
used with nominals such as those given for modern Meryam Mir, the reader
should note that in at least one of Ray's examples, the plural genitive pronoun is
used to indicate the plural pair. This parallels the examples found in the present-
day language where the -iba is affixed to nominals for similar effect.
       The earlier Meryam Mir examples both differ and resemble modern
Meryam Mir with regard to pronominals. Like the earlier form of the language, a
nonsingular pronoun is required in this construction:
(2.105) ki            ama- ey bakyamu- daryey
         1n SgExdS mother-Dual Sg/DualS go-PfDual
          'We two, mother and I, went.'
(2.106) wi        ama- ypkem na-         mr-                eder
         3n SgS mother-Ass       3n SgS-Pauc/PlS be seated-n Prlmpf
          'They were seated, him along with the mothers.'
       Note that if there is possession, it must be with the reduced form:                                                                            48
(2.107) ki         kerbi       ama- yey

            ln SgExclGen
       * keriba amayey
       'we two, mother and I'2)     The privative suffix -kak is added to (pro)nominals to indicate the absence
or the lack of something:
(2.108) e       bar-       kak mir dike
        3SgS crookedN-Priv word n PIS be(word)
        'That is the right word.'
         (lit: it is a word without crookedness)

         lSgS Neg sleepN-Priv 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'I am not sleepy.'
         (lit: I am without sleep)
       It can be used with pronouns or animate nouns as well to denote their
absence at a particular place:
(2.111) nole abi- tkak meta- ge irdi-                 redi
         Neg 3Sg0-Priv house-Loe n SgS be(place)-Pr
         'He was not there at the house.'
         (lit: There/It is without him at the house)
       When it occurs within a noun phrase, it must precede the head noun and
the stem will operate in an adjectival or attributive function. As such, it might be
considered a derivation. For example:
(2.112) able mir- kak newr-                    ide abi ep-          Ii
         Det word-Priv unmarried female-A 3Sg0 carry Sg/DualO-Primpf
         'The quiet silent girl is carrying him.'
       Nominalised verbs can also be used with this affix:
(2.113) ese ma aspir- kak apu             a      bab
         if 2SgS marryN-Priv mother Conj father
         ma n(a)- a-                     Ii...

          'If you are an unmarrried mother or father .. .'","[57, 58, 59, 60]"
"Comparison with Adjectives.
       It was mentioned in the introduction that compounds, be they listed as
lexemes or produced through a productive process, share comparable and
diverging features with adjectives.
        Similarities between these two groups have been alluded to above. It was
seen that the compound types frequently exhibit the pattern in which Nl
provides more information about N2. Adjectives which precede the noun they
modify fulfil a similar function because they too provide additional information
about the referent of the noun. In formal terms, the Nl of a compound and
adjectives both precede the head noun and both fulfil a modifier-type function.
        However, most adjectives are derived from nouns by a process of
reduplication whereas nouns in a compound structure do not undergo such a
derivational process (see the section on Adjectives, p75).
        There are a number of examples in the data which contrast a modifying
noun and a modifying adjective. Consider:
(2.226) ni       pat
         water well
          'water well'
(2.227) ni+ni         domboy
          water Adj doughboy
          'boiled doughboys'
(2.228) ur bi
          fire light
          'firelight'
 (2.229) ur+ur tup
          fire Adj sardine
          'roasted sardines'
 (2.230) kerim le
          head person
          'boss, chairman'
 (2.231) kerim+kerim werem
          head Adj       child
          'stubborn child'
                                                                            65
     (2.232) le       ut     uteb
             person sleepN place
             'cemetery'
     (2.233) ut+ut       we rem
             sleep Adj child
             'sleepy child'
     (2.234) ut+ut       waywi
             sleep Adj mango
             'overripe mango'
             (i.e. one which has been lying on the ground for several days)
            Semantic differences between the two types are not easily captured.
     Wierzbicka (1988) when discussing differences between nouns and adjectives
     makes the claim that nouns 'identify a certain kind of person, a kind of thing, a
     kind of animal (Ibid; 469) ...endowed with certain properties; whereas adjectives
     designate properties as such (and more specifically what is seen as) a single
     property' (Ibid; 472). Whilst her explanation has been formulated to capture
     differences between independent nouns and adjectives, it does seem that her
     comments are pertinent to the differences between a modifying noun in a
     compound and an adjective. In compounds, the first noun often provides
     information which identifies the kind of referent it is, whereas adjectives provide
     information concerning a particular property of the referent.
            Givon (1984; 51) in his account of the differences between independent
     nouns and adjectives provides a semantic explanation which seems to partly
     capture the difference between modifying nouns and adjectives. His claim is that
     nouns refer to the most stable conditions, adjectives to intermediate states (as
     opposed to verbs which are events of most rapid change). With compounds, the
     modifying noun often refers to a permanent and inherent quality of the head
.i   noun, whereas with adjectives, it is often an impermanent quality and often the
 !
     result of a process.
            Neither approach satisfactorily distinguishes between modifying nouns
     and adjectives. However, neither Wierzbicka nor Givon formulated their ideas
     in order to account for modifying nouns although features such as 'the kind of
     thing' and 'permanence' capture some of the differences. A language which
     heavily exploits such a distinction can contribute in refining and modelling these
     semantic claims.","[76, 77]"

front vowel. The environment in which this happens is before a morpheme
commencing with an initial vowel. This rule must be ordered after the vowel
loss or reduction rule. Note that vowel harmony can also occur across consonant
clusters:

"3.12   Adverbs.
       There are only two words which occur exclusively as adverbs. These are
nab '(attempt) unsuccessfully' and mirem 'try':

         'She unsuccessfully waited for her son, ""Geygi, why is he taking so long? I
         will try to look for him.""'
       Other words have been collected functioning as adverbs. These could
exclusively be adverbs as they have not been found functioning in any other
context:
(3.245) kuti+kuti 'headfirst' <kuti?
         ka kuti+kuti ka na- baraygi-                  lu

          'I, like my father, scooped sardines singlehandedly.'
        Many adverbs have been found with other functions such as adjectives,
nouns, clause relators, exclamations or a combination of these functions. To
illustrate this, consider:

      In this study, the syllable has been arbitrarily selected as corresponding to
the following types. A syllable must minimally consist of a vowel:
V      o 'liver' VG aw 'big'           GV wi '3n Sg' GVG         way 'coconut seed'
CV pi 'dust' CVG pew 'wing' CGV Pyu name CGVG syaw 'sneeze'
VC op 'face' VGC Awm name GVC wir 'coal' GVGC ways 'take Fut3'
CVC pit 'nose' CVGClayp 'ear'          CGVCnyap 'thirst'CGVGC (no examples)
       Some elaboration is required. The glides, at least with regard to the syllable
structure, need to be distinguished from consonants as glides can occur with
consonants in a word-initial and word-final cluster whereas a consonant cluster
(i.e. with no glides) is not possible in these positions. Consequently, I have
chosen to treat them as a distinct class in order to preserve phonotactic
generalizations. However, note that glides and consonants share features as one
would expect and it is sometimes arbitrary to label a sound sequence such as pew
'wing, flipper' of the type CVG rather than CVC. For reasons given above, the
distinction is best maintained. Any phonemic sequence that is longer than the
sequences listed is regarded as non-monosyllabic. Consider, for example:
        way.su 'vagina'
        ma.yu 'golden trevally'
        mwey.ni 'woven mat for scooping things'
        mak.rem - ma.krem 'unmarried male'
        kim.yar - ki.myar 'married male'
        i.k6s 'spear (verb)'
        is.mi - i.smi 'cut Sg/DualO'
      It is sometimes difficult to determine where the boundary lies between two
syllables. In such instances, ambisyllabicity must be assigned. This is the case
when there is a consonant cluster of two consonants or a consonant plus glide.
When there is a glide and consonant cluster, the glide is assigned to the previous
syllable and the consonant to the following syllable. H there is a single consonant
or glide, then it is typically perce·1ved as belonging to the syllable following.
       In addition, affixed morphemes affect the type of syllable structure
permitted. To illustrate, consider the following sequence /ks/ found in sek+sek
'wrong, bad' (from the reduplicated form sek?). Compare this to the verb iski
'spear Pf' which is derived from the root ikos suffixed with the perfective
marker -i triggering final vowel deletion (parallel to the verb dirpi 'sweep '\'f '
derived from the verb root dirup). Thus, reduplication allows different
consonant clusters to those found at oiher morpheme boundaries.","[29, 30]"

           'I will eat first.'
         For some words, it feels intuitively that the adverbial function is primary
with the secondary function having developed from it. Adverbs such as kikem
'firstly', emetu 'already', mena 'still, continue', etc. Unfortunately, there is no
linguistic evidence to either refute or support such a claim.
         Although it is not possible to isolate these words as being uniquely or even
primarily an adverb, their function is clearly adverbial. Adverbs contribute
information about the manner:
(3.253) ma ta-            ba dudum+dudum
           2SgS Deix-go quick
           'Come quickly.'

           'Why is Geygi so long (away)?'

           'His boat sank very close to Wayer.'
about the event itself:
(3.256) ...e-         ge emetu ba- yw-i
               3SgS-Deix already Intr-dig-Pf
            '... (but) he had already buried himself.'
         As can be noted from the examples, adverbs covered in this section do not
have any inflections or affixes. (Adverbial phrases do occur as illustrated in the
section on inflections). Their position is relatively free in the sentence although
they tend not to occur in word initial position.
         Several of the words used adverbially appear in reduplicated form. This
might be done for two reasons. It may be to derive an adverb from a noun, i.e.
 dudum-ge 'in haste' (lit: haste-Loe), dudum+dudum 'quickly'; nyay-em 'forever'
 (lit: long time-All), nyay+nyay 'eternally'. Note that since this parallels
 reduplicated forms for adjectives, reduplication could be viewed as a syntactic                                                                            144
process for deriving nouns into modifiers, be they adjectives or adverbs.
However, somewhat similar to adjectives, reduplicated adverbs also imply a
greater intensity, i.e. mayk-e 'dose-by' (lit: close-Loe) versus mayk+mayk 'very
dose-by'. Thus, reduplication is both a syntactic and semantic process for adverbs
as well.","[154, 155, 156]"
"5.3     The Verb Complex.
        There are a number of uninflected nominals occurring within a sentence.
These must be considered as part of the verb complex. Consider the following
examples:
(5.35) ter mayso [mir iga- Ii]
          reef noises word speak-Prlmpf
          'The surf is crashing down noisily.'
(5.36) Galiga [ut ipe-                 redi]
          G.S     sleep n PIS be lying-Pr
          'Galiga is sleeping.'
        The nominals mir 'word' and ut 'sleep' must be part of the verbal phrase
for the following reasons. The verbs given above are intransitive as evidenced by
zero marking on the S argument so the non-S argument cannot be 0. Its
function must be part of the verb phrase. Other arguments found in support of
this analysis follow.
        Nominals in the verbal phrase must occur immediately preceding the verb,
which suggests they form a syntactic unit:
(5.37) *mir ter mayso igali
          'The surf is crashing down noisily.'
(5.38) *ut Galiga iperedi
          'Galiga is sleeping.'
        There is some suprasegmental evidence that the nominal and verb form a
single phonological unit. The main pitch-accent of the verb phrase is carried on
the nominal when it is mono-syllabic and the verb itself begins with a vowel,
e.g. tit ipe 'n PIS be lying asleep', but ipe 'n PIS be lying'.
        However, there are instances where the nominal's role is not
straightforward and it could either be a verbal nominal (i.e. within the verbal                                                                          187
complex) or a syntactic argument of the verb. Consider the following examples
where the verb might be di-transitive or transitive with a complex verb phrase:
(5.39) koskir-             ide lumi dikris-li      uteb- ge
        (married)female-A weed dear- Prlmpf place-Loe
        'The woman is clearing her place.'
(5.40) koskir-             ide (uteb) lumi dikris-li
        (married)female-A placeO weed dear- Prlmpf
        'The woman is clearing (her place).'
       In 5.39, number reference for the nonA nominal (be it 0 or whatever) is
automatically plural and no further cross-reference marking can be used. As 0
arguments for transitive verbs can be cross-referenced on the verb for number,
one must assume that the nominal is not an 0 and thus part of the verb complex.
Contrasting with this, in 5.40, number specification for 0 is singular, referring to
the number of yards, and cross-reference marking can be used to indicate
nonsingular number as exemplified below:
(5.41) koskir-             ide neys uteb lumi da-ra-        kris- i
         (married)female-A two placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-Pf
         'The woman cleared two yards.'
(5.42) koskir-             ide neys a    netat uteb lumi da-ra-        kris- idare
         (married)female-A two Conj one placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-P£Pauc
         'The woman cleared several yards.'
(5.43) koskir-             ide mitkar uteb lumi da-ra-        kris- a
         (married)female-A many placeO weed I -3n Sg0-1 dear-P£Pl
         'The woman cleared many yards.'
       The cross-reference markers for 0 provide syntactic evidence that the
nominal lurni 'weed' is part of the verbal complex and not an 0 argument.
       Given that there are complex verbal phrases in the language, it may be
possible to interpret one of the arguments of a di-transitive verb as a nominal
within the verb phrase rather than a syntactic argument. Consider an example
with a di-transitive verb such as ikwar 'give':
(5.44) ka       abi lu        ikwar-          i
         lSgA 3Sg0 thingO give Sg/DualO-Pf
         'I gave him something.'
(5.45) ka        abi lu      na-      kwar-         i
          lSgA 3Sg0 thingO 3n SgO-give sg/ dualO-Pf
          'I gave him two things.'
          (cross-reference marking to the inanimate 0 argument lu 'thing')
 (5.46) ka       yabi lu        na- kwar-             da
          lSgA 3n SgO thingO 3n Sg-give Sg/DualO-PfFl
          'I gave them something.'
          (cross-reference marking to the animate 0 argument yabi '3n SgO')                                                                           188
       As either of the nonA nominals can be cross-referenced on the verb (5.45
and 5.46), one must assume that both nominals are syntactic arguments of the
verb with the specification that only one of the arguments can be cross-referenced
at any one time on the verb. More examples need to be collected with (di)-
transitive verbs to prove this.
       A couple of transitive verbs have been collected where the nominal can
either be part of the verb complex or a syntactic argument:
(5.47) ka       mara mir        asr- i
         1SgA 2SgGen wordO hear-Pf
         'I heard your message.'
(5.48) ka lar- ira gepi           ditkiri-   (i)
         1SgA fish-Gen scalesO peel,scrape-Pf
         'I scaled the fish.'
(5.49) ka       mari mir n(a)-      asr- i
         1SgA 2Sg0 word 1/2Sg0-hear-Pf
         'I heard you (talking).'
(5.50) ka kumala              gegur ditkiri-      (i)
         1SgA sweet potatoO peel peel,scrape-Pf
         'I peeled the sweet potato.'
       It is unclear what the semantic distinction is between the two types. One
possibility may be that the nominal incorporated into the verbal phrase (5.49 and
5.50) is indefinite whilst the non-incorporated nominal (5.47 and 5.48) is definite.
An alternative explanation would be that the incorporated nominal focusses on
the activity itself whilst the non-incorporated nominal focusses on an end-point,
a purpose. Note, however, that for many verbs, there is no choice.
       There are examples of lexicalised complex verb phrases, that is where the
noun is an inseparable part of the verb phrase and its meaning. Examples of
lexicalised complex verb phrases include for intransitive verbs: i ezo 'cry'
(<tearN, shed?), erer ekri 'shout, squawk' (<shoutN, emit?), segur etker 'play'
(<playN, ?), kobek esi 'cough' (<coughN, bang down upon waves), and for
transitive verbs: upi diti 'help' (<tail?,?), lag dasur 'smell' (<smellN, ?), tag
digwat 'shake hands' (<hand, pull), op dipit 'meet' (<face, hit?), tep diskir 'taste'
(<skin of fruit, activity to do with mouth?).
       Within complex verbal phrases, a nominal can always be isolated from the
verbal component because verbal inflections occur only on the verb, not on the
nominal, and the nominal can always occur as an independent lexeme. It seems
that the generalization is as follows: at one end of the continuum, there are
nominals functioning as syntactic arguments of the verb and at the other end of
the continuum, there are nominals within verbal phrases forming an essential
part of the verb phrase's meaning. In between these two extremes, there are
                                                                            189
some verbs which allow both types to occur and these are exploited for various
stylistic purposes.

         The structure of a noun complex is as follows:Determiner-          N[modifier]-      N[head]       - giz 'Pl'
                     lAdjective                      ·(iba-ibi 'n Sg') £N-kem 'Ass'

          Det many baskets Deix I -3n SgS- I PIS be resting upon

(5.52) [able kebi bam+bam nar ] pe ikase

         'The little yellow van is going by.'
(5.53) lim-ira bi
        sun-Gen light
         'sunlight'
      Case inflections are suffixed to the head or clitic immediately following the
head, i.e. giz, iba-ibi. Genitive nouns follow the order with the possessor (the
modifier) preceding the possessed (the head).
      The plural marker -giz(e) always directly follows the noun which it
modifies:
(5.54) gayr le-         gize kari na-     tager-da
         alot person-PIA lSgO 1/2Sg0-tell- P£Pl
         'Alot of people told me.'
       The marker -giz(e) behaves like inflections, which are always suffixed to the
noun. It can be regarded as a post-clitic since it forms a single phonological unit
with the noun, i.e. there is a single pitch-accent, e.g. netat le '1 person', gayr le-giz
'many people'.
       Not included in the structure of the noun complex outlined above are
locational adjuncts often involving a nominal and a locational noun acting like a
kind of postposition. Both are inflected for case:

      Note that the suffixes are affixed to a noun phrase which is part of a more
complex noun phrase, be it a pronoun or another noun.
       Inclusion is an essential feature of this construction. If a pronoun occurs, it
must refer to the sum of the participants and the associative or dual phrase is
subordinate to it. Note that the cross-reference markers always treat the complex
noun phrase as non-singular. Below are examples to demonstrate the
grammaticality with a nonsingular pronoun and the unacceptability with a
singular pronoun:
(2.85) wa       net- ipkem bakyaw-         da pamas-em?
        2n SgS who-Ass       Pauc/PlS go-P£Pl shop- All
         'With whom did you go to the shops?'

         'We, mother and I, went to the shops.'
         *ka amaey bakyamudaryey pamasem
       It remains to be established whether the use of the associative suffix is a
distinct function and meaning. In this use, it has noun phrase function rather
than clause function. Clearly, however, the two uses are related in meaning.
Participation in the event is marked by the case of the complex whole noun
phrase and by the verbal cross-referencing.
  Several sentence types need to be elicited in order to validate these claims:
 • whether the associative phrase can ever be linked to an 0 argument, e.g. I saw
the man with his walking stick, or, I saw the man walking with his brother.
 • whether the associative phrase can be used with a transitive verb with a plural
agent, e.g. They unloaded the things in front of Les (who did not help at all).
 • whether the nonsingular marker attached to the first nominal in the complex
phrase can be omitted when it is an animate, e.g. Sigar omasker-kem bakyawda
Dawarem 'Sigar and his children went to Dawar.'","[54, 55]"

"8.    The ablative case (-lam/-ilam), like the allative case, has local, temporal
and causal meanings. It is used to mark the point from which there is
movement away:
(2.51) e      op- dewday- lam ta- bakyamu- da
         3SgS face-mainland-Ahl Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg
         'He came from Papua New Guinea.'
(2.52) e      t-    ab-          i paser-lam
         3SgS Deix-climb down-Pf hill- Ahl
         'He came down from the hill.'
       This case inflection can also be used to mark the cause (of a non-finite
clause):
(2.53) ka gim+gim n(a)- a-                        Ii      waywi aro- lam
         lSgS illness Adj 1/2SgS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf mangoO eatN-Abl
         'I am sick from eating mangoes.'
       It can also be extended in meaning to include a temporal notion, i.e. to
mark from a particular point in time:
(2.54) ki-lam 'from/ since last night'
         emeret-lam 'from a long time ago'9.     The genitive case (-ira - -ra) is used to mark the beneficiary or goal of an
action:
(2.55) ka laglag epey           a- rapey-           lu      kari    ama- ra
        lSgS wantN basketO Futl-buy Sg/DualO-FutlSg lSgGen mother-Gen
        'I want to buy a basket for my mother.'
       Note that there is overlap in the functions of the allative case with its
purposive function and the genitive case with its beneficiary function. (It remains
to be tested whether it can also be used as a maleficiary.) It could be argued that in
Meryam Mir, the genitive case includes within its meaning both a benefactive
and purposive meaning. This would account for the more felicitous and
common sentence given below with the genitive rather than the allative case:
(2.56) kara      mekir          ageg            t-  iruk-       o
         lSgGen almond(tree) fleshy fruit?O Deix-pluck PIO-Fut2/3sg
        'Pick me some almonds.'
         ?kari-m mekir ageg tiruk
               -All
       The two cases, namely the genitive and allative case, must have some
overlap in their function as well as permitting some slight nuance in meaning
because there are examples where the two cases co-occur within a single sentence:
                                                                              39
(2.57)  ka abra         kerkar wali         ti- d- irapey-            da

        tciwn-ge abi- m
        town-Loe 3Sg-All
        'I bought him a new shirt in town.'
       Clearly more work needs to be done in this area to refine the distinctions
between the allative and genitive cases.
       The genitive case is used to mark the possessor/owner of an alienable or
inalienable object/physical quality /person/body part:
(2.58) ka pleyn-ira bUm.er d-              asr- i
        lsgA <Eng- Gen soundO 3Gen-hear-Pf
        'I heard the plane's noise.'
(2.59) Warib-ira tag                ismi-da
        W.-      Gen hand/fingers cut- PfSg
        'W arib's finger got cut.'
(2.60) Lez-ira newbet ewmi-da
        L.- Gen FZ S die- PfSg
        'Les' aunty died.'
       The genitive case can also be used to mark the experiencer of a physical or
emotional state:
(2.61) Galiga-ra werer         bark- i
        G.-       Gen hungers happen-Pf
        'Galiga is hungry /Hunger happened for Galiga.'
(2.62) able le-       ra weku bark- i
        Det person-Gen angers happen-Pf
        'That person is angry I Anger happened for that person.'
       The genitive case cannot occur when the complex noun phrase itself is
marked by a case as in the following examples. In 2.63, it cannot occur with the
locative case; in 2.64, it cannot occur with the ergative case; in 2.65, it cannot
occur with the semblative case and in 2.66, it cannot occur within a noun phrase
itself marked by the genitive case:
(2.63) e       ta- da-                Ii       Lez-i uteb- ge
         3SgS Deix-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf L- ? place-Loe
         'He is over there at Les' place.'

         The ending suffixed or pronominal form for the absent genitive is
phonologically homophonous with the 0 argument case form for proper nouns,
i.e. -i,or the accusative pronominal form. One could speculate that the case
marker for this argument is the accusative/ dative case marker as it is used in
adnominal possession, it is typically the base for oblique inflections on proper
nouns and pronouns and, it is used to mark definite or human direct objects.
Another possibility is that there are alternations in the form of the genitive case
morpheme itself, i.e. -i ,.. -y, used when the complex noun phrase in which it
occurs carries another case inflection. Evidence that these are indeed
morphological alternations of the genitive case can be seen by the fact that these
case markers also occur with common nouns (which do not take the case suffix -i
in the accusative case) when they are in a possessor relation within a case-marked
complex phrase:
(2.67) kari        newr-i      kimyar-      ide abi detagr-i
           1SgGen girl- Gen (married)male-A 3Sg0 tell- Pf
           'My daughter's husband told him.'
         Contrast with the lexical compound newr kimyar 'sister-in-law' where
there is no genitive marking (2.83):
(2.68) kari newr kimyaride abi detagri
           'My sister-in-law told him.'
         Another example follows of a common noun suffixed with the alternative
form of the genitive case:
 (2.69) able ama-        y werm-et abi detagr-i
           Det mother-Gen child- SgA 3Sg0 tell- Pf
           'The mother's son told him.'
           *able ama wermet abi detagri
         Although the genitive case marker cannot be confused with the accusative
 case marker in the examples given above, there are many examples in the third
 person singular where these two functions cannot be distinguished, that is where
 the (pro)nominal phrase could be analysed as the 0 argument or as the
 phonologically reduced genitive case. For example:                                                                           41

person objects or 3rd person non-singular objects will be cross-referenced on the

       -ira I elsewhere            ex. newr-ira omay 'the girl's dog'  10.     The associative case (-kem) is suffixed to an inanimate noun to indicate
  that it was associated although not used to perform the action:

           3SgS walk- Pf walking stick-Ass

           'He gathered up his things with these words: .. .'
          Contrast the above examples with the following where the instrumental

  (2.76) e digm-i koket-u
                             -Instr
           'He walked using his walking stick.'

           (lit: they (2) did things to each other using words)
          The associative case -kem and the allomorph -ipkem (used with proper
  nouns and possibly with kinship terms, e.g. ama-ypkem 'along with mothers),                                                                            42
are used to indicate that the person was associated with a particular event
although not a participant:
(2.78) lu      ba- kawert-                 i Lez-ipkem
        thingS Intr-take down Sg/DualO-Pf L.- Ass
        'The things were unloaded in Les' presence.'
       A similar form and parallel use occurs with pronominals:
(2.79) Dawgiri erkep ikered-            er        ge Bame-y erdar-i
        D. S     eye n PIS be(thing)-n Prlmpf Deix B-         0 see- Pf
        ta- ba- rb- i abi-tkem we- ge akarik-da
        Deix-Intr-row-Pf 3Sg-Ass sand-Loe land- PfSg
        'Dawgiri was watching when he saw Bame swimming (towards the area
        where Dawgiri was) and right in front of Dawgiri, Bame came up onto the
        beach.' (Dewmer p210, section12)
       Andrews (1985) makes a useful distinction between circumstantial and
participatory roles which correspond neatly to the associative versus
instrumental case. The associative case involves a circumstantial role as the
phrase forms ""part of the setting of the event"" whilst the instrumental case
involves a participatory role with the phrasE; an ""actual participant in the
situation implied by the verb"" (Andrews, Ibid; 69). An argument marked with
-kem/-ipkem is signalling that the thing/person was present although not an
instrument or participant in the activity.
       How does the associative differ from the locative when the locative case
carries a comitative meaning? Whilst the locative case is marked on an animate
noun to indicate thats/he performed the same action at the same place as the
S/ A, the associative case is also marked on an animate noun but to indicate that
s/he was at the same place although not performing the event/activity.
However, there is a further use of the associative suffix which is exploited in a
participatory role to indicate paucal or plural inclusion; in this use, it is always
within a complex noun phrase. This function will be examined in the following
section.","[50, 51, 52, 53, 54]"

                                                                           179
4.5    Status and Grammatical Function of Deictic Markers.
       The deictic markers' status is ambiguous. Phonologically, they appear to be
independent words capable of bearing their own pitch-accent. (Pronouns either
get pre or postcliticized onto them):
(4.145) e-     pe ta- bakyamu- da
         3SgS-Deix Deix-Sg/DualS go-PfSg
         'Then he came.'
(4.146) Kosir pe tabakyamuda
         'Kosir then came.'
       When they are being used with spatial reference, they often carry stronger
stress marking (evidenced by higher amplitude) which thus adds emphasis:
       Determining the deictic markers' position in a sentence is problematic.
There is a tendency for them to occur directly preceding the predicate or
following the first element in the clause, i.e. A/S-deictic-(0)-V, a position itself
frequently associated with clitics. Nonetheless, they frequently occur in a differeni
position although these are always predictable. They sometimes occur in clause
initial position when the A/S is omitted because its identity is already established
(see example 4.149). They sometimes occur following the verb bakyamu-/bakyaw-
'go'. When the deictic markers follow the verb, they always have the goal
meaning:
(4.147) e      baka ge
         3SgSgo Deix
         'He went there.'
       Their grammatical status makes them clearly dependent as they cannot
occur without a verb:
(4.148) e      nade da-                Ii?      pe da-                Ii
         3SgS where n PlS be(person)-Prlmpf Deix n PlS be(person)-Prlmpf
          'Where is he? He is there.'
        *pe
        *Npe
      Do the deictic markers carry a phoric/ co-referential element in their
meaning and do they have a syntactic role? There are examples where the subject
and deictic marker cannot co-occur within the same clause which suggests that
the markers do indeed carry some kind of phoric/ co-referential element and do
have a syntactic function. Consider:
(4.149) ki          bakyamu- daryey pamas-em able aw le-            kem
        1n SgExclS Sg/DualS go-PfDual shop- All Det big person-Ass

        'I went to the shops with the old man who is always growling me/ I went
        to the shops with the old man; the one always growling me.'","[190, 191]"
"                                                                            49
          (from the tape made for Social Security)
        The suffix can also be used with nominalised verbs in a negative
imperative:
(2.114) ma nole aro- kak
          2SgA Neg eatN-Priv
          'Do not eat (it).'
(The above use needs to be tested with nonsingular (pro)nouns to see whether it
is still possible without the usual cross-referencing for number on the verb.)
         Morphemes beginning with a voiceless velar stop such as the privative
suffix -kak or the intensifier suffix -kar (see section 4 below p52) devoice the final
consonant of the root if it is a voiced stop:
/b/        >        p/-+k                      kap-kar 'original M.I. dance'
/d/         >       t                          (>kab 'dance' + kar 'intensifier')
/g/        >        k                          tebut-kak 'without friend'
                                               (>tebud 'friend' + kak 'privative')
                                               la(k)-kak 'dislike, not want'
                                               (>lag 'desire, want' + kak 'privative')3)     The semblative suffix -ise is affixed to a (pro)nominal which is the object of
comparison. There are no examples of this affix followed by a case inflection:
(2.115) e     eper-da ebur-ise
        3SgS fly- PfSg bird- Smbl
        'He flew like a bird.'
(2.116) Gilam -ide ab+ab- ise dikepwar-er               lamar koskir
        G.-       A formerN-Smbl think-        n Primpf spirit (married) femaleO
        'Gilam thought as he had the last time that (she) was a ghost.'
       The suffix -ise is frequently preceded by an affix -ka whose meaning is not
clear. Examples of its use are:
(2.117) ma pe siga           iri- Ii      kari-ka-yse
        2SgA Deix ciggieO drink-Primpf lsg- ?- Smbl
         'You smoke cigarettes as I do.'

         ab-     ka-yse mokakalam Erub-ge
         former-?- Smbl like/as       E.- Loe
         'They (2) did the same thing as what they had done at Erub.'

         another persons knowN-Priv Fut3-make K.-          gen?-?- Smbl
         'No-one knows how to make it (cocnnuted rice) like one's Kosir.'
(Note that in the above sentence, the privative phrase is functioning like a
predicate.)                                                                               50
      It may be that the semblative suffixes -kayse and -ise do not signal any
meaningful difference but are simply in free alternation. Alternatively, it may beO,
mor.photogical distinction where common nouns take the form -ise and other
nominals (pronouns and proper nouns) take the form -kayse.
        The suffix -kayse is also used with adjectives with a comparative effect:
(2.120) able wag kikem kelar- kak wam-i
         Det windS first       strength-Priv blow-Pf
         a       no abra       kelar     aw-ka-yse batay-0
         Conj Restr 3SgGen strengths big-?- Smbl grow-Pf
         'At first, the wind blew without strength (but then), its strength just
         grew bigger (or big-like?).'
        The related suffix -ka, which is often reduplicated on adjectives, occurs as a't\i
intensifier to indicate a greater or lesser degree:
(2.121) e       aw le      da-               Ii
         3SgS big person n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'He is a big/old man.'
(2.122) e       aw-ka+ka le          da-             Ii
         3SgS big- Intens person n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'He is a very big/old person.'
        In 2.122, -ka(ka) is functioning as an adjectival intensifier. There is a
similar derivation -kar which is added to nouns as an intensifier with the
meaning 'the real N, the even more like N':
(2.123) keymer-          kar
         young sibling-Intens
         'the youngest sibling'
(2.124) u-          kar    pe da-                 Ii
         coconut-Intens Deix n PIS be(person?)-Prlmpf
         'Those are the proper kind of palm trees.'
        The suffix -ka occurring on adjectives and the suffix -kar occurring on
nouns could be related and these in turn are probably related to the semblative
construction with -kayse.
        There are comparative constructions with the ablative case used to mark a
standard comparison (2.125 and 2.126) and the allative case used to mark the
property with respect to which a comparison is made (2.127):
 (2.125) yaba         mir wi          dipigeme-daryey, akay-da yaba            mir
          3n SgGen wordO 3n SgA change- PfDual do- Pfsg 3nonsggen wordS

          'They (2) changed their language (Central Islanders') so that it became
          slightly different from (that) spoken at Mabyog.'","[60, 61, 62]"
"7.    The allative case is used to mark the goal/place of motion:
(2.37) ka n(a)- akome-            lu      meta- em
         lSgS Futl-n PIS return-FutlSg house-All
         'I will go home.'

         3n SgS PIS-climb down-Pf ground-All
         'They climbed down to the ground.'
       It is also used to mark the purposive (of a non-finite clause):
(2.39) ki             na- ba lewer-em
         ln SgExclS Futl-go food- All
         'We (excl) will go for food.'

         lSgA/S? unmarried female-All see-         Prlmpf
         'I am looking for the girl.'
       It can also be used as an indirect object, to mark the noun phrase toward
which the action is directed. For this reason, the allative case could have been
glossed as the dative case as it appears to fulfil some of the functions of the dative.
However, as many of the functions are also covered by a second accusative case,
the use of the term dative has been omitted from the case system altogether.
Following are some examples of the allative case with indirect object function:
(2.41) e        deketi-      da
         3SgS look quickly-PfSg
          'He glanced over.'
(2.42) e        nar- em deketi-        da
          3SgS boat-All look quickly-PfSg
          'He glanced over at the boat.'",[48]
"5.2.2 Experiencer type Clauses.
      There is only one verb which has been collected to date where the
agreement on the verb appears to be determined by the number of the possessor,
not the number of the possessed. Consider the following examples:
(5.30) kara      nyap bark- i
        1SgGen thirsts happen-Pf
        'I am thirsty I Thirst happened to me.'
(5.31) yaba        nyap barug- da
        3n SgGen thirstS happen-PfPl
        'They were thirsty I Thirst happened to them.'
(5.32) keriba           werer bark- iyey
        ln SgExclGen hungers happen-PfDual
        'We two (excl.) are hungry I Hunger happened to us (excl).'
      The experience itself could be regarded as either the same phenomenon
shared by all experiencers, in which case, one would expect singular marking on
the verb or it could be regarded as a phenomenon experienced individually by
each of the experiencers. It is this latter interpretation which is suggested by the
verbal marking. Alternatively, the structure suggests that the possessor has
subject properties by virtue of its initial position in the clause and verb
agreement.
       Both this construction and equational clauses can be used for experiences.
The distinction between the two is unclear:
                                                                             186

(5.34) abra      nyap bark- i
        3SgGen thirsts happen-Pf
        'He is (now) thirsty I Thirst happened to him.'
      The distinction may be that existential sentences convey a state whereas
experiencer type clauses convey a change of state, or it may be that one state is
more permanent than another. Examples need to be elicited to test whether both
types can be modified by the same set of adverbial/temporal modifiers:
?e no kerkar nyapge dali/?abra nyap no kerkar bark-i 'He is just recently thirsty.'
?e emetu nyap-ge daw-i/?abra nyap emetu bark-i 'He was already thirsty.'
?'He is always thirsty.'","[197, 198]"

"4.      Ethnographic Notes.
        Mer can only be described as a tropical paradise with swaying palms and
deep crystal-blue coral sea. The two islands dose-by to Mer are the islands of
Dawar and Wayer, to which people often travel on the weekends in order to get
away from the 'hustle and bustle' of the main island (see map on p. v). These
islands are said to have been created when the wind blew up the nostrils of a
mythological ancestor, Gilam, who then sneezed, throwing two seeds into the
water which then became the islands. Gilam travelled across from M6wa Island
inside the shape of a dugong which he had carved from wood in a desperate
attempt to get away from his mother! When he came to Mer, he lay down on
what became the hill of Gilam, flicked the left flipper of the dugong>which was
filled with food>and created a rich and productive soil found especially on the
eastern side of the island.
        The fertile volcanic soil and dense coral reef surrounding the islands
provide the people of Mer with ample food supplies such as fish, sardines, turtles
and many different types of yams, cassava, bananas, coconuts, mangoes, pawpaws,
bellfruit, wild almonds and countless others.
        The people are Melanesian with their own distinctive language and culture
although there have been, and continue to be) strong influences from contact with
other Torres Strait Islanders, Europeans, South Pacific Islanders (at least in former
times), and many other peoples. In the late nineteenth century, Europeans
became interested in the area for evangelistic reasons and for commercial reasons
as it is rich in marine resources. The widespread effects of this contact on the
culture and langu.age are evidenced, for example, in songs and dances. Meryam
people, however, pride themselves on their retention of the original songs and
dances of Mer which they appropriately call kab-kar 'true dance' (lit: dance-
intensifier).
        Ceremonies, both religious and secular, draw people together at various
times of the year, especially around Christmas when many people return home
 to see family and friends. There will be feasts, singing and dancing sometimes
lasting all through the night for several consecutive evenings. At such times,
 two groups of dancers will playfully compete with each other as to who can dance
 the best and the longest. The two groups are named after two clan names, Peybri
 and K6met, although members are not exclusively from these clans.
        Island life appears idyllic but there are pressures exerted on the community.
 These come from family and community who have a strong desire to develop
                                                                              4

pattern:

"1.4   The Syllable.
       The syllable remains inadequately defined in linguistics. Attempts have
been made to<cllTelate it with acoustic and physical properties such as a chest
pulse (Ladefoged, 1975; 220) or by asking the speaker (Ibid; 218). Other attempts
have focussed on the different types found within the phonological or
phonotactic system appealing to features such as onset, nucleus and coda
(Clements and Keyser, 1983; 11) as well as rules generating a set of possible syllabic
types for any given language (Kahn, 1980; 39). None of these approaches prove to
be entirely satisfactory when attempting to isolate just what is a syllable in a
given language.",[29]

                                                                          90
        The intransitive/plurals marker must occur in that particular slot in the
verb structure as there are examples where the initial CV of the verb root is
deleted and replaced by this marker. For example, dikmerik 'put Sg/DualO
resting upon something'--> ba-kmerik 'Sg/DualS rest upon something'; dasmer
'look'---> ba-smer 'look at oneself'.
        In order to account for the co-occurrence of the 1st person future prefix and
the intransitive/plurals marker, the future prefix na- has to be stated twice, in the
verb root slot(1) and in a prefix position (slot 2).
•       The 1st person future and 1 /2 person associated number morphemes can be
distinguished from each other on the basis of their different allomorphs. The 1st
person future morpheme has the allomorph -a- used with transitive verbs. The
1/2 person associated number morpheme has no allomorph -a- since the initial
consonant plus vowel of the verb root are always deleted when this marker is
prefixed. Examples are:
(3.40) ka abi d-a-            tagr-e
          1SgA 3Sg0 1-Futl-1 tell- Futl
          'I will tell him.'
(3.41) ka        marl na-     tagr-i kikem
          1SgA 2Sg01/2Sg0-tell-Pf after
          'I told you first.'
 •      Although the 1/2 person associated morpheme and the 3rd person
associated morpheme are homophonous, i.e. na-, their occurrence in the verb
structure differs. The 3rd person associated morpheme is an infix whereas the
1/2 person associated morpheme is a prefix. To illustrate this difference consider
the contrastive examples:
 (3.42) ma kari ta- ra-              tager-o       Umar-ge
          2SgA 1Sg0 Deix-1/2Sg0-tell- Fut2/3 U.- Loe
          'Tell me over there at Umar.'
 (3.43) ma yabi           ta- da-ra-       tager-o
          2SgA 3n SgO Deix-1 -3n SgO- I tell- Fut2/3
          'Tell the two of them over there.'
 (Note that the verb root detager 'tell' becomes I da-tager I when there is an infix.)
         When the 1 /2 person associated morpheme is affixed, the initial CV of the
 verb root is deleted and the prefix na- (-ra-) is affixed whereas when the 3rd
 person associated morpheme is affixed, it is infixed following the initial CV of the
 verb root. Consequently, the two morphemes are homophonous in form but
 distinct in function and placement.
 •         For other homophonous morphemes, they can be distinguished from one
 another because they are in fact co-occurring morphemes. For example, the past
 irrealis and remote past marker involve the same prefix morpheme as 3rd person
 future but not the same suffix morpheme:                                                                             91

"2.1    Parts of Speech.
       The following parts of speech need to be distinguished:
Nouns
Verbs
Adjectives
Pronouns
Adverbs
Deictic Markers
Clause Relators
Exclamations/InterjectionsNouns.
        Nouns are an open word class including both concrete or abstract nouns.
Concepts such as hunger, thirst, fatness and width are expressed in the language
as nouns; for example, 6mar 'good feeling', weku 'anger', werer 'hunger', nyap
'thirst', dob 'fatness', deg 'width', piri 'height', new 'ripeness, blister', kiris
'rawness'. This class of words is inflected for case through suffixes. Within this
class, a distinction needs to be drawn between common nouns, which inflect by
distinguishing A from S/O,and proper nouns, which inflect differently for all
three cases. There are many compound nouns formed with either two nouns,
e.g. kerim le 'boss' (kerim 'head' and le 'person'), or a nominalized verb and
noun, e.g. aro+aro tup 'sardines' (< ero 'eat'+ tup 'sardine').",[40]
"                                                                        128
(i.e. It is underlyingly a d-d sequence with deletion, or the cross-reference marker
is absent altogether and it is the pronominal form only which is providing
number information.)
         The number of inanimate objects can always be expressed through
independent lexical modifiers:
(3.188) ka able kep+kep lar digwat-                               i
           1SgA Det few Adj fishO pull in from sea Pauc/PIA/0-Pf

           'I caught those few fish.'
         Such choices are no doubt pragmatically determined and a larger corpus of
data will reveal what are the factors.","[139, 140]"
"2.4    Adjectives.
       The class of adjectives is somewhat problematic in terms of isolating its
members and determining what are its characteristics. The following words are
tentatively classed as adjectives: aw 'big, old', kebi 'little, young', debe 'good',
adud 'bad'. Also included in the adjective word class are the determiner/
demonstrative and quantifier words: able-ale 'determiner I demonstrative', netat
'one', nerut 'another', neys 'two', kep+kep 'few', wader 'several', mitkar 'alot',
gayr 'many'.
       Criteria used for determining class membership is not based so much on
what they are as on what they are not. These words typically occur in a modifier
function (although they sometimes can occur as nouns). All words functioning
as adjectives precede the noun they modify or directly precede the existential/
locational verb:                                                                            75
(2.278) able kebi werem i ezo- Ii

(2.279) debe lag+lag

        'Nice flavour.'
(2.280) debe le
        good person
        'Good one!'
(2.281) wader koskir
        several (married)female
        'several women'
(2.282) nole ko        adud ike
        Neg again bad n PIS be(thing)
         'It does not matter.'
         (lit: it is not bad (here) either)
       Examples have been collected where adjectives are being used with a degree
function:
(2.283) e        aw-kaka kebi werem da-                    Ii
        3SgS big-Intens little child n PIS be(person)-Primpf
         'He is a very small child.'
       In the above example, aw 'big' is not functioning as an adjective but as a
modifier of the adjective kebi 'little' to intensify it. (It would be pertinent to see
whether it can occur without the intensifier, e.g. ?e aw kebi werem dfili 'He is
slightly younger.')
       In the two examples below (2.284 and 2.285), the reduplicated form is being
used with a distributive function:
(2.284) wi          netat+netat taba agud-em erer ba- kri-        er
         3n SgS one              3Gen god-. All shout PIS-cry out-n Prlmpf

         'The sailors said to each other.. .'
(Both of the above examples are from the manuscript of a biblical translation of
Jonah.)
       Most words functioning as adjectives are derived from the noun word class
through a process of reduplication. Using Dixon's semantic types of adjectives
(1982), the following words in adjective function occur:
                                                                              76

                                     ex. tewpay-em 'for a short while'

5) age:
        peret 'old (of thing)'        <?emeret 'ancient time'
6) value:
       sek+sek 'bad'                   <?sek 'badness'
       sikak 'okay, well'             <sek 'badness' + kak 'privative'?
       parko+parko 'imperfect'        <parko 'defect'
7) speed:
        dudum+dudum 'quick'           <dudum 'haste'
       korider+korider 'fast'         <korider 'speed'
       wapum+wapum 'slow'             <?wapum 'slowness'
       Several items functioning as adjectives are homophonous in form with
nouns. Should these simply be labelled 'nominals'? In such cases, there is no
morphological or syntactic evidence to suggest that there is any derivation
involved and thus, there is no justification for two word classes.
       It remains to be checked whether the reduplicated form is possible at all
and/ or whether it intensifies its meaning:
?e tewpay+tewpay le 'he (is) a very short person'                                                                           77
?peret+peret wali 'very old clothes'
       There are also some examples where the adjective can occur either
reduplicated or not (see also section on comparison with nominal compounds
p65):
(2.286) urweri ni
         heat      water
         'hot water, tea'
(2.287) aw-kaka urweri+urweri gerger pe ike
         big-Intens heat Adj          dayS Deix n PIS be(thing)
         'It is a really hot day today.'
(2.288) ...a ba- ker-              i nar- lam beber lu       erep-        da
         Conj PlS-Pauc/PlS do-Pf boat-Abl heavy thingO grab Pauc/Pl0-P£Pl

         out-All throw Pauc/Pl0-P£Pl
         '... and they started grabbing the heavy things and throwing them
         overboard.'
         (from the manuscript of the bible translation of Jonah)
(2.289) aw beber+beber werem da-                     Ii
         big heavy Adj childS n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'He is a very heavy child.'
        The reader can note that the reduplicated form is associated with an
intensified meaning. It is not possible to say whether this meaning is obtained
from an adverbial function or a meaning that can be attributed to the
reduplicated form of the adjective. As this hypothesis was not considered during
fieldwork, no examples have been elicited to test it. The reduplicated form needs
to be tested for an attenuative meaning as well. The examples demonstrate the
possibility that reduplication can also be a semantic device.
        Rigsby (p.c) suggests that the reduplicated form has a proprietive meaning
and gives as an example:
(2.290) tulik+tulik le
         knife         person
         'person with a knife'
        No such examples were collected with the current corpus of data so no
comment can be made. However, there are examples where the associative case
has a proprietive meaning:
(2.291) mir- kem le
         word-Ass person
          'preacher' (lit: word-having person) (cf. 2.129)
 (2.292) ged- kem le
         land-Ass person
          'land owner' (lit: land-having person) (cf. 2.130)                                                                          78
      Of course, it may be that reduplication and the use of the associative suffix
have a general proprietive meaning with slight semantic differences between the
two.
       There is one example in the data where a proprietive meaning is the only
interpretation possible and yet there is no reduplicated form nor the presence of
the associative suffix:
(2.293) ese ka no
         if lSgS Restr
         aw bakir le        wa-       n(a)-        a-               Ii...
         big stone person RemPast-1/2Sg/PlS-n PIS be(person)-Prlmpf
         'H only I had had a lot of money.. .'
       It would seem on the basis of the above example that a proprietive
meaning cannot be the sole function of the reduplicated form.
       Some words always occur in a reduplicated form when functioning as
adjectives. Such is the case with colour terms, e.g. bam+bam 'yellow', where
reduplication is a signal of its function, i.e. a syntactic device, to mark a
derivational process. The two uses of reduplication are not necessarily
incompatible and there may be instances where syntactic uses and semantics
converge. More data will have to be collected to test such a claim.
       Is there a basis for postulating a distinct word class of adjectives? For at
least a small closed class of words whose function is primarily to modify nouns,
an adjective category is appropriate. For other words operating in this function,
one can simply specify that they are nominals which for some will be
reduplicated to mark their adjectival function and for others, to mark intensity.","[86, 87, 88, 89, 90]"

(This is the only verb collected beginning with /u/ and it sometimes occurs as
[wa-wrid] i.e. the /y/ glide is being labialized as a result of the back, high vowel

/wa/.)

       An interesting feature of the allomorphic variations of wa- and na- is the
interaction between phonological and syntactically-motivated rules; i.e. with wa-,
the front vowel of a transitive verb is reduced to a glide before the prefix like the
accented vowel of an intransitive verb (See the allomorphs of accented vowels
presented in the section on the verb structure p92). In contrast, an intransitive
verb with a front unaccented vowel is not reduced to a glide.","[122, 123]"

"Number Markers for 0 by Suffixes.
       The previous section discussed how suffixes cross-reference A and S
arguments of telic verbs. However, these markers can also cross-reference 0
arguments provided these do not conflict with the number hierarchy which can
be very broadly summarized as Pauc/PlA/O > Sg/DualA/O; that is paucal or
plural number 0 arguments can take precedence in the number suffix slot over
singular or dual A arguments. In other words, we find examples of Pauc/PlO
animates being marked by suffixes when there 'are 5~/D~l A an;mates:

         (DualO>non SingularA)
       Several possibilities can be suggested to account for these. This use may
reflect changes happening in the language such as that documented by
McConvell (1983; 26) who notes that there is 'loss of the trial/plural number
distinction intransitives' amongst speakers under about forty years old and so,
the number hierarchy is sometimes not applied. (This is less likely to be the
reason given that both of these utterances were by speakers in their fifties and
above.) It may be that such features are more sensitive to pragmatic features or
that indefiniteness in number for A is tolerated when its number and identity
have been clearly established elsewhere. A larger corpus of data monitoring these
factors would be desirable.
       In addition, the number hierarchy needs to be explored with respect to di-
transitive verbs where there are potentially two O's competing for cross-reference
marking in the suffix slot. It can be tentatively stated that when this is the case,
the animate 0 will take precedence over the inanimate 0:
(3.218) peybri le-          gize komet le        nam na-        kwar-           da

          'The 'peybri' clan members gave the 'komet' clan members, a turtle.'
 (The above example is interesting as it also illustrates how overt lexical number
marking for A will permit the cross-reference marking on the verb to include
number of A and 0.)
       Although the hierarchy for animates over inanimates sugges1sa loss of
information for number of 0, the reader is reminded that forms of the verb roots
 themselves often carry such information:
                                                                           133

               There is a closed class of markers grouped together on a semantic basis as
        their meaning is dependent and relative to a place, time, referent or proposition.
        They can be regarded as deictic markers because they are 'aspects of the
        interpretation of sentences that relate to the speech act situation' (Fillmore, 1975;
        8). In Meryam Mir, this is reflected in the choice of marker being determined by
        the time at which the event or state happens or is happening relative to the time
        of the speech act itself.
               It is unclear whether the deictic markers are words or not. They may or may
        not carry an accent. Their distribution in the sentence is equally unclear. They
        always follow the first element in a sentence and they nearly always occur before
        the verb in a clause. They never occur in isolation but always in conjunction
        with a verb which suggests they do not have independent grammatical status. In
        most examples, the deictic markers can be omitted without altering the
        grammatical status although there is obviously a change in meaning. Thus, the
        main functional load is on their meaning rather than their syntactic role.
               Their status and grammatical function will be discussed following a
        description of their forms, features and pragmatic/semantic function. However,
        several points should be made before the description:
        (i) Examples have been drawn mainly from texts or casual conversation as
        elicitation proved to be unsuccessful though desirable for testing certain claims.
        One of the consequences of such an approach is that there are major gaps in the
        data and not all meanings are contrasted.
        (ii) The glosses and free translations reflect the analysis of the researcher rather
        than informants' translations as they rarely gave any translation for the markers
        other than a spatial meaning and in some of the examples, such a translation was
         clearly inadequate.
         (iii) A number of features are given for each deictic marker which may prove in
.. ,I
  I     the light of further research to be irrelevant in establishing the contrast between
         them. Nonetheless these features have been included to make the treatment of
         each marker as extensive as possible.
         (iv) There is variation amongst speakers as to the appropriate or suitable marker
         to be used. Some speakers actually 'correct' the form of the marker used by
         another speaker, which suggests the deictic system is in a state of flux. Speakers
         do have choices depending on the perspective they wish to take and particular
         features which determine the choice of marker for one speaker may not be the                                                                                   146
     same prominent features which determine the choice for another speaker. In
     other words, a certain amount of variation within the system may be the result of
     ongoing changes.
     (v) The analysis presented below is by no means final but represents a working
     hypothesis based on the current corpus of data. Further study in the area may
     result in considerable changes.","[156, 157, 158]"
"        When temporal/aspectual/mood/number markers commencing with a
vowel other than /i/ are suffixed to verb roots ending in a high, front vowel /i/,
the root vowel is either reduced to a palatal glide /y/ under certain conditions or
is itself suffixed by a palatal glide when there is a suffix:

(When the accent is not overtly marked, the reader must assume that it occurs on
the second syllable.)
      The rules predicting the forms must be ordered and the second rule
                                                                           102
(i.e. i ---> iy) must follow the first. What is being represented is the general rule
that /i/ is reduced to a palatal glide when a morpheme is added. This is similar
to other vowel reductions to glides when there is affixation of a morpheme
commencing with a vowel. There are three environments where it does not
apply and there is an epenthetic glide so that the vowel can retain its syllabicity. It
is blocked when a consonant duster precedes the vowel (CC - + V[-i] ), when the
morpheme added is non-monosyllabic (- + V[-i] C V) and when the vowel is
unaccented (- [-accent] +V[iJ). Note that the apparent free variations in the 1st
person future form ot iti are probably to do with a desire in the production
process to keep the morpheme in a distinct syllable to that of the root.","[113, 114]"
"Adjectives.
       Adjectives are essentially a closed class. These include: aw 'big', kebi 'little,
young', debe 'good', adud 'bad'. Also included in this class are determiners and
quantifier words such as netat 'one', neys 'two', kep+kep 'few', wader 'several',
mitkar 'alot', gayr 'many'. As these items are the most representative of
adjectives cross-linguistically, it seems plausible that these are the basic adjectives
with others being derived from nouns or verbs. Words which function as
adjectives modify a noun in some way or are used attributively in a predicative
construction. Their position in the sentence is either before the noun which they
modif)j or preceding an existential verb when they are used with an ascriptive
function.",[41]

       is used for a temporal effect or to focus on a different referent.)

(An important point to note from the above example is the use of 3rd person
singular pronoun in the second clause: e-ge ... which does not in fact correlate
with the S/ A of the verb in terms of number, i.e. it is marking plural instead of
singular. One would expect to have a nonsingular pronoun. This might lead one
to suspect that it is not the pronoun being marked by the deictic but the event,
clause or even the whole proposition. More about this will be said shortly.)
      The use of the deictic markers to focus or contrast referents is further
exploited to introduce a clause that makes the referent specific, i.e. it is used as a
kind of restrictive relative clause marker. It would be premature to label such
constructions as restrictive relative clauses without having undertaken a full
                                                                            156

focussing on specific referents but rather on whole propositions.1 either in the form
of a single predicate proposition or of a multi-predicate proposition.

         (Dewmer, p212, section18)6)     pe, ge - logical relation
       Many of the instances of deictic markers serving to focus on referents or
propositions involve a relation of logical dependency. This logical relation might
be, at the very least, a temporal relation marking a sequence or partial overlap
between one proposition and the previous one (such as in the t.lCatortes quoted
above) but sometimes it indicates a result/ consequence:

     It may be that the logical relationship established between two referents or
propositions is the result of inference and not part of the meaning proper of the
deictic markers themselves. This is an area requiring further investigation.4.2.3 pa,ga1)    pa - relative to present time/ space; ga - relative to nonpresent time/ space
      The same temporal distinctions as pe and ge serve to contrast the related
deictic markers pa and ga which can both be defined roughly as having the same
referent or event/state as a previous proposition. The difference between pa and
ga lies in their temporal reference. Pa is restricted to the present, ga to the
nonpresent as defined earlier. Note that the marker pa can include states which
began earlier than the day of the speech act and remain current at the time of the
speech act utterance. The following examples illustrate the time distinctions:

       The reason for the ungrammatical sentence given above is that the present
deictic marker pa conflicts in its temporal reference with the future event.
       An example where the present deictic marker is suitable follows:

"       There are several lexical items where the front vowels /i, e/ appear to be in
free alternation in unstressed position. This may be that there is some variation
in their realisation when they do not contrast and consequently there is no risk of
confusion. Hence, the varying orthography between Meryarn and Miryam.
Consider also:
       omaskir- omasker 'children'
       rnikir-mekir 'almond tree""
       kirim-kerim 'head'
       kila(r)+kila(r) 'strong'; kelar 'strength'
       gilar-gelar 'law'
       Nonetheless, one would not want to consider these as a single phoneme as
there are minimal pairs where they do contrast:
       gim'illness'                gem'body'
       mir 'word, language'        Mer 'Murray Island'
       wit 'wrong-doing'           wet 'instrument used for skinning coconuts'                                                                            15
      Ii 'faeces'               le 'person'
Furthermore, even when these are unaccented they can contrast:
      etkir 'undress Plclothes' itkir 'rub off'
      etrum 'come down'         itrum 'bring down'
      emri 'sit down'           imri 'seat'1.3    Pitch-Accent
       Accent is distinctive in the language as words are contrasted according to
the particular syllable on which accent is placed. There are a number of minimal
pairs which contrast solely through accent placement. In the following examples,
the first set of disyllabic words have the accent on the first syllable whilst the
second, set have it on the second syllable:
                                                         ~      V-V                                             V-V
       tabo 'snake'                                    tab6 'neck'

       isi 'take out Pauc/PlO perf'                    isi 'centipede'
       bager 'type of spear'                           bader 'PlS land'
       What exactly is meant by 'accent'? There is no consensus amongst
linguists who have worked on the language as to what feature or bundle of
features mark the 'accent'. Bartos (1977) refers to the feature as 'stress' but fails to
characterize or define it. McConvell (1983) refers to it as 'pitch-accent' with the
accented syllable being the one carrying high tone/ stress on it. Rigsby (p.c)
maintains that an accented syllable may but need not have high tone.
        In the current corpus of data, isolated lexical items collected through
elicitation have the accented syllable bearing high pitch:
        6mar 'good feeling'              umar village name
        zyawali 'book'                   apkorep 'habit, manner'
        iperedi 'be lying'               imiredi 'be sitting Pr'
        dirsi 'be moored'                dirsir 'prepare'
        dobdob 'fat'                     kepkep 'few'
        datrum 'cut n PlO'               itrum 'bring down'
        However, when certain inflections or clitics are added or simply within
discourse, the accented syllable can shift place or the previous accent bearing
syllable will no longer carry high pitch:
ex.     le-      gize
        person-PIA
        'people (A)'
                                                                                16
      >Wayer pit         le -   gize
          place    point person-PIA
      [    - -                   - _]
      'people of Wayer point'
ex.   kirgir 'youth', makrem 'unmarried man'
      > kirgir makrem
      [              -]
      'male youth'
ex.   ereg 'eat flesh'
      >ka able lar irg-         i
       1SgA Det fishO eat flesh-Pf
      [    -                       -]
       'I ate the fish'
       Should the definition of accent be altered to include these alternations or
should the definition of accent remain correlated with high tone with details
given elsewhere as to its interaction with other features such as intonation? It
would seem more useful in a descriptive work to keep accent as a discrete
linguistic category specifying elsewhere the alternations.
       Accent placement is restricted to the first or second syllable of a
phonological word. Thus, in disyllabic or polysyllabic words, there is a fall in the
pitch following the accented syllable:
ex.    bakyamu
       [ - - -]
      'Go!'
ex.   e bakyamu-da
      [-   - - - -]
      '(He/she) went.'
ex.   wi bakyamu-daryey
      [-       -           -]
      'They (2) went.'
ex.   wi abi et6mert-idere
      [- ___ - - - __ ]        'They (few) showed him.'
       Note that the syllable in which the pitch falls from mid to low may be
significant. It could be signalling what is sometimes referred to as secondary
stress, i.e. high pitch = primary accent, falling pitch = secondary accent. Further
research is required in this area.
        It is not the case that the secondary accent corresponds to a morphological
boundary. For example:
                                                                             17
      bodomolam 'exchange, payment'
      [- -   -    ]
       (contrast with, for example, bakyamuda)
       There are several monosyllabic homophonous pairs whose accent
placement differs when an inflection is added. McConvell (1983) noted that the
lexical item pim 'finger, grasshopper' carried different accent placement when
the ergative inflection was added:
       pim-ide 'fingerA'
       pim-ide 'grasshopperA'
       McConvell also points out the difference in the vowel quality (1,1..). The
variations in accent placement cannot be the result of the vowel given similar
alternations in the accent placement when inflections are added with the item lag
'mosquito, smell':
       lag-ide 'smellA'
       U.g-ide 'mosquitoA'
       McConvell proposes a morphophonemic notation by transcribing those
items retaining accent placement on the root with the accent diacritic:
       U.g 'mosquito'              lag 'smell'
       pim 'grasshopper'           pim 'finger'
       This proposal seems more like a 'trick' than a solution as both types have
high pitch when there are no inflections:
ex.     debe U.g      pe dike
       good smells Deix n PIS be(name?)
        'That is a nice smell.'
ex.    ka able lag              as6- Ii
        lSgA Det mosquitoO hear-Preslmpf
        'I am listening to the mosquito.'
        The retention or loss of the root accent when suffixed by an inflection may
be due to an historical development.","[26, 27, 28, 29]"
"5.     Sociolinguistic Notes.
       A special form of the language is used for grieving or expressing sympathy
for an individual. This speech style is called nas+nas rnir 'sorry talk' (lit: sad Adj
word) and only affects verbs by either changing the first vowel to /o/ or /u/ or by
inserting a bilabial glide between the initial consonant and vowel; e.g. dali 'be
Primpf' ---> dwali 'be Prlmpf in sorry talk'; digern 'walk' ---> dogern 'walk in
sorry talk' (see the section in Phonology on glides p. 10).
       Whilst all Meryam speakers on Mer can talk some Creole, it is not the case
that all Creole speakers can talk Meryam. For this reason, community affairs are
generally conducted in Creole. For example, when council candidates were
giving their election speech during my stay, only one out of six candidates
delivered their speech in Meryam.
       Furthermore, even with Meryam speakers, there is code-switching
depending upon the topic and addressee. In the family home, parents often
address their children in Creole, switching to Meryam when they want to discuss
something which does not concern them. However, many younger people in
their twenties and below, only have a passive knowledge of Meryam and,
consequently, always converse in Creole. It is only speakers in their mid-thirties
and above, with a sufficient grasp of Meryam, who can converse in it.
       The language of education is English with Creole used informally in the
classroom for giving instructions or explaining difficult concepts. Meryam is
taught for only half an hour or an hour a week in the school and is funded by the
Commonwealth government.
       The Creole spoken on Mer (and on the other Eastern Islands, see Shnukal
1988) does have a high proportion of Meryam lexical items. Similarly, speakers of
Meryam also employ Creole words although the proportion may vary
enormously from speaker to speaker and topic to topic. There are sometimes
preferences for words from a particular language and meanings can differ from
one language to another. For example, the Creole kinship terms sisi 'sister' and
bala 'brother' are used far more frequently than the Meryam term berbet 'sibling'.
An example of semantic shift is the instance of two children from one family
who use Creole terms rnarni 'mummy' and dadi 'daddy' for their parents and the
Meryam terms am.a 'mother' and bab 'father' for their grandparents instead of
the Meryam term kayed or ata for 'grandparent'.
       Not all speakers of Meryam have the same command and knowledge of
the language and future research must aim at documenting the range and
differences in forms, functions and meanings comparing conservative Meryam
and Creole.",[16]
"Arguments for considering the glides as underlying consonants.
(i)    There are only sequences of vowel plus glides or glides plus vowels within
the one syllable. Other vowel sequences always occur over two syllables with a
glide intervening although it may not be very prominant, e.g. kayed
'grandparent', keyar 'crayfish', eyu 'type of grass', iyu 'tears Instr', Mowa 'island
name'. Phonotactically, the glide occurs in a position typically occupied by a
consonant and thus, could be regarded as part of the consonant system.
(ii)   With some lexemes, there are examples of two glides and a vowel within
the one syllable:
       syaw 'sneeze'
       bway 'kinspeople'
       way 'seed inside the coconut'
       yey 'large blind shark'
       waw 'yes, hole'
       If glides are analysed as underlying vowels, then an account must be made
in the phonotactics of a possible sequence of three vowels- a somewhat unusual
phenomenon amongst languages of the world. If, however, the glides are
analysed as underlying consonants, then a sequence eve can be hypothesized- a
pattern which can be found elsewhere in the language.
       The analysis of glides as consonants will still require further specification
in the phonotactic outline of the language because the only clusters that are
permitted word initially are those of a consonant plus glide type.
(iii)  Glides will have to be postulated to account for their use across morpheme
boundaries:
       tutu-em-tutuw-em 'type of doll-all'
       ,     ,
       1-u-1y-u   'tears-ms
                         • tr
                           I
       6+o-6w+o 'courageous' (lit: liver+liver)
       le-em-ley-em-le-m 'person-all'       The decision as to whether glides are part of the consonant system or part
of the vowel system cannot be made at this stage of the analysis. More data and
evidence needs to be collected. In this analysis, glides will be presented as part of
the consonant system although this is only tentative.",[24]

       Sometimes, the first nominal is not inflected although it must then always
directly precede the locational:

       There are two possible interpretations for this data. One can either regard
the inflected nominal as the head with the preposed nominal acting like a
modifier, or one could regard the whole phrase as a complex phrase with the case
suffixed to the postposition.
       Absent from the noun complex structure presented above is the
phenomenon of compounds which behave like a single complex head noun.
There is no syntactic dependency between the two nouns since modifiers affect
both parts of a complex head noun:
