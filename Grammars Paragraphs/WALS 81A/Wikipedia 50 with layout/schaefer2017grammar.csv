"Cultural and Linguistic BackgroundEmai is mother tongue for approximately 25,000–35,000 members of the Emai clan
in south central Nigeria. It is spoken in ten villages across roughly 250 square kilo-
meters on the plateau between the Edion and Owan rivers of present-day Edo State.
Located at longitude 6° east of Greenwich Meridian and latitude 7° north of the
equator, this area consists primarily of tree savanna, allowing for bush agriculture
involving the harvesting of yam, maize, cassava, and beans among other crops
(Bradbury 1957). Serving as the principal political village of the Emai is Afuze. Other
villages in the clan are Eteye, Evbiame-New-Site, Evbiame-Old-Site, Ogute, Ojavun-
New-Site, Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhunmi, Ovbionwu, and Uanhumi.
     The Emai-speaking region is approximately 120 kilometers north of Benin City
by road. It is connected in the south to Sabongida, the principal village of the relat-
ed Ora clan, in the east to Uzebba, the primary village of the related Iuleha clan, and
in the north to Auchi, the headquarters of the Edoid language Yekhee.
     As for the Emai people, oral tradition makes clear the absence of hereditary
chieftancy, a cultural feature frequent among Edoid peoples of its region. According
to oral tradition (Ogbomo 1994), the ancestor of the Emai people is Ima. He is said to
have fled from the ancient kingdom of Benin in about the 16th Century for commit-
ting murder. Ima and his wife, who also came from Benin, had a son Uzuanbi (Oyai-
bi). Uzuanbi, in turn, had two wives, Odidi and Oron, whose sons founded the Emai
speaking villages. Oral tradition varies at this point. According to one version, the
four sons of Uzuanbi and his wives were Uwuno, Urule, Ivbiame, and Uanhumi,
each of whom founded a village. Their sons, Uzuanbi's grandsons, founded the ten
quarters into which the four villages became divided. According to another version,
the village of Uanhumi is named after the son of one wife and the remaining villages
are related to three sons of a second wife. The sons were Uule, Evbiame and
Ovbionwu, whose names are retained, respectively, by the village sites of Ugbuule,
Evbiame-Old-Site, and Ovbionwu, all of which are located off the main Ora-Auchi
road and tend to be northernmost in their respective village groups. Each of these
villages serves to link the remaining Emai-speaking area. Villages in the Uule group,
from south to north, are: Ojavun-Old-Site, Okpokhumi, Eteye, Uanhumi, Afuze,
Ojavun-New-Site. Ugbuule no longer exists as an occupied village. The Evbiame
group from south to north consists of Evbiame-New-Site, Ogute, and Evbiame-Old-
Site. The Ovbionwu group consists solely of Ovbionwu.
     As a linguistic entity, Emai is completely surrounded by Edoid speech varieties.
Its genetic classification as a distinct linguistic unit within Edoid is of recent origin.
Elugbe (1973) classified it as part of a dialect cluster incorporating adjacent Ora
                                                                          Preface | ix(30,000 speakers) and Iuleha (45,000 speakers); Elugbe (1989) locates this cluster
more specifically within the North Central Branch of Edoid. While a word list sup-
porting a cluster relationship among these dialects was not published, broader clas-
sificatory schemes have accepted the cluster interpretation, e.g. Hansford, Bendor-
Samuel and Stanford (1976), Bendor-Samuel (1989) and Crozier and Blench (1992).
Even Christian missionary activity in the area has never generated word lists, since
neither the Bible nor a church hymnal is available in Emai.
     Linguistic investigation of individual languages within the Edoid group is ex-
tremely limited. Other than Emai, no descriptive grammatical treatment, encom-
passing reference grammar, lexicon, and texts, has appeared for a single member of
the 25 or more Edoid languages. Perhaps the most widely recognized comparative
and historical analysis of the Edoid group is Elugbe's (1973) unpublished disserta-
tion “A Comparative Edo Phonology” and its successor, Comparative Edoid: Phonol-
ogy and Lexicon (Elugbe 1989). Also showing an exclusive interest in phonological
matters is Elimelech's (1979) A Tonal Grammar of Etsako, which examines the role of
pitch differences in words and short phrases among dialects of Yekhee spoken
northeast of Emai country.
     Among other Edoid studies, Thomas (1910) presents a highly schematic gram-
matical and lexical analysis of Bini, the numerically and culturally dominant lan-
guage of the group since establishment of the influential Edo Kingdom in the 13th
Century (Ryder 1969). Later studies of Bini amplify portions of this initial analysis.
Melzian (1937) is a descriptive dictionary from which one can infer grammatical
information at the level of parts of speech, while Amayo (1976) and Wescott (1962)
offer accounts of Bini phonology and morphology. Several linguistic studies of Bini
in pedagogical or descriptive formats have followed. Dunn's (1968) An Introduction
to Bini is a training manual prepared for the American Peace Corps and as such
couches most of its language material in a limited variety of dialogue formats for the
prospective volunteer. An additional pedagogically oriented study is An Edo-English
Dictionary by Agheyisi (1986), which is intended for use in primary and secondary
schools. Stewart (1998) provides a theoretical interpretation of selected serial verb
constructions in Bini.
     Additional linguistic studies of Edoid speech varieties tend to be descriptive.
Ejele (1986) provides an overview of selected syntactic issues in Esan. Kari (1997)
provides a brief grammatical sketch of the Delta Edoid language Degema, which is
followed by a more detailed and illustrated descriptive grammar (2004).
     As for Emai, an initial lexicon and orthographic statement is offered by Schaefer
(1987), while Egbokhare (1990) presents an initial phonological analysis. An exten-
sive collection of Emai oral tradition texts is found in Oral Tradition Narratives of the
Emai People, Parts I and II (Schaefer and Egbokhare 1999b). This is complemented
more recently by A Dictionary of Emai: An Edoid Language of Nigeria (Schaefer and
Egbokhare 2007). Additional information on Emai is available in a number of papers
x | Prefaceby Schaefer and Egbokhare published in a variety of books and journal articles. Of
particular relevance to the future of Emai as a spoken medium is Schaefer and Eg-
bokhare (1999a), which found an intergenerational shift to English as home lan-
guage in the mid-1990s without a commensurate negative evaluation of vernacular
mother tongue.

Emai has no written tradition except as introduced in an initial orthographic state-
ment by Schaefer (1987) and utilized in the text collection of Schaefer and Egbo-
khare (1999) and a dictionary by Schaefer and Egbokhare (2007). To maintain some
consistency in discussion of linguistic issues in Emai, we follow the practice estab-
lished by these earlier works, although some changes regarding tone marking are
noted below. In general, segment representations follow conventions for Nigerian
languages set out in Williamson (1984) and adapted for Emai.","[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"

     Stop sounds occur at four places of articulation: bilabial, alveolar, velar, and
labiovelar. Fricatives articulate at four places: labiodental, alveolar, palatal and
velar. There are affricate sounds at only alveopalatal. Approximants appear at five
places of articulation: bilabial, alveolar, palatal, labiovelar and glottal. They show
allophonic relationships with nasal consonants at four places: bilabial, alveolar,
palatal and labiovelar. Alternation in three instances is conditioned by a nasal vow-
el (‘vb’~‘m,’ ‘w’~‘nw,’ and ‘y’~‘ny’) and in one instance by syntactic positioning
and/or syntactic category (‘l’~‘n’, Chapter 9, 9.1). The two approximants ‘h’ and ‘r’
fail to alternate with nasal consonants.
      In the following lexemes, stop sounds occur word initially.

Emai is a terraced-level tone language showing high, low, and down-stepped high.
For some word classes, inherent tone values distinguish words that in all other as-
pects of sound shape are identical. Nouns, adjectives and postverbal adverbs in
citation form express lexical meanings through tonal contrasts. Citation forms of
verbs, auxiliaries, and adverbial preverbs generally exhibit no tonal contrast, as
with other Edoid languages (Elugbe 1989). Emai verbs, auxiliaries, and preverbs are
assigned tone values reflecting grammatical properties of their constructions. In
large part these values correlate with the categories indicative and subjunctive
mood. More specifically, major patterns of tonal contrast derive from aspect (per-
fect, imperfect and prospective), modality (deontic and epistemic) and sentence
complement type.
     For Emai words composed of identical segments, predominantly nouns and ad-
verbs, tone values play a distinguishing role. Emai's high (H), down-stepped high
(!H) and low (L) tones combine in various ways within otherwise identical lexical
nouns, adjectives and postverbal adverbs. In orthographic practice, high tone is
                                   Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography | 5represented by an acute accent, low tone by a grave accent, and down-stepped high
by an acute accent immediately followed by a single quote. The last of these tones is
one pitch step lower than an immediately preceding high tone.ódòn                  òdón                   òkpá                   òkpà

‘vomit’                ‘fist’                ‘monkey’               ‘trickery’    Various combinations of tone occur within lexical items. An initial high tone
vowel immediately followed by a consonant can be followed by a low tone, a high
tone, or a down-stepped high.áwà [ H L ]                ónóì [ H H L ]                     éghó' [ H !H ]

‘house’                                 ‘basket’Downdrift () affects non-initial high tone, lowering the latter's pitch when preced-
ed by a low tone.ódùdú [ H L H ]                        íkèké [ H L H ]
‘shadow’                                ‘bicycle’1.4 Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography
Major word classes tend to reflect contrasting syllable structures, although no abso-
lute relation exists between category type and syllable character. All parts of speech
are vowel final. Nouns are uniformly vowel-initial. Verbs tend to be consonant ini-
tial, with a few being vowel initial. Adjectives are usually consonant initial, whereas
adverbs are either vowel- or consonant initial. Of the minor categories, some are
predominantly consonant initial with a few vowel initial forms (preverbs, postverbal
particles, complements). Other minor categories are vowel initial (determiners) with
a few consonant initial forms (intensifiers). The preposition class is consonant ini-
tial. Concord expression is vowel only with fixed tone patterns.
      In pronunciation, the syllabic character of word classes in phrasal or clausal
constructions is normally adjusted by one or another phonological process: vowel
6 | Orthography and grammatical overviewelision or glide formation. These processes lead to a divergence between the ortho-
graphic practice of employing citation forms and normal-rate pronunciation ren-
dered phonetically. Regardless of phonetic transformation through glide formation
or vowel elision, orthographic practice retains vowel segments in all word classes.
     Glide formation affects the close vowels [i] and [u] when they precede non-close
vowels within a lexical or syntactic constituent. These vowels alternate with the
glides [y] and [w], respectively, as illustrated by the verbs fi and ku when followed
by a noun phrase.fí    ópìà [fyópìà]                     kú    àmè [kwàmè]
throw cutlass                           throw water     Under specific grammatical conditions, the vowel elision process omits a mor-
pheme-final vowel. Elision differentially affects word classes, revealing complex
interactions between phonological and syntactic parameters. Vowel elision applica-
tion is restricted across major syntactic constituents like subject/predicate and pred-
icate/adverb. In normal pronunciation of the sentence below, neither the final vow-
el of the subject noun ókpósó ‘woman’ nor the initial vowel of the verb éhén
‘prepare’ elide. Similarly, neither the final vowel of the direct object ákhé ‘pot’ nor
the initial vowel of the adverb òdè ‘yesterday’ elide. However, the final vowel of the
predeterminer ólì ‘the’ elides, as does the final vowel of the verb éhén.ólí ókpósó éhén'        ákhé òdè. [ólókpósó éhán'khé òdè]
the woman PAP.prepare pot yesterday
‘The woman prepared a pot yesterday.’Vowels juxtaposed due to discourse repositioning of constituents are not elided. The
final vowel of noun áwà ‘dog,’ when in clause-initial topic position, is not omitted
relative to the initial vowel of following élì ‘the.’ólí áwà, élí ímòhè khú            óì. [óláwà élímòhè khú óì]
the dog the men PRP.chase it
‘As for the dog, the men chased it.’    Vowel elision in pronunciation reflects three phonetic patterns that become
transparent most easily with transitive verb phrases. When a lexical direct object
immediately follows a consonant initial verb with a single vowel, the final vowel of
the verb is omitted, while the initial vowel of the direct object is retained. Ortho-
graphic representation shows both vowels nonetheless, as shown by comparing
orthographic representations to square bracketed broad phonetic representations.
                                   Syllable structure, pronunciation and orthography | 7gbé áwà [gbáwà]                         dé óràn       [dóràn]
kill dog                                buy woodVerbs defined by a single nasal vowel reflect a second pattern. In pronunciation, the
vowel itself is omitted but its nasal quality is retained and assumed by the initial
vowel of the ensuing noun phrase. Again, phonetic and orthographic representa-
tions diverge.sén áwà [sánwà]                         tón ímòhè [tínmòhè]
stab dog                                bury menStill a third phonetic pattern is exhibited by verbs with a sequence of identical vow-
els (koo ‘read’). In pronunciation, the sequence shortens when a lexical direct object
follows; it does not elide entirely. Comparison to a single vowel verb (ko ‘plait’)
illustrates the contrast. Orthographic presentation of each verb is consistent with its
citation form.kóó ébè [kóébè]                         kó    émà [kémà]
read book                               plant yamLastly, verb final vowels do not elide when followed by a pronominal direct object.sá óì [sáóì]                            gbé óì [gbéóì]
fetch it                                kill it     Orthographic and broad phonetic representations exhibit varying degrees of
congruency in the case of word formation. Since both vowel elision and glide for-
mation are evident in the pronunciation of compounds and nominalizations, identi-
fication of morpheme elements is often obscured by vowel omission. To maintain
some level of morpheme transparency in orthographic practice, elided vowels in
compounds and nominalizations are accounted for in two ways.
     Nominalized word forms in pronunciation exhibit no major incongruency rela-
tive to orthographic practice. Nouns derived from a verb by prefix addition, show no
vowel elision.àòó ‘thought’                           oo ‘to think’
èkpà ‘vomit’                            kpa ‘to vomit’Compound forms, however, pose potential problems for orthographic practice.
Vowels at word boundaries within compounds are subject to elision. When the verb
in a verb-noun compound is transitive (e.g. ze ‘scrape,’ da ‘drink’), its single vowel
8 | Orthography and grammatical overviewis elided. Comparison of forms for ‘barber’ and ‘drunkard’ reveal how only the
sound shapes of prefix and noun, but not verb, are consistent across broad phonetic
form and orthographic practice.òzètò    [ò-ze-étò]                     òdènyò    [ò-da-ényò]
‘barber’ prefix-scrape-hair             ‘drunkard’ prefix-drink-wineElision also affects nasal vowels in verb-noun compounds but not in the manner
evident in syntactic constructions. Whereas only the vowel of a verb is elided in
syntactic phrases, both the vowel and its nasal quality (e.g. ken ‘divide’ and kpen ‘be
next to’) tend to be effaced in compounds.ákèvà          [á-ken-èvá]              ókpòkhúnmí [ó-kpen-òkhùnmì]
‘twin kernels’ prefix-divide-two        ‘upward’    prefix-be.next.to-topIn compounds, non-nasal vowels elide and are not rendered orthographically. In
noun-noun compounds, orthographic practice and broad phonetic rendering align,
except for the final vowel of the compound’s left constituent.ákòísí' [àkò     òísí']                 ákùhàì [àkò     ùhàì]
‘holster’ sheath gun                    ‘quiver’ sheath arrow    Elision is also evident in word formation involving reduplication. Forms refer-
ring to relationships of time and space involve reduplication of an entire root (e.g.
ésè ‘center of’ and édè ‘day’), with accompanying elision of the initial constituent’s
morpheme-final vowel. Orthographic practice shows the vowel as elided.ésèsé     [ésè-ésè]                     èdèdé    [édè-édè]
‘direct center of’                      ‘moments ago’
ésè                                     édè
‘center of’                             ‘day’    Pronunciation of phrasal compounds also reflects glide formation. The final
close vowels of augmentative údù and diminutive úvbì, when preceding a vowel,
assume a glide shape. Orthographic practice retains the corresponding vowel.údú émà [údwémà]                        úvbì àfàn [úvbyàfàn]
AUG yam                                 DIM harp

1.5 Basic sentence types and pitch register
Basic grammatical relations in Emai show the order Subject-Verb-Object (SVO).
Declarative statements with transitive verbs reveal a subject noun phrase (ólí ómòhè
‘the man’) followed by a verb (é ‘eat’) and its direct object (ólí émàè ‘the food’).(1) ólí ómòhè é         ólí émàè.
    the man PRP.eat the food
    ‘The man has eaten the food.’Sentence types contrast with respect to voice-register and tonal pattern. Imperative
constructions utilize a normal voice register.(2) è ólí émàè.
    eat the food
    ‘Eat the food.’Declaratives rely on a normal voice register as well.(3) ólí ómòhè é         ólí émàè.
    the man PRP.eat the food
    ‘The man has eaten the food.’However, polar interrogatives (yes/no questions), while manifesting the same word
order as declaratives and essentially the same tonal patterns, employ a higher pitch
register.(4) ólí ómòhè é         ólí émàè?
    the man PRP.eat the food
    ‘Has the man eaten the food?’Rhetorical questions are also expressed through this higher register, adding a final
extra-high tone (e.g. é) to a lexical low tone (émàè).(5) ólí ómòhè ò ó è ólí émàèé?
    the man SC C eat the food
    ‘The man is eating the food, is he?’
10 | Orthography and grammatical overview1.6 Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution
Tonal configurations in Emai reveal the interaction of lexical tone with syntactic
tone values derived from grammatical categories and their placement. Traditional
phrase heads such as nouns and verbs exhibit tonal variability controlled by pres-
ence or absence of modifying constituents or of adjacent phrases. For purposes of
illustration, we rely on noun phrases and monotransitive or ditransitive verb
phrases to convey an overview of the nature of this variability, although a full ac-
count of principles underlying sentence, clause and phrase tone remains to be un-
dertaken.","[29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"

     Temporal coincidence with bíì phrases does not correspond to verbs in series.(i) a. *ó víé'        húá ìwàwà.
        she PAP.cry take pots
        ‘She cried and carried pots.’
    b. *ó húá'         ìwàwà víé.

  Matrix clauses in causal circumstance accept manner-demonstrative preverbs ìyó and ìná. They
are interpreted as coreferential with the subordinate circumstantial clause; they are manner
proforms with subordinate clause as antecedent. Nonetheless, ìyó and ìná do not exhibit parallel
distribution. Each occurs in focus position relative to a matrix clause, thereby immediately follow-
ing its antecedent circumstantial clause, which itself occurs in topic position. Constructions with
manner proforms in focus position require Manner preverb i in the matrix clause.(i) a. ébé' òhí í'          gbé ólí éwè, ìyó lí ó í'                   é óí ògbòn.
       as Ohi PAP.MAN kill the goat DMD PF he PAP.MAN eat it raw

           PMD PF you PRED MAN take it APP me
      ‘Since this morsel of yam is very fresh now, it is this way you will give it to me.’In other constructions, ìyó appears in matrix clause preverb position; ìná does not.

         as he PAP.MAN take wood he PAP.PMD enter LOC house
          ‘Since he carried wood, he in this way entered the house.’Manner-demonstrative adverbials do not occur in postverbal position in the matrix clause of a
circumstantial construction.(iii) a. *ébé' ó í'            húá éràn, ó ó'           vbí íwé ìyó.

          as he PAP.MAN take wood he PAP.enter LOC house PMD
          ‘Since he carried the wood, he entered the house this way.’19
   Unlike ébé'/ébí', élàbé/élàbí does not participate in temporal coincidence of circumstance con-
structions framed by Punctual aspectualizer ghe.(i) a. ébé' ó ghé'         ì     dá    ólí ényò léé,     òhí vá'rè.
       as he PAP.PCT MAN drink the wine TEMP Ohi PAP.come

        as     he PAP.PCT MAN drink the wine TEMP Ohi PAP.come
        ‘Just as he finished drinking the wine, Ohi came.’20
  Aside from circumstantial extent, se is found in three other constructions (Chapter 6, 6.1.6, Chap-
ter 7, 7.5.2.3, and Chapter 11, 11.3). As a verb with a locative complement, it designates directional
motion.(i) ò sé                     vbì ìwè.
    he PRP.move.as.far.as LOC house
    ‘He moved as far as the house.’As a verb in series and with an optional complement, se specifies that an event is sufficient relative
to cultural norms. (Chapter 11, 11.6.1)(ii) a. ò dá         ényò sé.
        he PRP.drink wine be.sufficient
        ‘He drank enough wine. / He drank wine to a sufficient extent.’
     b. ò dá          ényò sé       vbí ékò.
        he PRP.drink wine reach LOC limit
        ‘He drank wine to the limit.’The verb se is also found as an obligatory constituent in questions of extent, where it combines with
ébé'/ébí' and Manner preverb i. Such questions invite responses with quantity preverb zemi.
                                                                                 Endnotes | 963
(iii) a. ébé' ó í'         dá    ényò sé?  > ò zémì        dá      ényò.
         how he PAP.MAN drink wine reach     he PRP.ABSI drink wine
         ‘How much wine did he drink?’       ‘He drank a lot of wine.’
      b. ébé' ó í'        móé útòtómì sé? > ò zémì          mòè útòtómì.
         how he PAP.MAN have strength reach he PRP.ABSI have strength
         ‘How much strength does he have?’   ‘He has a lot of strength.’21
  Matrix clauses in extent constructions accept manner-demonstrative ìyó, not ìná as proforms.
Antecedents for ìyó occur as subordinate circumstantial extent clauses.(i) ébé' í í'           móé étìn        sé,
    as I PAP.MAN have strength reach
       í gbó'        ìyó' / *íná' ré óì vbíéé óì.
       I PAP.ADD DMD PMD use it show him
    ‘Since I have such strength, I also that way used it to show him too.’Maintaining the same discourse function, manner-demonstrative ìyó also appears in focus position
relative to a matrix clause, thereby allowing ìyó to immediately follow the subordinate extent
clause.(ii) ébé' í í'          móé étìn         sé,     ìyó lí í gbó'         ì     ré óì vbíéé óì.
     as I PAP.MAN have strength reach DMD PF I PAP.ADD MAN use it show him
     ‘Since I have such strength, so it is that I also used it to show him too.’22
  Information in matrix clauses linked to extent clauses is queried by questions framed by
ébé'/ébí'...i...se that convey erstwhile subordinate clause information. Responses require normative
extent se, its vbi phrase and its extraposed khi complement expressing the erstwhile matrix clause
proposition.(i) ébé' ó í'            é émàè sé?
    how she PAP.MAN eat food reach
    ‘How much food did she eat?’
    ó é'          émàè sé      vbì ò khí ó ì         ké   mìtí fì étìn.
    she PAP.eat food reach LOC it IND she NEG ANT able blow breath
    ‘She ate food until she was not able to breathe anymore.’23
  As with S-complement subjunctives (Chapter 13, 13.2.4), purposive li…í clauses show a unique
pattern vis-à-vis modality marking and grammatical subject shape. With pronominal subjects, li
clauses show deontic Hortative i. With lexical subjects, li clauses reveal no overt Hortative.(i) a. ò sá         àmè lí        yán í      kpè dé ényò ní áìn.
       he PRP.fetch water SUBJ they HOR SUB buy wine APP him
       ‘He fetched water in order that the women still buy wine for him.’

       he PRP.fetch water SUBJ the women HOR SUB buy wine APP him
       ‘He fetched water in order that the women still buy wine for him.’

  As a complementizer, li marks embedded subjunctive S-complements with right edge high tone
subjects and either covert or overt Hortative í.(i) a. ólí ókpósó ré'         é lí     ólí ómóhé dè ólí émà.
       the woman PAP.CONC say SUBJ the man buy the yam
       ‘The woman said that the man should buy the yam.’

       the woman PAP.CONC say SUBJ they HOR buy the yam
       ‘The woman said that they should buy the yam.’Aside from multi-clause structures, li serves three functions in complex predicates. As outlined in
Chapter 9, 9.1, li codes recipient, beneficiary or addressee.(ii) a. ólí ókpósó nwú'        ényò lí  ólí ómóhé òdè.
        the woman PAP.take wine APP the man yesterday
        ‘The woman gave wine to the man yesterday.’

        the man PAP.say APP Ohi hear IND the woman PRP.kill rat
        ‘The man told Ohi that the woman killed a rat.’25
  Responses to émé' ze li re questions allow not only li…í marked purposive clauses but also òhíó
‘cause’ headed phrases with selected purposive clause information.(i) émé' ó zé-í'           lí     ó ré'         ré àlèkè énhén ìkhùnmì?

   Purposive result clauses also occur with verb ze ‘cause, allow,’ which takes a limited range of S-
and VP complements. It is found with indicative khi and purposive result li re complements but only
if ze’s subject pronominal corresponds to a focus position constituent.(i) a. òjè lí ó zé-í'             khí ólì òkpòsò gbé         ólí ófè.

  Exceptive marker sòkpén appears derived from an idiomatic serial verb sequence so ‘to touch’ and
kpen ‘be next to.’ Although not widely used at present, this sequence manifests an exclusionary
sense consistent with sòkpén. In addition, this marker seems more prominent in the neighboring
Ora dialect than in Emai.(i) a. è    só         kpén    óí vbí ékùèè ré.
       they PRP.touch next.to him LOC meeting arrive
       ‘They excluded him from the meeting.’
    b. è    só         kpén    óí vbì ò ré.
       they PRP.touch next.to him LOC it arrive
       ‘They excluded him from it.’28
 A noteable exception, however, is that cross clause subjects in sòkpén constructions where a
whole-part relation (e.g. áléké ~ áwé óì) exists are acceptable.(i) áléké ó ò jàjá               sòkpén khí áwé óì kèré        gbè.
    Aleke SC H be.energetic except IND legs her be. small t oo.much
    ‘Alekei is energetic except that heri legs are too small.’29
  When the òhíó khi clause is in focus position preceding li/ni, a polar question is allowed. When
òhíó khi is in topic position, a polar question is disallowed.(i) a. òhíó khí òhí kéè            gbé ófè ní áìn lí ólí ómó ó ò rè gbé?
        cause IND Ohi PRP.ANT kill rat APP him PF the child SC H take dance
        ‘Was it because Ohi afterward killed a rat for him that the child dances?’
    b. *òhíó khí òhí kéè          gbé ófè ní áìn, ólí ómò ò ó gbé?
        cause IND Ohi PRP.ANT kill rat APP him the child SC C dance
        ‘Was it because Ohi afterward killed a rat for him that the child is dancing?’30
   Clauses headed by èmìdí and òhíó exhibit asymmetric behavior with respect to their constituent
clause verb types. Clauses marked by òhíó and èmìdí fail to exhibit the same causal force across verb
pairs. For paired events denoted by o ‘enter’ and mie ‘see’ or moe ‘have’ and nwu li ‘give,’ only òhíó
is acceptable, not èmìdí. The principle behind this constraint is not clear at this time.(i) a. ó ó'             vbì ìwè òhíó khì ò míé            òhí.

  Phrases headed by èrímí never appear in canonical declaratives as direct objects of re ‘take’ in
series.(i) *òhí ré'       èrímí ísì ólì òkpòsò váré'.
     Ohi PAP.take behalf ASS the woman come
     ‘Ohi came on behalf of the woman.’32
  It is not only èrímí phrases that restrict information questions. èrímí’s complement also fails to
take an interrogative pronoun.(i) a. èrímí' mè lí ójé ré'           yé       òkè.
        behalf me PF Oje PAP.take move.to Oke
        ‘It was on my behalf that Oje went to Oke.’

        behalf who PF Oje PAP.take move.to Oke
        ‘On whose behalf did Oje go to Oke?’33
  Benefactive èrímí and causal òhíó associatives exhibit contrasting interpretations of their associ-
ated possessor location. With òkpòsò ‘woman’ as possessor, òhíó assumes the woman to be in the
target location, therefore implying (ib), while èrímí phrases make the opposite assumption, imply-
ing (id).(i) a. òhíó ísì òkpòsò lí ójé ré'            yé       áfúzé'.

with good fortune that is positioned as a deity staff.
     Here it is. It is I who am called Monday. Do you not see these people who live in
this very place? It is as eye witnesses that all live in this very place.
     There were two women who were in the village. They were called Aaegbe and
Ionlesen. These two women, they were more beautiful than anything that had ever
yet been experienced. This one who was called Aaegbe, she was beauty beyond
measure. Witness this thing. These are women? Where among womankind did these
ones come from? So Aaegbe prepared her things. She told Ionlesen, there is no other
job that one will do other than prostitution. That one said it. It isn’t so, is it?
     This Aaegbe who must have had this conversation, a wound made havoc on her
leg. It is with a rag that she wraps it. But it was this Aaegbe alone that men liked
more, it is they who searched up and down for her. She said, “Look at it, Ionlesen,
since it was discovered that it is I that men are fond of, one surely hasn’t found how
one will deal with it. But the wound which is on this leg of mine, this leg will be
exchanged for another one.” Ionlesen said, “It isn’t so is it? The money that will be
made afterward, it will be mixed together.” Aegbe said, “It will be mixed together. It
will be saved and used to eat food.” Ionlesen said, “It is fine.”
     Just as they were having this conversation, three young men came. At once,
they knocked on the door, ratatattat. Yes, Aaegbe said, “I say that I have come.
What are you searching for?” They said, “Aaegbe. I say that we will take you to La-
gos.” Aaegbe said, “Lagos? Ionlesen, I say come, this wound, it does not know how
to become large. When I remove the cloth from it, I say that men will disperse and
run away.” Ionlesen said, “There isn’t anything else to do. I will just hold it for you.”
980 | Sample oral narrativeIonlesen then said, “Aaegbe, I say bring your leg.” So they exchanged legs with
each other. Each leg locked into place. Aaegbe then said, “It isn’t so, is it?” Aaegbe
then said, I want to bathe. So she bathed don’t you know. Ionlesen picked out her
things. She then said, “I am coming, in order to enter the room.” After she glanced
about, she did not see Aaegbe. So she started to sing a song.
    SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a
favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe. This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe,
Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
    Don’t you see it? One does not lead another one on to some place, as might be
thought. I wonder whether you are seeing it. As a result, Ionlesen picked out her
things. She approached the door. She then said, “A group of young men of this
kind.’ She then said, “I ask you for the person I am searching for.” One said, “Who
are you surely searching for?” Ionlesen said, “Who do you surely search for?” Ion-
lesen then said, “Aaegbe.” One said, “It is beauty that has overtaken her.” Another
said, “Yes, Aaegbe, she picked out her things just recently, she proceeded to Afuze,
don’t you know.” Ionlesen also put her legs to walking.
    SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a
favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe. This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe,
Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
    “A plight,” Ionlesen then said, “A plight is this one. Aaegbe.” Ionlesen started
walking. She reached Afuze. One said, “Just recently Aaegbe came out from this
room. When you see her, she and the men, she took the men to her. When they posi-
tion each other noisily, they crash onto the ground from the bed. They make noises
with their bodies. They crash on the ground from the bed. They make noises with
their bodies. They thump on the mat.” One said, “How will one deal with this one?”
One said, “Aaegbe, I say that she just came out recently. She proceeded to Otuo.”
Ionlesen said yes, it is walking that I have started. I intend to do goodness, I do it
but what do I get in return? So she started to sing a song.
    SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a
favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe. This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe,
Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
    Don’t you see it? So Ionlesen reached Otou. After she reached Otuo, she encoun-
tered young men assessing each other. Some were jumping away at the window. She
then said, “I ask you please, rescue me.” One asked her, “What happened to you?”
She said, “It is Aaegbe I search for.” One said, “Aaegbe? She just picked up her
                                                 Two Women, a Wound and a Rag | 981things recently, she proceeded to Benin City.” Ionlesen said that the place where I
should happen to move to is the place where I start out from. So Ionlesen then
picked out her things.
      SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a
favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe. This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe,
Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
      It is just so, isn’t it? So Ionlesen started on her journey, briskly moving on. So
she reached Benin City, don’t you know. After she reached Benin City, she encoun-
tered that the entirety of the young men, they were seething a great deal. Sweat was
overcoming everyone completely on their shoulder blade. Ionlesen said, “How?”
Ionlesen said, “I say that it is Aaegbe I am searching for.” One said he took one
woman who was beautiful in that way just recently. Another said, “Yes, she picked
out her things. She said she was going to Lagos.” Ionlesen then said, “Is it I who am
this one? The wound will infest me today. I will be infested by this wound today.
The wound, it is, Aaegbe then told me, take, hold it for me. I held the wound for her.
It is an act of goodness that I performed.” So Ionlesen walked to Lagos.
      SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a
favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe. This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe,
Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
      That is how it is. There passed one market week, one fortnight, walking is what
Ionlesen did. It is she. Her toes were about to wither away on the road to Lagos. “I
will just ensure that I will see her today.” Ionlesen, she shuffled into Lagos. The
people said, “Greetings.” Another said, “Greetings.” This one said, “Greetings.” She
then said, “This thing you speak, this is not the language I know. I say that it is a
person I search for. There is no one who will give me a helping hand?” One said,
“Whom do you search for?” She said, “One small girl that is called Aaegbe.” One
said, “Go into that room, you will meet her in there.” So Ionlesen entered the room
don’t you know. It was men she met. She said, “I ask you about the woman you
carried into this room.” One said, “Yes, it is Aaegbe who proceeded to Ajegunle and
entered inside Lagos. What? Ajegunle inside Lagos.” “Is it Ajegunle that she now
entered?” He then said, “It is just so.”
      SONG: This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe, Aaegbe of havoc,
Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not know how to return a
favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe. This village, if you see Aaegbe, if you see Aaegbe,
Aaegbe of havoc, Aaegbe of wretchedness, Aaegbe of ingratitude, who does not
know how to return a favor, let illness overtake Aaegbe.
982 | Sample oral narrative     It is that way that one experienced it don’t you know. So Ionlesen reached
Ajegunle. After she was coming, she encountered young men. What does one now
call this kind of person? “I ask you to allow me to pass, for it is a person I am search-
ing for.” One said, “I say that Aaegbe is just in the room.” After Ionlesen came to the
room, she found that Aaegbe had plaited the hair with an enticing hair style (one-
looks-at-me-does-not-look-elsewhere). Ionlesen then said, “Aaegbe, I am coming so
that your wound should infest you, so that this wound should infest you. You asked
me to hold your wound for you. The wound, you gave it to me. You shuffled into
Lagos. It is I who now experienced suffering.” Aaegbe who is infested with a wound,
she is beautiful throughout. Aaegbe, take the wound. Ionlesen said, “It was surely
not discovered how one will deal with it. Since it happened this way, bring your
shin in order that we should exchange them, in order for you to take hold of your
wound.” Aaegbe pulled her buttocks near her back. I say that it is so, isn’t it? Ion-
lesen said, “I intend to also now reach womanhood of my own and exhibit beauty
like you. For, indeed, we should reach womanhood together.” So Aaegbe brought
her shin. So Ionlesen brought her shin. So they each fit their own shin into place.
This is the reason that when a person bruises a leg at the shin, the wound it makes
on the shin is messy. The story just finishes that way.

"7.5.2.1 Place ébé' / ébí'
The interrogative pronoun ébé'/ébí' in question word position articulates direct and
indirect questions of Place. In canonical declaratives, ébé'/ébí' never occurs as a

Interrogative pronoun ébé'/ébí' (likely shortened from élàbé/élàbí) and Manner
preverb i/e in the matrix clause express Manner ‘how.’ Direct and indirect questions
illustrate position and function of the ébé'/ébí'...i frame.(73) a. ébé' ólí ómóhé í'          híán ólí óràn?

Alternative forms articulate direct and indirect questions of Person. An interrogative
pronoun with the number shapes singular óe'/ói' and plural éé'/éí' frame Person
direct questions. When the question word corresponds to matrix subject, a pronoun
appropriately shaped for case and number (singular o, plural e) occurs in matrix
subject position. For indirect object position marked by Applicative li/ni, a zero
pronoun corresponds to the interrogative pronoun for person.(80) a. óé' ó híán'      ólí óràn?
        who he PAP.cut the wood
        ‘Who cut the wood?’

    d. éé'   ólí ómóhé ré'        émà ní?
       whom the man PAP.take yam APP
       ‘Whom did the man give yam to?’Indirect questions of Person rely on the relative pronoun ólì/élì with its singu-
lar/plural forms. Question position in indirect interrogatives never accepts pronoun
óé'/óí' ~ éé' /éí'. When the question word corresponds to matrix subject, a pronoun
appropriately shaped for case and number (singular ó, plural é) occupies subject
position. When the question word corresponds to indirect object marked by Applica-
tive li/ni, the matrix clause exhibits a zero pronoun.(81) a. ì één         ólí / *óé' ó híán'     ólí óràn.

structions. Disfavored are relevant noun phrases in situ.(82) óé' ó híán'       ólí óràn?

Direct and indirect questions of Possessor are framed by Person interrogative pro-
nouns and relative pronouns. However, question shape varies according to direct or
indirect status. Direct questions utilize interrogative pronoun óé'/óí'~éé'/éí' as com-
plement of an Associative ísì phrase, the entire phrase being in question position.(83) a. éwé ísì óé' ólí ómóhé nwú'           lí  ònwìmè?
        goat ASS who the man PAP.take APP farmer
        ‘Whose goat did the man give to the farmer?’
     b. éwé ísì éé' ólí ómóhé nwú'            lí  ònwìmè?
        goat ASS who the man PAP.take APP farmer
        ‘Whose goat did the man give to the farmer?’Indirect questions of Possessor assume either of two shapes. When the question
position constituent corresponds to a matrix relation other than subject, the relative
pronoun ólì appears in question position and a personal pronoun (òí) occupies the
corresponding matrix clause position.17(84) a. ì één         ólí ójé nwú'        éwé ísì òí lí      ònwìmè.
          I PRP.know one Oje PAP.take goat ASS his APP farmer

          I PRP.know goat ASS one Oje PAP.take APP farmer
          ‘I knew whose goat Oje gave to the farmer.’When the question constituent in an indirect question with Possessor corefers to
matrix clause subject, an entire Associative ísì phrase (éwé ísì ólí) occurs in embed-
ded clause initial position. The relative pronoun ólí serves as Possessor. Subject in
the matrix clause then requires a personal pronoun (e.g. ó).(85) a. ì één       éwé ísì ólí ó ó'           vbì ìwè.

headless associative phrases or Possessor noun phrases. Unacceptable are simple
noun phrases in Specifier copula constructions, or full associative phrases in situ.(86) éwé ísì óé' ólí ómòhè nwú'              lí    ònwìmè?

The interrogative pronoun émé'/émí' frames direct and indirect Object questions.
Direct questions show émé'/émí' in question position. Indirect questions also show
émé'/émí' in clause initial position under the verb een, as head of an unmarked

Conditional Purpose interrogatives require question word émé'/émí' and clause final
Subjunctive form ni. Direct questions show the contrasting positions of émé'/émí'

        ‘What kind of question did the man ask Ohi to consider?’While Kindred émé'/émí' appears in no indirect question, a relative clause headed
by a bare noun expresses a Kindred-like function.21(98) a. ì één         úróó      lí ú à zé.

        ‘I knew the question that the man asked Ohi to consider.’As responses to kindred direct questions, one finds semantically relevant nouns in

The question word ékà ‘quantity’ articulates direct and indirect questions of Quanti-
ty. Direct questions illustrate the position and function of ékà. When ékà corre-
sponds to matrix subject, a subject pronoun is obligatory.(101) ékà      ó rì      vbí ááìn?

questions accept pronouns for cardinal numerals (e.g. èvá), collective numerals (e.g.
èvèvá), collective universal quantifier (èrèmé) or partitive existential quantifier
(ésò). These forms occur in situ or in simple syntactic phrases but not in Specifier
copula óò constructions. Among existential quantity forms, it is only contrastive
existential quantifier évbèé that is unacceptable.(103) ékà      ó rì      vbí ááìn?

Quantity questions with partitive sense take either of two patterns with ékà and a
noun.22 Either ékà appears after a bare count noun in question position or ékà ap-
pears in question position and, in the matrix clause, a count noun modified by defi-
nite article élí remains in a vbi marked partitive phrase.23(104) a. érán ékà       ólí ómóhé bén-nó'-ì?

         quantity the man PAP.able cut-DS LOC the trees
         ‘How many of the trees was the man able to cut?’Direct questions of Partitive Quantity are structured differently from indirect ques-
tions only with respect to the latter’s obligatory inclusion of relative clause marker li
after ékà.(105) a. émá ékà      ójé húá'      lí   ònwìmè?

         I PRP.know yam quantity R Oje PAP.take APP farmer
         ‘I knew how many yams Oje gave to the farmer.’Indirect partitive questions also show ékà after a bare noun or alone in question
position with the noun, now modified, in a partitive vbi complement.(106) a. ì één       érán éká       lí ójé bén-nó'-ì.

sions. With ékà and a bare noun in question position, direct questions accept quan-
tity pronouns, including cardinal numerals (e.g. èvá), the collective numerals (e.g.

questions relate to subject and direct object positions. ékà Cost questions occur
when the matrix clause shows a verb whose direct object is subcategorized for cost,
e.g. hae ‘pay.’ Direct questions of Cost with these verbs show ékà in question posi-
tion, while indirect questions show ékà as head of a li/ni marked relative clause.(115) a. ékà      ólí ómóhé háé'-ì?
         quantity the man PAP.pay-F
         ‘How much did the man pay?’
      b. ì één        éká    lí ólí ómóhé háé'-ì.
         I PRP.know quantity R the man PAP.pay-F
         ‘I knew how much the man paid.’As well, ékà questions occur when Cost corresponds to subject. Direct questions of
Cost appear in Equational Identity í khi constructions, where ékà in question posi-
tion corresponds to Identity subject pronoun í. There is no corresponding indirect
question of Cost formed with Equational Identity.

      ‘How much is this one?’           ‘I knew how much this one was.’Questions of Cost can be formed with ékà as complement of Associative ísì and its
preceding head noun. Direct questions of Cost show an entire ísì phrase in question
position. It is ísì that differentiates questions of Quantity from questions of Cost.24(117) a. órán ísì ékà          ólí ómóhé híán'-ì?

         log quantity the man PAP.cut-F
         ‘How many logs did the man cut?’Indirect questions of Cost require a relative clause shape. In addition to an ísì phrase
with ékà as complement, they show relative clause Relator li/ni following the ísì
phrase.(118) ì één        órán ísì éká          lí ólí ómóhé híán'-ì.
      I PRP.know wood ASS quantity R the man PAP.cut-F
      ‘I knew the cost of the wood that the man cut.’Responses to direct questions of Cost vary in syntactic shape. When direct questions
are framed by ékà relative to a verb whose direct object is subcategorized for cost,
acceptable responses include: nominals modified by cardinal numerals in focus
position, in Specifier copula óò constructions or in syntactically simple phrases.
Unacceptable are modified nominals in situ or in headless associative phrases.(119) ékà       ólí ómóhé háé'-ì?

"6.6 Ideophonic adverbs
Ideophonic adverbs articulate meanings that reflect speaker perspective. They need
not express a meaning shared by speaker and hearer and as such are not open to
interrogation by a hearer. Like other adverbs, they occupy postverbal position and
induce high tone spread in an immediately preceding noun phrase constituent.
     Ideophonic adverbs assume a variety of morphological shapes and often ex-
press meanings typically lexicalized in English verbs. Some exhibit reduplication or
triplication.gbírígbírí ‘jerkily’                      dúdúdú    ‘very dark’
ghóíghóí ‘glisteningly’                   kpákpákpá ‘tremblingly’
púpúpú ‘flappingly’                       kpékpékpé ‘shiveringly’
kpíkpíkpí ‘flutteringly’                  gbágbágbá ‘slappingly’Others fail to exhibit either reduplication or triplication.píí ‘flingingly’                          wóò ‘smackingly’
váí ‘snatchingly’                         gbìó ‘crackingly’
bóí ‘poppingly’                           yáá ‘simmeringly’
yóò ‘whoosh’                              húú ‘pungently’Ideophonic adverbs co-occur with a single verb or a few verbs of similar sense.
While they seem closely related to clause assertion, ideophonic adverbs do not fall
within the scope of assertion as judged by émé'…u ‘what happen,’ émé'…ruan ‘what
happen,’ and émé'…u ‘what do’ questions. Responses to these question types that
include an ideophonic adverb (e.g. pèú, gábé, bóbóbó) are unacceptable.(135) émé' ójé ú'-ì?

      ‘Oje ran.’                          ‘Oje scampered off.’     Some ideophonic adverbs appear to heighten an event’s intensity level vis-à-vis
its predicate. The verb si, for instance, has the sense ‘draw, pull,’ whereas the collo-
cation of si and the ideophonic adverb gúómí ‘with a jerk’ conveys a meaning equiv-
alent to the English verb ‘jerk, cause a sudden jerky movement.’ Likewise, the collo-
cation of verb khaan ‘pound’ and ideophone gùán ‘with a poke’ specifies English
verb ‘poke.’ khaan alone does not express ‘poke’; instead, it conveys ‘pound.’(138) a. ólì àgbèdé      sí'         óí vbí éán gúómí.
         the blacksmith PAP.draw him LOC here with.a.jerk

         he PRP.pound it move.against them LOC mouth
         ‘He pounded it against their mouth.’With similar effect, other ideophonic adverbs (e.g. kútúkútú, tòbótòbó, yéyéyé) ex-
press meanings encapsulated by the English verbs ‘seethe,’ ‘glitter’ and ‘quiver.’
338 | Adverbial adjunctsThese adverbs combine with verbs (tin, jin, guo) that alone convey the related senses
‘boil,’ ‘shine’ and ‘shake,’ respectively.(139) ólì àmè ò ó tìn kútúkútú.

A subclass of postverbal adverbs consists of forms whose base morpheme corre-
sponds to a synchronic verb. Deverbalized adverbs exhibit severe syntactic limita-
tions. Among these forms are reduplicated rùrùrúrú and bìbìbíbí. Each corresponds,
respectively, to extant verbs ruru ‘be foolish’ and bibi ‘move in zigzag fashion.’(143) a. òjè ò ó tà       étá    rùrùrúrú. /   ójé ó ò rùrú.
         Oje SC C speak words foolishly        Oje SC H be.foolish
         ‘Oje is speaking foolishly.’          ‘Oje is foolish.’
      b. òjè ò ó lá bìbìbíbí.              /   òjè ò ó bìbí.
         Oje SC C run staggeringly             Oje SC C move.zig.zaggedly
         ‘Oje is running with a stagger.’      ‘Oje is zigzagging.’Deverbal adverbs tend to be syntactically restricted. They occur in clauses inflected
for imperfect aspect. They reject perfect and prospective aspect.(144) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó tà        étá    rùrùrúrú.
         the man SC C speak words foolishly
         ‘The man is speaking foolishly.’
      b. ólí ómóhé ó ò tà        étá    rùrùrúrú.
         the man SC H speak words foolishly
         ‘The man speaks foolishly.’Deverbal adverbs correspond to direct questions framed by manner ébé'/ébí' …i
‘how’ or extent ébé'/ébí'…i…se ‘to what extent.’ Responses show adverbs in situ, not
as simple adverb phrases.
340 | Adverbial adjuncts(145) ébé' ólí ómóhé ó ò í           tà   étà?
      how the man SC H MAN speak words
      ‘How does the man speak?’
      ò ó tà       étá     rùrùrúrú.    /    *rùrùrúrú.
      he C speak words foolishly              foolishly
      ‘He is speaking foolishly.’             ‘Foolishly.’     Regarding polarity and mood, deverbal adverbs fail to appear in imperatives,
prohibitives, negative statements or polar questions, as an unacceptable polar ques-
tion suggests (*ólí ómòhè ò ó tà étá rùrùrúrú? [the man SC C speak words foolishly]
‘Is the man speaking foolishly?’).
     Discourse repositioning of deverbal adverbs is unacceptable. They fail in li/ni
focus position and in topic position.(146) *rùrùrúrú lí ólí ómóhé ó ò tà           étà.
       foolishly PF the man SC H speak word
       ‘It is foolishly that the man speaks.’6.8 Linear order of adverbs
Postverbal adverb classes exhibit order relations relative to a matrix verb.13 The
preferred order shows Manner nearest the verb and Temporal Deixis farthest from
the verb. Between these two are ordered Extent, Manner-demonstrative, Frequency,
Quantity and Place adverbs. Place is closer to Temporal-Deixis than Man-
ner/Frequency/Quantity. Order restrictions among classes also affect positioning
relative to complex predicates with postverbal particles or verbs in series.14                       V MA EX MD / FQ / QU / PL TDTemporal deictic adverbs (òdè) follow but do not precede adverbs of Place (vbí
áfúzé') and Aspectual Extent (sésésé).(147) a. ólí ómóhé dá'          ényó vbí áfúzé' òdè.

poral Deixis (òdè) appear only in that order.

"14.1 Conditional relations
Relations of logical or temporal condition (henceforth “conditional relations”) are
marked as subordinate in multi-clause constructions. They show an auxiliary in one
class of constructions and a complementizer in another. Among conditional rela-
tions are several semantic types. Linked subordinate and matrix clauses constrain
aspect and modality, their linear order, and subject coreference.
    Hypothetical form kha participates in four conditional types: perfect, imperfect,
prospective, and counter-to-fact, respectively illustrated below.(1) a. ólí ómòhè khà        káàwó óvbí óì, ò gbé             évìè á.
       the man PRP.HYP look.at child his he PRP.break tears CS
       ‘When the man looked at his child, he burst into tears.’
    b. ólì òkpòsò khà        áà záwó òhí, ò ó             vbì ìwè.
       the woman PRP.HYP RC see Ohi he PRP.enter LOC house
       ‘Whenever the woman saw Ohi, she entered the house.’s
    c. ólì òkpòsò khà        míé òhí, ó ló         ò    vbì ìwè.
       the woman PRP.HYP see Ohi she PRED enter LOC house
       ‘If the woman sees Ohi, she will enter the house.’
    d. ólí ómóhé khà         míé òhí, ó khà          ó      vbì ìwè.
       the man PAP.HYP see Ohi he PAP.HYP enter LOC house
       ‘If the man had seen Ohi, he would have entered the house.’    Independent of these constructions, kha serves as an epistemic auxiliary. In that
function it assumes the existence of an unspecified hypothetical condition that
controls event realization and asserts that had this condition been fulfilled, an event
would have occurred. Epistemic kha shows low tone and appears with a marked
melody subject phrase (right edge high tone).(2) a. ólí ómóhé khà       gbé ólí ófè.
       the man PAP.HYP kill the rat
       ‘The man would have killed the rat.’

       the men PAP.HYP IG eat rats
       ‘The men would have started eating rats (were it required).’A second marker of conditional subordination is complementizer si. It occurs in
circumstantial and purposive condition constructions.(3) a. ó ló      ò      vbí ìwè     sí      ó míé'    òhí.

       he HOR try p ot        inspect COND soup PRP.remain arrive
       ‘He should examine the pot to determine if soup remained.’In other constructions, si marks an embedded S-complement. It contrasts with in-
dicative khi and subjunctive li. It specifies speaker judgment that the grammatical
subject is committed only conditionally to the truth value of information in the em-
bedded clause.(4) ólì òkpòsò ò ó mìàá sí         ólí óvbèkhàn é        ólí émà.

tion on the time axis as a condition for realizing another event. Their subordinate
clauses are framed by kha and an intention bearing verb.1(5) ò khà        káàwó óvbí óì, ò gbé               évìè á.
    he PRP.HYP look.at child his he PRP.break tears CS
    ‘When he looked at his child, he burst into tears.’     Clauses in perfect condition constructions constrain aspect, relative tense, line-
ar order of subordinate and matrix clauses as well as subject coreference. Their
subordinate clauses limit aspect and relative tense. They inflect for Present perfect
(right edge low tone subject phrase and left edge high tone verb phrase) and show
low tone kha. Subordinate kha clauses reject Past perfect, imperfect and prospective
aspect.

framed by éghè re. However, their matrix clauses correspond to émé'/émí' ‘what’ in u
‘do’ questions in which subordinate clause information appears in a si marked com-

Recurrent preverb a. Recurrent a is optional in the matrix clause, although not in
the subordinate clause. Imperfect condition constructions establish an event with
imperfect, noncompletive orientation on the time axis as a condition for realizing
the matrix event.2(14) a. ò khà       áà záwó òhí, ò ó             vbì ìwè.

        he PRP.HYP RC see Ohi he PRP.RC enter LOC house
        ‘Whenever he saw Ohi, he would enter the house.’    Imperfect condition constructions limit aspect, relative tense, clause order and

perfect. They show Recurrent preverb a following kha.3

     he PRP.HYP RC ANT SUB catch rat he PRP.fry it
     ‘Whenever he afterward caught a rat, he fried it.’     Matrix clauses in imperfect condition constructions inflect for Present perfect
and imperfect Continuous. Each aspect differentially impacts tone of the subordi-
nate clause. Recurrent a tone in the subordinate clause is high low with Present
perfect in the matrix clause but simply high with Continuous in the matrix. Imper-
fect condition matrix clauses do not inflect for Past perfect or imperfect Habitual.(18) a. ò khà       áà záwó òhí, ò ó            vbì ìwè.

       ‘He was boasting to his friends, whenever he drank wine.’Imperfect condition clauses occur in topic not focus position. That they do not oc-

swer a direct question. That is, imperfect condition clauses do not serve as respons-
es to direct questions of time framed by éghè re. However, their matrix clauses corre-
spond to émé'/émí' ‘what’ in u ‘do’ questions in which subordinate clause
information appears as a si marked complement clause. Responses correspond to

the time axis as a condition for a prospective (unrealized) event identified in the
matrix clause. Such a condition is framed by Hypothetical kha in the subordinate
clause and prospective Predictive ló in the matrix clause.

        ‘If he sees his child, he will break into tears.’    Prospective condition constructions restrain aspect, relative tense, linear order
of constituent clauses, and subject coreference. Matrix clauses in Predictive condi-
tions are limited to prospective Predictive aspect. They do not inflect for prospective
Anticipative ló or any other aspect. Subordinate clauses in prospective condition
constructions inflect for Present perfect. They reject Past perfect, imperfect and
prospective aspect.(24) ólì òkpòsò khà       nwú émà ré,        ó ló     dà ényò.

      she PRP.HYP ANT SUB take yam arrive he PRED drink wine
      ‘If she afterward / yet brought yam, he will drink wine.’When the prospective condition clause hosts an epistemic auxiliary, e.g. certaintive

     he PRP.HYP ANT SUB CER use hand touch him I PRED kill him
     ‘If he dares to touch him with his hand anymore, I will kill him.’    Prospective condition constructions flexibly order subordinate and matrix

er. For some prospective condition constructions, either subordinate or matrix
clause occurs in construction-initial position.

a condition for realizing a second event that has failed to transpire. Emai shows two
types of contrary-to-fact conditions: possible and impossible. The possible type
presents a counterfactual condition potentially reversible in the real world. The
impossible does not entertain reversibility. Subordinate clauses of both types are
framed by kha. Their linked matrix clauses show kha for possible conditions and
Predictive ló for impossible conditions.(32) a. ójé khà         míé òhí, ó khà         ó     vbì ìwè.

coreference. Subordinate and matrix clauses in possible condition counterfactuals
require aspect agreement. Both clauses inflect for Past perfect (right edge high tone
subject). They reject Present perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect. Likewise, pos-
sible condition counterfactuals do not accept relative tense Anterior ke or Subse-
quent kpe, either in subordinate and matrix clause, or in subordinate clause alone.(33) a. ólí ómóhé khà         míé òhí, ó khà        ó     vbì ìwè.

888 | Multi-clause constructions    In discourse, clauses in si constructions correspond to distinct direct question
types. Subordinate condition si clauses serve as responses to identity questions
framed by í yi (Chapter 7, 7.5.2.14), temporal noun éghè and a relative clause con-
taining erstwhile matrix clause information. As response, a si clause is acceptable.7(52) í yì      éghé lí ó ò ré ghònghón léé?

     ‘At which time is he happier?
     sí     ólí ómó ó ò sìé.
     COND the child SC H play
     ‘When the child plays.’Matrix clause propositions in si condition constructions serve as responses to
émé'/émí' direct questions framed by u ‘do’ and a si clause expressing the subordi-
nate proposition. In response, matrix clause information is required.(53) émé' ólí ómóhé ó ò ú sí            ólí ómó ó ò sìé?

     ‘What does the man do if the child plays?’
     ó ò kpè ìtásà.
     he H wash plate
     ‘He washes plates.’14.1.6 Purposive condition siConstructions framed by si receive a purposive interpretation when their matrix
clause expresses deontic modality, e.g. Hortative í, or the subordinate clause con-
veys prospective aspect, e.g. Anticipative ló. Purposive si constructions reflect addi-
tional constraints regarding aspect, relative tense, linear order of clauses and cross
clause subject coreference.
    Purposive si constructions restrict aspect and relative tense. Subordinate si
clauses inflect for Present perfect or Anticipative aspect. They disallow Past perfect,
imperfect Continuous or Habitual, and prospective Predictive.(54) a. ò í        fèè ùwàwà ghóó        sì     òmì kóó           rè.

not Anterior ke. When a purposive si subordinate clause shows Anticipative inflec-
tion with ló, it also permits Subsequent kpe, not Anterior ke.(55) a. ò í       fèè ùwàwà ghóó        sì     òmì kpé         kóó     rè.

        COND he ANTI SUB find wine drink he PAP.move.to there
        ‘In order to yet find wine to drink, he went there.’     Matrix clauses in purposive si constructions restrict aspect and relative tense as
well. They inflect for Past perfect and prospective Anticipative but not Present per-
fect, prospective Predictive, or either imperfect.(56) a. ò ló       fèè ùwàwà ghóó         sì     òmì kóó          rè.

        COND he ANTI SUB find wine drink he PAP.enter LOC there
        ‘In order to yet find wine to drink, he entered there.’Matrix clauses in si purposives allow subjunctive auxiliaries and preverbs. They
accept deontic Hortative í and Conative aspectualizer preverb òó.(57) a. ò í      fèè ùwàwà ghóó         sì    òmì kóó           rè.

        he CON try pot       inspect COND soup PRP.remain arrive
        ‘He went to examine the pot to determine if soup remained.’Matrix clauses accept neither relative tense Anterior ke nor Subsequent kpe (*ó ké' /
kpé' féé ùwàwà ghóó sì òmì kóó rè [he PAP.ANT/SUB try pot inspect COND soup
PRP.remain arrive] ‘He afterward / still examined the pot to determine if soup re-
mained’).
    Constructions framed by si purposives constrain clause order according to
mood. When the matrix clause is indicative and subordinate si clause is marked by
prospective Anticipative ló, si with purposive interpretation precedes the matrix
clause, i.e. subordinate subjunctive precedes matrix indicative.

         ‘He went there in order to yet find wine to drink.’When the matrix clause shows subjunctive (e.g. Hortative, Conative or Anticipative),
it precedes the si purposive, i.e. matrix subjunctive precedes subordinate indicative.(59) a. ò í        fèè ùwàwà ghóó      sì     òmì kóó            rè.

        he ANTI try pot        inspect COND soup PRP.remain arrive
        ‘He is about to examine the pot to determine if soup remained.’Constructions with si purposives do not require subject coreference. Disjoint subject
reference is acceptable.(60) ólí ómòhè í      fèè ùwàwà ghóó     sì     òmì kóó          rè.
     the man HOR try pot        inspect COND soup PRP.remain arrive
     ‘The man should examine the pot to determine if soup remained.’     In discourse, constituent clauses in purposive condition si constructions corre-
spond to different components of a direct question. Information in a subordinate
condition si clause serves as response to ‘why’ questions framed by émé'/émí', ze
‘cause,’ complementizer li and Concessive auxiliary re. As response, a si clause pre-
ceded by matrix clause information (showing subjunctive marking, e.g. Conative òó)
is required. A purposive condition si clause alone is insufficient. Moreover, si claus-
es never answer direct questions framed by éghè re ‘when.’(61) émé' ó zé-í'          lí   ó ré'     ó    fèè ùwàwà ghóó?

     ‘Whether soup has remained.’14.2 Concessive relations
Concessive relations are marked as subordinate in multi-clause constructions. For
one construction class, a single epistemic auxiliary or a combination of epistemic
auxiliaries express concessiveness. Concessive relations occur as perfect, prospec-
tive and counter-to-fact types. A second, less robust class relies on a complex com-
plementizer. Linked concessive clauses constrain aspect, modality, linear order, and
subject coreference.
     Concessive constructions rely on the presumed truth of one proposition as the
basis for judging the truth value of another. The proposition to which truth is con-
ceded is marked in Emai by epistemic modality form Concessive rere.8 Its matrix
clause is framed by various auxiliary forms. Concessives are identifiable in three
construction types: perfect, prospective and counterfactual, as illustrated below.(62) a. ò rérè          tá    ìyó, ó kpé'            ù.
        he PRP.CONC speak DMD he PAP.SUB die
        ‘Although he spoke that way, he still died.’
     b. ò khà         réré míé òhí, ó ló          ò     vbí ìwè.
        he PRP.HYP CONC see Ohi he PRED enter LOC house

     c. ó khà         rérè zé ólì ìzòbò, ó khà                kpé ù.
        he PAP.HYP CONC offer the sacrifice he PAP.HYP SUB die
        ‘Even if he had performed a sacrifice, he would yet have died.’As an epistemic auxiliary in simple clauses (Chapter 3, 3.1.3.2), Concessive rere has
the sense ‘even, supposedly.’(63) a. ólí ómóhé ó ò rèré tò            vbí émà.
        the man SC H CONC fond.of LOC yam
        ‘The man is even / supposedly fond of yam.’
     b. ò kéè         rèrè tá      ìyó?
        he PAP.ANT CONC speak DMD
        ‘Did he even speak that way afterward?’
892 | Multi-clause constructions14.2.1 Perfect concessive rerePerfect concessive constructions express the unexpectedness of one event while
conceding the truth of another. The concession, framed as a subordinate clause
marked by rere, is linked to a matrix clause. Perfect concessives restrict occurrence
of aspect, relative tense, linear order of their clauses, and subject coreference across
matrix and subordinate clause. They have no corresponding direct question.(64) òjè ké       rèrè zé ólì ìzòbò,           óvbí óì kpé         ù.
     Oje PRP.ANT CONC offer the sacrifice son his PRP.SUB die
     ‘Although Oje offered the sacrifice afterward, his son still died.’    Perfect concessive subordinate clauses inflect for Present perfect (right edge low
tone subject). They reject Past perfect, imperfect and prospective.(65) ólí ómòhè rérè        tá     ìyó, ó kpé'          ù.
     the man PRP.CONC speak DMD he PAP.SUB die
     ‘Although he has spoken that way, he still died.’Perfect concessive subordinate clauses accept relative tense Anterior ke, in either
pre- or post-rere position. Nonetheless, they never allow Subsequent kpe.(66) a. ò rérè        ké / *kpé tá     ìyó, ó kpé'          ù.

Present perfect, imperfect, and prospective aspect.(67) ò rérè         tá    ìyó, ó kpé'       ù.
     he PRP.CONC speak DMD he PAP.SUB die

ordinate concessive rere precedes, never follows its matrix clause.(69) a. ò réré            tá    ìyó, ó kpé'        ù.

         he PAP.SUB die he PRP.CONC speak DMD
         ‘He still died, although he has spoken that way.’Perfect concessive subordinate clauses appear in topic but not focus position, since
they do not allow a following focus marker li/ni.(70) *ò réré           tá    ìyó lí ó ré'             kpè ú.
      he PRP.CONC speak DMD PF he PAP.take SUB die

not required, although allowed.(71) a. òjè rérè       zé     ólì ìzòbò, ìgè kpé             ù.

        ‘Although Oje offered the sacrifice afterward, he still died.’14.2.2 Prospective concessive kha rere … lóProspective concessive constructions predict occurrence of one event regardless of a
second event. Subordinate clauses shows Hypothetical kha and Concessive rere, in
that order, and the matrix clause shows Predictive ló.(72) a. ò khà          rérè míé òhí, ó ló          ò    vbí ìwè.

        ‘Even if he makes the sacrifice, he will die.’
894 | Multi-clause constructions     Prospective concessive constructions limit aspect, relative tense, clause linear
order, and subject coreference across clauses. In these constructions, clause infor-
mation does not correspond to direct question components. Subordinate clauses

which failed to transpire, would not have impacted occurrence of a second. Truth
about one event's nonoccurrence fails to impact truth of another. The concession,
framed as subordinate by Hypothetical kha and rere in that order, links to a matrix
clause framed by Hypothetical kha.(80) ó khà         rérè ú émí èrèmé lessen,

       mother his PAP.HYP SUB utter grumble
    ‘Even if he had done all things well, his mother would still have grumbled.’     Counterfactual concessive constructions limit aspect, relative tense, linear order
of clauses, and subject coreference. They have no corresponding direct question.
     Counterfactual concessives severely restrain aspect and relative tense. Both
subordinate and matrix clause inflect for Past perfect (right edge high tone subject).
Neither inflects for Present perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(81) ó khà         rérè míé òhí, ó khà           ó     vbì ìwè.

reject a following li/ni focus marker.(86) *ó khà           rérè míé òhí lí ó khà            ré    ó       vbì ò.
      he PAP.HYP CONC see Ohi PF he PAP.HYP take enter LOC it
      ‘It is even if he had seen Ohi that he would have entered it.’Across clauses in counterfactual concessive constructions, subject coreference is
required. Disjoint subject reference is unacceptable.

         ‘Even if Oje had drunk wine, Aleke would still have died.’14.2.4 Contrary concessive bíì khiA construction with concessive significance is marked by a clause with Comitative
bíì and Indicative khi forms. In narratives, khi alone is sufficient to convey this rela-
tion, although bíì alone is not. In these constructions, the matrix event and the bíì
khi event are temporally coincident. Under normative conditions, the two events are
assumed to be socially contrary.9(88) a. ù    né        ìhòn, bíì khì ì ríì         vbí ààn.
        you PRP.pass fart COM IND I PRP.be LOC here
        ‘You passed a fart, even though I am here.’
     b. ù    né        ìhòn, khì ì ríì       vbí ààn.
        you PRP.pass fart IND I PRP.be LOC here
        ‘You passed a fart, even though I am here.’The contrastive nature of bíì khi constructions is suggested by their acceptance of
negation. Subordinate bíì khi concessive clauses show Perfect Negation ì, whereas
their matrix clauses do not.(89) a. ò ó dà        ényò, bíì khí ó ì       dààn.
        he C drink wine COM IND he NEG be.well
        ‘He is drinking wine, even though he is not well.’
     b. *ó ì       dà    ényò, bíì   khí ó dáán'.
         he NEG drink wine COM IND he PAP.be.well
         ‘He did not drink wine, even though he was well.’     The bíì khi concessive constrains aspect, relative tense, clause order and cross
clause subject coreference. Clause constituents in these constructions do not corre-
spond to direct question constituents.
     Subordinate and matrix clauses in bíì khi concessives restrict aspect and relative
tense. Concessive bíì khi clauses inflect for imperfect Continuous and Present per-
fect. They disallow Past perfect, imperfect Habitual, as well as prospective Anticipa-
tive and Predictive aspect.

not Habitual, Past perfect, or Predictive.(91) a. ù    á tà      étà, bíì khì ù á è émàè.

        ‘You are about to throw it away, even though I am here.’Matrix clauses in bíì khi concessives allow Subsequent kpe, not Anterior ke.(92) ù á kpé / *ké fì         ìsìgá, bíì khì ù á khònmè            ónwùé.
     you C SUB ANT blow cigar COM IND you C become.sick cough
     ‘You are still smoking, even though you are sick with a cough.’    In both matrix and subordinate clauses of contrary concessives, Continuous and
Present perfect are grammatical, although Anticipative in both is not.(93) a. ù á tà       étà,     bíì khì ù á è émàè.

erative concessive. It is framed by bíì khi and disjunct dà ‘or.’ This construction con-
strues one event as an ultimate wish or desire, given possible occurrence of a sec-
ond event. It is translated ‘at least, provided that.’ The desiderative concessive
clause requires auxiliaries kha and rere, while the accompanying clause requires
complementizer complex dà bíì khi. Constructions of this type appear most natural
with second person subjects in both clauses.(96) a. ù   khà         rérè lá lé',        dà bíì khì ù  kpé      ìtásà.

        you PRP.HYP CONC insult me or COM IND you NEG hit me thing
        ‘Even if you insult me, at least don't hit me.’Desiderative concessive clauses are strictly ordered. kha rere must precede dà bíì
khi. The converse order is unacceptable. In narrative discourse, concessive kha rere
clauses are often ellipted, leaving only the dà bíì khi clause.

Temporal relations in multi-clause constructions are designated as subordinate by
several grammatical strategies, namely aspect and relative tense auxiliary (ke, kpe)
or aspectualizer preverb (ghe); complementizer (bi) and Concessive auxiliary (re);
bare noun relative clause head in construction with verb re ‘take’ in series; or verb
in series (se, de) with following embedded complement or bare noun relative clause
head. Temporal relations coded include succession, concidence, condition, extent
and anticipation. Linked subordinate and matrix clauses constrain linear order,
aspect and modality, as well as subject coreference.","[901, 902, 903, 904, 905, 906, 907, 908, 909, 910, 911, 912, 913, 914, 915, 916, 917, 918, 919, 920, 921, 922, 923, 924, 925, 926]"
"14.3.2.1 Temporal coincidence ke / kpe and continuous aspect
A subordinate clause showing Continuous aspect and relative tense ke or kpe sig-
nals overlap of a temporal interval between distinct events. Coincidence at onset or
endpoint occurs with addition of aspectualizer ghe. Construction events are con-
strained as to linear order and subject coreference.
     Subordinate clauses with Continuous aspect and Anterior ke link to matrix
clauses in Past perfect. The matrix clause rejects Present perfect and both imper-
fects. The construction codes a temporal overlap between events.(121) òjè ò ó ké è émàè, ólí ókpósó lá'               lè.

Subordinate ke clause must precede the Past perfect matrix.(122) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó ké è émàè, ólí ókpósó lá'              lè.
         the man SC C ANT eat food the woman PAP.run depart

          the woman PAP.run depart the man SC C ANT eat food
          ‘The woman departed, as the man was eating food afterward.’For matrix and subordinate clauses showing temporal overlap, subject coreference
is not obligatory. Disjoint reference is permitted.(123) a. òjè ò ó ké ò            vbí ìwè, ólí ókpósó ú'-ì.

         Oje SC C ANT enter LOC house he PAP.fall-F
         ‘As Ojei was entering the house afterward, hei fell.’    Temporal overlap constructions are also framed by subordinate clauses show-
ing Continuous aspect and Subsequent kpe. Subordinate clauses so marked link to
matrix clauses inflected for Present perfect or Continuous imperfect. Past perfect or
Habitual imperfect in the matrix is unacceptable.(124) a. òjè ò ó kpé ìyó tà étà, ò ú                    émí èrèmé léé.

         ‘As he still speaks that way, he is already sharpening a knife.’Linear order of matrix and kpe clause in temporal overlap constructions is restricted.
The kpe clause precedes the matrix clause; it never follows.(125) *òjè ò ó rìè          úvbíágháé lèé,     ò ó kpé ìyó tà            étà.
       Oje SC C sharpen knife          TEMP he C SUB DMD speak word
       ‘Oje is already sharpening a knife, as he still speaks that way.’Across matrix and subordinate clauses, subject coreference is not required. Disjoint
reference is acceptable.

      ‘As she yet speaks that way, Oje is already sharpening his cutlass.’14.3.2.2 Temporal coincidence ghe and continuous aspect
Specification of a point of temporal overlap between events is introduced by Punc-
tual aspectualizer ghe (Chapter 3, 3.2.1.1). In one construction type, ghe and Contin-
uous aspect combine in a subordinate clause.14 Construction reference is to overlap
of subordinate event onset and matrix onset. In these constructions, matrix clause
inflection is Past perfect, not Present perfect or either imperfect. A subordinate
clause that fails to show Continuous but retains aspectualizer ghe, inflecting for
Present perfect for instance, does not express temporal overlap.(127) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó ghé hìàn órán lèé,          ó ú'-ì.
         the man SC C PCT cut wood TEMP he PAP.die-F
         ‘Just as the man was already cutting wood, he died.’
      b. *ólí ómòhè ghéè        híán óràn léé,    ó ú'-ì.
          the man PRP.PCT cut wood TEMP he PAP.die-F
          ‘Just as the man already cut wood, he died.’Matrix and subordinate clauses in point of temporal overlap constructions are rigid-
ly ordered. The subordinate ghe clause must precede its matrix clause.(128) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó ghé hìàn órán lèé,          ó ú'-ì.
          the man SC C PCT cut wood TEMP he PAP.die-F
          ‘Just as the man was already cutting wood, he died.’
      b. *ólí ómóhé ú'-ì,         ò ó ghé hìàn órán lèé.
          the man PAP.die-F he C PCT cut wood TEMP
          ‘The man died, just as he was already cutting wood.’Across matrix and subordinate clauses, subject coreference is not required. Disjoint
subjects are acceptable.(129) ólí ómòhè ò ó ghé hìàn ólí órán lèé,         ólí ókpósó ú'-ì.
      the man SC C PCT cut the wood TEMP the woman PAP.die-F
      ‘Just as the man was already entering the house, the woman died.’    Specification of a point of temporal overlap also occurs with a subordinate
clause framed by Continuous aspect, Punctual ghe and Anterior ke. Construction
reference is a point demarcated by onset of subordinate event and onset of matrix
                                                             Temporal relations | 909event. In these constructions, the matrix clause inflects for Past perfect, rejecting
Present perfect and imperfect.(130) ò ó ké ghé' hìàn órán lèé,          ó ú'-ì.
      he C ANT PCT cut wood TEMP he PAP.die-F
      ‘Just after he was already cutting wood, he died.’Linear order between matrix and subordinate clause in ke ghe constructions is re-
stricted. Subordinate clause precedes matrix clause.(131) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó ké ghé' hìàn órán lèé,            ó ú'-ì.
         the man SC C ANT PCT cut wood TEMP he PAP.die-F
         ‘Just after the man was already cutting wood, he died.’
      b. *ólí ómóhé ú'-ì,        ò ó ké ghé' hìàn órán lèé.
          the man PAP.die-F he C ANT PCT cut wood TEMP
          ‘The man died, just after he was already cutting wood.’Across point of temporal overlap clauses, subject coreference is not obligatory. Con-
joint and disjoint subjects both occur with ke ghe.(132) a. òjè ò ó ké ghé' ò          vbí ìwè, ólí ókpósó ú'-ì.
         Oje SC C ANT PCT enter LOC house the woman PAP.die-F
         ‘Just after Oje was entering the house, the woman died.’
      b. òjè ò ó ké ghé' ò             vbí ìwè,    ó dé'-ì.
         Oje SC C ANT PCT enter LOC house he PAP.fall-F
         ‘Just after Ojei was entering the house, hei fell.’    Use of ghe to demarcate temporal overlap conditions is not confined to the sub-
ordinate clause. It appears in matrix clauses when the accompanying subordinate
clause also contains ghe.(133) ò ó ké ghé' è émàè, é             ghé'      sá    óí òísí'.
      he C ANT PCT eat food they PAP.PCT shoot him gun
      ‘Just after he was eating food, they just shot him with a gun.’When ghe occurs only in the matrix clause, overlap of terminal points for subordi-
nate and matrix event is not asserted. Instead, temporal coincidence characterizes
the time interval between a point in time after the subordinate event and onset of
matrix event.

         ‘After he was eating the food, they just shot him with a gun.’14.3.2.3 Temporal coincidence bi…re
A third syntactic shape expressing temporal coincidence between events is framed
by a subordinate clause showing bi in clause-initial complementizer position and
the Concessive simple form re in the auxiliary phrase. Construction reference de-
notes an overlap of temporal intervals but is indefinite as to point of alignment.
Both bi and re are required in the subordinate clause.15(135) bí ólí ómóhé ó ò ré        hòò úkpùn, ó ò sò íòò.
      as the man SC H CONC wash cloth he H sing song
      ‘As / While the man washes clothes, he sings.’    Temporal bi…re and it matrix clause agree in aspect, either Past perfect or im-
perfect Habitual. Agreement does not extend to Present perfect, imperfect Continu-
ous or prospective Predictive and Anticipative.(136) a. bí ó ré′          míé òhí, ó ó'            vbì ìwè.

         as the man SC H CONC wash cloth he H sing song

       as he PAP.CONC see Ohi PF he PAP.take enter LOC house
       ‘It was as / while he saw Ohi that he entered the house.’Across temporal coincidence clauses, subject coreference is not required. Subordi-
nate and matrix clause allow disjoint subjects.(139) bí ólí ómóhé ó ò ré         gbé, òhí ó ò kpè ìtásà.

     *bí ó ré'           míé òhí.
      as he PAP.CONC see Ohi
      ‘As / While he saw Ohi.’When bi...re clauses include a time adverb with temporal predeterminer élá (e.g. élá
égbíà ‘the evening we discussed,’ Chapter 6, 6.1), they answer questions of time, as
does an adverb phrase incorporating élá and the time adverb.(141) éghè ú     ré'      míé óì?

      ‘When did you see him?’

      ‘While I was coming to the house in the morning we talked about.’
      élá égbíà.
      TP morning
      ‘In the morning we discussed.’    A point of temporal coincidence between events in bi...re frames is signaled by
Punctual ghe in the subordinate clause. Reference is to a coincident time point of
onset for subordinate event and matrix event. When ghe is added to the matrix
clause, temporal coincidence is not referenced.

A distinct but distributionally limited syntactic strategy conveys temporal coinci-
dence between events. The primary feature of this construction is a clause final
phrase headed by Comitative conjunct bíì, which accepts nominalized verbs such as
évìè ‘crying’ as complement.16 Position of the bíì phrase is fixed. It must follow the
matrix clause. Moreover, it never occurs in focus or topic position.(146) ó húá'         ìwàwà, bíì évìè.

matrix event. It consists of a matrix clause and a subordinate relative clause. The
relative is headed by one of the time nominals éghè ‘time,’ ìsòkpísòkpá ‘moment’ or
ètíní ‘anticipation’ followed by Relator li and verb re ‘take’ in series.","[932, 933, 934, 935, 936, 937, 938, 939]"
"14.3.1.1 Temporal succession ke
A sequential relationship between events is framed by Anterior relative tense ke. It
specifies that reference time of ke clause is temporally anterior or prior to reference
time of its matrix clause.(98) a. òjè kéè          ó     vbì ìwè, ólí ókpósó ú'-ì.

impose no limitation on coreference of constituent clause subjects.
     Within matrix and subordinate clauses in ke constructions, aspect choice is lim-
ited. Subordinate ke clauses inflect for Present perfect (right edge low tone subject)
and prospective Anticipative aspect with ló. As initial and sole auxiliary, ke exhibits
a high low tone. Following Anticipative ló, ke shows low tone. Subordinate ke claus-
es conveying temporal succession do not inflect for Past perfect or imperfect Con-
tinuous and Habitual.

onset of its matrix event. For immediate succession, ghe is obligatory in the subor-
dinate clause but optional in the matrix. Only ke event endpoint and matrix onset
come into perspective.11(108) a. ólí ómòhè kéè          ghé híán óràn léé,        ó ú'-ì.

         he PRP.ANT PCT eat food TEMP he PAP.PCT run depart
         ‘Just after he finished eating food, he just ran away.’Immediate succession ghe also occurs when a ke clause shows Anticipative aspect.
A relation of temporal immediacy is then defined by a prospective time point for the
ke event relative to onset of matrix event. Although ke event endpoint comes into
perspective through Anticipative ló, onset of the ke event shifts into perspective
when Ingressive ya follows Anticipative ló.(109) a. ò ló       kè ghé híán ólí óràn léé,          ó ú'-ì.

A contrasting sequential relationship is indicated by relative tense kpe. It specifies
that kpe clause reference time is temporally subsequent to matrix reference time.(110) ójé kpé'        ànmà díànré,     ó gbáló'        íkhúnmí ísì òí.
      Oje PAP.SUB agree come.out he PAP.tie.on charm ASS his
      ‘Before Oje agreed to come out, he tied on his charms.’In simple clauses, kpe expresses a subsequent relation for an assumed event relative
to a kpe marked event (Chapter 3, 3.1.4).(111) ólí ómóhé kpé'        ànmà díànré.
      the man PAP.SUB agree come.out
      ‘Despite a pending condition, the man still agreed to come out.’
904 | Multi-clause constructionsSubordinate kpe disallows another instance of kpe or an instance of ke. Similarly,
kpe subordinate clauses do not co-occur with kpe matrix clauses.(112) *ójé kpé'       ànmà díànré,     ó kpé'          gbáló íkhúmí ísì òí.
       Oje PAP.SUB agree come.out he PAP.SUB tie.on charm ASS his
       ‘Before the man agreed to come out, he still tied on his charms.’Clausal events linked by kpe require temporal bounding. Subordinate kpe events
lacking an inherent endpoint require Temporal Perspective lee. Matrix events lack-
ing an inherent endpoint thus show lee.(113) a. ójé kpé'        híán ólí óràn léé,    ó wéé'      ópìà èvá.

coreference. Across clauses, aspect choice is restricted. Temporal kpe inflects for
Past perfect, as does its matrix clause. Subordinate kpe clauses reject Present per-
fect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(115) a. ójé kpé'       ànmà díànré,      ó gbáló'       íkhúnmí ísì òí.

         ‘Before I burn it, it will dry out.’     Across matrix and subordinate clauses in kpe constructions, linear order is con-
strained in a variable fashion. Unlike ke, some kpe clauses exhibit flexible order vis-
à-vis their matrix clause. That is, they precede or follow a matrix clause.(117) a. ójé kpé'      ànmà díànré,     ó gbáló'        íkhúnmí ísì òí.

         ‘Oje put on his charms, before he agreed to come out.’With other event pairs, clause order is restricted. The preferred position of the kpe
clause is after the matrix clause.12(118) a. ó khónmé'              íkpè ìgbé, ó kpé'         ù.

points is indicated by three distinct construction types. They involve either Continu-
ous aspect in construction with ke, kpe or ghe, or clause initial complementizer bi in
construction with Concessive re. For each, coincidence is defined by either onset of
matrix and end point of subordinate or some other interval when matrix and subor-
dinate event overlap.","[926, 927, 928, 929, 930, 931, 932]"
"14.3.4.1 Temporal extent se vbi o khi
Constructions with se ‘reach’ specify that endpoint of matrix event and onset of
subordinate event are temporally coincident. se precedes locative preposition vbi,
whose complement, consisting of an embedded indicative khi clause, is obligatorily
extraposed. Complement position is assumed by nondeictic locative pronoun o
(Chapter 5, 5.5).

bedded clauses never precede their matrix clause (*ò sé vbì ò khì ò má ékhè léé, ó

      he PAP.work reach LOC it IND he PRP.make pots TEMP
      ‘He worked until he finished molding pots.’Matrix and embedded khi clauses in se constructions do not require subject corefer-

         Oje PAP.sell the cloth reach LOC it IND it PRP.tire him
         ‘Oje sold the cloth until it tired him.’In discourse, se khi constructions answer direct questions of temporal extent framed
by ébé'/ ébí'… i… se. Responses require both matrix clause and subordinate se vbi o
khi clause.(174) ébé' ó í'            gbé òhí sè?

      ‘He beat him until/ up to the time that he is sick.’14.3.4.2 Temporal extent de óbò li…re
Extent constructions are also framed by a matrix clause verb phrase immediately
followed by verb de and its direct object. The latter takes the shape of a relative
clause headed by nominal óbò ‘hand.’ This construction specifies persistence of
matrix event time beyond endpoint of subordinate event.(175) ó ì      ké dàán ghè dè            òbó lí ó ré'        gbé ólí ófè.

      ‘She has not been very well since she killed the rat.’
920 | Multi-clause constructions    Constructions with de óbò constrain aspect, modality and linear order. The óbò
‘hand’ relative clause shows Relator li and verb re ‘take’ in series.(176) áfúzé' lí ó ò ké díá dè             òbó lí ó ré'      shóó vbì èdó ré.
      Afuze PF he H ANT stay reach hand R he PAP.take exit LOC Edo arrive
      ‘It is in Afuze that he now stays since he left Edo.’Matrix clauses in de óbò constructions require noncanonical shape, as focus con-
structions or negative statements for instance. They never assume canonical affirm-
ative, declarative shape.(177) *ójé khónmé'            dè     óbó lí ó ré'   gbé ólí ófè.
       Oje PAP.become.sick reach hand R he PAP.take kill the rat
       ‘Oje has been sick since he killed the rat.’Relative clauses in de óbò constructions, like other relative clauses, inflect for Past
perfect. de óbò clauses reject Present perfect, imperfects, and prospectives.(178) ó ì     ké dàán ghè dè            òbó lí ó ré'       gbé ólí ófè.
      he NEG ANT be.well ever reach hand R he PAP.take kill the rat
      ‘He has not been very well since he killed the rat.’     Linear order of matrix and embedded relative in de óbò constructions is not re-
strained. The de óbò clause precedes or follows its matrix clause. When a de óbò
clause precedes its matrix clause, it occupies topic, not focus position, since it re-
jects a following li/ni focus marker (*dè òbó lí ó ré' gbé ófè lí ó ì ké rè dáàn ghé [reach

       ‘He has not been very well since he killed the rat.’14.4 Circumstantial relations
An event of circumstance is marked as subordinate by complementizers in construc-
tion with a preverb or a preverb plus verb in series. Relations of circumstance affect
temporal and causal dimensions. Clauses conveying relations of causal circum-
stance and circumstantial extent each employ complementizer ébé'/ébí' or
élàbé/élàbí and Manner preverb i/e. It is verb se ‘reach’ in series that distinguishes
circumstantial extent from causal circumstance.(181) a. ébé' ó í'            dá     ényò, ó ò ú ghèèghéé.
         as he PAP.MAN drink wine he H do senseless
         ‘As / Since he drank wine, he was senseless.’
      b. élábé ó ò í         vìé, évbóó èrèmé ó ò tò            égbé nì  áìn.
         as      he H MAN cry village all          SC H ache body APP him
         ‘As / Since he cries, the entire village feels pain for him.’
      c. ébé' òhí í'          dúá ábò sé,         àlèkè í ì        ànmá réhùnmè óì.
         as Ohi PAP.MAN rub hands reach Aleke SC NEG agree forgive him
         ‘Despite Ohi's pleading, Aleke did not agree to forgive him.’Complementizer ébé'/ébí' and preverb i/e framing circumstantial constructions are
also utilized in information questions. Questions of manner employ these two con-
stituents (Chapter 7, 7.5.2.2), while questions of extent utilize ébé'/ébí', preverb i/e
and verb se in series (Chapter 7, 7.5.2.3).(182) ébé' ólí ómóhé í'             gbé ólí ófè?
      how the man PAP.MAN kill the rat
      ‘How did the man kill the rat?’
      ébé' ólí ómóhé í'            dá    ényò sé?
      how the man PAP.MAN drink wine reach
      ‘How much wine did the man drink?’
922 | Multi-clause constructions14.4.1 Causal circumstance ébé' / ébí'…iCausal circumstance constructions specify one event as causal information assumed
to be true about circumstances that led to a second event. The assumed causal in-
formation occupies a subordinate clause with ébé'/ébí' and Manner preverb i. The
result event is conveyed by a matrix clause.(183) ébé' ó í'           dá    ényò, ó ò ú ghèèghéé.
      as he PAP.MAN drink wine he H do senseless
      ‘As / Since he drank wine, he was senseless.’    Causal circumstance constructions constrain aspect, relative tense and order of
constituent clauses, but they do not limit subject coreference. Subordinate causal
circumstance clauses restrict aspect and relative tense. They inflect for Past perfect
and imperfect Habitual. They reject Present perfect, imperfect Continuous and pro-
spective aspect.(184) a. ébé' ó í'            fí égbé déló égbè, é      sá'        óí òísí'.
         as he PAP.MAN toss body turn body they PAP.shoot him gun
         ‘As / Since he turned around, they shot him with a gun.’
      b. ébé' ó ò í        fì    égbé dèlò égbè, é    sá'         óí òísí'.
         as he H MAN toss body turn body they PAP.shoot him gun
         ‘As / Since he turns around, they shot him with a gun.’Subordinate causal circumstance clauses disallow relative tense Anterior ke and
Subsequent kpe (*ébé' ó ké' / kpé' ì fí égbé déló égbè, é sá' óí òísí' [as he PAP.ANT
SUB MAN toss body turn body they PAP.shoot him gun] ‘Since he afterward / still
turned around, they shot him with a gun’).
     Matrix clauses for causal circumstance inflect for Past perfect and imperfect
Habitual. They reject Present perfect, imperfect Continuous, and prospective Predic-
tive and Anticipative.(185) a. ébé' ójé í'            dìànré,   é    khú'     óì nwú.
         as Oje PAP.MAN come.out they PAP.chase him catch
         ‘Since Oje came out, they chased him and caught him.’
      b. ébé' ó ò í        sò íòò, ìyó lí ó ò í           gbé.
         as he H MAN sing song DMD PF he H MAN dance
         ‘Since he sings, so it is he dances.’Matrix clauses in causal circumstance constructions reject Anterior ke and Subse-
quent kpe (*ébé' ó í' fí égbé déló égbè, é ké' / kpé' sá óí òísí' [as he PAP.MAN throw
                                                        Circumstantial relations | 923body turn body they PAP.ANT SUB shoot him gun] ‘As / Since he turned around,
they afterward / still shot him with a gun’).
    Causal circumstance constructions restrict order of matrix and subordinate
clause. Subordinate clauses consistently precede their matrix clauses. Reversing the
order is unacceptable.(186) a. ébé' ó ò í        kpè ìtásà, úkpòkpá dé'         rè.
          as he H MAN wash plate one             PAP.fall arrive
          ‘As he washes plates, one fell down.’
      b. *úkpòkpá dé'         rè,    ébé' ó ò í     kpè ìtásà.
          one        PAP.fall arrive as he H MAN wash plate
          ‘One falls down, as he washes plates.’As a construction initial constituent, subordinate circumstantial clauses occur in
topic position. They do not occupy focus position, since a following li/ni focus
marker is unacceptable.18(187) *ébé' ó ò í       kpè ìtásà lí úkpòkpá ré'            dé rè.
       as he H MAN wash plate PF one               PAP.take fall arrive
       ‘It is as he washes plates that one falls.’Across subordinate and matrix clauses in causal circumstance constructions, sub-
ject coreference is allowed but not required.(188) ébé' ójé í'         kpé élì ìtásà léé, áléké húá'       íyàìn ó vbì ìkpékpé.
      as Oje PAP.MAN wash the plate TEMP Aleke PAP.take them CL LOC shelf
     ‘Since Oje finished washing the plates, Aleke put them on a shelf.’Information in causal circumstance constructions corresponds to distinct constitu-
ents in émé'/émí'…ze ‘why’ questions. émé'/émí'…ze corresponds to subordinate
clause information, while an indicative khi complement expresses matrix clause
proposition. Responses derive from the erstwhile subordinate clause. Acceptable
responses show a subordinate clause with ébé'/ébí' and Manner i/e.(189) émé' ó zé-í'           khì ò ó ú ghèèghéé?
      what it PAP.cause-F IND he C do senseless
      ‘Why is he acting senselessly?’
      ébé' ó í'          dá    ényò.
      as he PAP.MAN drink wine
      ‘Since he drank wine.’
924 | Multi-clause constructions14.4.2 Causal circumstance élàbé / élàbí' …iConstructions of causal circumstance are also framed by élàbé/élàbí in construction
with Manner preverb i/e. Phonological and tonal similarity suggest that élàbé/élàbí
is a likely historical precursor to ébé'/ébí'.(190) élàbé òhí ó ò í          vìé, évbóó èrèmé ó ò tò           égbé nì áìn.
      as     Ohi SC H MAN cry village all            SC H ache body APP him
      ‘Since Ohi cries, the entire village feels pains for him.’Unlike ébé'/ébí', élàbé/élàbí serves as a preposition within noun phrases to mark
simile constructions.(191) óvbékhán élàbí mè í khà           ù     mé ìyó.
      youth      like me SC PRONEG treat me DMD
      ‘A youth like me (of same status) will not treat me that way.’Not all causal circumstance constructions accept élàbé/élàbí and ébé'/ébí' equally.
The two are not entirely interchangeable, as illustrated below.(192) a. ébé' òhí í'          máá íkpùn léé,       ó húá'      óì ó vbì ìtébù.
          as Ohi PAP.MAN fold clothes TEMP he PAP.take it CL LOC table
          ‘Since Ohi already folded his clothes, he put them on the table.’
      b. *élàbé òhí í'          máá íkpùn léé,       ó húá'       óì ó vbì ìtébù.
          as     Ohi PAP.MAN fold clothes TEMP he PAP.take it CL LOC table
          ‘Since Ohi already folded his clothes, he put them on the table.’    The grammatical properties of élàbé/élàbí causal circumstance mirror those of
ébé'/ébí' constructions. Subordinate and matrix clause inflect for Past perfect and
imperfect Habitual, although the two clauses need not agree in aspect.(193) a. élabé ú í'             ú óí aìn, ìyó lí ó zá'           hùnmé.
         as     you PAP.MAN do it then DMD PF it PAP.RES be.good
         ‘The way you did it then, it is that way that is good.’
      b. élàbé ó í'           dá      ényò, ó ò ú ghèèghéé.
         as     he PAP.MAN drink wine he H do senseless
         ‘Since he drank wine, he acts senseless.’Like ébé'/ébí', élàbé/élàbí construction information corresponds to different con-
stituents in questions framed by émé'/émí'…ze ‘cause’ and indicative khi comple-
ment. The khi clause links to the erstwhile matrix clause. Responses show either

express a relation of factual circumstance and temporal coincidence between sub-
ordinate event endpoint and matrix event onset. Coincidence in circumstantial con-
structions requires that Punctual ghe precede Manner i/e in the subordinate clause.19(195) a. ébé' ójé ghé'        ì    dá     ólí ényò léé,   òhí vá'rè.

    Circumstantial coincidence frames restrict order of their clauses. Subordinate
ébé'/ébí'...ghe...i must precede its matrix clause. In addition, subject coreference
across subordinate and matrix is disallowed. Disjoint subjects are required.(199) a. ébé' ójé ghé'         ì     dá    ólí ényò léé,   òhí vá'rè.

          ‘Ohi came, just as Oje finished drinking wine.’Coincidence construction information corresponds to distinct constitutents of
émé'/émí' or í yi questions. To query subordinate information, émé'/émí' ‘what’ and

tion. Responses show subordinate clause information alone or in an optional

series. Subordinate extent specifies information assumed to be true and causally
related to a result articulated in the matrix clause. Each element of the extent frame
is necessary for circumstantial extent. Neither ébé'/ébí' and Manner i, ébé'/ébí' and
se, nor i and se is sufficient to render an extent interpretation.20(203) ébé' ó í'            é émàè sé,       ó ò khùà        kpóntón.
      as he PAP.MAN eat food reach he H be.heavy extremely
      ‘Since / As he ate food to such an extent, he was extremely heavy.’When a matrix clause in a circumstantial extent construction shows Perfect Nega-
tion, the subordinate clause can be rendered with English ‘despite.’

         ‘Despite Ohi's fervent pleading, Aleke did not agree to forgive him.’     Circumstantial ébé'/ébí'…i…se constructions restrict aspect, relative tense and
order of clauses. They do not restrict subject coreference.
     Matrix and subordinate clause in circumstantial extent frames restrict aspect
and relative tense. Subordinate extent inflects for Past perfect but not Present per-
fect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(205) a. ébé' ó í'            é émàè sé,      ó ò khùà        kpóntón.

tremely] ‘Since he afterward / still ate so much food, he was extremely heavy’).
     Matrix clauses linked to circumstantial extent are not similarly restricted. They
inflect for imperfect Habitual and Continuous as well as prospective Predictive and
Anticipative. They disallow perfect aspect.(206) a. ébé' ó í'           é émàè sé,        ó ò khùà         kpóntón.

       ‘Despite your maturity, you are still urinating in the house.’   Matrix and subordinate clauses in extent constructions are rigidly ordered.

          he H be.heavy extremely as he PAP.MAN eat food reach
          ‘He was extremely heavy, since he ate so much.’As the construction initial clause, subordinate extent occupies topic position. It
does not occupy focus position, since it is not followed by li/ni focus (*ébé' ó í' é

‘cause’ and indicative khi. The khi complement incorporates erstwhile matrix clause
information. Responses include subordinate clause proposition modified by Tem-
poral Degree gbe rather than an entire ébé'/ébí'...i...se clause. Subordinate clause

Relations of purpose and result are marked as subordinate in multi-clause construc-
tions. Subordinate purpose is expressed by complementizer li with Hortative auxil-
                                              Purposive and resultative relations | 931iary í,23 by aspectualizer preverb òó, or by relational noun ògùì. Result is expressed
by li and Concessive auxiliary re.
       A purpose relation is framed by subjunctive (SUBJ) complementizer li followed
by a right edge high tone subject, Hortative auxiliary í and a predicate with left edge
low tone. The sense is ‘in order to’.24(213) a. ò yé               òkè lí      ó í      mìè éhé        rè fí  ísè.

         he PAP.take mother his prepare charms SUBJ he HOR SUB have money
         ‘He prepared charms with his mother in order to yet have money.’Phrasal expression of purposiveness is conveyed by a predicate constituent includ-
ing Conative òó or by noun phrases headed by ògùì.(214) a. ólí óvbèkhàn lódé vbì èvbò          ó     dà     ényò.

         they PRP.move.to activity wood fetching
         ‘They went to fetch wood / for the activity of fetching wood.’Constructions of purposive result require subjunctive li, a right edge high tone sub-
ject and Concessive re.(215) ólí ómòhè gbé       òhí lí      ó ré' ú.
      the man PRP.beat Ohi SUBJ he PAP.CONC die
      ‘The man beat Ohii until hei died.’14.5.1 Purposive li…íPurpose or intention as a subordinate relation is marked by subjunctive (SUBJ)
complementizer li and Hortative í. Purposives limit aspect, relative tense, linear
order of clauses as well as subject coreference. They correspond to questions framed
by émé'/émí'… ze ‘cause.’
932 | Multi-clause constructions    Purposives marked by li…í restrict aspect and relative tense of matrix and sub-
ordinate clause. Subordinate purposive exhibits irrealis, either subjunctive mood or
negation. For subjunctive, subject exhibits a right edge high tone and left edge syl-
lable of the predicate phrase, if not part of an inherently high tone auxiliary, dis-
plays low tone. A right edge low tone subject or a left edge high tone predicate is
unacceptable. li…í purposives reject perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.(216) a. ò yé             òkè lí     ó í       mìè éhé    rè fí    ísè.

           SUBJ one HOR SUB fetch wine APP him drink
         ‘He feigned coughing so wine would yet get fetched to drink.’When subordinate purposive clause shows Perfect Negation, it requires Conative
aspectualizer òó. Negation without the Conative is unacceptable.(217) a. ò húá         ívbí      óì lá lé'     lí   éó     í ì    ó   gbòò íyàìn.

           SUBJ it NEG CON roost CL LOC wound ASS his
         ‘He chased away the fly so it would not roost on his wound.’As for relative tense, purposives allow Subsequent kpe but not Anterior ke.(218) ó móé'         èhèìn lí    ó í       kpè / *kè míé émàè é.
      he PAP.have lie      SUBJ he HOR SUB ANT find food eat
      ‘He lied in order that he yet find food to eat.’     Matrix clauses linked to purposive subordinates are less restricted. They inflect
for Past and Present perfect, Continuous imperfect, prospective Predictive and An-
ticipative, but not imperfect Habitual.(219) a. ó ré'       ínyó   óì énhén ìkhùnmì lí       ó í       kpè móé éghó'.

        he ANTI sing song SUBJ one HOR take wine APP him drink
        ‘He is about to sing so one should give him wine to drink.’Matrix clauses in li purposives allow relative tense Anterior ke but not kpe.(220) ó ké'     / *kpé' ré ínyó    óì énhén ìkhùnmì

        lí    ó í      kpè móé éghó'.
        SUBJ he HOR SUB have money
     ‘He afterward prepared charms with his mother so he would yet have money.’    When subordinate li clauses are construction initial, they occupy topic position
designated by an intonation downturn or focus position followed by focus li/ni.(221) a. lí    ó í        kpè móé éghó', ó ré'         ínyó   óì énhén ìkhùnmì.

            PF he PAP.take take mother his prepare charm
        ‘It was to still have money that he prepared charms with his mother.’Purposive li constructions restrict constituent clause order based on aspect or nega-
tion. Order is unrestricted when matrix cause inflects for perfect or imperfect.(222) a. lí    éó    í ì      ó      gbòò ívbí      óì, ò ó hùà íyáín shán.

        he C take children his proceed SUBJ curse SC NEG CON kill them
        ‘He is taking his children about so the curse does not kill them.’Two matrix conditions restrict clause order with purposive li. When matrix shows
Perfect Negation, purposive must be construction initial.(223) a. lí     á    í     kpè ré ényò ní áín dà,
          SUBJ one HOR SUB take wine APP him drink

Concessive auxiliary re. Subordinate proposition corresponds to interrogative pro-
noun émé'/émí' in such questions and erstwhile matrix clause material appears in li

      ‘In order that one yet give him wine to drink.’14.5.2 Purposive result li...reA resultative or purposive result relation is conveyed by a subordinate clause with
complementizer li and Concessive simple form re, each being obligatory. Construc-
tions with these morphemes restrict constituent clause aspect, relative tense, linear
order and subject coreference.26(227) a. ólí ómòhè gbé       òhí lí        ó ré'          gúóghó àwè.

         the man PRP.beat Ohi SUBJ he PAP.CONC die
         ‘The man beat Ohii until hei died / was dead.’    Subordinate li re severely limits aspect and relative tense. It requires right edge
high tone subject and Concessive re. Purposive result inflects for Past perfect. It fails
in Present perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(228) ólí ómòhè gbé        òhí lí       ó ré'    gúóghó àwè.

      Oje PAP.ANT SUB beat Ohi SUBJ he PAP.CONC break legs
      ‘Oje afterward beat Ohii until hei broke hisi legs.’     Purposive result construction clauses are strictly ordered. Subordinate clauses
follow matrix clauses. Given this, subordinate clauses never occur in topic or focus
position, the latter marked by li/ni.(231) a. òjè gbé         òhí lí      ó ré'           gúóghó àwè.

          ‘Oje beat Ohi until until the woman ran away.’    Clauses in purposive result constructions correspond to distinct constituents in
questions. Subordinate information corresponds to ébé'/ébí'...i...se in extent ‘how
long’ questions. Responses require the entire construction; subordinate information
alone is insufficient.(234) a. ébé' áléké í'           gbé òhí sé?

          ‘Until he died.’Matrix clauses correspond to ‘why’ questions with émé'/émí'…ze ‘cause’ and a pur-
posive result li…re complement. The latter complement expresses erstwhile subor-
dinate content. Responses require matrix clause information preceded by a focus
position constituent framed as an Associative ísì phrase with òhíó ‘cause’ as head
and a gerundive related to erstwhile matrix predicate as ísì complement.(235) émé' ó zé-í'           lí     òhí ré'        ú?

938 | Multi-clause constructions14.5.3 Conative purposive phrase òóA purposive relation between events is understood when a predicate phrase headed
by Conative aspectualizer follows the complement of a preceding verb. The verb
phrase immediately following Conative òó expresses purposiveness vis-à-vis the
preceding predicate.(236) a. ò lódé vbì èvbò ó             dà     ényò.

          ‘He washed the plates in order to buy wine for the men.’Conative purposive phrases correspond to questions framed by émé'/émí'…ze
‘cause’ and an indicative khi complement expressing erstwhile matrix clause direc-
tional information. Responses require only erstwhile purposive phrase information
in a complete clause containing Conative òó.(238) émé' ó zé-í'           khì ò lódé vbì èvbò?

of’ (Chapter 4, 4.2). It occurs in noun phrases subcategorized for place, either by a
verb or by preposition vbi. Phrases with ògùì follow verbs of motion, although not all
directional motion verbs accept ògùì phrases. In particular, motion verbs that entail
a relation of achievement or arrival (e.g. o ‘enter’) relative to place reject ògùì.(239) a. yàn yé              ógúí     éràn / ógúí     ódàn.
          they PRP.move.to activity wood activity wrestling

          they PRP.enter LOC activity yam eating
          ‘They entered in order to engage the activity of yam eating.’Constituents following ògùì are either simple nouns or gerundives referring to cul-
tural activities, e.g. fetching wood, hunting for mushrooms, drinking palm wine.(240) a. yàn yé             ógúí    éràn.

         they PAP.move.to activity wine drinking
         ‘They went to drink wine.’    Purposive ògùì phrases correspond to two question types. Interrogatives corre-
sponding to ògùì phrase content are framed by émé'/émí'…ze ‘cause’ and an indica-
tive khi complement. Within the khi complement, a deictic locative pronoun as-
sumes erstwhile position of the ògùì phrase. Acceptable responses include a
sentence containing an ògùì phrase, an ògùì phrase itself or a sentence with erst-
while gerundive constituents in construction with the Conative preverb.(241) a. émé' ó zé-í'          khì yàn yé               èvbò?

‘where.’ Responses to ébé'/ébí' require an ògùì phrase. They do not allow a gerun-
dive phrase or a simple noun phrase.(242) a. ébé' yán yé'-ì?

Multi-clause constructions code an exceptive relation as subordinate with comple-
mentizer sòkpén ‘except’ and a khi complement. Subordinate sòkpén expresses an
exception relation to a preceding assertion. sòkpén takes neither subjunctive li nor
conditional si complements.27(243) òjè húnmé         ósèn    sòkpén khì ò dá        gbé.

clause order and cross clause subject coreference. Exceptive clauses do not corre-
spond to any direct question. Subordinate sòkpén minimally constrains aspect and
relative tense. It inflects for Present perfect or imperfect Habitual but not Past per-
fect, Continuous or either prospective.(244) a. òjè húnmé            ósèn sòkpén khì ò dá        gbé'.

      the woman PRED do well except IND she NEG NABI be.tall
      ‘The woman will do well except that she is not in the least tall.’Subordinate sòkpén rejects relative tense ke and kpe (*áléké ú' lèsèn sòkpén khí ó ké'
/ kpé' dá ényò [Aleke PAP.do well except IND she PAP.ANT SUB drink wine] ‘Aleke
did well except that she afterward / still drank wine’).
    Matrix clauses with sòkpén partially limit aspect and relative tense. They inflect
for Past and Present perfect, imperfect Habitual and prospective Predictive. They
reject imperfect Continuous or prospective Anticipative.(246) a. ólí ókpósó ú'      lèsèn sòkpén khí ó ì            zèzé dà.

      Aleke PAP.ANT SUB do well except IND she NEG NABI be.tall
      ‘Aleke afterward did well except that she was not a bit tall.’    Constructions with sòkpén strictly order constituents. A sòkpén clause never
precedes its matrix. It is consistently construction final.(248) a. ólí óvbèkhàn húnmé            ósèn sòkpén khí ó ò ràá.

          ‘Aleke will do well except that Oje is not in the least tall.’14.7 Causal relations
Causal and quasi-causal relations are marked as subordinate in multi-clause con-
structions. A causal relation between events is framed by nominal òhíó ‘reason,
cause’ and a following complement marked by either indicative khi or subjunctive li.
Conditional si never appears with òhíó.(250) a. òhíó khí ólí ómòhè dé             ìmátó lì ògbòn, ò ó gbé.

         cause SUBJ Ohi kill rat APP him the child SC C cry
         ‘Because Ohi intended to kill a rat for him, the child is crying.’Nominal òhíó also heads Associative ísì phrases expressing causation.
                                                                  Causal relations | 943(251) ò ré           òhíó ísì òhí gbé óókhò.

pect and relative tense but not clause order or cross clause subject coreference.(253) ólí ómòhè ò ó gbé òhíó khì ò dé                 ìmátó lì ògbòn.

      the man SC C dance IND he PRP.buy car            R new
      ‘The mani is dancing for hei bought a new car.’When òhíó is omitted, matrix clauses allow Resultative auxiliary za. Otherwise they
do not permit za.(255) ó zá'          kókó éráín khì ò ló         yà nyé      émàè.
      he PAP.RES set fire IND he ANTI IG prepare food
      ‘As a result, he started a fire for he wanted to prepare food.’    Subordinate òhíó khi clauses restrict aspect and relative tense. They inflect for
Present perfect, Continuous and Anticipative. They reject Past perfect, imperfect
Habitual and prospective Predictive.

      cause IND she PRP.ANT kill rat APP him the child SC C dance
      ‘Because she afterward killed a rat for him, the child is dancing.’     Matrix clauses linked to òhíó khi severely restrict aspect and relative tense. They
inflect for imperfect but not perfect. Habitual only occurs when òhíó khi appears
construction initially in focus position marked by li/ni.(258) a. ólí ómò ò ó vìé òhíó khì ò ó zàwò ínyó                  óì.

combination with Ingressive preverb ya. They never inflect with the Predictive and
Ingressive ya.(259) a. ólí ómò ló        yà víé òhíó khì òhí gbé'          ólí ófè.

         ‘The child will start crying because Ohi killed the rat.’Matrix clauses in òhíó constructions disallow relative tense Anterior ke and Subse-
quent kpe.

       the child SC C ANT SUB cry cause IND he C see mother his
       ‘The child is afterward / still crying because he sees his mother.’    Causal òhíó khi does not restrict order of matrix and subordinate clauses. When
òhíó khi occurs construction initially, it occupies either topic or focus position. In
focus position, the òhíó khi clause is immediately followed by li/ni and its matrix
clause shows obligatory re ‘take’ in series. When in topic position, the òhíó khi
clause displays an intonation downturn and no re in the matrix clause.29(261) a. òhíó khì ò ó zàwò ínyó            óì lí ó ò ré         vìé.

tions framed by ze ‘cause’ and a khi complement. The latter expresses erstwhile
matrix clause information. Responses are shaped by the subordinate proposition,
marked or unmarked by òhíó khi.(263) émé' ó zé-í'          khí ó ì  è émà?

946 | Multi-clause constructions14.7.2 Subjunctive causal òhíó li…íA distinct causal frame consists of òhíó and its nominal complement marked by
subjunctive li and Hortative í. Causal òhíó li…í severely constrains aspect, relative
tense, cross clause subject coreference and linear order of construction clauses.
     As with purposive li…í (Chapter 14, 14.5.1), òhíó li…í exhibits a unique pattern
vis-à-vis modality and subject shape. Subjunctive causal modality consists of an
overt deontic Hortative í with pronominal subjects but a covert í with lexical sub-
jects. Either instance shows a right edge high tone subject and a low tone left edge
predicate phrase. Subordinate causal òhíó li…í clauses do not inflect for perfect,

in focus position. Indeed, èmìdí khi clauses, like òhíó clauses, occur in focus or topic
position. In focus, the èmìdí khi clause is immediately followed by li/ni and a matrix
clause with verb re ‘take’ in series. As topic, the èmìdí khi clause terminates in an
intonation downturn, but neither li/ni nor re occurs in the matrix clause.(275) a. èmìdí khí òhí ló        gbè ófè lí ólí ómó ó ò ré          vìé.

950 | Multi-clause constructionsIn discourse, èmìdí khi clauses do not correspond to question constituents. Clauses
headed by èmìdí, for example, do not correspond to questions framed by émé'/émí',

headed by either of the nominals òhíó or èrímí. The resulting constructions differ
somewhat in their grammatical properties.
     Associative ísì phrases with òhíó as head express causal (because) or benefac-
tive (for sake of) notions. They do so as direct objects of verb re ‘use, take’ in series.(279) a. òjè ré         òhíó ísì òhí gbé óókhò.

       ‘The man afterward / still killed a chicken because of Ohi.’    Causal òhíó headed Associative ísì phrases with a pronoun or a common noun
complement occur in focus position. The accompanying matrix clause shows verb re
‘take’ or Resultative preverb za. òhíó phrases never occupy topic position or occur
clause finally.(282) a. òhíó ísì óáín lí òhí ré'             nwú èkpèn dín.

         cause ASS that PF Ohi PAP.RES take leopard tie
         ‘It was for the sake of that one that Ohi tied up a leopard.’Associative òhíó headed phrases answer ‘why’ questions. Complex in nature, the
question is framed by Associative ísì with òhíó as head and a complement requiring
émé'/émí', ze ‘cause’ and an indicative khi clause. Within the khi complement occurs
u ‘do’ followed by distal manner-demonstrative ìyó. Responses require òhíó associa-
tive phrases, not simple noun phrases.(283) a. òhíó ísì émé' ó zé-í'              khì ò ú   ìyó?

         cause ASS the woman             the woman
         ‘Because of the woman.’         ‘The woman.’    A related construction is framed by an associative phrase headed by nominal
èrímí that expresses a benefactive meaning. èrímí phrases are restricted to focus
position and its li/ni marker. A following matrix clause shows verb re ‘take’ in series.
Associative èrímí phrases never occupy topic position or occur in clause final posi-
tion.31(284) a. èrímí ísì ólì òkpòsò lí òhí ré'             vàré.

         ‘It was on my behalf / for my sake that he went to Afuze.’Associative èrímí phrases with benefactive significance fail to correspond to ques-
tion constituents.32 For instance, complements of èrímí do not correspond to
émé'/émí' in ‘why’ questions with ze ‘cause’ and a khi complement containing erst-
while matrix clause information.33(285) *èrímí ísì émé' ó zé-í'             khì ò yé       áfúzé'?

Relations of conjunction and disjunction are expressed in multi-clause construc-
tions. Conjoined clauses are marked as contrastive by one form while conjoined
complements are so marked by another. Disjunction is marked in each clause. Con-
struction markers impose polarity on clause union. Although contrastive and dis-
junctive forms exist, there is no marker for clause conjunction (e.g. ‘and’).","[943, 944, 945, 946, 947, 948, 949, 950, 951, 952, 953, 954, 955, 956, 957, 958, 959, 960, 961, 962, 963, 964, 965, 966, 967, 968, 969, 970, 971, 972, 973, 974, 975, 976, 977, 978]"

across the word. Both transitive and intransitive verbs occur as ú-mi gerundives.
     The ú-mi circumfix attaches to activity, change of state and stative verbs with
differential semantic effect. It converts intransitive and transitive activity verbs to
nominals denoting actions with the sense ‘human activity characterized by VERB.’úlàmí ‘running’: la ‘to run’

to linear order, modifier compatibility and grammatical relation type. Transitive
verbs that assume a gerundive shape follow their direct object arguments. The direct
object never follows the gerund (*úèmí éhéén ‘eating fish’).

     fish eating PAP.cause me illness
     ‘Eating fish has made me ill.’Gerundives never occur as head of an Associative ísì phrase whose complement (e.g.
èhèèn) bears a direct object relation (*úèmí ísì èhèèn zé mé èmìànmì [eating ASS fish
cause me illness] ‘The eating of fish made me ill’). When gerundive forms follow
Associative ísì, the phrase shows a purposive ‘for’ interpretation.(39) ò gbá-ló        émí ísì úgbèmí.
     he PRP.tie-DS thing ASS dancing
     ‘He put on his costume for the purpose of dancing.’     Noun phrase arguments of transitive gerundives do not accept nominal modifi-
ers. For instance, gerundive constructions take neither definite predeterminer ólí
(*ólí émá úèmí zé' mé èmìànmì [the yam eating PAP.cause me illness] ‘The yam eat-
ing made me ill’) nor kindred postdeterminer élìyó (*émá élìyó úèmí zé' mé èmìànmì
[yam that.kind eating PAP.cause me illness] ‘Eating yam of that kind made me ill’).
     Complement position preceding a gerundive form is limited to direct object ar-
guments. Even when framed by Locative vbi or Associative ísì, gerundive comple-
ment position rejects a locative adjunct: íwé or vbì ìwè in (*íwé úgbèmí / úgbèmí vbì
ìwè zé ókpósó ghònghòn [house dancing / dancing LOC house PRP.allow woman

PRP.allow village be.happy] ‘The chief's drinking made the village happy’).
     Gerundive phrases are not restricted to core grammatical relations subject and
direct object. They appear as objects of locative preposition vbi.(40) ólí ómòhè béé         vbí émáé úèmí.

exhibit an optional split structure for a limited number of verbs. Intransitive verb
mianme ‘be difficult’ accepts an argument gerundive noun phrase as grammatical
subject. It also shows a split gerundive in which the argument precedes mianme and
the gerundive follows in direct object position. The argument requires obligatory
modification (definite predeterminer ólí). Reversing constituent order is unaccepta-
ble; the gerundive never precedes mianme and its argument never follows (*úhìànmí
ó ò mìànmé órán [cutting SC H be.difficult wood] ‘Cutting wood is difficult’).(42) a. órán úhìànmí ó ò mìànmé.

multiple verb roots that otherwise occur as serial verb sequences or to verb stems
that incorporate a suffix. These lexemes reflect four semantic classes: conditions,
entities, instruments and places.","[65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"

imperfect or Anticipative prospective.(14) a. ómóhé lí ó shén'      émà lí     ònwìmè fí        ólí áwá údò.

        man R he PRED fetch water move.to farmer            PRP.came
        ‘The man who will fetch water for the farmer came.’Relative clauses restrict auxiliary constituents. While they accept epistemic Hypo-
thetical kha, they disallow all epistemic forms (Deductive za, Resultative za, Certain-
tive ma, Dubitative vba and bia, and Concessive rere). Relative clauses also reject
deontic Hortative í.(15) ómóhé lí ó khà      sá     àmè yé          ònwìmè lá        lé'.

Grammatical relations that undergo relativization, i.e. that correspond to head noun
of the relative clause, include subject, direct object, indirect object, locative, posses-
sor and adjunct. Of these, subject and possessor require an obligatory resumptive,
                                                                 Determiners | 225personal pronoun in the corresponding relative clause position, as does the first
object in double object complements. Remaining grammatical relations (direct ob-
ject, indirect object, locative and adjunct) show a gap or zero pronoun in the em-
bedded relative clause.
     When relativized, noun phrase positions expressing subject, possessor and first
object in a double object complement require a resumptive pronoun. When a singu-
lar subject constituent relativizes, its position in the embedded relative clause is
marked by an obligatory nominative pronoun (e.g. ó). When a plural subject relativ-
izes, its position requires a plural nominative pronoun (e.g. é). Thus number agree-
ment must obtain between resumptive pronoun and relative clause head (ákhé ~ ó
and ékhé ~ é).(18) a. ákhé ísì ójé lí ó gbé'           á húnmé'   ósèn.

        pots ASS Oje R they PAP.break CS PAP.be.good beauty
        ‘Oje's pots which broke were beautiful.’When a possessor constituent following Associative ísì relativizes, its position in the
embedded clause is assumed by a genitive pronoun (e.g. òí). A zero pronoun in the
relativized position is unacceptable.(19) ókpósó lí éghó' ísì òí rì       vbí ùgín shén'      émà.
     woman R money ASS her PRP.be LOC basket PAP.sell yam
     ‘The woman whose money was in the basket sold yam.’When a possessor constituent in an unmarked associative phrase relativizes, its
position in the relative clause is taken by an accusative pronoun (e.g. óí).(20) ómóhé lí érá    óí gbé'       ólí ófè ó           vbì ìwè.
     man R father his PAP.kill the rat PRP.enter LOC house
     ‘The man whose father killed the rat entered the house.’When an external possessor relativizes, i.e. a possessor that precedes its possessum,

     woman R the man PAP.break her pot CS PAP.fall-F
     ‘The woman whose pot the man broke fell.’
226 | Noun modifiersWhen the first (ókpósó ‘woman’) of two objects in a double object complement (fí ólí
ókpósó údò ‘hit the woman with a stone’) relativizes, its position in the embedded
relative clause requires an accusative pronoun (e.g. óí).(22) òlólò nwú      émà lí    ókpósó lí ójé fí'     óí údò.
     Ololo PRP.take yam APP woman R Oje PAP.hit her stone
     ‘Ololo gave yam to the woman whom Oje hit with a stone.’When the second object (údó) in a double object complement relativizes, a zero
pronoun assumes its position following the first object.(23) òlólò fí          ólí údó lí yán fí'           ólí ókpósó fí à.
     Ololo PRP.throw the stone R they PAP.hit the woman propel CS
     ‘Ololo threw away the stone that they hit the woman with.’     Grammatical relations other than subject, possessor and first object in a double
object complement exhibit a contrasting strategy under relativization. When any of
the relations direct object, indirect object, locative, or adverbial adjunct relativizes,
a zero pronoun occupies its position in the embedded clause. Affected are direct
object positions defined by transitive verbs in simple predicates (ze in ólí ónwímé zé'
ìwè ‘The farmer built a house’), in series (re and ye in ónwímé ré' ólí ómóhé yé ésì òjè
‘A farmer took the man to Oje’s place’), or in construction with a postverbal particle

        house R the man PAP.sell APP farmer PRP.collapse-F
        ‘The house which the man sold to the farmer collapsed.’When indirect object position marked by Applicative li/ni relativizes (ólí ókpósó
nwú' émà lí ólí ómòhè ‘The woman gave yam to the man’; ólí ómóhé shén' ébè lí ólì
òkpòsò ‘The man sold the book to the woman’), it is designated by a zero pronoun.

        he PAP.receive woman R Oje PAP.sell book APP cloth
        ‘He received cloth from a woman whom Oje sold a book to.’When noun phrases serving as locative adjuncts or locative arguments marked by
preposition vbi relativize, their position in the embedded clause is assumed by a
zero pronoun. However, when one relativizes locative adjuncts (e.g. ìwè in ò ó là vbí
ìwè ‘He is running in the house’), the embedded clause obligatorily attracts verb za
in series (Chapter 6. 6.2).(26) íwé lí ó zá'             là gbá-ì.
     house R he PAP.be.loc run PRP.be.big-F
     ‘The house in which he ran was big.’In contrast is the relativization of a locative argument (e.g. ìwè in ó lá ó vbì ìwè ‘He
ran into the house’). When a locative argument relativizes, za is disallowed in series.
As well, neither the relative clause nor its head position retains preposition vbi.(27) íwé    lí ó lá'         ò    gbá-ì.
     house R he PAP.run enter PRP.be.big-F
     ‘The house that he ran into was big.’When a time adjunct (e.g. ólí édè in ólí ómóhé fí' ólí áwá údó vbí ólí édè ‘The man hit
the dog with a stone on the day’) relativizes, its position in the embedded relative
shows a zero pronoun.29(28) édé lí ólí ómóhé fí'        ólí áwá údó ké'           tèè.
     day R the man PAP.hit the dog stone PAP.ANT be.long
     ‘The day when the man hit the dog with a stone was now long past.’4.3.3.4.3     Relative clause and postdeterminers
Lexically headed relative clauses co-occur with all nominal modifier categories,
although forms within categories may be constrained. Relative clauses combine
with definite article ólí/élí under discourse conditions where the speaker wishes to
re-establish shared knowledge with the hearer about the referent of the relativized
nominal. Without a strong discourse condition, speakers tend not to use the definite
article with a relative clause.

     the woman woman R she PAP.kill the rat PRP.run depart
     ‘The woman / A woman who killed the rat ran away.’Relative clauses co-occur with demonstrative modifiers, although distinct order
patterns characterize deictic and contrastive forms. Deictic demonstratives, distal
áìn and proximal nà, follow a relative clause. They do not immediately follow the
head noun and precede the relative clause.(30) a. ólí ókpósó lí ó gbé'       ófé áìn lá      lé'.

        the woman R she PAP.kill rat this PAP.run depart
        ‘This woman who killed a rat ran away.’Contrastive demonstrative nóì, on the other hand, immediately follows either the
head noun or the entire relative clause.(31) a. ókpósó nóí lí ó gbé'        ófè lá        lé'.
        woman next R she PAP.kill rat PRP.run depart

ciative ísì complements.(32) íwé     ísì òhí lí ólí ómóhé lá'        ò     gbá-ì.

(e.g. èvèvá), and ordinal numerals (e.g. lí ózèvà) precede a li marked relative clause,
whereas distributive numerals, e.g. èvéèvá do not.(34) a. élí ívbèkhàn èvá lí é      gbé'      ólí ófè váré'.

         the youths    two.each R they PAP.kill rat PRP.come
         ‘The two-two youths who killed rats have come.’Also constrained with relative clause is numeral òkpá ‘one.’ It fails to occur with a

      youth     one R he PAP.kill the rat PRP.come
      ‘One youth who killed the rat came.’Relative clauses are more constrained in combination with quantifiers and kindred
modifiers. Collective universal quantifier èrèmé follows the head noun and precedes
a li marked relative clause. The distributive universal quantifier òdóòdé fails to co-
occur with a relative clause constituent.(36) a. íwé     èrèmé lí ólí ómóhé lá'        ò     gbá-ì.

head noun (N). Six categories are evident: genitive (GEN), adjectival (ADJ), kindred
(KIND), number (NUM), relative clause (RC) and demonstrative (DEM). Relative to
one another, they most often exhibit behavior consistent with Schema A:                      N    GEN ADJ KIND NUM RC DEMA single NP headed by noun íkpùn ‘cloths’ illustrates this schema.íkpún ísì ójé lí óbín' élìyó           èvá lí ónwímé shén-í'       áìn

precedes it in a complex classifying nominal phrase (úgógó úvbí ákhè [remains.of DIM pot] ‘broken
remains of a small pot’ but not *úvbí úgógó ákhè [DIM remnant.of pot]). The úgógó úvbí combination
never accepts a following expletive pronoun (*úgógó úvbí óì [remains.of DIM it] ‘broken remains of

 A construction with a Comitative bíì phrase conveys simultaneous occurrence of one event and an
implicit concessive condition. In each instance, bíì’s complement shows a nominal head followed
by a locative vbi phrase. Such bíì phrase constructions are confined to Continuous aspect. They
reject Past and Present perfect, imperfect Habitual and prospective aspect.

    b. ò ó híó bíì ékéín vbí égbè.
       she C weed COM belly LOC body
       ‘She is weeding even though she is pregnant.’10
  Matrix clauses in ke constructions do not accept Concessive auxiliary re. However, they allow
discourse sensitive Resultative za.(ii) a. *òjè kéè        tá     étà   léé, ó ré'             díá vbì èkpètè.

         Oje PRP.ANT speak words TEMP he PAP.RES sit LOC stool
         ‘After Oje had already spoken, he as a result sat in the stool.’11
  Addition of Punctual ghe to matrix rather than subordinate clause leads to a different temporal
relation that reduces the temporal interval between matrix event and utterance reference time.
Presence of ghe alone in the matrix clause does not induce immediate succession.(i) ò kéè          é émàè léé, ó ghé'             là lé.
    he PRP.ANT ea t food TEMP he PAP.PCT run depart
    ‘After he finished eating, he just ran away.’Moreover, addition of ghe to a subordinate clause with ke requires cross clause subject coreference.
Disjoint subjects would then be unacceptable.(ii) *ólí ómòhè kéè          ghé híán óràn léé, ólí ókpósó ú'-ì.
      the man PRP.ANT PCT cut wood TEMP the woman PAP.die-F
      ‘Just after he finished cutting wood, the woman died.’12
  When kpe clauses include preverb ìyó ‘that way’ and therefore link to preceding discourse, the
preferred position of kpe’s clause is construction initial.(i) a. ójé kpé'       íyó' tá     étà,     ò ríé           úvbíághàè léé.
        Oje PAP.SUB DMD speak words he PRP.sharpen knife             TEMP

        Oje PRP.sharpen knife          TEMP he PAP.SUB DMD speak words
        ‘The man already sharpened his knife before he spoke that way.’13
     The lack of a shared participant between kpe construction clauses leads to ungrammaticality.(i) * ólí ómóhé ó'         vbì ìwè, ólì òkpòsò kpé          míé òhí.

‘reach’ leads to an acceptable subordinate kpe marked clause. Linear order between the resulting
clauses is not restricted.(ii) a. *òjè gbé       ólí ófè léé, òhí kpé'           díànré.
         Oje PRP.kill the rat TEMP Ohi PAP.SUB come.out

         Oje PRP.kill the rat TEMP it PAP.SUB reach IND Ohi PAP.come.out
         ‘Oje finished killing the rat, before it happened that Ohi came out.’14
  One might interpret these ghe constructions (as well as that of some other temporal relations) as
simply juxtaposition of two clauses with no grammatical marking of subordination. Such an analy-
sis, however, fails to recognize the dual functionality of preverbs like ghe, which have temporal
significance, and the seemingly parallel dual functionality of relative tense auxiliaries ke and kpe.
Each has a common sense that adjusts for matrix or subordinate clause status.15
     bi also occurs as a preposition in simile phrases, where its vowel [ i ] elides.","[985, 986, 987]"
"4.3.3.1.1    Possession ísì / ésì
Two forms of the Associative exist: ésì and ísì. Each occurs under distinct semantic
conditions. ésì is restricted to expressions of temporary location, whereas ísì ex-
presses more permanent location along with alienable and inalienable possession,
partitive and spatial orientation, social collectives, and purposive relations.
    ísì framed noun phrases express alienable and inalienable relations between
possessum and possessor, with possessum preceding ísì. Possessor position permits
various noun types. For instance, it accepts proper names (òjè).úkpún ísì òjè                          ùgín ísì òjè

ellipsis (*úkpún ísì).ísì òjè                                ísì éwè

formly. Omission of ísì is controlled by possessor number and person. First and third
person pronouns act uniformly while second person reveals a split distribution.
Singular èé behaves like third person and plural àvbá like first person. Under condi-
tions of ísì omission, the possessor pronoun assumes accusative rather than genitive
form (Chapter 5, 5.3).
    A subclass of alienable possession expressing temporary/permanent place is
conveyed by contrasting Associative markers ísì and ésì.11 Temporary occupation of
a dwelling is designated by ésì. Possessum under this condition can be realized as
place noun ìwè ‘house, hut, dwelling.’ Most other place place nouns are disallowed

‘Oje's’                                  ‘the woman’s’     Linear order of related possessor and possessum is controlled by argument rela-
tion (direct object and locative complement) and verb type (physical change of loca-
tion/material state vs cognition). Possessors may be internal (follow) or external
(precede) to their possessa constituent. When external, ísì fails to appear, posses-
sors undergo high tone spread and possessors assume accusative form.
     In direct object or locative complements of change of state or change of location
verbs, possessors follow or precede possessa. When a disjoint condition, i.e. separa-
tion, exists between possessor and possessum, possessor (òjè) follows possessum
and Associative ísì. The possessor is assumed to be less fully affected by verb event,
if affected at all.

fully affected by verb event.(3) a. ólì òkpòsò tóó      ójé úkpùn á.

tions, possessor precedes or follows possessum according to intended meaning:
disjoint and partially affected vs conjoint and holistically affected.(4) a. ólì òkpòsò nwú        áwé ísì óókhò ó vbì èràìn.

of possessor and possessum, possessum precedes ísì and possessor. Conjoint con-
strual of these events in the real world is difficult to imagine and so a possessor
possessum order is unacceptable.

dition, is revealed by constrasting construal of an inalienable possession relation.
As a simple predicate, hian ‘cut’ normally construes not only a body-part possessum
as attached to possessor but also a possessor as affected. Under these normal condi-
tions possessor precedes possessum.(6) ólí ómòhè híán      ójé àwè / *áwé ísì òjè.
    the man PRP.cut Oje legs       legs ASS Oje
    ‘The man cut Oje's legs.’The verb hian and a body part direct object also occur as one element of a complex
predicate that incorporates Change of State particle a, which confirms a telic end
state. As a consequence, there is no further cutting of the body part. Since this end
state assumes the existence of a disjoint relation between possessor and possessum,
possessum precedes possessor with ísì interposed.(7)   ólí ómòhè híán       áwé ísì òjè á / *híán ójé àwè á.
      the man PRP.cut legs ASS Oje CS       cut Oje legs CS
      ‘The man cut the legs off from Oje.’    Position of possessor relative to possessum is constrained by several additional
factors including grammatical relation and verb type. Although external possessors
occur in direct object and locative argument positions under appropriate pragmatic
conditions, they never occur in subject position. As well, they never occur in the
discourse defined positions of topic, focus or right dislocated position.(8) úkpún ísì òjè / *ójé úkpùn tóó          á'.

verbs that do not entail a change of state or location disallow external possessors in
direct object position. The activity verb da ‘drink’ disallows an external possessor.(10) ólí ómòhè dá         ényó ísì òjè / *ójé ényò.

Associative ísì phrases convey a relation of spatial orientation. Orientation nouns
precede ísì and locative reference point nouns follow ísì. For one subclass of orienta-
tion terms, many derived from body-part terms, ísì is obligatory. Absence of ísì is
ungrammatical (*ísáó ìwè ‘front of house,’ *éhón úkpódè ‘edge of the road’).ísáó ísì ìwè                            éhón ísì úkpódè

constrained. When reference point position shows an animate noun, ísì is obligatory
(*úókhó ólí ómòhè ‘back of the man,’ *égbé éwè ‘near the goat,’ *ésèsé élí árèò
‘among the idols’). Resulting associative phrases with body part terms preceding ísì
are ambiguous between spatial orientation and a possession relation, where posses-

Associative ísì phrases articulate a semantic relation of purpose between an instru-
ment and an affected entity. Instrument precedes affected entity, with ísì interposed.
For one subclass of constructions, ísì is obligatory (*ífí áfìánmì ‘bird trap,’ *ébé
ùgbèkhòkhò ‘leaf wound cure’).ífì    ísì áfìánmì                      ébé ísì úgbèkhòkhò

‘trap for a bird / bird trap’           ‘leaf for wound cure’For another subclass, too, ísì is obligatory. However, the resulting phrases show
related compounds framed by instrument and affected entity nouns. For these com-
pounds, the purposive interpretation is no longer available, giving way to a non-
purposive, maximum quantity interpretation.

Kin relation phrases are unmarked by Associative ísì and reflect two classes. Kinship
is articulated as a blood or nonblood relation relative to “ego” expressed as animate
possessor. The kin term manifests high tone spread and precedes possessor.
     Kin constituent position accepts nouns differing as to grammatical number and
syntactic distribution. One class is illustrated by kin terms expressing parental and
nonparental relations. Parental relation terms (ínyó, érá) do not inflect for grammat-
ical number.

Attributive complements within complex noun phrases show marked and unmarked
patterns. Marked attributives are signaled by Relator li. It follows a head noun,
which undergoes high tone spread, and precedes an attributive complement. li
complements include abstract nominals, adjectives, nominalized stative verbs, and
deictic pronouns. Unmarked attributives lack Relator li and express distributive and
quantitative meanings in contrast to li marked collective and size meanings.","[219, 220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240]"
"2.1.1 Noun inflectionEmai evinces a remnant gender system of number bearing prefixes attached to nom-
inal roots. Aspects of this system are also evident in prefixes attached to postnomi-
nal modifiers as well as pronouns expressing varying syntactic functions.
     Number inflection determines the shape of some nominal and modifier stems.
For a limited set of nominal roots belonging to human, animate and inanimate clas-
ses as well as body-part locus and abstractions, a number contrast is marked by
vowel prefixes. There is a tendency for singular to be realized by back, mid vowels
(o- and o-) and plural by front, non-low vowels (i-, e-, e-). It is only the mid low vow-
el (a-) that is used for singular and plural marking. Tone of the prefixal pair does not
correlate with number; nor does it correlate with gender.
     Overt number marking leading to noun class pairs and thus genders is not com-
prehensive in Emai. The number of nouns in each remnant gender is variable, some
exhibiting only a single root. And in contrast to gender systems of the Bantu type
found in other parts of Africa, no root participates in more than one noun class pair.

      Each Emai prefix pair (i.e. gender) correlates to some extent with semantic enti-
ties that fall within the classes human, animate, inanimate, abstract and/or locus.
Based on their semantic profiles, few remnant genders reflect a single identifiable
semantic class. Of Emai’s 11 genders, all with mid back vowels designating singular
(i.e. o- ~ i-, o- ~ e-, o- ~ e-, o- ~ i-) exhibit human nouns except o- ~ a-; it shows body-
part items. The gender u- ~ i- is the most clearly non-human, since it reveals all clas-
ses except human. For the most part, common nouns for flora and fauna in these
gender classes reflect a generic or basic level of abstraction. Several classes identify-
ing fauna, moreover, identify entities reflective of a pastoral lifestyle (e.g. sheep,
cow and goat), despite the fact that such a lifestyle is incompatible with the current
ecological environment of the Emai. In addition, Emai gender classes tend not to
include root forms that reflect an agricultural lifestyle (e.g yam, maize and beans).
An overall impression of Emai gender is available in Table 3, which pairs the 11 gen-
ders with each of five semantic classes.
      Based on Table 3 and the list of noun forms in each gender, we identify the se-
mantic character of Emai gender classes. The a- ~ e- gender incorporates animate
and inanimate entities: ákhè, ékhè ‘ceramic pot,’ áwà, éwà ‘dog.’ The a- ~ i- gender
subsumes human, animate and inanimate roots with recognizeable social values.
This gender applies to humans denoting lifecycle stages, birds at both the unique
beginner and mid taxonomic levels and an inanimate stem involving a complex
word form whose derivational history is no longer transparent: ágèlè, ígèlè ‘pubes-
cent boy’, àlèkè, ìlèkè ‘pubescent female,’ áfìánmì, ífìánmì ‘bird,’ ávbé'ì, ívbé'ì ‘vil-
lage weaver bird,’ ágádágòdò, ìgádágòdò ‘padlock.’
                                                         Inflectional morphology | 23     Two genders are each limited to a single root denoting a domesticated animal
type. In the e- ~ i- gender there is émèlá, ímèlá ‘cow’. And the e- ~ e- gender has one
root: éwè, éwè ‘goat.’
     Body part extremities are identified by the o- ~ a- gender: óbò, ábò ‘hand, fore-
leg,’ òè, àwè ‘foot, hind leg.’ The o- ~ e- gender includes human, animate, inanimate
and locus noun roots. It has roots for mid level rodent, unique beginner and socially
recognized humans as well as roots for inanimates, tree and calabash bowl, as well
as an animal body-part extremity: ófè, éfè ‘rodent, rat,’ ótù, étù ‘person, people,’
óìbó, éìbó ‘whiteman,’ óràn, éràn ‘tree, wood, stick,’ òkpàn, èkpàn ‘calabash bowl,’
óhìà, éhìà ‘hoof, claw.’ Limited to roots denoting animate nouns and socially recog-
nized humans is the o- ~ i- gender. It includes root forms for animals that are wild
(bush) or domesticated, for the human female, offspring and blood relative, and for
social roles antagonistic to societal welfare or reflective of traditional Emai occupa-
tions: óvbèè, ívbèè ‘monkey,’ óghòóghò, íghòóghò ‘female sheep,’ òkpòsò, ìkpòsò
‘woman, female,’ ómìòò, ímìòò ‘blood relative,’ òrúán, ìrúán ‘in-law,’ óghìàn, íghìàn
‘enemy,’ óhùà, íhùà ‘hunter.’
     The o- ~ e- gender prefixes attach primarily to human root forms, marriage
roles, socially defined positions at the fringe of human society, animate roots for
domestic fowl as well as insects and an abstract root with negative value: ódòn,
édòn ‘husband,’ óhà, éhà ‘wife,’ óìà, éèà ‘person, human being,’ ómèmè, émèmè
‘lunatic, madman,’ ódíòn, édíòn ‘elder,’ óbò, ébò ‘oraclist, diviner,’ òkhòì, èkhòì
‘worm,’ óókhò, éókhò ‘fowl, hen,’ òbè, èbè ‘bad, evil.’ A single abstract root with
positive value denotation defines o- ~ e-: òsèn, èsèn ‘goodness, good.’ In the o- ~ i-
gender one finds roots identifying human social roles in addition to affixal forms
reflecting nominalization (prefix added to a verb root) and synthetic compounds
(prefix added to verb plus noun). This gender also has root forms denoting male and
female humans in various life cycle stages as well as social roles and occupations:
òmòhè, ìmòhè ‘man,’ óvbèkhàn, ívbèkhàn ‘unmarried youth,’ òvíén, ìvíén ‘slave,
bonded one,’ òíé'n, ìíé'n ‘co-wife, female rival, ómòò, ímòò ‘friend, companion,’
ògbàmá , ìgbàmá ‘post pubescent male,’ óèjè, íèjè ‘chief, titled man,’ ózèwàìn,
ízèwàìn ‘wiseman, advisor, sage,’ ònwìmè, ìnwìmè ‘farmer,’ òlìmè, ìlìmè ‘farmer,’
òzètò, ìzètò ‘barber,’ óhànèvbòò, íhànèvbòò ‘judge,mediator’, ódùèkìn, ídùèkìn ‘mer-
chant, trader,’ òvìnèbè, ìvìnèbè ‘scribe, writer,’ òdènyò, ìdènyò ‘drunkard,’ òyèhón,
ìyèhón ‘deaf person,’ òrùènó, ìrùènó ‘blind person,’ óré', íré' ‘stranger, visitor.’
     The u- ~ i- gender hosts the largest number of noun roots. This gender incorpo-
rates primarily inanimate and animate roots with some from body-part locus. It has
forms denoting animal body parts, insects, artifacts and an abstract noun recogniz-
ing a basic temporal distinction: ùbèlè, ìbèlè ‘calabash, gourd,’ úgbàn, ígbàn ‘blade
of grass,’ úgùà, ígùà ‘bone joint,’ úkpàsánmì, íkpàsánmì ‘cane,’ úkpà, íkpà ‘seed,’

      Within Emai’s grammatical system, agreement or concord linked to gender is no
longer functional. Perfect aspect and prospective aspect evince no morphological
agreement marking. However, a remnant agreement system is evident in imperfect
aspect, where continuous and habitual morphemes are distinguished by tone.
      Continuous aspect in the third person is expressed by high tone ó, preceded
immediately by a low tone subject concord (SC) marker (ò) and a lexically headed
subject constituent with low tone at its right edge (ólí ómòhè, élí ímóhè).(1) ólí ómòhè / élí ímóhè ò ó è ólí émàè.
    the man      the men SC C eat the food
    ‘The man is / The men are eating food.’    Habitual is similarly framed except for tone, which in third peson is conveyed
by low tone ò preceded by a subject concord marker with high tone (ó) and a lexical-
ly headed constituent with right edge high tone (ólí ókpósó ná, élí íkpósó ná).(2) ólí ókpósó ná / élí íkpósó ná      ó ò shèn úkpùn.
    the woman this the women these SC H sell cloth
    ‘This woman sells / These women sell cloth.’     As clausal expressions in the imperfect illustrate, neither number nor gender
impacts shape of the agreement marker. There is no effect on subject concord pho-
nological shape by indexing of grammatical number in the subject constituent (pre-
determiner ólí ~ élí with o- ~ e-) or by gender contrast of lexical head nouns
(ókpósó/íkpósó with o- ~ i- or ómòhè/ímóhè with o- ~ i-). Number and gender distinc-
tions in agreement marking are thus neutralized.
     Remnant agreement is evident within noun phrases, where a select group of ad-
jectives must agree in number with their head noun. Emai attributive phrases
marked by the particle li index grammatical number on adjective forms
(òkhúá/èkhúá, óbín'/ébín') that modify gender bearing nouns. Hence, the grammati-
cal number conveyed by the initial vowel of an attributive adjective (o- for singular
and e- for plural) varies in agreement with grammatical number of the initial vowel
of the head noun (e- for singular and i- or e- for plural).

e- gender characterizes some predeterminers and postdeterminers, modifiers that
precede or follow a head noun, respectively. Included are postdeterminer stems that
serve as kindred modifiers and existential quantifiers in addition to a predeterminer
serving as definite article. Numerals (e.g. òkpá ‘one,’ èélè ‘four’) and universal quan-
tifiers (e.g. èrèmé ‘all,’ òdóòdé ‘each’) show no number prefixation, as with demon-
stratives (e.g. nà ‘this/these,’ áìn ‘that/those,’ nòì ‘next’).ólìná [ónìná] ‘this kind’                     élìná [énìná] ‘these kind’
ólìyó ‘that kind’                             élìyó ‘those kind’

ólì ‘the sg’                                  élì ‘the pl’    Pronoun roots inflect for number. Only the o- ~ e- gender prefix pair is evident.
Forms affected are demonstrative, kindred and existential pronouns as well as the
relative clause pronoun and the interrogative person pronoun.óáìn ‘that one’                               éáìn ‘those ones’
ònà ‘this one’                                ènà ‘these ones’

ódàn ‘different kind of one’                  édàn ‘different kind of ones’
ólìyó ‘that kind of one’                      élìyó ‘those ones of that kind’

óé', óí' ‘who (sg), whom’                     éé', éí' ‘who (pl), whom’    Alternating é- and í- prefixes, which do not feature in Emai’s gender system,
characterize Emai’s associative (genitive) morpheme -si. These prefixes involve an
extremely limited grammatical classification of locus or place, contrastively evident
today only with a few place nouns, e.g. ìwè ‘dwelling,’ as possessum and a posses-
26 | Morphologysor such as òjè in íwé ésì òjè ‘Oje’s temporary dwelling’ and íwé ísì òjè ‘Oje’s perma-
nent dwelling’. The é- stem, i.e. ésì, requires that one construe ìwè as a temporary
dwelling such as one might find near a farmplot, whereas the í- stem construes the
dwelling as more permanent, occurring as a house in a township. For expression of
all other possession relations, regardless of possessum noun, the form that appears
in associative expressions is ísì (Chapter 4, 4.3.3.1)2.1.3 Adverb inflectionIdeophonic adverbs (e.g. khùó) show an alternation between zero (Ø) and an i- pre-
fix that correlates, respectively, with the adverb in clause final position or clause
initial topic position.(3) a. ójé híán'    ùkèlè khùó / *ìkhùó.
       Oje PAP.cut morsel whoosh whoosh
       ‘Oje cut a morsel with a whooshing sound.’
    b. ìkhùó / *khùó,       ójé híán'   ùkèlè.
       whoosh whoosh, Oje PAP.cut morsel
       ‘With a whoosh, Oje cut a morsel.’The Ø ~ i- alternation is limited to ideophonic adverbs that refer to rate of move-
ment, spatial position, posture or sound. In English, these meanings often lexicalize
in verbs. Representative samples of each semantic subclass are shown below.2Rate:
ìbìán, ìbìánbìán / bìán ‘flash resulting from sharp contact’
ìdédédé / dédédé ‘scurried, extremely quick pace’
Spatial Distance:
ìháún, ìháúnháún / háún ‘physical distance exceeding accepted norm’
ìpìén, ìpìénpìén / pìén ‘with small bits positioned here and there’
Movement and Posture:
ìgùàghó / gùàghó ‘jerky fashion’
ìgúáhí / gúáhí ‘crumpled state’
Sound:
ìbèú / bèú ‘banging sound of a hitting activity’
ìbèú / bèú ‘sound of loud bursting into tears’Ideophonic adverbs that refer to manner rather than sound, rate, distance or motion
fail to accept the prefix i- in focus position.

píí ‘flingingly’                         húú ‘pungently’
yóò ‘whooshing’The prefix ì- is disallowed with ideophonic adverbs in topic position that exhibit
reduplication of bisyllabic high tone stems or triplication of monosyllabic high tone
stems. These adverbs tend to express manner.gbírígbírí ‘jerkily’                     dúdúdú ‘very dark’

kpíkpíkpí ‘flutteringly’                 gbágbágbá ‘slappingly’2.1.4 Verb inflectionBare verbs in a monotransitive or intransitive clause attract Factative (F) suffix -i. It
attaches to simple predicates only in perfect aspect: Present and Past. It never oc-
curs with imperfect or prospective aspect, each of which overtly marks the verb
phrase with an aspect marker such as imperfect Continuous (C) ó or prospective
predictive (PRED) ló.(4) a. ólí ómóhé lá'-ì.                 ólí ómòhè lá-ì.
       the man PAP.run-F                the man PRP.run-F
       ‘The man ran.’                   ‘The man has run.’
    b. ólí ómòhè ò ó lá / *ò ó là-ì.

       ‘The man is running.’
    c. ólí ómóhé ló      là vbì ìwè / *ló       là-ì vbì ìwè.
       the man PRED run LOC house PRED run-F LOC house
       ‘The man will run in the house.’Factative -i never co-occurs with any auxiliary (e.g. relative tense ke in *ólí ómóhé ké
lá-ì [the man ANT run-F] ‘The man ran afterward’) or preverb (e.g. aspectualizer gbo
in *ólí ómóhé gbó' lá-ì [the man ADD run-F] ‘The man ran too’). Factative -i only
occurs when auxiliary and preverb positions for a single verb predicate are vacant.
      Factative -i manifests polarity and mood restrictions as well. Although incom-
patible with prohibitive and negative statements, which require preverbal forms, it
is also incompatible with verbs in the imperative, where no overt marker need pre-
cede the verb. Provided a bare predicate, the Factative appears in polar questions.
28 | Morphology(5) ólí úkpùn káká-ì?
    the cloth PRP.become.dry-F
    ‘Has the cloth dried?’     In addition to aspect, auxiliary and preverb limitations, Factative -i imposes a
bare condition on the verb constituent and a displacement condition on arguments
of transitive verbs. To start, Factative is constrained by subcategorization properties
of the verb. With bare intransitive verbs, the Factative occurs.(6) a. ólí úkpùn káká-ì.
       the cloth PRP.become.dry-F
       ‘The cloth has dried.’
    b. ólì óvbèkhàn dá-ì.

       ‘The youth is tall.’
    c. ólí ómòhè lá-ì.
       the man PRP.run-F
       ‘The man has run.’When a bare intransitive verb takes a following adjunct or argument, Factative -i
shows asymmetric distribution. Bare intransitive verbs with locative adjuncts
marked by preposition vbi retain Factative -i regardless of adjunct occurrence in
canonical or noncanonical (focus marked li/ni) constructions.(7) a. ólí ómóhé múzán-í'        vbí úkpódè.

       road alone PF the man           PAP.stand-F
       ‘It was on the road alone that the man stood.’With a following argument marked by preposition vbi, bare intransitive verbs show
Factative -i only when the argument (e.g. èkìn) corresponds to a noncanonical posi-
tion, e.g. focus marked by li/ni or interrogative pronoun in information questions.(8) a. ólí ómóhé ó'            vbì èkìn.

       where the man     PAP.enter-F
       ‘Where did the man enter?’With some limitations, Factative -i attaches to a bare transitive verb whose direct
object is displaced to focus or question position in discourse. When a direct object
occupies focus li/ni or question word position, a transitive verb requires Factative -i.(9) a. ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì / *shén'.

       ‘What did the man sell?’     Limiting this generalization are complex predicates where a transitive verb ei-
ther shows a postverbal particle or a double object complement, occurs in series
with another verb, or incorporates grammaticalized elements. Factative -i is prohib-
ited when a verb stands in construction with a postverbal particle, either Change of
State a, Change of Location o, Applicative li/ni or Temporal Perspective lee.(10) a. ólí ákhè lí ólí ómóhé gbé'       /    *gbé'-ì         á.

        ‘It was eba (prepared cassava) alone that the youth finished eating.’Factative -i is disallowed by verbs in series. When a direct object corresponds to a
focus li/ni constituent or interrogative pronoun, no verb in series (e.g. nwu, re, re,
hian) attracts the Factative.(11) a. ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé nwú' / *nwú-í'             ré.

       what the man PAP.use PAP.use-F            cut wood
       ‘What did the man use to cut wood?’Factative -i fails to occur where an extant transitive verb shows a complex multi-
morphemic diachronic character. For instance, zawo ‘see’ has derived historically
from Deductive auxiliary za ‘must have’ and the verb ghoo (reduced to wo) ‘per-
ceive.’ zawo does not take Factative -i.(12) ólì òkpòsò lí ólí ómóhé záwó' / *záwó'-ì.
     the woman PF the man PAP.see PAP.see-F
     ‘It was the woman that the man saw.’Despite these limiting conditions, adverbial adjuncts, particularly those of time and
place, do not constrain Factative. When a direct object occupies focus position or
corresponds to an interrogative pronoun and a temporal adjunct (òdè) follows a
bare transitive verb, Factative -i remains obligatory.(13) ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé shén-í' / *shén'            òdè.

Affixal morphology in Emai subsumes processes of verbal affixation, nominaliza-

Past perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predictive prospective, each of which exhibits a

Compound lexemes in Emai reflect three compositional patterns. Analytic com-
pounds consist of two noun stems (N-N), sometimes three (N-[N-N]). Synthetic com-
pounds consist of a prefix followed by a verb root and a noun stem (prefix-V-N).
Phrasal compounds utilize grammatical markers in their compositional make up (N-
marker-N).
                                                           Lexical compounds | 552.4.1 Analytic compoundsAnalytic compounds of one structural type consist of two noun stems. Head of the
compound is the left noun stem. Relative to taxonomic structural levels, analytic
compounds tend to express specific or subordinate level designation relative to a
noncompound articulated basic or prototypic concept. The right stem tends to de-
note a more specific referent relative to the more general class referent of the left
noun stem. Constituent relations between noun stems reflect an obligatory inalien-
able relation, contrasting with an alienable relation in corresponding syntactic
phrases with a grammatical marker. For some compound lexemes where meaning is
not derived compositionally, a metaphoric interpretation is required.
     Analytic compounds encode objects that fall into subcategories of flora and
fauna as well as fish, insects, birds, containers, location, time units, food items,
traditional belief, kin relations and social roles. Example compounds and their con-
stituents follow.","[77, 78, 79, 80, 81]"
"4.3.3.3.1      Marked attributive li

is morphologically unmarked, or focus position, where the matrix clause is marked
by li/ni and verb re ‘take’ in series.(151) a. ólí ómóhé gbé'        ófé éghé lí ó ré'      vàdé.

Temporal condition constructions with ìsòkpísòkpá ‘the moment that’ constrain
aspect, modality, order of matrix and subordinate clauses as well as subject corefer-
ence. Subordinate ìsòkpísòkpá clauses require verb re in series.(153) ìsòkpísòkpá lí ó   ré'       míé òhí, ó      ó'     vbì ìwè.

      moment      R she PAP.take see Ohi she PAP.enter LOC house
      ‘At the moment she saw Ohi, she entered the house.’Linear order of clauses in ìsòkpísòkpá constructions is restricted. The ìsòkpísòkpá

position, since they reject a following li/ni focus marker.(157) *ìsòkpísòkpá lí ó ré'         míé óì lí ó ré'          ó   vbì ò.
       moment         R he PAP.take see her PF he PAP.take enter LOC it
       ‘It was at the moment he saw her that he entered it.’Across clauses in ìsòkpísòkpá constructions, subject coreference is required. Disjoint
subject reference is unacceptable.(158) *ìsòkpísòkpá lí ó ré'          míé òhí, ójé ó '        vbì ìwè.
       moment      R she PAP.take see Ohi Oje PAP.enter LOC house
       ‘At the moment shei saw Ohi, Ojej entered the house.’    Intensification of temporal coincidence between subordinate and matrix event
onset points is signaled by Punctual ghe in the ìsòkpísòkpá clause.(159) ìsòkpísòkpá lí ó ré'          ghè míé òhí, ó ó'            vbì ìwè.
      moment         R he PAP.take PCT see Ohi he PAP.enter LOC house
      ‘Just at the very moment hei saw Ohi, hei entered the house.’Addition of ghe to the matrix clause, so that both matrix and subordinate show this
preverb, intensifies further the existing point of coincidence. Presence of ghe in both
clauses emphasizes the absolute lack of temporal distance between their event on-
set points.(160) ìsòkpísòkpá lí ó ré'         ghè míé òhí, ó ghé'            ó vbì ò.

A condition of temporal anticipation or expectation is marked as subordinate by
nominal ètíní as relative clause head followed by a relative clause with verb re ‘take’
in series. When ètíní is contextually understood in a rich narrative discourse, it can
be syntactically omitted.(161) a. ètíní      lí ó ló     rè    dá óì, ì kú              óì kú  à.

         ‘Expecting that he will bathe, he chases them about.’
         ‘Anticipating when he will bathe, he is chasing them about.’     Anticipative ètíní constructions severely constrain aspect, relative tense, order
of constituent clauses and cross clause subject coreference. There is no direct ques-
tion corresponding to Anticipative ètíní constructions.
     Subordinate ètíní clauses severely limit aspect and relative tense. They inflect
for prospective Predictive but not Anticipative, perfect or imperfect aspect.(162) ètíní      lí ó ló    rè dá       ényò, ì kú          óì kú    à.

      expecting R he PRED SUB take drink it I PRP.throw it disperse CS
      ‘Anticipating when he will yet drink it, I have thrown it away.’     Matrix clauses in Anticipative constructions are constrained differently. They

Habitual, or prospective Predictive and Anticipative.(164) a. ètíní      lí ó ló    rè dá        óì, ì kú            óì kú à

volving the verb se ‘move as far as, reach’ or de ‘reach.’ Each requires an accompa-
nying matrix clause with a temporally unbounded verb.","[939, 940, 941, 942, 943]"

the left noun stem’s final vowel fails to occur, contrary to the expected condition in
compounds. And insertion of li between nouns is rejected. The left noun shows high
tone spread. Except for those lexemes with metaphoric significance, the left noun
also serves as compound head relative to the property sense of the right noun. Class
two phrasal compounds have in common the expression of a value judgment.úyàámí òbè ‘bad odor’: úyàámí ‘odor,’ òbè ‘bad, evil’

laa occurs between noun stems and induces high tone spread on the left noun stem,
the head. The right noun stem expresses time or place.óíá láá éìmì ‘person from the spirit world’

terposed between constituent noun stems. The left noun constituent fails to show
high tone spread, as corresponding phrases do.","[91, 92]"

 To clarify, an alternative linear ordering of adverb types leads to ungrammaticality, as illustrated
with the aspectual extent adverb sésésé and the temporal deixis adverb òdè.(i) a. ó wéló'         ólì òtòì    á sésésé òdè.

7 Noncanonical constructions
Noncanonical constructions in Emai express the information status of a clause or
clause constituent in discourse. Discourse-defined constructions include positive
focus (PF) and negative focus (NF), topicalization, antitopic or right dislocation,
information questions, sentence affirmation (SA) and sentence negation (SN). Each
construction is morphosyntactically marked except topicalization, where intonation
downturn follows the topic constituent. Except for sentence affirmation and sen-
tence negation, each construction is characterized by an additional constituent that
precedes or follows its matrix clause. The resulting discourse position, typically a
noun phrase, corresponds to a matrix clause grammatical relation. Each construc-
tion also co-occurs with at least one other construction type, although distinct con-
structions never affect the same matrix clause constituent.(1) a. ólí óvbékhán nà lí ó gbé'                 ólí ákhè á.

       SN the youth          PAP.break the pot CS INT
       ‘It isn't the case that the youth broke the pot (contrary to your opinion).’7.1 Noun phrase focus
Focus constructions assume a contrast between speaker and hearer knowledge
regarding the information status of a nominal referent or predicate event. Construc-
348 | Noncanonical constructionstion purpose is to align hearer and speaker knowledge. Focus position in this con-
struction expresses information that is not shared by speaker and hearer. Its follow-
ing matrix clause conveys shared information.
     Focus position is marked in affirmative structures by the morpheme li/ni and in
negative structures by ki. Focus position immediately precedes a matrix clause and
its constituent corresponds to a grammatical relation in the matrix clause. For ex-
ample, the focus position constituent ólí émà followed by li/ni or ki corresponds to
the direct object relation following the matrix verb shen. Focus position noun
phrases manifest an unmarked tone pattern, i.e. they accept a right edge low tone.
On the other hand, focus construction matrix clauses inflect for a limited range of
aspects, all with a right edge high tone subject.(2) a. ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé ló        shèn ákhò.
       the yam PF the man PRED sell tomorrow
       ‘It was the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’
    b. ólí émà kí ólí ómóhé ló        shèn ákhò.
       the yam NF the man PRED sell tomorrow
       ‘It wasn't the yam that the man will sell tomorrow.’Across affirmative and negative focus types, only positive focus allows omission of
the construction marker. When li/ni is omitted, vowel elision does not affect phono-
logical shape of either focus noun phrase (ólí émà) or matrix clause initial constitu-
ent (ólí ómóhé).(3) ólí émà ólí ómóhé shén'-ì.
    the yam the man PAP.sell-F
    ‘It was the yam that the man sold.’7.1.1 Matrix clause marking of focus relationFocus constructions show variable grammatical marking of the matrix clause posi-
tion corresponding to a focus constituent. They also limit nominal structure types in
focus position. As well, they constrain marking of their matrix clause as to inflec-
tion, auxiliaries and preverbs.
     Focus constructions mark the matrix grammatical relation corresponding to a
focus constitutent with one of three strategies. The first of these affects matrix sub-
ject, possessor or first object in a double object complement. Each shows a pronoun
corresponding to the focus position constituent. A positive or negative focus posi-
tion noun phrase (ólí ómòhè) corresponds to a third person singular pronoun (o ‘he’)
in matrix subject position.
                                                             Noun phrase focus | 349(4) ólí ómòhè lí / kí ó shén'      ólí úkpùn lí     ólì òkpòsò.
    the man PF NF he PAP.sell the cloth APP the woman
    ‘It was / wasn’t the man who sold the cloth to the woman.’Number agreement across focus and corresponding matrix clause position is re-
quired. A plural noun phrase (élí ímòhè) in focus position corresponds to third per-
son plural nominative pronoun, either e or yan depending on matrix clause aspect
(Chapter 5, 5.4).(5) a. élí ímòhè lí / kí é        gbé'       ólí ófè.
       the men PF NF they PAP.kill the rat
       ‘It was / wasn’t the men who killed the rat.’
    b. élí ímòhè lí / kí yán à gbè ófé yè             òjè.
       the men PF NF they H kill rat move.to Oje
       ‘It is / isn't the men who kill rats for Oje.’Focus position noun phrases corresponding to possessor in Associative ísì phrases
(ólì ònwìmè) require a genitive pronoun (òí) in matrix clause possessor position.(6) ólì ònwìmè lí / kí éghó' ísì òí úé'-ì.
    the farmer PF NF money ASS his PAP.be.lost-F
    ‘It was / wasn't the farmer whose money was lost.’A pronoun in matrix possessor position occurs regardless of whether the possessor
(àlèkè) precedes (external possessor, accusative case óí) or follows (internal posses-
sor, genitive case òí) the possessum.(7) a. àlèkè lí / kí ójé dó'                  óí éghó' nwú.
       Aleke PF NF Oje PAP.do.in.stealth her money take
      ‘It was / wasn't from Aleke that Oje stole the money.’
    b. àlèkè lí / kí ójé dó'                éghó' ísì òí nwú.
       Aleke PF NF Oje PAP.do.in.stealth money ASS her take
       ‘It was / wasn't from Aleke that Oje stole the money.’Pronoun marking also affects first object (ólí óvbékhán) in a double object comple-
ment. When first object position corresponds to a focus position constituent, it
shows an accusative pronoun (óí).(8) ólí óvbèkhàn lí / kí ólí ókpósó fí'      óí úkpóràn.
    the youth      PF NF the woman PAP.hit him stick
    ‘It was / wasn't the youth whom the woman hit with a stick.’
350 | Noncanonical constructions    A second marking strategy requires addition of a verb or preverb to the matrix
clause. This affects locative and manner-demonstrative adjuncts, grammatical rela-
tions not subcategorized by a verb. When a focus position noun phrase (èkìn) corre-
sponds to a locative adjunct marked by preposition vbi, the matrix clause shows
verb za ‘be located’ in series. Not retained in focus or matrix clause position is vbi.(9) èkìn     lí / kí ójé zá'         shén ólí úkpùn lí      ólì òkpòsò.
    market PF NF Oje PAP.be.loc sell the cloth APP the woman
    ‘It was / wasn't in the market Oje sold the cloth to the woman.’When a focus position constituent corresponds to a manner-demonstrative adjunct
(e.g. ìyó), the matrix clause shows an obligatory Manner preverb i.(10) ìyó    lí / kí ólí ómóhé í'             gbé ólí ófè.
     DMD PF NF the man PAP.MAN kill the rat
     ‘It was / wasn't that way that the man killed the rat.’     A third marking strategy affects remaining grammatical relations. When a ma-
trix monotransitive verb is morphosyntactically bare, i.e. contains no auxiliary or
preverb morpheme and no marker of imperfect or prospective aspect, direct object
position shows a zero pronoun and the verb displays Factative suffix -i.1 Adjunct
constituents like adverb òdè ‘yesterday’ do not upset this bare condition.(11) a. ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì.
        the cloth PF NF the man PAP.sell-F
        ‘It was / wasn't the cloth that the man sold.’
     b. ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén-í'         òdè.
        the cloth PF NF the man PAP.sell-F yesterday
        ‘It was / wasn’t the cloth that the man sold yesterday.’    An additional constraint on Factative suffixation occurs under conditions of
complex predication. Factative assignment shows four exceptions, with each excep-
tion showing a zero pronoun. The exceptions have in common the addition of mor-
phological material to an otherwise simple predication. When their direct object
corresponds to a focus position constituent, split verbs do not admit Factative -i (mi
dan ‘swallow’ in ólí ómóhé mí ùkèlè dán ‘The man swallowed a morsel’).(12) ùkèlè lí / kí ólí ómóhé mí dán'.
     morsel PF NF the man PAP.swallow
     ‘It was / wasn't a morsel that the man swallowed.’

APP li/ni, Chapter 9) do not accept Factitive -i when their direct object position cor-
responds to a focus constituent. Verbs like shen that take a direct object and an
indirect object (lí ólì òkpòsò) show only a zero pronoun when their direct object
position corresponds to a focus position constituent (ólí úkpùn). And verbs like gbe
that show a direct object followed by the Change of State particle a do not take Fac-
tative -i when their direct object corresponds to a focus position constituent.(13) a. ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'        lí    ólì òkpòsò.
        the cloth PF NF the man PAP.sell APP the woman

        pot PF NF the man PAP.break CS
        ‘It was / wasn't a pot that the man broke.’Neither verb in a serial verb construction accepts Factative -i when its direct object

     the woman PF NF the man PAP.take the cloth move.to
     ‘It was / wasn't the woman who the man took the cloth to.’Finally, verb forms that over historical time have lexicalized morphological material
(e.g. zawo < ze + ao + ghoo> [cause+face+look]) never allow Factative -i when their
direct object corresponds to a focus constituent.(15) ólí úkpùn lí / kí ólí ómóhé zá'wò / *zá'wó'-ì.
     the cloth PF NF the man PAP.see see-F
     ‘It was / wasn't the cloth that the man saw.’     Matrix grammatical relations other than direct object also manifest the zero
pronoun strategy. When a focus constituent corresponds to matrix indirect object, a
zero pronoun occupies the matrix clause position. Under this condition, Applicative
li/ni designating indirect object in the matrix clause is consistently retained in its
postverbal position.(16) ólì òkpòsò lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'    ólí úkpùn ní.
     the woman PF NF the man PAP.sell the cloth APP
     ‘It was / wasn't the woman who the man sold the cloth to.’

     ‘It was / wasn't the yesterday we discussed when the woman bought plantain.’7.1.2 Focus position nominal constraintsThe noun phrase position defined by affirmative and negative focus constructions
reflects few lexical constraints. Nonetheless, it restricts lexical modification and
pronominal type. Focus position marked as affirmative or negative accepts various
nominal types ranging from proper names to count and mass nouns varying in ani-
macy. For instance, focus position accepts proper names (e.g. òlólò).(18) òlólò lí / kí ó gbé'       ólí ófè.
     Ololo PF NF he PAP.kill the rat
     ‘It was / wasn't Ololo who killed the rat.’Positive and Negative Focus positions attract unmodified human (ómòhè), nonhu-
man animate (ófè), inanimate (úkpùn) and place (èkìn) nouns, modified or not by
the definite predeterminer.2(19) a. ómòhè / ólí ómòhè lí ó gbé'            ólí ófè.

       cloth the cloth NF the man PAP.sell APP the woman

    g. èkìn / ólì èkìn      lí ójé zá'          dé ólí úkpùn.
       market the market PF Oje PAP.be.loc buy the cloth
       ‘It was in a market / the market that Oje bought the cloth.’
    h. èkìn / ólì èkìn       kí ójé zá'          dé ólí úkpùn.
       market the market NF Oje PAP.be.loc buy the cloth
       ‘It wasn't in a market / the market that Oje bought the cloth.’     Focus position restricts postdeterminers in each of the classes demonstrative,
kindred, numeral and quantifier. Deictic and contrastive demonstratives modify
focus position nouns. Deictic demonstratives appear in either positive or negative
focus position: proximal nà (ólí ómóhé nà lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man this PF NF he
PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn't this man who killed the rat’) and distal áìn (ólí
ómóhé áìn lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man that PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn't
that man who killed the rat’). Contrastive demonstrative nóì, which never occurs
with the definite predeterminer, is found in affirmative but not negative focus con-
stituents (ómóhé nóì lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man next PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was
the next man who killed the rat’).
     Kindred modifiers, which never combine with the definite article, show limita-
tions across focus polarity types. Deictic kindred élìyó appears in both affirmative
and negative focus positions (ófé élìyó lí / kí ó ó' vbì òò [rat that.kind PF NF it
PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was / wasn't that kind of rat that entered the hole’). Contras-
tive kindred ódàn is restricted to positive focus position (ófé ódàn lí / *kí ó ó' vbì òò
[rat different.kind PF NF it PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was a different kind of rat that
entered the hole’).
     Quantifier types are constrained in their distribution across affirmative and
negative focus constructions. The collective universal quantifier èrèmé, with op-
tional definite predeterminer, appears in focus position, irrespective of focus polari-
ty ((élí) ímóhé èrèmé lí / kí é ó' vbì ìwè [the men all PF NF they PAP.enter LOC house]
‘It was / wasn't all the men that entered the house’). However, the distributive uni-
versal quantifier òdóòdé is never acceptable, regardless of focus polarity (*ímóhé
òdóòdé lí / kí é ó' vbì ìwè [men each PF NF they PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / was-
n't each of the men that entered the house’).
     Existential quantifiers, which never co-occur with the definite article, are not
distributed symmetrically across focus polarity types. Limited to positive focus con-
structions are partitive existential quantifier ósò (ómóhé ósò lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè
[man certain PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was a certain man who killed the rat’) and
contrastive existential quantifier óvbèé (ómóhé óvbèé lí / *kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man an-
354 | Noncanonical constructionsother PF NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was another man who killed the rat’). They fail
with negative focus ki.
     Cardinal numerals greater than ‘one’ appear in focus position, regardless of
their co-occurrence with the definite article, e.g. èvá ‘two’ ((élí) éfè èvá lí / kí é ó' vbì
òò [the rats two PF NF they PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was / wasn't (the) two rats who
entered the hole’). Collective numerals, which do not co-occur with the definite
article, modify nouns in positive or negative focus position, e.g. èvèvá ‘both, all two
of’ (éfè èvèvá lí / kí é ó' vbì òò [rats all.two PF NF they PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘It was /
wasn't both rats that entered the hole’). With an otherwise unmodified noun, nu-
meral òkpá ‘one’ occurs in positive or negative focus position (ómòhè òkpá lí / kí ó ó'
vbì ìwè [man one PF NF he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn't one man who en-
tered the house’). In addition, emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone’ modifies nouns
marked as definite in positive or negative focus position (ólí ómòhè òkpá lí / kí ó ó'
vbì ìwè [the man alone PF NF he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn't the man
alone who entered the house’).
     Focus position noun phrases also accept nonlexical postdeterminers. Focus
noun phrases take as postnominal modifiers Associative ísì phrases (éwé ísì ólì
òkpòsò lí / kí ó ó' vbì ìwè [goat ASS the woman PF NF it PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was
/ wasn’t the goat of the woman that entered the house’), Relator li phrases (éwé lí
óbín' lí / kí ó ó' vbì ìwè [goat R dark PF NF it PAP.enter LOC house] ‘It was / wasn’t
the dark goat that entered the house’) and relative clause li/ni constituents (ómóhé lí
ó dá' ólí ényò lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [man R he PAP.drink the wine PF NF he PAP.kill the
rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the man who drank the wine who killed the rat’). Speaker pref-
erence is for focus constituents without definite article ólì/élì.
     Pronominal forms also occupy focus position. Irrespective of construction polar-
ity, focus position accepts personal and impersonal pronouns. However, constraints
apply that affect case as well as person and number agreement. Among personal
pronouns, only emphatic forms (e.g. ìyàìn, mèmè) appear in focus position. Emphat-
ic personal pronouns must agree in person and number with their matrix clause
anaphoric pronoun (yan or i). Across focus polarity types, emphatic pronouns in
focus position accept emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone.’(20) a. ìyàìn / mèmè lí / kí yán / í gbé'          ólí ófè.
        they I        PF NF they I PAP.kill the rat
        ‘It was / wasn’t they / I who killed the rat.’
     b. ìyàìn òkpá lí / kí yán gbé'           ólí ófè.
        they alone PF NF they PAP.kill the rat
        ‘It was / wasn't they alone who killed the rat.’   Focus position attracts impersonal pronouns from demonstrative, kindred, nu-
meral and quantifier classes with few restrictions. Each demonstrative pronoun
                                                               Noun phrase focus | 355occurs in focus position: distal deictic óáìn (óáìn lí / kí ó gbé' ófè [that.one PF NF it
PAP.kill rat] ‘It was /wasn’t that one who killed a rat’), proximal ònà (ònà lí / kí ó
gbé' ófè [this.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It was / wasn’t this one who killed a rat’),
emphatic proximal ónánà (ónánà lí / kí ó gbé' ófè [this.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It
was / wasn’t this very one who killed a rat’), as well as contrastive demonstrative
ónóì (ónóì lí / (*kí ) ó gbé' ófè [next.one PF NF it PAP.kill rat] ‘It was the next one who
killed a rat’).
     Both kindred pronouns occur in focus position: deictic élìyó (élìyó lí / kí ólí
ómóhé gbé'-ì [that.kind PF NF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't that kind of one
that the man killed’) and contrastive ódàn (ódàn lí / kí ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [differ-
ent.kind PF NF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't a different kind of one that the
man killed’).3
     Focus position accepts few quantifier pronouns.4 It takes the collective univer-
sal quantifier èrèmé (èrèmé lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [all PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F]
‘It was / wasn't all that the woman killed’). Ungrammatical in focus position are the
distributive universal quantifier òdóòdé as well as both existential pronouns (ósò
and óvbèé).
     Focus position accepts numeral pronouns greater than ‘one’ in their cardinal
form, e.g. èvá (èvá lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [two PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was
/ wasn’t two that the woman killed’) or collective form, e.g. èvèvá (èvèvá lí / kí ólí
ókpósó gbóó'-ì [all.two PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn’t both that the
woman killed’). As head of a partitive vbi phrase, cardinal numerals also occur in
focus position, e.g. èvá (èvá vbì ò lí / kí ólí ókpósó gbóó'-ì [two LOC it PF NF the
woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't two of them that the woman killed’).5
     Numeral pronoun ‘one’ appears in focus position, as cardinal òkpá (òkpá lí / kí
ólí ókpósó gbé'-ì [one PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was / wasn't one that the
woman killed’) or partitive úkpòkpá (úkpòkpá vbì ò lí /*kí ólí ókpósó gbé'-ì [one LOC
it PF NF the woman PAP.kill-F] ‘It was one of them that the woman killed’). Howev-
er, úkpòkpá only occurs in positive focus.
     Focus position also accepts expressions framed as pronominally headed relative
clauses (ólí ó (*á) dé' ólí úkpùn lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [one he RC PAP.buy the cloth PF
NF it PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the one who bought the cloth who killed the
rat’) or attribution phrases (ólí óbín' lí / kí ó gbé' ólí ófè [the dark.one PF NF it
PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was / wasn’t the dark one who killed the rat’). Pronominally
headed relatives only occur in focus position under conditions of specific reference.
Generic reference (e.g. ‘whoever’) induced by Recurrent preverb a in the relative
clause renders them unacceptable.
356 | Noncanonical constructions7.1.3 Matrix clause propertiesFocus constructions constrain expression of mood and polarity as well as inflection,
auxiliaries and preverbs. Regarding mood, focus constructions never appear as
imperatives or prohibitives. Relative to polarity, both affirmative and negative focus
constructions appear as polar questions (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì? [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.sell-F] ‘Was / Wasn’t it the yam that the man sold?’).
     In their matrix clauses, affirmative focus constructions allow perfect negation
marked by ì. Negative focus constructions disallow it (ólí émá nà òkpá lí / *kí ólí
ómóhé í ì shèn [the yam this alone PF NF the man SC NEG sell] ‘It was this yam alone
which the man did not sell’).
     Matrix clauses in focus constructions limit inflection and auxiliaries. Relative to
aspect, they inflect for Past perfect, imperfect Habitual or prospective Predictive.6
All show a subject phrase with a high tone right edge. Matrix clauses in focus con-
structions reject Present perfect, imperfect Continuous or prospective Anticipative.(21) a. ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé shén'-ì.
        the yam PF NF the man PAP.sell-F
        ‘It was / wasn't the yam that the man sold.’
     b. émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ó ò shèn.
        yam PF NF the man SC H sell
        ‘It is / isn't yam that the man sells.’
     c. ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ló           shèn.
        the yam PF NF the man PRED sell
        ‘It is / isn't this yam that the man will sell.’     Focus construction matrix clauses limit deontic and epistemic modality as well
as relative tense. Of the modality forms, deontic Hortative í is never grammatical in
focus constructions. Epistemic forms are not as restricted, even if distributionally
sensitive to focus polarity. Appearing only in negative focus is Certaintive ma (ólí
émà kí / *lí ólí ómóhé má' shèn [the yam NF PF the man PAP.CER sell] ‘It wasn't the
yam that the man surely sold’), while Dubitatives only occur in positive focus polar
interrogative constructions, e.g. bia (ólí émà lí / *kí ólí ómóhé bíá' shèn? [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.DUB sell] ‘Was it the yam that the man actually sold?’) and vba (ólí
émà lí / *kí ólí ómóhé vbá' shèn? [the yam PF NF the man PAP.DUB sell] ‘Was it the
yam that the man really could have sold?’).
     Some epistemic forms occur in affirmative and negative focus constructions:
Concessive rere (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ré'rè shén? [the yam PF NF the man
PAP.CONC sell] ‘Was / Wasn't it the yam that the man even sold?’) and Hypothetical
kha (ólí émá nà lí / kí ólí ómóhé khà shén [the yam this PF NF the man PAP.HYP sell]
‘It was / wasn't this yam that the man would have sold’). Concessive, though, re-
                                                             Noun phrase focus | 357quires a polar interrogative structure. Remaining epistemic forms reflecting rational
judgments, Deductive za and Resultative za, fail in focus constructions.
      Relative tense exponents appear in focus matrix clauses: Anterior ke (ólí émà lí /
kí ólí ómóhé ké' shèn [the yam PF NF the man PAP.ANT sell] ‘It was / wasn’t the yam
that the man sold afterward’) and Subsequent kpe (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé kpé' shèn
[the yam PF NF the man PAP.SUB sell] ‘It was /wasn’t the yam that the man sold
despite pending conditions’).
      Focus construction matrix clauses severely limit preverb occurrence. For pre-
verbs that occur, there is a tendency to require a nondeclarative, polar interrogative
structure in negative focus constructions.
      As a class, aspectualizers interact with focus construction mood and polarity.
Matrix clauses linked to a positive focus position allow aspectualizers Repetitive che
(ólí émà lí ólí ómóhé ché' shèn [the yam PF the man PAP.REP sell] ‘It was the yam
that the man sold again’), Additive gbo (émà lí ólí ómóhé gbó' è [yam PF the man
PAP.ADD eat] ‘It was yam that the man ate too’) and Durative se (émà òkpá lí ólí
ómóhé sé' shèn [yam alone PF the man PAP.DUR sell] ‘It was one yam that the man
still sold’). They reject Punctual ghe, regardless of polarity or mood.
      Negative focus matrix clauses accept all phasal aspectualizers but Punctual ghe.
They do so provided the construction assumes a polar interrogative form: che (ólí
émà kí ólí ómóhé ché' shèn? [the yam NF the man PAP.REP sell] ‘Wasn't it the yam
that the man sold again?’), gbo (émà kí ólí ómóhé gbó' è? [yam NF the man PAP.ADD
eat] ‘Wasn't it yam that the man also ate?’) and se (émà òkpá kí ólí ómóhé sé' shèn?
[yam alone NF the man PAP.DUR sell] ‘Wasn't it one yam that the man still sold?’).
      Boundary aspectualizers manifest three distribution patterns. Irrespective of
construction polarity or mood, one finds Conative òó (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé ó ó'
shèn [the yam PF NF the man SC CON sell] ‘It was / wasn’t the yam that the man
went to sell’).
      Neither Ingressive ya nor Egressive mo occurs in focus matrix clauses. However,
their Past Absolute functions are available in positive focus: ya (ìmátó nà lí ólí
ómóhé yà dé élá úkpè [car this PF the man PAP.PA buy TP year] ‘It was this car that
the man used to buy in the year we discussed’) and mo (émá mè lí ólí ómóhé mó'
shèn [yam my PF the man PAP.PA sell] ‘It was my yam that the man at one time
sold’). With negative focus, Past Absolutes require a polar interrogative frame: ya
(ìmátó nà kí ólí ómóhé yà dé élá úkpè? [car this NF the man PAP.PA buy TP year]
‘Wasn't it this car that the man used to buy in the year we discussed?’) and mo (émá
mè kí ólí ómóhé mó' shèn? [yam my NF the man PAP.PA sell] ‘Wasn't it my yam that
the man at one time sold?’).
      Of the temporal preverbs (kpao ‘initially,’ bobo ‘promptly,’ tua ‘hurriedly’), only
kpao appears in focus matrix clauses (ólí émà lí / kí ólí ómóhé kpá'ò shén [the yam PF
NF the man PAP.earlier sell] ‘It was / wasn't the yam that the man earlier on sold’).
358 | Noncanonical constructions     From the quantity class, only nonintensifier preverbs are acceptable in focus
matrix clauses. Focus constructions reject Absolute Intensifier zemi and Nonabso-
lute Intensifier zeze. Collective gba and Emphatic Reflexive dobo nonetheless occur.
Both affirmative and negative focus accept Emphatic Reflexive dobo regardless of
mood (ólí ómòhè lí / kí ó dóbó' óì é ólí émà [the man PF NF he PAP.REFL him eat the
yam] ‘It was / wasn't the man who by himself ate the yam’).7 With Collective gba,
matrix clause is declarative under positive focus (ólí émà lí élí ímóhé gbá' è [the yam
PF the men PAP.COL eat] ‘It was the yam that the men ate together’) but interroga-
tive under negative focus (ólí émà kí élí ímóhé gbá' è? [the yam NF the men PAP.COL
eat] ‘Wasn't it the yam that the men ate together?’).
     Matrix clause focus constructions never allow any of the remaining preverbs:
evaluative duu ‘for no reason,’ woo ‘instead,’ and kuku ‘after all;’ subject attributive
dábo ‘deliberately,’ dóbo ‘mistakenly,’ dúda ‘defiantly,’ miti ‘able,’ gbúdu ‘coura-
geously,’ dégbè ‘carefully,’ totóbo intensely’ and kakégbe ‘perseveringly;’ or man-
ner-demonstrative DMD ìyó and PMD ìná.
     Additionally, focus constructions are limited by S-complement type and clause
subordination. Positive focus constructions occur under indicative and conditional
complements, marked by khi and si respectively. But they never appear under sub-
junctives signaled by li (*òjè ò ó hòò lí ólì òkpòsò lí ó shén' ólí émà [Oje SC C want
SUBJ the woman PF she PAP.sell the yam] ‘Oje wants the woman to sell the yam’).(22) a. òjè één-í         khí ólí ómòhè lí ó é'          ólí émà.

        ‘Oje is asking whether it was the woman who sold the yam.’Negative focus constructions are limited to indicative khi complements. They are not

[Oje SC C ask COND the woman NF she PAP.sell the yam] ‘Oje is asking whether it

  Never serving as li complement is the abstract noun àtà ‘truth’: *émí lì àtà [thing R true] ‘true

   Age attributives fail with common noun heads that are human. Instead, analytic compounds
consisting of a human noun followed by an age noun refer to adult (not nonadult) standing in socie-
ty rather than age relative to the immediate moment.*ómóhé lí ódíòn                                   ómóhódíòn

  With either count or mass noun head, Relator li is optional. Nonetheless under this free variation
condition, meaning of the phrase and tone on the head noun (spread of high tone) are identical:
ímóhé (lì) ògbèré [men R plentiful] ‘a lot of men,’ ékén (lì) ògbèré [sand R plentiful] ‘a lot of sand.’25
  Collective and distributive numeral complements follow third person plural pronouns: íyáín lì èvá
[they R two] ‘both of them / group of two,’ and ìyàìn èvá [they two] ‘two of them.’26
  As a final comment, instances where phrases with collective and attribution interpretations might
be expected to co-occur, each marked by Relator li with a place or human noun in head position, fail
to do so: *íwé lì èvá lì kéré [house R two R small.size] ‘group of two small-sized houses’; *íwé lì kéré lì
èvá [house R small.size R two] ‘group of two small-sized houses’;*ímóhé lì èélè lì kéré [men R four R
small.size] ‘group of four small-sized men’; *ímóhé lì kéré lì èélè [men R small.size R four] ‘group of
four small-sized men.’27
     Pronominally headed relative clauses show a plural shape with élí in head position.(i) élí é      nwú'      émà lí    ònwìmè, é       fí'       áwá údò.
    ones they PAP.take yam APP farmer they PRP.hit dog stone
    ‘As for the ones who gave yam to the farmer, they hit a dog with a stone.’28
  Pronominally headed relative clauses also occur in Emai. They fail to show Relator li, and they are
headed by a relative pronoun denoting either an animate (ólí), inanimate (émé') or place (ébé')
236 | Noun modifiersreferent (Chapter 5, 5.8). Relative pronouns uniformly show high tone or high tone followed by high
downstep.(i) a. ólí ólí ómóhé záwó'

       ‘the one who the man saw’
    b. émé' ólí ókpósó dé'-ì

       ‘what the woman bought’
    c. ébé' ólí ókpósó ó'-ì
       where the woman PAP.enter-F
       ‘where the woman entered’29
  Deictic time nominals (òdè, ákhò and éènà) serving as temporal adjuncts (òdè in ólí ómóhé fí ólí
áwá údó òdè ‘The man hit the dog with a stone yesterday’) never relativize.(i) *ódé        lí ólí ómóhé fí'     ólí áwá údó gbó'           tèè.
     yesterday R the man PAP.hit the dog stone PAP.ADD be.long
     ‘Yesterday when the man hit the dog with a stone was also long.’30
  As a further note, ambiguity as to phrase head can occur in constructions with genitive phrase
and relative clause. In (i) relative clause head preceding Relator li could be possessum úríáí or pos-
sessor óvbéé; either could serve as direct object of shen ‘sell’ and thus as head of the relative clause.(i) úríáí ísì óvbéé lí ójé shén-ì
    tail ASS monkey R Oje sell-F
    ‘tail of the monkey that Oje sold’
5 Pronouns and conjunction
Emai pronouns express relations relative to linguistic or situational context. They
reflect five basic types: personal, bound (anaphoric), interrogative, locative and
impersonal. Exponents of these types can reflect case, person, number, gender,
and/or definiteness. In characterizing Emai grammatical structure, both overt pro-
noun and zero (gapped) pronoun prove useful.
     Zero pronoun is illustrated by the syntactic position following the transitive
verb nwu ‘take.’ This verb is subcategorized for a direct object. nwu takes a pronoun
(e.g. óì ‘it’) in the absence of a lexical noun. In series with another verb (e.g. hian
‘cut’), as well as in other structural patterns, nwu also takes a zero pronoun.(1) a. ólí ókpósó ló     nwú óì ní émè.
       the woman PRED take it APP me
       ‘The woman will give it to me.’
    b. ólí ókpósó ló     hìàn éànmì nwú ní émè.
       the woman PRED cut meat take APP me
       ‘The woman will cut meat in order to give it to me.’5.1 Definite personal pronouns
Definite personal pronouns reflect person (first, second or third), number (singular
and plural), case (nominative, accusative, dative and genitive) and discourse status
(emphatic).

pronouns varies according to aspect, mood, or polarity features of the clause (Chap-
ter 3, 3.1.1). Tone can also vary on other pronouns as grammatical features interact
throughout a clause.(2) ìyàìn lí yán nwú'        óì ní émé vbí íwé     ísì èé.
    they PF they PAP.take it APP me LOC house ASS your
    ‘It was they who gave it to me in your house.’Restrained by case, number and person, personal pronouns refer to participants in
the situational or linguistic context. Third person subject forms (ó ‘she’) can co-refer
to a noun phrase in a preceding sentence.(3) ólì òkpòsò míé     òhí. ó ó             vbì ìwè.
    the woman PRP.see Ohi she PAP.enter LOC house
    ‘The woman1 saw Ohi. She1 entered the house.’In complex sentences containing two or more clauses, nominative pronouns (ó)
express co-reference to a lexical antecedent (áléké) in a preceding clause. They tend
not to co-refer to a noun phrase in a following clause. This condition obtains regard-
less of whether the pronoun occurs in the main or subordinate clause of a complex
sentence.(4) a. bí áléké ré'         míé òhí, ó ó'            vbì ìwè.

        she PAP.enter LOC house as Aleke PAP.CONC see Ohi
        ‘Shei entered the house, when Alekei saw Ohi.’     For third person plural subject, e and yan exponents occur in complementary
distribution. Plural e tends not to co-refer to a noun phrase across a sentence
boundary; instead, it co-refers within a clause. In contrast, plural yan co-refers to a
noun phrase within or across sentences.(5) a. élí ívbèkhàn yé             ògò. yán gbé'        ófè.
       the youths    PRP.move.to bush they PAP.kill rat

        the youths    PRP.move.to bush they PAP.kill rat
       ‘The youths went to the bush. They killed rats.’In addition, distribution of third person plural subject forms yan and e is controlled
by matrix clause aspect and structural position. Plural e is restricted to perfect as-
pect. It never occurs in clauses inflected for imperfect, as yan does. Plural third per-
son e is limited to subject position relative to an antecedent in the same clause or
sentence; yan is not. When a plural noun appears in discourse relevant topic, focus,
antitopic (right dislocated), question or relative clause position and the matrix
clause inflects for perfect aspect, e or yan appears as subject.(6) a. élí ívbèkhàn, é / yán gbé'             ólí ófè.
       the youths      they they PAP.kill the rat
       ‘As for the youths, they killed the rat.’

       ones they they PAP.be LOC river PRP.be.lost-F

240 | Pronouns and conjunctionWhen a plural noun appears in discourse relevant topic, focus, antitopic (right dis-
located), question or relative clause position and the matrix clause is inflected for
imperfect aspect, yan occupies subject position. e never does, as topic and focus
li/ni constructions suggest.(7) a. ívbèkhàn, yán à / *é è gbè ófè.
       youths       they H      they H kill rat
       ‘As for youths, they kill rats.’
    b. ívbèkhàn lí yán à / *é è gbè ófè.
       youths      PF they H       they H kill rat
       ‘It is youths who kill rats.’When the third person plural emphatic pronoun appears in focus or topic position
linked to a matrix clause inflected for perfect aspect, subject position accepts only
yan, not e.(8) a. ìyàìn lí yán / *é       gbé'      ólí ófè.
       they PF they they PAP.kill the rat
       ‘It was they who killed the rat.’

       they they they PAP.kill the rat
       ‘As for them, they killed the rat.’Within S-complements (marked by Indicative khi for example, Chapter 13, 13.2.1),
subject position under perfect aspect accepts yan or e, with yan showing ambiguity
between personal (disjoint reference vis-à-vis subject élí ímóhé) and logophoric
(conjoint reference vis-à-vis élí ímóhé) interpretations. In contrast, e offers only a
disjoint interpretation.(9) élí ímóhé ré'         é khì yàn / è           gbé      ólí ófè.
    the men PAP.CONC say IND they            they PRP.kill the rat
    ‘The men said that they killed the rat.’     Of the personal pronouns, only emphatic forms appear with postdeterminer
modifiers. Emphatic pronouns for each person occur with emphatic partitive òkpá
‘alone.’ No emphatic pronoun, however, co-occurs with the definite predeterminer
(*élì ìyàìn ‘the they’).mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn            / màmàì / vbàvbà / ìyàìn òkpá
I          you      he / she/ it we         you   they alone

person plural allow postdeterminers from quantity, demonstrative and attributive
classes. The third person plural emphatic pronoun accepts the greatest range of
modifiers. It is found with cardinal or collective numeral modifiers but not distribu-
tive or ordinal numeral modifiers.ìyàìn èvá ‘two of them’                 íyáín lì èvá ‘both of them, both’

lective èrèmé, distributive òdóòdé) but not existential quantifiers (partitive ésò,
contrastive évbèé).íyáín èrèmé ‘all of them’                íyáín òdóòdé ‘each of them’

élìyó (*íyáín élìyó [they that.kind] ‘they of that kind’) nor contrastive édàn (*íyáín
édàn [they different.kind] ‘they of a different kind’).
     Relative to postnominal modifier types designated by a grammatical morpheme,
the third person plural emphatic pronoun accepts Relator li attributive phrases but
not relative clauses (*íyáín lí ójé shén' lí ókpósó [they R Oje PAP.sell APP woman]
‘they that Oje sold to the woman’) or Associative ísì phrases (*íyáín ísì òjè [they ASS
Oje]‘those of Oje’).íyáín lí óbín' ‘they that dark’
they R dark
242 | Pronouns and conjunctionThe third person singular emphatic pronoun is more restricted than its plural coun-
terpart. As shown earlier, the singular form combines only with emphatic partitive
òkpá ‘alone.’ The singular emphatic fails to combine with numeral òkpá ‘one.’ìyòìn òkpá ‘he alone’                    *ìyòìn òkpá ‘one he’
he alone                                  he    oneAlso quite limited are first and second person plural emphatic pronouns. They only

we    all                                we     each5.2 Expletive and indefinite pronouns
Emai subject position shows both an expletive and an indefinite pronoun. Expletive
o occurs in relation to an extraposed complement clause. Although an embedded S-
complement can serve as logical subject, it is obligatorily extraposed to clause final
position. Its grammatical subject position is held by expletive pronoun o.(10) a. ò hùnmé                 khì òjè gbé        ólí ényè.
        it PRP.be.fortuitous IND Oje PRP.kill the snake
        ‘It is fortuitous that Oje killed the snake.’
     b. *khì òjè gbé         ólí ényè húnmé.
         IND Oje PRP.kill the snake PRP.be.fortuitous
         ‘That Oje killed the snake is fortuitous.’   Subject position also shows indefinite pronoun a ‘one.’ If not translated by the
English passive, it is rendered with indefinite plural ‘they’ or ‘one’ in active voice.(11) á    gbé'      ólí ófè.
     one PAP.kill the rat
     ‘One / They killed the rat / The rat was killed.’Indefinite a never occupies nonsubject grammatical positions such as direct or indi-
rect object, or discourse-defined positions like focus or topic.1

         one PF he PAP.kill the rat
         ‘It was one that killed the rat.’Indefinite a is limited to subject positions subcategorized for human noun agentives
or experiencers, as grammatical gbe above illustrates. It is not licensed by stative
verbs (ri, da) or motion verbs (o, ye), which otherwise allow a human noun subject.(13) a. *à ríì          vbì ìwè.

     d. *à yé                 ìwè.
         one PRP.move.to house
         ‘One moved toward the house.’Indefinite subject a occurs with transitive verbs requiring experiencer subjects.
However, it does so only in negative constructions.(14) a. á    ì     èén khí ólì òkpòsò sá            ólí ómòhè.
         one NEG know IND the woman PRP.shoot the man

         ‘One knew that the woman shot the man.’Indefinite a never co-refers across sentences, across clause boundaries within a
complex sentence or across clauses embedded within one another.

         ‘The youthsi knew that theyi killed the rat.’    Two nominal forms that in some constructions exhibit a placeholder function in
lieu of pronouns are émì ‘thing’ and óìà ‘person, human being.’ émì refers to non-
human entities. It occurs as second object in a double object complement when a
specific referent is required but not named (e.g. émì ‘something’ ~ úkpóràn ‘stick’),
as also happens in subject and direct object positions. Nonetheless, émì never oc-
curs as indirect object following Applicative li/ni or as first object in a double object
construction, both of which require human nouns.(16) a. ólì òkpòsò fí        ólí óvbékhán émì / úkpóràn.

ly with the universal quantifier òdóòdé, which only combines with human nouns.ólí émì ‘the thing’                      émí nóì         ‘the next thing’

Genitive or possessor pronouns follow Associative ísì but they also appear in associ-
ative phrases without ísì. Omission of ísì is controlled by possessor number and
person. First and third person pronouns act uniformly while second person reveals a
split distribution, singular èé ‘you’ behaving like third person, and plural àvbá ‘you’
like first person. Under ísì omission, the possessor pronoun assumes direct object
rather than genitive form.
     Alienable possession phrases with pronoun possessors display two patterns
concerning ísì omission. With first person and second person plural and first person
singular, ísì is optional.ópíá    ísì èmé / àmáí / àvbá           ópíá mè / màì / vbà
cutlass ASS my our        your          cutlass my our your
‘my / our / your cutlass’               ‘my / our / your cutlass’With third person singular and plural as well as second person singular in alienable
relations, ísì is obligatory.ópíá     ísì òí / èé / ìyáín            *ópíá     óì / é / íyàìn
cutlass ASS his your their               cutlass his your their

tern. When the possessor exponent is first person singular or plural, or second per-
son plural, ísì is optional.áwé ísì èmé / àmáí / àvbá              áwé mè / màì / vbá

‘my leg’                               ‘my leg’    For inalienable relations, when possessor is third person singular, second per-
son singular or third person plural, ísì is obligatory.óé ísì òí / èé                         *óé óì / é
leg ASS his your                        leg his your

legs ASS their                          legs their
‘their legs’                            ‘their legs’    The syntactic realization of inalienable possession within a sentence, and hence
the syntactic realization of genitive pronouns, is controlled by referential identity
between possessor and grammatical subject, verb type (physical event vs cognitive
event) and alienability relation.
    Within its clause, grammatical subject constrains appearance of pronoun pos-
sessor, although only for inalienable relations. Where referential identity exists
between inalienable possessor and grammatical subject, i.e. conjoint reference, the
possessor constituent (òí) and its ísì governor are disallowed.(18) ólí ómòhè gbáló     óbò / *óbó ísì òí.
     the man PRP.wrap hand hand ASS his
     ‘The mani wrapped hisi hand / wrapped his own hand.’Where non-identity, i.e. disjoint reference, obtains between subject and possessor,
an ísì phrase with a genitive pronoun complement is obligatory.(19) ólí ómòhè gbáló        óbó ísì òí.
     the man     PRP.wrap hand ASS his
     ‘The mani wrapped hisj hand.’
248 | Pronouns and conjunctionPhrases where possessor precedes possessa (external possession, Chapter 4,
4.3.3.1.1) never allow an identity relation between possessor and grammatical sub-
ject. Non-identity is required.(20) ólí ómòhè gbáló      óí óbò.
     the man PRP.wrap his hand
     ‘The mani wrapped hisj hand.’     Conditions governing possessor expression with inalienable possessa apply to
direct object and locative goal positions. Conjoint reference leads to absence of both
ísì and possessor pronoun, while disjoint reference conditions presence of ísì and its
possessor pronoun (òí).(21) a. ólí ómòhè híán        àwè.
        the man PRP.cut legs
        ‘The mani cut hisi legs.’
     b. ólí ómòhè híán        àwè ísì òì.
        the man PRP.cut leg ASS his
        ‘The mani cut hisj / *hisi legs.’

        ‘The womani put shoes on heri feet.’
     d. ólì òkpòsò kú           ìbàtà ó vbí áwé ísì òí.
        the woman PRP.cast shoes CL LOC feet ASS her
        ‘The womani put shoes on herj feet.’    Alienable possessa are not similarly constrained. Whether conjoint or disjoint
reference obtains between grammatical subject and possessor, possessor and ísì are
obligatory. Absence of ísì and its complement encode a nonpossession relation.(22) a. ólì òkpòsò gbé         ákhé ísì òì á.
        the woman PRP.break pot ASS her CS
        ‘The womani broke herj / heri own pot.’
     b. ólì òkpòsò gbé         ákhè á.
        the woman PRP.break pot CS
        ‘The womani broke a / *heri pot.’Inalienable possession noun phrases, regardless of conjoint or disjoint reference
between possessor and grammatical subject, are disallowed in indirect object posi-
tion marked by li/ni.

      ‘The mani prepared herbs for hisi/j feet.’5.4 Bound pronouns
Emai shows three bound pronouns co-referring to a preceding noun phrase. Reflex-
ive and Reciprocal must have their antecedent in the same clause. Logophoric pro-
noun antecedents cannot be in the same clause.
    Logophoric (LOG) pronouns are employed in narrative discourse to track gram-
matical subject of a communication or cognition verb (Chapter 13, 13.3.3). Limited to
third person, logophoric pronouns reflect case (subject/non-subject grammatical
relations) and number (singular/plural). Their form does not distinguish between
nonsubject position and positions defined by discourse status (i.e. focus or topic).","[260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275]"
"14.8.1 Contrastive clause àmáàContrastive clausal conjunction is expressed by àmáà ‘but.’ Positioned between
clauses, àmáà requires an affirmative~negative contrast between clauses. The af-
firmative clause precedes the negative one; reversing this order is unacceptable.(286) a. ò é          émàè khóón àmáà ó ì            mìè ámé nwù ón.

             whereas he PRP.know IND lie         be
          ‘The Obai intended to kill Ohi, whereas hei knew it was a lie.’Clauses in bee constructions are strictly ordered. The ‘say’ clause and its khi com-
plement cannot follow the subordinate bee clause. While bee clauses fail independ-
ent of another clause, they never initiate a discourse.(291) a. *béé      óbá' één'         khì èhèìn óò,

trast, even more stringent than àmáà. In addition to an affirmative~negative con-
trast across clauses, disjunctive dà requires identity of verb and interrogative mood.
Disjunctives in declarative form or with contrasting verbs (e.g. de ‘buy’ and so ‘sew’)
are unacceptable.

          ‘Did he not buy the cloth or did he buy the cloth?’Clauses in dà disjunctives co-relate with respect to inflection. Expression of negative
polarity is not limited to Perfect Negation. When Perfect Negation is in the negative
clause, Present perfect is in the affirmative. When prospective Predictive ló occurs in
the affirmative clause, Prospective Negation kha appears in the negative.(294) a. ò dé          ólí úkpùn dà ó ì           dè ólí úkpùn?

tive disjunct, just as they do Anticipative in the affirmative disjunct and Prospective
Negation in the negative.(296) a. *ójé dé'         ólí úkpùn dà òjè í ì          dè ólí úkpùn?

          ‘Is Oje about to buy the cloth or will Oje not buy the cloth?’    Across clauses, disjunctive dà constructions require subject coreference. Dis-
joint subject reference is unacceptable.(297) *òjè dé         ólí úkpùn dà ólì òkpòsò dé           ólí úkpùn?
       Oje PRP.buy the cloth or the woman PRP.buy the cloth
       ‘Did Oje buy the cloth or did the woman buy the cloth?’It is not only grammatical relations across clauses that require identity but also their
grammatical shapes. Thus, either lexical nouns or pronouns serve as clause subject
but not a lexical noun in one clause and a pronoun in the other. Similarly, direct
objects are constrained. Unacceptable are a lexical noun in one clause and a pro-
noun in the other.(298) a. *ólí ómòhè dé         ólí úkpùn dà ó ì        dè óì?

          ‘Did the man buy it or did he not buy the cloth?’In narrative discourse, disjunctive dà occurs with one clause ellipted. Either an
affirmative or negative clause is found preceded by da.34(299) dà ó dé         ólí úkpùn? / dà ó ì      dè ólí úkpùn?

    Perceptual verbs lacking intentionality (i.e. míé ‘see’) fail with kha in perfect condition clauses.(i) *ò khà       míé óvbí óì, ò gbé             évìè á.

     ‘When he saw his child, he burst into tears.’2
 Subordinate clauses in imperfect condition constructions require intentionality verbs. Verbs failing
to exhibit this property render the construction unacceptable.(i) *ò khà       áà míé òhí, ò ó            vbì ìwè.

     ‘Whevever he saw Ohi, he entered the house.’3
  Additional constructions reveal the positional properties of Recurrent a relative to auxiliaries and
other preverbs. When kha, Recurrent a, Anticipative lo and Anterior ke co-occur in the same clause,
Recurrent a precedes ló and ke and follows Hypothetical kha. When an imperfect condition subordi-
nate clause shows Anticipative, Ingressive and Anterior forms, Recurrent a precedes them but
follows the Hypothetical.(i) ólí éìn      khà     á ló     yà ké nwú émàè, ólí ényè fí               òrùn.
    the tortoise PRP.HYP RC ANTI IG ANT take food the snake PRP.throw voice
    ‘Whenever the tortoise wanted to take food afterward, the snake shouted.’When an indefinite condition subordinate clause shows relative tense Anterior ke and the Additive
aspectualizer gbo, Recurrent a follows both and immediately precedes the verb.(ii) ò khà       ké gbò áà é émàè léé, ò lá                  lé'.
     he PRP.HYP ANT ADD RC eat food TEMP he PRP.run depart
     ‘Whenever he finished eating food afterward, he ran away.’Likewise, when aspectualizers Punctual ghe and Additive gbo co-occur, Recurrent a follows them
but precedes the verb.(iii) a. ò khà       ghé gbò áà é émàè léé, ò lá                   lé'.

         ‘Whenever he just finished eating food too, he ran away.’When Additive gbo and a subject attributive (dégbè) or quantity (zézè) preverb are present, Recur-
rent a follows gbo.

        ‘Whenever he also ate a bit of food, he ran away.’Recurrent a can occur repeatedly in a subordinate clause and thus bring an emphatic quality to
indefinite condition constructions. Extensive reliance on this emphatic strategy is found in tradi-
tional narrative discourse. Emphatic structures require that Recurrent a precedes the verb and each
auxiliary or preverb except the Hypothetical.(v) a. ò khà         á gbó á vàdé, ò lá               lé'.

  Matrix clauses in prospective condition constructions correspond to émé'/émí' ‘what’ in ruan
‘happen’ questions with Predictive ló. Erstwhile subordinate information appears as si complement.
Responses correspond to matrix clause.(i) émé' ó ló      rùàn    sí     ó ó'     dè émà? >          ó ló       ù.

    ‘What will happen if he goes to buy yam?’                 ‘He will die.’5
  In addition, direct questions framed by émé'/émí', kha and ruan ‘happen’ elicit responses consist-
ing of matrix clause information from a possible counter-to-fact condition construction.(i) émé' ó khà        rúán?               > ólí ókpósó khà      ú.
    what it PAP.HYP happen                  the woman PAP.HYP die
    ‘What would have happened?’             ‘The woman would have died.’Clause information in possible counterfactual condition constructions does not correspond to ques-
tions framed by émé'/émí', kha, u ‘happen’ and a si-marked conditional clause. Questions with
erstwhile subordinate clause information in a si clause do not accept as response the erstwhile
matrix clause proposition.

     *áléké khà       ní.
      Aleke PAP.HYP survive
      ‘Aleke would have survived.’Counterfactuality grounded to a reversible condition is also framed by Deductive za in the matrix
clause and Hypothetical kha in the subordinate clause. Addition of kha to the matrix clause is unac-
ceptable.(iii) a. ó khà          béé vbí ó lì èdèdé, ò záà              fóó    óì.

          ‘If he had started it earlier, he would have finished it.’Properties of counterfactuals with kha and za in different clauses are constrained much as kha…kha
constructions. One essential difference concerns aspect. kha za frames inflect for Present perfect
(right edge low tone subject). They reject Past perfect.(iv) *ó khà         béé vbí ó lì èdèdé, ó zá'             fóó   óì.

  When condition si clauses accept relative tense kpe, they require Anticipative ló. As a conse-
quence, si clauses show a purposive rather than necessary condition interpretation. Condition si
clauses with purposive meaning reject Anterior ke.(i) ò ó sò íòò sì            òjè ló     kpè ré émì ní áìn.
    he C sing song COND Oje ANTI SUB take thing APP him

  The Concessive simple form re rarely serves to mark Concessive ‘although, even though’ relations
in multi-clause constructions.","[978, 979, 980, 981, 982, 983, 984, 985]"
"Relative to polarity and mood, ze predications are partially restricted. They appear
as imperatives, but not as prohibitives or negative statements. As polar questions

expresses an end state of exclusionary contact. In fact, V1 itself is a complex predi-
cate consisting of hian preceded by instrument verb re ‘take.’ hian in the ze complex
predicate requires a human noun direct object, e.g. òjè, while re takes only the body-
part noun óbò ‘hand.’ Predication sense is ‘exclude, restrain from, cut off,’ with
subject excluded from contact with the vbi complement referent. There is no corre-
sponding intransitive shape.(313) élí ívbèkhàn ré       óbò híán òjè zé           vbí úkpódè.

      the youths PRP.take hand cut Oje exclude
      ‘The youths excluded Oje by restraining him with their hands.’
      ‘The youths cut off Oje with their hands.’Complex predicates with ze are unacceptable without instrument re and its óbò
direct object.(315) *élí ívbèkhàn híán    òjè zé       (vbí úkpódè).
       the youths PRP.cut Oje exclude LOC road

tutes for the entire complex predicate re hian or simply hian.(316) a. *élí ívbèkhàn ú       óì zé        (vbí úkpódè).

          the youths PRP.use hand do him exclude LOC road
          ‘The youths excluded him (from the road).’     Complex ze predicates of exclusion do not deconstruct strictly. V1 consisting of
re óbò hian fails with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object. With NP2 as intransi-
tive subject, re óbò hian also fails.(317) *élí ívbèkhàn ré         óbò híán òjè. / *òjè ré         óbò híán.

       ‘The youths cut off Oje.’                ‘Oje got cut out.’Synchronically, V1 hian, in a transitive or intransitive frame, appears with sense
‘cut.’ It accepts inanimates as transitive direct object or intransitive subject. These
frames interact with the Change of State (CS) a particle (Chapter 9, 9.3.1.4).(318) a. òjè híán      ólí úì.     /     òjè híán      ólí úì    á.

      the man PRP.use cutlass cut the rope
      ‘The man used a cutlass to cut the rope.’V2 ze shows neither transitive nor intransitive shape with predication noun phrases.
It rejects NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object, and NP2 or NP1 as subject.(320) *è    zé           òjè (vbí úkpódè).     /   *òjè zé-ì.

       ‘They excluded Oje (from the road).’         ‘Oje got excluded.’
754 | Aspect expressing complex predicatesAs a simple synchronic predicate, ze fails, as seen in the preceding section’s discus-
sion of inclusion/penetration ze and reduplicated form zeze ‘congeal, become stiff.’
While no verb sense associated with ze seems related to exclusion, there is a mor-
pheme ze appearing in word formation that exhibits a potentially related sense. The
form ìzèzé ‘preoccupations’ occurs in constructions that have the sense ‘be preoccu-
pied, extremely focused to the exclusion of other matters.’ This sense, leading to an
end state of exclusion, may be the historical source of exclusion ze.(321) a. òjè ò ó là      ìzèzé.
         Oje SC C flow preoccupations
         ‘Oje is preoccupied.’

         ‘Ohi is preoccupied with Oje's child.’     Complex ze predicates of exclusion disclose additional properties when express-
ing aspect, aspectual interrogatives, polarity and mood, as well as argument reposi-
tioning in discourse. Complex predicates with exclusion ze restrict aspect. They
inflect for Present and Past perfect but not imperfect Continuous.(322) a. élí ívbékhán ré'       óbò híán òjè zé        vbí úkpódè.

Complex predicates express a contact and mixture relation with V2 baa in series. V1
consists of an object manipulation verb such as nwu ‘take hold,’ fi ‘throw,’ ku ‘cast’
or ze ‘scoop.’ Direct object referents of each verb are brought into contact and inter-
mingle to form a composite. Predication sense is ‘add to, mix up with.’ Locative
complements play no role in complex baa predications.(327) a. ójé nwú'      émà báá     ògèdè.
         Oje PAP.take yam add.to plantain
         ‘Oje added yam to the plantain / mixed yam with the plantain.’
      b. ójé zé'          ókà báá       ìkpèshè.
         Oje PAP.extract maize add.to beans
         ‘Oje added / scooped and mixed in maize with beans.’
      c. ójé zé'        ímòhè èvá báá       égbè.
         Oje PAP.select men two add.to SELF
         ‘Oje chose two men in addition to himself / added two men.’In V1 position, contact baa predications reject transitive pro-verb u ‘do.’(328) *òjè ú          óì báá     ògèdè.
       Oje PRP.do it add.to plantain
       ‘Oje added it to the plantain.’
756 | Aspect expressing complex predicates    Noun phrases in baa predications are restricted. NP2 and NP3 accept inanimates
referring to food (e.g. émà ‘yam,’ èbà ‘eba, cassava,’ ìkpèshè ‘bean,’ ókà ‘maize’).(329) ólí ómòhè fí        èbà báá émà.
      the man PRP.throw eba add.to yam
      ‘The man pounded / mixed / tossed in eba with the pounded yam.’However, NP2 and NP3 are strictly ordered. For instance, èbà as NP2 must precede
émà as NP3, and ókà as NP2 must precede ìkpèshè as NP3. Reversing this order is
unacceptable.(330) a. *ólí ómòhè fí         émà báá      èbà.
          the man PRP.throw yam add.to eba
          ‘The man added yam to the eba.’
      b. *ólí ómòhè kú           ìkpèshè báá    ókà.
          the man PRP.throw beans add.to maize
          ‘The man added beans to the maize.’Complex baa predications reveal no interrogative pronoun, e.g. émé' ‘what,’ corre-
sponding to NP3 or NP2.(331) a. *émé' òhí nwú'        émà báá?
          what Ohi PAP.take yam add.to
          ‘What did Ohi add to the yam?’
      b. *émé' òhí nwú'       báá     ògèdè?
          what Ohi PAP.take add.to plantain
          ‘What did Ohi add to the plantain?’In baa predications NP3 allows accusative pronouns (óì), as does NP2.(332) a. ólí ómòhè fí          óì báá   óì.
         the man PRP.throw it add.to it
         ‘The man added it with it.’
      b. ólí ómòhè kú           óì báá   óì.
         the man PRP.throw it add.to it
         ‘The man added them together.’    Complex predications with baa do not deconstruct strictly as simple verbs, alt-
hough the verbs share NP1. V1 object manipulation verbs appear with NP1 as subject

11.11 Forcible dispossession
Emai complex predicates characterize forcible dispossession of an entity vis-à-vis an
unmentioned event participant. V1 do ‘do in stealth’ expresses forcible disposses-
sion of NP2 by NP1. V2 consists of a transitive object manipulation verb (e.g. nwu
‘take a singleton,’ hua ‘take a plurality’) or a consumption activity verb (e.g. da
‘drink’). V2 expresses the resulting possession relationship between NP1 as posses-
sor and NP2 as possessum. English translation of predication sense engages the verb
steal or collocations of dispossession, e.g. carry off.(342) a. òjè dó                   ólí úkpùn nwú.

         Aleke PRP.do.in.stealth Oje wine drink
         ‘Aleke secretly drank Oje’s wine / stole Oje's wine to drink.’V2 position in complex dispossession predications rejects pro-verb u ‘do.’(343) *òjè dó                   óì ú.
       Oje PRP.do.in.stealth it do
       ‘Oje did it in stealth.’    Complex predicates with do fail to deconstruct strictly. V2, when transitive, oc-
curs with NP1 as subject and NP2 as direct object. V2 never occurs with NP2 as in-
transitive subject. As simple predicates, V2 forms assume a state of possessum ac-
quisition, their meanings contrasting with the loss asserted by complex
dispossession predicates.(344) a. òjè nwú        ólí úkpùn.
         Oje PRP.take the cloth
         ‘Oje carried the cloth.’
      b. òjè húá        élí íkpùn.
         Oje PRP.take the cloths
         ‘Oje carried the cloths.’As for V1 do, it does not occur as a transitive shape with NP1 as subject and NP2 as
direct object or as an intransitive shape with NP1 or NP2 as subject.

       ‘Oje stole the cloth.’                  ‘The cloth got stolen.’V1 do is not found with a related meaning as a simple synchronic predicate. Howev-
er, do from V1 position appears with activity verbs in complex predicates where it
conveys the manner sense ‘do in stealth, perform in secret.’ With an object manipu-
lation verb coding ritual change of possession (roo óhá ‘pick out a wife’), NP2 (óhá
‘wife’) appears after, not before, V2.(346) òjè dó                  róó     óhá óì.
      Oje PRP.do.in.stealth pick.out wife his
      ‘Oje secretly/in a stealthy manner took his wife.’With verbs of change of locative state or of activity, where no accusative noun
phrase follows do, the secretive manner of an event is asserted.(347) a. élí ívbèkhàn dó                 gáá    òjè.

sent and Past perfect but not imperfect Continuous.(348) a. òjè dó                  ólí úkpùn nwú.

Emai complex predicates articulate a state of resistance to a presumed change of
possession. V2 expresses resistance to possession change that results in retention of
possessum. Transitive verbs of object manipulation occur as V1 (e.g. nwu ‘take’).
Translation equivalents for the complex predications engage verbs hold, keep and
hide, respectively, with V2 forms moe, yaa and hee.

"5.9.2 Correlative conjunction khi… khiCorrelative noun phrases (CORC) marked by khi are severely constrained in their
occurrence across positions defined by grammatical relations and discourse. They
are restricted by number, animacy, syntactic shape, nominal type, and linear order.
282 | Pronouns and conjunctionIn principle there is no limit to the number of noun phrases correlated by khi forms,
although each correlated phrase requires an instance of khi.(113) a. khì émá khì ógédé, é           rì      vbì ékéín ìwè.
         CORC yam CORC plantain they PAP.be LOC inside house

      b. khì     émá khì    ógédé khì       ényó, é     rì     vbì ékéín ìwè.
         CORC yam CORC plantain CORC wine they PAP.be LOC inside house
         ‘As for yam, plantain and wine, they are in the house.’Negative correlative conjunctions of the English neither…nor type do not occur.
Instead, predicate negation in the matrix clause is used with similar effect.(114) khì ójé khì òhí, ósòsò               í ì      è vbí ìwè.
      CORC Oje CORC Ohi certain.ones SC NEG be LOC house
      ‘As for Oje and Ohi, neither one is in the house.’    Correlative khi phrases exhibit severe limitations on their distribution. They are
confined to topic position. Their corresponding position in the matrix clause re-
quires a plural anaphor (yan ‘they,’ é ‘they,’ íyàìn ‘them’). Singular resumptive pro-
nouns, such as indirect object áìn, are ungrammatical.(115) a. khì     éwé khì     ófé, yán à ò         vbí ìwè.

         CORC the dog CORC the cat           the man PRP.take food APP them it
         ‘As for the dog and the cat, the man gave food to them.’khi phrases never appear in any matrix clause grammatical relation: subject, direct
object, indirect object, or prepositional object. Similarly, khi phrases fail to appear
in discourse-defined positions other than topic. That is, they are not found in li/ni
focus position or in antitopic position.
     Correlative constituents exhibit severe restrictions as to shape. Correlative khi
phrases link two names (khì ójé khì òhí ‘both Oje and Ohi’), two modified nouns (khì
ólí ómóhé khì ólí óvbékhán ‘both the man and the youth’) or two bare, unmodified
nouns (khì éwé khì óókhó ‘both a goat and a chicken’). Correlative phrases do not
link unmodified nouns with modified nouns (*khì ólí ómóhé khì óvbékhán ‘both the
                                                                 Conjunction | 283man and a youth’). Moreover, Correlative khi phrases require number agreement
(*khì ólí ómóhé khì élí ívbékhán ‘both the man and the youths’).
    Correlative phrases restrict positioning of lexical nouns according to animacy
and number. They correlate an animate and an inanimate noun (khì éwé mè khì
úbélé mè ‘both my goat and my gourd’), two inanimate nouns (khì ólí ókpán khì ólí
úkpún ‘both the gourd and the cloth’) or two animate nouns (khì éwé khì óókhó ‘both
a goat and a chicken’). When Correlative phrases link human and nonhuman, ani-
mate nouns, the human noun precedes the animate noun (khì ójé khì ólí áwá ‘both
Oje and the dog,’ *khì ólí áwá khì ójé). When Correlative phrases link human and
inanimate nouns, the human noun precedes the inanimate noun (khì ójé khì úbélé
‘both Oje and his gourd,’ *khì úbélé khì ójé).
    Grammatical number restrictions further impact khi Correlative constructions.
Verbs that require a plural direct object such as hua ‘take hold, carry’ accept plural
anaphors that correspond to khi Correlatives in topic position, whereas verbs de-
manding singular direct objects such as nwu ‘take hold, carry’ do not.(116) khì     úkpún khì     ókpán, ólì òkpòsò húá        íyàìn / *óì.
      CORC cloth CORC gourd the woman PRP.take them it
      ‘As for a cloth and a gourd, the woman carried them.’   Correlative phrases reveal additional restrictions when pronouns are conjoined.
Each correlative position allows only emphatic pronouns when paired with a lexical
noun, as would be expected from their restriction to topic position.(117) a. khì     íyóín khì     ólí áwá, òjè nwú         émàè ní íyàìn.

         CORC the dog CORC it           Oje PRP.take food APP them
         ‘As for both the dog and it, Oje gave food to them.’Correlative khi positions disallow, however, exclusively emphatic pronouns, even
when number and animacy constraints are observed (*khì mémé khì wéwé ‘both me
and you’).","[307, 308, 309]"
"7.3.1 Matrix clause marking of topic relationA matrix clause grammatical relation corresponding to topic is marked in one of two
ways. For the grammatical relations subject, direct object, indirect object, locative,
and possessor, a pronoun is used. For nonlocative adverbial adjuncts, a zero pro-
noun is employed.
    When a topic constituent corresponds to matrix subject, direct object or indirect
object, a pronominal anaphor (or resumptive pronoun) appears in the respective
matrix position. The pronoun is obligatory. Pronoun form for third person for exam-
ple (o, óì, áìn) is determined by grammatical relation (subject, direct object and
indirect object, respectively) and number agreement vis-à-vis the topic constituent.(32) a. ólí ómòhè, ó shén'       ólí úkpùn lí      ólì òkpòsò.
        the man he PAP.sell the cloth APP the woman
        ‘As for the man, he sold the cloth to the woman.’
     b. ólí úkpùn, ólí ómòhè shén          óì lí    ólì òkpòsò.
        the cloth the man PRP.sell it APP the woman
        ‘As for the cloth, the man sold it to the woman.’
     c. ólì òkpòsò, ólí ómóhé shén'          ólí úkpùn ní áìn.
        the woman the man PAP.sell the cloth APP her
        ‘As for the woman, the man sold the cloth to her.’When the topic constituent corresponds to a possessor following Associative ísì, a
genitive pronoun (òí) in possessor position is obligatory.(33) ólì ònwìmè, éghó' ísì òí úé'-ì.
     the farmer money ASS his PAP.be.lost-F
     ‘As for the farmer, his money is lost.’When a topic constituent corresponds to complement of a vbi locative, either of two
marking strategies is followed. If the vbi phrase serves as an adjunct, anaphoric
locative pronoun o occupies complement position following vbi.
                                                               Topicalization | 363(34) a. ólì èkìn, ólí ómòhè shén         émí vbì ò.

     b. ólí ékóà, ólí ókpósó gbé'          vbì ò.
        the room the woman PAP.dance LOC it
        ‘As for the room, the woman danced in it.’When topic corresponds to complement of locative vbi serving as verb argument
(e.g. as with o ‘enter’), anaphoric o again occupies vbi complement position.(35) ólì ìwè, ólí ómóhé lá'          ó        vbì ò.
     the house the man PAP.run enter LOC it
     ‘As for the house, the man ran into it.’In contrast, when topic corresponds to a vbi complement serving an ablative ‘from’
relation for a verb of collection (sa ‘fetch’) or commerce (de ‘buy’), anaphoric o as-
sumes complement position. In addition, though, the verb in series za is obligatory
and precedes the vbi complement. Corresponding canonical structures do not show
za (*ólí ómòhè zá vbí ólí édà sá ámé [the man PRP.be.loc LOC the river fetch water]
‘The man fetched water at the river’, *ólí ómóhé zá' vbì ólì èkìn dé ògèdè [the man

        the market the man PAP.be.loc LOC it buy plantain
        ‘As for the market, the man bought plantain from it.’Still another strategy for matrix clause marking of the position corresponding to
topic involves a zero pronoun. It applies to nonlocative adverbial adjuncts.9 When a
topic constituent corresponds to a temporal adverbial adjunct (élélá òdè, òhínà òdè),
adjunct position in the matrix clause is unmarked.(37) a. élélá òdè,       áléké dé'        ògèdè.
        TP yesterday Aleke PAP.buy plantain
        ‘As for the yesterday we discussed, Aleke had bought plantain then.’

        this.time yesterday, Aleke PRP.buy plantain TEMP
        ‘As for this time yesterday, Aleke had already bought plantain.’
364 | Noncanonical constructions7.3.2 Topic position nominal constraintsNoun phrase exponents in topic position are restricted. There are few nominal con-
straints but pronominal and modifier types are limited.
     Topic allows proper nouns, e.g. òlólò ‘Ololo’ as well as count and mass nouns.(38) òlólò, ó gbé'        ólí ófè.
     Ololo he PAP.kill the rat
     ‘As for Ololo, he killed the rat.’Common nouns (human ómòhè, nonhuman animate ófè, inanimate úkpùn or place
èkìn) appear in topic position, although each must be grammatically marked as
information shared by speaker and hearer. Noun types with the definite article are
thus acceptable while bare nouns are not.10(39) a. ólí ómòhè / *ómòhè, ó gbé'             ólí ófè.
        the man          man     he PAP.kill the rat
        ‘As for the man, he killed the rat.’
     b. ólí ófè / *ófè, ólí ókpósó gbé'          óì.
        the rat     rat the woman PAP.kill it
        ‘As for the rat, the woman killed it.’
     c. ólí úkpùn / *úkpùn, ójé shén'          óì lí   ólì òkpòsò.
        the cloth       cloth Oje PAP.sell it APP the woman
        ‘As for the cloth, Oje sold it to the woman.’
     d. ólì èkìn / *èkìn, ójé zá'               vbì ò dé úkpùn.
        the market market Oje PAP.be.loc LOC it buy cloth
        ‘As for the market, Oje bought the cloth from there.’     Topic position limits modifiers from each of the classes demonstrative, kindred,
numeral and quantifier. Demonstratives in topic position are not restricted. Deictic
demonstratives proximal nà and distal áìn occur with human nouns and the definite
article (ólí ómóhé nà / áìn, ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man this that he PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for
this / that man, he killed the rat’). Contrastive demonstrative nóì, which never ac-
cepts the definite article, also appears in topic position (ómóhé nóì, ó gbé' ólí ófè
[man next he PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the next man, he killed the rat’).
     Topic position allows kindred modifiers, both deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn
(éwé élìyó / ódàn á ré' óì zé ìzòbò [goat that.kind different.kind one PAP.take it make
sacrifice] ‘As for that kind of / a different kind of goat, it is used to make a sacrifice’).
     Only one quantifier type occurs in topic position. Existential quantifiers (parti-
tive ósò and contrastive óvbèé) never do. But universal quantifiers without definite
ólí/élí appear in topic position: distributive òdóòdé ((*élí) ímóhé òdóòdé, é ó' vbì ìwè
                                                                   Topicalization | 365[the men each they PAP.enter LOC house] ‘As for each of the men, they entered the
house’) and collective èrèmé ((*élí) éwé èrèmé, é ó' vbì ìwè [the goats all they
PAP.enter LOC house] ‘As for all the goats, they entered the house’).
     Topic position accepts cardinal numerals, e.g. èvá ‘two,’ but not with the defi-
nite article ((*élì) éfè èvá, é ó' vbì òò [the rats two they PAP.enter LOC hole] ‘As for
the two rats, they entered the hole’). Numeral òkpá ‘one’ appears as sole modifier for
a topic nominal (ómòhè òkpá, ó ó' vbì ìwè [man one he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘As for
one man, he entered the house’), but its emphatic partitive phonological twin with
the sense ‘alone’ requires the definite article (ólí ómòhè òkpá, ó ó' vbì ìwè [the man
alone he PAP.enter LOC house] ‘As for the man alone, he entered the house’).
     Topic position nominals with an optional definite article accept as a modifier
Associative ísì ((ólí) éwé ísì ólì òkpòsò, ó ó' vbì ìwè [the goat ASS the woman it
PAP.enter LOC house] ‘As for the woman's goat, it entered the house’), Relator lí
((ólí) éwé lí óbín', ó ó' vbì ìwè [the goat R dark it PAP.enter LOC house] ‘As for the
dark goat, it entered the house’), and relative clause lí ((ólí) ómóhé lí ó dá' ólí ényò, ó
gbé' ólí ófè [the man R he PAP.drink the wine he PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the man
who drank the wine, he killed the rat’).
     In topic position, pronouns are relatively unrestricted. Topic accepts only one
personal pronoun type but a range of impersonal pronouns. Emphatic personal
pronouns (e.g. ìyòìn, ìyàìn) appear as topics when they agree in number and person
with their matrix clause anaphor (ó and yán, respectively).(40) ìyòìn / ìyàìn, ó / yán gbé'           ólí ófè.
     he      they he they PAP.kill the rat
     ‘As for him / them, he / they killed the rat.’Emphatic pronouns in topic position accept some postnominal modifiers. Included
among the latter are collective numerals (e.g. èvèvá ‘both’) with plural pronouns
and emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone’ with emphatic singular pronouns.(41) a. íyáín èvèvá, yán gbé'         ólí ófè.
        they both they PAP.kill the rat
        ‘As for both of them, they killed the rat.’
     b. ìyòìn òkpá, ó gbé'         ólí ófè.
        he     alone he PAP.kill the rat
        ‘As for him alone, he killed the rat.’     Topic position accepts impersonal pronouns from demonstrative, kindred, nu-
meral and quantifier classes with few restrictions. Topic position allows demonstra-
tive pronouns: deictic óáìn and ònà (óáìn / ònà, ó gbé' ólí ófè [that.one this.one it
PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for that one / this one, it killed the rat’) as well as contrastive
366 | Noncanonical constructionsónóì (ónóì, ó gbé' ólí ófè [next.one it PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the next one, it killed the
rat’). Topic position also permits emphatic proximal deictic ónánà (ónánà, ó gbé' ólí
ófè [this.very.one it PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for this very one, it killed the rat’).
     Numeral pronouns greater than ‘one’ in topic position are grammatical. They
include forms that are cardinal (e.g. èvá ‘two’) or collective (e.g. èvèvá ‘both, all
two’): (èvá / èvèvá, ólí ókpósó gbóó' íyàìn [two all.two the woman PAP.kill them] ‘As
for two / both, the woman killed them’). However, only cardinal forms occur in topic
position as head of partitive vbi phrases (èvá / *èvèvá vbì ò, ólí ókpósó gbóó' íyàìn
[two both LOC it the woman PAP.kill them] ‘As for two of them, the woman killed
them’). Collective numerals never do.
     Topic position restricts numeral pronoun òkpá ‘one,’ even as head of a partitive
phrase. But emphatic úkpòkpá ‘one’ as partitive vbi phrase head does occur
(úkpòkpá vbì ò / *òkpá, ólí ókpósó gbé' óì [one LOC it one the woman PAP.kill it] ‘As
for one of them, the woman killed it’).
     As topic, quantifier pronouns appear with some limitations. Among universal
quantifiers, collective èrèmé occurs but distributive òdóòdé does not: (èrèmé /
*òdóòdé, ólí ókpósó gbóó' íyàìn [all each the woman PAP.kill them] ‘As for all, the
woman killed them’). Neither universal quantifier occurs as head of a topic position
partitive vbi phrase. Existential partitive quantifier ósò appears in topic position
alone or as head of a partitive vbi phrase (ósò / ósó vbì ò, ólí ókpósó gbé' óì [cer-
tain.one certain.one LOC it the woman PAP.kill it] ‘As for a certain one / a certain
one of them, the woman killed it’). Contrastive existential óvbèé fails in topic posi-
tion, even if head of a partitive vbi phrase (*óvbèé / óvbèé vbì ò, ólí ókpósó gbé' óì
[another.one another.one LOC it the woman PAP.kill it] ‘As for another one / anoth-
er one of them, the woman killed it’).
     In topic position one type of kindred pronoun is grammatical. Kindred deictic
élìyó occurs (élìyó, ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [that.kind.one the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for that
kind of one, the man killed it’), whereas contrastive kindred ódàn does not (*ódàn,
ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [different.kind.one the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for a different kind of
one, the man killed it’). In addition, neither kindred form appears in topic position
when head of a partitive vbi phrase.
     Topic position permits two additional pronominals. It allows attributive phrases
(ólí óbín', ó gbé' ólí ófè [the dark.one he PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the dark one, he
killed the rat’) and pronominally headed relative clauses (ólí ó dé' ólí úkpùn, ó gbé'
ólí ófè [one he PAP.buy the cloth he PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the one who bought the
cloth, he killed the rat’).11

and mood as well as auxiliaries and preverbs. Constructions with a nominal in topic
position show all polarity and mood types. They appear as negative statements (émá
lì òdè, ólí ómóhé í ì shèn óì [yam R yesterday the man SC NEG sell it] ‘As for the yam
from yesterday, the man did not sell it’), polar questions (ólì émà, ólí ómóhé shén' óì?
[the yam the man PAP.sell it] ‘As for the yam, did the man sell it?’), imperatives (ólí
ófé nà, tòn óì [the rat this roast it] ‘As for this rat, roast it’) or prohibitives (ólí émá nà,
é è shén óì [the yam this you PR sell it] ‘As for this yam, don't sell it’).
     Matrix clauses in topic constructions minimally restrict inflectional and auxilia-
ry forms. They inflect for each perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.12(42) a. ólí émà, ólí ómóhé shén'         óì.
        the yam the man PAP.sell it
        ‘As for the yam, the man sold it.’
     b. ólí émà, ólì ómòhè shén           óì.
        the yam the man PRP.sell it
        ‘As for the yam, the man has sold it.’
     c. ólí úkpùn, ólí ómóhé ó ò wèè óì.

        ‘As for the cloth, the man wears it.’
     d. ólí úkpùn, ólí ómòhè ò ó wèè óì.
        the cloth the man SC C wear it
        ‘As for the cloth, the man is wearing it.’
     e. ólí émà, ólí ómóhé ló         shèn óì.
        the yam the man PRED sell it
        ‘As for this yam, the man will sell it.’
     f. ólí émà, ólí ómòhè ló        shèn óì.
        the yam the man ANTI sell it
        ‘As for this yam, the man is about to sell it.’As selected modality examples indicate, topic construction matrix clauses do not
restrict their occurrence. Topic constructions allow deontic Hortative í (ólí émà, ólí
ómòhè í shèn óì [the yam the man HOR sell it] ‘As the yam, the man should sell it’).
They permit auxiliaries from each epistemic judgment type, including rational Re-
sultative za and Deductive za (ólí émà, ólí ómòhè záà shén óì [the yam the man
PRP.DED sell it] ‘As for the yam, the man must have sold it’), speculative Certaintive
ma (ólí émà, ólí ómóhé má' shén óì [the yam the man PAP.CER sell it] ‘As for the yam,
the man surely sold it’), Dubitatives vba and bia, as well as assumptive Hypothetical
368 | Noncanonical constructionskha and Concessive rere (ólí émà, ólí ómóhé ré'rè shén óì [the yam the man
PAP.CONC sell it] ‘As for the yam, the man even sold it’).13
     Topic construction matrix clauses do not restrict relative tense. They allow An-
terior ke (ólí émà, ólí ómóhé ké' shén óì [the yam the man PAP.ANT sell it] ‘As for the
yam, the man sold it afterward’) and Subsequent kpe (ólí émà, ólí ómóhé kpé' shén óì
[the yam the man PAP.SUB sell it] ‘As for the yam, the man sold it despite forthcom-
ing conditions’).
     In topic constructions, preverbs are minimally constrained. It is only temporal
preverbs (kpao ‘initially,’ bobo ‘promptly’ and tua ‘hurriedly’) that fail. Topic con-
struction matrix clauses allow all aspectualizer preverbs: phasal Repetitive che,
Additive gbo, Durative se and Punctual ghe in addition to boundary Conative òó,
Ingressive ya, Egressive mo and Past Absolutes ya and mo. Selected examples with
se and òó illustrate aspectualizer behavior: (ólí émà, ólí ómóhé sé' fóló óì [the yam
the man PAP.DUR peel it] ‘As for the yam, the man still peeled it’) and (ólí émà, ólí
ómòhè ó ó' shèn óì [the yam the man SC CON sell it] ‘As for the yam, the man went to
sell it’).
     Additional preverbs appearing in topic construction matrix clauses are evalua-
tives duu ‘for no reason,’ woo ‘instead,’ kuku ‘after all’ and manner-demonstratives
ìná and ìyó. Selected examples with ìyó and duu support this generalization: (ólí
émà, ólí ómóhé íyó' é óì [the yam the man PAP.DMD eat it] ‘As for the yam, the man
ate it that way’) and (ólí émà, ólí ómòhè dúù é óì [the yam the man PRP.EVAL eat it]
‘As for the yam, the man ate it for no reason’).
     In topic construction matrix clauses, one also finds subject attributive preverbs.
In fact, dábo ‘deliberately,’ dóbo ‘mistakenly,’ dúda ‘defiantly,’ miti ‘able,’ gbúdu
‘courageously,’ dégbe ‘carefully,’ totóbo ‘intensely’ and kakégbe ‘perseveringly’ are
each grammatical. Two illustrative constructions show dábo (ólí ómóhé nà, ó dá'bò fí
ólì èkpà fí à [the man this he PAP.deliberately threw the bag propel CS] ‘As for this
man, he deliberately threw the bag away’) and miti (ólí ómóhé nà, ó mí'tì gbé ólí éwè
[the man this he PAP.able kill the goat] ‘As for this man, he was able to kill the
goat’).
     Matrix clauses in topic constructions permit each quantity preverb. Suggestive
examples illustrate with Collective gba (ólí émà, élí ímóhé gbá' é óì [the yam the men
PAP.COL eat it] ‘As for the yam, the men ate it together’) and Nonabsolute Intensifier
zeze (ólí ómóhé nà, ó zé'zè é vbì ólí émà [the man this he PAP.NABI eat LOC the yam]
‘As for this man, he ate a bit of the yam’).
     Topic constructions evince additional constraints under conditions of subordi-
nation. Topic constructions occur in indicative khi complements when a copy of khi
precedes not only the topic constituent (ólí ómòhè) but also its following matrix
clause (ó é ólí émà). Chapter 13 includes further discussion. However, topic con-
structions never appear in conditional si or subjunctive li complements, even under
conditions of complement marker doubling.

     Oje PRP.know-F IND the man IND he PAP.eat the yam
     ‘Oje knew that as for the man, he ate the yam.’Topic constructions provide an equally mixed impression with other subordinate
clause types. Topic constituents are acceptable with subordinate temporal clauses
marked by Anterior ke. However, they are not permissible within purposive clauses
marked by subjunctive li (*òjè yé òkè lí ìyòìn, ó mìè éhé rè fí ísè [Oje move.to Oke
SUBJ he he find opportunity use throw seeds] ‘Oje went to Oke in order that as for
himself, he should play ayo’).(44) ólí ómòhè, ò kéè            é émàè léé,      ó shén'     ólí émà.
     the man      he PRP.ANT eat food TEMP he PAP.sell the yam
     ‘As for the man, after he finished eating food, he sold the yam.’7.4 Right dislocation / antitopic
Right dislocation (RD) or antitopic constructions consist of two major constituents, a
matrix clause with a falling intonation contour followed by a constituent wherein a
noun phrase is preceded by Equational Identity copula khi and its obligatory Identi-
ty subject pronoun í. A right dislocated constituent functions to identify the referent
of a matrix clause grammatical relation assumed by the speaker to be unclear.(45) ólí ómóhé shén'      óì, í khì ólí émà.
     the man PAP.sell it ID be the yam
     ‘The man sold it, that is the yam.’RD constructions constrain syntactic shape of the right dislocated constituent and
restrict matrix clause inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs. RD occurrence in embed-
ded or subordinate clauses is also limited. As for RD position itself, it corresponds to
grammatical relations subject, monotransitive direct object and locative argument,
with additional restrictions imposed on those relations.","[388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395]"
"7.2 Predicate focus
Predicate focus constructions exhibit a focus constituent with a nominalized verb
followed by a matrix clause. In focus position, they employ the matrix clause verb’s
gerundive form (uVERBmi) (Chapter 2, 2.3.2). Regardless of positive or negative fo-
cus, these constructions are highly constrained and very infrequently used. More so
than nominal focus, predicate focus constructions severely constrain modifiers in
focus position as well as auxiliaries and preverbs in their matrix clause.
     Positive and negative focus particles differentially constrain focus position ge-
rundive constituents. With unmodified gerundive nominals in focus position, the
positive focus particle itself is optional.(25) úkhùmí (lí) òhí khú'         ólí éwè.
     chasing PF Ohi PAP.chase the goat
     ‘Chasing is what Ohi did to the goat.’The negative focus particle never appears with an unmodified gerundive in focus
position. It only occurs with gerundives that are modified.(26) úkhùmí lì kéré / *úkhùmí kí òhí khú'               ólí éwè.
     chasing R small chasing NF Ohi PAP.chase the goat
     ‘It was not a little chasing that Ohi did to the goat.’Gerundive nominals in focus position limit postdeterminers. Gerundive údàmí ‘be-
ing tall’ derived from stative da ‘be tall’ allows contrastive kindred ódàn ‘different
kind’ as well as unmarked attributive phrases, e.g. óbè ‘bad.’ údàmí never accepts
deictic kindred, demonstratives, numerals or quantifiers.
360 | Noncanonical constructions(27) a. údàmí       ódàn           lí ólí óvbékhán dá'-ì.

        ‘It was a different kind of being tall that the youth showed.’
     b. údàmí óbè / *údàmí         lí ólí óvbékhán dá'-ì.
        tallness bad being.tall PF the youth           PAP.be.tall-F
        ‘It was extraordinary tallness that the youth showed.’    Predicate focus constructions severely constrain expression of polarity and
mood. They do not appear as negative statements, imperatives, prohibitives or polar
interrogatives, as unacceptable interrogatives suggest (*úkhùmí lí òhí khú' ólí éwè?
[chasing PF Ohi PAP.chase the goat] ‘Was it chasing that Ohi did to the goat?’).
    Matrix clauses in predicate focus constructions are additionally constrained.
They limit inflection and accept no auxiliaries or preverbs. They inflect for Past
perfect but not Present perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect. Predicate focus
matrix clauses also reject auxiliary marking. They disallow deontic or epistemic
modality, in addition to relative tense. As well, matrix clauses with gerundive focus
do not accept any preverbs. Regarding subordination, predicate focus constructions
never appear under indicative, conditional or subjunctive S-complements, as unac-
ceptable predicate focus under indicative khi suggests (*òjè één-í khí úkhùmí lí ólí
ómóhé khú' ólí éwè [Oje PRP.know-F IND chasing PF the man PAP.chase the goat]
‘Oje knew that it was chasing that the man did to the goat’).(28) úkhùmí lí ólí ómóhé khú'            ólí éwè.
     chasing PF the man PAP.chase the goat
     ‘It was chasing that the man did to the goat.’    Turning to focus position, it reveals a number of conditions that constrain ge-
rundives. Gerundives appear only under contrastive conditions where an alternative
event exists which could have affected the subject of an intransitive verb or the
direct object of a transitive verb. The verbs lo ‘grind,’ shen ‘sell’ and e ‘eat’ in gerun-
dive form appear in predicate focus position when the speaker seeks to contrast the
hearer’s assumed knowledge state with his own.(29) a. úlòmí      lí ólí ómóhé ló'           ólí ókà.
        grinding PF the man PAP.grind the maize

        ‘It was selling that the man did to the cloth for Aleke.’
        ‘Selling is what the man did to the cloth for Aleke.’ (not buy it)
                                                                   Topicalization | 361    c. úèmí lí ólí ómóhé é'            ólí ókà.
       eating PF the man PAP.eat the maize
       ‘It was eating that the man did to the maize.’
       ‘What the man did to the maize was eat it.’ (not sell it)Predicate focus constructions are highly dependent on speaker understanding of
hearer assumptions about situational context, since those assumptions are the basis
for invoking the contrastive function of focus. For action verbs with complex com-
plements (e.g. de ‘buy’), verb complement contrast appears pragmatically difficult
to construe.8 The same is true for communication and cognition verbs (e.g. ta
‘speak’). And for stative verbs (rere ‘be far’), readily available contrastive conditions
are not easily discernable outside of very specific contexts.(30) a. *údèmí lí ójé dé'          ólí úkpún vbí óbó ísì àlèkè.
         buying PF Oje PAP.buy the cloth LOC hand ASS Aleke
         ‘It was buying that Oje did with the cloth from Aleke.’
     b. *útàmí      lí ójé tá'          étà lí     àlèkè hòn.

         being.far PF the village PAP.be.far-F
         ‘It was far away that the village was.’Predicate focus position selectively affects verbs in series. With motion events ex-
pressed by a manner verb (sua ‘push’ or la ‘run’) and a direction verb (o ‘enter’), the
gerundive nominal in focus position corresponds to manner, not direction (*úòmí lí
ólí ómóhé súá' ólì èkpètè / lá' ó vbí ékóà [entering PF the man PAP.push the stool
PAP.run enter LOC room] ‘It was by entering that the man pushed the stool / ran
into the room’).(31) a. úsùámì lí ólí ómóhé súá'            ólì èkpètè ó       vbí ékóà.
        pushing PF the man PAP.push the stool enter LOC room
        ‘It was pushing that the man did to get the stool into the room.’
     b. úlàmí lí ólí ómó lá'             ó     vbí ékóà.
        running PF the child PAP.run enter LOC room
        ‘It was running that the child did to enter the room.’7.3 Topicalization
Topic (left-dislocation) constructions manifest two structural constituents. They
exhibit a topic in leftmost position characterized by falling intonation (represented
362 | Noncanonical constructionsorthographically by a comma) and a matrix clause in which the topic bears a gram-
matical relation. Topic position holds information shared by speaker and hearer.
The matrix clause expresses nonshared information.
    Topic constructions limit the syntactic character of topic position and its matrix
clause. In the matrix clause, grammatical marking of the position corresponding to
topic differs from that in focus constructions, as does the distribution of auxiliaries
and preverbs.","[385, 386, 387, 388]"
"8.2.2 Age construction u / vbiIn age constructions, the forms u and vbi occur in complementary distribution or
they alternate freely. This alternation reminds one of the nominal classifying copula
u/vbi (Chapter 8, 8.1.3). However, the copula form does not allow deontic and epis-
temic modality auxiliary forms. Age constructions do. Emai age constructions thus
employ transitive u ‘do’ where English relies on ‘be.’(102) a. ú ló        vbì / ù íkpè ìíhéén ákhò.
         you PRED do do years five tomorrow
         ‘You will be five years old tomorrow.’
      b. éénà lí ó khà             vbí / ú íkpè ìgbé.
         today PF she PAP.HYP do do years ten
         ‘It is today that she would have been ten years old.’
466 | Be, do, happen and haveIn other age constructions, u and vbi do not alternate. Instead, the u form appears in
sentence final position, while its direct object nominal occupies focus position.(103) a. íkpé ékà       lí ú / í ù?
         year quantity PF you I PAP.do
         ‘How old are you / am I?’
      b. íkpé ékà       lí yán ù?
         year quantity PF they PAP.do
         ‘How old are they?’8.2.3 Intransitive uIntransitive u has the sense ‘do.’ When it occurs with a manner adjunct such as
lèsèn ‘well,’ ìyó ‘that way’ or ìná ‘this way,’ it contributes to construction sense ‘act,
behave, perform.’ Noun phrase and verb phrase properties in intransitive u con-
structions are partially constrained. It is the case, however, that intransitive u shows
polarity and mood potential and allows discourse repositioning of its arguments.(104) a. ólí óvbèkhàn ú          lèsèn.
         the youth      PRP.do well
        ‘The youth acted / performed / behaved / did well.’
      b. ólí óvbékhán ú'         ìyó.
         the youth      PAP.do DMD
         ‘The youth acted / performed / behaved that way / did so.’
      c. ólí óvbèkhàn ú          ìná.
         the youth      PRP.do PMD
         ‘The youth has acted / performed this way / did so.’     Intransitive u constructions do not constrain polarity and mood. They appear as
imperatives (ù ìyó [do DMD] ‘Act that way’), prohibitives (é è ú ìyó [you PR do DMD]
‘Don't act that way’), negative statements (ólì òkpòsò í ì ù ìyó [the woman SC NEG do
DMD] ‘The woman did not act that way’), and polar interrogatives (ólí ókpósó ú' ìyó?
[the woman PAP.do DMD] ‘Did the woman perform / act that way?’).
     The initial noun phrase in intransitive u constructions reveals subject proper-
ties. It permits nominative pronouns for each person and number. Even the indefi-
nite subject pronoun is admitted, although only with imperfect aspect.(105) ì / ù / ò ú            ìyó.    /     á à ù ìyó.

ternal syntactic shape. They allow human nouns, proper (àlèkè) and common
(óvbèkhàn), as well as nonhuman animate nouns (áwà). Except for proper nouns,
each requires elaboration by, for instance, the definite article. Bare common nouns
are unacceptable. Intransitive u subject rejects inanimate common nouns, even
when definite (*ólí ópíá ú' ìyó ‘The cutlass performed that way’).(106) a. áléké ú'       ìyó.

         the dog     dog PAP.do DMD
         ‘The dog behaved / performed that way.’     In intransitive u subject position, postdeterminers are minimally constrained.
One finds demonstratives nà and áìn (ólí óvbékhán nà / áìn ú ìná [the youth this that
PRP.do PMD] ‘This / That youth acted this way’) in addition to contrastive nóì (óvbé-
khán nóí ú' ìyó [youth next PAP.do DMD] ‘The next youth acted that way’), existen-
tial partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé (óvbékhán ósó / óvbèé ú' ìyó [youth some
another PAP.do DMD] ‘Some / Another youth acted that way’), universal quantifiers
collective èrèmé ((élí) ívbékhán èrèmé ú' ìyó [the youths all PAP.do DMD] ‘All the
youths acted that way’) and distributive òdóòdé (ívbékhán òdóòdé ú' ìyó [youths
each PAP.do DMD] ‘Each youth acted that way’), and numerals, e.g. cardinal èvá
((élí) ívbèkhàn èvá ú' ìyó [ the youths two PAP.do DMD] ‘The two / Two youths acted
that way’) and e.g. collective èvèvá (ívbékhán èvèvá ú' ìyó [youths both PAP.do DMD]
‘Both youths acted that way’). Intransitive u subjects reject kindred élìyó and ódàn.
     Intransitive u subject position allows most impersonal pronouns: demonstrative
deictic ònà (ònà ú ìná [this.one PRP.do PMD] ‘This one acted this way’) as well as
deictic óáín and contrastive ónóí (ónóí / óáín ú' ìyó [next.one that.one PAP.do DMD]
‘The next one / That one acted that way’), universal quantifiers collective èrèmé and
distributive òdóòdé (èrèmé / òdóòdé ú' ìyó [all each.one PAP.do DMD] ‘All / Each one
acted that way’), existential quantifiers partitive ésò and contrastive évbèé (ésó /
évbèé ú' ìyó [certain.ones other.ones PAP.do DMD] ‘Certain ones / Other ones acted
that way’) in addition to numerals such as cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá (èvá /
èvèvá ú' ìyó [two both PAP.do DMD] ‘Two / Both acted that way’). Cardinal forms
also appear as head of partitive phrases (èvá vbí élí ívbékhán ú' ìyó [two LOC the
youths PAP.do DMD] ‘Two of the youths acted that way’, úkpòkpá vbí élí á ló shèn ú
ìyó [one LOC ones one PRED sell PRP.do DMD] ‘One of the ones that will be sold
468 | Be, do, happen and haveacted that way’). However, intransitive u subject rejects kindred pronouns élìyó and
ódàn.
    Intransitive u subject and adjunct positions correspond to constituents in dis-
course defined positions. Subject corresponds to a focus li/ni or a topic constituent.(107) a. ólí ómòhè lí ó ú'            ìyó.

         the man he PRP.do DMD
         ‘As for the man, he acted that way.’Manner adjuncts with intransitive u occupy focus position provided Manner preverb
i/e precedes u in the matrix clause. Intransitive u manner-demonstrative adjuncts
never assume topic position.(108) ìyó lí ólí ómóhé í'             ù.
      DMD PF the man PAP.MAN do
      ‘It was that way that the man acted.’Intransitive u grammatical positions correspond to distinct interrogative pronouns.
Subjects correspond only to interrogative pronoun óé'. Adjuncts correspond to
manner questions framed by ébé'...i. Responses require a manner constituent in situ,
not in focus position.(109) a. óé' ó ú'         ìyó?

         ‘He behaved that way.’     Intransitive u constructions with manner demonstrative adjuncts restrain the
expression of verb phrase properties. Although intransitive u disallows verbal affix-
es, it selectively occurs with inflection, auxiliary, preverb, postverbal particle and
temporal adjunct categories. Relative to verbal affixes, intransitive u accepts neither

imperfect Habitual and Continuous as well as prospective Predictive. It rejects pro-
spective Anticipative (*ólí ómóhè ló ù ìná [the man ANTI do PMD] ‘The man is about

      e. ólí ómóhé ló       ù ìyó.
         the man PRED do DMD
         ‘The man will act that way.’     Intransitive u constructions limit auxiliaries. They permit deontic Hortative (ò í
ù ìná [he HOR do PMD] ‘He should perform this way’) and epistemic Hypothetical
kha (ó khà ú ìyó [he PAP.HYP act DMD] ‘He would have acted that way’), Concessive
rere (ó ré'rè ú ìyó? [he PAP.CONC do DMD] ‘Did he even act that way?’), Deductive za
(ò záà ú ìná [he PRP.DED act PMD] ‘He must have acted this way’) and Resultative za
(ó zá' ú ìyó [he PAP.RES act DMD] ‘As a result, he acted that way’). No other epistem-
ic forms occur, particularly speculative Dubitatives vba and bia, and Certaintive ma.
     In a more severe fashion, intransitive u restrains relative tense. It rejects Subse-
quent kpe, and Anterior ke, as unacceptable ke suggests (*ó ké' ú ìyó [he PAP.ANT
do DMD] ‘He acted that way afterward’).
     Intransitive u limits preverbs. It disallows manner-demonstrative preverbs ìná
and ìyó. With aspectualizers, intransitive u permits some phasal forms, permitting
Repetitive che (ò chéè ú ìyó [he PRP.REP do DMD] ‘He acted that way again’) and
Additive gbo (ò gbóò ú ìyó [he PRP.ADD do DMD] ‘He acted that way too’) but not
Durative se or Punctual ghe. Intransitive u allows only the boundary aspectualizer
Past Absolute ya (ólí ómóhé yà ú ìyó [the man PAP.PA do DMD] ‘The man used to act
that way’). It rejects Past Absolute mo, Ingressive ya, Egressive mo and Conative òó.
     Intransitive u admits only one evaluative preverb, kuku (ólí ómóhé kú'kù ú ìyó
[the man PAP.POEV do DMD] ‘The man afterall acted that way’). It rejects duu ‘for no
reason’ and woo ‘instead.’
470 | Be, do, happen and have     Relative to remaining preverbs, intransitive u accepts only a few. It allows one
temporal preverb, kpao (ólí ómóhé kpá'ò ú ìyó [man PAP.earlier do DMD] ‘The man
acted that way earlier on’), and two subject attributive forms, dóbo (ólí ómóhé dó'bò
ú ìyó [the man PAP.mistakenly do DMD] ‘The man mistakenly acted that way’) and
gbúdu (ólí ómóhé gbú'dù ú ìyó [the man PAP.courageously do DMD] ‘The man coura-
geously acted that way’). It disallows temporal bobo ‘promptly,’ tua ‘hurriedly’ and
gue ‘unexpectedly’ as well as subject attributives dábo ‘deliberately,’ miti ‘able,’
dúda ‘defiantly,’ kekégbe ‘perseveringly,’ dégbe ‘carefully,’ and totóbo ‘intensely.’
     Intransitive u restricts quantity preverbs as well. It accepts Emphatic Reflexive
dobo (ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì ú ìyó [the man PAP.REFL him do DMD] ‘The man himself
acted that way’) and Collective gba (élí ímóhé gbá' ú ìyó [the men PAP.COL do DMD]
‘The men together acted that way’). However, intransitive u rejects Absolute Intensi-
fier zemi and Nonabsolute Intensifier zeze.
     Relative to postverbal forms, intransitive u constructions are generally more tol-
erant. Intransitive u permits a temporal particle as well as deictic adverbs. It allows
Temporal Perspective lee but not Temporal Degree gbe (ólí ókpósó ú' ìyó léé / *gbé
[the woman PAP.do DMD TEMP much] ‘The woman acted that way already / fin-
ished acting that way’). With appropriate inflection, intransitive u accepts deictic
adjuncts for past (òdè), recent past (èghéènà), future (ákhò), immediate present
(ènyáà) and, with adjunct modification, ‘today’ (éènà).(111) a. ólí ókpósó ú'        ìyó òdè.

properties that refer to event intensity or sound. Ideophonic forms thus appear to
ascribe a property to an event rather than to a nominal referent. Constructions de-
fined by u and ideophones inflect only for Past perfect.(112) a. ólí ákhé ú'          bèkhé.

         ‘The tree thudded / did a thud.’Information questions corresponding to u ideophone subjects are framed by émé'
‘what.’ Responses require the subject in situ, not as a simple noun phrase.(113) émé' ó ú'        bìán?

The verb u with sense ‘happen’ occurs in transitive and intransitive constructions.
Each construction exhibits highly restricted syntactic patterns.(114) a. émí ósò       í ì     ù        ólí ómòhè.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to the man
         ‘Nothing happened to the man.’
472 | Be, do, happen and have      b. ò kéè         ú,      ó vá'rè.
         it PRP.ANT happen he PAP.come
         ‘After it happened, he came.’8.3.1 Intransitive uIntransitive u ‘happen’ is limited to subordinate clauses and information questions.
It occurs in subordinate ke clauses.(115) ò kéè         ú         wèé,      ólí ókpósó ó'     vbì ìwè.
      it PRP.ANT happen short.time the woman PAP.enter LOC house
      ‘After a bit of time, the woman entered the house.’In information questions, intransitive u is preceded by interrogative pronoun émé'.
The Factative suffix -ì in these constructions is disallowed.(116) émé' ó ú'          / *ú-ì?
      what it PAP.happen    happen-F
      ‘What happened?’Responses to intransitive u ‘happen’ information questions restrict predication type.
They permit change of locative state predicates (de ‘fall’) but not caused change of
state predicates, for example gbe a ‘break’ (*ólí ómòhè gbé ákhè á [the man
PRP.break pot CS] ‘The man broke a pot’) or stative ri ‘be’ (*ólí ómòhè ríì vbí ìwè [the
man PRP.be LOC house] ‘The man is in the house’).(117) émé' ó ú'?

      ‘What happened?’
      ìtásà lí ó dé'             rè.
      plate PF it PAP.fall arrive
      ‘It is a plate that fell.’8.3.2 Transitive uTransitive u ‘happen’ constructions are syntactically rigid. They require predicate
negation, the noun émì as subject position head and an animate noun as direct ob-
ject. Transitive u ‘happen’ has no corresponding affirmative.
                                                                 ‘happen’ verbs | 473(118) a. émí ósò       í   ì   ù          ólí ómòhè.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to the man
         ‘Nothing happened to the man.’
      b. *émí ósò        ú            ólí ómòhè.
          thing certain PRP.happen.to the man
          ‘Something happened to the man.’Transitive ‘happen’ constructions accept not only Perfect Negation but also Prospec-
tive Negation with kha. Otherwise, they do not inflect for prospective aspect (*émí
ósó ló ù ólí ómòhè [thing certain PRED happen.to the man] ‘Something will happen
to the man’, *émí ósò ló ù ólí ómòhè [thing certain ANTI happen.to the man] ‘Noth-
ing is about to happen to the man’).(119) émí ósò       í khà        ù      ólí ómòhè.
      thing certain SC PRONEG happen.to the man
      ‘Nothing will happen to the man.’    Transitive u ‘happen’ fails to accept any auxiliaries or preverbs, as suggested by
the unacceptability of epistemic Certaintive ma (*émí ósò máà ù ólí ómòhè [thing
certain PRP.CER happen.to the man] ‘Something surely happened to the man’) and
evaluative preverb kuku (*émí ósò kúkù ù ólí ómòhè [thing certain PRP.POEV hap-
pen.to the man] ‘Something after all happened to the man’).
    Transitive ‘happen’ constructions confine the shape of their initial noun phrase.
They require noun émì ‘thing’ modified by existential quantifier ósò. No other post-
determiner is acceptable, i.e. demonstrative, numeral or kindred. As well, transitive
‘happen’ rejects noun émì when modified by an associative phrase, attributive
phrase or relative clause.(120) émí ósò       í ì    ù         ólí ómòhè.
      thing certain SC NEG happen.to the man
      ‘Nothing happened to the man.’Morever, three additional negative properties characterize transitive u’s initial noun
phrase. This position does not accept nominative pronouns. Neither first person
singular/plural (í/má) nor third person (ó, íyàìn) is acceptable. It is therefore primar-
ily word order that identifies subject position in transitive ‘happen’ constructions.(121) *ó / íyàìn ì        ù          ólí ómòhè.
       it     they NEG happen.to the man
       ‘It / They did not happen to the man.’
474 | Be, do, happen and haveThe initial noun phrase with transitive u rejects proper names, common nouns vary-
ing in animacy (òkpòsò, áwà, ópìà) or common nouns with a pre- or postdeterminer.(122) a. *àlèkè / ólì òkpòsò í ì         ù         ólí ómòhè.
          Aleke the woman SC NEG happen.to the man
          ‘Aleke / The woman did not happen to the man.’
      b. *ólí áwà / ópìà       í ì     ù          ólí ómòhè.
          the dog cutlass SC NEG happen.to the man
          ‘The dog / cutlass did not happen to the man.’In addition, the initial nominal position with transitive u does not admit any imper-
sonal pronouns. One does not find, for instance, demonstrative óáìn or kindred élìyó
(*óáìn / élìyó í ì ù ólí ómòhè [that.one that.kind SC NEG happen.to the man] ‘That one
/ That kind of thing did not happen to the man’), numeral èvá or èvèvá (*èvá / èvèvá
í ì ù ólí ómòhè [two both SC NEG happen.to the man] ‘Two / Both did not happen to
the man’) or existential ósò or óvbèé (*ósò / óvbèé í ì ù ólí ómòhè [certain.one anoth-
er.one SC NEG happen.to the man] ‘Nothing / Nothing else happened to the man’).
      As for the nominal position following transitive u ‘happen,’ it is not as restricted
as initial position. It permits a range of NPs and requires their syntactic elaboration.
Post-u noun phrase position accepts accusative pronouns across person and num-
ber categories, and it permits human proper nouns.(123) a. émí ósò       í   ì  ù           óì / mè / vbà.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to him me you
         ‘Nothing happened to him / me / you.’
      b. émí ósò       í ì     ù           àlèkè.
         thing certain SC NEG happen.to Aleke
         ‘Nothing happened to Aleke.’As direct object, post-u position allows human (óvbèkhàn) and nonhuman animate
(áwà) nouns designated as definite, by, for example, predeterminer ólí. However, it
disallows inanimate nouns (ópìà). Bare common noun direct objects, regardless of
animacy, are unacceptable (*émí ósò í ì ù ólí ópìà / ópìà [thing certain SC NEG hap-
pen.to the cutlass cutlass] ‘Nothing happened to the / a cutlass’).(124) a. émí ósò       í ì    ù           ólí óvbèkhàn / *óvbèkhàn.

                                                                 ‘happen’ verbs | 475     Direct object position in transitive u constructions accepts some postdetermin-
ers. Allowed are demonstrative deictic nà and áìn (émí ósò í ì ù ólí áwá áìn / ólí áwá
nà [thing certain SC NEG happen.to the dog that the dog this] ‘Nothing happened to
that / this dog’) as well as contrastive nóì (émí ósò í ì ù áwá nóì [thing certain SC NEG
happen.to dog next] ‘Nothing happened to the next dog’), and quantifiers, e.g. uni-
versal collective èrèmé and existential partitive ósò (émí ósò í ì ù áwá èrèmé / áwá
ósò [thing certain SC NEG happen.to dog all dog certain] ‘Nothing happened to all
the dogs / to a certain dog’). Excluded from u direct object position are numerals,
e.g. cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá as well as kindred forms, deictic élìyó and
contrastive ódàn.
     Transitive u direct object position allows most impersonal pronouns: demon-
stratives ònà, óáìn and ónóì, universal quantifiers, collective èrèmé and distributive
òdóòdé, as well as existential quantifiers, partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé (émí
ósò í ì ù óáìn / ònóì / *èvá / *élìyó [thing certain SC NEG happen.to that.one next.one
two one.that.kind] ‘Nothing happened to that one / the next one’). Rejected in direct
object position are numerals such as cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá and kindred
forms, deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn.
     Transitive u ‘happen’ noun phrases allow for repositioning to discourse defined
positions. u subject corresponds to a li/ni focus constituent but not a topic (*émí lí ó
ú' érá íyàìn, ó ló gbò ú íyàìn [thing R it PAP.happen.to father their it PRED ADD hap-
pen.to them] ‘As for the thing that happened to their father, it will happen to them

      thing R it PAP.happen.to father their
          lí ó ló      gbò ú        íyàìn.
          PF it PRED ADD happen them
      ‘The thing that happened to their father will also happen to them.’In information questions, transitive u subject corresponds to interrogative pronoun
émé'. Habitual aspect is obligatory in the question. Responses require a verb other
than u inflected for Habitual aspect.(126) émé' ó ò ú             òjè?
      what it H happen.to Oje
      ‘What happens to Oje?’
      ó ò khònmé.
      he H become.sick
      ‘He becomes sick.’
476 | Be, do, happen and haveIn contrast, transitive u direct object corresponds to a topic constituent but not a
focus li/ni constituent (*ólí ómóhé nà lí émí ósò í ì ù [the man this PF thing certain SC
NEG happen.to] ‘It was this man that nothing happened to’). In addition, transitive
u direct objects never correspond to an interrogative pronoun, e.g. óé' in (*óé' émí
ósò í ì ù? [who thing certain SC NEG happen.to] ‘Whom did nothing happen to?’).(127) ólí ómòhè, émí ósò         í ì    ù         óì.
      the man      thing certain SC NEG happen.to him
      ‘As for the man, nothing happened to him.’8.3.3 Intransitive ruanAlong with intransitive u ‘happen,’ Emai has a verb ruan ‘happen.’ It is limited to
intransitive constructions, failing in transitives (*ébè rúán ólí ómòhè ‘A calamity
happened to the man’).(128) ébè       rúán-ì.
      calamity PRP.happen-F
      ‘A calamity happened.’Intransitive ruan occurs in émé' ‘what’ information questions. Responses require
caused change of state (gbe) or change of state (de) verb.(129) émé' ó rúán'-ì?
      what it PAP.happen-F
      ‘What happened?’

      ‘A car killed a person.’          ‘The basket fell.’     Intransitive ruan occurs in series with allative verb ye and its human direct ob-
ject, although only in information questions.(130) émé' ó rúán'        yé      ólí ómòhè / *ólí óràn?
      what it PAP.happen move.to the man       the tree
      ‘What happened to the man?’Predicate ruan ye shows information questions with émé' ‘what’ corresponding to
subject position; responses require a change of state verb (u ‘die’).

      ó ú'-ì.
      he PAP.die-F
      ‘He died.’    As a point of comparison, the verbs ruan and u are not interchangeable. ruan
appears limited to calamitous events that are permanent or irreversible, as suggest-
ed by acceptable ruan, not u, with subject noun ébè ‘calamity.’(132) a. ébè       rúán-ì.
         calamity PRP.happen-F

          calamity PRP.happen happen-F
          ‘A calamity happened.’In addition, information questions with ruan and u do not invite equivalent re-
sponses. ruan requires permanent u ‘die’ but not temporary khonme ‘become sick’ as
response. Intransitive u, conversely, requires a temporary, not a permanent event.(133) émé' ó rúán'        yé        ólí óvbèkhàn?

The verb u ‘do’ collocates with direct object nominals to express a variety of cultural
judgments. English translations vary across ‘perform/execute,’ ‘commit/be guilty’ or
478 | Be, do, happen and have‘be engaged/immersed in,’ as the samples below suggest. Each u construction will
be examined briefly for its aspect potential and discourse properties.(135) a. ólí ómòhè ú          émí lì òbè.

negative statements, imperatives or prohibitives. They are found as polar questions
(ólí ómòhè ó ó' ù ábó vbì òkè? [the man SC CON do divination LOC Oke] ‘Did the man

     Noun phrases in u ábò collocations limit correspondence to discourse defined

veys the sense ‘provide/give assistance to.’ This construction inflects only for Pre-

     The u ìkhòbó li collocation does not restrict polarity and mood. It appears as an
imperative (ù ìkhòbó lí òhí [do assistance APP Ohi] ‘Provide assistance for Ohi’),
prohibitive (é è ú ìkhòbó lí àlèkè [you PR do assistance APP Aleke] ‘Don’t provide

     Noun phrase positions in u ìkhòbó li collocations do not correspond uniformly
to discourse defined positions. Subject corresponds to topic, li/ni focus or interroga-

man PRP.do the exam] ‘The man did / executed the exam’) or only adjunct (ólí
ómóhé ú' lèsèn [the man PAP.do well] ‘The man did / performed / executed (it)

     Collocations with u ìdàmìghé inflect for Past and Present perfect but not imper-
fect Habitual or Continuous. In the Habitual, however, there exists an alternation
where manner adjunct precedes prepositional vbi phrase.(141) a. ólí ómòhè ú        ólì ìdàmìghé lèsèn.

         the man SC H do well LOC exam
         ‘The man does / performs / executes well on exams.’     u ìdàmìghé lèsèn limits polarity and mood. It appears as a negative statement
(ólí ómòhè í ì ù ólì ìdàmìghé lèsèn [the man SC NEG do the exam well] ‘The man did
not do / perform well on the exam’) or polar interrogative (ólí ómòhè ú ólì ìdàmìghé
lèsèn? [the man PRP.do the exam well] ‘Did the man perform well on the exam?’).
     Alternation constructions exhibit similar potential for negative statement (ólí
ómòhè í ì ù lésén vbí ólì ìdàmìghé [the man SC NEG do well LOC the exam] ‘The man

atives or prohibitives.
     Noun phrases in u ìdàmìghé lèsèn collocations generally correspond to dis-
course defined positions. Subject corresponds to li/ni focus or topic but not to an
interrogative pronoun (óé'). However, subject in syntactically reduced collocations
lacking adjunct lèsèn corresponds to an interrogative pronoun (óé' ó ú' ólì ìdàmìghé?

(*émé' ó ú' lèsèn? [what he PAP.do well] ‘What did he do well?’, *émé' ó ú'-ì? [what

constitutent (*ébé' ólí ómóhé í' ú ólì ìdàmìghé? [how the man PAP.MAN do the exam]
‘How did the man do on the exam?’).8.4.4 u óhà / u ódònThe verb u collocates with ódòn ‘husband’ or óhà ‘wife’ and either of the adjuncts
chéchéché or lèsèn to convey sense ‘act, behave or perform toward / treat one’s
spouse appropriately.’ These collocations are limited to Habitual aspect.

         she H do husband her well
         ‘She acts toward / performs toward / treats well her husband.’     Collocations with u óhá and u ódòn restrict polarity and mood. In the imperative
they require Ingressive ya (yà ú ódón ó lèsèn [IG do husband your well] ‘Get on with
/ Start treating your husband well’, yà ú ódón ó chéchéché [IG do husband your ap-
propriately] ‘Start acting toward your husband in an appropriate fashion’). They fail
as prohibitives.
     u óhá/ódòn collocations are acceptable as polar interrogatives (áléké ó ò ù ódón

husband?’, áléké ó ò ù ódón óí chéchéché? [Aleke SC H do husband her appropriate-
ly] ‘Does Aleke act toward her husband appropriately?’). But they fail as negatives.
     Noun phrase positions in u óhá/ódòn collocations appear in discourse defined
positions. Subject corresponds to a li/ni focus or topic constituent. It does not corre-
spond to an interrogative pronoun like óé' (*óé' ó ò ù ódón óí chéchéché? [who she H

stituent in topic or focus position (*òdón óí lí áléké ó ò ù chéchéché [husband her PF
Aleke SC H do appropriately] ‘It is her husband that Aleke treats appropriately’). As
well, adjuncts in ‘treat’ collocations fail to correspond to an interrogative pronoun
or to assume topic or focus position (*chéchéché lí áléké ó ò ù ódón óì [appropriately
PF Aleke SC H do husband her] ‘It is appropriately that Aleke treats her husband’).

sponding interrogative pronoun.(161) a. émí lì òbè lí ólí ómóhé ú'-ì.

490 | Be, do, happen and have8.4.7 u èsèn / u òbèThe verb u collocates with a direct object consisting of either evaluative noun èsèn
‘good’ or òbè ‘bad’ modified by the definite predeterminer. Collocations of this type
exhibit limited polarity and mood potential. They appear as negative statements,
never as affirmative statements. The u ólì èsèn and u ólì òbè collocations also never
appear as polar questions, imperatives or prohibitives. In addition, neither u ólì èsèn
nor u ólì òbè inflects for perfect or imperfect aspect.(163) a. ólí ómòhè í ì       ù ólì èsèn.

         the man SC NEG do the bad.one
         ‘The man did not do the bad thing.’     Noun phrase positions in u ólì èsèn and u ólì òbè constructions relate to dis-
course positions in a restricted fashion.18 Subject never corresponds to a li/ni focus
constituent (*ólí ómòhè nà li ó ì ù ólì òbè [the man this PF he NEG do the bad.one] ‘It
was this man who did not do the bad thing’), topic constituent (*ólí ómòhè nà, ó ì ù

thing’) or interrogative pronoun (*óé' ó ì ù ólì èsèn? [who he NEG do the good.one]
‘Who did not do the good thing?’). Direct object position behaves similarly. It never
corresponds to a focus constituent (*ólì èsèn li ólí ómòhè í ì ù [the good.one PF the
man SC NEG do] ‘It was the good thing that the man did not do’), topic constituent
(*ólì èsèn, ólí ómòhè í ì ù óì [the good.one the man SC NEG do it] ‘As for the good

tion to convey situations unwelcome in village life. In these constructions, u in the
Habitual has the sense ‘engage/immerse in.’ Such collocations never appear in per-
fect aspect or imperfect Continuous.(164) a. ólí ókpósó ó ò ù èó.

     d. ójé ó ò ù ìgúó.
        Oje SC H do crookedness
        ‘Oje engages in unsavory acts / in crooked dealings.’     u constructions with sense ‘engage in’ limit polarity and mood. They appear as
prohibitives (é è kè ú èmòì [you PR ANT do gossip] ‘Don't gossip anymore’, é è kè ú
òvbéé' [you PR ANT do intrigues] ‘Don't plan intrigues anymore’) but not as impera-
tives. Constructions with u ‘engage in’ occur as polar interrogatives (ólí ókpósó ó ò ù
èó? [the woman SC H do gossip] ‘Is the woman guilty of gossip?’, ójé ó ò ù èmòì? [Oje
SC H do issues] ‘Is Oje guilty of gossip?’) and negative statements (ólì òkpòsò í yà ù
èó [the woman SC PANEG do gossip] ‘The woman never gossips’, òjè í yà ù èmòì [Oje
SC PANEG do issues] ‘Oje never gossips’). Negative statements for these construc-
tions require Past Absolute Negation yà.
     Noun phrase positions in u ‘engage in’ constructions differentially restrict their
relations to discourse positions. Subject corresponds to a topic constituent but not a
li/ni focus constituent. In addition, subject corresponds to interrogative pronoun
(óé') in questions with an obligatory partitive vbi phrase (vbí úsèé ísì ìyáín). Even
more limited is direct object, which corresponds to neither interrogative pronoun,
topic constituent nor focus constituent, e.g. (*èó lí ólí ókpósó ó ò ù [gossip PF the
woman SC H do] ‘It was gossip that the woman engaged in’).(165) a. ólí ókpósó nà, ó ò ù èó.

collocation is limited to Continuous aspect, rejecting imperfect Habitual and both
forms of the perfect. The noun phrase following u in this collocation never allows
definite article ólí/élí or any postdeterminer.
492 | Be, do, happen and have(166) òjè ò ó ù àgbòn.
      Oje SC C do life
      ‘Oje is enjoying / engaging in / conducting his life with vigor.’     u àgbòn constructions restrict mood and polarity. They appear as imperatives,
although Ingressive ya is required (yà ú ágbón ísì èé [IG do life ASS your] ‘Get on
with your life / Start living your life’). They never appear as prohibitives, negative
statements or polar questions.
     Noun phrases in u àgbòn constructions restrict repositioning in discourse. Sub-
ject fails to correspond to a li/ni focus constituent, topic constituent or interrogative
pronoun such as óé' (*óé' ó ò ù àgbòn? [who he H do life] ‘Who is enjoying life?).
Likewise, àgbòn never appears in topic or focus position or corresponds to an inter-
rogative pronoun.8.4.10 u úkpèThe verb u collocates with noun úkpè ‘festival’ to express ‘celebrate or execute a
festival.’ This collocation is restricted to Past and Present perfect and Continuous
imperfect. u úkpè rejects imperfect Habitual.(167) a. áfúzé' ú'       úkpè     léé.
         Afuze PAP.do festival TEMP
         ‘Afuze executed a festival already / celebrated already.’

         ‘They have executed a festival already / celebrated already.’Direct object úkpè allows definite article ólí and postdeterminers (è ú ólí úkpè léé
[they PRP.do the festival TEMP] ‘They celebrated / did the festival already’).
    Constructions with u úkpè constrain polarity and mood. They never appear as
imperatives or negative statements. They occur as prohibitives, with obligatory
plural subject (vbá è / *é è kè ú úkpé ísì àgágán' [you PR you PR ANT do festival ASS

sense ‘act or behave in a manly/womanly fashion,’ respectively. Neither noun ac-
cepts definite article ólí/élí or any postdeterminer and retains its abstract
‘male/female’ sense.(170) a. érá    vbà ú        ómòhè.

ble negatives indicate (*ínyó vbà í ì ù òkpòsò [mother your SC NEG do womanhood]

repositioning potential. Subject does not corefer to an interrogative pronoun, topic
constituent or li/ni focus constituent (*ínyó vbà lí ó ú' òkpòsò [mother your PF she

Constructions expressing similarity and resemblance between entities are shaped by
Emai verbs u ‘seem’ and re ‘take after.’ Each accepts a following bi ‘like’ phrase: NP
u bi NP and NP ree bi NP. Behavioral similarity is required for u bi and perceptual
similarity for re bi.20(173) a. ólí ómòhè úù          bí érá       óì.

         ‘The youth resembles his father / takes after his father.’
                                                              Resemblance verbs | 4958.5.1 Behavioral u biu bi constructions with the sense ‘seem like’ express behavioral, nonphysical re-
semblance. They compare referents articulated as grammatical subject and bi com-
plement. These constructions constrain inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs, the
syntactic shape of their noun phrases, and their potential for expressing polarity
and mood.
     Constructions with u bi restrict mood and polarity expression. They are found as
negative statements (ólí ómò í ì úù bí ómòhè [the child SC NEG seem like male] ‘The
child does not seem like a male’). They never occur as polar interrogatives, impera-
tives or prohibitives.
     Predicate u in construction with bi does not tend to exhibit properties typically
associated with verbs. It limits inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs. u bi severely
restricts auxiliaries and preverbs. It rejects deontic, epistemic, and relative tense
auxiliaries. As well, it excludes all preverbs, including aspectualizers, evaluatives,
temporals, subject attributives, quantities and manner deictics. Relative to inflec-
tion, u bi permits Present perfect in an irregular fashion, since high low tone on the
verb itself is atypical. It does not inflect for Past perfect, prospective aspect or imper-
fect aspect.(174) ólí ómòhè úù          bí érá óì.
      the man PRP.seem like father his
      ‘The man seems like his father.’      Noun phrase positions framed by u bi differentially restrict NP type, animacy
and syntactic shape. Initial position, as subject, accepts nominative pronouns (e.g.
o, i). Nonetheless, it does not allow indefinite subject pronoun a.(175) a. ò / *à úù            bí émèlúgbó.
         it one PRP.seem like bush.cow
         ‘It seems like a bush cow.’
      b. ì úù          bí érá     mè.

      ‘Ohi seems like his father.’ ‘Afuze seems like Benin City.’
496 | Be, do, happen and haveSubjects of u bi accept common nouns, regardless of animacy. However, common
nouns occur only under a definiteness condition, as shown by definite article ólí.(177) a. ólí óvbèkhàn / *óvbèkhàn úù           bí émèlúgbó.

         the cup cup PRP.seem like gourd

demonstratives nà and áìn (ólí óvbékhán nà / áìn úù bí érá óì [the youth this that
PRP.seem like father his] ‘This / That youth seems like his father’) as well as nóì
(óvbékhán nóì úù bí ólí ó ò khònmé [youth next PRP.seem like one he H become.sick]
‘The next youth seems like the one who is sick’), universal quantifiers collective
èrèmé ((élí) ívbékhán èrèmé úù bí élí yán à khònmé [the youths all PRP.seem like

èvèvá úù bí élí óhánmí ó ò gbé [youths each all.two PRP.seem like ones hunger SC H
beat] ‘Each of the / Both youths seem like the ones who were overcome with hun-
ger’), existential quantifiers, partitive ésò and contrastive évbèé, (ívbékhán ésò /
évbèé úù bí élí óhánmí ó ò gbé [youths certain other PRP.seem like ones hunger SC H
beat] ‘Certain / Other youths seem like the ones who were overcome with hunger’)
and cardinal numerals, e.g. èvá ((élí) ívbèkhàn èvá úù bí élí yán à khònmé [the
youths two PRP.seem like ones they H become.sick] ‘The two youths seem like the
ones who are sick’). Disallowed are kindred deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn.
     Subjects of u bi also accept impersonal pronouns21: demonstratives such as deic-
tic óáìn (óáìn úù bí ólì ó ò khònmé [that.one PRP.seem like one he H become.sick]
‘That one seems like one who is sick’) and contrastive ónóì (ónóì úù bí óhánmí ó ò
gbé [next.one PRP.seem like one hunger SC H beat] ‘The next one seems like one
overcome with hunger / like one beat by hunger’), universal quantifiers collective
èrèmé (èrèmé úù bí élí óhánmí ó ò gbé [all PRP.seem like ones hunger SC H beat] ‘All
seem like ones overcome with hunger’) and distributive òdóòdé (òdóòdé úù bí ólí
óhánmí ó ò gbé [each PRP.seems like one hunger SC H beat] ‘Each one seems like

óvbèé, (ósò / óvbèé úù bí ólì ó ò khònmé [certain.one another.one PRP.seem like one
he H become.sick] ‘A certain one / Another one seems like ones overcome with hun-
ger’) in addition to cardinal and collective numerals such as èvá and èvèvá (èvá vbì ò
                                                           Resemblance verbs | 497/ èvèvá úù bí élí óhánmí ó ò gbé [two LOC it all.two PRP.seem like ones hunger SC H
beat] ‘Two of them / both of them seem like ones overcome with hunger’). Cardinal
forms also appear as subjects when head of a partitive vbi phrase. Disallowed in
subject position are kindred pronouns (deictic élìyó, contrastive ódàn).
    Complements of bi are more severely constrained with respect to NP type, ani-
macy and syntactic shape. They accept bare common nouns that are human
(òkpòsò), animate (émèlúgbó), or inanimate (ùbèlè).(178) a. ólí óvbékhán nà úù            bí òkpòsò.

      c. ólí úkó' úù          bí ùbèlè.
         the cup PRP.seem like gourd
         ‘The cup seems like a gourd.’bi complements allow proper nouns of person.(179) ólí ómòhè úù         bí òhí.
      the man PRP.seem like Ohi
      ‘The man seems like Ohi.’     However, bi complements resist determiners and pronouns. As bi complement,
a personal pronoun is unacceptable. bi complements also reject impersonal pro-
nouns such as demonstrative óáìn22 (*ólí éwè úù bí óáìn [the goat PRP.seem like
that.one] ‘The goat seems like that one’). As for determiners, bi complement position
excludes nouns with definite predeterminer ólí (*ólí éwè úù bí ólí émèlúgbó [the goat
PRP.seem like the bush.cow] ‘The goat seems like the bush cow’), an additional
postdeterminer such as demonstrative áìn (*ólí éwè úù bí ólí émèlúgbó áìn [the goat
PRP.seem like the bush.cow that] ‘The goat seems like that bush cow’) and kindred
élìyó (*ólí éwè úù bí émèlúgbó élìyó [the goat PRP.seem like bush.cow that.kind] ‘The
goat seems like a bush cow of that kind’).
     Noun phrase positions in u bi constructions limit relations to discourse defined
positions. Subject does not correspond to a li/ni focus constituent, topic constituent
or interrogative pronoun.(180) *ólí ómóhé nà lí ó úù                bí érá  óì.

       father his PF the man PRP.seem like
       ‘The man seems like his father.’8.5.2 Perceptual ree biConstructions framed by ree bi express physical resemblance between two entities.
They compare referents articulated as grammatical subject and bi complement. The
resulting constructions show more severe syntactic limitations than u bi.
     ree bí constructions limit inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs. They disallow any
deontic, epistemic or relative tense auxiliary. Likewise, ree bí constructions reject
preverbs, regardless of class: aspectualizer, evaluative, temporal, subject attribu-
tive, quantity and manner-demonstrative. Their subject phrase shows the tone pat-
tern of Present perfect (right edge low tone). The high low tone on the predicate is
atypical but similar to locative ri tone. With prototypic verbs, high low tone in Pre-
sent perfect is limited to auxiliaries and preverbs. ree bí constructions never appear
in the Past perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(182) a. ólí óvbèkhàn réè             bí érá      óì.

         ‘The woman is masculine.’     Constructions with ree bi severely restrict polarity and mood. They fail as nega-
tive statements, polar interrogatives, imperatives and prohibitives, as unacceptable
negatives suggest (*ólí óvbèkhàn í ì rèè bí érá óì [the youth SC NEG take.after like
father his] ‘The youth doesn’t resemble his father’).
     Noun phrase positions linked to ree bi manifest contrasting grammatical prop-
erties. Each restricts NP type, animacy and syntactic shape. The initial noun phrase
in ree bi constructions accepts nominative pronouns (e.g. o). It thus serves as
grammatical subject. However, it rejects the indefinite subject pronoun (a).(183) ò / *à réè               bí òhí.

they are definite, as indicated by definite predeterminer (ólí).(185) a. ólí óvbèkhàn / *óvbèkhàn réè               bí ólí ómòhè.

ed from subject position are kindred forms, deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn.
     ree bi subject allows all impersonal pronouns except kindred (élìyó, ódàn).23 Ac-
ceptable are demonstratives, deictic óáìn and contrastive ónóì (óáìn / ónóì réè bí

     Complements of bi are highly constrained with ree bi. Concerning NP type, bi
complements allow proper nouns of person (òhí) or place (èkó).(186) ólí ómò réè             bí òhí. /      áfúzé' réè           bí èkó.

versal quantifiers (collective èrèmé, distributive òdóòdé) and numerals (cardinal
èvá, collective èvèvá).
     Noun phrase positions framed by ree bi restrict discourse repositioning of con-
stituents. Subject fails to correspond to a li/ni focus constituent, topic constituent or
interrogative pronoun. Similarly, bi complement position never corresponds to a
focus or topic constituent, or an interrogative pronoun.(189) a. *òjè òkpá lí ó réè                  bí ólí ómòhè.

      b. *ólí ómóhé nà lí ójé réè                bí.
          the man this PF Oje PAP.take.after like
          ‘It is this man that Oje resembles.’8.6 ‘have’ verb
The verb moe ‘have’ articulates relations of possession, either alienable or inaliena-
ble. It also translates English ‘own’ and ‘belong to.’25 Canonical moe constructions
frame two noun phrase positions and associated semantic roles: subject possessor
and direct object possessum. These constructions are limited as to overall syntactic
shape, including noun phrase exponents and verbal properties.(190) a. àlèkè mòè         àmágò.
         Aleke PRP.have mango
         ‘Aleke has a mango.’
      b. àlèkè mòè         ómò.
         Aleke PRP.have child
         ‘Aleke has a child.’
      c. ì mòè        óbò.
         I PRP.have hand
         ‘I have a hand.’
502 | Be, do, happen and haveNot all possession relations are expressed by moe constructions. Possession rela-
tions found in English predications ‘have a stain’ or ‘have food,’ for instance, are not
expressed with moe.(191) a. *ólì ìtébù / *ìtébù mòè         ínwà.
          the table table PRP.have stain
          ‘The table / A table has a stain.’
      b. *ólí áwà / *áwà mòè            émàè.
          the dog dog PRP.have food
          ‘The dog has food.’     Constructions with moe restrict mood but not polarity. They appear as negative
statements (ólí ómòhè í ì mòè úkpùn [the man SC NEG have cloth] ‘The man does not
have cloth’) and polar questions (ólí ómòhè mòè ólí úkpùn? [the man PRP.have the
cloth] ‘Does the man have the cloth of a particular type?’). However, they fail as
imperatives and prohibitives.
     Noun phrase positions in canonical moe constructions differentially constrain
NP type, animacy and syntactic shape. They also accept distinct sets of nouns, pro-
nouns and modifiers. The noun phrase position preceding moe allows nominative
pronouns, regardless of person or number. It rejects indefinite subject pronoun a.(192) ò / ì / mà / *à mòè             ópìà.
      he I    we      one PRP.have cutlass
      ‘He owns / I own / We own a cutlass.’Subject position in moe constructions allows proper nouns and common nouns. moe
subject accepts proper nouns of person (òlólò) or place (áfúzé').(193) òlólò mòè        íkèké.      /     áfúzé' mòè          úkpódè.
      Ololo PRP.have bicycle             Afuze PRP.have road
      ‘Ololo has a bicycle.’              ‘Afuze has a road.’Subject position with moe accepts animate (áwà) or inanimate (ìtébù) common
nouns regardless of modification by definite predeterminer ólí.(194) a. ólí áwà / áwà mòè            ùrìàì.

article ólí, a postdeterminer or both.(195) a. ólí óvbèkhàn / *óvbèkhàn mòè          ópìà.

tives deictic nà and áìn (ólí ómóhé nà / ólí ómóhé áìn mòè ólí úkpùn [the man this the
man that PRP.have the cloth] ‘This / That man has the cloth’) as well as contrastive
nóì (ómóhé nóì mòè ólí úkpùn [man next PRP.have the cloth] ‘The next man has the

lowing an optional definite article ((élí) ímòhè èvá mòè élí íkpùn [the men two

     In addition, moe subject allows impersonal pronouns.26 Included are demon-

However, it corresponds to interrogative pronouns émé' ‘what’ and ékà ‘how much.’

"7.4.3 Matrix clause propertiesRD limits construction polarity and mood as well as matrix clause inflection and
acceptance of auxiliaries and preverbs. RD constructions constrain mood and polar-
ity. They take the form of polar questions (ólí ómóhé shén' óì, í khì ólí émà? [the man
PAP.sell it ID be the yam] ‘Did the man sell it, that is the yam?’) and negative state-
ments (ó ì gbè ófè, í khì ólí ómòhè [he NEG kill rat ID be the man] ‘He did not kill a
rat, that is the man’). Never do they appear as prohibitives or imperatives.
     RD minimally constrains matrix clause inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs. RD
matrix clauses inflect for perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.15(59) a. ó gbé'       ólí ófè, í khì ólí ómòhè.

       the man ANTI sell it ID be the yam
       ‘The man is about to sell it, that is the yam.’      RD matrix clauses do not restrict modality. They allow deontic Hortative í (ólí
ómòhè í shèn óì, í khì ólí émà [the man HOR sell it ID be the yam] ‘The man should
sell it, that is the yam’). All epistemic judgment types are found: rational Deductive
za (ólí ómòhè záà shén óì, í khì ólí émà [the man PRP.DED sell it ID be the yam] ‘The
man must have sold it, that is the yam’), Resultative za, speculative Certaintive ma,
Dubitatives bia and vba (ólí ómóhé vbá' shén óì, í khì ólí émà? [the man PAP.DUB sell

tive Concessive rere and Hypothetical kha (ólí ómóhé khà shén óì, í khì ólí émà [the
man PAP.HYP sell it ID be the yam] ‘The man would have sold it, that is the yam’).
      Matrix clauses in RD constructions permit each relative tense auxiliary. Anterior
ke and Subsequent kpe occur, with kpe serving to illustrate their behavior (ólí ómóhé
kpé' shén óì, í khì ólí émà [the man PAP.SUB sell it ID be the yam] ‘The man still sold
it, that is the yam’).
      In RD matrix clauses, preverbs are not limited. Each aspectualizer form appears,
namely phasal Repetitive che, Additive gbo, Durative se, and Punctual ghe, as well
as boundary forms Conative òó, Ingressive ya, Egressive mo and Past Absolutes ya
and mo. Class behavior is suggested by Durative se (ólí ómòhè séè shén óì, í khì ólí
émà [the man PRP.DUR sell it ID be the yam] ‘The man still sold it, that is the yam’)
and Conative òó (ólí ómòhè ó ó' shèn óì, í khì ólí émà [the man SC CON sell it ID be the
yam] ‘The man went to sell it, that is the yam’).
      RD matrix clauses allow temporal and evaluative preverbs. They show kpao ‘ini-
tially,’ bobo ‘promptly,’ and tua ‘hurriedly,’ as indicated by kpao (ólí ómóhé kpá'ò
tón óì, í khì ólí ófè [the man PAP.earlier roast it ID be the rat] ‘The man roasted it
earlier on, that is the rat’). Only kuku ‘after all’ among evaluative preverbs is pre-
cluded in RD matrix clauses, (*ò kúkù é ólí émàè léé, ì khì ólí ómóhé nà [he PRP.POEV
eat the food TEMP ID be the man this] ‘After all, he finished eating the food, that is
the man’). Remaining evaluatives, woo ‘instead’ and duu ‘for no reason,’ are ac-
ceptable (ò dúù gbé ólí ófè, í khì ólí ómóhé nà [he PRP.EVAL kill the rat ID be the man
this] ‘He killed the rat for no reason, that is this man’).
      Uniformly grammatical in RD matrix clauses are subject attributive preverbs.
Among them are dábo ‘deliberately,’ dóbo ‘mistakenly,’ dúda ‘defiantly,’ miti ‘able,’
376 | Noncanonical constructionsgbúdu ‘courageously,’ dégbe ‘carefully,’ totóbo ‘intensely’ and kakégbe ‘persevering-
ly.’ Illustrating their acceptability are forms dábo (ó dá'bò fí ólì èkpà fí à, í khì ólí
ómóhé nà [he PAP.deliberately threw the bag project CS ID be the man this] ‘He
deliberately threw the bag away, that is this man’) and dóbo (ò dóbò é ólì émàè, í khì
ólí ómóhé nà [he PRP.mistakenly eat the food ID be the man this] ‘He mistakenly ate
the food, that is this man’).
     RD allows quantity preverbs in its matrix clause. One finds both Collective gba
(é gbá' é ólí émà, í khì élí ímòhè [they PAP.COL eat the yam ID be the men] ‘They ate
the yam together, that is the men’) and Emphatic Reflexive dobo (ó dóbó' óì é ólí
émà, í khì ólí ómòhè [he PAP.REFL him eat the yam ID be the man] ‘He himself ate
the yam, that is the man’). However, dobo only appears when its subject corre-
sponds to RD position (*ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì é óì, í khì ólí émà [the man PAP.REFL him
eat it ID be the yam] ‘The man himself ate it, that is the food’).16 RD matrix clauses
also allow quantity preverbs of intensification, namely zemi (ólí ómóhé zé'mì é óì, í
khì ólí émàè [the man PAP.ABSI eat it ID be the food] ‘The man ate a lot of it, that is
the food’) and zeze (ólí ómóhé zé'zè é vbì ò, í khì ólí émàè [the man PAP.NABI eat LOC
it ID be the food] ‘The man ate a bit of it, that is the food’).
     RD matrix clauses permit the final class of preverbs. Manner-demonstratives in
RD constructions are grammatical, as shown by ìná (ólí ómóhé íná' dín óì, í khì ólí
éwè [the man PAP.PMD tie it ID be the goat] ‘The man tied it this way, that is the
goat’) and ìyó (ólí ómóhé íyó' é óì, í khì ólí émà [the man PAP.DMD eat it ID be the
yam] ‘The man ate it that way, that is the yam’).
     Additional constraints affect Right Dislocation in subordinate clauses. RD con-
structions never appear in indicative khi, conditional si, or subjunctive li comple-
ments, as khi illustrates.(60) *òjè één-í         khí ó é'           ólí émà, í khì ólì òkpòsò.
      Oje PRP.know-F IND she PAP.eat the yam ID be the woman
      ‘Oje knew that she ate the yam, that is the woman.’RD constructions appear with select subordinate clauses. RD position follows sub-

purposive li clause (*ó yé òkè lí ó mìè éhé rè fí ísè, í khì òjè [he PAP.move.to Oke SUBJ

         SUBJ he find opportunity use throw seeds
       ‘He went to Oke, that is Oje, in order to play ayo.’7.5 Information questions
Information questions are shaped by interrogative pronouns or by pronouns in con-
struction with other grammatical or lexical forms. Interrogative pronouns in most
circumstances occur in clause initial question position. Structural shape of infor-
mation questions varies along several dimensions. Some interrogative pronouns
require a matrix clause auxiliary, preverb, postverbal particle or verb in series. One
question type shows no interrogative pronoun.
     For three interrogative pronouns their sound shape varies according to phono-
logical environment. In echo questions where each occurs in situ, interrogative pro-
nouns exhibit a final vowel sequence èé with low high tone: óèé ‘who,’ émèé ‘what’
and ébèé ‘where.’ In direct and indirect questions, where they are clause initial,
phonological realization of these pronouns is controlled by an adjacent segment.
When the following segment is a vowel, the e is retained with high downstep tone
(óé', émé', ébé', respectively). When the following segment is a consonant, the [e] is
realized as [i] and retains a high downstep tone (óí', émí', ébí', respectively).
     Interrogative pronouns are fundamental to information questions. Each as-
sumes a basic or derived shape. Four reflect the semantic categories Space (‘where’),
Person (‘who’), Object (‘what’) and Quantity/Cost (‘how many/how much’).ébé' / ébí' ‘where’                       óé' / óí' ~ éé' / éí' ‘who’
émé' / émí' ‘what’                        ékà ‘how much / how many’Three interrogative pronouns formulate a question constituent with a head noun (N)
to articulate another four information question types: Possession (‘whose’), Kindred
(‘what kind’), Quantity (‘how many’) and Cost (‘how much’).","[400, 401, 402, 403]"
"11.1 Direct and indirect control of event realization
Emai verbs characterize a relation between event realization and its external con-
trol. In complex predications, direct control is conveyed by verbs nwu ‘take hold’ or
re ‘take’ as V1, while indirect control is specified by verb ze ‘allow’ as V1 in a bi-

verb nwu ‘take hold’ as V1. As V2, intransitive verbs of stative posture occur, while
activity (e.g. e ‘eat’) and change of state (e.g. gbe ‘kill’) verbs do not. Predication
sense involves English ‘make.’(2) a. àlèkè nwú       ólí ómò múzán vbì ìtébù.

shows right edge high tone, while V2 shows the left edge low tone of a subjunctive
clause. Since permissive ze constructions fail to exhibit tonal harmony across predi-
cate elements, we interpret them as biclausal with V2 signaling a truncated clause.

unacceptable.(35) a.*òjè ló      dèlò ólí éànmì híán.

Emai complex predicates characterize the manner of a directional change of locative
state. They do so relative to a closed class of intransitive and transitive directional
motion verbs as V2. Manner expression is either intransitive or transitive, as illus-
trated by the V1 forms la ‘run’ and sua ‘push.’ Regardless of transitivity, manner is
temporally simultaneous with direction. V1 and V2 events necessarily overlap such
that V1 occurs at all time points of V2 but V2 does not occur at all time points of V1.
In addition to manner (i.e. ‘push’ and ‘run’), translation equivalents engage English
directional prepositions, (i.e. into, around, through, across, among others).(60) a. ólí ómòhè súá        ókò     ó    vbí ékóà.

      the man PRP.enter LOC room push stool
      ‘The man entered the room and pushed a mortar.’Complex manner predications, illustrated with transitive V1 sua, do not restrict syn-
tactic elaboration of NP2. The latter, for instance, accepts definite article ólí.(62) ólí ómòhè súá       ólí ókò / ókó mè ó            vbí ékóà.
     the man PRP.push the mortar mortar my enter LOC room
     ‘The man pushed the mortar / my mortar into the room.’     Complex predications of manner allow a variety of verbs as V1, both transitive
(fioo) and intransitive (la, gbulu, de). As V2, verbs such as o ‘enter’ that convey path
or direction of motion in simple predicates appear in series with V1. Other direction
verbs include: dianre ‘come out,’ fan ze ‘move across, cross,’ heen ‘move up, as-
cend,’ kpoon ‘move down, descend,’ lagaa ‘move around, circle,’ se ‘move as far as,’
shoo re ‘move out of, off of, exit,’ ye ‘move toward,’ and raa re ‘move past/over.’(63) a. éfìòò fíóó       ólí ébè      ó    vbí ékéín ìwè.

Emai complex predicates cancel an implication of event fulfillment or an assump-
tion of event realization. An assumption of event occurrence is cancelled by V2 fee
ghoo. An implication of event fulfillment is cancelled by V2 ba kun. Translation
equivalents of predication sense engage English event realization verbs try, feign or
adverbial expressions canceling event fulfillment, e.g. in vain, without success, or
unsuccessfully.

Emai complex predicates confirm fulfillment of an implied intentional state, making
the intentional state explicit with V2. Source of the intentional state is V1. Intention-
ality is the apparent origin of the predication’s purposive semantic character. Ful-
fillment is verbally expressed by stative verbs of quality (e.g. fuan ‘clean’), nonsta-
tive verbs with stative implications (e.g. e ‘eat’) or predications of co-location (ku
gbe ‘position together’).(97) a. òjè hóó         ólí úkpùn fúán.

        ‘Oje has tied the goats together.’11.5.1 Confirm stative intentional stateComplex predicates confirm fulfillment of an intentional state with a verb of qualita-
tive change of state. V2 denotes an intentional state that is lexically implied but not
asserted by V1. Since V2 choice is lexically dependent on V1, V2 form varies, exhibit-
ing a variety of meanings, although all are absolutive rather than gradient or scalar
(e.g. gba ‘be big’) in character.(98) a. òjè hóó       ólí úkpùn fúán.
        Oje PRP.wash the cloth be.clean
        ‘Oje washed the cloth clean / until it had become clean.’

        the man PRP.beat the woman die
        ‘The man beat the woman to death / until she died.’That V1 implies but does not assert intentional state V2 is revealed by constructions
with contrastive conjunction (àmáà ‘and’). Simple predicate V1 (kpe) with its subject
and direct object precede conjunct àmáà, which precedes simple predicate V2 (fuan)
with its subject pronoun. This entire construction is grammatical. But under condi-
tions where the implication of material change advanced by V1 is already confirmed,
e.g. by Change of State (CS) a particle, contrastive conjunction with àmáà fails.(99) a. ólí óvbékhán kpé'        ólì òkpàn àmáà ó ì          fùàn.

       Oje PRP.do it clean
       ‘Oje did/ make it clean.’    Complex predicates of stative confirmation deconstruct strictly. V1 occurs in a

that implies a state. These predications convey a temporally sequential relation
between their subevents, with no necessary adjacency or overlap of temporal con-
tour. As with stative confirmation predications, nonstative predications reflect a
purposive semantic relation.(108) a. òjè dé        émà é.

Emai complex predicates identify the telic end state of a change of quantitative
state. Telicity is coded by semantically differentiated V2 forms se, gbe, khoon and so.
Each conveys, respectively, an end state that is sufficient, excessive, satisfactory or
maximal. The entire predication brings into perspective an incremental change of
quantitative state expressed by V1 and assigns to its end state a telic condition.

quantity. Complex se predications appear with intransitive or transitive verbs as V1.
Quantification is measured against grammatical subject for intransitive V1 (voon ‘be
full,’ mo ‘bear,’ bun ‘be many’) or direct object for transitive V1 (da ‘drink,’ e ‘eat’).
Prediction sense is ‘enough, sufficiently.’(131) a. ólì èkpà vóón            sé.

ject. Predication sense is ‘too much/too many.’(143) a. ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó gbé gbè.

inanimate subject and partitive direct object has sense ‘become dull, blunt.’ It alters
this basic sense with a human subject and a double object framed as an external
possessor with inanimate possessor (whole) preceding possessum (part) and con-
veying sense ‘make blunt.’ The assumption of repetitive use leading to a state of
dullness may be source of the quantitative result state of complex gbe predications.(148) a. ólí ópìà     gbé-ì.

         ‘Oje made the edge of the cutlass dull.’In addition, gbe manifests another sense relevant to quantitative end state. With
animate or inanimate direct object, gbe expresses forceful contact: ‘beat, hit, make
contact repeatedly.’ This use assumes an iterative, repetitive character that may also
be the source of the quantitative result state meaning in complex gbe predications.12(149) a. ólí ómòhè gbé        ólì ìbè.

well as discourse repositioning of arguments. Regarding aspect, gbe predications
inflect for Present perfect or imperfect Continuous, not Past perfect.

"L]XP [H Hn ]XP ==> L]XP [L Hn ]XP    Each of these tonal processes is realized in patterns characterizing noun
phrases and basic clauses. Concerning noun phrases, tone of the lexical head, posi-
tion of the modifier (predeterminer ~ postdeterminer), and type of modifier (cardinal
numeral ~ non-numeral) interact to govern tonal distribution. Within a noun
phrase, modifier position differentially affects head tone. Predeterminers induce no
tonal change in the head noun, irrespective of the latter's tonal character. Definite
predeterminer ólì ‘the,’ for instance, imposes no change in the tone values of its
head noun: H L émà ‘yam’ remains H L (ólí émà); L L L ùbèlè ‘gourd’ or òkpòsò
‘woman’ remains L L L (ólì ùbèlè, ólì òkpòsò); H L L ómòhè ‘man’ remains H L L (ólí
ómòhè); L L H àkàsán ‘custard’ remains L L H (ólì àkàsán); L H L ìtébù ‘table’ re-
mains L H L (ólì ìtébù) and H !H éghó' ‘money’ remains H !H (ólí éghó').

modifiers such as èvá ‘two’ induce no change in tone of a preceding head noun.émà èvá                                  ímòhè èvá

termining character of governor tone. Noun phrase complements characterized by a
12 | Orthography and grammatical overviewhigh tone sequence at their left edge are subject to HTL when preceded by a gover-
nor with an inherent final low tone whose vowel elides. The Associative adjunct ísì
or the Correlative Conjunct khì induce HTL in a following noun phrase complement
with the required tonal condition. Lexical òkpòsò and ómòhè thus manifest variable
tone. When unmodified and serving as complement of Associative ísì or Correlative

khì phrases, the initial high of postdetermined ómóhé and ókpósó will absorb the
stranded low tone arising when the final vowel of ísì and khì elides (òmóhé, òkpósó).
HTL thus requires a left edge sequence of high tones.ísì ókpósó lí óbín'                  ísì ómóhé lí óbín'

variability consistent with the governing verb's tonal character. When immediately
preceded by a verb with low tone whose vowel elides, noun phrase complements
exhibiting the required high sequence at left edge (émá élìyó and úbélé élìyó) will
absorb the stranded low tone and display HTL (èmá élìyó and ùbélé élìyó).

        ‘The youth gave yam of that kind to the dark man.’    Lexical nouns exhibit tonal variability due not only to modifying elements and
preceding governors but also to following constituent type. Noun phrases with a
right edge low tone (émà, ùbèlè, ìtébù and òkpòsò) and followed by an adverbial
adjunct (e.g. òdè ‘yesterday’) evince HTS. Assuming no tonal obstruction, high tone
spreads to noun phrase left edge.(11) a. ólí óvbékhán nwú'        émà.

ìtébù) constrains spread. A low tone sequence at the right edge manifests HTS until
a high tone is reached.

tion of HTL and HTS. Although these processes function independently, acting sole-
ly on lexical tone values, they interact in a unidirectional fashion. HTS provides the
high sequence required for HTL. Compare in this regard the tonal contrast of clause
final direct object complements (émà and ùbèlè) compared to direct objects preced-
ing an adverbial and following a low tone verb (èmá sàá, ùbélé òdè). HTS thus feeds
application of HTL. The converse never occurs; HTL never feeds HTS.(13) a. ólí óvbékhán ó ò nwù émà.

clause correlate in large measure with contrasts defined by morphosyntactic catego-
ries. For purposes of presentation, we subsume auxiliary (modality and relative
tense) and adverbial preverb constituents under verb phrase.
16 | Orthography and grammatical overview    Tone patterns affecting verbs and their phrases reflect the interaction of aspect
with other categories. We provide a brief overview of monotransitive clauses incor-
porating monosyllabic auxiliary, preverb and verb forms. Exceptions to these tonal
patterns occur due to factors such as multi-syllabic character, inherent low or high
tone, and verb transitivity.
    Monosyllabic transitive verbs show two broad tone patterns that correlate with
grammatical marking of aspect and polarity. In perfect and imperfect aspect as well
as negation, fixed tone affects the verb. Nonfixed tone characterizes the verb in
prospective aspect.
    In imperfect aspect with a lexical noun subject, transitive verb phrases show an
obligatory subject concord (SC) morpheme followed by an aspect morpheme (Con-
tinuous <C> or Habitual <H>). Under these conditions, verb tone is low.(14) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó dà        ényó élìyó.
        the man SC C drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man is drinking wine of that kind.’
     b. ólí ómóhé ó ò dà        ényó élìyó.
        the man SC H drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man drinks wine of that kind.’For simple negation, a transitive verb is preceded by subject concord and negation
(NEG) morphemes. Under this condition, verb tone is low as well.(15) ólí ómòhè í ì        dà   ényó élìyó.
     the man SC NEG drink wine that.kind
     ‘The man did not drink wine of that kind.’Verb tone in the imperfect remains unaffected by auxiliary and preverb constituents
interposed between aspect and the verb. When a preverb such as che, for instance,
follows subject concord and aspect or negation constituents and precedes the verb,
tone is high on the preverb. However, verb tone remains fixed on low.(16) a. ólí ómòhè ò ó ché dà          ényó élìyó.
        the man SC C REP drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man is drinking wine of that kind again.’
     b. ólí ómòhè í ì        ché dà     ényó élìyó.
        the man SC NEG REP drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man did not drink wine of that kind again.’
                                     Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution | 17Verbs in imperfect aspect or perfect negation with multiple auxiliaries or preverbs
behave similarly. Verb tone remains low, while multiple auxiliary or preverb (che,
gbo) constituents show an alternating high down-stepped high tone pattern.(17) ólí ómòhè í ì       ché gbó' dà       ényó élìyó.
     the man SC NEG REP ADD drink wine that.kind
     ‘The man did not again drink wine of that kind too.’     Transitive verbs show a contrasting tonal pattern with perfect aspect. With a
lexical noun subject in the perfect, no subject concord or aspect morpheme is seg-
mentally realized. Verbs exhibit high tone, downstepped high (dá'), when preceded
by the right edge high tone subject phrase of Past perfect (PAP), or basic high (dá),
when preceded by the right edge low tone subject phrase of Present perfect (PRP).(18) a. ólí ómóhé dá'         ényó élìyó.
        the man PAP.drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man drank wine of that kind.’

        the man PRP.drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man drank wine of that kind.’When perfect aspect combines with auxiliary or preverb constituents, verb tone
distinct from the imperfect occurs. Tone realization on auxiliary or preverb varies
according to perfect aspect type. In the Past perfect, an initial monosyllabic auxilia-
ry or preverb shows downstepped high tone (ré', gbó') following a right edge high
tone subject phrase. Verb tone is high.(19) a. ólí ómóhé ré'          dá     ényó élìyó.
        the man PAP.CONC drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man supposedly drank wine of that kind.’
     b. ólí ómóhé gbó'       dá     ényó élìyó.
        the man PAP.ADD drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man drank wine of that kind too.’In the Present perfect, an initial monosyllabic auxiliary or preverb shows a high low
tone (i.e. H L, gbóò, máà) following a right edge low tone subject phrase. Verb tone
remains high.(20) a. ólí ómòhè gbóò       dá     ényó élìyó.
        the man PRP.ADD drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man has drunk wine of that kind too.’
18 | Orthography and grammatical overview    b. ólí ómòhè máà       dá    ényó élìyó.
       the man PRP.CER drink wine that.kind
       ‘The man must have drunk wine of that kind.’Verb phrases with multiple monosyllabic auxiliaries or preverbs show high low
alternation between adjacent constituents. The initial constituent retains its high
downstep or high low character according to subject phrase tone as Past or Present
perfect. Verb tone remains high.(21) a. ólí ómóhé ré'         gbò dá       ényó élìyó.
        the man PAP.CONC ADD drink wine that.kind
        ‘The man supposedly drank wine of that kind too.’

         the men PRP.ADD COL drink wine that.kind
         ‘The men have drunk wine of that kind together too.’     Under prospective aspect, where there is no subject concord or high downstep,
monotransitive verbs show a nonfixed tone pattern. Prospective aspect is condi-
tioned by the inherently high tone morpheme ló at left edge of a verb phrase. ló is
preceded by either a right edge high tone subject phrase in prospective Predictive or
a right edge low tone subject phrase in prospective Anticipative. Prospective ló con-
ditions low tone in the immediately following constituent, be it verb, auxiliary or
preverb constituent. Verbs, regardless of whether preceded by prospective Predic-
tive (PRED) ló with its right edge high tone subject phrase or Anticipative ló with its
right edge low tone subject phrase, evince low tone.(22) a. ólí ómóhé ló       dà    ólí ényò.
        the man PRED drink the wine
        ‘The man will drink the wine.’
     b. ólí ómòhè ló      dà    ólí ényò.
        the man ANTI drink the wine
        ‘The man is about to drink the wine.’However, verbs nonadjacent to prospective aspect ló do not show low tone. When ló
precedes a monosyllabic auxiliary or preverb, tonal alternation occurs across the
verb phrase. Preverb che immediately following Predictive ló, for instance, shows
low tone while the following verb shows high tone.(23) ólí ómóhé ló      chè dá     vbí ólí ényò.
     the man PRED REP drink LOC the wine
     ‘The man will again drink from the wine.’
                                     Basic syntactic constraints on tone distribution | 19Multiple auxiliaries or preverbs (che gbo) following Predictive ló lead to high low
alternation in the verb phrase and a high tone verb. Thus verb tone in prospective
aspect is nonfixed relative to perfect and imperfect aspect.(24) ólí ómóhé ló      chè gbó dá       vbí ólí ényò.
     the man PRED REP ADD drink LOC the wine
     ‘The man will again drink the wine too.’     Variable tone is evident in other constructions that also fail to assert the occur-
rence of an event. In imperative constructions, transitive verbs that occur clause
initially (following a covert subject pronoun with high tone, singular ú or plural vbá)
show low tone, as do verbs that follow Conative (CON) preverb òó.(25) a. dà    ólí ényò.
        drink the wine
        ‘Drink the wine.’
     b. ólí ómòhè ó ó'       dà    ólí ényò.
        the man SC CON drink the wine
        ‘The man went to drink the wine.’However, transitive verbs that fail to occur initially in imperative constructions do
not show low tone. When a monosyllabic preverb precedes the verb in an imperative
construction, as with initial che, che receives low tone and the following verb exhib-
its high tone.(26) chè dá     vbí ólí ényò.
     REP drink LOC the wine
     ‘Drink from the wine again.’Multiple auxiliaries or preverbs (che gbo) in imperative constructions lead to low
high alternation in the verb phrase and high tone on the verb.(27) chè gbó dá        ólí ényò.
     REP ADD drink the wine
     ‘Drink the wine again too.’     Tonal alternation in the verb phrase also characterizes prohibitive constructions
marked by a second person subject pronoun (singular é or plural vbá) and prohibi-
tive morpheme è. Verbs that follow Prohibitive è (PR) exhibit high tone.
20 | Orthography and grammatical overview(28) é   è dá        ólí ényò.

2 Morphology
Word forms in Emai arise through morphological processes of inflection and deriva-
tion. Inflection expresses number. More than other parts of speech, nominal roots
inflect for number, with prefixes attaching to noun roots, nominal pronouns and
nominal modifier roots. Verb inflection and adverb inflection each involve a single
affixal form.
     Derivation impacts verbs, nouns and adverbs. Verb derivation is limited to af-
fixation. Nominal derivation manifests three major structural types: nominalization,
compounding and reduplication. Derivation lexicalizes nouns from nouns, nouns
from verbs, nouns from verb-noun collocations, adverbs from verbs, and nouns
from entire phrases. Within each of these types there are structural subtypes based
on formal or functional criteria.","[36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47]"

  As a final note, SN ki precedes matrix clauses linked to a subordinate clause so long as the matrix
clause maintains sentence initial position (kí ólí ómóhé shén' úkpùn lí ó kpè míé éghó' rè dè émà? [SN

8 Be, do, happen and have
Emai employs several copula forms to articulate grammatical functions associated
with English ‘be’ as well as various verbs to convey ‘do,’ ‘happen’ and ‘have.’ Al-
though the phonological form expressing some functions of ‘be,’ ‘do,’ and ‘happen,’
respectively, are identical, their tonal behavior and grammatical properties are dis-
tinct. The form expressing ‘have’ shows no phonological similarity to either ‘be’ or
‘do’ forms. A residual set of verb forms expressing meanings related to ‘resemble’
and ‘seem’ occupy final sections of this chapter.8.1 ‘be’ forms
Emai employs five ‘be’ forms. Two allow a speaker to re-align a referent with respect
to presumed discourse knowledge of the hearer. One form specifies referent identity
for the addressee (óò), and another equates one referent to another (khi). Remaining
‘be’ forms convey predication, assigning a referent to either a nominal class (vbi/u),
property (u) or location (ri/e).(1) a. óáìn         lí í khì àgbògbòràn.

       the youth         PRP.be LOC house
       ‘The youth is in the house.’Each ‘be’ form defines a construction with distinct grammatical behavior.1 Construc-
tion properties are assessed relative to mood and polarity, verb suffixes and inflec-
tion, in addition to auxiliary, preverb and postverbal categories. Noun phrase posi-
tions associated with ‘be’ forms are assessed with regard to NP type, animacy,
syntactic shape and repositioning in discourse.
424 | Be, do, happen and have8.1.1 Equational identity khiA relation of Equational Identity (EID) between two noun phrase referents is con-
veyed by copula khi. One noun phrase is positioned immediately following khi and
the other occurs in focus position marked by either positive focus li/ni or negative
focus ki. The subject position preceding khi requires the Identity subject pronoun i.(2) a. ólí ómóhé nà lí í khì ònwìmè.
       the man this PF ID be farmer
       ‘It is this man who is a farmer.’
    b. ólí ómóhé nà kí í khì ònwìmè.
       the man this NF ID be farmer
       ‘It isn't this man who is a farmer.’Each noun phrase position associated with khi is syntactically restricted. khi subject
requires Identity pronoun í. It rejects nominative pronouns (e.g. o) or the indefinite
subject pronoun (a).(3) ólí ómòhè lí í / *ó / *á khì ònwìmè.
    the man PF ID he one be farmer
    ‘It is the man who is a farmer.’Subject aside, noun phrase positions framed by Equational Identity khi require
number agreement. The focus position constituent and the post-khi constituent
must show equivalent number value (*élí íkpún lí ébín' lí í khì óáìn [the cloths R dark
PF ID be that.one] ‘That one is dark cloths’).(4) élí íkpún lí ébín' lí í khì éáìn.
    the cloth R dark PF ID be those.ones
    ‘Those are the dark cloths.’    The EID copula accepts few affixal, auxiliary, preverb or post-verbal forms nor-
mally associated with Emai verbs. khi constructions evince a predicate phrase with
nonfixed tone: low tone (khì) with bare predicate phrase, i.e. absence of inflectional,
auxiliary or preverb categories, but high tone (khí) when preceded by an auxiliary or
preverb, such as epistemic Certaintive ma.(5) a. èkpèn lí í khì ójé ísì éànmì.

       ‘It is the leopard who is chief of the animals./The animal chief is the leopard.’
                                                                      ‘be’ forms | 425b.   èkpèn lí í mà khí ójé ísì éànmì.
     leopard PF ID CER be chief ASS animal
     ‘It is the leopard who is certainly chief of the animals.’
     ‘The chief of the animals is certainly the leopard.’     The EID copula rejects affixes typically associated with verbs. It disallows the
Perseverative prefix Ci-, Distributive suffix -lo/lo/no and Factative suffix -i. Relative
to inflection, khi constructions do not inflect for perfect, imperfect or prospective
aspect. EID constructions also limit auxiliaries. While incompatible with deontic
Hortative í, they allow epistemic Certaintive ma (òhí lí í mà khí óbá' [Ohi PF ID CER
be Oba] ‘It is ohi who surely is the King / Oba’), Dubitatives vba (òhí lí í vbà khí óbá'?
[Ohi PF ID DUB be Oba] ‘Could Ohi really be the King / Oba?’) and bia (òhí lí í bìà khí
óbá'?[Ohi PF ID DUB be Oba] ‘Is Ohi actually the King / Oba?’) as well as Concessive
rere (òhí lí í rèrè khí óbá'? [Ohi PF ID CONC be Oba] ‘So is it Ohi who is even the King
/ Oba?’). Unacceptable are epistemic Deductive za, Resultative za and Hypothetical
kha.
     EID khi is not as selective regarding relative tense. It admits Anterior ke (èkpèn lí
í kè khí ójé ísì éànmì [leopard PF ID ANT be chief ASS animal] ‘It is the leopard who
has been chief of the animals since then / The chief of the animals since then is the
leopard’) and Subsequent kpe (èkpèn lí í kpè khí ójé ísì éànmì? [leopard PF ID SUB be
chief ASS animal] ‘Is the chief of the animals still the leopard?’).
     As for preverbs, a few event-directed preverbs are grammatical in EID construc-
tions. Participant-directed preverbs, though, are disallowed (Chapter 3, 3.2.8 for
preverb types). khi constructions admit only kuku from the evaluative class (òhí lí í
kùkù khí óbá' [Ohi PF ID POEV be Oba] ‘Ohi is afterall the King / Oba’) and kpao from
the temporal class (èkpèn lí í kpàò khí ójé ísì éànmì [leopard PF ID earlier be chief
ASS animal]‘The chief of the animals initially was the leopard’).
     Negative focus and interrogative mood establish conditions for aspectualizer
preverbs Additive gbo (òhí kí í gbò khí óbá'? [Ohi NF ID ADD be Oba] ‘Isn't it also Ohi
who is King / Oba?’) and Durative se (òhí kí í sè khí óbá'? [Ohi NF ID DUR be Oba]
‘Isn't it still Ohi who is King / Oba?’). No other aspectualizers occur with EID khi,
irrespective of mood or focus type. Of preverbs remaining, manner-demonstrative,
subject attributive and quantity, none is grammatical in a khi construction.
     The EID copula is highly restricted Relative to postverbal complement particles
and adverbs. It disallows postverbal Temporal Perspective lee and Temporal Degree
gbe (*ólí ómòhè lí í khì ònwìmè léé / gbé [the man PF ID be farmer TEMP /much] ‘It is
the man who already is a farmer / too much of a farmer’). Likewise, khi construc-
tions reject temporal deictic adverbs, e.g. èghéènà ‘just recently’ (*ólí ómòhè lí í khì
ónwímé èghéènà [the man PF ID be farmer recently] ‘It was the man who was a
farmer recently’).2
426 | Be, do, happen and have     Copula khi restricts polarity and mood. It appears as a polar question. But it re-
jects Perfect Negation (*ólí ómóhé nà lí í ì khì ònwìmè [the man this PF ID NEG be
farmer] ‘It is not this man who is a farmer’), allowing only negative focus ki. Con-
cerning mood, khi constructions never appear as imperatives or prohibitives.(6) a. ólí ómóhé nà lí í khì ònwìmè?
       the man this PF ID be farmer

    b. ólí ómóhé nà kí í khì ònwìmè.
       the man this NF ID be farmer
       ‘It isn't this man who is a farmer.’    EID khi noun phrase positions exhibit contrasting grammatical properties. They
constrain NP type (pronoun < proper noun < common noun), definiteness (definite <
indefinite) and animacy (human < animate < inanimate). Regarding NP type, li/ni
focus position takes emphatic personal pronouns; nonemphatic nominative pro-
nouns are unacceptable.(7) mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn lí í khì ònwìmè.
    I           you     he   PF ID be farmer
    ‘It is I / you / he who am / are / is a farmer.’Focus position accepts most impersonal pronouns. It even accepts numeral headed
partitive phrases (èvá vbì ò lí í khì ìgbégbè [two LOC it PF ID be velvet] ‘It is two of
them that are velvet’). However, EID focus position disallows the partitive existen-
tial quantifier pronoun ósò (*ósò lí í khì ísì èmé [one PF ID be ASS my] ‘It is a certain
one that is mine’).
     Focus position in khi constructions allows proper nouns and common nouns.
Proper nouns accept emphatic partitive òkpá ‘alone.’(8) òjè (òkpá) lí í khì óì.
    Oje alone PF ID be thief
    ‘It is Oje (alone) who is a thief.’Regardless of their human (ómòhè), animate (èkpèn) or inanimate (ìgbégbè) charac-

        velvet PF ID be all
        ‘All are velvet.’In khi’s focus position constituent, common nouns take an optional definite prede-
terminer ((ólì) èkpà lí í khì ísì òjè [the bag PF ID be ASS Oje] ‘It is a / the bag which is
Oje's’). But they reject partitive existential quantifier ósò (*ómóhé ósò lí í khì óbá' ísì
èdó [man certain PF ID be Oba ASS Edo] ‘It is a certain man who is the Oba of Be-
nin’).
    Post-khi position is more restrained with regard to NP type and definiteness but
not animacy. It allows no personal pronouns, particularly those for accusative (óì).
Equally unacceptable are nominative (ò) and emphatic (ìyòìn) pronouns.(10) *ólì ònwìmè lí í khì óì / ò / ìyòìn.
      the farmer PF ID be him he he
      ‘It is a farmer that is he.’Post-copula position limits impersonal pronouns. It admits those that are definite or
construed as definite. Demonstrative òáìn (ólí ómòhè lí í khì óáìn [the man PF ID be
that.one] ‘That is the man’) and universal quantifying èrèmé (ìgbégbè lí í khì èrèmé
[velvet PF ID be all] ‘All are velvet’) occur. Post-copula position disallows partitive
existential pronoun ósò (*ìgbégbè lí í khì ósò [velvet PF ID be certain.one] ‘Some
thing is velvet’).
    Post-khi position also rejects numeral pronouns. èvá is representative alone
(*ìgbégbè lí í khì èvá [velvet PF ID be two] ‘Two are velvet’) or as partitive vbi phrase
head (*ìgbégbè lí í khì èvá vbì ò [velvet PF ID be two LOC it] ‘Two of them are velvet’).
     khi’s post-copula position permits proper nouns, although never with emphatic
partitive òkpá.(11) ódón     mè lí í khì òlólò (*òkpá).
     husband me PF ID be Ololo alone
     ‘My husband is Ololo.’Post-khi position also allows common nouns: human (óvbékhán), animate

clause with Relator li or an associative phrase with ísì.

        ‘It is that kind of cloth which is my headwrap.’     Modification of the noun in post-copula position in khi constructions is partially
restricted. This position rejects partitive existential ósò (*àzén lí í khì ómóhé ósò
[wizard PF ID be man certain] ‘Some man is a wizard’). When a common noun (e.g.
èkpà ‘bag’) can be semantically construed as head of an overtly headless associative
phrase in focus position (ísì òjè), post-copula position requires the definite article
(ólì èkpà). Post-khi position under this condition does not accept bare common
nouns.(13) ísì òjè lí í khì ólì èkpà /*èkpà.
     ASS Oje PF ID be the bag    bag
     ‘The bag is Oje's.’     Noun phrase positions linked by khi are fixed with respect to discourse reposi-
tioning. Focus position noun phrases cannot be replaced by a topic noun phrase
(*ódón óì, í khì òlólò [husband her ID be Ololo] ‘As for her husband, he is Ololo’). As
well, an emphatic pronoun in khi’s focus position cannot co-refer to topic (*ódón óì,
ìyòìn lí í khì òlólò [husband her he PF ID be Ololo] ‘As for her husband, it is he who is
Ololo’).(14) ódón        óì lí í khì òlólò.
     husband her PF ID be Ololo
     ‘It is her husband that Ololo is.’    Similarly, post-copula position is constrained. It cannot correspond to a noun
phrase as topic constituent (*òlólò, ódón óì lí í khì óáìn [Ololo husband her PF ID be
that.one] ‘As for Ololo, it is that one her husband is’) or as a second focus position
(*òlólò lí ódón óì lí í khì óáìn [Ololo PF husband her PF ID be that.one] ‘It is Ololo
who is that one’s husband’).
     Noun phrase positions linked by khi exhibit distinct interrogative pronouns.
Post-khi position rejects interrogative pronouns, particularly an echo question pro-
noun (*ódón óì lí í khì óèé'? [husband her PF ID be who] ‘Her husband is who?’).

     ‘Woodpecker.’     ‘It is a woodpecker.’8.1.2 Specifier oThe Specifier copula (SPE) construction identifies a referent for a hearer. It exhibits
a rather rigid syntax. SPE constructions consist of Specifier copula o preceded by a
noun phrase in a focus position that is either overtly marked by negative focus ki or
covertly marked for positive focus. SPE rejects overt marking of positive focus by
li/ni. In its canonical shape, the Specifier copula shows a high low tone.(17) óì     kí óò.         / óì (*lí) óò.
     thief NF be             thief PF be
     ‘It isn't a thief.’     ‘It’s a thief.’    SPE constructions show no grammatical subject. Nominative pronouns are not
allowed either in place of initial high tone, as one might expect if the initial high
tone o were the third person nominative pronoun (*ólí ómòhè ó ò [the man he be]
430 | Be, do, happen and have‘He is a man’), or in construction with high low tone of copula óò (*ólí ómòhè í / ú óò
[the man I you be] ‘I am / you are the man’).
     SPE frames exhibit few grammatical properties typically associated with verb
constructions. óò does not inflect for aspect, at least in the usual Emai fashion. Alt-
hough the bare SPE copula shows high low tone, it disallows aspect marking as
perfect (neither Past nor Present), imperfect (neither Continuous nor Habitual) or
prospective (neither Predictive nor Anticipative).
     Constructions with óò restrict verbal affixes, auxiliaries, preverbs, postverbal
particles and temporal deictic adverbs. Relative to verbal affixes, SPE is incompati-
ble with Perseverative prefix Ci-, Distributive suffix lo/lo/no and Factative suffix -i.
     SPE copula tone is uniformly low when preceded by a modal auxiliary. And SPE
is never compatible with a subject pronoun (ó ) preceding an auxiliary.(18) íkhúnmí ékpà má ò.            /   *íkhúnmí ékpà ó má' ò.
     medicine vomit CER be               medicine vomit it CER be
     ‘It is vomit medicine.’     SPE constructions restrict auxiliaries, except for epistemic forms, and preverbs.
Relative tense ke and kpe are unacceptable as is deontic Hortative í. SPE allows
epistemic Certaintive ma, as shown above, Dubitative vba (óì vbá ò? [thief DUB be]
‘Could it really be a thief?’) and bia (íkhúnmí ékpà bíá ò? [medicine vomit DUB be]
‘Was it actually vomit medicine?’), and Concessive rere (óì rérè ó? [thief CONC be]
‘So it was even a thief?’). Of these, only Certaintive does not require a polar ques-
tion. SPE disallows Deductive za, Resultative za and Hypothetical kha.
     Specifier copula constructions limit preverbs absolutely. They reject aspectual-
izer gbo, evaluative kuku, temporal kpao and manner-demonstrative ìyó as repre-
sentatives of their category (*óì gbó / kúkù / kpáò / ìyó ò [thief ADD POEV initially
DMD be] ‘It’s also / after all / firstly / so a thief’). In addition, they reject subject
attributive and quantity preverbs
     SPE similarly constrains post-verbal complement particles and adverbials. It
disallows Temporal Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*óì óò léé / gbé [thief
be TEMP much] ‘He’s already too much a thief’). It also prohibits temporal deictic
adverbs such as éénà ‘today’ (*óì óò éènà [thief be today] ‘It’s a thief today’).
     SPE óò constructions severely limit polarity and mood. They show an interroga-
tive form with high high tone on the copula (óì óó? [thief be] ‘Is it a thief?’, óì kí óó?
[thief NF be] ‘Isn't it a thief?’). However, óò constructions do not assume an impera-
tive, prohibitive or negative statement shape.
     Specifier óò partially restricts its initial noun phrase position, i.e focus, as to NP
type, animacy and definiteness.4 For NP type, Specifier focus requires an emphatic
pronoun, irrespective of person or number. It rejects nonemphatic nominative pro-
nouns (i, u) or the indefinite subject pronoun (a).
                                                                          ‘be’ forms | 431(19) mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn óò.
     I           you     he be
     ‘It is I / you / he.’     SPE initial position allows impersonal pronouns. These include demonstrative
(óáìn, ònà, ónóì), partitive (ósò) and contrastive (óvbèé) existential quantifier, deictic
(élìyó) and contrastive (ódàn) kindred, as well as numeral pronouns, cardinal (èvá)
or collective (èvèvá), as in (óáìn / óvbèé /ósò óò [that.one another certain.one be] ‘It
is that one / another one / a certain one’). Universal quantifier pronouns differ as to
grammaticality: collective èrèmé occurs whereas distributive òdóòdé does not.(20) èrèmé / *òdóòdé       óò.
     all          each.one be
      ‘It’s all.’     SPE focus allows proper and common nouns. It permits proper nouns of person
(òhí) and place (áfúzé') but disallows proper nouns with emphatic òkpá ‘alone.’(21) òhí (*òkpá) óò.         /    áfúzé' óò.
     Ohi alone be                 Afuze be
     ‘It is Ohi.’                 ‘It is Afuze.’    Common nouns, regardless of human (ómò), animate (áwà) or inanimate (ìtébù)
nature, appear in SPE focus position and do so with an optional definite article.(22) (ólí) ómò óò.            /   (ólí) áwà óò.        /   (ólì) ìtébù óò.
      the infant be                the dog be               the table be
      ‘It’s an / the infant.’      ‘It’s a / the dog.’      ‘It’s a / the table.’     In its focus position SPE admits various postdeterminers. Besides numerals
(èvá) and kindred forms (élìyó), it allows demonstratives like áìn (ólì ìtébú áìn óò [the
table that be] ‘It’s that table’) and existential quantifiers like ósò (ómóhé ósò óò [man
certain be] ‘It is a certain man’. Relative to universal quantifiers, SPE focus accepts
collective èrèmé but not distributive òdóòdé (ívbékhán èrèmé / *òdóòdé óò [youths
all each be] ‘It’s all the youths’).
     Noun phrases in SPE constructions disallow further repositioning in discourse.
They disallow a noun phrase in topic position with a corresponding pronominal
anaphor in focus position (*ólí ómòhè, ìyòìn óò [the man he be] ‘As for the man, it is
he’). As well, SPE óò does not accept interrogative pronouns such as émé', óé', ékà
(*émé' / óé' / ékà óò? [what who how.much be] ‘What / Who / How much is it?’).
432 | Be, do, happen and have    Although SPE constructions with óò answer a wide range of information ques-
tions,5 they do not appear as information questions. Instead, an u form, found in
property copula and class membership copula constructions, shapes information
questions for which SPE constructions serve as responses. Information questions
with u accept interrogative pronouns for person (óé'), object (émé') and quantity
(éká) but not place (ébé').(23) óé' ó ú'?     /       émé' ó ú'?           /    éká           ó ú'?

     ‘It’s Oje.’           ‘It’s a cutlass.’          ‘It’s four naira.’     The entire SPE construction in complex topic-comment structures designates a
comment relative to a preceding topic constituent (e.g. ólí ómòhè). Although the SPE
construction follows a noun phrase in topic position, the topic noun phrase corre-
sponds to no pronoun marked for a grammatical relation in the SPE construction, as
is the case in simple topic constructions.(24) ólí ómòhè, òjè óò.
     the man      chief be
     ‘As for the man, he’s the traditional ruler.’SPE constructions also serve as comment for a morphosyntactically heavy topic that
is extraposed and marked by indicative complement khi. The entire topic comment
configuration shows only a polar interrogative mood.(25) àtà óó khì òjè gbé               ákhè á?
     true be IND Oje PRP.break pot CS
     ‘Is it true that Oje broke a pot?’8.1.3 Nominal class membership vbi / uThe complementary copula forms vbi and u articulate class membership (CMB).
They assign a referent to a nominal class. Canonical CMB constructions define two
noun phrase positions: the assigned nominal precedes the class nominal with the
copula interposed. The overall syntactic shape of CMB constructions is constrained,
particularly with respect to noun phrase composition and copula verbal properties.
                                                                      ‘be’ forms | 433    CMB constructions rarely exhibit a canonical simple active, affirmative frame.
Instead, they show either Perfect Negation preceding copula vbi or a class noun in a
discourse defined position such as focus (marked by li/ni) followed by the assigned
nominal and copula u.(26) a. ólí ómòhè í ì            vbì óì.

        ‘The man is not a thief.’
     b. óì      lí ólí ómóhé ú'.
        thief PF the man PAP.be
        ‘It is a thief that the man is.’Despite their class membership function, CMB constructions never frame taxonomic
statements in which one referent is ranked relative to another using a specific to
general scale, respectively.(27) *èkpèn / ólì èkpèn         vbì éàmì.
      leopard the leopard be animal
      ‘A / The leopard is an animal.’    As previously indicated, CMB constructions limit polarity and mood. Negative
polarity is the norm. Under extremely rich contextual conditions but never at the
onset of a discourse, affirmative CMB constructions occur. When they do, vbi tone is
obligatorily low.(28) ólí ómòhè vbì óì.
     the man be thief
     ‘The man is a thief.’     CMB constructions partially limit mood expression. They appear as polar ques-
tions with Perfect Negation (ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óì? [the man SC NEG be thief] ‘Isn't the
man a thief?’) and focus (óì lí ólí ómóhé ù? [thief PF the man be] ‘Is it a thief that the
man is?’). CMB does not occur as an imperative or prohibitive.
     CMB accepts few forms prototypically associated with Emai verb phrases. It lim-
its verbal affixes, inflection, auxiliaries, preverbs, post-verbal particles and tem-
poral deictic adjuncts. Although CMB prefers negation, it does not inflect for perfect,
imperfect or prospective aspect. Likewise, it rejects verbal affixes, such as Distribu-
tive lo/lo/no (*élí ímòhè í ì vbì-lò óì [the men SC NEG be-DS thief] ‘Each of the men is
not a thief’).
     Similarly, CMB frames restrict auxiliaries and preverbs. They disallow modality,
both deontic (Hortative í) and epistemic (Certaintive ma), as well as relative tense,
434 | Be, do, happen and haveAnterior ke in (*ólí ómòhè í ì í / má / ké vbì óì [the man SC NEG HOR CER ANT be
thief] ‘The man should not be/ is surely not / is not since then a thief’). Under spe-
cial usage conditions involving fixed metaphor, the vbi copula occurs with Anterior
relative tense ke (áwé ísì òí í ì ké vbì égbé ísì òí [legs ASS her SC NEG ANT be body
ASS her] ‘Her legs do not feel part of her body anymore’).
     CMB constructions allow only one preverb. They accept evaluative preverb kuku
(ólí úkpùn í ì kùkú vbì ísì òjè [the cloth SC NEG POEV be ASS Oje] ‘Afterall, the cloth is
not Oje's’). Remaining preverb classes are rejected, namely aspectualizer (Additive
gbo), subject attributive (totóbo), temporal (kpao), manner-demonstrative (ìyó) and
quantity (gba): (*élí ímòhè í ì gbó / tòtóbó / kpàó / ìyó / gbá vbì óì [the men SC NEG
ADD / intensely /initially / DMD /COL be thief] ‘The men are not also / intensely /
initially / that way / together thieves’).
     CMB also restricts postverbal temporal particles and adverbs. It rejects Tem-
poral Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óí lèé / gbè [the
man SC NEG be thief TEMP / much] ‘The man is not a thief already / too much of a
thief’). It disallows deictic adjuncts, e.g. èghéènà ‘recently’ (*ólí ómòhè í ì vbì óí
èghéènà [the man SC NEG be thief recently] ‘The man was not a thief recently’).
     Noun phrase positions in CBM constructions are restricted by NP type and defi-
niteness but not animacy or number. Assigned nominals preceding the CMB copula
allow all NP types and all definiteness values. The class nominal following vbi/u
accepts only common nouns and only referential indefinites. Across assigned nomi-
nal and class nominal positions, number agreement is obligatory (ólí ómòhè and
ònwìmè, élí ímòhè and ìnwìmè).(29) a. ólí ómòhè / *élí ímòhè í ì   vbì ònwìmè.

       the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass
       ‘The heavy one is not a cutlass.’Some common nouns appear in CMB class position only when syntactically elabo-
rated. Abstract nouns like èmòì ‘fault’ require a possessive modifier.(31) ó ì        vbì émóí mè / *èmòì.
     it NEG be fault my        fault
     ‘It is not my fault.’Class nominal position following CMB disallows proper names and personal pro-
nouns, particularly nominative (ò) or accusative (óì) pronouns.(32) *ólí óbò       í   ì     vbì òlólò / ò / óì.
      the oraclist SC NEG be Ololo he him
      ‘The oraclist is not Ololo / he / him.’     Class nominal position constrains definiteness expression. Common nouns with
definite article ólí/élí are unacceptable (ónóì í ì vbì ómò / *ólí ómò [next.one SC NEG
be child the child] ‘The next one is not a useless child’), as are attributive phrase
descriptions marked by the same modifier (*ólí ékpé' í ì vbì ólí óbín' [the hawk SC
NEG be the dark.one] ‘The hawk is not the dark one’).
     Class position with vbi/u disallows the entire range of postdeterminers. Unac-
ceptable modifiers in class position include kindred élìyó and demonstrative nóì
(*ólí òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá élìyó / nóì [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass that.kind / next]
‘The heavy one is not that kind of cutlass’), universal quantifier èrèmé and cardinal
numeral èvá (*élì òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá èrèmé / èvá [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass all
two] ‘The heavy ones are not all the / the two cutlasses’) as well as existential quan-
tifier ósò (*ólí òkhúá í ì vbì ópíá ósò [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass some] ‘The
heavy one is not some cutlass’).
     However, CMB class position takes common nouns modified by Associative ísì
phrases. It does so provided there is no definite article (ólì òkhùà í ì vbì ópíá ísì òjè
/*ólí ópíá ísì òjè [the heavy.one SC NEG be cutlass ASS Oje the cutlass ASS Oje] ‘The
heavy one is not Oje's cutlass’). It also accepts headless associative phrases (ólì
òkhùà í ì vbì ísì òjè [the heavy.one SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The heavy one is not Oje's’).
     CMB class position accepts few impersonal pronouns. It allows the numeral
pronoun úkpòkpá ‘one’ as head of a partitive vbi phrase whose complement is a
pronominally headed relative clause. A numeral pronoun greater than one (e.g. èvá)
as head of a partitive phrase is unacceptable (*élí ópíá nà í ì vbì èvá vbí élí á ló shèn-
nò [the cutlass these SC NEG be two LOC ones one PRED sell-DS] ‘These cutlasses are
436 | Be, do, happen and havenot two of the ones that will be sold’). All other impersonal pronouns are rejected:
demonstrative, universal and existential quantifier, kindred and collective numeral.(33) ólí ópíá nà í ì             vbì úkpòkpá vbí élí á ló         shèn.
     the cutlass this SC NEG be one             LOC ones one PRED sell
      ‘This cutlass is not one of the ones that will be sold.’    Assigned position preceding the CMB copula exhibits contrasting values as to
NP type and definiteness but not animacy. Regarding NP type, it accepts proper
names (òlólò) and subject position pronouns (má, yán) but not the indefinite subject
pronoun (a).(34) a. òlólò í ì        vbì óì.

     b. má / yán / *á        ì   vbì óì.
        we they one NEG be thief
        ‘We / they are not thieves.’    Assigned position in vbi/u constructions accepts common nouns regardless of
animacy. They must, however, be syntactically elaborated.7 Assigned position per-
mits human (òkpòsò), nonhuman animate (áwá) and inanimate (ópìà) nouns, pro-
vided each is elaborated by, for example, definite article ólì.(35) a. ólì òkpòsò / *òkpòsò í ì            vbì óèjè.

        ‘The cutlass is not Oje's.’Abstract common nouns in CMB assigned position are not limited in the same way.
The noun úkhùè ‘curse’ in assigned position disallows the definite predeterminer
and any other modifier.(36) úkhùè / *ólí úkhùè / *úkhùè lí òdè        í ì    vbì émí lì èsèn.

predeterminer. Common nouns occur in assigned position when modified only by a
collective numeral, e.g. èvèvá in (ímóhé èvèvá í ì vbì ìnwìmè [men both SC NEG be
farmers] ‘Both men are not farmers’). Assigned position common nouns do not re-
quire the definite article when modified by Associative ísì (ólí áwà / áwá ísì òjè í ì vbì
áànmì [the dog dog ASS Oje SC NEG be female] ‘The dog of Oje / Oje’s dog is not
female’) or Relator li relative clause (ólí ópíá / ópíá lí ólí ómóhé nwú' fì á í ì vbì ísì òjè
[the cutlass cutlass R the man take propel CS SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The / A cutlass
that the man threw away was not Oje's’).
      Other modifiers that affect referent construal appear in assigned position. These
include postdeterminer demonstratives nà and nóì (ólí ópíá nà / ópíá nóì í ì vbì ólí á
ré' gbé ólí éwè [the cutlass this cutlass next SC NEG be one one use kill the goat]
‘This cutlass / The next cutlass is not the one used to kill the goat’).
      More constrained in assigned position are cardinal numerals and quantifier
postdeterminers. Cardinal numerals require the definite predeterminer (élí ópìà èvá
/ *ópìà èvá í ì vbì ísì òjè [the cutlass two cutlass two SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘The two
cutlasses are not Oje's’) or a complement consisting of a partitive vbi phrase (ópìà
èvá vbì ò í ì vbì ísì òjè [cutlass two LOC it SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘Two cutlasses from
them were not Oje's’).
      Assigned position rejects quantifier and kindred forms. Excluded are existential
quantifiers ósò and óvbèé (*ópíá ósò / óvbèé í ì vbì ísì òjè [cutlass some other SC NEG
be ASS Oje] ‘Some / Another cutlass is not Oje’s’) and kindred élìyó (*ópíá élìyó í ì vbì
ísì òjè [cutlass that.kind SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘A cutlass of that kind is not Oje's’).
      Impersonal pronouns in assigned position are partially restricted. Acceptable
are demonstrative ònà and ónóì (ònà / ónóì í ì vbì ísì èé [this.one next.one SC NEG be
ASS your] ‘This one / the next one is not yours’) as well as plural existential ésò (ésò
í ì vbì ísì èmé [some.ones SC NEG be ASS my] ‘None are mine’).
      In assigned position, numeral pronouns reveal a mixed distribution. Collective
numeral pronouns (èvèvá) are acceptable (èvèvá í ì vbì ísì èmé [all.two SC NEG be
ASS my] ‘Both are not mine’), whereas cardinal numeral pronouns (èvá, òkpá) re-
quire a following partitive vbi phrase (èvá vbí élì ògèdè / *èvá í ì vbì ísì èmé [two LOC
the banana two SC NEG be ASS my] ‘Two of the bananas are not mine’). Morphologi-
cal reformulation is also required for òkpá ‘one,’ e.g. úkpòkpá (úkpòkpá vbí élí á ló
shèn í ì vbì ísì òjè [one LOC ones one PRED sell SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘One of those that
will be sold is not Oje’s’).
      Nonetheless, assigned position reveals the unacceptability of remaining pro-
nouns. Kindred forms fail, deictic élìyó and contrastive ódàn (*élìyó í ì vbì ísì òjè
[that.kind SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘That kind of one is not Oje’s’), as does the contrastive
existential pronoun óvbèé (*óvbèé í ì vbì ísì òjè [other.one SC NEG be ASS Oje] ‘An-
other one is not Oje’s’).
438 | Be, do, happen and have    Nominal constituents in CMB constructions partially constrain discourse reposi-
tioning. Assigned position corresponds to a constituent in li/ni focus position or in
topic position.(37) a. ólí ómòhè òkpà lí ó ì           vbì óì.
        the man alone PF he NEG be thief

(*óì, ólí ómóhé vbì / ù óì [thief the man be / be it] ‘A thief, the man is one’).(38) óì      lí ólí ómóhé ú'.
     thief PF the man PAP.be
     ‘It is a thief that the man is.’    Copula vbi/u information questions are confined to Perfect Negation. The as-
signed position corresponds to an interrogative pronoun (óé') in question position.
Moreover, only when the interrogative contains a vbi phrase with partitive signifi-
cance (vbí úsèé vbá) is the assigned position queried (*óé' ó ì vbì óì? [who he NEG be
thief] ‘Who is not a thief?’). Class position is never queried in a grammatical struc-
ture (*óé' ólí ómóhé vbì? [who the man be] ‘Who is the man?’).(39) óé' ó ì     vbì óí    vbí úsèé vbá?
     who he NEG be thief LOC midst you
     ‘Who among you is not a thief?’    Additional conditions govern the shape of CMB constructions. Relative to pre-
copula assigned position, embedded indicative complements marked by comple-
mentizer khi must be extraposed (*khì òjè gbé ákhè á í ì vbì àtà [IND chief PRP.break
pot CS SC NEG be true] ‘That a chief broke a pot is not true’). The expletive pronoun
ó thus appears in assigned position.(40) ó ì        vbì átá khì òjè gbé            ákhè á.

lead to obligatory extraposition.

     ‘Telling lies is not a good thing.’8.1.4 Property uThe copula form u assigns a nominal referent to a property. u occurs in construction
with a preceding noun phrase and a following adjective or property noun. Although
the position preceding u manifests characteristics typical of grammatical subject,
and the property term consists primarily of adjectives,8 the property construction
(PRY) attracts relatively few features prototypically associated with verb phrases.(42) ólí ómòhè ú        négénégén.
     the man PRP.be wiry
     ‘The man is wiry.’    PRY constructions constrain mood expression more than polarity. They are
found as polar questions (ólí émá ú' kéré? [the yam PRP.be small] ‘Is the yam
small?’) and negative statements (ólí émà í ì ù kéré [the yam SC NEG be small] ‘The
yam is not small’). However, they never appear as imperatives or prohibitives.
    PRY frames constrain inflection, auxiliary and preverb categories. They inflect
for Present and Past perfect, imperfect Habitual and prospective Predictive. They
never appear in imperfect Continuous or prospective Anticipative.(43) a. ólì èkpèn ú          / ólí ékpén ú'        nwènénwèné.

        the yam PRED be small
        ‘The yam will be small.’     PRY u allows some modality and relative tense categories. It accepts all epistem-
ic forms (ólí émá má' ú kéré [the yam PAP.CER be small] ‘The yam surely is small’, ólí
émá khà ú kéré [the yam PAP.HYP be small] ‘The yam would have been small’) ex-
cept rational judgment Deductive za and Resultative za. A polar interrogative con-
struction is required for Concessive rere (ólí émá ré'rè ú kéré? [the yam PAP.CONC be
small] ‘Is the yam even small?’) as well as Dubitatives bia (ólí émá bíá' ú kéré? [the
440 | Be, do, happen and haveyam PAP.DUB be small] ‘Was the yam actually small?’) and vba (ólí émá vbá' ú kéré?
[the yam PAP.DUB be small] ‘Could the yam really be small?’). PRY rejects deontic
Hortative í. As for relative tense, PRY u disallows Anterior ke but permits Subse-
quent kpe (ólí émá kpé' ú kéré [the yam PAP.SUB be small] ‘The yam is yet small
despite pending conditions’).
     In PRY constructions preverbs are extremely restricted. One finds phasal aspec-
tualizer gbo (ólí émá gbó' ú kéré [the yam PAP.ADD be small] ‘The yam is small too’),
che (ólí émà chéè ú kéré (vbí éó mè) [the yam PRP.REP be small LOC face my] ‘The
yam is again small to my eyes’), ghe (ólí émà ghéè ú kéré (vbí éó mè) [the yam
PRP.PCT be small LOC face my] ‘The yam is just small to my eyes’), and se (ólí éwé
sé' ú kéré [the goat PAP.DUR be small] ‘The goat continues to be small’). Ungram-
matical are boundary aspectualizers: Conative òó, Ingressive ya, and Egressive mo.
     PRY u accepts none of the remaining preverb classes. Rejected are all members
of the classes evaluative (kuku), temporal (kpao), manner-demonstrative (ìyó), sub-
ject attributive (dégbe) and quantity (zemi): *ólí ómóhé kú'kù / kpá'ò / íyó' / dé'gbè /
zé'mì ú négénnégén [the man PAP.POEV initially DMD steadily ABSI be wiry] ‘The
man afterall / initially / that way / steadily / is wiry’.
     In addition, PRY constructions do not allow affixal categories, postverbal tem-
poral particles or temporal adverbs typically associated with verbs. PRY rejects Per-
severative prefix (Ci), Factative (-i) and Distributive (-lo/lo/no): *élí ímóhé ú-ló'
khúíéé [the men PAP.be-DS slim] ‘Each of the men is slim.’ PRY u also rejects Tem-
poral Perspective lee and Temporal Degree gbe (*ólí ómóhé ú' négénégén léé / gbé
[the man PAP.be wiry TEMP much] ‘The man is already / far too wiry’) in addition to
deictic temporal adjuncts such as èghéènà ‘recently’ (*ólí ómò ú khúíéé èghéènà [the
child PRP.be slim recently] ‘The child was recently slim’).
     PRY u minimally constrains associated grammatical relations. The nominal po-
sition preceding u expresses the grammatical relation subject. It takes personal
pronouns in the nominative (o, yan); it rejects indefinite subject pronoun (a).(44) ó / yán / *á       ú'       nwènénwèné.
     it they one PAP.be spotted
     ‘It is / They are spotted.’    PRY subject position is not uniquely constrained as to NP type, animacy or defi-
niteness. For NP type, subject position permits proper names.(45) òhí ú'       khúíéé.
     Ohi PAP.be slim
     ‘Ohi was slim.’
                                                                    ‘be’ forms | 441Likewise, PRY subject accepts common nouns, irrespective of animacy (human ómò,
animate ófè, inanimate úkpóràn). Each, though, must be syntactically elaborated,
by the definite article for example.(46) a. ólí ómò / *ómò        ú     kpéké.

        the stick        cloth     PRP.be small
        ‘The stick is small.’Bare noun subjects are acceptable only in generic PRY constructions marked by
Habitual aspect.(47) ékpén ó ò ú nwènénwèné.
     leopard SC H be spotted
     ‘Leopards are spotted.’     Subject position in PRY constructions permits a range of postdeterminers. It ac-
cepts demonstratives such as nà and nóì (óókhó nóì / ólí óókhó nà ú nwènénwèné
[chicken next the chicken this PRP.be spotted] ‘The next chicken / this chicken is
spotted’), existential quantifiers, partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé (óókhó ósò /
óvbèé ú nwènénwèné [chicken certain another PRP.be spotted] ‘A certain / Another
chicken is spotted’), as well as universal quantifier èrèmé and numerals such as
collective èvèvá and cardinal èvá (éókhó èrèmé / èvèvá / èvá ú' nwènénwèné [chick-
ens all both two PAP.be spotted] ‘All / both / two chickens are spotted’). Only kin-
dreds (deictic élìyó, contrastive ódàn) are unacceptable.
     PRY subject position minimally restricts impersonal pronouns.9 It permits pro-
nouns for demonstrative (óáìn), universal quantifier (èrèmé), partitive and contras-
tive existential quantifier (ósò, óvbèé) in (óáìn / óvbèé / ósò / èrèmé ú' nwènénwèné
[that.one other.one some all PAP.be spotted] ‘That one is/ Another is / Some are /
All are spotted’). Numerals (collective èvèvá, cardinal èvá), too, are acceptable (èvá /
èvèvá / èvá vbí íyáín ú' nwènénwèné [two both two LOC them PAP.be spotted] ‘Two /
both / two of them are spotted’). However, PRY subject prohibits kindred pronouns
(deictic élìyó, contrastive ódàn).
     In PRY constructions , discourse repositioning of assigned and property constit-
uents is constrained asymmetrically.10 Subject position corresponds to a constituent
in focus or topic position.
442 | Be, do, happen and have(48) a. ólí émá nà òkpá lí ó ú'               kéré.

        the yam it PAP.be small
        ‘As for the yam, it is small.’The property term position following u, however, never corresponds to focus posi-
tion (*négénégén lí ólí ómóhé ú' [wiry PF the man PAP.be] ‘It is wiry that the man is’)
or topic position (*négénégén, ólí ómòhè ú [wiry the man PRP.be] ‘A wiry character is
what the man is’).
     PRY and its constituents correspond to two information question types. Subject
corresponds to a question with sortal significance framed by émé' and distal demon-
strative áìn. émé' alone is insufficient. As a response, a bare noun in a Specifier cop-
ula óò construction is required. A PRY clause as response is unacceptable. No other
interrogative pronoun (e.g. óé' ‘who’ or ékà ‘how many’) queries PRY subject.(49) émé' ó ú'         nwènénwèné áìn?

noun ébé', Manner preverb i and verb ri ‘be located.’ In response, a PRY construc-
tion with property term in situ is acceptable. A specifier copula óò answer is not.(50) ébé' ólí ómóhé í'           ríì?

framed by the complementary predicates ri and e. Each is followed by a preposition-
al phrase headed by vbi: NP ri vbi NP, NP e vbi NP. Concerning their distribution, ri
                                                                    ‘be’ forms | 443appears under realis conditions, e.g. affirmative declarative in the perfect, and e
under irrealis conditions, e.g. imperfect and prospective aspect, negation and deon-
tic modality.
     LCT with ri and e differ in polarity and mood potential. e but not ri accepts Per-
fect Negation. Neither construction displays an imperative or prohibitive shape.(51) ólì òkpòsò í ì        è / *rì    vbí ìwè.

        the woman SC NEG be LOC house
        ‘Isn't the woman in the house?’    LCT constructions with ri and e show complementary inflection, auxiliaries and
preverbs. Aspect is expressed tonally in an irregular fashion. For Past perfect, ri
shows low tone and right edge high tone subject. For Present perfect, ri shows high
low tone and right edge low tone subject. Under conditions typical for Past and
Present perfect, ri would have shown, respectively, downstepped high (rí') and a
simple high (rí) tone (*ólí ókpósó rí' / ólì òkpòsò rí vbì èkìn [the woman be / the wom-

       the woman PRED be LOC house
       ‘The woman will be in the house.’     LCT constructions selectively express deontic and epistemic modality. e accepts
deontic Hortative (ólì òkpòsò í è vbì ìwè [the woman HOR be LOC house] ‘The woman
should be in the house’) and epistemic Hypothetical kha (ólí ókpósó khà é vbì ìwè

accepts neither.
     Locative ri accepts Dubitatives vba (ólí ókpósó vbá' rì vbí ìwè? [the woman

and Certaintive ma (ólí ókpósó má' rì vbí ìwè [the woman PAP.CER be LOC house]
‘The woman surely was in the house’). Neither LCT predicate permits Concessive
rere or Resultative za.
     LCT predications restrict relative tense. ri admits Subsequent kpe (ólì òkpòsò kpé
rì / *é vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.SUB be be LOC house] ‘The woman was yet in the
house despite upcoming events’), whereas e permits neither relative tense Subse-
quent kpe nor Anterior ke.
     LCT imposes strong restrictions on preverbs. ri allows aspectualizers Durative se
(ólì òkpòsò séè rì vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.DUR be LOC house] ‘The woman contin-
ues to be in the house’) and Past Absolute mo (ólí ókpósó mó' rì vbí ìwè [the woman
PAP.PA be LOC house] ‘The woman at one time was in the house’).
     e permits Past Absolute ya but only in polar interrogatives (ólí ókpósó yà é vbí
íwé élá ódíánmì? [the woman PAP.PA be LOC house past afternoon] ‘Did the woman
used to be at home in the afternoons?’). No other aspectualizers are acceptable with
either LCT verb.
     LCT constructions reject all remaining preverb classes: evaluative (e.g. kuku),
temporal (e.g. kpao), subject attributive (e.g. dégbe), manner-demonstrative (e.g.
ìyó) and quantity (e.g. dobo óì), as shown in *ólì òkpòsò kúkù / kpáò / dégbè / íyó' /
dóbó óì rì vbí ìwè [the woman PRP.POEV initially steadily DMD REFL her be LOC
house] ‘The woman after all / initially / steadily / that way / by herself is in the
house’.
     In LCT constructions verb affixes, postverbal temporal particles and temporal
adjuncts are restricted. Relative to postverbal particles, ri with high low tone admits
Temporal Perspective lee but disallows Temporal Degree gbe (ólí óvbèkhàn ríì vbí

     Each LCT form allows temporal adjuncts consistent with its realis/irrealis char-
acter. ri with high low tone accepts ènyáà ‘just now’ (ólí óvbèkhàn ríì vbí ékín ènyáà
[the youth PRP.be LOC market just.now] ‘The youth is in the market right now’),
which otherwise occurs with Continuous and Anticipative, and e allows éènà ‘today’

will be in the market today’) and ákhò ‘tomorrow’ (ólí óvbékhán ló è vbí ékín ákhò
[the youth PRED be LOC market tomorrow] ‘The youth will be in the market tomor-
row’). Neither LCT predicate allows any other deictic adjunct, in particular òdè ‘yes-
terday’ (*ólí óvbékhán rì vbí ékín òdè [the youth PAP.be LOC market yesterday] ‘The
youth was in the market yesterday’) and èghéènà ‘recently’ (*ólí óvbèkhàn ríì vbí ékín
èghéènà [the youth PRP.be LOC market recently] ‘The youth was in the market re-
cently’).
     Neither ri nor e combines with any verb affix, e.g. Perseverative Ci-, Factative -i,
or Distributive -lo/lo/no : *élí íkpósó rì-lò / é-ló' vbì ìwè [the women PAP.be-DS be-DS
LOC house] ‘The women are in the house’.
     LCT noun phrases contrast regarding NP type, animacy and syntax. Similar
constraints affect ri and e. The initial noun phrase in LCT constructions has few
restrictions. It shows subject position properties. The noun phrase preceding ri ac-
cepts nominative pronouns, not emphatic pronouns or indefinite subject pronoun a.
It disallows deictic locative pronouns (e.g. ááìn ‘there’).(55) ì / mà / *mèmè /*à      ríì   vbí ìwè.

     Noun phrase complements of vbi in LCT ri/e constructions reveal place subcate-
gorization. When a noun does not inherently reflect a place value, syntactic elabora-
                                                                      ‘be’ forms | 447tion is required by a relational noun modifier or by an unmarked ébé' ‘where’ head-
ed relative clause.
    LCT vbi complements are limited by the category place. vbi accepts each deictic
locative pronoun. It also permits the nondeictic locative pronoun ò.(59) a. ìéèsì ríì      vbí ààn / ááìn / èàn             / éáìn       / èvbò.

     LCT nominal repositioning in discourse is asymmetrical. Complements of vbi are
more restricted than are subjects. Subjects corefer to a noun phrase in either focus
or topic position. Assuming appropriate realis/irrealis marking, ri/e subject corre-
sponds to a li/ni focus or a topic constituent.(68) a. ólì òkpòsò òkpá lí ó rì            (*ríì)   vbí ìwè.

     Synthetic compound lexemes with a verb and noun stem refer to household arti-
facts, natural world entities, social roles, locations and time conditions. Their inter-
pretation reflects the relations ‘characterized by,’ ‘results from,’ or ‘used to under-
take.’ In corresponding syntactic phrases, the noun stem corresponds to a direct
object argument of the transitive verb

stem. They exhibit structural subclasses based on noun position. Verb and noun
elements forming complex synthetic compounds correspond to verb phrase syntac-
tic constituents. Prefixes in complex synthetic compounds include i-, o- and a-.
     Complex synthetic compound lexemes of one structural type consist of two verb
roots with an intervening noun stem. The two verbs encode a complex predicate of
event end state or result, with the noun serving as predication direct object. These
lexemes encode relatively few entities, covering selected food items, games, social
roles, and abstract conditions.
     Prefix i- converts end state verbs in series and their direct objects to patient
nominals denoting human social conditions. These lexemes have the interpretation
‘social condition characterized by VERB NOUN VERB.’ígbóbórù ‘embezzlement’: gbe ru ‘to embezzle,’ óbò ‘hand’

verb root and an adverb or adverb derived from a verb. Predominantly intransitive
verbs are involved.
    Lexemes of one structural type show a prefix, an intransitive verb and an ad-
verb. They form with one prefix, i-, which converts intransitive stative verbs and
their adverbs to agent nominals denoting human social roles. Members have the
idiomatic sense ‘one characterized by VERB ADVERB.’ìfòfòséén ‘dullard’

nally headed relative clauses. There are three classes.
     One lexeme class involves a copula (COP) predicate and accompanying pre- and
post-copula nominals of identical phonological shape. Equational Identity copula

‘happen to’ preceded by the nonhuman noun émì and followed by the human noun
ómò. Resulting lexemes have the idiomatic interpretation ‘bodily condition charac-
terized by NOUN VERB NOUN.’

One type of synthetic compound serves to identify a referent with respect to its parti-
tive character. Members exhibit a prefix+verb+noun morphological shape. Verbs in
partitive function synthetic compounds are sometimes difficult to identify synchron-
ically. Today they occur as verbs with limited distribution or even as adverb or ad-
jective forms that we assume derived historically from verbs.7 There are six synthetic
compound classes that bear on nominal classification.
     One synthetic compound class is formed with prefix ú-/í-, a post-verb noun and
an elided form of the verb kpa ‘apportion, give equal amounts, divide’ (òjè kpá émà
ó vbì ìtásà [Oje PRP.apportion yam CL LOC bowl] ‘Oje apportioned yam into the
bowls’). kpa compound sense results from apportioning a nominal referent by iso-
lating one part of its homogeneous mass or aggregate, any portion of which, when
isolated, is materially equivalent to any other portion.8 Lexemes in this class refer to
abstractions, locations (body part and otherwise), natural kinds and artifacts.","[92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103]"

tions become evident in multi-preverb phrases as well as preverb iteration or em-
phatic repetition constructions, where selected preverbs occur with emphatic effect
in narrative discourse. Preverb order reflects a scale, at one end of which are the
more event-directed classes, aspectualizer (ASP), evaluative (EVAL) and temporal
(TEMP), compared to the more participant-directed quantity (Q) class. In between
occur subject attributives (SA) and manner-demonstrative (MD).","[142, 143]"

and contrastive ódàn (*óvbékhán élìyó / ódán ú' óì [youth that.kind different.kind
PAP.do it] ‘A youth of that kind / different kind did it’).
      Subjects of monotransitive u permit most impersonal pronouns: demonstrative
óáìn, ònà, and ónóì (óáìn / ònà / ónóì ú óì [that.one this.one next.one PRP.do it] ‘That
one / This one / The next one did it’), universal quantifiers collective èrèmé and
distributive òdóòdé (èrèmé / òdóòdé ú' óì [all each.one PAP.do it] ‘All / Each one did

merals such as collective èvèvá and cardinal èvá in a bare phrase (èvèvá / èvá ú' óì
[both two PAP.do it] ‘Both / Two did it’). Cardinals also appear in a partitive phrase
(èvá vbí élí ívbékhán ú' óì [two LOC the youths PAP.do it] ‘Two of the youths did it’).
Subjects for monotransitive u do not permit kindred pronouns deictic élìyó and con-

NP type, animacy and syntactic shape. It requires a third person accusative pro-
noun, accepting singular (óì) or plural (íyàìn) forms. It never allows first or second
person accusative pronouns. Moreover, it fails to admit proper names or bare com-
mon nouns of any animacy value (*ò ú ójé / áwà / óvbèkhàn [he PRP.do Oje dog
youth] ‘He did Oje / a dog / a youth’).(95) ò ú           óì / íyàìn / *mè / *é.
     he PRP.do it them me / you
     ‘He did it / them.’Direct objects for monotransitive u also restrict syntactically elaborated common
nouns. They reject human nouns (ómò) modified by definite article ólí/élí (*ò ú ólí
ómò [he PRP.do the infant] ‘He did the infant’) or postdeterminers such as áìn or ósò
(*ò ú ólí ómò áìn [he PRP.do the infant that] ‘He did that infant’, *ò ú ómó ósò [he
PRP.do infant certain] ‘He did some infant’).
    However, u direct object accepts impersonal pronouns. It shows demonstrative
óáìn, ònà and ónóì (ò ú óáìn / ònà / ónóì [he PRP.do that.one this.one next.one] ‘He
did that one / this one / the next one’), universal quantifier èrèmé (ò ú èrèmé [he
PRP.do all] ‘He did all), existential quantifiers partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé (ò
ú ósò / óvbèé [he PRP.do certain.one another.one] ‘He did a certain one / another
one’), and numerals, e.g. cardinal èvá and collective èvèvá (ò ú èvá / èvèvá [he
PRP.do two both] ‘He did all / two / both’). Unacceptable are kindred pronouns.
    Noun phrase positions framed by monotransitive u differentially correspond to
discourse defined positions. Subjects correspond to li/ni focus or topic constituents
(àlèkè). Direct objects never correspond to these constituents.(96) a. àlèkè lí ó ú'              óì.

        Aleke she PRP.do it
        ‘As for Aleke, she did it.’Monotransitive u subject and direct object show contrasting interrogative pronouns.
Subject corresponds to question word óé' ‘who’ but never émé' ‘what.’ Direct object
corresponds to interrogative pronouns émé' and ékà but not óé'.(97) a. óé' / *émé' ó ú'    óì?

       quantity the woman PAP.do-F
       ‘How much did the woman do?’Responses to u questions about direct object require predicates taking agentive
subjects (e.g. la ‘run,’ gbe a ‘break’). Unacceptable are those taking nonagentive
subjects such as de ‘fall’ (*ìtásà lí ó dé' rè [plate PF it PAP.fall arrive] ‘It is a plate
that fell’), ri ‘be located’ (*ò ríì vbí ìwè [he PRP.be LOC house] ‘He is in the house’), or

interrogative pronoun, queries directed at u construction locative adjuncts require
verb za in series (Chapter 6, 6.2). Similarly, queries about manner adjuncts with u
require ébé' and manner preverb i/e (Chapter 6, 6.3).(99) a. ébé' ólí ókpósó zá'                ú óì?

        DMD PF she PAP.MAN do it
        ‘It was that way that she did it.’     Monotransitive u constructions are relatively unconstrained as to polarity and
mood. They appear as imperatives (ù óì [do it] ‘Do it’), prohibitives (é è ú óì [you PR
do it] ‘Don't do it’), negative statements (ólì òkpòsò í ì ù óì [the woman SC NEG do it]
                                                                      ‘do’ verbs | 463‘The woman did not do it’), and polar interrogatives (ólì òkpòsò ú óì? [the woman
PRP.do it] ‘Did the woman do it?’).
     u construction predicates manifest many properties typically associated with
verbs. Although they restrict verbal affixes, they do not limit verb inflection, auxilia-
ries, preverbs, postverbal particles and temporal adjuncts. Regarding verbal affixes,
monotransitive u rejects Perseverative prefix Ci- and Distributive suffix -lo/lo/no, as
in *élí ímòhè ú-ló óì [the men PRP.do-DS it] ‘Each of the men did it.’ Under bare verb
phrase conditions, however, u accepts Factative suffix -ì, as when direct object posi-
tion is vacated in information questions (émé' ólí ómóhé ú'-ì? [what the man PAP.do-
F] ‘What did the man do?’).
     Monotransitive u inflection reveals perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect.(100) a. ólí óvbèkhàn ú           óì. /   ólí óvbékhán ú'       óì.

         the youth       ANTI do it
         ‘The youth is about to do it.’      Monotransitive u accepts a wide range of auxiliaries. It allows deontic Hortative
í (ólí ómòhè í ù óì [the man HOR do it] ‘The man should do it’), epistemic modality
judgment types rational DED za (ólí ómòhè záà ú óì [the man PRP.DED do it] ‘The
man must have done it’) and RES za (ólí ómóhé zá' ú óì [the man PAP.RES do it] ‘As a
result the man did it’), speculative CER ma (ólí ómóhé má' ú óì [the man PAP.CER do

‘The man didn't do it, did he?’) and bia (ólí ómóhé bíá' ú óì? [the man PAP.DUB do it]
‘Did the man actually do it?’) as well as assumptive CONC rere (ólí ómóhé ré'rè ú óì17
[the man PAP.CONC do it] ‘Even the man did it’) and HYP kha (ólí ómóhé khà ú óì
[the man PAP.HYP do it] ‘The man would have done it’).
      Monotransitive u also permits relative tense, although Anterior ke requires a po-
lar interrogative (ólí ómòhè kéè ú óì? [the man PRP.ANT do it] ‘Did the man do it
464 | Be, do, happen and haveafterward / anymore?’), while Subsequent kpe does not (ólí ómóhé kpé' ú óì [the man
PAP.SUB do it] ‘The man still did it / did it despite pending conditions’).
     In monotransitive u constructions, preverbs are partially limited. Although
manner-demonstrative ìyó and ìná are disallowed, u ‘do’ accepts phasal aspectual-
izers: Repetitive che (ólí ómòhè chéè ú óì [the man PRP.REP do it] ‘The man did it
again’), Durative se (ólí ómòhè séè ú óì? [the man PRP.DUR do it ] ‘Did the man con-
tinue to do it?’), Additive gbo (ólí ómòhè gbóò ú óì [the man PRP.ADD do it] ‘The man
also did it’) and Punctual ghe (ólí ómóhé ghé' ú óì [the man PAP.PCT do it] ‘The man
just did it’).
     Monotransitive u also permits boundary aspectualizers: Conative òó (ólí ómòhè
ó ó' ù óì [he man SC CON do it] ‘The man went to do it’), Egressive mo, requiring the
Temporal Perspective particle (ólí ómòhè móò ú óì léé [he man PRP.EG do it TEMP]
‘The man almost finished doing it’), Ingressive ya (ólí ómòhè yà ú óì [the man PRP.IG
do it] ‘The man almost started to do it’) in addition to Past Absolute ya (ólí ómóhé yà
ú óì [he man PAP.PAB do it] ‘The man used to do it’) and Past Absolute mo (ólí
ómóhé mó' ú óì [he man PAP.PAB do it] ‘The man at one time did it’).
     Monotransitive u allows most evaluative preverbs with the exception of woo ‘in-
stead.’ u constructions are found with duu (ólí ómóhé dú'ú ú óì [the man PAP.EVAL
do it] ‘The man for no reason did it’) and kuku (ólí ómòhè kúkù / *wóò ú óì [the man
PRP.POEV PREV do it] ‘The man afterall did it’).
     Not limited in monotransitive u constructions are temporal preverbs: kpao (ólí
ómòhè kpáò ú óì [the man earlier PRP.do it] ‘The man initially did it’), gue (ólí ómòhè
gúé ú óì [the man PRP.unexpectedly do it] ‘The man did it quicker than expected’),
bobo (ólí ómóhé bó'bò ú óì [the man PAP.promptly do it] ‘The man promptly did it’)
and tua (ólí ómòhè túá ú óì [the man PRP.hurriedly do it] ‘The man hurriedly did it’).
     Monotransitive u restricts a few subject attributive preverbs. Ungrammatical are
dábo ‘deliberately’ and totóbo ‘intensely.’ Grammatical are dóbo (ólí ómóhé dó'bò ú
óì [the man PAP.mistakenly do it] ‘The man mistakenly did it’), miti (ólí ómóhé mí'tì
ú óì [the man PAP.able do it] ‘The man was able to do it’), dúda (ólí ómóhé dú'dà ú óì
[the man PAP.defiantly do it] ‘The man defiantly did it’), gbúdu (ólí ómóhé gbú'dù ú
óì [the man PAP.courageously do it] ‘The man courageously did it’), kakégbe (ólí
ómóhé káké'gbè ú óì [the man PAP.perseveringly do it] ‘The man endured doing it’)
and dégbe (ólí ómòhè ò ó dègbé ù óì [the man SC C carefully do it] ‘The man is steadi-
ly doing it’).
     Unrestricted in monotransitive u constructions are quantity preverbs. One finds
the forms dobo (ólí ómóhé dóbó' óì ú óì [the man PAP.REFL him do it] ‘The man did it
himself’) and gba (élí ímóhé gbá' ú óì [the men PAP.COL do it] ‘The men did it to-
gether’). Intensifier quantity forms also occur, although each requires a detransitiv-
ized predicate phrase with partitive vbi: zemi (ólí ómòhè zémì ú vbì ò [the man
PRP.ABSI do LOC it] ‘The man did a lot of it’) and zeze (ólí ómòhè zézè ú vbì ò [the
man PRP.NABI do LOC it] ‘The man did a bit of it’).

particles and deictic adverbs. They permit Temporal Perspective lee but not Tem-
poral Degree gbe (ólì òkpòsò ú óì léé / *gbé [the woman PRP.do it TEMP much] ‘The
woman did it already / finished doing it’). With appropriate inflection, monotransi-
tive u allows the full range of deictic temporal adjuncts.(101) a. ólí ókpósó ú'        óí égbíá     éènà / *éènà.

"7.6.2 Negation kiSentence negation (SN) constructions are framed by clause initial ki. They negate an
entire proposition, specifying that it is not shared by speaker and hearer as true. The
construction takes the form of a polar interrogative or a declarative with an obliga-
tory contrary-to-expectation interjection ò. Consequently, ki either queries the prop-
osition expressed in the interrogative with an assumption of doubt or contravenes
the interjection framed declarative structure.(146) a. kí ólí ókpósó één'-ì?

of auxiliaries and preverbs. Regarding preverbs, SN imposes severe restrictions. It
rejects all preverbs: aspectualizer, evaluative, temporal, subject attributive, quantity
and manner-demonstrative. SN ki constructions partially limit aspect. They inflect
for Past perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predictive prospective. Thus they disallow
Present perfect, Continuous imperfect and Anticipative prospective.(148) a. kí ólí óvbékhán fí'           ólí ókpósó úkpóràn?

ther deontic (Hortative í) nor epistemic (Certaintive ma, Dubitative vba and bia,
Deductive za, Resultative za, Concessive rere, Hypothetical kha). Hypothetical kha
illustrates (*kí ólí ómóhé khà gbé ófè? [SN the man PAP.HYP kill rat] ‘Isn’t it the case

hough not with the definite article (kí (*élí) éwé èrèmé ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goats all
PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that all the goats entered the
house’). No other quantifier (distributive universal òdóòdé, partitive existential ósò
or contrastive existential óvbèé) occupies SN subject position as modifier.
     Subject phrases in ki matrix clauses allow most numeral modifiers. One finds
collective ìgbìgbé ‘all ten’ (kí íkpún ìgbìgbé tóó' á vbí ólì èràìn ò? [SN cloths all.ten
PAP.burn CS LOC the fire INT] ‘Isn't it surely the case that all ten cloths burned up in
the fire?’) and cardinal èvá ‘two,’ although cardinals require the definite article (kí
élí éfè èvá ó' vbì òò ò? [SN the rat two PAP.enter LOC hole INT] ‘Isn't it surely the case
that two rats entered the hole?’). SN subjects disallow cardinal òkpá ‘one,’ regard-
less of constituent definiteness (*kí ómòhè òkpá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN man one PAP.enter
LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that one man entered the house’), and em-
phatic òkpá ‘alone’ (*kí ólí ómòhè òkpá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the man alone PAP.enter LOC
house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the man alone entered the house’).
     ki subjects accept postnominal modifier phrases. Among the latter are expres-
sions with Associative ísì (kí (ólí) éwé ísì ólí ókpósó ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goat ASS the
woman PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the woman's goat
entered the house’), Relator li (kí (ólí) éwé lí óbín' ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN the goat R dark
PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the dark goat entered the
house’) and relative clause (kí (ólí) ómóhé lí ó dá' ólí ényó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the man
R he PAP.drink the wine PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It isn't the case that the man who
drank the wine killed the rat, although you may have thought so’). In elicited con-
structions, there is a preference for definite article inclusion.
     Subject position in ki constructions imposes greater restrictions on impersonal
pronouns than personal pronouns. It allows subject pronouns for each person and
number.

      SN I you he PAP.kill the rat INT
      ‘It surely isn't the case that I / you / he killed the rat.’As expected, SN subjects never admit emphatic pronouns (*kí mèmè / ìyóín gbé' ólí
ófè ò [SN I he PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that I / he killed the rat’).
     SN subjects allow some impersonal pronouns. Among these are contrastive
demonstrative ónóí (kí ónóí ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN next.one PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It
surely isn't the case that the next one entered the house’) and deictic demonstrative
óáín and óná (kí óáín / óná ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN that.one this.one PAP.enter LOC house
INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that that one / this one entered the house’). Again, em-
phatic proximal ónánà is preferred (kí ónáná ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN this.very.one PAP.enter
LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that this very one entered the house’).
     As SN subject, kindred forms are constrained absolutely. Neither deictic élìyó
nor contrastive ódàn are acceptable (*kí élìyó / ódán ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN that.kind differ-
ent.kind PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that that kind / different
kind of one entered the house’).
     ki construction subjects restrict most quantifier pronouns. They do allow collec-
tive universal èrèmé (kí èrèmé ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN all PAP.enter LOC house INT] ‘It surely
isn't the case that all entered the house’). But remaining quantifiers, distributive
universal òdóòdé, partitive ósò and contrastive óvbèé, are unacceptable.
     ki subjects limit most numeral pronouns.33 Neither cardinals (e.g. èvá) nor col-
lectives (e.g. èvèvá) occur (*kí èvá / èvèvá ó' vbì ìwè ò [SN two all.two PAP.enter LOC
house INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that two of them entered the house’). úkpòkpá
‘one,’ although only as partitive phrase head, appears as SN subject (kí úkpòkpá vbí
ó húnmé'-ì ò [SN one LOC it PAP.be.good-F INT] ‘It isn't the case that one from them
is good, although you may have thought so’). But cardinal òkpá ‘one’ fails (*kí òkpá
húnmé'-ì ò [SN one PAP.be.good-F INT] ‘It isn't the case that one is good’).
     In SN subject position one also finds more complex pronoun constituents.
Among these are pronominal attributives (kí ólí óbín' gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the dark.one
PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the case that the dark one killed the rat’) and
pronominally headed relatives without Recurrent preverb a (kí ólí ó *á dé' ólí úkpún
gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN one he RC PAP.buy the cloth PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely isn't the
case that the one who bought the cloth killed the rat’).
     SN constructions greatly limit expression of polarity and mood. They appear as
polar interrogatives (kí ólí ómóhé shén' ólì émà? [SN the man PAP.sell the yam] ‘Isn't
it the case that the man sold the yam?’). However, they never occur as negative
statements, imperatives or prohibitives, as unacceptable negatives suggest (kí ólí
ómóhé í ì shèn ólì émà? [SN the man SC NEG sell the yam] ‘Isn't it the case that the
man did not sell the yam?’).
412 | Noncanonical constructions    Additional precedence constraints affect SN kí in complex sentences. SN never
precedes subjects under indicative khi, conditional si or subjunctive li.(151) a. *òjè één-í          khí kí ólí ómóhé é'               émà ò.

         SN Oje SC H want SUBJ the woman sell the yam
         ‘Isn't it the case that Oje wants the woman to sell the yam?’But in complex sentences, SN ki never precedes both a matrix clause and an embed-
ded S-complement.(153) *kí ójé míáá' òhí sí              kí áléké shén'         émà?
       SN Oje PAP.ask Ohi COND SN Aleke PAP.sell yam
       ‘Isn’t it that Oje asked Ohi if it isn't the case that Aleke sold yam.’     There are also restrictions on SN ki with other syntactically subordinate claus-
es.34 ki does not precede subjects in subordinate adverbial clauses, for example tem-
poral Anterior ke (*kí ólí ómóhé ké' é émàè léé, ó ó' shèn ólí émà? [SN the man
PAP.ANT eat food TEMP he CON sell the yam] ‘Isn't it the case that after the man
finished eating the food, he sold the yam?’), or purposive li (*òjè yé òkè lí kí ó mìè

7.7 Noncanonical construction co-occurrence
Constructions reflecting sentence affirmation, sentence negation, positive focus,
negative focus, topic, right dislocation and information question types are con-
strained in their ability to co-occur. For constructions that relate a discourse defined
position to a corresponding grammatical relation, compatibility is possible only
with distinct grammatical relations. No two constructions are compatible when
affecting the same grammatical relation.
     Sentence affirmation and sentence negation establish a baseline for assessing
construction compatibility. Of the two, sentence negation is more restricted. SA érí'
and SN ki are compatible, although érí' must precede ki (*kí érí' ólí ómóhé gbé' ófè
[SN SA the man PAP.kill rat] ‘It is not the case, indeed, that the man killed a rat’).(154) érí' kí ólí ómóhé gbé'           ófè.
      SA SN the man PAP.kill rat
      ‘Indeed, it is not the case that the man killed a rat.’Sentence affirmation is restricted with other constructions. It appears with topicali-
zation and RD but never with positive focus, negative focus or direct questions. As
shown below, SA and topicalization are compatible, provided the matrix clause
shows relative tense Anterior ke (*ólí ómòhè, érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man SA he
PAP.kill the rat] ‘As for the man, indeed he killed the rat’). Also below, SA érí' fol-
lows a topic noun phrase (*érí' ólí ómòhè, ó ké' gbé ólí ófè [SA the man he PAP.ANT
kill the rat] ‘Indeed, as for the man, he killed the rat afterward’).(155) a. ólí ómòhè, érí' ó ké'           gbé ólí ófè.
         the man       SA he PAP.ANT kill the rat
         ‘As for the man, indeed he killed the rat afterward.’
      b. òjè, érí' á à ké nwù óí gbúdú.
         Oje SA one H ANT take him squirming.fashion
         ‘As for Oje, indeed he was afterward taken squirming.’Sentence affirmation and right dislocation are compatible. érí' precedes a matrix
clause whose subject or direct object relation corresponds to the RD constituent.(156) a. érí' ó gbé'      ófè, í khì ólí ómòhè.
         SA he PAP.kill rat ID be the man
         ‘Indeed he killed a rat, that is the man.’
      b. érí' ólí ómóhé gbé'         óì, í khì ólí ófè.
         SA the man PAP.kill it ID be the rat
         ‘Indeed the man killed it, that is the rat.’
414 | Noncanonical constructionsWhen matrix verb takes both direct and indirect object, sentence affirmation and
right dislocation combine only when the direct object is right dislocated. érí' is un-
acceptable when subject or indirect object corresponds to the RD constituent.(157) a. érí' ójé shén'     óì ní    ólì òkpòsò, í khì ólí úkpùn.
         SA Oje PAP.sell it APP the woman ID be the cloth
         ‘Indeed Oje sold it to the woman, that is the cloth.’
      b. *érí ó shén'       ólí úkpùn ní ólì òkpòsò, í khì òjè.
          SA he PAP.sell the cloth APP the woman ID be Oje
          ‘Indeed, he sold the cloth to the woman, that is Oje.’
      c. *érí' ójé shén'     ólí úkpùn ní áìn, í khì ólì òkpòsò.
          SA Oje PAP.sell the cloth APP her ID be the woman
          ‘Indeed Oje sold the cloth to her, that is the woman.’      Sentence affirmation does not precede or follow positive focus li/ni (*érí' ólí ófè
lí ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [SA the rat PF the man PAP.kill-F] ‘Indeed, it was the rat that the
man killed’, *ólí ómóhé lí érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè [the man PF SA he PAP.kill the rat] ‘It was
the man, indeed, who killed the rat’), negative focus ki (*érí' ólí ómóhé kí ó gbé' ólí
ófè [SA the man NF he PAP.kill the rat] ‘Indeed, it wasn’t the rat that the man killed’,
*ólí ófè kí érí' ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì [the rat NF SA the man PAP.kill-F] ‘It wasn’t the rat
that indeed the man killed’) or information question frames (*óé' érí' ó gbé' ólí ófè?
[who SA he PAP.kill the rat] ‘Who indeed killed the rat?’, *érí' émé' ólí ómóhé gbé'-ì?
[SA what the man PAP.kill-F] ‘Indeed, what did the man kill?’).
      Sentence negation co-occurs with only two construction types, although in nei-
ther does SN ki occur clause initially. As indicated previously, sentence negation co-
occurs with sentence affirmation provided ki follows érí'. In addition, SN combines
with topicalization. It never combines with positive focus, negative focus, right
dislocation or information questions.
      Sentence negation co-occurs with topicalization as shown immediately below,
provided the topic phrase precedes ki (*kì ólí ómòhè, ó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN the man he
PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case that as for the man, he killed the rat).(158) ólí ómòhè, kí ó gbé'            ólí ófè ò.
      the man      SN he PAP.kill the rat INT
      ‘As for the man, it isn't the case that he killed the rat, you know.","[434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440]"

To the memory of Melissa Bowerman (1942–2011), whose sense of curiosity about all
things language established a supportive foundation for initiation of this project,
and to the memory of Philip Egbokhare (1927–2005), whose basic humanity and
trust fostered its completion.
PrefaceCompletion of this reference grammar would not have been possible without the
unwavering assistance of the Emai people of southern Nigeria. The manuscript is
based on cooperative investigations undertaken by the two authors at various times
since 1983. During 1981-85, the first author undertook initial fieldwork among the
Emai. It was supported by the University of Benin, Benin City, Nigeria through its
Department of Linguistics and African Languages chaired by Professor R.N.
Agheyisi. The second author was a student in that program and a native speaker of
Emai. Over the ensuing years of inquiry, his linguistic intuitions have served to filter
information obtained from other members of the Emai clan. He completed doctoral
studies in linguistics at the University of Ibadan, Nigeria and since 2002 has served
as professor of linguistics.
     Data collection leading to this grammar was sanctioned by the late Chief J.A.
Ogedegbe II, Traditional Ruler of the Emai clan. It was undertaken with assistance
from the Ministry of Education in Owan Local Government Area. Mr. G.U. Otoikhian
enlisted the cooperation of clan members, particularly storytellers and those inter-
ested in preserving the vernacular character of Emai oral tradition. Mr. Philip. O.
Egbokhare, now deceased, assisted in arranging fieldwork sites and eagerly shared
his knowledge of Emai. At various times, transportation to fieldwork sites and other
material support was provided by Ann Haring-Pedrocchi, formerly of the University
of Benin, and Renato Pedrocchi. Others too numerous to mention assisted in arrang-
ing fieldwork or assembling data.
     Formulation of this grammar benefited from collaboration made possible by the
generous assistance of several institutions. Summer research fellowships from
Southern Illinois University Edwardsville, U.S.A. assisted the first author, while
sabbatical leaves from the Department of Linguistics and African Languages at the
University of Ibadan, Nigeria, and an Alexander von Humboldt Fellowship for study
leave at the Institut für Afrikanistik und Äthiopistik at Universität Hamburg, Ger-
many, assisted the second author. Finally, linguistic material incorporated in this
grammar derives from support provided by Southern Illinois University Edwards-
ville through its Research Scholar Award, Hoppe Award and Going Professorship,
the National Science Foundation (BNS-#9011338 and SBR-#9409552) and the United
States Department of State through a College and University Affiliations Program
grant (ASJY 1333) to Southern Illinois University Edwardsville and the University of
Ibadan. We thank each of these institutions for their sustained support, without
ascribing to them any responsibility for our conclusions.
     We also wish to thank Bernard Comrie for his constructive editorial practices
and steadfastness in the preparation of this manuscript. His insightful comments

hough of course we take full responsibility for the ensuing pages.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]"

 Physical resemblance predications aside, a form related to ree appears morphologically incorpo-
rated in the verb rekhaen ‘follow, move after’ (ólì òkpòsò rèkháén / *réé ólí ómòhè [the woman
PRP.follow take.after the man] ‘The woman followed / moved after the man’). As a synchronic form,
however, ree alone never expresses the sense ‘follow.’8
 Double object complements of ye never form with human nouns as first and second object (*òjè yé
òhí àlèkè [Oje PRP.send Ohi Aleke] ‘Oje sent Ohi with Aleke’).
11 Aspect expressing complex predicates
Emai verbs in series articulate complex predicates that profile or bring into perspec-
tive some facet of an assumed or asserted change of state or possession change.
Often, though not always, the profiled element becomes evident via comparison to a
semantically related simple predicate of change, state or possession. Although types
among the latter are fewer in number relative to change of state, the function of
aspect changing complex predicates contrasts with the function of participant
changing complex predicates in Chapter 10.
     Several event types reveal a profiled character. Among them are event temporal
contour, manner, direct or indirect control of event realization, intentional end state
as cancelled or confirmed, telic status of a quantitative, positional or existence
change of state, contact end state, forcible dispossession, and resistance to assumed
change of possession.1 Across these broad classes, the verb inducing aspectual
change occurs as V1 or V2. In part, description of these event types reflects the ana-
lytic thrust of Talmy (2000) as well as Levin and Rappaport Hovav (2005).
     Aspect changing complex predicates manifest shapes that are transitive (NP1 V1
NP2 V2) or intransitive (NP1 V1 V2). All share an absolute constraint on linear order
of component verbs in series. In addition, they do not consistently deconstruct as
simple predications (e.g. transitives as NP1 V1 NP2 plus NP1 V2 NP2 or NP1/NP2 V2
and intransitives as NP1 V1 and NP1 V2). Immediately below are exemplars of predi-
cation types addressed in this chapter.","[698, 699]"

     she PAP.CONC say IND the youth        PRP.shoot LOG
     ‘Shei said that the youth shot heri.’In subject position, logophoric pronouns for third person singular (e.g. yon) contrast
with corresponding personal pronouns for third person singular (e.g o). In embed-
ded clauses, personal pronouns impose a disjoint, switch reference condition rela-
tive to their antecedent. Logophoric pronouns require conjoint reference, i.e. refer-
ential identity.(26) a. ólí ómóhé ré'            é khì ò gbé     ólí ófè.

        the man PAP.CONC say IND LOG PRP.kill the rat
        ‘The mani said that hei killed the rat.’In third person plural, personal and logophoric pronouns are identical. Hence third

13.3.3). So long as referential identity is met, logophoric pronouns occur in indica-
tive (khi), subjunctive (li) and conditional (si) complements as well as embedded VP-
complements (sà íyòìn ‘shoot her’).(28) a. ólì òkpòsò één-í         khì yòn gbé         ólí ófè.

rocal nor Reflexive pronoun occupies subject position. Reciprocal (REC) égbè ‘each

indirect object following Applicative li/ni as well as first object in a double object
complement.(30) a. élí ívbèkhàn gbé          égbè dé    mé égbè ré.

        the youths PRP.hit REC fist
        ‘The youths punched each other.’    There are two remaining bound pronouns in Emai: Emphatic Reflexive
[dobó+pronoun] and Reflexive [egbe+pronoun]. Both co-refer to a preceding noun
phrase within the same clause.(31) a. ólí ómòhè dóbó         óì híán ólí óràn.
        the man PRP.REFL him cut the wood
        ‘The man himself cut the wood.’
     b. ólí ómòhè híán      égbé óì.
        the man PRP.cut SELF him
        ‘The man cut himself.’Although each reflexive form manifests distinct distributional behavior within a
clause, the two are incompatible in the same clause.
252 | Pronouns and conjunction(32) *ólí ómòhè dóbó       óì híán égbé óì.
     the man PRP.REFL him cut SELF him
     ‘The man himself cut himself.’    The simple Reflexive égbè requires an immediately following accusative pro-
noun (égbé mè / é / óì [SELF my your him/her] ‘myself / yourself / herself’). As ante-
cedent for an égbè Reflexive, a lexically or pronominally headed noun phrase is
acceptable.(33) ólí ómòhè / ò sá             égbé óì.
     the man       he PRP.shoot SELF him
     ‘The man / He shot himself.’Reflexive égbè occupies direct object position and external possessor position,
where its personal pronoun (singular óì or plural íyàìn) must agree in person and
number with its antecedent.3(34) a. ólí ómòhè sá          égbé óì.
        the man PRP.shoot SELF him
        ‘The man shot himself.’
     b. élí ívbèkhàn sá          égbé íyàìn.
        the youths PRP.shoot SELF them
        ‘The youths shot themselves.’
     c. ólí óvbèkhàn híán       émì ó égbé óí vbí égbè.
        the youth     PRP.cut thing CL SELF him LOC body
        ‘The youth cut marks onto himself.’Reflexive égbè fails in the discourse-defined positions topic, focus or antitopic.(35) *égbé óì, òjè í ì         khà gbè ólí éwè.
      SELF him Oje SC NEG HYP kill the goat
      ‘As for himself, Oje would not have killed the goat.’     The Emphatic Reflexive, whose antecedent is a subject noun phrase, consists of
preverb dobó immediately followed by an accusative pronoun (dobó mè / é / óì
[SELF me you her him] ‘myself, yourself, herself, himself’). In contrast to égbè Re-
flexives, dobó Emphatic Reflexives are limited to positions preceding the verb. They
need not immediately precede the verb or immediately follow the subject, as shown
by a dobó phrase following Predictive aspect ló.

     the man PRED REFL him cut the wood
     ‘The man will by himself cut the wood.’Emphatic Reflexive dobó, in particular its following pronoun, must agree with the
grammatical subject in number and person.(37) a. ólí ómòhè dóbó        óì híán ólí óràn.
        the man PRP.REFL him cut the wood
        ‘The man by himself cut the wood.’
     b. élí ímòhè dóbó       íyàìn híán ólí óràn.
        the men PRP.REFL them cut the wood
        ‘The men by themselves cut the wood.’As its antecedent, emphatic reflexive dobó takes a lexically or pronominally headed
noun phrase.(38) ólí ómòhè / ò dóbó          óì sá     ólí ínì.
     the man     he PRP.REFL him shoot the elephant
     ‘The man / He himself shot the elephant.’    In focus constructions, dobó has the potential to appear in either of two posi-
tions. It can occur between the subject and verb in the matrix clause, where other
preverbs occur.(39) ólí ómòhè lí ó dóbó'        óì zé        ólì ìwè.
     the man PF he PAP.REFL him build the house
     ‘It was the man who by himself built the house.’In addition, dobó phrases can appear in focus position preceding focus particle li/ni,
thereby casting still greater contrastive emphasis on the antecedent referent.4(40) ólí ómòhè dòbó óì lí ó zé'               ólì ìwè.
     the man REFL him PF he PAP.build the house
     ‘It was the man himself who built the house.’5.5 Locative pronouns
Locative pronouns refer to a place in situational or linguistic context. They fall into
classes based on distributional patterns.5 One class is sensitive to deictic features.
The other class manifests nondeictic, anaphoric properties.
254 | Pronouns and conjunction    The locative pronoun o has a nondeictic, anaphoric function. It is limited to
noun phrase positions subcategorized for place by the locative preposition vbi. Its
antecedent can occur in a preceding sentence or within the same sentence, e.g. in
discourse focus or topic position.6(41) a. ólí ómòhè zé             ólì àsè. ò ó            vbì ò.
        the man PRP.build the hut he PRP.enter LOC it
        ‘The man built the huti. He entered iti.’
     b. ójé lí ó zé'           ólì àsè òkpá lí ó méhén-í'       vbì ò.
        Oje R he PAP.build the hut alone PF he PAP.sleep-F LOC it
        ‘It was Oje alone who built the huti who slept in iti.’
     c. ólí ékóá nà, òjè ó              vbì ò.
        the room this Oje PRP.enter LOC it
        ‘As for this roomi, Oje entered iti.’     Deictic locative pronouns utilize two principal anchor points for reference. On
one dimension, they distinguish reference point distance relative to the immediate
deictic center (where speaker and hearer are located) at three degrees: ‘right here,’
‘right there’, ‘there-yonder.’ On another dimension, they distinguish reference point
distance relative to a nonimmediate center (with speaker and hearer dislocated from
each other) at two degrees: ‘over here’ and ‘over there.’7ààn ‘right here’ (point)                èàn ‘here, over here’ (area)
ááìn ‘right there’ (point)              éáìn ‘there, over there’ (area)
èvbò ‘there yonder’Deictic locative pronouns occur in noun phrase positions subcategorized for place
by the preposition vbi or by a directional verb such as ye.8 They refer to locative
referents in the situational context.(42) a. ólí òkpòsò ó         vbì èvbò.
        the woman PRP.enter LOC there.yonder
        ‘The woman entered there.’
     b. ólí ókpósó yé'          èvbò.
        the woman PAP.move.to there.yonder
        ‘The women move to / went there.’Relative to a preceding linguistic context, deictic locatives do not exhibit anaphoric
relations.
                                                             Locative pronouns | 255(43) ólí ómòhè zé           ólì àsè.   *ò ó           vbì èvbò.
     the man PRP.build the hut          he PRP.enter LOC there.yonder
     ‘The man built the hut.’           ‘He entered there.’     Deictic locative pronouns reveal much of their semantic character relative to co-
occurring subjects in constructions with locative verb ri/e and preposition vbi
(Chapter 8, 8.1.5). As object of vbi, deictic pronoun exponents correlate differentially
with ri/e subject features such as person (first/third), number (singular/plural),
definiteness (ólì/élì ~ Ø) and noun type (animate, inanimate, nonfixed/fixed loca-
tion). Relative to conditions specified by combinations of these features, the proxi-
mal (ààn, èàn), distal (ááìn, éáìn) and maximal (èvbò) locative pronouns fall into
five subgroups:I ààn, èàn, ááìn, éáìn, èvbò
II ààn, èàn, ááìn, èvbò
III ààn, ááìn, èvbò
IV ààn, èàn
V èvbòOther subgroupings of deictic locatives never appear (*ààn, èàn, ááìn, éáìn; *èàn,
éáìn, èvbò; *ààn, éáìn; *èàn, ááìn). Overall, the distal area form éáìn reveals the most
restricted distribution.
     Group I (ààn, èàn, ááìn, éáìn, èvbò) encompasses all deictic locatives. Members
co-occur with plural count and mass noun subjects. With inflectionally plural inan-
imate count nouns referring to an aggregate as subject, each deictic locative pro-
noun is acceptable as vbi complement.(44) ídò / ígbàn    ríì     vbí ààn / èàn      / ááìn / éáìn / èvbò.
     stones/thorns PRP.be LOC here over.here there over.there yonder
     ‘Stones/thorns are here / over here / there / over there / there yonder.’Mass noun subjects show similar behavior, accepting the full range of deictic loca-
tive pronouns.(45) ìéèsì ríì       vbí ààn / èàn        / ááìn / éáìn         / èvbò.
     rice PRP.be LOC here over.here there over.there yonder
     ‘Rice is here / over here / there / over there / there yonder.’Count nouns such as ògó, which do not show an inflectional plural but refer to an
aggregate, co-occur with Group I locative pronouns.

     bottles PRP.be LOC here over.here there over.there yonder
     ‘Bottles are here / over here / there / over there / there yonder.’     Group II deictic locative pronouns (ààn, èàn, ááìn, èvbò) co-occur with count
and mass nouns. As vbi complement, Group II pronouns co-occur with subjects that
are animate/inanimate count nouns, place nouns marked for definiteness and (con-
ceptually) nonfixed place nouns. Only éáìn fails to co-occur under these conditions.
When construed as a single countable entity, ògó occurs with Group II deictic loca-
tive pronouns.(47) ògó ríì        vbí ààn / èàn          / ááìn / èvbò.
     bottle PRP.be LOC here over.here there yonder
     ‘A whole bottle is here / over here / there / there yonder.’When the definite article marks ògó it as singular (ólì) or plural (élì), it co-occurs
with Group II deictic locative pronouns.(48) ólì / élì ògò ríì        vbì ààn / èàn          /    ááìn / èvbò.
     the       bottle PRP.be LOC here over.here there               yonder
     ‘The bottle/bottles is/are here / over here / there / there yonder.’Inanimate count noun subjects, regardless of whether they occur as bare nouns or
as modified by the definite article (singular ólí or plural élí), appear with Group II
deictic locative pronouns.(49) a. údò / úgbàn ríì           vbí ààn / èàn         / ááìn / èvbò.
        stone / thorn PRP.be LOC here over.here there yonder

        the stones / thorns PRP.be LOC here over.here there yonder
        ‘The stones / thorns are here / over here / there / there yonder.’Group II forms co-occur with animate subjects marked as definite. Subjects can be
singular or plural human (ólí óvbèkhàn/élí ívbèkhàn), as well as singular or plural
animate (ólí ófè/élí éfè).

        the rats PRP.be LOC here over.here there              yonder

     the rice PRP.be LOC here over.here there              yonder
     ‘The rice is here / over here / there / there yonder.’Subjects for Group II can be nonfixed place nouns like ímè ‘farm’ and édà ‘river,’
regardless of definiteness marking. Other nouns that behave similarly are úgbìdì
‘graveyard,’ èràì ‘swamp,’ and ìdì ‘grave.’(52) a. ímè / ólí ímè ríì          vbí ààn / èàn         / ááìn / èvbò.

        ‘A river / The river is here / over here / there / there yonder.’    Group III deictic locative pronouns (ààn, ááìn, èvbò) co-occur with human and
non-human animate count noun subjects that are inflectionally singular or plural
and are unmodified.(53) a. óvbèkhàn / ívbèkhàn ríì            vbí ààn / ááìn / èvbò.

ject. They co-occur with first person singular pronoun i ‘I.’
258 | Pronouns and conjunction(54) ì ríì     vbí ààn / èàn.
     I PRP.be LOC here over.here
     ‘I am right here / over here.’    The Group V deictic locative pronoun (èvbò) appears with fixed-place nouns as
subject in contrast to nonfixed place nouns (e.g. ímè ‘farm,’ édà ‘river’). Subjects
compatible with Group V include place nouns (e.g. úgbó' ‘forest’) or village sites
(áfúzé' ‘Afuze’), both of which are assumed to be situationally fixed.(55) a. úgbó' ríì       vbí èvbò.
        forest PRP.be LOC yonder
        ‘A forest is there yonder.’
     b. áfúzé' ríì      vbí èvbò.
        Afuze PRP.be LOC yonder
        ‘Afuze is there yonder.’5.6 Impersonal pronouns
Impersonal pronouns reflect demonstrative, kindred, quantifying and numeral clas-
ses. All but demonstrative are identical in phonological shape to corresponding
nominal postdeterminer modifiers (Chapter 4, 4.3.2). Except for numerals and uni-
versal quantifiers, impersonal pronouns inflect for number with a vowel prefix. And
all except numerals show a nondeictic, contrastive member.
     Demonstrative pronouns include deictic and nondeictic, contrastive members.
Deictic demonstrative pronouns differentiate proximal/distal through their root and
express number by vowel prefix alternation: óáìn ‘that one,’ ònà ‘this one,’ éáìn
‘those ones,’ ènà ‘these ones.’ Their root forms are identical in phonological shape
to demonstrative postdeterminer modifiers, i.e. áìn, nà. Deictic demonstrative pro-
nouns reject all modifier types. A nondeictic, contrastive demonstrative pronoun
also conveys number by vowel prefix alternation: ónóì ‘next one,’ énóì ‘next ones.’
     In contrast to other impersonal pronouns, demonstrative pronouns never occur
as head of a partitive vbi phrase (*óáín/óná/ónóí vbí élí ívbèkhàn ‘that one/this
one/the next one of the youths’). Constrained by number, demonstrative pronouns
occupy noun phrase positions. They refer to participants in the situational context.(56) a. óná / óáín        wéló'       ólì òtòì.
        this.one that.one PAP.sweep the floor
        ‘This one / That one swept the floor.’
     b. ónóí      ló     wèlò ólì òtòì.
        next.one PRED sweep the floor
        ‘The next one will sweep the floor.’
                                                            Impersonal pronouns | 259Demonstrative pronouns that are plural, éná / éáín ‘these ones / those ones’ and
énóí ‘the next ones,’ do not co-refer to an antecedent in a preceding sentence.(57) a.*élí ívbèkhàn èvá ó'           vbì ìwè.
         the youths two PAP.enter LOC house
         ‘The two youths entered the house.

            these.ones those.ones PAP.sweep the floor

     b. *élí ívbèkhàn ò ó ò        vbí ìwè.

         ‘The youths are entering the house.

            next.ones PRED sweep the floor
            The next ones will sweep the floor.’Deictic demonstrative pronouns interact with deictic elements elsewhere in a
clause. They are incompatible with locative reference points specified as clauses
within which a deictic pronoun (e.g. í ‘I’) occurs. The contrastive demonstrative
pronoun is not restricted in this same fashion.(58) a. *ònà / óáìn         ríì     vbí ébé' í ríì.
         this.one that.one PRP.be LOC where I PAP.be
        ‘This / That one is where I am.’
     b. ónóì       ríì     vbí ébé' í ríì.
         next.one PRP.be LOC where I PAP.be
         ‘The next one is where I am. / The one at hand is where I am.’     Kindred pronouns exhibit deictic as well as nondeictic, contrastive forms. For
deictic kindred, proximal/distal is conveyed by two root morphemes and singu-
lar/plural by vowel prefix alternation. Among older Emai speakers, four deictic
kindred forms reflecting proximal/distal and singular/plural are available: ónìná
‘this kind of one,’ énìná ‘these kind of ones,’ ólìyó ‘that kind of one,’ élìyó ‘those kind
of ones.’ Younger speakers utilize only the erstwhile plural forms élìyó and énìná for
deictic kindred pronoun relations. Irrespective of age group, there is a nondeictic,
contrastive kindred pronoun. It inflects for number through vowel prefix alterna-
tion: ódàn ‘one of different kind,’ édàn ‘ones of different kind.’
     The contrastive kindred singular form partially reduplicates and exhibits dis-
tributive reference (ódòódàn ‘ones of a different kind’). There is no comparable plu-
ral form (*édèédàn ‘ones of different kind’). Contrastive kindred ódán occurs in a
partitive phrase as head relative to an immediately following vbi preposition and its
260 | Pronouns and conjunctioncomplement. The complement can be headed by a relational noun such as úsèé
‘crowd’ followed by Associative ísì and a plural nominal. However, plural vbi phrase
complements that lack a relational noun like úsèé are unacceptable (*ódán vbí élí
íkpùn ‘different kind of one from the cloths’).ódán            vbí úsèé ísì ìyáín

tence.(60) a. *élí ópìà ríì        vbí ìtébù. ò nwú           élìyó    ó vbì ò.

         ‘The cutlasses are on the table. He put a different kind on it.’     Kindred pronoun énìná ‘one of this kind’ displays combinatorial potential rela-
tive to postnominal modifiers. In doing so, it neutralizes the plural number value of
its prefix. énìná combines with the contrastive demonstrative modifier, although not
with either deictic demonstrative.énìná     nóì                              *énìná      nà / àìn

ing in phonological shape to its nominal modifier counterpart. Quantifier pronouns
do not reflect person, case, gender, or discourse status. Existential quantifier forms
inflect for number via prefixation.
     Universal quantifier pronouns manifest the types collective (èrèmé ‘all, every-
one, everything’) and distributive (òdóòdé ‘each one’). Distributive exhibits limited
occurrence, since it refers only to humans. Existential quantifiers show contrasting
root forms that inflect for number with alternating vowel prefixes: ósò ‘certain one,’
ésò ‘certain ones’ and óvbèé ‘another one,’ évbèé ‘other ones.’
     Quantifiers in partitive vbi phrases exhibit restricted distribution. Partitive exis-
tential ósò appears as head relative to a prepositional vbi phrase, whose comple-
ment is marked inflectionally (e.g. ívbèkhàn not óvbèkhàn) or syntactically (e.g. élí)
as plural or is construed as plural.ósó vbí élí émà / élí ívbèkhàn / *ólí óvbèkhàn

262 | Pronouns and conjunctionWhile complements of vbi accept lexically headed noun phrases, they allow locative
pronoun ò, which is nondeictic. They do not permit a deictic pronoun (èvbò).ósó vbí ò / *èvbò

tive universal quantifier èrèmé co-refers to an antecedent noun phrase in a preced-
ing sentence.(62) òjè tón      élí émà. ò húá           èrèmé yé      èkìn.

[Oje PRP.meet the youths he PRP.take each move.to house] ‘Oje met the youths. He

other.one move.to market] ‘Oje harvested the yams. He took another one to market’).
    Nonetheless, partitive existential ósò occurs with a following vbi phrase and its
nondeictic locative pronoun ò as complement (ósó vbì ò). Through obligatory con-
strual of the vbi complement as plural, and direct coreference of this complement
with an antecedent noun phrase, ósò co-refers indirectly. No other quantifier dis-
plays similar indirect anaphoric behavior.(63) a. òjè tón       élí émà.

         ‘Oje harvested the yams. He took all / each of them to market.’    Numeral pronouns greater than ‘one’ include the types cardinal (e.g. èvá ‘two’),
ordinal (e.g. ózèvà ‘second’), collective (e.g. èvèvá ‘all two, both, twosome’) and
distributive (e.g. èvéèvá ‘two-two each’). Each type is identical in phonological
shape to its corresponding postdeterminer. Numeral òkpá ‘one’ shows distinct car-
dinal (òkpá ‘one’) and distributive forms (òkpóòkpá ‘one-one each’). And since it
expresses ‘same’ with respect to kin relations, it reflects a collective sense as well.
     Numeral pronouns occur in the syntactic relations subject and direct object,
where they refer to participants in the situational context. Only ordinal forms re-
quire the definite predeterminer.(64) a. èvá / ólí ózèvà / èvèvá ríì        vbí èkìn.

        ‘The women took two-two each to market.’     Numeral pronouns exhibit restricted distribution in partitive phrases. Cardinal
numeral pronouns occur as partitive head, where they are followed by a preposi-
tional vbi phrase whose complement consists of a plural lexical form or the nondeic-
tic locative pronoun ò. Deictic locatives (e.g. èvbò) as complement are disallowed.èvá vbí élí émà / élí ívbèkhàn / *ólí óvbèkhàn

‘one of the youths’                      ‘one of the youths’    Numeral pronouns do not uniformly appear as anaphors. Collective (èvèvá) and
cardinal (èvá) numeral shapes corefer to a noun phrase referent in a preceding sen-
tence. Distributive (èvéèvá) and ordinal (ólí ózèvà) numerals, however, fail to co-
refer in a similar fashion.

indirectly. When head of a partitive phrase, a cardinal numeral (through its vbi
phrase complement, nondeictic locative pronoun ò) indirectly co-refers to a noun
phrase in a preceding sentence. Remaining numeral forms fail to co-refer indirectly.(66) a. òjè tón        élí émà. ò húá         èvá vbì ò yé         èkìn.

Four interrogative pronouns occur in Emai. All but one exhibit variation in phono-
logical shape of their final vowel conditioned by the nature of the following phono-
logical segment. When they are followed by a vowel or a clause boundary, their final
vowel is [e]. When followed by a consonant, their final vowel is [i]. Interrogative
pronouns reflect four gender distinctions: animate, inanimate, place, and amount.
Only animate reveals a singular/plural number prefix. Interrogative pronouns are
also co-indexed to a matrix clause position expressed as a pronoun or a zero pro-
266 | Pronouns and conjunctionnoun. To form question categories beyond these four, interrogative pronouns com-
bine with lexical or grammatical morphemes (Chapter 7, 7.5.2).óé', óí' / éé', éí'                   ékà
‘who’ sg / pl                         ‘how many / how much’
émé' / émí'                           ébé' / ébí'
‘what’                                ‘where’    The animate interrogative pronoun pair óé'/ói' ‘who sg’ and éé'/éí' ‘who pl’
show an initial vowel alternation that reflects number. Each requires number
agreement vis-à-vis its corresponding matrix clause position (e.g. subject ó ~ é or
direct object óì ~ íyàìn).(67) a. óé' ó / éé' é      híán'     ólí óràn?

        who who Oje PAP.hit him them stick
        ‘Whom did Oje hit with a stick?’The number contrast for the animate interrogative is retained even when the corre-
sponding matrix position shows a zero pronoun, as with indirect object position
following Applicative li/ni.(68) óé' / éé'   ólí ómóhé ré'       émà ní?
     whom whom the man PAP.take yam APP
     ‘Whom did the man give yam to?’The animate interrogative’s final vowel alternates. When the following segment is a
consonant, the pronoun final vowel is [i], regardless of referent number.(69) óí' / éí'   vbá ré'         émà ní?
     whom whom you PAP.take yam APP
     ‘Whom did you give yam to?’When the following segment is a vowel or when the interrogative pronoun occurs in
situ (i.e. echo questions), the pronoun final vowel is [e], regardless of number.(70) a. óé' / éé'    ó ré'         émà ní?
        whom whom he PAP.take yam APP
        ‘Whom did he give yam to?’

        he PAP.take yam APP whom whom
        ‘He gave yam to whom?’    Interrogative pronoun émé'/émí' does not inflect for number. It reveals final
vowel alternation [e ~ i] conditioned by the following phonological segment. When a
consonant follows, the pronoun final vowel is [i]. When a vowel follows or when the
pronoun occurs in situ in an echo question (ò ú émèé? [he PRP.do what] ‘He did
what?’), the final segment is [e].(71) émí' vbá ú'-ì?                      émé' ó ú'-ì?
     what you PAP.do-F                   what he PAP.do-F
     ‘What did you do?’                  ‘What did he do?’The émé'/émí' interrogative corresponds to different matrix clause grammatical
relations as indicated by pronoun shape. Relative to subject position, émé'/émí'
corresponds to a definite personal pronoun such as ó.(72) émé' ó sá'        ólí ómòhè?
     what it PAP.sting the man
     ‘What stung the man?’For other grammatical relations, single verb direct objects, direct objects after a verb
in series (re) or direct objects followed by li/ni indirect objects, émé'/émí' corre-
sponds to a zero pronoun.(73) a. émé' ólí ómóhé é'-ì?
        what the man PAP.eat-F
        ‘What did the man eat?’
     b. émé' ólí ómóhé ré'         híán ólí óràn?
        what the man PAP.use cut the wood
        ‘What did the man use to cut the wood?’
     c. émé' ólí ómóhé ré'          lí   ònwìmè?
        what the man PAP.take APP farmer
        ‘What did the man give to the farmer?’     The interrogative pronoun for place shows final vowel alternation between [e ~
i] conditioned by phonological context. When a consonant follows, pronoun final
vowel is [í]. When in situ (òjè yé ébèé'? [Oje PRP.move.to where] ‘Oje went where?’)
or when a vowel follows, the pronoun final vowel is [é].

     ‘Where did you move to?’          ‘Where did he move to?’The place interrogative pronoun never corresponds to a grammatical pronoun in its
matrix clause. It consistently corresponds to a zero pronoun. When place in the
matrix clause articulates an adjunct relation, the matrix clause verb phrase shows
an obligatory locational verb za in series.(75) a. ébé' ó zá'            ù?
        where he PAP.be.loc die
        ‘Where did he die?’

     c. ébé' ólí ómóhé zá'            híán ólí óràn?
        where the man PAP.be.loc cut the wood
        ‘Where did the man cut the wood?’When the matrix place relation is subcategorized as verb argument, za is disal-
lowed. No other marking of place relation in the matrix clause occurs.(76) a. ébé' ólí ókpósó (*zá) ríì?

        ‘Where did the woman enter?’     The quantity interrogative pronoun ékà exhibits a constant phonological shape.
Its form is not conditioned by number or phonological environment. ékà corre-
sponds to different anaphoric shapes in the matrix clause. Its corresponding subject
position requires a personal pronoun (o).(77) ékà      ó rì      vbí ááìn?

"8.1.5.2 Partitive ri / e
A Partitive (PAR) function distinct from EXT and LCT is expressed by predicates ri
and e: NP ri vbi o and NP e vbi o. Its construction consists of an initial noun phrase,
either of the verbs ri or e, and a vbi complement consisting of the nondeictic locative
pronoun. PAR asserts a partitive relation between a subject referent and an assumed
456 | Be, do, happen and haveplurality indexed by nondeictic locative pronoun ò. Canonical PAR constructions
restrict their grammatical shape in the fashion of Existential constructions.
     PAR constructions exhibit few properties normally associated with verbs. ri in-
flects for aspect with an irregular tone pattern and fails to allow auxiliaries and
preverbs. Regarding aspect, PAR ri permits Present perfect (right edge low tone
subject and a high low verb tone). In typical verb phrases, high low tone occurs on
auxiliaries and preverbs, not verbs. Morever, PAR ri fails to inflect for imperfect or
prospective aspect.(83) ólí ómòhè ríì     vbì ò.
     the man PRP.be LOC them
     ‘The man is among them.’PAR e constructions never show aspect in the affirmative. They fail to inflect for
perfect, imperfect or prospective aspect.(84) a. *ólí ómóhé ló      è vbì ò.
         the man PRED be LOC them
         ‘The man will be among them.’
     b. *ólí ómóhé ó ò è vbì ò.
         the man SC H be LOC them
         ‘The man was among them.’     PAR constructions, regardless of ri or e as predicate, do not accept any auxilia-
ries or preverbs, as suggested by unacceptable epistemic Certaintive ma, relative
tense kpe, aspectualizer preverb Repetitive che and evaluative preverb kuku, among
others (*ólí ómóhé má' / kpé' / ché' / kú'kù rì vbì ò [the man PAP.CER SUB REP EVAL
be LOC them] ‘The man surely / yet / again / after all was among them’).
     In PAR constructions polarity and mood are limited. ri constructions occur as
polar interrogatives (ólí ómòhè ríì vbì ò? [the man PRP.be LOC them] ‘Is the man
among them?’) but never as negatives (*ólí ómòhè í ì rì vbì ò [the man SC NEG be LOC
them] ‘The man was not among them’) or as imperatives or prohibitives.
     PAR e constructions require Perfect Negation. In addition, they appear as polar
interrogatives but never as imperatives or prohibitives.(85) a. ómòhè í ì       è vbì ò.
        male SC NEG be LOC them

     Noun phrase positions in PAR constructions respond asymmetrically to reposi-
tioning in discourse. ri and e constructions behave dissimilarly as well. With ri, PAR
subject corresponds to a constituent designated as positive focus li/ni, negative
focus ki, or topic. PAR subject fails to correspond to an interrogative pronoun. In e
constructions, PAR subject never corresponds to a constituent in focus, topic or
question word position. Similarly restricted are vbi complements, which fail to cor-
respond to any discourse position: focus, topic or question word.(89) a. ògbòbè        òkpá lí ó rì        vbì ò.

verb, u has no gerundive form (*úùmí).(90) a. ólì òkpòsò ú         óì.

tinctive properties. Verb phrase properties pertain to polarity and mood, verb suffix-
es, inflection, auxiliary categories, preverb categories and postverbal particles.
Noun phrase properties include NP type, animacy, syntactic shape and correspond-
ence to discourse defined positions. This same u form, in collocation with particular
nouns, also expresses a range of meanings translated as ‘act, behave, execute,
achieve, perform’ (Chapter 8, 8.4).","[481, 482, 483, 484, 485]"

  A note on adverb order concerns the simile phrase marked by bi. It manifests highly restricted
distribution relative to all adverb classes except ideophones. Simile exponents follow but do not
precede Manner ideophones (kpèkèkpèkè, nyágányágá, bìbìbíbí).(i) ójè ò ó shàn nyágányágá, bí ólí émáí nwú              vbì ègèìn.
    Oje SC C walk awkwardly like one boil PAP.catch LOC crotch
    ‘Oje is walking awkwardly, like someone who has a boil at the crotch.’Simile expressions with bi never occur with Manner-demonstrative adverbs, e.g. ìná, regardless of
the latter’s position.(ii) *ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó è émáé, bí éwè ìná.
      the youth      SC C eat food like goat PMD
      ‘The youth is eating food like a goat that way.’
344 | Adverbial adjunctsLikewise, simile bi phrases fail to precede or follow adverbs of Temporal Deixis (ènyáà), Frequency
(sáà) or Place (vbì ìwè).(iii) a. *ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó è émáé ènyáà, bí éwè.
          the youth      SC C eat food just.now like goat
          ‘The youth is eating food just now like a goat.’
      b. *ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó è émáé sáà,             bí éwè.
          the youth      SC H eat food always like goat
          ‘The youth always eats food like a goat.’
      c. *ólí óvbèkhàn ò ó è émáé vbì ìwè, bí éwè.
          the youth      SC C eat food LOC house like goat
          ‘The youth is eating food in the house like a goat.’12
   Additional exemplars with ideophonic adverbs involve complex predications, as in hian ku o
‘strike’ vs hian ku o wóò ‘smack’.(i) a. ó híán'         úkpàsánmì kú         ó vbí ótóí   wóò.
       he PAP.strike cane         disperse CL LOC ground smack
       ‘He smacked his cane all over the ground.’
    b. ó híán'         úkpàsánmì kú         ó vbì òtòì.
       he PAP.strike cane         disperse CL LOC ground
       ‘He struck his cane all over the ground.’13
  Although verb complement particles (Change of State a, Change of Location o, Applicative li/ni
and Temporal Perspective lee) also appear in postverbal position, they tend to precede adverbs,
except in the case of Temporal Perspective, which precedes or follows a Place adverb. Temporal
Perspective lee co-occurs with Frequency, Place and Deixis, but never with Manner, Manner-
demonstrative or Extent.
  Temporal Perspective lee precedes but does not follow adverbs of Temporal Deixis (òdè) and
Frequency (èdèdé, ìsòkpá, édèédè).(i) a. ólí ómóhé é'         ólí émàè léé       òdè.

       the man SC H eat food ASS his TEMP daily
       ‘The man finishes eating his food daily.’The lee particle differentially interacts with verbs regarding its order relative to Place adverbs. lee
precedes or follows a Place adverb (vbí íú) with change of state verbs like ton ‘roast.’

        he PRP.roast yam TEMP LOC hearth my
        ‘He has finished roasting yam on my hearth.’With change of state verbs like gbe ‘kill,’ lee precedes the Place adverb (vbì ìwè).(iii) ólí ómòhè gbé       ólí ófè léé     vbí ímè.
      the man PRP.kill the rat TEMP LOC farm
      ‘The man has finished killing the rat on the farm.’Following activity verbs, e.g. e ‘eat,’ lee only follows a Place adverb (vbì ìwè).(iv) ólí ómòhè é         émáé vbì ìwè       léé.
     the man PRP.eat food LOC house TEMP
     ‘The man finished eating food at the house.’Postverbal lee does not co-occur with adverbs expressing Manner (bìbìbíbí), Extent (kóíkóí, sésésé)
or Manner-demonstrative (ìyó).(v) a. *ò ó lá bìbìbíbí           léé.
        he C run staggeringly TEMP
        ‘He is staggering already.’

        the man PAP.eat the food TEMP DMD
        ‘The man ate the food already that way.’  A form semantically and syntactically related to lee exhibits a more restricted distribution. Post-

"3.2.1.1 Phasal che, gbo, se, ghe
Phasal aspectualizers constrain auxiliary categories, sentence mood and polarity.
They also constrain one another, particularly with respect to linear order. Repetitive
(REP) che ‘again’ brings an event, including its participants, into perspective and
asserts event repetition over an interval on the time axis.
118 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs(52) ólí ómóhé ché'       é émà.
     the man PAP.REP eat yam
     ‘The man again ate yam.’Additive (ADD) gbo ‘too, also’ brings an event into perspective and asserts addition-
al event occurrence over a time expanse. Re-occurrence denoted by gbo is not lim-
ited by participant identity or temporal immediacy, as it is with Repetitive che.(53) ólí ómóhé gbó'        é ólí émàè.
     the man PAP.ADD eat the food
     ‘The man also ate the food / ate the food too.’Durative (DUR) se ‘still, continue, keep on’ profiles an event subphase and asserts
phasal duration relative to a definite point on the time axis. It often carries an impli-
cation that the speaker expected some other event to intervene or take its place.(54) ólí ómòhè séè          é vbí ólí émàè.
     the man PRP.DUR eat LOC the food
     ‘The man has still eaten / has continued to eat from the food.’Punctual (PCT) ghe ‘just’ highlights an event subphase or the event itself and asserts
proximity of phasal onset or endpoint, depending on aspect, to time of utterance or
some other temporal reference point.(55) a. ólí ómóhé ghé'        híán ólí óràn.
        the man PAP.PCT cut the wood

     b. ólí ómòhè ò ó ghé è émáé ènyáà.
        the man SC C PCT eat food just.now
        ‘The man is just eating food right now.’    Relative to one another, phasal aspectualizers exhibit a complex linear order
scheme. Durative se precedes but never follows Repetitive che (ólí ómóhé sé' chè ré
óbò só ólí éwè [the man PAP.DUR REP use hand touch the goat] ‘The man still
touched the goat with his hand again’), Additive gbo (ólí ómòhè séè gbò é vbí ólí

or Punctual ghe (ólí ómóhé sé' ghè khóó à [the man PAP.DUR PCT bathe CS] ‘The
man still just bathed / The man just continued to bathe’).
    Among Repetitive, Additive and Punctual forms order is flexible. Each precedes
or follows the other: ólí ómòhè chéè gbò é émàè [the man PRP.REP ADD eat food]
‘The man has again eaten food too’, ólí ómòhè gbóò chè é émàè [the man PRP.ADD

      Phasal aspectualizers, particularly when compared to boundary forms, evince
few restrictions regarding aspectual inflection, modality and relative tense. Phasal
preverbs tend to occur with each aspect. Repetitive che allows Past perfect (ólí
ómóhé ché' é émàè [the man PAP.REP eat food] ‘The man again ate food’), Present
perfect (ólí ómòhè chéè é émàè [the man PRP.REP eat food] ‘The man again has eaten
food’), imperfect Continuous (ólí ómòhè ò ó ché è émàè [the man SC C REP eat food]
‘The man is eating food again’), prospective Predictive (ólí ómóhé ló chè é vbí ólí
émàè [the man PRED REP eat LOC the food] ‘The man will again eat from the food’),
and prospective Anticipative (ólí ómòhè ló chè é émàè [the man ANTI REP eat food]
‘The man is about to eat food again’). Repetitive che fails in the Habitual.
      Additive gbo appears in Past perfect (ólí ómóhé gbó' é ólí émàè [the man
PAP.ADD eat the food] ‘The man also ate the food / ate the food too’), Present per-
fect (ólí ómòhè gbóò é ólí émàè [the man PRP.ADD ate the food] ‘The man has also
eaten the food’), imperfect Continuous (ólí ómòhè ò ó gbó è ólí émàè [the man SC C

will also eat the food’), and Anticipative (ólí ómòhè ló gbò é ólí émàè [the man ANTI
ADD eat the food] ‘The man is about to eat the food too’).
      Durative se occurs in Present perfect (ólí ómòhè séè é vbí ólí émàè [the man
PRP.DUR eat LOC the food] ‘The man has still eaten / has continued to eat from the
food’), imperfect Continuous (ólí ómòhè ò ó sé kpè ólì ìtásà [the man SC C DUR wash

Anticipative (ólí ómòhè ló sè é ólí émàè [the man ANTI DUR eat the food] ‘The man is
still about to / is about to continue to eat the food’), but not Past perfect, imperfect
Habitual or prospective Predictive.
      And Punctual ghe takes Past perfect (ólí ómóhé ghé' híán ólí óràn [the man
PAP.PCT cut the wood] ‘The man just cut the wood’), imperfect Continuous (ólí
ómòhè ò ó ghé è émáé ènyáà [the man SC C PCT eat food just.now] ‘The man is just

fect, imperfect Habitual or prospective Predictive.
120 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs     Relative to modality, phasal aspectualizers show differential constraints. Fol-
lowing deontic Hortative í are Repetitive che (ólí ómòhè í chè kpé ólì ìtásà [the man
HOR REP wash the plate] ‘The man should wash the plate again’), Additive gbo (ólí
ómòhè í gbò é ólí émàè [the man HOR ADD eat the food] ‘The man should eat the

‘The man should still eat the food’), and Punctual ghe (ólí ómòhè í ghè é ólí émàè [the
man HOR PCT eat the food] ‘The man should just eat the food’).
     Phasal aspectualizers restrict occurrence with epistemic modality. This is par-
ticularly true of Punctual ghe, less so of Durative se, and even less of Repetitive che
and Additive gbo. Repetitive che follows each epistemic form, with Dubitatives and
assumptive rere requiring an interrogative: (ólí ómòhè záà chè é émàè [the man
PRP.DED REP eat food] ‘The man must have eaten food again’), (ólí ómóhé zá' chè é
émàè [the man PAP.RES REP eat food] ‘As a result the man again ate food’), (ólí
ómóhé má' chè é émàè [the man PAP.CER REP eat food] ‘The man surely ate food

even eat food again?’), and (ólí ómóhé khà ché é ólí émàè [the man PAP.HYP REP eat
the food] ‘The man would have again eaten the food’).
     In quite similar fashion, Additive gbo follows each epistemic auxiliary except
assumptive rere: (ólí ómòhè záà gbò é émàè [the man PRP.DED ADD eat food] ‘The
man must have eaten food too’), (ólí ómóhé zá' gbò é émàè [the man PAP.RES ADD
eat food] ‘As a result the man also ate food’), (ólí ómóhé má' gbò é émàè [the man
PAP.CER ADD eat food] ‘The man surely ate food too’), (ólí ómóhé vbá' gbò é émàè?
[the man PAP.DUB ADD eat food] ‘Could the man really eat food too?’), (ólí ómòhè
vbáà gbò é ólí émàè? [the man PRP.DUB ADD eat the food] ‘Could the man really

[the man PRP.DUB ADD eat the food] ‘Has the man actually eaten the food too?’),
and (ólí ómóhé khà gbó é émàè [the man PAP.HYP ADD eat food] ‘The man would
have eaten food too’).
     Durative se follows each epistemic auxiliary except Certaintive ma. With as-
sumptive rere as well as Dubitatives, se requires an interrogative: (ólí ómòhè záà sè é
ólí émàè [the man PRP.DED DUR eat the food] ‘The man must have continued to eat
the food’), (ólí ómóhé zá' sè é ólí émàè [the man PAP.RES DUR eat the food] ‘As a

(ólí ómòhè bíà sè é ólí émàè? [the man PRP.DUB DUR eat the food] ‘Has the man

ómóhé khà sé é ólí émàè [the man PAP.HYP DUR eat the food] ‘The man would have
continued to eat the food’).
     More restricted than any other phasal aspectualizer is ghe. It does not co-occur
with dubitatives or assumptive judgment Concessive rere. ghe combines with ra-
tional judgment za, assumptive kha, and speculative ma: (ólí ómòhè záà ghè é émàè
[the man PRP.DED PCT eat the food] ‘The man must have just eaten the food’), (ólí
ómóhé zá' ghè é ólí émàè [the man PAP.RES PCT eat the food] ‘As a result the man
just ate the food’), (ólí ómóhé má' ghè é ólí émàè [the man PAP.CER PCT eat the food]
‘The man surely just ate the food’), and (ólí ómóhé khà ghé é ólí émàè [the man
PAP.HYP PCT eat the food] ‘The man would have just eaten the food’).
     Phasal aspectualizers limit co-occurrence with relative tense auxiliaries. Forms
gbo, ghe and se tend to fail with Anterior ke or Subsequent kpe. It is only che that
follows each relative tense form. It requires an interrogative structure with Anterior
ke (ólí ómòhè kéè chè é émàè? [the man PRP.ANT REP eat food] ‘Did the man eat food
again anymore?’), but not with kpe (ólí ómóhé kpé' chè é émàè [the man PAP.SUB
REP eat food] ‘The man yet ate food again’).
     As a subclass, phasal forms minimally restrict sentence mood and polarity. che,
gbo, se and ghe appear in imperative constructions: (chè é vbí ólí émàè [REP eat LOC
the food] ‘Eat from the food again’), (gbò é vbí ólí émàè [ADD eat LOC the food] ‘Eat
from the food too’), (sè é ólí émàè [DUR eat the food] ‘Continue eating the food’), and
(ghè é ólí émàè léé [PCT eat the food TEMP] ‘Just eat up all the food / Just finish eat-
ing the food’).
     Neither Additive gbo nor Punctual ghe occur in prohibitives. Both Repetitive che
and Durative se do: (é è chè é vbí ólí émàè [you PR REP eat LOC the food] ‘Don't eat
from the food again’), and (é è sè é ólí émàè [you PR DUR eat the food] ‘Don't con-
tinue eating the food’).
     Each phasal aspectualizer appears in polar questions: (ólí ómóhé ché' é émàè?
[the man PAP.REP eat food] ‘Did the man eat food again?’), (ólí ómòhè chéè é émàè?
[the man PRP.REP eat food] ‘Has the man eaten food again?’), (ólí ómóhé gbó' é vbí
ólí émàè? [the man PAP.ADD eat LOC the food] ‘Did the man eat from the food too?’),
(ólí ómòhè gbóò è vbí ólí émàè? [the man PRP.ADD eat LOC the food] ‘Has the man

[the man SC C PCT eat food just.now] ‘Is the man just eating food now?’).
     All but Punctual ghe occur with Perfect Negation: (ólí ómòhè í ì ché è vbí ólí

122 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs3.2.1.2 Boundary ya, mo, òó
Boundary aspectualizers profile the temporal onset or endpoint of an event under
realis or irrealis conditions or single out the endpoint of an event as one phase of a
distal past expanse of time. Among boundary forms, òó, ya and mo express five
distinct functions. òó conveys a Conative function; ya specifies Ingressive and Past
Absolute functions; and mo articulates Egressive and a contrasting Past Absolute
function. For both ya and mo, subject phrase tone distinguishes Past Absolute from
Ingressive/Egressive.
     Conative (CON) òó ‘go to’ brings event onset into perspective and asserts a rela-
tion between subject volition/desire and event occurrence. The speaker remains
noncommittal as to event onset or completion.(56) ólí ómòhè ó ó'      è ólí émàè.
     the man SC CON eat the food
     ‘The man has gone to eat the food.’    The boundary form ya conveys Ingressive and Past Absolute functions. With
right edge low tone subject, ya with inherent low tone expresses an Ingressive (IG)
function. It brings event onset into perspective and asserts failure to achieve onset.
Ingressive ya does not arise with a right edge high tone subject.(57) a. ólí ómòhè yà       é ólí émàè.
        the man PRP.IG eat the food
        ‘The man almost started eating the food (but didn't get started).’
     b. ólí ómòhè yà       gbé ólí ákhè á.
        the man PRP.IG break the pot CS
        ‘The man almost started to break the pot.’Ingressive ya accepts temporal adverb èghéènà ‘just recently’ but not past adverbs
òdè ‘yesterday’ or ìghéèghé ‘generations ago,’ or temporal predeterminer élá ‘the
temporal unit we discussed.’(58) òjè yà       gbé ófé èghéènà / *òdè / *élá úkpè / *ìghéèghé.
     Oje PRP.IG kill rat recently          yesterday TP year long.ago
     ‘Oje almost killed a rat just recently.’    When preceded by a right edge high tone subject, ya exhibits a Past Absolute
(PA) function rendered ‘used to, formerly.’ It profiles the endpoint of an event as a
subphase of an interval of past time, asserting event occurrence in the past and
implying its present nonoccurrence. Right edge low tone subjects do not convey the
Past Absolute function.
                                                            Preverb categories | 123(59) ólí ómóhé yà          gbé élí éfé élá úkpè.
     the man    PAP.PA kill the rats TP year
     ‘The man used to kill the rats in the year we discussed.’Past Absolute ya is compatible with nonDAY adverbs bearing a distal relation to the
present such as past generation (e.g. ìghéèghé) or past discourse (élá úkpè). Past
Absolute ya is incompatible with DAY adverbs like òdè ‘yesterday.’(60) a. ójé yà        móé éghó' ìghéèghé.
        Oje PAP.PA have money generations.ago
        ‘Oje used to have money long ago.’
     b. ójé yà         khúéé ìbè    ní ámáí élá úkpè / *òdè.
        Oje PAP.PA play drum APP us             TP y ear      yesterday
        ‘Oje used to play the drum for us in the year we talked about.’    Aspectualizer mo functions correlate with a tone contrast in the subject phrase.
With right edge low tone subject, mo manifests an Egressive (EG) function. Showing
a retrospective view of an event, mo profiles an event's temporal endpoint and as-
serts failure to attain endpoint. Verbs lacking an inherent temporal endpoint, such
as e ‘eat,’ become compatible with Egressive mo through co-occurrence with post-
verbal particle lee.(61) ólí ómòhè móò     é ólí émàè léé.
     the man PRP.EG eat the food TEMP
     ‘The man almost completed / finished eating the food.’Inherently bounded verbs like voon ‘be full’ do not require lee. Egressive mo occurs
with the right edge low tone subject of the Present perfect, not the Past perfect.(62) ólì ùbèlè móò        vòòn.
     the gourd PRP.EG be.full
     ‘The gourd is almost full.’Aspectualizer mo conveys Past Absolute (PA) with the right edge high tone subject
of the Past perfect. Translated ‘at a time in the past, formerly,’ it highlights event
endpoint as one subphase from a past expanse of time not extending back to distal
past of previous generations. Past Absolute mo asserts event occurrence during the
past without an implication of present nonoccurrence. Past Absolute mo fails to
arise with the right edge low tone subject of the Present perfect.

        the man PAP.PA speak DMD
        ‘The man at one time / formerly spoke that way.’
     b. ólí úbélé mó'       vòòn.
        the gourd PAP.PA be.full
        ‘The gourd at one time / formerly was full.’Relative to temporal adverbials, Past Absolute mo accepts temporal predeterminer
élá ‘the time discussed’ but not ìghéèghé ‘past generations’ or òdè ‘yesterday.’(64) ójé mó'       gbé ófé élá úkpè / *ìghéèghé / *òdè.
     Oje PAP.PA kill rat TP year          long.ago     yesterday
     ‘Oje at one time killed rats during the year we discussed.’     As a subclass, boundary aspectualizers are extremely limited in their co-
occurrence potential. Due to contrasting tonal conditions and meanings, the distinct
functions of ya are incompatible with each other, as are the distinct functions of mo.
It is also not possible to combine ya and mo, regardless of their functions. As for
Conative òó, it precedes Ingressive ya, but only in imperatives, not declaratives.
Conative òó is also ungrammatical with remaining boundary forms, irrespective of
linear order.(65) òó yà é ólí émàè.
     CON IG eat the food
     ‘Go to start eating the food.’    Boundary aspectualizers restrict inflection as well as auxiliary modality and rel-
ative tense. Conative òó appears in Present perfect and prospective Anticipative but
not Past perfect, prospective Predictive or imperfect aspect.(66) a. ólí ómòhè ó ó'       è ólí émàè.
        the man SC CON eat the food

man PAP.HYP CON eat food] ‘The man would have gone to eat food’), and (ólí ómóhé
ré' ó è émàè [the man PAP.CONC CON eat food] ‘The man even went to eat food’).
     Conative òó follows relative tense, with Anterior ke requiring an interrogative
construction: (ólí ómòhè kéè ó è ólí émàè? [the man PRP.ANT CON eat the food] ‘Did
the man go to eat the food afterward?’), and (ólí ómóhé kpé' ó è ólí émàè [the man
PAP.SUB CON eat the food] ‘Despite knowing pending conditions, the man still went
to eat the food’).
     Ingressive ya limits inflection and auxiliary expression.4 It shows Present per-
fect only, rejecting imperfect and prospective. Ingressive ya restricts modality. It
fails with deontic Hortative í or any epistemic form. Likewise, Ingressive ya fails
with relative tense forms ke and kpe.
     Past Absolute ya severely restricts auxiliaries. It requires Past perfect but rejects
Present perfect, imperfect and prospective aspect. Relative to modality, Past Abso-
lute ya is also highly restricted. It fails with deontic Hortative and all epistemic
forms. As well, its fails with relative tense ke or kpe.
     The distribution of Egressive mo is somewhat less retricted than other boundary
forms. It requires Present perfect. But it fails in Past perfect, imperfect and prospec-
tive. Regarding modality, Egressive mo fails with deontic Hortative í and all epistem-
ic forms except Deductive za.(67) ólí ómòhè záà      mò é ólí émàè léé.
     the man PRP.DED EG eat the food TEMP
     ‘The man must have almost finished eating the food.’Egressive mo follows only Anterior ke from relative tense.(68) ólí ómóhé ké'        mò é ólí émàè léé.
     the man PAP.ANT EG eat the food TEMP
     ‘The man almost finished eating the food afterward.’     The Past Absolute function of mo severely restricts auxiliaries. It requires Past
perfect but disallows Present perfect, imperfect or prospective. Past Absolute mo
fails with deontic Hortative, all epistemic forms as well as both relative tense forms.
     Boundary aspectualizers severely limit sentence mood and polarity. Only Cona-
tive òó and Ingressive ya allow imperatives, with verbs like je ‘laugh’ requiring ya.
126 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsNeither Egressive mo, Past Absolute ya nor Past Absolute mo occur in imperatives.
No boundary forms appear in prohibitives.(69) a. òó è ólí émàè.

        ‘Go to eat the food.’
     b. yà é ólí émàè.
        IG eat the food
        ‘Start eating the food.’Relative to polar interrogatives, boundary preverbs reveal a distinct pattern. Cona-
tive òó and either Past Absolute ya or mo appear in polar questions. Ingressive ya
and Egressive mo do not. No boundary aspectualizers occur in negative statements.(70) a. ólí ómòhè ó ó' è ólí émàè?
        the man SC CON eat the food
       ‘Has the man gone to eat the food?’

     c. ólí ómóhé mó'        gbé ófé élá úkpè?
        the man PAP.PA kill rat TP year
        ‘Did the man at one time kill rats during the year we discussed.’3.2.1.3 Co-occurrence of phasal and boundary forms
Linear order and sentence mood constrain co-occurrence of phasal and boundary
aspectualizers. In declaratives, Conative follows each phasal preverb che, gbo, se
and ghe: (ólí ómòhè chéè ó è émàè [the man PRP.REP CON eat food] ‘The man again
went to eat food’), (ólí ómòhè gbóò ó è émàè [the man PRP.ADD CON eat food] ‘The
man also went to eat food’), (ólí ómòhè séè ó è ólí émàè [the man PRP.DUR CON eat
the food] ‘The man continued to go to eat the food’), and (ólí ómóhé ghé' ó è ólí
émàè [the man PAP.PCT CON eat the food] ‘The man just went to eat the food’).
     More restricted in distribution is Egressive mo. It follows Punctual ghe but no
other phasal preverb: (ólí ómóhé ghé' mò é ólí émàè léé [the man PAP.PCT EG eat the
food TEMP] ‘The man just almost finished eating the food’).
     Ingressive ya is unacceptable with phasal ghe and se. It precedes rather than
follows phasal che and gbo: (ólí ómòhè yà ché é vbí ólí émàè [the man PRP.IG REP eat
LOC the food] ‘The man almost ate from the food again’), and (ólí ómòhè yà gbò é vbí
ólí émàè [the man PRP.IG ADD eat LOC the food] ‘The man almost ate from the food
too’).
                                                             Preverb categories | 127     More limited is Past Absolute ya, which precedes only se among phasal forms.
And Past Absolute mo fails with all phasal preverbs: (ólí ómóhé yà sé gbé ófé élá
úkpè [the man PAP.PA DUR kill rat TP year] ‘The man used to still kill rats during the
year we discussed’).
     Phasal and boundary forms combine differently in imperatives. Conative pre-
cedes or follows Durative se. It does not co-occur with other phasal forms in impera-
tives, regardless of linear order: (sè ó è émàè [DUR CON eat food] ‘Continue going to
eat food’), and (òó sè é émàè [CON DUR eat food] ‘Go to eat food meanwhile’).
     In imperatives, Ingressive ya does not occur with Repetitive che or Additive gbo.
However, it precedes Durative se and Punctual ghe: (yà sé é ólí émàè [IG DUR eat the
food] ‘Start eating the food meanwhile’), and (yà ghé é ólí émàè [IG PCT eat the food]
‘Just start eating the food’).
     Still more complex combinations of phasal and boundary aspectualizers occur.
A sampling reveals the potential for Ingressive ya to follow Conative òó and phasal
forms che, gbo, se and ghe, and for phasal se in these same structures to follow
Punctual ghe: (ólí ómòhè í yà ghé sè tón ókà é [the man HOR IG PCT DUR harvest
maize eat] ‘The man should just continue to start harvesting maize and eating it’),
(ólí ómòhè séè ó yà híán óràn [the man PRP.DUR CON IG cut wood] ‘The man contin-
ued to go to start cutting wood’), and (ólí ómòhè ghéè ó yà híán óràn [the man
PRP.PCT CON IG cut wood] ‘The man just went to start cutting wood’).","[143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153]"

"3.2.7 Preverb co-occurrenceRelative to one another preverb classes exhibit distributional limitations.18 Aspectu-
alizer preverbs will be considered first for their potential to co-occur with exemplars
of other classes. Subsequently, the potential of remaining preverb classes will be
considered in the order evaluative, temporal, manner-demonstrative, subject attrib-
utive and quantity. Positioned relative to verb (V), preverb classes exhibit the fol-
lowing linear order:
                        ASP EVAL / TEMP MD SA Q V3.2.7.1 Aspectualizers with other preverbs
Aspectualizers belonging to subclasses phasal and boundary reveal distinct pat-
terns of co-occurrence and order vis-à-vis other preverbs. Phasal preverbs (che, gbo,
se, ghe) combine with exemplars of the other five preverb classes. Relative to evalu-
atives, their distribution is limited; only se appears with evaluative duu. Neither che,
gbo nor ghe aspectualizer combines with any evaluative.

      the man PAP.DUR EVAL eat the food
      ‘The man still / meanwhile in fact ate the food.’     Each phasal aspectualizer constrains remaining preverb classes. With subject
attributives, che is found with intentional miti (ólí ómóhé ché' mítì várè? [the man
PAP.REP able come] ‘Was the man able to come again?’) and each attitudinal form:
gbúdu (ólí ómòhè chéè gbúdù váré'? [the man PRP.REP really come] ‘Has the man

tightly’) and kekégbe (ólí ómóhé ché' kákégbè ón ólì àgbó [the man PAP.REP perse-
veringly drink the potion] ‘The man again drank the malaria potion with persever-
ance’). che rejects intentional dábo, dóbo and duda.
     Repetitive che precedes temporal kpao and bobo: ólí ómòhè chéè kpáò sé vbì ìwè

     che combines with each quantity preverb except zemi. It allows subject phrases
with right edge high or right edge low tone: ólí ómòhè chéè dóbó óì é ólí émàè [the
man PRP.REP REFL him eat the food] ‘The man has again by himself eaten the food’,
élí ímòhè chéè gbà é ólí émàè [the men PRP.REP COL eat the food] ‘The men have

     In addition, che precedes each manner-demonstrative: ólí ómóhé ché' íná' dín ólí

ólí ómóhé ché' íyó' dín ólí éwè [the man PAP.REP DMD tie the goat] ‘The man again

     Additive aspectualizer gbo occurs with members of each preverb class. With
subject attributive intentional forms except dábo, gbo precedes each: ólí ómòhè gbóò
dóbò é émáé ísì òjè [the man PRP.ADD accidentally eat food ASS Oje] ‘The man acci-
dentally ate Oje's food too’, ólí ómóhé gbó' mítì é ólí émàè léé [the man PAP.ADD

ly ate the food too’ and ólí ómòhè gbóò kpáò é émàè khéé mè [the man PRP.ADD

      gbo also precedes each quantity preverb: zemi (ólí ómóhé gbó' zémì é émàè [the
man PAP.ADD ABSI eat food] ‘The man also ate a lot of food’) and zeze (ólí ómóhé
gbó' zézè é vbí ólí émàè [the man PAP.ADD NABI eat LOC the food] ‘The man also ate
a bit from the food’). As well, gbo allows right edge high or low tone subject with
Emphatic Reflexive dobo (ólí ómòhè gbóò dóbó óì é ólí émàè [the man PRP.ADD REFL

(élí ímòhè gbóò gbà é ólí émàè [the men PRP.ADD COL eat the food] ‘The men have

      Additive gbo precedes each manner-demonstrative: ìná (ólí ómóhé gbó' íná' é ólí

and ìyó (ólí ómóhé gbó' íyó' é ólí émàè [the man PAP.ADD DMD eat the food] ‘The
man also ate the food that way’).
      Punctual aspectualizer ghe appears with members from the four remaining pre-
verb classes. With subject attributives, ghe rejects intentional subclass dóbo, duda
and miti but precedes dábo (ólí ómóhé ghé' dá'bò nwú ólí ómò fí à [the man PAP.PCT

      ghe precedes each temporal preverb: ójé ghé' tùà é ólí émàè [Oje PAP.PCT hur-
riedly eat the food] ‘Oje just hurriedly ate the food’, ójé ghé' kpáò é ólí émàè [Oje

      Relative to quantity preverbs, ghe precedes Emphatic dobó (ólí ómóhé ghé' dóbó
óì é ólí émàè léé [the man PAP.PCT REFL him eat the food TEMP] ‘The man just by
himself finished eating the food’) and Absolute zemi (ólí ómóhé ghé' zémì é ólí émàè

      Punctual ghe precedes manner-demonstratives. It allows ìná (ólí ómóhé ghé' íná'

‘The man just cut the wood that way’).
     Phasal aspectualizer se combines with members of each preverb class. Relative
to subject attitudinal attributives except totóbo and kakégbe, with which it fails, se
precedes dégbe (ólí ómóhé sé' dé'gbè é ólí émàè [the man PAP.DUR steadily eat the
food] ‘The man continued to eat the food steadily’) and gbudu, where it requires
Perfect Negation (ólí ómòhè í ì sé gbùdú è ólí émàè [the man SC NEG DUR coura-
geously eat the food] ‘The man did not continue to eat the food courageously’). se
fails with intentional dábo, dóbo, miti, duda.
     Durative se combines with temporal tua (ólí ómóhé sé' tùà é vbì ólí émàè [the
man PAP.DUR hurriedly eat LOC the food] ‘The man continued to eat from the food
in a hurried fashion’) and kpao (ólí ómóhé sé' kpáò é ólí émàè [the man PAP.DUR
earlier eat the food] ‘The man continued to eat the food earlier on’). se rejects bobo.
     Relative to the quantity class, Durative se appears only with Emphatic dobo (ólí
ómóhé sé' dóbó óì é ólí émàè [the man PAP.DUR REFL him eat the food] ‘The man
continued to eat the food by himself’) and Nonabsolute zeze, the latter requiring
nondeclarative mood (ólí ómòhè séè zèzè bíá vbí ólì òbìà? [the man PRP.DUR NABI
perform LOC the work] ‘Did the man continue to work a bit?’). It fails with gba and
zemi.
     Durative se precedes both proximal and distal manner-demonstrative: ólí ómóhé

ued to push the youth this way’ and ólí ómóhé sé' íyó' súá ólí óvbèkhàn [the man

     Boundary aspectualizers combine with each preverb class, although Conative
òó patterns distinctively. While òó rejects manner-demonstrative ìyó and ìná, it al-

(declarative or imperative) that conditions grammaticality. In declaratives, Ingres-
sive ya is not found with evaluatives (duu, woo, kuku), temporal preverbs (kpao,
bobo, tua) or manner-demonstratives (ìná, ìyó). Relative to subject attributives, In-
gressive ya permits only intentional dóbo (ólí ómòhè yà dóbò é ólí émàè [the man

jects intentional dábo, miti or dúdu, as well as attitudinal gbúdu, dégbe, totóbo and
kakégbe. Regarding quantity preverbs, Ingressive ya rejects gba, zemi or zeze. It
allows only Emphatic dobo (ólí ómòhè yà dóbó óì é ólí émàè [the man PRP.IG REFL
him eat the food] ‘The man almost by himself ate the food’).
     In imperatives, ya combines with each preverb class except evaluative (duu,
woo, kuku). Ingressive precedes only dégbe among attitudinals (yà dégbè é ólí émàè

combines only with tua (yà túá é ólí émàè [IG hurriedly eat the food] ‘Start eating the

Ingressive ya precedes either manner-demonstrative form: ìná (yà íná' é ólí émàè [IG
PMD eat the food] ‘Start eating the food this way’) or ìyó (yà íyó' é ólí émàè [IG DMD

     Past Absolute ya occurs with only two preverb classes. It does not combine with
any of the classes evaluative (duu, woo, kuku), manner-demonstrative (ìná, ìyó) or
subject attributive (dábo, dóbo, miti, duda, gbudu, dégbe, totóbo, kekégbe). Relative
to temporals, Past Absolute ya precedes only kpao (ólí ómóhé yà kpáò bíá vbì òkè

rejects tua and bobo. With quantity preverbs, Past Absolute ya precedes Emphatic

[the man PF he PAP.PA REFL him sell the cloth] ‘It was the man who by himself
used to sell the cloth’). Past Absolute ya fails with gba, zemi and zeze.
     The different functions of mo exhibit contrasting distributional patterns. Egres-
sive mo absolutely restricts co-occurence with other preverb classes: evaluative
(duu, woo, kuku), temporal (kpao, bobo, tua), subject attributive (dábo, dóbo, miti,
dúda, gbúdu, dégbe, totóbo, kakégbe), quantity (dobo, gba, zemi, zeze) and manner
demonstrative (ìná, ìyó).

the classes evaluative (duu, woo, kuku), quantity (dobo, gba, zemi, zeze) and man-

"                           ASP EVAL TEMP MD SA Q3.2.8.1 Preverb repetition
Two Emai preverbs frame one emphatic type. In nonemphatic constructions, either
Additive gbo ‘also/too’ or distal manner-demonstrative ìyó ‘that way’ precede an
otherwise unmodified verb, or a subject attributive or quantity class preverb. In
emphatic frames, gbo or ìyó precedes not only the preverb but also the verb. Em-
phatic iteration never extends to the more event-directed preverb classes aspectual-
izer and evaluative. In complex emphatic structures, gbo tends to precede the verb
and each preverb in the preverbal sequence, or it precedes only selected preverbs.
                                                             Preverb categories | 1613.2.8.2 Distribution of emphatic ìyó
Distal ìyó ‘that way’ occurs in nonemphatic constructions with verb forms as well as
preverbs for quantity, subject attributive, temporal, evaluative or aspectualizer.19
ìyó's position relative to preverb classes is split. It precedes the verb in the absence
of other preverbs. It follows (but never precedes) the classes aspectualizer (gbo),
evaluative (duu) and temporal (kpao). Relative to subject attributive (dégbe, dábo)
and quantity (dobo), ìyó precedes each but never follows either.
     In emphatic constructions, ìyó appears only with the quantity and subject at-
tributive classes. It precedes Emphatic dobo of the quantity class, and it precedes
the verb. In emphatics, ìyó never occurs between the Emphatic Reflexive and the
verb unless it also precedes the Emphatic Reflexive.(103) ólí ómóhé íyó'        dóbó óì íyó' híán ólí óràn.
      the man PAP.DMD REFL him DMD cut the wood
      ‘The man that way by himself cut the wood.’Also in emphatic constructions, ìyó precedes subjective attributives. It precedes
dégbe as well as the verb. Likewise, it precedes both dábo and its verb. No remain-
ing preverb class, aspectualizer, evaluative or temporal, appears in emphatic frames
with ìyó.(104) a. ólí ómóhé íyó'        dé'gbè íyó' híán ólí óràn.

Aspectualizer gbo ‘too, also’ in emphatic frames further articulates relations among
preverb classes. Nonemphatic gbo occurs with verbs as well as quantity, subject
attributive, temporal, and aspectualizer forms. In nonemphatic frames, where no
other preverb is present, gbo precedes the initial verb. It also precedes classes tem-
poral, subject attributive, quantity and manner-demonstrative. gbo thus precedes
each class, except evaluative.
162 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs    In emphatic frames, gbo precedes temporal, subject attributive, and quantity
forms, although never evaluatives, as is also the case with nonemphatic frames.20
gbo occurs with temporal, subject attributive and quantity exponents to reveal the
emphatic schema EVAL / MD gbo Q / SA / TEMP gbo V. gbo appears with quantity
preverbs Emphatic Reflexive dobo and Absolute Intensifier zemi. With each, a copy
of gbo precedes the quantity preverb as well as the verb.(105) a. ólí ómòhè gbóò         dóbó óì gbó é émàè.
         the man PRP.ADD REFL him ADD eat food

         the man PAP.ADD ABSI ADD eat food
         ‘The man really ate a lot of food too.’A similar distribution appears in emphatic constructions with subject attributives. A
copy of gbo precedes subject attributive dégbe and the verb.(106) ólí ómóhé gbó'        dé'gbè gbó é émàè.
      the man PAP.ADD carefully ADD eat food
      ‘The man really carefully ate food too.’Relative to the temporal class in emphatic frames, gbo appears with tua. Their order
is again consistent with quantity and subject attributives: a copy of gbo precedes tua
and the verb. Neither remaining preverb class, evaluative or manner-demonstrative,
appears in gbo emphatic constructions.(107) ólí ómóhé gbó'        tùà        gbó é émàè.
      the man PAP.ADD hurriedly ADD eat food
      ‘The man really ate the food in a hurry.’3.2.8.4 Complex emphatic constructions
A still more complex pattern of emphatic iteration occurs in constructions featuring
gbo and ìyó as well as subject attributive and quantity preverbs. In nonemphatic
frames, a single instance of gbo, following Resultative auxiliary za, precedes man-
ner-demonstrative ìyó, subject attributive dégbe and quantity dobo. gbo never pre-
cedes Resultative za in these constructions.(108) ólí ómóhé zá'         gbò íyó' dé'gbè dóbó óì é émàè.
      the man PAP.RES ADD DMD carefully REFL him eat food
      ‘As a result the man also that way carefully ate food by himself.’

frames employing multiple preverb classes show gbo only in its leftmost preverb
position. Again, temporal and evaluative do not factor in nonemphatic complex
multi-preverb constructions.
    Evaluative and temporal aside, complex emphatic frames show one or more
copies of gbo marking each affected class across the preverb phrase. In one con-
struction gbo precedes the verb, quantity dobo, subject attributive dégbe and man-
ner-demonstrative ìyó.(109) ó gbó'         íyó' gbó dégbè        gbó dóbó óì gbó é émàè.

         Oje PAP.ADD DMD ADD carefully ADD REFL him eat the food
         ‘Oje really that way carefully ate the food by himself.’     In complex emphatic constructions, gbo behavior is consistent with the preverb
order schema: ASP EVAL TEMP MD SA Q. It is ungrammatical for gbo to precede ìyó
and the verb but not dégbe and dobo; precede dégbe and the verb but not dobo and
ìyó; precede ìyó and dobo but not dégbe and the verb; precede ìyó and dobo and the
verb but not dégbe; or precede ìyó, dégbe and the verb but not dobó.
     The distribution facts concerning gbo further refine precedence relations among
preverbs. No two instances of gbo can be separated by a preverb category not
164 | Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbsmarked by gbo and no three instances of gbo can be separated by a preverb category
not marked by gbo. These adjacency relationships in conjunction with preverb co-
occurrence constraints and constraints operating within ìyó emphatic constructions
shape Emai’s preverb schema.","[186, 187, 188, 189, 190]"
"5.8 Relative pronouns
Relative pronouns serve as head of unmarked relative clauses. ébé'/ébí', émé'/émí'
and ólì/élì occupy head position preceding a relative clause complement. No pro-
nominally headed relative clause shows Relator li, as lexically headed relative
clauses do (Chapter 4, 4.3.3.3). Pronominally headed relative clauses are con-
strained by subcategorization type. Only ólì/élì relatives occur across positions de-
fined by basic grammatical relations.5.8.1 ólì / élì relative clausesRelative pronoun ólì/élì occurs as relative clause head. It shows a number contrast
through initial vowel alternation [o ~ e]. Its final vowel elides, as does that of the
definite article with which it is formally identical (Chapter 4, 4.3.1). The pronoun
ólì/élì agrees in number with a corresponding anaphor in the relative clause: singu-
lar ólí with singular nominative pronoun ó and plural élì with plural nominative
pronoun é.(79) a. ólí ó nwú'        émà lí    òjè, ò fí        áwá údò.

        ones they PAP.take yam APP Oje they PAP.hit dog stone
         ‘The ones who gave Oje yam, they hit a dog with a stone.’Relatives signaled by ólì/élì exhibit contrasting reference patterns. Specific refer-
ence is the usual condition, as indicated in the preceding example. Generic refer-
ence, e.g. ‘whoever’ translation, requires Recurrent preverb a in the relative clause.
Singular ólì participates in such constructions, especially when the relative clause
constituent occurs in topic position, whereas élì does not (*élí é á' nwú émà lí òjè, é
fí' ólí áwá údò [ones they PAP.RC take yam APP Oje they PAP.hit the dog stone]

marked relative clauses. They inflect for Past perfect, Habitual imperfect and Predic-
tive prospective. They fail to inflect for Present perfect, imperfect Continuous or
Anticipative prospective.(81) a. òjè húá        íkpùn ní élí é        kúéé'        ólí ómèmè.

tive tense, e.g. unacceptable deontic Hortative í (*òjè ò ó hòò ólí ó í kpàyè óì kpé ìtásà

tions. They appear as matrix subject, possessor (following Associative ísì), direct
object of a simple predicate (záwó ‘see’), direct object of first (rè ‘use’) or second (yé

       ‘As for the one on the road side, she ran into it.’    Within ólì/élì clauses, a full range of grammatical relations relativize. Subject,
possessor and first object grammatical relations relativize, each of which requires in
the relative complement an anaphor corresponding to ólì/élì. Singular subject
anaphor (ó) corresponds to ólí.(86) òjè ré         ólí ó gbé'-ì              sén    émèlá.
     Oje PRP.take one it PAP.be.blunt-F PRP.stab cow
     ‘Oje used the one that is blunt to stab a cow.’In marked and unmarked associative phrases, ísì marked possessor anaphors (e.g.
òí with low high tone) correspond to ólí. However, in the unmarked instance direct
object anaphors (e.g. óì with high low tone) correspond to ólí.(87) a. ákhé ísì ólí má à tà       étá     ísì òí èdèdé gbé'       à.

        pot ASS one one PAP.kill offspring him PRP.break CS
        ‘The pot of the one whose offspring was killed broke.’As first object in double object complements, accusative pronouns (e.g. óí) corre-

     Oje PRP.kill one aleke PAP.hit him stone
     ‘Oje killed the one Aleke hit with a stone.’     When grammatical relations other than subject, possessor and first object rela-
tivize, a zero pronoun (with few exceptions) occurs in the corresponding relative
clause position. For example, when a direct object in a monotransitive complement
relativizes, as in direct object position following de ‘buy,’ a zero pronoun occurs in
the relative complement.(89) a. ólí ójé dé'      vbí óbó ísì ólì òkpòsò dé      ré'.

Emai noun phrases show two conjunction types. The Comitative morpheme bíì con-
joins noun phrases. It induces high tone lowering at the left edge of its following
constituent, provided a high high sequence exists, and its final vowel elides. On the
other hand, Correlative conjunction khi precedes each correlated noun phrase.9 Its
final vowel elides and it induces high tone spread in its immediately following noun
phrase as well as high tone lowering at the left edge of each correlated noun phrase.(105) a. éwè bíì      óókhò vá'ré.

phrases. Lexically headed noun phrases joined by bíì are limited by grammatical
number, animacy, syntactic shape, case and discourse features, while pronominally
headed noun phrases are even more restricted.
    Comitative bíì conjoins two or more lexical noun phrases, although each noun
phrase beyond two requires an instance of bíì.(106) éwè bíì óókhò bíì émèlá bíì            èsí   vá'ré.

         ‘They together went to the house, that is Oje with the farmer.’     In matrix clauses following discourse-defined positions, bíì phrase positions dif-
ferentially restrain pronominal anaphors. Post-bíì anaphors (óí) are obligatory when
co-referring to a noun phrase in focus, topic or antitopic position. Under these con-
ditions, a zero pronoun is unacceptable.(109) a. ònwìmè lí ójé bíì óí gbá'            yé        ìwè.

          they COM farmer PAP.COL move.to house ID be Oje
          ‘He and the farmer together went to the house, that is Oje.’     Noun phrases linked by Comitative bíì restrict agreement regarding animacy,
syntactic shape, and grammatical number. Comitative bíì links names (òlólò bíì òjè
‘Ololo and Oje’), modified nouns (ólí éwè bíì ólí ófè ‘the goat and the rat’) or unmodi-
fied nouns (éwè bíì ófè ‘a goat and a rat’). Comitative bíì links names with modified
nouns (òjè bíì ómóó óí lí ó gbé' ófè [Oje COM friend his R he PAP.kill rat] ‘Oje and his
friend who killed a rat’). Regarding animacy, bíì conjoins animate nouns (ólí éwè bíì
ólí ófè ‘the goat and the rat’) or inanimate nouns (ólí úkpùn bíì ólì òkpàn ‘The cloth
and the gourd’), although human nouns tend to precede nonhuman animate nouns
(ólì òkpòsò bíì ólí áwà ‘the woman and the dog,’ *ólí áwà bíì ólì òkpòsò). However,
Comitative bíì does not conjoin animate and inanimate nouns (*ólì òkpòsò bíì ólí
úkpùn ‘the woman and the cloth’).
     Grammatical number constrains the assignment of pronouns to bíì positions.
Pre-bíì position employs a plural pronoun reflecting the bíì phrase grammatical
relation, although English translation retains a singular or plural interpretation.
Post-bíì position employs an accusative pronoun, irrespective of bíì phrase gram-
matical relation.
     With a bíì phrase as grammatical subject, pre-bíì position takes a plural nomina-
tive pronoun even when the referent is singular.10 Singular nominative pronouns
(e.g. ì ‘I’) are ungrammatical (*ì bíì òjè ‘I and Oje’).(111) mà / vbà / yàn bíì òjè gá             ólì òkpòsò zé.
      we you they COM Oje PRP.meet the woman
      ‘I / You / He and Oje met the woman.’With a bíì phrase as direct object, pre-bíì position requires a plural accusative pro-
noun. The singular direct object form (e.g. mè) is ungrammatical (*mè bíì òjè ‘me
with Oje’).
                                                                   Conjunction | 281(112) ólì òkpòsò gá        màì / vbà / íyàìn bíì òjè zé.
      the woman PRP.meet us      you them COM Oje
      ‘The woman met me / you / him with Oje.’     bíì linked pronominal and lexical forms in matrix grammatical relations interact
with discourse-defined positions. When a pronoun occupies pre-bíì position in ma-
trix subject (yàn bíì ònwìmè gbá yé íwé ísì òjè [they COM farmer PRP.COL move.to
house ASS Oje] ‘He and the farmer together went to Oje's house’), post-bíì anaphors
(e.g. òí) do not correspond to lexical nouns in positions focus li/ni (*ònwìmè lí yán bíì
óí gbá' yé íwé ísì òjè [farmer PF they COM him PAP.COL move.to house ASS Oje] ‘It

óí gbá' yé íwé ísì òjè [the farmer they COM him PAP.COL move.to house ASS Oje] ‘As

íwé ísì òjè, í khì ònwìmè [they COM him PAP.COL move.to house ASS Oje ID be
farmer] ‘He and they together went to Oje’s house, that is the farmer’).
     Under these same lexical conditions, a pre-bíì position anaphor never corre-
sponds to an emphatic pronoun in positions of focus (*ìyàìn lí yán bíì ónwímé gbá' yé
íwé ísì òjè [they PF they COM farmer PAP.COL move.to house ASS Oje] ‘It was he who

íwé ísì òjè, í khì íyàìn [they COM farmer PRP.COL move.to house ASS Oje ID be they]
‘He and the farmer together went to Oje’s house, that is he did’).
     There are additional restrictions on bíì phrases in focus or topic position. In fo-
cus position preceding li/ni, a pre-bíì pronominal must assume an emphatic shape
(màmàì / vbàvbà / ìyàìn bíì òjè ‘we / you / they with Oje’), though not necessarily
plural shape (mèmè / wèwè / ìyòìn bíì òjè ‘I / you / he with Oje’). In contrast, a post-
bíì pronominal in a focus position is constrained. It accepts no accusative pronouns
across first, second or third person singular (*òjè bíì mè / è / óì ‘Oje and me / you /
him’) or plural (*òjè bíì màì / vbà / íyàìn ‘Oje with us / you / them’).
     Conjoined bíì phrases in topic position are more constrained. When a bíì phrase
occurs as topic, a pre-bíì pronominal with emphatic shape is disallowed (*ìyàìn bíì
òjè ‘he and Oje’). Likewise, a bíì phrase in topic position disallows a post-bíì pro-
noun, even if it assumes accusative shape (*òjè bíì mè ‘Oje and me’).","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307]"

3 Inflection, auxiliaries and preverbs
Emai inflection, auxiliary and preverb categories follow the grammatical subject
phrase and precede the initial verb of the predicate phrase. Inflection consists of
affirmative and negative aspect categories. They precede the auxiliary categories of
modality and relative tense, in that order. Preverbs follow auxiliaries.","[124, 125]"

killed the rat, that is the man’) and information questions (*kí óé' ó gbé' ólí ófè ò [SN
who he PAP.kill the rat INT] ‘It surely wasn’t the case who killed the rat’).
     The remaining construction types, all of which show a discourse defined posi-
tion, exhibit varying degrees of compatibility. Information questions are the most
severely restricted.
     Topic position combines with positive focus, negative focus and direct ques-
tions. It fails with right dislocation. No matter the other construction, the topic con-
stituent appears in leftmost position (*ólí ómòhè lí ólí ófè, ó gbé' óì [the man PF the
rat he PAP.kill it] ‘It was the man, as for the rat, who killed it’). When topic and posi-
tive focus position co-occur, topic precedes the li/ni marked focus constituent.(159) a. ólí ófè, ólí ómòhè lí ó gbé'           óì.
         the rat the man PF he PAP.kill it
         ‘As for the rat, it was the man who killed it.’
      b. ólí ómòhè, ólí ófè lí ó gbé'-ì.
         the man       the rat PF it PAP.kill-F
         ‘As for the man, it was the rat he killed.’A single constituent is never referenced in both topic and focus position (*ólí ófè,
íyòìn lí ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [the rat he PF the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for the rat, it was he
who the man killed’).
     When topic and negative focus both occur, topic precedes the negative focus
noun phrase, never the reverse (*ólí ómòhè kí ólí ófè, ó gbé' óì [the man NF the rat he
PAP.kill it] ‘It wasn’t the man, as for the rat, who killed it’).(160) ólí ófè, ólí ómòhè kí ó gbé'         óì.
      the rat the man NF he PAP.kill it
      ‘As for the rat, it wasn't the man who killed it.’A single noun phrase is never the referent of topic and negative focus position (*ólí
ófè, íyòìn kí ólí ómóhé gbé' óì [the rat he NF the man PAP.kill it] ‘As for the rat, it
wasn’t he who the man killed’).
     When topic and information question frames co-occur, topic precedes the ques-
tion word (*ébé' ólí ómòhè, ó' yé? [where the man he PAP.move.to] ‘Where, as for the
man, did he move to?’, *émé' ólí ómòhè, ó ré' híán ólí óràn? [what the man he
PAP.use cut the wood] ‘What, as for the man, did he use to cut the wood?’).(161) a. ólí ómòhè, ébé' ó yé'-ì?
         the man      where he PAP.move.to-F
         ‘As for the man, where did he move to?’
416 | Noncanonical constructions      b. ólí ómòhè, émé' ó ré'           híán ólí óràn?
         the man      what he PAP.use cut the wood
         ‘As for the man, what did he use to cut the wood?’When a topic constituent corresponds to a grammatical relation in an embedded S-
complement of an information question, topic precedes interrogative pronoun
(*émé' ó zé-í' ólí ómòhè, khì ò híán ólí óràn? [what it PAP.cause-F the man IND he
PRP.cut the wood] ‘Why, as for the man, did he cut the wood?’, *émé' ó zé-í' khí ólí
ómòhè, khì ò híán ólí óràn? [what it PAP.cause-F IND the man IND he PRP.cut the
wood] ‘Why, as for the man, did he cut the wood?’).(162) ólí ómòhè, émé' ó zé-í'            khì ò híán ólí óràn?
      the man what it PAP.cause-F IND he PRP.cut the wood
      ‘As for the man, why did he cut the wood?’     Topic and right dislocation are incompatible, even when each position corre-
sponds to a distinct grammatical relation in the matrix clause (*ólí ómòhè, ò shén óì,
í khì ólí úkpùn [the man he PRP.sell it ID be the cloth] ‘As for the man, he sold it, that
is the cloth’).
     Positive focus shows extremely limited compatibility with other construction
types. It co-occurs with topic, as already indicated, and right dislocation but not
with negative focus and information questions.
     Positive focus and right dislocation are compatible, although crossover of
grammatical relations constrains grammatical acceptability. When matrix grammat-
ical subject corresponds to positive focus, matrix direct object in a monotransitive
complement can correspond to a right dislocated constituent. However, a direct
object in a monotransitive complement that corresponds to a focus position noun
phrase never co-occurs with a subject that corresponds to a constituent in RD posi-
tion (*ólí úkpùn lí ó shén'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the cloth PF he PAP.sell-F ID be the man]
‘It was the cloth that he sold, that is the man’, *ólí ófè lí ó gbé'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the
rat PF he PAP.kill-F ID be the man] ‘It was the rat that he killed, that is the man’).(163) a. ólí ómòhè lí ó shén'         óì, í khì ólí úkpùn.
         the man PF he PAP.sell it ID be the cloth
         ‘It was the man who sold it, that is the cloth.’
      b. ólí ómòhè lí ó gbé'          óì, í khì ólí ófè.
         the man PF he PAP.kill it ID be the rat
         ‘It was the man who killed it, that is the rat.’   Positive focus never co-occurs with information questions. Even when distinct
grammatical relations are affected, focus and direct question are incompatible

that it was the man who moved?’, *ólí ómòhè lí ébé' ó yé'-ì? [the man PF where he
PAP.move.to-F] ‘It was the man who to where did he move?’).
     Negative focus also shows limited co-occurrence with other construction types.
It appears with topic, as already seen, and right dislocation, but not with positive
focus or direct questions. Negative focus and right dislocation are compatible, alt-
hough crossover of grammatical relations in the matrix clause limits combinations.
Subject corresponds to a constituent in negative focus position when a direct object
corresponds to right dislocated position.(164) a. ólí ómòhè kí ó shén'          óì, í khì ólí úkpùn.
         the man NF he PAP.sell it ID be the cloth
         ‘It was the man who sold it, that is the cloth.’
      b. ólí ómòhè kí ó gbé'           óì, í khì ólí ófè.
         the man NF he PAP.kill it ID be the rat
         ‘It was the man who killed it, that is the rat.’But a direct object that corresponds to negative focus position never co-occurs with
a subject that corresponds to right dislocated position (*ólí úkpùn kí ó shén'-ì, í khì ólí
ómòhè [the cloth NF he PAP.sell-F ID be the man] ‘It wasn’t the cloth that he sold,
that is the man’, *ólí ófè kí ó gbé'-ì, í khì ólí ómòhè [the rat NF he PAP.kill-F ID be the
man] ‘It wasn’t the rat that he killed, that is the man’).
     Negative focus never co-occurs with information questions. Even with distinct
grammatical relations affected, NF and questions are incompatible (*ébé' ólí ómòhè
kí ó yé'-ì? [where the man NF he PAP.move.to-F] ‘Where if it wasn’t the man did he
go to?’, *ólí ómòhè kí ébé' ó yé'-ì? [the man NF where he PAP.move.to-F] ‘It wasn’t
the man so where did he move to?’).
     As indicated previously, right dislocation co-occurs with positive focus, nega-
tive focus and with information questions. It never combines with topicalization. RD
and information questions are compatible provided distinct matrix relations are
involved. Moreover, crossover of subject to right dislocated position and direct ob-
ject to question position is acceptable.(165) émé' ó shén'-ì,       í khì ólí ómòhè?
      what he PAP.sell-F ID be the man
      ‘What did he sell, that is the man?’In addition, the constraint limiting RD to subject or direct object does not apply
under a question condition. Indirect objects marked by Applicative li/ni appear in
RD position with question words corresponding to subject or direct object.

"3.2.8 Preverb order and emphatic constructionsAdditional support for order relations among preverb classes is discernable in em-
phatic constructions, which characterize narrative discourse. Aspectualizer gbo and
manner-demonstrative ìyó frame an order schema. Preverb distribution in these
constructions reflects a scale. One end has the more event-directed classes aspectu-
alizer (ASP), evaluative (EVAL) and temporal (TEMP); the other end has the partici-
pant-directed quantity (Q) class. Between are subject attributive (SA) and manner-
demonstrative (MD). Using this scale, preverbs more event-directed, e.g. aspectual-
izers, precede those more participant-directed, e.g. quantity.",[186]

Emai exhibits lexical items that reflect contact with various ethnic groups and their
languages in the relatively recent past. As well, some of these lexemes might reflect
a common historical past. For the moment, we do not pursue this historical matter.
Borrowed lexemes derive from English, Yoruba, Hausa and Igbo, among other lan-
guages. Most borrowed forms are nouns for concrete or highly abstract objects.
Verbs tend not to be borrowed.
    Lexemes that appear borrowed from English denote artifacts, food, locations
and abstractions. Many refer to referents from an English colonial era that persisted
from the 1890s to the 1960s.","[112, 113]"
