"9.1.4 Restriction and elaboration of referenceThere is little evidence of syntactic complexity in nominal groups. Reference is
elaborated or restricted by juxtaposing nominals and simple clauses and not by,
for example, the use of embedded relative clauses.⁸⁴
     Participial clauses associated with simultaneous actions can, however,
provide more information about what a referent is doing (§7.5.4). In (9.24), the
participial clause langankina kingkarri ‘hanging up’ provides further information
about what the boy (the subject of the main clause) is doing. In (9.25), the par-
ticipial clause dajkurri jibarri kulaji kundana ‘hitting the woman’s head with a
84 This is consistent with Hale (1976)’s characterization of NP-relative “adjoined relative”
clauses in Australian languages, which typically occur at the periphery of clauses.

stick’ provides further information about what the man (the object of the main
clause) is doing.(9.24)    najba ngana       juka-wanyi langa-nkina kingkarri
          see     1sgacc boy-erg            hang-ss         up
          ‘That boy, hanging up (in a tree), sees me/ That boy sees me, (while he
          is) hanging up (in a tree).’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 6.2.2.1, my transla-
          tion)(9.25)    najba      ngay=i           nganinyi da-jkurri jibarri
          see        1sgnom=past      man        hit-ds       woman
          kulaji kunda-na banda-na
          head       stick-loc camp-loc
          ‘I saw the man (while he was) hitting the woman on the head with a
          stick at the camp.’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 6.2.1.9)The nominalizing suffix -warr (§7.6.2) can also elaborate a reference. Here, it elab-
orates on a referent’s characteristic. Note that the object nouns of the nominal-
ized verb are marked with dative morphology. The translations given in Furby and
Furby (1977) represent (9.26) and (9.27) as verbless sentences (see §9.2 below), but
we can conceivably represent these as elaborated noun phrases in translation.
Therefore, I put the copula in parentheses in the translation line. It should be
noted, however, that speakers rarely use such constructions and are more likely
to elaborate reference by juxtaposing clauses.(9.26)    nayinda juka ngaki          kudukudu-nyi kaku-nyi wadamba-warr
          this        boy 1sgdat many-dat            fish-dat feed-char
          ‘This (is) my boy who eats many fish.’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 6.3.4)(9.27)    ngurrumba-warr      muwada-nyi      nanda      walungkanarra
          sink-char           boat-dat        that       sea.creature
          ‘That sea creature (is) one who sinks boats.’ (Furby and Furby 1977:
          6.3.1)As noted in §8.3.4, the conjunction jala/jali ‘relative’ is used to indicate relative
times of actions. In (9.28), which is from Belfrage’s field notes, the sentence is
translated with an English relative clause, but the corresponding Garrwa does not
support this rendering.
262         Syntax(9.28)     daba=yi     juka-wanyi nanda bajangu jal=i                bijba
           hit=past    boy-erg        that    dog       rel=past bite
           ‘The boy hit the dog that bit him.’ (=The boy hit the dog when it bit
           him) (Belfrage 1991 field notes)9.2 Verbless sentencesAs noted above, constructions readily translated as English equative sentences
can be formed by collocating nominals, including demonstratives and posses-
sive pronouns. Depending on the context, these constructions may also be inter-
preted as nominal groups. It is, therefore, unclear whether these can be analysed
as predicative constructions in and of themselves. The following examples from
Ken Hale’s 1962 field notes have a demonstrative–possessive pronoun–nominal
structure, but note the possibilities for rendering them into English.(9.29)     nayinda nganyi         bajangu
           this        2sgdat     dog
           ‘This dog is yours.’ (Hale 1962 field notes)(9.30)     nayinda       nanga-ngi     bajangu
           this          3sg-dat       dog
           ‘This is his/her dog.’ (Hale 1962 field notes)In the absence of a copula or any other predicate-marking form, it is difficult to
determine out of context what is being predicated of what. Note, for example,
that the ordering of words in such constructions does not always clearly match
the translated English equative construction.⁸⁵ In example (9.31), which has a
demonstrative–possessive pronoun–noun order, the Garrwa does match the
English, but, in example (9.32) the possessive pronoun nganyi occurs first and is
followed by a demonstrative and a noun.(9.31)     nanda       ngaki          bilikinya
           that        1sgdat         yZD
           ‘That’s my niece.’ (lit. ‘that one my niece’) (7.8.03.1.ER)
85 These are the translations provided by Garrwa language consultants.

          ‘This is a big flood / This big flood.’ (4.5.01.5.KS)In naming contexts, the newly introduced name occurs initially. This is consist-
ent with the general practice of putting the most prominent information in initial
position.(9.35)    burrulin      kulunganja nanga-ngi          wanbul-anyi
          tadpole       daughter      3sg-dat         frog-dat

          baby       3sgnom=past small
          ‘Baby, he (KS’s oldest child) was small (i.e., a toddler).’ (4.5.01.5.KS)(9.38)    ngaki     wulukanja nanda bula            bayakada-wuya barri
          1sgdat father          that     3dunom small-du               pi
          ‘My father (and his brother), those two were small.’ (16.5.00.1.KS)9.3 Simple sentencesMany Australian languages are described as having free word order in the sense
that their syntactic functions (e.g., subject and object) are not signalled by word
order as they are in English, and that there is no fixed orders in phrase-like units.
Garrwa is like other Australian languages in this regard. However, as this section
264          Syntaxshows, there are clear patterns of ordering – some are syntactic based and some
are pragmatically based.
    A sentence can minimally include a verb plus a TAM clitic, but only when
there is an established third person subject referent (which (9.39) illustrates) or
in imperative contexts. For all other persons and numbers, a pronoun must also
be used (which (9.40) and (9.41) illustrate). The verb-TAM clitic-pronoun combi-
nation thus forms the core of a Garrwa sentence. Nominal groups that represent
the core arguments of predicates (verbs) are not grammatically obligatory and
frequently occur in intonation units following the core (see below). Adjuncts tend
to occur at the periphery of the sentence, usually finally, and often in a separate
intonation unit.
    The canonical word order in simple sentences can be represented by the fol-
lowing template:      (conjunction) – (adjunct) – Core {comprising initial and second positions} – (core argument
      nominal group) – (adjuncts).","[278, 279, 280, 281, 282]"

"3.1 Morphosyntactic typologyGarrwa is and has been spoken in a linguistically diverse region of Australia. The
language families with which Garrwa people have had considerable sustained
contact include the non-Pama-Nyungan Mirndi (largely Gudanji and Wambaya)
and Tangkic (Ganggaliida) families, as well as the Pama-Nyungan Waluwarric
(Yanyuwa) family. As noted in Chapter 1, there has been considerable debate
about whether the Garrwan language family (Garrwa and Waanyi) belongs to the
Pama-Nyungan or the Non-Pama-Nyungan language family. Whatever its genetic
and contact history, Garrwa morphology and syntax demonstrate a number of
typologically unusual, as well as typologically regular, features for an Australian
language.
     Like all of its surrounding languages (except Yanyuwa¹⁴), Garrwa is a suf-
fixing-only language. Also like many Australian languages, it is highly agglu-
tinative, with each morpheme clearly following another. While there are some
morphosyntactic processes associated with the combination of morphemes, the
forms of morphemes are transparent in words. We see this in (3.1) – an instru-
mental construction that comprises the noun comitative suffix -yudi and the erga-
tive suffix -nyi; (3.2) – a directional form, the locative suffix -rri, and the locational
suffix -nbana (which means ‘on the side of a landmark feature’ (e.g., a river)); and
14 Yanyuwa itself is somewhat unusual for a Pama-Nyungan language because it has both
prefixes and suffixes.
34         Grammatical overview(3.3) – an ablative pronoun that comprises a pronominal root, the locative suffix
-ndu, and the ablative suffix -nanyi.(3.1)       wabuda-yudi-nyi
            water-with-erg
            ‘with water’ (e.g., sprinkle a fire with water)(3.2)       bayanga-rri-nbana
            west-loc-side2
            ‘on the west side’(3.3)       nganyi-ndu-nanyi
            2sg-loc-abl
            ‘(away) from you’Like most suffixing languages in Australia, Garrwa is largely dependent marking:
regular case-marking is required on nominals, including pronouns and demon-
stratives, to indicate grammatical function. Verbal inflectional morphology is
limited to a set of participial suffixes: there is no verb agreement and no verb-
specific tense/aspect/mood morphology (see §3.3 below).
    Also, like many Australian languages, core grammatical relations (subject and
object) follow a “split ergative” pattern (Dixon 1994), where all nouns (including
proper nouns) and demonstratives follow an ergative/absolutive pattern and all
pronouns follow a nominative/accusative pattern,¹⁵ which (3.4) illustrates.(3.4)       a.      jawunja=yi nganinyi jibarri-wanyi
                    kiss=past    man       woman-erg
                    ‘The woman kissed the man.’            b.      jawunja ngay=i                  nganinyi
                    kiss        1sgnom=past         man
                    ‘I kissed the man.’            c.      jawunja ngan=i        nganinyi-wanyi
                    kiss     1sgacc=past man-erg
                    ‘The man kissed me.’
15 The category absolutive is not overtly coded in the glosses for nominals. Ergative, nomina-
tive, and accusative are all overtly coded in the gloss line.
                                                          Morphosyntactic typology           35
Other relations are signalled by non-core case-marking with dative, locative, and
directional suffixes.(3.5)       a.      kuyu     ngay=i           mama,          wawarra-nyi
                    bring    1sgnom=past food                child-dat
                    ‘I brought food for the kids.’            b.      jawunja ngay=i            nganinyi, barawu-na
                    kiss       1sgnom=past man          house-loc
                    ‘I kissed the man in the house.’            c.      kuyu     ngay=i           mama,            banda-rri
                    bring    1sgnom=past food                  camp-all
                    ‘I brought food to the camp.’Garrwa syntax is built around a second-position clitic complex that minimally
includes a pronoun or a tense, aspect, or modal marker, although it mostly
includes both. The second-position pronoun can only mark the subject (nomina-
tive pronoun), the object (accusative pronoun), or both the subject and the object
(human referents only). This is illustrated in (3.6). Oblique pronominal arguments
never occur in second position.¹⁶(3.6)       a.      kuyu     ngay=i            mama
                    bring    1sgnom=past food
                    ‘I brought food.’ (subject pronoun and tense marking in second
                    position)            b.      kuyu    ngan=i          Mukularrangu-rri
                    bring 1sgacc=past Robinson.River-all
                    ‘He brought me to Robinson River.’ (object pronoun and tense
                    marking in second position)
16 Second-position pronouns are conventionally written as separate words even though they
are usually prosodically dependent on the initial word and are thus better analysed as clitics.
This convention has arisen in part because of speakers’ treatment of pronouns as independ-
ent words, and in part because these pronouns can occur elsewhere in clauses and in contexts
where they are clearly not cliticized (e.g., in utterance-initial position).

                  position)The positioning of basic grammatical information in second position, such as
person, number, and grammatical relations of core arguments, as well as tense,
aspect, and modal information, is an areal feature of north-central Australia
that includes Garrwa and some languages to its south and west (Mushin 2005c;
Mushin 2006). For example, similar structures are found in some Ngumpin-
Yapa (e.g., Warlpiri and Gurindji), Tangkic (e.g., Ganggaliida), and Mirndi (e.g.,
Wambaya) languages. Waanyi pronouns appear to behave similarly to Garrwa,
but Waanyi does not have tense or aspect marking in this position as Garrwa does.
The Garrwa second-position system differs from others in the region because it a)
lacks an auxiliary or catalyst element (cf. Warlpiri and Gurindji), b) lacks a clear
distinction between free and bound pronoun paradigms (cf. all other Australian
languages with second-position clitics), and c) shows variation in the placement
of pronouns and tense, aspect, and modal markers (cf. Warlpiri and Wambaya
where the order is fixed). Further properties of the Garrwa second-position clitics
are discussed in §5.7 (second person pronouns), §8.1 (tense, aspect, and modal
clitics), and §9.3 (syntax).
     As shown in the examples above, the verb is the default word class that occurs
in the initial position that precedes the second-position clitic complex. However,
as discussed in detail in Chapter 9, if there is a motivation for marking a word as
prominent (or focused), then that word is found in immediate initial position and
the verb occurs immediately after the second-position complex. This is illustrated
in (3.7) with a question-and-answer pair from a narrative text. The question word
occurs initially in the question, while the information that answers the question
is also found in initial position.(3.7)     a.      wanya ninji      najba juka kukulinya
                  what    2sgnom see        boy   DaCh(of woman)
                  ‘What are you looking at grandson?’
                                                                        Word classes    37
            b.      nganbi-nyi      ngayu       yadajba kukudi, darrumala-nyi
                    lilyroot-dat 1sgnom wait               MoMo       lilyroot-dat
                    ‘I’m waiting for lilyroots, granny, lilyroots.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)Therefore, Garrwa verbs occur either clause initially and thus host the second-
position clitic, or they occur initially among the linguistic elements that occur
after the second position. These properties have led to the analysis that Garrwa
has a verb-initial basic word order.¹⁷ The word order properties in Garrwa are thus
less free than how many other Australian languages have been described. Some
ordered structures can be attributed to a highly systematic use of word order to
mark particular pragmatic profiles (see §9.4 for more details), while others (e.g.,
the ordering of nominal arguments and adjuncts when following the second posi-
tion) appear more grammatically motivated.
     In the next section, I summarize the key morphosyntactic properties of
Garrwa word classes.","[51, 52, 53, 54, 55]"

                  place.name (15.10.03.1)10.2.5 Mili ‘intensifier’This particle/clitic is used in a range of ways, all of which indicate an intensifica-
tion of that which is under its scope. Speakers frequently translate it as ‘more’,
although it does not seem to have the same range of meanings as the English
“more”. For events, it can mean that the event is done repeatedly. Mili is mostly
found in second position and so may be loosely cliticized to the preceding word
as other second-position phenomena are. In the second position, mili appears to
occur after all other possible clitics (TA and pronouns). In (10.30), it occurs after
the TAM clitic =(y)ili; in (10.31), it occurs after both the TA clitic and the following
accusative pronoun; in (10.32) and (10.33), it directly follows the pronoun.(10.30)    bak=ili     mili      jurrulaba  wayka
           and=hab intens dive              down
           ‘And she would again jump back down in the water.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)(10.31)    ngarrkadaba=yi      bula-nya       mili           nana-nkurri

           ‘He speared at them again.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)Mili is frequently used in contexts of emphasis and contrast. In (10.32) and (10.33)
below, mili occurs following the use of the third person singular pronoun nyulu, a
pronoun which is only used in context of emphasis or contrast (§4.1).(10.32)    nyul=i           mili       jilajba nana-nkurri-wa

           They (the policemen) were on horses.’ (Porch.narrative. 2003.KS)(10.35)    nurru          mili       jila=yi         kula  kujba=ya

           ‘We went south again, we were looking for (him), my dad (in contrast
           with what others were doing).’ (3.9.03.3.KS)In negative contexts, mili emphasizes the negativity, often in contexts of disa-
greement or contradiction. In (10.36), which is from a conversation, the speaker
emphasizes the fact that she can’t dance. Thus, she can’t participate in a cere-
mony that others might participate in.(10.36)    miku ngayi=yi          mili     kajurra, balkijba ngayu
           neg      1sgnom=yi intens       dance     be.bad     1sgnom

           knee olden.times-still
           ‘I really can’t dance – my knee has been bad for a long time still.’
           (20.6.08.DG)In (10.37), which is from a conversation, the speaker is disputing a claim made
by another speaker on how people used to eat waterlily seeds. The use of mili
emphasizes the disagreement (translated here with ‘really’). Note that these three
conversational uses of mili in (10.36) and (10.37) illustrate mili in three different
places in the clause. In (10.36), mili immediately follows the pronoun and TAM
clitic. In (10.37), mili occurs (1) straight after the negative particle and before the
322       Discourse phenomenapronoun in second position, and (2) after the verb, which is in a post-core posi-
tion.(10.37)   ngala    miku mili        yali-yanyi,   miku yali-yanyi       jarrba
          contr neg intens 3plnom-neg neg               3plnom-neg eat

          intens like.this old.woman grind 3plnom
          ‘But – no they really didn‘t. They really didn‘t eat it like that, old
          woman. They’d grind it.’ (3.9.03.4.DG)10.3 SummaryThis chapter focuses on word order, particles and their contribution to discourse
organization in Garrwa. Some features of turn management in conversation,
such as overlapping talk and the use of silence, are examined in other work (e.g.,
Gardner and Mushin 2007; Mushin and Gardner 2009; Mushin and Gardner 2010).
The range of particles examined here show much that is common across Austral-
ian languages and languages in general, but also much that may be unique to
Garrwa. For example, while the prior information particle barri shares features
with a related particle in Yanyuwa, they are clearly not synonymous. As noted in
the introduction to this chapter, any analysis of discourse phenomena is incom-
plete without a proper understanding of the use of prosody. Such as study must
be left for future work, however.

My introduction to Garrwa began in 1999 when I embarked on the Austral-
ian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS) funded
“Garrwa Language Project” in conjunction with members of the Borroloola Lan-
guage Centre. In the first phase of the project, I conducted fieldwork in Borroloola
in November 1999 and March-June 2000 to produce a 325-word picture diction-
ary and a non-technical grammatical sketch to facilitate the Garrwa language
program. These materials were published in house to be available for developing
teaching materials. A number of mostly narrative texts were also audio recorded
at this time and compiled as an in-house text collection.
     I was able to continue working on Garrwa in 2001 through a University of
Sydney postdoctroral fellowship entitled “Language loss and the linguistics of
storytelling in Aboriginal Australia”. The focus of this project was on language
use in narrative discourse. I conducted field trips in May 2001 and August-October
2003 that concentrated on the recording and transcription of narrative and con-
versational data with elicitation of particular linguistic features a secondary goal.
Publications that emerged from this narrative-focused project include Mushin
(2005a), Mushin (2005b), Mushin (2006), Simpson & Mushin (2008), and Mushin
& Simpson (2008). More conversational data was collected and transcribed in
field trips in November 2006 and June 2008, which was supported by AIATSIS
“Garrwa Language Project, Phase 2” and a University of Queensland Staff grant.
     In writing this grammar, I have tried to balance the interests of both Garrwa
people and linguists. Garrwa people may want to use this book as a resource for
how to say things in Garrwa or to provide tools for language maintenance and
revitalisazation in the future. They may also like to have a document that dem-
onstrates the uniqueness of their language. Linguists may be interested in the
grammatical features of Garrwa for a range of theoretical issues.
     My own interests have been in developing a description of the language as it
is used by its speakers. Consequently, the focus of this grammar is on the kinds of
utterances that speakers employ in actual discourse, and it takes advantage of the
considerable corpus of Garrwa discourse recorded between 1999 and 2010, which
is supplemented with field notes and recordings of other linguists and anthro-
pologists who have worked on Garrwa. I focus less on structures that, though they
may be elicited under certain conditions, are seldom used. Where possible, I try
to link my description of the structural features of Garrwa to the ways in which
such structures are used in discourse, especially ordinary conversation.
     While many Garrwa speakers have contributed to this project, I have been
fortunate to have had sustained language teaching, transcription, and transla-
tion assistance from †Doreen George, †Kathleen Shadforth, and Thelma Dixon.
viii      Preface and acknowledgementsThese three women, all born and raised in Robinson River, have contributed
the bulk of the discourse and grammatical data used for this description. Other
significant contributors include Eileen and †Don Rory, †Dinny McDinny, Nancy
McDinny, Myra McDinny, Hazel Godfrey, and Miriam Charlie.
     A considerable number of other people have also helped with this project.
I particularly want to thank Rebecca Green who first alerted me to the Garrwa
people’s interest in having a linguist work on their language. I am very grateful
for the ongoing support of the original Borroloola Language Centre and particu-
larly their director Maryanne Riley. Karan Hayward has adminstered the AIATSIS
grant on behalf of Papalu-Apparr Kari Aboriginal Corporation in Tennant Creek.
In Borroloola, I have also had the support of Peter Callinan, co-ordinator of the
Waralungku Arts Centre, and Mike Longton. My trips to Robinson River were
helped by the support of Council co-ordinator Bill South and Helen Webber,
former principal of the Robinson River School. I also am grateful for the intel-
lectual support, advice, and constructive criticism from Brett Baker, Rod Gardner,
Mark Harvey, Mary Laughren, Rachel Nordlinger, Patrick McConvell, Felicity
Meakins, Rob Pensalfini, Jane Simpson, and Robert Van Valin.
     Thanks go to Adam LeBrocq, Ruby Rayner, and Paul Sidwell for editorial
support. The Map was produced by the Cartographic section of Education and
Multimedia Services, Australian National University.
     My family, both near and extended, have been a constant source of love and
support and are a major reason this book has been completed.

Map of Garrwa and surrounding languages.
1 The Garrwa language and its speakers1.1 Garrwa country and contact historyGarrwa language territory extends roughly from the eastern bank of the Macarthur
River at Borroloola in the Northern Territory southeast to just over the Queens-
land Border towards the ex-mission settlement of Doomadgee and the Nichol-
son River. Traditionally, Garrwa country did not include the coastline along the
Gulf of Carpentaria, although Garrwa people today do affiliate with the area at
the mouths of the major rivers that extend south of the Gulf of Carpentaria: the
Wearyan, Folsche, and Robinson rivers. Most maps that show Aboriginal lan-
guage territory have Garrwa extending south as far as the ends of the rivers that
flow from the Gulf of Carpentaria. The surviving surrounding language groups
include Yanyuwa (a coastal group to the north and west), Waanyi (to the south),
Gudanji (also to the south), and Ganggalida (to the east). Two other neighbouring
groups, Binbinka and Wilangarra, had disappeared shortly after European settle-
ment and there are no records of their languages. The approximate boundaries of
these language areas are represented on the map, which is based on the maps in
Harvey (2009).
     Pickering (1992: 11), in his study of traditional Western Garrwa hunting prac-
tices, describes their environment as a “transitional zone between the northern
subhumid to humid tropics and the southern central semi-arid to arid inland…
centre[ing] on the major north-south running river and stream systems of the Gulf
fall, with seasonal excursions into the hills of the Bukalara/Barkly Plateau, and
onto the plains of the Gulf fall”. These major north-south rivers include (from west
to east), the Wearyan, Folsche, Robinson, and Calvert Rivers, as well as Settle-
ment Creek (at Wollogorang). Additionally, there are many freshwater billabongs
(or lagoons) that become expansive lakes in the wet season. Thus, Garrwa culture
developed in an environment that was neither coastal nor arid between the Gulf
of Carpentaria coastline and the vast Barkly Tableland to the south. Towards the
coast, the rivers become esturine and open out into mangrove swamps, while
inland the country becomes stony with sandstone gorges and escarpments. There
are many caves in this area that were used as shelter in the wet season.
     Garrwa people call themselves freshwater people who exploit the bounties of
these river systems and billabongs: freshwater fish, crayfish, turtles, waterfowl,
and waterlilies were staple parts of a diet that also consisted of land mammals
(kangaroo, echidna, and possums), tubers, and fruit. Pickering (1989: 12)
describes Garrwa land use as seasonal but traditionally people moved around in
no more than a radius of about 15 kilometres to take advantage of the food avail-
2       The Garrwa language and its speakersable at different times of the year. The climate is governed by a tropical wet-dry
cycle. The long wet season would result in a dispersal of population because there
were many sources of water and food. As the land dried up over the dry season,
people would cluster around the permanent water supplies of the major rivers.
Trigger (1987b) shows how Garrwa material culture (including manufacture of
spear throwers and stone tools) distinguishes them from their coastal Saltwater
neighbours to the north and east.
    The first Europeans to enter Garrwa country would most likely have been the
exploratory parties headed by Ludwig Leichhardt in 1844 and 1845 that travelled
from the east coast of Australia to approximately where Darwin is today, from
the Great Dividing Range across the Gulf of Carpentariacoastline. While there is
no specific reference to Garrwa people in the journals of this expedition, there is
clear recognition of the presence of a people living in Garrwa country. Roberts
(2005: 9), in his early contact history about the Gulf of Carpentaria region (includ-
ing Garrwa country), relates what Leichhart recorded:    In the vicinity of what is now the Robinson and Wearyan rivers he described emu traps
    around waterholes, fish traps and fishing weirs across rivers, well-used footpaths, major
    living areas with substantial dwellings, wells of clear water and a sophisticated method of
    detoxifying the otherwise extremely poisonous cycad nuts.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

            ‘Tell us how you all were.’ (16.5.00.1.KS)9.3.2 Status of second-position pronouns in the coreI describe second position in the core as one position even though there is some
variation in where some TA clitics attach in this clausal position. Aside from the
past clitic =yi, which Mushin (2008) argues shows signs of becoming a verbal
inflection, the TAM and pronominal elements of the second position cannot be
split by other clausal elements (e.g., nominal groups or parts thereof, adjuncts),
and they are found within the same intonation unit. This is evidence that speak-
ers do treat TAM+pronoun clusters as a syntactic unit whatever their morphologi-
cal properties.
     As noted in §5.7, there are good reasons to analyse Garrwa second-position
pronouns as clitics. Garrwa second-position pronouns have many phonological
properties of clitics: they are unstressed and sometimes reduced. While they can
occur utterance initially under marked pragmatics conditions, such as contrast
or emphasis, these contexts are infrequent in discourse. In clauses with more
than one (non-compounded) pronoun (e.g., representing core and oblique argu-
ments), it is highly unusual for the pronouns to be discontinuous. In most cases,
the order is subject-pronoun and then object or oblique pronoun.
     However, unlike the modal clitics, which can never occur outside of second
position, pronouns are written as independent words in this grammar to take
account of their capacity to occur in other positions in the clause according to
their pragmatic and semantic roles.⁸⁸ Other Australian languages that have estab-
lished clitic pronouns (sometimes in second position and sometimes elsewhere)
tend to have alternate or different forms for their free pronouns. This is not the
case for Garrwa. Whether in second position or elsewhere, the pronouns have the
same forms, and these forms are the basis for regular case marking because other
nominals are case-marked (although there are particular case allomorphs for pro-
nouns – see §5.2). Certainly, speakers do not consider second-position pronouns
to differ from pronouns found elsewhere in the clause.","[284, 285]"

9.6.3 Clause chainsNormally, each independent clause must have some kind of tense/aspect
marking: past tense for past time contexts, future for future time contexts, and
past habitual for events that happened regularly in the past. Present tense is only
marked in third person (singular) contexts. The extract in (9.163), which is from a
story about the coming of white people to Garrwa country, illustrates the consist-
ent use of tense/aspect marking in narrative texts. In this text, past habitual is
                                                                  Complex sentences           297
used to represent these events as regular features of the Garrwa history. Note also
that each clause has the object pronoun yalunya.¹⁰⁰(9.163)     a.       rangimba=kili    yalu-nya    darrayaki-wanyi

                     (15.5.00.1.DR)Similarly, (9.164), which is from a traditional narrative, most of the clauses of nar-
ration are in past tense.(9.164)     birijba=yi      nanda       yunkurr, birijba=yi      janja,
            sing=past       that        wind       sing=past     rain

            water-all       down
            ‘He sang that wind. He sang the rain. The wind came from the east, rain.
            It broke (that) branch and he fell down into the water.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)
100 See Mushin (2005b) for more on clause chains in narrative.
101 While bayingijba ‘be in the west’ clearly has the formal properties of a verb, it is unclear
whether it functions as a verb or an adverb in this example.
298        SyntaxIt is also possible in some contexts to chain clauses so that one tense/aspect
marker and often a pronoun has scope over more than one unmarked verb. In
(9.165), for example, which follows directly from the extract in (9.163), two tempo-
rally ordered events (shooting people and throwing them into the floodwater) are
expressed, but only the first event occurs in core-initial position and is followed
by the TA-marked pronoun. The second event is marked with a verb in post-core
position, but the arguments of the second verb are understood to be the same
arguments as the initial verb. Example (9.166), which is from the same text, illus-
trates a similar structure.(9.165)    rangimba      yali-ny=ili      janyba     mali-yurri
           shoot         3pl-acc=hab      throw      floodwater-all
           ‘(They)’d shoot them and throw them into the floodwater.’ (15.5.00.1.DR)(9.166)    wilku   buli=li          kirrijba       kingkarri    dungala-na
           run     3dunom=hab climb                up           hill-loc
           ‘They would run and climb up a hill.’ (15.5.00.1.DR)A similar structure is found in (9.167), which has three chained verbs. Only daba
‘fight/kill’ occurs in the core. In this example, it is unclear whether the verbs
indicate a sequence of temporally ordered events (e.g., fighting, then cutting in
half, then cracking (heads) open), or whether these are presented as incremental
descriptions of the nature of the violence. Note that in (9.167), but not in (9.165)
and (9.166), the three events are separated by intonation breaks.(9.167)    daba=yi       barri bula-nya, kujarramba, bangangkamba
           kill=past     pi       3du-acc   split.into.two crack.open
           ‘(He) fought the two of them, breaking them in two, cracking their
           heads open.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)In some examples, it is clearer that the post-core verb is not temporally ordered
with respect to the core-initial verb. In (9.168), the two verbs nyindijba ‘be hidden’
and jungku ‘sit’ occur either side of the second-position pronoun and seem to
describe the scene as one where the children hide by sitting next to a ghost gum
tree. Note that the order of these two verbs is reversed in the repetition, which
supports the interpretation of these events as not temporally ordered.

          be.hidden
          ‘He left us at the ghost gum. We were sitting hidden by the ghost gum.
          Like this we were sitting at the ghost gum. There with my younger
          brother, like that. We were sitting hidden.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)It is possible that the more general stance verb jungku ‘sit’, seen in (9.168), func-
tions to indicate a longer period of time in which the children lay hid – an aspec-
tual modification. Example (9.169), which is from the same text as (9.168), appears
also to have an aspectual quality of constancy over time.(9.169)   ningkinikijba       ngali         jungku     that jilbi
          watch(redup)        1duExclnom sit           that anthill
          like that, up and down
          like that, up and down
          ‘We were sitting looking at anthills (for sugarbag) like that, up and
          down.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)Constructions of two unmarked verbs, one core initial, and one following the
second-position clitic complex, are uncommon in discourse, and, therefore, it is
unclear whether it is a productive way of specifying events. The flexible ordering
seen in (9.168) would suggest that the two verbs are not hierarchically organized.
This is further supported by the fact that the two verbs do not differ morphologi-
cally. More work is required, however, to determine the extent to which verbs can
combine within clauses, and the range of meanings that can be expressed in such
combinations.
10 Discourse phenomena
This chapter focuses on forms and constructions that are used in discourse to
facilitate information packaging and intersubjectivity of discourse participants.
Information packaging concerns the ways in which speakers organize their turns
of talk to link them informationally to what has come before, or to foreshadow the
status of information in the talk to come. Some of the resources used by Garrwa
speakers to package information are described in §10.1. Section 10.2 focuses on
forms that indicate some aspect of stance-taking. Most of the forms in this section
are what traditional grammars have variously called interjections, particles, and
adverbials.¹⁰² Where possible, I try to ground the uses of all discourse phenom-
ena in a rich contextual description of how forms are used in conversation.
     A number of the Garrwa forms described here are also found in the neigh-
bouring language Yanyuwa. These include ngarri, barri, (barra in Yanyuwa),
and mili (Kirton and Charlie 1996). Given Yanyuwa otherwise unrelatedness to
Garrwa, the sharing of so many discourse level features is a symptom of the close
contact between the language groups, which results, perhaps, in a conflation of
pragmatic conventions, discourse organisation, and rhetorical style.","[314, 315, 316, 317, 318]"
"9.4.1 Grammatically determined non-canonical ordersThere are some forms that are obligatory in core-initial position: interrogative
words (§6.3), the negative particle miku (see §9.5.1), and the contrastive particle
ngala (§8.3.3). When these forms are used, they occur in the slot that verbs fill in
canonical word order sentences. TAM clitics and pronouns directly follow these
obligatorily initial elements. In such cases, the verb directly follows the core
(post-core position).a) Interrogative sentences(9.67)      wanya     yalu       yabimba

            ‘What were they making?’ (8.5.01.1.KS)91 I use the term non-canonical here to mean that the orders depart from the order of a de-
clarative, positive polarity clause with no marked pragmatics. It does not necessarily mean that
such clauses are infrequent in discourse.

92 Note that there is no pronoun in second position and that the demonstrative nayi appears
to occur where one would expect a pronoun to occur. Note that it is followed by the verb, which
is the expected order for interrogative sentences with a pronoun. More work needs to be done
to determine the syntactic status of demonstratives that follow the core-initial position.
274        Syntaxc) Ngala-contrast sentences(9.75)    ngala    ngaliya           karrinj=i      barri,       nana-nyina,

          contr 3plnom come(pl) pi                 like.this man           perhaps
          ‘But they came, like this, all the old men, possibly.’ (3.9.03.1.KS)9.4.2 Pragmatically determined non-canonical ordersThere are several identifiable contexts in which words other than those canoni-
cally found in initial position (i.e., verbs and other words that are grammatically
found in core-initial position) occur in initial position. Nouns are by far the most
frequent type of word in this position, followed by temporal adverbs. Some con-
junctions (e.g., baki) may precede them, just as some conjunctions may precede
verbs. In such contexts, the initial word precedes a pronoun, and the verb follows
the pronoun so that the pronoun retains its second-position status. In third
person singular contexts, there is no pronoun and the verb immediately follows
the initial word.
      The contexts in which this latter word order occurs include situations where
the word in question is pragmatically prominent. This prominence usually occurs
because the speaker has some motivation for making such a word stand out
from the rest of the words in the utterance. These include contexts that are often
called “focus” (e.g., Lambrecht 1994; Vallduví and Vilkuna 1998; É Kiss 1998) in
the linguistics literature – information that is at variance with assumed hearer
expectations. Such contexts might include where a word answers a question or
fills a knowledge gap (what Lambrecht (1994) calls “narrow focus”). In storytell-
ing, this initial position is used for newly introduced referents who are significant
for the plot (e.g., because they will become ongoing characters in the story, or
because they refer to plot-changing information – see Mushin (2005a) for more on
the narrative functions of initial position). In both of these contexts, the relevant
information may be new to the discourse (and possibly new to the hearer), but
newness alone is not the determining factor. As Mushin (2005a) demonstrates for
narrative, new information that has no plot significance does not occur initially.

Other common interactive contexts where non-canonical initial elements are
found include when a speaker contrasts with or contradicts something someone
else has said – cases of what I call here managing misalignments. It is also used
for rhetorical emphasis, often with a repetition of the word at the end of the utter-
ance. This of course does not exhaust the possible contexts in which a Garrwa
speaker might use such non-canonical word order. The aim here is to give a sense
of the kinds of contexts where such orders tend to be used.a) Answers to questions(9.77)    DG:     wanya     ninji      wudumba=yi          bayungu

In conversational repair sequences (i.e., dealing with problems of hearing and
understanding, or disagreements about information, information being pre-
sented as the crux of the problem occurs in initial position.
      In (9.83), the participants are discussing the location of a Salvation Army rep-
resentative who has been visiting the community. KS claims to have seen him
arriving because she was at the school before him early that morning. The first
person pronoun ngayu is initial here as KS emphasizes her witnessing of him
coming to the school. DG counters with an assertion that he arrived yesterday
(i.e., not today) and has the word for ‘yesterday’, wulani, in initial position to
contrast KS’s assertion that he was seen today.

Rhetorical emphasis is a broad term, but is used here to cover other contexts in
which information is presented as outside of the hearer’s (immediate) expecta-
tions. Words in this position can be accompanied by the superlative =mirra and
the intensifier particle mili.(9.84)    wayka-nmirra      ja=ngayu        nayi    daya

          ‘Deepest down, I’m going to cut (wood for a coolamon).’ (3.9.03.2.KS)In (9.85), the initial position is used in a narrative to contrast how the policemen
were travelling with how the prisoners were travelling.(9.85)    jila=yi        yalu      nukami-na     wujuju bayungu        jila

          ‘They (the prisoners) walked on foot all day (until) sunset, they (the
          prisoners) went. They (the policemen) were on horses.’ (3.9.03.1.KS)In (9.86) the speaker has ‘Garrwa’ in initial position to emphasize that she (and
the other old women) are talking their traditional language and not just any lan-
guage while they are being taped.

            this-loc
            ‘We’re taping ourselves here. We’re talking Garrwa here.’ (20.6.08.KS)In (9.87), DG is requesting KS to talk louder. As KS has already been speaking, it is
the ‘up’ (i.e., louder) part that she emphasizes.(9.87)      kingkarri=kiyi      yanyba
            up=imp              talk
            ‘Speak up!’ (3.9.03.2.DG)Sometimes, the emphasized word is repeated at the end of the utterance. In
(9.88), the speaker is calling to a relative to bring over some bread/vegetable food
(chips), not meat food. The word for non-meat food, mama, is initial and also
repeated at the end of the intonation unit. Examples (9.89) and (9.90) illustrate
similar constructions.⁹³(9.88)      mama=kiyi      kuyu     mama, kudadi          waliji

            ‘[I’m going to get my nullanulla] you all bring yamsticks.’ (11.5.01.1.KS)
93 Utterance-final repeated nominals may occur with or without an intonation break. Because
they are repetitions of an established nominal in core-initial position, I am hesitant to label
them as right-dislocations. Right-dislocations tend to be used for disambiguation and are
not repeated in the main clause (although a co-referential pronominal may occur in the main
clause). Furthermore, right-dislocations are always offset by an intonation break.

e) Left-dislocation
Left-dislocations are identified here as utterance-initial nominal phrases that
occur before a core, where some pronominal reference to the nominal is pre-
served in the core sentence. In most cases, core-initial position will be filled by a
verb, and the second-position pronoun in the core will share person and number
categories with the left-dislocated nominal group. Left-dislocations are harder to
identify in third person singular contexts because third person singular nomina-
tive pronouns are only used in emphatic contexts.
      There is usually an intonation break between the left-dislocated constituent
and the rest of the clause. Third person singular left dislocations are, therefore,
best formally identified by this intonation break. These features separate left-
dislocated constituents from core-initial nominals of the kind seen in examples
(9.88) to (9.90) above.
      Mushin (2005a) identifies systematic functional differences between nomi-
nals in left-dislocated and nominals in core-initial position. Like core-initial nom-
inals, left-dislocated elements may be used for new referents. The main difference
is that left-dislocation is not used in contexts of prominence. In (9.91), the aunt
and older sister go off to hunt at night leaving the narrator and her brother behind.
These two female relatives never return to the narrative. Similarly, in (9.92), which
is the opening utterance of the narrative, the mother is never mentioned again
(i.e., never established as a character). So left-dislocation seems associated with
the newness of referents, but not in contexts of prominence.(9.91)    biliki-yurru, baki maju ngaki,           balba bul=i

          ‘Mother, (she) was asleep.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)Left-dislocations may introduce new characters into narrative that are mentioned
again in the story, although I have no examples of left-dislocations being used for
principal characters. In both (9.93) and (9.94), the left-dislocated nominal group
is the first mention of a character, but not the main character of the story.

determined non-canonical orders. This section provides a more detailed descrip-
tion of how these kinds of sentences are formed.","[290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298]"
"9.3.4 Ordering of adjunctsCore-only sentences are rare in actual discourse. Most sentences contain addi-
tional linguistic material in the form of clause combiners (conjunctions), modi-
fiers (adjuncts), and nominal groups that refer to core arguments. Adjuncts can
come before or after the core, although they are usually follow the core and its
associated nominal arguments. Adjuncts tend to follow nominal groups if both
are present.(9.57)    ngaraba=kiyi      waja

          ‘We got up early.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)9.3.5 IncrementsThe above examples all feature simple sentences uttered under a single intona-
tion contour. In actual discourse, where turns of talk are built up in real time,
core argument nominal groups and adjuncts usually follow the core where it is
offset by an intonation break. This results in increments of information that relate
to the event denoted by the verbal or non-verbal predicate. Examples (9.62) to
(9.65) illustrate these incremented sentences. Note that, whether found under the
same intonation contour or separated by an intonation break (signalled with a
comma), core-argument nominal groups and adjuncts are far more commonly
follow the verb+TAM+pronoun core than precede it. Where the increment is co-
referential with a core argument pronoun, the structure takes the form of a right-
dislocation construction.(9.62)    kuyu     nurri-ny=i            bayanga-rri, kanjibul-wanyi

            ‘They were climbing all over, up all over the hill.’In (9.66), the core precedes four intonationally demarcated increments – the first
two are locative adjuncts, and the last two are subject nominals.(9.66)      yunduwinbana nayi kulalawira-na, yarrama, jidi                   buluki

that is, where verbs are in core-initial position and pronouns are in second posi-
tion. Non-canonical word orders have been divided into two types: grammatically
determined non-canonical orders, and pragmatically determined non-canonical
orders.","[288, 289, 290]"
"7.5.1 -Ji ‘purpose’Complex clauses marked with –ji ‘purp’ mean ‘do X in order to do Y’. In intransi-
tive clauses, the subject of the subordinate clause must be co-referent with the
subject of the main clause, and is only mentioned in the main clause. In transitive
clauses, the object may also be co-referential.(7.129)    kuyu     ja=ngayu         narri-nya bayanga-rri yingki-ji

192        Verbs7.5.2 -Jiwa ‘subsequent’Like the purposive construction, subordinate clauses marked with -jiwa ‘subse-
quent’ must share a co-referential subject with the main clause, and they must
denote an event that takes place subsequent to the event in the main clause (‘X
until Y happens’). That is, the event denoted in the subordinate clause marks a
subsequent or concluding action that was brought about by the event denoted in
the main clause. For example, in (7.134), the eating of food is a subsequent action
predicated on the subject first getting up. Similarly, in (7.135), the cooking of the
goanna is framed as the subsequent action which is dependent on the killing
of the goanna in the first instance. In (7.136), the projected recording session is
framed as a subsequent event to the linguist’s return (she was absent at the time
this was uttered).(7.134)   kuluka=ngka walajba=ngka          ja-jiwa    wada

          (8.5.01.1.KS)In all of these examples, -jiwa is used in a context where event X is clearly pre-
sented as a precursor or prerequisite to event Y (‘X until Y’). Analysing -jiwa as a

signal of the endpoint of a sequence of events is, however, also compatible with
a purposive reading. As an endpoint, the second event can be read as the inten-
tional consequence of performing the first event (‘do X in order to Y’). This is the
meaning attributed to -jiwa in Furby and Furby (1977). The suffix -jiwa differs from
-ji in that it does not require the agent of the events to have a conscious intention
(‘Y as a consequence of X’, ‘X leading up to Y’). The following examples appear to
incorporate a (weak) purposive meaning, which indicates the close relationship
between -ji and -jiwa.(7.139)   baki     burrijba ngali            karurri-ji  barri, wudumbi-jiwa

          ‘They used to bring the milk from up (there) and/to boil it.’ (28.3.00.1.KS)Forms that focus on events as endpoints may additionally be analysed as resul-
tative constructions (‘Y as a result of X’). Results are usually expressed as end
states, however. It is not clear from my current data whether the –jiwa marked
clause is viewed as a result.
     Another difference between the purposive -ji and the subsequent -jiwa is the
ability for subordinate clauses with -jiwa to occur following the co-ordinating
conjunction baki ‘and’ (described in §9.6.1). The use of baki, which is the regular
conjoiner of temporally ordered clauses, raises the possibility that speakers do
not always treat -jiwa clauses as subordinate. It is not possible for clauses marked
with the other verb inflections to occur with conjunctions. -Jiwa may be special
because it has temporal ordering as part of its core meaning, and this is what may
be motivating its co-occurrence with baki.(7.141)   kakalijba      yal=i            nanda baki yalu

subject as the main clause. It is commonly used to form complements to verbs of
communication and cognition. It is also used in the formation of negative verbs.
When the main verb is a verb of speaking or cognition, the subordinate clause
represents the action being thought or spoken (e.g., ‘I told her to X’, ‘I thought
about X’) rather than the content of speech/thought as in indirect speech repre-
sentation. The suffix -kanyi is glossed with irrealis because it always occurs in
contexts where the proposition of the subordinate clause is not realised, which is
usually because the proposition in question is a thought, desire, or words of the
subject of the main clause, and not a representation of the actualisation of the
proposition.(7.144)    mankumanku       ngaka        wadambi-kanyi

-Kanyi is also used for complements of verbs of feeling and desire, which (7.148) to
(7.150) illustrate .(7.148)    karijba         ngayu       jila-kanyi

           ‘Those two used to bury them, in case we wanted to eat it.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)A third context for the use of -kanyi seems close to the purposive meaning
described for -ji (§7.5.1 above). All examples from Furby and Furby (1977) have
-kanyi occurring in contexts where the purposive clause denotes something done
habitually, or when attention is being drawn to the general utility of the object in
the main clause. It does not denote any particular instance of the event in ques-
tion. In this sense, the subordinate clause appears to function as a modifier of the
object of the main clause. Examples (7.151) to (7.155) come from Furby and Furby
(1977), but I have re-translated the examples to better reflect the use of the irrealis
suffix to signal certain kinds of habitual behaviours.(7.151)    karu       nurru           nanda madajangu nurru

ous actions, ones where the activity described in the switch-reference marked
clause must coincide in time with the event / activity in the main clause. Exam-
ples (7.156) to (7.159) illustrate this. In this sense, switch-reference marked clauses
are aspectually activities.
    The suffix -jina marks co-reference between the subject of the main clause
and the subject of the subordinate clause (i.e., subject control), while -kurri marks
co-reference between the object of the main clause and the subject of the subor-
dinate clause (i.e., object control).(7.156)    bak=ili       yalu      waradijba    wawarra        ngara-jina

           KS)While there are clear temporal framing restrictions for the acceptability of switch
reference coding, there do not seem to be any general valency restrictions with
respect to switch reference marking. These clauses can be transitive or intran-
sitive. Note that the subject of the transitive subordinate clause takes its case
marking from its role in the main clause. That is, it does not have the expected
ergative marking but rather absolutive marking as the object of the main clause.a) Intransitive main clause, transitive switch reference clause(7.160)    jibarri      yakirrimba      nangka  da-jina

           ‘I hear (them) singing at his camp in the north.’ (Furby and Furby 1977:
           6.2.1.5)Although they can occur in descriptions of manner of speech, which (7.164) and
(7.165) illustrate, switch reference contexts does not seem to be compatible with
reported speech contexts. That is, the content of speech does not count as a
simultaneous action. This is interesting because the content of perception does
count as a simultaneous action for the purposes of switch reference marking. One
explanation is that speech representation (whether direct or indirect) involves a
shift in perspective from the framing clause of speech to the content of speech.
Perception sentences do not involve a shift in perspective.
     Note also that switch reference is not used when the content of speech
expresses some embedded illocutionary force, such as a command (-kanyi is used
in these contexts).(7.164)    kaya       nyul=i          nimbala-nya ngabaya-wanyi

The following examples from Belfrage’s (1991) field notes illustrate the incom-
patibility of switch reference markers with representing the content of reported
speech. In (7.166), the irrealis -kanyi is used, while in (7.167), the content of speech
is represented as direct speech with a deictic shift to future tense in the second
clause.(7.166)    a.       yilikajba     ngay=i            nyulu      jilaj-kanyi

verb is still going or continuing. Because this morpheme seems exclusive to verbs
(there is another homophonous morpheme -wa that attaches to directionals and
demonstratives to reinforce directionality – see §6.1.3.2) and not associated with
a position, I do not analyse this as a tense/aspect clitic. Semantically, it has more
in common with other aspectual clitics.

7.6.2 -Warr ‘characteristic’The characteristic suffix -warr derives a noun from a verb that means ‘thing/
person that is characterized by [Verb]’. Some uses of verb-warr seem convention-
alized as in ngarrkadaba-warr ‘spear-char’ for the health clinic (=place where
one gets injections) or kijijba-warr ‘tie.up-char’ for policeman, while others seem
productively constructed for a particular context. Verb+-warr constructions are
often found as modifiers of other nominals. For verb+warr constructions derived
from transitive verbs, the object of the transitive verb may be expressed with
dative case marking, which (7.179) and (7.180) illustrate.(7.174)   ngala      nyul=i           nayi wayka ngarrkadaba-warr

predicates and yet have surface forms that look like verbs, in particular the -mba
stem ending. These adverbs never occur as the sole predicate in clauses and
cannot take verb inflectional morphology. They do not occur clause initially in
unmarked contexts. In fact, they mostly occur either in their own intonation unit
or utterance finally. Meanings are quantificational or spatio-temporal, and often
aspectually modifying the main predicate.","[209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217, 218, 219, 220]"

58 It is possible that the reduplicated form is more associated with a distributive reading
rather than a plural object, so that (7.91) means that the waterlilies were distributed among
each individual person, whereas (7.92) (unreduplicated) is not so concerned with the distribu-
tion of food among numbers of people. Alternatively, the objects of reduplicated verbs may be
less individuated than non-reduplicated verbs. Resolution of the precise meaning of the partial
reduplication of verb roots requires further investigation.

            (15.5.01.1.DG)There are also a number of verbs whose roots appear to be fully reduplicated, but
which do not have clear unreduplicated counterparts. Unlike the partially redu-
plicated examples above, these do not appear to be productive. It may be that the
roots were already reduplicated forms (coverbs or nominals) before the current
verb system developed.(7.101)     balabalaba ‘splash in water’ (*balaba)
            bijibijimba ‘plait hair’ (*bijimba)
            jalajalaba ‘shake’ (*jalaba)59 Ningkiningkijba involves reduplication of the whole root, not just the second syllable. It is
unclear what motivates this variation from the regular pattern of reduplication seen in other
verbs.

            ngarringarrijba ‘hide something’ (ngarrijba ‘be warm’ seems unrelated)There are also a number of fully reduplicated verb roots where the first consonant
of the reduplicated part is lenited (d~rr, d~w, b~w, or j~l). Many of these are class
3 conjugations. While some of these do have related unreduplicated variants, it is
not clear what motivates their reduplication (see §2.5.1 for a more general descrip-
tion of reduplication).(7.102)     barriwarrimba ‘be.opposite’

any verbs that require three arguments (cf. ditransitive constructions in other
languages). Many constructions can have participants marked as obliques (typi-
cally with dative case marking), but the case frame of the verb does not require
these. As Garrwa lacks agreement marking, and frequently only one argument is
expressed in the second-position clitic cluster, it is difficult to determine which
verbs necessarily take two arguments, and which may take two arguments under
certain circumstances. In addition to the lack of obligatory cross-referencing of
arguments, the only clear means of changing valency appears to be in the use
of the reflexive forms of pronouns (under (d) below, and in §5.5) in contexts of
reduced transitivity. There do not appear to be any other morphosyntactic means
of changing valency (e.g., transitivising or intransitivising morphemes; passive or
anti-passive constructions).⁶⁰
60 Because of the lack of consistent cross-referencing of pronouns and nominals (cf. many
other Australian languages), I analyse full nominals as arguments when they occur.
                                                 Case frames and argument structure              185
In order to account for the different patterns of predicates and arguments and
their respective case frames found in the data, I identify four basic constructions
that express these interactions: intransitive, transitive, semi-transitive, and reflex-
ive/reciprocal, into which verbs may fit.⁶¹ The transitive and intransitive con-
structions are mutually exclusive (verbs are found in one or the other), but there
is scope for these verbs to occur in semi-transitive and reflexive frames if their
semantics is compatible. In the following sections, I describe the four construc-
tions (for more on case marking and roles, see §4.4) and give some examples of
the kinds of verbs that regularly occur in each type of construction.a) Intransitive constructions comprise an S-argument only in an unmarked case
(nominative or absolutive).⁶² An overt S-argument, especially in third person sin-
gular contexts, is not obligatory. Basic motion and stance verbs tend to occur in
intransitive constructions.(7.103)      ngaki     wulukanja      balba=yi,             karri

             go      3plnom=hab         up-dir

             ‘We would sit/stay at the camp.’ (1.5.01.2.TD)(7.107)      walajba=yi
             emerge=past
             ‘(He/She) got up.’ (Hale 1962 field notes)61 Following principles of Construction Grammar (e.g., Goldberg 1995), argument structure is
considered a property of the construction rather than the verb.
62 Following Dixon (1979), I use the notation ‘A’ for the subject in a transitive construction, ‘S’
for the subject in an intransitive construction, and ‘O’ for the object in a transitive construction.
186        Verbsb) Transitive constructions comprise two expressed arguments: A and O. The
A-argument takes ergative case if it is nominal, and nominative case if it is pro-
nominal. The O-argument is unmarked if it is nominal, and accusative if it is
pronominal. It is unusual to find the two arguments in a transitive construction
both expressed by nominals – at least one of these is usually a pronoun. The
A-argument is also often omitted in third person contexts if the referent is easily
recoverable from discourse (cf. DuBois 1987). The O-argument may also remain
unexpressed, especially if the object is third person singular. Example (7.112) has
both arguments unexpressed. Both are third person singular referents that are
well established in the discourse (they are story characters).(7.108)    daba ngana        yal=i
           hit     1sgacc 3plnom=past
           ‘They hit me.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)(7.109)    daba     yal=i             nanda wadaba
           hit      3plnom=past       that       goanna(sp)
           ‘They killed that goanna.’ (1.5.01.1.TD)(7.110)    daba    ngan=i            kangku-wanyi
           hit     1sgacc=past FF-erg
           ‘Grandfather hit me.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)(7.111)    daba=yi       juka-wanyi      nanda      bajangu
           hit=past      boy-erg         that       dog
           ‘The boy hit that dog.’ (Belfrage 1991 field notes)(7.112)    daba=yi
           hit=past
           ‘(He = grandfather) hit (him = younger brother).’ (15.5.01.1.DG)Verbs that describe the transferral of objects (e.g., expressed in English with ‘give’,
‘send’, etc) are commonly expressed by ditransitive (three argument) construc-
tions cross-linguistically. In Garrwa, such verbs tend to occur in transitive con-
structions. For example, the verb wajba, commonly translated as ‘give’, is clearly
transitive (like English ‘provide’), although, as (7.114) illustrates, the theme (the
object transferred) may be marked obliquely.

           ‘You bring me a shirt / You provide me with a shirt.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)c) Semi-transitive constructions comprise two expressed arguments, one of which
has nominative marking, and one of which has dative (oblique) marking. Verbs
that are normally found in intransitive constructions can occur in semi-transitive
constructions when it is important to express an oblique argument as the benefi-
ciary, goal, or recipient of the action. Some verbs (e.g., yanyba ‘say’, kujba ‘hunt’,
and yadajba ‘wait’) almost always occur with an oblique argument.(7.117)    yanyba=yi      ngayu         nanga-ngi
           talk=past      1sgnom        3sg-dat
           ‘I said to him…’ (15.5.01.1.DG)(7.118)    kujba    nurr=i                jukubayi-nyi      yalibala

           ‘We hunted for sugarbag early (in the morning).’ (15.5.01.1.DG)(7.119)    yuku           barri yadajba nurru                    narri-ngi   mada

           ‘All right, we’ll wait for you all together.’ (1.5.01.2.TD)d) Reflexive constructions comprise a single reflexively marked argument con-
strued as more than one participant (‘self to self’ reflexively or ‘self and other’
reciprocally). There are a number of verbs that appear to always (or almost always)
188         Verbsoccur in reflexive constructions. These seem to be verbs associated with the use
of inalienable possessions, such as body parts and vocalisations. For example:(7.120)     barawara      ngaka      kulaji
            shake.head    1sgrefl head
            ‘I’m shaking my head.’ (Mushin 2008 field notes)(7.121)     bunduwarrajba       nangka     buluki
            bellow              3sgrefl    cattle
            ‘The cattle are bellowing.’ (Mushin 2008 field notes)(7.122)     dakalmba           nangka
            stand.feet.apart 3sgrefl
            ‘He’s standing, feet apart.’ (Mushin 2006 field notes)Other verbs are frequently found in reflexive constructions on the basis of their
semantics, but can also be used in transitive constructions. The context determines
whether the reflexive pronoun marks an activity being done reflexively or recipro-
cally. These kinds of patterns support the analysis that reflexivity is a property of
the construction rather than an inherent property of the verb itself. For example:(7.123)     a. Transitive construction
            wadamba=yili        ngayu     yalu-nya      barri,    bukamba

            ‘I used to feed them – the whole lot (of them).’ (28.3.00.3.TD)            b. Reflexive construction

63 While in many cases either the reflexive or reciprocal reading is possible, this utterance
cannot mean that they are going to feed each other.

meaning in a transitive construction. For example, the verb janyba means ‘throw’
in a transitive construction, but is conventionally used to mean ‘die’ in a reflexive
construction (example (7.126) illustrates this below). Similarly, the verb yukumba
means ‘wait (for)’ in a semi-transitive construction (i.e., nominative subject,
dative object), but to ‘be in labour’ in a reflexive construction. I use the conven-
tional meanings as glosses in each case, even though it is clear that the verb is the
same in either construction.(7.126)   a. Transitive construction

            ‘My mother was in labour down (there).’ (28.8.03.1.TD)7.5 Verb inflectional morphologyGarrwa verbs have little inflectional morphology because many meanings asso-
ciated with verb inflectional categories (e.g., tense, aspect, mood, agreement)
are either positional enclitics (which may or may not be attached to verbs) or
not signalled at all (e.g., gender, person, number agreement). The only morphol-
ogy exclusively associated with verbs functions to turn the verb (and its comple-
ments) into a complement of another clause. These are analysed as dependent
because they cannot occur as independent clauses, nor can they attract tense/
aspect clitics (see §9.6.1 for a description of the syntax of dependent clauses).
     These are five such morphemes, each indicating a different relationship
between the main and subordinate clauses: -ji ‘purposive’, -jiwa ‘subsequence’,
-jina ‘same subject simultaneous’, -kurri ‘different subject simultaneous’, and
-kanyi ‘irrealis’.⁶⁴
     These suffixes are built from two initial elements, -ji or -kV-, and a case suffix
as follows:(7.128)     -wa ‘directional’⁶⁵                        -jiwa ‘subsequent’
            -(i)na ‘locative’                          -jina ‘same subject’
            -(yu)rri ‘allative’                        -kurri ‘different subject’⁶⁶
            -(a)nyi ‘dative’                           -kanyi ‘irrealis’64 Furby and Furby (1977) analyse all of these suffixes as allomorphs (realisations) of a pur-
pose morpheme (tagmeme). It is clear, however, that they have quite different meanings.
65 This suffix attaches to directional and locative words only.
66 The allomorphs of allative and dative case markers for demonstratives are also -kurri and
-kanyi respectively. It may be that these are the earlier forms for the case suffixes, with pro-
cesses of lenition and reduction leading to the allomorphs used for most nouns.

The association with case marking and their subordinate status suggests that
these verb forms are indeed participial forms as Furby and Furby (1977) suggest.
     These suffixes attach to the -mbi allomorph of class 1 verbs, to the -j or  stem
form of class 2 verbs, and to the -n stem of class 3 verbs, with the initial /j/ → /k/
for purposive, subsequence, and same-subject suffixes.","[200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208, 209]"

88 Although text counts show that pronouns occur in second position in the vast majority
(<90%) of cases in Garrwa discourse.
268          SyntaxExamples (9.47) to (9.49) illustrate pronouns occurring in positions other than
second position in the core. In each example, an initial and preverbal pronoun
expresses a referent in contrast with other referents. In (9.48), for example, the
speaker (in Borroloola) instructs the addressee (the linguist) to go east (to Robin-
son River) where Garrwa people will be able to talk to her about the Garrwa lan-
guage. The speaker then claims to have forgotten much Garrwa in contrast with
the Robinson River people who have not. The utterance consists of three main
clauses: an imperative clause; a future+pronoun-initial clause, and a pronoun-
initial clause.⁸⁹(9.47)      yalu       yanyba     yalu-ngi-nkanyi wawarra-nyi         Garrwa

depends entirely on a) whether the argument is expressed as a noun/nominal
group or as a pronoun, and b) the information status of the arguments in a given
clause. The effects of information status on this order are discussed in general
in §9.4 and §10.1. It is unusual for more than one argument to be expressed as
a noun or nominal group.⁹⁰ Pronominal arguments are almost always found in89 Further work is required to determine whether the initial ja= in sentences such as example
(9.48) should be analysed as core initial alone or together with the pronoun. For now, I analyse
the construction ja= + pronoun as constuting initial position together.
90 This is consistent with DuBois’ (1987) “preferred argument structure”.

second position, and the order in that position is mostly described in Chapter 5
(Pronouns). Nominal arguments, whether A, S, or O, are most frequently found
directly following the second-position clitic cluster.(9.50)    jilajba=yi   nanda juka
          walk=past that         boy
          ‘That boy went.’ (nominal S) (8.5.01.1.KS)(9.51)    daba     ngan=i           kangku-wanyi
          hit      1sgacc=past      FF-erg

          ‘They would cook waterlilies.’ (nominal O) (3.9.03.2.KS)Oblique pronouns also tend to occur directly after the second position in the core.(9.53)    baki     yanyba=yi       ngali-ngi
          and      say=past        1duExcl-dat
          ‘And he said to us two…’ (15.5.01.1.DG)(9.54)    baki      yanyba     ngay=i             nanga-ngi
          and       say        1sgnom=past        3sg-dat
          ‘And I said to him…’ (15.5.01.1.DG)The status of arguments that directly follow second position requires careful
analysis. Under a RRG interpretation of the core (i.e., as a main verb plus its argu-
ments – see Van Valin and LaPolla 1997: 26), this information should be analysed
as part of the core itself. However, as §9.4 and §10.1 illustrate below, there are
various contexts in which such arguments are found elsewhere, which includes
in core-initial position and, depending on their information status, in right and
left dislocations. Furthermore, as §5.6 illustrates, there are many contexts in
which nouns or nominal groups referring to core arguments have co-referential
pronouns in second position. This is particularly the case with non-singular third
person arguments, which (9.55) illustrates.(9.55)    najba     narri     yalu-nya bayamuku nanda kunyumba
          see       2plnom 3pl-acc child-pl that             be.done.properly
          ‘You all watch those kids properly.’ (4.5.01.3.DG)
270        SyntaxIn most cases, however, co-referential nouns and nominal groups are set off into-
nationally from the rest of the clause, which (9.56) illustrates.(9.56)    dabarraba=yili       yalu,      badidibadi-wanyi
          cook.in.ashes=hab 3plnom old.woman(redup)-erg
          ‘They would cook in ashes, the old women (would).’ (2.5.01.1.KS)Therefore, there is a clear disassociation between the expression of arguments as
fulfilling the semantic requirements of verbs, and their formal realisation. Further
analysis of the relationship between prosody and syntactic structure may clarify
the status of arguments directly following the second-position clitic cluster.
The most appropriate analysis may be one that analyses nominals as syntactic
adjuncts that are co-referential with argument positions represented by pronouns
in the second-position clitic cluster (the pronominal argument hypothesis – see,
for example, Jelinek (1984)). However, further analysis of the status of pronouns
in Garrwa grammar is required before such a claim can be definitively made.","[285, 286, 287, 288]"
"9.6.1.1 Subject shared between main and dependent clause

           notes)9.6.1.2 Different subject between main and dependent clause
In the following examples, the object of the main clause is the understood subject
of the dependent clause. This pivot argument usually occurs just prior to the
dependent clause, which creates a link between the two clauses. Therefore, the
case forms of the pivot are consistent with the analysis that the subject of the
dependent clause is the object of the main clause. When the pivot is a nominal
group, it is found in the absolutive (i.e., unmarked) form, even when it functions
as the subject of a transitive dependent clause, a context that would normally
result in ergative case marking (which (9.145) and (9.16) illustrate). When the pivot
is a pronoun, it is in accusative case, which (9.147) and (9.148) illustrate. In (9.147),
where the dependent clause has a reciprocal argument, the pronoun is repeated
in the dependent clause with the reflexive/reciprocal marker -ngka.

to (9.151) illustrate. In these cases, there may be more than one pivot, but the
same pattern applies regardless of whether the pivot connects a main clause with
a dependent clause, or whether it connects a dependent clause with a dependent
clause.

           ‘I tell (you) to listen to me talking.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)Overall, dependent clauses are not common in discourse, so the corpus of non-
elicited examples is small compared with the number of elicited examples, which
the examples above illustrate. In most of these examples, elicited or otherwise,
dependent clauses follow directly from the main clause with a shared argument
(subject or direct object of main clause) that provides the pivot between the
clauses. Examples occurring in texts show that dependent clauses do not neces-
sarily occur directly following the pivot. In (9.152) to (9.154), the dependent clause
follows locative expressions, the discourse particle barri, and the intensifier par-
ticle mili. In these three examples, however, the dependent clause comes at the
very end of the utterance.(9.152)    baki     burrijba ngali                 karurri-ji       barri,

          ‘Quick, you and me gotta go to eat dinner.’ (3.9.03.4.DG)There are a few examples in the corpus, mostly from Belfrage and Furbys’ field
notes, of subsequential dependent clauses following the co-ordinating conjunc-
tion baki ‘and’, which, among other things, indicates a temporal ordering of
events (see §8.3.1 and §9.6.2). The first three examples occur with subsequential
clauses, and are perhaps possible because the relationship between main and
dependent clauses is primarily a temporal one. The dependent clause indicates
an event or action as the endpoint of the event or action in the main clause. It
also suggests that, while subsequential clauses are morphologically similar to
other dependent clauses, that they are less clearly a kind of subordinate clause or
a participial clause of the kind seen in the above examples (see §7.5.2 for further
discussion).(9.155)   kakalijba    yal=i           nanda baki         yalu

tion to link clauses together. These particles most often occur at the beginning of
the second connected clause/utterance, the exception being minji ‘conditional’,
which occurs in first or second position of the first connected clause.

The clause-combining particles vary not only in the relationship between the
clauses they combine, but also in the grammatical properties of the combined
clause. The particular properties of each individual particle is described in §8.3
but summarized in the following table.
      Clause-combining particles that do not attract second-position pronouns
(i.e., baki and mada), are clearly co-ordinating two independent clauses, each
with their own core, their own arguments, and their own tense/aspect/modal
marking (see §8.3 for more examples). The particles in these constructions must
be analysed as external to the clausal core.(9.158)   [lalanba    ngayu      yaji]   baki     [dudijba nanda miya]
          watch       1sgnom place and            crawl     that    snake
          ‘I’m watching the place and that snake came out.’ (Mushin 2010 field
          notes)(9.159)   [jilajba=yili     nurru       juju,       juju        barri,]

          ‘We would walk a long way, long way. Also we’d bring back watermel-
          ons.’ (1.5.01.2.TD)The other three particles’ (ngala, jala, and minji) presence attracts second-posi-
tion pronouns, evidence that they function as the core-initial constituent in the
combined clause. This makes the combined clause less like an independent
clause even though it has tense/aspect marking and may have a different subject
from the first clause in the sequence.(9.160)   najba      ngay=i          yalu-nya ngala yalu

"1.3 Linguistic affiliationGarrwa, along with neighbouring Waanyi, belongs to the Garrwan language
family. Garrwa itself consists of at least two varieties: Heavy Garrwa, sometimes
called Gunindirri/Kunindirri or Eastern Garrwa; and Light Garrwa or Western
Garrwa. Harvey (2009: 195) considers the Garrwan language family to comprise
three distinctive varieties – Garrwa proper, Gunindirri, and Waanyi. All of the
Garrwa speakers surveyed for this study agree that Gunindirri is a variety of
Garrwa and that Waanyi is a different language. Garrwa speakers also recognize
the closer relationship between Garrwa and Waanyi, which are clearly genetically
related, and the other surrounding languages (e.g., Yanyuwa, Wambaya, Gudanji,
Ganggalida), which are not related.
    Breen (2003: 430) provides a comparative list of 179 lexical items in both
Eastern and Western Garrwa and Waanyi, and comparisons between Garrwa,
Waanyi, and surrounding languages. His findings are summarized in terms of
cognate percentages in Table 1.
    The percentage of cognate vocabulary support speakers’ perceptions that
Eastern (Gunindirri) Garrwa and Western Garrwa are the same language but that
Waanyi is a different, yet related, language. In addition to the relatively high per-
centage of cognate vocabulary, Garrwa and Waanyi also have similar grammars:
they share most pronouns and word order patterns, case marking, and verb mor-4 Many have told me that many Yanyuwa speakers also know Garrwa and can speak it because
it is an easier language than Yanyuwa. Most of the Garrwa speakers I have worked with agree
with this and few of them know much Yanyuwa despite living in close proximity.

phology; moreover, they both lack noun classes and other agreement morphol-
ogy.
     The much smaller percentages of shared vocabulary between Garrwa and
other languages of the region are also evidence that Garrwa and Waanyi should
be classified together as one language family separate from neighbouring lan-
guages.
     In recent years, there has been considerable debate concerning whether the
genetic status the Garrwan language family as a whole is Pama-Nyungan (PN)
or Non-Pama-Nyungan (NPN). This is the main distinction between Austral-
ian language families. Of key concern is the mixed-heritage of the free pronoun
system, which appears to have both Pama-Nyungan and Non-Pama-Nyungan
origins (e.g., 3sg nyulu and 3du bula are clearly PN in origin, whereas 2sg ninji
and 2pl narri are not). On this basis, Blake (1990: 61–63) concludes that Garrwan
is Non-Pama-Nyungan. He also cites the lack of cognate case markers with PN
languages as further evidence of this classification. Evans (2005) also classifies
Garrwan as Non-Pama-Nyungan, but, in his branching model, he classifies it as
an immediate sister of PN, with Garrwan the last split before Pama-Nyungan.
Harvey (2009), however, argues that Garrwa is typologically distinct because it
displays many innovations not found in other Australian languages. He argues
that the evidence from pronoun reconstruction and sound changes points to a
genetic relationship with Pama-Nyungan.
     Whether PN or NPN, the Garrwan languages are typologically distinctive
among Australian languages. Examples of grammatical features that are distinc-
tive of Garrwan languages (although not necessarily exclusively) include: verb-
initial basic word order, a lack of nominal classes or classifiers, compound pro-
nouns (Garrwa only, not Waanyi), tense/aspect positional clitics (Garrwa only,
not Waanyi), and rudimentary phonemic status of retroflexion. Breen (2003),
Mushin (2006), and Harvey (2009) note some shared features with the Yirram
branch of the Mirndi family (especially Wambaya and Gudanji), which includes
                                                                 Social organization        7
second-position clitic clusters and elements of verb morphology. However, these
are more likely to be the result of extensive contact rather than shared genetic
heritage.","[23, 24, 25]"
"9.1.1 Case marking in nominal groupsIn some Australian languages, all members of the group must be case-marked;
in other Australian languages, only one element needs to be case-marked if the
elements are contiguous. In Garrwa, most of the time all members of a nominal
group are case-marked whether contiguous or discontinuous.⁸²
81 The description presented here is mostly based on patterns of ordering observed in actual
usage in the Garrwa corpus, rather than on a detailed analysis of elicited data. More detailed
elicitation would undoubtably enhance the analysis of some of the structures by establishing
boundaries of grammaticality, but structures at the boundaries may be rare in usage.
82 There are a few examples in the corpus where not all members of a nominal group appear
with case marking, but it is clear from elicitation that speakers greatly prefer (and will edit texts
to ensure) all members of a nominal group to have their own case marking. In most cases, I use
unedited text data as examples in this work.

nominal group.
                                                                Nominal groups            257

           ‘(I’ve) told that one his grandfather (father’s father).’ (8.5.01.1.KS)Possessive pronouns can occur either side of the possessed nominal, although
they precede the possessed nominals far more frequently than they follow them.
Example (9.10) demonstrates this variability in the one text.⁸³(9.9)      langandaba ja=ngayu          ngaki        diraji
           hang.up        fut=1sgnom 1sgdat          dress

           ‘My father stayed over there. My mother remained at Wollogorang,
           when they had us kids.’ (25.8.03.1.ER)Otherwise, there seems to be no clear preference for the ordering of nominals in
groups. Nominals with qualitative meanings (e.g., those whose meanings would
be expressed by adjectives in English) may precede or follow nominals with more
concrete meanings.(9.11)     ngila walkurra baki            juka walkurra
           girl     big         and       boy    big
           ‘big girl and big boy’ (11.8.03.1.TD)
83 Almost all examples of nominal groups with possessed nominals in the corpus are pos-
sessed kin terms.
258        Syntax(9.12)    wuluwulu     kulaji

          ‘The big black snake crawled past the two of them.’ (Furby and Furby
          1977: 3.1.9)Information status is one possible motivating reason for the ordering of words
in nominal groups. Nouns that represent recently mentioned information tend
to occur last in the group. This is consistent with the general ordering principle
to put the most prominent (here the newest) information before less prominent
information in Garrwa. Examples (9.14) and (9.15), which are from the same text,
illustrate this pragmatically based variation with the order of two co-referent
nouns. In the first example, both mundangu ‘long-necked turtle’ and walkurra
‘big one’ are newly mentioned in the discourse. However, in the next example,
mali ‘floodwater’ has been mentioned in the previous utterance. The new infor-
mation here is provided by walkurra ‘big’, which occurs before mali.(9.14)    yubal-ina wayka      wudumba yal=i
          road-loc    down     get          3plnom=past

          ‘Down the road they got a big long-necked turtle.’ (4.5.01.5.KS)(9.15)    mali           nurr=i                 yabimba=yi       nana-ba,

          big          floodwater
          ‘We had a flood over there – a big flood.’ (4.5.01.5.KS)Similarly, in (9.16), wadara ‘humpy’ is a referent that has been mentioned as a
location in the previous utterance (where it occurs initially in the nominal group).
The nominal group is a conversational repair that explicitly changes the humpy’s
owner from the speaker to the father. Wadara occurs last in the second group,
which is consistent with its information status.

          ‘…in our humpy, that father’s humpy.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)9.1.3 Discontinuous nominal groupsNominal groups need not be contiguous. The following examples demonstrate
that a range of forms may occur between members of a nominal group. In most
cases, a demonstrative or possessive pronoun is separated from a co-referential
nominal. Such separations are not common in discourse in an intonation unit,
but they do occur as the following examples illustrate. In most cases, the inter-
vening word or words have some kind of adjunct function that indicate spatial
orientation (which (9.17) illustrates ) or some other kind of adverbial modification
(which (9.18) and (9.19) illustrate).(9.17)    nayinda     langi-na      wirringarra badajba=yi
          this        north-abl     cyclone          come=past

          ‘Big mob of blackfellas still alive living like this.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)Example (9.20) is the only example in the corpus of a discontinuous nominal
group where the co-referential demonstrative occurs later in the clause with
respect to the nominal.(9.20)    ngarrki mili=yili           yalu       nanda wanyimba?
          gravy      intens=hab 3plnom that               what-class1
          ‘They also used to (drink) that gravy – what did they do?’ (2.5.01.1.KS)It is also not uncommon for nominal groups to be separated with the discourse
marker barri (see §10.1.1 for a description of barri).
260          Syntax(9.21)      kuluka ngay=i               nana-nyina yingka-na                    barri

            ‘This my woman / This woman (is) mine.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)The observed patterns of ordering and contiguity of nominal groups in the corpus
suggests a preference for co-referential members of a nominal group to stick
together and for the least prominent common nominal to occur last in the group.
Consistent case marking of this group’s elements also suggest that speakers treat
these as items contributing to the elaboration of a semantic role (whether a core
argument or an oblique role). However, the flexibility of ordering and the capacity
for discontinuity suggests that nominal groups do not constitute a clearly defined
syntactic unit. It is for this reason that I characterize these as groups rather than
phrases – group membership is determined by co-reference.","[273, 274, 275, 276, 277, 278]"
"
This is the order given in speaker’s utterances in almost all elicitation contexts.
In declarative sentences of positive polarity, where there is no marked pragmatic
constituent (§9.4.2), the verb is the initial element of the core. In many other con-
texts, other elements may occur as the initial element of the core. In such cases,
the verb occurs in the immediate post-core position. I discuss these contexts
below as non-canonical word orders because they are associated with marked
pragmatic contexts.",[282]

have family resemblances but may not cover exactly the same range of information types. For
example, established information may be variously called “given”, “old” (e.g., Chafe 1976), “ac-
cessible” (Ariel 1990), “thematic” (e.g., Firbas 1992), or “topic” (e.g., Lambrecht 1994). Less-
predictable information may be called “new” (e.g., Chafe 1976), “focus” (e.g., Lambrecht 1994;
É Kiss 1998), “pragmatically marked” (Payne 1992), “newsworthy” (Mithun 1992), “prominent”
(Choi 1999), “rheme” (Firbas 1992), and a range of other terms. See Baker and Mushin (2008)
for more on information packaging in Australian languages.
104 A systematic empirical study of Garrwa prosody is yet to be attempted but would be an
important part of the understanding of Garrwa information packaging.

            ‘My boss, (he) grew me up.’ (28.3.00.2.DG)In general, information that is less prominent occurs after the core. The second-
position pronoun and its associated clitics mark a boundary between more or
less prominent information. Second-position forms are never prominent in and
of themselves.
     In most cases, the core-initial constituents are also prosodically marked (e.g.,
stressed or in their own intonation unit), and there may be a systematic relation-
ship between the placement of prominent information in an initial slot and its
prosodic marking.
     The interaction between prosody and word order for the signalling of infor-
mation packaging is not simply a matter of stressing an initial-prominent word.
For example, it is not always the case that an initial form is also the most prosodi-
cally prominent, and factors such as the regular pattern of repeating intonation
contours in linked utterances will affect the ways that prosody is used to mark
information. This is seen in the following example, which is from an expository
text on bushtucker (Text 1 in Appendix A).(10.4)      “yangka      ngamba          balba  munganawa”

                            Information packaging and the marking of prominence             303
In (10.4), the speaker constructs a dialogue (a question/answer sequence), fol-
lowed by the continuation of her exposition. The question asks for the direction
to which the group will travel the next day. As expected, the information that
corresponds to the question’s direct answer is in core-initial position (i.e., kula
‘south’ as an answer to yangka ‘which way’). While kula bears some features of
prosodic prominence (it is relatively high and intense by virtue of being the first
item in the intonation unit), it is the final word nganbi-nyi ‘lilyroot-dat’ that bears
the primary pitch accent for this utterance because it is longer and slightly higher
and louder. While this information was not directly part of the question, it is pro-
viding further new information that is of principle concern to the group – the
purpose of the expedition is not just to go south, but also to collect food such as
nganbi. Indeed, nganbi is repeated as the first word in the next utterance after a
gap of over five seconds, and followed by the clausal core. Here, nganbi is also the
most prosodically marked word, and, although it is no longer new information,
it links the return to exposition back to the information in the constructed quote.
      This one example is given to illustrate how prosody and word order may work
together to facilitate the flow of information in discourse.","[319, 320, 321]"
"102 There are many aspects of Garrwa discourse that I do not include in this grammar, but
which would ideally be relevant to a chapter on discourse-related phenomena. These include a
detailed analysis of the discourse functions of prosody, and the ways in which Garrwa speakers
organize utterances into larger structures, such as conversational sequences. Some work on
Garrwa conversation has been published elsewhere (e.g., Gardner and Mushin 2007; Mushin
and Gardner 2009, 2011; Gardner 2010).

10.1.1 Prosody and word orderLike most languages, prominence in Garrwa is perhaps most saliently and iconi-
callymarked through prosody. Prominent information tends to be more stressed,
louder, and at the boundaries of intonation units, including in its own intona-
tion unit.¹⁰⁴ Prominence is also signalled by word order. The information pack-
aging properties of word order are described in detail in §9.4. To summarize that
section, information that is an answer to an information question and construed
as contrastive or highly emphatic is found in the initial position of the core of
Garrwa clauses, which (10.1) and (10.2) illustrate.","[318, 319]"
"3.2.4 Particles and cliticsGarrwa particles are identified as forms that do not take any additional suffixes,
inflectional or otherwise. Forms of this type exhibit a range of grammatical func-
tions that includes adverbial-like clausal modification (§8.2), location (§6.2.3),
clause combining (§8.3), negation (§9.5.1), and a range of functions associated
with discourse organization and talk-in-interaction (Chapter 10). Some particles
typically occur utterance initially (e.g., baki ‘and’ (§8.3.1)), some typically utter-
ance finally (e.g., junu ‘perhaps’ (§8.2.5)), while others occur in second position
(e.g., kuna ‘question’ (§8.1.2.5)). Particles that occur in utterance-medial posi-
tions are usually weakly cliticized to the preceding word. I consistently represent
particles as independent words in this grammar in the interests of consistency.
Garrwa speakers treat them as independent words.
     Garrwa clitics are always prosodically dependent on the preceding word, and
speakers do not typically treat them as independent words. Most clitics occur in
second position as part of the second-position clitic cluster within the core of the
Garrwa clause (§9.3.1). These include: tense and aspect markers (e.g., =yi ‘past’,
=yili ‘habitual’, =ngka ‘present’, and =ja= ‘future’ (§8.1.1)) and modal markers
(e.g., =kiyi ‘imperative (§8.1.2.1) and =wali ‘evidential’ (§8.1.2.4). Examples (3.16)
to (3.21) below illustrate these.(3.16)     yanyba=yi       ngayu         all day     wulani

          ‘That snake might be alive.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)As noted in §3.2.3.1 above, Garrwa pronouns are typically found as part of the
second-position clitic complex. As with particles, I consistently write them as
separate words, although it is clear that pronouns in the second position are
phonetically dependent on the preceding word in discourse. Modal clitics always
directly attach to the word in core-initial position. The examples above have tense
or aspect clitics attached to the second-position pronoun. However, as Mushin
(2008) and §8.1.1 of this book discuss, tense and aspect clitics can also directly
attach to the core-initial word and can precede the pronoun, which (3.22) illus-
trates with the past tense clitic =yi (=i when attached to pronouns).(3.22)    a.     wilku=yi      ngayu        baki    jilajba=yi      ngayu

4 Nouns
Garrwa nouns are formally identified by morphological processes specifically
associated with this word class. Case marking is the most frequent and salient
morphology associated with nouns. Nouns form a large open class with many
subclasses (not all of which are themselves open-class categories). Noun sub-
classes are identified on the basis of their distribution, meaning, and case allo-
morphy. In this chapter, I describe the morphological and distributional proper-
ties of common and proper nouns, kin terms, and quantifying nouns. I describe
interrogative words, which mostly pattern with nouns, in Chapter 6.
     Common nouns cover a large range of semantic types that includes words
referring to people, animate and inanimate natural objects, man-made objects,
and qualities of objects. Unlike many languages in this region, Garrwa has no
grammatical system of noun classification. There is also no verbal agreement or
obligatory pronominal cross-referencing. These are all common morphological
strategies among Australian languages for identifying referents and maintain-
ing reference in discourse. In this context, Garrwa looks morphologically poor,
but Garrwa speakers have various strategies to establish and maintain reference,
such as choosing the referring expression (e.g., noun vs. pronoun vs. zero) and/
or the word order.","[60, 61, 62]"
"10.1.2 The ‘prior information’ particle barriThe particle barri, here glossed as ‘pi’ or ‘prior information’, is a discourse-fre-
quent form whose meaning is clearly associated with the organization of dis-
course rather than the propositional content of utterances.¹⁰⁶ Generally, barri has
scope over the information that precedes it (usually the word that precedes it),
and operates in conjunction with word order and prosody to signal the status
of information being expressed. While the precise pragmatic properties of barri
have yet to be completely solved, its principle function appears to be to link infor-
mation under its scope with prior information. Such prior information may be
mentioned earlier in the same discourse, or may constitute shared information
with the interlocutor. Barri frequently occurs following the distal demonstrative
nanda, which supports its analysis as a type of anaphoric discourse marker. For
106 Barri was originally analysed as a hesitation marker (e.g., like English um) in Furby and
Furby (1977) and Belfrage (1992), perhaps due to its seemingly flexible distribution within
clauses. However, it has no properties of true hesitation markers. Kirton and Charlie (1996)
analyse the similar Yanyuwa particle barra as a focus particle.
304         Discourse phenomenathis reason, I do not analyse barri as a focus marker as Kirton and Charlie (1996)
do for the related Yanyuwa particle barra.¹⁰⁷
     Barri is, therefore, a resource that speakers may use to point to the connect-
edness of information. Its use may draw attention to the information under its
scope, but its primary function is not to mark information as new, contrastive,
or emphatic. It frequently occurs when repeating, reformulating, or elaborating
on information already mentioned in prior talk. It is never used to introduce new
topical referents. Barri occurs more frequently in explanations, accounts, story-
telling, and answers, which are all speech activities for which making connec-
tions to prior information is highly relevant. Example (10.5) illustrates a typical
use of barri in a storytelling context.","[321, 322]"
"In this section, I consider whether Garrwa pronouns are bound or free forms, or
somewhere in between. In general, free pronouns have the status of independ-
ent words and are often treated grammatically as a subtype of nominal. Bound
pronouns include affixes that usually attach to verbs and/or clitics, which may be
                                        Are Garrwa pronouns free, bound, or both?              109
positional and which may or may not constitute part of an auxiliary constituent.
The status of Garrwa pronouns compared with pronominal types in other Austral-
ian languages has been discussed in Mushin (2006) and Simpson and Mushin
(2008), and this section expands on the analysis developed in those papers.
Dixon (2002) analyses Garrwa as a language that lacks bound pronouns, but
which has, perhaps, some incipient signs of developing bound pronouns through
the compound pronoun forms. While the compound pronouns do indeed bind
pronouns to each other, this is not the same as bound pronouns as a category of
pronoun that must itself be attached to another word or constituent.
     In a number of Australian languages, bound pronouns are transparently
derived from free forms (e.g., Wambaya (Nordlinger 1998)), which usually
includes a systematic reduction in form. In Garrwa, while there are some clear
contexts in which forms may be reduced, as a class, these reduced forms do not
appear to form a distinct paradigm on distributional grounds. This is evidence
against the analysis of Garrwa pronouns as having a free set and a bound set
(what Mushin and Simpson (2008) call “dual systems”), and I have maintained
the treatment of Garrwa pronouns as a single class. It is for this reason that I
have represented pronouns as independent words in all example sentences, even
when they prosodically and positionally seem to behave more like clitics than
independent words.
     Almost all tokens of core argument pronouns in both elicited and text exam-
ples occur as the second element in what I call the clause’s core (see §9.3.1).³⁸
Second position is the default or unmarked position for Garrwa pronouns. When
they are in second position, pronouns are always non-stressed and may be ana-
lysed as cliticized to the preceding constituent.³⁹ Often, this preceding constitu-
ent is a verb (which (5.109) and (5.110) illustrates), but, as examples (5.111) and
(5.112) illustrate, when verbs do not occur in initial position, such as in interroga-
tive and negative contexts, the pronoun remains in second position. This is evi-
dence that the pronoun is attracted to second position rather than to the class of
verb.(5.109)     wudumba=yi      narri     mani        wulani
            get=past        2plnom money day.before
            ‘You all got money yesterday.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)
38 Analysis of word order in a corpus of over 300 clauses in narrative texts found that over
90% of pronouns occurred in second position.
39 The exact phonetic properties of such cliticization are the subject of future research.

          neg    1plexclnom=hab eat-neg             cow
          ‘We didn’t used to eat beef.’ (2.5.01.1.KS)The default second position slot for pronouns can be characterized as the place
where pronouns are found when they are being used to signal the person,
number, or role features of the referent in question when there is no particular
focus on these features. This could be because the referent is well established in
the discourse or in the situational contexts, or because other information in the
clause is being highlighted in some way.
     When the discourse or situational context does motivate the pronoun’s high-
lighting, it occurs in initial position. Initial pronouns only occur in contexts of
emphasis or contrast. In such cases, they are intonationally set off from the rest
of the clause. For example, in (5.113), the initial pronoun yalu occurs prior to the
normally initial conjunction jali. In this part of the conversation, KS contrasts
what she and others were doing (i.e., putting paperbark on a wagon) with what
her cousins (and perhaps others) were doing (i.e., getting bark off the tree).(5.113)   bankijba nurr=i                 naja,        yarrijba       waykinyi-na,
          get.bark 1plExclnom=past paperbark put                      wagon-loc

          ‘They got the bark off the tree, cousin (did).’ (3.9.03.4.KS)In (5.114), which is from a traditional narrative text, the protagonist is a man
chasing a couple (one of whom is his younger brother and one of whom is his

wife). He has just been told by another man has just told him where the eloping
couple have run to. At this point, the action shifts to the angered dupe as he waits
to kill them. The initial third person singular pronoun nyulu helps to signal the
shift in narrative from the previous episode (which was focused on finding out
where the elopers had escaped to) to this new episode that is centrally focused on
the actions of the protagonist. The use of the intensifier =mili also highlights the
wronged man as the central figure of this narrative episode. In the next clause in
this episode, the third person singular pronoun reverts to second position (here
following the verb), which signals a continuity of focus on the wronged man.(5.114)     nyul=i           mili      jilajba nana-nkurri-wa,
            3sgnom=past      intens walk         that-all-dir

            hide=past        3sgrefl             3du-dat
            ‘He came right up to them. He hid himself from them.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)Examples (5.113) and (5.114) illustrate the use of an initial pronoun in a pragmati-
cally marked context. In such contexts, there is no second-position pronoun; one
pronoun is sufficient here. This reinforces the analysis that Garrwa only has one
set of pronouns because languages with free and bound pronouns usually require
a bound pronoun form when a free pronoun is used.
     There are some contexts where an initial pronoun and a second-position
pronoun co-occur in the same clause. These are also in contexts where the initial
pronoun is emphasized. In (5.115), the initial pronoun is prosodically prominent
compared with the second position pronoun. In (5.116), the initial pronoun is in
its own prosodic unit, which supports a left-dislocation analysis.⁴⁰ The prosodic
separation of initial pronouns when there is a second-position pronoun in the
clause is also consistent with the analysis that Garrwa has one set of pronouns.(5.115)     ngayu       wudumba ngayu            wawarra na
            1sgnom get                1sgnom child
            ‘Me, I (finally) got kids.’ (The speaker is contrasting herself with other
            women in a community who had had children earlier) (10.9.03.3.TD)
40 There may well be some systematic differences in the kinds of prominent contexts that
lead to the doubling of pronouns, but this will require more analysis of the contexts for initial
pronouns than I am able to provide here.

ond-position clitic phenomena, especially tense, aspect, and modality marking
(details of these are given in Chapter 8). A number of these clitics always attach
directly to the word in initial position, and precede what I call second-position
pronouns. The pronoun directly follows this clitic. This is illustrated in (5.117)
with the imperative clitic =kiyi (§8.1.2.1), in (5.118) with the hortative clitic =nyi
(§8.1.2.3), and in (5.119) with the obligation clitic =kiya (§8.1.2.2).(5.117)    yanyba=kiyi ninji         mada ngurujba ngayu              yanybi-kanyi

           ‘I didn’t get to eat turtle.’ (impl. ‘even though I wanted to eat turtle’)
           (20.6.08.KS)Unlike the modal clitics, which are fixed in their position, tense/aspect clitics
vary according to whether they attach to the initial constituent that precedes
the pronoun, or whether they attach to the second-position pronoun. Examples
(5.120) to (5.123), which are from the same text, illustrate these variations with
the past tense clitic =(y)i. In (5.120), the clitic =yi attaches to the second-posi-
tion pronoun; in (5.121), it attaches to the initial verb and precedes the pronoun.
Examples (5.122) and (5.123) provide similar contrasting examples for the habitual
clitic =yili.

ated with second position in the clause’s core. This feature makes Garrwa clause
structure look somewhat similar to Australian languages that have auxiliaries
– clusters of clitics (not necessarily in second position) that combine informa-
tion about core arguments (i.e., bound pronouns) with tense, aspect, or modal
information. Examples of such languages include Warlpiri (Laughren 2002b),
Wambaya (Nordlinger 1998), and Gurindji (McConvell 1996). I do not analyse
forms in Garrwa second position as forming an auxiliary because of the consider-
able flexibility in the placement of tense/aspect clitics before or after pronouns.
It seems more true to the language to analyse pronouns and tense/aspect, and
modal marking as separate types of second-position phenomena. While second-
position pronouns are prosodically dependent on the preceding constituent, they
may also occur as free forms. The same cannot be said of tense/aspect and modal
marking, which must always be cliticized to the preceding constituent.
6 Demonstratives, directionals,
  and interrogatives
This chapter mostly describes forms whose primary function is to pick out entities
and locations in space: demonstrative, direction, and location words, words used
to ask information questions, and constructions associated with temporal refer-
ence. Many of the forms described in this chapter share some features with nouns
but differ enough in their inflectional possibilities and in their distribution in sen-
tences for them to be classified as a different word class from nouns. Like nouns,
however, demonstratives form part of the system of reference, and can combine
with nouns in nominal groups (see §9.1). Therefore, they share inflectional fea-
tures with nouns. Location and direction words generally function as adjuncts in
clauses to signal aspects of spatial orientation. Their inflectional properties are
restricted to grammatical meanings associated with spatial orientation, and they
pattern quite differently from nouns. Demonstratives, directionals, and inter-
rogatives each form a small closed class based on their distinct morphosyntactic
behaviour. There are also a number of location words and temporal words that
pattern more like particles.","[126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132]"

98 The flexibility of main clause types with subsequential forms may be because, unlike the
other types, the focus of the relationship between main and subordinate clause is aspectual –
that is, with the subordinate clause indicating the endpoint of the event denoted in the main
clause. Further work is required to determine the full range of relationships between main
clauses and their participial complements.
99 There are a number of homophonous -wa suffixes, including the continuative (usually
translated as ‘still’) morpheme, which attaches to verbs, and a directional morpheme, which
attaches to demonstratives and some locational words. While it is more likely that the -wa in
-jiwa originated from the directional morpheme, more work is required to fully understand its
development as a participial form.
290        SyntaxIn many cases, however, dependent clauses also include complements, mostly
direct and oblique objects, as well as adjuncts. For purposive, subsequential, and
same-subject clauses, the subject of the main and dependent clause is the same
so there is no expressed subject in the dependent clause. For the different subject
and irrealis clauses, the subject of the dependent clause corresponds with the
direct object of the main clause.
     As the examples below illustrate, dependent clauses always occur at the right
periphery of the sentence. They may occur following an intonation break (which
(9.135), (9.136), and (9.138) illustrate), although it is far more common to find such
clauses in an intonation unit. Dependent clauses in Garrwa clearly share prop-
erties with what have been described as subordinate clauses in other Austral-
ian languages (most clearly articulated for Wambaya in Nordlinger (2006)). The
simultaneous-same and different-subject clauses also share features with Hale’s
(1976) description of the “adjoined relative” clause to the extent that they may
be interpreted as NP modifying (relative) or as an adverbial clause. For example,
(9.142) may be translated as ‘I heard my baby who was crying’ or ‘I heard my baby
while it was crying’. The extent to which Garrwa dependent clauses are similar or
different from other Australian languages remains to be seen.","[307, 308]"

           notes)It is only in third person singular contexts, where the subject is represented
by a full noun or nominal group, that there may be no pronoun (which (8.181)
illustrates). However, it is not uncommon for the third person singular subject
pronoun nyulu to follow ngala, which (8.182) and (8.183) illustrate. This use is
consistent with the analysis that nyulu is an emphatic pronoun (§5.1)(8.181)    nguwalili      jungku=yi nyulu       Kumunjurr       ngala yakal

           ‘Those two arrived over there while he was hanging up there (in a

tion as the following examples with =kiyi ‘directive’ and =yili ‘habitual’ attest.
These are the only clitics that directly attach to ngala in the corpus; therefore,
it may be that this is the extent to which modal and TA clitics attach directly to
ngala. Note that, in all of these cases, ngala occurs utterance initially, and there is
no pronoun in the ngala-marked clause.

          ‘But that boy would just sit there, looking at her.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)The different contexts in which ngala can be used are summarized below.a) Temporal contexts
Ngala can indicate that one event involving one set of participants occurs at the
same time as another event involving a different set of participants. In these con-
texts it is usually translated as ‘while’. It is often used in narratives to contrast
what two different (sets of) characters are doing at the same narrative time. In
such clauses there is never any tense marking in the ngala-marked clause as it
inherits its temporal reading from the previous clause. Pronouns always occur
directly following ngala in these contexts.(8.187)   yundijba     bul=i          munga-na,      ngala nurru

          contr       1plInclnom
          ‘Those two kicked that old man, WD, while we were out bush.’
          (9.10.03.1.TD)Ngala can also establish the time that an event or situation occurred relative to
another situation while maintaining the same participant. It is often translated as
‘when’ in these circumstances, although ‘while’ may also be appropriate.(8.190)   buluki     nurr=ili              majirrimba, nana-wa, ngala

          (before I had children).’ (25.8.03.1.ER)(8.191)   najba=yi,    ngala nyulu        waydbala-na       barri

          waki-nyi
          work-irr
          ‘He saw them while he was working for the white man.’ (3.0.03.3.KS)b) Contrastive contexts
Ngala can also indicate that the event in question is in contrast with what has
already been said with no implications of relative temporal organisation. In such
cases, ngala is usually translated as ‘but’. In these cases, it is common for the
ngala-marked clause to maintain the word order of an independent clause. This
is the main formal difference between ngala clauses with a temporal implication
and ngala clauses without a temporal implication. It is perhaps iconic of the inde-
pendence of the connected clauses.
     In (8.192), which is from a narrative, the contrasted clause has verb+pronoun
order. In this example, there is a clear contrast between what the people in the
story did not do with a character’s corpse (i.e., bury it in the ground) and what
they did do with it (i.e., they hung it up in a tree).

           ‘They didn’t bury him, (rather) they hung him up.’ (3.9.03.KS)In (8.191), which is from a conversation, the speaker claims not to have heard
anything despite the fact that her grandson was in the house with her at the time.(8.193)    miku       ngay=i           manku anything ngala

           ‘I didn’t hear anything but my grandson was there.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)In (8.194), which is from a conversation, the speakers are discussing the cultural
knowledge of central Australian communities (where kids still speak traditional
language and ceremony life is strong) relative to Robinson River, where kids don’t
speak Garrwa and ceremony life is seen as less strong.(8.194)    ngala      kajurra   barri yalu         baki miku yalu
           contr      dance     pi      3plnom and neg            3plnom

           ‘But they dance and they don’t mess it up, those old women.’ (20.6.08.
           KS)c) In quotation
Thirdly, ngala can signal deictic shifts between narration and direct speech in
storytelling. In such cases, ngala introduces direct speech without a speech verb
to function like a quotative marker. It is immediately followed by the content of
direct speech. The direct speech itself is signalled by deictic shifts and changes
in voice quality. It is clear in such contexts that ngala is outside of the clause con-
taining represented speech. It is usually de-stressed, and any clauses within this
quote have their canonical structure. For example, the pronoun never directly
follows ngala in such contexts. This quotative function is clearly related to other
contrastive functions because it contrasts what one reported speaker says with
either another reported speaker (in constructed dialogue) or with description of
narrative events.

her grandfather if they are staying in their current location overnight. Her grand-
father answers to the contrary, and the direct speech introduction clause (which
is not speech itself) is marked with ngala. Note that the ngala-marked clause here
takes tense marking (yanyba=yi), perhaps to reinforce the deictic shift from one
speech event in the narrative to another.","[262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267]"

morphological features of kinship nouns.
     The suffix -nganja can attach productively to kin terms to indicate an ana-
phoric prepositus (anaph), which is co-referential with any prepositus referent
regardless of person or number.²¹ It is only used with kinship nouns. Examples
(4.6) to (4.9) show that nganja can occur on third and first person pronouns.(4.6)       badibadi-yurru,    ngaki-nkurru        ngada-nganja-rru
            old.woman-dec      1sgdat-dec          M-anaph-dec
            ‘That old woman my mother.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)(4.7)       nayi=li       yalu         yingijba    na-nkanyi      nanga-ngi
            this=hab      3plnom       leave       that-dat       3sg-dat
            ngada-nganja
            M-anaph
            ‘They used to leave that one (HG), her mother behind.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)(4.8)       karu=yi        ngayu        ngaki       bawa-nganja
            tell=past      1sgnom       1sgdat      eB-anaph
            ‘I told my older brother…’ (Belfrage Field 1991 notes)
21 This suffix is also used productively in Waanyi. I am grateful to the anonymous reviewer for
clarifying the analysis of -nganja as a general anaphoric suffix.
                                                               Kinship nouns       51
(4.9)      juka-wanyi     albimba=yi        nanga-ngi         bawa-nganja
           boy-erg        help=past         3sg-dat           eB-anaph
           ‘The boy helped his older brother.’ (Belfrage field notes 1991)If there is no pronoun, the prepositus is unspecified. For example, in (4.10),
the mothers are mothers of goats within a herd of goats. In (4.11), which is the
opening utterance of an elicited narrative, the mother turns out to be the mother
of the main character, but this is not yet specified (note the translation as ‘mother’
rather than ‘his mother’).(4.10)     yarrijba kudiya-mba           kidikidi nayi, ngada-nganja nayi,
           put         some-class1       kid      this     M-anaph           this
           munganawanyja
           until.next.day
           ‘Put half the goats – kids here, mothers here (in a different place) until
           tomorrow morning.’ (8.9.10.TD)(4.11)     ngada-nganja, kuluka=yi
           M-anaph          sleep=past
           ‘Mother was sleeping.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)As they are used to clarify reference to the prepositus, forms with -nganja are
common in discourse. Kinship nouns that lack both -nganja and a specifying
dative pronoun are interpreted as having a first person prepositus (‘my X’).(4.12)     yingamali yal=i               wudumba-yi         maju-yurru
           one          3plnom=past      get=past           eZ-dec
           badibadi-yurru
           old.woman-dec
           ‘They got one – my deceased older sister.’ (16.5.00.1.KS)(4.13)     ngaki-nmuku=yili yalu,       jila  nayi, kawuja-rru Nyanja
           1sgdat-pl=hab      3plnom walk this        FZ-dec       Name
           ‘All this mob of mine used to come, (including) my aunt Nyanja.’
           (3.9.03.4.KS)This suffix is not entirely productive as some forms are never found with -nganja
(e.g., kukudi ‘MM’ and kangku ‘FF’), while others only ever occur with the -nganja
suffix.

marked) pronouns with the kin term (with or without -nganja) to indicate the pos-
sessor, or a derived verb form of the kin term (using class 1 verb morphology – see
§7.1.1), with a pronominal possessor in nominative case. This construction has
the semblance of a predicate+subject structure, although it is clearly used in dis-
course exclusively to attribute a kin term to its possessor. This is clearly shown in
(4.15) where the nominal referent “Lobby” is ergatively marked (as the transitive
subject of the clause), but there is no equivalent or comparable inflection in the

other languages of the region (e.g., Wambaya).

put these together under elicitation conditions to form higher numbers: kujarra
yingamali ‘three’, kujarra baki kujarra ‘four’ (lit. ‘two and two’), kujarra kujarra
baki yingamali ‘five’ (lit. ‘two, two, and one’), and so on. The form murrku may
also be used to refer to small quantities (three, four, or five). Speakers tend to
translate murrku as ‘three’ when asked, but it is more common for the precise
number ‘three’ to be designated by combining kujarra and yingamali in discourse.(4.19)    nayi     kujarra, ngarrkadaba nungka                  bula-nya

54       NounsAs (4.22) illustrates, the suffix -ka is only found attached to kujarra and murrku
to mean ‘two nights’ and ‘three nights’, respectively. It does not attach to other
quantifying nouns.
     Besides numerals, there are a number of other quantifying nominals. These
include: kaja ‘many’, kudiya ‘some’, and yingka ‘another’. Kaja denotes a quan-
tity larger than murrku ‘three’. Kudiya denotes a proportion of a whole set (‘some
of X’). Yingka denotes a single referent different from aforementioned and is redu-
plicated for plural reference. These quantifying nominals can occur alone or in
nominal groups.(4.23)    wijkunumba=yi     yalu       kaja        nyinbu

          (3.9.03.3.KS)4.4 Nominal case-markingCase marking morphology largely functions to mark the role a nominal or group
of nouns plays in a clause. Furby and Furby (1977) identify seven cases: “erga-
tive”, “accusative”, “referent” (= “dative”), “locative”, “allative”, “ablative”, and
“translocative”. The morphological and semantic properties of these cases are
discussed in §4.4.1 to §4.4.6. There are some grounds for treating the associative
or having suffix -yudi (§4.5.1) as a case marker because it also indicates the role a
nominal plays in its clause. However, it is classified here among “other nominal
morphology” (§4.5) for reasons discussed below.
     In terms of the system of core case-marking, Garrwa has a split ergative
system. All nominal types except pronouns (i.e., demonstratives, interrogatives,
                                                        Nominal case-marking     57
kin terms, quantifier nominals, and common nouns) mark transitive subjects (A)
with an ergative suffix, while intransitive subjects (S) and transitive objects (O)
are not marked (absolutive). All pronouns mark transitive objects with an accusa-
tive suffix, but leave transitive and intransitive subjects unmarked (nominative),
which Table 7 illustrates.","[67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75]"
"9.3.1 The clausal coreThe core of Garrwa sentences is the minimal obligatory component of a main
clause. The core component includes an initial position and a second position.
The initial constituent is canonically a verb, but can also be an interrogative or
negative or contrastive particle, or some pragmatically marked or prominent con-
stituent (see below). This structural and language-specific definition thus differs
from the Role and Reference Grammar (RRG) characterization of a clausal core
as a predicate plus its arguments (e.g., Van Valin and LaPolla 1997: 26). Many
Garrwa cores are in fact predicates plus their arguments, but they need not be.
For example, I have not included the position that immediately follows second
position as part of the Garrwa core, even though arguments frequently occupy
this position, and main verbs may also occur there (§9.4.2).
                                                                    Simple sentences           265
Initial position in the core does not necessarily correspond with initial position in
an utterance. This is represented in the template above, and is illustrated by the
following examples (the core of each case is in boldface). In (9.39), two different
types of particles precede the core: the co-ordinating particle baki ‘and’ (§8.3.1),
and the modifying particle muningka ‘anyway’, which is used to indicate that the
speaker has finished with what was said prior and is ready to move on to the next
thing (which may be a repetition of earlier information) (§8.2.2).(9.39)      baki   muningka daba=yili        barri
            and    anyway      fight=hab     pi
            ‘And anyway (he) would fight (him).’ (8.8.03.1.TD)In the next two examples, a locative adjunct (9.40) and a left-dislocated subject
(9.41) precedes the core. In both cases, the preceding linguistic material is set off
by intonation or by the particle barri.(9.40)      nana-ba    barri jungku=yili nurru
            that-deic pi       sit=hab          1plExclnom
            ‘There we would stay.’ (4.5.01.1.TD)(9.41)      biliki-yurru,  baki    maju ngaki,         balba bul=i
            MyZ-dec        and     eZ       1sgdat     go          3dunom=past
            munga-na
            night-loc
            ‘Aunty and my older sister, they went at night.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)The second position of the core minimally includes either a TAM clitic or a
pronoun, although cores frequently include both. There is some variation of order-
ing in the second position but not between initial and second position.⁸⁶ Modal
clitics, if they occur, always immediately follow this initial constituent, which
is subsequently followed by a pronoun (nominative, accusative, or compound).
Tense/aspect clitics either immediately follow the initial constituent or follow the
second-position pronoun (see §8.1 for more discussion of the attachment possi-
bilities of the tense/aspect clitics). The core’s second position thus constitutes
86 The future marker =ja= may itself be part of the core-initial constituent when it is proclitic
to an initial pronoun, but it is usually part of the second position in the core as proclitic to a
second-position pronoun or as enclitic to a core-initial verb.
266          Syntaxthe main packaging of grammatical information: person, number, and syntactic
function of the core argument referents; temporal deixis; and modal categories.⁸⁷
    Table 23 represents the core’s structure.","[282, 283, 284]"
"5.3.2 Reduction of first person singular pronounsThe first person singular nominative ngayu is frequently reduced to nga when
it follows the future marker ja (e.g., ja=ngayu ~ ja=nga). The reduced form also
occurs in pronominal compounds (§5.4). Other reductions are less systematic,
although they do occur in connected speech (e.g., 2sgnom ninji ~ ninj).(5.46)    jibililijba  ja=nga         nani           larrbalarrba
          smoke        fut=1sgnom like.that          pipe
          ‘I’m going to smoke that pipe.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)5.4 Compound pronounsGarrwa compound pronouns combine accusative + nominative pronouns into a
single-word form that represents the human subject and object of a transitive
construction. They only occur when both the subject and the object in the transi-
tive construction are human referents. The accusative form of the pronoun occurs
first in this combination, and this inverts the canonical ordering of free pronomi-
nal arguments in which nominative pronouns normally precede accusative pro-
nouns. Compound pronouns have the same distributional properties as single
free pronouns in clauses, which mostly occur in second position but are also able
to occur initially under certain pragmatic contexts.
     The compounded forms are quite restricted in the possible person and number
categories that may combine in this structure. Consistent with the limited use of
nyulu’s third person singular nominative form and the absence of a third person
singular accusative form of the word, third person singular forms are not repre-
94        Pronounssented at all. First person nominative forms are never compounded, and second
person nominative forms are only compounded in combination with first person
singular accusative forms. Accusative non-singular pronouns for all persons are
represented in compounds, but there are clear restrictions on singular forms
(especially for first and second person). First person singular accusative forms
only combine with second person forms (all number categories). Second person
singular accusative forms only combine with first person singular nominative
forms, as well as with third person non-singular forms. Table 12 represents the
possible combinations. Logically impossible combinations (i.e., ones that would
result in reflexive readings) are shaded. Combinations of third person non-singu-
lar forms acting on third person non-singular forms can only have non-reciprocal
meanings. There are no attested compounds representing second person forms
acting on second person forms.","[111, 112]"
"
Reflexive/reciprocal pronouns are found exclusively in second position and, like
other pronouns, they may attract tense or aspect clitics. They are unmarked for
case. They are used in a range of contexts associated with low transitivity. These
are described as follows:a) Reflexive/reciprocal pronouns can occur as the subjects of (normally) transitive
verbs. In such reflexive contexts, the use of the reflexive changes the argument
structure from a transitive ergative/absolutive pattern or from a semi-transitive
nominative/dative pattern to an intransitive nominative-only pattern. This is seen
in (5.65), where the postposed nominals Garrwa baki Yanyula ‘Garrwa (people)
and Yanyuwa (people)’ would be expected to take ergative case marking, which is
consistent with the transitive verb daba ‘fight’ (example (5.66) illustrates the use
of ergative in a non-reflexive context). A similar example is given with the verb
burradaba ‘knock down’, which, when used transitively (which (5.67) illustrates),
refers to the act of pushing someone or something over. With a reflexive or recipro-
cal pronoun, burradaba can refer to people pushing each other over (which (5.68)
illustrates), or, more idiomatically, to being exhausted (i.e., to knock oneself over
from tiredness), which (5.69) illustrates. Similarly, janyba ‘throw’ becomes ‘die’
when it occurs with reflexive pronoun, which (5.70) illustrates.

These seems to all have reflexive meanings (‘do X to oneself’) rather than recipro-
cal meanings. They may also take oblique (dative) arguments. Examples (5.74)

          1991 field notes)5.6 Co-occurrence of pronouns and nounsThere are some contexts where pronouns always occur with co-referential nouns,
some where they are optional, and some where pronouns and nouns never co-
occur. The following analysis only applies to nominative and accusative pro-
nouns.a) Third person singular pronouns rarely occur when there is a co-referential
nominal in the clause. As noted in §5.1, there is no third person singular accusative
form, and the third person singular nominative form is only found in emphatic
and contrastive contexts. The following examples illustrate the lack of pronouns
in third person singular contexts.(5.80)    ngarajba=ngka wabuda na-nyini           bukubuku-wanyi
          drink=pres        water      this-erg   pigeon-erg

          spear=past        kangaroo man-erg
          ‘The man speared the kangaroo.’ (Mushin 2000 field notes)b) Third person non-singular subject pronouns 3dunom bula and 3plnom yalu
usually co-occur with co-referential nouns. Examples (5.82) to (5.85) illustrate the
pronoun’s co-occurrence with number marking on the noun. Number marking
is indicated either through the suffixes -wuya ‘dual’ and -muku ‘plural’ (§4.6), or
through partial reduplication. In almost all discourse examples, the co-referen-
tial nouns are in different prosodic units and often in right-dislocated positions,
which (5.82) and (5.85) illustrate. Examples (5.83) and (5.84) illustrate the use of
an initial nominal with a subsequent pronoun where there is no right dislocation,
although (5.84) additionally has a right-dislocated co-referential nominal.(5.82)    dabarraba=yili        yalu,       badidibadi-wanyi
          cook.in.ashes=hab     3plnom old.woman(redup)-erg

          ‘They used to feed the chooks, the kids (would).’ (28.3.00.3.TD)While there is a clear preference, especially when the referent is human, for non-
singular (referential) nominals and pronouns to co-occur, it is not obligatory.
Examples (5.86) and (5.87) illustrate the occurrence of non-singular nominals in
the absence of non-singular pronouns, but the non-singularity of the referents is
clear from the context.(5.86)    nanda barri      jungku=yi wayka nana-mungkuji bakunyi
          that      pi     sit=past down         that-origin      later
          ‘Those countrymen sat down again till later.’ (Furby and Furby 1977:
          4.1.2.29)(5.87)    wanjirr nanda yirrba=ngka kula-rra                  kunda-nanyi

          ‘Those leaves are falling off the tree over there (to the south).’ (Mushin
          2000 field notes)c) Third person non-singular object nominals also frequently co-occur with third
person non-singular accusatives, especially if the referent is human. Example
(5.88) illustrates the use of the plural noun birijina-muku that is co-referential
with the accusative component of a compound pronoun (§5.4). Where a noun and
an accusative non-compound pronoun co-occur, the pronoun occurs adjacent
to the nominal and most often follows it, which (5.89) and (5.90) illustrate, but
sometimes precedes it, which (5.91) and (5.92) illustrate.

          ‘You all watch those kids properly.’ (4.5.01.3.DG)There are also examples where a non-singular object noun occurs without a cor-
responding pronoun in the same clause. These are mostly, but not only, cases
where the object is non-human. In most examples, the non-singularity of the ref-
erent is inferred from context rather than marked. Recall that only human refer-
ents can take number marking on nominals.(5.93)    jikuwarra     ngay=i            najba kujarra walkurra-wuya

          ‘We’re going to tell our kids.’ (16.4.00.1.KS)d) Nouns that occur in reflexive/reciprocal contexts require a reflexive/recipro-
cal pronoun in the same clause (see §5.5 above for a full description of reflexive/
reciprocal marking).(5.97)    ngala      daba yalu-ngka nganinyi-muku                  wayka

          ‘The tree went up in the air.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)e) The inclusory construction (Singer 2001) involves the use of a (usually) first
person dual or plural pronoun combined with a nominal referent (often a kin
term or proper name) to indicate that the nominal referent is included in the set
of referents demarcated by the pronoun.(5.100)   nurru          mili        jila=yi     kula    kujba=ya

with pronouns.(5.105)     nala-na      luwanja=kili            wankala-wanyi nala-na

or nouns. Both do not occur in the same clause. Example (5.108) contains adja-
cent lines from the same narrative text. In the first clause, the oblique argument
of the verb ngadijba ‘hide (from)’ is represented by the third person singular
36 This example looks like self-repair. The speaker starts with a singular referent but then
shifts to dual to indicate that she and her husband were sleeping.
37 It is unclear whether this example is really an inclusory construction because both KS’s
father and her father’s brother are called wulukanja ‘father’ in the Garrwa kinship system. The
use of the dual pronoun signals that two fathers are involved here. This could theoretically be
two of KS’s father’s brothers, but in this context is her father and his brother.
108       Pronounsdative pronoun nanga-ngi. In the second clause, the oblique argument of the verb
wajba ‘give’ is represented by a dative noun group kunyba-nyi wabuda-nyi ‘good-
dat water-dat’.(5.108)   ngala    bukaji-wanyi ngadijba=yi nanga-ngi,             wabuda

          ‘The hawks gave him good water.’ (11.5.01.1.KS)Overall, the co-occurrence of pronouns and co-referential nouns is quite infre-
quent in discourse. This is largely due to the predominance of first and second
person pronouns, which have no noun equivalents. In third person contexts, non-
singular nominal referents usually co-occur with pronouns, while third person
singular referents rarely have both pronoun and noun in the same clause (reflex-
ive/reciprocal pronouns are an exception). Where it is possible for a pronoun and
co-referential noun to co-occur, only one argument may do so. That is, it is only
possible for either the subject or the object to have such a double reference.
    Where subjects are doubly marked, the nominal occurs on the periphery of
the utterance, and sometimes in a different prosodic unit. In the same prosodic
unit, doubly marked objects occur adjacently in the clause’s core (§9.3.1). This
raises questions about the syntactic status of such nominals, especially whether
they or the pronoun has argument status in the clause. Given that pronominal
subjects are far more common than any other kind of referring expression, it
seems likely that it is they, rather than the nominal, that represents the subject
argument of the clause. The argument status of object nouns and pronouns is less
clear when they co-occur. Obliques are clearly represented by either pronouns or
nouns, but not both.","[118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126]"
"8.3.1 Baki ‘and’This form has a similar distribution to English and as a coordinator, so ‘and’ is its
gloss. It can conjoin noun phrases and clauses as well as larger discourse units.
It is a coordinator because it connects two independent clauses that can have TA
marking. Baki, when it occurs, often occurs initially after an intonation break
and attracts the TA marker =yili (which results in the form bakili). In narratives,
baki is usually used to connect temporally ordered clauses (‘X happened and then
Y happened’), but it can also connect two clauses that describe simultaneous
activities (‘X is happening and Y is happening’).",[257]
"It is unusual in texts to find two transitive arguments (subject and object) repre-
sented as pronouns, and so most compounds occur rarely in discourse. The most
common in the corpus are 1sgacc/2sgnom nganinji and 3placc/3plnom yaluny-
jalu. The compound pronoun forms are as follows.a) First person singular accusative+second person nominative
Forms that combine with a first person singular accusative have a truncated form
of the accusative pronoun ngana ~ nga. For combinations with second person
nominative, the form is nga+2nom. Nganinji ‘you X me’ is the most frequent form
in my own corpus.nga-ninji                                      1sgacc/2sgnom

          ‘First can you (all) tell me where the policeman is?’ (3.9.03.3.KS)b) Second person singular accusative + first person singular nominative
There is also the combination 2sgacc/1sgnom ninga (not the predicted
*ninyanga(yu)), which seems to combine the second person singular root ni-
with the regular short variant of the first person singular pronoun nga. The full
second person singular accusative pronoun is ninya, which also has the second
person singular root ni- with the accusative suffix –nya attached. Example (5.50)
illustrates the use of the non-compounded 2sgACC pronoun in combination with
a nominative pronoun. Ninga is the only compound pronoun that combines a
1sgnom pronoun.(5.49)    ja=ninga                 daba winyurru
          fut=2sgacc/1sgnom hit             soon

          ‘We’re teaching you.’ (11.8.03.1.TD)c) First person non-singular inclusive/exclusive + third person non-singular
First person non-singular accusative pronouns combine productively with third
person non-singular nominative pronouns to form compounds. There are no
attested examples of compounds that combine first person non-singular accusa-
tive with second person nominative pronouns. The forms of such compounds are
regular: for combinations with 3dunom, the full accusative pronoun plus accusa-
tive suffix occurs first in the compound, which is followed by an epenthetic /n/
(e.g., nurru-nya-n-bula ‘Those two X us (excl.)’); for combinations with 3plnom,
the accusative suffix -nya is shortened to –ny and no epenthetic consonant is
used. The initial glide consonant of the 3plnom pronoun yalu is strengthened to
96         Pronounsthe palatal stop /j/.³¹ The truncation of the accusative suffix in 3plnom contexts,
a process associated with a more advanced stage of grammaticalization, may
reflect a greater frequency of use of 3pl contexts compared with 3du contexts.³²niya-nya-n-bula                                  (1duInclacc/3dunom)

31 The use of -n- in these combinations is found in other languages of the Gulf area (e.g., Mara
(Heath 1981)). I am grateful to an anonymous reviewer for pointing this out.
32 A historical explanation suggested by an anonymous reviewer is that the -n- consonant
may lead to the hardening of the /y/ consonant to /j/ in 3plNOM yalu , followed by the loss of
the final /a/ in the accusative suffix and the simplification of the impossible /nyn/ cluster to /
ny/ (*nya-n-yalu > *nya-n-jalu > ny-jalu). This change is consistent with the observation that
3plNOM is far more frequent in discourse than 3duNOM because higher-frequency items are
typically subject to phonological processes of reduction more than lower-frequency items.

d) Second person accusative + third person non-singular nominative
Second person accusative also productively combines with third person non-
singular nominative. While the forms are predictable from the first person non-
singular forms, 2sgacc/3plnom ninyalu appears to be the 2sgacc form ninya + the
3plnom yalu with the adjacent /ya/ syllables simplified, rather than the predicted
ninyjalu or even ninyanyjalu.³³ Similarly, ninga seems to combine the 2sg root ni-
with the reduced 1sg pronoun nga. In both cases, the second syllable of the accu-
sative pronoun /nya/ may have been deleted to prevent two homorganic syllables
across morpheme boundaries.ninya-bula                                     (2sgacc/3dunom)

Third person non-singular accusative forms combine with third person non-sin-
gular nominative forms for all possible combinations.bula-nya-n-bula                                (3duacc/3dunom)

            ‘They used to teach them that other ceremony.’ (28.8.03.1.ER)
33 The lack of the -n- element suggests that speakers do not treat the /nya/ element in 2sgACC
ninya as an accusative suffix.
98       Pronouns(5.57)    najba bulanjal=i                  wajarri-kurri
          see     3duacc/3plnom=past fish-ds
          ‘They saw those two fishing.’ (Belfrage 1991field notes)The restriction on human referents for compound pronouns is most clearly seen
in third person non-singular contexts. In (5.58), there is no accusative pronoun
at all despite the transitive frame (see §5.5 for more on the co-occurrence of pro-
nouns and nouns).(5.58)    dulalaba            yalu     nanda danyan
          uncover(redup) 3plnom that             clothes
          ‘They’re going to take them out, the clothes.’ (20.6.08.KS)These compound forms occur obligatorily whenever the relevant transitive frame
has pronominal subjects and objects that have possible compound forms. For
combinations that are not compounds, it is far more common for the subject
pronoun (nominative) to directly precede the object pronoun (accusative). This
is the opposite sequence to compound forms. Tense and aspect markers, when
they occur attached to pronouns, attach to the first pronoun in the sequence.
The differences in the ordering and the attachment of clitics to the first pronoun
demonstrate a clear distinction between compounded pronouns and sequences
of two pronouns.(5.59)    najba=yili ngayu        yalu-nya    nayi      badajba

                                                     Reflexive/reciprocal pronouns         99
An exception to this appears to be when speakers use the first person accusative
form. Here, they seem to prefer the accusative pronoun before the nominative
pronoun, which possibly indicates an overall priority for first person singular
pronouns to occur first. Example (5.63) illustrates the variation in the use of com-
pound pronouns compared with sequences of free pronouns. KS’s first assertion
uses a compound pronoun, but her second (repaired) assertion uses a sequence
of free pronouns.³⁴(5.63)      KS:     wandimba ninyalu             wayka              Borroloola

            teach=hab       1sgacc 2plnom olden.times
            ‘You mob used to teach me before.’ (Mushin 2003 field notes)5.5 Reflexive/reciprocal pronounsReflexive/reciprocal pronouns are formed by attaching the suffix -ngka to the
oblique pronominal stem.³⁵ The first person reflexive form is the suppletive
ngaka. The third person singular reflexive/reciprocal form is na-ngka rather than
the predicted *nanga-ngka. This reduction of the oblique stem from nanga- to na-
is most likely to avoid juxtaposing two syllables that start with /ng/. The resulting
meaning of reflexive/reciprocal forms is either ‘self’ or ‘each other’. The inter-34 Furby (1972: 4) lists 1sgACC/3plNOM as the possible compound nganyjalu, but no
examples are given in this paper or in other published (and unpublished) work. No form for
1sgACC/3duNOM is attested (such a form might be predicted to be nganbula). My own corpus
has numerous examples of clauses with this combination of a third person plural subject acting
on a first person singular object, but all are collocations of the two full and free pronouns.
35 See Laughren (2002a) for an analysis of the almost identical Waanyi reflexive/reciprocal
system.
100            Pronounspretation of the use of these forms as reciprocal or reflexive depends largely on
context and on the semantics of the verb, but plural forms are usually interpreted
as reciprocal rather than reflexive. The full set of forms in given in Table 13.","[112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118]"

This term appears to contain the root nominal mungana ‘night time’. It usually
refers to ‘tomorrow’ (i.e., the day after the time of speaking), although it can also
occur in past time contexts (e.g., in narratives) to mean the day after the described
day.(6.171)    munganawa jilajba=ja          nakarra-yudi

7 Verbs
Garrwa verbs constitute a single class on the basis of their syntactic behaviour:
they canonically occur in main clause initial position and take class-specific
morphology associated with dependent clause formation. Garrwa verbs are also
somewhat unusual in the Australian context because they lack much inflectional
morphology. Inflectional categories normally associated with verbs in Australian
languages, such as tense, aspect, and mood marking, as well as person/number
marking, are largely absent (see Chapter 8 for tense/aspect marking). Most of the
verbal morphology is associated with the formation of complex clauses (§7.4).
     Verbs minimally include a verb root. In most cases, in order to be used as a
word, verb roots must be augmented with stem-forming morphology. Some of this
is productive, but much of the stem-morphology is frozen and no longer produc-
tive.
     Garrwa verbs maximally consist of a root, a stem-forming affix, and a word-
forming affix. Simple verb stems do not require a stem-forming affix (i.e,. the root
and the stem are the same form), but complex verb stems require a stem-forming
affix. These vary from forms with no clear synchronic meaning (e.g., -j- and -n-) to
those that have clear meanings (e.g., -rri-j- ‘causative’). Verbs may consist of more
than one stem (e.g., /wijkunumba/ ‘bring back’ comprises wi-j+kunu-mba). Addi-
tional morphology associated with the formation of complex sentences attaches
to the stem. There are three conjugation classes, described below, which are clas-
sified on the basis of their distinctive patterns of stem formation.⁵¹
     There is some degree of productivity in verb formation with many verbs trans-
parently built from nominal, adverbial, and other verbal roots. Verb stem-forming
affixation enables the form to be used as a verb. Verbs that do not have transpar-
ent nominal or adverbial roots may have originated as coverbs, and I call these
true Garrwa verbs here.⁵² The patterns of stem-formation and the transparency
of the semantics of the verb stem differ depending on whether the verb root is a
basic verb (§7.1) or whether it is derived from another word class (§7.2).","[170, 171, 172, 173, 174]"
"28 The forms and allomorphy of the deceased suffix are the same as the Waanyi allative suffix,
and the allomorphy here follows Garrwa allomorphy for the allative suffix -yurri. As such, it
seems likely that these are etymologically related.

4.6.1 -Wuya ‘dual’In (4.150), both the kinship noun kangku ‘FF’ and the qualifying noun minkin
‘skillful (one)’ take dual marking.(4.153)   minkin-wuya     ngaki    kangku-wuya
          skillful-du     1sgdat FF-du
          ‘Two great dancers, my two grandfathers (were).’ (28.8.03.1.ER)The word for ‘child’ is bayayawa. In dual and plural forms, baya functions as
the root morpheme. It is not clear what -yawa means. It does not occur in other
words. Note that, in (4.154), dual marking occurs in the presence of the 3dunom
pronoun bula.(4.154)   baya-wuya nayi kingkarri karrinja bula,                 baya-wu

          ‘There are two children up here standing at the ghost gum.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)The dual marker appears to be optional in the presence of the numeral kujarra
‘two’. In (4.155), the big referents, which happen to be animals, are marked with
the dual suffix in the presence of the numeral kujarra ‘two’, but, in (4.156), -wuya
is missing despite the presence of the numeral.(4.155)   jikuwarra     ngay=i            najba kujarra walkurra-wuya

are marked with the plural morpheme; however, the plurality of badibadi ‘old
woman’ is signalled by partial reduplication. In (4.158), however, the plurality of
badibadi is signalled with -muku (here, there are no other coreferential nominals
80        Nounsin the noun group). In this example, madamada ‘possum hair skirt’ is not overtly
marked as plural even though the plurality of ‘old women’ implies the plurality
of possum hair skirts. This reinforces the analysis that -muku only marks human
nominals.(4.157)   minkin-muku nana-muku badidibadi
          skilful-pl       that-pl      old.women(redup)
          ‘Great dancers, those old women.’ (28.8.03.1.ER)(4.158)   jungku=yili    yalu      badibadi-muku      madamada-yudi

          ‘All the old women used to wear possum skirts.’ (16.5.00.1.KS)In (4.159), all human nominal references are marked with the plural morpheme.
Note the inclusion of the 3plnom pronoun yalu (cf. (4.154) above with the 3dunom
pronoun bula) in the following examples.(4.159)   baki kuyu        nurr=i             waw~,
          and     bring    1plExclnom=past

          ‘We also brought young boys from the south, child(ren), this big mob.’
          (21.3.00.1.DmcD)When -muku attaches to a possessive pronoun, the meaning is ‘X’s mob’ (i.e., all
the people associated/related to X). Again, this reinforces the analysis of -muku
as a marker of numbers of humans only. Note again that, in (4.161), julaki ‘bird’ is
not signalled as plural even though it is clear the referent is plural from context.(4.160)   ngaki-nmuku=yili     yalu,       jila      nayi,
          1sgdat-pl=hab        3plnom walk           this

          (28.3.00.3.TD)Example (4.162) illustrates the use of -muku with the root baya ‘child’ to mean
‘children’.(4.162)   kuyu     yalu-nya    langki    baya-muku waluwijba

          bayayawa’ and dual ‘bayawuya’) (3.9.03.3.KS)4.7 PossessionThis section summarizes the ways in which both alienable and inalienable pos-
session is marked in Garrwa.a) Possessors in alienable possessive constructions usually take dative case
marking. This is particularly the case when the possessed is a (more) permanent
fixture, such as one’s own stories, which (4.163) illustrates, or a house, which
(4.164) illustrates. As discussed in §4.2.3, kin relationships are also marked with
dative case.(4.163)   karu ja=ngayu              ngaki        nayi jangkurr
          tell       fut=1sgnom 1sgdat            this  story
          ‘I’ll tell you this my story.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)(4.164)   wadara-na    ngama-ngi-nyina
          humpy-loc 1plIncl-dat-loc
          ‘in our humpy’ (15.5.01.1.DG)(4.165)   baki mankumanku=kiyi nanda nganyi, wangarr
          and     think=imp            that      2sgdat ceremony
          ‘And think of that your ceremony.’ (28.8.03.1.TD)
82        Nouns(4.166)   langandaba ja=ngayu            ngaki     diraji

          ‘I’m going to hang up my dress.’ (Mushin 2003 field notes)b) A temporarily possessed item (e.g., money) is marked two ways: with the asso-
ciative -yudi ‘with’, or with the possessor taking locative rather than dative case.
When -yudi is used, the possessor is subject and the possessed is predicate, which
(4.167) and (4.168) illustrate. However, when the locative -na is used, the pos-
sessed is subject while the possessor is predicate, which (4.169) illustrates. It is
not clear what motivates the choice between these two constructions in discourse.(4.167)   makirra-yudi      nanda ngila
          paint-with        that      girl
          ‘That girl has paint.’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 5.1.7.16)(4.168)   nayi yalu         badajba=ya, nayi waliji-yudi
          this    3plnom come=pres         this    meat-with
          ‘Here they come – here with a kangaroo.’ (4.5.01.5.KS)(4.169)   kaja      ngaki-ndu dungala
          many 1sg-loc           money
          ‘I’ve got lots of money.’ (lit. ‘Much money is with me’) (Mushin 2000
          field notes)c) Inalienable possession is mostly restricted to body parts. The possessed body
part shares the same case marking as the possessor. In (4.170), the possessor is
a nominative pronoun (intransitive subject of the sentence); in (4.171), the pos-
sessor is marked as an ergative nominal as the transitive subject of the sentence.
Self-propelled movement of a body part requires a reflexive subject, which (4.172)
and (4.173) illustrate.(4.170)   balkijba ngay=a            yami
          be.bad      1sgnom=pres eye

5 Pronouns
Garrwa pronouns fall somewhere between the category of independent words
and bound clitics. There is one set of pronouns, represented in Table 9 below,
with reflexive and reciprocal pronouns derived from this set (§5.5). A subset of
pronouns are able to combine to form compound pronouns (§5.4). Pronouns
share many properties with nouns, which includes grammatical functions such
as core and oblique arguments, the capacity to refer, and anaphoric functions.
Like nouns, pronouns inflect for case to signal the role they play in clauses. Pro-
nouns, however, have distinct case allomorphs from nouns (§5.2) and distinctive
syntactic properties (§5.6 and §5.7).
     In isolation, these forms are phonological words and can occur indepen-
dently (e.g., as one-word answers to questions). However, they are more often
found cliticized to a preceding word (i.e., prosodically dependent). The host
of the pronominal clitic is almost always the initial constituent in the clause.
These restrictions on pronoun placement, together with their loose phonologi-
cal dependency, make Garrwa pronouns resemble both free pronouns and bound
pronouns. Pronoun placement is described in more detail in §5.7. Bound pro-
nouns, in contrast with free pronouns, lack a distinctive paradigm, which makes
Garrwa typologically unusual among Australian languages.","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102]"
"7.2.1.1 Class 1 verbs derived from descriptive nominals
Where the nominal denotes a quality X, the derived class 1 verb has the meaning
‘cause to be X’.(7.26)    bayakada ‘small’     bayakada-mba ‘make small’ (cause to be small)
          bujalbujal ‘soft’    bujal-mba ‘smash, squeeze’ (cause to be soft)

          mulan ‘wrapped’      mulamba ‘cause to be wrapped, wrap’In some cases, these meanings have become more specific or have undergone
some semantic change. For example, kajamba, derived from kaja ‘many’, more
specifically means to cut something, usually goanna, into quarters. The form
kunymamba, derived from the nominal kunyba ‘good’ with some phonologi-
cal changes, more specifically means to ‘do something well’ (rather than, for
example, ‘to make something good’).(7.27)    yiliburun=yili    yalu,     jidinja        baba, mulan

One class 1 verb is derived from the interrogative wanya ‘what/who’ with the
meaning ‘what do?’. This does not seem to have a causative meaning.(7.35)     wanya ‘what, who’          wanyi-mba ‘what do’It is often used as filler when the speaker is searching for a verb.(7.36)     winjawa yalu         wanyimba,      winjawa     jalamba=ya

           ‘What are we going to do?’ (4.5.01.1.TD)7.2.1.4 Class 1 verbs derived from substantive nouns
Verbs derived from nominals that denote physical or substantive objects have
less predictable meanings than those that denote qualities (§7.2.1.1). This may
because these verbs have been used in the language for a significant amount of
time, which has shifted them to have more specific meanings rather than a com-
positional ‘cause X’. Clearly, there are also class 1 verbs that have compositional
meanings of the kind ‘cause X to exist’, which the following examples illustrate.(7.39)     bijibiji ‘plaited hair’   bijibiji-mba ‘plait (hair, string, bark)’
           buwarraji ‘dreaming’      buwarraji-mba ‘dream’
           jalyu ‘bed’               jalyu-mba ‘make bed’
           kaburr ‘initiate’         kaburr-mba ‘initiate’Each verb in the next set has a less predictable meaning, although this meaning
clearly strongly associates with the meaning of the each verb’s nominal root.
                                    Verbs derived from other word-class roots   171
Their meaning seems more associated with what one habitually does with the
object denoted by the nominal, rather than with what causes this object to exist.(7.40)    danyal ‘charcoal’    danyala-mba ‘put coals to cook’ (not ‘make char-
                               coal’)
          kandi ‘friend’       kandi-mba ‘help’ (possibly from ‘befriend’)

          ‘They used to walk, they helped them, the prisoners.’ (3.9.03.3.KS)7.2.1.5 Class 1 verbs derived from kin terms
Some class 1 verbs are derived from kin terms. These verbs only attribute the rele-
vant reciprocal kin relationship denoted by the kin term to the nominative subject
(also discussed in §4.2.3). This function is also achieved by using the kin term
with dative-marked pronouns, the usual way of marking alienable possession. It
is unclear why the verb formation should result in a reciprocal relationship, but
this is clear in the following examples.(7.43)    kukudi/kukuli ‘MM’    kukuli-mba ‘DS/D (for W)’ (also kukuli-nya)
          ngawuji ‘FM’          ngawiji-mba ‘SS/D (for W)’ (also ngawuji-nya)

There are a few class 3 verbs that are able to form causatives with the addition
of the class 1 stem -mba. It is not clear how productive this process is, however.
It should be noted that dalbu is a verb that means ‘pile up’ in Western (Light)
Garrwa, but a nominal that means ‘hill’ in Heavy Garrwa.(7.49)    dalbu ‘pile up’                     dalbu-mba ‘cause to be piled up’
          kunyunyu ‘cooked, ripe’             kunyu-mba ‘be done properly’
          linju ‘be in pain’                  linju-mba ‘cause pain’While most of the forms in the corpus are transparently causative and relate
directly to the meaning of the root, there are some forms that appear to have
undergone semantic extensions. For example, kunyumba, from kunyunyu ‘be
cooked, ripe’, does not mean ‘cause to be cooked/ripe’, but instead means ‘to do
properly’. This extends what constitutes something proper in other domains to
include eating cooked or ripe food. The semantic extension suggests that at least
some of these verbs have been used for a long time – long enough to undergo
semantic change.","[186, 187, 188, 189, 190]"
"7.1.2.1 -Daba
Daba is an independent verb that means ‘hit/fight/kill’. It conjugates as a class
2B verb, which suggests an underlying thematic –j- in the root. There are only a
few verbs roots that seem to be a combination of the simple root + daba, and in
only one case is the meaning of the simple root transparent (see (7.15)). These
words appear to share a meaning that involves some kind of physical (and pos-
sible destructive) contact.(7.15)      ban-daba                                   ‘split (log)’

All roots in this class are vowel final and almost all are disyllabic (there are some
trisyllabic roots in this class as well). Some allomorphs of the inflections are also
particular to this class, with the initial -j of inflectional suffixes replaced by -k
(i.e., in purposive, sequential, and same-subject forms). Inflected forms also
require the stem-forming suffix -n between the root and the inflectional suffix.⁵⁵(7.16)      Root: kuluka                                   ‘sleep, lie down’

55 It is possible that this stem-forming -n affix is the same -n- augment found prior to stop-
initial affixes in nominals and demonstratives (§6.1).

harmony in the purposive, sequential, and same subject forms between the final
vowel of the root /a/ and the final vowel of the suffix, as well as vowel harmony
in the different subject form, which alternates with syllable deletion. Deletion
of a repeated syllable across morpheme boundaries is common in Garrwa, but it
seems from the evidence here that it only applies to verb roots of more than two
                                                               ‘Basic’ verbs      165
syllables. For example, the final /ku/ syllable in the disyllabic wilku is retained
for all inflections.
     Some class 3 verbs end with the syllable /rra/ (e.g., balbalarra ‘move with
force’ and jankarra ‘hiccough’), which makes these verbs look superficially like
Yanyuwa verbs because they regularly end in /rra/. However, none of these verbs
in the Garrwa list are cognate with Yanyuwa words. There are also a number of
verbs that end with the syllable /nja/ (e.g., karrinja ‘stand’ and jidinja ‘carry
on side (like a coolamon)’), and this is similarly widespread in the region. For
example, Nordlinger (1998) comments on the widespread use of karrinja for
‘stand’ in this area, although this is not the form used in Yanyuwa.
     Like the other two classes, class 3 verbs also have a wide range of mean-
ings and can vary in valency. There are a lot of basic or general verb meanings
in this class (e.g., stance verbs like karrinja ‘stand’, jungku ‘sit, and kuluka ‘lie,
sleep’), but this is not indicative of the class. For example, the most general and
frequently used motion verbs are not in class 3 (e.g., jilajba ‘walk’, balba ‘go’,
badajba ‘come’), although it does include several more specific motion verbs
(e.g., wilku ‘run’, baru ‘dive’, and lila ‘fly’).
     A large number of verbs with the core meaning ‘carry’ are also in class 3.(7.19)     dukakana         ‘carry on shoulders’
           jawayawa         ‘carry in mouth (e.g., cigarette or chewing tobacco)’

           notes)7.1.4 Origins and ongoing changes to the systemIt is likely that all class 3 verbs evolved from earlier coverb forms at a time when
there may have been a distinction between coverbs and inflecting verbs. As noted
above, many class 1 and 2 verbs also have what appear to be coverb forms as their
roots. The difference is that, for class 1 and 2 verbs, the form -ba is required for
the verb to correctly function in sentences. In class 1 verbs, -ba appears to have
merged with the stem-forming affix (resulting in -mba/-mbi stems), whereas, in
class 2 verbs, -ba is not part of the verb stem.
      While clearly there is a connection between the form of the stem affix (-m,
-j, or -n) and the resulting verb class, motivations for assigning coverbs to the
different conjugation classes is not clear. There does not seem to be any clear
semantic basis to the assignment because verbs of all semantic types occur across
the conjunction classes (e.g., verbs of communication: Class 1 – yanyba ‘talk’
and kamamba ‘promise’; Class 2 – birijba ‘sing’ and kawawaba ‘argue’; Class 3 –
ngajaka ‘ask’ and karu ‘tell’). But neither does there appear to be a clear phono-
logical basis for class assignment: it is possible for members of all classes to be
vowel final and to be at least disyllabic. Class 1 verbs clearly have the widest pos-
sibility of root forms, which allows consonant final roots with /n/, /ny/, /rr/, and
/l/. Class 2 verbs only allow /rr/ and /1/, and these are relatively rare in that class.
Class 3 roots must be vowel final. Only in class 1 and 2 verbs are monosyllabic root
forms permitted because the process of word formation in these classes results in
                                    Verbs derived from other word-class roots       167
at least disyllabic verbal words. This would not happen in class 3 verbs where the
root form is also the unmarked word form.
     Given the decline in the use of Garrwa as an everyday language, it is not
surprising that evidence suggests that this three-way distinction between verb
classes is being simplified. In particular, there is a tendency, at least with some
verbs, to reanalyse the -ba ending as part of the stem, as is the case for class
1 verbs. Example (7.25) illustrates several class 2 verbs (on the basis of their
unmarked form) inflecting like a class 1 verb.","[181, 182, 183, 184, 185]"
"6.2.1 Compass directionalsThe citation forms for compass directions are: langki ‘north’, kula ‘south’, bayungu
‘west’, and karri ‘east’. They can take a range of suffixes that further specifies the
type of directional relationship. These are summarized in Table 15.
      The citation form for all four compass directionals has an underlying allative
meaning (i.e., ‘move in an X direction’). Three of the four (langki ‘north’, bayungu
‘west’, and karri ‘east’) have alternative root forms for locative case (in the case of
langki, bayungu, and karri), and ablative case (in the case of langki). Two of these
locative root forms, langku and karru, may be used to describe location without
-rri. The fourth compass directional, kula ‘south’, does not have a variant root

form, but has different locative and ablative case allomorphs (-rra and -ni, respec-
tively, not -rri and -na).
     These four cardinal compass directions can be combined to point to direc-
tions in between the cardinal directions. The ordering of compass directions does
not seem to matter (c.f. equivalent English compounds where the north/south
axis is first in the compound). The first in the sequence take the -ya suffix: kula-ya
karri or karri-ya kula ‘southeast’, bayin-ya kula or kulaya bayungu ‘southwest’,
langkiya bayungu or bayin-ya langki ‘northwest’, and langkiya karri or karriya
langki ‘northeast’. The same directions can be expressed with burrandi ‘middle’
(e.g,. burrandi langki ‘middle north (northwest)’ and burrandi karri ‘middle east
(northeast)).
     There are three directional stem forms. The citation form is also used alla-
tively (i.e., motion towards that direction). There is also a locative stem formed
with the suffix -rri that is used to indicate a place located in a particular direction.
The ablative stem, formed with the suffix -na, is used to indicate motion away
from a direction.
     Examples (6.64) to (6.69) illustrate the different stem forms with bayungu
‘west’. The citation directional examples (6.64) and (6.65) illustrate the under-
lying allative meaning. Examples (6.66) and (6.67) illustrate the locative form,
which indicates a fixed location in that particular direction. Examples (6.68) and
(6.69) illustrate the ablative form, which indicates motion away from the nomi-
nated direction.

As is common in many Australian languages, absolute directionals are used not
only to locate referents across larger distances, but also to locate referents in a
small or narrow spatial environment (e.g., within a room or within close proxim-
ity to speakers). In the narrative example (6.71), directionals are used to indicate
the direction that the protagonists are moving between as they dodge an enemy
who is trying to spear them. Example (6.72) was said as the interlocutors were
watching two boys playing in the part of the schoolyard to their south.(6.71)    ngarrkadaba=yi       wuni-na,  bulbulngijba bula

          ‘South, they are playing in the south.’ (20.6.08.DG)For even smaller locational contexts, such as when an object or person is being
located next to another object or person, the suffix -ya ‘side1’ is used. It attaches
directly to the root.(6.73)    jal=ili     yalu       jungku kula-ya          ngadanganja

          ‘That dog is sleeping on the south side of me.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)The locative stem can take a suffix -nyi ‘turn’ to specify that the referent is
turning to face a direction as they are moving.

            ‘He walked turning west along the river.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)The locative stem can also occur with the suffix -bana ‘side2’. Since -bana begins
with a stop consonant, the stem augment -n- also occurs, which results in the form
-nbana. While both -ya and -nbana are glossed as ‘side’, they differ in whether the
side in question is on a human scale (i.e., in relation to people or objects around
people) or whether it is on a geographic scale. For relation on a human scale, -ya
is used, while -nbana is used for a geographic scale. Conventionally, -nbana is

used to describe the direction that wind is coming from. All of these examples
have the present tense clitic to indicate that wind is blowing at the time of utter-
ance. Example (6.84) illustrates that this verb form cannot be used with anything
other than wind. A motion verb plus the ablative directional must be used, which
(6.85) illustrates.(6.83)    a.      bayungu-na-mba=ka         yunkurr

to specify spatial relationships on the horizontal axis. The other two absolute
directional words, kingkarri ‘up’ and wayka ‘down’, specify relationships on the
vertical axis. Both kingkarri and wayka are used not only for true verticality (e.g.,
skywards and groundwards), but also for indicating direction towards and away
from lower land masses (e.g., wayka indicates ‘towards a riverbank’ and kingkarri
indicates ‘away from the river’ ). These forms are mostly used to express direction
with geographic terrain sloping up (e.g., away from watercourses and up hills) or
sloping down (towards or at a watercourse and down hills).(6.86)    daba bula-ngk=i          wayka nana-ba, badibadi,

Wayka can also be used in contexts where the referent is underground or under-
water. Note that wayka refers to the downward trajectory and not to the resulting
location, which is what kala ‘under’ refers to (see §6.2.3 below).(6.88)    makaba=yili yalu        wayka      marada-na

          ‘And she would dive under the water again, that old woman, throwing
          (them) up (onto the bank).’ (9.5.01.1.KS)Wayka and kingkarri can also be used for motion along a vertical axis, such as
climbing a tree.(6.90)    bawa-nganja nanga-ngi, kirrijba=yi           kingkarri nani

          this down (at the base of the tree). He looked up(wards).’ (8.5.01.1.KS)These forms can also be used to describe the direction a form is facing (upside-up
or upside-down)(6.91)    baki kulkul=yili     yalu        larrkimba,                kingkarri

          ngalurr
          chest
          ‘And they used to cook turtle bellyside (turned) up.’ (2.5.01.1.KS)There also seem to be conventional uses of wayka and kingkarri associated with
places. In (6.92), the speakers in Robinson River use wayka to refer to where Bor-
roloola is located. This appears similar to the ways English speakers use up and
down to refer to places (e.g., down to Melbourne, up to Darwin, etc). In English,
there is typically an association with compass direction (north places are up and
south places are down). However, this may not be the case in Garrwa. In (6.92), for
138         Demonstratives, directionals, and interrogativesexample, it is unclear why Borroloola should be down from where the speakers
are located (at Robinson River).(6.92)      wandimba ninyalu              wayka Borroloola
            want        2sgacc/3plnom down
            ‘They want you down at Borroloola.’ (20.6.08.KS)Like compass directionals, the base forms kingkarri and wayka are inherently
allative; they indicate either upwards or downwards motion. When this motion
includes a specific endpoint (i.e., to an up place / to a down place), these terms
may also take directional suffixes, such as the ablative -(li)nya (i.e., motion away
from a goal) and the allative -(li)ji⁴⁶ (i.e., motion towards a goal).(6.93)      balba nurr=ili         kingkarri-ji mundumunduka

            ‘The old women (put clothes) up (on the line and) took them down.’
            (8.9.10.1.TD)
46 The allomorphy might be related to the number of syllables in the host (e.g., the two-sylla-
ble wayka has the longer allomorph), but it is hard to generalize with so few examples of this
phenomenon.
                                                                Directionals      139

           (3.9.03.4.KS)This additional directional morphology is only used when the directional word
is the only such word in the utterance. In (6.98) and (6.99), direction is explicitly
signalled by the allative-marked nominals; kingkarri and wayka remain in their
root form.(6.98)     wijba    yal=i           kingkarri dat         school-yurri

           ‘He fell from up there and hit down on the ground.’ (7.8.03.1.TD)6.2.3 Location adverbialsIn addition to the absolute directionals described in the above two sections,
Garrwa also has a closed set of (mostly) uninflected adverbials that are used to
locate objects relative to each other along different axes: yundu ‘top’, kala ‘under’,
walu ‘in front’, banykani ‘behind’, and kalawunyi ‘inside’. I also include juju ‘a
long way away’ and bangani ‘close’ in this category because they share morpho-
140        Demonstratives, directionals, and interrogativessyntactic features with the other forms, although these refer to distance in rela-
tion to the deictic centre rather than the locational axis.
     Like other adjuncts, location adverbials tend to occur at the ends of utter-
ances. They may co-occur with other locational words and phrases as in (6.101),
where yundu co-occurs with a locative case-marked nominal to indicate the
precise spatial relationship between the subject and the locative nominal as ‘on
top (of the horse)’, and (6.102), where banykani co-occurs with a locative nominal
to indicate that the subject is ‘behind the anthill’). In (6.103), kala and yundu con-
ventionally refer to two east-going roads from Robinson River to the Queensland
border.(6.101)    kirrijba=yi    yarrama-na jungku=yi yundu

            (3.9.03.4.KS)The suffix -nbana ‘side2’ can occur with yundu ‘top’, which makes it the only
suffix that is found across both directional and locational words. It is used to
focus on the relative positioning of one object with respect to a landscape feature,
such as a hill or a river. For yundu ‘top’, an additional syllable -wi- is inserted
between the locational word and the suffix, possibly to avoid two nasal+stop
clusters in adjacent syllables across morpheme boundaries (i.e., yundu-wi-nbana
rather than *yundu-nbana).⁴⁷(6.114)     ngala      nyulu-ma      barri malba=yi

47 An alternative analysis suggests that the -wi- augment occurs because yundu is a disyllabic
root. Note that the trisyllabic kingkarri does not have an extra stem-forming augment with
-nbana.

attract second-position clitics, including pronouns. While they share functional
and syntactic properties, only wanya takes case marking, which is consistent
with its function as a marker of unknown nominals. The other two forms take no
extra morphology.","[148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161]"
"7.3 Augmented verb stemsThe verbs described so far have consisted of one root, one stem-forming affix, and
(possibly) the final -ba suffix. There are, however, a number of Garrwa verbs that
have augmented stems. These are formed with an additional morpheme between
the initial root or stem form, and the final stem forming morphology. This limited
number of complex stem-forming morphemes does not appear to be productive
in new verb formation and may reflect an earlier period when verbs were more
compositional. The meanings associated with these augmented stem forms are
fairly transparent – they are mostly causative and inchoative.
178        Verbs7.3.1 -Rri- ‘cause state’The suffix -rri may occur following a class 3 verb root (i.e., without the -n stem
affix) or a nominal root with a causative meaning. This is itself followed by a -j
stem, and inflected as a class 2A verb.(7.69)     jungku ‘sit’                 jungku-rri-j-ba ‘set down’
           karrinja ‘stand’             karrinja-rri-j-ba ‘stand something up’
           dukana ‘carry on shoulders’  dukana-rri-j-ba ‘cause X to be carried

           ngabangabala ‘carry on back’ ngabangabala-rri-j-ba ‘cause X to be
                                        carried on back’For nominal roots, the resulting meaning is to ‘make X (i.e., cause X to exist)’. All
examples in the corpus are of substantive nominal roots (cf. derived class 1 verbs
in §7.2.1 above).(7.70)     niji ‘name’           nija-rri-j-ba ‘to name (make a name?)’
           wadara ‘humpy’        wadara-rri-j-ba ‘make a humpy’
           jalyu ‘bed’           jalyu-rri-j-ba ‘to make a bed (e.g., for a baby)’(7.71)     Bardakan nanga-ngi niji

These are not interchangeable, however, because jalyurrijba more specifically
refers to preparing a bed for a baby.
    There are also numbers of verbs that end with –rri-j-ba and whose meaning is
clearly causative, but whose root has no clear meaning synchronically. These are
most likely coverbs that have otherwise been lost.(7.73)      dimu-rri-j-ba ‘put a fire out’ (dimu = ??)
            kula-rri-j-ba ‘fill up’ (kula = ??)

7.3.2 -Kunu- ‘cause motion’The addition of -kunu- to a j-stem verb form results in a ‘cause-motion’ meaning,
which is usually associated with the transfer of objects. The resulting verb con-
jugates as class 1 verb. Most of the initial verb stems in this construction are from
motion verbs (e.g., badajba ‘come’ and wijba ‘return’), but verbs that take -kunu-
are not exclusively motion verbs (e.g., kinijba ‘be many’ and jadijba ‘grow up’).(7.74)    bada-j-kunu-mba ‘bring and show’ (badajba ‘come’)

with the suffix –ngu, which is then inflected as a class 2A verb.

          (Mushin 2010 field notes)7.3.4 Reduplicated verb rootsReduplication of the second syllable of the verb root is used to indicate itera-
tivity, intensification, or multiple participants in the event/activity. This process
appears to be fully productive and potentially applicable to any verb. The result-
ing meaning of this type of productive reduplication is dependent on the seman-
tics of the verb in combination with the general meaning of reduplication as a
multiplier of activity.
     Partially reduplicated intransitive verbs are usually used in contexts where
there are plural subjects.

action rather than the number of participants. This may be a consequence of the
combination of the particular verb semantics with the more general semantics of
reduplication. For example, marrirrimba (from marrimba ‘grab’) is used to mean
‘hold continuously (i.e., for a long time)’ rather than ‘hold many things’. Jilala-
jba (from jilajba ‘walk’) is used to mean ‘walk around’ (i.e., walk in no particular
direction over a period of time) rather than ‘many people walk’ (cf. Badadajba,
which is from badajba ‘come’, and which means ‘many people come’).","[195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200]"
"4.4.1 Ergative -wanyiThe ergative morpheme is used to signal the A-argument of a transitive construc-
tion. This appears to be the only function of the ergative morpheme.²³ Pronouns
representing transitive subjects are not ergatively marked, but demonstratives
and third person nominals are. Ergative allomorphy is determined by nominal
type. Most common nouns are marked with the -wanyi allomorph.(4.44)      nana-ngini walkurra-nyi       nganinyi-wanyi ngarrkadaba=yi

evidence of the kinds of patterns of optional ergativity that is described for other Australian
languages (e.g., McGregor 2006; Gaby 2008). Where there is a nominal subject of a transitive
sentence, it is marked with the ergative morpheme.

Inanimate A-arguments may also be coded with ergative case. These are fre-
quently weather or climate related terms, which raises questions about the extent
to which such nouns are conceptualized as inanimate in such contexts. Examples
(4.50) to (4.52), in which the inanimate nouns are floodwater moving over other
objects and an airplane in motion (respectively), illustrate this.(4.50)    mali-wanyi        murrumba=yi      ngaki      muwada

-yurru ‘deceased’ all take the -nyi allomorph rather than -wanyi. Common nomi-
nals that end in /rrV/ also take the -nyi allomorph (hence walkurra-nyi ‘big-erg’,
not *walkurra-wanyi).

consistent in elicited examples, in texts, only the initial nominal occasionally bears the case

Case concordance is discussed further in §9.1.1.

position or as a right-dislocated element following an intonation break. Erga-
tively marked nominals can and do occur initially as well, however, when the
nominal is pragmatically marked. For example, in (4.63), the speaker is speaking
to someone who has just knocked a video camera, shifting it off target. Wanymarri
‘white woman’ is pragmatically marked because it is in implicit contrast with the
person who knocked the camera. That is, the speaker is suggesting or warning the
addressee not to touch the camera anymore as the white woman (whose camera it
is) will come and re-adjust it. In (4.64), which is part of a reported speech passage
in a narrative, yingka-wanyi malbu-wanyi ‘another old man’ is in overt contrast
with the addressee (in the narrative).

            (3.9.03.3.KS)4.4.2 Dative -nyiThe dative morpheme -nyi has the widest range of functions of any case. It is used
in a range of oblique functions: benefactive, possessive, and other kinds of alien-
able associations (see §4.7 for more on possession). It is typically translated using
English prepositions ‘for’ or ‘with’. There are a small number of verbs that take
a dative object. Allomorphy is determined by nominal type. Common nouns take
the -nyi allomorph; pronouns take the -ngi allomorph; and demonstratives, inter-
rogatives and dative-marked possessive pronouns take the -nkanyi allomorph.
The Furbys have the additional allomorph –ngka that attaches to derivational
morphemes. I have no examples of this in the corpus, but provide examples from
Furby and Furby (1977).(4.65)      wajba     ninyalu              ngujbul-anyi wada-nyi²⁵
            give      2sgacc/3plnom        rotten-dat   food-dat
            ‘They give you rotten food.’ (common nominals -nyi) (11.5.01.1.KS)(4.66)      baki      yanyba ngay=i                  nanga-ngi
            and       say         1sgnom=past        3sg-dat
            ‘And I said to him...’ (pronoun -ngi) (15.5.01.1.DG)
25 Note that the verb wajba ‘give’ marks the theme and not the recipient with dative case
marking. It is perhaps more akin in meaning to using furnish as a ditransitive verb (e.g., “I
furnished you with supplies”).

            ‘That man went with many dogs to search for goanna.’ (Furby and
            Furby 1977: 3.6.1)Dative case-marking occurs in a range of relational contexts. Most of these are
typically associated with oblique marking across languages. In Garrwa, dative
case is used in contexts where the nominal is the beneficiary of an event, activity,
or object.(4.71)      ngayu      yundijba mama, wanymarri-nyi,           badibadi-nyi
            1sgnom cook            bread   white.woman-dat old.woman-dat
            ‘I made bread for the white woman, for the old woman.’ (1.5.01.2.TD)(4.72)      wijkunumba=yili nurr=i                wawarra-nyi nurri-ngi²⁶

            ‘We’d bring them (mountain berries) back for our kids.’ (2.5.01.1.KS)
26 This appears to further exemplify the lack of case concordance in discourse. The first
person plural-exclusive pronoun nurru is dative because it is possessive, but it could have a
second dative suffix to mark the pronoun as a member of the beneficiary.

noun(s). In cases where a datively marked pronoun is further marked with dative
as part of a possessed nominal group (e.g., phrases like ‘my mother’s axe’ and ‘my
father’s country’), the pronominal allomorph is -(n)kanyi, as it is for demonstra-
tives and interrogatives. Dative pronouns that end in the suffix -ngi (the regular
pronoun form) are followed by -kanyi rather than –nkanyi. It is possible that this
allomorph is selected to avoid the doubling of nasal consonants (e.g., niya-ng-
kanyi ‘1duIncl-dat-dat’ in (4.77) compared with ngaki-nkanyi ‘1sgdat-dat’ in
(4.78)).(4.75)    waydbala-nyi      waliji

          ‘Where is Rory’s camp?’ (Furby and Furby 1977: 3.1.19)There are also contexts of association where dative is found. Because Garrwa has
the associative suffix -yudi (§4.5.1), it raises the question of where the semantic
boundaries lie. Note that locative case is used in some contexts of association,
too. Example (4.81) demonstrates the close relationship between dative case and
the associative suffix -yudi because the speaker uses both morphemes to indicate
that the two story characters returned with a sugarbag (in their possession).(4.81)    wajili-nyi,             wijba=yi         bula       wada,

          ground.sugarbag-with
          ‘They came back with sugarbag – full of sugarbag.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)Dative case is found following the particle jidi ‘mixed (with)’, which functions to
associate a nominal referent with a habitual possessor.(4.82)    nayinda nganinyi jilajba=ngka jidi              wuni-nyi

66       NounsHowever, most examples of jidi in the corpus are followed by nominative nomi-
nals, which (4.84) illustrates.(4.84)    wankijba       yal=ili         jidi      jibarri,     lukuluku

          ‘They (men) would dance with women – in a circle.’ (28.8.03.1.ER)Dative case marking is also used to mark an oblique argument. There are some
verbs that require dative objects: for example, kujba ‘hunt’, yadajba ‘wait’, and
wadamba ‘feed’, while others may take an oblique argument optionally.(4.85)    kujba=yili  nurru            wada-nyi

the recipient is marked with dative case.(4.88)    wajba     yalu-nya mukunyjana-nyi

always used to mark the addressee. The accusative case can also be used, however.
The following examples come from the same narrative text and refers to the same
reported speaker and addressee, but the addressee is marked with dative case in
(4.94) and accusative case in (4.95).(4.94)    yanyba=yi nurru-ngi           kangku

poral location, position, and alienable possession. Some types of instruments are
also marked with locative case. The form of this morpheme is -na that follows
vowel-final nominal roots, and -ina that follows consonant-final nominal roots.
The allomorph -nyina follows demonstratives (including possessive pronouns)
and borrowed words from English. The allomorph -ndu (variant -nbu) follows pro-
nouns. Examples (4.99) to (4.101) illustrate the use of these different allomorphs
(pronominal allomorphs are discussed further in §5.2).(4.99)    ngakuya diba      yal=ili         bindaba Lurrunda      wabuda-na

ogy with place names. Examples (4.107) and (4.108) illustrate the use of place
names in locative contexts with no locative marking, while examples (4.109) and

gies for marking instruments in Garrwa (see §4.5.1 for other strategies for marking
instruments).(4.114)   kudiya-wanyi    yalunjal=ili           rangimba, nanda

porary in nature, such as the possession of money.(4.119)     kaja       ngaki-ndu dungala

            notes)Locatives are also found in a range of metaphorical contexts where spatial rela-
tionships in real space are not being marked. These include temporal contexts
(which (4.122) illustrates), but also contexts where associations involve abstract
or non-visible entities (which (4.123) illustrates).(4.122)     daba nurr=i                   nyinbu       kamba-na

and -rri appear to be in free variation, although -yurri is more common. Pronouns
take the -rri allomorph following the locative stem (see §5.2). Demonstratives
(including possessive pronouns) take a –nkurri allomorph. Examples (4.125) and
(4.126) illustrate the variation between -yurri and -rri by the same speaker during
the same storytelling event.(4.125)   mada              wijkunumba=yili nurru          wuju,

-nanyi allomorph.(4.131)   wanya     nanda yaji          karru-rri    junu,         nuyiburri-nanyi

77 Some narrative functions of clause-combining particles are discussed in Mushin (2005b).
240        Clitics and particlesa) Non-clause coordination(8.159)   badibadi    baki malbu
          old.woman and       old.man
          ‘Old woman and old man.’ (13.10.03.1.ER)(8.160)   ngila      walkurra     baki juka walkurra
          girl       big          and      boy big

          this-loc    and       that-loc
          ‘Here and there.’ (3.9.03.3.KS)In (8.160), baki occurs after an intonation break, but clearly conjoins two nomi-
nals.(8.162)   malumba bul=ili                baja,    jibarri, baki nganinyi
          mix         3dunom=hab dance woman               and    man
          ‘Those two used to mix up (in the) dance – woman and man.’ (28.8.03.1.
          ER)b) Clausal coordination
Baki’s most frequest use is to conjoin full independent clauses that signal discreet
sequential events. These events can have the same or different subjects (cf. simul-
taneous events that do morphologically distinguish same and different subjects
(§9.6.1)).(8.163)   kuyu       ngay=i              baki ngaraba      ngay=i
          take       1sgnom=past         and      drink    1sgnom=past

          ‘I’m watching the place and that snake came out.’ (Mushin 2010 field
          notes)Note that, while baki occurs clause initially, it does not attract second-position
pronouns or modal clitics (like directive =kiyi, which (8.168) illustrates). These
remain following the verb or other initial elements.(8.166)   munyba-yi      wabuda-wanyi,     baki jungku=yi

          ‘The water flooded the road and we were all sitting down there.’

          wijba    nurr=ili             kiwirri

          ‘We’d go and get tobacco and come back east.’ (22.3.00.1.DMcD)(8.168)   waykalumba=kiyi       kingkarri-nya      baki yarrijba=kiyi

          down        ground-loc
          ‘Bring it back down and put it on the ground.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)The habitual clitic =yili can, however, attach directly to baki. In these contexts,
the pronoun directly follows =yili as if bak=ili represents the initial element in a
clausal core. Examples (8.169) to (8.171) illustrate this below. Note, however, that
=yili does not have to attach to baki. Example (8.167), in which =yili attaches to
the pronoun, illustrates this. It is still unclear why the habitual clitic of all TA
clitics are able to attach directly to baki, why this appears to change the syntactic
status of baki when it does occur, and in what discourse contexts speakers prefer
the construction bak=ili .

TA marking. It is included here as a clause-combining particle because it con-
nects two clauses by signalling that the second clause in the combination occurs
‘in addition to’ or ‘as well as’ the first clause, which (8.172) and (8.173) illustrate.
In these cases, both conjoined clauses take TA marking to indicate that both are
independent clauses.

          ‘We would walk a long way, long way. Also we’d bring back watermel-
          ons.’ (1.5.01.2.TD)(8.173)   M.      kawa    wajba     nganinji            mada       birrkalijba

          ngayu
          1sgnom
          ‘M, come here (and) give me some too, I’m hungry.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)Like baki, mada need not conjoin two clauses. In (8.174), mada precedes the
nominal nganyaku ‘wild potato’ to indicate that the participants will not only dig
up kabala ‘yam’, but also nganyaku.(8.174)   nayi       kabala ngamba,        kurrijba ja=ngamba
          this       yam     1plInclnom dig          fut=1plInclnom

          ‘We(’ll) dig up these yams. We’re gonna eat them – also wild potato.’
          (2.5.01.1.KS)Unlike baki, however, mada may also occur utterance medially or finally, which
(8.175) to (8.177) illustrate. When mada occurs finally, it retains its function of
associating information as additional to what has been mentioned previously,
but has scope over the linguistic elements immediately prior to the end of the
clause.(8.175)   burradaba      nurr=ili             wakadawakada balalanyi

           ‘We used to grab (them) and playfully knock (them) over also.’
           (28.8.03.1.ER)When mada has scope over a pronoun, which (8.178) and (8.179) illustrate, it has
the sense of ‘together’. In these examples, mada does not seem to function as a
clause-combining particle, but rather as an adverbial-type particle of the kinds
described in §8.2 above.(8.178)    wudumba=kiyi nganyi, kandi, ja=nimbala              jilajba mada

tion, or relating events relative to each other in time. It is usually translated
as ‘but’ or ‘while’. Ngala is only used to combine clauses that occur utterance
initially, and is frequently separated from the previous clause by an intonation
break. Ngala can also occur turn initially to link a conversational turn with a pre-
vious turn. Clauses that start with ngala usually do not have TA marking and take
their overall temporal association from the first clause. This makes ngala-marked
clauses appear more like subordinate clauses, which also lack independent TA
marking. Unlike subordinate clauses, however, verbs in ngala-marked clauses are
in their unmarked form. Ngala is almost always directly followed by a pronoun
and/or modal clitics, which mark it as an initial constituent of the clausal core
(i.e., a word which attracts second-position phenomena), which (8.180) illus-
trates.","[257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262]"

dative, locative, allative, ablative, and translocative case suffixes to indicate the
role that they play in a sentence. The comitative suffix -yudi ‘with’ can be used
with all nominals to indicate temporary possession and instrumental roles. Case
allomorphy and range of meanings are described in §4.4. Unlike many languages
of the region, Garrwa does not have morphologically distinguishable noun
classes. There are a range of non-inflectional suffix morphemes that only apply
to human nouns, including markers for deceased persons, and dual and plural
morphemes. Kin terms also have a range of morphological properties that distin-
guish them from other kinds of nominals. These are described in §4.2.
    Garrwa does not seem to have any processes that derive nominals from other
word classes except nouns can form the roots of derived verbs (§7.2). Most other
non-inflectional morphology associated with nominals only applies to human
(or higher animate) referents. These morphological categories include number
marking (§4.6) and a marker for deceased persons, -yurru (§4.5.3).","[55, 56]"

matical functions in the clause (A, S, or O), b) signalling oblique grammatical
functions, and c) signalling a nominal’s spatial relationship with respect to the
state of affairs described in the clause. The morphemes described above as case
suffixes share the paradigmatic property of being the final morpheme in an
inflected word, should a word consist of a root and more than one morpheme.
There are also a small number of morphemes that attach exclusively to nominal
forms, but which are not part of the case paradigm.

4.5.1 Yudi ‘with’This morpheme is used in most cases of alienable possession (which is some-
times called associative case). It only occurs with non-human common nouns –
pronominals and human nominals use locative or dative case to signal an asso-
ciative/alienable possession relationship (see §4.7 for more on possession). While
-yudi shares properties with case markers as a marker of the role the nominal
plays in the clause, its restriction to non-human common nouns only and its
capacity to be followed by another case marker suggests that it is a different type
of morpheme from those described in §4.4.(4.137)   makirra-yudi      nanda ngila

          hair skirt.’ (16.5.00.1.KS)In the following example, the -yudi-marked nominal groups seems to function
more like instruments than simple alienable possessives.(4.141)   wajarrijba nurr=i                   wanka-yudi kaku-yudi

76        NounsIn most instances, instruments are marked with a locative case marker (§4.4.3),
although there are some examples (as above) where -yudi marks a nominal that
can be construed as an instrument. These tend to occur in transitive contexts
where the subject has ergative marking (unless it is a pronoun); when functioning
as an instrument, the -yudi marked nominals also take ergative marking. There
are no cases where ergatively marked nominals function as instruments without
-yudi. Note that, while the first two examples have body parts as instruments, the
second two examples do not. This suggests that alienability is not a factor in this
construction.(4.143)    daba ngayu          mani-yudi-nyi     jamba

           (3.9.03.4.KS)In comparative contexts, -mirra is used to indicate the superlative member of a
set.(4.147)    nayinda walkurra-mirra
           this        big-intens
           ‘This one is the biggest (of three jars).’ (Mushin 2011 field notes)There is no equivalent comparative morpheme, nor is there a comparative con-
struction that explicitly compares two items in the same grammatical unit. When
speakers need to make comparisons or identify something as having the most
of a quality, they do so with intensifiers and juxtaposed utterances. The particle
bijal ‘partly, a little bit’ may be used to indicate that one member of a set of two is
greater on some scale than the other member.(4.148)    nayinda      bijal     walkurra
           this         part      big

           ‘This one is smaller (of two jars) / this is a smaller one.’ (Mushin 2011
           field notes)4.5.3 -Yurru ‘deceased’This morpheme occurs attached to human nominals and kin terms to indicate
that the person in question is deceased. It does not occur with proper names.
The euphemistic term mudinyi is used in place of the proper name of a recently
deceased person.
78         NounsThere are a number allomorphs of -yurru. Determiners (including possessive pro-
nouns) take the form -nkurru.²⁸ The first syllable /yu/ is omitted when the nominal
root has a final syllable with a palatal onset (same morphophonemic principle as
applies to the allative suffix -yurri). The following example illustrates all of the
allomorphs.(4.150)     nayi Wakudi nayi kabuji           nayi, yurru-yurru,
            this name          this blind.one this old.woman-dec

            ‘This Wakudi, this blind one (nickname), this old woman my mother
            (deceased).’ (3.9.03.4.KS)(4.151)     ngaki-nmuku=yili yalu,         jila     nayi, kawuja-rru Nyanja

            ‘All this mob used to come here, my deceased aunt Nyanja.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)The next example shows that -yurru is optional with the possessive pronoun.
Note, however, that in this example (cf. (5.150) above), the pronoun occurs after
an intonation break, and may therefore be considered an increment (i.e., clarify-
ing whose grandfather).(4.152)     balba nurr=i                  kangku-yurru, ngaki

            ‘We went, (with) father’s father, my one.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)4.6 Number marking for human referentsGarrwa has dual (-wuya) and plural (-muku) suffixes that obligatorily attach to
nominals with human referents, which includes kin terms and demonstratives
referring to humans. Nominals that denote attributes of humans may also take
number marking. Animal references can also take number marking, although
this does not appear to be obligatory (see examples below). Inanimates never
take these number markers.","[91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96]"
"9.6.1 Dependent (participial) clausesBy definition, dependent clauses in Garrwa are clauses that only occur as part of a
larger clausal unit. In most cases, the verb of a dependent clause takes one of the
five suffixes described in §7.5 (purposive, subsequential, same-subject simulta-
neous, different-subject simultaneous, and irrealis). These suffixes indicate the
semantic relationship between the propositions of the dependent clause and the
main clause, typically in terms of temporal and causal relationships. As noted in
§7.5, the irrealis morpheme -kanyi is historically related to the dative case marker
-(ka)nyi, the same-subject morpheme -jina is related to the locative case marker
-(i)na, and the different-subject morpheme -kurri is related to the allative case
marker -rri. The purposive (-ji), subsequential (-jiwa), and same-subject (-jina) are
all formed around the suffix -ji, the origin of which is unclear. The clear rela-
tionships between dependent clause morphemes and case markers suggests that
verbs in dependent clauses should be treated as participial – more noun-like and
less verb-like – complements of main clauses.⁹⁷
     As complements of main clauses, the type of participial clause is shaped
by the type of the main clause: irrealis clauses are the complements of clauses
expressing speech and cognition, and are complements in negation; different-
subject simultaneous clauses are typically complements of verbs of perception;
same-subject simultaneous clauses typically occur with stance and motion verbs;
purposive clauses are typically complements of motion verbs; while subsequen-97 Furby and Furby (1977) call these “participial clauses”. See Austin (1981) for an earlier
description of similar clause types in a range of Australian languages, which includes Garrwa.
                                                                 Complex sentences           289
tial clauses appear less restricted in the relationship between other main and
dependent clauses.⁹⁸ Table 24 summarizes these relationships.","[306, 307]"
"
51 This is a radical departure from Belfrage’s (1992) and Breen’s (2003) analysis of Garrwa
conjugation classes. Their analysis did not allow for a distinction between roots and stems, and
was based on a smaller corpus of verbs than has been used for this study.
52 This hypothesis assumes an earlier period in the language when verbs comprised a closed
class of inflecting verbs and an open class of coverbs, similar to many other languages of the
region (especially Mirndi languages; for example, Schultze-Berndt 2000; Pensalfini 2003). This
analysis also explains the lack of tense, aspect, and mood inflection on Garrwa verbs. There is
no evidence of inflecting verbs in the contemporary languages.

7.1 ‘Basic’ verbsThis section describes verbs that are derived from roots for which there are no
attested nominal or adverbial forms. Verbs of this kind constitute the vast majority
of frequently used Garrwa verbs and occur across the three conjugation classes.
As noted above, verb roots rarely occur as full words. Most verbal words are com-
prised of a root, a stem-forming affix, and, depending on conjugation class, a
word-forming -ba suffix. The citation form of verbs, which is also the form used
in simple sentences, is called the unmarked form. Other forms used in complex
sentences are called inflected forms.
     There are three classes of verbs according to patterns of stem formation:
Class 1 (m-class), class 2 (j-class) and class 3 (n-class). Class 2 may be further sub-
divided into three subclasses (§7.1.2).","[174, 175]"
"8.2.1 Ngawamba ‘only, just’This particle restricts what is under its scope to that and only that. Ngawamba
precedes that which it has scope over. It frequently occurs clause or utterance
initially where it may attract TA clitics (which (8.140) illustrates) and second-
position pronouns. It can have scope over a nominal (which (8.141) ilustrates) or
an entire clause (which (8.142) illustrates). It is not clear how such scope relations
are established formally. In (8.141), it is clear from the contexts that the scope of
ngawamba is over the nominal (i.e., only the auntie was taken, not other people)
and not over the whole clause (i.e., *only took the auntie, not did other things),

position pronouns. It has scope over whole events, and indicates that the event

event (and its consequences) should not be taken too seriously. Speakers often
translate it as ‘anyway’.(8.143)   muningka       ngay=a             nyindu

but before a verb. In these cases, jabarri can be analysed as occurring immedi-
ately after second position. There does not seem to be a clear semantic difference
between initial jabarri and when it is found elsewhere.

238        Clitics and particles8.2.5 Junu ‘perhaps’This particle has an epistemic modal meaning conveying a lack of certainty and
is, therefore, glossed with ‘perhaps’. Speakers frequently translate this as ‘don’t
know’,‘perhaps’, or ‘I think’. Unlike most other particles, junu is found at the end
of utterances or at least at the end of an intonation unit. Adjunct-like or nominal
constituents may follow junu if there is an intonation break.(8.153)   jarrba     yal=i          waliji     junu        nyambal-yudi-nyi
          eat        3plnom=past kangaroo perhaps feather-with-erg
          ‘Perhaps they (those men) with feathers (on) ate kangaroo.’ (Furby and
          Furby 1977: 3.4.9)(8.154)   wanya      nanda yaji        karru-rri     junu,      nuyiburri-nanyi
          what       that      place east-loc        perhaps valley-abl
          ‘What’s that place in the east I think, from the valley?’ (3.9.03.4.HG)(8.155)   julaki     nayi    karri junu
          bird       this    east    perhaps
          ‘I think there are birds here eastwards.’ (3.9.03.4.DG)(8.156)   ngawamba ngay=i                  drawimba=yi        naniku
          only           1sgnom=past       draw=past          goat
          junu         nana-nkurri-wa
          perhaps      that-all-dir
          ‘I can only draw goats, I think, all the way to there.’ (13.10.03.1.TD)However, junu can be used in contexts where the speaker clearly knows the infor-
mation with some certainty. In such cases, junu conveys a sense that the factual-
ity of the information should be treated loosely and may involve more detail than
is being said explicitly. For example, in (8.157) below, the speaker recounts the
things she used to do when she was young and living around the Barkly Table-
lands. Here, the use of junu does not mean that she is not certain that they used to
muster cattle, but rather that mustering cattle was one among a number of things
they used to do.(8.157)   majirrimba    nurr=ili             buluki junu
          muster        1plExclnom=hab cattle          perhaps
          ‘We used to muster cattle (among other stuff).’ (25.8.03.1.ER)

Similarly, in (8.158) below, the speaker is recounting a trip to a woman’s dance
ceremony near Alice Springs. She talks about seeing the campfires of all the
women’s groups who have already arrived, something she had directly experi-
enced. The use of junu is not, then, about lack of certainty in this instance, but
rather about suggesting that there were lots of fires distributed around (and more
information besides).(8.158)    jilajba     nurr=i            baki najba nurr=i
           walk        1plExclnom=past   and    see  1plExclnom=past

           ‘We went and we saw these fires (among other things), for them.’
           (21.8.03.3.TD)8.3 Particles for clause combiningVarious particles have a more specialized function that concerns the combining
of clauses.⁷⁷ The syntactic properties of co-ordination and related types of clause
combining in Garrwa are described in §9.3.2. In §8.3.1 to §8.3.5, I describe the mor-
phological and semantic properties of each particle. Most clause-combining par-
ticles occur clause initially, except minji ‘conditional’, which occurs in second
position. They vary in the extent to which they attract TA clitics and second-posi-
tion pronouns.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"

                             east.’ (28.8.03.1)In (10.5), TD has begun telling ER stories from her early childhood. In (10.5a),
she names two older women and the subsequent talk is about establishing that107 Bradley (1992) lists Yanyuwa barra as an “emphasis” marker and a conjunction in the
dictionary. Yanyuwa and Garrwa have significantly different grammatical structures and so it is
unclear to what extent barra and barri share syntactic and pragmatic properties in the contem-
porary languages.
                            Information packaging and the marking of prominence             305
ER is able to identify who these women are. ER confirms identification in (10.5d)
and TD acknowledges this in (10.5e). TD then resumes telling her childhood story.
Barri occurs directly after the locative marked pronoun bulandu ‘with those two’.
The use of barri reinforces the link between the referent of the pronoun and the
women who have just been mentioned. More examples of barri in discourse are
in (10.6) to (10.8) below.
     In terms of its distribution, barri may occur anywhere in an utterance, but
it rarely occurs turn-initially or at the beginnings of intonation units. It is often
followed by an intonation break (but not always a pause), but rarely occurs turn-
finally. It never receives primary stress in utterances it occurs in, and is frequently
cliticized to the preceding word. Barri is not analysed as a clitic, however, as it can
also occur utterance initially, albeit rarely. It never occurs as the only word in an
utterance and so it is not an interjection in Evans’ (1992) sense.
     Garrwa speakers readily recognize the presence of barri in utterances and
will repeat them when listening back to recordings. They do not, however, tend
to translate barri when working on English translations of texts. When pressed,
speakers translate barri as ‘now’, although, as outlined below, the contexts in
which it is used are not all compatible with a temporal ‘now’ meaning.¹⁰⁸ Kirton
and Charlie (1996) note that ‘now’ is also given as the translation for the Yanyuwa
particle barra, but “It means ‘now’ in a specialized sense: to bring dramatic
immediacy to the topic or event that it marks” (184-185). It may be that barri/
barra began as a temporal deictic marker and has shifted to mark some kind of
immediacy in terms of information status.¹⁰⁹
     Since the meaning of barri does not emerge except in actual discourse con-
texts, for the rest of this section, I provide some extracts from conversation and
narrative discourse and account for the use of barri in each of the extracts. The
numbers in parentheses indicate the length of silence (a pause or gap between
turns) in seconds. The extract in (10.6) is from a conversation, while (10.7) and
(10.8) come from elicited narrative texts. A detailed explanation follows each
example.
     For conversational extracts, I keep the standard Conversation Analysis con-
ventions for transcribing talk. Silences between turns is indicated by a filled
108 While it is not uncommon for temporal words such as “now” to grammaticalize into dis-
course particles (e.g., Aijmer 2002), more analysis is required to determine if and how such a
change may have taken place in Garrwa.
109 The temporal adverbial barrin ‘earlier today/this morning’, which has a long /a/ vowel
and a clear final nasal, may be related to barri, although speakers now do not make an explicit
connection between the two.
306       Discourse phenomenabracket, and overlapping talk is signalled by square brackets (i.e., “[ ]”). These
are standard conventions for transcribing talk using principles of Conversation
Analysis. More information is given in Appendix A.","[322, 323, 324]"

79 Furby and Furby (1977) usually translate jala as ‘then’, although there is no evidence in the
corpus that jala is ever used to signal temporal progression.

          KS)In (8.201), which is from a personal narrative, it is not clear whether the jala-
marked clause is modifying Wollogorang (i.e., as a place where the speaker’s
mother had her children), or whether it is modifying the time when her mother
remained at Wollogorang (i.e., a time when she had her children). It is likely that
jala does not specify a temporal or spatial meaning because the two concepts are
connected in these examples.(8.201)   ngadanganja           ngaki,   jibiya Wollogorang,
          mother-anaph          1sgdat   remain Wollogorang

below, the common nominal yawulyu (a type of woman’s song) is modified by the
jala-marked clause.

both initial position and immediately following initial position. It always directly
precedes a pronoun if pronouns are present in the clause. When it occurs in
second position, it looks like a modal particle; however, its meaning and occur-
rence in initial position suggest it should be considered a clause-combining par-
ticle like ngala and baki. Clauses beginning with minji usually have their own TA
marking.
     Minji is described here as ‘conditional’ in the sense that a clause marked with
minji signals condition(s) under which some situation denoted in the following
clause obtains – a realis conditional. It can be used in both past and future con-
texts and can usually be translated as something like: ‘When X is the case, Y is
(or will be) the case’. Like baki and jala, the TA marker =yili can attach directly to
minji (resulting in the form minjili). Minji is distinguished from the other clause
combining particles in that it has scope over the first clause in the two-clause
sequence, whereas the other particles connect the second clause with a preced-
ing clause. This difference in scope may account for the different positional prop-
erties of minji compared with the other particles described in this section.
     Only one speaker (KS) used minji with any frequency in her discourse. Other
speakers clearly recognize and accept the form as Garrwa, but do not use it much.(8.204)    wabula          minji     ngayu   jungku,    Winmirri-na,

similar to the other clause-combining particles. In these contexts, it seems that
minji has a more temporal meaning (i.e., ‘when X happens, Y will happen’), but
this requires further investigation.(8.208)     minji       ninji     badajba Jinkula-na,      juka-wuya

9 Syntax
This chapter is mostly concerned with the linear ordering of elements in Garrwa
utterances, with some discussion of the basis on which larger constituents may
be defined.⁸¹9.1 Nominal groupsThe term group indicates a set of nominal forms that refer to the same referent
and that share the same grammatical and semantic role. I use the term nominal
groups rather than noun phrases, although the groups in question do exhibit
some phrase-like behaviour. Members of a nominal group may occur in a pro-
sodic unit, but they may also occur across intonation boundaries. While members
of a nominal group frequently occur contiguously (as one might expect of noun
phrases), they may also be discontinuous. The main discourse function of
nominal groups is to identify referents.","[268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273]"
"1.5 Previous linguistic work on GarrwaAlthough Garrwa (also spelled Garawa, Karrwa, Karawa) people have been in
contact with Europeans since the late 19th century, there appears to have been
little linguistic interest in the Garrwa language until the mid 20th century.
Garrwa people worked in and around the developing pastoral industry, but there
appears to have been little interest in documenting the language until the 1960s.
A linguistically distinct Garrwa people were identified by the beginning of the
20th century as part of anthropological surveys of the area (e.g., Basedow 1907;
Mathews 1899; Tindale 1940).
      The first substantial elicitation of Garrwa language comes from Ken Hale’s
survey in 1960–1961. Hale’s data, recorded during the Brunette Downs races,
largely consists of words and simple sentences designed to produce grammati-
cal paradigms such as pronouns and case markers. Elicitations and transcrip-
tions of Garrwa language were also made by Velma Leeding in Borroloola and
Darwin in 1964, Charles Osborne in Doomadgee in 1966, Elywn Flint in 1968 in
Doomadgee as part of the Queensland Speech Survey, and Nils Holmer in West-
moreland (QLD) in 1979. Most of these involved elicitation of words, pronoun
paradigms, and simple sentence types. In many cases, it is unclear whether the
Garrwa people consulted were speakers of Western or Eastern Garrwa. Data col-
lected in Doomadgee is more likely to be Eastern Garrwa than data collected in
and around Borroloola, but Osborne’s informant was born in Robinson River and
was clearly a Western Garrwa speaker.
      The most substantial descriptive work on Western Garrwa in the 1960s was
carried out by Edward and Christine Furby, both Summer Institute of Linguistics
(SIL) linguists, during the period 1968–1970 in Borroloola. The Furbys compiled
an extensive corpus, including a 3000+ wordlist, texts, and a series of publica-
tions on aspects of Garrwa grammar (including Furby 1972; Furby 1976; Furby and
Furby 1977). Following the Furbys’ work, a number of SIL texts were produced
in Garrwa including children’s readers and a translation of parts of the the New
Testament. Further translation of Christian texts and songs into Garrwa is being
continued by Alan and Lucy Rogers who resided in Robinson River in the late
1980s, and who are now based in Darwin. Gavin Breen conducted fieldwork in
Doomadgee in the late 1980s and his comparative work on Garrwa and Waanyi

(originally produced in manuscript form in 1989) was published in 2003 in Evans’
collection of Non-Pama-Nyungan languages (a continuing reminder of the con-
tended status of Garrwan languages). Breen’s work is the only published work
that focuses on the Eastern Garrwa variety.
     In 1992, Hugh Belfrage produced an honours thesis on aspects of Garrwa pro-
nominal and verbal morphology, and a revision of his analysis of verb morphol-
ogy was also published in 2003 in Evans’ volume. While working for the Northern
Territory Department of Education, Belfrage also compiled a draft dictionary in
1997 using the Furbys’ corpus.⁵

6.1.1 AbsolutiveAn absolutive form, used in citation and in S and O grammatical roles, usually
comprises the demonstrative augmented stem form nayi-n- /na-n- combined
with the suffix -da.⁴² The resulting forms are nayinda and nanda (*nananda). It
is unclear why the root of the distal demonstrative is reduced to na- in the abso-
lutive form. Speakers also sometimes use the bare stem forms nayi and nana in
absolutive contexts.⁴³
     The absolutive form can function as the sole constituent of a noun group
with the meaning ‘this one’ or ‘that one’, or it can combine with other nominals
in a noun group (see §9.1 on nominal groups). It is typically the first word in a
nominal group and precedes co-referential common nouns. In these combina-
tions, the demonstrative appears like a determiner, and this is reflected in the
English translation.",[133]

70 KS alone of the speakers I record uses nurri as the form for first person plural exclusive.
71 Ganggaliida also has the present tense clitic =ngka (ti), which is only used when there is a
third person singular object (the allomorph =ti is used elsewhere) (Keen 1983: 322)
                                                                               Clitics        215
     The full form =ngka attaches to most verbs, with the allomorph =ka used
when the final syllable of the verb includes a nasal+stop combination (thus pre-
venting two nasal+stop clusters in succession). The allomorph =ya alternates
irregularly with both =ngka and =ka.⁷² Examples (8.36) to (8.40) illustrate the use
of the different allomorphs.(8.36)      wijba=ngka     bayungu-na

            ‘A baby is crying.’ (Mushin 2010 field notes)(8.40)      nyindu=ya nana-ma             badada
            cry=pres       that-ident baby
            ‘That baby is crying.’ (Belfrage 1991 field notes)In earlier work on Garrwa, the reduced =a form was described as attaching to first
person singular pronouns. The form is attested in Hale’s 1962 field notes and in
Furby (1972), but it is only found irregularly in my own data. Furby (1972) analyses
=a as a general pronominal form of =ngka and analagous to the =yi/=i alterna-
tion for past tense. However, it is clear from all examples that this form is only
72 Belfrage (1992) analyses =ya as a separate morpheme from =ngka, although he is unable
to provide a clear description of its meaning separate from meanings associated with =ngka.
While he claims it can be used in past contexts, all examples given are consistent with the use
of =ngka. It appears to be a lenited version of =ka that occurs with nasal+stop combinations. It
is unclear what motivates this allomorphy because it is irregular in the corpus. It may be follow-
ing a similar pattern to =kili/=yili alternation, described below.

pronouns, both the pronoun and the verb remain unmarked, and the present
time reference is interpreted from context. This is illustrated in an elicited series
from Hale’s 1962 field notes.(8.44)    a.       janyba=ka      dalu

Indeed, the reformulation in (8.48) (from kululuka=ngka ‘(they) are sleeping’
to kululuka yalu ‘they are sleeping’) is evidence that the present clitic is, under
normal circumstances, restricted to third person singular and first person singu-

phenomena, which (8.64) and (8.65) illustrate. Speakers also use =ngka when
describing cultural practices. Example (8.66), which is from a text describ-
ing preparations for a ceremony, illustrates this. The speaker is describing how
women make skirts in general, rather than describing an actual skirt being made
at the time of speaking.(8.64)    kabala walajba=ngka wuju wayka-linya           jamba-na

          3pl-dat
          ‘Well you can go down there to sing for them.’ (20.6.08.KS)Like the past tense =yi, the future clitic is found attached to either verbs or pro-
nouns. Unlike the other TA clitics, there is no change in form according to whether
the clitic attaches to a verb or to a pronoun. The main variation in the use of =ja=
is whether it encliticizes to a prior word as other TA clitics do, or whether it pre-
222          Clitics and particlescedes the word to which it is attached as a proclitic. =Ja= is always an enclitic
when it attaches to a verb, but it may be either an enclitic or a proclitic when
attached to a pronoun, which examples (8.78) to (8.80) illustrate.⁷³a) =Ja always occurs as an enclitic when it is attached to verbs with no pronoun
present.(8.78)      baku dukumba=ja ngadara-wanyi
            later dry=fut           sun-erg
            ‘The sun is going to dry (it) later.’ (Mushin 2003 field notes)(8.79)      langandaba=ja
            hang=fut
            ‘(He/She)’s going to hang (it) up.’ (Mushin 2003 field notes)(8.80)      yanyba=ja      winyurru       baku wujuju bayungu

            ‘(He’s) going to talk later to them all day, westwards.’ (3.9.03.4.KS)b) =Ja may encliticize, especially in elicitation contexts, but also in some texts, to
second-position pronouns. This seems to be the main placement for =ja in Hale’s
(1962) field notes, but is not the preferred placement in my own corpus.(8.81)      baku ngayu=ja            yadajba na-nyina
            later 1sgnom=fut wait                this-loc
            ‘I’m going to wait here for a long time.’ (29.11.06.1.DG)(8.82)      balanja ngayu=ja                    Garrwa,        nani
            try         1sgnom=fut              Garrwa         like.this

            ‘We’re all going to (go there) when they ride a horse.’ (speaker was
            asked about the upcoming rodeo) (8.8.03.2.TD)
73 It is still unclear what motivates the position of =ja= with respect to pronouns.
                                                                           Clitics          223

            ‘What are you two going to return for?’ (8.8.03.2.TD)c) Overall, in the vast majority of cases of both elicited materials and in texts,
=ja= occurs before a second-position pronoun, and, in the vast majority of these
cases, =ja= cliticizes to the pronoun as a proclitic, not to the prior word as an
enclitic. This is the case even when the prior word is a verb, which examples
(8.85) to (9.89) illustrate.(8.85)      ngaraba     ja=ninji,       kunyba       wabuda

            I’m (going) east soon. (3.9.03.4.KS)74 The ja= 1sgNOM pronoun combination is almost always involves reducing the pronoun
ngayu to nga. This is the only context where ngayu is systematically reduced in this way.
224        Clitics and particlesd) Unlike the other three TA clitics, =ja= can occur utterance initially, but it must
be attached to a pronoun in this position. These are cases where the pronoun
occurs initially because it is in a context of prominence. It appears that the future
marker may remain preceding the pronoun in these contexts, even though it
would be grammatical to position the clitic following the pronoun (which exam-
ples (8.81) to (8.84) illustrate). In (8.91), the future marker is the first element of
the speaker’s turn in a conversation. In (8.92) to (8.94), the future marker is the
first element of a new intonation unit.(8.91)     ja=ninyalu               manku video na

A common practice in discourse and especially in narration is to utter a length-
ened vowel (usually /e/) over a constant pitch to represent the passing of time.
This vowel may be held for seconds and this, together with the sustained pitch,
gives the word a singing-like quality. Furby and Furby (1977) analyse this practice,
which is widespread in Australian Aboriginal discourse, as a durative morpheme.
I retain the gloss ‘durative’ for this practice, although it is unclear whether it
should be analysed as a morpheme. At the least, it is a regular means for speakers
to express the passing of time in speech.
     I transcribe this practice as eee when it occurs utterance initially and as ==
(two equals signs) when it directly follows another word. Examples (8.97) and
(8.98) illustrate the use of this.(8.97)    eee,    yanyba=yi    nurru-ngi       kangku     “barriwa
          dur     say=past     1plExcl-dat     FF         finished

          sleep at Wulnguna tomorrow”.’ (15.5.01.1.DG)

            ‘I cooked food at the place. I cooked and cooked.’ (8.9.10.TD)8.1.2 Modal cliticsThe set of clitics classified here as modal express something about a speaker’s
evaluation of an utterance. Three of these have a deontic modal meaning associ-
ated with obligation and which are either addressee oriented, speaker oriented,
or group oriented: the directive clitic =kiyi (speaker evaluates utterance as some-
thing the addressee is obliged to do); the obligation clitic =kiya (speaker evalu-
ates utterance as something done or not done with approval or disapproval); and
the hortative clitic =nyi (speaker evaluates utterance as something a third party
should do). The fourth modal clitic =wali is epistemic, and the fifth clitic =kuna
frames an utterance as a polar question.
     Modal clitics attach directly to initial constituents regardless of word class.
If there is a second-position pronoun, the clitic attaches to the initial constituent
prior to the pronoun.","[232, 233, 234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244]"
