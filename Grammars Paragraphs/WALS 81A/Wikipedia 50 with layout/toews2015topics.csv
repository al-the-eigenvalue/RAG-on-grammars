"2.5.1.1 Kru Languages Are SVO and S Auxiliary OV
Kru languages have mixed word order properties. If there is no auxiliary, the word order is SVO
but in certain environments (such as negative clauses), the order may change to S Auxiliary OV.
The affirmative clause in (127a) has SVO order, but when the same clause is negated with an
auxiliary (127b), the order of the object and the verb is reversed, and the order is S Aux OV.127.    language: Dewoin (from Marchese 1986:168)        a.       ɔ                          pi       sayɛ̀.                     affirmative
                 he                         cook     meat
                 He cooked meat.        b.       ɔ      se            sayɛ̀          pi.                        negative (with AUX)
                 he     NEG.AUX       meat           cook
                 He didn't cook meat.",[111]
"       The difference between auxiliaries and particles is that auxiliaries always occur in clauses
where the basic word order is S(Aux)OV whereas particles occur in clauses where the basic
word order is S(Part)VO. Thus, negative auxiliaries induce a change in word order from SVO in
the affirmative (35a) to S(Aux)OV in the negative (76b). Negative particles do not have such an
effect (77b).
       Notice in (78) that the object kùà and the verb nu are reversed from one example to the
next: the negative perfective has OV word order while the negative imperfective has VO word
order. It also appears that the verbs are uninflected in this case, since the verb for the perfective
(78a) and imperfective utterances have the same form.",[178]
"
       A verb (V) and its object (O) are one kind of head-complement pair. In languages with
VO word order, such as English, the head (V) precedes its complement (O) in surface structure.
For example, in (19a), the verb eat precedes its object food. OV order is not possible (19b). The
verb-object pair in (19a) has the structure in (20). This conforms to the permitted structure from
(18a) because the head precedes the complement.
19.    a.      I eat food.            (SVO)
       b.      * I food eat.          (*SOV)20.",[143]
"       Languages with OV word order, such as Siamou, are not as simple. In Siamou sentences,
VO word order is not permitted (21ba). Instead, verbs follow their objects (21b), which is
complement-head ordering.21.    b.      *Ń   (ni)       dì             le.            (*SVO)

               1SG FIN         food           eat.PRFV
               I eat food.",[143]
"3.4.4.1 Perfective Uses Negative Auxiliary with OV Order
All perfectives in the Kru languages discussed by Marchese (1986) are negated by an auxiliary.
The auxiliary causes the word order to change from VO to OV. Example (76a) shows an
affirmative perfective. Notice that the verb (pi) precedes the object (sayɛ̀). Example (76b) is a
perfective negated by the auxiliary se. In this sentence, the object precedes the verb.",[177]
"        Koopman (1984) analyzes the OV/VO alternation of the kind shown in (127) as a verb-
second effect. The underlying position of the verb is in the VP following the object (OV). When
the higher INFL position is empty, the verb raises to fill it, resulting in an SVO order, as in
(127a). When there is an auxiliary, as in (127b), it fills INFL and the verb remains in situ,
resulting in an S Aux OV word order. Thus, S (Aux) OV would be the basic word order in Kru.
Marchese (1986) also argues that the surface SVO order has developed from a historic SOV
order (Marchese 1986:94). Kru has a number of OV properties that support this hypothesis. First
of all, Kru languages are predominantly suffixing. For example, in most Kru languages, the
plural is a suffix. The plural of pu ('gun') in Tepo is pui (129).129.    language: Tepo (from Marchese 1986:16)        a.      pu              b.      pu-i
                gun                     gun-PL
                gun                     gunsKru languages have postpositions, as opposed to prepositions (130).130.    language: Neyo (from Marchese (1986:18), originally from Thomann (1905))        nezo ko

        nā      ɓūtū
        my      houseCompounds have an OV word order (132).",[112]
"       Koopman (1984) argues that this alternation is a verb-second effect similar to what
occurs in many Germanic languages. In this analysis, the underlying word order in Kru is SOV.
If an auxiliary occurs in the inflectional phrase (INFL), that position is filled, and the word order
remains S (Aux) OV. If there is no auxiliary, the verb raises to INFL resulting in a derived SVO
word order.
       In many Kru languages there is a contrast between auxiliaries and particles (Marchese
1986). (See 3.4.4.) Auxiliaries, as stated above, occur in clauses with an OV word order while
particles occur in clauses with a VO word order. For example, the auxiliary se (NEG.AUX) in (35)
changes the word order from SVO in (35a) to S (Aux) OV in (35b).",[150]
"
3.4.4.2 Imperfective Uses Negative Particle with VO Order
Imperfectives are negated by a particle. The particle does not cause a change in word order. In
the affirmative sentence in (77a), the verb (na) precedes the object (tawa), the same as (76a). In
the negative sentence (77b), the verb still precedes the object.77.    language: Dewoin (from Marchese 1986:168)       a.       S                              V        O              affirmative

                He doesn't smoke.",[178]
"Based on the data in (24-25), the head-final order seems to be the most prevalent surface order in
Siamou.
        Cross-linguistically, there are certain properties that are more commonly associated with
SOV word order and other properties that are more commonly associated with SVO word order.
Siamou has mixed word order properties. For example, in Siamou enclitics and suffixes are
much more predominant than proclitics and prefixes. Enclitics are used to mark plurality (26a)
and definiteness (26b), and a suffix is used to mark aspect (26c). This is common for SOV
languages (Greenberg 1966, Marchese 1986, Comrie 1989, Croft 2003).26.     a.      lu=ì

2.3.1 Basic Word Order Is S (Particle) OV
The basic word order of Siamou clauses is S (Particle) O V (27).","[58, 59]"
"
Instead, Kayne (1994) argues that OV word order is derived from an underlying VO word order,
which means that (21a) has the structure shown in (23).94 The object (le) moves up from the VP
into a higher phrase (which I call XP for now). The original position of le is marked by a trace
(t). This is why Kayne's (1994) theory is called anti-symmetry: the OV structure in (23) is not
symmetrical with the VO structure in (20).",[144]

                        French: Il a mangé de la nourriture. (C)There are two main ways to derive this: for Kayne (1994), it must be the case that Siamou has an
underlying head-initial (VO) word order. In this case the aspect head precedes the verb phrase
(Asp VP) and the verb has to raise and adjoin to the aspect head in order to derive the surface
(VP Asp) order, as shown in (33a). The object must also raise to a higher position (called Spec
AgrOP) in order to derive the surface (OV Asp) ordering (see Pollock 1989 and Roberts 1997).
        The second possibility, which Kayne (1994) would reject, is that Siamou has an
underlying head-final (OV) word order. In this case, the aspect head follows the verb and can
attach to it via right-alignment (V Asp). This is shown in (33b).33.     a.                                                  b.",[149]
"Marchese (1986) argues that even though SVO is the predominant word order in Kru, there are
more SOV characteristics than SVO characteristics. She argues that this is the result of a proto
SOV word order, which reflects the fact that Kru is part of the Niger-Congo language family
(Marchese 1986:23). This is supported by Koopman's (1984) analysis of verb-raising as
described above.",[153]
"        Unlike auxiliaries, particles do not cause a change in word order. In (128), there is a
negative particle with a VO word order. This is the main way particles are distinguished from
auxiliaries in Kru languages: they do not cause a change in word order, while auxiliaries do
(Marchese 1986).",[111]
"3.2.1.3.1 Wh-movement in Siamou? No
In many languages, wh-words raise to a higher position, leaving behind a trace (28a). Siamou,
however, has wh-words in situ (28b). Raising is ungrammatical (28c). Instead, an utterance like
(28c), without the trace, has a different interpretation, since the subject and object have inverted.",[146]
"
66
   In Siamou I argue for an S Part OV word order. However, since Siamou does not contrast auxiliaries and particles
like other Kru languages, this is essentially the same thing as saying it has an S Aux OV word order.",[111]
"
3.2.1.2 Siamou Is Consistently Head-Final
In Siamou, sentences always have surface SOV word order, as shown in (21) above. In fact, all
lexical heads in Siamou follow their complements. This is true for verb phrases (24a), noun
phrases (24b) and postpositional phrases (24c).9524.      a.       DP       V         [le]    [dì]

   For simpilicity, the diagram in (23) leaves out the aspectual inflection of the verb dì and uses only the bare verb
form di. Later in 3.2.1.4 I show the structure of the aspect phrase as well.
95
   I do not have any data to show the order of adjective phrases. It may be that Siamou does not have transitive
adjectives.",[144]
"In Siamou, however, the passive is not morphologically marked in any way. Rather, if a
transitive verb has no object, it is interpreted as passive. An active Siamou sentence is given in
(31a) and its corresponding passive in (31b). The object le ('food') from (31a) is raised to subject
position in (31b).31.    a.      Active:          À       ri     le     dì-ɲɛ̀n.

3.2.1.4 The Structure of Aspect in Siamou Following Anti-Symmetry (Kayne 1994)
For Kayne (1994), anything that looks like SOV is really just SVO in disguise. Since Siamou has
many properties of SOV languages, including, of course, SOV word order, Kayne (1994)
predicts that these structures must all be derived by leftward movement (even though leftward
movement in Siamou is not very pervasive). If we adopt Kayne's (1994) analysis, this has
implications for the structure of the Siamou aspect phrase, as I explain below.
        In Siamou, aspect follows its VP complement as a verbal suffix (VP-Asp), as shown in
(32). The aspect head -ɲɛ̀n (STAT) is given in brackets, preceded by the verb phrase (le dì). The
rest of the clause that is not part of the aspect phrase is in parentheses.","[148, 149]"
"2.5.1. Characteristics of Kru Languages
Kru languages have an S Aux OV word order66, and sometimes an S (Part) VO word order
(2.5.1.1). They are also characterized by complex tone systems (2.5.1.2) and a basic aspectual
contrast of perfective and imperfective (2.5.1.3).",[111]
"Siamou differs from other Kru languages in that sentences with copulas do not have the order

"3.2.2.1 Kru Has Surface VO and OV Word Order

the word order is consistently SOV. However, most clauses have some kind of particle, often ri,
in second position. Perhaps further study will reveal that these particles are actually auxiliaries
similar to those in other Kru languages, and that they occur in all clauses, even though they may
not always be overt. This would mean that the INFL position is always filled and there is never
any cause for a change in word order because the verb never has to raise.
       Section 3.2.1.2 discussed some SOV and SVO characteristics of Siamou as it related to
anti-symmetry. Here I look at some of these characteristics again, making a direct comparison
with the examples for Kru in 3.2.2.1.
       First I look at SOV characteristics. In Siamou enclitics and suffixes are predominant:

2. Grammatical Sketch of Siamou
The goal of this chapter is to provide an overview of the Siamou language. I begin with the
phoneme inventory in 2.1. In 2.2, I introduce the tone inventory. Section 2.3 covers some
syntactic information, such as basic word order, and the structure of nominal and verbal
projections. Section 2.4 provides background information on Siamou, including demographic
and cultural information as well as a review of the literature on Siamou. Section 2.5 is about how
Siamou fits into the Kru language family, and section 2.6 concludes. Much of the information in
this chapter, except where otherwise specified, has not been presented before and is intended to
be a contribution to language documentation.","[38, 39]"
"3.2.1.3 Is There Evidence for Leftward Movement in Siamou?
This section explores three situations where movement commonly occurs cross-linguistically:
wh-questions, relative clauses and the formation of passives. (See Adger 2003.) Although this is
not the same type of movement as the verb-raising in anti-symmetry, we might expect that if a
language uses movement as a common strategy, it would be more likely to use movement to
derive its surface SOV word order. It turns out that Siamou does not use movement as a strategy
in wh-questions (3.2.1.3.1) or relative clauses (3.2.1.3.2), but it does in passives (3.2.1.3.3).",[146]
"                                                                                                       95
2.5.3 Siamou Is an Outlier Relative to Other Kru Languages
Of the 39 Kru languages, most fit into two branches: a western branch (23 languages) and an
eastern branch (11 languages). Of the remaining five languages, three belong to the Aiza group,
spoken in Ivory Coast. Two languages, Kuwaa and Siamou, do not belong to any subgroup
(Marchese 1983, Lewis et al. 2013).
       This means that we expect Siamou not to show stronger similarity to Western Kru
languages than to Eastern Kru languages, nor the other way around. It may have some properties
that resemble Western Kru languages, some that resemble Eastern Kru languages, and some
properties that are distinct from both. Chapter 3 looks at how Siamou perfective and imperfective
aspect compare with these aspects in Kru. I argue that the Siamou perfective is a L tone suffix.
However, in surface form, sometimes the L tone surfaces, and sometimes it does not. In Kru, the
general pattern is that the Western branch has an unmarked perfective and the Eastern branch has
a L tone perfective. Thus, the surface forms of Siamou perfectives sometimes resemble Western
Kru perfectives and sometimes resemble Eastern Kru perfectives. Siamou differs from both
Western and Eastern Kru languages, however, in the formation of negative perfectives. In the
other languages, negating a perfective structure with a negative auxiliary causes a change in
word order from VO to OV. In Siamou, the word order is always OV, and there is no change in
word order when perfectives are negated.","[117, 118]"
"       The examples above show that Siamou has the same SOV characteristics as other Kru
languages. In addition, unlike the common Kru pattern, Siamou has consistent SOV word order.
       Siamou also has SVO characteristics similar to other Kru languages. This includes
modifiers that follow their head. In (51a), the head noun lɔ ('house') is followed by the adjective
sɔ́ɔ ('big'). In (51b), the adverb gbângbâr ('always') follows the verb leè-n ('eat-IMPF').51.    a.       lɔ́    sɔ́ɔ

"3.2.1 Siamou and Kayne's Conjecture
This section has three subparts. Section 3.2.1.1 briefly explains the theory of anti-symmetry.
Section 3.2.1.2 shows that Siamou has consistent surface SOV (i.e. complement-head) word
order. In anti-symmetry theory, Siamou's SOV word order must be derived by raising. In this
case, we might expect to find other instances of raising in Siamou syntax. I look for evidence this
in 3.2.1.3, with mixed results. Finally, 3.2.1.4 presents two possible structures of the Siamou
aspect phrase, and shows which one Kayne's (1994) theory predicts to be correct.",[142]
"        Siamou differs from the other Kru languages in that it does not make use of different
negation strategies to differentiate between perfective and imperfective clauses. Instead, both are
negated with a clause final particle, bo.119 In fact, Siamou does not distinguish at all between
second-position particles and auxiliaries like Kru does. The word order is always S (Part) O V.
The only difference between (79a) and (79b) is the actual form of the verb. There is no
auxiliary/particle alternation and no change in word order.79.     a.       À      ri             le           dì                bo.

"
3.2.2.3 The Structure of Aspect in Siamou Following Kru (Koopman 1984, Marchese 1986)
It appears that Siamou is even more strongly SOV than other Kru languages. Not only does it
have exclusive SOV word order, it also does not have some SVO characteristics that the other
Kru languages have. If Kru is underlyingly SOV, as argued by Koopman (1984) and Marchese
(1986), then Siamou would certainly be underlyingly SOV. According to this argumentation, the
best representation of aspect is not (54a), as Kayne's (1994) theory of anti-symmetry would
require, but (54b) in which the verb phrase is head final, and aspect adjoins to the right edge of
the verb phrase. In this case, no movement is required because this is exactly the surface order.54.    a.                                            b.",[156]
"The particle may be one (or more) of seven, which are introduced in 2.3.4.2. The default particle
seems to be ri, which may be simply a marker of finiteness. This particle is often dropped in
casual speech, resulting in an SOV word order (28).",[59]
"         To summarize, Siamou has some properties consistent with SOV languages, including
SOV word order, complement-head ordering of lexical heads and some functional heads, and a
preference for suffixes over prefixes. It also has a few properties consistent with SVO languages,
including head-complement ordering of some functional heads, and modifiers that follow their
heads. See 3.2.2.1 for more discussion of SOV and SVO properties.
         Kayne (1994) would lead us to predict that all of the above structures that are head-initial
are un-derived, and all the ones that are head-final are derived by leftward movement. In the next
section, I look for independent evidence of leftward movement in Siamou.",[146]
"1.3.1 The Grammatical Sketch
Chapter 2 provides background information about Siamou grammar and a brief description of
Siamou's phonology, including the inventory of consonants and vowels, syllable structure, and
tone. This chapter also surveys Siamou syntax, with information about basic word order (SOV),
and some detail about the nominal projection and the verbal projection. The discussion of the
nominal projection covers pronouns, modifiers, plurality, definiteness, possession and
nominalized verbs. The discussion of the verbal projection focuses on functional particles,
                                                                                                    11
including a left-edge quotative particle, seven pre-predicate particles, and four right-edge
particles, concluding with a brief description of verb stems. The final portion of this chapter is a
short introduction to the Kru language family that shows how Siamou fits in. Siamou is an
outlier among the Kru languages both geographically and genetically. This chapter is important
because information about Siamou grammar is scarce and difficult to access. This is the first time
some of this information has been made available. It is also an important tool for understanding
this thesis. The remaining chapters focus on issues pertaining to tense and aspect. The
background provided in this chapter is intended to make the data in the following chapters more
comprehensible.","[33, 34]"

8.4 What Siamou Teaches Us About Word Order
       This dissertation makes claims about the syntax of the Siamou aspect phrase. Siamou
aspect is right-headed and it is divided two levels: an upper aspect phrase containing completive,
stative, prospective 1 and prospective 2, and a lower aspect phrase containing perfective and
imperfective. These heads correspond to Liao's (2005) ""temporal aspect"" and ""viewpoint aspect.""
       There are many unresolved issues regarding the syntax of the extended verbal projection
as presented in 2.3.4 and repeated in (40). In particular, the relative ordering of the pre-predicate
particles and the right-edge particles has not been clearly mapped out. Additionally, the location
of the subject in the Siamou phrase has not been determined.","[419, 420]"
"3.3.2.4 A (Possible) Argument from Auxiliation
Languages sometimes use auxiliary verbs to allow more than one kind of aspect in a clause. For
example, in English, the auxiliary have (+past participle) introduces perfect aspect and the
auxiliary be (+present participle) introduces progressive aspect. These aspects can stack, as
shown with the perfect progressive sentence in (64a). However, it is not possible for these
aspects to stack on the same verb, as evidenced by the utterance in (64b) which attempts to stack
the past and present participial forms of the verb think.64.      a.       He has been thinking.
         b.       * He is thinking-ed         If we only looked at (64b), we might conclude that English does not allow aspect
stacking either, but that is clearly not true (see Cinque 1999). It just does not allow stacking on
the same verb. There is some evidence that this may be the case in Siamou as well. The utterance
in (65) expresses both prospective aspect and imperfective aspect. In order to accommodate both,
the utterance uses the verb tɛŋn ('be/become') with prospective aspect morphology. Imperfective
aspect is marked with an imperfective nominal táaŋn that is the subject of the verb.",[167]
"                                                                                                                  175
       Along with truth conditions, felicity conditions are an important component of the
meaning of an utterance. Felicity conditions are the facts about a situation that are required in
order for an utterance to be judged appropriate in that situation. Sometimes the structure of a
sentence affects its felicity conditions (Austin 1975, Matthewson 2004). For example, (8a) and
(8b) have different structures. The sentence in (8b) is a clefted version of (8a), where the subject
(your mom) is moved and put in focus.8.     a.      Your mom answered the phone.
       b.      It was your mom who answered the phone.","[197, 198]"

Other similarities between Siamou and other Kru languages include a number of grammatical
morphemes that appear to be cognates (such as the negative particle bo in Siamou and the
negative particle be in Grebo), and word order, both in the verbal and nominal domains. Person
(1966) also gives a historical explanation for the geographical distance between Siamou and the
other Kru languages, arguing that Kru languages were originally spoken further north than they
are now, in Ivory Coast and Liberia, until the Mandé and the Maninka pushed them out. Most of
them moved south, except for the Siamou, who fled north into Burkina Faso (Person 1966).",[101]
"       My goal in the next chapter is to establish the truth and felicity conditions for two Siamou
morphemes: the low tone suffix that I have been calling perfective aspect, and the -n suffix that I
hav been calling imperfective aspect, and to see how closely they match commonly accepted
truth and felicity conditions for perfectives and imperfectives. In a language, when a certain
phonological form regularly occurs in an utterance in conjunction with a consistent meaning or
set of meanings, we associate that form with the meaning(s) accompanying it. We like to give the
form some kind of name or label to identify it. Since similar sets of meanings occur in many
different languages, if the interpretation of a particular form in one language is similar to one that
occurs in one or more other languages, it is useful, for the sake of cross-linguistic comparison, to
give them the same name. Therefore, I will test whether or not the Siamou low tone suffix fits
the general definition for perfective aspect, and whether or not the Siamou -n suffix fits the
general definition for imperfective aspect. I will also determine how closely the meanings
associated with these forms match meanings associated with other forms with the same label in
other languages. If the Siamou forms have meanings similar to forms in other languages that are
called perfective or imperfective, it is sensible to give the Siamou forms the same name. This is
not to say they are equivalent, but they have some basic features in common.
       In order to reach the goal of establishing truth and felicity conditions, we need a way of
formalizing concepts so that a language can be examined systematically. This is the purpose of a
theoretical framework. It provides a vocabulary and allows us to define the terms perfective and
imperfective. Using these definitions, we can make predictions about the behaviour of these
forms, and then test these predictions by eliciting utterances, along with truth and felicity
judgments, from native speakers of a language. These tests are called diagnostics. Over the next
few pages, I discuss the theoretical framework that I adopt for my analysis of the Siamou verb
forms that correspond to the perfective and imperfective.
       Perfective and imperfective aspect both belong to the category of grammatical aspect.
However, their deployment is sensitive to the lexical properties of the verbs that they combine
                                                                                                  177
with. Therefore, in order to understand the perfective and imperfective, which are instances of
grammatical aspect, we need to consider how lexical aspect interacts with grammatical aspect. In
the following two subsections, I look first at two theories of grammatical aspect (4.2.1) and then
at lexical aspect (4.2.2).","[199, 200]"
"1.3.2 The Morpho-Phonology and Morpho-Syntax of Aspect in Siamou
Chapter 3 hones in on aspect. Siamou has a set of six aspectual morphemes that are all verbal
suffixes. These suffixes are partitioned into three inflectional tone classes: a low tone class,
which includes perfective (marked by a low tone suffix -L), completive -è, and stative -ɲɛ̀n; a
mid tone class, which includes imperfective -n and prospective aspect 1 -a; and a high-low tone
class, which includes prospective aspect 2 -bɛ̂. There are two possible analyses for the morpho-
syntax of Siamou aspect. The first, following Kayne's (1994) anti-symmetry theory, is that
Siamou has an underlying VO word order and that the verb rises to a higher aspect position
while the object rises to an even higher position. The second possibility, which is supported by
data from the Kru language family, and which I adopt, is that the underlying word order is OV
and that the aspectual suffix attaches to the verb via right-alignment.
       Regarding the internal structure of the aspect phrase, data from Siamou is consistent with
an independently motivated structure (Tenny 2000, Liao 2005) in which the aspect phrase is
divided into a lower aspect head and a higher aspect head. In Siamou, the lower head contains
perfective and imperfective aspect, and the higher head contains the remaining aspects:
completive -è, stative -ɲɛ̀n, prospective aspect 1 -a, and prospective aspect 2 -bɛ̂. Although I
have not analyzed the completive and stative suffixes, preliminary results indicate that they both
resemble perfects in some ways, which means that they fit into the category of grammatical
aspect. The perfective -L and the imperfective -n differ from the other aspect suffixes in that they
have less phonological content, and in that they have morphological irregularities, which the
other suffixes do not. If there are two levels of aspect, stacking is predicted to occur. Siamou                                                                                                   12
does not allow stacking of aspectual suffixes on a single verb. However, it appears that stacking
may occur in complex structures that involve an auxiliary verb and a nominal form.
        This chapter also contains a comparison of Siamou perfective and imperfective aspect
with perfective and imperfective aspect in Kru, the language family to which Siamou belongs.
Siamou perfectives and imperfectives are similar in many ways to Kru perfectives and
imperfectives, including elements such as tone and segmental form. However, while Kru negates
perfectives differently than imperfectives, Siamou negates all finite phrases the same way. The
final part of this chapter contains an appendix that gives a detailed description of irregular verb
forms. This chapter is important because it identifies many of the morphemes that are the focus
of the following chapters, in particular the perfective and imperfective. Since these aspectual
suffixes are marked mainly suprasegmentally by tone, they are not easy to pick out in a phrase.
This chapter is the net that catches the butterflies I wish to study.","[34, 35]"

which of the worlds in the modal base best match my desires. By combining the worlds
accessible from the modal base and the worlds accessible from the ordering source, we end up
with two types of worlds: worlds in which I never work on my dissertation and never finish it,
and worlds in which I work on my dissertation and finish it. My desire to finish my dissertation
outweighs my desire to never work on it. Therefore I can truthfully utter (19). The ordering
source discussed here (having to do with desires) is called a bouletic ordering source. See
Kratzer (1991) for more examples of ordering sources.","[358, 359]"
"4.1.1 Ordering Speech Time, Reference Time, and Event Time (Reichenbach 1947)
Reichenbach (1947) defines tense as an ordering relation between three time intervals: speech
time (S), event time (E), and reference time (R). These are defined in (1).1.       a.     Speech time: time at which an utterance is made
         b.     Event time: time at which the situation described by the utterance takes place
         c.     Reference time: time about which an utterance makes a claimBefore Reichenbach (1947), it might have been supposed that tense only ordered two time
intervals: the speech time (S), and the event time (E). If this were so, then past tense would order
the event time before the speech time, present tense would have the two overlap, and future tense
would order the event time after the speech time. These ordering relations are shown in Table
4.1. In the notation for this table, and in following tables, a comma (,) between two time intervals
indicates overlap. A hyphen (-) indicates that the time interval on the left precedes that on the
right.",[191]
"In this case, the modal base contains propositions that have to do with real-world facts: for
example, I am a graduate student. Graduate students write dissertations in order to graduate.
Finishing a dissertation requires working on it. These facts are all consistent with each other. The
ordering source in this case consists of the set of propositions expressed by the phrase what I
want. I have two relevant desires: I want to finish my dissertation, but I also want to never work
on it. The propositions in the modal base (the facts about the world) are not inconsistent with
each other. Nor are my desires inconsistent with each other. It is only when we try to combine
the worlds picked out by the modal base (i.e. the factual worlds) with the worlds picked out by
the ordering source (i.e. the worlds in which I get what I want) that we encounter inconsistencies.
Unfortunately, there are no worlds in which I can have everything I want because the world is

    If there is a non-empty modal base, the ordering source ranks a subset of the worlds picked out by the modal
base.

    This is what is meant when it is said that a modal base or an ordering source is ""empty."" If it's empty, that means
it doesn't restrict the set of worlds.",[358]
"2.4.3.7 Linguistic Identity
Siamou speakers are proud of their language, and they are thrilled when foreigners take an
interest in learning Siamou rather than the trade language, Jula, which is more widely spoken.
