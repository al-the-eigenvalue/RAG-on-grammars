                                PREFACE
The complete destruction of the villages of Barwar in northern Iraq in
1988 brought to an end the world of an Assyrian Christian community
that spoke a dialect of neo-Aramaic. The dispersal of the villagers to the
Iraqi towns and to a diaspora outside Iraq has considerably threatened
the survival of their dialect. Many of its distinctive morphological features
and numerous items of vocabulary relating to the traditional agricultural
life of the community are in danger of being lost. Also endangered is the
rich tradition of oral folklore that existed in the community in former
times but, for the most part, is now falling into oblivion.
    Over the last five years I have worked with informants who grew up and
lived in the villages. In this book I attempt to capture the world of their
community as they knew it in former times. It has been my privilege to
have met some of the oldest surviving members of this community who
still remember well their neo-Aramaic dialect and the oral folkloric tradi-
tions. On the basis of the material gathered from numerous fieldtrips, I
present here a detailed linguistic description of their dialect, an extensive
corpus of transcribed recordings and a glossary of lexical items.
    I should like to express thanks to all my informants without whose
kind collaboration this work could never have been undertaken. These
include Yuw6l Yu˙anna, Nan6s B6nyam6n, B6nyam6n B6nyam6n, Bibe

and subsequently answered many other questions. Thanks are due also
to Fabrizio Pennacchietti for arranging the meeting with the informant

to register my thanks to my students, interaction with whom at our neo-
Aramaic seminars was a great stimulus to me in my research.

majority of the book was written.
  Finally I should like to thank my family for their constant support as I
worked long hours on this project.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]"
"17.1.1.3. Split Predicate
When the predicate is a composite phrase consisting of several constitu-
ents, the copula is sometimes placed on the head of the predicate before
the dependent elements.
  This is frequently the case when the head of the predicate is modified
by a dependent prepositional phrase, e.g.  (1)   ""áyya q7†5la †la-˙aywàne.} ‘This is (the activity of ) the summer for
        the animals.’ (B5:112)
  (2)   ""Ón-Núne npílt5la l-†úra l-†ùra.} ""“n-Nune lies between one mountain
        and another.’ (B5:148)
  (3)   har-blíg6t b-kàsux.} ‘You are always concerned about your stomach.’
        (A23:10)
  (4)   ""an-markáne mtúrßela m-""ùpra.} ‘The jars are made from clay.’
        (B5:168)
  (5)   ""aw-zeðáya mtúrß5wa m-xê††e.} ‘The flat-bread was made out of wheat.’
        (B5:15)
828                         chapter seventeen  (6)   ""ína ramán5wa biš-m6n-qáßr6t kùl-naše.} ‘But it was higher than the
        villa of anybody (else).’ (B10:51)If the speaker wishes to give particular focal prominence to the dependent
prepositional phrase, this may be fronted before the head of the predicate
with the nuclear stress and copula placed on it, e.g.  (7)   ßáw°a gu-púmm6t màr5la š6klánta.} ‘A word is beautiful (only) in the
        mouth of its master (= It is easier said than done).’ (A26:40)The split of the predicate is regularly found when the head of the predicate
is a noun with a subordinate clause as its dependent, e.g.  (8)   dán5la qá-t d5r7la m5rˆ°a.} ‘It is time to add the rennet.’ (B5:164)It is occasionally found in nominal annexation constructions, whereby the
copula is placed on the head noun, e.g.  (9) ""ána málk6n d-ày-ba≥6r.} ‘I am the king of that town.’ (A32:9)
  (10) ""áwwa xa-nišànq5le} t-""á°‰a d-ˆ-ga.} ‘This was a symbolic act of our
       country at that time.’ (B5:153)In (9) the annexation particle is attached to a dependent phrase that begins
with a demonstrative and in (10) the particle is attached to a dependent
noun that is separated from its head by an intonation group boundary.
In both cases, therefore, the connection between the head and dependent
elements of the annexation are looser than in a construction in which the
annexation particle is suffixed to the head noun (k°aw6t qaša ‘the book of
the priest’). The copula does not split the head and dependent elements
in the latter type of tight annexation, e.g.  (11) ""ap-""ána brón6t màlk5w6n.} ‘I also am the son of a king.’ (A24:45)
  (12) ‘ál°6t qáša Hˆdot?} ‘Are you the daughter-in-law of the priest H5do?’
       (B9:10)A copula normally intervenes between a head noun and an adjective only
when the adjective is in a separate intonation group. In such constructions
the adjective can be regarded as a reduced form of a separate predication
(see §14.7., examples 47–50), e.g.
                                 the clause                                 829  (13) xa-kàrm5le} rába gò‰a.} ‘It is an orchard (which is) very large.’
       (A12:9)When the adjective occurs in the same intonation group as the head noun,
the copula is placed at the end of the phrase, e.g.  (14) ""ána xa-náša gò‰5w6n.} ‘I am an old man.’ (A8:43)
  (15) ""áy q6ßßètta rìxt5la.} ‘It is a long story.’ (A25:52)
  (16) xa-qèßß6t rába mapš6mànt5la.} ‘It is a very sad story.’ (A4:31)On some sporadic occasions the copula is placed on a quantifier or intensi-
fier particle that stands before the head of the predicate, e.g.  (17) ráb5wa náše xêðye.} ‘The people were very happy.’ (B15:12)
  (18) ráb6xwa xèðye pßìxe.} ‘We were very happy and cheerful.’ (B16:6)
  (19) t8r6t ""ùmra} ráb5wa kòpa.} ‘The door of the church was very low.’
       (B15:2)
  (20) kúlla qumašàt ""7-ga bíš-w5wa rešàye.} ‘All the material at that time was
       of the very best quality.’ (B10:45)This retraction of the copula can be regarded as a device for express-
ing the prominence of the intensifier particle. The predicate as a whole
expresses new information, so the particle is not being singled out as the
only information focus in the clause. This is reflected also in the prosody,
in that the nuclear stress is placed at the end of the predicate, which is
intended to mark the whole phrase as new information. Rather, within
the new information of the predicate, the intensifier is being given an
enhanced prominence. This can be compared to a construction with a
compound verbal form such as (21), in which the copula is moved back
onto the quantifier raba to give it an enhanced prominence within the
new information of the predicate:  (21) zríy6nwale b-i°à°i} ""u-ráb6nwa k‘íxa bíye dìye.} ‘I had cultivated it with
       my hands and greatly toiled in it.’ (A17:32)When the subject constituent is postposed, in some isolated cases it is placed
after the head noun of the predicate but before a dependent modifier.
This applies to (22), in which the independent subject pronoun intervenes
between a noun and its adjective. As with other cases of postposed subjects,
the clause has a status of a comment on what precedes it:
830                           chapter seventeen  (22) káze xoš-ßlìg6n} yalúnka ""áti zòr5w6t.} ‘He tried (to persuade him to go)
       “Go down, you are a young child.” ’ (A29:28)17.1.2. Independent Copula17.1.2.1. Basic Predicate
An independent standing copula without a subject constituent is attested
in the text corpus in two contexts.(i) Present Copula before the Predicate
These tend to occur as answers to rhetorical questions such as (1) and (2):  (1)   ""5-màsta} ""i-d5ríla gu-gùða.} gúða mòdile?} ""íle gèld6t xa-hèw6n.} ‘They put
        the yoghurt in a churn. What is a churn? It is an animal skin.’
        (B6:38)
  (2)   x7la díya mòdile} t-mazvêrra?} ""íla mìya.} ‘What is its power, which turns
        it? It is water.’ (B6:53)This type of question and answer structure has a similar function to
clauses with an independent copula after the subject such as guða ""ile g6ld6t
heyw6n, x5la diya ""ila miya (§17.1.2.2.), which typically supply an explanatory
or elaboratory comment on what precedes.(ii) Past Copula after the Predicate
These constructions do not appear to be significantly different in function
from corresponding ones with an enclitic copula. The ‘heavier’ coding
brought about by the prosodic separation may have been exploited by the
speaker to give the clause added prominence, e.g.  (1)   gu-bˆ°a wéwa.} ‘He was in the house.’ (A6:1)
  (2)   rába tàza ""iyéwa.} ‘It was very good.’ (B5:55)17.1.2.2. Clauses Containing a Subject Constituent
Clauses containing an independent standing copula generally have a
subject constituent in the form of an independent pronoun or a nominal.
The constructions discussed in §17.1.2.1. which lack a subject constituent
are far more rarely attested in the text corpus. The subject constituent is
regularly placed at the front of the clause before the predicate. The copula
is placed either before the predicate, immediately after the subject (1–6),
                                 the clause                                 831or is placed after the predicate (7–10). This applies both to the present
and the past copula.  (1)  ""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl.’ (A29:63)
  (2)  ""áxni ""íw6x màlke.} ‘We are kings.’ (A18:8)
  (3)  ""áxxa ""í°ena dàwla.} dáwla ""íle xa-sandùqa} réše p°íx5le d7r5 xê††e gáwe.}
       ‘Here there is a drum. The drum is a box, with an open top, in
       which they put wheat.’ (B6:54)
  (4) b7°6t Qára Té≥din qìdle.} Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} ‘The house of
       Qara Te≥din has burnt down. Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law.’
       (A26:55)
  (5) m6lxáwa ""íwa mtúrßa m-qˆsa.} ‘The winnowing fork was made from
       wood.’ (B5:87)
  (6) w-áw ""iwéwa malàxa.} ‘He was an angel.’ (A8:25)
  (7) ""ána Qára Tè≥din ""íw6n.} ‘I am Qara Te≥din.’ (A26:68)
  (8) ""ána brònux ""íw6n.} ‘I am your son.’ (A18:7)
  (9) sab-qyámta b-lˆle ""iyáwa.} ‘because Easter was at night.’ (B5:53)
  (10) tròßa} ""áni milàne ""iy7wa} ‘In fact, they were green.’ (B5:218)The placement of the copula immediately after the subject in clauses such
as (1)–(6) expresses the topical prominence of the subject. This reinforced
coding of the topic in initial position functions as a discourse boundary
marker. The construction is used either in statements that supply explana-
tory information concerning what precedes or in statements that open
a section of discourse. When acting as explanatory comments on what
precedes, they differ from constructions with postposed subjects such as
(§17.1.1.2., examples 18–24) in their degree of independence and promi-
nence. The postposed subject constructions are incidental comments that
are tagged onto what precedes. The constructions with the initial subject
and following copula are presented as important pieces of information,
which typically have relevance for what follows as well as being explana-
tory of what precedes.
   As remarked, the position of the copula after the subject expresses the
topical prominence of the subject. The prosodic detachment of the copula
as an independent word can be interpreted as a ‘heavy’ grammatical coding
device intended to give the clause as a whole prominence and distinctness.
Construction such as (7)–(10) which have have a prosodically independent
copula after the predicate exhibit this latter device. They can, therefore, be
regarded as expressing some degree of prominence. Indeed, they can all
be interpreted as being intended as important statements in the contexts
832                          chapter seventeenin which they occur. They lack the additional device of reinforcing the
topical prominence of the subject as a means of marking their distinct-
ness. It should be noted, however, that in the attested examples of this
construction a pronominal subject is always expressed by an independent
pronoun (cf. 7, 8, 10) rather than zero anaphora. This in itself is a ‘heavy’
coding device designed to mark a boundary (see §17.7.4.).
   The subject constituent in clauses with an independent copula is not
postposed after the predicate. This can be explained by the fact that, as
seen in §17.1.1.2, the postposition of a topic subject constituent, is typi-
cally used as a device to bind cohesively the clause with what precedes
as a form of incidental tag. This is incompatible with the function of the
independent copula as a marker of distinctness and independence from
what precedes. An apparent exception to this is (11):  (11) r6š-kúlla d-áni ""íla S6ttìye.} ‘Above all of these is S6ttiye.’ (A25:22)Here the inflection of the copula agrees with the noun S6ttiye and in this
respect the latter would normally be construed as the grammatical subject.
In terms of information structure, however, the initial prepositional phrase
containing the anaphoric pronoun is clearly more topical than the noun
S6ttiye, which is the asserted focus of new information.
   The initial subject constituent is sometimes separated from the rest of
the clause by an intonation group boundary. This is a further prosodic
device to reinforce the prominence of the initial topic in order to give the
clause as a whole distinctness in the discourse and disjoin it from what
precedes, e.g.  (12) ""u-zeðàya} ""íla biš-xlìmta.} ‘A flat-bread is thicker.’ (B6:49)
  (13) Nìnwe} ""iwáwa pét6xt ""a°oràye.} ‘Nineveh was the capital of the Assyr-
       ians.’ (B6:17)
  (14) M9mo} ""íwewa gu-""Al?n} ""u-Zìne} ""iwáwa gu-Jazíre Bòta.} ‘M>mo was in
       ""Alàn and Zine was in Jazire Bota.’ (A26:1)17.1.3. Deictic Copula17.1.3.1. Basic Predicate
When the deictic copula occurs in a clause without a subject constituent,
it is normally placed before the predicate (1–3).
                                 the clause                                 833  (1) hóla làxxa.} ‘They are here.’ (A14:100)
  (2) hóle gu-Kàrkuk.} ‘He is in Kirkuk.’ (A16:1)
  (3) hóla gwìrta.} ‘She is married.’ (A26:31)On sporadic occasions deviations from this structure are found. In (4)–(6),
for example, it is placed after the predicate. In (7) it is used in combina-
tion with an enclitic copula:  (4) bas-†lìya hóle.} ‘But he is asleep.’ (A31:6)
  (5) ""árye dìye} k6s-báxte dìye hóla.} ‘His lions are with his wife.’ (A18:19)
  (6) šxàna hóli!} ‘I am getting hot!’ (A32:23)
  (7) hóle qúrb6t nùr5le.} ‘He is near the fire.’ (A23:9)17.1.3.2. Clauses Containing a Subject Constituent
When the clause contains a subject constituent, the deictic copula is nor-
mally placed before the predicate. There is variation, however, regarding
the position of the subject, in that it may be placed before or after the
copula.(i) Subject—Copula
When the subject is placed before the copula, the clause in principle
marks some kind of discourse boundary. This construction often occurs
at the beginning of a section of text that concerns the referent of the
subject, e.g.  (1) xa-bráta hóla tàma} ""ána mèri ""êllux,} bráta zamàrt5la.} ""áp-xa l5le-
      mßáya bíya dìya.} ‘A girl is there. The girl is a singer—as I said to
      you. Nobody can prevail over her.’ (A25:68)
  (2) baxtá°6n hóla yaqúre t6rwê°na.} ""6n-báxtux mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxti
      mu°éla bròna,} brátux qa-bròni.} ""6n-báxti mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxtux mu°éla
      bròna,} ""a-bráti qa-brònux.} ‘Our wives are both pregnant. If your wife
      gives birth to a girl and my wife gives birth to boy, your daughter
      (will be married) to my son. If my wife gives birth to a daughter
      and your wife gives birth to a son, my daughter (will be married)
      to your son.’ (A25:2–3)
  (3) ""Ón-Nùne} hóla npílta gu-""á°‰6t Bêrw6r.} ""“n-Nune lies in the land of
      Barwar.’ (B4:1)The construction is sometimes used to introduce a discourse section that
is inserted within a larger section. This applies, for example, to (4), which
834                            chapter seventeenis an extract from a description of the activities of the bride in a wed-
ding. The construction in question with the deictic copula marks a shift
to a section concerned with the activities of the groom. The discourse
subsequent shifts attention back to the bride:  (4) y-amríla zawèrt6t k yàlo.} ""ày} ta-t-toràla} k yálo xaráye t-óra gu-bˆ°a.} maxyàle
      ""o-mèšxa.} xètna hóle zína l-gàre.} m6n-gáre maxé-""aqle r6š-swána
      hàtxa,} ßále xán‘i ""úpra gu-réš6t k yàlo.} xaráye t-àwra.} ‘They call it “the
      bride’s pot.” It was for the bride to break in order that she could
      finally enter the house. She would apply the oil, while the groom
      was standing on the roof. From the roof he strikes his foot on the
      eves like this and a little earth falls onto the head of the bride.
      Finally she enters.’ (B8:33–34)The inserted section may consist of only a clause, as in (5), in which the
speaker uses the construction to turn attention to the activity of the doves.
The effect is to present this as an activity with a degree of independence
from the activity of the youth described in what precedes, which is con-
comitant with it rather than being a component of it:  (5) xa-yála rába šapìra} hóle ""ê°ya,} súse mrúpy6lle gu-màrgax.} hóle dèry6lla gáne
      gu-bèrke dìyax.} hóle sxàya,} yoná°a hóla reše-reše-dìye.} mút ""áti tíwta
      làxxa?} qu-xzà!} ‘A very handsome youth has come and released his
      horse in your meadow. He has immersed himself in your pool and
      is swimming. Doves are (flying) over him. Why are you sitting here?
      Get up and see!’ (A25:58)The initial subject constituent is occasionally placed in a separate into-
nation group. This is the case in (6), in which the two clauses with the
deictic pronouns distinguish between the situation of his aunt and uncle
by presenting them in a contrastive opposition. The prosodic separation
of the subject topic constituent enhances the distinctness of the two poles
of the opposition:  (6) qìm5le,} šèmm6t má°a díye wéwa Barwòre.} ""ámte dìye} hóla gu-Sàrzar} ""u-xále
      dìye} hóle gu-Daštàne.} ‘The name of his village was Barwore. His aunt
      was in Sarzar and his uncle was in Daštane.’ (A23:1)(ii) Copula—Subject
When the subject constituent is placed after the copula, the clause is
presented with a greater cohesion with what precedes. In (1) and (2) the
                                     the clause                                     835construction gives descriptive detail concerning the preceding event. In
(3) it describes a situation that is an immediate consequence of the pre-
ceding event. In (4) the clause introduces the instrument of the following
activity of the cutting of the bread and in this sense is cohesive with what
follows. The placement of the subject after the copula, however, has the
effect of binding the whole section describing the cutting of the bread to
what precedes and presenting it as a direct consequence of it.  (1) wír5le gu-xà-""ot6x xéta} gò‰ta} hóla xákma kurs>wà°a} m-ày-gota}
      xákma m-ày-gota.} ‘He went into another room, a large one.
      Some chairs are on one side and some on the other.’ (A14:29)
  (2) ""áy hóla wáða kùbbe.} hóla ""i°á°a gu-lˆša,} lyáša kùbbe.} ‘She is making
      meat-balls. Her hands are in dough, while kneading the meat-balls.’
      (A21:26)
  (3) mú°y6lla làxxa} ""áw-u w9zìr} ""u-hóla wajjúwe díya làxxa.} ‘He and
      his vizier brought her here, and her effects are here.’ (A21:9)
  (4) zeðàye} t-la-qßàya} de-mà†o hóya?} hóla skínta mênne.} xarè†la zeðàye}
      b-pálga dìya.} ‘(He says) “Pitta bread without breaking it, how could
      that be?” He has a knife with him. He scores the pittas in their
      middle.’ (A30:21)17.1.4. Copula Clauses with an Interrogative Constituent
The predicate of a copula clause may be an interrogative constituent, e.g.
mòdile?} ‘What is it?’ (A4:48), ""ˆnile?} ‘Who is it’ (A22:32), ""ˆk5le?} ‘Where
is he?’ (A4:19).
   When the clause contains a subject constituent, the copula is always
placed on the predicate. The subject is placed either before or after the
predicate. The basic principle determining the position of the subject is
the same as in indicative clauses. The placement of the subject in initial
position before the predicate typically marks some kind of boundary in
the discourse, whereas the subject is postposed after the predicate when
the speaker wishes to present that clause as having greater cohesion with
what precedes.
   The construction with the subject before the predicate is frequently
attested in the text corpus at the beginning of a section of discourse that
supplies an explanatory comment on what precedes, e.g.  (1) hóle ""í°6n làxxa} stêrra.} stèrra mòdile?} xê††ele} ""u-šìšmele} ""u-pràge} ""u-sà‰e,}
      kúlla dèrye gu-mzìðe.} ‘There was a food store. What is a food store?
836                          chapter seventeen      It is wheat, sesame, millet, barley, everything put in leather bags.’
      (A23:17)
  (2) ""í°wal6n mandòrta.} mandórta mòdila?} ""áwwa kèp5le,} m6n-gòte,} m-ay-góta
      m-ay-gòta} xrí†a xa-bòya.} ‘We had a roller. What is a roller? It is a
      stone, bored with a hole in its side, on one side and the other side.’
      (B5:145)
  (3) ""éða gò‰a} yóm6t trùšeba} y-áwe duxràna.} y-áwe duxràna.} ""o-duxrána mòdile?}
      ""an-nàše} kùlla báte} kut-b7°a mbáš6l xa-mêndi.} ‘During the “big festival,”
      Monday was a (time of ) memorial, it was a (time of ) memorial.
      What is this memorial? The people, all the families, each family
      cooks something.’ (B5:64)The referent of the subject has not always been mentioned in the preceding
discourse. In (4), for example, the subject ‘his job’ has not been mentioned.
The crucial factor is that the narrator presents the interrogative clause as
a boundary, introducing a section of discourse in which he describes the
activities of his daily work:  (4) ""í°wale xa-tàwra} ""u-xa-xmàra.} kút-yum šúle díye mòdi-wewa?} šaqêlwale
      táwre díye} ""u-šaqêlwa xmáre díye} qèdamta} y-azèlwa z>rèwa} ""u-y-a°éwa
      l-bˆ°a,} y-axèlwa mèndi ""i-damêxwa.} ‘He had an ox and an ass. Every-
      day what was his job? He would take his ox and take his ass early
      in the morning and go to cultivate (his field). He would then come
      back home, eat something and go to sleep.’ (A21:3–4)The construction with the subject before the predicate is sometimes used
at the beginning of a speech turn, e.g.  (5) ""ám6r ""áw ""ˆnile?} ‘He says “Who is he?” ’ (A22:29)
  (6) ""ám6r ""áti ""ˆniw6t?} ‘He says “Who are you?” ’ (A28:34)When the subject is placed after the predicate, the nuclear stress is either
placed on the predicate or on the subject. As remarked above, the sub-
ject is postposed in various contexts where the clause is presented by the
speaker as cohesive with what precedes. In (7) and (8) the construction is
used in the second of a series of two questions, the purpose of which is
to elicit the same basic information and are presented as a unit:  (7) yába ""ˆk5le} Dáw6ð kòra?} ""7k5le ma˙álle dìye?} ‘Where is blind David?
      Where is his place?’ (A16:3)
                                  the clause                                 837  (8)   mère †la-Zàlo:} Zàlo} ""ánna mòdila gu-réšux,} ""ánna šaqyà°a?} módila ""ánna
        brinàne?} ‘He said to Zàl “Zàl, what these on your head, these scars?
        What are these wounds?” ’ (A29:4)In (9) the question ‘What was her name?’ is presented as cohering closely
with the preceding clauses which introduce the referent of a woman into
the discourse:  (9)   ""í°wa xa-baxtà} rába xàm°5wawa.} módi-wewa šèmma dìya?} B6lbèl Hazàr.}
        ‘There was a woman. She was very beautiful. What was her name?
        B6lb6l Hazar.’ (A8:21)In (10) the subject is postposed in a question at the beginning of a speech
turn. The effect of this is to present it as a tag to what precedes, eliciting
a supplementary detail, rather than setting it up as the onset of a new
section of discourse concerning ‘your house’:  (10) b-óma xéna ""á°eti †la-kawù°ra,} ‘íd6t k6slˆni.} mère ""ˆk5le b5°7xu?} mèra
       fèll6n dùk°a.} ‘(She said) “The day after tomorrow come to lunch,
       you are invited to our home.” He said “Where is your house?”
       She said “In such-and-such a place.’’ ’ (A22:14)If the interrogative constituent is the subject of the clause, this is normally
placed at the front of the clause with the copula cliticized to it, e.g.  (11) ""7nile gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Who is in the house?’
  (12) ""7nile zaqàra?} ‘Who is a weaver?’
  (13) módile r6š-mèz?} ‘What is on the table?’The nuclear stress is in principle put on the predicate. The placement of
the copula on the subject can be explained as a reflection of the topical
prominence of this constituent. It is not topically prominent in the sense
that it is referentially bound to the preceding discourse, but rather due
to the fact that it is the central concern of the clause which is typically
expected to be talked about in the following discourse. This may be termed
‘forward pointing’ topical prominence (see §15.4.1.4.1. iiia).
   The nuclear stress is generally placed on the interrogative subject
constituent when the predicate is a component of the presuppositional
background the clause. The prosodic pattern ""ˆnile gu-b7°a}, for example,
would typically be used when the speaker assumes that the hearer is
entertaining the presupposition that somebody is in the house.
838                          chapter seventeen   When an adverbial interrogative expression meaning ‘why’ is placed at
the front of a copula clause, the copula is, likewise, attached to this item
rather than to the predicate, e.g.  (14) ta-módila ""áyya mðíta hàtxa?} ‘Why is this town like this?’ (A4:31)17.1.5. Existential Usage
In a few cases the enclitic copula is used simply to predicate the existence
of a referent rather than ascribe some property to it or identify it with
another item. This is most commonly found in meteorological expres-
sions, e.g.  (1)   xapù°5la.} ‘It is foggy (literally: There is fog).’
  (2)   mê†r5la.} ‘It is rainy (literally: There is rain).’
  (3)   xêmm5le ""èlli.} ‘I am hot (literally: There is heat is to me).’
  (4)   qàr°5la ""èlli.} ‘I am cold (literally: There is cold is to me).’Other examples:  (5)   gu-xa-gèppa hambišàye-wawa.} ‘There were giants in a cave.’ (A12:18)
  (6)   há ríx6t náša naxrày5le!} ‘Ha, there is the smell of a foreign man!’
        (A24:47)
  (7)   ""i°á°a qàmx5le,} p°ìxt6llela t8ra.} ‘While there was flour on her hands,
        she opened the door.’ (A21:26)In principle the nuclear stress is placed on the existential subject in such
constructions, which reflects its status as a new information focus. In (8)
the copula is placed on a preceding quantifier. In such constructions the
whole clause is a new information focus, including the existential subjects,
which is reflected by the position of the nuclear stress on the subject at
the end of the intonation group. The placement of the copula on the
quantifier, therefore, does not express a narrow new information focus on
the quantifier, but rather expresses a prominence or intensification of the
quantifier within the broad information focus of the clause:  (8)   ""Ëšwu† rába krèt-iwa gu-""á°‰a.} ráb5wa tàlga} ráb5wa mè†ra ""u-m6ndiyàne.}
        ‘(The month of ) February was very bad in our country. There was
        a lot of snow. There was a lot of rain and so on.’ (B5:152)
                                 the clause                               839Sporadically the enclitic copula is found with an existential function with
referentially definite subjects in other contexts, e.g.  (9)   har-W7rda-w Nˆrgis-ila.} làtla,} lá bnòne,} lá ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘Only W5rda
        and N5rgis were there. They had no children, nothing.’ (A24:51)The independent copula is attested with existential meaning in clauses
contaning indefinite subjects, e.g.  (10) gu-d-ó qotíya ""íla xa-ßêpra.} ‘In that box there is a sparrow.’ (A12:40)The deictic copula is used existentially with definite or indefinite subject
constituents. It is placed either before or after the subject, e.g.  (11) hóla ""isèq°a dìya.} ‘Here is her ring.’ (A25:69)
  (12) hó""la mìya.} ‘Here is some water.’ (A28:18)
  (13) xa-b7°a hòle.} ‘There is a house over there.’ (A33:5)
            17.2. Clauses Containing a Negative CopulaThe negative copula is in principle placed before the predicate. The most
basic construction consists of a simple nexus of copula and predicate, e.g.  (1)   l7le dàwa.} ‘It is not gold.’ (A14:26)
  (2)   l7le póìla.} ‘It is not crooked.’ (A17:20)
  (3)   l7le gnàyi.} ‘Its not my fault.’ (A23:23)
  (4)   l7w6t d-áwwa ""à°‰a.} ‘You are not from this country.’ (A25:82)
  (5)   l7wa rába gò‰a.} ‘It was not very big.’ (B5:140)When the clause contains a subject constituent, this is generally placed
before the predicate, e.g.  (6) ""áwwa lˆle qáša.} ‘He is not a priest.’ (B17:7)
  (7) ""áw l7le ""ùpri.} ‘It is not my land.’ (A25:52)
  (8) Yuwán6s lˆle táma.} ‘Yuwan6s is not there.’ (A52:6)
  (9) dárdi l7la d-àyya.} ‘My suffering is not from this.’ (A26:66)
  (10) yèmmi l7wa qrì°a.} ‘My mother was not educated.’ (B8:15)
840                           chapter seventeenThe nuclear stress is placed either at the end of the predicate phrase or on
the copula. It is typically placed on the copula when the predicate consists
of an item that has been introduced in the preceding discourse, e.g.  (11) mère má-l6x bráta t-it-hátxa bxàya} qam-d-ánna ""êrwe?} mèra ""ánna lˆwa
       ""èrwe,} xon>wà°i w7wa.} ‘He said “What is the matter with you girl
       that you are weeping so much in front of these sheep?” She said
       “These used not to be sheep, they used to be my brothers.” ’
       (A34:20–21)
  (12) mère mùt kálba mubr7°a ""áti?} . . . mèra ""áwwa lˆle kálba,} ""àtit kálba.} ‘He
       said “What dog have you given birth to?” . . . She said “He is not
       a dog. You are a dog.” ’ (A11:20)
  (13) ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.} ""áwwa mì°5le.} ""áwwa mádam ""ì°wale} bàxta,}
       ""í°wale bnòne,} ""í°wale nàše,} ""áwwa lˆle mí°a.} ‘They say that he has
       no relatives. He is dead (in this case). So long as he had a wife,
       he had sons, he had relatives, he is not dead.’ (A17:17)The subject constituent is sporadically placed after the predicate. As with
positive copula clauses with postposed subjects, this construction is used
to express close cohesion to what precedes. It is found in contexts such
as (14), in which the clause is a comment that is presented as a tag to the
preceding remark and not the onset of a new discourse section. Note that
the subject is in a separate intonation group:  (14) hot-q†ìl6lle ""a≥vána!} mêre} lˆle ""a≥vána} ""àwwa.} (She said) “You have killed
       the caretaker.” ’. He said “He is not the caretaker.” ’ (A22:46)The negative copula is placed after the predicate in idiomatic interrogative
constructions such as (15) and (16). In these an interrogative clause with
a negative copula echoes a preceding interogative clause with a positive
copula, maintaining the same word order:  (15) dréla šláma l-f9qih} dàx-it?} dax-lˆw6t?} ‘She greeted the jurist “How
       are you? How are you not?” (A22:16)
  (16) ""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila} ""u-módi lˆla.} ‘If he is my
       nephew, he will come and will know what these are and what they
       are not.’ (A25:49)
                                    the clause                                    841This echoing of the word order of a preceding constituent question with
a positive copula is also found in the answer to such questions, as in (17),
in which the negative copula in the answer is placed after the predicate:  (17) ""àm6r,} Fárxo †la-xále díye ""àm6r} xáli mòdila?} xáz6x ""askaràye.} kúlla ""Amedía
       píšla ""askaràye.} mère xá-m6ndi lˆla.} ‘He said, Farxo said to his maternal
       uncle “What is the matter uncle? We can see soldiers. The whole of
       Amedia has become soldiers.” He said “It is nothing.” ’ (A25:79)The 3fs. form of the negative copula l5la is tagged onto the end of clauses
in various contexts to refer to some general propositional content, e.g.  (18) b8z6xwa tannêkka.} tannèkka t-nù†a l7la?} ‘We would make a hole in
       the can, an oil can, is that not so?’ (B10:86)
  (19) kèma gàye} gu-xáßa díya mútte tópe ‘Æruk,} lˆla.} ‘Several times the guns
       were pointed at her back, bang, but it does not happen (i.e. the
       gun does not shoot).’ (B9:18)The negative particle la is occasionally used in a clause containing a posi-
tive copula in order to express asseveration rather than negation. In such
cases the negative particle never bears the nuclear stress, e.g.  (20) la-hóle mì°a.} ‘He is indeed dead.’ (A17:2)
  (21) la-""aw-d°s-wewa.} ‘He was indeed right.’ (A17:8)
  (22) la-málka màmi} hóle yèmya b-rèši.} ‘Indeed the king my uncle has sworn
       on my head (to execute me).’ (A25:36)
  (23) la-""àxxa-wewa.} ‘He was indeed here.’Such constructions have no doubt developed from the use of the negator
as an interjection to contradict some statement or request of the interlocu-
tor, as is seen in contexts such as (24):  (24) mère ßli-qàm°a} mère la-""àti ßli-qám°a.} ‘He said “Go down and
       meet her.” He (the other) said “No, you go down to meet her.” ’
       (A26:40)
842                          chapter seventeen                     17.3. The Existential ParticlesThe existential particles (""i°, ""i°wa, li°, li°wa and their variants) are placed
either before or after the nominal with which they are combined.","[866, 867, 868, 869, 870, 871, 872, 873, 874, 875, 876, 877, 878, 879, 880, 881]"
"19.3.1. Direct Irrealis Complement
When a clause that is the direct complement of a verb expresses an event
that is unrealized, its verb is in the qa†6l or qa†6lwa form. The clause may
be juxtaposed asyndetically to the main verb or it may be connected to
it by the subordinating particle D. Some aspects of these constructions
have been described in §15.1.1.8. and §15.1.2.5. Here we shall restrict
ourselves to some remarks concerning the word order attested in irrealis
complement clauses of the text corpus.
   When the complement clause contains a subject nominal, this is placed
before the verb and before the subordinating particle D, if this is used:
                       syntactic subordination of clauses                       979  (1) b8y6n ""álaha t-yaw•lli m•ndi zàwda.} ‘I want God to give me something
      more.’ (A3:1)
  (2) la-b8y6n ""áyya bráta t-in-mú°y6lla t-y8ða qá-t †líba díya hóle mì°a.} ‘I do not
      want this girl whom I have brought to know that her betrothed has
      died.’ (A4:33)A direct object nominal is placed in various positions. It is found after the
verb of the complement clause, e.g.  (3) b8yi t-áxli xa-ràmša.} ‘They want to eat dinner.’ (A2:2)
  (4) b8y6n †alb•nna brátux †la-xòni.} ‘I want to ask for the hand of your
      daughter for my brother.’ (A32:11)It is sometimes placed before the verb of the complement clause and the
D particle but after the main verb. In such cases the object has topical
status due to its connection with what precedes (5) or due to its being set
up as a contrastive topic with another item in an adjacent clause (6):  (5) ""ána b8y6n ""ánna déwe maxênna.} ‘I want to attack these wolves.’
      (A14:52)
  (6) b8y6n mênnux} hélma t-yáw6t b-rèši} ""u-be-má'na †ízux yaw•tle l-gùda.} ‘I want
      you to blow breath on me and—excuse me2—turn your bum to the
      wall.’ (A25:12)The object may also be fronted before the main verb. In the attested
examples of this the object is the complement of the particle ""ap and has
focal prominence, e.g.  (7) ""ap-b7°i b8y6t ßa†mêtle?} ‘Do you want to destroy my house as well?’
      (A23:39)
  (8) ""áp-xa la-qábl6t t-áw6r gu-bˆ°a.} ‘You should not allow anybody to
      come into the house.’ (A23:25)In (9) an irrealis clause stands in apposition to a demonstrative pronoun
that refers to the propositional content of the clause. The whole construc-
tion is presented in a single intonation group:  2
      Literally: without meaning.
980                           chapter nineteen  (9) le-y-bárya ""áyya ""o-šúla ""oðêxle.} ‘This is not possible—we do such a thing
      (= it is not possible for us to do such a thing).’ (A8:10)19.3.2. Direct Factive Complement
Direct complement clauses may also be of factual content. These are
typically found as complements of verbs such as ‘to say’, ‘to know’, ‘to
remember’, ‘to swear’, ‘to forget’. Various constructions are attested.","[1017, 1018, 1019]"
"  (26) A: xzéli bàbux} B: là,} màmi xzélux.} ‘A: “I saw your father.” B: “No,
       you saw my uncle.” ’
  (27) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} xàwx5le xíla xóni.} l7le xabùša xíla.} ‘A:
       “Your brother has eaten an apple.” B: “No, my brother has eaten
       a peach. He has not eaten an apple.” ’In such cases the remainder of the clause belongs to the presuppositional
background, i.e. it is assumed to be known to the hearer. What is unknown
is the identity of the argument in question. In (25) the presuppositional
background of the clause with the fronted object is ‘You saw x’ and in (26)
it is ‘My brother has eaten x’. What the speaker is asserting, i.e. the new
information that he is conveying, is the identity of x in each case. Note
that in clauses with compound verbal forms, the copula is attached to the
fronted object. Examples from the text corpus (see §15.4.1.4.1 i):  (28) l7w6n °í°a b-xabr6 dìye.} ""áyya xá°e dìyela.} b-xábr6t xá°6 dìy6n °í°a.} ‘I
       did not come at his word. She is his sister. I came at the word of
       his sister.’ (A8:85)
  (29) ""àn6n mú°y6lle.} ‘I (and not my brother) have brought it back.’
       (A24:31)
878                         chapter seventeenThe fronted object in focus may be introduced by an inclusive or restric-
tive particle (‘also, only’), e.g.  (30) ""ap-mêlxa piðále.} ‘He passed by also the salt.’ (A24:19)
  (31) mèri qa-yêmmi} bas-mìya mátt6t qam-réša díya.} ‘I said to my mother
       “Place only water by her head.” ’ (A21:37)The inclusive particle ""ap is also used with initial object constructions that
have the nuclear stress on the verb and so do not express narrow focus on
the object but rather a broader focus on the proposition as a whole, e.g.  (32) hot-ß†ìm6lle b7°6t xálux.} ""ap-b7°i b8y6t ßa†mêtle?} ‘You have ruined
       the house of your uncle. Do you want to ruin also my house?’
       (A23:39)
  (33) ""úp Mar-Sáwa q6m-talêxle.} ‘He also destroyed (the church of) Saint
       Sawa.’ (B6:33)
  (34) béna ""àw} ma-t-íwa hal-hàd6x,} b>yéwa qa-""alàha} ""u-""aláha b>yèwale,}
       ""ap-míya muklèle gu-d-5-sálla.} ‘He was so (holy), he loved God and
       God loved him, that he could even hold water in the basket.’
       (A16:10)17.7.6. Double Objects
In constructions that take two direct object nominal constituents these are
normally both placed after the verb, e.g.  (1)   ""áxni šaqlèxxe ""u-áá¬6xxa ‘ántux zùze.} ‘We shall take it and fill your
        bag with money.’ (A39:14)
  (2)   madoqíla xètna-w k yálo got6-©ðàðe} ‘They make the groom and bride
        hold each other’s side.’ (B5:50)The first object constituent may be fronted before the verb in contexts
where single object constituents are fronted. In (3), for example, the
fronting of the object ‘his bag’ occurs in a clause that is intended to be
cohesive with what precedes in a close temporal sequence. In (4) the object
is fronted in a topic-orientated construction that is presented as parallel
with what precedes:  (3)   wídla ""ixàla} †la-yàla.} xìlle.} ‘ánte díye dwíqla zwàðe.} ‘She made
        food for the youth. He ate. She packed his bag with provisions.’
        (A21:22)
                                     the clause                                      879  (4) t-óð6n ""ixàla,} xá""a m6n-d-ánna kúbbe gò‰e.} xá""a †la-xmà°ila} ""u-xá †la-gàw‰i.}
      ""a-t-ìla †láli} ""awðánna trè-q6sme,} t-yánna xa-†làlux} ""u-xá †la-
      w9zìr.} ‘I’ll make food, one of these big meat-balls. One is for my
      mother-in-law, one is for my husband. The one that is for me I’ll
      make into two parts and give one to you and one to the vizier.’
      (A21:28)17.7.7. Subject—Object—Verb
Occasionally the object is fronted before the verb when the clause has an
initial subject constituent. Most attested cases of such constructions have
independent pronouns as subject, e.g.  (1) mère yába b-zabnètle ""èlli ""6n-háwe b-ðà-""aqla?} mère zílla °èla} ða-""àqla!} ""áti
      ""áqla šqùlla} ‘He said “Will you sell it to me if it has one leg?”
      He said “All this fuss (literally: they have gone, they have come),
      now one leg! Take the leg.” ’ (A22:5)
  (2) t-óð6n ""ixàla,} xá""a m6n-d-ánna kúbbe gò‰e.} xá""a †la-xmà°ila} ""u-xá †la-gàw‰i.}
      ""a-t-ìla †láli} ""awðánna trè-q6sme,} t-yánna xa-†làlux} ""u-xá †la-w9zìr.} . . . ""ána
      sámi t-yánne †lalˆxu} ""ána lè-y-axl6n.} ‘I’ll make food, one of these
      big meat-balls. One is for my mother-in-law, one is for my husband.
      The one that is for me I’ll divide into two parts and give one to

      ‘Go and collect the taxes of the people of Botan and I shall give
      my sister to M>mo.’ (A26:73)In all cases the object is anaphorically bound to the preceding context
and the clause is semantically cohesive with what precedes. As we have
seen, clause initial subject pronouns are in principle used to signal some
kind of disjoining from what precedes, so there appears to be some ten-
sion here. The main motivation to use the subject pronouns seems to be
to give prominence to the clause as a whole.","[916, 917, 918]"

with present relevance. In such cases the endpoint of the event coincides
with or is close to the present, e.g.  (4) malkú°i p7ša †làl6x,} wél6x hawnànta,} b-""iqár6t ßáw°a basìmta,} ""u-màqul.}

      (A8:9)Rather than denoting a complete event bounded by a start and an end,
the form is sometimes used ingressively to denote the start of a situation
without any definite endpoint. Another event mentioned in the ensuing
discourse, therefore, may take place while this situation still holds rather
than sequential to its completion, e.g.  (6) dí zìlla dána} °èla dána} ""u-sa""êt5la} wéla ""aßêrta.} b-áyya dàna,} ""è°y7le f9qih.}

The resultative participle (q†ila I, mqu†la II, muq6†la III) relates to a situation
that results from a past event. It exhibits a semantic profile that includes
both dynamicity and stativity. In this respect it shares features with verbs,
which typically express dynamic events, and with adjectives, which denote
properties with a degree of durability and stability in time. The morpho-
logical form should be regarded as indeterminate with regard to dynamism
and stativity in that it may have a dynamic (verbal) or stative (adjectival)
interpretation according to the context in which it is used.
   The resultative participle occurs in the predicate of a clause with the
basic copula or the deictic copula. The interpretation of the participle
654                           chapter fifteenwith regard to dynamicity depends on (i) the actionality of the verb by
virtue of its lexical meaning and (ii) the transitivity of the clause.
   It is convenient to adopt here the classification of the actionality of
verbal events proposed by Vendler (1957, 1967). These include statives,
activities, achievements and accomplishments. Verbs with stative actionality
denote a durative, homogeneous state, e.g. to believe. Activities are durative,
homogeneous dynamic events, e.g. to run. The homogeneity of states and
activities is shown by the fact that any interval during which they take
place can be divided into homogeneous sub-intervals. They are said to
be ‘atelic’ events, in that they do not have an inherent, internal endpoint.
Achievements and accomplishments, by contrast, are ‘telic’ since they have
an inherent endpoint by virtue of their meaning. They contain an internal
boundary, whereby they are non-homogeneous at two sub-intervals of
the action. They include a dynamic component and an endpoint (telos)
attained by the completion of the event. The difference between achieve-
ments and accomplishments lies in the feature of durativity. The dynamic
component of achievements is not durative, e.g. to sit down, whereas dura-
tivity is present in the dynamic interval of accomplishments and can be
quantified by a temporal adverbial indicating a period of time, e.g. to boil
(‘The water boiled in five minutes’). A further type of actionality is that
of ‘punctual’ verbs, which denote atelic dynamic events that have only
minimal duration. As with other types of atelic events, punctual events
are homogeneous and do not result in a clear state that is defined by the
event, e.g. to sneeze.
   This scheme of classification may be summarized in the following
table:                               durative         dynamic        homogeneous
stative                           +                 –                +
activity                          +                 +                +
achievement                       –                 +                –
accomplishment                    +                 +                –
punctual event                    –                 +                +
The resultative participle may occur in a predicate of an intransitive
clause. Such constructions contain only a subject argument, which is the
affected participant in the event. The participle in these clauses may have
a verbal or adjectival interpretation. The crucial conditioning factor is the
actionality of the verb.

both a verbal and an adjectival interpretation. In the verbal interpreta-
tion, the predicate expresses the telic event including both its dynamic and
final static endpoint, the subject of the clause being either the agent or
the experiencer of the event. In the adjectival interpretation, it expresses
only the resultant state of the endpoint. Verbs of this nature falling into
the category of achievements, according to the classification described
above, include, for example, ""tw ‘to sit down’, kly ‘to stand up’, †l"" ‘to go
to sleep’, dmx ‘to lie down, go to sleep’, rkw ‘to mount (an animal)’, m†y
‘to arrive’, npl ‘to fall down’, pq"" ‘to split’, sps ‘to rot’, ""ßy/ßy"" ‘to get stuck’,
gðl ‘to become frozen’:  (1) ""áw hóle tìwa}                  ‘He has sat down’ (verbal)
                                      ‘He is seated’ (adjectival)
  (2) ""áw hóle †lìya}                 ‘He has gone to sleep’ (verbal)
                                      ‘He is asleep’ (adjectival)
  (3) ""áw hóle npìla}                 ‘He has fallen’ (verbal)
                                      ‘He is (lying) fallen’ (adjectival)The adjectival function of the resultative participle of such verbs is dem-
onstrated by the fact that it can function as an attributive modifier of the
participant that is affected by the event, i.e. the subject noun, e.g.  (4) ""aw-náša hóle tìwa}             ‘The man is seated’
      xzáy6nne ""aw-náša tìwa}         ‘I see the seated man’
  (5) ""aw-yála hóle †lìya}            ‘The child is asleep’
      xzáy6nne ""aw-yála †lìya}        ‘I see the sleeping child’
  (6) ""aw-yála hóle npìla.}           ‘The child is (lying) fallen’
      xzáy6nne ""aw-yála npìla.}       ‘I see the fallen child’Furthermore the adjectival interpretation of the copula predicate is shown
by the fact that it can be combined with the adverbial heš ‘still’ in cases
where the resulting state is not permanent, e.g. héš hóle tìwa} ‘He is still
seated’, héš hóle †lìya} ‘He is still asleep’.
   The category of telic achievements include various verbs that denote
ingressiveness into a state. The subject of these is typically an experiencer
rather than an agent, e.g. pßx ‘to become merry’, xðy ‘to become happy’,
krb ‘to become angry’, my° ‘to become dead, die’:
656                           chapter fifteen  (7)   ""áw hóle xêðya}            ‘He has become happy’ (verbal)
                                   ‘He is happy’ (adjectival)
        naša x6ðya                 ‘A happy man’ (adjectival attribute)
  (8)   ""áw hóle mì°a}             ‘He has died’ (verbal)
                                   ‘He is dead’ (adjectival)
        naša mi°a                  ‘A dead man’ (adjectival attribute)Various telic intransitive verbs have a dynamic component with some
degree of quantifiable durativity and so should be classified as accomplish-
ments, although in some cases the subject is inanimate. These include,
for example, m-qrn ‘to grow up’, m-nty ‘to succeed’, r°x ‘to boil’, ómó ‘to
wither’, qry ‘to study (i.e. to apply one’s mind purposefully to the acquisi-
tion of knowledge), be educated’:  (9)   bróni hóle mq5rêna}        ‘My son has grown up’ (verbal)
                                   ‘My son is grown up’ (adjectival)
       brona mq5r6na               ‘A grown-up son’ (adjectival attribute)
  (10) míya hóla r°ìxe             ‘The water has boiled’ (verbal)
                                   ‘The water is boiling’ (adjectival)
       miya r°ixe                  ‘Boiling water’ (adjectival attribute)
  (11) ""áw hóle qêrya}             ‘He has studied’ (verbal)
                                   ‘He is educated’ (adjectival)
        naša q6rya                 ‘An educated man’ (adjectival attribute)If the resultative participle in an intransitive clause is from an atelic verb,
which by its nature does not express an event with an inherent resultant
state, only a verbal interpretation is possible. The participle does not func-
tion as an adjective expressing a state, as shown by the fact that it cannot
serve as an attributive adjectival modifier of the affected participant of the
event nor can it be combined with the adverbial heš ‘still’. Attested atelic
intransitive verbs include those classified as activities and statives.
   Activity verbs include, for example, zmr ‘to sing’, bxy ‘to weep’, spr ‘to
wait’, plx ‘to work’:  (12) ""aw-náša hóle zmìra}        ‘The man has sung’ (verbal)
       *naša zmira
  (13) ""aw-náša hóle plìxa}        ‘The man has worked’ (verbal)

       *naša tpi°a
  (15) ""aw-náša hóle mtùnxa}       ‘The man has sighed’
       *naša mtunxaStative verbs include, for example, zd"" ‘to fear, be afraid’:  (16) ""aw-náša hóle zdìya}        ‘The man has feared’
       *naša zdiyaThe resultative participle is combined with the copula also in the predicate
of transitive clauses, which contain an argument in addition to that of the
subject. In such constructions the participle always has a verbal interpreta-
tion. The participle and the copula agree with the subject, e.g.  (17) ""aw-náša hóle dwíqa bàxta.} ‘The man has seized a woman.’ (verbal)Perfective transitive events are typically telic, in that they result in a state
which constitutes an inherent endpoint. The affected participant in the
event is generally the goal of the action, in (17) ‘a woman’, rather than
the subject referent. A resultative participle can only be used adjectivally
when it is a predicative or attributive adjective of the affected participant
of a telic event. It follows that the participle can be used adjectivally in
a passive construction such as (18), in which the affectee of the event is
subject. This is shown by the fact that it can be combined with the adverb
heš ‘still’, which can only be used in relation to states, e.g.  (18) ""ay-báxta hóla dwìqta}     ‘The woman is seized’ (adjectival)
       ""ay-báxta héš hóla dwìqta} ‘The woman is still seized’ (adjectival)
       ""ay-baxta dwiqta           ‘The seized woman’ (attributive adjective)Such passive constructions can also have a perfective verbal interpreta-
tion, e.g.  (19) ""ay-báxta hóla dwìqta}      ‘The woman has been seized’
658                          chapter fifteenThe agent is optionally expressed in a phrase introduced by the preposi-
tion l- or m6n. This can be used both when the participle has a verbal
interpretation and also when it is adjectival, e.g.   (20) ""aw-qðíla hóle mtúrßa l-baznàye} ‘The key has been made by Baz
        people’ (verbal)
        ""aw-qðíla hóle mtúrßa l-baznàye} ‘The key is made by Baz people’
        (adjectival)
        qðila mturßa l-baznaye ‘A key made by Baz people’ (adjectival attri-
        bute)In transitive clauses such as (17) the resultative participle and the copula
agree grammatically with the subject of the clause, which refers to the
agent, rather than the object, which refers to the affectee, so only a ver-
bal interpretation is possible. Furthermore, the grammatical agreement
with the subject, which is the agent of the event, forces the participle to
be interpreted with an active rather than passive voice. This active inter-
pretation is further demonstrated by the fact that pronominal objects are
expressed by attaching L-suffixes, which are used elsewhere to express the
pronominal object of active verbs, e.g.   (21) ""aw-náša hóle dwìq6lla} ‘The man has seized her’
        cf. ""aw-náša b-dawêqla} ‘The man will seize her’The behaviour of the resultative participle in the various structural con-
figurations discussed above may be summarized in the table below:                        Function                 Grammatical agreement
Intransitive telic      Verbal/adjectival        Grammatical subject
Intransitive atelic     Verbal                   Grammatical subject
Transitive active       Verbal                   Grammatical subject
Transitive passive      Verbal/adjectival        Grammatical subject
The following historical development of the construction may be hypoth-
esized. The resultative participle was originally an adjectival form qualify-
ing the affectee of an event, denoting the resultant state of the affectee
in a telic intransitive event or a transitive event. When used predicatively
an ambiguity developed between the interpretation of the function of the
construction as the expression of the resultant stative property (adjecti-
                             the syntax of verbs                              659val) or the verbal event that brought about the state (verbal). The verbal
interpretation was extended by analogy to intransitive atelic predicates,
which do not result in any state and could not by themselves provide the
semantic basis required for the formation of the resultative participle. It
was also extended by analogy to transitive active predicates. The feature
of agreement with the grammatical subject was extended by analogy
from the original intransitive/passive construction to the transitive active
construction.
   Regarding the copula component of constructions with the resultative
participle, this can be either the deictic copula or the basic copula. As
has been shown in §15.3.1.–§15.3.2., one of the conditioning factors for
selecting one particular type of copula is the nature of the predicate.
The enclitic basic copula and the deictic copula are used with predicates
expressing either contingent or permanent properties but the independent
basic copula is used only with predicates expressing permanent properties
that, typically, are intrinsic to the nature of the subject referent and have
not been acquired. It follows that it is in principle not appropriate to use
the independent copula with the resultative participle, which, whether
adjectival or verbal, expresses an acquired property of the subject. There
are sporadic exceptions to this principle, such as (22), where the speaker
appears to have used the independent copula in order to present the
property of being betrothed as a permanent property of the woman in
question:  (22) l7ðeti ""àyya} t-íla m6n-hèš t-la-bràya} ""áyya ""íla yíwta qa-dìyi?} bàxtila.}
       ‘Don’t you know that she has been betrothed to me since before
       she was born? She is my wife.’ (A25:39)15.4.1.2. Function in Non-Narrative Discourse
We shall now examine in greater detail the function that these resultative
constructions have when used verbally.
   It is important to make a distinction between its usage in narrative texts
and its usage in non-narrative discourse.
   In non-narrative discourse the resultative form is used to denote the
result of a past verbal event that is in existence in the present. It is gener-
ally appropriate to translate it with the English present perfect. The deictic
copula is used with the participle to draw particular attention to a cur-
rent situation. There is a certain amount of subjectivity in the use of
the deictic copula, but it is generally employed in assertive clauses to
draw attention to a resultant state that has some kind of relevance to the
660                                chapter fifteenimmediate present moment in time, e.g. hole ""6°ya ‘He has come’. In inter-
rogative clauses the enclitic copula is used, e.g. ""6°y5le? ‘Has he come?’ The
construction is negated in both assertions and questions by the negative
copula, e.g. l5le ""6°ya ‘He has not come’, l5le ""6°ya? ‘Has he not come’.
   The expression hole ""6°ya ‘He has come’ denotes that the subject has the
property of ‘having come’, which is the result of a prior event of coming.
It asserts the existence in the present of the result of an event without
referring directly to any specific event that brought about this result.
Therefore, without further specification by a time adverbial in the clause
or by the discourse context, the statement hole ""6°ya denotes that he has the
property of ‘having come’ as a result of some unspecified event of coming
that occurred some time in the past. There is no restriction on when the
event occurred other than that it was some time before the present. The
q†ille form,6 by contrast, refers directly to a specific event in the past and
not to its result. The event has typically occurred in the recent past and
this may extend up to the present moment. The expression dìya °éle} ‘He
has come just now’ would be used to assert the occurrence of a specific
event that has just taken place. Likewise the q†ilwale form °ewale denotes
the occurrence of a specific event in the more remote past.
   It may be the case that the result of the actions of q†ille and q†ilwale
have some kind of relevance in the present. This is especially the case
with regard to q†ille, which, in conversational discourse, is often translated
most appropriately with the English ‘perfect of recent past’.7 Such resul-
tant present relevance is, however, an implicature of their use rather than
a component of their meaning. As remarked, the endpoint of an event
expressed by q†ille may be the present moment. The q†ille form °ele ‘He
has come’ would be used by a speaker when he sees a person walking
through the door of his home and the greeting said to the visitor on his
arrival would be b-šˆna °élux!} ‘You have come in peace!’ The resultative
form refers to a resultant state that holds at a period that is not adjacent
temporally with the endpoint of the event. The resultant state is discon-
nected from the event temporally in that the resultative form is typically
used after some time has elapsed after the event, crucially when none of
the event can be witnessed directly. The resultative form hole ""6°ya ‘He has
come’, for example, would be used when a guest is sitting in the house
   6
     For the sake of conciseness we shall dispense with noting in all cases the fact that the
q6m-qa†6l and q6m-qa†6lwa forms are suppletive variants of transitive perfective q†ille and
q†ilwale forms when pronominal suffixes are added.

be used if any phase of the event of coming can be seen directly by the
speaker, even if this is only the static endpoint of his standing at the door.
One says dìya °éle} ‘He has come just now’ referring explicitly to the fact
that the endpoint of the event coincides with the present moment, but the
expression *diya hole ""6°ya would not be felicitous. The resultative form is
disconnected from the event also referentially in that it does not make any
direct reference to the specific event that caused the result in question.
   The result expressed by the resultative form may be an actual perceptible
situation or an experiential property of the subject referent, e.g.  (1) hón xíla gêrðo.} ‘I have eaten stew.’
  (2) xílli gêrðo.} ‘I have eaten the stew.’Example (1) may be interpreted as asserting that at the present moment
there is a perceptible result of my having eaten stew at some unspecified
time in the past, e.g. I had a large stew for lunch and cannot eat much
dinner. This construction could also be interpreted as asserting that I have
the permanent property of being in the state of having eaten stew, i.e.
it has been part of my life experience. In this interpretation it denotes
that on some occasion, possibly on more than one occasion, I have eaten
stew, though not necessarily recently. The purpose of the deictic copula
in both interpretations would be to draw attention to the relevance of the
past event to the present moment in time. In both cases there is a degree
of indeterminateness concerning the event. The verbal form implies the
existence of at least one unspecified member of the set of past events of
eating. In the first interpretation the implication from the discourse context
in which it is used (e.g. in response to the question ‘Why do you not want
to eat your dinner?’) is that there was only one unspecified event. In the
experiential interpretation the possibility remains open that there were
more than one. In example (2) the q†ille form, by contrast, refers to the
occurrence of one specific event that occurred at a specific point in time
in the recent past. In such a construction the noun g6rðo would, therefore,
normally be definite with a specific identifiable referent.
   The context may force a definite interpretation of an object nominal
of a resultative construction, e.g.","[691, 692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697, 698, 699, 700]"

When the object nominal is definite, the verb normally has a pronominal
object that agrees with it. This applies both to object nominals placed
after the verb and those placed before the verb. Examples from the text

  (20) súse díye mtaslóm6lle †la-xolàma.} ‘He handed over his horse to the
       servant.’ (A12:8)The pronominal agreement with a definite nominal object does not occur
in certain situations, which may be classified as follows.(i) Inalienable Possession
The agreement on the verb is occasionally omitted when the referent of
the object nominal lacks distinctness from the subject referent due to its
being an inalienable appurtenance or possession of the subject, usually a
body part or the reflexive expression gan- ‘self ’, e.g.  (21) šám6† qðále dìye.} ‘Let him break his neck.’ (A15:13)
  (22) si-mxi-""áqlux gu-xáße díye. ‘Go and kick his back.’ (A15:13)

       I obliged to kill myself working to feed her while she slept?’
       (A21:38)This, however, is only a tendency and on several occasions the agreement
pronoun occurs on the verb with such objects, e.g.
                            the syntax of verbs                             775  (25) q6m-p>réla ""ˆne.} ‘He burst his eye’ (A16:2)
  (26) ""o-rább6n mútt6lla ""áqle díye rš-8q6l bàxta.} ‘The monk put his leg onto
       the leg of the woman.’ (A16:11)
  (27) ""u-""áti d6-ráqð6t š5šátla gàn6x.} ‘You should dance and shake yourself.’
       (A27:11)(ii) Objects Lacking Distinctness from the Activity
In some cases the explanation for the lack of agreement with a definite
object nominal is that the nominal does not play a prominent role in the
discourse but rather is presented as an incidental component of the activ-
ity. This applies to constructions such as those in (28)–(30) which have the
word b5°a ‘the house’ as the object complement of the verb:  (28) ""ána mtugbárt6n bˆ°a.} ‘I have looked after the house (I have done
       housekeeping).’ (A21:13)
  (29) ""ána mquzqázt6n bˆ°a.} ‘I have arranged the house (I have done
       housework).’ (A21:15)
  (30) qìmt5la,} mxulálta ""amàne} ""u-kníšta bˆ°a} ""u-mtugbàrta.} ‘She got up and
       washed the dishes, swept the house (did house-sweeping) and tidied
       it.’ (A21:20)(iii) Clauses with Reduced Discourse Prominence
The omission of the agreement pronoun is conditioned in some cases by
the reduced prominence of the clause as a whole due to its occurrrence
in a section of the discourse supplying background material rather than
in the prominent foreground. This applies to (31) and (32), which are
extracts from narratives. In (31) the clauses referring to the cutting of
Zàl’s hair without the object agreement are in a section that gives the
preliminary background to the following foreground narrative section, in
which the clause that recounts one specific event of the cutting of his hair
has object agreement. In (32) the clause without object agreement ‘They
did not know God’ supplies general information about the nature of idol
worshippers, which supplies the background for the following foreground
events. The foreground contains a key clause in direct speech with object
agreement ‘I shall kill my son’:  (31) bábe dìye,} Z?l,} ""í°wale xà-naša} maqrè†wa káwse dìye} [ back-
       ground] y-amríle ˙allàqa.} . . . mattúwa semálta gu-xáße díye ""u-y-asêqwa}

       his hair, called a barber. . . . He would place a ladder on his back
       and climb up the ladder and cut the hair of Zàl. He cut his hair
       and looked at the head of Zàl. (He saw) that there were scars of
       enormous wounds.’ (A29:2–3)

       was. They used to worship idols. (29) His father the king said “I
       shall kill my son”. His son fled.’ (B6:28–29)In some cases of the omission of the object agreeement the clause in
question is of reduced discourse prominence due to the fact that it repeats
information that has been given previously rather than advancing the
discourse, e.g.  (33) qayèmwa báb6t xêtna,} dawèqwala ""íð6 báb6 k yàlo.} ya'ni dwáqa dawèqwa
       ""íð6-dìye} qá-t ""ó-m6ndi wèle.} ‘The father of the groom would rise

       (A14:17)
                            the syntax of verbs                             777In a stretch of foregrounded discourse the end of the section is sometimes
given greater prominence than the body of the section to mark a clear
boundary. This may be reflected in the distribution of object agreement.
In (37), for example, the execution of two brothers is presented in a
discourse section that may be interpreted as expressing a single overall
event. The princess Parizada gives a command for the execution of each
of the brothers. The command for the second execution, which closes the
section, has the agreement but the first command lacks it:  (37) síq5le xóna ""o-gò‰a,} . . . mèra prúmu rèše!} ""áwwa prìm réše.} qím5le
       ""o-trè.} qím5le ""o-trè,} sìq5le} . . . mèra prùmle réše díye!} ""áp-aw réše
       díye prìma.} ‘The oldest brother came up . . . she said “Cut off his
       head!” His head was cut off. The second one got up. The second
       one got up and came up . . . she said “Cut off his head!” Also his
       head was cut off.’ (A24:31)(iv) Pragmatic Relation of the Object to the Rest of the Clause
Another factor relevant to object agreement is the pragmatic relation that
the object has to the other components of the clause. Agreement with a
definite direct object is generally omitted on the verb if the object consti-
tutes a narrow focus which does not include the verb. The focus may be
a new information focus, in which case the verb is in the presupposition
of the clause, or the focus may be one of prominence, in which case the
verb may be new information but is of reduced prominence. In (38), for
example, the clauses marked in bold that have the proper names Zine
and M>mo as direct objects, have the presupposition ‘We shall take X to
Y’, the object slot X, therefore, is a narrow information focus whereas the
verb is in the presupposition:  (38) šuréla mjawóde m-©ðàðe} ""7ni nábl6x k6s-d-ˆni.} Zìne nábl6x k6s-
       M9mo} lo-M9mo nábl6x k6s-Zìne.} mèra là,} bàxta} be-b9x6t-ila.}
       maq6†làle gáw‰a} nabléxi Zìne k6s-M9mo.} ‘They started arguing
       with one another regarding whom to take to whom. “Should we
       take Zine to M>mo or M>mo to Zine?” They said “No, a woman
       is treacherous. She will have her husband killed. Let us take Zine
       to M>mo.” ’ (A26:2)As we have seen in §15.4.1.4.1. and §15.4.2.6.1., when the verb is a
compound form with a copula clitic, the copula element is often moved
leftwards onto the item in narrow focus. When the clitic is attached by
778                            chapter fifteenthis process to a definite nominal object, there is no pronominal agree-
ment on the verb, e.g.","[812, 813, 814, 815, 816, 817]"
"  (16) A: ""7nile ""è°ya qedàmta?} B: ""è°y5le qedámta xòni.} ‘A: “Who has come
       this morning?” B: “My brother has come this morning.” ’
  (17) A: módit xèzya gu-bˆ°a?} B: xèzy5w6n gu-b7°a k°àwux.} ‘A: “What have
       you seen in the house?” B: “I have seen your book in the house.” ’This shows that narrow focus of new information alone does not neces-
sarily bring about a construction with leftward copula movement. Rather
it is used subjectively by the speaker to communicate information that is
not only new but that he wishes to present as worthy of particular atten-
tion. It is more regularly used in contrastive constructions such as (1)–(8),
where the speaker wishes to correct a misapprehension, than in responses
to constituent questions.
    It should also be noted that the leftward copula movement only occurs
when the focus is exhaustive, i.e. when the item in focus is unique for the
role in question. It is not used when the focused item constitutes one of
a list of items that perform the role, e.g.
                             the syntax of verbs                               681  (18) mère yèmmi ""7nile plìxa?} mèra bábi plíx5t ""àti,} ""u-xmára-w tàwra} ""u-""ána
       mtugbárt6n bˆ°a.} ‘He said “Mother, who has worked?” She said
       “My dear, you have worked, (also) the ass and the ox, and I have
       attended to the house.” ’ (A21:13)Observe that in the responses of (16) and (17) the copula that occurs with
the resultative participle is an enclitic rather than a deictic copula. This
reflects a tendency to use the enclitic copula in conversational discourse
when the verbal form is in the presupposition of the clause and is not
asserted. This is typically the case in responses to constituent questions
when the verb is repeated.
   The construction is sometimes used elsewhere in a more subjective
fashion, in places where the speaker wishes to draw particular attention to
an item, due to its unexpectedness or its importance in the context, e.g.  (19) b-àyy6t mšúdr6lli?} ‘Have you sent for me for this reason?’ (A21:35)
  (20) ""abàyele dèrya b-réša.} ‘He put his cloak over her.’ (A26:50)
  (21) ""àm6r} ""áwwa t>r7xu póìl5le.} báb6t bráta màra} m-ˆk5le póíla?} har-gubb?n-ix
       wíð6lle.} ‘He said “This door of yours is crooked.” The father of
       the girl said “How can it be crooked? We made it exactly according
       to a spirit-level.” ’ (A17:20)
  (22) mèra màlka t-áw6t basíma.} ""áwwa náša hàtx5le wáða.} màra} mú t-àw6ð?}
       xa-dúk°6t gèld6t tàwr6n híw6lle báne b7°a.} ‘They said “King, may you
       be well. That man is doing such-and-such (i.e. building the fortress
       of D6md6ma).” He said “What could he do? I have given him the
       space of an ox skin to build a house.” ’ (A11:15)
  (23) Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} yá'ni xá°6t Mir-Zàndin-ile šqíla Qára Tè≥din.}
       ‘Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law, that is Qara Te≥din has married
       the sister of Mir-Zandin.’ (A26:55)
  (24) ""u-suráye lˆla jrá†a} sab-zargùlela lwíše.} ‘The Christians were not slip-
       ping since they were wearing sheepskin shoes.’ (B19:7)
  (25) xòš-zuz6x wíðe.} ‘We have made good money.’ (A14:18)Constructions such as those in (19)–(25) are not making contrastive asser-
tions to correct a misapprehension nor are they responses to an explicit
constituent question. The section of the clause that is not in focus is not
strictly a presupposition, i.e. it is not necessarily assumed to be a proposi-
tion that is active in the mind of the hearer. It is part of the assertion of
the clause but with a lesser degree of prominence than the focused item.
Its lack of communicative pronominence relative to the focused item is a
682                          chapter fifteenproperty that it shares with presuppositional material. The basic function
of the leftward focus movement can, therefore, be identified as a means of
marking an enhancement of prominence on the item in question without
necessarily implying that the remainder of the clause is presuppositional.
In (19)–(22) the motivation for the construction is that the argument in
the clause is deemed by the speaker to be unexpected in the general situ-
ation described. In (23) it draws particular attention to the identity of the
person whom Qara Te≥din married, since this is the crucial point that
defines the term x6tna ‘brother-in-law’. Likewise in (24) the speaker gives
enhanced prominence to the ‘sheepskin shoes’ since these were the crucial
reason why the Christians did not slip and so were the key to their success.
In (25) prominence is given to an evaluative expression ‘good money’ in
order to enhance the degree of evaluation.
   Temporal adverbial expressions may be put into focus with the con-
struction in order to convey immediacy, e.g.  (26) bálki qam-xa-šàb°5le ""è°ya.} ‘He has come perhaps just a week ago.’
       (A8:56)The focusing of a gradable quantifier or intensifier with the leftward
copula movement conveys an enhanced degree, e.g.  (27) ""ána ràb5w6n plíxa gu-k7rma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
       orchard.’
  (28) ""áw hàdele bèrya.} ‘He has just been born.’In constructions such as (27) and (28) the elements that come after the
focus are not necessarily presuppositional, but may be part of the asser-
tion of the clause with a lesser degree of prominence than the focused
item. In such constructions with quantifiers and intensifiers the nuclear
stress is sometimes placed at the end of the intonation group rather than
on the item bearing the copula, e.g.  (29) ""ána ráb5w6n plíxa gu-kˆrma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
       orchard.’
  (30) yóma hádele zrìqa.} ‘The sun has just now risen.’ (A26:37)
  (31) xúwwe ""áx‘ile múdwa rìqa.} ‘The snake just managed to escape.’
       (A1:15)In constructions such as (29)–(31) the material after the item bearing the
copula is part of the assertion. These examples show that the copula and
                            the syntax of verbs                            683the nuclear stress placement may operate independently in the marking
of prominence. The nuclear stress is in the default position at the end of
the intonation group and signals that the predicate as a whole is asserted
new information. The copula is used to give particular prominence to one
item in this assertion. In such constructions the copula marks a weaker
level of prominence than when it is combined with the nuclear stress. The
item with the copula is, nevertheless, given more prominence than when
there is no leftward copula movement at all, as in (32).  (32) ""ána rába plíx5w6n gu-kˆrma.} ‘I have worked very much in the
       orchard.’Conversely the nuclear stress is occasionally moved forward to give par-
ticular prominence within the intonation group without the copula moving
from its default position, e.g.  (33) xzáy6t-6lle ""áwwa qàßra?} kúlle b-qarqupyà°a bèny5le.} ‘Do you see this
       palace? It is all built of skulls.’ (A24:51)(ii) Topically Prominent Constituent
A leftward moving copula may also be attached to a topically prominent
constituent. A constituent with topical prominence has a referent that has
been mentioned in the immediately prior discourse, with the result that
it is not only assumed to be familiar to the hearer but also activated in
his consciousness. It serves as the topic of the clause. Unlike an item in
focus, the topic is not part of the assertion of the clause, rather it is the
remainder of the clause that is asserted and that conveys new information
about this topic.
    Topical items with a leftward moving copula do not bear the nuclear
stress. They are, therefore, given a weaker level of prominence than focused
items that have both the copula and the nuclear stress.
    Not all items that serve as a clause topic have the leftward moving
copula attached to them. This construction is restricted to topics that
the speaker wishes to give particular prominence. One context in which
the construction is attested is where the item has been activated in the
immediately preceding discourse and is repeated in consecutive clauses.
This is the case in (1) and (2), in which the second occurrence of the item
in question has a copula attached to it:  (1)   ""áti rába wíð6t spayù°a} ""u-""átit pqiðêll6n.} ‘You did a lot of good and
        you instructed us.’ (A8:87)
684                               chapter fifteen  (2) mátti táxta hàtxa} ta-t-""àzi,} lí°6n d>ràje,} ta-ßáli gu-gòma.} táxt5la mútte hàtxa}
      ta-ßáli tàma.} ‘They placed a board like this, so that they could go
      (there)—there are no steps—so that they can go down to the base-
      ment. They placed a board like this, so that they could go down
      there.’ (A22:10)These constituents are anaphorically bound to the immediately preced-
ing discourse and function as the informational starting point, i.e. topic,
of the ensuing propositions. These can be regarded as two aspects of a
broader notion of topic as a current item of concern in the discourse. The
constituents would have this status even if they did not have the copula
enclitic. The copula gives added coding, which enhances the prominence
of this status. This ‘heavy’ coding of the clause initial topic is often used
as a strategy to signal a boundary in the discourse. The purpose of sig-
nalling the boundary may be to mark the clause off distinctly from what
precedes in order to give prominence to the content of the clause, which
appears to be the motivation in (1) and (2). In (3) the strategy of bound-
ary marking is used to mark a clear opposition between the actions of
the subject referents in two adjacent clauses:  (3) mbàdla,} qyàm5la,} kúlla b8yi t-àzi,} ""áww5le dmìxa Barzèkko.} ‘In the
      morning they got up and all wanted to go, but he, Barz6kko, was
      asleep.’ (A12:8)The construction may also be used to give topical prominence to the
anaphoric element hatxa ‘thus’, which refers back to a situation in the
preceding discourse. In (4) the purpose is to set the two clauses apart and
present them as expressing separate events:  (4) hátx6n wíða be-xàli,} hátx6n wíða be-""àmti} ‘I did such-and-such in the
      house of my uncle, I did such-and-such in the house of my aunt.’
      (A23:40)(iii) Other cases of leftward movement
It is necessary to distinguish some other categories of construction which
exhibit leftward movement of the copula enclitic. These include interroga-
tive constituents, adverbials and certain subordinating particles.(a) Interrogative constituents
The copula element of the resultative is generally attached to inter-
rogative constituents. In some cases the interrogative constituent bears
                           the syntax of verbs                          685the nuclear stress and it can be classified as the expression of a type of
narrow focus. The remainder of the clause is presuppositional and the
focus is put on the interrogative item. Unlike assertive clauses, however,
the identity of the interrogative item is not being asserted but rather
questioned. Examples:  (1)   ""ˆnile plíxa ""èdyo?} ‘Who has worked today?’ (A21:15)
  (2)   ""ˆnile q†íl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A28:7)
  (3)   mòdit wíða?} ‘What have you done?’ (A23:34)
  (4)   yóm6 tré ""ˆk5tu dmíxe?} ‘Where did you sleep on the second day?’
        (A12:19)
  (5)   m-ˆk6t ""è°ya láxxa} ""u-dàx-it ""è°ya?} ‘From where have you come here
        and how have you come?’ (A14:33)
  (6)   dàx-it xíla kúlla?!} ‘How have you eaten all of it?!’ (A2:11)Such constructions are analogous to interrogative clauses such as (7) and
(8) in which the question concerns one constituent:  (7)   ""àtit q†íl6lle xúwwe?} ‘Was it you who killed the snake?’ (A24:45)
  (8)   ""àtit mú°y6lle †7ri?} ‘Was it you who brought back my bird?’ (A24:32)In many cases, however, the nuclear stress is placed on the final word of
the intonation group rather than on the interrogative constituent, e.g.  (9) ""7nile plìxa?} ‘Who has worked?’ (A21:13)
  (10) ""7nile q†ìl6lle?} ‘Who has killed him?’ (A15:16)
  (11) m8nile mèßya z6dy6lléy laxxàne?} ‘Who could have thrown them here?’
       (A8:15)
  (12) módit xèzya qam-ˆnux?} módit xêzya?} ‘What have you seen before your
       eyes? What have you seen?’ (A24:31)
  (13) módin xèzya b-xêlmi?} ‘What have I seen in my dream?’ (A1:14)
  (14) ""7ni báxt5la mubrˆ°a?} ‘Which woman has given birth?’ (A25:6)
  (15) †la-módit ""è°ya dmìxa} gu-šwì°i?} ‘Why have you come to sleep in my
       bed?’ (A26:3)
  (16) ""u-lé-y-y>ð6n m-7k6t ""ê°ya.} ‘And I do not know from where you have
       come.’ (A14:76)
  (17) y8ð6t ""7k6n dêry6lle?} ‘Do you know where I have put him?’ (A22:44)Such constructions, in which the nuclear stress is not on the interrogative
constituent, have a different information structure, in that the question
686                           chapter fifteenis not focused exclusively on the interrogative constituent but rather on
the proposition as a whole. The attachment of the copula enclitic to the
interrogative constituent, therefore, cannot be motivated by its being in
narrow focus. The interrogative constituent, nevertheless, is what the
question primarily requests information about and so is given prominence
by the copula, but this is a weaker level of relative prominence than
constructions in which the constituent is marked both by the copula and
by the nuclear stress.(b) Adverbials
Narrow focus is sometimes given to an anaphoric adverbial by attach-
ing the copula to it and giving it the nuclear stress. As in some of the
examples of narrow focus on nominals cited above, the remainder of the
clause is not always necessarily a presupposition. The purpose of giving
the adverbial a high degree of prominence is to enhance its anaphoric
function and bind it closely with what precedes, e.g.  (1) mutt7°6lle púmma gu-pùmm6t} Fàrxo,} šuréla myàßa} ""ˆ-dan5la kèlye.} ‘She
      put her mouth on the mouth of Farxo and began sucking. At that
      time they stopped (crying).’ (A25:5)
  (2) †alána yá'ni †alàna,} sab-šèmša ""7-g6t maxyàwa} †uráne ""àtx5na wíye.} ‘(The
      word) †alana means “shady”, since when the sun rose, the mountains
      became like that (i.e. became shady).’ (B3:2)
  (3) bábi muttúle táma bˆ°a.} zìll5ni,} t6xrú°a dìyi} ""u-t-xóni d-o-gò‰a.} ""áwwa
      xóni tàm5le bèrya.} ‘My father set up home there. We went, as far as
      I remember, together with my older brother. This brother of mine
      was born there’. (B8:10)In (4) this device of enhancing the force of the anaphoric binding of the
adverbial is used in a clause that has the status of a relative clause. The
effect is to bind the clause clearly to the preceding head noun:  (4) ""5-dúk°6t m>m6ðìwal6n,} ""ax-xa-bányo zòra,} ""átxa gu-""úpra nqìra,} kúll6n
      tàm5w6x m5mèðe t-íw6x bèrye}—""áw6n pìš5wa.} ‘The place in which they
      used to baptize us, like a small bath, dug into the earth, where all
      of us who were born were baptized—that has survived.’ (B3:20)An adverbial that does not bear the nuclear stress may have the copula
attached to it, as in (5), where the copula is moved leftwards onto the tem-
                            the syntax of verbs                              687poral adverbial in the clause ""7-g5la ˙5dúde mùrme}. This may be regarded as
a type of topical prominence, which is a weaker level of prominence than
the prominence expressed by both the copula and the nuclear stress. The
effect, as is generally the case with clauses with initial topically prominent
items, is to signal a boundary in the discourse. Although the initial item
is anaphorically bound to what precedes, its status as a communicative
starting point is enhanced. This is the case here, in which the clause in
question offers a piece of incidental information about the general histori-
cal situation, which is not directly connected to the event of the wedding
discussed in what precedes. This should be contrasted with the function
of the construction occurring earlier in the passage ""ˆ-ga-wewa gwíra xóni
Šèmmo}, in which the adverbial is given a stronger degree of prominence by
both copula movement (in this case a past copula) and by nuclear stress.
The speaker intends this clause to be bound closely with what precedes,
since it relates directly to the wedding.  (5) taxránne †la-xlúl6t xóni Šêmmo} ""7-g6 t-w7wa ríqe nàše} ßèlye Bad5rêške,}
      ""áskar t-léwi síqta gu-""Ón-Nùne,} ""ˆ-ga-wewa gwíra xóni Šèmmo.} ""6ngl6znàye}
      ""áskar-t léwi tàxr6n.} ""7-g5la ˙5dúde mùrme,} gu-Tùrki músqe.} ‘I remember
      the wedding of my brother Š6mmo, when people had fled and
      come down to Bad5r6ške. The Levy army went up to ""“n-Nune. It
      was then that Š6mmo married. I remember the English, the Levy
      army. At that time the borders were moved, they were moved up
      to Turkey.’ (B9:21)A similar strategy is exhibited by (6)–(8). Here the adverbs with an enclitic
copula but without the nuclear stress are linked correlatively to the fol-
lowing clause rather than being bound to what precedes. In (6) the fol-
lowing clause specifies the content of the adverb. Examples (7) and (8)
are adversative constructions. The initial adverbials set up an expectation
that is reversed in the second clause:  (6) bróni hátx5la qa∂ìya} málka hóle mú°y6lla bráte dìye.} ‘My son, the situa-
      tion is like this. The king has brought his daughter.’ (A21:8)
  (7) zíl5le †8ya bràtux.} hád6x-ile wìða,} bás lˆle xèzy6lla.} ‘He went to look
      for your daughter. He acted thus, but did not find her.’
  (8) k6má-gay6x tíwe m-©ðàðe,} har-lán mêßya ""axwá°e dìye.} ‘However many
      times we have sat together, I still cannot be like him.’ (A25:44)
688                            chapter fifteen(c) Subordinating Conjunctions
In subordinate clauses opening with the general subordinating conjuction
D or the conditional particle ""6n the copula is attached to the conjunction
at the front of the clause.
   The subordinating conjunction D may serve as the head of a relative
clause (1–3) or the subordinative operator of other types of clause, e.g.  (1)   mqawòl5w6n,} ""ap-""an-zúze kúlla t-in šqìl6lla} p>lènna pàlge.} ‘I promise,
        I’ll divide into halves also all the money that I took.’ (A1:17)
  (2)   la-b8y6n ""áyya bráta t-in-mú°y6lla t-y8ða qá-t †líba díya hóle mì°a.} ‘I do
        not want this girl whom I have brought to know that her betrothed
        has died.’ (A4:33)
  (3)   t-lá mar>wà°5le ""o-márga} t-it-súsux dèry6lle tàma?} ‘Is the meadow in
        which you have put your horse without owners?’ (A25:60)
  (4)   ""áx-t-it-""áti šêtya,} ""áp-""aw hàd6x.} ‘As you have drunk, he also (has
        been treated) in the same way.’ (A26:33)
  (5)   dáx t-in-mu°7°6lla ""a-béna xèta,} ""ay-béna ""àna ma°yánna.} ‘Just as I
        brought her before, so this time I shall bring her.’ (A27:30)
  (6)   ""ím6 t-íla mú°y6lla ""a-bráta ""èlle dìye,} mbùrx6lla.} ‘When they brought
        that girl to him, they wedded her (to him).’ (A16:6)
  (7)   xá-xeta qímela zìlela,} ha-t-íla zíle óêmy5le.} ‘They went (to help) once
        again, but by the time they had gone, it was put out.’ (A48:4)
  (8)   l5t-xzáya bíye díye t-íle mì°a?} ‘Don’t you see that he is dead?’
        (A17:2)On many occasions the copula bears the nuclear stress of the intonation
group, e.g.  (9)  ""u-dí‰5le ßèly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na,} ""5-""7na t-ìle ""è°ya qamáye réša.} ‘He went
       back down to the spring, the spring to which he had come previ-
       ously.’ (A26:32)
  (10) ""ó-yòm t-ìle plí†a} bróne díye mì°5le.} ‘The day that he went out, his
       son died.’ (A4:32)
  (11) ""ánna dax-t-ìla zíle,} M8mo dèry6lle gu-z6ndàna.} ‘When they had gone,
       they put M>mo in jail.’ (A26:74)
  (12) ""ax-t-ìle wíra,} ""í°wa dúk°a ta-t-kalèwa.} ‘When he entered, there was
       space for him to stand.’ (A22:30)The placement of the copula on the subordinate particle in relative clauses
can be related to the use of leftward copula movement to mark topically
                              the syntax of verbs                               689prominent items. The referent represented by the D particle, which is that
of the antecedent noun in the adjacent main clause, is clearly the main
topical concern of the relative clause. Although such copula movement
to mark topical prominence is an optional strategy in main clauses, it has
been formalized as a fixed rule in subordinate relative clauses. It would
appear that this was further generalized to other types of subordinate
clause opening with the particle D.
   Examples of leftward movement of the copula in protasis clauses open-
ing with ""6n:  (13) ""èn-in ""àna ""è°ya gu-šwí°6x,} qr7g6n xaddàm6x.} ‘If I have come to sleep
       in you bed, call your servants.’ (A26:4)
  (14) ""6n-it ""è°ya šúl6t qa˙bù°a,} k6s-báb6n B9ku.} ‘If you have come to for-
       nicate, then (lodge) with our father B>ku.’ (A26:26)The movement of the copula onto the conditional particle ""6n is likely to
have arisen from the fact that the particle was originally followed by D,
as is still the case in some NENA dialects.","[719, 720, 721, 722, 723, 724, 725, 726, 727, 728]"

      The main source for the Kurdish material presented here is the description of the
Kurdish dialects of north-western Iraq in MacKenzie (1961). I have adopted his transcrip-
tion rather than convert it into the conventional orthography of written Kurdish.
20                             introduction     Kurdish                      C. Barwar

     p-hawas ‘happy’              b-xamme ‘worried’(v) In both the C. Barwar and Kurdish dialects the copula verb ‘to be’ is
    expressed by an enclitic that is inflected for person and number like
    a verb. Although there are signs of the emergence of such a clitic in
    earlier Eastern Aramaic, its full development and acquisition of verbal
    inflection are apparently due to the influence of Kurdish:
     Kurdish       C. Barwar
     aw kurd-a ""aw qurðay5le (< qurðaya-ile)        ‘He is Kurdish’
     tô kurd-ì     ""ati qurðay5w6t (< qurðaya-iw6t) ‘You (ms.) are Kurdish’Kurdish inflectional morphological material is occasionally incorporated
into Aramaic words. This is the case, for example, with hypocoristic voca-
tive forms of names. In the C. Barwar dialect these take the endings -o and
-e, the latter being characteristic of female names (§20.2.22.), which are
the Kurdish inflectional endings of vocatives (MacKenzie 1961: 156).
   In some cases there is a convergence of the phonetic form of an item
in the NENA dialect with a corresponding item in Kurdish without there
necessarily being a borrowing of morphological material. Such phonetic
convergence is found, for example, in the demonstrative pronouns. In
C. Barwar there are three categories of demonstrative, viz. near to speaker,
in the distance, and absent. The Kurdish dialects of the region not only
have the same tripartite demonstrative system but also have demonstrative
pronouns of a strikingly similar form. Those from among the sets listed
by MacKenzie (1961: 174) that are of the greatest similarity are shown in
the following table. Despite this resemblance, the pronouns in C. Barwar
can be explained as having an internal Aramaic etymology (§7.4.):     C. Barwar                                    Kurdish
     ""awwa             ‘this (ms.)’               awa
     "">waha            ‘that (ms.) over there’    awèhè
     ""aw               ‘that (absent)’            awThe verbal system of C. Barwar and the NENA dialects in general has
undergone fundamental changes from what is found in the earlier liter-
ary forms of Aramaic. The two finite verbal forms of earlier Aramaic,
known as the suffix conjugation (q†al) and the prefix conjugation ( yiq†ol,
                               introduction                               21liq†ol, niq†ol ) have been completely replaced by participles, which have
acquired verbal properties and verbal inflection. Broadly speaking, the
erstwhile active participle serves as the base for verbal forms expressing
present and future tenses or the past tense with an imperfective aspect
whereas the erstwhile passive participle serves as the base of past tenses
with a perfective aspect.
   Several features of the verbal system that is found in C. Barwar have
parallels with Kurdish and must be considered to be contact induced.
These include the ergative type of construction of the perfective past verbal
base q†il-, whereby past actions are expressed by a passive construction
with the patient being presented as the grammatical subject rather than
by an active construction with the agent as the grammatical subject (§8.3.),
e.g. baxta q†ila-le ‘He killed the woman’ (literally ‘The woman was killed
by him’). This type of ergative construction with perfective past verbs,
which is common to the whole NENA group, has parallels in Kurdish
(MacKenzie 1961: 193–194). Another innovation of C. Barwar, which is
found only in a subgroup of NENA, is the use of a compound construc-
tion consisting of the combination of an originally passive participle q†ila
(referred to in this grammar as the resultative participle) and the verb ‘to
be’ to express the perfect (§15.4.1.). Again, this appears to have arisen by
influence from Kurdish, which has a parallel type of compound construc-
tion (MacKenzie 1961: 187–189).
   It is important to observe, however, that there are some differences
between the C. Barwar dialect and the local Kurdish dialects in these
two verbal forms. In Kurdish the ergative type construction of the past
perfective with the patient of the action being the grammatical subject
and the agent expressed by an oblique agentive phrase (‘by X’) is naturally
restricted to transitive verbs. In the C. Barwar dialect and most other
NENA dialects, however, the ergative type of inflection with an agen-
tive phrase (‘by X’) expressed by the preposition l- has been extended
by analogy to intransitive verbs, e.g. qim-le ‘He has risen’. This has not
happened in Kurdish or any other Iranian language in the NENA area.
In fact, in some Iranian languages the precise opposite has happened,
namely the active intransitive construction with the verb agreeing with
the grammatical subject has been extended by analogy to the transitive
past conjugation. This is the case, for example, in Modern Persian. The
extension of the ergative inflection to intransitives seems, rather, to be a
development internal to NENA. Vestiges of the original system in which
the ergative inflection is restricted to transitive verbs has survived in a
22                                 introductionfew Jewish dialects on the eastern periphery of the NENA area (e.g.
J. Sulemaniyya, J. Kerend and J. Sanandaj).32
   Another difference between C. Barwar and Kurdish is the fact that in
C. Barwar the compound perfect construction is not ergative. The gram-
matical subject of transitive verbs is the agent rather than the patient. In
Kurdish, on the other hand, the corresponding compound construction,
which appears to have been the model for the NENA construction, is
ergative in form when the verb is transitive. The loss of the ergative inflec-
tion in C. Barwar and most other NENA dialects is again a development
internal to NENA. The original ergative type of construction has survived
only in a few Jewish dialects on the eastern periphery.33
   These developments suggest that the influence from Iranian on the
Aramaic verbal system must have had a considerable time depth. In fact,
traces of ergative inflection of past tense verbs is found in Aramaic as early
as the 5th century B.C. and also in the main literary languages, Syriac,
Babylonian Talmudic Aramaic and Mandaic, in the first millennium A.D.
This must have arisen by contact with earlier forms of Iranian, such as
Old Persian and Middle Persian, where ergative constructions are found.
It is significant that in Classical Syriac texts a number of cases are found
where the ergative inflection is used with intransitive verbs, e.g. qìm l-eh
(Nöldeke 1904, §279). This is presumably the result of interference from
the vernacular and shows that the analogical extension of the ergative
inflection to past intransitives had taken place many centuries ago in the
vernacular.34
   The influence of Arabic on the C. Barwar dialect is largely restricted to
the lexicon (§20.1.2.2.) and has not had a discernible effect on the phono-
logical and grammatical structure. In the twentieth century the speakers of
C. Barwar were immersed in an Arabic speaking environment, both due
to their residence in the Iraqi towns and also due to the use of Arabic in
schools. The fact, however, that Arabic influence has not penetrated the
grammatical structure of the dialect in the same way as Kurdish and its
Iranian predecessors suggests that this intensive contact with Arabic is a
relatively recent phenomenon. Indeed many of the Arabic loanwords that
are established in the lexicon entered the dialect through Kurdish rather
coming directly from contact with Arabic (§10.11., §20.1.2.2.).","[58, 59, 60, 61]"
"  (4) K8rìm zìlle bar-xmáre díye} †la-m5°éwa xmáre dìye.} ‘Karim went after his
      donkey, in order to fetch his donkey.’ (A14:17)In (5), where the purposive particle is placed before a conditional sentence,
the subordinator D, which belongs with the ta-, occurs both before the
whole sentence and also before the main clause:  (5) bnáya gúda ""u-dráya r>ß?ß,} tá-t ""áp-""6n maxíle màdfa'} t-là-tal6xwa gúda.} ‘He
      built the wall and put lead into it, so that, even if it was hit by artil-
      lery, it would not be destroyed.’ (A11:13)On some occasions a ta-clause denotes the final outcome or result of a
preceding action, whereby the speaker presents the chain of events from
the viewpoint of this outcome, e.g.  (6) qa-mòt hátxa wáða bíyi,} m5°óye dwáq6lla ""ùrxi} ta-t-lá-mß6n ßál6n be-xàli.}

It is sometimes appropriate to translate †la-/ta- ‘until’, in which case the
realis ""i-qa†6l(wa) form may be used in habitual contexts, e.g.  (1) xall•xwa ""amáne bíye ""u-hênna} ta-t-y-awéwa ßàwma.} ‘We would wash ves-

      not until I make a lid also for your head, then you come out.” ’
      (A20:3)19.3.10.3. Direct Complement
A content clause introduced by †la-/ta- sometimes functions as a factive
object complement of verbs such as ‘to say’, ‘to know’, ‘to inform’. This
is related to its use as an object marker of object nominals (§16.3.4.).  (1) ""•°y6x ta-t-m5ðêxl5xu} ta-t-m-díya ""arpà-sa""6te} g8r6g kúlla náš6t má°a pàl†i

Clauses introduced by this particle generally are deontic in modality and
express purpose, e.g.  (1) xán‘i t-amr•nna qalùlta} qa-t-pàrqa.} ‘I’ll tell it to you quite quickly so
      that it will finish.’ (A4:5)
  (2) ßráx5le qa-t-š9ma} brát6t màlka.} ‘He is shouting so that the daughter

      he had struck again—he was the brother of Leli°a—he would heal

  (5) qímle b-zdáya m-bróne dìye} qa-t-là-""am6r.} ‘He was afraid of his son and
      (as a result) did not tell (= He was afraid to tell his son).’ (A8:17)In (6) the verb of such a result clause is in the realis ""i-qa†6l form:  (6) xzóli xa-darmána qa-""ˆni,} qa-t-y-ámß6n xáz6n b6‰-našú°a m•ndi hàle.} ‘Find
      a remedy for my eyes, so that (as a result) I can see people and the

                    syntactic subordination of clauses                            997In (7) it is used as a complement of an expression of ‘keeping vigil’:  (7) šahárta qa-t-qyàmta pál†a.} ‘(They keep) vigil for/until the resurrection
      comes out.’ (B5:54)19.3.11.2. Direct Complement
A content clause introduced by qa- sometimes functions as a factive object
complement. Note that in (1) the copula is placed on the initial pronoun
on account of its focal prominence rather than on the subordinating
particle D:  (1) bár t-ila-ðíta qa-t-""àyy5la °í°a k6sle-dìye,} mux•bla ©ðàðe.} ‘After she realized
      that she had come to him, they fell in love with each other.’ (A4:4)

      not want this girl whom I have brought to know that her betrothed

  (3) dwáqa daw•qwa ""íð6-dìye} qá-t ""ó-m6ndi wèle.} ‘He would shake his hand
      (to confirm) that this has taken place.’ (B5:10)Such a clause may be the complement of an existential particle in con-
structions such as (4):  (4) lí°wa qá-t mbaqríwa bràta.} ‘It was not the practice to ask the girl.’ (B5:2)In (5) the main verb takes a 3fs. pronominal suffix, which can be regarded
as a type of anticipatory raising, in that it refers to the propositional con-
tent of the embedded clause:  (5) ""áwwa maxzóy6lla qá-t ˙>wáli ""álpa-w ""arbà-mma} šênne} t-íle píša bênya.}
      ‘This shows that it was built about one thousand four hundred years
      ago.’ (B1:7)Such object complement clauses may also have deontic force, e.g.  (6) múr †la-xòn6x} qa-t ""êdyo} ""áwði tàgbir} ""ásqi l-ßˆda.} ‘Tell your brother that
      today they should make a plan to go out hunting.’ (A26:43)
  (7) b-xáðexi qá-t mxa°6x°•xxa x6zmayù°a.} ‘We would be very happy to
      renew the family relationship.’ (B5:4)The particle is also used to introduce a clause that is the direct comple-
ment of other expressions, e.g.
998                           chapter nineteen  (8) rába ""5bˆle-lli qa-t kúlla ""anna-jwánqe xéne šoqánna kèpa.} ‘It would be a
      great shame for me to leave all these other young men stone.’ (A8:81)
  (9) ""6n-""áti mwáfq6t qa-t-goránne Gozàli,} brónux b-tàr6ß.} ‘If you agree for me
      to marry Gozali, your son will be cured.’ (A8:95)19.3.12. m6n
On some rare occasions the preposition m6n governs a content clause
rather than a nominal. This is attested where the preposition has a
causal sense (§16.5.4.). The embedded clause is not introduced by the
subordinator D:  (1) ""áyya têk°a . . . t-xaddám°a n‘ìlle} m6n-q6m-xazyále šapìra.} ‘The waist cord
      of the maid-servant snapped, because she saw that he was hand-
      some.’ (A25:56)19.3.13. xa†6r
Causal subordinate clauses are occasionally formed by the particle xa†6r
followed by the subordinator D, e.g.  (1) †¬á-bnone xilìli,} báxta xilàli,} xá†6r t-ínwa mkonêdr6lla.} ‘I have eaten the
      three children, I have eaten the wife, because I rolled her (down the
      hill).’ (A20:12)19.3.14. ka-
There are some marginal attestations in the text corpus of subordinate
clauses introduced by the particle ka- ‘while, when’, which appears to be
related to earlier Aramaic ka≈. It is found at the head of reduced predica-
tions from which a copula element has been omitted. In some cases it is
combined with the D subordinator, in the form ka-t (1–2), in other cases
the D is not used (3):  (1) dàx ""áyya bráta wiðálux brát6t b7°a} ""u-palàxta-w} mbašòle} ""u-xyàpa-w}

      to know what (kind of person) this man is, how could he have made

  (3) mbúrx6ll6n l-©ðàðe} ka-xóna ""u-xà°a,} lá ka-gáw‰a-w bàxta .} ‘They have
      wed us together while (we are) brother and sister, and not while (we
      are) husband and wife.’ (A16:8)19.3.15. Adverbial Content Clauses with No Introductory Particle
Subordinated content clauses with a temporal adverbial function are
occasionally used without an introductory particle. This is attested in (1)
in the second of two ""iman (‘when’)–clauses, where the omission of the
particle may be explained as having arisen by gapping:  (1) mandrìle gáre} qa-t-qàwe} qa-t-""íma t-á°ya ""6ryàna-w} t-á°e tàlga} qa-t-lá-ßala
      dalòpe.} ‘They roll the roof so that it becomes tough, so that when the
      rain comes and the snow comes, leaking water does not seep down
      (into the house).’ (B5:194)In some cases, however, the omission of the ""iman particle is not condi-
tioned by gapping. This is attested both in clauses that provide temporal
background either to what follows (2) or to what precedes (3):  (2) ""u-t-a°éwa sêtwa,} zón6xwa ""êrwe,} xámša réše ""êrwe,} hênna.} ""•rwe zonêxwala}
      ""u-p5rmêxwa.} ‘When winter came, we bought sheep, five head of
      sheep or so. We would buy sheep and slaughter them.’ (B16:27)
  (3) ""6n-wéla biš-p°ì°a,} y-ámr6xxa dàrpa,} yá'ni ßàlya,} t-á°e sêtwa} t-á°ya tàlga
      m•ndi.} ‘If it (the space between the beams) were to become wider,
      (the roof ) would collapse, as we say, that is it would come down,
      when it was winter and the snow arrived.’ (B5:189)This lack of relational particles in temporal adverbial clauses can be
compared to the frequent omission of prepositions before nominals in
temporal adverbial phrases (§14.13.).
1000                         chapter nineteen19.3.16. Content Clauses Complements of Single Constituents
In some cases a content clause introduced by the subordinator D is the
complement of an operator phrase or pronominal element that stands
alone and functions as a main clause predication. This applies to construc-
tions such as the following:  (1) jur•bli ""àna} qa-t-""ána xaz•nwa hàwn6x dáx-wewa} là t-la-b>y•nwal6x.} ‘I
      tested you to see how clever you are. It was not that I did not love
      you.’ (A40:16)
  (2) ""o-t-là pál6x} na-múmk6n t-áx6l gu-bˆ°i.} ‘Whoever does not work, (it is)
      impossible for him to eat in my house.’ (A21:40)
  (3) ""áy t-ix-""•°ye k‘ìxe} hád6x qam-""ˆn6x muby•nna.} ‘It is because we were
      tired that it appeared like that to your eyes’. (A4:36)The initial constituent may be interpreted as a reduced predication: ‘(It
is) not . . .’, ‘(It is) impossible’, ‘(It is) this . . .’
                        19.4. Cleft ConstructionsA cleft construction involves the splitting of a simple clause into two
components that are linked in a predicative relationship, with part of
the contents embedded in a subordinate clause. In English this syntactic
restructuring is often used to express narrow focus on one constituent, e.g.
I want food > What I want is food ~ It is food that I want. In the C. Barwar
dialect cleft constructions are generally not used to express focus on a
constituent in this way. Rather narrow focus is usually conveyed by the
movement of the nuclear stress and/or the copula without the embedding
of the non-focal material in a subordinate clause (see §15.4.1.4.1. i), e.g.  (1) brònux-ile xíla xabúša.} ‘Your son has eaten an apple (= It is your son who
      has eaten an apple).’
  (2) brònux xílle xabúša.} ‘Your son has (just) eaten an apple (= It is your son
      who has ( just) eaten an apple).’Sporadically, however, a fully cleft construction is used with the non-focal
material embedded under the subordinator D, e.g.
                     syntactic subordination of clauses                            1001  (3) t-á°ya t-óya ""áxxa kêsl6x} . . . ta-t-lá-palx6t ""àti} ""ày-ila t-pálxa.} ‘She will
      come and be with you here . . . so that you will not work. It is she who
      will work’ (A34:26)A number of other cleft type constructions can be identified in the text
corpus. The majority of these lack an explicit copula element that links
the embedded clause to the other constituent or contain a copula but no
explicit subordinating particle introducing the embedded clause. They
are, therefore, better termed quasi-cleft constructions.
  One form of quasi cleft structure is illustrated in (4) and (5)  (4) ""í°wa skìnta m•nne} ""o-n9ra m•nne díye.} ""a-skínta t-wéwa gráða dúša bìya,}
      xpírre, xpírre, xpìrre.} ‘He had a knife with him, (and had also) the axe.
      He scraped the honey with the knife (literally: The knife [is that]
      which he scraped honey with), digging, digging and digging.’ (A14:25)
  (5) ""áp-""aw qyàm5le} táwa xáß6t súse dìye-w} ßlàya.} ßlàya,} ßlàya} ""ax-t-íle pqìð6lle.}
      ""áwwa t-wéwa ßláya l-márz6t xa-yàma,} ""ax-t-íle pqìð6lle.} ‘He sat on his
      horse and went down. He went down a long way, as he had instructed
      him. He went down to the shore of the sea (literally: He [is the one]
      who was going down to the shore of the sea), as he had instructed
      him.’ (A12:30)In constructions such as these the cleaving of the clause does not have
the function of putting narrow information focus on the initial constitu-
ent. Rather the initial constituent has topical status, in that it has been
mentioned in the immediately preceding discourse, and the new informa-
tion is expressed in the predicate. This may be compared to constructions
in which a copula is attached to an initial element to express its topical
prominence (§15.4.1.4.1. ii), as in the second clause in (6):  (6) ""áti rába wíð6t spayù°a} ""u-""átit pqiðêll6n.} ‘You did a lot of good and you
      instructed us.’ (A8:87)The purpose of the shift in the copula onto topical prominent items
in constructions such as (6) is to enhance their topical prominence as a
strategy to signal a boundary in the discourse. The occurrence of a topi-
cal constituent in initial position by its nature typically marks a discourse
boundary and the enhancement of this topical status marks the clause off
more distinctly from what precedes. One motivation for this distinctness
is to give prominence to the content of the clause. This is the case in (6)
1002                               chapter nineteenand it appears also to be the motivation in the quasi cleft constructions
(4) and (5), in that these are presented as pivotal or climactic events. In (4)
the act of scraping with the knife leads to the escape of the protagonist
from his imprisonment. The clause in (5) marks the endpoint of a long
journey. The quasi-cleft construction (4) and (5) resemble the copula shift-
ing constructions also structurally and prosodically. The only difference is
the presence of the D particle in (4) and (5) and its absence in (6).
   A further example of this type of quasi-cleft construction is (7). Here the
clause following it has a topical subject with a copula attached to it (ho-nášela
""ê°ye}). Both of the constructions mark off distinct sections of discourse.
In this case the motivation appears to be to present the two activities as
taking place in parallel rather than being linked in a sequence.3   (7) ""o-p6lxána t-íle plìx6lle} ho-nášela ""ê°ye} k•sle dìye} ""u-qímela sìqe.} ‘He did the
       work (literally: The work [is that] which he did). People came to him
       and went away.’ (A16:5)A quasi cleft construction with a topical subject can also be identified in
(8), in which the subject is an asyndetic nominal relative. The fact that
the phrase t-w7wa ràbe ‘those who were many’ lacks a demostrative head
indicates that it should be construed as predicative. The discourse bound-
ary marking function of the construction here is used to signal the onset
of elaborative, background material:   (8) x7†6xwa m6stíke ""àxni,} b-ìð6n x5†•xwa.} b-mašìna x5†•xwa.} ""ítwala mašína
       t-w7wa ràbe.} ‘We used to sew mosquito nets. We sewed them by
       hand. We sewed them by machine. (The ones who) had a machine
       (were those families) that were large.’ (B10:59)In (9) and (10) the quasi-cleft construction has the pronominal adverbi-
als hatxa and had6x in the initial topically prominent position. The main
purpose of the construction in these cases is to give prominence to the
clause as a whole:
   3
     A further conditioning factor for the types of cleft constructions illustrated in (4), (5)
and (7) may have been the use in Kurdish of quasi cleft constructions with the so-called
‘deictic izafe’ to express the present progressive and the perfect (MacKenzie 1961: 205,
210–211).
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                      1003  (9)  l7ka hátxa t-it-mxùmla-w} ‘Where (are you going) while so festively
       dressed? (literally: [ It is] so much that you are festively dressed).’’
       (A35:5)
  (10) hád6x t-ítwa m‘okêbna t•mm6l.} ‘You were so well decked out yester-
       day (literally: [ It is] so much that you are decked out yesterday).’
       (A35:18)Quasi-cleft constructions can be identified also in cases where a content
clause introduced by the subordinator D is the complement of an opera-
tor phrase that stands alone and functions as a main clause predication.
This applies to constructions such as follows:  (11) dàx t-ile-dùs?} ‘How is it that he is right?’ (A17:8)
  (12) xáz6x mà†o-t-itwa wíra.} ‘Let us see how it is that you entered.’ (A47:4)
  (13) bálki t-íla mì°ta,} bálki t-íle xa-m•ndi °í°a bìya.} ‘Perhaps she is dead
       (literally: Perhaps [it is] that she is dead). Perhaps something has
       happened to her.’ (A21:25)
  (14) ""ána k6mà dána t-in-mßalóye †la-márya ""álaha} ta-t-yaw•lli ""êmma dáwe.} ‘I
       was praying to the Lord God so many times to give me a hundred
       gold coins (literally: [ It is] so many times that . . .]).’ (A6:10)These can be analysed as quasi-cleft constructions in that the initial con-
stituent could be regarded as having the status of a reduced predicate,
without a copula element, with the content clause as a constituent.
   A further example of a quasi-cleft with a reduced predicate taking a
content clause as a constituent is (15), in which a temporal adverbial is
in focus:  (15) ""áwwa maxzóy6lla qá-t ˙>wáli ""álpa-w ""arbà-mma} šênne} t-íle píša bênya.}
       ‘This shows that (it was) about one thousand four hundred years
       ago that it was built.’ (B1:7)In (16) an initial temporal adverbial is linked to the rest of the clause by a
copula, though there is no explicit embedding of the subsequent material
under a subordinate particle:  (16) m6n-yárx6t †¬à} ""íle náše mšˆri} plàxa.} ‘From the third month it is that
       people begin to work.’ (B5:107)
1004                           chapter nineteenThe function of the construction is not to put narrow focus on the adver-
bial, since the verbal predicate is equally informative. Rather the purpose
is to enhance the topical prominence of the adverbial, giving it ballast to
mark a boundary of a discourse section. A similar interpretation can be
applied to (17), in which the initial relative phrase has a cleft structure
without a subordinate particle:  (17) ""o-t-íle y-ax•lwala bnòn6x} hóle q†ìl6lle.} ‘The one who is [the one who]
       was eating your children—he has killed him.’ (A24:47)
                     19.5. Conditional ConstructionsConditional constructions consist of two components, the protasis clause,
which presents the condition, and the apodosis clause, which expresses the
consequent to the condition. The protasis is normally placed before the
apodosis, though in some circumstances this is reversed and a condition
of an event or situation is added after the latter has been expressed.
   In most cases the protasis is introduced by the conditional particle
""6n (‘if ’). Occasionally it is introduced by other particles such as madam
(§19.5.7.) or ""5-ga (§19.5.8.). In what follows, we shall classify the condi-
tional constructions with ""6n according to the verb form of the protasis
and the apodosis.","[1034, 1035, 1036, 1037, 1038, 1039, 1040, 1041, 1042, 1043]"
"  (13) A: q6m-qa†èlle ""àrya.} B: là,} dêbba q6m-qa†lále.} ‘A: “A lion killed him.”
       “No, a bear killed him.” ’
                                   the clause                                  857In such constructions, the verb is in the presupposition of the clause,
which in this case is ‘x killed him’. The subject, therefore, is a narrow
new information focus, which asserts the identity of x.
  In (14) the indefinite noun in focus does not have a specific referent:  (14) díga lè-yað6l.} k°ˆ°a yádla.} ‘A cock does not lay eggs. A hen lays eggs.’
       (D1:3)Of a similar structure is (15), in which an indefinite subject with the nuclear
stress on the subject occurs in initial position and the verb is repeated from
the preceding discourse. The subject is not, however, intended to replace
that of the preceding clause but rather it is a component of a separate,
albeit related, event, e.g.  (15) °éle màlla.} . . . mu'àll6m °éle.} ‘A mullah came . . . (then subsequently) a
       teacher came’ (A22:3–5)This again is a kind of new information focus on the subject. The verb
is presented as a presupposition. It is not completely old information
recoverable from the preceding clause, but rather is linked to it in a set
relationship, i.e. the set of the acts of coming.
   A subject that is a non-referential negated constituent is treated like
definite constituents as far as order is concerned and freely occurs in
foreground narrative sections in all contexts, e.g.  (16) ""áp-xa la-šqìlle.} ‘Nobody bought it.’ (A22:6)
  (17) ""áp-xa lá-ßbirre ""asêqle.} ‘Nobody dared to undertake it.’ (A33:4)A subject that is placed before the verb is sometimes presented in a sepa-
rate intonation group, e.g.  (18) náša diyˆni} ""i-ß7mi †¬á yomàne.} ‘Our people fast for three days.’
       (B6:21)
  (19) báb6t bràta} xazéwa yèmm6t bràta.} ‘The father of the girl would see
       the mother of the girl.’ (B5:2)
  (20) mìya} maz6vríle xa-parwàna.} ‘The water drives round a propellor.’
       (B6:53)
  (21) ""ó t-là pál6x} lè y-áx6l.} ‘Whoever does not work does not eat.’
       (A21:13)
858                           chapter seventeen17.7.2.2. Verb—Subject
In clauses expressing a foreground punctual event the subject constituent is
generally postposed after the verb if it introduces a new referent that has
a prominent role in the discourse. In narrative this construction is typically
used when a new protagonist character comes onto the scene, e.g.  (1) °éle màlla.} ‘A mullah came.’ (A22:3)
  (2) °í°5la xa-bràta.} ‘A girl came.’ (A16:2)
  (3) ""ína ""è°y5le xa-yàla,} xa-""aßò†a.} ‘But a tiresome youth came.’ (A17:7)The referent is not necessarily always indefinite. This construction is used
also where the subject is definite, but newly introduced into the discourse.
This is seen in (4), which is the report of an event uttered by the speaker
in isolation without any preceding or immediate following context. The
subject constituent ‘my house’ is definite in status, but newly introduced
and prominent in the mind of the speaker:  (4) ßríx5le yàba} qídle bˆ°i!} ‘He shouted “Oh, my house has burnt down!” ’
      (A48:4)On many occasions, however, the postposition of the subject after the
verb does not have this presentative function that is independent of a
preceding context. Rather, the subject is familiar to the hearer from the
previous context or is, at least, related in some way to the previous con-
text. In such cases the motivation for the construction is to express the
existence of a close semantic relationship of the clause with the preceding
discourse. When it is used in narrative, the close relationship with what
precedes may be one of close temporal sequence and spatial continuity.
The effect is to present the series of clauses as components of the same
overall event. The subject may be the same as that of the preceding main
event clause (5–6) or it may be different (7–8):  (5) mèra gáw‰a ma-yxàl6f.} ""ána b-ßalyàna.} ßlí°5la bàxta.} ‘She said “Hus-
      band, it’s all right. I shall go down (to the town).” The woman went
      down.’ (A22:11)
  (6) mère bráti lá là.} ""áti ""àxl6t.} ""áxni t-àzexi.} lá p5š6x †la-x>dàya.} ""u-qím5le
      màlka.} ‘He said “My daughter, no, no. You eat. We shall go. We
      shall not stay for lunch” and the king got up (to leave).’ (A21:30)
  (7) zìl5le,} qedámta qímt5la bràta-w} mx5lált6lla ""ay-dùk°a.} ‘He went
      away and in the morning the girl got up and cleaned the place.’
      (A17:27)
                                   the clause                                    859  (8)   x°ìm6lle.} kúlle zqìr6lle-w} píšt5la hád6x dèbba gàwe.} ‘He finished
        it. He wove it all and the bear remained inside it.’ (A20:4)As can be seen in the preceding examples, the nuclear stress is normally
placed on the subject constituent. It is occasionally retracted onto the verb,
especially where the speaker wishes to give prominence to a climactic or
important event. In (9), for example, the fall of the fox is a climax:  (9)   mère díya mò t-óðexi?} qú npila-xìla.} qú npila-xìla.} †rípela l-©ðàðe} npìlle
        téla.} ‘He said “Now what shall we do? Come on (let’s fight and)
        whoever falls (first) will be eaten.” They attacked each other and
        the fox fell.’ (A20:10)The verb—subject construction is used in descriptive discourse in a similar
manner to express the close temporal sequence of habitual events. This
is seen in (10)–(12). In (11) and (12) the temporal anteriority of the first
clause is explicitly marked by the conjunction bar ‘after’:  (10) q7mi mpál†i k yálo marqðìla.} bína y-á°i náše qam°èy,} šaqlíla maßlˆla}
       qam-t>r6t-b7°a gò‰ta y-óya.} maduqíla xètna-w k yálo got6-©ðàðe,} ""u-béna
       náše ràqði.} ‘They bring the bride out and make her dance. Then
       people come up to them and take them down to a large space
       outside. They put the groom and bride together side by side and
       then people dance.’ (B5:50)
  (11) bár hàd6x,} bár t-ila-báxta pyáša rásmi tàma} yá'ni wára gu-l-bˆ°a,} °áy5le
       qàša} ""u-sá‰a gnùn5le.} ‘Afterwards, after the woman has become
       official there, that is she enters the house, the priest comes and
       ties the band.’ (B5:44)
  (12) bár mbarxìwa,} ""u-razgìwa} béna y-atwíwa kyálo-w xêtna-w} ‘After-
       wards, after they performed the blessing and were finished, the
       bride and the groom would sit down.’ (B5:30)The postposition of the subject may express cohesiveness with what
precedes in contexts where there is no temporal sequentiality. In (13) the
construction follows the existential clauses that introduce the characters of
the narrative. It coheres with these in that it continues to give background
information that forms the setting for the main narrative. The verbs in
this background setting express habitual rather than punctual actions. The
same applies to the (14), which also occurs in a background section. In
(15) the clause with the postposed subject coheres closely with what
860                         chapter seventeenprecedes in a causal relationship. In (16) the construction supplies supple-
mentary detail to the statement made in the preceding clause:  (13) ""í°wa xa-gáw‰a-w bàxta.} ""í°wala bnòne.} kùt-yum} ßaléwa gàw‰a} l-šùqa}
       msawòqe} ""u-‘ú-m6ndi l7 m5°èwa.} ‘There was a man and a wife. They
       had children. Every day the man would go down to the market to
       do shopping, but would bring nothing back.’ (A22:1)
  (14) ""ítwala xa-qaráw6t gò‰ta.} m5°íwala xadamyá°a díya ""ixàla,} y-ax-
       làwa-w} damxàwa.} ‘She had a big bed. Her servants would bring
       her food, she would eat then go to sleep.’ (A21:1)
  (15) xáze mòdila qèßß6t} míya lˆla °áya.} hóle ßèlya ""o-náša gu-mìya.} ‘He
       saw what the problem was. The water was not flowing (because)
       that man had come down into the water.’ (A22:43)
  (16) šèmša mxí°a l-†uràne,} heš-l7la kmìlta šèmša.} ‘The sunshine has
       struck the mountains, but the sunshine has not yet completely
       (spread).’ (A26:37)The coherence may be one of total overlap, in that the clause is no more
than a reiteration of what precedes, e.g.  (17) wír5le tàma} ""u-dèbba zílt5la tàma.} zílt5la dêbba} ""u-dráy6lla ""íða díya
       ""èlle dìye.} ‘The fox entered there and the bear went there. The bear
       went there and put her paw into it.’ (A20:6)It is worth noting that this coherence principle can also be identified in the
tendency for verb—subject order to be used in syntactically subordinate
clauses, whose close semantic connection with what precedes is signalled
by a subordinating particle. This applies, for example, to purpose clauses
such as (18):  (18) mátt6t q7sa gáwe dìye,} t-lóxi ""ánna qˆse.} ‘You put wood in it and the
       wood blazes up.’ (B15:23)17.7.2.3. Further Remarks on the Function of Subject Position
In general, it can be said that the verb—subject construction is ‘event-
orientated’. When, by contrast, the subject constituent is placed before
the verb, the construction can be said to be ‘topic-orientated’. The shift
of attention from the event-line to a topic referent at the front of a topic-
orientated clause causes it to be interpreted has having a lesser degree of
cohesion with what precedes. In foreground narrative the placement of the
                                  the clause                                  861subject before the verb may be used to express the onset of a new section.
The effect is that the clause is in principle forward looking, cohering with
what follows, rather than cohering with what precedes. In (1) the clause
‘The king became drunk’ with an initial subject follows sequentially the
preceding speech. It is not, however, presented as a tag to this speech but
rather as the onset of an episodic section in which the woman disposed
of his inebriated body. Similarly in (2) the clause ‘The king was perplexed
regarding her (i.e. his daughter)’ is presented as the onset of a section of
discourse that describes his worries about her.  (1) mèra d6-yàlla,} jàlde,} ští ta-t-dàmx6x.} málka rwèle.} rwèle} q6m-doqále

      that we can go to sleep.” ’ The king became drunk. He became
      drunk and she grasped him by his legs, dragged him along and
      took him to the bathroom, then closed the door behind him. She
      came back and went to sleep in her room. She closed the door and
      went to sleep.’ (A17:26)
  (2) †rìsla rába.} málka hírre b-gáne díye bíya dìya.} ""áp-xa l7le gwàr6lla.} mère
      ""ána mò-""oð6n?} xa-‘ára xazèna.} ‘She became very fat. The king was
      perplexed regarding her. Nobody would marry her. He said “What
      should I do? I should find a solution for this daughter of mine.” ’
      (A21:1–2)A shift in subject from that of the immediately preceding discourse is not
always the crucial factor that conditions the placement of the subject in
initial position. This is shown by the fact the speaker in many cases opts
for a verb—subject continuity construction where there is a change of
subject (e.g. §17.7.2.2. examples 7–8). The crucial factor is rather that the
speaker decides to present the clause as disjoined from what precedes in
some way.
   The disjoining expressed by the subject—verb construction sometimes
reflects a lack of temporal sequentiality between the events expressed in
clauses. This is clearly seen in (3) where subject initial clauses are used to
present a listing of events that occurred in parallel. In (4) the subject—verb
clauses expresses an action undertaken by Zine and her servants that over-
laps temporally with that of the preceding clause. The important point
is that in both cases the actions expressed by the subject—verb construc-
tions are presented as distinct events rather than cohering together in a
single overall event:
862                           chapter seventeen  (3) mèra ""ána báxt6t ""á©6t ô?l-iw6n.} ""áyya xmá°a díya homênna.} x6myána

      am the wife of the a©a of ôàl.” Her mother-in-law believed it. Her
      father-in-law believed it. The son believed it. Everybody believed
      it. The daughter-in-law, however, did not believe it.” ’ (A19:2)

      the roof. He went up onto the roof to show him Jazira Bota. Zine
      and her maid-servants went down to the spring.’ (A26:40)In (5) the verb—subject clauses are temporally sequential with what pre-
cedes. The clause ‘The three hundred horsemen returned’, on the other
hand, has a subject—verb structure. This reflects the fact that it is not
directly sequential to what precedes but rather presents a final synopsis
of the overall series of preceding events.  (5) mère sò} kut-qón6x yòma} d7‰i ""èmma m6nnˆxu.} [ VS] ""amrítu ""áxni là-m†el6n

      You will say: We have not reached Jazira Bota. We do not know
      where it is.” Three hundred horsemen went off. Every day a hun-
      dred returned. Everyday a hundred returned. The three hundred
      horsemen returned and said ‘We have not found where Jazira Bota
      is.” ’ (A26:14–15)On some occasions a subject-initial clause is used to introduce a new refer-
ent into a narrative. In such cases the referent generally does not play a
prominent role in the discourse as a whole, although it may have topical
continuity over a series of several clauses. Here the boundary marking
function of the subject—verb construction overrides the presentative func-
tion of the verb—new subject construction, since the latter is used only
to introduce referents of textual importance. This applies to (6)–(8), in all
of which the referents of the subject constituents play only an incidental
role in the discourse:  (6) ""ê°y5le,} qam-t8r6t b7°a tíw5le hàd6x.} bábe díye °èle.} mère ha-bròni,} M9mo}

      of the house. His father came. He said “Ah, my son, M>mo, why
      are you sitting (looking so) sad?” ’ (A26:10)
                                     the clause                                     863  (7)   jênne} t-šmàyya} qímla wídla tàgbir.} ‘The jinn of heaven made a plan.’
        (A26:1)
  (8)   ""árya °éle †álbe dìye.} ‘A lion attacked him.’ (A11:1)In descriptive discourse expressing habitual or generic events, the subject
is in principle placed before the verb in all contexts where the speaker
wishes to present the clause as disjoined in some way from what precedes.
In (9), for example, the subject initial clause ‘The priest would take a long
stick’ opens the section of discourse that describes the geyasa ceremony.
The verb initial clause ‘The people would go and take communion’, on the
other hand, continues the introductory background section. In (10) the
two subject initial clauses express two distinct events that occur in a par-
allel opposition:  (9)  ""o-yóm6t trè t-""éða} y-amríle geyàsa.} geyàsa} yóm6t trè} t-""éða gò‰a.} y-ázi náše

       ‘The second day of the festival was called geyasa (‘the [good] thief ’).
       The geyasa was the second day of the festival. The people would
       go and take communion. The priest would take a long stick. He
       would take it in his hand and make a sign like this on the heads
       of the people, he would tap it on the heads of the people, as

  (10) ""an-t-ìla qam-t9ra t-á°i gawàye,} ""an-gawáye pál†i qam-t9ra.} ‘The ones that
       are outside come inside and the ones inside go outside.’ (B11:9)Generic and proverbial statements, which by their nature stand indepen-
dently of a context, in principle have the subject in initial position, e.g.  (11) mi°7ni dˆ‰i.} ‘Our dead return.’ (A22:37)
  (12) neríya b-gè≥≥e lè-may6°.} ‘A male goat does not die (at the sight of a

864                           chapter seventeen17.7.3. Subject Verb Agreement
In principle, the inflection of the verb agrees in number, gender and person
with the subject nominal. In a few cases, however, there is a discrepancy
of agreement. The attested examples may be classified as follows.
   In clauses with the verbs hwy and pyš that are used existentially with the
subject placed after them, the verb sometimes remains in the 3ms even
when the subject is 3fs. or 3pl., e.g.  (1) píš5le têrte.} ‘Two remained.’ (A22:9)
  (2) píš5le gˆrme.} ‘(Only) bones remained.’ (A2:5)
  (3) q6m-hawéla xá°a yakànta.} ‘An only sister was born to them.’ (A18:1)In a few cases these verbs have 3fs. inflection when the following subject
is plural, e.g.  (4) rába gáye wít5la ""ánna m6ndiyàne.} ‘Many times such things happened.’
      (B5:163)
  (5) ""u-píšt5la ""an-d6bbòre} har-zála-w °àya.} ‘The hornets remained, flying
      back and forth.’ (A20:8)As discussed in §14.2.3., the feminine singular is used in some temporal
adverbial expressions to refer to the general temporal situation in a narra-
tive. This can result in some constructions in which 3fs. verb forms appear
to take a following plural noun as their grammatical subject, e.g.  (6) zílta láxxa tre-†¬à-yarxe,} ""arbà-yarxe,} mère xa-béna xéta mjarbênna.} ‘Two or
      three months, four months passed. He said “I’ll test them again.” ’
      (A48:4)
  (7) y-oráwa kèma yàrxe.} ‘Several months would pass.’ (B5:18)In such cases, however, the 3fs. inflection should be interpreted as refer-
ring to the general temporal situation: ‘(Time) went by (for) two or three
months, four months’, etc.
   In a few cases the verbal agreement is based on the sense rather than
the form of the subject noun. In (8) and (9) the collective nouns ""askar
‘army’ and b6‰-našu°a ‘mankind’ are construed as plural.  (8) ""u-kúlla ""áskar qlíbela píše náše xa-ga-xèta.} ‘All the army returned and
      became men again.’ (A8:83)
  (9) b6‰-našù°a} zlìm6lli.} ‘Mankind has wronged me.’ (A14:34)
                                 the clause                               865A subject constituent consisting of a combination of a 1s. and a 2s. pro-
noun takes 1pl. agreement on the verb, e.g.  (10) ""ána w-áti xon>wà°6x.} ‘You and I are brothers.’ (A15:7)
  (11) ""ána ""u-""áti q†él6n l-d-áwwa šùla.} ‘You and I decided on this matter.’When the conjoining of the subject referent with another referent expresses
a concomitative relationship, the verb sometimes agrees only with the first
referent. This is found when two conjoined pronouns are placed after the
verb, e.g.  (12) kèly5le gu-t8r6t b7°a ""áw ""u-""ày.} ‘He stood at the door of the house
       together with her.’ (A4:55)17.7.4. Independent Subject Pronouns
A pronominal reference to the subject of the clause is contained within
the inflection of a verb and so the additional occurrence of an indepen-
dent subject pronoun is redundant with regard to the identification of
the subject. The use of an independent pronoun does, nevertheless, have
discourse functions. These functions are performed both by independent
pronouns in verbal clauses and also by those that occur in copula clauses.
The following discussion, therefore, will include examples from both verbal
and copula clauses. The subject pronoun may be placed either before or
after the verb/copula.","[895, 896, 897, 898, 899, 900, 901, 902, 903, 904]"
"18.1.3.1. Topical Function
The combination of ""ap with a topical item is found in narratives. It typi-
cally occurs at the beginning of the clause followed by an independent
subject pronoun with a referent that is accessible from the immediately
preceding discourse and constitutes the topical pivot for the new infor-
mation of the clause. This construction generally signals that the clause
is linked sequentially to what precedes but constitutes a boundary in the
discourse. It should be recalled that the use of an independent subject
pronoun rather than zero anaphora is a strategy of ‘heavy coding’ to
mark a boundary (§17.7.4.1.). The particle ""ap is an explicit marker of
connection, which is combined with this boundary marking strategy. The
particle cannot stand independently and must attach itself to a participant
in the clause.
   This construction often occurs at the beginning of a narrative section
that follows direct speech, e.g.
920                            chapter eighteen  (1) m•re ""ámr6t †la-màlka} xzélux b-xêlmux} dúnye ráya tèle.} ""ap-aw-zìl5le} xíša

      where there were wild sheep, such things, partridges, birds, I don’t

      and remained in the mountains one or two days.’ (A4:1–2)

      So, he went and brought the clothes and gave her clothes to her.’
      (A14:83–84)In (5) the topical pronoun at the front of the clause is a direct object:  (5) m•re n•mu l7t-mira t-óð6n b-xàbrux?} ""àyy5la.} b8y6t b9y6t.} la-b8y6t si-prúmle

      this baby to them six months ago.” So, they slaughtered him and
      went on their way.’ (A15:9–10)In (6) the boundary is marked also by the narrative device mara (§15.4.2.3.

        he was hungry, the poor man. He put out some food and ate.’
        (A14:59–60)
In (7) and (8) the clause with initial ""ap opens a foreground narrative sec-
tion after a section giving explanatory background information:  (7)   ""u-""áwwa j8ket d-o-K>rìm-add‰n,} píšt5wa w9d6r,} ""áp-ay †5šíla dêmma}
        ""u-m6ndiyàne,} ""u-ßléla †la-y•mme dìye,} ßléla xaššàne l-b7°a.} ‘The jacket
        of Karimaddin had remained outside. They daubed it in blood
        and the like, then went down to his mother, went down, sad, to
        her house.’ (A14:20)
  (8)   ""ó-yom6t m•ri †lálux hád6x záwna lebàna-wewa.} ""úp-ati xìšlux} m•rux šqíllux
        zúze wélux lebána ""àx-zawna.} ‘The day I said that to you, the time
        was tricky. So you went off, said (this to the king), took the money
        and became tricky like the time.’ (A1:22)The construction is occasionally used to give independence and hence
prominence to a clause or clause group that expresses a climactic event
at the end of a sequence, e.g.  (9)   zíl5le maxéla-""aqle ""•lle dìye} ""ap-""áw ßàle} šám6†le qðàle.} ‘He went and
        kicked him, and he went down (the mountain) and broke his neck.’
        (A15:14)The ""ap particle is in a few cases used as a boundary marker to introduce a
section that supplies background information to the preceding foreground
narrative. This, therefore, has a semantic connection with what precedes
but is not temporally sequential to it, e.g.  (10) ríq5le xà""a.} ""áp-""aw k>‘9la.} ‘One man ran away. He was bald.’
       (B19:8)The particle ""ap is sporadically used with a topical independent pronoun
that does not occur at the beginning of the clause. Such clauses have
greater continuity with what precedes on account of the position of the
topical item. This applies, for example, to (11), where the interpretation
of the phrase ""ap-ànna as an inclusive focus (‘also these’) is not appropri-
ate in the context. Rather the sense is rather topical (‘so . . . these that we
are talking about’):
922                           chapter eighteen  (11) huðáya l-gàre} šwir7le l-pàlga,} yába ""àn6n mšúdr6lla!} ""áy kálba ""ám6r táma

       was me who sent them!” “Oh (you) dog” he says “listening there
       on the roof. So you want to take these (coins). Prepare yourself.
       Tomorrow we shall go to the judge.” (A6:4)18.1.3.2. Focal Function
When combined with an item in focus, the particle ""ap has the inclusive
sense of ‘also’ or ‘even’ (‘not even’ when negated). The inclusive phrase
may occur anywhere in the clause, though it is found predominantly in
initial or final position. The item in focus often takes the nuclear stress,
which is a prosodic marker of prominence, e.g.  (1)   ""ap-àna mja‰b•nna} ˙àÄÄ díyi.} ‘I also shall try my luck.’ (A1:4)
  (2)   ""àp-t6mm6l ""áxl6x m•nna.} ‘We could eat them also tomorrow.’ (A2:2)
  (3)   ""ap-šlàma l7la d•ry6lle.} ‘They did not offer him even a greeting.’
        (A15:13)
  (4)   xuš-p7š6n képa ""ap-àna.} ‘Let me also become a stone.’ (A8:55)
  (5)   sab-wít5la b-réši ""up-àyya.} ‘Because this also happened to me.’ (B15:85)
  (6)   ""ána l7-yaw6nne ""àp-xa-f6lsa.} ‘I shall not give him even a penny.’On numerous occasions, however, the phrase with ""ap does not bear the
nuclear stress. In such cases the prosody signals a broad focus but the
particle signals the informational focus on the phrase, a focus within a
focus as it were, e.g.  (7) ""ap-xmárey šqìl6lla.} ‘They took also their asses.’ (A7:15)
  (8) ""áp-aw táma mìtle.} ‘Also he died there.’ (A25:90)
  (9) ""7-ga ""áp-ana b8y6n ""àz6n.} ‘So I also want to go.’ (A1:5)
  (10) ""ap-míya muklèle gu-d-5-sálla.} ‘He could hold even water in the basket.’
       (A16:10)
  (11) hád6x ""áp-ati ""ê°y6t.} ‘Meanwhile you also came.’ (A2:9)
  (12) ""áp-ani drì°6lla.} ‘She put also these onto it.’ (A13:13)
  (13) m5°7la ""ap-áni l-bêdra.} ‘They bring also these to the threshing-floor.’

       I’ll divide into halves also all the money that I took.’ (A1:17)
  (17) max-t-íla brátux mšuyðànta,} ""ap-àw,} ""6n-lá-""az6n mšàyð6n.} ‘Just as your
       daughter has gone mad, he also, if I do not go back, will go mad.’ (A4:27)On some occasions a nominal that is within the inclusive focus of the
particle is extraposed at the front of the clause and the particle is com-
bined with a resumptive pronoun, e.g.  (18) qaríwa y-áwe m•nne díye ""ap-àw} ‘The best man also would be with
       him.’ (B5:29)
  (19) láxma ""íle ""ap-áw m6n-xê††e,} ‘Bread is also (made) from wheat.’ (B5:98)
  (20) b•†me ""ap-""áni ""ì°ena.} ‘There are also terebinth nuts.’ (B5:221)The phrase ""ap-xa is used in negated clauses in the sense of ‘nobody’, e.g.  (21) ""áp-xa l5le-mßáya mbasêmla.} ‘Nobody can cure her.’ (A4:12)
  (22) ""áp-xa lá-biš-ile-mßaya mqarów-6lla dìya.} ‘Nobody was able to go near
       her at all.’ (A4:6)
  (23) ""àp-xa l7la-xzaya.} ‘She sees nobody.’ (A4:38)When combined with the preposition m6n ‘from’, the phrase ""ap-xa has
the sense of ‘none’ from a collective set or ‘neither’ from a set of two
items, e.g.  (24) ""úp-xa m6nn7xu là-mqab6lle šláme.} ‘None of you should accept his
       greeting.’ (A25:47)
  (25) ""úp-xa m•nna lá-wewa klàya.} ‘Neither of them had stopped (before-
       hand), but were constantly crying.’ (A25:5)18.1.4. –≥i
The suffixed particle –≥i, which sometimes occurs in the augmented form
-≥ig6n, has a function that is similar to that of the particle ""ap. As with ""ap,
the function of –≥i depends on the informational status of the item it is
attached to, namely whether it is topical or focal.
924                             chapter eighteen18.1.4.1. Topical Function
The particle is often attached to a clause initial nominal or independent pro-
noun that has topical status, in that it has been referred to in the preceding
discourse and is the pivot for the new information of the clause. The
particle can be interpreted as enhancing the topical prominence of the
initial item. This reinforces the boundary marking function of the clause
initial topic. In most cases the initial topical item is the grammatical sub-
ject. This often constitutes a shift in subject referent from the preceding
discourse, as in (1–4). The clause may be sequential to what precedes
(1–3) or overlapping temporally with it (4):  (1) m•re yába hàyyo,} ""a°ìtu,} ‘ìdetu} ta-mšax•lpi š•mm6t ’ùxo} mattúle xá-š6mma
      xèna.} ""ánna-≥i ""ê°yela.} xìlela-w} šêtyela.} ‘He said “Come, come, you are
      invited” in order for them to change the name ’uxo and give him a
      another name. They came. They ate and drank.’ (A7:3)
  (2) dmìxela.} xá-bena xéta qìmela} qèdamta.} yála-≥ig6n qím5le f†ìr5le} mxúll6lla
      pá°e dìye-w} ""u-zíl5le šúle dìye.} ‘They went to sleep. Again they got up
      in the morning. The young man got up and had breakfast, washed
      his face and went to his work.’ (A21:16)
  (3) qímela mšux•lpe b-jùlle.} ""awwá-≥i zìl5le.} ""5-kusí°a múßl6lla gu-""7ne díye t-’ùxo.}
      ‘They exchanged clothes. He (the shepherd) went and lowered the
      hat of ’uxo over his eyes.’ (A7:19)
  (4) mubsêmlux,} ˙uriyy?t.} w-ána q6m-maxˆli} w-áti xyára bìyi.} ""ána-≥i m-k7rbi
      ""•°y6n ""á-k°5°a mútt6nna r6š-núra ""u-xìl6nna.} ‘You enjoyed yourself (with)
      houris. But they beat me while you were looking at me. I, out of my
      anger, came and put the chicken on the fire and ate it.’ (A2:10–11)The particle occurs in constructions where two topics are set up in a
disjunctive opposition (‘either x or y’), as in (5), where the nuclear stress
occurs on the subject constituent since the lexical content of the verb is
given information:  (5) har-déwe t-axlìli.} har-t-áz6n gu-d-ànna hambišáye} har-hambišàye-≥i t-axlíli.}
      ‘(Either) the wolves are sure to eat me (or) I shall go to these giants
      and the giants are sure to eat me.’ (A39:4)In some cases the subject constituent continues that of the preceding
discourse, but the construction nevertheless marks a boundary on some
other level of the discourse. In (6), for example, the clause ""áwwa-≥i q•ry6lla
                               clause sequences                                925(‘He called to them’) marks the onset of a section where the protagonist
engages directly with the inhabitants of the town, whereas in what pre-
cedes he surveys the scene:  (6) xuláßa ""aláha mut•pq6lle gu-d-a-mðíta t-íla ""5-bráta d-o-màlka.} x•zy6lla náše
      jêmye} qúrb6t qáßr6t màlka,} kút-xa mßawó°e xà-m6ndi,} kút-xa mára xà-m6ndi.}
      ""áwwa-≥i q•ry6lla m•re mòdila q•ßß6t?} ‘In the end God made him come
      across the town where the daughter of that king was. He saw the
      people gathered near the palace of the king, each one saying some-
      thing, each one telling something. He called to them and said “What
      has happened?” ’ (A4:11)If the clause with the initial topic is negated, it may stand in an adversa-
tive relationship to what precedes, e.g.  (7) ""ó-yòm t-ìle plí†a} bróne díye mì°5le.} ""u-""áxni-≥i láx muqíme m-bá°re díye
      màlka.} ‘On the day he left, his son died. But we have not installed
      (another) king after him.’ (A4:32)18.1.4.2. Focal Function
When the particle is attached to a nominal constituent that is in focus it
has the inclusive sense of ‘also’ or ‘even’. The focused item, which may
occur anywhere in the clause, generally takes the nuclear stress, e.g.  (1) ""ána hadíya m-kêsl6n °áya.} ""u-b8ye ""á°e xazèlux} ""u-qa-t xazéla bràta-≥i.} ‘I
      am now coming back from him and he wants to come to see you and
      to see also the girl.’ (A4:24)
  (2) ""u-b-l7le t-yánne xa-bàxta-≥i} ‘And at night I shall give him also a
      woman.’ (A14:63)
  (3) ""ítle t8ra gu-˙adìqa} ""u-""ítle dàrga-≥ig6n.} ‘There was a door in the garden
      and there was also a main gate.’ (A17:23)
  (4) ""6n-háwe dàwa-≥i} ""áxni t-yaw•xla xa-b-†¬à°a ""•lle díye.} ‘Even if it is gold,
      we shall give him threefold (if it is lost).’ (A7:10)On a few occasions the nuclear stress is placed elsewhere in the intona-
tion group, e.g.  (5) d•ry6lla š-qaràw6t,} ""ánna wajjúwe díya-≥i mútt6lla tàma.} ‘They put her on
      the bed and they also put her effects there.’ (A21:7)
926                             chapter eighteenThe particle is occasionally attached to a verb in order to express the climax
of a sequence of events. This may be regarded as a focal inclusive function,
marking explicitly that the verb is to be included in the sequence, e.g.  (6) síq5le šqílle xa-kèpa} mútt6lla ""àxxa} kalêb°a,} q†ìl6lla,} dêry6lla,} mqulêbz6lla-
      ≥i.} ‘He went up and took a stone, put the dog here, killed it and
      (finally) turned it upside down.’ (A30:20)18.1.5. ""ina
The basic function of this particle is presentative, i.e. it draws attention to
something. The item to which attention is directed may be a referent or a
proposition. The contexts where it is most commonly used are as follows.","[958, 959, 960, 961, 962, 963, 964, 965]"
"  (39) A: módit xèzya gu-bˆ°a?} B: k°àwux-in xèzya gu-b7°a.} ‘A: “What have
       you seen in the house?” B: “I have seen your book in the house.” ’
  (40) Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} yá'ni xá°6t Mir-Zàndin-ile šqíla Qára Tè≥din.}
       ‘Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law, that is Qara Te≥din has married
       the sister of Mir-Zandin.’ (A26:55)
  (41) ""àyy6n ""ána wíða bíya díya.} ‘I did this with her.’ (A21:40)When a narrow focus is put on some element of the clause other than the
direct object, the agreement pronoun is used with a definite object, e.g.  (42) ""àtit mú°y6lle †7ri?} mère hè} ""àn6n mú°y6lle †7r6x.} ‘ “Did you bring my
       bird?” He said “Yes, I brought your bird.’ ” (A24:32)
  (43) ""àtit q†íl6lle xúwwe?} ‘Did you kill the snake?’ (A24:45)If, on the other hand, the object nominal is set up as a topic referent at
the front of the clause rather than as a narrow focus, there is an increased
tendency for object agreement to occur. This can be seen when this
construction occurs in the contexts which have been identified above
as reducing the tendency for the occurrence of object agreement. The
passage in (44), for example, constitutes a preliminary background sec-
tion to the narrative, which explains why the object agreement has been
omitted in the clauses masqíwa ""6rwèy} (‘They would bring up their sheep’)
and m5°5-""6rwèy} (‘They bring their sheep’). By contrast, in the clause
""6rwéy masqíla l-gár6t ""ùmra} (‘They would take their sheep onto the roof of
the church’), in which the object is placed at the front as a topic, there
is object agreement, despite the fact that this is in the same background
section of the discourse.  (44) ""u-""ím6 t-áwe qˆ†a,} b5hˆr,} masqíwa ""6rwèy} maßày6f } gu-†uràne,}
       y-amríla zawzàne.} béna y-à°i} góta góta d-ˆ-ma°a,} ""i-p7ši ""árxe d-ˆ-ma°a.}
       ""6rwéy masqíla l-gár6t ""ùmra.} sab-gár6t ""úmra l-bá°re díye m†í°5la
       l-†ùra,} hátxa ramàn5 †úra.} ""u-gár6t ""úmra hàtx5le.} y-á°i ßàli,}—yá'ni máße
       náša t-ás6q l-gáre b-s>này} m5°5-""6rwèy} masqìla l-gáre.} ‘When it
       was Summer and Spring, they would bring their sheep up to the
       summer pastures in the mountains, which are called zawzane. So,
       they would come alongside that village and become guests of the
       village. They would take their sheep onto the roof of the church.
                             the syntax of verbs                               779      This was because the roof of the church at its back extended to
      the mountain, so high was the mountain. The roof of the church
      was like that. They would come and go down (the mountain),—a
      person could easily go onto the roof—bring their sheep and take
      them onto the roof.’ (B18:1–2)15.13.2.2. Indefinite Direct Object Nominals
As a general rule there is no pronominal agreement on the verb when
the direct object is indefinite, e.g.  (1) mère là} ta-t-óð6n qáp6x ""àp †la-réš6x.} ‘No, not until I make a lid also
      for your head.’ (A20:3)
  (2) ya-""alàha,} yawètl6n xa-bròna.} ‘Oh God, give us a son.’ (A15:17)
  (3) xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa} ""u-t-yáxla ""èlle dìye.} ‘Let’s look for a
      man who is a hard worker and give her to him.’ (A21:3)
  (4) mšádr6n m5xòlta ""èlle díye.} ‘I shall send food to him.’ (A17:11)
  (5) ""ána m-7ka m5°ènnux qˆse?} m-7ka m5°ènnux b6zmàre?} ‘From where
      should I bring you wood? From where should I bring you nails?’
      (A17:3)
  (6) x6zyéla nèra.} ‘They saw a river.’ (A17:3)
  (7) qímt5la šqílt5la xa-bròna.} ‘She got up and took a son (of hers).’
      (A19:3)
  (8) wúð ða-spayú°a mênni!} ‘Do me a favour!’ (A7:17)In certain circumstances, however, there is pronominal agreement with
indefinite direct objects. In general this is found where the object has
some kind of topical prominence in that it plays a central role in the
immediately ensuing discourse, in which it is referred to pronominally.
This is attested both where the indefinite object has a specific referent
and also where it has a non-specific referent. Objects with non-specific
referents are typically found with verbs expressing habitual activities. These
typically do not have the same referent on each occurrence of the activ-
ity. What is important, however, is that within one particular sequence
of events involving one occasion of this activity, one specific referent is
durable across all events:  (9) xazéla xá parizàda,} xá šapìrta,} brát6t málka t-Mà©r6b,} hóle šqíl6lla
      Déwa Zàr,} hóle mú°y6lla gu-d-ˆ g6ppí°a.} ‘He finds a princess, a beautiful
      woman, the daughter of the king of Morocco, whom Dewa Zar
      had taken and brought to the cave.’ (A28:17)
780                            chapter fifteen  (10) b-lˆlela,} plí††5la zìlt5la} xzí°6lle xa-nàša.} ‘At night she went out
       and found a man (this referent plays a central role in what follows).’
       (A22:36)
  (11) qáša šaqèlle xa-q7sa rìxa.} b-""íðe díye dawùqle} ""i-ráš6m hátxa gu-réš6t
       nàše} maxéle gu-réš6t nàše,} ""áx burkà°a.} ‘The priest would take a long
       stick. He would take it in his hand and make a sign like this on the
       heads of the people, he would tap it on the heads of the people,
       as blessings.’ (B6:3)
  (12) áa¬éla xa-ßiníye gò‰ta.} maßléla mattúla xà-duk°a.} ‘(Each) fills
       a large tray and brings it down and places it in a certain place.’
       (B6:23)
  (13) xìrre} x6zyále ðà xúrta.} xúrta ""íla ""ilána rìxta.} dalí°a xðíta-""6lla síqta
       á¬í°a ""ênwe.} ða-xúrta ramànt5la.} ‘He looked and saw a poplar tree.
       A poplar is a tall tree. A vine full of grapes had grown up around
       it. It was a high poplar.’ (A43:1–2)Such indefinite nominals with topically prominent referents are sometimes
placed before the verb, e.g.  (14) xèlya mar6x°ìle} ""u-šoqíle p7ša d8raj ˙>rára díye taqríban ""àrbi.} d7ri
       marˆ°a bíya.} ‘They boil milk and let its heat become about forty
       degrees. They put rennet in it.’ (B6:37)
  (15) sá‰e xašlèxwala b-xašùlta.} ""u-mpart6nêxwala} ""u-qašrêxwala.} ‘We
       would crush barley in a mortar. We winnowed it and removed the
       peel.’ (B10:12)The very process of fronting the indefinite nominal before the verb to
present it as the topic of the clause endows it with topical prominence
and this alone can condition verb agreement, even if the referent does
not play a central role in the immediately following discourse. This applies
to the referents of the nominals qualified with the universal quantifier in
(16) and (17), e.g.  (16) kút-xa q6m-xašèlle ða-gòta.} ‘He threw each one down to one side.’
       (A29:56)
  (17) ""u-kúl-xa t7ra m†alìwala.} ‘They played every type (of game).’
       (B7:6)When a fronted object nominal is a narrow focus, however, the verb does
not have an agreement pronoun, e.g.
                             the syntax of verbs                               781  (18) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} xàwx5le xíla xóni.} l7le xabùša xíla.} ‘A:
       “Your brother has eaten an apple.” B: “No, my brother has eaten
       a peach. He has not eaten an apple.’ ”
  (19) ""u-suráye lˆla jrá†a} sab-zargùlela lwíše.} ‘The Christians were not slip-
       ping since they were wearing sheepskin shoes.’ (B19:7)15.13.3. Independent Pronouns
Independent personal or demonstrative pronouns are occasionally used
in the direct object position. In such cases there is generally agreement
on the verb in the form of a coreferential pronominal element, except in
the aforementioned circumstances where agreement tends to be omitted,
e.g.  (1)   dáx p5rmènne ""àwwa?} ‘How can I slaughter him?’ (A15:9)
  (2)   ""áwwa xá-ga xéta d5r7le gu-mìya.} ‘They put it again in water.’
        (B6:44)
  (3)   lát-°i°a ""ána mpaló†6lli m-gu-sêj6n.} ‘You did not come to take me out
        of jail.’ (A26:82)In (4)–(6) the independent object pronoun is in narrow focus and the
agreement is omitted:  (4)   ""ána ""àti b8y6n.} ‘I want you.’ (A25:31)
  (5)   ""àyya b8y6n.} ‘I want her.’ (A8:91)
  (6)   m7°6x ""ày k6sle-díye.} ‘Let’s take her to him.’ (A4:3)It should be noted, however, that there is a greater tendency for the
agreement element to be omitted when the object is a 3pl. demonstra-
tive pronoun than there is with other types of independent pronominal
object, e.g.  (7)   pálš6x ""áni. ‘Let’s fight them.’ (A14:52)
  (8)   bár d-ày,} xá-tre yomà°a,} y-a°ˆwa} áa¬7wa ""áni mìya.} ‘One or two days
        after that they would come and fill them with water.’ (B5:77)
  (9)   qím5le šqìla-ani.} ‘He took them.’ (A17:13)
782                          chapter fifteen15.13.4. General Remarks Concerning Object Agreement
Taking into account all the various factors discussed above, it appears that
the basic motivation for object agreement is the existence of some kind
of prominence of the verbal predicate. The tendency for the agreement
to occur with definite direct objects rather than indefinite ones can be
correlated with a high degree of transitivity according to Hopper and
Thompson’s scale of transitivity (1980), in which ‘individuation’ of the
object is a factor bringing about high transitivity. This would also apply
to the exceptions to this rule with regard to definite objects that are
inalienable possessions of the subject and indefinite objects that play a
prominent discourse role, which may be interpreted as having a reduced
or enhanced degree of individuation respectively. This high transitivity can
be said to give the verbal predicate a higher degree of prominence. The
reduced likelihood of object agreement in verbal predicates that occur in
background clauses is due to the reduced prominence of the clause as a
whole due to its status in the discourse rather than the properties of its
components. Similarly, the lack of agreement with objects that constitute
a narrow focus arises from the consequential reduction in the prominence
of the verb relative to that of the object due to the pragmatic relation
between the object and the clause rather than the pragmatic property, i.e.
definiteness, of the object. The explanation for the increased tendency
for agreement to occur when the object is topicalized at the front of the
clause is likely to be that constructions with fronted topical constituents
are typically used as a strategy for disjoining in some way the clause from
what precedes in order to mark a boundary in the discourse (§17.7.2.3.,
§17.7.5.2.). The function of boundary marker gives the clause, including
the verb, a enhanced degree of prominence.","[817, 818, 819, 820, 821]"
"14.2.4. Object Pronoun
In a number of expressions a 3fs. object pronoun on a verb has no clear
referent. The purpose of this otiose object appears to be to denote the
telicity of the verb. In (1), for example, the verb phrase mtagbêrra denotes
that the man administers something and achieves a result, whereas the
form mtagb6r without the object could be construed as non-telic, denoting
466                           chapter fourteenthat he administers without necessarily achieving a result. In (2) the verb
q6m-jarála denotes not only that the cat engaged in the activity of urinating,
but also that it completed the activity, fully emptying its bladder. The same
applies to the act of defacation in (3). In (4) and (5) the object pronoun
conveys the sense of finality in the act of surrender.  (1) bíš-y>ðe mtagbêrra.} ‘He knows better how to deal with things.’
      (A30:2)
  (2) qá†u krìbla,} q6m-jarála gu-nùra.} ‘The cat was angry and urinated in
      the fire.’ (A34:8)
  (3) kút-ile xíl6lla xa-ràmši-m6ndi} gu-bˆ°i} ""á°e xarèla gu-b7°i.} ‘Everyone who
      has eaten my dinner or the like (i.e. any food) in my house, let him
      come and defecate in my house.’ (A7:5)
  (4) lá q6m-mattúla qam-màlka.} ‘He did not surrender to the king.’
      (A27:1)
  (5) m-xúwwe hon-muxêrw6lla.} ‘I have wrecked it with the snake’ (i.e. I
      have wrecked my relationship). (A1:10)An intransitive verb may be given a complement of a prepositional phrase
containing a 3fs. non-referential pronominal suffix. Again the effect is to
express telicity and hence greater salience and force, e.g.  (6) ""ána zála har-zíl6n bìya.} ‘I have absolutely gone with it!’ (i.e. I am
      finished!) (A14:25)14.2.5. Meteorological Expressions
In some expressions relating to the weather a 3fs. inflection is used with-
out any explicit subject, e.g. tèmm6l rìt5la} ‘Yesterday it rained’, bt-àrya} ‘It
will rain’, ""èdyo šaxìnta} ‘Today it is hot’. In such cases the subject should
be understood as the feminine noun dunye ‘world, weather’, which is
used in other meteorological expressions such as dúnye ràya} ‘It is raining’,
dúnye šaxìnta} ‘It is hot’, dúnye x6mmànta} ‘It is hot’. Note also expressions
of temperature such as (1)–(3), where the implicit subject again can be
interpreted as dunye:  (1) q6m-x>ðíla hátxa t-la-q5ralèy.} ‘They wrapped them up, like this, so
      that they would not be cold.’ (A8:12)
  (2) wít5la xá‘‘a b-yóma xêmma.} ‘It became rather hot during the day.’
      (A14:68)
                          the syntax of nominals                           467  (3)   ta-t-óya šaxínta b-sètwa ""6llèy.} ‘So that it will be warm for them in
        the winter.’ (B14:9)
                     14.3. Demonstrative Pronouns14.3.1. Preliminary Remarks
The demonstrative pronouns may qualify a noun or stand independently.
When they qualify a noun, they are regularly placed before the noun, e.g.
""áwwa gáw‰a ‘this man’, ""áyya báxta ‘this woman’, ""ánna náše ‘these people’,
etc. They may be combined with nouns that have possessive pronominal

   Independent demonstrative pronouns may stand in any syntactic posi-
tion in a clause, including subject, predicate, direct object of a verb or
complement of a preposition or particle. In the majority of attested cases

        (A26:66)The independent demonstrative pronouns function as 3rd person personal
pronouns. The distribution of the independent demonstrative pronouns
is wider than that of 1st and 2nd person personal pronouns, which can
occupy the subject, direct object or predicate positions of clause, but can-
not be the complement of prepositions.","[504, 505, 506, 507]"

       (A11:20)In a few sporadic cases the subject intervenes between the interrogative
particle and the verb, e.g.  (18) mút ""áti tíwta làxxa?} ‘Why are you sitting here?’ (A25:58)The interrogative particle mo is used to express exclamation in construc-
tions such as (19), in which the verb is repeated:  (19) qìmta} mgašóqe hàtxa,} mo-mgàšqa!} ‘She got up and looked and what
       (a sight) she sees!’ (A25:59)
                                  the clause                             889This construction is used also with intransitive verbs, e.g.  (20) ""ánna ßàli} ""ína mò ßáli!} ‘They went and what (a surprise when) they
       went down! (A25:13)
  (21) dmíx5le xá-bena ‰ày6š} ""ina mò ‰áy6š!} ‘He went to sleep, then woke up,
       but what (a surprise when) he woke!’ (A14:30)The adverbial interrogative particle dax is used also in a longer form daxi.
The occurrence of the longer form is prosodically conditioned, in that it
occurs predominantly in pause at the end of an intonation group, as is
the case with the long forms of verbal inflections (§15.12.), e.g.  (22) dàxi?} ‘How (could this be)?’ (A25:69)
  (23) báxta dìya dáxi?} ‘Wife, now how (can we solve the problem)?’
       (A20:9)17.7.14. Negated Verbal Clauses17.7.14.1. Negative Particle before Verb
When a verbal clause is negated, the negative particle la is normally
placed immediately before the verb. Various stress patterns are attested
in relation to this particle. In some cases it is stressed and in others it is
unstressed (§6.4.). It takes the nuclear stress of the intonation group when
the speaker wishes to give the negation particular prominence. This is
found predominantly in the following circumstances.(i) Negated Deontic Expressions
When the negated verb has a deontic modality, such as a prohibition
addressed to the hearer or an expression of deontic intention by the
speaker, the negator is often given prominence, e.g.  (1)   là mtalpètle} là-daqr6t bíye.} ‘Do not harm him! Do not touch him!’
        (A26:73)
  (2)   là maßí°6t!} ‘Do not listen!’ (A26:11)
  (3)   là-mßaw°6t!} ‘Do not speak!’ (A26:89)
  (4)   bróni là q6†lúle!} ‘Do not kill my son!’ (A33:6)
  (5)   là maštóla míya!} ‘Do not give them water to drink!’ (A25:9)
  (6)   ""ána là-""a°6n mènnux!} ‘I shall not come with you!’ (A6:6)
  (7)   là-""awr6n gu-má°a!} ‘I shall not go into the village!’ (A25:34)
890                          chapter seventeen(ii) Adversative Contexts
The negator is given prominence when the clause defeats an expectation
that arises from what precedes, e.g.  (1) spírra spìrra} bróna díya là °éle.} ‘She waited and waited, but her son
      did not come.’ (A14:21)
  (2) ták-tak mxáy6lla goyá°6 sùsa} ta-t-dày6‰ súsa m-táma,} là-jwijle súsa.} ‘He
      struck the sides of the horse so that the horse would move away
      from there, (but) the horse did not move.’ (A26:28)
  (3) mèra t-ásq6n ta-t-axèlli xùwwe.} mère ""ána t-á°6n mênn6x.} ""áti xúwwe là
      ""axèll6x.} ‘She said “I am going up in order for the snake to eat
      me.” He said “I shall come with you. The snake will not eat you.” ’
      (A24:39)(iii) Contrastive Oppositions
When the negated clause is set up in a contrastive opposition with what
precedes, the negator, which is the focus of contrast, has the nucleus,
e.g.  (1) mèra ""ána báxt6t ""á©6t ô?l-iw6n.} ""áyya xmá°a díya homênna.} x6myána
      homênne.} bróna homênne.} kúlla homênna.} kál°a là homènna.} ‘She said “I
      am the wife of the a©a of ôàl.” Her mother-in-law believed it. Her
      father-in-law believed it. The son believed it. Everybody believed
      it. The daughter-in-law, however, did not believe it.” ’ (A19:2)
  (2) réši parmênne} ""u-réš6x là parmènne.} ‘I shall cut off my head. I shall not
      cut off your head’ (A14:35)(iv) Verb mßy ‘to be able’  (1) ""ána là-mß6n t-á°6n mènnux hátxa.} ‘I cannot come with you in that
      case.’ (A26:18)
  (2) ""ána là-mß6n ma°yánne.} ‘I cannot bring him back.’ (A25:75)
  (3) †¬á gáye súse dìye} °éle ta-t-šàw6r} là mßéle.} ‘Three times his horse came
      up to jump but could not do so.’ (A25:55)
  (4) zmìrra,} là-mßela bíyi.} ‘She sang and could not beat me.’ (A25:69)(v) Negator Combined with Intensifier
In some cases a negator with the nuclear stress is combined with the
intensifying particle xo-/xu-, e.g.
                                   the clause                                  891  (1) xo-là p7š6n š>vána-llux.} ‘I shall not become a shepherd for you.’
      (A25:32)
  (2) ""áxni b>yèxwa t-a°êxwa.} xu-là-mßaya t-a°èxwa t-amrèxwal6x.} ‘We wanted
      to come back, but we could not come back to tell you.’ (A14:21)
  (3) yába ""an-""èmma dàwe,} xu-là mbaqrêt6lli.} ‘Well, do not ask me about
      those hundred gold coins.’ (A14:65)17.7.14.2. Negative Particle before Other Constituents
The negative particle is sometimes placed before another component of
the clause that intervenes before the verb. This is found in the following
circumstances:(i) Verb Not in Scope of Negation
One context where this is found is where the scope of the negator
includes this item but not the verb. In order for it to be within the scope
of the negation, it must be in the focus component of the clause. There
is, therefore, a narrow focus on the negated item, with the verb being in
the presupposition. The nuclear stress is sometimes, though not regularly,
placed on the negator before the item in narrow focus, as in (1)–(4):  (1) xzèla} ""ína núra †èpya b-b7°e dìye,} ""ína là-b5°a qíða,} xá‘‘a q7se rè˙qa m6n-
      bˆ°e.} ‘They saw that fire had been kindled in his house, but his
      house had not burnt down, only a few sticks far from his house
      (had burnt).’ (A48:3)
  (2) ""è°yela hìw6lla} ""áy mèra lˆk6t naból6lli?} mère ""ána làn †láli naból6ll6x.}
      naból6ll6x †la-d-áwwa dewêrr6š.} ‘She said “Where are you taking me?”
      He said “I am not taking you for myself. I am taking you for this
      vagabond.” ’ (A12:35)
  (3) là-kulley yapáwa.} ‘Not all of them used to bake.’ (B5:17)
  (4) ""áx‘i là gu-""Ôn6 Núne q6m-""oðènne ""éða,} q6m-""oðènwale gu-Dòhok.} ‘But I did
      not spend the festival in ""“n-Nune, I spent it in Dohok.’ (B15:9)
  (5) lá kulla-náše y8ði t-oðìla.} ‘Not all people know how to make it.’
      (B10:22)
  (6) ""áxni lá raba-""i-map6lxêxwala.} ‘We do not use it much.’ (B10:18)
  (7) ""ilan5ni t-xabušta. m-reša-w š6tta mnoqašta. l-Yaws6p zwinta b-dabašta. nèmu
      ""áxni xlúl6t Gwèrg6s la-xálti zwínna kéke dìye} mèra ða-dabàšta?} ‘ “Our
      tree is an apple tree. It is decorated above and below. It has been
      bought by Yaws6p for a beehive.” [wedding song] At the wedding
      of Gw6rg6s was it not my aunt who bought his cake and say “(I
      buy it) for a beehive?” ’ (B8:29–30)
  (8) xo-lán har-""ána gàw‰a.} ‘I am not the only man.’ (A26:79)
892                          chapter seventeenConstructions such as (9) and (10), in which the verb has been gapped,
can be included here:  (9)  ""áni maßlèxwa ""êrxe,} †axnêxwala.} là kúlla náše.} bas-""àxni.} ‘We brought
       them down to the water-mill and ground them. Not everybody,
       but we did (this).’ (B10:88)
  (10) mattátla xa-kawáz6t míya k6s-réša-w bàs,} la-""ixàla,} la-lêxma.} ‘You should
       put out for her a jar of water by her head and that’s all, not food,
       nor bread.’ (A21:10)In (11) the item in the scope of negation is placed after the verb, with the
negative particle used both before this item and the verb:  (11) lá d5r7le là r6š-séla} ""i-maxíle gu-tanùra.} ‘They do not place it on a
       griddle, they place it in the oven.’ (B6:49)(ii) Constituents Coordinated in a Set Relation
The negative particle is placed before a subject constituent when the latter
is placed at the front of a clause in order to establish it in a set relationship
with an item in a coordinated adjacent clause and the scope of negation
includes the subject, e.g.  (1)   la-k yàsa m>ráwa} ""u-la-xàßa m>réwa,} la-∂á©a† y-awèwale.} ‘(One’s) stom-
        ach did not ache, (one’s) back did not ache and one did not have
        (high blood) pressure.’ (B5:31)
  (2)   ""ána lˆ-gor6n,} la-""àti gáwr6t.} ‘I shall not marry, so long as you do not
        marry.’ (A25:83)
  (3)   la-""áxnix xàla} ""u-lá sus>wà°6n xála.} ‘Neither are we eating nor are
        our horses eating.’ (A26:16)If the items that are coordinated in a set relationship across a series of
two or more clauses are not subject constituents, a second negator is often
placed before the item in question, in addition to a negator in the normal
position in the clause, e.g.  (4)   lá-karmi l5le-m>dò‰e} ""u-la-˙áqq6t kàrmi l5le-yáwa.} ‘He does not return
        my orchard nor does he pay the price.’ (A17:30)Constituents that are coordinated in this way include the resultative par-
ticiple and infinitive of compound verbal constructions, e.g.
                                   the clause                                  893  (5)   ""o-déwa l7le lá plìxa} ""u-lá zêrya} ""u-lá xzìda.} ‘That wolf has neither
        worked, nor cultivated, nor harvested.’ (A10:3)We see from (5) that the items are not necessarily placed at the front of
the clause but may remain in their normal position.
   The verb may be gapped after the first clause of the coordinated series,
e.g.  (6)   ""ána lànwa wíða} là x6rbayú°a} là spayú°a †la-‘ú-naša.} ‘I have not done
        evil or good to anybody.’ (A14:23)
  (7)   ""ána làn dmíxa,} là-b-l5le,} là-b-yoma.} ‘I have not slept, neither at night
        nor during the day.’ (A24:24)
  (8)   lá-b>y6x la-mìya} ""u-la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘We do not want water or anything
        else.’ (A39:12)A series of negated verbal predicates may be coordinated with this type
of construction, e.g.  (9)   šuréle mtaxmòne.} gu-d-áy taxmànta} †¬á yomàne} l7le la-xíla-w la-šêtya} ""u-
        la-dmìxa.} ‘He began to think. He was (immersed) in this musing
        for three days without eating or drinking or sleeping.’ (A26:19)In (10) the Arabic particle walla ‘and not’ is used by the speaker in this
type of construction:  (10) le-šóq6n lá xolamwà°a} wálla ""àti} wálla yêmmi} wálla ‘u-nàša.} ‘I shall not
       let servants, you, mother or anybody (look after them).’ (A8:18)Similar constructions are attested with existential particles, in which the
negator is either repeated (11) or is placed only before the item in focus
(12):  (11) lí° là-xmara mènne díye} la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘There was not an ass with him,
       nor anything (else).’ (A22:25)
  (12) la-bàba ""ítle,} la-yêmma ""ítle.} ‘He does not have a father and he does
       not have a mother.’ (A14:16)The unusual construction in (13) with the sequence la ""itle rather than
litle may perhaps be understood in this light. The noun nx6p°a ‘shame’ is
established in a set relationship with what precedes in order to explain
the meaning of the latter:
894                         chapter seventeen  (13) xzí hátxa be-nxêp°5le.} lá ""ítle nxêp°a} ‘Look, he is so shameless. He
       has no shame.’ (A6:11)In certain circumstances a negative particle is placed before an infinitive
that is the complement of a main verb if only the infinitive is in the scope
of the negation, e.g.  (14) ""u-kút-xa mšuréle là-dwaqa míya.} ‘Everybody began (to agree) not to
       gather water.’ (A24:43)(iii) Asseveration
The negative particle may be used to express asseveration rather than
negation, especially to dispell possible doubt after questions. In such cases
the particle never bears the nuclear stress, e.g.","[927, 928, 929, 930, 931, 932, 933]"
"  (1) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} brònux-ile xíla xabúša.} ‘A: “Your brother

  (2) A: xónux hóle xíla xabùša} B: là,} xàwx5le xíla xóni.} l7le xabùša xíla.} ‘A:

      xèzy6lla.} ‘A: “My brother saw your daughter this morning.” B: “He
      did not see our daughter this morning, he saw her yesterday.” ’Examples from the text corpus:  (4) l7w6n °í°a b-xabr6 dìye.} ""áyya xá°e dìyela.} b-xábr6t xá°6 dìy6n °í°a.} ‘I did
      not come at his word. She is his sister. I came at the word of his
      sister.’ (A8:85)
  (5) ""àn6n mú°y6lle.} ‘I (and not my brother) have brought it back.’
      (A24:31)
  (6) yába ""àn6n mšúdr6lla!} ‘I (not God) have sent them!’ (A6:4)
  (7) ""àn6n xèzy6lle,} dìyile.} ‘I (and nobody else) have found it. It is mine.’
      (A14:15)
  (8) ""ànna} Sêttiyela mutt7°6lla láxxa.} ‘S6ttiye (not anybody else) put these
      here.’ (A25:36)In principle when the speaker expresses a narrow focus on one particular
argument of the clause, the proposition of the clause is presupposed to
be known to the hearer and activated in his mind with the exception of
the identity of the argument in question. In (1), for example, the clause
brònux-ile xíla xabúša} is used by the speaker when he presupposes that the
hearer knows that somebody has eaten an apple, i.e. the presuppositional
                               the syntax of verbs                          679background is ‘x has eaten an apple’. What the speaker is asserting, i.e. the
new information that he is conveying, is that x is to be identified as ‘your
son’.8 In many languages this type of argument focus can be expressed
by a cleft sentence, e.g. ‘It is your son who has eaten an apple’, in which
the assertion of the identity of the argument in focus is expressed by an
identificatory predicate and the presupposition is placed in a subordinate
relative clause. The constructions with copula movement such as brònux-
ile xíla xabúša} are not cleft sentences since the presupposition is not in a
relative clause and, moreover, the copula agrees with the subject, even if
this is the asserted argument, e.g. ""àn6n mú°y6lle} ‘I have brought it’ (= It
was me who has brought it). The attachment of the copula to the focused
argument and the placement of the nuclear stress on this argument are,
nevertheless, properties of the predicate of a copula clause. It may be
said, therefore, that the construction possesses some properties of a cleft
sentence but does not have all the components of its structure.
    Clauses exhibiting leftward movement of the copula may have two foci
of contrast, in which case the subject is given preference for the attach-
ment of the enclitic, e.g.  (9)  ""àtit °í°a kêsli.} lán ""àna-""6°ya kêsl6x.} ‘You came to me. I did not come
       to you.’ (A4:4)
  (10) yà-baxta} lan-""àna ""è°ya dmíxa gu-šwì°6x.} ""àtit °í°a dmíxta gu-šwì°i.}
       ‘Woman, I have not come to sleep in your bed. You have come to
       sleep in my bed.’ (A26:4)The presuppositional background of these constructions would have two
unknown variables, e.g. ‘x came to y’ and the speaker is asserting the
identity of both of these.
   The intention of the new information focus may be to express exclu-
sivity, e.g.  (11) har-""àtit plíxa} ‘Only you have worked.’ (A21:15)
  (12) kúlla hóla q†ìle.} bas-àn6n šrí†a.} ‘They have all been killed. Only I
       have escaped.’ (B19:8)The presuppositional background of these examples would be ‘x has
worked’ and ‘x has escaped’ respectively.","[717, 718]"

                              CHAPTER TWENTY                     REMARKS ON THE LEXICON
                     20.1. Historical ConsiderationsMany lexical items of Aramaic origin in the C. Barwar dialect have a
meaning that corresponds directly to the meaning of their cognates in
earlier forms of literary Aramaic. Several items, however, have undergone
a semantic development from the meaning that was expressed by their
literary cognates. It must be borne in mind, of course, that the NENA dia-
lects are unlikely to be direct descendants of the classical Aramaic dialects
and so some of the differences in meaning may have already existed in
proto-NENA many centuries ago. It is, nevertheless, of interest to examine
the types of semantic differences from the classical forms of the language
that are exhibited by some of the lexical items in the dialect.
    Lexical items in the dialect sometimes exhibit a meaning that is more
specific than that of their cognates in Classical Syriac. In such cases, the
basic meaning of the dialectal word is subsumed by the more general
basic meaning of the Syriac word. This often arises since another lexical
item is used in the dialect with a related meaning.
    The word ""arxe (pl. ""arxa°a) in the C. Barwar dialect, for example,
denotes specifically a ‘water-mill’, whereas the cognate in Classical Syriac
ra˙yà (pl. r˙awà∆à) refers to a ‘mill’ in general, including a hand-mill. The
reason for the narrowing of the meaning range of ""arxe in the dialect is
likely to be the existence of another lexical item that denotes specifically
a ‘hand-mill’, viz. garosta n.f. (pl. garosya°a). The semantic range of the
Syriac singular form ra˙yà, moreover, includes also the sense of ‘millstone,’
which is a component of the mill, whereas the dialectal word ""arxe refers
only to the mill as a whole. A ‘millstone’ in the dialect is expressed by
the word p6nxa.
    The noun ""6spa n.m. (pl. ""6spe) ‘loan’ is related to the Classical Syriac root
yzp ‘to borrow’. Whereas the Syriac root is used to refer to borrowing in
general, the form ""6spa is used only to denote borrowing in kind, in most
cases consumable items of food, e.g. šqílli x•††e b-""êspa} ‘I borrowed wheat’.
The act of borrowing money must be expressed by a form of the root
1030                          chapter twentydyn, e.g. mudy•nni zúze †la-Gwìrgis} I became indebted in money to Gwirgis
(= I borrowed money from Gwirgis).
   The cognate of Syriac sa'rà ‘hair’ (in general) is se‰a, but the dialectal
word is restricted in sense to ‘goat’s hair’. Other words are used to refer
to hair in general, viz. kawsa (collective), m6zze (sing. m6sta).
   According to the Syriac dictionaries the nouns 'arbàlà and me˙˙al∆à (vari-
ant ma˙˙oltà) both mean ‘sieve’. The reflexes of these words in the dialect
have a more specific meaning, in that they denote sieves with different
sizes of hole, viz. ""6rbala n.f. (pl. ""6rbale) sieve with medium sized holes and
mxilta n.f. (pl. mxilya°a) sieve with small holes (for flour).
   The adjective šammìnà in Syriac has a range of meaning including the
senses of ‘physically fat’ and ‘fertile’, e.g. 'ànà šammìnà∆à ‘fat sheep’, ""ar'à
šammìnà ‘fertile land’. In the dialect the word šamina is restricted to the
more abstract sense of ‘fertile’, e.g. "">ra šaminta ‘fertile land’. The narrow-
ing of the semantic range of the adjective in the dialect has arisen due to
the existence of another adjective †risa, which is used to express the sense
of physically fat, e.g. ""6rwe †rise ‘fat sheep’.
   The verb xll II ‘to wash’ is more restricted in usage than its Syriac
cognate ˙allel. The dialectal verb xll II is used to express the washing of
individual parts of the body (such as hands, feet etc.) and various objects
but not clothes. The Syriac verb, by contrast, is used to express also the
washing of clothes. In the dialect another verb is used to express specific-
ally the washing of clothes, viz. msy. To wash oneself by covering the
body in water, in a bath or a shower, is expressed in the dialect by the
verb xyp I.
   Several verbs in the dialect that are restricted in their usage to activities
relating to animals had a more general application in Syriac. The Syriac
verb ˙sl, for example, was used to express ‘weaning’ both of animals and
of humans, whereas the cognate dialectal form xsl is used only to denote
the weaning of animals. The weaning of humans is expressed by phrases
such as q†"" m6n-m>moße ‘to cut off from sucking’ or q†"" m6n x6lya ‘to cut off
from milk’. The Syriac verb yld ‘to give birth’ was used in relation to all
living creatures, humans and animals, including the laying of eggs. The
dialectal reflex of this yðl, however, is used only in relation to the birth of
animals and the laying of eggs. The birth of humans is expressed by forms
of the verbal bry. The verb dw‰ in the dialect is used to denote specifically
the dwelling of sheep in a rest area during the summer. This appears to
be the reflex of the verb dwr in Syriac and other literary Aramaic dialects,
which has the generic sense of ‘to dwell’.
                          remarks on the lexicon                         1031In other cases, by contrast, a dialect word has a meaning that is wider
than that of the Classical Syriac cognate and subsumes it. This has often
arisen as a result of additions or losses in related areas of the lexicon.
    The semantic range of the verb xzy in the dialect, for example, includes
both the sense of ‘to see’ and ‘to find’, whereas the cognate in Syriac ˙zy
denotes only ‘to see’. This has arisen, no doubt, due to the loss of the
Syriac verb ""eška˙ ‘to find’ in the dialect. A modern reflex of ""eška˙ can be
identified in the verb form m-‘x III, which is occasionally used by some
speakers, but this is likely to be a loan from the C. Urmi dialect, where
it is regularly used.
    The verb dry is used in the C. Barwar dialect as a general word for ‘to
put’, whereas the cognate verb in Syriac has the sense of ‘to sprinkle, scat-
ter’. It appears that the expression of the transference of location that was
a semantic component of the Syriac verb became the dominant feature
and the verb came to be used more generally without being associated
with a specific manner of action. The specific action of ‘scattering’ is now
expressed by other verbs, such as bðq or bzq. The verb sym, the cognate
of which in Syriac is a general verb ‘to put’, has come to be restricted in
the dialect to the sense of ‘to ordain (a priest)’ in stem I and to the fixed
collocation with the object bala with the sense of ‘to pay attention’ in stem
III. The verb m-ty, the irregular stem III for of ""tw, is largely restricted to
the sense of placing a stable object on a horizontal surface.","[1071, 1072, 1073, 1074, 1075, 1076, 1077, 1078]"

         8.17. General Remarks Concerning Stems II and III8.17.1. Stem II
When stem I and stem II forms exist for the same verbal root, as a general
rule the two forms differ in transitivity. There is sometimes a difference in
valence between the two forms, in that stem I takes only a subject partici-
pant whereas the stem II form has both a subject and object participant.
In some such cases the stem II form is a causative of the action expressed
by the stem I form. This applies to the following:

but it does not function as a causative. This applies, for example to the
root tlq:      tlaqa ‘to be lost’               mtaloqe ‘to lose (tr.)’The semantic role of the grammatical subject of the stem I of the verb
is the undergoer of the action, e.g. tliqli ‘I have become lost’, ‘I am lost’.
The semantic role of the grammatical subject of the stem II verb is
not that of an agent causing an action but rather an experiencer of the
action, e.g. mtulqali kisti ‘I have lost my purse’. The motivation for the use
of the stem II form, therefore, can be said to be syntactic rather than
semantic. It is motivated by the syntactic valence of the verb, in that it
takes a grammatical direct object, rather than the semantic role of the
grammatical subject.
                                     verbs                                  257   Difference in valence corresponds to the traditional concept of the
distinction between intransitive and transitive verbs. In several cases, how-
ever, stem I and stem II forms from the same verbal root have the same
valence, i.e. they both lack objects or they both take objects. These pairs
of verbal forms often seem to be semantically equivalent and to be used
interchangeably. Closer examination reveals, however, that a difference in
transitivity can in some cases be discerned between the two forms. This is
possible if we adopt the view of transitivity as a multifactorial continuum
that was proposed by Hopper and Thompson (1980). According to this
view there is no absolute dichotomy between intransitive and transitive,
but rather transitivity is a scalar phenomenon. The degree of transitivity is
determined not only by the valence of the verb but also by numerous other
parameters relating to the nature of the participants and of the activity.
Let us now examine some of the differences between stem I and stem II
verbs that have the same valence and take into account other parameters
that would be expected, according to Hopper and Thompson’s model, to
bring about differences in degrees of transitivity.
   In some cases where both the stem I and the stem II forms take objects,
the stem II form expresses an activity that is more extensive, generally
requiring greater energy, and what is affected by the activity is of a greater
extent. This applies to the following:     glaya ‘to reveal (sth. abstract)’   mgaloye ‘to uncover (sth. physical)’
     gra""a ‘to shave (one’s face)’       mg>roye ‘to strip and chop sticks’
     lmaßa ‘to suck’                     mlamoße ‘to absorb’
     pla""a ‘to divide, share’            mp>loye ‘to distribute’
     p°axa ‘to open’                     mpa°oxe ‘to open out, to spread out’
     q†a""a ‘to cut’                      mq>†oye ‘to separate stones from grains’
     šlaxa ‘to pull out (hair, plant)’   mšaloxe ‘to strip’
     šwaya ‘to spread out a bed’         mšawoye ‘to furnish (a house)’
     tnaya ‘to repeat’                   mtanoye ‘to recount (a tale)’
     †raxa ‘to flatten’ (in one act)’    m†aroxe ‘to flatten wool (by repeated
                                         combing)’The extent of the affectedness of the object is one of the parameters
that, according to the model of Hopper and Thompson, contribute to
the transitivity and so the stem II forms in this list can be regarded as
being more transitive than the stem I forms.
258                               chapter eight   Where both the stem I and the stem II form are used without direct
objects, the semantic difference between the two can in some cases be
identified as relating to the degree of control of the action by the gram-
matical subject. This applies, for example, to      xmala ‘to enjoy oneself ’          mxamole ‘to put on festive clothes’It can be said that in the activity of putting on smart clothes in order to
become festive (mxamole) the subject is the agent of the action and has
control over the action. In the event of ‘enjoying oneself ’ (xmala), on the
other hand, the grammatical subject is less of a controlling agent and
often may be simply an experiencer of the event. Agency of the gram-
matical subject and control of the action by the agent are parameters
that increase the transitivity of the verb according to the Hopper and
Thompson model.
   There are, nevertheless, several pairs of stem I and stem II forms that
do not express any identifiable difference in meaning or transitivity, e.g.      bðara ‘to scatter’                   mbaðore ‘to scatter’
      dwara ‘to thresh’                    mdawore ‘to thresh’
      graóa ‘to scratch’                   mgaroóe ‘to scratch’
      jraga ‘to snatch’                    mjaroge ‘to snatch’
      ngara ‘to tear bite from bone’       mnagore ‘to bite meat from bone’
      npaša ‘to tease (wool, cotton)’      mnapoše ‘to tease (wool, cotton)’
      pšama ‘to be sad’                    mpašome ‘to be sad, regret’
      qrawa ‘to approach’                  mqarowe ‘to approach’
      qwara ‘to bury’                      mqawore ‘to bury’
      sxaya ‘to swim’                      msaxoye ‘to swim’
      šðaya ‘to card (wool, flax)’         mšaðoye ‘to card (wool, flax)’
      šra†a ‘to escape’                    mšaro†e ‘to escape’
      ßlaxa ‘to split (wood)’              mßaloxe ‘to split (wood)’
      tlaxa ‘to destroy’                   mtaloxe ‘to destroy’It is possible that the stem II form of these pairs originally expressed
enhanced transitivity due to such features as the iterativity of the action,
e.g. npaša ‘to tease’ vs. mnapoše ‘to tease repeatedly’, šðaya ‘to card’ vs.
mšaðoye ‘to card repeatedly’, ßlaxa ‘to split’ vs. mßaloxe ‘to split repeatedly’,
the energy input of the subject, e.g. sxaya ‘to bathe’ vs. msaxoye ‘to swim’,
or the degree of affectedness of the subject, e.g. pšama ‘to be sad’ vs.

to have become blurred.
   One difference in transitivity that some of the stem I forms of this list
do exhibit from the corresponding stem II forms is that they can func-
tion as both as transitives and unaccusative intransitives. When used as a
transitive verb they take the agent as subject, whereas in their unaccusative
intransitive use the undergoer is made the subject. This semantic alterna-
tion does not exist in the stem II form, which is only transitive, e.g.     ""aw ßlixle q5sa     ‘He split the wood’      q5sa ßlixle ‘The wood
                                                  split’
     ""aw mßul6xle q5sa   ‘He split the wood’      —
     ""aw tlixle b5°a     ‘He destroyed the house’ b5°a tlixle ‘The house
                                                  collapsed’
     ""aw mtul6xle b5°a   ‘He destroyed the house’ —In the case of some stem II verbs, there is a stem I form from a homopho-
nous root that has no direct semantic connection, although in several cases
there is an etymological connection, e.g.     bnaya ‘to built’                    mbanoye ‘to prepare food’
     draya ‘to put, pour’                mdaroye ‘to winnow’

     xzada ‘to harvest’                  mxazode ‘to blame’The majority of stem II verbs have no corresponding stem I form. These
include both verbs that typically take an object complement and those
that typically are used without such a complement. The classification of
260                            chapter eightthe verbs into one of these two groups is in some cases not completely
clear-cut, since some verbs can be used with a semantic range including
both activities that require an object complement and those that do not
require one (e.g. m†ašoye ‘to hide (oneself )’ ~ ‘to hide (something)’, mdagole
‘to lie’ ~ ‘to make lie’). Furthermore some verbs take a complement in the
form of a prepositional phrase rather than a direct object. The following
two lists offer a broad division into the two categories:Verbs taking an object complement      mb>dode             ‘to poke (a fire)’

in earlier Aramaic. Three other sub-groups can be identified:(i) Intransitive verbs that correspond in meaning to verbs in the ""e∆p6'el,
""e∆pa''al or ""ettaª'al stems in Syriac rather than to verbs in the pa''el, e.g.
       mqaboye ‘to swell’, cf. Syr. Ethpe. ""e∆q6∫ì ‘to be collected (liquids)’
       mqarowe ‘to approach’, cf. Syr. Ethpa. ""e∆qarrrab ‘to approach’

     m†ašoye     ‘to hide oneself ’, cf. Syr. Ethpa. ""e††ašì ‘to hide oneself ’The p6'al stem of some of these has the same intransitive meaning, e.g.
q∫à ‘to be collected together (liquids)’, qreb ‘to approach’, †šà ‘to hide one-
self ’. It is structurally more straightforward, however, to reconstruct the
development of these stem II verbs from original ""e∆p6'el, ""e∆pa''al or ""ettaª 'al
stems. This is demonstrably the case with mtanoxe, in which the /t/ has
been preserved and has been reinterpreted as a root letter. In other forms
the /t/ element has been lost.(ii) Verbs that are derived from nouns, adjectives or particles, e.g.

The number of stem III verbs that function as the causative of a corre-
sponding stem I verb is far higher than the number of stem II verbs that
have this function. This reflects a higher degree of productivity of stem
III for this purpose. Examples of causative stem III forms include:      bnaya ‘to build’                    mabnoye ‘to have built’

the stem III causative can have an active or passive diathesis, e.g. q†ala

(§15.9.7.).
   Several stem III verbs are used intransitively without an object comple-
ment. These include the following:      m>boye           ‘to swell’

     maxšoxe         ‘to decide’
     mazloqe         ‘to shine’For a few of the intransitive stem III verbs there is a corresponding stem
I form of related but not identical meaning:     bsama ‘to be pleasing, healthy’   mabsome ‘to revel, to make merry’
     myaxa ‘to smell’ (experiencer)    mamyoxe ‘to sniff; to smell (agent)’
     nyaxa ‘to have relief, to die’    manyoxe ‘to take a rest’
     šma""a ‘to hear’                   mašmoye ‘to listen’In the examples above the stem III form does not express a causative
of stem I. The semantic distinction between the two stems is rather that
in stem III the subject is in control of the activity whereas this is not
the case in stem I. According to traditional terminology both the stem
268                              chapter eightI and stem III forms are intransitive. If, however, we adopt the concept
of transitivity in the broader sense that was proposed by Hopper and
Thompson (1980), the stem III forms can be shown to be higher in tran-
sitivity. Among the parameters identified by Hopper and Thompson that
condition high transitivity are the potency of the agent and the control
of the action by the agent. Lack of control by the agent, conversely, is a
feature of low transitivity.
   Many of the stem III forms without object complements listed above
can also be used as causatives that take an object complement, e.g.      m>boye          ‘to swell’                ‘to cause to swell’
      mabsome         ‘to make merry’           ‘to entertain’
      mabyone         ‘to appear’               ‘to cause to appear’
      magðole         ‘to freeze’               ‘to cause to freeze’
      majro†e         ‘to slip’                 ‘to cause to slip’
      majroye         ‘to leak’                 ‘to shed (e.g. tears)’
      maryoze         ‘to stand in a row’       ‘to make stand in a row’
      m>‘oze          ‘to be vexed’             ‘to vex’
      ma‘yole         ‘to sprout’               ‘to cause to sprout’

      mazloqe         ‘to shine’                ‘to cause to shine, to polish’In some cases stem I and III forms have what appear to be the same or
overlapping meaning, e.g.      ‘yala ‘to sprout’                     ma‘yole ‘to sprout’
      jra†a ‘to slip’                       majro†e ‘to slip’

     †raya ‘to ride (b- on an animal)’    ma†roye ‘to ride (an animal)’As we have seen, where the stem III form has an intransitive meaning,
it usually can also have a causative meaning. This alternative causative
meaning is, however, not available for the corresponding intransitive stem
I form. In some cases the non-causative use of the stem III form can be
shown to be higher in transitivity than the stem I form with regard to the
parameters of Hopper and Thompson, such as the extent of the action,
the degree of energy input, degree of control by the agent and degree
of affectedness of the object. The pair nsara I and mansore III ‘to saw’,
for example, are typically not used in identical contexts. The stem I form
nsara is used when one man is using a small saw whereas the stem III form
mansore is prefered when referring to the use of a large two handled saw
by two men. It can be said that the agent of mansore is more potent than
that of nsara and more energy is put into the action. In the pair †raya and
ma†roye, both of which can be rendered into English as ‘to ride’, the stem
III form, which takes a direct object, involves greater control by the agent
of the animal. A distinction in transitivity according to such parameters
is likely to have originally existed between the other pairs of verbs, but
now these have become blurred.
   Some of the stem III forms may be denominal derivations from nouns
with an initial m- affix, e.g.     maqyoße ‘to cut with scissors’       < maqaßta ‘scissors’
     maš†oxe ‘to spread out (to dry)’     < m6š†axa ‘area for spreading out
                                          fruit and vegetables to dry’In the case of several stem III forms, a stem I form with a homophonous
root exists that is unrelated in meaning, though in some cases there may
be an etymological connection, e.g.     gðala ‘to plait; wrestle’   magðole ‘to freeze’
     dyana ‘to judge’            madyone ‘to owe (money)’
     syama ‘to ordain’           masyome bala ‘pay attention’
     štaya ‘to drink’            maštoye ‘to arrange threads on warp beam’There is a small residue of transitive stem III verbs that have no cor-
responding stem I forms:
270                             chapter eight      malxome                   ‘to compose’

"19.1.2.1. Demonstrative Pronoun as Head
A nominal relative clause that contains the relative particle D in principle
must have some kind of pronominal head. The particle D itself, although
historically a pronoun in origin, no longer functions as a pronoun and
cannot act as the head of the relative clause. Nominal relative clauses
often take pronominal heads in the form of an anaphoric demonstrative
pronoun placed before the D particle. This is usually the default series of
demonstratives, though occasionally speaker deixis demonstratives are used
in this way. The anaphoric pronoun refers proleptically to the referent
described in the relative clause and is not dependent on mention in the

        done in front of you—do you know what they are?’ (A23:20)In (10) the pronominal head is combined with a partitive expression:  (10) ""o-m6nn7xu t-dàq6r} b-M9mo,} m-áxxa hál qaßr6t-mìra} t-oð•xle dêmma.}
       ‘Whoever of you touches M>mo, we shall scatter his blood from
       here until the palace of the prince.’ (A26:68)19.1.2.2. Indefinite Pronoun as Head
The cardinal particle xa may be used as an indefinite pronoun at the head
of a relative clause. In such cases it generally refers to a human referent
(‘anybody’, ‘somebody’). As is the norm with indefinite antecedents, the
construction is syndetic if the referent is non-specific (1) but asyndetic if
it has a specific referent (2)–(3):  (1)   l7le šwíqa xá t-xay•ple ""ím6t mày6°.} ‘He has not left anybody who
        would wash him when he dies.’ (D2:77)
  (2)   ""í°wa xá Pêtto-wewa š•mme.} ‘There was somebody whose name was
        P6tto’ (B19:5)
  (3)   ""í°wa xa-honàna-wewa.} ‘There was a person who was wise.’ (A14:8)In a similar manner, the quantifier raba can be used pronominally as an
indefinite head, as in (4):
966                           chapter nineteen  (4)   ""í°wa rába ""i-z>ríwala ‘èri.} ‘There were many who sowed it in
        Autumn.’ (B5:15)19.1.2.3. Quantifier kut as Head
A nominal relative may be introduced by the quantifier kut, which has
generic reference (‘whoever . . .’). This is derived historically from the phrase
*kul-xa-d < *kull-˙a≈-d ‘each one that’, which contains both the head of
the relative clause *˙a≈ ‘one’ and also the relative particle:  (1)   kùt la-pál6x} gu-d-áwwa bˆ°a} ""ixála lè y-áx6l.} ‘Whoever does not work
        in this house will not eat food.’ (A21:13)
  (2)   kút ""á°e gu-""úpra dìyi} láz6m ""áw6ð ""askarìya.} ‘Whoever comes to my

  (3)   kút ma†éwa qamáya jàld6lle} m5°èwale.} ‘Whoever was the quickest and
        reached it first would bring it back.’ (B5:154)
  (4)   kút šaqêlwale} ""aw-qrìmwale.} ‘Whoever picked it up would win.’
        (B15:33)
  (5)   kút-ile fer•ssa ""á°e ""àxxane.} ‘Whoever is a warrior, let him come here.’
        (A29:59)
  (6)   kut-b9y6t} t-yánn6x ""•lle dìye.} ‘Whoever you love, I’ll give you to him.’
        (A26:88)
  (7)   kut-m7°ela ""ána t-yánne zùze.} ‘Whoever brings her back, I’ll give
        money to him.’ (A27:30)
  (8)   ""alpá-dáwe b6d-yáw6l †la-kút ""am•rre mòdile x•lme.} ‘He will give a thou-
        sand gold pieces to whomsoever tells him what his dream is.’ (A1:12)
  (9)   ""u-sápr6t kut-á°e làxxa.} ‘Wait for whoever comes here.’ (A22:23)In (10) a nominal relative is used independently in a street call:  (10) qréli hátxa kut-záw6n tàwra?} ‘I cried out like this “(Is there) anybody
       who will buy an ox?” ’ (A22:7)19.1.2.4. Interrogative Particle as Head
A relative clause can be introduced by the interrogative particle mo/modi
‘what’. When linked to a following relative clause, this produces a nomi-
nal phrase that refers to a class of entities. In a similar type of structure,
the head of the clause may be an adverbial interrogative, such as ""5ka
‘Where?,’ which forms subordinate clauses with an adverbial function.
Relative clauses with interrogative particles as heads often have a generic
reference (‘whoever, whatever, wherever, etc.), especially when they are
placed at the beginning of the sentence.
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                        967(i) mo/modi  (1) mo-bt-amrálux bt-àwð6t.} ‘You must do what she says.’ (A8:92)
  (2) mšaróyela k°àwa} b5°wá°6t nàše} ""u-mo-t-itlèy.} ‘They start registering the
      houses of people and what they have’ (B1:16)When such relative phrases are in clause initial position, they are sometimes
resumed by a correlative element. In (3) and (4) this is the anaphoric adverbial
had6x. In (5) the correlative has the form of another interrogative pronoun:  (3) màlka} mo-t-ám6rrey t-óði hàd6x.} ‘Whatever the king tells them they
      should do.’ (A8:9)
  (4) mo-t-ámr6t wúð hàd6x.} ‘Do whatever you think best (literally: you say).’
      (A8:17)
  (5) módit snìqa} mo-t-óð6xxa †làlux.} ‘Whatever you want, (that is) what we
      shall do for you.’ (A6:9)In (1) and (5) the construction is asyndetic whereas in (2) it is syndetic.
When the verb in the relative clause is an initial / ""/ verb used in a future
sense, as in (3), (4) and the second phrase of (5), the status of the t- is
ambiguous, in that it may be interpreted either as the relative particle or
the future particle.
   Similar inclusive classes of entities can be expressed with relative phrases
introduced by the word m6ndi ‘thing’, which is often combined with the
universal quantifier ku- ‘every’. These constructions are either synthetic
or asyndetic, e.g.  (6) ""u-m•ndi-t pày6š} ""aß•rta xa-rámša xùlle.} ‘Whatever is left eat in the eve-
      ning for dinner.’ (A42:4)
  (7) kú-m6ndi-t b8y6t wùdli.} ‘Do to me whatever you want.’ (A25:14)
  (8) ku-m•ndi b8yi xoš-""òði.} ‘They may do whatever they want.’ (A14:46)
  (9) m5°íwa lêxma} yán bêsra,} yán ku-m6t-""ìle.} ‘They would bring bread or
      meat, or whatever there was.’ (B15:87)(ii) ""5ka
The attested examples of this include both synthetic constructions with
the D subordinator and also asyndetic ones without this particle, e.g.  (1) gu-d-5-dàna,} ""7k5y5wa mù†ye} p•lg6t yòma} táma y-axlíwa kùlla.} ‘At that
      time, wherever they had got to, at midday they all ate.’ (B5:62)
968                           chapter nineteen  (2) ""7ka ßà†qa} tàma z>réti.} ‘Wherever it (the dog) squats, there you should
      cultivate.’ (A30:4)
  (3) y-azíwa nablìwale} l-šaqì°a} yán l-hàmmam,} ""7k6t ""ìle.} ‘They went and
      took him to a channel or a wash house, wherever it was.’ (B15:74)A similar sense is expressed by relative clauses headed by the phrase ku-
dana ‘every time, any time’:  (4) ku-dána sànq6t,} maqðêtla,} ""ána t-á°y6n làxxa.} ‘Whenever you need (me),
      burn them and I shall come here’ (A24:49)19.1.2.5. No Head
Nominal relatives with no explicit syntactic expression of the head are
mainly found either after existential particles or in naming constructions
with the verb ""mr. In all cases the zero head has the sense of an indefinite
pronoun with a specific referent (‘some’, ‘something’) and the relative
clause is non-restrictive. In most cases the relative clause is asyndetic and
is not introduced by the particle:(i) Existential Constructions
These mainly refer to plural groups:  (1) ""í°wa zamríwa diwàne.} ‘There were some who would sing diwane.’
      (B5:11)
  (2) ""í°wa b>y7wa d5r7wa gêlla gáwa.} ‘There were some who liked to put
      herbs in it.’ (B5:167)
  (3) ""í°wa gu-""á°‰a har-šuléy ""àww5wa.} ‘There were some in the country
      whose job was (to do) this.’ (B5:168)In (4) and (5) the referent is singular:  (4) ""í° pál†a zùrta.} ""5-zúrta ""áy zadìwala.} ‘There was something (of the
      tobacco) that came out (as) small (pieces). This small stuff—they
      threw that away.’ (B7:17)
  (5) ""áw bròn-málka rába šapìr5le} ""u-hawnàn5le,} ""ína ""í° ""ax-díye ""áp-ay šapírta-
      w hawnánta brát6t málk6t ma""àrwa t-ámr6x.} ‘That son of a king is
      very good-looking and clever, but there is someone who is good-
      looking and clever like him, the daughter of the king of the West,
      let’s say (i.e. we shall give her this name for the sake of the story).’
      (A4:3)
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                        969In (6) the relative clause is syndetic, with the particle D:  (6) ""í°wa t-iw7wa ß•lye ˙abbanìyya} . . . mú°ye makày6n.} ‘There were some
      who had gone down to Óabbaniyya . . . and brought back machines.’
      (B10: 45)(ii) Naming Constructions
The name of the item in question takes the nuclear stress and is placed
either in the default position after the verb or is fronted before the verb
to give it added prominence:  (1) d5r7wa t-amr•xxa guttà°a.} ‘They put (on it) what we call “balls.” ’ (B5:39)
  (2) béna náše y-áwa mú°ye táma halbát t-amr•xxe kàde.} ‘People would have
      brought there what we call kade.’ (B5:59)
  (3) ""ánna ""íla prìsta y-amríwala ""7-ga.} ‘These things are what were called
      at that time “a spread.” ’ (B5:201)
  (4) ""í°wa hambišàye y-amr•xla.} ‘There were what we call “giants.” ’
      (A24:54)If the asyndetic relative phrase is the complement of a preposition, the
preposition remains on the noun it relates to, even when this noun is not
at the front of the phrase, e.g.  (5) kút-xa y-áwe gu-bˆ°e} ""u-heywáne y-áwa m•nne dìye,} har-gu-gòma y-amr•xxe.}
      ‘Everybody is in his home and his animals are with him, in what we
      call “the basement stable.” ’ (B5:116)
  (6) ""áw ""o-t-ítle qàmxa} nab•lle t-ámr6x l-tanùra.} ‘Somebody who has flour
      takes it to what we call the oven.’ (B5:117)When the item that is named has been mentioned previously and is definite,
it takes a demonstrative pronoun as the head of the relative phrase, e.g.  (7) qa-t-lá-ßala míya gàwe} d-ó t-ámr6x huðàla.} ‘so that the water does not go
      down into what we call a fodder stack.’ (B5:114)(iii) Other Cases
Asyndetic nominal relatives are sporadically found in other contexts, e.g.  (1) gu-má°a °éla m†éla l-be-""abòn5wa.} ‘They came to the village and went
      to what was the house of the bishop.’ (B1:17)
970                            chapter nineteen  (2) B•lb6l Hazàr} ""íle mú°y6lla lˆle ""úrza.} ‘B6lb6l Hazar—the one who
      brought her who was not a man.’ (A8:84)19.1.3. The Internal Structure of Relative Clauses
In syndetic relative clauses, which open with the particle D, the enclitic
copula is regularly attached to the particle. Ample illustration of this can
be found among the examples that are cited above. The copula is always
in its enclitic form. The emphatic copula is avoided in this syntactic con-
text (§15.3.3.). The phenomenon whereby the copula is attached to the
relative particle can be linked to the practice of moving the copula onto
prominent items in main clauses (§15.4.1.4.1., §17.1.1.2.). The item may
be a prominent focus of new information or may be topically prominent,
in that it is the central concern of the speaker. In relative clauses it is the
latter type of prominence that is involved. The referent of the antecedent
noun, represented by the D particle in the embedded clause, is the main
topical concern of the clause.
   On some occasions the copula bears the nuclear stress of the intona-
tion group, e.g.  (1) ""u-dí‰5le ß•ly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na,} ""5-""7na t-ìle ""•°ya qamáye réša.} ‘He went back
      down to the spring, the spring to which he had come previously.’
      (A26:32)
  (2) ""ó-yòm t-ìle plí†a} bróne díye mì°5le.} ‘The day that he went out, his son
      died.’ (A4:32)If the relative clause is asyndetic, on the other hand, the copula is not
placed in initial position. In the attested examples of these constructions,
the copula is normally either attached to the predicate, e.g. §19.1.1.2. ii (1,
2, 8, 9), §19.1.2.2. (2, 3), or is omitted, e.g. §19.1.1.2. ii (5). An exceptional
case is (3), in which the copula is placed at the front of the clause, as in
syndetic constructions:  (3) hadíya mtán6nnux ða-q6ßßêtta} tunì°a} ""íle š•mma dìya} tála ""u-làql6q.} ‘Now
      I shall tell a story, a story whose name is “The fox and the stork.” ’
      (A45)When a syndetic relative clause contains a verb, this is regularly placed
immediately after the relative particle D, with a subject or any other
constituent following it, e.g.
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                        971  (4)   ""7-dàn t-á°ya kyàlo,} yawíwala mêšxa.} ‘When (literally: at the time that)
        the bride came, they would give her oil.’ (B8:32)
  (5)   ""o-m6nn7xu t-dàq6r} b-M9mo} ‘whoever of you touches M>mo . . .’
        (A26:68)When the referent of a definite antecedent noun has the role of direct
object in the relative clause it is resumed by a pronominal object pronoun,
whether the clause is restrictive or non-restrictive, e.g.  (6)   ""7-brat6t malušíwala jùlle} t-oðíwala ""ax-kàlo.} ‘They made the girl whom
        they dressed in clothes like a bride.’ (B7:2)
  (7)   m•re †la-Zìne,} t-b>yéla M9mo} ‘He said to Zine, whom M>mo loved’
        (A26:64)The resumptive pronoun may be in a clause embedded within the rela-
tive clause, e.g.  (8)   ""7-baxta t-à°ya} b8y6n gawrênna} láz6m mtanyáli ða-q6ßßêtta.} ‘The woman
        who comes and I shall marry must tell me a story.’ (A36:1)In the relative clause of (9) the clause embedded under the verb b>y6t ‘you
want’ that would have contained the resumptive pronoun has been elided:  (9)   šêdla,} gu-d-a-""8ra t-b8y6t mattêtle.} ‘The sapling—you put it in the
        land that you want (to put it in).’ (B5:103)When the antecedent noun is indefinite with a non-specific referent and
the relative clause is restrictive, there is generally no resumptive pronomi-
nal direct object, e.g.  (10) hálli xá-m6ndi t-àxl6n.} ‘Give me something to eat (literally: that I
       may eat).’ (A26:57)
  (11) kú-mdit t-yáw6l †làlux} ""áp ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l trè.} ‘Everything that he
       gives to you, he will give also to your neighbour, twofold.’ (A3:4)
  (12) kú-m6ndit b9y6t,} módi m>r8d lêbbux} t-oðànne!} ‘Whatever you want,
       whatever your heart’s desire is, I shall do it!’ (A33:11)
  (13) ""áwwa kú-mdit mßaw•°wa ’ùxo,} ’ùxo,} ’ùxo.} ‘Everything that he
       spoke (= on every occasion that he spoke) (people would say) ’uxo,
       ’uxo, ’uxo.’ (A7:1)
972                            chapter nineteenWhen the interrogative pronoun mo ‘what’ functions as an indefinite pro-
noun at the head of a restrictive relative, there is likewise no resumptive
object pronoun, e.g.  (14) mo-t-ámr6t wúð hàd6x.} ‘Do whatever you say (= whatever you think
       best).’ (A8:17)When, on the other hand, an indefinite antecedent noun has a specific
referent and the following clause is non-restrictive, a pronominal object
suffix is used, e.g.  (15) q6m-xazéle xa-nàša} mì°a} naból6lle m†amòr6lle.} ‘He saw a dead person,
       whom they were taking to bury.’ (A17:1)
  (16) ""ína hóla xá-qay6m°a k°íwta tàma,} málka Šlémun k°ìw6lla.} ‘They found
       there an inscribed monument, which king Solomon had written.’
       (A14:55)
  (17) ""ítl6n xá-m6ndi b8y6x t-oð•xxe †làl6x.} ‘We have something (in mind)
       which we want to do for you.’ (A4:48)This distribution of resumptive pronominal suffixes can be interpreted
as reflecting the different syntactic status of restrictive and non-restric-
tive relative clauses. In restrictive clauses the head nominal, or at least
the relative particle D, is treated as the direct object of the verb in the
clause. Since indefinite objects in principle do not take object agreement
suffixes (§15.13.2.2.), there is no resumptive agreement suffix on the verb.
The occurrence of the pronominal suffix in non-restrictive clauses reflects
the fact that they have the status of independent clauses. Since, on the
other hand, definite direct objects in principle regularly co-occur with
pronominal agreement suffixes, this distinction in structure is not reflected
in the suffixes and the pronominal suffix occurs in both restrictive and
non-restrictive clauses.
   If the referent of the head nominal is the complement of a noun in the
relative clause, it is obligatorily represented by a resumptive pronoun, e.g.  (18) ""í°wa xa-""á©a gu-Bˆrw6r,} š•mme Raš‰d-bek.} ‘There was an agha in
       Barwar whose name was Rašid Bek.’ (B19:1)
  (19) ""áxtu kúll5xu ‘ìdetu} l-b7°6t màlka} t-íla Gozáli ""u-Nozáli gu-b6°-dìye.} ‘You
       are all invited to the house of the king, in whose house Gozali and
       Nozali are staying.’ (A8:89)
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                         973When the antecedent noun has the syntactic relation of an adverbial in
the relative clause that could be expressed without a preposition, there is
generally no pronominal resumption when the clause is restrictive. This
is the case with temporal adverbials (20–22) and the destination of verbs
of movement (23) (§14.13.):  (20) hál ""o-yóm6t mˆ°6n} har-""úrx6t ""álaha dóq6n b-ìði.} ‘Until the day I die,
       I shall always keep to God’s way.’ (A15:21)
  (21) ""7-g6t ""an-yomá°a t-awéwa ràba séra} . . . j>míwa kúlla ""ùrze,} jwànqe.} ‘On
       days when there was a lot of moonlight . . . all the men and young-
       sters gathered together.’ (B11:3)
  (22) hót m-ó-yom6 t-íx ""axni-zíle ""áti d•ry6lle gu-z6ndàna.} ‘From the day that
       we went away you have held him in prison.’ (A26:76)
  (23) ku-b7°a t-àzeti} ""áni t-yawìlux} là †arðílux.} ‘Every home that you go
       to will give you something.’ (B7:7)If the role of the head in the relative clause would be normally expressed
by a locative preposition in an independent clause, the preposition is
sometimes still omitted when the clause is restrictive. This is found where
the locative role would be expected to be expressed by the preposition
gu-, b- or m6n-, e.g.  (24) hátxa xazêxwale} ku-dùk°a t-awéwa.} ‘We would see him wherever he
       could be.’ (B9:29)
  (25) xuláßa ""aláha mut•pq6lle gu-d-a-mðíta t-íla ""5-bráta d-o-màlka.} ‘In the
       end God made him come across the town where the daughter of
       that king was.’ (A4:11)
  (26) d6-púš làxxa} gu-d-ay-šwí°a t-wewa-dmíxa xòn6x.} ‘Stay here, in the bed
       in which your brother slept.’ (A8:68)
  (27) hon-d•ry6lle gu-xa-‘ále ""amúqta lá-""am6ß ‘ù-ga ‘ú-ga pal6†.} ‘I put him in
       a deep pit from which he could never come out.’ (A22:41)In some cases, however, the preposition is used in a restrictive relative
clause with a pronominal suffix resuming the head, e.g.  (28) ""5-d7rt6 z6dyálux gáwa díya kúlla genàwela.} ‘(As for) the enclosure in
       which you threw it, they are all robbers.’ (A15:18)
  (29) m†éle gu-t8r6t ""ó-b5°a t-íla-wirta gàwe.} ‘He reached the door of the
       house in which she had entered.’ (A34:11)
974                           chapter nineteen  (30) ""ána ""ap-dìya} ""áyya ""úrxa t-ín ""ána zála bíya dìya} lè-y manš•nna hál
       yom6t-màw°a.} ‘I shall not give up until the day I die the way I am
       following now.’ (A21:35)If the clause is non-restrictive, a preposition with resumptive pronoun is
regularly used, e.g.  (31) ""í°wa xa-g•ppa gáwe díye ""àrbi hambišáye.} ‘There was a cave in which
       there were forty giants.’ (A24:54)A preposition is regularly used in all types of clauses if this is other than
the locative prepositions gu- or b-, e.g.  (32) d•ry5le ""an-b>†aníye xo°a-díya t-wewa-dmíxa Gozáli rèša.} ‘He placed
       under her the blankets that Gozali had slept on.’ (A8:69)A resumptive pronoun may be in a clause embedded within the relative
clause, e.g.  (33) q6m-qa†líle b-xa†oryà°a,} ""an-xá xa†oryá°a t-ínwa màr6llux} mási jùlle bíya.}
       ‘They killed him with washing-boards, the washing-boards which
       I was telling you they used to wash clothes with.’ (B19:9)When the head nominal has the function of locative adverbial in the rela-
tive clause, it is occasionally resumed by the adverb tama, e.g.  (34) t-lá mar>wà°5le ""o-márga} t-it-súsux d•ry6lle tàma?} ‘Is the meadow in
       which you have put your horse without owners?’ (A25:60)
  (35) wíð5le ""a-dúk°a nišànqa,} ""a-dúk°a t-wéwa ""o-dídwa wíra tàma.} ‘He made
       a sign in that place, the place where the fly had entered.’ (A11:10)When the head nominal of a relative clause is a predicate in a clause with a
1st or 2nd person subject and the referent of the head nominal is the sub-
ject of the relative clause, the verb of the relative clause is inflected in
the 1st or 2nd person, in agreement with the subject of the main clause,
e.g.  (36) ""ána ""o-xà qáša} t-ín ""•°ya gu-ˇiyàre.} ‘I am that priest who came to
       the ˇiyare.’ (B17:15)
  (37) l5t-""áti wíya xoš-náša t-it-mú°y6lla ""ánna zùze.} ‘You have not become
       a good man who has brought these coins.’ (A1:26)

Indirect polar questions (i.e., yes⎯no questions) are asyndetic with no
explicit syntactic marker, e.g.  (1) xáz6x máß6t t-amr•tli módin x•zya b-xêlmi.} ‘Let’s see whether you can tell
      me what I saw in my dream.’ (A1:7)
  (2) xàz6n} màß6n} t-óð6n xa-‘àra.} ‘I shall see whether I can find a solution.’
      (A33:6)In (3) the indirect question is negated:  (3) xáz6x lá-mß6t mam†•tla ""i°á°ux hátxa ©ðàðe?} ‘Let’s see whether you can
      (literally: cannot) bring your hands together like this.’ (A28:15)If the indirect question consists of two alternatives, these may be presented
asyndetically (4–5) or the second alternative may be introduced by the
conditional particle ""6n (6), e.g.  (4) ""o-m•ndi la-ðíle sùsa-wewa} náša-wewa l-xàße.} ‘He did not know whe-
      ther that thing was a horse or whether there was a man on its back.’
      (A29:21)
  (5) ""áwwa táwr6t wála lán-ða""a módi ""•°ya bìye,} npíl5le b-""isàra,} ""awwa
      xà-m6ndile qí°a bíye.} ‘I don’t know what has happened to that wild
      ox, whether it has fallen on a rock or whether a thing such as that
      has happened to him.’ (A12:52)
  (6) l7la ðá""a módi bràya,} hadíya p7ša kèpa} ""•n la-p7ša kèpa.} ‘She did not know
      what was happening, whether she would now turn to stone or not
      turn to stone.’ (A8:73)In (7) the conditional particle introduces a second indirect question that
is an expansion of the first rather than an alternative:  (7) l7ð6n b-x9y6n} ""6n-b-d7‰6n t-xazênn6x.} ‘I do not know whether I shall
      live, whether I shall return and see you.’ (A8:56)The alternative question may be reduced to the negative particle la (la""a).
This is introduced by lo or ""6n, resulting in the forms lo-la and ""6lla (<
""6n-la), e.g.
976                            chapter nineteen  (8)   xáz6x mhayríli lo-là""a.} ‘Let’s see whether they will help me or not.’
        (A48:2)
  (9)   ""áw l7ðe ‘ádr6t bábe díyila ""êlla.} ‘He does not know whether it is his
        father’s tent or not.’ (A28:33)19.2.2. Questions Introduced by an Interrogative Particle
Various subordinate clauses that are introduced by interrogative particles
may be classified as indirect questions. These are embedded under verbs
such as ‘to know’, ‘to see’, ‘to show’, ‘to say’ and ‘to write’, e.g.  (1)  y8ð6t ""7k6n dêry6lle?} ‘Do you know where I put him?’ (A22:44)
  (2)  lá maxzátle ""•lli ""7ka pàl6†?} ‘Won’t you show me where it comes out?’
       (A24:38)
  (3) xáze mòdila q•ßß6t.} ‘He sees what the problem is.’ (A22:43)
  (4) làn-ða""a mo-qaríwale.} ‘I do not know what they called him.’ (A12:20)
  (5) ga-l7ð6x . . . ""7nila ""ùrxa.} ‘But we do not know . . . which is the road.’
       (A26:18)
  (6) ""ína ""ána léyð6n b-7ni dána t-à°e xúwwe.} ‘But I do not know at what
       time the snake will come.’ (A24:39)
  (7) síq5le l-b5°-qòra,} gu-qawrà°a,} xáze ""7nila qáwra xà°ta.} ‘He went down
       to the cemetery and among the graves he saw which (of them)
       was a new grave.’ (A25:89)
  (8) múr ""ˆni-m6nn6n} biš-šapìrt5la.} ‘Say which of us is the most beautiful.’
       (A25:17)
  (9) xzi-k6mà t-áz6l ""áwwa táwra.} ‘See how much this ox will go for.’ (A22:1)
  (10) b8y6n t-y8ð6n ""ána ""íman mˆ°ena.} ‘I want to know when I shall die.’ (A16:1)
  (11) l7la k°ìwe} ""ím6 t-íle bênya.} ‘They have not written when it was built.’
       (B6:31)If an indirect question clause that is introduced by an interrogative particle
contains a subject nominal or independent subject pronoun, this is often
placed before the particle, e.g.  (12) ""úp ""aláha la-y8ðe ""áti ""ìman m5°éti.} ‘Even God does not know when
       you will die.’ (A16:11)
  (13) ""áw xzèle ""o-dídwa ""7ka wìrre.} ‘He saw where the fly entered.’ (A11:9)
  (14) ""u-šákr6x š•mm6t márya ""álaha xáz6x ""úrxa ""ˆk5la.} ‘We shall pray to the
       Lord God that we may find where the road is.’ (A26:17)
                    syntactic subordination of clauses                            977  (15) ""6n-lá galêtli} róxux gu-mòdila} ""u-dáx-it xyà""a} ""ána xà-yoma k•slux la-p7š6n.}
       ‘If you do not reveal to me in what your spirit lies and how you
       live, I shall not stay with you a single day longer.’ (A12:40)The subject may be raised and made the object of the main verb. This
process is reflected by the pronominal object in (16) and (17) and the
object agreement pronoun in (18):  (16) ""an-š5r°†} láz6m y>ð•tla mòdila.} ‘You should know what these condi-
       tions are.’ (A24:10)
  (17) ""7ni ""ítl5xu t-náše t-máßi mšáw°i mênna} xaz7la mà†ola?} ‘What people
       do you have who can speak with her and find out how she is?’
       (A4:13)
  (18) t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila} ""u-módi lˆla} xo-d-áwwa jùlla.} ‘He will come
       and will know what these are (Literally: what these are and are
       not) under this cloth.’ (A25:49)A constituent that does not have the role of subject is occasionally extra-
posed before the interrogative particle, e.g.  (19) yába t-áz6x xàz6x} ""5-brat7ni mà m•nna.} ‘Let’s go and see what has
       become of that daughter of ours.’ (A21:25)In (20) the embedded interrogative clause is introduced by the comple-
mentiser qa-t:  (20) xzéwali qa-t-""ó-f6lsa ""7ka npìlle.} ‘I saw where the coin fell.’ (B15:34)Interrogative particles are also used to express embedded exclamations, e.g.  (21) xzi-k6m7le lxìma!} ‘Look how fit he is!’ (A15:13)
  (22) xzi-""ánna yále k6mà š6†ránela!} ‘Look how beautiful the children are!’
       (A8:16)Some speakers have the practice of introducing new information that is
regarded as worthy of particular attention by an interrogative word, to
which the new information supplies the answer. This question and answer
structure may sometimes be blended together and put in the same into-
nation group, with the result that the whole construction is most easily
interpreted as an assertion, e.g.
978                           chapter nineteen  (23) ""áy y-ámri má dán6t plí†la qyàmta.} ‘What do they call this?—the time
       when the resurrection has come (= ‘They call this the time when
       the resurrection has come).’ (B5:54)We should mention here a few isolated cases in which the interrogative
particle ""5ni is idiomatically translated as an indefinite pronoun or a relative
particle. These appear to have arisen by a blend between an interrogative
and another construction, e.g.  (24) ""àna} kut-dax-t-íla bràti,} b8y6n ""ˆni m7°ela.} ‘Whatever has happened
       to my daughter, I want somebody to bring her back (I want—who
       will bring her back?).’ (A27:18)
  (25) škíra šêmmux,} márya ""àlaha,} ""7ni q6m-m5°éli láxxa bíyi b6-b-sùsi.} ‘May
       your name be praised, Lord God, who have brought me here
       together with my horse (who has brought me?).’ (A26:22)
                  19.3. Subordinate Content ClausesA variety of subordinate clauses that are embedded as components of
a higher clause will be brought together in this section under the broad
classification of ‘content clauses’. These function either as direct object
complements of a verb or are governed by clausal conjunctions consisting
of prepositions, adverbials and quantifiers. In a large proportion of cases
these subordinate clauses are introduced by the subordinating particle D,
though this is omitted in some circumstances. As is the case with relative
clauses, in this type of subordinate clause the enclitic copula is regularly
attached to the subordinating particle D at the front of the clause.","[1003, 1004, 1005, 1006, 1007, 1008, 1009, 1010, 1011, 1012, 1013, 1014, 1015, 1016, 1017]"
"15.13.5. The Distribution of Compound Verbal Forms with ‘Heavy’ Pronominal
Objects
As remarked above (§15.13.1.), compound verbal forms express the pro-
nominal object by L-suffixes or by pronominal suffixes attached to the
longer preposition ""6ll-. This is obligatory when the form does not have a
copula enclitic but optional when there is a copula enclitic. When an ""6ll-
phrase is used with a form that has a copula enclitic, the form is longer
than one with an L-suffix. Most examples of such ""6ll- phrases combined
with copula enclitics that are attested in the text corpus occur with 3rd
person copula elements and their position is before the copula.
                              the syntax of verbs                                  783   The ""6ll- + enclitic copula construction does not appear to be used
totally randomly. An examination of the contexts in which it occurs shows
that there is a clear tendency for it to be used at the end of a chain of
clauses. It marks the boundary of a closely knit series of actions that are
presented as a single overall event. This use of the construction to mark
an end boundary in a span of discourse probably arises from the fact that
it has a heavier morphological weight than the corresponding construction
consisting of the enclitic copula + L-suffix.
   The following examples are from narrative texts:  (1) mêxy6llux, [Cop.—L-suffix]} mêxy6llux, [Cop.—L-suffix]} mêxy6llux
      [Cop.—L-suffix]} há-t-ila múby6lle [Cop.—L-suffix] gêldux.} ""u-m5dê‰6l-

      beat you, until they made your skin swell, then they returned you.’

  (2) dèbba zìlt5la.} dèbba zìlt5la,} zílta zìlta,} xzí°5la xa-""êrba-w} ""u-mu°ˆ°6ll5la.}
      [""6ll-phrase—Cop.] ‘The bear went off. The bear went, went, went,
      saw a sheep and brought it back’. (A27:9)
  (3) hóla màra} xzí°6lle [Cop.—L-suffix] xa-bron6t-xà-malka,} láx-ða""a ""ˆka,}
      ""u-bì°6llela.} [""6ll-phrase—Cop.] ‘She says that she saw the son of a
      king—we do not know where—and fell in love with him.’ (A4:12)
  (4) qìmt5la,} šqílta xa-nerìya,} neríya gò‰a} ""u-prìmt6llela.} [""6ll-phrase—Cop.]
      ‘She got up, took a male goat, a large goat, and slaughtered it.’

      Cop.] ‘He said “What shall we do? Let’s slaughter the young one
      and eat him, (and wait) until the bear goes away from there.” ’ They
      got up and slaughtered the young one and ate it.’ (A20:7–8)
  (6) ""ám6r ""ána 'Abda-Ra˙m?n-iw6n,} p°úx t9ra!} p°ìx6llele [""6ll-phrase—Cop.]
      t8ra.} ‘He said “I am 'Abda-Ra˙màn, open the door!” and he opened
      the door.’ (A23:26)In (7) below, the ""6ll-phrase—Cop. construction p°ìxt6llela t8ra ‘She opened
the door’ is in close sequence to the preceding clause máx5 l-t9ra ‘They
knock on the door’. There then follows a chain of clauses beginning
with a Cop.—L-suffix construction repeating a reference to the opening
of the door: p°íxt6lle t9ra. The objective meaning of the two references
to the opening of the door is clearly the same. The use of the different
constructions arises from the choice of the speaker as to how to present
784                             chapter fifteenthe relationship between events. The first sequence ends with the opening
of the door. The second sequence begins with the opening of the door.  (7) ""áy hóla wáða kùbbe.} hóla ""i°á°a gu-lˆša,} lyáša kùbbe,} ""u-""ê°y5le} bába dìya}

      the vizier came, the two of them came and knocked on the door.
      They knocked on the door and, while her hands were (covered in)
      flour, she opened the door. She opened the door and saw her father
      and also the vizier who was with him.’ (A21:26)Forms with an ""6ll- phrase placed after a 1st or 2nd person copula clitic
are less frequently attested in the text corpus. They are generally used with
the same function as ‘heavy’ boundary markers. In (8) the form occurs at
the end of each of the series of discrete events that are described by the
speaker. In (9) the form, likewise, is used at the end of a series of clauses
that the speaker presents as closely-knit aspects of one overall event:  (8) ""í°wa xa-†úr6t skinyà°a.} mutt7°6twa qámi xa-†úr6t skinyà°a.} ""áw pìð6n-

      shall buy it if it has two legs.” I cut off another one.’ (A22:9)15.13.6. Object Marker on the Direct Object Nominal
On some sporadic occasions the direct object nominal has prefixed to it
the preposition qa-, †la- or l-, which are normally used before nouns to
express a dative relation. In the available examples, the preposition qa-
is used before definite objects without an agreement pronoun on the
verb, e.g.
                           the syntax of verbs                           785  (1)   ßlí°5la bàxta} xzí°a qa-màlla.} ‘The woman went down and saw the

  (2)   T>tár-i Slemán-i Sèndi q†íl5le qa-Z?l.} ‘T>tar-i Sleman-i S6ndi killed

  (4)   b>yéwa qa-""alàha.} ‘He loved God.’ (A16:10)
  (5)   dwíq5le qa-""àrya} ""u-mù°y6lle.} ‘He caught the lion and brought it

  (6)   maláxa m5‰èšle qa-ràbb6n.} ‘The angel woke the monk.’ (A15:11)
  (7)   dáx bárya b-sˆrw6n} qa-xálwa xwàra?} ‘How could it happen that I
        reject the white milk (of my mother)?’
  (8)   m8x6b qa-bábux ""u-yêmmux!} ‘Love your father and mother!’The preposition †la-/ta- is attested before definite direct objects and is in
some cases accompanied by an agreement pronoun on the verb, e.g.  (9)  taxránne †la-xlúl6t xóni Šêmmo.} ‘I remember the wedding of Š6mmo
       my brother.’ (B8:21)
  (10) ""6n-""ána hawènwa q†íl6lla "">yáha ""aqêrwa,} ""áwwa xúwwe t-awéwa q†íla
       †la-bròni.} ‘If I had killed that scorpion, that snake would have
       killed my son.’ (A9:6)
  (11) ""áwwa q†ìlle †la-""árya.} ‘He killed the lion.’ (A11:1)
  (12) zìpt6llela} †la-M9mo.} ‘She pushed M>mo.’ (A26:3)
  (13) díya ""áwwa b8ye ta-d-áyya bráta zùrta.} ‘Now he loves this young girl.’
       (A14:83)
  (14) zarqèxwa †la-mèzze max-ßoßì°a.} ‘We used to weave the hairs like a
       plait.’The preposition l- is rarely used as a direct object marker on a nominal.
An isolated example in the text corpus is (15):  (15) ˙átta l-""umràne-≥ig6n} tlìx6lla.} ‘He destroyed even the churches.’
       (B2:2)15.13.7. Double Objects
The verbs ""wð ‘to do, to make’, á¬y ‘to fill’, dwq ‘to fill, pack’ and certain
causative verbs may take two direct objects, e.g.
786                           chapter fifteen  (1)  y-oðíwale pùwuš.} j>míwale y-oðíwale qàpla.} ‘They made it into hay.
       They gathered it and made it into an armful.’ (B5:84)
  (2) y-oðále zeðàye.} . . . y-oðále guttá°a qamàye.} ‘She makes it into pitta
       breads. . . . First she makes into balls.’ (B5:101)
  (3) y-oðèxwale q6††á†e q6††à†e.} ‘We made it into pieces.’ (B5:139)
  (4) ""u-áá¬6xxa ‘ántux zùze.} ‘We shall fill your bag with money.’
       (A39:14)
  (5) ‘ánte díye dwíqla zwàðe.} ‘She packed his bag with provisions.’
       (A21:22)
  (6) malw6šíwale jull-dìye} ‘They would dress him in his clothes.’
       (B5:26)
  (7) max6ðríla ""a-k yàlo.} ‘They caused the bride to go around (the village).’
       (B5:38)
  (8) madoqíla xètna-w k yálo gota-©ðàðe.} ‘They make the groom and bride
       hold each other’s side.’ (B5:50)
  (9) ""èdyo maštènn5xu št7°a dìy6n} t-in-wíð6lla ""àna.} ‘Today I shall give you
       our drink to drink, which I have made.’ (B15:57)
  (10) hátxa m>l6pètli ˙aqqú°a ""u-na-˙aqqù°a.} ‘You should teach me what is
       lawful and what is unlawful.’ (A15:10)
                         15.14. Indirect ObjectsA nominal that has the function of the indirect object of an action, i.e.
one that refers to a participant who is a recipient or beneficiary in the
action, is expressed by attaching the preposition †la-/ta- or qa-. Unlike
direct object nominals, indirect object nominals normally do not have
any agreement element in the form of a pronominal copy on the verb,
even when the noun is definite, e.g.  (1)   ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l têrte tawriyá°a.} ‘He will give to your neighbour
        two cows.’ (A3:4)
  (2)   tèmm6l t-ámr6n ta-bàbi.} ‘Tomorrow I shall tell my father.’ (A18:7)
  (3)   mèrt5la †la-d-áw-naša sáwa puš-b-šˆna!} ‘She said to that old man
        “Remain in peace!” ’ (A8:69)On some rare occasions an agreement L-suffix is attested on the verb,
e.g.  (4)   ""ána t-àz6n} tanyánne ða-tuní°a †la-màlka.} ‘I shall go and tell a story
        to the king.’ (A36:2)
                             the syntax of verbs                                787As already described in §8.19.5., a pronominal indirect object of a verb
may be expressed by an L-suffix or by an independent prepositional phrase
consisting of the prepositions ""6ll-, †la- or qa- and a pronominal suffix. With
past base verbs the pronominal indirect object may also be expressed by
the inflection of the past base, e.g. mirále ‘He said to her’. Here we shall
examine in greater detail the distribution of these alternative devices in
the text corpus.
   When there is no direct object, the pronominal indirect object may
usually be expressed either by an L-suffix or by an independent preposi-
tional phrase. In such cases the ‘heavier’ prepositional phrase tends to be
used at the end of an intonation group (7–9) and avoided in the middle
of an intonation group following the verb (5–6). Included here are verbs
of saying followed by direct or indirect speech:  (5)   ""álaha yállux b-àyya dúnye} ""u-b-5-xèta.} ‘May God grant you (bounty)
        in this world and the next.’ (A21:44)
  (6)   xáli lá ""amrètli qèßß6t d-áwwa qáßra mòdila?} ‘Uncle, will you not tell
        me what the story of this palace is?’ (A25:67)
  (7)   ""ám6r ""èlle dìye.} ‘He says to him.’ (A21:2)
  (8)   t-ámreti †làli.} ‘Tell me.’ (A21:43)
  (9)   ""ána mar6n-êllux.} ‘I say to you.’ (A17:34)A compound verbal form consisting of a resultative participle or an
infinitive without a clitic copula never takes L-suffixes. It usually takes a
cliticized ""6ll-phrase, e.g. hon híw6lle ‘I have given to him’, hon yaw6lle ‘I am
giving to him’. At the end of an intonation group this may be replaced
by an independent prepositional phrase with its own stress, e.g.  (10) hóle mára †làli.} ‘He says to me.’ (A17:10)
  (11) ""áyya ""íla yíwta qa-dìyi.} ‘She has been given to me.’ (A25:39)When the verb has both a pronominal direct object and a pronominal
indirect object, the direct object is normally the primary object affix on
the verb and the indirect object is expressed by a prepositional adjunct
phrase, which in most cases follows the direct object affix, e.g.  (12) xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa} ""u-t-yáxla ""èlle dìye.} ‘Let’s look for a
       man who is a hard worker and give her to him.’ (A21:3)
  (13) ""ána t-yànna-llux.} ‘I shall give them to you.’ (A12:2)
788                            chapter fifteen  (14) á¬óla sámma-w hallùle-lle.} ‘Fill it with poison and give it to him.’
       (A26:86)

  (18) ""ána t-amrênna-llux.} ‘I shall tell it to you.’ (A21:35)When the verb has a definite direct object nominal, this generally takes
an agreement in the form of a direct object pronominal affix and a pro-
nominal indirect object must be expressed by an independent prepositional
phrase, which generally follows, e.g.  (19) bas-yátla Náze ""êlli.} ‘But you must give Naze to me.’ (A25:23)
  (20) qá-mo le-yátla xá°ux ""êlle?} ‘Why won’t you give your sister to him?’
       (A26:72)
  (21) ""ána sámi t-yánne †lalˆxu.} ‘I shall give my portion to you.’ (A21:29)
  (22) t8ra la-pa°xètle ""èlle dìye.} ‘Do not open the door to him.’ (A23:25)
  (23) ""áwwa yála yíw6lle ""álaha ""èlla díya ""6štà yárxe.} ‘God gave them this
       child six months ago.’ (A15:9)In (24) there is a deviation from this usual rule, in that the indirect pro-
nominal object is expressed by an L-suffix on the verb before the L-suffix
that agrees with the direct object nominal:  (24) hállila masr6q°ònti} ‘Give me my little comb’ (A34:3)Occasionally a textually prominent indefinite direct object nominal takes
an agreement pronoun, e.g.  (25) ""áp-""awwa šaqèlla ðá-k6sta qa-d-ày,} yawèlla qa-d-ày.} ‘He also takes a
       purse for her and gives it to her.’ (A4:22)When a direct object nominal has no object agreement on the verb, the
pronominal indirect object is the primary affix on the verb, which is an
L-suffix in verb forms that take L-suffixes. The main circumstances in which
the direct object agreement element is omitted include the following:

       also shall go down and sleep at home. You will be obliged to give
       me my sustenance.’ (A10:3)(iii) A definite nominal that is a narrow focus
Agreement with a definite direct object is omitted on the verb if the object
constitutes a narrow focus which does not include the verb. The focus may
be a new information focus, in which case the verb is in the presupposition
of the clause, or the focus may be one of prominence, in which case the
verb may be new information but is of reduced prominence, e.g.  (33) har-t-yàtli ða-bráta,} là?} mère hè.} mère yátli S6ttìye.} mère ma-yxàl6f,} t-yán-
       nux S6ttìye.} ‘ “You will still give me a daughter, is that not so?’ ” He
       said “Yes.” He said “You should give me S6ttiye (rather than one of
       the others).” He said “Fine. I’ll give you S6ttiye.” ’ (A25:25)
  (34) ""aláha hóle yíw6lli ""áyya ""ùrxa.} ‘God has given me this way.’ (A21:42)Even when there is no direct object agreement suffix on the verb, the
indirect object can be expressed by an independent prepositional phrase.
This is found at the close of an intonation group to act as end-weight-
ing, e.g.  (35) hátta m5xólta b-kàwe dár6x ""6lle-díye.} ‘We even give food to it through
       the window.’ (A12:62)
790                            chapter fifteenIt is also found where the speaker fronts the phrase to give the indirect
object prominence in order to set it in contrastive opposition to an indirect
object in an adjacent clause, e.g.  (36) ""6n-†lálux yáw6l xà xmára} ta-šwáwux t-yáw6l trè xmáre.} ‘If he gives to
       you one ass, he will give to your neighbour two asses.’ (A3:4)
  (37) ""u-†lálux lan-šwíqa ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘I have left nothing for you (whereas I
       have taken everything for myself ).’ (A2:11)At the end of a discourse unit the long alternative type of suffix con-
struction for the expression of an indirect object is occasionally used on
compound verbal forms, whereby the copula element is placed after the
pronominal suffix. For the use of this construction with direct object suf-
fixes for end-weighting see §15.13.5.:  (38) ""6n-mjuwêbla,} xo-""àn6n ""è°ya kêsl6x.} ""6n-là mjuwèbla,} ""àtit °í°a kêsli.}
       qrí°5la qála b-Šál6m ""u-Sùrma,} ‘u-jwába la-yìw6ll5la.} [< yiwa + 6lla
       (3fs. indirect object) + ila (3pl. copula)] ‘ “If they answer you, then
       indeed it is me who has come to you. If they do not answer you,
       you have come to me.” She called Šalem and Surma, but they
       did not give her any reply.’ (A26:4–5)If a past base verb is used in the clause, an indirect pronominal object
tends to be expressed by an independent prepositional phrase in all cir-
cumstances, e.g.  (39) yíwla xa-q7sa xéna ""èlle dìye.} ‘She gave another stick to him.’
       (A22:29)
  (40) ""ím6t ""aláha yíwle ""6lléy bròna} ‘When God gave them a son . . .’
       (A15:17)
  (41) mêre ""èlle díye} ‘He said to him’ (A17:4)
  (42) mère †làli} ‘He said to me’ (A22:8)
  (43) hàtxa mjuwèble ""èlli málka.} ‘The king replied to me thus.’ (A17:34)
  (44) wídla f†árta ""êlli.} ‘She made breakfast for me.’ (A21:35)

"14.5.2. Suffixes on the Independent Genitive Particle
The pronominal suffixes of a noun may be suffixed directly to it or by the
mediation of the independent genitive particle diy-. The genitive particle
is placed after the noun in an annexation relationship, the initial d- being
in origin the annexation particle:     3rd pers.      ms.         b7°a díye ~ b7°e díye       ‘his house’
                    fs.         b7°a díya                   ‘her house’
                    pl.         b7°a diyéy                  ‘their house’
     2nd pers.      ms.         b7°a díyux                  ‘your (ms.) house’
                    fs.         b7°a díy6x                  ‘your (fs.) house’
                    pl.         b7°a diy7xu                 ‘your (pl.) house’
     1st pers.      s.          b7°a díyi                   ‘my house’
                    pl.         b7°a díy6n ~ b5°a diy7ni    ‘our house’
498                           chapter fourteenNote that when the 3ms. form of the genitive particle is combined with
a noun, the 3ms. suffix (-e) may optionally be attached also to the noun,
which, in fact, is the more frequent construction.
   The annexation between the head noun and the particle may undergo
various degrees of contraction. The final inflectional vowel of the noun
is sometimes reduced to the central vowel /6/, e.g. "">rá°6 díye ‘his lands’
(B5:73), m-zorú°6 dìy6n ‘from our childhood’ (B3:10), t6xrúny6 dìy6n ‘(according
to) our memory’ (B3:10). On several occasions the inflectional ending of
the head noun is completely elided, e.g. brōn-díye ‘his son’ (A14:36), brōn-díya
‘her son’ (A14:5), b6°-dìye ‘his house’ (B5:18), šùl dìya ‘its job’ (B5:90), ""8°6r
dìy6n ‘our country’ (A14:91), nāš-dìy6n ‘our people’ (B15:9), taqān-díye ‘its
branches’ (B5:206), x6zmān-dìye ‘his relatives’ (B5:60).
   The distribution of the independent genitive partice and the motiva-
tion for its use differs according to the suffix. When the pronominal suffix
is 3ms. or 3fs., the genitive particle construction is the norm. This is no
doubt a device to disambiguate the pronominal suffixes -e (3ms.) and -a
(3fs.) from the simple nominal inflectional endings. Examples: qále díye
‘his voice’ (A25:43), kosí°a díya ‘her hat’ (A25:83), júlle díye ‘his clothes’
(A25:33). When two nouns are conjoined in a tightly-knit phrase, one
genitive particle may serve for the phrase as a whole, e.g. bábe yèmme díye
‘his mother and father’ (A25:11).
   The genitive particle is occasionally omitted after 3ms. and 3fs. suffixes.
This occurs in principle where the interpretation of the suffix is highly
predictable from the context and it has low information value. A typical
context for this omission is where the suffixes are attached to words refer-
ring to body parts or implements and they refer unambiguously to the
subject of the clause or a topical referent in the discourse, e.g.  (1) mèxy6lla ""íðe hátxa gu-nar†óm6 sùsa.} ‘He put his hand like this on the
      snout of the horse.’ (A12:65)
  (2) ""áw6ð ""íðe xo-d-ò képa.} ‘He put his hand under the stone.’ (A12:30)
  (3) ßléla dèmme r6š-pà°e.} ‘Blood flowed down onto his face.’ (A24:40)
  (4) ""áwwa náša lèbbe pqìle.} ‘This man—his heard burst.’ (A31:2)
  (5) ""7ne p°ìxt5la.} ‘His eye is open.’ (A31:6)
  (6) šqílt6lla kosí°a díya hátxa m-rèša.} ‘She took off her hat from her head.’
      (A25:82)
  (7) ""áwwa mèxy5le s7pe l-qðál6 d-o-súsa.} ‘He drove his sword into the neck
      of the horse.’ (A12:61)
  (8) ""o-yála zóra žàre} šqíla ""aw-n9re mènne díye.} ‘The poor young boy took
      that axe of his with him.’ (A14:12)
                           the syntax of nominals                             499When the reference of the suffix on a direct object is different from that
of the subject, there is a greater tendency for the ‘heavier’ construction
with the genitive particle to be used, e.g.  (9) ""ína ""árya ""íðe díye q6m-axêlla.} ‘The lion ate his hand.’ (A11:1)The particle is sometimes omitted before other types of inanimate inalien-
able possessions, e.g.  (10) de-qíma mtúny6lla q6ßßètte kúlla †la-d-o-sàwa.} ‘He told all his story to
       the old man.’ (A14:76)
  (11) mtagbèrwala g yān-díye xayù°e.} ‘He would support his life himself.’
       (B5:74)Animate inalienable possessions such as family relations in general take the
genitive particle, e.g. bábe díye ‘his father’ (A32:31), yèmme dìye ‘his mother’
(A14:5), xóne díye ‘his brother’ (A25:1), xále díye ‘his uncle’ (A25:45), bába
dìya ‘her father’ (A14:1), bróna dìya ‘her son’ (A14:4).
   The genitive particle is sometimes omitted after a 3rd person singu-
lar suffix when the nominal phrase as a whole has reduced information
value due to its status in the discourse. This is exemplified in (12). Here
‘his dream’ in the initial announcement ‘Anybody who knows . . . what he
saw in his dream . . .’ has the gentive particle (x6lme diye), but later in the
discourse, where this announcement is repeated and does not convey new
information, the narrator uses the ‘lighter’ form without the particle to
express the same (x6lme):  (12) ""áwwa málka xzéle xa-xêlma.} . . . kút y8ðe . . . mòdile xèzya b-xèlme díye}
       b-yawèlle ""êmma dáwe.} . . . ""o-xúwwe mêre} hà-naša} lˆk6t zála?} mère
       b-álaha hon-zála k6s-màlka.} málka hóle xèzya xa-xêlma.} màra} kút-y>ðe
       mòdile xèzya b-xèlme w-amêrre} b6d-šáq6l ""álpa dàwe.} ‘This king had
       a dream. . . . Anybody who knows . . . what he saw in his dream, he
       will give him a hundred gold coins. . . . The snake said “Hey, man,
       where are you going?” He said “By God, I am going to the king.
       The king has had a dream and says that anybody who knows
       what he saw in his dream and tells him will have a thousand gold
       pieces.”’ (A1:2–5)Conversely, when a noun with a suffix is repeated in a clause that expresses
climax (13) or one that reiterates a fact to express its importance (14–15),
500                          chapter fourteenthe genitive particle sometimes occurs in the second, more prominent,
clause but not in the first:  (13) q6m-maxéla ""áqla biš-x5làna,} q6m-parèla ""áqla dìya.} ‘He struck her leg
       harder and burst her leg.’ (A33:12)
  (14) ""ó K>r‰m,} bábe mìtle.} bábe díye mìtle.} ‘Now, the father of Karim died.
       His father died.’ (A14:4)
  (15) dwíq6lle, nšíq6lle, mútt6lle šòpe.} mútt6lle šópe dìye.} ‘He held him,
       kissed him and put him in his place. He put him in his place.’
       (A25:51)The genitive particle with pronouns other than the 3ms. and 3fs. have a
different distribution.
    The particle is often used when the head noun is an unadapted loan-
word, e.g. b8lam diyéy ‘their boat’ (A14:39), ˙àÄÄ díyi ‘my luck’ (A1:4),
quwāt-díy6n ‘our forces’ (A14:53), qêßß6t díyux ‘your story’ (A14:33). They
are also generally used after a proper name, e.g. Fárxo diyˆxu ‘your Farxo’
(A25:21), be-H7do diyˆni ‘our family of H5do’ (B8:1).
    On common nouns with nominal inflectional endings, however, the
suffixes of the 1st and 2nd person and 3pl. tend to be attached directly
without the mediation of the genitive particle. Some cases are, nevertheless,
found where the genitive particle is used with these suffixes. This mostly
occurs when the speaker wishes to give some kind of prominence to the
suffix. In this group of suffixes it is the 1pl. suffix that is expressed by the
genitive particle with the greatest frequency. In most cases where the par-
ticle is used for the 1pl. suffix, the speaker is referring to a referent that
belongs to his community but not to that of the hearer, i.e. the 1pl. suffix
is ‘exclusive’. The exclusive interpretation arises from the prominence that
the heavy coding of the construction gives to the suffix, which is contrastive
in nature (‘ours not yours’). This can be compared to the exclusive 1pl.
function of the long suffix -5ni described above (§14.5.1.). The construc-
tion with the genitive particle is frequently used with the nouns denoting
the location of the speaker’s community, such as ma°a ‘village’ and ""a°‰a
‘country’, its people, institutions or aspects of its life, e.g.  (16) ""í°wal6n šawwá ""abòne} gu-má°a dìy6n.} ‘We had seven bishops in our
       village.’ (B2:6)
  (17) klá klá làxxa!} ""áwwa ""8°6‰ dìy6n-ile.} ‘Stop, stop here! This is our
       land.’ (A14:91)

  (23) ""u-rába pšì††5wa xayú°a díy6n gu-ma°wá°a.} ‘Our life in the villages
       was very simple.’ (B15:12)In some cases the genitive particle has the long form of the 1pl. suffix,
e.g.  (24) ""ànn5la ""eð>wá°6 diy7ni.} ‘These are our festivals.’ (B6:16)
  (25) náše diyˆni} ""i-ß7mi †¬á yomàne.} ‘Our people fast for three days.’
       (B6:21)The 1pl. suffix is given additional prominence in (26) by expressing it as
an independent phrase with a demonstrative head (""o-diy6n ‘our one’) and
placing this in apposition to the noun:  (26) máx gèšr6 Zàwa d-o-dìy6n} ‘like the bridge over our Zab’ (A30:51)The genitive particle with a 1s. suffix is rarely attested in the text corpus.
In (27) it is clearly a contrastive focus:  (27) ""u-qále díye rába basìm5wa.} mút qála dìyi?} ‘His voice is very beautiful.
       What is my voice (in comparison)?’ (A25:43–44)In some cases the speaker appears to be giving prominence to the intrinsi-
cally exclusive nature of the 1s. reference, e.g.  (28) b8y6n xáðr6n gu-""úpra díyi xazênne.} ‘I (the king) want to go around
       my own land to see it.’ (A14:47)

        made to myself, not to anybody else).” ’ (A8:78–79)Likewise 2nd person suffixes are rarely expressed by the genitive particle.
The cases that are attested in the text corpus can be interpreted as having
the purpose of giving the suffix some kind of prominence. In (30)–(32) the
exclusivity of the 2nd person reference is given distinctness. In (30) and
(31) this is the exclusivity of a family or community. In (32) it connotes
the sense of uniqueness to the head noun:  (30) x6zmayú°a ""íla manáy ""6n-xá náša dìyux} yan-xá bráta díyux hot-híw6lla

       nobody with that figure of yours (i.e. it is unique to you). That is

relation that is contrary to expectation:  (33) ""áwwa rèši} t-á°e xá-yoma pràma} b6d-""i°á°a dìyux.} ""àti parmètle réši.} ‘This
       head of mine will one day be cut off by your own hands. You will
       cut off my head.’ (A14: 35)The genitive particle may be used independently of a head noun. If it
functions as an ascriptive predicate that assigns a property to the subject
of the clause, it requires no pronominal head, e.g.
                          the syntax of nominals                             503  (34) ""ánna ""álpa-w xamšá-mma dìyuxila} ""ánna ""álpa-w xamšá-mma dìyila.}
       ‘These one thousand five-hundred are yours and these one thou-
       sand five-hundred are mine.’ (A1:20)
  (35) ""áp ""anna-júlle t-ilà-llux} ""u-""áyya xmárta dìyila.} ‘Also the clothes that
       are on you and this donkey are mine.’ (A6:12)
  (36) ""áwwa b7°a dìy6xile bráti?} ‘Is this house yours, my daughter?’
       (A40:13)
  (37) b6xyóna l7le dìyux.} ‘Crying is not for you.’ (A38:7)In other contexts the genitive particle without a head noun requires a
pronominal head in the form of a demonstrative pronoun. This pronoun
is anaphoric and functions like the anaphoric pronoun at the head of a
relative clause (see §14.3.2.), in that it binds the reference to the descrip-
tion in the following modifier phrase, e.g.  (38) ""an-díy6n tíwla tàma.} ‘Those (people) of ours settled there.’ (B8:5)
  (39) ""ánna dìy6n} wídla tàgbir.} ‘These (people) of ours made a plan.’
       (B19:5)
  (40) rába xá-mdi prìš5la júllux gu-d-ánna diy7ni.} ‘Your clothes are something
       special compared to ours.’ (A35:10)
  (41) b-àlaha} ""ána har-""a-díyi zála xìšta.} ‘By God, that (fate) of mine has
       gone (= I’m doomed).’ (A14:29)We should include in this section the idiomatic phrases relating to family
relations exemplified in (42)–(44):  (42) bábe díye ""u-d-áni ""ê°yela.} ‘His father and his father’s family came.’
       (A4:55)
  (43) txírre b7°6t bábe ""u-d-àni.} ‘He remembered the house of his father
       and his family.’ (A14:87)
  (44) ""7-ga b-l7le tíw6x k6s-xáli d-àni.} ‘That night we sat with my uncle
       and his family.’ (B15:57)Since the phrase ""u-d-ani in this construction does not have a pronominal
head, it must be construed as a modifier of the head noun babe (diye) ‘his
father’, co-ordinated with the suffix modifier of the noun ‘his’, rather than
a head coordinated with the head ‘his father’. The meaning, therefore,
is ‘the father of him and of them’, i.e. his father and the family of his
father. The head noun may take other suffixes, e.g. babi ""u-d-ani ‘my father
and my father’s family’.

clause, it is generally expressed by attaching a pronominal suffix to the
noun gana. This is a noun of Kurdish origin meaning ‘soul, life, body’. It
still retains its original meaning in some contexts, e.g.  (1) ""6n-lá-""awð6t b-xábra dìyi} gánux šaqlênna.} ‘If you do not do as I tell
      you, I shall take away your life.’ (A15:20)
  (2) y-a°7wa m-bár hàd6x} xámša ""6štà ganá°a.} ‘Afterwards, five or six people
      would come.’ (B5:77)
  (3) ""ína xa-senìye} dáwa xaße-díye xá-xuwwe zòra,} réš6t nàša} ""u-gán6t xùwwe}
      ‘He saw a gold tray on which there was a small snake with the
      head of a man and the body of a snake.’ (A14:31)It is used as a respectful address, e.g.  (4) ha-gàni,} lˆk6t zála?} ‘Hey, my dear, where are you going?’ (A15:6)
  (5) háyyo ya-gáni t-amrànnux.} ‘Come, my dear, let me tell you something.’
      (A22:36)It is used with the function of a reflexive pronoun in the following con-
texts:(i) Direct object
    (6) zdí°6lla gána dìya} k6sle-dìye.} ‘She threw herself down beside him.’
         (A37:18)

         self and threw himself there.’ (A38:15)
    (8) mtugb6ràli gáni.} ‘I have looked after myself.’ (A1:11)
    (9) mrázg6t gànux.} ‘Prepare yourself.’ (A6:4)
    (10) gáw‰i °éle m†áši gànux!} ‘My husband has come, hide yourself !’
         (A22:29)

         himself (literally: from himself ) to save his life.’ (A39:6)(iii) Complement of a noun in annexation
    (19) maxbán6t gàne-wewa.} ‘He was a lover of himself (= selfish).’
         (A3:1)
    (20) ""5–dán6 t-ìla ‰íše,} kút-xa gu-šwí°6t gàne} . . . ‘When they woke up, each
         one in his own bed . . .’ (A4:5)
    (21) šqílle d>bánj6 gáne dìye.} ‘He took his pistol.’ (A27:2)When the pronominal suffix is 1pl., the effect of using the reflexive pro-
noun is to express exclusivity (‘ours not yours’):  (22) gu-""á°‰6t g yàn6n} ràb6xwa xèðye pßíxe.} ‘In our own land we were very
       happy and cheerful.’ (B16:6)
  (23) ""í°wal6n ""urxá°6t g yàn6n.} ‘We used to have our own (customary) ways.’
       (B5:1)(iv) Apposition
   (24) ""ítli gáni š7ra hon-wìð6lle} ‘I have myself a poem that I composed.’
        (B1:14)In some of these syntactic positions a reflexive pronoun that is corefer-
ential with the subject may also be expressed by a pronominal suffix or
demonstrative pronoun. This applies to reflexive pronouns that express
the beneficiary of the action, which may be expressed by L-suffixes or
prepositional phrases without gan-, e.g.
506                            chapter fourteen  (25) q7m6n šaqlènni xákma mêndi mènni b-""ìði.} ‘I shall get up and take for
       myself a few things, with me in my hand.’ (A23:5)
  (26) b>yánni ""èmma bnà°a.} ‘I want for myself a hundred girls.’
       (A25:74)
  (27) si-bnílux dúk°6t tré-g6ld6t tàwre.} ‘Go and build for yourself in a place
       (the size of) two ox skins.’ (A11:11)
  (28) dwíqle ""àskar ""èlle díye.} ‘He recruited an army for himself.’
       (A11:15)
  (29) y-á°e mzabènwa †la-d-àw-u yèmme díye.} ‘Then he would come back
       and sell them for himself and his mother.’ (A14:10)
  (30) †la-d-áy dráy5la xà‘‘a} †la-d-áw ràba.} ‘For herself she pours out a
       little and for him a lot.’ (A17:25)Also reflexive possessive pronouns are frequently expressed by pronominal
suffixes, e.g.  (31) ""ay-lwíšt6lla júlla dìya.} ‘She put on her clothes.’ (A14:91)
  (32) mèxy6lla ""íðe hátxa gu-nar†óm6 sùsa.} ‘He put his hand like this on the
       snout of the horse.’ (A12:65)An L-suffix expressing a direct object is used with a reflexive sense when
the preceding clause has a gan- phrase in direct object position, e.g.  (33) xá-pa‰a ""awèdla gáne ""ax-qêšta,} maxéla bēn-S6ttíye l-Fàrxo.} ‘One lamb
       made itself like a bow and pushed itself between S6ttiye and Farxo’
       (A25:29)The phrase b-gan- + suffix ‘by oneself ’ denotes the agency of an action.
If the sense of ‘by oneself ’ is locative isolation rather than agency, the
particle of isolation xoð- is used. This is optionally preceded by the prepo-
sitions l- or b-, e.g.  (34) lí° ""áp-xa gu-bˆ°a?} mèra là} har-""àna,} xòðiw6n.} ‘He said “There is
       nobody in the house?” She said “No, only me. I am alone.”
       (A22:32)
  (35) pìšela} har-""àni-tre l-xoðéy.} ‘Only those two remained by themselves.’
       (A20:9)
  (36) xá-naša l-xóðe lítle la-bába la-yèmma la-""àp-xa,} ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.} ‘A
       man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or anybody,
       they say that he has no relatives.’ (A17:17)

       by themselves, cows and oxen, they were all by themselves.’
       (B10:55)Occasionally the pronoun of isolation is combined with the cardinal
numeral xa, e.g.  (38) ""áw xa-l-xóðe díye t>màha.} ‘He is all alone there.’ (A27:5)The reciprocal pronoun ġðaðe is used in the following syntactic contexts:(i) Direct object
    (39) bróni ""u-brátux xèzyela ġðàðe.} ‘My son and your daughter saw each
         other.’ (A4:26)
    (40) muxèbla ġðàðe.} ‘They loved (i.e. fell in love with) each other.’
         (A4:4)
    (41) ""u-""è°yela xpíqe ġðàðe,} nšáqa ġðàðe.} ‘They came and hugged each
         other, kissing each other.’ (A4:55)(ii) Complement of a preposition

    (44) x8yi m-ġðàðe} †¬á°i šênne-u} m7°i m-ġðàðe.} ‘They will live together
         thirty years and die together.’ (A4:46)
    (45) xá-bena ""an-tre-maláxe t-w7wa ""è°ye bìya,} t-w7wa mutèpq6lla b-ġðàðe,}
         °éla pyáða táma tàma.} ‘Then, those two angels who had brought
         her, who had caused them to meet each other, came passing by.’
         (A4:44)
    (46) ""u-""ìtl6n} ""6štá-ma°wa°a qúrba l-ġðàðela.} ‘We have six villages that are
         near to one another.’ (B1:3)
    (47) píšla nepúxta ""u-práge gu-ġðàðe.} ‘The syrup and the millet seed were
         mixed together.’ (A23:21)
    (48) sìq6n} mj>mòy6lla q7se,} dráya r6š-ġðàðe.} ‘I went up and collected the
         wood and piled them up.’ (A23:34)Another means of expressing the reciprocity of an action is to use
constructions expressing the two individual participants with the forms
xa/ða . . . xena/xeta ‘one . . . the other’, e.g.
508                           chapter fourteen  (49) t8ra ‘ìmt5la baréy.} xùy5le.} xa-mxày5le l-o-xéna.} xa-mxày5le l-o-xéna.} ‘She

  (50) ""u-""í°wa †awált6t b6rràne,} xa-ráqa bá°6r d-ò-xena.} ‘There was the game

       significance of) scattering water over each other?’ (B6:10)
  (54) ""áni píšela màra} ða-†la-ða-xèta} ‘They started saying to one another . . .’
       (A12:60)
                      14.7. Adjectives and AppositivesAdjectives that modify a noun are generally placed after it. The attributive
function of adjectives is reflected not only by their syntactic function of
a modifier of a head noun but also by their inflection, in that attributive
adjectives, unlike referential nouns, do not normally express gender dif-
ferences in their plural form, e.g.      ""urza sniqa           ‘a needy man’
      baxta sniqta          ‘a needy woman’
      ""urze sniqe           ‘needy men’
      baxta°a sniqe         ‘needy women’Most adjectives, furthermore, are not used referentially in the same way
as nouns. The head noun can be omitted, but an adjective without a head
noun must normally take a pronominal head in the form of an indefinite
pronoun, when it is referentially indefinite, and in the form of demonstra-
tive pronoun when anaphorically definite, e.g.      xa-sniqa              ‘a needy one (ms.)’
      ""o-sniqa              ‘the needy one (ms.)’
      ða-sniqta             ‘a needy one (fs.)’
                           the syntax of nominals                               509     ""5–sniqta              ‘the needy one (fs.)’
     xakma sniqe            ‘some needy ones’ (pl.)
     ""an-sniqe              ‘the needy ones’ (pl.)These pronominal heads are closely related to relative clause heads and,
indeed, the constructions can be regarded as contracted relative clauses
(""o-sniqa < ""o-t-ile sniqa ‘the one who is needy’). If the adjective is extended
by an intensifier or by the comparative particle biš, the relative particle is
sometimes used in the phrase, e.g.  (1) ""o-t biš-daqìqa} ‘The one that (is) thinner’ (B10:49)Adjectives nominalized with a demonstrative head are often definite by
associative anaphora, typically when they express a member of a previ-
ously mentioned or implied set, e.g.  (2) †¬á°na bnóne díye zìlela} gu-dùnye,} †9yela} ""al-d-ò} da‰mána ta-t-xázi
      qa-""7n6t . . . babèy.} zílela mè†ye gu-ðá mðìta.} o-gò a} mère ""ána p7š6n láxxa
      gu-d-áyya mðìta.} ‘The three sons of his went on their way in the
      world, searching in order to find the remedy for the eyes of their
      father. They travelled and arrived in a certain town. The eldest one
      said “I shall remain here in this town.”’ (A24:3–4)
  (3) zòre-w5wa ""ánna xon>wá°i.} ""a-gó‰ta ""àn6nwa.} ‘These brothers of mine
      were young. The edler one (of the children) was me.’ (B8:13)
  (4) ""7-ga xáz6t yále zòre} ráqa bá°6r d-àn m6ndyáne} . . . ""áp ""an-gò‰e} mj>mìwa.}
      ‘Then you would see small children running after those things. . . . Also
      the older people would gather them.’ (B15:69)
  (5) ""ánna kúlla xìpla} ""an-zòre-w ""an-ràbe-w} ‘They all washed, young and
      old.’ (B10:69)As discussed in §14.3.2., when the default demonstrative is attached to
a noun, although often translated most idiomatically with the English
definite article, it is always anaphoric in function and is not used with
a noun that is definite by virtue of the descriptive content of the noun
alone without any anaphoric connection with the surrounding discourse.
For example, a noun referring to a generic class without any anaphoric
connection to what precedes would be definite, since the class it refers to
is assumed to be known to the hearer, but would not be combined with
a demonstrative, e.g.
510                          chapter fourteen  (6) ""árya héyw6n maxj6làna y-áwe.} ‘The lion is a terrifying animal.’An adjective with a default demonstrative head, on the other hand, may
refer to a non-anaphoric generic class. In such cases English most idiom-
atically uses the indefinite article, e.g.  (7) ""o-gó‰a g8r6g lá-maxe ""o-zòra.} ‘A big (person) should not hit a small
      (person).’
  (8) ""an-gó‰e g8r6g lá-maxi ""an-zòre.} ‘Big (people) should not hit small
      (people).’
  (9) ""o-kóra xa-záwga ""ˆne b8ye.} ‘A blind man wants a pair of eyes.’ (D2: 62)The explanation appears to be that an expression such as ""o-go‰a ‘the big’
is a reduced form of the relative phrase ""o-t-ile go‰a ‘he who is big’, in
which the demonstrative is anaphoric within the phrase, in that it binds
the referent of the pronoun to the description in the embedded relative
clause. The construction, therefore, assigns the property to the head,
like a predicative adjective, rather than presenting it as a component of
the description of the head. This analysis is supported by the fact that
resultative participles of atelic intransitive verbs may be combined with a
demonstrative, e.g. ""o-zmíra zmárta xàwrile} ‘The one who has sung the song
is my friend’. Such participles cannot be used as attributive modifiers of
nouns but can only be used predicatively (§15.4.1.1.). A phrase such as
""o-zmira, therefore, must be analysed as a reduced relative phrase in which
the participle is predicative (""o-t-ile zmira).
    Generic phrases are definite since they refer to an entire class, inclusive
of all its referents, which the hearer is assumed to be able to identify from
its description alone. A demonstrative cannot have ‘intra-phrasal’ anaphora
when a noun head is qualified by an adjective, e.g. ""o-naša go‰a ‘the big
man’, which must be anaphorically linked to the preceding discourse.
Intra-phrasal anaphora is only possible in constructions with a genitive/
relative particle D, or reduced forms of these constructions. This particle
can be regarded as the anaphor of the demonstrative. It follows that the
adjective in a phrase such as ""o-naša go‰a cannot be regarded as being a
reduced embedded relative ‘the man who is big’, whereas this analysis
is applicable to the adjective in a phrase such as ""o-go‰a, which can be
regarded as a reduced form of ""o-t-ile go‰a ‘Hei whoi is big’.
    Likewise a demonstrative can have intra-phrasal anaphoric reference in
annexation constructions, which contain the particle D. Again, the anaphor
of the demonstrative must be this particle. Examples: m-an-t-qanàne} ‘some
                           the syntax of nominals                             511of those with horns’ (A7:24), gu-d-ó garr6 zòre} ‘in the pool of young ones
(< garr6t zore)’ (B15:32), gu-d-o-gárra dìya} ‘in their pool’ (B15:32). The ref-
erents of none of these are mentioned in the preceding discourse.
  An indefinite nominalized adjective that has the indefinite cardinal
particle xa/ða as its head generally has a specific referent, e.g.  (10) mutt7°6lla †6¬¬ê° x6mm6ryá°a,} m-an-xm6ryá°6 tabzìye.} mutt7°6lla r6š-párš6t
       ""ˆna,} ða-smòqta,} ða-xwàrta,} ða-milànta.} ‘She laid down three beads,
       beads of a rosary. She put them on the stone slab of the spring,
       a red one, a white one and a blue one.’ (A25:34)In some circumstances it can be used when the phrase has a non-specific
referent, provided that it is extracted from a known, limited set. In a
context such as (11), for example, the phrase ða-smoqta ‘a red one’ can
have either a specific (‘one particular red one’) or non-specific (‘any of
the red ones’) interpretation:  (11) A: gu-sálla ""í° bé""e xwáre ""u-bé""e smòqe.} B: ""ána šáql6n ða-smòqta.} ‘A: In
       the basket there are white eggs and red eggs. B: I shall take a red
       one’The indefinite cardinal particle tends to be omitted, however, when the
existence of the set that it belongs to is unknown. A construction such as
that in (12), for example, would be used when the speaker has no evidence
that any big apples exist:  (12) la-hálli ""o-xabúša zòra,} ""ána b8y6n gò‰a.} ‘Don’t give me that small
       apple, I want a big one.’Similarly the cardinal particle is omitted in negative constructions when
the existence of the class is denied, e.g.  (13) gó‰a lì°.} ‘There is no big one.’
  (14) ""í°wa-w lì°wa} bíš m-álaha gò‰a} lí°wa gò‰a.} ‘There was and there was
       not, there was no great one greater than God.’ (A8:2)Nominalized plural adjectives typically take the indefinite pronoun xakma
as their head when they refer to a specific group of referents extracted
from a set, e.g.
512                          chapter fourteen  (15) A: gu-sálla ""í° bé""e xwáre ""u-bé""e smòqe.} B: ""ána šáql6n xakma-smòqe.} ‘A:
       In the basket there are white eggs and red eggs. B: I shall take
       some red ones.’When the speaker is not referring to a delimited specific group, but to a
non-specific open-ended group, the indefinite pronominal head tends to
be omitted. This applies to contexts such as the following:  (16) ""u-‘íd5le zóre-u gò‰e.} ‘He invited young and old.’ (A7:3)
  (17) xoš-sxí gu-d-ó garr6 zòre.} ‘Go and swim in the pool for young ones.’
       (B15:32)
  (18) ""í°6n . . . biš-šapìre mènni-w} ‘There are some more handsome than
       me.’ (A26:79)It is found in proverbial contexts referring to generic classes, e.g.  (19) b-núr6t rašíye y-áqði m6skène.} ‘By the fire of wicked people the poor
       burn.’ (D2:73)Likewise the head is omitted in negative constructions where the existence
of any members of a set are denied, e.g.  (20) ""6n-lì° biš-zlíme mènn6n,} har-t-àz6x.} ‘If there are none more wronged
       than us, we shall continue on our way.’ (A13:9)It is important to note that these constructions with headless adjectives
are found also with non-telic resultative participles, which cannot function
as adjective attributes but only as predicates, e.g.  (21) pálxi plìxe,} y-áxli nìxe.} ‘Those who have worked hard work but
       those who are inactive eat.’ (D2:33)It follows, therefore, that also these headless adjectives are not true nomi-
nalized adjectives but must be regarded as predicates of reduced relative
clauses without an explicitly expressed head (‘those who are big’, ‘those
who have worked’, etc.).
   When a plural adjective relating to a group of feminine gender has
a numeral as its head, the feminine form of the numeral may be used
although gender distinction is neutralized in the adjective inflection, e.g.
                           the syntax of nominals                       513  (22) bálki mabèrya t6rtè-xene.} ‘Perhaps it will give birth to two others.’
       (A5:8)There are some items that act as attributes of nouns but distinguish
between genders in their plural inflection. This applies to gentilic expres-
sions ending in -aya, e.g.     ""urza suraya               ‘a Christian man’
     baxta sur5°a               ‘a Christian woman’
     ""urze suraye               ‘Christian men’
     baxta°a suraya°a           ‘Christian women’Furthermore, such gentilic expressions can be used as referential head
nouns in a wider range of contexts than other adjectives, with a distribu-
tion that is equivalent to that of other nouns. Notably, they can be used
as indefinite nouns with a specific referent, anaphorically definite and
generically definite nouns without obligatorily being combined with the
indefinite particle or a demonstrative pronoun, e.g. suraya ‘a/the Chris-
tian’. They have a greater independence than other adjectives and have
a lesser need for a head:     Specific indefinite     Anaphoric definite      Generic definite
     xa-sniqa                ""o-sniqa                ""o-sniqa
     (xa-)suraya             (""o-)suraya             surayaOn distributional grounds, therefore, it would be more appropriate to
interpret the gentilic forms in attributive position as nominal apposi-
tives rather than adjectives. Their status as nouns is reflected by greater
independence and a noun-like feminine plural ending. The noun-like
nature of gentilic forms is also identifiable in their semantic content, in
that they have stability over time, denoting, in principle, the permanent
constellation of properties of a class rather than contingent qualities. A
distinction, therefore, can be made in terminology between ‘quality-denot-
ing’ terms such as sniqa and ‘class-denoting’ terms such as suraya. Both
‘quality-denoting’ and ‘class-denoting’ terms can function as attributes,
but their morpho-syntactic behaviour is different.
   The feminine plural ending is regularly used with attributes ending in
-aya when they are gentilic. Further examples:
514                          chapter fourteen      baxta°a huðaya°a           ‘Jewish women’
      baxta°a durnaya°a          ‘women from Dure’
      baxta°a ""5n-nunaya°a       ‘women from ""“n-Nune’
      baxta°a naxraya°a          ‘foreign women’The feminine plural ending is used also in the attributes šulxaya ‘naked’
and xaya (f. x5°a recently given birth), which end in -aya but is not gen-
tilic, e.g.      baxta°a šulxaya°a          ‘naked women’
      baxta°a xaya°a             ‘women who have recently given birth’This pattern of agreement in these lexical items has presumably arisen
by analogy with gentilics. It has not, however, been extended to all non-
gentilic adjectives ending in -aya, as shown by the following, all of which
take the ending -e when they are attributes of feminine plural nouns:      baxta°a x6pyaye            ‘barefooted women’
      baxta°a komaye             ‘black women’
      baxta°a qamaye             ‘the first women’
      tawriya°a rešaye           ‘the highest quality cows’When nominals denoting professions such as zamara ‘singer’ and raqaða
‘dancer’ are used as attributes, they regularly agree with feminine plural
nouns and should be regarded as class-denoting appositives rather than
adjectival modifiers:      baxta°a zamarya°a          ‘singer women’
      baxta°a raqaðya°a          ‘dancer women’The nominal xam°a ‘beautiful woman’ also agrees with feminine plural
nouns when it is used as an attribute:      baxta°a xama°a              ‘beautiful women’The attribute of a noun is sometimes expressed by appositives consisting of
other types of nouns, e.g. súsa š7na ‘a tame horse’, ""úrza gáw‰a ‘a brave man’
(A29:27), xabúšta ""ixàla} ‘an apple tree bearing edible fruit’ (B5:104).
  Speakers occasionally use the feminine plural ending on adjectives end-
ing in -ana, but in all cases an alternative with the -e ending is available.
                          the syntax of nominals                           515This applies to adjectives with the ending -ana that belong to the active
participle patterns and also other forms, e.g.     baxta°a ""axlanya°a ~ ""axlane             ‘gluttonous women’
     baxta°a palxanya°a ~ palxane             ‘hard-working women’
     tawriya°a maxj6lanya°a ~ maxj6lane       ‘frightening cows’
     baxta°a hawnanya°a ~ hawnane             ‘clever women’In general, there is a degree of subjectiveness in the use of the feminine
plural on non-gentilic adjectives. The motivation for giving the adjective the
noun-type inflection -a°a may be to make the adjective more independent
from its head for the sake of endowing it with greater prominence. Perhaps
this is the reason why -a°a is normally used on the adjective šulxaya ‘naked’
in phrases such as baxta°a šulxaya°a ‘naked women’, where it expresses a
perceptually salient property! The feminine ending is sporadically found
on non-gentilic adjectives that are in predicative position, e.g.  (23) r6myà°a hawetúwa!} ‘May you (fpl.) be cursed ones!’ (A26:27)In such cases, again, the use of the feminine ending endows the adjective
with the status of a noun (‘cursed ones’). The effect is to present them as
having the permanent time-stability typical of nouns. In (23) this strategy
is used to give particular force to the curse.
   Another way in which attributive adjectives are given prominence is
to combine them with a default demonstrative, e.g. xoni ""o-go‰a ‘my big
brother’, xa°i ""a-zurta ‘my little sister’. As remarked above, the demonstra-
tive supplies a head for the adjective. A construction such as xoni ""o-go‰a,
therefore, consists of two heads and the phrase ""o-go‰a should be consider to
have the status of a noun in apposition rather than an adjectival modifier.
By giving the attribute this syntactic independence the speaker endows it
with added prominence. The construction is used both when the attribute
is restrictive and also when it is non-restrictive.
   The construction is used with a restrictive attribute when the attribute
contrasts between members of a known set designated by the noun, e.g.  (24) ""í°wa xa-màlka} ""í°wale ""árbi bnòne.} br ō\ n-diye ""o-zòra} ""ítwale ""arbì
       šènne.} . . . xóna ""o-gó‰a mère ‘ú-m6ndi lax-xêzye.} ‘There was a king.
       He had forty sons. His little son was forty years old. . . . The elder
       brother said . . .’ (A12:1/17)
516                            chapter fourteenIn such contrastive contexts this construction is used also with gentilic
attributes, which, as we have seen, are best considered appositives even
without the demonstrative, e.g.  (25) ""í° tré-yale làxxa,} xa-suràya} ""u-xa-huðàya.} yála ""o-suráya diyˆnile.} ‘There
       are two children here, one Christian and one Jewish. The Christian
       child is ours’.","[536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542, 543, 544, 545, 546, 547, 548, 549, 550, 551, 552, 553, 554, 555]"
"  (25) Fárxo mêre} ""áp-""ana m†ál6n m6nnˆxu.} zòr5le.} ‘Farxo said “I also shall
       play with you.” He was young.’ (A25:87)

       and met the teacher. The teacher—the shop (he was in) was big.’
       (A22:18)
  (28) qìmt5la} wíðt6lle ""ixàla,} bè""e.} qèdamt5la.} ‘She made him food, some
       eggs. It was early morning.’ (A23:4)15.3.1.2. The Independent Basic Copula
The independent basic copula is marked with regard to the nature of the
predicate and subject and also with regard to the communicative salience
of the proposition expressed by the clause.
  There are restrictions with regard to the type of predicate and subject
that occur in this construction. The predicate is identificatory or expresses
626                             chapter fifteena permanent property of the subject, which is typically an intrinsic defin-
ing property rather than an acquired property. It is not used when the
predicate denotes a contingent situation. The subject of the construction
is always high in topicality. There is no restriction, however, regarding the
referential status of the subject, in that it may have a specific referent or
denote a generic class. This is illustrated in the following examples,  (1)  ""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl.’ (A29:63)
  (2)  ""ána ""íw6n Yúw6l Yu˙ànna.} ‘I am Yuw6l Yu˙anna.’ (A1:1)
  (3)  ""áxni ""íw6x màlke.} ‘We are kings.’ (A18:8)
  (4)  ""áwwa ""íle sulàqa.} ‘This is the (festival of) Ascension.’ (B6:7)
  (5)  b7°6t Qára Té≥din qìdle.} Qára Té≥din ""íle xêtne díye.} ‘The house of
       Qara Te≥din has burnt down. Qara Te≥din is his brother-in-law.’
       (A26:55)
  (6) ""í°wal6n ßàwma,} yá'ni ""éða y-a°éwa m6n-ßàwma.} ßáwma ""íle xamšì yomá°a.}
       ‘We had a fast, that is the festival came after a fast. The fast is fifty
       days.’ (B5:52)
  (7) ""áxxa ""í°ena dàwla.} dáwla ""íle xa-sandùqa} réše p°íx5le d7r5 xê††e gáwe.}
       ‘Here there is a drum. The drum is a box, with an open top, in
       which they put wheat.’ (B6:54)
  (8) °áy5le qàša} ""u-sá‰a gnùn5le.} ""ó gnúna ""íle nišànqa.} ‘The priest comes
       and ties the band. The band is a symbol.’ (B5:44)
  (9) ""u-kùt-xa} ""ítle góm6t g yàne,} ""ítle dúka mruzágta y-amrèxla dùna.} . . . góma
       ""íle gawàye,} dúna ""íle qam-t9ra.} ‘Everybody has his own basement
       stable and a place prepared (for feeding), which we call a duna
       (feeding pen). . . . The basement stable is inside and the feeding
       pen is outside.’ (B5:110)
  (10) xàr°a} y-a°él5ni ""èða} ""éð6t be-yàlda.} ""éð6t be-yálda ""íle w7°6t Mšìxa.} ‘Then
       we have (another) festival, the festival of Christmas. The festival of
       Christmas is (in commemoration of) the birth of Christ.’ (B6:12)The high topicality of the subject item in (4)–(10) arises from the fact that
its referent has been referred to in the immediately preceding discourse,
where it is an item of central concern. In the case of full nominal sub-
jects, moreover, the nominal itself has typically been mentioned in the
preceding clause, as can be seen in the examples. Constructions such as
(1)–(3) with 1st person pronominal subjects, however, often occur at the
beginning of speech. One factor contributing to the high topicality of the
subject referent could be that the referent of the pronoun is present and
observable by the hearer in the speech situation. Another factor is that
                              the syntax of verbs                                 627such clauses are typically used at the beginning of a speech in which the
first person referent plays a prominent role in the subsequent clauses. We
may call this forward pointing topicality. This is the case, for example,
with the discourse following the clause adduced in (1) above, which is
reproduced below:  (11) ""ána ""íw6n Rust8mo bròn-t-Zàlo,} . . . hon-""è°ya †láb6lla bràtux,} nablènna
       †la-bàbi.} ‘I am Rustam son of Zàl . . . I have come seeking the hand
       of your daughter, in order to take her to my father.’ (A29:63)A construction with an independent copula is marked with regard to
communicative salience. It is used in clauses expressing assertive, factive
propositions, which are high in communicative salience in that the speaker
is committed to their factuality, but it is not used to express non-factive
propositions such as interrogative clauses, in which the proposition is
being questioned. If the clause is interrogative, the enclitic copula on the
predicate is used. This is illustrated in (12), which contains assertive and
interrogative clauses:  (12) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome} ""u-yàrxa} ""íle †¬a°ì-yome.} ""áxtu šab°7xu
       ""6štà-yomela?} yarx7xu ""6sri-w-""6óóà-yomele?} ‘A week for us is seven days
       and a month is thirty days. Is your week six weeks? Is your month
       twenty-nine days?’ (A17:13)The communicative salience of the construction gives the clause a degree
of independence from the preceding discourse. This is often exploited to
express some kind of reorientation in the discourse. When the subject is
a 3rd person pronoun or a nominal that has been mentioned in the pre-
ceding discourse, the construction is generally used to express some kind
of elaborative background on what precedes. It can be seen as a device
to mark a boundary or discontinuity in the flow of the discourse. This is
a common discourse usage of contructions with communicative salience.
Alternatively communicative salience of the construction is sometimes
exploited to give prominence to a statement deemed to be of particular
importance. This applies especially to clauses with a 1st or 2nd person
pronominal subject (1–3). These often occur at the beginning of a section
of discourse.
   When the subject of the independent copula is pronominal, in some
cases it is expressed only by the inflection of the copula and is not real-
ized by an independent pronoun, e.g.
628                            chapter fifteen  (13) ""5-màsta} ""i-d5ríla gu-gùða.} gúða mòdile?} ""íle gèld6t xa-hèyw6n.} ‘They put
       the yoghurt in a churn. What is a churn? It is an animal skin.’
       (B6:38)
  (14) x7la díya mòdile} t-mazvêrra?} ""íla mìya.} ‘What is its power, which turns
       it? It is water.’ (B6:53)
  (15) ba""ú°6t ninwàye} . . . l7le ""éða diyàna.} ""íle ""éða qàwmi.} ‘The Rogation of
       the Ninevites is not a religious festival. It is a national festival.’
       (B6:17)Occasionally the independent copula with its own stress is placed after
the predicate, e.g.  (16) ""ána Qára Tè≥din ""íw6n.} ‘I am Qara Te≥din.’ (A26:68)
  (17) ""ána brònux ""íw6n.} ‘I am your son.’ (A18:7)
  (18) ""áw har-xá-mdi ""ìle.} ‘It is something.’ (A14:25)15.3.1.3. Enclitic Copula Attached to the Subject
When the subject of the clause is high in topicality, the copula in some
instances does not stand independently with its own stress but rather is
cliticized to the subject, e.g.  (1)   ""áyy5la óìta.} ‘This is butter.’ (B6:41)
  (2)   ""u-""áyy5la kùlla.} ‘This is all (the story).’ (A4:24)
  (3)   ""áw-ile sí‰a bìya.} ‘It is tied to it.’ (B6:55)
  (4)   xúwwele q†ìla!} ‘The snake is killed!’ (A24:42)These constructions share with the independent copula construction the
feature of having subjects with topical prominence. In the examples cited
above, the referent of the subject has been referred to in the immediately
preceding discourse where it is of central concern. The clauses are, how-
ever, unmarked with regard to the nature of the predicate, in that they
may express either a contingent or a permanent property of the subject.
They are also unmarked with regard to the communicative salience and
assertiveness of the proposition of the clause as a whole. This is shown
by the fact that the construction is used in interrogative clauses containing
interrogative words that are in the subject position, e.g.  (5)   ""7nile gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Who is in the house?’
  (6)   ""7nile zaqàra?} ‘Who is a weaver?’
                                 the syntax of verbs                         629Such constructions, therefore, are close in function to clauses with the
copula cliticized to the predicate, which are likewise unmarked with regard
to the nature of the predicate and the communicative salience of the clause.
They differ only in the marked status of the subject referent, in that this
must be an item that is topically prominent. The placement of the copula
on the interrogative subject as in (5) and (6) can be interpreted as a reflec-
tion of the topical prominence of the interrogative word. It is not topically
prominent by virtue of being informationally given, but rather since it is
what the question primarily requests information about.5 Moreover it has
a feature analogous to what has been described above as forward pointing
topicality. This is because the referent of the interrogative constituent is
typically expected to be identified in the subsequent discourse.
   The notion of forward pointing topicality also explains the attachment
of the copula in (7) to the adverbial hád6x, which is linked as a correlative
to the following prepositional phrase:  (7) ""ítli ðá brat6t-màma} hád6x-ila š†rànta} max-d-àwwa yóma.} ‘I have a cousin.
      She is as beautiful as this sun (lit. She is thus beautiful, like this
      sun).’ (A7:17)15.3.2. The Deictic Copula
As is the case with the independent basic copula, the deictic copula exhibits
certain restrictions with regard to the nature of the predicate and subject
and also with regard to the communicative salience of the proposition
expressed by the clause. It is generally used when the predicate expresses
a contingent situation that is not necessarily a permanent property of the
subject. It may be used without any other clause constituents to draw atten-
tion to the location of a referent in the current speech situation, e.g.  (1) mère kˆla tóto?} mère hòla.} ‘He said “Where is grandma?” He said
      “There she is (as we speak).” ’ (A7:24)In many cases it is combined with a locative adverbial in the predicate.
Examples from the text corpus:  (2) yoná°a hóla reše-reše-dìye.} ‘Doves are over him.’ (A25:58)
  5
      For the topicality of interrogative words see Steedman (2000: 659).
630                            chapter fifteen  (3)   hóla skínta mênne.} ‘A knife is with him (= he has a knife).’ (A30:21)
  (4)   ""u-hóla wajjúwe díya làxxa.} ‘and her personal effects are here.’
        (A21:9)
  (5)   baxtá°6n hóla yaqúre t6rwê°na.} ‘Our wives are both pregnant.’ (A25:2)
  (6)   xètna hóle zína l-gàre.} ‘The groom is standing on the roof.’ (B8:34)Examples (2)–(6) all express contingent situations that hold at the moment
of speaking, but are not presented as permanent. The subjects are of
various different types of informational value including newly introduced
referents (2)–(3), referents that are anchored by a pronominal suffix to the
a previously mentioned referent (4) or to the participants of the speech
situation (5) and a referent that is explicitly given in the preceding dis-
course (6).
   The construction with the deictic copula is occasionally used where the
predicate is intended to express a permanent property of the subject. In
such cases the subject is generally a referent that has been newly intro-
duced into the discourse, e.g.  (7)  xa-bráta hóla tàma.} ‘A girl is there.’ (A25:68)
  (8)  ""Ón-Nùne} hóla npílta gu-""á°‰6t Bàrw6r.} ""“n-Nune lies in the land of
       Barwar.’ (B4:1)
  (9) qìm5le,} šèmm6t má°a díye wéwa Barwòre.} ""ámte dìye} hóla gu-Sàrzar} ""u-xále
       dìye} hóle gu-Daštàne.} ‘The name of his village was Barwore. His
       aunt is in Sarzar and his uncle is in Daštane.’ (A23:1)
  (10) ""í°6n xà""a} hóle gu-Kàrkuk.} ‘There is a person, he is in Kirkuk.’
       (A16:1)
  (11) kúlla p6lxàna,} p6lxán6t b7°a hóle b-qðàli.} ‘All the work, the work of
       the house is my duty (literally: is on my neck).’ (A21:27)The deictic copula may be used to express a permanent property in a
clause that has a topical, informationally given, subject. In such cases the
speaker draws special attention to the proposition expressed by the clause
rather than to the referent of the subject, e.g.  (12) ""aw-""7ne díye npílt5la ""isêq°e} ""ám6r hà!} hóla gwìrta!} ‘His eye fell on his
       ring and he said “Ah, she is married!” ’ (A26:31)In (12) the deictic copula gives particular prominence to the proposition
that ‘she is married’ due to the fact that the speaker is surprised by the
discovery of this unexpected situation.
                           the syntax of verbs                           631   In principle the subject of a deictic copula has a specific referent and
does not denote a generic class. Examples are sometimes encountered that
appear to go against this principle, such as (6) above where the subject
xètna (‘the groom’) is referring generically to the groom in any wedding.
In such cases the speaker is no doubt presenting the subject as if it were
a specific case of the class concerned for the sake of vividness.
   Constructions with the deictic copula are marked with regard to com-
municative salience, as is the case with the independent basic copula.
It is used in clauses expressing assertive, factive propositions, which are
high in communicative salience in that the speaker is committed to their
factuality, but it is not used to express non-factive propositions such as
interrogative clauses, in which the proposition is being questioned. If the
clause is interrogative, the enclitic copula on the predicate is used.  (13) baxtá°6n hóla yaqùre.} ‘Our wives are pregnant.’
  (14) baxtá°6n yaqùrela?} ‘Are our wives pregnant?’If a question does not relate to the factuality of a proposition, the deictic
copula may be used, e.g.  (15) qa-mó brónux hóle gu-bˆ°a? ‘Why is your son in the house?’The deictic copula is also used in an assertion that is embedded in a
question, e.g.  (16) lá-m6r5xu ""áyya qußárta hóla b-""ùrxa?} ‘Did you not say that this cook-
       ing pot is on the way (to giving birth)?’ (A5:5)In general the deictic copula is a device for drawing the particular attention
of the hearer to something in the immediate speech situation. This may
be a property of the subject expressed in the predicate that is observable
in the immediate situation, but not necessarily a permanent property, or
a permanent property that is unexpected. Alternatively it may be a ref-
erent that is newly introduced into the discourse and, therefore, worthy
of particular attention. In some cases, both of these conditioning factors
may be operative. The ultimate decision as to whether a basic copula or
a deictic copula is used, however, depends on the degree of prominence
that the speaker wishes to give to the subject referent or the predication
in a particular discourse context. Consider, for example, (17):
632                            chapter fifteen  (17) xa-šaqòl5le} mkùl‘5le} ""u-xa-xèna} ða-""à†ma} hóla sàxi.} mère ""áyya ""à†ma}
       nablètla ""6lla-dìya.} ‘One is a shank, it is stripped (of its meat).
       Another, a thigh, is in good condition. He said (to the servant)
       “Take this thigh to her.” ’ (A30:30)Here both the ‘shank’ and the ‘thigh’ are newly introduced referents and
the predications concerning them both denote contingent situations that
exist at the time of speaking. The narrator, however, wishes to give greater
prominence in the discourse to the ‘thigh’ since this is the concern of the
following speech.
   The deictic copula may be used to draw attention to the situation as
a whole expressed by a clause when this marks the onset of a section of
discourse and provides the background for what follows. Consider the
wider context of (5) cited above:  (18) málka mère †la-d-o-xóne f>qìra,} mère xòni} baxtá°6n hóla yaqúre t6rwê°na.}
       ""6n-báxtux mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxti mu°éla bròna,} brátux qa-bròni.} ""6n-báxti
       mu°éla bràta} ""u-báxtux mu°éla bròna,} ""a-bráti qa-brònux.} ‘The king
       said to the poor brother, he said “My brother, our wives are both
       pregnant. If your wife gives birth to a girl and my wife gives birth
       to boy, your daughter (will be married) to my son. If my wife gives
       birth to a daughter and your wife gives birth to a son, my daughter
       (will be married) to your son.” ’ (A25:2–3)The predicate of the independent basic copula, on the other hand,
expresses that a certain property is a permanent feature of the subject
but does not specify whether this property is observable in the immediate
speech situation. Similarly the independent basic copula does not draw
attention to the subject of the clause, since it is already activated in the
consciousness of the hearer due to its high degree of topicality.
   It is likely that the basic copula originated as a presentative construction,
similar in function to the deictic copula that is in use today. This explains
the use of the L-suffixes in the 3rd person, which originally expressed the
object of the presentative. At some stage this old presentative would have
lost its presentative function and been cliticized to the predicate, in con-
formity with the syntactic position of verbal inflection. This would have
been accompanied by the emergence of a new presentative device in the
form of the deictic copula. The construction with the basic independent
copula placed before the predicate, e.g. brónux ""íle xàwri} ‘Your son is my
                            the syntax of verbs                             633friend’ is likely to reflect a transitional stage of this development which
has survived in the modern dialect. As remarked, this construction does
not have an attention-drawing function to the same degree as the deictic
copula, but it nevertheless has greater communicative salience than the
construction with the enclitic copula.
   The deictic copula may be used with past tense reference in the context
of clauses with past verb forms, e.g.  (19) xa-pà‰a,} wiðále gáne max-qêšta.} Fárxo ""u-S6ttíye hóla k6s-©ðàðe.} ‘One
       lamb made itself like a bow. Farxo and S6ttiye were together.’
       (A25:28–29)
  (20) qím5le ""ap-Fárxo šqíl6lle zòrna,} mxáya zòrna,} bejíye hóla xa-gòta} ""èrwa
       xa-gòta.} ‘Farxo also took up the pipe and played pipe music, the
       young lambs were one side and the sheep the other.’ (A25:31)
  (21) hóla ""i°á°a gu-lˆša,} lyáša kùbbe,} ""u-""ê°y5le} bába dìya} ""u-w9zìr.} ‘Her
       hands were in dough, while kneading the meat-balls, and her
       father and the vizier came.’ (A21:26)
  (22) múßly6lla dìw6n.} díw6n t-xále díye hóla dwìqta.} ‘He brought them down
       to the meeting room. The meeting room of his uncle was full.’
       (A23:14)The deictic copula may be combined with the expressions heš ‘still’, hal-
díya ‘until now’, and har ‘already, still’, which imply that the situation has
an end-point or starting-point and is not permanent, e.g.  (23) ""áy heš-hóla gu-gòma.} ‘She is still in the basement stable.’ (A18:22)
  (24) jullèk°a hóla hár qrúšta rèša.} ‘As for the bowl (of yoghurt)—here, its
       crust is still on it.’ (A30:24)
  (25) ""áp-""o-†¬a°a q6m-p5rmìle.} ""u-d6bbóre hár-hola qam-t8r6t bòya.} ‘They
       slaughtered also the third one. The hornets were still before the
       door of the hole.’ (A20:9)
  (26) hal-díya hóla gu-móx6n ""áyya ""áxni.} ‘Until now this is in our memory.’
       (B16:12)Occasionally the deictic copula is placed after the predicate, e.g.  (27) ""árye dìye} k6s-báxte dìye hóla.} ‘His lions are with his wife.’ (A18:19)
  (28) ""7ne p°ìxt5la,} bas-†lìya hóle.} ‘His eye is open, but he is asleep.’
       (A31:6)
634                            chapter fifteenThe deictic copula is sometimes used to present a nominal, denoting its
existence without ascribing any property to it in a predicate, e.g.  (29) hóla ""isèq°a dìya.} ‘Here is her ring.’ (A25:69)
  (30) hóla zeðàye.} ‘Here are the breads.’ (A30:24)
  (31) hó""la mìya.} ‘Here is some water.’ (A28:18)15.3.3. The Copula in Subordinate Clauses
The distinction between the various copula constructions described above
are neutralized in subordinate clauses that are introduced by the condi-
tional particle ""6n and the general subordinating particle D. The latter
has various functions, such as a relativizer and complementizer, and is
often combined with other particles. If a copula clause occurs in such
clauses, the enclitic copula is always used, rather than the independent
or deictic copula, and this is attached to the particle at the head of the
clause, e.g.  (1)   ""6n-íle mì°a,} g8r6g mˆ°6n.} ‘If he is dead, I must die.’ (A8:61)
  (2)   ""6n-ít xonˆni,} háyyo tu-""áxxa k6slˆni.} ‘If you are our brother, come
        and sit here with us.’ (A39:7)
  (3)   ""6n-íle xwarzàyi,} t-á°e t-y>ðéla ""ánna mòdila} ""u-módi lˆla} xo-d-áwwa
        jùlla.} ‘If he is my nephew, he will come and know what these are
        or are not under this cloth.’ (A25:49)
  (4)   si-prúmle ""áwwa yála zòra} t-íle gu-dudìya.} ‘Go and slaughter this baby
        boy who is in the cradle.’ (A15:8)
  (5)   xìl6lle ""o-""ixála t-íle kêsle.} ‘He ate the food that was in front of him.’
        (A23:5)
  (6)   xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa.} ‘Let’s look for a man who is a
        hard worker.’ (A21:3)
  (7)   ""ánna y8ði t-íle duglàna.} ‘They know that he is a liar.’ (A48:3)
  (8)   l5t-xzáya bíye díye t-íle mì°a?} ‘Don’t you see that he is dead?’
        (A17:2)15.3.4. Copula on Focused Elements
The distinction between the various types of copula is neutralized also
when the speaker wishes to place a particular focus on one argument of
the clause. In such circumstances only the enclitic copula is used, even
where in equivalent clauses without such argument focus the deictic or
                             the syntax of verbs                                635independent copula occurs. The enclitic copula is attached to the focused
element, whether this be the subject or a component of the predicate of
the clause. The focused element bears the nuclear stress and is typically
moved to the front of the clause if is not already situated there. This
type of construction is used when the speaker wishes to put a contrastive
focus on one argument. In what follows the focus is represented in the
translation with italics:  (1) A: bróni hóle gu-bˆ°a.} B: là,} bàbux-ile gu-b7°a,} lá brònux.} ‘A: “My son
      is in the house”. B: “No, your father is in the house, not your son.” ’
  (2) A: bróni hóle dmíxa gu-bˆ°a.} B: là,} gu-kˆrm5le dmíxa,} lá gu-bˆ°a.} ‘A:
      “My son is asleep in the house”. B: “No, he is asleep in the orchard,
      not in the house.” ’
  (3) A: ""áwwa ""íle xêtna.} B: là,} qrìw5le ""áwwa,} lá xêtna.} ‘A: “This is the
      groom”. B: “No, this is the best-man, not the groom.” ’
  (4) A: ""áwwa ""ile mtúrßa m6n-kèpa.} B: là,} m6n-qˆs5le mtúrßa,} lá m6n-kèpa.}
      ‘A: “This is made of stone”. B: “No, this is made of wood, not of
      stone.” ’Examples from the text corpus:  (5) ""áwwa lˆle kálba.} ""àtit kálba.} ‘He is not a dog. you are a dog’ (A11:2)
  (6) ""áni xšíwela dêbb5la táma.} ‘They thought the bear (not the bees) was
      there.’ (A10:7)The contrastive focus may be an informationally given referent, as in the
following:  (7) A: ""èdyo xzéli xón6t Dawíð ""u-bròn-màme. bròn-máme ""íle zaqàra.} B: là,} xònele
      zaqára,} lá bròn-màme.} ‘A: “Today I saw the brother of David and
      his cousin. His cousin is a weaver”. B: “No, his brother is a weaver,
      not his cousin.” ’This neutralization applies only to strong focus, as is the case with contras-
tive focus. It is not necessarily used with a simple new information focus,
as is seen in constructions such as the following:  (8) A: ""7nile gu-bˆ°a?} B: brònux hóle gu-b7°a.} ‘A: “Who is in the house?”
      B: “Your son is in the house” ’.
  (9) A: ""ˆnile? B: ""áw ""íle xòni} ‘A: “Who is he?” B: “He is my brother” ’.
636                              chapter fifteen15.3.5. Past Copula Placed after the Predicate
The past copula may be placed after or before the predicate. Constructions
with the copula after the predicate are unmarked with regard to the nature
of the subject and predicate and also with regard to the communicative
salience of the proposition expressed by the clause. The predicate may
express a permanent situation in the past (1–6) or one that is contingent
to a particular moment or space of time and exists only temporally (7–9).
The subject may have a specific referent or denote a generic class. In most
cases the copula is cliticized to the predicate:  (1)   yèmme díye yêmmi-wawa} . . . bábe díye bàbiwa.} ‘His mother was my
        mother . . . His father was my father.’ (A32:31)
  (2)   ""Ëšwu† rába krèt-iwa gu-""à°‰a.} ‘February was very bad in our country.’
        (B5:152)
  (3)   ma‰ú°a mturáßt5wa m-qˆsa.} ‘The snow shovel was made of wood.’
        (B5:196)
  (4)   ""ína báte qám°a †ìna-w5wa.} ‘Formerly, however, houses were made
        of mud.’ (B5:198)
  (5)   fa-xayu°éy b-dawˆr5wa.} ‘Their livelihood was in the mule.’ (B5:126)
  (6)   xóne díye f>qìra-wewa.} ‘His brother was poor.’ (A25:1)
  (7)   gu-bˆ°a wéwa,} har-zála-w °àya.} ‘He was in the house, walking back
        and forth.’ (A6:1)
  (8)   b-yárx6t šàww5wa,} . . . xošèb5wa.} . . . koðènta b-ìði-yawa} šulxˆ°a.} . . . ""ána
        šobàn6nwa xá‘‘a.} ‘It was in the month of July . . . it was a Sun-
        day . . . The mule was in my hand . . . I was suffering from a bit of
        a cold.’ (B5:130)
  (9)   w-áw xamìm5wa,} pšìra,} ßèlya gu-tàlga.} ‘It was warm, (the snow) melted
        and it dropped down into the snow.’ (B5:154)The unmarkedness of the construction with regard to the communica-
tive salience of the proposition it expresses is shown by the fact that it is
used both in assertive, factive clauses and also in non-factive, interrogative
clauses, e.g.  (10) xónux gu-bˆ°5wa.} ‘Your brother was in the house.’
  (11) xónux gu-bˆ°5wa?} ‘Was your brother in the house?’On some occasions the copula bears its own stress, e.g.
                             the syntax of verbs                              637  (12) ""áni milàne ""iy7wa.} ‘They were green.’ (B5:218)
  (13) xá gáw‰a x5lána-w zàxma wéwa.} ‘He was a powerful, tough man.’
       (A27:1)
  (14) sab-qyámta b-lˆle ""iyáwa.} ‘because Easter was at night.’ (B5:53)15.3.6. Past Copula Placed before the Predicate
Constructions with the copula placed before the predicate are likewise
unmarked with regard to the nature of the predicate, in that it may
express a permanent (1–7) or contingent (8–9) situation. There is no past
form of the deictic copula and the construction Subject—""iwa—Predicate,
therefore, corresponds to both that of the independent present copula
(Subject—""ile—Predicate) and that of the deicitc copula (Subject—hole—
Predicate).  (1)   m6lxáwa ""íwa mtúrßa m-qˆsa.} ‘The winnowing fork was made from
        wood.’ (B5:87)
  (2)   w-áw ""iwéwa malàxa.} ""áw y>ðéwala ""áyya tuní°6t B6lbèl Hazàr.} ‘He was
        an angel. He knew the story of B6lb6l Hazar.’ (A8:25)
  (3)   gá""at tèrte xzéle málka dúnye ráya dèwe.} xèlm6t málka ""íwa ""úp-""aw zàwna.}
        ‘The second time the king saw (in his dream) that it was raining
        wolves. Also that dream of the king was (like) the time.’ (A1:24)
  (4)   ""u-""áy ""iyéwa qèßß6t yá'ni rêzza.} ‘That was the story of rice’ (B5:87)
  (5)   dawˆra} ""íwa xa-mèndi ""ax-t-ámr6x ""íðe-w ""àqle y-amrèxla} ‘The mule was
        something that was (as important to somebody as) “his hands and
        his legs,” as we say.’ (B5:124)
  (6)   Nìnwe} ""iwáwa pét6xt ""a°oràye.} ‘Nineveh was the capital of the Assyr-
        ians.’ (B6:17)
  (7)   ""í°wa xa-Xáno Lapzèrin.} b-""8ß6l díye ""iwéwa q>r>‘àya.} ‘There was a cer-
        tain Xano the Golden Hand. In origin he was a gypsy.’ (A11:1)
  (8)   hadíya mšár6x q6ßßètt6t M8mo-w Zìne.} M9mo} ""íwewa gu-""Al?n} ""u-Zíne
        ""iwáwa gu-Jazíre Bòta.} ‘Now we shall begin the story of M>mo and
        Zine. M>mo was in ""Alàn and Zine was in Jazire Bota.’ (A26:1)
  (9)   m-bar-hàd6x} q5mìwa} mzabóne ""ilàna.} náše ""íwa kòpa.} ‘After that they
        would sell the tree. The people were below.’ (B5:42)When the clause expresses a permanent situation, the subject typically has
topical prominence, as is the case in Subject—""ile—Predicate construc-
tions. In the examples occurring in the text corpus, the topical prominence
generally results from the fact that the referent has been evoked in the
638                           chapter fifteenimmediately preceding context. Note that in (5), however, the referent has
not been previously activated, but it plays a central role in the following
context.
   When the copula is placed before the predicate, the clause has some
kind of communicative salience. This is reflected by the fact that it is
restricted to assertive, factive clauses and is not used in non-factive, inter-
rogative clauses. The communicative salience in the examples occurring
in the text corpus can in most cases be shown to have a discourse func-
tion. The clauses generally mark some kind of semantic boundary in
the discourse. In (1) and (2) the copula clauses constitute an explanatory
elaboration concerning a referent that has been evoked in the preceding
context that breaks the flow of the discourse. Also in (3) the construc-
tion is used in a clause that is explanatory of what precedes. The clause
in (4) is a summarizing remark, which marks the end of a section. The
constructions in (5)–(7) occur at the beginning of a section of discourse
that supply important preliminary material. The same applies also to (8),
where the construction is used to express a contingent situation. In (9) the
copula clause denotes a contingent situation that is circumstantial to the
event referred to in the previous clause and does not carry the narrative
line forward.
   In (10) the past copula is used in a different type of function, namely
to introduce a time adverbial at an episodic boundary of discourse. The
copula here gives morpological weight to the initial adverbial expression
and is not translatable directly into idiomatic English:  (10) ""íwa sá""6t tmánya qédamta xzéli xákma náše °àya} m6n-""æn-Nune ta-Dùre.}
       ‘At eight o’clock in the morning I saw some people coming from
       ""“n-Nune to Dure.’ (B1:11)15.3.7. The Negative Copula
The present and past negative copula forms refer to states, both per-
manent (1–3) and contingent (4–6), in the present and past respectively.
They correspond, therefore, to both the basic and deictic forms of the
positive copula:  (1)   ""áwwa lˆle kálba.} ‘He is not a dog.’ (A11:20)
  (2)   l7w6t d-áwwa ""à°‰a.} ‘You are not from this land.’ (A25:82)
  (3)   xu-l7wa †axxána bròn-taxxanˆ°a?} ‘Was he not a miller the son of a
        miller-woman?’ (A32:28)
                              the syntax of verbs                                 639  (4)   dárdi l7la d-àyya.} ‘My suffering is not from this.’ (A26:66)
  (5)   lˆwa yóm6t šáb°a.} ‘It was not Saturday.’ (A14:58)
  (6)   ""ína l7wa mèdre gnàyux.} ‘But it was not your fault again.’ (A1:25)15.3.8. The Existential Particles
The existential particle ""i°, together with its variant forms (§8.20.1.),
expresses either a permanent (1–3) or a contingent (4–6) situation:  (1)   ""í°6n xa-†ùra.} ‘There is a mountain.’ (A24:11)
  (2)   ""í°6n biš-gù‰e mènni.} ‘There are better men than me.’ (A26:79)
  (3)   ""ítli ðá brat6t-màma.} ‘I have a cousin.’ (A7:17)
  (4)   ""í°6n tàma} †è¬¬6° bná°a xène.} ‘There are there three other girls.’
        (A26:24)
  (5)   ""ána ""í° šùla qámi.} ‘There is work in front of me (to do).’ (A24:45)
  (6)   ""ítli xákma xabráne t-amrênn6x.} ‘I have a few words to say to you.’
        (A4:40)The existential particle is sometimes combined with the deictic copula,
e.g.  (7)  hóla ""í°6n jênne gáwa!} ‘There are jinn in it!’ (A22:33)
  (8)  hóle ""í°6n xà} k6s-tòto} sàwta.} ‘There is somebody at the home of the
       old woman.’ (A24:44)
  (9) qam-""árya hóle ""ì°6n} gêlla.} ""u-qam-""èzza hóle ""ì°6n} bêsra.} šqúl bêsra} m-qam-
       ""êzza} dríle qam-""àrya.} ""u-gêlla} šqúlle m-k6s-""àrya} drìle} qa-""êzza.} ‘Before
       the lion there is grass and before the she-goat there is meat. Take
       the meat from before the goat and put it before the lion. Take the
       grass from the lion and offer it to the she-goat.’ (A24:15)
  (10) qàwra} ""í°6n xa-káwe gàwa} ""u-hóle ""í°6n jawêtta,} jawètt6t práma qˆse.} ""i-
       q7ma xa-dalí°6t xùwwe} ""i-x8ða l-án tre-xoriyà°a.} kút ""ás6q qamáya xazéla
       ""5-dalí°a brì°6ll-ani} parêmla.} ‘There is a hole in the grave. There is a
       chopper, a chopper to cut wood. A wild vine grows up and winds
       around those two willow trees. The first to see the vine growing
       on those (trees) cuts it down.’ (A26:91)
  (11) hóle ""í°6n bóya zòra.} ‘There is a small hole.’ (A20:5)
  (12) hóle ""í°6n làxxa} stêrra.} ‘There is here a storeroom.’ (A23:17)These examples express both contingent (7–9) and permanent (10–12)
situations. The crucial conditioning factor for the use of the deictic copula
640                           chapter fifteenis not the nature of the situation expressed by the predicate, but rather
the discourse prominence that the speaker wishes to give to the referent
introduced by the clause. In (7) the force of the deictic copula is to express
the unexpectedness of the existence of jinn. In the remaining examples
the referent introduced plays a prominent role in the ensuing discourse.
In (8) the man at the home of the old woman is the protagonist of the
following narrative. In (9) the grass and the meat are in the centre of
attention in what follows. In (10) the deictic copula is used with the clause
introducing the ‘chopper’ but not in the one introducing the ‘hole’ in the
grave. It is the activity associated with the chopper that is the concern of
the following discourse, as shown in the cited example, whereas the ‘hole’
is only an incidental referent. In (11) and (12) the referent introduced acts
as the spatial setting for the following section of discourse.
    The past existential particle (""i°wa) and the negative existential particle
(li°, li°wa) are, likewise, used to express a permanent (13–15) or contingent
(16–18) situation. They are not, however, combined with the deictic copula:  (13) ""í°wa xa-màlka.} ‘There was a king.’ (A1:2)
  (14) lì°6n d>ràje,} ta-ßáli gu-gòma.} ‘There are not steps for them to go
       down into the basement stable.’ (A22:10)
  (15) ""7-ga lí°wa bêrqa.} ‘At that time there was not electricity.’ (B10:45)
  (16) ""í°wa bráta dmíxta kèsle dìye.} ‘There was a girl sleeping with him.’
       (A26:6)
  (17) lí° ""áp-xa gu-bˆ°a?} ‘Is there nobody in the house?’ (A22:32)
  (18) lì°wale qußàrta.} ‘He did not have a cooking-pot.’ (A5:1)The noun that is introduced by an existential particle may refer to a
specific item, as in the majority of the examples above, or to a class (18).
Further examples of constructions with class nouns:  (19) ""í°6n bê†ma.} ‘There is the terebinth tree.’ (B5:220)
  (20b) ""í°wa ""9raq.} ‘There was arak.’ (B5:11)
  (21) ""í°wa lèxma y-amrèxwa zeðàye.} ‘There was bread that we called
        zeðaye.’ (B5:15)
  (22) ""í°wa xyápt6t xêtna.} ‘There was the washing of the groom.’
        (B5:25)There is no clear functional distinction between the short and long vari-
ants of the existential particles. They appear to be in free variation. In
                             the syntax of verbs                                641a series of two parallel clauses containing the particles, however, a short
variant is often followed by a long variant, giving the final clause of the
pair end-weighting, e.g.  (23) xùy5le,} púrya lì°,} b6rqa lì°6n.} ‘It is dark. There is no light and there
       is no electricity.’ (A23:29)
  (24) ‘ù-qala lí°.} ‘ú-qala lí°6n m6nnèy.} ‘There is no sound. There is no
       sound of them.’ (A18:15)On many occasions the present existential particles (""i°, li°) occur in the
context of past form verbs and have past tense reference, sharing their
deictic centre with these verbs.  (25) qímela xìlela.} qímela šqílela xa-""amána xàn‘i zóra.} mútt6lla k6s-réša dìya.}
       ßáw°a lì°6n.} ‘They ate. Then they took a small container and put
       it at her head. There was no speech (with this).’ (A21:17–18)
  (26) mútt6lla gu-""a†nàb6l} ""u-nùbl6lla.} ""áw ""ítle ða-""ót6x ""ax-d-àyya,} zùrt5la,}

       ""u-la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘They put her in a car and took her off. He had
       one room like this one, it was small, his bed and his mother’s, on
       the floor there was nothing, no chair, nothing.’ (A21:5)15.3.9. The Verb hwy
In addition to the various copulas and the existential particles, the verb
‘to be’ may be expressed by the verb hwy, which is inflected in all verbal
bases. Many of the inflections of this verb supply functions that are not
expressed by the copulas or existential particles, though in some cases
there is functional overlap.15.3.9.1. qa†6l15.3.9.1.1. Realis
The qa†6l form of hwy, without any prefixed particle, is occasionally used in
a realis sense, referring imperfectively to a situation in the present, e.g.  (1)   ""u-zeðàya} ""íla biš-xlìmta.} xlìmta hóya.} ‘A zeðaya bread is thicker. It is
        thick.’ (B6:49)
  (2)   ""u-xàkma dukáne} xà-yoma háwe ""éða.} ‘In some places the festival is for
        one day.’ (B6:2)
642                           chapter fifteen  (3) hal-""aßèrta ""áw háwe šulˆni.} ‘This is our activity until the evening’
      (B6:11)
  (4) yóm6t ""èsri-w xámša háwe ""èða.} ‘The twenty-fifth day is the festival’
      (B6:13)
  (5) ""ína ""áyy6t xúmßa har-xúmßa háwe xwarnàya.} ‘But the dish consisting
      only of xumßa is whitish.’ (B10:16)
  (6) ""ˆ-ga} Rustám ""o-mtán5 mènne y-ámri ""7-g6 damêxwa,} †¬a°à yomá°a} ""u-†¬a°à
      l5l>wá°a háwe dmìxa.} ‘Now, they say of Rustam that when he slept,
      he would be asleep for three days and three nights.’ (A29:2)
  (7) har-dmáxta dìy6n} biz-zóda gu-b5°wà°a hóya.} ‘Our sleeping is mostly
      in the houses.’ (B15:27)
  (8) qedámta hál bar-kawù°ra} šèmša y-óya bà°6r †úra,} fa-†êlla háwe} qam-†ùra.}
      ‘In the morning, until after lunch, the sun is behind the mountain
      and there is shade at the front of the mountain.’ (B3:2)These examples exhibit differences regarding the referential status of the
subject and the nature of the predicate. They may be divided into three
categories.  (i) In (1)–(5) the subject has generic reference and the predicate denotes
        a permanent situation.
  (ii) In (6) the subject has a specific referent and the predicate refers to
        a habitual, iterative situation.
  (iii) In (7)–(8) the subject has generic reference and the predicate refers
        to a habitual, iterative situation.","[664, 665, 666, 667, 668, 669, 670, 671, 672, 673, 674, 675, 676, 677, 678, 679, 680, 681]"
"15.8.1. Continuity
(i) When it has the sense of ‘remaining’, it can be used absolutely, without
any complement except for an optional adverbial, e.g.  (1)   p7ši xètna-w k yálo tàma} hal-xušèba.} ‘The groom and bride stay there
        until Sunday.’ (B5:51)
  (2)   ""áwwa y-asèqwa m6n-l7le hal-""aßêrta} ""u-""èrwe p5šíwa gu-†ùra.} ‘He (the
        shepherd) would go up in the morning (and work) until evening.
        The small cattle would remain in the mountains.’ (B5:158)
  (3)   ""u-napßìwale,} qá-t ""an-rèzza la-páy6š gàwe.} ‘They shook it so that the
        rice did not remain in it.’ (B5:84)
  (4)   b8ya pˆša,} p7ša ""áy ""àxxa,} b-šóp6t bròn6n.} ‘If she wants to stay, let her
        stay here, in place of our son.’ (A4:39)A perfective past form in narrative may express a situation enduring for
a delimited period of time, e.g.
746                             chapter fifteen  (5)   píšla †¬a-yàrxe.} ‘They stayed three months.’ (A14:84)
  (6)   píš5le gu-†úra xá-yoma yóme trè.} ‘He remained in the mountains one
        or two days.’ (A4:2)In narrative the verb is sometimes used with the anaphoric adverbial
had6x ‘like this, thus’ to express a passage of time and a transition between
episodes, e.g.  (7)   šèryela gu-d-7 ""otél ""o-yòma-w} píšela hàd6x.} ""aßèrta °ì°5la} b8yi t-áxli xa-
        ràmša.} ‘They put up in the hotel that day and remained like that.
        The evening came and they wanted to eat dinner.’ (A2:2)
  (8)   ""u-xílela ""áni mêndi-w} sus>wa°éy dèry6lla mèndi ""ixàla.} píšela hàd6x.}
        ""àm6r . . . } xuláma ""ám6r †la-mìra.} ‘They ate something and gave their
        horses some food. They remained like that. The servant said to
        the master . . .’ (A26:17–18)The verb in the q†ille form may express the onset of a situation with no
definite endpoint, which is sequential to a preceding situation, e.g.  (9)  ðá-k°5°a xilàla,} ðá pìšla.} ‘He ate one chicken and one remained.’
       (A2:3)
  (10) hár šèmme píšle ’ùxo.} ‘His name still remained ’uxo (after the
       preceding event).’ (A7:4)When the subject is human, the verb can have the sense of ‘remaining
alive’, e.g.  (11) ""u-xaráye †líba díya q6m-šaqlêxle.} ""áy pìšla.} ‘In the end we took her
       betrothed but she remained alive.’ (A4:45)
  (12) káwa xoš-t-awéwa pìša.} ‘He should have remained alive.’ (A7:20)(ii) Finite inflections of pyš can be combined with an infinitive to express
the uninterrupted continuity of an event or situation over a period of
time, e.g.  (1)   ""o-bróna t-íle zíla ða-bá≥6r xèta,} yá'ni ða-mðìta,} ða-mà°a,} píšle rába
        mparòje,} maßyó°e l-b7°6t bábe dìye.} ‘The son who had gone to another
        town, that is a town, a village, remained watching intently, listening
        (for news) about his father’s family.’ (A18:12)

      weeping and weeping, one day, two, one month.’ (A4:44)
  (3) ""o-píšt5la ""an-d6bbòre} har-zála-w °àya.} ‘The bees continued to go back
      and forth.’ (A20:8)
  (4) píšla béna gráša kúll6t yóma m6n-d-o-dùša} hál ""aßêrta.} ‘All day they con-
      tinued to draw out that honey, until evening.’ (A14:15)In (5) the infinitive coming after the verb pyš is negated by the negative
copula:  (5) píšla bábe-u yèmme-u xon>wá°a lˆla h>móne.} ‘His father and mother
      and her brothers continued not to believe it.’ (A18:11)It may also be combined with a resultative participle of a stative verb to
express a similar sense, e.g.  (6) ""u-xílela ""ixàla} ""u-píše dmìxe.} ‘They ate food and remained there asleep
      (i.e. they stayed the night there).’ (A15:8)15.8.2. Ingressive
(i) When it has the sense of ‘to become’, it is combined with a complement
expressing an identity or property that is acquired by the subject, e.g.  (1) m-bár †axnìle,} páy6š qàmxa} masqíle bˆ°a.} ‘After they grind it and it
      becomes flour, they take it up to the house.’ (B5:99)
  (2) maštˆwala} qá-t xá‘‘a p7šawa rakìxta.} ‘They would irrigate it so that
      it would become rather soft.’ (B5:76)
  (3) ""ána píšli bàxtux.} ‘I have become your wife.’ (A25:65)
  (4) málla píšla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘As for the mullah, the pot became the
      mullah’s’. (A5:10)
  (5) Bárw6r píšt5la kúlla m-Záwa l-Xawóra t-là-ma°wa°a.} ‘All of Barwar, from
      the Zab to the Khabur became (a land) without villages.’ (B1:10)When an ingressive pyš is combined with a resultative participle from a
transitive verb, the construction expresses a passive action. This will be
discussed in greater detail in §15.9.3. below, e.g.
748                             chapter fifteen  (6) b-7-šeta píšla Dúre muqyàmta-w} ‘In that year Dure was evacuated.’
      (B1:8)(ii) The verb pyš with an ingressive function can be combined with an
infinitive and have the sense of beginning the action in question, e.g.  (1) ""u-táwra píšle mangóle ""áxxa l-tàmma.} ‘The ox began to limp back and
      forth.’ (A22:3)
  (2) píšt5la mtanóye ða-qêßß6t} †la-qà†u.} ‘She started telling a story to the
      cat’. (A14:2)
  (3) píšela mnáy6lla l-xà-xa.} ‘They began to count them, one by one.’
      (A6:3)
  (4) ""áyya m6škènta píšt5la mxàya} dráya qè†ma gu-réša dìya.} ‘The poor woman
      began to beat (herself ) and put ash on her head.’ (A14:22)(iii) Ingressive pyš is occasionally combined with a perfective verbal form
to convey the sense that the event in question is the final outcome of a
chain of events. This is the case in (1), where it is combined with a per-
fective future qa†6l form:  (1) bas-tàma} qèßß6t dìy6x} ""u-t-xòn6x} p7ša mà†ya} l-xarayú°a dìya.} ‘There your
      story and that of your brother will (finally) reach its end.’ (A8:88)A similar function is sometimes performed by a construction in which pyš is
combined with the resultative participle of a telic intransitive verb, e.g.  (2) tíwela tàma} ""u-xílela ""ixàla} ""u-píše dmìxe.} ‘They sat there, ate food, then
      (in the end) went to sleep.’ (A15:8)(iv) Ingressive pyš is sometimes used in narrative before expressions of
time to mark the beginning of a new episodic section. It may be used to
denote the onset of a point in time, e.g.  (1) píšle yòma} hár wewa-xðàra.} ‘Day came and he was still searching
      about.’ (A14:24)
  (2) píšt5la ""aßêrta.} gu-sá""6t ""èšta ""aßèrta šáwwa gu-gn7°6t yòma,} hóle °éle ’ùxo,}
      xa-bèrra ""èrwe bà°re.} ‘The evening came. At six or seven o’clock in
      the evening, at dusk, ’uxo came, with a flock of sheep following
      him.’ (A7:21)
  (3) píšta mbàdla.} mbádla qìm5le.} ‘Morning came. In the morning he got
      up.’ (A14:66)
                            the syntax of verbs                              749In (1)–(3) above the expression of time can be construed as the grammatical
subject of the verb. The expression of time may also be a prepositional
phrase, as in (4). Here the grammatical subject of the verb, which is 3fs.,
must be impersonal:  (4) píšla b-lˆle,} sìq5le} l-gàre.} ‘At night he went up onto the roof.’
      (A25:52)The verb pyš may also be used to denote the passage of an interval of time.
In such contexts it has 3ms or 3fs inflection. The time expression appears
not to be construed as the grammatical subject, judging by constructions
such as (7), in which a 3ms. verb is followed by a feminine nominal phrase,
and (8), where a 3fs. verb is followed by a masculine nominal phrase:  (5) píš5le xà-yarxa} málka xzéle xa-xèlma xèna.} ‘A month later the king had
      another dream.’ (A1:9)
  (6) píšle šènne rábe ""árbe xámm6š ""èšš6t šènne la-zìlle.} ‘For many years, four,
      five six years, he did not go there.’ (A18:12)
  (7) píš5le ða-šáb°a xˆta,} ""ám6r †la-báxta . . . ‘A week later, he said to his
      wife . . .’ (A5:8)
  (8) p5šáwa xa-yóma trè,} hál barêzwa.} ‘One or two days would go by until
      it became dry.’ (B5:167)
                  15.9. The Expression of the PassiveVarious constructions are used to express the passive of a transitive
verb.15.9.1. q†il
The dialect exhibits a vestigial use of the past base stem q†il to express a
passive action. This is only used sporadically and is restricted to the 3rd
person. As is the case with the q†ille form, the q†il form expresses a specific
event occurring in the past at a particular point in time, e.g.  (1) mèra prúmu rèše!} ""áwwa prìm réše.} ‘She said “Cut off his head!” He—his
      head was cut off.’ (A24:31)
  (2) bá°6r t-gníw Mar-Qayòma,} q6m-dawríle t9ra.} ‘After (the church of ) St.
      Qayoma was plundered, they closed the door.’ (D2:66)
750                             chapter fifteen  (3) mó°i júlla dìya.} ‘Her clothes were brought.’ (A4:20)
  (4) brátux mù°ya.} ‘Your daughter has been brought back.’ (A29:42)
  (5) ""áy wela-""á-bráta xar7°6t m†úmra gu-Dùre.} ‘That was the last girl who
      was buried in Dure.’ (B1:12)
  (6) ""ína ""an-tre-xéne píšela hál-dan6t t-íxwa ""áxni tàma,} hál-šèt ""álpa ""6óóá-mma-
      w šáwwi tmànya,} ""íman t-moqìma Dúre.} ‘But the other two remained
      until the time that we were there, until the year 1978, when Dure
      was evacuated.’ (B1:5)There are other signs of the fossilization of this construction in addition
to the extreme infrequency of its use. The 3ms. form q†il can be used also
with 3fs. and 3pl. nominal subjects:  gaw‰a q†il                ‘The man was killed’
  baxta q†ila ~ q†il        ‘The woman was killed’
  naše q†ili ~ q†il         ‘The people were killed’Example from the text corpus:  (7) prim-""êrwe.} ‘Sheep were slaughtered.’ (B10:40)If the agent of the action is expressed in the clause by a nominal phrase,
this is not necessarily introduced by any preposition, e.g.  (8) mú°y6lla qaráw6t dìya} mùtt6lla.} b7°a dwìq} qaráw6t dìya.} ‘They brought
      her bed and laid it down. The house was filled by her bed.’
      (A21:7)Both these features reflect a certain degree of opacity regarding the status
of the patient argument as the grammatical subject of the verb. Lack of
agreement of a verb with its grammatical subject would not in principle
be possible elsewhere in the verbal system, but lack of agreement with
a grammatical object would be permissible, especially with indefinite
nominals as in (7). The lack of the preposition on the agent nominal in
examples such as (8) is a property of a grammatical subject, suggesting
that it is competing for this status with the patient nominal.

As has been discussed in §15.4.1.1., the resultative participle of a transi-
tive verb combined with the copula, or with the suppletive verb hwy, can
express the passive. It denotes the result of a past verbal event without
referring directly to any specific event that brought about this result. The
construction has an inherent ambiguity in that in many contexts the par-
ticiple may have a dynamic verbal interpretation or a stative adjectival
interpretation, e.g.  (1)   xuwwe q†ìl5le!} ‘The snake has been killed / the snake is killed!’
        (A24:42)
  (2)   ""án baxtá°a barzanáye mêra} kˆla ""an-gúre xéne?} mère kúlla hóla q†ìle.} ‘The
        Barzan women said “Where are the other men?” He said “They
        have all been killed / They are all killed.” ’ (B19:8)
  (3)   bróni hóle xíla ""6dlˆle.} ‘My son has been eaten tonight.’ (A18:2)
  (4)   yába ‘ídetu xlúl6 bròn-fèll6n b-flàn-yoma.} ‘You have been invited / you
        are invited to the wedding of the son of so-and-so on such-and-
        such a day.’ (B5:21)
  (5)   kúl má°a t-íla tlíxta ""í° ""ùmra gáwa.} ‘Every village that has been / is
        destroyed and has a church in it’ (B6:34)
  (6)   párša t-wéwa mútta b-r6š-Xuldêkka.} ‘A flat stone that had been placed /
        was placed on top of Xuld6kko’ (A51:20)The agent may be expressed in such passive resultative constructions. This
is usually marked by the preposition l-, e.g.  (7)  ""6n-réš6t bábe díye ""ax-†ùra,} ""u-hóle q†íla l-T>tár-i Slemán-i Sêndi,} lˆka
       bt-áz6l?} ‘If the head of his father is like a mountain and he has been
       killed by T>tar-i Sleman-i S6ndi, where will he go?’ (A28:8)
  (8) šáwwa°na hóla xíle l-dèwa.} ‘The seven of them have been eaten by
       wolves.’ (A23:15)
  (9) xabúša smóqa l-dêbb5le xíla.} ‘The red apple has been eaten by the
       bear.’ (D2:65)
  (10) nísa l-xúwwe m-xàwla ßádle.} ‘He who has been bitten by a snake is
       afraid of a rope.’ (D2:39)
  (11) ‘íd6t l-bràtux.} ‘You have been invited by your daughter.’ (A40:12)
  (12) xá°ux Nasímo jlíwt5la l-""arabàye.} ‘Your sister Nasimo has been kid-
       napped by Arabs.’ (A37:5)
752                            chapter fifteen  (13) mxuzd5w6n l-Tom6n xali. ‘I have been shamed by Toman my uncle.’
       (A52:4)On fronted agents in focus bearing the nuclear stress the preposition is
sometimes omitted, which results in an opacity of coding, in that both
the patient nominal and the agent nominal have the coding appropriate
for the grammatical subject, e.g.  (14) ""áyya yalêxta} bàbila zqírta} ""u-xá°i Nasìmola mnuqášta.} ‘This hand-
       kerchief was woven by my father and embroidered by my sister
       Nasimo.’ (A37:12)15.9.3. Resultative Participle Combined with pyš
The most productive means of forming the passive of a transitive verb is
by combining a form of the verb pyš with the resultative participle. The
tense and aspect of the construction are determined by the form of pyš.
It is frequently used in historical narratives with a perfective aspect to
refer to a specific event in the past. In such cases the verb pyš is in the
q†ille form or the q†il5l5 form, which here is used in its narrative sense of
a preterite equivalent to q†ille, e.g.  (1)   rába m6n-d-ánna ma°wà°a} píšla prìme} . . . píšla q†ìle.} ""u-píšla mšuxèlpe
        ma°wá°6t qurðáye muš6lmàne.} ‘Many (of the inhabitants of) these
        villages were slaughtered. . . . They were killed. They (the villages)
        were then changed into Muslim Kurdish villages.’ (B1:2)
  (2)   b-7-šeta píšla Dúre muqyàmta-w} kúlla má°wa°6t Bˆrw6r,} sáma zóda
        t-ma°wà°a,} píšla moqìme,} ""u-tlìxe,} ""umráne tlìxe,} ""u-bustanáne mùqðe,}
        ""u-má°a šwíqta x>ràba-w} náše †rìðe.} ‘In that year Dure was evacuated.
        All the villages of Barwar, or most of the villages, were evacuated
        and destroyed. The churches were destroyed, the orchards were
        burnt, the village was left a ruin and the people were driven away.’
        (B1:8)
  (3)   ""í°wal6n šawwá ""abòne} gu-má°a dìy6n.} píšela mútte gu-Mar-Qayyóma kúlla
        gu-ðà qáwra.} ‘We had seven bishops in our village. They were all
        laid in one grave in (the church of) Saint Qayyoma.’ (B2:6)If a nominal expressing the agent is mentioned in the clause it is intro-
duced by the preposition l-, e.g.
                            the syntax of verbs                              753  (4) ""u-Dùre} píšt5la muqyàmta} muxràwta} šawwà gáye} l-xànpe} qa†òle}
      t-muš6lmàne.} ‘Dure was evacuated and destroyed seven times by
      pagan murderers of Muslims.’ (B2:2)Constructions with a past perfective of pyš such as pišle q†ila or its equiva-
lent in narrative piš5le q†ila correspond in function to the obsolescent q†il
form.
   In (5) the resultative participle of pyš is combined with the past copula:  (5) ""éða gó‰a ""íle xa-†ùxsa} qyámt6t Mšíxa bá°6r t-wéwa píša q†ìla.} ‘The Great
      Festival is a ceremony (commemorating) the resurrection of Christ
      after he had been killed.’ (B6:1)In (6) a future form of pyš is used, in (7)–(8) an irrealis form and in (9) a
past habitual form:  (6) kú nêšma} t-mà†ya} r6š-gèšr6t Dalàle} ""5-nèšma b6d-pˆša} prìmta,} q†ìlta.}
      ‘Any soul that comes onto the bridge of Dalale—that soul will be
      slaughtered, killed.’ (C8:5)
  (7) yába ""ána t-à°6n,} ""áx‘i ""6n-yáwul Ä>m?n} š∞x} ""áwwa †éni páy6š n†ìra} ta-
      t-‘ú-mdi là-""a°e bíye dìye.} ‘Well, I’ll come, only if the sheikh gives a
      guarantee that this saddle bag will be guarded so that nothing will
      happen to it.’ (A7:9)
  (8) kúl-xa náša . . . yalúnka zór6t bàre} g8r6g páy6š m5mèðða gu-""ùmra.} ‘Every-
      body . . . when a young child is born, he must be baptized in the
      church.’ (B6:9)
  (9) hadíya mtánexi xa-tuní°a ""atìqta} p5šáwa mtun7°a gu-ma°wà°a.} ‘Now we
      shall tell an old story, which used to be told in the villages.’Constructions with the resultative forms of pyš such as hole piša q†ila / piš5le
q†ila ‘He has been killed / He is killed’ and piš5wa q†ila ‘He had been killed /
He was killed’ are equivalent in function to the passive resultative forms
hole q†ila / q†il5le and q†il5wa. The difference is that forms with pyš can only
function as passives whereas the forms with the copula could in principle
have a passive or active interpretation according to context. Speakers use
the constructions with pyš to eliminate this opacity of diathesis. In (10)
the motivation for using the unambiguously passive form pišewa ‘ide may
have been to distinguish it clearly from the active form ‘5diwaley in the
immediately preceding discourse:
754                             chapter fifteen  (10) kúlla ma°wá°a ‘5dìwaley.} m6n-kúlla ma°wá°6 t-íla marzabán6t ""Ón-Nùne,}
       xa-tmánya ""6ßrà-ma°wa°a} náše píšewa ‘ìde.} ‘They invited all the vil-
       lages. From all the villages that were adjacent to ""“n-Nune, eight
       or ten villages, the people were invited.’ (B15:61)Occasionally pyš is used with the resultative participle of intransitive verbs.
Such constructions are used to convey the sense that the subject refer-
ent is non-volitional and the event is caused to take place by an external
agent. This is in conformity with the pyš q†ila passive construction, which
in principle has a non-volitional subject who is the undergoer of the
action. In (11), for example, the construction pišla riqe is used to express
the fact that the inhabitants of the villages were forced to flee against their
will. The ‘active’ form riqla ‘they fled’, by contrast, would in principle be
interpreted as having a volitional subject.  (11) rába m6n-d-ánna ma°wà°a} píšla prìme} ""u-xákma píšla rìqe-u} píšla q†ìle.}
       ‘Many (of the inhabitants of ) these villages were slaughtered. Some
       (were forced to) flee and were killed.’ (B1:2)15.9.4. Resultative Participle Combined with ""°y
On some sporadic occasions the passive is expressed by a construction
consisting of a finite form of the verb ""°y ‘to come’ with the undergoer
as subject and a resultative participle, e.g.  (1)   b-r6š-d-àyya bráta} réš6t bábe díye t-Zàlo} °éle twíra ràbe gáye.} ‘On account
        of this girl, the head of his father Zàl was broken many times.’
        (A29:39)15.9.5. Infinitive Combined with ""°y
In another type of periphrastic construction the verb ""°y ‘to come’ is
combined with the infinitive of the verbal stem that expresses the action.
This construction is of more restricted use than that the pyš + resultative
participle construction. In most of the recorded examples the verb is
negated. The infinitive may be preceded by the preposition l-, e.g.  (1)   har-Dúre lˆ-""a°ya l-manšóye.} ‘Dure will never be forgotten.’ (B2:7)
  (2)   ""u-hál hadíya ""áwwa m6ndiyáne píšela l-bàl6n} ""u-lˆ-""a°i l-manšóye.} ‘Until
        now these things remain in my mind and will not be forgotten.’

  (4) lá-kulla danáne kúlla †awalyá°a t-a°íwa m†awòle.} ‘Not all games would
      be played at all times.’ (B11:1)
  (5) ""á°e maxròpe.} ‘It is sharpened.’ (B11:17)In (6) the instrument of the action is introduced by the preposition b-:  (6) ""ána hon-màra} ""áwwa rèši} t-á°e xá-yoma pràma} b6d-""i°á°a dìyux.} ‘I say
      that this head of mine will one day be cut off by your hands.’
      (A14:35)The construction may be used deontically to express deontic possibility
or obligation, e.g.  (7) ""áy q6ßßètta rìxt5la.} la-""á°ya l-mtanòye.} ‘It is a long story. It cannot be
      told.’ (A25:52)
  (8) mèra mòdi qèßß6t?} tànil5ni!} mère là} l5-""á°ya mtanòye} xàf náše šmà""6ll5ni.}
      ‘They said “What is the story? Tell us!” He said “No. It cannot/must
      not be told, lest people are listening.” ’ (A35:10–11)15.9.6. Unaccusative Intransitive Verbs
Numerous verbal forms exhibit an alternation of transitive and unaccu-
sative intransitive usage. These can be used transitively with a volitional
subject and an object complement that is the undergoer of the action or
alternatively can be used intransitively with the non-volitional undergoer
being made the grammatical subject. They are found in all verb stems
(for a set of such verbs in stem III see §8.17.2.).
   The translation equivalent in English may be a verb that exhibits a
similar alternation, e.g.     ""áw šmí†le kupàle.} ‘He broke his stick.’
     ""o-kupála šmì†le.} ‘The stick broke.’
     ""áw ßlíxle qˆsa.} ‘He split the wood.’
     ""o-q7sa ßlìxle.} ‘The wood split.’
     núra q6m-qaméla ßùdri.} ‘The fire scorched my shirt.’
     ßúdri qmèla.} ‘My shirt scorched.’
756                            chapter fifteen      ""áni q6m-xanqìle.} ‘They drowned him.’
      ""áw xnìqle.} ‘He drowned.’
      ""áw mkuwèrre ""9raq} ‘He distilled arak’
      ""8raq mkuwêrra.} ‘The arak distilled.’
      ""áw mukíšle gùða.} ‘He deflated the skin.’
      gúða mukìšle.} ‘The skin deflated.’In some cases the transitive alternative must be translated by supplying
the matrix verb ‘to cause’ or a different lexical item, e.g.      ""áw mujrè†le yàla.} ‘He caused the child to slip.’
      ""o-yála mujrê†le.} ‘The child slipped.’
      ""áw †ríxle nàša.} ‘He caused the man to lie flat.’
      ""o-náša †rìxle.} ‘The man lay down flat.’
      ""áw tlíxle bˆ°a.} ‘He destroyed the house.’
      ""o-b7°a tlìxle.} ‘The house collapsed.’In many cases an unaccusative intransitive alternative of a transitive
verb is rendered idiomatically by an English passive. This applies, for
example, to the verbs q†a""a ‘to cut’, šqala ‘to take’, which are normally
used transitively:  (1) m6n-êdyo} malkù°a} m-bnónux q9†a.} ‘From today the kingship will be
      cut off from your sons.’ (A8:96)
  (2) mðíta b>yènna mbádla jálde kúlla ""ax-qamàye,} muxwàrta.} ""áwwa kóma šàq6l.}
      ‘(By) early morning I want all the town as (it was) before, made
      white. Let the black be taken away.’ (A4:34)Numerous other verbs exhibit this alternation, e.g.      g6lyále duzù°a.} ‘He revealed the truth.’
      duzú°a glèla.} ‘The truth was revealed.’
      páwxa q6m-mbalbèlle kàwse.} ‘The wind ruffled his hair.’
      káwse mbulbèlle qam-pàwxa.} ‘His hair was ruffled by the wind.’
      máw°6t mámi q6m-mzarzèli.} ‘The death of my uncle shook me.’
      mzurzèli.} ‘I was shaken.’
                             the syntax of verbs                            757      q6m-qa†èrre gêšra.} ‘He complete the arch of the bridge.’
      gèšra q†êrre.} ‘The arch of the bridge was completed.’
      ß†imlux bˆ°i.} ‘You have devastated my house.’
      ""ána ß†ìmli.} ‘I am devastated.’
      burb6zíli zùze.} ‘I scattered the money.’
      zúze burbêzla.} ‘The money was scattered.’
      q6m-mxa°xè°la x6zmayù°a.} ‘He renewed the family relationship.’
      x6zmayú°a mxu°xêtla.} ‘The family relationship was renewed.’The alternations described above are not restricted to past pefective forms,
as in the examples above, but apply also to forms with present or future
time reference and imperfective aspect.
   Even when an unaccusative intransitive usage is available, a transitive
verb is sometimes made intransitive by the pyš q†ila construction, e.g.   (3) ""ína kupáli píšla šmì††a} ""u-piláwe píšla šmì†e.} ‘But my staff has broken
       and my shoes have broken.’ (A37:17)15.9.7. Diathesis of Causative Verbs
Causative forms of transitive verbs exhibit alternating diathesis. These
may either take as their grammatical object the agent of the action that
is being caused with the undergoer expressed as a second object or alter-
natively may take the undergoer of the action as the only grammatical
object, e.g.q†ala ‘to kill’:     maq†ole ‘to cause to kill’   (1) q6m-maq†èlli xàwri.} ‘He [AGENT1] caused me [AGENT2] to kill my
       friend [UNDERGOER].’
   (2) q6m-maq†èlle xàwri.} ‘He [AGENT1] caused my friend [UNDER-
       GOER] to be killed.’When the grammatical object is the undergoer, as in (2), the caused action
is presented with passive diathesis. The agent who is caused to perform
the action need not be specified. If it is specified, it must be expressed
in a prepositional phrase, as is the case in (4), unless it is a reflexive con-
struction (5):
758                                chapter fifteen  (3) bàxta} be-b9x6t-ila.} maq6†làle gáw‰a.} ‘A woman is treacherous. She will
      cause her husband to be killed.’ (A26:2)
  (4) ""áwwa náša sáwa †la-mó q6m-maq6†lètle bìyi?} ‘Why did you cause that
      old man to be killed by me?’ (A15:18)
  (5) tre-†¬á-gaye mamxêxwala gán6n.} ‘We used to cause ourselves to be struck
      two or three times.’ (B5:84)15.9.8. Diathesis of Infinitives
An infinitive of a transitive verb that is subordinate to a matrix verb can
have active or passive diathesis. Examples of infinitives presented with
passive diathesis are (1)–(4), in which the agents of the action denoted by
the infinitive are not specified:  (1) °í°5la xa-bràta} mxáya ßáwla díya darmàna.} ‘A girl came in order for
      her shoes to be rubbed with polish.’ (A16:2)
  (2) muttúla ""ixála xàla.} ‘They served food to be eaten.’ (A15:11)
  (3) ""áni kúlla b>yíwa maxóle ""u-maštòye.} ‘They all needed to be fed and
      given drink.’ (B16:62)
  (4) ""u-l5w6x naše t-manxope. ‘We are not people to be shamed.’ (C1:14)15.9.9. Impersonal 3pl. Subject
When the agent of a transitive action is not specified, an active verb may
be given a 3pl. impersonal subject. Such constructions are often translated
idiomatically into English as passives, e.g.  (1) q6m-†arðíli m6n-bˆ°a.} ‘They drove me from the house = I was driven
      from the house.’
  (2) gu-Zàxo} bnáya w7wa xa-gêšra.} ‘In Zakho they were building a bridge
      (= a bridge was being built).’ (C8:1–2)
  (3) ""u-har-b6nyàla xá-gaya xéta.} ‘They have already built it (the village of
      Dure) again (= It has already been built again).’ (B2:7)
  (4) Qa†ina x6tn5le t-la-mbarxile. ‘Qa†ina is a groom without them wedding
      him (= without being wed).’ (A50:15)
  (5) be-palge sarxi d6mma. ‘They defile its middle with blood (= Its middle
      is defiled by blood).’ (A52:22)This use of an impersonal 3pl. subject is common in naming expressions
with the verb ""mr ‘to say’, e.g.
                             the syntax of verbs                               759  (6) ""áxni y-amríl6n be-Hˆdo ""áxni.} ‘We—they call us (= we are called) the
      house of H5do.’ (B4:7)
         15.10. Verbal Constructions with the Particle HEŠ15.10.1. heš in Positive Clauses
The particle heš, which is of Kurdish origin, is used to modify the verbal
predicate in various ways. In positive clauses heš is used with the sense of
‘still’, expressing the persistence of an enduring situation. The form of
the verb is one that can express such a situation, e.g.  (1) ""áy heš-hóla gu-gòma.} ‘She is still in the basement stable.’ (A18:22)
  (2) héš xúya xùy5le.} ‘It is still very dark.’ (A30:36)
  (3) heš-hóle plàxa.} ‘He is still working.’
  (4) heš-hóle dmìxa.} ‘He is still asleep’.
  (5) heš-máße jàw6j.} ‘He can still move.’It may also be used with a verb expressing the persistence of an iterative
situation, e.g.  (6) ""áw náša sàw5le,} bás heš-y-áz6l šúla kùt-yum.} ‘He is an old man, but
      he still goes to work every day’.15.10.2. heš + Negator
When the particle heš precedes a negator, the construction denotes the
persistence of a negated situation and the sense of ‘not yet’. This is in
principle used with the negative copula or with a negated form of a verb
that expresses an enduring or iterative situation. These are most commonly
compound constructions with the resultative participle or infinitive, all of
which express an enduring negated situation. It is generally cliticized to
the negator and is often contracted to the form š-, e.g.  (1) heš-l7le làxxa.} ‘He is not here yet.’
  (2) heš-l7le ""ê°ya.} ‘He has not come yet.’
  (3) xalwála-w ""ap-xá‘‘a xéna šóqa †la-mòja.} qá-t ""ap-""áw zòr5le,} sab-qá-t š-l7wa
      mšúrya xála gêlla.} ‘Then she milks it and leaves a little more for the
      calf. This is because it is small and had not yet started to eat grass.’
      (B5:175)
760                             chapter fifteen  (4) ""è°y5la ""àrye.} ""ê°ye,} ""ê°ye,} š-l7wa mè†ye ""6lle-dìye.} ‘The lions came. They
      came, but they had not yet reached him.’ (A18:26)It may be used with infinitive constructions in subordinate clauses that
lack the copula. In such cases the infinitive is often negated by the particle
t-la ‘without’, e.g.  (5) q6m-dári ""an-dáwwe heš-t-là bráza.} ‘They have poured out the dawwe
      while it is not yet dry.’ (B14:1)
  (6) l7ðeti ""àyya} t-íla m6n-hèš t-la-bràya} ""áyya ""íla yíwta qa-dìyi?} ‘Don’t you
      know that she has been betrothed to me since before she was born?’
      (A25:39)
  (7) š-lá-praqa ""o-pék dìye} ""o-xáwri hád6x gabbàra,} xáz6x wírre gawàye.} ‘Before
      my friend, a huge man, had finished his measure (of whiskey), we
      saw him go inside.’ (B15:58)15.10.3. Negator + heš
When the negator precedes the particle, it has the sense of ‘no longer’,
in that it expresses the end of an enduring or iterative situation that was
previously in existence. It is attested with qa†6l base forms expressing the
end of an iterative situation in the future. The sequence la-heš generally
contracts to leš, l5š, laš or l6š, e.g.  (1) léš-""a°6x hayorêxlux.} ‘We shall no longer come to help you.’ (A48:6)
  (2) qìm5le,} mêÄya} ""u-wíða tawq≈' ""u-kúl m6ndì,} qá-t ""áyya leš-dáre bas-dìya.}
      ‘He signed and authorized it, and so forth, (pledging) that he would
      never again talk about it.’ (A8:97)
  (3) leš-faydál6x qá†l6t gàn6x.} ‘It will no longer be of any use to you to kill
      yourself.’ (A38:16)It is found with the qa†6l form of the verb mßy ‘to be able’, used with
habitual aspect and with future reference, e.g.  (4) sab-""6n-wèle šxánta ràba,} léš-maß6t ""atw6t †¬a°à-metre} rè˙qa m6n-ßùpa.} ‘For
      if it has become very hot, you can no longer sit three metres from
      the stove.’ (B15:25)
  (5) léš-maße-náša palè†le qále dìye.} ‘A person can no longer utter his voice.’
      (B15:39)
  (6) ""áql6t sus7xu ""6n-píšla kèpa,} léš maßítu jawjìtu.} ‘If the legs of your horses
      have become stone, you will no longer be able to move.’ (A8:28)
                            the syntax of verbs                           761When the construction is used with the negative copula, the particle heš is
inserted between the negator la and the copula, viz. la-heš-ile, e.g.  (7)   léš-ile gu-bˆ°a.} ‘He is no longer in the house.’In the text corpus this is attested in compound verbal forms consisting of
the copula and the resultative participle or infinitive, e.g.  (8)  mo-t-àw6ð?} léš-ile mêßya.} ‘What can he do? He can no longer do
       anything.’ (A8:96)
  (9) l7š-in xzàya,} lán-mßaya jwàja.} ‘I can no longer see and I cannot
       walk.’ (A24:2)
  (10) láš-it ðà""6lli?} ‘Don’t you know me any more?’ (A12:65)
  (11) láš-iyewa mßáya x9yewa.} ‘He could no longer make a living.’
       (A30:1)In (12) the particle is used in a compound infinitive construction in which
the copula has been omitted:  (12) léš-awwa mßáya má†e ‘ù-duk°a.} ‘He can no longer reach any place.’
       (A37:14)
         15.11. Verbal Constructions with the Particle HARThe particle har is combined with verbs to perform numerous functions.
These functions can be classified broadly into two opposing semantic
domains, viz. extension and narrowing.","[784, 785, 786, 787, 788, 789, 790, 791, 792, 793, 794, 795, 796, 797, 798, 799, 800]"

tive verb, but it is appropriate to supply them in an English translation.
Such zero object anaphora tends to be used when the speaker presents
the clause as denoting an action that is closely related to what precedes,
belonging together with it as part of the same overall event, e.g.
772                               chapter fifteen  (8)  ""a-másta marˆla.} mátti š-nùra-w} šáxna-w d7r5 marˆ°a.} ‘They congeal

When the object is a nominal, it is not usually combined with any
object marker, but the verb frequently has a pronominal object that is
co-referential with it. The occurrence of this pronominal object agree-
ment is conditioned primarily by the status of the object nominal, the
usual situation being that a definite object nominal has object agree-
ment whereas an indefinite one lacks it. The distribution of the object
agreement is also affected by the pragmatic relation of the nominal to
the other elements in the clause and the status of the clause within the
surrounding discourse.","[810, 811, 812]"
"17.8.1.2. Resumptive Element
The extraposed constituent is generally resumed in the clause by a
pronominal suffix. The suffix may be on the verb (1), a noun (2) or a
preposition (3):  (1) ""áw y-amríle xêppo.} ‘That—they call it a x6ppo.’ (B5:35)
  (2) ""ána x7li hóle gu-xa-q7sa xèna.} ‘I—my strength is in another piece of
      wood.’ (A12:39)
  (3) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome.} ‘In our commuity a week is seven
      days.’ (A17:13)In some cases the resumptive element is an independent pronoun. In most
of the attested cases this is the subject of the clause, e.g.  (4) jawètta ""áyya t-prêzl5la.} ‘The chopper—it is (made) of iron.’ (B5:140)
  (5) ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse} ‘But a ladder—it is (made) of wood.’ (B10:60)
  (6) bas-""7ni t-xzéla ""ày xoš-""áza gu-jahànnam.} ‘Only my eye, which saw
      it—let that go to Hell.’ (A16:2)
  (7) ""o-t-íle plíxa ""àw bt-áx6l.} ‘Whoever has worked—he will eat.’ (A21:15)Occasionally the independent resumptive pronoun is the object of the
verb, e.g.  (8) táma ""áti kut-b8y6t gór6t ""àw.} ‘There anybody you like—you can marry
      him (= You can marry anybody you like).’ (A8:80)
  (9) ""í° pál†a zùrta.} ""5-zúrta ""áy zadìwala.} ‘There was (some of the tobacco)
      that came out (as) small (pieces). This small stuff—they threw that
      away.’ (B7:17)
898                          chapter seventeenThe resumptive element may even be a full nominal, e.g.  (10) málla píšla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘As for the mullah, the cooking pot
       became the mullah’s.’ (A5:10)In (11) where the extraposed element is a generic relative phrase, the
resumptive noun has an anaphoric demonstrative pronoun:  (11) kú nêšma} t-mà†ya} r6š-gèšr6t Dalàle} ""5-nèšma b6d-pˆša} prìmta,} q†ìlta.}
       ‘Any soul that comes onto the bridge of Dalale—that soul will be
       slaughtered, killed.’ (C8:5)In (12) an extraposed plural noun does not have any direct resumption,
but is linked to a singular noun in the clause in a set relationship:  (12) bàte} ""áxni qáßra díy6n mubnél6n šét6t xámši-w †¬à°a,} ""u-xámši-w ""àrpa.}
       ‘As for houses, we had our villa built in the year fifty-three and
       fifty-four.’ (B1:20)An extraposed item may be left without any explicit resumption in the
clause. In such cases the extraposed element sets the orientation of the
clause, similarly to a clause initial adverbial, without playing a syntactic
role in it.  (13) †alòbe,} béna y-oðíwa m5xòlta.} ‘As for the betrothal—they would make
       food.’ (B5:7)
  (14) m5xólta y-áwa mbúšle qawúrma-w rêzza,} ""u-k6ftàne.} ‘As for the food,
       they would have cooked qawurma, rice, meat-balls.’ (B5:15)
  (15) palá††6t ""9raq,} t-amrèxi,} y-a°7wa m5°7wa lìne ""í°wa,} d5r7wa lìne,}
       ""u-d5r7wa mìya gáwa.} ‘As for the production of arak, as we would
       say, they used to bring pots, they would put down the pots and
       put water into them.’ (B5:12)
  (16) sab-xlúla rába náše ‘5dˆwa.} ‘Because the wedding—they invited many
       people.’ (B5:23)A speaker sometimes extraposes the 1pl. independent pronoun in this way
when referring to activities in his own home or community.  (17) ""áxni b-sètwa mš7ra dúnye ràya} m6n-yárx6t ""êßra-w} xadèss6r hòd6x.} ‘We
       (= in our community)—in winter it starts raining from October
       and November onwards.’ (B5:145)
                                  the clause                                  899  (18) ""àxni} ""Ón-Núne npílta bel-†úra l-†ùra.} We—""“n-Nune is situated be-
       tween mountains.’ (B5:148)
  (19) ""áxni b7°6t be-bábi ""atìqa-wewa.} ""ína ramán5wa biš-m6n-qáßr6t kùl-
       naše.} ‘We—the house of the family of my father was old, but
       it was higher than the villas of everybody (in our community).’
       (B10:51)In (20) and (21) the resumptive independent pronoun itself stands extra-
posed from the clause:  (20) xá-naša l-xóðe lítle la-bába la-yèmma la-""àp-xa,} ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.}
       ‘A man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or any-
       body—he—they say concerning him that he has no relatives.’
       (A17:17)
  (21) xzi-""ánna †¬a-nàše} t-íla prím6lle tàwra,} †¬á°na hon-yíwt6lla mò'6d.} ‘Take
       note that the three people who slaughtered the ox—the three of
       them—I have given them an appointment.’ (A22:21)17.8.2. Function17.8.2.1. Discourse Boundary Marking
The function of the extraposition of an item at the front of a clause is
in most cases to express some kind of boundary and reorientation in the
discourse. The initial nominal expresses the topic referent of the clause,
which often has topical status also in the following clauses. When the
initial topic is given added prominence by being prosodically separated
from the rest of the clause in a different intonation group, the degree of
disjunction from what precedes is in principle enhanced. As we have seen,
subject initial clauses and ‘topic-orientated’ object initial clauses also have
a disjoining function. In these constructions also the degree of disjoining
is enhanced by the prosodic separation of the initial topical constituent.
The subject constituent may be separated from the rest of the clause by
an intonation group boundary, e.g.  (1)   šèra} xa-t6xrùny5le.} ‘The festival is a memorial.’ (B5:69)
  (2)   náša diyˆni} ""i-ß7mi †¬á yomàne.} ‘Our people fast for three days.’
        (B6:21)In copula clauses another type of prosodic separation of the initial sub-
ject topic constituent is its detachment from the copula, resulting in a
900                         chapter seventeenconstruction such as (3). Example (4) has the same structure, with the
copula after the subject, without the prosodic separation:  (3) gèrðo ""íla m6n-màsta.} ‘G6rðo is (made) of yoghurt.’ (B5:64)
  (4) xúwwele q†ìla!} ‘The snake is killed.’ (A24:42)It is worth noting that in some other NENA dialects, constructions that
correspond to (3) are extrapositional with an independent resumptive
pronoun attached to the copula, e.g. C. Qaraqosh:  (5) ""ójar ""áhu-l6 xa-mèndi d-gár6šl6 xmàra.} ‘The plough is something that
      an ass pulls.’ (Khan 2002: 412)The types of boundary that are expressed by extrapositional clauses in
the text corpus can be classified as follows:(i) Beginning of Speech
A speaker often opens a speech turn with a topic referent that is acces-
sible to the hearer. If this is not the subject of the clause, it stands in
extraposition, e.g.  (1) mère yêmmi} ""êdyo} †¬à°na} xon>wá°6t Qára Tè≥din} mopíš6lle l6bbèy.} ‘He
      said “Mother, today the three brothers of Qara Te≥din—their hearts
      became (angry).” ’ (A26:71)
  (2) mèra ""áwwa náša f>qìra} t-awéle xá bronà.} ‘They said “This poor
      man—to him will be a son (= he will have a son).” ’ (A8:3)
  (3) mère xàli} xmàre,} šáwwa°na hóla xíle l-dèwe.} ‘He said “Uncle, the
      asses—the seven of them have been eaten by wolves.” ’ (A23:15)
  (4) ßlélux xá-bena xèna?} gúrz6 šèrmux xo-""ána t-azènwa bìya?} ‘ “Have you
      come down again?” “Your stupid club (literally: the club of your
      behind)—would I have been finished off by it?” ’ (A52:17)If the subject of the clause is a possession or attribute of the speaker or
hearer, the speech turn often begins with an extraposed 1st or 2nd person
independent pronoun respectively, e.g.  (5) ""ána šèmmi ’ùxole.} ‘I—my name is ’uxo.’ (A7:18)
  (6) ""ána x7li hóle gu-xa-q7sa xèna.} ‘I—my strength is in another piece of
      wood.’ (A12:39)
                                    the clause                                      901  (7)   ""ána ""úrxi rába rìxt5la.} ‘I—my way is very long (= I have a long way
        to go).’ (A8:42)
  (8)   ""áxni ""áti xà°6n-iw6t.} ‘We—you are our sister.’ (A34:16)
  (9)   ""áti x7lux ""ˆk5le?} ‘You—where is your strength?’ (A12:38)The choice of extraposed pronoun to open the speech turn depends on
the topicality of the referent in the ensuing discourse. This is seen in (10),
in which the first clause opens with the 2s. pronoun although the gram-
matical subject is 1fs., since the following clauses are ‘hearer-orientated’,
containing various deontic expressions addressed to the hearer:  (10) ""áti ràba b>yánnux.} bas-msà'6dli xá‘‘a.} hálli xákma mêndi} masqánne l-bˆ°a}
       ""u-""aßèrta b-l7le ""á°eti kêsli.} ‘I love you a lot. Only, help me a little.
       Give me something to take up to the house and tonight come to
       me.’ (A22:19)(ii) New Section of Discourse
On some occasions a construction with an initial extraposed topic referent
occurs at the onset of a section of discourse that is disjoined in some way
from what precedes. Various types of disjunction can be identified.
    In (1) the extrapositional clause coincides with a shift in topic referent:  (1)   xíllux táma mubsêmlux.} ""ána q6m-†arðìli.} ""è°y6n m-k7rbi hon-xíl6lla ""ày.}
        ‘You ate there and enjoyed yourself. I—they drove me out and,
        out of my anger, I have come and eaten it.’ (A2:11)The construction is used when there is continuity of a topic referent from
the preceding discourse but disjunction on some other level. In narrative it
is used to signal the onset of an event section that is presented as separate
from the previous one:  (2)   ""ím6t pìdle †úra,} ßàle} ""êlt6x.} réša xtáya kúlle mêlx5le.} sùsux} ""aqlá°e mdur-
        bênnela.} mèlxa maxéla ""aqlá°e dìye,} t-áwe súsa mßarßòre.} ‘When he has
        crossed over the mountain, he will go down. Down hill it is all
        salt. Your horse—(when) its legs have become wounded, salt will
        strike his legs and he will screech.’ (A24:12)In narrative the construction is used at the onset of a section that sup-
plies some kind of elaboration on what precedes rather than carrying the
narrative forward. In (3) it presents an event that is circumstantial to the
902                          chapter seventeenpreviously mentioned event. The extrapositional clause in (4) provides an
evaluative comment on what precedes rather than an event that is pre-
sented as sequential to what precedes. In (5) the narrator opens a section
that shifts to a point earlier in the time-line and recounts the events that
led to the protagonist becoming blind.  (3) qíme dwíqe xá b-aw-rùše} xá b-aw-rùše} nùbl6lle.} ""áw lá snidíle ""áqle dìye}
      q6m-nablìle.} ‘They held him, one this shoulder and one the other,
      and took him away. His legs did not support him. They took him
      away.’ (B9:24)
  (4) qímla zrá""a xabùše.} xabúše muntéwala bíya dìya.} ‘They began to cultivate
      apples. They were successful with apples.’ (B5:75)
  (5) qám d-áyya qêßß6t} t-miràli} Dáwið kòra} dbíšla bábe-w yèmme bìye} mèra
      ""èllahi magurêxlux.} ‘Before this story that I have told you (so far), the
      blind David—his father and mother pressed him and said “By God,
      we must marry you.” ’ (A16:5)In (6)–(8), from descriptive discourse, the extrapositional construction
constitutes an explanatory supplement to what precedes:  (6) béna gu-d-á-dana m5°7wa štˆ°a.} ""a-štˆ°a} har-tàma mpal†èxwala.} ‘At
      that time they brought drink. That drink—we produced it there.’
      (B5:11)
  (7) béna y-oðíwa m5xòlta.} ""á m5xólta náš6t k yàlo y-oðíwala.} ‘They would make
      food. The food—the family of the bride would make it.’ (B5:7)
  (8) ""í°wa jawêtta.} jawètta ""áyya t-prêzl5la.} ‘There was a chopper. The
      chopper—it is (made) of iron.’ (B5:140)In (9) the construction is used in a clause that repeats the content of the
preceding clause as a strategy to introduce elaborative material:  (9) y-áz6xwa ""áxni zóre m†alèxwa kolàne.} koláne m†alêxwa gáwa.} mattèxwala
       bé""e gu-ßawêlta.} ‘We would paint eggs. We young people would go
       and play in the streets. The streets—we would play in them and
       would put eggs in a shoe.’ (B16:5)In (10) the construction coincides with a shift from a general description
of a habitual situation to the description of a specific event, which is
offered as an illustration:
                                   the clause                                   903  (10) yawíwala xà-mdi.} ""ána xmá°i xá-dawa z8ra mutt7°6lli gu-""íð6t xóni ""Ìsh6q.}
       ‘They would give her (the bride) something. I—my mother-in-law
       put a yellow gold coin for me in the hand of my brother Ish6q.’
       (B8:35)An extrapositional construction is used after a presentative clause with
existential particles in (11) and (12). This is likely to be a strategy to mark
off the presentative clause with enhanced distinctness in order to give the
item presented added prominence:  (11) ""í°6n xa-†ùra.} †úra t-ásq6t bíye dìye,} kúlle skinyà°5le.} ‘There is a moun-
       tain. The mountain—you should go up it, it is all (covered in)
       knives.’ (A24:11)
  (12) ""ítl6n ""7n6t ""ùmra.} ""ay-‘ú-ga lá-q7†a-w lá-s6twa bárzi míya dìya.} trè ""5ná°a
       ""ítl6n.} ‘We have the spring of the church. It—its water never dries
       up, in summer or winter.’ (B10:61)Generic or proverbial statements, which have an inherent independence
and distinctness from the preceding context, may open with an initial
topic standing in extraposition, e.g.  (13) ""ó-t šawèrra šáwwa sêkke,} ða-q7°a gu-be-têkke} ‘He who jumps seven
       stakes—(one stake) will hit him in his waist.’ (D2:1)
  (14) xá-naša l-xóðe lítle la-bába la-yèmma la-""àp-xa,} ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.}
       ‘A man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or
       anybody—he, they say concerning him that he has no relatives.’
       (A17:17)In clauses denoting an iterative action containing a constituent with a
universal quantifier, the quantified phrase is often made the topic of the
clause and placed in extraposition, e.g.  (15) kut-mêsta} xa-zága dáry6t bìya.} ‘Put a bell on every hair.’ (A27:8)
  (16) kú-reš6t xúwwe °èle,} q6m-maxèle.} ‘He struck each head of the snake
       that came (his way).’ (A24:40)(iii) Opposition between Topics
In some cases the motivation for the extrapositional construction is to set
up an opposition or parallelism between two topic referents. Each topic
904                            chapter seventeenreferent is placed at the front of the clause and stands in extraposition if
it is not the subject referent, e.g.  (1) ""àxni} kêsl6n} šàb°a} ""íla šawwà-yome} ""u-yàrxa} ""íle †¬a°ì-yome.} ""áxtu šab°7xu
      ""6štà-yomela?} ‘We—a week for us is seven days and a month is thirty
      days. You—is your week six weeks?’ (A17:13)
  (2) ""ítla trè ""otáxe.} ða-""òt6x} ""áni dámxi gàwa.} ""5-xèta} heywànela.} ‘They had
      two rooms. One room—they slept in it. The other one—it was (for)
      the animals.’ (A22:10)
  (3) zeðàye} ""áxl6t mènna t-là-qßaya.} ""u-màsta} ""áxl6t mènna qrúšta díya t-la-xàrwa.}
      ‘The pittas—you should eat them without breaking them. The
      yoghurt—you should eat it without the crust being spoilt.’ (A30:5)
  (4) ""ína júllux hálla †làli.} ""u-xmártux t-átw6n ""àna l-xáßa.} ‘Your clothes—give
      them to me. Your donkey—I shall sit on its back.’ (A6:8)In (5) and (6) the extraposition of the topical subject constituent by means
of an independent pronoun is used to mark it off distinctly from a topic
of an adjacent clause:  (5) d>ráje t-kèp5la,} ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse.} ‘Steps are made of stone, but
      a ladder—it is made of wood.’ (B10:60)
  (6) ""ánna qurðáye barzanàye} ""áni hóla jrà†a.} ""u-suráye lˆla jrá†a.} ‘The Barzan
      Kurds were slipping, but the Christians were not slipping.’ (B19:7)(iv) Prominence of Clause
In some cases the main motivation for an extrapositional construction
with a clause initial topic is to mark it off distinctly from what precedes
in order to give it prominence, e.g.  (1) °éle xa-hambišàya.} hambišàya} ""ˆ-ga} xír5le bìye,} ""áwwa náša lèbbe pqìle!} ‘A
      giant came. The giant looked at him. That man’s heart burst (with
      fear).’ (A31:2)
  (2) lá-b>y6x la-mìya} ""u-la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ""áxni har-xòn6n-it!} ‘We do not want
      water or anything else. You are indeed our brother.’ (A39:12)In (3) the extrapositional clause marks the climactic point of the discourse
section, the origin of the name of the church being the main point of
the narrative:
                                     the clause                                905  (3) gu-d-ò-""umra} †ùmr6lle} ""u-bènyela ""úmra b-réše dìye.} ""áw mútt6lle šèmme díye
      Mar-Sàwa.} ‘They buried him in (the site of) that church and built the
      church over him. They gave it the name of Saint Sawa.’ (B6:30)17.8.2.2. Topic Referents Obligatorily Resumed by L-Suffixes
In certain clauses, an initial topic referent regularly stands in extraposition
and is resumed on the verb by an L-suffix. These include the following:(i) ‘Naming’ Constructions with the Verb ""mr  (1) ""ó-""eða y-amrèxle šèra.} ‘That festival—we call it a šera.’ (B6:22)
  (2) ""áyya y-amrèxla m>màðta.} ‘This—we call it baptism.’ (B6:8)
  (3) ""áni xa†oryà°a y-amríla.} ‘They are called “washing-boards.” ’ (B19:9)(ii) Possessive Constructions with the Existential Particle  (4) ßlí°5la bàxta} xzí°a qa-màlla.} málla ""ítle d6kkán6t ""aparù°a.} ‘The woman
      went down (to the town) and saw the mullah. The mullah had a
      shop of household goods.’ (A22:11)
  (5) ""áw ""ítle ða-""ót6x ""ax-d-àyya.} ‘He has a room like this one.’ (A21:5)
  (6) ""àxni} gu-""Ón-Nùne} ""ítl6n šèra.} ‘We in ""“n-Nune have a saint’s festival.’
      (B5:72)(iii) Clauses Containing Verbs with Impersonal Subjects  (7) "">wáha t-ile xóðe díye b>yéle bàxta.} ‘The man who is alone needs a
      wife.’ (A27:7)17.8.2.3. Narrow focus
In some cases the nuclear stress is placed on an independent pronoun
that resumes an extraposed nominal phrase. This puts narrow focus on
the referent. The construction is typically used when the nominal is a
long phrase, e.g.  (1) kùt la-pál6x} gu-d-áwwa bˆ°a} ""ixála lè y-áx6l.} ""o-t-pàl6x} ""àw t-áx6l.}
      ‘Whoever does not work in this house will not eat food. Whoever
      works—he (and not anybody else) will eat.’ (A21:13)
  (2) qa-mó g8r6g ""áz6l kúlla páxri gu-nùra,} gu-jahànnam?} bas-""7ni t-xzéla ""ày
      xoš-""áza gu-jahànnam.} ‘Why should all my body go to the fire, to
      Hell? Only my eye that saw it—let it go to Hell.’ (A16:2)
906                          chapter seventeen                17.9. Miscellaneous Clausal Particles17.9.1. n6mu/l6mu
This particle gives an expostulatory or hortatory sense to questions. When
used to introduce negative questions, which is its most frequent usage, the
question is equivalent in function to an asseveration, e.g.  (1) nèmu la-mèri-llux dày6‰,} mí°a dày6‰?} ‘Did I not tell you that he would
      return (= indeed I told you . . .), that the dead would return?’
      (A22:39)
  (2) nèmu ""áxni xlúl6t Gwèrg6s la-xálti zwínna kéke dìye} mèra ða-dabàšta?} ‘At
      the wedding of Gw6rg6s did not my aunt buy his cake and say
      “(I buy it) for a beehive? (= indeed my aunt bought his cake . . .)” ’
      (B8:29–30)
  (3) nèmu la-""awðèxle ""áwwa †ùra} d>rajyà°a,} d>ràje,} t-ásq6x l-áwwa †ùra?}
      ‘Should we not make for this mountain steps (= indeed let us
      make . . .), so that we can go up the mountain?’ (A17:4)
  (4) lèmu lá-""asq6n ""àna?} ‘Should I not go? (= indeed I should go)’
      (A39:10)
  (5) lèmu lax-xnìq6llux?} ‘Have we not drowned you? (= surely we have
      drowned you)’ (A7:22)Occasionally the most appropriate translation of the particle is ‘why?’,
e.g.  (6) lat-nxàpa!?} xá ""axwá°i mìra} dráya šlámi ""êllux} ""u-""áti tíwa l-†ìzux!} lèmu
      la-qìmlux?} ‘Are you not ashamed!? A prince like me greets you and
      you sit on your bum. Why did you not get up?’ (A26:48)The particle is occasionally used in positive questions, where it has a
remonstrating force, e.g.  (7) nèmu ""áyya bèrke d-ˆnila} t-it-""áti sxáya gàwa?} ‘Whose is this pool in which
      you are swimming? (= surely it is mine not yours)’ (A25:61)17.9.2. xo-/xu-
This particle, which is related etymologically to Syriac k∫ar, is used most
frequently in negated clauses. When used in non-interrogative clauses, it
intensifies the negation, often with a remonstrating force, e.g.
                                  the clause                                  907  (1)   xo-la-m7°6n làxxa.} ‘I shall not die here.’ (A20:11)

  (8)   xo-lán har-""ána gàw‰a.} ‘I am not the only man (literally: Not only I

remonstrating force, e.g.  (9)  xu-l7wa †axxána bròn-†axxanˆ°a?} ‘Was he really a miller, son of a

                         18.1. Connective Particles18.1.1. w
When functioning as a clausal conjunction, the particle w may be attached
as a clitic either to the initial or final word of a clause. It is realized as ""u- (<
*""uw) when in contact with a consonant at the beginning of a word, e.g.  (1) ""áti tú-tiwa làxxa.} ""u-súsi páy6š làxxa} ""u-""ána bráta masq•nna be-bába dìya.}
      ‘You stay here and my horse will stay here and I shall take the girl up
      to the house of her father.’ (A29:41)
  (2) ""o-yál6t b>yàwale} hóle ""ê°ya-w} q6m-yaw•lla yalêx°a ""•lli.} ‘The young man
      whom she loved has come and has given me her scarf.’ (A4:24)Occasionally, the speaker attaches a particle as a suffix to the end of one
clause and then repeats it as a prefix to the following clause, e.g.  (3) mattíla gu-qußárta mbašlìla-w} ""u-yátwi ""àxli.} ‘They put them in a pan and
      cook them, then sit down to eat them.’ (A1:3)
  (4) mxúll6lla pá°e dìye-w} ""u-zíl5le šúle dìye.} ‘He washed his face and went to
      his work.’ (A21:16)The particle is used to express various types of semantic connection
between clauses. In most cases such semantic connections may also be
expressed by juxtaposing clauses asyndetically without the explicit linguistic
expression of the connection in the form of the connective particle.
   In narrative the particle is used to join clauses that express sequential
events. The majority of sequential clauses in narrative are joined asyn-
detically. The usual strategy is to use the particle before the final clause
of a chain of events. In this respect, therefore, it is a device for marking
sections of discourse that are presented as expressing closely cohering
events, e.g.
910                             chapter eighteen  (5)   ßléle gu-d-o-balù'a.} ""áwwa dúša t-wéwa pyàša} kúlla q6m-daréle gu-d-an-
        gudanyà°a} ""u-grìšla.} ‘He went down into the conduit. He put all
        the honey that was left into the skins and they pulled them up.’
        (A14:19)
  (6)   ""•°ye xakma-dèwe,} mêxy6lle} ""áw ""u-xmáre dìye} ""u-xìl6lle.} ‘Wolves came
        and attacked him and his donkey and ate him.’ (A14:22)The chain of sequential clauses may express habitual actions, future actions
or commanded actions, e.g.  (7)   y-asqíwa malw6šíwale jull-dìye} ""u-y-atwìwa.} ‘They would come up
        (from the river), dress him in his clothes and sit down.’ (B6:26)
  (8)   ""aw-ßále táma mrap•xle xáwla b-réše dìye} ""u-""áyya q>páxta matt•xxa
        r6š-d-o-t8r6t gêppa.} ‘He will go down there, we shall throw the rope
        onto his head and shall put this cover onto the opening of the
        cave.’ (A14:16)
  (9)   qù!} šqúlla ""áyya †àsa} ""u-háyyo mênni.} ‘Get up, take this bowl and
        come with me.’ (A15:11)The chain of clauses that occurs before the connective particle is used
can be of a considerable length. In (10), for example, the particle occurs
for the first time on the verb ""u-zìlle, which comes at the end of a long
sequence of clauses. This passage occurs at the beginning of the story and
the speaker presents the whole sequence has a coherent section, expressing
a single overall situation that sets the scene for what follows.  (10) °éle xa-náša swarìya,} rakáwa.} ßléle r6š-xa-""ˆna.} tìwle,} xílle mêndi,} štéle

       He sat down, ate something and drank some water. He had some
       money. He took it and put it on top of the spring. He forgot his

       a horseman. He went to the spring. He saw the hundred dinars.
       He quickly took them, put them in his pocket and went off. The
       first (rider) said “Oh, I have forgotten my money. I’ll return and
       go to take my money from on top of the spring.” ’ (A15:1–2)
                               clause sequences                                  911A chain of events that is marked off as a unit by the connective particle
may be embedded as a component in a superordinate chain. Consider (11):  (11) ""aw-ßále táma mrap•xle xáwla b-réše dìye} ""u-""áyya q>páxta matt•xxa
       r6š-d-o-t8r6t gêppa.} ""u-mßál6x †la-y•mme díye ""áwwa qur†án6t xmàra.} ‘He
       will go down there, we shall throw the rope onto his head and we
       shall put this cover onto the opening of the cave. Then we shall
       take down to his mother this donkey blanket’.’ (A14:16)Here the first connective marks the end of a series of events that are
planned to take place in a cave. They are presented as a unit, as it were
a single overall activity. This activity at the cave is followed by another
event in which the participants shift to another location. This subsequent
event is joined by a connective particle, which can be regarded as link-
ing the preceding chain as a whole rather than simply the immediately
preceding clause. The particle, therefore, would mark the closure of the
whole composite series of events, which can be represented thus [[A-B-
""u-C] ""u-D].
   In some cases the connective is placed earlier than the final clause of a
sequential chain. This may reflect a strategy of presenting the final clause
as a supplementary tag to what precedes. This applies to the final clauses
in (12) and (13), which contain the verb ‘to go’ and have the function of
taking the participants off the scene. The connective is attached to the pre-
ceding clause, which is presented as the climax of the main chain of events:  (12) °éle xa-náša swarìya,} °éle zílle r6š-""ˆna.} xílle mêndi} ""u-šwíqle zúze díye
       táma zìlle.} ‘A horseman came, he came to a spring. He ate some-
       thing and he left his money there. He went off.’ (A15:15)

       Your son’s donkey went into a valley and your son went to fetch
       it. Wolves came and attacked him and his donkey and ate him.
       We only found this sign of him.” The poor woman began to beat
       (herself) and put ash on her head. Her son had gone! They divided
       the money among them. They went on their way.’ (A14:21–22)
912                            chapter eighteenIn (14) and (15) the final clause, without the connective, is a supplementary
recapitulation of the preceding clause, which is marked as the endpoint
of the sequential chain by the connective:  (14) K8rìm zìlle bar-xmáre díye} †la-m5°éwa xmáre dìye,} ""•°yela déwe gu-ða-lawùrta}
       xíl6lle ""àw-u xmáre díye.} ""u-làx-x6zye ‘ú-m6ndi šuq-m6n-d-ánna.} ""ánna júlle
       dìye x•zye bás.} ‘Karim went after his donkey, to fetch his donkey,
       wolves came into a valley, ate him and his donkey, and we did not find
       anything except these. We found only these clothes of his.’ (A14:17)
  (15) qím5le šqìla-ani} ""u-m·dê‰6lla.} núbl6lla qa-bráte dìye.} ‘He took them and
       returned them. He took them to his daughter.’ (A17:13)Similarly in (16) the clause ‘Let him break his neck’, which does not have
a connective, is appended to the preceding chain of sequential clauses as
an elaborative comment and is not intended to be a component of this
sequence:  (16) si-mxi-""áqlux gu-xáße díye l-àyya k7rta} ""u-hálle ßàle.} šám6† qðále dìye.}
       ‘Go and kick his back on the load (he is carrying) and let him go
       down (the mountain). Let him break his neck.’ (A15:13)The connective particle is used to mark the closure of a chain of turns of
direct speech introduced by the verb ‘to say’. These turns interlace their
way through a story and are often separated by sections of narrative. The
connective in the phrase ""u-m6re in (17) introduces a climactic speech at
the end of the story in which one of the protagonists reveals himself as
an angel. This is preceded by thirty-five occurrences of the direct speech
formula ‘x said’ without the connective. There is clearly a consciousness
on the part of the speaker that the turns in speech cohere together in a
thread. The final speech of the story is not introduced by the connec-
tive (""am6r). This can be regarded as an elaborative tag to what precedes,
functioning as an final epilogue rather than a section in the main chain
of speeches.  (17) m•re hé q6m-y>ðênna.} ""u-mêre si-dú‰ l-šòpux,} ""ax-""arbí-š6nne t-it-""áti

"17.8.1. Structure17.8.1.1. Extraposed Element
The extraposed element may be a nominal or an independent pronoun,
e.g.  (1) ""ó-""eða y-amrèxle šèra.} ‘That festival—we call it a šera.’ (B6:22)
  (2) ""o-Dáwið mòdi šúle díye?} ‘That David—what is his profession?’
      (A16:1)
  (3) ""á m5xólta náš6t k yàlo y-oðíwala.} ‘The food—the family of the bride
      would make it.’ (B5:7)
  (4) ""ána šèmmi ’ùxole} ‘I—my name is ’uxo.’ (A7:18)
  (5) ""áti x7lux ""ˆk5le?} ‘You—where is your strength?’ (A12:38)
  (6) ""áw mútt6lle šèmme díye Mar-Sàwa.} ‘That—they made its name Saint
      Sawa.’ (B6:30)The extraposed nominal is sometimes uttered in a separate intonation
group, e.g.
896                           chapter seventeen  (7) tàwra} primále ðá ""íðe dìye.} ‘The ox—he cut off one of its feet.’
      (A22:3)
  (8) Dáwið kòra} dbíšla bábe-w yèmme bìye.} ‘Blind David—his father and
       mother urged him.’ (A16:5)An extraposed nominal is in principle definite with an identifiable referent.
In some cases the nominal has not been explicity mentioned, but its refer-
ent is referentially anchored in some way to a nominal in the preceding
context, as in (9), where the nominal ‘one room’ is a member of the set
of ‘two rooms’ mentioned earlier. The referent of the nominal may be a
class that is identifiable by its descriptive content alone (10)—(11):  (9) ""ítla trè ""otáxe.} ða-""òt6x} ""áni dámxi gàwa.} ""5-xèta} heywànela.} ‘They had
      two rooms. In one room they slept. The other one was (for) the
      animals.’ (A22:10)
  (10) ""ína semàlta} ""áyya t-qˆse.} ‘But a ladder—it is made of wood.’
        (B10:60)
  (11) kut-m5°éli xábra b6d-bròni,} ""6n-mí°a ""6n-ßàxi,} pálg6t dáwi de-t-yánne ""èlle
        dìye.} ‘Whoever brings me word about my son, whether he is dead
        or alive, I’ll give him half of my gold.’ (A14:92)When the referent of the fronted nominal has the role of direct object
in the clause, marked by a direct object pronominal suffix on the verb, as
in (12)–(15), its syntactic status is ambiguous. This is because there is a
general tendency for there to be a pronominal suffix on the verb agreeing
with a definite direct object constituent irrespective of whether the object
is placed before or after the verb (§15.13.2.1.).  (12) ""a-št7°a šat7wala t-lá mìya.} ‘They drink that drink without water.’
       (B5:14)
  (13) ""áy ""ilána mßaqlìwala.} ‘They decorate that tree.’ (B5:39)
  (14) ""a-štˆ°a} har-tàma mpal†èxwala.} ‘We produced that drink there.’
       (B5:11)
  (15) ""o-qàmxa} m5°7wale bˆ°a.} ‘They would bring the flour back to the
       house.’ (B5:16)Although there is ambiguity on the level of syntactic structure, certain
object initial clauses possess the functional properties of extrapositional
constructions. This applies to the type of construction that has been
                                 the clause                                897referred to in §17.7.5.2. as ‘topic-orientated’ object initial clauses, in which
the object sets the topical frame for the clause. As we shall see, this is a
basic functional property of extraposition. It should also be noted that
the prosodic isolation of the initial object in a separate intonation group,
as in (14) and (15), is a feature common to ‘topic-orientated’ object initial
clauses and extrapositional clauses, but is rarely found in ‘event-orientated’
object initial clauses. ‘Topic-orientated’ object initial constructions with a
resumptive pronoun will be included together with extrapositional con-
structions in what follows.","[934, 935, 936]"
"15.3.9.1.3. Generic Relative Clauses
The qa†6l form of hwy is used in a relative clause that has a generic ante-
cedent rather than one referring to a specific referent, e.g.  (1)   hézuke mòdila?} táli xàwla} b-xa-""ilána t-óya gó‰ta rába ramànta.} ‘What is
        swinging? They hang a rope on a tree that is large and very high.’

        easiest, since there was a lot of snow.’ (B5:195)15.3.9.2. qa†6lwa
The qa†6lwa form of hwy is occasionally used as a realis past form, refer-
ring imperfectively to a situation in the past, e.g.  (1)   ""otáxe gò‰e hawéwa.} ‘The rooms were big.’ (B10:51)
  (2)   kút-xa hawéwale xà.} ‘Everybody used to have one.’ (B10:11)
  (3)   ""áxni lá raba-""i-map6lxêxwala.} ""ína hawèwal6n.} ‘We did not use it (raisin

  (4)   mqarb6níwa l-mà°a} sab-tàlga hawéwa,} lì°waley ""ixála.} ‘They would

  (5)   kul-má°6t ""ítla ""ùmra} ""an-ma°wá°a hawéwaley šèra.} ‘Every village that
        had a church—these villages had a saint’s festival.’ (B6:22)
                            the syntax of verbs                             647In these examples from the text corpus the subject refers to a class rather
than to a specific referent in the class. Examples (1)–(3) refer to a perma-
nent situation, whereas (4)–(5) may be interpreted as having a predicate
with habitual/iterative aspect. The verb ‘to be’ in clauses with the profile
of (1)–(3) may also be expressed by the past copula (§15.3.5.–6.) or past
existential particle (§15.3.8.).
   The qa†6lwa form is also attested as a realis past form in the protasis
of temporal clauses (generally with the subordinating particle D attached
to it), e.g.  (6)   ""7-g6 t-awéwa m8°>lan báw°6 Ninwàye} yapèxwa làz6m háw5 †èlme.} ‘When
        it was, for example, the fast of Nineveh, we had to bake †6lme.’
        (B10:95)Elsewhere the qa†6lwa form is used to express irrealis, which cannot be
expressed by the past copula or existential particle, e.g.  (7)  xéna ""6n-hawéwa bêsra,} . . . dˆr6xwa bèsra.} ‘If there was meat, . . . we
       would serve meat.’ (B10:19)

When the ""i- prefix is added to the qa†6l form of hwy, the initial /h/ is
generally elided, e.g. y-awe < ""i-hawe. Occasionally, however, speakers use
the forms without the elision of the /h/.
   This form is used in place of the copula or existential particle when
the proposition expressed by the clause has a generic property. This is
conditioned by the generic nature of the subject argument or of the
predicate. The ""i-qa†6l form is used when the subject argument is a generic
class term without a specific referent, e.g. tálga xwàra y-áwe} ‘Snow is white.’
In this example it is the subject that contributes to the generic nature of
648                             chapter fifteenthe proposition. The predicate expresses a permanent property. The form
is also used when the subject argument has a specific referent and the
predicate expresses a habitual, iterative situation, e.g. kút-yom brónux làxxa
y-áwe} ‘Everyday your son is here.’ In such cases it is the predicate that
contributes to the generic nature of the proposition rather than the subject.
In many cases where the form is used both of these factors are operative,
in that the subject is a generic class term and the predicate expresses a
habitual, iterative situation, e.g. kut-šéta tálga gu-†ùra y-áwe} ‘Every year there
is snow in the mountains.’
   Examples from the text corpus with generic class terms as subjects and
predicates expressing a permanent property:  (1) lèxma prìša y-áwe.} ‘Bread is different.’ (B5:99)
  (2) lawàše} . . . ""i-max7la l-tanùra.} tanùra} y-áwe xamìma.} ‘They put lawaše in

      ends of the roller are bored, there are holes in them’ (B5:193)As is shown by (4), generic class terms may be pronominalized. The subject
may be distributive denoting ‘each one’ of the class concerned, e.g.  (6) kút-xa y-áwe gu-bˆ°e} ""u-heywáne y-áwa mènne dìye.} ‘Everybody is in his
      home and his animals are with him.’ (B5:116)Examples containing a subject with a specific referent and a predicate
expressing a habitual, iterative situation:  (7) béna Rust8mo ""7-g6t dàm6x} †¬a°à yomá°a} ""u-†¬a°á l5l>wá°a y-áwe dmíxa

      days and three nights and not wake.’ (A29:19)

      (literally: the world) is hot.’ (B6:25)

       dings are on a Saturday (i.e. each time there is a wedding it takes
       place on a Saturday).’ (B5:46)
  (10) ""ap-""èrxe b-gàrre y-áwa.} ‘Also the water-mills are by turns (i.e. each
       time people use a water-mill they take it in turns).’ (B5:90)As we have seen, constructions with the basic copula may also be used
to express the permanent property of a generic subject. In this profile,
therefore, there is free variation between y-awe and the copula. This is seen
in cases such as (11), where both forms are used in the same context:  (11) mandórta ""íle kèpa} gò‰a y-áwe,} yá'ni y-áwe mtúrßa xàß-d-ó-m6ndi.} ‘A
       roller is a stone, which is large and is made specially for this thing.’
       (B5:193)15.3.9.4. ""i-qa†6lwa
The ""i-qa†6lwa form of hwy is used as a realis past form, referring imperfec-
tively to a situation in the past. It is attested in the text corpus in clauses
with a variety of profiles.(i) Clauses with a subject argument referring to a specific referent and
with a predicate expressing a permanent property, e.g.","[685, 686, 687, 688]"
"18.1.6.1. Temporal Sequence
It sometimes signals the temporal sequentiality of an event in relation to
what precedes, e.g.

                           18.2. Negated ClausesHere we shall examine two features of clause sequences containing
negated clauses.
934                            chapter eighteen18.2.1. Negated Interrogative Clauses Expressing Preliminary Background Material
A negated clause that is pronounced with intonation patterns related to
those of questions (§18.5.3.) is sometimes used to signal that the situation
described in the clause should be taken as the grounds for what follows.
The construction is a device to draw attention to the clause, in order to
set it up as a boundary in the discourse, acting as the onset of a new
section. It is most commonly used to express temporal background. This
may express a situation that overlaps temporally with the following main
event (1–2) or a preceding event that marks its onset (3–6):  (1) ""ánna l7la dmìxe,} ""o-rább6n mútt6lla ""áqle díye rš-8q6l bàxta.} ‘While they
      were asleep, the monk put his leg onto the leg of the woman.’ (A16:11)
  (2) lá y-ßal•xwa ˙átta ""ùmra} x†ì°5wa ßál6xwa sarkóle.} ‘When we went down
      to church, it was a sin to go bare-headed.’ (B10:44)
  (3) lá m>y•xwa gùða,} pal†•xwala óìta.} ‘When we shook the churn, we
      would take out the curds.’ (B10:9)
  (4) la-°éle rèš-ßàwma,} b-šaql•xwa kúlla ""amàn6n,} kùlla b-šaql•xwala} d7r6xwa
      q•†ma mxallêxwala.} ‘When the beginning of the (Lent) fast came, we
      would take all our vessels, we would take them all and put ash on
      them to clean them.’ (B16:7)
  (5) l7le mútt6lla ""áqle dìye}—ßáwl6t màlka} ""iw7wa dàwa}—mútt6lla rš-d-àn b6z-
      máre,} ""o-b6zmára xíla m6n-dàwa,} šqíla m6n-dàwa.} ‘When he placed his
      foot—the shoes of the king were made of gold—he placed them on
      the nails, the nail ate the gold, took some of the gold.’ (A14:28)
  (6) ""áyya másta la-q6m-daríla gu-d-aw-gùða,} . . . heš-t-là bráza,} xán‘i t-la-bráza
      m5°íwa xa-g•lla y-amríle sêrmo.} ‘When they have put the yoghurt in the
      churn . . . while it is not yet dry, shortly before it becomes dry, they
      would fetch a herb called s6rmo.’ (B14:1)Occasionally the construction is used to express the causal grounds for
the situation described in what follows, e.g.  (7) dúk°6 d-ó-g6ld6t tàwra,} l5le-wíða g•dda zòra,} xzi-k6má m>sà˙a dwíqle.}
      ‘Since he had made it into a fine thread, the place (enclosed by) the
      ox skin covered a great area.’ (A11:13)On sporadic occasions the negative construction expresses the background
of a preceding rather than following clause, e.g.
                               clause sequences                                  935  (8) maxíwale b-réš6t nàše,} kúlla ""áni là mbarxíwal5 qáša-w šamàša.} ‘They
      tapped it on the head of people, while the priest and the deacon
      blessed them all.’ (B16:24)18.2.2. Gapping of the Negator
When a negated clause is followed by one or more clauses that are negated
in sense and elaborate on the first clause, the negative particle la may be
gapped. This applies to all verbal forms, including imperatives (3):  (1) ""6n-háw5 ""6ßrà †iyáre xéne} ""axwá°ux hawnàne,} la-ma†étuwa l-àwwa l•xma,}
      ""u-""attítuwa láxxa p5šítuwa hátxa snìqe.} ‘If ten other men from ˇiyare
      were as intelligent as you, you would not have reached this (miser-
      able condition of begging for) bread and would not be sitting here,
      in such a needy state.’ (B17:16)
  (2) tùna d5r•xwale gáwe} qa-lá-ßaliwa míya ""êlt6x,} qa-t-ßáliwa míya hátxa b-rèš6n.}
      ‘We would put straw in it, so that water would not flow down, so
      that water would not flow down on our head.’
  (3) lá-wuð hàtxa} q†úl ""anna-bnón6 náše kùlla.} ‘Don’t do that, don’t kill all the
      people.’ (A29:17)In (4) the construction with the gapped negator is separated from the first
by an intervening imperative. The gapping explains why the ""i-qa†6l form
y-asq6n is used with future reference (< la-y-asq6n ‘I shall not go up’):  (4) l•mu lá-""asq6n ""àna?} hálli ˙àwla.} y-ásq6n kúlla q7se mj>mênna} ""u-""úrxa
      pa°xênna} qa-t-míya ßála qam-tar-gêppa?} ‘Why should I not go (alone)?
      Give me a rope. (Why should I not) gather all the wood and open up
      the way so that the water will come down to the door of the cave.’
      (A39:10)
                   18.3. Intonation Group BoundariesWhen presenting a series of connected main clauses, the speaker may
utter each clause in a separate intonation group, e.g.  (1) j•nne ""ê°yela,} šqìl6lla Zíne} nùbl6lla Jazíra Bóta.} ‘The jinn came and took
      Zine, took her away to Jazira Bota.’ (A26:8)
936                            chapter eighteen  (2) ""áwwa qím5le qedàmta,} šqíl6lle xa-m6n-sús6t xàle,} tíwa l-xáße dìye,} ""u-ßêlya.}
      ‘He got up in the morning, took one of his father’s horses, sat on
      its back and went down.’ (A25:40)
  (3) ""u-zìl5le,} mútt6lle réše dìye} dmìx5le.} ‘He went, put down his head and
      slept.’ (A25:43)
  (4) p7š6n xa-nêšra} t-yátw6n l-xàß6x} m†amrênn6x gu-""úpra.} ‘I shall become an
      eagle and sit on your back and bury you in the ground.’ (A25:63)In some cases more than one main clause is placed in the same intonation
group. This is found particularly with short verbal clauses, often consisting
of no more than the verbal form without any nominal complements. If
there are nominal complements, these tend to occur in the final clause.
   In general, the effect of placing two or more clauses together in the
same intonation group is to present the activities expressed by the clauses
as being closely related in that they can be interpreted as forming compo-
nents of a single overall event. The clauses of the series, moreover, usually
have the same subject. There is no formal syntactic subordination in the
form of subordinating particles and the verbs in the series are, in principle,
in the same form (e.g. q†ille, q†il5le etc.). There are, however, some formal
signals of dependence, which reflect their close cohesion. The initial verb,
for example, is combined directly with the following verbal clause in an
asyndetic paratactic construction rather than being linked with the con-
nective particle w, e.g.  (5) zílle qítle b-xa-†ùra.} ‘It went and hit a mountain.’ (A50:10)
  (6) táwra mítle npìlle táma.} ‘The ox died and collapsed there.’ (A22:9)In a series of compound verbal forms in narrative sequences a conspicu-
ous reflection of dependence is the omission of the copula element after
the first verb (§15.4.1.3., §15.4.2.3.), e.g.  (7) ""•°y5le tíwa b-dìw6n.} ‘He came and sat down in the reception room.’
      (A26:63)There is a particular tendency for the occurrence of prosodic bonding of
clauses in a single intonation group after certain verbs (§18.3.1.– §18.3.8.)
and in certain syntactic contexts (§18.3.9.– §18.3.11.).
                             clause sequences                             93718.3.1. qym
The basic meaning of this verb is ‘to get up’. When the verb occurs in a
separate intonation group, it frequently has this basic meaning, e.g.  (1) ""ay-qìmt5la,} wíðta qàwa.} ‘She got up and made coffee.’ (A26:31)
  (2) Mir-Zándin qìm5le} b8ye qa†êlle.} ‘Mir-Zandin got up and wanted to kill
      him.’ (A26:67)Also when combined with another verb in the same intonation group,
the interpretation of the verb as having its basic meaning is appropriate
in some contexts, e.g.  (3) xa-màlka} kút-yum ðà-brata gaw•rwa.} mbádla qay•mwa qa†êlwala.} ‘A king
      would marry a girl everyday. In the morning he would get up and kill
      her.’ (A14:1)In many cases, however, the verb is used with a less specific meaning and
functions as a general marker of the onset of an activity or situation. In
several cases the interpretation is ambiguous, since the onset of a series of
actions in narrative often could be interpreted as coinciding with the act of
‘getting up’. It is, indeed, this ambiguity that has led to the generalization
of its meaning. In some contexts, nevertheless, the verb clearly does not
admit being interpreted as denoting the physical act of ‘getting up’. It is
used, for example, before verbs denoting ‘sitting down’, e.g.  (4) qímela tìwela,} wíðela tàgbir.} ‘They sat down and made a plan.’ (A26:2)It is attested before verbs denoting states, non-dynamic activities or pas-
sive constructions in which the grammatical subject has no dynamic role
in the action, e.g.  (5) qím5le píš5le màjbur} M8mo dì‰5le.} ‘M>mo was forced to return.’ (A26:38)
  (6) ""u-qím5le mpúl†5le mu'àll6m.} ‘The teacher was then brought out.’
      (A22:41)When the verb qym acts as an onset marker, it is used to signal some kind
of boundary in the discourse, dividing the discourse into sections that
cohere together. In (7), for example, the construction occurs at the onset
of a section concerning the jinn. In (8) the act of replying to the letter
938                             chapter eighteenis presented as separate from that of capturing the dove and reading the
letter. In (9) the arrival at the mountain is presented as a shift in scene
and an episodic boundary. In (10) it occurs at the beginning of a narrative
section after direct speech. Note that here it coincides with the use of the
particle –≥i, which is also a boundary marker (§18.1.4.1.):  (7)  jênne} t-šmàyya} qímla wídla tàgbir.} ‘The jinn of heaven made a plan.’
       (A26:1)
  (8) S6ttíye zìlt5la} dwíqt6lla yáwna hàtxa,} šqìlt6lle.} k°áwa qrì°6lle.} ""u-qímt5la
       mjuwàbt6lle} ""u-yíwt6lle qa-yàwna.} ‘S6ttiye went and grabbed the dove
       like this and took it. She read the letter. She answered it and gave
       it to the dove.’ (A25:72)
  (9) qíma dart-yòma,} mj≥m6lla maymùne} ""u-xðìr5le.} qímela mê†yela} xa-†ùra.}
       ‘The next day he gathered the monkeys together and toured
       around. They arrived at a mountain.’ (A14:48)
  (10) m•re ""áti t-áz6t t-yátw6t t>màha.} ßáli šalxíla julléy t-yáwne tàmma.} ""áti
       xáz6t ""ày-m6nna b8y6t} šaql•tla ""ánna jùlle,} m5°êtla-lli} lítlux šùla.} ""áwwa-≥i
       qím5le ßêly5le.} ‘He said “You go and sit over there. They will go
       down and take off their doves’ clothes. See which one you like and
       take the clothes (belonging to her) and bring them to me, and all
       will be fine.” He went down.’ (A14:80–81)Prosodic bonding of the verb qym occurs in imperative and other deontic
constructions, e.g.  (11) qu-plú† m-àxxa!} ‘Get out of here!’ (A16:11)
  (12) qu-p7g6n kàde!} ‘Get up and bake kade cakes!’ (A30:41)
  (13) qu-šqúlla ""áyya skìnta!} ‘Take this knife!’ (A15:8)
  (14) qu-qálb6x b7°a biš-spày.} ‘Let’s return home—that’s better.’ (A30:55)In (15) the resultative participle qime is combined with imperative forms:  (15) qíme so-mˆ°ole ""6lli-díyi!} ‘Go and bring him to me!’ (A7:7)18.3.2. Verbs of Movement
These include verbs such as ""zl ‘to go’, ""°y ‘to come’, dy‰ ‘to return’, ßly ‘to
go down’, ""sq ‘to go up’, which are commonly bonded prosodically with
a following verb, e.g.
                                clause sequences                            939  (1)   S6ttíye zílla q6m-dawqàla. ‘S6ttiye went and grabbed it.’ (A25:72)
  (2)   zíl5le m•xya t9ra.} ‘He went and knocked at the door.’ (A14:28)
  (3)   ""u-°éle náša q6m-šaqêlle m•nnux.} ‘A man came and took it from you.’
        (A17:35)
  (4)   ""êdl5le} xa-bráta °í°5wa dmíxta kêsli.} ‘This night a girl came and slept
        with me.’ (A26:11)
  (5)   dí‰‰e ""o-qamáya q6m-qa†•lle ""o-sàwa.} ‘The first man returned and killed
        the old man.’
  (6)   ""u-dí‰5le ß•ly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na.} ‘He went back down to the spring.’
        (A26:32)
  (7)   ""áxni †la-mò ßál6x ""áxni mpal†•xle?} ‘Why should we go down and
        release him?’ (A26:77)
  (8)   síqle wírre k6s-bràta.} ‘He went up and entered the girl’s home.’
        (A17:24)Examples with imperatives:  (9) sa-dùqla ""ayya-yáwna!} ‘Go and grab that dove!’ (A25:72)
  (10) d6-háyyo sxà!} ‘Come and swim!’ (A25:61)
  (11) ßli-mur-""êlle} ‘Go down and say to him . . .’ (A26:37)When the verbs ßly ‘to go down’ or ""sq ‘to go up’ occur in a tight sequence
to a preceding verb, the sequences can often be rendered idiomatically
by English phrasal verbs containing the elements ‘down’ and ‘up’ respec-
tively, e.g.  (12) zadéle ßàle} gu-xa-‘ále gò‰ta.} ‘He threw him down into a big pit.’
       (A22:40)
  (13) kút-yum xá-""6rw6n y-ar•qwa y-ás6q qám d-o-dèwa.} ‘Every day one of
       our sheep would run up to that wolf.’ (A10:5)18.3.3. mßy/ ""mß ‘to be able’
When used in a past perfective form (mßele, m6ßy5le), this verb is often com-
bined asyndetically in a paratactic relation with the verb that is dependent
on it, in that the second verb is put in a past perfective form (q†ille, q6m-
qa†6l, q†il5le), e.g. mßele °ele ‘He was able to come’. The same applies to
negated clauses, e.g. la mßele °ele ‘He could not come’, la mßele q6m-""aw6dla
‘He could not do it’. The second verb in a negative construction is seman-
tically irrealis, since the action did not take place. In principle, therefore,
940                          chapter eighteenan irrealis form would be expected. The use of the realis perfective form
has apparently arisen by morphological attraction. This, no doubt, is the
background also of the positive construction. The majority of examples
from the text corpus are negated or occur in interrogative clauses:  (1) là-mßeli mu°yáli.} ‘I could not bring her.’ (A8:55)
  (2) ""áyya bàxta} lá-mßela mxumˆla ""•rwe.} ‘The woman could not keep the
      sheep.’ (A10:6)
  (3) la-mßél6n s•ql6n ßˆda.} ‘We could not go up to hunt.’ (A26:46)
  (4) lá-mßeli zrìli.} ‘I could not cultivate.’ (A30:13)
  (5) l7la-m6ßye wíðe ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘They could not do anything.’ (A8:65)
  (6) dáx mßéle ""áyya bráta q6m-""aw•dla b-p6lxán6t bˆ°a?} ‘How could he have
      made this girl a hard-working housewife?’ (A21:32)

      two children in the stream?’ (A8:15)When the verb mßy/ ""mß is in the qa†6l form, expressing the present or
future, the complement verb is in the irrealis form, sometimes introduced
by the subordinating particle D, e.g.  (8) máß6x t-àmr6x} ‘We can say’ (B4:3)In (9) a perfective past verb is followed by another perfective verb but the
latter is introduced by the subordinating particle D:  (9) bráta làn-m6ßya t-in-mú°y6lla.} ‘I could not bring back the girl.’ (A29:8)18.3.4. ßbr ‘to dare’
A similar paratactic joining is found after perfective forms of ßbr ‘to dare’,
e.g. ßbirre °ele ‘He dared to come’, la ßbirre °ele ‘He did not dare to come’.
The examples attested in the text corpus are negated:  (1) ""áp-xa m•nna lá-ßbirre rhíwle gu-dìw6n.} ‘Nobody dared to speak in the
      reception room.’ (A26:70)
  (2) lá ßbírra mßuwêtla.} ‘She did not dare to speak.’ (A24:40)

The verb qbl ‘to permit’ may be used in a similar syntactic structure. In
the following example from the text corpus it is negated:  (1) ""áw là-qbille °éli.} ‘He did not permit me to come.’ (A46:3)18.3.6. šry II ‘to begin’
This verb is normally followed by an infinitive (§15.5.5.). When, however,
it is in a perfective past form, it is sometimes followed by a perfective form
of the verb linked to it paratactically in the same intonation group, e.g.  (1) šuréle zmírre b-súsa smòqa.} ‘He started singing to a brown horse.’
      (A25:11)
  (2) šuréla xrì†la.} ‘She started to gouge it out.’ (A19:6)
  (3) šúryela xílela m-©ðàðe.} ‘They began to eat together.’ (A21:21)18.3.7. prq ‘to finish’
Similarly, the verb prq ‘to finish’ is sometimes combined together with a
verb in the same intonation group, e.g.  (1) bar-príqla kúlla náše šqílla ""arz?q.} ‘After all the people had finished tak-
      ing provisions . . .’ (B17:12)18.3.8. pyš majbur ‘to become obliged’
This expression is used to express an obligation and is often prosodically
bonded with the following verb, which expresses the lexical content of
the action, e.g.  (1) páy6š májbur béna xaráya šàte.} ‘In the end it will be forced to drink.’
      (A12:47)
  (2) píš5le májbur ßêly5le.} ‘He had to dismount.’ (A28:33)
942                             chapter eighteen18.3.9. Cirumstantial Clauses
When a clause is dependent on another clause by virtue of the fact that
it expresses the circumstances of the action of the other clause, this
dependence is often expressed prosodically by combining the two clauses
in the same intonation group, e.g.  (1) kúlla ""•°ye ""itléy š>rá†e t-amríla qa-màlka.} ‘They had all come while hav-
      ing cases to present to the king.’ (A17:31)
  (2) hadíya b8ye t-áx6l m•ndi kpìn5le.} ‘Now he wanted to eat something,
      since he was hungry.’ (A30:11)
  (3) ""u-sulámm6š doqíle lóši xa-jùlla.} ‘They would hold the hive whilst wear-
      ing a cloth.’ (B5:178)18.3.10. Temporal Adverbial Clauses
Similarly, prosodic bonding between main clauses is often used when one
clauses supplies the temporal adverbial setting of the action of the fol-
lowing clause. In such cases the first clauses is idiomatically translated by
supplying a temporal particle such as ‘after’ or ‘when’, e.g.  (1) barzíwa xá‘‘a mkal‘ìwala.} ‘(After) they (the logs) had dried a little, they
      would remove their bark.’ (B5:187)
  (2) hadíya mkop•šla ßlèla.} ‘Now (after) they had gathered it, they went
      down (to the plain).’ (A7:15)
  (3) b>láwala yabíšta x6rqá x6rqá gu-qðála díya mabyênwa.} ‘(When) she swal-
      lowed a raisin, it could be seen, ring by ring in her neck.’ (A8:63)
  (4) m†éle mo°7°6lle xá‘‘a mìya.} ‘(When) he came, she brought some water.’
      (A22:28)
  (5) hátta Gozáli b-gáne mšudr•tle lˆn °í°a.} ‘Even (when) you sent Gozali
      himself, I did not come.’ (A8:94)18.3.11. Complement of a Clause Constituent
Another context in which clauses occur in a single intonation group due
to their semantic connection is where the second clause functions as a
complement of a constituent in the first clause. In (1), for example, the
second clause should be analysed as the complement of the noun ""urxa
‘way’ (‘the way she learnt’):
                               clause sequences                                943  (1) dáx ""úrxa muxzélux ""•lla lípla ""àwwa šúla?} ‘How did you show her the
      way to learn this work?’ (A21:34)This applies also to clauses that are formally marked as subordinate by
by the particle D. When these are direct complements of a verb, they are
typically in the same intonation group as the verb, e.g.  (2) ""ánna y8ði t-íle duglàna.} ‘They know that he is a liar.’ (A48:3)
  (3) b8y6n t-àz6n.} ‘I want to go.’ (A8:65)
  (4) máß6x t-àmr6x.} ‘We can say.’ (B4:3)If, however, the subordinate clause is not integrated into the main clause
as the complement of a constituent, but rather is a complement of the
clause as a whole and so is external to it, this looser relationship is some-
times expressed by putting the subordinate clause in a separate intonation
group, e.g.  (5) ""ána paqðênn5xu} t-azítu b-""úrxa ma†ítu ""êlla.} ‘I shall instruct you, so that
      you go on the road and reach her.’ (A8:27)
    18.4. Repetition of Clauses to Mark a Discourse BoundarySome types of repetition across clauses have been described already in
relation to the connective particles (cf. §18.1.1., §18.1.2.). A further type
of repetitive overlap across clauses is described in this section.
   In narrative the narrator sometimes repeats the mention of an event that
has already been narrated before recounting the event that is sequential
to it. The informational status of the clause, therefore, may be compared
to that of a topical referent. The purpose of ‘heavy’ coding of topical
information at the front of a sentence is generally to mark some kind of
boundary in the narrative. This is, indeed, the function of the construc-
tion under discussion since it is used to signal the onset of a section. It is
a device used by the narrator to present an activity as a new event with
a degree of independence from what precedes. This is usually a result
of the subjective choice of the speaker as to how the narrative should be
staged. The function of this construction is similar to that of subordinate
‘when’–clauses (§19.3.3.) and, indeed, they are often idiomatically rendered
by supplying ‘when’ in an English translation. Examples:
944                              chapter eighteen  (1) kúlla twìre qðaléy,} mì°ela.} mì°ela,} ""áwwa rìq5le,} ß•ly5le m†ùšy6lla gáne.}
      ‘They all broke their necks and died. (When) they died, he fled, went
      down and hid himself.’ (B18:6)
  (2) xà-yoma} sìqle} l-ßˆda,} tfìqle} xa-""àrya bíye díye.} tfíqle xa-""àrya bíye díye,}
      zílle †ál6b ""àrya.} ‘One day he went out hunting and a lion chanced
      to come his way. (When) a lion chanced to come his way, he went
      to attack the lion.’ (A27:3)
  (3) qímle q6m-†arêdle.} q6m-†ar•dle °éle zìlle} be-""ámte dìye.} ‘He drove him
      away. (When) he drove him away, he went back to his aunt’s house.’
      (A23:32–33)
  (4) zílla q6m-qa†làla} Šóš6t Xère,} q6m-m†amrála gu-""òr6t sus>wá°a ""•lt6x.} q6m-
      m†amrála gu-""ór6t sus>wà°a,} bróna díya °èle.} ‘She went and killed Šoš6t
      Xere and buried her in the horses’ manger below. (When) she buried
      her in the horses’ manger, her son came back.’ (A38:3–4)The repeated material is in some cases uttered with a different distribution
of stress either across the words of a stress group (5) or within a single
word (6):  (5) map6rxálux šawwà yamá°a,} má†6t l-d-o-qàßra.} má†6t l-d-ò-qaßra,} háw6t
      h•šy6r ""ína ""áyya sústa là marp•tla.} ‘She will fly you over the seven seas
      and you will reach that palace. (When) you arrive at that palace, be
      careful not to let that horse go.’ (A12:29)
  (6) ""u-m•†y5le qam-d-o-†ùra.} m6†y7le qam-d-o-†ùra,} xirˆle,} mùjb5le.} ‘He
      arrived in front of the mountain. He arrived in front of the moun-
      tain, he looked and was amazed.’ (A8:53)In cases where long morphological variants are available, the long form
is used either in the first clause or in the repeated clause. This can be
regarded as two alternative strategies whereby a heavy morphological
form is used as a boundary marker to signal either closure or onset. In
(7) the first clause has a long form of pronominal suffix on the resultative
participle to mark closure (§15.13.5.), whereas the repeated clause has the
shorter, default form. In (8), on the other hand, the long variant of the
imperative is used in the repeated clause:  (7) ""i°á°a qàmx5le,} p°ìxt6llela t8ra.} p°íxt6lle t9ra,} xzí°6lle bába dìya} ""u-""up-w8zīr
      mênne.} ‘While there was flour on her hands, she opened the door.
      She opened the door and saw her father and also the vizier who was
      with him.’ (A21:26)
                                clause sequences                                    945  (8)   só l-b7°6t flàn-naša.} sógun l-b7°6t flàn-naša,} ""u-š•qlula ""an-trè-yale,} ""u-
        mtàlquley.} ‘Go to the house of such-and-such a man. Go to the
        house of such-and-such a man, and take away the two children.
        Get rid of them.’ (A8:8)In (9)–(11) the repeated clause has more lexical material than the first
clause. This again can be viewed as a strategy of using linguistic ballast
to mark a boundary, which should be interpreted as the onset of what
follows. In (9) the repeated clause also exhibits the use of the long alter-
native form of the 3pl. suffix -l5y (cf. §15.12.):  (9)  ""í°wa xá-n>ra tàma.} kut-táwra m•xy6lle xá gu-réše dìye,} gu-be-""7ne

       them they should do. They went off. The police went off at night
       and took the two children from their father and mother.’ (A8:9)
                          18.5. Intonation PatternsThe relationship between clauses is also signalled by the pitch contours
associated with the nuclear stress in an intonation group. By means of
intonation contours the speaker conveys to the hearer a wide range of
signals, some of which belong to levels of expression that have no direct
correlations in linguistic structure, such as numerous personal attitudes.
For this reason it was decided not to mark the intonational pitch contours
in the transcription of the texts. Here we shall restrict ourselves to a
brief examination of some of the main intonational signals, with special
attention to those that mark semantic continuity and discontinuity across
946                         chapter eighteenclauses. The semantic connection between clauses is an issue that has
been discussed in numerous places in the foregoing discussion of syntactic
structure.
   We may distinguish two basic types of intonational contours that
are relevant for the present discussion, namely a contour expressing
disjunction and one expressing conjunction. Following the terminology that
is customary in the field of intonation, we may refer to these as ‘major
juncture’ and ‘minor juncture’ respectively.","[971, 972, 973, 974, 975, 976, 977, 978, 979, 980, 981, 982, 983, 984, 985]"

    For the distinction between ‘narrow focus’ and ‘broad focus’ see Lambrecht (1994:
222).
690                              chapter fifteenAs in (1), the importance of the event is expressed also by repetition.
Similarly (3) puts prominence on the item j>naza ‘funeral, death’, which
denotes an unexpected and portentous situation:  (1) kúlla píše pà‰ela,} ""êrwe.} kúlla píše ""êrwela.} ‘They all became lambs,
      sheep. They all became sheep.’ (A34:19)
  (2) ""u-qím5le lwíša júll6 brón6t màlk5le.} lwíš5le jùlle.} ""u-sìq5le.} ‘Then he put
      on the clothes of the son of a king. He put on his clothes and went
      up.’ (A24:35)
  (3) hadíya gáw‰6x píša j>nàz5le.} mèra yá mút j>nàza?!} ‘ “Your husband is
      now dead.” She said “Why is he dead?” ’ (A10:13)A subject argument that is not within the broad focus of the predicate is
in some circumstances postposed at the end of the clause after the nuclear
stress in the intonation group. This is the case in (4), which highlights the
surprising achievement of financial success, but does not draw particular
attention to the fact that it was the old woman rather than somebody else
who was the agent of this action:  (4) wíðta šùl5la tóto.} ‘The old woman made (good) business.’ (A4:22)In some cases the construction appears to be primarily intended to
give prominence to the clause as a whole in order to act as a discourse
boundary marker rather than to only the item bearing the clitic. Such
clauses with enhanced prominence are often used to mark the boundary
of a section of discourse. The boundary may be at the beginning or the
closure of a section. In (5), for example, the construction opens a section
of the narrative that is set in the cave of Leli°a. In (6) the construction
occurs at the end of a series of clauses that is presented as a closely-knit
sequence of events. This is followed by a section of direct speech, which
is introduced by repeating the clause that closed the preceding section.
In (7) the construction likewise marks the end of a chain of clauses that
culminates in the arrival of the protagonist at a new spatial location:  (5) q6m-maqêdla} ""awèdla t>rêkka,} q†ilàle.} wíra gu-gèpp6t Lelì°5le.} ˙átta ‘ám‘e
      t-dàwa!} ‘6ngále t-dàwa!} kúb6 ‘áy t-dàwa!} ‘He burnt her (Leli°a), made
      her a corpse, killed her. He went into the cave of Leli°a. There were
      even spoons of gold, forks of gold, tea cups of gold!’ (A32:23–24)
  (6) qìmt5la} šèry6lla ""áqle w-ìðe} ""u-ßèlya l-bˆ°5le.} ßèlya bˆ°5le,} d6-súq sùq} . . .
      ‘She got up. He released her feet and hands and he went down to
                             the syntax of verbs                                691      his home. He went down to his home (and he said) “Go up . . .” ’
      (A10:13)
  (7) bron6t-málka šrí†5le l-a-gòt-hòd6x} nèra.} zíla níxa níxa wíra gu-d-a-mà°5le.}
      ‘The son of the king escaped to the other side of the river. He went
      along slowly and entered the village.’ (A14:58)Two events that are set up in opposition to each other may be given
enhanced distinctness by rightward movement of the copula onto the
nuclear stress bearing item. In (8) a mother lion stands back while her cubs
go down to a pool to drink water. These are presented as two opposing
events that occurred simultaneously. The prominence expressed by the
copula on the noun mìy5la (< miya-ila) is not intended to put particular
informational prominence specifically on this item of the clause but rather
is intended to give an enhanced prominence and so distinctness to the
clause as a whole. This distinctness expressed in the syntax is motivated
by the desire of the speaker to present the two events in a clear opposi-
tion. The same applies to (9), in which the attack on the horse is set up
in opposition to the attack on the ox:  (8) klì°5la-""ay.} bnóna díya ßèlye šètye mìy5la.} ‘She stood. Her young went
      down and drank water.’ (A33:10)
  (9) xazéle xa-tàwra,} ""Ùmmo} xazéle tàwra} ""u-parêmle réš6 táwra.} . . . zíla mè†ya
      l-sùsele,} ""ap-súsa prìm6lle.} ‘He saw an ox. Ummo saw an ox and cut
      off the head of the ox. . . . He went and came to the horse. He
      slaughtered also the horse.’ (A23:30)15.4.1.5. Resultative Participle Combined with the Past Copula
The resultative participle may be combined with the past copula (for the
morphology of this compound form see §8.8.3. and §8.19.4.2.). This con-
struction, which may be designated as the past resultative, denotes a state
that existed in the past as the result of a prior event. It is typically used
to express the background against which a past event took place, e.g.  (1) xa-""à©a,} ""Ùsman šèmme díye,} °èle,} ""árxa píšle k6s-Xoš9ba margáya.} ""áwwa
      šèmy5wa bud-dìye} ""í°wale ""èrwe ràbe.} ‘An agha, whose name was
      Usman, came and became the guest of Khoshaba from Marga.
      He had heard concerning him that he had many small cattle.’
      (C7:1)
  (2) baxt-xáli šít5w6lle bˆ°a.} ""u-°éla qá†u wírra tàma.} ""u-d6ryáli š6ndùxta,}
      qítla gu-nepùxta.} ‘The wife of my uncle had plastered a room. A
692                             chapter fifteen      cat came and entered. I threw a stone, but it hit some date syrup.’
      (A23:36)
  (3) mère ha-bròni,} M9mo,} mà-lux} tíw6t xaššàna?} mère bábi hàl ""u-qèßß6t hàtx5la.}
      mère ""êdl5le} xa-bráta °í°5wa dmíxta kêsli.} ""u-qímli qedàmta,} la-x6zyàli.}
      ‘He said “Ah, my son, M>mo, why are you sitting (looking so) sad?”
      He said “Father, the situation is like this”. He said “Last night a
      girl came and slept with me. I got up in the morning and did not
      find her.” ’ (A26:10–11)
  (4) xá-yoma plí†ewa ßˆda.} zíle xa-dùk°a,} málka dmìx5le.} ‘One day they
      had gone out hunting. They went to a place and the king fell asleep.’
      (A11:4)Like the present resultative construction, the past resultative does not
denote a specific event, but rather the existence of a state resulting from
some event that took place at some unspecified time in the past. This
may have been one single event taking place at one particular time or a
series of iterative events. If it is one specific event, in principle it could
have been presented as an event in a narrative sequence in a narrative
verbal form such as q†ille or q6m-qa†6l. The speaker, however, chooses to
disjoin the events and background the first event by presenting its resul-
tant state rather than the event itself, and thereby give more prominence
to the temporally sequential foregrounded event that is expressed by the
narrative verbal form. In (2) the speaker is explaining why his uncle had
thrown him out of the house. This was because of an incident in which
a cat entered a newly plastered room. The plastering of the room was
not in itself the crucial event that brought about his expulsion. In (3) the
reason M>mo is sad is not because a girl came to him in the night, but
rather because he could not find her in the morning. As can be seen, in
most cases it is appropriate to translate the past resultative with the English
pluperfect, which expresses backgrounding. In some cases, however, this
is not the case, as in (3), where it is not idiomatic due to the presence of
a temporal adverbial.
   When the verb has telic actionality, the resultative participle in the
construction normally has an adjectival sense, e.g.  (5) ""ì°wa} xa-ràbb6n.} tíw5wa gu-xa-g6ppì°a.} °éle xa-náša swarìyya,} rakáwa.}
      ‘There was once a monk. He was dwelling in a small cave. A horse-
      man, a rider came.’ (A15:1)
                             the syntax of verbs                                693The disjunction between the past resultative form and the foreground
verb may be adversative in nature, especially when the past resultative
form is negated, e.g.  (6)   xu-lanwa-mír6llux maxzètli x>zìna.} muxzélux ""áwwa x>zìna-6lli.} ‘Indeed
        I had not asked you to show me a treasure, but you showed this
        treasure to me.’ (A14:23)Since the construction expresses a background state rather than an event
in a sequence, it may be placed after the clause expressing the event that
is temporally posterior to it, e.g.  (7)   ""up-""áyya šéta xzéli ßòpa.} ""ánna xamšassèr-š6nne ßópa lánwa xêzya.} ‘Also
        this year I saw a stove. I had not seen a stove for fifteen years.’
        (B15:23)In the foregoing examples, the past tense verbal forms in the foreground
clause(s) are either q†ille or q6m-qa†6l. These may express a recent event with
an endpoint that coincides with the present moment, which are translated
idiomatically with an English perfect of recent past, e.g.  (8)   gáw‰i °èle.} zíl5wa be-šwàwe.} xzi-°èle.} ‘My husband has come back.
        He had gone to our neighbours’ house. Look he has come back.’
        (A22:32)In narratives the foreground event may be expressed by the compound
q†il5le form, which in such contexts is used with the same function as q†ille
and q6m-qa†6l to denote an event rather than a resultant state (§15.4.1.3.),
e.g.  (9)  ""áwwa síqa-wewa l-†ùra} l-ßˆda.} ""è°y5le T>tár-i Slemán-i Sêndi} m6n-""Ìr6n.}
       ""è°y5le gu-†ùra} xêzy5le} plíšela m-©ðàðe.} ‘He had gone up into the
       mountains to hunt. T>tar-i Sleman-i S6ndi came from Iran. He
       came into the mountains, found him and they fought together.’

       contents) of her room.’ (A21:5)

       She (the servant) had left a tray there. A cat came in, fell into the
       glasses.’ (A4:53)The construction is sometimes used in narratives in combination with a
qa†6l form that expresses a perfective historical present, e.g.  (12) ""u-""áwwa j8ket d-o-K>rim-addìn} píšt5wa w9d6r,} ""áp-""ay †5šíla dêmma.}
       ‘The jacket of Karimaddin had remained outside. They daubed
       it in blood.’ (A14:20)The past resultative may also be used in combination with a compound
q†il5le form that functions as a present resultative (present perfect). In such
cases the past resultative expresses the background state against which the
event of the present resultative took place. As discussed in §15.4.1.2., the
present resultative does not primarily assert this event, but rather asserts
the resultant state with the event itself being an implicature. In these
contexts it is not appropriate to translate the past resultative into English
by a past perfect, e.g.  (13) ""ána mutt7°6nwa yomán6 šàb°a} ""u-mutt7°6nwa yomán6t yàrxa.} ""áti xa-béta
       hot-šqíl6lla m6n-šàb°a} píše ""6štà-yome.} ""u-xa-lèxma hot-šqíl6lle m6n-yàrxa,}

       You have taken an egg from the week and they have become six
       days. You have taken a loaf of bread from the month, and they
       have become twenty-nine days.’ (A17:15)The construction may be used in combination with a form expressing
habitual action in the past. Here it must be interpreted as having a dis-
tributive sense, denoting the background state of each of the set of actions
denoted by the habitual verb, e.g.  (14) ""áni b6drá°a tàma náše ""i-raqðíwa.} sab-wíð6lwala ""8ra dàšta} ""u-maßíwa
       náše doqíwa †¬à} ""arbà-reze xá-xa-gaye.} ‘The people would dance

tion, the past copula is moved in certain circumstances.
   In the text corpus examples are found of the leftward movement of
the past copula to a gradable quantifier in (15), and to an interrogative
constituent (16):  (15) ""í°wale xa-kàrma.} zríy6nwale b-i°à°i} ""u-ráb6nwa k‘íxa bíye dìye.} ha-t-

  (16) ""ína ""ána l-mòdinwa ßèlya?} ‘Why had I gone down?’ (A26:35)Note that in (15) the nuclear stress remains at the end of the intonation
group, marking a broad focus of the whole predicate. The effect of the
copula movement onto the quantifier (ráb6nwa) is to give this quantifier
particular prominence within this broad focus for the sake of intensify-
ing it.
  In (17) the copula is attached to the object x6††a ‘plan’ also without the
nuclear stress. In this case the function of the copula is to express topi-
cal rather than focal prominence. The item has forward pointing topical
prominence in that it is linked to the following complement clause:  (17) xè††a-wewa mùtta} yá'ni tré q6qwáne b-xà-kepa maxéwa.} ‘He had set a
       plan to kill two birds with one stone.’ (A8:35)The leftward movement of the copula is also attested in relative and other
subordinate clauses introduced by the particle D, e.g.  (18) xá-bena ""an-tre-maláxe t-w7wa ""è°ye bìya,} t-w7wa mutèpq6lla b-©ðàðe,} °éla

of this construction is to give particular prominence to the predicate as
a whole. The action of the hound is pivotal, in that it prevents the man
performing his day’s work:  (24) tullèk°a síqta š-xà-""isar5wa.} ‘The hound had gone up onto a rock.’

This construction is used to express a state resulting from a prior action that
is of habitual occurrence. It is frequently found in the descriptive text B5.
In this text the speaker generally uses it to elaborate on a habitual situation
that has been referred to in the immediately preceding discourse, e.g.  (1)   y-asqíwa malw6šíwale jull-dìye} ""u-y-atwìwa.} y-áwa wíðe xa-rámša yòma.}
        y-áwa wíðe dùxwa.} ‘They would come up (from the river) and dress

        feathers.’ (B5:46–47)In (1) the ""i-qa†6lwa/qa†6lwa verbs in the first half of the passage express
habitual actions in the past that occurred in temporal sequence. In (2) qa†6l

the second half of the passages the y-awe q†ila forms express states result-
ing from previous events that habitually exist when the aforementioned
habitual actions take place. They are used to elaborate on the scene that
has been evoked. By virtue of being states they must be interpreted as
attendant circumstances rather than dynamic events that are temporally
sequential to what precedes. It should be noted that the speaker uses the
present auxiliary y-awe even when the preceding verbs are past tense forms,
as in (1). In such cases it takes the past tense reference of the preceding
verbal forms as its deictic centre. This reflects the dependency of the
construction on the preceding discourse. Further examples:  (3) béna m5°7wa m5xòlta.} m5xólta y-áwa mbúšle qawúrma-w rêzza,} ""u-k6ftàne.}

adjectival interpretation, as is the case with tiwe in (7) and dmixa in (8):  (7) fa-kul-náše kút-xa m5°éwa x>dáye díye ""u-mattúwa tàma.} ""u-y-áwa tíwe nàše}

The examples of this construction that are attested in the text corpus
mostly contain a resultative participle that functions as a predicative adjec-
tive. The construction expresses a state that habitually existed in the past.
It often presents the attendant circumstances or background of a habitual
event that is expressed by a ""i-qa†6l/qa†6l form, e.g.  (1)   ""i-bašèlwa y-awèxwa tíwe mbarxòše,} ""úmma šênne!} ‘It would cook (while)
        we would be sitting stirring it, for a hundred years!’ (B10:12)
  (2)   qayêmwa} qáša y-awéwa zína qamàye.} ""u-""ó-t šamáše bá°re bà°re.} ‘(When)
        the resurrection was celebrated (literally: He arose), the priest would
        be standing at the front and the deacons behind him.’ (B5:55)
  (3)   képa m5°7wa m-gu-†ùra.} y-azíwa l-†ùra} y-awéwa †êšya ""aw-képa} mattíwa

        would go to the mountains. The stone used to be hidden, so they
        would plant gunpowder.’ (B5:179)It expresses a habitual property of the subject referent rather than an
event and so does not express sequentiality. This is shown in (4), where the
form y-oyáwa dmìxta expresses a habitual property that is not presented as
sequential to that of eating, whereas the series of qa†6lwa forms y-axlàwa-w}
damxàwa} may be interpreted as denoting sequential events:  (4)   ""í°wale xa-bràta.} gu-b7°a har-y-oyáwa dmìxta} ""u-xàla,} dmíxta-w xàla.}

This form is attested only sporadically in the text corpus. In (1) it is found
in a construction with the word balki ‘perhaps’, in (2) it occurs in a relative
clause with a generic antecedent and in (3) in a purpose clause:  (1) bálki háwe ""è°ya l-b5°-qòra.} ‘Perhaps he has gone to the cemetery.’

This construction is attested mainly in conditional sentences. It may denote
a state resulting from a single perfective event, in which case it has a
counterfactual sense (1–2). It is also used in factual conditions to denote
a habitual state resulting from habitual, iterative events (3):  (1) ""6n-""ána hawènwa q†íl6lla "">yáha ""aqêrwa,} ""áwwa xúwwe t-awéwa q†íla

      (B10:19)It is also used in counterfactual contexts outside of conditional construc-
tions, e.g.  (4) ""ána g8r6g hawènwa spày zúze šqíla.} ‘I should have got a good sum of
      money.’ (B1:19)
  (5) t-lá-haw6nwa mbúqr6ll5xu biš-spày.} ‘It would have been better for me

700                            chapter fifteenIt is attested in deontic constructions expressing an unfulfilled wish, which
is related to its function in counterfactual conditions, e.g.  (6) káwa xoš-t-awéwa pìša.} ‘He should have remained alive.’ (A7:20)15.4.1.6.5. t-awe q†ila ( future)
In the text corpus there are some examples of the future form of t-awe
(< b6d-hawe) combined with the resultative participle of intransitive telic
verbs. The function of such constructions is to express an imperfective
future, denoting a continuous state, e.g.  (1) hát ""álaha yálli rèsqi b-áyya kàwe,} ""àxxa t-áw6n dmíxa.} ‘Until God
      gives me my sustenance through this window, I shall sleep here.’
      (A10:5)
  (2) ""6ští-š6nne xéne t-óya r6š-d-7-qora tíwta bxàya.} ‘She will sit for another
      sixty years weeping over that grave.’ (A4:45)15.4.1.6.6. t-awewa q†ila
This is attested in the apodosis of counterfactual conditionals denoting a
hypothetical perfective event in the past, e.g.  (1) ""o-š6ndóxa ""èn-hawewa qí°a bìyi} t-awètwa q†ìl6lli.} ‘If that rock had hit
      me, you would have killed me.’ (A1:25)15.4.1.6.7. wele q†ila
The combination of the resultative participle with the q†ille form of hwy
is found only sporadically. It is attested in (1), where the speaker appears
to be using it to give some degree of temporal limitation to the resultant
state of a past action, i.e. it was the case that they made a fence, but now
they want to make something else:  (1) hadíya ""5-dùk°a} wéla wíð6lla xa-šùra,} ""áx‘i b8yi ""oðìla} xa-šúra bìš-go‰a.}
      ‘Now as for that place, they made a fence for it, but they want to
      make a bigger fence for it.’ (B3:22)15.4.1.7. The Resultative Participle of the Verb hwy
The resultative construction may contain the resultative participle of the
verb hwy. Various functions of this can be distinguished.
                             the syntax of verbs                                701(i) ‘to become’
When used with an ascriptive or identificatory predicate, it has an ingres-
sive sense of ‘becoming’, expressing a present resultative state, e.g.  (1) l5t-""áti wíya xoš-náša t-it-mú°y6lla ""ánna zùze.} záwna wíy5le t-šlàma.} ‘You
      have not become a good man and brought these coins. The time
      has become one of peace.’ (A1:26)
  (2) bálki qam-dána háwa wíye xèzme m-©ðàðe.} ‘Perhaps beforehand they
      have become relatives of one another.’ (B5:5)
  (3) †alána yá'ni †alàna,} sab-šèmša ""7-g6t maxyàwa} †uráne ""àtx5na wíye.} ‘(The
      word) †alana means ‘shady’, since when the sun would strike the
      mountains, they became like that.’ (B3:2)Note that in (3) the resultative form is used in an apodosis of a temporal
sentence that contains a habitual verb in the first clause (maxyàwa). The
resultative must have a distributive sense, i.e. on each occasion when
the sun struck the mountains, they became like that. Furthermore, since
the resultative expresses a state, it cannot be interpreted as a sequential
event but rather as an temporally overlapping situation (literally: ‘At the
time when the sun struck the mountains, they have become like that’).(ii) Existential Function
The form may be used to express the coming into existence of the subject.
When the subject is inanimate, the verb has the sense of ‘happening’,
e.g.  (1) ""áp-""ayya p-aqènna ""êllux,} sab-wít5la b-réši ""up-àyya.} ‘I shall tell you also
      about this, since this also happened to me.’ (B15:85)
  (2) rába gáye wít5la ""ánna m6ndiyàne.} ‘Many times such things happened.’
      (B5:163)
  (3) hadíya mtán6x xa-qêßß6t} t-íla wíta gu-ˇiyàre} qám-plaša qamàya.} ‘Now
      we’ll tell a story that happened in ˇiyare before the First World
      War.’ (B17:1)
  (4) ""ˆ-ga} ""ánna m6ndiyáne wìyela.} ‘Those things happened at that time.’
      (A19:9)In (1) and (2) the events in question took place at a time that is remote
from the present, but they are presented from the perspective of the
speaker at the present moment. They can be interpreted as ‘experiential
perfects’, i.e. events that are part of the speaker’s life experience or at
702                             chapter fifteenleast events that he has heard about in his life. Examples (3) and (4) are
narrative uses of the resultative construction that are equivalent in func-
tion to the q†ille form (§15.4.1.3.).
   When the subject of the verb is animate, it has the sense of ‘to be
born’, e.g.  (5) šet6-†è¬¬6° wìt5la} S6ttìye.} ‘In the third year S6ttiye was born.’ (A25:25)
  (6) ""ím6 t-íla wíta S6ttìye,} ""áy biš-xám°5la m-kùlla.} ‘When S6ttiye was born,
      she was the most beautiful of all.’ (A25:26)
  (7) b-ay-dána lànwa wí°a.} ‘At that time I was not born.’ (B10:45)(iii) Temporal Expressions
In narratives, the construction sometimes takes a nominal denoting a period
of time as its subject in clauses that set the temporal frame for what fol-
lows. The subject nominals are placed after the verbal form, e.g.  (1) wíy5le yóm6t †¬à°a} ""áwwa f†ìr5le} ""u-plì†5le.} ‘(When) the third day came,
      he had breakfast and went out.’ (A22:24)
  (2) wít5la qèdamta,} jènne ""ê°yela,} šqìl6lla Zíne} nùbl6lla Jazíra Bóta.} ‘In the
      morning, the jinn came and took Zine, took her away to Jazira
      Bota.’ (A26:8)
  (3) wít5la qedámta sá""6t ""árpa b-lˆle,} ‰ìš5le} màlka.} ‘(When) the morning
      came, four o’clock in the morning, the king woke up.’ (A17:27)
  (4) wít5la dán6t mabròye,} tèrw6°na mubrèla} hàr ""o-yóma.} ‘(When) the time of
      giving birth came, they both gave birth on the same day.’ (A25:4)
  (5) wít5la dàna,} mìßela ""èrbe,} pá‰e m6n-y6mma°èy,} mère . . . } ‘(When) the season
      came and the sheep sucked, the lambs sucked from their mothers,
      he said . . .’ (A25:26)As has been discussed in §15.4.1.3., the resultative form can be used in
narrative with the function of a preterite rather than a present perfect.
Judging by cases such as (4) above, however, where the following clause
is in the q†ille form, it would appear that the resultative forms wiy5le and
wit5la here have their basic function of expressing a resultant state rather
than an event, i.e. the state against the background of which the event
described in what follows took place. In (1)–(5) the verbs can be interpreted
as existential forms of hwy, correponding to the previous category (‘the
third day happened’). The gender agreement between the initial verb
                             the syntax of verbs                                703form and the following temporal noun demonstrates that the noun is the
grammatical subject.
   Various examples are attested that exhibit a development of the afore-
mentioned construction, whereby the resultative of the verb hwy is used
before an adverbial prepositional phrase or an adverbial clause, which
cannot function as the grammatical subject. In such cases the verb has
a 3fs. form, which must be an impersonal subject, with the adverbial
functioning as the predicate, e.g.  (6)   wít5la b-lˆle} maláxa m5‰èšle qa-ràbb6n.} ‘In the night the angel woke
        the monk.’ (A15:11)
  (7)   wít5la b-lˆle} xúwwe °èle.} ‘In the night the snake came.’ (A24:40)
  (8)   xa-béna wít5la hád6x b-lˆle} mèxy5le taq-taq-táq l-t9ra.} ‘Then, at night,
        there was a knock at the door.’ (A23:26)
  (9)   wít5la bar-""o-náša sáwa ßèly5le mt>mòz6lla ë6nn6k7ra díya,} ""áp-""aw ßèly5le
        mhayóre ta-d-o-sàwa.} ‘After that old man went down to clean around
        it, he also went down to help the old man.’ (A14:77)In (10) the two constructions are combined, in that it contains both a
prepositional phrase and a nominal without a preposition:  (10) wít5la b-lˆle,} dána t-dmàxa,} xílela mêndi.} wít5la dána t-dmàxa,} x6mmêr°a,}
       x6mmèr°6 šên°a} šqìlt6lla,} mutt7°6lla r6š-ßádr6t xmá°a dìya.} ‘At night,
       the time of sleep, they ate something. At the time of sleep, she
       (Leli°a) took a bead, a bead of sleep, and put it on the chest of
       her mother-in-law’. (A19:3)In the discourse structure of narratives, constructions with initial adverbi-
als discussed in this section are disjunctive in function and mark the onset
of new episode.(iv) Combined with the Existential Particle
When the verb has an existential function, the copula is sometimes replaced
by the existential particle (""i°, li°), e.g.  (1)   lí° wíya ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘Nothing has happened.’ (A29:22)
  (2)   lì° hátxa mèndi wíya gu-mðíta.} ‘Nothing like that has happened in
        the town.’ (A22:2)
704                            chapter fifteenSuch constructions may refer to a situation that arises through a series
of recurrent events, e.g.  (3) ""í°wa rába xlulàne} wíye gu-mà°a.} ‘Many weddings took place in the
      village.’ (B15:73)15.4.2. The Infinitive Combined with the Verb ‘to be’15.4.2.1. General Remarks
The infinitive may be combined with the various copulas and inflections
of the verb hwy to form a compound verbal form.
   This construction originated historically as a locative predication, with
the locative preposition b- ‘in’ attached to the infinitive. In some NENA
dialects this preposition is still regularly used with the infinitive in the
construction, e.g. C. Urmi b-grašel6 ‘he is pulling’, but in C. Barwar the
preposition is normally elided and is only heard sporadically. Examples
attested in the text corpus include:  (1) hóle b-°áya ""axêll5xu.} ‘He is coming to eat you.’ (A13:14)
  (2) †ˆre} hóla b-°áya l-qàle.} ‘The birds are coming at (the sound of ) his
      voice.’ (A25:43)
  (3) ""u-†árp6t d5rúb6r hóla b-n°àra.} ‘The leaves of the wood are falling.’
      (A25:46)
  (4) b-xyára b-zeðàye.} ‘He looks at the pitta breads.’ (A30:11)
  (5) b-txár6n ‘I remember’ (B15:84)The b- is regularly used only in the fixed phrase b-xšaw5n ‘I think’.","[728, 729, 730, 731, 732, 733, 734, 735, 736, 737, 738, 739, 740, 741, 742, 743]"
"16.1.5. Material
It is occasionally used to denote the material out of which something is
made, e.g.  (1)   t-oðètli gèšra b-qˆsa.} ‘Make me a bridge of wood.’ (A17:18)
796                            chapter sixteen16.1.6. Price
It denotes the price at which an item is fixed either in an amount of
money or a bartered object, e.g.  (1) xá-kilo ""èxre b-†¬á°a dàw5le.} ‘One kilo of dung sells for three gold
      pieces.’ (A7:14)
  (2) ""ána zonènna b-""êßra.} ‘I shall buy it for ten (dinars).’ (B5:42)
  (3) xál6t xètna q6m-zawènna ""ilána b-xamšì dináre.} ‘The maternal uncle of
      the groom has bought it (the tree) for a hundred dinars.’ (B15:68)
  (4) l-Yaws6p zwinta b-neriya. ‘It has been bought by Yaws6p for a male
      goat.’ (B8:28)Conversely it is used before the item sold in expressions such as (5):  (5) y-a°éwa zonàna,} y-amêrwa} ""àyya} ""àtxa b-yawènnux bíya díya.} ‘A purchaser
      would come and say “I shall give you such-and-such (an amount
      of money) for them (the apples).” ’ (B15:52)16.1.7. Manner
It may express the manner in which an action is performed. In such cases
it is generally combined with an abstract nominal, e.g.  (1) maßl7l6n b-iqàra.} ‘They bring us down with honour.’ (A4:30)
  (2) b8y6n lá-""a°i b-xàšša.} ‘I do not want them to come in sadness.’
      (A4:33)
  (3) ""áni b-x7la b8yi mbarxíla ""êlli.} ‘They want to marry her to me by

      in truth, how have you made this girl a housewife.’ (A21:34)16.1.8. Causal Background
Occasionally it expresses the cause or purpose of an action, e.g.  (1) ""ám6r b-àyy6t mšúdr6lli?} ‘Was it for this (reason) you sent for me?’
      (A21:32)
  (2) zílle b-ríx6t k>bàbe,} xzéle mdaxóye xmàre.} ‘He went after the smell of

      gu-""ˆni?} ‘Are you not the girl on account of whom I made myself
      blind, by puttinng the needle into my eye?’ (A16:7)16.1.9. Oath
The preposition is used in oaths or adjurations before the item by which
the speaker is swearing, e.g.  (1) mèra b-rèšux.} ""áti mútt6t-6lle tàma.} ‘She said “(I swear) by your head.
      You put him there.” ’ (A22:39)The preposition is most frequently used with this function before the
noun ""alaha ‘God’ in the phrase b-álaha, which is usually stressed on the
first syllable and often pronounced [b-a[la]. This expression is used in a
variety of contexts. In general it strengthens an assertion, by committing
the speaker fully to the truth of the statement, e.g.  (2) b-álaha ""áwwa xoš-yàl5le.} ‘By God, he is a good lad.’ (A21:5)
  (3) b-álaha d°s-it.} ‘By God, you are right.’ (A17:19)It is often used to introduce the response to a question, e.g.  (4) ""o-tèla} mère há lˆk6t zála,} ya-gáni dêbba?} b-álaha xðár6n bá°6r rêsqi.} ‘The
      fox said “Hey, where are you going, my dear bear?” “By God, I’m

      is her story?” He said “By God, her story is like this.” ’ (A4:14)It is used to strengthen a remonstration expressed by a negative question,
e.g.  (7) b-álaha látwa mìrta} la-h7w6n ""u-lá b6‰-náša ""áw6r gu-""òt6x?} ‘By God, did
      you not say that no animal and no person should enter the room?’
      (A23:22)
798                            chapter sixteen16.1.10. Complements of Verbs and Expressions
The preposition b- is used as the complement of some verbs, e.g. dbaša
b- ‘to stick to’, dqara b- ‘to touch’, mbaxole b- ‘to envy’, mhaymone b- ‘to
believe in’, mparoje b- ‘to look at’, tfaqa b- ‘to meet’, †paya b- ‘to catch
onto (fire)’, parpore b- ‘to plead to’, qya°a b- ‘to hit’, tpara b- ‘to threaten’,
xðaya b- ‘to rejoice in’, xkaka/gxaka b- ‘to laugh at’, xqara b- ‘to honour’,
xyara b- ‘to look at’. It is also used as the obligatory complement of some
attributive expressions, e.g. bista b- ‘familiar with’, bliga b- ‘busy with’, x6ðya
b- ‘pleased with’.
   Several verbs may take a direct object complement or a complement
introduced by the preposition b-. In general the construction with the
prepositional complement is used to express a situation in which the action
affects the referent to a lesser extent than when a direct complement is
used, or a situation in which the action is less directly associated with the
referent. Some pairs are given below by way of illustration:
   ðaya + object ‘to know, understand (sth., so. by direct knowledge)’, ðaya
b-‘to know about (sth. so. indirectly)’, e.g.  (1) y6ðènne ""á°‰6t bàbi.} ‘I know the land of my father.’ (A14:90)
  (2) hé b-àlaha,} qídle b7°6t duglàna-w} ""áxni là-ðiye bíye.} ‘Oh, by God, the
      house of the liar has burnt down, without us knowing about it.’
      (A48:7)mxaya + object ‘to strike’, mxaya b- ‘to play (a musical instrument)’, e.g.  (3) lá maxênn6x.} ‘I shall not strike you.’ (A51:19)
  (4) ""Ašeba†àlo} ""áwwa máxe b-zòrna.} ‘Ašeba†alo played the pipe’ (A25:26)mšaxlope + object ‘to change’, mšaxlope b- ‘to exchange’, e.g.  (5) ta-mšaxèlpi šèmm6t ’ùxo} ‘in order for them to change the name ’uxo’
      (A7:3)
  (6) mšuxlèpla b-is6qyà°a.} ‘They exchanged rings.’ (A4:5)zmara + object ‘to sing (a song)’, zmara b- ‘to sing to (so.)’, e.g.  (7) ""i-zamríwa ràwe.} ‘They used to sing rawe.’ (B15:75)
  (8) zmírre b-Zìne.} ‘He sang to Zine.’ (A25:22)

  (10) ""u-rípel6lle kùlla,} nyása-w xàla ""èbbe-diye.} ‘They (the animals) all
       attacked him, biting and eating bits of him (= gnawing him).’
       (A35:21)Some verbs can take a direct object or another preposition but use b- before
a referent that is disadvantaged in some way by the action, e.g.  (11) †la-mò wídlux hátxa bíyi?} ‘Why have you done this to me?’
       (A15:14)
  (12) xzi-málka bt-áw6ð bìyi.} ‘See, the king will do (something) to me.’
       (A21:33)
  (13) ""áp-""ana šqiláli š6ndùxta} d6ryáli bìya.} ‘I picked up a small stone and
       threw it at it.’ (A23:22)
  (14) ""áp-xa l5le-mßáya bíya dìya.} ‘Nobody could (do anything) against her
       (= nobody could defeat her).’ (A25:68)
  (15) šuréla ßráxa bíye dìye.} ‘She started shouting at him.’ (A25:82)
  (16) bálki t-íle xa-mèndi °í°a bìya.} ‘Perhaps something has happened to
       her.’ (A21:25)The preposition with the sense of ‘disadvantage’ is found after the exis-
tential particle in expressions such as:  (17) ""ána bsìmli} ‘ú-mdi li°-bìyi.} ‘I am cured. Nothing is the matter with
       me.’ (A4:20)With some verbs the preposition b- may be exchanged for other preposi-
tions to express a different relationship to the complement. In (18), for
example, the verb xyara ‘to look’ takes a complement with b- (‘look at’),
but in the second clause the complement has gu- to express ‘looking into’
the enclosed interior of the cave:  (18) qamáye xírta b-áql6t súsa dìya,} la-xírra gu-gêppa.} ‘At first she looked at
       the legs of her horse, she did not look into the cave.’ (A8:72)
800                             chapter sixteen16.1.11. b6d-, bud-
The expression b6d- and its variant bud- is in origin a combination of the
preposition b- and the subordinating particle D. It is not, however, used
with exactly the same distribution as the basic preposition b-. It gener-
ally has the sense of ‘about, concerning’, which is not a meaning that is
generally expressed by b- alone, e.g.  (1)   ""6n-xá-naša m7°elaxu xàbra} b6d-bròni,} kut-m5°éli xábra b6d-bròni,} ""6n-mí°a
        ""6n-ßàxi,} pálg6t dáwi de-t-yánne ""èlle dìye.} ‘If somebody brings you word
        about my son—whoever brings me word about my son, whether
        he is dead or alive, I’ll give him half of my gold.’ (A14:92)
  (2)   ""ánna šèmye-wawa b6d-M8mo m6n-Zìne.} ‘They had heard about M>mo
        from Zine.’ (A26:25)
  (3)   šmìla bud-díye.} ‘They heard about him.’ (A21:5)
  (4)   lá taxmènn6n ""ána b6d-z6ndàna.} ‘I shall not think about prison (= I
        don’t care about prison).’ (A26:44)
  (5)   náše spáy t-y8ði bud-màrra} ‘fine people who know about the illness’
        (A8:32)
  (6)   qím6n molèxm6nna ""ánna šére bud-dìye.} ‘I composed these verses about
        him.’ (C4:3)
  (7)   b6d-""áwwa náša tàlx6x.} ‘Let’s destroy with regard to this man (= let’s
        get rid of this man).’ (A30:41)Elsewhere the phrase is occasionally used to denote relations that are
expressed by the basic b- preposition, including causal (‘because of, on
account of ’), instrumental (‘through the means of ’) and comitative (‘with’),
e.g.  (8)  bud-àyya mu°7lux ""ánna zúze.} ‘Because of this you have brought these
       coins.’ (A1:27)
  (9) rába ""ítley xayú°a basímta b6d-àyya,} yá'ni zrát6t xabùše.} ‘They had a
       very good life on account of this, that is the cultivation of apples.’
       (B5:106)
  (10) y-axlíwa lèxma bêd-an q7se.} ‘They would eat bread through the means
       of (the sale of ) this wood.’ (A14:10)
  (11) ""áwwa rèši} t-á°e xá-yoma pràma} b6d-""i°á°a dìyux.} ‘This head of mine
       will one day be cut off by your hands.’ (A14:35)
  (12) qímla k°úla xa-k°àwa,} mšudèrra b6d-qàz6d.} ‘She wrote a letter and
       sent it by a messenger.’ (A11:17)

       water.’ (B5:100)In addition it is found in a few fixed expressions, e.g.  (14) qím5le híw6lla bná°e dìye} †la-d-an-nàše,} b6d-xá†6r d-ó-xona zòra.} ‘He gave
       his daughters to those people on account of that young brother.’

  (15) har-dmíxt5la b6d-lèbba gu-b7°6t bába dìy5la.} ‘She continued sleeping,
       thinking that she was in her father’s house.’ (A21:18)16.1.12. Combined with Other Prepositions
The preposition b- is often combined with the locative preposition reš-
‘upon’, e.g.  (1)   hóle dèrya jùlla b-réša.} ‘He put a cloth over them.’ (A25:48)
  (2)   qím5le zíla mútta ""án-julla díya gu-d-o-sandùqa,} mútt6lla gu-""asàs6t b7°a,}
        ""u-bèny5le gùda b-réše.} ‘He put her clothes in a box and placed it in
        the foundations of the house, then built a wall over it.’ (A14:99)
                                     16.2. L-This preposition has a wide variety of functions. One reason for this is
that it is derived from two different prepositions in earlier Aramaic, namely
*l-‘to, for’ and *'al ‘upon’. Generally the usage of l- in the dialect makes it
clear from which of these two earlier prepositions it is derived in any one
particular case. In some cases, however, the derivation is not completely
certain. For this reason all the usages of l- are here treated together. It is
important, furthermore, to make a distinction between the adnominal uses
of l- and the adpronominal forms. Various possibilities exist for pronomi-
nalizing a phrase consisting of l + nominal. These include the L-suffixes
and independent phrases consisting of ""6ll- + pronominal suffixes. Each
of these pronominal forms has a restricted usage and is not found in all
contexts that l + nominal phrases are used.
802                           chapter sixteen16.2.1. Adnominal Uses16.2.1.1. Destination
The preposition l- is frequently used in the complement of a verb of
movement to express the destination, e.g.  (1)   ""áwwa qíma zíla l-bˆ°e díye.} ‘He went to his house.’ (A17:6)
  (2)   ""è°y5le l-bˆ°a.} ‘He came home.’ (A17:20)
  (3)   si-dú‰ l-šòpux.} ‘Go back to your place.’ (A15:20)
  (4)   ha-t-""á°e ""o-náša qamàya} má†e l-""ˆna} ""á°e xa-náša sàwa.} ‘Before the
        first man reached the spring, an old man came.’ (A15:3)
  (5)   dèqne díye m†áya l-9ra.} ‘His beard reached the ground.’ (A15:13)
  (6)   t-ásq6x l-áwwa †ùra?} ‘Shall we go up to this mountain?’ (A17:4)
  (7)   masqánne l-bˆ°a.} ‘I shall take it up to the house.’ (A22:19)
  (8)   °éla ßlèla} l-""árx6t be-Xàmmo.} ‘She came down to the water-mill of
        the family of Xammo.’ (A19:1)
  (9)   ’úxo híwle bále l-bˆ°a.} ‘’uxo set off for home.’ (A7:12)In some cases the movement has a purposive sense, e.g.  (10) lá-""az6t l-q7se b-xáwl6t xàwrux.} ‘Do not go to (collect) wood with the
       rope of your friend.’ (D2:71)16.2.1.2. Direction
It may be used to express, broadly, the direction or objective of an action
without any clear movement towards the complement of the preposition
being invovled. It should be noted, however, that the relation of recipient
or beneficiary is normally expressed by the prepositions ta/†la- or qa- when
the complement is a nominal:  (1)   ràbb6n} ""áwwa t-i-sàx6ð l-""álaha.} ‘A monk is somebody who worships
        God.’ (A15:4)
  (2)   dráya búxt6n l-xá l-d-o-xèna} ‘slandering this one and that one’
        (A48:5)
  (3)   dréla šláma l-f9qih.} ‘She greeted the jurist.’ (A22:16)
  (4)   ""álaha šuxa-l-šèmme ‘God—praise be to his name’ (A6:10)
  (5)   ""ána †líbt6nwa l-brón6t màmi.} ‘I was engaged to my cousin.’ (A13:14)

In numerous cases l- has the sense of ‘upon’ or ‘on’, denoting a spatial
location above or, at least, on the surface of the referent that it governs.
The preposition in such cases is clearly derived from *'al:  (1)   hóle tíwa l-kèpa.} ‘He is sitting on a stone.’ (A15:13)
  (2)   bròn-málka tíw5le l-d-a-tàxta.} ‘The son of the king sat on the throne.’
        (A14:43)

  (4)   párxa ""átwa l-gàre.} ‘She flew up and sat on the roof.’ (A14:101)
  (5)   klí°a l-márz6 d-a-j>zìra.} ‘It came to rest on the shore of the island.’
        (A14:39)
  (6)   máxewa darmàna} l-ßàwle.} ‘He used to put polish on shoes.’ (A16:1)
  (7)   míla l-hàlux!} ‘Blue on your condition! (= Confound you!)’ (A23:10)In certain contexts, where the verb involves movement, the preposition
has a sense of ‘onto’,  (8)  sìq5le} l-gàre.} ‘He went up onto the roof.’ (A25:52)
  (9)  ta-d7rela l-xáß6t xmàre} ‘in order that he puts them onto the back of
       his donkey’ (A23:13)
  (10) mattíwala l-""9ra.} ‘They would put it onto the ground.’ (A12:3)In constructions with the verb mxy used with the sense of ‘applying’ a
substance to something, the adnominal preposition l- may be used with
the item upon which the substance is applied (11) or a transposition may
take place as in (12), in which the preposition is placed on the nominal
expressing the substance:  (11) máxewa darmàna} l-ßàwle.} ‘He used to put polish on shoes.’
       (A16:1)
  (12) ""u-mèxy6x6lla má°6n kúlla l-míla-w l-kóma m-bá°re dìye.} ‘and we have
       covered all our village with blue and black after him (= after his
       departure).’ (A4:32)In some cases where the preposition l- corresponds to *'al in earlier Ara-
maic it has the sense of ‘concerning, about’, e.g.  (13) mbaqóre l-d-ò-naša:} ""ìtle bróna?} ‘He was inquiring concerning the
       man: Has he a son?’ (A8:5)
804                             chapter sixteen16.2.1.4. General Spatial Location
In some cases it denotes a static spatial location without any implication
of being ‘above’ in a higher position, e.g.  (1)   hóle ""àrya} l-àyya góta} ""u-""êzza} hóla l-àyya góta.} ‘There is a lion on this
        side and a she-goat on the other side.’ (A24:15)
  (2)   ""u-xmáre l-gòte-diye} ‘with his ass at his side’ (A7:6)
  (3)   l-a-pá°a xét6t nèra} ""í° xa-má°6t huðàye.} ‘On the other side of the river
        there is a village of Jews.’ (A14:50)

  (9)   ""u-šawqíwale l-šêmša.} ‘and they would leave it in the sun.’ (B7:20)We could include here the adverbial laxxa ‘here’, which has been formed
from l- + ""axxa and may be used to denote static location. The l- that
is often used with the particle of isolation xoð- (§14.6.) also falls in this
category, e.g.  (10) pìšela} har-""àni-tre l-xoðéy.} ‘Only those two remained by themselves.’

Independent subject pronouns are on some occasions postposed after the
verb or copula predicate. This construction expresses greater continuity
and cohesion with the preceding discourse than the construction where
the pronoun stands before the verb.
   In many cases the motivation for this additional coding appears to be
to give prominence to the clause as a whole, due to its importance or
unexpectedness. Sometimes the prominent clause is the final one of a
series, e.g.  (1)   ""ána spayù°6n wáða,} ""u-""èdyo m†éli ""ána làxxa.} ‘I was doing good and
        today I have come here.’ (A14:34)
  (2)   ""ày} ""u-xolamwà°a} kúlla rqáða ©ðáðe zmàra,} mára xa-'>b≈d kòma} dmáx5la
        mènne díye ""ày.} ‘She and her servants all danced and sang together.
        She slept with a black slave.’ (A13:8)
  (3)   ""í° xa-yàla,} ""ána mquwált6n mênne} g8r6g gawrànne,} g8r6g d7‰6n ""ána
        l-tàma.} ‘There is a young man. I gave him a promise and I must
        marry him, I must return there.’ (A14:86)
  (4)   hey-nàša} la-""àz6t} ""á°e mtalèxlux ""àw.} ‘Don’t go, man. He will come
        and destroy you.’ (A14:65)
  (5)   m-ˆka q6m-y>ðètli ""áti t-íw6n Gozáli?} ‘How did you know that I was
        Gozali?’ (A8:41)
  (6)   xóni dàw6qlux} darélux gu-z6ndàna,} gu-hàbsa.} mère lá taxmènn6n ""ána
        b6d-z6ndàna.} ‘ “My brother will seize you and put you in prison,
        in jail.” He said “I don’t care about prison.” ’ (A26:43–44)A postposed second person subject pronoun is used with imperatives to
give added force to the command, e.g.  (7)   qu-plú† ""àti} xzi-mò-d-ila qèßß6t.} ‘Go out and see what is happening.’
        (A26:54)
  (8)   túg6n ""áti gàwe} ‘Sit in it!’ (A20:3)
  (9)   háyyo ßlí K>r≈m ""áti gu-d-áwwa balù'a.} ‘Come Karim, go down into
        this conduit.’ (A14:16)
                                    the clause                                     871In some cases the pronoun is used to give prominence to the subject
referent for contrastive purposes. This is not a narrow new information
focus on the subject, since the predicate is not presuppositional. Rather
it should be regarded as a form of topical prominence. The construction
is used to give the subject added distinctness where the activity of the
subject is set up in a contrastive opposition to that of another referent.
In (10), for example, there are two characters on the scene, a man and a
woman. The man goes to sleep whereas the woman remains awake. The
construction dmìx5le ""áw} with the postposed pronoun expresses cohesive
temporal sequence to what precedes, but underscores the fact that the
activity was undertaken by him and not her. In (11) the clause with the
postposed pronoun is, likewise, cohesive with what precedes, but the activ-
ity of the subject (a lioness) is set up in opposition to the activity of her
young, which is described in the following clause:  (10) kut-dán6t ""á°e xùwwe} m>r6šàtli.} mèra spày.} mára xa-bèna,} dmìx5le ""áw.}
       dmìx5le,} wít5la b-lˆle} xúwwe °èle.} ""áy bxèla.} ‘(He said) “When the
       snake comes, wake me.” She said “Fine” and he went to sleep.
       He went to sleep and during night the snake came. She wept.’
       (A24:39–40)
  (11) ßlì°5la ""arí°a,} ßráx5la, ßràxa.} ßlí°a šmìy6lla.} klì°5la-""ay.} bnóna díya ßèlye
       šètye mìy5la.} ‘The lionness came down, yelling. She came down and
       he heard her. She stood and her young went down and drank the
       water.’ (A33:10)It could be argued that the opposition between the two activities in cases
such as (10) and (11) is made distinct by increasing the prominence of
the proposition expressed by the clause as a whole and so the function
of the postposed pronoun is basically the same as in examples (1)–(9). It
is worth noting that in (11) the copula of the compound verbal construc-
tion is postposed to the end of the clause, which is a device used to give
prominence to the predicate as a whole (see §15.4.1.4.2.).
   When the independent 1pl. subject pronoun is postposed, the inten-
tion is often to express a contrastive prominence that gives the pronoun
an exclusive sense. This is typically used in clauses in which the pronoun
refers to the community of the speaker, which is distinct from the com-
munity of the hearer. This may be compared to the use of the ‘heavy
coding’ of the long 1pl. pronominal suffix -5ni to express the exclusive
1pl. In (12) and (13) the clauses with postposed 1pl. pronouns are cohesive
with what precedes:
872                            chapter seventeen  (12) ""elí°a m6n-""êrb6 xwára,} pà‰a,} ""êrbe,} la-""êzze,} lá ""an-kòme} y-amrèxla ""àxni.}
       ‘Tail fat is from white small cattle (sheep), a lamb, sheep, not goats,
       not black (small cattle), as we call them.’ (B10:5)
  (13) y-oðíwa pèške hátxa zòre,} ""o-t b>yéwa q>ràne.} pèške y-oðêxwa ""áxni,} ta-
       xàla.} ‘They would make pieces of meat small like this or, if people
       wanted, thick. We would make meat pieces for eating.’ (B10:7)In the constructions considered so far, the nuclear stress is often not placed
on the pronoun, even when the pronoun occurs at the end of an intona-
tion group. If, however, the postposed pronoun is a narrow focus of new
information, it always bears the nuclear stress, e.g.  (14) mèra †la-xa°wà°a,} xá°i ""àna pál†6n.} plí††5la ""ày.} ‘She said to her sisters
       “My sister, I shall go out.” She (not any of the others) went out.’
       (A12:67)
  (15) ""èdyo p7ša ""ày maxóle †la-náše.} ‘Today she (not other people) has begun
       to feed people.’ (A21:32)In many examples in the text corpus the narrow focus is inclusive, expressed
by the particle ""ap, e.g.  (16) t-yálli xa-šúla pálx6n ""àp-ana.} ‘He will give me a job so that also I
       can work.’ (A23:3)
  (17) xuš-p7š6n képa ""ap-""àna.} ‘Let me also turn into stone.’ (A8:55)
  (18) bróni qa†lètli ""ap-àti?} ‘My son, would also you kill me?’ (A28:34)
  (19) xon>wá°i mv8do mv9do} t-la-""azítu b-míya ""ap-àxtu.} ‘Brothers, move out
       of the way! Move out of the way, so that you also do not go with
       the water.’ (A39:12)Pronouns are postposed in constructions such as the following where they
are conjoined with other items:  (20) t-átw6x šát6x ""ána w-àti.} ‘so that we can sit and drink, you and me.’
       (A17:25)
  (21) plíx5t ""àti,} ""u-xmára-w tàwra.} ‘You, the ass and the ox have worked.’
       (A21:13)
  (22) ""u-qíme ""áw ""u-bròn-díye ""u-tre-w>zíre plí†e ßˆda.} ‘He, his son and two
       ministers went out hunting.’ (A14:36)
                                  the clause                             87317.7.5. Clauses with a Direct Object Constituent17.7.5.1. Verb—Direct Object
The default position for the placement of a direct object nominal is after
the verb, e.g.  (1) šáqli lˆša.} ‘They take the dough.’ (B6:46)
  (2) m7°6n ""ixàla.} ‘I shall bring food.’ (A26:30)
  (3) šaryáwa b>núda dìya.} ‘She would untie her bands.’ (A18:1)
  (4) bašlíwa rêzza.} ‘They would cook rice.’ (B7:3)
  (5) q6m-p>réla ""ˆne.} ‘He burst his eye.’ (A16:2)
  (6) mx5lált6lla ""ay-dùk°a.} ‘She cleaned that place.’ (A17:27)In most cases the nuclear stress is put on the object, as in the examples
above. When the object is definite in status, the speaker occasionally puts
the nucleus on the verb. The purpose of this is usually to give promi-
nence to the event expressed by the clause for some reason. In (7), for
example, the event is a remarkable act of strength performed by one of
the characters in the narrative. The clause in (8) has importance in the
discourse structure, in that it marks the onset of the climactic section of
the narrative in which the Leli°a monster is destroyed:  (7) na‘êlle ""o-š6ryóxa.} ‘He pulls the tether apart.’ (A28:20)
  (8) q6m-""aómàle t8ra.} ‘She closed the door.’ (A19:4)17.7.5.2. Object—Verb
The object is sometimes placed before the verb. A distinction should be
made between constructions where the fronted object is an information
focus marked by the nuclear stress and those in which it is not an infor-
mation focus and does not bear the nuclear stress.
   The latter type of construction without the nuclear stress on the fronted
object is used to perform two main functions, which may be designated
as ‘event-orientated’ and ‘topic-orientated’ respectively. When it has an
event-orientated function, it expresses an event or situation that has a close
cohesion with what precedes. The object in such cases has some referen-
tial link with the preceding discourse, either by explicit previous mention
or by some kind of associative anaphora. In narrative the construction
presents an event as occurring in close spatio-temporal sequence to the
preceding event, e.g.
874                           chapter seventeen  (1) ""u-šwíqle zúze díye táma zìlle.} °éle xa-xèna,} ""an-zúze šqilíle ""u-zìlle.}
      ‘He left his money there and went off. Another man came, took
      the money and went off.’ (A15:15)
  (2) yála °éle m6n-zrùta,} táwre m5ríle gu-gòma.} ""u-síqle ta-t-áx6l mêndi.}
      ‘The young man came back from his cultivating, put the oxen in
      the basement stable and went up to eat something.’ (A21:8)
  (3) ja-jálde qìm5le} ""u-zíla šqíl6lle ""o-q7sa rìxa} ""u-wír5le gu-d-o-bˆ°a} r6š-d-
      ò-dapa} ""u-t8ra óêmt6lle báre.} ‘He quickly got up, took the long
      stick and entered the room, by the board. She closed the door
      behind him.’ (A22:27)
  (4) mère mo-t-òð6x?} p5rmèxle ""o-zòra} t-axlêxle,} hal-""7-g6t t-áza dèbba m-tàma.}
      qímela ""o-zóra prìm6llela} ""u-xìl6llela.} ‘He said “What shall we do?
      Let’s slaughter the young one and eat him, (and wait) until the bear
      goes away from there.” They slaughtered the young one and ate
      it.’ (A20:7–8)The construction is also used to express close spatio-temporal cohesion
of habitual events in descriptive discourse, e.g.  (5) mar6x°ìla,} ""u-""i-šoqíla t>màha,} míya ""i-†7pi b-rèša.} míy6t †7pi b-réša
      b5zìla.} ‘They boil it and put it aside. The water comes to the top.
      They pour off the water that comes to the top.’ (B6:42)The cohesion may be one of total overlap, in that the clause is a reitera-
tion of what precedes. Although in such cases the clause is strictly not
sequential to the preceding narrative, it often acts as a link between what
precedes and a subsequent series of sequential clauses, e.g.  (6) ""u-dwíqt6lle ""ixála gu-‘ánte dìye,} jarrèta y-amrèxla.} jarréta dwìqt6lla}
      ""u-másta gu-bùrra-w} drí°6lle gu-‘ánte dìye.} ‘She packed food in his
      bag—we call it a jarreta (‘lunchbag’). She packed the lunchbag, (put)
      yoghurt in a pot and placed it in his bag.’ (A21:11)The construction is sometimes used in clauses that are logically cohesive
with what precedes in that they express the cause or the evidence for it,
e.g.  (7) ""áp-xa lì° láxxa gu-b7°a.} ""ayále díye hóle mšùdr6lla xa-dúk°a
      xéta.} ‘There is nobody here in the house. He has sent his children
      to another place.’ (A22:28)
                                    the clause                                    875  (8)   mère qa†lênnux.} mère q†ùl!} lìtli.} zúze làn-x6zya.} ‘He said “I’ll kill
        you.” He said “Kill (me). I have not got it. I have not found the
        money.” (A15:4)’The preposed object in such event-orientated constructions may be a
non-referential negative expression that has no anaphoric connection with
what precedes, e.g.  (9)  kùt-yum} ßaléwa gàw‰a} l-šùqa} msawòqe} ""u-‘ú-m6ndi l7 m5°èwa.}
       ‘Every day the man would go down to the market to do shopping,
       but would bring nothing back.’ (A22:1)
  (10) kúl-xa náša ßày6m.} ßày6m,} hí‘-m6ndi lá-""ax6l †¬à yománe.} ‘Every-
       body should fast. (Everybody) should fast and should not eat any-
       thing for three days.’ (B6:19)When the construction is topic-orientated, the initial object is set up as
a topic that is the main centre of concern in the clause. This strategy is
used at the beginning of a section of discourse, in which the referent of
the preposed object often retains its central topicality in what follows. The
fronted referent is often a newly introduced referent, e.g.  (11) xèlya mar6x°ìle} ""u-šoqíle p7ša d8raj ˙>rára díye taqríban ""àrbi.} d7ri
       marè°a bíya.} ‘They boil milk and let its heat become about forty
       degrees. They put rennet in it.’ (B6:37)
  (12) sá‰e xašlèxwala b-xašòlta.} ""u-mpart6nêxwala} ""u-qašrêxwala.} ‘We
       would crush barley in a mortar. We winnowed it and removed the
       peel.’ (B10:12)
  (13) xá-m6ndi t-amrànn5xu.} x†í°i b-quðalˆxu} bnóni qam-""7ni là qa†lí-
       tula.} bá°6r qa†lìtuli,} xéna ""ap-bnòni qa†lítula,} b-gòti qa†lítula.} ‘I say to
       you one thing. I implore you, do not kill my children before my
       eyes. After you kill me, then kill also my children, kill them by my
       side.’ (B9:13)
  (14) ""íðux lá-dar6t gu-nùra} t-là-""aqða.} ‘Do not put your hand in the fire,
       lest it burn’. (D2:8)In some cases the newly introduced referent is not explicity referred to
in the following clauses, but nevertheless it has some kind of relevance
in what follows. In (14), for example, the lamp is needed to see the girl
asleep. In (15) the living room is required to accommodate the guests on
their return. The object ""urxa ‘way’ in (16) is closely linked semantically
876                           chapter seventeenwith the following clause, which should be analysed as its complement
(‘the way she learnt’):  (15) xa-lámpa m7°6t b-""ìðux,} ""u-háyyo láxxa kêsli.} xzìg6n} ""áyya bráta šapìrt6
       t-íla dmíxta kêsli.} ‘Bring a lamp in your hand and come here to
       me. Look at this beautiful girl who has fallen asleep with me.’
       (A26:5–6)
  (16) mur-†la-Zìne} kú‘ke mtag6bràla,} ""áxni dì‰‰6n} la-mßél6n síql6n ßˆda.} ‘Tell
       Zine to prepare the living room. We have returned, we could not
       go out hunting.’ (A26:46)
  (17) dáx ""úrxa muxzélux ""èlla lípla ""àwwa šúla?} ‘How did you show her the
       way to learn this work?’ (A21:34)The initial object that is set up as the topic of the clause may be a generic
relative phrase, e.g.  (18) kú-m6ndi b8y6t šqùl.} ‘Take whatever you want.’ (A22:17)
  (19) kú-m6ndi-t ""amrènnux g8r6g ""òð6t.} ‘Everything I say you must do.’
       (A14:66)The construction is used in direct speech where the referent has topicality
due to its presence in the speech situation, e.g.  (20) ""áyya bràta} hox-mú°y6lla †làl6x} †la-brònux.} ‘We have brought this girl
       for you, for your son.’ (A21:6)
  (21) t-yánnux ""6ßrà dináre.} bàs} ""áwwa náša nablètle †amrêtle.} ‘I shall give you
       ten dinars. Only, take away this man and bury him.’ (A22:37)When two or more such topic-orientated constructions are juxtaposed,
they are presented as two parallel situations without being connected
sequentially, e.g.  (22) ""ap-šúl6t banjáne har-hàd6x ""awðíwale.} ""ap-šúl6t xiyáre hàd6x ""awðíwale.}
       ‘They carried out the cultivation of aubergines in the same way.

       (B7:13)
  (23) †¬á-bnone xilìli.} báxta xilàli.} ‘I have eaten three sons. I have eaten

       thing. It was laid out with food. A man came and took away my
       orchard. He does not return my orchard nor does he pay the price.’
       (A17:30)The topic-orientated construction with a fronted object may be juxtaposed
with a clause with an initial subject, which has the same effect of express-
ing parallel situations rather than sequentiality, e.g.  (25) mèšxa páy6š xòðe,} ""u-dáwwe d5r7la gu-xa-qußxáne gò‰ta.} ‘The butter
       remains by itself and they put the yoghurt water in a large pot.’
       (B6:40)The constructions discussed above should be distinguished from construc-
tions with a fronted object that is an information focus marked by the
nuclear stress, e.g.","[908, 909, 910, 911, 912, 913, 914, 915, 916]"
"The functional profile (i) may also be expressed by the basic copula.
Indeed, in (1) the independent basic copula is used in a parallel clause.
As we shall see, in this profile the predicate may also have the ""i-qa†6l
form of hwy. Clauses with the profiles (ii) and (iii), with habitual iterative
predicates, are usually expressed by the ""i-qa†6l form of hwy rather than
the copula. A parallel to (6) with y-áwe rather than háwe is, in fact, used
by the speaker later in the same text (†¬a°à yomá°a} ""u-†¬a°á l5l>wá°a y-áwe

parallel clause. All the occurrences of the qa†6l form of hwy cited above,
therefore, can be regarded as variants of the more usual ""i-qa†6l form. They
are unlikely to have arisen by the phonetic elision of the ""i- prefix, since
the ""i-qa†6l form is y-awe (< ""i-hawe), in which the prefix is followed by a
vowel and so is protected from elision. The qa†6l form here is more likely
to be an extension of the irrealis qa†6l (§15.3.9.1.2.). The crucial feature
                             the syntax of verbs                              643of the example above is that the predications lack specificity either due
to the subject being a generic class term or due to the predicate being
habitual. A predicate with this lack of specificity and distinctness is closer
semantically to an irrealis predicate than a more individuated one that
denotes a specific situation relating to a specific referent.
   The form occurs more frequently in verbs expressing habitual aspect
in subordinate temporal clauses. The subordinating particle D of the
temporal conjunction is usually prefixed to the verb, e.g.  (9)  lé-y-maßi m†áli b-5-dàn t-áwe yòma.} ‘They cannot play when it is
       daytime.’ (B11:2)
  (10) ""áyya †awálta m†alíwala rába b-sêtwa,} ""5-g6 t-áwe tàlga,} š-gar>wà°a.}
       ‘They played this game a lot in the winter, when there was snow,
       on top of the roofs.’ (B11:16)
  (11) ""áp-xa la-xazèla,} ""a-dán6 t-áwe †lìya yála.} ‘Nobody sees it, when the
       child is asleep.’ (B10:77)
  (12) ""u-""7g6t t-áwe xá m6nn7ni qúrb6 d-o-xèna,} har-maxênne} t>bálli l-t>bálle
       dìye,} ""aw-mìtle,} ""aw-prìqle,} ""aw-xsìrre.} ‘When one of us is near to
       the other, I strike my marble against his marble and he dies, he is
       finished, he has lost.’ (B11:27)
  (13) ""7-g6t háwi náše ràba} hálbat búš náša b-‰áy6š b-gáne dìye.} ‘When there are
       many people, of course a person feels himself more.’ (B15:15)15.3.9.1.2. Irrealis
The most usual function of the qa†6l form of hwy is to express irrealis,
which cannot be expressed by any of the copula forms or existential
particles. It occurs in the same irrealis contexts as the qa†6l form of other
verbs, which have been described in §15.1.1.5–10.
  The form may be used in a main clause, where it often expresses
deontic modality, e.g.  (1)   háw6t basíma ràba.} ‘May you be very well.’ (A5:7)
  (2)   háw6t hèšy6r ""ítl6n jênne.} ‘Be careful, we have jinn.’ (A22:26)
  (3)   ya-""àlaha,} háwe ßáxi hál-""5-g6t ""ána má†y6n ""èlle dìye.} ‘Oh God, let him
        be well until I reach him.’ (A26:80)
  (4)   hóya mxí°a l-mìla.} ‘Let it be (= let’s say it was) covered in blue.’
        (A4:29)This also applies to the expression la hoya ‘It should not be’, ‘It is not
allowed’, ‘It is not possible’, e.g.
644                             chapter fifteen  (5)   lá-hoya yóma qamáya xètna t-xazéla k yàlo.} ‘It is not allowed for the
        groom to see the bride on the first day.’ (A4:36)
  (6)   y6mmi la-hòya} ""àna} xà°i lá-""az6n xazènna.} ‘It is impossible for me not
        to go and find my sister.’ (A37:9)
  (7)   sab-lá-hoya biš-p°ì°a.} ‘It (the space between the beams) should not
        be wider.’ (B5:189)Questions in the qa†6l forms such as (8) and (9) are deontic expressions
whereby the speaker addresses the hearer expecting him to impose an
obligation (deontic necessity) or give permission (deontic possibility):  (8)   de-mà†o hóya?} ‘How can it be/should it be?’ (A30:21)
  (9)   mò-hoyali gwárta-w?} ‘What can marriage be to me?’ (A16:5)On some occasions the modality is epistemic, in that it expresses a less
than complete commitment to the truth of the proposition by the speaker.
Examples (10)–(11) fall into this category, in which the speakers express
disbelief that the situation could exist:  (10) ""ána háw6n Qára Tè≥din,} ma°yán6t xárje-w bárj6t bo†anàye,} t-á°e xa-""árxa
       ""ax-d-àwwa} gu-bˆ°i} ""u-pál6† l7ð6n lˆk5le zála,} l7ka là!} ‘(How could it
       be that) I am Qara Te≥din, the collector of all taxes of the people
       of Botan, and a guest comes like this into my house and leaves
       without me knowing where on earth he was going!’ (A26:34)
  (11) ""ána háw6n š¶x d-áyya hênna} ""u-náše lá-""a°a l-diwàni,} ""u-lá-hawa ""àrxi,}
       yátwi háwa rê˙qa.} ‘(How could it be that) I am the sheikh of this
       place and people do not come to my reception and do not become
       my guest, but sit far away.’ (A7:7)The form is used in the protasis of conditional sentences referring to
present or future time, e.g.  (12) ""6n-háwe t-têrte ""aqlá°a,} ""ána b-zawnênne.} ‘If it were two legged, I
       would buy it.’ (A22:5)
  (13) ""6n-hawéli bràta} t-yánna qa-bronˆxu.} ‘If I were to have a daughter, I
       would give her to your son.’ (A25:8)
  (14) ""6n-hóya rázi šènna díya p>làla,} pálga †la-d-áy ""u-pálga †la-d-àw,} maqimêxle.}
       ‘If she will be happy to share her years, half for her and half for
       him, we shall resurrect him.’ (A4:46)
                             the syntax of verbs                              645In (15) it takes the past time reference of the verb of the main clause as
its deictic centre:  (15) ""6n-háwe yále ràbe,} mère ""7ni máxe sar-amòða?} ‘If there were many chil-
       dren, he (the priest) said “Who will be the first to be baptized?” ’
       (B8:44)It is used in subordinate clauses that are complements of various verbs
and expressions denoting deontic obligation, when the action of the verb
in the subordinate clause is as yet unrealized, e.g.  (16) b8y6n t-áw6t láxxa b-sá""6t tmànya.} ‘I want you to be here at eight
       o’clock.’
  (17) hammáše míya g8r6g háwa ""èlle dìye.} ‘Water must be on it constantly.’
       (B5:78)
  (18) kút-duk°a ""áza ""àwra} ""áp ""ayya-xéta bàra láz6m háwya.} ‘Every place that
       she goes to and enters, the other has to be (i.e. to follow) after her.’
       (B12:2)Contrast (19) in which the expression laz6m expresses epistemic necessity,
in which the subordinate clause expresses what the speaker believes is a
real situation, rather than one that has not yet been realized:  (19) láz6m ""awwa-ràba ferèss5le.} ‘He must be a heroic warrior.’ (A29:43)In such cases the word laz6m is sometimes placed at the end of the clause,
e.g.  (20) ""u-xa-mašmóye-wewa ""6llˆni láz6m.} ‘Somebody must have been listen-
       ing to us.’ (A35:19)The form is used in clauses expressing purpose, e.g.  (21) ""ána b8y6n ""aláha t-yawèlli kùl-m6ndi bi-záwda,} ta-t-xayú°i hóya spày.} ‘I
       want God to give me more of everything, so that my life will be
       good.’ (A3:3)
  (22) ""í°wa ko‘5rnáy6t qurðàye} ""ánna ""i-ßáli dàšta} šaxínta háwi b-sêtwa.} ‘There
       were Kurdish nomads, who went down to the plain in order to be
       warm in Winter.’ (B18:1)
646                            chapter fifteen  (23) ""u-mkasˆwala-w} mattíwala xa-dúk°a šaxìnta} t-amrèxxa gòma.} t-óya
       šaxínta mkasˆwala.} ‘Then they would cover them and place them
       in a warm place, which we call a basement-stable. In order for it
       to be warm they would cover them.’ (B5:12)As can be seen in several of the examples cited above, qa†6l forms may
be used in clauses that have past form verbs in the surrounding context
and in such cases they have past time reference, with their deictic centre
in the tense of the adjacent verbs.","[681, 682, 683, 684, 685]"
"17.7.4.1. Preposed Subject Pronouns
When an independent subject is placed before the verb or copula, its
function depends on the prosody. If it does not bear the nuclear stress,
the motivation for the use of the pronoun is generally to mark some kind
of semantic discontinuity in the discourse. The discourse function of such
clauses, therefore, is similar to that of clauses with subject nominals in
initial position. The various types of semantic discontinuities include the
following.(i) Shift in Subject Referent
An independent subject pronoun is used when there is a change in sub-
ject, e.g.
866                           chapter seventeen  (1)   ""árya °éle †álbe dìye,} ""áwwa q†ìlle †la-""árya.} ‘A lion once attacked him.
        He killed the lion.’ (A11:1)
  (2)   téla rìqle,} ""áy hédi-hedi qìmla.} ‘The fox ran. She (the bear) slowly got
        up.’ (A20:5)
  (3)   zìlela} ""ay-qímt5la wíðt5la kùbbe-w} ""u-qlí°6lla gu-mêšxa.} ‘They went off
        and she made meat-balls and fried them in oil.’ (A21:30)
  (4)   ""u-mutt7°5la †¬á°i lêxme} gu-‘ànta.} mèra bábi náb6lla gu-jàma} hàlle!} ""áwwa
        zíl5le b-""ùrxa.} ‘She put thirty loaves of bread in a basket. She said
        “Father, take them to the mosque and give them to him.” He went
        off on the road.’ (A17:11–12)
  (5)   maymúne kúlla dmìxela.} ""u-xa-béna ""áni qìmela,} gníw6lla gàna,} wíre
        gu-d-a-wádi-t š6kwàne.} ‘All the monkeys slept. Then they (the men)
        got up and stole away and went into the valley of the ants.’
        (A14:56)
  (6)   b8y6t ""àxl6t,} xùl.} kpìn6t.} míya štì.} ""ána la-q7°6n b-‘ù m6ndí.} ‘If you
        want to eat, eat! You are hungry. Drink some water. I shall not
        touch anything.’ (A14:59)
  (7)   ""u-M8mo mítle qèdamta-w} ""ána m7°6n ""aßêrta.} ‘M>mo died in the
        morning and I shall die in the evening.’ (A26:83)An independent pronoun is often used at the beginning of a turn in
conversation, e.g.  (8)  mère ""ána t-á°6n mênn6x.} ‘He said “I shall come with you.” ’
       (A24:39)
  (9) mère ""ána b8y6n S6ttìye.} ‘He said “I love S6ttiye.” ’ (A25:20)
  (10) mère ""áti y8ð6t ""ˆk5le?} ‘He said “Do you know where he is?” ’
       (A25:74)
  (11) mère ""áxtu ""asqítu ""êdyo.} ‘He said “You go up today.” ’ (A25:85)
  (12) mère ""ay-mòdila?} ‘He said “What is that?” ’ (A21:8)
  (13) mère ""áxni t-àz6x. lá xazèxle bròn6n.} ‘He said “We should go. We shall
       not see our son.” ’ (A25:11)(ii) Non-Sequential Actions
On some occasions where an independent subject pronoun is used, there
is no change in the subject referent. In such cases the use of the pro-
noun reflects a discontinuity on another level of the discourse. One such
discontinuity is the lack of temporal sequence between the action of the
                                     the clause                                     867clause and that of the adjacent discourse. The action of the clause may
overlap temporally with it, e.g.  (1) zílt5la bár t-ile-b7°a prìqa,} ""áza xázya jùlla,} júlla lì°.} ""áyya šaqlàwale ríx6t
      júlle.} ‘After the house was finished, she went to find her clothes, but
      her clothes were not there. She could smell the scent of the clothes.’
      (A14:99–100)
  (2) ""ána bí°6nnux °í°6n bà°rux.} w-ana-l7ð6n t-awètwa ""áti xày6n pal†ètwa mènni.}
      ‘I loved you and followed you, but I did not know that you would
      turn out to be treacherous to me.’ (A14:101)Two clauses with different initial pronouns that are juxtaposed often express
an opposition between two temporally overlapping events, e.g.  (3) ""áti ""àxl6t.} ""áxni t-àzexi.} lá p5š6x †la-x>dàya.} ‘You eat. We shall go. We
      shall not stay for lunch.’ (A21:30)
  (4) qím5le Qára Tè≥din} ""aw-ßèly5le mðìta.} ""ay-qìmt5la,} wíðta qàwa.} ‘Qara
      Te≥din set off. He went down to the town. She got up and made
      coffee.’ (A26:31)In (5) and (6) the independent pronoun is used in a clause that disrupts
the temporal sequence by moving back on the time line to reiterate an
event that occurred earlier:  (5) xá m6n-xúwwe gò‰e} zíl5le šqíla senìye} mù°y6lla.} síqa sìqa} mútt6lla k6s-d-ó
      K>rim-addìn.} ""áwwa zíla híw6lla tíwa tàma.} ‘One of the large snakes
      went and took the tray and brought it. He came up and put it next
      to Karimaddin. He went and delivered it and sat down again.’
      (A14:31)
  (6) ""áwwa mère b-àlaha} har-xá-m6ndi ""ì° b-áyya dúk°a t-íle wìra.} ""áw xzèle
      ""o-dídwa ""7ka wìrre.} ‘He said (to himself ) “By God, there must be
      something in this place where it entered.” He saw where the fly
      had entered.’ (A11:9)(iii) Other Discourse Shifts
The discontinuity can sometimes be identified with the onset of a new
section of discourse. This is seen in the following extracts from narrative,
in which the construction signals the onset of an event that is distinct
from what is recounted in the preceding clauses. In (1) the construction
868                          chapter seventeenmarks the spatio-temporal shift in the event line in which the protagonists
enters a different world. In (2) the clause marks a spatio-temporal boundary
between the event of the woman’s disposing of the king and the event of
her returning to her room. In (3) the construction distinguishes between
the event of the protagonist’s laying the trap and the event of his setting
himself in a hiding place.  (1) ""u-xzéle ""ína t9ra} b-qˆsa} xa-kilòn} sèma-w} qðíla séma b-rèše}. l7le dàwa.}
      p°ìx6lle.} ""áwwa plí†5le gu-ða-dúnye xèta,} š6mša milànta,} ""8ra milànta.}
      ‘He saw that the door was of wood and had a lock of silver with
      a silver key on it. It was not gold. He opened it. He came out into
      another world, with a blue sun and a blue land.’ (A14:26)

      ‘The king became drunk. He became drunk and she grasped him
      by his legs, dragged him along and took him to the bathroom, then
      closed the door behind him. She came back and went to sleep in
      her room. She closed the door and went to sleep.’ (A17:26)
  (3) ""áwwa-≥i zàl5le,} nabòl6lla} xámra mènna dìya,} l-d-à-duk°a.} xzày6lla ""7na.}
      mdabòq6lla} mattóye qìra,} †a†íya-w qìra.} míya ktàp5la.} dráy5le biš-hód6x

      with wine to that place. He saw the spring. He pressed it down,
      put down tar, the woolen mat and tar. The water stopped flowing.
      He put some wine further up from them. He positioned himself.
      He dug a place to hide. He hid.’ (A12:49)In some cases the main motivation to use an independent pronoun is to
express the independence of the clause for the sake of giving it promi-
nence. This appears to apply to the folowing:  (4) làn-gwirta.} ""ána spár6n ""êllux.} ""ána lˆ-gor6n.} ‘I have not married. I am
      waiting for you. I shall not marry.’ (A25:83)
  (5) málka t-áw6t basìma} ""áti díya píšlux málka dìy6n.} ‘King, may you be
      well, you have now become our king.’ (A14:45)Occasionally a 2nd person independent pronoun is used with an impera-
tive form. The motivation for this is likewise to mark off the construction
clearly from what precedes in order to enhance its prominence. In (6) the
speaker also uses the particle of immediacy d6- to increase the force of
the imperative:
                                      the clause                                 869  (6) d6-""áti xùš!} ‘You go!’ (A39:1)When the independent pronoun bears the nuclear stress, the function of
the construction is generally different. The motivation for the use of the
pronoun in such cases is normally to express an information focus on the
pronominal referent, the remainder of the clause being presuppositional.
The construction may be used to express contrastive assertion, e.g.  (7)     ""áti là pálx6t.} ""áti tù.} ""àna pálx6n.} ‘Don’t you work. You sit down. I
          shall work.’ (A21:23)
  (8)     ""àti parmètle réši.} ‘You will cut off my head.’ (A14:35)In some cases there is no clear contrastive opposition, e.g.  (9)     xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa} ""u-t-yáxla ""èlle dìye.} ""àw mtagbèrra.}
          ‘Let’s look for a man who is a hard worker and give her to him.
          He will look after her’. (A21:3)In clauses containing a copula, the copula is placed on the focused pro-
noun, e.g.  (10) ""áwwa lˆle kálba,} ""àtit kálba.} ‘He is not a dog. You are a dog’
       (A11:20)
  (11) ""àn6n xèzy6lle,} dìyile.} ‘I (and nobody else) have found it. It is mine.’
       (A14:15)In (12) a nuclear stress occurs also on the predicate of the clause, which
can be regarded as being the result of the bonding together of two into-
nation groups by sandhi:1  (12) ""àtit °í°a kêsli.} lán ""àna-""6°ya kêsl6x.} ‘You came to me. I did not come
       to you.’ (A4:4)The information focus may be exclusive or inclusive. The intonation
group in such cases may contain two nuclei, which can be interpreted as
intonation group sandhi, e.g.","[904, 905, 906, 907, 908]"
"1.3.2. Devoicing of Word Final Consonants
In some cases a word final voiced consonant is devoiced. This is the case
with the genitive/relative particle D, which is devoiced when cliticized to
the end of a word, e.g. ""ánna waríð6t qðàle (< wariðe d-qðale) ‘these veins of
his neck’ (A26:81), ßáw°a gu-púmm6t màr5le š6klánta} (< pumma d-mar5le) ‘A
word is beautiful in the mouth of its owner’ (A26:40).
   Kurdish loanwords that have final voiced /z/ in the source language
often have voiceless /s/ in the Aramaic dialect, e.g.     dùs ‘right, true’                  Kurd. dûz
     marr6s ‘hair of angora goat’       Kurd. merezThe final consonant remains unvoiced when clitics are added, e.g. dùs-iw6t
‘you are right’. When, however, morphological affixes are attached and
the consonant is no longer word final, the original voicing is maintained,
e.g. duzu°a ‘truth’.

The reflex of the fricative allophone of *b in earlier Aramaic is the semi-
vowel /w/. This is found after both vowels and consonants, e.g.     genawa             ‘thief ’                 < *gannà∫à
     sawa               ‘grandfather’            < *sà∫à

     xawra              ‘friend’                 < *˙a∫rà
     šawqa              ‘she leaves’             < *šà∫qàWhen *∫ was preceded by *u, the sequence *u∫ contracted to /u/, e.g.     gure               ‘men’                    < *gu∫rè
     tuna               ‘straw’                  < *tu∫nà
     duša               ‘honey’                  < *du∫šà
     ruta               ‘Friday’                 < *'aru∫tàOn some occasions the sequence /aw/ that derives from *a∫ or *à∫ con-
tracts to /o/ before a consonant, e.g.     gota               ‘side’                   < *ga∫tàIn a number of words of native Aramaic stock, the stop /b/ occurs after
a vowel. These may be classified as follows:(i) Cases where the /b/ was originally geminated, e.g.
     xabuša             ‘apple’                < *˙abbùšà
     dabaša             ‘bee’                  < *dabbàšà
     šab°a              ‘week’                 < *šabb6∆à
     mzab6n             ‘he sells’             < *mzabben
                                 consonants                                 41In the word ßabota ‘finger’ the stop /b/ may have arisen by secondary gemi-
nation of an original *b in order to prevent the elision of the preceding
vowel after the insertion of an epenthetic vowel after it: ßabota < *ßabb6""tà
< *ßab'6∆à. Compare J. Amedia ßabo""ta, Qaraqosh ßub6""°a. The gemination
has been preserved in some dialects, e.g. D5re ß6bbota.(ii) When the preceding vowel is an epenthetic, e.g.
      kal6b°a          ‘bitch’                  cf. kalba ‘dog’(iii) Where a word beginning with /b/ has been bonded with a preceding
element that ends in vowel, e.g.
      xo-b5°a                          ‘under the house’
      gu-b5°a                          ‘in the house’We can include here verbal roots that have /b/ as their first radical. The
stop remains through all inflections, including when prefixes that end in
a vowel are attached to it, e.g. brq ‘to shine’, bar6q ‘it shines’, mabr6q ‘it
causes to shine’; bny ‘to build’, bane ‘he builds’, mabne ‘he causes to build’.
This invariability is also exhibited by most noun forms, e.g. kalba ‘dog’,
kal6b°a ‘bitch’. The plural form of this word constitutes an exception to
this principle: kalba ‘dog’ vs. kalwe (< *kal∫è) ‘dogs’.(iv) Where the /b/ was originally preceded by a vowelless consonant,
which has now been elided, e.g.
     sebu°a           ‘old age’              < *sa""bu°a
     mšaboðe          ‘to enslave’           < *mša'boðe(v) Forms arising by analogy with words that have preserved /b/ for one
of the reasons listed above. Examples of this include dab6š ‘it sticks’, which
is a stem I verb and so the middle radical would not have been geminated
historically, and z6bla ‘manure’ (cf. Syr. ze∫là). In both cases the source of
the analogy appears to have been stem II verb forms (historical pa''el), in
which the middle /b/ was originally geminated, viz. mdab6š ‘he makes stick’
(originally ‘he makes like honey’) and mzab6l ‘he lays manure’. Elsewhere a
stop /b/ occurring as the middle radical of a stem II verb is not extended
by analogy to stem I forms that belong historically to the same root. This
is found mainly where there is considerable semantic distinction between
the two stem forms, e.g.
42                                       chapter one       zwana ‘to buy’              mzabone ‘to sell’
       gwaya ‘to beg’              mgaboye ‘to elect’
       qwaya ‘to scoop’            mqaboye ‘to swell’Likewise, the stop of stem II is not elsewhere extended by analogy to
nominal forms as in the case of mzabole: z6bla; cf. mšaboxe ‘to glorify’ vs.
šuxa ‘praise’.(vi) In some cases the stop /b/ rather than the expected /w/ occurs as
the second radical of a stem I verbal root apparently in order to avoid
homophony between two roots, e.g.
      †bele ‘he sank’ (< *†b' )    †wele ‘it roasted’ (< *†wy)
      gbaya ‘to froth’ (< *gbb) 2
                                   gwaya ‘to beg’ (< *gby)A historical *b is sometimes devoiced to /p/ when it has been adjacent
to a laryngal *"", which often, but not always, derives historically from
pharyngal *', e.g.       ""arpa                       < *""arb""à < *""arb'à                ‘four’
       ß6ppa                       < *ß6b""à < *ß6b'à                  ‘finger’
       p-aqle                      < *b-""aqlè < *b-'aqlè              ‘by foot’
       p-ape                       < *b-""appè                         ‘beyond’The first two of these examples have alternative forms without devoicing,
viz. ""arba ‘four’ and ßabota ‘finger’. It is possible that the forms with devoicing
have entered the speech of some informants under the influence of the
Christian dialect of Urmi, in which this process of devoicing is regular.
   As remarked in §1.3.2., devoicing has sometimes been conditioned by an
adjacent unvoiced consonant, e.g. gupta ‘cheese’ (cf. Syr. g∫ettà < *g∫entà).1.4.1.2. *p
The reflex of *p is, as a general rule, the stop /p/, including in post-
vocalic positions, e.g.       kepa                        ‘stone’                 < *kèªà
       ""upra                       ‘soil’                  < *'aªrà

‘shoulder, arm’ (< *ruªšà cf. Syr. raªšà ‘shoulder blade’) in which a post-
vocalic *ª behaves like a post-vocalic *∫. Note also †ußa ‘example’, which
has an original stop *p deriving ultimately from Greek pi (< *†upsà <
Greek τύπος). A further case may be swana ‘projecting edge of a roof ’,
which appears to be cognate with ˇuyoro ßfarno of the same meaning,
both being derived from Syr. sªàrà ‘edge’ (cf. Tezel 2003: 238).
   The stop /p/ often appears in Arabic and Kurdish loanwords where
the source language has the fricative /f/, reflecting a process analogous
to that of hardening the fricative *ª in Aramaic words, e.g.     šapra                ‘large knife’             < Arab. šafra
     mtalope              ‘to ruin’                 < Arab. tallafa

     q6ppo                ‘foam’                    < Kurd. kefSome loans exist in two variant forms, one with the original /f/ and one
with /p/, e.g.     feka ~ peka          ‘fruit’                   < Arab. fàkiha1.4.1.3. *t
The original interdental fricative allophone of this consonant has been
preserved as an independent phoneme and is represented in the transcrip-
tion by the symbol /°/. The phonemic contrast between /°/ and /t/ is
demonstrated by minimal pairs such as:     °ela            ‘she came’             tela            ‘fox’
     ma°a            ‘village’              mata            ‘grape’
     mar°a           ‘mistress’             marta           ‘saying’The fricative /°/ occurs in all positions, after both vowels and consonants,
and also at the beginning of a word, e.g.     ""a°‰a           ‘land’
     xa°a            ‘sister’
44                               chapter one     xma°a            ‘mother-in-law’
     k°awa            ‘book’
     šab°a            ‘week’
     qar°a            ‘cold’
     °ele             ‘he came’When /°/ occurs as a radical consonant in a root, it is used throughout
all inflections of the root, irrespective of the phonetic environment, e.g.
r°x ‘to boil’: ra°6x ‘it boils’, mar°6x ‘he causes to boil’; k°w ‘to write’: ka°wa
‘she writes’, k°awa ‘book’, ka°awa ‘writer’.
   In a few isolated cases the articulation of the fricative /°/ is weakened
after a vowel and is elided. This applies to the numeral †¬a ‘three’, which
is a variant of the form †¬a°a. It also sporadically occurs in the inflections
of the verb m-°y ‘to bring’, e.g. may7wa ‘They used to bring’ (< m5°7wa,
B5:157), m5y•nna ‘I shall bring her’ (< m5°•nna A4:9).
   On some occasions the stop /t/ is found after vowels in words of native
Aramaic stock. The occurrences may be classified as follows:(i) Cases where the /t/ was originally geminated, e.g.
     brata              ‘daughter’              < *brattà
     mðita              ‘town’                  < *mðìttà < *mðìntà
     šeta               ‘year’                  < *šattà < *šantà(ii) Where the /t/ was originally separated from the preceding vowel by
a pharyngal or a laryngal, which have now been elided, e.g.
      qa†ota            ‘break in channel’      < *qa†o""ta < *qà†ò'tà
      garruta           ‘pile of leaves’        < *garru""ta < *garru'tà
      beta              ‘egg’                   < *be""ta < *bè'tà
      šmita             ‘heard (fs.)’           < *šmi""ta < *šmì'tà
      tata              ‘crest’ (of bird)       < *ta""ta < *ta8tà
      nita              ‘(party until) dawn’    < *n8ìhtà(iii) Where the stop /t/ was originally preceded by the consonant *∫,
which has subsequently become contracted
      gota              ‘side’                 < *ga∫tà
      šwota             ‘neighbour (f.)’       < *š∫à∫tà
      ruta              ‘Friday’               < *'aru∫tàThe sequences *a∫ and *à∫ more frequently develop into the diphthong
/aw/ than contract completely to /o/. The stop /t/ occurs after /aw/
                                 consonants                                 45diphthongs with this background, in contrast to /aw/ diphthongs contain-
ing an original /w/, which are followed by the fricative /°/:     sawta                ‘old woman’               < *sà∫tà
     xlawta               ‘milking’                 < *˙là∫tà

     ßaw°a                ‘voice, sound’            < *ßaw°à(iv) The fricative /°/ shifts to the stop /t/ when it is in contact with a
following /l/ or /n/. This is abundantly attested in verbs with a final /°/
radical when they have a pronominal suffix beginning with /l/ (L-suffix)
attached to them, e.g.
     mitle               ‘he died’                < my°
     qitle               ‘he hit’                 < qy°
     ditle               ‘he sweated’             < dy°
     tpitle              ‘he sneezed’             < tp°
     mußy6tle            ‘he listened’            < m-ßy° III
     mxu°x6tle           ‘he renewed’             < m-x°x°It takes place when an L-suffix is added to the existential particle ""i° ‘there
is’, e.g. ""itle ‘he has’ (< ""i° + le).
    It also occurs when /°/ comes into contact with /l/ within a root,
e.g.     patli                ‘they turn’               < p°lExamples of the shift of the fricative /°/ before /n/ include:     x6tna                ‘groom’                   < *x6°na
     ""ašitnaya            ‘man from Ashitha’        < ""Aši°aThis shift of alveolar fricatives before /l/ and /n/ occurs regularly.(v) Various cases of the stop /t/ after a vowel that cannot easily be
explained by the historical phonology of the word have apparently arisen
by analogy with cases of the stop that can be explained historically.
   A few verbal roots contain the stop /t/ throughout all inflections, even
when occurring after vowels, e.g. šty ‘to drink’, ""tw ‘to sit’. The explanation
for the existence of the stop /t/ in these seems to be that at an earlier
46                              chapter onehistorical period the stop allophone was used in some of their inflections
where there was no preceding vowel and that this was then generalized by
analogy to all inflections. In the case of šty, the initial sequence of sibilant
+ stop in certain inflections of the verb, such as the imperative or forms
derived from the past base, is pronounced with ease as a cluster, without
an intervening epenthetic, e.g. šti ‘drink!’, šteli ‘I drank’. This is reflected
by the prosthetic vowel that is indicated in the orthography of some forms
of earlier Aramaic, e.g. Syr. ""eštì. After the distinction between /t/ and /°/
had become phonemicized, the stop would have been generalized to all
inflectional forms, including those where it was preceded by a vowel, e.g.
šate ‘he drinks’. The stop in ""tw ‘to sit’ may have been generalized from
inflections of this verb that have initial /t/, e.g. tiwle ‘he sat down’, tiwa
‘sitting’. Mention should also be made of the noun s6twa ‘winter’, where
the stop /t/ occurs after a vowel. It is likely that here also the explanation
is the initial sequence of s and t. These would have formed a cluster in
the absolute form *staw at some earlier historical period.
    The feminine singular resultative participle of the verb hwy ‘to be’ is
wita with the stop /t/, whereas other final /y/ verbs have /°/ in the cor-
responding form, e.g. xzi°a (xzy ‘to see’). The stop seems to have arisen
by analogy with final /""/ verbs, where the stop is historically explicable
by the original presence of a preceding pharyngal. This is due to the
resemblance between the masculine singular resultative participles:                      Resultative participle ms.     Resultative participle fs.
     šm"" ‘to hear’              šmiya                          šmita
     hwy ‘to be’                 wiya                           witaIn the inflection of verbs and the existential partial ""i° a stop /t/ resulting
from contact with /l/ is sometimes extended by analogy to inflections
where they are not in direct contact with /l/, e.g.     patli      ‘they turn’      pat6l ~ pa°6l           ‘he turns’ ( p°l )
     mitle      ‘he died’        mitwale ~ mi°wale       ‘he had died’ (my°)
     ""itle      ‘he has’         ""itwale ~ ""i°wale       ‘he used to have’1.4.1.4. *d
The original interdental fricative allophone of this consonant has been
preserved as an independent phoneme and is represented in the tran-
scription by the symbol /ð/. The phonemic distinction of /ð/ from /d/
is demonstrated by minimal pairs such as:
                                 consonants                                  47     guða ‘churn’                  guda ‘wall’The consonant /ð/ occurs after both vowels and consonants, and also at
the beginning of a word, e.g.     ""iða                          ‘hand’
     huðaya                        ‘Jew’
     qðala                         ‘neck’
     mðita                         ‘town’
     rawðana                       ‘earthquake’
     ðile                          ‘he knew’When /ð/ occurs as a radical in a root, it is used in all inflections of the
root, irrespective of the phonetic environment, e.g. rqð ‘to dance’: raq6ð
‘he dances’, raqði ‘they dance’, r6qða ‘a dance’; šðy ‘to card (wool)’: šaðe ‘he
cards’, šðele ‘he carded’, šaðaya ‘carder’.
   A diphthong /aw/ in which the /w/ is the reflex of an original *∫ is
followed either by the stop /d/ or the fricative /ð/, e.g.     kawda                ‘liver’                    < *ka∫dà
     ""awða                ‘she does’                 < *'à∫≈àThe fricative /ð/ in ""awða occurs since it has been generalized throughout
the root from contexts where it occurs after a vowel, e.g. ""aw6ð ‘he does’.
  On some occasions the stop /d/ is found after vowels in words of native
Aramaic stock. The occurrences may be classified as follows:(i) Words that originally contained geminated /d/, e.g.
     guda                ‘wall’                < *guddà
     šlada               ‘corpse’              < *šladdà
     b6dra               ‘threshing-floor’     < *be + ""6dd6rà
     mšad6r              ‘he sends’            < *mšadd6rIn some cases the gemination was a secondary development consequent
upon a resyllabification. This explains, for example, the /d/ in the form
xad•ss6r ‘eleven’, which appears to have been secondarily geminated in order
to allow an /a/ vowel to follow the initial letter, presumably by force of
analogy with the form for one, xa: xad•sser < *xadd•""s6r < *˙6≈a'sar.
48                               chapter one(ii) The stop /d/ occurs after a vowel when it is in contact with a follow-
ing /l/ or /n/, e.g.
      ridle             ‘he darned’               < ryð
      qidle             ‘he burnt’                < ""qð
      gridle            ‘he scrubbed’             < grð
      mpuq6dle          ‘he commanded’            < m-pqð II
      gadl6x            ‘we plait’                < gðl
      g6dla             ‘plaited fence’           < gðl
      yadli             ‘they lay (eggs)’         < yðl
      mug6dla           ‘frozen’                  < m-gðl III
      kaw6dna           ‘ass’                     cf. kawð6nta ‘she ass’This shift of alveolar fricatives before /l/ and /n/ occurs regularly, with
only very few exceptions (e.g. mù wiðl7xu? ‘What have you done’ B5:2). In
a number of verbs a final stop /d/, which originally arose by this phonetic
process by contact with the /l/ of L-suffixes, has become generalized to
all inflected forms of the root, e.g. xzada ‘to plough’, rgada ‘to tremble’,
mxazode ‘to blame, reproach’, mašxode ‘to congratulate’.(iii) The fricative /ð/ occasionally shifts to the stop /d/ by a dissimila-
tory process when the fricative /°/ occurs at the beginning of the next
syllable, e.g.
      xadu°a ~ xaðu°a    ‘joy’                     < xðy ‘to be joyous’
      mamodi°a           ‘baptism’                 < m-mð ‘to baptize’(iv) The stop /d/ after the vowel in the word didwa ‘fly’ appears to have
developed by a form of syllabic assimilation. The syllabification of the
word is evidently di-dwa and the onset of the second syllable has been
assimilated to the initial stop /d/ of the first. Similar developments are
found in other NENA dialects, e.g. C. Qaraqosh deda ‘breast’ (cf. Syr.
t6≈à), didi ‘mine’ < *dili.(v) The stop /d/ occurs as the second radical in the verbal roots zdy ‘to
throw’ and zd"" ‘to fear’, where it does not seem to be derived historically
from a geminate /d/. In the case of zdy, which is cognate with Syr. š≈à,
the /d/ is likely to have originated in an initial cluster zd- in certain inflec-
tions and was extended to all inflections by analogy. The verb zd"" appears
to be derived historically from *""izdawwa', the ""e∆pa''al form of the root zw'
in earlier Aramaic (cf. Nöldeke 1868: 195).

inflections, including cases where the first radical is preceded by the
vowel of a prefix, e.g. dmx ‘to sleep’: dam6x ‘he sleeps’, madm6x ‘he puts
to sleep’.(vii) When the vowel preceding /d/ is prosthetic, it remains a stop. In
some cases a prosthetic vowel has become a fixed feature of the word,
as in the forms ""•dyo (< *dà-yòm) ‘today’ and ""•dl5le (< *dà-laylyà) ‘tonight’
where it bears the stress.(viii) A /d/ at the beginning of a word is not affected by a vowel at the
end of a preceding word. This includes the subordinating particle D, e.g.
xóna d-o-málka ‘the brother of that king’ (A25:1), málka d-áyya bà≥6r ‘the
king of this town’ (A32:5), réša-reša d-o-gàre ‘onto that roof ’ (A23:14). This
particle may be cliticized to the preceding word, but it still remains a stop
and is generally devoiced, e.g. báb6t bráta ‘the father of the girl’ (A29:43),
t8r6t gêppa ‘entrance of the cave’ (A31:7), š•kl6t b6‰-náša ‘the form of a
human’ (A8:31), ""u-garšíle b-ó-q5s6t y-áwe bi-dìye| ‘and they pull it with the
(handle of) wood that is attached to it’ (B5:194).
   The occurrence of the stop /d/ in words such as hadiya ‘now’ and hod6x
‘beyond’ may have a similar explanation, in that these can be analysed
historically as composite units, the first syllable of which is a presentative
element, i.e. ha-diya, ho-d6x. The form diya ‘now’, without the initial ha- is,
in fact, also used in the dialect. We can include here also the form hatxa
‘thus’, in which the /d/ has become devoiced due to contact with the
following unvoiced /x/ (cf. the related word had6x).1.4.1.5. *k
The fricative allophone of *k has been preserved in many cases, e.g.     ""ax6l                ‘he eats’                 < *""à§el
     baxe                 ‘he weeps’                < *bà§è
     naxraya              ‘stranger’                < *na§ràyà
     buraxa               ‘blessing’                < *burrà§à
     kuraxa               ‘shroud’                  < *kurrà§àThe fricative /x/ occurs also where a diphthong has contracted to a
vowel, e.g.     k6xwa                ‘star’                    < *kawk6∫à
50                              chapter oneThe stop /k/ sometimes occurs after a vowel in words of Aramaic stock.
These cases may be classified as follows:(i) Where the consonant was originally geminated, e.g.
     kaka             ‘tooth’                 < *kakkà
     ""akara           ‘farmer’                < *""akkàrà
     rakixa           ‘soft’                  < *rakkì§à
     s6k°a            ‘ploughshare’           < *sekk6°à
     duk°a            ‘place’                 < *dukk6°à(ii) When the preceding vowel is an epenthetic, e.g.
      mal6k°a          ‘queen’                  cf. malka ‘king’(iii) When the preceding vowel belongs to an originally separate particle
that has become bonded onto a word beginning with /k/, e.g.
      xakma             ‘some’                 < *xa + kmaThe word ""5ka ‘where’ may possibly fall into this category (< *""ay-kà).
Compare the variant form k5le? ‘where is he’ (§8.20.4.).(iv) In various verbal roots, e.g.
      raku               ‘he rides’                < *rà§e∫
      rak6x              ‘it softens’              < *rà§e§
      lak6x              ‘he licks’                < *là§e˙
      gax6k              ‘he laughs’               < *gà˙e§
      xak6k              ‘he laughs’               < *gà˙e§The /k/ has been generalized throughout all inflections of these verbal
roots. The /k/ in the first two roots may have arisen by analogy. In the
root rkw ‘to ride’ the stop may have arisen by analogy with the form
rakawa ‘rider’, in which the /k/ is a reflex of an originally geminated
consonant (< *rakkà∫à). The /k/ in the root rkx ‘to soften’ is likely to be
based on the analogy of the adjective rakixa, in which the medial /k/ was
originally geminated (< *rakkì§à). Another possibility is that the stop arose
originally in inflections of the root where the /k/ clustered with the initial
/r/ without an intervening vowel, e.g. in the past form rkule ‘he rode’. It
is worth noting that such consonantal clustering took place in Syriac in
words with initial /r/, as is reflected by the writing of prosthetic alaph in
the orthography in words such as             ‫=ܐ‬           ‘beloved ones’ and
    ‫= ܐܪܕ‬      ‫‘ ܪܕ‬upper garment’ (Nöldeke 1904: 37). The stop /k/ in the
                                consonants                                 51other roots appear to have arisen by a dissimilation process preventing the
sequence of two velar fricatives. In xkk, a variant of gxk, there has been
metathesis and subsequent devoicing of the initial /g/.1.4.1.6. *g
The velar fricative allophone of *g has in most cases been weakened to
zero when in contact with another consonant, e.g.     n>ra    ‘axe’                      < *nar8a (cf. Syr. nàr©à)
     z>ra    ‘yellow’                   < *zar8a (cf. Syr. zàr8à)
     lena    ‘furrow’                   < *l8ena (cf. Syr. l8ettà)
     lina    ‘jar’                      < *l8ina (cf. Syr. l8ìnà)
     nita    ‘party until dawn’         < *n8ìhtà
     pela    ‘radish’                   < *pa8là (cf. Syr. puglà)
     lam6kka ‘jaw of an animal’         < *la8ma + 6kka (cf. Syr. lu8mà)When it occurred between vowels, it is generally replaced by the glide /y/
or, when the following vowel is rounded, by the glide /w/, e.g.     ‰ay6š               ‘he wakes up’             < *rà8eš
     šay6r               ‘he stokes’               < *šà8er
     rawola              ‘valley’                  < *rà8òlàWhen it occurred between two /a/ vowels, its reflex is either the laryngal
/""/ or the glide /y/, e.g.     sya""a ~ syaya       ‘fence’                   < *syà8à
     pla""a ~ playa       ‘to divide’               < *plà8à
     šra""a ~ šraya       ‘oil-lamp’                < *šrà8àThe laryngal /""/ is occasionally found between other vowels, e.g.     ya""isa          ‘wife’s sister’s husband’         < ""a8ìsàAs shown by Tsereteli (1990), the passage of the velar fricative *8 to /""/ or
zero underwent an intermediate stage in which *8 shifted to the pharyngal
fricative *'. A vestige of this pharyngal can be identified in the emphatic
/‰/ of ‰ay6š ‘he wakes’ (< *‰a""6š < *ra'eš < *rà8eš). Some NENA dialects
preserve an emphatic articulation also in other words, e.g. C. Urmi +lina
[˚lÂ[nâ] ‘jar’. The pharyngal consonant is preserved in a number of words
52                              chapter onein a few NENA dialects, e.g. J. Amedia ‰a'ola ‘valley’, ja'oda ‘hatchet (cf.
C. Barwar rawola, jaw6tta).
   The velar fricative realization is preserved in a few isolated words. There
is a tendency to devoice this to /x/, though the original voiced realization
/©/ is preserved in some words:     paxra             ‘body’               < *pa8rà
     sxaða ~ s©aða     ‘to worship’         < *s8à≈a
     šxaša ~ š©aša     ‘to be disturbed’    < *š8àšà
     l6xxawa           ‘bit, bridle’        cf. Syr. l8àmà, J. Amedia la©maA similar devoicing of an original voiced velar fricative /©/ to /x/ takes
place in loanwords from Arabic, many of which may have entered the
language through Kurdish, where this devoicing also occurs, e.g.     xam                 ‘worry’                   < Arab. ©amm
     x>daya              ‘lunch’                   < Arab. ©adà""
     xulama              ‘servant’                 < Arab. ©ulàm
     x6l†a               ‘mistake’                 < Arab. ©ala†
     xer6tta             ‘zeal’                    < Arab. ©èra
     xlaqa               ‘to lock’                 < Arab. ©lqThe stop /g/ is retained after a vowel in the following circumstances:(i) When the consonant was originally geminated, e.g.
     zaga             ‘bell’                  < *zaggà
     nagara           ‘carpenter’             < *naggàrà
     daglana          ‘liar’                  < *dagg6lànà
     magla            ‘scythe’                < *magg6là
     prage            ‘millet’                < *praggè(ii) When the preceding vowel is an epenthetic, e.g.
      xur6g°a          ‘stepdaughter’ (cf. xurga ‘stepson’)(iii) When the /g/ originally stood at the beginning of a word that has
become bonded with a preceding word that ends in a vowel, e.g.
      be-gwina   ‘eyebrow’        < *be-g∫ìnà (‘place of the eyebrows’)The stop /g/ occurs after the diphthong /aw/, e.g. zawga ‘pair’. In
many NENA dialects where this diphthong contracts to /o/ the reflex of
                                  consonants                               53the original *g in this word is that of a fricative rather than a stop, e.g.
C. Qaraqosh, J. Sulemaniyya zo""a, J. Urmi zoa.","[78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92]"
"1.4.2. Pharyngals and Laryngals1.4.2.1. *˙
The unvoiced pharyngal fricative *˙ has in most cases shifted to the velar
fricative /x/, e.g.     xmara               ‘ass’                     < *˙màrà
     xawra               ‘friend’                  < *˙a∫rà
     ""urxa               ‘road’                    < *""ur˙à
     p°x                 ‘to open’                 < *pt˙
     šlx                 ‘to strip’                < *šl˙The pharyngal has been retained in the environment of /q/ in the word
r6˙qa ‘distant’, but the articulation of this as a pharyngal is not consistent
and speakers sometimes pronounce it as a velar fricative r6xqa. The original
pharyngal is likewise sporadically retained in ˙awla ‘rope’ (< *˙abla) as a
variant of the normal form xawla. Here the preservation of the pharyngal
is likely to have been conditioned by the fact that the other consonants of
the word have an intrinsic tendency to attract an emphatic articulation.
A further case where a pharyngal is occasionally retained is in the verbal
root gxk ~ g˙k ‘to laugh’.
    Elsewhere the pharyngal appears only in Arabic loanwords, a large
proportion of which are likely to have come into the language through
Kurdish. In many of these, however, the pronunciation of the pharyn-
gal is often weakened to the laryngal /h/, e.g. ˙eyw6n ~ heyw6n ‘animal’,
˙aj6tta ~ haj6tta ‘tool, instrument’, ˙awše ~ hawše ‘sheep-pen’, ˙uta ~ huta
‘whale’, ˙yr ~ hyr ‘to be confused’, ˙ammam ‘wash-room’, ˙akima ‘doctor’,
l6˙efa ‘quilt’, ta˙ela ‘spleen’, ˙aqqu°a ‘right’. In a few Arabic loanwords a
/˙/ has shifted to the velar fricative /x/ as in words of Aramaic stock,
e.g. mazaxa ‘area below millstones in a water-mill’ < Arab. masà˙a, xmy
‘to keep, to guard’ < Arab. ˙my.
    The presence of /˙/ in Arabic loans may give rise to minimal pairs
in which the /˙/ constrasts phonemically with a /x/ that derives histori-
cally from *˙, e.g.     ˙yr ‘to be confused’ : xyr ‘to look’
54                             chapter oneAn exceptional development of *˙ > /h/ is found in the Aramaic words
h6šše ‘senses’ (< *˙aššè) and hašya ‘chive’ (cf. Syr. ˙aššà, ˙àšà). This has
probably come about in order to distinguish them from the word xašša
‘suffering’ (< *˙aššà), which appears to be a doublet of h6šše.","[92, 93]"

       (A20:6)Further examples from non-narrative discourse in the text corpus are

       ‘Today, everything that I hear here, my mother has told me and
       I know it.’ (B8:15)On some occasions the deictic copula is used with the infinitive when it
has an iterative usage. As with the narrative usage, the motivation for the
deictic copula is generally to direct particular attention to a clause that
occurs at some kind of boundary in the discourse. In (49)–(51) the deictic
copula occurs at the onset of a segment of discourse. Example (49) is the
opening of a section of direct speech and (50) coincides with a shift in
subject referent and also a temporal shift marked by the adverb ‘now’. In
(51) the deictic copula occurs at the onset of a chain of clauses in which
there is a shift in subject referent. The situation described in this chain

an additional motivation for drawing attention to it by the deictic copula.
In (52) the deictic copula gives weight to the closing clause in a section
describing the iterative situation in which a certain character in the nar-
rative sings. The infinitive here has the b- preposition, the motivation for
which here may also be to give the clause additional morphological end
weighting.  (49) kúlla náša hóle zála l-šùla.} ""àp-""ana bt-áz6n šúla} pàlx6n.} ‘Everybody

The infinitive construction is used in some performative verbs, which
perform an action by their utterance rather than make a truth-evaluable
description of a situation. In this function the construction has a perfective
aspect, as in the narrative present and iterative functions. Characteristi-
cally of its perfective use elsewhere, there is a greater tendency to use the
enclitic copula than when it expresses progressive aspect. Performative
usage is attested in the verb mqawole ‘to promise’, e.g.  (1)   mqawòl5w6n,} ""ap-""an-zúze kúlla t-in šqìl6lla} p>lènna pàlge.} ‘I promise,
        I’ll divide into halves also all the money that I took.’ (A1:17)The expression ‘I say to you’ in contexts such (2)–(4) also has a perfor-
mative function, which no doubt explains why it is used with an enclitic
copula:  (2)   már6nnux plú† m-àxxa.} ‘I say to you: Leave here!’ (A12:5)
  (3)   màr6nnux} ""áti grùš gánux.} ‘I say to you: Go away!’ (A12:10)

       ‘ “What will you say to me?” He said “I say to you: Yes, it’s true,

The positive clitic copula of the construction may be moved to a con-
stituent that occurs before or after the infinitive in the same types of
environment that condition the movement of the copula in the resulta-
tive construction described in §15.4.1.4. This can be seen in several of
the examples cited already above. Further examples classified into their
various functional types are:15.4.2.6.1. Leftward Movement of the Enclitic(i) Narrow Information Focus   (1) ""àtit wáða ""ixála?} ‘Are you making food (not somebody else)?’

This is found only where the construction is used with a perfective aspect,
either to express a narrative present or an iterative event, i.e. where it is
common to have an enclitic rather than a deictic copula. As in the resulta-
tive construction, the purpose of the rightward movement onto the final
item of the predicate is to give prominence, but not narrow information
focus, either to the item to which it is attached or to the clause as a whole.
In the examples attested in the text corpus, the construction is used to give
added prominence to the clause in order to signal some kind of boundary
in the discourse, marking off the clause from what precedes or follows.
In (1) the clause describing the tying of the bands marks the closure of
the chain of events in the marriage ceremony. In (2) the construction
occurs at the beginning of a segment of discourse that presents elabora-
tive information on what precedes. In (3) the construction separates the
second clause distinctly from the first to express a contrastive opposition
between the action of Barz6kko and that of his companions.  (1) bár t-ila-báxta pyáša rásmi tàma} yá'ni wára gu-l-bˆ°a,} °áy5le qàša} ""u-sá‰a
      gnùn5le.} ‘After the woman becomes official there, that is she enters

720                           chapter fifteen      they become big, the job to maintain them is bigger, and you must
      be very careful.’ (B5:105)
  (3) ""ánna kúlla dmàx5la.} Barzèkko pyáša ˙àr6s-ile.} ‘They all went to sleep.
      Barz6kko became the guard.’ (A12:9)15.4.2.7. Infinitive Combined with the Past Copula
The infinitive may be combined with the past copula (for the morphology
of this compound form see §8.19.4.5.). This expresses the past progressive.
It is typically used in narrative to denote an action or situation that was
in progress in the past and overlapped temporally with the occurrence
of a punctual event, e.g.  (1) zàl5wa,} xá-bena xzéle m-rè˙qa xá-mdi xwàra.} ‘As he was going along,
      he suddenly saw from afar something white.’ (A14:28)
  (2) xà-yoma} dèbba xðára-wawa gu-†uràne.} tfíqla b-xa-tèla.} ‘One day a bear
      was wandering around the mountains. She met a fox.’ (A20:1)
  (3) xðár6nwa l-ày-goti,} ""áqli tíwla š-""áql6t bàxta.} ‘I was turning over to
      my (other) side and my leg settled on the leg of the woman.’
      (A16:11)
  (4) mèr6x ""èlla mtanìla} ""u-xa-mašmóye-wewa ""6llˆni láz6m.} ‘You said “You must
      tell it” and somebody must have been listening to us.’ (A35:19)
  (5) m>‰òy6nwala,} gu-ðà-"">ra.} . . . q6m-maxyále púmma díya l-rêzza} ‘I was
      grazing it in a certain piece of land. . . . It put its mouth in the rice.’
      (B5:131)Note the preposing of the copula before the infinitive when the construc-
tion is combined with the particle har ‘still’ in (6). This can be compared
to the leftward movement of the copula onto initial adverbials in other
types of compound verbal constructions (e.g. yóma hádele zrìqa} ‘The sun
has just now risen’ §15.4.1.4.1. example 30):  (6) píšle yòma} hár-wewa xðàra,} xzéle xa-b6ßlíßa zòra.} ‘Day came and he was
      still searching about, when he saw a small ray of light.’ (A14:24)If two or more infinitives are concatenated, the copula may be omitted
after its use on the first one of the series, e.g.  (7) zílla xákma šênne,} málka hár xzàya-wewa,} b-xzáya mbaqóre l-d-ò-naša.}
      ‘Several years went by (during which) the king was investigating and
      inquiring concerning the man.’ (A8:5)

        ""arxà°a.} ‘But all of these—the women were not becomng pregnant,
        the goats were not producing young, the mills were not (produc-
        ing).’ (A38:1)The temporal overlap function of the form is used in (9) to present an
explanation of a previous statement of a character in the narrative:  (9)   màr5wa} har-""àww5le} ""6n-""ítle nawàge.} ‘He was saying (he meant by
        this) “Is he just him (alone) or does he have grandchildren?” ’
        (A17:16)The construction is used in non-narrative discourse to express the temporal
overlap of an action with iterative events in the past. In the cases where
this is attested in the text corpus the copula is placed before the infinitive.
In §15.3.6. it has been shown that clauses in which the past copula is
placed before the predicate express in principle some kind of communi-
cative salience. This is likely to be the case here, since in both examples
two clauses with the infinitive construction are set up in opposition. The
preposing of the copula is used to mark off the two clauses distinctly from
one another. Another factor for the preposing of the copula in the phrase
har-iwa-práma of (10) may be the particle har, as is the case in (6) above:  (10) ""áy mòdi q†á""a †árpa?} q>†ìwale,} xá har-iwa-práma zdáya l-9ra-w} ""an-xéne
       ""iyáwa bá°re bá°re wáða †àxe} ‘What is the cutting down of leaves?
       They cut them down, one person cutting and throwing them on
       the ground, while others were behind him making small piles.’
       (B5:118)
  (11) m-bar-hàd6x} q5mìwa} mzabóne ""ilàna.} náše ""íwa kòpa} kùlla,} ""u-""áwwa
       gárewa ràma.} ""áwwa náše ""iy7wa kúlla spára kòpa.} ""a-""ilána mzabnìwala
       y-amrèxxa.} ‘After that they would sell the tree. The people were all
       below and he (the groom) was high up on the roof, all the people
       were waiting below. They sold the tree, as we say.’ (B5:42)Note also (12), in which the temporal overlap function with an ongoing
situation is used to express a concessive sense. The ongoing negated situ-
ation can be considered to be iterative (‘on no occasion have they asked
for you’):  (12) hadíya xon>wà°ux,} már6twa xon>wà°i,} ""áyya xá-šeta hóla támma láxxa
       l7la mbaqorêllux.} ‘Now your brothers—(although) you called (them)
722                             chapter fifteen        “my brothers”, it has been a year that they have been here but
        have not (even once) asked for you.’ (A26:78)As is the case with the present copula, the motivation for the preposing
of the past copula is sometimes to cliticize it to constituents of the clause
that stand before the infinitive. In (13) and (14), for example, it is cliticized
to the subordinating particle D:  (13) ""án-zuz6t ""a°íwa m6n-mzabánt6t ""ilàna} ""íwa hayàrta} qa-k yálo-w xêtna} t-íwa
       gwàra.} ‘The money that was received from the sale of the house
       was assistance for the bride and groom who were getting married.’
       (B15:67)
  (14) madàm t-iwètwa pláxa ""átxa m6ndiyáne} t-amrènnux mò-""oð6t?} ‘Since
       you have been doing such things, should I tell you what to do?’
       (A14:79)15.4.2.8. Infinitive Combined with the Verb hwy
The copula in the infinitive construction may be replaced by various
inflections of the verb hwy in certain contexts. The following forms are
attested in the text corpus.15.4.2.8.1. hawe q†ala
This form is found in the protasis of conditional constructions referring
to a progressive action that overlaps temporally with that of the apodosis,
e.g.  (1)   ""6n-háwe plá†a m6n-""èrxe †íša qàmxa,} lá h>mèn6t ""êlle.} ‘If he is coming
        out of the water-mill covered in flour, do not trust him.’ (D2:61)15.4.2.8.2. y-awe q†ala
This is found in (1), where it expresses a habitual progressive, denoting an
activity that was habitually in progress and overlapping temporally with
another activity or situation. The construction here has past time refer-
ence by taking the past reference of the verbs in the preceding context
as its deictic centre:  (1)   sab-xa-xa-gáye ""i-maxéwa tmanyà sa""êtte} bar-©ðáðe t-là-kl5°a.} tmanyá sa""ètte
        y-áwa mxàya} ""u-náše dwìqe.} ‘For, sometimes, they played for eight
        hours continuously without stopping. They would be playing for
        eight hours while the people held (each other).’ (B15:77)
                             the syntax of verbs                                72315.4.2.8.3. y-awewa q†ala
This form expresses a habitual progressive in the past. In (1)–(3) it is used
to denote an activity that habitually overlapped with another activity or
situation:  (1) ßalènwa y-awéwa rxà°a.} ‘I would go down while it was fermenting.’
      (B5:212)
  (2) ""í°wa †awalyá°a rábe ràbe} m†alìwa.} ""ò yóma} kúlle yòma} y-awáwa m†awòle}
      ""u-náš6t má°a kùlla} síqe mparóje biyèy.} ‘There were many games that
      they played. They would be playing all that day and (while they
      were doing so) all the people of the village would go up to look at
      them.’ (B7:4)
  (3) béna bálki ""o-nàša,} ""o-xêtna t-ámr6x,} ""o-""ùrza,} lˆwe táma.} y-awéwa pláxa
      gu-mðinà°a m8°>lan.} ‘Perhaps the person, that is the groom, the
      man, was not there. He was working (at that time) in the towns,
      for example.’ (B5:18)In (4) and (5) it is used to express a habitual activity that was temporally
delimited. The end of this activity is mentioned in the context. In (4) the
people in question ceased to worship God when they had a son. In (5)
the habitual bad behaviour of the child at school was short-lived since
we are told in the following context that he was expelled:  (4) hál xámši-w xámša šênne} y-aw7wa sxáða ""alàha,} y-ám6r ya-""alàha,} yawètl6n
      xa-bròna.} ""ím6t ""aláha yíwle ""6lléy bròna} šuréla manšóy6lle ""alàha,} là txára
      ""álaha,} ""u-là-mßal5wa qa-""álaha.} ‘For fifty-five years they were wor-
      shipping God, he (the man) would say “Oh God, give us a son.”
      When God gave them a son, they began to forget God, they did
      not remember God and did not pray to God.’ (A15:17)
  (5) qímla mšodèrra bròn-díya m6dràsa.} bróna díya gu-m6drása kút-yum y-awéwa
      mxáya l-aw-yàla,} šqála ‘ánta d-àwwa,} šrà†a m6ndiyáne.} ‘She sent her
      son to school. Her son everyday in school would beat one child,
      take the bag of another, tear things.’ (A14:5)15.4.2.8.4. t-awe q†ala
This construction is formed by combining the future b6d-qa†6l form of hwy
with the infinitive. In most cases it expresses a future progressive. It may
be used to denote an activity that will be in progress when a perfective
future action takes place, e.g.
724                              chapter fifteen  (1) ""íman má†6n têmm6l,} ""áw t-áwe pláxa gu-bˆ°a.} ‘When I arrive tomorrow,
      he will be working in the house.’
  (2) qa-d-áwwa ""áw6ð xa-‘ˆra,} ""6n-t-áwe ràqa,} qa-t-""áw6ð xa-‘ˆra qa-gáne.} ‘so
      that he could find a solution, so that, if he had to flee, he could
      find for himself a solution.’ (A18:17)It may denote a perfective future action that has a quantifiable duration.
This differs from the b6d-qa†6l form, which is unmarked with regard to the
durability of the action, e.g.  (3) tre-†¬á yománe xéne bt-áw6t ma†róye xàß-sùsa.} ‘You shall ride on horse
      back two or three more days.’ (A8:46)The t-awe q†ala form may also be used to express a temporally delimited
habitual activity in the future. In (4) the existence of an endpoint is implied
by the question ‘until when?’ In (5) the sense is that the horse will be
screeching during each interval of time in which the salt strikes his legs:  (4) hal-""ìman t-áw6t hátxa mdagóle?} ‘For how long will you be telling lies?’
      (A26:56)
  (5) mèlxa maxéla ""aqlá°e dìye,} t-áwe súsa mßarßòre.} ‘Salt will strike his legs
      and the horse will screech.’ (A24:12)In (6) it is used as a modal progressive, expressing deontic possibility in
a question, which is one of the functions of the b6d-qa†6l form (§15.1.5.2.
examples 16–18):  (6) ""ˆka t-áwe mašmóye?} ‘Where could he be listening?’ (A35:20)In (7) the form is used to express an iterative activity in the past that is
temporally limited, which, as we have seen (§15.4.2.7.3.), is expressed
elsewhere with the y-awewa q†ala form. The purpose of using the t-awe
form of hwy is to express sequentiality to what precedes, which is one of
the functions of the b6d-qa†6l form (§15.1.5.4.):  (7) wírra š6kwánta qam7°a šqilála ða-˙ábba ""u-plì†la.} wírra t-tèrte šqilála
      ða-˙ábba-w plì†la.} wírra t-†è¬¬6° ða-˙ábba-w plì†la.} . . . ha-t-xáßli ""an-xê††e,}
      ""an-š6kwáne t-áw5 ðà-ða wára.} ‘The first ant went in and took one
      grain, then went out. The second went in and took a grain and went
      out. The third went in (and took) a grain and went out . . . and the
      ants were going in one by one until the wheat finished.’ (A36:5)

The perfective q†ille form of hwy is combined with the infinitive to express
a complete event in the past that has a finite duration with a starting-point
and end-point. The distinction between wele q†ala and other narrative
verbal forms such as q†ille and q†il5le is that this infinitive form explicitly
expresses duration in the past whereas the others do not specify this. Since
the event expressed by this form has an endpoint, it can be followed by
sequential actions, as is the case in (3) and (4):  (1) m6n-d-7-dan6t brèla} hál d-5-dán6t m†éla l-yàla,} wéla bxàya.} ‘From the
      time she was born until the time that she came to the boy she wept.’
      (A25:4)
  (2) ""ána k6mà dána t-in-mßalóye †la-márya ""àlaha} ta-t-yawèlli ""êmma dáwe.} ""u-
      ""áwwa huðáya wéle maßyó°e n†ára ""èlli l-gàre.} ‘I was praying to the Lord
      God so many times to give me a hundred gold coins. This Jew was
      listening and watching me on the roof (during this time period).’
      (A6:10)
  (3) har-wéla taq-táq mxàya} ""u-taq-tàq,} xá-bena-w trè,} w-áwwa sqìdle.} ‘They
      made a taq-taq knocking noise, taq-taq, once, then twice, then he
      became fed up.’ (A14:68)
  (4) ""àwwa} Xáno xzéle ""o-dídwa plí†le m6n-naxír6t málka mujêble.} wéle spàra,}
      xár°a xá-ga xéta xzèle} ""o-dìdwa} plí†le m6n-d-ó bór6t kèpe.} ‘Xano saw the
      fly come out of the nose of the king and was astonished. He waited
      (for some time) and then he saw the fly come back out of the pile
      of stones.’ (A11:5)Rather than denoting a complete event bounded by a start and an end,
the form is sometimes used ingressively to denote the start of a situation
without any definite endpoint. Another event mentioned in the ensuing
discourse, therefore, may take place while this situation still holds rather
than being sequential to its completion, e.g.  (5) ""ána síqa l-ßˆda,} dúnye wéla ràya,} ""ána wírri gu-xa-gêppa.} ‘I went up
      hunting, it started raining and so I went into a cave.’ (A28:6)
  (6) xá-ga xéta †líbla m6n-márya ""àlaha,} kúlla wéla bráka †lìbla,} ßléla mê†ra.}
      ‘Then they made a request from the Lord God, they all started
      kneeling and made a request, and (as a consequence) rain fell.’
      (A11:18)
  (7) ""a-políse wéla pyáša b-x6mmèy.} ‘The policemen began to become wor-
      ried.’ (A8:10)
726                           chapter fifteen15.4.2.8.6. wiy5le q†ala
This form is attested in (1), where it is used to express an enduring but
complete event in the past that has a finite duration with a starting-point
and end-point. As we have seen, the same function is performed by wele
q†ala. This arises from the fact that the q†ille and q†il5le forms are used
interchangeably in narrative.  (1) ""è°y5le xa-nàša} xa-súsa smòqa,} kúlle lwíša smòqa,} wíy6x pláša m-""aßèrta
      hal-gu-mbadlà°a.} lan-mèßya bíye dìye.} ‘A man came, on a red horse,
      all dressed in red. We fought from evening until morning. I could
      not prevail against him.’ (A12:19)15.4.2.9. Combined with Existential Particle
The infinitive form pyaša is sometimes combined with the existential par-
ticle when the verb has the sense of ‘to remain’. All the attested examples
have the negative particle:  (1) ‘ú m6ndí lítla pyàša.} ‘She no longer had anything.’ (A26:59)
  (2) lítlux pyáša pêrß6t,} dìya qa†lèxlux.} ‘You no longer have any opportunity
      (for escape), we shall kill you right now.’ (A26:76)
  (3) li°-pyáša ""ánna t-amrèxxa bòla díye.} ‘No more of its heads, as we call
      them, remain.’ (B5:97)
           15.5. Other Constructions with the Infinitive15.5.1. General Remarks
In some sections of the foregoing treatment of the compound infini-
tive construction with the verb ‘to be’ mention has been made of some
contexts in which the auxiliary verb is omitted. Most examples of this
omission cited above are infinitive constructions in narrative occurring
after a preceding infinitive bearing the copula, or occasionally before a
following infinitive bearing the copula. In such cases the infinitive with-
out the copula expresses an event that is closely connected with that of
the preceding or following clause respectively, in that they are presented
as being components of the same overall event. In this section we shall
examine further contexts in which an infinitive lacking a copula or form
of the verb hwy is used.
                              the syntax of verbs                                  727    With regard to the subject referent of an infinitive, this is in principle
either explicitly expressed together with the infinitive or, if not expressed,
it is the continuation of the subject referent of the preceding clause. An
exception to this is where the infinitive has an impersonal subject. This
is seen, for example, in (1), in which the infinitive †>ya has an impersonal,
unspecified 3pl. subject, which is not the subject of the preceding clause.
This infinitive, moreover, is the first of a sequence of two infinitives, the
preceding clauses having q†ille form verbs. The plural resultative participles
in the following clauses demonstrate that the subject of the infinitive is
3pl.:  (1) pílle šnèle.} †8ya bá°re díye la-xzày6lle.} xár°a tfíqe bíye xèzy6lle ""ína šênya,}
      npìla.} ‘He fell and fainted. They searched for him but did not find
      him. Then they came across him and found that he had fainted
      and fallen.’ (A14:87)In addition to narrative sequence, the infinitive is used in the contexts
described below. When the infinitive lacks the verb ‘to be’ in these con-
texts, it is still treated as a verb with regard to its syntactic relation to the
participants in the clause. The subject and direct object are combined
with the infinitive as they are with verbs, the infinitive never being linked
to these clausal participants by nominal annexation with the particle D.","[754, 755, 756, 757, 758, 759, 760, 761, 762, 763, 764, 765, 766]"
"19.1.1. Attributive Relative Clauses
Relative clauses that have attributive function are always placed after the
nominal that they modify. They may be explicitly connected to the head
nominal by the relative particle D, which is either prefixed to the first
word of the clause or is suffixed to the end of the head nominal, e.g. kut-
yala t-a°e laxxa ~ kut-yal6t ""a°e laxxa ‘Every child that comes here’. When
the particle is prefix to the first word of the clause, the final /a/ vowel
of the head noun is sometimes centralized to /6/ as is the case when the
particle is suffixed to it, e.g. ""áyya bráta šapìrt6 t-íla dmíxta kêsli ‘this beautiful
girl, who has fallen asleep with me’ (A26:6). The final /6/ is occasionally
elided, e.g. ""7-dàn t-á°ya kyàlo ‘at the time that the bride came’ (B8:32). A
D particle is sometimes elided, but the final vowel of the head nominal
remains /6/ rather than /a/ as if it were still present, e.g. ""5-d7rt6 z6dyálux
gáwa díya ‘the enclosure in which you threw it’ (< ""5-d5rt6t A15:18).
   Constructions with the particle D may be termed syndetic relative
clauses. Attributive relative clauses may also be placed after the head
nominal asyndetically, without the particle. The distribution of syndetic
and asyndetic attributive relative clauses is conditioned to a large extent by
the definiteness of the head nominal. A distinction should also be made
between restrictive relative clauses, which limit the reference of the head
noun, and non-restrictive ones, which present supplementary information
concerning a nominal without limiting its reference. This difference in
function sometimes gives rise to distinct syntactic structures.
952                           chapter nineteen19.1.1.1. Definite Head Nominal(i) Restrictive Clauses
When the head noun is definite, i.e. it has a specific identifiable refer-
ent or refers to an identifiable generic class, a restrictive relative clause
is syndetic. The clause has the function of an attributive modifier that
is embedded in the nominal phrase. It does not assert new information,
as is the case with an independent clause, but rather expresses informa-
tion that is presupposed to be known to the hearer. The clause supplies
a description that allows the hearer to identify the referent of the head
noun. The definite status of the head noun, therefore, is indissolubly
bound with the relative clause. In principle such a definite head noun is
introduced by an anaphoric demonstrative pronoun. This is usually the
default demonstrative pronoun, the basic function of which is to signal
that the referent of the noun is identifiable in the context to which it is
anaphorically linked. The restrictive relative clause, which is intended
to provide the means of identifying the referent, is sometimes the only
source of identification. The anaphoric link, therefore, is clearly internal
to the nominal phrase, e.g.  (1) ""an-suráye t-wáwa gu-Tùrkiya} zílla l-""Ir6n.} ‘The Christians who were in
      Turkey went to Iran.’ (B2:8)
  (2) šêdla,} gu-d-a-""8ra t-b8y6t mattêtle.} ‘You put the sapling in the land that
      you like.’ (B5:103)
  (3) ""7-baxta t-à°ya} b8y6n gawrênna} láz6m mtanyáli ða-q6ßßêtta.} ‘The woman
      who comes and I shall marry must tell me a story.’ (A36:1)In these constructions it can be said that the demonstrative is a correlative
with the relative particle. The demonstrative binds the head noun tightly
with the relative clause. This is because the interpretation of the noun with
the demonstrative depends on the relative clause and it cannot be inter-
preted successfully without it.
  In some cases the referent of the head noun has been mentioned in
the preceding context. Even here, however, the restrictive relative clause,
with which the head noun is syntactically linked, can be regarded as the
primary anaphor of the demonstrative and here also it has a correlative
function, e.g.  (4) ""7-brat6t malušíwala jùlle} t-oðíwala ""ax-kàlo.} ‘They made the girl whom
      they dressed in clothes like a bride.’ (B7:2)
                    syntactic subordination of clauses                          953  (5)   ""5-d7rt6 z6dyálux gáwa díya kúlla genàwela.} ‘(As for) the enclosure in
        which you threw it, they are all robbers.’ (A15:18)The relative clauses in (4) and (5) can be interpreted as restrictive, in that
the head noun requires further description to ensure that the correct
referent is distinguished from other possible members of the set of items
named by the noun that are associated in some way with the context and
are, therefore, available as possible referents for the noun. The purpose
of the relative clause, therefore, is not to supply further information but
rather to assist in the identification of the referent. The anaphoric demon-
strative, which invites the hearer to seek the identification of the referent
of the noun in the surrounding context, would naturally be interpreted
in the first instance as linked to the relative clause that is embedded in
the nominal phrase.
   Restrictive relative clauses are used also after head nouns that have an
adverbial function, e.g.  (6)  ""7-šet6t m7°i q6m-yaw•lla xa-bróna zòra.} ‘In the year they would die
       he gave them a small son.’ (A4:57)
  (7) ""áp-ana y-a°7wa b-rèši hátxa} ""o-yóm6 t-ínwa zòra.} ‘They would come into
       also my head when (literally: in the day that) I was young.’ (A26:12)
  (8) ""7-g6t damêxwa,} †¬a°à yomá°a} ""u-†¬a°à l5l>wá°a háwe dmìxa.} ‘When
       (literally: at the time that) he slept, he would be asleep for three
       days and three nights.’ (A29:2)
  (9) ""7-dàn t-á°ya kyàlo,} yawíwala mêšxa.} ‘When (literally: at the time that)
       the bride came, they would give her oil.’ (B8:32)
  (10) hál ""o-yóm6t mˆ°6n} har-""úrx6t ""álaha dóq6n b-ìði.} ‘Until the day I die I
       shall always keep to God’s way.’ (A15:21)In some cases the head noun of a restrictive relative clause has a speaker
deixis demonstrative, e.g.  (11) ""ána ""ap-dìya} ""áyya ""úrxa t-ín ""ána zála bíya dìya} lè-y manš•nna hál
       yom6t-màw°a.} ‘I shall not give up until the day I die the way I am
       following now.’ (A21:35)
  (12) qímli zílli šqílli ""áwwa júlla t-íle gu-púmm6t mzíð6t pràge.} ‘I went and took
       the cloth that is in the mouth of the bag of millet.’ (A23:23)
  (13) xzi-""ánna †¬a-nàše} t-íla prím6lle tàwra,} †¬á°na hon-yíwt6lla mò'6d.} ‘Take
       note that the three people who slaughtered the ox—I have made
       an assignation with the three of them.’ (A22:21)
954                           chapter nineteenIn cases such as (11)–(13) the speaker deixis demonstrative should be
interpreted as having an anaphoric rather than an ostensive, i.e. ‘pointing’,
function. As shown in §14.3.2., the speaker deixis demonstrative is often
used with an anaphoric function where the speaker wishes to present the
referent in question with close perspective. The relative clause is restrictive
since it expresses presuppositional information that is intended to assist
with the identification of the head noun.
   The correlative function of demonstrative pronouns in restrictive rela-
tive clause constructions whereby they are linked by anticipatory anaphora
to the following relative clause (14) is likely to have been modelled on
nominal relative clauses (15):  (14) ""o-gáw‰a t-íle gu-bˆ°a} ‘The man who is in the house’
  (15) ""o-t-íle gu-bˆ°a} ‘He who is in the house’In nominal relative clauses such as (15), which are always restrictive, the
demonstrative occurs as the obligatory head of the clause, which cannot
stand independently. The construction (14) can be regarded as an inter-
nal expansion of (15), whereby the nominal head is an extension of the
pronominal head.(ii) Non-restrictive clauses
Non-restrictive relative clauses following definite head nouns are semanti-
cally closer to independent clauses than attributive modifiers. Their purpose
is to supply an additional description of a referent that is assumed to be
already identifiable. They are, therefore, assertive rather than presuppo-
sitional, though the syntactically subordinate structure has the effect of
presenting the information as backgrounded. Examples:  (1)   m•re †la-Zìne,} t-b>yéla M9mo} ‘He said to Zine, whom M>mo loved’
        (A26:64)
  (2)   zìl5le} mùkl6lla táwre t-w7wa zráya.} ‘He went and stopped the oxen,
        which were ploughing.’ (A9:5)
  (3)   qímle b-zdáya m-x•lme díye t-wéwa xêzy6lle.} ‘He began to be afraid of
        his dream, which he had dreamt.’ (A8:19)
  (4)   ""u-""up-báxte dìye} t-íle gwìr6lla} rába hawnànt5la.} ‘Also his wife, whom
        he had married, was very clever.’ (A17:21)It can be seen that in some cases the relative clause is separated from the
head noun by an intonation group boundary. This feature, however, is not
                   syntactic subordination of clauses                         955exclusive to non-restrictive relative clauses, as can be seen in (13) in section
(i) above, where it occurs in a construction with a restrictive clause.
    In (5) it is separated from the head not only by an intonation group
boundary but also by intervening components of the clause:  (5) n•mu ""áyya b•rke d-ˆnila} t-it-""áti sxáya gàwa?} ‘Whose is this pool in which
      you are swimming?’ (A25:61)The non-restrictive relative clauses in constructions such as (1)–(5) may
express information that is familiar to the hearer, but, crucially, the speaker
is presenting them as assertions, albeit in some cases recapitulatory, rather
than as presuppositions. Sentences with an embedded non-restrictive
relative clause, therefore, contain two assertions, the truth of which can
be assessed independently of one another. In (1), for example, there are
two assertions, viz. (i) ‘He said to Zine’ and (ii) ‘M>mo loved Zine’. In a
sentence with an embedded restrictive relative clause, on the other hand,
there is only one assertion. Example (i 1), for instance, only asserts ‘The
Christians who were in Turkey went to Iran’. It does not entail the assertion
‘The Christians were in Turkey’. If an unidentified head noun requires
further delimitation in order for its referent to be identified, it is natural
to link it with a description based on a familiar, presupposed proposition
(‘There were Christians in Turkey’) rather than one based on an as yet
unknown proposition. When the head noun is identifiable in that it occurs
in a context where there is judged to be no possible confusion with other
members of the set of items named by the noun, any further description
must be assertive. As remarked, however, the syntactically subordinate
status of this assertion in the non-restrictive relative clause presents it as
background information. The informativeness of the clause may, indeed,
be very low, as in (4), where the hearer would naturally assume that if
a man has a wife, he would have married her! The construction can,
however, be interpreted as the assertion of an event that is added as an
afterthought, which would be equivalent to a sequence of clauses such as
‘He married a woman. His wife was also very clever’.
   The distinction between restrictive and non-restrictive relatives is based
on the availability of other potential referents for the head noun in the
particular context in which the construction occurs. In (6), for example,
the clause can be interpreted as restrictive and presuppositional, since
it occurs in a context where other girls are on the scene. In (7), on the
other hand, there is only one basket on the scene, so the relative should
be interpreted as non-restrictive and assertive.
956                            chapter nineteen  (6)   ""7-brat6t malušíwala jùlle} t-oðíwala ""ax-kàlo.} ‘They made the girl whom
        they dressed in clothes like a bride.’ (B7:2)
  (7)   hat šmí†le ""5-sála t-wéwa zqìr6lla.} ‘Until the basket which he had
        woven was shattered.’ (A20:4)In the context preceding (7), it has already been stated that the character
in question wove the basket. The assertion of the relative clause, there-
fore, must be expressing recapitulatory backgrounded information. An
assertion with such a low degree of informativeness appears, indeed, to
be closely related pragmatically to a presupposition. It is, no doubt, for
this reason that a relative construction is used to express both types of
clauses. Moreover the less informative the relative clause is, the more it
serves as a device to recapitulate and refresh the identification of the
noun, the closer it is in function to that of a restrictive relative clause.
The pragmatic relationship between a presupposition and an assertion
can be regarded as a continuum rather than a clear dichotomy, which
one can represent thus:Presupposition > Recapitulatory backgrounded assertion > backgrounded
assertion > foregrounded assertionIt follows, therefore, that the relationship between restrictive and non-restric-
tive relative clauses is a continuum rather than a distinct dichotomy.
    A feature that is distinctive of many non-restrictive clauses is the absence
of a correlative demonstrative on the head noun that binds the head to the
relative clause. In examples (1)–(4) the head has no demonstrative. In some
cases the head noun has a demonstrative, but this cannot be interpreted
as having a correlative function. Consider the following cases:  (8)  xzìg6n} ""áyya bráta šapìrt6 t-íla dmíxta kêsli.} ‘Look at this beautiful girl,
       who has fallen asleep with me.’ (A26:6)
  (9) ""u-d5r7le r6š-d-ó-sela t-íle núra xó°e xamìma.} ‘They put it on the grid-
       dle, under which there is fire (and which is) hot.’ (B6:47)
  (10) hat šmí†le ""5-sála t-wéwa zqìr6lla.} ‘Until the basket which he had
       woven was shattered.’ (A20:4)In (8) the speaker deixis demonstrative is ostensive and points to the ref-
erent in the speech situation, the relative clause supplying an additional
description of the girl, which is not essential for identifying the referent
of the noun. In (9) and (10), already considered above, the head noun
                    syntactic subordination of clauses                         957has been mentioned previously and there are no competing referents in
the context. The default demonstratives, therefore, can be interpreted as
binding the noun anaphorically to the preceding context. Since, however,
in both cases the relative clauses are low in informativeness and recapitu-
late information that has already been given, it can be said that they play
a role of refreshing the identification of the head noun, especially since
the head nouns have no other attributes that assist in identification. The
demonstratives would, therefore, have some kind of anaphoric relation-
ship also with the relative clause as well as with the mention of the noun
in the preceding context.
   In (11) the head noun has the demonstrative + indefinite article construc-
tion (""an-xa), which links the noun anaphorically with an earlier conversation
in the memory of the interlocutor (§14.3.5.). The relative is non-restrictive,
since the noun refers to the entire class and does not extract a sub-set
of ‘washing-boards’ that is in contrast to another sub-set. As in (9) and
(10), the content of the relative clause is recapitulatory in nature and is
intended to assist refreshing the identification of the referent:  (11) q6m-qa†líle b-xa†oryà°a,} ""an-xá xa†oryá°a t-ínwa màr6llux} mási jùlle bíya.}
       ‘They killed him with washing-boards, the washing-boards which
       I was telling you they used to wash clothes with.’ (B19:9)The head of a non-restrictive relative may be an adverbial expression, as
in constructions such as (12) and (13):  (12) ""•dyo t-íla mì°ta,} hótu pšàma ""•lla díya.} ‘Today, when it has died, you
       are sad about it.’ (A5:10)  (13) dìya} t-xzéle málka dúnye ráya pà‰e} zawn-šlàm5le.} ‘Now that the king
       has seen it raining lambs, it is the time of peace.’ (A1:26)A non-restrictive relative clause sometimes has the form of a nominal
relative clause, with a pronominal head, placed in apposition to the
antecedent noun, e.g.  (14) ""ína bráta d-o-Xáno Lapzèrin,} d-o-t-wéwa b•nya D6mdêma,} b>yáwa
       ta-bròn-màlka.} ‘But the daughter of that Xano the Golden Hand,
       who had built D6md6ma, loved the son of the king.’ (A11:17)
  (15) ""•°y5le ""o-gàw‰a díya,} ""o-t-wéwa mù°y6lla.} ‘That husband of hers came
       back, the one who had brought her.’ (A12:53)
958                           chapter nineteen  (16) m•re †la-xuláme dìye} ""o-t-wéwa ""•°ya m6n-ßˆda} ‘He said to his servant,
       who had come from the hunt’ (A25:54)
  (17) m-yêmmin šmít6lla ""áyya,} m-bnòn-mámi ""an-t-w7wa gò‰e.} ‘I heard this
       from my mother, from my cousins, who were older.’ (B8:5)These types of construction typically occur where the referent of the
head noun is unambiguously identifiable due to the noun being a proper
noun (15) or a noun that is delimited by a pronominal suffix (16–17). The
head noun is, therefore, not dependent on the relative clause either for
primary identification (restrictive) or for a refreshment of identification
as in (9) and (10) described above. The relative clause, therefore, can be
said to be pragmatically more independent from the head nominal than
is the case with restrictive constructions and constructions such as (9) and
(10). This greater degree of pragmatic independence is reflected by a
greater degree of syntactic independence, in that the nominal relative is
potentially a free-standing item, which is in apposition to the preceding
noun. An attributive relative clause without this opening demonstrative,
on the other hand, is a dependent modifier and is linked indissolubly to
the antecedent noun.
   Note that in (14) and (15) the antecedent noun has a demonstrative,
which refers anaphorically to the preceding context. In (14) the genitive
particle that is attached to the head noun (d-o-Xáno Lapzèrin) is repeated
on the appositive relative phrase (d-o-t-wéwa b•nya D6mdêma). For this phe-
nomenon in other appositional constructions see §14.7.
   In (18) an appositive type of non-restrictive relative clause follows a head
noun whose referent is a generic class and so is assumed to be identifiable:  (18) béna ""í° linyà°a,} lìne,} linyá°a ""an-t-íla ""àxÄar.} ‘There were pots, pots,
       pots, which are green.’ (B10:75)In some cases clauses expressing supplementary background information
which could be translated idiomatically into English by a non-restrictive
relative clauses are presented as an independent clause juxtaposed asyn-
detically after a definite noun, e.g.  (19) ßléla yóm6t trè} ""al-f 9qih,} ""ítle d6kkàna.} ‘She went down the next day
       to the jurist, who had a shop.’ (A22:16)
  (20) módi b6d-manáy6 d-áyya †àsa} dàwa,} šqilál6n m-àxxa,} n6blál6n gu-d-yáha
       dˆrta?} ‘What about the meaning of that golden bowl, which we took
       from here and took away to that house enclosure?’ (A15:17)

When the head nominal is indefinite, an attributive relative clause may
be syndetic or asyndetic.(i) Restrictive Clauses
When the relative clause after an indefinite head noun is restrictive, the
construction is usually syndetic. Only an indefinite noun with a non-specific
referent can have a restrictive relative clause. The restrictive relative clause
does not assist in identification of the referent, since indefinite nominal
phrases in principle have an unidentified referent. Rather the clause nar-
rows the extension of the set denoted by the noun. In many cases the
indefinite noun has a universal quantifier (kut, kull). The verb in the relative
clause is either in a realis form (1–3) or in an irrealis form (4–6):  (1) kú-duk6 t-íla m5°êtlali.} ‘Bring her to me wherever she is.’ (A4:8)
  (2) xáðr6x xázexi xa-nàša} t-íle palàxa} ""u-t-yáxla ""•lle dìye.} ‘Let’s look and
      find a man who is a hard worker and give her to him.’ (A21:3)
  (3) kú-m6ndi t-ítley t-yáwi ""êllux.} ‘They will give you everything that they
      have.’ (B7:7)
  (4) ku-náš6t ""àw6r,} ku-xayú°6t ""áw6r gu-d-ay-wàdi} ""ánna š6kwáne t-axlìla.} ‘Any
      person who enters, every living thing that enters in this valley, the
      ants will eat it.’ (A14:55)
  (5) hátxa xazêxwale} ku-dùk°a t-awéwa.} ‘We would see him wherever he
      could be.’ (B9:29)
  (6) kúl-naša t-awéle xa-bròna,} . . . ""i-nablíle l-""ùmra.} ‘Anybody who has a
      son, . . . they take him to the church.’ (B6:35)The difference between the constructions with the realis form and those
with the irrealis form relates to commitment of the speaker to the existence
of the class denoted by the nominal phrase. As remarked, in all cases the
nominal has a non-specific referent. When the realis is used, the speaker
is committed to the existence of at least one referent in the class denoted
by the phrase, although he is not referring to one particular member of
this class. In (1) the speaker is committed to the existence ‘a place where
she is’, i.e. that there is some place where she is to be found. In (2) the
implication is that there is some man who is a hard worker, though the
speaker is not referring to anyone particular in this class. In (3) the impli-
cation is that the people in question have some possessions that they can
give. When, on the other hand, the irrealis is used, the speaker is not
committed to the existence of any referent in the class. The existence
960                             chapter nineteenof such a referent is only hypothetical and the class may be empty.1 In
(4) the speaker is not committed to the existence of a person who enters
the valley, but presents it as a hypothetical possibility. It is, therefore,
equivalent to the hypothetical conditional construction ‘If a person were
to enter . . .’. In (5) the speakers are not committed to the existence of any
place where the man in question is to be found, i.e. he has disappeared.
In (6) the speaker presents the birth of a son to a person as a possibility
(= If somebody has a son . . .) rather than a certainty (= When somebody
has a son . . .). It is presented as a hypothetical case with regard to one
representative individual of the set.
   It should be noted that in some cases, particularly in subordinate clauses,
the qa†6l or qa†6lwa forms are used in a habitual indicative sense and so are
not formally distinguished from their irrealis usage (§15.1.1.3., §15.1.2.2.).
The realis or the irrealis meaning of the verb in the relative clause must,
therefore, be deduced from the context. In a construction such as (7), for
example, where there is an explicit statement of the existence of referents
of the class, the verb must be interpreted as realis:  (7) ""í°wa baxtá°a t-y8ði t-yàpi.} ‘There were women who knew how to
      bake.’ (B5:16)The use of the realis copula in the relative clause modifier of the pred-
icative noun in (8) commits the speaker to the fact that the person was a
good man who brought the coins. What he is denying is that he became
such a man of his own accord:  (8) l5t-""áti wíya xoš-náša t-it-mú°y6lla ""ánna zùze.} záwna wíy5le t-šlàma} ""áp-
      ati píšlux náš6t šlàma.} ‘You have not become a good man who has
      brought those coins. Time became one of peace and so also you
      became a man of peace.’ (A2:26)A t- prefix attached to an initial / ""/ verb that has a future sense could, in
principle, be interpreted as the future verbal prefix or the relative particle, e.g.  (9) ku-b7°a t-àzeti} ""áni t-yawìlux.} ‘Every home that you go to will give you
      something.’ (B7:7)
   1
     This may be compared to the use of the subjunctive in relative clauses in Romance
languages such as French (cf. Kleiber 1987: 69–75).
                    syntactic subordination of clauses                           961  (10) t-áwð6t b-xàbri,} kú-m6ndi t-amrênnux?} ‘Will you act on my word,
       everything that I tell you?’ (A15:5)Occasionally the relative particle is omitted before a restrictive relative
clause that modifies an indefinite head noun, e.g.  (11) kút-duk°a ""áza ""àwra} ""áp ya-xéta bàra láz6m háwya.} ‘Every place that
       she goes to and enters, the other has to follow after her.’ (B12:2)
  (12) kút-dana sanqìwa,} ""u-šaqlíwa m6n-d-5-tÆtun.} ‘Whenever they needed
       it, they took some of that tobacco.’ (B7:18)
  (13) xá-naša l-xóðe lítle la-bába la-y•mma la-""àp-xa,} ""áw y-amrìle} lìtle náše.} ‘A
       man by himself, who does not have a father, a mother or anybody,
       they say that he has no relatives.’ (A17:17)
  (14) ku-brón6t b•‰-naša ""á°e l-d-áy j>zíra qamàye,} ""áwwa t-áwe málka diyˆxu.}
       ‘Whichever person comes to the island first, he will be your king.’
       (A14:46)In some cases such an asyndetic clause occurs after a class term in pred-
icative position, e.g.  (15) m5jíwale gu-míya šaxìne,} p5šíwa dàwwe} y-oðíwa bušàla bíya díya,} ""u-kót6l
       dàwke bíya díya.} ‘They crushed it in hot water and it became yoghurt
       water, with which they would make stew and yoghurt pasties.’
       (B7:23)(ii) Non-Restrictive Clauses
Unlike restrictive relative clauses, non-restrictive relative clauses may occur
both after indefinite nouns with specific referents and also after those with
non-specific referents.
    In the text corpus there are numerous occurrences of indefinite nouns
with a specific referent followed by a clause that can be rendered into
English by a non-restrictive relative clause. In such constructions the non-
restrictive clause is, in principle, juxtaposed asyndetically to the noun, e.g.  (1)   ""ì°wa} xa-ràbb6n,} tíw5wa gu-xa-g6ppì°a.} ‘There was once a monk who
        lived in a cave.’ (A15:1)
  (2)   ""í°wa xa-nàša} gu-ða-mà°a,} rába rába duglàna-wewa.} ‘There was a man
        in a village who was a great liar.’ (A48:1)
  (3)   ""í°wa xa-g•ppa gáwe díye ""àrbi hambišáye.} ‘There was a cave in which
        there were forty giants.’ (A24:54)
962                           chapter nineteen  (4)  ""í°wa xa-bustàna,} ""í°wa xabùše gáwa.} ‘There was a garden, in which
       there were apples.’ (A24:24)
  (5) ""í°wa xa-""á©a gu-Bˆrw6r,} š•mme Raš‰d-bek.} ‘There was an agha in
       Barwar whose name was Rašid Bek.’ (B19:1)
  (6) q6m-xazéle xa-nàša} mì°a} naból6lle m†amòr6lle.} ‘He saw a dead person,
       whom they were taking to bury.’ (A17:1)
  (7) hon-d•ry6lle gu-xa-‘ále ""amúqta lá-""am6ß ‘ù-ga ‘ú-ga pàl6†.} ‘I put him in
       a deep hole from which he could never come out.’ (A22:41)
  (8) ""ína hóla xá-qay6m°a k°íwta tàma,} málka Šlémun k°ìw6lla.} ‘They found
       there an inscribed monument, which king Solomon had written.’
       (A14:55)
  (9) šqílt5la xa-‘ánta hátxa á¬ì°5la.} ‘She took a basket that was full like
       this.’ (A22:13)
  (10) hón mquwálta m-xa-tèla} q6m-xal•ßli m-nêmra.} ‘I have given a promise
       to a fox who has saved me from a tiger.’ (A47:7)In the light of this pattern of construction, the t- particle on the verb in (11)
is best identified not as the relative particle but rather as a reduced form
of b6d- in a b6d-qa†6lwa functioning as a sequential habitual (§15.1.6.3.):  (11) ""í° xá †awálta xéta t-amríwala ""òr†a.} ‘There is another game, which
       is called ""o‰ta.’ (B11:25)If the non-restrictive relative clause is a copula clause, the copula is some-
times omitted, which is a reflection of the semantic dependence of the
clause on what precedes (§17.6.1.), e.g.  (12) hóle °éle xa-nàša,} rába qále basìma.} ‘A man has come, whose voice is
       very beautiful.’ (A25:46)19.1.1.3. Synopsis of Attributive Relative Structures
The predominant trends in the distribution of the various attributive rela-
tive structures may be summarized as follows, where AN = Antecedent
Noun, S = relative clause, D = relative particle:(i) AN—D—S        Definite AN+ restrictive S
        Definite AN + non-restrictive S
        Indefinite AN + restrictive S
                     syntactic subordination of clauses                963(ii) AN—""o-D—S     Definite AN + non-restrictive S(iii) AN—S (asyndetic)     Indefinite AN + non-restrictive S
     Indefinite AN + restrictive S
     Definite AN + non-restrictive SIt can be seen that connection with D (i) and asyndetic connection (iii)
are used for both definite and indefinite antecedent nouns. A connection
with a demonstrative pronoun ""o-D (ii) is available only for structures with
a definite antecedent. The tendency to use a synthetic connection with D
as opposed to an asyndetic connection depends on the definiteness of the
antecedent and on the restrictiveness of the relative. There is a greater
tendency to use the synthetic connection with the antecedent when it is
definite than when it is indefinite and there is a greater tendency to do
so when the relative is restrictive than when it is non-restrictive. These
tendencies may be represented thus:     Definite >       Indefinite
     Restrictive >    Non-restrictiveThe operation of these tendencies results in the fact that the synthetic
connection may be used with an indefinite antecedent, but this is limited
to restrictive relatives. With definite antecedents, on the other hand, the
synthetic connection has a wider distribution and may be used also with
non-restrictive relatives. The appositional type of connection with ""o-D is
available only for non-restrictive relatives with a definite antecedent. The
distribution of the various connection strategies may be represented in the
following table, in which the line running to the right of an item (——|)
indicates the extent of the distribution of this item:                        Restrictive > Non-restrictive
     Definite AN:       D ——————————|""o-D | Ø |
     Indefinite AN:     D —| Ø ———————————— |From a comparative point of view, it is worth noting that the appositional
type of relative clause with ""o-D has a wider distribution in some NENA
964                           chapter nineteendialects. In J. Arbel, for example, this type of structure is frequently used
to express restrictive as well as non-restrictive relatives, e.g.  (1) ˙éleq ""o-t-la-yàlwa,} ""ìtwa našé xe†íwa ta-©ér našé.} ‘Anyone who did not
      know (how to sew)—there were people who sewed for others.’ (Khan
      1999: 387)
  (2) kré ""o-t-lošìlu} ‘The suits that they wear’ (Khan 1999: 388)
  (3) ""iyyá m6ndixanòx ""o-t-mírox baqí.} ‘Here are the things of yours that you
      asked me for.’ (Khan 1999:388)The situation in C. Barwar, in which the appositional construction is
restricted to non-restrictive relatives may be regarded as typologically
more archaic. As remarked above, the looser syntactic connection of the
appositive nominal relative corresponds iconically to the looser pragmatic
connection of the non-restrictive relative to the antecedent noun. In
J. Arbel the apposition construction has been generalized from non-
restrictive to restrictive clauses. This has come about, no doubt, due to
the aforementioned lack of clear pragmatic dichotomy between the two
types of relatives.","[990, 991, 992, 993, 994, 995, 996, 997, 998, 999, 1000, 1001, 1002, 1003]"
"14.10.1. Intensity
Adjectives and adverbs are repeated with an intensifying function, e.g.  (1) mágl6t gilándi xá-mdi gò‰5le . . . †la-d-án m5rgáne gó‰e gò‰e.} ‘The scythe is
      something big . . . for the very big meadows.’ (B5:144)

  (5) lwíša júlle hátxa jálde jàlde.} ‘He put on his clothes very quickly.’
      (A4:55)The expression jalde jalde is often abbreviated to ja-jalde, e.g.  (6) mßaw°ítu m-ġðàðe,} ta-t-†úra ja-jálde pàr6q.} ‘You should speak with one
      another, so that the mountain ( journey) would finish very quickly.’
      (A17:19)In (7) a plural attributive demonstrative is repeated to convey an intensi-
fied quantity:  (7) ""ánna ""ánna šazàde} ""ánna jwànqe,} ""ánna náše kulla-""6°ye †làb6ll6x.} ‘These
      many princes, these young men, these people have all come to seek
      your hand.’ (A8:77)14.10.2. Increment
In some contexts nouns or adverbs are repeated to express gradual increase
or progression, e.g.  (1) t-la-náp6l ""o-rèzza ""urxà-w-urxa.} ‘so that the rice does not fall along
      the road.’ (B5:80)

Nouns are repeated in some distributive expressions, e.g.  (1)   qíma kút-yoma yóma ßlàya.} ‘Everyday he would get up to go down
        (to the pool).’ (A14:79)
  (2)   y-azèlwa ‘yàda,} b7°a bˆ°a.} ‘He would go to make an invitation, at

        ‘Everybody who went would stand, about four or five hundred
        people, in rows.’ (A8:31)
           14.11. Conjoining of Nouns in a Nominal PhraseTwo nouns in a compound nominal phrase are linked together by the con-
nective particle w. This may be attached as a clitic either to the beginning
of the second noun or to the end of the first noun. When in contact with
a consonant at the beginning of a word it is realized as ""u- (< *""uw), e.g.
                           the syntax of nominals                               557  (1)   xá-yoma ""í°wa xá-qaša ""u-xà-malla.} ‘Once there was a priest and a
        mullah.’ (A2:1)
  (2)   lát-xila xa-lèxma-w xa-bèta?} ‘Have you not eaten a loaf of bread
        and an egg?’ (A17:15)
  (3)   t-ámr6x ""ána w-àti} xóna-w xà°a.} ‘Let’s say I and you (we are) brother
        and sister.’ (A16:8)
  (4)   sab-kyálo-w xètna ""íwa málka-w malêk°a.} ‘since the bride and groom
        were the king and queen.’ (B15:71)The conjoining may have a concomitative sense, e.g.  (5)   xá-gaya y-asqêxwa} . . . kút-xa-w táxte dìye.} ‘Sometimes we went up
        (onto the roof ) . . . everybody with his bed.’ (B10:58)In such cases the two items are not coordinated but rather the first has
greater prominence. This may be reflected in verb agreement, in that the
verb in some cases agrees only with the first item. In (6), for example, the
verb is singular:  (6)   kèly5le gu-t8r6t b7°a ""áw ""u-""ày.} ‘He stood at the door of the house
        together with her.’ (A4:55)When three or more items are linked in a chain, the connective particle
is usually attached to each item before the one at the end of the chain,
e.g.  (7)   ""íwa záwn6t qè†la-w dèmma-w pràma.} ‘It was a time of killing, blood
        and slaughter.’ (A1:24)
  (8)   qèry6lle wazīr-díye ""u-xákma gu‰àne} ""u-báxte dìye.} ‘He called his minister,
        a few courtiers and his wife.’ (A4:40)
  (9)   b8y6n lá-""a°i b-xàšša} ""u-bxáya-w jnàna.} ‘I do not want them to come
        in sadness, weeping and singing dirges.’ (A4:33)The connective particle is used in some contexts as an intensifier of a
gradable relation or quality. In (10), for example, it intensifies the com-
parative adverbial:  (10) b-qáry6n ""u-hèš-biš záwda.} ‘I shall call yet louder.’ (A8:72)It is used in constructions expressing a range of items with the prepositions
m6n . . . ""u-hal ‘from . . . to’ in order to express increased extension, e.g.
558                          chapter fourteen  (11) kùll6n,} m6n-yále zóre ""u-hal-gò‰e} ‘all of us, from young children all
       the way to old people’ (B16:4)
  (12) m-ó-yoma dwíq6lle M8mo gu-hàbsa,} ""u-hàl-""6dyo.} ‘From that day he has
       held M>mo in prison, all the way until today.’ (A26:75)Lists of items, which are presented individually rather than linked together
in a composite whole, are in some cases expressed without any connective
particles, e.g.  (13) gêrwe,} ßàwle,} júlle rìxe,} júll6 j6rj∞t} ‘stockings, shoes, long clothes,
       clothes of purple fabric’ (B10:30)
  (14) y-awéwa wásta bra-qðàla,} br5°á°e rìxe} y-oðêxwala.} ‘There was the chest
       (of the blouse), the collar, long sleeves, which we would make.’
       (B10:45)
  (15) ""u-kúl-m6ndi y-áwe pêrya,} xàlta,} štˆ°a,} m-kùl-m6ndi.} ‘Everything was
       in abundance, food, drink, (something) of everything.’ (B15:63)A noun may be repeated to make the class denoted by it more general.
In most cases the second occurrence of the noun is introduced by the
particle ma-. The connective particle w may optionally occur before the
ma- particle (X ma-X ~ X ""u-ma-X), e.g.  (16) jawètta †la-pràma} ""anna q7se ma-qˆse.} ‘A chopper was for chopping
       wood and the like.’ (B5:141)
  (17) ""áxxa xuwwáwe ma-xuwwáwe lˆ-y-a°5 l-d-áwwa gèšra.} ‘Here snakes
       and the like will not come onto this bridge.’ (A30:49)
  (18) kúl-m6ndi d5r7wa bìya.} harmòne} ""u-ma-harmòne,} h5rmìye,} sparêgle.} ‘They
       would put everything on it. Pomegranates and the like, pears,
       quinces.’ (B8:31)
  (19) xóna m6nnˆxule,} l7la ta-t-""amráti †líba ma-†lìba.} ‘He is your brother,
       you should not say (that he) is a fiancé or something.’ (A25:22)On some occasions, instead of prefixing the ma- particle, the first consonant
of the second occurrence of the noun is replaced by a different consonant,
resulting in a word that has no meaning in isolation, e.g.  (20) ""ána háw6n Qára Tèždin,} ma°yán6t xárje-w bárj6t bo†anàye.} ‘I am Qara
       Teždin, the collector of taxes and the like of the people of Botan.’
       (A26:34)
                           the syntax of nominals                            559A related strategy is to repeat the word with a change of internal vocalic
pattern, e.g.  (21) bráte díye muttúla qáßre ""u-qaßòre.} ‘His daughter established villas and
       palaces.’ (A40:7)We may include here the combination of stem I and stem II resultative
participles in order to express intensity in contexts such as (22) and (23):  (22) b6d-p7š6t b-šòpi,} bríxta mburàxta.} ‘You will stand in my place, (you
       are) greatly blessed. (A40:15)
  (23) pàq6ð bába ""azíza,} xqìra,} gu-d-áyya dúnye mxùqra.} ‘Welcome dear,
       esteemed father, honoured in this world.’ (A40:12)In (24) the second resultative participle is from a cognate quadriliteral
verb:  (24) qóipew6x mqor6ópew6x.} ‘We are cut down and harvested.’ (A51:8)Another practice is to place the generic word m6ndi ‘thing’ in apposition
to the noun, e.g.  (25) kút-ile xíl6lle xa-ràmši-m6ndi} gu-bˆ°i} ""á°e xarèla gu-b7°i.} ‘Everyone
       who has eaten my dinner or the like (i.e. any food) in my house,
       let him come and defecate in my house.’ (A7:5)
                               14.12. NumeralsCardinal numerals are placed before the counted nominal, which follows
in apposition. The nominal is in the plural after all numerals above ‘one’,
unless it is a loanword that has not been adapted to Aramaic morphol-
ogy and does not take plural inflection. The only exception to this is the
word ""6mma ‘hundred’, which remains singular when preceded by numer-
als, e.g. tré ""èmma ‘two-hundred’, †¬á°a ""èmma ‘three-hundred’, ""árba ""èmma
‘four-hundred’. The word ""alpa ‘thousand’, by contrast, is made plural after
numerals, e.g. tré ""álpe ‘two-thousand’, †¬a°a ""alpe ‘three-thousand’, ""árba ""álpe
‘four-thousand’. The word ""6mma is plural in expressions such as ""6mmày6t
šènne} ‘hundreds of years’ (B15:92).
560                           chapter fourteen   In principle, the cardinal numerals from 1 to 10 exist in both mascu-
line and feminine forms in agreement with the gender of the noun they
are combined with. In practice, the masculine form is in the process of
becoming the default form in the dialect and is used with both masculine
and feminine nouns (§12.1.1., §14.1.2.). It is worth noting that the levelling
is regular in certain common multiplicative expressions. These include
phrases containing the word ""6mma ‘hundred’, which is historically femi-
nine, but regularly takes the masculine form of numeral. We should also
mention expressions containing the feminine nouns gaya and bena ‘time,
instance’, which regularly take the masculine cardinal xa rather than ða,
viz. xa-gaya, xa-bena ‘once’ (§14.1.2.).
   Most nouns ending in the singular nominal inflectional ending -a that
have a plural in -ane or -a°a can also form a plural with the shorter end-
ing -e, e.g. t>ra m. ‘door’ (pl. t>rane, t>re), qawra f. (pl. qawra°a, qawre). In
exceptional cases all three plural endings are used, e.g. yoma m. ‘day’ (pl.
yomane, yoma°a, yome). In the case of most such nouns, the shorter plural
form with the -e ending tends to be used after numerals, whereas the
long form is used for plurals denoting groups of an unspecified number
of items. There is a particular tendency for the short form to be used
with the numeral ‘two’. In all cases, however, these are only tendencies
and not absolute rules, e.g.      t>ra                               ‘door’
      tre t>re                           ‘two doors’
      †¬a t>rane                         ‘three doors’
      raba t>rane                        ‘many doors’      p6qqa                              ‘frog’
      tre p6qqe                          ‘two frogs’
      †¬a p6qqa°a                        ‘three frogs’
      raba p6qqa°a                       ‘many frogs’      yoma                               ‘day’
      tre yome                           ‘two days’
      †¬a yome ~ yomane ~ yoma°a         ‘three days’
      raba yomane ~ yoma°a               ‘many days’      gaya                               ‘time’
      tre gaye                           ‘two times’
      †¬a gaye                           ‘three times’
      raba gaya°a                        ‘many times’
                          the syntax of nominals                          561The -e plural ending of ""iða ‘hand’ and ""aqla ‘foot’ is regularly used in the
fixed expression ""iðe ""u-""aqle ‘arms and legs’ / ""aqle ""u-""iðe ‘legs and arms’,
whereas the plurals ""i°a°a and ""aqla°a are normal elsewhere, e.g.  (1) daw7ra ""íðe-w ""àqle.} ‘A mule (is a man’s) arms and legs.’ (B5:124)
  (2) šèry6lla ""áqle w-ìðe.} ‘He untied the legs and arms.’ (A10:13)The nouns baxta ‘woman’ and y6mma ‘mother’, which have human referents,
have the feminine plural ending -a°a in all contexts.
  This alternation between short and long plurals is rare in nouns end-
ing in the singular feminine endings -ta and -°a. A few nouns with the
femining ending -ta or -°a in the singular that have a plural in -a°a may
be given the plural ending -e after numerals, e.g.     k°5°a                     ‘chicken’
     t6rte k°aye               ‘two chickens’
     raba k°aya°a              ‘many chickens’Nouns that form a plural by reduplication of the final consonant in many
cases use a simple plural in -e after numerals, e.g.     p6‘‘a                     ‘piece’
     tre p6‘‘e                 ‘two pieces’
     raba p6‘‘a‘e              ‘many pieces’Numerals are sometimes repeated in order to express distribution, either
within one event (3) or across different events (4):  (3) kút-xa mènn6n t-ámr6x mátt6x †¬à°a †¬á°a tebálle.} ‘We each put down,
      let’s say, three marbles.’ (B11:25)
  (4) xa-xá-ga már6t b7°a mbašèlwa ""ixála ""ím6t hóya dàn6t ""ixála.} ‘Sometimes
      the owner of the house would cook food when it was time for food.’
      (B6:16)Numerals may be used independently of a head noun as an argument
in a clause, e.g.  (5) xà-qa†litu,} trè-qa†litu,} mò bt-óð6x b-ánna?} ‘You may kill one, you may
      kill two, but what will we do with (all the rest of ) them?’ (A14:44)
562                           chapter fourteen  (6)   ""áyya kìsta} hóle mxožèbn6lla max-xà.} ‘He has reckoned this bag as
        one.’ (A6:3)
  (7)   ""aßêrta} tre-ßléla. ‘In the evening two men went down.’ (A14:15)
  (8)   ""ánna tré""e z6rêk-ila.} ‘These two are strong.’ (B11:4)
  (9)   p7š6t làxxa} gu-bˆ°a} xòna} m6n-d-ánna bnà°i.} ""ítli †ê¬¬6°.} ‘Stay here in
        the house, brother, with these daughters of mine. I have three.’
        (A25:15)When an ordinal number is used independently of a head noun, it gener-
ally takes a pronominal head in the form of a demonstrative, e.g.  (10) ""o-qamáya miràle,} ""o-t-tré miràle.} ‘The first one said it, the second
       one said it.’ (A17:31)These phrases may be used in apposition to a nominal with the same
function as appositives consisting of a demonstrative head and an adjec-
tive (§14.7.). They are either non-restrictive appositives, e.g. Zìne,} ""a-t-têrte}
‘Zine, the second one’ (A25:20), or restrictive appositives with a contras-
tive function, e.g. ""7-ga ""5-t-tré ‘the second time (as opposed to the first),
secondly’ (B15:19).
   When the number of times is left imprecise, two or more numerals are
placed together asyndetically, e.g. xa-tré-yarxe xéne ‘one or two months later’
(A1:16), tre- ¬à-yarxe} ‘two or three months’ (A48:4), xámša ""6štà ganá°a} ‘five
or six people’ (B5:77), ""èšta šàwwa manzàle} ‘six or seven rooms’ (B10:52),
qám šáwwi tmáni šênne ‘seventy or eighty years ago’ (B5:179), yóm6 †¬á°a ""árba
‘on the third or fourth day’ (A14:91).
   A group of numbered items may be presented as a single whole by
placing xa before the phrase, e.g.  (11) mattìwa} t-ámr6x xá xámša dinàre.} ‘They would deposit let’s say a
       sum of five dinars.’ (B5:6)This construction is particularly common when two or more numerals are
juxtaposed to express approximation, e.g. xa-""árba xamšà bé""e} ‘four or five
eggs’ (A23:6), xa-tmánya ""6ßrà-ma°wa°a} ‘a (group of) eight or ten villages’
(B15:61), xa-""èšta šáwwa yòme} ‘a (period of) six or seven days’ (A24:48).
   Distributive expressions relating to groups of numbered items may be
formed by combining the particle kut/ku with the numeral phrase, e.g.
ku-tmánya yománe ‘every eight days’ (B7:15), kút xamšáss6r yomàne} ‘every fif-

""u-kut-šéta xa-gáya ‘once every year’ (B10:68).
   When a cardinal qualifies a definite noun, the numeral generally takes an
anticipatory suffix in constructions such as †¬á°na t-bnóne dìye} or †¬á°na bnóne
díye ‘His three sons (literally: the three of them, [of ] his sons)’ (A24:3).
   The following examples illustrate various ways in which multiples (‘x-

"16.2.1.8. Combined with other Prepositions
The preposition l- may be combined with other prepositions. After verbs
of movement, for example, it may be combined with k6s-, e.g.  (1) ""o-gáya q9m5°a °élux l-kèsli} ‘the first time you came to me’ (A1:22)16.2.2. Adpronominal Uses16.2.2.1. L-suffixes
The L-suffixes exhibit only a very restricted degree of functional overlap
with the adnominal uses of l-. The most common uses of the L-suffixes
include the expression of the subject of verb forms derived from the past
base (q†ille, q†ilwale) and the expression of the direct and indirect object
of transitive verbs.
    The use of the L-suffixes to express the subject in forms such as q†ille
originated historically as a marking of the agent in a passive construction
(< q†il ‘He was killed’ + le ‘by him’). We have seen above that adnominal
l- is still used to mark the agent of a passive. The L-suffixes have, however,
been extended to the marking of the subject of past base intransitive
verbs, where they clearly do not mark an agent. This can be explained as
a result of the suffixes being reinterpreted as markers of the grammatical
subject of the verb rather than markers of the agent.
806                            chapter sixteen   The direct object function of the L-suffixes has no parallel in the use
of the adnominal l-.
   The use of the L-suffixes to express the indirect object is restricted
for the most part to the marking of a human recipient or beneficiary.
There is no clear parallel to this in the functional range of adnominal l-,
the relation of recipient or beneficiary being normally expressed by the
prepositions ta/†la- or qa- when the complement is a nominal.
   Another use of L-suffixes, which is related to its indirect object func-
tion, is to express the possessor in possessive constructions formed with
the existential particle ""i°, e.g. ""itli k°awa ‘I have a book’. There are no
adnominal parallels to this function. When the possessor is a nominal,
this is normally placed in extraposition and is resumed by an L-suffix, e.g.
xáwri ""ítle k°áwa ‘My friend has a book’ (§17.8.1.2.).
   In general, therefore, the functional correspondence between L-suffixes
and adnominal uses of l- is considerably limited in the present state of
the language.16.2.2.2. ""6ll-
Pronominal prepositional phrases consisting of the particle ""6ll- correspond
to a wide range of the adnominal uses of l-. As with adnominal l-, the
particle ""6ll- represents the merging together of what were originally two
separate prepositions, i.e. *l- and *'al-. The functional range of ""6ll- overlaps
with those of L-suffixes and adnominal l-, but it is not completely parallel
with either of these. It may be classified into the following categories:(i) Destination  (1) ""è°yela mè†ye ""êlle.} ‘They came up to him.’ (A7:19)
  (2) mu°éla yèmme díye xa-rámša ""èlle dìye.} ‘His mother brought dinner to
      him.’ (A21:12)
  (3) zíl5le nùbl6lla} ""èlle dìye.} ‘He went and took them to him.’ (A17:12)
  (4) mam†átla ""èlla dìya.} ‘Deliver them to her.’ (A4:16)
  (5) mšádr6n m5xòlta ""èlle díye.} ‘I shall send food to him.’ (A17:11)This usage is paralleled by adnominal l- with verbs of movement (e.g. ‘to
go’, ‘to come’, ‘to arrive’), but only marginally with verbs of conveyance
(e.g. ‘to send’, ‘to take’, ‘to bring’), which normally express the destination
with ta-/†la or qa- when the complement is a nominal. Verbs of movement
do not usually express destination by L-suffixes, but L-suffixes are used
after verbs of conveyance.

   (8) t-lá-hoya qàr°-6ll6x} ‘so that you are not cold’ (A20:2)Nominal complements of verbs of speech (1)–(2) and recipients or benefi-
ciaries (3)–(4) are normally expressed by phrases containing the prepositions
ta-/†la- or qa- rather than l-. The adnominal equivalents of constructions
such as those in (5)–(8), however, generally have l-.(iii) ‘Upon, over, against’
Location over a physical object is not normally expressed with a pronomi-
nal ""6ll- phrase, although l- as an adnominal preposition is often used with
this sense. The normal means of expressing this relation with pronominal
complements is by phrases consisting of the preposition reš- ‘upon’, e.g. réša
‘on it (f.)’ (A27:17), réše dìye ‘on him’ (A31:10), b-réša ‘over them’ (A25:48),
b-rèša ‘on it’ (A12:47).
    In a few contexts a pronominal ""6ll- phrase is, nevertheless, the historical
reflex of a phrase with the preposition *'al-. These tend to be restricted
to relations of an abstract or non-physical nature, such as (1)–(7), or
constructions such as (8)–(12), which express location on the surface but
not necessarily above the item in question, often in relation to liquids
(11)–(12):   (1) šák6n ""êllux.} ‘I’ll make a complaint about you.’ (A22:46)
   (2) hótu pšàma ""èlla díya.} ‘You are sad over it.’ (A5:10)

  (12) qímle murèsle hátxa míya ""6llèy.} ‘He sprinkled water on them like this.’
       (B6:11)We could include here a construction such as (13), which expresses an
external quality:  (13) šúpr6 dúnye hóle ""6lla-dìya.} ‘She had the beauty of the world.’ (A13:11)(iv) Direct Object
Compound verbal forms consisting of a resultative particle or an infinitive
express a pronominal object either by L-suffixes or by a pronominal suffix
attached to the preposition ""6ll-. The use of the ""6ll- phrase is obligatory
when the participle or infinitive does not have a copula enclitic, e.g. hóle
q†íl6lle ‘He has killed him’, but is optional if the construction has a copula
enclitic. Details of the use of ""6ll- with the compound verbal forms are
given in §8.19.4. On rare occasions it is used to mark the pronominal
direct object of a q†ille form (§8.19.2.). It should be noted that this usage of
the prepositional phrase differs from others in that the phrase is generally
bound to the verbal form prosodically and does not stand independently
with its own stress, e.g. mútt6t6lle ‘You put him’ (A22:39), prìm6n6lla ‘I cut it
(f.)’ (A22:9), bì°6llela (bi°a-6lle-ila) ‘She loved him’ (A4:12). This is a prop-
erty it shares with L-suffixes, which likewise cannot be used with prosodic
independence from the verb. Furthermore, the adnominal preposition
l- does not function as a direct object marker.(v) Complement of verbs
Verbs that take l- as their complement before nouns have an ""6ll- phrase
when the noun is pronominalized. This phrase has prosodic indepen-
dence. Given what has been said in the previous section, this prosodic
                        the syntax of prepositions                        809feature should be regarded a reflection of the fact that they are not direct
objects, e.g.  (1)   náše là h>m6níwa ""èlle díye.} ‘People did not believe him.’ (A48:1)
  (2)   ham-mßawòre ""èlle díye.} ‘He curses him again.’ (A17:3)
                               16.3. ˇLA, TA-16.3.1. Direction
The most frequent usage of this preposition is to express the direction,
objective or beneficiary of an action or situation without necessarily any
movement being involved, e.g.  (1)  híw6lla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘They gave the pot to the mullah.’ (A5:8)
  (2)  hálla júllux †làli.} ‘Give your clothes to me.’ (A7:18)

  (4)  ""u-°élux mdagóle †làli.} ‘and you came lying to me.’ (A1:23)

  (11) málla píšla qußárta ta-màlla.} ‘The cooking pot became the mullah’s.’
       (A5:10)
  (12) †la-mò wídlux hátxa bíyi?} ‘Why (literally: for what) have you done
       this to me?’ (A15:14)16.3.2. Destination
It is occasionally used after verbs or movement or conveyance expressing
destination, e.g.
810                           chapter sixteen  (1) dè‰‰a ta-""a°rˆy.} ‘They returned to their land.’ (A4:27)
  (2) ""6n-b8y6t ""áz6t d7‰6t †la-b7°6t bàb6x} ‘If you want to go and return to
      the house of your father’ (A4:42)
  (3) ""u-náb6lla †la-be-šwàw6n.} ‘Take it to our neighbours’ house.’ (A5:3)16.3.3. Temporal Objective
The preposition may be used to express a temporal objective in construc-
tions such as (1)–(3):  (1) ""áni zílla ta-†¬à-yomane.} ‘They went for three days.’ (A14:84)
  (2) ""awwa ""askaríya dìye} †là-k6ma dán5la?} ‘For how long is this army of

  (3) píšla yóma †la-yòma,} yóma †la-yòma.} ‘She went on (like this) from day
      to day, day to day.’ (A21:1)16.3.4. Object Marker
It is occasionally used to mark the direct object (§15.13.6.). This is attested
only before definite nominals, the majority of which have animate ref-
erents, e.g.  (1) ""áwwa q†ìlle †la-""árya.} ‘He killed the lion.’ (A11:1)
  (2) díya ""áwwa b8ye ta-d-áyya bráta zùrta.} ‘Now, he loves this young girl.’

      Š6mmo.’ (B8:21)
  (4) zìpt6llela} †la-M9mo.} ‘She pushed M>mo.’ (A26:3)

ta-/†la-.","[844, 845, 846, 847, 848, 849]"
"17.4.1. Particle—Possessed Item
The item possessed is normally placed after the particle. It is typically
indefinite and bears the nuclear stress, e.g.  (1) ""ítli ðá brat6t-màma.} ‘I have a cousin.’ (A7:17)
  (2) ""ítli xákma xabráne t-amrênn6x.} ‘I have a few words to say to you.’
      (A4:40)
  (3) sab-""í°li rába mèndi †emàna gáwe díye.} ‘because I have something very
      valuable in it.’ (A7:9)
  (4) ""í°wal6n xa-màlka.} ‘We had a king.’ (A4:31)
  (5) lí°wale qußàrta.} ‘He did not have a cooking-pot.’ (A5:1)
  (6) lí°wala bnòne.} ‘They did not have children.’ (A15:9)17.4.2. Possessed Item—Particle
The possessed item is occasionally fronted before the existential particle.
The examples of this construction in the text corpus may be classified
as follows.
   (i) When the speaker wishes to draw particular attention to a newly
introduced referent in the ‘item possessed’ slot. In such cases the fronted
item bears the nuclear stress. In (2) the nominal is combined with the
particle bas, which expresses exclusivity:  (1) sa†àne ""ítl6n} gu-d-áwwa bˆ°a.} ‘We have demons in this house.’ (A22:26)
  (2) bas-yêmma ""í°wale.} ‘He had only a mother.’ (A21:3)(ii) In constructions with the positive existential particle, the possessed
item is fronted without bearing the nuclear stress when it is definite and
given in the previous discourse, e.g.
                                   the clause                                   847  (1) t-yánnux ""úpra k6mà-t b8y6t} ""u-plóx gáwe díye ""u-mápl6x nàše.} . . . ""úpra
      ""ìtli} áa¬yàn5le.} ‘ “I shall give you as much land as you want. Work
      on it and employ people.” . . . “I have land, (which) is sufficient.” ’
      (A21:41–42)(iii) In constructions with the negative existential particle, the nominal is
sometimes fronted without the nuclear stress where it is not anaphorically
linked to the preceding discourse, e.g.  (1) ""ána zúza lìtli,} f>qìrt5n.} ‘I do not have money. I am poor.’ (A22:19)17.4.3. Possessor Expressed by a Nominal
If the possessor is expressed by a nominal or independent pronominal
form, it is not made the complement of the preposition l- but rather is
extraposed at the front of the clause and resumed by an L-suffix. This
reflects the fact that the L-suffix is acquiring the properties of verbal
inflection as is the case in the q†ille form of the verb. Examples:  (1) ""aw-málka ""í°wale xa-bròna.} ‘That king had a son.’ (A4:1)
  (2) kul-má°a ""í°wala q6nyàne.} ‘Every village had domestic animals.’
      (B15:43)
  (3) sab-kúlla lì°wale táwre.} ‘because everybody did not have oxen.’
      (B5:73)On some sporadic occasions the possessor is extraposed at the end of
the clause, e.g.  (4) hóle ""í°6n bóya zòra.} ""u-""áp báxta díye hóla tàma,} ""u-""ítle ""ayàle} ""o-tèla.}
      ‘There was a small hole (in it). His wife was there also, and the fox
      had children.’ (A20:5)Constructions such as (4) with final extraposition are typically used when
the clause is presented as an elaborative tag that is cohesively connected
with what precedes. Constructions with initial extraposition such as (1)–(3),
on the other hand, express a greater disjunction from what precedes and
present the clause with more distinctness and independence.
848                          chapter seventeen                 17.5. Predications with the Verb HWYIn various contexts, which have been fully described in §15.3.9., the copula
and existential particle are replaced by a form of the verb hwy. Here we
shall restrict ourselves to some remarks concerning the word order of
predications with this verb.
  When the verb in the predicate of a main clause expresses a generic or
habitual sense, it is often placed after the other constituents, e.g.  (1) kálba gu-t8r6t màre} l6bbàna y-áwe.} ‘A dog at the door of his owner is
      brave.’ (D2:64)
  (2) lèxma prìša y-áwe.} ‘Bread is different.’ (B5:99)
  (3) ""otáxe gò‰e hawéwa.} ‘Rooms were large.’ (B10:51)
  (4) ""áw q6qwána gu-†ùra y-áwe.} ‘The partridge is in the mountains.’
      (B5:147)
  (5) ""ítl5ni halùke,} ""ap-""áni har-gu-""aqàra y-áwa.} ""ap-""áni rába basìme y-áwa.}
      ‘We have plums. These are only in the farmland. These are also
      very tasty.’ (B5:222)
  (6) xlìmta hóya.} ‘It is thick.’ (B6:49)
  (7) har-dmáxta dìy6n} biz-zóda gu-b5°wà°a hóya.} ‘Our sleeping is mainly
      in the houses.’ (B15:27)The verb is also placed before the predicate constituents when it has this
generic or habitual sense, e.g.  (8) ""ína ""áyy6t xúmßa har-xúmßa háwe xwarnàya.} ‘But the dish consisting
      only of xumßa is whitish.’ (B10:16)
  (9) qedámta hál bar-kawù°ra} šèmša y-óya bà°6r †úra,} fa-†êlla háwe} qam-†ùra.}
      ‘In the morning, until after lunch, the sun is behind the mountain
      and there is shade at the front of the mountain.’ (B3:2)The frequent posposition of the verb hwy to the end of the predicate in
generic/habitual main clauses is no doubt by analogy with the position
of the copula in main clauses. This has come about due to the semantic
proximity between this generic/habitual function of the verb and the
function of the copula.
   When used in contexts other than these generic/habitual main clauses,
the verb hwy is regularly placed before the predicate constituents, e.g.
                                 the clause                                 849  (1) háw6t hèšy6r ""ítl6n jênne.} ‘Be careful, we have jinn.’ (A22:26)
  (2) ""ána b8y6n ""aláha t-yawèlli kùl-m6ndi bi-záwda,} ta-t-xayú°i hóya spày.} ‘I
      want God to give me more of everything, so that my life will be
      good.’ (A3:3)
  (3) hézuke mòdila?} táli xàwla} b-xa-""ilána t-óya gó‰ta rába ramànta.} ‘What is
      swinging? They hang a rope on a tree that is large and very high.’
      (B6:7)
  (4) ""áw máßli xá-duk°a t-óya šaxínta y-amrèxwa gòma.} ‘They bring them
      down to a place that is warm, which we called a “basement stable.” ’
      (B5:211)A predicate constituent is put before the verb only in a few sporadic
cases, in which the speaker wishes to draw particular attention to the
constituent, e.g.  (5) kút-duk°a ""áza ""àwra} ""áp ""ayya-xéta bàra láz6m háwya.} ‘Every place that
      she goes to and enters, the other has to be (i.e. to follow) after her.’
      (B12:2)
                       17.6. Verb ‘to be’ OmittedIn some cases the verb ‘to be’, in the form of a copula, existential particle
or the verb hwy, is omitted from a clause. The majority of the attested
examples can be classified into the following categories.","[885, 886, 887, 888]"
"15.5.2. Temporally Overlapping Activity
The infinitive may be used to express an activity that was being performed
at the same time as that of the preceding verb. If the subject of the infini-
tive is the same as that of the preceding verb, the infinitive is normally
used without any pronominal subject, e.g.  (1) xa-núra ""è°y5le b-lˆle} ""ax-""áxxa sàqa.} ‘A light came in the night, coming
      up right here.’ (A29:23)
  (2) ""àw} šaqèlla gána Bakúrko ràqa,} ßàle} k6s-M9mo.} ‘He, Bakurko, took
      himself off running and went down to M>mo.’ (A26:78)
  (3) xz7g6n xòn6x} ""u-M8mo t-íla tíwe m†awóle b-s6tr6njàne.} ‘See your brother
      and M>mo who are sitting playing chess.’ (A26:64)
  (4) síqle l-bˆ°a} pšìma-w} bxáya mxáya l-gáne dìye} bnóne díye t-la-""ixàl5la.} ‘He
      went up to the house, sad, weeping, beating himself (thinking that)
      his children would be without food.’ (A22:7)

        back of a horse, riding, dressed in fine clothes, riding on the back
        of his horse, passing by.’ (A35:4)In such contexts the infinitive is generally negated by the particle t-la
‘without’, e.g.  (6)   máxe zórna xa-salíqa xèna,} ""èrbe b-dˆri,} b-g yanèy,} t-la-m>dó‰e la-š>vàna}
        ""u-la-""àp-xa.} ‘He played another tune on the pipe and the sheep
        returned, by themselves, without a shepherd driving them back or
        anybody.’ (A25:27)
  (7)   zeðàye} ""áxl6t mènna t-là-qßaya.} ‘You should eat the pittas without
        breaking them.’ (A30:5)
  (8)   ""áni xè††e huwèdi sáma zóda} ""i-z>ríla t-là maštóye.} ‘The huwedi wheat

        not yet dry, shortly before it becomes dry, they would fetch a herb
        called s6rmo.’ (B14:1)In (10), from a poetic passage, a finite verb rather than an infinitive is used
after t-la, in order to rhyme with the end of the preceding clause:  (10) xámši yóme ßimìla} qurbáne t-la qriwìla.} ‘She fasted for fifty days without
       taking communion.’ (A37:4)The infinitive construction is also used when it has a different subject
from that of the preceding verb. In such cases the subject is expressed by
a nominal or independent pronoun, e.g.  (11) xèzy6lla náše jêmye} qúrb6t qáßr6t màlka,} kút-xa mßawó°e xà-m6ndi,} kút-
       xa mára xà-m6ndi.} ‘He saw the people gathered near the palace of
       the king, each one saying something, each one telling something.’

       old woman) went up (to see her). She (the princess) is continually
       acting madly, leaping and jumping around naked in the rooms.’
       (A4:17)
                             the syntax of verbs                              729  (13) w-ána q6m-maxˆli} w-áti xyára bìyi.} ‘They beat me while you were
       looking at me.’ (A2:10)Again, the infinitive is generally negated by the particle t-la ‘without’,
e.g.  (14) qím5le jálde madènxa t-la-mxàya.} ‘He rose early while the dawn was
       not breaking (= before dawn broke).’ (A8:51)We have seen that also the infinitive with the deictic copula can be used to
express an event that overlaps temporally with that of an adjacent clause
(§15.4.2.3.). In principle this expresses a greater degree of independent
duration. The infinitives in the foregoing examples, by contrast, are typi-
cally more closely knit with the activities expressed by the adjacent verbs
with a lesser degree of independent duration.
   In the foregoing examples the infinitive supplies a further description of
the event. In some cases the infinitive may have an epexegetical relationship
to a preceding clause, in that it supplies further explanatory information
that is necessary for its interpretation. This applies to the following:  (15) ""ána wídli spayù°a,} maxzóy6llux dàwa.} ‘I did a kindness by showing
       you the gold.’ (A10:12)
  (16) ""áwwa mò-t>h6r náš5le?} là-""amr6tti?} zála škáya ""êlli?} ‘What kind of
       person is he (’ixalo)—won’t you tell me?—going complaining
       about me?’ (A25:31)
  (17) qa-mòt hátxa wáða bíyi,} m5°óye dwáq6lla ""ùrxi?} ‘Why have you done
       this to me, bringing (snow) and blocking my road?’ (A25:42)An infinitive may be used in a clause preceding the main clause, express-
ing an activity or situation that was in existence when the event of the
main clause took place, e.g.  (18) ""ánna kút-dan6t jrà†a,} suráye dwaqêlla.} ‘Each time they slip, the Chris-
       tians grab them.’ (B19:7)
  (19) ""áni xyàpa,} zíl5le yàwna} zdí°6lle l5ka-S6ttìye.} ‘While they were bathing,
       the dove went and threw it by S6ttiye.’ (A25:72)
  (20) ""áxni plá†a gu-bˆ°a,} b8y6x †8y6x xá-m6ndi t-àxl6x,} hóla xzáy6ll6n qá†u
       ráqa bá°r6n xàl6ll5ni.} ‘(When) we go out into the house and search
       for something to eat, the cat sees us, runs after us and eats us.’
       (A44:1)
730                             chapter fifteen  (21) š-lá-praqa ""o-pék dìye} ""o-xáwri hád6x gabbàra,} xáz6x wírre gawàye.} ‘(While)
       my friend, who was a huge man, had not yet finished his measure
       (of whiskey), we saw him go inside.’ (B15:58)Also in these contexts an infinitive with a deictic copula may be used.
The difference again is that the copula makes the clause less tightly knit
with the adjacent clause and presents it as having a greater degree of
independent duration.","[766, 767, 768, 769]"
"  (3) A: ""7k5le gêrðo?} B: hón xíl6lle gêrðo.} ‘A: “Where is the stew?” B: “I
      have eaten the stew.” ’
662                           chapter fifteen  (4)   A: ""7k5le gêrðo?} B: xílli gêrðo.} ‘A: “Where is the stew?” B: “I have
        eaten the stew.” ’The difference between these is as follows. The resultative construction in
(3) asserts a present state that is disconnected temporally from the event that
caused it, so the event must have happened at some time in the past that
is not adjacent to the present moment, e.g. several hours ago or yesterday.
The q†ille form would be used as in (4) when the endpoint of the past event
is adjacent to the present, i.e. I have just now eaten it, where a translation
with the English perfect of recent past would be appropriate.
   The indeterminateness of the event signified by the resultative form
means that the individual referents of plural nouns or nouns of mass in
the clause can be interpreted as being distributed over more than one
event during a particular duration of time, e.g.  (5)   ""èdyo hón xíla rába xabùše.} ‘Today I have eaten many apples.’
  (6)   ""èdyo hóla ""è°ye rába nàše.} ‘Today many people have come.’
  (7)   ""èdyo hón xíla lêxma.} ‘Today I have eaten bread.’Example (5), with a plural patient argument ‘apples’, can be interpreted as
meaning that during the course of today up to the present moment there
have been various occasions on which I have eaten apples. The consump-
tion of ‘many apples’ may have been distributed over various events, with
a few apples being eaten on each occasion. It could also be interpreted
as denoting the result of a single event of apple eating. Likewise example
(6), which has a plural subject argument, can be interpreted as meaning
either that the ‘many people’ came separately in a series of discrete events
or that they arrived together. The construction reports only that ‘many
people’ are in the resultant state of ‘having come’, without denoting that
this was the result of one or of a series of events. The interpretation of
(7), which has a noun of mass ‘bread’ as an object argument, could be
that I have eaten some bread on various occasions today or on only one
occasion. Contrast this with the equivalent clauses with q†ille forms:  (8) ""èdyo xílli rába xabùše.} ‘Today I ate many apples.’
  (9) ""èdyo °éla rába nàše.} ‘Today many people came.’
  (10) ""èdyo xílli lêxma.} ‘Today I ate bread.’The q†ille form denotes a specific event and (8)–(10) must be interpreted
as referring to single events. The adverbial ""6dyo ‘today’ would normally
                              the syntax of verbs                                 663force the interpretation that the endpoint of these events occurred before
the present moment and so they must be translated with the English
preterite.
   In some circumstances the context indicates the specific event that
caused the present result. If, for example, the clause contains a punctual
time adverbial binding the event to a particular point in time with no
duration, the event is fully specified. Clauses containing the resultative
form combined with such time adverbials, therefore, assert the existence
of a present state and the context signals that it has been caused by this
specific event. These would still differ from corresponding clauses with the
q†ille form, which assert the occurrence of the event but the existence of a
present state is only a possible implicature, which may be cancelled. Note
that in English the present perfect is not used when the clause contains
such time adverbials, e.g.  (11) xóni hóle ""è°ya ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""èóóa-w pàlge.} ‘My brother came today at
       half past nine.’
  (12) xóni °éle ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""èóóa-w pàlge.} ‘My brother came today at half
       past nine.’The construction (11) with the resultative form asserts that my brother is
currently in the state of ‘having come’ and so would be the natural con-
struction to use if he is still here. Construction (12) could be interpreted
as implying that he is still here, but this implicature could be cancelled
and the form would still be felicitous (13). Any corresponding denial of
the existence of the present result with the resultative construction would
not be felicitous (14), e.g.  (13) xóni °éle ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""êóóa,} bás plí†le bá°6r pàlg6t-sa""6t.} ‘My brother
       came today at nine o’clock, but left after half an hour.’
  (14) ?? xóni hóle ""è°ya ""èdyo b-sá""6t ""êóóa,} bás hóle plí†a bá°6r pàlg6t-sa""6t.} ‘My
       brother came today at nine o’clock, but left after half an hour.’The functional features of the resultative that have been described above
are also discernible in its negated form l5le q†ila. The negative form l5le
""6°ya ‘He has not come’ can be analysed as meaning that he is currently
not in a state of ‘having come’. Thus no specific event is negated. The
implication is that no event of coming has occurred at any time. The
negative la q†ille form, on the other hand, negates the occurrence of a spe-
cific event in the recent past. The event has its specificity and definiteness
664                            chapter fifteenby being bound to a particular point in time in the discourse context.
Consider (15):  (15) lat-nxàpa!?} xá ""axwá°i mìra} dráya šlámi ""êllux} ""u-""áti tíwa l-†ìzux!} lèmo
       la-qìmlux?} ‘Are you not ashamed!? A prince like me greets you and
       you sit on your bum. Why did you not get up?’ (A26:48)Here the question with the negated q†ille form la-qìmlux is intended to
ask why the addressee did not get up specifically at the time that the
speaker greeted him. The translation of such negated q†ille forms by the
English perfect of recent past is appropriate in a context where an event
was expected to occur and the endpoint of its occurrence was expected
to be adjacent with the present. If somebody is expected to arrive at a
house at a particular time, somebody in the house may say °èle? ‘Has he
come?’ The response to this could be là °éle ‘He has not come’, which
would deny that he has come at this expected specific point in time in
the recent past, with no necessary implication that he will come in the
future. After uttering this, it would be appropriate to assert an action that
is sequential to this specific point in time, e.g. là °éle.} ""àz6x.} ‘He has not
come. Let’s go’. The negated q†ille form là-°ela in (16) from the text corpus
should be interpreted in this way:  (16) xéna ""ána q7m6n ""áz6n ""ùmra,} ""ánna xon>wá°a là-°ela.} ‘Well, I shall
       go to church. These brothers have not come back (now when I
       expected them to come).’ (A37:2)Note also (17), in which the absence of expectation that the man will
come in the future is made explicit:  (17) xóni zílle ""u-lá °èle.} ""u-díya ""ána hon-xšáwa leš-""à°e.} ‘My brother has
       gone and has not come back, and now I think he will no longer
       come back.’ (A8:60)The negated q†ille form can be combined with the temporal adverbial par-
ticles referring to the present moment, such as heš ‘still’ and hal-diya ‘until
now’. These underscore that the action that is negated was expected to
happen at a point in the immediate past adjacent to the present moment,
e.g. heš-là °éle,} ""àz6x!; hal-díya là °éle,} ""àz6x!} These could be paraphrased:
We have waited for him until the present moment, when he was expected
to come, but he has not come at the expected time, so now let’s go.
                              the syntax of verbs                               665   It would not be appropriate to use the negated q†ille form là °éle if
there is still an expectation that the person will come. If there is such an
expectation the negated resultative form l5le ""6°ya would be used. The lat-
ter form asserts that he is currently not in a state of ‘having come’ but it
does not assert that this state is permanent. This is because, as remarked
in §15.3.7., the negative copula does not specify the permanency of the
state. It may denote either a permanent or a contingent state. The form
l5le ""6°ya, therefore, could be used if the speaker expects this state to be
temporary and assumes he will come at some point in the future. If the
construction is combined with the particle heš ‘still, yet’ (e.g. heš l5le ""6°ya ‘He
has not yet come’), the scope of the assertion is narrowed to the present
moment, i.e. at the present moment he is not in a state of ‘having come’,
which implies that he may come at some point in the future.
   Since a negative resultative such as l5le ""6°ya ‘He has not come’ has
generic temporal reference (‘at no time in the past’), it is normal to use
this construction with negative generic time adverbials such as ‘u-ga
‘never’, e.g.  (18) ‘ú-ga l7le ""ê°ya.} ‘He has never come.’
  (19) ‘ú-ga lát xêzy6lle?} ‘Have you not ever seen him?’In what follows we shall present various examples from direct speech in
the text corpus that contain resultative forms and q†ille/q6m-qa†6l forms that
should be translated by the English present perfect. The reasons that led
the speaker to choose one form rather than the other will be examined
in the light of the foregoing discussion.  (20) síg6n ""áti b7°i muxrùlux!} . . . mèra hàtx6t wíða?} mèra hot-ß†ìm6lle

forms all have the deictic copula, which draws the hearer’s attention to
a resultant state. In some cases, however, the enclitic copula is used in
assertions. This generally occurs in contexts where the assertion is for some
reason less informative. In many cases the enclitic copula is used when
the speaker wishes to give greater relative prominence to the contents of
an adjacent clause and so reduces the attention drawn to the clause with
the resultative construction. In (31) the speaker wishes to draw attention to
the purpose of her coming, expressed in the following dependent clause,
more than the fact that she has come. This applies also to the reply of her
interlocutor, in which the resultative also has an enclitic copula. Example
(32) exhibits a similar construction, in which the purpose clause is more
informative than the main verb:  (31) ""áy jal-jálde wírra ""èlle dìye} mèra lá-dri x7l6t gànux.} ""ána °í°6n mpal†ánnux

668                            chapter fifteenIn (33) and (34), likewise, the speaker wishes to give less prominence to
the main verbs than to the content of their complement clauses:  (33) mèra xzí°6n b-xêlmi} xóni dàw6qlux} darélux gu-s6ndàna,} gu-hàbsa.}
       ‘She said “I have seen in my dream that my brother will seize you

       many men in the world may come after me I shall not go to any
       man. But, if a woman comes to take me to anyone she wants, or
       to her brother, I shall go.’ (A8:78)In (35) the main prominence is put on the circumstantial clause, which
expresses a new tragic realization, rather than on the resultative verbs ‘I
have fallen in love with you’ and ‘I have followed you’, which are presup-
posed facts:  (35) mèra ""ána bí°6nnux °í°6n bà°rux} w-ana-l7ð6n t-awètwa ""áti xày6n
       pal†ètwa mènni.} ‘She said “I have fallen in love with you and followed
       you, while not knowing that you would turn out to be treacherous
       to me.” ’ (A14:101)In (36) and (37) the lack of a deictic copula in the second clause reflects
the fact that these function as elaborations of the previous clause, rather
than prominent pieces of independent information:  (36) ""àna} hon-""ê°ya,} ríq6n qam-màmi.} ‘I have come, running away from
       my paternal uncle.’ (A25:42)
  (37) b-óma xéna ""á°eti †la-kawù°ra,} ‘íd6t k6slˆni.} ‘The day after tomorrow
       come to lunch, you are invited to our home.’ (A22:14)A different reason for a reduced level of informativeness of the resultative
construction is illustrated by (38). Here the clause ‘I have put the house
in order’ refers to an activity that the speaker performs every day and so
would be expected to perform:  (38) ""ám6r hà yèmmi} mùt mára?} ""ˆnile plíxa ""èdyo?} mèra bábi har-""àtit plíxa,}
       ""u-xmára-w tàwra,} ""u-""ána mquzqázt6n bˆ°a.} ‘He said “So, mother,

In the narrative sections of folktales in the text corpus the resultative form
is frequently used with the function of a preterite to relate a specific punc-
tual event in the past without any assertion of the existence of a resultant
state in the present. When it has this function, it is normally used with
the enclitic copula rather than the deictic copula. Since in narrative it
denotes a punctual event rather than a durable resultant state, it may be
used to express a chain of sequential events, e.g.  (1) qìmela} b-lèle} †ríp6lla Zìne} ""u-mù°y6lla,} núbl6lla k6s-M9mo.} núbl6lla k6s-
      M9mo.} dmìxela.} ‰ìšt5la,} zìpt6llela} †la-M9mo.} ‘At night they went and
      seized Zine and brought her, they took her to M>mo. They took
      her to M>mo. They slept. She woke up and pushed M>mo (out of
      bed). (A26:3)

      Te≥din. He pulled it from the grass he was eating and tied his own
      in its place, then went up. He went up and knocked on the door.’
      (A26:29)

      núbl6lla zèdy6lla gu-ða-xèta.} ‘They took the bowl in the night, took it
      away and threw it into a house enclosure. They took it from that
      enclosure, took it away and threw it into another one.’ (A15:12)
  (4) ""áp-""awwa sìq5le gu-†úra,} m6n-xuráne díye píš5le gu-†úra xá-yoma yóme trè.}
      dmìxela} b-lˆle xá-ga} ""è°yela tré malàxe.} ‘So, he went up into the moun-
      tains with his friends and remained in the mountains one or two
      days. One night they went to sleep and two angels came.’ (A4:2)The copula is sometimes omitted from the participle when it has this
narrative preterite function. This typically occurs in a series of clauses
that open with a verb with the copula. The clause or clauses without the
copula express events that are closely sequential to that of the opening
clause. The purpose of the speaker is to present these as components of
one overall event rather than as a series of discrete events. The initial
verb in the chain is often a verb of movement or the verb qym ‘to arise’,
which in narrative frequently loses its original meaning and is used simply
to mark the onset of a new event, e.g.
670                             chapter fifteen  (5)   ""è°yela jmìye.} ‘They came and gathered together.’ (A22:2)
  (6)   ""è°y5le wìra.} ‘He came and entered.’ (A26:47)
  (7)   qím5le ""è°ya síqa l-gàre.} ‘He got up, came and went up onto the
        roof.’ (A26:40)
  (8)   qím5le mú°ya tùre.} ‘He got up and fetched twigs.’ (A20:3)
  (9)   ""ay-qìmt5la,} wíðta qàwa.} ‘She got up and made coffee.’ (A26:31)Normally in such chains of events the clause with the participle without
the copula has the same subject as the preceding clause, as is the case
in the examples above. When there is a change in subject a copula is
generally used, e.g.  (10) síq5le mèxya l-t9ra} ""u-plí††5la S6ttìye.} ‘He went up and knocked on
       the door and S6ttiye came out.’ (A26:29)
  (11) ""è°y5le tíwa b-dìw6n} ""u-náše kúlla tìwela} gu-dìw6n.} ‘He came and sat
       down in the reception room, and everybody else sat down in the
       reception room.’ (A26:63)These are not, however, absolute rules. The copula is occasionally omitted
when there is a change of subject in a chain of events (12) and even in
the first clause in a narrative sequence after direct speech (13)–(14):  (12) ""u-sìq5le} súse kèlya tàma.} ‘He went up and his horse stopped there.’
       (A26:28)
  (13) mèra m5°ítule kêsli!} mú°ye Bakúrko kèsla dìya.} ‘She said “Bring him
       to me”. They brought Bakurko to her.’ (A26:84)
  (14) ""o-náša sàwa} mère †la-d-ó-yala zòra,} mêre} ""ˆka t-áz6t?} ""ána ‘ú-duk°a lìtli.}
       t-áz6n gu-jàma.} xám6n gu-jàma.} ""áwwa qíma zíla l-bˆ°e díye} ""o-náša gò‰a.}
       ‘The old man said to the youth, he said “Where will you go?” “I
       have nowhere to go. I’ll go to the mosque. I’ll stay in the mosque.”
       The elderly man got up and went to his house.’ (A17:5–6)In the case of a sequence of two verbs that are closely related and pre-
sented as a tightly knit unit in the same intonation group, the copula is
sometimes put only on the second participle of the sequence. This is
most often found where the first verb of the sequence expresses move-
ment, e.g.  (15) ""áwwa gáw‰a díya síq5le l-Nìnwe,} dí‰a ""ê°y5le.} ‘Her husband went up
       to Nineveh, then returned and came back.’ (A13:2)

  (18) qlíba ßêly5le.} ‘He went back down.’ (A30:32)
  (19) dmíxe-u †lìyela.} ‘They lay down and slept.’ (A4:50)In narratives the preterite q†il5le form is used interchangeably with the
q†ille/q6m-qa†6l form, which is the other main narrative verb form. The
narrator constantly shifts from one form to the other. These shifts often
coincide with some kind of reorientation in the narrative, especially where
there is a change in subject and the narrator directs attention to another
character, e.g.  (20) qím5le lˆle šètya qáwa.} tíw5le l-xáß6 súse dìye} ""u-dí‰5le ßèly5le r6š-d-ˆ-""5na.}
       ""5-""7na t-ìle ""è°ya qamáye réša.} Qára Té≥din dì‰‰e} °éle bˆ°a} ""ám6r hà}
       báxta k7le ""àrxa?} ‘He got up and did not drink the coffee. He sat
       on the back of his horse and went back down to the spring, the
       spring to which he had come previously. Qara Te≥din returned
       home and said “Ah, wife, where is the guest?” ’ (A26:32–33)
  (21) síq5le l-gàre} maxzóy6lle Jazíra Bòta.} Zìne} ""u-""án-xaddamyá°a díya ßléla
       r6š-""ˆna.} ‘He went up onto the roof to show him Jazira Bota. Zine
       and her maid-servants went down to the spring.’ (A26:40)
  (22) ""ê°y5le,} qam-t8r6t b7°a tíw5le hàd6x.} bábe díye °èle.} ‘He came and
       sat down in front of the door of the house. His father came.’
       (A26:10)
  (23) Qára Té≥din zìl5le,} yíw6lla ""íðe gu-""íð6t M9mo.} M8mo q6m-šaqèlla ßoßiyá°6t
       Zìne} mattúla gu-""íð6t Qára Tè≥din.} ‘Qara Te≥din went and put his
       hand in the hand of M>mo. M>mo took the locks of Zine and
       put them in the hand of Qara Te≥din.’ (A26:50)On some occasions there is no change in subject across the transition
from one verbal form to the other. In such cases some kind of reorienta-
tion on another dimension of the discourse can usually be discerned. In
(24), for example, the shift from q†il5le for q†ille coincides with the start of
a chain of clauses that narrate a new event, i.e. the eating of the third
fox cub. In (25) the clause ‘In this way they held the wedding’ contain-
ing the q†ille form wídla is not presented as an event that is sequential to
the previously mentioned events of ‘bringing them up with drum and
pipe’ and ‘firing rifles’ but rather it recapitulates these preceding specific
672                               chapter fifteenevents by a general statement. In (26) the section beginning ‘They played
three times and Mir-Zandin lost’, which contains q†ille forms, may also
be regarded as constituting a break in the tight chain of events of the
previous clauses. Its function is to elaborate on the event of playing chess
rather than to carry the discourse forward with new events. In a similar
manner the clause with the resultative form in (27) elaborates on the
preceding clause with the q†ille form:  (24) qímela ""ap-""o-tré prìm6lle,} xìl6lle.} ""ím6t xílla ""ap-""o-trè,} píšla xà-šab°a,} tré
       šabbà°a,} kpìnna.} ""áp-""o-†¬a°a q6m-p5rmìle.} ‘They slaughtered also the
       second one and ate him. After they ate the second one, a week,
       two weeks went by, they became hungry and slaughtered also the

  (25) qímela músq6lla b-dáwla-w zòrna,} dr7°6t tòpe.} ""u-hád6x wídla xlùla.} ‘They
       brought them up (to the palace) with drum and pipe and the firing
       of rifles. In this way they held the wedding.’ (A4:56)
  (26) qìm5le} qèry5le qa-M9mo,} ""è°y5le tíwa b-dìw6n} ""u-náše kúlla tìwela} gu-
       dìw6n.} šúryela m†awóle b-š6tr6njàne.} †¬á-gaye m†uwêlla,} ríqle Mir-Zàndin.}
       lá-mßele b-M9mo.} ‘Now, he called for M>mo and he came and sat
       in the reception room, and everybody else sat down in the recep-
       tion room. They began playing chess. They played three times
       and Mir-Zandin lost (literally: ran away) and was unable to beat

  (27) wírre gu-bòye.} gu-bóye díye m†úšy6lla gáne dìye.} ‘He went into his hole.
       He hid himself in his hole’ (A1:15)The transition in the narrative between the two verbal forms is also
attested where the narrator repeats the mention of an event of particular
importance in the story. The shift of verbal form is no doubt exploited
in such circumstances to mark off the repeated clause more sharply from
what precedes in order to give it prominence, e.g.  (28) ""ó-yom6 t-íle plí†a málka m-bˆ°a,} ""ó-yoma bróne díye mì°5le.} ""ó-yoma mìtle
       bróne díye.} ‘On the day that the king left home, on that day his son

  (29) ""áyya ""aqèrwa °ì°a} gu-réš6 d-o-bòya} q†ìlt6lle.} q6m-qa†lále ""o-xùwwe.} ‘The

       the snake.’ (A9:6)
  (30) ""áwwa zdìl5le.} zdìlle,} mère . . . } ‘He became afraid. He became afraid
       and said . . .’ (A21:33)
                            the syntax of verbs                             673Certain verbs exhibit a clear tendency to have the preterite expressed by
q†ille rather than the resultative in narrative. A common feature of this
set of verbs is that they are typically matrix verbs that have a clause as
their complement. The most conspicuous of these verbs is ""mr ‘to say’.
When this introduces direct speech, which may be considered to be its
complement, the verb is regularly in the q†ille form: mère ‘He said’, mèra
‘She said’, etc. Other matrix verbs that are generally put in the q†ille form
when preterite in narratives include:m-šry ‘to begin’:  (31) mšuréla bxàya.} ‘She began to weep.’ (A4:42)
  (32) šuréla ßràxa.} ‘She began to shout.’ (A25:82)ßbr ‘to dare’:  (33) lá ßbírra mßuwêtla.} ‘She did not dare to speak.’ (A24:40)
  (34) ""áp-xa mènna lá-ßbirre rhíwle gu-dìw6n.} ‘Nobody dared speak to him
       in the reception room.’ (A26:70)mßy ‘to be able’:  (35) lá-mßela mßuwêtla.} ‘She could not speak.’ (A21:26)
  (36) ""áyya bàxta} lá-mßela mxumˆla ""èrwe.} ‘The woman could not keep the
       sheep.’ (A10:6)kaze ‘to attempt without success’:  (37) kízle mxàya} goyá°6t sùsa,} súsa la-jwìjle.} ‘He tried to strike the sides
       of the horse, but the horse did not move.’ (A28:33)
  (38) kízle mparpóle bìye:} nàša,} ""ánna xon>wà°ila.} ‘He tried (to dissuade
       him) by begging him “Man, these are my brothers.” ’ (A12:10)
  (39) kízla bróni lá-wuð hátxa mêndi.} ‘She tried (to stop him by saying)
       “Son, don’t do such a thing.” ’ (A14:6)
  (40) kízle d6-mxíli xa-xèna!} ‘He tried (to persuade him by saying) “Strike
       me again!” ’ (A52:24)The deictic copula is sometimes used with the resultative participle in
narratives. In such cases the form has its usual non-narrative function of
denoting a resultant state. It is generally used to present the background
674                             chapter fifteento the main narrative line against which the punctual narrative events
occurred. The deictic copula here takes the past time reference of the
surrounding context. It is often appropriate to translate such background
clauses with the English pluperfect. Examples:  (41) ""u-d6ryále gàne} gu-bêrke,} sxày5le.} súse díye hóle mrúpy6lle gu-màrga.}

       angel) said “Bless your father and mother. May each live another
       fifty years.” The angels got up and returned.’ (A4:57–60)Occasionally the deictic copula is used when the construction expresses
a punctual event that is sequential to what precedes. The effect of this is
to draw particular attention to the event and mark it off distinctly from
what precedes. In (48) the main motivation appears to be to give particular
attention to the event due to its unexpectedness. It is not usual for a barber
to have to bring a ladder to cut a person’s hair. In (49) the deictic copula
is used to mark the onset of a section narrating a battle between the hero
and his enemy. The section begins with the narrative formula mara ‘(The
story) says’, which is generally used as a device to mark boundaries in the
discourse (§15.4.2.3 examples 19–23).  (48) tíw5le Zàlo} q6m-t8r6t qáßre dìye} ""o-˙allàqa} hóle mú°y6lla xa-semàlta}

       also him. He and that man fought. They continued fighting until
       dawn. At dawn, the break of day, he disappeared.’ (A12:10)The use of the q†il5le construction in narratives to express sequential
events in the past seems prima facie to be unusual. It is unlikely that the
normal function of q†il5le to express present resultant states has been
here exploited to give vividness to past events. More effective means of
expressing such vividness are available to the narrator in the q†ille form,
which expresses events in the immediate past, or the perfective qa†6l,
which expresses punctual events taking place in the present moment.
The resultant states expressed by the present perfect q†il5le, moreover,
are temporally unbounded and would more naturally be used to express
temporally overlapping states rather than be concatenated to express
sequential situations.
676                           chapter fifteen   A more satisfactory explanation is to regard this function of the q†il5le
form in narratives to have originated in the use of the present perfect as
an evidential verbal form. In many languages present perfect verb forms
have developed the function of expressing past events for which the speaker
has no direct evidence. Such forms are used when the speaker has not
witnessed the event first hand, but has acquired knowledge of the event
only by hearsay report or by inference from indirect evidence. The pro-
pensity of the present perfect to develop this function in languages is due
to the fact that it does not present an event directly but only through its
results (Comrie 1976: 108–110; Aikhenvald 2004: 112–115). The stimulus
for the C. Barwar NENA present perfect to have its function extended in
this way was probably given by language contact. A likely candidate for
the source of this influence is Turkish. This language has an evidential
verbal form (distinguished by the affix -mi{), which is associated mor-
phologically and functionally with the perfect. A relevant feature of the
Turkish evidential form is that it is used in fictional narratives with no
basis in reality, such as myths and folktales (Slobin and Aksu 1982; Aksu
and Slobin 1986; Aksu-Koç 1988: 25), which are the type of narrative
text where the q†il5le preterite is most often encountered in the C. Barwar
dialect. A perfect verb form extended to express the evidential denotes
perfective events rather than present states and so can be used felicitously
to express sequential narrative events.
   It should be noted, however, that in the C. Barwar NENA dialect, it
appears that the q†il5le perfect form is not used with an evidential func-
tion outside of narrative contexts. In contexts that would typically trigger
an evidential form, informants use both q†ille and q†il5le with their usual
distinction in temporal-aspectual function, e.g.  (50) már5le xóni ""è°y5le qedàmta.} ‘He says that my brother came this
       morning.’
  (51) mabyónela xóni ""è°y5le qedàmta.} ‘It seems that my brother came this
       morning.’
  (52) már5le xóni dìya °éle.} ‘He says that my brother has just come.’
  (53) mabyónela xóni dìya °éle.} ‘It seems that my brother has just come.’Furthermore speakers use 1st person q†il5le forms in narratives. This is
difficult to reconcile with an evidential function, which is characteristically
used when a speaker has indirect evidence of an event in which he/she
has not participated, e.g.

       It turned itself round. I thought it would not strike me. It turned
       itself round . . . It gave me a kick.’ (B5:131–132)In the light of the foregoing, it is easiest to regard the q†il5le preterite as a
narrative verbal form, characteristic of fictitious discourse, which originally
developed in imitation of the use of the Turkish evidential verbal forms
with -mi{ in fictitious narrative. It did not, however, come to be used as a
fully functional evidential form that could be used outside of narrative.","[700, 701, 702, 703, 704, 705, 706, 707, 708, 709, 710, 711, 712, 713, 714, 715, 716]"
"15.1.2.2. Past Habitual (Realis)
The qa†6lwa form is occasionally used with class A verbs to refer to habitual
actions in the past, expressing an imperfective aspect in the past indicative,
though in the majority of cases the past habitual of this class of verb is
expressed by the ""i-qa†6lwa form with the ""i- prefix. Examples from the text
corpus in main and subordinate clauses include the following:  (1) kút-yum ""azáwa l-†úra ma°yáwa ða-k7rt6 q7sa l-xáßa dìya.} ‘Everyday she
      would go to the mountains and bring a bundle of wood on her
      back.’ (A10:6)
  (2) tÆtun-≥ig6n} z>rìwala} ""ánna xaqlà°a} z>ríwala kùlla.} ""awðíwala zrùta.}
      ‘They would cultivate tobacco. They would plough all the fields
      and make them into ploughed land.’ (B7:10)
  (3) ""as‰íwala dàsta.} ‘They would bind it (the tobacco) in bundles.’
      (B7:16)
  (4) m6n-""6mmày6t šènne} duxrán6t Mar-Sáw6t ""oðìwale} ""íwa t6ltáss6r b-""êóóa.} ‘For

      was on the thirteenth of September.’ (B15:92)
  (5) ""ína bušála t-""oðèxwala †làl6n,} xán‘i miyànta,} la-ràba.} ‘But the stew,
      which we made for ourselves, was somewhat watery, though not
      too much.’ (B10:17)

to express past habitual action, e.g.  (7)  bašlíwa rêzza.} bašlíwa šòrba.} ‘They would cook rice. They would
       cook soup.’ (B7:3)
  (8) q5míwa m†alìwa,} raqðìwa,} zamrìwa.} ‘They would get up and play,
       dance and sing.’ (B7:4)
  (9) ""an-šêdle} šalxìwala m6n-táma} max7wala gu-m6ššàra.} ‘They would uproot
       the seedlings from that place and plant them in the paddy field.’

  (10) béna halbát m5°7wa štˆ°a-w,} yá'ni ""9raq,} ""u-m-xàmra-w} zamrìwa-w}

       with wine, and they would sing and enjoy themselves.’ (B5:62)
  (11) kút-xa šáq6lwa xákma x6zmàn-dìye,} masèqla k6sle-díye †la-f†àrta.} ‘Each
       person would take some of his relatives and take them up to his
       home for breakfast.’ (B5:60)The form may be used also to express iterative action that took place over
a short interval of time, e.g.  (12) mère ""ána b8y6n S6ttìye.} ""áy biš-šapìrt5la S6ttíye} ""u-d5réwa képe hátxa biyˆni.}
       ‘He said “I love S6ttiye. S6ttiye is the most beautiful” and threw
       stones (repeatedly) at us.’ (A25:20)
  (13) xà-gaya,} daríwa xà-f6lsa.} ""5néy yawíwala l-†ùra} ""u-xaßéy ""6l-gàrra.} ‘On
       one occcasion they were throwing a coin (repeatedly). They turned
       their eyes to the mountain and their backs to the pool.’ (B15:33)15.1.2.3. Continuous Situation in the Past
We have seen in §15.1.1.4. that a small set of verbs denoting mental
processes or states are used in the qa†6l form to express a situation that
holds in the actual present but is not necessarily a habitual property of
the subject. When such verbs are used in the qa†6lwa form, they may
denote, accordingly, a continuous situation at a particular period in the
past rather than a habitual property of the subject, e.g.  (1)   ""u-b>yéwa palè†-u plì†le.} ‘He wanted to come out and he came out’
        (A22:45)
  (2)   ""ap-q†ála b>yènwa qa†lênwale.} ‘I even wanted to to kill him.’ (A1:17)
  (3)   ""áyya ’6lk8ze B8dal Sahàre} y>ðàwa} ""áwwa hóle °àya.} ‘This ’6lk>ze
        B>dal Sahare knew that he was coming.’ (A12:33)
588                            chapter fifteenThe qa†6lwa form is used with these verbs also to express a habitual situ-
ation, e.g.  (4) ""u-mdi b>yêxwa} zaqrèxwa ""àxni.} ‘Whatever we wanted we used to knit.’
      (B10:46)
  (5) y>ðíwa mo-qádra d5rˆwa.} ‘They knew how much (soil) to put on.’
      (B5:191)15.1.2.4. Conditional Constructions
The qa†6lwa form is used in the protasis of conditional constructions.
These may refer to real iterative situations in the past (1–3). Alternatively,
the qa†6lwa form may be used to refer to a hypothetical condition in the
past, which was not fulfilled, or to a hypothetical condition in the pres-
ent or future, which the speaker assesses to be impossible to fulfil (4–6).
Such hypothetical conditions refer to a single event or an iterative event.
The verb can be interpreted as expressing perfective aspect, presenting
the action as an event delimited by a start and end point, or at least with
a start point. In the case of iterative actions, the speaker uses the form
that is appropriate to express each individual perfective occurrence of
the iterated situation. Verbs expressing mental processes and states such
as by ‘to want’ in (3) are exceptions. In main clauses the qa†6lwa form of
these verbs are used imperfectively to express a continous situation in the
past and this applies also to their usage in the syntactic context under
discussion here. Examples:  (1) ""u-""6n-xà‘‘a} xá‘‘a xa-béna ""aryàwa-dunye} d5r7wa xá‘‘a tùna,} biš-dawùqwa.}
      ‘If it rained, they put down a little straw, so that it was more com-
      pact.’ (B5:146)
  (2) ""6n-parèqwa ""Èšwu†,} ""áw ""6srí-tmanya yomá°a yan-""6srí-""6óóa yomàn5le,}
      y-azèxwa †ùra.} ‘If February was finished—it is twenty-eight or twenty-
      nine days long—we would go to the mountains.’ (B5:152)
  (3) ""6n-b>yèxwa tùma,} †la-mbašàlta,} kèf6n-ile.} ‘If we wanted (to use) garlic
      for cooking, it was up to us.’ (B10:24)
  (4) ""6n-maxéwala xa-xéna xa°màwa} t-axlàwale.} ‘If he had hit another (blow),
      she would have healed and eaten him.’ (A50:14)
  (5) ""6n-maßéwa t-axêlwala,} lˆla xamúße.} ‘If he could have eaten them, (he
      would not have said that) they were sour.’ (A43:4)
  (6) ""6n-maßênwa,} t-a°ênwa.} ‘If I could, I would come.’
                            the syntax of verbs                           589Note the usage of the qa†6lwa form to refer to a hypothetical perfective
event in the past that did not actually take place in contexts such as (7)–(10)
or a hypothetical condition in the future, which the speaker assesses to be
unlikely to take place (11)–(12):  (7)  ""ó-yom6t gorànwa,} ""è°y5le ""áwwa 'afr≈t gnìw6lli.} ‘The day I would have
       got married, this demon came and stole me away.’ (A13:14)
  (8) ""ap-""àti} m-g¶b t-a°ètwa m7°6twali zùze,} šqíllux xa-š6ndòxa.} ‘So you,
       instead of coming and bringing me money, took a rock.’ (A1:25)
  (9) m-7ka †>yênwalux ""ána?} ‘From where could I have sought this for
       you?’ (A30:23)
  (10) †úwe t-xazênwale!} ‘If only I had seen him!’
  (11) bas-xá°i Nozáli xazênwala.} ‘If only I could see my sister Nozali.’
       (A8:57)
  (12) p5š6nwa mevan diya. ‘(If only) I could become her guest.’ (C2:1)15.1.2.5. Other Subordinate Clauses
The qa†6lwa form is used in the various other types of subordinate clauses
that the qa†6l form is used in. It has past tense reference and is dependent,
in principle, on a past verb, which may express perfective or imperfective
aspect, e.g.  (1) b>yéwa palê†wa.} ‘He wanted to come out.’ (A22:45)
  (2) lá-qab6lwa ""áxni saxêxwa.} ‘He did not allow us to swim.’ (A25:20)
  (3) lé y-šawqíwa m†àl6nwa m6nnéy.} ‘They did not let me play with them.’
      (B15:33)
  (4) ràq6nwa} ta-t-mbašlánwa-w qítli bìyux.} ‘I was running in order to cook
      and I knocked into you.’ (A27:42)
  (5) p5rmèxwala qá-t ""5-qálya mbarzêxwale.} ‘We would slaughter them in
      order to dry the fat tail.’ (B5:139)
  (6) qam-t-asèqwa mère †la-bnà°e.} ‘Before he went up he said to his daugh-
      ters . . .’ (A26:85)
  (7) ""i-p5šíwa yá'ni t-la ma†íwa ""7k5le b5°èy.} ‘Only a few of them remained
      without arriving at (the place) where their house was.’ (B15:44)On some sporadic occasions the qa†6lwa form is used in a subordinate
clause that is dependent on a main clause containing a qa†6l form. In such
cases the qa†6l form of the main has past time reference. This is attested
in constructions with the verbs by ‘to want’ and mßy ‘to be able’ in the
main clause, e.g.
590                             chapter fifteen  (8) b8ye qa†êlwale.} ‘He wanted to kill it.’ (A10:2)
  (9) lá-b>ye t-awèðwa lèbe.} ‘He did not want to play tricks.’ (A29:36)
  (10) ""u-lèxma t-la-qßáya là-mß6n t-axlènwale.} ‘I could not eat the bread
       without breaking it.’ (A30:13)It is far more common for a qa†6l form with past time reference to occur
in a subordinate clause dependent on a past tense verb (§15.1.1.13.).","[625, 626, 627, 628, 629]"
"
                    16.6. Repetition of PrepositionsIn certain circumstances prepositions are repeated. In some cases the
purpose of this is to express movement. It is commonly found with the
preposition reš- ‘upon’, which, when repeated, has the sense of ‘across’
or ‘over’, e.g.
818                            chapter sixteen  (1)   lá ""awðèxle ""áwwa gêšra} šáwr6x réša réša d-ánna mìya?} ‘Should we not
        make a bridge for it so that we can go across this water?’ (A17:3)
  (2)   m-7ka m5°ènne b6zmàre} ""u-nasàrta,} ta-t-oðènne gêšra} šàw6r réše réše.}
        ‘From where should I bring you nails and a saw to make him a
        bridge over which he could cross?’ (A17:9)
  (3)   har-""è°y5le m6n-†úra réša-reša d-o-gàre.} ‘He came straight from the
        mountain across that roof.’ (A23:14)
  (4)   plí†5le xa-dídwa m6n-naxìr6t málka,} reša-réša d-a-dudêk°a,} t-wawa
        r6š-d-à-masta,} zílle wírre gu-xá-bor6t kèpe.} ‘A fly came out of the nose
        of the king, (went) across the pipe that was over the yoghurt, and
        entered a pile of stones.’ (A11:5)
  (5)   b-xèlmi zála reša-réša ða-yáma rába gò‰ta,} yáma xwàrta.} ‘In my dream
        I went across a great sea, a white sea.’ (A11:7)Note that in these constructions the preposition has a full nominal inflec-
tion in the form reša or has a pronominal suffix. This contrasts with its
normal contracted form r6š before a noun.
   Other prepositions are occasionally repeated to express movement. This
is attested for the prepositions gu- ‘in’, xo- ‘under’, qam- ‘before’ and ba°6r-/
bar- ‘after’, which in this construction are used with nominal inflection in
the forms gawa, xo°a, qama and ba°ra/bara, e.g.  (6)  síqle gáwa-gaw6t ˙adìqa.} ‘He went up through the garden.’
       (A17:24)
  (7) náša jawújwa gawe-gawe-dìye} palè†wa m-d-7-pa°a xèta.} ‘A person could
       walk through it (the river) and come out the other side.’ (B3:9)
  (8) ""u-gríšle míya m-†ùra} mu°éle xó°a-xo°6t ""ùpra,} muwèrre gu-D6mdêma.} ‘and
       he drew water from the mountain, bringing it under the ground
       and directing it into D6md6ma.’ (A11:14)
  (9) ""è°yela tré malàxe,} pyáða qama-qám6t ‘ádra d-ò-malka.} ‘Two angels
       came, passing in front of the tent of the king.’ (A4:2)
  (10) ""áw npíl5le bá°ra bá°ra tèla.} ‘He followed after the fox.’ (A35:13)
  (11) zílla báre báre dìye.} ‘She went after him.’ (A20:5)The prepositions b- and m6n-, which have multiple meanings, are some-
times repeated when they have a comitative sense. In the construction
with b- the preposition is, in some cases, expressed three times (biye b6-b
‘together with’), e.g.
                        the syntax of prepositions                         819  (12) ßèly5le bìye b-došákka} gu-d-ó tanùra.} ‘He went down together with
       the mattress into the oven.’ (A34:15)
  (13) q6m-maxéle b6-b-qêtta.} ‘He struck it (the sword) together with the
       sheath.’ (A52:18)
  (14) ""áwwa bíye b6-b-sùse} ""áw6r gu-d-o-gêppa.} ‘He together with his horse
       entered a cave.’ (A28:3)
  (15) škíra šêmmux,} márya ""àlaha,} ""7ni q6m-m5°éli láxxa bíye b6-b-sùsi.} ‘May
       your name be praised, Lord God, who have brought me here
       together with my horse.’ (A26:22)
  (16) p7š6t mènni mênni} ""u-t-yánnux ""úpra k6mêt b8y6t.} ‘Stay with me and I
       shall give you as much land as you want.’ (A21:41)
  (17) kút-yoma g8r6g háw6n m6nnéy m6nnèy.} ‘I must be with them everyday.’
       (A8:18).
  (18) hálb6t míya mènne mènne l5šìwale.} ‘Of course they kneaded it together
       with water.’ (B5:16)
  (19) ""ína ""áw t8ra lá t8ra mènne-m6nn6t t8r6t nàše,} m-àwwa bára.} ‘The door
       for this, however, was not together with the door for people on
       this side.’ (B10:53)In (20) the preposition m6n is used with the sense of spatial location and
the repetition conveys the sense of extension that can be captured by the
translation ‘along by’ or ‘alongside’:  (20) ""Ón-Núne npílt5la l-†úra l-†ùra} m6nná-m6nn6t nèra} ""“n-Nune lies between
       one mountain and another alongside a river.’ (B5:148)
               16.7. Genitive Particle with PrepositionsWhen a preposition has a pronominal suffix, it may optionally be extended
with the independent genitive particle bearing the same pronominal suf-
fix, e.g. ""6lle ~ ""6lle diye, biye ~ biye diye, m6nne ~ m6nne diye, gawe ~ gawe
diye. The final syllable of the preposition with the suffix is occasionally
contracted, with the result that the suffix is expressed only on the geni-
tive particle, e.g. bi-díye (B5:126), m6n-díye (B5:158). These extended types
of construction should be contrasted with prepositions that cannot take
pronominal suffixes directly and regularly use the genitive particle to carry
them, e.g. qa-diye ‘to him’.
820                            chapter sixteen   Prepositions with pronominal suffixes that are extended by the genitive
particle are attested predominantly with third person suffixes. It is occa-
sionally found with other suffixes, e.g. ""6lli-díyi ‘to me’ (A7:7).
   Since the preposition in these constructions itself carries a pronominal
suffix, the use of the genitive particle is redundant. Such ‘heavy’ coding
is often used as a type of end weighting in order to mark some kind of
closure. This is reflected by the fact that the constructions are predomi-
nantly used at the end of intonation groups, e.g.  (1)  ""o-náša y-azèlwa ""èlla dìyey.} ‘The man would go to them.’ (B5:21)
  (2)  šúpr6 dúnye hóle ""6lla-dìya.} ‘She had the beauty of the world.’
       (A13:11)
  (3) qá-t ""an-márre la-""á°i ""èlla dìya.} ‘so that diseases do not afflict it.’
       (B5:106)
  (4) ßèly5le tfíqa bíye dìye.} ‘He went down and met him.’ (A13:3)
  (5) mò-""oð6x bíye díye?} ‘What shall we do with him?’ (A14:8)
  (6) ""o-yála zóra ≥àre,} šqíla ""aw-n9re mènne díye.} ‘The young boy, poor
       thing, took the axe with him.’ (A14:12)
  (7) ""ína brón6t málka °èle} ""u-ðà mènne díye.} ‘Behold the son of the king
       has come and a girl is with him.’ (A14:93)
  (8) báh6r t-á°i xákma náše sáxi gáwa dìya.} ‘In Spring some people come
       and swim in it.’ (A14:78)
  (9) ""u-d7r5 xmìra gáwe díye.} ‘and they put leaven in it.’ (B5:100)
  (10) mùtta} b6sra-w gˆrme qáme díye.} ‘He put meat and bones before him.’
       (A25:50)
  (11) g8r6g xaprètla ë6nn6k7ra dìya.} ‘Each year you must dig around it.’
       (B5:105)Equivalent constructions that lack the genitive particle and so are mor-
phologically lighter often occur within an intonation group, e.g.  (12) xár°a tfíqe bíye xèzy6lle ""ína šênya,} npìla.} ‘Then they came across him
       and found that he had fainted and fallen.’ (A14:88)
  (13) ""u-bar d5r7wa gáwe y-as‰ìwala.} ‘After they put it in it, they tied it up.’
       (B5:166)
  (14) ""ína mútta qáme nále-w b6zmàre.} ‘But he put before him horseshoes
       and nails.’ (A25:50)When the genitive particle is omitted at the end of an intonation group,
the clause is generally closely associated with what follows, in that it coheres
                         the syntax of prepositions                            821together with it in a closely knit series of clauses. In some of the examples
below the closure of the series of clauses is signalled on a subsequent clause
by a ‘heavy’ prepositional phrase containing a genitive partice:  (15) malèk°a mêra} kút-xa t-íle rqáða mênna} dàm6x mè«na díya.} ‘The queen
       said that whoever danced with her would sleep with her.’ (A13:2)
  (16) yála zòra} xzi-mêndi} ""í°wa skìnta mènne} ""o-n9ra mènne díye.} ‘(He was) a
       young boy, you see, and he had a knife with him, or an axe with
       him.’ (A14:25)
  (17) ""u-""anna baxtá°a y9ði,} mattí ""íða ""êlle} ‰7ši qá-t ""áwwa m6ndì} hóle xmì""a.}
       ‘The women know (about this), they place a hand on it and feel
       that it is . . . it is leavened.’ (B5:100)
  (18) ""u-""ítwala ""ánna júll6t prìxla bíya,} q6m-†5náli xáßa dìya.} ‘She had
       these clothes with which she flew and carried me on her back.’
       (A14:96)
  (19) šaqèlwa ‘ánta mênne-u} máttu lèxma gàwa,} y-azèlwa ‘yàda,} b7°a bˆ°a.}
       ‘He would take a bag with him, in which he put bread, and would
       go from house to house making invitations.’ (B5:20)The genitive particle is regularly omitted on ""6ll- phrases that mark pro-
nominal objects on compound verbal forms. It was noted above (§16.2.2.2.
iv) that in this context the ""6ll- phrases resemble L-suffixes prosodically
in that they are always bound to the verb in the same stress group. The
lack of a genitive particle is compatible with this tendency for prosodic
lightening of the suffix.

                          17.1. The Copula ClauseMany aspects of the function of the various copulas and the clauses in
which they occur have already been dealt with at length in §8.7. The use
of copulas in the predicate of compound verbal constructions has been
presented in §8.8. Here we shall be concerned with some features of the
word order of copula clauses. The clauses are divided into three groups
according to the type of copula they contain: (i) enclitic copula (including
present and past copula), (ii) independent copula (including present and
past copula) and (iii) deictic copula.","[856, 857, 858, 859, 860, 861, 862]"
"15.1.1.5. Deontic Future (Irrealis)
Among the various forms of irrealis expressed by the qa†6l form is deontic
modality. In such cases while occurring in a main clause without being
subordinated to another verb, it conveys an element of will and expresses
various degrees of intention, obligation, request, and permission regarding
a future action. In this function the verb in principle has perfective aspect.
In most cases it presents the action as a complete event with a start and
endpoint. Sometimes it does not have a clearly delimited endpoint, but it
must have a start point future to the present moment.
   Main clause verbs in the first person used in a deontic function gener-
ally express the intention of the speaker, e.g.  (1)   ""áz6n ""óð6n qáz6d d-àwwa gèppa.} ‘I shall go and make towards this
        cave.’ (A39:3)
  (2)   ""ána q7m6n ""áz6n ""ùmra.} ‘I shall go to church.’ (A37:2)
  (3)   ""ána har-ßál6n mðìta} m7°6n ""ixàla} ""u-""à°ena.} ‘I shall just go down to
        the town to bring food and shall come back.’ (A26:30)In the verb ""mr ‘to say’ the modality can be interpreted as expressing either
intention or a request for permission from the hearer:  (4)   ""amrênn6x xá-m6ndi.} ‘I shall tell you something./Let me tell you
        something.’ (A4:15)
  (5)   ""amrèxlux xà-mdi xéna.} ‘We shall tell you something else./Let us tell
        you something else.’ (A39:8)Questions in the qa†6l forms such as (6–9) are deontic expressions whereby
the speaker addresses the hearer expecting him to impose an obligation
(deontic necessity) or give permission (deontic possibility):

  (7)   mò ""awðéna ""ána hadíya?} ‘What should/can I do now?’ (A26:13)
  (8)   mó ""àw6ð?} ‘What should/can he do?’ (A28:20)
  (9)   lˆka ""azéxi?} ‘Where should we go?’ (A26:18)Such questions in the 1st person can be transposed into the 3rd person
in indirect questions, e.g.  (10) l7ðe gu-d-7ni kúrsi ""àtu.} ‘He does not know in which chair he should
       sit.’ (A40:14)
  (11) l7ði mò ""áwði.} ‘They do not know what they should do.’Deontic qa†6l forms in the 2nd and 3rd person express a variety of types
of will on the part of the speaker, including request, recommendation
and permission, e.g.  (12) ""áxtu kúll5xu ""azítu bˆ°a.} ‘All of you should go home.’ (A8:85)
  (13) yába hàyyo,} ""a°ìtu.} ‘ìdetu.} ‘Come, you (are requested to) come. You
       are invited.’ (A7:3)
  (14) ""ámr6t †la-màlka.} ‘You should say to the king . . .’ (A1:6)
  (15) ""áz6t táwrux p5rmêtle.} ‘You should go and slaughter your ox.’ (A7:2)
  (16) xúwwe ""áz6l dúke dìye.} ‘Let the snake go to its place.’ (A1:8)
  (17) xà-bena ""ázi náše.} ‘People should go (only) once.’ (B15:91)
  (18) kút-yom pál†6t ""u-xàðr6t,} ""áß6rta ""á°6t bˆ°a.} ‘Every day go out and wan-
       der about and then in the evening come back home.’ (A14:62)
  (19) hàtxa ""oðéti b-náše!} ‘This is what you should do to people!’ (A22:47)This type of deontic qa†6l may occur in indirect speech in a subordinate
clause, e.g.  (20) múr †la-xòn6x} qa-t ""êdyo} ""áwði tàgbir} ""ásqi l-ßˆda.} ‘Tell your brother
       that today they should make a plan to go out hunting.’ (A26:43)The use of the form to express iterative actions as in (18) and (19) above
can be accommodated in the interpretation of it as a perfective form, in
that the speaker uses the form that is appropriate to express each individual
perfective occurrence of the iterated situation.
  The various deontic expressions described above can be negated, e.g.
576                          chapter fifteen  (21) ""ána là-""a°6n mènnux.} ‘I shall not come with you.’ (A6:6)
  (22) là-""awr6n gu-má°a.} ‘I shall not go into the village.’ (A25:34)
  (23) là-mßaw°6t!} ‘Do not speak!’ (A26:89)
  (24) là-daqr6t bíye.} ‘Do not touch him.’ (A26:74)
  (25) la-""á°6t t-áwð6t ‘ù-m6ndi.} ‘(There is no requirement for) you to come

  (27) ""áp-xa la-jáw6j m6n-gu-""Amedìa.} ‘Let nobody move from Amedia.’
       (A25:27)Deontic qa†6l forms may be preceded by various preverbal particles:(i) xoš
The particle xoš is in origin the imperative of the verb rxš ‘to go’. It is
most frequently attested with verbs with 3rd person subjects, though it
can be used with all persons. Examples:  (28) ""u-b7°ux xoš-""àq6ð} ‘and may your house burn down.’ (A17:6)
  (29) xoš-""á°a ""àp-anna} ‘Let them also come back.’ (B8:4)
  (30) bas-""7ni t-xzéla ""ày xoš-""áza gu-jahànnam.} ‘But let my eye, which saw
       her, go to hell.’ (A16:2)
  (31) ku-mèndi b8yi xoš-""òði.} ‘Let them do whatever they want.’ (A14:46)
  (32) xoš-""áw6r ""u-""áx6l ""u-šáte gu-p6rdˆsa-w} ‘Let him enter and eat and
       drink in Paradise.’ (A2:8)
  (33) kúlla xoš-dàmxi.} ‘Let everybody sleep.’ (A14:56)
  (34) ""áx‘i xoš-qày6m} xazyánne xàmša daqíqe.} ‘Let him rise for me to see
       him for only five minutes.’ (A4:49)
  (35) suràye} xoš-""ámr6x ""ánna ""ùrze,} xà b-nošéy} ""u-""i-zamríwa ràwe.} ‘The
       Christians, let’s say the men, by themselves, would sit in a recep-
       tion room and sing rawe.’ (B15:75)It is placed before the negative particle la in negative deontic expressions,
e.g.  (36) xóš la-""à°e!} ‘Let him not come!’(ii) d6-, de-
The particle d6-/de- may be related to the adverbial particle diya ‘now’. It
is more frequently attested as a prefix to imperative forms than to deontic
qa†6l forms.

       bag for ourselves. Let’s go to another town.’ (A30:41)
  (38) ""u-""áti d6-ráqð6t š5šátla gàn6x.} ‘You should dance and shake yourself.’
       (A27:11)It may be used in deontic questions such as (39), in which the speaker
addresses the hearer expecting him to impose an obligation or give per-
mission:  (39) de-maxêxle?} ‘Should we beat him?’ (A14:8)It is placed before the negative particle la in negated deontic expressions,
e.g.  (40) ""áti d6-la-dàmxeti!} ‘Do not sleep!’ (A29:19)
  (41) ""ám6r ham-ma-yxàl6f,} 'Abda-Ra˙màn d6-la-""àr6q.} ‘He said “That’s all
       right, (only) don’t let 'Abda-Ra˙màn get away.” ’ (A23:30)
  (42) ""álaha d6-là-""aw6ð!} ‘God forfend!’ (A27:37)The particle may be combined with xoš, e.g.  (43) d6-xoš-gàwra.} ‘Let her marry.’ (A26:79)(iii) šut
As with the other particles, this occurs in both positive and negative
deontic expressions, e.g.  (44) ""6n-maßya šut-""oðala. ‘If she can, let her do it.’ (C1:11)
  (45) šút la-""à°e!} ‘Let him not come!’15.1.1.6. Predictive Future (Irrealis)
The qa†6l is used to predict a future event. In class A verbs that are not
negated this is restricted to predictions that the speaker is not completely
certain about and that he is not guaranteeing will be fulfilled. This can
be designated as a modal future, e.g.  (1)   bálki ""à°ya.} ‘Perhaps she will come.’ (A8:49)
  (2)   bálki ""á°e xa-yóma ""5-bráta kˆrba mènni.} ‘Perhaps a day will come
        when that girl will be angry with me.’ (A14:98)
578                           chapter fifteen  (3)   ""àp-t6mm6l ""áxl6x mènna.} ‘We may (perhaps) eat them also tomorrow.’
        (A2:2)
  (4)   qa-mò ""óð6t ""atxa-šùla?} ‘Why would you do this thing?’ (A8:17)The form is perfective, since it presents actions delimited with a start
and end point or at least with a start point. The form may also express
iterative aspect. In this context the form can still be interpreted as perfec-
tive, in that the speaker uses the form that is appropriate to express each
individual perfective occurrence of the iterated situation, e.g.  (5)   bálki ""á°e kùt-yum} ‘Perhaps he will come everyday.’Non-modal future verbs, by which the speaker asserts that something will
take place and is committed to the truth of this assertion, are expressed
by the b6d-qa†6l form with the prefixed future particle (cf. §15.1.5.). When
negated, however, the qa†6l form in group A verbs is used to express both
the modal predictive future, where the action is uncertain (6–7), and also
the non-modal future, which predict events that the speaker is certain will
take place (8–10), e.g.  (6)  bálki lá-""awð6n xàbrux.} ‘Perhaps I shall not do as you say.’ (A21:43)
  (7)  dàx la-y>ðènne?} ‘How could I not know?’ (A14:90)
  (8)  ""áti xúwwe là ""axèll6x.} ‘The snake will not eat you.’ (A24:39)
  (9)  málla t-axèlla ""aw-lá-""ax6l ‘ú-mdi sab-rùt5la.} ‘The mullah will eat it
       and he will eat nothing because it is Friday.’ (A2:4)
  (10) qázi t-awèdla †làlux,} lá-""aw6dla †làli.} ‘The judge will make a decision
       in your favour, he will not make it in my favour.’ (A6:8)In class B verbs the qa†6l form is used to express the modal and non-modal
future in both positive and negated clauses, e.g.  (11) qa†lênnux.} ‘I shall kill you.’ (A15:4)
  (12) ""àna ma°yánne.} ‘I shall bring her back.’ (A27:30)
  (13) bálki qàrm6n.} ‘Perhaps I shall win.’ (A1:4)
  (14) brát6t màlka} pál†a l-gàre.} ‘The daughter of the king will come out
       onto the roof.’ (A27:11)
  (15) ""aw-máy6° ""u-""ùpra páy6š bíyi.} ‘He will die and his land will remain
       for me.’ (A26:25)
  (16) ""o-Mar-Mùše} x5làn5le,} maxèl5xu.} ‘Saint Muše is strong. He will strike
       you.’ (B18:7)
                               the syntax of verbs                                   579When expressing the future, the qa†6l form may have its deictic centre in
the past, as is the case with (17) where it occurs in the context of a past
narrative:  (17) hád6x m-bar-t-gwìrra,} ""aláha q6m-yawèlla xa-bròna.} ""ìma?} ""7-šet6t mˆ°i.}
       ""7-šet6t m7°i q6m-yawèlla xa-bróna zòra.} ‘So, after they married, God
       gave them a son. When? The year they would die. The year they
       would die, He gave them a small son.’ (A4:57)15.1.1.7. Conditional Constructions (Irrealis)
The qa†6l form is used in the protasis of conditional sentences referring
to present or future time, e.g.  (1)   ""6n-""ána ""amrènnux módile xèzya málka b-xêlme,} ""ánna ""álpa dáwe p>lêtla,}
        pálga †làli} pálga †làlux?} ‘If I tell you what the king saw in his dream,
        will you divide those thousand gold pieces, half for me and half
        for you?’ (A1:6)
  (2)   bas-""èn ""á°ya xá-baxta nabláli qa-kut-t-b9ya,} y6n-qa-xóna dìya,} ""ána bt-
        azàna.} ‘But, if a woman comes to take me to anyone she wants,
        or to her brother, I shall go.’ (A8:78)
  (3)   ""6n-lá-""oð6t b-xábr6t ""alàha,} b-talqèti.} ‘If you do not do the word of
        God, you will be obliterated.’ (A8:97)
  (4)   ""6n-lá-""az6n mšàyð6n.} ‘If I do not go, he will go mad.’ (A4:27)The qa†6l form occurs in the apodosis when there is a degree of uncertainty
concerning the occurrence of the situation. This is attested in contexts
where two possible alternative situations are referred to, e.g.  (5)   ""6n-íle mì°a,} g8r6g mˆ°6n.} ""u-""6n-""à°e} ""á°y6n mênne.} ‘If he is dead, I
        must die. If he comes back, I shall come back with him.’ (A8:61)
  (6)   ""6n-""óð6t xàbri,} ""òð6t.} ""6n-lá ""òð6t,} kli°à-llux-ila.} ‘If you do as I say, you
        will do so (so be it). If you do not do so, it is up to you.’ (A8:44)15.1.1.8. Irrealis Complement Clauses
The qa†6l form occurs in subordinate clauses that are complements of
various verbs and expressions when the action of the verb in the subor-
dinate clause is as yet unrealized. It is used after verbs expressing desire
and permission (e.g. by ‘to want’, šwq, qbl ‘to permit’), and also in comple-
ments of various other verbs and predications where the action is as yet
unrealized relative to the main clause. The qa†6l form in the subordinate
580                            chapter fifteenclause expresses perfective aspect, in that it presents the action as an event
with start and endpoint or at least one that is delimited by a start point
future to the present moment. It may also be used to denote an iterative
activity. In this function it is still perfective, since the speaker uses the
form that is appropriate to express each individual perfective occurrence
of the iterated situation.
   The verb of such subordinate clauses is sometimes introduced by the
subordinating particle D. This particle is, however, often omitted. Its omis-
sion is particularly common after the verb by ‘to want’, e.g.  (1)   ""áp-""ana b8y6n ""àz6n.} ‘I also want to go.’ (A1:5)
  (2)   b8y6n ""amrênn6x.} ‘I want to tell you.’ (A4:41)
  (3)   b8ye ""á°e xazèlux.} ‘He wants to come and see you.’ (A4:24)
  (4)   ""ána b8y6n mênn6x} ""àwwa xóni} ""oðátle xá-ga xéta m>d6‰ètle nèšma dìye.} ‘I
        want you to make my brother (alive) again and return his breath
        to him.’ (A8:80)
  (5)   b8y6x xá-m6ndi gu-t9ra qablítula.} ‘We want you to pledge her some-
        thing on the doorstep.’ (B10:36)On some occasions, the particle occurs before the verb of the comple-
ment clause, e.g.  (6)   b8y6n t-àz6n.} ‘I want to go.’ (A8:65)
  (7)   b8y6n ""álaha t-yawèlli mèndi zàwda.} ‘I want God to give me something
        more.’ (A3:1)Examples with other verbs:  (8)  ""áp-xa la-qábl6t t-áw6r gu-bˆ°a.} ‘You should not allow anybody to
       come into the house.’ (A23:25)
  (9) d6-šúql6n dàmx6x.} ‘Allow us to us sleep.’ (A15:8)
  (10) ""u-hálle ßàle,} šám6† qðále dìye.} ‘Let him go down (the mountain) and
       break his neck.’ (A15:13)
  (11) l7le ßbára t-áw6r xà.} ‘Nobody dares enter.’ (A32:32)
  (12) ""o-t-l7le plíxa là sáp6r t-áx6l.} ‘Whoever has not worked should not
       expect to eat.’ (A21:15)The negative particle la is sometimes used in clauses that are the comple-
ment of the verb zd"" ‘to fear’, reflecting a negative deontic dimension to
the situation, e.g.
                             the syntax of verbs                              581  (13) hon-zála réš6 d-ò gèšra,} ""ína ràba zdá""a} t-là-napl6n gu-d-a-yáma.} ‘I went
       over the bridge, fearing greatly that I would fall into the sea
       (= wishing that I would not fall).’ (A11:7)The qa†6l form occurs in complements of expressions of obligation con-
sisting of the impersonal forms g>r6g, laz6m, b>ye (‘it is necessary’), the
former of these being the most common one. The complement clause is
not introduced by the particle D, e.g.  (14) g8r6g ""àmr6x.} ‘We must say.’ (A4:38)
  (15) g8r6g ""à°6t.} ‘You must come.’ (A7:9)
  (16) g8r6g ""ázi b6°-be-xêtna.} ‘They must go to the house of the groom.’
       (B5:36)
  (17) g8r6g rába ""áxl6t xàm.} ‘You have to be very careful.’ (B5:105)
  (18) bèl-šèdla l-šêdla} g8r6g mátteti xa-xamšá ""aqlà°a.} ‘Between the saplings

  (19) láz6m ""axlênne.} ‘I must eat him.’ (A47:5)
  (20) hadíya b8ye mpal†êtle.} ‘Now you must take him out.’ (A26:77)The negative particle is placed before the verb in the complement clause,
e.g.  (21) g8r6g là-""amr6t hátxa.} ‘You must not say that.’ (A18:10)The qa†6l form occurs in complements of the verb mßy ‘to be able’ and
also of various other expressions denoting possibility (or lack of it). The
particle D is used in these constructions, though not consistently, e.g.  (22) máß6x t-àmr6x.} ‘We can say.’ (B4:3)
  (23) máß6x ""àmr6x.} ‘We can say.’ (B15:16)
  (24) máßi m†àli gáwa.} ‘They can play in it.’ (B11:30)

The qa†6l form is sometimes used in a clause introduced by the preposi-
tional phrases qam ‘before’, ha-t, hal ""5-g6t, ta ‘until’ or t-la ‘without’, which
refer to an event that has not yet taken place from the perspective of the
verb in the main clause, e.g.  (1) qam-t-à°i} mpál6†le m6n-hàbsa.} ‘Before they return, release him from
      prison.’ (A26:72)
  (2) qám t-qáre ""ax-dìga,} šáql6t m6n-d-ó ""ixàla.} ‘Before it calls out like a cock,

      (A50:15)15.1.1.10. Purpose Clauses (Irrealis)
The qa†6l form is used in clauses expressing purpose. These clauses are
sometimes introduced simply by the particle D. In many cases, however,
this is combined with the particles qa or ta, e.g.  (1) ""ána paqðênn5xu} t-azítu b-""úrxa ma†ítu ""êlla.} ‘I shall instruct you so that
      you go on the road and reach her.’ (A8:27)

       up early to work for myself, so that I can eat?’ (A21:19)Occasionally the D particle is elided before the initial consonant of class
B verbs, e.g.  (11) b>yánna bìya} b-sùsa} b-ráš6n diyéy kùlla,} ta-ßály6n ma°yànne.} ‘I want
       them all with their horse and rations, in order for me to go down
       to bring him back.’ (A25:75)
  (12) táxt5la mútte hàtxa} ta-ßáli tàma.} ‘They have put a board like this in
       order to go down there.’ (A22:10)15.1.1.11. After Particle of Imminent Future ga-
The element ga-, most likely in origin the noun gaya ‘time, instance’, takes
a verb in the qa†6l form introduced by the subordinator D as its comple-
ment to express the imminent future (‘is about to . . .’), e.g.  (1)   ga-t-à°6n.} ‘I am about to come.’The subordinator D is often elided before consonants:  (2)   ga-t-pàrq6n} ~ ga-pàrq6n.} ‘I am about to finish.’
  (3)   ga-t-mà†6x} ~ ga-mà†6x.} ‘We are about to arrive.’The construction is attested in the text corpus in (4):  (4)   ""è°y5la ""àrye.} ""ê°ye,} ""ê°ye,} š-l7wa mè†ye ""6lle-dìye,} há há ga-má†ya t-axlàle,}
        dèry6lla bòóe.} dèry6lla bòóe,} qíme tre-xùre.} ‘The lions came. They came,
584                              chapter fifteen      but they had not yet reached him. “Hah, hah” she is about to eat
      him. So, he cast the seeds. When he cast the seeds, two willow trees
      grew up.’ (A18:26)15.1.1.12. Generic Relative Clauses
The qa†6l form is used in a relative clause that has a non-specific anteced-
ent rather than one referring to a specific referent, e.g.  (1) ""alpá-dáwe b6d-yáw6l †la-kút ""amèrre mòdile xèlme.} ‘I shall give a thousand
      gold pieces to whomsoever tells me what my dream is.’ (A1:12)
  (2) kút ""ás6q qamáya xazéla ""5-dalí°a brì°6ll-ani} parêmla.} ‘The first one who
      goes up and sees the vine growing on those (trees) cuts it down.’
      (A26:91)
  (3) kút-duk°a ""áza ""àwra} ""áp ""ayya-xéta bàra láz6m háwya.} ‘Every place that
      she goes to and enters, the other has to follow after her.’ (B12:2)
  (4) ""an-t-óði koðênta,} t-awéle tùna.} ‘Those who keep (literally: do) mules
      have hay.’ (B5:108)15.1.1.13. In Subordinate Clauses with Past Time Reference
On numerous occasions, the qa†6l form is used in subordinate clauses in
the contexts described above also when the main clause contains a past
form verb. Such qa†6l forms have past time reference, with their deictic
centre in the tense of the main clause, e.g.  (1) ""u-b>yéwa palè†-u plì†le.} ‘He wanted to come out and he did come
      out.’ (A22:45)
  (2) ßêly5le} ta-t-""áz6l ""ùrxa.} ‘He went down to set off on the road.’
      (A15:5)
  (3) ""u-t8ra óím6lle ta-t-lá-""aw6r ""áp-xa náša gàwa.} ‘They closed the door so
      that nobody would go into it.’ (A23:24)
  (4) qímt5la šqílt5la xa-bròna} ""u-nobàlt6lle} ta-t-axlàle.} ‘She got up and
      took a son (of hers) and took him in order for her to eat him.’
      (A19:3)
  (5) ""u-síqle ta-t-áx6l mêndi.} ‘He went up to eat something.’ (A21:8)
  (6) ""áy wela-""á-bráta xar7°6t m†úmra gu-Dùre,} qam-maqimìl6n.} ‘That was the
      last girl to be buried in Dure before they evacuated us.’ (B1:12)
  (7) ""u-zílela ha-t-ázi má†i l-""á°‰6t . . . d-áw . . . báb6 d-a-bràta.} ‘They travelled
      until they reached the land of the girl’s father.’ (A29:36)

The qa†6lwa form, with the past verbal affix -wa, always has past time
reference. It has both realis and irrealis functions.","[613, 614, 615, 616, 617, 618, 619, 620, 621, 622, 623, 624]"
"17.7.8. Independent Object Pronouns
Occasionally an independent pronoun or anaphoric demonstrative pro-
noun is used to express a pronominal direct object. It is placed either before
or after the verb. This construction is found in the following contexts.
880                            chapter seventeen   When placed before the verb, on some occasions the pronoun is topical
in status and the clause coheres closely with what precedes, e.g.  (1) ""aw-y-oðêxwa.} ‘We would do that.’ (B10:49)
  (2) ""áti xúwwe là ""axèll6x.} ‘The snake will not eat you.’ (A24:39)The motivation to use the independent pronoun is in some cases to place
the topical referent in contrastive opposition, e.g.  (3) mèra lá-dri x7l6t gànux.} ""ána °í°6n mpal†ánnux m-gu-sêj6n.} mère lát-°i°a
      ""ána mpaló†6lli m-gu-sêj6n.} °í°6t šqála ""áyya róxi m6n-gu-gàni.} mèra
      là""a!} ""ána °í°6n mpal†ànnux} ""áxxa l-tàmma,} lá-dri xˆla!} ‘She said “Do
      not struggle. I have come to bring you out of the prison.” He said
      “You have not come to bring me out of the prison. You have come
      to take my spirit from me.” ’ (A26:82)When an independent pronoun with topical status is placed after the verb
in addition to or in place of an L-suffix, the motivation appears to be
to give the construction morphological weighting to mark some kind of
discourse boundary. In (4) and (5) the pronouns occur at an end bound-
ary, whereas their occurrence in (6) and (7) coincide with an onset. The
event in (6) marks the return to the narrative after direct speech. In (7)
the clause marks the onset of a deontic section that is the main point of
the speech, after an initial background section:  (4) kúlla hon-xìl6lla.} . . . xíllux táma mubsêmlux.} ""ána q6m-†arðìli.} ""è°y6n m-k7rbi
      hon-xíl6lla ""ày.} ‘I have eaten all of it . . . You ate there and enjoyed
      yourself. They drove me out and, out of my anger, I have come
      and eaten it.’ (A2:11)

  (6) là b>yènna.} šqúl sì!} qím5le šqìla-""ani} ""u-m5dê‰6lla.} núbl6lla qa-bráte

                                  the clause                                 881The pronoun may have a narrow information focus, in which case it takes
the nuclear stress and is often fronted before the verb,  (8)   ""ána ""àti b8y6n} ‘I love you’ (A25:31)The narrow focus may be inclusive, e.g.  (9)   qa-t-nablánne ""ap-""àw.} ‘so that I take also him.’ (A8:80)An independent pronoun is used when its referent is conjoined with other
items in the direct object phrase, e.g.  (10) ""è°yela déwe gu-ða-lawùrta} xíl6lle ""àw-u xmáre díye.} ‘Wolves came into
       a valley and ate him and his donkey.’ (A14:17)
  (11) ""ána mšúdr6n Gúzali ""u-""àti.} ‘I sent you and Gozali.’ (A8:91)17.7.9. Verb—Prepositional Phrase
A prepositional phrase expressing an indirect object or some other comple-
ment of the verb is normally placed after the verb, e.g.  (1)   ""ám6r ""èlle dìye.} ‘He says to him.’ (A21:2)
  (2)   má†e l-‘ádr6t bábe dìye.} ‘He arrives at the tent of his father.’ (A28:33)
  (3)   q7°a b-ˆ-""aqla.} ‘It strikes the leg.’ (B7:24)
  (4)   ßléle r6š-xa-""ˆna.} ‘He alighted at a spring.’ (A15:1)
  (5)   wúr gu-d-áwwa bˆ°a.} ‘Enter this room.’ (A22:26)The nuclear stress is generally placed on the prepositional phrase, unless
this is pronominal, in which case the nucleus exhibits a greater tendency
to be placed on the verb, e.g.  (6)   pàl†6n m-gáwe.} ‘Let me come out of it.’ (A20:3)
  (7)   ""u-dêry6lle gáwa díya.} ‘He put him in it.’ (A22:38)17.7.10. Verb—Object—Prepositional Phrase
When the clause also contains a direct object nominal, this is normally
placed before the prepositional phrase complement, e.g.
882                           chapter seventeen  (1) ""u-máxa xa-mèšxa gu-be-""éne dìye.} ‘They put some oil on his forehead.’
      (B6:36)
  (2) mattíwa bála b-áql6 susèy.} ‘They directed their attention to the leg of
      their horse.’ (A8:30)
  (3) y-awðíwa sàdde gáwa.} ‘They would put partitions in them.’ (B7:10)
  (4) ma°yáwa ða-k7rt6 q7sa l-xáßa dìya.} ‘He would bring a bundle of wood
      on her back.’ (A10:6)A related construction is where an item is named by the expression ‘to
say to it x’. The constituent expressing the name in principle takes the
nuclear stress and is an information focus. It may be placed either after
(5–6) or before (7–8) the verb, e.g.  (5) mattíwala xa-dúk°a šaxìnta} t-amrèxxa gòma.} ‘They would place them
      in a warm place, which we call a goma (basement).’ (B5:12)
  (6) y-amríwala qàzbe.} ‘They called them qazbe (dates).’ (B5:12)
  (7) ""6n-b9y6t} zaqrênn6x} xa-qur†àla,} sàla y-amrèxle.} ‘I’ll weave you a large
      basket, we call it a sala (basket).’ (A20:2)
  (8) ""u-dwíqt6lle ""ixála gu-‘ánte dìye,} jarrèta y-amrèxla.} ‘She packed food in
      his bag—we call it a jarreta (lunchbox).’ (A21:11)17.7.11. Prepositional Phrase—Verb
A prepositional phrase is fronted before the verb in similar contexts to
those in which a direct object constituent is fronted. A distinction should
be made between constructions where the fronted phrase bears the nuclear
stress and those in which it does not. The latter type of construction
without the nuclear stress on the initial phrase may be ‘event-orientated’
or ‘topic-orientated’. Event-orientated constructions are closely cohesive
with what precedes, e.g.  (1) ""i-mattíle š-kèpe,} xó°e díye y-óði nùra.} ‘They put it on stones and make
      a fire under it.’ (B6:45)
  (2) ""áw mattíle š-©ðàðe,} y-amríle huðàla.} mattíle š-©ðàðe} y-amríle huðàla.} qa-
      ""ìma?} qa-sêtwa,} qa-haywáne diyèy.} š-d-ó huðàla} ""i-mátti pùwuš,} sab-púwuš
      la-ßála míya bi-dìye.} ‘They stack it up. This is called a huðala (fod-
      der stack). They stack it up, it is called a fodder stack. For when
      (is this prepared)? For the winter, for their animals. On top of this
      fodder stack they put hay, since water does not seep through hay.’
      (B5:113)
                                  the clause                                 883In (3) the clause has both a fronted direct object and a fronted preposi-
tional phrase:  (3)   ""ám6r là-b>y6nna lá zùz6x} ""u-la-‘ù-m6ndi.} ""u-ya-""àlaha,} zíl5le rìq5le.}
        ""an-zúze †la-d-àw,} †la-d-o-˙ammàla} là-yiwla.} ‘He said “I
        don’t want your money or anything” and he was off, he fled. She
        did not give the money to him, to that porter.’ (A22:46)Topic-orientated types of the construction are attested in contexts where
two events are presented as occurring in parallel, e.g.  (4)   mu°7°5la tré glàse.} †la-d-áy dráy5la xà‘‘a} †la-d-áw ràba.} ‘She brought
        two glasses. For herself she pours out a little and for him a lot.’

"8.19.4. Pronominal Direct Objects on Compound Verbal Forms
In compound verbal constructions consisting of a form of the verb ‘to be’
and the resultative participle or infinitive, the direct pronominal object is
expressed by L-suffixes consisting of the preposition l-, as in other verbal
forms, or by a pronominal suffix attached to the longer preposition ""6ll-.
The use of L-suffixes reflects the treatment of these compound forms as
fully verbal in nature.
284                             chapter eight8.19.4.1. Resultative Participle + Present Enclitic Copula (q†il5le)
The normal position of the L-suffix is after the enclitic copula. The forms
of the construction with the 3ms. L-suffix are as follows:      3rd pers.     ms.        q†íl6lle         ‘He has killed him’
                               (q†íl5lele)
                    fs.        q†ílt6lle        ‘She has killed him’
                               (q†ílt5lale)
                    pl.        q†íl6lle         ‘They have killed him’
                               (q†ílel5le)      2nd pers.     ms.        q†íl6tle         ‘You (ms.) have killed him’
                    fs.        q†ílt6tle        ‘You (fs.) have killed him’
                    pl.        q†íletule        ‘You (pl.) have killed him’      1st pers.     ms.        q†íl6nne         ‘I (ms.) have killed him’
                    fs.        q†ílt6nne        ‘I (fs.) have killed him’
                    pl.        q†íl6xle         ‘We have killed him’
                               q†íl6xxeThe enclitic copula before the object suffix regularly has a contracted form
(q†il6t < q†il5w6t, q†il6n < q†il5w6n, etc.). Contraction of the 3rd person copula
also takes place, which results in the elision of the final vowel before the
L-suffix. Forms such as q†il5lele in which the 3rd person copula retains its
shape are used, but so rarely that they have been put in brackets in the
paradigm. The stress generally remains on the participle in the same posi-
tion as it would occur without the object suffixes. Occasionally, however,
it is moved onto the inflectional suffix, e.g. q†il•tle, q†il•nne. This movement
of stress is more frequently found with 1st and 2nd person subjects than
with 3rd person subjects.
    The L-suffix is occasionally replaced by the long preposition ""6ll-, e.g.      3rd pers.       ms.      q†íl5l6lle      ‘He has killed him’
      2nd pers.       ms.      q†íl6t6lle      ‘You (ms.) have killed him’
      1st pers.       ms.      q†íl6n6lle      ‘I (ms.) have killed him’Examples: r•py5l6lla} ‘He threw it down’ (A25:33), rípel6lle ‘They attacked

""6ll- phrase expressing the object is often placed before the copula element.
This ordering is not used when the copula is 1st or 2nd person, e.g.     3rd pers.    ms. q†íl6ll5le (< q†ila-6lla-ile)      ‘He has killed her’
     3rd pers.    fs. q†ílt6llela (< q†ilta-6lle-ila)    ‘She has killed him’
     3rd pers.    pl. q†íl6lluxila (< q†ila-6llux-ila)   ‘They have killed
                                                         you’8.19.4.2. Resultative Participle + Past Enclitic Copula
When object suffixes are attached to the construction consisting of a
resultative participle and past enclitic copula, the inflectional endings that
are generally used are based on the first paradigm in the previous section
(§8.19.4.1.), in which object suffixes are combined with the present enclitic
copula, rather than directly on forms with the past enclitic copula. The
particle wa is simply added before the L-suffix throughout the paradigm.
The most conspicuous result of this is in the 3rd person, in which the /l/
element of the present copula is retained, although this element does not
occur in any form of the past copula.     3rd pers.     ms.       q†íl6lwale      ‘He had killed him’
                   fs.       q†ílt6lwale     ‘She had killed him’
                   pl.       q†íl6lwale      ‘They had killed him’, etc.     2nd pers.     ms.       q†íl6twale
                   fs.       q†ílt6twale
                   pl.       q†íletuwale     1st pers.     ms.       q†íl6nwale
                   fs.       q†ílt6nwale
                   pl.       q†íl6xwaleThe 3rd person forms with the /l/ element are sometimes used also with
a transitive verb without a pronominal object suffix, e.g. ""áy šwíqt6lwa májma
tàma} ‘She had left a tray there’ (A4:53).
   Occasionally the expected form of the 3rd past copula is used, without
the /l/ element, e.g. šít5w6lle ‘She had plastered it’ (A23:36), which can be
analysed as šita + iwa + 6lle. In the attested cases of this construction the
pronominal object element is attached to the long preposition ""6ll- rather
than the short preposition l- (i.e. in an L-suffix):
286                            chapter eight      3rd pers.   ms.   q†íl5w6lle (< q†ila-iwa-6lle)     ‘He had killed him’
                  fs.   q†ílt5w6lle (< q†ilta-iwa-6lle)   ‘She had killed him’
                  pl.   q†ílew6lle (< q†ile-iwa-6lle)     ‘They had killed him’8.19.4.3. Non-Enclitic Copula or hwy + Resultative Participle
When a non-enclitic type of copula, such as the deictic or negative copula,
or the verb hwy precedes the resultative participle, the pronominal object
suffixes are attached to the preposition ""6ll-, which in turn is suffixed to
the end of the participle:Deictic copula
      3rd pers.   ms.    hóle q†íl6lle     ‘He has killed him’

"19.3.2.1. Zero Marking
The factive complement clause may be embedded under the verb without
any marking of subordination. This is regularly the case after the verb ‘to
say’ when the clause expresses reported speech and is frequently found
also after other verbs, e.g.  (1) hóla màra} xzí°6lle xa-bron6t-xà-malka.} ‘She says that she saw the son of
      a king.’ (A4:12)
  (2) ""ána hon-màra} ""áwwa rèši} t-á°e xá-yoma pràma} b6d-""i°á°a dìyux.} ‘I say that
      this head of mine will one day be cut off by your hands.’ (A14:35)
  (3) lá-m6r5xu ""áyya qußárta hóla b-""ùrxa?} ‘Did you not say that this cooking

      I did not say that you are a murderer. I did not say that you are a
      good man. I did not say that you are a trickster.’ (A1:21)
  (5) y>ðána mbádla qa†•lli ""aw-màlka.} ‘I know that the king will kill me in
      the morning.’ (A14:3)

      or three times.’ (B15:24)
  (8) ""áni xášwi ""áti ""àn6n.} ‘They will think that you are me.’ (A7:18)19.3.2.2. D
The clause may be introduced by the subordinator D, e.g.  (1) ""ánna y8ði t-íle duglàna.} ‘They know that he is a liar.’ (A48:3)
  (2) ""ay-xá-yoma har-t-y9ða} t-íle mí°a bròn6n.} ‘She will surely know one day

      you that your cooking pot is dead.’ (A5:10)19.3.2.3. Raising of Subject
In some cases the subject component of the embedded clause is raised
into the main clause where it functions as the direct object of the verb.
This is attested in (1)–(3), in which a pronominal copy of the subject of
the subordinate clause is attached as an object suffix to the main verb:  (1) ""u-y>ðánne xón6x hole-gòt6x.} ‘I know that your brother is by your side.’
      (A8:79)
  (2) m-ˆka q6m-y>ð•tli ""áti t-íw6n Gozáli?} ‘How did you know that I am
      Gozali?’ (A8:41)
  (3) bálki y>ðálux ""áti t-it-Gozàli.} ‘Perhaps she knows that you are Gozali.’
      (A8:49)19.3.3. ""iman
When the interrogative particle ""iman ‘when?’ is used as the governor of
a subordinate content clause, it has a temporal adverbial function. The
combination of ""iman + D is often reduced phonetically to ""im6t. The subor-
dinate clause is normally placed before the main clause and, in most cases,
is uttered in a separate intonation group from that of the main clause.
   The main clause may express an action that is temporally sequential to
the action in the subordinate clause or one that overlaps with it temporally.","[1019, 1020]"
"17.1.1.2. Clauses Containing a Subject Constituent
When the clause contains a subject constituent in the form of an inde-
pendent pronoun or a nominal, the subject is normally placed before the
824                         chapter seventeenpredicate and the copula is suffixed to the predicate with the nuclear stress
occurring on the predicate, e.g.  (1)   ""ána màlk6n.} ‘I am a king.’ (A4:30)
  (2)   ""áwwa nišànq5le.} ‘It is a symbol.’ (B5:41)
  (3)   bráta zamàrt5la.} ‘The girl is a singer.’ (A25:68)
  (4)   xáli zàngin-ile.} ‘My uncle is rich.’ (A23:3)
  (5)   w-áw xamìm5wa.} ‘It was warm.’ (B5:154)
  (6)   xóne díye f>qìra-wewa.} ‘His brother was poor.’ (A25:1)When the predicate is a 1st or 2nd person pronoun, the copula agrees
with the predicate, e.g.  (7)   ""áni xášwi ""áti ""àn6n.} ‘They will think you are me.’ (A7:18)The subject constituent may occur in a separate intonation group. Con-
structions such as these often occur at some kind of boundary in the
discourse. The clause in (8), for example, opens a section of discourse
concerning the village saint’s festival. The clause in (9) marks the onset
of a concluding comment on the preceding foreground section of the
discourse concerning the cultivation of apples. The clause in (10) occurs
at the onset of a turn of speech:  (8)  šèra} xa-t6xrùny5le.} ‘The festival is a memorial.’ (B5:69)
  (9)  ""u-xayu°èy} b-àyy5wa.} ‘Their livelihood was in this (profession).’
       (B5:106)
  (10) ""ána-w ""àti} xon>wà°5w6x.} ‘You and I are brothers.’ (A26:49)The copula is occasionally placed on the subject constituent. The motiva-
tion for such a construction is to express the prominence of the subject.
This may be focal prominence or topical prominence (§15.4.1.4.1. i–ii).
When it has focal prominence it functions as an information focus. This
is signalled on the prosodic level by the placement of the nuclear stress
on the subject constituent, e.g.  (11) ""áwwa lˆle kálba,} ""àtit kálba.} ‘He is not a dog, you are a dog.’
       (A11:20)
  (12) dêbb5la táma} ‘The bear is there.’ (A20:7)
                                   the clause                                    825In (11) and (12) the predicate belongs to the presuppositional background
of the clause. In (11), for example, the presupposition is ‘x is a dog’ and the
subject constituent supplies the new information that x is to be identified
with ‘you’. The clauses are used in a context in which the speaker assumes
that the hearer is entertaining another referent for the role in question
and the purpose of the construction is to reverse this expectation.
   In (13) the construction is used to express an exclusive focus after the
particle har:  (13) lèmu har-àtit ""árya?} ‘Is it only you who are a lion? (literally: Only you
       are a lion?)’ (A46:3)When the subject constituent with the enclitic copula is topically promi-
nent, the nuclear stress remains on the predicate. The topical prominence
of the referent arises from the fact that it has been evoked in the imme-
diately preceding discourse. This construction is not regularly used with
all subject constituents that have been previously evoked. The purpose
of the ‘heavy coding’ of the initial topical subject is to mark a boundary
in the discourse, endowing the clause with a distinctness from what pre-
cedes. This may mark a new discourse section, as in (14) and (15), where
the clauses are concluding comments on a preceding foreground section.
The construction is also used to give a clause distinctness for the sake of
making it more prominent, as is the case in (16):  (14) ""áwwa mèšxa y-amrèxle óìta.} ""áwwa ""i-map6lxìle} ""èn y-axlíle b-lêxma,} ""èn
       ""i-d5ríle b-rêzza,} . . . ""áyy5la óìta.} ‘We call this butter óita. They use
       it—either they eat it on bread or they put it in rice or, when they
       cook rice . . . This is butter.’ (B6:40–41)
  (15) ""o-yál6t b>yàwale} hóle ""ê°ya-w} q6m-yawèlla yalêx°a ""èlli.} ""u-""áyy5la kùlla.}
       ‘The young man whom she loved has come and has given me her
       scarf. That is all.’ (A4:24)
  (16) xúwwele q†ìla.} ‘The snake is killed.’ (A24:42)The topical prominence marked by the copula may also be forward
pointing, i.e. the item is marked as having relevance in the subsequent
discourse. This is found in constructions with the deictic form hatxa or
had6x ‘thus’, when it has a forward pointing correlative function in that it
relates to what is specified in the following clause, e.g.
826                         chapter seventeen  (17) hátx5la qa∂ìya} málka hóle mú°y6lla bráte dìye} ""u-hóle míra ""áyya bráti
       qa-brònux.} ‘This is the situation: the king has brought his daughter
       and said “This daughter of mine is for your son, that is she will
       become your wife.” ’ (A21:8)The enclitic copula, therefore, expresses a general prominence, which is
unmarked with regard to its pragmatic nature. The nucleus of the intona-
tion group, on the other hand, expresses a new information focus. The
two devices usually coincide, in that the enclitic copula is generally placed
on the element that is the new information focus of the clause. They may,
however, operate independently, as in (14)–(17).
   On some occasions the subject constituent is placed after the predicate.
In such cases the enclitic copula and the nuclear stress are generally on
the predicate, e.g.  (18) ""àww5le geyása.} ‘The geyasa ceremony is this.’ (B6:4)
  (19) ""ànn5la ""eð>wá°6 diy7ni.} ‘Our festivals are these.’ (B6:16)
  (20) y-ásq6x m7°6x míya m6n-d->wàha †úra.} rába rê˙q5le ""o-†úra.} ‘We shall go
       up and fetch water from that mountain over there. That mountain
       is very far away.’ (A39:9)
  (21) mšadóre ""èlla dìya} ""u-náše °èla} q6m-ban7le b7°e dìye,} gu-""èšta šáwwa
       yomàne,} ""ašír6t ràb°a-wawa Jazíre Bóta.} ‘She sent them to her and
       people came and rebuilt his house, in six or seven days. Jazire Bota
       was a large community (consisting of many people).’ (A26:59)
  (22) xzéle b-xèlme dìye} ""í° xa-náša gu-d-áy mðìta} biš-f>qíra m-kúlla nàša.}
       rába f>qìra-wewa ""awwa-náša.} ‘He saw in his dream that there was
       a man in the town who was poorer than anybody else. The man
       was very poor.’ (A8:3)Constructions with postposed subjects such as (18)–(22) are typically used to
express an elaborative comment on something that has been talked about
in the immediately preceding discourse. They are intended to be cohesive
with what precedes more than with what follows. The subject is a topical
referent and not part of the information focus of the clause.
   This construction is used also in clauses that repeat information that
has been given in what immediately precedes without advancing the dis-
course. This is the case in (23), where the postposed subject is placed in
a separate intonation group:
                                    the clause                                     827  (23) mèra g8r6g m7°6t sisisàmb6r.} sáw6n Tóma smèle, píšle kòra.} sisisàmb6r}
       ""ˆk5la?} k6s-Lelì°a.} ""áp-xa lá-maße má†e ""èlla dìya.} k6s-Lelì°5la} sisisàmb6r.}
       ‘They said “You must bring the sisisamb6r plant. Grandfather
       Toma has become blind.” “Where is the sisisamb6r?” “With Leli°a.
       Nobody can reach it. The sisisamb6r is with Leli°a.” ’ (A50:1)When the referent of the subject constituent has been mentioned in the
immediately preceding discourse, the copula is occasionally placed on the
postposed subject rather than on the predicate. The copula in such cases
signals the topical prominence of the subject constituent, e.g.  (24) mère k yˆle qáßre díye?} . . . mère "">wà""ha qáßre díyele.} ‘He said “Where is
       his residence?” . . . He said “His residence is that (over there).” ’
       (A37:10)The motivation for a construction with a postposed subject such as (24)
is again to signal cohesiveness with what precedes, in this case supplying
the answer to a preceding question. When, conversely, a topical subject
constituent occurs at the front of a clause, this typically expresses a less
cohesive connection with what precedes. As we have seen, the discourse
boundary marking function may be enhanced by increasing the coding
of the subject topic by means of the enclitic copula (14–16).","[862, 863, 864, 865, 866]"
"The particle is used before a subordinate copula clause as a device for
switching attention to a different topical referent (‘as for . . .’), e.g.  (15) k6má t-íle Rùstam,} ""áw mbaqór6lle T>tár-i Slemán-i Sêndi.} ‘As for Rustam,

       (A28:29)Occasionally the particle is used to introduce a temporal clause. It is
attested in this function in both its full form and its abbreviated form ma-.
The temporal clause may have generic (‘whenever’) or specific reference
(‘when’), e.g.  (17) k6m•t ""áw6ð náša x6lmêtta,} hár béna xaràye} mxáy6lle l-máre dìye.} ‘When-

       the king had read the letter, he said “Good!” ’ (A11:18)19.3.6. hatxa
The particle hatxa, which can function as a modifier of a nominal in the
sense of ‘such a’ (§14.9.15.), occasionally governs a content clause, e.g.  (1)   šuréla mßawò°e} hátxa t-ix-mßawó°e ""àxni.} ‘She began to talk just as
        we are speaking.’ (A19:2)19.3.7. qam
Clauses that are complements of this particle contain the irrealis verb
forms qa†6l and qa†6lwa, since they refer to an event that has not yet taken
place from the perspective of the verb in the main clause. The subordinate
clause may be placed either before or after the main clause. Examples:  (1)   qam-t-à°i,} mpál6†le m6n-hàbsa.} ‘Before they return, release him from
        prison.’ (A26:72)
  (2)   qam-š5ríwa bnàya,} y-azíwa y-oðíwa ""atùna.} ‘Before they began build-

Subordinate content clauses introduced by the preposition ba°6r ‘after’ or its
shorter variant (m-)bar are generally placed before the main clause, e.g.  (1)   m-bár t-y-óði núra gàwe,} xáy6m ràba.} ‘After they put fire in it, it heats
        up a lot.’ (B6:48)

       house was finished, in order to go to find her clothes.’ (A14:99)In (13) the clause introduced by the preposition bar has a causal sense:  (13) bár q6m-amr•tla ""anna-xabráne ""êlli} q6m-paqðêtli} hátxa t-óð6n b-xàbrux
       ‘Since you have said these things to me and have given me instruc-
       tions, I’ll do as you say.’ (A8:50)19.3.9. hal, ha-
When these two particles govern subordinate content clauses, they have
the same functions, but their syntax is different, in that ha- is regularly
992                             chapter nineteencombined with the subordinator D, but this is generally omitted after hal.
Their functions can be classified as follows. The form ha- is most likely
a shortened form of the Arabic particle ˙attà and hal has developed by
combining ha- with the preposition l-.19.3.9.1. ‘until’
In most cases subordinate clauses with these particles express an action
that marks the endpoint of an action expressed in a preceding main clause
and is to be translated by English ‘until’, e.g.  (1) mxéla l-©ðàðe} ha-t-†¬á°na mìtla.} ‘They beat one another until the three
      of them died.’ (A22:35)
  (2) p7š6t k•sli làxxa,} ""u-mxam•nnux ha-t-á°ya taj6rú°6t bábux láxxa xá-ga xèta.}
      ‘Stay with me here and I shall look after you until the merchants
      of your father come here again.’ (A14:61)
  (3) kazíwa prám6lla har-pal†ìwa,} hál plí†la hàtxa.} ‘They tried to cut them
      down, but they kept growing up, until they grew like this.’ (A38:15)
  (4) zílela hal-m•†yela l-qàßra,} r6š-qàßra.} ‘They went until they arrived at the
      palace, on top of the palace.’ (A24:49)If the preceding action is a perfective, punctual event, the ‘until’–clause
explicitly signals that its event is temporally posterior to what precedes, e.g.  (5) ""o-qamáya miràle,} ""o-t-tré miràle,} ha-t-m†éle gárra ""•lle dìye.} ‘The first one
      told him (his case), the second one told him, until his turn came.’
      (A17:31)In some cases the preceding action does not necessarily end with the
action of the ‘until’–clause but only reaches a particular point in its
progression, e.g.  (6)   °éle tàlga,} °éle, °éle, °èle,} há-t kléle zàga} t-r6š-‘àdra.} ‘More and more
        snow fell, until the bell that was over the tent stopped (ringing).’
        (A25:41)Conversely, after a negated clause, the ‘until’–clause marks the point at
which the action that was negated finally takes place. Note that the t- prefix
after hal in (8) should be interpreted as the future particle rather than the
homophonous subordinating particle, e.g.
                    syntactic subordination of clauses                       993  (7)   là humm•nne.} ha-t-xazèla} bráta °àya.} ‘He did not believe it, until he
        saw the girl coming.’ (A26:79)
  (8)   là-pal†6t,} hal-t-amr•nnux plù†gena.} ‘Do not come out, until I say to
        you “Come out!” ’ (A14:67)The particle hal is often combined with adverbial temporal expressions such
as ""5-g6t ‘the time that’, ""5-dan6t ‘the time that’, ""o-yom6t ‘the day that’, e.g.  (9)  ""u-""áyya har-šaqláwa m6n-d-àn šíše} mattàwa} ""•lla dìya} hál ""7-g6t q6m-
       qa†làla.} ‘She (the daughter-in-law) was constantly taking the iron
       bars and putting them into her, until she killed her.’ (A19:6)
  (10) ya-""àlaha,} háwe ßáxi hál-""5-g6t ""ána má†y6n ""•lle dìye.} ‘Oh God, let him
       be well until I reach him.’ (A26:80)
  (11) m6n-d-7-dan6t brèla} hál d-5-dán6t m†éla l-yàla,} wéla bxàya.} ‘From the
       time she was born until the time that she came to the boy she
       wept.’ (A25:4)
  (12) pálx6t k•sli hal-d-o-yóm6 qárya tòke.} ‘Work with me until the day when
       the toke bird sings.’ (A30:3)19.3.9.2. ‘before’
When the event in the main clause is perfective and is completed before
the inception of the event in the subordinate clause, the appropriate
translation of the particle is sometimes ‘before’ rather than ‘until’. The
crucial factor is the information status of the subordinate clause. If the
subordinate clause is assertive the translation is ‘until’. If, however, it is
factive, i.e. it is presupposed that the hearer accepts it as a fact, it is more
idiomatically translated by ‘before’. In many cases such factive clauses are
placed before the asserted main clause, e.g.  (1)   ha-t-""á°e ""o-náša qamàya} má†e l-""ˆna} ""á°e xa-náša sàwa.} ‘Before the
        first man reached the spring, an old man came.’ (A15:3)
  (2)   ha-t-íle ""ê°ya,} mpulá††5la f9qih.} ‘Before he came back, she took out
        the jurist.’ (A22:39)
  (3)   zílela náš6t mà°a,} ""ína ha-t-íla zìle náš6t má°a,} ""o-núra óêmy5le.} ‘The
        people of the village went (to help), but before the people of the
        village arrived, the fire was put out.’ (A48:3)Occasionally the factive subordinate clause is placed after the main
clause, e.g.
994                             chapter nineteen  (4) ""6n-°éla píšla x9†ar ""•llux qúrba,} dríla ""an-bóóe l-""9ra,} q7mi tre-xóre t-ásq6t
      rèša} párq6t xàyux,} bálki ""6n-šálla hal-""5-g6-má†a ""àrye.} ‘If danger comes
      near to you, put these two seeds in the ground and two poplar trees
      will grow up, which you can climb and perhaps save your life before
      the lions arrive.’ (A18:14)19.3.9.3. ‘until when’
Occasionally the clause introduced by the particle is presented as being
connected in sense to a greater degree with what follows it. The effect of
this is that it expresses an action that is the endpoint of what precedes
but at the same time the starting point of what follows. In such contexts
the appropriate English translation is often ‘until when. . . .’, e.g.  (1) klèle} hal-tímla †¬á°a yomà°a} Rust8mo ‰ìšle.} ‘He stood until when three
      days had passed, Rustam awoke.’ (A29:22)
  (2) há-t-ila prìqe} ß•lyela gu-gallìya-w} P•tto d•ry5le tòpe.} ‘Until when they
      had finished coming down the valley, P6tto fired his gun.’ (B19:7)
  (3) kut-yáwna maxêtla.} máx6tla yàwna,} ""aw-yaßíla xéna xaðêr-6llux.} mára há-t
      ""ánna šáwwa yawná°a qa†lêtla,} mára qáßra kàle.} ‘ “Hit each dove. Hit a dove
      and another corner will turn round towards you.” ’ He said “Until
      when you have killed the seven doves, the palace will stop.” ’ (A12:25)
  (4) là-pal†6t,} hal-t-amr•nnux plù†gena} ""ˆ-ga pál†6t.} ‘Do not come out, until when
      I say to you “Come out!”, at that time you should come out.’ (A14:67)19.3.9.4. Purpose
The particle ha- is sporadically used with a purposive sense, as in (1), in
which it is combined with the particle qa-:  (1) ""í°wale xa-kàrma.} zríy6nwale b-i°à°i} ""u-ráb6nwa k‘íxa bíye dìye.} ha-t-qa-
      mam†•nna †únte dìye.} ‘He had an orchard. (He said) “I had cultivated
      it with my hands and toiled greatly in it in order to make it produce
      its fruit.” ’ (A17:32)19.3.10. †la-, ta-19.3.10.1. Purpose and Result
Subordinate clauses introduced by this preposition generally have a deontic
modality and express purpose, their action being presented as unrealized
from the perspective of the main clause, e.g.
                    syntactic subordination of clauses                          995  (1) mšaxnánne ""ixàla} ta-t-áxl6x ""ána-w ""áti m-©ðàðe.} ‘I shall heat the food so
      that you and I may eat together.’ (A22:31)
  (2) d•ry5le xˆla} ta-t-šarê†la gáne.} ‘He struggled in order to release himself.’
      (A26:81)
  (3) ""áwwa †éni páy6š n†ìra} ta-t-‘ú-mdi là-""a°e bíye dìye.} ‘This saddle bag will
      be guarded so that nothing will happen to it.’ (A7:9)Occasionally the D subordinator is omitted. This is attested mostly where
the preposition has its longer form †la, e.g.","[1028, 1029, 1030, 1031, 1032, 1033, 1034]"
"0.2.5. Influence from Other Languages
The Assyrian Christians of Barwar spoke in addition to their NENA dia-
lect also Kurdish and Arabic. Kurdish was the language of the Muslim
population in the Barwar region. Arabic was spoken in the Iraqi towns
and was the language of school education.
   The influence from the Iranian language Kurdish has been particularly
extensive. There are numerous features of the NENA dialect that exhibit
parallels with Kurdish and appear to be the result of borrowing and
convergence. The high degree of Kurdish influence on the lexicon of the
dialect is reflected by its large stock of Kurdish loanwords in all gram-
matical categories (nouns, verbs and particles). All the verbs and many
of the nouns have been adapted to Aramaic inflectional morphology (for
further details see §20.1.2.2.).
   Also several features of phonological and grammatical structure appear
to have developed under the influence of Kurdish. In most cases these
are calques that imitate Kurdish but use NENA grammatical material.
                                   introduction                                      19Some examples of features that have parallels in Kurdish and are likely
to have arisen under its influence are the following:31(i) In the Kurdish dialects of the area the consonants /k/ and /g/ are
     palatalized before a following front vowel (Mackenzie 1961: 32) as is
     the case in the C. Barwar dialect (§1.2.1.)
(ii) In vocative expressions in Kurdish the stress shifts to the beginning
     of the word (Mackenzie 1961: 157). The same shift is found in C.
     Barwar nouns when used vocatively (§5.3.), e.g.
      Kurdish                  kú‰ìnô             ‘boys!’
      C. Barwar                ""álaha             ‘God!’(iii) A particle that is in origin the cardinal numeral ‘one’ is used to express
      indefiniteness of a noun in Kurdish. This structure is paralleled in the
      C. Barwar dialect in the use of the cardinal numeral with the same
      function (§14.1.):
       Kurdish                     C. Barwar
       mirôv-ak                    xa-gaw‰a          ‘a man’This indefinite particle is used in indefinite numerical expressions (Mack-
enzie 1961: 152) as is the case with the corresponding particle in the
C. Barwar dialect (§14.12.):      Kurdish                       C. Barwar
      ‘àr pènú daf 'a-kà            xa ""arba xamša gaye       ‘four or five times’      Kurdish                       C. Barwar
      ‘and ‰ô≥-akà                  xa-kma yome               ‘some days’(iv) The common Kurdish practice of forming compound adjectives by
     combining the preposition p with a noun (MacKenzie 1961:216) has a
     direct parallel in compounds in the C. Barwar dialect with the NENA
     preposition b-, e.g.","[57, 58]"
