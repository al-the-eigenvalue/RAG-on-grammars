To conclude, it should be noted that the word order as described by Drabbe
is not without exception. The text corpus does contain a number of
examples where the object precedes the subject. One of these cases is
presented below. Although the number of examples is too small to draw
any rigid conclusions on factors influencing word order, it is not unlikely
that in a case like (453) the initial position of the indirect object has to do
with its topicality. The sentence is about the two boys who have received
food (from a parrot), even though the two are not framed here as a subject
(which is the grammatical role that usually coincides with the pragmatic
role of topic (cf. footnote 202)).",[296]

The words are presented in alphabetical order, where the mutual order of
unmodified vowels, nasal vowels and long vowels is random. For example,
the order of ã, a and ā is random (all count as a). The same is true for the
mutual order of u and ü: both count as u. The consonant x ([x]) counts as
the English consonant x: it follows the consonant w and precedes z (y is not
attested in Aghu). Compounds directly follow the (first) word with which
they form a compound, so that e.g. a-müto is presented higher in the
alphabetical list than a word like abi.",[407]

      It should be noted that data are scarce at this point, however: Drabbe gives only one
example of a clause without an explicit ‘subject’. This example is similar to (, but has a
1SG verb form: de bade ‘I am sitting (there)’.
195
      The copula de may also be used with embedded verbal clauses, cf. 4.3.
4 Clause structure
This chapter discusses the structure of clauses. The focus of the chapter is
on main independent clauses: those clauses that can stand on their own, and
need not be followed by another clause in order to be grammatical; in Aghu
this category is formed by clauses headed by semifinite and finite verbs
(and nonverbal clauses). Some attention will also be given, however, to
clauses headed by nonfinite verbs. These clauses cannot stand on their own
and need to be followed by another clause in order to form a grammatical
sentence.","[288, 289]"

Another example of a deviating word order is the following. Here Drabbe
adds a footnote stating that this is not the normal word order and that the
translation should be as given below.200 His translation can be seen as a
clear indication that also here the deviating word order has to do with the
topicality of the object.","[296, 297]"

Drabbe writes that the normal order in clauses is subject, object, verb.
Expressions of time usually come in first position, while expressions of
place follow the subject. If we have two non-subject arguments, their
mutual order is free. According to Drabbe, the NP directly preceding the
verb receives more emphasis. Thus, in (450) below, it is emphasized that it
is ‘to my wife’ that the taro are given, more than what is given. Following
traditional terminology, Drabbe describes the recipient as the indirect object
and the gift as the direct object. We will follow Drabbe at this point.198198
      It should be noted that the terms subject, direct object and indirect object are generally
taken as indications of grammatical roles, which intermediate between semantic roles (like
Agent, Recipient) and pragmatic roles (like topic, focus, pragmatic pivot; cf. Andrews
2007). One should, therefore, have formal grammatical criteria to distinguish between
grammatical roles like direct object and indirect object, and not semantic criteria like
‘referring to a recipient’ versus ‘referring to the undergoer’. We have insufficient data,

In addition to order, the syntactic function of noun phrases (including
pronouns) may be indicated by case markers: the nominative marker te or
the accusative marker ke; That they should be analyzed as case markers is
further explained in 4.4. These markers are optional, and do not need to be
used when the function of the NP is clear from the context. Their precise
pragmatic function remains unclear. It is important to note, however, that
the use of te seems to be restricted to humans and larger animals: this is
stated explicitly by Drabbe for its use in non-verbal clauses, but might be
true for its use in verbal clauses too.199
however, to find these grammatical criteria. Moreover, many of these criteria, like
coreference relations in clause linking, can only be found out in fieldwork experiments, by
asking informants for grammaticality judgments etc. As this is not possible, it seems most
practical to follow Drabbe’s terminology, and use a loose semantic criterion to distinguish
between the two roles.
199
      Because Drabbe does not state this for verbal clauses, however, this is not more than an
assumption. The text corpus contains only two examples of nominative te (2.074 and
7.065), which happen to be cases of reference to humans.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure                                            277
A very good illustration of the optionality of case marking, taken from the
text corpus, is given in (452) below. In the first clause we find two overt
NP’s, neither of them marked for syntactic function (although eke ta has
exclusively been attested in subject position, cf. 3.2.3); apparently, their
function is clear from the context. In clause 2, we find only one overt NP,
in object function, not overtly marked as oblique. In clause 3 we again find
two overt NP’s, an indirect object: efe joxo ‘his brother’ and a direct object:
afitamã xabai ‘half a head’. In clause 4, finally, the non-subject role of efe
joxo is marked by the oblique marker ke, for unclear pragmatic reasons.","[293, 294, 295]"

      One might want to argue that -ku and -ne are clitics rather than suffixes, because they
can be attached to a wider range of verbs than most affixes, to verbs that do not need this

The language also has a category of nouns where we find alternation.
Especially for nouns referring to larger objects and trees, reference to

situation can be visualized as follows:Humans; larger animals; ?smaller animals; trees; larger objects; smaller objects; mass nouns 122

the respective category is not clear. The use of dashed instead of closed
lines indicates that the borders between the categories are not clear. In
sentence 10 below, for example, we find two nouns that refer to smaller
objects, which nevertheless combine with plural inflection. I would
hypothesize that here plural inflection is used because of the strong
association with animacy; it might even be that here the genitals, as it were,
represent or stand for the persons themselves.","[181, 182]"

      In fact, I get the strong impression that in most of the cases attested in the text corpus,
the function of the ‘quantifier’ is not to quantify or modify the noun. It seems rather the
case that the first noun presents the sentire set, after which the quantifier specifies a subset.
Thus, in many cases the rendering of the logical structure of the expression should be
something like ‘some of N’ or ‘all of N’, rather than ‘some N’ or ‘all N’.

Aghu has no word for ‘few’ that can be combined with count nouns.
Instead, one uses negated forms of words denoting ‘many’. In combination
with mass nouns, however, one may use patoxo. The word means ‘small’ in
combination with count nouns, and is used in combination with mass nouns
in order to denote a small quantity.","[278, 279]"

      The hypothesis that we have to do with grammaticalized forms which are no longer in a
productive relation to the shorter form is reinforced by the fact that the longer forms are no
longer fully predictable from the shorter forms, e.g. botu corresponds to boteaxa not
*botuaxa, and bodü corresponds to bodixa not *bodüaxa. We find the same axV and oxo in
the question words meoxo ‘who’ and makeaxe ‘what’, discussed in 3.2.5.1.

1. Drabbe makes a distinction between adverbs that modify adjectives and adverbs that
modify verbs. That certain adverbs may also serve to modify an other adverb, a clause /
sentence or another noun, has been added by Wilco van den Heuvel, on the basis of the
data attested in the corpus. The adverbs da, tafeaxa and xati are not mentioned by Drabbe
in his discussion of adverbs. 2. Drabbe is not consistent in rendering stress for this word,
which may indicate that it alternates. In this book, the form is consistently rendered as
isiomu, except when citing examples provided by Drabbe. 3. Xati seems to indicate the
repetition of an earlier event. It is also used in cases where the same event is performed on
a different object, e.g. in 2.094, where first some moldered wood is brought up, and now
(again / also) a stick. In such cases, we would use 'also' in English, instead of 'again'. This
might be seen as an indication that xati (in these cases) modifies the verb (only the
bringing up is modified), and not the entire clause (which includes the object).

3.4.1 Modifiers of adjectives
Drabbe 1957: section 75, p. 30a-bAs intensifiers of adjectives we find xajã ‘really’, püsiü ‘very’ or püsiüaxa
‘very’ and isiomu ‘very/all’, all of which Drabbe proposes to gloss as
‘very’. In all the examples provided by Drabbe, the adjectives are used
predicatively. Xajã ‘very’ and püsiü ‘very’ are also attested as adjectives:
xajã ‘real’ and püsiü ‘big’. Isiomu is placed before the adjective that it
modifies, while the other forms follow the adjective. As can be seen in
(307), the pre-adjectival and post-adjectival adverbs can also be combined.(306)       jafi            xajã /           jafi           püsiü /        isiom=       jafi
            beautiful       very             beautiful      very           very / all   beautiful
            ‘very beautiful’ (Drabbe 1957:30a)
(307)       Eŋge                    isiom’          jafi           püsiü   oxo.
            ẽ-ge                    isiom=          jafi           püsiü   oxo
            eat-N1.RLS[SG]          very/all        beautiful      very    COP
            ‘She eats and it is very good.’ (6.225)
Isiom= has a wider distribution than the other intensifiers, and can also be
used to modify a verb (or another adverb).163 In order to catch all these
adverbial uses, I have chosen to consistently gloss it as ‘very/all’.(308)       isiòmu        da-xe-nã
            very/all      come-N1.RLS-N1PL
            ‘they all came’ (Drabbe 1957:29b)
(309)      nu        isiom=          üfü-oxe
           1SG       very/all        hit-N1.RLS[SG]
           ‘he hit me very hard’ (Drabbe 1957:30a)163
      Drabbe writes that isiomu can also be used in combination with adverbs, but does not
give an example.
214                         PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes(310)   isiom=      tadixa      ke        de
        very/all    big         FOC       COP
        ‘it is very big’ (Drabbe 1957:29b)
(311)   isiom=       kisièmu    küŋ-ge
        very/all     real        die-N1.RLS[SG]
        ‘he really really died’ (Drabbe 1957:30a)
One could also argue that in cases like (308) isiomu is not so much
modifying the verb, but rather the covert subject of the verb. This could be
taken as an argument to analyze the forms in cases like these as indefinite
numerals (modifying the covert subject) rather than as adverbs. In this
context it is relevant to compare (308) above to (312) below. In both cases,
the gloss is a literal translation of the gloss given by Drabbe, where the
gloss in (312) shows that Drabbe sees the form as an indefinite numeral.
This is in line with Drabbe’s earlier section on numerals, where he
describes isiomu as an indefinite numeral, used — like other numerals — in
postnominal position. Although Drabbe may very well be right, I believe
that — given the analogy to (308) — it is still possible to analyze isiomu as
an adverb. This is expressed by the second gloss.(312)    axu       isiom=       da-xe-nã
         human     very/all     come-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘all people came’ (Drabbe 1957:29b) / ‘the people all came’ (my alternative
         interpretation)
We find something of the same ambiguity between an analysis as an adverb
or as indefinite numeral in the two following examples, which are part of
one and the same narrative. As Drabbe does not give a sentence-by
sentence translation in his textual corpus, the translations are more guided
by my own interpretation than in (308) and (312) above. The sentences are
part of a passage where a younger brother is located in a house. His older
brother comes flying to this house, and bumps into it when trying to get in.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                                              215
In (313) it is worded how, because of this, his head gets crushed entirely.
Here, the position of isiom= does not allow for an analysis as an indefinite
numeral, as it is not in a postnominal position.","[229, 230, 231, 232, 233]"
"
In Aghu, there is a split in behavior between singular and 1PL experiencer-
arguments on the one hand, and N1 plural arguments on the other hand.
When the relevant argument belongs to the first category, the language uses
an ‘experiential construction’, which reflects the semantic nature of the
experiencer as being more closely associated with objects than with
subjects. The verb has (impersonal) 3SG inflection, while the argument is
optionally marked as accusative, by the use of the postpositional case
marker ke ‘ACC’. This is illustrated in (455) below. When the argument is
N1 plural, however, it behaves as a normal subject in a normal verbal
clause: the subject is optionally marked as nominative by the use of te,
while verbal inflection is N1PL, showing agreement with the subject. This is
illustrated in (456).",[298]
"
In verbal clauses, pronouns and noun phrases can be followed by one of the
case markers te or ke (or kèmu / kumu, see 3.6.2 below). Te ‘NOM’ is
optionally used to mark a subject, while ke ‘ACC’ may be used to mark the
object. In this book I will use the term object for those constituents that can
be marked with ke and which bear the semantic role of patient, beneficiary
or target. In addition, ke may be used to mark a location or a temporal
expression, although we hardly have any examples of the latter use. 135
Although te and ke belong to the class of postpositional case markers that
will be discussed in 3.6, the fact that they mark the central syntactic
functions of subject and object justifies an additional discussion here. Te
and ke may be seen as having a disambiguating function, as they can easily
be left out when the context makes clear what is intended. Compare the
following examples, where the interpretation of (221a) is dependent on the
context and allows for different readings out of context, but ( b) and ( c )135
      In fact, the only example is the expression womiŋ ge / gèmu ‘in the night’ provided by
Drabbe in his discussion on kèmu, kumu and ke (Drabbe 1957:42a). Cf. 3.6.2 below.

respectively.(221a)   na        n-amse               ed-oxe-nã
         1SG.POS   LNK-child            give-N1.RLS-N1PL

         1SG.POS   LNK-child       ACC      give-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
While in transitive sentences like ( b) the use of te may be seen as
disambiguating, this cannot explain the use of te in intransitive sentences, as
in (222) below.(222)    na        n-amse          te       da-xe-nã
         1SG.POS   LNK-child       NOM      come-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘my children have come’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
Most probably, the case marker ke is historically related to the
homophonous marker ke that is used to mark focused subjects and
complements in nominal clauses, cf. section 4.4.

3.2 Pronouns3.2.1 Independent pronouns and emphatic pronouns:
      form
Drabbe 1957: section 11-12, p. 6a-7aThe forms of the free pronouns are as follows. Their function will be
discussed in detail below, but it is relevant to note here that the use of efe
and joxo is restricted to humans and animals, except when the former is
used as possessive pronoun in the construction described in 3.1.2.","[193, 194, 195]"
"Summary of 4.42 to 4.66. Then they fell a tree, to make a canoe out of it. After seven
days the canoe is ready. They spend another day to clear up a path, and lay sleepers on
it. The next day the canoe is drawn into the water, and is test sailed.
Drabbe uses the word 'dwarsliggers', which translates into English as
'sleepers'. In Dutch the word is used for railway sleepers or railroad
crossties, which by the time of Drabbe’s publication were usually made
out of wood. From the context it can be concluded that the people who
made the canoe lay small trees or sticks across the road in order to draw
the canoe over them next day.

the one used in this publication can often be found through the use of a

           (6.202)4.1.1 Experiential clauses
Drabbe 1957: section 60, p. 23b-24aLike many Papuan languages, 201 Aghu has a number of ‘experiential verbs’,
which are listed below. Semantically, these verbs have at least one
200
      “En de spullen, die neemt de vrouw over” (Drabbe 1957:87, note 127).
201
      It is Drabbe (1957:23b) who points out that most Papuan languages have a class of
verbs that are used ‘eventively’, where the logical subject functions as grammatical object.
Foley (1986:121f) points out that many Papuan languages have impersonal constructions in
which the animate participant functions as a passive, non-controlling undergoer. Although
Foley focuses on languages where these impersonal constructions function to distinguish
between controlled and uncontrolled events, these impersonal constructions are formally
very similar to the experiential constructions that we find in Aghu. De Vries (2006:814)
discusses experiential constructions in the light of ‘thematizing preferences in Papuan
languages’. He argues that the impersonal constructions involving experiential topics in
Kombai and Inanwatan may have developed out of expressions in which the experiencer-
topic formed a syntactically non-integrated part of the sentence, which became
intonationally and syntactically integrated into a conventional clause structure. For
experiential verbs in Kombai see de Vries and Wiersma (1992:16).

argument, which can best be characterized as (subtype of the category of)
experiencer: it is sentient, not instigating the event, and affected by the
event. Pragmatically, this experiencer is the topic, representing what the
sentence is about. On the basis of its pragmatics, therefore, one would
expect it to be realized as a subject, as there is a strong association between
‘being the subject’ and ‘being the (sentential) topic’. 202 Semantically,
however, the experiencer deviates from the prototypical semantic properties
associated with subjects (sentient, but instigating and not affected), and is
actually closer to the semantic prototype of objects. 203 This section
describes the solution developed in the Aghu language to deal with this
tension.","[297, 298]"

          ‘They gives him mi-bananas and he takes them.’ (5.19)
While most sentences in Aghu lack an overt subject (cf. below), the subject
is also frequently expressed by a coreferent NP preceding the verb, to
which we will refer as the subject-NP or — briefly — the (overt) subject.
An example of such an overt subject is gõ ‘blood’ in the example below.
Although Drabbe writes that it is also possible to use overt free pronouns as
subjects, he does not give any examples for verbal clauses.196(444)     Gõ        mike.
          gõ        mi-ke
          blood     come.down-N1.RLS[SG]
          ‘Blood comes down.’ (1.012)
Clauses may be intransitive, transitive or ditransitive. Analogous to what
we saw for subjects above, objects may be left out if their identity is clear
from the context. This is in line with a general distributive tendency in
many Papuan languages for the verb to occur without any associated
nominals at all (cf. Foley 1986:70, cited in de Vries 2005:813), and with the
observation by de Vries that many Papuan languages “have little room for
nouns and pronouns to track given, active referents” (2006:183). Consider
the following passage. In (446) we first find the intransitive clause xodok,
196
      In the text corpus, the only examples of free pronouns in subject position are pronouns
followed by ke ta ‘FOC IN.TURN’; focused 3SG pronouns were described 3.2.3.2
274                                   PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure
where the identity of the subject is clear from the preceding clause with an
explicit efe namoko as its subject. Then follows a transitive wi tiŋge with
wi ‘pig’ as the object. In (447) we find the same verb tĩ, but now without an
explicit object, as the identity of the object is clear from the preceding

      It is clear from their meaning that these clauses, which lack overt objects, should
nevertheless be considered transitive. It is outside the scope of this book, however, to
discuss the precise conditions under which sentences which lack an overt object may be
called transitive.

In addition to the adnominal cases of xo discussed above, we find only one
case of another demonstrative pronoun that is used adnominally:(249)      Bũ     dadek            Soxo-Kaŋgõ-Büʃü              nego     manumusuke.

Examples of pronominal use are manifold. Drabbe exemplifies the
following four uses, not meant to be exhaustive. The different uses will be
illustrated below, in reverse order.",[211]
"
3.2.3 Free (and possessive) pronouns: distributionIf we want to discuss the use of free pronouns and possessive pronouns, the
first thing to be noted is that the great majority of verbal clauses in Aghu
lack overt free pronouns; they are used only for special rhetorical purposes.
Second it should be noted that Drabbe’s text corpus is highly biased in that
it contains very few examples of direct speech. This makes it very hard to
make a comparison between the use of 3rd person pronouns and the use of
1st and 2nd person pronouns. At this point it suffices to follow Drabbe’s
description, who states:
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                                          181“Nu and nugu [1st person, WvdH] are not often used as subject of a verbal clause, as in
such sentences the person is clear from subject inflection on the verb. The 2 nd and 3rd
person pronouns are attested more frequently, as verb inflection does not distinguish
between 2nd and 3rd person, but when it is clear from the context which person is intended
they are often left out. Efe never appears without ke or te, neither as subject, nor as object,
nor as predicate in nominal clauses. When te is used one says efe te. With ke the two are
contracted into eke. Eke is sometimes also used as subject.”","[198, 199]"
"
3.1.5.5 Associative pluralNouns referring to larger animals and human beings are often followed by a
3rd person free pronoun, which indicates not only the number of the noun
phrase, but, according to Drabbe, also implies definiteness, to which we
will come back below. He gives the following examples:(212)      xobasĩ         joxo          te               da-xe-nã
           men            3PL           NOM              come-N1.RLS-N1PL
           ‘the men have come’ (Drabbe 1957:5b)

           ‘the cuscus animals jumped from branch to branch’ (Drabbe 1957:5b)
In addition to the single example of joxo modifying a non-subject NP,
given in note 123 above, and in addition to the cases where it is used as
part of a possessive construction (see 3.1.2 above), the text corpus contains
ten examples of joxo modifying or following a subject NP.127 In some of
these cases, the NP plus pronoun refer to ‘a person and others associated
with this person’, so that we have to do with an ‘associative plural’:
127
      These are 1.092, 1.137, 1.183, 1.271, 2.162, 6.055, 7.003, 8.014, 8.020, 8.022.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                                        171(214)        axu      jobu           nisi       joxo    xoxenã.

             ‘(...) the man with the poke and his helpers go out’ (8.014)
The text corpus also contains an example of an associative plural where the
subject is not followed by joxo:(215)      Atumio        büsiü       baxenã.
           Atumio        büsiü       ba-xe-nã
           Atumio        house       sit-N1.RLS-N1PL
           ‘Atumio and his clan mates live in a settlement.’ (5.02)3.1.5.6 Verbs implying plurality of subject or object
Plurality can also be implied by the verb, in the sense that iterative verbs
(see 2.4.1) often imply a plural object. Examples given by Drabbe are wi
saxa [shoot.IT pig] ‘shoot pigs’ and büsiü sigumùdu [house build.IT] ‘build
houses’, which refer to repetitive shooting and building, respectively, and
therefore (in most contexts) imply plural objects. In at least two cases we
have a suppletive iterative verb implying a plural subject: kü ̃ is the neutral
word for ‘die’, which may have a singular or a plural subject (e.g. 1.300
and 2.149, respectively), while suppletive iterative xani ‘die.IT’ implies a
plural subject (e.g. 2.105). Analogously, we find kunum’ i(g) ‘sleep’ with
either singular or plural subject, and kunũ xanda(x) ‘sleep.IT’ implying a
plural subject.128
128
      The form is attested in 2.2, where Drabbe adds that it combines with a plural subject,
and in sentence 5.28 of the tekst corpus.
172                         PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
3.1.6 Definiteness
Drabbe 1957: section 62, p. 24b; section 9, p. 5a-bAs stated in the introductory part of 3.1.5, Aghu NP’s do not need to be
specified for definiteness. However, Drabbe mentions two formatives that
imply a definite reading. First, when dealing with demonstrative
pronouns,129 he writes that the demonstrative pronoun xo ‘DST’.“often has no other function than that of a definite article, e.g. amoko xo da-xe [boy DST
come-N1.RLS[SG]]‘the boy has come’, and is also used as such with proper names, e.g.
Pemagha gho bagidi dafine P will come tomorrow.” 130
In the text corpus, demonstrative xo is attested once in text 1, repeatedly in
text 2, and repeatedly in text 6; in all cases the demonstrative is indeed
glossed by Drabbe as a definite article. In my opinion, Drabbe’s discussion
of the demonstrative and the examples attested in the texts — which will be
shown below — may indeed be taken as an indication that the
demonstrative xo is developing into a definiteness marker, a development
which is cross-linguistically very common (cf. Diesel 1999:128). 131 The
example from text 1 is given here as (216).","[188, 189, 190]"
"217
      Nominal clauses with meoxo as a subject were discussed in 3.2.5.1.
302                             PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure(525)      xo      ke            n-eto         de
           DST     FOC/*ACC      1SG-father    COP
           ‘that one over there is my father’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)
Turning to the use of ke with a complement, its analysis as a focus marker
again makes more sense than the analysis as a case marker. This is mainly
because in non-verbal clauses we cannot find a grammatical opposition
between the use of ke and the use of te as we found in verbal clauses.
Examples of the use of ke marking a complement are found in (464)-(467)
above, the last of which has been copied here as (526).218(526)      Wi       ke         de
           pig      FOC        COP
           ‘it’s a pig’ (Drabbe 1957:8b)
The analysis of ke as a focus marker is supported by other contexts where
ke is best analyzed as such. We also find ke in the subject position of
verbal clauses, always in combination with a free pronoun, and often
followed by ta. This was discussed extensively in Chapter 3; the use of eke,
a cliticized form efe ‘3SG’ plus ke ‘FOC’, was discussed in 3.2.3.2, while the
use of ke ‘FOC’ in combination with other pronouns came along in the
218
      Dixon (2010b:159 f.) refers to copula as copula verbs and to the predicate as the copula
complement. He writes that cross-linguistically copula complements are often not case-
marked at all. He also points out, however, that we find other possibilities, like some
Eastern European languages where copula complements can be marked either with
nominative, or with oblique case, dependent on the nature of the relation: permanent or
temporary (ibid: 170). From a functional point of view, it is not so surprising that a copula
complement can be marked either way: it has the same referent as the subject-topic, but
generally refers to an object that is affected, which is typical for objects. In Aghu we find
all three possibilities: no marking, marking with a a nominative marker te (which usually
marks subjects), and marking with a focus marker ke, possibly historically related to an
accusative marker ke (which usually marks objects).

discussion of the marker ta (3.7.1 and 3.2.3.2). The following examples,
presented in Chapter 3 as (233) and (400), respectively, illustrate this use.","[319, 320, 321]"
"Although these conditions do seem to hold in Aghu, I would like to add
another, formal criterion: in the data available to us, the great majority of
semifinite clauses with SS interpretation are followed by a break, indicated
by a comma, a semicolon or a temporal expression like bagidi ‘next day’.249
248
      “Ziehier een ander voorb.: jã bodo kutofidik tümoghe, ghabã tümoghe hij legde (de
verslagene) op een boomtak en sneed af, hij sneed het hoofd af; ghabã tümoghe kan men
beschouwen als een nieuwe zin, waarin de verteller uitleg geeft van het voorafgaande.”
249
      We restrict ourselves to sequences of verbs within one and the same sentence. Examples
of semifinites with same subject separated by ba-gidi sit-next.day — which marks the end
of a clause chain — are plenty. The following list forms only a small part: 1.016, 1.017,
1.019, 1.021, 1.023, 1.025 (...) 1.116. Some of the few exceptions to the strong tendency
334                          PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 5: Clause combinations
If we recall that clause chains are defined as clauses demarcated by pauses,
we must conclude that — within the definition that we use in this book —
these semifinites belong to different clause chains, although they are part of
the same sentence. We can still state, therefore, that sequences of
semifinites within a clause chain imply DS; over clause chains, however,
they may be used in SS conditions. This is only possible, however, if the
conditions (a) and (b) given above are answered. In other words, in order
for a sequence of semifinite verbs within one sentence to be interpreted as
having the same subject, separation by a pause is a necessary, but not a
sufficient condition.250
Sentences (570) through (572), all taken from the text corpus, form a good
illustration of these ‘inter-clause-chain’ but intra-sentential sequences of
semifinites. The relevant verb forms have been printed in bold. First
consider (570). The sequence of memoxenã ‘they continue (placing)’ anddescribed above are the following (these are intra-clause-chain semifinites referring to the
same subject): 2.150, 2.173 (where we find two semifinites separated by dateke. If we take
dateke as a temporal expression analogous to bagidi, however, we might also state that it
introduces a new clause chain, which would make the relation between the two verbs inter-
clause-chainal rather than intra-clause-chainal), last two verbs of 5.16.
250
      This means that the text corpus also contains examples of DS forms within one sentence
separated by a pause. A clear example is found in 5.16, presented here, where we find a
switch of subject between afamoxe and ogüke and again between ogüke and sibumoxe.
Between sibumoxe and kifioxe there is no change of subject:
Xati       woki        fe      to          afamoxe,               sia
xati       woki        fe      to          afam-oxe               sia

daxenã ‘they come’ answers criterion (a): the verbs express sequential
actions that have no temporal overlap. The sequence of daxenã and daxenã
is seen as an instance of condition (b): the second clause forms a
specification of the first. We see something similar in the repetition of the
verb bimoxenã in (571): the second clause specifies that it is the front of the
body that is cut open. The sequence of bimoxenã and afogioxenã in the
same sentence is probably best explained as expressing two events that have
no overlap, although it is also possible to read the second clause as a
specification or explanation of the first.","[351, 352, 353]"

3.1 Nouns and noun phrasesAghu has very few morphological processes operating on nouns. The only
ones are: (1) plural suffixation, on a very restricted set of kinship terms and
nouns denoting humans (3.1.5.1), and (2) suffixation with a possessive
linker, on vowel-initial nouns in possessive constructions (3.1.2; 3.2.2).
There are no productive processes of noun formation, except from
compounding, which is the topic of the following section.107
3.1.1 Compounding
Drabbe 1957: section 7, p. 4a-bThe Aghu language has two types of nominal compounds, illustrated in the
following figure. In both constructions, the modifying noun has main
stress.108

1 are found in “all Papuan languages”, and that they are also found in the Germanic
languages.

Cross-linguistically, in compounds the exact semantic relation between the
constituents is often a matter of interpretation by the language user (Booij
2005:75). Language users have to interpret the relationship on the basis of
the meaning of the composing parts, their knowledge of the world, and
sometimes on the basis of the context. At the same time, one may think of
certain types of compounds as imposing a ‘semantic scheme’ on the
composing parts and or on the resultant meaning. This scheme may be
rather loose, and put only few restrictions on the possible range of
constituents, or rather strict, allowing only for certain constituents, and
specifying the semantic relation between the parts as well as the meaning of
the whole. If we compare the two types of compounds in Aghu, it seems
that those of type 2 are more specific or answer to a stricter scheme than
those of type 1. For compounds of type 2, Drabbe gives the following three
subtypes, with a strictly defined range of possible constituents — fillers of
the N1 and N2 positions in the figure below — and a strictly defined
relation between the two composing parts. . Drabbe is not explicit about the
question whether the modifying elements in these compounds are also
attested as separate words.

inflected verbs depend for their interpretation on the next fully inflected
verb to their right, but are at the same time not a constituent of the clause
containing the fully inflected verb. Following Foley (2010), these clauses
are probably better characterized as coordinate rather than subordinate.223223
      It is not so easy to prove, however, that the dependent clauses in Aghu are coordinate
rather than subordinate. According to Foley (2010), subordinate clauses are always
constituents of the main clause: either as a core argument, in which case they are
complement clauses; or as oblique arguments, in which case they are adverbial subordinate
clauses, or as modifier of a nominal constituent, in which case they are relative clauses.
One could state, therefore, that subordinate clauses, are ‘nominalized’, or — generally —
formally marked as noun phrases.
While in certain other Awyu-Dumut languages dependent clauses can be contrasted with
subordinate structures in which the clause is nominalized (cf. Wester 2014: 158 f.; de Vries
2005:372-377), this is not the case in Aghu; it is impossible to use language-internal
criteria to contrast the dependent clauses under discussion here with subordinate clauses.
Still, it makes more sense to consider them coordinate rather than subordinate. The main
reasons for this are the following: (1) There is simply no evidence that the clauses are
embedded in the following clause with fully inflected verb, and there is no evidence that
the clauses are nominalized (unless we follow Drabbe’s analysis of ke, see below); (2)
Drabbe never translates the dependent clauses in Aghu as complement clauses or relative
clauses, which — as stated by Foley 2010:32 — are typical functions of subordinate
clauses in Papuan languages. Although it is true that translations can never be taken as
evidence for the existence or non-existence of a certain grammatical construction, I
nevertheless believe that the total lack of relative and complement clauses in the Dutch
translation is telling; (3) although Drabbe refers to the nonfinite forms as deelwoorden

5.4 Aghu and switch referenceAs stated in the previous section, switch reference systems typically appear
in clause-chaining languages. As argued in de Vries (2010), who modifies a
theory set out in in Haiman and Munro (1983), clause chaining structures
are the result of coordination reduction in thematic continuity conditions,
where the basic principle is that those operators that are consistent over the
clauses are marked only on the verb of the final clause. De Vries shows
how, for Dumut languages, reduction took place in a diachronic process, in
cases where the operators of tense, mood and subject of a series of clauses
were continuous. In this process, verbs in SS conditions were the first to be
reduced and to become part of a chaining structure. Present Dumut
languages show the traces of this diachronic process: All Dumut languages
have dedicated nonfinite SS forms, which lack a specification for tense,
mood and person, while only some have dedicated DS forms. These DS
forms have grown from the non-reduced forms when used as non-final verb
in a series of clauses; as the use of reduced forms was restricted to SS
conditions, the non-reduced forms came to be associated with DS conditions.
In Dumut languages, then, we find (apart from the tensed forms which
(‘participles’), he places the words in apostrophes to show that they are different from
participles. The difference may very well be that participles are embedded while nonfinites
are not; (4) There are very clear cases where nonfinite clauses present foreground
information, e.g. in the durative constructions discussed in Durative aspect expressed by
constructions with posture verbs and at the end of 5.4.1.1. This is very unusual for
subordinate structures (cf. Dooley 2010). With regard to the first point, it should be noted
that the connective =k that is optionally used after nonfinites is considered by Drabbe the
same as the oblique marker ke used after nouns. Although it cannot be excluded that there
is a diachronic connection between the two particles, I believe that the two particles
synchronically have very different functions. The use of =k after nonfinite verbs cannot
be used, therefore, as an argument that the nonfinite clause would have been nominalized,
and that it would, therefore, be in a subordinate relation to the final clause.

largely function at discourse level, as in Aghu) reduced SS forms, and less
reduced semifinite verbs functioning in DS conditions.224
Coming back to Aghu, we find a somewhat paradoxical situation. On the
one hand, we find switch reference expressed in a way that is very much in
line with the patterns described above. We find a very frequent use of
reduced nonfinite forms in SS conditions, described in 5.4.1.1, while the less
reduced semifinite forms are used predominantly in DS conditions, as
described in 5.4.1.2. This system is very similar to the situation in South
Wambon, which de Vries characterizes as representing the first stage of a
development towards dedicated switch reference systems (de Vries
2010:345). On the other hand, switch reference can also be expressed by
the addition of suffixes to the less-reduced semifinite forms, a system that is
described in 5.4.2. Although this system is discussed by Drabbe rather
extensively, the text corpus contains very few examples of the use of the
respective affixes. The affixes express both switch reference and
sequentiality. The system is very different from the system discussed above,
because neither the SS nor the DS forms are reduced forms. On the contrary,
switch reference forms are more complex than ‘normal’ verbs, as they
result from the addition of suffixes.","[330, 331, 332]"

Before we go deeper into to the distributional properties of verbal nouns,
first some words need to be devoted to their semantics. If we take a verb
with a basic lexical meaning X, a verbal noun formed from lexeme X
usually refers to ‘the activity or event of X-ing’. With certain verbs,
however, the verbal noun may also refer to what Drabbe calls the result of a
process (1957:15), or to what could tentatively be called the ‘effected49
     That stems in e have verbal nouns in ã or ẽ with different distribution raises the question
whether it wouldn’t make more sense to speak of two types of ‘verbal nouns’ with
different function. For stems in e these two types would then be distinguished formally,
while for stems that end in other vowels the types would have no formal distinction.
Before deciding to reanalyze Drabbe’s data at this point, one would first have to consider
the question whether the alternation between ã and ẽ could not be explained on the basis of
the phonological environment in which the two alternants are used (vowel harmony, stress
pattern). As the data are too limited to investigate the influence of the phonological
environment, however, I have decided to follow Drabbe’s analysis.
50
     More precisely, Drabbe speaks of ‘nominal use of the future stem’. Drabbe’s formulation
betrays two aspects where the analysis here differs from his: (1) where he speaks of future
stems, we speak of irrealis stems or stems of type II; (2) for Drabbe, the forms under
discussion coincide with the stem, as for him the future stems or stems of type II discussed
in 2.2, Table 3, end in a nasal, cf. also footnote 33.

transitive verbs: ga noŋgã [2SG LNK-carve_II.VN] ‘your carved.work’; efe
tamã [3SG write_II.VN] ‘his written work’; na soxo kumã [1SG ground
put_II.VN] ‘my planted.work’. Later on, Drabbe gives a number of verbal
nouns “that can be rendered in Dutch by a past participle” (Drabbe
1957:16), and which designate ‘affected subjects’. Thus, we have axu
akümã [human die_II.VN] ‘dead person’; genimiã [clip_II.VN] ‘stump (e.g. of
arm)’; ān-afi [woman-take_II.VN] ‘married man’ and xu-afi [man-take_II.VN]
‘married woman’.","[72, 73]"

Coming back to the tendency in Papuan languages to avoid a stacking of

278                            PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure
developed an effective way of referent tracking: In addition to the inflection
of person and number on the verb, the language has developed a switch
reference system, with nonfinites indicating same subject (SS), and
semifinites implying different subject (DS). More on this can be found in
chapter 5, especially 5.4.","[295, 296]"

3.2.3.3 Recapitulation: pronouns, animacy and possession
Drabbe 1957: section 13, p. 7a-bAs was noted briefly in 3.2.1, the pronouns efe 3SG and joxo 3PL can only
be used as free pronouns when referring to human beings or to animals. As
part of a possessive construction of the form described in 3.1.2, however,
efe can also be used in combination with other nouns. Drabbe gives the
following examples:(240)     kito      efe      womu
          foot      3SG      middle
          ‘the middle toe / thirteen’ (Drabbe 1957: 7b)

190                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classesInstead of efe, one may also use one of the pronouns wofe(ne) or xofe(ne),
which are formed from wo ‘THAT’ and xo ‘DIST’ plus fe, but which I have
glossed simply as 3SG forms. The only example of these forms given by
Drabbe is the following, where we find the vowel e assimilated to the i of
the following noun. Assimilation to a following i is also not uncommon for
efe, as can be seen in example b.(242a)   xofini    fi                   b)   ifi    fi

expressions of space, I will make use of the term deictic center (DC) to
refer to the ‘point in space’ from where a situation is viewed. This section
will first focus on the form of demonstrative pronouns, and then go deeper
into their meaning and distribution.

Drabbe 1957: section 61, p. 24a,bAghu has three basic demonstrative pronouns. These can be used both
pronominally and adnominally, which is the reason that I will also refer to
them briefly as ‘demonstratives’. The form nego ‘THIS’ is used for reference
to entities close by, wo ‘THAT’ or wüo ‘THAT’ for entities somewhat further
away, at short distance, and xo ‘DST’ for entities far away. The basic
demonstrative pronoun xo ‘DST’ is also used as basis for complex forms (in
Drabbe’s analysis: compounds), in which the second member indicates a
position relative to the deictic center, like ‘upwards’, ‘downhill’,
‘upstream’. Like the demonstrative pronoun xo ‘DST’ that they are based
on, these complex forms can only be used to refer to entities at a distance
from the deictic center, and not to entities located in the deictic center:“The compounds can, therefore, never mean „this”, but only „that”, e.g. „that one up there, that one
down there, etc.”142
An overview of the complex demonstratives is given in the table below.
Note that the element go, which indicates short distance, is probably related
to nego ‘THIS’.","[207, 208, 209]"

When nouns are used as subject of a verb, we find an interesting
discrepancy between more animate and less animate nouns. For more
animate nouns, referring to bigger animals and human beings, subject
inflection on the verb is either singular or plural. This means that for these

more animate nouns the interpretation of the NP as referring to a singular
entity or more entities is guided by the inflection on the verb (optionally
supported by the use of joxo ‘3PL’ directly following the noun, see 3.1.5.5).
Compare the following two examples, where the verb of the first example
exhibits singular inflection, and the verb of the second example plural
inflection.","[180, 181]"

5.2 Basic observations       (1) Nonfinite verbs are virtually always followed by a clause with same
           subject; 221 they never form the final verb of a clause chain or
           sentence. The use of nonfinite verbs was briefly explained in
           2.3.2.1, and will be discussed in more detail in 5.4.1.1.
       (2) Within a clause chain, an asyndetic sequence of bare semifinite
           verbs with same subject is very rare. Stated differently, an asyndetic
           sequence of bare semifinite verbs has the strong implication that the
           following clause has a different subject. If we combine observation
           (1) and (2), we may state that clause chains are the domain of a
           rudimentary switch reference system (further explained in 5.4
           below).
       (3) Within a clause chain, -ne and -ku are used as markers of
           sequentiality and switch reference. They combine with semifinites or
           imperatives.
                a. According to Drabbe, the use of -ku implies that the
                    following clause has the same subject. The use of -ku seems
                    very rare or restricted to specific genres, as the text corpus
                    contains no examples of the use of -ku. The use of -ku is
                    further explained in 5.4.2.1.
                b. According to Drabbe, the use of -ne implies that the
                    following clause has a different subject. This is confirmed in
                    our corpus, as will be shown in 5.4.2.2.","[326, 327]"

Papuan languages to have personal or possessive pronouns that are tightly interwoven with
kinship terms was already noted by Drabbe (1950:101), and gives an anthropological
explanation: “in Awyu-Dumut languages, kinship terms express a dyadic relationship.
They do not refer to one person, as such, but to the relationship in which that person stands
to the speaker or another person (Stasch 2009:72). Awyu-Dumut kinship terms are not
inherently possessed, but it is rare for a kinship term to occur without the ‘possessor’ of
that particular kin being named” (Wester 2014: 56-57).
120
      From Drabbe’s description it is not clear whether contracted forms exist for all kinship
nouns, or only for a subset.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes                               159
Examples of this dyadic construction are given in (186) through (188)
below:(186)       efe       n-eto             efe         n-amoko
            3SG       LNK-father        3SG         LNK-son
            ‘father and son’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)

            3SG       LNK-husband             3SG        LNK-wife
            ‘husband and wife’ (Drabbe 1957:8a; 4.003)

            ‘younger and elder brother’ (Drabbe 1957:8a; 3.001)
It is important to note that the dyadic construction can be used for dyadic
relations only, not for reference to pairs in a non-dyadic relation. In that
respect, it can be contrasted to the use of ko, as in (189) below, where the
phrase can refer either to a married couple (dyadic) or to a non-married
‘man and woman’:(189)       ãŋ           go        ku
            woman        and       man
            ‘man and woman’ (Drabbe 1957:8a)3.1.5 Number
Drabbe 1957: section 9, p. 5a-b; section 14, p. 7b-8aThe famous linguistic scholar Roman Jakobson once stated that ‘languages
differ essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may
convey’ (Jakobson 1959). Every linguistic system, in other words, has
grammaticalized other aspects of reality, and every linguistic system should,
therefore, be described in its own terms. In this section, I would like to
160                        PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
make clear that Aghu differs with respect to a language like English in what
it must say about number. This is also true for definiteness, which will be
the topic of 3.1.6 below. speakers of English must specify each Noun
Phrase for number and definiteness: Noun Phrases are either singular or
plural, and either definite or indefinite. This is not true for speakers of
Aghu. Noun Phrases are generally not specified for number, and there is no
requirement in Aghu grammar to specify Noun Phrases for definiteness. In
the words of Drabbe:“axu k’etede [human ACC see-1.RLS[SG] may mean: ‘I saw the man, a man, the men,
men.””121
Thus, while Aghu differs from English in what it must convey, speakers of
Aghu may choose to specify nouns for the categories expressed by number
and definiteness: they may choose to express whether a Noun Phrase refers
to single or multiple entities, and may choose to specify whether Noun
Phrases refer to entities known to the addressee or not. In the remainder of
this section we will consider number, while we will have a look at the
category of definiteness in section 3.1.6 below.","[176, 177, 178]"
"
Following Wester (2014:173) we may define the subject in Aghu as “that
element of reality that is referred to by the person-number marking on the
semifinite or finite verb.” In intransitive clauses, person-number marking
refers to the sole, intransitive, subject-argument (S), as is true for the
inflection on fomeŋgenã in (439). In transitive clauses, person-number
marking refers to the transitive subject or “the most Agent-like argument
(A)” (cf. Payne 1997:133), as is the case for the inflection on bēkenã in
(440).",[290]
"
Nevertheless, the case markers are somewhat atypical. First, they are
optional, so that the following sentence, minimally differing from (523)a
and b, is also grammatical.  c      na        n-amse               ed-oxe-nã
         1SG.POS   LNK-child            give-N1.RLS-N1PL
         ‘my children gave it / they gave it to my children’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
Their optional nature raises the question about the precise motivation for
their use. One might hypothesize that they are used only when an NP’s
function is not clear from the context. This cannot explain, however, why it
is also possible to use these markers in case the verb has only one
argument, whose role can only be that of a subject, as in the following
example:
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 4: Clause structure                                           301(524)      na         n-amse          te       da-xe-nã
           1SG.POS    LNK-child       NOM      come-N1.RLS-N1PL
           ‘my children have come’ (Drabbe 1957:43b)
This example shows that the use of te cannot fully be explained from its
function as disambiguator between the syntactic roles of subject and object;
it must also have a pragmatic function. As our data are too limited — we
especially lack minimally contrastive examples and descriptions of their
meaning differences — we have to remain ignorant about the nature of this
pragmatic function. In verbal clauses, therefore, we analyze te and ke as
case markers, the use of which is also guided by pragmatic factors that
remain to be investigated.216
In nonverbal clauses, the use of te and ke again is optional, except in
clauses with meoxo ‘who’ as a subject, where it is obligatory.217 As was
shown in 4.2, both te and ke may be used either in subject position or as
marker of the copula complement. Te is consistently analyzed as a
nominative marker. Ke, however, is analyzed as a a focus marker. This
shown in the following table:Table 54: Analysis of ke and te in nonverbal clauses
                           te, analyzed as                   ke analyzed as
In subject position        Nominative case marker            Focus marker
As a complement            Nominative case marker            Focus marker
Considering ke in subject position, my main argument to analyze it as a
focus marker is of a negative nature, in that it is hard to think of ke as an
accusative marker:

      Dixon stresses that case may be expressed in different ways: either as affixes (ideally
and typically called case inflection, or as clitics (ideally called case clitics, typically called
case or apposition), or — as is the case in Aghu — as grammatical words, in which case
they are ideally called case words, and typically called adpositions. This book uses the
term postpositional case marker, to express both its realization as a grammatical word that
directly follows the NP and to express its function as a case marker.

Before coming to a one by one discussion, it is helpful to first give some
general properties of the postpositional case markers listed above, to
delineate them from members of other word classes. The defining
properties of the markers above are the following:
       -   They appear in final position of the phrase.
       -   They mark the syntactic or semantic relation between the noun
           phrase and the verbal predicate.
       -   Their use is generally optional, at least in certain contexts.179178
      In his discussion of “schakelelementen” Drabbe also mentions maga, used only in
combination with to ‘opening’ (Drabbe 1957:43a). To maga, then, is translated by Drabbe
as ‘in the opening’ or ‘at the door’. This maga is probably better analyzed as spatial noun
(3.5.2), rather than as a postpositional case marker.
179
      Here we are limited because of a lack of data, and suffer especially from the lack of
data obtained from independent fieldwork. One of the most straightforward ways to find
out whether a morpheme is optional, is to present an informant with both options, and ask
for the acceptability and meaning of both cases. Given that we lack this type of data, we
may conclude that the use of a morpheme is optional only in those cases where Drabbe´s
corpus happens to provide contrasting examples. And even then we do not know whether
there might be a subtle meaning difference going along with the use or non-use of the
morpheme in question.

The case markers te and ke were dealt with in 3.1.7, where it was shown
that they answer all three criteria mentioned here: they are used
postnominally, they mark the (semantic or) syntactic relation between the
predicate and the noun, and their use is optional. We now turn to a
discussion of the other postpositional case markers.","[258, 259, 260]"

The locative marker de seems, therefore, mutually exclusive with focus on
the location. The same principle might explain why the locative marker is

also lacking when posture verbs are combined with demonstratives, which
is the topic of this section. 100,101
Drabbe writes that the notion of ‘being present’ can be expressed by
combining a demonstrative element (nego ‘THIS’, xo ‘DST’ or ü ‘there’)
with the durative form of posture verbs. The demonstrative element directly
precedes the verb, and for a number of demonstrative-verb combinations
the language has developed contracted forms. Table 35 shows the forms for
combinations of posture verbs with nego ‘THIS’, where it should be noted
that nigi is used instead of nego.102
100
      This explanation is based on the assumption that there is a positive correlation between
demonstrative deixis and focus: demonstratives will usually be focused and therefore not
be followed by de. By frequency of association, what starts off as a tendency:
demonstratives are usually not followed by de, may grow into a grammatical restriction:
demonstratives cannot be followed by de, but directly precede the verb. That
demonstratives frequently precede the verb is proven by the existence of the contracted
forms under discussion here.
101
      It should be noted that locative verbs may easily bring along a focus on the clause as a
whole, which Lambrecht describes as ‘presentational’ or ‘thetic’ focus (1994: 141,
168,233). An example of a thetic focus in this context would be a sentence like ‘there’s
mother sitting there’, where the whole sentence is an assertion, or ‘new information’. In
order to decide whether the verbs under discussion here bring along this reading, however,
we would need examples of the use of these sentences in daily conversation.
102
      Although Drabbe might be right in his suggestion that nigi is a contracted form of nego
and the durative prefix -i, it is remarkable that except from here, durative i- and
durative -ke are never used simultaneously.

The following table gives combinations of posture verbs with a
demonstrative element ü ‘there’ which is only used in this position, while
Table 37 gives combinations of verbs with xo ‘over there’. Drabbe notes
that forms of 1st person with ü ‘there’ or xo ‘over there’ ‘are not attested of
course’ [boldface mine, WvdH]. Apparently, the durative verbs under
discussion only allow for a present reading, or at least enforce that the
deictic center coincides with the present location of the speaker. If the
deictic center necessarily coincides with the position of the speaker, it is
inherently contradictory to state that ‘I am / (or: was?) (over) there’.103Table 36: Demonstrative ü ‘there’ combined with durative form of posture verb

In addition to the forms discussed so far, one also finds combinations of

Dead humans or dead animals                 i(g) ‘lie’
The verb ba(x) ‘sit’ can only refer to living humans or birds. Of the
animals, only birds are conceptualized of as usually sitting (when not
flying), while the other animals are thought of as lying or standing,
dependent on whether they are considered as creeping animals or not. An
analogous division between lying and standing applies to objects, and more
research would be needed to find out more about the criteria that make
objects belong to either of these two classes. Fruits on a tree are
conceptualized of as lying, which is also true for dead animals or dead
humans. 92
92
     Whereas animateness also plays a role in the use of continuative_I stems derived from
posture verbs, discussed in 2.4.3.4 above, this role is remarkably different. In these derived
stems, inanimates can only combine with ba-me, and not with me-me and i-me. The use of
these latter two derived verbs is, in other words, restricted to animates.

Although nouns referring to ‘masses’ are not discussed explicitly by
Drabbe, one might conclude from examples like (151) and (152) that these
are considered as lying (and possibly should, according to Drabbe, be
classified as ‘things that are usually in a more or less lying position’).(148)      napi       de      ba-xe

           ‘there will be a lot of meat’ (Drabbe 1957:32b)
We now come back to the function of de and the relation to other
expressions of location. I follow Drabbe in analyzing de as referring to
location, because de can only be left out, optionally, in case there is (also)
another reference to location preceding the verb.93 Consider (153) and (154)
below, where one could say that de is optional because of the presence of93
     See 3.11 for the relation between the locative marker de and the copula de.
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                     133
the spatial expression baxu womu ‘the inside of the house’ and soxo
‘ground’, respectively.(153)      büsiu      womu      (de)    ba-xe

(154)     soxo        (de)              i-ge
          ground      LOC               lie-N1.RLS[SG]
          ‘it lies on the ground’ (Drabbe 1957:33b)
It is interesting to note that although de can usually be combined with
expressions of location, it cannot follow the case marker kèmu or ke, as
illustrated in (155) and (156) below. The reason for this is not clear. 94
Drabbe remarks that (in the sentences under discussion here) kèmu or
kem= is used after nouns, as in (155), while ke or k’ is used after
pronouns, as in (156).95(155)      büsiu      womu      kem=      (*de)       ba-xe
           house      inside    ACC       LOC         sit-N1.RLS[SG]
           ‘he is inside the house’ (Drabbe 1957:33b)
(156)      büsiu      womu      xo=        k’         (*de)              ba-xe
           house      inside    DST        ACC        LOC                sit-N1.RLS[SG]
           ‘he is inside the house over there’ (Drabbe 1957:33b)
94
     There might, however, be a relation to focus. One might hypothesize that de expresses
focus on the predicate as a whole (cf. note 101) while ke ‘ACC’ may be thought of as
implying focus on the location; see the discussion on the markers te and ke in 3.1.7 and
4.4. Compare also section 2.8.3.1, where we see that de is also mutually exclusive with the
use of demonstratives, which can be considered as focal by definition.
95
     It is not entirely clear how this tendency (or — if this distribution is absolute —
complementary distribution) relates to the distribution between ke, kèmu and kumu
discussed in 3.6.2.

Drabbe points out that posture verbs are also used to express the concept of
‘possession’. In order to state that a ‘pronominal possessor’ possesses a
‘possessed’, a speaker of Aghu will use a possessive noun phrase as
discussed in 3.1.2, followed by a posture verb, as illustrated in (157)
through (159) below.(157)       na          namse             de         ba-xe-nã

Posture verbs can have both stative and inchoative readings, 96 and can be
contrasted with a number of verbs that are intrinsically inchoative: xuba(x)
‘sit down’, doto(x) ‘get up from lying position’97, (saŋge-de=k) musu-
du=k e(k) [(raise-SS=CON) come.up-SS=CON stand] ‘get up from sitting
into standing position’ and düko(x) ‘lie down’. To this may also be added
the form mese(k) ‘get up from sitting position’, a form that is cited in
section 2.2 and 2.5.","[149, 150, 151, 152]"

      Languages differ in the extent to which the semifinite forms have developed into verbs
that can be used in DS — and, therefore, medial — conditions only. Mandobo is a language
where this is not the case: here ‘the presence of an independent semifinite verb form in
medial position signals switch-reference, with no formal differentiation between DS forms
and independent or final verbs’ (de Vries 2010: 345). North Wambon, on the other hand, is
a language that did develop dedicated DS forms, which can only be used in medial position
and signal DS.

5.4.1 Switch reference as attested in the text corpus
5.4.1.1 Nonfinite same-subject forms
Drabbe (1957): section 49, p. 19A brief look at one of the Aghu texts will convince the reader that nonfinite
SS forms are very common. As was stated in 2.3.2.1:
       1. Nonfinite verb forms never form the final verb of a clause chain;
       2.   The subject of the nonfinite verb is the same as the subject of the
            following verb. 225
Sequences of clauses with the same subject are typically expressed by a
sequence of nonfinite SS forms, with the final verb of the sentence formed
by a semifinite (or more rarely: finite) verb. Consider the following
sentence, where all nonfinite SS forms have been written in bold:(535)        Wo             xonok                 abu                dadek             büsiü

             house and eat (them), and the following day his mothers in turn stay, they stay
             at home.’ (1.092)
After a series of nonfinite forms, sharing the same subject, we find the
semifinite form eŋgena ‘they eat’. This semifinite form here closes off the
first clause chain. It is followed by a second clause within the same
sentence, in which we find a semifinite verb with a different subject: efe
napigi ‘his mothers’. This clause, finally, is followed by the final clause of
the sentence, which functions to specify the penultimate clause.226
Drabbe points out that SS forms can also be used when the (referent of the)
subject of the first clause is part of the (referents of the) subject of the
following clause. Drabbe gives the following example:(536)       Dü       afi      efe         küda              ede-de=k      ẽ-ge-nã.

Comparable examples from the text corpus are given in (537) and (538)-
(539).227 In (537) we see that the subject of ededek, the older sister, also226
      This type of clause sequences will be the topic of section 5.4.3.

      The text corpus also contains an example, however, where we find an explicit DS-form
in such a situation, illustrated below:

(265)a-c below. Note that, parallel to what we saw for full NP’s in 3.1.7, te
is used to mark either an intransitive subject (as in (264)) or a transitive
subject (as in (265)a and b), while ke is used to mark an object. As is clear
from (265)a-c, the function of the case marker is to disambiguate between
different syntactic roles. The fact, however, that it is also possible to use a
case marker in (264) — where the syntactic role of meoxo is not ambiguous
— shows that it must also have a pragmatic function.154(264)       meoxo    (te)       da-xe

      Cf. the discussion of te in 3.1.7, especially example (222).

          ‘*Who has stabbed someone?’ / Whom has he stabbed)?’ (Drabbe 1957:27a)
As can be seen in (266)a - c below, in nominal predicates, interrogative
pronouns obligatorily combine with te or ke. In this respect, they differ
from nouns, where the use of te or ke is optional. The difference between
the use of te and ke is not clear, but their function is clearly not to
differentiate between different syntactic roles. It is more likely that their use
has to do with the type of focus, but we have insufficient data to say
anything more about the respective roles of ke and te with any certainty.155(266)a     *meoxo     de
           who        COP

155
      Interrogative pronouns are focused in the sense that they represent the ‘component of
(...) the proposition whereby the assertion [WvdH: in this case expressed by the question
word] differs from the presupposition [WvdH: the fact that there is someone]’ (cf.
Lambrecht 1994:213). This may explain the use of ke. Whereas te is not a focus marker, it
is not incompatible with focus, and it is not unthinkable that te would represent a different
tye of focus than ke, like presentational or thetic focus, with the focus on the predicate as a
whole. With the little data that we have, however, we can only speculate about this
difference.

Drabbe also gives a number of examples where the interrogative pronoun
meoxo is used to refer to the possessor in a possessive construction. First
consider (267) and (268), where the latter gives two possible answers to the
former.(267)       gu          meoxo        n-axu           de156

            ‘I am someone from the Xoxonasàfo clan (Drabbe 1957:27a)
Two other question-answer pairs are the following:(269)       gu     meoxo      xu       de /      gu          meoxo       siü     de

Examples (271) through (273) form two final examples of interrogatives
referring to possessors. Note that (273) is an example of a possessive
construction embedded in another expression.","[217, 218, 219]"

The story for all pronouns except 3SG, as presented by Drabbe, is rather
straightforward. Like nouns, discussed in 3.1.7, in verbal subject position
they may be accompanied by an optional nominative marker te, while as a
direct or indirect object they may combine with an accusative marker ke. In
nonverbal clauses, discussed in 4.2.1 and 4.4, they may combine with the
nominative case marker te or with the focus marker ke. As stated above,
182                             PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
however, Drabbe’s claims about free personal pronouns in other than 3rd
person can hardly be checked, due to lack of data. We now turn to the use
and distribution of the 3SG pronouns efe and eke, which deserve a more
elaborate discussion.
3.2.3.2 3rd person pronouns efe and eke
Drabbe 1957: section 12, p. 6b-7aThis section take the use of 3rd person pronouns as attested in the text
corpus as a starting point, and then returns to what Drabbe writes about
them. Although I will not go deeply into the definition of focus, I believe
that the overview of contexts in which eke and efe are used justifies my
analysis of eke as a contracted form of efe plus ke and as a focused form of
efe.","[199, 200]"

           ‘The eldest sister comes down and goes.’ (1.051)
If we exclude the use of efe in possessive constructions, we are left with
only four attestations of efe in the entire corpus. In only one case, the
pronoun efe is followed by te, which is the nominative marker that is also
optionally used after other pronouns or nouns in subject position (see
above). The sentence is part of narrative 2; father and mother have just put
their penis gourd and their skirt in a water quiver. They tell the children to
watch these objects; if they start to perish, then they know that Apupüsimo
has killed them:(230)       Boasĩ,                  Apupüsimo     efe     te       nügu      xomüge.

            ‘(If) they wear down, then (you know that) Apupüsimo he has killed us.’ (2.074)
The sentence above is the only example in the entire corpus where we find
efe combined with te. In all other cases, three in total, we find efe preceded
by a NP and followed by ke ta FOC IN.TURN. The context of use of efe ke ta
is identical to that of the far more frequent eke ta, which will be discussed
below.140
Turning to the use of eke, its distribution as attested in the text corpus can
be summarized as follows:
140
      We will come back to the use of NP efe ke ta in note 141 below.
184                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
    (1) It is attested in subject function only, despite of the fact that Drabbe
         describes eke as a 3SG “oblique” form (which roughly corresponds
         to what I call an accusative marker; see Drabbe’s note to 6.155).
      (2) In 20 out of a total of 24 attestations, eke is preceded by a subject
         NP (once consisting of a free pronoun only) and followed by ta
         ‘IN.TURN’.
      (3) In the other 3 cases, eke is neither preceded by a subject NP nor
         followed by ta
We will first consider those cases where eke is combined with a subject NP
and ta. The contexts where this construction is used can be clearly defined.
The construction is attested in three different texts, all of which narrate
about persons in a dyadic relationship: a younger and an elder brother in
texts 3 and 6, and a younger and an elder sister in text 1. In all contexts of
use, we first find narrated how one of the two persons participates as
‘subject’ (corresponding to syntactic S or A) in a certain event. Then we
find the sentence where eke ta is used, which always expresses that the
other person of the dyadic relation has, in turn, participated as subject
(again, corresponding to S or A) in a similar event. Consider (231) through
(233) below. In the preceding sentences, it has been narrated how the
younger and the elder brother both leave the house to go hunting and
fishing, respectively. The younger brother shoots a cassowary, and brings it
home. The following sentences narrate how the younger brother comes
first, or ‘participates as subject in the event of coming’ and waits for his
brother. Sentence (233) then tells how the elder brother comes up too, or
‘participates as a subject in a similar event of coming’.","[200, 201, 202]"

          (2.133)
122
      The choice for singular inflection in (195) and (196) above could be explained on the
assumption that the sago crumbs and the fruits are conceived of not as multiple individual
objects, but as a collective whole. This might be taken as an argument in favor of an
analysis in which it is ‘individuation’ rather than animacy that underlies the hierarchy; for
a discussion of individuation, and a hierarchy based on this concept cf. Audring 2009:123f.

3.1.5.3 Nouns in non-subject functionWe now come to cases where nouns or NP’s are used in other than subject
position. Here, singular number may be specified by the use of fe ‘3SG’,
while plurality may be expressed by the use of a 3PL pronoun following the
noun. Of the latter the text corpus contains only one example, however.123
In my view, fe functions as a marker of singular number, which expresses
that reference is made to one token out of a set of tokens of the same type.
This makes my analysis somewhat different from Drabbe, who states that fe
“actually means ‘other’”:“Where we use an indefinite pronoun, we sometimes find fe, used both in combination
with things and with persons. The actual meaning is ‘other’; büsiü fe may mean ‘the other
house’, ‘another house’ but also ‘a house’.”124
123
      Other than in this book, Drabbe does not make a systematic distinction between nouns
used as subject and nouns in other functions. On the basis of Drabbe’s discussion, one
might conclude that nouns can be specified for plural number by the use of joxo ‘3PL’
irrespective of their syntactic or semantic function. NP’s in fe, however, are attested in
non-subject position only. In the data available to us, we have only one example of a non-
subject modified by joxo:
(...)      efe      napigi           joxo     edoxene          eŋgenã.
           efe      n-api-gi         joxo     ed-oxe -ne       ẽ -ge-nã
           3SG      LNK-mother-PL    3PL      give-N1.RLS -DS eat-N1.RLS -N1PL
           ‘He gives his mothers and the two of them eat.’ (1.095)
More on joxo, especially its use in subject NP’s can be found in 3.1.5.5 below.
124
      “Waar wij een onbep. lidw. gebruiken vinden we bij zaken zowel als bij personen wel
eens fe, dat eigenlijk „andere” betekent; büsjü fe kan betekenen „het andere huis”, „een
ander huis”, maar ook „’n huis.” ” (Drabbe 1957:5b)
166                          PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 3: Other word classes
The different ‘meanings’ described by Drabbe are, in my view, all
contextual implications of the use of fe ‘3SG’ and have to do more with the
translation into Dutch than with actual meaning differences. The formative
is often used in series of references to several tokens of the same type. In
these contexts it often refers to ‘another one’ of the same token, or — when
the series is restricted to two tokens — ‘the other one’, cf. the examples
from (198) onwards.","[182, 183, 184]"
"2.4.2 Habitual aspect
Drabbe section 56, p. 22-23Habitual aspect is expressed by the iterative stem plus another iterative
suffix -sumu. As some of the iterative stems are formed by means of the
88                                         PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs
same suffix, this may result in forms with a double suffix -sumu, as in the
following example, which contrasts the iterative with the habitual form of
the verb.(81)a    eto-sum-oxe.                        b       eto-sum-sum-oxe.

         ‘he looked repeatedly’                      ‘he was used to look’ (Drabbe 1957:22b-23a)
Drabbe gives the following two additional examples to illustrate the
contrast.(82a)    fi-ogom-oxe                             b    fi-ogom-sum-oxe

        ‘He went time and time again’                   ‘He was used to go’ (Drabbe 1957:23a)
In the text corpus we find only one example of a habitual formation. This
example was given in 2.3.1.2 above and is repeated here:(84)    Enigomodok                etedek                     basumsumoxe.

        ‘It always sits, eating and watching.’ (9.08)2.4.3 Durative (progressive) aspect
In this book I follow Drabbe in his use of the term ‘durative’, except that I
use the term ‘continuative’ for the forms discussed in 2.4.3.4, which
express different degrees of longer duration. Apparently, for Drabbe the
term ‘durative’ (Dutch: duratief) doesn’t need any further explanation; for
PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs                                                    89
him it suffices to use the term and to translate durative verbs or
constructions with a Dutch present continuous.64
In order to describe the meaning of the durative forms and constructions in
Aghu, we follow Drabbe’s characterization plus translation of individual
examples, and study the use of duratives in texts (of which Drabbe gives
only translations for entire passages, and morpheme-to-morpheme glosses).
Doing so, we may describe the meaning and use of the durative as
follows:65
       -   The durative presents an event as an ‘ongoing activity’, and, by
           implication, as an activity with a certain duration.
       -   In all of the attested cases, durative forms are followed directly by a
           comma, semicolon or a full stop; they are, in other words, clause or
           sentence-final (cf. section 5.1 on the notions of clause and sentence).
       -   There is no implication of temporal overlap with the event
           expressed by a following predicate. It is the context which guides
           the interpretation at this point.","[105, 106, 107]"
"
       1. Nonfinite verb forms never form the final verb of a clause chain or
           sentence (for the definition of clause chain and sentence see section
           5.1).
       2. The subject of the nonfinite verb is coreferential with the subject of
           the following verb.46
45
     “het zijn geen deelwoorden in de volle zin van die term, doch ze kunnen in het Ned.
door deelwoorden worden weergegeven, en we hebben nu eenmaal een term nodig”
(Drabbe 1957:18a).
46
     Although this is true in the great majority of cases, the text corpus contains a few
examples of nonfinite forms followed by a verb with different subject. I noted the
following cases: 1.304, 3.085, 3.157, 6.109, 6.161, 6.284, and 6.302.Some of these cases
could possibly be explained by assuming that we have to do with a verb of perception that
has been left out, for example in 3.085, where I have added the verb in brackets (cf. 3.072,
3.076 and 3.096, where the verb dake is used):
          Abu       dadek              [dake]
          a-bu      da-de=k            da-ke

50                                             PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: VerbsIn Aghu no difference can be discovered between the functions of -bu
and -dV.47 In this respect, the language seems to have neutralized a prior
distinction that is still found in other Awyu languages, where cognates of -
bu are used for future nonfinites, and cognates of -dV for present and
preterite reference as well as for imperatives (Drabbe 1957:18b, referring to
Drabbe 1950). The forms in Aghu can be followed by both realis and
irrealis verb forms, and get a temporal and modal interpretation according
to the specifications of these following verbs (and the context in which
these verbs are used). Drabbe (1957:18) gives the following examples to
illustrate his point. Note that in all cases the subject of a-de and a-bu is
identical to the subject of the following verb xo-xe ‘he went’.(14)a      a-d’               xo-xe

While 3.157 can also be explained along the same lines (and possibly 6.109 ‘he sees his
brother cutting the meat’, but I admit this ‘explanation’ is very much ad hoc), this is not
possible for the other cases, although it is remarkable that also in 6.284 and 6.302 we have
to do with a context of perception.

     Drabbe remarks that with imperatives, however, there seems to be a preference for the
use of -dV over bu, as in da-de=k bunu [come-SS=CON sit.IMP[SG] ] ‘come and sit here’
or a-de noxi [take-SS go.IMP[SG] ] ‘take it with you’.

           Drabbe 1957:18b)
The following two examples have been taken from two different texts, and
show the use of nonfinites formed both with -dV and with -bu in narratives.
In the texts available to us, the forms formed with -dV clearly outnumber
those formed with -bu. For bagidi, which is a bleached form, see section
2.8.3.3.(16)       (...) ba-gidi     xati       mi-di             xo-xe-nã.
           sit-next.day      again      come.down-SS      go-N1.RLS-N1PL
           ‘(...), the next day they come down and go again.’ (2.016)
(17)       Büsiü      a-bu           da-xe-nã.
           house      takeI-SS       come-N1.RLS-N1PL
           ‘They bring it home.’ (lit. ‘taking (it) they come home.’; 1.238)
Of the forms in -dV, the great majority are followed by a clitic =k, which,
however, is — for technical reasons — written as an affix in the text corpus
(see e.g. 1.005). According to Drabbe, this suffix is a ‘connective’ (Dutch:
schakelement) ke, which is usually shortened to =k. The latter form is
indeed much more frequent: in the text corpus we find only one example of
nonfinite forms plus=ke (in 4.80), compared to hundreds of attestations of
=k. According to Drabbe, nonfinites plus =k form less of a unit with the
event expressed by the following verb, or — even more specific — express
that the two events generally take place in sequence. Thus, according to
Drabbe (1957:19), the following two sentences differ slightly in meaning.
In (18a) below, what happens is portrayed as an event of taking (an object)
52                                       PART I: GRAMMAR. Chapter 2: Verbs
followed by an event of going (with the object still being carried), while the
b) sentence expresses an event of going with a simultaneous event of
carrying the object.(18a)    a-de=k             xo-xe
         take-SS=CON        go-N1.RLS[SG]
         ‘he took it and went away’ (Drabbe 1957: 19a)
( b)     a-d’               xo-xe
         take-SS            go-N1.RLS[SG]
         ‘he had it (e.g. in his hand) and went away’ (Drabbe1957:19a)
Drabbe is ready to admit, however, that the relation between the use of =k
and sequentiality is not more than a tendency. More importantly, the text
corpus contains clear examples of the use of =k in cases where reference is
made to events that should clearly not be interpreted as taking place in
sequence. One such example is the use of =k in durative constructions, as
illustrated in (19) below (for more information on durative aspect the reader
is referred to 2.4.3).","[67, 68, 69, 70]"
