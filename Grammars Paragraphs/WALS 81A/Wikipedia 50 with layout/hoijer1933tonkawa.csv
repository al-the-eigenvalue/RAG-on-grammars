                             23. Word Order.
   The normal word order of the Tonkawa sentence is subject,
object and verb. It is, however, not a necessary order since syntactic
relations are sufficiently indicated by suffixes. Word order is only
important in distinguishing the functions of certain modifiers.
That is, the distinction between adjective and adverb depends upon
the position of the form in question. If the modifier stands between
           HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN                     LANGUAGES     27a noun and its formal suffix, it has adjectival function ; if it stands
directly before a verb, it has adverbial function. Examples:
        gwa'n-enox-la                  a pretty woman
        henox yagnano'                 he shoots well
        ha',ago'n-gwa'lo'dak-la        a very big man
        gwa'lo'dak bandjalo'           he opens his mouth very widely
                                 24. Reduplication.
  The grammatical processes described in the preceding sections
have all related to alternations of theme with affix or theme with
theme. Reduplication is the only grammatical process which varies
the internal form of the theme itself. The whole theme is rarely
repeated: generally only one element (i. e. phonologic element) is
repeated (cf. 37). The function of reduplication is to indicate
repeated action. Examples:
        dobo-                          to cut
        dodobo-                        to cut repeatedly
        y'odjo-                        to pinch
        y'oy'o'djo                     to pinch repeatedly
        x'ele-                        to sharpen (e. g. a knife)
        x'ex'ele-                     to sharpen repeatedly
                            A. T H E V E R B ( 2 5   82)                            25. General Remarks.
   The elements making up a verb complex may be divided into
three classes according to their position in the word: theme affixes,
theme, and theme suffixes. The first and last of these classes are the
same in function; that is, they provide for the grammatical and
syntactical relations of the verb and also serve to amplify the
meaning of the theme. The theme itself contains no formal elements;
its meaning is the concrete, the basic one of the verb form. An
example will make this clear.
        ge-nec-xa-ile-nec'-o-'        they two cause me to throw it to
                                          a distance
     Theme: -He-, the reduced form of yale- to throw, hit with a missile.
     Theme prefixes: ge- me; nec- causative; xa- with force, to a distance.
     Theme suffixes: -nec', dual subject; -o, declarative mode; -', third
         person, present tense.
28                         HOIJER TONKAWAThere are illustrated above three verb prefixes. A complete list in
the order of their appearance in the verb, is given below.
           ge- first person object pronoun
           we- third person plural object pronoun
           geu- first person plural object pronoun
           nec- causative
           da - to, with
           ya- causative
           xa-, x- to a distance, with force
These will be discussed in detail and examples of their use given in
sections 47—51.
  The theme suffixes are much more numerous and express all
ideas of tense, mode, person (except for the three object pronouns
prefixed), and number. I n general, they have the following order.","[36, 37, 38]"
"    (33) I t is not clear how 'edcin'e functions in this sentence: formally,
having no case suffixes, it should have adverbial function as, indeed,
it does have at the end of line 2, page 287, but there is no verb
following unless we connect it with the preceding particle 'e-da.
    (34) daxac sun, haglana-k, -k form of ha-gla-na- one person goes
down. Cf. note 29.
    (35) 'adj-xawa- ('adjxo--) wind blows from the north; cold,
disagreeable wind blows. The analysis of this form is not so clear:
the element 'adj- appears to occur in ben-'ats spring (the meaning of
ben- is unknown), and in 'adj-'ix cold, disagreeable ('ix bad).
Perhaps 'adj- has reference to weather in a sense of disagreeable
weather and - xawa- refers to the blowing of the wind. This analysis
is purely speculative.
   (36) Note the plural form of the noun gwa-n woman (cf. 84).
   (37) noho-na'e--to go for wood,— an unanalyzable theme. Perhaps
compounded of noho-na-, which may be an old theme meaning
""wood"" and -V-, a form of the verb 'ei-na- to go off.
   (38) we-l'ad he, that one (over there), cf. 91. 'ei-d- to come, plus
the modal suffix -e-l, cf. 63.
   (39) xogoc refers to that part of the body above the waist; -'a-w'an
singular definite dative (towards) suffix.
   (40) gec'adjan below the waist.
  (41) caxwa- to run away, — also means 'to be frightened'.

subject, subject modifier, object, subordinated verb, and principal

adjectivally (cf. 87).

There are minor exceptions to this order; these details and others
will be discussed in section 52.
   I t is apparent from this classification t h a t our study of the
Tonkawa verb will fall rather neatly into two parts: the theme, and
the theme affixes. The first is to deal with the few variations
undergone by verb themes and to establish, if possible, the rules
governing its structure and manipulation. In the second part — the
study of theme affixes — the grammatical and syntactical varia-
tions of the verb form will be discussed.
                   a . THE V E E B THEME ( 2 6   39)                      26. Types of Verb Theme.
    Tonkawa verb themes may be divided, roughly, into two classes
— two element themes (i. e., themes composed of two phonetic
elements, cf. 5), and three element themes. The latter class may be
sub-divided, however, according to the character of the first position
element. That is, certain elements (na-, ne-, ya-, ha-, and he-)
appear consistently as the first elements in so many of these themes
t h a t they may be considered as prefixes. The themal types are,
           HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES                     29then: two element themes, three element themes (placing here those
three element themes not containing any of the above ""prefixes""),
na- themes, ne- themes, ya- themes, ha- themes, and he- themes.
Finally, there are a number of two and three element themes which
always appear with certain theme prefixes (nec-, hec-, ya-, and
da--). In these cases, the theme prefixes have become so much a
part of the theme that it cannot be used without them. The whole
classification may, then, be summarized in the following manner.
  1. Prefix-less Themes;
       a. Two element themes.
       b. Three element themes.
  2. Themes whose first elements appear to be old prefixes.
      a. na- themes.
      b. ne- themes.
      c. ya- themes.
      d. ha- themes.
      e. he- themes.
  3. Themes requiring theme prefixes to complete their meanings.
       a. ya- themes.
       b. nec- themes, (hec- themes are a sub-division of this group)
       c. da•- themes.","[38, 39]"
"   The position of the second person object suffix varies in relation
to other theme suffixes. Normally, it follows the f u t u r e tense suffix
-a-do- a n d t h e order is a follows:
   Theme — F u t . — 2d. pers. — Contin. — Mode —                     But
when t h e negative suffix -abe- is added to t h e theme, the order
becomes:
   Theme — 2d pers. — Neg. — F u t . — Contin. — Mode —
                                 Examples:
          ya'lo'n -a'doncfc           I will kill him
          ya'lo'n -a'dewa'no'c        I will kill you
         ya'lo'n -ab -a'dono'c        I will not kill him
         ya'lo'na'b -a'dono'c         I will not kill you  The second person plural object is expressed by prefixing we- in
addition to the suffixed length.
         we-yalo-na'we'c              I kill ye
         we-i gabcrwe'c               I hit ye
         we-yadje'we'c                I see y e  The third person object is never expressed in the singular: in the
plural it is indicated b y t h e prefix we-.
         yagbo'c                      I hit him
         we-igabo'c                   I hit them

           42. Pronoun Object Forms used as the Subject.
   The pronoun object may also be interpreted as the subject of the
action and such an interpretation gives a slightly different conno-
tation to the verb. For example, t'ca-b-o'c I hide (intr.), becomes
ge-t'cab-o' I hide him, where ge- is the subject and the form really
means "" I act as a hiding place for him, I hide him by standing before
him"". Or, hedjn-o'c I lie down, as contrasted with g-e-djn-o' I fall
down, i. e., I lie down involuntarily, stumble and fall. I n general,
then, the interpretation of the object as subject gives a sort of
passive significance to the action: the subject being acted upon by
forces beyond its control. Further examples of these alternations
follow.
          hedlaw-o'c                     I refuse (active)
          ge'dlaw-o*                     I refuse (as when someone calls me
                                              and I indicate refusal by ignor-
                                              ing the call)
           'adj-o'c                       I sicken, become ill (active; rarely
                                              used)

          ya'lo'n-o'                     he kills him or he was killedI n the above series, there is a choice of translations and the exact
meaning of the form depends upon the context in which it is used.
camoxa'dak heyadje-noklakno,o it (an iron house) was looking very red (hot),
       it is said, camoxa'dak very red; he- reflexive pronoun, cf. 43; -yadje-

       came into view"".","[79, 80]"
"
                  38. Auxiliary Themes and Particles.
   There are three auxiliary themes in Tonkawa, -ye--, -em- to be;
-we- to be (as the result of having become), to become; -ei-, -V-
to be (in a certain place), to do. We have seen, in the discussion of
final theme elements, that there may have been others but these
three are the only ones now freely used — i. e., not permanently a
part of any particular theme or group of themes, (cf. 34).                           i. -ye'-,   -e- t o be,
   This theme has the form -ye-- when attached to themes which can
stand alone — i. e., which need no formal suffixes to complete their
meaning (themes functioning as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs)
and the form -e~- when used with verb themes. Thus:
         hocac-ye'-                 to be young (hocac young)
         xalal-ye'-                 to be hot, have a fever (xalal     hot)
         wixwan-ye'-                to be small (wixwan small)
         h a "" ' a g o ' n - y e t o be a man (hcr'ago'n man)         hedjn-e'-                      to be lying down (hedjne- to lie down)
         yel-e~-                        to be sitting (yela- to sit down)
         heilab-e'-                     to be standing (heilaba- to stand up)
         hendoc-e--                     several are standing (hendoc- several
                                             stand, stop moving)
Note that the combination of active verb and the auxiliary -e~-
gives a static significance to the expression.                        ii. -we- to be, become.
   This auxiliary is also used with themes functioning as adjectives
and adverbs but differs in meaning in that it defines a static con-
dition resulting from preceding activity. Thus, go-c'a-we- to be old,
have become old, is a possible form but hocac-we- is impossible since
one cannot become younger.
   -we- added to noun themes has the function of verbifying those
themes and the resulting verb may either be active or static. Thus:
         V'a                            night

   This auxiliary is used with all forms as is -ye-- but differs in that
the meaning of the resulting combination may be active as well as
static. Thus, m'e-ldjidjen sheet lightning, plus - V - becomes m'e-l-
djidjen-'e-- sheet lightning plays, flashes. The variation in form
between -'ei- and - V - is phonetic (cf. 8).
   The meaning ""to be"" of -'ei- emphasizes locality rather than
quality as in the case of -ye--. Contrast, for example, yel-e-- to be
sitting, where the emphasis is on the fact of a person sitting and
having been seated for a long time, with yel-'ei- to be sitting there,
the emphasis being on the position of the person concerned. This
difference is very neatly brought out in the following pair of text
forms: heilaban-t'cel-'a-y'ik (at the top of the tree), yel-e--laklakno'o
he was sitting, it is said, at the top of the tree, as contrasted with
da--yel-'e--noklakno'o he was sitting there with her, it is said. In the
last form no location is specified, the auxiliary placing the action.
   A peculiar usage of -'ei- is illustrated in the following two themes:
         yax- ei-                      to be hungry (yaxa- to eat)
         'a'x-'ei-                     to be thirsty ('a-x water)Here the auxiliary appears to imply desire, thus: 'a-x-'ei- to want
water, be thirsty, yax-'ei- to want to eat, be hungry. There are no
other examples of this usage.
  Tonkawa particles are all formed by the addition of various
conjunctive, subordinating and participial suffixes (cf. 64) to a
theme much resembling the auxiliary -'ei-.

         'e'-da                        and then

    We have now presented all the available evidence for the partition
 of the theme. The evidence, though scattered and largely incapable
 of generalization, is enough, it seems to me, to justify an hypothesis
 concerning the possible process involved in theme structure.
    First, it is quite apparent that there are a number of first position
 elements sufficiently represented to indicate that they are not
 fortuitous similarities but are the vestiges of a once more complete
 list of prefixes governing the relation between the other elements of
 the theme. It seems likely that there are three classes of elements —
 or groups of elements — used in constructing themes. These are,
in order of their occurrence, prefixes (such as ya-, Tie-, ha-, he-, and
possibly na-), stem elements, and suffixes (such as -'a, -'e, -we, -ne,
etc.). Not all themes, however, have now or ever had at an earlier
time all of these elements. I t is more likely that a typological
classification of themes can be made — somewhat as follows.
  A. Themes identical with stems. This section would include such
themes as mama- to carry, pack. . ., cLobo- to c u t . . . , 'ege- to give
to . . . , djexe- to loosen, untie . . . , and many others. There are
indications that even these simple forms can be broken up —
perhaps into two units, one defining the class of the object, and the
other the action itself. There is not, however, enough evidence of
such partition on which to construct a tenable hypothesis.
    B. Themes composed of stem and suffix. Included here would be
such themes as ha--na- one person goes away, da-na- two persons
go away, wa~-na- to fall forwards, ga~-na- to throw . . . away,
x'ax'ai-'a- to laugh (x'ax'ai- considered a reduplicated form of a
complex element x'ai-), m'e-l-ne- to be alight, burning, t'cei-'e- to
be jealous of . . . , and others.
    These would seem to be old nouns or verb participals compounded
with the elements we have described as verbalizers (cf. 34). In only
a few cases, as was seen in section 34, can these verbalizers be
definitely isolated: our hypothesis must rest on those cases and be
judged accordingly.
    C. Themes composed of prefix, stem, and suffix. This is, theoreti-
cally, a refinement on class B. There a direct relationship exists
between stem and suffix, the latter activizing the former. Here that
relationship is, theoretically again, modified by the initial element
of the theme. Thus, in such a theme as ya-din-'e- to scrape . . .
(a hide), -din- may be an old word for the act of scraping or doing
with a scraper, -e the verbalizer, and ya- an element establishing
an instrumental relationship between -din- and -e. Therefore, the
form would be translatable, literally, ""to do by means of scraping""
or ""to scrape . . . (a hide)"". Or, in the verb ya-xw -dje- to strike . . .
           HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN I N D I A N     LANGUAGES            67with a club, the -dje might be considered a verbalizer and -xw (the
reduced form of -xwe) may refer to action with a club or possibly
to the noun ""club"" itself. Therefore, ""to do by means of clubbing""
or ""to strike by means of a club"". This feeling for -dje as a verbalizer
is strengthened by the fact t h a t it is dropped in the compound
yaxw-nadjga- to kill . . . by means of a club (-nadjga- to kill).
Here, the verb -nadjga- seems to take the place of -dje, substituting
a different verbal activity for t h a t of striking.
   There are other verb themes which could be brought forward on
this point but these are the most illustrative and convincing. I t is
apparent t h a t the evidence as a whole is not entirely convincing:
we have, for example, no analagous forms with we-, ha-, or na- to
show the precise effects these elements have on the themes they
appear to modify (cf. 28—32).
   I n conclusion, then, we can only submit the above scheme as a
tentative explanation of the variations in theme form discussed
in the preceding sections. I t is not possible to do more with the
evidence at hand. Possibly evidence from related languages, if such
are still extant, will aid in clarifying the theme morphology of
Tonkawa: until such evidence is available, I am convinced t h a t
only tentative hypotheses such as this one can be advanced to
interpret the data.                     b. THEME A F F I X E S (40—82)
               (1) The Pronominal Affixes       (40—46)
                        40. General Remarks.
   Under this heading, we propose to discuss only the pronominal
forms affixed to the verb. The independent personal pronouns, the
demonstratives, and the interrogative pronouns will be separately
treated in sections 89-92. There, also, will be discussed the possessive
pronouns which are normally expressed separately. In a few relation-
ship terms, however, the possessive pronoun is prefixed to the noun:
these exceptional cases will be covered in the section on the kinship
terms (cf. 93—95).
   The only pronouns affixed to the verb theme, then, are those of
the subjective and objective series. Both of these are, upon occasion,
also expressed separately: this is done for emphasis (cf. 89—92).
   The object pronouns, except for t h a t of the second person, are
prefixed and occur as the first prefixes of a verb complex. The
second person pronoun object is suffixed. The subject pronouns are
all suffixed and generally occur in final position. I n the subjective
series, the singular, dual, and plural are distinguished; the latter
two by distinctive suffixes unconnected with those for the personal
pronoun. Only the plural is recognized in the objective series.

68                            HOIJER TONKAWA   The order in which the pronouns occur both with respect to each
other and to the other units of the verb complex is as follows:
First person singular, first person plural, or plural object pronouns —
Theme Prefixes —Theme—Theme Suffixes—Second Person Object—
Dual or Plural Subject — Theme Suffixes — First, second or third
person subjects — Theme Suffixes (in some cases).","[74, 75, 76, 77, 78]"

                CHAPTER I. PHONOLOGY (2—19)                           2. Introductory.
  The Tonkawa word is composed of two major units or sets of
units. The first of these is the theme or invariable portion of the
word form. These rarely stand alone but are completed in meaning
by several affixes which amplify the meaning of the theme and
serve to relate it to other words in the sentence. There is never any
difficulty in distinguishing theme and affix: the technique binding
them together is prevailingly agglutinative. Thus, in the following
forms:
            yamx-o'c            I paint his face
            ge-imax-o'          he paints my face
            yavnx-a'ha'a        I shall paint his facethe theme is yamx- or -imax- and the affixes, -o'c first person
singular present tense, declarative mode; ge- first person object
pronoun; -o' third person singular present tense, declarative mode;
and -a-ha'a first person singular, intentive mode.
   The theme in this particular case is disyllabic as are the vast
majority of verb and noun themes of Tonkawa. I t is evident, too,
that it changes in form according to its position in the verb: e. g.
contrast yamx- of the first example with -imax- of the second. This
alternation in phonetic form illustrates the most far-reaching
phonetic law in Tonkawa — that of vocalic elision by which every
other element in the theme (this rule does not apply to affixes) is
""reduced"", i. e., either loses its vowel altogether or has its vowel
shortened. I t follows, then, t h a t themes are built up, phonetically
at least, of smaller units which we shall call ""elements."" These
elements are, roughly speaking, of two types: simple elements,
composed of consonant plus vowel, and complex elements, composed
of consonant plus vowel plus consonant. Furthermore, these ele-
ments vary in form according to their position in the word — the
odd numbered elements having a ""full"" form and the even numbered
elements being ""reduced"" in form. The details of this phonetic law
must come later (cf. 5); the matter is mentioned here in order to
illustrate the fact t h a t the phonology of Tonkawa is best considered,
not as directly affecting the individual phoneme, but as affecting
combinations of such phonemes or elements. I n other words, the
basic word building unit (phonologically considered) is not the
individual sound but the element.
  As mentioned above, this peculiar alternation of elements is true
only of the theme. Affixes do not vary their form no matter what
   1
2                           HOIJER TONKA WAposition they hold in the word. Phonologically, then, there are
three types of element: simple theme elements, complex theme
elements and affixed elements — the first two sub-classes contrast-
ing with the last in phonetic treatment. Affixes fall also into two
divisions: those identical with a single element and those composed
of two or more elements. Disyllabic affixes are not separable,
however, and must be treated as units.
   Returning now to the word, we find it composed of several
element groups rather loosely bound together. The elements of any
one of these groups form a firmly knit unit — one that is rarely
(in the case of themes) or never (for affixes) separable. It appears
likely that themes represent the oldest of these structures; in fact,
as we shall see later (cf. 13) they are ""petrified"" formations. It is
not now possible to form new themes on the analogy of the old —
words in the language that can definitely be said to be new are
invariably compounds of older themes. Nor is it possible to vary
the essential structure of the theme except in a few rare cases.
   We shall then, consider the phonetic laws of Tonkawa as they
apply directly to the three types of word building elements and
how, in this indirect way, they affect the individual phoneme.","[10, 11, 12]"

                           INTRODUCTION.
    The Tonkawa appear to have been an important and warlike
 tribe living in central Texas during most of the 18th and 19th
centuries. From the scanty accounts of their culture which have
come down to us through mission and governmental reports, they
were a nomadic people living on the buffalo. Their myths and
stories, of which I have collected about thirty, give indications
of their dependence upon buffalo and deer, and, insofar as this sort
of evidence is reliable, indicate a Plains type of culture. A more
complete account of their culture — or, rather, of what little is
known of their ethnological relations — may be found in the Hand-
book of the American Indian, B. A. E. Bulletin 30, part 2, under
the heading ""Tonkawa"".
    The name ""Tonkawa"" is supposed by Gatschet to be derived
from a Waco word tonkaweya meaning ""they will stay together.""
I am unable to verify or disprove this etymology. The Tonkawa call
themselves didjganwa-didj, which may be translated as ""the
people.""
   Powell, in his linguistic classification, considered t h a t the Tonkawa
language formed an independent linguistic stock, i. e., was unrelated
to any other American Indian language. Certain lesser tribes — the
Yojuane, Mayeye, and Ervipianne — were certainly associated in
culture and may have spoken languages related to Tonkawa. I have
not had access to the material extant on these languages. Certain
other small tribes, notably the Sana (sometimes written Zana and
Chana), situated between the Tonkawa and the Coahuiltecan
speaking groups, may also have spoken a language related to
Tonkawa. Only fragmentary material on Sana is extant. Relation-
ship between Tonkawa and the Coahuiltecan languages has been
postulated: the difficulty of proving any such relationship lies in
the scarcity of material on the Coahuiltecan languages, a difficulty
that cannot, unfortunately, be remedied since these languages are
now extinct.
   The language groups mentioned above are probably the closest
to Tonkawa. There is also a possibility that it is very distantly
related to languages of the so-called Hokan group. I have not had
the opportunity of making an adequate investigation of this
possibility. So far as this work is concerned, then, it will.be necessary
to consider Tonkawa as an independent language: as one for which
no cognates have been proven.
X                               HOIJER TONKAWA   Tonkawa is now spoken by only six persons — all of them past
middle age. There are approximately forty Tonkawa (including
mixed bloods) who are living at present in the vicinity of Tonkawa,
Oklahoma. The language is not being learned by any of the younger
people and, with the death of the present speakers, will become
extinct.
   The following account of the language is based upon about
360 manuscript pages of text with accompanying grammatical
forms. All of this material was obtained from one informant, John
Rush Buffalo, who has the reputation among his people of being
the best of their story tellers. Most of this information was gathered
during the summer of 1928: additional material being obtained in
the winter of 1928 and on two subsequent visits. The work was
financed by the Committee on Linguistic Research in American
Indian Languages, and I am grateful to the members of t h a t
Committee — Dr. Franz Boas, Dr. Edward Sapir, and Dr. Leonard
Bloomfield — for their interest and cooperation. Dr. John R. Swan-
ton of the Bureau of American Ethnology very kindly sent me his
copy of the Tonkawa material collected by A. S. Gatschet in 18841.
The kinship terminology included in this paper was collected by
Dr. Alexander Lesser of Columbia University. I am particularly
indebted to Dr. Sapir for his careful reading of the manuscript
and the constructive criticisms he has unfailingly supplied.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"

                            83. General Remarks.
   We have seen, in the preceding sections, how the verb dominates
the Tonkawa sentence: how, by means of its theme and affixes, it
expresses and modifies the action and incorporates the subject and
object pronouns within its structure. However, few sentences are
complete without other words; words defining the subject and
object of the action, and words modifying the verb and its subject
and object. These, too may be studied in two sections: the theme and
its affixes. Themes of this sort are very similar to each other formally:
are, indeed, no different from the verb in formal structure save in
one respect — they have meaning when used apart from their
affixes, whereas the verb has full meaning only when used with its
formal affixes. Formally, then, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and
pronominal themes are similar and, in a good many cases, one theme
           HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES                    107can be used in any one of the four functions. The difference in func-
tion depends upon, first, the position of the theme in the sentence
and, secondly, upon the affixes it may take.
   Themes functioning as nouns and personal pronouns take certain
definite suffixes which define their relationship to the verb. De-
monstratives may also take such suffixes and are, in addition, often
found inserted between the noun and its formal suffix. Themes
functioning as adjectives are invariably placed between the theme
they modify (a noun functioning theme) and its formal suffix.
Themes functioning as adverbs take no suffixes whatever but are
placed — generally — before the verb themes they modify. In a
few cases, where no confusion will result, they follow the verb theme.
A Tonkawa sentence is, then, composed of a number of themes,
formally alike, each possessing characteristic affixes defining its
function in the sentence and its relationship to other words in the
sentence and each having a more or less fixed position in the
sentence. For example,
'egwan-edjodjxo'k-la ha^ago'n-gwa'lou-lak djigeu nadj-o' The bad dog severely
    bit a big manIn this sentence the themes are: 'egwan dog, hedjodjxo'k bad,
ha-'ago-n man, gwa-lou big, djigeu severely and nadje- to bite
The suffixes: -la nominative singular indefinite, -lak accusative
singular indefinite, and -o' declarative present, third person singular.
Neither hedjodjxo'k bad, nor gwa-lou big nor djigeu severely, function
exclusively as modifiers, hedjodjxo'k-la would mean ""a bad (one)""
or in the phrase hedjodjxo-k nadj-o' he bites him badly, would
function as an adverb; gwa'lou-la a big (one), or gwa-lou bandjal-o'
he opened his mouth widely; and djigeu-la the sharp (one), or
xal'o-n-djigeu-la a sharp knife.
   For this reason we have found it best to consider themes func-
tioning as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs as in the same category,
omitting only the pronouns (personal, possessive, and demonstra-
tive) because they have certain specialized functions.","[116, 117]"

                 C. SYLLABIFICATION AND ACCENT (19)
                     19. Syllabification and Accent.
   Each syllable of aTonkawa word must begin with a consonant
and, if possible, be composed of consonant plus vowel plus con-
sonant. Where there is a series of sounds of the type CVGVG, the
first syllable will be CV, the second, GVC. Examples of syllabifica-
tion:
        ne-bax-gan                 tobacco
        ne-bax-go'-c               I smoke
        yad-co'-c                  I stab him
        gei-da-co'                 he stabs meIf the vowel of a syllable be long, it need not be completed by a
consonant.
        ya'-djo'-c                 I see him
        ge-ya-djo'                 he sees m e
        ya'-be-djo'-c              I make clothes
22                           HOIJER TONKAWAIf, however, an element containing a long vowel be followed by a
consonant plus consonant, the first consonant must be included in
the first syllable. Thus :
        ga'l-wo'-c               I gamble
        bcrb-no'-c               I set the tableGlottalized consonants are treated as are any others in the syllabifi-
cation of a word-
        ha-m'am-      o'-c       I burn
        c'e'-l'o'-c              I scratch it   In all of the preceding examples, it will be noted that a final
consonant may comprise a syllable.
   Accent in Tonkawa is evenly distributed — each syllable receives
substantially the same accentuation. Occasionally, however, a
slightly heavier accent may be noted for the penult. Neither sylla-
bification nor accent seem to have any effect upon the phonology of
the word nor are any morphological distinctions entirely dependent
upon them.
             CHAPTER I I : MORPHOLOGY (20—96)
                         20. Introductory.
    The distinctive treatment accorded theme and theme affix is no
less important to the study of Tonkawa structure than it is for the
phonology. The theme, defined as the invariable portion of a word
form, carries the concrete significance of the word — the affixes
serve either to amplify (or restrict) this meaning or to relate the
word to the rest of the sentence.
    The theme can, then, be studied quite apart from the affix. The
rules governing its structure and the elements composing it, if they
could be isolated, would give information as to the ""prehistory""
of Tonkawa. That is, variation in theme form is not relevant to the
grammar of the language. But, the theme, as it exists today, is a
petrified formation and it is not easy to determine whether or not
it is analyzable into smaller morphologic units. We shall see later
that some themes yield to analysis and, on this evidence, it is
possible to speculate upon its former structure.
    Grammatical variations in Tonkawa words are accomplished
chiefly by affixation. The predominant grammatical process is
suffixation: the definite article, case, number, tense, mode, sub-
ordination, and aspect are all expressed by suffixes. Prefixes are
used much more sparingly — there are no more than six altogether.
They are more concrete in meaning than the suffixes, generally
adding significance to the word rather than serving to relate it to
other words in the sentence.
    The degree of cohesion between theme and affix is rather slight:
there is never any difficulty in breaking up a word form. In other
words, agglutination is the predominant technique, although there
is, in the case of a few suffixes, a tendency towards a fusional
technique. Verb prefixes and the case suffixes of the noun exhibit a
surprising lack of unity with and dependence on the theme. Between
a noun and its case suffix may be inserted two, or even three,
modifiers and there are many examples of such suffixes being quite
independent of any particular theme; serving, instead, to modify
whole clauses. To sum up, the variation in combinatory technique
is from a very loose semi-independent type of affix to a combination
of theme and affix rather firmly welded with decided dependence
of affix upon theme.
    To apply the classificatory notion of ""parts of speech"" to Ton-
kawa would be to do extreme violence to the spirit of the language.
I t is much more in accord with this feeling to divide all words into
24                             HOIJER TONKAWAtwo very general classes: independent themes, i. e., those which
can stand alone, and themes which must be completed in meaning
by one or more affixes. These are, of course, purely formal divisions.
The essential criteria of function are the affixes which may be
attached to the theme in question and the position that theme may
occupy in the sentence. Thus, the word,
        xa'x-ano'                  he is arriving
is composed of the theme xa~x- to arrive, plus certain verbal
affixes. But this complex may also take noun suffixes; thus,
        xa'x-ano'-'a'la            the one to arrive
where -'a'la is not an agentive or relative suffix but the regular
noun suffix for the nominative singular definite case. This variation
in function according to suffix and position is even more clearly
illustrated by the following where the same theme — t'cel up, above —
becomes either nominal, adverbial, or adjectival in function accord-
ing as these criteria are varied.
        t'cel-'a'y'ik ha'no'       he goes to the top
        t'cel ha'no'               he goes upwards
        na'don-t'cel-'a'y'ik       he goes to the top of the mountain
               ha'no'
In the first sentence, t'cel, used with a noun suffix is nominal in
function; in the second, standing directly before the verb, it is
adverbial; and, in the last, inserted between a noun and its suffix,
it has adjectival significance. ""Parts of speech"" in Tonkawa, then,
are, formally, simply two — independent themes and themes plus
affixes. The former includes words which may be nominal, adjectival,
pronominal, or adverbial in function; the latter, words having
verbal significance and particles.
   The Tonkawa sentence is dominated by the verb complex. It
includes the subject and object pronouns and defines the tense,
mode, and aspect of the action. It is rarely, however, that any verb
is equivalent to a sentence: other words are always necessary to
complete the proposition. The verb is the most complex in structure
and is generally synthetic with a tendency towards a polysynthetic
structure. Nouns generally take only two suffixes; the case suffixes
and the definite article. Modifiers, inserted between noun and case
suffix, complicate its structure: it is hardly possible, however, to
regard combinations of noun and modifier as unified word com-
plexes; they are better described as compounds.","[31, 32, 33, 34]"

                            53. The Negative Suffix.
   The negative of any verb may be formed by adding the suffix
-abe- directly to the theme. When, however, the verb takes the
second person object, this suffix is inserted between the theme and
the negative suffix (cf. 41). The order is, then, as follows:
   Theme — Second Person Object — Negative — . . .
The initial -a- of the suffix, when added directly to the theme,
obscures the form of the final theme element causing its vowel to be
-a- in either the full or reduced form.
             yagb-ab-o'c                   I do not hit him
             geigab-ab-o'                  he does not hit me
             yagb-abe-no'c                 I am not hitting him
             yagb-abe-nec'o'c              we two do not hit himWhen the verb takes the second person object, the vowel -a- of the
suffix is lengthened.
             yagba'b-o'c                   I do not hit you
             yagba-be-no'c                 I am not hitting you
             weigaba'be-no'c               I am not hitting you people
             yagb&be-nec'o'c               we two do not hit youI t is probable t h a t -abe- is an incorporated form of the adverb
gabai not, nothing, though no such relationship can be proven.",[92]
"Notice, in the last list, that the reduplicated forms repeat the second
element of the theme.
   This variation in phonetic behavior taken in connection with the
first example quoted on page 40 would seem to indicate that ha-
plus another initial theme element of the class of na- does not
elide according to the law of vocalic elision, whereas ha- attached
directly to a theme does vary phonetically according to this rule.
In other words, the themes of the first list seem to contain traces
of other theme elements of the wa-class: perhaps, at one time, there
was a complete list of such elements classifying various types of
object. This is, of course, only a suggestion: no further proof of
such an organization can be adduced.
   The test forms for ha- are more definitive than any discussed
heretofore. For example:
         yagona-                    to hit . . . with the fist tr.
         ha'gona-                   to box intr. (ha- plus ya- >     ha--)         yaxgoca-                   to follow . . . tr.
         ha'xaxgoca-                several go in single file
         yadca-                     to stab . . . tr.
         ha'daca-                   several stab each other; a fight with
                                         knives takes placeIn all of these forms, the addition of ha- appears to confine the
action to an object expressed within the theme: to make the action
intransitive as far as the English translation is concerned. We have
seen, however, that Tonkawa verbs do not fall into definitely
transitive and intransitive classes: that there appears to be no
consistently formal distinction between transitive and intransitive
verbs in Tonkawa. Rather, the question of transitivity seems bound
up with the analysis of the theme. Thus, while hangaba- is transitive
in the sense that it may take an object (ga-ngabo' it sticks to me;
hangaba-we' it sticks to you), the subject is limited to a certain
type of object apparently once clearly defined by na-, and ha- does
not affect the transitivity of the whole verb theme but expresses an
42                        HOIJEB, TONKAWAindirect relationship between the elements -n- and -gaba- of the
theme. In other words, the question of the transitivity of the whole
theme with regard to an object expressed by a theme affix is bound
up with the relationship — direct, indirect, or instrumental —
between elements of the theme. I do not believe, therefore, that ha-
is necessarily an element indicating the intransitivity of the whole
theme (indeed, that point is contradicted by many of the ha-
themes), but that it has to do with the more important relations
between elements of the theme in much the same way as ya- and ne-
appear to serve this function. The curious and apparently con-
tradictory facts of theme variation discussed so far can, at least
speculatively, be explained by postulating two theme elements
either standing in direct relationship one to another (the prefix-
less themes) or being indirectly related by one or other of the first
position themes elements (ha-, ne-, ya- themes). It is not necessary
of course, to assume that all themes have both these elements —
some of the prefix-less themes may be composed of only one;
others, which appear transitive, may have a limited transitivity
due to the inclusion within its structure of an element designating
or referring to a possible object (cf. 28). This theory of theme struc-
ture cannot be proven: but, as I have said, it appears to be an
hypothesis that does justice to the few test forms that exist. In the
following sections, we shall find further confirmation, or, rather,
further indications that this theory has some degree of validity.
                           32. he- Themes.
   The element he- is on the border line between the first position
theme elements which have been discussed and the theme prefixes.
In fact, there is no formal difference between he- and the reflexive
pronoun he- (cf. 43) except that the themes containing the theme
element he- cannot be used without it. he- also does not elide its
vowel when preceded by a single element prefix, a behavior
characteristic of theme prefixes.
          hedjn -o'                 he falls down
          ge'djn -o'                I . . . (ge- + he- > ge'-)
   There are a great number of themes in this class — it is the second
largest group of themes in Tonkawa, the largest class being the
prefix-less themes. The following list is arranged in order of in-
creasing complexity of theme form, the simplest coming first. Since
these themes have no reduced forms — or, rather, since their re-
duced forms are the same as the full forms — only two forms will
be given for each theme — the full form and the reduplicated form.

medio-passive significance to the theme — limiting the action to
the subject. It is evident, however, that this factor does not affect
the ultimate transitivity of the whole theme. For, though most of
the themes are intransitive or confined to a reflexive object, one
44                                HOIJER TONKAWAof them (e. g., hendaidja- to chew) is transitive. It is possible here
that -n- is the reduced form of -na-, the incorporated object (cf. 28),
and that the verb is therefore limited in transitivity. Just to what
spheres of influence these different elements are confined and how
they combine to result in the present meanings, cannot, of course,
be determined since we are unable to isolate the other theme ele-
ments. As was the case with ya-, ne-, and ha-, it is quite possible
that the function of he- is bound up with that of the other theme
elements and not with the formal relations of the whole theme to
its object.
   The test forms following confirm the impression that he- gives
medio-passive significance to the theme.
           daVew-                         to be one of a group
           he-dai'ew-                     to join a group
           ,ei-dai'ew-                    to place . . . with a group
Here, the first theme is used only passively (i. e., I am one of a
group; I am in the group; cf. 42), the second, medio-passively, and
the third is transitivized by the element 'ei- (cf. 33). Other test
forms follow:
           he-nc'o'ido-                   to stretch oneself
           'ei-noc'o'ido-                 to stretch . . .
           hv-n&idxzw'a-                  to move about, tremble
           'ei-nedidxew'a-                to move . . ., poke, jab . . .
It will be noted, in all the above forms, that the themes themselves
(viz., -dai'ew-,   -noc'o-ido-,   and -nedidxew'a-) are not transitive but
require the transitivizing element 'ei-. The function of he-, therefore,
seems to be to direct the action to the subject. If it is the reflexive
pronoun, it is evident that certain verbs can be confined — as
regards transitivity — to the reflexive: that the reflexive pronoun
is not functionally similar in type to the other object pronouns
(cf. 41). There is a possibility here that themes requiring he- were
originally simply transitive themes used exclusively with the re-
flexive pronoun: that, in harmony with the petrification that has
affected the Tonkawa themes, this he- prefix has become an irre-
movable theme element and, that, in the few forms in which the
theme can dispense with it, the theme is felt as intransitive. What-
ever the cause, there seems to be little doubt that he- themes
generally designate an action intransitive except as regards the
reflexive: i. e., a medio-passive construction.","[51, 52, 53, 54]"

  The prefixes are all mixed relational in character; that is, they
serve both to add significance to the word and to relate it to other
           HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN I N D I A N           LANGUAGES       25words in the sentence. They are all verbal prefixes — no noun
prefixes have been isolated. Three of them are pronominal objects,
ge- me, we- them, and geu- us, the last being a combination of the
first two (cf. 41). There are also two causative prefixes (cf. 50), and
a transitivizer restricted in usage to particular themes (cf. 36).
A prefix da-- is used in combination with the pronominal prefixes to
indicate the indirect object of an intransitive verb. Finally, there
is an adverbial prefix, xa-, x- to a distance, with force. Examples
follow:
        yamx -o'c                   I paint his face
        ge-imax -o'                 he paints my face

        'ei-gec'adjo'c              I break his (back)   Suffixes are much more numerous. They, too, are predominantly
mixed relational in form and, generally, those with greater concrete
significance come nearer the theme than those having less concrete
meaning (i. e., the more formal suffixes). Verbal suffixes are much
more dependent upon the theme than are the noun suffixes. The
latter, in fact, appear to have a semi-independent character as
illustrated in the following examples.
        yadjox'an -'a'lak           I see the tipi
             ya'djo'c
        yadjox'an -gwa'lou-awa-     I see the very tall, big tipi
             adak-'a'lak ya'djo'cIn the first sentence, the formal suffix - a-lalc is attached directly to
the noun yadjox'an, tipi. But, in the second the modifiers gwa-lou
big, hawai tall, and hadak very are inserted between the noun and
its formal suffix.
   I n the verb, the subject pronouns, number, mode, tense, aspect,
and subordination are indicated by suffixes. The suffixes of the
noun express case and the definite article: some demonstratives,
too, may be regarded as noun suffixes (cf. 91).

                             22. Compounding.
  Compounding is very free in Tonkawa. Almost any two verb
themes may be compounded and compounds of noun and modifier
are very common. In all such compounds, the second theme is
subordinate to the first. Examples:
        ga'n-aidjona-             to throw (it) up (haidjona- to
                                       move up)
        yagau-nadjga-             to kick to death (-nadjga- to kill;
                                       cf. 33)
        hedaVo'-he'cogyaw-        to join in a fight, war (he'cogyaw-
                                       to fight)
        yag-xailaha-              to shoot (e. g. an arrow) into (the ground)
                                       (xailah- to stick (a pointed object)
                                            in (the ground)
        gwe'-necdjodan            pencil (gwer stick, necdjodan writing)
        t'caxw-yabetc             thread (t'caxw cloth, yabetc sewing)A classification of compounds according to type and more examples
of them will be found in sections 36 and 85.
   As will appear later, the function of theme formation has been
lost in Tonkawa. All new ideas are expressed by compounding old
themes: as far as I can determine, no new themes have been formed
in the language for a very long time. It will appear, however, from
what little can be told of theme formation, that probably composi-
tion has always been important in theme formation. Themes seem
to be composed of smaller morphologic units (cf. 39); in an early
stage of the language, it may have been that such smaller units were
compounded to form the present themes. In the present state of the
language, we find compounds in all stages of growth — those of
two themes, either of which can stand alone; compounds in which
only one theme has an independent existence; and, finally, those
in which both themes have lost independent status. The latter are
classed as compounds because they follow a definite pattern of
behavior characteristic of compounds (cf. 36). More detailed material
will be presented on this subject in section 36: it is only mentioned
here for the purpose of showing the importance of composition as a
grammatical process.","[34, 35, 36]"

  A great number of verb themes may take this suffix which makes
them function as nouns. Examples:

becomes Co• and the noun suffix -n.

                 (e) The Modal Enclitics (76—82)
                      76. General Remarks.
  The modal suffixes added to the -k form of the theme may, in
most cases, also be added to nouns, adjectives or demonstratives.
The modes so formed are the declarative, interrogative, resultative,
hortatory, quotative, and certain subordinated modes.","[111, 112, 113]"
"Not only has ne- been added but an element -na has also been
suffixed to the theme (assuming that nogo- is the original theme).
-na may be the directive element ""off, away (from the speaker)""
found on many verbs and giving a progressive signification to the
action (cf. 34 for examples of such usages). Thus, the theme could
be translated ""to pick, gather together several objects progressively
(i. e., off in a line)"" — in other words, ""to braid"", ne- would,there-
fore, add derivational significance. The analysis is admittedly
speculative.
            gelne-                   to be drowned
            ne-geVe-                 to drown . . .
Here we have a clear distinction between a neuter intransitive verb
and an active transitive verb. It may be well to remark, however,
that this is but an isolated example — no such verbal distinction
is generally recognized in theme forms. Nor is it possible, in this
particular case, to determine how much of this alternation has been
caused by the change from -ne to -e and how much is due to the
addition of ne-.The evidence with regard to -ne, -e alternations are
few but they do indicate that -ne is a characteristic of some — not
all — neuter verbs and that -e generally appears in an active theme.
The transitive signification is probably not due to ne- since it is used
with transitives and intransitives. The only conclusion is that ne-
cannot be defined from this set of forms.

           HANDBOOK O F AMERICAN INDIAN          LANGUAGES               37In this case, too, we have an alternation of final theme elements
for which there is little definition possible (cf. 35). In view of this
fact, the ya-, ne- variation is not definable.
             co"" yana-               to swim off, away
             co'yada-                to swim (towards the speaker)
             nenco'yawa-             to swim with a burden; to ferry . . .
                                         across (e. g., to swim across hold-
                                         ing a bundle of clothes out of the
                                         water) In this case, two elements have been added, ne- and -n- and the
 final elements of the themes are varied, -na and -da are clearly
 definable as directives, the former referring to direction away from
 the speaker, the latter to direction towards the speaker (cf. 34).
 -wa appears to have a durative function — or, at least, appears in
 a good many themes expressing repeated or long continued action
 (cf. 45). -n- may be the reduced form of na- and ne- is evidently the
 element we have been discussing. If na- is defined as an incorporated
object (cf. 28), ne- would appear to establish an oblique relation-
ship between -co~yawa- and na-: thus, the complete analysis, ne-
with, -n- an object, -ccryawa- to swim duratively.
    The application of this analysis to other ne- themes requires, of
course, an analysis of the rest of the theme — a thing which is not
always possible. Thus: ne-gel-'e- could be analyzed: to do to . . . by
drowning — i. e., to d r o w n . . . — if we were sure that -e- could be
defined as an active transitive verbalizer — an element empty of
concrete significance but adding these more formal meanings to the
verb. This is not always possible (cf. 34).
   Our conclusions with regard to the definition of ne-, then, must
be that its meaning cannot be deduced with accuracy without
knowing quite a bit about the rest of the theme. This knowledge
is not available for all themes: there are simply a few indications
as to their structure (cf. 39). But we can suggest that ne- has to do
with the relationship between theme elements — that ne- themes
are three element themes in which the second and third elements
are indirectly connected through ne-.
                           30. ya- Themes.
   Themes having ya- as the first element are rather more numerous
than either of the two preceding groups, ya- is also a simple element
and has the reduplicated form yai-. This alone is unique; it will be
remembered that neither na- nor ne- were reduplicated. A number
of ya- themes repeat ya- in the reduplicated form; some repeat the
second element of the verb complex, and, for a few themes, both
types of reduplication are found. I t is not possible to place ya- with
38                            HOIJER TONKAWArespect to ne- since they do not appear in the same themes. Nor are
there any test forms to show its relative position with respect
to na-.

          HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN               LANGUAGES                39  There is the same difficulty with the test forms involving the
ya- element as we found in the case of the other two elements: they
are not sufficiently definitive. Take, for example, the following
comparison:
            nec-dige-                   to be cold, freezing
            ya-dge-, -i -dig-           to be frozen stiff
-dige- is not used alone but, since it appears with nee-, the causative
theme prefix (cf. 50), it can be defined ""to freeze, chill, be cold"".
But the use of ya- with the same theme does not alter the meaning
in a manner helpful to a definition of ya-.
            gam,namwa-                  to throw . . . with the hand (e. g. to
                                             throw a ball, stick, etc.)
            ya-ga'na'wa-                to swing (e. g. on a rope swing)
In this example, it may be seen that ya- appears to establish a
relation between the other elements of the theme. If we assume the
complex -na-wa- to mean ""moving through space (as if thrown)""
and ga~- to refer to an act of propelling or throwing (perhaps related
to ga--na- to throw . . . away, and ga~-da- to throw . . . towards the
speaker, where -na and -da are the directives, cf. 34), then ya-
would appear to establish an instrumental relationship between the
second and third elements of the theme. Thus, the whole form would
have the meaning ""to move through space by reason of throwing
(pushing, some means of propulsion)"" or, ""to swing"". The case is
necessarily weak since we cannot offer any evidence for the meaning
of the second part of the theme complex.
            yaxwdje-                    to strike . . . with a club
            yaxw-nadjga-                to beat . . . to death with a club
Notice, in this pair of forms, that the third theme element -dje is
dropped when the theme is compounded with -nadjga- to kill. That
seems to imply that ya-xw- means ""by means of a club"" and -dje
""to strike"". In other words, ya- establishes an instrumental relation-
ship between -dje ""to strike"" and -xwe- (the full form of -xw-)
referring to a club or stick. Unfortunately, there is no further
evidence for this analysis.
   In conclusion, then, we are left with the feeling that ya- is a
separable theme element possibly serving to establish a type of
relationship between the second and third elements of the theme
similar in form to that postulated for ne-, though, in neither case,
have we conclusive proof.                                31. ha- Themes.
  ha- represents an element of quite a different class from any of
the preceding — at least, as far as phonetic behavior is concerned.
In the first place, it precedes both na- and ya- in the verb complex
 40                        HOIJER TONKAWAand therefore, by implication, precedes ne- though there are no test
forms illustrating its use with ne- themes.
              hangaba-              (e. g., leeches) stick, are fastened
                                         to . . . ; to be stuck, caught fast
                                         (on some sticky substance)
              hanangaba-            several objects (e. g., leeches) stick
                                        to . . . ; it holds several fastThese examples, quoted before in section 28, illustrate the use of
ha- with a na- theme. It will be remembered that, in this case, ha-
seemed to indicate an indirect relationship between na- and gaba-;
that the form was tentatively analyzed as: an object (na-) is
fastened (-gaba-) to (ha-)....  Another curious phase of phonetic
behavior may be illustrated by this verb.
             hangab -o'             (leech) sticks t o him
             ga-ngab -o'            (leech) sticks to m e
Notice here that the addition of the single element theme prefix ge-
does not reverse the forms of the theme elements: -n-, -ga-, and -ba-
have the same form in the second example as they had in the first.
ha-, of course, is absorbed to the preceding prefix ge-, giving ga~-
(cf. 8). This behavior is characteristic of all ha- themes composed of

             27. The Two and Three Element Themes.
   In this section we shall list examples of the two and three element
themes (excluding, of course, those three element themes requiring
prefixes of any sort). These will be presented in order of increasing
complexity with the simplest types first. Whenever possible, three
forms will be given for each theme; the full form (i. e., the theme not
preceded by a theme affix), the reduced form (its form when preced-
ed by a single element theme prefix, cf. 5), and the reduplicated
form.
'ejr-, -'ge-, 'e'eg-                to give something to . . . tr.
bil-, -ble-, bilil-                 to roll, wrap tr.
             mam-                   to carry, pack tr.

The above is a fair sampling of the simplest form of the two element
themes; i. e., those composed of two simple elements. It will be
noted that, in the reduplicated form, the first theme element is
oftenest the repeated one and that it has the form GVCV.
   The following lists will illustrate themes in which the first element
is complex.

"   These noun suffixes may also be added to third person forms of
the verb and, in such an event, are translated as an agentive,
''the one who does so and so"". Examples:

,a%x-wa'-,a'-l-cogano,-,am-la  the one owning the waters (coga-n-o' he is

dodobo-k-lakno'o yaweno'-'a'-lak      she cut that b y which he was tied
     (yawe-n-o' he is being tied)Note, in the above examples, that agentive forms always require
the noun suffix for the definite.
  There are also a few examples of noun suffixes attached to verb
themes: such constructions are generally interpreted as subordinated
forms.

 cilweno-la cocgo-na-k-lakno'o while wandering about, he heard it, it is said
      (cilwe- t o wander about). This could also be interpreted "" h e wandering
      about heard it, it is said"", where ""he wandering a b o u t "" is the subject
      of the verb.

     he said, it is said (heilab- t o stand)
 xa'xa-l-ok ga'noc-la heilab-'a'-lak as he arrived, a Mexican (was) standing
        (there)    The suffix -laic is very often used independently or, at least, semi-
 independently, to set off certain word groupings. Its exact function
 in this connection will best be explained by a few examples. Thus,
 'e-l'ok 'a-x-'a--la x'adon--dak ye-la-k-lakno'o lak wa-y'ik 'e-da
 ha-'ago-n-ocac-wa--'a--la hadjxo-k-lakno'o which, translated literally,
 means: but the water very blue there was lak from this then that
young man arose it is said. The young man was a magician and had
turned himself into a patch of intensely blue water: his wife, looking
for him, could not see him but saw 'this patch of very blue water
from which that young man arose'. I t appears, then, that lak makes
the phrase 'a-x-'a--la x'adon--dak ye-la-k-lakno'o "" a (patch of) very
blue water was lying"" the object of 'e-l'ok which, as was shown in
section 38, is a particle based on the auxiliary verb: to be, to do.
Therefore, a free translation is ""(she did not see him) but (saw) a
patch of very blue water lying there from which, then, the young
man arose"", hadxilna-l-'ok ha-djcogonai-la heilab-e-la-k-lakno'o lak
da-dagxona-k-lakno'o when she went out Coyote was standing lak,
she brought him in, it is said. Here again lak refers the phrase
""Coyote was standing"" to the verb ""when she went out"" so that,
translated freely, the sentence means, ""when she went out (she saw
or noticed) Coyote standing (there); she brought him in, it is said"".
  In the examples to follow, the phrase objectified by lak will be
put in parenthesis.

objectified phrase (i. e., the phrase in parentheses) has compounded
with is the reduced form -e*- of the auxiliary ye-- to be (cf. 38);
and is, therefore, a static verb. The part of the expression in paren-
theses is this static verb and this totality is referred to the active
verb preceding by the element lak.","[124, 125, 126]"
"In this set of examples, the nec- of the first form is the causative
theme prefix (cf. 50): the form can, then, be translated 'to cause...
to be shut, closed, fastened', whereupon the meaning 'to be closed,
shut, fastened' can be attributed to -gaba-. hangaba- is conjugated
as follows:
      ga'ngabo'             (e. g. leeches) fasten to me; I am stuck fast,
                                 caught (by sticky substance)
      hangaba-we'           2nd p.
      hangabo'              3d p.
The function of ha- seems to be to establish a relationship between
-n- and -gaba- (cf. 31). The form ga-ngabo' may then be analyzed as
follows: g- me plus ha- to; -n- incorporated object of -gaba- to be
fastened. This analysis receives support from the reduplicated form:
Jmnangaba- several objects are fastened t o . . . ; the element -na-
being repeated.
   Applying this analysis to the other two examples, na-bacxa- may
be analyzed: na- object of -bacxa- to strike against, bump, thus;
to play shinny: whereas ya-bacxa- would simply refer to the bump-
ing of any object. In short, the latter is universally transitive — the
former transitive only within itself, i. e., has a limited transitivity.
na-lc'am'-e- illustrates this factor of limited transitivity even more
clearly: h'am'e- applying to the bending of any object, na-Jc'am'e-
only to jointed objects.
   I t is evident, of course, that this analysis is far from being a
thoroughly convincing one. I t is to be taken simply as a possible
explanation: it is obvious that the Tonkawa theme is a very old
formation and has doubtless undergone semantic changes since its
elements lost their independence and that such changes have
obscured the original meanings of the elements comprising the
themes. However, partial analyses of this sort (and of the sort
mentioned in section 27) give a strong indication that the theme must
have been, at one time, a less complex unit than it is today. Further
evidences of this fact will be found in the sections to follow.

   The element ne- is similar to na- in phonetic structure — t h a t is,
it is a simple element •— but it seems to have a different position
in the verb theme. This point is illustrated by only one example:
        na-m'ene-             to broil . . .
        ne-n -m'ene-          to roast, barbecue . . .
but there are a number of themes similar in structure to the second
form above. For none of these, however, are the primary forms
(i. e., those without ne- similar to nam'ene-, above) available, nere-
is not to be interpreted as a reduplicated form of ne- because, as
will be seen from the subjoined list, the reduplicated forms of ne-
themes repeat the second element of the complex.                               ne- themes.
nedle-, -ndal-, nedadal-              to lick . . .
nedjbe-, -ndjeb-, nedjedjebaw-        to put one's hand on . . .
nelde-, -nled-                        to pull out, pluck (e. g. feathers)
negewa-, -ngewa-,                     to be related to . . .

nex'abe-, -nx'abe-, nex'ax'abe-       to eat hackberries (the word refers
                                              to the cracking of the seeds of

nencona-, -nencona-,                   to kiss . . .
nenm'ene-, -nenm'ene-                  to roast . . . ; barbecue . . .
          (From nam'ene- to broil     over open fire)
nengo'na-, -nengo'na-                  to braid . . .
          (From nogo- to pick, gather several objects)
nenco'yawa-, -nenco'yawa-              to swim with a burden, ferry
           (From co'yana- to swim away)   Note, in the above list, t h a t the element ne- does not elide its
vowel in the reduced form of the theme. This is probably because,
if it did, the elision of the vowel would result in the total elision of
the element — i. e., the two consonants n would come together.
Such combinations are avoided in Tonkawa.

                  1 0 0 0 . ce-ndo'a-la       cikbaxThe word for the number ""one"" is simply we-'ic; -bax is an adverb
meaning ""only, just"". For ten the word is simply cik. All the
numbers except two, three, and five, are, then, based on the theme
cik. The word for six seems to be cik plus gwa-lau; the latter resembling
the adjective gwa-lou big, large. Nine is formed by compounding cik
plus we-'ic one, and xw'e-l'a, which resembles the theme xw'e-l- to
miss (a mark in shooting). In the word for seven, the suffix is
unknown; the word for eight is cigid four, plus an unknown suffix.
The theme cik corresponds to nothing else in the language.
   The teens are formed as follows:
           cikbax-'en    med'ic-'en                 thirteenThe suffix -'en is the conjunctive suffix for nouns which has been
discussed in section 86. The word thus reads ""ten and three"" =
""thirteen"". Twenty is formed by saying two tens; thirty by three
tens, etc. The word for one hundred is borrowed from the Mexican
ciento.

"                        (3) Theme Suffixes    (52—82)
                           52. General Remarks.
  All Tonkawa themes may be divided into two classes: those which
have meaning when used without formal suffixes, and those which
require formal suffixes to complete their meanings. Themes function-
ing as verbs fall largely into the latter class: the few verb
themes t h a t can stand without formal suffixes function as nouns
when so used (cf. 35). I n other words, all themes functioning as
verbs must employ one or more formal suffixes.
            HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN         LANGUAGES             81  The positions of these suffixes in the verb form vary according
to certain combinations which may be summarized, as follows:
       1. Theme — Negative suffix — Future tense — Dual or
          Plural — Pronoun.
       2. Theme — Negative suffix — Future tense — Dual or
          Plural — Continuative — Mode (declarative) — Tense
          (present or past) — Pronoun — Mode (interrogative).
       3. Theme — Negative — Future tense — Dual or plural —
          Pronoun — Mode (assertive or subordinating).
       4. Theme — Negative — Dual or plural — Mode (intentive,
          imperative, or potential) — Pronoun.
       5. Theme — Negative — Pronoun — -k — Mode (hortatory).
       6. Theme — Negative — Future tense — Dual or plural —
          Continuative — Pronoun         k — Mode (declarative, inter-
          rogative, resultative, quotative, or subordinating).
The first of the above schemes illustrates the simplest form in
which a verb may appear. This form is tense-less, except for the
future, and entirely mode-less. I t is used only in the first person
singular, dual, and plural and to express threatening or annun-
ciatory intention in direct discourse (cf. 54).
   It is evident that the tense suffixes are of two categories, the first
including only that for the future, the second those for the present
and the past. These two categories are not mutually exclusive: the
modes built up according to the second of the above schemes can
be sub-divided into four tenses: present, past, future of the present
(near future — sometime within the day), and the future of the past1
(remote future — sometime from tomorrow on to infinity). The
future suffix may also be used in other mode forms ordinarily tense-
less : only the intentive, imperative, hortatory, and potential modes
are completely tense-less. The future suffix used in otherwise
tenseless forms generally indicates an indefinite future (some
unspecified time in the future).
   It appears also that there are three modal positions in the verb —
the first before the pronoun, the second after the pronoun, and the
third attached to a -k (participial, cf. 74) form of the verb. The
declarative and interrogative modes may either be formed by
suffixes attached to a -k form or by means of scheme 2. These differ
in that the former connotes completed action (cf. 77). There is but
one aspect suffix — that for the continuative. This may be used in
all forms except the intentive, imperative, potential, and certain of
the subordinating modes.
   1 That is, the future tense suffix is employed with the suffix for the
past tense. This combination functions as a distant or remote future,
cf. section 55, IV.

82                               HOIJER TONKAWA  Finally, there are two other verb suffixes not illustrated in these
schemes. They are the -n suffix forming infinitives (cf. 73), and a
suffix -an changing a verb to a noun (cf. 75).","[90, 91, 92]"

           95. The Linguistic Form of the Kinship Term.
   I was unable to duplicate any of the vocative forms obtained by
Dr. Lesser. This does not, however, disprove those forms: my in-
formant was but poorly versed in the kinship terminology. I t may
also be mentioned that no other nouns in the language have vocative
forms.
   I did, however, record the addition of ""the initial i-"" mentioned
by Dr. Lesser for the third person forms. In my transcriptions, it
appears as 'e- and my be used in other than the third person
possessive.          , ,             , , ,
                 gaga , 'egah      mother s brother
                 gada\ 'egad        grandfather
                 gaca', 'egac      grandmother
                 ya-na', 'eyan     sister, w. s.
                 he-na', 'ehen     brother, m. s.
These alternations cannot be explained. Only for the last two
terms (i. e., ya-na', he-na') was there a difference in usage. The first
134                             HOIJER TONKAWAforms (ya-na', he-na'J were used with the regular possessive and the
possessives of the others were built as follows:
             ,
              ehen-,o-cik-,a~la                my brother, m. s.
             'ehen-'o-ni-k-'a'-la              your . . .,
             'ehen-'a'crla                     his . . .,
             'ehen-'o'-nec'eei-k'-œ-la         our (two) brother
             'ehen-'ew-o'c'eci-k'-a'-la        our brother
These m a y be analyzed as -we- to be, plus pronominal subject plus
participial -k plus the noun suffix for the nominative definite. They
could then be translated: the one who is . . . brother.
  I n a few kinship terms, another type of possessive was used.
                        'eca'             mother
                        ca-'eca'          my . . .
                        na-'eca'          your . ..
                        'a-'eca'          his . ..
                        geuca-'eca;'      our mother
                       wena-'eca'       your (pi.) .. .
Possessives of this t y p e appear in no other connection.
  Some t e r m s exist with a constant possessive of the type illustrated
above.                     j
                       ca-axan          my son
                       'e'dxan          son
                        ca-han            my daughter
                        'ahan             daughter
For these terms, the possessive existed (in this form) only in the
first person : other possessives were formed in the regular way using
the alternates given above as bases.","[143, 144]"

                           Coyote and the Monster.
   ha-djcogonai-la (1)      ha-nanoklakno'o (2)        'e'nola    iwdon-'a'y'ik
          Coyote         was going along, it is said   when      to a mountain
 haidjonad         heilabanoklakTio'o (3)    /    'e-l'ok (4)    na'don-wa'-a--
 ascending   he was standing, it is said.        I t happened    that mountain      (1) Coyote is said to be the owner of all the earth; his permission
  was invoked by hunters when they invaded new hunting grounds.
  The word is a compound of ha'dj land, surrounding country, and the
  verb theme cogona- to own, put away, which has apparently a suffix
  -i. It is possible that this final element is cognate with the -i element
 listed for nouns in section 84 and is to be interpreted as a noun forming
 suffix. There are, however, no other examples of such an alternation.
      -la is the nominative indefinite singular case suffix. It is notable
 that, all through the texts, the word ""Coyote"" always takes the
 indefinite form of the case suffix and is never followed by the
 demonstrative wa~- that . . . aforementioned. No other character in
 the myths is described in this manner.
     (2) Theme: ha-- one person moves, goes, plus -na directive suffix,
 off, away (cf. 34). Theme suffixes: -no continuative, -k participial
 suffix, and -lakno'o narrative suffix (cf. 81).
     This text selection illustrates nicely the wide usage of narrative
 forms so characteristic in Tonkawa. Note that every verb not
 employed in direct discourse or having subordinate function has this
 suffix. The suffix indicates that the events recounted were not
 participated in by the raconteur but that he is repeating the story
told him by others, who, in their turn, had it from some one else, etc.
 If the story had been the experience of the one who told it to the
present teller the quotative suffix would be used (cf. 81).
     (3) ""when, ascending a mountain, he was standing (there), it
is said"". The indirect relationship of na-don mountain, to the verb
haidjona- one person goes up, is expressed by -a-y'ik (cf. 86). The
-d suffix of haidjona- subordinates it to the following verb heilaba-
to stand. 'e--no-la, a particle based upon the auxiliary V - to be, do
(cf. 38), links the first phrase with the second thus, ""Coyote was
going along, it is said, when it happened that he, ascending a
mountain, stood (there), it is said"". The continuative forms of the
principal verbs add a connotation of customary activity: according
to the myths, Coyote spends most of his time wandering about and
intruding upon the affairs of others.
    (4) 'e'-l-'ok as it happened: V-, the auxiliary, plus the third person
form of the subordinating suffix -'ok (cf. 66). The particle here refers

aforementioned          below (it)            a large camp              there was, it is

arriving        at the last          as he arrived                inside the tipi
        ma-ganoklakno'o( 8)          /    'e-kla     ha-djcogonai -la    hagxonad (9)
they were weeping, it is said.            Then           Coyote             going inthe preceding action to that which is to come — note that all the
rest of the sentence is objectified by lak (cf. 86). The sentence reads,
then, ""as it happened there was a large camp below that mountain
lak"" and the function of lak is to refer this fact to that of Coyote
standing on the mountain. Freely translated, ""as it happened
(Coyote saw that) there was a large camp below that mountain"".
   (5) The demonstrative w - that . . . aforementioned, is used here
because the mountain has already been mentioned: to omit the
demonstrative would be to imply that the speaker was referring to
another mountain.
   (6) 'a-yai here has nominal function. Compare this usage with that
in line 3, page 141, where it has adjectival function (cf. 83, 87).
   (7) yadjox'-an camp, tipi, is formed from the verb theme yadjox' 'a-
to build a tipi, by the noun forming suffix -an (cf. 75).
   The combination yadjox'an-a-naxok needs no case suffix since
it is followed by the auxiliary verb ye-- to be, and the whole is
interpreted as a static verb, ""to be a big camp"", ye'-la-k-lakno'o is
the third person form of the auxiliary in the -k paradigm plus the
narrative enclitic. I t will be seen that this is an irregular third person
form, -la- being the third person suffix (compare with the -k
paradigm in section 74 and the ye-- paradigm for the present tense
of the declarative mode in section 77).
   (8) This sentence is remarkable for the number of subordinate
phrases: ""Coyote, descending, arriving at that big camp aforemen-
tioned, as he arrived at the last (tipi), they were weeping, it is said,
inside that tipi"".
   -wa~- is used with yadjox'an-a-naxok since it has been mentioned
before (cf. note 5).
   xa-xa- one person arrives, is analyzable as xa-ha--xa-; xa- (from,
to) a distance; ha-- one person moves, goes; -xa arrival suffix
(cf. 34).
   holau last, is here used as a noun. The idiom is curious: it is really
the first tipi that Coyote comes to but the last with reference to the
camp (i. e., a tipi on the outskirts of the camp).
   xa-xa-l-ok, cf. 66 and note 4.
   Note the meaning of 'a-yai in the complex yadjox1 an- a-yai-
142                                 HOIJER TONKAWA""hedju• 'e-gwa"" (10)           noklakno'o      / 'e-kla           gwa-n-wa--'a-la(ll)
 ""What        is it ? ""     he said, it is said.     Then t h a t woman aforementioned
""de-w'an        yadjox'an-dana-de'-la                didjgan-'a-ga      gab-a-we"" (12)
""this way              all of this c a m p               people         there are n o n e ""
   noklakno'o          ""hedjodjxo'h-la (13)           wedoxano'o"" (14)            noklak-
she said, it is said        "" a n evil one         has been killing them all   she said, it 'a-y'ik inside the tipi. Literally, the expression means ""under the
tipi"". Cf. note 6. Compare the meaning of yadjox'an tipi, here with
its meaning of ""camp"" in line 1, page 141. Probably yadjox'an-
a-naxok is better interpreted as ""many tipis"" than as ""big camp"".
    ma-ga- to weep, -no continuative suffix.
    (9) Three locative themes have now been illustrated in this text:
ha-idjo-na- one person goes up (line 2, page 140), ha-gla-na- one
person goes down (line 2, page 141), and ha-gxo-na- one person goes
in. These have been discussed and listed in section 34.
    (10) hedju• what ? (cf. 92); 'e~-gwa, auxiliary V - to be, do, plus the
mode suffix -gwa (cf. 58).
    (11) gwa-n woman, -wa~- that aforementioned. The demonstrative
is used because the woman was mentioned by implication in the
expression, ""they were weeping, it is said"" in line 4, page 141.
    (12) ""there are no people in all of this camp"".
   de--w'an towards this (way); de-- this, plus the dative (towards)
suffix (cf. 91).
    yadjox'an-dana-de--la. The suffix or theme -dana- cannot be
explained: it occurs in no other connection.
   didjgan person, plus -a--ga, nominative definite plural case suffix.
   gab- is probably a reduced form of the modifier gabai no, nothing,
plus -a~we, the declarative modal enclitic (cf. 77).
   The meaning of the sentence is, then, ""towards this direction,
this is an uninhabited (people-less) camp"": the speaker is probably
gesturing towards the camp (her tipi being on the edge) while
speaking. It is possible that -dana- is related to the verb theme
dana- several go off, and that the sentence means ""going off in this
direction the camp is uninhabited"". If so, this is a unique example
of a noun plus verb compound (cf. 85).
    (13) hedjodjxo--k, probably hedjodjxo-- to be frightened, plus the
participial suffix -k (cf. 74). The word would then mean ""frighten-
ing, fearsome"" rather than ""evil"".
   (14) we-, third person plural object, -doxa- to finish, do completely,
-re-, continuative, and -o'o, third person singular of the past tense of
the declarative mode, do-xa-, -doxa- is used idiomatically to mean
""to kill"": ordinarily it is found compounded with other themes, thus
'e'eyau-do-xa- to finish working ('e'eyaw- to work).

    (15) na-gw, interjection (cf. 96). ma-ga- to weep, -abe- negative
suffix (cf. 53), and -u imperative suffix (cf. 61). Note that the final
 -e of the negative suffix is colored to -o by the imperative suffix -u.
    (16) daxw- day breaks, -I-'ok subordinating suffix (cf. 66).
 ""when day breaks, morning comes"" idiom for ""tomorrow"".
    (17) da-- postposition, with (cf. 48), he-cogyaw- to fight (intransi-
tive), and -a-ha'a, intentive suffix (cf. 60). he-cogyaw- is unex-
plainable but may be connected with cogo- to put away, and cogna-
to own.
    (18) galdei outside, plus the noun suffix for the dative, galdei may
also be used adjectivally.
    (19) ha-dxil-na- one person goes out, cf. note 9 and section 34.
    (20) This modal form — if it is a modal form — is unique. The
suffix -you appears in no other connection: here it seems to sub-
ordinate the expression ""he will fight with him"" to the following
""he says"". Thus the sentence reads, ""Coxote says that he will
fight with him"".
    (21) no - to say, plus -n-, continuative suffix, and -a'a, assertive
suffix (cf. 56).
    (22) yalxilna- to run away, plus the negative suffix -abe and the
imperative suffix -u. Note here, as in note 15, that the final -e of the
negative suffix becomes -o before the -u of the imperative.
    (23) One of the more interesting Tonkawa compounds: ya-dje-
to see, look, plus xw'e-la- to miss (e. g. a mark when shooting). The
combination is invariably found with the negative suffix and thus
forms the verb ""to not miss seeing . . . "" , i. e., ""to watch closely"".
That it is a true compound is seen here by the position of the first
person pronoun ge- between the two themes (cf. 36). Note here, too,
the vocalic coloring of the final vowel of the negative suffix -abe
(cf. notes 15, 22).

very loudly       he howled, it is said.           And        towards the south
   (24) ge-cxaya- night falls, plus the subordinating -gwa suffix.
Note the lengthening of the final vowel of the theme (cf. 67).
   (25) degal refers to a species of very hard wood which I have
been unable to identify. It was used in the old days to make
bows.
   (26) This verb is a compound of yaxw-, from yaxwdje- to strike . . .
with a weapon, and gaidje- (my finger, etc.) has been chopped off,
(used in a static sense only, cf. 42). Note the loss of the final element
of the first theme when compounded — other material on this
alternation will be found in section 39.
   (27) nec-, causative prefix plus ham'am'a- to burn, (intr.). Note
the use of gaxau black, as an adverb.
   (28) ho-c early, plus daxco-n (formed from daxco•- day breaks, by
the noun forming suffix -an, cf. 75) ""morning"", hadjxo- to get up,
arise. Note that the compound ho-c-daxco-n has no case suffix: it
functions here as an adverb.
   (29) daxac sun; haidjoda-k, -k participial form of ha-idjo-da- one
person comes up; -e~- demonstrative ""that"" (cf. 91); -w'an dative
(towards) suffix, daxac-aidjodak is regularly used to refer to the
east.
   (30) yel- to sit down, plus the directive suffix -na off, away: thus,
-yel-na- to sit towards (an object off in the distance).
   (31) hexcaca- to yell, yelp, howl, hawa.dak, (excess length rhetor-
ical) here used adverbially, a compound of hawai tall, loud, and
hadak very. Note that the final -i of hawai has been elided in the
compound. Note also the meaning of hawai in this context: cf.
section 87 for examples of such variations in the meanings of
modifiers.
   (32) yandan wind; hawai long, yandan-awai long wind, is regularly
used to denote the south in evident reference to the constant south
wind prevailing in the American Southwest. Compare this meaning
of hawai with that in note 31.

"
                            II. The Dative Suffixes.
   There are, as we have seen, two dative suffixes. The former one
  a-y'ik, is most commonly used. It carries with it an ""endpoint""
notion; the concept of ""(arriving) at, to, in (a certain point)"". The
other, -'a'-w'an (used mostly with verbs of going) implies a motion
towards an indirect object. Examples:
t'cagau-'a'-y'ik      wa'na-k-lakno'o      he fell into the river, it is said
yadjox'an-'a'-y'ik         xadxa-nec'e-k-lakno'o        they two arrived at the tipi, it
      is said
madjxanan-'a'-la          ca'hal-'a'-y'ik     heilaba-no-k-lakno'o     his sweetheart was
      standing a t the door, it is said
ha'dj-'a'-y'ik    hagxona-k-lakno'o        he (Turtle) went into the ground, it is said
'awac-wa'-'a'-lak       dja'l-'a'-y'ik     nadje-k-lakno'o      he bit that buffalo (in)
      the testicles; bit that buffalo's testicles, it is said
yadxan-'a'-y'ik        may'an-wa'-'a'-lak        yal-dadamaxe-k-lakno'o     he threw that
      turtle on a stone, smashing him, it is said
dana-nec'e-k-lakno'o         yadjox'an-'a'-w'an        they two went towards the tipi,
      it is said
nando'on-'a'-w'an          da'da-no-k-lakno'o        he started off with her to the
      mountains, it is said
hemama'go'-dana-k-lakno'o             yadjox'an-'a'-w'an      they went off, weeping, to-
      wards their tipis, it is said
gwa'n-la hedjne-k-'a'-w'an           hedjne-k-lakno'o     he (made to) lie down by the
      side of) the woman, it is said
          (Note that -'a'-w'an is used instead of - ' a ' - y ' i k , showing that he did
          not actually lie down by the woman but simply started to do so and
          was stopped.)
na'don-'a'-lak       necgaldei-'a'-w'an      yag-xailaha-k-lakno'o      he shot (an arrow)
      in the ground on the other side of the mountain, it is said
          (-'a'-w'an     is suffixed to the word meaning 'other side': he shot
          towards the other side so that the arrow would be stuck in the ground.)
                           III. Instrumental Suffixes.
  These are distinguished for definite and indefinite (indefinite -ec,
definite a--lac) and there occurs, but rarely, a plural definite
form (-a'-gai).       Examples:
             HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES                           117yan'a'nwan-el'a'd-ac by means of this chain

     to him by means of his chest
                             I V . Other Suffixes.
  Possession between two nouns is indicated by a suffix                      -'an
attached to the noun denoting the possessor.
hebaixwedan-ocac-wa'-l-'an x'a'i-'a'-la the young lady's mother

     daughter of that big Mexican chief, it is said
'awac-wa'-'a'-lak cogano'-'a'-l-'an 'o'dja-'a'-la the children of him who own-
     ed that buffalo   Conjunction is expressed by means of a suffix -'en which may
either be attached directly to the nouns involved or to the noun
plus nominative suffix. Examples:
heigwedjan-'en heixaxal'an-'en henenwan-'en rings and ear-rings and red
     paint and . . .
hcr'ago-n-ocac-la-'en hebaixwedan-ocac-la-'en a young man and a young wo-

 118                              HOIJER TONKAWA   A suffix -'ida, -da meaning (two, three, etc.) of them may be
 added to numerals and other words defining quantity or number.
 Themes taking this suffix require no case suffix. Examples:
cigid-'ida 'e'-n-o'o-lok there are four of them
ha'dj-'ida cocoyana-nec'e-k-lakno'o        both of them swam away, is is said
ha'naxok-'ida    weda'ho'-k-lakno'o      many of them met them, it is said

                    87. Themes Functioning as Modifiers.
   It is only necessary here to list a number of text examples to
illustrate the varying positions and functions of the themes com-
monly used as modifiers since, as we mentioned before, there
structure is similar to that of the noun functioning themes.                           'a-yai down, below, under
heilaban-'a'yai-wa'-y'ik      hedjne-no-k-laleno'o   he was lying under that tree,

      eamp a t the foot of that mountain, it is said
         Note, here, t h a t the complex yadjox'an-a'naxok         takes no case suffix.
         This is because it precedes the auxiliary ye'- to be, and, as such, is a
         part of the static verb "" t h e r e is a big c a m p "" .
'a'yai-wa'-y'ik    yela-da sitting down inside, . . .
yadjox'an-'a'yai-'a'-y'ik      ma'ga-no-k-lakno'o      someone was weeping inside
      that tipi, it is said
na~'e'-d na'don-'a""-lak     'a'yai-wa'-y'ik     they went to the other side of the
      mountain
         I n this sentence, the theme 'a'yai is separated from the noun na'don
         and given its own noun suffix. Literally, the sentence reads "" t h e y
         went the mountain (accus.) to that inside"". T h a t is, "" t o that inside the
         mountain"" means idiomatically "" t h e other side of the mountain"".

-dak. Thus,

"   (49) Note that two different verbs ""to come running"" have been
used: yandjidjxilda- and hengwa-da-. There are two others: ya-ncxil-
to run away, and yalxilda- to come running. Except that the third
of these cannot take the directive suffixes, no differences in meaning
can be distinguished.
   (50) ha-nadjidjxile- several run away, can only be used with a
plural subject. Note that ha-naxok many, is here used adverbially,
and that didjgan, though actually referring to many people, has the
nominative definite singular suffix. Literally the sentence reads:
""then person many several-ran-out-it-is-said"".",[157]
"The peculiarities of this conjugation are unique. First, notice the
second person forms: evidently the suffix -gwa has combined with
an unknown suffix for the second person pronoun, but is is entirely
impossible to say where the division should be made. Note, also,
the irregular third person plural. I t is possible here t h a t we have the
full form of the suffix in -yagwa, the preceding -ya- pluralizing the
pronoun. If this is so, it must be assumed t h a t the -ya element of
the suffix has been totally elided in all the other forms of the verb,
leaving behind it only the compensatory lengthening of the vowels
of the elements preceding -gwa. And, finally, there is a striking
similarity between this paradigm — especially the third person form
— and t h a t discussed in section 57. I t is possible t h a t this has
substantially the same meaning as the -gwa mode save t h a t it
carries a subordinating connotation as well. Text examples follow:wa'anec hedew'an'ax wa'na'-gwa-nec genecyaxa-u as soon as I fall to the

  This suffix is added to a constant theme, i. e., one not conjugated
for person and number. Person and number are expressed by the
principal verb for the two verbs. Text examples:
nex'eu-'a'lak nog-an 'eiwendjaganaklakno'o taking the gun, he killed them,
     it is said
'awac-wa""-' a'la holgam'adjxe-dan-'an   hewawad xe'djneklakno'o the buffalo

     the buffalo he filled four sacks with meat
'a'xwa necangwa'n-'an 'eigagaidjedanaklakno'o     he, too, making (his horse)
     run, went along chopping it (down), it is said
' awac-wa'-'a'la ha'n-'an didjgan heigo'od that buffalo, going off, transformed

'awac-'a'lak naul-'an yaxanoklakno'o cooking the meat, he ate it, it is said                      69. The Suffix -Vila while, when, as.
   With this suffix, too, person and number are expressed by the
principal verb for the two verbs. This suffix may be used with the
future tense suffix but not with the continuative. I t serves to relate
two verbs defining actions t h a t take place simultaneously or
nearly so. Generally, it appears t h a t the action defined by the
principal verb results from t h a t of the subordinated verb •— but it
is clear t h a t both actions then continue together. Thus, in the
following example,
x'ax'ai'anoklakno'o    weyadje-l'ila   he laughed when he looked at themthe context is as follows: a boy, seeing his uncles with shaven heads,
is moved to laughter and continues to laugh as he looks at them.
Examples:
cax'ai yagew-a'do-1'ila xal'o'n-gak gegbayo-l-ga'ak no'n-o'c I am saying (that
     I) will make arrows but have no knives

                              70. The Suffix -d.
    This suffix is added to the constant theme and may be used
together with the future tense suffix or the continuative. I t
characterizes a verb whose action immediately precedes that of
the principal verb. In some cases — as in the first example below —
the two actions take place together: the combination, in the example
mentioned, is practically a compound verb, viz., hedjne-d       maga-
"" t o lie weeping"". An interesting proof of the validity of such
compounds is found in the following example:
ba'bna-d   yaxa- to set the table to eat (yaxa- to eat)
ba'bna-d   yax-an table; that which is set for eatingwhere the combination is made a noun by the noun forming suffix
-an. That the suffix nominalizes the whole compound and not
only yaxa- is clear because the word yax-an also exists but has the
meaning ""food"". Examples:
hedjne-d, ma'ganoklakno'o       he lay crying, it is said
cocgona-d xadjloklakno'o        hearing it, she became angry, it is said
hewawa-d xe'djneklakno'o         he fell down dead, it is said

      is said

      they chased those buffaloes, it is said                           71. The Suffix -da and.
  This suffix is also added to the constant theme and may be used
with future tense or continuative. Examples:
no'-da hengwa'na-gwa       he said and started off
necgaba-da haxeineklakno'o        he shut the door and went off, it is said

                             72. General Remarks.
  There are two participial suffixes in Tonkawa, -n and -k. The
former has been referred to as an infinitive suffix since it is added to
the verb form not conjugated as to person and number. I t is used,
however, as a third person plural in the -k paradigms.","[106, 107, 108, 109]"
"Note, in the third person plural, t h a t -n replaces -k. The -n so
substituted is probably cognate with the infinitive -n\ i. e., the
infinitive is used idiomatically in the third person plural.
   -k forms may be used alone, with noun suffixes, or as bases for
the modal enclitics. The last named will be discussed in the section
following. The first two usages have a variety of functions, for
example:
hexaVoi hw'ac 'e'nok genana'djo'nogwa there are many ants biting me,
       hexaVoi ants, ha""'ac many, and V - , auxiliary to be, plus -no con-

                          I. Interjections.
  There are in Tonkawa two classes of interjections, the first com-
prising exclamations having fairly definite meaning and the second
including those expressive of emotional states. They are as follows.
                  'ana                look there, see it!
                  'a'g ai             no!
                     'ai'                 oh, all right!

indicative of emotion.

                                       II. The Curses.
  All of these, except one, are meaningful words used in a profane
context.
          hemayan                   ghost!
          hemayan cilwan            ghost wanders!
          hemayan'dak cilwan        ghosts wander!
          hemayan gadau             m a y you give b i r t h to a ghost!

                                                         ghost!
The above increase in intensity from hemayan, a fairly mild oath,
to hemayan gadau cilwan, which is the very acme of profanity. The
same series may be gone through, substituting 'egwan dog, for the
word ""ghost""; or 'ix evil, for ""ghost""; and, finally, 'idjxic, a word
of no meaning. These are not so seriously taken: to swear by the
ghost is the most profane.","[144, 145]"
"
               7. The Simple Element in Final Position.
   Simple elements in final position always have the reduced form
regardless of whether the position is even or odd in number. The
final form of the element differs from the reduced form in that the
consonant is not lengthened. By 'final position' is meant either
absolute or relative final: in most cases, theme elements can only
be relatively final since it is necessary to complete a form by means
of formal suffixes.
        no-w-o'c                   I lose (gambling)
             nou do'xo'c           I lose all
        he-i -la-b -o'c            I stand
             he-i -la-b hadjxo'c   I stand up, arise
In the above examples, the final elements happen also to be in even
numbered positions. If, however, the final element is in odd position,
the penult is even and should have the reduced form. But, because
of the rule acquiring the final element to be reduced no matter
what its position is with reference to the word, the penult re-inserts
its vowel — takes the full form. Thus:
        no-d -x(a)-o'c             I hoe it
        no-do-x                    hoe
Here, -do- is in the second position but -xa, which has the third
position, is reduced because final, causing -do- to re-insert its vowel
and take the full form. Other examples:
        ya-b -dj(e)-o'c            I sew it
              t'caxw ya-be-tc      thread

             xa-djo-i             gonorrhea
        'a-c -ya-w -o c           I am pregnant
             'a-co-i              pregnant
                  8. Total Elision of Simple Elements.
   Three kinds of simple elements, those with initial consonant h-,
y-, or '-, are elided completely under certain circumstances. Since
the factors governing such elision vary for the three element types
concerned, they must be considered separately.                        h- as Initial Consonant.
   Simple elements with h- as the initial consonant — unless in the
first position of the word or followed by certain theme affixes — are
absorbed to the vowel of the preceding element. Thus:
        'e--da--we'c                I come here
        'e~-dah( a)-a'dono'c       I will come here
        nec-'e'-dah(a)- a'we'      he makes you come hereIn the first example, -ddha- has contracted to -da--; in the second
and third examples, the addition of the theme suffixes for the
future tense and second person pronoun object respectively has
caused a long vowel to follow -ha- whereupon it cannot contract
with the preceding element -da-. Note, in the last two examples,
that -ha-, being in the fourth position, should have the reduced
form but that the theme suffixes following obscure the issue. Other
examples follow:
        ha-i -x -o'c             I ride it
        ga'-yo-x -o'             he rides me
     Notice here that the initial ha- of the theme contracts with the theme
     affix ge- me, and that the resulting contracting element has a long
     vowel, compensating for the loss of the element.

regular rule — appearing as CV in the full form and C in the reduced
10                              HOLTER TONKAWAform. There are, however, a few examples of such an element being
completely elided.

Examples of this type of elision are not common: the above list is
practically exhaustive.                      '- as Initial Consonant.
   There are only two examples of elements of this type in the even
numbered position. In these two cases, the element is completely
elided and the vowel of the preceding element is lengthened com-
pensatively.
        'e-g -o'c                    I give it t o h i m
               ge'-g-o'              he gives it to me
               we'-g -o'c            I g i v e it t o t h e mIn the above examples, the glottal stop of the reduced element
probably merges with, or drops out before, the following stop
consonant.
        he-i -'a-djew-o'c            I watch it
               yar-dj -o'c           I see it
There is reason to believe that the two themes go back to the same
source, ya-dje- (* ya-'a-dje-) being the simple form, having elided
the second element completely. In the second example, the prefix
he- (and the suffix -wa) have been added, reducing the first element
of the theme and allowing the second to appear. Curiously enough,
however, the element ya~- of ya~dje- is no longer felt as ya'a- but
follows the elision pattern of a type CV~ element (cf. 11). Thus:
        yam-dj -o'c                   I see him
               ge-ya -dj -o'         he sees me

  We have already listed the types of complex elements and given
examples of them (cf. 5). They may be regrouped as follows:
                 CVw (Co-)         CV-          C'V
                 CVy (Co-)         C'V-         CVC

          HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES                          11In the first column will be found those elements having two forms,
the uncontracted, CVw, CVy, and the contracted, Co• in both
cases. Neither form is affected by the position of the element in the
word. The elements in the second column are those having a long
vowel in the full form (i. e., when the element is in the odd num-
bered position) and a short vowel in the reduced form. The elements
of the third column do not vary in form at all.","[18, 19, 20, 21]"
"   The diphthongs are all falling diphthongs; i. e., the second vowel
is subordinate to the first. In all cases, there is a slight length to the
first vowel giving the diphthongs a full two morae length.
   The vowel e, preceding an element with a vowel a or o takes on the
quality of the vowel following. Examples:

a vowel or h, becomes w.

  The consonantal scheme has the rather unique feature of globaliz-
ed nasals, spirants, sibilants and laterals. These glottalized con-
sonants, as well as the glottalized stops, appear almost exclusively
as initial consonants of complex elements (cf. 13). The question of
their being basic consonants is, therefore, contingent upon the
structure of the complex element. As will be shown later, the
complex element is not always susceptible to closer analysis: for
this reason and because of the rarer cases of the occurrence of
glottalized consonants in unanalyzable forms, these consonants
have been listed as on a par with the others. The bilabial stop b
never appears in the glottalized form even when it is the initial of a
complex element comparable to those requiring a glottalized
initial consonant. A unique feature is the glottalized gw', in which
the glottal stop affects not the stop but its labialization. This
feature is, however, congruent with the rest of the system: in all
cases the glottal closure survives the oral closure and, when the
nasals, spirants, sibilants, and laterals are glottalized, the glottal
stop always follows.

   The voiceless media (b, d, g, gw) are pronounced in a manner
about halfway between the corresponding English surds and
sonants; somewhat as the b, d, and g of the central German
dialects. They occur in all positions — initially, medially, and
finally. In the final position, g becomes the surd -Jc.

 tion: sh pronounced halfway between English s and sh. It occurs
 in all positions, x, xw, vary in pronunciation between the guttural
 and palatal. Before or after back vowels (a, o,), they are guttural;
 before or after the front vowels (e, i,), they assume the palatal
pronunciation of the ch of German 'ich'.
    dj varies with dz. It is approximated in pronunciation by the
j of English 'judge'. In the final position it is entirely unvoiced, -tc.

The semi-vowels w and y, in the final position, become -w and -i,
respectively.

                     A. THEME ELEMENTS ( 5 — 1 3 )            5. Full and Reduced Forms: Vocalic Elision.
   Before entering upon the explanation of vocalic elision — the
most important single phonetic alternation affecting the theme —
it will be necessary to define more accurately the various types of
theme elements. We have already called attention to the fact that
there are two main types — the simple and the complex. The
simple element is composed of consonant plus vowel; the complex
element, generally built up of consonant plus vowel plus consonant,
has several types. In the following list of types of theme elements,
C is to be read as any consonant and V as any vowel. The lower
           HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES                        5case letters refer to specific consonants and vowels and a period
after a letter indicates length.
                     Simple: CV
                     Complex: CVw      CVy
                              CV-
                              CVC       CVC
                              C'V       C'V-
                              C'VC      cv-c
The first two types of complex element (CVw and CVy) may, under
certain conditions, appear in the form Co• (cf. 10). They are found
only in the final theme position; i.e., directly before the first suffix
position. The others, for the most part, occur only in positions
other than the final though there are a few cases of a type CVC
element in the last position. In the examples that follow, the
complex elements are set in black faced type.

      k'am'e-                   to bend around (e. g. bend soft metal
                                     into a bracelet)
      c'eTe-                    to scratch (e. g. a match)   The criterion for the distinction between simple and complex
elements is the law of vocalic elision. According to this rule, simple
elements vary in form according to their position in the word. Those
elements in odd numbered positions (i. e., first, third, fifth, etc.)
have the full form (CV), and those in even numbered positions are
reduced (C~). Complex elements of types CV', CV'C, C'V"", and
C'V'C, in the even numbered position, reduce the length of their
vowels, becoming CV, CVC, C'V, C'VC, respectively. The complex
elements CVw and CVy have the same form in both positions even
when they have contracted to Co\ The remaining types (CVC,
C'V, and C'VC) have the same form in both positions. In the
following paragraphs the law will be considered in its application to
each type of element and examples of its workings will be given.

                                  A. THE SIMPLE ELEMENT ( 6 — 8 )                       6. The Simple Element.
   The simple element has been defined as consonant plus short
vowel. It has three forms depending upon its position in the word.
In the full form, it appears as CV, in the reduced form as Cm, and
when in the final position it takes the form C. It will be noted that,
in the reduced form, the consonant is lengthened compensatively
for the loss of the vowel. If the consonant happens to beTO,n, or I,
this lengthening gives it a syllabic quality. The final form of this
element will be discussed in detail in the following paragraph —
certain other changes occur which do not directly concern us here.
               ya-d'-c(a)-o'c                   I stab him    ya-, being in the first position, has the full form; -d'-, in the
    second position, has been reduced from da; -c(a)-, in the third
    position, should have the full form but, being followed by the
    theme affix -o- merges with it to form -co- and the full form is
    not evident. The word as it actually appears is, then, yadxo'c
    'I stab him'.
               ya-i -da-c -o'c                  I stab him repeatedly    Here, ya- is reduplicated and the repeated portion, in the
    second position, is reduced: -da-, in the third position has the
    full form; -c-, in the fourth position, is reduced from ca but
    again merges with the following -o- affix to form -co-, obscuring
    its actual form. The word: yaidaco'c. It is necessary to note
    here that other theme suffixes besides -o- have certain effects
    upon the final element of the theme obscuring its real form.
    These will be discussed in sections 15 to 18.
               ge-i -da-c -o'                   he stabs m e     Here the theme affix ge- has been added, causing the first
     element of the theme (but the second with reference to the
     word) to have the reduced form (from ya) and the others to
     take forms suitable to their positions in the word.
           ge-ya-i              -da-c   -o'     he stabs me repeatedly     Here, ge- is added as in the previous example but, since a
     reduplicated element has the same form in both even and odd
     positions, there is no change. Other examples:
        ya-m         -x(a)-o'c                  I p a i n t his f a c e
        ge-i -ma-x               -o'            he paints m y face
        ne-d        -1(e)-o'c                   I lick h i m (with tongue)
        ge-n -da-l -o'                          he licks m e
        ya-l       -b(a)-o'c                    I s t i c k it (in t h e g r o u n d )
        we-i -la-b -o'c                         I s t i c k t h e m (in t h e g r o u n d )
           HANDBOOK O F AMERICAN INDIAN              LANGUAGES                7   When reduplicated, simple elements have either the form CVC
or CVCV. The former is the one we should expect to find. I t is
possible that those elements reduplicating according to the latter
pattern (CVCV) are older complex elements of the type CV-
(which, in the reduplicated form, becomes CVCV; cf. 11) which
have lost all characteristics of that class except the reduplicated
form. Another explanation would ascribe such forms to analogy
with complex elements of the type CV'. No proof can be adduced
for either theory.
          'egro'c                I give it to him
                'e'ego'c          rep.
          gwedo'c                I carry him in my arms
                gwegwedawo'c      rep.
          djexo'c                I turn him loose; loosen him

          gomo'c                 I have it in m y mouth; suek it
                gogomo'c          rep.
      For this verb there is some doubt as to the status of the element go-.
      Note the following:
           wo-g-m(o)-o'c         I have them in my mouth
           wo-go-m -o'c          I have them in m y mouth      In the first example the element -go- is elided as it should be if it is a
      simple element. But the second example can also be used. This fact,
      taken in connection with the reduplicated form of the element, lends
      a certain weight to the theory that -go- is a complex element of the
      type CV' which has lost the vocalic length of the full form and is
      treated in some cases as a simple element. Doublets of this type are
      very rare.

tions, reduplications of the form CVCV occur most often when the
element is the first of the theme and that the other type of redu-
plication is confined to second position elements. This fact is born
out by the mass of my material: only one element, the ya- as
illustrated in yagwa- to kick, consistently taking the reduplicated
 8                              HOIJER TONKAWAform CVC in the first position. A contradiction, however, to the
notion that the type of reduplication may be dependent upon the
position of the element is that the reduplicated form of either type
is consistent no matter how the position of the element may change.
Thus, in the following examples :
         dodobo'c                  I cut it (rep)
             gedodobo'             he cuts me (rep)
         yababxo'c                 I slap him (rep)
             geibahxo'             he slaps me (rep)
         nawewelo'c                I spread it (rep)
             wenwewelo'c           I spread them (rep)
the reduplicated element has the same form in both even and odd
numbered positions.","[12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
"  These suffixes are peculiar in that they all have a definite effect
upon the preceding element. If the preceding element happens to
be a theme element, the addition of the suffix usually obscures its
form. There are three types of suffixes.
   The first of these types includes only one suffix — that denoting
the second person object pronoun. I t is unique in that it is always
elided and is expressed b y simply lengthening the vowel of the
preceding element. When the preceding element is of the theme, it
is lengthened whether in the even or odd numbered position. Thus:        ya'dje'we'c                I see y o u
      Here -dje'- is in the third position and should have the full form —
      its length is due to the addition of the unknown element for the
      second person pronoun object.        yagwa'we'c                 I kick y o u
      In this example, -gwar- is in the second position and should have the
      reduced form. T h a t it is long indicates that the second person pronoun
      object causes the vowel of the preceding element both to remain and
      be lengthened. That the vowel belongs to the preceding element and
      not to the pronoun object can be seen by the fact that the long vowel
      is -a'- in this example and -em- in the preceding one. Other examples:
        'adnawa'we'c               I like y o u
        'adnawa'no'c               I am liking y o u
        nadje'we'c                 I bite y o u
        'ei-camxe'we'c             I break your head
        'ei-wecmaxe'we'c           I break your (plural) heads  A second class of suffixes — including those for the dual and plural
subject — simply cause the vowel of the preceding element to
remain. When the preceding element is of the theme — its form is
thereby obscured.        necgabanec'o'c             we two shut it

  The verb complex to which this suffix is attached expresses the

                           84. The Theme.
   I t will be remembered that the verb theme, though fixed and
rigid in form, was in some cases analyzable into stem and stem
affixes. Themes functioning as nouns, adjectives, and adverbs may
also be so analyzed and, in the following lists, we have arranged
these themes according to the character of their first position
elements — attempting to duplicate the verb classes defined in
sections 28—32. I t is, of course, impossible to apply the phonetic
criteria to these that were applied to the verb since these themes do
108                               HOIJEK TONKA WAnot v a r y their forms. I n spite of this drawback, it will be interesting
to note h o w m a n y of these themes fall into classes resembling those
of the verb.                                   ya- Themes.

There is, of course, no way of proving that the initial elements of
the themes listed above are of the same character as those found in
the verb themes. But the number of forms classifiable in this way is
surprisingly large taking into consideration the fact that this class
of theme comprises much less than half the number of verb themes.
   Besides the above classification it is notable that these themes
may also be classified according to their final elements.

plus vowel. This process is unique with these forms.","[117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"

"                      36. Theme Compounding.
   Another factor affecting theme structure in Tonkawa may be
found in the process of composition. The language of today is very
fertile in compounds and it may well be that a number of themes
now felt as indivisible units are old compounds, the themes of
which have lost independent status. As a matter of fact, there are
examples of such formations but, before discussing them, it will be
necessary to examine the process of composition in general (only, of
course, as it applies to verb compounds: noun and other compounds
will be handled in section 85).
   Verb plus verb is the predominant type of compound involving
verb themes. In fact, there are only three examples of other types:
hox-daxcew- morning dawns; to be morning, from hox early, before,
and daxcew- day breaks; hagoxa-adaJc-we- to be very tired, from
hagoxa- to be tired, hadak very, and -we- to be (hadak,   in all likeli-
hood, may be compounded with other themes of a character
similar to hagoxa- but there are no other examples available); and,
na-x-cogna- to scout, guide, reconnoitre, which seems to be composed
56                             HOIJEE. TONKAWAof the noun ria~x road, plus cogna- to put away, have, keep . . .
— the compounded theme means literally, then, ""to put away,
have the road"", i. e., ""to know the trail"" or ""to guide, scout"".
  I n most compounds of verb plus verb, neither theme seems to
dominate or modify the other: both appear to retain their full
meanings.
  Where this is not true, the first theme appears to be the domi-
nant one, the second modifying. The following list will illustrate
the type.
yag-xailaba-                           to shoot (arrow) into the ground
        yaq'e- to shoot (-'e- dropped in compounds); xaildba- to stick in the
             ground (tr.)
negel-nadjga-                          to kill, by drowning
        negel'e- to drown; 'ei-nadjga- to kill . . .
hawaune-daxga-                         to carry . . . here
        hawaune- to carry . . .; daxga- two persons arrive
yagau-ga'na-                           to kick . . . away
        yagaw- to kick . . . ; ga'na- to throw away
hedai'o'-he'cogyawa-                   to join in fighting
        hedai'o'- to join a group; he'cogyawa- to fight (intr.)
hengwai-cilwe-                         to wander about running
        hengwa'na- to run off; cilwe- to wander, go gere and there
hemama'go • -dana-                      several walk off weeping
        hemama'go'- several weep; dana- several go off
yac'en-nadjga-                         to be cut to death (by grass)
        yac'en- to be cut; 'ei-nadjga- to kill . . .
yamga'da-                              one person comes to call . . .
        yamga- to call . . . ; ha'da- one person comes
da'an-aidjona-                         to pull . . . up
        da'an- to grab, take . . . ; haidjona- to go up  An interesting feature of compounded themes is that the prono-
minal prefixes are placed between the two themes of the compound
(the normal position of the pronoun prefixes is the first position in
the verb; cf. 42).
          xicb -o'                     he (his sinews) are cut, broken
          nadj-xicb -o'c               I bite him cutting a sinew
               nadj- to bite
          nadj-ge-xicb -o'             he . . . me
          nadj-we-xicb -o'c            I . . . them
          nadj-geu-xicb -o'            he . . . usThis would seem to indicate t h a t the compound is not quite felt as a
complete unity but, rather, as a combination of two independent
themes.
  There are a number of locative themes most of which have no
independent usage but are found only in compound with either ha•-
one person goes (from ha-na- one person goes off) or da- two (or
more) persons go (from dana- two or more persons go off).

           da-dxilna-                     several persons go out
           da-dxilda-                     several persons come out
           ha-ixena-                      one person goes across
           ha-ixeda-                      one person comes across
           da-ixena-                      several persons go across
           da-ixeda-                      several persons come acrossOnly one of the above locatives has independent status: goxna-
several persons go in, appears to be the locative theme of ha-gxona-
one person goes in. These themes, it is evident, illustrate a special
type of compound: note, first, t h a t ha- has lost the length it had
in ha-na- one person goes off; in short, the form of the first theme of
the compound has been altered. Secondly, though these themes
may be compounded with other verbs, they retain the form
illustrated above; i. e., they do not lose the ha- or da- elements even
when compounded with other themes. Thus:
           yagex-aidjona-               to push it up (yagex- to push)
           yago-daidjona-               several fetch up water
                yago- to fetch water
           warn-adxilna-                to fall out (iva'na- to fall)
           heigew-adxilna-              several went out
                heigew- several go, march
 I n short, therefore, the ha- and da- elements — though indepen-
 dently used — have, in these compounds, become a part of a new
 verb: the combination ha- plus -gxona-, for example, is not felt as a
 compound but as a n indivisible theme.
    The two themes 'ei- and dab- are also found only in compounds.
 'ei- has been discussed in section 33. I t was seen there that it
•follows the regular behavior of a compounded theme — i. e., the
pronoun object comes between it and the theme to which it is
attached and it is dropped when the theme it modifies is compound-
ed with another. Thus, 'ei-xicb-o'c I bite his sinews, 'ei-ge-xicb-o'
he . . . me, nadj-xicb -o'c I bite him cutting a sinew (nadj- to b i t e . . . ) .
The 'ei- themes are listed in section 33.
58                            HOIJER TONKAWA  dab- appears in only one compound: dab-edjne- to lie on one's side
from hedjne- to lie down. This compound also follows the regular
pattern:
         dah-ge-edjn -o'             I lie on my side
         dab-x -edjn -o'             he falls on his side (x- with force)
         dah-ge-x -edjn -o'          I fall on my sidedab-, then, appears to mean ""to one's side, on one's side"", and may
be either an old locative theme or an adverb which has been
""frozen"" to the theme hedjne-. I t will be noticed, however, t h a t both
'ei- and dab- are less a part of the themes with which they are found
then the ha- and da- elements of the locative themes.
   The other secondary themes of this type are always found in the
second position of the compound. The complex -aye-, for example,
appears with two themes, as follows;
          yag'e-                     to shoot . . .
          •yog-ay -o'c               I pierce him (as with an arrow);
                                          pierce him by shooting (with an
                                          arrow)
          yag-ga-ay -o'               he . . . me
          yadca-                      to stab . . .
          yadac-ay   -o'c             I pierce him (as with a spear); pierce
                                           him by thrusting (with a spear)
          yadac-ga-ay-o'              he . . . me
The complex -aye- is not used alone: it appears only in compound
with these two themes. I t may be seen from the examples given that
it appears to add a connotation ""piercing . . . through"" to the
themes it modifies.
   -bel- is another such secondary theme. I t is found only with the
verb hedjne- to lie down.
          hedja-bel-                  to lie on one's abdomen, lie face down
          xe'd'ja-bel-                to fall flatNote, here, t h a t the final element -ne of the theme hedjne- has been
dropped in the compound. This, coupled with the fact t h a t the
prefix x- with force, is added to the beginning of the form and not
inserted between the two elements of the compound, makes it
appear t h a t -bel- can be construed as a final element of the type of
-ne rather than as a secondary theme.
  The theme -clo-xa- on is found with a number of themes. An.
example of its use appears below:
          co'la-                      to drip
          co'l-do'x -o'               it drops, drips on him
          co'l-ge-dox -o'             it drips on me-dola- in vain, is found with only one theme.

          da'gona-dol -o'c           I search for it in vain

          go""m-we-ix'oidj -o'c       I suck themThe meaning of this secondary theme is not very clear: it appears to
modify go-ma- to have . . . in one's mouth, so that it refers to
sucking in the sense of sucking stick candy, for example.
-yabal'a-, -ibal'a-, also found with only one theme.
          yago'n -o'c                I hit him with my fist

with one not found except in compounds. In the following two
examples, neither theme can be used independently.

tense-less as well. I t is formed by adding the subject pronouns
directly to the theme and is found only in the first person singular,
dual, and plural.

"In both of these, the behavior of the pronominal prefixes is the only
clue to the fact of their being compounds: both themes involved
have lost independent status.

         naxadj-a'da-                one person comes to visit
         naxadj-dana-                two persons go to visit
         naxadj-ic-'e'-              to indulge in sexual play with one's
                                          sweetheart
         naxadj-gan-we-              to be marriedIn the first three forms, naxadj- is compounded with ha'wi- one
person goes off, ha-da- one person comes, and dana- two persons go
off, and seemingly adds to those themes the notion of visiting or
communion with a friend. In the fourth example, naxadj- has the
noun instrumental suffix -ic (cf. 86) and is coupled with the auxiliary
-V- to be, to do (cf. 38). Literally, then, the form could be translated
""to do by means of a companion; to act as to a friend"" — this
idiomatically referring to sexual play. In the last example, naxadj-
is used with a noun suffix -gan, implying ownership and the auxi-
liary -we- to be. Thus, ""to be possessed of a companion"" is the
literal translation.
60                                 HOIJER TOÍTKAWA  nedjyaxe-, -nedjyaxe-, nedjidjyaxe- to shake out (a blanket,
clothes, etc.), and nedjlegwe-, -nedjlegwe- to wash (a blanket, clothes),
seem to have the complex element nedj- in common. I t may be that
these two verbs are old compounds but note t h a t the pronouns come
before the whole complex in each case and not between the two
elements of the theme.
           ha'nadjidjxile-                 several persons run away
           yandjidjxile-                   to run away
           yalxilna-                       to run away
           ya'ncxile-                      to run
I n these forms, all meaning practically the same thing, we notice
the element -xile- as the only complex common to all four themes.
I t may be t h a t it is an old theme referring to direction which has
become fused to these themes expressing running. There is, however,
no way of proving this analysis.
     'ei-gel'axe-, 'ei-gegeVaxe-           to smash, shatter . . .
     gai'axe-, gagai'axe-                  to out . . . off at a joint
     dol'axe-, dodol'axe-                  to shell corn
     'eibac'axe-, 'ei-babac'axe-           to break, burst . . . by pressure
     'ei-dam'axe-, 'ei-dadam'axe-          to smash . . . (glass, dishes)I n this set of themes, all have an element of the type CVC in the
first position and the complex -'axe- in the second two positions.
Notice, too, t h a t there is enough similarity in meaning to postulate
a relationship between them. I t is quite possible that - axe- refers
to breaking in a general sense and t h a t the first position elements
refine this concept to suit the particular occasion. Thus, gai- may
refer to cutting or chopping and we find it again in the theme,
 'ei-gaidje-, 'ei-gagaidje- to c h o p . . . ; c u t . . . with an axe. In the same
way, the other first position elements may serve to refine the
meaning of the general complex -'axe- though we cannot adduce
any proof of this. I n short, it is a possible hypothesis t h a t these
themes are old compounds of smaller morphologic units which once
had a greater variability.
    To conclude, then, the evidence presented in this section has
indicated t h a t the origins of some themes at least may be due to
compounds formed in an earlier period in the history of the language.
In preceding sections, other material has suggested that the theme,
though now indivisible, may have been, at one time, a combination
of elements each having certain definite functions and I think that
the indications presented in this section strengthen t h a t hypothesis
somewhat. I t is evident, however, that we shall not be able to prove
conclusively that such a process has occurred: that would require
either historical material or comparative material from languages
related to Tonkawa and both of these aids are lacking.

                          37. Theme Reduplication.
    Reduplication serves two purposes in Tonkawa: first and most
often, it indicates repetitive action, and, secondly, it may indicate
t h a t many persons are engaged in a particular action. Thus:
           hebag -o'c                  I tell, inform him
           hebahag -o'c                I inform him several times
           namaig -o'c                 I whirl it about my head
           namamaig -o'c               several whirl things about their heads
I n rare cases, reduplication serves to intensify the act as in walaha-
to boil (intr.), walalaba- to boil vigorously. Additional examples of
these functions will be found in the lists below.
    I t is evident, from the examples given in the preceding sections,
t h a t the whole theme is very rarely repeated in the reduplicated
form. Generally, only one element of the theme is repeated and,
in this section, we shall attempt to classify themes according to the
element repeated — coordinating this classification with our
earlier classification (cf. 26) of themes according to structure.                      i. Two Element Themes.
   These reduplicate very consistently in the same manner: the
first position element is repeated and has the repeated form CVCV
— this, whatever the phonetic form of the element may be. In the
following list, the reduplicated forms are to be interpreted as
repetitive forms of the verb unless otherwise stated.
dob-, -dbo-, dodobo-                    to out . . .
gob-, -gbo-, gogobo-                    to choke . . .
gom-, -gmo-, gogomo-                   to have . . . in one's mouth
djex-, -djxe-, djedjexe-               to loosen
lobaw-,        lolobaw-                to dive
ma'ga-, -maga-, mamaga-                 to cry, weep
wa'na-, -warm-, wawana-                 to fall forwards
       (Reduplicated form: several fall forwards)
co'yana-, -coyana-, cocoyana-          to swim away
       (Reduplicated form: several swim away)
co'la-, -cola-, cocola-                 (water) drips, runs
x'ene-, -x'ene-, x'ex'ene-             to sweep . . .
x'ele-, -x'ele-, x'ex'ele-             to sharpen . . .
y'odjo-, -y'odjo-, y'oy'odjo-          to pinch . . .
x'e'ba-, -x'eba-, x'ex'e'ba-           to take . . . off
c'e'da-, -c'eda-, c'ec'e'da-            to cut . . .
       Note, in the last two examples, that the repeated form preserves the
           length of the vowel.
xal'oya-, -xal'oya-, xaxaVoya-         to cut . .. off
xadjlewa-, -xadjlewa-, xaxadjlewa-     to be angry
       (Reduplicated form: to be very angry)
xeidje-, xeidje-, xexeidje-            to rub
xoVawa-, -xol'awa-, xoxoVawa-           to wash . ..
calge-, -calge-, cacalge-                to pull . . . out
62                                    HOIJER TONKAWAThere are but two exceptions to this rule — i. e., that the first
element of two element themes is repeated in the reduplicated
f o r m s : bile-,   -ble-, bilele-   t o roll, w r a p   ...   u p ; a n d hexa-,   -e~ca-,
hexaca- to point to . . . These reduplicate the second element of the
complex.                              ii. Three Element Themes.
  These vary considerably in form. A majority of them — partic-
ularly those having a simple element in the first position — repeat
the second element of the complex and the repeated element has
the form CVCY.
naboxa-, -nboxa-, naboboxa-                 to blow at . . .

        (Reduplicated f o r m : several (bulls) butt . . .)
yagel'e-, igel'e-, yagegel'e-               to jab . . . with elbow
yax'ecge-, -ix'ecge-, yax'ex'ecge-          to rub two objects together

yadjoxo-, -idjoxo-, yadjodjoxo-             to cover . . . with blanket
yalba-, -ilah-, yalalaba-                   to stand . . . upThis list, it will be noted, contains all the ne- and na- themes and
quite a few ya- themes. Just as many ya- themes, however, repeat
the ya- in the reduplicated form and it has the form yai-.
yabxa-, -ibax-, yaibax-                         to slap . . . with hand
yadca-, -idac-, yaidac-                         to stab . . .

               HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES                        63Certain three element themes repeat the second element of the
complex in the reduplicated form but differ from those in the first
list in that the repeated element has the form CVC. Note that this
list contains three ya- themes.
yaxoya-, -ixoya-, yaxoxya-                to hunt .. .
yaxwya-, -ixwoya-, yaxwoxwya-               to hunt, look for . . .

hegdawe-, -egdawe-, hegegdawe-                to sing
Finally, those three element themes having a complex element of
the type CVC in the first position repeat this element in the redu-
plicated form.
bandjale-, -bandjale-, babandjale-    to open one's mouth
doVaxe-, -doVaxe-, dodol'axe-         to shell corn
gai'axe-, -gai'axe-, gagai'axe-     to cut ... at the joint
gel'axe-, -geVaxe-, gegel'axe-       to smash, shatter .. .
gwan'oce-, -gwan'ace-, gwagwari'ace- to dig
xem'ace-, -xem'ace-, xexem'ace-     to rub . ..
                               iii. Miscellaneous.
  There are a number of four element themes which repeat the
second element (form CVC) when reduplicated.
nedx'ei'e-, -nedx'ei'e-, nedidx'ei'e-    to tan ... (a hide)
hangahd-, -angaha-, hanangdba-              (leeches) stick to . . .
hec'egena-, -ec'egena-, hec'ec'egena-    to stretch one's neck
yadmaxe-, -yadmaxe-, yadidmaxe-      to break . . .
yadxalga-, -yadxalga-, yadadxalga-   to hang ... up
yagwlaxe-, -yagwlaxe-, yagwagwlaxe- to open . . .
yaxmadje-, -yaxmadje-, yaxaxmadje- to break . . .
yacyag'e-, -yacyag'e-, yacecyag'e-   to tear, rip . . .
yalxilna-, -yalxilna-, yalalxilna- to run
Themes having nec- or hec- as the first element repeat these elements
in the form necec- or hecec, respectively, when reduplicated:
hec'ege-, hecec'ege-                       to ask for .. .
necgaba-,    nececgaba-                  to shut (door, window)
necgwide-, nececgwide-                     to tie ... up; fasten . . .
neclaxge-,   nececlaxge-                 to cough, splutter, clear one's throat
                                iv. Conclusions.
   The fact that only one element of a theme is repeated and that,
in different classes of themes, varying elements are the repeated
ones, seems to imply that elements of a certain type must be
repeated in reduplicated forms. But, it is impossible to say whether
this variation is due simply to phonetic circumstance or if it is
because of the functions of the elements. There is no evidence for
either position. It may be significant that first position elements
64                         HOIJER TONKAWAare generally repeated except when these are na-, ne-, ha-, he-, and
ya- (here again an exception must be made of ya- themes which
reduplicate the ya- element). In these last cases, the second position
element is the one repeated. However, our evidence for theme
analysis does not permit of any generalizations as to the functions
of most theme elements and, though this fact of reduplication may
be signficant, there appears to be no way of applying it to the
problem of theme structure.","[69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74]"
"Note especially the cases in which -e makes a verbal form of a noun
form; viz., yadin- e- to scrape... from yadin scraper, and bal'il-e-
to smear . . . with brains, medicine, from bal'il brains. These
alternations seem to confirm the theory that -'e serves as a verbali-
zer, activizing nominal themes. This fact cannot be proved from the
rest of the themes concerned.
   There are no conclusive test forms for the -'a element. The
contrast between yadjoxo- to cover . . . with blanket, yadjox'o- to
build a tipi, and yadjox'aw- to build a tipi, suggests that - a may
have a function similar to that of -e (-o is probably -'a colored to
-'o by vocalic harmony with the preceding vowel. The difference
between yadjox'aw- and yadjox'o- does not come out in the meanings
of the two). Since yadjoxo- means ""to cover... with a blanket"",
yadjox'o- may be translated ""to do, make a covering of blankets,
skins"", i. e., to build a tipi.
   Another alternation worthy of notice is that between gel-ne-
to be drowned and ne-gel-'e- to drown.... Here is introduced an
element -ne which appears, in this case, to characterize a neuter
theme. Only one other test form is available.
         m'e'lne-                   (light) shines, glares; (sun) is shining
         m'e-ldjidjen-,e'-          there is sheet lightning; lightning
                                         plays
The second form is obviously an old compound: mVZ- plus -djidjen-
plus -'&•-. Of these, -V- alone is definable. I t is the auxiliary verb
theme to be (cf. 38). m'e-l-djidjen can exist alone and is defined as a
noun: sheet lightning, m'e-l-, therefore, appears to be definable as a
glowing, a shining, but there is no evidence for a definition of
-djidjen. -ne appears to have the same function here as in the
preceding example.
             HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES                    51   Finally, there are a number of verb themes formed by adding a
-wa element to a noun theme. These themes seem to be of the same
type as those having -e, -a, and -ne verbifiers. The difference, of
course, lies in the fact that in most of the latter cases the noun
theme back of the verb has not been retained in active usage —
has lost its independent existence. For the themes we are about to
list, we have, in each case, the noun themes.
         acoi
         ,                          abdomen
         ' acya-wa-                 t o be pregnant         ben'ats                   spring

         daxce-wa-                 day breaks; morning comes         noxlul                    screech owl; the hoot of an owl
         noxlul-wa-                a n owl screeches, hoots         ho^o'ox                   robbers, thieves
         ho^oxa-wa-                t o steal . . .         xcr                       fat (noun)
         xa'-wa-                   to be fat, corpulent         xadj'an                   stingy
         xadjna-wa-                t o be stingy; unwilling to give         xadjoi                    gonorrhea
         xadjya-wa-                t o have gonorrhea         yo'tc                     foam (as from soap or on beer)
         yo'dj-wa-                 (water, beer) foams   The same sort of alternation between noun and verb theme may
be accomplished by adding the auxiliary verb theme -we- to a noun
theme. For example, calal tears, becomes calal-we- to be in tears, to
weep, by the addition of the auxiliary -we-. This fact leads to the
belief that -'e, -a, -ne, -na, -da and -wa exemplify old auxiliaries
which have, in the process of theme petrification, lost independent
status. Any noun theme of present day Tonkawa can be verbified
by one or other of the three auxiliaries still possessing independent
status, -V-, -ye'-, or -we- (cf. 38). We have seen that -na and -da
alternate with -e and -'a; that -ne alternates with -e and that -wa
appears to perform essentially the same function as -e and -'a.
For these reasons, it appears likely that a good many verb themes
can be explained as having been formed by the addition of a verbi-
fier to an old noun theme. These old noun themes have gone out of
existence (as nouns) probably because nouns are today formed by
adding a suffix to the verb theme (cf. 75). The themes listed below
are those which seem to agree formally with the test forms for
-e, -'a, -ne, and -wa above (the -na and -da themes have already
   4*
52                              HOIJER TONKA WAbeen given). There is no proof that they have been formed in this
way but their very numbers add weight to our interpretation.

composed of possible old noun themes plus auxiliaries. In proof of
this, there are a number of themes which, when used without
affixes, have nominal or adjectival significance and are made into
verbs by simply adding formal verb suffixes.

  This section will be devoted to the presentation of a few isolated
cases of theme alternation involving final elements. Some of these
may be of the same type as those discussed in section 34 but, since
there appears to be no way of proving them analogous, it was
thought best to handle them separately.

The above table illustrates the subjective pronoun suffixes used in
the various tenses of the declarative mode (cf. 55).
  Following are two other series of subjective pronouns used in the
potential and a certain subordinating mode (cf. 62, 66).

             Indef.         -k'aAs before, the dual is formed by -nec'- and the plural by wee'- or
-ox'-. No third person plural forms were obtained for these para-
digms.

   The forms illustrated above for the potential mode are undoubted-
ly bound up with the modal suffix to such an extent as to make it
difficult to separate the two suffixes. Considering, in the first and
second persons, -a-n'e- as the modal suffix instead of simply a
the pronouns would be -c and -i, respectively, analogous to other
pronominal forms. However, such an analysis will not suffice in the
forms for the third person and the indefinite pronoun. The indefinite
pronoun form is unique with this paradigm and even here is used
only for the passive forms (cf. 62).
   The pronouns in the subordinating paradigm are unique in that
series — the pronoun -yo- for the second person being used in no
other series unless we are to consider the final -i of -n'ei as a cognate
form.
   The subjective pronouns appearing in another of the subordinat-
ing paradigms (cf. 67) are so bound up with the modal suffixes that
it appears impossible to isolate them. This paradigm is illustrated
below with the verb theme ya-dje- to see, look at . . .","[82, 83]"

                 3       yagb-o'o-yuk         yagba'-we'e-yuk
The full forms of both suffixes appear in the third person plural
with second person object. I n all but the two third person plural
forms, the tense suffix -e has the reduced form and in the second
person singular forms, it has been elided altogether causing the
vowel preceding it to be lengthened compensatively. Note t h a t the
declarative mode suffix has the contracted form -o except when
preceded by a long vowel (cf. 17).
   This form defines a time between the immediate present and the
past: a line in time, as it were, as opposed to a point in time. For
this reason, it might just as well be termed the immediate past.
The following examples from the texts will bring out its meaning. 1

djigwo'dak yandjidjxiln-o'-ga            you ran faster
heigwidjan-ca-gen- a'lak 'eiganaxein-o'-c I lost my ring
  The continuative suffix -no may be used with this tense. I t
defines an action t h a t is going on at the moment of speaking or a t
the moment of time referred to. I n some contexts, it defines habitual
or customary activity. Thus,
heigwidjan-lak da'gona-nec-n-o'-c we two are looking for a ring

    A vocabulary of all the words used in these and the examples to follow
    will be found in the Appendix.
            HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN I N D I A N               LANGUAGES           85do'na-no'-n-o'-ga                        you are prevaricating

                              I I . The Near Future.
   Both continuative and non-continuative forms of the present
tense may be given a f u t u r e sense by inserting the suffix -a-dew-
-a-do-. Thus:
           yagb-a""dew-o'-c                   I will strike him
           yagb-a'do-n-o'-c                  I am going to strike him; will be
                                                  striking him   This tense defines a time in the near future — sometime in the
day on which the remark is made. The following text examples
illustrate its usage:
'awac-gak ya""lo""n-a""do-n-o'-c                    I am going to kill buffaloes

                              I I I . The P a s t Tense.
   The past tense of the declarative mode is formed by a suffix -'ei,
having the same position as the present tense suffix. The final -i of
the tense suffix appears only in the second person subject forms;
in all other cases, the suffix -ei has been reduced to-'e. The -o- color
of the suffix is due t o the influence of the preceding mode suffix (cf. 3).
The paradigm is as follows:
  Theme: yagba- to hit, strike
             With 3d person object                  with 2d person object
         Sg. 1      yagb-o'o""-'                    yagba""-we'e'-'
             2      yagb-o'oi-no

         Du. 1 yagba-nec'-o'o""-'
             2     yagba-nec'-o'oi-no
             3     yagba-nec'-o'o
         PI. 1 yagb-o""c'-o'o""-'
             2    yagb-o""c'-o'oi-no
             3       yagb-o'o -log                 yagba""-we'e-log
  This tense defines an action in the definite past, near or remote.
Examples:
hedobo'a'laJc ha""'ac 'eiwendjaga-nec'-o'o""-'      we two have killed many Osages
'e'da we~'icbax ya'we'd djana-nec'-o'o•-'          and one we two tied up and left
                                                       lying

  The connotation of habitual or customary activity is clearly
brought out in the continuative form of the past tense. Thus,
'egwancxaw-ca'gen-de'la      djigeu     yan-   this horse of mine is a fast runner, i. e.>
     djidjxile-n-o'o                                has always run fast in the past

                              IV. The Remote Future.
  This tense form is supplied by inserting the future tense suffix
n the paradigms for the past tense. Thus,
             harn-a'dew-o'o'-                    I will go away
             ha'n-a'do-n-o'o•-'                  I am going to go awayI t defines an action to take place some time in the future beyond
the present time — from tomorrow on to infinity. Unfortunately,
it does not occur in any of my texts — the above forms were
obtained from the informant by direct questioning. In spite of this,
the form is probably valid, and the meaning given above fits nicely
into the Tonkawa tense system.","[94, 95, 96]"
"                              62. The Potential Mode.
   This mode is formed by adding the suffix -'a-- or -'ai- to the verb
form. The suffix has the form - V - in the first and second persons,
-ai- in the third. The potential is not differentiated as to tense and
cannot be used with the continuative suffix. The paradigm is as
follows:
           ya.'dj-'a'-ri'ec                 I might see him
           ya'dj-'a'-ri'ei                  you . . .

in this exact form in no other paradigm. Another unique feature of
it is the indefinite third person pronoun that appears in the passive
form of this paradigm. The passive is formed as usual — using the
object pronoun as subject — except that an indefinite third person
form is suffixed instead of the regular third person.

"              90. The Personal and Possessive Pronouns.
   The independent personal pronoun is used only for emphasis —
normally the pronominal affixes of the verb are sufficient. Possess-
ive forms, however, are normally expressed independently and
occur after the noun possessed — between it and its formal suffixes.
The pronominal scheme is as follows:
                  Nominative          Accusative          Possessive
      Sg. 1       ca'-ya              ca'-cik             ca'-gen
          2       na'-ya              na'-yak             na'-xen
          3       'a-ye'-la           'a-ye'-lak          'a'-xen
      Du. 1       geu-ca'-ya          geu-ca'-cik             —          2       we-na'-ya           we-na'-yak              —          3       'a-we'-la           'a-we'-lak              —      PI. 1       geu-ca'-ga          geu-ca'-gak         geu-ca'-gen
          2       we-na'-ga           we-na'-gak          na-we-ne-xen
          3       'a-we'-ga           'a-we'-gak          'a-u-xenThere are, then, only three personal pronouns, w-, na-~, and 'a-.
The others are made up by adding certain elements to these forms
                HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES                          123
and, as may be seen in the above table, in a rather irregular manner.
-ya is evidently a personal suffix for the singular and dual — note,
however, that it is replaced by -ci- in the first person of the accusa-
tive and by -la in both the third person forms. The whole third
person is, however, irregular and the forms listed above are rarely
used. Note, also, the various ways in which duality and plurality are
expressed — in the first person dual by prefixing geu- which is a
verb prefix meaning "" u s "" ; in the second person dual by prefixing
we-, the pronominal prefix of plurality; and in the third person by
suffixing -we~. The plurals are similarly modified and, in addition,
take the plural case suffixes of the noun. Note, in the plural, that
the first person of the accusative becomes regular. The possessive
paradigm is no less irregular and I have no explanation for its
 complexities.
                                      Examples :

gwa'n-na'xen-la yanga'•n-o' your wife is calling y o u
ge'ge-u hegdo'n-na'xen-de'-lak give me this song of yours  The personal pronouns appear also in two other connections:
with a suffix -xwa also, too, and -djoc by oneself.
                  Sg. 1        ca'-xwa                ca' -djoc

                 91. Demonstrative Pronouns and Adverbs.
   There are four demonstrative themes, each distinguishing a
definite position with reference to the speaker. Thus, wa•- refers to
persons, places, and things which have been mentioned before:
the . . . aforementioned; de•- to persons, places, ana things in the
immediate neighborhood; he'e- or he'- to persons, places, and things
a distance away; and, we-- to persons, places, and things a greater
distance away. All vary their meanings according to whether they
are used alone (with appropriate case suffixes) or whether they
employ certain suffixes denoting place, direction or manner. There
is, then, the following configuration of forms.","[132, 133, 134]"

74                           HOIJER TONKAWAI t is probable that here the tense-modal suffix is -e-gwa, and that
the first and third person personal pronouns are, therefore, -nec
and zero. The problem is: what sort of contraction has occurred in
the second person forms where, obviously, the suffix -e-gwa plus
some unknown quantity indicating the second person pronoun has
resulted in the form -e-gen? And, further, the third person plural
form has also been contracted in an irregular manner and, in both
cases, seems to have inserted the pronoun between the theme and
the tense-modal suffix. These questions cannot be answered since
there are no analagous contractions elsewhere in the language.
   Finally, we have series used in the -Jc participial forms (cf. 74),
and in certain other subordinating paradigms (cf. 65). They are as
follows:
          Person          -k Forms       Subord.       Paradigms
            1                -ce-                  -c-
            2                -ne-                  -ne-
            3                —                     -l-  Example: Theme -yagba- to hit, strike
          Sg. 1       yagbacek              yagbacga'ak
              2       yagbanek              yagbanega'ak
              3       yagbak               yctgbalga'ak
          Du. 1       yagbanec'ecek         yagbanec'ecga'ak
          PI. 1       yagbo'c'ecek          yagbo'c'ecga'ak   The forms last illustrated for the first and second persons are
probably basic since, in these paradigms, which are tenseless and
modeless, the pronoun was protected both from the influence of
accompanying mode suffixes and the final position.
   The absence of third person pronoun subjects in so many para-
digms leads to the belief that there is no such person recognized in
Tonkawa but that the forms given are absolutive forms idiomatic-
ally used for the third person. The presence of -I- as third person
pronoun in some paradigms does not necessarily contradict this
because the -I- may well be cognate with the nominative case suffix
of the noun -la (cf. 86). With no comparative material available,
however, such generalizations, based, as they are, on the evidence
of one language, carry little weight.","[83, 84]"
"
                   33. Themes Requiring Theme Prefixes.
  Theme prefixes, as has been mentioned, are normally used freely.
A number of themes, however, cannot be used without one or
another of these prefixes: in them, the free prefix has become
            HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN            LANGUAGES                45indissolubly united to the theme which is no longer able to stand
without it. There are four classes of such themes: ya- themes (not
to be confused with the ya- themes of section 30), nec- and hec-
themes, da'- themes, and 'ei- themes.                            ya- themes.
  The prefix ya-, which generally adds causative significance to a
theme (cf. 49), is the least freely used of all the theme prefixes,
wee-, the other causative (cf. 50), seems to have replaced it and is
certainly used more freely, ya- causative themes differ from the ya-
themes of section 30 in that the causative ya- does not elide its
vowel when preceded by a single element affix and does not have a
reduplicated form (these differences in addition to the functional
difference).
           xacdew -o'                  he is alone, by himself
           ya-xacdew -o'c              I leave him alone; cause him to be alone
           ge-ya-xacdew -o'            he . . . me . . .
The above is, of course, a case in which the theme may be used
without ya-. Others of this type will be discussed in section 49.
The following lists only those themes always appearing with the ya-
causative element.
yadmaxe-, -yadmaxe-, yadidmaxe-        to break . . . (e. g., egg, melon, a
                                            fragile object)
yadxalga-, -yadxalga-, yadadxalga-     to hang . . . up
yadcane-, -yadcane-                    to think about . . .
yandjadjai'a-, -yandjadjai'a-          to meddle with . . .
yagVaxe-, -yagl'axe-                   to break . . . (e. g. his neck)
yagwlaxe-, -yagwlaxe-, yagwagwlaxe-    to open . . . ; tear . . . down
yaxmadje-, yaxmadje-, yaxexmadje-      to break . . . (e. g. stick)
yaxgoca-, -yaxgoca-                    to follow
yalmede-, -yalmede-                    to deceive . . .                        nec- and hec- themes.
  nec- is the regular causative theme prefix and may be applied to
practically any verb theme (cf. 50). The themes listed below are
those which cannot be used without nec-. I t will be noted that, in
the reduplicated forms, the prefix nec- is repeated.
necbedje-, -necbedje-, nececbecljaw-   to fill . . .
necdewe- (necdo'-), -necdewe-          to name . . . ; call . . by name
necdige-, -necdige-                    to be freezing
necgede-, -necgede-                    to count . . .
necgaha-, -necgaba-, nececgdba-        to close, fasten (a door, window,
                                            drawer)
necgwide-, -necgwide-, nececgwide-     to tie . . . ; bind . . .
necwaVe-                               to fish
necdjodo-                              to write
nececdjoca-                            to use sign language
neclaxge-, -neclaxge-, nececlaxge-     to cough, clear one's throat

is, however, purely speculative: there is no means of proving it.
There are three test forms involving t h e alternation of the elements.

                                              drawer)
            hec-gaba-                     to be knocked gasping; out of breathThe rest of t h e hec- themes follow:
hec'ege-, -hec'ege-, hecec'ege-          to ask for . . . (probably from 'ege- to
                                               give to . . .)

heclomo-, -heclomo-, hececlomo-           to cover oneself (as with a blanket)                                   da-- themes.
     The prefix da-- ""to, w i t h "" is found with only two themes:
           da'gona-, -dgona-              to look for . . .

                             'ei- themes.
  'ei- is not, properly speaking, a prefix b u t a theme which only
exists in compounds — which can no longer be used independently.
This is shown by its behavior when 'ei- themes are compounded
with others, viz:
           'ei-dil'ay -o'c                I fall on him, hurting him; press him
                                                with my body
           'ei-ge-dil'ay -o'              he .. . me
           da'an-dil'ay   -o'c            I squeeze him, hurting him
           da'an-ge-diVay -o'             he . . . me
Notice here t h a t 'ei- is dropped when the 'ei- theme (i.e., 'eidil'aye-)
is compounded with da'ane- t o pick, g r a s p . . . . Note, also, t h a t t h e

between da'an- and -dil'aye-. This treatment of the pronominal
prefixes is characteristic of compounds (cf. 36).
   Whatever the origin of 'ei-, it is obvious that it now adds only a
transitive connotation to the theme it modifies. It is found with a
good many themes, but, in most cases, is removable (cf. 36). The
themes that follow cannot be used without it, except, of course,
when compounded with other themes.

"   Some nouns and noun plus adjective compounds have the
modifier -didj like, as, suffixed. Examples:
yelan-obdjou-didj cushioned chair; yelan chair, hobdjou soft.
necwal'an-ce'nan-didj eel; necwal'an fish, ce'nan snake.
didjgan-wa'-didj Tonkawa; didjgan people; wa'- the aforementioned, the par-
       ticular
xa'cei-didj cabbage; xa'cei leaf.
necgaicanan-didj gunny s a c k ; necgaicanan yucca.
   The compounds so far illustrated — with the exception of the last
group — have all been composed of two independent themes.
Compounds built up of noun plus verb theme differ in that the last
element cannot be used alone (except, of course, with appropriate
formal suffixes).
'awac-n'a'n sausage; 'awac m e a t ; -ri'a'n-, a verb stem used in n'a'n-we- to
    be ground, mashed, and ya-n'a'n-we- to pound, mash (corn, etc.)
'egivanc-xau horse; 'egwan dog, -c, an instrumental noun suffix (cf. 86), -xau-
    to move great distances ( ?).
maclak-daxco• frost; maelak white, daxco'-, a verb theme day breaks; morning
    arrives.
daxac-haglanak W e s t ; daxac day, sun, haglanak, the -k participle of haglana-
       to go down.
daxac-haidjodak E a s t ; haidjodak, the -k participle of haidjoda- to come up,
    arise.
didjgan-yacxaw'a quail; didjgan people, yacxaw'a is evidently derived from
    the verb theme yacxaw- to frighten, scare. T h e suffix -'a may be cognate
    with the suffix -'a illustrated in section 84.
nebaxgan-bilil cigarette; nebaxgan tobacco, bilil- to wrap up, roll.
t'caxw-yabetc thread; t'caxw cloth, fabric, yabdje- to sew.
   Several compounds involve more than two themes. Some of these
are illustrated below:
'au-dan-gaxau black-tailed deer; 'au deer, dan tail, gaxau black.
H'c'a-dan-camox red-tailed minnow; 'i'c'a minnow, camox red.
dan-'ok-gabai oppossum; 'ok hair, hide, gahai none, nothing.

                86. The Formal Suffixes of the Noun.
   The noun may be followed by its adjective modifier, a demon-
strative (or possessive) pronoun, or an auxiliary verb theme. In the
first two cases and when the noun is used alone, it must also be
followed by one or more formal suffixes. These suffixes define three
concepts: 1) the definite article (-'a- for the definite, zero for the
indefinite article); 2) singular and plural (-1 for the singular, -g for
the plural); and, 3) the relation of the noun to the verb whether
nominative, accusative, dative, or instrumental. There are also
certain suffixes denoting possession between two nouns and con-
junction of two nouns. The suffixes align themselves as follows:                       Indefinite                   Definite
                   Singular     Plural         Singular      Plural
   Nominative        -la             -ga       -a--la                  -a--ga
   Accusative       -laic            -gak      -'a'-lak               -a--gale
   Dative
     (arriving)                                           -a--y'ih
     (towards)                                            -a'-w'an
   Instrumental               -ec              -'a--lac              -a--gai

   These two series are the most complete, having forms for singular
and plural, both definite and indefinite. The plural definite forms
for both cases are, however, rather rare. Text examples:
hebaixwedan-la xa'xaklakno'o a young woman arrived, it is said
ha'djcogonai-la 'awac-gak ycrlo-n-'an Coyote, killing (much) meat, . . .

ya'lo'na-k-lakno'o he'dobou-'a'-ga the Osages killed him, it is said  The definite is often interpreted as a third person possessive.

   All of the themes, when used alone, are employed with certain
noun suffixes of case. The place, direction, and manner forms may
also be used with case suffixes: more often, however, they have
adverbial function and, as such, require no case suffixes. The
following table gives only the case forms for the four themes :

Many examples illustrating this demonstrative may be found in
Chapter I I I of this paper. I t will be seen that when a person or
thing is mentioned for the first time in the text it will not have this
demonstrative but, as soon as it is mentioned again, it must employ
wa~- so that the listener will know the thing one is speaking of is one
mentioned before. Necessarly, of course, this demonstrative is
always found with the definite article since it refers to a specific
person or thing. I n the plural forms, however, the element denoting
the definite article seems to have been totally elided.

Other compounds of this sort are probably possible: there are,
however, no examples other than those above.
   Finally, there are a number of demonstratives not fitting into the
pattern given above. The most important of these is ge- which seems
to have a connotation of possession. Thus,
'a'x-ge-la hagne-k-a'we the water of (the river) has dried up 'a'x water,
     hagne- to dry up, -a'we, modal enclitic, cf. 77.
gwa'n-ge-la 'ok-'a'la hw'ac hawe'lagw that woman of his has lots of hair. In
     this example there is no possessive pronoun attached to gwa'n woman
     but because of ge- the translation is correct.
gwa'n-wenxene-ge-la naxadjganw-o' our woman is married. Here both poss-
     essive pronoun wenxene- (cf. 90) and ge- are used but note that the
     suffix -xen of the possessive pronoun is not employed.
da'he'banon-na'xen-ge-la ya'lo'na-gwa your friend has been killed. In this
     example, the complete form of the possessive pronoun and ge- both are
     used.
'en gwa'n-ge-la and my woman ?
gwa'n-la wa'dedja haglada-k-ge-lak ya'dj-abe-ga-' you did not see my woman
     who ran down to this place ? (literally; a-woman this-place my-she-ran-
     down you-did-not-see. ?)  The other demonstratives a r e :

                hega'd-gak             those

   All the interrogative pronouns are characterized by an initial
element he- and it is apparent that most of them have been formed
by prefixing he- to a demonstrative theme. For example:
                    de'l                       here
                          he-del               where ?
                    de'w'an                    in this direction
                           he-dew'an           which way, in what direction ?
                    de'dj                      in this m a n n e r

                           Associated customs
Residence: Matrilocal.
Avoidances: Strong avoidance between a man and his wife's
      father and mother; son-in-law and parent-in-law each cover
      the face in the other's presence.
        There is mild avoidance between a girl and her husband's
            HANDBOOK Or AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES                    133      father, a certain reserve being indicated; while a girl and her
      husband's mother speak freely.
 Joking: Those between whom any form of the spouse terms is used
      practise licensed familiarity; likewise those whose relationship
      to each other's spouse is equivalent, such as a man and his
     grandson. A special joking relationship is defined by the term
      tea-'xwa: The relatives whom a woman addresses by this term
     she jokes familiarly with. This was the joking relationship
     stressed by Coachina Rush.
 Levirate and Sororate: The usual sororate in which a man marries
     the wife's sister was general (during the life of the spouse as
     well as after death); the relationship was extended to include
     the wife's grandmother (almost certainly this reference was
     to the wife's mother's mother, who would call the daughter's
     daughter, and the daughter's daughter's husband, tea-'xwa —
     A. L.). The levirate is apparent from the usages of the term
     for wife.
                        Linguistic Notes (A.   L.)
   Coachina Rush used the following possessive pronouns regularly
with the terms:        ,,   ,     ,
                    sa km (ca-gen) my
                    na'xin (na-xen) your
                    a'xm (>a-xen) his
Vocatives are in a number of cases distinguished by a change of
final vowel, accompanied in some cases by a shift of accent. In some
forms, the third person was given with the addition of an initial
i-; these forms were used by Coachina Rush with the regular
pronouns as above.","[142, 143]"
"These examples, and there are many others, show clearly, I think,
that at least one of the complex elements may be regarded as a
combination of simple element and suffix — or, as a combination
of two simple elements. The combination once made, however, is
treated as a unit: i. e., CV + CV = Co• is not comparable to the
ordinary combination of two simple elements.
   This, of course, applies directly to only one type of the complex
element. No such demonstration is possible with the others. But it
is possible that other complex elements were, at one time, formed
in some such manner. As evidence that processes of this sort have
not entirely ceased functioning in the language, we may cite those
combinations of simple elements mentioned in section 8 where, it
will be remembered, the complete elision of an element was accom-
anied by the compensatory lengthening of the vowel of the element
ppreceding. Assuming, then, that such processes as are now extant
in the language may have contributed to the formation of complex
elements, we can divide the latter into two groups — those composed
of two parts and those built up of three component parts. y          ^    r These formed by the complete elision of the se-

CV-C         CV + CV + CV i ^ e s e f ° r m e d by the elision of the

C V C < C'V + CV + CV I                            third        ^CVw and CVy are, of course, special cases of the type CV~ and
serve to give weight to our speculations concerning their structure.
Elements of the type C'V, CVC, and C'VC may either be examples
          HANDBOOK O F AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES                    17
of elements further reduced from types C'V-, CV'C, and C'V'C,
respectively, or may be considered as in the same category as type
GVw.
Vr This theory cannot, however, be proved. It must be regarded
simply as a speculation based upon certain phonological processes
which may have had, at one time, a wider function. The theory,
carried to its logical conclusion, would indicate that, at one time,
the basic phonemic elements ofTonkawa were of two general types:
the simple element, and certain suffixes functioning to amplify the
meaning of the simple element. These then combined to form theme
elements of two sorts, simple and complex. With the passage of
time, these phonologic processes became inoperative: themes were
no longer formed in this manner and came to be felt as indivisible
units.","[26, 27]"
"The above themes are composed of three simple elements.
  The next group of three element themes are characterized by a
complex first position element.
ban'oxo-, -barìoxo-,                   to smell, scent tr.
bandjale-, -bandjale-, babandjale-     to open one's mouth intr.
dol'axe-, -doVaxe-, dodól'axe-         to shell corn tr.
nai'oma-,   -nai'oma-,                 to nurse, suck tr.
gai'axe-, -gai'axe-, gagai'axe-        to cut . . . at joint tr.
gwan'ace-, -gwarìace-, gwagwan'ace-    to dig intr.
xem'ace-, -xem'ace-, xexem'ace-        to rub tr.
com'axe-, -com'axe-, cocom'axe-        to skin, flay tr.
ge'cxaya-,                             to become dark
xa'bdjeda-, -xa'bdjeda-,               to build a fence tr.
xwe'ngoxo-,                            to put on pants
m'adjxane-,     -m'adjxane-,           to like, love tr.
c'edxwane-, -c'edxwane-,               to be choking
                x'obdjodjwa-           to discharge windThe first set of themes above is notable in that there appears to be
a definite distinction in function between the first theme element
and the second two. Compare, for example,
           dol-'axe-                   to shell corn
           gai-'axe-                   to cut . . . at the joint
           corn-'axe-                  to skinall having to do with cutting or breaking. Perhaps the combination
-'axe- means 'to cut, break off', and the first position elements refer
to the objects of the action, thus: dol- 'corn', gai- 'a joint', and
com- 'a skin'. We shall refer to this analysis again in sections
35 and 36.
   Finally, there are a few themes composed of two complex elements
plus a simple element.
x ac age-, -x ac age-,                 to scratch tr.
ya'lo'na-, -yalo'na-,                  to kill tr.
xa'weida-, -xa'weida-,                 to turn around intr.
bal'il'e-, -bal'iVe-                   to rub (e. g. brains on skin) tr.
xaidelxa-                              to come up (in water after a dive)
xaidibdje-, -xaidibdje-,               several fall down
yalxilna-, -yalxilna-,   yalalxilna-   to run away  These, then, are the major forms of the themes of class one — the
prefix-less themes. It may be significant that reduplicated forms
           HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES                          33rather consistently repeat only a certain one of the theme elements
— generally the first. This fact gains in importance when viewed
in the light of the tentative analysis made on the preceding page.
Here, we noted that the second part of the theme seemed to supply
the verbal connotation and the first appeared to be an incorporated
object — or, at least, a class indicator (i. e., a prefix limiting the
object of the verb to a certain class of noun). In the reduplicated
form, this ""class indicator"" was the repeated element. However,
there is no way of generalizing this tendency — the majority of
themes cannot be analyzed in this way.                              28. na- Themes
   The themes in this class all have an element na- in the first
position. It will be seen that this is a simple element (i. e., its vowel
is elided when the theme is preceded by a single element prefix)
and that these themes repeat the second element of the complex
in the reduplicated form.
nabga-, -nbag-,                    several lie down intr.
nadgo-, -ndog-,                    have an erection intr.
hangab-, -angaba-, hanangab-        (e. g. leech) is fastened to . . . ; be
                                         fastened to . . .
naxdje-, -nxadj-,                  to make a fire
naule-, -nwel-, nawewel-           to spread (e. g. blanket) out
naule-, -nwel-,                    to roast
nahoxa-, -nboxa-, naboboxa-        to blow at . . .
nadaya-, -ndaya-, hendadayaw-      to choose . . . ; pick . . . out
nahena-, -nhena-,                  to hunt . . .
nacoxa-, -ncoxa-,                  to f r y . . .
nam'ene-, -nm'ene-,                to broil . . .
nac'oga-, -nc'oga-, nac'oc'oga-    to squeeze . . .
nahacxa-, -nbacxa-, henbabacxa'yew- to play shinny
namaiga-, -nmaiga-, namamaiga-      to whirl (e. g. stick, stone) about one's
                                         head
nak'am'e-, -nk'am,e-, nak'ak'am'e- to bend . . . at a joint (e. g. to close a
                                         clasp-knife)
nac'ol'a-, -nc'ol'a-, nac'oc'oVa-   to have sores, blisters   The above list, which is exhaustive, does not give any clue to
either the meaning or function of na-. There are, however, three
examples of theme variation involving this element.
      na-bacxa-               to play shinny
      ya-bacxa-               to run into . . . ; to bump . . tr.","[42, 43]"
"
                45. Irregular Third Person Plural Forms.
  In many — perhaps the majority — of the verb themes, the third
person singular may also be used with a third person plural subject.
Thus, necexwo' he shouts, may be used in the expression, ha-'ac'ida
necexwo' many of them shout, (ha-'ac'ida many of them); ya-djeno'
            HANDBOOK OF AMERICAN INDIAN LANGUAGES                           75he looks off, lococ'ida yayadjeno' all of them looked off (note here

plays, hegegda-wo' several p l a y ; yalxilno' he runs a w a y , yalalxilno'
several run a w a y .
   Some themes, however, require a prefix he- or he•- (the reason for
the difference in length cannot be determined) a n d a suffix -wa in
such plural forms. I n addition, the themes have the reduplicated
form.

 76                            HOIJER TONKAWAIt is clear that this he- has no relationship with either the he-
reflexive or the he- theme element. In four themes, we find it
without the suffix -wa.
         y'adje-                        to vomit
         he-y'ay'adje-                  to vomit repeatedly
         rrìe'idja-                     to urinate
         he-m'em'eidja-                 to be continually urinating
          yaxa-                         to eat . . .
                                        several eat it

         lobaw-
         he-lolobaw-o'                  several dive  Here it seems to indicate long continued or durative action
though it is difficult — and dangerous — to generalize from so few
examples, -wa also appears alone in a few themes:
         hebai'a-                       to put on beads, a necklace
         hebabai'e-wa-                  to put on several necklaces
         nedjbe-                        to touch with hand, handle . . .
         nedjedjeba-wa-                 to . . . repeatedly
         doxwno-                       to smell, sniff . . .
         doxwna-wa-                    to smell something, there is a smell
                                            of something in the air
         nodo-                          to touch, press (with fingers)
         nonoda-wa-                     to . . . repeatedly
         nadje-                         to bite
         nanadje-wa-                    to bite        repeatedly (Vide p. 15)
         gwede-                        to carry . . . in arms
         gwegweda-wa-                  to . . . repeatedly  In the first of the above examples, -wa appears to be associated
with plural action; in the third example, with durative action; and,
in the rest, with repetitive action. The themes are reduplicated in
each case; so it is difficult to determine which of the processes is
responsible for the change in meaning.
  It does not appear possible, therefore, to isolate the functions of
each of these elements — nor, indeed, to determine why some themes
should require the affix he- . . . -wa, and others should not.","[84, 85, 86]"
