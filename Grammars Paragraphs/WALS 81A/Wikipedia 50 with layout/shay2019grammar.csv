"6.4     Grammatical Relations
The term ‘grammatical relations’ refers to the functional relationships between
the verb and the noun phrase(s) in the clause. Grammatical relations marked
in Pévé include subject, direct object and indirect object. Like a number of
Chadic languages of all branches, the Pévé pronoun system does not distin-
guish between the direct object and the indirect object (see chapter 6 and
elsewhere). The means of marking this distinction and other grammatical rela-
tions include linear order; the position of the noun phrase with respect to
another noun phrase; the adposition ne, derived from the verb ne ‘to give’; and
the associative preposition kə. Means of marking the relationship between a
pronoun and the verb include the form of the pronoun, which may be con-
fined to a specific grammatical relation, and the position of a pronoun with
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

relations on the verb itself or on the noun stem, and pronouns do not serve as
prefixes, infixes, or suffixes. A third-person singular inanimate object that has
been previously mentioned is usually not overtly marked in the clause, since
the role of the entity can be deduced from the nature of the verb and the roles
of other participants in the clause. If a third-person pronoun is used to refer to
a previously mentioned inanimate entity, this places the object in contrastive
focus.
   A very important and unusual characteristic of Pévé is that the coding of
grammatical relations is inseparable from the coding of tense, aspect, and
mood. Different linear orders and different pronominal forms are used in dif-
ferent tenses, aspects, and moods (see below), and in some cases the choice
of pronoun form and/or the linear order of constituents is the only means of
coding tense, aspect, or mood (see chapters 8 and 9).","[29, 30]"
"         Chapter 6: Coding Grammatical Relations         AbstractThis chapter describes the means of coding the grammatical relations of subject,
object, and indirect object in perfective and non-perfective simple sentences. Because
there is no distinction between direct object pronouns and indirect object pronouns in
Pévé, the terms ‘direct object’ and ‘indirect object’ refer here to the grammatical rela-
tions between the verb and its arguments rather than to the form of the pronoun that
represents an argument. An important feature of Pévé is that the coding of grammati-
cal relations is inseparable from the coding of tense, aspect, and mood. Different linear
orders and different pronoun forms are used in different tenses, aspects, and moods,
and in some cases the choice of pronoun form and/or the linear order of constituents
is the only means of coding tense, aspect, or mood.",[377]

         chapter 6Coding Grammatical Relations1        IntroductionThe term ‘grammatical relations’ refers here to the functional relations between
the verb and the noun phrase(s) in a clause. These relations include the sub-
ject, the object, and the indirect object, as defined in sections below. As stated
in chapter 1, in the pronoun set there is no distinction between direct object
pronouns and indirect object pronouns. The terms ‘direct object’ and ‘indirect
object’, as used in the present chapter, thus refer to the grammatical relations
between the verb and its arguments rather than to the form of the pronoun that
represents an argument. Because there is no direct vs. indirect object distinc-
tion within the pronoun system, a pronoun that may represent either a direct
object or an indirect object is referred to simply as an object pronoun, glossed
as O for ‘Object’.
    In addition to subject vs. object pronoun distinctions, the grammatical rela-
tionship between a given noun phrase and the verb can be coded by one or
more of the following means: the position of the noun phrase with respect to
the verb; the position of the noun phrase with respect to another noun phrase;
the indirect object marker ne (glossed ‘ADP’ for ‘adposition’), derived from the
verb ‘to give’; the associative preposition kə; a pronoun coding a specific gram-
matical relation; and the position of a pronoun with respect to another noun
phrase or pronoun. Pronouns are neither prefixes nor suffixes, and there is no
coding of grammatical relations on the verb itself or on the noun stem. Pévé
also has an impersonal pronoun, na, whose functions in the domains of ref-
erence and complementation resemble the functions of ‘that’, ‘it’ and certain
other forms in English. The form na and its functions are discussed in chapters
11 and 19.
    An important feature of Pévé is that the coding of grammatical relations
is inseparable from the coding of tense, aspect, and mood. Different linear
orders and different pronoun forms are used in different tenses, aspects, and
moods, and in some cases the choice of pronoun form and/or the linear order
of constituents is the only means of coding tense, aspect, or mood (see chap-
ters 8–10). With respect to the subject argument, the primary distinction is
between the indicative mood and the subjunctive mood. With respect to all
other arguments, the primary distinction is between the perfective aspect and
the subjunctive mood on the one hand and all other tenses, aspects, and moods

‘non-perfective’. The interaction of grammatical relations with other means of
coding tense, aspect, and mood is explored further in later chapters.
   This chapter describes the means of coding the grammatical relations sub-
ject, object, and indirect object in perfective and non-perfective simple sen-
tences. The interaction of grammatical relations and mood is further discussed
in chapter 9. The coding of grammatical relations in negative clauses is ad-
dressed in chapter 14, and the coding of grammatical relations in complex
sentences is addressed in chapter 19.","[118, 119, 120]"
"4.2.1       Perfective Set
A clause that is marked for perfective aspect or subjunctive mood and contains
a pronominal indirect object has two possible word orders: S V (ne) IO O and S V
O (ne) IO. The form S V O (ne) IO appears to be the more common or colloquial
form:(66) nambà gi      soko ne ni           si
     1PL    make thank ADP 2PL.O ASSERT
     ‘We thank you.’ (lit. ‘we make thanks for you’)(67) ta ɓá     só     ne nàn-a

     ‘she cleaned the house/room for me’(68) bambi        tsóɓ kavà ne mbà si

     ‘grandfather bought us a hoe’                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     3M show 1SG.O thing
     ‘he taught me something’When the main verb in the construction is the verb né ‘to give’ and the direct
object pronoun immediately follows the verb, the indirect object pronoun must
be marked by the adposition ne (S V O ne IO):(70) mum né ʒyè          ne nàn-a
     3M give peanuts ADP 1SG.O-FV
     ‘he gave me peanuts’In what appears to be a more formal construction, the indirect object pronoun
may immediately follow the verb and precede the direct object, without the
adposition ne (S V IO O). The evidence that né in the next example represents
the verb ‘give’ rather than the adposition ne is provided by high tone on the
verb, which codes the perfective aspect. The more formal version may reflect
an aversion to use of the verb né and the adposition ne in the same clause:(71) mum né nàn ʒyè
     3M give 1SG.O peanuts
     ‘he gave me peanuts’All attested examples in the subjunctive mood, as coded either by the absence
of a subject pronoun or by the use of a subject pronoun from the subjunctive
set, have the form S V O ne IO:(72) à          tsoɓ kwáti               ne nàn riʔ-i
     2M.SBJV buy food (lit. ‘thing eat’) ADP 1SG.O already-FV
     ‘you’d better buy me something to eat!’(73) à          də̀ il         mbì ne mbà riʔ-i
     2M.SBJV go scoop out water ADP 1PL.O already-FV
     ‘go fetch us some water!’If the perfective or subjunctive clause does not contain an overt direct object,
the pronominal indirect object must be marked by ne even when it occurs in
the position after the verb, resulting in the structure S V ne IO:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘I advised/told you (that) yesterday’(75) na ín ne nù

     ‘I read (it) for you’The role of the indirect object can thus be coded by the position immediately
after the verb (i.e., without ne) if and only if the clause also contains a direct
object. What all examples involving an indirect object in the perfective aspect
or the subjunctive mood have in common is this: When the marker ne is used,
it precedes the indirect object noun or pronoun, regardless of the relative order
of other constituents in the clause. The importance of this is shown in the next
section.","[135, 136, 137]"

      by a full noun; the marker PRO indicates that the order applies only if the argument is rep-
      resented by a pronoun; and the marker N/PRO indicates that the order applies whether the
      argument is a noun or a pronoun.","[139, 140]"
"   In a clause containing a subject, an object, and an indirect object, the means
of distinguishing the direct object from the indirect object depends on the
aspect and mood of the clause and on whether the argument is represented
by a noun or a pronoun. The basics are outlined in Table 11. ‘N’ represents a
noun; ‘PRO’ represents a pronoun; ‘T/A’ represents a marker of tense or aspect;
ne is an adposition whose role is confined to marking the indirect object;
and kə is the associative preposition. The nominal or pronominal status of
the subject, or even the absence of a subject, has no impact on other coding
means. Because there are no Tense/Aspect markers in any perfective/subjunc-
tive clauses, and because Tense/Aspect markers can often be omitted from
non-perfective clauses, pronoun forms and constituent order are often the only
means of coding tense and aspect.
   The following generalizations can be made about the preceding chart:
1. In the perfective clause, ne precedes the indirect object
2. In the non-perfective clause, ne follows the indirect object
3. In the perfective clause, the indirect object can be marked by position
      alone, provided it immediately follows the verb and is immediately fol-
      lowed by a nominal direct object.
4. The position between subject and verb serves as a coding means in two
      circumstances:
      (a) in the non-perfective clause with a pronominal direct object and no
            indirect object (S O V); and
                                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

             object and a nominal direct object, the order S (Tense/Aspect) IO V
             O alternates with S (Tense/Aspect) V IO ne.
As noted in earlier sections, there can be alternative constructions for the same
set of participants. The evidence that this is not a function of the choice of lex-
ical items is that a clause with the same verb and the same participants may
have different forms. For example, the perfective forms S V O ne IO, S V ne IO
O, and S (Tense/Aspect) IO V O are all attested involving the verbs ‘to sell’ and
‘to give’, with the same participants. The non-perfective forms S (Tense/Aspect)
V O IO ne and S (Tense/Aspect) IO V O are both attested with the verb ‘to sell’
and the same participants.","[140, 141]"
"6.6      Tense and Aspect
As mentioned above, a key feature of Pévé is that the coding of tense and
aspect interacts with the coding of grammatical relations. Grammatical rela-
tions in perfective clauses on the one hand, and in all other tenses and aspects
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3
the pévé language                                                                  15(‘non-perfective’) on the other hand, are coded by different pronoun forms and
different linear orders of various constituents. Although the language has mark-
ers whose function is to mark tense or aspect, these markers are often omitted,
leaving the order of constituents and/or the choice of pronouns as the only
means of coding tense or aspect.
    Pévé codes only one tense, the future tense, which is marked by the pre-
verbal marker də̀ (derived from the verb də̀ ‘go, travel’) followed by the verb
with its underlying tone. The marker də̀ occurs after the subject noun or pro-
noun and before the verb. A distinguishing feature of Pévé is that a clause
that is not marked for future tense is not marked specifically for any other
tense, resulting in the sole temporal contrast between future and non-future.
Unlike in many Chadic languages, a marker of tense may occur with a marker
of aspect in the same clause. The only examples of the co-occurrence of tense
and aspect involve the future tense and the imperfective aspect (see chap-
ter 8).
    With respect to aspect, the system can be divided into the perfective aspect,
marked by high tone on the verb stem, and all other aspects (non-perfective),
marked by underlying tone (high, mid or low) on the verb stem. Some, but not
all, non-perfective aspects are marked by preverbal markers. Non-perfective
aspects include the imperfective aspect, marked by the preverbal marker wə́;
progressive aspect, marked by the preverbal marker ké; and the unmarked
tense/aspect, coded by use of the unmarked (non-perfective) verb stem with-
out any markers of tense or aspect. The interpretation of the unmarked aspect
is determined by setting and context, temporal adverbials used in the clause,
and the mutual understanding or shared knowledge of the speaker and hearer.
    The perfective/non-perfective aspectual distinction does not pertain only to
preverbal markers and tone on the main verb. Pévé has two sets of direct/indi-
rect object pronouns, one used in the perfective aspect and the other used
in all other aspects (non-perfective). The existence of two distinct pronoun
systems allows for the coding of the perfective/non-perfective distinction with-
out any other means, such as tonal changes or dedicated aspectual markers.
Because subject pronouns do not distinguish between perfective aspect and
non-perfective aspect, the coding of aspect via the choice of pronoun can occur
only in a clause that contains at least one non-subject argument.","[30, 31]"
"         Chapter 8: Tense and Aspect         AbstractAn important feature of Pévé is that the coding of grammatical relations is insepara-
ble from the coding of tense, aspect, and mood. Different linear orders and different
pronoun forms are used in different tenses, aspects, and moods, and in some cases the
choice of pronoun form and/or the linear order of constituents is the only means of
coding tense, aspect, or mood. Pévé codes only one tense, namely the future tense.
The language codes a number of aspectual distinctions, including perfective aspect,
imperfective aspect, progressive aspect, and the unmarked tense/aspect, whose inter-
pretation depends on context. This chapter describes the grammatical means of coding
tense and aspect and the interaction of those means with the coding of grammatical
relations.",[378]

through the Pévé regions in both Cameroon and Chad according to the season.
Most Pévé people support themselves through hunting, farming, and ranch-
ing. Much hunting is conducted in the Réserve Forestiére et Animaliére de
la Bouba-Ndjida, a forest and animal preserve in the Northern province of
Cameroon, bordering on Chad. According to Wambadang, the areas of Chad
and Cameroon where Pévé is spoken can be divided into three zones: The Pévé
zone, to the north and west of the Bouba-Njida reserve and encompassing parts
of both Cameroon and Chad; the Dzəbao zone, to the south and east of the
reserve and also extending into both Cameroon and Chad; and the Herdé zone,
to the northeast of the reserve and within the borders of Chad (see section
2.3). The Pévé zone is the most populated of the three zones in Chad. Speakers
throughout the three zones have long been in contact with the unrelated lan-
guages Mundang (Niger-Congo), Fulfulde (Niger-Congo; also called Fula, Fulbe
or Fulani), and French (via Mundang). Herdé, identified by Ethnologue as a
Pévé dialect, is in Wambadang’s view a pidgin variety of Pévé, as is Dzəbao. The
other component of the pidgins is Mesmé, like Pévé a member of the Masa
branch of Chadic, which is chiefly spoken to the east of the Pévé zone (see Fis-
cher 1980). Wambadang identifies Gumadji (the name of a village in Chad, also
known as Gumaji or Goumadji) as a dialect similar to both Herdé and Dzəbao.
The village where Gumadji is spoken is close to Herdé, and Dzəbao tends to be
confused with both dialects (see further discussion below).
   Wambadang considers Pévé, Dari, and Doué to be mutually comprehensible
dialects of the same language. The differences between Dari and Pévé lie pri-
marily in tone, and even child speakers of the two dialects can understand each
other. The Dari dialect, named after the Dari village in southwestern Chad, is
spoken in the villages of Sinassi and Vaimba in North Cameroon, which neigh-
bor on the Bouba-Ndjida reserve and are not far from the village of Djibao, the
site of Sachnine’s research. The Dari village in Chad is the dwelling place of the
traditional and administrative chief of the Canton Dari, itself a member of the
sub-prefecture of Lamé. Lamé is both a town name and the name of the most
widely spoken language in the area. One point of confusion is that the town of
Lamé also happens to be the center of Pévé leadership (chefferie), whose leader
(chef superieur) lives in Lamé and speaks Pévé.
   Cooper 1984, an adaptation of Sachnine 1982, volume 2, that focuses on the
Dari dialect, shows considerable overlap between the Dari and Pévé lexicons.
The most significant difference between the two dialects is that tone in Dari
carries a variety of grammatical functions, such as future tense, imperfective
aspect, the locative function and the modifying function, while the same func-
tions in Pévé are marked by free grammatical morphemes and the relative order
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

chief difference being the functions of tone.
   A further complication in the nomenclature is that Pévé is not just the name
of a language and a tribe but is also the name of a clan within the Pévé tribe. Cer-
tain clans are excluded from the Pévé tribe even though the clan members are
speakers of Pévé. There are five major Pévé clans: daw wãy (‘children of Wãy’),
to which Wambadang belongs; daw tau (‘children of Tau’); daw kəɗa (‘children
of Kəɗa’); daw djudjoa (‘children of Djudjoa’), the family of the current grand
chief; and daw fəta (‘children of Fəta’). Jwə Lawtu, the chief of the clan daw
djudjoa, died in February 2016, and his son has since been chosen as chief. The
chiefdom cycles from one clan to the next in the order shown above, depend-
ing on the chief’s performance and the availability of a successor. If a chief is
found to be irresponsible, the chiefdom may be passed to the next clan in line.
Clan membership is handed down through the paternal line, and no woman
can serve as a chief. If a chief is deemed to be a good leader, the next chiefdom
will be handed down to his son. If the deceased chief does not have a grown
son or any son at all, the chiefdom will go to the chief’s brother. Members of
clans outside of the five listed above have no chance at being chief, but they
are allowed to perform Pévé cultural practices such as circumcision (see below)
and may also serve as courtiers to the chief. For more on the history of the Pévé
chiefdom in Lamé, see Lami 1930–1940.
   The primary cultural distinctions among Pévé and other clans, as well as
other tribes, include whether or not circumcision is required, whether or not
polygamy is allowed, and whether or not there is intermarriage between clans
and tribes. Circumcision is an important part of the Pévé culture, which holds
the belief that without circumcision a man is impure. The Pévé also practice
polygamy, with no limit to the number of wives a man may have. Tradition-
ally, the more wives a man has the more important he is, but this is starting to
change, in part because the required dowry or ‘bride price’ has risen over time.
In the old days a bride could be purchased with five or six cattle, but with the
advent of European influence and wider commerce the price is much higher
and is paid with more cattle, cash, goats, food, and beer.
   As stated above, Lamé is classified in Ethnologue as a dialect of Pévé. The
term Lamé likely has its origin in the unrelated Fulfulde language, spoken
by the nomadic Fulani people from the Middle-East and North Africa who
helped spread Islam throughout western and parts of central Africa from 900
to 1900A.D. According to oral history shared by Pévé elders and confirmed in
Abdoullaye and Eldridge 1979, the word Lamé is derived from the word laami,
the past-tense form of the Fulfulde verb laamugo ‘reign, be in the throne’. The
Fulani people are said to have used the term ɓe laami ‘they already have a chief-
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

dom to be well structured. This would explain why the capital of the Pévé area
now bears the name Lamé, though it was once called Pévé. It is said that at one
time there were only two chiefdoms in the area: the chiefdom of Pévé in Lamé
and the Fulani chiefdom of Yola, now part of the Adamawa state in Nigeria. It
is possible that other chiefdoms existed but were less structured than those of
the Pévé and Fulani peoples, and it is also possible that the notion of only two
chiefdoms was promoted by the Fulani who came from Yola along with Islam.
In the past, the Pévé people, called Lamé by the Fulani, viewed themselves as
more independent than other communities because of their well-organized
chiefdom and the practice of circumcision.
   Despite the lack of a genetic linguistic relationship, the Pévé and Mundang
peoples have many things in common, including shared clans and shared chiefs
as well as intermarriage between Pévé and Mundang (Wambadang’s wife is
Mundang). Pévé and Mundang also share some linguistic features, probably
due to centuries of language contact. These features include many lexical items
and the use of high tone on the verb as a means of coding perfective aspect.
   Pévé also shares lexical items with related Chadic languages spoken near the
Pévé region. For example, Pévé and Masa have a number of similar basic lexi-
cal items, e.g. ku ‘fire’ in Pévé vs. kuda in Masa (transcribed as kù in Melis 1999:
178); and fun ‘food, boule’ (a common type of bread in Africa) in Pévé vs. funa
‘boule’ in Masa (transcribed as fù in Melis 1999: 101). However, speakers of the
two languages are culturally distant and intermarriage is rare. In Wambadang’s
view the Pévé dialects Herdé and Dzəbao are closer to Mesmé than to Pévé.
   According to recent surveys conducted by Wambadang and colleagues, the
current number of Pévé speakers in Chad and Cameroon is 80,000 or more.
While many Pévé have crossed the border from Chad into Cameroon since
the 1980s due to the war in Chad and the development of cotton cultivation
in Cameroon, the Pévé population in both countries is thriving. The border
between Chad and Cameroon is open, and efforts by Wambadang and others to
unite Pévé speakers from both countries continue to be successful (see below).
   In oral history the name ‘Pévé’ is said to stem from the noun pé ‘valley’, pos-
sibly referring to the Marrakesh valley of Morocco, and the Pévé verb ve, which
has the meaning ‘to take, to grab’ and also the meaning ‘to convene, to get along
well’. One possible historical account is that the Pévé people were long ago
chased away from the Nile region, where the Pévé culture may have originated,
and forced to emigrate to Marrakesh, where they were taken in by the Fulani
people because the two cultures got along very well. Another account is that the
Pévé people ‘grabbed’ (vé) some of the Fulani people of Marrakesh and brought
them back to the Pévé region.","[18, 19, 20, 21]"

icate and the arguments, linear order of constituents, use of serial verb constructions,
presence or absence of other arguments, use of prepositions, and use of adjuncts. The
semantic role of the subject in a construction may be controlling or non-controlling,
affected or unaffected, while the semantic role of a direct object may be that of the
affected object or the object of perception. Semantic roles of the indirect object include
recipient, beneficiary, malefactive, addressee, and others.","[377, 378]"
"4.2.2       Non-perfective Set
In all tenses, aspects and moods other than the perfective and the subjunc-
tive, the indirect object may be coded in one of two ways: By the marker ne
following the indirect object, in the order S Tense/Aspect V (O) IO ne, or by
the position immediately before the verb, in the order S Tense/Aspect IO V O.
In the latter construction, the indirect object role is coded by preverbal posi-
tion alone. Evidence that the position of the indirect object before the verb
codes non-perfective aspect is that it does not occur in any other type of con-
struction. Indirect object pronouns in non-perfective clauses are identical with
direct object pronouns of the non-perfective set (Table 9).
   The non-perfective structures S Tense/Aspect V (O) IO ne and S Tense/
Aspect IO V (O) are attested with the verb ‘to give’ as well as with other verbs:S Tense/Aspect V O IO ne:(76) na də̀ gi tsoɓ ya nãw màn       ùm ne
     1SG FUT sell       cow 1SG.POSS 3M.O ADP

     ‘I will sell him my cow’

clause, the form without the adposition ne (S Tense/Aspect IO V O) appears
to be more formal than the construction that includes ne (S Tense/Aspect V O
IO ne). Again, this may reflect a constraint on the co-occurrence of the verb ne
‘give’ and the grammatical marker ne:S Tense/Aspect IO V O (formal):(78) mum də̀ màn ne hu ɗáw-à

ing example, the form dàn ‘word’ is part of the compound verb, not a direct
object):(82) na wə       in dàn             wũ   ne

of a subjunctive clause, direct or indirect object of a perfective or subjunc-
tive clause, and direct or indirect object of all other clauses (‘non-perfective’).
Table 10 compares the various pronoun forms. All pronouns distinguish mas-
culine and feminine gender in the second- and third-person singular forms.
A pronoun labeled as ‘Object’ can represent either the direct or the indirect
object. The presence of the initial /n/ in a number of perfective object pro-
nouns and the presence of the initial /m/ in a number of non-perfective object
pronouns suggest traces of earlier pre-pronominal markers, which may have
once served as postverbal markers.
   The noun or pronoun representing the subject always precedes the verb.
Other elements, including other arguments, may intervene between the indica-
tive subject and the verb. The subjunctive subject pronoun can be omitted with
no apparent change in meaning or function.
   In a perfective or non-perfective clause with only a subject and a nominal
direct object, the object noun immediately follows the verb. In a perfective
clause with only a subject and a pronominal object, the object pronoun fol-
lows the verb. In a non-perfective clause with only a subject and a pronominal
object, the object pronoun precedes the verb. In a clause with only a subject
and an indirect object, the indirect object noun follows the verb and is marked
by the adposition ne. The adposition precedes the indirect object in the perfec-
tive and follows the indirect object in the non-perfective.","[137, 138, 139]"
"4.1     Nominal Indirect Object
When the indirect object in a perfective or non-perfective clause is represented
by a noun rather than a pronoun, the function of the indirect object can be
marked by the adposition ne followed by the associative preposition kə. The
order of constituents is S V O ne kə IO:(62) mum ti fún ɓay mum ár                   kam rùm ne kə

     ‘he ate, but he left the rest for his son’In many cases involving a nominal indirect object, the adposition ne is omit-
ted. This is true for both perfective and non-perfective clauses (as shown in
section 4.2.2 below, the omission of ne is not limited to clauses with the verb né
‘give’):Perfective:(63) Taú né kwá kə           ndzar rum       kuni kə́dàn ti

The same sets of pronouns (perfective and non-perfeecctive) that represent
the direct object may also represent the indirect object. as stated in section
3.2, above. Because the indirect and direct object pronouns are identical, other
means must be used to distinguish the indirect object pronoun from the direct
object pronoun. These means include (a) the relative order of constituents in
the clause, and (b) the adposition ne, which can mark the indirect object but
not the direct object. Most important, when ne does occur it precedes the indi-
rect object pronoun in the perfective or subjunctive clause and follows the
indirect object pronoun in the non-perfective clause (see below).","[134, 135]"

         chapter 7Coding Semantic Relations1        IntroductionThis chapter describes various semantic relations attested in the Pévé data
base, which consists of stories related by Lazare Wambadang, recorded con-
versations between Wambadang and other Pévé speakers, French-Pévé trans-
lations elicited from Wambadang in order to test or illustrate the proposed
function of a given form, and data volunteered by Wambadang for similar pur-
poses (see chapter 1, section 4). Semantic relations between arguments and the
predicate can be inferred from the inherent properties of the predicate and the
arguments, the linear order of constituents, the use of serial verb constructions,
the presence or absence of other arguments, the use of prepositions, and the
use of adjuncts (see chapter 21).","[141, 142]"

         chapter 8Tense and Aspect1        IntroductionAs shown in chapters 5 and 6, the coding of tense and aspect in Pévé is closely
tied to the coding of grammatical relations using pronouns and nouns. While
there exist markers whose function is to code tense or aspect, these markers are
sometimes omitted. In some constructions, this leaves the order of constituents
and/or the choice of pronouns as the only means of coding tense or aspect.
   Pévé codes only one tense, the future tense, which is marked by the pre-
verbal marker də̀ followed by the verb with its underlying tone. The language
codes the following aspectual distinctions: perfective aspect, coded by high
tone on the verb; imperfective aspect, coded by the preverbal marker wə́ fol-
lowed by the verb with underlying tone; progressive aspect, coded by the pre-
verbal marker ké followed by the verb with underlying tone; and the unmarked
tense/aspect, coded by the unmarked verb stem alone, without any markers of
tense or aspect. Interestingly, tense/aspect distinctions coded in complement
clauses are limited to the perfective aspect, the unmarked aspect, and perhaps
the future tense (see chapters 8 and 19). The fact that the distinctions coded in
complement clauses differ from those coded in independent clauses supports
the notion of pragmatically dependent vs. pragmatically independent clauses
(cf. Creissels 2008, Bril 2010).
   When the tense or aspect of a clause is indicated by an independent marker,
as is the case for the future tense, the imperfective aspect, and progressive
aspect, the tense or aspect marker occurs after the subject noun or pronoun and
before the main verb (S Tense/Aspect V). In a clause in which the object or indi-
rect object also precedes the verb (see chapter 6), the tense or aspect marker
follows the subject and precedes the non-subject argument (S Tense/Aspect
O/IO V). As shown below, other material may also intervene between the sub-
ject and the tense/aspect marker and between the tense/aspect marker and the
main verb.
   Unlike in many Chadic languages, markers of tense and aspect in Pévé may
co-occur within the same clause (see section 2.2, below). Use of the acronym
‘Tense/Aspect (‘T/A’) marker’ in the current work reflects the fact that tense
and aspect markers, when they occur, precede the main verb. In rare instances
in which a tense marker and an aspect marker co-occur in the same clause,
the order of elements is S Aspect Tense Verb. The widely used acronym ‘TAM

are clause-final or clause-initial (see chapter 9).

Pévé-English Lexicon1        IntroductionThe Pévé-English lexicon in this chapter is organized according to the International
Phonetic Alphabet, with some additions and exceptions. In general, the order of vow-
els as entered in the lexicon is i, e, ə, a, o, and u; the consonant or fricative (e.g. ndz,
ʃ ) precedes the palatalized form (ndʒ, ʃy); and the non-glottalized form (b, d) precedes
the glottalized form (ɓ, ɗ ). Because some existing written works on Pévé do not use IPA
symbols, the symbols used in those works are shown in brackets after the correspond-
ing IPA symbols, such as ɓ [b’], dʒ [j, dž]. Abbreviations are used in the lexicon as they
are in the text.
    As shown in chapter 2 (Phonology), there are a number of free variations in pro-
nunciation, especially in morphemes that begin with a stop or fricative followed by a
high or mid front vowel. In the Pévé-English lexicon, the Pévé form in the left-hand col-
umn represents the native speaker’s perception of the underlying form, e.g. ʃinè ‘field’,
while the form in the right-hand column of the English-Pévé lexicon (chapter 24) may
include the underlying form and free variations as transcribed by the author, e.g. ʃinè
or sine.
    Needless to say, the two lexicons do not represent a complete list of lexical items and
morphemes in the Pévé language; there are many more to be examined and described.
The items listed below represent those attested in the data and others whose forms
and/or translations may be of interest to the reader.","[346, 347, 348]"
"3.2.1      Pronoun as Direct Object: Perfective Set
A very important distinction between the perfective set of object pronouns and
the non-perfective set has to do with how the function of direct object is coded.
As shown below, the direct object function of a pronoun from the perfective
set is marked by the position immediately after the verb in both the perfective
aspect and the subjunctive mood (SVO), while the direct object function of a
pronoun from the non-perfective set is marked by the position before the verb
(SOV; see below).
   Like subject pronouns, object pronouns convey the gender of the second-
or third-person referent and the number of the first, second-, or third-person

An object pronoun from the non-perfective set can be used to represent the
direct object in all non-perfective indicative constructions but cannot be used
in subjunctive constructions. The perfective/subjunctive object set is repeated
in Table 9 (above) for purposes of comparison.
   The existence of two sets of object pronouns distinguished by tense, aspect
and mood is relatively rare across languages. The fact that most object pro-
nouns in the perfective set in Pévé have an initial n suggests that a marker n(V)
may once have had the function of distinguishing the object in a perfective
clause from the object in a non-perfective clause. It is also possible that the
marker n(V) at one time served as a postverbal marker of perfective aspect,
resulting in the following tentative path of evolution: Verb+nV Pronoun > Verb
nV Pronoun > Verb nV+Pronoun.
   As shown in chapter 8, non-perfective tenses and aspects may be marked by
(a) use of the unmarked tone on the verb, or (b) a preverbal marker followed by
the verb with unmarked tone. When the direct object in a non-perfective and
non-subjunctive clause is marked by a pronoun, the pronoun follows the tense
or aspect marker and precedes the main verb, resulting in the order Subject
Tense/Aspect (T/A) marker Object Verb. (The term T/A is used instead of the
usual term TAM (tense/aspect/mood) because mood is not indicated by mark-
ers before, after, or attached to the verb; it is instead indicated by the choice of
pronoun forms and phrase-final particles (see chapter 9)). The means of coding
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

different from the means of coding the direct object function of a pronoun in
a perfective clause (see above), where the pronominal direct object immedi-
ately follows the verb. Recall that the nominal direct object in a clause with
only one non-subject argument immediately follows the verb, regardless of the
tense, aspect, or mood of the clause. Thus, the only situation in which the direct
object precedes the verb is the non-perfective/non-subjunctive clause that has
a pronominal object:
   Here are some examples contrasting the position of the non-perfective
object pronoun with that of the perfective object pronoun:Imperfective aspect (S T/A OV):(53) lum wə́       sə́ ti
     lion IMPF 3F.O eat

     3M FUT 3F.O buy tomorrow(-FV)
     ‘he will buy it tomorrow’In a clause that has the same arguments and the same temporal value, the direct
object in the form of a full noun follows rather than precedes the verb, resulting
in the form S T/A VO:(59) mum də̀ tsòɓ vu síw(-i)

     ‘he will buy salt tomorrow’(60) mum wə́       tsòɓ vu
     3M PRES buy salt
     ‘he is buying salt (now)’In a non-perfective clause, the marker coding future tense or imperfective
aspect is often omitted in natural discourse. If the direct object is pronomi-
nal, the use of a pronoun from the non-perfective set and the position of the
pronoun before the verb indicates that the clause is non-perfective, i.e. neither
perfective nor subjunctive. Whether the clause is interpreted as imperfective
or future depends on the context and the nature of the event:(61) ha màn yè         si
     2M 1SG.O know ASSERT
     ‘You know me.’ or ‘You will know me.’
4       Indirect ObjectIn Pévé, means of distinguishing between the function of indirect object and
the function of direct object include the relative order of constituents in the
clause and the use of the designated indirect object marker ne, derived from
the noun ne ‘give’. The form ne is glossed ‘ADP’ for ‘adposition’, as it sometimes
occurs before the noun or pronoun representing the indirect object and some-
times occurs after the noun or pronoun representing the indirect object (see
below). As shown in Améka 2003, the use of the same adposition in either
prenominal or postnominal position is very rare across languages (the exam-
ple Améka 2003 provides comes from Dutch, as described in Van Riemsdijk
1990). As shown below, the means of coding the grammatical role of the indi-
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

the presence or absence of an overt direct object.
   While the precise semantic role of the indirect object is a function of the
inherent meaning of the verb and the arguments in the clause, the indirect
object is typically less directly affected by the event than is the direct object.
The semantic roles of indirect object arguments include the recipient of a thing
given, the beneficiary of the event, the addressee of certain verbs, and a par-
ticipant who suffers from the event (‘malefactive’). The semantic roles of the
indirect object are further discussed in chapter 7.
   The following sections describe the means of marking the indirect object
role of a nominal argument, the means of marking the indirect object role of a
pronominal argument in a perfective or subjunctive clause, and the means of
marking the indirect object role of a pronominal argument in a non-perfective
clause.","[128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134]"

Focus on the subject is marked by the marker kə followed by the relative marker
mə and a resumptive pronoun coding the gender of the head. The difference
between the focus clause and the relative clause lies in the marker kə́ after the
focused subject. The source of the marker kə́ is an open question, as the form
bears similarity to both the copula kè and the associative preposition kə:(10) mum kə́ mə̀ ni tsóɓ ya nãw àmá na tsú mì

As shown in chapter 6, a previously mentioned inanimate object is usually not
overtly marked. When an object pronoun is used to refer an inanimate argu-
ment, this places the argument in focus:(14) na ti sə́/nùm        kúm-ú
     1SG ate 3F.O/3M.O yesterday-FV
     ‘I ate it yesterday’
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘I bought (it) yesterday’In some examples focus on the object is coded by the juxtaposition of an affir-
mative and a negative clause pertaining to the same event, where each clause
has a different overt object. The following sentence is a Pévé translation of the
English form ‘he bought a cow, not a goat’:(17) mum tsóɓ ya nãw (pause) mum tsú tsóɓ ya hu mí
     3M buy cow                 3M NEG buy fem. goat NEG
     ‘he bought a cow; he did not buy a female goat’3.3     Focus on the Adjunct
In the next three examples, focus on the temporal adjunct (see chapter 21) is
marked by the clause-final impersonal pronoun na, which indicates that the
adjunct is an independent equational clause (cf. chapter 11). The marker ni
codes proximity to the time of speech. The English translation is intended to
convey the meaning, though it may not reflect the order of constituents in Pévé:(18) mgbaŋ ni         na    ì           də̀ ɗe nùm ye

4       ConclusionA non-subject constituent is topicalized by fronting. The role of the topical-
ized constituent as the inanimate direct object of the comment clause is not
overtly marked within the clause. When the fronted non-subject argument is
not the direct object of the comment clause, the argument is marked by the
phrase dàn Noun DED, where DED is a deducible reference marker indicating
the gender of the head (i.e. topicalized) noun. The topicalized subject of a ver-
bal clause may be marked as the head of a relative clause, with the grammatical
role of the topicalized subject indicated by a resumptive pronoun within the
comment clause. Another means of indicating topicalization is a pause after
the topicalized constituent.
   Pévé does not distinguish between contrastive and non-contrastive focus.
Means of coding focus include the preposition kə followed by the relative
marker mə and a resumptive pronoun referring to the focused constituent;
overt marking of a constituent that is normally understood, such as the pre-
viously mentioned inanimate direct object; and the impersonal pronoun na,
which places the constituent in focus by marking it as an independent clause.","[259, 260, 261, 262]"

In Pévé, a final vowel can be added to a morpheme whose underlying form ends
in a consonant, including a glide or a glottal stop. The added final vowel, glossed
‘FV’, is usually a copy of the preceding vowel of the morpheme to which the
vowel is added. The cardinal vowels /i, e, a, o, u/ all occur as added vowels in the
data base. The added vowel occurs with grammatical and lexical items of many
kinds, including nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs, and quantifiers:(3) vay wə́       tʃiʔ-i

lowed by a glottal stop, evidence that the final glottal stop is underlying (see
chapter 2):(10) ndáʔ nə         uráʔ-a

phrase-final vowel and the lack of an added vowel. A phrase-final vowel cannot
be added to a morpheme whose underlying form (identical with the citation
form) ends in a front or back vowel, as defined in chapter 2. The adposition ne,
the pronoun nù (2M.O), the adjective kĩ,́ and the nouns lúmò ‘market’ (Fulfulde)
and bə̀kà ‘morning’ all have underlying final back or front vowels and cannot
be followed by an additional final vowel:(12) mum wə́       sə́ tsoɓ man ne-*e

The range of phrase-final vowel forms shown above suggests that the phrase-
final vowel itself does not have an underlying form. However, there is some
evidence that the phrase-final vowel has (or used to have) the underlying form
a. This is of particular interest because the word-final vowel à is part of the sys-
tem of parsing morphology in Wandala (Frajzyngier 2012), a language remotely
related to Pévé.
   As shown in chapter 2, the high central vowel ə in Pévé can be either
epenthetic or phonemic. A number of grammatical items have the underlying
form (CV)Cə (see chapter 2 for evidence that word-final ə can be found in both
underlying and citation forms):

     ‘after tonight, she will finish her work’ [Note that tám ‘today’ has no final
     vowel, despite its pre-pausal position. This provides further evidence that
     the Pévé has phrase-final vowel addition, not phrase-internal vowel dele-
     tion.]Forms ending in ə in isolation or in phrase-internal position may have a final -a
in phrase-final position, as illustrated below. There is no evidence that the final
a is underlying:(24) ta tá hayʔ bay s-á

     ‘I came back to get the horse.’Recall that the phrase-final vowel assimilates to the preceding vowel when the
underlying form of the item in phrase-final position ends in a consonant (see
chapter 2). When the item marked for phrase-final position has the underlying
form (CV)Cə, the phrase-final vowel -a replaces the underlying -ə and does not
assimilate to the preceding vowel:(26) à          kat sowã mə náyʔ        kun-a (underlying form: kunə)

     ‘I took the calabashes in order to sell them.’It remains to be explained why the word-final ə can be replaced by the phrase-
final marker a while other word-final vowels cannot (see kĩ ́‘small’, lúmò ‘market’
and others, above) cannot. It is possible that the final ə in forms such as sə́, nə,
kunə and others was originally epenthetic and evolved into the independent or
phrase-internal form after the grammaticalization of the phrase-final marker
a. It is also possible that phonological rules involving the high central ə differ
from those involving front and back vowels.","[71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76]"
"2.4      Domain de dicto vs. Domain de re
Some verbs of saying, including the simple verb ó ‘to request’ and the com-
pound verb tʃi vun ‘to ask’, may be followed by either a complement belonging to
the domain de dicto or a complement belonging the domain de re. The domain
de dicto, as defined in Frajzyngier and Jasperson 1991, consists of complements
involving direct or indirect speech, while complements in the domain de re
refer to an element of reality, such as an object or a location. The distinguishing
characteristic of the domain de re is that the complement has the grammatical
role of object in the matrix clause. The de re complement, unlike the de dicto
complement, is thus a dependent clause:                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘he asked what I ate’ (‘the thing that I ate’)The complement of the verb ó ‘to request something’ may also belong to the

of the matrix clause:(40) na ó mbì ɓá                 rum-u

     ‘I asked him for water’A requested action can be a nominalized verb that serves as the object of the

The only tense or aspect contrast attested in the complement clause is between
the perfective aspect and the unmarked aspect. The perfective aspect is marked
in the complement, as it is in the independent clause, by high tone on the verb

wə́ in the complement:(46) mláʔ       hĩ       ha tʃìʔi maandə́        nəʔ su

     ‘He told him, “If you come here, you (will) know me because my head is

omission of a tense/aspect marker or whether they represent the unmarked
aspect, whose temporal function is deduced from surrounding discourse or
the shared understanding of speaker and hearer. The context of example 50,
combined with the S O V order of constituents in the complement (bolded),
suggests that the construction results from omission of a tense/aspect marker,
in this case the future marker. Recall that the order of elements in the indepen-
dent future clause is S də̀ O V when the object is pronominal:(50) mum də̀ sə́ tsoɓ síw-i
     3M FUT 3F.O buy tomorrow-FV
     ‘he will buy it (fem.) tomorrow’The absence of overt markers of non-perfective tense or aspect in the com-
plement clause suggests that Pévé, like many Chadic languages, distinguishes
between pragmatically independent clauses and pragmatically dependent
clauses, where the two types of clauses code different sets of tense and aspect
distinctions using different sets of coding means (Frajzyngier with Shay 2002,
Frajzyngier and Johnston with Edwards 2005, Creissels 2008 and Bril 2010).","[293, 294, 295, 296]"

A question about the identity of a human participant in an event involves the
question word sa ‘who’, whose grammatical role is coded as it is in the affirma-
tive clause. The interrogative marker su occurs at the end of the clause:(14) sa dám mbraw ne nùm su

     ‘who sewed clothes for him?’Cf.(15) ta dám mbraw ne nùm su
     3F sew clothes ADP 3M.O Q

possessum, as it is in the affirmative clause:(16) hu sa víʔ su

     ‘whose goat is lost?’(17) mum wə́     bàr só        sá su

     ‘he lives at my house’A verbless clause with sa as predicate poses a question about the identity of
the human subject. The person, gender, and number of the referent are coded
by the pronominal subject:(19) ta sa su

     ‘who is she?’
                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘who was it who cooked for him?’3.2      Questions about Non-human Constituents
The question word mi ‘what’ is used in questions about non-human or inani-
mate participants and in questions about abstract constituents. The grammat-
ical function of the question word is marked by linear order or by preposition.
The subject role is marked by clause-initial position:(23) mí gí su
     what go Q
     ‘what happened?’The object role is marked by the position after the verb:(24) mum ti mí su

less clause. The subject is represented by the question word mi ‘what’ and the
predicate is a deictic demonstrative coding the person, gender, and number of
the referent (see chapter 12). The relative marker may precede the demonstra-
tive:(26) mi (mə) ni      su
     what REL PROX.M Q
     ‘what is this?’(27) mi (mə) náyʔ      su

     ‘what is that?’3.3      Questions about Reason
There are several ways of posing a question about the cause of or reason for an
event, all of which involve a preposition and the non-human question word mi
‘what’.
   The preposition zə̀ ‘for’ followed by mi ‘what’ indicates a question about
reason. The prepositional phrase, like most adjuncts, may be clause-initial or
clause-final. When zə̀ mi is clause-final, the interrogative particle su follows the
prepositional phrase:(28) mum mbə́ zə̀ mi su
     3M come for what Q
     ‘why did he come?’The prepositional phrase zə̀ mi is one of the few constituents that can precede
the subject of the sentence:(29) zə̀    mi mum mbə́ su
     PREP what 3M come Q
     ‘why did he come?’(30) zə̀ mi mum tsú tʃé           mbì mə su
     for what 3M NEG drink water NEG Q
     ‘why didn’t he drink the water?’The preposition zə̀ also marks the affirmative reason clause (cf. chapter 21):
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘Why are you crying like that?’(33) ha gí mi tám su
     2M do what today Q
     ‘what did you do today?’A question about reason may be coded by the phrase zə̀ dàn (‘for word/matter’)
followed by the question word mi. The sequence zə̀ dàn mi poses a question
about the fundamental cause or root of an event:(34) ha ʔí      nàn zə̀ dàn               mi su

4       ConclusionAll types of interrogatives in Pévé are marked by the clause-final marker su. The
polar question has the form of an affirmative clause followed by su, with gram-
matical roles and other categories marked as they are in the affirmative clause.
Content questions are marked by a set of question words that distinguish
among human referents on the one hand (sa ‘who’) and non-human, inani-
mate, or abstract constituents (mi ‘what’) on the other; manner (ma ‘how’); and
location (ka ‘where’). Further distinctions, including time, reason, and quan-
tity, are coded by prepositional phrases involving the content question words
above. The marker si occurs in a content question only when the question
expresses the speaker’s disbelief in some element of the clause. Grammatical
relations within content questions word are marked as they are in the affirma-
tive clause.","[244, 245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251]"

2        Polar QuestionsPolar questions are defined here as questions that seek the answer ‘yes’ or ‘no’. A
polar question has the form of an indicative clause marked by the phrase-final
particle su. Elicited and natural discourse examples do not show an intonation
pattern distinct from that of affirmative clauses.
  In most examples the interrogative particle has mid tone:(1) Taú tá lúmò su
    T. go market Q
    ‘did Tau go to the market?’(2) hí wé ndày só           ndày       su
    2PL saw 3PL.O house 3PL.POSS Q
    ‘did you see them at their place?’Based on natural discourse data, low tone on the interrogative particle places
emphasis on the proposition in question (the voiceless fricative /s/ is some-
times voiced in intervocalic position):

    ‘So how will you know who is who?’(6) mum sà su
    3M who Q
    ‘who is he?’ (similar to ‘who does he think he is?’)The assertive marker si before the interrogative particle places emphasis on the
unexpectedness of the event. Here the interrogative marker has mid tone:(7) Taú tá lúmò tám kə             bə̀kà     si        su
    T. go market today ASSC morning ASSERT Q
    ‘did Tau actually go to the market this morning?’ (I told him to)(8) mum tá lúmò si               su
    3M go market ASSERT Q
    ‘did he really go to the market?’ (I told him not to)The marker si cannot be used in a content question, which seeks additional
information about the event. This is evidence for the assertive function of si, as
described in chapter 9, since the speaker cannot advise the hearer to believe in
a state or event that is not fully described:(9) ha tá ka       tám (*si)            su
    2M go where today (ASSERT) Q
    ‘where did you go to today?’ (i.e. I know you went somewhere, but I don’t

tions the truth value of a single element of the proposition:Speaker 1:(10) Taú tá Garoua tám-á

     subject did not go)Cf. the neutral content question:(12) mum tá ka        tám su
     3M go where today Q
     ‘where did he go today?’The polar question marker may co-occur with a marker of modality, e.g., the
permission marker ye. This is evidence that the interrogative mood does not
belong to the same domain as the deontic and epistemic modalities described
in chapter 9:(13) á         ɬe ɗérwa ye       su

3       Content QuestionsContent questions are defined here as questions seeking additional informa-
tion about an event or state whose truth value is taken for granted. Coding
means involved in content questions include content question words, prepo-
sitions, and the clause-final interrogative particle su. The grammatical role of
the constituent in question is coded as it is in the affirmative clause, by linear
order or preposition.","[242, 243, 244]"

4       Function of Final Vowel AdditionThe function of the phrase-final added vowel in Pévé is to indicate that the
preceding morphological, lexical or grammatical unit is complete as far as the
speaker is concerned and should be interpreted as such. This can be viewed
as a subdomain within the domain of parsing morphology as described in Fra-
jzyngier 2016b, though it differs from the function of parsing morphology in
Wandala.
    In Pévé, phrase-final vowel addition is not determined by whether or not
the phrase, clause, or sentence with the final vowel is grammatically com-
plete. In the following fragment, the first instantiation of the noun dzənàk
‘guinea fowl’ has a phrase-final vowel because the phrase kəri məní, which fol-
lows dzənàk-à, is always clause-initial. In other words, whatever precedes kəri
məní must be marked as phrase-final regardless of whether or not it could
function as a grammatically correct independent utterance. To put it another
way, adding the final vowel to dzənàk indicates that the word dzənàk should
be interpreted as a component of what has gone before and not what fol-
lows.
    The second instantiation of dzənàk in the following example has no phrase-
final vowel. This can be explained by the fact that the demonstrative plural kunə
modifies dzənàk and so is part of the same unit, which may or may not be gram-
matically complete. Similarly, the final /ə/ in kunə is explained by the fact that it
is followed by the assertive marker si, which occurs only in phrase-final position
(recall that kunə becomes kun-a in phrase-final position). The phrase-internal
forms dzənàk and kunə thus tell the listener to expect more information within
                                                                       Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

expect more information within the same unit of the utterance:(33) brògò …            ʔyá táy    gi tsoɓ də̀bãwə        só

     PL ASSERT 3M found 3PL.O (error) sit under tree
     ‘Monitor Lizard went to sell tobacco in the village of the guinea fowls.
     When he got to the village of the guinea fowls, he found them sitting
     under a tree.’In the next example, the initial clause nambà gáyʔ vun ʒè nə (‘we stayed at
the riverbank’) is grammatically complete and could be used in isolation if
the form nə (/n/+epenthic vowel), which signals that the head noun refers to
a known entity, were changed to n-a. The absence of an added final vowel,
i.e., use of the form nə rather than n-a, tells the listener to expect more infor-
mation about what has gone before. While the grammatical system of the
language determines whether a given grammatical unit is grammatically com-
plete, the presence or absence of the phrase-final vowel determines whether
the hearer should expect more material in whatever grammatical construction
the speaker has chosen for conveying the information:(34) nambà gə́ və̃ ̀      ʒye ndə̀gandʒìkee …                syə́ɗáʔ har

that follows that morpheme is part of the same unit of the utterance, i.e., when
the material that follows can only be interpreted in the context of what has
gone before. In the next example, rùm (3M.POSS) has no added vowel because
the constituent that follows, namely fol-o ‘whitish’, cannot be interpreted in
the context of the material that follows. Adding a final vowel to rùm would
force the listener to view the form fol-o as the first component of the clause
that follows. The absence of a phrase-final vowel after fol would tell the lis-
tener to expect more information within the same constituent, but this would
be unfeasible since the next morpheme in the text is the preverbal (and usually
clause-initial) subject pronoun na:(36) mum láʔ i          wa rùm             fol-o           na laʔ   mbə́
     3M say COMP head 3M.POSS whitish-FV                   1SG COND come
     si      na gàk ùm zàʔ si
     COND 1SG can 3M.O find ASSERT
     ‘He said his head is whitish; if I come, I can find him.’The form fol ‘whitish’ does not require a final vowel in order to be grammatical,
since the clause wa rùm fol can be used in isolation.
   In the following example, which also involves form rùm, the phrase-final
vowel -u indicates that the phrase that precedes it is complete and that what
follows is new material. Evidence for this is that the direct-speech phrase that
follows rùm-u can stand alone:(37) a. mum gwaʔətʃí və          rùm-u        syamɗyewũ              ɗyè

completeness is provided by the following example, where two noun phrases
have the same structure but the vowel can be added only after the speaker has
finished expressing the idea:(38) handày tsóɓ ya nãw ɗáw(-*a) kə     hu ɗáw-a
     3PL     buy cow one(-*FV) ASSC goat one-FV
     ‘they bought one cow and one goat’Further evidence that absence of the phrase-internal vowel is not determined
by pre-pausal position is that a form without the added vowel can, and often
does, occur before a pause:(39) mum gé də̀wã səlay ùm…          bruk         ne nùm-u

     ‘look here, you’d better get up!’Interestingly, the lack of a phrase-final vowel where such a vowel would be
expected, e.g. at the end of an utterance that is grammatically and semanti-
cally complete, places emphasis on the final element of the constituent. This is
illustrated by the following elicited exchange:Speaker 1:(42) Taú tá lúmò tám-á
     T. go market today-FV
     ‘Tau went to the market today’
                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

5       ConclusionLexical and grammatical morphemes in Pévé show a formal alternation be-
tween the phrase-internal form, which is also the isolated form, and the phrase-
final form, which consists of the phrase-internal form with an added final
vowel. When a phrase-final constituent ends in a consonant in the isolated
form, the vowel added to the constituent in phrase-final position is a copy of
the vowel that precedes the final consonant. When the phrase-final constituent
ends in ə in the isolated form, the vowel ə is deleted in phrase-final position and
replaced by a, which may be the underlying form of the phrase-final vowel.
When the phrase-final constituent ends in a front or back vowel in the isolated
form, the underlying final vowel is retained and the phrase-final marker a can-
not be used. A morpheme that has no meaning or function unless it is followed
by additional material does not undergo phrase-final vowel addition.
   The contrast between the phrase-final form and the phrase-internal form
of a given morpheme tells the listener how to parse the utterance. When a
morpheme has an added final vowel, the morpheme is interpreted as the final
component of the constituent to which it belongs. The constituent does not
have to be grammatically complete, but it must contain all of the information
that the speaker intends to include in that constituent. When a morpheme is
in phrase-internal form, the listener expects more material within the same
constituent. If the next morpheme is also in phrase-internal form, the listener
expects still more material within the same constituent, and so on. While the
contrast between the phrase-final added vowel and the absence of an added
vowel in Pévé is not identical with the contrast between final vowel retention
and final vowel reduction/deletion in Wandala, both may be considered func-
tions within the domain of parsing morphology.","[77, 78, 79, 80, 81]"

following examples, use of the perfective aspect indicates that the event, what-
ever its duration, is completed, while use of the progressive focuses on the

function of ké may depend on surrounding discourse and/or knowledge shared
by the speaker and hearer. The following example may thus have several inter-
pretations:(62) Gwà ké        súk       wə     Mayo-Lope

     G. PROG live, stay PREP M.-L.          already-FV
     ‘Gwa used to live in Mayo-Lope’In many cases the clause marked for progressive aspect provides information
necessary for the proper understanding of the clause that follows, as in the next
example:(65) ta ké       ɓáy kum           àmá tám ta tsú ɓáy zaʔ mi
     3F PROG pretty yesterday but today 3F NEG pretty still NEG
     ‘she used to be pretty, but she isn’t pretty anymore’ (note the use of kum
     ‘yesterday’ in broad reference to the past)The progressive aspect in Pévé can be used in an independent clause whose
proper interpretation depends on the clause that preceded it in conversation.
For example, the progressive may be used in a response to a content question,
whose inherent function is to seek more information about a given situation.
The clause marked for progressive aspect provides that information:(66) na ké        in      dàn kə       rù
     1SG PROG speak word ASSC 2M.POSS
     ‘I was talking to you’ (in answer to ‘what were you doing?’)3.4      Unmarked Aspect
3.4.1      Form
The unmarked aspect is characterized by underlying tone on the verb and the
absence of a non-verbal tense or aspect marker. The unmarked aspect is found
in both independent clauses and dependent clauses:(67) na wàʔ ʔyá (ye)
     1SG want leave PERM
     ‘I want to leave’(68) na tsú bə̀ ɬew də́ mi
     1SG NEG like meat dog NEG
     ‘I don’t like dog meat’
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     3M ask 3M.POSS-FV name 3M.POSS call how Q
     ‘He asked him, “What do they call him?”’The unmarked aspect is the form used in subjunctive clauses, as marked by a
subject pronoun from the subjunctive set (see chapter 6):(70) à láʔá               fãmbə       tám-a
     ha láʔ á             faŋ mbə     tám-a
     2M say 1SG.SBJV repeat come today-FV
     ‘you said I should come here again today’(71) à          pum nùm ye
     2M.SBJV hit 3M.O PERM
     ‘hit him!’ or ‘you can hit him!’ (‘can’ is used here in the permissive sense)The imperfective aspect marker wə́ can be optional in a clause referring to an
unbounded event. Since the verb following the imperfective marker has its
underlying tone, deleting wə́ results in a clause in the unmarked tense/aspect,
raising the question of whether there really is an unmarked tense/aspect:(72) May (wə́) ɗi fún ɓay Gwà (wə́) gi tsoɓ rum              lúmò
     M. IMPF cook food CONJ G. IMPF sell             3M.POSS market
     ‘May cooks food and Gwa sells it at the market’The evidence that there is an unmarked aspectual form that is distinct from the
imperfective or any other aspect is provided by the fact that there are indica-
tive clauses in which neither the perfective high tone nor an overt tense/aspect
marker, including wə́, can be used. This is true of the subjunctive clause below:(73) mum *wə́/*də̀     gewa mbə̀ sədayʔ         dáyʔ
     3M IMPF/FUT return come day after tomorrow day after
     for ‘he should come back in three days’In the following example, the verb ɗə is not marked for tense or aspect and can
occur only in its underlying form. Reference to the future is provided solely by
the temporal adverbial siw:(74) à          ɗə/*ɗə́ nan siw-i
     2M.SBJV call       1SG.O tomorrow-FV
     ‘call me tomorrow’                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3
tense and aspect                                                               153  Similarly with the verb mbə̀ ‘come’, which retains its underlying low tone
even in reference to the future:(75) Taú láʔ mum mbə̀ siw-i
     T. say 3M come tomorrow-FV
     ‘Tau said he will come tomorrow’In the main clause of the following example neither wə́ (IMPF) or də̀ (FUT)
can be used before the verb ‘to say’. The use of the non-perfective pronoun ùm
to indicate the addressee rules out the perfective interpretation, leaving the
unmarked aspect as the only possible meaning:(76) lum gwàʔ *wə́/*də̀       ùm in ne na      à   kar riʔ
     lion then IMPF/FUT 3M.O say ADP I.PRO 2M.SBJV look already
     mbə̀ tí          rìʔi
     come PROX.F already
     for ‘Lion then says to him, “Look here!”’Compare with the perfective form, where the addressee is marked by nùm, not
ùm, and the adposition ne precedes the addressee. The future marker is omit-
ted in the complement clause, leaving only the choice of pronoun (màn, the
non-perfective 1SG object) and the constituent order SOV as markers of the
non-perfective aspect:(77) mum lɛ́ʔ né nəm ha lambə                   sí       ha man yè
     mum láʔ ne nùm ha láʔ              mbə̀ si          ha màn yè

     si
     ASSERT
     ‘He told him, “If you come here, you will know me.” ’3.4.2       Function
The interpretation of the unmarked aspect depends on context. When there
is no adverbial or other marker indicating the temporal structure of the event,
the unmarked aspect may be interpreted as pertaining to the time of speech,
as is the case with the form waʔ ‘want’ in the following:
                                                                  Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     REL           last time pass I.PRO
     ‘I want to tell the story about my most recent trip from Maroua to Garoua
     last Friday.’The unmarked aspect may also indicate a habitual or unbounded event. Use of
a temporal adverbial may narrow the scope of the unmarked aspect:(79) tá gi tsoɓ súm ( fə̀tà lúmò)
     3F sell      beer day market
     ‘she sells beer (on the day of the market)’The unmarked aspect may describe an unbounded state that obtains at the
time of speech:(80) Gwà toŋ pã          May si
     G. large exceed M. ASSERT
     ‘Gwa is bigger than May’The unmarked aspect may also describe an unbounded state that obtained
prior to the time of speech:(81) motaʔ         ɗáw tsugàk          tsùwal mi
     mòtaʔ (borr.) ɗáw tsú         gàk tsùwal mi
     car (Ful.)    one NEG can cross NEG
     ‘Not one car could cross it.’ (before the time of speech)The constituent order in the unmarked tense/aspect is the same as that of a
clause in any other non-perfective aspect (see chapter 6). In the next example,
the order S V O IO ne, along with the choice of pronoun from the non-perfective
set, makes it clear that the clause is non-perfective, even though there is no
overt tense/aspect marker:
                                                                  Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     for ‘he never buys mine’In the subjunctive clause the unmarked aspect may refer to a bounded event

the clause as subjunctive):(87) ì        mbə̀ ni         riʔ-i

marker də̀; the perfective aspect, marked by relative high tone on the verb;
the imperfective aspect, marked by the preverbal marker wə́; the progressive
aspect, marked by the preverbal marker ké; and the unmarked aspect, charac-
terized by underlying tone on the verb and the absence of any other external
markers. Only the unmarked aspect is attested in the subjunctive clause.
   The perfective aspect describes a singulative event that was or will be com-
pleted, while the imperfective describes a state or event ongoing at the time of
speech or some other specified time. The progressive aspect marks a clause as
essential to understanding the material that follows the marked clause or as a
response to a preceding question. The interpretation of the unmarked aspect
depends on context and the nature of the event. In the indicative clause, the
unmarked aspect may refer to ongoing, repeated, habitual or unbounded event;
in the subjunctive clause, the unmarked aspect may also refer to a bounded or
singulative event.","[164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172]"
"2.6     Mood in the Complement Clause
The subjunctive mood in the complement is coded by the use of a subject pro-
noun from the subjunctive set. This holds true for direct- and indirect-speech
complements:(51) mə̀m láʔá            fãmbə tám kədàn vɛ            səle   màn-a

     lion say 2M.SBJV 2M.SBJV repeat PERM
     ‘Lion said, “Go back!”’The subjunctive subject marker is used even if the nature of the matrix clause
indicates obligation or command, as in the following example:(53) tá ták nùm í            nə̀       tsòɓ mbə̀ràw né sə́ mì
     3F forbid 3M.O COMP 3M.SBJV buy clothing ADP 3F.O NEG
     ‘she forbade him from buying her clothing’The subject is marked in the subjunctive complement even if the subject is also
overtly marked as the addressee in the main clause:(54) handày ín ne mbà mə́                  ʔyá só  sí
     3PL      say ADP 1PL.O 1PL.SBJV leave village ASSERT
     ‘they told us we should leave the village’(55) ə̀ŋ        làʔ sə́ tə̀         mbə̀ ye
     2F.SBJV say 3F.O 3F.SBJV come PERM
     ‘tell her to come!’ (‘(you) tell her1 she1 should come’)2.7     Speech Topic as Complement
The complement of a verb of saying may represent the thing said or the topic
of speech. The noun dàn ‘word’ after the verb in refers to a fragment of speech,
which may or may not be specific:(56) na ín dàn ne nù
     1SG tell word ADP 2M.O
     ‘I told you something/I told you that’(57) na ké        in dàn kə        rù
     1SG PROG tell word ASSC 2M.POSS
     ‘I was saying something/that to you’The phrase wa dàn ‘about’ (lit. ‘on word’) marks what follows as the topic of
speech:
                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     1SG want PURP tell         about trip
     ‘I would like to talk about the trip.’The form wa, corresponding to ‘about’, may occur without the noun dàn ‘word’

duced only complements in the form of independent clauses, preceded by the
complementizer i:(61) handày ín né nàn í                  á         ʔyá yé

3       Verbs of PerceptionComplements of matrix verbs of perception distinguish between direct and
indirect perception. The recorded verbs of perception include mùn ‘to hear, to
understand’, we ‘to see, to know, to recognize’, and ye, a dialectal variant of we.
   Indirect perception is coded by the complementizer i followed by an inde-
pendent clause. Since there is no addressee, the complementizer i follows the
matrix-clause verb:
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘Tau heard that she1,2 forgot her1,2 hoes’The complementizer i may be preceded by the phrase handày ín ‘they said’,
where the 3PL subject pronoun represents an unspecified speaker:(65) Taú mún handày ín i              tá ɗúm wa kávà s-á
     T. hear 3PL         say COMP 3F forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
     ‘Tau heard that she1 forgot her1 hoe’ (‘Tau heard them/someone say that
     she forgot her hoe’)Direct perception is coded by the object role of the complement clause in the
matrix clause, the same means used to code the de re domain with the verb tʃi
vun ‘to ask’. The complementizer i does not occur:(66) na wé swə wə́        mbə̀ hayʔ mbà
     1SG saw man IMPF enter PREP 1PL.POSS
     ‘I saw someone entering our place’Evidence that the complement is the object of the matrix clause is provided by
the fact that the pronominal subject of the complement clause is represented
by an object pronoun:(67) na wé sə́ ʔyá       wə́  dà
     1SG see 3F.O depart IMPF go
     ‘I saw her leaving’The subject of the complement clause may be represented as the possessor of

     1SG hear foot walk 3M.POSS IMPF come

     M. heard word 1SG.POSS ASSERT
     ‘May heard/understood what I said’ (‘heard my words’)
4       Verbs of CognitionVerbs of cognition include we or ye ‘to recognize, to know’ (also ‘to see’, above),
ɗìk ‘to think, to believe’, and ɗúm wa ‘to forget’ (‘to lose head’). Complements of
these verbs code a distinction between indirect knowledge and direct knowl-
edge. The latter is marked by the complement serving as the object of the
matrix clause.
   The complement representing indirect knowledge is an independent clause
preceded by the complementizer i:(70) mum wə́        ɗìk      i        mum gáo
     3M IMPF believe COMP 3M hunter
     ‘he1 believes that he1,2 is a hunter’(71) mum ɗík        i         mum gáo
     3M believe COMP 3M hunter
     ‘he1 believed that he1,2 was a hunter’In constructions involving the verb we as a cognitive verb, the matrix clause
is followed by the assertive marker sí, possibly to distinguish we as a cognitive
verb from we as a verb of perception:(72) na wé      si        hə́ŋ ɗúm wa kávà màŋ-á
     1SG know ASSERT 2F forget hoe 2F.POSS-FV

domain de re, indicated by the fact that the nominalized verb of the comple-
ment functions as the object of the main clause:(75) swə̀ nyé           ʒi gayʔ      si
     swə nə       yé    ʒi gayʔ      si
     man DED.M know play game-FV ASSERT
     ‘the man knew how to play gayʔ’In the next example the compound verb ɮaʔ wa dàn (ɮáʔ+‘about’) corresponds
to ‘to realize’. It is possible that ɮaʔ and zaʔ ‘to find’ are derived from the same
source. In the next example, the event of the de re complement is represented
by a nominalized compound verb (ɗúm wa) that functions as the object of
the main clause. The agent of the complement clause, which may have its
own object, is indicated by a possessive pronoun modifying the nominalized
verb:(76) sə̀ráy ɮáʔ     wa dàn ɗúm wa kávà s-á
     S.     realize about forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
     ‘Səray realized that she forgot her hoe’ (‘she realized the forgetting of her
     hoe’)The complement of the compound verb ɗúm wa is marked for the domain de
re when the thing forgotten is an entity or place. The complement is a relative
clause whose head (bolded) is the item whose identity is in question. The rela-

5       Volitional Verb wàʔComplements of the verb wàʔ ‘to want’ distinguish between the domains
de dicto and de re, where the different-subject complement belongs to the
domain de dicto and the same-subject complement belongs to the domain de
re.
    The different-subject complement is an independent clause preceded by the
complementizer i. The use of a subject pronoun, not an object pronoun, to code
the subject of the complement is evidence that the subject of the complement
does not play a grammatical role in the main clause:(80) tá wə́    wàʔ i         handày ʔyá yé
     3F IMPF want COMP 3PL.O leave PERM
     ‘she wants them to leave’(81) handày wàʔ i            nambà ʔyá yé
     3PL     want COMP 1PL.O leave PERM
     ‘they want us to leave’An interesting feature of different-subject complements of the verb wàʔ is that
the 1PL or 3PL subject of the complement clause is marked by a pronoun from
the indicative/alienable possession set (see above), while all other subject pro-
nouns used in different-subject complements are from the subjunctive set. The
complementizer i occurs with both types of complements, indicative and sub-
junctive:(82) ha wàʔ i         á         gi mi su
     2M want COMP 1SG.SBJV do what Q
     ‘what do you want me to do?’(83) na wàʔ i            à         tsar gaɓ vay màn

     1PL    want COMP 2PL.SBJV leave
     ‘we want you to leave’The distribution of indicative vs. subjunctive pronouns in the complement
holds true in all aspects and also with the counterfactual marker kə̀zə́:Subjunctive subject:(85) nambà wàʔ í           à  ʔyá
     1PL    want COMP 2M.SBJV leave
     ‘we wanted you to leave’(86) mum wáʔ í          kə̀zə́ á mbà

     3PL     want CF COMP 1PL        leave PERM
     ‘they wanted us to leave’The same-subject complement of the verb wàʔ has no subject marker. The verb
of the complement functions as the object of the matrix clause, marking the
clause as belonging to the domain de re. The complement may be followed by
the permission marker ye, which codes the subjunctive mood:(88) tá wàʔ ʔyá (ye)
     3F want leave PERM
     ‘she wants to leave’(89) handày wàʔ ʔyá (ye)
     3PL     want leave PERM
     ‘they want to leave’The matrix verb wàʔ may be followed by the purpose marker kə́dàn, which also
codes purpose in non-volitional constructions. The only recorded instances
involve a same-subject complement without an overt subject marker, where
the subject of the complement is the object of the matrix clause:

     ‘if you want to eat, ask him for food’
6       Ability Verb gàk ‘Can, Be Able’The speaker’s estimation of the ability of the subject to perform an action is
coded by the verb gàk ‘to be able’ followed by a verb denoting the action. The
same form with the same meaning is found in Mundang. The verb gàk resem-
bles the future tense marker də̀ and the aspect marker wə́ and ké in that gàk
follows the subject and precedes the verb; the verb following gàk is in the
unmarked form; and other markers, including pronouns referring to the indi-
rect object, may intervene between gàk and the main verb. The verb gàk thus
functions as an auxiliary rather than a matrix verb:(92) mum làʔ         gé ndoʔ sin um             si mum gàk pemãy
     3M COND finish work 3M.POSS ASSERT 3M can rest
     si
     ASSERT
     ‘if he has finished his work, he can rest’When the verbal complement describing the action to be performed has a
pronominal direct object, the order of elements is S gàk O V and the pronoun
representing the object is from the non-perfective set:(93) na làʔ        mbə́ síi          na gàʔ əm zaʔ si

     ‘If I came here, I could find him.’Cf. the future-tense clause, where the object pronoun also occurs between
tense marker and verb:

     3F FUT 3M.O hit-FV
     ‘she will hit him’High tone on the verb gàk in the indicative clause indicates that the poten-
tial action was achieved. The verb following gák (gàk with high tone) is in the
unmarked form and the object pronoun is from the perfective set:(95) na gák zaʔ nùm si
     1SG can find 3M.O ASSERT
     ‘I was able to find him’Although the construction involving gàk resembles constructions involving
tense and aspect markers, there are several important differences. One is the
fact that the verb gàk may carry the high tone coding perfective aspect, while
tense/aspect markers have fixed tone. Another is that gàk may function as a
main verb, as evidenced by the following complete clause:(96) na tsú gák mì
     1SG NEG can NEG
     ‘I was not able to/I could not’The speaker’s estimation of the subject’s ability can also be coded by a serial
verb construction consisting of the verb záʔ ‘to find’ followed by another verb:(97) ɓay mota          mə̀nahã                    rawtirùm

marker kə̀zə́, glossed ‘CF’ for ‘counterfactual’, as a means of indicating that
the subject’s belief or wish, as expressed in the matrix clause, was unreal-
ized.
   The precise function of kə̀zə́ depends on the choice of verb in the matrix
clause. With a verb of cognition, kə̀zə́ indicates that the belief of the matrix-
clause subject did not turn out to be true. The marker kə̀zə́ follows the matrix
verb. The evidence that kə̀zə́ is part of the matrix clause and not the comple-
ment is that kə̀zə́ can be followed by the complementizer i.(98) sə̀ráy ɗík      kə̀zə́ i      tá ɗúm wa kávà s-á
     S.     believe CF COMP 3F forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
     ‘S. thought that she forgot her hoe’ (she didn’t forget it)Cf. the clause with the compound verb ɮáʔ wa dàn ‘realize’, where the subject’s
belief is borne out by events. Here, kə̀zə́ does not occur:(99) sə̀ráy ɮáʔ wa dàn ɗúm wa kávà s-á
     S.      realize     forget hoe 3F.POSS-FV
     ‘S. realized that she forgot her hoe’When it is not obvious whether the subject’s belief holds true or not, kə̀zə́ is not
used:(100) mum ɗík         i        mum gáo
      3M believe COMP 3M hunter
      ‘he1 believed that he (1,2) was a hunter’ (he may or may not be a hunter)Use of kə̀zə́ with the volitional matrix verb wàʔ ‘want’ indicates that the sub-
ject’s desire was not met:(101) handày wáʔ kə̀zə́ í          nambà ʔyá yé
      3PL     want CF COMP 1PL              leave PERM
      ‘they wanted us to leave’ (we didn’t leave)Without kə̀zə́, the subject’s desire may or may not have been met:
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

      ‘we wanted you to leave’ (he may or may not have left)As previously noted, the same-subject complement of the verb wàʔ functions
as the object of the matrix clause (domain de re). Evidence for the object role
of the nominalized verb is that it precedes the counterfactual marker:(103) nambà wàʔ ʔyá kə̀zə́ yé
      1PL    want leave CF PERM
      ‘we wanted to leave’ (but we couldn’t)Cf. without the counterfactual marker:(104) handày wàʔ yá yé
      3PL     want leave PERM
      ‘they want to leave’In a sentence involving the auxiliary verb gàk ‘to be able’ there is no matrix
clause. The marker kə̀zə́, which indicates that the act the speaker deemed pos-
sible did not occur, is attested in both clause-final and clause-initial position, a
characteristic of most adjuncts (see chapter 23):(105) na gàk ùm zàʔ kə̀zə́ si

      CF 1SG can 3M.O find ASSERT
      ‘I should have been able to find him’The evidence for the counterfactual function of kə̀zə́ is that the counterfac-
tual matrix clause can be followed by a clause negating the potential event
described by the matrix clause:(107) na gàk ùm zàʔ kə̀zə́ si              àmá na tsú gák mì

took place:(108) na gàk ùm zàʔ kə̀zə́ si               *ɓay na záʔ nùm si

sis clause, where it indicates that the condition described by the protasis was
not met.","[296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306, 307, 308]"

2        TopicalizationIn Pévé, as in many subject-initial languages, a constituent or phrase that is not
the subject of the clause may be topicalized by being placed at the beginning
of the clause. The grammatical role of the topicalized constituent may or may
not be overtly marked in the comment clause.
   When the topicalized constituent refers to an inanimate entity that func-
tions as the direct object in the comment clause, its role in the comment clause
is not overtly marked. This is consistent with the absence of overt coding of the
inanimate direct object in other constructions (see chapters 6 and 12):(1) ã … eh, sém mi           dʔe má su

    ‘Um, what is your name?’ (lit. ‘name, you (pl.) call (it) how?’)© koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2020 | doi:10.1163/9789004410053_016   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

    meat dog           1SG NEG like NEG
    ‘dog meat, I don’t like (it)’The function of a fronted direct object whose grammatical role in the comment
clause is overtly marked is described in section 3.2, below.
   When the fronted argument plays a role other than direct object in the com-
ment clause, the topicalized entity is marked by the phrase dàn Noun DED,
where dàn has the meaning ‘word, topic’, ‘Noun’ represents the topicalized
argument, and the determiner is from the deducible reference set rə and nə (see
chapter 12). Note that the topicalized entities below function as possessors, not
direct objects, in the comment clause:(3) làʔ        dàn ndáʔ nə          si          Taú də̀ gi tsoɓ rum-u
    COND word horse DED.M ASSERT T. FUT sell                         3M.POSS-FV
    ‘if it’s about the horse, Tau will do his sale’ (i.e., sell him)(4) làʔ        dàn ya nãw rə          si        Taú də̀ gi tsoɓ s-á
    COND word cow            DED.F ASSERT T. FUT sell              3F.POSS-FV
    ‘if it’s about the cow, Tau will do her sale’ (i.e., sell her)When the topicalized element is a locative complement its role in the comment
clause is marked by the demonstrative han (see chapter 12), which is used only
in anaphoric reference to a location:(5) Mora (pause) na tá han sem ráw-a
    M.             1SG go there times many-FV
    ‘Mora, I have been there many times’Because the subject is the first constituent in the neutral clause (i.e. a clause
without a topicalized constituent), fronting is not a sufficient means for topi-
calizing the subject. The topicalized subject has the form of a headless relative
clause, where the topicalized subject is preceded by the relative marker mə and
followed by the deducible reference marker nə or rə (see chapter 17 for the func-
tion of nə or rə as postrelative marker). The grammatical role of the topicalized
subject constituent is indicated by a resumptive pronoun within the comment
clause:
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

the topicalized constituent:(7) mə Taú (pause) mum tá lúmò tám kə          bə̀kà   si
    REL T.             3M go market today ASSC morning ASSERT
    ‘as for Tau, he went to the market today’In the following elicited verbless clause there is no marker either before or after
the topicalized subject. The only indication of topicalization is the pause after
the topicalized constituent Gwà and the indicative subject pronoun tá in the
comment clause. The clause-final impersonal pronoun na marks the verbless
equational clause (see chapter 11):(8) Gwà, tá ndzar-rín           mə̀ mbə̀rí na
    G.    3F sister-1SG.POSS REL older I.PRO

    ‘Gwà is my older sister’
3       FocusA variety of constituents can be placed in focus, including nouns, modifiers,
and predicates. The chief formal difference between topicalization and focus is
that the focused element is not fronted but remains in situ, where its grammati-
cal role is marked by the same means used in the neutral clause. Recall that Pévé
does not draw a formal distinction between contrastive and non-contrastive
focus.","[257, 258, 259]"

Wambadang, collaborator of the present work and a long-time resident of
northern Cameroon. Wambadang was born in 1968 and raised in the Pévé vil-
lage of Bad dis Sem (also called Badissem or Bad es Sem), Cameroon, just
west of the border between Cameroon and Chad. The village was named after
Wambadang’s grandfather, who lived in the area long before the borderline
between Chad and Cameroon was established in 1960. Wambadang’s father
ensured that his children grew up speaking Pévé as their native language, an
approach that Wambadang has adopted with his own children. Wambadang
has a bachelor’s degree and three years of study at l’ École Normale Superieure,
with the ranking of Professeur des Lycées Option Langue Allemande. In addi-
tion to Pévé, Wambadang speaks French, English, German, Mundang, and Ful-
fulde.
    The data base used in the present work consists of natural discourse data
in the form of stories related by Lazare Wambadang; recorded conversations
between Wambadang and other Pévé speakers; elicited data consisting of trans-
lations of phrases or sentences from French into Pévé; and volunteered data,
i.e., sentences and phrases provided by Wambadang in order to test or illus-
trate the proposed function of a given lexical or syntactic form.","[24, 25]"

the present work, the modifier məsín is glossed as ‘other’ for simplicity:(78) mum tsóɓ ya nãw swə məsín ɓá            Taú

solely by position with respect to the verb (see chapter 6, above). As is the case
with the subject, there is no dedicated formal means of coding the semantic
relationship of the object. However, one can generalize that in a clause with
both a subject and a direct object, the direct object is more affected and/or less
controlling than the subject:(20) mòta        nyén dapa gaʔ ti           ɓáyrúm

object is more affected and/or less controlling than either of the two other
arguments. There is no marker indicating the specific nature, i.e. affecting
vs. controlling, of the semantic relationship between the verb and the direct
object:(22) na də̀ ne hu kə              ndzə̀r rin-i

4       Semantic Role of the Indirect ObjectIn a clause with two non-subject arguments, the indirect object argument
refers to a participant that is indirectly affected by the event or that is less
affected/controlled by the event than is the direct object. As shown in chap-
ter 6, the indirect object role of a noun can be marked by linear order alone
provided the clause also contains a direct object. In a clause without a direct
object, the indirect object must be marked by the adposition ne.","[144, 145, 146]"

Direct and indirect object pronouns used in a subjunctive clause are from the
perfective object pronoun set (see section 1, above, and also chapter 6):(14) à          pum nùm ye
     2M.SBJV hit 3M.O PERM
     ‘hit him!’(15) à         ne nàn riʔ-i

     ‘you should/may give it to me’ (request, permission)Cf. the same pronouns in the indicative perfective clause:(16) swə          púm nùm-u
     man/person hit 3M.O-FV
     ‘someone hit him’(17) mum ne nùm ne nàn-a
     3M give 3M.O ADP 1SG.O-FV
     ‘he gave it to me’The verb of the subjunctive clause may be followed by an object pronoun from
the perfective-subjunctive object set that reflects the person and number of
the addressee, resulting in dual reference to the subject. Use of a coreferen-
tial object pronoun in a subjunctive construction involving only one entity,
the addressee, conveys the speaker’s belief that the addressee will be indirectly
affected by the command or wish expressed by the speaker. This function is
similar to that of ‘self’ in English constructions such as ‘get yourself over here!’
or ‘have yourself a sandwich!’:(18) ì         mbə̀ ni ti   ríʔ-i

In nearly all elicited and natural discourse examples, a clause in the subjunctive
mood has a clause-initial or clause-final particle that conveys urgency, obli-
gation, permission, or politeness from the speaker’s perspective. The attested
particles include riʔ, ye, say, and mì, whose forms and functions are described
in the following sections. English translations are not word for word but are
intended to capture the different functions of the particles.","[177, 178, 179]"

3       ConclusionPévé is an active language whose speakers are well aware of the need to pre-
serve their language, cultural activities, and intercultural relations in a world
in which political, social, and economic affairs can lead to the loss of language
and traditions. The goal of the present work is to document and preserve some
of the interesting and important characteristics of Pévé for the benefit of gen-
erations to come. With respect to nomenclature, the present work adopts the
educated native-speaker Wambadang’s view that Pévé is a language distinct
from Zimé; that the term Lamé also refers to Pévé; that dialects of Pévé include
Dari, Doué, and perhaps others; that (Vun) Dzəbao, Gumaji and Herdé may
be either remote dialects of Pévé or pidgin languages that are influenced by
both Pévé and Mesme (Chadic, East Branch); and that the term Kaʔɗó (and
its variants) is not acceptable as a name for the Pévé language or culture. The
present work does not attempt to answer further questions about classification
but focuses instead on lexical and grammatical forms in Pévé and the functions
they encode.
    While Pévé shares many forms and functions with other languages of the
Chadic family, particularly those of the Masa branch, the Pévé language also has
a number of unique or unusual features. One such feature is that the choice of
pronoun(s) in a given clause is often the only means of indicating the temporal,
aspectual, and/or modal properties of the clause. In other words, the language
has a number of distinct sets of pronouns whose function is not only to indi-
cate the gender, number and syntactic role of a participant but also the tense,
aspect or mood of the clause. Despite the large system of pronouns, the gram-
matical gender system is limited to singular second- and third-person pronouns
and a small set of nouns that are inherently feminine or masculine. Another
interesting feature of Pévé is that the scope of the negative clause is that of the
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

ture is that while Pévé has a rich system of reference that distinguishes among
anaphoric, deictic, and deducible referents, nouns in Pévé are rarely marked for
number (singular or plural). The language also has a rich system of modality
that includes the unusual counterfactual mood, whereby a dedicated marker
indicates that the event described in the proposition did not occur.","[38, 39]"
"4.1       Compound Verbs
Many verbs in Pévé are derived through compounding, where a compound is
defined as two or more independent words that function as a single lexical item.
As is the case with many compounds across languages, the meaning of the com-
pound is not necessarily predictable from the meaning of its components.
    Many attested compound verbs in Pévé consist of a verb followed by a noun,
e.g. dàm kwá ‘to sew’ (dàm ‘to pluck’+kwá ‘thing’); nde ʃy ̩èn: ‘to fall asleep’
(nde ‘to fall’+ ʃyèn ‘mat, place for sleeping’); tá rəkway ‘to travel’ (tà ‘to go, to
walk’+rəkway ‘stranger’ (probably derived from the noun ri ‘place’ followed by
an unidentified morpheme)); and káwri ‘arrive’ (káw ‘grab’+ri ‘place’). There is
at least one compound with three components: gi tsoɓ kwá ‘to sell’ (gi ‘make’+
tsoɓ ‘purchase (N)’, kwá ‘thing’), which serves as a colloquial form of the com-
pound gi tsoɓ ‘to sell’.
    In some cases the noun within a compound has the same form as a verb with
a related meaning. For example, the noun tsoɓ ‘purchase’ in the compound gi
tsoɓ ‘to sell’ has the same form as the verb tsoɓ ‘to buy’, and the noun ɣaw ‘fight’
in the compound gi ɣaw ‘to cause a fight, to get into a fight’ has the same form
as the verb ɣaw ‘to fight’. For this reason, one could argue that such compounds
are actually serial verbs. If one accepts that tsoɓ and ɣaw do represent nouns,
one could argue that the noun is not part of a compound but instead func-
tions as the direct object of the preceding verb. Both approaches are addressed
below.
    Evidence that the second component of the compound verbs listed above is
a noun and not a verb, and therefore is not part of a serial verb construction,
is that the pronominal direct object following the verb is represented by a pos-
sessive pronoun from the inalienable set (see chapter 5) rather than a pronoun
from the object set. In the next example, the pronominal direct object is rep-
resented by the inalienable possessive pronoun rum. If tsoɓ were a verb in this
construction, there would be no possessum for the possessive pronoun rum to
modify:
                                                                       Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     1SG sell         3M.POSS ASSERT
     ‘I sold it’ (lit. ‘I made/caused its purchase’)Compare with the clause below, in which tsoɓ functions as a verb. Here, the
object is marked by a pronoun from the perfective direct object set (see chap-
ters 5 and 6):(15) na tsóɓ nùm si
     1SG buy 3M.O ASSERT
     ‘I bought it’Evidence that the noun within the compound does not function as the object
of the verb that precedes it is provided by the fact that another nominal or
pronominal direct object may follow the compound. In the following example,
səlay ‘money’ is the direct object of the compound verb gé də̀wã, consisting of
the verb ge ‘to throw’ followed by the noun də̀wã ‘back, nape of neck’. If də̀wã
were in fact the direct object of gé, the noun səlay could not occur in this posi-
tion:(16) kəri rùm         ndày     fáŋ kàw                Taobày ndày faŋ …

     3M.POSS-FV
     ‘Then they arrested Taobay and they returned—he gave his money—
     Monitor Lizard’s (money)—back to him.’The next example involves the compound verb gí tsoɓ ‘sell’; the direct object
mbìr ‘milk’, whose function is marked by the position after the compound verb;
and the indirect object nù, whose function as recipient is marked by the adpo-
sition ne. As there is no possible construction *S V O O IO, it is clear that tsoɓ
is part of the compound verb rather than the object of the preceding verb

     ‘I bought salt yesterday’Compound verbs of the form Verb+Noun co-exist with serial verb construc-
tions of the form Verb+Verb (see chapter 10 and later chapters). The prolifer-
ation of compound verbs and serial verbs in Pévé allows the verbal piece to
express a number of fine distinctions that in some other languages might be
expressed periphrastically or through the use of verbal extensions or modifiers.","[86, 87, 88]"

"Given the initial Stop+Stop sequence in gbə̀gbóŋ ‘strong’, and given the lack
of other three-consonant clusters, it is possible that the sequence /gb/ (and
perhaps also /kp/) represents a single consonant, rendering /mgb/ a two-
consonant cluster of the form Nasal stop+Stop.
   The few attested medial consonant clusters are very likely the result of com-
pounding or prefixing. These include mandréw ‘pimiento’; daŋgráwʔ ‘praying
mantis’; dukri ‘night’ (from duk ‘heart, middle’ ri ‘time’).
   The only attested morpheme-final clusters consist of a continuant followed
by a glottal stop:gwayʔ   ‘mountain’ vs. gwáʔ ‘to stay’
hayʔ    ‘near, next to, beside’ vs. ndày (3PL possessive pronoun)
dáŋʔ    ‘all’ vs. fáŋ ‘to return, to come back’
ʔyeŋʔ   ‘gently, weakly, sneakily’

tal stop is as follows: Repetition of the last vowel in an utterance indicates the
end of an utterance (see chapter 3). If the morpheme ends in a palatal glide,
the final added vowel is a copy of the preceding vowel:(26) handày géwa tá só          ndày-a
     3PL     return go house 3PL.POSS-FV
     ‘they went back to their house’If the morpheme to which the vowel is added ends in /y/ followed by a glottal
stop, the added vowel is /i/. This provides evidence for the contrast between /y/
and /yʔ/ in word-final position:(27) handày gáyʔ-i
     3PL      stay/rest-FV
     ‘they stayed/rested’The underlying glottal stop after a continuant is sometimes deleted at the nor-
mal rate of speech when followed by another consonant:(28) mum mbə́ záa dzənàk         gáy zə̀       gu raw
     mum mbə̀ záʔ dzənàk         gáyʔ zə̀      gú ráw
     3M come find guinea fowl sit PREP tree many
     ‘He came and found guinea fowls sitting under a tree.’4.3       Syllable and Word Structure
As noted in chapter1, the following syllable structures are attested in Pévé: V, CV,
VC, CCV(C), CCCVC (one example), and C(C) (one example: hŋ (2F indicative
subject pronoun)). The great majority of lexical and grammatical morphemes
are monosyllabic. In many instances, a polysyllabic word or morpheme shows
evidence of affixation, reduplicating, or compounding, e.g., məsín ‘other, some,
one of’ (mə REL/POSS+sín ‘different’); nambà 1PL subject (na (demonstra-
tive?)+mbà (1PL object and possessive pronoun)); kwáti ‘food’ (kwá ‘thing’+ ti
‘eat’); ryéŋ-ryéŋ(e) ‘very small, thin’ (ryéŋ ‘small, thin’). Some, but not all, poly-
syllabic words that cannot be readily broken down into monosyllabic parts are
borrowings, e.g. dəbã ́ʔ ‘tobacco’ (Fr. tabac).
   Unlike some Chadic languages, Pévé does not draw a phonological distinc-
tion between lexical categories: Nouns, verbs, other lexical morphemes, and
grammatical morphemes all share the same syllabic structure and the same
phonological constraints.","[63, 64]"

example the resumptive pronoun ti refers to the head of the relative clause:(1) [ma     mə̀ ti     ɗí   fun]
    woman REL R.PRO cook food
    ‘the woman who cooked the food …’The resumptive pronoun ni after the relative marker mə̀ may refer to either a
masculine singular head or a plural head of unspecified gender. As shown in
later sections, the resumptive pronoun is not associated with any particular
grammatical function within the relative clause or the larger construction:(2) a. [swə          mə̀ ni      ɗám so        màn        ɗám so]
       man/person REL R.PRO build house 1SG.POSS build house

         also-FV
         ‘the people who built my house built his house, too’When the relative clause itself functions as the object within a larger construc-
tion, the relative clause follows the main verb. As shown in later sections, this
is true regardless of the role of the relative head (bolded) within the relative
clause:(3) na wé [má       mə̀ ti      ɗí    fun]
    1SG see woman REL R.PRO cook food
    ‘I saw the woman who cooked the food’2.2     Deducible-Reference Marker
The end of the relative clause is often marked by a deducible-reference marker
(DED) reflecting the gender of the head of the relative clause. The marker often
has low tone, probably due to end-of-clause prosody. As shown in chapter 12,
the function of the deducible-reference markers rə (f.), nə (m.), or kunə (pl.) is
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

deducible reference marker follows a relative clause, the function of the rela-
tive clause is to narrow the scope of reference:(4) [yá náw mə̀ ɓú          rə̀]     mə̀ ná n-á
    cow        REL white DED.F REL 1SG I.PRO-FV
    ‘it is the white cow (lit. ‘the cow that is white’) that is mine’Evidence that the deducible reference marker is not a resumptive pronoun is
that the two markers can co-occur:(5) [swə mə̀ ni      ɬé nàn mbə́ ti         kə    ndi    nə̀]    bay
    man REL R.PRO take 1SG come here ASSC 3SG.O DED.M friend
    màn-à
    1SG.POSS-FV
    ‘the man who brought me here (lit. ‘took me [and] came here with me’)
    is my friend’Frajzyngier 1996 shows that in some Chadic languages the presence or absence
of a marker at the end of the relative clause is connected with the referential
status of the head of the relative clause, e.g. whether the head of the relative
clause is visible, previously mentioned, or known to the listener. As shown in
the following examples, the post-relative marker in Pévé does not encode such
distinctions:a. Known referent, followed by the phrase-final impersonal pronoun nə̀ (under-
lying form na). Use of the phrase-final marker is optional:(6) na wé      [swə mə̀ ni      mbə́ kə   rù ti (nə̀)] sí
    1SG know man REL R.PRO come ASSC 2M here DED.M ASSERT
    ‘I know the man who brought you here’b. Unknown referent, which may also be followed by the impersonal pronoun

ment followed by mə̀, has the function of object within the relative clause.
The relative marker mə̀ is usually followed by the resumptive pronoun ti or
ni, evidence that the resumptive pronoun is not associated with any particu-
lar grammatical function.
   Because the head of the relative clause is always the first component of the
relative clause, the role of a non-subject head within the relative clause must
be deduced from the presence or absence of other arguments within the rela-
tive clause. In the following example, the role of kwáti ‘food’ as object within
the relative clause is deduced from the presence of the subject pronoun ta
before the verb in the relative clause, resulting in the form O REL R.PRO S V
(DED):(8) [kwáti mə̀ ni        ta gí      nə̀] kəɗám-á
    food REL R.PRO 3F make DED.M good-FV
    ‘the food that she prepared is good’Similarly, in the next example the object role of kwá ‘thing’ is deduced from
the presence of the subject pronoun nambà before the verb within the relative
clause:(9) [kwá mə̀ tà kə         syem mə̀ ni         nambà wé nə̀]       kəlìŋ
    thing REL go ASSC feet REL R.PRO 1PL                see DED.M rat
    n-á
    I.PRO-FV
    ‘the animal (‘thing that walks on legs’) that we saw is a rat’In the preceding examples the relative clause functions as the subject of the
larger construction, in each case a verbless identificational predication (see
chapter 11). When the larger construction containing the relative clause in-
volves a predicate, the function of the relative clause as subject of the larger
construction is indicated by the position of the relative clause before the main
verb:(10) [má     mə̀ ti      ha wé rə] mbə́ si
     woman REL R.PRO 2M saw DED.F come REL
     ‘the woman you saw has come’
                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

its position after the main verb. In the following examples the relative clause is
the object of the larger construction and the head of the relative clause is the
object within the relative clause:(11) ná túk [kwátí mə̀ ní           tá gí nə̀ kə̀ɗámá]
     1SG feel food REL R.PRO 3F do DED.M good
     ‘I liked the food that she prepared.’(12) na tsóɓ       [ndáʔ mə uráʔ-a]
     1SG bought horse REL black-FV
     ‘I bought a black horse (‘horse that is black’)’ or ‘I bought the black horse’(13) handày fól          ya nãw mə̀ kə         gáɓ kunə tsóp-ó
     3PL      slaughter cow REL ASSC illness PL first-FV
     ‘they slaughter the sick cows (lit. ‘cows that are with illness’) first’The head of the relative clause can function as indirect object within the rel-
ative clause. The role of the head as indirect object is deduced from the fact
that the verb in the relative clause is followed by two arguments (see sə (3F.O)
and ɗerwa ‘book’ in example 14, below). As shown in chapter 6, when two
arguments follow the verb, the first argument after the verb has the function
of indirectly affected object, in this case the recipient. Note that the indirect
object head of the relative clause is represented by the resumptive pronoun ti:(14) na wə         gi lekol wanji      kə      [vay ma      mə ti na
     1SG IMPF do school together ASSC child female REL R.PRO 1SG

     ‘I go to the same school as the girl to whom I gave a book’As shown in the preceding and following examples, the relative clause may
function as the object of a preposition within the larger construction. As is the
case with other prepositional phrases, the relative clause follows the preposi-
tion:(15) múm mbə́ kə          [kwá mə̀ ní          há né nùm nə       sí]
     3M come ASSC thing REL R.PRO 2M give 3M DED.M EE

tive clause, where ‘adjunct’ means a lexical item, phrase, or clause that can
be added to almost any construction (see chapter 21). The role of the head as
addressee within the relative clause is marked by the associative preposition
kə followed by a pronoun from the set coding inalienable possession/object of
a preposition (see chapter 5). The function of the relative clause as subject of
the larger construction is marked, as elsewhere, by the position of the relative
clause before the main verb:(16) [má     mə ti      na ge dàn                  mə kə  sə wə

     ‘the woman whom I talked with in Maroua has arrived’The locative role of the head of the relative clause can be marked by the demon-
strative han, which indicates anaphoric reference to a location that is not the
place of speech (see chapter 12). When the head of the relative clause is a loca-
tive complement, the resumptive pronoun has the masculine/plural form ni:(17) ɓay [mota         mə̀nahã                    rawtirùm]
     ɓay [mota         mə        ni na han rawti             rùm]

     ‘Then the car that I was sitting in there managed to cross the river at four
     o’clock in the morning.’Like other relative clauses, the clause with a locative head may be followed by a
deducible reference marker (in bold). As elsewhere, the object role of the rela-
tive clause in the larger sentence is marked by the position of the relative clause
after the main verb:
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

5       Deictic Relative ClausesIn nearly all of the examples cited above there is a predicate within the relative
clause. Exceptions are equational, identificational and other predications that
are verbless as stand-alone clauses. When the relative clause does not contain
a predicate, the resumptive pronouns ni and ti function as markers of proximal
deixis, as in the following examples:(19) [swə mə̀ ni       nə]      púm nùm-u
     man REL R.PRO DED.M hit 3M-FV
     ‘the man who is here hit him’In the following sentence, the relative clause functions as the head of another
relative clause:(20) [ya nãw mə̀ ni        kunə] mə̀ handày n-á
     cow      REL R.PRO DED.PL REL 3PL.POSS I.PRO-FV
     ‘these cows (‘cows that are here’) are theirs (‘that are theirs’)’It is very likely that the proximal demonstratives ti and ni are the source of the
resumptive pronouns ti and ni. Evidence that ti and ni in a verbless relative
clause have a function that is different from the function of ti and ni in a relative
clause that involves a predicate is provided by the fact that the distal demon-
stratives dáyʔ (fem.) and náyʔ (masc.) can also be used in a verbless relative
clause:(21) [ya nãw mə dáyʔ rə́]               mə mùm            n-á
     cow      REL DIST.F DED.F REL 3M.POSS I.PRO-FV
     ‘that cow is his’ (lit. ‘the cow that is there is his’)(22) [mi mə̀ náyʔ] su

     ‘what is that?’
                                                                       Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

the deictic demonstrative. The significance of this variation remains to be
explored:(23) à kat [sõwã (mə) náyʔ            kun-a]
     2M look people (REL) DIST.M DED.PL-FV
     ‘look at those people (‘people who are there’)!’The deducible reference marker can co-occur with the resumptive pronoun ni
or ti in the deictic function, as it can in the non-deictic function:(24) [swə (mə̀) ni     nə]       púm nùm-u
     man REL R.PRO DED.M hit 3M-FV
     ‘this man (‘man who is here’) hit him’
6       ConclusionThe basic form of the relative clause is Noun REL R.PRO … (DED), where Noun
is the head of the relative clause, REL is the relative marker mə, R.PRO is a
resumptive pronoun that reflects the number and gender (if singular) of the
head of the relative clause, and DED is a deducible-reference determiner from
the set rə (fem.), nə (masc.), and kunə (pl.), described in chapter 12. The pres-
ence of the deducible-reference determiner at the end of the relative clause
indicates that the function of the clause is to narrow the scope of reference for
the hearer. The resumptive pronouns ti and ni are probably derived from the
proximal deictic demonstratives discussed in chapter 12. Evidence for this is
that ti or ni functions as a deictic demonstrative in a relative clause that does
not contain a predicate. In all instances, the syntactic function of the relative
clause within the larger construction is indicated by the position of the relative
clause with respect to the main verb and by the presence or absence of other
arguments in the larger construction.","[267, 268, 269, 270, 271, 272, 273, 274]"

"2.6      Glottal Stop: ʔ
In at least one instance, the word-initial glottal stop contrasts with the word-
initial vowel: ʔi ‘to insult’ vs. ì (2PL subjunctive subject pronoun). In word-final
position, the glottal stop contrasts with the voiceless velar stop (and other con-
sonants):dzòʔ     ‘to plant’; ‘to scoop up a paste’ vs. dzòk ‘to pound grain with a mortar
         and pestle’
gaʔ      ‘side’ vs. gàk ‘to be able’The primary evidence for the glottal stop as a phoneme is provided by a large
number of minimal pairs with word-final glottal stops vs. word-final vowels:tʃiʔ     ‘to cry’ vs. tʃi ‘to kill’, ‘to weave’
ʃeʔe     ‘tooth’; ‘egg’ (homonym) vs. ʃe ‘to fall, to rain’
gã ́ʔ   ‘broth made with cold water and grain’ vs. gã ‘brush, shrubs’
soʔ      ‘cold’ (ADJ) vs. sò ‘bone’

as is the case with the adverbial sə́dayʔ in the following:(1) mum gyɛ́wambə̀         sə́day
    mum géwa        mbə sədayʔ
    3M return       come two.days.later
    ‘He came back two days later.’Evidence for the word-final glottal stop is that the glottal stop is retained when
the morpheme is followed by a final vowel (FV; see chapter 3):(2) mum géwa mbə sədayʔ-a
    3M return come two.days.later-FV
    ‘He came back two days later.’An epenthetic glottal stop may precede a word-initial vowel to place empha-
sis on the word or morpheme that follows. The glottal stop may occur between
consecutive vowels, as in the example below:(3) gewa ʔà          fãye
    gewa à           faŋ  ye
    return 2M.SBJV repeat PERM
    ‘“Go back again!”’The epenthetic glottal stop with the emphatic function can also occur between
a word-final consonant and a word-initial vowel:(4) ɛɛ kəri mə̀ní … mum ʔín ne nùm ndə́ naʔ-a ….
    ɛɛ kəri mə̀ni mum ín ne nùm ndə́ naʔ-a ….
    eh when         3M say ADP 3M.O like I.PRO-FV
    ‘When he told him that …’2.7     Glottal Fricative: h
The contrast between the initial glottal fricative /h/ and an initial vowel is
found in a few lexical items:     hu ‘goat’ vs. ú ‘millet’
     hoɓ ‘two’ vs. o ‘to ask’
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

Pévé distinguishes among the velar stops /k/ and /g/, the velar nasal /ŋ/, and
velar fricative /ɣ/:/k/        ka ‘where’; kə (associative preposition); ku ‘fire’
/g/        gàk ‘to be able’; ge ‘to throw’; gú ‘tree’
/ŋ/        ŋak ‘crowned crane’ (bird)
/ɣ/        ɣaw ‘fight’ (N); ɣàr ‘to hurry’In word-final position, the velar nasal /ŋ/ contrasts with the alveolar nasal /n/:tʃiriŋ     ‘deep’ vs. tʃin ‘to place, to put’
nàŋ        (2F object pronoun) vs. nàn (1SG object pronoun)The velar nasal may carry tone, as evidenced by the form hŋ́ , a variant of the
form hə́ŋ (2F indicative subject pronoun). In the form ŋ̀ , a variant of the 2F sub-
junctive subject pronoun ə̀ŋ, the velar nasal is syllabic and carries the low tone
of the underlying form:(5) ŋ̀        làʔ sə́ tə̀        mbə̀ ye
    2F.SBJV say 3F.O 3F.SBJV come PERM
    ‘(you) tell her she should come’There are a few instances where /kw/ and /gw/ contrast with non-labialized
stops:/kw/       kwá ‘thing’ vs. ka ‘where’
/gw/       gwaʔ ‘then’ vs. gaʔ ‘side’Given that the labialized velar stops are rare in the language, it is likely that
/kw/ and /gw/ have their origins in a stop followed by a round vowel, as has
been posited for other labialized consonants. Support for this is provided by
free variants such go ~ gwaʔ ‘then’. However, given the contrasting pairs above,
the labialized velars are considered phonemic.","[50, 51, 52]"

coding semantic relations                                                         131   The fact that the role of the indirect object must be overtly marked in the
absence of the direct object provides evidence that the semantic role of the
indirect object is distinct from that of the direct object. The nature of the
semantic role depends on the inherent properties of the verb, the subject,
the indirect object, and the direct object, if present. The semantic roles of
indirect object arguments include the recipient of a thing given, sold or pro-
cured; the viewer of a thing shown; the beneficiary of the event; the addressee
of certain verbs; and the entity that suffers from the event (‘malefactive’; see
below). Here are examples of indirect objects with the semantic role of recipi-
ent:(24) na də̀ wũ ne hu

     ‘I will give you a goat’(25) à          də̀ kyeɓ ɬew ne mbà riʔ-i

     3F sell    milk few, small give 1SG.O-FV
     ‘she sold me a little milk’Recall that when the indirect object is represented by a noun rather than a
pronoun, the indirect object can be marked by the associative preposition kə,
which may or may not be preceded by the adposition ne. The presence or
absence of ne in the construction with kə does not affect the semantic role of
the marked object:(27) Taú ne kwa (ne) kə            ndzar rum  kuni kə́dàn ti
     T. give thing ADP ASSC sisters 3M.POSS DED.PL PURP eat
     ‘Tau gave his sisters something to eat.’Recall that pronouns coding alienable possession are from the same set as those
that code the direct or indirect object in a non-perfective clause (see chapters 5
and 6). Certain pronouns, namely sá (3F), mbà (1PL), and ndày (3PL.POSS and
variant of the 3PL subject marker [ha]ndày), have the same form when coding
inalienable possession or the perfective object. Because of this functional over-
lap, the adposition ne is sometimes the only indicator of the semantic role of
the pronominal indirect object:
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

of an event that does not involve transfer of an object:(30) mum kura         ʃìnè ne nàn-a

the alienable set:(33) ta ɓá     só     màn-a

     ‘she cleaned my room’The indirect object can also be the viewer of a thing shown, which may be
abstract or concrete:

     ‘They told us we should leave the town (‘the village that is large’).’When the verb of saying is a compound verb, the addressee is marked as the
possessor of the nominal constituent of the compound verb:(38) handày tsí vún mbà           i      mum ndzə̀r mbà            su
     3PL      ask     1PL.POSS COMP 3M brother 1PL.POSS Q
     ‘they asked us (lit. ‘asked our mouth’) if he is our brother’Some languages have a dedicated means of indicating that the effect of the
event on a participant was malefactive, i.e., that the participant was negatively
affected by the event. Pévé does not make this distinction; instead the same
means used in the recipient and benefactive predications described above can
be used in malefactive predications, as shown below. Like the nominal recip-
ient or beneficiary, the negatively affected participant in the perfective clause
is marked by the sequence (ne) kə:                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

5       SourceNouns that do not represent the subject, direct object, or indirect object may
be marked for a variety of semantic roles. One such role is the source of a thing
given or purchased, marked by the preposition ɓá ‘from’, derived from the noun
ɓá ‘hand’. The preposition is followed by a noun or an inalienable possessive
pronoun:(42) na tsóɓ ɓá                ndzar rú

6         ReciprocalA reciprocal predication is defined here as a predication in which the refer-
ents denoted by a plural subject noun or pronoun act simultaneously upon one
another: X acts on Y and Y acts on X. This function in Pévé is coded by the recip-
rocal marker ndʒì at the end of the clause:(47) handày púm ndʒì
     3PL        hit RECIP
     ‘they hit each other’(48) nambà wə́        ge dàn             mbòk    ndʒì
     1PL       IMPF talk (‘throw words’) between RECIP
     ‘we are talking to each other’(49) handày mbə́ kə́dàn handày káw ɓá                  ndʒì
     3PL     come PURP 3PL          help (‘grab hand’) RECIP
     ‘they came to help each other’Compare the non-reciprocal form, where X acts on Y but Y does not act on X.
In this case, the marker ndʒ̩i does not occur:(50) handày géwa tá só          ndày-a
     3PL      return go house 3PL.POSS-FV
     ‘they returned to their home’
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

‘head’, which also functions as the preposition ‘on’ (see chapter 10):(51) nambà mbə́ gí sin wa ndʒì
     1PL    come do work head RECIP
     ‘we came here to work together’When the reciprocal marker ndʒì is preceded by the associative preposition kə,
the subject referents did not act on one another but instead acted jointly. The
function of ndʒì is this very similar to the function of ‘each other’ in English,
where ‘they hit each other’ codes the reciprocal function and ‘they went with
each other’ codes a joint action:(52) handày tá Garoua kə      ndʒì
     3PL     go G.       ASSC RECIP
     ‘they went to Garoua’
7       Coreferentiality of Subject and ObjectIn the coreferential construction, the controlling argument (subject) and the
non-controlling/affected argument (object) have the same referent. (Corefer-
entiality in the complex sentence, e.g. between an argument in the matrix
clause and an argument in the complement clause, is described in chapter 19,
section 2.1.1). Coreferentiality within the clause is marked by use of the noun tú
‘body’ in object position followed by a possessive pronoun coreferential with
the subject. The pronoun has the form that is used to code inalienable posses-
sion (chapter 5):(53) mum gé kəlam                      tu rùm-u
     3M injure (lit. ‘throw accident’) body 3M.POSS-FV
     ‘he hurt himself’(54) dàw úr        ndáʔ kə     tú ndày-á
     child mount horse ASSC body 3PL.POSS-FV
     ‘the children made themselves mount the horse’ (lit. ‘mounted the horse
     with their bodies’)Compare the non-coreferential form, where the subject and the affected argu-
ment have different referents and the noun tú ‘body’ does not occur. In the
                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

the second component of the compound verb is a noun (see above and chap-
ter 4):(55) mum gé kəlam rùm-ù
     3M hurt         3M.POSS-FV
     ‘he1 hurt him2’In the coreferential construction, the possessive pronoun can be omitted if it is
clear that the possessor of the noun tú ‘body’ is coreferential with the subject:(56) mum géwa tà só        um        ɓay mum mbì       tú
     3M return go house 3M.POSS CONJ 3M wash (‘water’) body
     ‘he went back home and washed (him)self’When the affected argument is a body part with a third-person possessor, there
is no distinction between coreferentiality of the subject and object (reflexive)
and absence of coreferentiality:(57) mum háy syem            rùm-ù
     3M cut leg, foot 3M.POSS-FV
     ‘he1 cut his1 leg’ or ‘he1 cut his2 leg’
8        ConclusionThe semantic role of the subject may be controlling or non-controlling, affected
or unaffected, without additional marking. Although there is no passive con-
struction, the subject of a transitive verb in the construction Subject Verb can
represent the affected argument, without additional marking. Whether or not
the subject is affected is a function of the nature of the verb, the nature of the
subject argument, and the context.
   The semantic role of the direct object may be that of the affected object
or the object of perception. Semantic roles of the indirect object, as coded by
the means described in chapter 7, include recipient, beneficiary, malefactive,
addressee, and others. Semantic functions coded by additional means include
source, reciprocal, and reflexive.","[146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153]"

2        Phonological Structure of the VerbUnlike in some Chadic languages (Pero, Frajzyngier 1989; Gidar, Frajzyngier
2008; and perhaps others), where verbs and nouns have different phonological
structures, all lexical and grammatical items in Pévé appear to have the same
phonological structures. All of the syllable structures that are attested in verbs
are also found in nouns, modifiers, adjuncts, and grammatical morphemes, and
there are some homophonous verbs and nouns that do not appear to be related,
e.g. dʒí ‘to tend, to watch over’ vs. dʒí ‘dense forest’.
   The majority of verbs in Pévé are monosyllabic and have the form CV or CVC.
A few verbs are attested with an initial or final consonant cluster, often involv-
ing a word-initial or word-final glottal stop. A few vowel-initial verbs are also
recorded. Here are examples of the monosyllabic forms attested in Pévé verbs:V          o ‘to ask’
VC         il ‘to scoop a liquid’
CV         ve ‘to take’, ʔi ‘to insult’, pã ‘to leave’
CCV        ʔna ‘to throw away’
CVC        ɮaʔ ‘to dance’, par ‘to remove’, ndzay ‘to pour grain’
CCVC       krùt ‘to undress’, plaʔ ‘to push’
CVCV       gewa ‘to return (intrans.)’
CVCVC      pemãy ‘to rest’

pounding: ge ‘to throw’+wa ‘head’ (N). It is likely that other polysyllabic verbs
are also the result of compounding, though their component meanings are not
necessarily obvious. Compounding is discussed in detail in section 4.1.","[82, 83]"

         chapter 3Parsing Morphology1        IntroductionMany lexical and grammatical morphemes in Pévé show an alternation be-
tween the phrase-internal form and the phrase-final form, which consists of
the phrase-internal form with an added final vowel. A phrase-final vowel can
be added to any morpheme whose citation form ends in a consonant, provided
that grammatical rules allow the morpheme to occur in phrase-final position.
A morpheme that has no meaning unless it is followed by additional material
does not undergo phrase-final vowel addition.
   As illustrated below, use of the phrase-final form of a given morpheme tells
the listener that the morpheme is the final component of the grammatical con-
stituent to which it belongs; in other words, that the constituent contains all
of the information that the speaker wishes to include, regardless of whether
the constituent is grammatically complete. A morpheme in phrase-internal
form, in contrast, tells the listener to expect more material within the same
constituent. With respect to final vowel alternation, the terms ‘phrase-internal
form’ and ‘phrase-final form’ are used for simplicity. The term ‘parsing morphol-
ogy’ refers to the alternation between phrase-internal forms and phrase-final
forms and the functions they perform.","[69, 70]"

2        Indicative ClausesIn most instances, negation of the indicative clause is coded by the negative
marker tsú immediately after the subject noun or pronoun and the negative
marker mì at the end of the clause. Following are examples in various aspects

occur in negative clauses. For example, in the future tense there is an alterna-
tion between the form S Tense/Aspect V O IO ne and the form S Tense/Aspect
IO V O (see chapter 8). Either form can be negated by the same means, namely
post-subject tsú and clause-final mì:S NEG Tense/Aspect V O IO ne NEG:(7) na tsú də̀ gi tsoɓ ya nãw màn          ùm ne mì

The markers may occur in succession or may be separated by other constitu-
ents:(9) mə̀ na tsu mi

     ‘she has money’Neither of the negative markers tsú or mì can be omitted when the negative
clause is used in isolation, and most negative clauses in natural discourse also
use both negative markers. However, tsú can be omitted in a negative clause
that is a response to a question:(13) Taú (tsú) tá lúmò mì
     T. NEG go market NEG
     ‘Tau didn’t go to the market’ (in response to ‘Did he go to the market?’)As shown in chapter 9, the marker tsú is also not used in the prohibitive

     ‘do not buy any clothing for me!’The assertive marker si cannot be used in the negative clause. This supports
the analysis that si codes the assertive mood, i.e. the speaker’s desire that the
hearer believe in the occurrence of an event (see chapter 9):(17) handày tsú tsóɓ ya nãw mì *si
     3PL      NEG buy cow NEG ASSERT
     for ‘they did not buy a cow’The sequence zaʔ mi (‘more NEG’) indicates the temporal status of the negated

context and intonation:(20) ha tsú táʔ l’école dimanche nə       zaʔ mi
     2M NEG go to school Sunday DED.M more NEG
     ‘you no longer go to Sunday school?’The negated clause can also be followed by the interrogative marker su. Note
that the following clause also involves the permissive modality marker ye (see
chapter 9), evidence that modality is a distinct domain:

     ing)
3       Scope of NegationElicited examples suggest that the scope of negation in Pévé is the entire propo-
sition rather than an entity involved in the proposition. Attempts to elicit sen-
tences in which one referent with a given grammatical role is negated while
another referent with the same grammatical role is not negated resulted in sep-
arate clauses: a negative clause and an affirmative clause. Following is a Pévé
translation of the English construction ‘he bought a cow, not a goat’:(22) mum tsóɓ ya nãw àmá          mum tsú tsóɓ hu mì
     3M buy cow but (Ar.) 3M NEG buy goat NEG
     ‘he bought a cow, but he did not buy a goat’Translation of the English ‘he doesn’t buy mine, only yours’ also results in two
separate clauses:(23) mum tsú tsoɓ mə na kpe mì ama                      mum tsoɓ mə
     3M NEG buy PREP 1SG never NEG but (Ar.) 3M buy PREP
     ha taw sar-a
     2M only-FV
     ‘he never buys (what is) mine; he only buys (what is) yours’
4       ConclusionMost negative clauses involve the marker tsú after the subject noun or pronoun
and the marker mì at the end of the clause. The negative marker tsú can be omit-
ted in a prohibitive clause or in a negative clause that is a response to a question.
Tense and aspect are coded in the negative clause as they are in the affirmative
clause. The scope of negation is the entire clause, not a single constituent.","[252, 253, 254, 255, 256]"

the following:/p/     zup ‘to cook/simmer’

whose function is to mark the end of the utterance, all of the consonants listed
above can also occur in intervocalic position (suk-u ‘to stay in a place-FV’ tʃiriŋ-
i ‘deep-FV’, etc.). There are a few consonants that are attested in intervocalic
position within the word but are not attested in word-final position. Many of
the words with a word-internal intervocalic consonant are borrowed or show
evidence of derivation via affixation or compounding:/d/     kədàn (purpose marker) (associative preposition kə +dàn ‘word’)
/ts/    àtsíw ‘knife’

"6.3     Modification by a Noun
Section 5 demonstrates that when the first noun in the sequence Noun1 Noun2
codes gender or relative size, Noun1 functions as modifier of Noun2. When
Noun1 does not code gender or relative size, Noun2 is the modifier of Noun1:(40) na ti ɬew nãw kúm-ú
     1SG eat meat bovine yesterday-FV
     ‘I ate beef (‘bovine meat’) yesterday’When the second noun in the sequence Noun1 Noun2 has an animate referent,
Noun2 usually functions as the possessor of Noun1:(41) mum wə́        só      dʒwa
     3M IMPF house chief
     ‘he is in the chief’s house’(42) na wàʔ i            à         tsar gaɓ vay màn
     1SG want COMP 2M.SBJV lift illness child 1SG.POSS
     ‘I want you to heal my child’ (‘lift my child’s illness’)In the structure Noun1 Noun2, there is no structural distinction between the
noun as attributive modifier and the noun as possessor:(43) fə̀tà lúmò tá wə́      gi tsoɓ súm-u
     day market 3F IMPF sell        beer-FV

     people M.
     ‘the people of Maroua/the Maroua people’There is no evidence of a sequence of adjectives modifying the same head
noun, as in ‘big black horse’ or ‘her black horse’. Solicited sentences with an

the form S V O Possessor REL Adjective:(45) na gəɓó mota Taú mə uraʔ                 n-a

modifies the noun that precedes it. If the referent is animate, the relationship
coded is that of possession:(48) ta tá só      bay Gàm

modifies (section 5), it is sometimes difficult to say whether Noun1 modifies
Noun2 or vice versa when both nouns have animate referents. The meaning of
the next examples could be ‘female child’ vs. ‘male child’ (Modifier Noun) or
‘small female’ vs. ‘small male’ (Noun Modifier):(50) vay ma

     ‘the woman you saw has come’Similarly, the feminine marker ya, which marks the gender of an animate entity
or the size of an inanimate entity (sections 5.1–5.2), may also function as the
head of a noun phrase:(53) ya       vay wə́        ne kwáti kə        vay
     mother child IMPF give food ASSC child
     ‘the child’s mother is feeding her child’ (not ‘female child’ or ‘large child’)The sequence Noun1 Noun2 thus has different functions and interpretations,
depending on shared information and surrounding discourse. The sequence
Noun1 Noun2 can also function as a compound noun, discussed in section 9.1.","[104, 105, 106]"

The language distinguishes between the labio-velar glide /w/ and the palatal
glide /y/ in word-initial position:/w/     wa ‘head’ (N); we ‘to see’
/y/     ya ‘mother’; ye (marker of permission)In word-final position, the glides /w/ and /y/ contrast with one another and
with word-final vowels. The final palatal glide is attested only after the low
vowel /a/, while the final labiovelar glide is attested after /a/ and the front vow-
els /i/ and /e/:ɓay     ‘and’ (conjunction) vs. ɓá ‘hand’ (noun)
yaw     ‘miracle’ vs. ya ‘mother’
ɬew     ‘meat’ vs. ɬé ‘take’
síw     ‘tomorrow’ vs. si (assertive marker)The evidence that the final glide is consonantal is provided by examining pars-
ing morphology (see Frajzyngier 2016b) in Pévé. Parsing morphology, described
in detail in chapter 3, involves a phrase-final marker whose function is to
tell the listener that the preceding phrase is complete. Parsing morphology
in Pévé involves adding a final vowel to a morpheme whose underlying form
is consonant-final. The added final vowel, glossed ‘FV’, is a copy of the vowel
that precedes the underlying final consonant. The adverbial corresponding to
‘today’ has the form tám in isolation or phrase-internal position and the form
tám-a in phrase-final position:(6) mum tá lúmò kə          sə́ tám-a
    3M go market ASSC 3F.O today-FV
    ‘he went to the market with her today’A phrase-final vowel cannot be added to a morpheme whose underlying form
ends in a vowel. This provides a tool for determining whether the final vowel of
the morpheme is underlying or not:(7) Gwà tá lúmò kúm            kə́dàn tsoɓ keve-*e
    G. go market yesterday PURP buy fish-*FV
    for ‘Gwa went to the market yesterday to buy fish’ [keve ‘fish’]

an underlying consonant and not a part of a diphthong. The added vowel is a
copy of the vowel preceding the glide:(8) mum ne ʒyè         ɗáw-a

Pévé distinguishes between the lateral /l/ and the rhotic /r/, realized as a short
trill:/l/     làʔ ‘say’; lúmò ‘market’ (Ful.)
/r/     raʔ ‘gather (things)’; rìn 1SG possessive pronoun; rù 2M possessive pro-
        noun; ri ‘time, space’2.11    Lateral Fricatives: ɬ, ɮ
The voiceless lateral fricative /ɬ/ contrasts with the voiced lateral fricative /ɮ/
and with the lateral liquid /l/. All three occur in word-initial position:/ɬ/     ɬé ‘to take’; ɬew or ɬyew ‘meat’
/ɮ/     ɮe ‘to start, to pass’; ɮaʔ ‘to dance’

only in open syllables or before a glottal stop. The lax vowels /ɪ, ɛ, ɔ, ʊ/ occur

sponding tense vowels /i, e, o, u/. The high central vowel, transcribed as /ə/ in
accordance with Chadic linguistic tradition, is very frequent but is not phone-
mic, as shown below.13.1    Oral Vowels
Evidence that the five oral vowels are phonemic is provided by minimal or near-
minimal pairs in open syllables:/i/       gi ‘to do, to make’; ki ‘back (side)’; yii ‘squirrel’
/e/       ge ‘to throw (at a target)’ kè (copula); ye (modal particle)
/a/       gaʔ ‘side’; ka ‘where’ (question word); ya ‘female’
/o/       noʔ ‘near’; sò ‘bone’; pocʔ ‘to pay’
/u/       gú ‘tree, wood’, ku ‘fire’; su (interrogative particle)All of the vowels above are contrastive in closed syllables as well:/i/       ʃin ‘work’
/e/       ʃyèn ‘to sleep’
/a/       ndzar ‘sister’
/o/       tsoɓ ‘purchase’ (N)
/u/       ndzur ‘cousin’There is a phonetic alternation between the tense vowels /i, e, o, u/ in open
syllables and the lax vowels /ɪ, ɛ, ɔ, ʊ/ in closed syllables. Because lax vowels do
not appear in any instance to be phonemic, any lax vowels in transcriptions are
surface manifestations of underlying tense vowels.","[52, 53, 54, 55]"
"6.4       Possessive Pronouns
Pévé has two distinct sets of possessive pronouns. In keeping with Chadic lin-
guistic tradition, these sets are labeled ‘alienable’ vs. ‘inalienable’. It should
be noted, however, that the class to which a given lexical item belongs is a
language-specific question and is not based on the nature of the real-world ref-
erent.
    Table 5 shows the two sets of possessive pronouns. Note that wherever there
is a distinction between the inalienable and the alienable possessive pronoun,
the inalienable pronoun begins with the consonant /r/. This is true even when
the inalienable pronoun is not obviously derived from the alienable form. The
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

presence of the initial /r/ thus suggests traces of an earlier pre-pronominal
marker whose function was to indicate inalienable possession. Interestingly,
pronouns from the inalienable possessive set also serve as objects of prepo-
sitions, while pronouns from the alienable possessive set are identical with
object pronouns from the unmarked (‘non-perfective’) set (see chapter 6).
    The category of inalienable possession includes body-part terms and certain
lexical items corresponding to family relations, including ‘wife’, ‘brother’, and
‘sister’:(54) hum/i rìn
     ear/eye 1SG.POSS
     ‘my ear(s)/eye(s)’(55) ɓá rum
     hand 3M.POSS

     hand 2PL.POSS
     ‘your (2PL) hands’In the next example the inalienable possessive pronoun modifies the noun
syem ‘time, occurrence’. A possible explanation for this is that the form syem
also denotes the body part ‘foot’, which may well be the source of the abstract
noun syem:(59) syem híndʒiʔ rùm   n-a
     time three 3M.POSS DED.M-FV
     ‘the third time’The much broader category of alienable possession includes nouns denoting
other family relationships, including ‘child’, ‘mother’, ‘father’, and ‘husband’;
nouns corresponding to ‘friend’, ‘house’, and ‘home’; nouns with non-human
animate referents; and nouns with inanimate referents:(60) ya/ba/ndʒí             màn
     mother/father/husband 1SG.POSS

     house/name/cow/story 2M.POSS
     ‘your (m.) house/name/cow/story’Pévé speakers without formal education tend to use the alienable form, rather
than the inalienable form, with nouns corresponding to ‘wife’, ‘brother’, and
‘sister’:(64) ma wũ (not rù)
     wife 2M.POSS
     for ‘your wife’                                                                    Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

     ‘he showed himself (‘his body’) to me’ (inalienable)In some cases the choice between inalienable and alienable possessor indicates
a referential distinction. In this example, the alienable possessive pronoun
refers to the person who named the price:(69) tsoɓ màn (alienable)
     price 1SG.POSS
     ‘my price’ (for my merchandise)In the next example, use of the inalienable possessive pronoun codes reference
to the price itself:(70) tsoɓ rùm (inalienable)
     price 3M.POSS
     ‘its (lit. ‘his’) price’Again, the function of the inalienable possessive pronoun vs. the alienable
possessive pronoun depends in part on shared information and surrounding
discourse.","[106, 107, 108, 109]"

         chapter 5Nouns and the Noun Phrase1        IntroductionA noun is defined here as a lexical item that functions, without additional mark-
ing, as an argument of a verbal or verbless predication. This chapter describes
the phonological structure of nouns in Pévé, the morphology of nouns, the
derivation of nouns from other lexical categories, and the structures and func-
tions of various types of noun phrases. The chapter also describes the forms
and functions of various lexical and grammatical morphemes used to modify
nouns, including adjectives, determiners, possessive pronouns, numerals, and
quantifiers.
   Modifiers in noun phrases can be divided into two broad categories: those
that precede the head noun (prenominal) and those that follow the head noun
(postnominal). The first category consists of a finite set of nouns that code
the natural gender of the head-noun referent, the relative size of the referent,
the relative age of the referent, and the inherent importance of the referent.
All other modifiers follow the head noun. These modifiers include attributive
adjectives, numerals, quantifiers, nouns in the possessive function, possessive
pronouns, and determiners coding deictic and anaphoric reference (see also
chapter 12). The form of the noun phrase is thus (Noun) Head (Adjective) (Pos-
sessor) (Determiner). In this form the noun before the head noun is limited to
a marker of gender or relative size, and the possessor may be a pronoun from
the possessive set or a noun in the possessive function.
   Nominal morphology in Pévé consists of parsing morphology, described in
chapter 3; nomen agentis prefixes; and compounding. Most Pévé nouns do not
code a singular vs. plural distinction. Plurality of the noun may be understood
from context or may be indicated by use of a plural adjective, a plural deter-
miner, or an inherently plural verb. A handful of suppletive plural nouns have
also been recorded. Apart from a few nouns that code natural gender and the
small set of prenominal modifiers that also code natural gender (section 5.1),
the grammatical gender system in Pévé is limited to second- and third-person
pronouns that code either masculine or feminine gender (see chapter 6).

nouns are attested. The phonotactic constraints that apply to verbs (see chap-
ter 4) apply to nouns as well. Here are examples of the attested structures of
nouns in Pévé:V      ú ‘guinea corn’; i ‘eye’
CV     kú ‘fire’ (N); mbì ‘water’
VCV    àdə́ ‘dog’ (də́ or dá, for some speakers)
CCV    zrá ‘hole’
CCCV   kwra ‘agriculture’
CVC    gi ‘boule’, ‘food’; gám ‘male goat’; nẽʔ ‘hippopotamus’ or ‘curse’
       (homonyms)
CCVC   mbraw ‘cotton’, ‘shirt’, ‘clothing’; tràk ‘shoe(s)’; gbəgboŋ ‘strength,
       force’; blim ‘(type of) drum’
CVCCV dukrí ‘night’
CCVCC drayʔ ‘pestle’
CCCVC mblam ‘route, road’; mgbəmgbuŋ ‘lumbar region’, ‘basin’
CVCV   keve ‘fish’; bə̀kà ‘morning’; rə̀ɓà ‘bouillie’
CVCVC  dzənàk ‘guinea fowl’
CVCCVC dòknay ‘wealth’; boknáy ‘elephant’
3       NumberThere is no morphological marker of singularity or plurality on the noun in
Pévé. For human referents there are a few instances of suppletive plurals, e.g.:     vay ‘child’           dàw ‘children’
     swə ‘person, someone’ sowã ‘people’ (< swə+wã)There are also a few instances of plurals derived through compounding, where
the compound plural form may or may not share any morphemes with the sin-
gular form:     ma ‘woman’ vs. rawkwa ‘women’ (raw ‘many’+kwa ‘thing’)
     səmàndʒí ‘man’ (swə ‘person’ > [sə] +mà (REL)+ndʒí ‘male’) vs. ndʒí-
       wkwa ‘men’ (ndʒí ‘male’+kwa ‘thing’)
                                                                   Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

context or on shared knowledge of the speaker and hearer:(1) handày tsóɓ hu
    3PL     buy goat(s)
    ‘they bought a goat/some goats’The singular or plural nature of the noun can be specified by a numeral or an
inherently plural quantifier in the position after the noun:(2) handày tsóɓ hu ɗáw-á
    3PL     buy goat one-FV
    ‘they bought a/one goat’Compare with the use of a plural quantifier, where hu remains unchanged:(3) handày tsóɓ hu raw-a
    3PL     buy goat many-FV
    ‘they bought many goats’or:(4) ha tsóɓ    hu madak              su
    2M bought goat how many/how much Q
    ‘how many goats did you buy?’As shown in chapter 4, the choice of verb sometimes indicates singularity or
plurality of the subject or object. In this case, no other marker of nominal plu-
rality is necessary (examples 34 and 35 from chapter 4, repeated here):(5) nambà ɬé          tímbì
    1PL     take (SG) calabash
    ‘we took a calabash’(6) nambà ráʔ         tímbì
    1PL     take (PL) calabash
    ‘we took some/many calabashes’Plurality of the noun can also be coded by post-nominal modifiers, discussed
in section 5 below.","[92, 93, 94, 95]"

2        Identificational PredicationAn identificational predication, as defined in the present work, tells the hearer
how to identify an entity that is visible to the hearer or has been previously
mentioned in discourse (cf. Moltmann 2013). The form of the identificational
clause in Pévé is Noun (Modifier) na, where na functions as an impersonal pro-
noun. This function is similar to that of the English forms ‘that’, ‘this’, ‘those’,
‘these’ or ‘it’ in identificational clauses (note the translations below), albeit the
Pévé predication does not code distinctions in number or proximity. The imper-
sonal pronoun na is used in contrast with the copula kè (see sections 3 and 4,
below).
   An identificational predication may consist solely of the subject noun fol-
lowed by the impersonal pronoun na:(1) tʃime na
    sheep I.PRO
    ‘it/that is a sheep’ (the sheep is visible)

    mum láʔ i          Taobày
    3M say COMP T.
    ‘He said Taobay …’The head noun may be followed by a modifying word or phrase, which precedes
the impersonal pronoun:(5) ndáʔ sə́          na
    horse 3F.POSS I.PRO
    ‘it/that is her horse’(6) ndáʔ uráʔ-a na

    ‘the black horse …’(10) ya naw kunə mə handay
     cow PL REL 3PL
     ‘their cows …’While the English translations may suggest that na is a copular verb, there are
several pieces of evidence that na is not a verb in Pévé. First, in a verbal clause
the verb immediately follows the subject, while the form na occurs only in
sentence-final position. Second, there is no means of marking na for tense or
aspect, functions that are overtly marked in verbal phrases. Third, the imper-
sonal pronoun na can function as the object of a preposition, a function that
does not apply to verbs:(11) ha tʃì mi ndə́ nə         su?
     2M cry what like I.PRO Q
     ‘The squirrel asked him: Why are you crying like that, friend?’The form na bears resemblance to a number of other grammatical morphemes
in Pévé, including the adposition ne, the masculine determiner and post-
relative marker nə, the proximal determiner ni, and a number of object pro-
nouns in the perfective set. The widespread functions of na and its similarity
to a number of other grammatical morphemes in Pévé provide material for fur-
ther study.","[211, 212, 213]"

         chapter 1The Pévé Language1        IntroductionThe present volume is the first full description of the grammar of Pévé, a Chadic
language spoken in parts of the southwestern area of the Republic of Chad
and the Northern province of the Republic of Cameroon. Data for this volume
were gathered in the course of fieldwork in Cameroon during the summer of
2012 and supplemented by additional data gathered from native speakers. The
present volume also draws on the works of Rodney Venberg, Herrmann Jun-
graithmayr and Michka Sachnine for additional and comparative data (section
3, below).","[11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]"

2        Conditional ConstructionsThe conditional construction in Pévé, as in many languages, describes a certain
state or event (protasis) and the potential outcome or implications of the state
or event (apodosis). The conditional protasis clause, which describes the ini-
tial state or event, is marked by the conditional marker làʔ and by use of the
assertive marker si in clause-final position. The marker làʔ, no doubt derived
from the verb làʔ ‘to say’, may occur immediately before or after the subject of
the protasis, with no apparent distinction. Tense and aspect are marked in the
conditional protasis and apodosis by the same means used in the independent
clause:(1) làʔ      hə́ŋ gí    kwáti ndóʔ si           nambà də̀ ti
    COND 2F make food finish ASSERT 1PL               FUT eat

    2M COND FUT come ASSERT 2M.SBJV hold spear 2M.POSS hand
    ‘If [you] come here, hold your spear (in your hand).’As shown in chapter 9, the assertive marker at the end of a simple sentence indi-
cates that the speaker wants the hearer to believe in the reality of the event or
state described by the sentence. In the conditional construction, the assertive
marker at the end of the protasis clause advises the hearer to believe that the
event or state described in the protasis has occurred, will occur, or may occur.
The use of the assertive marker in the conditional clause is explained by the fact
that consequences expressed in the apodosis will have no bearing if the hearer
does not believe in the truth or reality of the protasis. The consequences of the
protasis are described in the apodosis clause, which has the same form as the
corresponding simple sentence:(5) laʔ        tsoɓ rum         ɓáyrúm si,      i     tsoɓ gaʔ ri məsin

    ‘if you have finished cooking, we will eat’Cf. the simple sentence:(8) nambà də̀ ti
    1PL      FUT eat
    ‘we will eat’As shown in the preceding examples, there is no dedicated marker of the condi-
tional apodosis. There are, however, two types of conditional apodosis clauses:
One that is followed by the assertive marker si and one that is not followed by
the assertive marker. Both are described below.
   When the apodosis involves the auxiliary verb gàk ‘can, be able to’ followed
by another verb, the apodosis is followed by the marker si:(9) na làʔ        mbə́ síi          na gàʔ əm zaʔ si
    na làʔ        mbə́ si           na gàk ùm zàʔ si
    1SG COND come ASSERT 1SG can 3M.O find ASSERT
    ‘If I came here, I could find him.’(10) mum làʔ         gé ndoʔ sin um             si        mum gàk pemãy
     3M COND finish work 3M.POSS ASSERT 3M can rest
     si
     ASSERT
     ‘if he has finished his work, he can rest’ [gé ndoʔ ‘throw end’]The marker si may also follow the apodosis when the protasis describes a
state or event that did not occur. In the next example, evidence that the event
described by the protasis did not occur is provided by use of the counterfactual
(CF) marker kə̀zə́ (see chapter 19) in the protasis clause. This provides evidence
that the assertive marker indicates the speaker’s desire that the hearer accept
an ‘if X, then Y’ connection between the protasis and the apodosis rather than
the speaker’s belief in the real-world state or event:(11) mum làʔ        gbə̀gbóŋ kə̀zə́ ɓáyrúm sí,        kà mum kóra sìnè
     3M COND strong CF much ASSERT then 3M leave field

     DED.M finish arrive ASSERT
     ‘if he were very strong, he would have finished the field earlier’                                                                     Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3

The explanation for this is that use of the future tense indicates the speaker’s
belief that an event or state will occur, so use of the assertive marker would
result in reduplication:(12) handày làʔ        wə́   gí sin wándʒì sí                 handày də̀ ndóʔ
     3PL       COND IMPF do work together ASSERT 3PL                     FUT finish
     ʃìnè rúm         gáʔrí *si
     field 3M.POSS quickly ASSERT
     ‘if they are working together, they will finish their field faster’For the same reason si cannot follow the independent future clause:(13) mum də̀ gewa Garoua síw               *si
     3M FUT return G.             tomorrow *ASSERT
     for ‘he will return from Garoua tomorrow’The assertive marker also does not occur when the apodosis is marked for
another modality, such as obligation or permission. The fact that the assertive
marker does not co-occur with other modality markers adds to the evidence
that si itself is a marker of modality, since markers of different modalities can-
not occur in the same clause. The marker si does not occur when the apodosis
is marked with the clause-initial obligation marker sáy. The following sentence
expresses the speaker’s doubt in the subject’s arrival:(14) mum làʔ         də̀ mbə̀ kətáʔ si sáyʔ na gíláʔ tú
     3M COND FUT come now REL OBLIG 1SG ready body
     rìn-ì           *si
     1SG.POSS-FV ASSERT
     ‘if he comes, I must be ready’The marker si also does not occur when the apodosis clause is marked for the
subjunctive mood, as indicated by use of the subjunctive (SBJV) pronoun (see
chapter 9):(15) la?      hí wə́      də̀ lumo si,           i      dʒi wa
     COND 2PL IMPF go market ASSERT 2PL.SBJV wait head
     rìn         *si
     1SG.POSS ASSERT
     ‘if you (PL) are going to the market, wait for me’
                                                                      Erin Shay - 978-90-04-41005-3
conditional and temporal constructions                                            263   The key components of the conditional construction are thus the con-
ditional marker làʔ preceding or following the subject of the protasis, the
assertive marker si at the end of the protasis, and the stand-alone nature of
the apodosis.","[275, 276, 277, 278, 279]"
