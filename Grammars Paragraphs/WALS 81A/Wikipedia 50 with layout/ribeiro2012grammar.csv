Direct objects, onthe other hand, can be identified by their position and by the circumstance that, whenpronominal, they are obligatorily incorporated into the verb (29). However, when bothsubject and object are nouns, they can only be distinguished by the word order, canonicallySOV:

8.3.1   Possession and lexical classes        Possessed nouns are preceded by their possessors (34a, 35a). Pronominal possessionis indicated by prefixes, which coincide in part with those occurring as direct objects(incorporated into the verb) or objects of postpositions. Most noun and verb stems can bedivided into two lexical classes, which I will label i-class and Î-class, after the third-personprefixes taken by nouns in each class. As illustrated below by the paradigms for kOrU‘forehead’ (34) and EbO ‘hand’ (35), the differences are not limited to the third person.","[51, 52]"
"However, the verb in the following sentence, raao)bidad´)èkreèb´) ‘in order to fight,’ presentscentrifugal marking.",[197]
"Since most languages presenting [ATR] vowel harmony are genetically or areally related, theKarajá case provides a different perspective for the typological understanding of thephenomenon (Ribeiro 2002). Once again, the chapter does not provide the final word on thesubject, indicating instead additional topics for investigation; for instance, a thoroughaccoustic analysis of the vowel inventory is yet to be conducted, in order to investigatewhether the mechanisms underlying [ATR] distinctions in Karajá are similar to those foundin better-known languages.",[137]

6. Final remarks       This chapter described the morphology of Karajá, focusing especially on theinflectional and derivational properties of nouns and verbs. A thorough description of verband noun morphology makes it possible to determine the morphosyntactic position of‘descriptives’, i.e. lexemes that denote adjectival meanings. Contrary to previous analyses(Fortune 1973, Maia 1986), the description provided here demonstrates that descriptives arein fact nouns. A conclusive proof of their nominal nature is the fact that, in order to be usedas a descriptive word, a verb must be first nominalized, which is particularly clear in casesfor which nominalization is indicated by consonantal replacement.","[231, 232]"
"The minimal phonological word in Karajá must be bimoraic. In order to satisfy suchconstraint, an underlyingly monosyllabic root must, when pronounced by itself, duplicate itsvowel: bE ‘water’ [bE""E], wa ‘pé’ [wa""a], tSu ‘sun’ [tSu""u]. CCV-words behave, as one wouldexpect, as bimoraic. As we will see (Chapter 2), CCV syllables also behave phonologicallyas bimoraic units in processes such as reduplication and hypocoristic shortening.",[41]
"        The case of Karajá (as well as a brief observation of other languages of the stock)suggests that one must be cautious in analyzing descriptive predicates as verbs in Macro-Jê
                                                 212
languages. In cases in which there are clear criteria to distinguish nouns and verbs,descriptive predicates tend to behave mostly like nouns. For example, in Karajá a verb mustfirst be nominalized in order to appear in a descriptive predicate. Consequently, one mustalso be cautious in relying on the behavior of descriptive predicates as a sole criterion topropose active-stative systems.","[223, 224]"
"       The iambic nature of stress assignment in Karajá is especially clear withmorphologically complex words. Notice that, in compounds, the original stress pattern of theindividual stems is ‘rearranged’ in order to follow the iambic pattern. One can assume that,although stems can be said to carry stress, the position of such stress is not underlyinglypredetermined. Although the stress is, by default, assigned to the last syllable of a stem, itsultimate position will depend on the morphological or syntactic position of the stem. That isillustrated below by a compound (5a), a case of derivational suffixation (6b), and by avocative phrase involving the vocative interjection, which is stressed (7b). The behavior ofthe stress if further illustrated in (8) and (9), which show stress (re-)assignment undersuffixation (8b) and compounding (9b). As shown in (9c), a possessive phrase such asbrOrE-d¸) hUk´)-TÈ ‘cow’s milk’ can be pronounced as two words (in which case both preservetheir primary stress) or as a single phonological word.",[88]
"8.3 Morphosyntax       Karajá is an SOV, head-marking language. Core NP arguments—that is, subject anddirect object—are not morphologically marked. Pronominal subjects are expressed by aseries of free pronouns, such as ♀ dIkar´) ‘I’ in (28) below, while pronominal objects are
                                                37
expressed by a series of bound morphemes, such as wa- ‘1st person’ in (29). In contrast to afairly simple nominal morphology, Karajá presents a complex verb morphology, beingtraditionally described as having a very irregular fused set of prefixes indicating person,aspect, object, and direction (Fortune & Fortune 1964, Wiesemann 1986, Maia 1998).","[48, 49]"
"8. Final remarks       Karajá presents a pervasive and straightforward mechanism to create subordinate clauses,shared by relative, complement, and ‘adverbial’ clauses alike. This device is clausenominalization: an entire clause is nominalized and, as such, can occur in all the positionstraditionally occupied by noun phrases (including subject and direct objects, objects ofpostpositions, and noun modifiers). Clause nominalization (a syntactic process) differs fromlexical nominalization (a morphological process) in a number of ways, the main one beingthat the former preserves all the inflectional properties of the verb. With subordinate clausesoccuring in the position of a bare nominal (that is, a noun phrase not followed by
28
     Notice that in both nominalizing suffixes, -dV and -TV, ‘V’ is a copy of the last vowel in the verb stem.",[271]
"       Such an analysis is particularly appealing if one takes into consideration extendedintransitive verbs, which, as we have seen, take non-canonically marked objects. That is thecase of the verb -ehu ‘to throw’, whose objects are marked with the instrumental postpositionèdI (48a). While, with transitive verbs, the original object cannot be expressed undercausativization, with extended intransitive verbs the original object is preserved with itsoriginal marking, and the original subject (the causée) is expressed as a direct object (48b):(48)   a.      kUladU m´nadI          rehure                                    bOdOIdI

                                               204
        The main argument for treating causativization as a case of noun incorporation à laSadock (i.e., a case of syntactic word-formation) is the fact that the original verb root seemsto preserve some syntactic saliency, still assigning case to its original, non-canonicallymarked object.","[215, 216]"
"        Purpose clauses are constructed with the postposition èb´) attached to verbs in thefuture or potential. This is probably an extension of the use of this postposition to indicatedestination (see 2.6 above).20(55)    i-ha)wÈÈèO idZoi           a-r-a-dÈèk´re

5.1.1. Nominal imperatives        A common type of negative imperative is formed with an action noun followed by thepostposition èb´) and, optionally, either the future marker èkre or the potential marker èkE.2120
   The use of destination adpositions to mark purpose clauses is commonly attested, as in English (I came to see
you) and Portuguese (eu vim para vê-lo).

   Notice that the future and potential markers are also optional in verbal imperatives.",[255]
"6.3 Interactions between vowel harmony and palatalization           As we have seen, palatalization is clearly a lexical process in Karajá, whereas vowelharmony is likely a post-lexical one, occuring across word-boundaries; vowel harmony andpalatalization would be, in traditional terms, in counter-feeding order. There are, however, atleast two cases in which vowel harmony clearly feeds palatalization. These can be seen asold compounds, which are not synchronically perceived as such. One is the kinship terma)dZikura ‘mother’s older sister’, which results probably from the combination of themorphemes a)dI ‘mother’ and kura ‘white’41 (compare it with waha ‘my father’ versuswahakura ‘my father’s older brother’). In this case, the high [+ATR] vowel /u/ triggersvowel harmony in the [-ATR] vowel of the preceding root, which then triggers palatalizationon the voiced stop /d/, as shown by the derivation given below:(96)       input                      /adI-kura/
           vowel harmony              adikura
           palatalization             adZikura
           output                     [adZiku'ra]41
     For a discussion of the use of color terms in Karajá kinship terminology, see Donahue (1982:158).",[134]
"Notice that the root triggers vowel harmony in the preceding [-ATR] vowels.(95)   a.      r-E-Î-uri-d´)èr-a                               [reÎu""rin´)ra]

           A likely explanation would be that uri underlyingly contains a [-ATR] vowel in itsfirst syllable: /Uri/. The surface [+ATR] quality of its first vowel would be a consequence ofvowel harmony triggered by the [+ATR] vowel occurring in its last syllable. The rules ofvowel harmony and palatalization would be in a counter-feeding order. The initial vowelmay very well have been a fossilized intransitive marker, U-, attested with other stems (seeChapter 4).","[133, 134]"
"This lack of explicit indication of which position is relativized may lead to ambiguity whenone has a third-person transitive verb with a third-person object. Thus, in both examplesbelow, the relativized position may be interpreted as being either the subject or the directobject of the subordinate clause:(34)   ♂       ha)wÈÈèb´) r-a-∅-bièr-a

          Subject and direct objects are the positions which tend to be more easily relativizablecross-linguistically, when compared with other syntactic positions. The hierarchy of whichpositions are more likely to allow relativization is thus summarized by Keenan and Comrie(1977):(36)      Keenan and Comrie’s (1977) Accessibility Hierarchy:
          Subject > Direct Object > Indirect Object > Object of Adposition > Possessor
          While subject and direct object relativized positions are not marked in Karajá,relativized positions occupying a lower position in the accessibility hierarchy are marked bya third-person pronominal form. That is, relativization of any syntactic position besidessubject and direct object is accomplished through pronoun retaining strategies. This is thecase for objects of all the postpositions (including the dative, which behaves as any otheroblique NP in the language, and objects of comparison), as well as possessors. Below areexamples of relativized locative (37), ablative (38), and genitive (39) positions:(37)      kai      ha)waèr´bI     Î-∅-∅-EhEb´)-d´)èÎ-ErI

       The example below further illustrates a pronoun-retaining relative clause, involvingthe object of the verb -ehu ‘to throw, to shoot’, which is marked with the instrumentalposposition èdI. Notice that the clitic èle ‘only’, which generally attaches to the right edgeof a noun phrase, occurs after the subordinate verb:(40)   biuraèO          i-dI           ∅-r-∅-ehuèr-aèle

       ‘Only the one [the wax-tipped arrow] he had shot towards east was melted.’
3.3 Possible origins of the ‘subordinating accent’       As we have seen, stress shift plays an important role in subordination in Karajá. Thisdevice—which we may call ‘subordinating accent’—is reminiscent of the ‘definite accent’ inTonga, described by Anderson (1992: 212) as an example of non-affixal clitic. In thislanguage, according to Anderson, “the normal location of stress is on (the syllablecontaining) the penultimate mora. A sort of definiteness is marked by a stress shift to thefinal mora of the entire NP.” In this case, the stress shift is explained as being the reflex of ademonstrative morpheme *a which would have existed diachronically.","[246, 247, 248]"
"       Chapter 3 describes the language’s word-formation strategies, including, in additionto morphology proper (that is, the combination of roots and affixes), the use of particles andclitics. Verb morphology is where most of Karajá’s grammatical complexity lies: the verbinflects for person (with portmanteau morphemes which also indicate mood), direction(which also play evidential functions), and voice (transitive, passive, and antipassive),besides incorporating object pronouns and nouns (sometimes with classificatory purposes).",[81]

        Complement clauses are those which occupy the position of a noun phrase, occuringas arguments of the verb or as objects of postpositions. Like relative clauses, complementclauses in Karajá are also characterized by stress shift. In (43) below, the subordinate clauseis the subject of the main clause, whereas in (44), the subordinate clause is the object of theverb ♀ kErÈ, ♂ ErÈ ‘to know’.(43)    a-rÈbEèr-e                      idZa""TO        k´-d-∅-OhOd´)èk´re!

                                          CHAPTER 4
                                          Morphology1. Introduction
         This chapter describes Karajá’s word-formation strategies, including, in addition tomorphology proper (that is, the combination of roots and affixes), the use of particles andclitics. Most of the chapter will be devoted to verb morphology, which is where most ofKarajá’s grammatical complexity lies: the verb inflects for person (with portmanteaumorphemes which also indicate mood), direction (which also play evidential functions), andvoice (transitive, passive, and antipassive), besides incorporating object pronouns and nouns(sometimes with classificatory purposes). Tense and aspect are conveyed by clitics andparticles, respectively. As in many other lowland South American languages, nouns,postpositions, and (to a lesser extent) verbs share person-marking paradigms. Sincepostpositions have already been described in Chapter 1, and their semantic and syntacticcharacteristics will be further discussed in Chapter 5, they will not be dealt with in thischapter. Section 2 describes the inflectional properties of verbs. Section 3 deals with theinflectional properties of nouns and briefly discusses the small class of personal pronouns,outlining their main differences in relation to nouns. Section 4 discusses derivationalmorphology, describing processes used to create new noun (Section 4.1) and verb (4.2)stems.","[182, 183]"
"However, a more careful analysis reveals a rather regular, mostly agglutinating morphology,with separate prefixes indicating person (and cumulatively, mood), direction, and valence(28). In addition, pronominal direct objects are obligatorily incorporated into the verb (29).(28)    ♀        dIkar´) waha            ka-r-I-rakOèk´re
                                   12

                 ‘My father will wait for me.’
        Nominals functioning as subjects and direct objects are not morphologically marked,but there is a clear-cut distinction between subject pronouns and non-subject pronouns.",[49]
"A case in point is the noun b´dE ‘time, ground, world’, which occurs in a number ofidiomatic expressions as an ‘empty’ object (b´dE + rÈrÈ ‘remember’ > ‘to become sad’; b´dE+ buka ‘disagree; not fit’ > ‘to be unlucky, when fishing, hunting, etc.’; b´dE + kErÈ ‘toknow’ > ‘to realize’). This word also occurs in non-idiomatic constructions, as the subject of‘atmospheric’ verbs (‘to cool down’, ‘to become silent’, ‘to become dark’, etc.) or as anobject. In its more idiomatic uses, b´dE can cliticize to the verb or even be incorporated intoit; as the examples below demonstrate, vowel harmony triggered by the first vowel in theverb root buka extends all the way to the object b´dE (78). Vowel harmony between the verband its object is further illustrated by (79), a curse, where the clitic èr-e ‘imperfective’triggers vowel harmony throughout the verb, reaching the object ruE ‘eye’.(78)   a.      waha            b´dE    ∅-r-I-bukaèra [b´deribu""kara]

6.1.3 Vowel harmony and grammatical function           As metaphony in Portuguese (which serves to distinguish nouns from verbs, andsecondarily reinforces gender and number distinctions), vowel harmony in Karajá (or its lackthereof) may play a role in grammatical distinctions. Although a finite verb in Karajágenerally ends with an aspectual-modal clitic, such a clitic may be suppressed in casualspeech. As we have seen, two of the aspectual-modal clitics, èkre ‘future’ and èr-e‘imperfective’, can trigger vowel harmony. The latter, by far the most frequent aspectual-modal clitic, can be suppressed while still triggering vowel harmony (80)—a case ofassimilation in absentia, as I mentioned elsewhere (Ribeiro 2005:103). Vowel harmony maybe, in such cases, the sole mark of aspect. On the other hand, the lack of vowel harmony is,to a certain extent, a mark of aspect as well, in examples such as (81) and (82) below; the factthat such examples do not display vowel harmony is in itself an indication, by exclusion, thatsuch verbs are not imperfective (marked by the harmony-triggering clitic èr-e) or future(marked by èkre).(80)       bEraètSi      ∅-r-E-TEè∅        [re""Te]

           Although the antipassive was not described by previous authors, it is commonlyfound in both narrative and descriptive texts, commonly being used in contexts such as theone above, in which an antipassive form of the verb is later followed by a transitive one,specifying the object.

       Noun incorporation in Karajá is a process by which the head of the absolutive nounphrase is inserted into the verb, thereby forming a compound. The more productive pattern ofnoun incorporation involves only possessed nouns—that is, productive noun incorporation inKarajá is a possessor-raising strategy. Since only the head of the absolutive noun phrase isincorporated, the valence of the resulting noun-verb compound remains unaltered, as the                                               198

8.13 Numerals       Karajá has numeral words (or constructions) for the concepts ‘one’ to ‘twenty’. Fornumerals ‘one’ to ‘five’, there are single words (81). Some of these numerals seem to bemade up of more than one identifiable, albeit fossilized, morpheme, including third personprefix i-, bIkOwa ‘companion’, èdo) ‘indefinite article’ (as suggested by stress and itsbehavior in male speech), and kÈre ‘half’. The use of words such as ‘companion’ with thenumeral ‘four’ is also found in other lowland South American languages (Green 1997), andcould be an areal phenomenon.

        The system of directional markers in Karajá presents characteristics that traditionallydefine an inflectional category, such as obligatoriness, semantic and formal regularity, andproductivity (Anderson 1985:163; Bauer 1988:73-87; Bybee 1985:11). The existence ofdirection as an inflectional category seems to be a fairly rare phenomenon. Talmy(1985:135), for example, in a survey of grammatical categories, states categorically thatdirection “is not marked inflectionally.” According to Bybee, this would be due to its lack oflexical generality:      By definition, an inflectional category must be applicable to all stems of the appropriate semantic
      and syntactic category and must obligatorily occur in the appropriate syntactic context. In order
      for a morphological process to be so general, it must have only minimal semantic content. If a
      semantic element has high content, i.e. is very specific, it simply will not be applicable to a large
      number of stems. [Bybee 1985:16-17]
      That is, since the category of direction would in principle be relevant only for motionverbs, it would not apply to a sufficient number of verbs to constitute an inflectionalcategory. Thus, besides being commonly expressed lexically such as in Portuguese levar ‘totake away’ versus trazer ‘to bring’ and English come versus go, and by clitics, direction isalso found expressed derivationally, such as in Latin eo¤ ‘I go’, ex-eo¤ ‘I go out’, trans-eo¤ ‘I goacross.’ However, as Bybee (op. cit., 17) observes, “each of these prefixes has a limited                                                      175
lexical applicability, for they are only appropriately added to verbs indicating motion of somesort. Their semantic content prevents them from meeting one of the criteria for inflectionalstatus.”","[185, 186, 187]"
"5. Descriptive words        A number of Macro-Jê languages—including Karajá--are traditionally described aspresenting an active-stative verb agreement system to some degree. According to Fortune &Fortune (1964) and Maia (1998), Karajá verbs are divided into two different classes, activeand stative, with the latter consisting essentially of predicates which denote adjectivalmeanings, the so-called ‘descriptive verbs.’ These predicates take a series of person markerswhich partially coincides with the pronominal object markers in transitive verbs, and whichhappens to be the same series of possessive prefixes occurring with nouns. A more carefulexamination, however, demonstrates that such ‘verbs’ are, in fact, nouns, and that transitivity,rather than stativity, plays a central role in Karajá grammar.",[223]

       With a few extended intransitive verbs which take an allative or dative argument,such as ´)k´)raSi ‘to ask’, transitivization results in the promotion of the former obliqueargument to direct object (examples from the Xambioá dialect):(28)   a.      hawÈkÈ          ÎarikOrEkO               r´)k´)raSire

2.3.2 Transitive verbs       Transitive verbs are those that take a direct object as one of their arguments. InKarajá, transitive verbs are always marked by the prefix I-, as shown by the paradigms givenin (7) above. As mentioned above (Section 2.2), transitive and intransitive valence prefixesmay fuse with the preceding personal prefix under certain circumstances, such as in the 2ndperson in the centrifugal direction of the realis mood (29a). Notice that there is no fusion inthe centripetal direction (29b).(29)   a.      ÎErakoÎe                          b.     ÎadIrakoÎe

2.3.2.1 Reflexive
                                                 193
       There are two allomorphs of the reflexive morpheme, eSi- and iSi-. The former isincorporated into the verb, when the NP coreferential with the subject is a direct object (30a).","[203, 204, 205]"
"Plurality in the verb is marked by the auxiliary -Ed´), which presents the same inflectionalproperties of the temporal-aspectual auxiliaries mentioned above. Although it agrees onlywith the subject, the auxiliary -Ed´) can express the plurality of the subject, the object, or

8.10    Postpositions        There are at least eleven postpositions in Karajá (Table 14). Except for the reflexive(marked by the prefix iSi-), postpositions generally take the same series of prefixes as i-classstems (listed in Table 4 above). The only exception is the postposition b´), which takes theprefix U- in the second person (the only occurrence of this prefix whatsoever). Somepostpositions present suppletive pronominal forms corresponding to the third person. Mostof the postpositions are unstressed, with the exception of the dative d´kE and the the evitativelaku.","[71, 72]"
"       Analyzing èdokuri as a speech act clitic helps us to understand the differencesbetween dokuri-clauses and the reason clauses described above: dokuri-clauses are probablyexamples of speech act adverbial clauses, whose function, as defined by Thompson &Longacre (1985:203) “is not to modify or qualify the main clause in any way, but to modifyor qualify, as it were, the speech act which the speaker is performing in uttering the mainclause.” In fact, most attitude markers can be seen as speech-act subordinators to a certainextent, since they anchor the utterance to a previous one; in an example such as (83) below,the attitude markers èTOE ‘enthusiasm’ and èT´) ‘repetition’ can only be interpreted inreference to a previous speech act (it was jokingly said as a warning to a child who insisted inclimbing a tree against a parent’s repeated admoestation):(83)   b´-d-∅-UrUèkreèTOEèT´)

7. Nominalized complements       Corresponding roughly to the subordinate clauses described above, one commonlyfinds nominalized forms of the verbs playing the role of complements. Deverbal nouns maybe preceded by a grammatical possessor which corresponds to the original absolutiveargument of the verb—that is, to the subject of an intransitive verb, such as in wa-rira ‘mywalking’ (from ♀ rika ~ ritSa ‘to walk’), or to the object of a transitive verb, such as in
kOÎUd¸) b´)d´) ‘turtle catching.’ (from b´) ‘to catch’). These constructions occur in any of thefunctions performed by subordinate clauses (or by any NP, for that matter)—that is, assubjects (84), direct objects (85) or objects of postpositions (86-91):(84)   ♀       ir´      ÎaraTa      ∅-r-I-wa-d-EkÈw´TE-d´)èr-a

In addition, the suffix -dU forms subject nouns (that is, nouns refering to the subject of theoriginal verb), which can be translated as relative clauses (92). The suffix -da), on the otherhand, forms nouns which name instruments, places, or other circumstances related to theaction denoted by the verb (r´T´)-da) ‘food’ < r´T´) ‘to eat’; kOra-da) ‘shredder’ < kOka ‘toshred’; TUrO-da) ‘soap (or any washing device)’ < TUhO ‘to wash’).(92)    r´T´)-da)    wÈdÈ-dU               ∅-r-∅-OrOèr-ErI

  Both ÎEhE ‘to watch, to look at’ and ehu ‘to throw’ take objects marked by the instrumental postposition èdI
(corresponding to what would be direct objects in English or Portuguese). The ‘ball game’ [lit. ‘the throwing of
the ball’] in the example above refers, naturally, to soccer.","[267, 268, 269]"
"       Since Karajá is an SOV language and the object tends to form a prosodic unit with theverb, vowel harmony can take place between the verb and the object. Considerations offrequency seems to play a role in predicting whether vowel harmony will take place. Thatseems to be especially common with idiomatic and formulaic constructions (such as curses).",[125]

3.1 Internal versus external relative clauses        Another important distinction is between internal and external relative clauses,according to the location of the domain noun (whether inside or outside the relative clause,respectively; Keenan 1985:143). In all the examples given so far, the domain nouns areinside the relative clauses. However, examples in which the domain noun is outside therelative clause are also easily attested (32).(32)    kai     r´T´)da)

When an oblique domain noun is separated from the relative clause, notice that thepostposition marking the oblique NP occurs twice—with both the domain noun and thesubordinate clause. That is, the stranded relative clause agrees in case with the domain noun:(33)    iwErUèb´)    r-E-o)èr-a                              ∅-a)dI

3.2 Pronoun retaining strategies       In the previous sections, we concentrate on the syntactic properties of the domainnouns. In this section, attention will be given to the relativized position—that is, the positionin the relative clause which is co-referential with the domain noun. In all the examples ofrelative clauses presented so far, the relativized position corresponds to a core argument ofthe subordinate clause—either the subject, as in (32), or the direct object, as in (33). As theseexamples show, there is no surface indication of which position is relativized, which isindicated by gapping—that is, the relativized NP is simply absent from the relative clause.","[244, 245, 246]"
"Fortune and Fortune (1975: 115-6) also mention two other cases in which “the men’s speechform is totally different from the women’s”—the verbs ‘to cry’ and (in my translation) ‘tobecome angry’. This is clearly a mistake. The roots obu and hi ‘to cry’ and TIra and EbUrE‘to become angry’ are used in both female and male speech to refer to processes happening tofemale and male subjects, respectively—a difference having no relation with the femaleversus male speech distinctions with which this chapter is concerned.12 Similar examples arefound in Yana, according to Sapir’s (1949) description:
11
   In Javaé, as we will see, only the male forms of the words containing the morphemes ado) and do) were
preserved: ao)da ‘thing’, hirarièo) ‘a girl’ etc. However, the loanword for ‘pineapple’ in Javaé maintains the
original [n] in both male and female speech: ado)da). This example suggests that the drift towards male speech
(if there was indeed one; see Section 6) was already consolidated by the time this loanword entered the
language (cf. section 4).
12
   Similar mistakes were made by Ehrenreich (1894), in a time when knowledge of Portuguese among the
Karajá was probably very rare, making communication between outsiders and the Karajá a challenging
endeavor. He listed as male-female speech variants words that actually have different meanings, and are
common to both varieties. That is the case of the words watSiwi ‘cooking pot’ and b´TE ‘plate’, listed by
Ehrenreich as the male- and female-speech forms for ‘pot’, respectively (Ehrenreich 1894:23).",[152]
"       The basic mechanism to signal subordination, as illustrated by relative andcomplement clauses in subject and direct object positions, is stress shift, an interestingexample of non-concatenative morphology. As we have seen, a typical finite verb in Karajápresents tense-aspect clitics, which are unstressed. In independent clauses, the stress fallsordinarily on the last syllable of the verb stem (1). In relative clauses, however, the stressshifts to the tense-aspect clitic (2). The entire subordinate clause behaves as a noun phrase,and, as such, may take nominal clitics such as the indefinite article (3) ♀ èdo) (♂ èo)) (and, as
we will see, postpositions):(1)    Îori ∅-d-∅-OrOèd-e          [do""rode]

       Considering the role they play in signaling adverbial subordination, postpositions willalso be described in this chapter (Section 2). Section 3 will be dedicated to the description ofthe properties of relative clauses, providing a background for the discussion of complementclauses (Section 4) and postpostional clauses (Section 5), which in Karajá play most of thefunctions traditionally associated with adverbial clauses. Section 6 describes nominalizedcomplements. Section 7 deals with èdokuri clauses, a case of speech act adverbialsubordination. Section 8 provides a summary of the chapter.","[233, 234]"

As I mentioned above, bothtransitive and intransitive valence prefixes may fuse with the preceding personal prefix undercertain circumstances, such as in the 2nd person in the centrifugal direction of the realis mood(55a). Notice that there is no fusion in the centripetal direction (55b).(55)   a.      ÎErakoÎe                        b.      ÎadIrakoÎe
               Îa-∅-I-∅-rakOèÎ-e                       Îa-d-I-∅-rakOèÎ-e
               2-CTFG-TRANS-3-wait=2-IMPERF            2-CTPT-TRANS-3-wait=2-IMPERF
               ‘You waited for him (thither).’         ‘You waited for him (hither).’
8.3.5.2.1 Reflexive       There are two allomorphs of the reflexive morpheme, eSi- and iSi-. The former isincorporated into the verb, when the NP co-referential with the subject is a direct object (56a).","[61, 62, 63]"
"As we will see (Chapter 6), this prefix has likely cognates in Jê and other Macro-Jê families.(36)    a.       ha)bu l-´bU       ‘the man’s blood’
        b.       ha)-l-´bU         ‘blood’
        c.       wa-l-´bU          ‘my blood’
        d.       ∅-´bU             ‘your blood’
        e.       Î-´bU             ‘his blood’
        The distinction between both lexical classes pervades the entire morphology of thelanguage. With verbs, the main difference between both classes is in the fact that Î-classintransitive verbs, such as uÎǨÎǨ ‘to become cold’, are marked by a zero prefix, whereas
i-class intransitive verbs, such as ÎOÎ´kE ‘to become hot’, are marked by the prefix a-:(37)    a.       b´dE          ∅-r-∅-uÎǨÎǨèr-a
                 weather       3-CTFG-INTR-become.cold=CTFG-PERF
                 ‘The weather got cold.’        b.       b´dE          ∅-r-a-ÎOÎ´kEèr-a
                 weather       3-CTFG-INTR-become.hot=CTFG-PERF
                 ‘The weather got hot.’
        Î-class transitive stems, such as UahId´) ‘to treat’14, take the prefix Î- when notimmediately preceded by a pronominal direct object or by an incorporated noun (38a). Whenimmediately preceded by a pronominal direct object or an incorporated noun, the relationalprefix l- is used (38b):14
  This is a denominal verb derived from -UahI ‘medicine’. It is tempting to consider the prefix Î- occurring
with transitive verbs as simply a marker of 3rd person object. However, this prefix also occurs with antipassive
constructions (54), which do not allow explicit direct objects.",[54]

       Thus, there is a strong tendency to assign the role of deictic center to the most salientcharacter or location, and not necessarily to the character or location which is physicallycloser to the speaker. The same tendency is manifested in other, longer texts, such as in thetext ‘Krysa-my Ijyy,’ which tells the story of a war occurred between the Karajá and theXavante, their traditional enemies. The text was narrated by a Karajá man in the samevillage where some of the narrated events took place. Most of the story is about anexpedition of Karajá warriors to Xavante territory in order to revenge the killing of a Karajáyouth. The Karajá village is initially presented as the deictic center. At a certain point, theKarajá men ask for the help of Bandeira, a White man, who lends them firearms. Thisfragment of the text is reproduced below (17). Notice that the narrator adopts Bandeira’sviewpoint (dOIdEd´)ède ‘they came’) and not the viewpoint of the Karajá men. This reflectsthe more central role played by Bandeira, the man who has the firearms, at this point of thenarrative.","[194, 195, 196]"

       According to Fortune & Fortune (1964) and Maia (1998), Karajá verbs would bedivided into two different classes, active and stative, with the latter consisting essentially ofpredicates denoting adjectival meanings, the so-called ‘descriptive verbs.’ Descriptivepredicates take exactly the same series of person markers taken by nouns (Table 11), asshown by the examples below:(47)   a.      wa-d-EbUrEèr-e             b.           ∅-EbUrEèÎ-e

       As we have seen, pronominal direct objects are obligatorily incorporated into theverb. The series of direct object prefixes is partially the same that occurs with nouns anddescriptive predicates:(49)   a.      Î´kI ∅-r-I-wa-rakOèk´re

         Person agreement displays a strictly nominative pattern, with the verb alwaysagreeing with the subject, be it intransitive (2a) or transitive (2b). Person agreement markersare distributed into two different sets, one occurring in the realis (present and past tenses) andthe other in the irrealis (future, potential, and admonitory). These prefixes are listed in Table1 below.32Table 4.1. Subject agreement markers in Karajá

In Karajá, such adistinction is completely dependent on the morphological mechanisms that are madeavailable by the language. Thus, in the examples below, the prefix r- indicates that the eventis seen as occurring away from the current location of the speaker (centrifugal direction),32
   The same set of prefixes is used for singular and plural. There is also a distinction between a first person
plural exclusive (marked by the same set of prefixes used for first person singular) and a first person plural
inclusive (inflected for third person). The prefix k´- ‘3rd person’ is restricted to the centripetal direction of the
irrealis mood.","[184, 185]"

  These semantic characterizations are approximations. For the concepts of figure and path adopted here, see
Talmy (1985:129), who defines figure as “the salient moving or stationary object in a motion event” and path as
a category which “refers to the variety of paths followed, or sites occupied, by the Figure object.”

  Although the range of meanings displayed by some of the Karajá pospositions may at first seem unusual, it is
very easy to find parallels in other, well-known languages such as English or Portuguese. The use of locative
postpositions with temporal purposes (as a metaphorical extension from location in space to location in time),
                                                     226
name, think and tell (that is, the complements denoting that which is said, heard, thought,asked, or told) are also marked by the postposition èb´) (15). As we will see, this semanticdiversity accounts for the use of this postposition to mark both purpose clauses and converbs,as well as sentential complements of verbs such as say, tell, etc.6(11)     ♂        wa-oworuèb´)          a-r-∅-aèkre

                  ‘My friends call me Kawina.’for example, is a rather common phenomenon. Even more idiosyncratic uses of postpositions (as non-canonical
markers of what would be translated as direct objects in English) may also reflect cross-linguistic tendencies.
As Jespersen (1965:159) points out, verbs for ‘to throw’ take objects marked as instrumentals in many
languages, including Old Norse. The use of a locative posposition to mark the object of a verb such as ♀ rakuSi
‘to eat’ (♂ roSi) is paralleled in English by the use of on in constructions such as deer feed on grass or the
castaway lived on coconuts for weeks.

  This apparent diversity of meanings could be due not to polysemy, but to homophony (that is, instead of these
being instances of different meanings associated with a single postposition, it could be the case that there would
be different postpositions with the same phonological shape). However, the fact that a postposition such as èb´)

       Passive verbs are marked by the prefix a-, with class I stems such as TUhO ‘to wash’(57b), or its zero allomorph, with class II stems, such as -uka ‘to split’ (57b). Notice that thisis apparently the same prefix that occurs with basic intransitive verbs such as rika I ‘to walk’and -obi ‘to see’. With transitive roots, however, this prefix will always convey a passive oranticausative meaning.(57)   a.      d-a)dI        wa-Î´kÈ      ∅-r-I-TUhOèr-ErI

       In the passive construction, the original O becomes the subject, as in languages suchas English, for example. However, unlike English, where the agent in a passive constructioncan be expressed as an oblique (‘by-phrase’), in Karajá the agent, although sometimesimplicit, cannot be expressed at all. Thus, passives in Karajá are both a backgroundingconstruction, functioning to delete unknown or irrelevant subjects, and a foregroundingconstruction, since it results in the promotion of the original O to subject position (Foley andVan Valin 1985).","[63, 64]"
"         Karajá, like most (if not all) Macro-Jê languages, lacks adjectives as an independentpart of speech. In languages lacking adjectives, their functions tend to be expressed by nounsor verbs. The tendency, in Macro-Jê studies, has been to describe ‘descriptives’ (i.e., wordsexpressing adjectival functions) as verbs, an interpretation which has also been proposed for

       In addition to the paradigmatic peculiarities and wide range of semantic uses, the‘diffuse locative’ postposition, èb´), presents some distributional peculiarities. As illustratedby (16) below, in which èb´) occurs as a purpose marker, it can follow other postpositions (inthis case, the ‘static locative’ èkI). [The example also illustrates the use of the dativepostposition, èd´kE ~ èdEE, with benefactive functions.](16)   wa-dEE              kIè

       ‘Watch out for me!’ (lit. ‘[It is] for [it to be] in your eyes for me.’)       Another characteristic which sets èb´) apart from all the remaining postpositions is itsposition with relation to the contrastive morpheme èle ‘only’: while èle follows all the otherpostpositions, as illustrated below by the dative èd´kE (17a), it precedes èb´) (17b):(17)   a.              kEè

2.1 Extended intransitive verbs       A number of verbs which would be translated as transitives in English or Portuguesehave objects marked by oblique postpositions in Karajá. For example, the verb -obi ‘to see’takes objects marked by the locative postposition èb´) (18); -ehu ‘to throw’ takes
                                                228
complements marked by the instrumental postposition èdI (19); -aha ‘to find’ takescomplements marked by the locative postpositions ètSi or èkI (20).7 The verb ♀ rakuSi ‘to
eat’ (♂ roSi), although marked by the prefix I-, which generally occurs with transitive verbs,
takes objects marked by the posposition èb´) (21).8(18)       kai    wa--b´)              Îa-d-obièÎ-e

2.6.1 Incorporation of b´dE ‘world, time’         In addition to the incorporation of body-part terms, which does not alter a verb’svalence, a less common type involves the incorporation of the noun b´dE ‘world, time’,which occurs as a direct object in idiomatic constructions such as the ones in (42) and (43)below. Examples such as these are the only case in which noun incorporation results invalence change, turning transitive verbs into intransitive ones.(42)     a.       baÎUkari          b´dE

  These examples may suggest, at the first sight, the existence of double incorporation (first of TIra, followed
by the incorporation of OÎI). It is more likely, however, that OÎI-TIra is a compound, in which case
incorporation would have taken place only once.","[211, 212]"
"       Predicative and attributive adjectives are among the lesser known aspects of Macro-Jêlanguages. According to the descriptions available, in all Macro-Jê languages the ‘adjective’would follow the noun (Rodrigues 1999: 193). Since most Macro-Jê languages are SOV, theposition of the adjective in these languages would constitute a systematic counter-example toGreenberg’s implicational universals, according to which adjectives would tend to precedethe modified noun in SOV languages (Greenberg 1966). However, since most suchdescriptions do not give clear evidence for the existence of adjectives as an independent partof speech, the apparently exceptional nature of adjectives in Macro-Jê may well be justanother undesirable result of what one might call ‘translation-based linguistic analysis.’       That is certainly the case of Karajá, also traditionally described as having postposedadjectives (Maia 1998: 32). However, a careful analysis of the Karajá data clearlydemonstrates that words denoting adjectival meanings in this language are abstract nounswhose behavior is identical to that of obligatorily possessed nouns—i.e., corresponding toattributive constructions such as the angry man, Karajá presents a genitive construction, theman’s anger. This implies that, instead of occurring as a modifier, the “adjectival” wordwould be, in fact, the head of the noun phrase, a phenomenon documented in languages suchas Aleut (Sadock 2000), but commonly overlooked when considering Lowland SouthAmerican languages.",[224]
"        The study of some morphophonemic alternations also corroborates the analysissuggested above. Thus, the nominalizer suffix -TV (where V stands for a vowel identical tothe last vowel in the verb root) is palatalized when attached to a verb root ending in the highfront [+ATR] vowel /i/, but not after its [-ATR] counterpart /I/:(21)    Verb              Noun
        -aha              -aha-Ta           ‘find’
        -UO               -uO-TO            ‘fly’
        -l´dI             -l´dI-TI          ‘put’
        -obi              -obi-Si           ‘see’
        The same can be postulated for the remaining palatal consonants, the affricates /tS/and /dZ/. As the examples below show, they also occur generally in contiguity to high[+ATR] vowels.11 Notice the contrast with the [-ATR] high vowels /U/, /È/, and /I/, whichoccur with non-palatal consonants:(22)    butSi             ‘clay pot’              kOÎI       ‘tobacco’

"       As we have seen, the only surface difference between the independent clause in (1)and its subordinate counterpart in (2) is in the location of the stress: [Îo""ri do""rode] ‘the White

In fact, stressshift is the basic mechanism to mark the subordinate status of relative clauses that modifycore NPs (that is, subjects and direct objects). That the subordinate clause occupies theposition of an NP is further demonstrated by the fact that it can be followed by the encliticindefinite article ♀ èdo), ♂ èo) (24), which attaches to the rightmost element of an NP (23). In
addition, an NP modified by a subordinate clause can still act as a possessor, and, in thesecases, the possessed noun will occur after the subordinate clause (25).9 Notice that therelative clause is postnominal, occurring after the modified noun.

2.6.3 Verbalization of noun-noun compounds       A number of verbs present compound stems which superficially resemble nounincorporation constructions, but which are actually the result of the verbalization of noun-noun compounds. In some cases, the second element in the noun-noun compound is adeverbal noun, creating constructions which may look, at first sight, as the result of valence-changing noun incorporation, as in the example below:(46)   ♂       a.      biuèkI                 wa-Î
                                       ∅-r-a-Èwa- ÎO-d´)èb´)

                       ‘He sat at the top eating jatobá fruit.’
       That ÎO ‘to eat (sweets), suck’ in (46) is in its nominal form (derived by zero-affixation or conversion) is shown by the fact that it requires the verbalizing suffix -d´). Thatis particularly clear when the deverbal noun is derived by consonantal replacement, as in (47)below, where rÈ is the nominal form of the verb kÈ ‘to eat (grains, bread, etc.)’:(47)   ♂              bolo-rÈÈ-d´)èkre
               a-r-a-bolo-r

                                               203
       All the incorporation constructions described above fit well into the traditional,Sapirian definition of noun incorporation, since they involve independent noun and verbstems which can also occur in non-incorporating constructions. I suggest, however, thatKarajá also has a less usual type of incorporation, similar to what has been described bySadock for West Greenlandic (Sadock 1980), involving the causativizer -d´k´). As we haveseen, -d´k´) selects only nominal stems, in such a way that, in order to be causativized, a verbroot must first be nominalized. I suggest that -d´k´), although morphologically dependent, isa noun-incorporating stem.","[213, 214, 215]"

       A common characteristic of lowland South American languages is the existence, withnouns, of different degrees of grammatical possession: there are obligatorily-possessed nouns(e.g. body-part terms, for instance), optionally-possessed nouns (e.g cultural items), andnouns which cannot be directly possessed (e.g. items of nature, such as rocks, water, animals,etc.). That is a well-documented phenomenon in several Macro-Jê languages, includingthose of the Boróro, Jê, and Karirí families (Rodrigues 1999:190-192). In the latter case (thatis, items which cannot be directly possessed), generic nouns such as the ones described aboveare used as possessive classifiers in indirect possessive constructions, such as 43 below, fromBoróro (Crowell 1977:178). In Karajá, however, that is not the case, as any noun can inprinciple be directly possessed (wa-idZOrOTa ‘my dog’, etc.).(43)   a.      i-n-ago      kogariga

               ‘my stone’
       Corresponding to possessive verbs such as English have, Karajá presents aconstruction involving the instrumental postposition èdI attached to the indefinite pronounidZo) ‘some, other’ (44a) or to the possessed noun (44b):(44)   a.      ♂       dIar´)        wa-d¸)eru       idZo)è

                            ‘I have money.’
         While the instrumental postposition is intrinsically unstressed, it is always stressed inconstructions such as the ones above. That is probably another instance of the use of stressshift with subordinating functions (see Chapter 5). This is further illustrated below by aminimal pair (for stress) showing the contrast between the uses of èdI as a postposition (45a)and its use as a possessive predicator (45b):(45)     a.       i-d¸)eruèdI                 [inie""rudI]

                  3-money=INSTR=STRESS
                  ‘the one who has money’8.3.3 Subject agreement         Person agreement displays a strictly nominative pattern, with the verb alwaysagreeing with the subject, be it intransitive (46a) or transitive (46b). Person agreementmarkers are distributed into two different sets, one occurring in the realis (present and pasttenses) and the other in the irrealis (future, potential, and admonitory). These prefixes arelisted in Table 12 below.15
15
   The same set of prefixes is used for singular and plural. There is also a distinction between a first person
plural exclusive (marked by the same set of prefixes used for first person singular) and a first person plural
inclusive (inflected for third person). The prefix k´- ‘3rd person’ is restricted to the centripetal direction of the
irrealis mood.","[54, 55, 56, 57]"

       Notice that the adverbial-like subordinate clauses above are structurally identical torelative clauses which modify oblique domain nouns (as seen in Section 3 above), except forthe lack of a domain noun. That is, the locative clauses above can be analyzed as headlessrelative clauses. This structural identity between relative clauses and adverbial clauses is notunusual. As Thompson & Longacre (1985:179) point out, adverbial clauses expressing time,location, and manner can commonly be paraphrased, in many languages, “with a relativeclause with a generic and relatively semantically empty head noun: time, place, andway/manner, respectivelly;” such clauses have also in common the fact that they can bereplaced by a single word, an adverb, such as today (time), here (location), and quickly(manner) in English and other languages with a clear class of adverbs.","[253, 254]"
"         In (28) below, the relative clause modifies the object of the verb ♀ rakuSi ‘to eat’ (♂
roSi), which is marked by the postposition èb´), as we have seen above (21). The postpositionmarking the object will occur after the relative clause. This is further illustrated by examplesof relative clauses modifying the objects of the postpositions èb´), èlaku, and èkI:(28)     ♂        kiaèrEd´)          ∅-r-∅-´)ièr-ErIèleèb´)

  Intransitive class II verb stems such as obi ‘to see’ lose their initial vowels in the first and second persons of
the realis mood: in the example above, the underlying form of the verb is Îa-obièÎ-a [Îa""biÎa].",[244]
