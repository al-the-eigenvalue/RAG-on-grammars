"              Griffiths   1987 and Griffiths      1991   are descriptions of Kadiwéu   relative clauses and wuinterrogatives.        respectively, including a discussion of constituent order and constituent movement. The author points out that the        constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses varies freely between VSO and SVO, while the constituent order of        subordinate clauses is always VSO. My data shows that the constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses is much        freer than Griffiths reports. Possible orders are OVS, VOS, SOV. OSV, VSO, and SVO. The high frequency of        SVO order in Griffiths’ publications seems to be biased by elicitation technique: I have found that Kadiwéu        speakers tend to translate Portuguese sentences with SVO order. The problem is that, although one can translate        Portuguese sentences word-by-word         into Kadiwéu,    the resulting set of Kadiwéu     sentences      reflects a small        proportion of the constituent order of Kadiwéu,         which has much     freer order. Griffiths never mentions that        (semantic) case is morphologically marked in Kadiwéu, and free constituent order is not unusual among languages        which mark case morphologically.",[16]
        Nonconfigurational languages pose well-known problems for linguistic theory. The existence of free word order       and discontinuous expressions challenges the idea underlying X-bar Theory of a fixed phrase structure over which       syntactic relationships such as subject and object can be defined.,[87]
"             Bresnan & Mchombo (1987) discuss the fact that Chichewa has an optional object marker on the verb. and       when the object marker occurs, word order is free, while word order is rigid when the object marker is absent. On       the basis of these facts, they claim that the object marker and nominal phrases share argument properties. Thus.      when the object markers appears, the overt nominal associated with it is not in argument position and hence is not      subject to ordering conditions. In contrast, when the object marker is not present. the nominal phrase is an      argument and therefore follows a rigid order. Their analysis cannot be extended to Kadiwéu, however. because

            't     One of my informants commented that the orders OSV and OVS are avoided in isolated sentences            in order to avoid ambiguity. Kadiweéu speakers tend to interpret the first-occurring noun phrase as the            subject.      The OSV and OVS orders are used, however, when the context makes it clear who/what is the            subject and who/what is the object.","[142, 143]"
"           Griffiths (1987. 1991) presents a discussion of constituent order in Kadiwéu. He points out that the constituent       order of Kadiwéu main clauses varies freely between VSO and SVO. but is predominantly SVO. My data shows       that the constituent order of Kadiwéu main clauses is much freer than Griffiths reports. Possible orders for main       clauses are OVS. VOS. SOV. OSV. SVO, and VSO:!!",[74]
"        4.2. Kadiwéu as a Pronominal Argument Language
             Jelinek 1984 explains the properties of nonconfigurational languages by proposing that languages set the       elements which can work as verbal arguments.                  According to Jelinek. pronominal clitics and affixes are the       arguments in nonconfigurational languages; nominal phrases are adjuncts, and therefore they can assume free       order or be omitted. This proposal has not been universally accepted. however. The existence of inflectional       morphemes      functioning   as arguments       challenges     the   idea of a fixed phrase      structure   over   which   syntactic       relationships such as subject and object can be defined.                 An altemative analysis would          be to say that the       morphemes on the verb do not replace conventional argument phrases, but that nonconfigurational languages are       nothing more than cases of obligatory pro-drop languages. Baker 1984, for instance, argues that nominal phrases       are adjuncts in Mohawk, but he denies that Mohawk pronominals are arguments. According to Baker. the verbal       arguments are an empty category pro that occupies the projections of the verb. Kadiwéu offers evidence supporting       Jelinek's hypothesis that inflectional morphemes can indeed be arguments in some languages. Arguments are       understood in this work as elements that (i) are in A-position (adjuncts are in A-bar position), (ii) are subject to the       Theta-criterion, and (iii) are subject to special kinds of syntactic operations (i.e. passivization, which affects       arguments but not adjuncts).",[87]
"
            Griffiths says that the constituent order of subordinate clauses is always VSO. but I have found alternative       constituent orders in subordinate clauses as well. In 146 and 147 the subject of the subordinate clause precedes the       verb, while in 148 the object precedes the verb:       (146)      jowo:GotaGa                               me           el:yodi        oqo         oyowo:Godi

"              4.2.1. Kadiwéu Semantic Role Markers.              Many languages that have a free constituent order also have       morphologically marked case. In such languages case markers are like English prepositions in that they assign       semantic roles. Thus. several authors prefer to label these elements as semantic role markers or semantic case       markers (e.g. Simpson 1983).       Kadiwéu fits this pattern. except that it is the pronominal clitics and affixes. rather       than nouns, that co-occur with semantic case morphology.         Kadiwéu has six semantic role markers: -d: ‘theme’. -gi       ‘goal’, -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -ma ~ -lo 'benefactive', -k 'allative', and lokom 'adessive'. Subject markers must be       followed by either © (agent subjects) or -d: 'theme'. Direct object markers must be followed by -d: ‘theme’. Indirect       object enclitics must be followed by one of the following morphemes: -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -ma ‘benefactive’. -       k ‘allative'. -g ‘goal’, /okom ‘adessive'.'*

"
               Complement         clauses     ---     that is. clauses    that   function   as direct   objects   -~- are   introduced   by   the        complementizer mre:        (172)      Ana            me:                      Maria            me              dabagenaGa.

             Although the Kadiwéu word order is free. the subject of the subordinate clause is preferentially placed before       the complementizer. In fact, many speakers reject the sentence if the subject is placed after the complementizer       me:
       (173)       ? Ana      me:                        me              Maria          dabaqenaGa.
                    Ana       y-me:n                     me              Maria          y-d:-baqen-Gan

           Control structures --- structures in which either the subject of the main clause is also the (semantic) subject       of the subordinate clause or the object of the main clause is also the (semantic) subject of the subordinate clause —-       have the same structure. That is, the main and subordinate clauses must be separated by the complementizer me:       (174)     — mejita                                                Maria       me            dabaqenaGa.

            4.1.1.    Constituent   Order.   One striking feature of Kadiwéu syntax is its nonconfigurationa! properties. It       has all the classical properties of a nonconfigurational language: free ordering of nominal phrases with respect to       each other and the verb. pervasive dropping of nominal phrases. and the existence of discontinuous expressions.,[74]
"            Kadiweéu has the classical properties of a nonconfigurational language: any nominal phrase can be omitted.        nominal phrases are freely ordered with respect to each other and the verb, and some discontinuous nominal        expressions are allowed. Jelinek 1984 explains the properties of nonconfigurational languages by proposing that        languages set the elements which can work as verbal arguments. According to Jelinek. pronominal clitics and        affixes are the arguments in nonconfigurational languages: nominal phrases are adjuncts. and therefore they can        assume free order or be omitted. This proposal has not been universally accepted, however. For instance, Baker        (1994) argues that nominal phrases are adjuncts in Mohawk, but he denies that pronominals are arguments in this        language. According to Baker, the arguments are an empty category pro that occupies the projections of the verb.",[14]
"
         Spontaneous speech illustrating free constituent order is not easy to find in Kadiwéu because nominal phrases are       usually absent in this language. Any inflected verb in Kadiwéu corresponds to a complete sentence in English:       (151)     jib:a:taGawa.

                   Grimshaw proposes that verbs in English have an a-structure and are theta-markers.          Eventive           nominals in English have an a-structure as well, but they cannot assign theta-role. Therefore. in order to           have grammatical arguments, eventive nouns need a theta-assigner. Thus, eventive nouns appear with a           preposition in English (e.g. donation of money to hospitals) and with a light verb in some constructions of           Japanese. My proposal is that Kadiwéu does not have any lexical category that is able to theta-assign. The          elements that [ classify as verbs in Kadiwéu        are similar to eventive nominals of of better known          languages: they are valent (i.e. have an argument structure in Grimshaw's terminology) but they are not

"               A severe ban on degenerate feet makes predictions about possible word shapes. If a quantity-insensitive       language allow no degenerate feet at all. then there can be no monosyllables in this language.            Therefore.       monosyllables are predicted to be non-existent in Noble Kadiwéu, which is quantity-insensitive. This is indeed the       case: monosyllabic words must be expanded into disyllables, as represented in 42.       (42)                    a
              Observe in 42 that the vowel is not merely lengthened: instead it is reduplicated into a new syllable. The       syllabic trochee languages which ban degenerate feet studied by Hayes allow no words consisting of a single light       syllable; however,   they do allow monosyllabic words consisting of a heavy syllable. Hayes thus proposes that       syllabic-trochee languages characteristically employ a minimal-word constraint which takes heavy syllables as       proper feet. Kadiwéu conterexemplifies Hayes’ generalization, since all stems containing an odd number of       syllables, even those which contain a long vowel, must be expanded in order to be well-formed. The wave forms in       Figure 2 illustrates the analysis with the monosyllables ve: ‘he died' and ye 'my belly’. which show the same       reduplication pattern. Each peak in the wave represents one independent vowel. Long vowels appear as long peaks.",[42]

"             This dissertation is organized as follows. In chapter 2 I present a description of Kadiwéu phonology and in        chapter 3 I present a detailed description of the verb and noun morphology. Chapter 4 is divided into four sections        that cover aspects of Kadiwéu (morpho)syntax: constituent order and sentence types. pronominals, serial verbs. and        valency/transitivity.",[13]
"               3.1.2. Pronominals.       The Kadiwéu verb is marked for its subject. direct object, and indirect object. Subject       and object markers are prefixes and indirect object markers are enclitics. I analyze indirect object markers as clitics       because clitics, as opposed to suffixes, trigger the deletion of sonorant consonants. Although Kadiwéu has both       subject and object prefixes. they never co-occur. Griffiths & Griffiths (1976) provide a list of transitive verbs in       which some verbs are marked by subject agreement and others are marked by object agreement. but they provide no       systematic account for this fact. Braggio (1981) tries to account for the complementary distribution of subject and       object prefixes in Kadiwéu via phonological rules; unfortunately, though, there is no phonological basis for the       complementary distribution of subject and object prefixes. Intransitive verbs are marked by subject prefixes and       transitive verbs are marked by object prefixes (except for the third-person direct object: when the object is third-       person, the verb is marked by a subject prefix). The Kadiwéu pronominal affixes and enclitics are shown in Table       7:                   Subject                    Direct Object           Enclitics

              Kadiwéu distinguishes 3p! subjects of unaccusative and unergative verbs: n- is only used with unergative verbs.        together with the pluralizer suffix -Ga: with unaccusative and transitive constructions. the verb takes the same        prefix as the 3sg. y-, together with a pluralizing prefix   o- (see 4.4 for definition of unergative and unaccusative        verbs).'° The 3sg prefixe has four allomorphs. @ before anterior consonants (except n- ‘hither’), as w- before a. as        a- before n- ‘hither’, and as y- elsewhere. Kadiwéu Isg and Ipl subject prefixes have two allomorphes. j- before        coronal consonants and /- elsewhere. Pronominal affixes and enclitics are followed by semantic role suffixes in        Kadiweéu (see § 4 for discussion on semantic role markers).","[57, 58]"
"           °°      The claim that nominal phrases in Kadiwéu are adjuncts predicts that the coindexation of a
           pronominal subject and a noun inside a nominal phrase referring to the object is allowed because the           pronominal subject will not c-command the nominal phrase referring to the object. Note. however. that           sentences such as (i) are ungrammatical.          A pronominal cannot be coreferent with a noun inside a           possessive   phrase.    The same     phenomenon    is attested in other nonconfigurational      languages   such   as           Navajo, Warlpiri, and Arandic languages (Ken Hale. personal communication. 1995). The only language          that allows coreference between a pronominal and a noun in a possessive clause is Mohawk (Baker 1994).",[145]
"              Much of the work on SVCs is concerned with the fact that the constituent verbs of a SVC must share a           subject, but several authors have pointed out that the constituent verbs of a SVC must also share the theme           argument. As observed in Baker 1989. the theme argument of the first verb in a SVC is understood also as           the theme argument of the second verb. and when V2 take an object. this object must be marked as an           indirect object. This is the case with Kadiwéu SVCs. In 261 and 263 -ati and ka- normally take a direct           internal argument, but their object must be marked as an indirect object (i.e. an enclitic followed by a           semantic role marker) when they are part of a SVC. as in 262 and 264.7           (261)    Maria      — yati                      lod:a:jo.

                 The semantic role markers -é ‘allative' and -/okom ‘adessive' co-occur with some elements which are           not verbal arguments in languages like English, but they appear to be verbal arguments in Kadiwéu:           (i)   jaqatiweki                                           di:m:igi.

            'S    Recall that the subject of transitive clauses is marked when the object is third-person: when the object            is first- or second-person. the verb is marked by an object pronoun.            Since passivization demotes the           subject of transitive clauses. passivization occurs exclusively when the verb has a third-person object --           that is, when a transitive clause has an overt subject. In this respect. passivization in Kadiwéu is similar to           passivization with the clitic se in Romance languages, which only occurs with third-person objects.","[143, 144]"
"           '0     In active systems the agent argument of a transitive verb is marked like the sole argument of an           unergative verb. which is also an agent semantically. Nonagent arguments (and also possessives) are           marked by a different set of prefixes. In this system agent arguments form a natural class, distinct from           nonagents.       Vestiges of an active system are found in all the Waikurian         languages. and has been           reconstructed for Proto-Waikurdan (Ceria & Sandalo       1995). Although Kadiwéu       marks   Isg, Ipl, 2sp/pl.           and 3sg      subjects of unergative and unaccusative verbs by the same set of    of prefixes. there are some           unaccusative verbs that must be marked by an object prefix instead of a subject prefix (see dictionary):           (i)    God:awela
                  Go-d:-awela
                  [pl.OBJ-theme-scare                  ""We are scared.'",[142]
"
           Although transitive verbs normally contain object markers. a third-person object is usually not marked. because        this is the lowest in the hierarchy. Therefore. when a transitive verb has a subject marker rather than an object        marker, one understands that the object is a third-person.",[61]

           spokenby about 1,500 Indians distributed over
                                                      an area of 538,000 hectares in the State of Mato Grosso do
           Sul, Brazil. The Kadiwéus are the only surviving descendants of the Mbayd people, who
                                                                                               in the 18th.
           century dominated a large extension of the Brazilian and Paraguayan Chaco area. The data for this study
           is comprised primarily of material collected in fieldwork with native speakers of Kadiwéu in Serra da
           Bodoquena, Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil.
               I provide a detailed description of Kadiwéu phonology and morphology. | offer a description of the
           Kadiwéu phonology, on synchronic and diachronic grounds, taking dialect differences into consideration.
           Kadiwéu      has two dialects which reflect gender and social status. Moreover,                 I provide a detailed
           description of the verb and noun morphology. The verb is marked for subject and object in person and
           number.     Kadiwéu    marks subject person with          prefixes, but number (pl)      is marked     with a suffix
           immediately following
                            the root. Aspect
                                         and mood, but not tense, are markedon the verb. There are seven
           aspect markers - completive/incompletive/durative, telic/atelic, repetitive, and intensive - and two mood
           markers, conditional and desiderative.          There are also three negation markers and a set of directional
           enclitics. Among      the WaikurGan languages, only Kadiwéu has a set of semantic role markers. The
           structure of the Kadiwéu noun resembles noun structure in other Waikunian languages as well as in most
           westem      South   American   languages.       The   presence   of classifiers/nominalizers    marking   inalienable
           possession seems to be an areal feature of the languages of western lowland South America.
               Several aspects of the Kadiwés syntax, which bear on theoretical issues, are discussed. Kadiwéu has
           the classical properties of a nonconfigurational language: any nominal phrase can be omitted, nominal
           phrases are freely ordered with respect to each other and the verb,              and some discontinuous nominal
           expressions
                 are allowed.             Jelinek   1984    explains the properties of nonconfigurational
                                                                                                  languages by
          proposing that languages set the elements which can be verbal arguments.                        According to Jelinek,
           pronominal clitics and affixes are the arguments in nonconfigurational languages;
                                                                                      nominal phrases are
           adjuncts and therefore they can assume free order or be omitted. This proposal has not been universally
           accepted, however. For instance, Baker 1994 argues that nominat phrases are adjuncts in Mohawk, but he
           denies that pronominals are arguments in this language. According to Baker, the arguments are an empty
           category pro that occupies the projections of the verb. Kadiwéu offers evidence supporting Jelinek’'s

            hypothesis that pronominals can indeed be arguments in some languages. First, pronominal clitics and
            affixes co-occur with elements which are roughly tike English prepositions in that they assign semantic
            roles: -d: 'theme', -wa ~ -ma ‘dative’, -dom ~ -ma ‘benefactive’, -g ‘goal’, -/okom '‘adessive', -k '‘allative’.
            Nouns can never co-occur with such semantic role assigners. The fact that bound pronominals, rather than
            nouns, are governed by semantic role assigners suggests that Kadiwéu is a pronominal argument language
            of the Jelinek rather than the Baker type. In addition, the results of several syntactic tests support the
            analysis —    passivization,   recursivity, coreference,   anaphora,   quantifiers, and the behavior     of wu-
            interrogatives ~- support the analysis.
                This dissertation also shows that the major lexical categories present in Kadiwéu are nouns and verbs.
            Kadiwéu lacks prepositions entirely. I show that structures previously analyzed as containing prepositional
            phrases are in fact serial verb constructions.
                 Finally, I present the criteria I used to classify the Kadiwéu roots as nouns or verbs. Verbs are those
            elements which are valent; that is, that have an argument structure. Valency representation contains
            information about the number of arguments a verb requires
                                                                and the semantic nature
                                                                                    of those arguments. I
           determine the valency of a Kadiwéu root according to (i) the meaning of a bare root and (ii) the meaning
            of a stem consisting of the reot plus a valency suffix. Although Kadiwéu has valent roots, it has no
            transitive roots.   I understand transitivity as the capacity of assigning theta-roles to complements.
            Transitivity is assigned syntactically via verb movement. This dissertation has implications for language
           typology and linguistic parameters. Jelinek & Demers’ 1994 prediction that transitivity is assigned at the
            syntactic level in all languages whose arguments are pronominals, rather than nominal phrases or an
            empty pro, is borne out by Kadiwéu. | propose a parametric variation based on an insight in Fukui &
            Speas 1986 to account for pronominal argument languages. I argue that in these languages verbs do not
            project. On this hypothesis, clauses in pronominal argument languages are formed by raising of a valent
            lexical item to adjoin a light verb, which is a functional category able to theta-assign.","[4, 5, 6, 7]"

One possible answer            that can be found within Government & Binding theory is that case licenses the presence of grammatical            arguments. Thus, the function of those morphemes could be assignment of structural case. But Kadiwéu            presents evidence against this interpretation.     A morpheme such as -d: can occur with a subject pronoun            (nominative) in unaccusative clauses (310) or object pronoun (accusative) in transitive clauses (311). All            subjects (i.e. subjects of transitive clauses (which only appear if the object is third-person). unergative            subjects, unaccusative subjects. and subjects of passives and reflexives) are in the nominative case in            Kadiwéu. Objects are marked by a different set of pronominals.            If we were dealing with case, I would            expect pronominals co-occurring with -d: to belong to a same structural class (i.e. nominative. accusative.            or ergative). This is not the case —        there is one form that indicates      that the pronominal   is in the            nominative case and another that indicates accusative case and -d: co-occurs with both. The morpheme -            d: indicates the semantic role of a pronominal. theme. not its case. This fact indicates to me that the            transitivity morphemes         are operating on theta   role assignment     --   hence   the label semantic   role            morphemes.

               Moreover. observe that in a control structure like the one in 267 both verbs must be morphologically           marked by a subject prefix: there is no subordinate verb in Kadiwéu which is not marked by a subject           prefix. SVCs have a different agreement pattern — a serial verb is not morphologically marked by a           subject prefix if the subject of the closed-class verb and the object of the open-class verb are semantically           the same:

Kadiwéu control           structures allow relativization of any of the objects: for instance. as can be seen in 270, the object of V2           can be relativized in a control structure. As we have already seen, this is not the case of a SVC.",[113]

"
              One could also wonder whether the Kadiwéu sentences I am treating as SVCs are instead instances of           control structures, because arguments are shared in a control structure. Thus. the subject of the first verb is           also the semantic subject of the second verb in the control structure in 265 and the object of the first verb           is the subject of the second verb in 266.",[112]

Verb and Noun Morphology           The structure of the verb seems to be similar in all the Waikurdan languages.* The verb agrees with the subject        and object in person and number (sg/pl). Kadiwéu, Toba, and Mocovi mark subject person with prefixes. but        number (pl) is marked with a suffix immediately following the root, although               in Kadiwéu the pluralizing        morpheme for the third-person subject of transitive and unaccusative verbs is a prefix. All Waikurian languages        have a directional prefix n- ‘hither’ which is added to a verb stem. They also have a set of enclitics which mark       direction and motion. Aspect and mood, but not tense, are marked on the verb in Waikurian languages. Kadiwéu       has seven aspect markers -- completive/incompletive/durative, telic/atelic, repetitive. and intensive — and two       mood markers. conditional and desiderative. There are also three negation markers.              Among   the Waikurian       languages, only Kadiwéu has a set of semantic role markers.","[49, 50]"
"               Since second person is higher than first person. a transitive verb whose subject is second person and whose        object is Isg can also be marked by a subject prefix rather than an object prefix. In this case, the subject marker        must be followed by the semantic case marker -d: 'theme’.        (94)     ad:ad:e:gi.

                    Since verbs are lexically specified for valency, they do not need to be modified by valency suffixes           in order to take arguments. Even verbs. however. must receive transitivizing suffixes if they have an           internal argument (313).*°      The absence of theta-markers    in a sentence leads to ungrammaticality as           shown in (314).

                   In order to license grammatical internal arguments (i.e. transitive. ditransitive. and unaccusative           clauses), we must add role suffixes. Example 308 and 309 show that a stem functions as a noun or a           transitive verb depending on whether the semantic role markers are present or not.       In 308 they are not           present and the stems function as a noun: that is, syntactic arguments cannot be added in spite of the fact           that the valency suffix -Gen: '[+become]' is present and in spite of the fact that a Kadiwéu speaker           understands that somebody is pierced. In 309, however. the semantic role -d: ‘theme’ is present and the           stems functions as a transitive clause; that is. there is a grammatical internal argument, Go-'Ipl.OBJ':           (308)       lapwaGen:ig:i.

The function of these morphemes,         however, is actually more complex. They license the          grammatical internal arguments.","[128, 129]"

            '9     Baker 1994 observes that the existence of anaphoric expressions in polysynthetic languages violates           both Condition A and B of Binding Theory. Condition A is violated since the anaphoric expression is not           c-commanded by a nominal phrase in argument position. If Binding reconstruction applies. a pronominal           object would be coindexed with a pronominal              subject violating Condition    B. which      states that a           pronominal cannot be bound by a c-commanding antecedent within the same clause. Thus. there is no way           to satisfy the properties of the pronominal          arguments and of anaphoric expressions         in pronominal           argument languages. Baker's argument can be probably extended to Kadiwéu; but since subject and object           pronominals do not overtly co-occur in Kadiwéu.           specific syntactic tests are necessary to test whether           Binding reconstruction applies in this language and to embase the postulation of covert pronominal           arguments.",[145]
"               In Kadiwéu any root can appear in a predicate. But certain roots must be modified by the suffixes           glossed in Table 14 as [+cause] and as [+become] in order to appear in a predicate. Compare examples           278 and 279, the root in 279 must be followed the suffix -ti. [ assume that cause and become are a           fundamental part of the meaning of a verb and [ propose that the suffixes in Table 14 operate on the LCS           of an lexical entry, adding or deleting cause and become. On this hypothesis, the root in 278 is a verb           and the root in 279 is a noun. The addition of -ti introduces cause and an external argument licensing a           noun to occur as the head of a predicate.",[120]

               I asked who said that the car hit Joseph and who said that John washed the dishes. Fifty speakers of           Kadiwéu. including adults and children over six years old, were tested. Some speakers answered that the           subject of -me:n 'say' could be either of the participants of the stories. but the Majority answered Joseph           and John respectively. Some children answered Pau! and John’s mother respectively: these children's first           language was Portuguese, however, and they learned Portuguese outside the village. Children who learned           Portuguese in the village answered Joseph and Joao, respectively, even when the test was applied in           Portuguese, that is. when the stories and questions were conducted in Portuguese.

               Additional examples are shown in 215-218. All the available evidence shows that a pronominal in a            Kadiwéu main clause can be coreferential with a nominal phrase in a complement clause. The data on            coreference constitutes strong evidence that pronominals. rather than pro, are arguments in Kadiwéu.'®

If             nominal phrases are indeed           adjuncts in Kadiwéu, therefore, they should be recursive. There are many examples which come both from           texts and from elicited sentences that show that nominal phrases are indeed recursive. Observe in 219 that           there arc three nominal phrases referring to the object. and in 220 there are two nominal phrases referring

"       Prosodic features have frequently been seen to be especially stable, but when languages remain in contact for       several centuries and a shift process toward the dominant language is slow, the opposite pattern has been attested       Y It took us incredible work to understand our female interpreter, who     was a   little less barbarian than many   of the other
       infidels. One of the major difficulties was to convince the interpreter to say the words spoken by the men, which are different
       from the ones spoken by the women. Since our interpreter was a woman, she gave us the words proper to her gender. Later we
       used those words to talk to the men and they ironically asked us whether we were women: and then they corrected the voice
       and told us the words proper to their gender.",[24]

              Deverbal nouns offer further support. In order to derive avalent deverbal nouns, it is necessary to delete           all the valency features.

                Derived bivalent verbs can also be tured        into avalent nouns. For instance. the unaccusative verb -           Gol:a ‘blind’ can be turned into a bivalent verb by adding -Gad (304). The derived bivalent verb can then           be turned into an avalent noun by attaching both -kan and -Gegi (305). Note that -Gad remains in the           derived form.

              To sum up.

Cause           and become are part of a LCS of a verb and can be added to a noun via valency suffixes.","[127, 128]"

The pluralizers +niwak and +waji can co-occur for emphasis. pluralizing the subject       of intransitive clauses or the object of transitive clauses (98-99):

            Kadiwéu has two dialects which reflect gender and social status: the most salient differences between            Noble and Non-noble Kadiweéu are at the level of suprasegmental phonology. Noble Kadiwéu parses the            word into binary trochees. Non-noble Kadiwéu presents a rare stress system: it parses the word into            iterative ternary feet. Comparison of Kadiwéu prosody with the prosody of the other Waikurian languages            suggests that Non-noble Kadiwéu stress patterns were introduced through interference from Portuguese            and/or Spanish. Chapter 3 comprises a detailed description of the grammatical morphemes found in the            noun and in the verb.,[138]
"           1.2.2. Braggio 1981.         Braggio 1981 is a description of Kadiwéu phonology. including a discussion of some       morphophonemic rules which affect subject and object prefixes. This work is based solely on 23 verbal paradigms.       and therefore several aspects of the language's phonology and morphology were misanalyzed. The author presents       a systematic transcription of Kadiwéu, clearly distinguishing long and short consonants; however, she postulates       that long consonants occur in stressed syllables only, and are therefore predictable. This rule docs not hold: in

         Kadiwéu long and short consonants are phonemically distinct. Braggio observes that subject and object prefixes do         not co-occur, and she tries to account for this complementary distribution of subject and object markers via         phonological rules. My data shows, however, that there is no plausible phonological basis for the complementarity         of subject and object prefixes in Kadiwéu. Moreover, Braggio complicates the Kadiwéu pronominal system by         postulating two sets of distinct subject prefixes. Kadiwéu has only one set of subject prefixes: these undergo regular         phonological alternations according to the semantic case suffix that follows them.","[15, 16]"

          This parameter makes it possible for some languages to have a verbal phrase headed by two verbs. It is          meant to capture the fact that     a SVC       must have only one direct internal argument: the second internal          argument, as note above.      must be an indirect object. According to this proposal. object-sharing takes          place in a SVC because more than one verb assigns an internal theta-role to the same VP-internal NP          position:          (277)                                      S

             This proposal can account for the fact that the the object of V2 must be marked as an indirect internal          argument in a SVC: since the direct internal argument of V1 is also the direct internal argument of V2. if          V2 takes a second internal argument this argument must be marked as an indirect complement.",[116]
