          4 Nouns and Noun Phrases
In this chapter, I discuss Abui nouns and noun phrases. Abui nouns are defined by
their referential properties as lexical items referring to time-stable concrete entities
(unique persons, places, or objects, discussed in 4.1). There are also lexical items that
refer to less concrete (typically) uncountable objects and substances. These lexical items
are ambiguous as they may as well refer to events, and they are analysed as categorially
indetermined (see section 3.2.2). Their grammatical category is determined by their
syntactic context. When an ambiguous item is inserted in the head position of an NP
structure; it is identified as a noun.
        In Abui, there is a systematic difference between animate and inanimate
referents. Animate referents are typically expressed by unambiguously nominal lexical
items. Nouns referring to animates are treated differently in grammatical operations
such as possessive inflection or person inflection on the verbs (see 3.2.4). Inanimate
nouns have a more generic reference and denote substances rather than individuated
objects; they are underspecified for number, shape or size. In discourse, inanimate
nouns often combine with other elements that specify their number, shape, or size.
        Abui nouns combine with pronominal prefixes that express possessors (see
section 4.2). Nouns can be derived by compounding and nominalization of verbal
roots, as discussed in section 4.3. Nouns serve as the head constituent of a noun
phrase, presented in section 4.4. In addition to possessors, the head noun combines
with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives, modifier nouns,
stative verbs, adjectives, quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives. The order of these
constituents is fixed (see 4.4.5). Optionally, an NP may contain an embedded modifier,
typically a relative clause (see section 4.5). Besides expressing arguments, NPs may
serve as the main predicate of a sentence, as a nominal predicate. This chapter ends
with an overview of nominal predicates in section 4.6.","[154, 155, 156]"
"        1.5      Earlier descriptions of the Abui language
As mentioned in 1.3, Abui language was briefly studied by Martha M. Nicolspeyer. Her
dissertation includes an appendix containing a number of glossed texts in Abui as well
as an Abui-Dutch wordlist, but no grammatical analysis. A first linguistic description
was Stokhof (1984).4 In his analysis, Stokhof first defines the area where Abui is spoken
and shows its relationship with other non-Austronesian languages of the Alor-Pantar
area. The descriptive part of the paper is based on a text from Du Bois that describes
an uprising in September 1918.
        Stokhof gives a basic overview of Abui phonology as spoken in Ateng Melang.
It differs from Takalelang Abui phonology (as described in this book) in having the
phonemes /g, v/, and a number of vowel sequences /uɛ, ɑu, ɑɔ, ɔu, ɔɛ/ (cf. Stokhof,
1984:116).
        In nominal morphology, two types of possessive inflection are identified:
inalienable and alienable. Inalienably possessed nouns are semantically characterized as
referring to body parts or kinship relations (1984:120). Pronominal prefixes containing
*t- are described as having generic reference. In verbal morphology, Stokhof
distinguishes free and bound verb stems. Bound verb stems obligatorily combine with a
pronominal prefix (1984:124).
        In syntax, Stokhof claims the basic constituent order to be SOV, but frequent
fronting is mentioned (1984:137). In an NP, modifiers follow heads in the order:
attribution, quantification, specification (1984:139). In a clause, the phrases expressing
temporal settings of an event precede the arguments. The sketch provides rich
comparative data with other Alorese languages such as Kabola or Woisika, as well as
Timorese Bunak.",[28]
"Features of Abui morphology:     (i)      agglutinative morphological structure, elaborate verbal morphology
     (ii)     developed inflectional morphology (aspect, person)
     (iii)    prefixes for person inflection, suffixes for aspect inflection
     (iv)     nouns inflect only for possessor
     (v)      no case inflection of NPs, no gender
     (vi)     no agreement for subject/actor
     (vii)    verbs may combine with up to three bound aspectual markers (two
              suffixes, one clitic)
     (viii)   roots display categorial indeterminacy, sharp division only between
              prototypical nouns (persons) and verbsEvaluation: Abui nouns do not inflect for number nor are they classified for gender, as
is common in many Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:371-2). Nouns are classified
through posture verbs such as ‘stand’, ‘sit’ – long-shaped objects ‘stand’, flat-shaped
objects ‘lie’ etc. Such classification systems are well-known from some of the highland
languages (cf. Lang, 1975). There is no case in Abui, grammatical relations are signalled
with pronominal prefixes on the verb or by additional verbs employed in serial verb
construction. Abui has semantic alignment, a feature also found in other languages in
Eastern Indonesia, Papuan as well as Austronesian (cf. Klamer, To appear-a). Pronouns
in Abui show an inclusive/exclusive distinction, which is typical for Austronesian
languages, but rarely found among Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:376).
        Agglutinative morphological structure and elaborate verbal morphology are
typical TNG features, including the common distinction between ‘medial’ and ‘final’
verbs. In Abui, final verbs are typically fully inflected, medial verbs lack inflection.
While verbs in many TNG languages typically carry subject suffixes, Abui lacks such
subject suffixes. Instead, pronominal prefixes co-indexing undergoers are found, which
are common in many Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:378). Abui roots display a high
degree of categorial indeterminacy. It contrasts with the typical situation in Papuan
languages which make a sharp distinction between nouns and verbs, and in this respect
Abui sides with Austronesian languages that commonly display a high degree of
categorial indeterminacy (cf. Foley, 2000:370).
                                   INTRODUCTION                                       11
       As in other Papuan languages, Abui has a small class of verbs (referred to as
generic verbs in this study) that derive new verbs. This is a feature specific of Papuan
languages (cf. Foley, 2000:386). Generic verbs also frequently combine with other
verbs, and then function as auxiliaries. Abui has no ditransitive verbs and most verbs
may occur in both transitive and intransitive construction. These features are common
among Papuan languages (cf. Foley, 2000:376-7).","[33, 34]"
"NOUNS. Abui nouns are only identified unambiguously by their referential properties
when they have animate referents. Inanimate nouns are typically underspecified for
number, shape, or size; in other words, their reference is generic. Many lexical items are
categorially indetermined and may refer to objects and substances as well as to events.
         Abui nouns are divided in two groups by possessive inflection. Inherently
possessed nouns require possessive inflection. Semantically these are body parts and
kinship terms. This distinction is illustrated in (3), where the bound nominal stem min
‘nose’ combines with the inalienable possessive prefix na- (1SG.INAL). In (b), the noun
fala ‘house’ belongs to the second group of optionally possessed nouns. The possessive
prefix ne- (1SG.AL) marks the alienable possession. In third person, the possessor is
optionally expressed with a noun that precedes the possessum denoting noun, as
illustrated in (c).(3)    a. na-min                         b. ne-fala               c.   maama he-fala

14                                       CHAPTER I
NOUN PHRASES. In an NP, Abui nouns (N) combine, in addition to possessive inflection
(PROPOSS), with a number of adnominal modifiers such as deictic demonstratives
(DEICT), modifier nouns (NMOD), stative verbs (V), adjectives (ADJ), quantifiers (QUANT),
and anaphoric demonstratives (DEM) in a fixed order, as illustrated in (4).","[36, 37]"
"Features of Abui syntax:    (i)      basic Actor-Undergoer-Verb (AUV) constituent, pragmatic UAV order
    (ii)     no adpositions (instead, serial verb constructions are used)
    (iii)    anaphoric demonstratives follow the noun
    (iv)     modifiers follow the head noun (only deictic demonstratives precede)
    (v)      frequent clause chaining without conjunctionsEvaluation: Abui shows clause chaining and tail-head linkage, which are both
commonly found among Papuan languages. It is also very rich in serial verb
constructions. Switch reference, sometimes found in TNG languages (cf. Foley,
2000:384), is not found in Abui. In sum, Abui has many features that are typically
Papuan, but also shares some features with the Austronesian languages of Eastern
Indonesia. There is a possibility that Papuan languages of Alor-Pantar predated the
Austronesian languages (cf. Pawley, 2005-b:100). In that case, it is expected that there
has been diffusion of features from Austronesian to Papuan and vice versa (cf. Klamer
et.al., In press).",[34]

section 4.3.4). The other non-numeral quantifiers may combine with verbs, as discussed
in section 3.5.3.2.

a small quantity of an uncountable referent.(96)    adat      do,     di he-l              seng       kabei do,          di pun-a               ba

referents or a large quantity of uncountable referents. In (97), the quantifier faring

4.4.5      Combinations of adnominal modifiers
The order of adnominal modifiers in an NP is fixed. As discussed in section 4.4, only
the deictic demonstratives (DEICT) precede the head noun; other modifiers follow the
head noun. The order of modifiers is schematically represented in (98), which is a
repetition of the same scheme given in (67):
7The Malay word kepala adat refers to the ‘head of custom, habbits’; that is somebody with the traditional
knowledge who is able to negotiate and enter various contracts in a culturally recognized way.

(98)   NP Æ         (DEICT) (NPOSS PROPOSS-) N (NMOD) (ADJ/V) (QUANT) (DEM)The following examples show the ordering of the adnominal modifiers. Modifier nouns
immediately follow the head noun. They are followed by adjectives and stative verbs
(ADJ/V), quantifiers (QUANT), and anaphoric demonstratives (DEM). A number of
examples of complex noun phrases are given in (99). In all cases, stative verbs precede
quantifiers; the anaphoric demonstratives are the right most modifiers. In cases when
anaphoric demonstratives co-occur with quantifiers, the quantifiers have to precede
them:       DEICT N          V           QUANT                 DEICT       N          V            DEM

       ‘the saliva of his mother over there’
Anaphoric demonstratives (DEM) signal the end of an NP. This is illustrated in (100). In
the left-hand column, a verb follows the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) and is
interpreted as the constituent head of a VP. In the right-hand column, the verb is
followed by the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) and is interpreted as an NP modifier.
This proves that the anaphoric demonstratives are the right-most constituents.

            ‘this house is big’                          ‘this big house’Quantifiers are the second right-most adnominal modifiers. In an NP, they are
preceded by stative verbs and adjectives. When quantifiers are not followed by an
anaphoric demonstrative, they signal the end of an NP. As illustrated in (101) the
stative verb foka ‘be big’ must precede the quantifier ayoku ‘two’ in order to be
interpreted as an adnominal modifier (b). When the stative verb foka ‘be big’ follows
the numeral, it is interpreted as a VP head (a).","[189, 190, 191]"

3.5.7    Question words
The last closed grammatical category contains question words. In Abui, question words
are forms such as nala ‘what’, maa ‘who’, te ‘where, how’, teina ‘when’ and yeng ‘how
much’. These forms always remain ‘in situ’; i.e. in the syntactic position of the
questioned constituent. The question word nala ‘what’ is used as default question word
referring to non-human entities. In (176), nala ‘what’ occurs in two different syntactic
positions. In (a), it occurs clause finally, questioning the identity of the referred object.
In (b), it occurs in the position of the U argument, questioning the complement of ong
‘make’.(176) a. {it        do}clause nala?              b. a         nala    ong?

         ‘what is this (lying here)?’                 ‘what are you doing/making?’The question word nala may be used to question the species or kind of an entity. This
is illustrated in (177). In (a), the kind of a tree is questioned. In (b), the name of a place
is asked in a construction that involves a relative clause:(177) a. it     do      nala bataa?
         lie.on PRX what tree
         ‘what (kind of ) tree is this?’                                       [Note.007.01]

Although both constructions have identical word orders, they are differentiated by their
intonational contour. In (176)-(177) nala ‘what’ is used in interrogative constructions.
In (178), the form nala is used to refer to non-specific entities and is translated as
‘something’. In both cases, the form nala expresses a non-specific U argument of the
verbs nee ‘eat’ and lakda ‘read’:

used to refer to animates. This is illustrated in (179). In (a), the speaker assumes a non-
human actor that caused a bite. In (b), the speaker assumes that the bite is caused by a
human.(179) a. nala e-l          takei?                     b. maa e-l                    takei?

However, the question nala ‘what’ can be used as well. This is illustrated in (180):(180) a. a-ne               nala?                b. a-ne                  maa?

         ‘what is your name?’                         lit.: ‘who is your name?’A question word that refers to space and manner is te ‘where’. As illustrated in (181),
the question word te ‘where’ is found in the position of the questioned constituent (in
situ). In both cases, the question word te ‘where’ combines with the location verb mi
‘be in’:(181) a. fe te          mi-a                   b. a        te        he-mi-a                 taa

         ‘where is the pig?’                        ‘where do you stay, where do you sleep?’The question word te ‘where, how’ combines with the generic root ng ‘see’ when the
direction of a motion is questioned. An example is given in (182), where the form
te=ng combines with the verb yaar ‘go’.(182) ma          e-d-o,             a te=ng      yaar-i?
      be.PRX      2SG.LOC-hold-PNCT 2SG where=see go.CPL-PFV
      ‘well, you, where did you go?’                                              [Note.013.10]In some cases the question word te ‘where’ may be used referentially to express a non-
specific, random location or direction of the event. This is illustrated in (183), where
the speaker expresses that somebody left for no matter where.

question word teina ‘when’ occurs in the left edge of a clause, a typical location for
temporal adverbs, or phrases that indicate the temporal location of an event. In (188),
21 The question word teina ‘when’ is possibly derived. It could be historically derived from the combination oftwo verb stems te-i ‘put where’ and the index verb stem na ‘be like this’ that compose the notion of ‘when’ a
question about the temporal location of an event that is identical to the event described in the second clause.

"       5.8      Development of Abui bound pronouns
Abui pronouns seem to be cognate to the pronominal forms found in other Papuan
languages of Alor-Pantar area. The formal relation goes even further to the mainland
languages of the Trans New Guinea family (TNG), cf. section 1.6. The reconstructed
proto-TNG forms *na and *ka (Foley, 2000) are found in 1st and 2nd singular
respectively and in 1st plural. The velar proto-TNG root [k] indicating second person is
possibly related to Abui glottal [ʔ] that characterizes second person singular. In Papuan
languages, the singular vs. plural number is indicated by the vowel alternation *a ~*i
(cf. Foley, 2000:362; Ross, 2006:29); in Abui, this alternation is found as well. In (Ross
2005), a reconstructed inclusive suffix *-p is given. It is possible that this form is also
the source of Abui inclusive forms pi (1PL.I), po-/pu- (1PL U arguments), and pi- (1PL U
arguments and possessors).
        There is cross-linguistic evidence that diachronically the pronouns were
morphologically complex. The consonant roots identify the person while the vowel
roots mark the number (cf. Foley, 2000:362). In Abui these basic composed
pronominal forms fused later with the generic verbs *a ‘be at’, *e ‘add, continue’, and *o
‘point’ (cf. Klamer and Kratochvíl 2006). In (60), I illustrate the development for
206                                           CHAPTER V
singular bound pronouns. In all given cases, the vowel root [ɑ] that codes the singular
number was deleted. The pronominal form and the generic verb fused into a single
morpheme and became grammaticalized as prefixes.5(60)     a. *n-a-a           fanga      >     *n-a=fanga                >     na-fanga

             ‘you (PL) return down’As illustrated in (a), the vowel [ɑ] deletion process applied. The high front vowel was
preserved. In (b), the high vowel fused with the lower vowel and was preserved. The
resulting prefix has the same form as the PAT prefix. In (c), the high front vowel was
deleted resulting in the REC prefix ro-, or in other dialects ru-. The vowel alternation
seems to reflect the diachronic development. In sum, (60) and (61) suggest that the
pronominal prefixes originate from a serial verb construction. Although this might
seem unlikely at the first sight, there are other serial constructions reminiscent of these
proposed constructions (see 8.4.2). The possessive prefixes developed along the same
path as shown in (62).(62)     a. *n-a-a           táng       >     *n-a=táng             >       na-táng

             ‘my hand’
5 In Abui, the vowel deletion still applies when a stem without word-initial onset combines with a pronominalprefix containing the vowel [ɑ], as discussed in section 2.5.6, in particular example (101).

prefixes (c, d).","[228, 229, 230]"
"       4.4     Noun Phrases
A noun phrase (NP) is a syntactic constituent headed by a noun. It expresses the
argument of a verb. In Abui, the head noun of an NP combines with a number of
adnominal modifiers such as modifier nouns, adjectives, stative verbs, demonstratives,
156                                         CHAPTER IV
and quantifiers. Modifier nouns (NMOD) specify some property of the referred entity
such as shape, size, age, or gender. Adjectives and stative verbs (ADJ/V) specify some
property of head nouns such as colour, quality, size, taste etcetera. Demonstratives
(DEM) are modifiers expressing something about the identifiability and referentiality of
an NP in space or discourse. Demonstratives that locate the referent in space are
referred to as deictic demonstratives (DEICT); demonstratives that locate the referent in
discourse are anaphoric demonstratives (DEM). As discussed in section 3.5.2, both
subtypes of demonstratives are differentiated by their syntactic position in an NP. The
deictic demonstratives precede the head noun while the anaphoric demonstratives
follow it. Quantifiers (QUANT) express something about the quantity of referents
realized as a noun phrase. As discussed in section 3.5.3, there are two subtypes of
quantifiers: the numerals and non-numeral quantifiers. Quantifiers always follow the
head noun. In Abui, there are complex NPs that contain more than one adnominal
modifier. In such complex NPs, the adnominal modifiers combine in fixed order
schematically illustrated in (67). Of all adnominal modifiers, only deictic demonstratives
(DEICT) and possessors (NPOSS) may precede the head noun, which may carry possessive
inflection (PROPOSS) discussed in section 4.2. The nouns, adjectives, stative verbs,
numeral and non-numeral quantifiers and anaphoric demonstratives must follow the
head noun.6(67)    NP Æ        (DEICT) (NPOSS PROPOSS-) N (NMOD) (ADJ/V) (QUANT) (DEM)In the following sections, I will give an overview of each adnominal modifier type. In
section 4.4.1, I describe the modifier nouns that combine with the head noun. In
section 4.4.2, I give an overview of the verbs and adjectives. The demonstratives are
discussed in section 4.4.3. In 4.4.4, I describe the quantifiers. The combinations of
adnominal modifiers in complex NPs are described in section 4.4.5. In section 4.5, I
discuss related complex structures characterized by the intersective linker ba (LNK). In
these structures, a complex modifier (an NP or a clause) is linked by the intersective
linker ba (LNK) to a head noun.","[178, 179]"
"
5   Abui nominal compounds are structurally parallel to complex verbs, which are also right-headed structures.

enumeration of small round shaped objects, for more details see section 4.4.4.1,
examples (89) and (87). In (46), a number of compounds headed by the noun tuku
‘piece’ are given; the left constituent specifies the material of the piece.(46)   bataa tuku                               tipai        tuku

‘chicken nest’ and mutang kadielang ‘bee hive’ given in the fist row may be considered
endocentric. As for the compound ruwol ata ‘chicken nest’, in Alor, chicken usually
nest in mango trees standing in the vicinity of a house. The head ata ‘leaf’ can be taken
quite literally as the nest location of a chicken. As for the compound mutang kadielang
‘bee stipel’, bee hives are usually found high in the trees, attached under a branch. In
that sense, they resemble the stipel of a plant.(49)   ruwol         ata                 mutang         kadielang           birel     patei

because it denotes the category referred to by the compound. In the compound bile
tofa ‘field shelter’, the left constituent bile ‘sprout’ specifies the purpose for which the
house (in this case a shelter) is made. In the compound aremang fala ‘tribal house’, the
left constituent aremang ‘tribe’ refers to the ‘tribe’ as an owner of the house.(51)   bile          tofa                                  aremang fala

Some compounds seem to be calque constructions from Malay. The compound anei
takoi, given in (53), is a literal calque from Malay kacang tanah ‘peanut, lit.: bean soil’.
Note that the order of constituents is reversed to match Abui compound structure.(53)    anei takoi
        soil bean
        ‘peanut’
4.3.2     Exocentric compounds
Compounds that refer to an entity which is not expressed by one of the constituents
are called EXOCENTRIC (cf. Booij 2005:79). Exocentric compounds are right-headed just
as endocentric compounds. A few are listed in (54); they are headed by the noun tuku
‘piece’. The compounds refer to people that are characterized by the property expressed
by the first constituent. The first constituent is in all cases a verb.(54)    mielang tuku                         bui   tuku                    palet         tuku

4.3.3     List compounds
List compounds are non-headed structures; none of the constituents can be pointed out
as the head of the compound. They consist of two nouns that list the referred entities.
These structures are not conjunctions because the order of constituent nouns is fixed.(55)    wil         kalieta                                he-ya             he-maama

4.3.4     Nominalized Verb Phrases
In Abui, there are verb phrases that are used non-predicatively. These verb phrases are
nominalised and possibly lexicalized; they combine with adnominal modifiers (mainly
anaphoric demonstratives) and serve to express arguments. As discussed in section
3.2.2, many lexical items in Abui are categorically indetermined and can be used
predicatively and referentially. The ambiguity is usually resolved by the syntactic context
in which the item is inserted. The presence of a quantifier or anaphoric demonstrative

typically indicates a nominal structure. However, also a number of verb phrases are
nominalised and used referentially, as illustrated in (56). They indicate spatial or
temporal locations that are specified by the first constituent. The final constituent of
these forms is always a verb. The first constituent is either a noun, expressing an
argument of the head verb, or another verb.(56)   war sei                                          war marang

       3II.INAL-tooth be.in-DUR
       ‘two main beams of the house supported by vertical poles with mouth-like endings’In (57), a number of species are grouped according to their typical habitat. The habitat
(a ‘location’) that expressed with an NP is the U argument of the verb ì ‘put’; it is
referred to by the prefix he- (3II.LOC). Observe that the first constituent is a noun (tei
‘field’, mang ‘possession’, or an NP (ahiling tama ‘air’), or another nominalised VP
(tama wal ‘ocean’).(57)   tei       he-ì                                   mang         he-ì

       ‘air animals, flying animals’                    ‘sea animals’In (58), various utensils are referred to by their typical ‘location’. The constituent
expressing the ‘location’ (usually a noun, and in case of ara pe ‘kitchen, cooking place’
another nominalised VP) is the U argument of the verb ì ‘put’.(58)   aremang          he-ì                            gereja he-ì

154                                      CHAPTER IV
In (59), the nominalised VPs with the verb ì ‘put’ refer to the right-hand and left-hand
side.(59)   kang     he-ì                                     bikil he-ì

       ‘right-hand side’                                 ‘left-hand side’The nominalized VPs given in (56)-(59) contain in most cases verbs that refer to
locations such as mi ‘be in’, ì ‘put’, hanai/hanah-a ‘put between’, tai/tah-a ‘put on’, or
pe ‘be near’. In fact, these structures possibly originate as headless relative clauses of the
type illustrated in (60).(60)   nala ba         {ara pe}RC        >     {ara pe}RC ba             >       [ara pe]N

       ‘something that is nearby fire’         ‘that is nearby fire’             ‘kitchen’The nominalised VPs given in (61) refer to containers or instruments. The verb
indicates the typical purpose of the tool. The left constituent is a noun that expresses
the undergoer argument of the verb and the entity, to which the tool is applied. In
Takalelang dialect the word for water is ya; however, in Aila dialect the form is ye.(61)   ye=k                                              fu            lák

       ‘bucket, bamboo container for fetching water’     ‘betel nut container’In (62), the nominalized VPs refer to large bodies of water. The VP is headed by the
verb wal ‘augment, add’ that combines with a single argument.(62)   tama     wal                                      ya      wal
       sea     augment                                   water augment
       ‘ocean’                                           ‘pond’In (63), the nominalised VP da-wa bang (lit.: ‘carry his mouth’) refers to a person that
likes to gossip. This referent is cross-referenced with the possessive prefix da- (3I.INAL)
as possessor of the noun wa ‘mouth’ that serves as the U argument of the verb bang
‘carry’.(63)   da-wa              bang
       3I.INAL-mouth     carry
       ‘gossip, scandalmonger’Nominalised VPs such as dawa bang (lit.: ‘carry his mouth’) probably originate in
relative clauses. In (64), a complex NP is used to refer to a ‘tailor’. The noun ama
‘person’ is the head of the NP and combines with a relative clause given in the brackets.
It is followed by the noun adua ‘master, boss’ in a possessive-like construction.

quantifier loku (PL). As discussed in section 4.4.4.2, the quantifier loku (PL) is an
adnominal modifier that follows the head noun. The quantifier loku (PL) indicates that
the referent is individuated (mostly human) and occurs in plural number. Any stem that
is followed by the quantifier loku (PL) is interpreted non-predicatively and serves as the
head of an NP. This is illustrated in (65) where a number of verbal stems combine with
loku (PL).(65)   pe     loku                                  fing loku

       ‘new people, i.e. Malay people’              ‘the runners, those who run’The constructions with loku (PL) possibly originate in relative clauses. There are
complex NPs containing a relative clause; the head of the NP is sometimes omitted (∅)
and only the relative clause and the linker ba are left over. The next step is to delete the
linker and one arrives at forms listed above.(66)   ama      ba      {firai}RC loku >   ∅ {firai}     loku ba          >   firai loku

       ‘people who run’                    ‘(those) who run’                  ‘runners’Note that the position of ba (LNK) is always following the first constituent regardless of
its function. As illustrated in 4.5, the linker usually follows the head NP. However, if
the constituent order is reversed, it follows the relative clause and the NP is the final
constituent.","[172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178]"

             3 Grammatical Categories
In this chapter, I describe Abui grammatical categories. Grammatical categories are
sometimes referred to as ‘part-of-speech classes’; they are the building blocks of
linguistic structures. Grammatical categories are either open or closed. Open categories
contain a virtually unlimited number of items, while closed categories have a limited set
of members. In Abui, open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed
grammatical categories are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers,
adverbs and question words.
        In Abui, many lexical items appear to be ambiguous. Their categorial
membership must be determined by the combination of their distributional, functional,
and semantic properties (cf. Schachter, 1985; Andward et al., 1997). With the term
‘distributional properties’ I refer to the word-internal (morphological) and word-
external (syntactic) distribution of an item. In section 3.1, I give an overview of Abui
morphology describing various morpheme types (bound, free, prefixes, suffixes, roots,
and stems).
        Word-external (syntactic) distributional properties refer to the status of items in
syntactic units such as phrases, clauses and sentences. Items may be restricted in their
distribution within syntactic units; not all items may occur as heads. Items have
different functional properties. They can express various grammatical functions such as
arguments, aspectual markers, or linkers. Finally, items can have a different type of
reference (time-stable or versatile) and different referents (persons, events, etc.).
        In section 3.2, I describe nouns. Nouns are items that canonically refer to time-
stable concepts such as persons, objects or places. The nominal reference is permanent.
Pronouns are discussed in section 3.3. Pronouns refer to time-stable concepts,
however, their reference is not permanent as the nominal reference but versatile and
context dependent. In section 3.4, I discuss Abui verbs. Verbs are defined
morphologically as items that may combine with REC pronominal prefix and aspectual
markers. Syntactically, they are the head of a verb phrase. Verbs serve as predicates in a
clause and may combine with arguments.
        The remainder of this chapter gives an overview of closed grammatical
categories; they are discussed in section 3.5. The closed grammatical categories are
adjectives (3.5.1), demonstratives (3.5.2), quantifiers (3.5.3), aspectual markers (3.5.4),
conjunction markers (3.5.6), adverbs (3.5.5), and question words (3.5.7).","[88, 89, 90]"
"8.2        Symmetrical serial verb constructions
The verbs in symmetrical SVCs (SSVC) belong to unrestricted sets (as already discussed
in 8.1.2). They do not show any dependency in respect of each other. In general, the
linear ordering of the verbs in a SSVC is the same as order of sub-events building up the
reported event. However, the choice of the verbs reporting various sub-events is
conventionalised as an event has to be reported in a culturally and conventionally
accepted way (cf. Bruce, 1988; Pawley, 1991).4
        The SSVC is sometimes indicated by the presence of an aspectual marker
between two verbs. In (13) the verb ban ‘carry’ combines with the aspectual marker te
(INCP.C) that is not shared with the verb sei ‘come down’. Both verbs form a SSCV
characterized by its intonational properties.(13)    ban=te                sei!
        carry.CPL=INCP.C      come.down.CNT
        ‘bring it down!’                                                            [B02.060.24:01]The borders of a SSVC may be fuzzy, which makes it difficult to determine whether a
SVC is symmetrical, asymmetrical, or hybrid. In (14) the verb me ‘come’ may be
interpreted to be part of two SVCs. It either indicates the direction in which the
4 This type of SVCs is found in other Papuan languages consisting sometimes of more than five verbs in
languages such as Kalam (Pawley, 1987; 1991; 1993; 2004) or Kobon (Davies, 1984).

with nee ‘eat’:(14)     moku loku we-i                  tafui ya         eti        do       bunui me           nee-i

         ‘the children went and hid his crabs and shrimps by them and ate them’ [B02.030.06:28]There are three subtypes of symmetrical SVCs distinguished by their function: narrative
SVCs (see 8.2.1), locative SVCs (see 8.2.2), and synonymous SVCs (see 8.2.3).","[376, 377]"
"
3.5.1     Adjectives
In Abui, the grammatical category of adjectives contains only six items. They refer to
the properties of participants such as colour, size or age just as stative verbs (see
3.4.4.8). Adjectives are differentiated from the stative verbs because they cannot head a
VP. This is illustrated in (120), where the adjectives akan ‘black’ and abet ‘young’
modify the head noun (a, b), and cannot head a VP (c, d). In order to be used as head
of a VP, the adjectives akan ‘black’ and abet ‘young’ must combine with a generic root
in a complex verb. In (e, f), the adjectives combine with the generic root ì ‘put’.

‘white’ are given. It is possible, that the adjectival category contains a few more
members, which I have not found yet. However, most words that refer to participant
properties such as colour, size or age are stative verbs.(121) a. mayol maek                                    b. moku        dakun

3.5.2    Demonstratives
Demonstratives are forms that indicate the location of a referent or event in space or
discourse. They are mainly monosyllabic forms (except for oro) that terminate in the
vowel /ɔ/. Demonstratives may combine with nouns, verbs on the phrase level, and
with clauses on the sentence level.
        Demonstratives that locate the referent in space are the deictic demonstratives;
they always precede the head noun of an NP. Demonstratives that indicate the location
of the referent in discourse are anaphoric demonstratives; they follow the head noun.
In combination with verbs, the function of Abui demonstratives is analogous to the
nominal domain. When the demonstrative precedes the head verb of a VP, it refers to
the location of the event. When it follows the head verb, it locates the event expressed
by the VP in discourse.
        In this section, I first give an overview of Abui deictic demonstratives (see
3.5.2.1), and then discuss the anaphoric demonstratives (see 3.5.2.2). Details about the
usage of the demonstratives in the nominal domain can be found in section 4.4.3;
details about the functions of demonstratives in verbal domain in sections 6.3.2 and
6.4.3.

   3.5.2.1    Abui deictic demonstratives
Abui deictic precede the head constituent and indicate the spatial location of the head
constituent. As in other domains of Abui grammar, the demonstratives are organized
along the relative frame of reference based in either speaker or addressee. The
horizontal distance from the deictic centre is categorized by the axis
PROXIMAL/MEDIAL/DISTAL. The vertical location is specified only for medial and distal
referents. As illustrated in (122), the noun sura ‘book’ combines with proximal deictic
demonstratives do (PRX) and to (PRX.AD). Following Levinson (2003), these deictic
demonstratives refer to the proximate location of a figure (F) with respect of the
viewpoint (V). In (a), the viewpoint is located at the speaker, while in (b); it is located at
the addressee. Often the addressee based demonstrative is used to draw addressee
attention. Mostly, the speaker based demonstrative is used.(122) a. do           sura                         b. to            sura
         PRX          book                            PRX.AD       book
         ‘this book (near me)’                        ‘this book (near you)’In other words, these deictic demonstratives have a relative frame of reference (cf.
Levinson 2003:43-47). They refer to a location with alternating viewpoint (V) over
speaker or addressee (cf. Levinson 2003:24-61).
        The second axis of Abui deictic systems is a horizontal axis that measures the
distance of F from the ground (G). As illustrated in (123), a nearby horizontal distance
of F is expressed with the deictic demonstratives do (PRX) and to (PRX.AD). I refer to
these deictic demonstratives as ‘proximal’. A distant position of F with respect to G is
indicated with the deictic demonstratives o (MD) and yo (MD.AD) that alternate V over
the speaker and the addressee. In (e), the far distance of F, further than the previous
one, is expressed with the deictic oro (DST). In the distal position the alternation of V
does not apply.(123) a. do           fala                         b. o      fala
         PRX          house                           MD house
         ‘this house (near me)’                       ‘that house there (further from me)’
       c. to             fala                      d. yo            fala
           PRX.AD       house                         MD.AD house
           ‘this house (near you)’                    ‘that house there (further from you)’
       e. oro     fala
           DST house
           ‘that house over there (far from us)’The last axis constituting the Abui deictic system is the vertical axis. This axis does not
apply to proximate positions and is absolute (V cannot be alternated). The deictic
demonstratives in (124) refer to vertically oriented positions of F. Medial (less
proximate) positions are expressed with the low medial deictic ò (MD.L) and high medial
deictic ó (MD.H); distal positions are referred to with the low distal deictic wò (DST.L)
and high distal deictic wó (DST.H). The suprasegmental features of a deictic form
112                                          CHAPTER III
indicate either high or low position: the high tone indicates the high position, while the
low tone the low position.(124) a. ò          moku                                            b. ó              moku

"       5.1    Semantic macroroles: actor and undergoer
Event participants are realized as arguments of the verb that encodes the referred
event. The arguments are expressed with NPs and/or pronouns (free and bound
pronouns). Event participants may be identified for two generalized semantic
macroroles actor and undergoer (cf. Van Valin and LaPolla 1997:139-141).
Participants that are characterized as volitionally and actively involved in the event or
state are identified as actors (cf. Dowty 1991). In Abui, actors are realized as the A
argument of a verb with an NP and/or a free pronoun. Participants that are
characterized as not actively involved and undergoing the event or state are identified as
undergoers. In Abui, undergoers are realized as the U argument of the verb with an
NP and/or a bound pronoun. This is schematically represented in Figure 18. An event
is characterized by a number of semantic properties (state, dynamic, etc.). Each
participant carries a number of inherent semantic properties (animacy, individuation).

             [+VOLITION]              Figure 18: Semantic features identifying participants for A and U macroroleInherent semantic properties of the participants (animacy) may be sufficient to
determine the direction, in which an event was performed; i.e. who is acting upon
whom. In most cases, participants identified as actor are animate. They are moving,
consuming, cutting etc; they are characterized by features [+CONTROL] and [+VOLITION]
(in that order). On the other hand, participants identified as undergoer tend to be
inanimate. They are consumed, moved, cut; and so on; so in general, they are
characterized as [+AFFECTED].
        As mentioned in section 3.2.3, Abui nouns do not display any case inflection.
When arguments are expressed as lexical NPs, the semantic roles of the arguments are
determined by the animacy of their referents. This is illustrated in (1), where a transitive
and an intransitive construction are given. In both constructions, the verb occurs in the
final position; the arguments precede the verb. In (a), the verb nee ‘eat’ combines with
the NPs ama ‘person’ and sieng ‘rice’. The NP ama ‘human’ has an animate referent
and is identified as the A argument. The NP sieng ‘rice’ is identified as the U argument
because it is inanimate. In (b), the NP fala ‘house’ is the single argument of the verb fak
‘break’. It is identified as the U argument because it is affected by course of the event.(1)    a. ama         sieng     nee                        b. fala          fak-i
           person rice        eat                                house break-PFV
           ‘someone eats rice/people eat rice’                   ‘a house broke down’In transitive constructions, the order of arguments expressed as lexical NPs is
determined pragmatically. This is illustrated in (2)-(3), where the syntactic order of the
NPs does not indicate whether they should be identified as A or U arguments. The NP
ama ‘person, people’ has an animate referent. It is identified as the A argument. The
NPs kawen ‘machete’ and bataa ‘wood’ are identified as U arguments because their
referent is inanimate. This shows that the semantic role of an argument is identified by
the animacy of the referent. In pragmatically neutral order, the A argument precedes
the U argument. When the order of arguments is reversed, the semantic roles assigned
to the arguments do not change. Instead, the construction with the reversed NP
ordering is pragmatically marked; the fronted NP expressing the U argument is in
focus.

       5.2      Arguments expressed as NPs vs. pronouns
As mentioned above, the arguments may be expressed as lexical NPs and/or pronouns.
In examples (1)-(3), the arguments were expressed with bare NPs. Consider now
example (4), where the arguments of the verb fakda ‘split, break up’ are expressed with
the lexical NPs maama ‘father’ and bataa ‘wood’. The semantic role of the arguments is
identified by the animacy of the referent. In (b), in addition to both NPs, the verb fakda
combines with a bound pronoun he- that co-indexes the U argument bataa ‘wood’.(4)    a. maama          bataa       fak-d-a
             father        wood      break-hold-DUR
             ‘father splits wood’
       b. maama          bataa       he-fak-d-a
             father        wood     3II.LOC-break-hold-DUR
             ‘father splits the wood, (the nearer defined quantity of wood)’               [B05.014.01]In (4), the second construction has a specific reading. The NP bataa, which is co-
indexed by the bound pronoun he- refers to a specific quantity of wood, known to the
speaker. In (a), the NP bataa ‘wood’ refers to any particular quantity of wood, but to
wood in general of unspecified quantity; the construction has a generic reading. In sum,
participants that are [+specific] are co-indexed with a pronoun.
        Another example is given in (5), where the verb kafi ‘scrape’ is used in transitive
construction. In (a), the verb kafi ‘scrape’ combines with the U argument arui ‘ashes’.
In (b), the U argument is expressed with the complex NP e-toku ba yokung nu ‘your
septic leg’. It is co-indexed with the pronominal prefix on the verb kafi ‘scrape, scratch’
because the NP has a [+specific] reference, as it is overtly marked by the anaphoric
demonstrative nu (SPC.AD).(5)    a. kaai diking               pe=ng      marei         ba      arui         kafi-a

pronoun. The alternation is triggered by the feature [±specific]. As for the A argument,
the same alternation is found. In (6), the A argument of the verb sei ‘come down’ is
expressed with the NP moku loku ‘children’. The verb sei ‘come down’ combines with
the U argument sakola ‘school’ that is co-indexed with the bound pronoun. In (a), the
NP moku loku ‘children’ has a generic reading; it does not refer to any children in
particular. In (b), the NP moku loku ‘children’ has a specific reading because it is co-
indexed with the free pronoun di (3A). In this case, the speaker refers to a certain group
of children that he has in mind.(6)    a. moku      loku         sakola       he-sei

           ‘the children come down for some school (education)’                  [B03.003.02]In (7), the NP kaai ‘dog’ is the A argument of the verb fur ‘swallow’. While in (a) the
bare NP has a generic reading, in (b) the bare NP is co-indexed by the free pronoun di
(3A) and has a specific reading (certain dog/dogs).(7)    a. kaai         afu    loku ha-fur-i

           ‘a certain dog/certain dogs swallowed the fish’                       [B05.024.03]Another example is given in (8), where the NP kaai ‘dog’ is identified as the A
argument of the verb loi ‘put far, chase’. In (a), the NP is bare and has a generic
reading. In (b), the NP kaai do ‘dog (that I just talked about)’ is definite. The head noun
kaai ‘dog’ combines with anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) and is co-indexed with the
free pronoun di (3A) as the A argument of the verb. Note that the verb loi ‘put far,
chase’ combines with two bound pronouns; more details about verbs that combine
with two bound pronouns can be found in section 6.2.1 and 6.1.3.

mosquitoes are referred to; the speaker refers to those mosquitoes that were biting him
last night. This is encoded by free pronoun di (3A) that co-indexes the NP kumal
‘mosquito’ as the A argument of the verbs l ‘give’ and takei ‘bite’.(9)    a. war tama maiye               kumal       tafuda mong-e

because the U argument is human. More details about this type of constructions can be
found in section 8.4.2.4.
        The referential properties of the expressed participant may trigger alternation in
their realization as arguments as represented in Figure 19. In sum, the arguments with
[+specific] reference are expressed with a pronoun and an optional NP, while the
arguments with [−specific] reference are expressed exclusively with NPs. The
distributional properties of pronouns copy the distinction found between the two
semantic macroroles. The free pronouns express A arguments, bound pronouns
express U arguments.                                       macrorole                A                                                         U

       5.3      Arguments expressed as free pronouns
As discussed in section 5.2, participants that are identified as [+specific] are expressed
with pronouns; free pronouns express A arguments, bound pronouns express U
arguments. In this section, I will discuss A arguments expressed with free pronouns.
The paradigm of Abui free pronouns is given in Table 21.","[200, 201, 202, 203, 204, 205]"

       1.4    Linguistic situation
Abui is spoken in a linguistically diverse area where Austronesian and Papuan languages
are spoken. The Alor-Pantar area comprises approximately twenty five languages of
which only a number have been studied and documented. Map 2 shows both Papuan
and Austronesian languages spoken in the Alor-Pantar area. The immediate neighbours
of Abui are Kamang, Kui, Hamap, Klon, Kafoa, and Kabola. The map does not
mention Alor Malay, which has an increasing number of speakers in the area. The Abui
community is relatively large (16,000 speakers) compared to other ethnic groups in
Alor-Pantar area. Abui is reported to be the target of language shift in some of its
neighbouring languages such as Kafoa or Hamap (Katubi 2004).
         In the recent past, a large number of settlements (practically all larger villages
such as Takalelang, Fanating, or Mainang) have been moved down from their
mountainous habitat either to the coast or to valleys. As a result of the resettlement,
many settlements are now located near markets, roads, or the sea where they have more
contact with other language communities. These factors stimulate the language shift of
the youngest generation towards Malay. The northern and western settlements such as
Takalelang, Welai, Fanating and Moru are most affected by the shift while small
mountainous settlements are least affected. In Takalelang, most children are brought up
in Malay, though they become more proficient in Abui when they grow up because it is
still the main language used between adults.
         The situation is different in small settlements such as Tifol Afeng, where I
conducted a part of my fieldwork. Here, people are fluent in Malay, but in their daily
lives Abui is the main language and is used in communication with children. Children
remain monolingual in Abui until the age of five or six, the age at which they start
going to school.
         In churches, the situation varies. In Takalelang, the protestant church uses
exclusively Indonesian; the catholic community uses the Indonesian liturgy. Abui is
used in parish council meetings and in worship where the priest is not present, such as
in Rosary worship that takes place in the houses of parish members. The first attempt
to translate the Gospel in Abui has been made by the late Julius Onkari Manimabi. It
resulted in a typescript of the first chapter of the Gospel according to Mark which is
included in the corpus.
         In schools, Abui is banned. Despite official policy stimulating bilingual
education in Indonesia, in Alor education is monolingual and many teachers are
unaware of the official policy. To my knowledge, instruction materials in Abui have not
been made available or developed up to this day.
         In the market, members of various Alorese ethnic groups address each other
using each other’s native terms, which is considered very good manners. Abui speakers
are identified by their pronunciation of the sound [k], which is pronounced as the
uvular stop [q] in word-internal and word-final positions.

        A number of languages given in Map 2 have been the subject of linguistic study.
These include Adang (Haan, 2001), Blagar (Steinhauer, 1991), Kabola (Stokhof, 1987),
Klon (Baird, 2005, in preparation), Kui (Donohue, 1997a), Western Pantar (also
referred to as Lamma) (Holton, 2005; To appear), Sawila/Tanglapui (Donohue, 1997a),
Teiwa (Klamer, In prep.). No linguistic studies have yet been done on Kula, Wersing,
and Retta. There are at least six languages reported in linguistic sources that are not
listed on the map. They are Kaera (Klamer, To appear-b), Kolana (Donohue, 1997b),
Manata, Mauta, Alor Malay (a local variety of the Indonesian lingua franca) and Alorese
(sometimes referred to as Bahasa Alor). Alor Malay and Alorese are spoken mainly in
coastal areas. Alor Malay is being used in many communities to bring up the youngest
generation and is the strongest candidate to become the most commonly used language
in the Alor-Pantar area.","[27, 28]"

specification.

refer to them as [N-modifier noun] NPs. There are two pieces of evidence to analyze
these structures as NPs. First, in syntactic operations, the [N-modifier noun] structures
can be separated; they are not a single unit as compounds. As illustrated in (69), the
head of the [N-modifier noun] NP wil neng ‘son’ can occur as a bare NP wil ‘child’ in
the following clause.(69)   kalieta         neng nuku ai          bikil miei          ya      faling   mi     ya

       ‘one old man came from the left side and gave an axe to his son, his child took it and cut
       the firewood’                                              [B06.073.MPI160MW]Because the right constituent is omitted and the left constituent re-occurs, the left
constituent must be the head and in consequence the structures as wil neng ‘son’ are
NPs. In contrast, compounds are right-headed structures that are lexicalized; their
internal structure is not ‘visible’ for syntactic operations and none of the constituents
may be omitted.
        The second piece of evidence is comes from morphology. Consider the
structure wil neng ‘son’ (lit.: ‘child man’) in (70). In (a), this structure combines with
possessive inflection. In (b, c), the possessive marking appears on each of the nouns
wil ‘child’ and neng ‘man’ independently. The meaning of the possessed structure ne-
wil neng ‘my son’ corresponds to ne-wil ‘my child’ and not to ne-neng ‘my husband’.
From this we can conclude that the structure wil neng ‘son’ is left-headed and
therefore an NP.

age. The modifier noun bilel ‘sprout’ in (71) indicates the young age of the referent
expressed by the head noun, referring to younglings of humans, animals and small
plants.(71)   moku       bilel                     kaai bilel                    fat     bilel

       ‘little cockroach’                   ‘little locust’In the introduction of this chapter, I argued that many nouns with inanimate reference
denote substances rather than well-defined objects. These nouns typically combine with
modifier nouns that specify their shape and size. In enumeration, the modifier noun
typically co-occurs with the quantifier because the head noun is not sufficiently
individuated to be quantified (see also 4.4.4.1). This is illustrated in (72), where the head
noun seng ‘money’ combines with two modifier nouns that specify the shape of the
‘money’ substance. The banknotes are referred to as watala ‘leaves’, while for coins the
modifier noun tipai ‘iron’ is used to indicate the material from which this type of
money is made. Note that both NPs refer to a type of money and not to a type of
leaves or iron, which would be the case if these structures were compounds.(72)   seng     watala                                        seng      tipai

various shapes. These NPs contrast with compounds listed in (44)-(45).(73)   ía       upi              ía         kasing            war kasing

4.4.2     Verbs and Adjectives
In an NP, stative verbs and adjectives serve to specify some property of the head noun
(cf. Payne 1997:63). As illustrated in (75), stative verbs and adjectives follow the head
noun. In (a), the adjective kul ‘white’ follows the head noun kaai ‘dog’, as well as the
stative verbs kiding ‘small’, foka ‘big’ and fila ‘young’ in (b-d):(75)    a. kaai kul                                                b. fala   kiding
            dog white                                                 house small
            ‘white dog’                                               ‘small house’
        c. bataa      foka                                         d. moku      fila
            wood       be.big                                         kid         be.young
            ‘big tree’                                                ‘little child’As discussed in section 3.5.1, adjectives are syntactically differentiated from stative
verbs. Both grammatical categories may serve as modifiers in an NP, but stative verbs
may also serve as a head of a VP and combine with a single argument. In Abui,
arguments always precede the verb, which means that a structure consisting of a noun
followed by a stative verb is ambiguous and may be interpreted either as an NP or as a
VP. On the other hand, the adjectives cannot be used as predicates, heading a VP.
These properties are summarized in Table 18:                    Table 18: Distributional properties of adjectives and stative verbs
                      GRAMMATICAL CATEGORY NP DOMAIN VP DOMAIN                                 ADJECTIVE               Modifier            *
                                STATIVE VERB             Modifier        PredicateThe functional asymmetry between adjectives and stative verbs has a consequence, that
only the structures consisting of a noun followed by an adjective are unambiguous NPs.
This restricted functional property of a noun phrase with an adjectival modifier is
further exemplified in (76). In (a, d, g) the adjective modifier of the noun phrase has an
attributive function, but as illustrated in (b, e, h) it does not have a predicative function.
Instead a complex verb must be used that incorporates the adjectival element:

           ‘a black fruit’              not good for: ‘the fruit is black’         ‘the fruit is black’
       g. baleei      san          h. baleei        san
           banana clean                 banana clean

       i. baleei      san-r-i
           banana clean-reach-PFV
           ‘the banana is ripe’As discussed in section 3.5.1, the grammatical category of adjectives is closed; it
contains only six items. The set of stative verbs is much larger, as shown in section
3.4.4.8. Therefore most NPs that contain an attributive modifier are ambiguous.
Structures that consist of a single noun and a stative verb may be interpreted non-
predicatively as an NP or predicatively consisting of a stative verb combined with a
single argument realized as a bare NP. This ambiguity is illustrated in (77). The
structure consisting of the noun ama ‘person’ and the stative verb tukoi ‘be strong’ is
ambiguous and can be interpreted either as an NP (a) or as N + VP (b).(77)   a. ama         tukoi                           b. ama         tukoi
           person be.strong                               person be.strong
           ‘strong person’                                ‘the person is strong’Structures similar to those in (77) are disambiguated when another NP-domain
constituent is present. This is illustrated in (78), where the numeral nuku ‘one’ follows
the stative verb bui ‘be short’. In Abui, numerals may not modify verbs and therefore
the structure in (b) is identified as an NP. Another constituent that occurs exclusively in
NP domain is the plural quantifier loku (PL). In (d), its presence identifies the given
structure as an NP.(78)   a. lui         bui                             b. lui         bui          nuku
           knife     be.short                             knife     be.short one
           ‘short knife’ or ‘the knife is short’          ‘one short knife’
       c. mayol          fing                         d. mayol fing               loku
           woman         be.eldest                        woman be.eldest PL
           ‘first wife’ or ‘the woman is eldest’          ‘the first wives’As illustrated in (78), the quantifiers nuku ‘one’ and loku (PL) follow the stative verb.
More details about the NP syntax dealing with more than one modifier can be found in
section 4.4.5.
        There are cases, where an NP containing a stative verb seems lexicalized. In
(79), the head noun ama ‘person’ combines with a stative verb. The noun ama ‘person’

may occur independently referring to an unspecified human being. The noun ama
‘person’ combines with the stative verb kang ‘be good’ to refer neutrally to a human
being, as also illustrated in (80). The stative verb kang ‘be good’ can be alternated with
the stative verb beka ‘be bad’, but in that case, the NP has a negative connotation of a
‘bad guy’.(79)    ama         kang                                  ama       beka
        person     be.good                                person be.bad
        ‘person, guy’                                     ‘bad guy, villain’The NP ama kang ‘person, guy’ seems lexicalized. It is typically used to refer to
inhabitants of a village or area. Note that area is referred to as a possessor of the noun
ama ‘person’ with the possessive prefix he- (3II.AL).","[179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184]"

The research reported here was conducted in the context of M.A.F. Klamer’s
‘Vernieuwingsimpuls’-project ‘Linguistic variation in Eastern Indonesia’ funded by the
Dutch Organization for Scientific Research (NWO). Fieldwork in 2004 was funded by
the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project.
      AcknowledgementsThis book is a linguistic account of an amazing journey. As a small boy I used to hear
stories about Indonesia from my father’s friend who worked there and found it the
most beautiful place on Earth. Later, during my studies in Nijmegen, I took courses in
Indonesian and fieldwork methods, and became convinced that I could travel to those
remote islands myself and describe a language.
        The first step of this journey started in Leiden in 2002. My whole-hearted
thanks belong to those who guided me patiently along the journey, and whom, as the
tradition dictates, I may not name.
        Many people accompanied me as the journey unfolded. In Leiden, I owe thanks
to my colleagues at Leiden University Centre for Linguistics for teaching, reading,
listening, good friendship, joyful company, culinary treats, and any possible
combination of these. They are Alwin Kloekhorst, Amir Tauber, Anikó Liptak, Aone

den Heuvel for taking care of practical issues concerning language description.
        In Indonesia, I found hospitality and friends in many places. I thank Uri
Tadmor for sharing his fine home in Jakarta and his colleagues at MPI Field station,
Antonia Soriente and Betty Litamahuputty for a fine company. I am pleased to
acknowledge the official support that I have received from MPI Field station Jakarta
and in particular from Dr. Uri Tadmor as well as from Universitas Atma Jaya, Jakarta
and in particular from Professor Bambang Kaswanti Purwo. I owe many thanks to
Andreas Wijaya, Obing Katubi, Anisah Kortshak, Yunus Riadi Herman, Arnoldus Arif
Kusuma for their friendship and merry company and to Dani Martati for her delicious
cooking and care.
        In Kupang, June Jacob, John Haan, Flori Lake, Christo and Ben always helped
me around. Universitas Kristen Arthawacana Kupang supported my research. When I
stayed with Madah Biha’s family, it felt like home. I also thank Bapak Arkilaus Sabu and
Elias Ndiwa and their families for their great hospitality.
        Once the journey reached Alor, Karsten van der Oord introduced me to the
family of Chris Dani, who looked after me in Kalabahi and shared their home and
delicious food. Karsten took me out for diving, bought me strong liquors, told me a lot
about Alor and taught me how to chew betel nut. Sister Christa, Sister Gisela, Romo
Polce and Romo Toni showed me the pure and humble face of christianity. Many
thanks are directed to Andreas Malaikosa and Neil Johnston from SIL branch Alor. I
also thank Daniel Bekak and Ans Takalapeta who supported my research in Alor.

discomfort and made me laugh on so many occasions. I thank Benidiktus Delpada and
Waksi Maufani, who carried the daily linguistic burden with me, and they carried it so
well. I thank my little friends Fani, Fan Ata, Eman, Simon-Kakak, Lon-Rut, Orpa, and
Peni for taking me for trips to the jungle and teaching me so many things. I also thank
Nelis, Eben, Ande, Loni, Hilde, Nani, Lon Fan for being good villagers. I thank Bapak
Penku, Bapak Vinsen, Bapak Maiku, Bapak Aliku, Bapak Ande, Bapa Elias, and many
others for sharing their stories and language with me. They were tried to teach me the
‘straight’ Abui, but I am afraid it is still quite twisted.
        The first two trips I made together with Louise Baird and Peter Newman. They
looked after me in many ways wherever I went or stayed: in Leiden, Indonesia, and
Australia. Louise was a frustratingly hard-working officemate and a wonderful
colleague.
        In Australia, I am grateful to Bill Foley for valuable comments on many matters,
especially on generic verbs. I thank Andrew Pawley for his support and sharing his
knowledge. John Hajek helped me with Abui tones. I also thank John Bowden, Mark
Donohue and Gary Holton.
        Along the journey, I met my paranymph Floris Scheplitz. Floris accompanied
me on my last trip to Alor, conducting his own ethnobotanic research. It was a true
pleasure having him and Marloes around. I was blessed with the company of the
gentlemen Freek Otte, Eric Thomassen, Martin Vink, Frank de Wever, and Fred
Hamburg, with whom I spent many hours in De Bonte Koe and De Burcht, discussing
sacral and secular issues passionately. I thank Lewis Mayo, Julian Millie, Rati and Joe,
Ivana Hladká, Gershon Kaigere for their cheerful company and many nice dinners.
        I would like to thank my old friends Gerard van Poppel, Jasper van der Weerd,
the late Sjef van Tilborg, Tim Sparla, Tom Willems, Ineke de Kort, Lisette Crooijmans,
Kees van Dongen and Mieke Hoedemakers (with Berend and Willem) in Nijmegen;
Roy van Rijt en Hilde Beurskens in Haelen; Klaas en Anja Visser in Beemster; Kitty,
Marino, Sjoerd (and octopuses), Tijs, and Bas in Rijen; Kamila Krupičková, Johan
Deknopper, Fred Stroobants in Belgium, Martijn Cooijmans in London; and Tomáš
Langášek and Michal Kramář in the Czech Republic, for always being there even when
I was not there. Reinoud, Rienje and Jan visited me in Takalelang and cooked me plenty
good dinners. Thomas made it to Alor only in the belly, but was our companion in all
the following adventures.
        The Eastern European connection was taken care of by Boban Arsenijević, my
second paranymph, and his graceous company Dunce and Lidija. He appreciates
generic verbs, slivowitz, absurdity and melodramatic sentiment and knows that without
these, one gets easily lost, being far from one’s homeland.
        Joanna Sio became another eastern connection. She taught me to appreciate
general knowlegde, food-related metaphors and convinced me to move to Hong Kong.
Joanna helped me through the last months of writing this book.
        At the end of a proper journey, one should go home. I thank my family in the
Czech Republic for allowing me to go and learn that villages on the other side of this
planet are not that different from Dobroutov, the little village where we come from. I
remember those who passed away while I was not there.

                            1 Introduction
This book is a description of Abui, a Papuan language spoken on Alor Island in eastern
Indonesia. It presents essential parts of Abui grammar in a theoretically neutral way.
        This chapter contains some general information about Abui, its speakers and the
area in which Abui is spoken. This chapter is organised in the following fashion. The
geographic position of the area where Abui is spoken is defined in section 1.1. The
genetic affiliation of Abui, together with a brief overview of the historical sources
concerning Alor Island and Abui people, is discussed in section 1.2. In section 1.3 I
give some general information about the Abui community, the number of speakers,
their typical occupation and way of living. The linguistic situation of the area where
Abui is spoken is described in section 1.4. Information about the contexts in which
Abui is used and about language endangerment will also be included in this section. In
section 1.5 I give an overview of previous linguistic efforts focused on Abui; and in 1.6
I discuss Abui genetic affiliation. I present a typological sketch of Abui in section 1.7.
Section 1.8 discusses how the language data was collected. It describes the fieldwork
and gives some basic information about the language consultants. Section 1.9 deals with
composition of the corpus and gives a list of recorded texts that are included in it.
Section 1.10 gives an outline of this book and introduces the conventions in which the
language data will be presented.","[3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

7 Synonymous SVCs are sometimes referred to as ‘parallel’ or ‘synonymic’. They are found frequently in thearea of Eastern Indonesia, as discussed by Fox (1988).

8.3           Asymmetrical Serial Verb Constructions type I
Asymmetrical SVCs of type I (henceforth ASVC.I) consist of a grammatically restricted
‘minor’ verb(s) that follows an unrestricted ‘major’ verb, as defined in 8.1.2. While the
major verb identifies the event, the minor one has the grammatical function of
expressing aspect, direction, manner,8 or mood of the event identified by the major
verb. The order of the verbs in ASVC.I is fixed and grammaticalized.
        The various subtypes of ASVC.I found in this section are discussed according to
the grammatical function of the minor verb: SVCs with minor verbs expressing aspect
are discussed in section 8.3.1. SVCs with minor verbs expressing motion are discussed
in 8.3.2. SVCs with minor verb expressing manner are found in 8.3.3. SVCs with minor
verbs expressing mood can be found in section 8.3.4. One type of ASVC.I is
characterized by the verb-class membership of the minor verb. As discussed in 8.3.5,
the minor verb belongs to the index-verb class. In general, it has a function relating to
manner.","[380, 381]"
"   8.3.2.1    SVC with marang ‘come up’
The minor verb marang ‘come up’ refers to an upward direction or orientation of the
activity expressed by the major verb. Consider the situation in which somebody comes
running up the hill. In that case the construction given in (41) can be used to order
somebody else to run up as next. The major verb luol ‘gain’ combines with marang
‘come up’ that encodes the upward direction of the ‘following’.",[385]

       Samenvatting in het Nederlands
Spraakkunst van het Abui, een Alorese taalDit boek is een beschrijving van het Abui, één van de meer dan een dozijn talen
gesproken op het eiland Alor, in Oost-Indonesië. De sprekers van het Abui leven in het
bergachtige hart van het eiland. De taal wordt gesproken door ongeveer 16.000 mensen
en kent een aantal dialecten. Dit boek is een beschrijving van de noordelijkste dialecten
Takalelang, Tifolafeng en Alila. Abui is een Papua taal, en is niet verwant met de
Austronesische talen van de omliggende eilanden. Abui is verwant met de talen van de
Trans-New-Guinea taalfamilie, die voornamelijk gesproken worden op het eiland
Nieuw Guinea. Alor ligt op een oeroude migratieroute naar Australie en Nieuw Guinea,
maar de precize informatie over de migraties ontbreekt nog.
         Dit boek bestrijkt verschillende gebieden van het Abui. Op het
introductiehoofdstuk volgt de klankleer (fonologie) in hoofdstuk 2. Abui heeft de
volgende medeklinkers: b, p, m, w, f, d, t, n, s, l, r, j (geschreven as y), ŋ (geschreven als
ng), k, ʔ, h, en een aantal medeklinkers onlangs geleend met de woorden uit het Maleis:
c, g, en ɟ (geschreven als j). Er zijn vijf klinkers: ɑ, ɛ, ɪ, ɔ, ʊ die met gewone letters a, e,
i, o, en u, worden geschreven. Allemaal hebben ze lange klinkers als tegenhanger. Deze
lange klinkers worden met twee letters gescheven: aa [ɑː], ee [ɛː], ii [ɪː], oo [ɔː], uu [ʊː].
Binnen de lettergreep vinden we niet meerdere medeklinkers naast elkaar. Dergelijke
medeklinkerclusters worden vermeden; soms worden in morfologisch complexe
structuren klinkers toegevoegd om de clusters te vermijden. Naast lange klinkers, is het
mogelijk twee verschillende klinkers te combineren binnen dezelfde lettergreep. Zulke
lettergrepen worden altijd beklemtoond. Het basisklemtoonpatroon is jambisch, geteld
van het einde van het woord. Uitzonderingen vormen de woorden met een zwaare
voorlaatste lettergreep, want die trekt de klemtoon aan. Naast de klemtoon en de lengte
kunnen de lettergrepen ook nog in toon verschillen zoals fír [fɪ̀r] ‘ster’ en fir [fɪ́r]
‘haasten’. De woorden met een hoge toon worden gemarkeerd met het accent aigu teken.
Abui naamwoorden hebben maximaal drie lettergrepen, maar de werkwoorden kunnen
langer zijn.
         Hoofdstuk 3 behandelt Abui woordsoorten. Het begint met een bespreking van
de woordbouw. Abui is een agglutinerende taal; dat betekent dat een woord uit een
aantal wortels, voor- en achtervoegsels kan bestaan. De naamwoorden hebben meestal
een simpele morfologische structuur. Er zijn geen naamvallen, en geen uitgangen voor
enkelvoud en meervoud. De naamwoorden die naar lichaamsdelen verwijzen, krijgen
meestal een voorvoegsel dat naar de bezitter verwijst. Voor de meerderheid van deze
woorden is zo’n voorvoegsel verplicht. De morfologie van de werkwoorden is in het
algemeen meer complex dan die van naamwooden. Werkwoordelijke stammen kunnen
combineren met (maximaal) twee voornaamwoordelijke voorvoegsels en drie
achtervoegsels voor aspect. Zowel de voorvoegsels als de achtervoegsels kunnen
verplicht zijn. Werkwoordelijke samenstellingen komen veel voor: hoofdstuk 7 is er
volledig aan gewijd.
538                          SAMENVATTING IN HET NEDERLANDS
        Het tweede deel van hoofdstuk 3 geeft een overzicht van Abui woordstoorten,
die verdeeld worden in open en gesloten klassen. Naamwoorden en werkwoorden
behoren tot de open klassen. De gesloten klassen zijn bijvoeglijke naamwoorden,
bijwoorden, demonstratieven, telwoorden, voegwoorden, en vraagwoorden.
Werkwoordelijke en naamwoordelijke stammen kunnen niet altijd van elkaar worden
onderscheiden. Bijvoorbeeld de stam yaa betekent zowel ‘gaan’, als ‘weg, pad’; en de
stam tanga betekent ‘spreken’ en ‘spraak, taal’. Voor een ‘Papua’ taal is zulke
ambiguïteit ongebruikelijk, maar in de omliggende Austronesische talen komt het vaker
voor.
        Hoofdstuk 4 behandelt de Abui naamwoorden. Naast naamwoorden die naar
mensen en plaatsen verwijzen, kent het Abui naamwoorden, die naar substanties en
naar concrete voorwerpen verwijzen. Deze naamwoorden komen vaak voor als een lid
van een samenstelling of worden in een naamwoordsgroep (Noun Phrase, NP) gevolgd
door een ander naamwoord. In beide gevallen wordt hun referentie nader bepaald door
het andere lid van de samenstelling of de woordgroep.
        De Abui naamwoordgroep heeft een vaste woordvolgorde. In het algemeen is
het eerste lid het hoofd. Alleen aanwijzende voornaamwoorden (deictic demonstratives), en
bezittelijke voornaamwoorden gaan aan het hoofd vooraf. Andere leden van de NP
volgen op het hoofd: naamwoorden, bijvoegelijke naamwoorden of statieve
werkwoorden, telwoorden en aanwijzende voornaamwoorden (anaphoric demonstratives).
Daarnaast bestaat de mogelijkheid om een betrekkelijke bijzin of een ander zinsdeel aan
het hoofdnomen te koppelen door middel van het voegwoord ba (LNK) dat ook zinnen
aan elkaar ‘linkt’. Het opmerkelijke is dat een dusdanig gekoppeld zinsdeel zich op de
plaats van zijn eenvoudige tegenhanger bevindt. Dus bijzinnen die de locatie of bezitter
uitdrukken staan voor het hoofd en alle andere volgen erop.
        Hoofdstuk 5 bespreekt de manier waarop de argumenten van een
werkwoordelijk gezegde uitgedrukt worden. In deze beschrijving worden niet de
traditionele termen onderwerp (subject) en lijdend voorwerp (object) gebruikt, maar de
noties Actor (A) argument versus Undergoer (U) argument. De motivatie hiervoor is dat de
wijze waarop een argument uitgedrukt wordt, niet puur grammaticaal bepaald is, maar
vooral afhankelijk is van de semantische eigenschappen van de participanten van een
gebeurtenis. Deelnemers die actief participeren in de gebeurtenis worden als het A
argument uitgedrukt in transitieve en in intransitive constructies. Dat wil dus zeggen dat
in na wan sieng neei ‘ik heb al rijst gegeten’, de eerste persoon enkelvoud participant
op dezelfde manier wordt uitgedrukt als de eerste persoon enkelvoud deelnemer in na
wan firai ‘ik heb al gerend’: allebei met het voornaamwoord na. Maar wanneer
deelnemers niet actief deelnemen, en een gebeurtenis meer ‘ondergaan’, dan worden ze
als een U argument uitgedrukt, door middel van een voornaamwoordelijk voorvoegsel
in plaats van een vrijstaand voornaamwoord. Dus de eerste persoon enkelvoud
deelnemer in di wan na-weli ‘hij heeft mij gewassen’ wordt met een voorvoegsel
uitgedrukt, op dezelfde manier als in wan na-riki ‘ik ben geworden’. De deelnemers in
gebeurtenissen als na wan naweli ‘ik heb me al gewassen’ worden zowel met het A
argument als met het U argument uitgedrukt zoals ook het geval is in vergelijkbare
constructies in het Nederlands of Engels.
        Er zijn drie verschillende typen verbuigingen voor de voornaamwoordelijke
voorvoegsels die het U argument uitdrukken. De voorvoegsels met met de klinker e in
het enkelvoud en een i in het meervoud verwijzen naar een locatie of belanghebbende
                              SAMENVATTING IN HET NEDERLANDS                          539
(location/benefactive). De voorvoegsels met een o in het enkelvoud en een u in het
meervoud drukken altijd een ontvanger (recipient) uit. De voorvoegsels met de klinker a
in het enkelvoud en een i in het meervoud drukken de participant uit die het minst
actief is en het meest een ‘lijdend’ voorwerp is (patient). Sommige werkwoorden kunnen
combineren met alle drie de voorvoegsels. Het werkwoord loi ‘verwijderen, wegleggen’,
bijvoorbeeld, combineert met he- in kaai he-loi ‘een hond blaft erop’. In deze zin
verwijst he- naar een plaats. In kaai ho-loi ‘een hond blaft op hem’, verwijst ho- naar
een persoon. In kaai ha-loi ‘een hond jaagt het weg’ verandert de betekenis, en wordt
ha- verstaan als datgene dat verjaagd wordt. Vervoegingen als deze komen zeer vaak
voor, en worden op een productieve wijze toegepast.
         Hoofdstuk 6 behandelt het werkwoordelijke gezegde. Ten eerste wordt
uitgelegd hoe Abui werkwoorden hun stam vervoegen om het werkwoord aspect weer
te geven. De vervoeging van de stam geeft aan of de gebeurtenis begint (inceptive),
voltooid is (completive) of voortgezet wordt (continuative). Bijvoorbeeld het werkwoord
‘rennen’ heeft twee stammen firei en firai. De stam firei wordt gebruikt om aan te
geven dat het rennen begint of pas begonnen is (inceptive), terwijl firai aangeeft dat het
rennen inmiddels volbracht is (completive). Er zijn een aantal werkwoordklassen die hun
stammen op deze wijze variëren. Het werkwoord kan vervolgens maximaal drie aspect–
achtervoegsels krijgen. Deze geven aan of de gebeurtenis begonnen of volbracht is, of
nog doorgaat. Hierboven zagen we al dat een werkwoord combineert met een of twee
voorvoegsels die het U argument uitdrukken. Abui werkwoorden zijn flexibel, hetzelfde
werkwoord kan in een transitieve constructie gebruikt worden (met twee participanten)
maar ook in een intransitieve constructie (met slechts één participant). Ditransitieve
constructies zoals ‘ik gaf Jan een boek’ komen in Abui niet voor. Deze constructies
worden met een seriële constructie uitgedrukt zoals na sura mi Yance he-ri ‘ik nam een
boek en gaf (het) aan Jantje’.
         Het werkwoordelijke gezegde is de kern van de zin. Het kan combineren met
andere zinsdelen. Naamwoordsgroepen (NPs), voornaamwoorden, bijwoorden,
aanwijzende voornaamwooden (deictic demonstratives) staan links van het gezegde.
Ontkennende en bevestigende partikels, en anaforische voornaamwoorden (anaphoric
demonstratives) volgen het werkwoordelijke gezegde.
         Hoofdstuk 7 is in zijn geheel gewijd aan complexe werkwoorden. Abui beschikt
over een gesloten klasse van generieke werkwoorden (generic verbs). Generieke
werkwoorden hebben een zeer algemene betekenis die vaak pas in het zinsverband
duidelijk wordt. Het zijn werkwoordsvormen die uit een enkele medeklinker of klinker
bestaan, zoals d ‘houden, grijpen, verkrijgen, pakken’. Met behulp van generieke
werkwoorden worden complexe werkwoorden afgeleid van zowel werkwoordelijke
stammen als andere stammen. Bijvoorbeeld van de naamwoordsstam namu ‘wond’ kan
met het generieke werkwoord l ‘geven’ het complexe werkwoord namu-l ‘verwonden’
worden afgeleid. Waneer de voltooide (completive) stam r van hetzelfde generieke
werkwoord ‘geven’ wordt gebruikt dan wordt de betekenis van namu-r ‘gewond raken’.
         Hoofdstuk 8 behandelt seriële werkwoorden. Seriële werkwoorden zijn clusters
van werkwoorden die zich als één groep gedragen: ze vallen onder één ontkenning, één
intonatiepatroon en delen minimaal één argument. Dezelfde gebeurtenis die in het
Nederlands met een enkel werkwoord beschreven kan worden, beschrijft men in Abui
meestal met meerdere werkwoorden. Bijvoorbeeld ‘terugbrengen’ wordt in het Abui
540                          SAMENVATTING IN HET NEDERLANDS
uitgedrukt met de werkwoorden wai ‘draaien’, mi ‘nemen’, en me ‘komen’. Op deze
wijze worden gebeurtenissen feitelijk opgedeeld in deel-gebeurtenissen. Ik verdeel de
seriële werkwoorden in twee groepen: symmetrische en asymmetrische seriële
werkwoorden. Symmetrische seriële werkwoorden bestaan uit werkwoorden die geen
afhankelijkheid van elkaar vertonen zoals pi yaa mit natet tanga ananra ‘we
onderhandelen’ letterlijk ‘we gaan, zitten, staan op spreken en vertellen’ en dat allemaal
onder één intonatiepatroon, in één adem. Asymmetrische seriële werwoorden vertonen
een afhankelijkheid ten opzichte van elkaar. Een van de werkwoorden gedraagt zich als
het hoofd van de cluster. Het andere werkwoord heeft een hulpfunctie. Bijvoorbeeld in
na sieng nee kanri ‘ik heb de rijst opgegeten, let. ik at rijst voltooide’, drukt het
werkwoord kanri ‘voltooien’ het aspect uit van het eten. In na me na-riki ‘ik werd ziek’
is de functie van me ‘komen’ om aan te geven dat het ziek worden op een geleidelijke
wijze gebeurt.
        Het boek wordt afgesloten met een aantal teksten en een woordenlijst.

                         František Kratochvíl was born in the Czech Republic (Havlíčkův Brod) on October 1st,
                         1976. From 1995 to 1998 he studied Czech and Dutch language and literature at the
                         Charles University of Prague. In 1998, he continued his study at the Catholic University
                         of Nijmegen, the Netherlands. He studied Dutch language and literature and
                         Indonesian. In 2002 he received his doctoraal (MA) degree, after which he moved to
                         Leiden to enroll as a PhD student at the Leiden University Centre for Linguistics
                         (LUCL). As of June 2007 he will take up a postdoc fellowship at the Research Center
                         for Linguistic Typology of the La Trobe University, Melbourne.","[551, 552, 553, 554, 555, 556, 557, 558, 559, 560, 561, 562, 563, 564]"

index a single argument (usually A, but U is also possible) that displays some plurality.

The single argument may consist of an NP containing the quantifier loku (PL), or of
two coordinated NPs. In (32), the verb luk ‘rub’ combines with a single A argument
expressed with the NP ama loku ‘people, men’. This argument is co-indexed with the
distributive pronoun ta- (DISTR.PAT). Note that the NP ama loku is also co-indexed as
the A argument with the free pronoun di (3A).(23)     [ama      loku]NP di ta-luk

        5.5       Distribution of bound pronouns
In Abui, there are three sets of bound pronouns, listed in Table 22. Typically, [+specific]
U arguments are expressed with these pronouns. In this section, I explain under which
conditions each of the bound pronouns sets is used.3
       In examples (25)-(27) the verb fanga/fangi ‘say’ combines with a bound
pronoun from each set.(25)     e         na      he-tafaa         he-fangi
         before 1SG 3II.AL-drum 3II.LOC-say.CPL

expressed with the free pronoun na (1SG). The U argument is the NP he-tafaa ‘their3 Multiple realization of the U argument is a feature found in a number of other Alor-Pantar languages. In
Kolana and Kui, the transitive U is realized in multiple ways (Donohue, 1997a). The multiple U argument
realization is argued to be lexicalized for the following Alor-Pantar languages: Klon (Baird, 2005), Kolana
(Donohue, 2004), Tanglapui (Donohue, 1997b), Adang (Haan, 2001), and Western Pantar (Holton to appear-
b), In contrast, as shown in this chapter, Abui argument realization is semantically driven and fluid. In Klon
(Baird, 2005) and Western Pantar (Holton, to appear-b) the multiple argument realization is found in both
transitive and intransitive construction (Split-S).
188                                     CHAPTER V
drums’ co-indexed with the bound pronoun he- (3II.LOC). The example is a fragment of
a bride price negotiation. In such negotiations, the two involved families negotiate
about the presents in form of drums or money to be given to the bride’s family and
others. Here, the speaker bargains saying that he just made an offer about how many
drums the village head will receive. The bound pronoun co-indexes the NP he-tafaa as
theme. It is further discussed in section 5.5.1.
In (26), the verb fangi ‘say’ combines with the bound pronoun ho- (3II.REC) that
expresses the U argument. The U argument is a human recipient affected by the
‘saying’; in other words, somebody who was scold at. More details about the REC bound
pronoun can be found in 5.5.2.(26)    a     ho-fangi         re naha?

indexed with the bound pronoun ha- (3II.PAT). Simon is highly affected by father’s
speaking; in fact, he is a patient that is ‘ordered’.(27)    he-maama         Simon      ha-fanga

        ‘axes, swords and red whetstones’In coordinating constructions, at least two nouns are conjoined by a conjunction
marker or simply listed with an intonational pause after each of the constituents.
Coordinating constructions must be distinguished from list compounds (see section
126                                       CHAPTER III
4.3.3). The order of constituents in a list compound is lexicalized, while in case of
coordinating construction this is not the case.
        The conjunction markers ba (LNK), ya (SEQ), and re ‘or’ may be used in both the
nominal and the verbal domain. The linker ba (LNK) joins two constituents so that they
have shared reference to a single referent or event. I refer to this linker as ‘intersective’.
The intersective linker ba (LNK) may be used in nominal domain to link an NP to other
constituents (relative clauses, numerals, deictics, other NPs) that serve as adnominal
modifiers. In (169), the intersective linker ba (LNK) links the head noun kaai ‘dog’ with
the modifier NP he-bikeng faring ‘his many lice’. The complex NP serves as the A
argument of the verb kafia ‘scrape, scratch’ and it is co-indexed with the prefix do-
(3I.REC).(169) [kaai]NP ba       {he-bikeng faring}NP oro do-kafi-a
      dog        LNK 3II.AL-louse many                 DST 3I.REC-scrape-DUR
      ‘that dog with many lice is scratching (itself) over there’                    [B05.060.02]In section 4.5, I discuss other structures that are linked with the intersective linker ba
(LNK) to an NP. In the verbal domain, ba (LNK) links two verbs as in (170) the verbs
bang ‘carry’ and yaa ‘go’. The events of ‘carrying’ and ‘going’ refer to a complex event
‘carry towards’.(170) tafaa di bang ba              yaa     melang       mi-a-d-i
      drum 3A carry LNK go                  village      be.in-be.at-hold-PFV
      ‘he carried drums to the village’                                           [B02.118.07:50]       The linked verbs form a tight unit that falls under the scope of a negation. This
type of construction is different from serial verb constructions, which are defined as a
verb clusters without any conjunction markers (see 8.1). The use of ba (LNK) in the
verbal domain will not be further analysed in the current description.
       The intersective linker ba (LNK) contrasts with the non-intersective linker ya
glossed as SEQ(uential). ya (SEQ) indicates a non-intersective union of two constituents
(a sequence of phrases or clauses). It may be used in both nominal and verbal domain.
In the nominal domain, ya (SEQ) links two NPs. This is illustrated in (171), where two
NPs are linked. Recall (169), to see the contrast with ba (LNK) that can not serve as a
coordinating conjunction marker.(171) a. Fan Malei ya        Fan Ata                  b. luka-luka     ya       yoikoi

In the verbal domain, ya (SEQ) links verbs that retain their own reference so that the
construction is read as a sequence of events. Example (170) is contrasted with example
(172) below. In (172), the verbs bang ‘carry’ and yaa ‘go’ do not refer to a single event
because the ‘carrying’ preceded the ‘going’.(172) tafaa di bang ya            yaa melang mi-a-d-i

      ‘he carried drums and (then) went to the village’In (173), a more complex example is given, where the non-intersective linker ya (SEQ)
marks that the verbs we ‘leave’, tahai ‘search’ and marang ‘go up’ describe successive
events.(173) a     we ya afu do             kabei tahai ya         marang                  na       nee re

      ‘go and search for some fish and come up, i will eat it up’                            [B06.078.00:37]The linker re ‘or’ indicates a disjoint set of constituents. It is often used in alternative
questions, in which two or more possible answers are presented. It is used in both the
nominal and the verbal domain as illustrated in (174).(174) a. maama       re ni-ya                              b. a          la         taa re a            me?

derived from index verbs or linkers discussed above. A number of such phrases are
given in (175).(175) a. he-ni-l                       ba               b.            he-ni-l                                 mi

       ‘Simon looked at the mobile phone and he did not understand it’           [B10.048.02]The examples (116)-(121) suggest that the location of the modifiers linked with ba
(LNK) with respect of the NP sometimes follows the NP template. Modifiers that
denote spatial position or possessor may precede the NP linked to them with ba (LNK).
Although semantically, the NP functions as the head of the structure, the headedness of
structures with ba (LNK) is problematic on the syntactic level, because the relative clause
or other linked modifier appears in two positions.
         Den Dikken (2006) presents an interesting cross-linguistic account of similar
structures that contain a linker and argues that it is actually the linker that is the ‘head’
of these structures. The other functions of ba seem to support this analysis (see 3.5.6).
The linker ba (LNK) probably originates in the verb ba ‘say’ that is grammaticalized to
an affirmative marker (6.4.2.1). The form ba is sometimes used as a copula, as
illustrated in (122). In (a), ba occurs as final constituent and serves as an optional
copula. Because the NP complement kaai ‘dog’ of the copula clause is itself a verb (the
stative verb kika ‘be red’) a copula is not necessary. However, the linking function of ba
is contrasted in (b), where it is grammaticalized to a relator glossed here as (LNK).(122) a. [kaai]copula topic [kika]copula complement       (ba)

       4.6       Nominal predicates
A nominal predicate is an NP that serves as the main predicate of a sentence. In Abui,
there is no copula that links the nominal predicate with its argument. An example of

nominal predication is given in (123). In (a), the bare NP kalieta ‘old person’ serves as
nominal predicate. In (b), the NP moku fila ‘small child’ predicates over Fan Malei.(123) a. raha       kalieta                        b. Fan Malei moku              fila

This is illustrated in (126) where the index verb n-u ‘be like.PRX’ links the nominal

question word nala ‘what’. Note that the question word nala ‘what’ is in-situ.(127) moku kiang nu             he-n-u                     nala? moku neng re mayol?

8.2.1      Narrative SVCs
Narrative5 SSVCs, sometimes referred to as ‘sequential’ SVCs (cf. Aikhenvald, 2006),
consist of a sequence of verbs referring to a number of sub-events that together make
up a description of the referred event. They typically occur in resuming sections of
narratives, in which they report a sequence of sub-events in a condensed step-by-step
fashion. As illustrated in (15) the verbs yaa ‘go’, mit ‘sit’, nate-a ‘stand up’, tanga
‘speak’ and ananra ‘tell’ are serialized to refer to ‘negotiating’.6(15)     ko     pi       yaa     mit     nati-a              tanga         ananra

         ‘we will negotiate’                                                                [B01.081.00:55]The narrative SVC illustrated in (15) consists of five verbs that act as a monoverbal
clause with respect to negation. This is illustrated in (16) where the negator naha (NEG)
follows the final verb and negates all verbs conjoined in the SSVC:(16)     ko     pi       yaa     mit     nate-a              tanga         ananra        naha
         soon 1PL.I go         sit       stand.up-DUR        speak.CNT tell.CNT          NEG
         ‘we will not negotiate’The set of verbs that are used to describe the event of ‘negotiation’ is conventionalized.
The negotiation is described as gathering, sitting down, standing up again and talking,
and in that particular order. Another example is given in (17), where the event of
‘consulting each other’ is referred by the verbs miti ‘sit’ and pun ‘grab’:(17)     ama         he-ta-mi=ng                       mit-i       tanga      nuku pun-i

         ‘the people were consulting it together’                                            [B10.048.08]5 In this description I use the term ‘narrative’ used by van Staden and Reesink (In press) or Pawley (In press).
This term can be used interchangeably with the term ‘narrative’ coined by Aikhenvald (2006).
6 Examples like this present a challenge of the generally accepted claim that SVCs represent what is a singleconceptual event. Abui is not as radical in this extent as a related Papuan language Kalam (cf. Pawley, 1987;
1991; 1993; 2004).
                                 SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS                                  355
Note that this construction is in fact a ‘hybrid’ SVC because the minor verb mi ‘be in’ is
also part of the SVC. It combines in an ASVC.II with the major verb is mit ‘sit’. The
minor verb mi ‘be in’ combines with two U arguments. The first U argument is realized
as the NP ama ‘person’ and as the bound distributive pronoun ta- (DISTR.PAT); the
second U argument is realized with he- referring to the consulted matter.
        Another complex narrative SVCs that must be qualified as ‘hybrid’ is given in
(18) where only the verbs that are glossed in underscored case combine in a SSVC. Note
that the minor verb ng ‘see’ combines with the major verb ì ‘put’ in an allative serial
construction (see 8.4.2.1). The location is expressed with a complement structure
consisting of the verb mi ‘be in’ and its argument. The complement has some
properties of a nominal; however, its internal structure is that of a VP combined with
an NP expressing its U argument (for more details see 8.4.2.3).(18)    ama     mi     sei                 [na-táng       ho-mi]complement=ng       ì

        ‘the people brought it down putting it down in my hands and I hold it’ [B01.078.01:42]Another instance of a narrative SVC that can be qualified as ‘hybrid’ is given in (19).
The verbs tol ‘reach’, sei ‘come down’, and mi-a ‘take’ constitute a SSVC sharing a
single argument di (3A). The minor verbs kang ‘be good’ and la ‘be.MD’ combine with
tol ‘reach’ in an asymmetrical SVC express modality and event location.(19)    di kang        da-táng        la       ha-tol            sei                mi-a

8.2.2     Locative SVCs
Locative SVCs consist of one or more verbs combined with the locative verb mi-a ‘be
in’. The position of mi-a ‘be in’ is flexible. It can precede, follow, or be in between the
other verbs. The initial position of mi-a ‘be in’ indicates the location of an event
reported by the second verb. This is illustrated in (20) where mi-a ‘be in’ is serialized
with muila ‘play’:(20)    moku bataa wò         mi-a        mui-l-a         mai     bataa ho-fak-i

        ‘children were playing under the tree, when it broke on them’            [B05.013.01]Note that both verbs in (20) share an argument moku ‘kid, child’. The location of the
event realized as the U argument of mi-a with the NP bataa wò ‘under the tree’. A
356                                        CHAPTER VIII
similar example is given in (21) where mi=a ‘be in’ and natet ‘stand up’ combine in a
locative SVC:(21)   di firai          ba     kupai      ha-ril         mia         do-natet-i
       3A run.CNT LNK forest            3II.INAL-edge be.in-DUR 3I.REC-stand.up.CPL-PFV
       ‘he ran and stopped at the edge of the forest’                         [B07.059.03]Both verbs share the same argument expressed as the free pronoun di (3A). The
location is realized with the NP kupai haril ‘the edge of the forest’.
       The verb mi-a ‘be in’ refers to the origin location of an event when it is
followed by a motion verb. This is illustrated in (22) where the origin location of the
verb yaa ‘go’ is expressed by the argument of mi-a ‘be in’ realized with the NP fala
‘house’:(22)   fala       mi-a          yaa!
       house be.in-DUR          go
       ‘go from the house!, lit. be in the house, go!’                             [B03.009.05]In (23) a similar SVC is given; mi-a is serialized with yei ‘fall’ sharing the argument
moku fila ‘small child’. The location from which the small child is ‘falling’ is an
argument of mi-a ‘be in’ expressed as the NP lik hapong ‘front of the platform’:(23)   moku fila              lik          ha-pong          mi-a        ha-yei

       ‘the small child fell from the front of the platform’                       [B07.059.02]In (24) mi-a ‘be in’ and yaa ‘go’ combine each with one place name in a construction
that can be best translated as ‘from X to Y’. The SVC forms a clause marked with the
anaphoric demonstrative nu (SPC.AD); it expresses the topic of the following clause.","[377, 378, 379]"

5.4.1      Referential properties of allophoric bound pronouns
Allophoric bound pronouns come in pairs, in which each of the pronouns glossed as 3I
or 3II has distinct referential properties. The U arguments realized with 3I bound
pronouns refer to the same participant as the A argument within the same domain. The
referred participant is characterized by the features [+affected] and also [+control] and
mostly also [+volition]; it is typically an experiencer. This type of construction serves to
express also reflexives and is discussed in detail in section 6.2.5.
        The U arguments realized with 3II bound pronouns refer to a different
participant than the A argument in the same domain. In prototypical transitive
constructions involving two participants, the affected allophoric U argument is
expressed by a 3II bound pronoun. In (18), both bound pronouns are contrasted:(18)     a. Fani        el         ha-wel-i                    b. Fani         el         da-wel-i

             ‘Fani washed him’ [B01.042.07]                         ‘Fani washed himself’In (a), the 3II bound pronoun ha- (3II.PAT) to express the U argument. The U argument
in this construction does not refer to the participant Fani that serves as the A argument
of the verb wel ‘pour’ but to another participant, outside the discourse domain. In (b),
the 3I bound pronoun da- (3I.PAT) refers to the participant Fani that is also identified as
the A argument of the verb wel ‘pour’.2 This construction is formally transitive but has
a ‘reflexive’ reading as the A and U arguments have the same referent. In (19),
allophoric bound pronouns express a single argument in an intransitive construction. In
(a), the 3II bound pronoun ho- (3II.REC) combines with the stative verb kang ‘be good’.
It refers to a participant that is identified as [+affected] by the state of ‘being good’. In
(b), the 3I bound pronoun do- (3I.REC) refers to a participant of the state of ‘being good’
that is characterized by features [+affected] and [+control]. That means that the
participant is improving his condition himself.(19)     a. ho-kang                                      b. do-kang
             3II.REC-be.good                                   3II.REC-be.good
             ‘he enjoys, he feels good’ [B10.047.01]           ‘he gets better, he recovers’ [B07.060.02]As illustrated in (20), the complex verb ran-r- ‘make quiet, become quiet’ combines
with either one or two arguments. In (a), it combines with two arguments. The U
argument is expressed with the NP n-ièng ‘my eyes’ that is co-indexed with the 3II
bound pronoun ha- (3II.PAT). The A argument is expressed with the free pronoun na
2 The verb root -wel is glossed as ‘pour’ because it refers to washing, when combined with the PAT prefix, andto moving of a body of water when combined with the distributive prefix.

(1SG). In (b), the 3I bound pronoun da- (3I.PAT) co-indexes the only argument of the
verb ran-r- ‘make quiet, become quiet’ expressed with the NP anui ‘rain’.(20)    a. na       n-ièng            ha-ran-r-i                      ba        mit-i

5.4.2     Referential properties of distributive bound pronouns
As discussed in section 3.3.2, distributive bound pronouns express or co-index
arguments displaying some plurality. In transitive construction, distributive pronouns
express or co-index a number of NPs (typically two) that serve as U arguments; they
have a distributive reading. In intransitive construction, distributive prefixes co-index a
number of A arguments acting upon each other (again formally at least two
participants); the distributive pronouns have a reciprocal reading.
        In (21), an example of a transitive construction is given. The distributive
pronoun ta- (DISTR.PAT) co-indexes a number of NPs (underscore in the glossing). The
construction has a distributive reading ‘each’ or ‘one by one’. Note that the A argument
of verb bot ‘order’ is expressed with the NP ama ‘person, people’.(21)    ama        Al Yoka Wat, Ateng Melang, Kuya Tai, Balet Me,                         Fui Miang

proper name Simon. The verb combines with two U arguments: the NP sieng ma
‘cooked rice’ and lukai ‘pepper’, indicating that these two types of food are not eaten
together.","[208, 209]"

demonstratives indicate the proximate discourse location of referents (or events). The
referents (or events) are shared information of both speech participants and may be
considered definite. Such referents (or events) are focused or topical. In the second
row, the anaphoric demonstratives o/lo and yo are given. They indicate the medial (less
proximate) discourse location of referents (or events) in shared discourse. The referents
may be considered definite.
        In the third row of the table, the forms hu (SPC) and nu (SPC.AD) are given.14
The anaphoric demonstrative hu serves as a ‘specific’ marker; it is glossed as (SPC). 15 It
indicates that the referent (or event) is ‘specific’ in the sense that is it ‘accessible’ within
the discourse of the speaker. However, the specificity does not necessarily extend to the
addressee. In fact, the speaker typically uses the demonstrative hu to introduce new
information into the shared discourse. The demonstrative hu contrasts with the
anaphoric demonstrative nu. The anaphoric demonstrative nu indicates that the
referent (or event) is ‘specific’ also from the perspective of the addressee, in the sense
that it is accessible for the speaker in his own ‘discourse’ and shared with the

15 The anaphoric demonstrative hu (SPC.AD) is the grammaticalized index verb stem hu ‘be.like.else.PRF’,which is a homogeneous complex verb. This CV is derived from the generic roots h ‘lack’ and u ‘leave’
indicating that the specific referent has been ‘seen’ previously only by the speaker and is not accessible of the
addressee.

a situation in which Waksi makes nice drawings in his book. Simon wants to have a
look at his book, and asks Waksi to lend him his book. Waksi is afraid that Simon will
lose it and tells Simon that he wants to make a copy of his book before Simon may
borrow it. He uses the anaphoric demonstrative to (PRX.AD) in order to refer to his own
book that Simon talked about.","[136, 137]"
"  4.4.4.1    Numeral quantifiers
A number of NPs with numeral quantifiers are given in (85). In all cases the numeral
follows the head noun:(85)    mayol      nuku                   bal    ayoku                        war buti

well-defined objects. In quantified NPs, these nouns combine with modifier nouns that
specify their shape and size in order to be enumerated. In their function, modifier
nouns are very much like classifiers. The modifier noun bika ‘kernel’ co-occurs in
enumeration with nouns denoting smallish round objects, as illustrated in (87).(87)   na-wet               bika nuku                    h-ièng          bika         ayoku

       cloth    splinter     ten-one                slab splinter one
       ‘ten pieces of cloth’                        ‘one slab (on the poles of the house)’The modifier nouns may also appear in enumeration of human and animal referents to
indicate generic (non-specific) reference. In (89), the nouns moku ‘kid’ , fe ‘pig’, ama
kang ‘person’, and ura ‘sibling’ combine with the modifier noun upi ‘fruit’ to refer to a
number of unspecified referents.(89)   moku        upi      talaama                      fe      upi     talaama

given in (90), where the head noun toku ‘leg’ combines with numerals ayoku ‘two’ and
buti ‘four’. The NP refers to two- and four-legged domestic animals.(90)   he-toku ayoku          buti

  4.4.4.2     Non-numeral quantifiers
A fuzzy quantity of the referent is expressed by non-numeral quantifiers (see also
section 3.5.3.2). Non-numeral quantifiers follow the head noun. There are three non-
numeral quantifiers that will be discussed here; the plural quantifier loku (PL), the
quantifier kabei ‘few, little’ and faring ‘much, many’.
       The quantifier loku expresses the plural quantity and is glossed as (PL). The
quantifier loku (PL) can never be followed by a numeral, which proves that it is not an
instance of plural inflection but a plural quantifier. It combines with referents that are
countable and individuated; such referents are mostly human. The meaning of the
quantifier loku (PL) can be translated with ‘many’ or ‘several’ or with a plural form of
the modified noun; nevertheless, these translations seem to be less felicitous as glosses.
A number of examples are given in (91):(91)   neng     loku                               ruwol        loku
       man     PL                                  chicken     PL

       ‘his armour, his bows and arrows’           ‘(various) clothes’In the clause given in (92), the A argument of the verb sei ‘come down’ is expressed
with the NP moku loku. The head noun moku ‘kid’ is quantified with loku (PL).(92)   moku loku sakola              he-sei
       kid       PL    school     3II.LOC-come.down.CNT
       ‘the children come down for school’                                  [B03.003.02]In (93), the quantifier loku (PL) occurs with the noun fe ‘pig’ in (a). It was used in a
situation where the speaker referred to four pigs. In (b), the noun fír ‘star’ is combined
with loku (PL) to mean a high number of stars. Clearly, the quantifier loku (PL)
indicates “more than one”.(93)   a. fe      loku                                  b. fír       loku

           ‘pigs’                                             ‘stars’In (94), the quantifier loku (PL) combines with proper names that refer to persons,
groups, or areas. However, the NPs that consist of these nouns and the quantifier loku
(PL) do not simply refer to the plural number of these referents but to a group of
people associated with the persons, groups or areas expressed by the proper name. A
number of examples is also given in (11) above.","[186, 187, 188]"
"   7.3.2.1     Semantic contribution of the final root
As discussed in sections 7.1.3 and 7.3.2, the final root of a homogeneous CV is the
syntactic head. An additional function of the final root is that is describes the different
types of events, in similar way as the final generic root in heterogeneous CVs discussed
in 7.2. As the set of the generic roots is limited, the generic roots may be analyzed as
‘event classifiers’. Not all of the generic verbs are equally productive as event classifiers.
324                                         CHAPTER VII
For example, in the tripartite derivations, the verbs h, k, l/r, ng/n, p, t, and i frequently
occur as final root, while l/r, d, ng and i are typically used as final root in larger
derivations or in heterogeneous verbs, and f and b have an overall low frequency. The
verb u is used most often in non-final position, in final position it is ambiguous with
the perfect suffix -u (PFV). The verbs s and m are typically used as initial verbs and
occur rarely as final roots.
          In (74), I demonstrated that the generic root k ‘bring’ can derive other CV stem
from the CV t-a ‘be on, lie’. In (77), the full set of CVs derived from the CV t-a ‘be on,
lie’ is repeated:(77)   t-a-i              ‘put on’                       t-a-h-        ‘already put on’

meanings will be exemplified in (78)-(86). In (78), the use of the CV t-a-i is illustrated.
In (a), t-a-i is interpreted as ‘to put x down’, in (b), it refers to curing a person by
‘putting on’ medicine, while in (c), it is used to express an order as something (a duty)
that the old woman ‘imposes on’ the child.(78)   a. na       yambuk             mi    tai                 nat-i-a

down’ has been completed. Elsewhere in this book I gloss the stem t-a-h- as
‘put.on.CPL’. In (79), the verb t-a-h- is exemplified. In (a) t-a-h- is interpreted as
‘already put x down’. In (b), it is interpreted as ‘x being put down on y’ where the y
argument is expressed with the noun pelang ‘canoe’ The x argument is understood as
the second person.(79)   a. ri    ri-mai                sak      he-tel             t-a-h-i

causes the participant(s) to ‘lie down’. Depending on the context in which the verb is
used, it may get various interpretations, including ‘to shoot x’, ‘to cover x’ or ‘to empty
x’. In (80), the CV t-a-k is used to refer to the ‘bringing down’ of birds and has here the
reading of ‘shooting’. The CV combines with two arguments. The A argument is
realized with the NP Arjun. The U argument is expressed with the NP kuya ‘bird’ co-
indexed as patient with the prefix ha- (3II.PAT)(80)   Arjun de-kartipel         ong     ba      mara              kuya ha-t-a-k

       ‘Arjun made himself a catapult to go up and shoot the birds’ [B06.014.03]Interestingly, when the event of ‘shooting’ was completed, the final root k ‘bring’
alternates with the root p ‘touch’ as illustrated in (81).(81)   mangmat do de-kuya              ha-t-a-p-i                       yaa ba       sei

t-a-k refers to ‘covering’ of one’s head with a piece of cloth, thus being a possible
interpretation of ‘to bring x to lie on y’ where the x argument is expressed as the U
argument of the verb mi ‘take’.(82)   ama        do   di kabala do            mi         de-fui        he-t-a-k-i

speaker to prevent him to step on a snake. The interpretation ‘to bring y to lie’ is
translated as ‘stop, prevent, interrupt’.(83)   ne-feela        di ne-t-a-k                          mading      hu    mon do

       ‘my friend prevented me from being bitten by a snake’                           [B07.012.02]The final GV l ‘give’ encodes an event that is externally caused and involves a transfer
of participants. In the derivation t-a-l this renders the interpretation of ‘to drop x on y’.
This is illustrated in (84)-(85). In (84), the verb t-a-l refers to sewing of tobacco.

verbs ending in ng seem parallel to applicative verbs in other languages. In (86), the CV
t-a-ng is illustrated. In (a) the verb combines with the noun kaai ‘dogs’ that are released
to hunt, while in (b) the benefactive of releasing is expressed with the LOC prefix ne-

involvement of the actor. For example, t-a-ng can contrast with t-a-l ‘to drop x on y’
(discussed above) when it is interpreted as ‘to allow x to drop on y’, for example, ‘to
allow water to drop on the floor’.
        Some more examples of CVs with final generic roots k ‘bring’, i ‘put’, l ‘give’, ng
‘see’ are given in (87) where the verbs are listed in four columns according to the final

8.4.1     Causative SVC with ong ‘make’
In causative SVCs, the minor verb ong ‘make’ introduces an A argument referring to
the acting participant. Consider the causative SVC given in (80) consisting of the verbs
ong ‘make’ and moni ‘die’. The verb moni ‘die’ typically occurs in intransitive
constructions (see examples (60)-(63) in section 6.1.2.1). A causative SVC is required to
introduce an acting participant involved in the event of ‘dying’. The U argument de-ura
‘his sister’ is shared by both verbs. The major verb remains intransitive and indicates
the resultant state of participant realized as the U argument of the verb ong ‘make’.(80)    di de-ura                  ong      mon-i
        3A 3I.AL-sibling.OS make die.CPL-PFV
        ‘he killed his sister’, lit.: ‘he made his sister die’                         [B05.071.02]The causative SVC with ong ‘make’ is used with verbs that refer to events that do not
include acting and volitional human participants such as ‘die’. Note that a similar event
can be expressed with a transitive construction, such as in (81) using the verb fen
‘injure, kill’ that commonly occurs in transitive construction:(81)    di     de-ura                 fen-i

        ‘he killed his sister, lit.: he injured his sister (with intention to kill)’   [B05.071.02]Another verb that does not combine with acting human participant is fak ‘break’. In
(82), it occurs in a causative SVC combining with ong ‘make’. Both verbs share the U
argument bataa ‘wood, tree’. The intransitive verb fak ‘break’ requires the support of
ong ‘make’ in order to express the acting force ahana beka ‘storm’ realized as the A
argument of ong ‘make’.(82)    ahana        beka       di bataa         ong         fak-i

in constructions involving a human participant acting on an inanimate participant, as in

part of the serial verb construction serves as a complement for the verb ma ‘be.PRX’
and in the next step also for the verb re ‘reach’ which are joined in a SVC expressing a
hypothetical condition.(84)     [moku di de-sura                ong     nai-d-i]complement       ma]complement         re,

8.4.2      SVCs with minor verbs expressing participants
The second subtype of asymmetrical SVCs is characterized by the minor verb that
belongs to the generic-verb class (see 3.4.5.2) such as ng ‘see’, d ‘get, hold’, m ‘take, be
in’, l ‘give’, k ‘bring’, p ‘touch’, and ì ‘put’. 14 The function of the minor verb is to
express or specify a participant. The arguments of the minor verbs refer to
benefactives, instruments, recipients, locations etcetera. I discuss the functions of the
minor verbs in the following order: ng ‘see’ (8.4.2.1), d ‘hold, get’ (8.4.2.2), m ‘take, be
in’ (8.4.2.3), l ‘give’ (8.4.2.4), k ‘bring’ (8.4.2.5), p ‘touch’ (8.4.2.6), and ì ‘put’ in (8.4.2.7).","[398, 399]"

3.3.2       Pronominal prefixes
In Abui, the bound pronouns are prefixed to nouns and verbs. Bound pronouns are
divided into three formally distinct sets. Pronominal prefixes are polysemous. They
combine with verbs to express the Undergoer (U) arguments and with nouns to express
possessors.4
        Pronominal prefixes from all three sets combine with verbs to express or co-
index the Undergoer (U) arguments. The U arguments identified as LOC (location) are
expressed with set I, REC (recipient) with set II, and PAT (patient) with set III (for more
details, see section 5.5). Pronominal prefixes from sets I and III combine also with
nouns. They express or co-index possessors (see 4.2). The prefixes from set III serve to
express possessor in inalienable possessive relations (INAL), set I is used to express
possessor in alienable possessive relations (AL). The prefixes from set I are
polysemous, they refer to locations and possessors. In fact, possessors are encoded as a
‘location’ of the possessed entity.5 An inalienably possessed body part is marked in the
same way as a PAT(ient) argument because both are fully controlled by the POSSESSOR4 Polysemous pronominal prefixes used in both nominal and verbal domain are found in other related Alor
Pantar languages such as Teiwa (Klamer and Kratochvíl, 2006; Klamer, In prep.), and Adang (cf. Haan
2001:38, 46). Steltenpool and Stap (1959) report polysemous prefixes for Ekari (referred to as Kapauku), a
language from the Wissel Lakes-Kemandoga group of the TNG family. They observe a similarity between
possessor marking on body parts and kinship terms and the object marking: ‘considering the extremely
passive nature of the acquisition of such ‘possession’ it is not a coincidence that these prefixes are reminiscent
of the passive voice’ (Steltenpool and Stap, 1958:20, translation F.K.).
5 Polysemous pronominal possessor and benefactive markers are also found in Lower Grand Valley Dani(Bromley 1981:190). Lichtenberk (2002) and Margetts (2004) argue for possessive-benefactive polysemy in
broader cross-linguistic perspective.

NPs with three or more adnominal modifiers can be elicited, as illustrated in (102):(102) upi akan        kupil          do

within a single NP. The construction given in (a) contains one adjective and two stative
verbs that are not interpreted as adnominal modifiers but as VP heads. In (b), these
stative verbs are embedded in the NP with the linker ba (LNK) that is discussed in the
following section.(103) a. [kaai kul]NP kalieta takata

       4.5     Modifiers linked with ba
In this section, I discuss complex structures with the linker ba (LNK). In these
structures, the linker ba (LNK) links the NP with a modifier constituent. Linked
modifiers come in a variety ranging from NPs, adnominal modifiers such as stative
verbs, quantifiers, demonstratives, to relative clauses and adverbs. In case of relative
clauses, the relativized NP is usually not expressed inside the relative clause (it is
gapped), unless it is a U argument that has to be obligatorily expressed with a
pronominal prefix. In (104), the linked modifier of the bare NP kaai ‘dog’ is the NP
bikeng faring ‘many fleas’.(104) [kaai]NP ba         {he-bikeng faring}NP oro do-kafi-a

      ‘the dog that has a lot of fleas is scratching over there’                   [B05:060]In (105), the head noun moku ‘kid’ is modified by the stative verb fila ‘be young’. The
NP moku fila ‘little child’ is linked with ba (LNK) to the modifier NP pikai kira
‘stubborn person’, literally ‘hard-headed’:(105) [moku fila]NP             ba    {pikai kira nu}NP
      kid        be.young LNK head be.hard SPC.AD
      ‘a little child that is stubborn’In (106) the bare NP feela ‘friend’ is modified with the NP h-iek bula ‘sharp butt’ that
refers to the fable character Sharp Butt. The modified NP is referred to with the
alienable possessive prefix he- (3II.AL). In the fable, Sharp Butt and Sharp Head venture
to steal coconuts but lacking savvy and solidarity, both die at the end.(106) wah,      [he-feela]NP ba       {h-iek                bula   do}NP   di ò

       ‘wow, his friend Sharp Butt, he is below laughing’                   [B06.077.00:58]In (107), the linked modifier is the deictic oro (DST) that is followed by the anaphoric
demonstrative nu (SPC.AD). The NP headed by fala ‘house’ contains also the numeral
nuku ‘one’. The complex structure expresses the U argument of the verb tukai
‘support’.

       ‘grandfather, your second grandson will actually sit a bit’                  [B02.043.14:32]As illustrated in (109), the linker ba (LNK) may link bare NPs with a single modifier,
usually a stative verb in (a, b). The structures in (a, b) have a restrictive reading.
Consider also the distinction between (b) and (c). While (b) refers to a person that is
bad because of his deeds, (c) has an open reading and refers to a ‘bad guy’, i.e. a person
who does not necessarily do anything bad, but has a potential to do so.(109) a. kaai ba         kika          b. ama          ba     beka          c.    ama         beka

         ‘dog that is brown’                  ‘person that is bad’                ‘bad guy’In (110), the noun ya ‘water’ is modified by the stative verb palata ‘be cold’. The linker
ba (LNK) is obligatory when the following verb dakun-i ‘become dirty’ is to be
interpreted as a modifier (a). The intersective linker ba (LNK) follows the modifier
palata ‘be cold’ and introduces a relative clause. In (b) and (c), the intersective linker ba
(LNK) is not present; consequently, both constructions have a different reading. In (c),
the anaphoric demonstrative do (PRX) follows the verb dakun-i ‘become dirty’. The
demonstrative is not interpreted as an adnominal modifier because the verb dakun-i
‘become dirty’ is not embedded but predicates over the NP ya palata ‘cold water’. For
the clause level functions of anaphoric demonstratives see section 6.4.3.(110) a. [ya       palata]NP ba       {dakun-i do}RC             b. [ya          palata]NP dakun-i

         ‘the cold water that became dirty’                          ‘cold water became dirty’

            water     be.cold     dirty-put     PRX
            ‘cold water just became dirty’In (111), a full relative clause modifies the list compound NP fu meting ‘betel nut and
betel vine’. The relative clause consists of the A argument ama ‘person’ and the two

verbs mi ‘take’ and sei ‘come down’ conjoined in a serial verb construction. The NP fu
meting ‘betel nut and betel vine’ is logically the U argument of the verb mi ‘take’ but in
the relative clause it is gapped.(111) [fu          meting]NP ba          {ama mi sei                      nu}RC na mi yaa

structure, the intersective linker ba (LNK) links the bare NP kafiei ‘goat’ with the relative
clause nai-d-i nu ‘became lost (some time ago)’. Note that the head noun kafiei ‘goat’ is
the single argument of the verb nai-d- ‘get lost’.(112) moku loku la                sawai [kafiei]NP ba             {nai-d-i       nu}RC     tahai

noun fe ‘pig’ is co-indexed as the possessor of the noun toku ‘leg’ in the relative clause.
The noun toku ‘leg’ serves as the U argument of the verb kor ‘bind’. The A argument
of the verb kor ‘bind’ is not expressed. Note that the relativized NP fe ‘pig’ is co-
indexed with the possessive prefix he- (3II.AL) and PAT prefix ha- (3II.PAT) inside the
relative clause.(113) [fe]NP ba          {he-toku ha-kor-i                     yo}RC

in the relative clause. The verb ong ‘make’ is serialized with the verb fak ‘break’ with
which it shares its U argument fala ‘house’. The A argument of the verb ong ‘make’ is
tayoka ‘earthquake’.(114) [fala]NP       ba {tayoka       ong    fak-i        nu}RC     ama      da-wai

        ‘that house that was destroyed by the earthquake, people are again repairing it’In (115), one of the most complex structures found in my corpus is given. The NP
headed by fala ‘house’ contains a possessor e-maama mantan kades ‘your father,
former village head’. This NP is linked with a large relative clause given between curly
172                                    CHAPTER IV
brackets. The example comes from a conversation concerning the place name Fota
Ailol. The name refers to a place with a large wide stone that used to be a resting place
in the old days. The speaker described the stone as being located with respect to the
house of the addressee’s uncle. He refers to the house as standing below a big and wide
stone like this.(115) he-n               wò     sei                  [(e-maama        mantan         kades)POSS

a modifier in a structure that functions as single NP. In fact, this definition can be
expanded also to the clause level, as the linker ba (LNK) serves to link verbs in a single
clause (see also section 3.5.6). The linked ba (LNK) has an intersective function; it links
two constituents to a single unit on the level of one of them.
        In the complex NPs given so far, the NP precedes the linker ba (LNK) linking it
with a modifier constituent (adnominal modifier or a clause). The modified NP may be
considered as the head of the construction. However, in some cases, the modifying
constituent precedes the noun or the noun may be omitted. The modifier constituent
has either deictic or possessive function and its location corresponds to the location of
deictics and possessors within the NP. In (116), the relative clause nopa mia ‘be
touching on me’ precedes the NP bataa do ‘the wood’. The linker ba (LNK) follows the
clause. In (b), the expected constituent order is given which is also attested.(116) a. {no-pa                 mi-a}RC ba           [bataa do]NP         ha-fik-i

           ‘the log that is on me’In (117), the relative clause has a deictic function. It precedes the NP ama kang do ‘the
people’. The relative clause is external and it precedes its head ama ‘person’ because its
function is deictic; its structure is parallel to that of an NP. As discussed above, deictic
modifiers precede the head noun in the NP.(117) {melang afeng mi-a}RC ba                [ama         kang      do]NP

In (118), the relative clause is followed by the quantifier loku (PL). The head of the NP
ama ‘person’ is not expressed but its expected position is marked with ∅ following the
relative clause. Because the head is not expressed intersective linker ba (LNK) follows

        Distributive reference prefixes are listed in the third section of the table.
Distributive prefixes express arguments with some plural characteristics. Distributive
prefixes have a distributive reading in transitive constructions and a reciprocal reading
in intransitive constructions, as illustrated in (32):           PROA [        N PU       ] PROUV

plurality. It typically occurs as the default possessor marker with body parts. This is
illustrated in (33), where in (a) the body part -táng ‘hand’. In (b), the distributive prefix
from set I te- (DISTR.AL) combines with the noun faling ‘axe’ to refer to distributively
possessed ‘axes’.(33)   a. ta-táng                                     b. te-faling

6.1.4      Argument incorporation
As discussed in the previous section, pronominal prefixes are attached to the verb stem;
no other constituent may intervene between them and the stem. This is illustrated in
(100), where the verb pun ‘grab’ combines with the pronominal form ho- (3II.REC). The
referent of the NP pingai ‘plate’ is [+specific], [+individuated], and [−change of state].6(100) a. neng     kalieta        nuku            di pingai [ho-pun-a]VP

            man        old.person      one       3A 3II.REC-plate hold.CPL-DURIn a few examples, nouns expressing U arguments may occur between a prefix and the
verb. I analyze these constructions as involving an incorporated argument. In (101), the
VP headed by the verb panen ‘make’ contains an incorporated U argument. The
evidence is morphological. Observe the REC prefix do- (3I.REC). The REC prefix is the
only type of prefix that may occur only in verbal domain; it never expresses possessors.
In (101), it expresses the U argument of the complex verb yai paneng ‘sing’, literally
‘make songs’ and refers to the human participant that is singing for himself. This is an
instance of an A≡UREC experiencer construction (6.2.5.1), where the A argument di
(3A) is not expressed. As discussed in 5.7.3, such constructions encode a participant
performing an event unintentionally. The VP further contains two aspectual suffixes.(101) do-yai         panen-i-a                ba      baloka      bel
      3I.REC-song make.CPL-PFV-DUR            LNK grass           pull
      ‘he is singing (to himself) while weeding, pulling out the grass, weeds’          [B07.035.03]In examples (70)-(72), the verb paneng ‘make’ occur in VPs without incorporated
arguments. Another example is given in (102), where noun baloka ‘grass’ is
incorporated in the VP headed by the verb ber- ‘pull’. Also in this case, the REC prefix
do- (3I.REC) is attached to the noun. Observe, that the verb panen ‘make’ is used in an
A-U transitive construction (see 6.2.2.1). The human participant is realized as the A
argument with the free pronoun di (3A). The REC prefix do- (3I.REC) that is attached to
the incorporated noun baloka ‘grass’ co-indexes the same human referent.(102) di     yai panen           do     do-baloka ber-i-a
      3A     song make.CPL PRX 3A.REC-grass pull.CPL-PFV-DUR
      ‘while she sings she is weeding (grass-pulling) (unintentionally)’                [B07.035.03]In (103), the prefix do- (3I.REC) is attached in front of the noun adik ‘mat’; the noun is
incorporated in the VP headed by tinei ‘plait’.","[260, 261]"

8.1.2     Composition and semantics of SVCs
Abui serial verb constructions are divided into two types according to their
compositional and semantic properties. The SVCs of the first type consist of verbs
belonging to unrestricted set (see 8.2). These verbs are of equal grammatical status; they
do not show any dependency with respect to each other. This means that none of the
verbs in the first type of SVC is semantically ‘dominant’. As illustrated in (10) a number
of verbs combine refer to a single event. The ordering of verbs is conventionalized; it
reflects the established conventions about how things are done in Abui community:(10)    yaa mit         nate-a           tanga      ananra                    ‘negotiate’
        go     sit      stand.up-DUR     speak      tell
        yaa mit nate-a                 tanga ananra tikak             fak     ‘negotiate about peace’
        go     sit    stand.up-DUR     speak tell          arrow      break
        mi     me       feng                                                  ‘bring to slaughter’
        take come injure        In Abui, the SVCs of the second type consist of restricted verb(s) combined
with unrestricted verb(s). The unrestricted verb is semantically ‘dominant’ as it
expresses the event. The restricted verb is semantically ‘dependent’ verb of the
structure in the sense that is has a grammatical function(s) rather than referring to an
event. The restricted verbs will be referred to as ‘minor’ verbs. The unrestricted verbs
will be referred to as ‘major verbs’. Aikhenvald (2006) refers to these two types of SVCs
352                                       CHAPTER VIII
with the terms SYMMETRICAL and ASYMMETRICAL respectively. In my description of Abui, I
adopt these terms systematically.
         In Abui asymmetrical SVCs, the minor verb either precedes or follows the
major verb, distinguishing two subtypes of asymmetrical SVCs (ASVC). This is
illustrated in as illustrated in (11). In the first column, the minor verb l ‘give’ precedes a
number of major verbs. The verb l ‘give’ has a grammatical function of expressing
benefactive (human) participants (for examples see 8.4.2.4). The verb kanri ‘finish’ is
the minor verb in the second column. It serves to express that an event has been
completed (for more examples see 8.3.1.1). Note that for the ease of presenting the full
glosses are omitted:       MINOR MAJOR                                       MAJOR    MINOR
(11)   -l       takei    ‘bite s.o.’                     nee      kanri    ‘finish eating’
       give     bite                                     eat      finish
       -l       tahai     ‘search s.o.’                  yaar     kanri    ‘finish going’
       give     search                                   go.CPL   finish
       -l       feng     ‘injure, murder s.o.’           feng     kanri    ‘kill’
       give     injure                                   injure   finish
       -l       luk      ‘massage s.o.’                  mar      kanri    ‘finish cooking’
       give     rub                                      cook     finishIn an ASVC, ordering of the major and minor verbs is grammaticalized. Therefore a
distinction will be made between ASVC.I and ASVC.II. In ASVC.I the minor verb(s) follow
the major verb(s). As discussed in 8.3, the minor verbs in ASVC.I express something
about the event properties such as aspect, manner, direction of the event, or mood.
        In ASVC.II the minor verb(s) precede the major verb(s). The function of the
minor verb is to express the participants or describe event settings, as will be discussed
in 8.4. The position of the minor verb with respect to the position of the major verb
corresponds to the positions of aspectual markers, arguments and adverbs within Abui
clause. In a monoverbal clause, arguments and adverbs referring to the settings of the
event precede the verb. The aspectual markers and negation always follow (for details
see 6.4.1).
        In Abui, there is a number of SVCs that display properties of both types. In
these SVCs, a number of verbs of ‘equal’ status combine with one or more major verbs.
These SVCs usually occur in narrative texts. The intonational properties of the SVC
complex are those of a monoverbal clause; the complex also is under scope of negation.
Such SVCs must be treated as ‘hybrid’ SVCs because they do not fit in the dichotomy
symmetrical vs. asymmetrical but have properties of both types. An example of a
‘hybrid’ SVC is given in (12). The verbs top ‘drop’ and taha ‘put on’ combine in an
ASVC.II. Both verbs share their arguments tut ‘shore’ co-indexed with the LOC prefix on
topi ‘drop’. They share the argument kapal loku ‘boats’ co-indexed with the distributive

prefix on topi ‘drop’ with the first verb marang ‘come up’. The verbs marang ‘come
up’ and top ‘drop’ combine in a symmetrical SVC:(12)    kapal loku o             marang         tut       tah-a

        ‘the boats disembarked on the shore’                                            [B05.029.01]Hybrid SVCs do not have a specific grammatical function. They seem to be ad-hoc
formed constructions depending on the pragmatic decisions of the speaker. Therefore I
will not report ‘hybrid’ SVCs in a separate section. Instead, I will point them out in
various sections.
        Finally, there is a final remark to be made about the correlation between the
shared aspectual inflection and the compositional properties of a SVC. The verbs
combined in asymmetric SVCs share always their aspectual inflection. The inflection
appears on the final verb of a SVC regardless its ‘status’, hence, in ASVC.I, aspectual
inflection is attached to the minor verb, and in ASVC.II, aspectual inflection is attached
to the major verb. However, in symmetrical SVCs and hybrid SVCs the aspectual
inflections do not necessarily have to be shared by all verbs.","[374, 375, 376]"

constructions. As illustrated in 5.6, many verbs may occur in more than one
construction. There is a tendency for bound stems to occur in A-UPAT transitive
construction. Free verb stems typically occur in the other three transitive constructions.","[268, 269]"

3.2.4    Relation between semantic and distributional properties of nouns
In Abui, semantic properties of nouns, such as animacy or individuation, are in relation
to their distributional properties. In general, actors are animate. They are realized with
NPs and co-indexed with the free pronoun di (3A). This is illustrated in (19) where the
NP naana ‘older sibling’ combines with di.(19)    naana        di na-wel
        older.sibling 3A 1SG.PAT-pour
        ‘my older sibling bathes me’                                                  [B01.032.08]Inanimate referents may be identified as a force and realized as the A argument of a
verb. As illustrated in (20), the force timoi foka ‘big wind’ is co-indexed with the
pronoun di (3A) as the A argument of the verb -lák ‘break’. Note that the free pronoun
di (3A) combines exclusively with A arguments.(20)    timoi foka        di lik          fala        ha-lák
        wind      be.big 3A platform house 3II.PAT-break
        ‘the big wind broke the house and verandah’                                   [B06.011.02]Both animate and inanimate participants may be identified as undergoers. In general,
animate and human undergoer participants are realized in more complex constructions
than inanimate undergoer participants. This is illustrated in (21) where the verb bol ‘hit’
combines in (a) with an inanimate undergoer realized as the NP wó kanai do ‘the canari
                                     GRAMMATICAL CATEGORIES                                            75
nuts up there’. In (b), the verb bol ‘hit’ combines with a human undergoer Arjun. This
participant is identified as a benefactive and expressed as the U argument of the verb l
‘give’ and co-indexed with the LOC prefix he- (3II.LOC). The verb l ‘give’ is
grammaticalized to encode benefactive participants.(21)    a. he-kuta                   wó        kanai           do          bol
             3II.AL-grandparent DIST.H canari.nut            PRX         hit
             ‘his grandfather hits the canari nuts up there’
        b. Mai Fan Arjun               he-l            bol
             name        name          3II.LOC-give    hit
             ‘Mai Fan hits Arjun’Another semantic property of nouns is individuation. It has been suggested in the
literature (cf. Gentner and Boroditsky 2001) that nouns differ in their ontological status
ranging from prototypical objects such as ‘man’ to prototypical substances such as
‘water’. This scale is referred to as ‘Individuation Continuum’ (cf. Gentner and
Boroditsky 2001:230). Prototypical objects in languages such as ‘man’ or ‘father’ are
individuated. Prototypical substances such as ‘water’ or ‘wood’ are not individuated. In
Abui, the feature [±individuated] is manifested in the asymmetrical use of the quantifier
loku (PL). 3 The quantifier indicates a plural number of individuated referents. It is
ungrammatical to use the quantifier loku with typical mass nouns such as bataa ‘wood’.
This is illustrated in (22).(22)    a. bataa                                       b. *bataa loku
             wood                                            wood        PL
             ‘wood, forest, trees’The quantifier loku may not be used with nouns referring to small animals, typically
occurring in large groups such as fikai ‘ant sp.’; this identifies them as mass nouns.(23)    a. fe     loku               b. mutang         loku         c.     *fikai   loku
             pig PL                       bee          PL                  ant      PL
             ‘pigs’                       ‘bees’Mass nouns can be individuated when they combine with a numeral. Numerals
contribute the feature [+individuated] and can make nouns such as bataa ‘wood, forest,
trees’ countable. Another related strategy is the use of a modifier noun such as tuku
‘piece’. The semantics of the noun tuku ‘piece’ describes the shape of the substance
and helps to conceptualize it as a [+individuated] object. This is illustrated in (24).","[97, 98]"
"(4)    NP Æ       (DEICT) (NPOSS PROPOSS-) N (NMOD) (ADJ/V) (QUANT) (DEM)Optionally, an NP may be modified by a modifier linked to the head noun with the
linker ba (LNK); typically, a relative clause (RC). The linked modifier may either precede
or follow the head noun as illustrated in (5). It forms a single intonational unit with the
modified NP. In (a), the modifier clause precedes the head noun bataa ‘wood’. In (b),
the modifier clause follows the head noun. The second order is more common.(5)    a. {no-pa                 mi-a}RC      ba     [bataa do]NP       ha-fik-i

ARGUMENT REALIZATION. In Abui, argument realization is semantically based.
Controlling and volitional participants of an event are identified as actors. Actors are
realized as A arguments with NPs and/or free pronouns. This is illustrated in (6). In (a),
the A argument is expressed with the NP maama ‘father’ and the free pronoun di (3A);
in (b), the A argument is expressed by the free pronoun di (3A).",[37]

this case no actual ‘holding’ occurs, as the people are only ‘driving out’ the deer. In the
construction the ‘driving out’ is nevertheless expressed as if the people ‘hold’ the deer
and ‘push him out’:(107) ama      wó mia              ayut ha-d-a               ring-r-a ba   sei

      ‘the people are up there and drive the deer out to come down’      [B05.007.02]In (108), the verb d ‘hold’ occurs as a single predicate or as a major verb in serial verb
construction. It is linked with the intersective linker ba (LNK) to the next clause
expressing the purpose of ‘being with’ somebody. These examples prove the verbhood
of the stem d ‘hold’.(108) a. moku ba [latukoi dakun-i]RC ha-d-o                         ba    yaa ha-wel

‘hold, get’ is to express a participant attributed a certain property. This SVC will be
referred to as ‘attributive’. The attributed participant is realized as the U argument of
the minor verb d ‘hold, get’ with LOC prefix in an ULOC intransitive construction (see
6.2.4.3). The minor verb is inflected with the punctual suffix -o (PNCT)The major verb
expressing the attribute belongs to the stative-verb, positional-verb, and index-verb
class. Consider now (109) where the stative verb kawaisa ‘be rich’ is illustrated.(109) a. e-d-o                kawaisa                          b. *a     kawaisa

           ‘Simon, he is rich’                                    ‘Simon is rich, or rich Simon’The participant attributed as ‘being rich’ may not be expressed with a free pronoun as
illustrated in (b), as only participants identified for actor role may be realized with a free
pronoun. Instead the attributive SVC must be used, given in (a). The participant is
realized as the U argument of the minor verb do ‘hold, get’ with the LOC prefix. This
holds for the speech participants, expressed with the first and second person. Third
person participants are either expressed as a NP in simple monoverbal clause (d) or as a
bound pronoun in attributive SVC (c). In (110), the verb do ‘hold’ is serialized with the
locational verb mi-a ‘be in’.(110) di sei                 he-d-o                    mi-a       ba     ha-kil

the complement clause wer-i ya kil ‘it is noon and empty’.(111) [wer-i       ya   kil]CC       ba     [he-d-o             wi-d-a

of the attributive SVC. In narrow-focus construction the domain of the focus is limited
to a single constituent, in this case one of the arguments. The normal position of the
focused constituent is preceding the minor verb d ‘hold, get’. It is expressed as the U
argument with the LOC prefix in an ULOC intransitive construction (see 6.2.4.3). The
minor verb combines either with the punctual suffix -o (PNCT), or with the imperfective
suffix -e (IPFV). These combinations are phonologically required as the generic root d
‘hold, get’ is not a prosodic word. An example with the minor verb d-o is given in
(114):(114) e-d-o                     taa, ne-d-o               na-rui-d-a

realized with the LOC prefix. The same holds for the second clause where the verbs do
‘hold, get’ and ruida ‘wake up’ are serialized. The connection with the attributive SVC
is still quite obvious. Compare now the previous construction with a parallel
construction in (115) where both participants are not under focus but are expressed
with a free pronoun. Observe also the use of the serial construction with ng ‘see’ to
express the participant of ‘waking up’ (8.4.2.1).(115) a      taa, na=ng          na-rui-d-a

The minor verb d-e ‘hold, get’ is used to focus on an actor constituent stressing that the
actor is still to perform an event. As illustrated in (116), the focused participant is
expressed with the LOC prefix on d-e ‘hold’. This argument shared with the major verbs

clause.16 This position is marked by an pause in intonation that follows the focussed
constituent. This pragmatic structure may interact with the focus SVC. The minor verb
and its U argument are extracted from the core of the clause (realized as contiguous
SVC) and placed in the clause-initial pragmatic position. An NP can be extracted to the
focus position without leaving any pronominal trace. This is illustrated in (117) where
the NP kawen ‘machete’ occurs clause-initially.(117) kawen     ama       mi bataa                  tukong

pragmatic position and also in its original position. An example of such construction is
given in (118):(118) [ne-d-o,]nominal     na pa                          pi-afu          tahai       yo

focus pronoun, just like the form ne-d-e. The pause in intonation between nedo and na
in (118) may be used as evidence supporting such an analysis.17 In my analysis, I choose16 The left edge of the clause is a typical location of focussed constituent also in other Papuan languages, as
argued by Donohue (2005:187).
17 In fact, a similar construction occurs in the neighbouring language Kabola (cf. Stokhof: 1987:647) where apronoun combined with a morpheme -ri, which is analyzed as a case marker, may be fronted to a pragmatic
position as illustrated in (2). Interestingly, the morpheme -ri may be combined with the inceptive aspectual
marker so.

Example (3) illustrates that an interesting alternation in Kabola. The accusative case marker can be replaced
with the morpheme ng, which is not further specified for its meaning. In both cases, the inceptive aspect
marker so is obligatory.

for the analogy between the attributive SVC and focus construction and analyse the
form ne-d-o as a verb phrase that appears in the clause-initial pragmatic position. As
illustrated in (119), the pragmatic position has a nominalising effect on the verb phrase
occurring in it. The pragmatic position marks any constituent appearing in it as given.
The resulting nominal ne-d-o has a lot in common with pronouns. The pragmatic
position does not allow free pronouns, which cannot be extracted from the clause.(119) [ne-d-o,]nominal      na       yaa buku afenga=ng yaa,                      melang afenga= ng

Also in this fragment, the fronted VP seems nominalized and is marked by a pause in

followed by the free pronoun a (2SG).(120) eh, Karfe Hawa-e, [e-d-o,]nominal         a te-salimang-d-i-a             do!

pragmatic position. The stem do ‘hold’ should not be confused with the anaphoric
demonstrative do (PRX), as illustrated in (121). Anaphoric demonstratives do not
combine with pronominal prefixes, unlike nouns, verbs and numerals.18(121) a. [he-d-o,]nominal   di ayong                        b. *he-do,               di ayong

   8.4.2.3     SVC with m ‘take, be in’
The generic verb m is glossed either as ‘take’ or ‘be in’ depending on the grammatical
context in which it is used. The decisive factors are the type and animacy value of its
arguments. In contexts where the minor verb combines with an animate A argument it
is glossed as ‘take’, in other contexts as ‘be in’.","[406, 407, 408, 409, 410]"

3.2.2        Categorial indeterminacy
There are a number of ambiguous lexical items that are identified as nouns or verbs.
The ambiguity is resolved by the syntactic context in which the items occur. Consider

           ‘while people were dancing, the two were eating their betel nut’    [B02.087.08:17]The lexical item luuk in (8) is identified a noun in (a) because it combines with the
possessive prefix and serves as an argument of the verb wida ‘become like that,
resemble’. In (b), the form is identified as a verb because it combines with a single
argument expressed with the noun ama ‘person’. In both cases the form luuk is
followed by the anaphoric demonstrative do that marks the end of a domain. In (a), do
(PRX) marks the end of an NP. In (b), it has a nominalising function, it marks the end of
a clause that serves as background information for the second clause.
        Another ambiguous item is tur, illustrated in (9). Both examples are taken from
a narrative. In (a), the form tur refers to a ‘spoon’ that fell out from the house and
must be picked up again. In (b), the form tur is used as a predicate ‘scoop up’ and
combines with the U argument is fat ma ‘cooked corn’.(9)    a. ah, na        sei               tur       mi=se         yo!

relation between their two meanings in the sense that the noun refers to a U argument
of the verb in a very broad sense. The semantic relations may be described in pairs such
as undergoer/result-activity, instrument-activity, location-activity, and entity-property

the syntactic and morphological context, in which they occur. The presented data
suggests that Abui sides with Austronesian languages in categorial indeterminacy and
not with Papuan (cf. Foley, 1998:509, 512; Himmelmann, 2005:126-131), which
normally have a strict division in nominal and verbal categories.1
3.2.3      Distributional properties
At the word level, nouns are characterized as either free or bound roots that may
combine with pronominal prefixes (for an overview of pronominal inventory, see
section 3.3). Pronominal prefixes serve to express possessors (for a detailed discussion
of possession, see section 4.2). Nominal morphology is restricted to the possessor
marking by pronominal prefixes. Other inflections such as for number, case, class, or
gender are not found in Abui.2
        Two free roots combined with pronominal prefixes are given in (16). The
pronominal prefixes belong to set I, glossed as AL(inenable) below. The free root feela
‘friend’ combines with pronominal prefix ne- (1SG.AL). The free root maama ‘father’
combines with pronominal prefix he- (3II.AL):(16)     ne-feela                ‘my friend’                         he-maama           ‘his father’
         1SG.AL-friend                                               3II.AL-fatherBound roots combine with pronominal prefixes from set III, glossed as INAL(ienable)
below. As illustrated in (17), the bound roots –táng ‘hand’ and wei ‘ear’ combine with
pronominal prefixes na- (1SG.INAL) and ha- (3II.INAL) respectively.(17)     na-táng                 ‘my hand’                           ha-wei             ‘his ear’
         1SG.INAL-hand                                               3II.INAL-earThere is a distinction between the nouns in (16) and (17). The nouns in (17) obligatorily
combine with the pronominal prefixes that express a possessor (see section 4.2.2). The
nouns in (16) combine optionally with pronominal prefixes (see section 4.2.3).
       Nouns never combine with pronominal prefixes from set II, glossed as
REC(ipient) below, which may only be attached to verbs. In (18), this restriction1 Categorical indeterminacy is a typical feature of Austronesian languages. As discussed by (Foley, 1998)Austronesian morphology is typified by the roots that ‘exhibit categorical indeterminacy, i.e. a given root can
be used nominally or verbally without derivation by being head of syntactically nominal or verbal
construction’ (Foley, 1998:509). However, ‘the roots in Papuan languages show a sharp division into nominal
and verbal categories and can only change via morphological derivation’ (Foley, 1998:512). Another Papuan
language that shows similar categorical indeterminacy is Sulka. This language has been in long-termed contact
with Austronesian languages (Reesink, 2005:145) which resulted in sharing the typological feature of
indeterminacy with AN languages (Reesink, 2005:163).
2 The lack of case and number inflection of nouns is claimed to be a common feature among other Papuanlanguages (Foley, 1986:93-96) as they rather employ verbal affixation to signal case relations.

7 The term ‘labile’ has a broader applicability that the terms such as ‘middle’ or ‘ambitransitive’. The term‘middle’ refers to verbs such as ‘break’. In intransitive construction, the subject of these verbs is a patient (cf.
Payne 1997:216). The term ‘ambitransitive’ is used for closed sets of verbs that can be used transitively or
intransitively. (cf. Nichols et al., 2004:153).

However, it is impossible to analyse all of them as regularly derived compounds: the
semantic contribution of their head (the final generic) is elusive, and it is difficult to

relate it to how it is used in other paradigms. In other words, the overall morphological
function of particular generic verbs can only be spotted by comparing their function
across various sets of paradigms (cf. the sets discussed above, and the ones to be
discussed in the sections below). But even then, the patterns are not always regular and
semantically transparent, and there are many paradigms with lexical gaps.
         Other generic roots are used with very low frequency in the final position. The
generic root f ‘sever’ encodes events of separation such as ‘steal’, as illustrated in (34),
k-o-f- ‘cut off’ that alternates with k-o-i ‘cut’ illustrated in (87), or -yong-f- ‘forget’. In
(92), the order of the generic roots is reversed. Interestingly, also the semantics of the
CV is reversed. The CV t-e-k refers to downwards motion of ‘sliding’. The CV k-e-t
refers to the upwards motion of ‘prodding’.(92)   t-e-k      ‘slide; dry’, lit.: ‘bring to start lying’ t-e-t-          ‘slid on’
       lie-move-bring                                        lie-move-lie

       bring-move-bring                                     bring-move-lieThe use of the CVs given in (92) is illustrated in examples (93)-(96). In (93), the CV t-e-
k is illustrated. It refers to an event oriented away from the DC. The event is described
as ‘lying down’. The verb refers to the ‘cutting’ and ‘rolling down’ of the weed in the
garden. In this way the garden is cleaned, the weed is consequently burden, and new
crop planted.(93)   na      yaa    ne-ut              t-e-k
       1SG go        1SG.AL-garden [lie-move]-bring
       ‘I go to work in my garden’, lit.: ‘I go to make lay (the weed in) my garden’ [B01.035.32]In (94), the completive CV t-e-t refers to a similar event. The ‘stone wall’ kota collapsed
during an earthquake and slid on a man. The person buried under the stones is realized
with an NP ama kang nuku ‘one man’ and co-indexed as the recipient/goal with the
pronominal prefix ho- (3II.REC). Because the event is completed already the CV stem is
followed by the perfective suffix -i (PFV). The original final root k ‘bring’ is replaced by
the root t ‘lie’.(94)   ama      kang       nuku       kota ho-t-e-t-i

from DC. The CV combines with two arguments, the A argument is realized with the
free pronoun di (3A); the U argument is realized with the NP baleei wataka do ‘the
banana blossom’. The referred event is a motion towards a ‘banana blossom’ that is
best translated as ‘prodding to’. It is the reversed motion from ‘sliding’ or ‘rolling
down’.

event of poking out that precedes eating. The U argument is expressed as the NP
nemáng ‘shells’ that is co-indexed with the prefix he- (3II.LOC).(96)        na     wi        ha-kok-u              nemáng        tahai     ma-r          kan-r-i

‘rolling down’ as it is when ‘fruit-prodding’ is referred to.
         The Table 25 gives an overview of event types as encoded by the final generic
verb. Note that the generic verb u ‘leave’ is ambiguous as it may be interpreted as a
perfect suffix or as the head of a complex verb; the distinction is not always clear.","[351, 352, 353]"

interpreted as a clause chain where the first two clauses express the event setting and
the following clause the event that happened. Another option is to consider the
predicates akun ‘be dark’ and falak-d- ‘get bright’ as secondary predicates that serve as
adverbial modifiers. In what follows I give an overview of a number of predicates that
refer to the temporal settings of an event.   6.3.3.1     tuntama ‘night’
The nominal predicate tuntama ‘night, be night’ is used to express that an event occurs
in the night. Its use is illustrated in (187).(187) tuntama       di ko    me
      night         3A soon come
      ‘he will come tonight’Sometimes, it is not clear whether the nominal predicate tuntama ‘night’ should be
analyzed as an adverbial or as an argument. In (188), the NP tuntama ‘night’ and the
coordinated NPs ía ‘moon’ and fír ‘star’ combine in a U-U transitive construction (see
6.2.3.1) with the verb mi ‘be in’. The noun tuntama ‘night’ expresses the (temporal)
location of the celestial bodies. This phrase serves as a complement of the verb ng ‘see’
expressing a location. The generic verb ng ‘see’ is conjoined with falakda ‘become
bright’ in an allative serial construction (see 8.4.2.1).(188) tuntama ía         e fír mi=ng           falak-d-a          adi ho-ng        mi-a

NPs headed by the noun war ‘sun, day’ that contain a quantifier (an ordinal or cardinal

   6.3.3.3      tung ‘year’
The noun tung ‘year’14 combines with numerals and other predicates such as ran ‘reach
at’, afe ‘pass’ to refer to a year. This is illustrated in (190).(190) a. ran            tung nuku di                me
         reach.at.CPL year        one         3A    come

In (191) the adverbial modifier indicating the length of an event is formally a clause
consisting of the VP ayokda ‘get two, become two’ that combines with a single
argument expressed with the NP tung ‘year’.(191) ama       he-l           tai       tung ayok-d-a

  6.3.3.4     kor bai ‘in a while’
The predicate kor bai ‘in a while’ indicates that an event is expected to happen very
soon. The predicate is formally a clause consisting of the ko ‘soon’ that combines with
the verb r ‘reach’ and the confirmative marker bai verb glossed here as ‘say’.(192) ko-r          ba-i      tuntama                di me

  6.3.3.5    ding kang ‘probably’
The predicate ding kang indicates that an event might possibly occur. In fact the ding
kang consists of free pronoun di (3A) combines with the generic verb ng ‘see’ that
forms a SVC with kang ‘be good’ as illustrated in :(194) [di=ng kang]adverbial ne-kariang do                   he-ahama          do    it-i

8.4.7.2. It occurs in the clause-initial position and is followed by adverbs and
arguments. It seems plausible to argue that in contexts as (195) the adverbial predicate
ding kang has been lexicalized to an adverb with meaning ‘probably’:(195) [ding kang]adverbial anui ko      sei
      probably                rain soon come.down.CNT

   6.3.3.6    akun ‘be dark’
The completive verb akun ‘be dark’ indicates the location of an event after some period
of darkness. In (196), an adverbial phrase containing akun ‘be dark’ occurs between the
A argument of the clause and the VP we ‘leave’. The phrase consists of the verb mi ‘be
in’ that refers to a location the darkness, and serves as a complement clause of the
generic verb ng ‘see’. The generic verb ng ‘see’ combines with the completive stem
akun ‘be dark’ in allative serial verb construction (see 8.4.2.1). The adverbial phrase
mi=ng akun could be literally translated as ‘darkened into (it)’.(196) a       [mi=ng akun]adverbial phrase        we?

‘see’ to refer the time after a previous period of darkness, which is ‘this morning’. It
combines with the verb maran ‘come up’. As in the previous example, the deictic verb
la ‘be.MD’ serves as a complement of the verb ng ‘see’ which combines in allative serial
construction with the verb akun ‘be dark’.","[293, 294, 295, 296]"

word. Generally, free roots, illustrated in (i), are found in all grammatical categories.
Free and bound roots that combine with pronominal prefixes (ii, vi) are either nouns or
verbs. Only verbal roots combine with both pronominal prefixes and aspectual suffixes
(iii, iv, vii). Stems that consist of two roots, of which one is bound, are interpreted as
verbs.
          In Abui, verb stems may display stem alternation. This is illustrated in (5), where
a number of stems show an alternation in their rime. The alternation affects either the
coda, as illustrated in the first and second row, or the nucleus, as illustrated in third row
where no coda is present.(5)    mok              ~    mop                      buuk        ~          buut

completive stems (CPL) refer to an event that has a final point. The inceptive stems (ICP)
choose the opposite perspective; they refer to an event that has an initial point. The
70                                             CHAPTER III
stem alternation is a typical morphological characteristic of the verbal category. It is
discussed in detail in sections 3.4.2.3 and 6.1.1.1 as an aspect marking device.
        In Abui, a number of bound roots cliticize to free forms to form a prosodic
word. They are aspectual particles te (INCP.C), se (INCP.I), si (PHSL.I), and ti (PHSL.C), and
the bound root ng ‘see’. As illustrated in (6), these forms can be characterized as
enclitics, as they are always attached to the preceding prosodic word.(6)     a. pi        làk-i=te                         b. moku loku sakola=ng yaar-i

        3.2      Nouns3.2.1        Semantic properties
The grammatical category of nouns contains items that refer to time-stable concepts:
persons, objects, places, and substances (cf. Payne, 1997:33; Schachter, 1985:7; Anward
et al., 1997:173). In Abui, the words given in (7) are identified as nouns, as they share
these semantic properties.(7)     feela                   ‘friend’                            maama            ‘father’        Ata Pula                ‘name of a person’                  Fan Ata          ‘name of a person’        Ateng Melang            ‘village name, lit.

semantic as many items that are in some contexts identified as nouns (typically with
non-human referent) may also refer to events. Instead, the grammatical category of
nouns is identified by its distributional properties (see section 3.2.3).","[92, 93]"
"MORPHOLOGY. Abui can be characterized as an agglutinating polysynthetic language.
Nouns tend to be morphologically simple; the possessive inflection is the only nominal
inflection. Verbs tend to be morphologically complex; they are inflected for person and
aspect. In (2), I give an overview of morphological structures found in Abui. Words
consist minimally of a free root (i). Free roots may combine with optional morphemes,
prefixes (ii), suffixes (iii), bound roots (iv), or both prefix and suffix (v). Free roots may
form a complex stem with a bound root and still combine with affixes (vi). A number
of roots are bound; they obligatorily combine with prefixes (vii), suffixes (viii), or both
of them (ix), other bound roots (x), bound roots and suffixes (xi), or all of them (xii) to
form a word.

Abui distinguishes open and closed grammatical categories.
Open grammatical categories are only nouns and verbs. Closed grammatical categories
are adjectives, deictics, quantifiers, aspectual markers, linkers, adverbs, and question
words. There is a closed set of generic verbs which are monosegmental roots and have
a number of grammatical functions in argument realization and verb derivation.","[35, 36]"

          1.3      Abui community
The term ‘Abui’ is an Abui word that means ‘mountains’ or alternatively ‘enclosed
place’. This term is also used in local Malay to refer to Abui speakers who refer to their
language as Abui tanga ‘mountain language’ and to themselves as Abui loku ‘the
mountain people’. In Abui oral tradition (cf. Nicolspeyer, 1940; Djeki, 1986, my own
records) Abui people settled in Alor in ancient times and did not find other settlers
there. Later some of them moved to the Kabola peninsula. The same tradition accounts
that they dwelled in caves in the mountains in the Mainang area. In this area also some
rock art is found. They refer to neighbouring tribes as ‘younger siblings’ or as ‘new
arrivals’. However, the oral tradition in Alor serves too often as a political instrument.
The oral tradition has not been verified by archaeological research yet.
        Abui speakers are mainly farmers, just like other inhabitants of Alor. However,
in mountainous areas hunting and gathering is also an important supplement to the
staple diet of corn, cassava, and rice.3 In the coastal areas, which are less favourable for
agriculture, many farmers have switched to fishing, the traditional activity of the
Austronesian population. Traditional livestock are pigs and chicken. However, livestock
seldom supplement the diet due to frequent swine fever and poultry diseases. Thus, the
diet is not well balanced, often resulting in poor health conditions and anaemia,
especially among children and women. In the mountainous areas the situation is better
as traditional hunting provides a more balanced diet. The mountains also favour a
number of important cash crops such as coconuts, coffee, cloves, cocoa, cashew nuts,
candle nuts, vanilla and tobacco. These provide the farmers with additional income,
which results in generally better living standards than for people in the coastal areas.
        Educational facilities in the Abui area are limited to elementary and secondary
schools in district capitals. The nearest university is in Kalabahi, which offers limited
training in economy, law, English and computer science. The more significant
educational institutions are found in Kupang, the provincial capital of NTT.
        In the interbellum period, the Abui community was studied by scholars Cora
Du Bois and Martha M. Nicolspeyer. Cora Du Bois was a psychologist who spent two
years in Ateng Melang (a.k.a. Atimelang), carrying out psychological research focussing
mainly on the personality structure of Abui people and the relationship between
personality and culture. She is considered to be one of the founding scholars of this
subject, together with Sigmund Freud, Edward Sapir, Abram Kardiner and others. The
research that Du Bois carried out among Abui people resulted in the monumental
monograph The People of Alor (Du Bois, 1944; 1960). Du Bois’ colleague, Martha M.
Nicolspeyer, accompanied Du Bois during her research in Ateng Melang and published
a dissertation about the sociological structure of Abui society (Nicolspeyer, 1940).",[26]

4 Note that for some Abui kinship terms are relative to the ego and gender of the possessor. The form ura
refers to a sibling of the opposite gender than the possessor. The form muknehi refers to a sibling of the same
gender as the possessor. For the terms naana ‘older sibling’ and nahaa ‘younger sibling’ the age of the
possessor is relevant.

to with the noun pong ‘face’, as illustrated in (34):(34)   a. lik          ha-pong                     b. melang         ha-pong

           ‘frontside of a veranda, platform’           ‘frontal side of a village, seawards side’In (35), the body part nouns mina ‘side’ and bang ‘shoulder’ are given. In (a), the body
part noun mina ‘side’ refers to the side of an object or to juxtaposition of two objects.
In (b), the noun bang ‘shoulder’ indicates an elevated flat position:(35)   a. kadera       ha-mina                  b. melang       tama      ha-bang

           ‘side of a chair’                       ‘village on the sea shore’    [B07.047]In (36), the body part nouns -táng ‘hand’, -wa ‘mouth’ refer to parts of vegetal bodies
or parts of object that display some analogy with human body such as the edge of a
mortar in (b).(36)   a. bataa      ha-táng                            b. natu        ha-wa

           ‘branch of tree’                                  ‘the upper edge of mortar’Note that these constructions cannot be considered as compounds but as regular
possessive constructions because the first noun of the construction may be modified.
This is illustrated in (37), where the noun bataa ‘wood’ is modified with the stative verb
foka ‘be big’.(37)   bataa foka         ha-táng
       wood be.big 3II.INAL-hand
       ‘branch of a big tree’In (38), the noun ièng ‘eye’ is used to refer to the centre of objects:(38)   masang        h-ièng                        ye     h-ièng

       ‘back side of two trees’                         ‘backside of a book’In (40), the noun ui ‘back’ does not require possessive inflection when the possessor is
inanimate (a). The location of the human participant referred to as di (3A) is expressed
by the complement clause fala ui hiéng ‘see the back of the house’. This clause is the U
argument of the verb mia ‘be in’. It encodes disappearing of the participant expressed
with the free pronoun di (3A). In (b) the animate possessor de-ya ‘her mother’ must be
expressed on the noun ui ‘back’. Note that the verb h-iéng ‘see it’ expresses orientation
of the location (a) or movement (b). For more details see 8.4.2.1.(40)   a. di        fala      ui      h-iéng         mi-a           nai-d-i

specify a standard measure unit of trade commodities. The noun h-ièng ‘its eye’
indicates a hand-full quantity of commodities such as betel nut, tobacco, or small fish.
For commodities such as corn, the noun ha-táng ‘hand’ is used; it refers to 140 corn
spikes.(41)   fu           h-ièng                                 kafaak h-ièng            sua

       ‘one handful of dried fish’                         ‘bunch of corn, 140 pieces’Note that the constructions given in (41) cannot be analyzed as compounds because the
body part can be used on its own once the commodity is mentioned or obvious from
the context. The commodity can be expressed by a bare noun or by an NP, such as afu
takata ‘dry fish’.","[169, 170, 171]"
"  8.4.2.1       SVC with ng ‘see’
The generic verb ng ‘see’ occurs as a minor verb in SVCs encoding three related
grammatical functions. (i) In allative SVCs it expresses the goal location of a movement
or activity. (ii) In purpose SVCs it serves to express the purpose of an activity. It is, in
fact, expressed in the same way as the goal location in time, with the difference that
‘purpose’ is encoded as a specific argument with the LOC prefix as the U argument of
the minor verb ng ‘see’. (iii) The third function is different. The SVC is used to express
an experiencer. The ‘experiencer’ component is contributed by the semantics of the
minor verb ng ‘see’. The A argument of the minor verb ng ‘see’ expresses the non-
volitional actor of the whole construction. These three functions are discussed in turn
below:14 The monosegmental roots such as ng ‘see’, d ‘hold, get’ etc. are identified as verbs in Abui, because carryaspectual and person inflection and have the ability to derive new verbs from non-verbal roots, as discussed
in chapter 7. Cross-linguistically, adpositions inflecting for person are not found frequently, a know example
is Irish (cf. Noonan 2001; 2004). However, the other properties of the Abui roots indicate their verbhood.

ALLATIVE SERIAL CONSTRUCTION. The first function of the minor verb ng ‘see’ is to
express the goal location of a movement. I will refer to this type of construction as
‘allative SVC’. The semantics of ng ‘see’ contains the direction component necessary to
refer to a goal.15 The goal location is realized as the U argument of the minor verb ng
‘see’. The A argument is shared by both serialized verbs. The allative SVC is
contiguous: no constituent may occur between the minor and major verb. The major
verb is usually a verb of motion or position. An example is given in (85) where the
‘allative’ SVC is contrasted with the monoverbal clause. In (a), the minor verb ng ‘see’
combines with the U argument ya ‘water’ that is interpreted as the goal location of the
motion expressed by the second verb. In (b), the verb sei ‘come down’ occurs in the A-
ULOC transitive construction. Its U argument is expressed with the LOC prefix he-
(3II.LOC) referring to the NP ya ‘water’. The U argument is interpreted as a specific
location, in this case a purpose.(85)    a. na ya=ng               sei                       b. na         ya      he-sei
             1SG water=see come.down                              1SG water 3II.LOC-come.down
             ‘I come down to water’                               ‘I come down for some water!’Note that the minor verb ng ‘see’ does not meet the requirements of the minimal
prosodic word. Therefore it forms a single prosodic word with its argument. In case of
a full NP argument, the minor verb combines with the last constituent of the NP such
as demonstratives, quantifiers, adjectives and state verbs (see also 4.4.5). The U
argument of the minor verb ng ‘see’ may be realized as a bound pronoun (pronominal
prefix). An example is given in (86). In (a), the major verb yaar-i ‘go’ combines with ng
‘see’. The U argument of the minor verb wata ‘coconut’ is specified by the REC prefix
on the verb. The REC prefix refers the NP wata ‘coconut’ that is interpreted as
[+individuated]. In result, the construction refers to motion to the ‘top’. In (b), ng ‘see’
is serialized with the verb mit-d-i ‘seat, get sitting’ to add the location argument
expressed with the NP kuda ‘horse’ and co-indexed with the REC prefix ho- (3II.REC).(86)    a. a         wata      ho-ng         yaar-i
             2SG coconut 3II.REC-see go.CPL-PFV
             ‘you climbed a coconut palm’

             3A horse     3II.REC-see sit-hold-PFV
             ‘he mounted the horse’, lit.: he got seated on the horse’                     [B07.056.02]In (87), ng ‘see’ is serialized with rarak ‘shake’. The U argument of the verb ng ‘see’ is
the NP adi ‘sky’, which is co-indexed with the REC prefix ho- (3II.REC). It expresses the
goal location of the construction, a location to which the hand is shaken.","[399, 400]"
