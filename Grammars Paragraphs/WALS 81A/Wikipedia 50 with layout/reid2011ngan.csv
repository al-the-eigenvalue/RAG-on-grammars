          Summarising stress patterns in Ngan'gityemerri:
          -We have seen that simple (monomorphemic) nouns, and ‘simple
verbs’ (those consisting minimally of ‘subject-auxiliary root' sequences)
have a syllable-timed stress pattern with primary stress on the first syllable
and secondary stress on the third syllable if it is not word-final.
      -Complex nominals, such as reduplications and compounds, have a
morpheme-timed stress marking pattern.    We also noted that as ‘simple
verbs' became increasingly complex (i.e. as direct and indirect object bound
pronouns were suffixed to the ‘subject-auxiliary root’ sequence), then
secondary stress began falling on the initial syllable of the pronoun, rather
than the third syllable (see 2-99). I noted that for morphologically complex
words there seems to be a preference for allocating stress marking in a way
that reflects morphemic constituency.
        - For complex verbs though, I find that stress is neither syllable-timed,
 nor morpheme-timed, but falls on the initial syllables of the auxiliary and
 the CVS, regardless of their syllabic or morphemic constituency.            Put
 another way, stress patterns in the Ngan'gityemerri verb have the
 synchronic function of signalling the boundary between the auxiliary and
 the CVS. In a fixed-ordered, synthetic/agglutinative verbal structure, why
 shouid there be this higher-level grouping of a string of morphemes into
“two ‘halves', and why should this have such saliency for the application of
 stress rules? The Ngan'gimerri data collected by Laves (1931) provides a
 historical viewpoint that suggests an explanation. A detailed comparison of
 the verbal structures exemplified in Laves' Ngan'gimerri data and my own
 data on contemporary Ngan'giwumirri, can be found in Reid (to appear).
 Just a brief suminary is given here.
         The 1931 Ngan'gimerri data suggests that the. precursor to the
 contemporary Ngan'gityemerri verb structure, was a phrasal verb,
 consisting of a ‘finite verb’, and a freeform ‘participle’ (that shared at least
 some features of nominals). These two major elements of the phrasal verb
 appear to have formed separate phonological words. They could be ordered
 variably with respect to each other, and verbal enclitics could be copied onto
 both elements of the phrasal verb. Compare Laves' example below where
 the first word corresponds to the contemporary auxiliary, and the second
 word to the contemporary CVS.","[125, 126]"
"       Other than the 10 simple verbs then, all Ngan‘gityemerri verbs are of
the complex type, consisting of the two major units, the auxiliary and the
complex verb stem. The complex verb constitutes a single phonological
word (having only a single primary word stress, cf. 2.5.3) and’ is typically
ordered with the verb stem following the auxiliary, as in 3-2 and 3-4. There
are however two subclasses of verbs that are ordered inversely with the verb
root preceding the auxiliary. These subclasses are:
1      The verb 'to want/like’' formed with the 'Hands' auxiliary, e.g.       3-5          derrigidi- wurrmum-ngi
               want        - 3plHands   -1sg
                        SU Pres   DO
               They want/like me.",[129]
"    5.5    Phonological Status of Bound Class Generics
            All the freeform generics listed in Table I function as independent
    phonological words. Here I am more concerned with the phonological
    status of the bound generics which are split between prefix and proclitic.
    This distinction is based on the ordering of phonological processes in
    Ngan'gityemerri and results in different levels of phonological dependency
    operating between the host nominal and the bound class generic.
           Cliticisation is a late-ordered process in the sense that clitic
    attachment to a nominal root takes place after all other phonological
    processes - stress assignment, assimilation, vowel harmony etc. Proclitics

        The identity of an actor can require clarification where any of three
pragmatically determined conditions hold. Firstly, where the subject and
object of a verb are both 3rd person singular, or both 3rd person plural, the
bound pronominal morphology on the verb does not suffice to adequately
track participant identity. This is especially true where there are switches in
the identity of subject/object roles and freeform nouns or pronouns in
either role are free to appear in any order with respect to the verb. In 6-3
below the object of the first clause wa-wunu 'that man’, is the agent of the
transitive verb in the second clause and this switch in role is disambiguated

         Yityi!- differs in word class status from the other interrogatives in

"2.1.2  Diphthongs
       Of the four Ngan'gityemerri vowels, e,a and u are subject to
diphthongisation in certain environments. The environment that triggers
this process varies for each vowel, and none of the resultant diphthongs are
phenemic. The following discussion of diphthongs as conditioned
allophones rightly belongs then, in the previous section 2.1.1. They are
treated separately here purely for clarity.
       As is common in Australian languages, phonetic diphthongisation
primarily affects back vowels. In Ngan'gityemerri these three vowels can be
ranked in terms of the frequency of, and the number of environments in
which, they diphthongise, in the order a>u>e. The low front vowel is only
minimally diphthongised, and in only a single narrowly defined
environment.       The high front vowel is not audibly subject to
diphthongisation at all. As all diphthongisation is triggered by articulatory
preparation for laminal tongue configuration in the following consonant,
this ranking accords with our expectations, in the sense that it is ordered
inversely to the qualities of tongue height and frontedness that are
associated with the quality ‘laminal'’.
       In Ngan'gityemerri we find the diphthongs [at] and [ot] occurring
word-finally.   Patterning these diphthongs with the behaviour of back
vowels occurring before the laminal consonants ty, sy and ny, we analyse
them as sequences of /at+ty/ and /uty/ respectively.      /af    —     [at]    -before any syllable-final laminal.                   2-11     abatymirri          blackduck     [abatcmui]

implications for the occurrence of diphthongs. As real appreciation of this
requires some understanding of classmarking and vowel harmony,
discussion of these implications is deferred to 2.4.4.
        In conclusion then we note that all diphthongs in Ngan'gityemerri
are allophones of the vowel phonemes, conditioned by following laminal
consonants. This conditioning laminal is more likely to be syllable-final
rather than syllable-initial, and more likely to be the semivowel y than the
stop ty, fricative sy, or nasal ny.
        The domains of the four vowel phonemes, their allophones and
conditioned diphthongs, are demonstrated in Figure 2-1 below.

       In addition to the 21 auxiliaries discussed so far, the Ngan'gityemerri
auxiliary system includes a subgroup of ten auxiliaries that are the
detransitivised reflexes of established auxiliaries4. While there are few
formal similarities, in terms of their semantics each of these ten auxiliaries
can be linked to one of the auxiliaries we have already examined. Three are
reflexes of the bodypart instrumental auxiliaries 'Hands', ‘Feet' and
‘Mouth’. Five are reflexes of the instrumental auxiliaries ‘Poke’, 'Bash',
‘Shove’ and ‘Heat’. The remaining two are reflexes of the 'Say' and ‘See’
simple auxiliaries.
       The ‘detransitivising’ nature of these auxiliaries requires some
comment. All verbs employing these auxiliaries are formally intransitive,
being unable to cross-reference their undergoers as direct objects. Being
primarily reflexes of major instrumental auxiliaries (‘Hands', ‘Feet',
‘Mouth’, ‘Poke’, ‘Bash’, ‘Shove’ ‘Heat’ etc.) verbs formed with these
detransitivised auxiliaries involve activity by the subject that is directed
towards a part/whole of him/herself. This reflexive interpretation of
detransitivised auxiliary selection is shown in the following two examples.
4-265, contrasts ‘Shove’ with 'ShoveDtr'. In 4-265 b) it is the whole of the
subject that is also the 'undergoer' of the activity. 4-266, contrasts 'Hands'
and ‘HandsDtr'. In 4-265 b) it is a part of the subject that the activity
expressed in the verb is directed towards.4-265 a)         ngudum -fel            ball             b)   = ngudeny’-=_ -fel

auxiliaries that are ‘of the reflexive type'(Walsh 1989:2).   As is the case in Ngan’gityemerri,
it seems that in Murrinh-patha the encoding of reflexitivity is handled in two separate
ways;    inherently within the subclass of reflexive auxiliaries, and by overt morphological
marking on those verbs selecting the remaining auxiliaries. It is unclear whether the
Murrinh-patha ‘reflexive’ auxiliaries are the reflexes of major transitive auxiliaries as
they are in Ngan‘gityemerri.

"          Secondly, the compounding of nominal roots, and the attachment of
enclitics to nominal roots, can potentially result in the ordering of
contiguous vowels. Such occurrences are rare within noun phrases and
impossible within the verbal complex because Ngan’gityemerri morphology
is generally constructed of CV(C) syllables. Wherever two nominal roots
forming a single phonological word, be it through compounding (as in 2-79
    a
a) or encliticisation (as in 2-79 b), end and begin with i and a respectively,
then i is deleted. Consider the examples below.
       2-79 a)        kuri - apukek      -—    kur-apukek
                                              water-under

                                              before now
Given the limited distribution of morpheme-initial vowels in
Negan'gityemerri, note that ita is the only possible ordering of contiguous
vowels within a single phonological word.2.4.3.2      rV Deletion
         An examination of the Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr
auxiliary verb paradigms (see appendices A and B), shows evidence of a
general aversion to the occurrence in contiguous syllables of the apical stop
/d/ and continuant /r/. Where these are ordered in consecutive syllables,
the syllable containing the continuant will be deleted. e.g. -dVrV- — -dV-.
By way of example, the underlying and surface forms of the Ist, 2nd and 3rd
singular and Ist dl inc, present tense forms of the ‘sit’ auxiliary are given
below.                                    ngirim          I'm sitting.
                                    yirim           You're sitting.

Note that in their preverbal positioning manner adverbs may be
indistinguishable- from qualitative adjectives. To example 1 above therefore,
we can add another possible translation -'He's telling the story properly’.
        Particles, treated in chapter 7, generally precede the particular -
construction over which they have operational scope. They are normally
ineligible for any kind of nominal or verbal inflection, however clause
initially the negative particle minbe/minde(K) frequently attracts such
verbal enclitics as the temporal focus marker -nyine/-kana(K) and the past
and future tense markers, -tye and -pe/ -ngini(K). 6 b) is therefore an

"             Regardless of whether a transitive verb belongs to the punctual or
      neutral class, in the absence of any overt morphology specifying its internal
      temporal constituency, its unmarked form is conceptually perfective in the
      sense that it is perceived of as a single event. Examples 3-226 and 3-227
      above,  for instance, though the first is neutral and the second punctual, are
      expressed as single events with no information given regarding their
      aspectual make-up. To this extent, 'perfectivity' can be said to be the
      unmarked aspectual category in Ngan'gityemerri.
            Imperfective/progressive aspect is encoded in transitive verbs by the
      serialisation     of   the    intransitive    posture   /   motion   auxiliaries.
      Morphologically, these serialised auxiliaries function as enclitics to the
      complex verb stem. Phonologically, as their morphological status might
suggest, these enclitics are assigned no primary stress, and fall within the
pitch contour assigned to the verbal complex as a single phonological word.
       Serialised auxiliaries must fill the final slot of the verb following the
tense markers. In this respect Ngan'gityemerri contrasts with Marrithiyel, a
neighbouring language that also marks imperfective aspect on transitive
verbs through the strategy of serialised posture/motion auxiliaries. In
Marrithiyel the major tense/mood suffixes shift rightwards from the
transitive verb to appear on the post-posed intransitive auxiliary (Green
1989:175). The ordering of these serialised auxiliaries as the final element of
the verbal complex in Ngan'gityemerri, further stands as a counter-example
to two of the general claims made by Foley and Van Valin about the
relationship between aspectual operators and the verb nuclei over which
they have scope.       Foley and Van Valin (1984::210) claim that aspect is a
nuclear operator while tense is a peripheral one. They argue that this
difference in scope is reflected in ordering constraints in those languages
that mark tense and aspect as separate inflectional categories. Quoting
examples from Kewa (Franklin 1971) and Tiwi (Osbourne 1974) they note
that aspect is always marked closer to the verb nuclei than tense, and add
that 'they know of no cases of the inverse ordering in which tense is closer
to the stem than aspect'(Foley and Van Valin 1984:210). In contradistinction
to this claim Ngan'gityemerri clearly marks tense closer to the verb nucleus
than imperfective aspect. This is demonstrated in 3-228 below, where the
Past tense enclitic -tye immediately follows the verb root, and is in turn
followed by the serialised 'Sit' auxiliary.       3-228 wanni_      -batybity-tye -winni      warrgudu

"2.5.1  Stress on Mono-morphemic Nominals
        Stress placement on monomorphemic nominals and free form
grammatical particles and postpositions is relatively straightforward. They
bear primary stress on their initial syllable, and secondary stress on every
second subsequent syllable unless that syllable is word-final. The final
syllables of a mono-morphemic nominal can never bear stress.          2-95   fépi                     rock, hill

2.5.2.1      Reduplication
       In Ngan'gityemerri reduplication of verbal roots is a widespread and
productive process, but reduplication of nominal roots is essentially
restricted to a finite number of words, mostly animal names, derived
through onomatopoeic representation of their cries.
      Nominals are always reduplicated in full rather than partially, and
such reduplication involves the copying of full stress marking onto both
elements.

Only monosyllabic and disyllabic stems have been found to reduplicate in
Ngan'gityemerri. There is no obvious reason why stems with a greater
number of syllables would be precluded from this process, but as no
examples have been found, we have no need to consider how secondary
stress may have been treated in reduplications.
          Although the examples in 2-96 above now formally have the stress
characteristics of two phonological words, they cannot sustain a pause
between them, and they behave as single words in respect of such
grammatical criteria as their occurrence with nominal enclitics (2-97 a) and
noun class proclitics (2-97 b).          2-97    a)    watkuwatku-ninggi

       Compounds are like reduplications in that grammatically they
behave as single words. However, unlike nominal reduplications which
bear primary stress on each of the reduplicated elements, compounds have
the stress pattern of single phonological words, in the sense that they bear a
primary stress and subsequent secondary stresses. Stressmarking on
compounds, though, differs from that on simple nominals by being
morpheme-determined rather than syilable-determined.
          The    dimorphemic       compounds    in the following     examples   carry
primary stress on the initial syllable of the initial morpheme, and then
secondary stress on the initial syllable of the second morpheme, without
regard to the syllable count between stresses.          2-98   pi - piri            brain        wantyirr- finy | armpit sweat
                 head = pus                        armpit      sweni
                 firr - ngari         toenail      tyéri - windi     ear wax
                 foot     shell                    ear = wax
                 yénggi-dawan         smoke
                 fire    - smoke
Note that in the first two of these examples, monosyllabic initial
morphemes have resulted in contiguous stressmarked syllables.         This
stands in direct contrast to monomorphemic nominals where secondary
stress always falls on the second subsequent syllable.
        Compounds containing reduplicated elements follow the patterns
established separately for compounds and reduplications. Where the word-
initial morpheme is reduplicated, each element bears a primary stress and
the other elementi. of the compound bears secondary stress, as in 2-99.
Where the initial element of the compound is unreduplicated, it bears the
primary stress and each of the reduplicated elements bear secondary stress,
as in 2-100.      2-99   milm{fl-ma            cosmetic stick (for scraping skin etc.)
      2-100 muy-fintyifintyi       a crook (stick with a barbed fork for pulling
                                                          branches within reach)       Other than those containing reduplications, tri-morphemic
compounds are rare in Ngan'gityemerri, and the few examples that I have
collected show variation in their stress marking. Example 2-101 a) below
carries primary stressmarking on the initial syllable of the initial
morpheme, then secondary stresses on the initial syllables of the second and
third morphemes. This appears to be the normal pattern for lexical
compounds, each morpheme bears a stress on the initial syllable. However
2-101 b), which differs only in the initial morpheme, has been recorded both
with this expected stress pattern, and also with initial and second
subsequent syllable stress, as though it were a simple nominal. With the
corpusof trimorphemic compounds so small, it is difficult to know what to
make of this variation.      2-101 a)     bi - madi - mi                      back of thigh

2.5.2.3         Stress Marking on Classmarked Words
          Section 5.5 details the conditions under which the bound noun class
generics function as either proclitics or prefixes. The implications of this
distinction for the application of vowel harmony and diphthongisation
rules were examined in 2.4.4.1. This section examines the implications of
this same phenomenon for the marking of word stress.
       Where class generics function as proclitics, they are phonologically
independent of their hosts (cf. 5.5). Their hosts, which may be simple
                                                                                                 ete:

 23At least one exception to this statement is the word for ‘policeman’ - wamumu , coined by
 prefixing mumu - ‘taboo', with the male class-marker wa-, which carries stress on the class-
 marker. This is not an example of a stressed proclitic, as wamumu appears to have been
 lexically re-analyzed as a baseform. As supporting evidence for this re-analysis we find that
 a'policewoman’ is not a wuremumu, but a wurewamumu.

                      SUPres redup      On the other hand, bound noun class generics function as prefixes to
those hosts that have no freeform status. The hosts to generic prefixes can be
simple nominals, reduplicated nominals and compounds. Obviously they
cannot be complex NP's or verbs, as these are always independent units. As
prefixation precedes stress marking, these generic prefixes are therefore
interpreted as part of the phonological word for the purpose of stress
placement. The generic prefix, as the initial syllable of the phonological
word, now carries the primary stress. Secondary stress is determined in the
manner described in sections 2.5.1 to 2.5.2. For simple nominals, secondary
stress falls on the second subsequent syllable, unless it is word-final, as in
2-107.    On reduplicated nominals, secondary stress is copied onto both
elements, as in 2-108. And in the case of compounds, secondary stress falls
on the initial syllable of the second subsequent morpheme as in 2-109.

by an adjective, demonstrative or pronoun, the class generic will be copied
onto that modifier as a proclitic. i.e the same class generic can be both prefix
to class member terms, and proclitic to their modifiers.         2-110 4 -kulémbi          a-kérre             a big water rat

also the clitic copying rule, are ordered subsequent to stress assignment.
Within a dynamic morphological model we could thereby order these
operations in the following way.         prefixing > stress placement > clitic attachment > clitic copying
 2.5.3     Word Stress on Verbs
        The structure of the Ngan‘gityemerri verb is described in detail in
 chapter 3 and has been briefly sketched out in 2.4.4.2. Readers are referred
 to either of these sections for definitions of ‘auxiliary’ and 'complex verb
 stem’, and for descriptions of the constituency of these elements of the verb.
        The discussion below looks firstly at the stress placement rules on
 ‘simple verbs ', then ‘complex verbs’, and concludes with some comme:s
 about the function of stress marking patterns within the synchronic verb
 Structure.","[116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121]"
"The type of strictly syntactic incorporation presented here shows different
characteristics to the incorporation in languages discussed by Mithun (1984).
Using Mohawk as an example, she argues that all predicates bearing
incorporated nouns are lexicalised, regardless of how productive the process
may be.
                       "" NI may appear to be a syntactic process simply because of its tremendous
                       productivity; the number of combinations that occur seems unlimited.
                       However, speakers are keenly aware of the lexical status of all such
                       combinations. They know not only which constructions are possible, but also
                       which    of        these   actually   exist--ie.    which      are    lexicalised.        They
                        immediately recognise those which are not.                     Speakers           immediately
                       remember who uses a word not used by others, even when it is a perfectly
                       transparent combination of two highly productive stems.”                 |
                                 $              Having made this claim that speakers of incorporating languages remember
              all combinations of 'incorporated noun + verb’ as a lexicalised unit, Mithun
              uses this as a basis to draw a distinction between noun incorporation and
              other truly . syntactic processes. Speakers of non-incorporating languages,
              she argues, do not remember all possible combinations of verb and object.
                      Although            any     claims     about        the     degree      of          lexicalisation     of

 Bey
            _ impressionistic,
                             the examples like those in 3-275 a) - e) above suggest that in
              Ngan'gityemerri at least, bodypart incorporation can be a purely syntactic
              process. In fact Mithun indirectly acknowledges this possibility in the
              discrepancy between “constructions which are possible, and those that
              actually exist -ie. which are lexicalised""(loc. cit.). In Ngan'gityemerri,
              bodypart-verb root combinations that ‘exist’ (ie. are lexicalised) can be
              negatively tested for in terms of the criteria productivity and optionality.
              Likewise those combinations that do not ‘exist’, in the sense that they are
              not lexicalised, can be distinguished by their full syntactic productivity.
              There seems to be no real basis to say of these types, as Mithun does, that "" If
              speakers use a new combination, they are creating a new word and are aware
              of the fact"" (loc. cit.).
                     It should be pointed out that this distinction between syntactic and
             lexical incorporation in Ngan'gityemerri is purely based on the grammatical
             criteria of productivity and optionality. No attempt has been made to draw
             lines,   based     on         the    intuitions      of      native      speakers,            between       those
             combinations that 'exist' and those which do not. My own experience of
             exploring the productiveness of bodypart incorporation with informants
             suggests that no such clearcut lines exist. The degree of productivity
             brought to the incorporation of bodyparts is a stylistic variable that some
             speakers exploit more than others.      Combinations which are rejected
             outright as not ‘existing’, can always be found to ‘exist’ where a sufficiently
             imaginative       mind         can establish a plausible context.                            In fact it is the
exploitation of the more marginal ‘non-existent’ combinations        that is
widely held to be the mark of someone who is ‘good with words’.
       Variation in the perception of the degree of lexicalisation of some
combinations would be anticipated if the incorporation of bodyparts is an
evolving process.     This is particularly true where, as Mithun notes,
lexicalisation develops from noun + verb combinations that are, in cultural
terms, especially nameworthy.
       Lexical    incorporation,   on   the other    hand,   differs   from   syntactic
incorporation in not being productive. While there are many instances of
the same verb root compounding lexically with different bodypart terms, as
in 3-282, this is not to be confused with productiveness. Lexical
incorporation is a compounding process that derives a new verb root from
the combination of a bodypart and a verb root. (eg. Bodypart - Verb root 1 ->
Verb root 2).       3-282 a)       ngibem-tyeri-baty (*detyeri)

remains unmotivated as both of these alternatives attribute the status of an
underlying form to the unmarked realisation, when in reality we have no
real criteria, distributional or otherwise, upon which to base such a
judgement.
       The 'bodypart' and ‘animal’ class prefixes are the only two that are
subject to metaphony. All other classmarkers fail to show any variation in
their realisation, regardless of the quality of V; of any nominal root to
which they may be attached, and regardless of whether, as discussed in 5.5,
they function as prefixes or proclitics.      2-83          wa - yedi (K)(*weyedi)                   man                                      (*mamuy)           yam

       Note also that where the 'animal' bound class generic is copied onto
modifiers of class members, it functions as a proclitic, not a prefix (cf. 5.5). As
a proclitic it remains phonologically independent of its host, and is
therefore unaffected by the vowel harmony process. This is demonstrated
in 2-84 below.      2-84   e-melpe        a-yeyi          another stingray

We can therefore conclude, assuming a dynamic model for morphology,
that vowel harmony is ordered after prefixation but before procliticisation.
        Having established that a subset of bound classmarkers have been de-
cliticised and function as prefixes, and having noted the implications of this
function for the process of vowel harmony, I will return to the implications
of this same opposition for the process of diphthongisation. This discussion
has been deferred from 2.1.2.
       The examples in 2-85 are ‘animal’ class member terms. On the
nominal roots, each beginning with 'ye-', the ‘animal’ classmarker a-
functions as a prefix (as established above). The examples in 2-86 are
modifiers of ‘animal’ class members (also beginning with ‘ye-') and
therefore copy the classmarker as a proclitic not a prefix.      2-85   a-yerrsya                   bush cockroach      _[atjerfa]

2-86, it is evident that the classmarker a- is subject to diphthongisation
where it functions as a prefix, but is blocked from this process where it
functions as a proclitic. This accords with the different levels of
phonological dependency operating between prefix/proclitic and host, as
discussed in 5.5.     We can conclude then, that the process of
diphthongisation, like vowel harmony,          is ordered after prefixation but
before procliticisation.
      We can further see, comparing 2-85 and 2-86 with 2-84 above, that
diphthongisation precedes and blocks the application of the vowel harmony

"        Laves'    division   of the elements    of the phrasal     verb   into   two
 phonological. words, accords perfectly with our division of the same
 elements in the contemporary fixed-constituent structure into auxiliary and
 CVS.    In Laves' data bound object pronouns are suffixes to the ‘finite verb’,
whereas in contemporary Ngan'gityemerri they are suffixes to the auxiliary.
Likewise in Laves' data, the applicative prefixes fi- and mi- are incorporated
bodyparts    attached   to   the   ‘participle’,   whereas   in   contemporary
Ngan'gityemerri they are prefixes to the verb root. In Reid (to appear) I
suggest that within the last few generations the Ngan'gityemerri verb has
undergone radical change. The ‘finite verb’ and ‘participle’ found in Laves'
data, which functioned as separate phonological words, developed a fixed
ordering and were ‘glomped' together into a single phonological word.
Verbal enclitics can no longer be copied onto both elements, as in 2-125
above, but are now attached to the complex verb unit.
       If we accept that the ‘finite verb’ and ‘participle’ of the phrasal verb
were separate phonological words, we can further presume that each of
these two words would have borne primary stress on its initial syllable. In
the contemporary Ngan'gityemerri verb, where these two ‘halves' have
been collapsed into a single phonological word, this pattern is essentially
retained with primary and secondary stresses falling on the initial syllables
of the auxiliary and CVS respectively. In conclusion then, the ‘salience’ of
the boundary between the auxiliary and the CVS for the application of stress
rules in contemporary Ngan'gityemerri can be accounted for in terms of the
structural developments that the verb has (only recently) undergone.

 3.1.1 Simple and Complex Verbs
      There are two types of verb in Ngan'gityemerri: simple and complex.
These are defined with respect to the constituent units ‘auxiliary’ and
‘complex verb stem'. The presence of an auxiliary is a factor common to
both verb types, though simple verbs consist minimally of just an auxiliary
and are characterised by the absence of a complex verb stem.
       The ten auxiliaries that form simple verbs are likewise referred to as
‘simple auxiliaries’. The ‘simple auxiliary’ 'sit', forming a simple verb, is
demonstrated in 3-1.          3-1   ngirim

     Structure of Examples
              Examples are structured as four lines. The first line is the
     Ngan'gityemerri sentence/word in bold script. Loanwords are treated in
     one of two ways. English loans which essentially retain their English
     phonemicisation and meaning are given in the first line of examples in
     plain rather than bold script, to denote their status as loan words (or in some
     cases, code-switching). Loans from English which have been phonemicised
     into Ngan'gityemerri, or have acquired new or extended meanings as
     loanwords are given in bold script and provided with an interlinear gloss on
     lines two and three (i.e. in accordance with Ngan'gityemerri speakers’
     perception of such words, I have treated them as ‘proper NgK or NgW’).
     The second and third lines of examples, in italic script, provide an
     interlinear gloss. I've found the use of two lines necessary simply because of
     the morphological density of the verb in particular. Lines 2 and 3 are meant
     to be read jointly from left to right, rather than sequentially. For instance,
     the gloss to the example given below should be read as;                    wuddumbuny-ngerr -mi -wul        -nime-pagu
                    3pl Shove   -dl/1sg-Val-return- tr | -HITH

                    They (three) brought me back here.     ""third plural subject, ‘shove’ auxiliary in perfective inflection, portmanteau
     dual subject and first singular direct object, valence increaser, return (verb
     root), trial subject, hither directional”
              As evident in the above example, I use a slash / between the glossed
     elements of a portmanteau morpheme.          Another minor convention is the
     inclusion, below the verb root, of the meaning of the verb. This is given
     only in those verbs whose meaning is unpredictable from the combination
     of the auxiliary and verb root semantics.
Se
              Auxiliary roots are glossed by name (e.g. 'Shove' in the example
     above). The semantic nature of auxiliary verbs is discussed in detail in
     chapter 5, and readers seeking explanation of auxiliary root glosses are
     referred to this section. The 31 auxiliary names are listed below.","[20, 21, 22, 23]"
"6.1.5.2          Multiple Enclitics
          In Ngan'gityemerri the minor phenomenon of multiple case enclitics
is essentially restricted to combinations of the ‘local’ case forms, i.e. spatial
source -nimbi and either or both of the locative -nide (see 6.1.6) and the
directionals     -pagu and -pefi (see 6.2.2).          As -nimbi is almost always an
element of multiple enclitic constructions, they will be briefly dealt with
here.
        Where motion/transfer takes place, not simply from a location, but
from inside a location, then the NP designating that location will bear both
locative and source case enclitics in that order.          6-38   yarany      -fi -tit  musyulng-nide-nimbi

syllables generates triconsonant-clusters of the form C,V@2C;C,; VC2Cs.

2.4.2      Apical Assimilation
   _   Where morphological processes order the apical stops /t/ and /d/, or
the apical nasal /n/, after the apical flap /rr/, this process assimilates the flap
to the manner of the following segment. Assimilation of this kind produces
stop and nasal geminates that are contrastive with single stops and nasals
(see also the discussion of gemination in 2.2.2.2). This process does not
apply to every /rr/ + /apical stop~nasal/ cluster that results from
morphological processes, but applies in only two specific environments. Its
most frequent application is within the verbal morphology, at the juncture
between the subject number marker and the auxiliary root. Within
nominal morphology this process can be seen to operate at the juncture
between the ‘tree/thing’ classmarking prefix and its host. Each of these
environments is examined below.","[106, 107]"

alternative translation.

"       Given that these verbs are monovalent, and that the person and
number of the single argument is unambiguously encoded in the bound
subject marker, the occurrence of indirect object pronouns in the final
position of the auxiliary in reflexive/reciprocal verbs is essentially
redundant. It generally carries no new information (although note that -nge
in 3-99 does include gender information whereas the subject pronoun does
not), and can be included or omitted with no significant difference to the
meaning of the verb. The inclusion of bound indirect object pronouns in
detransitivised auxiliaries, may be largely governed by practical
considerations, such as distinguishing between those ‘transitive’ and
‘detransitivised'   auxiliaries   that are similar   in form,    like 'Bash'   and
‘BashDtr' in 3-100 and 3-101, which are distinguished only by the quality of
the auxiliary root vowel. Within the context of the harmonic processes that
regressively influence vowel quality in the verb complex (cf. 2.4.4.2), the
inclusion of the indirect object pronoun in 3-101 does serve to draw
attention to the ‘detransitivised’ (and therefore reciprocal) status of the
auxiliary.      3-100 ngerrben-@-lulu              3-101 ngerrbin     ngirr-lulu

5.1           Morphology of Nominal Classification
5.1.1         Descriptive Preliminaries
        The classification of nouns in Ngan'gityemerri into fifteen separate
categories is signalled through the use of both freeform and bound generics.
While most nouns can be assigned to at least one class, there are some
nouns, mostly terms for natural objects such as sun, rocks, ground, stars,                                  td
clouds etc. that belong to no overtly marked class. I have chosen to analyse
these as belonging to no class rather than to a sixteenth O-marked class; a
decision that carries no significant consequences.
       On the whole,       this system of noun classification is neither
homogenous nor internally consistent. Of the fifteen classes, six are denoted
by only freeform generics, five by only bound generics, and four employ
both bound and freeform generics. Furthermore, among the class categories
having bound generics, there is considerable diversity regarding the
phonological status of those generics (see 5.5), and the types of modifiers to
which they may be attached (see 5.3).
       Another important feature of the Ngan'gityemerri noun classificatory
system that will be treated here, concerns the grammatical status of the
mechanisms that signal class categories. As this has implications for the
terminology used in this section, I will begin with a review of Dixon's (1982)
comparison of the noun classification phenomena in Yidiny and Dyirbal.
       Dixon (1982: chpt 5-8) compares the different systems in Yidiny and
Dyirbal that have the semantic function of classifying nouns, and contrasts
the grammatical status of these two systems. He provides criteria for
determining whether a language has a system of noun classes (like Dyirbal)
on the one hand, or noun classifiers (like Yidiny) on the other.
       ""In summary, noun classes constitute a closed grammatical system, with a _
       finite (usually fairly small) and determinable number of choices involved;
       each noun belongs to one class and few (or none) will correspond to more than
       one class. Noun class is shown by morphological processes which can apply to
       the noun itself and must apply to some other constituent; they sometimes
       combine information about noun class and number, case or definiteness. The
       morphological process most often involves adding an affix or clitic to
       constituents of a number of specified grammatical types. Classifiers comprise a
       largish (often semi-open) set, whose members may not be exhaustively
       listable; each classifier is either a free form or else a root, to which a numeral
       affix or clitic may be added. Not every noun may take a classifier; many nouns
       may occur with one of a number of different classifiers, sometimes with a
       difference in meaning and sometimes not. Classifiers, but not noun classes, may
       be used in different ways in different speech styles within a language.""
                                                                                            coat

      Dixon goes on to speculate about the origins of these different
                                                                                               re
mechanisms in Yidiny and Dyirbal, suggesting both may have developed
                                                                                               ay
from a small set of about half a dozen classifiers.           The few classifiers in pre-
Yidiny were augmented to yield the larger modern classifier set, and those
in pre-Dyirbal developed into an obligatory morphological category of noun
classes. He does give examples of a few languages (Micronesian and
Athapaskan) which combine noun class and classifier features, but on the
whole he finds that the vast majority of ‘classifying’ phenomena fit the
criteria by which they can be labelled as either ‘noun classes’ or ‘classifiers’
(loc. cit: 226). In view of his speculation about the development of the
Yidiny and Dyirbal systems, he notes that those languages which show a
combination of noun class and classifier features (e.g. Mokilese) “may be in
the first stages of change into a grammatical system of noun classes""(loc. cit:
221).
       In light of the noun class versus classifier debate, it must be said that
the phenomena of nominal classification in Ngan'gityemerri (and probably
other Daly languages) do not fit these criteria well. As we shall see in the
following section, while the freeform generics have more of the features of
classifiers, and the bound generics have more of the features of noun classes,
none are good exemplars of either type. Despite this, to make the discussion
throughout this section as clear as possible, I have divided the fifteen
generics in Table 3 into three groups. Groups 1 and 2 have bound generics
and by this criterion are viewed as ‘noun classes’. Groups 2 and 3 have
freeform generics that are viewed as ‘classifiers’. Note that Group 2 has both
noun class markers and classifiers. The differing usages of these are
                                                                                    seat

appropriate sections of 5.2. Finally, I additionally use ‘noun classification’ as
                                                                                    oerpicksinms
a cover term for the system as a whole (i.e. embracing both noun classes and
classifiers).
        Noun classes are defined as those sets of terms whose membership
within a class is signalled grammatically by the attachment of bound class
generics, either to the member noun itself, or to nominals that may modify
it. For most of the 'noun classes’ examined in section 5.1.3 and 5.1.4 there
are identifiable subsets of nouns which do not bear class signalling prefixes.
For instance, while the vast majority of animal terms bear the a- prefix that
signals membership in the ‘animal’ class, e.g. a-matyi ‘kangaroo’, a few
cannot be classmarked in this manner, e.g. (*a-)wamanggal ‘wallaby'.
However the class membership of nouns like wamanggal is still formally
revealed through the attachment of a- to any adjective, pronoun or
demonstrative modifying them, e.g. wamanggal a-wedi ‘a little wallaby’.
Those class member terms that do not themselves bear class marking, but
which can be shown to belong to a particular class through this strategy of
modifier concord, are referred to as defacto class members. Throughout this
section all reference to formally defined ‘noun class' should be understood
to refer to the set of classmarked and defacto noun class members.
        It should also be kept in mind that disparities exist between formally
defined noun classes, on the one hand, and semantically defined classes on
the other. We require the notion of 'semantically defined class' to account
for, for instance, those bodypart terms like kekulkul ‘heart’ that do not bear
the bodypart ciass prefix. As the bodypart prefix is not attached to nominals
modifying bodyparts, kekulkul cannot be shown to be a defacto 'bodypart'
class member through the strategy of modifier concord.      Words like
kekulkul then, belong to the semantically defined, but not the formally
defined, ‘bodyparts' class.

"2Although not very likely, it is not impossible that further work will reveal additional
auxiliary verbs. Increasing fieldwork in recent years has resulted in the upgrading of
auxiliary counts in Marrithiyel (Green 1989) and Gamu/Matngeli (Harvey : to appear). The
actual numbers of auxiliaries in all Daly languages are probably considerably higher than
the figures given in Tryon (1974). The current figure of 31 for Ngan'giwumirri and
Ngan‘gikurunggurr is also an increase from the figure of 26 given for Ngan'gikurunggurr in
Reid (1982). The potential for auxiliaries to be missed by researchers stems primerily from
the occurrence of low frequency auxiliaries that may only combine with a single CVS. Any
residual auxiliaries in Ngan'gityemerri would almost certainly be of this type.
‘simple auxdliaries' share the capacity of ‘complex auxiliaries' to combine
with verb stems, and can, in addition,    stand on their own.
       Ngan'gityemerri    auxiliaries    then, constitute 31 unique     sets of
semantically based verbal inflectional categories, with which verb stems
combine.   The combination of auxiliaries and verb stems is, in the main, a
productive process. The extent of this productivity is an issue that we will
return to throughout this section. The point to be made here though, is that
auxiliaries do not form 31 rigid, mutually exclusive verb classes to which
verb stems belong. This view of auxiliaries, as found for instance in Tryon
(1974), implies some sort of logical linkage between the semantics of each
auxiliary and the semantic properties inherent in those CVSs which select
them. However it is not the case that each CVS selects a single auxiliary, or
can be said to belong to a single auxiliary class. The productivity of auxiliary
- CVS combination varies widely. While some auxiliaries are in fact only
found in combination with a single CVS, others select a wide number of
CVSs. It will become apparent from the discussion of each auxiliary later in
this section, that independent semantic characteristics can be attributed to
both auxiliaries and CVSs, and that the productive manipulation of these
characteristics supports the view that both auxiliaries and CVSs are separate
entities, each maintaining its own semantic integrity and having some
sort of psychological reality in the minds of Ngan‘gityemerri speakers.
        In order to present the Ngan'gityemerri auxiliary system in the
clearest possible way, we can divide the 31 auxiliaries up in terms of several
criteria. We have already divided the 10 simple auxiliaries from the 21
complex auxiliaries. They can be further divided in terms of whether they
are predominantly transitive or intransitive, and in terms of the degree of
productivity they bring to CVS combination. As a preliminary to this
investigation of the semantics of the Ngan'‘gityemerri auxiliaries, these two
issues, the transitivity of both auxiliary verbs and CVSs, and their degree of
productivity, are addressed in the following two subsections.","[243, 244]"
"      Lexical incorporation also differs from syntactic incorporation in that
bodyparts cannot be omitied from the verbal complex or appear as external
nominals, as evidenced by the impermissible freeforms in               3-282 above.
       The range of bodypart terms found in lexical compounds is
significantly smaller than those which incorporate syntactically. Whereas
any member of the bodypart noun class can be syntactically incorporated, it
is only those major bodypart terms listed in Table 3-8 that can compound
with verb roots to derive new verb roots.
        What then of the grammatical relations allowed to hold between the
bodypart and verb root members of a lexical compound ? The majority of
examples of lexically incorporated bodyparts fall within the general
restrictions on predicate relations given above for syntactic incorporation, ie
transitive objects and locatives, and intransitive subjects with certain
auxiliaries.    Other examples allow for a wider range of relations, including
some disallowed for syntactic incorporation. Thus in 3-282 above we find
bodyparts as part-of-S in verbs with stative intransitive auxiliaries.
Additionally we find lexically incorporated bodyparts being construed with
the subjects of transitive verbs, as in 3-283 below.         3-283          nga        enyi-tyerr     -pu-pe

"         The allomorphy of -yendi can be accounted for by the following two
rules.
         1)     _ Initial y is elided after non-stops, leaving a VV sequence.
        2) | Whichever V secondary word stress falls on is retained, the
               other is elided.
From the examples in 6-97 and 6-98 it is evident that the phonological
processes at work here are ordered in the following way.
                     suffixation > stress placement > elision
That -yendi attaches to its host prior to stress placement conflicts with the
general behaviour of class and case marking enclitics noted elsewhere. It is
on the basis of this factor, together with the propensity to undergo
elision/reduction, that -yendi can be seen to have the status of suffix rather
than enclitic.6.2.6  -gumu/gimi(K)      SEMBLative
       Glossed as SEMBL, the enclitic -gumu indicates that something
‘resembles’ the NP to which it is attached. As is evident in examples 6-100
to 6-102, -gumu typically co-occurs with the proclitic ngini-/ngani-(K)
'KIND' (discussed in 6.2.7 below).        6-100 knife-pagu ngini-kinyi-gumu yumu      _-ngiti-wa -pe wagarri

              (author being chastised for over-retroflexed articulation)        The role of -gumu-/gimi-(K) as a verbal enclitic is examined in 3.4.4.2,6.2.7   ngini-/ngani-(K)          KIND
        Of the class of clitics that have nominal, verbal and propositional
functions, ngini- stands apart in being the only proclitic. In fact, other than
the noun class markers (cf. 5.5) and relative location ngan- (cf. 5.3.4), ngini-
is the only productive proclitic in Ngan'gityemerri. This is of interest
because,    like     the    noun   class     markers,   ngini-   is also   concerned   with
classification.
       Ngini- can be attached to NP's, (where, as in 6-100 to 6-102 above, it
frequently co-occurs with the SEMBLative enclitic) indicating that some
entity is ‘of the same kind' as another. The controlling factors as to what
constitutes 'KIND', are typically context dependent; for example, in 6-100
above the speaker is requesting two knives with a thin curved blade,
unserrated and about ten inches long, like the one he is holding. He is
unconcerned whether they be the same brand or colour etc, rather his
concern is that they are the same kind of knife from a functional point of
view, i.e. that they are ‘skinning’ knives.
       However, ngini- also interacts with noun class generics so that
‘KIND' is understood to refer specifically to species within that designated
genus.       6-103 yerr-ngini-kinyi minbe derrigidi-ngerim

                                     Abstract           This thesis is a study of Ngan'gityemerri, a language spoken
  primarily in and around the two communities of Nauiyu Nambiyu and
  Peppimenarti in the Northern Territory.
           Chapter One provides an introduction to the names by which
  speakers of this language have been referred to, comments on the
  relationship between the two dialects, and establishes my use of the term
  Ngan'gityemerri as a language name. Also included in this chapter is a brief
  account of the history of these people since European invasion of their
  country began late last century, some comments on social organisation,
  cultural affiliations, Wangga and Lirrga songstyles, and a description of their
  country. The current status of the language is reviewed, and the language
  variety presented in this work is clearly identified. A survey of previous
  work on Ngan'gityemerri, and a description of my fieldwork methodology
  are additionally included.
           Chapter Two presents the segmental phonology, phonotactics, stress
  patterns and morphophonological processes. Particular attention, in the
  form of a detailed acoustic study, is given to the mechanism by which the
  contrast between two series of stops is maintained.
           Chapter Three presents an overview of ‘simple’ and 'complex' verb
  structures, then identifies the morphological make-up of the verbal
_elements labelled ‘auxiliary’ and ‘complex verb stem’. The mechanisms
  that interact to mark categories of tense, aspect and mood, namely auxiliary
 root inflection, verbal enclitics, verb root reduplication and the serialisation
 of posture/motion auxiliaries, are all addressed in this chapter. The
 incorporation into the verb of bodypart noun roots is also investigated here.
 A distinction between ‘lexical’ and ‘syntactic’ incorporation is invoked, and
 the differences in the effect of both these types of incorporation is dealt with.
 A list of incorporable terms is presented, and their literal and classificatory
 semantics explored.
          Chapter Four investigates the semantic contribution that the
 auxiliary makes to the meaning of a full verb. The 31 auxiliaries are broken
 down into six groups on the basis of their functional roles, which are
 described in detail.
          Chapter Five deals with the role played by both freeform and bound
 generics in classifying the Ngan'gityemerri nominal world. The
 morphology of these generics is surveyed with regard to the typological
 distinction drawn between ‘noun class’ systems on the one hand, and
‘classifier’ systems on the other. The semantics of noun class categories are
also examined here.
          Chapter Six examines the set of enclitics, some of which have scope
over NPs and others over clausal propositions. The semantic functions of
this clitic set vary widely, some marking such case-like roles as 'agent' or
‘instrument’, others encoding the kinds of meanings, like speaker attitude,
that are commonly attributed to free particles. The class of free particles is
treated in Chapter Seven.
          Chapter Eight provides a brief presentation of space, time and
number expression, and Chapter Nine deals with the freeform pronominal
system, demonstratives and interrogatives.
          Appendices to this grammar include the full subject-auxiliary
sequence paradigms for both Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr, as
well as four texts. Cassette tapes of the textual material included in the
appendices have been submitted with this thesis, and copies of these will
gladly be made available by the author to any interested readers.
                            Acknowledgments          Acknowledgments in theses tend to list personal debts after
 professional ones.     I'd like to make one of my personal debts most
 prominent, for the reason that neither language informants enduring
 laborious and uninsightful elicitation, nor supervisors plowing through
 copious draft chapters, make the personal sacrifice towards a Ph.D that one's
spouse does. Janet Douglas not only endured for four years the stresses
imposed by living below the poverty line, my prolonged absences on
fieldwork, and my preoccupation with topics beyond her own interests, but
at the same time bore our two children and developed her own art. She
skillfully trod the fine line between being totally supportive on the one
hand, and ensuring, on the other, that I understood that this had to finish. I
couldn't have done this without her.
         I'd like to express my gratitude to all the inhabitants of the
communities of Peppimenarti, Nauiyu Nambiyu and Wudi Gapil Diyerr for
the friendship and generosity they extended to me, for their tolerance of my
preoccupations and blunders, and for sharing with me their language and
way of life. To teach me NgW I have been particularly fortunate in being
commandeered by Robert Daly. Delighted to find a whitefella interested in
his language, he spent twelve months befriending me, teaching me, and
getting us both into trouble. As a gifted narrator, an enthusiastic and
perceptive polyglot, and a man with an extraordinary memory, he proved to
be an excellent teacher. He provided encouragement when needed, though
delighted in publicly chiding his ‘schoolboy’ , as he liked to call me. Widely
acknowledged as a superb didjeridu player, and master of a wide range of
song styles, he opened my eyes to the whole field of song language and
structure that my linguistic training had not prepared me to even consider
as ‘language’.
         Numerous other people at Peppimenarti have contributed towards
my understanding of Ngan'gityemerri, and been great friends. Special
thanks to Agala, Tyemeny, Tyarambu, Lunggu, Talungga, Wirigaty,
Maguraty, and Terry Sams.
         Molly Mafulenggit of Nauiyu Nambiyu checked my NgW data and
provided texts and data of her own, particularly with regard to zoological
and botanical taxonomy.
         Daisybell Malfiyin and Long Harry Barney also taught me some
NgW and confirmed the Laves' data as the Ngan'gimerri of rak-Merren.
Long Harry recorded for me his entire song repertoire.
           Patrick Tyabada provided some entertaining NgW texts, and was
 invaluable in site mapping rak-Lafuganying. And thanks to Old Tilmarr
 who gave me his sweat.
           My NgkK teachers were initially the late Topsy Parry, the late Mabel
 Kada, and Margaret Parry of Nawiyu Nambiyu and Wudi Gapil Diyerr.
 Later they included Martin Padu, Pincher McCann, Paul Tyekpity and
 Stephen Kundu of Peppimenarti, and Topsy Waya of Nauiyu Nambiyu.
           Harry Wilson, king of Peppimenarti, doubled the productiveness of
 my time there by ensuring that I never experienced the sense of security that
 might lead one to slacken off. At the same time he was generous with
accommodation      and supportive of my work. To him and Regina I'm very
 grateful.
           My entire time in the field was spent under the ‘parental’ guidance
 of Bill Parry, who always kept an eye out for me, introduced me to potential
 informants, kept me informed of local political developments, and was
 always ready with a cup of tea and a dirty story.
           At Daly River Mission Joseph Parry, Dianne Tchumut and
 Angganmerr have been terrific friends, and the Nauiyu Nambiyu council
 and mission staff have always been most kind to me, providing
 accommodation and other support when neccesary. At Peppimenarti the
 successive headmasters David Shute and Tony Crichton were always
 enthusiastic about my work and encouraged me to spend time teaching in
 the school. Other European staff at Peppi, Sue Crichton, Michelle Spencer,
 Kim   O'Donnell,   Kerry   Green,   Angelita   Martini,   and   Ruth   and   Glenn
 Rogers, provided an entertaining alternative social life, numerous
 kindnesses, and some fabulous meals. Visits to Peppi by Alan Marett during
 my 1988 fieldtrip first got me interested in the structure and language of
 song, and I enjoyed our joint investigations into these topics immensely.
          My interest in Australian linguistics was first fired by Bob Dixon, and
 as my main supervisor he was thorough and always encouraging. Harold
 Koch provided additional supervision, particularly with the final draft. I'm
 greatly indebted to Ian Green. He not only provided me with the
 opportunity to first engage in fieldwork, but discussions with him over the
 subsequent years and his detailed comments of early drafts, have
 significantly shaped my analysis of Ngan'gityemerri. Mark Harvey has
 proved to be a thorough commentator, and made numerous suggestions for
 improvements, particularly in the phonology chapter and the section on
 bodyparts. For additional comments on various parts of this grammar I'm
 grateful to Felix Ameka, Andy Butcher, Anne Dineen, Nick Evans, Phil
Rose, David Wilkins and particularly to Nick Piper who did the last minute
typo hunt.
        Alison Hoddinott and Frances Kofod graciously allowed me access to
the Hoddinott and Kofod grammar whilst it was still in preparation for
publication.
        In Canberra Ian Green, Nick Piper, Felix Ameka and Andy Butcher
forced me to drink four years of bad coffee, but also kept me sane. Thanks.
       Numerous    other friends   including   Pete   & Jay, Bill & Paul,    and
especially Alison & Dave, have been unstinting in their support.
         Fieldwork funding was provided by the ANU Faculties. The
AIATSIS kindly provided me with a vehicle for the '86 fieldtrip. When I
ungraciously wrote this off, Warwick Dix was extremely helpful in finding a
replacement vehicle for me.      For my '88 fieldtrip the AIATSIS again
provided funds which enabled me to hire a vehicle from NARU                 (who
additionaliy helped out with camping equipment).

of course none of them are responsible for the content.

 19There is one exception to this general statement that we have already encountered in
 example 2-40. Within the auxiliary verb, syllable-final -rr-, denoting non-singular subject
 number, assimilates to the the manner of auxiliary-root-initial -d-, e.g. nguddeny-fel ‘we (pl
ex) jumped’. This morphophonological rule is discussed in more detail in 2.4.2. Otherwise
 voice stops do not occur in syllable-final position.

                            -he
  In 2.3.2 we noted that 63% of all words are vowel final. From the
remaining 37% of consonant final words we can make the following
observations. The apical trill at 12.6%, and the apical nasal /n/ at 8.3%
account for over half of all word-final consonants. The pattern suggested by
these figures, that word finally non-peripherals are more common than
peripherals, is not borne out by the stops. The dorsal /k/ is the most
frequent final stop (3.6%), followed by the non-peripherals /t/ (2.3%) and
/ty/ (1.3%) Bilabial /p/, the least frequent (0.6%), appears finally in
nominals, only in the C2C3 cluster /rrp/, eg: ngurrp ‘emu’ and ferrp ‘often’,
and in a couple of verb roots, eg: wap 'sit', pap ‘climb’ etc, which in the
absence of verbal enclitics, can be word final.
        The continuant /r/ has only been recorded word finally in a single
Ngan'gikurunggurr word, and three Ngan'giwumirri words, adigar (W/K)
‘Australian pratincole', amugar (W) ‘bony bream' and awugur (W) ‘small
fish sp. used for livebait'. However it is found more commonly syllable
finally on a number of bound prefixes wur- ‘female’, ngur- ‘penis’ etc.
        The labiodorsal semivowel /w/ has only been recorded finally in a
single word, the exclamation (ka)kaw ‘come here!’. The possible elision of
a final vowel, or some other form of phonological aberration, would not be
particularly unexpected in a member of the imperative/ejaculatory
wordclass, however in this instance its occurrence is contrastive with a
vowel final word.      2-53         kaw                 come here!
                   kawu                dyadic kin term MM/DD       The occurrence of final /y/ needs to be established to account for word
final diphthongisation of /u/ and /a/.      2-54         wakay               finished     [wakat]
                   damuy               eye          [damot]}
The failure of /y/ to occur finally after front vowels prompts an alternative
analysis of the above forms as elisions of eg: /wakayi/ and /damuyi/.
However a wider examination of the lexicon shows that not all -ayi- and
uyi- sequences follow this pattern.          2-55         ngayi                I              [natji]
                       awuyi                possum         {awaji]
On the basis of this data, I interpret word final diphthongs as a sequence of
vowel + semivowel.         Semivowels are thus included in the list of
consonants appearing word finally though, as in many Australian
languages, their distribution is restricted to following back vowels only.","[98, 99, 100]"
"        The ‘unsatisfactory’ evaluation of a proposition (or, more especially,
an individual's role in a proposition), that is convey by -wurru, can interact
with the semantics of the verb and the general context of the discourse in a
way that leads to the interpretation of the speech act as an expression of
compassion or an expression of criticism. For instance, a -wurru marked NP
that is portrayed as the victim of some verb of adverse effect, as in 6-122, is
understood to be the object of the speaker's compassion. On the other hand,
a-wurru marked NP that is portrayed as the perpetrator of some adverse
proposition (or even potentially adverse proposition), is understood to be
the object of the speaker's criticism, as in 6-123.      6-122 minbe-wurru           kene          yannunggu-madiwirri

phonological words, and generally occurring clause-initially. Otherwise they
share broadly similar semantic functions to the enclitics discussed in the
preceding chapter. Wilkins (1989:347) has drawn attention to the ‘significant
degree of agreement between the stocks of meanings encoded through the
particle/clitic grouping’ in Australian languages generally. Most of the
particles discussed here have scope over an entire clausal proposition. The
three forms examined in 7.10 have the function of conjoining nouns and
clauses under certain, fairly limited, conditions. Particles cannot take any
form of inflection. 7.11 lists the class of interjections, which differ from
particles in constituting complete utterances on their own.","[382, 383]"

 3.2.3         Non-Subject Cross-referencing
 3.2.3.1                Direct and Indirect Objects
       In Ngan'gityemerri two types of non-subject argument are cross-
referenced in the final slot of the auxiliary with bound pronominal suffixes.
These categories of participant type are labelled ‘Direct Object’ and ‘Indirect
Object' (DO and IO in the example glosses). Before looking at the
morphology of these two sets of pronouns, I comment on the nature of
these categories of participant role.
       Other than the minor use of IO forms in reflexive verbs (see 3.2.3.4),
only higher animate participants are generally eligible for cross-referencing
with DO and IO forms. On the animacy hierarchy humans, spirits and
ancestral beings are placed high. On the other hand, insects, birds, mammals
etc clearly hold a low position.            Certain domesticated animals (dogs and
horses for instance) can be variously viewed as higher or lower on the scale,
perhaps not always qualifying for verbal cross-referencing, but clearly being
eligible where they are addressed as second persons, included in the
reference of first person forms, or within certain contexts play a sufficiently
salient role within a discourse that they need to be referenced within the
verb.
         Indirect Object forms cross-reference higher animates that are: the
implied locatives of intransitive motion verbs (3-76); the goals of speech act
verbs (3-77); the targets of cognitive and perceptual verbs® like ‘forget’ (3-78),
‘remember’, ‘recognise’, ‘listen’, ‘hear’; and entities that are the less affected
‘objects’, beneficiaries or goals of transitive verbs (3-79).
         Direct Object forms, on the other hand, cross-reference those non-
controlling patient-like participants that are acted upon by a transitive agent,
including the recipient of ‘give’ (3-80 to 3-83).
       It is the semantic nature of Ngan'gityemerri verbs that determines
whether they cross-reference participants with DO or IO forms. Although we
can make the general observation that DOs are highly affected patients, and
10s are less affected targets and goals, participants in a given verb cannot be
variously coded with either set of forms. That is, the difference between DO
and IO marking does not constitute a grammatical device that can be
manipulated to allow for different degrees of patient affectivity.","[150, 151]"
"       Where     this     condition   is not   met,   and   the   dual   subject   marker
competes with overt object markers for access to the final auxiliary slot,
Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr employ a set of portmanteau

"  3.5.2      Syntactic versus Lexical Incorporation
       In characterising the grammatical relations holding between a verb
and the bodypart terms that can be incorporated into it, Evans (to appear)
has shown how a distinction between syntactic and lexical incorporation is
beneficial in the analysis of bodypart incorporation in Mayali, a
Kunwinjkuan       language of south-west Arnhem            Land. Syntactic
incorporation is optional, fully productive and       constrained to certain
predictable grammatical relations between the incorporated nominal and
predicate. Lexically incorporated nominals, on the other hand, may bear a
wider variety of grammatical relations to the incorporating verb and are not
fully productive. Their meaning, which may be compositional or non-
compositional, cannot generally be paraphrased by omitting the
incorporated nominal, or by having it appear as an external nominal (loc.
cit.).
       This kind of analysis can usefully be applied to Ngan'gityemerri,
where syntactic incorporation also operates under fairly rigid constraints on
the nature of the grammatical relations that hold between a bodypart and a
predicate. Lexical incorporation, on the other hand, allows a wide variety of
grammatical relations to hold between a bodypart and a predicate, although
the nature of these relations is typically vague or variable, as lexically
incorporated bodyparts tend to lose the semantic characteristics associated
with their freeform occurrence, and function to narrow the scope of the verb
rather than retaining their identity as verbal arguments        . For certain
bodyparts we show how their effect on the scope of a verb shows signs of
developing into a quasi-classificatory system whereby they are incorporated
in a general sense to qualify verbs that are directed at particular iypes of
entities. Both these types of incorporation are treated in the following
sections.
        Only a single slot is available within the verbal structure for
incorporated bodyparts, both syntactic and lexical incorporations competing
for this position.   As a consequence of this, the syntactic incorporation of
verbal arguments is blocked where the verbroot is a lexicalised bodypart -
verb root compound.
      Syntactically incorporated bodyparts are always optional, they can be
omitted from the verb and instead be paraphrased by an external nominal.
Bodyparts can be syntactically incorporated into any semantically compatible
verb, whereas lexically incorporated bodyparts cannot be predicted, and
require specification within the lexicon.
        The main types of grammatical relations that are permissive of the
syntactic incorporation of bodypart terms are where their possessors are the
objects and locatives of transitive verbs, or the subjects of verbs formed with
the 'detransitivised' and 'Say' auxiliaries. Each of these are discussed below.
      In transitive verbs the incorporated      bodypart can denote the specific
whele object.      3-273        ngarim -fi -yedirr-tyat

as in most parts of the country, the Aboriginal perception of ‘language’?
names and relationships are not necessarily based on distinctive linguistic
attributes (Dixon 1980:43).   For the purposes of this grammar, I have used
the name Ngan'gityemerri to represent this linguistically defined language.
This should be clearly understood to be a linguistic abstraction of my own
2 I distinguish between linguistically defined language, and Aboriginally defined ‘language’,
by placing the latter in quotaton marks.
Note also that the practice of forming ‘language’ names through a compound with the word
for ‘language’, does not in any convincing way suggest that the primary reference of these
names is to language rather than people. This is a region where languages are spoken in
continous blocs of country. If you know someone's country, then you know their language, and
vice versa.    Within this environment, names that formally define languages, also define
their collective speakers and the country they belong to.

"1.5     Fieldwork Methodology and Grammar Writing
1.5.1   Getting started
        In 1981 I had just completed a Batchelor degree in linguistics, and
found myself inspired by one of Bob Dixon's courses in Aboriginal
linguistics to do some real fieldwork of my own. Wary of committing
myself to a post-graduate course, I canvassed around the ANU linguistics
department to find someone who I could accompany on their fieldtrip. This
I felt would satisfy my curiosity, giving me a taste of fieldwork, and at the
same time leave me in a position that I could back out of, if need be. Ian
Green took me up on my enthusiastic but completely deceitful promises to
cook, do the washing, and write up his paradigms and verb cards etc, and
took me to the Daly on the first of his Ph.D fieldtrips. Ian was learning
Marrithiyel from Bill Parry, so we ended up in Bill's camp on the west side
of the Daly river. Three elderly women in Bill's camp (including his wife)20Several of the features of New Ngan‘gikurunguurr that are mentioned here, including this
function of -gimin (H&K 1988:219), can be found in Hoddinott and Kofod's grammar of
Ngankikurungkurr. Their main informant is a ‘school generation’ New Ngan’gikurunggurr

widely around most of the NgW estates, combining jobs like hunting and
collecting ochres/firewood with some site-mapping, fulfilling Robert's
custodial role in certain estates, and the odd bit of fishing. Patrick Tyabada
frequently accompanied us on these trips, contributing his own stories and
general hilarity. While the bulk of my NgW data comes from a small
number of informants, I have regularly tested its acceptability within the
wider community of NgW speakers (see acknowledgements).
        Most of the Peppi community took an interest in my developing
language skills, making an effort to avoid speaking English to me, and
randomly testing my knowledge of words and expressions.               My more
spectacular errors (quite unrepeatable) featured regularly in community
gossip. This level of interest, though occasionally embarrassing, greatly
improved my conversational fluency in NgW.
        From the start Ngan'gityemerri people have always been keen to
have their language ‘written down’.           Although I have always been
encouraged by this expression of support, initially I felt uneasy about what
seemed to be two unstated inferences: that the language would somehow be
saved by this process, and secondly that my thesis would constitute some
sort of language resource that they could refer to like a dictionary. My
explanations of what my thesis would and would not be, produced varied
responses. Some people were plainly puzzled; if I was not producing a
resource for native speakers, or drills for language learners, just who would
use this book ? Others were quick to point out my obligations to make
available those products of my work that were of more immediate use, texts
and wordlists particularly.
       At Peppimenarti I was actively encouraged to work in the school, and
together with Terry Sam began a school-based language program. Although
we did develop and teach the orthography used here and commence
wordlists for each child, the main focus of this program has always been on
different ‘languages’.  Within a single ‘language’, people listening to a narrative will, in
whisper, query the acceptability of unusual auxiliary(+bodypart)+verbroot combinations,
and derisively hoot at erroneous or implausible ones. Within this context, my discussions
with informants about the acceptability of particular grammatical constructions, was not
considered particularly odd by them. Of course the responses I got were subject to all sorts of
variables, and where these were    uncontrollable, I have avoided relying on this material at
all, unless natural contexts could verify them. So while much of the description contained in
this thesis is based on the grammar of narrative text, and most of the examples cited are
taken from recorded texts, my understanding of such issues as bodypart incorporation and
auxiliary semantics in particular, owes a significant debt to the process of solid formal
elicitation.
fostering oral rather than written language skills. The school has been
building a collection of video resources, with the assistance of the National
Aboriginal Languages Program, that one day may be ‘patched in’ to local
television transmission.
1.5.3 Approach to Grammar Writing
        My approach to writing a grammar of Ngan'gityemerri falls fairly
squarely within the traditions of what Wilkins (1989:58) has referred to as
‘The ANU School of Australian Grammatical Description’. This tradition
places a high priority on the use of descriptive practices that best reflect the
linguistic system in question, and are sensitive to the cultural context of its
usage. Grammars written within this tradition are highly eclectic in their
use of linguistic theory, drawing on whatever grammatical tools best
achieve these descriptive aims, without being overly concerned about, as
Evans (1985:xii) puts it, ""whether they all come from the same toolkit"".
Writers within this tradition employ, and acknowledge their use of,
whatever theories best handle the particular aspect of the language they are
describing. At the same time they are wary of 'fad’ theoretical terminology,
believing that a grammatical description written in the most straightforward
language and containing a large number of natural language examples will
best allow the reader to judge the accuracy and internal consistency of the
description.
        I began this description of Ngan’gityemerri with the intention of
providing a full reference grammar of the language. I have been forced to
reduce the scope of this work by the realisation that languages having such
morphological density as this one does, cannot be adequately treated within
the thesis wordlength limitations imposed by the university. This thesis
cannot really be called a ‘grammar’, for it does not adequately cover some
aspects of the language, and others not at all. I have given fairly detailed
descriptions of the phonology and nominal and verbal morphology. As this
is a language in which the verb is “where the action is"", I have further
chosen to explore two of the most interesting aspects of the verb; the
incorporation of bodypart terms into the verbal complex, and the semantics
of the auxiliary verbs.","[48, 49, 50, 51]"
"2.1.3.1    Prominence of Active Articulators
        In the descriptions of many Australian languages ‘place of
articulation’ is typically viewed as a significant criterion in the analysis of
consonant phonemes. This term puts implicit and, for Ngan'gityemerri,
inappropriate focus on the passive articulator. In both Ngan'gikurunggurr
and     Ngan'giwumirri,      which   make   no     contrastive   distinction   between
alveolar and retroflex, or (inter)dental and palatal, there is nothing to be
gained by making an analysis in terms of passive articulators. In preference
we have four types of ‘active articulation’, one involving both lips -
‘bilabial’, and three involving types of tongue configuration          -'apical',
‘laminal' and ‘dorsal’.
        This type of system that focusses on tongue configuration, allows for a
wide range of mouth-roof space within which the tongue can make its
contact (or approximation). The contact point of apical phonemes thus
ranges from alveolar to postalveolar, and that of laminal phonemes ranges
from interdental to palatal. It is only at the allophonic level that we need
invoke the criterion of ‘place of articulation’. Elsewhere throughout this
work reference to phoneme types is made only in terms of active
articulators.
2.1.3.2 Realisation of Obstruent Phonemes
/p/ -       The bilabial stop [p"") is always voiceless, aspirated and long
            with no variation in closure type./b/ -       The bilabial stop [b] is always voiced and unaspirated, and is
            consistently shorter than the voiceless stop. However it exploits
            durational difference to a far lesser degree than is found for
            other articulator types (see 2.2.2). /b/ shows less fluctuation in
            closure type than do the other voiced stops, being always fully
            stopped.            is a bilabial fricative [9], lightly spread and with a small degree
            of lip tension. Observation of speakers' lip movement shows
            this sound to be truly bilabial, in that the teeth are not visible
            and the upper and lower lips are aligned and make even
            contact. However this sound has some of the turbulent quality
            (auditory correlate of energy higher in the spectrum) that is
            normally associated with labiodental articulation. The
            presence of this turbulence suggests that the lip spread and
            tension pulls the top lip sufficiently tightly against the upper
            teeth that they act as joint articulators in opposing the bottom
            lip. Even if the upper teeth do not actually come into contact
            with the lower lip, they at least approach it closely enough to
            generate wake turbulence. Among the younger speakers of
            Ngan'gityemerri, (who have been exposed to a considerable
            amount of Standard English through their schooling and, more
            recently, through television), this fricative is usually realised as
            a true labiodental [f].
            As has been noted for all other Australian languages that have
            both a stop contrast and fricatives, the contrast does not extend
            to the fricatives (Dixon 1980:215). /f/ is always voiceless
            initially, and varies between voiced and voiceless when
            intervocalic or post-liquid. /f/ only occurs post-nasally across a
            morpheme boundary in which environment it remains
            voiceless.            2-18   funggulu(NgW)       - sugarbag          [dangolu]

               This tendency towards voicing assimilation (assuming [9] to be
               the unmarked allophone), is much stronger in
               Ngan'giwumirri than it is in Ngan’gikurunggurr. A text count
               of word medial /f/ indicates about 80% are voiced in
               Ngan'giwumirri, compared with only about 15% in
               Ngan'gikurunggurr. Although this variation in the degree of
               glottal pulsing through the approximation duration of medial
               /£/ is biased differently in each dialect, it is still ‘free’ variation
               in the sense that it is non-contrastive within the phonological
               system of each dialect’.
               Finally, a very minor allophone, a voiceless bilabial fricative
               with labiodorsal secondary articulation [$”], has been recorded
               as a free variant of word initial [] in a single word only.               2-19    fa(K)-                beeswax       [$a] ~ [$a]
3We can further observe a type of ‘fixed’ variation, whereby certain cognate lexemes are
invariably realised    with      voiceless    /f/      in Ngan'gikurunggurr,     and    voiced   /f/   in
Ngan'giwumirri.

markers; that is, the minor phonetic differences between them are strictly and invariably
maintained as evidence of the separate identities of the two groups, usually at other levels
(eg. political). In discussion of these words, speakers will carefully point out that “we say it
this way, but that other mob say it this way"". So despite the non-contrastive nature of the
feature tvoice among fricatives within the phonological systems of each of these languages,
the same feature is employed cross-dialectically, within a subset of the lexicon at least, to
flag linguistic identification. How, within the scope of the general lexicon, certain lexemes
come to be employed in this manner remains a question for further study. Note though that
these kinds of examples nicely illustrate Labov's observation that there is really no such
thing as free variation, if social and stylistic variables are considered to constitute part of
the conditioning environment.
               We can partially account for the occurrence of this minor
               allophone by noting that this word is already marked as
               phonotactically odd, being one of only a handful of
               monosyllables, and one of only two beginning with /f/.
               The labiodorsal variant is unlikely to be the reduced form of an
               underlying disyllabic lexeme /fuwa/, because such a word
               would be equally phonotactically odd, as the labial semivowel
               is otherwise unattested between these vowels. And there are
               no other examples of [$”a] to suggest that all such underlying
               segments may have undergone reduction of this sort.               is a long voiceless aspirated apical stop [t""] with no variation in
               closure type.               is a short voiced apical stop. Both /t/ and /d/, but particularly
               /d/, exploit a fairly wide range of mouth-roof contact points,
               from alveolar [d] to post-alveolar   [d]. The degree of retroflexion
               found in apical stops is sensitive to the environment.       I
               perceive initial and intervocalic /d/ to be more retroflex than
               post-nasal /d/, and /d/ after back vowels to be more retroflex
               than /d/ after front vowels.
               Intervocalic /d/ can be very short, especiallyin unstressed
               syllables, and ir this environment is frequently
               reduced to an alveolar aproximant [1]. This realisation of /d/
               can be consistently distinguished from the post-alveolar
               continuant /r/ (also given below as [1] 4) by its shorter duration
               and lack of retroflexion.              is a voiced retroflex fricative. This sound is described by Capell
              as a ""retroflex rhotic with fricated release""(quoted in H&K
              1988:16), and by Hoddinott and Kofod as a ""retroflex fricative
              with rhotic release""(Hé&K 1988:16). Neither of these
              descriptions are particularly accurate in articulatory terms, if for
              no other reason than that neither fricatives nor rhotics have
              ‘release’. I do agree with both authors though, that auditorily
              there is a definite r-colouring to the realisation of this
              phoneme. This in itself presents a descriptive problem as the
4Note   that IPA (1989 update) provides no satisfactory mechanism   for differentiating
between alveolar and post-alveolar approximants.

developed diachronically from a cluster of flaps, ie /rr/ + /rr/.
Its restricted word position potential and low functional load

between two series of stops, the post-nasal environment is
‘neutralised’. For the laminals however, in the absence of a
contrastive voiced laminal phoneme, we would specify [ J] as a
post-nasally conditioned allophone of /ty/.

"  3.2.3.2               Dual Subject/Object Portmanteau Pronominals.
        In 3.2.3.1 above we have seen how object suffixes fill the final
auxiliary position immediately following the auxiliary root. In section
3.2.1.2.2 we saw that subject duality is encoded primarily by the suffix -gV,
also in this same position. That is, both morpheme types compete for access
to the same verbal slot.
        The dual subject marker -gV can only appear when this position is
otherwise empty of overt object morphology. This condition is met where
either a verb is intransitive and has no object argument, as in 3-84 a), or is
transitive but has a 3rd sg direct object, which is cross-referenced by - ©, as in
3-84 b).3-84       a)   werrmen'geny-gu

"       Additionally, and as noted by Green (1989:181) probably extending
from the general sense of motion from place to place, serialisation of the
'go' auxiliaries    can categorise verbs within several subtypes of the
imperfective aspect; repetitive, progressive and habitual, i.e. 'to keep doing
X, to do X again and again, to always do X'. For repetitive and progressive
aspect, as noted in the discussion above on literal motion, 'go*’ (in 3-248)
tends to differ from ‘go' in implying more motivated activity directed
towards a specific goal.      3-246 miyi-nyine        gzgu   mityity   fry-meyi   -tye -yedi

"Examples    3-275   a) - e) clearly demonstrate           both   the optionality   and
productivity of syntactic incorporation.          Example a) stands as a complete
verb meaning to ‘place something, to put it in position’. It additionally
incorporates general locative arguments              in examples b) - e), without
deriving a new lexeme or altering the meaning of the verb in any significant
way. In each of these examples the part-of-the-tree could optionally be
realised as an eternal nominal.
       Syntactically incorporated bodyparts cannot be construed as part of the
Subject of a transitive clause.     This can be best seen by looking at the
examples in 3-276 below, where in example b) the bodypart as part-of-S is
blocked from incorporation, and must appear as an external INSTRumental

                    (i.e. by pouting my lips)Likewise where a bodypart is fully coreferential with S, as opposed to
‘a-part-of-S', it can not be incorporated into the verb.            Thus in example b)

        As might be expected of a four vowel system, Ngan'gityemeri's
 vocalic phonemes allow a range of latitude in their phonetic realisation.
 However this range is certainly not as great as it could be, in that much of
 1Many of the Daly languages differ from, for instance the Kunwinjkuan languages, in having
 /a/ as a phonological back rather than front/central vowel. Tryon (1970) and Birk (1976) give
 /a/ as a back vowel for Merranunggu and MalakMalak, for example, although Green
 (1989:15) demonstrates that Marrithiyel /a/has a significant fronted allophone (see also the
 footnote on p31).
the ‘vowel space’, in the sense of Ladefoged(1975:67), remains unexploited.
For instance although unstressed vowels tend to be slightly centralised,
there are no truly central allophones, all normal phonetic realisation being
in the periphery of vowel space. The main opposition found is between sets
of tense and lax allophones, conditioned by word position.","[57, 58, 59]"

               liquid5.2.14 Variability in Noun Classification
       Although noun classes in Ngan'gityemerri are generally well defined,
the system is not so rigid that any nominal can belong to one and only one
class. Several examples have already been encountered in this chapter, and
in this section I briefly summarise the types of crossclassing that can be
found.
       Firstly, certain human lifestage/status/condition terms can be
assigned to both the ‘male’ and ‘female’ classes (see 5-35)!2.
        Secondly, in 5-66 we saw that some trees having no useful parts other
than their edible ones are assigned to the 'plantfood’ class. However where
such a ‘plantfood’ class prefixed noun is used in reference to the whole tree,
rather than its edible fruit, any modifiers of that noun will show concord
with the 'tree' class. Thus in 5-66 the head and modifying constituents of a
single NP are formally assigned to different classes. This represents a rather
different type of crossclassing.
       Thirdly,    nouns     that are    normally     members      of one     class   can   be
assigned to another class on the basis of colloquial or metaphoric extension.
In the discussion of miyi, we noted that 'tobacco' which was normally a
‘tree’ class member, could be designated as a ‘plant food' class member on
the basis of its colloquial reference as 'shit' (see 5-69).
       Fourthly, some variation is encountered in the class assignment of
objects that meet the defining criteria of more than a single class. Consider,
for instance, a wooden weapon, such as a tyulut spear. This is typically12These gender-variable nominals highlight the grey area between the word classes ‘noun’
and ‘adjective’. A principal difference between nouns and adjectives in Ngan'gityemerri is
that nouns typically belong to a single noun class, whereas adjectives concordially agree with
any noun they modify. Nominals like nugumang (in 5-35) generally have the characteristics
of nouns, but in their capacity to be gender-variable are more like adjectives.

"Having -nime marking number categories for both subject and object would
appear to be potentially very confusing, and begs the question - ‘what
happens when you get, for example, a Ist person plural inclusive subject
acting on a 3rd person trial object, or vice versa?'. Consider the following
example where -nime could denote either ‘plural subject’ or ‘trial object’.          3-94   ngandim-wurrki-fi         -me      -nime    gagu

" It is through this association with renewed activity, in contrast to the single
unchanged timespan associated with stative auxiliary selection, that
dynamic auxiliaries combined with these neutral CVSs can convey habitual
activity. This can best be demonstrated by pairing the same CVSs with both
stative and dynamic ‘intransitive’ auxiliaries.      4-103 a)   _ ngirim-fifi

        I will now turn my attention to the complex function of the
remaining minor simple auxiliaries, ‘Say’, ‘Arrive’, 'See' and 'Take'.
        As noted in 3.1.1 the complex function of the ‘say' auxiliary is quite
anomalous in having the auxiliary ordered after the verbroot, rather than
in the regular verb-initial position. This irregular ordering is exemplified
in 4-106 and 4-107. Further, the CVS no longer operates as a single
functional unit; incorporated bodyparts, for instance, do not shift to the pre-
auxiliary position along with the verb root, but remain in the post-auxiliary
position, as shown in 4-108 and 4-109.      4-106 ngambanam-palat         mumba        winy -meny -nin         Tyarambu

"       Note that the instrumental suffix is frequently omitted from NPs
whose instrumental role is predictable through a conventional association
with a particular verb.          6-12   yenggi      ngi            -pup-pe        palayin (-ninggi)

6.1.3   -ne/-ngini(K)     ‘PURPOSIVE
        The enclitic -ne/-ngini(K) marks the purposive complements of
actions or states. That is, purposive marked NP's are given as the stimuli or
‘what one has in mind' when one does or feels something. As response to
stimuli is dependent on the notion that the respondent is cognizant and
sentient, it is uncommon to find purposive complements given as adjuncts
to states or activities that have non-human subjects. Lower animates can be
said to ‘look about for food’ etc. but there are few such examples in any texts
I have recorded.

form a natural class with the two rhotics in all other occurrence positions.
        As is typical for Australian languages, initial stops and nasals are far
more likely to be peripheral than non-peripheral. Initial /t/ and /n/ each
account for less than 1% of the lexicon, and initial /ny/ is attested in two
words only - nyinyi ‘you sg.', and nyurrng ‘sniff,snort'. The voiced apical
stop /d/ has a far higher percentage of occurrence than we would predict for
a non-peripheral stop. This results from its initial occurrence on the
bodypart and 3sg subject prefixes, both of which have a high functional load.
Generally though, voiced stops are far less common word initially than
voiceless stops.","[96, 97]"
"Where Direct and Indirect Objects are plural (and recall that, cf. 3.2.3.1, their
formal marking       is neutralised        here), dual     subject number     marking   is
sacrificed to the cross-referencing of the object.           Thus, as in 3-89 below, in
verbs with dual subjects acting on non-singular objects, the subject can be
marked for plural number in the slot preceding the auxiliary root, but
number categories that are higher than plural on the markedness hierarchy,
cannot be overtly represented.3-89   warriny -ngirr-tyerr       -pu,     nyinyi tyagani derrigidi-yerim

       They (dl or pl)(airline hostesses) asked each of us (pl), ‘What would
       you like (to drink)?’In section 3.2.1.2.2 we saw that four auxiliaries marked subject duality, not by
-gV in the final auxiliary position, but suppletively by a change in the
quality of the vowel of the auxiliary root. For these few auxiliaries there is
no competition between dual subject marking and non-singular object
marking for access to the post-auxiliary root position. So verbs selecting
these auxiliaries can encode both their subject duality and the person and
number of their object.          3-90   ngarrene-nyi-mi-wap-pe            kinyi

"       The semantics of 'detransitivised' auxiliaries, and the consequences of
their selection in marking reflexivity and reciprocality, are taken up in more
detail in 4.5.2.      .
        Note though that reflexives and reciprocals can additionally be more
explicitly encoded with indirect object pronominal forms in the final
position of the auxiliary. In this function they differ from the other ‘goal-
like’ functions of the Indirect Objects in that they encode the
reflexive/reciprocal relationship for both higher and lower animates. That
is, the animacy restrictions that determine the eligibility of goal arguments
for cross-referencing within the verb (cf. 3.2.3.1), do not apply to reciprocals
and reflexives. Thus the lower animate subject of the reflexive verb formed
with the 'detransitivised' ‘Poke’ auxiliary in 3-98 takes Indirect Object
pronoun -ne.       3-98    e-fenggu       darany    -ne   -fi -dudu

"1.1     Language Names!
        The   names      Ngan'gikurunggurr       and    Ngan’giwumirri       are
etymologically compounds of ngan'gi ‘language/story/word' and
kurunggurr and wumirri. Kurunggurr is both the name of a particular
billabong in the muyil marshland west of Peppimenarti, and also the
general term, in both Ngan'gikurunggurr and Ngan'giwumirri, for deep,
dark water, as found midstream in a river. Ngan'gikurunggurr people do
not prefer either one of these referents, as opposed to the other, as the source
of the language name. The etymology of wumirri is not clear. In response
to my queries, some Ngan'giwumirri people have remarked upon the
similarity with wumirr ‘the resinous substance found among the roots of
the ironbark tree’. There is however no general agreement about the
relevance of this similar term to the language name, nor any supporting
morphological evidence (i.e. the final -i is otherwise unattested as any sort
of derivational suffix).
        Ngan'giwumirri and Ngan'gikurunggurr are, on linguistic criteria,
dialects of a single language. They share an identical phonemic inventory
(though realisation and stress rules differ); share identical verbal structure -
the number and semantics of their systems of auxiliary verb appear to map
onto each other perfectly; they share a cognacy rate of about 85%; and are
mutually intelligible. Speakers of these dialects refer to them as ‘languages’,
and acknowledge their subgrouping by comparing their degree of similarity
with other pairs of dialects - ""NgK and NgW go level, like Marrithiyel and
Marrisjebin go level"".       Speakers of both dialects agree that NgK is

y following the ng, denoting a palatal off-glide). Gamu is written in the orthography of
Harvey (pers. comm.), (who incidently believes the final vowel of Matngela to be i, e.g.
Matngeli). Murrinh-patha is written in the orthography used by the Port Keats school.

                 As established in 3.2 above, core case relations are obligatorily and
         explicitly cross-referenced within the verb. Consequently the specification of
         these relations through case inflections on NP’s filling these case functions
         is not required to clarify the identity of core case roles. Indeed verbal cross-
         referencing facilitates the widespread omission of contextually established
         NP's in core roles. No case suffix is available for those NP's that are cross-
         referenced within the verb as direct objects. NP's cross-referenced as ‘goals'
         can be functioning in peripheral purposive case roles, in which case they can
         take the purposive enclitic -ne/-ngini(K), or as reflexives, or the goals of
         predicates (like ‘tell’, 'give'), in which core roles they can bear no case        a   aL         inflection.
                 The subject of a verb is the only core syntactic role for which case
         inflection is available. These can be subjects of either high-transitive verbs
         or those low-transitive verbs that have a non-subject core argument (cf. 4.2).
         The agentive enclitic -ninggi is not universally applied to transitive subject
         NP's, but is reserved for those which are semantically or pragmatically
         ‘marked'. NP's can be semantically marked in the sense that their identity
         in the agentive role contravenes culturally determined expectations
         regarding actor identity in specific types of activity. In 6-1 below, for
         instance, markedness results from the low likelihood of an inanimate entity
         filling the role of a ‘controlling agent’.                 6-1   waya-ninggi       dam_    -ngi-syarr

        The prosodic analysis suggests that different stop types represent
different underlying syllable types, one containing a glottal stop, and the
other without. The phonetic glottal stop is a prosodic feature of the syllable,
and is thus always syllable final. Fortis syllables contain an underlying
syllable final glottal stop, to which the following stop assimilates and so also
becomes fortis. Lenis syllables contain no glottal stop, and the following
stop is thus lenis. The apparent fortis/lenis opposition results from the
emergence of fortis stops in an environment originally restricted to lenis
stops.
        This analysis has some neat advantages for Yolngu (Walker 1984). It
accounts for the distributional restriction of the contrast to the
intercontinuant position, accounts for restrictions on certain types of
consonant clusters, and also ties the distribution of the apparently separate
feature ‘glottal stop’ into the same analysis as the stop contrast. It also
requires only a single series of stops in the phonemic inventory, although as
Cook points out, this is no real economic gain as the contrast still has to be
marked on the syllables, and marking the syllables is really no more
economical than marking the consonants themselves.
        The geminate analysis, (based on McKay's description of Rembarrnga
(1975)), assumes that every voiceless intercontinuant stop is actually an
underlying homorganic voiced stop + stop cluster. From this cluster two
rules are required to produce a simple voiceless stop: 1) a degemination
rule, and 2) a subsequent devoicing rule. Like the prosodic analysis, the
geminate analysis requires only a single series of stops in the phonemic
inventory, the apparent contrast between stops on the surface resulting only
from the application of the degemination and devoicing rules.
         McKay's main evidence for this analysis is that both degemination
and devoicing are observable phenomena across morpheme boundaries.
McKay takes the devoicing and degemination of stop clusters that occurs
across morpheme boundaries and, analogously, extends them to morpheme
medial position.
         The geminate analysis also explains the restriction of the apparent
contrast to intervocalic and word medial position. By setting up clusters as
the basis for the distinction, the resulting contrast is represented as reflecting
phonotactic constraints that operate elsewhere in the language; ie. the stop
contrast, like consonant clusters, is not permitted word initially and word
finally; and the postnasal neutralisation of the contrast reflects the general
constraint on clusters of nasal + stop + stop .
             Merlan (1983:9) argues against McKay's extension of
intermorphemic degemination and devoicing phenomena to the analysis of
morpheme-medial position clusters on the grounds that it has unjustified
implications for medial consonant cluster distribution. Similar arguments
make a geminate analysis untenable for Ngan'gityemerri stops. The main
complications are firstly, that word-initial homorganic stop clusters would
be allowable, but no other clusters are permitted in this position. Secondly,
contrastive gemination of both voiced and voiceless stops, resulting from
the application of the apical assimilation rule, operates as an independent
phenomenon (see 2.2.2.2).
       Segmental analyses define a phonemic distinction on the basis of
articulatory differences. A distinction between two phonetically different
types of stop is directly reflected by phonemic symbols, making the
segmental analysis less abstract than either the prosodic or geminate
analyses.
       While segmental analyses vary widely, they tend to fall into one of
two categories: languages for which ‘voice onset time’ is a consistent
perceptual cue for the distinction of the contrast, and languages for which it
is not. In the Australian literature ‘fortis/lenis' has been widely used as a
cover term for these latter type of languages. Descriptions falling into this
category broadly seek to find some other phonetic property that will serve as
a basis for the contrast. In some of the literature this property is given as
‘fortis/lenis' or ‘force of articulation’, but without much     attention being
given to the actual phonetic data.
       Jaeger, in her paper based on data from Zapotec and Jawony (Jaeger
1983), examines the phonetic factors involved in producing the distinction
in these two languages, and seeks to find out whether ""these phonetic
properties are indeed a result of some unified and independently controlled
phonetic dimension for which ‘force of articulation’ is the correct
explanation"" (loc. cit.). She concluded that for both of these languages it is
‘duration’, or the timing of the gestures involved in speech production, that
is the independently controlled variable. As the only way in which any
extra ‘force’ is required to sustain a gesture for a longer period of time, is in
the circular sense that the overall energy expended by a muscle will be more
if it fires for a longer period of time, she concludes that ‘duration’ is a
phonetically more explanatory term than some vaguely defined notion of
‘force of articulation’.","[75, 76, 77]"

  2.5.3.1 Simple Verbs
         Simple verbs show an interesting split between syllable-timed stress
 marking and morpheme-timed stress marking. Verbs of up to four syllables
pattern with simple nominals in bearing primary stress on their initial
syllable, which will always be the bound subject pronoun‘, and secondary
stress on the third syllable if it is penultimate. Secondary stress cannot fall
on a final syllable.       2-111 a)         yé -menggeny                           You arrived.

                         SU Pres       DO 24The ‘Arrive’ and ‘Say’ auxiliaries (see auxiliary paradigms in the appendices A and B)
 have suppletive zero 3 sg bound pronouns in their present inflections. This is demonstrated for
 ‘Arrive’ below.
                                        I arrived
                                          You arrived

 In the case of these 3sg subject examples, the primary stress obviously falls on the initial
 syllable of the auxiliary root.
In 2-112 the secondary stress on the initial vowel of the second morpheme
happens to be coincident with the third syllable of the word, so our syllable-
timed stress rule is unproblematic here. However in 2-113 secondary stress
falls not on the third syllable, but on the fourth. What may be happening
here is that the psychological saliency of the morphology of the verb is
overriding the normal stress rule, a process we have earlier seen to operate
in stress placement on complex nominals. It seems in Ngan'gityemerri that
there is a preference for marking stress on morpheme-initial syllables,
where this does not disrupt the general principles of stress marking in a
major way. In 2-113 a) and b) above, the bound direct and indirect object
pronominal suffixes appear to be sufficiently ‘salient’ to motivate this
preference.","[121, 122, 123]"
