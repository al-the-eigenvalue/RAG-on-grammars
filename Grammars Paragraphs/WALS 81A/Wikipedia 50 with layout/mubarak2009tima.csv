The indicative form in Tima is unmarked morphologically.The common
word order for indicative sentences is SVO as in (119). Tima has another
word order according to the focusing/topicalization on certain
constituents of a sentence. The other word orders are: OV(S) as in (120),
VSO or SOV (Dimmendaal, 2009) 16.",[230]
"
2.4.1 Verb structure
Usually, the verb consists of a number of morphemes which express
different grammatical categories plus the verb root. The output verb form
is referred to as a verb stem. For instance, the English verb 'look' is
considered as a verb root where the verb 'look' plus the '-ed' past marker
form the verb stem 'looked'. The order of morphemes in the verb differs
from one language to another. Some of them appear either as prefixes/
suffixes or as infixes. If one looks at Swahili verb structure (an SVO
language), different slots are occupied by different morphological
categories,   for   example,    subject   agreement-Tense/Aspect-(object
agreement)-verb root-(derivational suffixes)-mood vowel. Tima verb
structure is much more complicated than the Swahili verb structure. The
Tima verb, in its most complex form, contains more than ten slots
expressing different grammatical categories, such as the following:
(negative marker) - aspect marker - proclitic subject marker – tense - verb
root - (derivational suffixes) - (object marker) - enclitic subject marker -
(negative marker) (see 4.2 on the verb as a word structure). These various
slots on the verb express different types of inherent grammatical
categories associated with the verb such as subject/object marker (i.e.
person markers), TAM, derivational affixes. These grammatical                                    35
categories of the verb will be discussed below with reference to their
occurrence mainly in African languages.","[56, 57]"
"
Therefore, in the passive construction, the subject is completely absent
(i.e. the subject deletion is obligatory), whereas the object of the active
voice is moved to the subject position and functions as a new subject in
the passive voice (DS = derived subject). Hence, the passive voice takes
the following word order:
DS + V
Thus, the passive in Tima is considered as a derivational process that
decreases the valency of the verb. In other words, the passive form, which
is intransitive, is derived from a transitive verb form. In this case, the
passive sentence consists of only one argument which is the derived
subject. The examples are:
(153) a. Active voice            kʊ-kwaak                    an-tɔm-aat̪aŋ                      kɨ-mɨnʌ            NC:sg-chicken               ASP.3sg-kill-COMP                  NC:sg-snake
            'the chicken killed the snake'         b. Passive voice            kɨ-mɨnʌ                     an-tɔm-t̪-ʊk-at̪aŋ            NC:sg-snake                 ASP.3sg-kill-?-PASS-COMP 26
            'the snake was killed'
26
     The function of the element '-t-' in the passive construction is not clear; it needs more investigation.",[258]
"
2.4.1.1 Pronominal markers
In African languages, the subject and object are normally expressed on
the verb by bound morphemes. The term 'pronominal markers' is used to
refer to subject/object distinctions. They are considered as an inherent
inflectional category of verb. By definition, the pronominal markers refer
to an entity of a noun phrase which is found elsewhere in the sentence
and they usually distinguish between subject/object from a syntactic point
of view.",[57]
"Hence, an additional morpheme '-N-' precedes the subject markers. In thiscase a phonological process takes place as a result of the fusion betweenthe morpheme '-N-' and the initial consonant of the subject marker 'dV' inthe case of 1st person singular. The resultant form is 'na/nʌ' (e.g. –N-dV-> -nV). The same process occurs with the 3rd person singular 'pɨnʌ'. Itfuses with the nasal morpheme '-N-'. Then the 3rd person becomes 'mɨnʌ'in the ergative case. With regard to the form of the 2nd person
singular/plural and the 1st person pl (incl/excl) the subject markers remain
the same, because they already start with nasal consonants (see Table
4.3). See example (26) for ergative marker.
(26) iɽɨŋkɨk-e        mook-nʌ     tɛk     beer-FOC        drink-1sg   Adv.before
     'I drank beer before'
4.3.2.2 The object markers
The object pronominal markers occur after the verb root and before the
enclitic subject markers in a transitive clause. The object markers have
the same forms as the enclitic subject markers (Set B); the only way of
distinguishing between them depends on their order in the clause.
Example (27) shows the different enclitic object markers on the verb.",[177]
"Slot 7, 8 and 9 contain the various derivational suffixes which are found
in Tima. These slots are ordered with respect to their position relative to
the verb root. These numbers show the relation of these suffixes to the
root (see also Section 4.5). This means their occurrence is restricted with
regard to the verbal root, i.e. in a complex formation of these derivational                                     146
suffixes, DER 1, for instance, can not follow the suffix in DER 2; it
should precede DER 2. This is shown in example (9a and b).

'take it by s.th)
Slot 10 contains the object pronominal markers (4.3) with a transitive
verb, as in (10). It is considered as an enclitic marker.
(10)

'(s)he hit me'
Slot 11 contains the subject pronominal markers (4.3). It also contains the
enclitic subject markers in the ergative case (see section 4.3.2.1.1).
(11)

'she was drinking'

4.3 The Tima pronominal system
Pronouns in Tima are part of various paradigms: independent pronouns,
subject pronouns referred to here as subject markers (SM), object
pronouns (OM) and possessive pronouns (see 3.2.5.1). In this chapter, the
independent pronouns will be presented. The main focus here will be on
the description of subject and object pronominal markers which are
cliticized onto the verb, i.e. they are treated as part of the verb structure.
The subject pronouns are considered as proclitics and enclitics on the
verb and the object pronouns are considered as enclitics.","[167, 168, 169]"
"
                                     134
3.2.6 NP's constituents order
As mentioned above, the Tima NP consists of different kind of modifiers
that occur with the noun. The modifiers differ in their order within a noun
phrase. See table (3.4) below.","[155, 156]"
"
It is found that there is sometimes a conflict among these different criteria
and one can not depend on one criterion irrespective of the others in order
to have a satisfactory definition of the word. Therefore, one must depend
in one’s definition of a word on all of the criteria together, in order to
have a comprehensive and clear picture of what the word meant. But the
most striking problem concerns the status of words as clitics.",[37]
"16
     The Tima word-orders need more investigation from a syntactic point of view.",[230]
"
Besides the phonological criteria, there are grammatical criteria that help
in defining and identifying the word. One criterion is based on the idea of
permutation of elements with one another. This situation occurs in a free
word order language like Latin where the elements of a sentence can be
permuted without any change in meaning. Moreover, it is possible to
insert another word between two already existing words. But it is not
possible to insert a word between formatives/morphemes without
changing the meaning (Matthews, 1991).",[37]
"
Pluractional marking usually involves the multiplicity of subjects, objects
or the repetitition of an action itself (Williamson and Blench 2000). For
                                    42
this aspect of plurality marking on verbs the term “pluractional” is coined
by Newman (1990) in his study of Chadic verbs (e.g. Kanakuru
language). Such phenomena are also widespread in Niger-Congo
languages. Aaron (1994) has studied verbal number in Obolo (Benue-
Congo language). He states that languages in general follow different
processes for expressing pluractionals on verbs. Examples of these
processes are: by way of affixes that are attached to the verb root, full or
partial reduplication of the verb root/stem, internal change of the verb
stem, or by using supletive verb forms to indicate plurality. The last
process, i.e. suppletive form is described by Bybee (1985) in her survey
of some languages of the world. She found that in Kung, a language of
southern Africa, there are two forms of verbs. One form is used when the
subject/object is singular and the other form is used when the
subject/object of a sentence is plural.","[63, 64]"

4.5.1.5.1 Benefactive
Beneficiary is another kind of applicative which increases the valency of
the verb. According to Payne (1991) the term means that an action is
done for the benefit of other person. Therefore, in most cases a clause
consists of two objects: a direct object and an indirect object. Thebenefactive meaning in Tima is expressed morphologically by the clitic '-ii' which is attached directly to verb roots in order to introduce a new NP.","[246, 247]"

                                         214
4.5.1.2 Pluractional formation in TimaFrom a typological point of view, pluractionality means plural action. It
may actually involve a combination of one of the following factors: (i)
one subject doing the action repeatedly to the same object, (ii) one subject
doing the action on several objects, (iii) several subject doing the action
on the same object (see section 2.4.1.5). Tima uses the idea of
pluractionality in order to distinguish the kind of action whether it is done
once or several times or whether it is done by singular/plural agents.
Tima has different strategies for expressing pluractionality; namely, as
follows:
(1) Pluractional formation by stem vowel change:Tima expresses the pluractional meaning through the change of the stem
vowel if it is compared between the non-pluractional and pluractional
verb stem. The examples are:
                                    215

This variation refers to theword order in a sentence. It is 'uŋ-' if the word order is SVO as in (41a) 8,while it is 'iŋ-' when the sentence has the structure of OSV as in (41b ), itis also noticed in the former example the appearance of the 1 personmarker '-nʌ' in the ergative case.

 The vowel of the subject proclitic marker 'uŋ-' in example ( ) above is harmonized with the verb rot
vowel which in this case include a back vowel. With other type of verb i.e. a root verb which includes a
non- back vowel, the subject proclitic marker is 'iŋ-', for example 'iŋ-kʌlʌʌk-dʌ yabuh', ' I ate meat'.","[190, 191]"
"
                                    313
The Tima pronominal system played a great role in the formation of the
verbal word. That is, the pronominal person markers (subject and/or
object) were obligatory on the verb, and without them the meaning of the
verb is incomplete (i.e. according to the syntactic function of the
participants).","[334, 335]"
"
4.1.3 Reduplicated verbs
Tima has another class of verbs involving reduplicated verb roots. This
class of verbs displays a category of full reduplicated verbs, where no
traces of partially reduplicated verbs are found in the data unless the
reduplication has a morphological function, indicating pluractionality (see
4.5.1.2). The reduplicated verbs here do not convey any grammatical
function. The examples of reduplicated verbs are shown below.
(1)
-munmun-                              'smile'-dumdum-                              'detain'-muɽ(u)muɽ-                           'asking God'-bʊlbʊl-                              'roll'
4.1.4 Compound verbs
In addition to the canonical shape of verb roots which is used in order to
classify verbs, Tima has a class of verbs which is classified according to
                                   140
their structural elements or components. That is, compound verbs are
formed by combining the verb as a head of the verb phrase (VP) plus a
noun which syntactically functions as object. The verbs in this class can
not stand by themselves, i.e. without such combinations with nominal
complements. The examples are:
(2)
a) ʊ-hɔɔ                ʌɽuuɽuk   ASP.3plhit          shoutings
  'they shouted (lit. they hit the shouting)' (the story of horse quarrel)
b) y-ʌhunen         t̪ɪh-ɪ         ø-ɪdɪdɪ  NC.pl-woman       pull out-Tr    NC.pl-yululate
  'the women produced the ululate (lit. the women pulled out the ululate)'
  (the story of horse quarrel)
4.1.5 Inflected verbs
Tima has a special class of verbs that are inflected for person. They have
an object semantically performing the role of recipient. By comparison,
the basic form of the verb (root) has its own meaning which differs when
it is associated with a pronoun. Consequently, the complex verb has a
new meaning. For examples:(3)Inflected verb                               The basic verb form
a) ayi-yaŋ 'visit (him/them)'                ay-ɪ       'go'
b) kʊnɛ-tʌŋ 'help (him/them)'                kʊnɛ        'prevent'
c) ahɪyʌŋ     'give him'                     ahɪ          'give'
                                          141
4.2 The verb as a word category
The term verb structure, sometimes referred to as 'verb group', indicates
that the verb consists of verb root plus different affixes (prefixes or
suffixes). The resulting form is referred to as 'verb stem'. The affixes
which appear on the verb are classified as either inflectional or
derivational morphemes. Their order with regard to the root differs from
one language to another. For instance, Swahili verb-structure consists of
up to ten different affixes (Lindfors, 2003). Tima verb structure is more
complicated than the Swahili verb-structure. The Tima verb form consists
of at least 12 elements. Table (4.1) illustrates the order of the different
affixes and clitical elements. Following the table is a description of the
different slots (along with examples). Parentheses in this table indicate
that the item is not obligatory.","[161, 162, 163]"
"
This nominalization occurs through a number of different derivational
processes. On the one hand, a language can derive a noun out of verb by
adding different affixes. For instance, Laggori, a Nilo-Saharan language,
derives a noun out of verbs by different suffixes to the verb (e.g. the verb'si', 'eat' is changed into the noun 'si-y-at', 'eating/food') (AlaminForthcoming). On the other hand, a language can use another device for
forming a noun. The noun is formed by means of reversing the order of
the verb and the object. This device is found in Gware, a Kwa language
of Nigeria (Creissels et al, 2008).",[284]
"
                                                  19
Therefore, languages usually use such types of morphological processes
in order to express different morphological functions, such as number,
case, polarity, etc. For instance, Asheron (a Niger-Kordofanian language)
uses the prefixes for number marking on nouns, in addition to other
prefixes which are attached to the adjectives in order to show agreement
between the noun and the adjective in a noun phrase (Alamin, 2003).","[40, 41]"
"
The above rule can be read as followingː the Tima noun phrase consistsof an obligatory noun head followed by a number of optional modifiers.
The modifiers occur in the following order: demonstrative, adj (age, size,
color, value), and number/quantifier. The optional modifiers are put in
parenthesis. The slash (/) between the numerals and quantifier indicates
                                        135
that these two constituents can not co-occur in a single phrase. Both of
these modifiers indicate more than one, i.e. they are in complementary
distribution. It is also noticed that there is free occurrence of adjective of
value and the quantifiers in terms of order, see example (c) in table (3.4)
and example (124) below. Both of the two examples are grammatically
correct.
(124) i-rtu                 i-hatam      i-mal      Nc.Pl-house          Pl-many      Pl-nice
      'many nice houses'
The examples in table (3.4) show that there is an agreement in number
between the head noun and other constituents in a noun phrase such as:
adjectives; numerals quantifiers. Note, however, that demonstratives
(unless they are used elliptically) and possessive pronouns do not agree in
number with the nouns they modify. See table (3.5) below.","[156, 157]"
"
Tima does not use the reduplication of nouns in order to show the
encoding of morphological distinctions. Other African languages
sometimes seem to use the reduplication of nouns as a productive process
of word formation or inflection, For example, Nyimang ( a Nilo-Saharan
language) uses this process to indicate a plurality of nouns or the
collective of whole (Stevenson, 1956) 5 . Tima does not have this
characteristic of reduplication, at least with respect to the noun.
Reduplication with verb roots is used in order to express repetition of an
action (compare Section 4.5.1.2). The reduplication with nouns occurs in
both singular and plural forms. In this case, two processes of word-
formation accompany the formation of reduplicated nouns: back
formation and haplology (see 2.2.1.3).",[316]
"
There is frequently a problem in analyzing these pronominal markers in
African languages. They are analyzed as independent words, because
                                     36
they have forms which differ from those of independent pronouns in a
language. Now the pronominal markers have been identified correctly,
they frequently have turned out (in the majority of African languages) to
be bound subject and object markers.","[57, 58]"
"
                                                    41
participants that the verb takes (e.g. causative, benefactive, dative,
instrumental) and decreasing valency, i.e. decreasing the number of
arguments/participants in the clause (e.g. passive, antipassive, reciprocal,
reflexive, and directional: oriented goal / towards or from speaker).
According to Whaley (1997) the verb's valence is not fixed. Therefore, it
can be manipulated in a number of ways, for example by way of
morphology, word order or by other devices.","[62, 63]"
"
Tima expresses the passive morphologically by the suffix '-ɨk/-ɘk' on theverbs. The passive suffix is affected by the root vowel harmony (see
                                    236
Bashir forthcoming). The active word order of the sentence in Tima is:
SVO.","[257, 258]"
"
In particular, Tima is considered as a poorly known language due to the
few linguistic researches that have been carried out in order to describe
and document it. In fact, there were no specific linguistic studies devoted
to the investigation of Tima. Therefore, the earliest studies on Tima are
fairly limited. It was first mentioned by Meinhof (1916-17), whose
attempt was to study Katla, but for comparative reasons he also collected                                    8
little material on Tima. MacDiarmid and MacDiarmid (1931) recorded a
short word-list and some sentences from both Katla and Tima.","[29, 30]"
"
4.5.1 Operations of increasing valency
4.5.1.1 Transitive suffixes
According to Payne (1997), a language can classify verbs according to
their transitivity, i.e. either transitive verbs which take an object as an
obligatory constituent, intransitive verbs which do not take an object,
ditransitive verbs which take two objects (direct and indirect object) or
ambitransitive verbs which can be constructed with or without the object.",[233]

  c-ɪt̪ɪ               a-rdi  NC.sg-cloth          STAT.sg-red
  'the cloth is red'
On the other hand, the verbs in Tima usually marked by the stative aspectmarker 'a-/ɪ-' express the perfectivity of an action/event. In this case, thestative marker precedes the verb root plus the pronominal marker
(subject). An example is:
(114)
an-diy-ʌŋASP(stative).3sg-come-Ven
'he/they came'
4.4.3 Mood
This section will shed light on the different types of moods (see 2.4.1.2
on mood types) found in Tima. The imperative form will be described in
4.4.3.1. The subjunctive form will be shown in 4.4.3.2. The indicative
will be presented in 4.4.3.3 with regard to the word order in Tima
sentences. Section 4.4.3.4 will briefly show how the interrogative is
formed in Tima. Negation will be discussed separately in section (4.6).","[225, 226]"
"
Type 1: Compounds with 'arɔŋ'Compounds can also be formed by a bound word 'arɔŋ', which means'one who likes'. The word 'arɔŋ' must attach to a noun in order to give afull meaning. Thus, the result is agentive noun, as can be seen in (65) (see
5.1.2). It always carries a negative connotation.",[328]
"
In his book on aspect, Comrie (1976) mentioned that the distinction
between telic and atelic verbs does not involve the verb only but it also
refers to the verb together with its arguments (subject and object). This
situation also holds true for Tima, where the telicity of verbs depends
heavily on the number of arguments as well as semantic and pragmatic
properties associated with the object of a sentence. The verb in Tima can
be described as a telic verb if the object is singular, whereas the same
verb can be described as atelic and has a different form if the object is
plural; i.e. it refers to more than one entity. This usually invovles the
concept of pluractionality in Tima.

                                       183
Tima has a number of different verb classes that refer to telic and atelic
verbs. The following paragraphs will present and describe these classes of
verbs.","[204, 205]"

2.4.2 Head-marking language
Having completed discussing the most important inflectional categories
(pronominal markers, TAM, negation) and derivational categories on
verbs (DAs and pluractional), we are now in a position to classify a
                                      43
language like Tima on the base of this information. A language which has
such a rich inflection and derivation system is classified as a head-
marking language versus a dependent-marking language like Ghulfan, a
Nubian language spoken north of Tima. In a head-marking language the
verb as the head of the clause/sentence carries all the information with
regard to person markers, TAM, and derivational operations expressing
the different semantic roles involved in the structure of the verb. On the
other hand, dependent-marking languages usually makes distinction
between subject and object (i.e. the syntactic function of a noun) by way
of morphological case markers on nouns (e.g. nominative-accusative
case, as in Latin (Corbett, 1998) or the Nubian language Ghulfan for that
matter.","[64, 65]"

                                                      237
It is found in the data that Tima has another device to demote the role of
the actor; namely, the use of an impersonal 3rd person singular/plural.
This is due to the fact that the 3sg/pl does not refer to any specific group
or individual. This strategy is considered as the most common device for
the passive formation according to the speakers.          The word order
concerning this type of passive is SVO.","[258, 259]"
"
The study uses different techniques in collecting primary data: firstly, a
collection of word-lists. This word-list is recorded and transferred into
Audiofiles 3 . This helps considerable when trying to listen to the proper
pronunciation of words and sorting out the different noun-class prefixes
found in Tima. The second technique for collecting the data is elicitation.
It mainly helps in describing the various morphological features and the
grammar of a language. The elicitation is done with native speakers by
using both English and Arabic in order to avoid misunderstanding of
sentences. Thirdly, a number of texts were collected and subsequently
written by using the Transcriber program. The stories include stories,
songs and procedural texts. These texts help a lot in identifying the
different types of word classes and sentence structure. In addition, they
support the description and analysis of the most problematic phenomena
found in Tima, such as tense and aspect.",[31]
"
Chapter two has covered all the necessary information that is required in
discussing the word structure of a language like Tima. It described first
how the word is defined from a linguistic point of view (2.1.1); in
addition, the most important operations (2.2.1) that build up the words in
languages have been discussed with examples from other languages and
with reference to the Tima language as well. Sections (2.3) and (2.4)
handled the two major categories found in this language: the noun and the
verb. The major inherent grammatical categories associated with each
class have been described and discussed elaborately. The final output of
the verbal categories reveals that one can classify the language according
to the way syntactic and semantic relations are expressed; this
information may be expressed mainly on the verb, in which we are
dealing with a head-marking language at the clausal level, or,
alternatively, on noun phrases expressing different semantic roles, in
which we are dealing with a dependent-marking language (2.4.2).",[333]

4.3.2.1.1 The subject ergative enclitics markers
Tima has a set of subject pronominal markers in the ergative case (Set C).
They occur in transitive clauses when the object of the clause is in focus.","[176, 177]"
"
Tima subject and object pronominal markers are obligatory in a clause
even if a noun phrase or a free personal pronoun occurrs in a clause (see
Section 2.4.1.1 for the different stages of pronominal marking).",[171]

                                     39
2.4.1.3 Negation
Sometimes, negation is considered as a mood type in contrast with
imperative and interrogative sentence type. But here the negation is taken
as a verbal inflection which modifies the verb and the verb phrase. This
leads us to distinguish between two types and strategies of sentence
negation as found in African languages. The first type is an internal
negation of the verb word which is common in African languages. This
usually involves affixes either before or after the verb word. An example
of this strategy is found in Aghem, a Benue-Congo (Niger-Congo)
language (Anderson, 1979), and in Labala, a Bantu (Niger-Congo)
language (David Morgan, p.c.). The second type is an external negation
of the verb word. That is, negative particles occur in clause-final position
and it negates the whole clause or sentence. In the case of transitive
verbs, the negative particle occurs after the object. This type is found in
Chadic languages in Nigeria and Cameroon (Creissels, 2008).","[60, 61]"
"
2.4 The verb
This section presents and discusses the structure of the verb with regard
to the most common inherent grammatical/morphological categories
which are associated with it. In most languages, especially African
languages, the most complicated word structure is found with regard to                                      34
the verb. All the information about arguments indexation (pronominal
markers), TAM distinctions, negation and verb extensions are encoded on
the verb by means of affixes or by other word formation processes (see
2.2.1). This complexity is found in languages which have a very rich
inflection system, such as found in the Niger-Congo languages (e.g.
Swahili).","[55, 56]"
"
4.3.1 Free personal pronouns
Free pronouns represent a closed word class. According to language
typology, the pronouns usually substitute the noun or noun phrase in a
subject or object position. Dimmendaal (2004) has sorted out the
independent Tima personal pronouns as shown in table (4.2):
1sg        kɨdʌ
2sg        ŋaaŋ
3sg        pɨnʌ
1pl incl   ɪnɛɛy
1pl excl   iniin
2pl        ɪnaan
3pl        ihinʌ
Table (4.2): Tima Free personal pronounsTable (4.2) shows that Tima does not have a gender distinction in the 3rd
person singular and plural. Tima on the other hand distinguishes between                                     148
1p (incl) and 1pl (excl). The free personal pronouns can be used in
isolation i.e. in a minimal NP. One example is:
(12) kɨdʌ         ka-bandị      1sg       NC.sg-teacher
      ' I am a teacher'
In Tima the presence of these independent pronouns is optional, i.e. the
sentence can stand without them and their occurrence gives more
information on the subject/agent of the clause (as Creissels, 2000 has
characterized this phenomenon). At the same time, the presence of
dependent subject pronouns (pronominal subject markers) is obligatory
on the sentence (see 2.4.1.1). The sentences in (13) are examples:
(13)
1sg         (kɨdʌ) cɛŋ-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-dʌ kʊkwan      'I shut the door'2sg         (ŋaaŋ) cɛŋ-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-ŋaŋ kʊkwan      'you shut the door'3sg         (pɨnʌ) ca-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-ø kʊkwan         'he/she shut the door'1plincl     (ɪnɛɛy)ce-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-nɛɛy kʊkwan     'we shut the door'1plexcl (iniin) cɛ-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-niin kʊkwan         'we shut the door'2pl         (ɪnaan) ca-na-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-nan kʊkwan 'you shut the door'3pl         (ihinʌ) ca-kɪdɪm-ataŋ-ø kʊkwan        'they shut the door'It is found in the data that the independent personal pronouns are
inflected by different focus markers which appear in combination with
them (Dimmendaal, 2009), the examples of personal pronouns with
enclitic focus markers are as follows:                                       149

The same focus markers are used with proper names and names of places.

          'for Babu I bought it'
4.3.2 Pronominal markers on verbs
Creissels et al (2008: 92) mentioned that a ""pronominal marker is applied
to any bound morpheme referring to an entity that is represented
elsewhere in the same clause by a noun phrase"". Thus, the pronominal
markers function in subject and object positions and they are considered
as bound morphemes. Sometimes, they are referred to as 'pronominal
reference marking on verbs' (Spencer, 1998).","[169, 170, 171]"
"
Haplology is another type of word formation process. It is defined as ""a
special type of dissimilatory loss of a whole syllable before or after a
phonetically similar or identical syllable"" (Hock, 1991: 109). For                                     23
instance, the Latin word 'nutrix', 'nurse' undergoes haplology where theregular feminine agent noun should be 'nutri-trix'. This form should notbe like this because of the identical syllable in word final position.
Therefore, the word is formed only with one of the two identical syllables
in order to avoid the repetition of similar syllables (Anderson, …).","[44, 45]"

drunk' (Anderson, 1985b). It is noticed that the vowel is 'i' in the present,in the past the vowel is changed into 'a' while in the participle the vowelis changed into 'u'. Semitic languages are other examples which have anextensive system of vowel alternations. Consonant alternation is quite
common in many African languages and it plays a grammatical function.
For example, in Laggori (a Nilo-Saharan language) there is an alternation
with the root-initial consonant which distinguishes between 1sg and 2 pl
in the imperative forms (e.g. the consonant 'k' is changed into 'g')
(Alamin, 2008). Many languages mark grammatical categories of a word
with suprasegmental features such as stress and tone. In Spanish verbs,
the stress plays a role in distinction of tense. On the other hand, many
West African languages use the tone in order to mark the tense/aspect
distinctions (Payne, 1997).","[41, 42]"
"
4.5.2.1.1 Reflexive
Reflexive is a derivational process which usually reduces the verb
valency i.e. the number of arguments in a sentence. Reflexive refers to a
construction of a verb where the subject/agent and the object/patient are
the same entity (Foley and Van Valin, 1985).",[252]
"
Similarly, the words in Tima are built up by a large number of affixes.
For example, Tima has a number of noun-class prefixes which attach to
the root in order to distinguish between singular and plural nouns (e.g. the'kV-' classes for singular and the prefix 'i-' and its allomorphs for pluralnouns) (see Chapter 3, Section 3.1). Moreover, Tima makes heavy use of
suffixes which show different functions, especially with regard to the
verb extensions (verbal derivations), such as suffixes that are used toderive a causative verb from other verb (e.g. –ik) (see 4.5.1.3), thetransitive suffix '-i' (see 4.5.1.1), the instrumental suffix '-aa' (see4.5.1.4), ventive suffix '-Vŋ' (see 4.5.2.4), etc.",[41]

verb root. The object markers sometimes precede the subject pronominal
markers as in (28a). In other cases, the subject precedes the object marker
as in (28b).

It has been mentioned above that the pronominal subject markers in set

This chapter covers most of the basic concepts which are related to the
study of word structure in a language. It is divided into a number of
sections: Section (2.1) defines the study of word structure; Section (2.2)
presents the structure of words and how these words are formed by using
different morphological processes. The major word classes are nouns and
verbs, which are discussed with reference to their inherent grammatical
categories in Sections (2.3) and (2.4), respectively.","[34, 35]"
