11.1.2 Verb types (valency)Verbs have the usual valency possibilities: intransitive, transitive, ditransitive.
However, the distinction between transitive and intransitive is muddied in
Jamsay by the large number of idiomatic object-verb combinations (including
those with cognate nominals), and to some extent subject-verb combinations;
see below, §11.1.5-6.
     Intransitives that have a subject but no direct object include stance verbs
like di N
        $ e@- ‘sit down’ and atelic motion verbs like ya$na@- ‘glide’.
     Telic motion verbs like ya&˘- ‘go’ and yE$rE@- ‘come’ are basically
intransitive (with optional locational adverbial). They may appear to be
transitive, like the first ‘go’ verb in (618), which has ‘place’ as destination.(618)     [di ˘$ <  E$nE@ ya$˘-go@-Ø                ji $˘< cE^w] ya&˘ $-Ø

          ‘Places that she previously did not go to, (now) she goes.’ 2004.3.19     However, telic motion verbs, in their primary senses, often fail the crucial
test of transitivity in Jamsay: they do not take object pronominals. Informants
                                          11.1 Regular verbs and VP structure   389generally rejected such proposed combinations as #ko@ ya&˘-ya$-m ‘I went to it’,
and similar constructions for ‘come’, and ‘go out’. Therefore cases like ‘place’
in (618), above, are best understood as covert adverbial PPs with the
postposition omitted. Such omission is most common with place names like
ba$ma$ko@ ‘Bamako’, which in most contexts are understood as adverbial in
nature without an overt postposition.
     In the sense ‘go/come to (sb)’ with human destination, a PP with
postposition le$ or its pronominal counterparts is used: mi&-n yE$rE$-Ø ‘He/She
came to me.’
     There are, however, some transitive uses of telic motion verbs in non-
primary senses. ya&˘- ‘go’, for example, may take an object denoting the entire
trajectory rather than the destination. In (619), the pronoun ko@ is the object.(619)   [ki $lo$mE@˘tE@rE$     tE@˘mE@dE$    ta&˘n]

        [foot Inst]        NonhO go.Impf-2PlS
        ‘Three hundred kilometers, you’ll go that (distance) on foot.’ 2004.4.5     With nu@˘- ‘enter’, informants again disliked pronominal objects in
elicitation sessions, but the textual example (620) shows that they are possible.(620)   [ko$ a$na@] ko@       ba@lla@    me$y< ko@        nu@˘-be$
        [Dem village] NonhO go.around and       NonhO enter.Impf-2PlS
        ‘that town [topic], you-Pl will go around it and enter it (by the back
        way).’ 2004.5.2     Transitives include the usual verbs involving impact or creation (‘cut’,
‘knock down’, ‘hit’, and the like). ‘Have’ is expressed by transitive quasi-verbs
including sa$- (§11.5.1). There are some ‘put’ verbs with a direct object plus an
optional locational, e.g. na@˘na@- ‘put (sth) up on (sth)’. Basic perception verbs
are transitive: E@˘- ‘see’, a@ƒa@- ‘hear’.
     Defective quasi-verb ku$n- ‘be in, be part of’ functions syntactically as
though the sense were ‘be put in’ (cf. the high-frequency transitive ku@no@- ‘put’
or ‘put in’). It requires a locational complement, as in [X bE@rE$] yç@ku$n- ‘be in
X, be part of X’. An example is (621).(621)   [[wo@ je$ju$-gu$ju@] le$]    cE@lla^l   yç@ku$n-Ø
        [[3SgP body]         in]     health     existbe.in.L-3SgS
        ‘Health is in his body.’ (=He is able-bodied) 2004.4.22
390     VP and predicate structure
    Many verbs may be used either transitively or intransitively without overt
derivational morphology; see the discussion of ambi-valent verbs in §9.5. One
typical pattern is where the intransitive functions as a (medio-)passive of the
transitive. There is no productive morphological passive, so the ambi-valent use
of basically transitive verbs fills a void.
    Ditransitives include o@˘- ‘give’ and te@˘re@- ‘show’. They have a direct object
for the theme and a dative indirect object for the recipient. (There is no
“promotion” of the dative to direct-object status.)
11.1.3 Valency of causativesCausatives are formed from underlying transitives, as long as the semantics
make sense in at least some situation. Such causatives of transitives have two
direct objects (622).(622)     a. [ç$rç$-ni N

11.1.4 Verb PhraseIt is reasonable to speak of “VP” in a broad sense as a clause minus pre-clausal
topics, minus the subject NP, and minus AN inflection. This notion of
subjectless VP is operative in some types of chaining, e.g. with linking particle
me$y<, and in infinitival complements as with (same-subject) ‘want’.
     The linear order of preverbal constituents was discussed in §2.6. As noted
there, pronominals (dative, object, and in relative clauses also subject) normally
follow nonpronominal constituents unless focalized or topicalized. The normal
relative order of (untopicalized, unfocalized) nonpronominal preverbal con-
stituents is (623). This order is not rigid.(623)     a. temporal locatives (e.g. ‘yesterday’)
          b. subject
          c. dative, object, other adverbials (direct object often last)
                                           11.1 Regular verbs and VP structure        391     The relative order of (nontopicalized, nonfocalized) preverbal pronominals
is (624).(624)   a. dative
        b. object
        c. subject (L-toned subject pronominals in relative clauses)    In verb- and VP-chains, preverbal subject markers in particular occur
immediately before the final verb (e.g. the participle in a complex relative
construction), while dative and object pronominals may precede earlier chained
verbs (in bare-stem form). For examples of these ordering patterns see §2.6.
    The notion of VP is sometimes difficult to apply in chains, where two verbs
arguably (but detabably) merge into a single “compound verb” and jointly take
a single set of arguments and adverbials, or a partially overlapping set of the
same. See §15.1.5 for examples. As a result, I often refrain from using brackets
to demarcate VPs in chains.","[410, 411, 412, 413]"

‘this/that’ do not co-occur, so I cannot order (e1) and (e2) relative to each other.
In practice, ka^˘< ‘each’ nearly always occurs in simple NPs of the shape [noun
+ ka^˘<] with no other modifiers. The combination [noun + adjective + ka^˘<] is
elicitable in the relevant sense (with tone-dropping on the adjective as well as
on the noun), but uncommon, unless a further cE^w ‘all’ is added to insure the
quantificational reading of ka^˘<. Perhaps the tendency to avoid NP-final
quantifier ka^˘< after an already complex NP reflects a homonym clash with ka^˘<
‘also, too’ (variant ka@r<a$), which does occur freely after NPs of any shape. To
be sure, ka^˘< ‘each’ and ka^˘< ‘also, too’ have different tonal effects; ka^˘< ‘each’
induces tone-dropping on the preceding word, while ka^˘˘< ‘also, too’ has no
tonal effect.
     There is some variation in ordering within (311.f) area. (f2) and (f3) may
occur in either order. (f1) and (f2) may likewise occur in either order. However,
(f3) must follow (f1) if both are present.
     The two demonstratives, discourse-definite in (311.b) and deictic in (311.e),
do not often co-occur, but their combination is grammatical.
     Examples are in (312), with the noun heading the NP bolded. The positions
in (311) that are filled in each example are listed in parentheses on the right. I
use _ in these formulae to indicate unfilled slots, with (e) and (f) counted as one
slot each. (312.a) has two adjectives in position (d).(312)   a. ma@    u$ro$     da$ƒa$ pi@ru@             be@      (a _ c d(2) _ f1 _)

6.1.2     Headless NPs (absolute function of demonstratives, etc.)Headless NPs, those where the head noun is omitted and not replaced by a
personal pronoun, are (apparently) headed by another element in the NP. (For a
similar omission of head NPs in relatives, see §14.1.6). The examples of
headless NPs involve deictic demonstrative nu@No$, cardinal numerals, and
adjectives. One could argue that such phrases involve a zeroed noun as head.
     In this absolute function, demonstrative nu@No$ is the most common of the
bunch, since there is no other way to express (deictic) ‘this/that’. Cardinal
numerals and adjectives are only occasionally absolute; much more often there
is a noun, even a semantically “light” one like ‘thing’ or ‘person’.
     Examples, mostly elicited, of various elements in absolute function are in
(313.a-d). (313.e) has a possessor, a modifying adjective, and a numeral.(313)     a. nu@No$      mi&-n        e$l-la@-Ø

           ‘Give me my two red ones!’ (uncommon)    Demonstrative ko$ arguably occurs as a one-word NP in a few examples (i.e.
with zero nominal head). However, the available examples have an alternative
parsing with L-toned preverbal subject pronominal ko$, which is syntactically
possible for subjects of relative clauses and some other subordinated clause
types. In (314), for example, I take ko$ to be an L-toned preverbal subject, which
can occur in conditional antecedent clauses (§16.1.2).(314)   ko$                go@˘-ya$-Ø         ta@Na$˘    de$y

e.g. English mine, French le mien, etc., has a semantically light possessed noun
ce@ ‘possession’ as head. This form, presumably related to cE&˘ ‘thing’, also
occurs in possessive constructions of the type ‘X is Y’s possession’, i.e., ‘X
belongs to Y’ (§11.5.3). ce@ is an inalienably possessed noun, requiring L-toned
possessor pronominals or a possessor NP without Possessive ma$ (§6.2.1). In
(315.b), ‘theirs’ denotes the girls’ excision ritual, which is parallel to the boys’
circumcision, which was described in the preceding discourse (both are referred
to as “causing to drink porridge”).(315)   a. [mi $   ce@]            n)çw

             2004.3.18     This construction is confined to cases where the referent object is
nonhuman. Efforts to elicit a human counterpart, whether alienable (‘boss’) or
inalienable (‘father’), were unsuccessful. For example, ‘his boss/father is good,
mine is bad’ was always translated with the referent noun repeated e.g. (‘his
boss is good, my boss is bad’).
     Universal quantifiers are not used absolutely as NPs. However, both fu@˘ and
cE^w can occur with a preceding Nonhuman pronoun ko@ (with tone dropped to
ko$) in the relevant sense; (316.a) illustrates this for fu@˘. The emphatic adverbial
so@y ‘all, everything, totally’ can be used absolutely, as a kind of NP substitute

6.1.3     Detachability (in relatives)There is a distinction between those postnominal elements that remain with the

            universal and distributive quantifiers    As explained in Chapter 14, the head NP does not move out of the clause,
instead, its status as relative head is signalled by tone-dropping. The relative
clause ends in a participialized verb with noun-like suffixes agreeing in number
and humanness with the head NP, so the entire clause is morphologically
nominal. (A second copy of the head noun may appear after the relative-clause
proper, following Possessive ma$, but this is not relevant to the present point).

    In cases like (320) it might seem that Pl be@ stays within the head NP.
However, be$ here is really the L-toned 3Pl subject pronominal (used in relative

                                                $ e$ ‘person’ (which functions as
direct object within the clause). However, there are rare examples where Pl be@
does seem to remain within the head NP, in which case it (like the head noun)

dropping applies after Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141) (§3.7.4.1), which
lengthens the stem-final short vowel in the participles of (321.b-c). (321.d) is

6.1.4     Internal bracketing and tone-droppingIn addition to the order of words within NP’s, we must also pay attention to tone
patterns. The NP-internal combinations in (322) require the item on the left to
drop tones to all-L. Here, the item on the left is tonally dependent on the item

with the core NP, excluding possessors.","[246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253]"

2.6    Main clauses and constituent orderAs already mentioned in §2.2, Jamsay clauses are verb-final, except that
subordinating elements may follow the verb. Temporal adverbials like ya@˘
‘yesterday’ normally occur at the beginning of the clause. However, probably
reflecting real-time production glitches, in casual speech an adverbial or other
constituent is occasionally “extraposed” and articulated postverbally, with a
prosodic break, as an afterthought or clarification (12). Such constructions are
avoided in elicited sentences.
                                        2.6 Main clauses and constituent order   17(12)    a. du$nda$Na@ yE$rE@ be@  tE$mE$-Ø      [e$ju@  bE@rE$]

           ‘He forced him to eat the excrement.’ 2004.4.4    In main clauses, there is a pronominal-subject suffix on the verb (whether
or not the subject is also expressed by a nonpronominal preverbal NP). In such
clauses, pronominal subjects are outside of the scope of the linear ordering of
preverbal constituents. This leaves us with objects, datives, nonpronominal
subjects (expressed by noun-headed NPs), and adverbials. The regular ordering
pattern is (13).(13)    main clause (unfocalized)        1.   adverbials (especially temporal) and focalized constituents
        2.   nonpronominal (i.e. full-NP) subject
        3.   nonpronominal dative, object, and adverbials (especially locatives)
        4.   pronominal dative and object (loosely proclitic to verb)
        5.   verb with pronominal subject suffix    This can be roughly summarized as Adv-SNP-X-V, where “X” is everything
else and where (unfocalized, nontopical) pronominals occur at the end of X (as
proclitics to the verb). (14.a) begins with a temporal adverbial, then has a
second person singular object pronoun (“2SgO”), then a verb with AN suffix
(Resultative) and a 1Sg subject (“1SgS”) suffix. (14.b) illustrates subject-object
ordering with nonpronominal NPs.(14)    a. ya@˘       u@       E@˘-sa$-m

           ‘The hyena ate the hare.’    A dative usually precedes a direct object when both are nonpronominal
(15.a), though sequencing is not completely rigid. This ordering is obligatory
when both are pronominal (15.b). However, a Nonhuman object pronominal is
18     Sketch
optionally omitted when understood, a tendency that is probably intensified in
the presence of a dative pronominal (15.c).(15)      a. [[mi $     de^˘]     le$]    bu@˘du$    o@˘-sa$-m

             3Sg-Dat give-Reslt-1SgS
             ‘I gave (it) to him/her.’     The above is somewhat idealized, since it does not consider focalization or
topicalization. In focalization (§13.1), some constituent preceding the verb
functions as focus, whether or not it is overtly marked as such by Focus clitic
y$. If the focus is a pronominal subject, it appears as an independent pronoun,
with or without y$, and there is no subject pronominal on the verb. This
focalized pronoun appears at or near the beginning of the clause (16).","[38, 39, 40]"

          ‘It’s we [focus] who go to bed here.’    There is also a great deal of topicalization in Jamsay discourse (§19.1).
NPs and independent pronouns are regularly placed to the left of a sentence,
usually with at least some prosodic break. The sentence proper usually has
pronouns coindexed to these presentential topical NPs (17). This is especially
diagnostic of topicalization in the case of objects, since a pronominal object is
not used in addition to a clause-mate nonpronominal object NP. Many times,
what looks at first sight like a clause-internal NP in subject or object function is
actually a presentential topic.(17)      [i n

possessors. This applies to Verbal Noun clauses (§17.4), and to the unusual
‘before …’ construction (§15.2.4.2) in which the verb has a suffix -wv$ with
underspecified vowel. Pronominal subjects are expressed by preverbal
possessor pronominals. The basic ordering pattern is (18).(18)    nominalized clause        1.   adverbials
        2.   subject (pronominal or nonpronominal), expressed as possessor
        3.   dative, object (expressed as possessor or object), adverbials
        4.   verb with nominalizing suffix     This can be summarized roughly as Adv-S(Poss)-X-V; an example is (19).
The logical subject (2Sg pronoun) is expressed as a special kind of possessor
only used with nominalized verbs, viz., independent pronoun (H-toned)
followed by Possessive ma$ (which is not used after pronominals in tensed
clauses). The object ‘chicken’ has normal object tone (rather than the tone
typical of compound initials) since it is not immediately preverbal. It is
followed by a dative pronominal (as usual, pronominals gravitate to immediate
preverbal position), then the Verbal Noun of ‘give’.(19)    u@   ma$     E$nE) @   wo$-ru@ o$-y@

2.8    Relative clausesIn relatives (chapter 14), the verb has a participial suffix of nominal type instead
of a pronominal subject suffix. There is usually an overt internal head NP whose
last word undergoes tone-dropping, but the head can be in any grammatical
relation. The head appears in its usual place in the sentence (there is no
systematic fronting of heads). If the subject is pronominal (and not the head), it
is expressed by a special L-toned preverbal subject pronominal proclitic in
immediate preverbal position. This is connected with the fact that the normal
morphological slot for pronominal-subject suffixes (at the end of the verb) is
occupied by the participial suffix (which agrees with the head NP, not the
subject). The basic order of elements is as in (20).
20     Sketch
(20)      relative clause          1. adverbials (especially temporal)
          2. nonpronominal subject NP (maximally: possessor, noun, adjectives,

          3. dative, object, adverbials (with pronominals last)
          4. L-toned pronominal subject proclitic (in nonsubject relatives, if
             subject is pronominal)

             noun (HumSg, HumPl, Nonh)
          6. NP-final elements (Definite, Plural, demonstrative, ‘all’, ‘each’)    Examples involving two or three pronominals, which show rigid dative-
object-subject order, are in (21).(21)      a. ni N

             ‘(at) the time when I fed him for you-Sg’     Let us consider (21.a) in detail. It begins with a temporal noun ‘day’ in
L-toned form, which tells us that this noun is the head of the relative. There is
then an H-toned pronominal for the object (as would be the case in a main
clause), followed by an L-toned subject pronominal (which is unique to
relatives and a few other subordinated clause types). The participial is based on
a Perfective verb, which in relatives takes the form of an unsuffixed Perfective
stem with overlaid H(H…)L tone. Since the head is Nonhuman, the Nonhuman
Participial suffix -Ø is used.
     In the interlinears, “.L” after a gloss or label indicates that tone-dropping
has occurred, and “.HL” indicates that a H(H…)L tone contour has been
overlaid. The 2Sg object (“2SgO”) pronoun here has its lexical H-tone, so the
interlinear includes no (grammatical) tonal information.
     The importance of pronominal tones in parsing relative clauses is brought
out by comparing (22.a-b). Preverbal pronominals (if not focalized or
topicalized) follow nonpronominal NPs, so 1Sg object mi@ in (22.a) and 1Sg
                                                            2.8 Relative clauses   21subject mi $ in (22.b) directly precede the verb. There is no structural case
marking of nonpronominal NPs, so ‘white person’ has the same form as subject
in (22.a) and as object in (22.b). The verb in a relative is a participle that agrees
only with the head, which is here neither subject nor object, rather the noun
‘day’. So only the tonal difference between mi@ and mi $ differentiates the two
sentences.(22)    a. ni N

           ‘the day (when) I saw the white person’     Another typologically remarkable feature of Jamsay relatives is that the
head noun is often copied after the main part of the relative clause, after a
Possessive morpheme. In other words, relatives can be double-headed (with
one internal and one external instance of the head noun); see §14.1.1. This
expanded type can be represented schematically as (23). No intelligible literal
English translation would clarify it much, but think of ‘the dog that bit me’ as
something like ‘dog of [the dog that bit me]’. Neither instance of the head noun
is pronominalized.","[40, 41, 42, 43]"

17.5.1 ‘Begin’ (tu@mno@@-)Here the upper and lower clauses share a subject, and the two clauses are
seamlessly fused. The clausal bracketings in (1062) show the logical structure,
with complements governed by the lower verb, but the surface syntactic
structure arguably erases these brackets.(1062) a. [nu^N    nu$No@]       tu@mno@-ti -$ Ø

That is, the complement is a VP containing a bare verb stem, e.g. ‘sprout’ in
(1063.a) and ‘weed’ in (1063.b).(1063) a. [ç$yç@    fu@˘] tç@ƒç@         do$go$-li@-Ø           ji $˘<

17.5.3 ‘Help’ (ba$ra@-)ba$ra@- has a range of senses including ‘help’, ‘gather’, and ‘add, increase’. In the
sense ‘help’, the simple construction is transitive [X help Y] where Y is the
person or entity helped, see line 1 of (1079). The maximal structure is
approximately [X help Y [Y VP]], where Y potentially appears as upper-clause
direct object and as lower-clause subject. In my data, Y is not repeated.
     In the most basic construction, the upper and lower verbs fuse into a serial
combination (a kind of compound verb) that can take two direct objects, one the
object of ‘help’, the other the object governed by the lower verb. One might
expect the linear ordering [[sack carry] him I-helped] for ‘I helped him carry the
sack’, but instead we get [sack him carry I-helped] with the two objects to the
left and the two verbs bunched at the right.(1064) a. [n)u@˘     ma$     sa@˘ku$]    wo@    de@˘    ba$ra$-m

           ‘He/She helped Amadou to farm a/the field.’    However, the two verbs are not always adjacent in this construction. When
we convert the entire construction into a non-subject relative clause with a
pronominal subject, the L-toned subject pronominal, such as 1Sg mi$ in (1065),
appears immediately before the final ‘help’ verb.

(all-L toned).(1066) [wo@       wa$ra$-ba$r-u@]               de$ne@-m$

purposive sense. All textual examples in the texts are given. The purposive
clause is in all cases the complement of a motion verb ‘come’ or ‘go’. The
motion verb itself is often L-toned (1071.c-e), in which case the purposive
complement is probably focal. Elsewhere, H-toned postposition le@ occurs in
626   Complement and purposive clauses
some types of locational PPs (§8.2.2), but without tone-dropping on the
preceding noun. If le@ in (1071) is equated with this postposition, it suggests a
blending of (abstract) purpose and of goal-directed motion.(1071) a. [i $ne$  [n)E$-i^-n            yç$wç$  le@] ya&˘-m$          ku$<]

             ‘I am going (there) in order to wash it.’ 2004.4.18     In (1071.a), ‘the girl’ is a direct object. A version with 1Sg patient, , has
1Sg object mi@, hence [mi@ yç$wç$ le@] ‘in order to receive me’.
     In (1072), the same construction has causal sense, denoting the initial event
that induced the protagonist to act. Being causal (retrospective), not purposive
(prospective), it is not associated with an immediately adjacent motion verb.(1072) [ko@y$   wo@           tç$˘n)ç$       le@],

17.6.1.2 ‘Intend to’ complement with Imperfective verb and le$In (1073), the verb is an inflected unsuffixed Imperfective. It is followed by
L-toned postposition le$, and by a form of the ‘be’ quasi-verb wç$-. The
specific sense of the construction is ‘intend to VP’.(1073) a. [u@ro@    ma&˘-w$<          le$]   wç$-w   de$y

           2004.5.5    In its text, (1073.b) is a slightly modified repeat of a preceding sentence
with jE@ instead of le$ in the purposive expression; see (1081.b), below.","[644, 645, 646, 647, 648, 649]"

1.1   Dogon languagesDogon is a family of languages spoken principally in eastern Mali, though some
Dogon groups have spread across the border into Burkina Faso. As a whole, the
family belongs to the vast Niger-Congo phylum, but its precise position relative
to other Niger-Congo families (e.g. Mande, Gur) is very unclear at this point.
The internal structure of the Dogon family is also very unclear, as is the number
of mutually unintelligible languages it contains.
     The French colonial administration, having little interest in small native
languages, favored (macro-)ethnic over (precise) linguistic classification, hence
“Dogon” rather than e.g. “Jamsay,” and labeled linguistic varieties within each
such macro-ethnicity as “dialects,” a tradition maintained even in current
Francophone scholarship. For similar reasons, (macro-)ethnic classification
suits African governments fine. The official language policy in Mali, for
example, is to equate “language” with (macro-)ethnicity, select the linguistic
variety spoken in a particular focal community as standard, develop pedagogical
materials in this variety, and teach it as “mother tongue” to schoolchildren and
interested adults everywhere who belong to this ethnicity. In the case of Dogon,
the Toro-So variety of the Sanga area was chosen as standard Dogon and is the
basis of government-approved literacy efforts in the region.
     Using the test of mutual unintelligibility as diagnostic, on the other hand,
there are clearly many distinct Dogon languages in Mali. We do not yet have
Dogon-wide data in a form that would permit demarcation of language
boundaries and accurate genetic subgroupings. However, having surveyed the
varieties spoken in the northern and northeastern parts of Dogon country, I can
report the following as distinct languages, using the towns of Dountza and Boni
(primarily Fulfulde-speaking) and Koro (Dogon and Mossi) as geographical
reference points:
1. Jamsay (aka Diamsay), see below;
2. Beni, spoken in Beni and Gamni south of Dianwely Maoudé, and in
Kumboy village hugging Fombori mountain between Beni and Douentza;
3. Walo, close genetically to Beni, spoken in Walo at the western end of the
long Gandamiya inselberg (on the opposite side of which is Kikara, where the
Songhay language Tondi Songway Kiini is spoken);
4. Nanga (naNa), spoken in a village cluster including Anda, Soroni,
Namakoro, Wakara, and Kono southwest of Beni and broadly east of the
2 IntroductionTommo-So (Tombo-So) speaking zone that begins at Kasa and extends to
Bandiagara;
5. Tabi-Sarinyere, spoken by the people sometimes called Tandam, east of the
town Boni (which is just off the highway, between Douentza and Hombori), in
several villages ringing the widely separated inselbergs of Tabi and Sarinyere,
plus a few small villages and one substantial one (Koyo) on the two inselbergs
framing Boni itself;
6. Najamba (= Bondu), spoken in a cluster of villages west and southwest of
Douentza including Koubewel, Adia.
     After the initial failure of government-supported instruction in Toro-So in
Dogon villages of the Douentza-Boni zone, local groups have launched literacy
programs in Jamsay and Bondu and these are now being taught in primary
schools. Aside from its own mother-tongue villages, Jamsay is being taught in
the Tabi area (whose people have long known Jamsay as a second language,
since Mondoro is not far away). The children of Beni have been attending
school in Jamsay-speaking Dianwely Maoudé, where Jamsay is of course used,
pending the construction of its own school. Jamsay is slowly acquiring the
status of a locally dominant “standard” Dogon in the Douentza-Boni region.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

10.1.2.2 Unsuffixed Perfective with all-L or H(H…)L stem toneThe unsuffixed Perfective is limited to positive clauses, and competes with the
marked Perfective suffixes (-ti -$ , -ya$/-yE$, -a^˘-) and from Resultative suffix -sa$-.
    In form, it is segmentally equivalent to the unmarked verb stem, but has one
of two syntactically sensitive overlaid tone contours (547).(547)         construction                     stem-tone          a. main clause, unreduplicated       all-L (tone-dropping)          b. main clause, reduplicated         H(H…)L contour overlaid

                                     10.1 Inflection of regular indicative verbs   345    For the H(H…)L variant in relative clauses, see §14.1.13. It is the usual
verb for any positive perfective-type aspect in relatives, being much more
common than suffixally marked counterparts in those clauses. In main-clause
verbs, overlaid H(H…)L occurs only in combination with a Ci $- reduplication
(§10.1.2.7, below).
    In main clauses, the unsuffixed Perfective with L-tone is required when
there is an overtly focalized constituent (548).(548)   a.. [i $ju$       nu@No$]=y<        la$ƒa$-m

such unsuffixed Perfectives. The AN category (perfective positive) is typically
predictable in such narratives. I suspect that this is a major reason why the
""defocalized"" unsuffixed Perfective is common in narratives. Some degree of
predictability of the verb stem’s semantic content is perhaps a contributing
factor. However, in cases like ‘stripped them off’ in (550.a), the verb denotes a
new event.
    After a quotation, ‘say’ is rather light semantically. While the basic ‘say’
verb ga@˘- has a full set of AN forms including imperfectives, there is also a
common ‘say’ quasi-verb jE$- used only in the L-toned, unsuffixed Perfective
(§11.3.2).
    All of this suggests that, within the perfective system, the unsuffixed
Perfective in main clauses is associated with verb defocalization. This is an
elusive concept, relevant to the grammars of many languages, but with much
language-specific detail. In Jamsay it involves any one of the situations in (551).(551)     a. the verb is part of a large defocalized clausal residue (when some
             other constituent is focalized);          b. the perfectivity of the verb is contextually predictable and there-
             fore defocalized (as in the middle of narratives where many events
             are recounted in chronological order, in perfective aspect); perhaps
             low information value of the verb’s own content is also a con-
             tributing factor;

17.6.4 ‘So that …’ or ‘had better’ (v# + -m)There is a purposive construction of the type (1088). Here the purposive (‘so
that …’) clause follows the main clause, or at least does so often. This sets this
construction apart from other subordinated clauses, which precede (or are
embedded in) the main clause.(1088) [main clause]     [… v# + -m]     For examples see (1091-3) later in this section. The notation [v# + -m]
means that the verb has its lexical tones (though an R-toned monosyllable may
be heard as L-toned), and is followed by an atonal suffix -m that acquires its
surface tone from the preceding morpheme. The tonal pattern distinguishes the
current construction from the Hortative, which has an H-toned -m@ suffix after a
tone-dropped all-L stem, i.e. [v$ + -m@] (§10.4.3).
     A pronominal subject is expressed with a clause-initial independent
pronoun, arguably a presentential topic.
     The sense ‘had better’ or ‘must’ is expressed by combining [… v# + -m]
with ti@la^yy$ ‘it is an obligation’ (< noun ti@la^y). We see this in the extended
passage (1089). The verb tE@mE@- ‘find’ has its lexical HH tones before -m, hence
tE@mE@-m. The HH tone contour makes it clear that this is not a plural participle
(cf. Perfective tE@mE$-m, Imperfective tE@mE@-m$), and that it is not a 1Sg subject
form (Perfective tE$mE$-m, Imperfective tE@mE@-m$).

the bush, under the watchful gaze of their elders, to demonstrate that they were
properly armed for fighting (or for taking on wild animals). The force of the
repeated tE@mE@-m is captured by ‘they had better find …’, where ‘they’ (not
expressed overtly) is generic.
      Follow-up elicitation produced examples (1090), where the subject (agent)
of ‘find’ is expressed as an independent pronoun (perhaps topicalized) at the
left.

15.2.4.1 Noun-headed temporal clause (‘the time when …’)One straightforward temporal clause is formally a relative construction headed
by a noun meaning ‘time’, ‘day’, or the like. The clause is therefore
syntactically an NP. Typical head nouns are do@gu@ru@ ‘time’, wa@ka@ti $ ‘time’
(from Arabic via Fulfulde), and ni@-Ni@r<e@ ‘day’. The following features are
required by the relative clause structure: a) the head noun appears with all-L
tone; b) an unsuffixed Perfective verb has H(H…)L, while imperfective-system
verb stems have their usual tone; and c) subject pronominals are preverbal
rather than suffixed to the verb.
    The resulting NP is optionally followed by postposition le$ in locative
function.

15.2.4.2 ‘Before …’ clauses with pseudo-causative nominalJamsay has a remarkable construction to express ‘before …’ clauses. The
propositional content may be factive (as in ‘before the rain fell, we were able to
get inside the shelter’) or irrealis (‘I managed to run away before the elephant
trampled [=could trample] me’). For its use in expressions meaning ‘on this side
of X’, see (224). The construction is characterized by the formal features in
(938).(938)   a. the verb takes the form of a pseudo-causative nominal;
        b. this nominal is followed by postposition le$ ‘in, with’;
        c. chained verbs immediately preceding the pseudo-causative nominal
              appear as L-toned compound initials;
        d. multiple NP and adverbial arguments may appear as possessors:
560     Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clauses
              —an inner argument (immediately preceding the pseudo-causative
                nominal) often appears in alienable possessor form (pronominal
                in alienable possessor form without ma$, or a noun-headed NP
                plus Possessive ma$)
              —outer arguments (not adjacent to the pseudo-causative nominal)
                often appear with Possessive ma$ not only with NPs (where ma$
                is expected) but also with independent pronouns     In its treatment of NP arguments, the ‘before …’ construction shows
syntactic similarities to Verbal Noun complements, the other major subor-
dinated clause type in Jamsay that is based on a nominalized verb (§17.4). A
subtle difference is that the VblN is more prone than the pseudo-causative
nominal to form compounds.
     The (final) verb in the ‘before …’ construction takes pseudo-causative
form, with H-toned stem followed by an L-toned suffix -wv$ (with vowel quality
taken from the final stem vowel). The overall tone pattern is therefore H(H…)L.
For the form of the pseudo-causative, see §9.3. The pseudo-causative “verb” is
morphosyntactically a noun (it is followed by a postposition, and it may be
preceded by a possessor).
     In the ‘before …’ construction, the pseudo-causative nominal is followed
by le$. Elsewhere, this is an all-purpose postposition, in context variably
locative, dative, or instrumental (§8.2.1). I will gloss it in interlinears as ‘in’, but
this is arbitrary, and there is no way to determine which of the postpositional
readings (locative, etc.) is relevant here.
     In ‘before …’ clauses based on intransitive verbs, the logical subject
appears in possessor form, hence with ma$ if a noun-headed NP (939.d-e),
otherwise with the regular H-toned alienable possessor pronominal (939.a-c,
f-h). If a chained verb immediately precedes the pseudo-causative verb, it
appears as an L-toned compound initial; see ‘come’ in (939.a) and sa@ra@- ‘pass’

subject is overtly specified, we get the same simple alienable possessive
construction as in intransitives where only the subject is expressed. This time
the logical direct object is the possessor (940). I have no examples of this
subject-less version with a pronominal object.

          (=brideprice)’ (-pa$g-u@) 2004.3.20     Now consider what happens when both the logical subject and the logical
object are overtly expressed. The linear order is normally subject-object-verb.
This ordering is common even when the subject is a pronoun (violating the
usual principle, enforced in main clauses, that preverbal subject pronominals
immediately precede the verb). It is also possible (but less common) for a
pronominal subject to follow an object (see below).
     In the normal subject-object-verb ordering, the object is the inner
(immediately preverbal) argument. It may appear in its regular (i.e. main-
clause) direct-object form, or in the form of an alienable possessor
(nonpronominal NP plus ma$, or the alienable possessor form of a pronoun).
     The subject is the outer argument in the normal subject-object-verb
ordering. It is most often treated as a special kind of outer possessor. If the
subject is a pronoun, it normally appears as an independent pronoun plus
ma$, for example 2Sg u@ ma$, 1Sg mi@ ma$, and 3Sg wo@ ma$; see (941.a-e), below.
Such a combination never occurs in main clauses, where pronominal possessors
are expressed without ma$ by either H-toned alienable possessor forms (2Sg a@,
1Sg ma@, 3Sg wo@, etc.) or L-toned inalienable possessor forms (2Sg u$, 1Sg mi $,
3Sg wo$, etc.). The only other construction where Possessive ma$ follows an
indepedent pronoun is Verbal Noun complement clauses (§17.4).
     If the object is pronominal, the object appears in either (alienable)
possessor (941.a-c,g) or regular direct-object form (941.d,f), e.g. 1Sg
possessor ma@ or direct-object mi@. The difference between possessor and object
series is audible only for the 2Sg, 1Sg, and Logophoric pronominals. Other
pronominals like 3Sg wo@ and 1Pl E@mE@ are ambiguous between possessor and
object, hence the noncommittal P/O in interlinears (941.e).(941)     a. [be@ ma$]       ma@        la@ƒa@-wa$      le$

stacked-possessor construction of the form [[subject ma$] [[object ma$] pseudo-
causative]]], as in (942). This resembles the [[pronoun ma$] [possessor-pronoun
verb]] pattern in (941.a-c), above.(942)   [mi $       de^˘]     ma$ [a@ra@    ma$     sa@˘ku$]   ma$

‘before …’ clause proper. Second, the object NP may appear in normal object

outer possessor, with ma$). The subject is realized as a simple (alienable)
possessor pronominal. This allows ‘before …’ clauses to approximate the main-
clause linearization pattern whereby pronominals (unless emphatic or
topicalized) follow nonpronominal NP’s. However, since the subject-object-
verb order is normal in ‘before …’ clauses, object-fronting may create parsing
difficulties (misidentification of subject and object roles). With verbs like
‘slaughter’ (944.a), the asymmetry between subject and object makes mis-
parsing unlikely. The reading for (944.b) is unlikely for the same reason; see the
more usual reading (941.g). (944.c) is more seriously ambiguous. My
impression is that object-fronting is uncommon in natural speech, especially
when both subject and object are pronominal.(944)     a. [pe@˘ju@   ma$]      ma@       cE@˘<-w<E$         le$

added, usually with a following Possessive ma$ (which is absent in
corresponding main clauses). Examples of pronominal and NP datives with ma$
are in (945). In (945.b-d), the pronominal subject does not have possessor form;
instead, it appears as an L-toned preverbal subject pronominal, immediately
before the verb (945.b), or as an H-toned independent pronoun, when separated
from the verb (945.c-d). The option to add Possessive ma$ after an adverb is

the tonal locative u@ro$ ‘in the house’, which occurs in the preceding sentence in

2.2    Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbsMost if not all Dogon languages are verb-final, and this is true of Jamsay.
However, the verb can be followed by clause-linking subordinators and certain
discourse particles like ‘only’ with clausal scope. In addition, some normally
preverbal constituents, especially adverbial phrases, are occasionally added (as
afterthoughts or clarifications) after the verb, with an intervening pause.
     Verb stems must respect well-defined restrictions on segmental form and
lexical tones. Regular verbs end in a long vowel if monosyllabic, in a short
vowel if longer. The stem-level lexical tone pattern of a verb can only be all-H
or L(L…)H with H on the final mora.
     In non-imperative, non-focalized main clauses, the verb has the basic
structure (2), omitting some details.(2)      [stem - (derivational suffix)] - aspect/negation - pronominal subjectBeginning with the final element, verbs are inflected for subject person and
number category (1Sg, 1Pl, 2Sg, 2Pl, 3Sg/Nonhuman, 3Pl); see §10.2. The
3Sg/Nonhuman suffix is -Ø. The pronominal subject suffix may be the only
expression of the subject, or it may agree with an unfocalized preverbal NP. In
the unsuffixed Imperfective (positive), Nonhuman subject is distinguished from
(human) 3Sg subject by adding quasi-verb kç$ ‘be (nonhuman)’ after the
regular verb stem.
                                          2.2 Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbs   11     Negation is also expressed by verbal suffixation; there are distinct Negative
suffixes for perfective and imperfective verbs, immediately preceding the
pronominal suffixes (hence verb-Neg-pronominal); see §10.1.3. Examples of
positive inflected verbs are in (3.a-b), followed by examples of negative
inflected verbs (3.c-d). Note the zero 3SgS suffix in (3.b).(3)     a. yE$rE@-m$

           go-PerfNeg-1PlS
           ‘We did not go.’    As the interlinear glosses in (3.c-d) suggest, the verbal suffixal system
marks aspect as well as negation; I refer to these as AN (aspect-negation)
categories. The positive categories are listed in (4); the fuller treatment is in
§10.1.2. The division between the two systems is justified by semantics and
textual patterning. For example, the unsuffixed Perfective (in the syntactic
contexts that require it) may correspond to any of several marked perfective-
system categories in other contexts, and the unsuffixed Imperfective is likewise
the unmarked, all-purpose imperfective-system form. Similar neutralizations
occur in negative AN categories.

               [Rdp + final L-tone] reduplicated Imperfective      In the perfective system, the unsuffixed Perfective is the basic form used in
the presence of a focalized constituent, and in relative clauses. In other
(positive) clauses, there is a choice between the Perfective (-ti$-, -yE$-/-ya$-, or
-a^˘-) and the other more specialized categories listed. In the imperfective
system, the unsuffixed Imperfective is the most common form, but it gets some
competition from suffixally marked categories. There is a relatively low-
frequency reduplicated option in both perfective and imperfective systems.
      The importance of tones in distinguishing inflectional categories, and in
distinguishing main from relative clauses, can be brought out by considering the
verb ‘fight’ (5).(5)      lexical        unsuffixed Perfective          unsuffixed Impf Imprt
                      main clause relative clause         jE$yE@       jE$yE$-     jE@yE$-              jE$yE^˘-        jE@yE@

stem in verb chains, and before non-Negative AN suffixes. The unsuffixed
Perfective undergoes tone-dropping to all-L jE$yE$- in main clauses (after a
focalized constituent), but has the H(H…)L overlay in relative clauses, where it
appears as HL-toned jE@yE$-. The unsuffixed Imperfective is underlying /jE$yE@- L/,
as a final floating L-tone follows the stem; if there is no audible pronominal
                                           2.2 Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbs   13suffix, the L-tone is grafted onto the preceding H-toned vowel. If short, this
vowel (now <HL>-toned) is lengthened to two moras to allow the contour tone
to be expressed. Finally, the Imperative is all-H-toned jE@yE@. In other words, this
CvCv- stem can appear with LH, LL, HL, LF, and HH tones. These tonal
distinctions, while occasionally redundant (LL before Negative suffix), are in
several cases the sole expression of the relevant morphosyntactic category.
      In negative indicative clauses, though some suffixally marked aspects can
occur, aspect tends to be reduced to a simple perfective-imperfective opposition,
expressed by the portmanteau suffixes -li@- (Perfective Negative) and -go@-
(Imperfective Negative); see (3.c-d), above, and §10.1.3. There is a distinct,
aspectually undifferentiated Negative suffix -la@- for adjectives and some stative
verbs and quasi-verbs (§11.4.3), and similar but L-toned Negative morphemes
(la$˘, la$) are used in a few minor constructions (§11.2.1.3-4).
      Imperative verbs (§10.4) have a distinct set of inflections for subject (2Sg
[=zero], 2Pl), and special negative (i.e. prohibitive) forms, as seen in (6) with
verb yE$rE@ ‘come’.(6)     a. yE@rE@

           ‘Come-Sg!’        b. yE@rE@-y$

           come-Imprt.Pl          ImprtNeg.Pl
           ‘Don’t-Pl come!’     There is a Hortative with suffix -m@ (10.4.3).
     There are also a handful of aspectually defective quasi-verbs meaning
‘say’, ‘be’, ‘have’, and ‘be in’ with Cv- and CvC- shapes, which are not
otherwise allowable for Jamsay verb stems. The morphosyntax of the various
elements is variable, and “quasi-verb” is an intentionally vague cover term. In
most cases they occur with L-tone in main clauses and with H(H…)L tone in
relative clauses, which aligns them formally with the unsuffixed Perfective of
regular verbs. Some of the quasi-verbs are segmentally identical to AN suffixes,
suggesting the possibility that the quasi-verb is really just an AN suffix added to
a phonologically empty verb slot. See §11.2.2-3, §11.5.1 for the full coverage.
There are also some stative stance and ‘hold’ verbs that are aspectually
defective, occurring in perfective forms only (§11.2.4, §11.5.2).
14    Sketch
    The ‘say’ verb ga@˘-, quasi-verb jE$-, and quotative particle wa (wa$, wa@)
(§11.3) constitute a complex subject in Jamsay and other Dogon languages.
Some clause-subordinating elements are based on the ‘say’ verb or quasi-verb
(§15.2.2)
2.3    ParticiplesIn relative clauses (and therefore in various spatio-temporal and manner clauses
in relative form, as well as in various agentive compounds), the verb takes a
Participial suffix instead of a pronominal subject suffix (§14.1.8). The
Participial suffixes are Nonhuman -Ø, (human) Sg -n, and (human) Pl -m.
These are the same suffixes used with most simple nouns, and with adjectives.
The Participial suffix agrees with the head of the relative, regardless of its
grammatical relation (subject, object, etc.).
     The verb in a relative clause, if perfective (positive), normally appears in a
special H(H…)L-toned form of the unsuffixed Perfective.
     Because participial agreement is with the head rather than with the subject,
in non-subject relatives some way must be found to express a pronominal
subject. This is accomplished by using a set of L-toned preverbal subject
pronominal proclitics, corresponding functionally to the subject pronominal
suffixes that occur on verbs in main clauses. (These L-toned pronominals are
not used in subject relatives, where the subject is indexed in the participial
ending.)
     Therefore the way to say ‘the place where I saw you’ can be schematized as
(7).(7)      place.L 2SgO     1SgS.L    see.Perf.HL-Ppl.Nonh    The head is ‘place’, so it appears with L-tone (“place.L”). Since this is a
nonhuman noun, we get Nonhuman Participial suffix (“Ppl.Nonh”) on the verb.
There is a 2Sg object pronominal proclitic (H-toned u@), and an L-toned
preverbal subject pronominal proclitic (1Sg mi $). Since the verb is perfective
positive, it appears in the unsuffixed Perfective, with H(H…)L tone contour
overlaid. The actual Jamsay phrase is (8).(8)      di ˘$ <   u@   mi $     E^˘-Ø
2.4    Noun phrase (NP)A full-sized NP could have the linear sequence (9), omitting some details.
                                                                 2.4 Noun phrase     15(9)     a.   possessor NP followed by ma$ ‘of’, or simple pronoun as possessor
        b.   noun stem
        c.   adjective (simple or expanded)
        d.   demonstrative or ‘each, any’ quantifier
        e.   numeral, Pl particle, and/or Definite particle
        f.   ‘all’     The noun stem itself may be a compound. Many human nouns, and
adjectives when referring to a human, take the suffix Sg -n or Pl -m. Human
nouns that for one reason or another cannot take these suffixes (e.g. most kin
terms) may be followed by Pl particle be@. Nonhuman nouns lack morphological
number marking, but they can be followed by be@ to emphasize plurality.
     An example of a fairly complex NP is (10), with the head bolded in the
interlinear. It consists of a possessor, a head noun, two modifying adjectives,
and a Pl morpheme. ‘House’ and ‘small’ undergo tone-dropping to all L-tones
(indicated by “.L” in interlinears) because each is followed by a modifying
adjective. The possessor (1Sg) and the final Pl morpheme be@ do not interact
tonally with the head noun or with the adjectives. One can therefore bracket off
an inner core NP defined by tonal interaction, as opposed to peripheral
elements that have no tonal interaction with the core (tonal independence).(10)    [ma@ [u$ro$      da$ƒa$ pi@ru@] be@]
        [1SgP [house.L small.L white] Pl]
        ‘my small white houses’      More complex examples are given in §6.1; of particular interest are
numerals, which do not interact tonally with preceding nouns and adjectives
(§6.5), and inalienable possessors for kin terms, which force a tone overlay on
the kin term itself (§6.2.2).
      In addition to tonal dependence versus independence, a further issue
relevant to internal NP structure is what happens when a multi-word NP
functions as head of a relative. For example, if (10) is a relative head, as in (11)
below, its first four words remain together (though pi@ru@ drops tones to become
pi r$ u$), but Plural be@ detaches itself and appears at the end of the relative clause,
following the participialized verb (and, usually, Definite ku$<).(11)    [ma@ [u$ro$    da$ƒa$ pi $ru$]] nu@mo$-Ø              ku$< be@
        [1SgP [house.L small.L white.L] fall.Perf.HL-Ppl.Nonh Def Pl
        ‘my small white houses that fell’    There is a partial correlation, among postnominal elements in NPs, between
such detachability and the lack of tonal interaction when adjacent. However,
16    Sketch
the correlation is imperfect; for example, cardinal numerals have no tonal
interaction with preceding nouns, but are not detachable.
     Pronominal categories are 1Sg, 1Pl, 2Sg, 2Pl, 3Sg (human), 3Pl (human),
and Nonhuman. They are expressed as subject-pronominal suffixes on verbs
(with 3Sg and Nonhuman merged as zero in most AN categories), as proclitic-
like particles preceding verbs or postpositions, and as independent pronominals.
Anaphorics include a Reflexive pronoun i n   $ i $w<e@ (§18.1), a set of expressions
of the type ‘my/your/his head’ with reflexive-like functions (§18.1.3), and a
noun-like morpheme E$nE@ (plural E$nE@ be@) that is used both for third person
reflexive possessor (‘he killed his own dog’, §18.1.2) and, in third-person
reported speech and thought, as a syntactically unrestricted logophoric pronoun
coindexed with the quoted author (‘she said/thought [she would come]’,
§18.2.1).","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38]"

13.2.3 ‘Whatchamacallit?’cE&˘ or ci $gE@ ‘thing’ is used as a ‘whatchamacallit?’ filler noun with nonhuman
reference, or as an adverbial. It is not a true interrogative morphosyntactically,
but it does have some similarity to self-directed questions, cf. French comment

and chosiner ‘do whatchamacallit?’.
    An overtly self-directed question ‘how do they say it?’ (yç&˘-ji $n ga@-ba$) may
also be used as a ‘whatchamacallit?’ phrase.
    There is no simple inflectable verb with the sense ‘do/be whatchamacallit?’.
The phrase ci $gE@ ka@r<a@-, literally ‘do (a) thing’ is used.
476     Focalization and interrogation
13.2.4 Embedded interrogativesIn this section I consider interrogative complements to main-clause verbs like
‘know’, as in ‘I don’t know (whether/who/what …)’.
    An embedded polar interrogative clause (‘whether or not …’) is a simple
quotative complement (§17.1), plus the usual clause-final interrogative particle
ma. The particle distinguishes an embedded interrogative (‘I didn’t know
whether …’) from a factive complement (‘I didn’t know that …’), although the
Jamsay embedded interrogative construction may be used (as complement of
‘know’) where English would use the factive complement. Examples are in

where English speakers would use a factive complement. This is the case in
(796.a), above, which would more naturally be expressed as ‘… who knows that
it was I …’ in a free English translation.
    Embedded WH interrogatives may be of two types. In one, the regular
WH-word is used, with optional clause-final interrogative particle ma. This
type approximates direct discourse, except for deictic substitutions such as
logophoric pronominals, where appropriate (797).(797)   a. jE$yE@-tu$-ba$      ta@Na$˘     de$y,

           ‘I don’t know how much they paid.’     This type, with the regular WH-word, is preferred for embedded ‘how
much?’ and for embedded ‘who?’. In the first case, this may be for lack of a
suitable nominal counterpart (‘amount’, ‘quantity’). In the second, the
preference may be due to avoidance of ambiguity between e.g. ‘I don’t know
who lives here’ (identificational knowledge) versus ‘I don’t know the person
who lives here’ (acquaintance).
     The second possibility for embedded WH interrogatives is the literal type
exemplified by “I don’t know the place in which he is” as the translation of
English ‘I don’t know where he is.’ That is, a generic noun like ‘place’, ‘time’,
‘manner’, or ‘thing’ is the head of a relative clause, which (as a syntactic NP)
functions as direct object of ‘know’ or other main-clause verb. There is no overt
interrogative element.

14 Relativization
14.1 Basics of relative clausesThe basic relative clause pattern has an internal head NP (marked by tone-
dropping), and a participle agreeing in gender-number features with this head
NP (rather than an inflected verb agreeing in all pronominal features with the
clause subject). Modifying adjectives and cardinal numerals remain with the
internal head NP, but some other NP-final elements (e.g. Definite ku$<, Plural
be@, universal and distributive quantifiers) follow the participle. The participle
itself therefore behaves somewhat like an adjective modifying the head noun in
several respects (recall that modifying adjectives also force tone-dropping on
the modified noun, and precede the NP-final elements mentioned above).
     It is also possible to expand this core relative clause structure (ending with a
participle and perhaps one or two NP-final morphemes) by adding a copy of the
head noun (not the full head NP), as a special kind of external head.
Specifically, this copied noun is “possessed” by the relative-clause proper,
which functions here as the possessor NP (and is therefore followed by
Possessive ma$). The complete construction may be suggested (crudely) by a
structural paraphrase, whereby ‘a/the dog that I saw’ is expanded as as ‘dog of
[a/the big dog that I saw]’, though of course the linear order in Jamsay is very
different (with the external ‘dog’ at the end). The copied external head noun is
optional, and occurs in fewer than half of relative clauses occurring in my texts,
but it is nonetheless quite well-attested.
     The internal head NP is occasionally omitted, whether or not the external
head is present. This results in an internally headless relative. However, in
such cases it is reasonable to think of a “light” head noun (such as ‘person’,
‘thing’, ‘place’, ‘time’, or ‘manner’) as being virtually present, though
phonologically inaudible. Furthermore, the participle agrees with this virtual
head: (human) Singular, (human) Plural, or Nonhuman. We can therefore think
of the agreement morpheme on the participle as a stand-in for a full head NP,
just as subject-pronominal suffixation on the verb of a main clause can function
as “subject NP.”
     Thus the maximal relative-clause construction might be described as
double-headed. However, the Jamsay construction (when examined in detail) is
rather unique, and I question how useful it would be to assign it to a general
“double-headed” typological category.
480     Relativization
     Within the relative-clause proper, the head NP remains in situ, i.e. it is not
systematically extracted to either the left or the right of (the rest of) the clause.
The head noun often happens to be clause-initial (disregarding topicalized
constituents), as is true of nonpronominal NPs in general, but it need not be so.
     Relative clauses in Jamsay are not used for parenthetical comments, as in
English nonrestrictive relatives of the type I like John, who (by the way) is in
Texas right now.
     Jamsay relatives may be definite or indefinite. If definite (‘the man whom I
saw’), they presuppose that the propositional content of the clause is true, and
known to the listener, often by virtue of preceding discourse. Since the content
is presupposed, there is a high propability that core NPs other than the
relativized NP itself will appear in pronominal form. Since pronominals (if not
topicalized or emphatic) occur in immediately preverbal position, this typically
results in clause-initial position for the (internal) head NP. Indefinite relatives
(‘a/any man who can climb this hill’) characterize an unidentified or generic
referent by the relevant proposition, which may include new nonpronominal
discourse referents, so in such relatives the head NP have no unusual
association with clause-initial position.
     Some notable features of Jamsay relatives, in addition to the use of
participles and the arrangement of (internal and external) heads as outlined
above, are the use of preverbal L-toned subject pronominals in non-subject
relatives with no nonpronominal subject NP, and the application of a H(H…)L
tone overlay to unsuffixed Perfective verbs (which generally replace suffixed
positive Perfective verb forms).
     Some important spatiotemporal and manner clauses are simply relative
clauses with a noun like ‘day’ or ‘place, manner’ as (overt or covert) head.","[497, 498, 499, 500, 501, 502]"

2.1   ProsodyPrevious published and unpublished descriptions of Dogon languages have
regularly commented that some form of lexical tone or accent is present, and
that it is subject to grammatical modification. However, no previous study has
actually analysed the prosodic system of a Dogon language.
     In Jamsay, tone (lexical and grammatical) and intonation (including
grammaticalized intonation patterns) play a central role. Indeed, I know of no
(non-Dogon) language where prosody is so tightly integrated with the
morphosyntax. Working on Jamsay has deepened my conviction that currently
dominant grammatical theories, with their sharp compartmentalization of
“phonology” and “syntax,” are badly misguided.
     The prosodic ingredients are given in (1). H[igh] and L[ow] are the
primitives of the tonal system. F[alling] and R[ising] are abbreviations for two-
part contour tones <HL> and <LH>, respectively.(1)     a. lexical tones for stems

                      —end of word preceding universal quantifier fu@˘ ‘all’       The contribution of tonal and intonational elements to Jamsay grammar is
therefore vast. Jamsay does with prosody much of what other languages do with
grammatical morphemes, or with morphosyntactic restructurings including
linear movement. Three examples: 1) most pronouns (excluding suffixes on
verbs) show no variation in segmental form across independent, subject, object,
and possessor categories, but use tones to make some distinctions (e.g. 3Pl be@
for independent, object, and alienable possessor, but be$ for subject and
inalienable possessor). 2) NP’s X and Y are normally conjoined in Jamsay
simply as [X Y], with no conjunction morpheme but with dying-quail final
intonation on both conjuncts. 3) the difference between main and relative
clauses is largely (though not entirely) expressed by tonal modifications. In
relatives, the (internal) head is not fronted. Instead, the final word of the head
NP drops its tones, a pronominal subject is expressed (in non-subject relatives)
by a preverbal L-toned pronominal, and Perfective verbs have the H(H…)L tone
overlay. There are also Participial suffixes, but since the form for Nonhuman
head is -Ø (zero), as is the 3Sg subject form in main clauses, the Participial
suffix cannot be relied on as an audible indicator of relative-clause status.
       At the lexical level, tone is also important. Most native Jamsay words are
built up with Cv and Cv˘ syllables, with a smattering of CvC and a few Cv˘C
and extra-long Cv˘˘ syllables. Cv is monomoraic (=has one mora or syllabic
weight unit), Cv˘ and CvC are bimoraic, and Cv˘C and Cv˘˘ are trimoraic. Each
mora can have its own tonal primitive, H[igh] or L[ow], so a monomoraic
syllable can be only H or L, a bimoraic syllable can be H, L, F (= <HL>), or R
(= <LH>), and a trimoraic syllable can be any of the above or bell-shaped
<LHL>. There are some minimal pairs such as di@gE@ ‘bird’s leg’ versus d i $gE@
‘row’, ç$˘r<ç@ ‘monkey’ versus ç&˘r<ç$ ‘waterskin’, and ci@rE@ ‘horn’ versus ci$rE@
‘hard wood’. Many word families include a noun and a related verb that differ
in tone. For example, the HH-toned noun bi@rE@ ‘work’ is associated with the
LH-toned verb bi r$ E@- ‘work’, and the two regularly combine in the VP bi@rE@
bi r$ E@- ‘work, do some work’.
10    Sketch
     While lexical and grammatical tones have a competitive relationship (stem-
wide tonal overlays completely erase lexical tones), there is an important sense
in which lexical and grammatical tones work together. The requirement that all
stems have at least one H makes it possible to use stem-wide tone-dropping (to
all-L) as a reliable indicator of morphosyntactic function (e.g. head of relative).
The other common stem-wide tone overlay, H(H…)L, is always audible with
verbs, whose lexical forms are tonally all-H or {LH}, and usually audible with
nouns and other stems, since only a minority of these have lexical {HL}
contours.
     The all-H tone overlay is less reliably audible in Jamsay, which has many
lexically all-H verb and noun stems. For example, there is an all-H overlay for
imperative verbs of some shapes; it is audible for lexical {LH} but not for
lexical all-H stems. However, among the various types of participle-final
agentive compounds, the type with all-H final does clearly contrast with the
others, which are based either on the unsuffixed Perfective with H(H…)L
overlaid tone or on the unsuffixed Imperfective with final-syllable F-tone.","[29, 30, 31, 32]"
"      The verb ‘enter’, though in this case abstract (i.e. ‘entering’ into a new
activitiy or technique), calls for a locative complement. In (1076), postposition
le$ ‘in’ is therefore added to a complete indicative clause (‘they shoot …’).
      A similar construction occurs with the antonym of ‘enter’, namely go@˘- ‘go
out’, in the sense ‘get away from’ or ‘abandon’ (an activity).

6.2.2     Inalienable possessionA small number of nouns that I call inalienable have the properties in (334).
The combination of inalienable noun with a nonpronominal possessor NP
behaves like one type of nominal compound (see below).
                                                            6.2 Possessives   237(334)   a. possessed noun has H(H…)L tonal overlay replacing lexical tones
        b. possessor expressed by:
                 L-toned pronominal possessor
             or: noun-headed possessor NP (without Possessive ma$)     The L-toned possessor pronominals are identical in form to the L-toned
preverbal subject pronominals (used in non-subject relative clauses): 1Sg mi $,
2Sg u$, 1Pl E$mE$, etc. (§4.3.1). These contrast with the H-toned possessor
pronominals used with alienable nouns (1Sg ma@, 2Sg a@, 1Pl E@mE@, etc.). A noun-
headed (nonpronominal) NP as inalienable possessor has its regular form
including tones, and the Possessive morpheme ma$ is absent.
     When preceded by a possessor NP or pronoun, the inalienable nouns
themselves take a stem-wide H(H…    … )L tone overlay, realized as HHL on
trisyllables, as HF on bisyllables with bimoraic final syllable, as HL on
bisyllables with monomoraic final syllable, and as F on (bimoraic)
monosyllables. This falling tone contour contrasts with the tone contour for the
same nouns in absolute (unpossessed) position, which is usually a rising
L(L…)H contour, as in ‘I have no …’. I take the absolute form to be lexically
basic. The contrast between absolute and possessed forms is exemplified by
‘father’ in (335). Two possessed examples are given, with pronominal (335.b)
and nominal (335.c) possessors. Note the absence of Possessive ma$ in (335.c).(335)   a. de&˘        sa$˘-ra@-m

           S          father.HL
           ‘Seydou’s father’    The H(H…L) tone pattern is also found in the final element in nominal
compounds of the type [x# n^] (§5.1.5). In both, the leftmost constituent
(possessor, compound initial) has its regular tones (except for the special series
of pronominal possessors with inalienables), while the rightmost constituent has
the overlaid H(H…L) tone contour. This provides tangible morphophonological
evidence for an abstract grouping of the two constructions. However, the
H(H…L) contour also occurs with Perfective verbs in relative clauses, where
238     Noun phrase structure
both the head noun and any preverbal subject pronominal drop to L-tone. A
grand synthesis of all of these H(H…L) constructions would be audacious.
     The kin terms with inalienable morphosyntax are given in (336), below.
Those not shown with Sg suffix -n do not allow -n (or Pl -m), with the
consequence that they can only be pluralized by adding postnominal Pl particle
be@, as in E$nE@ be@ na^˘ be@ ‘their (Logophoric or Reflexive) mothers’.
     The stems in (336.a) show tonal but no segmental changes. They are
ordered by increasing syllable and mora count. Those in (336.b) involve a
change of final vowel in addition to the tonal change. Those in (336.c) require a
human suffix (Sg -n, Pl -m) when possessed, except that ‘friend’ has Sg tE^n
(apparently with frozen *-n now part of the stem) and Pl tE@n-u$m. ‘Grandchild’
and ‘master’ (336.d) are already H(H…)L, and ‘grandchild’ already has a
human suffix, so there is no audible change in the possessed forms. (336.e)
illustrates how the compound finals a&-n ‘man’ and n)E&-n ‘woman’ are outside of
the scope of the overlaid H(H…)L tone contour, which is realized on the
compound initial ti $rE$-.(336)         gloss                     absolute      H(H…)L possessed form          a. tonal change only

one (‘comrade’) has H-tone, and the others (n=13) have a rising tone contour
with L-tone followed by a single H-tone component on the final mora. This
latter tone pattern is well-designed to maximize the distinctiveness of the
H(H…)L tone overlay in the possessed form. yE$sa&˘ ‘(man’s) sister’ is unique for
a CvCv˘ noun stem in having a LR tone pattern; see (110.a) and cf. §3.7.4.6.
The exceptional noun tç@w<ç@ ‘comrade’ is also unusual in that it has both
alienable and inalienable possessed forms, e.g. mi $ tç^˘-n alongside ma@ tç@w<ç@-n
‘my comrade’.
      Kin and similar relational terms that are treated as alienable include ju@˘ro$
‘twin sibling’, i^-n ‘child’ when used in the kinship sense ‘son or daughter’ (it
also has non-kinship uses), n)E&-n ‘woman’ in the possessed sense ‘wife’, and
tç@ƒç@rç$ ‘namesake’ (<Fulfulde). By definition, these nouns show no tone change
after possessors, and take the regular H-toned pronominal possessors, including
1Sg ma@ and 2Sg a@.
      ba@Na$ ‘owner’ is usually a compound final, but it may also be used with
inalienable possessor; see (283) and discussion there.
      The other noun taking inalienable possessors is ce@ ‘possession’. This is a
grammatically specialized noun, probably related to the regular noun ci g    $ E@ or
cE&˘ ‘thing’, used in ‘whose (is it)?’ interrogatives and as a dummy NP-head with
a possessor when no lexical noun is present. The latter construction is the one
that is relevant here (337). ce@ differs from other inalienable nouns in two
respects: a) it does not occur without a possessor, and b) it does not adopt
{HL} tone contour.(337)       form          gloss            mi $ ce@      ‘mine’ (= ‘my possession’)

            E$nE@ ce@     ‘his, hers’ (logophoric or reflexive)    ce@ has a nonpronominal possessor, in normal inalienable form without
Possessive ma$, in (338).

          2004.3.24    Recursion is of course possible with inalienable (as with alienable)
possession. In recursive inalienable possession, both kin terms appear with the

          [1SgP.L      father.HL]   aunt.HL
          ‘my father’s aunt’     In the combination of a nonpronominal NP possessor and a following
inalienable noun, both the possessed noun and the final word of the possessor
NP have at least one H-tone. When the larger syntactic context requires tone-
dropping, both drop their tones simultaneously to all-L, as explained above.
This is a general rule that also applies to compounds with H-tones in both initial
and final. For example, inalienably possessed sa@ydu$ tE^n ‘Seydou’s friend’
drops its tones in (340.a), since it is followed by NP-internal modifiers.
Likewise, when recursive inalienable possession is present, both possessed NPs
drop their already overlaid H(H…)L tones. This is seen in (340.b), where the
NP in question drops its tones as head of a relative.(340)     a. sa$ydu$  tE$n          i $ne$   ga&-n

                                                              6.2 Possessives   2416.2.3   Independent pronoun plus ma$ in subordinated clauseIn certain complex morphosyntactic constructions, instead of the usual simple
pronominal possessor (with alienable or inalienable noun), we get an
independent pronoun followed by Possessive ma$. We can tell that it is an
independent pronoun (H-toned), rather than an alienable possessor pronominal
(also H-toned), because the 1Sg form is mi@ ma$ (not ma@ ma$) and the 2Sg form
is u@ ma$ (not a@ ma$), these being the two pronominal categories that have distinct
forms as independent pronoun and as alienable possessor.
      This pattern is observable in ‘before …’ clauses. There is a (pseudo-
causative) “verb” form with suffix -wv$, but this word is treated syntactically as
a noun. If just a subject, or just an object, is expressed, the relevant NP takes
(alienable) possessor form. When both a pronominal subject and any object
(pronominal or not) are expressed overtly, the result is normally of type (341),
with m a$ even after a pronominal subject, which takes independent-
pronoun form). (The form of the object NP or pronoun is not at issue in the
current section.) See (941-2) and discussion in §15.2.4.2.(341)   independent.pronoun(subject) ma$ Object verb-wv$ …","[258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263]"

            mE@˘<-   ‘be ground up’         mE$˘<-nE@-    ‘grind up’    The n of the -nv@- suffix seems to have had something to do with the
idiosyncratic deletion of the medial rhotic in (531.a) and of the medial N in
(531.b). Some irregular nouns may have likewise lost a medial rhotic before Sg
-n. In any event, the loss of a medial consonant creates an intermorphemic
vowel sequence that must be contracted. See VV-Contraction (90) (§3.5.6.2).
    The rather lexicalized ga$˘-na@- ‘take across’ competes with a regular
causative ga$ra$-wa@- ‘allow to go across’, with a slightly different nuance.
    I suggested just above that the type su@go@- ‘go down’, causative su@nu@-No@-
‘take down’ (528.d), may involve underlying suffix allomorph -nv@-. We will see
below that -nv@- is common in deadjectival verbalizations.
9.3                             w v$ -)
      Pseudo-causative “verb” (-wIn addition to true causatives (whose productive suffix is -wv@-), there is a
phonologically similar pseudo-causative derivative that is used in a special
type of ‘before …’ clause, with no actual causative element in the meaning. For
the syntax and many examples, see §15.2.4.2.
     The “verb” in this construction is actually a nominal syntactically. It
always ends in L-toned -wv$, and takes no suffixes (whether pronominal-
subject, AN, or Participial). The vocalism of the suffix (and of the preceding
syllable) is accounted for by Suffixal Vowel-Spreading (57) and Presuffixal V2-
Raising (59) (§3.5.2.1-2), exactly as with the suffixally derived verbs covered
elsewhere in this chapter. However, the pseudo-causative does not respect the
constraints on tones applicable to the lexical forms of inflectable verb stems.
Instead, regardless of input lexical tones, the entire stem has H-tones, while -wv$
itself is L-toned. This is consistent with the H(H…)L tone overlay (§3.7.3.2).
     Examples of pseudo-causative verbs used in the ‘before …’ construction
are in (532). If the input verb has a true causative, the latter is shown on the
right for comparison. However, while the pseudo-causative is completely
productive, many verbs have no true causative in common use. (532.a) has non-
nasal monosyllabic inputs. (532.b) has monosyllabic inputs beginning with a
nasal, hence -w<v$- suffix by Nasalization Spreading (§48). (532.c) has
bisyllabic inputs with two identical vowels. (532.d) is similar to (532.c) but also
has a nasal that triggers Nasalization Spreading (48). (532.e) has bisyllabic
inputs with high followed by mid-height vowel. (532.f) has trisyllabic inputs.
(532.g) is based on a poorly assimilated Fulfulde borrowing with disharmonic
[u E] vowel sequence, and shows that such stems do not raise the second-
syllable vowel.

9.4     Passive verbsThere is no productive passive, mediopassive, or antipassive suffixal derivation.
A passive sense is often conveyed by a transitive construction with a ref-
erentially vague subject, often 3Pl ‘they’, so ‘he was killed’ is expressed as
‘they killed him’ (wo@ wç&˘-tu$-ba$). This is used, for example, with na$r<a@-
‘(woman) bear (child)’, less often ‘(man) sire (child)’, so that ‘he/she was born’
is expressed as ‘they bore him/her’ (wo@ na&n-tu$-ba$), cf. (555.a) in §10.1.2.3,
below. The “passive” construction with impersonal 3Pl subject is not common
in main clauses with verbs other than ‘bear’. A similar impersonal 3Pl subject
occurs in a productive participial compound type producing instrumental
nominals (‘oil that they rub’ = ‘oil for rubbing’); see §5.1.15.
                                                              9.4 Passive verbs   333    Since most transitive verbs have no derivational passive, they just use their
ordinary stem-shape in (medio-)passive as well as transitive function. In other
words, they are “ambi-valent”; see §9.5, below.
    Suffixal passive derivatives are attested for a handful of common verbs
(533).(533)   a.   tE@mE@-   ‘(come and) find’   tE@mE@-w<E@-   ‘be found (regularly)’
        b.   bE$rE@-   ‘obtain’            bE$rE$-wE@-    ‘be obtainable (regularly)’
        c.   E@˘-      ‘see’               E$˘-wE@-       ‘be seen’
        d.   ga@˘-     ‘say’               ga@˘-wa@-      ‘be said, be sayable’     The suffix is -wv@-, identical to the productive Causative suffix. Nasalized
-w<v@- is of course due to Nasalization-Spreading (48). The only irregularity is
the {LH} tone pattern of E$˘-wE@-. Compare e.g. be@˘- ‘remain’ but be$˘-we@- ‘cause
to remain’ (526.a) (§9.2, above).

verb rather than the lower verb is passivized.

9.5     Ambi-valent verbs without suffixal derivationVerbs that can be used intransitively or transitively, without suffixal derivation,
are here termed “ambi-valent” (with a hyphen).
     In Jamsay, the mediopassive type predominates. If the intransitive case
frame is [X VERB], the transitive frame is [Y[X VERB]], where X is the direct
object and a new agent is added. Depending on the verb, one could argue that
either the transitive or intransitive verb is lexically basic. In (536.a), ‘become
dirty’ is probably basic with ‘make dirty’ a semantic causative, but in (536.b),
‘do’ is arguably basic with intransitive ‘be done’ a semantic mediopassive.(536)         verb           intransitive gloss      transitive gloss          a. lç@ƒç@-jç@-     ‘become dirty’          ‘make dirty’
          b. ka@r<a@-        ‘be done’               ‘do’     In the antipassive type, the transitive verb is conceptually basic. The
antipassive intransitive construction simply omits the object, usually because it
is obvious (implied by the verb) or generic (537).(537)         verb          intransitive gloss transitive gloss          a. sE@mE@-        ‘sweep (up)’          ‘sweep (e.g. courtyard)’
          b. si@rE@-        ‘cook’                ‘cook (a meal)’     The tendency in Jamsay is to have a default direct object noun, often cog-
nate to the inflected verb. Thus in Jamsay one doesn’t “sing,” one “sings (a)
song” (nu^N nu$No@-); one doesn’t “eat,” one “eats a meal” (n)a&˘ n)E@˘-); one doesn’t
“work,” one “works (a) work” (bi@rE@ bi r$ E@-); one doesn’t “stutter,” one “stutters
(a) stuttering” (i^m i@mE@-). Where semantically appropriate, these inflected verbs
may also be used with more specific objects (e.g. singing a particular type of
song), in which case the default object is omitted.

            ‘coarse’       ku$nu  ) @      ku@no  ) @-   ku@nu ) @-wo@-     The inchoatives in (538) do not involve a -CV- suffix like those in the other
verbal derivations of this chapter. There is no mechanical way to derive the
inchoatives from the adjectives, or vice-versa. However, the form of the
inchoatives is partially explicable in terms of basic constraints on the shape of
inflectable verbs (§3.4.4-5, §3.7.1.2). The inchoative is therefore vowel-final, as
are all Jamsay verb stems (except for one quasi-verb, ku$n- ‘be in’). In (538.a-c)
the final vowel of the inchoative is segmentally a copy of the vowel of the
preceding syllable, even when the adjective has a different final vowel, namely
u (538.b). In (538.d), the factitive predictably has a high vowel in the medial
syllable (Presuffixal V2-Raising (59)).
     In (538.a,d), and in ‘hard’ (538.b), the factitive is clearly the morphological
causative of the inchoative, with the productive Causative suffix -wv@-
(becoming -w<v@- if preceded by a syllable beginning with a nasal or a nasalized
consonant).
     In (538.c), on the other hand, the factitives are constructed by adding -nv@-
to the consonant-final adjective. It is difficult to understand the tonal patterns
336     Verbal derivation
if we directly compare the adjectives and the -nv@- derivative. The data in
(538.c) seem to show that the inchoative verb is tonally independent of the
adjective, just as verbs and cognate nominals are often tonally unrelated. The
factitive is consistent in these cases with the inchoative rather than with the
adjective. The same is true for ‘ripe, cooked’ in (538.d).
     In many other cases, I have recorded a single form used indiscrimately in
both factitive and inchoative functions. The most common and versatile deriva-
tional suffix is -nv@-, which appears after Cv˘-, CvCv-, and CvC- stems

Causative suffixal allomorphs, although the primary Causative allomorph -wv@-
is strikingly absent. If we accordingly take the factitive (i.e. semantically
causative-like) function as basic, we could think of these as a special case of
mediopassive-type ambi-valent verb §9.5, above).
     In §3.5.1.2, I present the case that a metathesis of r…-n to n…-r, followed
by automatic Nasalization-Spreading (48), is behind the strange-looking
consonantal alternations pairs in (539.d). ba$na$-r<a@- (539.e) is synchronically
opaque, but the n in adjective ba@n ‘red’ derives historically from *r<, so this
originally involved the same type of metathesis as in (539.d).
     For ‘sweet; sharp’ I also recorded a factitive with double suffix
e$ne$-r<e$-w<e@- in the sense ‘make sweet or pleasant’.
     wa$na$-Na@- in (539.g), from wa$ƒa@ ‘distant’, is parallel to causative su@nu@-No@-
‘take down’ from intransitive su@go@- ‘go down’ (528.d). These unusual
consonantal alternations suggest an underlying suffix /-nv@-/, and derivations
involving metathesis (§3.5.1.2) and an irregular extension of Nasalization-
Spreading (48).
     Inchoative/factitive o@no@r<o@- from trisyllabic adjective o$nu$r<u@ ‘sleek’
(539.h) is difficult to model phonologically, since a syllable seems to have been
truncated. Alternatively, o$nu$r<u@ could be analysed as the (regular) Verbal
Noun (o$nu$r<-u@) of the verb o@no@r<o@-, which would then be lexically basic. The
same issues arises with the two stems glossed ‘crooked’.","[352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358, 359]"

8.5.6     MannerAdjectives are occasionally used like adverbs, but this may require iteration. For
example, the adjective ma&y< ‘dry, hardened, stiff’ has an adverbial counterpart
whose minimal form is the singly iterated ma&y<-ma$y< (expandible with further
L-toned iterations). It means ‘with difficulty’ as a manner adverbial. In this type
of iteration, tones are often dropped on the noninitial occurrences.(503)     dç$ƒç&-m ma&y<-ma$y<-ma$y<-ma$y< sa$ri^˘ cE$jE$-ba$

begin with’, reflecting the order of elements to be presented in a discourse, with
the temporal adverbial ‘first’, reflecting the order of eventualities narrated. The
latter sense is relevant to this section. For the pragmatic adverbial ‘firstly’ (i.e.
‘to begin with’), see ti@, see §19.3.1.
     pç@˘rç@, which can also be used as an ordinal adjective ‘first’ (human Sg
pç@>rç@-n), has adverbial function in cases like (508). (If pç@˘rç@ were an ordinal
adjective here, it would be the final word in its NP, and would appear in
L-toned form since this NP is the head of a relative clause).(508)     u$ro$    pç@˘rç@     be$           ma^˘-Ø

14.2.2 AgentivesSome subject relatives, generally consisting of a simple Imperfective participial
verb without complements, function as agentives.
     An example is verb da$na@- ‘hunt’, unsuffixed Imperfective stem da$na^-,
Agentive da$na@-n$ ‘hunter’ (Pl da$na@-m$). There is no formal difference between
‘hunter’ and the imperfective relative clause ‘one who hunts’ (§4.2.3).
     However, we can partially distinguish agentives from ordinary subject
relatives when the agentives are extended by incorporating an object noun, or
other complement or adverbial. Here a true agentive takes one of two tone
contours, each associated with a type of noun-noun compound. One type
(§5.1.7), identical in form to subject relatives, is [x# v^-Ppl], where the (loosely)
incorporated element x has its regular tone, and the participial verb has
H(H…)L tone (850.a). The other type (§5.1.9, with many examples), clearly
                                                   14.3 Object relative clause   509distinguishable from ordinary subject relatives, is a more tightly fused
[x$-v@-Ppl], where the incorporated element has its tones dropped to all-L, and the
verb shifts to all-H tone (850.b).(850)   a. u$-ju$w<o@     da@na$-m

14.3 Object relative clause14.3.1 Ordinary object relative clauseIn object relatives and other non-subject relatives, if the subject is not expressed
by a nonpronominal NP, it appears as an L-toned subject pronominal
immediately preceding the participle. An example is (851), which also
illustrates the H(H…)L tone contour on the unsuffixed Perfective participle.(851)   [cE$˘     u$         bi@rE$-Ø]               ce@˘n-a^˘

        ‘what you-Sg have accomplished is very good’    More nonhuman object relatives are in (852). The head noun and the
Participial suffix are bolded in interlinears. L-toned preverbal subject
pronominals appear in most of the examples, and are italicized in interlinears.
These subject pronominals make it relatively easy to identify the head NP as the
object. In (852.c), however, both subject and object are expressed as
nonpronominal (i.e. noun-headed) NPs. Clues that ‘cattle’ is the object, rather
than subject, are: a) the Nonhuman zero suffix on the participle, b) the fact that
nonpronominal NPs follow subject-object order, and c) the subject-object
animacy asymmetry of the verb ‘chase, drive ahead’.

an additional external head is (800.e), involving a cognate nominal.
    See also the discussion of object relatives functioning as instrumental and
similar compound-like nouns (‘oil for rubbing’) in §5.1.15.
14.3.2   ‘what they call “X”’The verb ga@˘- ‘say’ may be used in a special type of object relative. This
construction is very common in interview-style texts where an expert speaker is
explaining e.g. agricultural techniques, and periodically introduces technical or
archaic vocabulary. Jamsay ‘what they call “X”’ can be freely glossed as ‘so-
called X’. The subject is 3Pl (nonspecific referentially), the verb is a participle
based on Perfective ga^- with H(H…)L contour, and Definite ku$< is regularly
added. With zero suffix, ga^- is lengthened by ga^˘-Ø by Contour-Tone Mora-
Addition (141). The quoted term has its normal tones, and is therefore not the
head NP. Therefore, when no obvious object NP is present, as in (853.a), a zero
object functioning as relative head is posited. In (853.b), an object NP ‘women’
(the third word in the example) is an overt direct-object head. The quoted term
is therefore an adjunct and is neither relative head nor direct object.(853)    a. ko@y$       [mo$n)u-$ cE&m     be$      ga^˘-Ø             ku$<]

14.4 Relative clause from ‘it is’ clitic constructionThe construction [Xy$] ‘it is X’ and its negation [Xy$ la$˘] (§11.2.1) allow the
predicative constituent X to be relativized on. The negative version occurred (as
part of a double negative) in a text (854); examples given earlier are (360.a-b).

          [tree.L    medicineit.is] be.Nonh-Neg
          ‘There is no tree that is medicine.’    This example is structurally interesting. ‘Tree’ shows the tone-dropping
typical of relatives. Since a relative clause is at hand, there should be a
Nonhuman Participial suffix -Ø. However, there is no verb, or even a quasi-verb
capable of taking Participial suffixes. This is “finessed” in (855), since the
relevant Participial suffix is phonetically inaudible (zero). What happens when
we force the issue by using a human head NP? Consider the simple ‘it is’ clause
(856).(856)     n)E&-n       ç$ƒç$-ni^˘
          woman-Sg chief-Sgit.is
          ‘A woman is (the) chief.’     When I tried to elicit a relative clause version, as in ‘there is no woman who
is chief’, informants altered the construction rather than put Singular Participial
-n on the clitic y$ (allomorph i^˘). They either used compounds (e.g. ‘there is
no woman-chief’), or switched from relative clause to factive complement
(857).(857)     [n)E&-n        ç$ƒç$-ni^˘]       kç$˘-rç@
          [woman-Sg      chief-Sgit.is]    be.Nonh-Neg
          ‘That a woman be chief, it does not exist.’    Note that ‘woman’ in (857) does not undergo tone-dropping; it is in the
form of a main-clause subject (or topic) rather than a relative-clause head. I
conclude that there is a morphological constraint against combining y$ ‘it is’
with nonzero Participial suffixes, but that relatives with nonhuman head are
allowed (“tolerated” might be a better word) since their zero Participial does not
force the constraint to be audibly violated.

based on the negative ‘it is not’ construction, since here the Participial suffix is
added to Negative la$˘ (allomorph la$-) rather than directly to the ‘it is’ clitic.
Therefore in (858) ‘woman’ appears in tone-dropped form, as head of a relative
clause.(858)   [n)E$-n        o$ƒç$-ni^˘  la$-n]          kç$˘-rç@

14.5 Possessor relative clausePossessor relatives are covered here, since their structure is relevant to the
discussion of relatives based on complex postpositions (§14.6.2, below).
     Three constructions are possible for possessor relatives. In the first,
recorded once in a text, the possessor noun undergoes tone-dropping. Possessive
ma$ is not present. In (859), i n    $ e$ ga$sE$gE@ could be mistaken for a compound
(L-toned initial, lexical-toned final), but this would make no sense. Perhaps this
uncommon first construction is a slightly truncated version of the third (see
below). If so, i n
                 $ e$ and ga$sE$gE@ in (859) should be considered as two constituents
that just happen to be adjacent, rather than as constituting a single constituent
(possessed NP).(859)   sa$na@      [i n

        ‘Is it necessarily (=specifically) the people whose animals they (=Fulbe)
        have driven off (=rustled) [focus] who get up (and fight the Fulbe)?’
        2004.4.25     In the second construction, obtained in elicitation (see below), the regular
possessed NP phrase [X ma$ Y] ‘the Y of X’ is preserved intact, except that (as
relative head) the possessor X undergoes tone-dropping (860.a).
     In the third construction, observed in a text and in elicitation (see below)
and evidently the productive pattern, the possessor is extracted (or at least
separated) from the possessed NP phrase and placed to its left (not necessarily
directly adjacent). This possessor NP (as relative head) undergoes tone-
dropping. Its original place within the possessed NP phrase is occupied by a
resumptive third person possessor (Singular, Plural, or Nonhuman) in its
514     Relativization
regular form (H-toned for alienable, L-toned for inalienable possession). The
resumptive pronominal is not Reflexive/Logophoric in form.
    In elicitation, my assistant gave (860.a) and (860.b) as interchangeable.
(860.a) has the second construction with [X ma$ Y], while (860.b) illustrates the
more common third type showing extraction and a resumptive possessor
pronominal.(860)     a. [i n

examples the extracted possessor is adjacent to the pronominally possessed
noun. (861.e) is an elicited example involving an inalienable noun. The
possessed NP happens to be a subject in (861.a-c), the complement of a
postposition in (861.d), and a direct object in (861.e).(861)     a. bu$ro$    [ko@      le$gu@] E@ju$-Ø

separated from the possessor by an adverb (862.a) or by another NP (862.b). In

14.6 PP relative clause14.6.1   With simple postpositionIn PP relatives, only the NP complement of the postposition is logically
relativized on, as is brought out by English translations with stranded
prepositions (‘the housex that I live in __x’). However, in Jamsay, both the
postposition and the complement NP undergo tone-dropping. The usual
general features of relativization are also applicable: Participial suffix on the
verb agreeing with the head, preverbal L-toned subject pronominal, and
H(H…)L tone overlay on a (positive) unsuffixed Perfective verb.
     The first set of examples (863) involve the all-purpose postposition le$
(§8.2.1). Since le$ is already L-toned, we cannot observe audible tone-dropping
on it, but tones are audibly dropped on the preceding noun (or noun modifier).(863)    a. [cE$˘      le$] la@˘    ko$         tu@mno@kç$-Ø

witn n). All cases of N, n), r<, and w< follow nasal or nasalized C2. Factoring this
out, we note a high incidence of r, w, j, and g (in descending order of
frequency). These correspond nicely to the consonants in the derivational
suffixes we have considered (-rv@- for reversive and a few causatives, -wv@- in
causatives, some causatives in -gv@- and -jv@-). Moreover, the associations of
these suffix allomorphs with particular C2’s, commented on in the sections
above, recur here. This suggests that most of the synchronically underived
trisyllabic verbs not borrowed from Fulfulde originated as suffixal derivatives.
     Strikingly absent from C3 position in the sample of one hundred verbs are
many consonants that occur as C1 in this same set of verbs. The data for C1
(excluding Fulfulde causatives) are: b = 8, c = 5, d = 6, g = 4, j = 6, k = 12, l
= 6, m = 1, n = 2, p = 9, s = 9, t = 4, w = 6, y = 5, and zero (vowel-initial) = 11.
Therefore stops {b g j} and sonorants {n w} occur both as C1 and as C3; stops
{c d k p t}, sibilant s, sonorants{m N y) occur as C1 but not as C3; while r
(which is very rare initially) and nasalized sonorants {w< r<} (which cannot
occur word-initially) occur as C3 but not as C1.
340   Verbal derivation
    Also of interest is the very high incidence of C2 = g (28). Other C2’s in the
sample (excluding Fulfulde causatives) are j = 5, l = 4, m = 5, n = 7, N = 11, p
= 1, r = 18, and r< = 7.
    Another, more synchronic way to look at it is that there are subtle patterns
of favored consonantal sequences that apply (as constraints) to unsegmentable
stems, and are enforced by allomorphic choices and phonological rules on
suffixally derived stems. Except for g and j, for example, stops and affricates
are very common as C1 but very rare as C2 or C3.
10 Verbal inflection
This chapter covers inflectional categories relevant to verbs: indicative AN
(aspect-negation) suffixation (§10.1), pronominal-subject suffixes (§10.2),
postverbal morphemes that fine-tune the temporal values of AN suffixes
(§10.3), and special imperative and hortative suffixes (§10.4).
    Not covered in detail in this chapter are the following: a) defective quasi-
verbs translatable as ‘be’ and ‘have’, and other defective statives; b) adjectival
and nominal predicates (some of which include a quasi-verb). These are
presented in Chapter 11.","[361, 362, 363]"

17.6.3 Reduced purposive clause in compound form (n$ v^)We now turn to a (more or less) purposive construction with a sharply reduced
subordinated clause in the form of a noun-verb compound, functioning
syntactically as a noun (suggesting that the “verb” has been nominalized). The
noun is L-toned and the verb (in bare-stem form) has overlaid H(H…    … )L tone.
The main clause which follows has a motion verb (‘come’, ‘go’, ‘enter’). The
stance verb ‘sit down’ is also allowed, but here too the motion component is
probably relevant.
    Examples from the texts are in (1082). Note that the subject of the stance or
motion verb is identical to the (unexpressed) subject of the purposive clause.(1082) a. … n)E@˘-ba$,     n)a$˘-n)E^˘     di N

             ‘if you-Sg go (to the fields) to farm’ 2004.4.4 [< (1280)]     In (1082.e), the purposive a$ma$-sa$w-ku@no$ is embedded in a larger
compound involving the (agentive) participle of ‘come’. This outer compound
is of the type [x# v^-Ppl] (§5.1.7).
     The L-toned noun and (nominalized) H(H…)L-toned verb are suggestive of
a perfective relative clause with L-toned head noun and H(H…)L-toned
unsuffixed Perfective participle. However, the purposive compound does not
allow the preverbal L-toned subject pronominals that are regular in relatives,
and there are other formal and semantic differences that make a conflation
impossible. A tonal similarity to the rare agentive compound type ya$˘-yE@rE$-m
‘go-and-come women’ (§5.1.8) is suggestive, but again there is no semantic
connection.
     Definite ku$< is uncommon after the purposive compound, but it occurs in

construction at hand. Given that the main clause has a motion verb, it may be
that the noun-verb compound is interpreted by native speakers as locative,
hence ‘go (in-)to [meal/eating]’, parallel to the more transparently locative
‘enter into [brick-making]’.
    Though redundant, given that the purposive clause and the motion or stance
verb have the same subject, a possessor denoting the subject of the purposive
clause may be added (1085).(1085) a. [a@    be$re$-tE@rE$]        nu@˘-w$<

3.5.2     Vocalism of suffixally derived verbsThe major derived verb categories are expressed by adding a suffix with un-
specified vowel (Reversive -rv@-, Causative -wv@- and other allomorphs, pseudo-
causative -wv$) to the input stem (which is usually a verb, occasionally an
adjective or a noun).

above: stem must end in a non-high short vowel, and the stem-wide vocalism
must involve either identical vowels or an acceptable harmonic sequence.
    To account for the derived verbs in terms of traditional phonological rules,
we assume that the suffixal vowels are underspecified, and recognize the
processes in (54).(54)      a. Suffixal Vowel-Spreading
          b. Presuffixal V2-RaisingThe two processes must be ordered as given.

from the tones of the input simple verbs, see §3.7.3.1, below.","[74, 75]"

18.4.1 No leftward antecedent-reflexive relationshipThe possessor of a subject NP may not function as antecedent for purposes of
reflexive anaphora, and is not itself eligible to be a reflexive anaphor. Instead,
we get regular third person pronominal marking both for the possessor (if
pronominal) and for a following non-subject, as shown in (1136). This example
was elicited in parallel with e.g. ‘my dog bit me’ to make it clear to the
informant that coindexation was involved. Of course (1136) also has a second
reading where the two 3Sg pronominals are not coindexed.(1136) [wo@       i $ju@]    wo@        cE@t-ti -$ Ø

18.4.2 No antecedent-reflexive relation between coordinandsConjunctions of the type [X and X’s Y], and disjunctions of the type [X or X’s
Y], do not allow the possessor in the right coordinand to be expressed by a
Reflexive pronoun, regardless of whether the entire coordinated NP functions as
subject. Instead, ordinary third person possessors (3SgP, 3PlP) are used even
when the possessor of the right coordinand is coindexed with the left

proper. Therefore (1141) has simple 3Sg possessor wo$ (inalienable) rather than
Reflexive E$nE@ ma$. In other words, a topical NP does not count as “clause-mate
subject” for this purpose.(1141) [a@˘ma@du$      ke@]

18.4.4 Reflexives in complement clausesX and Y in the formulae below are understood to be other than first or second

    Consider a construction [X VERB1 [Y VERB2 [ __’s Z]], using English
order to clarify grammatical relations, where VERB1 is a control verb taking a
subordinated clause with VERB2. In Jamsay, if the NP in the blank possessor
position is coindexed with either X (higher subject) or Y (clause-mate subject),
the possessor has reflexive form. This accounts for the ambiguity of (1142),
where E$nE@ may have either ‘Amadou’ or ‘my father’ as antecedent.(1142) [mi $    de^˘]        [a@˘ma@du$ [[E$nE@ nE@r<E$]   ma$     i^-n]

18.4.5 Reflexives in causative clausesIn (1144), we see that the sense [X cause [Y to VERB [Y’s Z]]], expressed with
a single verb as [X Y [Y’s Z] VERB-Caus], does not allow Y to serve as
antecedent for a reflexive possessor. Therefore we get 3Sg possessor wo@ rather
than Reflexive E$nE@. In other words, the fact that Y is the (underlying) subject of
a clause does not count for purposes of antecedent determination in this case.(1144) a. [wo@      n)a&˘]    wo@      n)E˘$ -w<E$-m

‘his meal’, Jamsay listeners infer that the meal belonged to the mother, see
(1145). That is, causative clause-union creates a structure with only the higher
subject capable of functioning as antecedent for the possessor of a non-subject
NP in the remainder of the clause.","[681, 682, 683, 684]"

3.5.4.2        Inter-Word u-ApocopeIn addition to these word-internal examples, there are frequent instances of
u-Apocope at word boundaries, when the following word is C-initial. These
instances of apocope have a syncope-like flavor, since the environment for
deletion is of the type vC_#Cv straddling the word boundary #. u-Apocope is
not obligatory in these cases. When it does occur, Stranded-Tone Re-Linking
may be necessary (often resulting in an R- or F-tone on the pre-apocope
64     Phonology
syllable, §3.7.4.5, below). Moreover, the specific flanking consonants play a
role. I will describe two basic subtypes, then discuss morphosyntactic restric-
tions on them.
     In one subtype, u at the end of a bisyllabic word is apocopated between
velar stops. In (68.a), the noun tç$gu@ ‘kind’ is followed by ka^˘< ‘each’. In
(68.b), sa$gu@ ‘entrusting (someone)’ is followed by ga@˘- ‘say’.(68)         full form      apocopated       gloss         a. tç$gu@ ka^˘<    tç&g ka^˘<       ‘each kind’ 2004.3.1
         b. sa$gu@ ga@˘-    sa&g ga@˘-       ‘say words of entrusting’ 2004.3.11     A common source of the relevant phonological environment is the com-
bination of a noun with following Definite ku$<. Example: to@gu$ ku$< ‘the (same)
shed’, often apocopated to to@g ku$<.
     This apocope does not occur in the final syllable of a trisyllabic noun:
yu$ru$gu@ ‘fox’, yu$ru$gu$ ka^˘< (not #yu$ru$g ka^˘<) ‘each fox’. This suggests that
metrical factors are at work (§3.2.2, above).
     Another construction favorable to u-Apocope between velars is the
predicate adjective construction with Nonhuman subject, e.g. [ADJkç$] ‘it is
ADJ’. Optional u-Apocope is observed with ç@gu$ ‘fast’ before velar stop, hence
ç@gkç$ ‘it is fast’ (phonetic [ç@k˘ç$]. Similarly, o$˘gu@ go@˘-yE$-m ‘I sweated’ (noun
o$˘gu@ ‘sweat’, go@˘-yE$-m ‘I went out’) is often apocopated to o&˘g go@˘-yE$-m.
     The sequence /gk/ produced by apocope in some of the examples above,
e.g. (68.a), is frequently pronounced kk (i.e. [k˘]).
     While the apocopated vowel is normally u, I have also recorded ju$g-go@-w
‘you-Sg do not know’ as a variant of ju$gç$-go@-w. The high-frequency
combination ju$gç@- ‘know’ and Imperfective Negative -go@- can also be idio-
syncratically contracted to jç$˘-go@-, so this verb is not a reliable guide to regular
phonology.
     Apocope of u between homorganic stops (or nasals) at a word boundary is
uncommon when the consonants are not velars. I have noticed no instances
involving labials. The noun bu@˘du$ ‘riyal (currency unit)’ tends to reduce to bu^˘d
before a numeral beginning with a stop or nasal (not necessarily homorganic).
These are high-frequency combinations, several of which can be considered to
be names of coins. Examples: bu^˘d nu&˘y< ‘five riyals’ and bu^˘d pE@ru@ ‘ten
riyals’. Apocope between palatoalveolars is uncommon, but I can cite gu&j-jE^m
‘black-skinned’ as a variant of gu$ju@-jE^m (a bahuvrihi compound), and
[cE$j-Ø]-[cE$j-u@] as a variant of [cE$j-u$]-[cE$j-u@] ‘for cutting’, a compound (used
as an adjective) consisting of an iterated VblN of cE@jE@- ‘cut’.
     The second major subtype is an inter-word counterpart to Post-Sonorant
Syncope (60), a process that applies word-internally as it was formulated above.
                                                3.5 Segmental phonological rules    65In the inter-word counterpart, a bisyllabic word loses its final u if this is
preceded by an unclustered r. Elsewhere r< patterns phonologically like r, but
this time it does not; informants rejected apocope of words ending in …r<u. For
example, contrast e$r<u@kç$ ‘it is plump’ with the very common e@rkç$ (from
e@ru$) ‘it is sweet’. Were …r<u to apocopate, it would be realised as …n by
Derhoticization (§3.5.5.1), as it is word-internally after Post-Sonorant Syncope
(60). Speakers seem to resist Derhoticization in inter-word cases.
      The most frequent cases of ...ru subject to apocope at a boundary are 2nd
and 3rd person dative pronominals ending in -ru@, when followed directly by a
verb. Apocope is most common when the verb begins with another coronal, but
I have several textual examples where the u is apocopated before a non-
homorganic consonant. 3Sg Dative wo$-ru@ becomes wo&-r before t in (69.a), a
very common result, but (69.b) shows that the same 3Sg Dative form
apocopates at least occasionally to wo&-r before g, and (69.c) shows a similar
apocope of yi $ru@ ‘garment, clothes’ before b.(69)    a. [bE$r-i^˘<    nE$]    wo&-r         ti@me@-sa$-Ø

           ‘You-Sg will tell her that you’re sick.’ (wo$-ru@) 2004.3.3        c. ci@n    dç$ƒç&-m    yi&r   bE&t-tç@ƒç$-ba$
           thus    Dogon-Pl clothes get-Impf-3PlS
           ‘That [focus] is how Dogon people get clothes.’ (yi $ru@, bE$rE@-)
           2004.3.14    In (69.a), wo&-r is actually pronounced [wo&t] with r assimilated to the initial
t of the following word, though (for the sake of morphemic transparency) I
transcribe the pre-assimilation form.
    Apocope does not occur with trisyllabic stems. For example, I have never
observed apocope with do@gu@ru@ ‘time’, hence do$gu$ru$ ka^˘< (not #do$gu$r ka^˘<)
‘each time’.
    The two dative pronominals not ending in -ru@ are 1Sg mi&-n and 1Pl E$mE&-n.
These were probably once *mi $-ru@ and *E$mE$-ru@, or rather (with Nasalization-
Spreading) *mi $-r<u@ and *E$mE$-r<u@. If so, for these first person datives, the
original apocopated variants mi&-n and E$mE&-n, with n replacing the disallowed
syllable-final r< by Derhoticization (76), have now generalized.
    Adjectival predicates with Nonhuman subject (§11.4.a) provide additional
cases of apocope after the rhotic: ç$ru@ ‘fresh’ and predicative ç&rkç$ ‘it is fresh’;
66     Phonology
e@ru$ ‘sweet’ and predicative e@rkç$ ‘it is sweet’. Note that k is not homorganic to
r. The relationship of this type of u-Apocope to Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) is
brought out by the failure of long-voweled je@˘ru$ ‘bitter’ and of trisyllabic
o$nu$r<u@ ‘smooth, sleek’ to apocopate: je@˘ru@kç$ ‘it is bitter’, o$nu$r<u@kç$ ‘it is
smooth’. For the tones in e@rkç$ and je@˘ru@kç$ see Rightward H-Spreading
(§3.7.4.4).
      In compounds, the boundary between the initial and the final is usually
treated as a word boundary phonologically. Inter-Word u-Apocope (and Rhotic
Assimilation (77)) may become lexicalized in common combinations. An
example is bE$n-na@˘ ‘she-goat’, cf. bE$ru@ ‘goat’.
      Having described the two major subtypes of Inter-Word u-Apocope, I now
consider the morphosyntactic environments in which they regularly occur (70).
It should be noted that no inflected verb, or bare verb stem, ends in u (see
§3.4.4), so no combinations beginning with a verb are candidates for apocope.(70)     a.   compound

except in well-established compounds, Inter-Word u-Apocope is an optional
process; unapocopated variants are not shown here. The transcription is nearly
phonetic, but at true word boundaries I do not indicate the frequent assimilation
of word-final r to a following coronal, e.g. in yi&r te@˘re@- (71.b), which is usually
heard as [ji&t˘e@˘re@] with [t˘].(71)     a. compound

             bo@ru$ ‘(sb’s) uncle, ti@ri@wE$-n ‘grandchild’ [... bo@r] ti@ri@wE$-n    Regarding (71.d), complex numerals are compound-like sequences subject
to (morphophonological) lexicalization. In decimal terms (‘10’ to ‘90’), which
begin with pE@ru@- ‘ten’, apocope occurs in pE@t-ta$˘n ‘thirty’ but not in pE$ru$-su^y<
‘seventy’. What may be happening here is that numerical adjacency (as
reinforced by out-loud recitation) is the mother of phonological similarity. ‘70’
shares an aversion to apocope with the ’60, ‘80’, and ‘90’, while ‘30’ shares a
receptivity to apocope with ‘20’, ‘40’, and ‘50’. These two subseries of decimal
terms also differ in tones (§4.7.1.3).
    The strongest aversion to apocope is at the boundary between two NPs
(excluding the case where the first is an inalienable possessor). Apocope
between ‘uncle’ and ‘shed’ was therefore rejected in (72). Contrast this with
(71.h), above, where the same [mi $ bo@ru$] ‘my uncle’ does apocopate when it
functions as inalienable possessor, i.e. as a kind of loose compound initial.(72)    [mi $    bo@ru$]     to@gu$     to@go@-ti $-Ø
        [1SgP.L uncle.HL] shed          build.shed-Perf-3SgS
        ‘My paternal uncle built a shed.’
68     Phonology
    My assistant also rejected apocope between ‘one’ and ‘show’ in (73),
although some other cases of [word + verb] do apocopate, as indicated above.(73)     [u@ro@   tu@ru@]  te@˘re@-ti -$ Ø
         [house one]       show-Perf-3SgS
         ‘He/She showed one house.’    The problem here may be that tu@ru@ ‘one’ is bracketed with ‘house’. In the
other cases where a word apocopates directly before a word, it is a cognate
nominal, a simple noun, or a dative pronominal; all of these are liable to
function either like compound initials or like (pronominal) proclitics.
    My assistant also rejected apocope before discourse marker sa&y ‘only’, and
before sa$- ‘have’ (in the negative form sa$˘-ra@-, which can directly follow an
object noun). Therefore he did not accept apocope in (74), even in sentences
where the elements shown are presumably bracketed together.(74)     a. be$-ru@     sa&y

the sense ‘know how …’ (952.a) or ‘know how to …’. The latter is expressed as

this 3Pl as impersonal ‘one’ in (952.b).(952)     a. E$nE@y$< [di $˘<     ko$     ka@r<a@kç$]   ju$gç^˘

The noun does not typically function as head of a relative clause, but it is
combinable with a manner adverbial clause headed by the L-toned version of
d i&˘< (see above).(953)     [di ˘$ <       ka@r<a@ me$y ko@     be$        do$no$-No^˘-Ø]

to determine in this case whether the missing head noun is ‘manner/way
(that …)’ or ‘time (when …)’. Perhaps a locative sense ‘place (where …)’ is
also possible, though I can cite no compelling textual examples. Contextual
information and any available native wit must be used in translating such
headless adverbial relatives.
     In (954), because of the immediately following ‘how?’ question, I opt for
‘the way …’ in the free translation, though a temporal reading is also possible.(954)   [i@ne@-m      be$          a^˘-Ø                    ku$<],

15.2.8 ‘From X, until (or: all the way to) Y’The verb ya$Na@ ‘take, pick up’ is widely used to initiate (and continue) a series,
especially in the combination ya$Na@ me$y<. It can take an NP or a clause as
complement. The series is normally concluded with a phrase containing some
combination of ha^l ‘until’, ya&˘- ‘go’, and/or dç@˘- ‘arrive, reach’. The trope is
therefore of the speaker ‘picking up’ one or more objects and going (with it) to
a destination.
     One version of the complete construction is seen in (956.a), with two ya$Na
me$y< opening the series of life stages of the millet plant, and a final ha^l ya&˘.

The ladles and necked gourds form a mini-series, coming from fruits of the

bringing in watermelons.(957)   in$ e$        ka$ju@        wa@ra$-m            be@y$,

15.3 Constructions with superfluous m a$15.3.1 Narrative-climax construction with ma$ plus H(H…)L PerfectiveIn narrative climaxes, it is possible to shift to a highly marked construction
ending in an unsuffixed perfective verb in H(H…)L tone (as in relatives). We
also find Possessive ma$ connecting various preceding constituents in a
somewhat profligate fashion. A pronominal subject is expressed by an
independent pronoun preceding ma$. A chained verb preceding the H(H…)L
verb has its tones dropped to all-L, in the fashion of a compound initial.
Frequently two such clauses are paired, the first of which undergoes intona-
tional prolongation ().
                                     15.3 Constructions with superfluous ma$   573    Some of these features suggest affinities with Verbal Noun complements
(§17.4.1) and ‘before …’ clauses (§15.2.4.2).
    A free translation with ‘suddenly’ or the like captures the narrative flavor.
When two such clauses are paired, a rapid-fire chronological sequence is
suggested, as in line 4 of (963). The contextual translation is ‘no sooner did …
than …’.(963)   ya$Na@       be$        ka^n en France ya&˘        me$y<

        pi@li@we@-) 2004.4.22    The subject of ‘arrive’ and ‘go back’ nominals is expressed as a possessor,
specifically as an independent pronoun (here 2Sg u@) plus Possessive ma$.

        ‘No sooner did Amadou sit down than he died.’ (di$Ne@-, nu@w<o@-)    Consider now (965). The first clause (‘got up’) is of the same type as in
(963-4), i.e. H(H…)L verb with preceding …ma$, and denotes a sudden action.
After a second clause (‘was holding’) whose form is not relevant here, the
passage concludes with a long third clause of the same type as the first
(‘brought down’). What is interesting about this third clause is that each
constituent is linked to the following by Possessive ma$. Excluding one case
where ma$ occurs in its normal function within a possessed NP, the third clause
may be schematically modeled as [he ma$ top ma$ stick ma$ brought down], i.e.
‘he (suddenly) brought down the stick on the top’. When one does include the

16 Conditional constructions
16.1 Simple conditional with d ey (de$ y , de@ y , de @ ) ‘if’The unmarked simple conditional clause is of the form [S1 dey, S2]. In this
construction, S1 denotes an eventuality that has occurred, does occur, or may
occur. The pitch of dey is variable. When clause-final, it behaves as an atonal
morpheme, which then copies the final tone of the preceding word, see Atonal-
Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137). Because of the way H- and L-tones pattern
with AN suffixes, in practice we get de@y after negative verbs (if not
defocalized) and after lexical-stem pseudo-participles, but de$y in the more
common combination with a preceding positive verb.
     When non-clause-final (i.e. when followed by another particle), the basic
form is H-toned de@y. In some high-frequency combinations this simplifies to de@
(§16.1.3).
     Both antecedent and consequent clauses have main-clause form in the
great majority of cases, so their verbs have pronominal suffixes as appropriate.
dey occurs at the end of the antecedent clause, which normally precedes the
consequent, though occasional textual examples of postposed antecedent
clauses (probably afterthoughts) have turned up. The construction is very
common, and one can often translate dey as ‘when …’ instead of as ‘if’. In
other words, [S1 dey, S2] may simply indicate chronological ordering, as in the
description of a complex activity involving multiple sequential actions, so long
as there is some connection between these actions (a necessary sequencing, for
example). The [S1 dey, S2] construction therefore competes with the explicitly
temporal [[S1 (ga@˘) ka^n], S2] construction (§15.2.2.1).","[588, 589, 590, 591, 592, 593, 594, 595, 596, 597, 598]"
"Given the Constraint Against All-L-Toned Stems (99), one could consider the
possibility that one or another of the attested lexical tone patterns is a default,
applied to underlying L-toned stems in order to satisfy the constraint. I do not
favor this (pure) constraint-satisfaction model, but if I did I would suggest final-
mora H-tone as the default. In this view, which I will call the default-final-
mora-H analysis, verbs with (monosyllabic) R, bisyllabic LH, trisyllabic LLH,
and so forth, are reinterpreted as having no lexical H-tone, with the final mora
secondarily acquiring H-tone to satisfy the constraint. The same would apply to
nouns, adjectives, and numerals that have L-tone up to a final H-toned mora.
    Possible evidence for this applicability of the default-final-mora-H
approach to nouns is provided by a small numer of human nouns that normally
(and in some cases exclusively) occur with Sg -n or Pl -m. The stems in
question have a final R-tone in these suffixed forms, and the suffixal nasal is
required to permit expression of the H-tone component of R (i.e., <LH>). The
four known examples are ç$ƒç&-n ‘chief, Hogon’, sa$ƒa&-n ‘chief’s subordinate’,
dç$ƒç&-n ‘Dogon (person)’, and su$rgç&-n ‘weaver’ (plurals ç$ƒç&-m, sa$ƒa&-m,
dç$ƒç&-m, su$rgç&-m). ‘Chief’ has an unsuffixed form ç$ƒç@ ‘leader (e.g. of animal
pack)’, with final H-tone replacing R-tone, and ‘Dogon’ has an unsuffixed form
dç$ƒç@ meaning ‘Dogon language’, while ‘chief’s subordinate’ and ‘weaver’ do
not occur without suffixes. In the default-final-mora-H analysis, these stems are
underlying all-L /ç$ƒç$/, /sa$ƒa$/ , /dç$ƒç$/, and /su$rgç$/, and the final mora secon-
darily acquires H-tone, for example in unsuffixed ç$ƒç@ and in suffixed ç$ƒç&-n.
    A theoretical objection to this argument is that e.g. unsuffixed ç$ƒç@ ‘leader’
can also be derived from /ç$ƒç&/ by a simple tone rule converting R to H tone on a
final monomoraic syllable; see Final-Cv R-to-H Reduction (154), §3.7.4.6,
below.
    Additional grist for this debate comes from tonal relationships between
underived and suffixally derived stems; see below, §3.7.3.1.
    In the sections that follow, I will suggest an autosegmental model for
Jamsay tone, while acknowledging the existence of a few counterexamples to
the rules proposed. In its strongest form, an autosegmental model of tone
separates the segmental tier from the tonal tier. Strictly speaking, the seg-
mental tier must itself be organized into syllables, moras, and feet, but since
these are derivable from the segment string I will speak loosely of these as
elements of the segmental tier.
    A stem, or a word, consists of non-null strings of segments and of tone-
components. Curly brackets {…} will be used for strings of H and L com-
ponents at stem or word level. For example, u@ro@ ‘house’ consists of uro at the
segmental level and {H} at the autosegmental level, while its tonal locative u@ro$
                                                                    3.7 Tones   97‘at the house’ has the same segments but a bitonal {HL} tone pattern. Both the
segmental and tonal tiers may be morphemically complex.
     For this model to work perfectly, there must be rigorous association
processes that connect the tone components H and L to the correct syllables
and/or moras. These processes are easy to formulate when the tonal tier is
monotonal, i.e. just {H}, since of course in this case the H component will
associate to all syllables (and moras) at the segmental level; i.e., it will spread
throughout the stem or word. The rules are also easy to formulate when the
number of tone components, the number of syllables, and the number of moras
all converge, for example bitonal {LH} for a CvCv stem. Complications arise
with bi- or trimoraic syllables, since now the association rules must decide
whether to associate tone components with syllables or with moras. The
challenges increase to the extent that the number of tone components is mis-
matched with the number of relevant segmental-tier units (syllables or moras).
For Jamsay, no pure autosegmental model will work perfectly for all word-
classes. However, it is possible to develop a model that works well for verbs,
and that helps explain statistically important patterns for nouns.","[118, 119]"
"     Inalienably possessed nouns (with nonpronominal possessor NP) and
certain types of compounds have at least one H-tone in both the left and right
component when they occur NP-finally (more precisely, when they are not
followed by a modifying adjective or demonstrative). Examples include
compounds with final ba^˘< (ba@Na$) ‘owner’ or its plural na@m (§5.1.12). When
such an NP functions as relative head, the left and right components undergo
simultaneous tone-dropping.
     Unless the entire head NP is omitted (“headless” relatives, see below), the
NP-final word targeted by relative-clause tone-dropping is either a noun or a
postnominal modifier. If there is a postnominal adjective and/or a postnominal
demonstrative (nu@No$ ‘that’), this postnominal modifier will have already forced
tone-dropping on the preceding word (a noun, or another postnominal
adjective). For example, an NP of the form [dog big that] is already expressed
as [dog.L big.L that] in main clauses, as each nonfinal word drops its tones
under the influence of the immediately following modifier. Therefore the only
change the NP undergoes as relative head is that the final word, here the
demonstrative ‘that’, also undergoes tone-dropping, resulting in [dog.L big.L
that.L].
     Examples where just one word undergoes tone-dropping due to
relativization are in (809). These are cases where the NP (excluding alienable
possessors) does not end in two tonally independent elements.(809)     a. [E@mE@      dç$ƒç&-m]      [gu$ju@   le$]

functions as relative head, the adjective also drops its tones. In (809.c-d), the
alienable possessor pronoun (ma@, ko@) is unaffected by the tone-dropping that
applies to the noun ‘house’.
     In a [noun + numeral] sequence, in ordinary clauses both the noun and the

of a relative, both the noun and numeral drop their tones (810).(810)   a. [n)E$-m      ku$ro$y] yE@rE$-m                   ku$<

when functioning as relative-clause heads: possessor plus inalienable noun such
as a kin term (811.a), compounds of type [x# n#] where neither the initial nor the
final changes its tones in a main clause (811.b), [x# n^] compounds where the
488     Relativization
final has an overlaid H(H…)L tone contour while the initial retains its lexical
tones (811.c), and compounds whose final is ba@Na$ (ba^˘<) ‘owner’ or its plural
counterpart na@m following a lexical-toned initial (811.d).
     In (811.e), however, we have a combination including a numeral following
a kin term plus Pl be@. Normally be@ would appear after the participle. However,
in the combination be@ plus numeral, be@ is trapped inside the clause-internal
head NP. It does, however, resist tone-dropping, as does the following numeral,
although the preceding head noun and its inalienable possessor noun do undergo
tone-dropping.

application of regular relative-head tone-dropping (which would force flat low
pitch). In elicited data, the dying-quail intonation was regularly maintained on
the left conjunct. The right conjunct usually (but not always) underwent tone-
dropping. See §7.1.1.5 for examples and discussion.

      A pronoun may not head a relative. Instead, the pronoun is placed to the
left in its independent form (with H-tone), in apposition to a proxy noun, either
human i@ne@ ‘person’ (812) or nonhuman cE&˘ ‘thing’. The independent pronoun is
external to the relative clause proper. Tone-dropping applies to the proxy noun

14.1.5 Relative clause with conjoined NP as headWhen the head of a relative is a conjoined NP, expressed by dying-quail
intonation on both conjuncts, the left conjunct has its regular tones plus the
dying-quail conclusion. The right (=second) conjunct most often takes ordinary
tone-dropped form with no intonational prolongation (814). However, other
treatments of the right conjunct are possible; see (417) and surrounding dis-
cussion.(814)     [n)E&-n      a$-n]       yE@re$-m                 ku$<

14.1.6 Internally headless relative clauseInternally headless relatives with no overt head NP within the clause are also
possible. In most such cases there is also no external head noun, but see (802)
above for the occasional internally headless but externally headed relative type.
The omission of a head NP is similar to the omission of the (implied) noun in
headless NPs (§6.1.2).
     (815) illustrates headless subject relatives. The full expansion of (815.a)
would have i@ne@ ‘person’ as overt head, while those of (815.b-c) would have cE&˘
‘thing’ as head, the head taking L-tone form in each case (i$ne$, cE$˘). In (815.d), a
pronominal conjunction ‘you and them’ (§7.1.3) is in apposition to three
headless subject relatives with ‘people’ as implied head.(815)     a. ç$w<ç$-sa&y<    do$˘-go@-m                   ku$<

             ‘if they (=healers) treat (people) for sickness’ 2004.3.27     The phrase a@ma$ jE@ means ‘for (the sake of) God’, or more freely ‘in the
name of God’, as a motive for doing a good deed.
     After a focalized constituent, I recorded L-toned jE$. The relevant example is
(754) in §13.1.5. Both the fact that jE@ allows Focus clitic y$ to attach to the
complement NP, and the dropping of tones to jE$, suggest a (perfective) verb-
like status for this “postposition.”
     A verb-like status is also suggested by (475), where jE@ following a noun is
itself followed by me@y ‘and’. (475) is from a text about mice traps constructed
by balancing an inverted wooden bowl on a palm-leaf bowl cover, with an
opening for the mouse.(475)     u$-ju$w<o@   [[ko$     n)a&˘     ku$<] jE@       me@y]

          gone in (under the bowl itself) because of (=in order to get) the food,
          …’ 2004.3.16     These data suggest a connection between “postposition” jE@ (Purposive or
Causal) and the defective quasi-verb jE$- ‘say’, whose inflected forms are limited
to the unsuffixed Perfective. For jE@ and jE@ me@y at the end of adverbial clauses,
see §15.2.2.2, especially discussion of (931.a-b).","[323, 324]"

19.5.2 Clause-final ko$yThis particle is added to the end of a sentence as a mild emphatic. Similar forms
occur in Fulfulde and some Songhay languages.(1174) a. n)E&-m      yE@       de@˘-ra$-ba$          ko$y

             ‘They (=grasshoppers) do not completely disappear.’ (do$g--u@)
             2004.3.8    When an original utterance ending in Emphatic ko$y is quoted, Quotative
particle wa precedes ko$y. The result is therefore [S1 wa ko$y], where S1 is the
basic proposition in the original utterance. An example is (1003).
                                                                   19.5 Emphatics   67919.5.3 Clause-final de@This particle occurs with slight phonological variation in all languages of the
zone, and is even used in local French. It seems less common in Jamsay, where
it may be a fairly recent borrowing.
    In (1175.a), the speaker responds with a trace of irritation to a vague
question about what kinds of song-and-dance festivities there are. In (1175.b),
the negation is emphatic.(1175) a. dç$ƒç$-cE$r<E$w<E@   ma$ si^˘      ji -$ jo^˘                de@

19.5.4 Clause-final ‘(not) at all!’ particles (pE@y, so@y, fE@s)Various clause-final emphatic particles, pronounced as interjections, occur in
emphatic negatives like (1176).(1176) be@           [gu$ju@-jE@mu$˘               de$y],
       3Pl           [skin-black.HLit.is-2Sg       if],

       ‘They (=Algerians) [topic], if you-Sg are a black-skinned person (=an
       African), your situation (=behavior) is not at all important to them.’
       (gu$ju@-jE^m [bahuvrihi], be$-ru@) 2004.5.4     This is the only occurrence of pE@y in my recorded texts, though I have
heard it in conversation. Elicitation brought out two other particles with similar
’(not) at all’ uses, fE@s and so@y. For so@y, whose more general sense is ‘all,
entirely’, see cf. §8.5.8.7.
     fE@s is unusual in ending in a sibilant, a possibility restricted to interjections
(and poorly integrated borrowings). fE@s itself resembles ‘(not) at all’ particles in
some other languages of the region (e.g. Humburi Senni).
680   Grammatical pragmatics
19.5.4.1 Emphatic construction with verb plus topicalized related nominalThis construction has truth-value emphatic function, as when an assertion is
reaffirmed to a skeptical audience, or when someone lays down the law to a
child or other subordinate about what will or will not happen. The discourse
flavor can be approximated by adding ‘sure as hell’ or the like to the free
translation.
    A nominal related to the verb (perhaps a Verbal Noun) is followed by
Topicalizing particle kE@ (§19.1.1), then the inflected verb form (1177.a-b).
There is no prosodic break between the “topical” phrase and the verb,
suggesting that the topical constituent is clause-internal. Where both a Verbal
Noun and another cognate nominal are available, either may be used (1177.c-d).
For verbs like ‘fight’ that are regularly accompanied by a cognate nominal, my
assistant did not accept a proposed version where the cognate nominal and the
Verbal noun (i.e. as a compound Verbal Noun) both occurred (1177.e).(1177) a. [da&g-Ø             ke@]    da$ƒa$-j-e@

uptake checks, where the speaker tests whether the listener is paying attention,
or whether uptake of a difficult passage has occurred.
    As in all local languages, expressions of the general type ‘did you (not)
understand?’ are frequently used by some speakers. The listener is expected to
respond in some way, at least by gesture or grunt. In texts from an older man,
such forms as (1179) were common.(1179) pa@˘mE@-r<a$-w<                 la$˘
       understand-Habit-2SgS           Neg
       ‘Is it not (the case) that you-Sg understand?’     In this pronunciation, pa@˘mE@-r<a$-w< is a slightly irregular variant of
pa@˘m-a@˘r<a$-w<.
     Another backchannel checking phrase, used by a different speaker
occasionally in a long recording, was (1180).(1180) ga$˘-lu@-m
       say-PerfNeg-1SgS
       ‘I did not say …’ (= ‘Did I not say …?’)    In (1180), the preceding discourse is taken retrospectively as a quotative
complement. Though there is no overt marker of interrogative status, (1180) is
evidently interrogative in function: ‘did I not say (…)?’
19.7 GreetingsA greeting sequence begins with an expression relevant to a given time of day
(good morning, good evening, etc.), or to an activity that the initial addressee is
engaged in or returning from (in a field, at a well, at work, arriving at a house,
etc.). The ABAB… sequence is initially asymmetrical (with “adjacency pairs”
consisting of a greeting and a well-defined response) but then may blur into a
symmetrical interaction where essentially the same highly general greetings are
exchanged. ta$˘re@ is used to bring a sequence (or sub-sequence) to an end, but
this may lead to a relaunch of the greeting cycle.
     (1181-2) are examples of morning greeting sequences.","[700, 701, 702, 703]"

6.8     Universal and distributive quantifiers6.8.1    ‘Each X’ (ka^˘<) and ‘all X’ (cE^w, fu@˘, so@y)Three forms are relevant here. Distributive quantifier ka^˘< behaves like an
adjective (or compound final), forcing tone-dropping on a preceding noun. It is
best glossed ‘each, every’, and occurs most often in simple NP’s consisting just
of [noun (+ adjective) + ka^˘<]. It does not co-occur with determiners
(demonstratives, Definite) or with other quantifiers such as cardinal numerals. It
must be distinguished from homonym ka^˘< ‘also, too’ (variant ka@r<a$), which
occurs freely after a wide range of NPs (and other constituents) and has no tonal
effect on the preceding word (§19.1.3).
      Universal quantifiers cE^w and fu@˘ (the latter also pronounced pu@˘ after a
nasal) are more emphatic, may be glossed in context as ‘all’ or less often ‘each,
every’, and occur at the end of the constituent they have scope over. cE^w and
fu@˘ do not force tone-dropping on a preceding nonpronominal NP. However, fu@˘
does induce the dying-quail final intonation (symbol ), i.e. prolongation and
exaggerated falling tone, on the preceding word when it modifies a
nonpronominal NP (§3.8.3): u$r<o@ fu@˘ ‘every hole’, roughly phonetic [u$r<o@o#o$
fu@˘]. The  effect is usually omitted, but occasionally audible, in pronominal
combinations, e.g. [ko$() fu@˘] ‘all of it, everything’.
      Both cE^w and fu@˘ force L-tone on a preceding pronominal (but not noun):
E$mE$ cE^w or E$mE$ fu@˘ ‘all of us’. ‘Everything’ is expressed by [ko$ ce^w] or [ko$
fu@˘], where ko$ can be taken as the tone-dropped counterpart of Nonhuman
pronoun ko@, or (less likely) as the prenominal demonstrative ko$. 1Pl E@mE@ is
often apocopated before fu@˘, with the f then hardening to p after the nasal: E$m
pu@˘ ‘all of us’. fu@˘ is sometimes itself prolonged intonationally: fu@˘. An
elicited example is (381), where fu@˘ shifts to pu@˘ after a nasal. I have difficulty
in text transcriptions determining when the intonational marking  is justified
for fu@˘, since universal quantifiers are naturally emphatic.(381)    u@r<-u$m pu@˘             ya&˘-ya$-ba$

258     Noun phrase structure
    My assistant did not accept sentences where a “floating” cE^w or fu@˘ (in
adverbial function) is separated from the relevant NP constituent by another
element. Thus, ‘I gave him all the money’ is expressed with the ordering
[[money Def all] 3Sg-Dat give.Perf.L-1Sg] ([bu@˘du$ ku$< fu@˘] wo$-ru@ o$˘-m),
rather than as #[[money Def] 3Sg-Dat all give.Perf.L-1Sg] (#[bu@˘du$ ku$<]
wo$-ru@ fu@˘ o$˘-m) with the quantifier “floating” into preverbal position.
However, a topical NP like ‘the money’ in (382) may be resumed by a
pronominal plus quantifier.(382)     [bu@˘du$ ku$<] wo$-ru@ [ko$          fu@˘] o$˘-m
          [money Def] 3Sg-Dat [Nonh.L all] give.Perf.L-1SgS
          ‘The money, I gave him [all of it].’      i@ne@ ‘person’ requires a suffix (Sg -n, Pl -m) when unmodified, and
specifically requires Pl -m before cE^w and fu@˘, hence i@ne@-m cE^w and i@ne@-m
fu@˘ ‘all people, everyone’. By contrast, this stem appears as i n
                                                                 $ e$ without suffix
(and with tones dropped) before ka^˘< ‘each’, hence i $ne$ ka^˘< ‘each person’. A
possibly related quirk is that i n $ e$ ka^˘< is sometimes applied to nonhuman
entities in the sense ‘each one’ (383).(383)     ya$˘-gç$˘-na@˘            [ko@  lE$y] tu$l-la@-Ø,

          ‘(Calabash dance and) the true women’s dance [topic], the two of them

          (tu@ru@) 2004.4.14    Other human nouns keep Sg suffix -n (NB: not Pl -m) before ka^˘< ‘each’, as
in dç$ƒç$-n ka^˘< ‘each Dogon’ and n)E$-n ka^˘< ‘each woman’.
    (384) shows that all three quantifiers can be used at least loosely in
distributive sense. The version with ka^˘< (384.a) is clearly predominant in this
context (if the noun has no other modifiers). However, if special emphasis is
placed on the fact that every single person was given a sheep, a singular
countable noun may be followed by cE^w or by fu@˘.(384)     a. [i $ne$    ka^˘<   le$] [pe@˘ju@ tu@t-tu@ru@]     o$˘-ba$

as cardinal numerals (387). In simple cases the universal quantifier is emphatic
here, stressing that the predication applies to every one of the elements in the set
defined by the other quantifier (387). For more complex examples, see §6.8.4,

be made by observing the linear order of elements in the elicited examples
(388.a-b).

17.4 Verbal Noun (and other nominal) complementsThe Verbal Noun has suffix -y@ after a monosyllabic stem, elsewhere -u@. The u@
is lost under some conditions, by Suffixal u-Apocope (67) after a sonorant
(§3.5.4.1). A Verbal Noun may be formed from any regular verb, but not from
defective quasi-verbs like wç$- and kç$ ‘be’, or sa$- ‘have’, nor from stative
stance verbs confined to inflected perfective forms such as da$˘<- ‘sit’. Verbal
Nouns are formed directly from uninflected verb stems, one consequence of
which is that there are no negative Verbal Nouns.
     A Verbal Noun (or other nominal denoting an action), can be used in a
complement clause, as the following sections will demonstrate. The Verbal
Noun may be accompanied by a full range of internal arguments, so we should
really speak of a Verbal Noun clause.
     Verbal Noun phrases may also function as regular arguments of verbs. In
(1041), the Verbal Noun phrase is the subject of ‘arrive’.(1041) [[e$ju@  le@] wo@    go$-y@]          dç@˘-ya$-Ø       de$y, …

17.4.1 Structure of Verbal Noun PhraseThe structure of a Verbal Noun Phrase may be summarized as in (1042).(1042) a. the verb is nominalized as a Verbal Noun;
       b. an immediately preceding chained verb appears as an L-toned
              compound initial;
       c. an unmodified object noun usually appears as an L-toned
              compound initial:
          —very common with cognate nominal or generic object (§11.1.6);
          —possible for a a wider variety of object NPs when preceded by a
              subject NP (in possessor form)
       d. other NPs and adverbials typically appear in possessor form
          —the inner possessor (adjacent to VblN) has normal alienable
              possessor form
          —an outer possessor (not adjacent to VblN), even an independent
              pronoun, has a following Possessive ma$    Overall, the structure of a Verbal Noun phrase, especially the treatment of
preceding constituents, is similar to that of ‘before …’ clauses, which have a
nominalized verb that I call pseudo-causative (§9.3, §15.2.4.2). The main
syntactic difference is that Verbal Nouns are more prone to object-compounding
than are pseudo-causative nominals.
    The word-level morphology of Verbal Nouns is described in §4.2.2.
    Examples showing how a chained verb immediately preceding the VblN
appears as an L-toned compound initial are (1043.a-b). (1043.c) shows that a
chained verb retains its normal form when something else (here an object noun
as compound initial) intervenes.(1043) a. [ki $-ka@˘           ma$         pi $li $we$-yE$r-u@]

                            17.4 Verbal Noun (and other nominal) complements 613
    In the absence of an overt subject in possessor form, a non-generic object
NP may appear as a possessor of the VblN, unless separated from the nominal
by an intervening element such as a dative pronominal. Possessor status is
standard when the object is pronominal, or an NP that does not lend itself to
being a compound initial (e.g. a plural noun, a multi-word NP, or a personal
name). The possessive structure is seen clearly in (1044.a), where ma@ is unam-
biguously a 1Sg possessor pronominal (contrast 1Sg independent pronoun or
object mi@ and 1Sg preverbal subject mi $). (1044.b) has Nonh ko@ in the same
construction. (1044.c) has a plural NP (‘women’) as logical object, expressed as
a possessor with Possessive ma$.(1044) a. ma@       cE$r-u@

           woman-Pl Poss             hit-VblN
           ‘hitting women’    If the object NP consists of a simple noun stem with no following modifier,
especially with generic reference, or if it is an unmodified cognate nominal, it
quite often takes compound-initial form, which requires stem-wide tone-
dropping (to all-L tone). (1045.a) is based on bi@rE@ bi $rE@- ‘work a work’ (i.e. ‘do
work’). a sequence of cognate nominal and inflectable verb. In (1045.a), the
cognate nominal appears as an L-toned compound initial bi $rE$-. With ‘cooking
meat’ and the like, where the object is a “real” noun, we can get either a
compound (1045.b) or a possessive construction (1045.c). (1045.d) is another
example of the compound structure.(1045) a. bi r$ E$-bi $r-u@

           ‘sheep-slaughtering’    A possessor does not necessarily prevent the noun from appearing as
L-toned compound initial, as long as the noun’s referent is generic (1046). One
could argue that the (surface) morphosyntax in such examples is of the type
‘hole-digging of ditches’ and ‘debris-sweeping of date palms’, though in main
clauses ‘ditches’ and ‘date palms’ would be possessors of ‘hole’ and ‘debris’,
respectively.(1046) [pç$<se@     ma$]         u$r<o$-ja$-y@<,          …,

       …’ (u$r<o@, ja&˘<, bç$rç$-ka@˘. French fossé) 2004.5.3     As shown below, when both the subject (as possessor) and the object are
overtly expressed in a Verbal Noun clause, an unusually wide variety of object
NPs are forced into compound initial status.
     The subject of the lower verb is often coindexed with the main-clause
subject, and in this case it is not repeated in the lower clause. However, a
subject may appear in a Verbal Noun clause in certain contexts. With
intransitives (i.e. in the absence of a co-occurring object NP), the subject is
expressed as a possessor (1047).(1047) a. n)E&-m     ma$     a$na$-ye@y

           ‘my sleeping’ (variant as compound: ma@ ji $ni $˘-ni $-y@<)    In transitives with both an object and a subject expressed, the subject
normally appears as an outer possessor, followed by Possessive ma$ (even after
an independent pronominal). The construction is easy to elicit, and occurs
                           17.4 Verbal Noun (and other nominal) complements 615
occasionally in texts, provided that at least one of the two arguments is
pronominal. ‘Cat’ in (1048.a) is followed by Possessive ma$, as are the pronouns
1Pl E@mE@ and 2Sg u@ in (1048.b-c). The 2Sg example (1048.c) demonstrates that
the pronominal preceding ma$ is in independent pronoun (rather than
possessor) form, since 2Sg independent H-toned u@ is distinct both from
alienable possessor a@ and from L-toned inalienable possessor u$. (1048.c) also
shows that the logical object E$n)E@ ‘chicken’ appears in normal main-clause form
with lexical tones (rather than as possessor or L-toned compound initial) when it
is separated from the VblN by an intervening element (here a dative
pronominal).(1048) a. ni -$ ni w

           ‘Your-Sg giving a chicken to her is appropriate.’ 2004.3.19   It is more difficult to elicit examples where both subject and object are
nonpronominal NPs. The recursive-possession construction, of the type
[NP ma$ [NP ma$ VblN]], is what we would expect based on the preceding
examples. It is in fact elicitable (1049), but in practice speakers avoid it.(1049) [a$r<-u@m ma$ n)E-& m      ma$ la$g-u@]     ha@dE@-ba$
       [man-Pl Poss woman-Pl Poss hit-VblN] prevent.Impf-3PlS
       ‘They will prevent men from hitting women.’     Instead, speakers generally express the logical object as an L-toned
compound initial rather than as a possessor, resulting in [NP ma$ noun.L-VblN]
with just one morphologically overt possessor (in normal alienable possessor
form), as in (1050.a-c). Some of the normal restrictions on nominal compound
initials (generic reference, no separate pluralization, no separate possessor) are
616   Complement and purposive clauses
relaxed to allow generous use of the compound construction. Thus (1050.a) is
preferred to (1049), above, although it allows the compound initial to keep its
Plural suffix -m. Likewise (1050.b), with unmodified ‘millet’ that can be
construed as generic, may be expanded as (1050.c), where ‘my’ is logically the
possessor of the millet, hence ‘(the) eating (of) [my millet]’. This forces a non-
generic reading of ‘millet’, but it still appears in compound-initial form; the
surface morphosyntax is, apparently, ‘my [millet-eating]’, though not in the
sense this would have in English.
     However, my assistant did balk at using the compound construction when
postnominal modifiers (numerals, demonstratives) forced nongeneric readings.
So (1050.d) was unproblematic (the modifying adjective permits a generic
reading), but (1050.e) reverts to the full construction where the object (as well
as the subject) appears as a possessor.(1050) a. [a$r<-u@m ma$] [n)E-$ m]-la$g-u@          ha@dE@-ba$

     In subject-object-VblN sequences, expressing the object as a compound
initial seems to be regular even when it is a toponym or a personal name, as in
(1051). Such flagrantly non-generic nouns are elsewhere disallowed as initials
in noun-noun or noun-agentive compounds. This is further evidence of the
lengths to which speakers will go to avoid the recursive-possessor construction
in Verbal Noun clauses.(1051) a. [ma@     ba$ma$ko$-ye@y]

           ‘Amadou’s marrying Fatouma’     The strategy of expressing the object as L-toned compound initial,
regardless of generic or specific reference, makes this construction resemble
syntactic tone-dropping in relative-clause subjects, rather than ordinary com-
pounding. Verbal Noun clauses contrast with the other productive nominalized
clause, the ‘before …’ clause with pseudo-causative nominal, which seems to
have no problem with recursive possessors.
     A PP or other adverbial may appear in a Verbal Noun clause with
following Possessive ma$. (1052) is from a text describing the many activities of
members of the blacksmith caste. We get a sequence [[X ma$] [[[Y le$] ma$]
VblN]], where X is a cognate object and Y is dative or allative with postposition
le$.(1052) [ya$˘ji@˘    ma$     o$ju$-ka@˘ ma$     i $jE@]

     When the subjects of the two clauses are not coindexed, as in (1054.b-d), it
is also possible to have a complement clause with an imperfective verb, rather
than a Verbal Noun. See (1142-3) in §18.4.4, below.","[633, 634, 635, 636, 637, 638, 639, 640, 641]"

5.1.15 Instrumental relative compounds (‘oil for rubbing’)The phrasal compounds in this section have the form of relative clauses (of
variable degree of frozenness) with impersonal 3Pl subject, an L-toned head
noun, and an unsuffixed Imperfective participle with Nonhuman Participial -Ø
suffix. The L-toned head noun often represents an instrument associated with
the activity, but there is no overt case-marking specifying instrumental or other
function. I will refer to it as the ‘oil for rubbing’ construction. An example is
(294).(294)    [[gu$ju$   be$          i $n)e˘^ -Ø]

passages where the 3Pl is mis-matched to e.g. a 3Sg (295.a) or 2Sg (295.b)
protagonist who would be the logical user of the item.(295)   a. [E@mE@ a$-n       ga&-n] sa$ri^˘      jE$˘rE@ ga@˘ ka^n,

by verbs are carried out using the instrument (baskets). In (296.b), only the
second verb ‘put’ involves the instrument (baskets again), though admittedly
‘cut’ and ‘put’ refer to actions that are closely integrated. In other cases, a single
verbal idea is expressed by a two-verb sequence, as with the borrowed French
stem utiliser ‘use’ (not directly inflectable) plus inflectable ‘do’ in (296.c).
(296.c) also shows that a PP may be included in the ‘oil for rubbing’
construction.(296)   a. cE$˘     ba$ra@ ja&˘    be$     to@No^˘-Ø             ku$<

216     Nominal and adjectival compounds
     In the constructions given above, the imperfective verb has only one
argument, represented by the L-toned noun. However, the verb may have two
arguments, often a direct object (=patient) and an instrument, the latter being
the head. In this case, the direct object immediately precedes be$, and takes its
regular tones (i.e. it does not undergo tone-dropping). The instrumental head
noun N1 can be incorporated in either of two ways. First, it can be added in the
form [ma$ N1] after the remainder of the construction. This (uncommon)
construction is structurally equivalent to a “headless” relative clause followed
by [ma$ N1] containing the only occurrence of the head noun, a pattern attested,
but not very common, in other relative clauses; see (802) in (§14.1.1). The
second construction, considerably more common, is to prepose the instrumental
noun in L-toned form to the remainder of the construction, which can be
thought of as a postnominal modifier (i.e., an expanded adjective). This is
essentially just an expansion of the type illustrated above, with the extra direct
object noun following the L-toned head.
     Both the instrumental [ma$ N1] add-on option, and the preposed L-toned
instrumental option, are exemplified in (297). This is from a longer passage
listing several earthenware (pottery) products made by women of the blacksmith
caste. The instrumental nouns are bolded in the interlinears.(297)    [[ni@˘ be$        i $ne^˘-Ø]           ma$ wE$˘rE@] be@ ma&˘ $,

pE@˘rE$ ‘small bowl’ in the preceding example, is by far the more common.

           2004.3.8    The [ma$ N1] extension is (rarely) also used when there is only one NP
complement. In (299), the extension may have been favored by the presence of
the universal quantifier cE^w, which is preferentially adjacent to the noun that it
has direct scope over.(299)   [ni $˘     [ka@˘   le$] be$      nç&˘ $-Ø]        ma$ ni@˘   cE^w

describing various items that must be offered to the bride at the time she is
ceremonially transferred (in a large and boisterous parade) from her own home
to her husband’s. The final ‘oil for rubbing’ is straightforward, but it is preceded
by a much more complex instance of the construction.(300)   [wo@      ku^˘<]          [yi $ru$      pi r$ u$] be$    go$ro@ me$y<

        ‘You-Pl will take a garment for covering her on her head with a white
        garment and (=while) conveying her (to her husband’s home) as a
        newlywed, (and) you-Pl will take oil for rubbing.’ 2004.3.20    Instead of a simple sequence based on [noun.L object they.L VERB.Impf]
(‘a garment for covering her’), the phrase headed by ‘(white) garment’ is
elaborated by chaining the VP ending in ‘cover’ with a second VP denoting the
218     Nominal and adjectival compounds
transfer of the bride. The 3Sg pronominal denoting the bride, who is the logical
object of ‘cover’ as well as of ‘take (=convey)’, is expressed only in the ‘take’
VP. This gives us a schematic pattern (301) for the relevant part of (300).(301)    [[on her head] [garment.L white.L] they.L cover and]
             [as-newlywed her they.L transfer.Impf]     The two cases of L-toned preverbal 3Pl subject be$ in this part of the
construction are arguably of different natures referentially. The first, following
‘white garment’, is the impersonal and invariant 3Pl mentioned above, while the
second is perhaps a regular 3Pl pronoun referring to the people accompanying
the bride in the parade.
     (301) is then complicated further by adding a [ma$ NP] phrase, with
Possessive ma$ plus a repeat of the NP functioning as head of the relative (here,
‘white garment’, simplified to ‘garment’). Such head repetition is common in
relative clauses, but all my other examples of the [ma$ NP] add-on involve just
an unmodified noun following ma$ (§14.1.1). The expected form of the add-on
in (300) would therefore have been just ma$ yi $ru@ with the noun ‘garment’.
However, the speaker elaborated this by including repetitions of 3Pl subject be$,
the verb go$ro@- ‘cover’ (now in unsuffixed Imperfective rather than chained
bare-stem form), and Definite ku$<. The final structure as seen in (300) is
therefore (302), where the two occurrences of the head are bolded.(302)    [[[on her head] [garment.L white.L] they.L cover and]
             [as-newlywed her they.L transfer.Impf]]
         of [garment.L they.L cover-Impf]     Though productive and expandible, as the last example shows, the
construction lends itself to lexicalization, since it often denotes a common
implement or container. In some cases, it seems best to write the combination as
a single hyphenated word. For example, (303.a) could be parsed literally as
‘heart for fighting a fight (with)’, but has a lexicalized sense denoting a
personality trait. ‘Slingshot’ (303.b) contains 3Pl subject be$ and unmarked
Imperfective ta^˘<- ‘shoot’; the initial is ma@na$, whose basic sense is ‘plastic’,
most often referring to the lightweight shopping bags found in markets, though
it can also mean ‘slingshot’.(303)    a. cE$nE$-jE@y-be$-jE$yE^˘-Ø

     E$˘-mi@-te@˘re@ ‘time when millet begins to develop ears’ is from E@- ‘see’, 1Sg
mi@, and te@˘re@- ‘show’. The “syntax” here is somewhat opaque, but it can be
taken to have a literal meaning ‘see (it) and show (it) to me’. It reflects the
curiosity among Jamsay farmers as to the timing of the first appearance of
millet ears (seed spikes) during the growing season. Of course the ears appear
first in a few plants within a field, and in one field before another field, so there
is much interest in the first reports of ear development.","[236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241]"

6.3.3.2    Adjectival intensifiersLike other languages of the zone (e.g. Fulfulde, montane Songhay languages),
Jamsay has a number of intensifiers that are used chiefly with adjectives,
especially in predicative function. They do not occur in my recorded texts, but
do occur in more lively conversation.
    Most Jamsay intensifiers are frozen full-stem reduplications based on
CvC or CvCv “stems” that do not occur elsewhere. Nearly all are H-toned
throughout. An example is ku@ju@-ku@ju@, which is paired with jE@m ‘black’.
    There are two constructions. In one, the semantically primary adjective
immediately precedes the intensifier and takes L-tones, i.e., it is tone-dropped
(351.a). The ‘be’ quasi-verb, if present, follows the intensifier. Here the
adjective and intensifier behave like any two modifying adjectives in sequence.
In the other construction, the ordering is the same but there is no tonal
interaction, and the ‘be’ quasi-verb is added directly to the primary adjective
(351.b). Here the intensifier patterns as a loosely attached adverbial.(351)     a. jE$m          ku@ju@-ku@ju@kç$

             blackit.is black.Intens
             [= (a)]    An intensifier may also be included with an modifying adjective within an
NP. In this case the first construction illustrated above, with L-toned primary
adjective, is used (352).(352)     [i $ju$ jE$m      ku@ju@-ku@ju@ lE&y]          E@˘-sa$-m

          ‘I saw two jet black dogs.’     For the adjectives in (353), a choice between different intensifiers correlates
with distinct senses. In (353.b), the intensifier cE@tE$rE$-cE$tE$rE$ differs from most
other reduplicative intensifiers in its tonal pattern. It seems to have some
relationship with the adjective cE$tE@ applied to unusually short animal breeds.
Still in (353.b), intensifier da@N-da@N will reappear in (354), below, with e@˘N
‘nearby’.(353)         gloss                      regular adjective    intensifier          a. ‘hot’                       ç@gu$                ja@w-ja@w

reduplication. In (355.c), the intensifier has interjection-like CvC form, though
in one case it can be reduplicated. ka@k is used in contexts like ‘he stopped still’
or ‘she stopped in her tracks’, emphasizing abrupt and total cessation of
movement.(355)       gloss                 regular stem     intensifier        a. ‘heavy’                du$ju@           cE@r<E@-nE@nE@nE@

     For the cases in (356), the elicited construction involved a verb (either a

function as (nonverbal) predicate.(357)     a. do$g-a^˘-Ø                  pe@y-pe@y

15.1.16 Chaining with linker ti@A morpheme ti@ (probably related historically to Perfective suffix -ti -$ ) may be
inserted between chained verbs. Occasionally, it functions as the final verb in a
chain (in which case it takes suffixal inflections). I gloss it in interlinears as
“Link.”
     In (907.a-e), ti@ links two verbs, and has no inflection of its own. As I
interpret the examples, the two relevant events are ordered chonologically. I
take this to be characteristic of ti@, which makes sense if it is related to the
Perfective verbal suffix. Three of the examples, namely (907.a-c), involve verb
da$ƒa@- ‘leave, abandon’ before ti@, though (907.a) and (907.b) are from the same
textual passage.(907)   a. du$N-ya$ra@    tE@mE@    me$y<,

"     Importantly, this insures that tone-dropping, by which the entire stem
shifts to L-tone, always has an audible effect. Tone-dropping is widely used in
Jamsay morphosyntax: with nouns (as relative-clause heads, or before
adjectives); with adjectives (before other adjectives); with pronominals (as
preverbal subjects in relative and other subordinated clauses, as inalienable
possessors, and before some discourse markers); and with verbs (e.g. before
Negative suffixes or when AN categories are defocalized). Tone-Dropping also
plays an important role in relative clauses.
     Below, I will suggest a reformulation of constraint (99), in the context of an
autosegmental interpretation of Jamsay tones, to the effect that the basic lexical
form of each stem has exactly one H tone-component. This in turn will raise
the possibility that some Jamsay stems are all-L lexically, but are supplied by a
default H-tone in order to satisfy the exactly-one-H-tone constraint (§3.7.1.5).
                                                                            3.7 Tones     833.7.1.2    Lexical tone patterns for verbsFor verb stems, at the level of the basic lexical form there are only two possible
tonal patterns for any given CV-structure: a) all H-tones, b) all L-tones except
for a single H-tone on the final mora, i.e., L(L...)H. We will see below that the
initial consonant has interesting correlations tonal contour, a specific feature of
verbs. A few examples for each syllable count will now be given.
      Regular monosyllabic verbs have the shape (C)v˘- and may be R- or
H-toned. R: ya&˘- ‘go’, wç&˘- ‘kill’. H: ga@˘- ‘say’, go@˘- ‘go out’, and ti@˘- ‘send’. A
rare minimal pair is na@˘- ‘spend night’ versus na&˘- ‘make (rope)’.
      Bisyllabic verbs may be HH or LH. HH: pE@rE@- ‘strike (match)’, ka@˘ra@- ‘rip’,
ka@wga@- ‘separate’. LH: go$jo@- ‘treat differently’, go$ro@- ‘cover with blanket’,
jE$˘rE@- ‘bring’, dç$mnç@- ‘console’. A rare minimal pair is u$go@- ‘bake in oven’
versus u@go@- ‘extinguish’.
      Trisyllabic verbs (derived or underived) may be HHH or LLH. HHH:
e@me@-w<e@- ‘make spacious’, E@NE@r<E@- ‘restrain’, ka@Na@r<a@- ‘shine’. LLH di g  $ i $-rE@-
‘align’, dç$rç$gç@- ‘ransom’, ga$ma$r<a@- ‘divide’.
      Quadrisyllabic verbs are rare, being limited to infrequently occurring
causatives of trisyllabic verbs, e.g. HHHH ka@Na@r<a@-w<a@- ‘cause to shine’,
LLLH gç$lç$rç$-wç@- ‘cause to snore’. I know of no five-syllabled inflectable verb
stems, though the quadrisyllabic verbs just mentioned may occur in the pseudo-
causative nominal form (in ‘before …’ clauses) with a further suffix -wv$.
      Tabulations based on a working lexicon containing some 720 mono-
morphemic regular verbs are given in (100). Since the length of the final vowel
depends on syllable count (monosyllables have a long vowel, others end in a
short vowel), and since there are no final syllables ending in a consonant, only
syllable count and tone are considered.(100)         tone pattern       #        % of syllable-count type          a. monosyllabic (C)v˘-

increasing number of bi- and trisyllabic Fulfulde verbs borrowed into Jamsay.
These verbs, often ending in E and often showing medial consonant clusters,
have all-H tone in their basic forms: ju@kkE@- ‘fine’, ja@Ngi@nE@- ‘teach’ (with
Fulfulde Causative -in-), and many others.
     There are important interactions between tone and (preceding) consonant
quality (for verbs but not other stems). For the monosyllabic verbs of shape
(C)v˘, I found that H-tone correlated very strongly with absence of initial
consonant (5/5), with C = voiceless stop including c (24/25), and with C =
voiceless fricative including h and sibilants (9/9). The one case of R-tone after
voiceless stop was a defective verb po&˘- used (as a verb) in greetings. R-tone
correlated with C = semivowel (5/6), the exception being we@˘- ‘flip over’. H and
R tones were evenly distributed with C = nasal (5 H, 3 R), and with C = voiced
stop including j (15 H, 11 R). A correlation of H-tone with C = l, the only liquid
that occurs in word-initial position, is suggestive (4/4).
     For nonmonosyllabic verbs, the choice is between all-H and {LH}, the
latter requiring an initial-syllable L-tone. As one might expect, even leaving out
suffixal derivatives of monosyllabic stems, the C of the first syllable is the key
to consonant-tone correlations. I checked the (C)v(˘˘ )Cv- stems, excluding
suffixal derivatives from monosyllabic stems. All-H tone contour is
categorically predictable when C1 is a voiceless stop {p t c k}; I found some
130 all-H stems versus zero LH. Likewise, all 50 Cv(˘)Cv- stems beginning
with voiceless fricative {s f} have all-H contour. Initial l is another strong
predictor of all-H contour, with 18 all-H versus one LH (lE$gE@- ‘tease’). On the
other hand, when C1 is a voiced stop {b d j g} I recorded 130 LH stems versus
only 9 all-H stems, and the latter are probably all Fulfulde borrowings, e.g.
ga@˘jE@- ‘converse’ (note the noncanonical a...E vocalism). Likewise, when C1 is a
semivowel {w y} I found 32 cases of LH, and the 8 instances of all-H are
probably all borrowings, except perhaps for wE@rE@- ‘be wild’. A nasal C1 favors
LH but only statistically, with 36 LH stems versus 14 all-H; of the latter, 3 are
probable Fulfulde loans. All Cv(˘)Cv- beginning with h (11) and r (1) are all-H,
but these are all from Fulfulde. For vCv- with no initial consonant, I count 7 LH
contours versus 33 HH. In the absence of an initial C, one might suspect that the
intervocalic medial C would play a role, but I can see no correlation of this C
with tone. Overall, then, there is a striking correlation between initial C and
stem tone. If Fulfulde borrowings are factored out, there is a very strong
                                                                       3.7 Tones    85correlation of all-H with initial voiceless stop, voiceless fricative, or l. There is
likewise a strong correlation of LH with initial voiced stop or semivowel.
     The role of voiced consonants, and particularly of voiced stops, as
depressor consonants has been widely discussed, though there are running
arguments about whether depressor C’s have a phonological L-tone feature
associated with them, or whether there is a perhaps very brief local register
transition from depressor to following vowel. In the case of Jamsay, the point I
would make is that the difference between H- and R-toned monosyllabics is
clearly phonological (and tonal). For example, when a (rising) LH-toned bisyl-
labic verb has a derivational suffix, the derivation has LLH tone contour
regardless of C2. Therefore the stem-initial L-tone component, though cor-
related with (say) an initial voiced stop, spreads into the second syllable in a
manner inconsistent with a local phonetic effect in the first consonant-vowel
transition.
     The correlations described in this section between stem-tone contour and
initial consonant relate only to the basic lexical form of the verb stem. All verbs
are subject to overlaid tonal contours in the unsuffixed Perfective (all-L, except
{HL} in relative clauses) and in participial compounds. In such cases, the initial
consonant of the stem, and the lexical tone, are disregarded.","[104, 105, 106, 107]"

‘going and coming’ is illustrated in (411); it is based on the unsuffixed verb
stems with a tonal change. After factoring out the pitch fall due to dying-quail
intonation, it is impossible to determine whether the first conjunct’s tone is H or
F (ya@˘ or ya^˘).(411)     [ya@       yE@rE$]   ka@r<a@kç$

4.7.2.2    Other ordinals (suffix -nE@)For numerals above ‘1’, ordinals are expressed by adding a suffix -nE@. The
preceding numeral (including composite numerals like ‘eleven’) drops to L-tone
within a level, but if there is a mix of levels (with elements from two or more of
the sets ‘1-99’, hundreds, thousands, and/or millions), tone-dropping does not
cross the phrasal boundary separating two levels. Thus tone-dropping affects the
simple numerals in (247.a-b,d), and the tripartite but single-level numeral in
(247.c), but it affects only the final part of the complex numeral in (247.e),
where ‘hundred’ retains its normal tone.
    For ta&˘n ‘three’, the ordinal is the slightly irregular ta$y-nE@.(247)         form                           gloss          a. single-digit numeral

4.7.3    Fractions and portionsThere are no terms denoting precise numerical fractions of the type ‘half’,
‘(one) third)’, and the like. The relevant sense is communicated pragmatically
by expressions based on a noun such as go@jo$ ‘part, division’ (of an object) or
ku$ru@ ‘(somebody’s) portion, share’, or the adjective ga$ma@ ‘certain (one(s)s, of
a group), some (of a mass)’ (special human Pl ga$ma$ na@m).(248)    a. [ma&Ngo$lo$ ma$ go@jo$]y$        mi&-n       o$˘-Ø

5 Nominal and adjectival compounds
5.1     Nominal compoundsThe combinations noun plus adjective, and noun plus demonstrative (nu@No$),
require tone-dropping on the noun (§6.1.4). This is suggestive of compounding,
since the initials in some noun-noun compound types also drop their tones. In
this section, I discuss phenomena that are more obviously compounds in nature.
     A number of formulae for tone patterns are distinguished in the sections
below, using “x” for a compound initial of variable word-class, “a” for
adjective, “n” for noun, “v” for verb, and Ppl (as usual) for Participial suffix. A
macron (e.g. in “x#”) means that the constituent in question retains the same
tones that it has in isolation. A grave accent (“x$”) means that all tones in the
relevant constituent are dropped to low. An acute accent (“x@”) means that all
tones are raised to high, and a circumflex (“x^”) denotes an overlaid H(H…    … )L
stem-wide tone pattern.","[211, 212, 213]"

    Another idiomatic construction is with bE$rE@- ‘get, obtain’. There is no
Reflexive Possessor here (‘his own head’ with E$nE@ ma$) since ‘his head’ is
topicalized (presentential), and “resumed” by a clause-internal Nonhuman
pronominal.(1116) [wo@        ku@˘<]   ko$-ru@    bE$rE@ me$y< ga$ra$-Ø

       ‘His head (=himself) [topic], he got (=saved) it and got through (the
       elephant attack)’. 2004.3.4
18.2 Logophoric and indexing pronouns18.2.1 True logophoric function (E$nE@, E$nE@ be@)For a discussion of logophorics and reflexives in the central Dogon languages
Donno-So, Toro-So, and Togo-kan, see Culy, Kodio, and Togo (1994). Of
interest is the fact that the Logophoric in Togo-kan is given as “EnE (be).”
     The basic Jamsay third person Logophoric anaphor is E$nE@ (Sg) or E$nE@ be@
(Pl). We have just seen that the same forms may function as reflexives. The
logophoric is used most systematically when the antecedent is the sentient being
(usually human but sometimes animal) whose speech, thoughts, or intentions
are reported by the speaker. In this function, logophorics function a) to clarify
reference (by coindexation to a stable antecedent), b) to define the relevant
stretch of discourse as a quotation (often in conjunction with explicit quotative
markers), and c) to dissociate the present speaker from responsibility for the
veracity of the assertions made (‘allegedly’). Logophorics may be thought of as
embedded 1Sg and 1Pl pronouns within quotations attributed to a third-party
speaker.
     Logophorics do not behave like other pronominals in terms of tonal patterns
or ordering, suggesting that E$nE@ is a noun. Subject category is expressed, for
other pronominal categories, by either suffixes on the verb (in main clauses) or
by special L-toned proclitics immediately adjacent to the verb (in relatives and
some other subordinated clauses). Logophoric subject is expressed by E$nE@ (or
its plural E$nE@ be@), always before the verb but not necessarily adjacent to it, and
with no L-toned form #E$nE$ (1117.a-b,d-e). Logophoric subjects are NP-like in
that they require regular third person subject pronominal agreement on the verb.
While 3Sg subject suffix -Ø is inaudible, Logophoric plural E$nE@ be@ takes an
audible 3Pl subject suffix -ba$ (1117.d-e). Logophoric object is expressed by the
same forms (1117.c).

Note that the unsuffixed Imperfective verb is followed by Nonhuman kç$,
agreeing with the logophoric subject.","[669, 670, 671]"

3.2.2     Embryonic metrical structureMany languages have stress or accent systems, which generally have at least a
partially undulating, rhythmical nature (alternating stress rules, clash avoidance,
etc.). Jamsay is a tone language, whose tones are important both lexically and
grammatically. Unlike the case in other (non-Dogon) tone languages of the area,
in Jamsay there is no “tone sandhi” across word boundaries. In native
vocabulary, long words may consist entirely of metrically light, monomoraic Cv
syllables. For these reasons, there is no phonetically obvious metrical structure
of the sort we observe in English.
     However, an embryonic metrical structure is manifested in various
phonological rules, particularly those applying to verb stems and their suffixal
derivatives (including Verbal Nouns). The core sequence involved is a stem-
initial bisyllabic [] foot behaving metrically as a trochee [sw], i.e., with a
metrically strong 1 followed by a weak 2. Squared brackets demarcate
metrical feet. Depending on the phonological process in question, there may be
further stipulations on one or both of these syllables (e.g. as to vowel length), or
a following third syllable may be required. There is no clear evidence for
metrical structure in the third, fourth, and fifth syllables of long, uncompounded
stems or words.
     The phonological processes that are at least arguably sensitive to the initial
[sw] asymmetry are those in (28). For each, I give a brief summary (often
oversimplified) of the content of the process, name the morphological
categories affected, and a schematic representation of the relevant structure
                          3.2 Internal phonological structure of stems and words   27(with the targeted segment underlined). In the schemas,  is used for a syllable
that can be of any shape, i.e. initial (C)v(˘)C and noninitial Cv(˘)C, while more
specific representations like (C)v (optional C plus short vowel) are used when
the process requires.(28)    a. g-Spirantization (§3.3.2)

            relevant structure: [Cv]-[C-u@] or the rare [][CvC-u@]        f. Presuffixal V2-Raising (§3.5.2.2)
             process: mid-height V2 {e E) or (o ç} raised to i or u
             domain: suffixally derived verbs (e.g. causative)
             relevant structure: [Cv]-[Cv-     (28.a) is a consonantal lenition that occurs at the onset of 2 (but not e.g.
3). (28.b-e) are vocalic deletions and other lenitions. (28.b,d) are strictly
limited to 2, (28.c) is very strongly associated with 2 though it applies rarely
(in elicitation only) to later syllables; and (28.e) can apply equally to 2 or a
later syllable but there are very few opportunities for it to apply to a later
syllable. (28.f) is not obviously a lenition process, but since raising is associated
28      Phonology
with lenition in (28.e) one could make a case that (28.f) too is a lenition of sorts;
it applies only to 2.
     The relevant structures in (28.a-f) are sufficiently divergent to show that no
fixed “underlying” metrical structure can account for all the data. 2 is always
centrally involved, but the lenitions are in some cases extended to immediately
following syllables. Only (28.a,d) affect stems of all word classes, while
(28.b-c, e-f) apply only to verb stems (including Verbal Nouns derived from
them).
     If the metrical structure were better developed, one would expect some kind
of undulating stress, so that e.g. a five-syllable word would have an audible
organization into metrical feet, e.g. [sw][sw] (with extra-metrical final
syllable). This is not the case.
     A probably related tone-lowering occurs in the second verb stem in certain
types of chains, including iterations (repetitions) of the same stem. This tone-
lowering applies at the level of words (or stems), not syllables. See §15.1.1 and
§16.6.2.","[48, 49, 50]"

5.1.9    Agentive compounds of type (x$ v@-Ppl)In this type of compound, there is a bare noun with overlaid stem-wide L-tone,
followed by a verb in participial form (Sg -n, Pl -m) but with stem-wide
H-tone. The formula is therefore [x$ v@-Ppl]. Segmentally, such agentives may be
indistinguishable from productive subject relatives with overt object (agentive
“Deerslayer” versus relative “one who slays deer”), but the tones are a failsafe
distinguishing factor, since in ordinary subject relatives the object NP has at
least one H-tone and the participle cannot be all-H tone.
     Examples of agentives with non-cognate incorporated object (or similar
complement) are in (270). I transcribe them (unlike subject relatives) as single
words. The components are listed in parentheses with their lexical tones after
the free translation. This agentive type is usual in connection with occupations
or other regular activities that define human roles.(270)    a. ta$ra$-ya@˘-m

5.1.10 Compounds with -i^˘< ‘child of’The human noun ‘child’ (Sg i^-n, Pl u@r<-u$m) corresponds to nonhuman i^˘<,
which can mean ‘child’ (of an adult animal) or just ‘juvenile (animal)’, ‘fruit’ or
‘seed’ (of plant), a small object paired with a larger object, a part of a two-part
or other complex object, or a diminutive version of a normally larger object.
There is ample room for semantic specialization for specific lexical items.
    The initial always undergoes tone-dropping. When the initial ends in a
short vowel, VV-Contraction (90) may occur (275.a), but more often does not
(275.b). No contraction occurs after a long vowel (275.c). Of course there is no
phonological change when the initial ends in a consonant (275.d).(275)    a. final short vowel of the initial is elided before -i^˘<              i $j-i^˘<

in e.g. Songhay).
206     Nominal and adjectival compounds
    sa$˘j-i^˘< ‘bird’ is related to the much less common synonym sa$ju@. Likewise,
mE@n ‘bracelet’ has a diminutive mE$˘n-i^˘<. Both mE$˘n-i^˘< and sa$˘j-i^˘< show
irregular lengthening of the first vowel.
    A special case semantically is ba$˘-i^˘< ‘enemy, rival’, literally ‘father-child’
(perhaps in the sense ‘father’s child’, i.e. brother or parallel cousin). Similar
compounds occur in some Songhay languages and the pattern is probably
regional.","[223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228]"

3.7.3     Tonal morphophonology3.7.3.1    Autosegmental tone association (verbs)The suffixal derivations (e.g. reversive, causative) involve addition of a final
-Cv@- suffix, adding one monomoraic syllable to the stem (§9.1-4). A handful of
lexical idiosyncracies in tone relationships are observed, but the productive
tonal relationships of input to suffixal derivative are those in (120). The hyphen
in the right-hand column corresponds to the stem-suffix boundary in the
derivative.(120)        input        derivative          a. H            H-H
             HH           HH-H

             LH           LL-H
             LLH          LLL-H    In other words, if the input stem is all-H, so is the derivative. If the input
stem has only a final-mora H, so does the derivative (entailing an apparent
“jump” of this H-tone from the final syllable of the underived stem to the
suffixal syllable). An example of the latter: bu$ro@- ‘be revived’, causative
bu$ru$-go@- ‘resuscitate (someone)’.
                                                                  3.7 Tones    109     This problem can be easily resolved within either the default-final-mora-H
analysis (mentioned but not endorsed in §3.7.1.5, above), or the autosegmental
model that I prefer. In the former, the verbs in (120.b) are underlyingly L-toned.
Both the simple stem and the derivative undergo a late rule creating an H-tone
for the final mora, in order to satisfy the constraint (99) against all-L stems.
     In the autosegmental model, the difference between (120.a) and (120.b) is
that the autosegmental level has (lexically specified) {H} in the first case and
bitonal {LH} in the second. In the latter, it is then necessary to specify that the
H is associated with the final mora of a verb stem, as already stipulated in
(113.c) in §3.7.1.7, above. The interesting point is that this association is post-
derivational; that is, it applies to suffixally derived stems in the same way as to
underived stems. There is no evidence for cyclical application. The derivations
of bu$ro@- ‘be revived’ and its causative are in (121), omitting detail about
vocalism that is not relevant here.(121)        ‘be revived’      ‘resuscitate’          comment          a. buro-, {LH}       buro-, Caus, {LH}      lexical input

          c. bu$ro@-           bu$ru$-go@-            tonal association
3.7.3.2    Phonology of H(H…)L and H(L…)L tone overlaysThere are two {HL} tone overlays: a) the widespread H(H…)L and b) the more
restricted pattern H(L…)L that occurs in the first stem in one type of verb-stem
iteration. The two overlays are audibly distinct only with verbs of three or more
syllables. Take, for example, ga$ma$r<a@- ‘divide, share’. The H(H…)L overlay is
realized as HHL in the unsuffixed Perfective ga@ma@r<a$- in relative clause
participles. In the relevant iteration pattern, H(L…)L appears in the first part of
(and indeed the whole of) ga@ma$r<a$-ga$ma$r<a$.
     The existence of two distinct {HL} overlays is obviously a problem for an
autosegmental approach to Jamsay tones, and perhaps to any other “phono-
logical” approach. However, there is a clear asymmetry. H(H…)L occurs
widely in Jamsay, turning up in multiple grammatical contexts involving all
lexical word classes.
     The H(L…)L pattern occurs in one verb-stem iteration pattern that may
involve up to three L-toned stem iterations following the initial H(L…)L
occurrence (§11.6.3). For example, a trisyllabic verb with two iterations has a
tone pattern HLL-LLL-LLL. The iterations have clearly undergone tone-
dropping, erasing lexical tones, but one can argue that the tone-dropping begins
with the second syllable of the first occurrence, hence H[LL-LLL-LLL]. This,
110     Phonology
plus the initial H-tone (which is not lexical), suffice to characterize the tones of
this iteration construction. This is a unique, global tone pattern overlaid on the
entire sequence of stems, not a stem-specific overlay like that for all of the
H(H…)L overlays. Moreover, this iteration pattern is stylistically marked, being
typical of narrative style, unlike the stylistically neutral constructions that
require H(H…)L overlays.
     Given that H(H…  … )L is clearly the phonologically regular instantiation of
{HL} in tone overlays, the question arises whether the association rules for this
overlay are the same as those for basic stems of autosegmental type {HL} as
described above. The central generalization for tone-component association for
stems, extracted from (113.c) in §3.7.1.7, above, is repeated here as (122).(122)    associate final L (preceded by H) to the final mora     For example, the basic lexical forms of {HL} noun stems with a final bi- or
trimoraic syllable are overwhelmingly …F rather than …L in form. For
example, the (C)vCvC segmental shape has 18 cases of lexically HF-toned
(C)v@Cv^C against zero cases of HL #C)v@Cv$C, see (104) in §3.7.1.3, above. The
asymmetry extends to trisyllabic stems, e.g. of shape (C)vCvCvC, where we get
a total of 8 …F stems including 5 HHF (C)v@Cv@Cv^C against one …L stem,
which happens to be of shape CvCCvCvC (107).
     To see whether the grammatical H(H…)L overlay is consistent with this,
we must review how it applies to mono-, bi-, and trimoraic stems. To do this,
we must piece together an overall picture from facts gleaned from the individual
subtypes.
     For inflected verb stems, the H(H…)L overlay occurs in unsuffixed
Perfective participles (in relative clauses). The input-output relations are
indicated in (123). The overlay is limited to stems, disregarding pronominal-
subject suffixes (which have no intrinsic tones and so will eventually acquire
their surface tone by low-level rules). All inflected verb stems of more than one
syllable end in a Cv@ syllable (not Cv@˘ or Cv@C), so we do not have a full range of
syllabic types. The lexical tones of the inputs are irrelevant to the outputs so
they are not indicated here.

            Cv(C)CvCvCv-                    Cv@(C)Cv@Cv@Cv$-     In the monosyllabic case, no choice of association patterns is available,
since bitonal {HL} must associate its two components to the two available
moras, respectively. In the non-monosyllabic cases, we cannot determine
whether the final L tone-component is associated with the final syllable or with
the final mora, since the two converge in every case (there are no final long
vowels, or final consonants, in nonmonosyllabic verbs). The quadrisyllabic case
shows that the H can extend into the third syllable from the left. Example:
gç$lç$rç$-wç@- ‘cause to snore’, Perfective participle gç@lç@rç@-wç$-, as in do$gu$ro$
gç@lç@rç@ mi@ wo$ gç@lç@rç@-wç$-Ø ‘when he/she made me snore’. Since no known
verb has more than four syllables, it appears that once the L-tone is associated
with the final syllable/mora, the H-tone fills up the remainder without limit.
     (Morphologically) inalienable kin terms have H(H…)L when possessed, in
contrast to other contours, often {LH}, in absolute (unpossessed) function
(§6.2.2). Representative data are in (124).(124)        gloss                   absolute               possessed        a. monosyllabic

112     Phonology
    Again, in the monosyllabic case there are no choices to be made; when
possessed, the {HL} tone pattern can only be expressed using both input moras,
so we get an F-toned monosyllable. In the bisyllabic cases, ‘husband’ with its
monomoraic syllables can only come out as HL when possessed. However,
‘(man’s) sister’ does provide some new information: for a CvCv˘ stem, the H
component spreads into the onset of the second syllable, resulting in a HF
pattern (yE@sa^˘). The trisyllabic cases do not extend the H into the third syllable,
even in ‘sister’s child’ and ‘grandchild’ where the Sg -n suffix would make a
HHF tone pattern phonologically possible. However, if the domain of H(H…)L
is the stem, disregarding the suffix, ‘sister’s child’ and ‘grandchild’ are
(C)vCvCv- stems of the same type as ‘(woman’s) brother’, and there is no
reason to expect a final-syllable contour tone in the possessed form.
    Modifying adjectives following comparative ga@˘ra@ ‘more, most’ (§12.1.3)
have H(H…)L contours. Some examples are in (125).(125)        gloss         regular form     as modifier, after ga@˘ra@         a. monosyllabic
             ‘black’     jE@m               jE^m         b. bisyllabic
              ‘bad’        mç$n)u@          mç@n)u$         c. trisyllabic
              ‘smooth’     o$nu$r<u@        o@nu@r<u$     Again, the H(H…)L tone overlay applies to stems, disregarding suffixes.
Thus gu$ru@ ‘long’ has an H(H…)L form gu@ru$, from which (adding Sg -n) we
get human Sg HL-toned gu@ri $-n (not HF-toned #gu@ri^-n).
     Bahuvrihi compounds (§5.2.1) have H(H…)L finals. The tones of these
finals are consistent with what we have seen so far in this section. A useful
datum is that HH-toned numeral ko@ro@y ‘six’ (note the final heavy syllable)
appears as HF -ko@ro^y in e.g. mi@r<e@-ku@ro^y ‘having six voices’. This is parallel
in tonal pattern to possessed HF-toned yE@s a^˘ ‘sister’ mentioned above.
     This leaves nominal compounds whose finals have H(H…)L tones. The
data are consistent with what we have seen in the preceding types. Examples are
in (126).

syllabic, I elicited a term for (nonexistent) ‘bush (=wild) cassava’, with the
productive initial e$ju@- ‘field’ or ‘bush, outback’, which is used in several ‘wild
X’ terms. ‘Cassava’ is ba$na$ku^˘< (Bambara loan). The elicited compound ‘bush
cassava’ came out as e$ju@-ba@na@ku^˘<. There is a possibility that the word for
‘cassava’ is a crypto-compound (ba$na$-ku^˘<), as indeed it is in the Bambara
source, so we must be circumspect about assessing this datum. However, on the
face of it, e$ju@-ba@na@ku^˘< does suggest that the H in the H(H…)L overlay may
spread into the onset of a bimoraic third syllable. If so, this strongly supports the
view that the H(H…)L overlay has the same set of realizations as autosegmental
{HL} in lexical stems as documented above. I conclude that the H(H…            … )L
overlay reduces to autosegmental {HL}.","[130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135]"
"(23)    [[… [… Nx …]NP … (SP) Verb-Ppl] Poss Nx]    The internal head NP is built around the noun Nx and may also contain a
possessor, modifying adjectives, and a numeral. The noun (with no modifiers)
may then be repeated after the participle, with the Possessive morpheme
separating them. The internal head NP (excluding alienable possessors)
undergoes tone-dropping, while the external copy has its regular lexical tone.
Neither instance of the head noun is pronominalized. Thus ‘a man who comes

3 Phonology
3.1     GeneralThe prosodic structure, involving tone patterns and vocalic lengthening, is
deeply intertwined with the morphosyntax. The segmental phonology has some
intricacies, but there are few disfiguring phonological processes that make it
difficult to identify stems and other morphemes in texts. Exception: Post-
Sonorant Syncope (60) and the consonantal assimilation rules that it feeds can
disguise the identity of (C)vCv- words and stems. An example of this is bE$rE@-
‘get’, Perfective Negative bE$l-li@- (via Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) and Rhotic
Assimilation (77)). In examples in later chapters, I frequently list the full form
of lexical items disguised in this way in parentheses after the free translation.
     There being no voiced bilabial or labiodental fricative v, I use the symbol
“v” for any short vowel, “v˘” for any long vowel, and uppercase “V” as the
unmarked symbol for any vowel (long or short). The symbol for “syllable” is .","[43, 44, 45, 46, 47]"

8.5.2     Extent (‘a lot’, ‘a little’)E$ji@< ‘very, very much’ is an adverb that quantifies predicate adjectives and
some other predicates. Its location is variable, suggesting that it functions as a
clausal adverbial (cf. English indeed or truly). For example, it may follow or
precede an adjectival predicate (479). See also §8.5.4.1, below.(479)     a. wa$lgu@kç$         E$ji@<

interpreted as an abbreviation of a phrase of the ‘five or six’ type, with two
more or less adjacent quantifiers defining a range. Both the abbreviated and full

nominal. Perhaps it is an L-toned preverbal subject pronominal, or an unusual
case of demonstrative ko$ ‘that’ not modifying a following noun.
    pi@li@we@- is a common verb meaning ‘return, go back’. As a nonfinal verb in
a chain, pi@li@we@ may usually be glossed ‘again’. However, it may be stretched
into a distinct adverbial sense close to ‘furthermore’. In (1167), I render it with
the English verb ‘proceed to’, suggesting a sequence of actions.(1167) [ko$     na$˘m-pi r$ <e@     ku$<], pi@li@we@ ko@       ha@˘sE@-ba$,

what happens with R-toned numerals like le&y ‘two’. The R-tone, however, is
audible in (1160.a-b).(1169) a. [i@˘r<e@  le$    sa&y]     ko@         bi $rE^˘-Ø

and right conjuncts, and it may therefore carry the special prosodic lengthening
and F-tone associated with conjunction (1170).(1170) [be@     sa&y],   [be@      n)a˘$ -ba$˘n)a@      sa&y]

       ‘Just them and their eating bowls.’    sa&y is not as common in texts as ‘only’ forms in many other languages,
since it gets stiff competition from an explicitly or implicitly double-negative
construction including y$ la$˘ de$y (§11.2.1.3, §16.4). This means literally ‘if it
is not X’, but can extend to ‘unless it is X’ (i.e., ‘except X’, ‘other than X’), and
with implied by unexpressed double-negative ‘(nothing) unless it is X’, which is
equivalent to ‘only (=exclusively) X’.

have been uttered. A complement such as a direct object may likewise be
omitted during the first one or two VPs, then appear overtly before a noninitial
(perhaps the final) verb of which it is a logical argument. In (877), note that
Nonhuman object pronominal ko@ is repeated (lines 1 and 4).
    In (878), ‘milk’ is the logical object of ‘bring’, ‘put’, and ‘sell’, but it does
not appear until just before the final verb ‘sell’. This contrasts with e.g. (876.a),
above, where the direct object appears in the first eligible VP and is not
repeated.","[545, 546]"
"
3.7.2     Grammatical tone patternsGrammatically controlled modifications of lexical tones are of two kinds: Tone-
Grafting (to the end of the stem), see (116), (118), and (131) below, and stem-
wide tone overlays. Grafting does not erase lexical tones, while overlays do.
There are many overlaid tone contours in Jamsay morphosyntax, while grafting
is limited to the tonal locative of nouns (§8.1) and to the unsuffixed Imper-
fective of verbs (§10.1.2.8).
     Overlays themselves are of two kinds. In one, the overlay on the stem is
automatically triggered by a following suffix. In the other, the overlay is
controlled syntactically, though of course this too represents a kind of
dependence on the presence of other elements.
     The beauty of the lexical tones, with at least one H-tone element in every
regular noun, verb, adjective, and numeral stem (§3.7.1), is that one can always
audibly express a morphosyntactic category by converting all tones in the stem
to L (tone-dropping). This happens systematically with nouns (before a mod-
ifying adjective or demonstrative, as head of relative clause, and as initial in
some compound types), adjectives and numerals (as final word in an NP that
heads a relative clause), pronouns (preverbal subject function, possessor with
inalienable kin terms, preceding some particles like Topic ke@), and verbs
(before Negative suffix, unsuffixed Perfective after focalized constituent).
     There are other tone overlays, the most common being H(H…)L, which
occurs in the unsuffixed Perfective of verbs when used in relative clauses, in the
final of some nominal compounds, and in possessed forms of inalienable nouns.
There is an all-H overlay in imperatives of most CvCv- and Cv˘- verbs, and in
the final of some compounds.
     It is no exaggeration to say that grammatical tone changes (along with
grammaticalized intonation) are the central motor of Jamsay morphosyntax.
     Below is a brief summary of the grammatical tone processes applicable to
verbs, nouns, and other word-classes. It is followed by formulations of the
relevant grammatical tone processes. The section on tonology will conclude
with discussion of a number of low-level tone rules.",[125]
"
3.7.4.3    Final-Tone ResyllabificationAs we have seen, an R- or F-tone in a stem-final CvC or Cv˘C syllable is
articulated with the final L-tone component associated with the final C. There
are a few cases, however, where a vowel-initial clitic or suffix is added. This
forces resyllabification, whereby the stem-final sonorant becomes the onset of
the syllable containin the clitic or suffix. For example, R-toned [Cv&C] is a
normal bimoraic syllable in isolation, but adding a suffix -vC forces
resyllabification to [Cv&][C-vC]. This is problematic since the first syllable is
now monomoraic but carries a two-part contour tone.
     The relevant morphological combinations are: a) C-final adjective plus
syllabic postconsonantal suffix allomorphs, usually Sg -in and Pl -um (§4.5.1);
b) any word (usually a noun) plus syllabic allomorph i^˘ of the ‘it is’ or Focus
clitic (§11.2.1).
     Consider first the adjectives in (144). Here I show both the unsuffixed
stem, used in modifying function for nonhuman referents and (for any referent)
as a predicate, and a suffixed Sg form for human singular referents. In (144.c) I
include a long-voweled adjective, in fact the only Cv˘C adjective in my lexicon.
A moraic transcription showing mora-by-mora tone associations, and
syllabification with brackets, are given in addition to regular transcriptions.

their tones by Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading (137), which extends the final
tone of the preceding morpheme into the suffix.
     Since (144.a) is all-H-toned, resyllabification in the suffixed forms requires
no tonal modifications. However, in the contour-toned cases (144.b-c),
resyllabification has left behind a monotonal medial syllable. The stem-final
sonorant is now the onset of the word-final syllable. As syllabic onset, it is non-
moraic, and the tone it brings with it to the final syllable cannot be directly
expressed. However, this is moot since Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading
(137) has already copied the tone in question onto the nucleus of the final
syllable.

Resyllabification of the stem-final consonant has no tonal effect on the stem-
final syllable. In (145.b-c), on the other hand, resyllabification deprives the
stem-final syllable of its second tone-component, which is relocated into the
final syllable. The output be$ni^˘ with F-toned clitic instead of #be$ni&˘ $ with
final <LHL> is handled by Clitic <LHL>-Reduction (§3.7.4.7, below). For this
to work, however, it is first necessary to specify that a tone component
associated (after resyllabification) with a syllable-initial consonant is transferred
to the nucleus of that syllable.
128     Phonology
      Of particular interest is the way resyllabification applies to relative-clause
participles ending in Sg -n or Pl -m. Such a participle can have a final-syllable
contour tone under two conditions. First, since all verbs end in an H-toned mora
in their lexical form, the floating L-tone added to the end of the stem to form the
unsuffixed Imperfective ends up being expressed on the suffixal nasal. Thus
/a@˘- L -m/ ‘catch.Impf-Ppl.Sg’ with floating L-tone and Pl Participial -n is
realized as a@˘-m$ [a@am@ $]. Adding the ‘it is’ clitic y$ (postconsonantal allomorph
i^˘), we get a@˘-mi $˘, via the derivation (146).(146)    a.   /[a@˘- L -m] i^˘/    underlying
         b.   /a@˘-m$] i^˘/        floating L docks on suffixal mora

                                    tone on clitic
         e. a@˘-mi $˘              Clitic <LHL>-Reduction     Consider now the unsuffixed Perfective participle corresponding to the
unsuffixed Imperfective participle a@˘-m$ just described. With H(H…)L tone
overlay, we get a^˘-m. Although I distinguish Imperfective a@˘-m$ and Perfective
a^˘-m in transcription, they are homophonous when word-final. However, the
phonological distinction is apparent when the ‘it is’ clitic is added. Whereas
Imperfective a@˘-m$ appears as a@˘-mi $˘ as just seen, Perfective a^˘-m appears as
a^˘-mi^˘. The derivation of this form requires that both tone components of the
stem’s F-tone (i.e. <HL>) be associated with the stem vowel rather than with
the suffixal nasal when the clitic induces resyllabification. This entails ordering
resyllabification before Contour-Tone Stretching (143), which is therefore bled
(=prevented from applying) (147).(147)    a. /[a^˘-m] i ˘^ /        underlying (after tone overlay)

3.4.1     Short and (oral) long vowelsSince Jamsay favors Cv and Cv˘ syllables, with relatively few consonant
clusters (except in compounds and noun-adjective combinations), vowel length
oppositions are common and are generally easy to hear. A minimal pair is jE$rE@-
‘harvest [verb]’ versus jE$˘rE@- ‘bring’.
     Long vowels in nonfinal syllables within stems (and words) are common in
all word classes. Examples of short and (oral) long nonfinal vowels are given in
(37).(37)      quality short-V ex.        gloss           long-V ex. gloss          u         du@du@ru@m       ‘trash heap’    bu@˘du$    ‘money’

          i         si@ne) @-        ‘sniffle’       si@˘Ne$    ‘dark grey cow’    In medial position, long vowels are uncommon (and are not possible in verb
stems). Cases observed include arguably composite (e.g. reduplicated) stems
                                                                    3.4 Vowels    41like du$-du@˘ru@ ‘gourd’ and pu$˘-pa@˘ ‘blacksmith’s bellows’, and a few loanwords
(from Fulfulde) like la@yya@˘ru$ ‘Feast of the Ram’.
     All verb stems of more than one syllable end in a short vowel in their basic
form. Nouns, adjectives, and other stems may end in a short or long vowel (or in
a consonant) regardless of the number of syllables, but final long vowels are
less common than final short vowels even for nouns and adjectives if the stem
has more than one syllable. Some noun stems with final long vowel are the
following (note that some can be analysed as initial Ci- reduplications, as
Cv˘-Cv˘ full-stem iterations, or as beginning with semi-segmentable a$-): di -$ dE@˘
‘shield’, li -$ lE&˘ ‘fear’, a@se^˘ ‘Saturday’ (ultimately Arabic), ba$˘bi^˘ ‘rubber
sandal’, bE$ru$-a$ji@˘ ‘billy-goat’, ba$lpç@˘ ‘calabash drum’, and bu$to@˘ ‘Mitragyna
tree’. Additional cases of final long oral vowel are created by morphonological
rules, e.g. Imperfective verbs (type yç$˘rç^˘ ‘will cook on fire’, from /yç$rç@-L/).
     Monosyllabic stems, other than nouns and adjectives that end in a
consonant, have a shape Cv˘ with long vowel. All monosyllabic verbs are of this
type. Examples are the verbs ya&˘ ‘go’, dç&˘- ‘insult’, and ba@˘- ‘learn’, and the
nouns du@˘ ‘burden’, de&˘ ‘father’, and bE@˘ ‘excrement’. No short-voweled Cv
verb, noun, or adjective stems occur.
     Word-final super-heavy syllables of the shape Cv˘C are attested but
somewhat uncommon. The final C is a sonorant (nasal, semivowel, or l), as in
a$-ce&˘N ‘agama lizard’. Many if not all of these cases involve historical loss of a
word-final high vowel, cf. ce$˘Nu@ ‘agama lizard’ in some other Dogon
languages. The same syllable type occurs on the surface in apocopated verbal
nouns of the shape Cv&˘C-Ø associated with Cv˘Cv- verbs whose final consonant
is one of the relevant sonorants, e.g. n)E@˘-w<E@- ‘feed’, VblN n)E&˘-w<-Ø ‘feeding’
(apocopated from /n)E$˘-w<-u@/).","[62, 63]"

4.7.1.3    Decimal units (‘10’, ‘20’, …) and combinations (‘11’, ‘59’, …)Decimal units (multiples of ‘10’) are in (239). pE@ru@ ‘10’ is repeated from
above. The other decimal terms are compounds with pE@ru@- ‘ten’ as the initial
and the relevant single-digit numeral from ‘2’ to ‘9’ as the final. (One could
think of them as noun-numeral combinations with ‘ten’ as the noun, but the tone
patterns in ’60’ through ‘90’ are not regular for noun-numeral sequences.)
    The final numeral in each term for ‘20’ through ‘90’ has its regular form.
The initial ‘ten’ stem is subject to tone-dissimilation (§3.7.3.4), taking (or
rather keeping) the form pE@ru@- before a numeral beginning in L-tone (’20-50’)
and the form pE$ru$- before one beginning in H-tone (’60-90’). This initial also
undergoes Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) before a coronal (except in ‘70’), and
the syncope feeds Rhotic Assimilation (77), resulting in cross-morpheme
geminates ll (‘20’, ‘90’), tt (‘30’), and nn (‘40’, ‘50’). ‘20-50’ reflect the usual
dropping of tone from R to L of ‘2-5’ numerals in phrase-final position.(239)     gloss        form          ‘10’         pE@ru@

numerals: u@ro@ pE@l-lE$y ‘twenty houses’.
    Combinations of decimal numeral D as just given in (239) plus single-digit
numeral S have the form [D [S sa@ƒa$]]. The morpheme sa@ƒa$ is not otherwise
used in the language, but based on the structure of the combinations it can be
thought of as meaning ‘plus’ or ‘remainder’. In ‘11’ through ‘19’, pE@ru@ ‘ten’ is
modified slightly to pE@rE@, and does not undergo Post-Sonorant Syncope (60),
186     Nominal, pronominal, and adjectival morphology
see (240.a). Because the decimal numeral D is not phrase-final, if it ends in a
numeral ‘2-5’ we often hear its R-tone (240.b-c). The same is true (often, but
not always) of a numeral ‘2-5’ immediately preceding sa@ƒa$, such as the second

4.7.1.4    Large numerals (‘100’, ‘1000’, …) and their compositesLarger numerals are based on the stems in (241), which can be followed by
modifying numerals.(241)        gloss          form          a. ‘hundred’      su&N (archaic)

             ‘million’  mi@lyç^˘< (<French)    The archaic term su&N seems to be fading from use. In traditional Dogon
counting, there is a tradition whereby ‘80’ replaces ‘100’ as the basis for
counting, particularly with money (see below). Thus dç$ƒç$-su&N ‘(the) Dogon
hundred’ is an alternative term for ‘80’.
    The higher numerals in (242) are nouns and can be followed by other
numerals to generate larger composite numerals. However, the different levels
(million, thousand, hundred, 1-99) are separated into distinct sub-phrases. This
does not usually affect such numerals when used in counting, so that no
modified noun occurs. For example, in [[tE@˘mE@dE^r nu&˘y<] pE@l-lE$y] ‘five
hundred twenty’ there is no prosodically marked break, and the R-tone of nu&˘y<
                                                               4.7 Numerals    187‘five’ is preserved due to the following numeral. However, when the modified
noun is present, a complex numeral can be broken up.
     In one construction, a modified noun is repeated at each level, and each
segment has its own intonation contour (242).(242)     [pe@˘ju@  mu$n)u@ lE$y]     [pe@˘ju@   tE@˘mE@dE^r   nu$˘y<]

          [sheep      ten-two]
          ‘two thousand, five hundred, (and) twenty sheep’    In the other possible construction, the modified noun is not repeated, but the
numerals from different levels are overtly conjoined, with the “dying-quail”
final intonation described in §3.8.3 at the end of each sub-phrase (243).(243)     [pe@˘ju@ mu$n)u@ lE$y] [tE@˘mE@dE^r nu$˘y<]         [pE@l-lE$y]

          ‘two thousand, five hundred, (and) twenty sheep’
4.7.1.5    CurrencyNumerals with values of one hundred or more are most commonly used in
connection with currency. As in all languages of the region (except French),
currency amounts are expressed in terms of the unit sometimes known as the
riyal (real). This was originally a valuable colonial silver franc, but it is now
equated with the smallest coin in circulation, the 5 franc CFA coin, worth (in
2007) about one U.S. cent. Therefore ‘500 CFA’ (prior to 2005 a banknote,
thereafter a coin) is expressed as ‘100 riyals’. The term for ‘riyal’ in Jamsay,
borrowed from Fulfulde, is bu@˘du$ (plus a quantifier), often shortened to bu^˘d
before a numeral, as in bu^˘d tu@ru@ ‘one riyal’.
     Without a quantifier, bu@˘du$ means ‘money’. A more authentic, but now less
common, term for ‘money’ is cE&˘ru$, whose primary sense is ‘cowry shell’ (now
decorative, but long ago used as a kind of currency).
     For very large currency amounts, the French borrowing mi@lyç^˘< is used,
denoting one million (not five million) francs. One million francs CFA is a sum
that most villagers would never see in cash, though a well-constructed house in
a town like Douentza can go for upwards of ten million (in 2007).
188     Nominal, pronominal, and adjectival morphology
4.7.1.6    Distributive numeralsNumerical distributivity is expressed by iterating (=completely repeating) the
numeral. In context, distributives can be glossed adverbially as ‘in groups of N’,
‘N apiece’ (e.g. price per commodity unit), ‘N at a time’, and so forth, where N
is the iterated numeral. Simple numerals ‘2-5’ with lexical R-tone keep this tone
in the first segment, but drop it to L-tone in normal speech style in the second
segment if it is phrase-final.(244)     lE&y-lE$y       yE$rE$-ba$
          two-two         come.Perf.L-3PlS
          ‘They came two at a time (by twos).’     Other representative distributives are tu@t-tu@ru@ ‘one by one, individually,
one at a time’, hence by extension ‘scattered, occasional, (a few) here and
there’, and ku@ro@y-ku@ro@y ‘six by six’.
     In decimal units ‘20’ and up, the compound initial ‘ten’ is optionally
omitted in the repetition: pE@l-lE$y pE@l-lE$y or pE@l-lE&y-lE$y ‘twenty by twenty’.
Similar reductions occur in more complex numerals.
     An unusual construction including Nonhuman pronoun ko@ (perhaps in
possessor function) and an apparent prefix a$- appeared in a passage about
earring types, from an elderly female speaker. The construction was only half-
understood by my younger assistant (245).(245)     [su$n     nu@No$] [a$-ta^˘n        ko@            ta&˘n]

will spend the night here (yi@-di ˘$ <)?’

immediately preceding discourse.(215)   a$sE$gE$-ma&N-Ø             ji $r<e$-bi@rE@,

.
    In (216), yi@-di $˘< has the same recent-discourse orientation, and is
contrasted with ni@-di ˘$ <, which points forward in the discourse. Both are
abstract, denoting blacksmiths’ activities rather than locations. di g

literally means ‘pass, go past’, so a locational adverb is appropriate.

     yi@-di ˘$ < may combine with be$-ru@, again referring to practices just described
in preceding discourse. The free translation is of the type ‘in those ways’ or ‘in
ways of that type’, suggesting that this be$-ru@ is the dative-locative-instrumental
form of postnominal Plural morpheme be@ (not that of 3Pl pronoun be@).
However, this use of be$-ru@ is routinized and its morphological structure may be
less than transparent to native speakers. In addition to (218), this be$-ru@ occurs
in the first line of (216). See also §4.4.3.3.(218)    i^-n      [yi@-di ˘$ < be$-ru@],   da$na@       tu@mno^˘-Ø

it is repeated several times (‘over there …, over there …, over there …’) in a
passage using different deictic “locations” to distinguish different
specializations that young hunters can adopt. Some cases of yE@-di ˘$ < in (219.b)
may actually be focalized; the Focus clitic in yE@-di $˘<y< would be difficult to
hear in tape recordings.(219)    a. yE@-di ˘$ <  [be$-ru@  di $˘<    be$      be^˘-Ø]

             hunt has now begun to diversify.’ 2004.3.16     The yE@- in yE@-di ˘$ < is probably related historically to yE@ in its function as an
alternative third person subject pronoun, which has a presentative nuance
(§4.3.3, above), and to Existential particle yE@ used chiefly with positive ‘be’ and
‘have’ quasi-verbs (§11.2.2.1).
     The first morpheme in ye@-le@ or ye$-le@ is perhaps a variant of yE@- just
discussed, with the vowel assimilated to that of -le@ (cf. H-toned postposition le@,
§8.2.2). ye@-le@ or ye$-le@ is discourse-anaphoric in sense. In (220), a location is
first introduced deictically in a quotation as yi -$ le@ ‘here’, and is then referred to
anaphorically as ye$-le@ ‘there’.(220)    […      [ta$ƒa$     wo@m]      yi -$ le@  yç@kç$]         ga@,

         and showed (it to us), they said that we should stay there [focus].’
         2004.3.11    In (221), at the beginning of an animal tale, ye$-le@ likewise refers to a
location already defined (by the presence of Camel).(221)    [ç$ƒç$-n)ç$wç@ [e$ju@  le@] ko@    ya@ra$]              jE@   me$y<,

172     Nominal, pronominal, and adjectival morphology
    Similar instances of ye$-le@ occurred in other narratives, where the first
protagonist’s location defines an initial deictic center, to which a second
protagonist comes. Further examples of ye$-le@ are (327), (550.b), (604), (999.a),
(1021.c), and the last line of (1017); more examples of H-toned ye@-le@ are (423),
(563). (916.d), (1150), and the second line of (1017).","[190, 191, 192, 193, 194]"
