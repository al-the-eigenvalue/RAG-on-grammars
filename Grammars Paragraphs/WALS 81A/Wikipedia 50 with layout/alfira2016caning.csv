general meaning of ‘some people’. When this subject prefix has this meaning, it is as if the
verb is done by an unmentioned subject, which is like a passive verb in other languages.",[177]

                                         IntroductionIn the Caning language there are different types of words: nouns, verbs, prepositions,
pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, and connectors. We will learn about these in this book. We will
also learn about how the words go together into groups of words called phrases, clauses, and
sentences. The words and how they go together are called grammar.","[3, 4]"

The following pronouns can take the place of the subject noun kig ‘person’ in (1). The verb
prefix (beginning of words) or suffix changes from one subject pronoun to the next.","[36, 37]"
"The following pronouns can take the place of the object noun op ‘young man’ in (2). Object
pronouns are written as separate words from the verb they follow. (See spelling rule 9).",[37]
"Different prefixesNearly all verbs have subject prefixes that change with the subject pronoun before the verb.
The subject prefixes on incomplete verbs are different than on complete verbs.",[129]
"Identifying suffixes4 can be an equal sign in a sentence without a verb. In this way they help
identify or tell information about certain nouns. They can show the end of an identifying
relative clause (a group of words with a verb that tells which noun we are talking about). They
can also show a clause depends on another clause to make a complete sentence. They can also
show the end of a phrase (group of words without a verb) that is in focus, the most important
words of the sentence.",[85]
"In (Pedi 7-8), the subject prefix sa- ‘they’ on sadogäng ‘they give’ are unmentioned people.
This action is done to the object abisoloni ‘sorghum’ which comes before the verb sadogäng.",[177]
"                               Repeating (pluralactional) verbsA repeating verb shows an action happens more than once or continues a long time. It can also
emphasize the subject is more than one person, or can emphasize the object receiving the action
is more than one. [check this]. Repeating suffixes include –d-. They can be on incomplete or
complete verbs. They can be on transitive verbs or on intransitive verbs.",[165]

Modifier connector suffixes show a noun is described by the following word or clause (a group
of words with a verb). The following word(s) can be an adjective, a quantity, or a descriptive
relative clause (a clause describing the previous noun). All these words describe or give more
information about the noun.","[67, 68]"
"Pronouns can be used as subjects, objects, be introduced by prepositions, or be possessors.",[36]
"                      Unmentioned object suffixes (Antipassive, detransitive)Unmentioned object suffixes show that a transitive verb has an unstated object that receives the
action. Verbs cannot have both an unmentioned object suffix –za and a stated object; they can
only have one or the other. When the meaning is clear, a transitive verb can be without both the
object and the unmentioned object suffix. So, if the object is known, the unmentioned object
suffix may show importance to the unstated object. If the object is not known, the unmentioned
object suffix may show the object is not mentioned on purpose. [check this]In (N&A 17-18), the unmentioned object suffix shows there is an unstated object receiving the
action of käzäkey ‘reported’. The object is the situation of Hyena claiming his bull gave birth to
a calf and claiming it as his own.",[180]

verbs and not to complete verbs. A continous suffix can attach to either transitive verbs (which
can have an object) or intransitive verbs (which cannot have an object). However, when the
continuous suffix is attached to a transitive verb, it cannot have an object.",[162]

How can we tell if a verb is incomplete or complete? An incomplete verb has no prefix when a
noun subject such as kig ‘person’ does the action. A complete verb has the prefix kä- or ka-
when a noun subject such as kig ‘person’ does the action.","[138, 139]"

kasiy ‘eat’.",[35]

possessed, the object of a verb, or used in other ways as nouns. Most verbal nouns only have a
plural form which takes plural suffixes, but a few have both a singular and plural form. Many
verbal nouns have the suffixes –ad, ed, -id or -d, but some verbal nouns are without any suffix,
and are the same as the verb root.",[172]
