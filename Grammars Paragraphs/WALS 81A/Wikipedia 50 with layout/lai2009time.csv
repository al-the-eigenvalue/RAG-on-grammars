2.3.1 Basic Word Order       This section discusses and defines the basic word order of Iquito. The discussionof basic word order here concerns only the surface word order. It does not deal withtheoretical assumptions concerning the underlying word order from which the surfaceword order is derived. The study of basic word order is based on the assumption thatthere is always one basic word order in all languages which is syntactically defined bythe relative order among principal constituents. This assumption generally stands exceptin the case where the word order of the language is free, is pragmatically constrained ordefined rather than syntactically based, or the appearance of both constituents (i.e.grammatical subject and object) in a clause is rare, in which case, defining any basicword order for such languages could be forced to some extent. However, as Mithun(1987) points out, “for languages with relatively rigid, syntactically defined surface wordorder, the establishment of this order at the outset has obvious utility. The description ofrarer, morphologically and pragmatically marked alternative orders as the result of themovement of constituents out of their normal position is mechanically simple.” The basicword order of a language refers to the relative order among principal constituents in oneclause. The principal constituents of a transitive clause include subject, verb and object.","[62, 63]"
"In the above examples, both subject and object are pronouns.17 Two additional sentencesusing full noun phrases as the subject and the object are shown below to demonstrate that
word order patterns remain the same regardless of types of constituents. Example (4) witha nominal subject and object shows the SVO pattern, and example (5) with a nominalsubject and object shows the SOV pattern.",[66]
"Many languages, although not allowing free word order, allow more than one possible
word order. In Iquito, this is also the case. However, a sentence with basic word order ischaracterized as being least specific and least marked, morphologically as well aspragmatically, and although frequency of use is not a necessary part of the definition ofbasic word order, in Iquito the most common word order is in fact the basic word order.",[63]

The seven categories include ‘inanimateindefinite,’ ‘inanimate definite,’ ‘animate indefinite,’ ‘animate definite,’ ‘personalindefinite,’ ‘personal definite’ and ‘proper name.’ These seven different categories,applying to the subject and object, generate forty-nine different expressions. The result of

                                                  46
the study concludes that animacy, definiteness and phrase weight do not operate on thepattern of word order in simple transitive clauses and that the basic word order of Iquitois SVO. In deciding basic word order, this chapter considers sentences containing thefollowing characteristics: independent transitive clause, affirmative, realis mood andactive voice. In addition, the subject and the object have to be expressed and representedin complete and full nominal phrases, for example, those including nouns as opposed topronouns. In Iquito, there is no agreement information (e.g. person, number, gender,class, etc.) of grammatical arguments marking on the verb, and the alignment system,based on word order, exhibits an accusative pattern. It is noted that although pronouns inIquito are not agreement inflection markers, they were excluded from the preliminarystage of investigation and the following examples do not contain them. A sentence withthe basic word order is shown as in (1). As can be seen, the relative order among theprincipal constituents in the clause is SVO.","[64, 65]"
"       In addition to subordinate clauses, Iquito also displays numerous unexpected OVcorrelations in terms of word order typology as discussed in Dryer (1991, 1992): (1) ituses postpositions instead of prepositions; (2) the time/aspect (aux) information followsthe verbal root, utilizing suffixes instead of prefixes; (3) in possessive noun phrases, thegenitive precedes the noun instead of following it; (4) and finally, the copula verb followsthe predicate instead of preceding it. According to typological studies, languages tend toretain their old word order in embedded clauses. Iquito, therefore, could have once beenan OV language. However, what remains to be confirmed is the motivation of such achange of basic word order and why SOV, a variety of SXV word order, is retained inirrealis clauses. Two explanations are offered in the following. One is that in sentenceswith S[V(V)….OV] constituent order, all elements after the subject through the sentence-final verb historically constitute a complex object phrase, with the final verb as theprincipal verb. Throughout the historical development, some non-principal lexical verbswere frequently used and grammaticalized into tense and aspect morphemes, resulting ingrammatical morphemes being positioned in the post-subject position and motivatingthe SVO word order in the simple clause. The other possible explanation is that the wordorder change in the simple clause is a relatively recent and drastic innovation becauseSVO word order, distributively more restricted, only appears in the realis simple clause.",[183]
"       Grammatical mood in Iquito (detailed in §4) is realis or irrealis. Iquitorealis/irrealis mood is expressed by word order change and vowel-hiatus resolution,                                              72
which is unique among strategies that are attested to date. SVO is the basic word order(Eastman & Eastman, 1963; Lai, 2005) and conveys realis mood. It occurs in finite realisclauses with no element allowed to appear between the subject and the verb, as in (62)and (63). Irrealis mood, however, generally requires an element to occupy the positionbetween the subject and the verb, resulting in SXV word order. The X position in SXVorder can be filled by an indefinite grammatical object (64), a pronoun object (65), thedeterminer of a definite object phrase (66) or an adverb (67), among others (Anderson etal, 2006). In a counterfactual construction, an additional counterfactual morphemeappears after the subject (68).","[90, 91]"
"Moreover, when the subject is indefinite, the word order in an intransitive clause is SVinstead of VS. It is noted that the translation of subject phrase in English shows that it issemantically and syntactically indefinite in this language. Example (19) shows that thebare nominal subject precedes the verb.",[72]
"The question word in the sentence is the direct object. The subject is a pronoun nu ‘3S’and caa appears after it in the preverbal position, which forms the SXV word order toexpress the irrealis mood. The indirect object remains in the postverbal position.",[193]
"         In sentence (283), -ji marks the verb, followed by the negative particle caa,displaying the basic pattern of ji-caa negation. The wh-word is the subject, followed bythe object phrase nu-nasi ‘his garden,’72 followed in turn by the verb. This is theconfiguration of irrealis mood (SXV word order).",[192]
"4.2.3 Possible Origins69 of Irrealis Word order        Expressing mood through word order change is typologically unusual andinteresting. So far, there has not been another language reported in the literature thatutilizes a comparable approach. Irrealis word order in Iquito might be the result of a wordorder retention or word order change through historical development. That is to say, it is
possible that 1) SOV (i.e. as one of the varieties of SXV word order) is the old wordorder and is retained in infinitival clauses as well as retained in or extended to irrealisclauses, or that 2) SVO has been the word order and SXV is a new strategy in irrealisclauses.",[180]
Sentence (262) is analyzed as taking a non-finite participle phrase as the object and hencedoes not use the irrealis word order.,[178]
"Dryer, Matthew S. (1992). The Greenbergian Word Order Correlations. Language 68:
       81-138.",[621]
"       It is important to mention that SV is basic word order in intransitives, just as intransitive clauses. When the subject is a non-topicalized, definite nominal phrase, onlythe definite article precedes the verb, with the bare nominal remaining after the verb. Ascan be seen in (17), the determiner iina begins the sentence and appears before the verband the bare subject appears after, showing a discontinuous S. The word order in example(17) is DVS (D stands for determiner/demonstrative).",[71]
       Examples (449)-(452) show the imperatives of Accomplishments with explicitplural addressees and Deictic Perfective Aspects. The subject pronoun is not optional. Itcan also be observed that the word order of the sentences reflects SVX realis word order.,[269]
"       Besides all the above-mentioned points, the SVO word order indeed appears veryfrequently in the texts, and it is usually the word order which starts a discourse. Based onall these factors, SVO should be considered as the basic word order which fulfills thecriterion of descriptive simplicity.",[73]
"In (284), caa precedes and follows the verb which is marked with -ji. The questionedelement here is the subject as well. However, the object nu-naana ‘his wood’ does notappear between the subject and the verb, but remains in the postverbal position. In
comparison with the above example, the negative particle caa in the current exampleappears postverbally as well as preverbally, forming a linear SXV Word order to fulfillthe requirement of irrealis mood. Compare this sentence with (286) below.",[192]
"Irrealis mood in finite clauses,56 however, generally requires an element to occupy the
position between the subject and the verb, resulting in SXV word order. The X positionin an SXV order can be filled by an indefinite grammatical object, an adverb, or thedeterminer of a definite object phrase, among others (Anderson et al., 2006). To add towhat is proposed in this literature, I propose that when the X position is not filled by anovert lexical item, the vowel-hiatus resolution strategy between S and V is blocked.",[159]
"Irrealis mood is characterized as allowing an intervening element between the subject andthe verb in the X position. A variety of elements could appear in the X position, includinggrammatical object and adverbs, among others, as detailed in §4.2. This section focuses

on defining the basic word order as SVO. I argue in the following that SXV word order isactually highly marked and that SVO is the true basic one.","[65, 66]"
"This section considers transitive and non-topicalized sentences. Lai (2006) includesexamples of all possible variants which might influence, crosslinguistically, theplacement of nominal phrases, including animacy, definiteness and the weight of the
                                            45
phrase, e.g. full phrases vs. pronouns. I argue that the basic word order in Iquito is SVOinstead of SOV and that animacy, definiteness and the phrase weight play no role indeciding the basic word order for Iquito. The following is a table to illustrate all word-order variations in a finite clause with one lexical verb.","[63, 64]"
"One might attempt to group S and O together as opposed to A (i.e. agent, the subject of atransitive verb) in terms of grammatical relations, based on the subject position shown in                                            53
(17). However, there are several points we have to make clear. While we can get adiscontinuous S in a realis indicative single-verb intransitive clause, we never get adiscontinuous O in a realis indicative single-verb transitive clause. As can be seen in (18),the word order is DAVDO (SVO). We do not get a discontinuous O.","[71, 72]"
"         In Iquito, word order conveys grammatical mood: SVX (realis mood) and SXV(irrealis mood). Note that SOV is one of the varieties of SXV orders detailed below.",[65]
"       The other possible word-order development is that SVO has been the basic wordorder and that SXV is a new strategy in irrealis clauses and a new phenomenon inembedded infinitival clauses and complex predicate contexts. Complex predicates,especially complements of cognition verbs and the like, might plausibly be associatedwith irrealis mood (Patience Epps, p.c.). Here the explanation needed is the mechanismof such a word-order-change strategy. Hopper and Thompson (1980) correlate variationsin word order and relative verbal transitivity, such as noun incorporation, withaffectedness or individuation of object, which is also associated with irrealis mood. It is,therefore, that noun incorporation is the drive of SVO to SXV change. However, thisscenario seems unlikely since there is almost no noun incorporation in Iquito, which isdistinct from most of the Amazonian languages. The motivation of SVO to SXV changealso remains to be a topic for future research.       §4.2 above gives an outline of the Iquito irrealis mood. It discusses the structuralfacts of the realis and irrealis word order, and the kinds of semantic contexts in which                                            166
each mood is employed. Iquito evidently adopts an extremely uncommon strategy, wordorder change, to encode the irrealis mood. The present study proposes to include this asone of the grammatical types by which modality can be expressed typologically. Thediscussion of this section also attempts to trace the origin of this uncommon means froma typological approach on word-order correlations. It is suggested that the earlier wordorder of Iquito might have been SOV and it gradually developed into SVO word order.","[184, 185]"
"       (Literally: Would it make her drink masato!)       Irrealis word order appears in the subordinate clauses of desiderative/timitiveverbs. The matrix verb of (260) and (261) is nacar++- ‘want/like/hope’ and thesubordinated finite clause, as indicated by square brackets, exhibits irrealis word order.",[177]
"In (263), qu+r++- ‘fear’ is the matrix verb and the subordinate clause also exhibitsirrealis word order. In the subordinate clause, iina m+yaara ‘that dog’ is in the topicposition and the resumptive subject pronoun nu ‘3S’ precedes the definite article of theobject.",[178]

The motivation of this might be a calque of Spanish sentence structure from the recentacquisition of the Spanish language. Both options are possible. However, one synchronicobservation is that Arabela, which supposedly forms a branch of the Zaparoan familywith Andoa, is predominantly SOV while Záparo, which supposedly forms a branch withIquito, is SVO. SVO word order is therefore a shared innovation, if indeed a new wordorder, within the Záparo-Iquito branch. However, an Iquito text in Beuchat and Rivet inthe 18th century displays SVO order (Lev Michael, p.c.). The above discussion suggestslanguage contact is a less likely scenario since all Zaparoan languages have contact withSpanish, but present distinct synchronic facts. If SOV is indeed the old word order andSVO is a new word order, the motivation of such a change remains to be a topic forfuture research.","[183, 184]"
"4.2 GRAMMATICAL MOOD: REALIS AND IRREALIS        Iquito has a grammaticalized realis/irrealis mood which is expressed by atypologically uncommon strategy, word order change and vowel-hiatus resolution.55 Thebasic word order in Iquito is SVO, which appears in all finite clauses with realis mood.",[159]
"         Perfective Aspect: The simplest deictic interpretation is past, unless a word order         change (SXV word order which indicates irrealis mood) is involved, in which         case, the situation is located in the future.",[132]
"REMPFV is used in past contexts with realis word order (SVX), in remote-futuresituations with irrealis word order (SXV), and in imperative constructions. This sectiondiscussed the first two uses in detail and introduced the use of REMPFV in imperatives.",[362]
"When used in past contexts (i.e. sentences in realis word order), it specifically indicates aperfective situation realized in the morning, including before sunrise. When used infuture contexts (i.e. sentences in irrealis word order), it indicates a situation in the remotefuture. Therefore, when REMPFV is used in a sentence with Extended Current Tense, theRT of which spans from the day of SpT to the infinite future, such a sentence receivespossible temporal references of either earlier in the day, including before sunrise or in themorning, or further in the future within approximately two years from SpT. The specificinterpretation depends on the use of grammatical mood, realized by word order change(i.e. realis word order (SVX) in past situations and irrealis word order (SXV) in futuresituations) and vowel-hiatus resolution.",[345]
"        In the past-tense environment, SVO word order maintains the same kinds ofmorphological markings, while SOV word order cannot appear with only tense-aspectinformation as demonstrated above in (3) and (5), but has to be accompanied by eithercounterfactual or hypothetical morphemes.18 As can be seen in (1) above, SVO wordorder in the past-tense environment only changes its tense morpheme and so still has thesame kinds of morphological markings. However, SXV word order in the past contextcan only be used in conditional and counterfactual constructions and has to beaccompanied by either the non-assertive hypothetical morpheme or the counterfactual
morpheme. It cannot be used with just tense-aspect information. Example (6) is a casewith a counterfactual morpheme. As can be seen, the counterfactual morpheme -t++ andindirect O nu ‘3S’ are inserted between S and V, providing evidence to support the claimthat SXV, with intervening elements between S and V, is a marked word order.",[67]
"       Note that in sentences with a complex verbal predicate, for example, those havingembedded infinitival clauses besides the main verb, the word order does not display astraightforward SVO pattern. Instead, it exhibits an SVV...OV pattern, which is also thecase in the irrealis environment (SOV word order). Example (15) is an example of acomplex verbal phrase in the SVO environment, and (16) is an example of it in the SOVenvironment. It is seen that both sentences using complex predicates display the sameword order pattern—SVV…OV—no matter whether they are in realis mood (SVX) or inirrealis mood (SXV).",[70]

The antecedent contains a Stative verb and the Imperfective Aspect is used,indicating overlapping SitT of situations in two clauses. The sentence means ‘I will visityou during the time while I can.’ It can be seen that Extended Current Tense is used inboth clauses. The antecedent exhibits realis word order while the consequent exhibitsirrealis word order.",[206]
"        Consider first the following two sentences. In (2), we can see that the subjectbegins the sentence and the object follows the verb, displaying an SVO pattern. In (3), thesubject and the object are attached together at the beginning of the sentence, displayingan SOV pattern. Note that pronoun clitics, which are not agreement markers, are notobligatory if a nominal phrase is used as subject or object.",[66]
"         In addition to declaratives and interrogatives of future situations, irrealis mood isalso used in CF conditionals. Sentence (256) is a CF conditional, consisting of a CFantecedent clause of a recent past situation, and a present CF consequent clause. As canbe seen, the subject is followed by a CF morpheme, followed by the object, displayingSOV order. In (257), the element following the CF morpheme in the antecedent is anadverb, and that in the consequent is a determiner of an object phrase. Different types ofelements can fill the position between the subject and the verb in an irrealis clause. Thisis discussed in more detail in §4.2.2.",[176]
"In (362), the verb nacar++- ‘want’ takes an inflected clausal complement. Theembedded clause reflects the irrealis word order SXV, with the determiner of the objectphrase situated between the subject and the verb. General Perfective Aspect is used in theembedded clause to indicate that the speaker expects the addressee to realize the eventsoon after SpT. Sentence (363) shows that the demonstrative iina and the embedded finiteclause in (362) are in equivalent positions in terms of clausal structure.",[233]
"        A conditional construction in Iquito consists of two clauses—an antecedent clauseand a consequent clause. There is a fairly strong preference for ordering the antecedentclause before the consequent clause. There are counterfactual (CF) and non-counterfactual (non-CF) conditionals (detailed in §4.4) in Iquito. Tense, Mood, andAspect in both CF and non-CF conditionals is ‘real’ in the sense that they receive the
                                            67
same temporal, modal and aspectual interpretations as they do in non-conditionals. Thecounterfactuality difference between CF conditionals and non-CF conditionals isexpressed by a specialized CF morpheme (+)t+,22 which always accompanies SXV
irrealis word order and conveys CF meaning by entailment instead of implicature. As in(52), the CF morpheme appears directly following the subject, in this case, between thesubject and the adverb in the antecedent clause and between the subject and the definitearticle of the object phrase in the consequent clause. The object phrase in the consequentclause is discontinuous as the definite article precedes the verb while the nominal followsthe verb.","[85, 86]"
"It is seen that all three sentences above with complex predicates display the same wordorder pattern—SV(V)…OV. Mood is only expressed in the finite clause and does notdetermine the order of the non-finite clause since the grammatical information offiniteness is not relevant. In addition, because the subject of the verb in a non-finiteclause is not always present and, therefore, there is no condition of talking about moodconstruction, which is based principally on the adjacency of subject and verb. The wordorder of non-finite clauses can be variable. The following three sentences have theirembedded clauses as non-finite.",[181]
"When used in the past context, it conveys a bounded (i.e. closed) event in which SitToverlaps with RT. It generally renders an inceptive reading in Stative sentences. Whenthe adverbial jaa ‘already’ is used, the sentence presents properties of the perfect inwhich SitT precedes RT. When used in the context of the immediate future, the sentence106 For a detailed discussion of grammatical mood, please refer to §4.
107 When speakers talk about events that will take place on the same day, they use different strategies:
Imperfective Aspect -yaa ~ -: with the realis word order (SVO) if they view the situation as already in
progress; General Perfective Aspect -qui ~ -Ø with the irrealis word order (SXV) if they view the situation
as being realized later on the day of SpT with more distance; Momentary Perfective Aspect -r++ with the
irrealis word order (SXV) if they view the situation with even greater temporal distance.

displays irrealis word order and an explicit reference time is usually given, but notrequired. The sentence indicates that the action will be realized on the same day as SpT.","[294, 295]"
"       When the situation in the sentences is in non-immediate future (i.e. from as soonas later on the same day of SpT to the more remote future), irrealis mood is used. Again,this applies to both affirmative and negative declaratives, interrogatives, and non-CFconditionals. Sentence (251) refers to a situation which the speaker states that he willrealize later in the same day of SpT. As can be seen, the subject qui ‘1S’ is followed bythe object núquiica anitáaqui ‘a peccary,’ followed by the verb pani- ‘search.’ Thesentence displays SOV word order, expressing irrealis mood.",[173]
