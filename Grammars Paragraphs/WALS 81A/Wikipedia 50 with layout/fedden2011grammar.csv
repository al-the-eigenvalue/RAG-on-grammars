1.3.        Typological profileMian has a relatively small segmental phoneme inventory though of fairly
typical shape and size by Papuan standards. An unusual feature of the
segmental inventory is the presence of a contrast between a plain /a/ (spelled
<a>) and a pharyngealized /a/ (spelled <aa>). The tonal phonology is
complex. Mian is a word tone language, i.e. the domain for the assignment of
                                                        1.3. Typological profile   7one of five tonal melodies (H, L, LH, LHL, and HL) is the phonological word,
not the syllable. Lexemes are specified for one tonal melody and an accent
which serves as the anchor point for the melody. Tonal melodies spread over
the entire phonological word including all affixes and most clitics. Verbal and
nominal compounds are treated as a single word phonologically, i.e. they have
one tonal melody (i.e. a composite of both stem tones) and one accent. The
tonal inventory of compounds is a proper subset of the tonal melodies found
on monomorphemic words. While the function of tone is mainly to make
lexical distinctions, there is one tense (the non-hodiernal past) which is
marked tonally for some verbs in addition to a suffix.
   There is hardly any nominal inflectional morphology. The only inflectional
noun suffix is -wal, which signals plural and only attaches to a subset of the
noun vocabulary to boot, namely kin nouns, dyads, and proper names, where it
indicates an associative plural. If a noun is used referentially, it is followed by
a cliticized article which is etymologically related to the third person free
pronouns. There is a tendency to use inanimate nouns without this marker,
even if they are used referentially. There are several derivational noun
suffixes which derive adverbs from nouns and express meanings like
instrumental, e.g. sbun-dum ‘with a spoon’. Furthermore, there is a
derivational suffix -an, which attaches to either nouns or adjectives to form
verbs. The meaning is inchoative, e.g. ayam ‘good’ and ayam-an- ‘become
good’. These derived forms are further inflected as intransitive verbs.
   Mian has four genders: Masculine, feminine, neuter 1 and neuter 2 which
are defined by sets of agreement markers. Agreement targets are the
adnominally used pronouns, the article and demonstratives, and the
pronominal affixes on the verb.
   The structure of the noun phrase is relatively simple and constituent order
within the noun phrase is fixed. The leftmost position is the possessor slot. It
can be filled by a possessive pronoun or a noun phrase expressing the
possessor. Most adjectival modifiers and quantifiers follow the noun. The
adjectives sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ tend to precede the noun but they can
also follow it. The rightmost position in the noun phrase is reserved for a
determiner, e.g. a clitic pronominal article or an adnominally used emphatic
pronoun. The clitic article can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and
show up on the head noun, all adjectival modifiers, and on numerals. Mian has
prenominal and head-internal relative clauses. The former are unmarked
clauses embedded in the noun phrase before the head noun, the latter are
essentially clausal noun phrases and end with a determiner, such as an article.
   Mian only has postpositions many of which have a noun origin.
   About half of the Mian verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with
formally distinct perfective and imperfective stems. This is a typical feature of
the Ok languages and also found in Telefol and Tifal. Outside of Ok, aspect
8   1. The language and its speakersdistinctions in the stem can be found in the Papuan languages Marind and
Kiwai (Foley 1986: 146-148), in Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and in Abui
(Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86). Some verb stems (approximately 50) are defective
and lack either the perfective or the imperfective stem. The rest of the verb
stems are trans-aspectual and do not have a formal perfective-imperfective
distinction.
    Verbal morphology is complex. Mian is mainly a nominative-accusative
language though in a limited number of cases argument marking proceeds on
an absolutive basis, mainly – but not exclusively – with classificatory prefixes,
which index transitive objects and intransitive subjects. Alignment in
ditransitives is indirective.
    Mian is basically head-marking at the clause level and mildly
polysynthetic. Core arguments are subject (S) in intransitive clauses, subject
(A) and object (O) in monotransitive clauses, and subject (A), object (O) and
recipient (R) in ditransitive clauses. There is no morphological case- or
adpositional marking for these. Core arguments are cross-referenced on the
verb by cross-referencing affixes. These index all subjects and recipients. The
language is not fully head-marking at the clause level because many transitive
verbs do not index their object. Object prefixation is only found in a small
number of transitive verbs, including ‘see’, ‘kill’, ‘grab’, and ‘bite’.
    In the perfective, recipient arguments are introduced through a compound
construction with -(û)b’- ‘give’, or allomorphs thereof. In contemporary Mian,
-(û)b’- ‘give’ and its allomorphs serve a quasi-applicative function. In the
imperfective, recipient suffixes immediately follow the verb stem. The notion
of ‘recipient’ is semantically relatively general and includes benefactives and
malefactives, possessors, goals of ballistic motion, and experiencers.
    In addition to the argument affixes, which work on a nominative-
accusative basis, Mian has a set of classificatory verb prefixes which are
obligatory for some verbs, most of which involve the handling or
manipulation of objects, including predications such as ‘take’, ‘throw’, ‘give’,
and ‘fall’. The classificatory prefixes classify a verbal argument according to
semantic criteria, such as biological sex but also shape and function on an
absolutive basis, i.e. classification extends to the subject of intransitive verbs
and the object of transitive verbs. These prefixes are in many ways
reminiscent of classificatory verbal elements in various North-American
languages, e.g. Navajo and Diegueño.
    Inflectional tense, aspect, and mood marking is moderately complex. The
verb has two slots for TAM suffixes which are on either side of the subject
suffix slot. The pre-subject slot is filled by various tense, aspect, and mood
markers. The post-subject slot can only be filled by tense markers (which are
formally and semantically distinct from those in the pre-subject slot). There
                                                        1.3. Typological profile   9are some co-occurrence restrictions pertaining to the suffixes in these two
slots.
    Verbs are inflected directly for some TAM categories, but for others the
verb must be serialized with an auxiliary before the respective TAM suffixes
can attach.
    Mian makes pervasive use of chaining constructions. Verbs can be
serialized at the core or the nuclear level of the clause. Serialized verbs share
the same subject which is marked on the last verb in the construction. An
exception is the causative serial verb construction, in which subject marking
indexes the causer on the first verb of the serialization and the causee on the
second verb. The predications expressed by a core serial verb constructions
are of relatively low semantic integration and serialized transitive verbs
commonly have their own overt object noun phrases. Serializations on the
nuclear level of the clause are possible. They are tighter-knit than core
serializations and do not allow separate objects.
    Clause chaining is very common in Mian. Verbs can be medial and
function as the predicate of a medial clause or final and function as the
predicate of an independent sentence or the last clause in a clause chain.
Medial verbs show switch-reference morphology indicating whether the
subject of the succeeding clause is co-referent or disjoint in reference, in
addition to marking events as sequential or simultaneous. In languages that
use clause chaining, medial verbs are often morphologically impoverished.
Mian medial verbs, however, only have the morphological restriction that they
cannot be marked for polarity, irrealis or deontic mood or be followed by one
of the sentence-final illocutionary clitics. The Mian switch-reference system
has a typologically unusual property in that ‘same subject’ marking by -n only
forces the following subject to be co-referent in the first person singular. In all
other person-number combinations the switch-reference meaning of -n is
suspended and the suffix only indicates sequentiality of events.
    Adverbial clauses with temporal, locative or conditional meaning – like
head-internal relative clauses – are clausal noun phrases and function as
referring expressions in Mian. They are followed by the default neuter article
=o. Other embedded structures found in the language are embedded questions
and quotatives.
    Unmarked constituent orders in medial and final clauses and independent
sentences are SV and AOV. Due to the head-marking characteristics of the
language, constituent order is relatively flexible with the mandatory restriction
that the verb be clause-final. The verb can only be followed by =ba, signalling
negative polarity, and/or an illocutionary clitic particle, which marks
independent sentences or whole clause chains as declarative, exclamative,
interrogative, quotative, or hortative. Post-verbal locative adverbials following
motion verbs are possible but rare and always constitute their own intonational

9.10.2.     Argument order in ditransitive clausesTo distinguish the two objects in ditransitive clauses I use the following
abbreviations: O - theme object and R - recipient object. In ditransitive
                                                   9.10. Constituent order   365clauses, unmarked constituent order (i.e. most frequent in the corpus) is A R O
V. There is a tendency to order overt object noun phrases according to
animacy. R much more frequently refers to humans (or at least to animates)
since it encodes recipients or benefactives. Hence, it tends to occur before O.
    Ditransitive clauses in which all three core arguments are overtly realized
as free pronouns are unattested in the spontaneous corpus and only occur in
elicited material, e.g.:(98)   n     kbo        
       1SG    2SG.M       3SG.N1       tob-ûb’-ke-Ø-i-o=be
       3SG.LONG.O-give.PFV-2SG.R-REAL-1SG.SBJ-EP=DECL
       ‘I’ve given it (i.e. LONG) to you.’The same ordering principles can be observed when the objects are
instantiated by overt noun phrases, as in the following two examples:(99)   alél=o          al=o
       wife=SG.F       bowels=PL.N1       gwel-ûb’-o-s-e=a
       cut_out.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.F.R-DS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘he cut out the bowels (of an animal) for the wife and then she…’
       [Flood](100) Fu-taman         mín=e        mak=o       y

       ‘when they cut off some and gave (it) to the man from the Fu
       valley …’ [Danenok]Reverse order of objects, i.e. A O R V, is attested though much less frequent.
An example of this alternative constituent order in a ditransitive clause is
(101):(101)           lo                   mak=i
      3PL.AN     DEM.PROX.PL.N1        other=PL.AN

          ‘they give these (things) to the others and then someone else ...’
          [MPIP Reciprocals, 28 (Evans et al. 2004)]The most important generalization with respect to the position of the subject
noun phrase in ditransitive clauses is that it must not appear between the two
object noun phrases, i.e. the subject noun phrase can precede (102) or follow
the two objects together (103):(102) n           kbo         monî=o

          ‘While a pig was eating a man’s taro (, the man…)’ [Pig story]
9.10.3.     Position of non-argumentsThe most important non-arguments, whose syntactic behaviour will be
described here, are:-     adverbs
-     postpositional adjuncts
-     nominal adjuncts
-     temporal nouns
-     adverbial clauses (which are formally marked as noun phrases)None of these are ever obligatory, i.e. part of the argument structure of a verb.
They provide additional information about time, place, direction, manner, or
cause.
                                                    9.10. Constituent order   3679.10.4.    Position of adverbsItems which can function as adverbs are either from a subset of adjectives or
adverbs proper. The latter can never modify a noun attributively like
adjectives and constitute a word class of their own.
    Semantically, adjectives with adverbial function and most adverbs proper
specify the manner of carrying out the action denoted by the verb. Some
adverbs proper have a temporal meaning. On adjectives which can or cannot
be used adverbially, see 3.4. On adverbs proper, see 3.6.
    In addition, directionals can also be used adverbially indicating that a
movement event specified by a verb of motion takes place in a certain
direction. On directionals, see 3.8 (as word class), 9.1.1 (modifying
intransitive verbs of motion) and 9.1.2 (as intransitive verbs of motion).
    Generally, adverbs (104), adjectives with adverbial function (105), and
directionals (106) occur immediately before the verbs they modify:(104) heb        ke-n-al=e!
      quickly    do-REAL-2SG.HORT=HORT
      ‘Hurry!’ [Danenok](105) tn     gwáab=e         sm me-b-e=be

      ‘The Telefomin people came down and then …’ [Mianmin and
      Telefomin]While adverbial directionals, adverbial adjectives and some adverbs are
restricted to the position immediately before the verb, some adverbs show
some mobility within the clause. This is illustrated for imín~eimín ‘again’ in
pre-verbal position (107) and in clause-initial position (108):(107) imensan=o               imin      ol-êb

9.10.1.     Argument order in transitive clausesAll overtly realized arguments are either free pronouns or full noun phrases.
Rarely, both subject and object are overtly realized as free pronouns. In such
cases, the subject always precedes the object. This is independent of whether
the object is indexed on the verb with prefix (89) or a suffix (90):(89)      n                    ya-têm’-Ø-i=bo

       ‘we left you and then someone else…’ [Crows]If the arguments are instantiated by full noun phrases instead of pronouns, the
unmarked constituent order is AOV. Overt subject noun phrases usually
precede object noun phrases. This order is very consistently observed in
elicited examples, e.g.:(91)   naka=e      unáng=o             wa-têm’-Ø-e=be
       man=SG.M woman=SG.F             3SG.F.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man saw the woman.’In natural discourse, however, relative order of subject and object noun
phrases is less consistently A followed by O. This usually does not create
ambiguities due to the language’s head-marking characteristics, which in most
cases allow the identification of syntactic relations through information from
the pronominal and classificatory affixes without having to take constituent
order information into account. Deviation from the unmarked order in natural
discourse will be discussed in 9.10.1 below.
    Although unmarked constituent order in Mian is AOV, verb-final position
is really all that is mandated. Hence, it is possible to invert subject and object
if both grammatical relations are realized by overt noun phrases.
    In many cases, argument indexing disambiguates as in example (92) where
the pronominal affixes -e and wa- clearly indicate that the man is the ‘seer’
and the woman the ‘seen’:(92)   unáng=o        naka=e     wa-têm’-Ø-e=be
       woman=SG.F man=SG.M 3SG.F.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man has seen the woman.’A natural example is (93) where argument indexing on the verb indicates who
leads whom. Preposed objects are typically topics and marked with the topic
clitic =le:(93)   memé         =le             Sobining=e

       ‘As for the children, Sobining took them and then ...’ [Sobining]
364       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseI analyse examples like (93) as topicalizations rather than cleft structures
because there are no cues that suggest the latter analysis, such as presence of a
copula or an obvious bi-clausal structure.
   Argument inversion is not possible with pronominal subjects without topic
marking of the object. Compare (94) and (95):(94)      imen =le                n      wen-b-i=be
          taro     SG.N1=TOP       1SG eat.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘As for the taro, I’m eating (it).’(95)      *imen=e         n      wen-b-i=be
          taro=SG.N1      1SG eat.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          Intended: ‘I’m eating the taro.’This restriction is independent of whether the verb marks the object or not.
Thus, (96) is bad as well.(96)      *naka=e         n     a-têm’-Ø-i=be

          Intended: ‘I’ve seen the man.’I will mention here in passing that in (core-level) serial verb constructions,
overt object noun phrases can appear inside the verb serialization, if they are
exclusive to one of the verbs in the chain:(97)      dabáal=e            haka           dam=o

buried her’ not of haka ‘break’. For details, see section 11.1.1.3 on serial verb

10.2.     Content questionsIn content questions, the speaker requests information about some participant,
theme, location, time, manner, etc. of an event or action. The proposition of a
content question is presupposed apart from the queried constituent.
   Content questions are formed with the interrogative clitic =e (=ne after
vowel). It encliticizes to the (clause-final) finite verb or the interrogative
phrase. Content questions are never marked by the interrogative particle m.
   Apart from being flagged with the interrogative clitic =e, content questions
also involve one of the two basic question words or interrogative words fàb
‘where’ (18) or wan ‘who’ (19), which have further semantic extensions into
other epistemic domains (see below):(18)    fàb      un-Ø-eb=e?
        where    go.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=CQ
        ‘Where do you go?’(19)    wan-ta                   kàb      le

        smash.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=CQ
        ‘Who’s broken this cup?’ [TMA questionnaire, 127]Semantically, the two interrogative words almost exactly divide the world up
into animates (wan ‘who’), on the one hand, and inanimates and adverbials
(fàb ‘where, what’), on the other. The only exception to this rule is that wan
plus emphatic pronoun is employed to find out about people’s names, which
are not strictly animate but nonetheless important properties of people.
                                                     10.2. Content questions   391    The interrogative words fàb and wan neither encode number nor gender.
Emphatic pronouns, which can be compounded with both fàb and wan, have
to encode number and in the third person singular also gender. Mian
interrogative words do not overlap with relative pronouns and they are
semantically unambiguous, i.e. they do not have alternative interpretations as
indefinites, as interrogatives do for example in Japanese (Nichigauchi 1990)
or in the Australian languages Kayardild (Evans 1995: 365) and Kuuk
Thaayorre (Gaby 2006: 243-244). Both fàb and wan can be used pronominally
and adnominally.
    Content questions in Mian usually have declarative (i.e. falling) intonation,
but can be intonationally marked by a quick rise and subsequent fall of pitch
on the last syllable of the utterance, whose nucleus is invariably formed by the
illocutionary particle. This intonational pattern is very similar to the one found
in polar questions.
    The interrogative clitic =e can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to indicate that the speaker assumes that the addressee wants this action
to be performed by the speaker (or by a group to which both speaker and
addressee belong), e.g.:(20)      fàb      o-fâ-n-an=e?
          where    3SG.RESID.O-put.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ.HORT =CQ
          ‘Where shall I put it?’ [Observed]Interrogative phrases, which contain the interrogative words fàb and wan,
always appear in situ, i.e. they occur in the same position as non-interrogative
phrases with the same grammatical function (Li and Thompson 1984: 51,
Dryer 2005).
   As in polar and alternative questions, constituent order is not changed with
respect to the corresponding declarative sentence and the interrogative phrase
occupies the position which the queried constituent would have in an
appropriate answer sentence.
   There are a few cases where the interrogative phrase seems to be not in situ
but rather to be postposed after the verb. I will turn to this issue in more detail
below.","[416, 417]"

13.3.5.     Other markers of head-internal relative clausesSo far the discussion has been confined to articles as markers of head-internal
relative clauses. But like non-relativized noun phrases, head-internal relative
clauses can take a whole range of pronominal elements, such as:-     Distal demonstrative: y/y/yi
-     Proximal demonstrative: le/lo/li
-     Emphatic pronoun: ta/ta/ta
-     Emphatic proximal demonstrative: leta/lota/lita
-     Emphatic distal demonstrative: yta/yta/yitaOn emphatic pronouns, see 3.7.4. On demonstratives, see 3.7.9.
  Instead of an article, the distal demonstratives y/y/yi can be used to
mark a head-internal relative clause:(62)      tubáan=a                blon        áan=o            bubbub=a
          chest_feather=and       wing_bone    feather=PL.N1    down=and          y       bi-Ø-o=yo

          ‘(both) the chest feathers and the downs of the wing feathers which
          were there’ [Crows]An example of the animate plural form of the distal demonstrative yi is given
in (63):(63)      naka=obba       y        aaie

the emphatic pronoun (65), and the emphatic distal demonstrative (66) as
markers of head-internal relative clauses:(64)      kbo       senso=e

          3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-1SG.R=HORT
          ‘Give me just that book you’re reading!’Determiners marking the head-internal relative clause tend to encliticize to the
relative clause verb. This tendency is especially pronounced if the verb ends
and the pronoun starts in segmentally like vowels, as in (67):(67)      naka=e         balubib=y
          man=SG.M       airstrip=at          mâa’-bi-Ø-e=le
          stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DEM.PROX.SG.M
          ‘this man who is standing at the airstrip’
13.3.6.    Complex head-internal relative clauses and switch referenceHead-internal relative clauses themselves can be complex insofar as they can
be a clause chaining construction consisting of at least one medial clause and
one final clause. Although there should be no theoretical limit to the number
510    13. Embeddingof medial clauses, complex head-internal relatives maximally consist of one
medial and one final clause in my corpus. The rarity of chained relative
clauses in general and of long ones (those which have more than one medial
clause) in particular is probably attributable to processing constraints.
Likewise, it is no wonder that complex prenominal relative clauses are not
attested at all. Processing issues due to the length of relative clauses are more
pronounced here because the hearer has to process the whole relative clause
before being able to identify the head noun, which follows the prenominal
relative clause.
    In complex chained head-internal relative clauses, the medial clause has a
medial verb and the verb in the last clause is final. In this respect, chained
relative clauses are no different from clause-chaining constructions in general.
However, unlike independent sentences which consist of a clause chain, the
final verb in a chained relative clause does not take an illocutionary clitic but
rather a determiner which marks the whole relative clause as a noun phrase:(68)   Afueiwok=o       Dimobib=wt      daa-n-o=a
       PN=SG.F          PN=across        dwell.PFV-SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED       te-s-u=o

       ‘Afueiwok, who dwelled across in Dimobib and came (a long time
       ago)’ [Afueiwok]In terms of marking S/R and event sequentiality or simultaneity, medial verbs
in chained relative clauses behave exactly like medial verbs in non-embedded
clause chains. S/R morphology provides a nifty mechanism to anticipate a
change of the grammatical relation the head noun has with respect to the verb
in the succeeding clause. Consider example (69):(69)   nakamín=e       tosiana

13.3.7.     An analytical issue in head-internal relative clausesSo far I have been assuming without justification that head-internal relatives
are clauses. It is now time to justify this assumption. Consider (70):(70)      naka=i         balubib=y
          man=PL.AN      airstrip=at          mâa’-bl-Ø-ib
          stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ          li
          DEM.PROX.PL.AN
          ‘these men who are standing at the airstrip’Now, it is not necessarily straightforward that an expression, such as in (70),
should be analysed as one clause with an overt subject noun phrase naka=i as
opposed to another theoretically possible analysis which breaks this
expression down into a nominal head nakai and an embedded postnominal
relative clause balubib y mâa’blib li.
    There is prosodic and syntactic evidence that (70) is indeed a full clause
and not a head noun followed by a postnominal relative clause. Prosodically,
the whole string is one intonational unit, set off from the rest of the matrix
clause by a short pause. Hence, phonological evidence points towards an
analysis of head-internal relatives as single clauses.
    Syntactic evidence comes from the simple fact that any head-internal
relative clause can have the constituent order which one would expect if they
were independent declarative sentences. Consider the following two head-
internal relative clauses in (71) and (72):(71)      [naka=i] SBJ          y
          man=PL.AN             there          mâa’-bl-Ø-ib=i

       DEM.PROX.PL.AN
       ‘these two marsupials which the man is carrying on his arm’
       [Mammals and insects]Not only do head-internal relative clauses display regular clausal syntax, i.e.
SV in intransitive clauses (71) and AOV in transitive ones (72), but the latter
example shows especially well that the head noun, here being the object,
occurs in its normal position within the clause and that it is not the case that
the head noun is followed by a postnominal relative clause.
   Further evidence against an analysis which assumes postnominal relative
clauses comes from chained relative clauses with different overt subject noun
phrases. Consider (73):(73)   imak-wal        bl-Ø-ib=a                               nakamîn-wal
       husband-PL      stay.IPFV-DS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED       man-PL       bl-Ø-ib=i

       say.PFV-DS.SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
       ‘they (the Telefol women) told the(ir) husbands and brothers who
       were there (at home) and then the brothers and husbands…’
       [Mianmin and Telefomin]In the face of this example, it would be very difficult to argue that the
utterance imak-wal bliba nakamîn-wal blibi is anything but a chain of two
clauses each with its own overt subject noun phrase, where the first clause has
a medial verb (bliba) and the second a final verb (blib) with the article =i.
Although chained clauses with medial verbs are dependent on the final verb in
the last clause of the chain regarding certain morphosyntactic information,
clause chains are essentially coordinate and not subordinate or embedded
structures.
    There are, however, cases which prima facie conflict with the analysis that
head-internal relative clauses are single clauses rather than a head noun
                                                     13.3. Relative clauses   513followed by a postnominal relative clause. If the object is relativized and the
subject is overtly realized as a pronoun, the only attested word order is:(74)   naka=e       n      a-têm’-Ø-i=e
       man=SG.M     1SG 3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=SG.M
       ‘the man whom I saw’This case provides problematic evidence because the constituent order OAV,
which we find in (74) is not possible in independent sentences, if the subject is
a free (non-emphatic) pronoun. Compare (75) and (76):(75)   naka=e          n-ta          a-têm’-Ø-i=be
       man=SG.M        1SG-EMPH       3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I (i.e. not you) saw the man.’(76)   *nakae n atêm’ibe
       Intended: ‘I saw the man.’So we have to conclude that should we want to analyse (74) as a head-internal
relative clause, it would not conform to normal clausal syntax. There are two
ways out of this situation.
    First, one could assume embedding for this special case and say that in
(74) a nominal antecedent naka=e is followed by an embedded postnominal
relative clause n a-têm’-Ø-i=e. Clearly this is unsatisfactory because (a)
under such an analysis only examples like (74) would involve embedding
whereas for all other cases there is no evidence for a postnominal embedded
relative clause at all. Such a solution makes the analysis of head-internal
relatives unnecessarily complicated. After all, head-internal relative clauses,
whether they conform to basic constituent order in declarative sentences or
whether they are deviant in that respect, are formally marked in the same way.
    The second option is to assume that head-internal relative clauses are
single clauses, the corollary being that they can differ from simple declarative
sentences in that they are allowed to display a constituent order unattested in
simple declarative sentences.
    This is clearly the way to go in the analysis of Mian. In discussing head-
internal relatives (which he calls “zirkumnominal”, i.e. circum-nominal),
Lehmann (1984) proposes a distinction between a variant with a stationary
nucleus (i.e. unbewegter Nucleus) as opposed to a variant with a preposed
nucleus (i.e. vorangestellter Nucleus). On the issue of the head position in
head-internal relative clauses also see Basilico (1996). Languages which have
head-internal relative clauses can show both variants. Diegueño, for example,
usually has stationary nuclei but allows preposed ones as a secondary strategy
514   13. Embedding(Gorbet 1973). We find a similar situation in Mian. Stationary nuclei are the
norm but under special circumstances when an overt pronoun is involved and
the object is relativized, as in example (74) above, the preposed-nucleus
strategy is consistently chosen.

Texts
This is a collection of three texts. The first two are traditional narratives which
are about the origin of a certain fruit and a certain type of arrow, respectively.
The third text is procedural. In this text the narrator tells about how he is
rolling a smoke. All three texts follow that orthographic conventions
established in chapter 2.9. Each sentence or clause in a clause chain has a
separate number.","[534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541]"

9.7.      Possessor raisingPossessor raising is a valency-increasing process through which a possessor is
promoted to object status. In Mian, possessors can be expressed by recipient
suffixes on -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ compounded with the main verb in the
perfective. In the imperfective affixation is directly to the stem.
   Possessor raising is commonly found with body parts, but not restricted to
these (see below). If the verb is transitive (after possessor raising), the body
part is indexed on the verb as the subject. Consider the following example of
sikà’ ‘swell (IPFV)’, repeated from (49) above:(68)    yle     kenéng
        well,    cheek        sikà’-ye-biaan-o=a
        swell.IPFV-PL.AN.R-AUX.IPFV.SS.SIM-3PL.N1.SBJ=MED
        ‘well, their cheeks were swelling up’ [Sofelok 2]Possessor raising is also attested with body wastes:(69)    al=o               méb
        faeces=PL.N1       close        tl-ûb’-a-s-o=ta
        come.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-DS.SEQ-3PL.N1.SBJ=MED
        ‘he had to defecate and then he …’ (lit. his faeces came
        close) [Danenok]If the verb is ditransitive (after possessor raising), the body part is the object,
as in (70). Recall that not all transitive verbs mark their object with a
pronominal or classificatory prefix:(70)    bnon=e
        arm_bone=SG.N1        hel-ût’-ne-n-e=be
        break_across.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He’s broken my arm.’
358    9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseThere is a restriction that the pronominal affixes cross-referencing subject and
any object must not co-referent. In reflexive situations, the object marker on
the verb cannot reflexively refer to the endpoint of a reflexive action (see 9.9
on reflexivization). Likewise, raising of a possessor to object status is
impossible if the subject is identical to the possessor of the body part. Hence,
possessor raising is disallowed in (71):(71)   bnon=e             helâ-Ø-i-o=be

       ‘I’ve broken my arm (intentionally or unintentionally).’Mian has extended the possibility for possessor raising from body parts to all
possessed items. Any animate possessor can be raised to argument status, as in
(72) and (73):(72)   nakamîn=e         imen=o           éil=e

       ‘Who broke off (some of) my sugarcane?’ [Unangkliten]The next example illustrates possessor raising with a transitive verb, which
obligatorily indexes its object with a pronominal prefix, e.g. -nâ’ ‘kill (PFV)’:(74)   n     tíl=o          wa-nâ’-ût’-ne-n-e

       ‘I don’t know the man who killed my bitch.’Apart from the object suffix, the possessor can be encoded with an optional
possessive pronoun preceding the possessed, as in (75):

       ‘(You should) Mark my words!’
9.8.     Impersonal verbsA few verbs which signify the arrival of the morning, the evening or the night,
or express that some time has passed invariably have -o in the position of the
subject suffix. However, they can never occur with an overt subject noun
phrase which this -o would cross-reference. Therefore, I treat these verbs as
impersonal and analyse -o as an expletive subject marker. Impersonal verbs
have zero-valency. They cannot undergo derivation to increase their valency.
Semantically, they are zero-place predications, similar to expletive
constructions in Indo-European languages, such as English ‘it’s raining’. Two
examples are given below:(76)   bomâ-s-o=to                       yole    

9.9.     ReflexivizationReflexivization is an infrequent phenomenon in Mian discourse. Therefore,
this section is more about what cannot be expressed reflexively than about
what can.
360    9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause   The most common way of describing a reflexive situation is to replace the
object of a transitive verb with a reflexive pronoun. Compare (78) and (79):(78)   naka=e         aal=e               gò’-n-e=be
       man=SG.M       skin=SG.N1          cut_skin.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man has cut the skin.’(79)   naka=e        -maye              gò’-n-e=be
       man=SG.M      3SG.M-REFL          cut_skin.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man has cut himself.’Reflexivization works productively with some transitive verbs, namely only
those which denote a physical action towards the self. The pronoun in (80) can
only have an emphatic but not a reflexive reading:(80)   naka=e            -maye
       man=SG.M          3SG.M-REFL       kimâa’-bi-Ø-e=be
       care_for.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man himself is caring for (someone).’
       *‘The man is caring for himself.’Mian does not have any lexically reflexive verbs, for which the reflexive
reading would be entailed. All grooming verbs are transitive and require an
object which refers to the affected body part:(81)   naka=e            mináan=o
       man=SG.M          whisker=PL.N1       deilâ’-n-e=be
       remove_hair.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man has removed his whiskers.’ (i.e. ‘the man has shaved’)The most frequent grooming verb (aaie) fuela/(aaie) fua ‘bathe’ is a noun-
verb idiom (see 8.10). It is interpreted as reflexive in its intransitive form, as
in (82):(82)   naka=e         aaie     fua-b-e=be
       man=SG.M       water bathe.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man is bathing (himself).’
                                                       9.9. Reflexivization   361A transitive verb (aaie) fuela-/(aaie) fua- ‘bathe somebody’ can be derived
from the intransitive base. However, a reflexive reading is never possible for
the derived form:(83)   kbo
       2SG.M       aaie     fuela-ˆt’-ne-n-al=e!
       water    bathe.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-2SG.SBJ.HORT=HORT
       ‘(You should) Bathe me!’Although many transitive verbs that obligatorily index their objects with a
pronominal or a classificatory prefix denote concrete physical actions, none
can actually be used reflexively by having co-referent subject and object
markers. This is simply not permitted by the grammar. For these verbs, e.g.
-têm’ ‘see (PFV)’, the object prefix must never be co-referent with the subject
suffix. Hence, (84) is fine, (85) can only have a disjoint reading and (86) is
ungrammatical and does not have any meaning:(84)   a-têm’-Ø-i=be
       3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I saw him.’(85)   a-têm’-Ø-e=be
       3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘Hek saw himl.’
       BUT: *‘He saw himself.’(86)   *na-têm’-Ø-i=be
       1SG.O-see.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       Intended: ‘I saw myself.’Apart from this systematic grammatical restriction, there are semantic and also
cultural reasons which militate against reflexivization. Consider the transitive
verbs -fû’/— ‘grab’ and -nâ’/— ‘hit, kill’. While one can grab or hold other
people, it is less clear how one would grab oneself and self-hitting and suicide
are not part of Mianmin culture.
   However, to “see oneself” is both semantically plausible and culturally
appropriate. In former times the only surface which reflected properly was
water. Hence one used to say and in fact still says today:

          ‘The man is looking at his (water-)reflection.’Although there are mirrors nowadays and the noun aakikit is actually used to
refer to mirrors, one still cannot “see oneself” in Mian. An alternative to (87)
is (88):(88)                kibi=o       wa-temê’-b-e=be
          3SG.M      face=N2      N2.O-see.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
          ‘He’s looking at his face (implied: in the mirror).’
9.10.       Constituent orderThis section deals with the order of constituents in the clause. There are no
differences in constituent order possibilities between medial clauses, on the
one hand, and final clauses or independent sentences, on the other. The only
clause type which can show an order of constituents not attested in any other
clause type is the head-internal relative clause (see 13.3.7).
    I will first describe the unmarked order of overtly realized argument noun
phrases (which is S/A followed by O) and then discuss deviations from it.
    Finally, the position of different types of adverbs and adverbial adjuncts in
the clause will be discussed.","[383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388]"

with the function verb ke ‘do’ to express that a group consists of a certain

further inflection for general past (-bio), hesternal past (-so), in (223), and

noun adjunct followed by a verb. The semantic relation can be opaque. Noun-
verb idioms are for example:(225) aaie fuela/aaie fua     [water bathe]             ‘bathe’
      abén gi/ abén gila      [laughter laugh]          ‘laugh’
      tamaan kou              [fornication copulate]    ‘fornicate, rape’
      usáan fu                [vomit cook]              ‘vomit’
      fètang kun              [carrion_smell smell]     ‘smell putrid’
      tamamèin klâ            [shock fix]               ‘be frightened’
      mma taa                [spittle spit]            ‘spit’What all of these have in common is that the noun preceding the verb
functions as an adjunct and not as an object. It does not have argument status.
Nominal adjuncts are highly restricted in their syntax. They have to
immediately precede the verb and cannot be modified with a relative clause.
Objects on the other hand can be fronted and modified with a relative clause.
   Within the noun-verb type of idiom, two cases have to be distinguished: (a)
the nominal adjunct can be omitted without a difference in meaning and (b)
omission of the adjunct results in a semantic change.
   An example of the first type is aaie fuela/aaie fua ‘bathe’, which still
means ‘bathe’ when aaie ‘the water’ is omitted:(226) fua-biaan-ib=to
      bathe.IPFV-AUX.IPFV.SS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
      ‘while they were bathing, they…’ [Sobining]With the second type, the adjunct cannot be omitted without affecting the
semantics. Compare:(227) kou-we-b-e=a
      have_sex-3SG.F.R-DS.SIM-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
      ‘while he was having sex with her, she…’ [Newlyweds](228) tamaan=o          kou-ye-b-ib=ta
      fornication=N2 have_sex-PL.AN.R-DS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
      ‘while they were raping them, …’ [Mianmin and Telefomin]
328     8. Verb morphology8.11.     The ‘Immediate action’ constructionMian has a special construction for immediate actions involving the function
verb ge/ga~gena ‘say’. It is used to express that the speaker desires or intends
to perform an action immediately after the moment of speaking or that an
event is about happen. In contrast to the coverb-function verb construction
with ge/ga ‘say’ (see 8.9 above), the imperfective stem gena is preferred over
ga in the immediate action construction, e.g.:(229) fút=e                  gíng=e
      tobacco=SG.N1          midrib=SG.N1        tob-tlâa’-n-ang-gena-b-i=be
        3SG.LONG.O-remove.PFV-REAL-IMMACT.NANPL.SBJ-say.IPFV-IPFV-
        1SG.SBJ=DECL
        ‘I’m about to remove the midrib of the tobacco leaf.’ [Rolling smokes]Apart from the suffix -ang ‘Immediate action (not animate plural subject)’ for
singular subjects, there is also -om ‘Immediate action (animate plural subject)’
for animate plural subjects. The latter suffix sometimes assimilates to the
following velar // and is realized as -ong:(230) un-om-ge-n-ob=a
      go.PFV-IMMACT.AN.PL.SBJ-say.PFV-SEQ-1PL.SBJ=MED
      ‘we wanted to go and then…’ [Ala ritual]Instead of the imperfective stem of the function verb gena~ga ‘say’ inflected
with -b ‘Imperfective’ one also finds the inchoative verb form with
-m in the same construction. There is no obvious difference in meaning, e.g.:(231) eka       imak=e             ybbaka
      and       husband=SG.M       as_well        dob-Øˆ-ang-gena-m-e
        3SG.M_CL.O-take.PFV-IMMACT.NANPL.SBJ-say.IPFV-INCH-3SG.N1.SBJ        kesoa
        because
        ‘because it (the water) was about to take the husband as well, …’
        [Flood]
                                  8.11. The ‘Immediate action’ construction   329The ‘Immediate action’-construction is very likely a reanalysis of an
embedded quotative construction (see 13.1). The erstwhile hortative suffixes
-an ‘1SG.HORT’ and -om ‘1PL.HORT’ are still discernible (see 8.6.8 on subject
marking in hortative forms). Compare (229) above to the following example
(232), which is also attested in synchronic Mian. The embedded hortative
sentence is given in brackets:(232) [fút=e                gíng=e
      tobacco=SG.N1         midrib=SG.N1       tob-tlâa’-n-an=o]
       3SG.LONG.O-remove.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ.HORT=HORT       gena-b-i=be
       say.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I think I should remove the midrib of the tobacco leaf.’There are several reasons why I set up ‘Immediate action’ as a distinct
construction. Speaker intuitions about word boundaries indicate that
tobtlâa’nanggenabibe ‘I am about to remove a long object’ as one word, while
tobtlâa’nano genabibe ‘I think I should remove a long object’ is judged to be
two separate words. This speaker judgment is supported by the fact that the
hortative subject suffix -an has assimilated to the following /g/ of ge/ga~gena
‘say’ and is always realized as -ang in the immediate action construction.
   More important, however, is that the former behaves like a single
phonological word (with one accent and one tonal melody), while the latter
consists of two separate phonological words.
   Morphologically, in embedded hortatives the subjects in the embedded and
the matrix clause can vary independently of each other, whereas this is not
possible in the ‘Immediate action’-construction. The identity of the immediate
action suffix is entirely predictable from the number and animacy of the
subject of the matrix verb. If the subject is singular, -ang is used, if it is
animate plural -om ~ -ong.
   Finally, the construction for immediate actions allows inanimate subjects,
e.g. the water in (229) above, while quotative constructions (whether
declarative, interrogative, or hortative) are restricted to subjects which have a
consciousness and are capable of intentional action.
Chapter 9
Argument structure and the syntax of the clause
9.0.        IntroductionThis chapter deals with the argument structure of the verb and with the order
of constituents in the clause. The unmarked constituent orders in Mian are SV
in intransitive clauses and AOV in transitive clauses. While the verb is almost
always final in any clause (a marginal exception will be dealt with in 11.2.10),
the order of core arguments and adverbial adjuncts is less rigidly fixed.
    This chapter also contains sections on non-verbal clauses, reciprocals and a
note on causatives.
    Mian is head-marking at clause level (Nichols 1996). There is no
morphological case or adpositional marking for core grammatical relations.
Rather relevant syntactic relations are marked on the verb. Most arguments in
the clause, i.e. subjects, recipients, and for some verbs also the object, are
indexed on the verb by affixes.
    Mian has intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, ambitransitive, and
impersonal (or atransitive) verbs. Compounding with -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ with a
quasi-applicative function is used as a valency-increasing device in the
perfective to derive transitives from intransitives and ditransitives from
transitives in a highly productive way. In the imperfective, recipient suffixes
are directly appended to a verb to increase its valency.
    The only clearly underived ditransitive verb in Mian is -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’.
Underived ditransitives show triple agreement, i.e. they index the subject, the
object (the gift) and the recipient with an affix (see section 9.5 on
ditransitives).
    Ambitransitive verbs (Dixon 1994, 2002) can be used intransitively or
transitively without any derivational process.
    There are also a few impersonal verbs with an expletive subject marker,
which denote the arrival of morning and afternoon and the passage of time.
    All finite verbs must contain a subject suffix indexing the subject of the
verb, which in the rare case of impersonal verbs is an expletive (-o). This form
is homophonous to the third person singular feminine subject marker.
    I define the argument structures as follows:-      Intransitives have exactly one core argument (S).
-      Transitives have exactly two core arguments (both A and O).
-      Ditransitives have exactly three core arguments (A, O and R).
332      9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause-      Ambitransitives have either one (S) or two core arguments (both A and
       O).
-      Atransitives (impersonal verbs) have no core arguments.","[351, 352, 353, 354, 355, 356, 357, 358]"
"This is illustrated for -dum ‘with’ (41) and -dofa ‘about’ (42):

nominal postposition dim ‘on’, yielding fatnàmin dim ta ‘when’, which is
formally a postpositional phrase (see section 7.2 on nominal postpositions like
dim ‘on’ and 7.5 on temporal postpositional phrases):(43)      fatnàmin   dim   -ta          tl-Ø-eb-bu=e?
          what       on    N2-EMPH       come.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ-GPST=CQ
          ‘When did you come?’
10.2.7.     The interrogative word wanThe interrogative word wan ‘who’ is used to inquire about the identity of
animates including their names.
   There are four variants wan, un and wal, ul. The variation between /wa/
and /u/ is free and can be found in other areas of Mian grammar, e.g. in the
variation of the object agreement prefix wa- ~ u- (see 8.5.3). The variants wal
and ul have the morphophonemic variants wale and ule if the following
emphatic pronoun start in /i/, there is. Thus, the forms for the second and third
person plural are walibta/ulibta ‘who (you PL)’ and walita/ulita ‘who
(they)’, respectively.
   Without an emphatic pronoun, wan only occurs in questions about
possessors. Like possessors expressed by full noun phrases, the interrogative
word wan precedes the possessed. Either the pronominal article =e in the
singular masculine form (44) or =i in the animate plural form (45) is
obligatory:
                                                     10.2. Content questions   399(44)    le                wan=e                 tíl=e?

        ‘Whose (man’s) dog is this?’(45)    le                 wan=i                tíl=e?
        DEM.PROX.SG.M       who=PL.AN            dog=CQ
        ‘Whose (people’s) dog is this?’In questions about the identity of a certain individual wan ‘who’ has to be
compounded with an emphatic pronoun, such as ta ‘he (EMPH)’ (see 3.7.4).
The interrogative clitic =e is used to mark interrogative illocution. When =e
follows the pronoun suffix -ta, this suffix is realized as -t, as in (46) and (47):(46)    bo    wan-bt=e?
        2PL    who-2PL.AN.EMPH=CQ
        ‘Who are you (PL)?’(47)    unáng      lo                   wan-t=e?
        woman      DEM.PROX.SG.F         who-3SG.F.EMPH=CQ
        ‘Who is this woman?’In questions about arguments in a clause, wan ‘who’ is compounded with an
emphatic pronoun and occurs in situ. In (48) and (49) the subject is being
queried:(48)    blaya     ul-ta                    kwéit
        damn      who-3SG.M.EMPH            sugarcane        hal-ût’-ne-n-e-bu=e?

        build.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ-GPST=CQ
        ‘Who built this house?’ [TMA Questionnaire, 128]So far, all instances of wan have been to inquire about the possessor or the
subject. It is also possible to use wan to inquire about the object of a transitive
verb:
400    10. Question formation(50)   wan-ta              a-temê’-b-eb=e?
       who-SG.M.EMPH        3SG.M.O-see.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=CQ
       ‘Who are you looking at?’In ditransitives, content questions about either the recipient (51) or the theme
(52) are possible, but not both in the same clause. The maximal number of
queried constituents is restricted to one:(51)   buk=o         wan-ta
       book=N2       who-SG.M.EMPH       om-ûb’-a-n-eb=e?
       3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-REAL-2SG.SBJ=CQ
       ‘To whom did you give the book?’(52)   naka=e         fatnàmin
       man=SG.M       what        dl-ûb’-a-n-eb=e?
       PL.AN.O-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-REAL-2SG.SBJ=CQ
       ‘What did you give to the man?’The use of the classificatory prefix dl- ‘plural animate object’ in the last
example does not entail that the referent of the object is animate and plural.
Rather it is used as a default form in content questions about the object, i.e.
when the identity of the object referent is unknown and queried. For inquiring
about inanimate objects, see section 10.2.4 on fatnàmin ‘what’ above.
   The combination wan ‘who’ plus emphatic pronoun is used in a non-verbal
construction to inquire about proper names, which are important properties of
humans and some animals. Example (53) is the idiomatic way of inquiring
about a man’s name. To ask about a woman’s name wanbte has to be used.(53)   kb              ninín=o=le       wan-kbt=e?
       2SG.M.POSS       name=N2=TOP      who-2SG.M.EMPH=CQ
       ‘What is your (M) name?’ (lit. ‘As for your (M) name, who
       [are] you (M)?’)Like fàb ‘where’, the interrogative word wan plus an emphatic pronoun can
also be used adnominally as an interrogative modifier. In adnominal position it
means ‘which’:
                                                  10.2. Content questions   401(54)   naka=i          wan-ta

       come.PFV-DEONT-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=CQ
       ‘Which men are about to come?’ [Danenok]There is one case where the interrogative phrase seemingly does not appear in
situ. Consider the two semantically more or less equivalent utterances. In both
(55) and (56), the speaker wants to know who broke the cup (|| indicates an
intonational break):(55)   wan-ta                kàb         le
       who-3SG.M.EMPH         cup(TP)     DEM.PROX.SG.N1       klutâ-n-e=ne?
       smash-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=CQ
       ‘Who smashed this cup?’ [TMA questionnaire, alternative for 127](56)   kàb=e              klutâ-n-e                   =le           ||

       who-3SG.M.EMPH=CQ
       ‘(As for) He who broke the cup, who (is he)?’ [TMA questionnaire,
       127]Compare constituent order in these two examples and also consider the order
in the possible declarative answer in (57), which is parallel in structure to
example (55):(57)   Milsen=e     kàb=e               klutâ-n-e=be
       PN=SG.M      cup(TP)=SG.N1       smash.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=CQ
       ‘Milsen has smashed the cup.’Example (55) above consists of one clause showing the unmarked AOV order.
The interrogative phrase is in subject position (i.e. in situ) and the verb is
marked for interrogative illocution, whereas (56), on the other hand, does not
consist of a finite clause but rather of a topic-comment construction with a
head-internal relative clause in topic position, namely kàb=e klutâ-n-e =le
‘he who broke the cup’, which is marked as a topic with =le, followed by a
juxtaposed comment consisting of the interrogative word and the illocutionary
402       10. Question formationclitic, set off from the relative clause in topic position by a short intonational
break. On head-internal relative clauses, see 13.3.2.","[423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428]"

Acknowledgements
The present volume is the heavily revised version of my doctoral dissertation
“A grammar of Mian, a Papuan language of New Guinea”. It is wider in scope
and also tries to get rid of the rough edges of the dissertation. Since my days
as a Ph.D. student I have been back to the field for two more months
expanding the corpus and tying up loose ends in the analysis. This larger
corpus, the critical and helpful comments of the external reviewers, as well as
two years of turning over various issues of Mian grammar in my mind, helped
me to develop a clearer view of many of these issues. I would like to sincerely
thank the following people and institutions for providing help and support
during my Ph.D. and while revising the material and preparing it for
publication. All mistakes are, of course, my own.
    A great debt of gratitude is owed to the people of the Mianmin
communities in Mianmin and Yapsiei for sharing their language, culture and
lives with me during my stay in Papua New Guinea. In particular, thanks to
the whole Milimab family, especially to Kasening Milimab, for great patience
and interest in this project and for taking me in as one of the family.
    Special thanks go to my language consultants: Kasening Milimab, who had
an immense knowledge and was very concerned that I learn Mian properly,
Asuneng Amit, who had the gift of telling wonderful stories and the patience
for paradigm elicitation, Liden Milimab, whose superb command of English
was helpful in many ways, and Raymond Davai, who taught me basic Mian
tonology by indicating pitch movements with hand gestures, after it had turned
out that the method of having speakers whistle the tones failed. Thanks also to
Beitab Fenobi and Ibalim Soubgena, from whom I was able to record
historical accounts and descriptions of traditional Mianmin initiation rituals
and to Umsin Milimab, Wentak Yung, Awaseb Oblib, Ms. Selem Kasening,
Milsen (aka Mandat) Milimab, Eron Yung, Davai Milimab, Wils Tloniab,
Stanley Ebtem, Headmaster Nontlin Dab, Ray Waniab from MAF in Tabubil,
Jeremiah (aka Vagi) Yung, Ebel Yangsin, Aiben, and the pastors Uneyab and
Maikas.
    I am grateful to my supervisors Nick Evans and Rachel Nordlinger for
steady guidance and support throughout the Ph.D. project.
    Thanks to Nick for always challenging me intellectually in our supervision
meetings, for never being satisfied with the second best, but also for steady
encouragement along the way. He not only made me be critical towards my
work and sharpen my analyses of Mian linguistic structure but also made me
aware how important it is to have the reader in mind when writing a grammar.
vi   AcknowledgementsThanks also for many valuable tips concerning fieldwork and equipment
(especially the ‘dead-dog’ bag to keep things dry).
    Thanks to Rachel, who was always there for spontaneous meetings, in
which we discussed various topics of my thesis and brought some sense into
the complex Mian verb morphology. Also for being a great moral support
throughout the time of my Ph.D.
    I thank the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen for
enabling me to continue my work on this grammar while being a postdoc in
the Language and Cognition Group, and the Arts and Humanities Research
Council (UK) for giving me the opportunity to continue my work and finish
this grammar while working on the ESF EuroBabel project “Alor-Pantar
languages: origin and theoretical impact” (AH/H500251/1).
    The fieldwork I have conducted during my time as a Ph.D. student (in 2004
and 2005) was funded by the Arts Faculty of the University of Melbourne and
the ARC Discovery Project “Reciprocals across languages”. The last field trip
(in 2008) was funded by the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics in
Nijmegen. I thank these bodies for their financial support.
    I wrote the revised version of my thesis presented in this volume as a
postdoctoral fellow at the MPI for Psycholinguistics in Nijmegen and in the
Surrey Morphology Group at the University of Surrey. I thank Steve Levinson
and Grev Corbett, respectively, for their help and support.
    Special thanks go to Don Gardner who first got me interested in working
on Mian. Don has been working as an anthropologist with the West Mianmin
for the last 30 years and I was lucky to be able to profit from his knowledge
and connections in Papua New Guinea. Don accompanied me on my first trip
for a couple of weeks, introduced me to the people and was generally an
invaluable help for me to adjust to the unfamiliar environment.
    The first one and a half months of my first field trip I spent in Yapsiei
station. I would like to thank Tesinab Balabe, with whom I worked there, and
Atupe, Father Ben and Father Albino of the Yapsiei mission station, Milan
Janda, who was researching moths in the area and who let me use his satellite
phone, and the kiap of Telefomin District Ricky Yentop Yaman.
    Further, I thank the National Research Institute of Papua New Guinea in
Port Moresby, especially Jim Robins, and the Provincial Government of
Sandaun Province in Vanimo, especially Eugene Raire and Ignatius Litiki.
    I thank Bernard Comrie and Bill Foley, the examiners of my dissertation,
for many critical comments and helpful suggestions which I incorporated into
the present book.
    Matthew Dryer, the cognizant editor for the Mouton Grammar Library,
closely read the whole manuscript. I am very grateful for his insightful
comments which made me change many aspects of the description and the
analysis and which thus greatly improved the quality of the grammar.

The language and its speakers
1.0.     IntroductionThe term Mian is not a native Mian word. Nevertheless, it is nowadays used as
an ethnonym and a logonym and as a toponym for the airstrip near the
Mianmin settlements Timeilmin and Temsakmin. Traditionally, the Mianmin
had no term for their people but used group or clan names which were
compounded with the nominal stem tn ‘people’, e.g. Usalei-tn and Kmeil-
tn, denoting the Mian clans who today live in the settlements Gubil and
Timeilmin, respectively.
    The noun mian means ‘dog’ in the related Ok languages Faiwol and Bimin
(Healey 1964a: 85) and in the distantly related Oksapmin language (Lawrence
1972a, Lawrence 1972b, Loughnane 2009). The story goes that when a patrol
came to Telefomin District in the mid 1930s and asked for information about
the people living towards the north and west of the Telefomin area, who
afterwards became known as the Mianmin, they learned the name ‘Mian’,
possibly because the Mianmin had a reputation as fierce warriors. This name
subsequently became the standard designation for the people under the
colonial administration and later was adopted by the Mianmin people
themselves. The Oksapmin know a mythical story of how the Mianmin got
their name. Near Oksapmin station there is a rock face amidst the rain forest
covering the steep wall of a mountain ridge. According to Oksapmin myth,
that was the place where a bitch gave birth to the first Mianmin in days of
yore. From there, they moved westward into lower altitude regions, into the
traditional and contemporary Mianmin area.1
    Linguists of the Summer Institute of Linguistics generally used the terms
‘Mianmin’ or ‘Oksapmin’ both as ethnonyms and language names. This
terminology gained wider currency through the classic literature on Papuan
languages (Wurm 1982, Foley 1986). Originally, the Mianmin called their
language wéng, which polysemously means ‘sound, voice, speech, language’.
Nowadays, they use Mian wéng ‘Mian language’. Most names of inhabited
places are compounds ending in am ‘house’, such as Mian-am ‘Mianmin’,
Temsel-am ‘Temsakmin’, Klefol-am ‘Telefomin’, Oksab-am ‘Oksapmin’ or in
bib ‘village, hamlet, place’, e.g. Kondu-bib, Skio-bib. I will use the term
‘Mian’ for the language (as an abbreviation of Mian wéng) and ‘Mianmin’ as
the ethnonym and as the toponym signifying the area around Mianmin airstrip.
2      1. The language and its speakers1.1.        Mian wéng: The Mian languageMian (also known as ‘Mianmin’ or ‘Miyanmin’ in the literature, ISO mpt) is a
Papuan language of the Ok family. The term ‘Papuan’ is not to be understood
as a name for a well-defined language family but as a residue category for the
non-Austronesian and non-Australian languages of the south-west Pacific
(Foley 1986, 2000).
   The Ok family of languages belongs to the larger Trans New Guinea
(TNG) family, and is of roughly the same order of internal diversification as
Germanic within Indo-European (Healey 1964a, Wurm 1982, Pawley 2005).
The Ok languages are named after the widespread cognate ok ‘river, water’ in
these languages.2 Mian is spoken by fewer than two thousand people in the
north-west of Telefomin District in Sandaun Province, Papua New Guinea.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"

5.8.     Verbs with obligatory classificatory prefixBelow are listed the most frequent verbs which require a classificatory prefix.
In a few cases, the classificatory prefix is frozen in the singular form of the
residue class ob-, e.g. ase ob-tanà/ase ob-tunu ‘light with fire’ and aaie ob-dî
‘fetch water’. In the case of the perfective-only stem -kilêb ‘put handle of bag
around forehead so that the bag hangs down the bag (in order to carry the
bag)’ the prefix is frozen as go- from the bundle class.(25)   -â’/—                 ‘leave, let’
       -atdi/—               ‘throw into fire’
       -atou/—               ‘put into fire’
       -ba/-bu               ‘put into a bag, cover’
       -bià/—                ‘push, throw’
       -blangkè/—            ‘push out of the way’

       -êb/—                 ‘take (in order to carry)’
       -fâ/-ka               ‘put’
       -fâa/—                ‘lift’
       -halila/-halin        ‘feel sorry for, be concerned about’
       —/-hâa’               ‘chase’
       -kimà/-kimsan         ‘put into fire’
       -ma/-san              ‘plant’
       -mêin/—               ‘fall’
       -meki/—               ‘hang up’
       -miki/—               ‘take (child) into arms to lull to sleep’
       -ò/—                  ‘take’
       -Ø(-)/—               ‘handle, transfer’

       -waa                ‘hide’Verbs with an obligatory classificatory prefix where the prefix has to index an
animate object are listed in (26).(26)   -klafâ/—     ‘put on back (piggy-back style)’
       -môu/—       ‘put on shoulder’ (pig or child)
       -silêb /—    ‘follow’
       -tamà/—      ‘pen in, imprison’
5.9.     Gender system vs. classification by prefixNominal categorization in Mian is complex due to the fact that two different
nominal classification systems, which show different formal and semantic
properties, exist next to and interact with each other.
   First, there is the category ‘gender’ with the masculine, feminine, neuter 1
and 2 subcategories. All pronominal affixes on the verb agree in person,
number and gender with the arguments they cross-reference. If the verb occurs
without overt noun phrase arguments, pronominal affixes agree anaphorically
with a previously mentioned overt noun phrase argument.
   These instances of agreement are predictable from the person, number and
gender of the nominal argument. In other words, pronominal affixes never
have any semantic impact on the noun or its noun phrase. Their function is to
indicate grammatical relations in the clause and to enable construal of any
overt arguments with their respective cross-referencing affix by showing
agreement.
   In addition, there are the categories (prefix classes) established by sets of
classificatory prefixes. There are four reasons why I consider this system of
classificatory prefixes to be different from the system of gender agreement.
   First, only some verbs with similar semantics of object manipulation or
handling participate in the system of classificatory prefixes, whereas
pronominal affixes can be found on all finite verbs.
196    5. Classificatory verb prefixes   Second, nominal classification by classificatory prefixes operates on an
absolutive basis, whereas the gender system does not.
   Third, formal means and semantic categorizations used by the two
classificatory systems are quite different (see below).
   Fourth, the system of classificatory prefixes has instances of ‘non-standard
agreement’, i.e. in certain contexts, choice of the prefix is not necessarily
predictable from formal features (e.g. gender) of a noun or semantic properties
(sex, shape) of its referent. Examples of this will be provided in 5.10 below.
Within the gender system, agreement patterns are always predictable from the
gender specification of a noun.
   Phonologically, classificatory prefixes are more complex than the
pronominal affixes which define the genders. First, almost all prefixes have
prefix variants conditioned by quite diverse phonological environments.
Second, two classificatory prefixes show vowel harmony with a following
vowel (see 2.7.1).
   Note also the differences in semantic split-up. In the gender system, the
main semantic distinctions are animacy and sex, establishing a masculine, a
feminine, and two neuter genders. The distinction between the neuter genders
is mainly a formal one between those nouns with a number contrast and those
without a number contrast, though one should recall that this is not exclusively
a formal distinction but also a semantic one since an overwhelming number of
N2-nouns, such as masses, locations, and abstract or intangible entities are
non-count nouns.
   In the system of classificatory prefixes, animacy/sex is also an important
categorization criterion but the M-class and the F-class contain many items
from the inanimate world. Moreover, shape (long object) and function
(bundle-like or covering object) are criteria for classification. The residue
class mainly contains inanimate nouns which are also of neuter 1 gender, but
not exclusively so (for example a few animates such as máab tóm ‘tortoise
species’) and the residue class is not co-extensive with this gender since many
neuter 1 nouns are classified as M-class, F-class, long, bundle, or covering by
the prefix system.
   To sum up, two nominal classification systems operate alongside each
other in Mian: (a) the gender system and (b) the system of classification
through classificatory verbal prefixes. The formal means employed by the
respective systems are clearly distinct and the semantic criteria for
classification yield two different ways of categorizing nouns.
                                                      5.10. Reclassification   1975.10.     ReclassificationReclassification refers to a different categorization of a noun due to the choice
of a different classificatory prefix in order, for example, to highlight a certain
feature of the referent. Reclassification in Mian mainly applies to nouns whose
referents are or can somehow be handled like bags, for instance bundles of
firewood or substantial chunks of pork which have a string or rope attached to
them. This characteristic of the referent is not expressed in the noun, but in the
classificatory prefix. An example of reclassification by using a different
classificatory prefix is given in (27) and (28):(27)    éil=o      om-fâ-n-e=be
        pork=N2 3SG.F_CL.O-put.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He put down the (piece of) pork.’(28)    éil=o     gol-meki-n-e=be
        pork=N2 3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He hung up the (piece of) pork (on a string).’In this case, the semantic impact of the classificatory prefixes of the bundle
class is hard to miss. The information that the referent of the object, namely
the meat, comes with a string or rope attached so that it can be carried around
or hung up like a bag or bundle does not reside in the noun itself, nor is it
included in the semantics of the verb stem. It might be argued that the verb
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’ necessarily takes gol-/gulel- as a prefix because its
semantics suggest that in order to hang something up it must be bundle-like or
at least have a handle. However, sosbên, a Tok Pisin loan which refers to
metal pots of various sizes with handles, cannot occur with the bundle class
prefixes, even though the action of hanging them up can be referred to by
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’:(29)    sosbên=e     ob-meki-n-e=be / *gol-meki-n-e=be
        pot=SG.N1    3SG.RESID.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
        ‘He hung up the pot.’Thus, the “hang-upability” of referents of objects of the verb -meki ‘hang up
(PFV)’ is more a selectional restriction of this verb rather than having anything
to do with the presence of the bundle class prefixes gol-/gulel-.
    In general the choice of a different prefix subtly changes the semantics of
an utterance. Compare:
198    5. Classificatory verb prefixes(30)   som=e
       banana_bunch=SG.N1       dob-meki-n-e=be
       3SG.M_CL.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He hung up the banana bunch (e.g. the whole bunch on a nail).’(31)   som=e
       banana_bunch=SG.N1       gol-meki-n-e=be
       3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He hung up the banana bunch (to which a string or rope is
       attached).’In (31), som=e ‘a/the banana bunch’ is reclassified as a bundle-like object.
Although the object is the same in (30) and (31), namely som=e in both cases,
the choice of prefixes indicates that in the former example the bunch of
bananas itself is hung over a hook or nail whereas in the latter example the
bunch has some string or rope attached to it, which is slipped over a hook or
nail.
   Example (31) can also have a different meaning, namely that the referent
of the object is a bag full of bananas. Bundle class prefixes can indicate that
the referent of the object is contained in a bag:(32)   tóm=e          gol-meki-n-e=be
       stone=SG.N1    3SG.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He hung up a bag full of stones.’If several bags are involved, the difference in number is expressed on the
article and on the verbal prefix, but the fact that the objects are in a bag is
solely conveyed by the bundle class prefix:(33)   tóm=o           gol-meki-n-e=be
       stone=PL.N1     PL.BUNDLE.O-hang_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I hung up bags full of stones.’The reclassification of a noun as bundle-like is not restricted to the verb
-meki ‘hang up (PFV)’. This can be seen in the following example:
                                                       5.10. Reclassification   199(34)   mn=e            y        gol-ò-n-e=a
       child=SG.M       there     3SG.BUNLDE.O-take.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘It (the wild boar) takes the boy (with the umbilical cord), and then…’
       [Afoksitgabáam]This sentence is from a story in which a pregnant woman is savaged by a wild
boar who tears her open, takes her unborn son, still attached to the umbilical
cord (the handle, so to say), and throws him on the ground. (The whole story
can be found in the text collection in appendix 1.)
   Reclassification of yóum ‘piece of clothing’, which is by default M-class
(35), to the covering class is exemplified in (36):(35)   yóum=e                         tek      dim=e
       piece_of_clothing=SG.N1        rope     on=SG.N1       do-fâ-n-ebo=be
       3SG.M_CL.O-put.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘You put the piece of clothing on the line.’(36)   yóum=o
       piece_of_clothing=SG.N1        geme-tlâa’-n-ebo=be
        PL.COVER.O-remove.PFV-REAL-2SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘You undressed (lit. ‘removed your clothes).’What the reclassification of ‘clothes’ effects in this case is the highlighting of
the fact that they had covered a person’s body before they were removed, as
stated in the utterance in (36) above.
    Another example of reclassification is provided in (37):(37)            tob-ò-n-e=a
       3SG.M 3SG.LONG.O-take.PFV-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘he took it (i.e. his long penis) and then ...’ [Selimin]In this example, the classificatory prefix tob- refers anaphorically back to the
previously mentioned éit ‘penis’, which is assigned to the residue class by
default. However, in order to emphasize the enormous length of the
protagonist’s member, the speaker uses the prefix of the long class.
    All of these examples illustrate that reclassification can be used quite
creatively in Mian.
200       5. Classificatory verb prefixes5.10.1.     Plurals of inanimate nouns of neuter 1 genderThe noun éim ‘pandanus fruit’ is classified by default as belonging to the
M-class and occurs with the prefixes dob-/dol-. However, when one wants to
refer to considerable numbers of these fruits, the residue plural prefix ol- is
used. The same happens with long objects which are normally classified as
long and occur with tob-/tebel-. If their numbers exceed a few, the plural
prefix ol- of the residue class is employed:(38)      kbo       geim=o                  tebel-ubmà

          ‘You are turning around (a few) pronged arrows in your hands.’(39)      kbo       geim=o                  ol-ubmà

          ‘You are turning around (quite a few) pronged arrows in your hands.’
5.10.2.     Use of F-class singular om- for broken and half objectsFor inanimate referents which are broken, the prefix om- is always possible as
an alternative to the bundle, covering, long, and residue class prefixes:(40)      mén=o
          string_bag=PL.N1          gulel-halin-b-i=be
          PL.BUNDLE.O-be_concerned.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘I am concerned about the string bags.’(41)      mén-o

          3SG.F_CL.O-be_concerned.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘I am concerned about the (heap of torn) string bags.’
                                                      5.10. Reclassification   201In this case, the use of the F-class singular prefix om- focuses on the fact that
the objects in question are indeed broken and thus not treated as individual
items anymore but more like a heap or a mass.
    The prefix om- is also employed for halves of formerly whole objects.
Compare:(42)   imen=e        ob-Øˆ-nen=e!
       taro=SG.N1 3SG.RESID.O-give.PFV-1SG.R=HORT
       ‘Give me the taro!’(43)   imen=e        om-Øˆ-nen=e!
       taro=SG.N1 3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-1SG.R=HORT
       ‘Give me the half taro!’Again, the examples (42) and (43) are instances of reclassification. The
semantic features ‘broken mass’ or ‘half’ are not expressed in the noun but lie
exclusively in the classificatory prefix.

The noun phrase
6.0.     IntroductionMian noun phrase syntax is rigid. All noun phrases conform to the following
structural template, which specifies the structure of maximally complex noun
phrases:           Prenominal
Possessor
             adjective
                           Head     Postnominal
  Prenominal relative                              Quantifier   Determiner
                           noun     adjective(s)
        clause
  Prenominal modifierThe head noun slot can only hold an item of the category N, which includes
verbal nouns. A pronoun can instantiate a full noun phrase. Headless
adjectives can constitute a noun phrase of their own. In that case the head
noun slot is empty.
   Any material filling the possessor slot must be either a possessive pronoun
or a noun phrase. The prenominal adjective slot can accommodate one
adjective of the two sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’. The head noun can be
preceded by a prenominal relative clause or by one of two prenominal
modifiers omômom ‘all kinds of’ and inamìn ‘such’. In these cases there must
not be a possessor. The postnominal adjective slot can be filled by one or
more adjectives. Postnominal adjectives are followed by quantifiers. The
determiner slot can be filled by the article or any of those pronouns which can
be used adnominally (Himmelmann 1997: 215-219).
   Table 6.1 lists examples illustrating noun phrases of different complexity.
All of these structures are discussed below. For a short overview of relative
clauses, see 6.3.8. For a detailed description of relative clauses, see 13.3.
   The normal situation in natural Mian discourse is that the clitic article
occurs only once on the rightmost constituent of a noun phrase that is used
referentially:(1)    tíl     milil     sm=e
       dog     black     big=SG.M
       ‘a/the big, black dog’

noun phrase. It can show up on the noun itself, and on any adjectival
modifiers:(2)        tíl=e          milil=e        sm=e
           dog=SG.M black=SG.M           big=SG.M
           ‘a/the big, black dog’
6.1.         Pronouns as noun phrasesThe forms of all pronoun series (except the possessive pronoun) can be used
pronominally, i.e. they can constitute noun phrases by themselves. For details
on the form and the semantics of the respective pronoun series and for more
examples, see 3.7.
    All of these can occur in subject position. Free pronouns occasionally
occur in object position whereas the other pronoun series are so far only
attested in subject position.
    Forms from either of the reflexive series appear as objects if their function
is to indicate reflexivity:(3)        n     nmaye/neleskîl     gò’-Ø-i-obe

English ‘I myself killed the pig’, the pronoun can appear in apposition to an
overt subject noun phrase, as in (4) or on its own in lieu of an overt subject
noun phrase, as in (5):(4)      naka    le                  -maye            éil=o

6.2.      Minimal noun phrasesMinimal noun phrases consist either of a bare noun, i.e. a noun without any
determiner, or a noun followed by a determiner, e.g. a clitic article or an
adnominal pronoun.","[220, 221, 222, 223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231]"

3.2.     VerbsAs verbs are morphologically by far the most complex word class in Mian, I
will only be concerned with the defining features at this point and only give a
few examples to illustrate the most fundamental points about verb inflection in
Mian. For a detailed treatment of the morphology of the verb the reader is
referred to chapter 8.
    Loans from Tok Pisin or English cannot be inflected like native Mian
verbs, but rather such loans have to be followed by the function verb ke ‘do’ in
a function verb construction:(36)             futbol        pilai        ke-b-io=be
       3PL.AN     football(TP) play(TP)      do-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
       ‘They are playing football.’Mian has intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, ambitransitive, and impersonal
(atransitive) verbs. Transitives can be productively derived from intransitives
and ditransitives from transitives. On basic argument structures and derived
ones, see sections 9.1 to 9.7.
    Semantically, verbs refer to actions, processes, and states. Verbs fulfil the
function of the predicate of a clause.
    Suprasegmentally, verbs are either unaccented, in which case they are all-
low, or are lexically specified for an accent to which one of two complex tonal
melodies (either HL or LHL) is assigned. Nouns, on the other hand, are
associated with one of five tonal melodies.
    Syntactically, verbs are easily identified. Mian is an SOV language.
Although there is some pragmatically motivated variability with respect to the
position of subject and object, the last word in a clause is almost always the
verb and under no circumstances can the verb be followed by any of its
arguments. Occasionally, however, one finds locative adjuncts postposed after
the verb which are adverbial modifiers of the preceding verb syntactically, but
which form their own intonational unit (see 11.2.10).
    Morphologically, verbs can index their core arguments with pronominal
affixes cross-referencing subject (37) and object (38):
102    3. Word classes and grammatical relations(37)    lo     y      fu-m-i=be
       now    there smoke.IPFV.INCH-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘Now I start smoking.’ [Rolling smokes](38)   ya-temê’-b-e=a
       PL.AN.O-look_at.IPFV-DS.SIM-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘while he was watching them, (they …)’ [Danenok]For more information on the indexation of arguments on the verb, see the
sections 3.14 on grammatical relations, 8.5 on argument marking, and 9.2 on
transitive verbs.
   Final verbs, i.e. verbs in independent sentences or in final clauses of clause
chains, can be inflected for various aspectual categories, e.g. -b ‘Imperfective’
(39), modal categories, e.g. -n ‘Realis’ (40), and temporal categories, e.g. -s
‘Remote past’ (41):(39)   sm     y         gen-b-i=be
       still   there      roll.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I am still rolling.’ [Rolling smokes](40)   as=e          fa-n-e=be
       fire=SG.N1    make_fire.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He (has) made a fire’(41)   y le    éil=e          a-nâ’-s-ib=e?
       well    pig=SG.M 3SG.M.O-kill.PFV-RPST-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=Q
       ‘Well, did they kill the pig?’ [Mianmin and Telefomin]Medial verbs, i.e. verbs in non-final clauses in clause chains, can be inflected
for co- or disjoint reference of the subject in the succeeding clause in
combination with sequentiality or simultaneity of events. In (42), the suffix -b
‘DS.SIM’ indicates that the event described in the first clause is on-going
when the event described by the second clause takes place and that this second
clause has a different subject:(42)   gwáab=i          -maye                 dowôn’
       small=PL.AN      3PL.AN-REFL            eat.PFV       unê-b-ib=a
       go.IPFV-DS.SIM-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
                                                                 3.2. Verbs   103       haleb          -ta           te-s-e=a

       ‘the small (ones) themselves ate and (then) were going away, when
       a wild boar came’ [Afoksitgabáam]A subset of verbs, almost all of which make predications of handling or
movement, has an obligatory classificatory prefix which classifies one of the
arguments according to semantic characteristics, namely sex, form, and
function, on an absolutive basis. In (43), the object fukêt ‘smoking gourd’ is
classified as belonging to the residue class.(43)                     dab=o
       3PL.AN.POSS        same_sex_siblings(dyad)=COLL       fukêt=e

       3SG.RESID.O-take.PFV-SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
       ‘the brothers took a smoking gourd’ [Danenok]About half of the verbs show an aspectual stem distinction with a
perfective/imperfective contrast. The rest are trans-aspectual, i.e. they have
only one stem which is vague with respect to aspect. A few verbs are defective
and lack either a perfective or an imperfective stem. Formally distinct
perfective and imperfective stems are subject to certain inflectional
restrictions, e.g. a perfective stem cannot be directly inflected for imperfective
aspect but has to enter an auxiliary construction. Trans-aspectual stems are not
restricted in terms of their inflectional morphology.
   For certain tense-aspect combinations, some verbs cannot be inflected
directly, but have to be serialized with the existential verb functioning as an
auxiliary before inflection can proceed:(44)   fu      unan-biaana-b-io=be
       cook    eat.IPFV-AUX.HAB.PST-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
       ‘They used to cook and eat (some kind of fruit) until now.’Two verb stems can be compounded into one phonological and grammatical
verbal word which forms a single predication denoting a single event. Verbs
also frequently appear in serial verb constructions in which only the last verb
is fully inflected and all preceding verbs are either bare verb stems or stems
with affixes indexing any object(s) but lack TAM inflection or marking for
104    3. Word classes and grammatical relationssubject, polarity or illocutionary force. Mian allows verb serialization at the
core or the nuclear level. See 11.1 for a detailed description of verb
serialization.
    Directionals can be directly inflected to form intransitive verbs of motion,
for example from daak ‘down’:(45)   daak-n-i=a
       down-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
       ‘I go down and then I…’.","[127, 128, 129, 130]"
"
6.3.5.    QuantifiersThe class of quantifiers comprises numerals and the quantifying expressions
homòn ‘many’, alukûm ‘all, every, each’, and alik ‘all, every, each’. Numerals
usually appear without an article. In Mian, pronouns from the ‘alone’-series
elekiêm (also eleyêm) ‘he/it alone’ and olokiêm (also oloyêm) ‘she/it alone’
double as the numeral ‘one’:(28)     naka=e      elekiêm
         man=SG.M    one.M
         ‘one man’ OR ‘the man alone’(29)     unáng=o      olokiêm
         woman=SG.F one.F
         ‘one woman’ OR ‘the woman alone’The only two basic numerals Mian has are asú ‘two’ and asumâtna ‘three’.
The former has a variant asusûna, which looks like a partial reduplication of
the simple numeral asú ’two’. Nonetheless, asusûna means ‘two’, not ‘four’:
212    6. The noun phrase(30)   unáng=i              asú(=ei)/asusûna(=i)
       woman=PL.AN          two(=PL.AN)
       ‘two women’Numerals larger than three are phrasal and involve stringing together instances
of asú=ke ‘two=and’ (i.e. the numeral asú ‘two’ and the function verb stem ke
‘do’ serving as a coordinator in phrasal numerals) as many times as needed to
count to any even number and rounding this off by make ‘(one) other’ for odd
numbers. Phrasal numerals occur with the verbal element na ‘do’, if they carry
an article:(31)   unáng=i           asú=ke asú=ke
       woman=PL.AN two=do two=do
       ‘four women’ (lit. ‘two and two women’)(32)   memé         asú=ke asú=ke make             na=i
       children     two=do two=do other            do=PL.AN
       ‘five children’ (lit. ‘two and two children and another’)Numerals always occur after adjectival modifiers:(33)   memé          gwáab=i         asumâtna
       children      little=PL.AN    three
       ‘three little children’Instead of a numeral denoting an exact figure, the quantifier slot in the noun
phrase can be filled by homòn ‘many’:(34)   tíl=i         milil=i             sm=i         homòn=i
       dog=PL.AN black=PL.AN             big=PL.AN     many=PL.AN
       ‘many big black dogs’The quantifier alukûm ‘all, every, each’ usually follows the whole noun phrase
but can also precede it. The quantifier alik ‘all, every, each’ is only attested
following the noun phrase. The exact semantic difference between the two is
unclear.
    Neither alukûm nor alik can take an article or any other determiner:(35)   Mianam=o     naka=i          alukûm/alik        am-sa=be
       PN=N2        man=PL.AN       all/all            house-with=DECL
       ‘The men of Mianmin all have a house.’
                                                  6.3. Modified noun phrases   213Alukûm and alik can be employed to express that some event affected an
inanimate object in its entirety:(36)     afonón         =sa           alukûm
         shin_bone      PL.N1=too      all         kib-a-Ø-o=be
         ash-VBLZ-REAL-3N1.PL.SBJ=DECL
         ‘The shinbones too became all ashes.’ (lit. ‘all “ashified” ’) [Crows]The quantifier alukûm can precede the whole noun phrase:(37)     alukûm      asyam=o          klaan-Ø-o=be
         all         fruit=PL.N1      rot.PFV-REAL-3PL.N1.SBJ=DECL
         ‘All fruits have rotted.’
6.3.6.     The intensifiers dót ‘very’, wekîb ‘very’, and klâ ‘really’The intensifiers dót ‘very’, wekîb ‘very’, and klâ ‘really’ can be used to
modify attributive adjectives or the quantifier homòn ‘many’. Intensifiers
always precede the adjective or the quantifier:(38)     tíl     milil      dót      sm=e
         dog     black      very     big=SG.M
         ‘a very big, black dog’(39)     tíl      klâ       milil     sm=e
         dog      really    black     big=SG.M
         ‘a big, really black dog’(40)     dót   homòn=o=be
         very many=PRD=DECL
         ‘(There are) Very many.’Only one modifier can be intensified per noun phrase, that is if there are two
modifiers, either of them but not both may be modified by an intensifier. It is
however possible to have two intensifiers in front of a modifier:(41)     kofi          dót klâ         kok=e
         coffee(TP) very really        sour=SG.N1
         ‘some really very sour coffee’
214      6. The noun phrase6.3.7.     Demonstratives in the noun phraseDemonstratives go in the determiner slot at the right edge of the noun phrase.
This is illustrated for a simple demonstrative in (42) and (43), and for an
emphatic demonstrative in (44):(42)     naka     asumâtna    li
         man      three       DEM.PROX.PL.AN

internal. Both types of relative clause will be described in detail in section
13.3 under embedding.
    Prenominal relative clauses precede their head noun. They do not receive
any marking indicating subordination. An example of a prenominal relative
clause is given in (47):(47)     balubib=y        mâa’-bl-Ø-ib
         airstrip=at       stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ         naka=i
         man=PL.AN
         ‘the men who are standing at the airstrip.’Head-internal relative clauses are obligatorily marked with a proper subset of
determiners, all of which are also used to mark non-relativized noun phrases.
They function as noun phrases occupying the argument position which the
head noun has in the main clause, for example the object in (48):(48)     naka=i         balubib     y
         man=PL.AN      airstrip    at         mâa’-bl-Ø-ib=i

         PL.AN.O-see.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
         ‘I am looking at the men who are standing at the airstrip.’In head-internal relative clauses, the head noun can be omitted. The
restrictions concerning omission of the head noun are examined in more detail
in section 13.3.3. An example is:(49)     balubib y mâa’-bl-Ø-ib=i
         airstrip at stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=PL.AN
         ‘the (ones) who are standing at the airstrip’In each of the examples above, the subject is relativized. Objects, possessors
and – at least in prenominal relative clauses – locatives can also be relativized.
216    6. The noun phrase    Constituent order in relative clauses is no different from the order in
independent clauses, with one noteworthy exception where the internal head
of a relative clause shows some mobility unattested in simple declarative
sentences (see 13.3.7). Verbs in relative clauses show all inflectional
possibilities of a (sentence-final) verb in an independent sentence in terms of
tense, aspect, mood, and argument marking. For example, they can be
inflected for irrealis or deontic mood, which medial verbs cannot.
    Head-internal relative clauses are much more frequent than prenominal
ones in natural discourse. Nearly all examples of prenominal relative clauses
are elicited. However, in most cases the prenominal variant of a head-internal
relative clause was offered immediately by the speaker without any further
question as to whether a prenominal relative construction was also possible.","[237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242]"

9.5.      DitransitivesThe verb -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is an underived ditransitive. It belongs to the class
of verbs which obligatorily cross-reference and classify the theme object, i.e.
the gift, with a classificatory prefix (see 9.2.1). In addition, it also takes an
object suffix that cross-references the recipient argument (plus another suffix
for the subject). Thus, -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is an examples of triple agreement,
i.e. the indexing of subject and two objects (theme and recipient) by affixes on
the verb (Fedden 2010). Triple agreement is a typologically rare phenomenon,
both in Papuan languages and world-wide (Foley 2000). An example of -ûb’-
‘give (PFV)’ is given in (55):

       ‘I gave the sow to the man.’For details on the derived nature of the imperfective counterpart -ka- ‘give
(IPFV)’, the reader is referred to 9.6.2.2.
    The ditransitive verb -fu- ‘send to (PFV-only)’1 involves compounding with
-ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ in order to introduce the recipient argument. It indexes the
theme with a classificatory prefix. The recipient argument is marked by a
suffix on the ‘give’-morpheme compounded with the main verb. Consider
example (56):(56)              baa-n-o=a                            futâan=o

       ‘She said she would send a letter to him.’ (lit. ‘She said: “I will
       send a letter to him.” ’)Although the recipient role of -fu- ‘send to (PFV)’ is obligatorily introduced
through serialization with ‘give’, which suggests derivation from a simpler
transitive base, such a transitive base does not exist: *-fu ‘send (PFV)’. Hence,
an utterance like (57) is ungrammatical regardless of whether the recipient is
expressed with a free noun phrase (in this case the pronoun n ‘me’):(57)   *futaan=o      (n)    om-fu-n-e=be
       letter=N2     (1SG) 3SG.F_CL.O-send.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       Intended: ‘He sent (me) a letter.’The same applies to ale- ‘show’, which lacks a transitive base *ale. As for -fu-
‘send to (PFV)’, the recipient argument, or in the case of ‘show’ the recipient-
like argument, is introduced by ‘give’ in the perfective. The theme participant,
i.e. the ‘shown’, is never cross-referenced on the verb by a pronominal affix
but can be encoded as a free noun phrase, as in (58):
                                                   9.6. Derived ditransitives   353(58)     kasak=e

         show-give.PFV-PL.AN.R-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ-GPST=MED
         ‘they had shown us the Kasak (ritual), and then someone else...’
         [Kasak ritual]In natural Mian discourse overt noun phrase arguments are typically elided if
their identity is retrievable from the context even if the argument is not
indexed on the verb. Parallel to the case of elided object noun phrases in
transitive verbs, which were discussed in section 9.2.4 above, I have no
evidence suggesting that the verb ale- ‘show’ becomes monotransitive, i.e.
only has a subject and a recipient object (indexed with a suffix), when the
overt object noun phrase (referring to the entity shown) is elided. Therefore, I
analyse ale- ‘show’ as an underived ditransitive verb whose object noun
phrase can be freely elided without assuming a change in argument structure.
    To sum up, the clearest example of an underived ditransitive verb in Mian
is -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’. It encodes the theme with a set of prefixes and the
recipient and the subject with two different sets of suffixes. In the case of -fu-
‘send to (PFV)’, we are dealing with a lexicalization, which is underived (at
least in contemporary Mian). A similar argument can be made for ale- ‘show
to (PFV)’.","[377, 378, 379]"

394       10. Question formation10.2.3.     fatnà- ‘do what?’This is an interrogative pro-verb (Hagège 2008) consisting of the interrogative
word fàb and the verb stem na ‘do’. Fatnà ‘do what?’ can be inflected as a
verb and has the meaning ‘do what’:(27)      fatnà-b-eb=e?
          do_what-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=CQ
          ‘What are you doing?’ [Observed]There is a case to be made that fatnà is best analysed as an interrogative pro-
verb, i.e. as a single root which contains both a verbal and an interrogative
meaning. Such interrogative pro-verbs can be found in Papuan languages, e.g.
Kuot (Lindström 2002), Austronesian languages, e.g. Paamese (Crowley
1982) and Australian languages, e.g. Kayardild (Evans 1995: 371-372) and
Dyirbal (Dixon 1972). Outside the Pacific area, interrogative verbs can for
example be found in West Greenlandic (Kalaallisut) (Sadock 1984: 206).
   In Paamese, there is an intransitive monomorphemic interrogative verb
kosaa ‘do what’, which is not segmentable into an interrogative and a verbal
element (Crowley 1982: 159).
   For Kayardild, Evans (1995: 371) analyses the pro-verb ngaakawatha ‘do
what’ as an inchoative form of the interrogative word ngaaka ‘what/who’.
Here, the pro-verb is derived from an interrogative word with the suffix
-watha which derives verbs from nominals (Evans 1995: 282).
   The degree of fusion between the interrogative and the verbal element in
fatnà is relatively low. The interrogative word fàb and the verb stem na ‘do’
can still clearly be discerned. /b/ goes to [t] before the alveolar nasal /n/. This
form of place assimilation applies across the board in Mian and is thus not
necessarily indicative of a beginning fusion between the interrogative and the
verb stem.
   On the other hand, there is a semantic shift of the interrogative word fàb
from ‘where’ to ‘what’ in fatnà. Bare fàb cannot mean ‘what’, while fatnà
cannot mean ‘do where’. It contrasts with fàb na ‘do where’. As the meaning
of fàb is clearly construction-specific here, the meaning of fatnà cannot be
said to be fully transparent anymore. Also, the [t] in the interrogative verb
ftna is often elided in normal and fast speech to yield fanà ‘do what’. I
therefore analyse fatnà as an interrogative pro-verb, albeit one with a low
degree of fusion between the interrogative and the verbal part.
   The core meaning of fatnà is ‘do what’:(28)      n      ul        lo                 dowôn’-aam-i=o

is closer to ‘why’, as in (29) or ‘how’, as in (30):(29)                  fanà-n-o=ta

       ‘How has he escaped me?’ [Klebein]
       (lit. ‘What has he done, has he gone on me?’)The last two examples also shed some light on the syntactic and
morphological behaviour of fatnà in content questions.
   First, these forms function as verbs and are heads of their own clauses as
can be seen in (29), which consists of a medial clause  fatnànota and a final
clause besao mebone. This is captured in the literal translations above. Like
medial verbs, inflected fatnà is subject to the usual inflectional restrictions for
medial verbs, namely that they cannot be marked for polarity or for irrealis or
deontic mood.
   Second, the bare stem fatnà can appear in shortened medial clauses under
subject identity as in (30). If the verb in the following clause has the same
subject, Mian medial verbs can be shortened to just the stem which is marked
as a medial verb by the clitic =ta (see 11.2.13).
   Therefore, fatnà ‘do what’ is a morphologically and syntactically regular
verb in many respects. It can also form hortative verb forms (31) and appear in
purposive serializations (32):(31)    fatnà-n-an=e?

          ‘You go to do what?’
10.2.4.     The verbal noun fatnàmin ‘what’The interrogative word fatnàmin has the basic meaning ‘what’. As an isolated
utterance, fatnàmin is interpreted as ‘what’, ‘why’, or ‘how’. Unlike a
question with bare fàb, a question with fatnàmin can optionally be marked
with the content question clitic =e:(33)      fatnàmin?/ fatnàmin=e?    ‘What (is it)?’/‘Why (is it)?’/‘How (is it)?’If fatnàmin appears in an argument position of a verb, as in (34), i.e. in the
position the argument constituent will have in an appropriate answer sentence,
as in (35), it means ‘what’:(34)      Q:    kbo      fatnàmin dowôn’-aamab-eb=e?

                ‘I want to eat pork.’As no interrogative containing fàb can ever be used to inquire about animates,
the argument position fatnàmin occupies is usually that of the object of the
verb.
   Inanimate subjects of the (intransitive) existential verb n/bi~bl, can be
queried by using fatnàmin:(36)      Q:    fatnàmin y      bi-Ø-e=ne?

                 ‘There is a taro (tuber).’In its adnominal use fatnàmin precedes the noun phrase and means either
‘what kind of’ or ‘how many’. Thus, the questions in (38) and (39) below are
                                                      10.2. Content questions     397ambiguous as to whether the speaker requests information about quality, i.e.
‘what kind of’, or quantity, i.e. ‘how many’. Generally, the context has to
disambiguate:(38)      fatnàmin lais         sm bi-Ø-e=ne?

          he build?’In order to unambiguously express that they are interested to learn about
quantity and not quality or kind, younger speakers tend to use fatnàmin-fela
for ‘how much/many’. This construction is calqued from Tok Pisin hamaspela

which only had three basic numerals and by combining them counted to
around six or seven. Larger quantities were designated as ‘many’. I assume
that the meaning ‘how many’ for fatnàmin developed as a secondary sense
from ‘what, what kind of’.","[418, 419, 420, 421, 422, 423]"

    In a nuclear SVC, the second verb does not gap its object prefix. In (19),
baa ‘say (PFV)’ and -fâ ‘put (PFV)’ share the object, which can only be wéng
‘talk’, and the object is indexed by the classificatory prefix om- on the second
member of the nuclear SVC because this is a lexical requirement of -fâ ‘put
(PFV)’. This distinguishes nuclear SVC from verb compounds, where any
prefixes on the second member of the compound need to be gapped (see 3.2.2
on V-V compounds).(19)              wéng=o

11.1.3.     Verb serialization versus compounding (synopsis)In this section I outline the main differences between verb serialization and
V-V compounds and give a synopsis of these differences. For more on V-V
compounds, see 3.2.2. V-V compounds are similar to nuclear SVCs. They are
restricted to two verb stems, they do not allow separate objects and they do
not allow aspect to be at variance. However, a V-V compound is always
realized as a single phonological word. It constitutes a single domain for tone
assignment, whereas the verbs in nuclear SVCs are phonologically
independent, constituting two separate tonal domains. Furthermore, the stems
in V-V compounds can show some degree of fusion of the verb stems. So
while nuclear SVCs are only grammatical but not phonological units, V-V
compounds are both grammatical and phonological units. See Crowley (1987:
59-61) for a similar argument for the distinction of nuclear SVCs and
compounds in Paamese.
   An example of a Mian V-V compound is given in (20):(20)      no=i
          marsupials=PL.AN          ya-l-êt-n-e=ta
          PL.AN.O-kill.PFV-take.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
          ‘he killed and took the marsupials and then he…’ [Crows]The compound is ya-l-êt ‘kill and take them’. Semantically, these describe
discrete events, a ‘killing’-event and a ‘taking’-event. The two serialized verb
stems are -lò ‘kill (PFV)’ and -êb ~ -êt ‘take in order to carry (PFV)’, which
share the same aspectual value ‘perfective’ and the same object, i.e. no=i ‘the
marsupials’. The sequence of verbs is realized as a single phonological word
and shows fusion due to the deletion of /o/ (-lò ‘kill’ > l). The HL tonal
melody on -lò ‘kill’ is deleted before a verb with a LHL melody and the LHL
melody of -êb ‘take in order to carry (PFV)’ applies to the entire verb in (20).
   The first stem -lò ‘hit, kill (PFV)’ cross-references the object of the whole
sequence noi ‘the marsupials’ with the object prefix ya-, while the second
stem -êb drops its classificatory prefix under argument identity. Outside of
nuclear serializations the verb -êb ‘take in order to carry (PFV)’ obligatorily
occurs with a classificatory object prefix, as in (21):

"The assignment of dleb ‘sullen, irritable’, gaang ‘wise’ to the class of
adjectives is tentative because these two items are not well attested in the
corpus. Collocations like naka gaang ‘wise man’ and naka dleb ‘sullen man’
have head-modifier order and suggest that these two items are indeed
adjectives. Other concepts relating to human propensity, such as ‘hungry’,
‘angry’, ‘envious’, ‘happy’, ‘ashamed’ are expressed using (complex) verbs.
    Mian does not conform to the typological tendency noted by Dixon (2004:
4) that speed terms are in the adjective class if terms relating to physical
property are also in the adjective class. The two speed terms hebmamsâb ‘fast’
and fiab ‘slow’ are in the class of adverbs, whereas physical property terms
are adjectives.
    Suprasegmentally, adjectives – like nouns – are lexically specified for one
accent and one out of four tonal melodies (i.e. L, H, LH, and LHL). The HL
melody is unattested in adjectives. Adjectives function as modifiers of nouns
in noun phrases but can also be used as the only constituent of a headless noun
phrase and as the predicate in non-verbal clauses. As modifiers, adjectives
always follow the noun they modify with the notable exception of sin ‘old’
and memâ ‘new’, which can (and tend to) occur before the noun.
116    3. Word classes and grammatical relations   If a noun and an adjective occur in a head-modifier relation in a noun
phrase, both constituents can be followed by an article (or other adnominal
determiner) reflecting number and gender:(72)   tíl=e         sm=e
       dog=SG.M      big=SG.M
       ‘the big dog’Alternatively, – and this is more common in natural discourse – a single article
follows the rightmost constituent. Semantically, the utterances in (72) and (73)
are equivalent:(73)   tíl     sm=e
       dog     big=SG.M
       ‘the big dog’A small subset of adjectives, e.g. sm ‘big, loud, much’, gwáab ‘small, soft,
little’, ayam ‘good’, and misiam ‘bad’, but not ninik ‘dirty’ or teke(bmín)
‘long’, nor any of the colour adjectives, can be used adverbially to modify a
verb. Adjectives with adverbial function are not followed by an article and
occur immediately before the verb they modify. Two examples are given
below:(74)   mn       gwáab=o           sm me-b-o=be
       child     little=SG.F       big    cry.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The little girl is crying loud.’ [Observed](75)   ns=o          ayam     ngaan-b-o=be
       song=N2        good     sing.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
       ‘She is singing a song/songs beautifully.’Example (75) contrasts with (76) below in that in the former ayam ‘good’ is
used as an adverb, whereas it is used as an attributive adjective in (76). As
such it appears with an article to indicate that it modifies the head noun ns
‘song(s)’:(76)   ns=o             ayam=o        ngaan-b-o=be
       song=N2           good=N2       sing.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
       ‘She is singing (a) beautiful song(s).’Adverbial use is attested for the following adjectives: afan ‘wrong’, afet
‘different’, ayam ‘good’, ayók ‘secretly’, báin ‘true’, beselîb ‘huge, very
                                                             3.4. Adjectives   117loud’, dam ‘true’, gaang ‘wise’, gwáab ‘small, soft’, kat ‘flat’, keim ‘in the
open’, kweital ‘correct’, meleng ‘pleasant’, mikík ‘new, firstly’, misiam ‘bad’,
moton ‘true’, mubiang ‘last’, sm ‘big, loud’.
    A sizable subset of adjectives can be used as a secondary predicate in a
clause. Secondary predicates look like adjectives with adverbial function, i.e.
they occur before the verb without a determiner, but their function is not to
modify the event but to make a predication about an argument of the verb, as
in (77):(77)   naka=e      n=e            molot       klâ-n-e=be
       man=SG.M arrow=SG.N1 straight fix-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘The man fashioned the arrow straight.’Secondary predication is common with verbs of perception to express an
inherent property of the source (78) or the attitude of the experiencer towards
the source (79):(78)   le                     gliglî

       ‘It smells nice.’Secondary predication is possible for the following adjectives: abil ‘heavy (of
weight)’, asít/isít ‘raw’, asitêm/isitêm ‘new, fresh’, ayam ‘well’, ayók
‘hidden’, beit(lok) ‘soft, weak’, beselîb ‘huge’, bún ‘unripe (pumpkin)’, dakal

‘curved, twisted’, hanggôl ‘bitter (of poor-quality tobacco)’, heil ‘tender (of
shoots and plants)’, hilil ‘hairy’, hon ‘barren (of plant)’, ilúm ‘heavy (of
weight)’, kat ‘flat’, katbon ‘thin (of objects)’, ket ‘unripe (of banana)’, kiblot
‘straight, level’, kining/kling ‘smooth’, kobóm ‘mute’, kok ‘sour, bitter’, kwam
‘wide’, mebwêing ‘short’, meleng ‘pleasant, nice’, meme ‘mute’, mimín ‘hot’,
misiam ‘bad’, molot ‘straight’, ningning ‘thorny’, snab ‘strong in taste (of
ripe fruits)’, sbál ‘hard, strong’, sismik ‘blurred’, slislî ‘rough’, sm ‘big,
loud’, takal ‘rotten (of meat)’, teke(bmín) ‘long’, tetéb ‘narrow (of two-
118    3. Word classes and grammatical relationsdimensional objects, such as floor boards, cloth, etc.)’, tibkal ‘narrow (of
three-dimensional objects)’, tikan ‘big’, tol ‘hot, spicy’, yangyang ‘thorny’.
    Common nouns and adjectives are formally very similar. Both categories
are without any inflectional morphology. Like nouns, adjectives can function
as the predicate in non-verbal clauses and can have verbs derived from them
with the inchoative derivational suffix -an, expressing the inception of the
state or property denoted by the adjective.
    Most adjectives do not reduplicate productively. There are a few
lexicalized adjective reduplications, such as kengkeng ‘tiny’, ningning
‘thorny’, gliglî ‘rough’, and dangdang ‘thin’. The adjectives sm, in the sense
of ‘great’ (not dimensional “bigness”) and afet ‘different’ can be used in
reduplicated form to emphasize plurality or variety (see 6.3.4).
    Adjectives can appear on their own as headless adjectives in noun phrases
without an overt nominal head. Compare (80) with an adjectival modifier and
(81) with a headless adjective:(80)   tíl=e         sm=e          a-têm’-Ø-al=e!
       dog=SG.M      big=SG.M       3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-2SG.HORT=HORT
       ‘Look at the big dog!’(81)   sm=e         a-têm’-Ø-al=e!
       big=SG.M      3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-2SG.HORT=HORT
       ‘Look at the big (one)!’Examples like (81) could be taken as evidence to claim that Mian lumps
adjectives and nouns together in a single word class. However, we need to set
up a class of adjectives distinct from nouns for two reasons.
    First, there is a clear syntactic ordering principle between noun head and
adjectival modifier within the noun phrase. Besides the exceptions sin and
memâ noted above, all adjectival modifiers must follow the noun. Thus, one
finds: tíl=e sm=e and tíl sm=e ‘a/the big dog’ but not *sm=e tíl=e or *sm
tíl=e, neither with the same intended meaning nor any other meaning.
    Second, and more importantly, nouns are lexically specified for one
gender. The only exceptions are a few nouns which commonly undergo cross-
classification, i.e. pick their gender according to the sex of the referent (see
4.3). Adjectives, on the other hand, are not specified for gender. Although
adjectival modifiers do not have any inflectional markers which agree in
gender with the noun, any article or other determiner following the adjective
always does. In case of a headless adjective, as in (81) above, agreement
patterns in the determiner follow the gender of the noun normally used to refer
to a given referent.

possible to express a superlative meaning with the intensifier dót ‘very’:(82)   le                  bib        lo                   dót      teke=be

       this village’)Comparisons can be expressed with adjectival antonyms, as in (83), or,
alternatively, in a two-clause structure involving the verb gai- ‘(by)pass,
surpass, outdo’, as in (84):(83)   Mosbi      =le         sm      eka    Banimo       -ta

       a_lot     go_up.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘He is taller than me.’ (lit. ‘He surpasses me, he goes up a lot)There is a bipartite modifier ADJ1 tab ADJ2 tab ‘in between ADJ1 and ADJ2’
(lit. ‘ADJ1 down ADJ2 down’), which is generally used with antonyms. It
locates a property roughly in equal distance from the scalar poles established
by the antonyms ADJ1 and ADJ2, e.g.:(85)   ayam tab misiam tab        ‘soso, between good and bad’
       kining tab gliglî tab      ‘between smooth and rough’Mian has a substantial colour vocabulary. Colour words show the same
syntactic and morphological behaviour as adjectives. They follow the noun
they modify, can take an article, which agrees in number and gender with the
noun, and they appear as headless adjectives.
    The colour word inventory is substantial and Tok Pisin loan colour words,
such as blekpela ‘black’, blupela ‘blue’, and retpela ‘red’, are rarely used. The
full inventory consists of:
120    3. Word classes and grammatical relations(86)   namâ            ‘bright, white’ (cf. wan namâ ‘cockatoo’)
       milil           ‘dark, black’ (cf. mililanobe ‘it has become dark’)
       ilem            ‘red; blood’

       mt             ‘dark(er) green; bile’
       kb             ‘brown (ash)’Three colour words have variants: ilemein (analogous to ngáamein ‘yellow’)
‘red’, which – in contrast to ilem – can only be a colour adjective and not refer
to ‘blood’, mok ‘blue’ and moklim ‘blue’, and kosnal ‘orange’.
    There are two colour modifiers which are only used with colour adjectives.
They always follow the colour adjective:(87)   sibsib      ‘off-COLOUR TERM’, e.g. namâ sibsib ‘off-white’
       tlaal       ‘dark’, e.g. mokim tlaal ‘dark blue’Two adjectives are also used to modify colour adjectives. They always follow
the colour adjective:(88)   eing        ‘thick, spacious; luscious’; e.g. itanasít eing ‘luscious green’
       moton       ‘true, real’, e.g. ilem moton ‘real red’The adjectival modifier ADJ1 tab ADJ2 tab ‘between ADJ1 and ADJ2’ can be
used with colour adjectives, e.g.:(89)   kosmale     tab     ilem    tab

These are omômom ‘all kinds of’ and inamìn ‘such’. Nouns modified in such a
way cannot be possessed. An example is given below:(91)   omômom           wan=i            baa-Ø-ib=a
       all_kinds_of     bird=PL.AN       say.PFV-DS.SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
       ‘All kinds of birds talked and then someone else …’ [Crows]These might look similar to adjectives given the fact that the adjectives sin
‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ can actually appear prenominally but they need to be
separated from adjectives because they can never follow the noun while the
adjectives sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’ can also follow the noun like any other
adjective. Furthermore, omômom ‘all kinds of’ and inamìn ‘such’ cannot be
intensified while this is generally possible for adjectives.","[141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147]"
"
8.6.9.     ImperativeIn order to issue a direct command to a second person singular a bare
perfective verb stem with any obligatory classificatory prefixes and
pronominal object affixes is used, for example:(203) baa          ‘Say (it)!’
      te           ‘Come!’
      obbià        ‘Throw it!’8
      deibâ        ‘Leave him!’9The exact semantic difference between these imperative forms and the
hortative forms in the second person singular described in the previous section
is hard to assess. It is my impression that a bare stem conveys a stronger
directive force than the hortative form of the same verb. As bare stems can
only refer to the second person singular and hortative forms are attested for all
person-number combinations, I am inclined to set up an additional category
‘Imperative’.
    A similar situation (i.e. where there is a full hortative inflectional paradigm
and bare stems can be used for commands directed only at the second person
singular) can be found in the Papuan language Korafe (Farr 1999: 20, 30).
    In order to issue a direct command to a second person plural a perfective
verb stem with any obligatory classificatory prefixes and pronominal object
affixes inflected with -i is used, e.g.:(204) tl-Ø-i            ‘(You PL) Come!’
      un-Ø-i            ‘(You) Go!’
      obbià-Ø-i         ‘(You) Throw it!’These are obviously shortened forms from the hortative paradigm, namely
tline! ‘You (PL)/they should come!’, unine! ‘You (PL)/they should go!’, and
obbiàine! ‘You (PL)/they should throw!’.

-nam in the perfective and -m in the imperfective, e.g. fuela-nam ‘bathe (PFV,
M-form)’ and bu-m ‘hunt’ (IPFV, M-form). M-forms are used in purposive
serializations (see 11.1.6) and to form the verbal noun (see 8.7.2).","[340, 341]"
"
3.14.1.   SubjectMorphologically, the grammatical relation of subject is indexed on the verb by
a pronominal suffix in all finite verb forms:(212) haleb         -ta             te-s-e=a
      wild_boar     3SG.M-EMPH       come.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
      ‘a wild boar came and then she ...’ [Afoksitgabáam]Syntactically, the subject is the noun phrase which matches the person,
number, and in the third person also the gender value of the subject index on
the verb, in (212) haleb ta ‘the wild boar’. The subject noun phrase is not
overtly case-marked. The subject has special syntactic status in Mian because
it is the pivot of the switch-reference system of the language. Semantically,
subjects are typically topics and agents but subjects can also be experiencers
or expletives (i.e. dummy subjects in impersonal verbs). Subject suffixes are
discussed in 8.5.2.
164       3. Word classes and grammatical relations3.14.2.     ObjectMian has a single grammatical relation of object, which can be
morphologically indexed in different ways, so that the indexing patterns on the
verb do not correspond to the grammatical relations which can be established
on syntactic grounds. All objects can be modified, quantified, topicalized and
questioned. All objects can be relativized as well, but the relativization options
are subject to some restrictions for verbs which do not index their object. This
will be discussed in more detail below.
   In all cases, the object is the noun phrase which matches the person,
number, and in the third person also the gender value of the object index on
the verb. Object noun phrases are never overtly case-marked. The way objects
are indexed on the verb depends on lexical factors. There are four distinct
patterns of object indexation.
   First, the object can be marked by a pronominal prefix according to an
accusative pattern, e.g.:(213) no=i
      marsupial=PL.AN          ya-l-êt-n-e=ta
          PL.AN.O-kill.PFV-carry.PFV-SS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
          ‘he killed and brought/carried the marsupials and then ...’ [Crows]Semantically, objects indexed with a pronominal prefix mostly have the role
of patient.
    Second, the object can be marked by a classificatory prefix according to an
absolutive pattern, i.e. the object of a transitive verb (214) or the subject of an
intransitive verb (215) are indexed, e.g.:(214) ti=e                 báangkli=e
      blade=SG.M            stone_adze=SG.M          deb-êt-n-o=a

of theme or patient.
    Third, the object can be marked by a pronominal suffix according to an
indirective pattern. In the perfective, the suffix must be appended to -ûb’-
‘give’, which is compounded with another verb. In the imperfective,
suffixation is directly to the stem. For a detailed description, see 8.5.5.(216) unáng=o         baa-ˆb’-o-n-e=o=le
      woman=SG.F say.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.F.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=N2=TOP
      ‘and when he said to the woman’ [Pig story]Such objects most commonly have the role of recipient, benefactive,
malefactive, possessor, or experiencer. Finally, there are verbs which never
mark their object, e.g.:(217) unín=o        dowôn’-Ø-i=a
      food=N2       eat.PFV-DS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
      ‘I eat food and then someone else ...’ [Newlyweds]In this case, there is no indicator on the verb which makes the object relation
explicit, so the object is the noun phrase which is not indexed on the verb. In
most cases animacy differences (objects of verbs without object prefix are
overwhelmingly inanimate) and the semantics and context of the whole
utterance also help identify the object. Furthermore, many verbs without an
object prefix only occur with a relatively small range of possible object noun
phrases, as in the case of halbû’ ‘fold (IPFV)’, or even only with a single
possible object noun phrase (as in the case of êi ‘accumulate, impound
(water)’ or kè ‘cut (scraped taro) into slabs’, for which the objects can only
ever be aai ‘water’ and imen nini ‘scraped taro’, respectively.
    The absence of the prefix on these verbs has a syntactic consequence.
When a verb does not index its object relativization with a prenominal relative
clause is impossible and relativization with a head-internal relative clause is
only possible if the head is not omitted. This is illustrated in the following
examples. A prenominal relative clause is not allowed when the object is not
indexed, as in (218), but is fine when it is indexed, as in (219):(218) *n     fu-n-i                    unín=o         ayam=o=be
      1SG     cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ         food=N2        good=PRD=DECL
      Intended: ‘The food I’ve cooked is good.’(219) n        a-têm’-Ø-i                         naka=e

166    3. Word classes and grammatical relations       teke=o=be
       long=PRD=DECL
       ‘The man I see is tall.’In a head-internal relative clause the head must not be left out, if the verb does
not index the object, as in (220):(220) *n     fu-n-i=o                      ayam=o=be
      1SG     cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ=N2          good=PRD=DECL
      Intended: ‘What I’ve cooked is good.’Examples (221) and (222) show that a head-internal relative clause is possible
whether the overt object noun phrase is present or not, if the verb indexes its
object.(221) n       naka=e             a-têm’-Ø-i=e
      1SG      man=SG.M           3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=SG.M       teke=o=be
       long=PRD=DECL
       ‘The man I see is tall.’(222) n     a-têm’-Ø-i=e                                   teke=o=be
      1SG    3SG.M.O-see.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=SG.M              long=PRD=DECL
      ‘The one (M) I see is tall.’If the head is present, a head-internal relative clause is possible, even if the
verb does not index its object, as in (223):(223) n      unín=o     fu-n-i=o                        ayam=o=be
      1SG     food=N2 cook-REAL-1SG.SBJ=N2               good=PRD=DECL
      ‘The food I’ve cooked is good.’The evidence suggests that relativization is only allowed, if the relativized
object is present in the clause in some way or other, either as a prefix or as an
overt noun phrase. Thus, the syntactic effect correlates with a morphological
effect, namely the presence or absence of the prefix. As this is more a
morphological issue than a syntactic one I do not see a reason why the non-
subject noun phrases of verbs like fu ‘cook’, which do not cross-reference this
noun phrase with a prefix, should not be objects.
   To sum up, Mian has one grammatical relation of object, which can be
marked in three different ways. The object can also be not marked on the verb.

3.13.4.    The negative clitic =moThe negative clitic =mo is used in clauses that are negated with =ba ‘negation’
and prohibitives (see 8.6.7.6). It cannot be used in negated non-verbal
predications. =Mo typically encliticizes to the final constituent before the
verb. It can occur as a free word clause-initially. Examples of =mo in
declaratives can be found in 3.13.3 above. An example of the prohibitive is
given in (201):(201) mo         dob-ski

          ‘Do not keep turning him (a male child) around!’ [Crows]If the negated verb consists of a coverb and a function verb in case of a
function-verb construction, =mo attaches to the final constituent before the
whole predicate, which includes the coverb accompanying a function verb. An
example is:

      ‘I don’t know.’
3.13.5.       The interrogative clitic =mThe interrogative clitic =m is employed in polar questions (see 10.1.1). Like
negative =mo, interrogative =m typically encliticize to the final constituent
before the verb (or the coverb in case of a function-verb construction) but can
occur as a free word clause-initially. An example is (204):(204) m          wentê-b-eb=ta                           o-b-i

3.13.6.       The topic clitic =leThe topic clitic =le attaches to preceding noun phrases and adverbial and
medial clauses to indicate their topicality. The reader is referred to later
sections for examples and more detailed information on topicalized noun
phrases (6.9), topicalized medial clauses (11.3), and topicalized adverbial
clauses (13.2.5). An example of a topicalized noun phrase is (205):(205) memé               =le              ||   Sobining=e

noun phrases to express the notion that something which is expressed in the
same sentence or which is obvious from the context also applies to the referent
of the noun phrase. This is illustrated for a first and second person singular
pronoun in (206) and (207), respectively, and for a noun phrase in subject,
(206) and (207), and object position (208) and (209):(206) n=sa       klayâm             bl-Ø-i=be

          ‘they put the leaf (bag) too down between (them) as well’ [Danenok]Prima facie it might look that =sa ‘too’ is another suffix which derives
complex pronouns from simple ones, like -ta derives emphatic pronouns
(3.7.4). However, consider the following example which shows that if sa was
a pronoun suffix, we would not expect it to follow the topic clitic, which
marks noun phrases as topicalized not just noun:(210) y le        li=le=sa                      besa     y

3.13.8.     Interjections and formulaic utterancesInterjections are particles which express assent or dissent, emotional states,
and hesitation in speech. Due to the fact that interjections are usually uttered
with a marked intonation, and the difficulty of teasing apart lexical tone and
intonation, I will not mark tone on interjections. The inventory comprises:(211) ae, ai                               ‘yes’
      ayasi                                ‘expressing surprise or disbelief’
      ayo                                  ‘sorry (feeling regret or pity)’
      ba (< baa ‘say’)                     ‘ehm (hesitation in speech)’
      dowe                                 ‘boah man’
      ekskyus (from Tok Pisin)             ‘excuse me’
      klâye                                ‘well now’
      o                                    ‘oh’
      yait, yaiks (from Tok Pisin)         ‘yuck’
      yle, yle                           ‘well (also hesitation)’
      yeye                                 ‘no’The interjection ayo can only express regret and is not used for apologies.
   I think it is plausible that ba ‘ehm’ indicating hesitation goes back to the
verb stem baa ‘say (PFV)’. As bare verb stems are commonly used as
imperatives, it is conceivable that speakers used the imperative form baa
[mbà] ‘Say (it)!’ to “order themselves” to continue speaking. Synchronically,
however, the interjection ba is not pronounced with a pharyngealized /a/.
   In the eastern dialect, there are no interjections for the purpose of greeting
people. Instead whole formulaic sentences are exchanged. The following
patterns of question and answer are customary:Arriving party says:                         Customary answer:
bo y bliba? — ‘Are you (PL) there?’        ae, n y biobobe — ‘Yes, we are there.’
klayâm bieba? — ‘Are you well?’              ae, klayâm blibe — ‘Yes, I am well.’Departing party says:                        Customary answer:

kbo y tleba? — ‘You have come to         (ae,) y tlibe ‘(Yes,) I have come to this
this place.’                               place?’In the western dialect area, the form klayâmo ‘really good’ is commonly used
to say hello or bid farewell to somebody. Speakers of the eastern dialect do
not have this convention.","[185, 186, 187, 188, 189]"
"
3.14.3.   DitransitivesMian allows ditransitives to be derived from monotransitives in a highly
productive way. The three arguments are the subject and two objects. In
almost all cases, one of the objects is morphologically indexed by a prefix
(following an accusative or absolutive pattern) and one object is indexed by a
suffix (following an indirective pattern). For a detailed description of
ditransitives, see section 9.5.
Chapter 4
Gender
4.0.      IntroductionMian, like the closely related Ok languages Telefol and Tifal, has a category
‘gender’, i.e. nouns are lexically specified for the gender they are assigned to
and require the agreement patterns associated with their gender (Corbett 1991,
Aikhenvald 2000). Mian has four genders: Masculine (M), feminine (F), neuter
1 (N1), and neuter 2 (N2).
    Although gender is a nominal category, gender distinctions surface as
formal variation on agreeing categories, the agreement targets, which are
different from the noun. In Mian, agreeing categories within the noun phrase
are articles and determiners. Outside the noun phrase, pronominal affixes on
the verb, i.e. subject, object, and recipient markers, agree in gender with any
overtly realized arguments. In anaphoric agreement, pronouns and pronominal
affixes also agree in gender with a noun in a previously mentioned overt noun
phrase argument.
    Mian does not mark gender overtly on the noun, i.e. there is no nominal
affix indicating the gender of a noun. I follow Corbett (1991: ch. 6), who
treats genders as formally defined by sets of agreement markers and not by
formal properties of the noun. In order to be able to say that a language has
gender, some formal marker has to be present on at least one category
different from the noun, which systematically covaries with the gender of the
noun (Corbett 1991: 105).","[193, 194, 195]"

movement is towards a location, and in (14), it is towards a person:(13)     damìb       un-Ø-ib-bio=to

         ‘she was coming to her husband and then …’ [Flood]These locative adjuncts look like object noun phrases. However, in terms of
semantic roles these are always locatives. The main syntactic difference is that
objects are relativizable while locative adjuncts are not. Also there is a strong
tendency for all adjuncts to directly precede the verb, while objects of
transitive verbs are more mobile within the clause. Hence, I analyse locative
noun phrases as (locative) adjuncts of intransitive motion verbs rather than
core arguments (i.e. the objects) of what then would be a transitive motion
verb.","[362, 363, 364]"
"
2.8.1.   IntroductionAs my analysis of the tonal system of Mian is decidedly different from Smith
and Weston’s (1974a: 12-13, 25-28) approach, a few words about their work
are in order to orient the reader. Smith and Weston implicitly analyse Mian as
a syllable tone language with the restriction that contour tones are only ever
allowed on the final syllable of a word. Their treatment of the tonal phonology
includes indication of tones in phonemic and phonetic representations for
about 200 words (mainly nouns and adjectives). Further, there is a list of a
few, mainly near-minimal, tone pairs which lead them to establish four
phonemic tones, namely low, high, rising, and falling. The paper ends with a
short text of nine lines in which tonal specifications are included. In their
analysis, each vowel is a tone-bearing unit and is permitted to bear any one of
the phonemic tones. Recall from the section on vowel length (2.3) that Smith
and Weston treat long vowels as nuclei of two different adjacent syllables, so
long vowels effectively bear two tones. Smith and Weston (1974a) only
indicate tone in phonemic and phonetic representations, not in their
orthography, so none of their other publications on the Mian language, their
translation of the New Testament included, have tone specifications.
    There are two major problems with Smith and Weston’s analysis of Mian
as a syllable tone language.
    First, only a few of the logically possible tonal melodies occur on words
with one to three syllables. If a language that distinguishes four melodies was
a syllable tone language, the logically possible number of tone patterns would
be 4 for monosyllables, 16 for disyllables, and 64 for trisyllables. Even with
the restriction that contour tones can only appear on final syllables, the
logically possible number of tonal melodies by far exceeds the number of
actually attested patterns. We only need five melodies to account for the tonal
patterns on mono-, di- and trisyllables, namely L, H, LH, LHL, and HL.
    Second, the Smith and Weston analysis misses the important generalization
that the same tonal melody is found in /Lam/ [am] ‘house’ and /Libal/ [ial]
‘dust’, and likewise in /LHmn/ [mn] ‘string bag’ and /LHninin/ [ninín] ‘name’.
48    2. PhonologyThe tonal melody in the first pair is low (L), in the second rising (LH), the
only difference being that the domain over which the tone is spread in the
second member of each pair is a disyllabic word instead of a monosyllabic
one.
    In the following, I present my own analysis of Mian tone which tries to
address the two issues raised here, using the autosegmental approach to tone
that has been developed in the last two decades (see Leben 1973, Hyman
1978, Goldsmith 1990, Donohue 1997, Donohue 2003, Gussenhoven 2004).
In autosegmental phonology, suprasegmental features like tone, i.e. features
which behave independently of single segments, are taken out of the
traditional feature matrix characteristic of an SPE-type generative phonology
approach and put on a separate tier which is autonomous from the segmental
tier.
    In nouns and adjectives the function of tones is exclusively to distinguish
lexical meaning. In addition to this, verbs use tonal contrasts to mark many
(but not all) forms of the non-hodiernal past, where the subject marker bears a
high tone (see 2.8.5).
    There is a total of five tonal melodies: L, H, LH, LHL, and HL. Words are
lexically specified for one tonal melody. Stems can be unaccented or accented.
The former are either all L or all H, the latter have an accent which indicates
where a complex tonal melody, i.e. LH, LHL, or HL, is to be inserted. The
accent is the ‘anchor point’ for the melody (Hyman 1978, Donohue 2003,
Gussenhoven 2004).
    The tonal melodies L, H, and LH are very common in nouns and
adjectives, LHL and HL are quite rare. All tonal melodies occur on
monosyllabic and disyllabic nominal words. HL is rare in monosyllabic native
Mian nouns (and unattested in adjectives). An example is /HLf/ [f] ‘carrion’.
In monosyllabic Tok Pisin loans HL is quite common, e.g. /HLsu/ [sù] ‘shoe’
and /HLhas/ [hàs] ‘hat’. HL occurs occasionally in disyllabic nouns, e.g.
/HLusan/ [sàn] ‘tail’ and /HLmuku/ [mkù] ‘nose’.
    Verbs choose their tonal melody from a subset of the inventory available to
all other word classes, namely L, LHL, and HL. While LHL and HL are rare
in non-verb words, they are very common in verbs. H and LH, on the other
hand, are common in non-verb words but unattested in verbs.
    The tonal domain in verbs is generally larger as inflected verbs can easily
be five and more syllables long, whereas non-verb words are mainly mono- or
disyllabic.
    Regular accent placement for all stems is on the last stem syllable. Both
nominals and verbs show instances of accent placement which deviate from
this rule. Disyllabic nominals with a pharyngealized /a/ as the nucleus of the
first syllable, e.g. /LH |kawa/ ‘steel axe’, have the accent on the first syllable.
Accented verbs fall into two classes: (i) stem accented, e.g. /LHLhala/ ‘break
                                                                    2.8. Tone   49(PFV)’, and (ii) off-stem accented ones, e.g. /LHLlowon|/ ‘eat (PFV)’. Stem
accented verbs always have the accent on the last stem syllable, whereas in
off-stem accented verbs the accent is shifted to the next syllable to the right of
the stem, if (and only if) the verb stem occurs without any suffixal
morphology, in which case the inflection point regularly falls on the final stem
syllable. Deviant accent placement will be described in detail and illustrated
with example derivations in sections 2.8.2.3 (for non-verb words) and 2.8.4.4.
(for verbs).","[73, 74, 75]"

former typically precedes the latter. It is rare to have more than one adverbial
element in a single clause. An example is:(112) n          Febluali     dim      -ta        imín
      1SG         February     on       SG-EMPH     again          tl-aamab-i=be

9.10.6.    Position of nominal adjunctsIn most cases, nominal adjuncts occur immediately before the verb. An
example of a nominal adjunct is provided in (113). Others can be found in

          ‘This smells putrid.’The element fetàng ‘carrion smell’ is a regular compound consisting of fè
‘carrion’ and tang ‘smell’, yet is not an object noun phrase in this case but
rather a nominal adjunct to the verb. In Mian, objects can be followed by an
article or other pronominal determiner, they can be modified by a relative
clause and be topicalized. But a nominal adjunct like fetàng in (113) always
has to occur before the verb kun smell cannot be followed by any determiner.
Nor do they allow relativization or topicaliztion. Occasionally, nominal
adjuncts occur modified by an adjective, e.g. abén sm ‘big laughter’.","[394, 395]"

10.1.1.     Polar questions with the interrogative clitic =aPolar questions can involve verbal and non-verbal predicates. In the former
case, the illocutionary particle cliticizes to the verb, in the latter case, the
particle cliticizes to the non-verbal predicate term.
    The interrogative clitic =a is realized as =ya when following /a/, e.g.
naka=ya? ‘A man?’. After emphatic and restrictive pronouns, which end in
the emphatic suffix -ta, the interrogative clitic =a is also realized as =ya, but
here the preceding /a/ is deleted, e.g. kb-ta ‘you (M, EMPH)’ and kb-t=ya? ‘Is
it you?’, y-ta ‘only this (restrictive)’ and y-t=ya? ‘Is it only this?’
    In polar questions involving verbal predications the interrogative particle
cliticizes to the finite verb, as in the formulaic greeting in (1):(1)       klayâm             bi-Ø-eb=a?
          properly_good      stay.IPFV-IPFV-2SG.SBJ=Q
          ‘Are you (staying) well?’ [Observed]Constituent order does not change in questions. The declarative marker =be,
the emphatic/quotative marker =bo, or the exclamative marker =ble are simply
replaced by =a and the utterance receives a marked intonational contour as
opposed to the corresponding declarative sentence. Compare the polar
question in (2) and its declarative counterpart in (3):(2)       kb             mn=e         sm     gwáab

       ‘Your boy is still small.’The verb in (2) is pronounced bia. On this unusual contracted form, see
section 8.6.5, where irregularities in the inflection of the existential verb are
described.
   Optionally, polar questions can additionally contain the interrogative clitic
m (as opposed to negative mo with low tone). This typically encliticizes to
the final constituent before the predicate, as in (4), but can appear as a free
word if it occurs clause initially, as in example (15) below.(4)    ns      lo=m

       ‘Do you like this song?’As with the negative clitic mo, interrogative m may only occur once per
sentence. Thus, it may only appear once in any given clause chain, which
constitutes one sentence. Usually this would be the first clause to signal right
from the start that a question is coming:(5)    kbo       glol-amît=o=m             betelâ’-n-eb=a

       ‘Did you open and again close the window?’ [TMA Questionnaire,
       61]The interrogative marker =a can be combined with hortative verb forms in
order to query whether the addressee wants the speaker or the group of which
both speaker and addressee are members to perform a certain action:(6)    ayal=e            kemela-n-an=a?

       go.PFV-REAL-1PL.SBJ.HORT=Q
       ‘Shall we go?’ [Observed]In polar questions involving non-verbal predications the interrogative particle
attaches to either a noun (8), an emphatic pronoun (9), a distal demonstrative
(10), an adjective (11), or an adverb (12). The interrogative clitic m may not
be used. The range of possible hosts for the clitic is exactly co-extensive with
the range of word classes that can appear in the predicate slot in declarative
non-verbal clauses. Detailed information on non-verbal clauses can be found
in section 9.11.(8)    tíl=a?

sentence. In that case, there is no illocutionary clitic. This is illustrated for a
non-verbal predication in (14), and a sentence whose predicate is a finite verb,
in which case the interrogative clitic m is commonly used (15):(14)      yi=e              yi        bleka?

          (Lit: ‘Are you hearing as I’m saying, or?’) [Mianmin and Telefomin]Questions with bleka ‘or’ at the end are not leading but rather neutral polar
questions that introduce the (implied) negation of the proposition as a second
alternative, which is equally probable. Thus, the alternatives offered in (14)
are that the referent either is a wound or is not a wound. This is a type of polar
question because the appropriate responses are ‘yes’ or ‘no’.","[412, 413, 414, 415]"

11.5.        Medial verbs in utterance-final positionIt is quite a common phenomenon for Mian medial verbs to appear utterance-
finally in natural discourse. However, such utterances are usually not taken to
be grammatically complete sentences (Reesink 1987: 87). Their verbs are
clearly medial and not final because they are not interpreted with respect to
the moment of speaking (as final verbs are) but rather with respect to some
subsequent event which is not mentioned but implied or understood, since it is
obvious to the addressee from the context established by the situation in which
the utterance was made (Reesink 1983: 225).
    Although clause chains do not involve subordination (in the sense of
embedding) but rather co-subordination, the phenomenon under discussion
here is comparable to the widespread use of subordinate constructions as main
clauses in the world’s languages with particular semantic or discourse effects
(Evans 2007).
    Note that medial verbs in utterance-final position always take the medial
verb marker =ta rather than =a. An example is provided in (124):(124) n       sít=o            fubâ-n-i=ta
      1SG      tooth=PL.N1 wash-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
      ‘I’ll brush my teeth first and then I’ll …’ [Observed]Medial clauses as independent utterances are invariably understood as
desiderative statements about the future. Examples like (124) are abbreviated
468    11. Chaining constructionsversions of a full clause chain ending in a final verb inflected for irrealis. A
possible example is (125):(125) n        sít=o               fubâ-n-i=ta
      1SG       tooth=PL.N1         wash-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED       áam          un-aamab-i=be
       lie.SG.SBJ go.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I’ll brush my teeth and then go to bed.’A clause with a medial verb in final position, such as n sít=o fubâ-n-i=ta in
(124) above cannot be construed to mean: *‘I have brushed my teeth’, for
which an independent sentence has to be employed, as in (126):(126) n      sít=o            fubâ-Ø-i-o=be
      1SG     tooth=PL.N1      wash-REAL-1SG.SBJ-EP=DECL
      ‘I’ve brushed my teeth.’In (126), the final verb fubâiobe ‘I’ve washed (it)’ is zero-marked for realis
mood. As there is no alternative temporal reference point indicated, the default
interpretation is that the action took place immediately before the moment of
speaking.
    Another reason why utterance-final verbs in examples such as (124) above
should be treated as medial and not as final verbs is that the markers in the
pre-subject slot are interpreted as S/R markers. The S/R system limits the set
of available subjects for the implied event. For instance, the medial verb in
(124) fubânita is inflected with -n ‘SS.SEQ’. As the subject is first person
singular, the subject of the implied event must be coreferential. In all other
person-number combinations, -n only indicates sequentiality of events (127):(127) funa-n-eb=ta
      think.PFV-SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED
      ‘You think first and then (anybody)…’In the next example the medial verb is marked for DS. Consequently, the
subject of the implied event must be disjoint (regardless of person and number
specification of the subject):(128) aai=e            dowôn’-s-eb=ta
      water=SG.N1      eat.PFV-DS.SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED
      ‘You’ll drink water first and then someone else will…’
                                   11.6. Non-verbal clauses in clause chains   469It is possible for utterance-final medial verbs to also take one of the
illocutionary particles =be ‘Declarative’, =bo ‘Emphatic/quotative’, =ble
‘Exclamative’, =a ‘Question’, or =e ‘(Content) Question’ (which normally
only occur on final verbs) in addition to the medial verb clitic =ta. Again,
such structures are not grammatically complete utterances but imply an event
which must be readily retrievable from the linguistic or extra-linguistic
context. Examples (129) and (130) illustrate this for a declarative and an
interrogative sentence, respectively:(129) fanin-wal=i              wengsâng
      ancestor-PL=PL.AN        story        baa-n-ang-ge-n-i=ta=be
        say.PFV-REAL-IMMACC.SG.SBJ-say.PFV-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED=DECL
        ‘I am about to tell an ancestor story.’ (Implied: ‘and I will tell it
        now’)(130) sít=o           fubâ-n-eb=t=ya?
      tooth=PL.N1     wash-SEQ-2SG.SBJ=MED=Q
      ‘Will you brush your teeth first?’ (Implied, e.g. ‘and then go to bed’)
11.6.     Non-verbal clauses in clause chainsMost often the predicate of a non-verbal clause is followed by an illocutionary
particle which marks the end of independent and grammatically complete
utterance. However, non-verbal clauses also occur in clause chaining
constructions without an illocutionary clitic. Two examples are provided in
(131) and (132):(131) Kasening Milimab        n-ta            wengsâng       lo

Operator scope in clause chaining constructions
12.0.      IntroductionGrammatically marked categories such as tense, mood, polarity, illocutionary
force and the like, called operators by Foley and Van Valin (1984) and Foley
and Olsen (1985), differ in the scope they have in clause chaining structures.
The final verb is usually marked for such categories whereas the medial verbs
in the same clause chain depend on some of this information. While medial
verbs encode sequentiality or simultaneity of events and switches in subject
reference, they rely on final verbs for information on temporal location, mood,
and illocutionary force of the events denoted by the medial verbs. This is
typical for co-subordinated structures, such as clause chains (Reesink 1983,
Foley and Van Valin 1984).
    In this chapter, all operators that occur in final verbs in clause chaining
constructions and the scope they have over the clause chain will be examined
in some detail. The operators are ordered according to categories:        Illocutionary force   =be                ‘Declarative’
                              =ble               ‘Exclamative’
                              =bo                ‘Quotative, emphatic’
                              =a                 ‘Question’
                              =e                 ‘(Content) Question’
                              =o ~ =e            ‘Hortative’
        Polarity              =ba                ‘Negation’

       ‘the story of Fitibkanib and Dimosson’ (lit. ‘Fitibkanib, Dimosson
       their story) [Fitibkanib and Dimosson]Two issues remain to be addressed in connection with possessive
constructions in Mian. The first problem is how far possessive constructions
can be straightforwardly distinguished from compounding. The second issue
has to do with constituent order in the noun phrase, especially with the
evidence for assuming both a possessor slot and a prenominal adjective slot.
    In some cases the distinction between a possessive construction and a
compound is fuzzy. Consider the example al atosîn [bowels bit(s)]. Would
this be better glossed as ‘bit(s) of bowels’ or as ‘bowel bit(s)’? While both
analyses seem possible, it is noticeable that in al atosîn the first noun appears
without an article or any other adnominal pronoun, which make the whole
construction look like two compounded stems. Hence, I opt for the compound
analysis here. If the first element in a complex noun phrase appears without an
article (and without any other pronominal element), the construction is a
compound (i.e. al atosîn ‘bowel bit(s)’). If the first noun is followed by an
article, the construction is possessive (i.e. al=o atosîn ‘bit of bowels’). See
Healey (1965a: 10-11) for a description of a similar problem in Telefol. Tonal
evidence supports this analysis. Compounds constitute a single tonal domain.
The tone on the compound is a composite melody consisting of a sequence of
the respective stem melodies and is assigned to the compound as a whole. In a
possessive construction, possessor and possessed constitute two distinct tonal
domains.
    As far as the ordering of possessor and possessed is concerned, there is
syntactic evidence that the position of the possessor must be to the left of the
possessed noun with all its adjectival modifiers, rather than just to the left of
the noun. Although the standard word order in modified noun phrases is noun
head followed by one or more postnominal modifiers, the adjectival modifiers
sin ‘old’ and memâ ‘new’, tend to occur before the head noun:(60)   n            sin    fanin=e

that the possessor slot immediately precedes the noun would be inaccurate.
Rather, the possessor slot immediately precedes the noun with all its
modifiers.","[244, 245, 246]"

9.11.4.     Negation in non-verbal clausesNon-verbal clauses are negated like clauses with a finite verb with the
negation clitic =ba. This attaches directly to the predicate term. Unlike verbal
predications, the negation clitic =mo, which attaches to the constituent
immediately before the predicate, cannot be used in negated non-verbal
clauses.
   The following examples show negation of non-verbal predications
expressing identity (135), a property (136), and possession (137).

9.12.     Reciprocal constructionsMian has two constructions for describing reciprocal events: (a) a bare
reciprocal, in which verbs with a plural subject are most likely to be
interpreted reciprocally and (b) a dedicated reciprocal construction which can
only be used for reciprocal events.
376       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause9.12.1.     The bare reciprocal constructionLike many languages, Mian has a bare reciprocal construction, in which verbs
with a plural subject are most likely to be interpreted reciprocally. Such verbs
have also been called ‘naturally’ reciprocal verbs in the literature (Kemmer
1993). An example is given in (139):(139)           wéng=o            o-b-io=be
      3PL.AN     language=N2       say.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
      ‘They are talking (lit. saying language).’ [MPI reciprocals, 1]
9.12.2.     The sese-constructionThe dedicated reciprocal construction involves the reciprocal suffix -sese. The
only function of this construction is to encode reciprocal situations. It is very
rare in the spontaneous corpus. Reciprocal semantics are entailed:(140)           i-nâ’-sese-bl-Ø-io=be
      3PL.AN     PL.AN.O-hit.PFV-RECP-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
      ‘They are hitting each other (i.e. are engaged in reciprocal hitting).’Reciprocants have to be animate. Encoding of reciprocal events involving
inanimate participants is unattested in Mian.
     The participants in a reciprocal event occupy the same set of argument
positions they would in a normal clause, i.e. they have to be (i) subjects and
(ii) objects. The object can be indexed either by a prefix or a suffix depending
on the argument structure of the verb.
     In example (141) the reciprocants are subject and object (marked by a
prefix):(141)           ya-têm’-sese-bl-Ø-io=be
      3PL.AN     PL.AN.O-see.PFV-RECP-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
      ‘They are exchanging glances with each other.’In the following examples, reciprocants are encoded as subject and object
(marked with a suffix) with different semantic roles, namely goal (142),
possessor/benefactive (143), and possessor/malefactive (144):

       ‘They burn (lit. set fires to) each other’s houses.’The existential auxiliary can be regularly inflected to locate the reciprocal
event at different points in the past:(145) 

       PL.AN.O-hit.PFV-RECP-AUX.IPFV-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL

       PL.AN.O-hit.PFV-RECP-AUX.IPFV-REAL-2/3PL.AN.SBJ-HPST=DECL
       ‘Yesterday they were hitting each other.’The dedicated reciprocal construction has several noteworthy features.
378       9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseFirst, the existential auxiliary bi~bl ‘be there, stay, exist’ agrees with the
whole set of reciprocants.
    Second, the reciprocal suffix -sese occurs immediately after the verb stem
and before the auxiliary. This is peculiar because in Mian verbs which appear
with an auxiliary the auxiliary immediately follows the stem of the lexical
verb without the possibility of any intervening suffixal TAM morphology.
This suggests that the sese-construction is the result of a syntactically more
complex construction in which constituent parts have been fused together.
    Third, the whole set of reciprocants is cross-referenced on the verb with an
object prefix or suffix, which are in the plural in examples (140) to (146).
    It must however be pointed out that all of the above examples are strongly
dispreferred for situations with just two participants. In a reciprocal situation
with only two participants the non-subject reciprocant is cross-referenced by a
suffix in the singular:(147) unáng           asú    uláab=i              te

          ‘Two women meet and while they are talking they are touching each
          other.’ [MPI reciprocals, 3]In the case of just two participants, the non-subject cross-referencing suffix
has to be singular. In this situation, Mian merges the agents through plural
subject marking whereas it keeps the patients apart through singular object
marking.","[400, 401, 402, 403, 404]"

 Neuter 2                         =o                     am ‘house’The animate plural article =i is realized as =ei if it cliticizes to a word ending
in a high vowel /i/ or /u/. The following examples may suffice: /Hsnabi/
‘crocodile’ and /Hsnabi=i/ ‘(the) crocodiles’; /Lumasou/ ‘fish species’ and
/umasou=i/ ‘(the) umasou fish’, but /naka=i/ ‘(the) men’ not */naka=i/.
   Consider example (60) where three nouns – each with a pronominal article
– appear as subject, object, and possessor:(60)     nakamîn=e          imen=o         éil=e
         man=SG.M           taro=PL.N1     pig=SG.M         wen-ha-b-e=a

         ‘While a pig was eating a man’s taro, the man…’ [Pig story]The formatives under discussion are articles rather than overt number/gender
markers because they also indicate referentiality. The noun without the article
occurs in contexts in which the noun is used non-referentially, that is in any of
the following contexts:-     in the citation form, e.g. nakamîn ‘man, brother’, éil ‘pig’, imen ‘taro’,
      sók ‘rain’, kukub ‘way, custom’.
-     in generic object arguments in the citation form of (some) transitive
      verbs, e.g. as hakalin [wood break.IPFV.VN] ‘(activity of) breaking
      wood’
-     in first elements in N-N compounds, e.g. wan-am [bird-house] ‘bird
      blind’
-     in generic terms used to classify animals and plants, e.g. wan ‘bird’ in
      wan tolim [bird eagle] ‘New Guinea eagle (sc. Harpyopsis
      novaeguineae)’
                                                               3.3. Articles   111-   in non-verbal predications about identity, e.g. tíl=o=be
    [dog=PRD=DECL] ‘it’s a dog’
-   under negation, e.g. imen bl-im [taro exist-NEG] ‘there’s no taro’,
    yi=ba=be [wound=NEG=DECL] ‘it’s not a wound’This suggests that the article does not behave like overt gender or noun class
markers in many Australian or Bantu languages, in which a noun either
invariably has a certain marker or invariably lacks it, but rather functions as an
article marking the noun as definite-referential or indefinite-referential but is
left out if the noun is used non-referentially. However, there is a tendency to
leave out the article if the noun is inanimate even if it is used referentially.
    Mian does not mark its nouns overtly for gender but rather requires the
article to agree in gender with its noun. There is evidence that the article is on
the way of becoming a purely classificatory gender marker through the
extension of the form with article to non-referential contexts. Although the
form without article is the preferred choice under negation, as in
as bl-im [wood exist-NEG] ‘there’s no wood’, one also finds as=e bl-im
[wood=ARTICLE exist-NEG] with the same meaning. Greenberg (1978) shows
that across languages the definite article often winds up as a gender marker on
the noun after going through a grammaticalization process during which it is
increasingly used both as a definite article, meaning ‘the N’, and an indefinite
specific article, meaning ‘a specific N’ or ‘a certain N’. When the use of the
article becomes a function of the syntactic construction in which the noun
appears (e.g. negation), the original contrast between the form with article and
the form without article is lost and the distinction becomes redundant. At this
point the form with article usually starts to spread to all contexts. If this form
becomes universal in the language, the former article has become a gender
marker on the noun (Greenberg 1978: 63).
    Articles can follow all nouns, i.e. common nouns, proper names, dyads,
and temporal and verbal nouns (see section 3.1). Articles can also follow finite
verbs in head-internal relative clauses and adverbial clauses. In head-internal
relative clauses (61), the article agrees in number and gender with the noun. In
adverbials (62), the article is invariably =o. Square brackets indicate clause
boundaries:(61)   [no=i                    ya-l-êb

       [Dimosson]Adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses are discussed in 13.2 and
13.3 under embedding.
   Articles can be distributed throughout the noun phrase and follow the noun
and any adjectival modifiers. They can also follow numerals (see 6.3 for
details on modified and quantified noun phrases):(63)   tíl=e           milil=e          sm=e
       dog=SG.M        black=SG.M       big=SG.M
       ‘a/the big, black dog’In (63), referentiality, number and gender are marked per article =e on the
noun and on each adjectival modifier. More common in natural discourse,
however, is to have only one article for the whole noun phrase, namely
following the rightmost modifier, for example:(64)   tíl     milil     sm=e
       dog black         big=SG.M
       ‘a/the big, black dog’I analyse the article as a clitic rather than a suffix for the following reasons:
(a) Apart from nouns, articles can attach to adjectives and numerals and also
to verbs in adverbial clauses and head-internal relative clauses. (b) The
coordinating clitic =a (presumably a shortened form of eka ‘and’) usually
intervenes between the noun and the article in the last constituent of a
sequence of coordinate noun phrases:(65)   naka=i=a           unáng=a=i
       man=PL.AN=and      woman=and=PL.AN
       ‘(the) men and women’ [Dimosson]Articles are segmentally identical to the third person forms of the free
pronouns series, from which they are probably derived. Synchronically,
however, they differ from the pronouns in their suprasegmentals. While all
free pronoun forms are lexically specified for a high tone, articles are subject
                                                                3.3. Articles   113to suprasegmental phonological erosion, i.e. they are on the way to becoming
toneless. As lexical tone spreads to any toneless affixes and clitics, the
phonetic pitch value of the article depends on the lexical tone specification of
the noun (see 2.8.3.2).
    I assume three stages in this grammaticalization scenario. Contemporary
Mian is moving from stage (b) to stage (c):(66)     (a) naka  (lit. ‘man he’) > (b) naka= > (c) naka-e ‘a/the man’In the first stage (a), nouns were followed by a free pronoun which was
realized as a phonologically independent word. Synchronically, articles are
generally not realized as independent phonological words anymore, although
this still happens occasionally in very old speakers (over 80 years).
    In the second stage (b), the article encliticizes to the noun. Concomitantly,
suprasegmental attrition sets in.
    At the final stage (c), the vocalic formative will have developed into a
toneless nominal suffix.
    As the article is part of the phonological nominal word (even in very
careful speech), it is clear that the language has moved beyond the first stage.
However, one finds the pronunciations [na.ka. ] and [na.ka.] ‘a/the man’. In
the former, the article has its own high tone, in the latter it is toneless and low
tone is spread from the noun to the article. Articles which retain their own
high tone (characteristic of the second stage) and ones which are toneless
(characteristic of the third stage) occur in free variation.","[136, 137, 138, 139]"
"
11.1.1.     Core-level serial verb constructionsCore SVCs consist of several verb stems which are concatenated to form a
temporally iconic sequence of predications, i.e. the events denoted by the
verbs within a SVC take place in the order they are uttered. The attested
maximum is a serialization of eight verbs, cf. example (14) below. In core
SVCs, each verb is phonologically independent, i.e. it constitutes its own
domain with respect to tone assignment.
   SVCs at core level are of low semantic integration. Every verb stem
constitutes a predicate and each predicate can have its own objects. In other
words, each verb stem in a SVC takes its own argument structure into the
SVC and they can either exist next to each other or be intertwined, i.e. verbs in
a SVC can – and commonly do – share object arguments. The stem aspect of
the verbs in a core SVC can vary freely. Core SVCs are semantically
compositional and the degree of lexicalization is very low.",[432]

11.2.2.     Medial versus final verbsMany Papuan languages that have clause chaining and S/R systems display a
difference in morphological complexity of medial verbs compared to
sentence-final verbs, which appear as the predicate of the last clause in a
clause chain. Compared to final verbs, medial verbs are commonly
morphologically impoverished. See Roberts (1997) for a typological survey of
S/R systems in New Guinea languages.
    In the simplest case, medial verbs are only marked for co-reference of
subject, not for tense or person/number of the subject. The following example
from Usan (Numugenan family, Madang Province) (Reesink 1987) is found in
Reesink (1983: 217 and pers. comm.):(36)      ye      nam     su-ab      is-omei
          I       tree    cut-SS     go_down-1SG.FAR.PAST
          ‘I cut the tree and (I) went down.’Often the marker has additional temporal meaning, ‘portmanteau-ed’ into the
same formative, e.g. sequential or simultaneous. This is the case in Fasu (West
Kutubuan family, Southern Highlands Province) (Loeweke and May 1980)
and Kalam (Kalam family, Madang Province) (Pawley 1966, Pawley 1987,
Pawley 1993). The following example is from Kalam (Pawley 1993: 101):(37)      kwt     d-y                  nwp pk-p-yn
          stick   hold-SS.PRIOR        him hit-PFV-2SG
          ‘You hit him with a stick.’ (lit. ‘You took a stick and hit him.’)
                          11.2. Medial verb morphology and clause chaining   423The DS-forms of medial verbs are usually more complex. They can carry a
subject marker, which indicates DS while the SS form is zero, e.g. in Fore
(Gorokan family, Eastern Highlands) (Scott 1978), or they can have an
anticipatory subject marker which indicates person and number of the
following subject, as in Hua (Gorokan family, Eastern Highlands) (Haiman
1980: 187-189).
    In other languages, one finds portmanteaux DS markers, for example in
Kobon (Davies 1981) and Usan, where the DS marker also contains
information on subject person and number without this being segmentable as a
distinct morpheme. The following Usan example is from Reesink (1983: 218
and pers. comm.):(38)   ye      nam      su-ine         is-orei
       I       tree     cut-1SG.DS     go_down-3SG.FAR.PAST
       ‘I cut the tree (and it went) down.’Medial verbs can have separate suffixes for disjoint reference and for subject
person and number, as for example in Kalam (Pawley 1993: 94):(39)   an     ag-e-k                   g-a-k?
       who    say-DS.PRIOR-3SG         do-3SG-PST
       ‘Who told him to do it?’ (lit. ‘Who said and he did it?’)So in these typical examples of S/R in Papuan languages we find a situation
where medial verbs are different from final verbs in that not all medial verbs
are marked for subject person and/or subject number (e.g. SS medial verbs
often occur without an affix cross-referencing the subject), they often cannot
be marked for various categories, such as irrealis mood or absolute tense, i.e. a
tense category which has the moment of speaking as its deictic centre (Comrie
1985), and the formatives that medial and final verbs allow are formally and
functionally distinct.
   In Mian we find a less grammaticalized S/R system, characteristic of
languages of the West Papuan Highlands, e.g. Dani (Bromley 1981) and
Kapauku (Ekagi) (William Foley, pers. comm.). Mian also makes frequent use
of clause chaining in discourse, but here the situation is different in that
medial verbs resemble final verbs much more than in the languages above.
Mian medial verbs:-   convey aspectual information through the aspectual stem
    distinction unless the verb is trans-aspectual.
-   are always marked for subject and any additional argument(s) in
    the same way as if the verb occurred in an independent sentence.
424       11. Chaining constructions-     take a range of markers in their pre-subject suffix slot which
      convey temporal and S/R information. These are homophonous
      with a subset of those found in the pre-subject slot in final verbs
      (see 8.6.1 and 11.2.6.2).
-     can be marked for the tense categories ‘General past’ and
      ‘Hesternal past’ to locate an event in the (general) past or
      yesterday, respectively.
-     are directly inflected or serialized with an auxiliary stem of the
      existential verb. Medial verbs can occur with a proper subset of the
      auxiliary stems found in final verbs.","[448, 449, 450]"
"
8.5.4.1. Classificatory prefixesA sizeable subset of the verbal vocabulary requires a classificatory prefix, e.g.
dob-ò/— ‘take (M-class object)’ or ol-ò/— ‘take (plural inanimate objects)’.
These classificatory prefixes are formally fully distinct from the object
prefixes used for the verbs, which indicate their object accusatively and the
classification system relevant for these prefixes cross-cuts the gender system.
Classificatory prefixes are dealt with in detail in chapter 5. Here, I confine
myself to providing two examples illustrating the absolutive nature of the
classificatory prefixes, i.e. the object of a transitive verb (67) or the subject of
an intransitive verb (68) are indexed:(67)     báangkli=e            dob-ò-n-o=a
         stone_adze=SG.N1 3SG.M_CL.O-take.PFV-SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
         ‘she took the báankli adze and then ...’ [Afoksitgabáam]

       ‘Dabein came falling down (i.e. from the sky) and ...’ [Sofelok, 1]
8.5.4.2. Stem apophony in perfective ‘cut and break’-verbsFive perfective-only ‘cut and break’-verbs indicate the number of the
(inanimate) object through stem apophony on an absolutive basis. The
alternation is always between /a/ for a singular object and // for a plural
object. All of these verbs are compounds consisting of one of the five ‘cut and
break’ verbs wà ‘cut’, dà ‘break off’, bà ‘cut across’, hà ‘cut alongside, break
apart’, or tà ‘cut off’, and a semantically more general verb, e.g. -lò ‘hit’ or
-tlâa’ ‘remove’, for example, wa-lò ‘cut (singular object)’ in (69) and we-lò
‘cut (plural object)’ in (70).(69)   db=e              wà-lò-n-i=be
       seed=SG.N1         cut.SG.O-hit.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I cut off a seed.’(70)   db=o              wè-lò-n-i=be
       seed=PL.N1         cut.PFV.PL.O-hit.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I cut off seeds.’The number of verbs which obligatorily agree with their object in number only
is quite small and semantically very homogeneous. Further examples are: halò
‘cut, break (singular wooden object)’ and helò ‘cut, break (plural wooden
object)’, batlâa’ ‘break, tear apart (vine, leaf, tree bark)’ and betlâa’ ‘break,
tear apart (plural vines, leaves, tree bark)’.
    If a verb which indicates the number of its object by stem apophony is
ambitransitive and the object of the transitively used verb becomes the subject
of the intransitively used verb, as in (71). Stem apophony reflects the number
of the subject.(71)   as=e            hà-lò-s-e=a
       tree=SG.N1      break.PFV.SG.SBJ-hit.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.N1.SBJ=MED
       ‘The tree broke (down) and then someone…’ [Flood]In this case, both stem apophony in the verb and the subject suffix indicate
properties of the subject. Number is expressed in the stem and person,
number, and gender are expressed in the subject suffix.
                                                      8.5. Argument marking    2698.5.5.    Object suffix (indirective alignment)Recipients are marked on the ditransitive verbs -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ and -ka-
‘give (IPFV)’ with a suffix. Both belong to the class of verbs which
obligatorily cross-reference and classify the theme object, i.e. the gift, with a
classificatory prefix. In addition, they also take a suffix that cross-references
the recipient (plus another suffix for the subject). While many Papuan
languages display secundative alignment for the recipient in ditransitives, they
treat the recipient like the object of a monotransitive verb, the alignment for
the recipient argument in Mian is indirective, i.e. recipients are marked
different from objects of monotransitive verbs.
    Thus, -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ and -ka- ‘give (IPFV)’ are examples of triple
agreement, i.e. the indexing of subject and two objects by affixes on the verb.
Triple agreement is a typologically rare phenomenon, both in Papuan
languages and world-wide .
    An example of -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is provided in (72):(72)     n      naka=e          éil=o
         1SG     man=SG.M        pig=SG.F         om-ûb’-a-Ø-i-bio=be
         3SG.F_CL.O-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-REAL-1SG.SBJ-GPST=DECL
         ‘I gave the sow to the man.’As in transitive clauses, none of the overt arguments n ‘I’, naka=e ‘the man’,
or éil=o ‘the sow’ in this example are marked for their syntactic role within
the clause. Construal of grammatical roles proceeds by aligning the overt noun
phrases with the agreeing pronominal affixes on the verb. In this case, n ‘I’ is
the subject because -i ‘first person singular subject’ is in the subject slot of the
verb, and the noun phrases naka=e ‘the man’ and éil=o ‘the sow’ appear in a
double object construction. Each object is indexed in a different way on the
verb, naka=e ‘the man’ as the recipient object and éil=o ‘the sow’ as the
theme object.
   Like subject marking, recipient marking is suffixal and it is likewise
obligatory. Unlike subject and object marking, however, recipient marking is
sensitive to whether the marking suffix occurs in imperfective or perfective
verb forms (see below). The set of recipient suffixes occurring with -ûb’-
‘give (PFV)’ is summarized in table 8.4. Grey areas indicate the neutralization
of a gender contrast. For ease of exposition, only the ûb-paradigm, i.e. the
suffixes following -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’, is given here. Further below these forms
are contrasted with the forms from the ka-paradigm, used in the imperfective.
Recipient arguments of -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ are always animate.

         ‘They habitually give (a few) vomit bags to us (i.e. on the
         mission plane).’The set of recipient cross-referencing suffixes for -ka- ‘give (IPFV)’ is
summarized in table 8.5. For ease of comparison, I repeat the recipient forms
in the perfective in this table. Both series have the typical TNG reflexes /n/
and /k/ the first and second singular forms (Foley 2000: 362, Ross 2005: 32).
Grey areas indicate the neutralization of a gender contrast. Recipient
arguments of -ka- ‘give (IPFV)’ and of -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ are always animate.
    The imperfective root /ka/ might have some historical relation to the proto-
Engan (TNG) verbal beneficiary suffix *-ka. This form could be cognate with
the third person recipient stem kálaa ‘give to him/her/them’ in Kewa (Franklin
1971: 66) and has possible reflexes in other TNG ‘give’ verbs (Reesink, in
prep.).

While perfective -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is an underived ditransitive verb in
contemporary Mian and obligatorily index both theme and recipient, -ka-
‘give (IPFV)’ is apparently derived from the transitive verb -ka ‘put’, which
only indexes the object with a classificatory prefix but does not have a
recipient suffix:(75)     imen=e           ob-ka-bina-b-i=be

8.5.5.2. Compounds with -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ in the perfectiveThe ditransitive verb -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ is productively used in a compound
with another verb stem as a valency-increasing device with an applicative-like
function. The use of ‘give’ as a valency-increasing device is attested in a
number of TNG languages. It is a recurrent pattern in TNG languages that
they use compounds or serializations with ‘give’ to express recipient or
benefactive arguments (Foley 1986, Foley 2000, Reesink in prep.), for
example Kewa (Franklin 1971), Menya (Whitehead 2004), and Tairora
(Vincent 1973).4
   In Mian, almost all intransitive and transitive verbs can be compounded
with -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ in order to introduce another participant into the
argument structure of the verb through the recipient suffix on the ‘give’-verb.
This type of compounding is only used in the perfective. The spectrum of
semantic roles that can be mapped onto this additional argument is quite wide
and includes not only recipients but also benefactives, possessors, and goals of
ballistic motion, depending on the semantics of the verb serialized with ‘give’.
274    8. Verb morphology   The use of -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ in a compound with an intransitive and a
transitive verb is illustrated in examples (80) and (81), respectively.(80)   un-ûb’-ke-n-amab-i=be

6.4.      Attributive possessionAs we are dealing with noun phrase structure here, this section is confined to
attributive possession. For a description of predicative possession, see section
9.11.3.
    Mian has one construction for encoding attributive possession in which the
possessor precedes the possessed. This is the typical order for verb-final
languages (Dryer 2007: 62). The possessor slot can be filled either by a
possessive pronoun or by a full noun phrase.
    In the most common and least complex case the possessor slot is filled by a
possessive pronoun. The forms are set out in the tables 6.2 and 6.3. The free
pronoun forms have been included to illustrate the obvious formal relations
between the two pronoun series. Distinct forms for the possessive and the free
pronoun series are given in boldface. Grey areas indicate the neutralization of
a gender contrast.",[242]

        ‘She gave birth to a boy and so she is crying.’However, if the subject of the marked clause is anything but first person
singular and the verb is marked -n, the subject in the reference clause can
either have co- or disjoint reference. For example in (70) the subject of the
marked clause is co-referent with the subject of the reference clause, namely
the mother of the child that she has given birth to:

       ‘She gave birth to a boy and she is crying.’But (71) is equally acceptable, where -n indicates only that events proceed

       cry.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘She gave birth to a boy and he is crying.’If we now imagine that the mother of the new-born is talking, DS marking
invariably indicates disjoint reference and SS marking co-reference, as
illustrated by examples (72) and (73):(72)   mn=e           do-fâ-s-i=a

       ‘I gave birth to a boy and I am crying’One could object that all of these examples are elicited. Reesink (1983: 241-
242) rightly states that it is important to study S/R behaviour in coherent
discourse rather than in isolated, and even worse, elicited, examples. It is well-
known that SS marking in Papuan languages with a S/R system can be
seemingly inconsistent. This can be the case if the reference clause is
providing background information, for example in temporal clauses and
clauses which describe meteorological conditions, or physiological or psycho-
                           11.2. Medial verb morphology and clause chaining        441logical states. Reesink (1983: 240) points out that S/R marking proceeds with
respect to topicality hierarchies. In other words, the topic-hoods of certain
subjects may override the system, thus resulting in seemingly inconsistent SS
marking. Consequently, a clause or even clauses with less topical subjects can
be skipped and SS marking is calculated with respect to the clause in which
the topic re-occurs (see also Farr 1999: 228). Mian, however, allows SS
marking before clauses providing background information, even if the topic of
the first clause is never mentioned again in the rest of the text, as in (74). The
embedded adverbial clause is bracketed:(74)    a.   yoma-n-e=ta
             beget-SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED        b.   [naka=i             utl-Ø-ib=o]

             3PL.AN name=N2 PL.F_CL.O-put-SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
             ‘he begot (children), [when the people grew up,] they assumed
             names and then…’ [Dimosson]In the first marked clause (line a) of this text excerpt, the subject is the male
protagonist and it would be plausible to assume that the bracketed adverbial
clause (line b) was skipped and SS marking was interpreted with respect to the
clause following the adverbial, if the man re-occurred as topic. But he drops
out of the discourse as a topic and is never mentioned again. That marking
with -n is nonetheless possible corroborates the fact that -n in medial verbs is a
more general marker of sequentiality except where the subject of the marked
clause is first person singular. In this case, -n unequivocally indicates event
sequentiality and SS.
   If we assume that a central function of an S/R system is to help with
reference resolution in potentially ambiguous situations, the restrictions of the
Mian S/R system are peculiar because – from a functional perspective – such
restrictions do not seem to make much sense. After all, S/R morphology is
redundant when either of the subjects is first or second person because in these
cases, disjoint reference is obvious to the speaker.
   Haiman and Munro write:    [Switch reference] is redundant where either subject [i.e. in the marked or
    the reference clause – SF] is first or second person, and necessary where
    both subjects are third person. We may therefore expect to find languages in
    which switch-reference is limited to the third person (Haiman and Munro
    1983: xi).
442    11. Chaining constructionsExamples of languages in which S/R is only obligatory in the third person or
even restricted to third person, are Gokana (Comrie 1983), Kaingáng
(Wiesemann 1982) and Yup’ik (Woodbury 1983). Whether these are
uncontroversial examples of S/R languages3 is not important here, but clearly,
if S/R is fully functional only for certain person-number combinations, one
would not expect this to be the case in the first person singular, where it is
functionally unnecessary for reference resolution.
   On the other hand, Mian can afford to renounce some of the
disambiguation work in reference tracking normally done by a S/R system for
two reasons:(a) all medial verbs are obligatorily marked for person and number of the
subject, and(b) Mian uses gender as a reference-tracking device, and the cross-referencing
subject markers index the gender of the subject.","[465, 466, 467, 468]"

1.2.2.    Previous linguistic research on the Ok languagesEven today Ok remains a family of little known languages. Research on the
Ok languages was mainly conducted in the 1960s and 1970s by both linguists
and missionaries. Alan Healey’s dissertation (Healey 1964a) is a comparative
study of the Ok language family. He explores the historical development of
the Ok languages and reconstructs Proto Mountain Ok and Proto Lowland Ok
as common ancestor languages. Healey also provides short sections on Proto
Ok and Archaic Ok, in which he indicates the direction that a reconstruction of
the proto language would have to take. Although Healey does not attempt to
reconstruct tone for lack of reliable information, he highlights conspicuous
tone parallels for Mian, Telefol, and Tifal (Healey 1964a: 128 and table 3).
6      1. The language and its speakers    Voorhoeve’s (2005) genealogy is wider in scope. He examines the genetic
relationship of the Asmat-Kamoro, Awyu-Dumut and Ok families based on
regular sound correspondences in the daughter languages. A study of the
genetic relatedness of Oksapmin, which to date has been classified as an
isolate, and the Ok languages can be found in Loughnane and Fedden (2011).
    Previous linguistic work on Mian was done by Jean Smith and Pamela
Weston of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL), two missionaries who
lived in Sokamin for 15 months and in Telefomin for several years where they
worked with visiting and live-in Mian speakers (my main consultant Kasening
Milimab among them). Smith and Weston published a two-part sketch
grammar, dealing with the phonology and the morphosyntax of the language,
respectively (Smith and Weston 1974a, 1974b). Apart from this sketch, Smith
(1977) published an article on sentence structure, and Weston (1977) one on
interrogatives. Smith and Weston (n.d.-a) is a compilation of this material with
some additional information on Mian discourse. Smith and Weston (n.d.-b) is
a sizable wordlist, which comprises approximately 2,000 entries, each with a
Mian headword and Tok Pisin and English glosses. Apart from indication of
word class, the wordlist contains no further grammatical information.
    Although Smith and Weston were not formally trained linguists and their
linguistic work has always been directed to the end of translating the complete
New Testament into Mian (Smith and Weston 1986), their grammar sketch,
i.e. Smith and Weston (1974a, 1974b), was invaluable as a starting point for
my own linguistic analysis of Mian.
    The only other Ok language described in greater detail is Telefol. Phyllis
and Alan Healey did research on Telefol phonology (Healey 1964b), noun
phrase (Healey 1965a), clause structure (Healey 1965b), verb phrase (Healey
1965c), and clause chaining constructions (Healey 1966). In addition to that,
the Healeys published an excellent dictionary (Healey and Healey 1977).
Their findings have never been published in a single volume.
    Materials on Tifal phonology can be found in Steinkraus (1963, 1969),
materials on Tifal grammar in Healey and Steinkraus (1972) and in Boush
(1975). For information on Faiwol, see Mecklenburg and Mecklenburg (1969,
1977) and Mecklenburg (1974).","[31, 32]"

8.3.3.      Trans-aspectual verbsFor trans-aspectual (or aspect-neutral) verbs, stems are formally identical, i.e.
a contrast between imperfective and perfective aspect is not shown by the
stem. Consider the following two examples:(29)              bín=o        we-b-o=be
         3SG.F     floor=N2     sweep-IPFV-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
         ‘She is sweeping the floor.’(30)             bín=o         we-n-o=be
         3SG.F    floor=N2      sweep-REAL-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
         ‘She swept the floor.’In both examples the stem is we ‘sweep’. Trans-aspectual verb stems can be
used in the imperfective and the perfective, e.g. they can be combined with
imperfective aspect morphology, such as -b ‘Imperfective’ in (29), and also
with the realis suffix -n in (30), which can be directly appended to a verb stem
only in the perfective.
   Common trans-aspectual verbs are:

       -ntamâ’/—         ‘bite’

       omfle-/—          ‘miss, come close’
       -tamaa/—          ‘step on’
       tetena/—          ‘come together’
       tlâa’/—           ‘be sad’

       -Øˆ(-)            ‘transfer’On the zero root with the meaning ‘transfer’ (which is given last in the
preceding list), see 8.5.5.1.
   In terms of their semantics, many of these verbs describe punctual events,
which are incompatible with imperfective aspect. Compare, for example:(33)   maâ’-Ø-i-o=be
       stand_up.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ-EP=DECL
       ‘I stood up.’(34)   maâ’-bl-Ø-i=be
       stand_up.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I’m standing.’ (lit. ‘I stood up and am staying’)
                                  8.3. Perfective and imperfective verb stems   257In other cases, such as -silêb ‘follow (PFV)’ it is less clear why an imperfective
stem should be lacking on semantic grounds. Thus, some gaps in the aspectual
stem system seems to be accidental.
   Perfective-only stems can generally be serialized with an auxiliary to
express unbounded events, e.g.:(35)   n       geim=o
       1SG      pronged_arrow=PL.N1       tebe-toulêb-bl-Ø-i=be
       PL.LONG.O-gather_in_arms.PFV-AUX.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I’m holding pronged arrows in my arms.’ (lit. ‘I have gathered
       pronged arrows in my arms and stay.’A more detailed discussion of auxiliary serialization with perfective stems is
found in section 8.6.7.3.
   Imperfective-only verbs lack a perfective stem, for instance be ‘be walking,
keep V-ing’ is always imperfective:(36)   ináb=e         y      be-b-e=be
       snake=SG.M     there   walk.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
       ‘A snake is moving along there.’ [Observed]This is an exhaustive list of imperfective-only verbs.(37)   —/afen             ‘be alive’
       —/be               ‘be walking, keep V-ing’
       —/ei               ‘fly (of birds and bats)’
       —/hâa’             ‘roam’
       —/-hâa’            ‘chase’
       —/ikam holol       ‘tiptoe’
       —/mangglom         ‘cry (plural subject)’
       —/mokob            ‘like, love’
       —/sasan            ‘moan’
       —/un               ‘hum, drone’
       —/wâala            ‘fly (of insects and helicopters)In most of these cases it is not obvious why – given the meaning of the verb –
it should lack a perfective stem. I take these gaps to be accidental. It is of
course possible to say that for instance a flying action took place in the past.
For that a serialization with an imperfective auxiliary must be used, as in (38):

"
8.6.7.2. Habitual formsVerbs inflected with -b ‘Imperfective’ can have a (present) habitual
interpretation apart from the more basic continuous meaning (see 8.6.1.4).
However, there is also a dedicated habitual construction involving the
auxiliary habitual stem of the existential verb bina. As one would expect, the
habitual auxiliary cannot be collocated with perfective stems. Habitual verb
forms are always further suffixed by -b ‘Imperfective’.(180) ae,       n      amítye

‘habitually’ and amít(ye) ‘always’.
   The past habitual is formed by serializing biaana with an imperfective
stem. Again, there is obligatory further suffixation of the imperfective aspect
suffix -b:(181) naka=i

       ‘They used to use poison magic on people (but not anymore).’
       [Dafinau]
8.6.7.3. Auxiliary-serialization with perfective stemsSome perfective stems can be serialized with an imperfective auxiliary in
order to express that the result of the action denoted by the perfective stem is
continuing after the execution of the action. Consider the perfective-only verb
stem -fû’/— ‘grab’. In (182), the result of a punctual action is described. In
(183), the focus is on the continuation of the result of the action of grabbing,
i.e. holding:(182) a-fû’-n-e=be
      3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘He has grabbed it.’(183) a-fû-bi-n-e=be
      3SG.N1.O-grab.PFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘He has been holding it.’ (lit. ‘He has grabbed it and has been
      staying up to now’)The core class of perfective stems which can be serialized with a stem of the
existential verb in the function of an auxiliary are those which show this
aspect alternation. Perfective stems which belong to the core class almost all
lack an imperfective stem:

serialization extends to other perfective stems, for which the aspect alternation
is less obvious because they refer to activities, which are extended in time,
rather than to punctual events. Some of these have distinct imperfective stems,
for example:

      1SG     eat.PFV-AUX.IPFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ-HPST=DECL
      ‘Yesterday, having eaten I was staying.’As there is an obvious aspect mismatch in forms like dowôn’binisobe in (186),
which consists of a perfective stem dowôn’ ‘eat’ and an imperfective auxiliary
bi, the two events cannot be interpreted as overlapping but rather as a bounded
event plus the continuation of the result of this event, thus dowôn’binisobe
‘yesterday, having eaten I stayed’.
    In order to express that the result of a bounded event is continuing at the
present moment, a perfective stem must be serialized with the imperfective
auxiliary stem bi which is then suffixed by -Ø ‘Imperfective’, as in (187):(187) két=e

        ‘He’s holding the container’ (lit. ‘Having grabbed the container,
        he’s staying’)Imperfective stems generally do not have this possibility, but see 8.4 for
obligatorily auxiliary-serialized verbs in the imperfective (X-stems), where an
imperfective stem is followed by a form of the existential verb.","[331, 332, 333, 334]"

9.10.7.    Position of temporal nounsTemporal expressions are for example sinanggwâno ‘in days of yore’ or
memâlo ‘now, today’ (see 3.1.9). In contrast to adverbs and postpositional
adjuncts, which generally precede the verb, temporal expressions occur
clause-initially, as in (114), or after the first overt argument noun phrase,
which is the subject in unmarked constituent order, as in (115). The pre-verbal

a temporal clause (116) and a conditional clause (117). Adverbial clauses are
given in brackets:(116) [naka=i                utl-Ø-ib=o]

(see 9.10.5).
Chapter 8
Verb morphology
8.0.      IntroductionThe Mian verb is by far the most morphologically complex category in the
language. Many verbs formally distinguish a perfective and an imperfective
stem, which are used to express bounded and unbounded events, respectively.
Aspectual stem distinctions are a typical feature of the Mountain Ok
languages (Healey 1964a: 68). They can also be found in other Papuan
languages, e.g. Korafe (Farr 1999: 22-23) and Abui (Kratochvíl 2007: 82-86).
    Mian is mildly polysynthetic in that all finite verbs obligatorily index their
subject and the recipient object, if a recipient is part of the verb’s argument
structure. A subset of verbs also marks their objects. All argument affixes are
pronominal in nature, i.e. they are not pure agreement affixes. They cross-
reference overt argument noun phrases, which can be freely elided. Argument
affixes agree with overt argument noun phrases in person, number and gender.
If the argument noun phrase is elided, argument affixes agree anaphorically.
    The verb has two slots for tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, one on either
side of the subject suffix slot. The pre-subject slot accommodates a range of
tense, aspect, and mood suffixes, whereas the post-subject slot is filled only by
tense suffixes. The fillers of the post-subject slot are probably more recent
grammaticalizations from erstwhile auxiliary constructions, in which an
inflected auxiliary has been reanalysed as a tense suffix.
    Verbs are inflected directly for certain TAM combinations. Direct
inflection here means that the TAM suffix is appended directly to the verb
stem. A serialization of a lexical verb stem with a form of the existential verb
is required for other TAM combinations. In this case the TAM suffix is
appended to the existential verb.
    It is typical for verbs in many Papuan languages to be marked for
illocutionary force (Foley 1986: 164). Mian has several sentential clitic
particles which attach to the verb to signal the illocutionary force of an
utterance as declarative or quotative, as a question, or as hortative.
    Mian verbs productively form serial verb constructions. Verb serialization
is discussed in section 11.1 under chaining.
244    8. Verb morphology8.1.     Classification of verbsVerbs can be classified according to three criteria, namely position in the
sentence, possibility of direct inflection, and finiteness. A further division in
four conjugation classes will be made in 8.4.
    First, finite verbs can either be directly inflected for various TAM
categories or serialized with an auxiliary. See 8.6.1 on directly inflected verbs
and 8.6.7 on auxiliary-serialized verbs.
    Second, finite verbs are either final or medial. Mian is a clause-chaining
language. Simple sentences contain one final verb, whereas complex
sentences usually consist of clauses chained together, each of which contains a
medial verb while the last clause in a given chain, which forms the end of the
sentence, terminates with a final verb. All final verbs index their subjects and
any of the object(s) that this verb has to index, and can be inflected for all
TAM categories, while medial verbs are slightly more restricted in terms of
their TAM morphology. Medial verbs cannot be inflected for irrealis or
deontic mood. Furthermore, they are never marked for polarity or
illocutionary force. Tense marking with -bio ‘General past’ and -so ‘Hesternal
past’ on medial verbs is possible. Medial verbs partake in the switch-reference
system of the language. They are inflected for same or different subject, i.e.
they have suffixes which mark whether or not the subject of the following
clause is the same. The same suffixes also indicate sequentiality or
simultaneity of events.
    Third, verbs are either finite or non-finite. Any verb (or serial verb
construction) marked for subject is finite, any verb not marked for subject is
non-finite.
    As medial verbs and their morphology are intricately linked to the
phenomenon of clause-chaining, their morphology is described in section 10.2
under clause-chaining constructions.","[267, 268, 269, 270]"
"
11.1.    Serial verb constructionsMian serial verb constructions (SVCs) consist of several concatenated verb
stems. There are no markers of coordination, subordination, or of any
syntactic dependency. In a SVC, all verbs except the last one in the sequence
are verb stems, i.e. they are not marked for subject nor do they carry
information about tense or polarity. They can, however, index their own
objects in the form of affixes.
   Mian mostly has same-subject serializations (Crowley 1987: 38), i.e. all
verbs in a SVC share the same subject, which is cross-referenced on the last
verb in the sequence. The only notable exception are causative serializations,
which are of the type ‘I drop the arrow, it falls’. In these the subjects have to
be distinct.
406       11. Chaining constructions    The last verb in a SVC is a fully inflected verb according to the
morphological patterns of either medial or final verbs depending on whether
the SVC is the predicate of a medial or a non-medial clause (i.e. a final clause
in a clause chain or an independent sentence). Any information on
illocutionary force, polarity, or tense invariably has scope over the whole
SVC.
    An important structural distinction that is made for SVCs is at which
‘layer’ of the clause they occur. Foley and Olsen (1985) argue that verb
serialization can occur at either the nucleus or the core of the clause. The
different clause layers are distinguished by sets of operators pertaining to a
particular layer. For example, aspect operates at nucleus level and nominal
arguments at core level.
    Core SVCs in Mian allow verbs to have their own objects, whereas aspect
need not be shared. A nuclear SVC, on the other hand, has just a single object,
if it is transitive. Furthermore, the aspect value of the component verbs must
not be at variance. While it is possible for either stem to be trans-aspectual, it
is impossible that one is perfective and the other imperfective. This is not a
problem in core SVCs.","[431, 432]"
"S and A are always indexed on finite verbs. Mian has one syntactic relation of
object, which is indicated morphologically in different ways. The O of
transitive verbs can be indexed with (i) a classificatory prefix, (ii) a
pronominal object prefix, (iii) a pronominal object suffix, or (iv) not at all.
The choice between these four marking patterns depends on the indexing
properties of individual verbs. The four marking patterns define four subtypes
of transitive verb, which I describe in detail below. Ditransitives appear in a
double object construction, one of which being O (i.e. the gift) the other R
(recipient). O is indexed with a prefix or not at all, R is indexed with a suffix.
   On the issue of grammatical relations and morphological marking patterns
on the verb, see 3.14.
   Mian is strongly zero-anaphoric. Noun phrase arguments tend to be
dropped if referent identity can easily be retrieved. Noun phrases are also
commonly elided if referent identity is obvious from the context or from
speaker knowledge, e.g. the verb kè ‘cut (scraped taro) into slabs’ can occur
with the overt object noun phrase imen nini ‘scraped taro’ but most often it
does not. Thus, clauses very often consist just of a verb whose argument
indexing or classificatory affixes allow tracking of discourse participants.",[358]
"
9.2.1.       Transitives with classificatory prefix (absolutive alignment)Subclass 1 of transitive verbs comprises those verbs with classificatory
prefixes, which classify the object according to semantic criteria (cf. chapter 5
for a thorough description of the classificatory prefixes), e.g.:(19)       n      memâlo     fút=e
           1SG     now        tobacco=SG.N1           tob-ò-n-i=a

           ‘Now I get the tobacco leaf, and then I ...’ [Rolling smokes]
                                                           9.2. Transitives   341Object noun phrase elision is possible without affecting the grammaticality of
the utterance. In isolation, such an utterance is semantically less specific:(20)     tob-ò-n-i=a
         3SG.LONG.O-get.PFV-SS.SEQ-1SG.SBJ=MED
         ‘I get the LONG OBJECT, and then I ...’Other transitive verbs with obligatory classificatory prefix are: -ma/-san
‘plant’, -êb/— ‘take, pick up (in order to carry)’, -ba ‘cover (of liquids)’,
-bià/— ‘throw’, -bù ‘bury’, -fâ/-ka ‘put’, -kimà/-kimsan ‘put in the fire’, -ò/—
‘get, take’, -ski ‘turn’, -tanà/-tunu ‘light’, -tlâa’/— ‘remove’, and -Øˆ/—
‘take’. For a comprehensive list, see 5.8.","[366, 367]"
"
9.3.     AmbitransitivesAmbitransitives can be used either transitively or intransitively without any
overt derivation. Dixon (2002: 177) distinguishes two types of ambitransitive
verb: the “S=A type” (e.g. English eat) and the “S=O type” (e.g. English
open).
    A small number of Mian verbs prima facie resemble S=O ambitransitives,
i.e. verbs where intransitive S becomes transitive O, as in the English example
‘the door opened’ vs. ‘I opened the door’. Consider the examples (37) and
(38):(37)   as=e              haka-b-i=be
       tree=N1.SG        break.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
       ‘I am splitting a tree (to produce firewood).’(38)   as=e             haka-b-e=ne?
       tree=SG.N1       break.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=Q
       ‘Is a tree breaking (down)?’ [Flood]This alternation looks like what one typically finds in S=O ambitransitives.
The O argument of the transitive clause becomes the S argument of the
intransitive clause. In both uses the semantic role of S/O, namely the patient,
stays the same, but the syntactic relations change. S/O has the function of
object in a transitive clause while it has the function of subject in an
intransitive clause.
                                                        9.3. Ambitransitives   347    Furthermore, the transitive manifestation of the S=O ambitransitive verb
includes a causative component (expressed through the agent) which the
intransitive manifestation lacks. Compare:(39)   éim=e                        belâ-Ø-i-o=be
       pandanus_fruit=SG.N1         break.PFV-REAL-1SG.SBJ-EP=DECL
       ‘I have cut across the pandanus fruit.’(40)   tóm=e              belâ-s-e=ta
       stone=SG.N1        break.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.N1.SBJ=MED
       ‘the stone (gate) opened and then someone else…’ [Danenok]However, the intransitive reading in (40), and (38) above, is not the only one
available. Each utterance can also be interpreted transitively. This is because
the subject suffixes for neuter 1 singular and masculine singular subjects are
homophonous. The following analysis is also possible:(41)   as=e            haka-b-e=ne?
       tree=SG.N1      break.IPFV-IPFV-3SG.M.SBJ=Q
       ‘Is he chopping a tree?’(42)   tóm=e             belâ-s-e=ta
       stone=SG.N1       break.PFV-DS.SEQ-3SG.M.SBJ=MED
       ‘he breaks open the stone (gate) and then someone else…’ [Danenok]In S=A ambitransitives, such as English eat, the object can be elided freely,
without affecting the semantic roles within the clause. However, leaving out
the object of S=O ambitransitives leads necessarily to an intransitive
interpretation of the clause. If the object of break in ‘I broke the vase’ is
omitted, the subject changes semantic roles and the understanding would be
that the speaker is undergoing the breaking (e.g. because of pressure, distress,
etc.).
    Mian ambitransitives do not follow this expected pattern. Rather, when an
overt object is lacking, the subject can be interpreted as either the agent or the
patient. Compare (43) and (44):(43)   dòu-n-o=be
       close-REAL-3SG.F.SBJ=DECL
       ‘She closes (e.g. the door).’

9.4.     Derived transitivesTransitives can be derived from intransitives. This can be productive
derivation with -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’, which introduces another participant into
the argument structure of the verb or idiosyncratic derivation, where for two
verbs the transitive variant has a prefix indexing the object while the
intransitive variant does not have a prefix.
                                                    9.4. Derived transitives   3499.4.1.    Productive derivation of transitivesThe verb -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ plays an important role in increasing the valency
of a verb by one. It is productively used in a compound with another verb stem
as a valency-increasing device with an applicative-like function. The use of
‘give’ as a valency-increasing device is attested in a number of TNG
languages, for example Kewa (Franklin 1971), Menya (Whitehead 2004), and
Tairora (Vincent 1973).
   In Mian, most intransitive verbs can be compounded with -ûb’- ‘give
(PFV)’ in order to introduce another participant into the argument structure of
the verb through the object suffix (recipient) on the ‘give’-verb. This type of
‘give’-compounding is used in the perfective only. The spectrum of semantic
roles that can be mapped onto this additional argument is quite wide and
includes benefactives/malefactives, possessors, and experiencers, depending
on the semantics of the verb compounded with ‘give’ (see 8.5.5.4).
   The use of -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ in compounded with the intransitive motion
verb un~on ‘go (PFV)’ is illustrated in example (46):(46)     fanà=ta          un-ût’-ne-n-e=ne?
         do_what=MED      go.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=CQ
         ‘How has he escaped me?’ (lit. ‘What has he done, has he gone on
         me?’) [Klebein]Compounding with ‘give’ is used to introduce an experiencer role into the
argument structure of verbs of perception or verbs denoting physiological or
psychological processes. The following examples show this for kun- ‘emanate
smell on somebody’ and dub- ‘affect somebody, taste (in a certain way) to
somebody’:(47)     Danenok      dab-wal=i

         taste.PFV-give.PFV-1SG.R-REAL-3SG.N1.SBJ=DECL
         ‘The tobacco tastes bitter to me.’In the imperfective, the object suffix is simply appended to the verb without
-ûb- ‘give’, e.g.:(49)     yle     kenéng
         well     cheek         sikà’-ye-biaan-o=a
         swell.IPFV-PL.AN.R-AUX.IPFV.SS.SIM-3PL.N1.SBJ=MED
         ‘well, their cheeks were swelling up’ [Sofelok 2]Derivation of transitives from intransitives in the imperfective is as productive
as compounding with -ûb’- ‘give (PFV)’ in the perfective.
   Other examples of derived transitives are:(50)     tl-          ‘come to somebody (PFV), only in the figurative sense
                      of ‘happen to somebody’, from tl~te ‘come (PFV)’
         un-          ‘go for sb, escape from somebody (PFV)’, from un ‘go
                      (PFV)’
         klaa-        ‘rot on somebody (e.g. a body part)’, from klaa ‘rot’
         okok ke-     ‘work for somebody, from okok ke ‘work’ (lit. ‘work
                      do’)
         kaan-        ‘die for somebody (PFV)’, from kaan ‘die (PFV)’ (This
                      is probably a Christian concept.)
         kou-         ‘have sex with somebody, from kou ‘have sex’
         kun-         ‘smell (lit. ‘emanate smell on sb’)’, from kun ‘emanate
                      smell’
         dub-         ‘feel to somebody, taste to somebody, from dobô ‘feel,
                      taste’
         tou-         ‘ambush (i.e. ‘sit down for somebody, from tou ‘sit
                      down’
         bi-          ‘exist for somebody, own’, from the existential verb
                      bi~bl ‘exist, stay, remain (IPFV)’
9.4.2.     Idiosyncratic derivationFor two verbs valency alternates between monovalent and bivalent depending
on the presence of a pronominal object prefix or a classificatory prefix. One of
                                                            9.5. Ditransitives   351these is ‘see’, which has intransitive têm’/temê’ ‘have a look’ and transitive
-têm’/-temê’ ‘see, look at’. This is illustrated by transitive (51) and intransitive
(52):(51)    memâ      yomintén=i          wa-têm’-n-ib=a

        ‘he was guarding the pig looking (around) and...’ [Danenok]For the verb san ‘grow (IPFV, intransitive)’ vs. -san ‘plant (IPFV, transitive)
valency is determined by the absence or presence of a classificatory prefix.

 Masculine                        =e                imen ‘taro’
 Feminine                        =o                 imen ‘taro’, am ‘house’The analysis suggested by Foley is of course based on the description of Mian
gender found in Smith and Weston (1974b). As far as the formative /o/ is
concerned, Smith and Weston only use the term ‘feminine’ for animate nouns.
They go on to say that inanimates “are classified according to size or quantity”
(Smith and Weston 1974b: 41-42), i.e. plural inanimates (or quantities) and
nouns whose referents are considered to be of large size also take /o/, e.g.
kaawa-o ‘steel axe’, imen-o ‘large taro, quantity of taro’3 (Smith and Weston
1974b: 42).
    It is well-known that size can be an assignment criterion for gender (Foley
1986, Aikhenvald 2000). So it could indeed be the case that káawa ‘steel axe’
is assigned to the feminine gender because it is treated as referring to a large
object. The noun káawa would then be subject to the rule that inanimates in
Mian do not have a plural in /i/. However, contrary to Smith and Weston’s
claims I cannot confirm that this assignment strategy has any relevance for
large tokens of some types of objects that come in all shapes and sizes, like
taro tubers or string bags. My data suggests that one taro can only ever be
referred to with imen=e ‘a/the taro’ regardless of size. In order to express that
a certain taro tuber is big, a modifying adjective, e.g. sm ‘big’, has to be
used, thus imen=e sm=e ‘a/the big taro’. On the other hand, imen=o can only
mean ‘(the) taros’. Therefore, size does not seem to be a predominant
assignment criterion for inanimates in contemporary Mian.
    According to Smith and Weston, the other assignment criterion for
inanimates apart from size is quantity. The gender contrast is between =e for
singular or small quantity/number and =o for plural or large quantity/number.
Although the assignment criterion “quantity” is widespread in systems of
mensural and sortal classifiers and is also attested for classificatory verbs
(Aikhenvald 2000: 293, 300), it does not figure predominantly in gender
systems. Yet, in Mian we have seen that for homogeneous substances, like
                                   4.6. Alternative analysis of the gender system   181liquids, differences in the agreement pattern correlate with differences in
quantity, e.g. aai=e ‘some water’ vs. aai=o ‘much water’.
    A similar example comes from the Papuan language Manambu, where
mass nouns are assigned to their gender (masculine or feminine) on the basis
of quantity (Aikhenvald 1998). Hence, it seems plausible to assume that in
Mian homogeneous substances are assigned to their gender on the basis of
quantity as well. However, for most inanimates, namely those which refer to
discrete objects, the contrast is clearly not between small and large quantities
(as Smith and Weston claim), but rather a contrast between one object and
more than one objects, in other words, a contrast in number. Thus, an
inanimate noun with =e can only refer to a single entity, e.g. imen=e ‘a/the
taro’ / *‘a small amount of taro’.4
    A two-gender analysis for Mian entails that the feminine gender contains –
apart from female animates – also plural inanimates, such as imen=o ‘(the)
taros’, large quantities of substances, such as aai=o ‘much water’, and
inanimates for which there is no singular-plural distinction, such as am=o
‘(the) house(s)’ and káawa=o ‘(the) steel axe(s)’.","[206, 207]"

2.8.4.3. Stem accented verbsThese invariably have the accent on the last syllable of the verb stem. The
location of the accent is specified in the lexical entry for the stem accented
verb stem.
   In stem accented verbs, the inflection point for the tonal melody, which
spreads over the whole domain of the phonological verbal word, is the TBU in
the final stem syllable, e.g.:(115) /LHLhala/      ‘break (PFV verb stem)’
      /LHL-fa/       ‘put (PFV verb stem)’

remaining tones are associated and spread to right to include the final syllable.

are not animate plural) and /omab/ (for animate plural subject) are inherently
equipped with an accent which serves as the anchor point for tonal melodies in
off-stem accented verbs. This means that in irrealis forms of an off-stem
accented verb, the default accent on the syllable immediately after the stem is
overridden by the accent inherent in the suffix. Consider the following
derivation:

                                       3.11. Conjunctions and subordinators   1493.11.      Conjunctions and subordinatorsThe inventory of conjunctions and subordinators is rather small. Being a
clause-chaining language with morphologically rich medial verbs, Mian
mainly relies on the marking of sequentiality or simultaneity in medial verbs
to indicate temporal semantic relations between clauses for which English
uses conjunctions like then, after, when, as, while, etc. Adverbial clauses
without overt subordinators can have a range of semantic relations (namely
temporal, locative, or conditional) to their matrix clause. On adverbial clauses,
see 13.2. On the use of the postpositions temwât ‘while’ and dim ‘at the time
when’, as conjunctions in embedded adverbial clauses, see 13.2.6.
   The word class of conjunctions and subordinators comprises:(168) eka                ‘and’
      =a                 ‘and’ (< eka)
      bleka              ‘or’
      otâne              ‘but’
      kesoa              ‘because, since’
      bita               ‘until’
      mole               ‘if’Mian is a typical verb-final language since subordinators (kesoa ‘because’,
bita ‘until’, mole ‘if’) occur in clause-final position (Dryer 2007: 100). Co-
ordinating conjunctions (eka and =a ‘and’, bleka ‘or’, otâne ‘but’) are
prosodically a part of the first conjunct.
3.11.1.    eka ‘and’The conjunction eka ‘and’ is strictly coordinating, i.e. it can only be used if
two expressions are of the same syntactic order, e.g. both are noun phrases
(169), adjectival modifiers (170), or clauses (171):(169) Memin        i=e           eka Daning i=e                eka
          PN       father=SG.M    and PN          father=SG.M and
          ‘both Memin’s father and Daning’s father’ (Smith and Weston
          1974b: 99)(170) sob=e             ngáamein eka          beitlok=o=be
      soap=SG.N1        yellow       and      soft=PRD=DECL
      ‘The soap is yellow and soft.’
150       3. Word classes and grammatical relations(171) bi-n-o=a                               eka   imín

          come.PFV-SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED
          ‘she stayed and then came back and then ...’ [Afoksitgabáam]In (171), eka is redundant and binoa imin tenoa is also possible. I assume that
the medial verb clitic =a is derived from the coordinating clitic =a ‘and’,
which in turn is a shortened form of eka ‘and’. The coordinating clitic =a
‘and’ is used to coordinate noun phrases (see 6.7 for examples).
3.11.2.     bleka ‘or’The conjunction bleka ‘or’ is used to coordinate maximally two noun phrases,
as in (172), or clauses (173). In the latter case, the verb of the first clause
appears without an illocutionary clitic:(172) kbo           éil    -ta               bleka   aning    -ta
      2SG.M          pig    SG.N1-EMPH         or      fish     SG.N1-EMPH          dowôn’-aamab-eb=a?
          eat.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=Q
          ‘Do you want to eat pork or fish?’(173) kbo            memâlo       bib       bi-aamab-eb
      2SG.M           today        village   stay.IPFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ           bleka    damìb      un-aamab-eb=a?
           or       garden     go.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=Q
          ‘Are you going to stay in the village or go to the garden today?’Coordination of three or more alternatives is unattested. On bleka ‘or’ in polar
questions, see section 10.1.2.
3.11.3.     otâne ‘but’The conjunction otâne ‘but’ coordinates two clauses. The verb in the first
clause has final verb morphology, i.e. it can be inflected for irrealis and
deontic mood but appears without an illocutionary marker (174):
                                          3.11. Conjunctions and subordinators   151(174) sinta             imen=o         fu-n-amab-i

          (Smith and Weston 1974b: 131)
3.11.4.     kesoa ‘because, since’The causal conjunction kesoa ‘because, since’ invariably occurs after the verb
and intonationally belongs to this clause, which gives the reason. The
consequence is given in the succeeding clause, which forms its own
intonational unit:(175) [milimsîn=e                 háang-an-Ø-e                      kesoa] IU
      other_side=SG.N1            dry-VBLZ-REAL-3SG.N1.SBJ          because          [tob-ski-n-amab-i=be] IU
          3SG.LONG.O-turn-AUX.PFV-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-1SG.SBJ=DECL
          ‘Because the other side has dried, I’ll turn it (the tobacco leaf)
          around.’ [Rolling smokes]The conjunction kesoa is probably derived from a verb that constituted its own
medial clause in a clause chain. Verbal morphology including S/R marking
with -s ‘DS.SEQ’, and medial verb marking with the clitic =a is still clearly
discernible. The most likely candidate for the verb stem is the function verb ke
‘do’, thus ke-s-o=a [do-DS.SEQ-EXPL=MED]. Intonationally, however, kesoa
does not constitute its own clause anymore and the verb preceding kesoa
allows final verb morphology, i.e. inflection for polarity, mood, and
inchoative aspect (176) are permitted:(176) me-m-e                      kesoa
      cry.IPFV-INCH-3SG.M.SBJ     because
      ‘because he was crying’ [Crows]On the other hand, kesoa retains some features of an erstwhile medial clause.
Apart from the medial verb marker =a, =ta is also possible (kesota). As the
152       3. Word classes and grammatical relationsexact semantic difference between these two variants is unclear at this stage I
gloss them both as ‘because’.
3.11.5.     bita ‘until’The temporal conjunction bita ‘until’ expresses that the event described in the
preceding clause continues up to the onset of the event in the succeeding
clause:(177) deib=o            on        bl-Ø-ib                         bita
      road=N2           go.PFV    stay.IPFV-IPFV-2/3PL.AN.SBJ     until          bita       wàt-n-ib=ta
          until      across-SS.SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
          ‘they went and stayed (where they had gone to) until they went
          across (i.e. to Telefomin), and then they …’ [Mianmin and
          Telefomin]The conjunction bita ‘until’ very likely goes back to a shortened medial verb
form consisting of the existential verb bi and the medial clitic =ta. On such
shortened medial verb forms, see 11.2.13.
3.11.6.     mole ‘if’The conjunction mole ‘if’ is used in conditionals. An example is provided in
(178). For details on conditionals, see section 13.2.1.(178) y                      went-Ø-ib                         mole

                                                         3.12. Ideophones   1533.12.     IdeophonesIdeophones are sound-symbolic words that evoke certain perceptions and
sensations in a direct and vivid way (Dingemanse 2009). Ideophones are very
often phonologically peculiar. In Mian, they are phonologically marked in that
they often involve full reduplication, e.g. bangbang ‘clap’, bokbok ‘bubble’ or
partial reduplication, e.g. blele ‘fly’, fluluk ‘flutter (of a small bird)’.
Reduplication with ablaut is also attested, e.g. dingdung ‘hollow,
reverberating sound’, nikitneket ‘creak’, and fliliflala ‘blaze’. None of these
phonological characteristics are typical of any other word class. Semantically,
most ideophones refer to types of sound or types of movement. The corpus
contains roughly 60 ideophones (not counting linguistic renderings of animal
cries).
    Ideophones always immediately precede the main verb. They are further
subdivided into four classes depending on which type of verb they precede:   (i)      function verb ge/ga ‘say’
   (ii)     function verb ge/ga ‘say’ or existential verb n/bi~bl
   (ii)     motion verb, e.g. un~on/unê ‘go’, tl-~te/tle ‘come’
   (iv)     function verb ge/ga ‘say’ or motion verbIdeophones that refer to types of motion are adverb-like because they express
the manner of movement. In contrast to adverbs proper, ideophones are
syntactically fixed in front of the verb associated with them. Compare:(179) Milsen=e      blublu      un-Ø-e=be
      PN=M.SG       run         go.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=DECL
      ‘Milsen ran.’(180) *blublu Milsene unebeMany adverbs, on the other hand, are more mobile within the clause. Although
they tend to immediately precede the verb, as in (181), other positions are
possible, barring the position after the verb, as shown in (182):(181) n      imen=e           hebmamsâb       wen-b-i=be
      1SG     taro=SG.N1       quickly         eat.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
      ‘I’m eating a taro quickly.’(182) (hebmamsâb) n (hebmamsâb) imen=e (hebmamsâb) wen-b-i=be
      (*hebmamsâb) ‘I’m eating a taro quickly.’
154       3. Word classes and grammatical relationsIdeophones form fixed expressions with their associated verbs and do not
occur on their own, with the exception of bird cries. Thus, bangbang just
represents a clapping sound. Verbal nouns have to be used to refer to instances
of clapping or the activity of clapping:(183) bangbang       ge-nam-in
      clap           say.PFV-PFV-VN
      ‘(an instance of) clapping’(184) bangbang        ga-l-in

      ‘(activity of) clapping’
3.12.1.     With function verb ge/ga ‘say’The use of ideophones with the function verb ge/ga ‘say’ is illustrated in
examples (185) and (186):(185) fong             ge-s-ib=a

    Ideophones preceding the function verb have the same distribution as full
quotative sentential complements (see 12.1), here abbreviated as SC. Consider

6.6.     Dyadic termsDyadic terms are a subclass of the word class of nouns. They refer to a social
or a kin relationship between two or more people and encode relational
opposites (Evans 2003a, 2006). They can function as heads of noun phrases
which in turn are arguments of the predicate in the same clause. An example is

       ‘after the brothers had left it (as it was), one of them…’ [Danenok]Most frequently, dyads occur with a plural possessive pronoun which refers to
the whole set of individuals described by the dyad. The possessive pronoun
has appositive meaning:(70)   b           mikim
       2PL.POSS     opposite_sex_siblings(dyad)
       ‘you, brother and sister’The reason why I analyse the dyad as the noun phrase head with a possessive
pronoun in the possessor slot and not as a noun phrase apposed to a free
pronoun (an analysis suggested by the English translation I have chosen for
example (70) is because the pronoun forms are clearly from the possessive
pronoun series:(71)   *bo     mikimIn (71) the free personal pronoun cannot be used, cf. also nb mikim ‘we
(INCL), brother and sister’ and unacceptable *nbo mikim. I assume that the
possessive analysis is extended to the cases where the possessive pronoun is
homophonous with the free pronoun:(72)                   mikim
       3PL.AN.POSS      opposite_sex_siblings(dyad)
       ‘they, brother and sister’ [MPI Reciprocals clip 1]Dyads can be preceded by a proper name or kin noun, which is in an
appositional relation with the dyad, forming an inclusory construction.
Reference is to the dyad of individuals, only one of which is explicitly named.

6.7.        Noun phrase coordinationMian has four strategies for the coordination of noun phrases:-      juxtaposition
-      coordination with =sa ‘too’
-      coordination by =a ‘and’
-      coordination by eka ‘and’All of these strategies are available for animate and inanimate nouns alike.
Coordination by juxtaposition shows a maximum of two coordinated noun
phrases in the corpus whereas there is no upper limit of coordinated noun
phrase for the other two strategies.
    The simplest strategy of noun phrase coordination is juxtaposition.
Coordination by juxtaposition is mainly used if the referents of the coordinate
noun phrases are relatively low in individuation. Examples (77) and (78)
illustrate this for animates and inanimates, respectively:(77)      naka homòn     unáng     homòn=i
          man many       woman     many=AN.PL
          ‘many men and many women’ [Sofelok, 2]
226    6. The noun phrase(78)   db=o          ket=o
       seed=N1.PL blossom=N1.PL
       ‘seeds and blossoms’ [Sofelok, 1]Coordination by juxtaposition is not available with noun phrases referring to
individuals or singular entities in subject or object position. However,
juxtaposition of proper names occurs in the possessor position:(79)   Fitibkanib=o Dimoson                        wengsâng=o
       PN=SG.F           PN          3PL.AN.POSS story=N2
       ‘the story of Fitibkanib and Dimosson’ [Fitibkanib and Dimosson]Givón (1990: 497) notes that noun phrases which are conjoined by simple
juxtaposition often yield unified group lexical items. Wälchli (2005) calls
compounds whose component parts refer to stereotypically conjoined entities
additive co-compounds. Mian has a few such lexical items, e.g. alél-melel (lit.
wife-offspring) ‘(core) family’ and awók-aalok ‘adults, parents’, consisting of
awók ‘mother’ and a cranberry morph -aalok without any synchronically
establishable meaning. Although these were probably formed by juxtaposition
and at least partially have become semantically opaque, noun phrase
juxtaposition synchronically is a syntactic device forming coordinate noun
phrases without any tendency for lexicalization.
   The second coordination strategy involves the clitic noun phrase modifier
=sa ‘too’, which attaches to each coordinate noun phrase. Coordinate noun
phrases can refer to individuals (80) or to groups (81). The coordinated noun
phrases are bracketed:(80)   [Kasening     ]=sa         [Albet    ]=sa          y
       PN            3SG.M=too     PN        3SG.M=too      there       tl-Ø-io=be

       adults’ [Building a Spirit House]
                                            6.7. Noun phrase coordination   227The third coordination strategy uses the clitic =a ‘and’ (presumably a
shortened form of eka ‘and’), which cliticizes to each noun phrase in the
coordinate structure, as in (82) and (83) or just appears once on the rightmost
member of the coordination, as in (84). Note that the order of the article and
the coordinator on the last coordinated member is reversed. Reversal does not
take place if the last noun in the coordination ends in /a/, as in (83):(82)   naka=ya unáng=a=i
       man=and woman=and=PL.AN
       ‘(the) men and women’ [Dimosson](83)   tn=a        unáng=a      naka=i=a
       child=and woman=and man=PL.AN=and
       ‘children, women, and men’ [Leaf oven](84)   nakamín-wal=i        imak-wal=a=i
       brother-PL=PL.AN     husband-PL=and=PL.AN
       ‘brothers and husbands’ [Mianmin and Telefomin]An example of an inanimate noun phrase coordinated with =a ‘and’ is
provided in (85):(85)   n=a         kakab=a       bobol=a=o
       liver=and lungs=and heart=and=PL.N1
       ‘liver, lungs, and heart’ [Crows]Instead of =a ‘and’ one also finds eka ‘and’ in noun phrase coordination. The
coordinated noun phrases appear in square brackets:(86)   [Memin    i=e]       eka [Daning       i=e]       eka
       PN        father=SG.M and PN            father=SG.M and
       ‘Memin’s father and Daning’s father’ (from Smith and Weston

       SG.M=too
       ‘he himself and Bokolfet’s younger brother too’ [Mianmin and
       Telefomin]
228    6. The noun phraseThe conjunction eka ‘and’ is also used for the coordination of adjectival
modifiers within a single noun phrase. The first adjective in such a
coordination must not have a distributed article, as in example (88):(88)   sob=e           sm(*=e)          eka   tekebmín   le
       soap=SG.N1 big(*=SG.N1)           and   long       DEM.PROX.SG.N1
       ‘this big and long (bar of) soap’
6.8.     Noun phrase appositionIn my analysis of noun phrase apposition in Mian I follow Rijkhoff (2002),
who defines appositional modifiers as “all those elements which semantically
speaking serve the same purpose as their non-apposed […] counterparts, but
which from a syntactic point of view are not part of the […] phrase containing
the head noun. An obvious requirement of any apposed modifier phrase is co-
reference: it must refer to the same entity as the other member(s) in the
appositional construction” (p. 22).
   Appositive noun phrases always follow the noun phrase to which they are
apposed. Typical examples include apposition of a proper name, as in (89) and
(90), specification of a profession (91), and a reflexive pronoun with
contrastive function (92). In the following examples, the appositional
modifiers are separated by a comma.(89)   n           imak=e,             Nialiaaleb=e
       1SG.POSS     husband=SG.M        PN=SG.M

       ‘we, ourselves, are making (these arrows) while we…’ [Arrows]Noun phrase apposition is commonly used to clearly identify the referent(s) of
a pronoun, for example a demonstrative:

       ‘these (ones), the older brothers and fathers’ [Mianmin and
       Telefomin]
6.9.     Noun phrase topicalizationTopic-marking in Mian is done with the topic clitic =le which attaches to
noun phrases, including free pronouns. I analyse =le as a clitic rather than an
affix because it not only attaches to pronouns but can mark topical adverbial
clauses and medial clauses in clause chains as well. Topical constituents with
=le are intonationally detached from the following clause.
    Topic marking with =le is incompatible with emphatic pronouns, which
are used for focus (see 6.10), e.g. *-ta=le [3SG.M-EMPH=TOP].
    Topic-only question are a type of interrogative in which only a topic is
mentioned. The speaker has a particular question in mind, and it must be
obvious from the context what the implied question is, such as I’m going. And
you? (Implied: Are you going as well?). Two examples are given below:(94)   kbo=le?
       2SG.M=TOP
       ‘What about you?’ (Possible implication: ‘What are you doing?’,
       ‘What do you want to eat?’)(95)   Mandat    =le?
       PN        3SG.M=TOP
       ‘What about Milsen?’ (Possible implication: ‘What’s Milsen doing?’
       ‘Where is Milsen?’)Topic marking is commonly found in personal introductions (|| marks an
intonational break in all examples in this section):(96)   n=le         ||  Dabein       n-ta=bo
       1SG=TOP           PN           1SG-EMPH=QUOT
       ‘ “As for me, Dabein that’s me.” ’ [Dimosson]Subjects can be topicalized with =le, as in the following excerpts from an
account of traditional initiation, where the topic is given:
230    6. The noun phrase(97)   [...] ‘Adults would line the side of the path. Others (also adults)
       would lead the boys who are to be initiated, and they (i.e. the boys)
       walked along the path ...’       tam                 =le             ||
       here_sideways        PL.AN=TOP       was=o             ol-ò-n-ib=a
       drums=N1.PL PL.RESID.O-take-SEQ-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=MED
       ‘as for the ones on the side (i.e. the adults), they take drums and ...’
       [Initiation rituals]This bit of discourse contains two groups of adults, as opposed to the boys,
one group lining the path, the other leading the boys. The topic pronoun is
here used to establish the first group of adults as the topic of the new clause.
    Topics are typically given information but this is not necessarily the case,
as in the following example where an object is topicalized which has not been
previously mentioned in the discourse:(98)   memé          =le               ||        Sobining=e
       children      PL.AN=TOP                    PN=SG.M       dl-êt-n-e=a

       ‘As for the children, Sobining took them and ...’ [Sobining]Multiple topicalized constituents can often be found as discourse openers (de
Vries 2005). In the following example, the first topic yomin=o=le is a more
general topic of the whole narrative, set up here as a discourse frame by the
speaker:(99)   yomin=o=le              ||   yangpela=i=le                    ||
       initiation=N2=TOP            young_ones(TP)=PL.AN=TOP       alukûm          dli     tat-n-ib=a

       ‘As for the initiation, the young ones, they went downriver and
       then ...’ [Initation rituals]
                                               6.10. Focused noun phrases   2316.10.    Focused noun phrases“[F]ocus is the most important or salient piece of information in the utterance,
as perceived by the speaker. [...] The focus [...] always presents new
information, though new relative to the topic, not necessarily new in the
discourse” (Siewierska 2004: 159).
   Focus in Mian is marked by using an emphatic pronoun, etc., i.e. a bound
pronominal form suffixed with the emphatic pronoun suffix -ta (see 3.7.4)
Marking of focus is characteristic of Papuan languages in general, contrary to
fixed positional encoding in European languages, where focus is associated
with clause-final position (Foley 2000: 387-8).
   Contrastive focus in Mian is generally expressed by using emphatic
pronouns. Two examples are given below:(100)           Asuneb=e=mo        a-têm’-Ø-e=ba=be
      3SG.M      PN=SG.M=NEG        3SG.M.O-see-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ=NEG=DECL                Beitab     -ta

        ‘the husband went to sit down at pig fruits (to ambush pigs), the wife

questions (see 10.1.3). When there is a choice between two alternatives, each
232    6. The noun phraseexpressed by a noun phrase, both are in contrastive focus and emphatic
pronouns have to be used, as in the following example:(102) kbo           éil    -ta             bleka        aning      -ta
      2SG.M          pig    SG.M-EMPH        or           fish       SG.M-EMPH       dowôn’-aamab-eb=a?
       eat-IRR.NANPL.SBJ-2SG.SBJ=Q
       ‘Do you want to eat pork or fish?’On completive focus in content questions with wan ‘who’, see 10.2.7.
  Focus marking is used in comparisons. I recorded example (103) as the
Mian translation of the English sentence “Port Moresby is bigger that
Vanimo” (|| indicates an intonational break):(103) Mosbi      =le             || sm    eka      Banimo       -ta
       PN        SG.N2=TOP           big    and      PN           SG.N2-EMPH       gwáab=o=be
       small=PRD=DECL
       ‘(As for) Port Moresby (, it) is big, and Vanimo is small.’This example consists of a topical noun phrase ‘Port Moresby’, set off
intonationally from the rest of the utterance, and a comment which actually
predicates something about this topic. The comparative element is focused
with -ta, but the statement, which prima facie seems to be about Vanimo, is in
effect a statement about the topic Port Moresby.
Chapter 7
The postpositional phrase
7.0.     IntroductionPostpositional phrases are adverbial adjuncts which fulfil a variety of
functions, such as situating an event spatially or temporally, or specifying an
instrument involved in an action. Postpositional phrases in Mian are always
syntactically optional. They provide additional adverbial information but their
omission never renders a clause syntactically incomplete.
   Postpositions can be simple or complex. An example of a simple
postposition is (1). Simple postpositions typically encliticize if their
complement is bare, as in (2):(1)    naka    -ta             baka

       ‘while she was curing (them, i.e. frogs) with a torch there,
       someone else ...’ [Crows]Complex postpositions either consist of two or three combined postpositions,
e.g. tabáab-tem-daak [beneath-in(to)-down] ‘down underneath’, as in (3), or
they are denominal derivations formed by suffixing -daa ‘at’ to a noun (see
3.1.5), as in (4):(3)    hàs=e              tabáab-tem-daak
       hat(TP)=SG.N1      beneath-in(to)-down

234    7. The postpositional phrase7.1.     Simple spatial postpositional phrases with a directionalThese consist of one noun phrase without a determiner and one directional
postposition. The inventory of directionals comprises:(5)    ut          ‘up(wards)’

       tm         ‘sideways, at the same level’
       wt         ‘across’For every postpositional phrase, there is an allative and a locative

       ‘down at the water drinking (place), a large tree broke down and then

or any other adnominal determiner nor can it be followed by adjectival
modifiers:(11)   *Skiobib=o=tab
       PN=N2=downriver
       Intended: ‘downriver at/to Skiobib’The postpositional phrase can optionally be followed by an article. In this case
the postposition does not cliticize. The article can agree in gender and number
with the noun in the preceding complement. The following two examples
show that the article following the postposition agrees in gender and number
with kakam ‘buttocks, butt’ (gender: N1) and tibín ‘river head’ (gender: N2),
respectively:(12)   kakam            tab=e             […]     ge-n-e=a

       ‘they ascended, up to the head of the river Sek’ [Flood]Gender agreement of the article is mostly disregarded and =o is used
regardless of the gender of the noun, thus instead of kakam tab=e ‘down at the
buttocks’ in (12) one also finds kakam tab=o. The article =o also marks
temporal nouns (see 3.1.9) and adverbial clauses (see 13.2) and is a default
marker for all adverbial adjuncts.
236    7. The postpositional phrase    The phrases kakam tabe and Sek tibín uto in (12) and (13) might look like
noun phrases as far as their internal syntax is concerned because they end in
an article. But in simple postpositional phrases with a directional only the
article is allowed. Noun phrases allow the full range of adnominally used
pronouns (see 6.2.3).","[249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262]"

11.2.1.   Introduction and terminologySwitch reference (S/R) is a discourse tracking device, whose main function is
to monitor the subject (S/R pivot), i.e. to indicate through verbal morphology
whether the subject of an adjacent clause is identical to or different from the
subject of the present clause.
    Some have termed S/R systems ‘exotic’ mainly because the combination of
formal and functional properties found in S/R systems suggests a violation of
the Principal of Categorial Iconicity (Haiman 1985), which postulates that a
distinction is normally marked on the category to which it applies
semantically. However, as pointed out by Stirling (1993: 137), S/R systems
commonly combine reference tracking with other functions, such as indicating
more generally a continuity or discontinuity between clauses (also see Comrie
(1983: 23)). Hence, S/R systems provide information about relations between
whole clauses, not just about the pivot noun phrases. If conceived of as a
multi-functional system of agreement with the clause as its semantic domain,
it does not come as a surprise that S/R distinctions are marked on the head of
the clause, namely the verb, especially since S/R languages tend to be head-
marking. Apart from this difference in the locus of marking, there is no
principled difference between S/R and other means of tracking the reference
of participants in discourse, such as anaphoric pronouns, gender systems, and
other systems of nominal classification. For a detailed discussion of these
issues, see Stirling (1993: 135-147).
    In Papuan languages, S/R marking usually occurs in clause chaining
constructions (Longacre 1972, Foley and Van Valin 1984, Foley 1986, Foley
2000, Roberts 1997). Any two adjacent clauses in such chains form a pair
consisting of a ‘marked’ clause and a ‘reference’ clause. In adopting this
terminology I follow Farr (1999: 177-178). The marked clause is marked for
co-/disjoint reference of the subject with respect to the reference clause. These
terms hark back to a study of S/R systems by Munro (1980).
422       11. Chaining constructions    In clause chaining constructions each marked clause (i.e. each clause in the
chain apart from the last) contains a medial verb which is marked for ‘same
subject’ (SS) or ‘different subject’ (DS) in relation to the subject of the
reference clause. This reference clause in turn is a marked clause with respect
to the next clause in the chain, that is, the verb of this clause is again marked
for same subject or switch reference in relation to the subject of its reference
clause. As the final clause contains the independent verb which is not marked
for switch reference, final clauses are only ever reference clauses and never
marked clauses. Similarly, the first clause in a clause chain is never a
reference clause but only ever a marked clause, even if this first clause is a so-
called ‘recapitulation clause’ in tail-head linkage (De Vries 2005). On tail-
head linkage in Mian, see section 11.4.","[447, 448]"
"
9.2.2.    Transitives with object prefix (accusative alignment)Subclass 2 of transitive verbs contains those with an obligatory object prefix
which signals person, number, and (in the third person) the gender of the
object. These verb stems are given in (21). The formal details of pronominal
object prefixes are covered in section 8.5.5.(21)     -e          ‘hit, kill (IPFV)’
         -fû’        ‘grab (PFV)’
         -lò         ‘hit, kill (PFV)’
         -nâ’        ‘hit, kill (PFV)’
         -ntamâ’     ‘bite (PFV)’
         -têm’       ‘see (PFV)’
         -temê’      ‘look at (IPFV)’This type of argument marking shows accusative alignment. The subjects of
intransitive verbs (S) and transitive verbs (A) are treated in the same way,
different from the object of transitive verbs (O). The accusative alignment
pattern is illustrated by comparing an intransitive verb (22) with a transitive
verb (23):(22)     yle    on-s-io=be
         well    go.PFV-RPST-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=DECL
         ‘Well, they went.’ [Pig story](23)     yle    éil=e          a-nâ’-s-ib=e?
         well    pig=SG.M 3SG.M.O-kill.PFV-RPST-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=Q
         ‘Well, did they kill the pig?’ [Mianmin and Telefomin history]
342      9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseIn (23) above, the object is marked on the verb with the pronominal affix a-
‘third person singular masculine’. The overt object noun phrase can be elided
without affecting the grammaticality of the utterance, as in (24):(24)     a-nâ’-s-ib=e?
         3SG.M.O-kill.PFV-RPST-2/3PL.AN.SBJ=Q
         ‘Well, did they kill him?’
9.2.3.     Transitives with object suffix (indirective aligment)Subclass 3 of transitive verbs consists of verbs which index their object with a
pronominal object suffix. In the perfective, such objects can only be
introduced into the argument structure of a verb through a compound with
-ûb- ‘give (PFV)’, to which the object suffix is appended. In the imperfective,
object suffixes directly attach to the stem (see section 8.5.5). If a verb
obligatorily has an object suffix, this is indicated by a dash following the stem,
e.g. fote- ‘chase away, rout’ (25) or dei-/— ‘leave’ (26).(25)     y         Klefol=i         tata      ke-n-ib=a

         go.PFV-REAL-3SG.M.SBJ         because
         ‘because he was utterly terrified, …’ (lit. ‘his soul left him there and
         went’) [Crows]
                                                           9.2. Transitives   343As verbs of this type always need -ûb- ‘give (PFV)’ with an applicative
function in the perfective, they look derived. However, they – at least
synchronically – do not have an intransitive base from which they could be
derived, i.e. there is no verb *fote, cf. example (25).
    All verb stems that belong to subclass 3 of transitive verbs are given in the
list below:(27)   al tlia-   ‘be angry (PFV)’
       atli-      ‘be angry (IPFV)’
       da-        ‘help’
       dei-       ‘leave (PFV)’
       doko-      ‘forget (PFV)’
       en-        ‘pain, hurt (IPFV)’
       fote-      ‘chase away, rout’
       gai-       ‘pass, surpass (PFV)’
       go-        ‘like, appreciate (PFV)’
       mele-      ‘touch, feel (PFV)’
       men-       ‘touch, feel (IPFV)’
       wai-       ‘wait for (PFV)’The verbs en- ‘pain’ and go- ‘like, appreciate’ are exceptional in that they do
not require object suffixes to be present in the verbal noun. For these two
verbs two forms exist, one with and one without object suffix. Thus, en- has
the verbal nouns (28) and (29):(28)   en-ye-m-in
       pain.IPFV-PL.AN.R-IPFV-VN
       ‘(event of) hurting us/you/them’(29)   en-in
       pain.IPFV-VN
       ‘(event of) hurting’The verb go- ‘like, appreciate’ has the verbal nouns (30) and (31):(30)   go-ˆb’-e-nam-in
       like-give.PFV-PL.AN.R-PFV-VN
       ‘(instance of) liking us/you/them’(31)   go-n-in
       like-AUX-VN
       ‘(event of) liking’.
344      9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clauseFor all other verbs in the list in (27) the object suffix is obligatorily part of the
verbal noun:(32)     fote-ˆb’-e-nam-in / *fote-nam-in
         rout-give.PFV-PL.AN.R-PFV-VN
         ‘(instance of) routing us/you/them’One perception verb and some verbs denoting physiological or psychological
states belong to the subclass of transitive verbs which obligatorily index their
object (i.e. the experiencer) with a suffix. Example (33) shows the use of the
perception verb mele-/men- ‘touch, feel’. Example (34) illustrates —/en- ‘hurt,
pain’:(33)     mele-ˆb’-a-s-o=a
         touch.PFV-give.PFV-3SG.M.R-DS.SEQ-3SG.F.SBJ=MED         me-m-s-e=a

         head=SG.N1 hurt.IPFV-2SG.R-IPFV-3SG.N1.SBJ=Q
         ‘Is your head hurting?’
9.2.4.     Transitives without object affixAlthough the transitive verbs of subclass 4 never cross-reference their object
they nonetheless have objects. For a more detailed treatment of this issue, see
3.14.2 on the grammatical relation of object in Mian.
   Compare (35) with an overt object noun phrase and (36) without one:(35)     imen=o          wen-b-i=be
         taro=N1.PL      eat.IPFV-IPFV-1SG.SBJ=DECL
         ‘I am eating taro.’(36)     wen-b-i=be
         eat.IPFV-IPFV-1.SG.SBJ=DECL
         ‘I am eating (it).’
                                                             9.2. Transitives   345The existence of these verbs shows that Mian is not fully head-marking at the
clause level. For these verbs, there is neither head-marking nor dependent-
marking.
    As with the other three types of transitive verb, the object noun phrase of
transitive verbs in the fourth subclass tends to be elided if referent identity is
recoverable from context or speech situation or if its identity is irrelevant. The
normal situation for any transitive verb is to occur without overt object noun
phrases in Mian discourse.
    Hence, transitives without cross-referencing object affixes might seem
difficult to separate from intransitive verbs in many instances. However, there
is both a syntactic and a semantic criterion which can be used to distinguish
the two from each other.
    Syntactically, transitives without cross-referencing object affixes differ
from intransitives in that they are always capable of having an overt object
noun phrase, which is still understood in case it is dropped. Intransitives can
under no circumstances have overt objects nor do they have elided but
understood objects.
    Semantically, the predications made by transitives without cross-
referencing object affixes can be characterized as involving a participant – in
addition to the participant encoded as subject – which undergoes or is affected
by (or effected/produced by) the action described by the verb. Even though
they might show up without an overt object noun phrase in discourse,
semantically they invariably describe two-place relations.
    An alternative analysis would be to treat transitives without cross-
referencing object affixes as ambitransitives, i.e. verbs which can be used
either transitively or intransitively without any overt derivation. Two types of
ambitransitives are normally distinguished in the literature. The decisive
question is “which of the transitive arguments corresponds to the intransitive
argument (Dixon 1994: 18). In the first type, intransitive S becomes transitive
A, as in ‘I am eating’ vs. ‘I am eating an apple’. In the second type,
intransitive S becomes transitive O, as in ‘the door opened’ vs. ‘I opened the
door’. Following Dixon (2002: 177), I will call these two types of
ambitransitives the “S=A type” and the “S=O type”.
    The alternation illustrated in (35) and (36) could thus be due to the fact that
the verb dowôn’/wen ‘eat’ is an S=A ambitransitive in Mian. However, I have
no evidence whatsoever suggesting (36) illustrates a change in argument
structure, in other words, that the verb becomes intransitive just because the
overt object noun phrase is elided. Therefore, I will reject the S=A
ambitransitive analysis here and recognize a fourth subclass of transitive verbs
whose objects are never indexed but can be freely elided without a change in
argument structure.
346    9. Argument structure and the syntax of the clause    Most transitive verbs which do not index their object occur with inanimate
objects only. Few can have animate objects, e.g. bina/— ‘shoot, pierce’, or
must have animate objects, e.g. bu ‘hunt’ and yo ‘initiate, beget’.
    Other transitive verbs of subclass 4 are: baa/o ‘say’, bafu ‘boil’, bali ‘to
bear (fruit)’, bina/— ‘shoot, pierce’, bu ‘hunt’, dabala/daba ‘make (arrow)’,
fa/faka ‘make (a fire)’, fu ‘cook, smoke’, fubâ ‘wash’, ga ‘cook in a leaf
oven’, ge/gen ‘build, roll, fasten’, gò’/gokà ‘cut (flesh, meat)’, haa ‘weave
(string bag)’, habù ‘obscure, hide’, hena/hen ‘seek’, kimâa’/— ‘look out for,
guard’, klâ ‘fix, complete’, klutâ/klutâ(ka) ‘smash’, maanafa/— ‘cut (cooked
meat)’, ngana/ngaan ‘sing’, nini ‘scrape (taro)’, ou ‘put (arrow head) into
shaft’, sita ‘care for’, ta ‘sharpen’, taye ‘crack open (nut)’, tosiana/tosian
‘fear’, wa ‘adorn with carvings’, went/wentê ‘hear, understand’, yo ‘initiate,
beget’.","[367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372]"
