"    1.2    Major consituent order    Apart from the order of NP constituents described in 11.1.1
    above, the order of various syntactic elements, primarily
    the major constituents S (Subject), 0 (Object) and V (Verb),
    has become a major basis for the typology of languages
    (Greenberg 1963, Comrie 1981, Mallinson and Blake 1981).
    Wagiman has relatively great freedom of constituent order at
!
)
I
    the referential level, and is not easily amenable to a des-
L    cription involving the order of S, V and 0 for a number of
i   reasons.
I    In a morphologically ergative language, the 'subject' is
    usually expressed by two formally different elements: an
    intransitive subject (Si) and a transitive agent (A).     In
    Wagiman, Si and A are formally and morphologically disting-
    uished, and following Mallinson and Blake (1981:123), S is
    split here into Si and A for the purposes of determining the
    order of elements. 0 is distinguished from Si, despite
    formal similarity (both are unmarked Absolutive case), on
functional grounds (see 6.2.1 and 6.2.2. ). The basic cons-
tituents S, V, and 0 have to be expanded to Sip A, v and 0
in any attempt to define basic order.","[311, 312]"
"Nevertheless, an examination of the texts in the Appendix
reveals that some, albeit weak, generalizations about cons-
tituent order are possible.    The texts were chosen as the
corpus for this analysis because of their relative.independ-
ence from English influence on order. They display a strong
freedom of constituent order, and 59 different sentence
(order) types occur. Constituents counted were: A (Agent),
0 (Object), Si (Intransitive subject), V (Verb), P (Parti-
ciple), Obl (Oblique nominal) Inst (Instrumental) and X (any
other item, such as adverbs, locatives or directionals).","[312, 313]"
"        The only fact exhibited by these generalizations is that V .
        tended to follow any overt nominal that occurred; little
        else can be stated with certainty. A 'basic order' of the
        constituents Si, A, 0 and V cannot be determined from such
        data, both because of the lack of any favoured order, but
        also because of the lack of clauses containing two core NPs.
        Wagiman is thus a language for which sentence constituent
        typology is largely irrelevant, because of its lack of a
        basic word order. In conclusion, 'word order1 (the order of
        major constituents) in Wagiman must be described as 'free',
i       but in which the occurrence and order of elements is a func-
    ,
        tion of strong pragmatic constraints.
I        11.3    Simple sentences (verbless equational
I
                constructions)        Simple sentences are those which contain only one predicate
        and are not logically linked to any other clause. Three
        types can be defined: (i) finit.e verb clauses; (ii) part-
        iciple imperative clauses; and (iii) verbless equational
        clauses. Finite clauses with participles are considered to
        be internally 'complex1; their morphology, function and
        semantics were described in Chapter 9, and their syntax is
        treated below in 11.5.
I
I   Participle-only imperatives were described in 9.3, and exam-
    ples of simple finite verb clauses were given in both Chap-
    ters 8 and 9. This section deals with verbless equational
    clauses only.","[317, 318]"
"A further difficulty for the predictive status of word order
typology is that it relies heavily on the presence of adpos-
itions (prepositions or postpositions), particularly in
regard to the order of NP constituents. An entirely affix-
ing language such as Wagiman is thus irrelevant to many
generalizations concerning sentence order (Comrie 1981:85).
The generalizations made of NP order above fall into this
category, and can have no predictive value within the typo-
logy for the rest of the language.",[312]
"A major problem is found in a lack of evidence in the lang-
uage for any 'basic word order', defined as that which holds
in 'stylistically-neutral, independent, indicative clauses
with full noun phrase participants for Si or for A and 0'
(Mallinson and Blake 1981:125).     As for other languages
which represent Si, A and 0 in the verb or by clitics, it is
extremely rare for Wagiman sentences to contain free nominal
expressions of both A and 0, or even Si, providing little
evidence for statements about 'basic' order (op. cit.:129).",[312]
"11.1.1     NP constituent orderAn NP typically consists of two, and occasionally three,
nominals, one of which (the 'head') is semantically modified
by the other(s)   .
                  The relative order of the head and modif-
iers of NPs is not grammatically fixed, although some gen-
eralizations are possible.    Following Greenberg's (1963)
approach to the typology of language on the basis of the
order of sentence elements, modifiers of an NP head nominal
( N ) are categorized here into various classes: demons-
tratives (IDEM'), including all the deictics; adjectival
nominals ('ADJ') which are norninals, including quantifiers,
used in an attributive function; and possessive pronouns
('GEN').   NP constituent order can thus be described in
terms of the order of modifiers relative to N.","[305, 306]"
"Despite the permitted flexibility, there is a distinct syn-
chronic tendency for attributive norninals and possessive
pronouns to follow their head, and an overwhelming tendency
for demonstratives to precede it. The correlation of a
dominant N GEN order with N ADJ order is harmonic from a
universal point of view, where if a language has N GEN order
then it will usually have N ADJ order (Greenberg 1963:79). 1
Similarly, the occurrence of dominant DEM N order is not
unexpected despite a general typological correlation between
demonstrative order and adjective order, because of a fur-
ther marked tendency of N ADJ languages to have DEM N order
(op. cit.:86).","[306, 307]"
"
1
   For SOV languages only, however. Problems arise for
Wagiman in such a typology because it does not have postpos-
itions or normal SOV order which is harmonic with it. Major
constituent order is discussed below in 11.2.

11.1.2    Case suffixes as cliticsThe morphology and semantics of case suffixes were described
in detail in Chapter 6. This section deals with the impli-
cations for the syntax of the fact that typically only one
member of an NP is marked for case. The data indicates that
case suffixes are, in fact, clitics.","[307, 308]"
"The majority of NPs comprise only two elements. The follow-
ing data is taken from material recorded from Douglas Jack
Milguyarri, Lulu Martin Dalpalngali, George Huddleston Yalk-
payarri, and also from the texts in Appendix 1. The non-
narrative text material has been selected as far as possible
from those sessions where speakers' utterances were not exp-
licit translations of English prompt sentences. The orders
N ADJ, N GEN and DEM N were the most common, although other
orders (ADJ N, GEN N and DEM N) also occurred. The raw
scores are as follows:Figure 11-1      NP constituent order         N ADJ        64   N DEM        53   N GEN   42   159

                                                          252In most unelicited speech, the favoured order is N ADJ, N
GEN and DEM N. Elicited translations or examples produced
from an English prompt with ADJ N order in an NP tended to
produce Wagiman NPs with the same order. Variation in NP
constituent order is clearly possible, due perhaps to an
originally flexible order which was modified for discourse
or contextual purposes, or to the influence of English on
what was originally a strict Head-Modifier order.",[306]
"Despite the potential freedom of order for participles rel-
ative to verbs, the texts revealed a tendency for them to
occur directly before the finite verb (56 examples), alth-
ough they also occurred following it (18 examples), with
three examples recorded where some other item occurred bet-
ween V and P (XVSiPX, XVXP and XVPXPX order).      The most
common PV order was, in fact, PV, while the most common VP
order was XVP. The data in Figure 11-3 summarizes the
recorded orders (constituents in parentheses, such as (OP),
indicate that the 0 is an argument of the Participle, not
the finite verb or the predicate as a whole).",[313]
"The constituent 'Vf is also somewhat problematic in Wagiman,
where what can be considered the 'verb' can be expressed by
more than one item; the predicate of a clause can comprise a
finite verb and one or two participles which can have their
own object arguments and ordering possibilities (cf. 9.2.1).",[312]
"In the 12 sentences with two nominal participants (including
free pronouns), no strong order tendencies were found. Only
one of the 12 sentences also contained any other material
apart from the 'V' and the core NPs. 'SiXVO1 in Figure 11-4
represents a copula construction with an Absolutive complem-
ent described as '0' for ordering purposes.

Clearly, a major problem in determining any order is that
usually either A or 0 only, but not both, occurred in trans-
itive clauses as a free nominal, and in clauses that take an
oblique complement often the Oblique only occurred. In the
texts the overwhelming choice for the single overt free
nominal was 0 (43 transitive examples, plus 41 other examp-
les of the verb ya'an 'to say, tell' followed by an Oblique
pronoun), while A occurred overtly only in 4 sentences. In
intransitive clauses, an overt S occurred on 33 occasions:Figux-e 11-5   Single NP clauses               NP as Obl      41
Such a pattern is indicative of two discourse processes in
action. The first is that in narrative discourse, once a
topic is established it is usually referred to only by pro-
nominal reference in the prefix, and' no further overt nom-
inal reference is made to it. Furthermore, the grammatical
role of the topic is not important in such reference because
the general ordering principle of 'topic-to-the-left' (Mall-
inson and Blake 1981.:151) does not affect the position of
the prefix, allowing any grammatical role to be topic with-
out creating ordering conflict. In this way, the topic
marked in the prefix without any nominal referent is 'old'
or previously given information. The second process is one
where new information is introduced by an overt nominal and
occurs earlier in the clause than other material, thus foll-
owing a principle of 'new-before-old'.","[313, 314, 315]"
"7.4      Prefix formsThis section is concerned only with the prefix forms them-
selves. 'Bound pronouns' in Australian languages are usual-
ly treated as having developed from free pronouns (cf. Heath
1976:177, Dixon 1980:363, Blake ms. chapter 6), implying
that at some earlier stage of a language, free form pronouns
became frozen in their position and order before a verb (for
prefixes), and subsequently became fixed to the verb morpho-
logically and phonologically through a re-analysis of their
status.   A comparison of the Wagiman intransitive prefixes
with the free Base pronouns (ignoring for the moment differ-
ent mood and aspect forms) suggests correspondences between
free forms and boulid forms. Dixon's (1980:334-46) 'proto-
    Fixing of word order is not necessary to the account,
however.   Dixon (1980:368) argues that an alternation be-
tween free pronouns and reduced forms, which are attached to
the verb- or sentence-initial item, can be proposed as a
likely route to the develpoment of bound pronouns, rather
than there necessarily having to be an 'intermediate stage'
of fixed word order.
Australian' pronoun reconstructions are also included for
reference.","[215, 216]"
"Because of the consistent link between V and P, their occur-
rence together was counted as a single 'V' for the purposes
of order relative to other constituents, simplifying the
variety of clause order types significantly.",[313]
"    A count indicates that 0 occurred initially or before V
    and/or A in 36 clauses, but followed A or V in 12 clauses
    only (a ratio here of 3 to 1).     The 41 examples of yalan
    followed by an Oblique object can be generally discounted as
    V O(b1) sentences because the construction is a fixed exp-
    ression used to introduce and close direct quotations (see
    particularly text LMD 2 .in Appendix 1 and section 11.4.3
    below).   Si also tended to precede, rather than follow V
    (again in a ratio of approximately 3 to I), as described in
    Figure 11-6:    Figure 11-6   Relative order of Si, A, 0 and V in s i n g l e NP

    Ignoring X material, the following generalizations summarize
    the constituent orders recorded in clauses containing at
    least one NP:
I
               (i)   the most favoured free nominal in two-place
        clauses was 0;              (ii)    when 0 occured as the only free NP, it tended
        to precede V;             (iii)    in intransitive clauses with a free NP sub-
        ject, Si tended to precede V;              (iv)    V was the most common sentence-final constit-
        uent, and 0 was the most common initial item;               (v)    the few clauses containing two core NPs showed
        no clearly favoured orders.","[316, 317]"
"Major constituent order is generally free, although some
order tendencies within constituents can be determined (see
               -.
sections 11.1 and 11.2).
1'   In the phonology, two series of stops are distinguished in
     intervocalic position, and there is also a glottal stop.
                                                                          'v'
     There are five phonemic vowels.","[19, 20]"
"Again, DEM-initial orders are most common, of which exactly
half (14) were DEM N ADJ order, while GEN-initial orders did
not occur at all. Other generalizations are not possible
with such a small number of examples.",[307]
"Polar interrogative sentences are syntactically identical
with declarative sentences, but differ in their intonation
contour; generally, major constituent order is unaffected.
Polar question intonation is not well understood, with few
examples occurring in the tape-recorded corpus.   Auditory
impressions of non-recorded examples indicate that such
     questions have a generally rising intonation over the final
     syllables, in opposition to declaratives which have a gener-
     ally falling final intonation contour. Alternations in word
     order due to pragmatic factors can alter this dramatically,
     with rising intonation occurring over single clause-initial
     items if only they are being queried. However, this is not
     an area that has been well recorded, and no concrete exam-
     ples can be discussed here.","[300, 301]"
"Lulu Martin, on one occasion, gave two consecutive examples
which differ slightly. In one, the comparative nominal
occurs as the subject of the clause, with an Oblique pronom-
inal complement expressing the object of comparison. A
second 'comparative' clause containing an antonym of the
quality being compared also follows the first to express
unambiguously exactly which referent has which quality. An
            8
interesting point in this clause is that the object of com-
parison is stated again as an Oblique pronoun complement of
the verb in either a type of 'impersonal' or 'Oblique sub-
ject' construction: because of ordering flexibility in
general, and the lack of nominal subject marking in particu-
lar, it is not possible to tell which NP is subject of the

"In Chapter 11 areas of the syntax are examined:    NP struc-
ture, constituent order, the syntax of participle construct-
ions, and other syntactic topics.",[17]
"An examination of Ngalakan pronominal prefixes yields a
possible loan source for -dyu-: the form ju- occurs as a
2sg transitive subject prefix in that language (Merlan 1983:
86,88), although the order is wrong for the Wagiman transit-
ive prefix (the 2sg item should precede the 3sg item in the
hierarchy).
A similar problem occurs for the 2sg/lpl form pigu-, which
has lpl reference accounted for by initial gi-, but in which
the 2sg object reference then cannot be unaccounted for; -gu
has no fixed value (apart from 2pl:IPFV) anywhere else in
the system. Many phonetic changes have obviously occurred
to obscure the earlier shape of most prefixes. The recons-
tructions are summarized in Figure 7-8; question marks ind-
icate where the source of a segment or form is unknown, or
the reconstruction is particularly uncertain.","[226, 227]"
"The following sections describe NP constituent order and
case marking respectively.",[305]
"Person and number hierarchies are common for bound pronouns
in Australian (and other) languages (cf. Heath 1976, Silver-
stein 1976, Blake 1977).    These hierarchies usually place
pronouns in the approximate order: 1st person > 2nd person
> 3rd person, and are also found in languages nearby to
            %
where Wagiman was traditionally spoken.    In Rembarnga the
patient always precedes the agent in transitive prefixes
(Blake 1977:27).   The same is also the case for Kunwinjku,
but subject to certain other hierarchical constraints ('Gun-
winggu' in Blake 1977:33). The ordering in Wagiman prefixes
is based on a person/number hierarchy alone, although the
neutralizations in the system make an exact description of
the hierarchy dificult to formulate.","[222, 223]"
"Portmanteau prefixes on finite verbs usually carry two or
three pieces of information: person and number of the Sub-
ject or Agent and Object, and mood and/or aspect. The gloss
for prefixes has the information ordered in the following
way: either S:ASPECT or A/O:ASPECT. For example, a second
person singular intransitive Imperfective prefix would have
the gloss '2sg:IPFV'; a transitive Perfective prefix with a
third person singular agent and a second person plural
object would have the gloss '3sg/2pl:PFV1. In all transit-
ive prefix glosses, the agent value precedes the patient,
for example:        ga'an   lagiban qundyu-bu-ni           [DLB 841

"As a definite article, it always precedes the nominal it is
modifying, identical with the use of definite article 'the'
in English, and leading to the possible conclusion that this
particular use of ga1an, or at least the word order, is the
result of influence from English. A further problem is the
fact that, in any case, the order of modifying nominals
relative to an NP head is not fixed, with the result that
deictics can also follow the NP head. 3The definite article interpretation of ga'an is not always
clearly distinguishable from a demonstrative interpretation
3 There is some apparently ivlmns;sScv\&   data on order of
elements within the NP, and it is now difficult to recons-
truct what the original system may have been, or whether it
has changed or not; see 21.1.
    I        without appropriate context, and often speakers will provide
        translations of the same example with both 'the' and 'that1.
        An appreciation of the context of these examples is thus
        important for their appropriate translation. Because many
        examples given here were recorded without much previous
        context (due to the fact that they may have been elicited
        translations of English sentences, but also because of the
        difficulties involved in recording more spontaneous utter-
        ances in the field), there is often an indeterminacy of
        translation ranging from examples where ga'an is obviously a
        definite article, to examples where it is obviously a demon-
        strative. There are also the examples which fall somewhere
        in between these two poles. In all cases, ga'an is glossed
        as 'that1, and any definite article interpretation is given
        in the free translation following the example.","[132, 133]"
"Interference from English, however, still cannot be ruled
out as the source of the DEM N order particularly. The
function of the medial demonstrative ga'an 'that, there' as
a definite article, and its occurrence before a head nomi-
nal, were discussed in 5.4.1.2 as possibly reflecting a bor-
rowing from English. The innovative use of ga'an in such a
way could have caused a general shift of the other demons-
tratives to the same order position. None of the speakers
whose language was recorded was brought up outside the inf-
luence of English, and whether the original situation was as
currently indicated cannot now be determined.",[307]
"Australian languages which permit the occurrence of 'deri-
vational' suffixes after 'inflectional' suffixes have proved
more problematic: examples from Jiwarli (Austin 1985) and
Kayardild (Evans 1985:65-6) illustrate contrastive variation
in the ordering of suffixes following a nominal root. Evans
(ibid.) has argued that the principle of 'concentric scop-
ing', rather than 'inflection' and 'derivation', orders
suffixes in Kayardild in such a way that they have logical
scope over the entire preceding stem. Evans and Dench (ms.)
argue further that the same principle applies in most Aust-
ralian languages, and can be used to account for ordering
characteristics normally described by the inflection/deri-
vation parameter.   The tendency of particular suffixes to
occur in the same position relative to the root and other
suffixes can thus be explained in terms oi their individual
meaning.",[142]
"The ranking of 2pl > 3sg can be determined from guggu-,
where pa- represents second person plural.     Because it is
not possible to determine the position of the so-called
' zero morpheme' for 3sg objects (for example, 2sg/3sg could
be 9+gi- or qi+g-), then 3sg cannot be strictly ordered
relative to other persons when it is a patient .6 Given that
lpl and 2pl can be seen to precede it when it is an agent,

    Tryon (1971:9), however, does attempt to order a 3sg
'zero morpheme' before the overt prefix form gin-, glossed
by him as 'us two', so that the '3sg acting on ldu' prefix
is analysed as @-gin 'he-us two'. Such an analysis is
observationally inadequate, and confuses s theoretical con-
struct with morphological reality; no evidence of any order
can be provided when one of the elements is consistently
null.
however, then it can be placed lower than 2sg as well.
Because 3sg is below 2pl and lpl, then it is likely that it
is also below lsg. The indications from this limited evi-
dence are that the following tentative hierarchy can be                Tentative pronominal hierarchy                lsg, (possibly lpl)
                (possibly lpl), 2sg, 2pl
Apart from being able to identify the initial syllable as
representing one of the two pronominal referents, there is
very little more identification of pronominal reference that
can be extracted synchronically. The system would presum-
ably have been open to analysis at some earlier stage, but
neutralizations and phonological change have severely red-
uced the transparency of much of the matrix.","[223, 224]"
"Class terms are invariable, and are used to 'order persons'
(Maddock 1982:90).   Wagiman society had eight classes in an
indirectly matrilineal 'subsection' system, for which clear
material has been recorded. Each individual in such a sys-
tem was a member of one class only for their entire life;

"    Furthermore, there appears to be a strong tendency for mod-
    ifiers to follow, or more importantly, to be interpreted
    only as following, their head in such NPs. This is not

    internal constituent order is less fixed. The possibility    1

"Finite clause participle constructions are also character-
ized by several structural and semantic generalizations
concerning the various relationships that hold between fin-
ite verb and participle(s):       (i)    the participle in single participle finite
clause constructions usually (but not necessarily always)
directly precedes the finite verb in the clause (cf. 11.2);      (ii)    no more than two participles have been rec-
orded in any one finite clause; where two do occur, their
order relative to other major clausal constituents and each
other is less fixed than in single participle constructions;     (iii)    participles need not agree formally with each
other or the finite verb in respect of aspect marking, but
the value of any such marking on any one item always applies
to the clause as a whole, and not only to the relevant indi-
vidual items;      (iv)    participles and finite verbs combine to form
simultaneous, compound meanings, and always complement each
other's meaning; incongruous semantic or pragmatic combin-
ations do not occur; and
              the co-occurrence of participles and finite
verbs is relatively unrestricted, and participles can occur
with other particioles and different finite verbs within the
broad limits stated in (iv) above.","[260, 261]"
"    115.1   General considerations    Wagiman finite verb participle constructions display some
    structural similarities to multi-part predicate construct-
    ions in other languages in the region, in which one element
    inflects for mood and/or tense and/or pronominal reference,
    and the other is uninflected and perhaps not obligatory; in
    many of these languages, the terms 'auxiliary' and '(main)
    verb' or 'particle', or other terminological variants, are
    used to describe the various elements.     Often, the 'part-
    icle' is not free, and is connected in some way to the 'aux-
    iliary. Constructions relatively similar to those found in        See, for example, Reid 1982, Heath 1978a, 1980c, 1981,
    Tryon 1974, 1976, Merlan 1982, and also other descriptions
    in Dixon 1976:613-768.
Wagiman occur in Mangarayi, where the non-inflec.ting ele-
ments, described as 'particles', are free items and are not
attached phonologically or morphologically to their I aux-
iliary' (Merlan 1982:52). 4Functional similarities between Mangarayi particles and
Wagiman participles are broad, but differences are also
clearly discernable, particularly in the lack of aspect
marking on Mangarayi particles, and the semantic dominance
of the particle in expressing the meaning of the verbal
construction (op. cit.:124),Nevertheless, a simple 'particle + auxiliary' analysis is
essentially unsatisfactory for Wagiman because it fails to
take into account the fact that participles are quite dis-     '
tinct predicates in their ability to have individual object
and subject arguments; the transitivity of a clause can be
altered by the transitivity of the participle, and in
already transitive clauses, a further overt nominal argument
can be introduced into the clause (see 9.2.1; transitivity
has also been discussed in 6.2.1).  Moreover, the subject or.
agent of participles and the finite verb in a clause need
not be identical, as in switch subject and multiple object
constructions, while in some others (ambient constructions),
participles share no arguments at all with the finite verb
(again, see 9.2.1 above).   In a 'particle + aux' structure,
the particle is assumed to have the same arguments as the
aux, and the two are given effectively as a unit verbal
constituent; this is clearly not the case in Wagiman parti-
ciple structures,
* In the Pama-Nyungan language Warlpiri , spoken well to the
south of both Wagiman and Mangarayi, some 'adverbial pre-
verbs' can also be separated from their 'main verb' , either
to a position directly following the verb instead of direct-
ly preceding it, or to sentence-final position (Nash 1982:
180-1).
Furthermore, the participle and finite verb combine to form
semantically productive, complex lexical meanings, and
neither finite verbs nor participles can be said consistent-
ly to carry more of the semantic load than the other; the
finite verb is more than just a 'prop1 for inflection (an
auxiliary) as in Mangarayi (Merlan 1982:52).       In simple
finite clauses, in which a finite verb occurs without a
participle, any 'aux' function to be defined at all is car-
ried, not by the verb root, but the prefix: it is marked
for tense and mood and occurs in first position, satisfying
two out of the three characteristics of ' A U X ' defined by
Steele et al. (1981:155-6). The third characteristic, that
aux occurs as a constituent, is more problematic on a level
of theoretical syntax not under discussion here.    In finite
participle clauses, the logical candidate for any auxiliary
remains the same. In all cases, finite verbs are lexically
full items, and remain so in participle clauses. Some other
approach is required.","[332, 333, 334]"
"Apart from boda 'die', one other participle has been rec-
orded in a switch-subject construction; it is a somewhat
unusual example because it refers to a non-traditional event
in Aboriginal culture. In 9-6 it is clearly the horses, and
not their owners, who are going racing; the object of the
finite verb ga- 'to take' (the horses) occurs as the 'sub-
ject' of the participle duduta 'run':9-6      guba-ya-min        amu~al,           nendo    duduta

         'They are going to Adelaide River for the horse
         races.' (Lit.      '...
                              to take the horses running.')In 'multiple object ' serial verb constructions there may be
either same-subject or switch-subject identity between seri-
alized verbs, each of which is transitive, but each of which
has its own object (Crowley 1984:5).    In 'multiple object'
participle constructions, the participle is also transitive
and has a different nominal object from that of the finite
verb.   This effectively allows the inclusion of a second
overt patient nominal in the clause. Crowley (ibid.) states
that such serial verb constructions are diachronically un-
stable, and it is interesting to note that in Wagiman they
are also very rare.",[263]
"Convincing evidence for the application of the principle in
a particular language can be found in examples where trad-
itionally named derivational suffixes can occur, with cont-
rastive meaning, after inflectional suffixes. No such clear
variation has been recorded for Wagiman, although some inde-
terminate evidence exists in the form of two examples where
a 'derivationalf suffix has been recorded occuring after a
case suffix. It has not been possible to repeat them, or to
elicit further similar types; they are discussed in 6.3.1
and 6.3.5 below.
I       A contrast between nominal suffix types in Wagiman along
        different grounds can be proposed, however, on the basis of
        'case' and non-case' functions.    'Case' suffixes are those
        which relate an NP syntactically to a verb or predicate, and
        include such relations as Agent of a transitive clause, Goal
                                                                   2
        of motion, Purpose of the predicate action, and so forth.
        'Non-case' suffixes code relations that hold for nominals
i
I       within and over an NP. This would include relations such as
    )   Comitative and Plural, although, whilst the Comitative suf-
        fix expresses a relation that holds between individual nomi-
        nal members of an NP, the Plural suffix indicates a relation
        that holds -
                   over the members of an NP; neither suffix relates
        the NP itself to the verb or clause as a whole. 3        The order oP case and non-case suffixes following the nomi-
        nal root in Wagiman, despite being relatively fixed, can
        still be considered within the notion of 'concentric' scop-
        ing': the last suffix is usually that one which has scope
        over the entire NP and relates it to the verb or.predicate.
        Non-case suffixes might only relate one nominal to another
        in the NP (such as, for example, the Comitative suffix), and
        the principle of concentric scope would therefore apply to
        order them before any case suffix which has greater scope.","[142, 143]"
"In order to avoid duplication of description, the finite
verb use of these suffixes will be described here, rather
than in Chapter 7 on finite verb affixing morphology. When
they occur on finite verbs, number suffixes are usually the
last item following tense and aspect suffixes; if there are
none, they directly follow the root.",[175]

"
6.5.1    Social organization and subsectionsWagiman society was almost certainly based on distinctions
made through kin and class systems, as in most other Aust-
ralian Aboriginal societies (Maddock 1982:81pp).    Kin sys-
tems are based on egocentric classifications, in which add-
ress and reference terms vary with point of view; an indi-
vidual can stand in different kin relations to different
people. Data on Wagiman kinship terms and the original
system is particularly sparse. I have recorded a number of
Wagiman kinship terms, but the system is no longer used or
well known; even old speakers provided confusing and contra-
dictory information in this area, and I have been unable to
record any reliable material in order to study the system in
detail.",[29]
"    Structurally, participles exhibit features typical of serial
    verbs, including a limited ability to occur in switch-sub-
    ject, multiple-object and ambient constructions. Semantic-
    ally, serial verb constructions can be considered as an
    interface between syntax and lexicon in that the meaning of
    various types of construction is fixed lexically, despite
    their productive nature in other ways (cf. Pawley 1980).
    Ambient and switch-subject constructions fall into this
    category: it is not possible to predict from the syntax why
the object of the finite verb is the subject of the parti-
ciple in a switch-subject construction (see examples 9-4 to
9-6), nor why ambient constructions do not have a more lit-
eral meaning, where the subject of the finite verb is also
the subject of the participle (see example 9-8).","[337, 338]"

"In the same corpus, 42 examples of NPs comprising three
nominals were recorded. Using the same four classifications
(N, ADJ, DEM, GEN) , 24 order types are possible if no more
than one occurrence of each nominal type occurs in any NP;
only 12 actually occurred, however. These are given in
Figure 11-2.",[307]
"    The intransitive forms are given in the transitive matrix
    (Figure 7-2) as marking 3sg objects. This is not strictly
    true in formal terms, however, because no separate identif-
    ication of the object can be made from the forms themselves:
    they mark an intransitive subject only, or the agent only of
    a transitive clause with a 3sg patient. Rather than propose
    that the same forms are used 'transitively' to mark 3sg
    patients with a zero marked patient, and then 'intransitiv-
    ely' to cover 3sg subject function with no patient, the data
    in fact indicates that 3sg objects merely remain unmarked in
    the sytem.",[230]
"The description of participles in the following sections is
according to their structural and semantic features. Part-
icular examples sometimes occur more than once in different
places, mainly because they can exhibit more than one rele-
vant feature. Semantic features of participles, particular-
ly in finite clauses, often cut across structural features,
and structure and meaning do not always necessarily fully
correspond: although two particular sentences might appar-
ently involve the same type of construction, quite different
meanings can result due to the individual lexical meanings
of the participles. The following section on the structure
of finite participle clauses provides typical examples of
their semantic nature which is expanded upon in later sect-9-2.1 Structural nature of finite participle clausesA structural characteristic of serial verb constructions
generally is a restriction on the nominal arguments assoc-
iated with each verb in the sentence (Bradshaw 1982:28, in
Crowley 1984:3, Foley and Olson 1985:24).   This restriction
expresses itself as the requirement of identity of either
subject or object (agent or patient) betveen serialized
verbs.   A similar situation is to be found here, and the
participles and the finite verb in a clause normally have
one nominal argument in common. Within this view, finite
clause participle structures can be analysed similarly to
serial verb constructions as being either 'same-subject',
switch-subject ' (from Crowley. 1984, Foley and Olsen 1985)
or 'multiple object' constructions (from Durie 1982, in
Crowley 1984:4-5).   A further type in which the serialized
verb has no clausal argument, called 'ambient' constructions
(Crowley 1984:5) can also be identified.
In same-subject constructions, both the participle and the
finite verb have the same nominal subject or agent. This is
also the most common participle sentence type to be found
(in all the following participle examples, the participle is
underlined; unmarked participles are not overtly indicsted
in the inter-linear gloss):9-1      ba-di-nya-gin          maluga            qalmatiwa-giwu

"     However, the Ergative case marker can also occur on the
     overt nominal subject of an intransitive verb in a clause
     which also contains a transitive participle:     6-4     qagun-yi    ber '-ri    qa-di-gin        [DJM 4841

The finite verbs di-nya 'to comef and ya-ggi 'to go' cannot
have more than one argument (a Subject), so the implied
object 'river' in 6-4 and the overt object hill' in 6-5
belong to the participle; the Ergative case marking thus
reflects their transitivity rather than that of the finite
verb. Participle constructions are examined further in
Chapter 9 and 11.5 below.","[145, 146]"
"    4.1     Nominals    Nominals form an open class defined as those lexical items
    which can carry case and other suffixes (described in Chap-
    ter 6 below), and which can occur in the central grammatical
    roles of Agent, Patient and Subject. Nominals do not neces-
    sarily have to be able to occur with all nominal suffixes,
    but the occurrence of one such'suffix on an item is suffic-
    ient to determine its status as a nominal. In notional
    terms, most nominals describe the names of people, places
    and real-world objects, and some would thus be called
    'nouns' in traditional part-of-speech systems.
Within the class of nominals, various sub-classes can be
determined, as follows:       (1)    Pronouns: nominals which refer to the speech
act participants themselves, and which can have anaphoric
reference to other nominals;      (ii)    Demonstratives: nominals which indicate ref-
erence to a particular nominal, or to a real world object or
place through reference to the speech act participants as
loci of relative proximity;     (iii)    Interrrogative pro-forms:   nominals which
function as interrogative items, and which have meanings
such as 'what', ' whof, 'where' etc.","[105, 106]"
"In 9-30 for example, where the sun is 'exiting', ( 'coming
up') it is apparent that it is the subject of both the 'com-
ing' and the 'exiting'. In 9-31, however, where the lexical
meaning of the finite verb and participle compound is 'to
vomit', it is not obvious that the subject of the finite
verb 'to eat1 (in this case, lsg) is also 'exiting'.      In
fact, it would seem here that the object of the finite verb
(the water) is the subject of the participle. However, in
another sense, the subject of the finite verb is also the
subject of the participle when the clause is translated as
'I ate the water in an outwards manner'.",[273]
"Commands, and examples where the command has the perlocutive
effect of causing the action of the command to take place
(where ya'an has the sense of 'to order'), code the addres-
see directly in the verb pronominal prefix.        When the
addressee is an Oblique, there seems to be no required
interpretation that the reported utterance is a command
(although it can be one), and no perlocutionary effects are
implied; direct addressee examples of ya'an usually require
such an interpretation, however, and perlocutionary effects
are often implied.",[241]
"Mono-syllabic verb roots exist, but become poly-syllabic
stems with the addition of obligatory prefixes and optional
suffixes (see Chapter 7 generally below).    Potential open
mono-syllabic words are also usually avoided by the addition
of an optional suffix to the root. For example, the verb
root ya- 'to go' is potentially able to occur as an open
syllable mono-syllabic word when it is coded for a 3sg sub-
ject and Perfective aspect (marked by zero morphological
realization in the prefix series; cf. Figure 7-1). Because
aspect and tense suffixes are optional, a potential CV mono-
syllabic word * e y a would be created if the root were left
unsuffixed.   In actuality, however, the Past tense marker
i    is always used to create the di-syllabic word 9-ya-ggi
'he/ she/it went'. 2The copula verb root yu- 'to be' can also potentially occur
as an open mono-syllable for the same reason, but a synonym-
ous di-syllabic root n i p i - also exists. Speakers from the
south-west of the Wagiman traditional area, such as Don
Liddy Balambal, and others in Pine Creek, always use nigi-
when the verb is coded for 3sg Perfective (ie. is marked
with 9-), and carries no tense suffix.       A potential open
syllable monosyllabic word is thus avoided, even though ya-
is used commonly in other situations and with different
tense and aspect values.
                                           \
Closed syllable mono-syllabic words are acceptable, but only
occur for finite verbs when a mono-syllabic verb stem is
suffixed with the Punctual aspect marker - 0 , such as 9-bu-0
'He/she/it hit (it), or when a di-syllabic participle loses
its final syllable for Punctual aspect marking, as in gal'
'climb-PCT', from gal'ma 'climb-UNM'.

"    When the genitive head is an overt free nominal, the Posses-

    of modifier and head elements of most NPs, there is the
    potential for ambiguity of whether the modifer is part of
    the head or the possessed item. Furthermore, when both the
    genitive head arad the possessed item are 3sg or 3p1, the
    Possessive pronoun could potentially refer to either the
    possessor or the possessed nominal.",[116]
