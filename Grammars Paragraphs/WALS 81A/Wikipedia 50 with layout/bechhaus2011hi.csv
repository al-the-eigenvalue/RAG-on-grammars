11.3.5 Relative ClausesSeveral ways to construct a relative clause are documented in Old Nobiin texts.
These different constructions deserve a thorough analysis which would go be-
yond the scope of this study. Fortunately, some detailed preliminary investigation
has been done by Browne (1988) and Satzinger (1990) which serves as basis for
the short presentation and discussion of some Old Nobiin examples from reli-
gious as well as documentary texts. The presentation to a large extent follows
Satzinger’s categorization of the different types of relative constructions. Finally,
corresponding examples from Modern Nobiin will be discussed.
    In relative clauses, a participle, subjunctive or predicative can be found. Op-
tionally, it may be introduced by the demonstrative pronoun in ‘this’. Satzinger
(1990:187) distinguishes three basic types which,                   few modifications included,
are (with formalized examples):
Il. noun   + noun-oB)      + participle
   itu     sak-ka_pes-il
   man     word    say-PARTPRES
   ‘the man who says the word’ = lit.: ‘the man saying the word’2. noun + noun-GEN + participle
   salu     _it-in        pes-il
   word man-GEN say-PARTPRES
   ‘the word, which the man said = lit.: ‘the word the saying of the man’
                                                                                            207
3. noun + subjunctive
      salu      pes-in
      word      say-3SGPRESSUB
         ‘the word, he says’A prototypical type | relative clause is found in the following example from the
Nicene Canons:
(NC 29,11)
tillu.      tak-ka    au-ol-ka                   air-a-lo
god         he-OB)     make-PARTPRETI-OB) _ insult-PRED-EMPH
‘(he) insults the god who made him’Although not morphologically marked as such ‘illu is the object of the clause and
therefore the participle is marked as object. The pronominal subject is not ex-
pressed.
   A type 3 relative clause is documented in the following example from a docu-
mentary text. The referent is marked as object:
(IT 111 37, 15-16)
silim-in             maria-n      pakkatti-ka    pare-n     pakkatti-lo     pel-in
Ibrim-GEN            Mary-GEN     share-OB)      land-GEN   share-in        come-out-3SGPRESSUB
 “the share of the Mary (church) of Ibrim which consists of a share of land’ The first example from the Mena legend is a complex sentence consisting of an
 interrogative, a relative and a purpose clause. Furthermore, it is a direct speech
 statement:
                                                                                ous       fal Sevag
 (M. 8, 15-9, 4)                                                                              1
 papo iru            in-ka       anki-min-na-i                                 Feu        uensna_—s   ekka
 father you          this-OBJ    remember-NEG-2SGPRESIND-INTERROG             woman       one-GEN     us den-j-is}ka                          Dissu mina-n          kisse-la      _tij-j-ana-sa
 give-OBJPL-PARTPRETII-OBJ             holy     Mina-GEN     church-in    give-PL-IMPERPL-saying, ‘father, don’t you remember this which a woman gave to us in order that we might (it) give to the
 church of St. Mena’ The first part of this sentence is a variant of type 2 above. The first noun is re-
 placed by an interrogative clause the object of which serves as referent for the
 relative clause. The relative clause is marked                           as participle and the preceding
 noun is in the genitive. The object of the main clause in-ka ‘this’ is also the ob-
 ject of the relative clause. Again, the verb in the relative clause is nominalized,
 and therefore the subject of the relative clause ittu uen- is marked as genitive.
  Both elements, the referent and the participles take the suffix of the object which
 marks the whole construction as an appositive clause.","[207, 208]"

her house-in     be-PREDPRETI           _all-PL-SUB)-also-and     barren-PRED-PL-EMPH   be-3PLPRETIIIND
 ‘and also all who were in her house were barren’ Here, we find a predicative periphrastic construction (see chapter 9) in mir-a-
gue-lo is-sana with a literal meaning of approximately ‘they were the being
barren’. Again, the relative clause is marked as predicative, mifJan- ‘all’ is the
referent and takes the suffix of the subjective. This is an example for Type 3
construction because the main verb is in the indicative.
    Finally, Satzinger (1990:196) lists an additional type of relative clause which
is characterized by a referent with predicative ending followed by -sin. The latter
is one of all in all three elements which Browne (1997) described as Old Nobiin
emphatic particles and which fulfilled a wide range of different functions. The
relative clause has either the participle or the subjunctive.
    In a sales contract from Qasr Ibrim, we find such a construction in a documen-
tary context:
(IT III 37, 19-20)
jan-a-sin            etti-ji-sil-gu-I-lon                         nap-il     20-lo
price-PRED-COP       receive-OBJPL-PARTPRETII-PL-SUBJ-and         gold-SUBJ 20-COP
‘and the price which I received is 20 gold’Again, the first part consists of a nominal sentence. Predicative -a- is enforced by
-sin. A noun in the predicative followed by -sin as referent of a relative clause is
also documented several times in the more formal religious texts (Browne 1996).
The verb of the relative clause is a participle preterit II marked as plural subjec-
tive because the price consists of several pieces of gold. Literally, the meaning of
the whole sentence is ‘it is 20 gold it is the price having been received’.
   In Modern Nobiin, various changes conceming the construction of relative
clauses can be observed. As has been mentioned before predicative and subjunc-
tive have disappeared and also the once omnipresent emphatic/focus/copulative
particles -/o and -sin were lost.
    Instead of the lost constructions, Modern Nobiin occasionally employs two
clauses marked as indicatives, one of which functions as main, the other one as
relative clause, as in:
                                                                                                    211
(GM I1,2)

never     one     it-OB)     mount-3SGPRETNEG‘you will find a donkey’s foal tied which no one has ever mounted’The literal meaning of this bible quotation is ‘you will find a donkey’s foal, it is
tied, no one ever mounted it’. Although this is not rendered in the English trans-
lation there seems to be two relative clauses in the Nubian version. As in one of
the examples from old Nobiin above, one relative clause is embedded between
the referent and its modifier which both have the suffixes of the objective case.
The literal meaning of the clause is ‘a donkey’s foal which is tied’ and the stative
verb is marked as indicative. The subject of the relative clause is the object of the
main clause. The second relative clause is juxtaposed and has the suffixes of the
negative indicative. A new subject is introduced in the second relative clause but
its object is identical to the object of the main clause.
    More often, we find relative clauses with participles, as in the next two exam-
ples from the gospel of St. Mark:
(GM 5.32)
gelb-on                     (iden             saw-ohe              tiiraa
look around-3SGPRET           woman           do-PARTPRET-OBJ      to‘and he looked around to the woman who had done this’(GM 15.46)
kunir-oos-on           turba {mutee-1 finda-fi-i]                            weellaa
bury-DIR-3SGPRET tomb               hill-in     quarry out-STAT-PART         one-in
‘he buries him in a tomb which had been hewn out in the rock’t is interesting to note that although Nobiin is basically a verb final language the
main verb is clause initial in both instances. Also in both sentences, the main
verb is followed by a postpositional phrase into which the relative clause is em-
bedded. The postposition is clause final. Only in the first example, however, the
participle is marked as object.
    In the Ermenne narrative, we find various examples with participles in the
relative clauses. The following one shows the expected word order with the ref-
erent in front and the main verb in clause final position:
(Erm. 15)
wide[ideni (in-wilit-ta                   hidm-i ))——_iig-a-tir-on
then     “woman    this-boy-OBJ           serve-PARTPRES        say-ADJ-BEN-3SGPRET‘then the woman who served the boy said to him’
212
 The following example shows striking similarities to some of the Old Nobiin
 examples because the pronominal subject of the relative clause is marked as
 genitive. The referent, on the other hand, is marked as object according to its re-
 lationship to the subject of the relative clause, as opposed to its status in the main
 clause.
 (GM 11,21)
 nal          sajara-gaa__ir-iin        nal-siinii          sam-oos-on
 look         tree-OBJ      you-GEN     curse-PARTPRETII    wither-DIR-3SGPRET ‘look, the tree which you cursed has withered’In the next example, two different constructions are employed to express relative
clauses:
(Erm 31)
ir-minga-iye [...]         faala-nadiif-tol-la_—_ikka         udr-eedaag-a-te-rii            mug-0s-a

juu diidee {uburt-in-koci-la_okk-a-fi-i}ka                                  kab-o
go      pot         ashes-GEN-top-on        cook-ADJ-STAT-PARTPRES-OB)      cat-2SGINTPRET‘why [...] did you leave that which I put on the clean plate for you, go to the pot, which cooks on the
ashes, and eat’The main clause is marked as interrogative and consists of a verbal complex with
a pronominal subject ir mug-os-a juu kab-o ‘did you leave, go, eat?’. The relative
clause is represented by a present indicative, udr-eedaag-a-te-rii, the other one
by a participle marked as object, okk-a-/fi-i-ka. The first one takes the position of
the object of the transitive verb mug- ‘leave’, the second one modifies the loca-
tive noun phrase ‘diidee’.
(Erm. 77)
takka mallek-ka           _aag-ig-a-tee-i                  murti-lin-aiya
him       all-op)         HAB-Say-ADJ-BEN-PARTPRES         horse-COP-[DS]‘(saying-) it is the horse who tells him all’The conversion of constituents results in an OVS word order with the logical
subject in sentence final position. The copula -/in is added which regularly ex-
presses identity of two nouns or pronouns. Here, the second noun is the unex-
pressed subject of the relative clause.
   Lepsius (1880:67ff.) describes an independent relative pronoun faa in his
grammar. Werner (1987:128) addresses Lepsius’ suggestion but is doubtful about
the actual function of faa. He cites Almkvist (1911:248) and von Massenbach
(1933:214) who translate ‘only’ which also corresponds to a translation given by
one of Abel’s informants (Abel 1913:50). Werner’s isolated examples, such as
                                                                                                             213
ay taa ay lii, allow the translation ‘I am who I am’ as well as ‘I am only I’. It
helps to look at the following example from Lepsius’ translation of the gospel
because it documents faa followed by the Arabic loan bes ‘only’.
(GM 2,26)
kaba    mugaddaas-ka_        kab-on           taa    bes      kaahiin-ii   kab-innan
bread   holy-OB)             eat-3SGPRET      REL    only     priest-PL     eat-3PLPRES
‘he ate the consecrated bread which only priests eat’As it seems improbable that ‘only’ is rendered twice in one clause, the example
can be regarded as evidence for the use of faa as an element which introduces
relative clauses.
   Amongst several different contexts Abel documents fa(a) in his narrative.
There is one which seems to correspond to Lepsius’ example:
(Erm. 76)
ta-in         eye          irin   kene    simark-a-fi-e-[y]                         ai-logo   mola-ije
REL-DEM?      [she said]   your   so     be angry-ADJ-STAT-INFPRES{she said]        I-to      close-[she said]‘this which [she said] makes you angry-[she said], is easy for me’
The literal meaning of the sentence is ‘that which is your being angry about, is
close to me’. Whether -in actually represents the demonstrative or is a remnant of
-in ‘to be’ is difficult to decide.
      Lepsius (1880:391) documents another context in which faa is used:
(GM 2,10)
taa  uk-koo     n_irber-okom
FIN     you-PL-and   know-2PLPRES‘and so that you may know’Here, faa seems to introduce a final clause. All things considered there isn’t
enough evidence to draw definite conclusions concerning the origin of faa. As is,
however, documented for other languages too, the element might be related to
the 3-4 person singular pronoun far (see e.g. Heine & Reh 1984:280). There
doesn’t seem to be any evidence for this type of construction in Old Nobiin. This
might explain why only very few instances can be found in the known texts. An
equivalent can presumably be found in those relative clauses introduced by de-
monstrative pronoun in.
    Lepsius (ibid.) describes another construction as equivalent of a relative
clause. This is introduced by an interrogative pronoun and interpreted by him as
an indirect question. His examples are from the translation of the gospel:
214
      (GM 14.44)
      nai-gaa_  ai     fa-daawoos-ii__tal-lin    takkaa kogorakir dumm-anaa
      who-OB) I        IFUT-kiss-ISG    he-cop   him _ hold       take-IMPERPL
      “whom I will kiss, he is the one; seize him’
     (GM 4.9)
     nai_sukki-g_      kun-ii           ukkee-nan-gaa__ukki-eion
     who ear-OB)       have-PARTPRES    hear-INF-OBJ    —_—hear-3SGJUSS
     “he who has ears to hear, let him hear’    Although interrogative pronoun yai- is documented in Old Nobiin only a few
    examples are found in the texts. None                   of the contexts can be interpreted as
    equivalent of a relative clause.
       Summing up the different constructions of relative clauses in Modern Nobiin
    presented above, the following overview can be put together:
            . indicative + noun-OBJ + indicative (+ modifier [+ postposition])
NDnkwnd —
            . indicative + noun-(OBJ) + participle-(OBJ) (+ modifier [+ postposition])
            . noun + noun-OBjJ + participle + indicative
            - noun(-OBJ) + noun-GEN + participle + indicative
            . (noun) + noun-OBJ + indicative + taa (+ noun) + indicative
            . nai(-OBJ) + different types of clauses                  °
 The overview is far from being exhaustive. A systematic study of Nobiin syntax
 will presumably uncover additional types and enable more systematic categoriza-
 tion. It can, however, be concluded that the type most frequently used employs
 the participle in the relative clause. These types more or less correspond to the
 construction in Old Nobiin presented above. Juxtaposition of two indicatives is
 also documented rather frequently and presumably corresponds to a construction
 with subjunctive in the relative clause in Old Nobiin. The types with introducing
 pronouns are rarely used and are not present in Old Nobiin.","[210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215]"

should be noted that the verbs which take the purposive suffix are not marked for
tense/aspect.
    Another formation of purpose clauses is also based on the endings of the con-
ditional (see chapter 7) to which once more the complementizer -a is added. As
is the case for the conditional a complete paradigm can be put together for the
purposive consisting of
 IsG                     -koioa
2/38G.                   -konnoa
 1/2PL                   -kouoa
3PL                      -koannoa (-kuannoa)One example from the Miracle of St. Menas is:
(M. 9. 5-8)

‘and the father said to the boy: “O in truth, cooking bring it to me, in order that I may eat”The example shows that the construction could be used, if the subject of the
purpose clause was not identical to the subject of the main clause. As for the
conditional, there is also a variant with -ka which is documented in one of the
Qasr Ibrim texts:
(IT III 30.26-27)
epimaxosi_sippi-n            aueir      kemso-ka   ni-kr-a             an    oi-n         tri    tauo

 194
 Corresponding to the conditional, a form -koa(lo)                      in which the person      is not
 marked is also documented.
      Finally, in a third construction the imperative in connection with the verb il-
 ‘to say’ and complementizer -a can serve to express a purpose clause (see also
 Excurse 2 where additional examples are given), as in:
 (Lec. 112.10)
 ted-in       tauo   da-l-gu-ka         janos-ij-e-s-a
 they-GEN     under be-PART-PL-OBJ      redcem-PL-IMPER-EMPH-COMP
 ‘in order that he might redeem those who are under the law’ Looking at Modern Nobiin, the question arises what happened to these different
 formations of purposes clauses. Although the conditional construction based on
 -ka has been preserved the conditional-based paradigm for the purposive pre-
 sented above seems to have completely disappeared. Corresponding to Old No-
 biin is a formation with an element -eenii which still has the variants -oonii and
-aani. Contrary, however, to the construction in Old Nobiin, the suffix is attached
to the tense/aspect/person marker of the verb, as in the following examples from
the Ermenne narrative and the Gospel of St. Mark:
(Erm. 103)
ai    fa-kir-a          ikka         irii   _firge-k-ka           fa-aaw-a-tee-r-een
|     IFUT-come-ADJ     you-OBJ      you    wish-PARTPRES-OBJ     IFUT-d0-ADJ-BEN-1SGPRES-PURP
‘I will come, in order that I do for you what you want’In this example, the suffixing of the purpose marker to the tense/aspect/person
suffix is one indicator for a construction which basically differs from the one in
Old Nobiin. Main clause and purpose clause are related as a verbal complex with
the main verb marked as adjunctive and only the verb in the purpose clause tak-
ing the tense/aspect/person suffix. The purpose clause includes a pronominal
object and an additional object clause consisting of the present participle with the
suffix -ka.
    This construction can also be used if the subjects of main and purpose clause
differ, as in
(GM   1,17)
abaag annaa kaj-j-an                   ai   fa    ukkaa         ademi-ri-in

‘follow me so that | will make you fishers of men’
                                                                                                   195
Because of the different subjects, the two verbs cannot be constructed as verbal
complex but have to take separate tense/aspect/number markers.
   In the last example, we also find separate markers in the clauses presumably
due to the imperative in the main clause:
(GM 6,31)
tann-ana-ion               falee    wee-lakidekka_tiig-all-ooni
gO-IMPERPL-he said         desert   one-toalittle     sit-FUT-PURP
“go”, he said, “to a desert in order to stay a little”In all three examples, the verb is marked as future/intentional, the old as well as
the innovated formation are used. In the last sentence from the gospel, the imper-
sonal purpose clause has the future infinitive and is not marked for person.
    Werner (1987:166ff.) seems to be confused with regard to the correct segmen-
tation of the suffixes when he categorizes the purposive (“Begriindungs- oder
Finalform”) as present tense paradigm. He presents the following ending:
IsG                 -leeni/-reeni                          IPL              -looni/-rooni
2sG                 -nameeni                              2PL               -lokomeetii
3sG                 -naani                                3PL               -innanaaniThese actually are the present tense suffixes to which the endings discussed
above were added. As Werner has no examples in his sentences but only the
paradigm he collected, it can only be assumed that in a context, the innovated
future prefix would have been required.
   In most instances, an additional purpose marker ken ‘in order to, so that’ is
found which either introduces the purpose clause or is prefixed to the verb, as in
(GM    11,25)
ken             uffab           semaa-la_    semb       unni-ga    fa-saamahi-n-aani

(GM 15,32)

we-and see-ADJ inorderto            believe-OFUT-1 PLPRESPURP
‘so that we may see and believe’The origin of this element is obscure because it is not found in Old Nobiin. The
habitual marker -ken- which is suffixed to the verb is an unlikely candidate for a
 196
 prefixed purposive marker. The verb kan-/ken-/kin- ‘to be, become’ is not docu-
 mented in contexts which indicates the beginning of a development towards a
 purposive marker. The same applies for the verb ken- ‘to place’ which is docu-
 mented as first verb in verbal complexes in Old Nobiin. To interpret some of
 these constructions as purpose clauses would be more fantasy than plausibility.
 Thus, it has to be concluded that the origin of -ken- remains a mystery and that
Old Nobiin gives no hint towards its unraveling. This is all the more unfortunate
as in the modern language, ken can replace all other markers of a purpose clause
and serve as the only indicator for this type of a clause. Examples are:
(Erm. 61)
iboo-n-deni              ikka          gelaabiye uwoo-ga         jan-a         semmi-logo arrauwi-j-a

“for your father’s wife has bought two dresses for you, spread poison on them and deposited them for
you in order to kill you’This type of construction also has the infinitive marked as future/intentional. In
the translation of the gospel, we find another construction consisting of ken +
future/intentional infinitive and suffix -ea which, as has been described before,
consists of infinitive -e and reduced -a (see Excurse 2). An example is:
(GM 16.1)
jaan-isan      gatti-gaa = takkaa_        ken              kusm-all-eaa
buy-3PLPRET    spices-OB)  him            inorderto        anoint-OFUT-PURP
‘they bought spices in order to anoint him’With the exception of innovated ken, this formation most probably goes back
the third construction of Old Nobiin described above consisting of the imperativ
in connection with the verb i/- ‘to say’ and complementizer -a.","[193, 194, 195, 196, 197]"

         A double relative marked as object is found in the following example from a
     sales contract:
     (IT III 40, 14-15)
     parre     kapop-in           jan-a          dis-sil              ir-aula        pi-l

     udji-ltauo       —_pi-k-ka
     Udji-below       lie-PARTPRES-OBJ     “(I) sold Kapopi’s land which is within my power and which lies in Lower Udji’     As referent, the demonstrative pronoun in ‘this’ can be added which results in a
     kind of subtype of type 3 above:
    4. noun + demonstrative + participle/subjunctive
       salu.  in pes-in
           word    this say-3SGPRESSUB
           ‘the word which he says’ = lit.: ‘the word this he says”    As the demonstrative pronouns generally precede their noun in- seems to actu-
    ally function as a relative pronoun in these constructions. The following example
    is from a documentary text from Qasr Ibrim:
—   (IT IIL 33, 8-9)
    in        doll-en-gul-lo               dui-I-la
    this      wish-PRESPART-PL-EMPH_       be-PART-from
    ‘he is amongst those who wish’    According to Browne (2002:84), a relative clause introduced by in- is either
    individually definite or typically general. The example above belongs to the
    latter category. The literal meaning is ‘being from those wishing’. The pronomi-
    nal referent is understood, but not expressed.
        In all types described above, we find either the participle or the subjunctive in
    the relative clause. There are, however, additional constructions which employ
    the predicative or even the indicative in the relative clause. This becomes neces-
    sary if the referent is also marked as predicative. The following variants can be
    distinguished:
    5. noun-PRED + (noun-OB)) + predicative
           cit-a       sak-ka    _—pes-ra
           man-PRED word-OB) say-PRED
           “the man, who says the word’ = lit.: ‘(it) is the man says the word’    6. noun-PRED + noun-SUBJ + predicative
       sal-a       it-il     pes-ra
         word-PRED     man-SUB) say-PRED
         “the word, which the man says’ = lit.: ‘(it) is the word the man says’                                                                                                       209
7.   noun+PRED + indicative
     sal-a         pes-na
     word-PRED     say-3SGPRESIND
     “the word which he says’ = lit.: ‘(it) is the word he says’The first example comes from the ‘Miracle of St. Menas’ and shall be explained
in detail because it shows that the structure of sentences in the texts is actually
more complex than the formalized sentences show:
(M. 1.1-3)
nokkor-a          Xristosi-in    martyrosu     nissu mina-na       au-sa-lo
miracle-PRED      Christ-GEN     martyr        holy Mena-GEN       do-PREDPRETII-COP
‘it is a miracle which Mena, the holy martyr of Christ, did’The first part of the example above consists of a nominal sentence marked by
predicative -a. Browne (1997, and others) interprets final -/o as the postposition
functioning as a copula. As suffix -a is sufficient to mark a predicate, -/o can also
be interpreted as emphatic particle or focus marker. au-sa- is a predicative the
ending of which goes back to a preterit II participle -si/- plus predicative -a-. The
verb in the modifying clause is nominalized, and because of this its subject mina-
na is marked for genitive case. The sentence is an example of a restrictive rela-
tive clause where the relative or modifying clause restricts the referent, in this
 case the ‘miracle’, to a specific member of that class, in this case ‘which Mena
 did’. Browne (1994:22) classifies this type of construction as “attributive relative
 clause”. The literal meaning of the sentence is ‘(it) is a miracle the holy martyr of
 Christ Mena’s having done’.
      A noun connected with miffan ‘any, all’ has to take predicative -a. Accord-
 ingly, this also applies for relative clauses with mifJan as the following example
 from sales contract shows:
  IT III 36 i 15-16)
  varre in      sigerrin-na_—s   da-ra       miffan-ka   jan-a     te-ra
 land this document-in           be-PRED      all-OBJ    trade-ADJ give-PREDPRES
 ‘I sell all land which is in this document’ The relative clause is embedded between the referent and its modifier which is
 marked as object. In the main clause, the predicative is used because the subject
 is known and therefore mustn’t be marked at the main verb.
    A similar but slightly different construction is found in the next example from
 the miracle of Menas.","[208, 209, 210]"
"
 Posteriority Temporal clauses of this type often show the postposition -pau(u) ‘when, until’
 as subordinating conjunction or complementizer. In these contexts, -pau(u) ex-
 presses the end of a period of time, as in
 (IT 11 58, 11)
 ai-de urti-ka           den-e[n]                 pau         ak-ire
 I-and   property-OB)    give me-3SGPRESSUB_          until   stay-1SGPRES ‘I am staying until he gives me the property’
202
 The subjunctive seems to be regularly used, if the subject of the main clause
 differs from that of the subordinate clause. If the two are identical, the participle
 can be employed.
      Although the subjunctive is expected in the subordinate clause the indicative
 is found in the next sentence. There are several other examples for the use of the
 indicative in complement/subordinate clauses in the documentary texts which
 could indicate the beginning of the loss of subjunctive forms.
 (IT IIL 55 ii 3-4)

 Come-ISGPRESIND until        my — all-oB)         grect-IMPERSG
 ‘until | come greet all my (people)’ ~pau- can also be followed by object marker -ga, as in
 (M. 7.9-15)
 agopp-il-lon          kumpu-ka dumm-et-a              as-in       tu-la__  ken-a

 food       _other-in set-3SGPRETIIIND   Philoxenite-to come-PRESPART       until ‘and the skipper taking (and) receiving the egg, placing (it) within the hold, set (it) amongst the other
 food, until he came to Philoxenite’As the subject of the main clause is the same as that of the subordinate clause,
the participle is used with -pauka. The use of the object marker suggests that
-pau is a noun by origin. There is only one possible candidate in the Old Nobiin
dictionary pau(u) ‘power, authority, order’. The object marker -ka is often used
in temporal expressions to denote duration (see chapter 3.2.3).
     A remnant        of this construction          seems       to be preserved         in what   Werner
(1987:191 ff.) calls the subjunctive with -/aan ‘until’. Although initial -- in Mod-
em Nobiin regularly corresponds to Old Nobiin -p-, final -n is not easy to ex-
plain. The forms are discussed in Excurse 1.
    Abel (1913) as well as Lepsius (1880) have the temporal postposition -famini
‘until’ in the position of -faan. Zyhlarz (1928:95) cites an unfortunately damaged
Old Nobiin graffito where he reads pami ‘until’ which could be related to
-famini. As subordinating conjunction, -famini follows the infinitive, as the ex-
amples from the Ermenne narrative and the gospel according to Mark show:
(Erm. 39)
wilit-ta_    inp-adaag-roi         geraia-Itoni   kir-o-famin
boy-OBJ      await-DUR-IPLJUSS     school-from come-INFPRET-until‘let us sit and wait for the boy until he comes from school’
                                                                                                     203
(GM 6.10)
sirr    agar-raa    urin   juu-e           noogid-do    taddo _ tiig-an          uriin juu-e-faaminii
where    place-at   your    go-INFPRES     house-into   thereat   stay-IMPERPL   your   go-INFPRES-until“wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave’The two examples show that the infinitive is employed whether or not the sub-
jects of the clauses are identical. If the subject is expressed as in the second in-
stance, it is in the genitive in accordance with the nominal character of the verb
 in the subordinate clause.
    Only Reinisch (1879:39ff.) gives -faan as well as -famini as Nobiin forms in
 his dictionary. This could indicate a dialectal variation within the language.
 There and in his grammar (1879:148), he cites an additional variant -duofamini/
 -duefamini also mentioned by Lepsius (1880:289) who adds variant -duuwe-
Jfaminii). An example from Lepsius’ gospel is
(GM 9.9)
tariin fas-siin-keela              duuwefaaminii    diio-kuu-ltooni
his    _rise-PARTPRETII-after      until            dead-PL-from
‘until after he rose from the dead’The literal meaning is ‘until after his having risen from the dead’. Lepsius inter-
prets the first part as the independent verb duu- ‘come, reach, arrive, happen’
which is most probably related to Old Nobiin dul- ‘be (located), exist, remain,
continue’ used in periphrastic constructions after the participle or predicative. A
construction like the one above is reminiscent of the periphrastics of Old Nobiin
and could be regarded as evidence for their partial preservation in some fossilized
contexts.","[202, 203, 204]"

     The impersonal as well as personal forms of the relative seem to be neutral
  with regard to tense/aspect. The following three examples from the Menas leg-
  end show different tense/aspect markers in the consequent.
  (M. 4.13-15)
  itt-il-lon             pes-sna                    alesin in-no    tukr-en    is-gil            jo-din
  woman-SUBJ-and         say-3SGPRETIIIND           truly this-from leave-COND where-to          go-2SGOFUTSUB
  ‘and the woman said: “truly, if you depart from here to where will you go” The consequent is marked as future/intentional and action expressed in the ante-
 cendent can be understood as taking place either in the present or future. In the
 main clause, the indicative would have been expected.
 (M. 4.16-5.4)
 agopp-il           pes-ara               alesin     od-il         ai-ka   = mudu-konno

 Philoxenite-to-EMPH        go-ISGPRESIND ‘the skipper said: “truly, if god guides me, I go to Philoxenite”’ The consequent is marked as present and therefore, the antecedent is understood
 as taking place at the same time.
 (M. 6.10)
 alesin unn-re                          en-en-non            Xristianos-a-n-adimme

 ‘And truly, if 1 do give birth, | shall become Christian’In choosing an indicative periphrastic construction for the conditional antece-
dent, an additional tense/aspect marking was made possible. The indicative is
marked as present, the conditional has no marker for tense/aspect, and the conse-
quent has the suffixes of the future affirmative.
   The combination of conditional + imperative is also documented in the docu-
mentary texts where the modern forms of the conditional with -ka- seem to be
preferred:
(IT Il 51, 6-8)
el-ok          kotin tanni-ka__       tik-kauan-de              pal-a        jur-eeso

                                                                                                                 189
Although Moder Nobiin alleeg ‘truly’ is documented as correspondence to Old
Nobiin alesin it is not used in conditional clauses.                                              Instead an optional parti-
cle/conjunction, -on/-lon is employed which is suffixed to the subject of the
protasis, as in
(Erm. 5)
wide      nor-oni    gemiil-tan-go             timm-oo-ko-kani                            [...J

‘and if god fulfils his goodness [...]’Most certainly, modern -on/-/on originates in Old Nobiin -on (-/lon after -/-) ‘and,
but’. There are contexts in Old Nobiin texts in which -on is used to introduce a
conditional or temporal consequent, as in
(M. 3. 1-9)

in function has taken place, from introducing an apodosis to introducing the
conditional protasis. According to Abel (1913:21), ten out of twenty-one relative
clauses have -on/-lon most of which are attached to a personal pronoun.
       As for the sequence of tenses in ‘open’ conditional clauses, the texts present
the following combinations:
                              Antecedent                                          Consequent
                1.            present conditional                                 future/intentional, e. g.
(Erm. 19)
ai      ed-oo-kaie                            ikka     in-ideni             fa-kuud-an-o-tee-n

    190
             2.           present conditional                        imperative, e. g.
(GM 13.29)

recognize-IMPERPL         be near-COMP     door-GEN      front-at‘if you see in this way if it comes recognize that he is near in front of the door’It is interesting to note that the subject of the second conditional is marked as
genitive. Similar constructions have been observed by Abel (193 1:27ff.). In these
instances, the verb seems to be interpreted as a nominalized verbal form.
   An exception to the otherwise more or less strict sequence of tenses/aspects in
conditionals is found in the next example from the Ermenne narrative:
(Erm. 75)
aawo-tik-kaye               ken           diioos-eye           ebeden-ogo       aag-a-timmu-mun
do-BEN-ISGCONDPRES          in order that die-[she said]       never-in         HAB-ADJ-accomplish-3SGNEGPRES
‘if I do (sth.) so that he dies it is never accomplished‘The use of the present in the consequent is probably linked to the use of the ha-
bitual. Although the habitual is not expressed in the antecedent it is understood,
and the implicit meaning is ‘every time I do something so that he dies...’.
    Examples for remote or counterfactual conditionals are rare in the texts. As
has been mentioned before these constructions serve as irrealis in Old Nobiin.
Marker of the irrrealis is the suffix -en the origin of which is far from clear. I*
might be related to in- ‘to be’, the most convincing explanation so far.

“for if they had known, they would not have hanged upon the cross the Lord of Glory’It is interesting to note that irrealis marker -en follows the tense/aspect/person
suffix in the example above. In the consequent, the verb is marked as future
preterit.
    Browne (2002:89) compares -en to a form described as ‘electivum’ by Lepsius
(1880:113-114). According to Lepsius, this suffix is used in the preterit and
conveys the meaning of ‘I could have done it (if I had wanted to)’ which seems
to imply an irrealis. One example from the gospel is
                                                                                                           191

‘for this perfume might have been sold for over three hundred denarii, and the money given to the

him by his informants, there is unfortunately only this singular example for this
type of construction in the texts. Contrary to the order of elements in Oid Nobiin,
-een here precedes the tense/aspect/person markers in Modern Nobiin.
    There is one additional example for an irrealis construction in Old Nobiin
which seems to be a predicative periphrastic:
(IT 1412-3)
iri _ inno du-ar-en-kan                      an ennal   di-men-dra-lo

‘if you had been here, my brother would not have died’In the consequent, the future is used which conveys the literal meaning of ‘will
not die’.
    In addition to Lepsius’ ‘electivum’ as a corresponding way of expressing an
irrealis in Modern Nobiin, it is expressed by the endings of the conditional fol-
 lowing the perfect marker in the protasis. In the apodosis, the innovated future is
 followed by the suffixes of the preterit resulting in a future preterit, as in

subject of the clause is identical to the subject of the main clause the element
-inia or one of its variants -ania/-enua/-inua/-unua is suffixed to the verb.'* The '8 Browne (2002:90ff.) calls this construction “non-personal final clause”.","[188, 189, 190, 191, 192]"
"13.12 Letter-writing The documents most difficult to understand and interpret are the letters from
 Qasr Ibrim. This is partly due to their fragmentary condition, partly due to the
 informal character of the language used which often seems to reflect spoken
 language. This is exciting for a linguist who gets a glimpse of a linguistic varia-
tion which otherwise mostly remains unknown but frustrating for anyone con-
centrating on content. Because only one side of the correspondence is preserved,
understanding is additionally impeded. More often than not the question arises
what the writer wanted to communicate to the addressee.
    The letters fall into different categories, depending on their being more or less
official in character. The most difficult to understand is the personal correspon-
dence. Rather official are the letter to and from the eparchs which often refer to
disbursement of grain. Grain seems to have been stored either in central storage
facilities or in places belonging to the eparch.”¢ In spite of the official character
of these letters, they also show a personal touch which breathes life into the me-
dieval texts. Even though problems with economical transactions are addressed,
personal remarks reveal actual human beings speaking to us. “Come, in order
that I may show you affection. What is it? The king has ordered you. Why are
you reluctant to approach the task?”, an unidentified eparch writes to a man
called Maffuda. Another letter seems to have been dictated or written by a possi-
bly angry Eparch Adam (IT III 51). It reads unintentionally comical when Adam
writes: “Being reluctant to give (them) to her (agent) who was about to come, I
took the dates and gulped them down.”
    Amongst the letters preserved we also find documents originating from the
ecclesiastical administration as well as priestly correspondence. Concerning the
latter, Adams (1996:229) wonders about the reason why they were actually ar-
chived because “they do not appear to deal with matters of great consequence”.
This, however, we are not in the position to decide in retrospective. And if we
look at modern administrative practices of preserving every snippet of paper at
least for a certain period of time there is no reason to assume that the medieval23 The Arabic documents from Qasr Ibrim edited by Hinds and Sakkout in 1986 come from the
   Ottoman period.

 suffix consists of -ini already known from conditional clauses and -a which is
 either the predicative or more probably the complementizer -a also used in vari-
 ous other constructions and described in Excurse 2. The literal meaning of pur-
 Pose clauses constructed in this way would be ‘saying, if...’. The variations are
 presumably due to assimilation processes depending on the vocalization of the
 preceding verb. The following examples are from the Miracle of St. Menas:
(M. 9.16-10.1)

sacrament-OBJ take-in order to‘and, since it was Sunday, the skipper, ascending, went to the village, in order to receive the sacra-

setting of the scene and is marked as subjunctive. The main clause consists of a
verbal complex ked-a ki-sna ‘he ascends comes’ marked as 3"" person singular
preterit II indicative and is followed by the purpose clause.

‘and that woman, bringing (and) taking the egg, descending, went to the water, with a servant girl, in

sukk-a ki-sna ‘she brings, takes, descends, comes’. en-et are juxtaposed and seem
to represent a new semantic unit. This unit and the next verb respectively are
marked as adjunctives and the complex closes with a regular preterit II indica-
tive. The purpose clause contains a second verbal complex consisting of e/-a
it-enia ‘in order to find, take’.
   The final example from St. Menas is introduced by a temporal clause marked
by -/okono ‘after’ which follows the preterit II participle (see below). The main
clause has the suffixes of the preterit II indicative and is followed by the purpose
clause.","[192, 193]"

other part of the sentence which needn’t to be overtly expressed. -/- refers to a
plural object and occasionally to a plural subject. It can also function as an inten-
sifier or denote plurality of action. This variety of functions is found in theologi-
cal and formal as well as in the documentary texts.

Modern Nobiin. According to Werner (1987:173),                                     it is neutral as to tone. He
restricts the element              to a marker             of plurality          of objects—as       did   Lepsius
(1880:127ff.)}—and secondary to plurality of action. His out-of-context example

 2.5.1 The Texts This study is based on Old and Modem Nobiin texts published by various au-
 thors. As the corpus of Old Nobiin is restricted, all texts were included except
 small fragments and texts where only smaller parts were well preserved. Old
 Nobiin textual material extends over a period of seven hundred years. Most of
 the texts cannot be dated accurately; paleographic studies which aim at a chrono-
  logical classification of the material are still missing. There is some evidence that
  most of the documents originate in the tenth to twelfth centuries. The oldest
  manuscript preserved so far dates back to 797 (Lajtar 1997:117); the youngest
  one bears the date 1484 (Adams 1977:533). Half of the documents preserved
  cover religious texts, as e. g. translations of the New and Old Testament, homilies
  and other Christian writings. The other half comprises documentary texts such as
  contracts and letters. In the latter category are 32 manuscripts which were found
  in one vessel at Qasr Ibrim and could be identified as part of 12th century archive
  on the basis of date specifications at the beginning of the texts. Most of the
  documents originate in Lower Nubia where Nobiin is still spoken today. This has
 nothing to do with a geographically uneven distribution of writing in Nubia, but
 with the northern part being much better excavated than the south.
     The two main textual categories differ in several ways. The religious texts are
 often works of translation from Greek Vorlagen and because of the specific con-
 text represent a rather conservative Nobiin. By far the longest religious text is the
 24
so-called Serra East codex which was published by Browne under the name of its
Greek Vorlage Ps. Chrisostom. /n venerabilem crucem sermo (Browne 1984).
The documentary texts, and within this groups one has to mention specifically
the letters, show a more modern language which sometimes even gives the im-
pression of a “spoken” variety. Many concern economic transactions including
sales of land and orders for payment. We find documentation of emancipation of
slaves and the personal correspondence between dignitaries of the Nubian
church.!°
    The entire corpus of Old Nobiin has the size of about one hundred pages of
continuous text.'!' The problems brought about by a corpus which is limited in
content and form are understood but not further discussed here. Nevertheless, it
is more than adequate to serve as the basis for a historical grammar. Hopefully,
more textual material will be found in the future which will allow us to complete
our knowledge of the language. For a survey of the textual editions, I refer to the
list of abbreviations and the bibliography.
    The documents mentioned above were used in their published and annotated
form. 1 mainly worked with the numerous publications by the late Gerald M.
Browne whom we owe most of the first or revised editions of the Old Nobiin
texts. His “Old Nubian dictionary” (1996) and his very compact “Old Nubian
grammar” (2002) have been extremely helpful for me. Griffith’s first editions of
different Old Nobiin texts (1913) and the first comprehensive grammar by Zyh-
larz (1928) were also consulted.
    Because Nobiin definitely ceased to function as written language by the end
of the 15th century we have a large gap in our direct knowledge of the processes
of language change which extends over a period of four hundred years. A few
words and phrases were recorded by the Franciscan Arcangelo Carradori in 1635
in Egypt; the material is interesting but restricted and doesn’t help to reconstruct
language change.
   The modern written documentation of Nobiin starts with the European schol-
ars Leo Reinisch and Richard Lepsius in 1879 and 1880. The latter undertook his
field research   in Nubia    in the   1840s, so that what we call Modern       Nubian    starts
in the middle of the nineteenth century. This classification is arbitrary because it
depends on the presence of linguists in Egypt and the Sudan and not on linguistic
criteria. The longest text published by Lepsius is a translation of the gospel ac-
cording to Mark from Arabic into Nobiin. This he complemented by several
Nobiin songs he recorded when he traveled in the region. In the foreword to his

13.5 King and EparchThe Nubian kingdom was headed by the king, called uru in Old Nobiin. In the
Qasr Ibrim texts, the Greek title basileos is sometimes used and Arabic sources
speak of the “King of Makuria/Nubia” or of the “Great King” or, in a few sour-
ces, of the Kamil or Kabil, unrecorded in documents from Nubia itself. The
sources from Nubia do not reveal much information about the actual status, func-
tion and life of the king. He is mentioned in the introduction of sales contracts
and other official documents right after the Holy Trinity but as this part of the
texts is highly formulaic, this doesn’t help to bring light to this high office. An-
other presumed formula in a release of a slave (IT III 33) evokes the king’s
deadly curse against any person to act contrary to the release. A similar evocation
is found at the end of the only royal proclamation preserved in Old Nobiin
(ITIII 30). The king at the time of the proclamation (about           1155) was Moses
George who according to the texts also held the office of the Eparch of Palagi
(see below). His authority allowed him to free from servitude the Epimachus-
Church of Ibrim-West which obviously was bound to deliver wine or worm-
wood. There isn’t much more to be learned from the Nubian sources. This might
at least partially be due to the scarce written evidence from the royal residence at
Dongola. Non-Nubian sources on the other hand give information about the
Nubian     king which   seems   to be unsubstantiated. Abu     Salih the Armenian,    for
example, who wrote before 1200 AD and often—if not always—copied older
sources describes a Nubian priest king celebrating the liturgy within the sanctu-
ary. He repeats the same when writing about the Abyssinian kings and apparently
only reports what he heard about some unidentified southern kings (Vantini
1975:332, 339).
      As part of the historical construct of the unification of the two Nubian king-
doms, the office of the viceroy of the formerly independent kingdom of Nobatia
was “invented” (e. g. Adams 1977:464) and identified as the ‘Eparch of Nobadia’
documented in different sources. The Qasr Ibrim texts reveal that this interpreta-
tion is not based on the written sources but simply on the assumption that a for-
mer allegedly independent kingdom must at least have insisted on a viceroy as
second in command. As Adams later (1996) pointed out, the Eparch’s function
may have been overrated in the literature because according to the dominating
discourse on medieval Nubia, a viceroy had to be fitted in.
      In the context of lists containing titles of officials preserved in Qasr Ibrim, the
Eparch is only one amongst many and not set apart from the others. Adams tries
to explain the relationship between the Eparch of Nobatia and the king of Do-
tawo in the following way: “The best suggestion is probably that the king and the230
eparch held dominion over clearly distinct spheres of activity, the king being the
main source of civil and legal authority while the eparch was responsible for
trade and for relations with Muslims in general.” Taking a closer look at the lists,
it becomes evident that king and eparch are far from being on the same hierar-
chical level. The most detailed ones consist of two parts. The first part is headed
by the king of Dotawo, the king’s mother and some high officials close to the
 king. The second part begins with the words “and in Nobadia [...]” followed by
 the title and name of the Eparch and other dignitaries belonging to the region
 (Browne 1991). One sales contract explicitly describes the position of the Ep-
 arch: “[...] and in Nobadia all authority being attached to him“ (ibid., 42). In this
 context, Nobatia turns out to be subordinate to Dotawo rather than existing side
 by side.
     The texts furthermore reveal that more than one eparch was operating in Nu-
 bia. Other officials with this title are associated with Lower Nubia and Palagi. In
 a royal proclamation (IT III 30), king Moses George of Dotawo also held the
office of the Eparch of Palagi. The existence of several eparchal offices also
contradicts the notion of some kind of “deal” which was negotiated at the alleged
 unification of the Nubian kingdoms.
     Again, it seems interesting to look at what the different sources tell about the
eparch and his function. Starting with the title itself, the Greek eparchos is found
in some of the Old Nobiin sources, but much more often the Nobiin equivalent
soyoj is found. Both designations do not appear in Arabic documents. Instead,
the title “Lord of the Mountain” or “Lord of the Horses”, with both readings
possible in unpointed texts, are found. As the reading “Lord of the Mountain” is
supported by some pointed Arabic texts, Browne (e. g. 1991:xi) interpreted the
Nobiin title as consisting of yoj(j) ‘mountain’ and archaic or dialectal variant of
sa(e)- ‘governor’. This etymology is, however, far from being convincing. Sa(e)-
seems to be only documented once (ChN 4.8) and then in a context where it
refers to the captain of a ship. Furthermore, we would expect a different order of
the parts of the compound, because in Nobiin, the genitive usually precedes its
noun. It seems just as possible that the second element is related to Old Nobiin
yod- ‘Lord’.
   Adams (1996:245) reports that among the Qasr Ibrim texts, some letters writ-
ten in pointed Arabic and addressed to the Eparch were found in which the read-
ing “Lord of the Horses” or even “Lord of the King’s Horses” is equally undis-
putable. This matches the late Gerald Browne’s find that the Arabic “Lord of the
Horses” is a direct rendering of Old Nobiin mourt-in nod-il ‘horse-GEN lord-
SUBJ’ which is documented in a text (cited as pers. comm. in Adams 1996:245).
   We can conclude that in the case of the office of eparch, the Arab sources cor-
rectly translate at least one of his titles. Whether Nobiin soyoj corresponds to                                                                                  231
Arabic “Lord of the Mountain” remains dubious, as does the connection between
the two titles and the functions of the soyoj. In a letter of Eparch Masi (IT II 24),
the author writes that he was out in charge of the horses of his addressee. This
might indicate that the eparch was responsible for the welfare of horses but he
could just as well have been talking about a personal arrangement.
   In the Old Nobiin texts from Qasr Ibrim, the eparch presents himself primarily
through his correspondence. One of his duties was the disbursement of grain
mentioned in most of the eparchal letters in Old Nobiin. More information on the
functions of the eparch is found in the Arabic manuscripts which, unfortunately,
are not published yet. Preliminary reports about the content of some of these
manuscripts show that the eparch organized the trade with Muslim Egypt and
had also some diplomatic responsibilities (Plumley 1975:106). This for once
corresponds to what Arab sources tell about the eparch. His office looms large in
these texts which is not surprising given that he presumably was the most impor-
tant official the Muslim traders had to deal with. Detailed information on the
“Lord of the Mountain” is found in al-Magrizis renarration of al-Aswani’s ac-
count (Vantini 1975:602ff.). He is described as representative of the Nubian king
and any Moslem who wanted to trade in Nubia had to deal with him. According
to al-Aswani/al-Maqrizi, one of his responsibilities is to prevent any trader or
traveler to proceed further upstream to Dongola without a travel permit. As the
‘Lord of the Mountain’ was responsible for the relationship with Egyptian Mus-
lims, he might also have been the official to take care of the bagt-treaty which
regulated the provision of slaves to Egypt in exchange for manufactured goods
and which also guaranteed freedom to travel and settle in northern Nubia to Mus-
lims from Egypt and elsewhere. This, however, can only be indirectly deduced
and is not actually documented in the written sources (comp. Adams
1996:245ff.).
   For the obvious reasons indicated above the Arab sources seem to be only in-
terested in the Eparch of Nobadia. But even the sources from Nubia itself do not
reveal how, aside from dealing with the Moslem north, his duties differ from
those of the eparchs of Lower Nobadia and Palagi. One order from Tamsi, Ep-
arch of Lower Nobadia (IT III 46), also concerns the disposal of grain. It would,
however, over-interpret the scant evidence to assume that the office of the eparch
was always connected with central grain storing facilities.","[229, 230, 231, 232]"
"6.3 Old Future/Intentional/IrrealisZyhlarz was the first to describe in detail what he called the Old Nubian Future
Tense. His presentation showed some discrepancies and was in need of clarifica-
tion. This clarification came from Hintze (1977) who tried to organize the differ-
ent endings of the future and to make a new attempt at interpreting the alternative
forms. He, however, kept Zyhlarz’ original classification into future I and fu-
ture II which he arranged into three levels respectively, the meaning of which he
was unable to determine on the basis of the data at his disposal. He assumed that
the different levels express different aspects or Aktionsarten.
   Browne (1982:12) objected to Hintze’s complicated classification and ex-
plained that the two suffixes of the future, -d- and -ad-/-ar, which are present in
Old Nobiin, are allomorphs rather than two different types of future. The form
with -d- follows vowels, n-, /- or r-, -ad-/-ar follow a consonant or double nn-, /l-
or rr-. The suffixes of the so-called future tense consist of the allomorphic future
 participles -aril-/-dil, -del + personal endings. The paradigms are the following:
                    Indicative      Subjunctive                 Indicative    | Subjunctive
 IsG                -arre           -arri                       -dire           -di/eri
2SG                 -anna           -an                         -di/ena         -di/en
3sG                 -anna           -an                         -di/ena         -di/en
 IPL                -arro           -arrou                      -diro           -di/erou
2PL                 -arro           -arrou                      -diro           -di/erou
3PL                 -arrana         -arran                      -dirana         -di/eran This form which has traditionally been called future tense by the different au-
 thors actually fulfils a variety of functions, as can be shown with examples from
 different texts.
     Temporal expressions with future meaning are uncommon in Old Nobiin
 texts. Sometimes, however, e//e ‘time’ is used which in these cases seems to
 function as an adverb with meaning ‘in the future’ (Browne 2002:77):
 (ChN 5.16-17)
 in   elle           eli         u-k          uskr-a      tij-j-arri-ka
 this (inthe future) today       you-PL-OBJ   place-ADJ   OBJ-PLOBJ-1SGOFUTSUB-OB)
 ‘that which I shall set before you today’ 84
With eli ‘today’ we have another temporal adverb which marks the period of
time at which the event is going to happen. The event is going to happen on the
same day but sometimes later. The point of reference here is the moment of
speaking.
   Corresponding to the religious content of many of the texts the so-called fu-
ture is often present in prophecies or annunciations. The first example belongs to
the gospel according to St. Matthew where an angel appears to Joseph in a dream
and announces the birth of Jesus:
(Lect. 100.3-4)
tan tanis-ka    =emmannucla          ok-arrana
his name-OB) Immanuel                call-3PLOFUTIND
‘[and when she bears a son] they shall call his name Immanuel’Although not exactly prophetic, the next example from a personal letter contain-
ing an order for payment is predictive in that it foretells what will happen to the
addressee:
(IT 111 47, 7-8)
micl         ir-ia          pad-dina-lo
fault(?)     you-in         come forth-3SGOFUTIND-EMPH
‘The fault (?) in you will come forth’As in many languages of the world the old future of Nobiin is often found in
contexts where intention is expressed which leads over to the domain of mode
and modality, e. g.
(M. 4.15)
toukr-en       isgil        jo-din
leave-PART     where        go-2SGOFUTSUB
“When you leave, where will you go?’Many examples in this category contain conditional clauses, e. g.
(IT IIL 5614 -ii 1)
in-na        ki-kanno-n               aman-na_   kedi-konno
you-here     come-2SGCOND-and         river-to | ascend-2SGCOND‘And if you come here and come up to the river’
kudi-ka        itar-a        nak-a                     tid-dre-lo
Kudi-oBJ       —send-ADJ_    travel downstreams-ADJ_give-1SGOFUTIND-EMPH‘I shall send Kudi downstreams to you’
                                                                                 85
The next two examples even more obviously demonstrate the modal use of the
old future which in various aspects seems to correspond to English constructions
with shall/will:
(M 11.12)
min-ka           id-dal            au-arre
what-OB)       = you-with          +do-1SGOFUTIND
‘what shall I do with you’(ChN 1.6-7)

‘what shall I say? whom shall I call you?","[84, 85, 86]"
"13.11 Economy and CommerceThe sales contracts and letters shed light on the local economy in the Nubian
kingdom. Although two documents (IT III 61 & 62) mention the tiram-, the Old
Nobiin rendering of the dirham, the important currency in the Arab world, the
economy was based on barter. Gold and silver pieces were given in exchange for
plots of land (see above) but grain is most often mentioned in letters as a com-
modity which was given in exchange for services or in payment for debts.”
Sometimes, references to special kinds of grain can be found which is measured
in mor or occasionally           in mafe also meaning    ‘bushel’.   In one letter (IT III 47),
e. g., the writer orders to “give out from the millet of Musana 1 mor of millet
through Maffuda, 6 to Papon, 6 to Aigajisi. Give 8 to Papon from the standing
crop through Tidawa, [...], give 6 to Aigajisi telling him to give them to Nukta.
Give 2 bushels to Papon”. Similar transactions are documented in various letters
from Qasr Ibrim. In IT III, 52, grain is exchanged for wine; besides grain, dates
are mentioned several times.",[242]
" Browne (ibid.) hypothesizes that -a is a reduced form of ia- ‘saying’ which con-
 sists of the verb -i plus adjunctive -a.
    -a does not only function as marker of direct speech, but also as complemen-
 tizer in Old Nobiin. That Browne’s hypothesis on the origin of -a is correct, is
shown below, where the non-reduced and the reduced forms are found as com-
plementizers in similar contexts. In these examples they are used with the verb
ank- ‘to think’:
(ITT 10

was described as second stage of the grammaticalization process above. The next
examples show the marker of direct speech/complementizer as marker of reason/
purpose clauses:
(Lec. 109.1)
Osi-j-e-a-ion                                seni-min-ne-so

                                                                                                           95
This sentence from the Lectionary is interesting in that -a and conjunction -ion
follow the imperative, resulting in a complex suffix -eaion. The connection with
the imperative as well as with the verb ik- (ek-) ‘to say’ is found in the following
examples from the documentary Qasr Ibrim text:
(IT II] 48.7-8)
ai-roko-lo            magak-ka_       _oss-e-a                     ek-eso
I-through-EMPH        magal-OB)       take oult-IMPER-COMP         tell-IMPER
‘tell in order that it be taken out to Magal through me’ (lit.: tell: ‘take out to Magal through me’)Without a following conjunction the suffix imperative singular -e and marker of
direct speech/complementizer -a result in the compound suffix -ea.
   Other examples of purpose clauses are:
(Lec. 112.10)
ted-in        tauo        _—_ da-I-gu-ka         janos-ij-e-s-a

 give-IMP-COMP        write-]     SGPRESIND-EMPH ‘I write that he may give (lit.: ‘saying: give!’)’ All the examples above have the imperative. It can be concluded that purpose
 clauses are expressed by the infinitive and the verb i- + adjunctive -a. The result-
 ing compound suffix -ia is often reduced to -a which functions as marker of
 direct speech.
     Wanting to summarize what has been discussed above we have to turn to the
 different forms as well as to the various functions and the possible relationship of
 the two.
    In Old Nobiin, a verb il- ‘to say’ is found which is often reduced to i-. It has
 various forms and functions depending on the contexts and the following end-
 ings. The forms and function can be listed as follows:
 96
 Form                                         Function
 i(l)-                                        reinforces another verb of speaking
 i- + -a adjunctive reduced to -a-            marker of direct speech
 i- + -a adjunctive or reduced -a             complementizer
 imperative + -ia or reduced -a               purpose clauseThe combination of the various additional endings needed to express the differ-
ent functions produces a wide range of compound suffixes, as e. g.
reduced -a                                            -a
i- + -a adjunctive                                    -ia
-ia + -ion conjunction ‘and’                          -iaion
imperative -e + reduced -a                            “a
imperative -e + emphatic -s(o) + reduced -a           -esoa, -esa
imperative -e + reduced -a + -ion conjunction         -eaion
imperative -ana + emphatic -s(o) + reduced -a         -anasoSome of these endings are obviously related to those listed by Lepsius (1880) for
Modern Nobiin under the different headings “imperative”, “conjunctions” and
“purpose clause”. On the way from Old to Modern Nobiin the imperative/jussive
dropped optional emphatic -so. Imperative markers -e and -ana are still present
from Old Nobiin. To these Lepsius (1880:139ff.) adds other endings which are
now well known from Old Nobiin. If we isolate these endings, we find:
SG        -ee the long vowel presumably going back to imperative -e + -a
          -ia(a)
PL        “a
          -ia(a)According to Lepsius (1880:139ff.) for the 3"" person jussive occasionally -ion
for the singular and plural is added to the 24 person endings, resulting in suffixes
38G       -eion
3PL       -anaionWhat we find here are not new endings for the imperative but the markers of
direct speech/complementizer of Old Nobiin. Either Lepsius misinterpreted these
endings due to the fact that all his examples for imperatives necessarily consisted
of either direct speech or complement clauses/indirect speech or we are dealing
with a reanalysis of Old Nobiin purpose clause as simple imperatives.
   Lepsius and Abel note that in the texts the different forms of the ending inter-
change arbitrarily. These variations consist of:
Form
Lepsius      -ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion
Abel         -eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye
Wemer     = -aya/-yon/-ayon/-eyon                                                                                    97
The endings given by Lepsius and Werner are similar, because they both include
at least some forms which add -ion/-yon. Werner (1987:342) lists -aya as non-
personal form meaning ‘saying’. The three other suffixes are translated as ‘he
said’, thus being interpreted by him as 3'4 person singular preterit which, how-
ever, has lost final -n according to his own paradigm. From the many examples
in the texts it seems much more probable that these endings go back to Old No-
biin forms with conjunction -ion ‘and’ (see above).
      All in all a table with the different forms and function of the verb-turned com-
plementizer in Modern Nobiin shows many similarities in function, but no longer
clear-cut divisions between the forms:
Form                                                 Function
-ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion                                 reinforces another verb of speaking
-eeye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye           }                  marker of direct speech

 future infinitive + -ia/-ion/-aiaa/-aion            purpose clause
                     -ecye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye   }
mas- ‘good’ + -ceye/-aiye/-iiye/-oiye                discourse markerIt seems that in the process of becoming Modern Nobiin several morphosyntactic
and functional processes took place. Compounding and cliticization occurred in
Old Nobiin when the reduced verb i- and adjunctive -a were combined to func-
tion as marker of direct speech and complementizer. The verb i- ‘to say’ was
desemanticized to become a complementizer. In Old Nobiin, different assimila-
tion processes were involved depending on the preceding words or phrases. The
resulting phonologically determined variations were obviously reanalyzed as free
alternatives, morpheme boundaries disappeared. The optional connection of the
endings with conjunction -ion ‘and’ was also included in the various processes
and a merger took place with the preceding verb-tumned complementizer. It also
was completely desemanticized. Although the use of the different ending is arbi-
trary today, Old and Modern Nobiin are still rather similar with regard to the
form and function of the elements described above. The most striking difference
concerns the use with purpose clauses. The various endings are still used to ex-
 press purpose, but have to follow the Old Future.","[95, 96, 97, 98]"
"       2.3 Linguistic Variation within the Texts       Although Old Nobiin is undoubtedly an earlier variant of Modern Nobiin, it was
       not in the strictest sense a standardized language. A close look at the text reveals
       some variations which shed light on the linguistic background of the scribes.
       These variations are to be expected as the region was linguistically heterogene-
       ous and it would oversimplify the situation to assume that all scribes were moth-
       er tongue speakers of Old Nobiin. In addition to that it goes without saying that
       loanwords from closely related Dongolese/Kenzi also spoken          in Nubia at the
       time of written Old Nobiin were borrowed into the language.
                                                                                               int as ET,

   The sales contract IT III, 36 is one of the texts of special interest in matters of
linguistic variation. It concerns the sale of land owned by a woman named Ka-
popi to another woman named Neuesi. With regard to content, it is fascinating
because it gives information about the position of women in Nubia at the end of
the 12th century (see chapter 13.8). Linguistically, it is interesting because it
contains numerous place names (see chapter 13.10) and most notably words not
found elsewhere. One of these is ana-biti (36 ii 3), presumably a beverage. It is
found as ana-piti in IT 34 1 29, and the second element -piti presumably corre-
sponds to -pitti in ChN. 5.11 and St. 22.5 where it is also found in a compound
denoting a beverage. The phoneme 6 of ana-biti is not part of the original inven-
tory of Nobiin and is also not found as allophonic variant of p. The modern cor-
respondence of Old Nobiin p is f so that it is not evidence of regular sound
change. -biti actually represents the expected Dongolese/Kenzi form because Old
Nobiin p, Nobiin f regularly correspond to Dongolese/Kenzi 5 and vice versa.
Although a scribal error cannot be excluded, the writing variant can also indicate
a different linguistic background. The latter assumption is supported by another
lexeme found in IT III 36, kal- ‘to eat’. The verb ‘to eat’ is one of the few lex-
emes diagnostic for classifying a wordlist as Nobiin or Dongolese/Kenzi by
origin. kal- is the Dongolese/Kenzi word shared by most of the other Nubian
languages whereas Old and Modern Nobiin have the isolated word kap-/kab-.
IT III 36 is the only instance where kal- is documented in writing but in the same
text, also kap- is found.   In the last lines of document   36, we get to know   about
the fee for the scribe who was paid in kind. He was supposed to receive one kol-
in tewiti which corresponds to modern Dongolese/Kenzi kal deewdi ‘flat bread’.
kol- is merely a variant of kal- described above. The alternative use of vowels o
and a is documented again in the same text with kap- and kop- ‘to eat’.
    In the documentary text from Qasr Ibrim, it can be observed that foreign words
or loanwords from Arabic enter into Old Nobiin. In the sales contract IT III 36, the
Arabic word ouati ‘wadi, valley’ is used, only documented in one other instance
in Sale 9 as wati. The use of Arabic wadi is remarkable because regarding the
modern languages, it is restricted to Kenzi. In Nobiin, we find the original farki
or the much more common Arabic loan khor both meaning ‘valley’. Armbruster
(1965:103) lists the latter in the form hoor also for Dongolese.
   Finally, egeti ‘kettle’ is another word which is found only in this text and in
modem   Kenzi, but not in Modern Nobiin.
   A close look at the Old Nobiin dictionary compiled by Browne (1996) on the
basis of the texts reveals that many entries have modern correspondences in
Dongolese and Kenzi, but not in Nobiin. Although numerous of these “missing”
correspondences can be explained by a later loss or/and replacement by Arabic
loanwords in Nobiin, this explanation cannot satisfy for all of the entries. One of
                                                                                    21
the longer texts, Chrysostomus Nubianus (Browne 1984), contains many Old
Nobiin words not documented in any other text. Whether this means that the text
was written in a dialect or style not preserved elsewhere or that it is only a coin-
cidence cannot be resolved. It has to be kept in mind that for the present, we have
a closed corpus of texts and can only work with what is on hand.","[20, 21, 22]"

 here. We also find the new future/intentional where the English version of the

 (GM 9,19)
 isonane-faaminii ai       ud-dan          _fa-aag-roo
 how long             I    you-with        1FUT-stay-] PLINTPRES-how
 isonane-faaminii ai       fa-saabri-rii                       ud-daani
 long                 1    1FUT-hold out-ISGINTPRES           you-with
 “How long shall I be with you? How long shail J put up with you?’This use is not surprising as many languages use this tense/aspect for similar
purposes. Also at the same time, this example consists of questions about the
future. A similar modal use is documented in the next example where fa- func-
tions as additional marker of a jussive:
(GM 1,38)
iig-a-tij-j-on                      irki        mool-kuu-I    fa-juur-oia
Say-ADJ-BEN-PL-3SGPRET              village    near-PL-to     IFUT-go-JUSSIPL
‘he said to them: “Let us go somewhere else to the towns nearby’ 299All contexts in which fa- is used have in common that they express possibility,
that they are speculative and irrealis.
    This even more applies when in Modern Nobiin fa(-a) is combined with the
suffixes of the preterit. Lepsius (1880:98ff.) gives a paradigm for what he calls
Juturum exactum but admits that it is not found in his texts. He stresses that even
 in conditionals where he would have expected the construction, the present tense
is regularly used. Abel’s informants interpret the preterit fa-ju-s as ‘I will proba-
bly go (my going depends on the several circumstances)’. This is mentioned in
contrast to the use with the present fa-ju-r ‘I will go (certainly, I will definitely                                                                                                       161
go)’. Werner describes constructions where fa(-a) is used with the preterit as
irrealis, as in
(Werner 1987:151)
ay faa    oos-is
1          IFUT   take out-ISGPRET
‘I was about to take out (but couldn’t)’In Abel’s Ermenne texts, two examples of fa(-a) with the preterit which are not
morphologically marked as conditionals are documented:
(Erm. 32)
    irin     kab-j-an-ahara          faalal-latoni
your         eat-OBJ-INFGEN-after plate-from
    wide jeloow-oos-a         iboo-ga            faalal-la fa-uudi-ti-s
    then wash-DIR-ADJ         your-father-OB)    plate-on IFUT-put-INDOBJ-1SGPRET
    ‘after you eating from the plate I then cleaned it and put (the food) on the plate for your father’    This is a temporal clause with the subordinator -ahara ‘after’ followed by a ver-
    bal complex consisting of two verbs the first of which has adjunctive -a, the
    second is marked for tense/aspect. Abel interprets the sentence as a covert condi-
    tional which is not the whole explanation. In the narrative, several temporal
    clauses with -ahara are present, none is followed by the future intentional, e. g.
    (Erm 17)
    taf-fab-nani   auwok-ka eskalee-ltoni              kis-siin-ahara        iiga-tir-oon
    his-father-GEN night-OBJ water-wheel-from          come-INFPRET-after    said-BEN-3SGPRET     ‘after his father returned from the water-wheel at night, he said to him’     Accordingly, one would expect the simple preterit in sentence 32 above. The
     explanation for the use of the future intentional preterit seems to be that in this
     case it is constructed as an irrealis as opposed to all other occurrences of -ahara
     in the text. It is constructed in such a way because the proposition is wrong, the
     woman speaking is lying, the things she is talking about never happened. Thus,
     we have another example for the use of fa(a)- with the preterit functioning as
     irrealis.
        Abel’s explanation of an underlying conditional might apply for the next sen-
     tence which also presents a future intentional with the preterit.
     (Erm 9)
     burgas-ka ken-enne-kir-os-a                          urre-ka-tiira-go-wee-ka
     run-OB) _ in order to-carry out-come-DIR-ADJ         south-OBJ-to-and-one-OBJ     kalle-ka-tiira-go-wee-ka — enne-kir-os-a

circumcision-his-OBJ IFUT-make-BEN-ISGPRET    nice (white?)-ADV‘in order to carry out the run, I will carry out one to the south and the north and I will make his
circumcision beautifully’This is a final or purpose clause consisting of a verbal complex with two verbs
the first of which has adjunctive -a, the second is marked for tense/aspect. The
sentence contains a promise to God to be fulfilled after the birth of a son. The
condition this sentence refers to is uttered at the beginning of the paragraph
which the example above closes. The use of the past after fa- reveals that we are
dealing with an irrealis and as a matter of fact the promise the story talks about
could never have been fulfilled because of the speaker’s death.
    What has been called innovated future in the title of this chapter fulfills sev-
eral functions in the tense, aspect and modal system of Nobiin. The few exam-
ples from Old Nobiin which indicate something about the origin of the innova-
tion consist of religious predictions which seem to have the status of intentionals.
In Moder Nobiin, examples for the whole range of tense/aspect/modal marking
can be found. When there is a temporal specification fa- may function as future
tense marker. Without temporal reference, the element regularly marks an inten-
tional. In the translation of the gospel, prophecies              and predictions      are docu-
mented which correspond to those in the Old Nobiin texts. This leads over to the
frequent use of /a- in irrealis constructions which can also be observed with the
conditional. In addition, fa- is used in different kinds of constructions where
modal verbs are necessary in English. Finally, fa- is restricted to the function as
irrealis when used with the preterit.","[161, 162, 163]"

1. Introduction
 It is not often that we can observe language change in a language over a period
of more than one thousand years. Nobiin-Nubian seems to be the only language
belonging to the Nilo-Saharan phylum where this is possible. The present study
analyzes language change in Nobiin over a period of about a millennium. This
analysis is based on textual data from the older stage of Nobiin written in the
medieval period between the 8th and the 15th centuries, called Old Nobiin
throughout this book, as well as present-day Nobiin, as it is known through the
work of scholars from the nineteenth century onward until the latest grammatical
and lexical studies of Werner (1987) and Khalil (1996), called Modern Nobiin
here.
     A few introductory notes on terminology seem to be indicated at this point.
The Nobiin language was and is spoken in a region called Nubia. The geographi-
cal term, which will frequently be used in this study, comprises the area of As-
wan around the Ist Cataract in the north (see map) and the region around ed-
Debba between the 34 and 4th Cataracts in the south. This means that the north-
ernmost part of Nubia lies in the modern country of Egypt but the greatest part of
Nubia belongs to present-day Sudan. Traditionally, the region between the Ist and
2nd Cataracts was referred to as “Lower Nubia” and the region south of it as
“Upper Nubia”, with the Batn el-Hajar or kid-n-tu “Belly of Stones” as a stretch
of the Nile difficult to pass as a natural barrier in between the two divisions. The
construction of the Aswan High Dam in the 1960s brought about dramatic
changes for the Nubian people and the region. People were relocated in regions
far from their original homes and great parts of Lower Nubia were flooded. At
the same time, the construction project led to the first collaborative international
rescue effort involving UNESCO. The so-called “Nubia Campaign” aimed at
salvaging the archaeological sites threatened by the Aswan High Dam. Most of
the Old Nobiin texts which served as a basis for the grammatical analyses in this
book were found in the course of several archaeological campaigns conducted
during the “Nubia Campaign”.
    Throughout this book, the chronological and historical category “medieval pe-
riod” is repeatedly used. “Medieval period” or “Middle Ages” usually designate
a period in European history mostly dated from the fall of the Western Roman
                                                                                          os nat adoro al
Empire in the 5% century until about the end of the 15th/early           16 century,
amongst other things marked by the beginning of European overseas expansion.
As part of the European historical periodization, the term “medieval period” and
the concept behind it cannot and should not easily and uncritically be transferred
and applied to the history of non-European regions. Early scholars of Nubian
languages and history used the designation “Christian Nubia” for the period after
the “fall” of the Meroitic Empire and a short “Dark Age” and before the final
Islamization of Nubia, i. e. between the 6th and the 14th/]5th centuries. As late as
2002, Welsby divides the history of Nubia along traditional terms as “Pagan”, a
term which is not only biased, but also pejorative, “Christian”, and “Muslim”.
This tripartition suggests that history happens in events at identifiable dates and
that religion is the defining factor for the periodization of history.
     In this book, the designation “medieval period” is mainly used for the era
 when Old Nobiin was a written language in Nubia. As the oldest document is
 dated to 787 and the youngest to 1484 this compasses a period of about 700
 years. In the appendix dealing with written sources, this period is expanded to
 nearly a millennium because it includes and critically assesses the work of Chris-
 tian historiographers on Nubia which starts as early as the 6th century. So it
 seems justified to talk about the Medieval Period or the Medieval Millennium
                                                                                             osises Sines
 without referring to religious categories or transferring European periodization to
 Nubia. Nubia had “its own” medieval period in history which was characterized
  by a highly organized kingdom interacting with its southern, eastern, western and
  northern neighbors—of different religious affiliation—and also with the Byzan-
  tine Empire outside the African continent.
      The older stage of the language analyzed in this study has been known as
  “Old Nubian” for about a century. Although it is still used by scholars of the
  various Nubian languages, this designation is not adequate and appears anti-
  quated, not the least because Nubian is the name of a language family consisting
  of different subgroups of languages not mutually intelligible. The language
  called “Old Nubian”, however, doesn’t represent an early stage of the whole
  language family but of only one of its members, the Nobiin language, which is
  moreover isolated within the family (Bechhaus-Gerst 1984/85, 1990, 1996). To
 call this language “Old Nubian” is at least as misleading as would be calling
 “Old English” “Old Germanic” which nobody would ever think of. One reason
 for the misleading designation lies in the history of Nubian studies. For a long
 time, only the Nubian languages spoken in the Nile Valley were known to Euro-
 pean scholars. They automatically assumed a closer genetic relationship between
 these “Nile Nubian” languages which only later turned out to be not the case.
 When the first pieces of medieval literature were discovered, the writing was
 deciphered and the linguistic affiliation was identified, it seemed natural to call it
 12
Old Nubian, although Griffith (1913:68) in the first comprehensive editing of the
then known texts remarked that “the agreement with the Fadija-Mahass dialect
 [= today’s Nobiin] as opposed to the Kenzi-Dongolese dialect is very clearly
marked”. It is recommended here that the term “Old Nubian” should be alto-
gether abandoned in favor of the more accurate “Old Nobiin”.
     The present study is not a work of linguistic theory but it also doesn’t restrict
 itself to mere descriptions of different language states. It tries to reveal processes
of language change and grammaticalization from Old to Moder Nobiin but also
within Old and Modern Nobiin respectively. Although the development and
changes in the nominal and pronominal systems are discussed, the focus was put
on the verbal morphology and syntax. Nevertheless, this book can only represent
the beginning of the study of language change in Nobiin. In 1991, the mentor of
Old Nobiin studies, the late G. Michael Browne, expressed what he regarded as
desiderata of future scholarly work. On top of his list he posted the need for a
diachronic grammar which would treat the relationship between Old and Modern
Nobiin but also diachronic patterns within Old Nobiin. This study hopefully is a
first step towards this end. As most of the work on Old Nobiin has been done by
classical scholars and the texts are available only in non-transcribed and non-
segmented form, the numerous examples from the texts may also serve to inter-
est scholars with different backgrounds for the interesting subject of language
change in Nobiin.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]"

The development of fir-/den- in verbal complexes is completely different from
the one of -(oJ)os/-ed which indicates that its function was different from the
 outset. The next two examples demonstrate the above-mentioned complexes with
jan- ‘to trade, to exchange’. The second one includes both verbs, tir- and den-, in
 one sentence:
(IT 11. 32,15)

‘After Papasinen, daughter of Magosi, sold it to me, I sold (it) to Maffouda Choiak-eikfi(l) and
Pampigon his wife.’The first sentence has two nouns marked as objects. Old Nobiin, as has been
shown before, does not distinguish morphologically between direct or indirect
objects. Although directionality might have figured in the use of tir-/den-, a dif-
ferent function seems to be predominant.
   At first sight, the notion of directionality seems also to be implied in the fol-
lowing sentence.
(IT Il 47, 2)
musania-n         emella             os-a           tij-j-eso
Musana-gen        plot of millet (?) take out-ADJ_~—give-PL-IMPERSG“give out from Mussana’s millet (...]’A direction ‘away from’ a reference point or deictic center, consisting of Mussa-
Jia’s millet, is, however, already expressed in the verb os- ‘to take out’ itself. The
function of tir- must therefore be explained differently.
   The examples from Old Nobiin show that these verbs promote an additional
participant which might be oblique. Usually, they do not affect the argument
structure of the verb they follow. Actually, the construction with tir-/den- can be
explained        as an applicative, characteristic,             for example,    of Bantu    languages.
There too, an underlying indirect or oblique object is realized as a surface direct
object and the verb bears a distinctive inflection expressing the semantic relation
of the surface direct object. Although this is found in many examples in Old
Nobiin, in other instances the oblique object is expressed as such on the surface >
                                                                                                     143
but nevertheless marked at the verb. As can also be observed in Old Nobiin, the
indirect or oblique objects need not to be explicit, i. e. expressed on the surface
at all. Semantically, the complex often expresses that the action is happening for
a beneficiary, i. e. they function as benefactive. These functions of the verb ‘to
give’ are found in many languages of the world. Some examples from Old No-
biin texts are:

          10.8 “Perfect(ive)”          This construction originates in a verbal complex with the verb kon-/kun-/ko- ‘to
          have’ (all three alternative forms are already present in Old Nobiin) as second
          verb. Such a complex is absent in the religious-theological texts, but Zyhlarz
          (1928:167) was the first to notice two examples of this complex as part of a graf-
          fito in Jebel Adda published by Griffith (1913:64ff.). The second verb follows
          the adjunctive -a- suffixed to the first verb and is marked as 34 person singular
          present subjunctive or indicative.

          find a total of five instances for kon-/kun-/ko- as second element in a complex in
          a corpus of 32 texts of different lengths. All examples but one are from personal
          letters or requests, one comes from a commercial transaction.

          nation-SUBJ approach-PERF-3SGPRESSUB
          ‘the nation having approached’          The example is rather clear-cut grammatically with adjunctive -a- deleted—as it
          is also found in similar constructions—and -ko- following the verb directly. In
          the next example, additional elements and another verb precede -ko-:
           (IT Ill 46.2-3)
           id-doko           nisiti   tor-a       pi-r-ko-n
           you-through cleansing      enter-ADJ   be-CAUS-PERF-3SGPRESSUB           ‘[after] he has caused (them) to enter cleansing through you’           This is a more complex example as Browne (1991:97) interprets a predicative
           periphrastic construction with -pi- ‘to be’ and reconstructs tor-ra pi- with the -r-
           of the predicative deleted. In his grammar (Browne 2002:59, n. 69), however, he
           came to the conclusion that -pi- is only found in participle periphrastics, because
           no example for preceding predicative can be found. It seems probable that it is           172
  not a periphrastic construction but rather a verbal complex and the verb for- is
  followed by adjunctive -a- instead of a predicative -ra-. The second verb in the
  complex is pi- ‘to be’ and the first half of the complex is thus resembling ‘stative
  constructions’ as they are discussed under 10.9. The complex is marked as causa-
  tive by suffix -r- and is completed by -ko ‘to have’ and the 3"" person singular
  subjunctive marker.
      In the next sentence, adjunctive -a- is present which seems to come along with
  the longer variant of ‘to have’ -kon-/-kun-. The complex is also marked as indica-
  tive.

  ‘he has kept you upon your throne’  The last two examples are in the preterit. Although the longer form -kon- is pre-
  sent, adjunctive -a- is missing in the first one.

  ‘the king has ordered you’  In summary,        it can be said that in most of the examples,   the second verb is
  marked as present, but two show past tense suffixes. In two instances, the unre-
  duced -kun/-kon follows the adjunctive -a which is absent with the reduced form
  -ko and in the past tense. These few sentences are insufficient to find any regular-
  ity. They indicate, however, that a process where the verb ‘to have’ was used as
  an aspect marker had presumably started not later than the 12‘ century in spoken
 Nobiin and was occasionally used by individuals in informal written communi-
 cation. Until the end of the documentation of Old Nobiin, it was, however, rarely
 used. Although nothing definitive can be deduced, the few examples point to kon-
 / kun-/ko- marking a ‘classical’ perfect aspect: It is the verb ‘to have’ that can be
 used with different tenses and as far as the contexts are undisputable a state re-
 sulting from an earlier event is expressed in each sentence.
     In Modern Nobiin the situation has changed. The element -kon/-ko is suffixed
 to a verb but only takes the past tense suffixes. The construction with adjunctive
 -a- is lost. The complex is rarely used in the affirmative, but has replaced the old
                                                                                   173
past in the negative (see chapters 6.2 & 9.1). The paradigms which the different
authors present are the following:

2                    -kossokom                                    2                  -kossokom

plural forms have been reduced. Lepsius’ 1st person plural suffix is more com-
plex than Abel’s. The latter might be a reduction as well as a dialectal variation.
Lepsius and Abel mix and confuse two rather different constructions—the one
discussed here with -kon/-ko, another one with -ken—which they regard as sim-
ple variations. The -ken construction, however, originates in a periphrastic con-
struction of Old Nobiin and marks a habitual as has been described in chap-
ter 9.4. Lepsius (1880:88) and Reinisch (1879:80) call -kon/-ko perfect markers.
Werner (1987:175ff.) fails to distinguish the formation from the preterit and
describes it as expressing an action which was completed in the past.
        In Abel’s Ermenne text are only two examples of an affirmative perfect:
    (Erm. 112)
    hataruni        sultani    buruu-kolot-ta    unn-e-c-ag-kun                  in-too-nani     —_ag-aau-week-koni

    plex where only the last verb (doll-os-on) is marked as 3'4 person singular pret-
    erit. This is not quite typical for verbal complexes because the tense/aspect mark-
    ing of the last verb differs from the one of the other verbs. If we take a look at
    the meaning of the event told here it is rather obvious that the two verbs with
    -kun- refer to events prior to the one described by the last verb.
        In the next example, a verbal complex ends with -kon/-ko and is also marked
    as preterit. As the sentence is in direct speech, the chronological reference point
    is the time of speaking.","[171, 172, 173, 174]"

4, Pronouns
4.1 Personal PronounsThe following pronouns function as the subject of a clause. In Old Nobiin, the
so-called juncture vowel -u- could be suffixed. For the 1st person plural, Old
Nobiin had a distinction between inclusive and exclusive. This distinction is lost
in Modem       Nobiin which only retained the former exclusive -u-. Otherwise, the
subject pronouns remained unchanged.

ized by an additional -i/-ii suffix (Lepsius 1880:56) which according to Werner
(1987:116) is marked by high tone.

3                tarii                          teriiWerner presumed that the suffix might be an eroded remnant of the Old Nobiin
case marker -i/. As, however, the subject pronouns are not marked for case in Old
Nobiin this is highly improbable. A semantic difference between the two sets is
not indicated by the texts. It seems possible that the -i/-ii suffix is a former junc-
ture vowel. As has been described above we find an annective -u or -i between
elements which closely cohere. This can be the case with appositions and attribu-
tives but it also optionally binds postpositions to the preceding nouns or phrases
and pronouns to the rest of the sentences. Although most examples show the
vowel -u, -i can occasionally be found:                                                                                   53
(IT1412)
it-i   inno        — douar[aJenkan
you        there     be-COND‘if you had been there’Personal pronouns with suffixed juncture vowels -u or -i are rather widespread in
Old Nobiin texts so that the modern paradigm might go back to Old Nobiin pro-
nouns plus juncture vowel. Browne (1991:288) has, however, pointed out that
even in Old Nobiin, the juncture vowel is more often missing than present and
that the unmotivated changes between -u and -i may actually indicate some sort
of neutral vowel, such as a. Here, we find two counter-arguments against the
proposed origin of the second set of modern subject pronouns.
        If Abel’s translation can be trusted some sort of emphatic connotation can still
be deducted for Modern Nobiin, as in the following example:
(Erm. 78)
ir-i   kutt-a              kumbuu-n-gifir          malick-ka__dett-a             gammi-kac-c-a

bed-one-OB)    make bed-DIR-PRED             bed-into           egg-GEN-shell-OBJ | put-PLOBJ-PRED
“you get up, collect all egg shells, gather them, make a bed, and into the bed put the egg shells’In other examples the emphatic connotation is more difficult to trace:
(Erm. 80)
kumbuu-n-gifiri          kafu-kik-ani      ter-i      —ik-ka      fa-issig-inan-ani
egg-GEN-shell            crackle-COND      they       you-OBJ      FUT-ask-3PpL-then (PART)
 ‘if the egg shells crackle, they will ask you’ In conclusion one has to state that the origin of the -i/-ii suffix remains obscure.
    The object of the personal pronoun is marked by the suffix Old Nobiin -ka;
 Modern Nobiin -ga(/-ka) which is the regular nominal case suffix. As can be
 seen below, various rules of assimilation produce the actual paradigms. The
 Modern Nobiin object suffix is -ga as 1st person singular and plural shows. Al-
 though in Modern Nobiin the regular assimilation rule produces /r/ + /g/ > /rl’
 (Werner 1987:41), the Old Nobiin geminated consonants are preserved which are
 the result of the very common Old Nobiin regressive assimilation r + k —> kk.

4.2 Genitive and Possessive PronounsOld Nobiin has two sets of possessive pronouns which are identical to the geni-
tive of the personal pronouns (see Chapter 3.2.1 on nominal case marking). The
genitive markers -(i)n or -na are suffixed to the personal pronouns and assimila-
tion rules operate. The possessive pronoun stands before its noun:
                    Old Nobiin
IsG                 an, anna                IPL excl.   un, unna
                                                incl.   en, enna
2                   in, inna                2           un, unna
3                   tan, tanna              3           ten, tennaThe difference between the two sets is not easy to determine. The longer forms
are predicatives by origin (GEN -m + PRED -a). In many examples, the shorter -n
forms can be regarded as simple possessives whereas the others can be described
as objective genitives or as dependent upon a noun in the predicative or the sub-
ject of a verbal noun, e. g.
(M. 12.2-3)
in      tanna_   kip-sil
this   his       eat-PARTPRETII
‘this which he ate’ = lit.: ‘this his having eaten’In many phrases, however, the distinction seems to be blurred and it can be con-
cluded that it already was under way to disappear at the Old Nobiin stage docu-
mented by the written texts.
   The two sets of possessives represent the Old Nobiin standard. Fortunately,
unassimilated forms are preserved mostly in translation of parts of the Old Tes-
tament. These show more archaic forms than the bulk of texts:
2sG                irin           (Browne 1987:77)
3sG                tarin          (IT 12120)
3PL                terin          (Browne 1987:87)A third set of possessives is found, for example, in the letters from Qasr Ibrim
but is notably absent in nearly all the religious-theological texts. Zyhlarz pro-                                                                               55
posed that these pronouns were only present, when the possessive is independent
or used as apposition to its noun. The forms found in letters from Qasr Ibrim are:
1sG                anni          (IT III 52.5, Browne 1984:55)
2sG                inni          (IT HI, 26.1; IT Hl. 5717)
3sG                 tanni        (IT III, 51.4,6)
IPL                 enni         (Browne, ibid.)These possessives follow the noun and represent a late development of Old No-
biin which leads over to Modern Nobiin. Their constructions correspond to no-
minalized attributives where genitival -n is suffixed to an adverb or postposi-
tional phrase. In the few Old Nobiin examples, we find postpositions attached to
the pronouns, as e. g. in anni-kille ‘to me’ (lit.: ‘to of mine’, IT III 52.5) or anni-
ka ‘me’ (lit.: ‘that of mine’, St. 10.10-11).
   According to Werner (1987:117ff.), Modern Nobiin has three sets of posses-
sive pronouns. The first one is identical to the genitive of the innovated subject
pronouns with suffixed -i/-ii.
 IsG                ayiin                   IPL             uuiin
2                   iriin                   2               uriin
3                   tariin                  3               teriinThese pronouns precede the noun, phrase or sentence they are dependent on. In
the sentences collected by Werner, however, as well as in the large Ermenne text,
preceding possessives are restricted to kinship terminology (see below). Only in
Lepsius’ conservative translation of the Gospel according to Marc, we find ex-
 amples for preceding possessives in constructions such as:
 (GM 8,19)
 aiyiin        kaba_ = dija__birti-sin-laa
 IsGposs       bread   five break-PARTPRETII-in
    ‘in my having broken five breads”        “he second set is identical to the classical Old Nobiin paradigm   (see above)
    minus the 1st person plural inclusive form:
     IsG             an                         IPL          uun
    2                 in                        2            unn
    3                tan                        3            tenn    These pronouns follow their noun as do the innovated ones of the third set:
    IsG               anni                      IPL          uuni
    2                 inni                      2            unni

    56
In kinship terminology, which is rarely used without possessives, Modern Nobiin
preserves an archaic paradigm with prefixed pronouns:
              Old Nobiin               Modern Nobiin
IsG           apol                     aboo            ‘my father’
2             ipol                     iboo            ete.
3             tappapil                 taffaabTPL           en papi(l) (incl.)
              oun papil (excl.)        uuffaab
2             *ouppapil (unattested)   —_uffaab
3             *teppapil (unattested)   teffaabThe first and second persons singular are irregular and fossilized forms. Final -/
may frequently vanish in Old Nobiin as in a sales contract (IT III 40.33) where
we find en papi ‘our father’. In Modern Nobiin, final -/ has completely disap-
peared. The phonological changes are regular. In IT III 35, we find one instance
of an irregular an papil instead of apol ‘my father’. This could be a title, as
Browne (1991:86) suggested but also an analogous construction by a scribe with
a first language different from Old Nobiin.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57]"

        30
3. The Noun
3.1 NumberOld Nobiin has a common nominal plural marker -gu. Much less common are
the two markers -ri-gu and -ni-gu. Zyhlarz’ (1928:36) attempt to divide these two
along the categories animated (-ri-gu) vs. inanimate (-ni-gu) has to be rejected.
Browne (2002:31) associated -ri-gu with loan words from Greek, but only as an
optional variant, and his first example mug-ri-gu ‘dogs’ can not be regarded as a
Greek loan at all. As -ri- as well as -ni- precede the basic plural marker -gu we
can assume that an original distinction which complemented -gu lost its function
and meaning. In all cases, -gu may be deleted. The plural markers precede the
case markers (see below).
    In Modern Nobiin, nominal plural marking is more complex due to loans from
the related Nubian languages Dongolese/Kenzi (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996). The
language has four plural markers two of which are absent in Old Nobiin texts.
The Old Nobiin basic plural morphemes -gu as well as the less common -ri (with
-gu always absent) are preserved, -ni-gu is lost. According to Werner (1987:80),
-gu and -ri are marked by high tone. Two low tone suffixes -ii and -ncii are mod-
ern loans. In Dongolese, -i is suffixed to a noun with a terminal consonant, -nci
to a terminal vowel (Armbruster 1960:159). In Nobiin, the use of the borrowed
plural suffixes is not restricted to loanwords from Dongolese. Which of the four
plural markers of Modern Nobiin is used with a certain noun is not predictable
and seems to be optional. Lepsius (1880:32) tried to find some regularity and
related -nci to nouns with a final long vowel and accent on the last syllable if
disyllabic. According to Werner (1987:81), words ending in high tone -ée take
plural -ncii in most cases.
    If we take the example of -gi(i) ‘uncle, mother’s brother’, it takes plural suffix
-ncii according to Lepsius (1880:32). In Abel’s Ermenne text which has numer-
ous examples for ‘uncle’, gi- has plural marker -gw suffixed in all instances.
Khalil in his Nobiin dictionary (1996:26) gives both suffixes as optional alterna-
tives. All things considered it can be concluded that Nobiin and Dongolese Nu-
bian language contact added to the Nobiin system of plural marking and made it
unpredictable with regards to which suffix has to be used with a certain noun.","[30, 31]"

 because—amongst other things—they specify an indirect object in a verbal com-
 plex. Still, tir-/den- as second element are used in a verbal complex after the
 adjunctive -a which is, however, often missing. The following paradigm shows
 the modern endings which are contracted from -tir- plus present tense personal
 suffixes as listed by Werner (1987:186):

 The change from Old to Modern Nobiin can been observed in the next example
 where jan-a tir- is used in a complex which conveyed the meaning of ‘to sell’ in
 Old Nobiin:                                                                                   |

 ‘his uncle: “it is good”- [he said], bought two dresses for him’ Here, directionality which characterized the Old Nobiin complex is irrelevant.
 Instead, the second object, a benefactive, is marked by fir-.              _.
     In the texts, it can be observed that some of the verbs, most notably iig- ‘to
 say’, are hardly ever used without tir-/den-. Examples are:
 (Erm. 131)
 [...] sultani   iig-a-tir-oon

‘I have said to you everything in advance’iig- ‘to say’ has an underlying oblique argument. This must be marked at the verb
whether it is realized as a surface direct object, as it is in the second example, or
not realized, as in the first.
   In addition to iig- ‘to say’ Lepsius (1880:139) lists a few other verbs which
mostly take tir-/den-. These verbs are: wiidkire- ‘to answer’, gafre ‘to forgive’,
arre ‘to bring’, nadiife ‘to clean’, faai- ‘to write, prescribe’, iidir- ‘to send’, aaw-
‘to do’, and fedd- ‘to beg’. His examples come from the gospel of St. Mark, such as:

Similarly, examples from the Ermenne narrative illustrate the use and function of
tir-/den-, e. g.

 Summarizing it can be said that tir-/den- are documented in Old and Modern
 Nobiin as independent verbs with the meaning ‘to give someone (2""4/3""d person)’
 and ‘to give to me/us (1st person)’. The verbs are found in verbal complexes
 following the adjunctive -a which was occasionally missing at the older stage
and is more often omitted in present-day Nobiin. It did function and still func-
tions as an applicative. Underlying indirect or oblique object are marked by fir-/
den- regardless of whether they are realized as surface directs objects, surface
oblique objects or not realized on the surface at all. This construction can be
regarded as rather unchanged in the process of languages development from the
Medieval period to the present.","[144, 145, 146, 147]"
"
2.4 Modern Nobiin and the Nubian Language FamilySeveral times now, the Dongolese/Kenzi language has been mentioned besides
Nobiin and a few notes concerning their relationship seem to be appropriate.
   At least since the beginning of the 20th century, it has been claimed that a ge-
netically defined Nubian language family consisting of a Nile Nubian and a Hill
(Kordofanian) Nubian subgroup, Birgid (spoken in Southern Darfur and now
extinct) and Midob (in Northern Darfur) exists. Attempts at classification for a
long time focused on the languages of the so-called Nile Nubian branch which
 were known to the European linguistic community much longer than other Nu-
 bian languages. The group was divided into the Mahas/Fadijja language on the
 one side, and the Dongolese/Kenzi language on the other side. For the Ma-
 has/Fadijja continuum, Bell introduced the self-designation Nobiin in 1974. The
 initially implicit assumption that the geographically adjacent Nubian languages
 of the Nile valley were also more closely related genetically became explicit in
 the discussion of the homeland of the Nubians. Basically, two alternatives were
 proposed: Either the Darfur and Hill Nubians were fugitives from the Nile Valley
 or the Nile Nubians migrated from an original homeland somewhere in the west
  of the Nile. The problem of the homeland was solved more than twenty years
  ago (Behrens 1981, Thelwall 1982, Bechhaus-Gerst 1984/85) and will not be
  discussed here. More importantly, however, it was also shown that geographic
  adjacency of languages and their speakers does not necessarily imply a particu-
  larly close genetic relationship. In the course of several studies (Bechhaus-Gerst
   1984/85, 1989, 1996), it could be proven that speakers of the different Nubian
  languages of the Nile Valley undoubtedly reached the region at a time interval of
  more than 1500 years. The first arrivals were the predecessors of the Nobiin at
  about 1500 BC, followed by the early Dongolese/Kenzi at the beginning of the
 Common Era. It could furthermore be shown that a genetically defined Nile Nu-
 bian group never existed, but that the close relationship between the modern lan-
 guages was caused by intensive language contact. The Nobiin language in fact
 constitutes an isolated branch of the Nubian language family, whereas the Dongo-
 22
lese/Kenzi language is genetically closely related to the Hill Nubian languages of
Kordofan. Nobiin and Dongolese/Kenzi were and are not mutually intelligible.
    Additional remarks concerning the term Dongolese/Kenzi seem to be re-
quired. Dongolese and Kenzi are closely related languages which can be classi-
fied as dialects, although they were and are not spoken in adjacent regions. Don-
golese is spoken to the south and Kenzi to the north of the Nobiin speech area.
This is a relatively recent development. It is known from written sources that the
Kenzi dialect came into being in the course of the 13th and 14th centuries when
the Arab Beni Kanz became the Nubian Kenzi through intermarriage with Nubi-
ans from Dongola, as a result of which language shift from Arabic to Nubian
took place. This variant of Dongolese, spoken by the Beni Kanz developed into
what is known as the Kenzi language.
    This book deals with language change in Nobiin but it doesn’t actually discuss
the reasons for the different kinds of change. Although in each case presented
below arguments for an internal development might be found, much of what will
be analyzed must be regarded as a result of the language contact addressed
above. The sociolinguistic setting and its consequences have been studied in
detail in Bechhaus-Gerst (1996) and need not be repeated here. At this point,
however, it should be noted that the Nobiin language underwent significant
changes which for the most part can be traced back to a long-term and intensive
contact with speakers of Dongolese/Kenzi and presumably Arabic and Beja
speakers who either learnt Nobiin as second language or shifted to Nobiin as
their first language. The consequences of this process were classified as “‘inter-
ference through shift” (see e. g. Thomason & Kaufman 1988) which results from
imperfect learning during a process of language acquisition. Speakers shifting to
a so-called target language “‘fail” to learn the new language perfectly, but keep
some of the features of their original language or continue to make “mistakes”
when using the new language. These features or “mistakes” may even spread to
the target language when they are imitated by speakers of that language. Thomas
& Kaufmann (ibid., 39) point out that interference through shift begins with
sound and syntax and may even include morphology before words of the original
language appear in the target language.
    Because of its status as a quasi-official language in medieval Nubia, Old No-
biin doubtlessly represented a target language for speakers of other languages of
the Nubian Nile Valley and its hinterland. Social and economic mobility was
presumably dependent on linguistic skills including a certain competence in Old
Nobiin. This situation only changed when Old Nobiin lost its prestigious position
to Arabic, a process which started in the 13th century, but was not completed until
the end of the 15th century when Old Nobiin was no longer employed in writing.","[22, 23]"

SimultaneitySimultaneous action or events could be expressed by the bare participle or sub-
junctive in the subordinate or complement clause in Old Nobiin. Examples are
(M. 8, 7-10)

‘and when his son, cooking, placed to him, eating, he ingested’A frequent marker of simultaneity is the temporal conjunction -tauklo which is a
compound          of tauk- ‘time’ and the postposition -/o ‘in, at’ and has the literal
meaning of ‘at the time’. Depending on difference or identity of subjects, either
the subjunctive or the participle is found. Examples are
(CRN. 9.16-18)

ment’, unfortunately without a context. The other authors record the Arabic loan
wagid/wagdi ‘time’ which seems to have replaced the original Nubian term.
   Instead of Old Nobiin -tauklo, one way to express simultaneity in Modern
Nobiin includes subordinating conjunction/complementizer -taan(ii) ‘while, as’,
as in the following example from the gospel
 198

 the end of the roots’)’ The construction is also found in several instances in the Ermenne narrative, as
 e. g. in:
 (Erm. 47)
wildii-wee-ku-dani         _tan-gii-guu-noo-ka-tiira.      _batar-in-tani       nog-on-aiye

this-way     _frighten-PASS-ADJ-STAT-PRESPART-while          boy-to       go-3SGPRET“while he was so frightened, he went to the boy’Modern Nobiin -faan(ii) seems to be related to Old Nobiin -fauklo in the same
way as modern -faan is related to older -pau(u)(ka) discussed below. Final -n
could have originated in the conjunction -on ‘and, but’ which, however, is used
in Old Nobiin as introduction to a temporal apodosis.
   There is another construction in Modem                           Nobiin which is often used in, but
not restricted to past contexts. Modern Nobiin keellaa is a compound consisting
of keel ‘border(line), limit, region, area’ and postposition -/a ‘in, at’. An example
from the gospel is
(GM 2.5)
iesu-un      amaana    tenni-g        _naas-siin        keellaa   mohleek          iig-a-tir-on

(Erm. 108)

Nobiin. Followed by the postposition -/o ‘in(to), from’, it is used in comparative
clauses of the type
(Lec. 108.5-6)
uer-in-il           duk-koannoa     enna     uer-en-en              kello
one-be-PARTPRES     be-3PLPURP      our      ome-be-PARTPRES        as/like‘in order that they may be one, as we are one’When postpositions were discussed (see chapter 3.3) it was shown that the two
postpositions -/a and -/o overlapped in meaning and function in Old Nobiin and
were already interchangeable. In Modern Nobiin, only -/a survived as a produc-
tive element and -/o was only preserved in a few lexicalized contexts. Compara-
tive clauses marked by kello express a relationship of equality in contrast to
either superiority or inferiority. This seems to correspond to the use of keellaa in
Modern Nobiin to express simultaneity as opposed to anteriority or posteriority.
It is therefore plausible that the modern use in temporal clauses originates in the
old comparative clause construction with kello.
   kello is often used with the preterit participle but in the gospel also instances
with the present or future/intentional are found, as e. g. in:
(GM 12.23)
kuttiid-la        fa-kutt-innan          keellaa   ideen nai-n-an-arii
resurrection-in   IFUT-rise-3PLPRES      when      wife   who-GEN-become-3SGOFUT ‘in the resurrection, when they rise again, which one’s wife will she be’ When used with the preterit, it is sometimes difficult to draw the line between
 simultaneity and anteriority and some examples are open for interpretation. This
 is not the case with the next example from the gospel:
 (GM 14.26)
 hamdu-g _ banpi-kes-san     keela                 seetuun      mulee-la    juu-san
 hymn-OB) = say-PERF-3PLPRET after/when            oil          mountain-to go-3PLPRET
 ‘after singing a hymn, they went to the mount of olives’ It has been explained before that Lepsius confused habitual marker -ken- and
 perfect marker -kun-, so that -ken- in the examples is presumably a mistake on
 Lepsius’ side because the habitual makes no sense here. The use of the past per-200
 fect followed by keela indicates a sequence of events where the singing precedes
 the going out to the Mount of Olives.","[197, 198, 199, 200, 201]"
"5.1 “Clause Conjugation” and “Sentence Conjugation”The smallest unit which represents a complete predication in Old Nobiin consists
of a subject marked as genitive and a predicate which is either a participle or the
subjunctive. As it is attested only as a subordinate clause Browne (1982:11)
called it clause conjugation. He represented its components as follows:
clause conjugation:                    subject                             predicate
                                       noun                                participle
                                                          + -n(a)
                                       pronoun                             subjunctive
 Participle and subjunctive are verbal nouns. The subjunctive is formed by suffix-
 ing personal endings to the different participles. Thus, it overtly expresses person
and number in contrast to the participle. Application of various phonological
rules generates the different endings presented in chapters 6.1 and 6.2. Unless the
subject of the participle is identical to the one of the main clause or to be taken
 from the context it has to be expressed. The subjunctive must be used if the sub-
ject is not evident.
    Browne (ibid.) analyzed the Old Nobiin verbal syntax on the basis of different
elements suffixed to the predicates of the “clause conjugation”. These elements
are the so-called “postpositions of conversion to sentence status” or “sentence
converters”. They help to convert a “clause conjugation” into a “sentence conju-
gation”. He distinguished between the “primary sentence conjugation” which is
                                                                                                     65
formed directly from the “clause conjugation” and the “secondary sentence con-
jugation”, which is built upon the “primary sentence conjugation”.
   The most important formant of the “primary sentence conjugation” is predica-
tive -a, which can also mark nominal predicates. If -a is suffixed to a participle,
the so-called predicative emerges. Again, person and number are not morpho-
logically marked. The subject must be expressed and marked as such if              it is a
noun and cannot be understood within the context. If the predicative -a is suf-
fixed to the endings of the subjunctive the indicative emerges which also has
person and number suffixes. A nominal subject has to be marked by the suffix
-(i)I. One of the periphrastic constructions, the so-called periphrastic predicative,
also belongs here.
    The origin of the different constructions of the “primary sentence conjuga-
tion” can be represented as follows:
subject             predicate
                    subjunctive                         indicative
noun      -|
pronoun                                  +-a=
                    participle                          predicative
                    participle           + -in=         periphrastic predicative
What Browne (ibid.) called “secondary sentence conjugation” emerges by suffix-
ing certain elements to the indicative or predicative. Most of these constructions
belong to the periphrastic constructions or the copulative. The most common of
the former are the “predicative periphrastic” and the “indicative periphrastic”
which are formed by combining a predicative or indicative with the verb -in ‘to
be’ or an equivalent (see in detail below chapter 9). The periphrastic indicative
seems to have an emphatic function whereas the periphrastic predicative is inter-
 preted as a stylistic variant of the non-periphrastic constructions.
      Another construction based on the predicative is the “predicative copulative”
 which represents one of the more uncommon         formations. The element -7(a) is
 documented as a copula with an antecedent noun in the predicative. It is also
 found with verbs in the indicative, a construction which Browne (ibid.) called
 “indicative copulative”, and which seems to focus the verb. A final formation
 based on the indicative is the “‘copulative with -me”, which is also present with
 nouns and pronouns in the predicative. Its function has yet to be described. Zyh-
 larz (1928:102) called -me “affirmative copula”. The most important construc-
 tions of the “secondary sentence conjugation” can be presented as follows:
 66
subject            predicate
                   indicative    {   + -m(a)       = _ indicative copulative
                                     +-me          = _ copulative in -me
noun -I            indicative                      = __ periphrastic indicative
pronoun                              + -in
                   predicative       et sim.       = __ periphrastic predicative
                   predicative       +-le          = __ predicative copulative
                                     + -(I/as)ke
A detailed discussion of the different tense/aspect forms will be presented in the
following chapters.","[65, 66, 67]"
"
 3.2.1 Subjective Traditionally, -/ was interpreted as definite article (Zylahrz                  1928:34; Werner
 1987:83). As early as 1975, Hintze demonstrated that -(i)/ marks the subject of a
 verbal or nominal sentence. The suffix is not used with pronouns or proper
 names. In some phonological environment, -/ is deleted (i. e. sal- ‘word’, for sal-l,
 Browne 2002:33). Examples are
  (IT HI 55 i 1)

chosen for stylistic reasons.

2.6 Old Nobiin Alphabet and PhonologyIt is not known how the speaker of Old Nobiin named the letters of their alphabet
and where the Meroitic signs were positioned. As Old Nobiin is only docu-
mented in its written form we can only approximate the phonetic value and pro-
nunciation of the signs. The following chart presents the letters of the alphabet
and their transcription in this book which corresponds to the presumed phonetic
value the signs represent:
     letter    transcription                 letter   transcription

       T             P
The letters presumably derived from Meroitic are F, P and 3.
   Besides its system of five vowels, Old Nobiin had several diphthong pho-
nemes which were /ai/, /aw/, /ew/, /iu/, and /oi/ which are still present in the mod-
ern variant. Old Nobiin occasionally marked vowel length in its orthography, but
there is no minimal pair with length as a distinctive feature. Furthermore, in
words which have a long vowel in Modern Nobiin vowel length alternates in the
Old Nobiin orthography, as in gar-/gaar- ‘shore, side’ or nog-/noog- ‘house’.
Vocalic alternations are a characteristic feature of Old and Modern Nobiin and
include frequent variation between a and e, e and i, o and i, and sometimes o and
u. Whether all of these are dialectal in origin as Werner (1987:46) and Browne
(2002:15) proposed is difficult to decide.
  Old and Modern Nobiin are rather similar with regard to their phonology, but
some interesting features and important changes have to be discussed here. If we
                                                                                   27
take a look at the distribution of nasals in Old Nobiin we find 7 restricted to
medial and final position, m and y to initial and medial position, and 2 to medial
position. In Modern Nobiin, the velar nasal is only word medial or final. In most
of the words with initial 7 we find 1 in present day Nobiin, as e. g. in
Old Nobiin         Modern Nobiin
nal-               nal-             ‘to see’
n0(0)k-            noog-            “house’In some words, however, initial g replaces the velar nasal:
nar-               gaar-             ‘to keep, hold’
nal-               ga(r)-            ‘son’
nol-               gol()-            ‘to gulp down’This discrepancy might be either due to dialectal variation within Nobiin or the
result of language contact.
    Zyhlarz (1928:9) was the first to discuss the phonetic nature of Old Nobiin A
which is supposed to represent and is normally transcribed as d. Already in Old
Nobiin, however, there are some examples of alternation between A and P /r/,
 e. g. in
ar-/ad-             ‘to seize’
oar-/oade-          ‘night’
~oro/-odo           ‘before’ It was therefore proposed that P originally might have represented some sort of
 retroflex sound. The situation in Modern Nobiin supports this hypothesis insofar,
 as we find alternating correspondences to Old Nobiin A in medial and final posi-
 tion (r is not found word initial). Although A is represented by d in most of the
 words, examples for corresponding r are documented in:
 Old Nobiin         Modern Nobiin
 nod                nor               ‘Lord’
 node               nore              ‘termite’
 tid-               tir-              ‘to encounter, meet’
 mid-               mir-              ‘run’ The most significant and obvious regular sound change in the system of conso-
 nant phonemes is the one of Old Nobiin p to Moder Nobiin fin word initial and
 final position, as in                                 ‘ Old Nobiin         Modern Nobiin
 pag-               fag-              ‘share’
 pal-               fal-              “to come out’

dapp-                daff-                “to perish’
dipp-                diffi-               “town, city’Although exceptions are documented, f doesn’t belong to the system of conso-
nant phonemes of Old Nobiin. In one of the Qasr Ibrim texts (IT II 16 iv 5), we
find a first instance of fi- ‘to be’ otherwise always documented as pi-.
    There are some exceptions to this otherwise regular sound change, e. g.
Old Nobiin           Modern Nobiin
ap(p)-               aab-                 “to grasp”
kap-                 kab-                 ‘to eat’In these instances, -p- was presumably not regarded as word final, because suf-
fixes had to be attached. In medial position, however, the regular correspondence
to Old Nobiin p is 5, as in
Old Nobiin           Modern Nobiin
ipol                 iboo                 ‘your father’
kumpu                kumbo                ‘egg’
torpar               torbar               ‘farmer’
tipit                tibit                ‘wave’To a certain extent, consonantal variation occurs which is probably due to dialec-
tal variation within Old Nobiin. These variations can be observed           between
voiced and voiceless consonants, as between g and k. In Old Nobiin, for exam-
ple, ak- and ag- ‘to sit’ alternate in the texts. This alternation is lost in Modern
Nobiin where only ag- is found.
    Ever since Herman Bell’s article from 1968 we know that Nobiin is a tone
language. Tone was, however, not marked in the orthography of Old Nobiin, and
we don’t know anything about its tonal structure and changes in tone from Old to
Modern Nobiin. Therefore, tone is not marked in any of the Nubian examples in
this book.
   Old Nobiin had a system of supraliteration with marks derived from Coptic.
Thus, a vowel forming a syllable is regularly marked by a horizontal stroke. If
the vowel is i, it bears diaeresis, e. g.
‘APOY     ‘rain’
ai        “|The vowel / is often not written, but marked by a horizontal stroke over the fol-
lowing consonant, occasionally the stroke implies the insertion of i before and
after the consonant, e. g.
TRA-      instead of TIAA-      “god”
CKT-      instead
              of ICKIT-       — ‘earth’
                                                                                  29
pert
       Finally, Old Nobiin also had its system of punctuation which also followed
       Greek practice. A raised point was regularly used to mark the end of a sentence,
       clause and colon. Other marks are sometimes employed to mark a question, the
       end of a section of text or a verse. In addition, most of the scribes left spaces be-
       tween words. For details of punctuation and supraliteration Browne (1981:55-61)
       should be consulted.","[26, 27, 28, 29, 30]"

       This was discovered by Griffith when he worked on Meroitic and Old Nubian. Lately, it has
       repeatedly been discussed whether a Meroitic origin of Old Nubian characters is plausible, not
       least because the Nubian characters seem to represent phonemes different from Meroitic. This ar-
       gument, however, is not convincing as the characters might represent the spoken Meroitic of the
       time Old Nubian was put into writing.

      Although Greek was introduced to Nubia during the 26th dynasty and later by
    the Ptolemies, its use intensified after the Roman conquest of Egypt, when
    northern Nubia became an extension of Roman Egypt—at least from the Roman
    point of view. The Romans replaced Egyptian with Greek as the official language
    of administration and law.‘ There were also Nubians who took the opportunity to
    climb the social ladder to become part of the Roman establishment. A Nubian
    named Paccius Maximus obviously received a Greek education and composed
    Greek poetry which was inscribed on the walls of local temples. There are some
    findings which suggest that Greek was taught at Meroe itself (Burstein 2006).
      The development of Greek as a lingua franca is closely related to the introduc-
    tion of Christianity which started in the Sth century AD. At the same time, Greek
    became one of the written languages of “international” or diplomatic communi-
    cation between peoples of different linguistic background. A letter written by a
king of the Blemmyes (Beja) to a Nubian king dated to the 5th century is evi-
dence of this development (Skeat 1977; Plumley 1982). Relating to the language
of this letter, Hagg (1982:105) speaks of “Pidgin Greek, in the strict sense of the
term, that is, a means of communication between two parties, neither of whom
used Greek as his native tongue, and with the grammatical structure partly bro-
ken down”. Numerous inscriptions and graffiti show a Nubian-Greek bilingual-
    ism which exhibits some sort of “mixture” of the two languages. Jakobielski
(1972:14) speaks of “mixed texts [...] which—with fundamentally Old Nubian
structure—preserve some Greek words together with articles or Greek texts with
numerous orthographical and grammatical errors”.
   This, however, is not the whole story. Greek in Nubia was by no means a pid-
gin language, although we have to speak of a genuine Nubian variant. The Chris-
tian Middle Ages were the heyday of Nubian Greek and the language was one of
the official languages of government and religion. Political terminology was
borrowed from Greek and books were written in the language. Greek inscriptions
and graffiti as well as the remains of a library were found at Qasr Ibrim and it
has to be assumed that this was not the only place in Medieval Nubia where an
abundance of written material was archived. Scratched on the walls of churches
innumerable graffiti were preserved, as many as 650 in one church. Many of
these short texts were written in the first person. Hundreds of funerary stelae
with Greek inscriptions have been found all over Nubia.® As Burstein (2006) has
pointed out, variations between the texts on the stelae attest to the linguistic
competence of the Nubians who not simply copied empty formulae but modified
4     A good summary of the use of Greek in Nubia can be found in Burstein (2006).

"4.4 Interrogative PronounsOne of the basic interrogative pronouns of Old Nobiin still preserved in the mod-
ern language is

na(ie)i             Naay, PL naay-gu             ‘who?’There are only few examples of ya(ie) in the known Old Nobiin texts. One of
these shows that the pronoun could take the object marker:

"Although in this sentence -j- could be interpreted as an intensifier, Abel explains
the context as repetitive, i. e. plurality of action is supposed to be indicated. In
his notes, he therefore translates ‘every time the boy does something wrong’. The
use of the phrase nahar-ee-ka ‘one day’, however, contradicts Abel’s translation.
   Plurality of subjects seems to be indicated in the next example:
(Erm. 131)
belel-le   ju-a           masani        oogr-ana-iye                  oogr-ek-kac-e-isan-goni    —_(-c- instead of -j-)
village-in go-ADJ         good          _call-IMPERPL-(they said]     call-take-come-PL-3PLPRET-and
sultani    iiga-tir-oon
sultan     say-BEN-3SGPRET““go into the village, good, call (him)”, and when they fetched and brought him, the sultan said to
him’Abel compares the use of -/- (here as voiceless -c-) in this example with a corre-
sponding passage in Lepsius’ translation of the gospel where we find another
example for marking of the plurality of subject:
(GM 7, 32)
tal-log    mumur       necj    wee-kaa_ekkac-c-isan                            (-c- instead of -j-)
he-to      mute        deaf    one-OB)        take-come-PL-3PLPRET
‘They brought to him a deaf-mute.’It can be summarized that the suffix -/- asserted its position as marker of plural-
ity, either of subject, object or action—the last one additionally having developed                                                                                                                       117
into an intensifier—over the course of the centuries without any indication of
erosion or a tendency towards loss.","[117, 118]"

 13. Appendix: Nubia in the Medieval Millennium —
        the Written Sources
 The Nubian Nile Valley is a region where intensive archaeological research has
 been undertaken which is comparable only to its northern neighbor Egypt. Colin
  Renfrew pointed out that these archaeological investigations also opened up new
 possibilities for linguistic studies: “[...] while we cannot expect to find direct
 evidence in the archaeological record for a specific prehistoric language or lan-
 guage group, we can indeed study processes of demographic and social change
 which we may seek, however hypothetically, to correlate with language change
 in those areas” (1987:264).
      In the 6th century AD, the Christian historiographers began to write about the
 northern Sudan. At first, their main subject was the conversion of Nubia to Chris-
 tianity, later, they were interested in the unique phenomenon of a stable Christian
 kingdom in the immediate neighborhood of Muslim Egypt. When the Muslim
 historiographers and geographers began to write about the region not much later
 they provided an abundance of information about geography, history, politics and
 economy in the northern Sudan. In spite of the many Arab sources, however,
 they conveyed only fragments about the political and social situation in Nubia
 between the 9th and 15th century. For many scholars, the sources seemed, for
example, to prove that Christianity in Nubia and with it the Nubian kingdom
came to an end when the capital Dongola was conquered in 1323. As it is now
known, the kingdom of Dotawo, which is not mentioned in Arab sources, existec
at least until the end of the 15th century.
     In the course of excavations at Qasr Ibrim, numerous Old Nobiin documents
have been found and edited which constitute the basis for the linguistic analyses
of Old Nobiin in this book. Although we are able to translate most of the written
remains, our knowledge of the context is often too inadequate to actually under-
stand what the texts talk about. Adams (1996:244) states: “For the time being
they [the texts] may be said to enrich our picture of mediaeval Nubian life with-
out significantly clarifying it, inasmuch as they raise perhaps as many questions
as they answer.” One of the problems Adams and others seem to find difficult to
deal with stems from the discrepancies between the content of Old Nobiin and
other   written   sources.   These   discrepancies,   however,   are   only   problematic    as                                                                                            219
long as the different sources are taken as reflection of one or more historical
realities. This seems to be the major fallacy of most of the historical work deal-
ing with ancient Nubia.
   1 do not share this rather pessimistic attitude towards the texts and will there-
fore try to evaluate and interpret them with regards to their content. This will be
done against the background of non-Nubian written sources.","[218, 219, 220]"

 13.4 The Kingdom of DotawoAs has been mentioned above, a Lower Nubian kingdom existed until the end of
the 15th century which was called Dotawo. At the beginning, scientific research
proceeded on the assumption that Dotawo was a kind of successor state founded
after the Arab occupation of Dongola. The written evidence found at Qasr Ibrim,
however, documents the name Dotawo in a royal proclamation as early as 1156
(Browne 1991:3). Other references date from the 12t to the 14th centuries, and
after a gap of more than one hundred years, the final reference mentions a king
of Dotawo in 1464 (Plumley 1978). Against this background, it seems remark-
able that the Arab writers not once mention Dotawo in their accounts of Nubian
history.
    This lack of written evidence gave cause for different speculations concerning
the position and significance of Dotawo in the context of Medieval Nubia. The
discussion concentrated on two rather different assumptions:
 1. Dotawo was a petty kingdom within Nobatia but was subordinate to dominat-
   ing Makuria.
2. Dotawo is the Nubian name for the kingdom of Makuria mentioned in Arab
   sources,
On the basis of the written sources, it can be stated that Dotawo’s main language
was Old Nobiin. The name itself has been interpreted as consisting of a toponym
Do and the postposition fawo ‘below’. Do was equated with modern Adda and
Daw of Arab sources. Thus, Dotawo is supposed to mean ‘(the country) below
Do’ (Adams 1977:535; Vantini 1981:199). This etymology is based on the as-
sumptions that Dotawo’s status actually was one of a petty kingdom and that its
capital was Adda. Sudanese archaeologist Ali Osman (1982:194) proposed an
alternative etymology of the name. He interprets it as a compound noun consist-
ing of doro ‘above (= south)’ and tawo ‘below (= north)’ and equates Dotawo
with Makuria and Nobatia/Makuria of Arab sources respectively.
   The discussion about the identity of Dotawo is exemplary for the sometimes
uncritical approach to historical sources concerning Nubia. Although historians
like Adams noticed the discrepancies in the sources of different origin no conclu-
sion was drawn, obviously because alternative interpretations would not have
fitted the traditional reconstruction of historical processes.
  One important argument for the equation of Dotawo and Makuria lies in the
fact that the two designations are never mentioned together in one text and Ma-
kuria is only mentioned once within the whole corpus of Old Nobiin Qasr Ibrim
texts. In contrast, Dotawo is not mentioned once in more than 120 Arabic sources                                                                               227
about medieval Nubia (Adams       1991:259). Although Adams    (1996:244) recog-
nizes this astonishing fact he continues to point out that the Qasr Ibrim docu-
ments contain as much evidence for as against the equation of Dotawo and Ma-
kuria.
    It has become quite obvious that Nobiin and Arabic names for places as well
as political entities often do not coincide. Only recently, it has been recognized
that Nobadia/Nobatia was called mig- or migitin gul- (gul- ‘territory’) in Old
Nobiin. The Arabic designation /brim is documented in the Coptic variant Phrim
and Greek Primis. But the Old Nobiin name for the place is Silimi which might
go back to Meroitic.
    The main argument presented against an equation of Dotawo and Makuria is
based on the names of the kings given in the texts. Between 1155 and 1191,
Moses George, George     Moses,   Moses and George are mentioned      as kings of
Dotawo in Nubian sources. It is dubious whether these names refer to one or
more persons. At the same time, George and Moses are known as kings in Don-
gola (Adams 1991, 1996; Vantini 1975). At first sight, this argues for the equa-
tion of Dotawo and Makuria. A hundred years later, however, Piarl (or Paul),
George Simon and Siti are mentioned as kings of Dotawo (Plumley 1978:235),
whereas the rulers in Dongola are Shekenda, Barak, Shemamun and Abi Abdal-
lah Kanz al-Dawla (Adams, ibid.).
   Again, this argumentation doesn’t consider that the different names come
from different sources. On the one hand we have the names found in the Nubian
sources, on the other hand we have the Arab sources such as al-Maqrizi who had
never been to Nubia, wrote about events which happened about a century before,
and who was a great compiler of different sources often not accurately quoted by
him.
    One has to bear in mind that by the end of the 13th century when the Arab au-
 hors resume their writing about Nubia, they describe a region in turmoil. The
reasons behind this instable political situation are neither revealed by Arab nor
by Nubian sources. The Arab sources, however, mention a king Dawid of Nubia
who had forcefully deposed his predecessor. Dawid is also the name of Piarl or
Paul of Dotawo’s predecessor. Piarl/Paul ruled around the year 1281 so that his
predecessor could have ruled in the seventies of the 13h century (comp. Plumley
 1978:234) when king Dawid of the Arab sources held the throne in Dongola. It
can therefore be assumed that the two Dawids were actually one person called
king of Dotawo in Nubian and King of Dongola in Arab sources.
   The different sources indicate that after Dawid’s deposition in 1276/77, the
Nubian unity fell apart. In Dongola, Shekenda succeeded to the throne in
1276/77 and swore by the Mameluke sultan “to bring to the Sultan all the private
property, goods and cattle, which belonged to Dawid” (Magqrizi in: Vantini228
 1975:650). He was murdered shortly after and replaced by Barak. In 1279, She-
 mamun (or Simamun) came to the throne and ruled until the nineties of the
 13th century. Two dated texts from Qasr Ibrim show that at the same time the
 kings of Dotawo were not identical to the above-mentioned kings: In 1281, the
 king of Dotawo is called Piarl or Paul, in 1287 Georgiu Simon. For the next
 decades, Arab sources mention Ammy,       Kerenbes and Barshambu as kings of
Dongola. In 1323, the Kanz ed-Dawla finally succeeded to the throne in Don-
gola, whereas at the same time Siti ruled in Dotawo.
    The Nobiin sources do not indicate that anything was out of order in the king-
dom. Although it is known that changes happened and that at some point Don-
gola lost its status as capital and had become the seat of vassal kings of the Ma-
meluke rulers of Egypt is far from clear how these changes came about.
   Evidently, it is the Arab discourse which constructs an empire on the verge of
disintegration. It might be speculated that this constitutes a kind of legitimizing
discourse for the coming into power of a new Arabic speaking elite in Nubia.
Whether all or some of the alleged kings mentioned in Arab sources actually
existed is unproven. Until now, no one seems to have wondered about the rather
untypical names Shekanda, Kerenbes and Barshambu who don’t seem to be of
Nobiin origin.
   It can therefore be concluded that Dotawo is in fact the Nobiin name of the
kingdom of Makuria, also known as Kingdom of Dongola, Nubia or Nobatia and
Makuria in Arab sources. The name was retained when the capital moved to the
north. This reconstruction resolves some of the discrepancies in the traditional
interpretation of the relationship between Dotawo and Makuria. Adams
(1991:261) wonders that the office of the Eparch (see below) who was tradition-
ally appointed by the king of Makuria survived into the 15th century although
since 1365 at the latest, the king no longer resided in Makuria. If we proceed on
the assumption that the two, Dotawo and Makuria, were identical, it is conse-
quential that the important office of the Eparch survived even in the much
smaller kingdom of the north.
   The equation of the two also solves the problem of the lack of written evi-
dence in Arab sources. These usually don’t bother with self-designations. Only
through Old Nobiin sources we now know about the self-designation for the
northern region.","[226, 227, 228, 229]"

3.4 Formation of NounsOld Nobiin had a rich inventory of noun formation suffixes some of which will
be presented and discussed below. Of interest will be those still found in Modern
Nobiin either as productive elements or lexicalized.
   A well documented suffix forming abstract and concrete nouns from verbs is
-at(t)-      as in
tapp-att-            ‘destruction’      from    tapir-        ‘to destroy’
seu-att-             ‘heir’             from    seu-          ‘to inherit’The element is preserved as -afti in Modern              Nobiin. According to Werner
 (1987:91) and Lepsius (1880:29), -atti marks a person, but has a negative conno-
 tation in most of the cases, as in
 banp-atti           *babbler’          from    banp-         ‘to speak’
 di-atti             ‘murderer’         from    di-           ‘to die’
 mark-atti           ‘thief?            from    mark-         ‘to steal, to rob’The negative connotation doesn’t correspond to the Old Nobiin examples. There,
however, we find the denominative and deverbative agent formant -katti which
 produces comparable nouns, such as48
uk-katt-/ur-katt-       ‘oppressor, enemy’       from      ur           “to (op)press’”
nape-katt               ‘sinner’                 from     nape          ‘sin’The last example is also listed by Lepsius (1880:367) as
nabce-gatti             ‘sinner’Another similar derivation with a negative connotation in Modern Nobiin is
marja-gatti             ‘liar’                   from      marja        ‘lie, wrong’Old Nobiin -Xatt- is not restricted to pejorative contexts as other examples show.
The same holds true for Modern Nobiin. Both Lepsius and Wemer noted words
ending in -atti in the vocabularies which do not fall in this semantic category, but
are not accounted for. Examples are
fag-atti                ‘half?                   from      fag-         ‘to divide’
till-atti               ‘sweat’                  from      till-        ‘to sweat”
unn-atti                ‘progeny’                from      unn-         ‘to bear, to give birth to”Old Nobiin pak-katt- ‘share, half? from pag- ‘to share’ shows that an original
-katti might have been reduced in these examples. unnatti is not documented in
Old Nobiin, and (ilatti is only found in a doubtful instance in IT III 39.24 where
Browne (1996:171) tentatively translates ‘bosom’.
   To further complicate the situation unnee-gatti ‘wise man’ from unnee ‘under-
Standing, thoughts’ has to be cited which was documented by Lepsius
(1880:406).           This de-nominal        derivation   corresponds   to Old      Nobiin     une-katt-
‘wise’ from une- ‘understanding’. There is no evidence that -gatti is productive
in Modern Nobiin and seems to be present only in lexicalized from.
    Another suffix in the context of word formation which is present in Old No-
biin and still productive in the modern variant is the denominative and deverbal
abstract noun formant
-itt-         as in
aru-itt-                ‘irrigation’             from     aru-          ‘rain’
iskel-itt-              “request, prayer’        from     iskel-        “to beg’Werner (1987:87) lists ewitti- ‘field work’, fayitti ‘scripture’, and uwitti ‘second’
as examples for the productive suffix in Modern Nobiin. The last two are inter-
esting because the corresponding words in Old Nobiin look quite different. Mod-
ern Nobiin faay- ‘to write’ corresponds to Old Nobiin par-. The phonological
changes are regular ones. Instead of the deverbal noun *paritti- ‘scripture’, how-
ever, pa(a)rt- and pait- ‘scripture, writing’ are found in the Old Nobiin texts. Of
quite a different nature is the example of wwitti ‘second’ from uwwo ‘two’. In
Modern Nobiin, ordinals are regularly formed by suffixing -itti to the cardinals.
The only exception is wrragi ‘beginning, initially’ which is used as ordinal ‘first’
                                                                                                      49
instead of *weeritti from weer- ‘one’. Only some of the ordinals are preserved in
the old texts but we find formations with -ift(i) for ‘3d’ tuskit(t)-, ‘4’ kemsit()-
and ‘7th’ kolotit-. The corresponding number ww(wo) ‘two’ is present, but the
ordinal documented is wil- ‘second’. Only in one text, IT 1 11, we find circum-
stantial evidence for the existence of another form. In line 9, the ordinal ‘12!’ is
part of the expression dimedu witinin ‘it being the twelfth’. witi- corresponds to
modern wwitti ‘second’. In line 8 of the same text, wif- seems to be part of a
compound noun ‘two small feasts’. As these examples are singular the evidence
is not conclusive. The most convincing explanation of present-day uwitti- is as a
formation analogous to the other ordinals.
    A suffix which forms abstract nouns from verbs and nouns is
-k(i)-       as in
it-k-                  ‘mankind’               from   it-         ‘man’
tur-k                  ‘setting’               from   tor-        ‘to enter’-k(i)- is neither discussed nor recognized by Werner (1987) or Lepsius (1880).
 Lepsius’ Nobiin vocabulary, however, includes derivation as jag-ki ‘fear’ from
jag ‘to fear’, and Khalil (1990) also records a number of formations with the
suffix -k(i)-, as e. g.
afri-ki              ‘beauty’                  from   afri-       “beautiful”
gak-ki               ‘gap, crack, cleft’       from   gak-        ‘to rip, to crack, to break’
abinti-ki            ‘benignity, placidness’   from   abint       “benign, gentle, soft’Into the same category of abstract formation falls the suffix -kane- as in
aigajkane-             ‘exultation’            from   ai(l)gaj-   “to exult”
aiokkane-              ‘grudging*              from   aiol-       ‘to be grudging”
                                                                  (with assimilation of -l-)In ChN 6.20, one instance with geminated nasal is found
aik-kann-              ‘spirituality’          from   ail-        ‘heart, soul’Lepsius (1880:28ff.) describes a presumably corresponding suffix -kennee which
forms abstract nouns from verbs, nouns and adjectives, as in
assar-kennee            ‘childhood’            from   assar       ‘small, child’
mas-kennee              ‘the good’             from    mas        ‘good’
uus-kennee              ‘misdoing’             from    uus-       ‘bad, evil’
ed-kennee               ‘wedding’              from    ed-        “to take, to marry’The suffix -it is a general noun formant both from verbs and nouns. Although
Zyhlarz (1928:21) listed an -it suffix, he did not succeed in determining the ver-
bal origin of his examples. In his earlier works, Browne did not recognize the
50
       derivational morpheme. It is in the Qasr Ibrim texts that most of the nouns are
       found (Bechhaus-Gerst 1996:229). Examples are
       tisk-it          ‘destruction’           from   tisk-          ‘to destroy’
       unn-it           ‘birth’                 from   unn-           ‘to bear, to give birth’
       pisteu-it        ‘belicf”                from   pisteu-        ‘to believe’
       doll-it          ‘wish, desire’          from   doll-          ‘to wish’
       od-it            ‘illness’               from   od(d)-         ‘to be sick’
       tei-it           ‘hope’                  from   tei-           ‘to hope’
       kap-it           ‘loaf (of bread)’       from   kap-           “to eat’
       kit-it           “garment”               from   kit(ir)-       ‘to dress’       In one Old Nobiin text, Chrisostomus Nubianus, the derivation
       ag-id            ‘seat’                  from   ag-            ‘to sit’       is documented. This leads over to Modern Nobiin where the corresponding -iid/
       -id is the most productive suffix used to derive verbal nouns from all kinds of
       verbs. Examples can be found in Werner (1987:202) and Lepsius (1880:28).
       Khalil documents (1996:57) kap-id ‘round, thick loaf of bread’ which directly
       corresponds to Old Nobiin kap-it (see above).
          This unquestionable correspondence makes Browne’s (2002:27) equation of
       the suffixes -it and -t highly improbable. Old Nobiin -f- is another deverbal and
       denominal noun formant which is documented in examples as
       iar-t            ‘knowledge’             from   iar-           ‘to know’
       gut-t            ‘shame’                 from   gur-           ‘to be shameful’
                                                                      (with assimilation)
       dumart-          ‘power’                 from   dum(m)ar-      ‘to rule over, hold’       The modern correspondence is the suffix -¢i, Nouns with final -ti are frequent in
       present-day Nobiin        but it doesn’t seem to be a productive derivational suffix.
       Examples are
       nur-ti           ‘flour’                 from   nuur        ‘to thresh, to grind’
       jor-ti           ‘oath’                  from   jor         *to swear’       The suffix -; is presumably an allomorph of -é- after d, n, j, and yl, as Browne
       (2002:27) has pointed out. He cites the examples
       sonoj-j-         ‘office of the sonoj’
       an-j-       ;    ‘life, savior’          from   an-               ‘to live’       The last example is also listed by Khalil (1990:113) for Modern Nobiin:
       aan-ji           ‘life’                  from   an-             ‘to live’       Another suffix which forms abstract nouns from verbs and nouns is

and -ee with a long vowel. The latter is most probably a loan from Kenzi (Wer-
ner 1987:81). Examples from derivate nouns with short vowel -e are, e. g.
gug-e             ‘flatulence,        from       gug-          ‘to swell, to bloat’

 of language change. These formants will not be discussed here.","[48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"
"2.2 Old NobiinOld Nobiin was deciphered                in 1906 by Heinrich Schafer and Karl Schmidt, and
its scientific study started in 1913 when F. LI. Griffith published the then known
texts in his Nubian texts of the Christian period. From early on, it was evident
that the language was a predecessor of modern Nobiin and not of one of the other
Nubian languages of the Nile Valley, Kordofan or Darfur. There are, however,
some differences between Old and Modern Nobiin which cannot be explained by
language change but have presumably to be traced back to dialectal variation.
What we know as Old Nobiin might reflect one or more dialects or variants of
the language which have completely disappeared. As dialectal studies of modern
Nobiin have not yet been undertaken and the few grammatical and lexical studies
represent only part of the picture, the closest relative of Old Nobiin on the dialec-
tal level might simply have not yet been found. Another explanation might be
found in a development similar to for example the process in Germany in the
medieval period. It has been pointed out that early written German was some sort
of “mixed language” in terms of a mixing of elements from geographically and
temporally different origins.’ Old Nobiin is a very uniform language; only in
vocalic alternations we may find some dialectal variation.
    It is interesting to discuss why the Nubians wanted to put their language into
writing when they had already at their disposal Greek and Coptic and possibly
initially Meroitic too as written media of communication. They definitely wanted
to demonstrate their self-confidence as a kingdom which even outdared the Arab-
Egyptian attempts at invasion. The rise of Nobiin as a written language seems
also to have corresponded to the formation of a highly structured and authoritar-
ian political entity which covered different small kingdoms and other political
entities with people of different linguistic background. This “nation state” might
have been in need of a local language as a medium and symbol of demarcation
against the outside world. Written Nobiin possibly was an important component
of the construction of a Nubian empire in the succession of Meroe, as it, for
example, definitely stated its end.",[19]
"
 11.3.4 Causal ClausesIn Old Nobiin, several postpositional elements could be employed to construct cau-
sal clauses. (-lo)-joa, -lejoun/-lojun, jurro, -juria are all derived from _jur- ‘cause’.
    In the first example from the Menas legend, the main clause is in the impera-
tive and the causal clause has the tense/aspect/person marker of the preterit II
subjunctive followed by the subordinating conjunction. The subject of the causal
clause is the object of the main clause:
(M. 11.8-9)
ai-ka   aul-ose-e           nape-k     au-esi-lojun
I-OB)   save-DIR-IMPERSG    sin-OB)    do-lPRETIISUB-because (of)*,..save me because I have committed sin.”",[204]
"

8. “Old” Verbal Extensions
The verbal extensions discussed below are called “‘old”, because they are directly
attached to the verb they modify, and are neither constructed periphrastically (see
chapter 9) nor do they go back to the innovated verbal complexes (see chapter
10). Two of these extension, passive and causative, belong to the category of
voice, the third one is a marker of plurality, either of subjects, object or of ac-
tions.","[110, 111]"
"
 6.6 Interrogative There is no complete paradigm of the interrogative documented                         in Old Nobiin
 although we would expect a fully developed paradigm if we look at Modern
 Nobiin. According to Browne (2002:66), interrogative sentences can end in:
 “i         2™ person singular in all examples
 -ha        one example 1* person singular and 3™ person singular respectively The suffixes follow the verb/predicate and personal endings. The question can be
 introduced by an interrogative pronoun, such as is- or mina (for interrogative
 pronouns see 4.4). The terminal particle is optional and can be dropped.
 (M. 9.1)
 anki-min-na-i
 remember-NEG-2SGPRESIND-INTERROG
  ‘don’t you remember?’  An interrogative pronoun can be placed at the beginning of the sentence or
  clause, as in
  (NC 26.10-12)
  mina iru    till-ilogoian    —_ daui-na-i
  what you     god-than           be great-2SGPRESIND-INTERROG
  ‘what? are you greater than god?’
      100
Although the interrogative pronoun is there it is not a wh-type question but a
yes-no one. Second person singular -i seems to be part of a regular interrogative
paradigm which is still present in Modern Nobiin (see below). Suffix -ha, how-
ever, listed by Browne under the same heading is not part of that paradigm. In
the two instances documented, it follows interrogative pronouns, thus addition-
ally marking wh-type questions, as in
(M. 8.14-15)
islo     is-sna-ha

“where was it?’
(ITII 16iii 9-12)
iskaragra-ha [...]           pal-di-re
how-INTERROG [...]           go forth-FUT-ISGPRESIND
‘how will I go forth?’In Modern Nobiin we find two paradigms                               for the interrogative which   Werner
(1987:153) labels interrogative I and II. Interrogative I has a suffix -i for the
2nd person and seems to correspond to the Old Nobiin form. The suffixes of the
interrogative are:
                       Interrogative I Present                Interrogative I] Present

 10. Grammaticalization of Verbal Complexes
10.1 IntroductionThe loss of periphrastic constructions in the development from Old to Modern
Nobiin coincided with an increasing use of constructions involving so-called
adjunctive -a (see chapter 5.2). Zyhlarz (1928:111) was the first author who
recognized an additional function of predicative -a. It is used in so-called verbal
complexes of Old Nobiin. Verbal complexes are verb strings with two or more
verbs sharing a common subject where verbal morphology only occurs on the
last verb. The other verb(s) often take(s) predicative -a which, however, may be
elided. In accordance with Hintze (1975:16), the -a element in these formations
is called “adjunctive”, although it is presumably identical to the predicative. The
verbal complexes show many characteristic features of serial verb constructions,
but differ in that, for example, overt markers of coordination are possible. Al-
though the numerous authors dealing with serial verb constructions in the lan-
guages of the world do not always agree on what is absolutely necessary to de-
fine one, the absence of this kind of overt marking is listed by Aikhenvald
(2006:1): “A serial verb is a sequence of verbs which act together as a single
predicate, without any overt marker of coordination, subordination, or syntactic
dependency of any other sort.” In many instances, the different verbs constitute a
single predicate and the serial verb construction describes what is conceptualized
as a single event. Aikhenvald (2006:4ff.) lists the following typical formal and
semantic properties:
 1. Serial verb constructions act as single predicates.
2. Serial verb constructions are monoclausal and allow no markers of syntactic
  dependency on their components.
3. The verbs in a serial verb construction share tense/aspect, mood,     modality,
   and polarity value.
4. Serial verb constructions refer to one overall event.
Although, as some examples show, verbal complexes may have typical features
of serial verb construction, they more often seem to agree with what can be
called “clause chaining”. DeLancey (1991), who analyzed Tibeto-Burman Lhasa,                                                                                137
describes constructions which express sequences of events. One or more verb(s)
take(s) non-final affixes and is/are followed by a finite verb with tense/aspect/
mood affixes. Although most of the constructions analzyed by DeLancey refer to
multiple events, there are some verbs occurring as final and finite verbs which
combine with preceeding non-final verbs to express single events. The verb ‘go’
for example expresses distal directionality as final verb. In these constructions,
DeLancey argues, the last verbs became reanalyzed as aspect markers. Having
undergone this process they may occur with non-final markers. DeLancey speaks
of ‘serialized’ verbs in this context. It will be demonstrated below that similar
developments can be observed in Old Nobiin.
   In Old Nobiin, we find numerous instances of verbal complexes where at least
two verbs combine and function as single predicate, as in
(IT III 57 ii 1-2)
mani-kon           dok-on-j-eso
eyes-and           kiss-love-PLOBJ-IMPERSG
‘and (lovingly) kiss his eyes!’The two verbs of this complex are directly attached to each other without an
intervening element.                  Furthermore,   the construction     seems    to fulfil all of the
above criteria of verb serialization as does the next example from a release cer-
tificate for a former slave.
(IT III 33. 7-8)
aiu [...] yjopa             gra      nar-kaj-a-sin
 I         [...]   Nubian   like   keep-keep-PREDPRES-EMPH ‘I [...] keep (him) as a Nubian’ In most of the verbal complexes, however, the different verbs are marked by
 adjunctive -a. Furthermore, they need not to be contiguous and are occasionally
 coordinated by -on ‘and’ as the following examples show:
     (CRN 7.14-16)
     it-a        wel        tid-a-sin               wer-ildo            ak-a__—thalasu_uattto-ka

     consider-ADJ      see-come-PARTPRES-OB)
     ‘[...] it is a man, he encounters, sitting upon a mountain, considering looking coming at the whole
     sea.”","[135, 136, 137, 138]"
"
3.2.4 A Note on the -u SuffixThroughout this study nouns are occasionally cited ending in -u. Zyhlarz
(1928:31) and others regarded the ending as “appositive” or status appositivus,
an interpretation which Browne (2002:37) vehemently and correctly rejects. -u is
a phonologically conditioned juncture element which interchanges with -i. Both
are inserted between words or clauses that closely cohere, but are only required
when the first word ends in two consonants and are optional everywhere else.
The usage seems to have been dependent on the respective scribe.",[37]
"
                                                                                   103
-sin is employed as emphasizer and copulative, the latter being the primary us-
age.
   -sin puts a whole verbal clause or verbal sentence into focus. Repetition of
   the particle within the clause or sentence is common but not obligatory.
   It also functions as focus marker in nominal sentences.                    ;
   With -appa ‘for’, the particle is obligatory and it may serve as a copulative
   with a preceding noun.
   -sin regularly has a causal implication, whether it is repeated      in the same
   sentence or not. The causal implication has to be inferred from context. The
   basic function remains that of a copulative.
   Suffixed to a noun in the predicative, -sin marks the antecedent of a relative
    clause.
The different functions of the so-called emphatic particles in Old Nobiin outlined
above might explain why so many sentences and clauses with -sin and even more
so with -/o are found in the texts and in the examples given in this study. In spite
 of these numerous examples from Old Nobiin, the two emphatic particles obvi-
 ously have disappeared in Modern Nobiin. The evidence is insufficient to finally
 decide on the matter but Khalil (1996) is the only one who cites in his dictionary
 of Modern Nobiin a suffix -sen with the presumed meaning of ‘yes, certainly,
 sure’ which presumably corresponds to ‘Old Nobiin’ -sin as the translation sug-
 gests an emphatic connotation.","[103, 104]"
"

                          The initial vowel as well as -r- may be dropped. The predicative preterit II would
                          have been -isira, but is not documented. There is a preterit II form -isa which is
                          only used in attributive constructions (Browne 2002:50).
                                 Besides the indicative, the predicative can occur in a verbal sentence. As per-
                          son and number are not marked with predicative forms, it can only be used if the
                          subject is expressed or understood within the context. Examples are innumerable
                          in the religious as well as documentary texts. Some of them are presented below:                          Predicative Present

EEEEEEeEeEeEaEEeEVw~Es~
                          In Modern Nobiin, some remnants of the formerly widespread predicative -a are
                          found. In a nominal sentence, the noun which functions as predicate is still
                          marked by -a, but it is followed by men- ‘to be’ marked for tense/aspect and
                                                                                                                                        69

person. This construction corresponds to the one from Old Nobiin mentioned
above under 3. ‘nominal predicate + in- ‘to be”. Only in the 3""4 person singular,
the verb can optionally be dropped (Werner 1987:203). The resulting construc-
tions resemble to the nominal sentence of Old Nobiin:

‘this is a man’ (ibid.)In Abel’s Ermenne narrative and the gospel according to Mark, we find examples
of the construction with men-:

 the 3d person singular, as the following example shows:

The predicative as one of the verbal forms in a verbal sentence has completely
disappeared. In connection with verbs, only the adjunctival function of -a was
preserved. In this function, it is still found in verb strings or verbal complexes
where it is suffixed to all but the last verb which takes the tense/aspect and per-
son markers,Excurse 1: Indicative and SubjunctiveIt has been mentioned before that Old Nobiin had indicative as well as sub-
junctive forms. Indicative and subjunctive are rather traditional labels which
might no longer be generally understood in the sense they were used within the
framework of Old Nobiin grammar. Therefore, some explanations seem neces-
sary, as—to hopefully simplify matters—this distinction is maintained in this
book. As presumably generally known, indicative and subjunctive belong to the
grammatical    category of mood.    Palmer (2006?:5) discusses the difference be-
tween indicative/subjunctive on the one hand and realis/irrrealis on the other
hand. Although both may express the distinction between the notional features of
realis and irrrealis, there are differences in their distribution and syntactic func-
tion. A characteristic feature of the subjunctive is that it is found mainly in sub-
ordinate clauses. Palmer furthermore mentions that the indicative/subjunctive
system usually occurs with the tense systems, a feature which does not apply to
the realis/irrealis system. He discusses a wide range of different subordinate o
complement clauses which are marked by the subjunctive in various language:
of the world (ibid., 107-144). Most of his categories have, however, no relevance
for the use of the subjunctive in Old Nobiin.
   Jespersen (1924:314) noted that the subjunctive may simply have the function
of being subordinate and therefore is typically the mood used in subordinate
clauses. Palmer (ibid., 142ff.) agrees with Jespersen’s assumptions and stresses
that the subjunctive sometimes lacks any motivation of irrealis. He gives exam-
ples from Latin where the use of the subjunctive increasingly concentrated on
marking subordination in general or to distinguish between different kinds of
subordinate clauses.
    With regard to Old Nobiin, the first grammar by Zyhlarz (1928:59) distin-
guished   between   an   emphatic/finite   and   a subjunctive/infinite   conjunction.
Browne (1982 and more) replaces emphatic with indicative but otherwise agrees
with Zyhlarz’ general interpretation of the verbal system. Both authors regard the
subjunctive as one of the forms of the verb in subordinate clauses, the other one
being the participle. Browne’s thorough analyses has shown that both forms are                                                                                    71
verbal nouns distinguished by the overt expression of person and number in the
subjunctive which       is missing with the participle. Although     in some        instances
irrealis features might be involved, they are by no means predominant or even
important. First and foremost, the subjunctive in Old Nobiin is a subordinator
used in all kinds of complement clauses without any notion of irrealis, the main
factor being the necessity to express person and number.                       .
   Correspondingly, the term indicative refers to the form of the verb in main
clauses if person and number have to be expressed. Otherwise, parallel to the
participle in complement clauses, the predicative is used in main clauses.
   All authors writing on Modern Nobiin also dealt with the question of the exis-
tence of a subjunctive in the language. Lepsius and Reinisch who had no knowl-
edge of Old Nobiin came to different conclusions. Reinisch (1879:82) lists a
paradigm for the subjunctive in Modern Nobiin which mainly differs from the
indicative in the absence of the innovated second person singular and plural (see
below chapter 6.1). There are, however, no convincing examples in his texts.
Lepsius obviously wasn’t aware of a subjunctive in Nobiin and ignores it com-
pletely. In his comment on Reinisch’s grammar (1880:477) he points to the fact
that no examples are given and that his informants are ignorant of the forms.
Eighty years later, Abel (1921:3) describes the old subjunctive of Nobiin as about
to disappear. Another sixty years later, Werner (1987:192) recorded the remains
of a subjunctive paradigm which only shows up when followed by the postposi-
 tion -faan ‘until’. It is no longer productive and the comparison with Abel’s
 paradigm reveals that in the 2nd and 3% person singular, the personal endings
 were either lost and replaced by the suffix of the Infinitive -e, as Werner (ibid.)
 suggests, or simply reduced from -en to -e. Neither in the singular nor in the

 with Abel’s paradigm of the subjunctive is that it looks like the indicative minus
 the innovated 2""4 persons. That there actually are remnants of the old subjunctive
 in Modern Nobiin is most obvious in Wemer’s 1st person singular and 1st and
 2d person plural where even the ambiguous forms of the Old Nobiin subjunctive
 are preserved. If the attempt at reconstructing the innovated personal endings is
 72
at least partly correct (see below) it is consistent that they are missing in the
subjunctive. The indicative copulative -m(a) never follows a verb in the subjunc-
tive in Old Nobiin (see chapter 9.5). A much simpler explanation would argue
with the status of the subjunctive as disappearing as a productive paradigm at the
time of the innovation of the 2     person ending which was only preserved      in
fixed paradigms like the so-called ‘subjunctive with -faan’.
   To summarize these excursive remarks it can be emphasized that the terms in-
dicative/subjunctive are maintained in this book basically referring to morpho-
logically distinct verb forms in Old Nobiin found in main and subordinate/com-
plement clauses. How these combine with various tense/aspect constructions will
be discussed in the respective chapters. In Modern Nobiin, the morphologically
marked distinction is lost, but looking at the endings (see below) it is far from
obvious whether these represent reduced endings of the old indicative or whether
the old subjunctive was generalized and also used instead of the original forms.
Definitely, predicative -a, which was characteristic of Old Nobiin indicative, is
missing in Modern Nobiin.","[68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73]"

In the next example from the Nicene Canons, we find a verbal complex in the
causal clause, doll-a mone-sin-nejun ‘because he loved and hated’, marked as
preterit II subjunctive. In contrast, the main clause has the suffix of the fu-
ture/intentional. The subject of the main clause is identical to the subject of the
causal clause:

‘and god will take away his share in the tree of life, because he loved the earthly and hated the heav-
enly’The initial subjunctive of the next sentence functions as a conditional protasis.
The causal clause exhibits an embedded relative clause with the verb marked as
preterit I participle, the main clause is only implicitly present.

‘if he cursed the chest, (it is) because a heart existed in it which was desiring evil’Remnants of this construction seem to be preserved in Modem Nobiin. Khalil
(1996:133) is the only author who lists jur ‘cause, reason’ as preserved today.
Werner (1987:359) documents jooro ‘because of’ in his word list which follows
the genitive as it did in Old Nobiin. Khalil distinguishes jooro from the postposi-
tion dooro ‘above’ presumably originating in Old Nobiin -do ‘upon, over’ (ibid.,
38). Lepsius (1880:289) as well as Reinisch (1879:129) list -do(o)ro as local and
causal postposition indicating a merger of two elements from Old to Modern
Nobiin with some variations left. This might explain why Werner has iniin jooro
‘therefore’ with the literal meaning of ‘because of this’ whereas Reinisch (ibid.)
cites inin doro with the same meaning. -jooro/-dooro seems to be restricted to
nominal clauses.
   Regularly, however, siballa ‘because of? from Arabic sibab ‘cause’ and Nobiin
postposition -/aa has replaced the original element, as in
                                                                                                       205

nalized forms there are instances of the postposition following finite verb forms,
as in
(GM 1,22)
tar gudra-logo     allim-j-on-nogo

in, for’. In the Qasr Ibrim texts, we find an additional presumably variant form
-doko ‘through, for the sake of’. Although in general, the postposition is re-
stricted to original nouns a possibly early use of the postposition introducing a
causal clause can be found, in a letter from Qasr Ibrim:
(IT I 23.5-6)

‘and take out this measure because you have (it) put away’In Lepsius’ gospel, causal clauses are most often introduced by minaa, translated
as ‘because of, for’ but identical to the interrogative pronoun minaa ‘what?’.
Final -a of this pronoun originates either in the predicative or the direct speech
marker of Old Nobiin. The following examples are from the gospel:
206
(GM 2.15)

‘no one puts wine into old wineskins; because the wine will burst the skins”The construction which shows mina(a) introducing the causal clause corresponds
to the one for the regular interrogative clause. The conclusion can be drawn that
the modern causal clause goes back to an interrogative clause introduced by min-
a(a) ‘what (is it)’.","[204, 205, 206, 207]"
"                                                                                 157
   There is no corresponding form in Old Nobiin as the language had not yet de-
veloped verbal prefixes. Werner (1987:151) rightly rejects any attempt to explain
the element as loan from Arabic. Lepsius (1880:98) derives it from the independ-
ent verb fal- ‘to go out, to come out’, a plausible etymology, as future markers
often grammaticalize from motional verbs.
    It is difficult to trace the origin of the innovated future/intentional in Old No-
biin where the old one is still fully productive. Interestingly, it is in two of the
theological texts that we find clues to the genesis of the new future/intentional.
The two examples support Lepsius’ idea as to the origin of the future prefix fa-
which he developed without any knowledge of Old Nobiin.
(Lec. 100.4-6)

‘a word [Immanuel] which means “God will be with us”The verb pel- ‘to come out, to go out’ which has the alternative forms pil-/pal- is
the first element in a verbal complex which is marked as future. pel- is followed
by adjunctive -a. The literal meaning of the complex is something like ‘god with
us will come out become being’.
    The next example shows pil- as first verb in a periphrastic construction
marked as participle and followed by a predicative:
(ChN. 11.18-19)
armiskide-Ide        oukkout-ilde-kello         ekka   __ pel-j-il      :       pi-ra

sions can be drawn from only two examples. It seems highly plausible that the verb
pel-/pil-/pal- is the origin of the modern verbal prefix fa(a-). Obviously, the modem
construction is a relatively recent development in Nobiin which was not introduced
into the written language and might even be as late as the 15th or 16th centuries.
       In Modern Nobiin, constructions with fa(a)- as first element combine with the
suffixes of the present to produce the following examples:
(Wemer 1987:151)
tan-gii-n    as-ka                   fa-ed-i
his-uncle-GEN daughter-OB)           IFUT-marry-3SGPRES
‘he will marry his uncle’s daughter’
 158
    Corresponding to Werner’s interpretation as ingressive, the correct translation
    would rather be ‘he is about to marry his uncle’s daughter’.
       To detect any differences between the old and new future/intentional one has
    to look at the contexts provided by the longer texts. There are several examples
    of the gospel:
    (GM 1,8)
    ai uk-ka           gatis-ji-s                      aman       nogo   laakeen
    I you-PL-OB)       baptize-PLOBJ-ISGPRET           water     with    but    tar fa-kir           gatis-ji-n                 fogorti    gudsi-logo
    he IFUT-come         baptize-PL-3SGPRES         ghost      holy-with
    ‘I baptized you with water: but he will come (and) baptize you with the Holy Ghost.’    The sentence presents a typical biblical prophecy in which John the Baptist an-
    nounces the future arrival of Jesus. In Old Nobiin, the old future would have
    been found here, in the Modern Nobiin translation of the Gospel of St. Mark, the
    two constructions can be found side by side in certain contexts but the innovated
    future dominates where there is no direct connection with a verb of saying.
   Evidence for the verbal extension with /a(a)- as a late development in Nobiin
is the less close relationship between the element and the main verb. The next
examples show that different objects can be placed between the two:
(Werner 1987:151)
aboo      fa             shongir-k         __ide-e
my father IFUT           money-OB)         send-3SGPRES
“my father will send money’(GM 1,17)
ai     fa      uk-ka                ademi-rii-n   saiaada-ka-j-jir-eeni
I      IFUT    you-PL-OBJ           man-PL-GEN fisherman-OBJ-PLOBJ-make-for
‘and I will make you fishers of men’The question to be discussed here concerns the function of the fa(a)- prefix be-
tween tense and aspect, future and intentional. Lepsius (1880:97ff.) describes the
form as future but assumes that historically, there was a difference between the
old and the new future in that the old construction with suffixes marked a general
future and the new construction with prefix /a(a)- an intention and will to do
something. To his knowledge, this distinction had disappeared at the time of his
research and constructions with fa(a)- were in the process of completely substi-
tuting the old future. As mentioned above, Werner (1987:151) speaks of ingres-
sive with a second and—if at all—third function as intentional and future. He
interprets fa(a)- as expressing a strong certainty that an action or event is going
                                                                                           159
to take place. Thus, in the sentence aboo fa shongir-k ide-e ‘My father will send
money’, the speaker is quite certain that money will be send. Abel’s informants
(1913:13) give rather similar explanations when they translate fa-ju-r ‘I will go
(certainly, I will definitely go)’. According to Abel, fa(a)- functions as future
tense marker if an exact temporal specification is given, e. g.
Sahr-ee-n-ahara             irkuna      fa-ju-r
month-one-GEN-after         home        IFUT-go-ISGPRES
‘After one month I will go home (I definitely intend to go)’This example, however, is an isolated sentence and has no context. In Abel’s
Ermenne narration, the fa(a)- prefix is predominantly used in conditional claus-
es. But there are also some other contexts, e. g.:
(Erm. 56)
ai     Shatirhassan-ga gelaabiye afri-uwo-ga           fa-jan-ara-teer-[eye]        _hari-raton
I      Shatirhassan-oB) dress    Nnice-two-OB)         IFUT-buy-BEN-[she said}      silk-of
‘I will buy two nice silk dresses for Shatirhassan.’The speaker expresses an intention or wish to buy two dresses; she receives
money from her husband, goes to the market and actually buys the dresses.
   In the next sentence, the woman in the story is speaking to herself about her
intentions to kill her stepson. The chain of action as it is planned by her is ar-
ranged as a regular verbal complex consisting of three verbs two of which have
the adjunctive marker -a (aw-oos-a and uuda-ca-tir-a) and only the last one (fa-
di-keer-) takes the prefix fa- and the tense/person marker.

pan-one-into             Opposite-him     poison-OB)      put-PL-BEN     _IFUT-die-CAUSISGPRES-[she said]
 ‘The woman said to herself: “This night for dinner I will make eggs as food into a pan across from
 him I will put poison for him (and) I will kill him” (she said)’ As we learn only a few sentences later, she doesn’t succeed in killing him which
 gives the complex the connotation of an irrealis. But there are different reasons
 why the sentence is interesting to take a closer look at. We have a temporal ex-
 pression here (en-auwo ‘this night’) within a direct speech statement. The refer-
 ence point is the moment of the woman’s monologue in which she locates an
 action subsequent to the moment of speaking. This might be interpreted as a
 160
 future tense function of fa(a)-. At the same time, a strong intention or volition,
 i.e. to kill the boy, is expressed. Thus, we might speak of a future intentional
 with reference to the innovated future of Old Nobiin.
     It is interesting to look at different occurrences of the innovated future/inten-
 tional in Lepsius’ translation of the gospel. Regularly, it is used with the condi-
 tional, e. g. in

‘after those went away on the road, he too mounted his lame horse and went away’According to Abel’s informant, the two sentences differ in that the second with
-(o)os emphasizes the people’s being completely outside or gone. Abel seems to
have missed that the second sentence alone contains two uses of fal-, one with
the other without -(o)os. In fact does the use of -ahara ‘after’ in the second ex-
ample show what the difference is about. The use of -(oJos in connection with
ahara in the first part of the sentence indicates that a completed action or resulta-
tive is marked. In the sequence of events, the going away of ‘those’ was com-
pleted before the going away of the main character of the story started.
    The grammar of Nobiin by Werner (1987:184) once more confirms the inabil-
 ity to infer a clear-cut function of the verbal complex with -(oJos. Werner con-
 fines himself to two observations: -(o)os in a verbal complex marks the “totality”
 of the action and therefore also means the complete execution of an action, i. €.
 the action belongs to the past. For this reason, the complex can only take the
 suffixes of the preterit, a statement which as has been shown does not apply.
    What has been proposed by different authors concerning the function and use
 of -(oJos in a verbal complex and what can be derived from the examples above
 can be summarized as follows: Use of -(o)os with Tenses and Aspects
 no restriction (Reinisch)
 No restriction, but mostly in the preterit and imperative (Lepsius)
 no restriction (Abel)

 resultative or perfective                                                        no function discernible Verbal complexes with the verb -ed in Modern Nobiin have been treated in con-
 nection with -(o)os complexes by most of the aforementioned authors, although
  154
 in comparison they are still infrequent. -ed has undergone semantic change as an
 independent verb, as its meaning was reduced to ‘to marry (or take in marriage)’.
 Lepsius (1880:157) regarded the suffixation of -ed to another verb as insignifi-
 cant. He interpreted e. g., el- and eled- as indiscriminately signifying ‘to find’,
 nal- and naled- ‘to see’, etc.. In contrast to the -(oJos complex, the ed-complex
 was analyzed by him as wide-spread with the present or present participle and
 with the preterit. Reinisch (1879:54) stated that in use and meaning, complexes
 with -(o)os and -ed were identical. This assertion is rejected by Werner
 (1987:184ff.) who interprets -(oJos as more emphatic and -ed complex as syn-
 chronically more or less identical with the simple form. It can be used with the
 present but only with the preterit it occasionally obtains a meaning of “actual or
 factual happening of the action”. Abel (1913:76) interpreted the function of -ed
as intensifying the meaning of the simple verb. His translation of some exam-
ples, however, tells something else: for the verbs tu/b(e)- and oogire- which have
the meaning of ‘demand’ and ‘call’, the ed complexes tulb-ed- and oogr-ed are
formed which are both supposed to mean ‘to bring up, bring about’ (German
‘herbeiflihren’). Here, something like direction or directionality seems to be
indicated as can be seen by the German and English renditions ‘herbei’, ‘up’ and
‘about’. It is worthwhile to look at examples from the Ermenne text. Comparable
to the situation described for Old Nobiin, -ed is attached to other verbs denoting
‘to take’. In these instances, -ed still functions as directional:

when it is used with -ed. The person who dresses is the reference point and again
-ed marks the direction towards it, as in
(Erm. 61)
wee-kon      udr-ed
one-and      put-DIR‘and one put on!’In other instances, it is more difficult to deduce a special function of the -ed
complex. In most of the cases, it seems to follow movement verbs, although the
direction of the movement is not necessarily the subject as reference point:
(Erm. 141)

gazelle-his-OB)        trail-DIR-AD)   village-to go-3SGPRET
 ‘he trailed his gazelle (and) went to the village’ In the last example, tebbaiy ‘to seek’ is conceptualized as a movement verb in
 connection with the movement verbs ‘stand up’ and ‘come out’:
 (Erm. 139)
 kutt-a           fac-ci-san                 gasaal[...) tebbaiy-ed-a
 stand up-ADJ     come out-PL-3PLPRET        gazelle [...] seek-DIR-ADJ
 ‘they stood up and came out and looked for the gazelle’ It can be summarized that -(o)os and -ed are documented                          in Old and Modem
 Nobiin as independent verbs with the meaning of ‘to pull out, to take out’ and ’to
 take, to marry’ respectively. They were used in verbal complexes following the
 adjunctive which could be deleted. In the course of the medieval Nobiin period, a
 functional split took place, as a result of which on the one hand the original func-
 tion and meaning was preserved, on the other hand a process of desemanticiza-
 tion and grammaticalization was initiated. Mostly in combination with motion or
 transfer verbs, -(oJos now               functions as directional marking         ‘movement away’
 from what might be called a deictic center. A deictic usage can also be found
 with -ed which mostly in combination with verbs meaning ‘to take’ or transfer
 verbs marks ‘movement towards’ a deictic center. As the examples show the
 deictic center is a point of reference which can be either animate or inanimate.
 There seem to be restrictions as to the use of tense and aspect with -(o)os and -ed
 at that stage. The further development can only be reconstructed on the basis of
  156
 Modern Nobiin. Another functional split must have taken place which might
 originally have been restricted to -(oJos. The directional was now used to empha-
 size the result or completion of an action. Werner’s statement that the resultative
 function logically entailed a restriction in the use of tense and aspect could not
 be corroborated. At the same time, an expansion must have taken place as to the
 verbs which can be used in an -(oJos complex. A restriction to motion and trans-
 fer verbs is no longer found. The deictic function may still have been productive
over a period of time but was more and more restricted. In Modern Nobiin, it is
only preserved in lexicalized form with the transfer verb jan- ‘to trade, to ex-
change’. With -ed, the further development is less evident. There seems to be an
analogous use as a completion or resultative marker in combination with the
preterit. It can, however, still be used with the present and Abel’s (see above)
translations suggest that at least at the beginning of the twentieth century ves-
tiges of the directional function were preserved. The problem of determining any
function of the verbal complexes with -(o)os and -ed which shows in all gram-
matical descriptions of Nobiin is evidence of the last stage in the development of
these complexes. The process of change can be reconstructed as
“directional”   —p   “definitive?   ——»    “resultative?   ——>     no functionwith the first to last existing simultaneously. The inflationary use of the two
elements with all kinds of verbs and in non-resultative contexts will finally result
in a complete semantic and functional loss, a process which is nearly completed.
It is interesting to note that the whole development from the Old Nobiin stage at
which only few examples of -(oJos- and -ed complexes with relatively clear-cut
function as directionals can be found to the more or less complete semantic and
functional loss took about seven hundred years. One mustn’t, however, mr
that we only know about the written language of the medieval period. In spoke’
Nobiin, the development will have been further progressed.","[153, 154, 155, 156, 157]"

others and is difficult to explain. It is interesting to note that the endings based on                                     ;
-ko- which were predominant in Old Nobiin have completely disappeared. From
the plural endings, it can be deduced that the construction with -/o formed the
basis of the modern forms. In Werner’s paradigm, forms are even more reduced.
    Werner (1987:161) presents a second paradigm for the conditional which dif-                                             f|

Old Nobiin. Only Reinisch (ibid.) lists -kega as 1st person singular alternative                                            f

either the imperative or the so-called innovated future/intentional (see below
chapter 10.5). It has been mentioned above that Old Nobiin had an optional addi-
tional marker which introduced a conditional clause, alesin ‘truly’. In Modern
Nobiin, is has been replaced by the optional particle -on/-lon ‘if? suffixed to the
subject of the protasis, so that a double marking is still possible.
   In Modern Nobiin, the endings of the conditional can also follow the perfect
with -ko/-kun. In the Ermenne narrative, we find the following example:
 (Erm 4)

 Shatirhassan-OBJ           _IFUT-call-1SGPRET-[...] ‘if | become pregnant and deliver a son, I will call him Shatirhassan [...]’ The literal meaning of the sentence is ‘if | have become pregnant and have deliv-
 ered a son, I will have called him Shatirhassan’. The function of these construc-
 tions with the past can be deduced discussing the following dialogue between
  Shatirhassan and his father. The two sentences are consecutive in the text.

  1      marry-DIR-ISGCOND your _ this-woman_ IFUT-stepmother-INCH-DIR-BEN-3SGPRES
   ‘his father said to him: “o my son, if I marry this woman she will become a stepmother for you””   Abel (1913:13ff.) gives a rather convincing explanation of the difference in
   meaning between the two constructions. The present and future are used in the
   father’s answer because it is certain that the woman will become the boy’s step-
   108
mother as an outcome of the marriage. That the two will be better off after the
marriage, as the boy suggests, is, however, far from certain. Thus, according to
Abel, the past is used. What Abel describes is the difference between a real con-
dition and an irrealis. The father’s statement presents a real condition, because a
certainty is expressed, the event is taking place. By contrast, the son’s prediction
consists of an irrealis. As the development of the story shows, the situation of the
son deteriorates, because his stepmother tries to kill him. In the light of this de-
velopment, some of the promises made by his father’s new wife are unreal in that
they are blatant lies. They are therefore marked as irrealis, as in
(Erm 16)
ibo-loni         aiga   ed-oo-ko-kani                ai   ikka   in-nekini   ahsen-ga

IFUT-serve-ISGPRET      you-and      IFUT-love-1SGPRET
‘if your father marries me, I will serve you better than this and | will love you’The examples show that in Modern Nobiin real and unreal conditions can be
expressed and morphologically distinguished. Real conditions are characterized
by the endings of the conditional in the protasis and the endings of imperative or
innovated future which takes the suffixes of the present in the apodosis. In the
irrealis, the endings of the conditional follow the perfect marker in the protasis,
and in the apodosis, the innovated future is followed by the suffixes of the pret-
erit resulting in a future preterit. The first construction resembles those of real
conditions in Old Nobiin presented above. Whether the irrealis was expressed
accordingly in the old stage of the language has so far been left open. It seems
that there are only three instances of an irrealis documented in the texts. One of
these examples comes from Qasr Ibrim:
(IT 17 ii 15-16)
i-san-en-appa                 nodu    nok-in-ka     istauros-ildo _ ollir-imen-di-sana-sin
know-3PLPRETIISUB-?-for       Lord    glory-GEN-OBJ cross-upon —_ hang-NEG-FUT-3PLPRETII-EMPH
“for if they had known, they would not have hanged upon the cross the Lord of Glory’The apodosis has the endings of the old future followed by the suffixes of the
preterit II indicative, comparable to the construction in Modern Nobiin presented
above. The protasis differs in that the verb is preterit I] subjunctive which is in
accordance with its status as subordinate clause marked by -appa ‘for’. This
might be due to the fact that contrary to the examples of Modern Nobiin where
the events and actions described are in the future at the time of speaking and still
an—if unlikely—possibility, the event described in the Old Nobiin example is no
longer possible because at the time of speaking, a different course of action has
                                                                                                109
already been taken. In Old Nobiin, an additional element -en is inserted which
seems to be documented in only one other non-restorated instance:
(IT 1412-3)
iri    inno duar[a?)en-kan an         ennal          di-me-dra-lo
you    here   be-PRED-?-3SGCOND       my brother     die-NEG-FUT-PRED-EMPH
‘if you had been here, my brother would not have died (lit.: ‘will not die’)This example has the 3% person conditional -kan in the position of -appa in the
example before. Although the past is not morphologically marked, the sentence
is an irrealis in the same way as has been found before. The events described
refer to a possibility which existed in the past.
      Browne compares the element -en with Lepsius’ (1880:113—114) marker of a
so-called electivum. According to Lepsius, it is mostly used with the preterit, and
from his examples it actually seems to be a form of the irrealis. Although Lepsius
lists paradigms for the present and perfect with -en, there seems unfortunately to
be only one instance in the texts:
(GM 14.5)

 the Old Nobiin examples above. The evidence, however, is too scarce for both
 Old and Modern Nobiin, to draw any conclusion. It can only be said that an ele-
 ment -en seems to have existed already at the Old Nobiin stage which marked an
 irrealis, but seldom used. More on conditional clauses will be presented and
 discussed in chapter 11 on syntax.","[106, 107, 108, 109, 110]"

subject which was regular in Old Nobiin has disappeared. Apart from this reduc-
tion the old system remained intact.","[36, 37]"

                                                                                                              149
In the first example, jan- ‘to trade, to exchange’ combined with -oos obtains the
meaning of ‘to sell’ which also implies a motion away, in this case away from a
seller. In the second example, jan- combined with the verb -ed ‘to take’ has the
meaning of ‘to buy’ which also implies a motion towards the buyer.
   The presumably earliest instance of jana-os- can be found in Lectionary
112.10 where it has the meaning of ‘to redeem’. This could be evidence of an
origin of jan(a)-os- as ‘to buy off’ with a secondary expansion of the meaning to
the more general ‘sell’. The original verbal complex denoting ‘sell’ seems to be
jan-a den-/tir-, a combination of the verbs ‘to exchange/to trade’ and ‘to give’.
 Both verbal complexes are documented in the Ibrim texts, but only jan-os seems
to have survived in modern Nobiin (see below).
       Most of the other examples from Old Nobiin show -ed/-it/-eet attached to an-
other verb denoting ‘to take’. Reference points concerning the direction indicated
by -ed are the morphologically marked subjects of the sentences:
(M. 3,15-16)
man _ itt-il-lon              kumpu-k(a) en-et-a                  ?
that     woman-SUBJ-and       egg-OB)         take-DIR-ADJ (auch: 1,49)
                                                           ——
‘and the woman took up the egg’(M. att
agopp-il-lon           kumpu-ka dum-et-a
skipper-SUBJ-and       egg-OB)    take-DIR-AD)
 ‘and the skipper took the egg’ (auch: 1,57; 59)
                                        ———
 (ChN. 8.3)         2
 tipit-il          ¥ [kka]    dum-it-in
 evening-SUBJ       3PL-OBJ   take-DIR-3SGSUBPRES
 ‘as the evening takes them’ As to the origin or further development of the verbal complex, one example can
 be found which shows -ed in an ambiguous position between the original verb
 ‘to take’ and a marker of directionality or even resultative marker. The sentence
 (IT Il, 51.5)
 petti-ka      nol-a               ej-j-ara-sin
 date-OB)      gulp (down)-ADJ     _DIR-PLOBJ-PREDPRETI-EMPH
 is translated by Brown as ‘...I took the dates and gulped them down’ but analo-
 gous to the aforementioned examples it could also be rendered as ‘...1 gulped the
 dates down’. With regard to the further development of the complex, a transla-
 tion ‘I completely gulped the dates down’ seems also adequate.
    It can be concluded that an opposition between morphologically marked di-
 rectionality—“motion towards” and “motion away”—existed in Old Nobiin. The
 150
 markers were independent verbs which semantically contained the direction they
 indicated. Both constructions, however, were rarely used. Only very few in-
 stances of the verbal complex with -ed could be found, some more of the one
 with -(oJos. -(o)Jos and -ed follow the adjunctive in this complex which can,
 however, be omitted. There is at least one instance where -ed follows the indica-
 tive (jan-ona is-sana) which looks like a periphrastic indicative.
     The question arises what happened to these constructions in Modern Nobiin.
 In contrast to Old Nobiin, verbal complexes with the suffix -(o)os as a second or
 last element are abundant in the modern language. In Abel’s Ermenne narrative,
 more than one hundred complexes with -(oJos can be counted within the two
 hundred sentences. In spite of the extensive occurrence of -(o)os complexes all
 authors found it rather difficult to understand and analyze its function and mean-
 ing. More than one hundred years ago, Richard Lepsius (1880:156) wrote about
 the use of -(ojos:
Eine sehr gewdhnliche Erweiterung der Verbalstimme ist die in -ose. Sie kann sich fast
mit jedem Verbum verbinden, [...], ohne daB sich eine bestimmte Verinderung der Bedeu-
 tung nachweisen lieBe. Es scheint, daB sie nur den Nachdruck vermehrt, mit welchem ein
 Wort oder eine Form gebraucht werden soll, oder da8 nur der Tonfall den Sprechenden
 veranlaBt, das Verbum mit oder ohne diese schwere Endung zu gebrauchen, so willkirlich
 bedient man sich derselben anscheinend und nicht selten in einem und demselben Satz.
Lepsius had no knowledge of Old Nobiin when he wrote his grammar. Thus, he
(1880:156, 380) considered it rather peculiar that the verb jan- ‘to trade’ signi-
fied ‘to buy’, when -ed was suffixed (jan-ed), and ‘to sell’? when -(o)os was at-
tached (jan-os). These examples, however, show that at least remnants of the
erstwhile directional function of the two verbs are preserved in the lexicalize
verbs ‘to buy’ and ‘to sell’. Lepsius seems to interpret -(oJos as some sort
emphasizer, but he was willing to admit that he was not able to derive a m
special meaning. Two examples from the translation of the gospel analyzed
him show almost identical contexts with and without -(oJos.
fogorti   _nijis    fal-on                      ‘the impure spirit came out’

Satan     come out-DIR-3SGPRETMore important is his observation of the more or less unrestricted use of the
suffix with all kinds of verbs. He furthermore states a prevailing occurrence of
-(o)os with the preterit and imperative—the latter conforming with an emphasiz-
ing function—and a more rare use with the present or future. On the basis of the
texts collected by him, Lepsius, however, concludes that the element is restricted
to the 3"" person singular and plural, and never occurs with 1st or 2""4 persons, an
                                                                                    151
allegation which is not supported by his translation of the gospel. Although most
of the -(o)os complexes are found with the preterit, this is at least to some extent
owing to the sort of texts available which are predominantly narratives in the
preterit. The next two examples present a verbal complex with -(o)os followed
by the imperative and present.
(GM I, 25)

‘offer a sacrifice, for you are healthy’
Reinisch (1879:55ff.) speaks of the simple form of the verb and an extension
with -(o)os which he describes as the actual taking place of the action denoted by
the simple verb. Thus, he distinguishes fog ‘to beat, to strike’ and fog-os ‘to actu-
ally beat/strike, to really beat/strike’. From this primary meaning, he derives a
secondary one: fog-os ‘to already strike’. In another of his examples, the simple
form mafa fal-in is translated by him as ‘the sun rises (it is her nature to do so)’
whereas the present form mafa fal-os-in has the presumed meaning of ‘the sun is
already rising, carries out the rising’, and the past mafa fal-os-on denotes ‘the
sun has already risen’. Reinisch does not mention any restriction as to the use of
tense and aspect for the verbal complex with -(oJos.
   A somewhat different approach can be found in Abel’s (1913:71) attempt at
 interpreting the function of -(o)os. Quite familiar is his statement that in many
 examples a difference in the meaning of verbs with or without the element is not
 identifiable. Abel quotes his Nubian                 informant who       illustrates that the simple
 verb fal- ‘come out, go out’ differs from the verbal complex fal-os in emphasiz-
 ing the being completely outside. The complexes are furthermore—and this is
 new—supposed to mark an explicit or implicit object. Thus, the Nubian infor-
 mant distinguishes between fog-in ‘he strikes’ and fog-oos-in ‘he strikes him’.
 Abel tried to verify this allegation and counted only six complexes with -(o)os
 without explicit or implicit object out of altogether thirty-four occurrences.
 Again, most of the examples from the Ermenne narrative are in the preterit:
 (Erm. 10)
 junt-an-oos-on

 “she became pregnant’

     ‘she gave birth to a son and the horse gave birth to a mare’     The next sentence has a past conditional, followed by a future preterit which is
     actually an irrealis:
 (Erm. 4)
 ai-loni_ junt-an-oo-ko-kaiye                            tood-ee-koon-unn-oo0-ko-kaiyeei

 Jaatirhassan-oB)     —_1FUT-call-1 SGPRET    [...] ‘if | have become pregnant and I have given birth to a son, | will call him faatirhassan (lit. ‘will have
 called’)’ The present is indicated, although not explicitly marked in the complex with
 -(o)os and a following verb in the present:
(Erm. 3)
joominsaatilaiyam-ee-ka          ideni       _iu-ga    enji-dani          gamma tig-o-j-a

asked from god’Here, an imperfective or more precisely a progressive aspect is conveyed by the
present       in the subordinate       clause. The           next example      which    comprises   a condi-
tional sentence in direct speech has two -(oJos complexes, one of which is in the
conditional present, the other in the future:
(Erm. 19)

‘his father said to him: “Oh my son, if I marry, this woman will become your stepmother 299There are only a few examples where contexts can be compared to help to draw
any conclusion concerning the function of the -(oJos complex. Sentences 139
and 141 are rather similar with exception of -(oJos- being present in one sentence
and absent in the other.","[149, 150, 151, 152, 153]"
