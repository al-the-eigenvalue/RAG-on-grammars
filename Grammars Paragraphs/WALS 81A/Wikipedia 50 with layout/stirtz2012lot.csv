to define how a word boundary is determined and how the terms ‘root’, ‘stem’ and
‘word’ are used in this thesis. The morphemes attached to roots and stems have
different functions, different morphophonological alternations, or in other ways are
treated as different kinds of morphemes in the language.",[72]
"Although uncommon, it is possible for the subject pronoun to be repeated following

by an optional possessive pronoun (POS), and one or more optional adjectives. More
than one adjective in the same noun phrase is rare and no prescribed order in the
noun phrase can be determined. It is also possible for demonstratives (DEM) to
precede alienable possessive pronouns. The possessors of inalienable nouns—
kinship terms and body parts—precede the possessed noun, and the possessors of
alienable nouns follow the noun.",[304]

parts and kinship terms—the other with alienable nouns. The two sets have different
syntax. The inalienable set precedes the noun, the alienable set follows it. The
examples of (2-4) demonstrate the order of possessors and possessed nouns.",[79]
"14.2 Grammatical function of constituentsNouns function as subjects, objects, indirect objects, or objects of prepositional
phrases. In (1), mɛ̀ɛn̄ ‘youth’ has the role of agent and functions as the subject of
the clause. The noun nāmsá ‘food’ has the role of a theme, functioning as an object,
whereas mə̄əð̄ ə́n ‘grandfather’ is the recipient and indirect object.(1)    mɛ̀ɛn̄        māār-sá           nāms-á       mə̄əð̄ =ə᷇n

       ‘The youth leader bought the food for the grandfather.’Case marking does not occur on subject or object nouns, but dative nouns take the
clitic =A᷇n as shown in (1) and (2) and have the role of beneficiary or recipient. In
(2), the noun kááy-ɛ̄ɛḡ g=ɛ́ ‘night-PL=RDM’ functions as the object of the general
preposition ɛ́ (GP).(2)    ɔ̀      ná     bɛ́r-s=āná            ɲālg=a᷇n            ɛ́    kááy-ɛ̄ɛḡ g=ɛ́
       and REL explain-COMP=PAS small.ones=DAT GP night-PL=RDM
       ‘ . . and that which is explained (fable) to children at night.’Objects and indirect objects are verb complements, whereas prepositional phrases,
locative phrases and adverbs are verb adjuncts. In (2), the prepositional phrase ɛ́
kááyɛ̄ɛḡ gɛ́ ‘at night’ is an adjunct to the verb bɛ́rsāná ‘explain’ expressing time. In
(3), the locative phrase ūfú ɔ́ɔĺ ‘in the tree’ and adverb d̪ɛɛ̄ n̄ ɛ̄ ‘only’ are both adjuncts
to the verb àn ‘stay’ expressing location.

follow the verb, and adjuncts follow verb complements. Adverbs are least
connected with the verb and the most moveable of the adjuncts, sometimes being
fronted before the verb, although not usually before the subject. When more than
one kind of adverb is present, manner and directional adverbs normally precede
adverbs of place, time, and other adverbs. Negation markers can be analyzed as
adverbs, since they follow the verb and its adjuncts and have the same function as
adverbs. They are always sentence-final and cannot be fronted before the verb as
some adverbs can.","[282, 283]"

(17). In this concluding sentence of a narrative where a fox and hyena try
throughout to capture and eat him, the devil creature is fronted in order to emphasize
him as being the victor.(17)   ɲɛ́ɛŕ ɛ̀mà=

most important, by fronting it. The noun subject Fə́nd̪ì-n which normally follows
the subordinate conjunction ɛ́ gārá ‘when’ is sentence-initial.(18)   fə́nd̪ì=n    ɛ́ gārá    d̪àɔ̀-s=ə᷅          mɔ̀rāā-gg=ɛ᷇=nɛ́

       ‘When Fandi fought with the government, . . ’ (Fand1)Objects are brought into focus by moving them to a pre-verbal position. The object
mii-n ‘chicken’ in (19) is out of its normal post-verbal position to emphasize that it
is the ‘chicken’ being thrown away and not the ‘goat’.(19)   mīí=

sentence. The meaning is ‘It is those kinds of women and not others whom God
blesses.’(20)   nà    a᷆n              gg=

Gaahmg is a morphologically rich language, employing many suffixes and clitics on
nouns, adjectives, and verbs. [ATR] quality and tone distinguish a significant
number of lexemes and grammatical functions. Several specific processes of
consonant weakening, vowel elision, [+ATR] spreading, [+round] spreading, and
morphological tone rules, account for the vast majority of alternations when
morphemes are combined.","[315, 316, 317, 318]"

with their referent; the segment -gg- marks the plural object (bɛ̀l-d̪=ɛ̄ɛḡ gà
‘beat=3sN/3pA’, bɛ̄l-d̪=ɛ̄ɛg̀ gà ‘beat=3pN/3pA’). The different tonal allomorphs of
the objects predictably attach to different subject forms as further described in
10.4.2. In marked third object pronouns, the segment -gg- marks the plural object
(bīl-d̪=ììggə̀ ‘beat=3sN/3pAM’, bìl-d̪=íìggə̀ ‘beat=3pN/3pAM’) as well as a
singular object combined with a plural subject (bīld̪=īìggì ‘beat=3pN/3sAM’).
Again, the different tonal allomorphs of the objects predictably attach to different
subject forms. Syntactic pronoun subjects of agented passive clauses have the same
form as subjects of active clauses [ɛ̄(ɛ̄n) ‘he (3sN)’, ɛ̄ggà ‘they (3pN)’]. They are
independent and agree in number with the referent. For these pre-verbal patients or
themes, the agented passive verb clitic =E᷇ marks that a singular agent comes after
the verb and the suffix =ÉĒ marks that a plural agent comes after the verb.","[227, 228]"

In contrast with the agented passive of 10.2, which always has an explicit agent in
the clause, the passive of this section never encodes an agent. Passive and active
forms are compared in (12). In the normal SVO word order of active transitive
clauses such as (a-b, d), the noun preceding the verb is the subject and agent. In (b),
the L-M tone (with L-H becoming L-M by {M9}) of the completive form indicates
the third singular subject while L-L tone would indicate a third plural subject. In
passive clauses such as (c,e), the clitic =ĀnÁ indicates that an implied agent is
absent from the clause. In that case, the patient (syntactic subject) normally
precedes the verb as in (c) but may follow the verb as in (e) and in (13). The clitic
=ÁnÁ attaches to stems with vowel-final suffixes such as the completive forms of
(c,e) and the clitic =Á attaches to stems with consonant-final suffixes such as the
continuous past form of (13) and to suffix-less stems.

person patients or themes are possible; clauses such as ‘*I was struck’ are not
possible.","[219, 220]"
"In the following chapters, word categories are discussed one-by-one. For each, we
first discuss the function followed by the forms of morphemes attached to roots or
stems. Because possessive pronouns are important for the discussion on nouns and
verbs, pronouns in general are discussed first, followed by nouns, adjectives, verbs,
prepositions, locatives, and adverbs. Each of these is a lexical category, as are
conjunctions discussed in 15.2.

The pronoun system in Gaahmg distinguishes three persons, two numbers (singular
and plural), and six cases (possessive, subject, object, dative, reflexive,
prepositional). There is no dual, no gender distinction, no inclusive/exclusive
distinction, and no logophoric distinction. As expected in an SVO language, subject
pronouns are pre-verbal and object and dative pronouns are post-verbal. Possessive
pronouns are pre-nominal for inalienable nouns and post-nominal for alienable
nouns. Prepositional pronouns have the prepositional marker prefix d̪- and reflexive
pronouns make use of the possessed noun ‘body’.","[77, 78]"

singular object. These grammatical structures are representative of the singular and

pronoun, and in (c) a marked object pronoun. The clause of (d) has the same
meaning as those of (b-c), but the pronoun patient is in focus, being a syntatic

9.1    IntroductionThe verb word structure can be ordered according to the schemes of (1). The verb
root tends to be monosyllabic, with optional onset and coda. The verb stem is
composed of the root, and optional slots for antipassive (ANTIP), causative (CAUS),
and modal or aspect morphemes. The verb word is made up of the stem and
optional slots for agented passive (PAS.A), passive (PAS) or bound pronoun, and
imperfect (IPF), perfect (PF), subordinate (SBO1,2), or relative clause definite marker
clitics (RDM).","[172, 173, 174]"

      ‘Jader led his very large group.’ (Fand24-25)Dative verbs have the arguments subject, object, and indirect object which in the
clause of (9) have the semantic roles of agent, theme, and recipient. The presence of
a recipient or beneficiary in a clause requires the presence of an agent or experiencer
and patient or theme. In other words, a dative cannot be present without a subject
and object. The dative verbs attested are /gàf /‘give’, /bɛ̀ɛ ̀ / ‘tell, say’, /bàg/ ‘bring’.",[284]

dative pronoun spreads leftward onto the root {M3}. There is no such harmony with
independent dative pronouns as seen in (23a).

             ‘He gave you a chicken.’                                 ‘He gave you a chicken.’Similar to object pronouns, dative pronouns do not occur along with a dative noun as
in (24).(24)        *ɟɛ̄n    gə̀ù-s=ii᷇n        mīī-n     kàmàlɔ̀gg=āān

            ‘The person gave the goat to the woman.’Although the dative noun and object noun can have either order in a clause as in
(25a), the independent dative pronoun must immediately follow the verb when
occurring along with a noun object. For example, the independent pronoun
following the noun object in (25c) is ungrammatical.(25a)        ɟɛ̄n        gàɔ̀-sā     mīīn        kàmàlɔ̀gg=āān        /     kàmàlɔ̀gg=āān         mīīn

        ‘The person gave her the goat.’                      ‘The person gave her the goat.’When an imperfect suffix such as =É in (26a) or an object pronoun such as =ì in
(b) are attached to the verb, the independent dative pronoun can follow the verb
word.(26a)        á     ɲa᷇m                      háshīm=á

follows the object pronoun and can be separate or attached. When attached, the
dative pronoun can be attached directly as in (27b) or n can be inserted between then
as in (c). In (d), the object pronoun follows an attached dative pronoun, but the third
singular object pronoun has a different form [=ÉÉn (which becomes =íín through
[+ATR] spreading) instead of =E (3sA) or =EEggÀ (3pA)]. An object can also
follow a dative pronoun by having a prepositional prefix d̪- as will be shown in (31e)
of 5.7 and is then a prepositional pronoun instead of an object pronoun.","[88, 89, 90]"

Gaahmg (Gaam, enthologue code [tbi]) is a Nilo-Saharan, Eastern Sudanic language
spoken in the Ingessana Hills of the Blue Nile Province of North Sudan, near the
Ethiopian border. For centuries, the Gaahmg people have fought off invaders
entering their hills. Even today, their culture and language have been less influenced
by outsiders than those of other ethnic groups in the Blue Nile Province. Although
Gaahmg speakers outnumber speakers of other languages in the area, little
documentation has been done of their language. This work presents a description of
Gaahmg grammar, including its phonology, morphology, and syntax.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

Only the interrogative pronouns of (6b-e) agree in number with the noun phrase
which they replace. Some interrogative pronouns have a marked form when they
replace words which occur in an uncommon position in the clause, but are otherwise
unmarked. Other interrogative pronouns only have one form regardless of its
position in the clause. When any of the interrogative pronouns are pre-verbal, the
clause-final subordinate clitic =É (SBO) of 7.7 and 8.3.8 attaches sentence-finally.
When an interrogative pronoun replacing an adverb is pre-verbal, the verb-final
subordinate clitic =i᷅ (SBO1) of 10.7 is attached to the verb.","[311, 312]"

of which is the conjunction ɛ́ gārá ‘when’ which often introduces tail-head linkage.
In the second line of (2), the subordinate clause refers to ‘an arrival at the well’
implied by the previous nuclear clause, before continuing with the next nuclear
clause in the third line. In this way, the subordinate clause links new information
with old information contained in the subordinate clause. The verbs of tail-head
linkage are most commonly completive verbs, but can also be incompletive or past-
continuous.(2)    ɛ̄    dɔ̄ɔs̀ -s   ɛ̄     wāɟ-ɟ     d̪ūmùùn     wāā=lg            ā

subject, it refers back to the object. In (29c), the plural noun ɟɔ̄gg ‘people/officials’
and the third plural reflexive ììŋg are objects of the verb máð ‘refuse’. The noun
ɟɔ̄gg represents the government and is emphasized with the reflexive, possibly
because of previous bad encounters with them. Reflexives are not found to be used
as repeated subjects.","[90, 91]"

pronouns, there are different tonal allomorphs when attached to different subject
forms. Third singular =E,᷇ first plural áāggá and second plural =ÓŌggÓ objects
have underlying initial HM tone when attached to third singular verbs, but otherwise
have no tone on the first syllable. Third plural =ÉÈggÀ objects have underlying
initial HL tone when attached to third singular and third plural verbs, but otherwise
have no tone on the first syllable. First a and second =O singular objects have no
underlying tone regardless of the subject form to which they are attached. Third
marked objects have underlying initial Low tone =ì, =ììggə̀ when attached to third
singular verbs, and have underlying initial HL tone =íìggì, =íìggə̀ when attached to
third plural verbs, but otherwise have no tone on the first syllable.",[229]
"Just as noun roots attach different suffixes depending on the root-final segment,
noun stems attach different clitics depending on the stem-final segment. Each
grammatical noun clitic has different segmental or tonal allomorphs, sometimes
differing according to the following stem-final segments: underlying31
   As discussed in 2.3.6, although there is no way to distinguish whether the underlying-final
segments are plosives or approximants, the definite clitic =An attaches to stems with
underlying-final approximants and the definite clitic =Vn attaches to stems with underlying-
final vowels.

Agented passive, passive, antipassive, and causative morphemes are syntactically
distinguished in a section on verbal valency. Non-verbal clauses with two sets of
copulas are compared. Relative clauses, noun phrase agreement, and possession are
also discussed, among other grammatical aspects. Chapter 15 presents sentence-

texts of various genres are presented in chapter 17 to verify the morphology and

the clause (DAT, ACM) or indicates its place in the clause (COP, RDM, SBO).","[72, 73]"

"Although adjectives commonly function as modifiers, they can also be used
nominally or verbally. However, they are not used in some of the syntactic
constructions of either nouns or verbs, and there are some differences in the
morphology when used as either category. Thus, they can be analyzed as a distinct
lexical category from either nouns or verbs.

The noun word structure can be ordered according to the schemes of (1). The noun
stem consists of the root and optional singular or plural suffixes. The noun word
consists of the stem, and optional slots for copula (COP), definite (DEF), locative

verb form to which it is attached. Thus, the clitic allomorphs are listed in
parentheses next to each form. The object clitics attached to first singular and third
plural verbs have no underlying tone on initial vowels. Thus, they are assigned the
subject person tone from the elided completive suffix vowel. The initial vowels of
the clitics are assigned first singular Mid tone in (a), and are assigned third plural
Low tone in (c). However, the clitics in (b) with underlying initial High tone are not
