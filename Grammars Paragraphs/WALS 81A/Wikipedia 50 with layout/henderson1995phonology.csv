"   Where there is more than one third person referent on stage at a time in a discourse, the
subjects and objects are made explicit more often, to ensure that the hearer can keep track of
the referents of the clauses. (As is often the case, folk stories show less explicit reference to
the participants, because everyone knows who does what in the story, and it is not necessary
to be as explicit. Everyone knows, that is, except the linguist from another culture!). Text (d)
in §2.4 provides an example of a text with more than one third person referent on stage at a
time. It is by the same author as the fishing story referred to above. The topic of the text is a
savage dog, which is introduced and named in clause l a, then referred to with third person
singular verb parts in clause 1 b. The author disclaims responsibility in sentence 2 ,
introducing himself with a pronoun, and using the word 'dog' in sentence 3 . H e names the
culprit, his brother Nkal, with a noun, and uses the word 'dog' again in sentence 4. Nkal ' s
name is repeated i n sentence 5, but this time the other third person referent i s understood to
be the dog, without specific reference. The dog is mentioned again specifically in the next
sentence, number 6. It remains the topic of the rest of that paragraph, sentences 7 to 9, being
referred to only pronominally. Sentence 1 0 begins a narrative episode, in which Mepe and
his son Yidika are introduced by name. In this episode each sentence uses a noun to refer to
one of these actors, as the initiative moves from one third person referent to another in quick
succession. The result of the incident comes in sentence 1 7, but the dog is not mentioned
specifically - it is just the third person singular referent of the verb. The text ends with a
specific reference to a safe road for people to follow.
(2) Order of items in the clause   Apart from the subject and object of the clause, other items can be included at will when
their semantic content is to be made explicit, up to a limit of five items in any one clause,
including the predicate. The histogram in Table 2. 1 .8 . 1 shows the proportion of transitive
and intransitive clauses having each number of items. The histogram is based on a sample of
667 clauses all from texts or conversation.",[66]

grand total of 94 contrastively different sounds in the language.
   Traditional phonemic principles call for the interpretation of 'ambivalent' sequences of
consonants, to decide whether they should be regarded as consonant clusters or complex
consonants. Normally one would look for clusters of heterorganic consonants on which to
base a cluster solution when interpreting prenasalised stops, stops with nasal release,
palatalisation and labialisation, but there are no sequences of consonants that do not involve
one or more of these features. Simultaneous bilabial closure involves two articulations, but
they occur simultaneously, and act as a multiplier, covering the prenasalisation or nasal
release of a stop as well as the stop itself. Clearly the 'unambivalent cluster' criterion must be
relaxed, or the sum total of consonant phonemes could approach the possible maximim of
56!
  The sequences [pY], [kY] and [mY] cited in Tables 1. 2. 6 and 1.2.7 above are heterorganic,
even though they involve palatalisation. They provide the basis for recognising consonant -
semivowel clusters. [Y] and [W] can then be regarded as allophones of y and w respectively.
Turning now to prenasalisation and nasal release, it is observed that they constitute a reverse
sequence, stop-nasal and nasal-stop, so those clusters are allowed on that basis.
   Following traditional phonemic principles, the consonants with simultaneous bilabial
closure would be set apart as separate phonemes, adding
   tp        dp      kp
   rim       nm      ngmand Iv
12to the thirteen basic phonemes illustrated in Table 1.2.1, making a total of 20 basic
consonantal phonemes.
   In this analysis a consonant would have the formula C1(C2)S, where if Cl and C2 are
both manifested, they are homorganic in the order nasal-stop or stop-nasal. The order stop­
nasal only occurs with post-alveolar and velar consonants. With bilabial consonants, S can
be manifested by yand w simultaneously.
   Non-nasal continuants are a special case, with the formula C(y), where yoccurs only with
1 and v.","[19, 20]"

     The predicate nucleus consists of the verb root and sometimes an incorporated noun.
( 1 ) Noun incorporation
   Noun incorporation is a flexible and ongoing process in Yele, and is used to refer to an
action affecting a generic noun in the role of Patient or Goal. The noun incorporated must be
non- specific, and the resulting predicate is intransitive and continuous. As Mithun
(1984: 849) has pointed out, the noun cannot co-occur with deictics or numerals. Noun
incorporation in Yele matches her type 1.1 classification, composition by juxtaposition:
       ... a V and its direct object are simply juxtaposed to form an especially tight
       bond. The V and N remain separate words phonologically; but as in all
       compounding, the N loses its syntactic status as an argument of the sentence,
       and the VN unit functions as an intransitive predicate.",[34]
"
2.1 PREDICAnON  Yele verbs move through a multidimensional array of:
        indicative, imperative and habitual moods, doubled by
        continuous and punctiliar aspect, and multiplied by
        six tenses:
           future, immediate future, present,
           immediate past, near past and remote past.
   The verbs also agree with the person and number of the subject and object. The
morphemes marking all these parameters are merged into portmanteau forms which defy
simple analysis, and contribute to the reputation Yele has of being impossible to learn,
whether by Papua New Guinean or by foreigner.
   The morphemes appended to the verb root - prefixes and suffixes in many languages -
are in Yele separated from the verb root on phonological grounds. Thus a predicate consists
of a prenuclear component, verb root and postnuclear component, each written as a separate
word. Many verb roots vary in form to express the mood, aspect and tense by using
suppletive forms or reduplication. (Some irregular verbs have as many as five different
roots. See §2.1.4 for the details.)
   The verbal prenucleus also expresses the mood, aspect and tense, along with the person
and number of the subject of the predication. (I am using the term 'aspect' in the 'catch-all'
sense, so 'aspect' in this chapter includes more than duration. It also includes the items
elaborated in §2.1.7, such as indefiniteness, commonality and repetition.) It is in the
prenucleus that a number of deictics can be incorporated. (See §2.l.S and §2.1.7).
   With transitive verbs the postnucleus expresses the person and number of the object, but
also reflects the mood, aspect and tense, and often monitors the person and number of the
subject as well. (See §2.1.6).
                                             14
                                                                                                   15   With intransitive verbs, the postnucleus expresses the duration, mood and tense of the
verb, and then the number of the subject. In imperatives, the postnucleus also monitors the
person of the subject. (See Tables 2. 1. 6.1 and 2. 1. 6. 2.)
  The following examples illustrate the Ergative-Absolutive system operating in the clause.
The Ergative referent is marked with <ngb, while the Absolutive referent is unmarked.
   (1)      a.   [Kaawa �] E de                     m:uu teo
                 Kaawa SG.E PLIM.PST.3.SB see               T.PI.PRX.3PL.O.MF
                 Kaawa saw them.                                    (transitive, implicit object)
           b.    [M:aa �] E [Kaawa] A de                         m:uu.
                 Dad SG.E Kaawa          PLIM. PST.3.SB see
                 Dad saw Kaawa.                                          (transitive, explicit object)
  ( 2)           [Kaawa]A [ wune] T de                    dpJ.
                 Kaawa    already PLIM. PST.3.SB fall.asleep
                 Kaawa has already fallen asleep.                                       (intransitive)
   The Ergative-Absolutive system is also illustrated by the way in which indefinite status
(in Chafe' s terms (1976: 38- 43)) is marked. The numeral ngme 'one' is used to mark an
indefinite item in Yele. When the subject of a transitive verb (the Ergative referent) is
indefinite, ngme is added to the noun phrase:
  (3)            [ U dpodo pyu          ngme   nge] E a          nuwo.
                 his work performer INDEF SG.E CLS took. REM
                 One of his workers brought it.
  When the Absolutive referent of the clause is indefinite, this is signalled by prefixing
ngme- or a form derived from it to the predicate prenucleus. Example (4) illustrates this
phenomenon, for an indefinite object, the saw blade:
   (4)           [Saw nt:u] A ngme-nJ                     nuwo.
                 saw body INDEF-PI.REM. l SG.SB took. REM
                 I took a (circular) saw blade.
   If the (Absolutive) subject of an intransitive verb is indefinite, this also causes the
predicate prenucleus to be marked with ngme or a form derived from it:
  (5)            [ Yell PllA     [k.·ook ngme-doo                        dpodo.
                 Rossel person inside INDEF-CI.REM.3SG.SB working
                 There was a Rossel man working on board.
  The morpheme ngme and the forms derived from it are dealt with in more detail in
§2.1. 7. 1.","[22, 23]"

1. 3 SECONDARY PHONEMES
   The founder of prosodic analysis, J.R. Firth (1948:4), rejected the ""tendency to use one
magic phoneme principle within a monosystemic hypothesis"" and applied the term 'prosody'
to a feature extending over more than one segment, such as the voicelessness of the [st]
sequence in English. Grimes (1969: 85-88) outlines the principle of regarding as a
simultaneous prosody any features which pertain to a larger unit than a single segment. In the
transformational mould, Goldsmith (1979) has proposed autosegmental phonology, in
which phonological entities are effective in separate tiers. For example, tones would be in a
separate tier from that covering the consonantal and vocalic segments of utterances. Other
scholars have applied autosegmental phonology to further phenomena, such as complex
segments, vowel harmony and nasalisation, as reported by Van der Hulst and Smith (1982).
I have followed these departures from monosystemic analysis and set up a distinction
between basic phonemes and secondary phonemes. My secondary phonemes are contrastive
modifications which can be handled most economically in a second system, and which can
extend over more than one segmental phoneme. They are analogous to the suprasegmentals
of traditional Phonemics, to Firth's and Grimes' prosodies and to the tiers of autosegmental
phonology. I use the term 'secondary phoneme' rather than 'prosody' as the latter term is the
equivalent in Generative Phonology of the traditional term 'suprasegmentals' (Schane
1973:14). Granting a second system of phonemes opens the door for a simpler and more
concise analysis, and leads naturally to an economical and effective arrangement of the
material to be covered in the primer with which speakers of Yele can learn to read their own
language (Henderson and Henderson 1978). The more basic phonemes are introduced first,
and then the secondary phonemes quickly expand the readers' capabilities.
   Turning now to the secondary phonemes of the Yele language, the eleven basic vowel
phonemes displayed in Table 1.1.1 are augmented by two secondary phonemes, length and
nasalisation. Length is readily accepted as a suprasegmental phoneme along with pitch and
stress in traditional Phonemics. Schane (1973: 14f) lists these three as prosodies. Pike
(1947: 63) regards only these three as suprasegmentals under the premise that only
""quantitative characteristics ... may serve as suprasegmental phonemes"". He also refers in a
bibliographical section to the work of many linguists, from those who regard various other
features as suprasegmentals to those who deny any structurally relevant distinction between
segmental and suprasegmental phonemes (Pike 1960/3:53). Thus length would be regarded
by most linguists as a suprasegmental or as a prosody, so I automatically count it with the
secondary phonemes in Yele. I also regard nasalisation as a secondary phoneme, as it can be
applied to eight of the basic vowel phonemes, and it constitutes alone a causative morpheme:
     [ta y�i]        it fell down
     [ta y�]         he made it fall
                                                                                             13   [ta pWi:]         it came out
   [ta pWJ::]        he made it come out
The secondary phoneme of nasalisation removes the need for a series of eight nasalised
vowels, and nasalisation is taught successfully in a single lesson in the Yele primer
(Henderson and Henderson 1 978: 22- 26).
   If simultaneous bilabial closure can be regarded as a secondary phoneme of consonants
analogous to length and nasalisation of vowels, then the seven simultaneous stops and
continuants demonstrated in Table 1. 2. 4 can be represented as the corresponding non-bilabial
consonants uttered with simultaneous bilabial closure. When prenasalised stops or those with
nasal release are uttered with sirniltaneous bilabial closure, the bilabial closure affects both
the stop and the nasal, as illustrated in Table 1. 2.5.

reference system. Verbs move in a bewildering array of modes and tenses, doubled by an all­
pervasive distinction in duration, and elaborated by the incorporation of deictics into the
verb. Analysis proves difficult, because many of these distinctions are expressed in
portmanteau morphemes, rather than by agglutination. Yele also shows the
monofocallpolyfocal distinction found in some New Guinea Highland languages.
   The order of terms in the clause is SOV. Within the predicate, a modified norninative­
accusative system operates, but the items predicated in the clause follow ergative marking.
The ergative marker used with singular Agents, nge, is homophonous with the Instrument
marker, as in a number of Huon Peninsula languages.","[20, 21, 22]"

40   Haiman ( 1 979:898) has subjected Young ' s analysis to resegmentation to highlight firstly
the occurrence of a glottal stop in dual modal suffixes and secondly the identical marking of
first person plural and second person singular. He points out that these two features are
typical of a number of languages of the Eastern New Guinea Highlands Stock. It is
interesting to note the identity of second and third person dual prenuclei in Yele in continuous
non-proximal tenses (Table 2. 1 .5.3) and with punctiliar habitual forms (Table 2. 1 .5 .2). This
identity does not extend to the first person dual forms, however. Another point to note is that
where languages of the Eastern New Guinea Highlands Stock have the same modal suffix
for second person singular and first person plural, Yele has the same prenuclear component
for second person singular and first person dual in continuous habituals, immediate past and
immediate future indicatives (Table 2. 1 .5.3) and in punctiliar indicatives other than those in
the immediate past tense (Table 2. 1 .5.2).","[47, 48]"

can easily be seen. With the third person objects, dual and plural are nearly always marked
with forms containing d and t respectively.
( 1 ) Monofocal versus polyfocal subject    Many of the forms show a consistent pattern where for any number of object, one form is
used if the subject is first person or singular, and a different form is used with other subjects.
The forms used with a third person object and indicative proximal events or with punctiliar
habituals provide an example of this phenomenon. If the subject is first person or singular,
the postnucleus is @ for a singular object, de for a dual object or te for a plural obj ect. For
subjects other than first person or singular, however, the corresponding forms are ngme,
d:oo and t:oo respectively. Deibler ( 1 964:23) and Young ( 1 964:47-49 and 1 97 1 :22-23) have
termed these monofocal and polyfocal forms in describing Gahuku and B ena-bena
respectively, Papuan languages of the New Guinea Highlands. Table 2 . 1 .6.3 highlights this
phenomenon, showing how a third person plural object is affected by the person and number
                                           ,
of the subject in 'X ate them (yesterday) .","[45, 46, 47]"

"( 1 ) Presence of explicit subjects and objects
    Since the prenuclear and postnuclear components of the Yele verb mark the subject and
object of the predication so fully, these referents are frequently not specified by nouns or
noun phrases. Typically, they are made explicit where they enter a discourse, or where the
referents change, and elsewhere are carried just by the markers in the verb. For example, text
(a) in §2.4 introduces the author in the verbal prenucleus of clause 1 , and thereafter his
identity is carried by the verbal markers. He introduces his brother Nkal by name in clause
6a, and the quote formulae in their conversation keep track of the speakers. Nkal refers to
fish with a noun in 6c. Third person objects are introduced with nouns in clause l Ob 'I didn't
see anyone' and 1 1 b 'I chewed some betel nut' . The author refers to his father with a kin
58term in 1 2c, and quotes h i s father' s use o f h i s own name in 1 3b. H i s father also mentions
fish with a noun, in 1 5b.","[65, 66]"

2.2. 1 CA SE RELATIONSHIPS
( 1 ) Ergative and Absolutive
   The Ergative-Absolutive system operating within the clause has been introduced in §2. 1
(see examples 1 to 5). The modified Nominative-Accusative system operating within the
verb has been described in §2. 1 .5 and §2. 1 .6. This agreement is illustrated again briefly in
examples ( 1 46) and ( 1 50).
   With transitive verb roots the verbal prenucleus agrees in person and number with the
Ergative item, the subject of the clause. (See the tables in §2. 1 .5 . ) The postnucleus agrees
primarily with the Absolutive item, the object of the clause, but it also monitors the subject to
some degree. (See the tables in §2. 1 .6.) Examples ( 1 46a) to ( 1 46e) illustrate this agreement.

                    Kaawa and family saw them.                      (plural Subject, plural Object)     Note in examples ( 1 46b) and ( 1 46d) that the singular Subject of a transitive verb is
marked with nge. The non-singular form of the Ergative marker is y:oo, as in examples
( 1 46c) and ( 1 46e). In example ( 1 46a) the Ergative marking is overridden by the
accompaniment morpheme, k:ii.
     It is not required that the entity carrying the Ergative marker <ngb be animate:

                    It' s the soil that makes (the banana tree) bear fruit.
   With intransitive verb roots the verbal prenucleus agrees in person and number with the
subject of the clause. The postnucleus also agrees with the subject, but only in number.
Examples ( 1 50a) and ( 1 50b) illustrate this agreement briefly. (See §2. 1 .5 and §2. 1 .6 for the
details in full.)

  When a non-singular third person Absolutive item is specified by a numeral or other
quantitative word, it takes singular agreement in the verb.

(7) Transitive verb tense marking
    Turning now to the equivalent transitive verb 'hide something', the punctiliar root is
ngmo, while ngm:aa is used with continuous aspect. The transitive forms use the same
prenuclei as the intransitive predicates do, but the postnuclei are different. While intransitive
postnuclei divide first by duration then by mood and tense and finally by the number of the
subject (see Table 2. 1.6.1), transitive postnuclei divide first on the person of the object, then
on duration, mood and tense and finally on the number of the object and the person and
number of the subject. (See Table 2. 1.6.2.) The postnuclei are discussed in detail in §2.1.6.
Table 2.1.3.3 gives the transitive equivalents of the forms in Table 2.1.3. 1, for instances
with third person plural subject and third person singular object (such as 'They will be hiding
it').",[32]

   The last relator, k:oo, is interesting in that it cannot take any dependent pronoun between a
singular noun and the postposition, and for anaphoric reference when the noun is left
implicit, the postposition is used alone.

762.2.4 WORD CLASS DERIVATION
   Yele has several mechanisms for deriving a word of one class from a word of another
class.
     Adverbs can be derived from verbs or adjectives by the addition of -mbiy:e.                dpodo     -- >   dpodo-mbiy:e
                work             work-adverbialiser
                                 strongly                d:umu     -->    d:ud:u-mbiy:e
                full             full-adverbialiser
                                 fully(D:ud:u is a partial reduplication of d:umu ' full'.)
  A class of words meaning ' for the nth time' is derived from the ordinal numerals by the
addition of -mM.
                pyoio     -- >   pyoio-mM
                three.times      for the third time                podo      -- >   podo-mM
                four. times      for the fourth time
    Adjectives can be nominalised by suffixing with -ni 'specifier' to form a word meaning
' the . . . one ' .
                ndfi      -- >   ndfi-ni
                big              big-SPEC
                                 the big one
                tMe       -->    tMe-ni
                small            small-SPEC
                                 the small one
     Although the doer of an action is usually expressed by the addition of a separate word,
pyu, some words form contractions to indicate the person associated with an item.
                dpodo     -->    dpodo pyu

                                          man with big gardens, so plenty food
                    ndapf      --   >     ndaa-pi

                                          rich man
2.3 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PREDICATIONS  Predications can be linked by co-ordination or by subordination, depending on the
semantic relationship between them. The semantic relations are taken from Beekman et. al.

2.1.1 DURATION
  Bickerton has drawn attention to the primacy of duration in the development of language:
         ... all the evidence suggests that punctual-nonpunctual was the first TMA
         distinction to be grammaticised, and accordingly, the form that marked the
         distinction would have been juxtaposed to the main verb. (1981: 284)    In Yele, the duration of the event is the most important dichotomy affecting the predicate.
It is an all-pervasive dichotomy, affecting the verb root that is selected in a particular
16instance, and also the prenuclear and postnuclear components of the predicate used in that
instance. The dichotomy is similar to Comrie's perfective-imperfective dichotomy:
        ... perfectivity indicates the view of a situation as a single whole, without
        distinction of the various separate phases that make up that situation; while the
        imperfective pays essential attention to the internal structure of the situation.
        (1976: 1 6)  It seems better in Yele, however, to retain the terms 'punctiliar' and 'continuous', to avoid
any suggestion that Yele has a Perfect tense. Furthermore, Yele maintains the continuous­
punctiliar distinction in the habitual mood as well as the indicative, but Comrie's scheme
appears to regard habituals as necessarily imperfective (1976: 25, Table 1).
     Examples ( 6) and (7) illustrate the effects of duration on Yele predications.

                 They were working hard (today).                 (continuous intransitive)
   Most Yele verbs have both continuous and punctiliar roots, such as the verb 'break' in
example (6), where p wapl is the continuous root, and pwaa is a punctiliar root. Example (6a)
describes a momentary action, while example ( 6b) describes an activity with focus on its
duration. Kpee in (7a) is a punctiliar root, describing the complete action of washing. Its
continuous equivalent is kuku.

   Since most verbs have both punctiliar and continuous roots, the speaker can choose to
represent each event in a continuous or punctiliar form, as illustrated by the next two
examples.

                 but I didn't kill it (lit. didn't take its life).
                                                                                              17   Despite all the hitting with the bushknife (ni vyee in (9», the shark resisted the
fisherman's attempts to kill it. In contrast, quick death came with a single blow in vya 'hit' in
example (10):
   (10) a.     [Ke kn:aa ngeh m,
               pole butt   I      hit. REM

               He hit (his nephew) with the butt of the pole,
               cut his neck,
               and took up his head.
   The continuous root of a verb is also used as a nominal item, to name the event. When
used this way, the object affected by the event can be made explicit, but the Agent of the
action cannot be specified. Examples (11) and (12) below illustrate the verb 'hit', whose
punctiliar root is vy:a and whose continuous root is vyee. In example (12), vyee is used as a
nominal item. (Examples (11) and (12) can be seen in their wider context in text (a) in §2. 4,
where they are sentences 9 and l Oa respectively.)
   (11)        [ U kuwo dini ghi      ngeJ T w-a-nyi             vy:a.
               its after time piece Time D-FUT- 2SG.SB hit
               After that you ram it (the copra).
   (12)        [ U vyee    tedel L [lan:il1A w-a -nyi           ghodo, ...
               its hitting place coconut D-FUT- 2SG.SB gather
               You carry the copra to its ramming place...
   In example (12), the object of vyee is expressed pronominally, so the third person
singular possessive form is used. A noun as object is illustrated in example (13):
   (13)        [Mbweme pipi       tedelL n:aa                    Jepi.
               pig        eating place CI. IM.FUT. l SG.SB going
               I'm going to the pig feast.
   Although most Yele verbs have both punctiliar and continuous roots, a small set of
continuous intransitive verb roots have no punctiliar counterparts. The root dpodo 'working'
in example (7b) is one such root. Some others are:
  kmaapi       dining
  mbe          crying
  ng:aa        listening
   When the speaker wishes to portray such a continuous event with a punctiliar aspect,
referring to the event in its entirety, he can punctiliarise it with mb:ane 'do punctually'.
   (14)        [A               kaJs de                 ng:aa      mb:ane.

               He obeyed me (lit. listened to me).
  To portray the inception of a continuous event, the continuous verb root is used with the
appropriate form of pwapi 'breaking'.
18     (15)        [Mbe]A a       puwa.
                 crying CLS broke.REM
                 He started (lit. broke out) crying (before yesterday).
   There is a small set of verbs of motion in which the punctiliar root is used to portray an
event actually taking place at the moment of speech, or an event soon to take place. The fact
that a punctiliar root is used in the domain of the continuous is marked by an anomalous set
of predicate postnucIei:
     singular subject:      kni         (normally used with PL PRX.DU.SB)
     dual subject:          knopwo      (normally used with PLREM.DU.SB)
     plural subject:        dniye       (normally used with PLREM.PL.SB)
  The punctiliar roots most commonly used in a continuous way are kee 'come/go up/in'
whose normal continuous equivalent is koko 'coming/going up/in', 166 'cross over' (normal
continuous equivalent 166160) and pwiye 'come', for which I have never heard a continuous
equivalent. The following examples illustrate the fact that kee, 166 and pwiye are essentially
punctiliar roots:
     (16) a.     [NkeiJ] A [mw:aandiyeh da                           kee.

  The following examples illustrate the use of these punctiliar roots with continuous force,
marked by the anomalous predicate postnucIei.

provided adequately by the context.

(2) Specifier
  The Head noun of the phrase can be specified by a deictic, a question word or a
comparative expression. When this happens, many nouns take on a ' specified' form, others
remain unchanged, as in example (2 1 9).
     (2 1 9) a .    k6pu
                    word
                    word

                    that word
                    that word
   Some of the nouns which show this specification do so by having -ni suffixed to them, as
                                                    ,
in example (220), while others change to a specified form, as in examples (22 1 ) and (222).
                                                          •

                    a person like my father
     When -ni is suffixed, some nouns change their form somewhat.
     (22 1 ) a.     nte           -->    16       nti-ni ?
                    food                 which food-SPEC

                    that message
   Many nouns change their basic form when specified, without showing much resemblance
to -ni.

an associated kin term.

                  Mgeedi ASS.wife
                  Mgeedi and his wife
   Where the Head can be inferred from the context, the accompanying kin term can stand
alone.
   ( 227)         [Cha]A            [noko] M dpi-mo                              yey.

                  The man and his wife were arguing.
(4) Quantifier
   The Head of a noun phrase can be quantified either by a number marker or by a numeric
expression. The Quantifier follows the noun. Two number markers are used, de for dual
items and yoo for plural animate items.
   ( 22 8)        [U kpfim de              Y:OO] E [u   ngomO] A kpemi ng6pu.

                  woman PL     run    IT.PI.REM . S G . S B
                  The women ran away.
74   Note in example (229) that the quantifier yoo on the Absolutive item, the women, forces
singular agreement in the verb.","[79, 80, 81, 82]"
"   With transitive verbs in the remote past tense where the object is third person singular and
the subject is monofocal (i.e. first person or singular), strong verbs use the strong root with
zero postnucleus (56c), but weak verbs use the normal punctiliar root or the ' followed' root
as appropriate (see ' Paranoid' verbs above) with a postnucleus of nge (57c).
Strong transitive verb:   (56) a .   De                  vy:a.

              stand.up.FOL PLREM . 3 SG.O.MF
              He stood it up (before yesterday).
(8) Interaction between duration and transitivity
   While transitive verbs are generally distinct from intransitive verbs, and both can be either
continuous or punctiliar, there is a small set of verbs in which there is an interaction between
transitivity and duration. The verb 'writelcarve' is a suitable example of the verbs in this set.
The transitive verb d:ee 'write something' is completely regular, using the root d:ee for all
punctiliar predications (58 a), and the reduplicated form d:eed:ee for all continuous
predications (58b). The intransitive verb 'writing ' , however, is also d:ee, but in this case the
root is continuous (58c). As is to be expected, the intransitive form shows focus on the
event, with no way of specifying the object being carved or written. There is no punctiliar
intransitive verb 'write' .

                 CI.REM.3PL . SB writing
                 They were writing (before yesterday).                     (continuous intransitive)(9) Existential verb root selection
   As mentioned above, there are two existential verbs which have suppletive roots. They
have the meanings 'be sitting' and 'be standing' . The third existential verb, 'be hanging' , has
only one root, t:a. Existential predications in Yele must use one of these three verbs, which
must agree with the class of the participant acting as subject of the predication (i.e. the entity
whose existence is asserted) . The classes are predominantly semantic: trees and mountains
stand, people and shell coins sit while boats and roads hang. Of course the newcomer to
Rossel Island finds some seeming anomalies, such as
     (59)        [Ngwolo deJA daa                         kwo       mo.

"(2) Natural topic hierarchy
   The effect of the natural topic hierarchy (see Dixon 1 976:7f, 1 1 2-200) can be seen in
Table 2. 1 .6.2, in that first and second person objects are important enough for the free
pronouns to have a strong influence on the predicate postnuclei used with these objects. With
third person objects, however, the person and number of the subject are increasingly
important, until the point is reached in the last three lines of Table 2 . 1 .6.2, where for third
person singular objects of punctiliar imperatives, the person and number of the subject are
almost completely distinguished.",[48]

listed in Table 2. 1 .7.5. 1 . It is the response to the question 'Why did people stop my son
collecting fIreflies?' (To Rossel people, fIreflies embody spirits of the dead.)   (95) a.    Njimi, [na a ka]G yed:oo [ill!!                kopu u diY:O] Reason , -

                 I think that is the reason.
   As listed in Table 2. 1 . 7 . 5 . 1 , ala and mu have cataphoric reference when used i n
discourse, and wu and yi have anaphoric reference. Discussion with the speaker o f this text,
Raymond, confirmed that ala used in clause (95a) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (c) and (d), and that its use in clause (g) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (h) and (i). He also said that mu in clause (h) referred to the following REASONs in
clauses (h) and (i). Mu seems to be used here rather than ala, because it introduces another
following REASON, as mu is used as a deictic to refer to an 'other' entity. When asked
about yi in clause U), he said it referred to all the previous REASONs. Concerning wu in
(96a) and (96c), he said it referred to the earlier pair of REASONs in (95c) and (95d). There
is a parallel here between the real-world usage of wu to refer to an entity which is out of
sight. The earlier pair of preceding REASONs is 'out of sight' compared with the later pair
of preceding REASONs.
   Five of these deictics have parallels in the predicate prenucleus with similar meanings. For
example, the basic form of the certainty prefix is Ja''.., and its typical use is to indicate that the
speaker was an eyewitness to an event. While kJ- and its variants are used with non-future
indicative events, future indicatives (that is events that have not been ' seen' yet) can be
marked with w- 'definiteness' in the same position in the predicate prenucleus.
( 1 ) Incorporating the deictic kJ
   The incorporation of the other deictics is described in detail below, but first let us examine
kJ- and W-. The basic form kJ- merges into the predicate prenucleus. In the present tense of
continuous events, it takes the form k-, and is used only with third person subjects.

       kJ + nmJ --> kunu
       kJ + dpJ    --> kudu

       kJ remains unchanged elsewhere.

   Yele ( also referred to as Yela and Yeletnye) is spoken by about 3,300 people, the
inhabitants of Rossel Island in the Milne B ay Province of Papua New Guinea. It is non­
Austronesian, sharing only 6 per cent of cognates with the nearest Austronesian language,
Sudest. (See Henderson and Henderson 1 974.) No close relatives of Yele have been
identified.
   This monograph describes the phonology and grammar of the language, highlighting the
portmanteau orthography and portmanteau interaction of tense, mood and aspect i n
predications. The grammatical description is b y prose statements, the analytical insights
being drawn mainly from Tagmemics and Functional Grammar (Dik 1 978).
  A preliminary description of the Yele language was published in 1 975 ( Henderson 1 975).","[2, 3, 4, 5]"
"   Is it purely coincidence that the predicate postnucleus used with a third person singular
object with polyfocal subject (such as in example (74» is ngme? It is hardly a coincidence
that the numeral 'one' used in counting is also ngme.

"  Source/Goal has a locative use, when someone uses a person' s name as the destination to
which he is going or the place he has come from.

   There is a set of intransitive verbs which take as Goal objects that are affected by the
action of the verb. These objects at first seem to be the objects of transitive verbs, but the use
of ka to mark them and the verb morphology show that Yele regards them as the Goals of
intransitive verbs instead.

  These verbs were mentioned at the start of §2. 1 .4 under noun incorporation, because
when one of these verbs incorporates its Goal, the Goal marker ka is also incorporated. See
examples (43) to (45).
   A non-singular third person Source or Goal is marked with yeo

2. 1 .7 SECONDARY FACTORS   That brings to a close the discussion of the basic structures in the predicate. There are a
number of other factors which affect the predicate, all of which have been left unmanifested
in §§ 2. 1 .4, 2. 1 .5 and 2. 1 .6, to keep the complexity of the presentation within manageable
proportions. The following sections will deal with these factors in turn. Some forms of the
morphemes that manifest these factors can be seen easily enough as affixes, but others are
merged into the prenucleus, with confusing results. The factors are as follows, their basic
forms being listed along with them.
     - indefiniteness                ngme­          ( § 2 . 1 .7 . 1 )
     - commonality                   mye            ( §2 . 1 . 7 . 2)
     - repetition                    me             (§2. 1 .7.3)
     - motion                        n:aa           ( §2 . 1 .7 .4)
     - deictic incorporation         various        ( §2 . 1 . 7 . 5 )
     - negation                      daa            ( § 2 . 1 . 7 . 6)
     - contrafactual status          wo. . .pi      ( § 2 . 1 .7.7)
2. 1 .7. 1 INDEFINITENESS
     Where the Absolutive referent of a predication i s indefinite, i n Chafe ' s terms
( 1 976:38-43), this is signalled by prefixing <ngme-> to the predicate prenucleus. The saw
blade in example (65) illustrates an object which is indefinite:
     (65)      [Saw nt:u]A ngme-ni            nuwo.
               saw body INDEF-PI.REM. 1 SG.SB took.REM
               I took a (circular) saw blade.
                                                                                               41   If the subject of an intransitive verb is indefinite, this also causes the predicate prenucleus
to be marked with <ngmo.
   (66)        [N:uU]A ngme        loo?
               who    INDEF went
               Who went?","[48, 49]"
"
2.1.3 TENSE
   In the indicative mood, six tenses are distinguished for continuous events, but only four
for punctiliar events. Punctiliar verb roots cannot be manifested in the immediate future and
present tenses.
   This section outlines the ways in which the tenses are distinguished. Sections 2. 1. 4 to
2.1. 6 give further details.
                                                                                                21(1) Future tense   In the indicative mood, future prenuclear components are prefixed with a - 'future' and
optionally with w- 'definite situation'. (See §2. 1.7.S also.)
   (22) a.     W-a -dnyi                  mbwollmbwoli.
               D -FUT-CI.DST. 3PL.SB hiding
               They (plural) will be hiding (tomorrow).                            (continuous)
          b.   W-a     mbwoll dmi.
               D-FUT hide       IT. PI.PRX. PL.SB
               They (plural) will hide (tomorrow).                                  (punctiliar)
   The future tense with continuous events covers the period tomorrow and later, but with
punctiliar events, it covers any time after the present moment. It is also used with a second
person singular subject to express a general procedure that people follow.
   (23)        [DYUU]A a -nyi-ne                   pyidu  t6.
               heap       FUT- PI. 2SG.SB- CLS stand. up T.IND. PRX. 3PL. O.MF
               One gathers them (coconuts) into heaps.                (text (b), clause 2c)
               (lit. You (singular) will stand up heaps.)
(2) Immediate future versus present tense
   Immediate future and present forms with third person subjects usually can not be
distinguished:
  (24)         A                         mbwollmbwoll t6.
               CI.PRES/IM.FUT.3.SB hiding             IT. CI. PRX. PL.SB
               They are/will soon be hiding.                                       (continuous)
   Some people, however, mark continuous indicative present tense intransitive verbs with
third person singular subjects by changing the postnucleus from the usual 0 to ne ( 2Sa).
Similarly, equative statements are sometimes marked with ne (2Sb).
  ( 2S) a.     [Daa yoo      ngmiffil A [y:llL a                kwo
               NEG group one           there CI. PRES. 3.SB standing
               ne.
               IT. CI. PRES. 3SG. SB
               There are many groups of people there.
               (A characteristic Yele understatement - lit. Not one group is standing there.)          b.   [Gregory hop [ala ne] cOM .
               Gregory        here PRES
               Gregory is here.
Punctiliar events do not occur with present or immediate future tense, as stated above.
   With first and second person subjects, present and immediate future forms can be
distinguished:
   (26) a.     N:aa                   mbwollmbwoll.
               CI. IM.FUT. l SG.SB hiding
               I'll be hiding soon.                                          (immediate future)
22              b.   A-ni                 mbwolimbwoli.
                   CLPRES- l SG.SB hiding
                   I'm hiding (at this moment).                                          (present)
   Present tense forms are rare. The immediate future is frequently used for events that are
actually happening as well as for events that will happen soon.
(3) Immediate past and near past tenses
   The prenuclear components of immediate past and near past predicates are in a reciprocal
relationship with duration. The immediate past continuous prenuclei (27) are identical with
the near past punctiliar prenuclei (28). The immediate past punctiliar prenuclei have a stop
feature added to them (de in (29)), and the near past continuous prenuclei used with third
person subjects also contain a stop feature (dnyi in (30)):
     ( 27)         Nmi                  mbwolimbwoli teo
                   CI.IM.PST. I PL.SB hiding         IT.C LPRX. PL.SB
                   We were hiding (earlier today).             (continuous immediate past)
     ( 2 8)        Nmi                  mbwoli dmi.

     (29)          De                  mbwoli dmi.
                   PI. IM.PST. 3. SB hide     IT.PL PRX.PL.SB
                   They hid (earlier today).                           (punctiliar immediate past)
     (30)          Dnyi                  mbwolimbwoli.
                   CLNR. PST.3PL.SB hiding
                   They were hiding (yesterday).                           (continuous near past)
   Near past tense is used for events that happened yesterday. Immediate past is used for
events that happened 'earlier today', but also for punctiliar events that took place earlier than
today, even into the far past, if the present effects of the events are in focus (Comrie' s
'perfect'). I n example (31) below, the fire was into the domain of the remote past by the time
the news travelled right around Rossel, but the news is conveyed in the immediate past to
show that its effects remain.
     (31) a.       [Pi    yint6mu Y:OO] E ny:ee ng6pu,
                   person all       PL.E   hear   T.PL REM. 3SG.O.PF

                   they.said N: iiii Teepwe their home
              C.   ape,      [NdapiJ A     [nde nge] E de                   mao
                   they.said shell.money fire SG.E PI.IM.PST. SG. SB eat
                   Everyone heard that at N:aa and Teepwe's village fire had destroyed the shell
                   money.
(4) Discourse function of immediate past tense
   In a narrative set in the remote past, the immediate past is used for several punctiliar
clauses at the climax of the narrative, if the emotive content of the story warrants it. (Many
stories are told without any shift to the immediate past.) For example, in Gregory Mepe""s
narrative of his trip to Port Moresby and years of work there, he switches to the immediate
past at the point where he is met at the wharf and taken to the place where he is to live and
                                                                                              23work. In Kadawa's story of a trip to T:am for a bride-price ceremony, she switches to the
immediate past for the distribution of the shell wealth, then back to the remote past again.
This switch seems to mark the focus of the story. It is signalled by using a continuous future
prenucleus with a punctiliar verb root and postnucleus.
   (32)            [ Teetee mbwemi   kni  Y:OO] E ­

                   My uncles cut the (rope of) shell money.
  Longacre (1972: 135f) reports a similar tense shift marking the climaxes of legends in Fore
and Waffa, Highland languages of Papua New Guinea.
(5) Remote past tense
   The one tense remaining to be described here is the remote past - events that took place
before yesterday.
   (33) a.         Dnye              mbwolimbwoli.
                   CLREM. 3PL.SB hiding
                   They were hiding (before yesterday).               (continuous remote past)
           b.      Mbwoli dniye.

                   They hid (before yesterday).                        (punctiliar remote past)
(6) System of tense relationships
   The third person examples above that involve mbwolimbwoli 'hiding' are repeated
without glosses in Table 2.1.3.1 to facilitate comparison.","[28, 29, 30, 31]"
"
2.3.2.4 NOM INALIS ATION
  A further degree of subordination of one predication to another is shown in the
nominalisation of a verb, in which the continuous root is used as a noun. An object affected
by the nominalised predication can be expressed, but the Agent of the action cannot be
expressed.
                                                                                             85   (266)        lEi    pip.i]A [ wunel T kJ ye ng6pu.

roots.","[92, 93]"

third syllable.

  [tQbug�fa]          crocodile
   Reduplicated words longer than two syllables are phonologically two words, because
voiceless allophones are found at the beginning of the reduplication, as are found word­
initially. (See Table 1.1.15.) Although the longer reduplicated words are phonologically
separate words, they function grammatically as single words, so they are written as single
words in the practical orthography.",[13]

                      [pje]    lean against                  [puo]        started it   Sequences of a higher vowel followed by a lower vowel are interpreted as vowel­
semivowel-vowel, to avoid a sequence of vowels. Thus two items of Table 1.1.13 are
interpreted as follows:
    [pie]       is interpreted as   piye      lean against
    [pgo]       is interpreted as   PUW8      started it
   By analogy, sequences of [i] followed by a lower vowel are interpreted as having [y]
between the [i] and the lower vowel:
    [k!a]       is interpreted as   kigha ripe
    [k!:G]      is interpreted as   kight grandfather
   This interpretation is supported by dialect variation. The eastern dialect word [k!e] kighe
'lizard type' corresponds in the western dialect with [ki�e] kike. Further evidence for the
interpretation was found by dictation testing. I asked the test subjects to dictate test words
slowly so I could write them, breaking the words into syllables. Words such as [k!e] 'bite'
                                                                                               5were dictated as [lei - j£] rather than as [ki - £] or [k!£]. Furthermore, people who had
been taught to write [i] as f and [y] as gh wrote words such as [lc!a] 'ripe' as kigha, thus
filling the gap in the distribution of [i] and [y], in that [y] never follows [i] in speech.
  The remaining vowel sequences are �i], �i], �i] and @i]. These are interpreted as oy, ey,
ey and ay respectively. For example, [y�i] 'fall' is interpreted as ghay. Table 1.1.14 shows
these sequences in contrast with plain vowels.","[12, 13]"

   The verb ' give' is a special case, as the verb root used depends on the person of the
recipient (Goal) . Perhaps it should be regarded as two different verbs, ' give to a third
person' and ' give to a first or second person ' . Table 2. 1 .4.5 outlines the different roots
meaning ' give' that are used.

     The main factors affecting the predicate prenucleus are:
         - duration       continuous or punctiliar (see §2. 1 . 1 above)
         - mood           indicative, habitual or imperative (see §2. 1 .2)
         - tense          six tenses in the indicative mood and two in each of habitual and
                          imperative moods (see §2. 1 . 3)
         - person         first, second or third person subject
         - number         singular, dual or plural subject
   The interactions of these parameters are marked by portmanteau morphemes related to the
pronouns, as presented in Tables 2. 1 .5.2 and 2. 1 .5 . 3 below, with following discussion.
That discussion defers consideration of a number of other factors which affect the
prenucleus, such as negation, contrafactual status, motion, included deictics and reference to
one of several objects. All these factors are such that they are only expressed in certain
situations and so to simplify the description of the predicate prenucleus, the forms where
these factors are not expressed will be used in this section. (These factors are described in
detail in §2. 1 .7.)
   The Yele free pronouns are presented in Table 2. 1 .5 . 1 , for comparison with the prenuclei
in Tables 2. 1 . 5 .2 and 2. 1 .5.3.","[41, 42]"

"
2. 1. 2 MOOD
   I am using the term ' mood' to refer to a fuzzy parameter along which Yele makes three
structural distinctions, based on the type of speech act and the specificity of the action. These
distinctions are marked in the verbal prenucIeus and postnucIeus, and even affect the verb
root with some verbs. From the perspective of speech act, Yele makes only one major
distinction, namely that between informational speech and commands. Questions use the
same verb roots and exactly the same prenucIear and postnuclear components as do
                                                                                               19statements. Imperatives differ markedly in form from statements and questions. (Yes-no
questions differ from statements in intonation, and content questions contain a question
word. Otherwise they are the same as statements.) Thus Yele distinguishes morphologically
between informational speech and imperatival speech.
   Within informational speech, Yele distinguishes between reference to specific events in
the past, present or future, as opposed to habitual events that people perform. The reference
to specific events is termed the indicative mood in this paper, while the reference to habitual
events is the habitual mood. Table 2. 1.2. 1 shows these distinctions diagrammatically.","[26, 27]"

   There are eleven contrastively different vowels in Yele. Vowel length and nasalisation are
also contrastive. Consonants have four points of articulation: bilabial, dental, post-alveolar
and velar. They are articulated as stops, nasal continuants, non-nasal continuants and
semivowels. The stops can also be prenasalised or uttered with nasal release. All but two of
the non-bilabial consonants can be uttered with simultaneous bilabial closure. Palatalisation
and labialisation are also contrastive, and even occur simultaneously when attached to bilabial
stops and nasals. This mouthful of contrasts adds up to 38 different vowel sounds and 56
different consonantal sounds to listen for.
  The analytical model u sed is traditional phonemics (Pike 1947), adj usted to allow
secondary phonemes analogous to suprasegmentals or Firth' s prosodies ( Palmer 1970).
The IPA set of phonetic characters is used in this description, and in words of more than one
syllable the stressed syllable is underlined. [j] and [w] represent semivowels. No strictly
phonemic transcriptions are used, because of the difficulty in symbolising simultaneous
bilabial closure in a meaningful way. Semi-phonemic transcriptions are given in italics, using
the practical alphabet that has arisen as a result of this study and which is now in use
amongst the Rossel Island people.","[8, 9]"

2.3.3 QUOTATIONS
   All quotations are direct. There is no indirect speech. Every utterance by the one person is
introduced by a quote formula which specifies when the words were spoken, and the person
and number of the speaker and of the hearer. Typically, each succeeding clause in the
quotation is introduced by a contracted quote formula that gives the person and number of the
speaker and of the person spoken to, and the tense.   (267) a .    [Hughie nge] E ye-pe,

   Another example of dialogue is at text (a), sentences 6 and 7 in §2.4. In sentence 8 of that
text the two following clauses in the quotation are not preceded by the contracted quote
formula, a -ka -de ' he said to me' . It is obvious that the quotation continues, because of the
second person verb parts. This text was originally written, not spoken, and there is a
tendency in written material not to use the quote formulae as frequently as in spoken
discourse.
   Quoted speech is common in narrative, but rare in procedural, hortatory or explanatory
discourse types. Text (d) in §2.4 is explanatory, and contains quoted speech in an embedded
narrative episode (sentences 10 to 1 6) .

straightforward, such as p for the bilabial stop and k for the velar stop. Others required some
care. For example, t was chosen to represent the dental phoneme and d to represent the post­
alveolar phoneme, because some Rossel people were already writing these sounds this way,
and because the post-alveolar stop is partially voiced word medially adjacent to a short vowel
and so it is similar to d in English. The digraph th was rejected by the Rossel people as a
representation for one of these phonemes, because the nearby Sudest language has [0] in its
inventory, and the Rossels did not want there to be any confusion with that sound. The
dental and post-alveolar nasals posed a problem, as the English alphabet does not provide
any equivalent in the nasals to t and d, so the acute accent used to mark close vowels was
borrowed and pressed into service to mark the dental nasal. The velar nasal is represented by
ng to match English usage. The velar fricative is represented on Goodenough Island by g,
but gh was chosen for the Yele orthography to avoid confusion with the symbols used for a
prenasalised velar stop uttered with simultaneous bilabial closure (mg).
  The non-dental stops are partially voiced word medially when adjacent to a short vowel.
For the post-alveolar stop, this results in a manifestation as [r] in that environment.

  There is a contrastive series of prenasalised stops, in which the speech power of the
prenasalisation is much greater than that of the stop. Hence they are referred to as the

contrasts are illustrated in Table 1.2.2.","[14, 15]"

61.2 CONSONANTS
  There are four points of articulation: bilabial, dental, post- alveolar and velar. The basic
manners of articulation are stops, nasal continuants, non- nasal continuants and two
semivowels, as illustrated in Table 1.2.1.","[13, 14]"
"        TABLE 2. 1. 2. 1: PARAMETERS ALONG WHICH YELE MOODS ARE DISTINGUISHED
                                         Specific                 Indicative mood              Informational        Specificity                                         Habitual                 Habitual mood      Speech act
                Command                                           Imperatival mood
   The term 'imperative' is used for first person and third person forms as well as for second
person forms, as imperatival forms with all three persons of subject share two features in
common:
   1 . All imperatival forms with punctiliar events have a tense distinction between
       commands or suggestions to be carried out immediately and those to be deferred
       until a later time. (See §2. 1. 3 below.)
   2. All immediate imperatival forms with punctiliar events have a zero prenucleus. (See
      Table 2. 1.5. 2 below.)
    The morphological differences between the moods are difficult to characterise, because of
the portmanteau representation of a number of parameters at once. The following examples
illustrate the differences. The details are presented in §2. 1A and §2. 1.5 below.

   Examples 2 0 and 21 show that, for punctiliar verbs, the postnucleus of the habitual is
identical to that of the indicative in the 'proximal' tenses. (See §2.1.3.) This is true for all
person and number categories of subject and object.","[27, 28]"
"(4) Reason
   Reason can be expressed at clause level with u (l:ee) dly:o 'on account of' . A dependent
pronoun is obligatory, but the morpheme 1:ee is optional . Its use seems to be a matter of
idiosyncratic style.

(5) Accompaniment
   The viewpoint is different from English in that Yele uses the accompaniment slot to
specify more explicitly the subject of a clause, and the verb agrees in number and person
with the combined party, from the speaker' s point of view.

motion, it is the location where the event takes place.","[76, 77]"

the predicate postnuc!eus.

'but' .

"(3) Incorporating the deictic ala
    The deictic ala ' this' (close to the speaker) has a parallel in a 'close ' , which occurs in the
predicate prenucleus to mark motion towards the speaker or proximity to the speaker.
Although the basic form is a, the morpheme takes a number of different forms, as presented
in the matrices A-7 and A-8 in the appendix. In some cases, a 'close' is added unchanged to
the 'unmarked' predicate prenucleus ( 1 04). (The added a is written as a separate word in the
practical orthography to avoid confusion with a long vowel within a morpheme. Where a
'close' is added, there is a pitch glide from the unmarked prenucleus down to the a, but this
does not occur with normal long vowels.)   ( 1 04) a.      [Maah      w-a       kee             dmi.

   On the paths at Rossel, the two sentences in ( 1 07) can be heard, where the vowel j is
lowered to a, as a mother encourages her young child not to dawdle along. Example ( 1 07a) is
used if the child is ahead of his mother on the path, while ( 1 07b) is used if he is following
her.

"   Example (39a) is typical of noun incorporation, while (39b) shows how the noun cannot
be incorporated if specified in some way, in this instance by a possessive pronoun.

   Many verbs with incorporated nouns represent ""activities recognized sufficiently often to
be considered name-worthy in their own right"" (Mithun 1 984:848). Some examples are:

B oth examples (4 1 ) and (42) incidentally also illustrate the incorporation of compound
nouns.
   While noun incorporation usually involves transitive verb roots, there is a small set of
intransitive verb roots which incorporate a Goal, along with the Goal marker, <ka>. Example
(43) shows the root vyu wo 'look' with its goal not incorporated, and (44) shows two goals
typically incorporated with this verb.

28   Example (45) below shows a verb with incorporated Goal, which does not occur in un­
incorporated form. It names the traditional activity of cooking food in a ground oven, which
has been replaced to quite some extent by cooking in store-bought pots. Perhaps in the past it
could be un-incorporated.","[34, 35, 36]"

2. 1 .6 THE PREDICATE POSTNUCLEUS
   In predicate postnuclei, transitivity is the primary dichotomy. Table 2. 1 .6. 1 shows the
postnuclei used with intransitive events. Note that intransitive postnuclei reflect first the
duration of the event, then its mood and tense and finally the number of the subject. The
person of the subject is monitored only in the postnucleus in imperatives.
