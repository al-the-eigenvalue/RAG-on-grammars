7      Clause and sentence structureIn this chapter, the most important aspects of simple and complex sentences in Movima are
described. Before going into details in the following sections, I want to point out some crucial
properties of Movima clause structure.
  First of all, Movima has a hierarchical alignment system. There is no case marking and no
agreement indicating grammatical relations. Word order is fixed, but it is semantically
determined: in a transitive clause, the participant higher in the animacy hierarchy is encoded
as the first core argument (ARG1) and the participant lower in the hierarchy is encoded as the
second core argument (ARG2). The semantic roles of the arguments are indicated by direct or
inverse voice marking on the verb, as described in 7.5. An effect of this system is an
ergativity split, since the alignment of grammatical relations and semantic roles is switched by
the voice markers (cf. 7.5.3).
  The fact that due to the hierarchical alignment system, grammatical relations are not
distinguished by case marking, agreement, or word order, makes it difficult to attach labels
such as “subject” and “object” to the syntactic positions. J. Judy (1965) uses these terms,
labelling the first argument in a transitive clause “subject” and the second argument “object”.
This, however, is a problem in inverse clauses, where, as Judy also points out, the second
argument encodes the agent.
  Moreover, it can be shown that if anything can be analysed as the subject in Movima, this is
not the first, but the second core argument, which represents the undergoer in a direct
transitive clause. This becomes apparent from the structure of relative clauses, described in
7.11. In addition, the second, but not the first core argument can be deleted in coordination,
which is also a criterion for subjecthood (cf. Keenan 1976). However, it may be misleading to
use the term “subject” for the second transitive argument, since it has some untypical
properties. In the direct construction, which can be seen as pragmatically less marked since it
indicates that the participant higher on the animacy hierarchy acts on the participant lower on
the hierarchy, the second argument encodes the undergoer. Also, this argument is not
obligatorily realized. To avoid confusion, I use the neutral terms ARGintr for the intransitive
argument, ARG1 for the first transitive argument, and ARG2 for the second transitive
argument. ARGintr and ARG2 are furthermore subsumed under the term “absolutive
argument”.
  Note, furthermore, that ARG1, the first argument in a transitive clause, is encoded in the
same way as the possessor (cf. 6.1).134
  This chapter is organized as follows. Sections 7.1–7.8 discuss constituent order, argument
encoding, and the assignment of semantic roles in affirmative main clauses. In Sections 7.9–
7.10, I describe affirmative main clauses with nonverbal predicates, as well as arguments that
contain a verb. In Section 7.11, relative clauses are described. Section 7.12 presents the main134
    The peculiarities of the Movima system outlined here may arise from the possibility that, at least historically,
all clauses are basically equational. Under this view, ARG1 represents a possessor, and the absolutive argument
represents the intransitive subject everywhere. This means that the proposition ‘I hit the dog’ would in Movima
be expressed as ‘my hitten one is the dog’. The term “subject” would be uncontroversial then. For an analysis of
other languages along these lines, see Sasse 1991.","[279, 280]"

1.9. Structural characteristics of Movima
Movima has many characteristics typical of Amazonian languages. I will compare it to the
features listed as typically Amazonian in Dixon & Aikhenvald (1999: 8f.).(a)    polysynthetic, head-marking, agglutinating with little fusion
       Movima is agglutinating, i.e., most morphemes have only one meaning, and displays a
       limited degree of fusion. It is head-marking in that one transitive argument as well as8
      possession are marked on the predicate or possessed noun, respectively. It is
      problematic to classify the language as polysynthetic, however. Polysynthetic features
      of Movima are that a clause can consist of the predicate alone, and that there is
      productive noun incorporation. However, while voice/valency and applicative
      categories are encoded by verbal morphology, tense, location, and direction (typical
      features of polysynthesis in Amazonian languages, cf. Payne 1990: 214) are not
      morphologically expressed on the verb, and person only to a limited degree.
      Moreover, Movima is syntactically fairly configurational (verb-initial), a feature
      untypical of polysynthetic languages.(b)   / / in the vowel inventory, contrastive nasalization of vowels
      Neither the central unrounded vowel [ ], nor contrastive nasalization of vowels exist in
      Movima. The five vowel phonemes are i, e, a, o, u.(c)   Extensive classifier and/or semantically based gender systems
      Movima has a semantically-based gender system, marked on the referential elements
      (articles, pronouns, demonstratives). This system is independent of the classifier
      system, which seems to have arisen through compounding and incorporation.(d)   Only few oblique cases
      Indeed, there is only one oblique case in Movima, marked by the prefix n- on the
      referential elements (articles and pronominal forms). Otherwise, case marking is
      absent.(e)   Possession marked on the possessed noun, not on the possessor; most widespread
      word order is ‘possessor possessed’
      Possession is marked on the possessed noun. Since the possessed noun is marked by
      an enclitic encoding the possessor, however, the word order is ‘possessed possessor’.(f)   Just one core argument cross-referenced on the verb
      This is true for Movima: the only core argument that is obligatorily cross-referenced is
      the transitive argument encoding the participant higher on the animacy hierarchy.(g)   ‘Split-ergative’ systems arise due to complex rules determining which core argument
      is cross-referenced on the verb
      A split-ergative pattern can indeed be observed in Movima, arising from the
      hierarchical alignment system: the transitive argument lower on the animacy hierarchy
      (in subordinate and negative clause, the argument higher on the hierarchy) is encoded
      like the intransitive argument, regardless of whether it is A or O.(h)   The bound pronominal forms marking a possessor within an NP are the same as one
      of the bound pronominal paradigms for marking core arguments of a clause
      This is indeed the case. The possessor is encoded in the same way as the first
      argument of a transitive clause, which is the only argument obligatorily encoded.","[31, 32]"

(i)    Most languages have prefixes, and there are fewer prefix than suffix positions
       There is only one “real” prefix in Movima, the oblique case marker n-. Other prefixes
       are reduplicated elements. Otherwise, Movima is mainly suffixing.(j)    (On typical order of prefixes)
       Does not apply: only one prefix (n- or a reduplicated element) can occur at a time.(k)    Most verbal categories (e.g. tense, aspect, modality, direction) are expressed through
       optional suffixes
       All these categories are expressed not by suffixes, but by optional particles in
       Movima, whose distribution in the clause is relatively free. Tense is, in addition, a
       nominal category, expressed by referential elements.(l)    Subordinate clauses typically involve nominalized verbs, the type of subordination
       being marked on the verb
       Indeed, subordination (as well as main-clause negation) always involves
       nominalization of the predicate. The type of subordination, however, is either not
       overtly indicated, or indicated by a particle preceding the subordinate clause.(m)    If there is noun incorporation, typically only those nouns which are obligatorily
       possessed can be incorporated, and they typically precede the verb root
       There are different types of productive noun incorporation, involving unpossessed
       nouns or body-part-terms. Apart form body-part terms, obligatorily possessed nouns
       cannot be incorporated. The incorporated nominal element follows the root.(n)    In many languages adverbs and adpositions may be incorporated into the verb
       This does not seem to be the case in Movima.(o)    There is generally only a small class of lexical numbers
       Indeed, there are only four number terms, from 1 to 4, and the terms for 1 and 4 seem
       to be morphologically complex (“no other” and “several times two,” respectively).","[32, 33]"

9     Complex verbal bases: incorporation and applicativesThe main characteristic of complex verbal bases is that they consist of several morphemes and
are subject to voice alternations (cf. 8.4). In this chapter, the different kinds of complex bases
are presented.
  The first part of this chapter deals with the two types of noun incorporation, argument
incorporation (cf. 9.1) and modifying incorporation (cf. 9.2). Argument incorporation, already
introduced in 7.7, is different from all other derivational processes described in this chapter,
since the resulting verb is automatically monovalent and does not participate in voice
alternations. It is described here in order to contrast it with modifying incorporation.
Modifying incorporation, like the processes described later in this chapter, creates a complex
base which undergoes voice and valency alternations (as characterized in Ch. 8).
  The other processes which create a complex base can be subsumed under the cover term of
applicatives. These morphemes allow a verb to take an additional bivalent voice marker or to
take a new participant as a core argument. The most straightforward morphemes of this type
are the causative suffix -poj (cf. 9.3) and the benefactive and malefactive suffixes -kwa and
-bij (cf. 9.4). The suffix -kwi or -pi ‘LOC’, which only occurs on semantically bivalent bases,
is clearly an applicative morpheme since it introduces a location as an additional undergoer.
Other applicative suffixes are more difficult to describe, since their function can vary
according to the base they are attached to. Section 9.6 presents the not very productive
applicative suffix -pa. Sections 9.7 and 9.8 deal with the applicative suffixes - e ‘co-
participant’ and -e ‘applicative’, which seem to be very similar in form and function, but
have clearly distinct functional and distributional properties. In 9.8, the agentive voice marker
-e e (cf. 8.1.3), phonologically also very similar to these applicative markers, will be brought
up again. An overview of the main properties of these three phonologically similar
morphemes is provided in Section 9.9.
  Other verbal morphemes, which do not interact directly with the voice and valency
properties of the verb and which generally have an aspectual or a modal function, are
described in Ch. 10.","[387, 388, 389, 390]"
"As can be seen, Movima only deviates in minor points from the typical Amazonian patterns
observed by Dixon and Aikhenvald, while the similarities are striking. In the following
paragraphs, I will point out some other features of Movima, not mentioned in connection with
the list above.
  Lexical tone, a feature found in a number of Amazonian languages, is not present in
Movima. Instead, there is contrastive vowel length. A consonant which deserves special
mention, since it does not seem to be common in the area, is the voiceless lateral fricative / /.
The syllable structure is simple: either CV or CVC.
  Morphological features which deserve special mention include the existence of an infix,
inserted according to metric criteria. Different types of reduplication are not only frequent, but
also serve a wide range of functions which are noteworthy from a cross-linguistic perspective.
These include, among other things, voice marking, the marking of inalienable possession, the
expression of predicative possession, and nominalization. Furthermore, Movima uses10
different cliticization processes to distinguish grammatical relations.
  The major parts of speech, distinguished by their morphological properties, are verbs,
nouns, and particles. Adjectives form a subclass of nouns. Referential elements (articles,
pronouns, demonstratives) constitute a category of their own, but display nounlike rather than
verblike properties. The class of particles is heterogeneous, the defining feature being that
particles are not productively combined with other morphemes. There are no ideophones.
  The fine-grained system of reference and deixis, expressed by referential elements (articles,
pronouns, demonstratives) is highly complicated, something which is not uncommon for
Amazonian languages. Gender, number, presence, absence, visibility, position, and motion
form the main parameters of deictic reference. The system also marks temporal categories on
nominal constituents, differentiating between actual or future existence and ceased existence
of the referent.
  Compounding and incorporation occur frequently. The different degrees of lexicalization of
words created by these processes make the morphological description of Movima difficult.
The morphological entities that can form part of a compound or can be incorporated into a
verb are nouns, noun roots, truncated nominal elements, and other bound elements with
lexical content. Many of these morphemes have a classificatory function, indicating shape and
consistency of an entity. All this is typical for Amazonian languages (cf. Payne 1990).
Demonstratives and other pronouns are not combined with nominal elements.
  Inalienable possession is an important criterion for the semantic classification of nouns.
Relational (inalienably possessed) nouns have to be overtly marked when denoting an
unpossessed or inalienably possessed entity; conversely, non-relational nouns are overtly
marked when denoting an inalienably possessed entity.
  A clause can have maximally two core arguments, depending on the valency of the verb.
The valency of a verb is generally overtly indicated by voice markers, which also specify the
semantic role(s) of the argument(s). The productivity and function of voice markers depend
on semantic properties of the base. Grammatical relations are distinguished by the way in
which the argument is cliticized to the base. It seems that Movima displays syntactic
ergativity, most clearly in relative clauses.
  As mentioned above, only the transitive argument higher on the animacy hierarchy is
obligatorily encoded. Strikingly, there is no obligatory marker for the first person singular, so
that this person is implicit on a bivalent predicate unmarked for person. This is untypical for
Amazonian languages (Dan Everett, p.c.). It has to do with the fact that, while all persons,
except the first, are encoded by enclitics, first and second person are (also) encoded by
optional bound pronouns preceding the predicate. The first person is not encoded by an
enclitic, but by the optional preverbal form only.
  There is no copula. Instead, in equational or possessive clauses, nouns function as
predicates. Morphological verbs can occur in NPs, their voice marker specifying the referent.
Serial verb constructions only exist to a very limited degree, and always involve verbs of
directed motion.","[33, 34]"
"                                                                                                             229
In all these examples, the version with the relative clause is preferred over the version with
the oblique pronoun only. Compare the following three examples with (3), (5), and (6),
respectively, above:(8)     as        roya=n di’ n-ulkwan

with the oblique-marked pronoun, which is used, but not preferred in elicitation, may,
therefore, be an elliptic version of the relative clause. In order to find out whether this is the
case, more nouns have to be tested for their relational status (cf. 6.2). Subsequently, the
different constructions in which possessed nouns can occur have to be systematized and tested
with all these nouns.","[252, 253]"

While all predicate nominals can be reduplicated in order to function as the predicate of a
negative or subordinate clause, the suffix - e has a more limited distribution. First of all, the
form with - e occurs more often in negative than in subordinate clauses. The following
example illustrates this. In (16)a, the adjective tochi’ ‘small’ occurs in a negative clause with
the suffix - e. In (16)b, it is shown that in a subordinate clause, this suffix cannot be used.
Rather, the reduplicated form has to be used, as shown by (16)c (cf. also (8) above).(16)    a. kas     tochi'- e
           NEG small-NMZ.N
           ‘I am not small.’                                                        {JM 16, 253a}        b. * n-os         tochi’- e,          asko       bijaw-ni:-na

prototypical nouns are only rarely found with this suffix (cf. 3.10.4.3). The only text example
of a noun with the suffix - e in a negative clause is given in (17):(17)    jayna kas        don-’i- e=os       chi:~chi

reduplication, may be that when reduplicated, the word would be homophonous with the
inalienably possessed form. Recall from 3.7.5 and 6.4.1 that like action nominalization,
inalienable possession is marked by infixing reduplication. This is illustrated in (18) for the
same word as in (17) above. The sentence in (18) is the one which follows (17) in the
narration.(18)    ba:-ra          jayna     os         don-<‘i:~>‘i        jayna

        ‘I had lost all my blood.’ [lit: “My blood was finished.”] {EA, Cbba 160}In this particular context, it is possible that the suffix - e is used in (17) in order to distinguish
the negated predicate nominal from the inalienably possessed noun in (18). However, it can
still be concluded that adjectives are more often combined with the suffix - e than nouns,
especially in negative clauses, so that the tendency to use - e on adjectives can be seen as a
distinction between the two word classes.
   Before concluding the present section, I will briefly discuss verbs that contain the ending
-wa, but where this element does not have a nominalizing function. Examples include                                                                                                 471

        {EA, Tolkosya I 028}When these verbs are nominalized, the nominalizing suffix -wa is attached. This shows that
-wa in (19) and (20) above is not the nominalizing suffix, but part of the verbal base.(21)    n-as       tivijniwa-wa=i

        ‘I am not ashamed of myself, of how I am.’         {HR, TX 088}While the verb chajaniwa ‘be ashamed’ (cf. (20)) always occurs with the ending -wa, there is
also a verb tivijni ‘hurt’, derived from the noun ti:vij ‘pain’, which does not contain the
ending -wa. Here, a difference in meaning can be observed: the argument of the verb tivijni
‘hurt’ expresses the body part which hurts, whereas the argument of the verb tivijni:wa ‘feel
pain’ expresses the person or animal that feels pain. Compare (24) below, which contains the
nominalized form of the verb tivijni ‘hurt’, with (19) above, which contains the verb tivijni:wa
‘feel pain’. Apart from the difference in meaning, ‘hurt’ versus ‘feel pain’, the form in (24) is
a relational noun, while the one in (19) above is a monovalent verb.(23)    tivij-ni    as    bari=‘ne

        ‘That was when her toe hurt.’                          {EA, Lagartija 021}  Thus, there is a suffix -wa, homophonous with the nominalizer, which has an applicative
function, raising a new participant to argument function. However, this suffix does not seem
to be productive, since only these two examples were found.","[493, 494, 495]"

2.9.2.   Morphologically conditioned long vowels
In 2.8.2, the basic rule for prosodic vowel lengthening was presented: in prinicple, the
penultimate open syllable of a word is lengthened, unless the word ends in a simple glottal
stop, while all other syllables of the word are short. There are, however, deviations from this
rule, in part predictable. They occur in the following order:     1. When an internal clitic is attached, the penultimate syllable is short.
     2. The penultimate syllable is long when it belongs to a loan or when it is a
        monosyllabic root.",[79]

"9.2.5. Incorporated elements denoting an instrument
Occasionally, incorporated modifiers are found denoting an entity which is involved in the
event, but which is neither a part of the undergoer nor the Ground with respect to which the
event takes place. Since it denotes an entity that is involved, but not affected by the event, it
can be labelled “instrument”. As is the case with incorporated elements denoting the Ground
(cf. 9.2.4), the verb receives the applicative marker -e . The following examples illustrate this:

Often, modifying incorporation involves the incorporation of a classificatory bound nominal
element (cf. 5.3.2, 5.3.4) that indicates a physical shape in which an action is carried out or
the shape of the product in which the action results. This process can have a similar function
as depictive predicates in languages like English. The incorporated bound root ew ‘BR.tail’
in the verb damoy ewna ‘braid’ in (70), for example, indicates that hair is twisted in a such a
way that it resembles a tail. And the incorporated bound root ba ‘BR.round’ in (71) indicates
that the action of chewing results in a round object.(70)    damoy- ew-na--as            kabo di’ sum-na is                risa-<kwa~>kwa=i       ney

        ‘It [the cow] chewed my dress into a ball.’                           {EA, Cbba 089}This type of modifying incorporation resembles argument incorporation. The incorporated
elements are usually the same as those that can be incorporated as arguments, and in argument
incorporation, the type of undergoer is characterized inside the verb. However, like the other
types of modifying incorporation, the process discussed here creates verbs that are subject to
voice alternations.
  Moreover, in difference to argument incorporation, the clause can usually not contain a
coreferential noun phrase, since the meaning of the incorporated element is often                                                                                               385
metaphorically extended. For example, it would not be possible to replace the incorporated
element - ew in (70) by the noun e~ ew-kwa ‘tail’ (RED~BR.tail-ABS), since the undergoer
of the event is not a tail, but hair. Likewise, the verb danaba ‘chew into a ball’ in (71) does
not refer to an action affecting a round object, but to an action that results in a round object.
  Argument incorporation is different in this respect, even though it can also have
classificatory features. In (72), the incorporated element classifies the patient as a round-
shaped object, whose identity is specified by an external NP.(72)    jiram-poj-kay-a=‘ne         toje os        ek-a-ba-wa=‘ne

incorporated element -ba. Here, it also seems to be the case that the result of the action is a
round-shaped object, similar to (71) above.(73)    che jay e jayna it-a-ba=n                          kos     ve’e

        ‘They put the thread in the middle, they rolled it.’ [when making candles]
        {GB, Ganado 009}Example (75) is interesting in that it oscillates between classificatory incorporation and the
incorporation of a Ground-denoting element (cf. 9.2.4). On the one hand, the incorporated
element denotes the Ground with respect to which the action is carried out (‘to sit on an
animal’). This is also signalled by the applicative suffix -e (cf. 9.8.3). On the other hand, the
incorporated element does not denote the undergoer, but rather specifies the way in which the
action is carried out (‘as if sitting down on an animal’). Therefore, this is also a case of
classificatory incorporation.(75)    as-poy-e: -e                   n-is         kori:di

        ‘We sat on the sticks [i.e., our hobbyhorses].’             {EA, Dichiyeye 013}As this example shows, the different types of modifying incorporation are not always easy to
keep apart. Furthermore, not only between the types of modifying incorporation, but also
between argument incorporation and classificatory incorporation, there seem to be quite a few
borderline cases. The fact that classificatory bound elements can not only represent386
incorporated arguments, but are also productively used as modifiers, may be responsible for
the apparent lability or irregular valency properties of some incorporating verbs described in
9.1.3 above (in particular, (34)–(36)). It is possible that these cases represent a transition from
valency-reducing argument incorporation towards valency-retaining classificatory
incorporation, of the kind described by Mithun (1984).","[407, 408, 409, 410]"

6.5.3. Retention and reduplication of -kwa
Instead of dropping the suffix -kwa, as described in the previous section, the nouns ending in
-kwa (cf. (59)) can undergo infixing reduplication when denoting an inalienably possessed
entity. This is the same process as with any other non-relational noun (cf. 6.4.1). As will be
shown in 6.6.3, for body-part terms ending in -kwa, this is the only option for possessive
marking. Since the suffix -kwa is the final element of these nouns, this is the syllable that is
reduplicated:(74)    as      lora-n-<kwa~>kwa=as                      manka
        ART.n BR.leaf-LN-<INAL~>ABS=ART.n                mango
        ‘the mango leaf’(75)    as     mosi-<kwa:~>kwa
        ART.n BR.lower_back-<INAL~>ABS
        ‘my lower back’At least synchronically, there does not seem to be a semantic difference between this
mechanism and the one described above, which involves the omission of -kwa. Both can be
used when the referent is physically attached to its possessor as well as when it is detached
from it. This is shown by (76)a and b which both equally express inalienable possession:(76)    a. i’ko          lora-n-a=as         manka
           PRO.pl        BR.leaf-LN-LV-ART.n mango        ~b. i’ko       lora-n<kwa~>-kwa=as                        manka

            ‘They are mango leaves.’                                 {EA 13, 135c}However, in elicitation, speakers do employ the different constructions in order to
differentiate between the two types of inalienable possession (attachment and detachment).
This can be seen in the following examples. In both, variant a. is used to refer to an entity that
is still part of a whole, and b. is used for a detached entity:(77)    a. is           di~di-n-a=as                   ko’

nouns ending in -kwa had the function of differentiating between attached vs. detached
inalienable possession. This is because speakers still use this resource, although
inconsistently. However, at the present stage of the language, a specific inalienable relation is
not connected to a specific possessive form: both are used interchangeably, as was shown in
(76). Finally, note that on body-part terms with the ending -kwa, this ending is always
reduplicated and not dropped. This will be described in the following section.","[270, 271, 272]"

either omitted or retained. This depends on the possessive relationship between the actor and                                                                                              487
the entity denoted by that noun. When the relation is that of inalienable possession, the suffix
is replaced by the verbalizer, as in (97):(97)      mori-n-ti’          ‘to blossom [a plant]’       (BR.blossom-LV-VBZ)
          jo -ti’             ‘to lay eggs [a hen]’        (BR.egg-VBZ)
          ba~ba -ti’          ‘to build the nest [a bird]’ (RED~BR.cover-VBZ)Note here that the verbalizing suffix is not attached to the noun root, but to the base from
which the suffix -kwa is omitted. Otherwise, the last word in this list would have the form
ba -ti’ instead of ba~ba -ti’.262
  When there is no relationship of inalienable possession, the absolute-state suffix -kwa is
retained on these bases:(98)      mo~mo -kwa:-ti’
          RED~BR.shell-ABS-VBZ
          ‘to make shells (i.e., to peel eggs or something similar in order to obtain shells)’(99)      jo -kwa-n-ti’
          BR.egg-ABS-LN-VBZ
          ‘to make an egg’The denominal verb formed by the attachment of -ti’ behaves like a monovalent verb. This
means that before further suffixes, the ending -ti’ is dropped (cf. 8.7). The meaning of the
base is that of the denominal verb, not that of the noun alone (cf. also 3.10.2).263 In (100)–
(102), this is shown for nominalized forms (cf. also (39) above):

   This is the same process as that found in possessor encoding on these bases (cf. 6.4.2).
263
   Since the meaning of the verbalizing suffix -ti’ is retained in these words, while the suffix itself is not overtly
present, these cases may be analysed as containing a zero allomorph -ti’. Before postulating a zero allomorph
here, however, it needs to be investigated whether this is also possible for the other monovalent verbal
morphemes that are dropped before further suffixation (cf. 8.7.1).","[509, 510, 511]"

in determiner function, i.e. with the cliticized determining element (cf. 4.4), usually the long
form is used:(158)       i:ri=s                kwe ris
            DM.spk.pl=DET sujo
            ‘This sujo [type of reed].’                                                             {EA 6, 119}The long form is probably used here because the short form together with the determining
element (here, i:=s) would in some cases be phonologically similar to the presential article (is
‘ART.pl’). The short form of the speaker-oriented neuter demonstrative, in contrast, is often
found in article position, since it is sufficiently distinct from it. Here, it is interchangeable
with the long form:(159)       a. ay=s               do’we      ~               b. ayru=s       do’we

does not occur with any of the other referential elements, and further research is needed to
explain it.86 The following example illustrates it:(160)       jayna     ayru        ay    loy-’i
            DSC       DM.spk.n DM.spk.n make_ready-D

simply repeated:(161)       kilni        kilni       da’       de:-che n-as    mo<si~>si=n,

of either the speaker or the addressee. This includes the body parts of the respective person
(cf. (162)), entities in direct contact with the body (in (163), the speaker is holding the object),
and entities that are within reach of either speaker or adressee (cf. (161) above and (164)
below). In contrast to the other presential demonstratives (cf. 4.9.2 below), the proximate
demonstratives do not require that the speaker actually looks at the referent (as shown by
(164)).","[197, 198]"

1.7. History of linguistic description
The first materials of the Movima language are lists of words and phrases (Hervás y Panduro
1787, D’Orbigny 1838, Heath 1883, Cardús 1886, Chamberlain 1910, Créqui-Montfort &
Rivet 1914, del Castillo 1929). Of these older lists, the one produced by the missionary
Cardús (1886) is most reproduced in the literature. In the 1960s, Movima was studied
extensively by Robert and Judith Judy of the Summer Institute of Linguistics. The results
include a word list with a grammatical sketch (1962a), an outline of the phoneme inventory
(1962b), two articles on specific topics (J. Judy 1965 and R. Judy 1965), and a tagmemic
grammar (1965 and 1967).
  A government-financed alphabetization campaign led by Colette Grinevald in 1995 raised
new interest in the language. An alphabet was created by the speakers, mainly based on the
orthography used by Judy and Judy, but with some changes (most importantly, c and qu were
replaced by k). The workshops, furthermore, resulted in the publication of a collection of
stories in Movima (Ministerio de Desarrollo Sostenible y Planificación 1998) and in a course
book introducing the alphabet (Ministerio de Educación et al. 2003). Also, Colette Grinevald
published an article on Movima noun classifiers (Grinevald 2002). Of the several unpublished
materials inspired by the workshops, an extensive word list by Eligardo Chirimani (1998)
deserves special mention. It needs to be said that without those workshops, the present
grammar may not have been written: it is because of the interest expressed by the Movima
participants that Movima was proposed to me as a language of research.
  The present research project is part of the Spinoza project “Lexicon and Syntax” directed by
Pieter Muysken, which aims at describing as many of the language isolates in Amazonian
Bolivia and Brazil as possible. It is hoped that it will serve as a basis for the production of
materials that will help the Movimas to teach and learn their ancestral language.",[29]

In yet another example, future tense is indicated by the adverbial clause nas tawa’ni
‘tomorrow’:(213)   n-as       tawa’-ni         joy-che kos           aviyon [...]
        obl-ART.n next_day-PRC go-R/R ART.n.a plane
        di’ kwey way-na no-kos               wa:ka nakal           n-as        Peru
        REL FOC take-DR obl-ART.n.a cow              over_there obl-ART.n Peru
        ‘Tomorrow the plane will leave [...] which (will) take the beef over there to El Perú.’
        {EA, Cbba 213}In all these cases, the form kwey clearly represents the focus marker (kaw), since its use as a
past-tense marker is ruled out by the context.
  In order to focus on an argument and to indicate immediate past tense in the same clause,
kaw and kwey can cooccur. This is shown in (214) and (215) below. In (214), the particles can
be distinguished by their position. The clause-initial particle is the one that indicates past
tense, while the particle following the free pronoun is the focus marker kaw, in accordance
with the analysis of (206) and (207) above:(214)   kwey u’ko        kwey puru’-na        n-i’ne
        IMM PRO.m FOC kiss-DR                 obl-PRO.f
        ‘He has just kissed her.’                                            {EA 10, 037d}In (215), the tense particle is clearly identifiable because it occurs in the long form, kweyka.
The focus particle is in place after the free pronoun.(215)   in a       kwey sal-na  kweyka
        PRO.1sg FOC search-DR IMM
        ‘I just looked for it.’                                              {ER 11, 015b}Example (216) even shows adjacent cooccurrence of the focus marker kaw, realized as [kaw],
and the tense particle kwey:(216)   i’ne    kwey kaw        dewaj-na      nu-kus      itila:kwa
        PRO.f IMM FOC see-DR                  obl-ART.m.a man
        ‘She has seen the man right now.’                                     {EA 7, 057k}Thus, the particles kaw can usually be clearly distinguished from kwey, even though the two
are often homophonous.
  However, there are also cases in which the distinction between the two particles is difficult
to draw, and where a more detailed analysis is needed. This is especially the case when kwey
occurs inside a noun phrase that contains a verb, as in (217):(217)   jayna    kas oso’-ni-wa            os          kwey      sal-na
        DSC      NEG DM.n.p-PRC-NMZ ART.n.p FOC                  search-DR
        ‘There was no one left who would look for (it).’                        {GC 18, 396}                                                                                             541
In this example, the particle inside the NP can be identified as the focus particle kaw. This is
because the referent of the NP that contains a direct transitive verb, salna ‘search’, is not the
undergoer, as would be predicted from the voice marker -na (cf. 8.1.1, 8.2), but the actor. This
is the typical effect of the focus particle kaw, which demotes the former ARG2 from the
clausal core (cf. 7.8). If the focus particle were absent, or if the form kwey were the tense
marker, then the NP in (217) would denote the undergoer of the event, and the translation of
the clause would be ‘the (thing) I looked for was not there anymore’.
  Example (218) is similar to (217) above. Here, the fact that the particle inside the NP is
realized as kaw serves as evidence that it is the focus marker and not the tense particle:(218)   ka:w-e            is             kaw     ji:-ba:-na
        much-BE.person ART.pl            FOC     cry-BR.round-DR
        ‘Many cried for (him).’                                                   {GC 18, 394a}In other cases, where the exchangeability with /kaw/ was not tested, the element kwey within
an NP rather seems to be the tense particle. For example, in (219) below, the referent of the
NP containing a direct bivalent verb is the undergoer. The presence of the element kwey does
not have the effect of demoting the argument denoting the undergoer, as it does in (217) and
(218) above. Therefore, it probably represents the past-tense particle kwey.(219)   i:ri        i:          ney is        kwey dej-na di’ n-i’ne
        DM.spk.pl DM.spk.pl here ART.pl IMM? cook-DR REL obl-PRO.f
        ‘Here is what I have cooked for her.’                        {EA 19, 315d}
12.5.      Negative particles
Negation in Movima is expressed by particles, usually in combination with a morphological
modification of the predicate. In most cases, the predicate either contains a negative marker
(e.g. the irrealis infix <a’>), or it is nominalized. The negative particles, and the types of
predicates or clauses they occur with, are listed in (220):(220)   kas      ‘not’               +    nominalized or negative predicate
        loy      ‘not’                    (in subordinate and relative clauses)
                                     +    (partial) nominalization
        mo:      ‘not yet’           +    partial nominalization
        ka’      ‘don’t’             +    partial nominalization
        ka:      ‘in order not to’   +    adverbial clauseI will illustrate these particles in the following sections.","[563, 564, 565]"
"
10.6.      The intensifier -u’/-ay’
The suffix -u’/-ay’ (-ku’/-kay’ after a vowel) has an intensifying function. It indicates that the
action denoted by the verb root is carried out carefully, completely, with more energy, etc.
The suffix is very rare in the text data. The following examples are from elicitation, and the
consultant provided an adequate context:(115)    loy i tan-u’-na             bo       ka:      n-as          ru -a-ra:-wa

         ITN 1 adorn-INT REAS ART.n pretty<NMZ.N~>=n
         ‘I’ll adorn it carefully so that it will be pretty.’                       {EA 12, 148}(117)    tam-vo:s-e                    bo       ka      rey           bat-u’-na:-wa=a
         get_down-BE.wood-APPL REAS NEG.1 again                       put-INT-DR-NMZ=n
         ‘It fell down because I didn’t hang it up well.’                        {EA 12, 153a}The intensifying suffix has two allomorphs: -u’ and -ay’. They are illustrated in (118) and
(119), respectively.(118)    jat-u’-na
         hit-INT-DR
         ‘I hit X strongly.’(119)    suy-ay’-na
         deprive-INT-DR
         ‘I take (it) away completely from X.’247
   The word al-baycho in (109), to which a referential element is internally cliticized, may seem to be a
contradictory example. However, this word occurs in an NP denoting a possessed entity, and the possessor is
always internally cliticized.",[472]
"412
cases, the possessor of the affected entity is encoded as ARG2. The example contains a
sequence of five transitive clauses. The predicate of the first clause is a simple bivalent verb
( ap-u’-na ‘I wash X well’), followed by three bivalent verbs with an incorporated modifier.
The predicate of the last clause is a verb with an incorporated argument and the applicative
suffix -e .(198)   ba:-ra           ap-u’-na,       wichi’-ka-ben-na,                 jawo-bakwa:-na,

        ‘I bathe them all well, I rub them (their skin), I soap them (their heads), then I wash
        them (their heads), I change them (their clothes).’            {EA, Nietos 002}I will now turn to the comparison between the suffixes -e ‘APPL’ described here and - e
‘CO’ described in 9.7 above. These suffixes are similar in that they both have and applicative
function and can be attached to verbs containing an incorporated argument. However, there is
a crucial difference. First of all, observe the different structures of bases containing these
suffixes, represented in (199):(199)   a. VR + -a + incorporated argument + -e        (described here)
        b. VR + -a + incorporated argument + - e + -na (cf. 9.7.1 above, (164)–(166))The two structures are illustrated in (200) and (201). In (200), which corresponds to the
pattern in (199)a, the verbal base is put in square brackets in order to illustrate the point that
will be discussed below.(200)   [loj-a-’oj]- e:-na              kino alra
        wash-DR-BE.clothes-CO-DR ART.f.a.1 friend
        ‘I help my friend do the washing.’                                 {EA, 14, 216}(201)   loy i       loj-a-’o:j-e                     us    alwaj
        ITN 1       wash-DR-BE.clothes-APPL          ART.m spouse
        ‘I’ll wash my husband’s clothes.’                                    {EA 14, 132}In both constructions, a monovalent base that contain an incorporated argument undergoes a
valency increase. However, the suffix - e ‘CO’ is attached to a complex verb with an
incorporated argument in the same way as to any other monovalent base, as indicated by the
square brackets in (200). The direct marker -na is then added to create a semantically bivalent
verb, so that the newly introduced co-participant can be encoded as ARG2. The suffix -e
‘APPL’, in contrast, does not take an additional bivalent voice marker. Rather, it demotes the
grammatical function of the incorporated element from that of an argument to that of a
modifier (cf. 9.2 above). Therefore, on the resulting verb, it is the original bivalent voice
marker, obligatory for argument incorporation, that marks the verb as semantically bivalent.
However, note that here, this marker cannot be dropped to create a monovalent verb,
something which is possible with modifier incorporation.","[435, 436]"

1.11. Presentation of the data
The presentation of the Movima data as well as the English translation given deserve some
explanation.
  When a bivalent predicate in Movima is not combined with a cliticized referential element,
this automatically implies that the first argument is the first person singular. All bivalent
verbs, furthermore, have an implicit second argument, even though it is not obligatorily
overtly realized. Therefore, a simple bivalent verb without person marking is translated into
English as a full clause with a first person singular subject; the implied second argument is
always represented as “X”:(1)     sal-na    ‘I look for X.’Temporal categories are often not overtly indicated in Movima, but inferred from the context.
Hence, a clause unmarked for tense can imply any temporal category (past, present, future),
and example (1) can mean ‘I (have) looked for X,’ ‘I will look for X,’ etc. This is a problem
for the English translation, which I have solved as follows: examples where no context exists
(in particular, elicitation examples) are translated into the English simple present, even when
this does not sound like good English. Examples where a temporal context exists, even when
this cannot be seen in the example itself, are translated in a way which fits into this context
(e.g., ‘I looked for X’ in (1)). In many examples, the translation fits with the Movima data,
since tense is often reflected in the article.
  An area where Movima displays finer differentiations than English is spatial deixis: articles,
pronouns and demonstratives always indicate whether a referent is present, absent, in
existence or out of existence. Unless relevant for the discussion, I do not reflect these
categories in the English translation:(2)     a. i’nes kwe:ya            b. kinos     kwe:ya     c.        isnos     kwe:ya
           ART.f woman                ART.f.a woman                  ART.f.p woman
           ‘the/a woman (present)’    ‘the/a woman (absent)’         ‘the/a woman (deceased)’
           ‘the/a woman’               ‘the/a woman’                 ‘the/a woman’Occasionally, I use the indices i and j when it is necessary to indicate whether two are
coreferential or not:(3)     di’ joy-sicha’kwa=‘ne joy-che --i’ne, jankwa=sne
        HYP go-DES=f                  go-R/R--f        say=f.a
        ‘If she i wants to go, she i goes, shej said.’In the English translations, I use round brackets (as in (2)a and b) for relevant information
implicit in the Movima example. Contextual information, which cannot be inferred from the
example, is given in square brackets:(4)     sal-na      ‘I look for [her].’Many particles indicating tense, aspect, and mood (henceforth TAM) and discourse particles                                                                                             13
are hard to translate. For example, it is not clear how the particle rey in (5), which occurs in
almost every sentence, should be translated:(5)      bo        rey     ban-cho           os       ben‘i
         REAS      again bare-BR.inside ART.n.p grassland
         ‘Because the savannah was flat (you know/of course?).’             {EA, Cbba 164}Therefore, I often do not translate these particles.
  Square brackets with dots […] in the Movima example mean that a part of the text has been
omitted.
  It was necessary to employ special symbols representing different morphological processes.
Most are taken from the Leipzig Glossing Rules of 2003, like those given in (6).13 Others,
shown in (7), are specifically introduced for the purpose of the present description.(6)      ~       reduplication
         <>      infixation(7)      =       (internal) cliticization
         --      external cliticizationAs suggested by the Leipzig Glossing Rules, I sometimes use a colon ( : ) in the glosses when
it is not practical to segment the Movima word. For example, when a morphologically
complex noun is incorporated into a verb, this process can be represented more adequately
when the different morphemes of the noun are not set apart. In (8), an example is given of a
complex noun (cf. (8)a) that is incorporated into a verb (cf. (8)b). From the glosses in (8)b, it
can be seen that the noun consists of several morphemes. In (8)c, the morphemes are
separated; here, it is not directly clear from the representation whether the suffix - e modifies
the verb or, as is actually the case, belongs to the noun.(8)      a. kwa-n- e                          b. ban-kwan e         c. ban-kwa-n- e
            BR.mouth-LN-CO                       put-BR.mouth:LN:CO    put-BR.mouth-LN-CO
            ‘upper side, opening’                ‘to be put on top’    ‘to be put on top’The source of the examples is usually indicated. Between braces, the speaker code is given
(cf. Table 1), followed by either a word, an abbreviation, or a number. In text examples, the
speaker code is followed by words or by an abbreviation indicating the text, as shown (9)a.
Elicitation examples are marked by a number following the speaker code, as in (9)b.14
Examples from elicitation on demonstratives are marked by “DEM”, as in (9)c.","[35, 36, 37]"

monosyllabic noun roots fall in this group, as do some disyllabic roots that denote inalienably
possessed entities. Like verb roots, many monosyllabic noun roots are combined with the
dummy element -‘i in order to form an independent word, as in (5). Others undergo
reduplication, as will be shown in 5.3.2.1. Still others can occur as the root of an independent
noun when combined with the suffix -kwa (cf. 5.3.2.3, 6.5). Some of these are additionally
reduplicated. Examples of bound roots in combination with the suffix -kwa are shown in (6).(5)       nun-’i                ‘bone’            (BR.bone-D)

themselves. They all denote inalienably possessed entities: they can form the root of an
independent noun only when the noun is marked as possessed (cf. 6.1) or when combined
with the absolute-state suffix -kwa. In (7) and (8), examples of bound disyllabic roots are
given that are combined with the suffix -kwa.(7)       *to:da                toda-n-kwa

Several phenomena can be observed here: most SAPs are encoded not only by enclitics, but
also by proclitics;147 only the internal clitics (representing ARG1) are obligatory; there is no
enclitic encoding the first person singular ARG1. I will discuss all these points here, first with
respect to the encoding of ARG1, then with respect to ARGintr. Finally, I will describe the
encoding of SAPs by free pronouns.
  The structure of clauses with an SAP argument is schematized in (47).(47)       a. intransitive: (TOP)         (ARGintr [SAP])     PRED                       (ARGintr [pl])           b. transitive: (TOP)           (ARG1[+1st])        PRED=ARG1[+2nd, pl] (ARG2 [3rd])The schematization in (47) shows that, as with third-person arguments, only the internal clitic
of ARG1 in the transitive construction (cf. (47)b) is grammatically obligatory. In (47)a, it can
be seen that in intransitive clauses, the argument is represented by a bound pronoun before the
predicate, and only plurality is encoded after the predicate (cf. also 4.1). This is illustrated in
(48)a and b for the first person singular and plural, respectively:(48)       a. in        jo’yaj            ‘I arrived.’
           b. in        jo’yaj--iy’ i     ‘We (excl.) arrived.’When ARG1 of a transitive clause (cf. (47)b) is or includes the first person, i.e., when it is first
person singular, first person inclusive, or first plural, it is represented by a bound pronoun
before the predicate. In contrast, an ARG1 including the second person or plural is
(additionally) represented by a bound pronoun encliticized to the predicate. This is seen most
clearly in the case of the first person plural inclusive, illustrated in (49).148
146
    Note that the proclitics are not phonologically connected to their syntactic host (cf. 4.1).
147
    However, the second person can only be encoded by an enclitic.
148
    As was pointed out by Rik van Gijn (p.c.), the fact that unlike non-SAPs, certain SAPs (except a second-
person ARG1) can be encoded by a proclitic leads to a split in constituent order: while the latter construction is
predicate-initial (not counting the topic position), the construction with an SAP argument can be argument-
initial.","[291, 292]"

Acknowledgements
Many people have helped me get this work done. First and foremost, my gratitude goes to
Pieter Muysken, who has made this project possible by hosting it within his Spinoza
programme “Lexicon and Syntax” at the Radboud University Nijmegen. Not only did I
benefit from his insightful comments on earlier drafts of the manuscript, which were always
to the point and opened new lines of thought for me. He also gave me the feeling that
whatever problem there would be on the way, he would try to help out. Whenever I
approached him for linguistic or non-linguistic advice, I got an open ear, no matter whether it
was the right moment or not. His confidence in this project and his constant encouragement
were an enormous support.
   I was also very lucky in that during the entire project, I had Rik van Gijn as my office mate.
This meant lots of fun, discussions, and the possibility to exchange experiences on life in the
linguistic world. My work has benefited greatly from Rik’s insights and from his talent to
present things systematically.
   Hein van der Voort, occasional office mate, advised me in many ways. In particular, I am
very grateful for his extremely detailed, critical and helpful comments on the entire
manuscript.
   I owe many thanks to Mily Crevels, who has helped me a lot especially at the beginning of
this project. In particular, Mily accompanied me to Santa Ana in 2001, and through her I got
acquainted with the people who became my closest friends there. With respect to field work
and dealing with practical matters in the Beni, Mily gave me the most valuable advice.
   Outside the Spinoza group, I want to thank the following linguists for commenting on
earlier drafts of specific chapters of this book, for discussing the data with me, and/or for
advising me on particular topics: Willem Adelaar, Martin Böhler, Werner Drossard, Dan
Everett, Mats Exter, Ad Foolen, Colette Grinevald, Carlos Gussenhoven, Birgit Hellwig,
Nikolaus Himmelmann, Helen de Hoop, Haike Jacobs, Leonid Kulikov, Geraldine Legendre,
Andrej Malchukov, Maarten Mous, Doris Payne, Hans-Jürgen Sasse, René Schiering, Anna
Siewierska, Leon Stassen, and Fernando Zúñiga. I am especially grateful to Werner Drossard,
Nikolaus Himmelmann, and Hans-Jürgen Sasse for the long and inspiring discussions on the
Movima voice and valency system, whose essence I would probably never have understood
otherwise. My particular gratitude also goes to Willem Adelaar and Carlos Gussenhoven for
discussing earlier versions of the phonology chapter with me, and for their patience in
answering my numerous questions on the topic. In addition, I am deeply indebted to Willem
Adelaar for his valuable comments on the entire manuscript. And Maarten Mous is especially
thanked for sitting with me for hours when I was desperate and did not know how this work
could ever come to an end.
   Pilar Valenzuela is acknowledged for pointing out Movima to me as a possible language of
research.
   I furthermore want to thank the participants of the Americanist Colloquium in Nijmegen for
their comments on my talks, in particular Jürgen Bohnemeyer, Swintha Danielsen, Martina
Faller, Rafael Fischer, Jesus Mario Girón, Katja Hanss, Roland Hemmauer, Sergio Meira,
Loretta O’Connor, and Frank Seifart. And without the critical questions from the participants
of my “Strukturkurs Movima” at the Linguistics Department in Cologne, some problems and
contradictions in my analyses would hardly ever have become apparent to me.                                                                                                i
   While it was not possible to integrate into the present work all the comments I got, they
highly increased my insight into the Movima grammar.
   My research has also benefited greatly from the open and friendly atmosphere at the
Linguistics Department of the Radboud University in Nijmegen. My thanks go particularly to
Helen de Hoop, Monique Lamers, Peter de Swart, Andrej Malchukov, Joost Zwarts, Wilske
Driessen, Janine van der Zijl, Else Havik, Margot van den Berg, and Marleen van de Vate.
   It is hard to express my gratitude adequately to the Movima speakers who contributed the
data on which this grammar is based. Their hospitality and their willingness to teach me their
language were overwhelming.
   First of all, I want to thank Esaltación Amblo Ovales, who took upon herself the task of
teaching me Movima. She is the best teacher I could have imagined, with her clarity of
pronunciation, her great memory, and her readiness to talk to me in Movima about all kinds of
topics. I am also grateful to her sister Etelvina and her cousin Modesta for receiving me in
their house with so much friendliness.
   My thanks go furthermore to Julia Malale Humasa, my principal teacher during my first and
my last stay. Good-humoured and funny, yet serious when it came to analysing her language,
she is a delightful instructor.
   I owe many thanks to Eligardo Chirimani Malue for working with me every day right from
the beginning. Without his linguistic insight and his careful judgment, it would never have
been possible to create such a large and useful text database. Apart from that, it is mainly due
to the fact that he and Melvin Rossel Yoqui took so much interest in maintaining their native
language that this research was carried out at all. The other members of the Subcentral
Indígena Movima are also acknowledged for supporting this project throughout.
   I am furthermore grateful to Griselda Cáumol, Balvina Almaquio, Herlan Rojas, Ela Rossel,
Nelly Gualusna, Peregrina Cayú, Dora Vargas, Delmira Masaro, Nataniel Cáumol, Eleuterio
Mole, Alejandro Yónima, Juan Hualima, Bernarda Gualusna, María Esaltación Sepi, and Luis
Yalauma for teaching me their language.
   Most of my teachers I would never have met without the help of Janeth Cayalo. She took
me with her on her motorbike every day during the beginning of my field work to find
consultants. I am deeply grateful to her.
   This leads me to other friends in Santa Ana without whom my stays there would have been
much less effective and pleasant. Elsita Asbún, Esperanza Cayalo, Sonia Rivero, and Graciela
Rodríguez helped me in all aspects of daily life and became dear friends. Olga Arteaga and
her family provided a home for me for most the time, and their parrot was my most faithful
companion and probably the only one who learned words from me. I am also indebted to
Milton Villavicencio and his wife Loida for their great hospitality.
   Outside Santa Ana, I especially want to thank Dr. Carlos Patiño Kühn in Santa Cruz for
taking my health worries off my back. Gudrun Birk is thanked for digging with me in the
APCOB library.
   Last but not least, I want to thank my parents for their strong support at all times. My
friends in Cologne took up with my unusual lifestyle with much understanding. And my
deepest gratitude is with Harald Stoffels, who accompanied me towards and throughout this
entire project, and who is the main responsible for the fact that the years of thesis writing
were very happy years.

examples.chicha

7.6. Oblique arguments
The only case distinction in Movima is made between structural and oblique case. Structural
case is unmarked and identifies core arguments. Oblique case is indicated by the prefix n- on
the referential element (cf. 4.6). Consider the pair of examples in (98), which illustrates the
difference between an unmarked (a.) and an oblique-marked (b.) NP:(98)    a. usko     bay-a-cho=us                   as    wa:so
           PRO.m.a knock-DR-BR.inside=m.a          ART.n glass
           ‘He broke the glass.’                                               {EA 6, 162b}        b. usko     bay-a-cho=us                   n-as      wa:so

           ‘He broke X inside the glass.’                                    {EA 6, 162b}The interpretation of the oblique argument depends on the construction, on the semantic
properties of the predicate and the argument, and on the context. To illustrate the variable
interpretation of the oblique argument, four clauses are presented in (99) which each contain
the same verb, chi:chi ‘go out’, and an oblique argument. The oblique argument encodes a
goal in (99)a, a source in b, a temporal adjunct in c, and a purpose in d:(99)    a. che isne       chi:~chi        n-os chora:da

The examples in (100) show the same phenomenon with the oblique argument of the
monovalent verb kaykay ‘eat’. In (100)a, the oblique argument is the patient, in b, it is an
accompanier, in c., it is a source, and in d., it is a temporal adjunct.(100)   a. jayna kay~kay ni-kis               cho~cho -a=kis             ney o’im

clauses with an oblique argument. In (101), the oblique NP refers to a location and in (102), to
an instrument.(101)   jayna     isko     ye -na=us                     ni-kis       to:mi ja’a

        ‘They wiped (them) clean with a cloth.’                          {EA, Parabas 036}Since a clause in Movima can maximally have two core arguments, as was shown in (1)
above, one of the arguments of a verb denoting an event with three participants has to be
oblique. Here, it becomes apparent that Movima is a primary-object language (cf. Dryer
1986), since the agent and the recipient are core arguments, while the theme is marked as
oblique. This can be seen in (103) and (104):(103)   kay<a> e=us       os         pa:ko n-os          charke
        give<DR>=m.a ART.n.p dog             obl-ART.n.p dried_meat

282
Oblique-marked NPs and pronouns can form ascriptive predicates (cf. 7.9.3) and adverbial
clauses (cf. 7.12.3).
  Note that in my definition, “oblique arguments” contrast with “core arguments” in Movima.
This terminology is not intended as a theoretical statement. It contrasts with Van Valin &
LaPolla (1997:29), who make it clear that oblique arguments also belong to the core, so that
these terms should not be mutually exclusive. Further research is necessary to show which
oblique-marked NPs or pronouns belong to the core in Movima clauses, and which ones are
peripheral constituents. A distinction would then have to be made between direct core
arguments, oblique core arguments, and peripheral constituents. However, I will not go into
this problem here.","[304, 305, 306]"

with an internally cliticized referential element, they have an implicit first person singular
possessor. Secondly, they require a special suffix in order to refer to an unpossessed entity.
Non-relational nouns, in contrast, do not have an implicit first-person singular possessor when
occurring without an internally cliticized referential element.","[259, 260]"

        ‘At this hour we were already toasting chivé.’                  {EA, Chaco III 021}The conditions for the occurrence or omission of the NP in a clause containing argument
incorporation require further investigation. In elicitation, speakers usually prefer the clause
with the oblique NP, considering it “more explicit”. It can be expected that the more generic
or semantically ambiguous the incorporated element is (cf. 5.3), the more likely it is for the
free NP to occur, while with an incorporated full noun (as in (112)), this is not the case (cf.
also 9.1). However, there are also examples such as (111), where the free NP cooccurs with a
full incorporated noun. This, in turn, may be due to the fact that the story was told to me and
not to a native speaker, so that the narrator sought to be as explicit as possible. Future
research on the cooccurrence of the incorporated noun and the independent NP will, therefore,
have to involve text counts of discourse data which were produced involving native speakers
only.
   The following examples present further illustration of the use of argument incorporation.
Examples (112)–(115) are cases of occurrence of the same noun as incorporated element and
as an independent NP in adjacent clauses. In (113), the same verb root (wul-) occurs first with
an incorporated argument in an intransitive clause, and then with ARG2 as an independent NP
in a transitive clause. Note the different encoding of the second person: in the first clause, in
which the verbs contain incorporated arguments, it is encoded as ARGintr, i.e. by the proclitic
of Set 2. In the second clause, in which the arguments are not incorporated, the second person
is encoded as ARG1, i.e. by the enclitic of Set 1. From this, the first clause can be identified as
intransitive and the second as transitive.(113)   jayna ij        wul-a-wa:ris,     wul-a-sani:ya,  wul-a-ma:do,

a left-dislocated NP.(114)   di’ ij      wul-a-pe:re,        jayna      kis      pe:re, isko       en-u’-ni

        ‘If you sow plantains, then the plantains, they remain there.’    {Chaco II 036}In the first clause in (115), the noun pa:di ‘guava’ functions as a predicate nominal (cf. 7.9.1).
In the second clause, the same noun is incorporated into the verb.(115)   ja’ pa:di is             rey joy-a:-kwa, bak-a-pa:di
        just guava ART.pl again go-DR-BEN poke_at-DR-guava

The incorporated nominal element cannot be modified by a relative clause (cf. 7.11 below), as
shown by (116). In order to achieve modification or quantification of the incorporated
nominal element, an oblique NP has to be added, as in (117).(116)        * u’ko       tikoy-cha-da’ra            di’ oy-ra166

influence the valency of a verb. This is to say, a verb with an incorporated noun or bound
element can undergo voice alternations (cf. 9.2). This type of incorporation typically has a
limitative function (cf. Mithun & Corbett 1999): in the most typical case, the incorporated
element denotes the affected part of the undergoer, as in (118). In (118), it can also be seen
that a verb containing the direct voice marker remains bivalent (shown by the proclitic of Set
1 encoding the first person in (118)a); using a pronoun representing ARGintr, as in (118)b (the
proclitic of Set 2) is ungrammatical. A verb with an incorporated modifier is usually not
combined with a coreferential NP.(118)        a. loy i is-a-kwinto
                ITN 1 roast-DR-cheek
                ‘I’ll burn (your) cheek.’ [lit.: “I’ll cheek-burn you.”]             b. *loy in       is-a-kwinto

the case of argument incorporation, the direct marker can be omitted, in which case the verb is
monovalent:(119)        in      is-kwinto
             1intr roast-cheek
             ‘I burned my cheek.’ [lit.: “I got cheek-burnt.”]

6.3.3. The overt marking of non-relational nouns
Some morphemes overtly mark a noun as non-relational. The most common marker is the
suffix -kwa. As was already shown in 5.3.2, when occurring on a body-part term, this marker
indicates detachment and nonpossession:123(25)     a. di:noj        ‘my upper leg’                b. dinoj-kwa   ‘detached leg’
            cho:ra        ‘my eye’                         chora-n-kwa ‘detached eye’
            kwinto        ‘my cheek’                       kwinto:-kwa ‘detached cheek’
            woro’         ‘my throat’                      woro’-kwa ‘detached throat, neck’As could already be seen in 5.3.2 with respect to bound roots, the suffix -kwa occurs on many
bases which otherwise cannot occur independently. I will come back to these nouns in 6.5
below.
  Another suffix which derives non-relational from relational nouns is the complex
instrumental suffix -wanra or -wanrani (cf. 11.4).124 With some nouns, this suffix is necessary
in order to encode a nonpossessed entity:(26)     do’we-wanra:-ni
         my.clothes-INSTR:BE.ntr-PRC
         ‘clothes (of someone, not mine)’(27)     de-wa-wanra:-ni
         lie-?-INSTR:BE.ntr-PRC
         ‘bed, bedstead (not mine)’(28)     e -wanra
         BR.name-INSTR:BE.ntr
         ‘name’Consider also the following example, in which the speaker refers to the drawing of a finger
with a ring on it:(29)     kowa         da’          as      dimpa-n-wanra:-ni
         DM.el.n      DUR.nst ART.n finger-LN-INSTR:BE.ntr-PRC
         che as         sortija=a
         and ART.n ring=n
         ‘There is a finger and its ring.’                                                   {EA12, 285}Another complex suffix, -wawankwa, has the function of converting kinship terms into more
general terms. The resulting noun denotes the status of a person as a parent, grandparent etc.,
without relating that person to another one.125
123
    Nonpossession is relevant here. As a speaker pointed out to me, the noun dimpa-n-kwa ‘detached finger’, for
example, can only be used when referring to a cut-off finger which is not one’s own.
124
    Note, however, that nouns containing the suffix -wanra are relational when derived from a verb (cf. 11.1.6).","[258, 259]"

1 IntroductionThis book is a description of Movima, a genetically unclassified language spoken in the
Amazon area of Bolivia. This book is intended for linguists from different backgrounds, and
is not based on any particular theoretical framework.
   In the present chapter, I will give general information on Movima and its speakers. This
includes the historic, geographic and sociolinguistic background, previous research on the
language, and information on the fieldwork and data on which the present study is based. In
addition, I will give an overview of the main characteristics of Movima by comparing them to
characteristic features of other Amazonian languages. The final two sections give an outline
of the structure of the book and of the way in which the data are presented.","[21, 22, 23, 24]"

9.1.2. Properties of the incorporated element
While the previous section described verbal bases that incorporate an argument, the present
section discusses the types of elements that can be incorporated in the process of argument
incorporation.
  At the beginning of this section, examples were given that show that argument
incorporation can involve a full noun, such as saniya ‘melon’ in (1), rulrullo ‘jaguar milk’ in
(3), or jo’me ‘bird’ in (4). It can also involve a bound nominal element, i.e. a bound root, such
as mova ‘BR.litter’ in (2), a truncated form, such as -do ‘TRC.plate’ in (5), or an unanalysable
bound element, such as -ra ‘firewood’ in (6). The reasons for the choice of either a full noun
or a bound form are not entirely clear. I will outline some basic criteria.
  First of all, for some nouns, there exists no corresponding short form, such as a bound root,
truncated element, or other. These nouns can only be incorporated in their independent form,
as in the following examples:(15)    n-os         chon pul-a-lolos-wa=y’ i                    n-os        lo:los
        obl-ART.n.p HAB sweep-DR-yard-NMZ=1pl                    obl-ART.n.p yard
        ‘always when we swept the yard …’                               {EA, Aros II 032}(16)    loy in         nis-a-wenta:na
        ITN 1intr wipe_clean-DR-window
        ‘I’ll wipe the window clean.’                                       {EA 13, 163}Nouns for which there is a corresponding bound form (cf. 5.3) can either be incorporated in
their bound or in their independent form. There is no categorial restriction on this: the free
noun and the bound element can be semantically equivalent, such as is the case, for example,
with po~poy-kwa ‘animal’ and poy ‘BR.animal’ (cf. (17) below), to:mi ‘water’ and -mi
‘TRC.water’, china a ‘manioc’ and -pa ‘BE.manioc’. The independent noun can also belong
to a taxonomic class which can be represented by a bound element; examples of these are                                                                                             371
rulrul ‘jaguar’, which can be replaced by poy ‘BR.animal’, or jo’me ‘bird’, which can be
replaced by mo ‘BE.bird’.
  In (17), a case where there is a semantically equivalent bound and free form (poy and
popoykwa, respectively), both these forms can be incorporated. The only overt difference
between the two constructions is that when the bound form is incorporated, the independent
NP can be added as an oblique argument (cf. (17)a). When the independent noun is
incorporated, the additional oblique NP is considered awkward (cf. (17)b).(17)    a. loy      in     sal-a:-poy         (ni-kis              po~poy-kwa)
           ITN      1intr search-DR-BR.animal obl-ART.pl.a         RED~BR.animal-ABS
           ‘I’ll look for animals.’        b. ? loy in        sal-a-popoykwa           ni-kis           po~poy-kwa
             ITN 1intr search-DR-animal:ABS         obl-ART.pl.a     RED~BR.animal-ABS
             ‘I’ll look for animals.’                                     {EA 9, 045}The following is an example of both these constructions within one sentence, which occurred
in spontaneous discourse. The first part contains a (nominalized) verb with an incorporated
bound root (bun ‘BR.mud’) and the additional oblique NP nis bubunkwa. Here, the speaker
hesitates, not finishing the noun bubunkwa ‘mud’. She replaces the entire subordinate clause
by a clause whose predicate contains the full incorporated noun (bubunkwa ‘mud’).(18)    manes-pa-na=‘i     as       kay-a-bun-wa=i            n-is
        tasty-APPL-DR=pl ART.n eat-DR-BR.mud-NMZ-pl obl-ART.pl
        bu~bun-...,          as       kay-a-bubunkwa
        RED~BR.mud-…         ART.n eat-DR-mud:APPL
        ‘They like to eat mu-, to eat mud.’ [a joke, speaking about dark chivé mass; lit.:
        “They like the mud-eating of mu-, the mud-eating.”]           {JA, Tuncho 022}One motivation for the incorporation of a full noun instead of the corresponding bound form
may be the frequent homophony of bound elements (cf. 5.3.5). So, for example, the bound
element do can be used to refer to a plate (truncated from cha:do ‘plate’) as well to a large
round object (related to do~do:-kwa ‘big seed’). Accordingly, the verb in (19)a is more
specific than the one in (19)b, which can be made specific by adding a full NP:(19)    a. loy      in    loj-a-cha:do
           ITN      1intr wash-DR-plate
           ‘I’ll wash the dishes.’        b. loy      in       loj-a:-do      (n-is               cha:do)
           ITN      1intr wash-DR-TRC.plate obl-ART.pl          plate
           ‘I’ll wash the dishes.’                                    {HR 15, 143}In some cases, there is a difference in meaning, depending on whether the full noun or the
bound element is incorporated; consider the following example, which suggests some372
lexicalization when the bound element is incorporated:(20)    a. sal-a-to:mi
           search-DR-water
           ‘to look for water (for drinking)’        b. sal-a:-mi
           search-DR-TRC.water
           ‘to search for water underground (in order to dig a well)’ {GC 10, 155}The possibility of incorporating a full noun instead of a bound element into a verb may also
depend on the textual frequency of a verb with a particular bound element. This may be
related to the degree of institutionalization of the denoted action. For example, the complex
verbs in (21) and (22) are very frequent, and they denote institutionalized activities:(21)    a. il-a:-’oj         ‘to hang up clothes’                 (spread-DR-BE.clothes)
        b. loj-a:-’oj        ‘to do the washing’                  (wash-DR-BE.clothes)
        b. sit-a:-’oj        ‘to tailor’                          (sew-DR-BE.clothes)(22)    a. ra -a:-pa         ‘to pull out (harvest) manioc roots’ (tear-DR-BE.manioc)
        b. bo -a:-pa         ‘to scrape manioc’                   (scrape-DR-BE.manioc)
        c. ji -a:-pa         ‘to grate manioc’                    (grate-DR-BE.manioc)In contrast, it seems that the full noun is often incorporated when the action denoted by the
verb is less closely connected to a specific type of undergoer. For example, the verb root duk
‘grind’ is freely combined with bound elements referring to entities that can be ground. The
incorporation of the full noun contrasts these different types of object.(23)    duk-a-china a     ‘to grind manioc’                 (grind-DR-manioc)
        duk-a-kwajta’     ‘to grind maize’                  (grind-DR-maize)
        duk-a-pe:re       ‘to grind plantains’              (grind-DR-plantain)
        duk-a-ro:so       ‘to grind rice’                   (grind-DR-TRC.rice)
        etc.","[394, 395, 396]"

        ‘And [the agouti] could be heard in its cave.’                       {EA, Jaguar 040}A question that might be asked is what would happen if the entities denoted by these nouns
had a first-person inalienable possessor (given an appropriate context), which would not be
encoded by an enclitic and which, therefore, would not trigger the linking vowel. The answer
is that even if it were possible for these nouns to denote a part of a human, i.e., a body part,
they would not be marked for possession in this way, but by reduplication of -kwa. This
process is described in 6.5.3, and the marking of body-part terms is described in 6.6.
  When the suffix -kwa is omitted from a noun whose base has the structure CVCV, as is the
case with the nouns in (59)c., the base has to be augmented in a different manner. Due to the
vocalic ending of these bases, no linking vowel is attached which could create a base with
three moras. In order to achieve the required structure, these bases undergo infixing
reduplication. The reduplication creates a base of three syllables to which the enclitic is
attached:(72)    lo.si.si=is
        lo<si~>si=is
        resin<RED~>=pl.a
        ‘their resin (of the trees)’                            {EA 14, 083}This process is also applied to bases that already contain prefixing reduplication, as is the case
for some of the nouns listed under (59)c., e.g. ba~ba:-kwa ‘fruit’. When the suffix -kwa is
dropped here to create a possessive base, the remaining base ba~ba has to be additionally
reduplicated before the possessor is cliticized. This is illustrated by (73):(73)    jayna     lok-a:- e        is          ba~<ba~>ba=as  ko’
        DSC       fall-DR-CO ART.pl RED~<RED~>BR.round=ART.n tree
        ‘I made the fruits fall off the tree.’               {JM 16, 372b}Note that, even though these nouns denote inalienably possessed entities, I analyse the
infixing reduplication here as a purely phonological process, not as the marker of inalienable
possession described in 6.4.1. This is because, with regard to nouns ending in -kwa, the
reduplication is only found on bases with the form CVCV. If it were a semantically relevant
derivation, the infixing reduplication would be found on the other bases, too.
  Other bound roots that denote parts of wholes and display the same behaviour were given in
5.3.2.1. In difference to the bases described here, however, those roots do not normally occur
with the suffix -kwa.","[269, 270]"

1.10. The organization of this book
The organization of this book is as follows. Chapter 2 describes the phonological and
morphophonological properties of the language. In the section on intonation, the difference
between declarative and interrogative sentences is explained.
  In the first part of Chapter 3, the different morphological units and processes are introduced,
including the different kinds of cliticization by which the grammatical relations are
distinguished. The second part of this chapter provides an overview of the parts of speech in
Movima, paying special attention to the status of adjectives.
  The morphological, semantic, and pragmatic properties of the different types of referential
elements, which play a central role in the grammar of Movima, are described in Ch. 4.
  Chapters 5 and 6 deal with noun morphology. In Ch. 5, independent nouns, compounds, and
the different kinds of bound nominal elements (bound roots etc., including classificatory
elements) are described. Since possession is central for the semantic classification of nouns
and their morphological properties, this phenomenon is described separately in Ch. 6.
  Chapter 7 deals with Movima syntax. Here, clause structure and argument encoding are
described, the hierarchical alignment system is explained, and different sentence types are
presented. The syntactic effect of argument incorporation, whose morphological
characteristics are presented in Ch. 9, is also illustrated in this chapter. Chapter 7 furthermore
includes a description of the different types of subordination. In this way, negation, which is
expressed differently for main and subordinate clauses, can be described in one single section.
Coordination, which involves the combination of two main clauses, is described in Ch. 12,
which deals with the different types of coordinating particles.
  The three following chapters, 8, 9, and 10, are dedicated to verb morphology. In Ch. 8, the
intriguing system of voice and valency marking is described. Since this system interacts
closely with semantic and lexical properties of the verbal bases, the different types of verb
roots and bases are described in this chapter as well.
  Chapter 9 gives a more detailed account of complex verbal bases, which contain
morphological elements that interact with the valency of the verb. In the first part of this
chapter, the different types of noun incorporation are described: argument incorporation,
which leads to a decrease in valency, and modifier incorporation, which occurs prior to
valency assignment. The second part describes the causative, benefactive, and applicative
morphemes.
  Chapter 10 deals with other verbal morphemes, which have a modal and/or an aspectual
function. Formally, they have in common that they do not interact with verbal valency, even
though their function and productivity can be influenced by the valency properties of the base.
  In Chapter 11, nominalizing and verbalizing morphemes are presented. Some of these are
also described, where relevant, in earlier chapters, (e.g., in Ch. 3 on the noun/verb distinction,
in Ch. 7 on subordination). Since nominalization and verbalization often interact, both
processes are described together in this chapter.
  Chapter 12 gives an overview of the large class of particles. These inlude clause-
coordinating particles, TAM particles, and discourse particles.","[34, 35]"

argument (ARG2 in the direct and ARG1 in the inverse voice). The patient is usually encoded
as oblique, as shown by (132):227(132)    rim-e -na-kwa-na=us                   nono’          n-os

marker, there is no example in my corpus of a monovalent verb containing one of these
suffixes. That is, a verb with the benefactive or malefactive suffix is usually contains direct or
inverse voice marking.
  The benefactive/malefactive suffixes can occur on a causative base. The reverse order, a
causativized benefactive or malefactive base, has not been found.(133)    loy i chi-poj-na-bij-na                   us          dichi:ye no-kos

research is needed here.","[420, 421]"

that are absent from the speech situation. In the following sections, it will furthermore become
apparent that the presential forms are also used for certain referents out of existence.
Therefore, I regard the presential referential elements as pragmatically unmarked.78
4.8.2. Existence and ceased existence79
The system of referential elements not only encodes the accessibility of a referent on the
spatial, but also on the temporal level: it indicates whether the referent still exists at the time
of speaking or whether it has ceased to exist. The marking of existence is used to encode tense
in discourse in a way similar to verbal tense marking in other languages. In Movima, the only
other means of encoding tense apart from the referential elements is by particles (cf. 12.2).
Therefore, I refer to the referential elements that indicate ceased existence as “past”.80
  Existence and ceased existence are most clearly indicated by the article and by the
demonstratives, because these morpheme classes have special forms for referents that existed
in the past, but do not exist anymore on the day of speaking. In the pronominal system,
referents that have ceased to exist are encoded by the absential markers. In the present
description of the existence-marking function of referential elements, I will concentrate on the
article. A brief description of the past demonstratives will be given in 4.9.3 below, and in
4.10, I describe the interaction between the past forms of the article and the demonstratives
and the absential forms of the bound and free pronouns.
  In order to understand the categories of existence and ceased existence, it is necessary to
know the three basic temporal categories distinguished in Movima:(99)          past           =         up to and into the previous night
              immediate past =         from the night up to the moment of speaking
              non-past       =         from the moment of speaking onwardsThe general connection between these categories and the category of existence as marked by
the article is as follows: the past article is used for referents which existed up to the previous
night; the absential article is used for referents which existed on the same day, but do not exist
anymore at the moment of speaking; finally, referents which exist at the moment of speaking
or will exist in the future are encoded either by the presential or by the absential article,78
   Morphologically, however, they do not display a marked-unmarked distinction.
79
   Parts of this and the following sections were published in Haude (2004).
80
   The striking property of the Movima article to indicate “past tense” was also noted by R. Judy (1965).","[179, 180, 181]"

1.1.      The name of the language
The term Movima, pronounced [mo’ ima] in Spanish, originally refers to the ethnic group
that speaks this language. The native term is mowi:maj, pronounced [m 'wi:mah].
   The Movima language is referred to by Spanish-speaking locals as el idioma (‘the
language’) or el dialecto (‘the dialect’). In Movima, it is called chonsine (‘native language’,
literally ‘right sound’), a term also used to refer to other native languages. More specifically,
the language is referred to as chonsine di’ mowi:maj (‘native language Movima’).
   Movima is the only name known for the language. Only minor spelling differences are
encountered in the literature. In the first written record, from 1621 (cf. 1.3 below), it is
referred to as “moyma” or “moima”. Créqui-Montfort & Rivet (1914) spell it “mobima”. All
these spellings are more or less faithful to the pronunciation of the word (<v> and <b> in the
Spanish spelling represent the phoneme / /). However, Métraux (1942) confusingly spells it
as Móvima, with an accent on the o. Since stress is on the penultimate syllable, this must be a
misspelling.
   Dialectal varieties of the language have not yet been discovered.",[24]
"                                                                                                                  355
The short form of the inverse imperative can occur after the endings - e ‘CO’ (cf. 9.7) and
-kwa ‘BEN’ (cf. 9.4):(161)    kay e-n            n-as          sawi:pa,    jankwa=us
         give:CO-IMP.INV obl-ART.n machete            say=m.a

         ‘Go, my child, and fetch two buckets of water for me!’ {EA, Tomina’ 097}However, the suffixes - e and -kwa can also be followed by the long form after the
benefactive marker, as shown by (164)a and b:(163)     a. kay e-n           n-is               kana=u

marker is seen as more polite than the direct form. In many contexts, it is also possible to use
the direct form instead of the combination of the benefactive and the inverse suffix. This
difference is shown by (165)a and b:(165)     a. pat-a-poj-kwa-n                    pa’

inappropriate in many contexts. An expression which is also used to ask a favour politely is
the not completely transparent form juma’pojdo’:356

a suppletive imperative form: jay’ ‘go!’. This form can occur as a full verb, as it does in its
first occurrence in (155) above, but it also co-occurs with another imperative verb, as in its
second occurrence in (155) and in the other examples above. In this case, it has the same
distribution as the verb joyche ‘go’ in the serial verb construction described in 7.13. Another
suppletive imperative verb form is jela ‘come!’, which is related to ji<wa~>wa ‘come’.208 It
can occur as a full verb, as in (167) and (168):(167)       jela      mora’a,          jankwa=us

containing the direct marker. Examples (23) and (24) illustrate a verb with an incorporated

In a verb with an incorporated argument, and only there, the direct marker has a third
allomorph: -cha, which I gloss ‘DR2’ for reasons given below. This allomorph appears in
verbs with disyllabic roots or complex bases and precedes the incorporated argument. In some
verbs with a disyllabic root, this allomorph is found interchangeably with the base-final -na.
For example, the verb levemona in (25) has the alternative form levechamo, as in (26).(26)    loy in          leve-cha:-mo    n-is                    jo’me

        ‘I’ll chase the chickens away.’                                        {EA 13, 287h}On other disyllabic roots, only the allomorph -cha is allowed in the case of argument
incorporation. This is the case, for example, with the root tikoy- ‘kill’:(27)    a. loy in         tikoy-cha:-mo         b. * tikoy-mo:-na
           ITN 1intr kill-DR2-BE.bird                kill-BE.bird-DR
           ‘I’ll kill birds [e.g., slaughter fowls].’                          {EA 13, 155a}In examples like (26) and (27), it can be seen that the allomorph -cha has the same function as
-a and -na in (23)–(25). Like those allomorphs, it creates a bivalent base which can
incorporate the undergoer argument, which again reduces the valency of the verb. However,
the marker -cha has a special property: it also occurs on bases which are already marked as
bivalent. These bases are always complex (cf. 8.4), such as the underlined parts in the
following examples:(28)    os       rey waka:-pa di’ rey rim-a- e-cha-wa:kato:da
        ART.n.p again cow-AG REL again trade-DR-CO-DR2-cow:BR.piece

        ‘[They] sawed wood [into planks].’                               {EA, Narasa:mes 058}It can be observed here that the verbs contain two direct markers, -a and -cha, and it is
difficult to identify the function of -cha. The bases of the verbs are bivalent, rima e ‘I sell X’
and ji acho ‘I saw X open’, and the expectation would be that these bases can incorporate
their arguments just in the same way as the simple transitive bases in (23)–(25) above.
However, this is not possible: the incorporated argument has to be preceded by -cha. Here,
this element seems to be simply a morphological linker.
   Since -cha can occur in alternation with the direct marker -na in some cases (cf. (25), (26)),
it can be seen as a direct marker. When it occurs after a base with an incorporated argument,
however, it does not seem to have any valency-related property. In order to represent this
partial similarity with the direct marker, and due to the fact that it is the second voice marker
when cooccurring with the direct marker, I label it ‘DR2’.","[349, 350, 351]"

        ‘It (was) an anaconda that was holding [the dog] here.’   {EG, Sicurí 049}When the verb in the NP contains an incorporated argument, the referential properties of the
NP are slightly different. An NP with such a verb refers to the participant denoted by the
incorporated element, not to the participant which is the absolutive argument of the same verb
in predicate function. Compare the verb loja:’oj as an intransitive predicate in (181)a with the
same verb in an argument NP in (181)b:(181)   a. loj-a:-’oj--is
           wash-DR-BE.clothes--pl.a
           ‘They did the laundry.’        b. tam-vo:s-e                    is       loj-a-’oj-a=is                     juyeni

           ‘The peoples’ laundry fell down.’ [not: “the people’s washing ones fell down.”]
           {EA 19, 156}As can be seen in (181)b, when a verb with an incorporated argument occurs in an NP, it is
even possessed, despite the fact that when functioning as a predicate, it is monovalent (cf.
(181)a). The structure of (181)b would be identical if the verb did not have the incorporated
element, in which case it would be a simple bivalent verb:(182)   tam-vo:s-e                   is         loj-na=is      juyeni
        get_down-BE.wood-APPL ART.pl            wash-DR=ART.pl person

This shows that more research needs to be done on the morphosyntax of verbs with an
incorporated argument and on the role of the direct voice marker in these verbs (cf. 9.1).","[322, 323, 324]"

1.4. The situation of the language
It is conspiuous that despite the early loss of native indigenous culture, the Movima language
has been preserved until today. This can, in part, be attributed to the fact that the Jesuits
recognized the native languages and stimulated their use (cf. Crevels 2002: 13).8 However,
Movima has been maintained for at least two generations longer than many of its
neighbouring languages which were also spoken in Jesuit missions, such as the now possibly
extinct languages Canichana and Cayuvava.
   This may have to do with the fact that Movima speakers are proud of their language. This
is, for example, reflected in their awareness of linguistic purity. I have never observed code-
switching in a conversation between native speakers. When I was involved in a conversation,
some passages were explicitly translated into Spanish for me. Mixing of Spanish and Movima
is disliked. Many people who do not have a full command of Movima prefer not to speak it.
   While there are many Spanish loans in Movima, this is predominantly the case for nouns
denoting cultural items introduced by the Europeans. In at least one case, however, a Movima
noun has been replaced by the corresponding Spanish term because of its derogatory
connotation in Spanish. This is the Movima noun ku:lo ‘top’: since it is homophonous with
the familiar Spanish word ‘backside’, it has been replaced by the loan ari:wa, from Spanish
arriba ‘on top’ (Chirimani, p.c.).
   Despite the long preservation of the language, Movima is seriously endangered today (cf.
Crevels 2002: 21): there are no more children learning the language, and most fluent speakers
are over fifty years olds. This sudden change, despite the maintenance of the language
throughout the process of acculturation and the contact with white people for 300 years, is6
  This is a general phenomenon found in the Moxos region (cf. Crevels 2002: 21f.)

  However, I use the term “Movima” here for the ethnic group only.

  However, there are no written materials from the Jesuit times (cf. Montaño Aragón 1987: 241).",[27]

11.5. Action verbalization: -ti’
The nominal suffix -ti’ is the most productive verbalizing suffix. It derives monovalent verbs
from nouns:(86)        che in a       jayna     des’ayuno:-ti’,     den-cho -ba:-ti’
            and PRO.1sg DSC          breakfast-VBZ toast-BR.between-BR.round-VBZ
            ‘And I was preparing breakfast, [I] was baking “fritos”.’261  {EA, Aros 018}As is apparent from (86), the prototypical meaning of the derived verb is that it denotes the
production of the object denoted by the nominal base:(87)        juve-n-ti’           ‘to construct a dugout’       (dugout-LN-VBZ)
            bay im-ti’           ‘to work a field’             (field-VBZ)
            mo’incho:-ti’        ‘to make chivé’               (chivé-VBZ)
            roya:-ti’            ‘to build a house’            (house-VBZ)
            tijerones-ti’        ‘to make shafts’              (shafts-VBZ)In many cases, the verb with -ti’ is lexicalized and denotes the action typically associated with
the entity denoted by the base, rather than just the production of that entity. The words in (88)
are examples of this:(88)        sono-ba:-ti’         ‘to dig out turtle eggs’      (turtle-BR.round-VBZ)
            sutulra:-ti’         ‘to hunt armadillo’           (armadillo-VBZ)
            polawta:-ti’         ‘to play the flute’           (flute-VBZ)
            mi:sa:-ti’           ‘to go to mass’               (mass-VBZ)
            wa:ka:-ti’           ‘to slaughter’                (cow-VBZ)Some highly lexicalized verbs with -ti’ do also occur:
(89)        kweya-n-ti’            ‘to chat up to a woman’ (woman-LN-VBZ)
            itilakwa-n-ti’         ‘to chat up to a man’   (man-LN-VBZ)With certain bases, the interpretation of the suffix can vary between its basic meaning ‘to
make’ and a more lexicalized meaning. This can be seen in (90):(90)        kape-lo:-ti’
            coffee-BR.liquid-VBZ
            ‘to make coffee’ ~ ‘to drink coffee’The production of an object can also be expressed by the verb ji:sa:-na ‘I make X’. Possibly,
the existence of this construction makes room for the more lexicalized expressions with the
suffix -ti’. In (91)a, the building of an oxcart is expressed by an entire clause. The261
      Fritos are fried cakes with of wheat flour and cheese.","[508, 509]"

The following example is from a text:(183)   n-os           ney da’          as- e-joro:-wa,      da’        in      as- e-jo:ro
        obl-ART.n.p here DUR.nst sit-CO-sleep-NMZ DUR.nst 1intr sit-CO-sleep
        ‘At that occasion [I] was sleeping while sitting, I was sleeping while sitting.’
        {EA, Sueño 047}Two lexicalized nominal expressions which have this structure are presented in (184) and
(185). The first element denotes the position in which one carries out the action denoted by
the second verb root, which is bivalent (this only occurs in these words). The resulting words
are the names of the objects used for these activities, namely a mortar and a grinding basin.(184)   as     rey kwaderno         asko      kos   mere’            en- e:-du’u
        ART.n again notebook        PRO.n.a ART.n.a big              stand-CO-grind
        ‘My school book, that was the big mortar.’                            {BA, TX 084}(185)   che os        as- e:-du’     ney mere’ ney os                jan-tova=as
        and ART.n.p sit-CO-grind here big here ART.n.p               which-wing=n.a
        ‘And the grinding basin, this big was its breadth.’                  {BA, TX 100}9.7.4. - e on bases containing an incorporated modifier
In a few cases, - e is found after an incorporated modifier. In the following words, this is the
bound nominal element -pa, which I assume to be the truncated form of cho:pa ‘my hand’ (cf.
5.3.3):(186)   a. ten-a-pa-n- e                      b. tem-pa-n- e
           ?-DR-TRC.hand-LN-CO                   ?-TRC.hand-LN-CO
           ‘I can do X.’                         ‘[It] can be done.’(187)   ruj-a-pa-n- e
        bad-DR-TRC.hand-LN-CO
        ‘I hinder X (to do something).’Here, the function of the suffix - e cannot be determined.
  The other cases in which - e occurs after an incorporated modifier concern words which
contain the incorporated noun root kwa ‘mouth’:(188)   chok-a-kwa-n- e          ‘I cover X (so that it is invisible).’
        pok-a-kwa-n- e           ‘I cover X (in a vessel).’
        bat-a-kwa-n- e           ‘I put X on top of something.’
        vik-a-kwa-n- e           ‘I put X diagonally on top of something.’
                                                                                            409
The suffix - e clearly has an applicative function here, in that it reassigns the semantic role of
the absolutive argument. This can be seen in (189)a–c. In (189)a, where the verb lacks the
suffix - e, the absolutive argument denotes the vessel, and the incorporated noun root
indicates that the vessel is affected with respect to its opening (part-of-whole modifying
incorporation, cf. 9.2.2, 9.2.3). In (189)b, the attachment of - e allows a new participant to be
encoded as the absolutive argument. This construction follows the pattern described in 9.7.2
above for simple bivalent roots (cf. (172)–(174)). In (189)c, it is shown that the absolutive
argument of this verb cannot encode the same participant as in the unmarked form, (189)a.(189)   a. loy i         pok-a:-kwa           as wu’tu
           ITN 1         close-DR-BR.mouth ART.n pan
           ‘I’ll cover the pan (with a lid).’        b. loy i         pok-a-kwa-n- e          is     lo:kwa
           ITN 1         close-DR-BR.mouth-LN-CO ART.pl locro
           ‘I’ll cover the (pan with) locro.’        c. * loy i       pok-a-kwa-n- e          as    wu’tu
             ITN 1       close-DR-BR.mouth-LN-CO ART.n pan                     {JM 16, 180}However, an alternative analysis is also possible, which regards the element - e as belonging
to the incorporated nominal element. It is based on the fact that the word kwan e can also
occur independently with the meaning “surface, top of something”. Here, the basic function of
the element - e is to indicate that there is a particular possessor which is not the natural
possessor in the part-of-whole relation (cf. 6.4.2). An illustration is given in (190).(190)   ban-na=sne        n-as        kwa-n- e=is                     mo’incho:-bun
        put-DR=f.a        obl-ART.n mouth-LN-CO=ART.pl                chivé-BR.mass
        ‘She put (it) [a cover] on top of the chivé mass.’                  {EA, Tuncho 007}Thus, it is possible that in the verbs in (188) and (189), the entire complex noun kwan e is
incorporated into the verb, and that the scope of the suffix - e is not over the entire verb.
Under this analysis, the structure of the verb pokakwan e ‘cover something inside a container’
would be as follows:(191)   pok-a-[kwa-n- e]
        close-DR-[mouth-LN-CO]
        ‘I cover X (with respect to the opening of its container).’In conclusion, the suffix - e is most productively attached to verb roots and to bases that
contain an incorporated modifier (cf. 9.7.1). The cases in which it is attached to a verb with an
incorporated modifier are marginal and may be the result of a different morphological
process.","[431, 432, 433]"
"5.3.2.1.Reduplication of relational noun roots
Some noun roots, all of which denote inalienably possessed entities, can only occur as
independent nouns when reduplicated. These are the following:(56)    cho          ‘BR.inside’
        duk          ‘BR.back’
        loba         ‘BR.body’
        loto         ‘BR.ear’
        lowe         ‘BR.colour’
        mosi         ‘BR.lower back’Examples (57)–(59) illustrate the occurrence of these roots attached to a lexical base:(57)    mere’     rey son-lo:ba             di’ do’we=is
        big       again other-BR.body       REL clothes=pl.a
        ‘a big heap of their clothes’                               {PM, Empleada 030}(58)    os       tochi’ salon       ban-duk-a=y’ i

                                                                                           205

        ‘Then you go making holes.’                                     {EA, Chaco I 045}In order to occur as independent nouns, the relational bound roots undergo reduplication. For
the disyllabic roots, this is a single infixing reduplication:(60)    as       lo<ba:~>ba
        ART.n body<RED~>
        ‘my body’(61)    is        lo<to:~>to
        ART.pl ear<RED~>
        ‘my ears’(62)    as       lo<we~>we=a
        ART.n colour<RED~>=n
        ‘its colour’The monosyllabic bound roots, -duk ‘back’ (cf. (63)) and -cho ‘inside’ (cf. (64)) undergo a
second reduplication when occurring independently. Since I do not assume that two
reduplicative prefixes can cooccur (cf. 3.7.1), my analysis of these forms is that prefixing
reduplication comes first, and that the resulting form undergoes infixing reduplication.(63)    as     du~<du:~>du’
        ART.n RED~back<RED~>
        ‘my back’(64)    as      cho~<cho~>cho=as                  me:sa
        ART.n RED~inside<RED~>=ART.n              table
        ‘the underside of the table’Some nouns encoding inalienably possessed entities can be recognized as historically
consisting of a bound root which has been reduplicated in this way. A case in point is the term
for ‘waist’, the root of which has not been found outside this word. The only form in which it
occurs is with two reduplications, as in (65).(65)    as      kwi~<kwi~>kwi=u
        ART.n RED~<RED~>waist=m
        ‘his waist’As far as the root -duk ‘BR.back’ is concerned (the only root in this group which consists of a
closed syllable), the double reduplication only occurs with the first-person singular possessor,
in which case the noun is not combined with an enclitic (cf. 4.1; see also (63) above). When it
is combined with an enclitic, which triggers the appearance of the linking vowel -a, only one206
reduplicated element remains. Since I postulate prefixing reduplication as the earlier process,
it is this one which remains:(66)     as      du~duk-a=n
         ART.n RED~back-LV=2
         ‘your back’
5.3.2.2.Bound roots with -‘i
Some simple nouns consist of a monosyllabic root and the dummy element -‘i. The following
are the cases found so far:97(67)     ris-’i         ‘my ankle’
         kwa-n-’i       ‘my mouth’ (-n ‘LN’)
         chaj-’i        ‘my breast(s)’
         don-’i         ‘blood’
         nun-’i         ‘bone’
         maw-’i         ‘hunger’
         dam-’i         ‘louse’
         rum-’i         ‘parasite’
         kwa’-’i        ‘night heron’
         baw-’i         ‘night jar’
         paj-’i         ‘dolphin’
         ben-’i         ‘countryside, grassland’ (-ben ‘BR.flat, flexible’)The fact that the element -‘i is not an integral part of these words, but only serves the purpose
of creating a phonologically acceptable independent noun, can be seen when these words
form part of a compound (cf. 5.2) or are incorporated (cf. 9.1, 9.2). In this case, usually only
the roots remain:(68)     punta:-nun
         tip-BR.bone
         ‘the bone from the tip [of the rib cage]’                               {EA, Huesos 013}(69)     oy-baw
         two-BR.night_jar
         ‘two night jars’                                                             {JM 18, 109}(70)     kayni:-maw
         die-BR.hunger
         ‘to die of hunger’                                               {AH, Dial. EA&AH 131}97
  All nouns ending in -‘i, including those whose root is not found in other environments, are listed in Appendix
A.I.","[228, 229, 230]"
