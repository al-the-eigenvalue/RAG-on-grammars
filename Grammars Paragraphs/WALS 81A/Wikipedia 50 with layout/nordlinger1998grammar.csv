7.1 VERBLESS CLAUSES
   For the purposes of this study I will assume verbless clauses to consist of a subject and a
(usually nominal) predicate.' Note that `subject' in this context, in which it is opposed to
`predicate', is used differently than in verbal clauses, in which it is opposed to `object'.
   Verbless clauses do not contain an auxiliary, and therefore do not indicate tense. The tense
of these clauses is usually taken to be the same tense as the rest of the discourse or, if uttered
in isolation, present tense. If it is necessary for a verbless clause to be marked for past or
future tense, it can be made into a verbal clause with the use of mina `sit, be' and thereby
contain an auxiliary. The use of mina as a type of `copula' verb is discussed in §7.1.7.
   As with other types of sentences, word order in verbless clauses is relatively free; the
subject can precede (example (7-1)) or follow (7-5) the predicate, or can be discontinuous (7-
4). The subjects of these clauses are often modified (or represented) by a demonstrative that
can mark definiteness and therefore emphasise the subject. In all verbless clauses, the subject
must be in the nominative case. In ascriptive and having/lacking verbless clauses, the
predicate must also be in the nominative case and agree with the subject in both gender and
number.",[191]

                                                CHAPTER 1                         THE LANGUAGE AND ITS SPEAKERS1.1 THE LANGUAGE
    Wambaya is a non-Pama-Nyungan language from the Barkly Tablelands region in the
northern central part of the Northern Territory. It belongs to the West Barkly language
family, which occupies an area of the central Northern Territory very roughly bounded by
Daly Waters in the north-west, Borroloola in the north-east, Brunette Downs Station in the
south-east and Renner Springs in the south-west (see Maps 1 and 2). The West Barkly
languages are part of a larger subgroup known as the Mirndi group which also contains the
Jaminjungan languages: Jaminjung, Ngaliwuru and Nungali. The location of these languages
is shown in Map 1.
   Phonologically, Wambaya is fairly typical for an Australian language. The phoneme
inventory contains five places of articulation for stops (bilabial, alveolar, postalveolar, palatal
and velar), with a nasal corresponding to each stop articulation. Voicing is not phonemically
distinctive. There are three laterals corresponding to the three non-peripheral stop articulations
(alveolar, postalveolar and palatal), an alveolar tap/trill, three semivowels: /w/, Lr,,/ and /j/, and
three vowels: [i], [u] and [a], with no significant phonemic length distinction. In all of the
other West Barkly languages there is a sixth stop articulation, a dorso-palatal, described by
Chadwick (1978:9) as having an onset near the front of the velum and a palatalised release.
This stop does not occur in Wambaya and I have only ever heard one example of it in
Gudanji_ Wambaya words are mostly disyllabic or longer and, except for the auxiliary, never
end in a consonant.
   There are seven parts of speech in Wambaya: nominals (including nouns, adjectives,
demonstratives, free pronouns and time and locational nominals), verbs, adverbs, the
auxiliary (including cross-referencing bound pronouns and tense/aspect/mood/directional
suffixes), particles, clitics and interjections.
   Pronouns distinguish person (1st, 2nd and 3rd) and number (singular, dual and plural).
First person non-singular makes an inclusive/exclusive distinction, and a gender distinction is
made in the third person singular.
   Wambaya nominals generally inflect for case, gender' and number. Although there are
three numbers — singular, dual and plural — only dual nouns are obligatorily marked for
number. All modifiers must agree with the noun that they modify in all of these categories.
   There are four genders in Wambaya, marked by suffixes. In this respect Wambaya and the
other West Barkly languages are typologically aberrant, as gender in other non-Pama-
Nyungan languages, along with much of the verbal morphology, is usually marked by
prefix.'- In fact, apart from the West Barkly languages, the only other non-Pama-Nyungan    I follow Corbett (1991:5) in using this term for what are more traditionally referred to as 'noun classes'.
2   The Jarrakan languages also have genders marked solely by suffixes (Ian Green, pers.comm.).

languages which are not prefixing in at least the verbal domain a re the Tangkic languages,
such as Kayardild and Lardil.3
   The four genders in Wambaya are masculine (Class I), feminine (Class II), vegetable
(Class III) and neuter (Class Iv). Class membership is primarily semantically based. There are
two series of gender suffixes: those which occur in the nominative and accusative cases
(absolutive) and those which occur in all other cases (non-absolutive).4 Gender is marked on
nouns, adjectives, demonstratives and some indefinite/interrogatives.
   Wambaya is a `split-ergative' language: nominals (excluding free pronouns) have an
ergative-absolutive pattern of inflection while the free pronouns have a nominative/accusative
declension. Following Goddard (1982), the class of nominals as a whole is analysed as
having a three-way case system: ergative (/locative), nominative and accusative (see §4.4).
   A second position auxiliary, obligatorily present in most Wambaya clauses, contains
bound pronouns representing the subject and object arguments of the clause. This auxiliary
also contains most of the tense, aspect and mood information for the clause, and can contain
directional affixes indicating movement towards or away from the speaker. Unusually, the
auxiliary has no root.
   Some further unusual aspects of Wambaya grammar include: a subjective/objective
distinction that is made by some adjectives (see §3.1), a suffix found with kinship nominals
which appears to have a reflexive possessive function (see §4.5.1.2) and some verbs which
alternate in transitivity without changing their form (see §7.2.7).
   As is common for Australian languages, Wambaya is morphologically agglutinative and
the word order is relatively free.","[18, 19, 20]"
"
2.2.3.1 INTRAMORPHEMIC CLUSTERS
   Word-medial clusters of two consonants a re common in Wambaya. The biconsonantal
clusters that are found in the corpus are shown in Table 2.3. The initial consonant of the
cluster is shown along the vert ical axis, and the second consonant is given along the
horizontal axis. The consonan ts are given in the same order as Hamilton's continuum: labials,
dorsals, laminais and apicals (alveolars and then retroflexes). Within each group the
consonants are given in the order: stop, nasal, liquid, semivowel. Question marks indicate
what may be accidental gaps in the table.",[47]

8.2 ADJOINED CLAUSES
    In this section I discuss complex clauses that contain two finite clause constituents. These
encompass both those corresponding to finite subordinate clauses in many other languages
(i.e. the `adjoined relative clause' of Hale 1976) as well as coordinate clauses, in which
I t The data on prior subordinate clauses is too scanty to be considered here.
                                                                        Syntax of complex sentences      217neither clause is dependent on the other (e.g. those linked with such conjunctions as `and'
and `but' in English). In many Australian languages these two clause types are structurally
distinguished, one of the clauses in the former construction carrying subordinating
morphology of some kind (e.g. Gooniyandi (McGregor 1988a), Kayardild (Evans 1995a),
Warlpiri (Hale 1976)). In Wambaya, however, there is no such subordinating morphology
for finite clauses, and it is therefore difficult to find any structural basis on which to
distinguish subordination of a finite clause from simple coordination: in both cases the two
clauses are simply juxtaposed. Consider the following example:
   (8-25)     Barri          ini         ngarabi, daguma îrri-ngg-î.
              grog.I`'(ACC) 3PL.A(NP) drink          hit   3PL.A-RR-FUT
              When they drink grog, they'll fight.
              They'll drink grog (and then) they'll fight.
   Depending on the context in which it is uttered, example (8-25) could have a reading in
which the first clause provides temporal information about the main clause (i.e. Hale's (1976)
T-relative use); or one in which the two clauses are simply coordinate, each describing one of
a sequence of events.' 2
   Adjoined clauses, irrespective of their function, can never be embedded: those with
subordinate function can appear either before or after the main clause; and coordinate clauses
usually occur in the same order as the events described. These complex clauses can be
separated by a brief pause, but are bound intonationally. Usually falling intonation spans both
clauses; however, when a clause with subordinate function (usually a temporal adjunct)
precedes the main clause, it is marked with a fall—rise intonation. Thus, on prosodic bases
such as these, complex clauses can be distinguished from a sequence of two simple clauses,
which form two separate intonation units and are generally separated by a slightly longer
pause.
   This adjoined construction type in Wambaya thus serves a number of different functions,
both subordinate and coordinate. For clarity of exposition, in the following discussion I will
cover each of these types separately. Subordinate functions are discussed in §8.2.1, followed
by a discussion of coordinate clauses in §8.2.2. It should be remembered that, for the most
part, this distinction is made on a semantic/functional basis rather than a syntactic basis, and
thus may not always be clear cut.","[234, 235]"
"   Note that guyala functions both as an interjection meaning `no, nothing' and as a particle
negating a clause, as in guyala nguda yarru `I didn't go'. This is the only other exception to
the mutually exclusivity of word class membership. Interestingly Evans (1995a:87) gives
warirra `nothing' as the only Kayardild word that may belong to more than one word class,
serving both as a nominal and an interjection.' 1
3.2 GRAMMATICAL RELATIONS
3.2.1 CORE FUNCTIONS, ADJUNCTS AND COMPLEMENTS
  Grammatical relations (or grammatical functions), such as subject, object, indirect object,
complement and adjunct, are important in describing many syntactic and morphological
10 Note that the auxiliary is essentially a bundle of clitics. However, its special status in Wambaya
      grammar warrants its treatment as a distinct part of speech.
1 l Bill McGregor (pers.comm.) points out that the possible use of guyala as an interjection does not
      necessarily justify the claim that it belongs to more than one word class since it is not uncommon in
      languages for words of other classes to be used as complete utterances of their own, as in the use of
       `Man!' in English, for example. However, the two uses of guyala have different characteristics — as a
      particle, for example, guyala must co-occur with counter-factual mood marking in the auxiliary (see
       §7.6.I.1)— and thus are considered members of different word classes here.
54    Chapter 3processes in Wambaya. While these functions all have close associations with semantic roles,
the semantic roles are not necessarily invariant; a particular grammatical function may have
one semantic role with one verb, and a different semantic role with another. The role of
grammatical functions, therefore, is to provide the link between the surface morphological
and/or syntactic structure and the semantic level at which lexical predicates select arguments
with specific semantic roles (Bresnan 1982:288).
   Distinctions can be made within the grammatical functions according to two main
parameters: whether or not the function is subcategorisable by a verb, and whether the
function is semantically restricted, or semantically unrestricted.12 The criterion of sub-
categorisability separates adjuncts from other types of grammatical relations. Adjuncts are
never subcategorised for and can potentially occur with any verb. Adjuncts are semantically
transparent in that an adjunct's meaning is consistent and predictable and is not affected by
the verb with which it may occur.
   Among the subcategorisable functions, namely subject, object, indirect object and
complements, a distinction can be made according to whether or not the function is
semantically restricted (i.e. is only ever linked to an argument having a particular semantic
role) or semantically unrestricted (i.e. can be linked to any type of argument) (Bresnan
1982:293-294). Thus we can distinguish core functions (subject, object, indirect object) from
complements on this basis.13 Core functions are always subcategorisable and are
semantically unrestricted in that their meaning (i.e. their semantic role) is dependent upon the
verb of which they are an argument. Thus, the subject of one verb may have the semantic role
of agent, but that of another may be a perceiver or an undergoer. Similarly semantic roles
such as patient, perceived entity and location may all be paired with the grammatical function
of object subcategorised for by different verbs. Complements on the other hand, although
subcategorisable,14 are more closely linked with specific semantic roles and have a consistent
and predictable way of contributing to the meaning of the sentence (Andrews 1985:92).
Complements, therefore, form the middle ground so to speak, between semantically
transparent and non-subcategorisable adjuncts on the one end and semantically non-
transparent and subcategorisable core functions on the other.
   Some examples and a brief discussion of the types of complements and adjuncts found in
Wambaya follow. As the core functions are always subcategorised for, and are directly
related to, the verb of which they are an argument, they are discussed in §7.2, which deals
with the syntax of simple verbal clauses, and verb argument structures.
   Complements have invariant meanings which are related to, and easily characterised in
terms of, their case marking. Yet, unlike adjuncts, they can combine with only certain verbs,
and would therefore be part of a full dictionary entry for their governing verb. A verb such as
12 This terminology and the system of classification of grammatical relations is taken from Bresnan
    (1982:287).
13 Note that I use the term `indirect object' to refer to a type of object that is marked with an oblique case
    (usually dative). This is in contrast to what I simply refer to as `objects', which are marked with
    accusative case. Bresnan (1982) does not make such a distinction; in Bresnan's classification, these are
    both a type of object.
14 Note that there is a slight difference here in the use of the word `subcategorisable'. The sub-
    categorisability of complements is different from that of core functions in that core functions are
    generally obligatory (i.e. a transitive verb has an obligatory subject and object) while complements are
    more often optional (i.e. a verb of motion can have an optional ablative or allative complement
    indicating the source or the direction of the motion).
                                                                 Parts of speech and other preliminaries   55junmi `cut' can take a complement indicating the instrument used (example (3-17)); and
motion verbs such as bardgu `fall' and yarru `go' can take a complement in the allative case
(3-18) or the ablati ve case (3-19) denoting the direction or source of the movement.
     (3-17) Junmi wurlu-ngg-a jabarrini-ni.

            I came from a long way.
   Some verbs subcategorise for . `subject complements' — secondary predicates sub-
categorised for by the verb and agreeing in case, number and gender with the subject. An
example of this is the verb manku in its sense 'to feel', which subcategorises for a reflexive
object and a subject complement denoting the state of affairs of the subject:
     (3-20) Manku ngî-ngg-a baginga.
            feel      I SGA-RR-NF bad.II(NOM)
            I feel no good.
   Similarly, perception verbs can subcategorise for what could be considered an `object.
complement' — a secondary predicate which modifies the object, denoting the state in which
the object is perceived:15
     (3-21) Ngajbi ng-a          alaji
            see      ISG.A-PST child.i(ACC) alone.I(ACC)
            I saw the boy alone.
   Like complements, adjuncts have consistent meanings which remain unaffected by the
nature of the verb with which they occur. However; unlike complements, adjuncts are not
selected by verbs and can potentially co-occur with any type of verb in a clause. Typical
examples of adjuncts include locative phrases (example (3-22)), temporal phrases (3-23),
benefactive dative phrases (3-24) and secondary predicates (3-25).

7.5.2 INFORMATION QUESTIONS
   These questions involve the use of an indefinite/interrogative, usually initial in the clause,
that indicates the nature of the information being sought. As in many Australian languages,
indefinite/interrogatives in Wambaya can be used either in interrogative function (e.g. `who',
`what') or as indefinite pronouns (e.g. `someone', `something'). They contain one of five
basic roots: gayinî- `what, who'; inja- `where, which'; yangula `when'; yangulanji `how19 Based on the forms of the auxiliaries and the negative particles he recorded, as well as some of the lexical
    items.

marking in order to cover such meanings as `who, what, with what, for what' and `which,
where to, where from' respectively. Some examples of the interrogative uses of these forms
follow; indefinitermterrogatives are discussed in more detail in §4.7.

                                            PREFACE
   Wambaya is a non-Pama-Nyungan language originally spoken in the Barkly Tablelands
region of the Northern Territory, Australia. There are perhaps 8-10 fluent speakers
remaining, most of whom live in Tennant Creek and Elliott in the Northern Territory. The
linguistic work which led to this volume was initiated by the Wambaya community (through
the Gurungu Council Aboriginal Corporation in Elliott) out of an increasing concern for the
fate of their language as these few remaining speakers get older. It is hoped that this
(ongoing) work will help younger Wambaya speakers learn something of their language
now, and have some access to their language even when it is no longer being spoken around
them.
   While the main focus of this work has been on Wambaya, substantial reference has also
been made throughout the text to the mutually intelligible dialect Gudanji. The close and long-
term interaction between the Wambaya and Gudanji communities makes it virtually
impossible to work on one dialect without working on the other. Furthermore, the similarly
small number of remaining Gudanji speakers makes any work on this dialect equally urgent.
   The research for this grammar was conducted during six field trips, totalling over seven
months, from February 1991 to August 1994. Work was begun in Elliott, N.T., and then, as
many Elliott Wambaya moved to Tennant Creek, was continued there. There was a lot of
support for the project from the Wambaya/Gudanji people of both Elliott and Tennant Creek.
Although people were not always able to to help me with language material, help came in
many different forms: from helping with the elicitation and transcription of stories, to
providing access to computers and office space, to providing company for the many hours
spent driving between Elliott and Tennant Creek.
   This grammar is a revised version of my Melbourne University MA thesis (Nordlinger
1993a). The revisions include the reanalysis of some earlier analyses (e.g. the treatment of
complex clauses in Chapter 8), and the inclusion of new data collected since the MA thesis
was submitted (e.g. the causal suffix in §4.4.9). Unfortunately, the constraints of time have
made it impossible to cover all areas of Wambaya grammar in the same amount of detail.
Wambaya is a morphologically complex language, and thus these aspects of the grammar
have been given the most attention (Chapters 4-6); other areas have been given less coverage
than they deserve (e.g. complex sentences); and still others have been left out altogether (e.g.
prosody, discourse). Throughout the text I have indicated areas in which more work is
needed in the hope that it can be carried out in the future.
   This grammar is written as a reference grammar. I have therefore deliberately avoided
presenting the data in any particular theoretical framework, or devoting much discussion to
the interesting issues raised by aspects of Wambaya grammar for current theoretical research.
Instead I have tried to describe this interesting language in its own terms, using a substantial
number of naturally occurring examples and texts. My belief is that this will give the
grammatical description the best chance of standing the test of time, and readers the best
chance of discovering things in the language that I have not, perhaps even inspiring more
work on Wambaya before it is too late.                                               xi

          He must be cold (because he's only wearing shorts).
  However, =miji can also be used where the conclusion drawn is more tentative. In this use
=mijî expresses possibility, rather than probability, and is more like the English modal
'might'.

which they indicate a lack of knowledge without asking that the information be supplied. This
function is discussed and exemplified more fully in §4.7. Examples include:
   (7-189) Gayinirna=miji       nayida             ng-u       yany-ba agardi-nka.
           what.II(ACC~INFER woman.II(ACC) 1 SG.A-FUT get-FUT wash-DAT
           I don't know which girl I'll get to wash (my clothes).
  (7-190) Wunjugu=miji     irr-a    ginganbi garnguji-rdarra.
          somehow=LNFER 3PL.S-PST drown many.I-GROUP(NOM)
          Somehow they all drowned (but I don't know how).
   In the only example in the corpus where =mijî is not encliticised to the initial element in the
clause, it has this function:
   (7-191) Darrgulumî îrr-a        ngarra    banjangani gayinini-ni=miji.
           crack       3PL.A-PST 1SG.OBL behind           someone.I-LOC=INFER
           Someone must have let the water out behind me.
   The use of =miji with indefinites is similar to that of the particle /pangkal/ `might be, may
be' in Warumungu, which is used to create indefinites from interrogatives (Jane Simpson
pers.comm.). It is also similar to the use of the ignorative clitic =ga in Ngiyambaa
(Donaldson 1980:258ff).27 Note that 'might be' can be used in Aboriginal English in the
same way: Where is X? Might be somewhere.28
73.1.2 =-- NIMA 'JUST'
   The clitic =nima is a restricted clitic that has a number of related emphatic functions,
translating English words such as 'just', 'only' and 'still'. It is most commonly used with
nouns and adjectives, but can also be used with other parts of speech such as verbs (example27 However, the clitic =ga in Ngiyambaa has a different meaning than =miji in wamhaya. as its use with
    other word classes is inferred to be a request for the hearer to affirm or deny the correctness of the
    statement (Donaldson 1980:260). The use of =miji has no such implicature.

examples, the constituent carrying =nima is usually, but not always, clause-initial.

   It is possible for both the head noun and a modifier to host =nîma:

           ISG.POSS.IV(ACC)=JUST tobaccodV(ACC)=JUST ISG.A(PR) RDP-carry
           I carry around my own tobacco.
    In one example =nîma appears within the word giliyaga 'there'. This word is made up of
gilî `here' and the remote suffix -yaga (this suffix is found on most remote demonstratives;
see §4.6).
   (7-199) Mirra g-a            gili=nîma-yaga.
           sit     3SG.S-PST here=JUST-remote
           I stayed right there.
    The different uses of =nima are related by the fact that they all se rve to modify
presupposed expectations; the clitic functions as an expectation modifier (McConvell 1983),
highlighting deviation from a presupposition that something more or different would be
expected. In example (7-192), for instance, =nima denies the presupposition that the speaker
would have been given both meat and bread; in (7-195), it denies an expectation that the
travellers would have arrived at their destination already; and in (7-199) the function of =nima
is to deny the presupposition that the speaker went anywhere else. The 'counter-expectation'
meaning of (7-198) is not so obvious. However, this utterance was given in a context in
which the speaker was complaining about the fact that people always come and ask her for
                                                                          Syntax of simple sentences     207tobacco. Thus, =pima seems to be used to assert that the tobacco she carries is for her use
only, and not for anyone else' s 29
7.7.1.3 =MINY/ `AGAIN'
   The clitic -minyi `AGAIN' is used only with verbs. It is attached to the verb over which it
has scope. There are only a few examples of this clitic in the corpus, including:
     (7-200) Bardgu-j-ba=minyi g-u        galyurrungurna.
             fall-TH-FUT=AGAIN 3SG.S-FUT rain.II(NOM)
             It'll rain again.
     (7-201) Gannga=minyi              g-ulama.
              re turn(FUT)AGAIN 3S G. S-NP.T W D
              She'll come back again.
     (7-202) Gulugi-nka=minyi gi-n                   yugu.
             sleep-DAT=AGAIN 3SG.S(PR)-PROG cry
             He's crying to go back to sleep (i.e. because he's tired).
   As can be seen in the examples above, =minyî can be used with either of the two senses
that McConvell (1983) identi fies for English `again': (i) repetition of an action or situation
and (ii) return to a former position or state. In example (7-200) =minyi indicates repetition of
the full situation: it is true that the event of raining will be repeated. In (7-201) and (7-202) on
the other hand, =minyi indicates only a return to a former state or position, rather than a
repetition of the whole event. Thus (7-202), for example, means that `he' was asleep before
and that he is crying in order to return to that former state of sleeping. It does not mean that
the event of his crying has happened before and is now being repeated. Similarly, (7-201)
describes the situation in which `she' was here and will return to this former position. It does
not refer to a repetition of the event of returning.","[222, 223, 224, 225]"

3.2.2 DEFINING SUBJECT, OBJECT AND INDIRECT OBJECT
   Following are the properties by which subjects, objects and indirect objects can be
characterised and identified in Wambaya.
SUBJECT I7  (i)      Subject NPs take either the ergative case (A) or the nominative case (S).
 (ii)      In a main verbal clause or a finite subordinate clause, the subject is represented by a
           bound pronoun in the first position in the auxiliary.
 (iii)     In a non-finite subordinate clause the subject is the pivot and is obligatorily omitted,
           being identical to a core argument of the main clause (see §8.1).
 (iv)      In a simultaneous non-finite subordinate clause in which the verb is inflected with the
           nominal suffix -nî, the main-clause subject is that which is co-referential with the
           (omitted) subordinate-clause subject.
 (v)       In a reduced adjoined clause the subject is the pivot and is omitted, being co-
           referential with the subject of the preceding clause (see §8.2).18
16 I have not tested the limits of these combinations. For example, what is the limit on the number of non-
     core functions that can occur within a clause? And is it possible to have the complete set of dative
     functions within the one clause? Consider, for example, 'I talked to the woman (indirect object) about
     language (complement) for money (adjunct)'.
17 Note that this discussion does not help to identify or define the properties of a subject in a verbless
     clause. There are often difficulties with formally identifying the subject in such clauses (e.g. see Morphy
     (1983) on Djapu). Verbless clauses are discussed in §7.I.
18 In a non-reduced adjoined clause, the subject can be identified from the auxiliary by (ii).
                                                        Parts of speech and other preliminaries   57OBJECT
  (i) Object NPs take the accusative case.
 (ii) First and second person objects are represented by a bound pronoun in the second
      position in the auxiliary. ('Third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary; see
      §5.2).
      The main-clause object is that which is co-referential with the (omitted) subject of a
      simultaneous non-finite subordinate clause in which the verb is inflected with the
      infinitive suffix -barda (see §8.1).
    Some ditransitive verbs subcategorise for two accusative objects, only one of which is
registered in the auxiliary (see §7.2). I thus make a distinction between direct objects, to
which the above three generalisations apply, and second objects, which are characterised by
(i), but not (ii) and (iii).
INDIRECT OBJECT
   The evidence for indirect object is considerably weaker than that for subject and object.
Indirect objects are marked with the dative case and are never represented in the auxiliary and
are thereby distinguished from subjects and objects. Indirect objects can be distinguished
from dative adjuncts and complements in that they are subcategorisable and semantically
unrestricted, and are thereby core functions. In addition, unlike other complements and
adjuncts, some indirect objects can feed reflexive and/or reciprocal constructions, in which
case the indirect object argument is registered on the auxiliary with the reflexive/reciprocal
pronoun (see examples (3-29) and (3-30)). As shown in (3-31) to (3-34), this is not possible
for dative adjuncts.

                                             NOMINALS4.1 THE STRUCTURE OF THE NOMINAL WORD
  The structure of the nominal word is:1
      Root + (deriv) + (adnom) + (number) + gender# + ([GEN + gender*j) + (case)
     deriv = A derivational suffix (§4.5)
     adnom = The proprietive suffix (§4.4.11), privative suffix (§4.4.12) or `origin'
           suffix (§4.4.13)
     GEN   = The genitive suffix (§4.4.10)
           The only situation in which this slot is not obligatory is when the dual number
           suffix is present.
     *     This gender slot must agree with the gender of the possessed noun.
   There are no examples in the corpus in which case marking follows the genitive suffix,
although such constructions are accepted by speakers as grammatical. There are also no
examples in which a derivational suffix is followed by an adnominal suffix, although it is
conceivably possible in a word such as ?yugu-warli-ngunya `cry-AGNT.I-PROP.II(NOM)'
meaning `(woman) having a crying (child)'.
   Although there is not an example in which all of these slots are filled, the following few
examples attest to the above ordering and degree of complexity.
  ROOT + ADNOM + NUMBER + GENDER + CASE:
  (4-1) gijilulu-nguj-ball-nî-ni
        money-PROP-PL-I-LOC
        the men with money (ergative/locative)
  ROOT + DERIV + NUMBER + GENDER + CASE:
  (4-2) ngara-barli-marnda-nga-ni
        drink-AGNT-PL-II-LOC
        the women drunks (ergative/locative)
  ROOT + GENDER + GEN + GENDER:
  (4-3) bungma-nyi-niganka (maga)
        old.man I GEN.IV       (camp.w(NOM))
        the old man's (camp) (nominative)
   Some of the adnominal and number suffixes are inconsistent as to the form of the nominal
that they take as their stem. While most suffixes are attached to the root of the nominal, there
are some examples in which such suffixes take the citation form of the nominal, including the
gender suffix, as their stem. For example the number suffix -rdarra `GROUP' (see §4.3.3.4)
always follows gender marking, unlike the other plural suffixes which must precede gender
marking (see examples (4-1) and (4-2) above):    This template does not represent the structure of demonstratives or pronouns. These nominal subtypes
    are discussed in §4.6 and §4.8 respectively.
                                                   58
                                                                                            Nominals     59    (4-4) garngu-nva-rdarra
          many-II-GROUP(NOM)
          a big group (of women) (nominative)
   Other suffixes, such as the proprietive suffix, attach to the root of some nominals
(example (4-5)) and to the citation form of others (4-6). One possibility is that the root
functions as the stem when the gender of the 'base' nominal is unimportant, but that the
suffix follows the citation form when the gender of the underived noun is relevant. For
example, there may be alternative forms of (4-5) such as ala-jî-ngunya `child-I-PROP.II(NOM)''
meaning 'female with boy child' and ala-nga-ngunya `child-II-PROP.II(NOM)' meaning `female
with girl child'. However, this question will need to be followed up in the field.
    (4-5) alag-unya
          child-PROP.II(NOM)
          female with child
    (4-6) mangany-ma-ngunya2
          tucker-III-PROP.II(NOM)
          female with tucker
   These examples suggest that the above nominal template should include a provision in the
root slot for another optional gender marker, with the restriction that it is only filled in some
nominals that contain either the proprietive or privative suffix, or when the -rdarra number
suffix is present. The revised nominal word template would then be as follows:
    [Root (+gender)] + (deriv) + (adnom) + (number) + gender + ([Gen + gender]) + (case)
with the same conditions and abbreviations as given above.","[74, 75, 76, 77]"
"
24 This stem is segmentable into the verb root dagunia. and the thematic consonant j; see §6.1.
25 The following discussion is based on the discussions of foot and metrical phonology contained in Durand
    (1990), Goldsmith (1990) and Nespor and Vogel (1986). It has also benefited from some helpful
    comments from John Hajek and Juliette Blevins. Although I have presented a cyclic, derivational account
    of stress placement, it would also be possible to reformulate this account within a constraint-based
     framework such as Optimality Theory (Prince and Smolensky 1993).
26 Poser (1989) gives an account of the stress patterns in Diyari and Warlpiri without reference to specific
     morphological structure. In his analysis, stress assignment occurs cyclically and begins by moving from
     left to right. However, in order to account for the behaviour of successive degenerate feet which join
     together to make one foot, Poser postulates a rule termed Merger which links degenerate feet into binary
     feet, this time moving from right to left. Poser's account would also work for Wambaya, but the one
     given here is preferred as it avoids the need to be multidirectional. Furthermore, as the constraint against
     stress referring to specific morphological structure does not hold universally — e.g. Mayali (Evans
     1995b), Gooniyandi (McGregor 1990) — I do not think that there is a problem with morphologically
     sensitive stress placement rules.
                                                                           Phonetics and phonology 35
  b. If there are no heavy syllables, scan again from left to right and assign left-headed
      binary feet to each morpheme, beginning with the first syllable. If the morpheme is
      monosyllabic, making a binary foot impossible, assign a strong degenerate foot. Note
      that at this point there may be syllables as yet unassigned to feet.
(ii)a. Again moving from left to right, group two successive degenerate feet into one left
       headed binary foot.
  b. Group a degenerate foot with a preceding unattached syllable forming a left-headed.
      binary foot.27
(iii) Non-branching feet that do not carry primary word stress (i.e. those that are not initial
      and/or do not contain a long vowel) are deleted.
(iv) Stray syllable adjunction: all unattached syllables are attached directly to the prosodic
     word.
   Rule (i)a accounts for the fact that a long vowel is stressed even when it is not in the initial
syllable. Some examples follow; see example A below for a sample derivation:
   la. Nga.'naa.rra Brunette Downs Station
    b. ga.'laa        bone
    c. ga.'rdaa.la    gidgee tree
   According to Rule (i)a foot formation will not begin with the first syllable of these words,
but with the first heavy syllable (i.e. the second syllable). The first syllable will at this stage
remain unassigned, as in example A below.
    Rule (i)b applies to morphemes that do not have heavy syllables (note that long vowels are
very rare in Wambaya, so this type of morpheme is the most common). According to Rule
(i)b, if (i)a cannot apply (because there are no heavy syllables), foot formation begins with
the initial syllable of the morpheme. As feet must be binary, the final syllable of a morpheme
having an odd number of syllables will remain unassigned. See examples B and C below for
sample derivations.
    Rules (ii)a and (ii)b account for the behaviour of monosyllabic suffixes which, by virtue
of the second part of Rule (i)b, all now belong to degenerate feet. It is important that (ii)a
precede (ii)b as monosyllabic suffixes are grouped only with a preceding unattached syllable
if there is not another monosyllabic suffix to their right with which they can group. The
specification in (ii)b that the resulting foot be left-headed, combined with the fact that all feet
are quantity sensitive in Wambaya, ensures that (ii)b will not apply to the second syllable of a
word such as ga.'laa, which forms a degenerate foot due to (i)a. Sample derivations
concerning Rules (ii)a and (ii)b are D and E below.
   Rule (iii) is necessary to account for the fact that if a monosyllabic suffix (which belongs
to a degenerate foot due to (i)b) is not part of a binary foot after the application of Rules (i)
and (ii), it is unattached from foot structure at this stage and is later attached by Rule (iv). An
example of the application of Rule (iii) is in example F below.
  Rule (iv) attaches all remaining unattached syllables directly to the prosodic word.
Examples of the application of this rule are in examples A, B, D, and F below. The feet that27 Note that, since all feet are quantity sensitive, if the degenerate foot contains a long vowel and is the
    second syllable of a monomorphemic word (e.g. garnaa), (ii)b will not apply.

according to the following rule:

rules. Syllables attached directly to the word level by Rule (iv) are shown with a broken line.

vowels. In §2.1.4 a distinction was made between these long vowels and phonetic long
vowels which are derived through regular language-internal processes of elision. An example
of a phonetic long vowel is that which is derived from the elision of the semivowel /w/ when
the dual suffix is added to the nominal darranggu:
       darranggu + wulu tree + DU > /darranggu + ulu/ ['drri t,gu ,u1u]
   Note that the assignment of stress must precede the morphophonemic process of elision as
these phonetic long vowels do not have primary stress (as a phonemic long vowel would),
and are treated as a sequence of two vowels, with the second carrying stress as it is the initial
syllable of a polysyllabic morpheme.
38     Chapter 2   The rules of stress placement in Wambaya are still not yet fully understood and further
research may lead to a different analysis of stress placement than presented here. While the
rules for foot and word construction given here account for the large majority of the corpus,
there are some unpredictable forms that these rules do not account for. A couple of these
exceptions follow (along with the expected pattern according to the above rules):
       'wug.ba.,rdij.+ba.,rli. + ma (expected:'wug.ba.rdij.+,ba.rli.+rna) cook+AGNT+ll
       'na.nga.na.,nga.li           (expected:'na. nga.,na.nga.li)       sneak away
     There is clearly need for more research in this area.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56]"

4.4.3 ERGATIVE/LOCATIVE/INSTRUMENTAL CASE
   There is one case that covers all of the ergative, locative an d instrumental functions. This
case suffix is consistently glossed `LOC' and is referred to in discussion as the `ergative/
locative' case. `LOC' has been chosen to gloss this case suffix as the locative function seems
more semantically basic: extensions of locative to instrumental (e.g. in Pitjantjatjara (Blake
1977:44)) and of instrumental to ergative (e.g. in Kune (Nick Evans, pers. comm.)) are
widely attested, but it seems more unlikely that an ergative suffix would have been extended
to cover locative functions 25 Although there is formally just one case, the ergative, locative
and instrumental functions can be distinguished from each other on functional and syntactic
grounds. This is discussed in more detail below.26
25  Note, however, that this is purely speculative. Further investigation is required in order to substantiate
    this claim for Wambaya.
26 The Jaminjungan languages also have one case morpheme which covers all three of ergative, locative and
     instrumental functions (Hoddinott and Kofod 1976:397). In Ngaliwuru and Jaminjung the basic form is
     the same as in Wambaya: -ni. In Nungali, in which the situation is a little more complicated, the most
    common ergative/locative case markers are either the prefix nyi- or the suffix -ni (Hoddinott and Kofod
     1976:397).
     Wagaya, a language spoken immediately to the south-east of Wambaya, also has one form which is used
     for ergative, instrumental and locative cases (Breen 1976:340), although this suffix (-1. -g or -dy) is very
                                                                                           Nominais     83   The following examples demonstrate the use of the one ergative/locative case marker in all
three case functions:
   (4-67) Janmajardi wurlu-ng-a darranggu-wuli-ji.

          I'm sitting on top of two sticks.
a) Form
   The ergative/locative suffix has 4 allomorphs with -ni being the basic, general form. Of the
other three allomorphs one is phonologically conditioned (-nu) and two are morphologically
conditioned, occurring in very restricted environments.
   The allomorph -nu follows u-final stems. Its occurrence is optional in this environment; it
is equally as acceptable to use the regular form -ni:
  (4-70) Ngabulu-nu ngiyi-ng-agba     dawu murlu.
         milk ry-LOC 3SG.NM.A-IO-HYP bite eye.IV(ACC)
         The sap might sting my eyes.

         stick.ry-LOC     3SG.NM.A- I O-NF scratch
         The stick scratched me.
   The ergative/locative suffix -ji is found only after the dual suffix. There does not seem to
be any phonological motivation for the irregular form of this suffix. Examples include (4-67)
to (4-69) above, and the following:
  (4-72) Bungmaj-bull jî    wurl-aji           daguma juwarramba.
         old.person-DU-LOC 3DU.A-HAB.PST hit            men.I(ACC)
         The old women had been killing all the men.
  (4-73) Barraala                 dunkala      wurlu-n        baba-wuli-ji.
         white.cockatoo.11(ACC) chase.away 3DU.A(NP)-PROD sibling-Du-LOC
         The two brothers are disturbing the white cockatoos.    different in form from the Wambaya suffix. And in Warumungu (spoken immediately to the south of
    Wambaya) the ergative case marks instrumental and locative functions (Heath and Simpson 1982:20).
    However, as Jane Simpson points out (pers.comm.), the coalescence in these languages is probably due
    to a collapse of forms rather than the development of one case marker out of another: in Warumungu,
    complete vowel assimilation causes the collapse of ngka 'LOC' and -ngki, -ngku 'ERG'; and in Wakaya,
    the neutralisation of the case distinction was brought about by final vowel loss.
    Chadwick (1976:393) suggests that in an earlier stage of the West Barkly languages, nouns may not have
    been marked for ergative function and that the modern ergative (/locative) case suffixes may have
    developed from a gender marker of a third person element in the noun phrase. The fact that -ni is also a
    common Class I non-absolutive gender suffix in Wambaya may lend some support to this theory, as
    does the fact that both Jingili (Chadwick 1975:16-17) and Nungali (Bolt, Hoddinott and Kofod 197I b:68-
    69) have portmanteau forms that mark both gender and case. While Wamhaya makes a distinction in the
    gender suffixes between absolutive case and non-absolutive case, in Wambaya, unlike in Jingili and
    Nungali, it is necessary also to affix a separate case suffix to these gender suffixes.
84 Chapter 4   Two non-absolutive gender suffixes found only with certain kinship nouns condition an
irregular ergative/locative allomorph -yi. These are the Class I non-absolutive suffix -na and
the Class II non-absolutive suffix -ga.27 Some examples are:28
   (4-74) Guguga-yi ngîy-a           wugbardî ngarra.
            MM.II-LOC 3SG.NM.A-PST cook         ISG.OBL

            MB.I-LOC 3SG.M.A-PST.TWD bring
            Uncle brought him.
   In all other environments -nî is the only ergative/locative allomorph that occurs.
b) Function
   The ergative/locative case covers a large range of functions: from marking the subject of a
transitive clause to marking the location of an event. The distinction between ergative,
locative and instrumental functions can be made on functional and syntactic grounds. The
ergative function always marks the subject of a transitive or ditransitive verb; the instrumental
function marks an instrument; and the locative function marks the location or position of an
entity or event. Syntactically, a NP in the ergative function is always represented in the
auxiliary with a bound pronoun, while a NP in either the locative or instrumental functions is
never represented in the auxiliary. The locative function can be distinguished from the
instrumental function on the basis of co-occurrence restrictions: a NP in the locative function
can include locational nominals such as jangi `down' (example (4-85)) and can be replaced
with locative demonstratives such as gîliyaga `there', while a NP in the instrumental function
can not.
   The ergative function marks the subject of transitive and ditransitive verbs. An example of
each is given below.
   (4-76) Gujîga-yi      gurlaganga-ni ngiyi-ny-a      gurla   yagu.

          old.man.I-LOC 3SG.M.A-IO-NF give

   The following examples demonstrate the use of the ergative/locative to mark instrument:

"
11    It is not uncommon for a marker of progressive aspect also to indicate other events of the same type
      which occur during a period of time. See, for example, Chung and Timberlake (1985:213ff.).

             Cars were passing by us (all night).
   The conditions of use of this suffix seem to differ from speaker to speaker. One speaker
for example (MG), includes it in the present tense forms of all auxiliaries that do not have an
object bound pronoun. Thus for this speaker it seems to simply mark present tense in
auxiliaries without objects (see examples (5-49) and (5-50)).
   (5-49)    Mîrra irri-n                 jamba-ni.           (not irrt)

             sweat       2SG.S(PR)-PROG
             You're sweating.
   Other speakers (e.g. MH) however, do not use this suffix in this way, and restrict its use
to constructions such as examples (5-45) to (5-48) above.12 Note however, that this suffix
does not appear in all progressive constructions, and it is in fact more common for it to be
absent (especially when the auxiliary contains an object):
   (5-51) Nyurrunyurru ngîyî-ng-a.
            chase            3SG.M.A-10-NF

             fight     3PL.A-RR-NF
             They're fighting.
   More work is needed in order to properly determine the meaning an d function of this
suffix. For the purposes of this work I will refer to it as a progressive marker (and gloss it
`PROG'), although this may not turn out to be the best characterisation of its meaning and
function.","[165, 166]"

8.2.1 SUBORDINATE FUNCTIONS
   Adjoined clauses can have one of three subordinate functions: (i) they can function as
adjuncts to the main clause, supplying temporal or causal information (§8.2.1.1); (ii) they can
function adnominally, modifying a matrix NP (§8.2.1.2) and; (iii) they can function as
arguments for certain speech and perception verbs (§8.2.1.3). The former two functions are
referred to by Hale (1976) as `T-relative' 13 and `NP-relative' respectively. As mentioned
12 Although there can be some slight differences in intonation — see below.
13 In fact, Hale's 'T-relative' function is only when the two clauses make identical time reference (p.79), so
    does not cover the causal function. Hale discusses this function separately (p.81).
218     Chapter 8above, none of these functions is distinguished formally in Wambaya and it is generally only
contextual information which determines the specific interpretation for the clause.' 4
8.2.1.1 ADJOINED CLAUSES AS ADJUNCTS TO THE MAIN CLAUSE

   In the above examples the subordinate clause follows the main clause. When the
subordinate clause describes an event which immediately precedes and causes that described
by the main clause, the temporal adjunct often precedes the main clause. In these
constructions, the subordinate clause is marked with a fall—rise intonation and is separated
from the main clause by a pause:

    to be distinguished on the basis of such things as tense/mood sequences and differences in word order.
    More Wambaya data is needed before it can be determined whether such things are also significant in
    these clauses in Wambaya.
15 Note that the auxiliary of the second clause has been omitted here. This is . reasonably common,
    especially with coordinate clauses; see §8.2.2 below.

   One type of main clause adjunct is the conditional subordinate clause. In this type of
construction the subordinate clause (i.e. the `condition') precedes the main clause and both
clauses have the same tense/mood marking: either future tense marking (example (8-36)), or
irrealis mood marking (8-37).

   Note that examples (8-32) and (8-33) in certain contexts could also be interpreted as
conditional clauses, in which case they would be translated 'If the old man comes back, we'll
ask him' and 'If the bus starts moving, I'll fall asleep', respectively.","[235, 236, 237]"

1.2.3.2 KINSHIP TERMINOLOGY
    The Wambaya kinship terms are given in Figures 1.2 (male ego) and 1.3 (female ego). As
is common in Aboriginal Australia, this is a classificatory kinship system: these kinship terms
are used for anyone in the appropriate category, regardless of whether they are actual
consanguineal or affinial relatives. Another characteristic of this system, also common in
Australia, is that same-sex siblings are treated alike. For example, a woman calls her sister's
children by the same terms that she uses for her own; likewise a man with his brother's
children. Similarly, parallel cousins (i.e. the children of same-sex siblings) are treated as
siblings. Where there are two terms for a category in the charts below, the first refers to the
younger sibling and the second to the elder sibling. One's parents are referred to with the
same term as for their younger sibling. Thus:
      F
      irda
      barnangîla
means that îrda is the term for both father and father's younger brother and barnangila is the
term for father's elder brother.
   I have not given any of the synonyms for these kinship terms. Synonyms and near
synonyms can be found in the word list in Appendix D.
   Note that the cyclical nature of this system means that kin types can be defined in a number
of different ways: for example, one's `mother' (M) could also be one's `brother's son's wife'
(BSw); and one's `mother's mother' (MM) could also be one's `cousin's wife' (FZSw). To
avoid cluttering, I have not listed every possibility in the charts but leave it to the reader to
trace these alternative relationships themselves, if desired, using Table 1.3 above.
   It is important to note that only a limited amount of work has been done in the area of
Wambaya kinship and that, as indicated by the queries in the following charts, more research
is needed.

terms can be formed with the suffix -gulanji/-gulanga, discussed in §4.5.1.3. Kinship terms
can also be inflected with the suffix -liji, which appears to be a reflexive-possessive suffix
indicating that the `possessor' of the kin is the subject (or the topic) of the clause. This suffix
is discussed in §4.5.1.2.

   The phonemes for Wambaya are given in Table 2.1 below. The orthographic symbol for
each phoneme is given in parentheses following the IPA symbol. Note that, as voicing is not
distinctive in Wambaya, the decision to use the voiced IPA stop symbols in Table 2.1 is
arbitrary, although it reflects the Wambaya community's choice of orthography. For the rest
of this chapter I will use the orthographic symbol to represent the phoneme (e.g. In not /.V).
Long vowels are given below in parentheses to indicate their rarity. There are only a handful
of words with long vowels in the corpus; these are discussed in §2.1.4.

   As shown in Table 2.1, the Wambaya phoneme inventory contains five places of
articulation for stops including two apical series and one laminal series. There is a nasal
corresponding to each stop articulation and a corresponding lateral at each non-peripheral
place of articulation. There is an alveolar tap/trill and three semivowels: labio-velar /w/,
retroflex /r/, and lamino-palatal /y/. There is a three-way vowel contrast with a very limited
length distinction; long vowels are found in only a handful of words — see §2.1.4.
   Although the orthographic symbols for each of the individual phonemes are given above,
in order to easily read the examples given throughout this work there are some orthographic
conventions that should be understood.2
    (i) The homorganic nasal-stop cluster IncV is written rnd.
    (ii) The homorganic nasal—stop cluster /Itj/ is written nj. As far as I can tell, the sequence
         /nj/ does not occur (but see footnote 31 for a possible exception).","[32, 33, 34, 35]"
"
3     In this respect I disagree with Blake (1990), who argues that the West Barkly languages can be reanalysed
      as prefixing on the basis of the fact that bound pronouns are prefixed in the auxiliary to what he calls a
      verbal stem (p.54). This analysis is based on examples from Chadwick (1979:681) such as the following
      from Wambaya (I have retained Blake's glosses):
         (a)   Nguba.
               I:go:FUT
               I shall go.
         (b)   Ngajbi nguba
               see        I:go:FUT
              I'll go and see.
      Blake (p.54) claims that (a) contains a verb prefixed with a bound pronoun which in (b) functions as a
      grammatical verb governing a non-finite lexical verb. According to my corpus the form in (a) is not a
      verb but the auxiliary, and can be a complete utterance only in a context where it is clearly understood
      which verb has been ellipsed. Thus, the more correk;t version of (a) would be yarru nguba in which the
      auxiliary occurs with the verb yarru meaning 'go'. The form nguba is made up of the bound pronoun
      ng(i)- representing first person singular subject, and the suffix -uba which indicates that the tense is non-
      past and the action/event involves movement in a direction away from the speaker (see below).
                                                                               The auxiliary   139  Appendix C gives the forms of the auxiliaries in the other Eastern Group languages (from
Chadwick 1978)_
5.1 BOUND PRONOUNS
   Every auxiliary (except for some directional imperative auxiliaries — see §5.3) must contain
a bound pronoun that registers the subject of the clause, and if there is a first or second
person object, then the auxiliary must also contain a bound pronoun registering the object of
the clause. (Third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary. This is discussed in more
detail in §5.2.1.) The presence of bound pronouns in the auxiliary means that it is possible,
and indeed usual, to omit the overt NP if all the necessary information is included in the
bound pronoun itself, or if it is evident from context or previous discourse.
   The bound pronoun system as a whole makes a three-way distinction between transitive
subject (A), intransitive subject (S) and transitive object (0) (Table 5.1), although it is only in.
the third person singular that all three core functions are formally distinguished; all other
bound pronouns have homophonous A and S forms. While the subject bound pronouns
register person and number, object bound pronouns register person only. When the object is
non-singular, the appropriate accusative free pronoun is used to indicate the number of the
object (see below).
                     TABLE 5.1: SUBJECT AND OBJECT BOUND PRONOUNS                                           A          S          O

   Note that a gender distinction is made only in the third person transitive subject forms.
This distinction is between masculine (M), which only refers to Class I nominals, and non-
masculine (NM), which refers to nominals belonging to the feminine gender, Class II, as well
as nominals belonging to the two inanimate genders, Classes III and IV:
   (5-9)   Darranggu-nu ngîyi-ng-a              irrijabî.
           stick.IV-LOC      3SG.NM.A-IO-NF scratch
           The stick scratched me.
   As mentioned above, object bound pronouns distinguish only person, not number, and are
based on the singular subject forms. When the object is singular it is enough to have just the
object bound pronoun in the auxiliary (example (5-10)). When the object is non-singular,
however, the object bound pronoun in the auxiliary must be accompanied by a noun phrase
containing the appropriate accusative free pronoun (5-11), (5-12):
140   Chapter 5
  (5-10)    Jiya-j-ba      ngu-ny-u        gijilulu.
            give-TH-FUT 1SG.A-2SG-FUT money.IV(ACC)
            I will give you (sing.) money.
  (5-11)    Jiya-j-ba      ngu-ny-u     gurla gijilulu.
            give-TH-FUT 1SG.A-20-FUT 2DU.ACC money.IV(ACC)

            hit        3SG.M.A-10-NF 1PL.EXC.ACC
            He hit us.
  When the object is third person non-singular it is not represented in the auxiliary (see
§5.2.1), and must be expressed by a either an accusative free pronoun (example (5-13)), a
noun-headed NP (5-14), or both (5-15), (5-16):
  (5-13)    Ngajbî ng-a        wurla.
            see      1SG.A-PST 3DU.ACC
            I saw them (two).

            old.man-PL.I(ACC) 3SG.M.A-NP.AWY 3PL.ACC take
            He takes all the old men.
   Note that the object free pronoun does not have to follow the auxiliary immediately; see
example (5-15) and the following:
  (5-17)    Guyala ngurr-uji         ngajbi        irra.
            NEG     1PL.INC.A-NACT.PR see          3PL.ACC
            We've never seen them.
   As indicated in Table 5.1, third person objects are not registered in the auxiliary. While a
more typical analysis of the data would be to analyse the third person object morpheme to be
zero, a common situation in both Australian languages and other languages of the world, the
behaviour of auxiliaries of clauses with third person objects with respect to tense marking
indicates that they are best analysed as containing no object bound pronoun at all. The
arguments for this are given in Nordlinger (1993b) and in the discussion of tense marking in
§5.2.1.
   There are a few examples in which a plural bound pronoun is used with dual reference,
with no obvious difference in meaning. The following extract is taken from Text 1 (Appendix
A), in which other examples can also be found (e.g. lines 7-10, 14 and so on). The subject of
this extract is two boys and it begins with one of them talking to the other:
   (5-18)   ""Ngajbî   ngurr-uba        yang           ngangaba najbî

             ""Let's go and look at the fire that's burning.""
             Yarru irr-        ngaj-bi nanawulu        ilarra-wulu
             go    3PL.S-PST see        this.II.DU.ACC eaglehawk-DU(ACC)

             middle-LOC 3DU.S(NP)-PROG sit
             (who) were sitting in the middle (of their camp).
   There are also examples in which a singular bound pronoun is used with general plural
reference:
  (5-19)     Bungmanyî-ni gun-u             nij-ba, nayida    g-u       gajurra.
             old.man.I-LOC 3SG.M.A-FUT sing-FUT woman.II(NOM) 3SG.S-FUT dance.FuT
             The men will sing (while) the women dance.
  However, in other examples the third person plural form irri is used with non-specific or
general reference, as is `one' or `they' in English:
  (5-20)     Ngarringga irr-a          narunguja.
             take.from 3PL.A-PST car.IV(ACC)
             They've taken (her) car. (when explaining that my car had been sent on a truck
             to Adelaide)
5.1.1 THE REFLEXIVE/RECIPROCAL PRONOUN
  In reflexive and reciprocal constructions, the reflexive/reciprocal bound pronoun (glossed
'RR') occurs in the object position in the auxiliary. The form of this bound pronoun is -ngg 4
and it is followed by regular tense/aspect/mood suffixes (see §5.2.1). Some examples are:
  (5-21)     Gurda ngiyi-ngg-a.
             be.sick 3SG.NM.A-RR-NF
             She is sick.
   (5-22)    Daguma j-ba irri-ngg-i.
             hit-TH-FUT       3PL.A-RR-FUT
             They all will fight.
   (5-23)    Daguma-j-ba wurlu-ngg-u.
             hit-TH-FUT 3DU.A-RR-FUT
             They two will fight.
  Note that, although the transitive forms of the subject bound pronouns are used in these
constructions, a subject NP takes nominative case marking, rather than ergative/locative case
marking (as would usually be expected of a transitive subject; see §4.4.3). Thus, the    Note that the Gudanji form of this pronoun is -ngga as in:
       Ngajbi wurlu-ngga-ma.
       See      3DU.A-RR-PST
       They saw each other.
    This is presumably the underlying form of the Wambaya suffix also; the tense suffix replacing the final
    vowel.
142   Chapter 5reflexive/reciprocal marker appears to detransitivise a transitive verb, as evidenced by the
subject's change in case marking.
  (5-24)    Janji       gini-ngg-a      wagardbi.
            dog.I(NOM) 3SG.M.A-RR-NF wash
            The dog is washing himself.
   (5-25)   Alag-bulu       wurlu-ngg-a nyurrunyurru.
            child-DU(NOM) 3DU.A-RR-NF chase
            The two children are chasing each other.
   This is the only situation in which there is a mismatch between transitive subject bound
pronouns and ergative/locative case marking. In all other types of constructions, a NP
represented by a transitive subject bound pronoun must have ergative/locative case marking.
   While indirect objects of verbs such as ayanî `look (for)' and yandu `wait (for)' are not
cross-referenced in the auxiliary with ordinary object bound pronouns (see example (5-3)
above), they can be cross-referenced by the reflexive/reciprocal pronoun.
   (5-26)   Ayani ngurlu-ngg-a.
            look.for IDU.EXC.A-RR-NF
            We're looking for each other.
   (5-27)   *Ayani ngî-ny-a.
              look.for 1SG.A-20-NF
            I'm looking for you.
   (5-28)   Ayani ngi            nganga.
            look.for 1 SG.S(PR) 2SG.OBL
            I'm looking for you.
   This is, therefore, one way in which indirect objects (marked with dative case) can be
distinguished from dative adjuncts: the latter cannot be cross-referenced by the
reflexive/reciprocal pronoun:
   (5-29)   *Wugbardi ngurlu-ngg-u            gunju.
             cook       1DU.EXC.A-RR-FUT meat.IV(ACC)
            We will cook meat for each other.
   (5-30)   Wugbardi ng-u            gunju     alangî-nka.
            cook        1SG.A-FUT meat.IV(ACC) boy.I-DAT
            I will cook meat for the boy.","[156, 157, 158, 159, 160]"

7.5 QUESTIONS
7.5.1 YES/NO QUESTIONS
   Yes/no questions usually have the same form as the corresponding declarative sentence,
but are said with a rising, questioning intonation:
  (7-137) Gajbi murnd-u          yana         manganyma?
          eat   IDU.INC.A-FUT this.IV.SG.ACC tucker.Ili(ACC)
          Can we eat some of this food?
   (7-138) Yagu ny-a         nagatna            ngayijinya ngangirna?
           leave 2SG.A-PST that.one.1I.SG.ACC FM.II(ACC) 2SG.POSS.II(ACC)
           Did you drop your grandmother off (at the hospital)?
   (7-139) Yana                ngarrga?
             this.IV.SG:NOM ISG.POSS.IV(NOM)
             Is this mine?
  Hale's corpus contains examples in which an interrogative particle gayi is used in such
polar yes/no questions. Note that this particle appears in the auxiliary in examples (7-140)
and (7-141), and alone in second position in the verbless clause (7-142):18
   (7-140) Duditiarri gayi-ny-u     iniyawulu?
           spear      INT-2SG.A-FUT that.I.DU.ACC
             What, you are spearing them (du)? (Hale 1959:13)
18 In the following examples I have used the orthography and glossing conventions of this work, hut have
     retained Hale's translations.
198     Chapter 7   (7-141) Balijî  gayi-nyi?
           hungry INT-2SG.S(PR)
           Are you hungry? (Hale 1959:19)
   (7-142) Gudayi-barli                gayi inîya                 janji?
              bite-AGNT.I(NOM) INT that.I.SG.NOM dog.I(NOM)
              Is that dog cheeky? (Hale 1959:29)
   This interrogative particle is not present in my corpus and, since the dialect that Hale
recorded appears to be closer to Gudanji than Wambaya,19 it is possible that the interrogative
particle gayi is present only in Gudanji. However, there is a negative interrogative particle in '
Wambaya present in both my corpus and Hale's notes, and also reported by Chadwick
(1978:99). The form of this particle is wayi and, like the negative particle guyala, it requires
the presence of irrealis marking in the auxiliary. There is some variability as to how sentences
containing this particle are translated into English: either as negative yes/no questions
(examples (7-143), (7-144)); information questions meaning `why not' (7-143); or as simple
positive yes/no questions ((7-145), (7-146)):
   (7-143) Wayî           ny-uda                îlînga?
              NEG.INT 2SG.A-NACT.PST hear
              Aren't you listening?/Why aren't you listening?
   (7-144) Wayi           ny-uda                yabu balanucrru?
              NEG.INT 2SG.A-NACT.PST have                 spear.IV(ACC)
              Don't you have a spear? (Hale 1959:31)
   (7-145) Wayî           ny-udi              ngarlwî Wambaya?
              NEG.INT 2SG.S-NACT.PR talk
              Can you talk Wambaya? (Hale 1959:31)
   (7-146) (W)ayî ny-udî               yabu guyiga?
              NEG.INT 2SG.A-NACT.PR    have fire.IV(ACC)
              Have you got firewood? (Chadwick 1978:99)
   I suspect that the basic use of wayî is in yes/no questions when the speaker is anticipating
a negative reply, and that examples such as (7-145) and (7-146) could probably have been
explained in this way in the contexts in which they were given. The information question
associated with (7-143) could arise for pragmatic reasons: if the speaker asks the question
Aren't you listening? then it might be expected that he/she is also looking for an explanation
why. However, further research is required in order to test this hypothesis and more
accurately determine the meaning of this particle and the contexts of its use.","[215, 216]"

table. This cluster is found in only one word and is highly unusual, not only in its
combination of consonants, but also in the fact that the cluster occurs initially in the syllable:
jrayijala `gooramurra' The phonotactic aberrance of this word suggests that it may have been
borrowed. This hypothesis is supported by the existence of the synonym marndardbarla,
which conforms with Wambaya's phonotactic constraints and may be the native Wambaya
word.

   As Table 2.3 above clearly demonstrates, consonant clusters in Wambaya are constrained
in a fairly systematic way. Except for the homorganic nasal—stop clusters, all of the
consonant clusters in Table 2.3 fall within a certain area of the chart: on the left hand side,
and particularly in the lower left-hand corner. It is exactly this sort of pattern that is predicted
by Hamilton's (1995) continuum (LABIAL DORSAL LAMINAL APICAL). According to this
continuum, labials followed by dorsals are the preferred onsets and apicals (followed by
laminais) are the preferred codas. The lower left hand corner of Table 2.3, where most of the
Wambaya consonant clusters fall, is that part of the table where apical codas (the first element
of the cluster) are coupled with labial and dorsal onsets (the second element of the cluster).
Furthermore, labial codas and apical onsets (both of which are least preferred according to the
continuum) occur only in homorganic nasal—stop clusters (which are excluded from
discussion by Hamilton).
   A second claim made by Hamilton, specifically directed at cluster phonotactics, is also
supported by the Wambaya data. According to Hamilton, the first consonant in a consonant
cluster must have a value further to the right on the continuum than the second consonant in.
order for the cluster to be licit.20 Thus, a cluster consisting of a dorsal followed by a labial is
well-formed (e.g. /gb/) while one consisting of a labial followed by a dorsal is not (e.g.
*/bg/)
   The consonant clusters in Wambaya conform exactly with this constraint: labials never
occur as the initial consonant in a cluster (as they are the leftmost member of the continuum),
dorsals are followed only by labials, laminais are followed by dorsals and labials, and apicals
are followed by all three (although there is only one instance of an apical followed by a
laminal: /mj/).
  Cross-cutting these cluster constraints based on active articulators are constraints based on
sonority values. Consonant clusters in Wambaya are well-formed only if the second20 Again, this is excluding homorganic nasal—stop clusters.
32    Chapter 2
consonant has a value that is lower than or equal to that of the first on the sonority hierarchy:
OBSTRUENT<NASAL<LIQUID<GLIDE.21 This explains, for example, why it is that nasal—stop
clusters are possible, but stop-nasal clusters are not. There are three exceptions to this
principle, all of which contain a liquid followed by a glide (glides are higher on the sonority
hierarchy than liquids). Thus /rrw/, /lw/, /rlw/ all contravene the above-mentioned principle
of relative sonority for consonant clusters.
   The principles governing well-formed consonant clusters in Wambaya can be formulated
as follows ((i)-(iv) are taken from the above discussion, (v)-(vii) are additional constraints
evident in Table 2.3):
  (i) All homorganic nasal—stop clusters are well-formed.
 (ii) The first member of a consonant cluster (excluding those in (i)) must be higher than the
      second member of the cluster on the following hierarchy (from Hamilton 1995):
      LABIAL<DORSAL<LAMINAL<APICAL (iii) Despite the possibilities predicted by (ii), a laminal can occur only as the second
       element of a cluster (excluding those in (i)) if it is preceded by a retroflex stop or nasal.
 (iv) The first member of a consonant cluster must have a value higher than or equal to the
      second member on the following sonority hierarchy (from Clements 1990):
      OB STRUENT<NASAL<LIQUID<GLIDE
 (v) As an exception to (iv), clusters containing a liquid followed by the glide /w/ are well-
     formed.
 (vi) A lateral can be the initial member in a consonant cluster only if it is followed by a
      peripheral stop or the glide /w/.
(vii) Neither /ly/, /y/ nor In can occur in a consonant cluster.
  These seven principles account for the well-formedness of all of the clusters contained in
Table 2.3 as well as the ill-formedness of those corresponding to empty cells. The only
exceptions to this are the cells containing question marks which possibly reflect accidental
gaps in the corpus.
   This discussion of consonant clusters has so far centred only on clusters containing two
consonants. However, there is one tri-consonantal cluster (/rrgb/) found in Wambaya. This
cluster is found only in a small number of Wambaya words (in a sample of over 1200 words
only 5 contain this tri-consonantal cluster intramorphemically). Examples of this cluster are:
      bunjurrgbarra      bend down (towards)
      burrgbanju         blow (on)
      lurrgbanyî         grab, abduct
      milîrrgbarna       blue tongue lizard
      gurrgbarra         stare
21 As given in Clements (1990). Note that the Wambaya pattern conforms with the Syllable Contact Law
    (Murray and Vennemann 1983) stated in Clements (1990:287) as follows:
    In any sequence Ca $ Cb there is a preference for Ca to exceed Cb in sonority.
                                                                            Phonetics and phonology       332.2.3.2 INTERMORPHEMIC CLUSTERS
   There are significantly fewer consonant clusters that are found across morpheme
boundaries in Wambaya than are found within morphemes, and there are none that are found
only intermorphemically. There are some very simple reasons for this. Firstly, the
phonotactic constraint that all words must end in a vowel means that a lot of stems are vowel-
final.
      gijilulu . money         gijilulu-ngunya       money-PROP (II)
      jantba ground            jamba-nmanji          ground.Iv-ALL
   Secondly, although there are some consonant-final nominal and verbal roots which
function as stems for the addition of suffixes, in most examples in the corpus the final
consonant of the stem is either /j/, /g/, /ny/, /n/, /rd/, /ng/ or Id/ and the initial consonant of the
suffix is /b/ (or /w/ after liquids); all of the clusters are also found morpheme-internally:
      bungmaj- old man             bungmaj-bulu       old man-DU
      gulug-   sleep               gulug-baji         sleep-PRIV (I)
      jany-     dog                jany-bulu          dog-DU
      garran-  stand               garran-barda       stand-INF

      ngarl-    talk               ngarl-waji         talk-PRN (I)
   And finally, Wambaya employs a number of devices to reduce or alter illicit consonant
clusters (i.e. those that do not conform to the well-formedness principles listed in §2.2.3.1)
that arise across morpheme boundaries; see §2.3.5.22
2.2.4 STRESS PLACEMENT
   The stress placement rules for Wambaya are similar to those for Warlpiri as reported in
Nash (1986). Stress placement in Wambaya is sensitive to morphological structure; each
polysyllabic morpheme constitutes a new domain for the placement of stress. Generally stress
falls on the first syllable of the stress domain and on each following alternate syllable, except
that the final syllable usually does not carry any stress. Stress placement is also sensitive to
syllable weight as heavy syllables (i.e. those containing a phonemic long vowel) are always
stressed whether they are in the first or second syllable of the stress domain (the only two
positional possibilities for long vowels). Therefore, with the exception of a handful of words
with a phonemic long vowel in their second syllable, primary stress falls on the first syllable
of the word.23
   Usually there is a one-to-one correspondence between a stress domain and a morpheme.
This is not the case for monosyllabic suffixes, however, which cannot constitute a stress
domain on their own. Monosyllabic suffixes either combine with a following monosyllabic
suffix to form a disyllabic stress domain or, if there is no following monosyllabic suffix, join
the stress domain of the root. (This is discussed in more detail below.) Monosyllabic roots,22   Note that the limited number of intermorphemic clusters is attributable to factors other than specific
     constraints on these clusters; it is possible that more research, and a larger corpus, would reveal other
     intermorphemic clusters.
23 In this respect I disagree with Chadwick (e.g. 1978:17) who claims that primary stress in all of the West
    Barkly languages falls on the penultimate syllable of the word.
34     Chapter 2
however, constitute a stress domain of their own. The auxiliary, although made up of more
than one morpheme (see Chapter 5), is only a stress domain of its own if it is polysyllabic.
When it is monosyllabic it must attach to the word to its left for the purposes of stress
placement:
       'bung.ma.nya ga > 'bung.ma. + ,nya. = ga old woman + II = 3SG.S.PST
  The examples in Table 2.4 demonstrate the interaction between stress placement and
morphological structure.

        'j any.-         dog (ROOT) > 'jany. + ,bu.lu           dog + DU
   From a formal perspective, the stress placement rules in Wambaya can be described with
reference to foot structure and principles of metrical phonology.25 I will assume Nespor and
Vogel's (1986) definition of `the foot' (a higher level grouping of syllables below the
phonological word), which considers the foot to exist independently of stress placement, and
the construction of feet to precede rules of stress placement.
   The rules for constructing feet in Wambaya are given below, followed by some
explanation and exemplification of their use. These rules account for all the characteristics of
Wambaya stress placement mentioned above. As will be clear in the following foot-building
rules, feet in Wambaya are left-headed and are sensitive to morphological structure.26
     Wambaya rules of foot-formation:
(i)a. Moving from left to right, assign obligatory branching, left-headed binary feet to each
      morpheme. If a heavy syllable (i.e. one containing a phonemic long vowel) is
      morpheme-final, making a binary foot impossible, assign a strong degenerate foot.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52]"

3.1.1.3 AUXILIARY
   The auxiliary is a fundamental constituent of Wambaya grammar. Its presence is
obligatory in every main verbal clause9 and most finite subordinate clauses. The auxiliary
contains most of the important grammatical information for the clause. It contains bound
pronouns which represent the core arguments of the clause and affixes which indicate tense,
aspect and mood. Although limited tense information is marked on the verb, that contained in
the auxiliary is usually more detailed and informative. Furthermore, there is some information
(such as habitual aspect and hypothetical mood) which is only ever marked on the auxiliary,
never on the verb. The auxiliary can also contain directional suffixes which indicate whether
the action described by the verb occurs in a direction away from or towards the speaker. The
auxiliary almost always occurs in second position in the clause. A detailed discussion of the
auxiliary and its component parts is found in Chapter 5.
   Phonologically, the auxiliary has some unusual characteristics. It is the only grammatical
word in Wambaya which can be monosyllabic, and the only word which can have a final
consonant. For the purposes of stress, a polysyllabic auxiliary constitutes a separate stress
domain, while a monosyllabic auxiliary cliticises to the preceding word and does not bear
stress (see §2.2.4).",[70]

   Spencer and Gillen also give subsection terms for Wambaya, as does Mathews (1905).
What is interesting about these terms is that modern -ma-final terms (such as Niyinama)
correspond in both cases to -m-final terms. Modem Wambaya has a phonotactic constraint
that all words must have a final vowel; perhaps the terms given by Spencer and Gillen and
Mathews reflect a stage of Wambaya when this constraint did not exist. Table 1.6 lists the
Spencer and Gillen terms, the Mathews terms and the corresponding modem terms from
Table 1.3 (in italics).

   Another interesting feature in Spencer and Gillen's list is that they have divided the
subsections into two moieties. This division is shown by the space halfway down the list in
Table 1.6. Spencer and Gillen name the first moiety Illitji and the second Liaritji . I have
never heard either of these terms, nor been told anything of moieties within the Wambaya
subsection. Avery (1990:41) discusses the existence of moieties and semimoieties in many
surrounding communities but says that they do not appear to exist in the Wambaya, Gudanji
and Ngarnga subsection systems. Perhaps the knowledge of these moieties has been lost
since the time of Spencer and Gillen's research.","[30, 31, 32]"

17 I have no examples of these predicates in non-finite subordinate clauses, and so do not know whether the
     modifying verb would remain in the non-future form there as well.
     It is also possible that ganjimi `all' and gurinymi `well, properly' are simply separate lexemes, although
      homophonous with and derived from the verbs ganjimi `finish' and gurinymi `make good' respectively.
      Under this analysis, constructions as in (7-116) and (7-117) above are not complex predicates but simply
      contain a verb and a modifying adverb.
                                                                 Syntax of simple sentences   195   (7-121) Durra          gî-n,             ngirra îrr-agba jananmi narunguja.

    These examples appear to have the intonational contour of single clauses and thus, are not
analysable as coordinate clauses along the lines of those discussed in §8.2.2. However, at
this stage of the investigation, such a distinction is based on purely impressionistic grounds
and needs to be confirmed by structural and semantic evidence that these examples contain a
single clause while those in §8.2.2 do not. For example, future tense examples are needed in
order to find out which verb (if not both) is inflected with the verbal future tense suffix. If
only one verb can be inflected, this would be strong evidence that the two belong to a single
clause; conversely if both verbs are inflected, this may suggest that they are in separate
clauses. Further research is also needed into the semantics of these constructions. For
example, if it is discovered that there a re semantic restrictions on the verbs which can appear
in these constructions, this may be evidence that there is only one clause involved, since we
would be less likely to expect co-occurrence restrictions to exist across clause boundaries.
Furthermore, if these constructions do involve only a single clause, it remains to be
determined what the semantic difference is between these clauses and coordinate clauses,
such as the following.

2.3 MORPHOPHONEMICS
2.3.1 LENITION
   The initial /b/ of a suffix will always lenite to /w/ when it is added to a vowel-final stem, or
to a stem ending in /rll or /rr/. Compare:
        ngaj-barlî          see-AGNT (I) BUT yugu-warli      cry-AGNT (I)
        gulug-ba            sleep-FUT    BUT ngarl-wa        talk-FUT
        jany-baji           dog-PRIV (I) BUT darranggu-waji stick-PRIV (I)
        bungmaj-bulu        old.man-DU BUT lagija-wulu       coolaman-DU
        and-bi              call.out-NF BUT ngirr-wi                    growl-NF28
   In fast or casual speech this lenition can also occur within morphemes, particularly if the
bilabial stop follows /g/, or if it is in a reduplicated syllable:
        -agba           HYP            -agwa
        wugbardi        cook         — wugwardî
        bardibardî      poor bugger — bardiwardi
   There are also a couple of examples in which /j/ lenites to /y/. This occurs in reduplications
(see §2.3.6 for a discussion of reduplication):
        junmi cut >           junmi-yunmi RDP-cut
and with the causitive suffix -jirrimi after a vowel-final stem:
        gannga+jirrimi        return+CAUS >          gannga-yirrimi
     See §6.2.1.1 for a discussion of this suffix.
     The retroflex stop /rd/ (written d word-initially) lenites to In in reduplication:
        daguma       hit > dagu-raguma            RDP-hit
This lenition is optional before /g/ intramorphemically:
        bardgu fall ~ bargu
28 It seems likely that this lenition would also occur after other liquids, given that it occurs after /rl/ and
       Irr/; however, there are no relevant examples in the corpus.
                                                                   Phonetics and phonology    392.3.2 ELISION
   When two identical vowels a re separated by a semivowel, the semivowel may be elided,
resulting in a phonetic long vowel (this process is discussed in more detail in §2.1.4 above).
This can occur both within and across morpheme boundaries.

     ngara-waji     drink-PRIV (I) > /ngara-aji/               Nap ,aiji]
     baraj-bulu     old.person-DU > /baaj-bulu/                ['baaii,bulu]
2.3.3 EPENTHESIS
   Epenthesis is one the strategies used when the concatenation of two different morphemes
results in an illicit consonan t cluster (see §2.3.5 for a full discussion). Thus, as /ni cannot
occur as the second member in a conson an t cluster (see §2.2.3 for a discussion of
permissible consonant clusters), an epenthetic vowel /ii is inserted between a consonant-final
stem and any suffix beginning with /n/. The examples in the corpus all involve verbs and the
suffixes -nka 'DAT', -nî `LOC' and -nnga `ABL' (see §6.1 for a discussion of verbal
morphology).
      mawula-j- + -nka       > mawula-j-i-nka         play-TH-EP-DAT
      gulug- + -nka          > gulug-i-nka            sleep-EP-DAT
      ngirra-j- + -nî        > ngirra j-i-ni          steal-TH-EP-LOC
      ngarl- + -ni           > ngarl-i-ni             talk-EP-LOC
      alalangmî j- + nnga    > alalangmi-j-i-nnga     hunt-TH-EP-ABL
    In examples in this work I will generally not segment this epenthetic vowel, but will group
it with the preceding morpheme (e.g. mawula-jî-nka, gulugî-nka).
   There is one example in the corpus in which lui is the epenthetic vowel. This example
involves the addition of the allative suffix -nmanji to a placename Junggurragurr `Tennant
Creek'. This placename has been borrowed from Warumungu and does not fit Wambaya
phonotactic constraints (by ending in a consonant), hence the need for an epenthetic vowel.
      Junggurragurr+ -nmanji > Junggurragurr-u-nmanji              Tennant.Creek-EP-ALL
2.3.4 ASSIMILATION
2.3.4.1 /w/ > /y/
   An intervocalic /w/ will assimilate to /y/ if it follows the high front vowel Iii. This process
affects the dual suffix -bulu/wulu and the privative suffix -baji/waji.
      /juguli-wulu/ > /juguliyulu/ rjuguli-, julu] boomerang-DU
      fuguli-waji/ > /juguliyaji/ r juguli-, jaijil boomerang-PRiv (I)
   This means that a morpheme which has an initial /b/ underlyingly can be realised with a /y/
(I will use orthography here for clarity):
      juguli + bulu > jugulî-wulu > juguli-yulu
   Thus, an initial /b/ lenites to /w/ intervocalically (see §2.3.1), and then the /w/ assimilates
to the 'frontness' and height of the preceding /i/, becoming /y/.
40     Chapter 22.3.4.2 OF STOPS BEFORE Im/
   When a root having a final stop is followed by a suffix beginning with the bilabial /m/, the
stop assimilates to a nasal. The examples of this involve the Class III gender suffix -ma and
the factitive suffix -mi:
       garnguj-     many        + -ma Class III > garngunyma many.III
       burnarîg-    wild.orange + -ma Class III > burnarîngma wild.orange.11l
       gurij-       good        + -mi FAC       > gurinymi    good.FAC
2.3.4.3 VOWEL HARMONY
   Unlike Jingili, Wambaya does not have many instances of vowel harmony. While the
process of vowel harmony in Jingili affects many nouns and most verbs (Chadwick
1975:10), systematic vowel harmony in Wambaya is only really found within the auxiliary,
although there are a couple of marginal instances restricted to specific morphemes.
  The ergative/locative suffix, usually -ni, has an allomorph -nu when the stem has final /u/.
The use of this allomorph is not obligatory; the two allomorphs are in free variation in this
environment. Some examples are:
     (2-9)   Mîrra ngurru               manjungu-nu/manjungu-ni.
             sit 1PL.INC.S(NP)          shade.IV-LOC
             We'll sit in the shade.
     (2-10) Daguma rig-a             darranggu-nu/darranggu-ni.
            hit        1SG.A-PST stick.IV-LOC
            I hit him/her/it with a stick.
The other morpheme which is affected by processes of vowel harmony is the suffix -barli
`AGNT'. The final vowel of this suffix can optionally be assimilated to /a/ with the addition of
the feminine suffix -rna .
        Daguma j-barlirna/daguma j-barlarna           hit-TH-AGNT.II     A discussion of this suffix is provided in §4.5.2.1.
   The vowel harmony in the auxiliary is triggered usually by the high vowels /u/ and /i/ and
affects any preceding high vowels. (There are no examples with preceding /a/ that would
allow us to determine whether it would also be affected by vowel harmony.)
   There are two types of vowel harmony in the Wambaya auxiliary: regressive and
progressive. Regressive vowel harmony involves the singular and the first person dual
inclusive subject bound pronouns (this set of pronouns will be termed `minimal'; see
§5.1.2). The underlying forms of these bound pronouns are as follows:29
        ngi     ISG.S/A
        nyi     2SG.S/A
        gi      3SG.S
        ginî    3SG.M.A
        ngîyi   3SG.NM.A
        mirndi 1DU.INC.S/A29 See Chapter 5 for a full discussion of the auxiliary, the bound pronouns and related affixes.
                                                                       Phonetics and phonology   41   The past tense suffix -a replaces the final vowel of the stem, but does not affect the
preceding Iii of the disyllabic stems:
      gin-a   3SG.M.A-PST
      ngîy-a  3SG.NM.A-PST
      mirnd-a I DU.INC.S/A-PST
  Nor does it affect the vowel(s) of the subject bound pronoun when it is added to an
auxiliary containing an object bound pronoun (in this case the suffix marks non-future tense):
      ngi-ny-a I SGA-20-NF
      nyi-ng-a 2SG.A-IO-NF
      gini-ng-a 3SG.M.A-10-NF
      ngiyi-ny-a 3SG.NM.A-20-NF
   However, when the future tense suffix -u is added any preceding vowels within the
auxiliary assimilate to the back vowel:
      ngu-ny-u   ISG.A-20-FUT
      nyu-ng-u   2SG.A-10-FUT
      gunu-ngg-u 3SG.M.A-RR-FUT
      nguyu-ny-u 3SG.NM.A-20-FUT
      murnd-u .  1DU:INC.S/A-FUT
   Any suffix with initial /u/ will also trigger this vowel harmony:
      ngu-ny-uda 1SG.A-20-NACT.PST
      murnd-uba I DU.INC.S/A-NP.AWY
   The habitual non-past suffix -ala provides the only example of /a/ triggering vowel
harmony:
     nga-ngg-ala     I SG.A-RR-HAB.NP
     gana-ng-ala     3SG.M.A-10-HAB.NP
     ngay-ala        3SG.NM.A-HAB.NP
   In the above examples a lu/ in a tense/aspect/mood/directional suffix triggers regressive
vowel harmony affecting the subject (and object) bound pronouns that precede it. However,
the situation concerning the non-minimal subject bound pronouns (i.e. all other non-singular
subject bound pronouns, see §5.1.2) is exactly the opposite. In the case of these bound
pronouns, it is the high vowel of the subject bound pronoun that triggers progressive vowel
harmony, affecting any high vowels in the following tense/aspect/mood/directional suffixes.
  Each of the non-minimal forms is disyllabic and has the same vowel in each syllable. The
underlying forms of the non-minimal subject bound pronouns are as follows:
     ngurlu I DU.EXC.S/A
     ngurru 1 PL.INC.S/A
     ngirri 1PL.EXC.S/A
     gurlu 2DU.S/A
     girri   2PL.S/A
     wurlu 3DU.S/A
     îrri    3PL.S/A
42    Chapter 2   Consider the following examples, in which suffixes that were triggering regressive vowel
harmony in the discussion of the minimal subject pronouns above are themselves affected by
progressive vowel harmony triggered by the vowel(s) in the non-minimal subject bound
pronoun.
    ngurlu-ny-u IDU.EXC.A-20-FUT
BUT ngirri-ny-i   1PL.EXC.A-20-FUT
    gurl-uba            2DU.S/A-NP.AWY

    wurlu-ngg-u 3DU.A-RR-FUT
BUT girri-ngg-i 2PL.A-RR-FUT
   The habitual non-past suffix also does not trigger vowel harmony with these subjects,
although it is not affected by vowel harmony itself:
      îrr-ala      3PL.S/A-HAB.NP
      girri-ng-ala 2PL.A-1 O-HAB.NP
2.3.5 REDUCTION OF NON-PERMISSIBLE CLUSTERS
    There are three different strategies employed in Wambaya to deal with the situation in
which a morphological process creates a non-permissible consonant cluster. (i) epenthesis,
(ii) assimilation of the first consonant to the other, (iii) deletion of the final consonant of the
stem. Of these, the first two were discussed in §2.3.3 and §2.3.4.2 respectively. In this
section I discuss the cases in which the stem-final consonant is deleted.
   The deletion of the stem-final consonant is the usual strategy whenever the addition of a
suffix to a consonant-final stem results in an illicit consonant cluster.30 This is the case if the
two consonants are different:
      alag-    child      +              -ji      Class I > alaji                  boy.I
      alag-    child      +              -nga     Class II > alanga .              gir1.II
      bungmaj- old.person +              -nyi-    Class I > bungmanyi-             old.man.I
      murrgun- three      +              -ma      Class II > murrgurna             three.II
or if the two consonants are identical:
      bungmaj-      old.person +         -ji      Class I > bungmaji             old.man.I
      -gun y-       PL         +         -nya     Class II > -gunya              PL.II
   There are two examples in which a consonant-initial suffix is added to a stem with a final
consonant cluster, thereby creating a triconsonantal cluster. In both of these examples it
remains the final consonant of the stem — the middle consonant of the cluster — which is
deleted:
      wawunyg- sugarbag + -ji              Class I    > wawunji             sugarbag.i
      ginganj- drown + -bi                 Non-future > ginganbi            drown330 There are two exceptions to this: (i) when the suffix is one of -ni `LOC', -nka 'DAT' or -nnga `ABL' and
    the stem is a verb an epenthetic vowel /i/ is inserted (see §2.3.3); and (ii) when the suffix begins with
    /m/ a preceding stem-final stop assimilates to the corresponding nasal (see §2.3.4.2).
                                                                               Phonetics and phonology       432.3.6 REDUPLICATION
    Reduplication in Wambaya is found mainly with verbs, with which it is used to indicate
iterative or durative aspect, or the intensity of the state described by the verb (see §6.1.7). It
is also used with a few nouns, usually marking plurality (see §4.5.3). With neither of these
word classes, however, does reduplication seem to be a regular and productive process,
being relatively uncommon and found only with a limited number of forms. Although
Wambaya is a suffixing language, reduplication generally occurs to the left; that is, the
reduplicated element is attached as a prefix. There are two main patterns of reduplication in
Wambaya, found with both verbs and nouns. At this stage of the investigation, it is not clear
what determines which reduplication pattern a particular form will follow: there are no
obvious phonological or morphological properties which characterise the two classes of
roots. Clearly, more research is required.
   The most common reduplication pattern copies (to the left) the first two syllables of the
word (or the whole word if disyllabic). In the following examples, syllable boundaries are
indicated by a period.32
     ngaj.bi             see              > ngaj.bi-ngaj.bi                        look around
     la ja:rri           light fire       > la ja-la ja.rri                        light fire (DUR)
     ngun.ju.lu          carry            > ngun.ju-ngun.ju.lu                     carry (DUR)
     nya.gaj.bi          be tired         > nya.ga-nya.gaj.bi                      be very tired33
     lung.gany.mi        make cheeky      > lung.gu34-lung.gany.mi                 make very cheeky
     la.barn.ga          branch (of tree) > la.ba-rla.barn.ga                      branch (of tree)
   If the first and second syllables of the word are identical, then only one syllable is copied:
       nya.nya.yu move around > nya-nya.nya.yu move around repeatedly
       di.di.ja   carry       > dî-dî.dî.ja    carry (DUR)
   If the word has an initial stop, this will often lenite to a glide in reduplicated forms. Thus,
/rd/ (written d initially) lenites to Id, r/ lenites to /y/ and /b/ lenites to /w/. There are no
examples of lenition of the velar stop /g/.
       da.gu.ma hit                  >              da.gu.-ra.gu.ma          keep hitting
       du.rra   be   frightened (of) >              du.rra.-ru.rra           be very frightened
       jun.mi   cut                  >              jun.mi.-yun.mi           keep cutting
       bard.gu  fall                 >              bard.gu.-ward.gu         keep falling
   The second main reduplication pattern in Wambaya is slightly more interesting as the
reduplicated part at first appears to be infixed, and does not constitute a single prosodic unit,
31 It is interesting that it is the alveolar nasal, rather than the palatal nasal, which appears in this form.
    This suggests that it is the alveolar nasal that is present before the palatal stop in the root (usually only
    the palatal nasal occurs in this position).
32 The glosses for the reduplicated forms given here are those that the form had in the context in which it
    was given. It is possible that a form may also have other meanings in other contexts. For example,
    lajalajarri may be able to have both a durative meaning such as 'spend some time lighting a fire' and an
    iterative meaning such as 'light many fires'.
33 Note that in this example, as in the two following, it appears that the final consonant of the second
    syllable has not been copied in the reduplicand. However, since in all cases this would result in an illicit
    consonant cluster, meaning that this consonant would be deleted (see §2.3.5), it is not possible to tell
    whether it has simply been copied and then deleted, or not copied at all.
34 Note that this vowel seems to have assimilated to those on either side of it.
44      Chapter 2
consisting of the rhyme of the first syllable and the onset of the second. This type of
reduplication process has been noted in other Australian languages, such as Warumungu
(Simpson 1992), Mangarayi (Merlan 1982) and Jingili (Chadwick 1975). Some examples of
this type of reduplication are:
        banymi      pass by        > banymanymî         keep passing by
        angbardi    build          > angbangbardi       build repeatedly
        bundurrijbî get full       > bundundurrijbi     get very full
        bungmaji    old man        > bungtnungmajî      old men
   Following accounts by McCarthy and Prince (1986:47) for Mangarayi we can account for
this reduplication process in the following way.
     (i) The initial consonant of the base word is considered extramelodic (i.e. it is detached
         from the base but is still available for copying).
 (ii) Attach the template of one syllable as a prefix to the base.
 (iii) Given a copy of the base, satisfy the syllable to the fullest.
 (iv) According to the universal Onset Rule, copy the initial consonant of the second syllable
      of the base as the onset of the second syllable of the reduplicated form.
  Thus, if we apply this account to the Wambaya examples, the derivation of a form such as
banymanymi is as follows:
           6        a
        (b)any mi                        A
               (b)any mi
        banymî      (b)any mî
iv. a            + 6           a
        banymi (b)any mi
   In a form such as angbardi there is no initial consonant to be extramelodic, but the rest of
the derivation remains the same:
i.        a a       a        ang ba rdi
                                                                    Phonetics and phonology   45ii.      a+       a                 a
                  g       La rî                 ,‘ u
        angbardi wig ba rdi
iv.       a+          a
        angbardi ang ba rdi
      In one Wambaya form, the template appears to be two syllables, rather than one syllable:
        garriji   `be cold' >       gamjarriji
i.      a a a         \N N
        (g)a m fl
ii.     a a + a a a                               N.   N           if         (g)a      m jt
        gamji (g)a ni ji
iv. a a + a a a        1\4-'1 N N
     gamft (g)a m Jt
  Although these two reduplication patterns account for most of the reduplicated forms in
Wambaya, there are a few other forms which are reduplicated in slightly different ways. In a
couple of examples the reduplicated form is derived by copying the last two syllables of the
word to the right:
        ya.rru.bu.rdu        walk around > ya.rru.bu.rdu-bu.rdu   keep walking around
        garr.ga.lyi          plains lizard > garr.ga.lyî-ga.lyî   plains lizard
Some other reduplicated forms (of nouns) appear to be unpredictable:
        alaji    boy > alajaji          boys
        iligirra river > ililirri       rivers
                                              CHAPTER 3              PARTS OF SPEECH AND OTHER PRELIMINARIES3.1 PARTS OF SPEECH
   There are seven parts of speech (or `word classes') in Wambaya, determined by the
inflectional and distributional characteristics of each word. These classes are mutually
exclusive:1 each root belongs to only one word class, although with the use of derivational
suffixes, it is possible for a root to move its membership from one word class to another.
These derivational suffixes are discussed in §4.5.2 (verb to nominal) and §6.2.2 (nominal to
verb). The seven parts of speech in Wambaya are:
     (1)     NOMINALS
               (i) nouns
              (ii) adjectives
             (iii) free pronouns
             (iv) demonstratives
              (v) locational nominals
             (vi) temporal nominals
            (vii) indefinite/interrogatives
      (2)    VERBS
      (3)    AUXILIARY
      (4)    ADVERBS
      (5)    PARTICLES
      (6)    CLITICS
      (7)    INTERJECTIONS
   Of these seven word classes, the two largest and most important are the open classes of
verbs and nominals. These two classes have quite distinct morphological and syntactic
characteristics. Nominals generally inflect for gender, number and case and usually function
as the arguments of the clause.2 Verbs on the other hand are inflected for tense, co-occur with
the auxiliary and typically function as the predicate of the clause. Both classes also have
different derivational possibilities. Although word-class membership is determined primarily
on grammatical and functional grounds such as these, it is also possible to characterise the
difference between these two word classes on semantic grounds: verbs typically describe
states, actions and events, and nominals usually denote entities, objects and attributes.3
   In the following discussion I divide the word classes into `inflecting' (nominals, verbs and
the auxiliary) and `non-inflecting' (adverbs, particles, clitics and interjections).","[56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64]"
"
1   See below for two exceptions to this.
2   But see §7.1 for a discussion of clauses in which nominals function as predicates.
3   As word-class membership is not determined on semantic grounds, it is possible that either of these
    classes will contain members whose semantic characteristics do not comply with these generalisations.

                                                               Parts of speech and other preliminaries   473.1.1 INFLECTING WORD CLASSES
3.1.1.1 NOMINALS
(i) and (ii) Nouns and Adjectives
    For the most part, adjectives and nouns in Wambaya can be considered the same. In this
respect, Wambaya is typical of Australian languages, in which there is generally little formal
distinction between nouns and adjectives (Dixon 1980:272). Both nouns and adjectives are
inflected for case, number and gender, can function as the head of a noun phrase or as a
modifier qualifying the head; and can function as the predicate of a verbless clause (see §7.1).
   However, there are differences between nouns and adjectives that support the treatment of
them as two different subclasses even though they are both contained within the larger
superordinate class of nominals. These differences are semantic, morphological and
syntactic.
   Semantically, nouns typically denote objects and entities while adjectives typically denote
attributes. Furthermore, while nouns inherently belong to only one gender (or at most two, in
the case of some animate and plant nouns), an adjective has no inherent gender, but
potentially can be marked for any of the four genders in agreement with the noun that it
modifies (or in the case of an adjective functioning as the head of the phrase, in agreement
with the referent). For example:
      bugayî     alaji               big boy (I)
      bugayirna bayigina             big bag (II)
      buguwama jigama                big yam (III)
      buguwa     darranggu           big stick (IV)
   Morphologically, most of the inflectional suffixes are identical for both nouns and
adjectives. However there is at least one difference, again concerning gender: while Class IV
(the neuter gender) is generally not marked on nouns, it is marked on some adjectives by
either -a, -ga or -ja:4
Nouns:
    balamurru        spear (1V)
    wunba            wind (IV)
    barrawu          house (1v)
Adjectives:
     gurijb-a   good-Iv
     murrgun-ga three-IV
     bagi-ga    bad-Iv
     garngu-ja  many-IV
  Note that this is simply a difference in the form of the marking, not in the number of
gender possibilities for nouns and adjectives, which is exactly the same.
   The difference between the semantics of nouns and adjectives also leads to different
derivational possibilities. For example, the derivational suffix -mî, which can be attached to a
nominal X to derive a factitive verb with the meaning `cause to be X, make X' is found only
4   However with most adjectives, as with nouns, Class iv is not overtly marked (see §4.2.2).
48     Chapter 3
with adjectives, not with nouns. Thus, gurijbî `good' can become guriny-mi `make good,
make better', but a noun such as juwa `man' cannot become *juwamî `make into a man' .5
    Syntactically, while it is possible for nouns to function as modifiers of the head noun, as
in bungmaji barnanggi `old man barnanggi'6 and lagurra jurutna `deep/sunken stomach'
(literally `hole stomach'), this is relatively unusual and it is significantly more common for
adjectives to have this function.
   Thus, while there are many reasons for considering nouns and adjectives to be members
of the same superordinate word class of nominals, there is adequate justification for
considering them to be different subclasses of nominals, thereby allowing for them to behave
and be treated slightly differently with respect to certain features of the grammar.
   There is a slight structural difference for two adjectives, bagij(b)i `bad, no good (I)' and
gurijbi `good (I)', depending on whether they have a `subjective' (or experiential) meaning or
an `objective' (or evaluative) meaning. When the adjective occurs as the predicate in a
verbless construction (as in examples (3-1) and (3-3)) the meaning must be objective. If the
meaning is to be subjective, then the adjective must occur in a verbal construction, usually
with either the verb manku `hear, feel' (3-2) or the verb mirra `sit' (3-4).7

           I (female) feel good.
    However, it is possible for a verbal construction, with mirra, to have an objective reading
if, for example, the verbal construction is needed for the specification of non-present tense
(see §7.1.7): .

objective meaning.","[64, 65, 66]"

7.7.2.3 GAJI `LEST'
   Gajî is used to link two clauses with the meaning that the action described by the first
clause is carried out in order to prevent that of the second clause. This particle is found in the
speech of only one speaker (MH) and, since this speaker's dialect appears to consist primarily
33 . The use of ngaba: in this function may be an example of the pragmatic ambiguity of conjunctions
     discussed by Sweetser (1990:76ff). I am indebted to Nick Evans for this observation. Although Sweetser
     does not discuss 'so that, so then' conjunctions such as ngaba, the fact that she finds that other
     conjunctions function not only to link content items or logical premises. hut to link speech acts as well
     (as in 'Where were you last night(?), and don't give me any nonsense about staying late at the officer
     (p.112)), makes this polysemy of ngaba less surprising.
34 MH, whose dialect is closest to Gudanji, uses the particle gardaji in this construction, rather than ngaba.
210    Chapter7
of Gudanji, it is likely that gaji actually belongs to Gudanji rather than Wambaya. Examples
of this particle in the corpus include the following:
   (7-215) Corner-ni bangani ng-ala-n                     mirra gaji gini

           I'm going to go see what money they've got in case they're drunk (and therefore

    In the speech of the other speakers such admonitive meanings are expressed with two
separate finite clauses, with the `lest' clause marked by the presence of the hypothetical suffix
in the auxiliary. Thus:

4.9 NP STRUCTURE
   A Wambaya noun phrase consists of a head and one or more modifiers, all of which are
optional (the head can be ellipsed when it is recoverable from previous discourse; see below).
All members of the NP must agree in terms of gender, number and case (where
morphologically possible). As is common to several Australian languages, elements of NPs in
Wambaya need not be contiguous in the clause. This possibility of discontinuous NP
constituents has led researchers working on some Australian languages (e.g. Heath 1986 on
Nunggubuyu, Blake 1983 on Kalkatungu) to suggest that these languages may not have NP
                                                                                                Nominals      131constituents, and that apparent NPS can just be treated as apposed nominals. I will not review
the arguments for this analysis here, but assume that the following two pieces of evidence
argue for the existence of a NP constituent in Wambaya, at least in those cases in which the
elements are contiguous (see below for more discussion of discontinuous NPs):
     (i) Usually the auxiliary must follow the initial word of a clause. However, it is possible
         for the auxiliary to follow a complex NP, thereby providing evidence for its existence
         as a constituent_ The position of the auxiliary can then be described as being after the
         initial constituent of a clause.
     (ii) In possessive phrases in which the possessor is marked with either genitive or dative
          case, relational case marking is found only on the head of the NP. As relational case
          marking is not found on the possessor nominal in this situation, the case marking
          found on the head nominal also refers to the modifying nominal, thereby providing
          evidence that the two nominals in such phrases form a single NP constituent.
   The structure of a Wambaya NP is as follows.78 Note that any one of the modifers listed in
the position before the head can be postposed to follow the head.79
       (MODIFIERS)                       (HEAD) (MODIFIER)
       (Dem)(POSS)(Num)(Adj) Nom
       Dem = Demonstrative
       POSS = Possessive pronoun or demonstrative, or possessive NP
       Num = Numeral
       Adj = Adjective
       Nom = Nominal
  The head is usually filled by a noun, but can in principle be any type of nominal. An
example from Text 1 in Appendix A in which a numeral functions as the head is:
     (4-301) Garnguji=miji                in-i-n                mirra.
               many.I(NOM~INFER 3PL.S(NP)-PROG sit
               There must be a big group (of people).
   The fact that this example occurs at the beginning of the text (i.e. the second line) before
there has been any mention of people, suggests that the numeral is functioning as the head,
rather than simply modifying an ellipsed head. However, there are a small number of
examples in which it may be argued that the head has been ellipsed. Consider the following
sequence (lines 62-64) from the same text:S0
78    This is the same structure as in Kayardild (Evans 1995a) and is very similar to the Gooniyandi structure
      (McGregor 19%).
79    In his detailed discussion of Gooniyandi noun phrases, McGregor (1990) makes a distinction between
      reference modification and referent modification, and shows that this distinction correlates with a contrast
      in function between pre-head and post-head modifiers. Thus, an element which precedes the head modifies
      the reference of the head nominal, it selects a subset of the potential referents denoted by the nominal. In
      contrast. a post-head constituent modifies the head's referent, indicating a quality of property of the thing
      itself, which may be independent of the nominal denoting the entity (p. 26711). Further research is needed
      to determine whether there is likewise a semantic difference between pre- and post- head modifiers in
      Wambaya.
80    This discussion has benefited greatly from McGregor's (1990) discussion of NPs in Gooniyandi,
132   Chapter4   (4-302) Bungmaj-buli-ji     ngankawuliji wurl-aji               daguma juwarramba.

            many.i(ACC) 3DU.A-HAB.PST hit
            They'd been killing a lot of them.
  In this example, in contrast to that given in (4-301), garnguji in the final line appears to be
modifying the ellipsed head juwarramba which is mentioned in the preceding two clauses.
Thus, this is one example in which an NP has no overt constituent corresponding to its head.
   A NP can also be made up of a pronoun. A (non-possessive) pronoun is always the head
of a phrase, and usually occurs alone (although see below for some possible exceptions to
this).
   Some example NPs are:

   Although the tendency is for NPs to be contiguous, it is possible for members of a NP to be
separated in the clause. In the majority of these examples, one element of the discontinuous
NP appears initially in the clause (see examples (4-312)-(4-314)), but this is not always the
case (see (4-315)).
  Examples of discontinuous NPs are:
  (4-312) Garngunya gin-aji                yabu garirda-rdarra       garndawugini-ni.
          manylRACC) 3SG.M.A-HAB.PST have wife.Il-GROUP(ACC) one.i-LOC

           Sister you're making lots of dust for us.
   A great deal more work is needed on discontinuous constituents in Wambaya and the
discourse conditions under which they are possible.                    .
  A small set of nouns can also be used as modifiers, modifying a head noun. The most
common examples of this involve the noun bungmajî `old man' (1):
   (4-316) Garidi-ni      bungmanyi-ni gin-amany     yanybi.
           husband.I-LOC old.man.I-LOC 3SG.M.A-P.TWD get
           (Her) old man husband came and got (her).
   (4-317) Agarri           bungmaji          juga g-a        yarru
           ISG.POSS.I(NOM) old.man.I(NOM) MB.I(NOM) 3SG.S-PST go
           mawula-ji-nka.
           play-TH-DAT
           My old man uncle came to play (cards).
134     Chapter 4   Another example involves the noun lagurra `hole'. Note that despite the fact that it belongs
to a different gender, lagurra shows no gender agreement with the head noun in this example:
     (4-318) Yabu ng-aji             lagurra        juruma.
             have 1SG.A-HAB.PST hole.IV(ACC) stomach.IIl(ACC)
             I used to have a deep stomach (i.e. I was very thin).
   In a couple of examples an oblique pronoun co-occurs with a noun. In these examples it is
difficult to determine whether the two belong to one NP or to different NPs. However, the fact
that pronouns usually occur alone in a NP, and that there is usually (but not always) a pause
between the pronoun and the noun, suggests that it may be better to treat these examples as
containing two apposed NPs, as in the English translations.
     (4-319) Yandu irrî          ngaya     bulungunga-nka.
             wait   3PL.S(NP) 3SG.F.OBL young.woman.II-DAT
             They wait for her, the young woman.
     (4-320) Yangula g-a         yarru naniyaga          mujuju-ngunya
             NEG       3SG.S-PST go     that.II.SG.NOM menstruation-PROP.II(NOM)
             irrîga-yîli-nmanji juwa-nmanji.
             3PL.OBL-COMIT-ALL man.I-ALL
             That menstruating woman can't go near them, the men.
   However, in at least one example in the corpus, a pronoun appears between a modifier and
a noun, making the apposition analysis harder to justify:
     (4-321) Jawaranya          ng-u        yidanyî ngaba ng-u               yardi
             billycan.II(ACC) ISG.A-FUT get          THEN      1SG.A-FUT put
             yaniya           cool drink nînaka            nanga         juglni-nka.
             that.IV.SG.ACC cool drink this.I.SG.DAT 3SG.M.OBL boy.t-DAT
             I'm going to get the billycan and put that cold drink (in it) for this boy.
   Further investigation is required. In particular, it is necessary to test whether a pronoun +
noun combination can appear before the auxiliary before it can be determined whether they
can together make up a single NP.
INALIENABLE POSSESSION
   As mentioned in §4.8, Wambaya makes a formal distinction between two types of
possessive constructions: alienable and inalienable. In constructions of alienable possession
the possessor is expressed by either a possessive pronoun or demonstrative, or by a nominal
inflected with either the dative or genitive case. In constructions of inalienable possession,
however, there is no special marking on the possessor nominal and the two nominals occur in
juxtaposition. Examples of constructions of alienable possession are found in §4.8. §4.6.
§4.4.4 and §4.4.10. A discussion of inalienable possession follows.
   Constructions of inalienable possession are the most common type of what are commonly
referred to as part-whole constructions.81 These constructions are thus in contrast to those of
alienable possession, which encode two entities as being associated, but easily separable.","[148, 149, 150, 151, 152]"

7.2 VERBAL CLAUSES: BASIC ARGUMENT STRUCTURES
   In this section I discuss basic verbal clauses in terms of their main verb and the core
arguments that it subcategorises for: subject, (direct and second) object, indirect object and
subject complements. In §3.2 I outlined the criteria by which these different argument types
can be identified in Wambaya. Some aspects of this discussion, namely the distinctions
between the different types of objects,. are worth reviewing here.
  (i) Direct objects are distinguished from second objects and indirect objects as they are
      registered on the auxiliary with an object bound pronoun.
 (ii) Second objects are found with a very small set of ditransitive verbs which also take a
      direct object (see §7.2.1.5). Like direct objects, second objects are always marked with
      accusative case and are thereby distinguished from indirect objects. Unlike direct
      objects, second objects can never be registered in the auxiliary.
(iii) Indirect objects are not registered with an object bound pronoun in the auxiliary. Nor
      are they marked with accusative case. In fact, indirect objects are almost always marked
      with the dative case, the one exception being the allative indirect object of yardi 'put'.
      Like other core functions, indirect objects are semantically unrestricted: their
      interpretation depends on the verb with which they occur. Furthermore, unlike other
      complements and adjuncts, some indirect objects can feed reflexive and/or reciprocal    As has been pointed out to me by Bill McGregor and Lesley Stirling (pers comm.). it is not surprising
    that a verbless clause will have an objective meaning and a verbal clause a subjective meaning. In
    verbless clauses the speaker is imputing a quality upon the subject (i.e. 'objective') and in verbal clauses
    the speaker is describing a situation, event or state (such as that of 'feeling').
180      Chapter 7
        constructions, in which case the indirect object argument is registered on the auxiliary
        with the reflexive/reciprocal pronoun (see §5.1.1 and below).
   Table 7.1 shows the possible basic argument structures for verbs in Wambaya. Discussion
and examples of the different types follow the table. The finite clause complements of verbs
such as dîdîma `tell O that SCOMP', ngajbi `see that SCOMP', tunga `hear, remember that
SCOMP' are discussed in §8.2.1.3. Adjuncts and semantically restricted complements were
covered in the discussion of case marking in §4.4.
                             TABLE 7.1: BASIC ARGUMENT STRUCTURES8
    Note: Arguments listed in the first column are those registered in the auxiliary with a
    subject bound pronoun; those in the second column are registered with an object
    bound pronoun; arguments in the third column are not registered in the auxiliary at all.","[197, 198]"
"
4.7 LNDEFLNITE/INTERROGATIVES58
   There are five indefinite/interrogative roots in the corpus, which are used to indicate that
the (full) identity of the referent is unknown to the speaker. These forms are frequently used
in interrogative function, requesting the information about the referent's identity from the
addressee. This interrogative function, however, cannot be considered a part of the core
meaning of these forms as they can be used contexts that are not compatible with an
interrogative meaning, namely those in which they co-occur with the inferential enclitic =mijî
(see below).59 When combined with their various inflections, these five roots cover the
meanings 'someone, who', 'something, what', 'something, which', `for something, why',
'somewhere, where', `from somewhere, where from', 'some amount, how many/how
57 The alternation in the vowel of the stem is triggered by the following high back vowel of the dual suffix.
58 In Nordlinger 1993a I used the term 'ignorative' for this word class (following Karcevski 1969 and more
     recently Wierzbicka (e.g. 1980)). However, as Mushin (1991, 1995)   .      has pointed out, there are two
     components to these words: an ignorative component (which indicates that knowledge is at issue) and an
     epistemological component (which characterises the type of knowledge at issue). For this reason the
     more neutral term 'indefinite/interrogative' has been chosen. In other discussions of Australian languages
     these words have been referred to as `interrogatives' (e.g. Dixon 1972, 1977, Merlan 1994), 'inter-
     rogative/indefinite pronouns' (e.g. Austin 1981a, Morphy, 1983), 'indefinite pronouns' (Dench 1995),
     'indeterminates' (Donaldson 1980) and 'epistememes' (Mushin 1991, 1995).
59 This discussion has benefited from McGregor's (1990:146ff) discussion of such forms in Gooniyandi.
120 Chapter 4much', `sometime, when' and `somehow, how'.60 There is a strong tendency for indefinite/
interrogatives to be initial in the clause.
   As indicated by the term used, indefinite/interrogatives are found with two different
functions in the corpus: indefinite (4-249) and interrogative (4-250).61 In the former
function, they often co-occur with the enclitic -miji `INFER' (7.7.1.1).
   (4-249) Gayina=miji                       irr-a dîdîma.
             something.IV(ACC)=INFER 3PL.A-PST     tell
             They (must have) told him something./I don't know what they told him.
  (4-250) Gayina             irr-a       didima.
          something.IV(ACC) 3PL.A-PST tell
          They told him something./What did they tell him?
   Each of these examples expresses the fact that the speaker does not know what it was that
the subject told the object. As far as I can tell, the difference between the indefinite meaning
of example (4-249) and that of (4-250) is that in the former the speaker is indicating that
he/she is only inferring that anything was `told' at all. Such examples are often translated in
Aboriginal English using `must be', as in `I don't know what they told him, must be
something.'
   I will now discuss each of these indefinite/interrogatives individually. A general
interrogative particle is discussed in §7.5.1.","[137, 138]"
"42    Not all of the possible combinations are attested in the corpus. In fact. I have been able to get a complete
      set of these different case forms only for Classes I and II. I have not been able to get ergative/locative or
      dative forms of Class tit or Class tv demonstratives. The main reasons for these gaps are the infrequency
      with which Class III or Class Iv nouns occur in either the ergative/locative or dative cases. and the
      difficulty in forcing the demonstrative to be present on the rare occasions that these nouns do occur in
      these cases. In the few examples in which I succeeded in forcing a Class iv demonstrative in a transitive
      subject NP, the nominative form of the demonstrative was used:

      Chadwick (1978) also does not give ergative/locative or dative demonstratives for Classes ut and IV, so it.
      is unclear if it is a gap in the data or a gap in the system.
108    Chapter 4   The forms in Table 4.14 are organised with the proximate forms first (singular, dual then
plural) followed by the remote forms (singular, dual then plural). For comparison, the
demonstratives given in Chadwick (1978) for the other Eastern Group languages/dialects are
given following each set of Wambaya forms. As the nominative and accusative forms are
always homophonous in all languages, I have listed them together under the heading NOM/
ACC.

     characteristics outlined in the discussion in §4.6.1 below. They are very similar to the corresponding

     and nganaguwa 'thatii.sG.DAT', and may therefore have been borrowed from Binbinka. Note however.

44 I have called this case `LOC' on analogy with the Wambaya case although it is not exactly the same in all
      languages/dialects. While all the Eastern Group languages/dialects have one case suffix that is used to
      mark both ergative and locative case functions (-ni), both Gudanji and Ngarnga have an alternative case
     suffix that can also be used to mark locative case (-nbi). Ngarnga also has a separate instrumental case
     suffix, -warndu, unlike the McArthur dialects, which use the ergative/locative case suffix in this function
      (Chadwick 1978:161).

the preceding vowel, can be elided in fast or casual speech.

   The demonstratives in Wambaya have been morphologically conservative, retaining the
original prefixing system. Thus, gender in the demonstratives is indicated by prefixes, most
of which correspond with the gender suffixes found on Wambaya nominals (see §4.2.2 and
Appendix B for a discussion of gender marking). The following table gives both the gender
prefixes found on demonstratives and the main gender suffixes found on other nominals.
                               TABLE 4.15: GENDER MARKING

                                                   -a     -I   It can be seen in the above table that the Class II prefixes on demonstratives correspond
exactly with the first pair of Class II noun suffixes (-rna and -nga). The Class III absolutive
prefix also corresponds exactly with the Class III absolutive noun suffix. The Class I
absolutive prefix -î and the noun suffix ji are very similar and probably both derive from an
original prefix -ji, the initial consonant of which has lenited in the present-day forms. That
this is the original prefix is supported by the appearance of the prefix ji- in some Class I
demonstratives in Binbinka, such as jirriga `remote singular nominative/accusative Class I'.
The Class ry prefix -ya is probably related to the suffix -a found on some Class IV nouns and
modifiers. The fact that the gender prefixes on demonstratives are similar to the suffixes
found on other nominals supports the theory that gender suffixes on nominals may have
developed from the reduction of postposed demonstratives (see Appendix B and I. Green
1995 for a comparative discussion of gender marking in the Mirndi languages).
   The demonstrative system is easily analysable. All dual and plural forms can be derived
from the singular forms, and the singular forms are made up of a gender prefix, a stern and
either a proximate or a remote marker. The complete structure of a demonstrative can be
schematised as follows:
      Gender prefix + Stem + `Distance' + Number(.Gender) + Case
      Notes:
        (i) `Distance' refers to `proximate' versus `remote'.
       (ii) The `number' slot only contains gender marking in plural number.
112     Chapter 4
         (iii) There are two forms in which the order of the `number' and the `distance'
               suffixes are reversed: inuwuliyaga `remote dual nominative/accusative Class I'
               and nanawuliyaga `remote dual nominative/accusative Class II'.
     The different forms for each of these categories are as follows:
Gender prefixes (ABS; NABS)
    Class I: {i-; ni-}
    Class II: {na-; nga-}
    Class III: {ma-; ?}
    Class Iv: {ya-; ?}
Stem
        Nominative, Accusative:        { -ni- (I); -na- (II, Iv); -ma- (III) }45
        Ergative/Locative:             { -nki- (I, II), -nka- (II) }46
        Dative:                        {-naga-
   When the remote suffix -yaga is added to the stem, the final low vowel of the stem
becomes high. Thus, -na- becomes -ni-yaga; -naga- becomes -nagî-yaga, and so forth.
   Evans (1990) discusses the tendency in Australian languages for demonstratives to derive
from verbs of stance (i.e. `sit', `stand' or `lie') or verbs of perception (i.e. `see, look').
Thus, it is possible that the nominative and accusative demonstrative stems in Wambaya, if
their underlying form is taken to be -na- (see footnote 45), may have developed from the
common non-Pama-Nyungan verb na meaning `see, look' (Evans 1990:144).
    The dative stem -naga- appears to be made up of the nominative/accusative stem -na-
followed by the suffix -ga which occurs with all non-singular object and oblique free
pronouns in Ngarnga and Gudanji (Chadwick 1978:51), and appears in Wambaya non-
singular oblique pronouns with the addition of the comitative suffix; for example, mirndiga-
yîlî `1DU.INC.OBL-COMIT'.
Distance
      Proximate: {-0}
      Remote:    {-yaga/-ya; -ma)
   The remote suffix -yaga is reduced to -ya when it is followed by either the dual or the
plural suffix. The remote suffix -ma is found only in the singular nominative/accusative
forms.
     There are a couple of examples in the corpus in which both remote suffixes are used:
45  The variation in the form of the stem can probably be explained in terms of vowel harmony and analogic
    nasal assimilation. Thus, if the underlying form is taken to be -na-, then the Class i form (-ni-) could be
    explained in terms of vowel harmony triggered by the preceding high vowel in the prefix, and the Class
    tit form (-ma-) as assimilation of the alveolar nasal in the stem to the bilabial nasal of the prefix. There
    is no evidence that these assimilation processes are productive synchronically (most vowel harmony is
    regressive (see §2.3.4.3) and there are no other known instances of such nasal assimilation). However,
    the presence of the alveolar nasal in the stem of the two Class iii Binbinka demonstratives ntaniga
    `remote singular nominative/accusative Class w' and manigula `remote dual nominative/accusative Class
    Ill' adds support to the theory that the Wambaya Class Ili stem may have derived from one containing an
    alveolar nasal.
46 Note that this stem becomes -nka- in Class ti proximate non-singular forms, but elsewhere remains -nki.
                                                                                         Nominals     113        i-na-ma-yaga47 remote singular nominative/accusative Class I
        na-na-ma-yaga remote singular nominative/accusative Class II
   There does not appear to be any difference in meaning between these forms and the
corresponding forms in which only one remote suffix is present.
Number
    Singular. { -0 }
    Dual:      {-wulu (ABS), -wulî (NABS)}48
    Plural:    {-gunji (I, ABS), -gunyi (I, NABS); -gunya (II, ABS and NABS); -gunyma
               ABS); -gunja (IV, ABS) }49
   Note that the plural number markers also indicate gender.
Fa ce   Although the sterns indicate case, case is also separately marked at the end of the
demonstrative. Except with the nominative and accusative cases, the form of the case suffix is
dependent on the number of the demonstrative.
        Nominative, Accusative: { -0)
        Ergative/Locative: SG { -0 }
                          DU { ji )
                          PL { -ni}
        Dative:           SG { -0)
                          DU Via}
                          PL {-nka}
   The dual and plural case suffixes are regular for nominals: the regular nominal suffixes are
-0 for both the nominative case and the accusative case, -ni for the ergative/locative case and
-nka for the dative case, and nominals inflected with the dual suffix take -ji in the
ergative/locative case and -ja in the dative case. The only aspect of case marking that is
unusual to demonstratives is that the singular forms have a zero inflection for the
ergative/locative case and the dative case. Usually a singular nominal would take the regular
ergative/locative and dative case suffixes (see §4.4).
   Below are some selected Class I forms illustrating this morphological structure.","[125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131]"

8.1 NON-FINITE SUBORDINATE CLAUSES
   Non-finite subordinate clauses are reduced clauses. They are reduced in four ways: (i)
they do not contain an auxiliary; (ii) they provide no information concerning tense, aspect and
mood; (iii) they are marked as subordinate with either the infinitive suffix or one of three
nominal case suffixes (see below); and (iv) their subject is obligatorily deleted under co-
reference with a main clause subject or object argument.
    There are three types of non-finite subordinate clauses in Wambaya: prior (the subordinate
clause situation precedes that of the main clause), simultaneous (the subordinate clause
situation is concurrent with that of the main clause) and purposive (the situation described by
the subordinate clause follows, and is the purpose of, that of the main clause). A system of
switch-reference operates when the two clauses are simultaneous. There is no switch-
reference in purposive subordinate clauses, and there is not sufficient data to determine the
situation for prior subordinate clauses.
   Table 8.1 shows the inflections that appear on verbs in non-finite subordinate clauses,
where SS (Same Subject) means that the (omitted) subject of the subordinate clause is co-
referential with that of the main clause and DS (Different Subject) means that the subject of the
subordinate clause is co-referential with the direct object of the main clause) For a discussion
of the form of these suffixes as verbal inflections see §6.1.
         TABLE 8.1: VERBAL INFLECTIONS IN NON-FINITE SUBORDINATE CLAUSES                                             SS                 DS

                                 PURP.    -nka/-barda           -nka
   As is clear in Table 8.1, the pattern of verbal marking in these clauses is complex. The
clearest case is when the two clauses are simultaneous; in this situation the ergativellocative
    More research is needed to determine whether the subject of the subordinate clause can be co-referential
    with a main clause NP other than subject or direct object (as it can in Warlpiri, for example (Hale 1976)).
    There is one example in the corpus in which a verb with this inflection is not in a simultaneous
    subordinate clause. In this example, (7-80), it functions as an argument of the verb ganjimi `finish
    doing'.

(8-2)) and the infinitive suffix -barda/-warda is used when the subordinate subject is co-
referential with the main clause direct object ((8-3) to (8-5)). Thus in this case there is switch-
reference.3 Simultaneous non-finite clauses usually function as adjuncts modifying the
subject ((8-1), (8-2)) or the object (8-3). The latter is particularly common with verbs of
perception ((8-4), (8-5)).4,5

there are no co-referential arguments it is not possible to use a non-finite subordinate clause; a
finite clause must be used instead.

  The ablative case suffix -nnga is used in prior clauses (examples (8-7), (8-8)) (the few
examples of this type of clause in the corpus all have co-referential subjects). These can
    Dench and Evans (1988:30) argue that the use of what appears to be the locative case suffix to mark
    same subject occurs only in languages in which this suffix also marks ergative case and can therefore be
    seen to have arisen through a system of antecedant agreement with a main clause ergative subject, rather
    than being related to a locative function. Thus initially it would have appeared only in subordinate
    clauses controlled by main clause ergative subjects, and would then have extended to all subject-
    controlled subordinate clauses. While this may explain the development of this pattern of marking in
    languages such as Wambaya, in which ergative and locative functions are marked with one case suffix, it
    does not explain the use of the locative suffix to mark same subject in languages such as Jingili
    (Chadwick 1975) and Bilinara (Nordlinger 1990), in which ergative case and locative case are marked with
    separate suffixes.
    In this chapter I will use square brackets to identify the subordinate clause.
    An alternative analysis of these clauses with perception verbs is to treat them as object complements,
    analogous to the subject complements of certain intransitive verbs discussed in §7.2.2.

clause (8-7) or can describe the prior event that led to that of the main clause (8-8).6

   The dative case suffix -nka is used in purposive clauses (examples (8-9) and (8-10)).
These are usually adjuncts (8-10), but may also be verbal complements of certain verbs like
dirndirrimî `teach' (8-12). Purposive subordinate clauses differ from those mentioned above
in that an object NP does not simply appear in the same case that it would in a main clause,
but must be marked with dative case, like the verb ((8-9), (8-10)). The dative suffix -nka is
used in any purposive clause, regardless of whether the subordinate subject is co-referential
with the subject or object NP in the matrix clause. Thus, there is no switch-reference in
purposive clauses.

7.2.3.2 REFLEXIVE VERBS WITH SUBJECT COMPLEMENTS
   There are two reflexive verbs which subcategorise for subject complements: manku `feel
SubjCOMP' and yardî `turn into SubjCOMP'. With manku the subject complement expresses
the mental or physical state attributed to the subject; with yardi it refers to the entity that the
subject `turned into'. Examples include:
   (7-66)   Manku ngi-ngg-a       gurijbirna.
            hear     I SG.A-RR-NF good.II(NOM)
            I feel good.
   (7-67)   Yardi gini-ngg-a        barnanggi.
            put.   3SG.M.A-RR-NF bird.sp.I(NOM)
            He turned himself into a barnanggi
   Each of these verbs has an alternative case frame which is non-reflexive: nwnku is also a
simple transitive verb meaning `hear, think about'; and yardî is also a ditransitive verb
meaning `put'. However, the reflexive use discussed here is considered to be basic rather
than derived (at least, synchronically) as the meanings are sufficiently different from the non-
reflexive forms to consider them to be different lexemes synchronically. A derived reflexive
form of transitive manku, for example, would mean `hear oneself, think about oneself' and
would not subcategorise for the type of subject complement present in example (7-66) above.
186    Chapter 77.2.4 SEMITRANSITIVE VERBS
   Semitransitive verbs require an nominative subject and a dative indirect object. The indirect
object is not cross-referenced in the auxiliary. The semitransitive verbs in the corpus include
those describing (i) actions of searching or anticipation, such as ayani `look for IO', yandu
`wait for IO' and maranbi `feel around for I0'; (ii) verbal or non-verbal communication
towards or about entities, such as ardbi `call out to I0', ngarlwi `talk to IO, talk about I0',
garni `smile at 10'; and others such as kiji 'be gone for a long time from I0', durra `be
frightened of IO' and bundurrijbi `be/get full of IO, be/get pregnant with IO'.
   (7-68)   Juwa-nka gi-n                 ayani babanya.

            The old man waited for you.

            be.absent 3DU.S(NP)-PROG ISG.OBL that.one.I.DU.NOM
            They've been gone from me for a long time.
   Some of these semitransitive verbs can also occur as intransitive verbs, without the
indirect object. Examples were given in §7.2.2.1 above, of which two are repeated here.
   (7-71)   Garni gî-n            (ngarra).
            smile 3SG.S(PR)-PROG (1SG.OBL)
            He smiling (at me).
   (7-72)   Durra          ngî         (janyî-nka).
            be.frightened 1 SG.S(PR) (dog.I-DAT)
            I'm frightened (of the dog).
   Although these indirect objects are not cross-referenced with an object bound pronoun in
the auxiliary (example (7-73)), they can feed reflexive/reciprocal constructions, in which case
they are represented with the reflexive/reciprocal bound pronoun (7-74). This is one way in
which they can be distinguished from dative marked adjuncts (7-75) (see §3.2 for further
discussion).
   (7-73)   Ayanî ngîl*ngi-ny-a            nganga.
            look.for ISG.S(PR)/1SG.A-20-NF 2SG.OBL

   (7-74)   Ayanî ngurlu-ngg-a.

            We're cooking for each other. (The only possible meaning is `We're cooking
            each other'.)
  The interaction of indirect objects and adjuncts with reflexive/reciprocal constructions has
not yet been fully explored: it may be that only some indirect objects can feed such
contructions and/or that some adjuncts can do so as well. Further investigation is required.

   Transitive verbs are characterised by the fact that they subcategorise for an ergative subject
argument and only one other obligatory object argument (in this respect they differ from
ditransitive verbs which require two object-type arguments).","[203, 204, 205]"
"
5.4 THE AUXILIARY IN THE CLAUSE
   The auxiliary occurs in second position in the clause, following the initial word or (less
commonly) the initial NP constituent.18 For examples of the auxiliary following the initial
word of the clause see all of the examples given above. An example of the auxiliary following
an initial NP constituent is:
  (5-82)    Ngarri               alaji           gî-n                 mîna ngarri-yili.
            ISG.POSS.I(NOM) boy.I(NOM) 3SG.S(PR)-PROG sit                      1SG.OBL-COMIT
            My son lives with me.
   The main clause verb and its object may not, however, precede the auxiliary. This is
strong evidence against the existence of a VP in Wambaya.
  (5-83)    *Daguma janji           ng-a.
            hit          dog.I(ACC) 1SG.A-PST
            I hit the dog.
  The initial constituent may be a verb with a subordinate inflection and still count as a
constituent for the purposes of auxiliary placement:
  (5-84)    Manku-ji-nka îrri-n        yarru.
            hear-TH-DAT 3PL.S(NP)-PROG go
            They are coming to listen.",[171]
"
7.2.2.4 NGARLWI `TALK (LANGUAGE) (TO IO)'
   Ngarlwi is unique in that it subcategorises for a nominative subject NP and two optional
object arguments: an accusative object referring to the language spoken (usually called a
cognate object, e.g. Austin 1982) and a dative indirect object. It can, therefore, appear in four
different case frames, the most of any verb in the corpus: simple intransitive (example (7-
184     Chapter 758)), intransitive with cognate object (7-59), semitransitive (7-60), and semitransitive with
cognate object (7-61).11
     (7-58)   Ngarlwî ngurru-n.
              talk      1PL.INC.S(NP)-PROG
              We're talking.
     (7-59)   Ngarlwî gi            ngarlana.
              talk       3SG.S(PR) language.IV(ACC)
              He talks (the Wambaya) language.
     (7-60)   Ngarlwi ngi-n             nganga.
              talk       ISG.S(PR)-PROG 2SG.OBL
              I'm talking to you.
     (7-61)   Ngarlwi wurl-aji         jingulu irra,      gujinya       irda.
              talk     3DU.S-HAB.PST            3PL.OBL mother.II(NOM) father.I(NOM)
              My mother and father always spoke Jingulu to them.
   While there are other other verbs that occur with cognate objects (see §7.2.5.2), ngarlwi is
unique in that in clauses with the cognate object, the subject remains nominative and is
registered by an `intransitive subject' bound pronoun in the auxiliary. Other verbs taking
cognate objects, such as nijbi `sing (a song)' take ergative subjects which are registered by
`transitive subject' bound pronouns, when they occur in that case frame.","[201, 202]"
"3.1.1.2 VERBS
   Most of the information that is traditionally associated with verbs, such as tense, aspect
and mood, is found in the auxiliary in Wambaya. Verbs themselves have comparatively few
inflectional possibilities. In main clauses verbs make a `future'/`non-future' (or unmarked)
distinction with the future form also used in imperative constructions. The inflectional
possibilities for verbs are discussed in §6.1. In non-finite subordinate clauses verbs are
inflected with either the infinitive suffix -barda; or one of three nominal suffixes — the
ergative/locative -nî, the ablative -nnga or the dative -nka — which indicate, respectively,
whether the action described in the subordinate clause occurs concurrently, occurred
previously, or will follow that of the main clause. The use of these suffixes with verbs is
discussed in detail in §6.1 and §8.1. There is also a reduplication process which provides
some aspectual information (see §6.1.7). There are many derivational possibilities for verbs.
Verbs can be made into transitive verbs; causative verbs; and various types of nouns, both
                                                        Parts of speech and other preliminaries   51agentive and instrumental. The verb-to-verb derivational processes are discussed in §6.2.1,
and the verb-to-nominal processes in §4.5.2.
    Verbs in main clauses must always be accompanied by an auxiliary, which registers the
main arguments of the clause and often provides the only tense and aspect information. This
is in contrast with nominal predicates, which obligatorily occur without the auxiliary. There is
a tendency for verbs to occur in initial position in the clause: a survey of texts showed that
61% of verbal clauses were verb-initial.
   There is a group of verbs which, although clearly verbs in their own right, have another
function as adverbs, modifying the main verb in the clause. This is one case in which the
mutual exclusivity of word-class membership appears to be violated. The most common
examples of this type of construction involve the verbs gurinymi `make good' and ganjîmi
`finish', which can be used as modifiers meaning `well, properly' and `all' respectively. In
these constructions it is only the main verb that takes the tense inflection; the modifying verb
remains unmarked for tense. Some examples of these verbs functioning as adverbs, and also
as verbs, are:
  (3-9) a. Gunny-mi ng-u      gulug-ba.
           good-FAC 1SG.S-FUT sleep-FUT
           I will sleep well.
          b. Gunny-ma       ng-u.
             good-FAC.FUT 1SG.A-FUT
             I will fix it.
  (3-10) a. Gaj-ba gun-u        ganjimi.
            eat-FUT 3SG.M.A-FUT finish
            He will eat it all.
          b. Ganjima gun-u.
             finish.FUT 3SG.M.A-FUT
             He'll finish it.
   Examples of this type of construction with other modifying verbs include:
  (3-11) Barngala           ngi-n          mîrra.
         have.legs.crossed 1SG.S(PR)-PROG sit
         I'm sitting with my legs crossed.
  (3-12) Jirrbali        gî-n           nanîyaga      gulugbî.
         lie.on.stomach 3SG.S(PR)-PROG that.II.SG.NOM sleep
         She's sleeping on her stomach.
   The following examples demonstrate that these modifiers are verbs as well, since they are
capable of taking the future tense inflection and appearing alone without another verb:
   (3-13) Barngali-j-ba              giliyaga!
          have.crossed.legs-TH-FUT there
          Sit down with your legs crossed over there!
   (3-14) Jirrbali-j-ba!
          lie.on. stomach-TH-FUT
          Lie on your stomach!
52     Chapter 3   There is only one form that has doubtful status as a verb. This form, darridarri `be in a
line', is only ever found in the modifying function. It was not possible to get an example of
darrîdarri occurring alone.
     (3-15) Darridarri irri-n           mîrra.
            be.in.a.line 3PL.S(NP)-PROG sit
            They're sitting in a line.
     (3-16) Darrîdarri gîrr     garran-ba!
            be.in.a.line PL.IMP stand-FUT
            Stand in a line!
   However, rather than place darridarri in a word class of its own, I will consider it part of
the verb word class by analogy with other modifying verbs such as those in examples (3-11)
and (3-12) above.
     For a more detailed discussion of clauses containing two verbs see §7.4.1.","[68, 69, 70]"

    An interesting feature of this system of verbal marking, however, is that the infinitive
suffix -barda can also be used in prior clauses (example (8-14)) and purposive clauses ((8-
15), (8-16)), in which the subjects of the two clauses are co-referential. (Due to lack of data it
is not possible to determine if -barda can also be used in these types of clauses when it is the
main clause object that is the pivot). Thus, it is only when the two clauses are simultaneous6     The examples are so few that it is not possible to tell whether the non-finite clause in this case is a
      complement of the verb, or an adjunct.
7     This is the Gudanji form of the auxiliary.
8     Note that the NP Binbinka is not inflected with the dative case, as objects of purposive clauses usually
      are. This is probably ruled out for phonological reasons, since the dative suffix is identical to the final
      syllable of the NP and would yield Binbinka-nka.
                                                                      Syntax of complex sentences    215that the infinitive suffix is restricted to different subject marking. Note that the object NP in a
purposive clause still must be in the dative case, even if the verb is marked with the infinitive
suffix (8-16).

   Austin (198 lb) shows switch-reference to be an areal feature in Australia; languages
which have some sort of switch-reference system are spoken in a continuous area, extending
from the Indian Ocean through to western Queensland (p.329). As Wambaya falls within this
area, it is therefore predictable that it would have some form of switch-reference. In fact the
switch-reference system in Wambaya is typical for languages of the area in that the
e gative/locative_ suffix is used to mark same subject, and there is no switch-reference in
purposive clauses. The switch-reference systems of surrounding languages such as Jingili,
Garrwa, Wagaya and Alyawarra also have these characteristics (Austin 1981b:326-328).
However, the Wambaya switch-reference system differs from those of these surrounding
languages in that the infinitive case suffix, rather than the allative case suffix, is used to mark
different subject.
   As in the majority of examples above, the usual case is for the non-finite clause to follow
the main clause. However, it may also appear initially, preceding the auxiliary (examples (8-
17), (8-18), see also (8-1) above), and may even appear embedded within the main clause
((8-19) to (8-22)). The only examples of this latter possibility is when the subordinate clause
contains only a verb;9 and in all these examples the subordinate clause is followed
immediately by the controlling NP in the main clause.1 o

v    Although examples such as (8-19) to (8-22) are found in spontaneous speech, speakers do not generally
     accept them as grammatical when presented with them out of context. Thus, it is difficult to get
     judgements on whether such embedding is also possible with more complex non-finite subordinate
     clauses (i.e. those containing object NPs) since speakers generally judge all embedded examples to be
     ungrammatical.

   In other Australian languages such as Warlpiri (Simpson 1988, 1991) and Kayardild
(Evans 1995a), the verb in clauses such as these is marked with a derivational nominalising
suffix; thus non-finite subordinate clauses in these languages are clearly NPs. In Wambaya,
however, the category of these clauses is less clear. Like NPs, non-finite subordinate clauses
can be inflected with nominal case suffixes; and they can appear embedded within the main
clause (example (8-22)) or before the auxiliary (8-17) — two positions that are available to
NPs, but not to finite clauses. However, there is no nominalising suffix; the subordinating
suffix is attached directly to the verb stem. Furthermore, unlike other derived nominals, non-
finite subordinate clauses do not have to agree in case with the head noun that they modify
and nor are they marked for gender. The situation is made more complex by the fact that
different non-finite subordinate clauses have different characteristics. Simultaneous
subordinate clauses, for example, also differ from derived NPs in that they do not assign
dative case to their object NPs; and they cannot function as predicates in verbless clauses.
Purposive non-finite subordinate clauses, on the other hand, do have both of these
properties, and thus appear to be `more nominal' in their behaviour.) ""
8.1.1 SENTENTIAL CAUSATIVES
  There are two examples of sentential causatives in the corpus. Both examples contain
purposive non-finite subordinate clauses.

"82 Note that this makes predictions about auxiliary placement in inalienable constructions: if the
     'possessor' and the 'possessed' belong to different NPs one would expect that it is not possible for both
     to precede the auxiliary in one clause. Unfortunately the corpus does not contain the relevent data to
     check this.

                                        THE AUXILIARY    The auxiliary in Wambaya contains bound pronouns that represent the subject and object
(if present) of the clause, as well as affixes that provide tense, aspect, mood and directional
information. The auxiliary occurs in second position an d is usually obligatory in every main
verbal clause; it can be omitted only under highly restricted conditions (see §5.4). The basic
structure of the auxiliary is as follows:
     Subject + (Object) + Tense/aspect/mood/directional
   A maximum of two arguments can be registered in the auxiliary: the subject and the direct
object.' With ditransitive verbs it is the recipient which is registered. In all examples in the
corpus, this argument is animate while the other argument that is not registered is inanimate.2
Some examples are:
  (5-1)     Didima ngiyi-ng-a       marranya.
            tell     3SG.NM.A-IO-NF yarn.IV(ACC)
            She told me a yarn.
   (5-2)    Jiyawu ngi-ny-a      danya.
            give     ISG.A-20-NF clothes.IV(ACC)
            I gave you clothes.
  Only direct objects can be registered in the auxiliary. Indirect objects of semitransitive
verbs, for example, are not registered:
   (5-3)    Yandu ng-a          nganga.
            wait     ISG.S-PST 2SG.OBL
            I waited for you.
   As evident in the above structural template, the auxiliary in Wambaya contains no verbal
root (at least synchronically). Although it is sometimes claimed that an auxiliary by definition
must be verbal, Schachter (1985:41) argues that it is possible for the class of auxiliaries to
include non-verbs, as in languages such as Hausa. I thereby follow the arguments of
Schachter in describing the Wambaya part of speech as an auxiliary despite the fact that it is
synchronically non-verbal. Following are some examples of auxiliaries in Wambaya.","[153, 154, 155]"
"
47 The high vowel of the Class I nominative/accusative stem is lowered before the remote suffix -ma. This
    is presumably attributable to vowel harmony. Similarly, when this stem is immediately followed by the
    dual suffix -wulu, the high front vowel of the stem becomes back, in harmony with the back vowels of
    the suffix. Thus: i-ni 'proximate singular nominative/accusative Class l' but i-nu-wulu 'proximate dual
    nominative/accusative Class t'..
48 Note that gender is not marked with the dual number suffix (see §4.3.2.1).
49
    This morpheme can be segmented into a root -guny- followed by the regular gender marking suffixes: -ji
    (1. ABS), -nyi O. NABS); -nya (II. ABS and NABS); -ma (III. ABS); -ja (IV. ABS). There is a regular
    morphophonemic rule which deletes one of two sequential identical consonants (i.e. -guny- `plural' +
    -nya `n (ABS)' > -gunya); see §2.3.5.

   For the purposes of simplicity however, I will not segment the demonstratives in the
examples in this description. Instead, I will give them in an unsegmented form and simply
indicate in the gloss the morphological structure. For example:
      naniyaga     that.ILSG.NOM, that.11.SG.ACC
      ninagawulija this.LDU.DAT
Other Demonstratives
   There are two other types of demonstratives found in the corpus: demonstratives in the
comitative case and possessive demonstratives. As there are only a few examples of each
type, I have chosen to discuss them separately, instead of including them in the tables and
discussion above.
(i) Demonstratives in the comitative case:
    In these examples, the regular comitative case suffix (-mbîli) replaces the ergative/locative
suffix in the ergative/locative form of the demonstrative. There are only two examples of this
type of demonstrative, both of which have plural number:
   (4-228) Mirrang-ba ng-u          ngankagunyambi!i/ninkigunyimbili.
           sit-FUT       I SG.S-FUT this.II.PL.COMIT/thi s.LPL.COMIT
           I'm going to sit down with these women/men.
   The fact that these demonstratives are based on the respective ergative/locative forms
suggests that what has been described as the ergative/locative stem may in fact be a more
general oblique stem. One argument against this, however, is the fact that it does not occur in
the dative forms.
(ii) Possessive demonstratives.
    These demonstratives are made up of a non-absolutive gender prefix agreeing with the
possessor, the nominative/accusative demonstrative stem -na-, the possessive suffix -gan-5o
(this suffix is also found on possessive pronouns — see §4.8) and a gender suffix agreeing
with the possessed noun. Thus, these demonstratives agree in gender with both the possessor
and the possessed. In the remote forms, the remote suffix -yaga occurs after the gender
suffix. The only examples of these demonstratives are in the nominative case, and have both
singular possessor and singular possessee nouns. A lot more work is needed in order to
obtain all the other forms of these demonstratives. Table 4.16 contains the forms that are
present in the corpus:
50 The fi nal nasal of this suffix is dropped before another apical nasal (such as in the Class It suffix -rna)
    and assimilates to the place of articulation of a following palatal or velar stop.
                                                                                             Nominals     115                               TABLE 4.16: POSSESSIVE DEMONSTRATIVES                                    POSSESSED NOUN

   The gender suffixes are regular and are the same as for possessive pronouns (see §4.8):
-.ii (I), -n is (II), -ma (III), -ga (P.0.51
   Some examples of these possessive demonstratives are:

           boy.I(NOM) that.II.SG.POSS.I(NOM)
           that woman's little boy
4.6.2 FUNCTION
  Demonstratives can be used as deictic determiners qualifying a noun (examples (4-233)
and (4-234)), or as deictic demonstrative pronouns alone in the NP (4-235) and (4-236).
   (4-233) Ngankiyaga      janya-ni   ngiyî-ng-a    dawu.
           that.II.SG.LOC dog.II-LOC 3SG.NM.A-I0-NF bite
           That (female) dog bit me.
   (4-234) Mama              burnaringma       ng-a     nawu.
           this.III.SG.ACC wild.orange.III.ACC ISG.A-PST step.on
           I sat on this orange.
   (4-235) Dagunta irri-ngg-a       inigunji.
           hit        3PL.A-RR-NF this.I.PL.NOM
           These ones are fighting.5 t The -ga which is found with the dative demonstratives (as in ninaga 'this.t.SG.DAT') is different from the
     -gan- which derives possessive pronouns and demonstratives (at least synchronically). This is shown by
     the fact that the final nasal found with the possessive suffix -gan- does not show up in the dative
     demonstrative suffix -ga, even when it is not word-final as in ni-na-ga-gunvi-nka 'this.I.PL.DAT'. If these
     two are the same suffix, it is difficult to explain why a nasal would appear in some circumstances and
     not in others.
52 This example is mysterious: it is not clear why the demonstrative is possessive, as the dreaming (see
     Appendix A, Text 4) is about the Peewee, rather than possessed by him.
116     Chapter 4
     (4-236) Ngarl-warlirna     nanamayaga.
             talk-AGNT.II(NOM) that.II.SG.NOM
             That woman's a chatterbox.
   In this function, the difference between the two types is very similar to the difference
between `this' and `that' in English. The proximate forms are usually used to refer to things
that are close to the speaker, while the remote forms are used for things that are further away
from the speaker. The proximate forms can also be used with a presentative function; similar
to the use of `here' in an English sentence such as `here's something interesting going on'.
Thus in the following example, taken from Text A.1, the fire is referred to with the
demonstrative yana despite the fact that it is a considerable distance from the speaker.
     (4-237) ""Ngangaba       yana              gi-n      trajbi.""
              fire.IV(NOM) this.IV.SG.NOM 3SG.S(PR)-PROG bum
             ""There's a fire burning (there).""
   Demonstratives also perform an important discourse function: they are used in the
organisation of information and tracking of reference. Demonstratives can be used to refer to
things previously mentioned or alluded to in discourse. The difference between the proximate
and remote demonstratives is metaphorically extended into this function. Proximate forms are
used when the antecedent or discourse topic is close (in terms of time of utterance) to the
utterance of the demonstrative (generally in either the same or preceding clause, but no more
than two clauses back):53

              There used to be a few houses. (Now) they've built lots of them.
   The following example is taken from Text 1 (Appendix A). In the clauses leading up to
this one, the two eaglehawks are telling their two sons that they should prepare a bed for the
two boys who have to leave early in the morning. Then there is one short sentence in which it
is said that the two eaglehawks pick up a round stone and a digging stick (by now all four
other characters are asleep) and:
     (4-240) Bunjunymi wurlu-n            inuwulu          wurlu-n   gulugbi.

             They sneak up on the two boys (who) are sleeping.
   When the thing being referred to was uttered more than a couple of clauses away, or if
there is another intervening discourse topic between the anaphoric element and its antecedant,
a remote demonstrative is used. The following sequence is taken from Text 6 (Appendix A).
The remote demonstrative refers to `the moon', mentioned a few clauses back. As there is an
intervening topic (indilyawurna), a remote demonstrative is used.","[131, 132, 133, 134]"

7.2.1 IMPERSONAL VERBS
   Impersonal verbs in Wambaya are characterised by the fact that they cannot co-occur with
an overt subject NP although a (third person singular) subject bound pronoun is always
present in the auxiliary. There are three impersonal verbs in the corpus. Two of these, ngajirri
`be cold' and ngarrangarra `be hot', are impersonal only when they are used with reference to
the weather. They have another use as simple intransitive verbs, in which case they take a
nominative subject NP and are not impersonal. An example of their impersonal use is:8     Subject and object arguments are always registered in the auxiliary, and thus the argument NPS are often
      omitted (especially if first or second person). Other arguments can also be ellipsed under certain discourse
      conditions, although these conditions are not yet well understood.
9     This is a purposive non-finite subordinate clause. It usually consists of just a verb inflected with the
      dative case, but can also contain NP arguments (see example (7-50)). A few verbs in the corpus can
      optionally take a purposive complement instead of a nominal argument (see below).
                                                                  Syntax of simple sentences •   181  (7-40)    Ngarrangarra/ngajirri gi-n           jalanyi.

            It's hot/cold today.
  The third impersonal verb in the corpus, barnamuluma 'flash lightning', is particularly
unusual as it also requires the presence of the reflexive/reciprocal bound pronoun in the
auxiliary:

"5     In dreamtime stories where this sort of a construction is common (e.g. `make oneself into a bird'), the
      verb yardi `put' is used reflexively, with the resultant state expressed as a subject complement. Thus:
          J1anvila            wurlu-ngg-a yardi bungmaj-bulu.
          eaglehawk.II(ACC) 3DU.A-RR-NF put            old.person-DU(ACC)
          The two old women turned themselves into eaglehawks.
6     This is a type of bird — see Text 2 in Appendix A.
7     Wierzbicka (1988:116-117) discusses such constructions in Japanese. However, in Japanese these
      experiential sentences are only possible in the first person.
                                                                   Parts of speech and other preliminaries     49  For a more detailed discussion of verbless clauses and the use of mina as a copula-like
verb see §7.1.
   These adjectives are doubly interesting as they each have a homophonous verb form which
has the same meaning as the subjective meaning of the adjective. That these are verbs and not
adjectives is shown in the following examples in which the form co-occurs with an auxiliary
and takes no gender agreement with the subject NP.8
    (3-6)    Bagijbi gi            juruma.
             feel.bad 3SG.S(PR) stomach.I1I(NOM)
             He feels no good in the stomach.
    (3-7) Gurzjbi g-u             marala            ngaji-ni.
          feel.good 3SG.S-FUT heart.IV(NOM) see-LOC
          She will be happy to see (her). (lit. Her heart will feel good seeing (her).)
(iii) Free Pronouns
    Free pronouns form a small, closed class. They are referred to as 'free' to differentiate
them from the 'bound' pronouns that form part of the auxiliary (discussed below). Free
pronouns distinguish person (first, second and third), number (singular, dual and plural) and.
make an inclusive/exclusive distinction in the first person non-singular. There are no third
person singular subject or object pronouns; demonstratives are used instead.
   Free pronouns have a different system of case marking from nouns and adjectives. While
nouns and adjectives have an ergative/absolutive system of case marking, free pronouns have
a nominative/accusative declension with nominative and ergative case forms being
homophonous- Free pronouns also have an oblique form which is used in the dative case and
as the base for the addition of other case suffixes such as the comitative. In the case of non-
singular pronouns, this oblique form is homophonous with the accusative case form.
a    It is interesting to consider the possible relationship between the verbs and their corresponding adjectives.
     The final jbi of the adjective gurijbi (and also bagijbi) is identical to a final sequence that in Wambaya is
     quite distinctively verbal. There are many verbs that have this form: ngajbi 'see', gajbi 'eat', nyagajbi 'be
     tired', and it is also found in verbs derived from adjectives with the inchoative suffix jbi: yarduga
     'strong' (Iv) becomes varduga jbi 'become strong' (see §6.2.2.1). This suggests that the adjective gurijbi
     may be derived from the verb gurijbi, thereby accounting for its verb-like form. This theory is supported
     by the other gender forms of the adjective which are all based on this (verbal) form. The usual case
     among adjectives is for the Class iv form to he identical to the root, and therefore to serve as the base for
     the derivation of the other gender forms (see §4.2.2). However with gurijbi it is the Class I form (which
     is identical to the verbal form) from which the other forms are derived. This is shown most clearly by the
     Class II form gurijbi-rna in which the Class Ii gender suffix is simply added on to the full Class I form.
     The situation with bagijbi is different in at least two respects. Firstly, there is some variation among
     speakers as to whether the Class I form of the adjective is correctly pronounced bagijbi or bagiji. For
     some speakers either form is possible, for others only the latter is possible as the Class I form of the
     adjective. And secondly, the other gender forms are not derived from the Class I (and verbal) form, as is
     the case with gurijbi, but are clearly all derived (quite regularly) from a common root bagig - :
          Class I     bagiji/(bagijbi)
          Class 11 bagi-nga
          Class III baging-ma
          Class Iv bagi-ga
     The verbal form bagijbi is clearly also derived from this root.
     The next question is why, if the Class I form of the adjective is actually bagiji, it is often pronounced
     bagijbi, which is the verbal form? It seems quite probable that this could have happened on analogy with
     gurijbi, particularly as it is quite common in fast speech for both gurijbi and bagijbi to he pronounced
     guriji and bagiji respectively (even for the verbal form).
50     Chapter 3Singular pronouns have homophonous nominative, accusative and ergative case forms and
then a different oblique form. Free pronouns are discussed in §4.8.
(iv) Demonstratives
   Demonstratives in Wambaya make a two-way spatial distinction which is roughly
comparable to the distinction in English between `this' and `that'. Demonstratives must also
agree with their referent in case, gender and number. Like nouns and adjectives,
demonstratives can occur alone as the head of a NP, or function as a modifier. Demonstratives
are discussed in §4.6.
(v) Locational nominals
   These nominals are inherently locative and include the compass directionals (langga
`north', ngîrnii `south', gagarra `east', bayungu `west'), other general directionals (gayangga
`up', jangi `down'), locational demonstratives (gili `here', gîlîyaga `there') and other
locationals such as murrgu `inside'. Although these locational nominals can be inflected with
the allative and ablative cases, they are distinguished from other nominals by not taking the
locative case; they occur uninflected in a locative NP:
     (3-8)   Mirra gî-n              murrgu.
             sit    3SG.S(PR)-PROG inside
             She's sitting inside.
(vi) Temporal nominals
   Temporal nominals provide temporal information for the clause and thus tend to have co-
occurrence restrictions with the tense of the clause. Temporal nominals are found in the
corpus with only the locative and dative nominal case suffixes; for example ngurraramba-nî
`in the night' (night-LOC) and ngijininîma-nka `until tomorrow' (tomorrow-DAT).
(vii) Indefinite/interrogatives
   Cross-cutting this division of nominals is the subclass of indefinite/interrogatives. These
nominals can be used both as interrogatives (e.g. `who') and as indefinites (e.g. `someone').
There are indefinite/interrogative pronouns (e.g. gayini `who, someone/what, something'),
quantifiers (e.g. yangulany- `how many, some amount'), locationals (e.g. injani `where,
somewhere'), and temporals (e.g. yangulu `when, sometime'). Indefinite/interrogatives tend
to occur initially in the clause. These nominals are discussed in §4.7.","[66, 67, 68]"

7.2.7 VERBS WITH ALTERNATIONS IN TRANSITIVITY
   As is clear in the above discussion, it is not uncommon for verbs in Wambaya to have
both transitive and intransitive case frames, without the existence of formal marking
distinguishing the two. Such a situation has been claimed to be unusual among Australian
languages (e.g. Dixon 1980:378), although more recent work has shown it to be less unusual
than first thought. Evans (1995a:344) shows that a large number of Kayardild verbs may
appear in either transitive or intransitive case frames, pointing out that this is true also for
other accusative Australian languages such as Lardil and Martuthunira. Transitivity
alternations are also common among verbs in the non-Pama-Nyungan (ergative) languages of
the Kimberley (Bill McGregor, pers.comm). Thus, strict transitivity appears to be a property
of Pama-Nyungan ergative languages (e.g. Dyirbal (Dixon 1972), Diyari (Austin 1981a),
Ngiyambaa (Donaldson 1980)) rather than holding of Australian languages more generally.
   Two Wambaya verbs which show such transitivity alternations clearly are najbi `burn/
burn 0', and barndanyî `swear/swear at 0'. Najbi is a verb having what has been called a
`cognate subject' (Wilkins 1989), in that the semantics of the verb greatly restricts its possible
subjects. Such verbs constitute one restricted class of exceptions to the tendency for fixed
transitivity in many ergative (Pama-Nyungan) Australian languages (Evans 1995a: 344-345).
   Examples of these verbs in each case frame follow. Note that the transitivity of the verb is
shown both by the case marking of the subject NP (when present) and by the form of the third
person singular subject bound pronoun: gi- registers intransitive subjects and gini-/ngiyî- are
used with transitive subjects.

"
4   Another interesting aspect of the apical contrast is that speakers are less likely to correct me with regani
    to these sounds than they are with regard to other contrasts in the language. Thus, unless the distinction
    is crucial in distinguishing one word from another, I have found that speakers will tend to accept my
    pronunciation of a word regardless of whether I have a retroflex or an apico-alveolar consonant. The
    reason for this could simply be the increased tolerance of imperfection that there is for beginners in the
    language, or it could reflect a more interesting fact about the phonology of the language and the
    relationship between these two series of consonants. Unfortunately there is little more that can be said
    given my limited data and research in this area. Bill McGregor (pers.comm.) notes that in literacy writers
    of many languages also appear to be more tolerant of non-representation, or misrepresentation of
    retroflexion that of other contrasts, particularly when it is marked by means of a diacritic.
5   Butcher's (to appear) instrumental analysis of the pronunciation of initial apicals by speakers of a
    number of different Australian languages yields some interesting results. While his study supports the
    generally held acoustic impression that the two apical series are neutralised in initial position, he found
    that the apical sound which does occur is neither the apico-alveolar nor the retroflex version. Rather, he
    found that the phonetic realisation of the initial apicals is of a 'Mittelding' type — having an articulation
    somewhere between the unneutralised articulation of the two series (p.13). Thus, he found that initial
    apicals tended to be non-retroflex but have an articulation further back than the alveolar ridge, ""often on
    the borderline between alveolar and postalveolar zones"" (p.13). It is quite possible that this is also the
    case in Wambaya. However, without a detailed instrumental analysis it is impossible to tell.

   The distinction between the two apical nasals /n/ and Irn/ is neutralised before the retroflex
stop /rd/. In this environment it is always the retroflex nasal which is found. The distinction
between In/ and the lamino-palatal nasal /ny/ is similarly neutralised before the lamino-palatal
stop; in this position it is usually /ny/ that occurs. In contrast, the distinction between /n/ and
/ng/ is maintained before /g/. The one exception to this involves the dative suffix -nka which
can be heard as either [nga] or fugal .6
     The alveolar tap/trill /rr/ is usually a tap, but is a trill preconsonantally:

        /marrgulu/ egg      rmargulu]
   The retroflex approximant Id, rather than being grouped with the alveolar tap/trill under the
feature `rhotic', as is a common analysis for many Australian languages (e.g. see Dixon
1980:144-145), is considered to form a natural class with the semivowels /y/ and /w/ (as
reflected in Table 2.1). This analysis was prompted by a similar analysis given by McGregor
(1988b) for Gooniyandi and other languages in the north-west of Australia and is supported
by the following phonetic and phonotactic evidence which shows In to pattern like /y/ and /w/
and unlike /rr/.
(i) /r/, like the other semivowels, can be the result of lenition of stops in reduplication or
    preceding or following /g/. Thus, /b/ can be realised as /w/; /j/ as /y/; and /rd/ (written d
    initially) as /r/. Some examples are:
        wugbardi > wugwardi    cook
        junmi    > junmi-yunmi cut
        daguma > dagu-ragu-ma hit
        bardgu   > bargu       fall
      See §2.3.1 for a discussion of lenition and §2.3.6 for a discussion of reduplication.
(ii) /r/, like /y/ and /w/, can be elided between two identical vowels, creating a long vowel:
        manka-waji > mankaajî            deaf
        iriyiliji  > iriiliji            father
        baraj-bulu > baaj-bulu           old person-DU
       See §2.1.4 for a discussion of long vowels.
(iii) /r/, like /y/ and /w/ but unlike /rr/, can never be the initial element in a consonant cluster.
       See §2.2.3 for a discussion of consonant clusters.
   McGregor argues that in Gooniyandi the alveolar tap /rr/ forms a natural class with the
laterals, defined by the feature [liquid] (although distinguished by the feature [lateral])
(1988b:166, 169-171). There is some evidence to suggest that this may also be a possible
analysis for Wambaya:6      Hale (1959:i) gives -nka as the Wambaya dative suffix, and -ngga as the Gudanji version. In my corpus.
       the two appear as variants of each other, without any obvious dialectal difference.
                                                                            Phonetics and phonology       21(i) /rr/, /rl/ and /1/ behave as a class, being the only sounds that can precede /w/ in a
    consonant cluster (the other lateral /ly/ does not occur in consonant clusters).
(ii) /rl/ and /rr/ are similar in that they both appear to condition lenition from /b/ to /w/ in the
     verbal unmarked suffix -bî and the infinitive suffix -barda. See §6.1 for a discussion of
     verbal inflection.
      garran-bi      stand    BUT          ngîrr-wî          growl
      ngaj-barda     see-INF BUT           ngarl-warda       talk-INF
    Note that there are no verb roots that end with either of the other laterals: /1/ or Ay/.
   However, these two arguments alone are not adequately convincing to support postulating
a natural class containing the laterals and Irr/. Thus, I assume that /rr/ is in a class of its own,
defined as a non-nasal, non-lateral sonorant.7
2.1.2 VOWELS
   There is quite a wide range of allophonic variation among the three vowels in Wambaya.8
The major vowel allophones tend to be slightly central and become more so in unstressed
syllables. Vowels are fronted before palatal consonants and are often lowered or produced
with a more back articulation when next to the labio-velar approximant /w/. The various
allophones for each vowel phoneme and their environments are listed below:
      /a/ has the allophone [œ] I [j, p]_[j] e.g. /jayili/ `down': rj ejtli]
                                [ai] /_[J, p, X, j] e.g. /danya/ `clothes': Cdaina]
                                [>al / [w]_[m] e.g. /wamba/ `snappy gum': ['w>amba]9
                                /_[w]                  e.g. /barrawu/ `house': ['bar>awù]
                                [a] elsewhere          e.g. /baba/ `elder brother': ['baba]
7   Gavan Breen (pers.comm.) claims that /rr/ is in fact closely related to Id/ (McGregor I988b also provides
    evidence for a (historical) relationship between /d/ and /rr/ in other languages of northern Australia).
    Breen points out that /rr/ and /d/ contrast only in Wambaya when they occur intervocalically after a
    primary stressed vowel (and perhaps also as the initial member of a consonant cluster), but elsewhere
    seem to be in complementary distribution. Thus, /d/ is found word-initially and as the second member of
    a consonant cluster, while /rr/ occurs intervocalically after a non-primary stressed vowel. Although there
    are a few exceptions to this distribution, most of them can be attributed to factors such as dissimilation
    and morphological structure. However, as distributional evidence is not enough to he indicative of a
    natural class (Juliette Blevins, pers.comm.), this does not affect my treatment of /rr/ discussed above.
8   The long vowels /aa/ and /ii/ are very unusual and are exemplified below and then discussed in more
    detail in §2.1.4.
    In the language name, the phonetic realisation of the first /a/ is closer to [a I than [>a l:
        /wambaya/ 'Wambaya' ['womba'jal
22    Chapter 2
      Ii/ has the allophone [i] / _ [j], # e.g. /niyinama/ `female skin name': [ni jtnama]
                                                      e.g. /ngajbi/ `see': rr)aijbi]
                                   [>i] I_ [w]    e.g. /maliwa/ `big' (Iv): ['mal>iwa]
                                   [t] elsewhere e.g. /ngijini/ `yesterday' : rtjttt.ni]10
      /u/ has the allophone [u'] / [j, j, p, X] e.g./lujuluju/ 'coolamon': r'luiju'luiju]
                                                           e.g. /guyala/ `nothing': [1kuijala]
                                   [û] / [w] _             e.g. /mawula/ `play': r'm>awûla]
                                   [u] elsewhere           eg /jugu/ `MB' : rjugu]
   Vowels can also be slightly rhoticised before a retroflex consonant. This is especially true
of the low central vowel /a/.
   In a small number of words a long vowel [a:] is found, and a couple of words have the
long vowel [i:]. Such long vowels always carry primary stress. There are no examples of
minimal pairs in which these long vowels contrast with the corresponding short vowels.
These vowels are written aa and iî respectively. Some examples are:
      jaabi          Cja:bi]      wart
      bruraala       [ba'ra:la] bird sp.
      Nganaara       [ija'na:ra] Brunette Downs Station
      ngirnîî        [genii]      south
      burriiji       [bu'ri:3i] bird sp.
   The small number of examples of these vowels, and the absence of minimal pairs in which
they contrast with the corresponding short vowels, suggests that they are not an original part
of the Wambaya phonemic system. These vowels may have derived from an original
sequence of vowel—semivowel—vowel, from which the semivowel was dropped (in fact this
is known to be the case for ngirnii; see below). These vowels are discussed further in §2.1.4.","[37, 38, 39, 40]"
"
18 When the auxiliary is monosyllabic it encliticises to the preceding constituent, forming a single
    phonological word. When it is polysyllabic, it forms its own stress domain — see §2.2.4.
154     Chapter 5
   A topicalised NP, however, does not count as a constituent of the basic clause for the
purposes of auxiliary placement; in this case, the auxiliary appears in third position.l 9
     (5-85)     Gujiga-nka manganyma ngi-n                    wugbardi.

                Wirrilgarra ran behind (him).
   While the usual position of the auxiliary is following the initial constituent, there are a
small number of examples in which the auxiliary is found in first position. In all of these
examples, the clause with the initial auxiliary is closely linked with the preceding clause in the
discourse context; it may be co-ordinated (example (5-88)), or make an addition or correction
to the earlier clause (5-89). Thus, in these examples it is the final constituent of the first
clause which serves as the host for the auxiliary.

                As a young woman I used to go hunting, this old woman and I used to go
                (hunting).
   The auxiliary is usually obligatory in every finite clause, both main and subordinate. Non-
finite subordinate clauses and verbless clauses do not contain an auxiliary:
     (5-90)     Alîyulu ng-a         alaji    gulug-barda (*gi).

7.2.5.2 TRANSITIVE VERBS WITH COGNATE OBJECTS
   The transitive verbs nijbi `sing o' and ngarlu `dance O' can occur only with a single type
of object: namely one referring to a song and a dance, respectively. Such objects are usually
referred to as cognate objects (e.g. Austin 1982).
   (7-87)   Juwa-ni      gini-n             nijbi jawala.
            man.I-LOC 3SG.M.A(PR)-PROG sing name.of.ceremony(ACC)
            The man is singing the jawala ceremony.

              dance IPLEXC.A-HAB.PST corroboree.IV(ACC)
              We used to dance corroborees.
  Nijbi can also be used intransitively; see §7.2.7.
   Other verbs in the corpus also take cognate objects. These include ngarlwî `speak
(language)'; which differs from ngarlu and nijbi in taking a nominative subject despite the
presence of the object (see §7.2.2.4), and didima `tell O (story) to I0' which is exemplified in
the discussion of ditransitive verbs below.","[206, 207]"

   My greatest debt is to the Wambaya people who welcomed me into their community and
taught me, so patiently, what I know of their language. In particular I would like to thank my
friends and language teachers, Molly Nurlanyma Grueman, Minnie Niyamarrama Nimara,
Mavis Bangarinya Hogan and Powder Bangarinji O'Keefe (Gudanji) for their never-ending
cooperation, tolerance and patience. They cheerfully shared with me their language and their
stories, answered my questions, and corrected my mistakes. For their support and friendship
I would also like to thank many other people from Elliott and Tennant Creek, including:
Florine Bathern, Ivy Duncan, Amy and Jeffrey Dixon, Billy Hayes, Sandra Hogan, Judy
Holt, Ian Hopwood, Michael Neade, Penny Watson, Heather Wilson and Oscar Wilson; all
of the people who participated in the Wambaya literacy workshop in Tennant Creek in April
1993; and, especially, Moana Strauss for generously sharing her flat and car during my
months of fieldwork. The Gurungu Council in Elliott, who initiated this project, helped
enormously in obtaining funding for my visits and was always cooperative, as was the
Papulu Apparr-kari language centre in Tennant Creek.
   A very special thanks goes to. Nick Evans, who was a dedicated and enthusiastic MA
supervisor, and who first got me interested in working on Australian languages. Without his
invaluable advice, support and encouragement this project might never have got off the
ground. Robert Hoogenraad provided general encouragement and help in the field and I was
also fortunate enough to spend some time in the field with Luise Hercus, David Nash and
Gavan Breen, whose kind support and advice were most appreciated. Many thanks are due
also to John Henderson and Robert Hoogenraad, who provided much-needed computer
assistance. For insightful comments on various aspects of this grammar I am indebted to
Peter Austin, Juliette Blevins, Joan Bresnan, Margaret Carew, Ian Green, John Hajek and
Lesley Stirling. In particular, my revisions to this grammar have benefited enormously from
the comments and suggestions of my two MA examiners, Bill McGregor and Jane Simpson.
Of course, none of these people can be held responsible for any of the remaining flaws or
inadequacies.
   This project would not have been possible without the financial support of the Australian
Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies grant L91/4100, and the Australian
Research Council grant A58930745 (awarded to Nick Evans) entitled 'Non-Pama-Nyungan
languages of Northern Australia: descriptive, grammatical, comparative and sociolinguistic
investigations'. Funding for an additional field trip in 1994 was provided by the Centre for
the Study of Language and Information at Stanford University, with the help of Peter Sells
and Stanley Peters. I thank all these people and organisations for their generous support.
   My heartfelt thanks go to Dean Robinson, who stood by me throughout this project and
put up with my many moods and absences. My family and friends also provided much
valued support and encouragement. I thank them all for their patience and understanding.

2.2.1 SYLLABLE STRUCTURE
   The following syllable types are found in Wambaya. Types (i) and (ii) can occur only
word-initially and types (iv) and (v) do not occur word-finally. Type (iii) is the most common
syllable type and the only one that is unrestricted in its occurrence.
        (i)     V      e.g. a.ya.nî             look for
        (ii)    VC     e.g. ang.ba.rdi          build
       (iii)    Cv     e.g. ya.rru              go
       (iv)     CVC e.g. garr.ga.lyi            plains lizard
        (v)     CVCC e.g. lurrg.ba.nyi grab, snatch
    Type (v) is highly restricted and is possible only when, as in lurrgbanyi, it is part of the
tri-consonantal cluster /rrgb/. This cluster is further exemplified in §2.2.3.
   As well as constraints on the word position of different syllable types (mentioned above),
there are different constraints on the onset of a syllable depending on its position within the
word. Thus, while the syllable onset13 that follows an open syllable (e.g. cv.cv(C)(C)) can
be any consonant, that which follows a closed syllable (e.g. Cvc.cv(c)(c)), or which occurs
word-initially (CV(C)(C).CV...) is restricted as to the type of consonant that can occur. There
are also restrictions on the possible coda of a syllable (e.g. VC. CVC), depending on the
consonant that follows it (i.e. the onset of the following syllable). For this reason, word-
initial consonants (CV(C)(C).CV...) and consonant clusters ((C)VC.CV...) are discussed
separately, in §2.2.2 and §2.2.3 respectively.
   However, there are some general things that can be said here about the nature of onsets
and codas.l 4 The frequency of occurrence for groups of segments as either onsets or codas in
Wambaya is largely predicted by the continuum of active articulators proposed by Hamilton
(1992, 1995) as a tool for describing the phonotactic constraints in Australian languages:15
        LABIAL DORSAL LAMINAL APICAL
 3 I am assuming the internal structure of a syllable to consist of an onset and a rhyme. which in turn is
      divided into a nucleus and a coda (as argued for in Blevins 1995, for example).
14 It should be noted here that this discussion is concerned only with onsets that belong to either initial
      syllables, or syllables following a closed syllable. It is not concerned with syllable onsets that follow an
      open syllable (i.e. those that occur intervocalically), as these are unrestricted.
15 In fact, there is little support for the distinction between labials and dorsals implied by this continuum
      (Juliette Blevins, pers.comm.).
                                                                             Phonetics and phonology       27   The prediction is that permissible syllable onsets in any given Australian language will
form a continuum of both frequency and possibility beginning from the left side, while
permissible syllable codas form such a continuum beginning on the right side. Thus,
according to this continuum, labials are more preferred as onsets than laminais and apicals,
but are less preferred as codas (which are preferably apicals). Furthermore, if a language
allows laminal onsets then it will allow dorsal and labial onsets; if it allows dorsal codas then
it will allow laminal and apical codas, and so on.
    As will be seen in the ensuing discussion of word-initial segments and consonant clusters
in Wambaya, the frequency of occurrence of segments as syllable onsets conforms to this
continuum. Thus, although the constraints differ depending on the position of the syllable in
the word, syllable onsets are most commonly peripherals (labials and dorsals). This
preference is particularly striking for onsets following a closed syllable (i.e. onsets that are
the second element in a consonant cluster; see §2.2.3). Furthermore, the most highly
restricted onsets, those which can occur only intervocalically, are either apical or laminal: /rr/,
/r/, /ly/.
    The case of codas in Wambaya is less striking, although it does not contradict the
predictions made by Hamilton. Of the five consonants that can occur finally in the auxiliary
(/rr/, /rl/, /n/, /ny/, /ngf), three are apical, one laminal and one dorsal. Although all types of
sounds are found as the coda of non-final syllables, labials in this position are severely
restricted (occurring only in one homorganic nasal—stop cluster, which clusters are excluded
in Hamilton's discussion) as, to a slightly lesser extent, are dorsals. Apicals, on the other
hand, are the least restricted and clearly the most preferred in this position.
   More specific details of onset and coda constraints, and their relationship to both
Hamilton's continuum and the sonority hierarchy, will be discussed in §2.2.2 and §2.2.3
below.","[44, 45]"

18 It is common in Australian linguistics to use the term `peripheral' to refer to labials and dorsals and
      `non-peripheral' to refer to laminais and apicals. Thus, the term `peripheral' corresponds with the more
      generally familiar term 'non-coronal'. (Note that `non-coronal' usually includes (dorso-)palatals as well.
      However, as palatals in Australian languages are usually laminal, they involve raising the blade of the
      tongue from its neutral position and are therefore coronal.)
                                                                     Phonetics and phonology    29      LABIAL DORSAL LAMINAL APICAL
   The claim is that the permissable onsets of a language will form a continuum beginning
from the left side: labial and dorsal consonants are the most preferred syllable onsets,
followed by laminal consonants and apical consonants, which are the least preferred. The
strong preference for word-initial peripherals in Wambaya thus corresponds with the
predictions of this continuum.
   While words with initial high vowels are analysed as having an underlying initial
semivowel (as discussed above), it is still possible in Wambaya for a vowel phoneme to
occur in word-initial position: the phoneme /a/. It is possible that all of the /a/-initial words in
Wambaya result from the dropping of an original initial semivowel, /w/. In some cases the
two forms still exist in free variation. For example, the word meaning `to find' can be heard
pronounced either waliyulu or alîyulu. In other cases, evidence of this initial /w/ comes from
its presence in a cognate form from another dialect. Thus, alima meaning `well, OK,
goodbye' is walima in Gudanji. Some other examples of Wambaya words with initial /a/

7.4.2 SECONDARY PREDICATES
   An ascriptive NP can function as a secondary predicate (Nichols 1978) for the subject or
object of a finite clause, in which case, like all nominal modifiers, it must agree in case and
gender (and presumably number, although there are no relevant examples) with the nominal it
modifies. This secondary predicate provides information about the manner or state of the
argument during the time of the main predicate. Theoretically, since these secondary
predicates are adjuncts, any nominal could se rve as a secondary predicate co-occurring with
any verb. Examples of secondary predication follow.

          sick.one.II(ACC) 3SG.M.A-10-NF-PROG look.after
          He looks after me, the sick one.
   In the following example, the secondary predicate (bugayirna ngabulungunya) is in the
nominative case, even though the clause is transitive and the subject is registered with a
transitive subject bound pronoun (and must, therefore, have ergative/locative case). This is
presumably because ergative NPs do not take ergative/locative case marking when fronted
(see §4.4.3).
  (7-133) Bugayirna ngabulu-ngunya, yagu ng-a                   ngarri
          big.Il(NOM) breast-PROP.II(NOM) leave 1 SG.A-PST I SG.POSS.I(ACC)
          irda.
          father.I(ACC)
          (When I was) grown up, having breasts, I left my father.
    True secondary predicates, such as those above, are characterised by the fact that the
clause can be seen as the conjunction of two separate predications: one without the secondary
predicate, and the other a nominal clause with the secondary predicate as the nominal
predicate. For example, (7-126) consists of the two propositions Gulugbi ga `She slept' and
Ilijbirna (nagarna) `(She) was alone'. Such constructions can thus be distinguished from the
syntactically similar use of (usually body-part) NPS in constructions of inalienable
possession. Consider the following examples:
  (7-134) Bagijbi ngi-n               juruma.
          feel.bad I SG.S(PR)-PROG stomach.iV(NOM)
          I feel sick in the stomach.
   (7-135) Warima gini-ng-a       labirra.
           hold     3SG.M.A-10-NF hand.IV(ACC)
           He held my hand.
  The modifying NP in these examples, like those functioning as secondary predicates, must
agree with the head noun in case. However, unlike example (7-126), (7-134) is not an
                                                                      Syntax of simple sentences   197example of a true secondary predicate construction since an attempt to decompose it into two
propositions would give Bagijbi ngin 'I feel sick' and the non-sensical (Ngawurniji) juruma
`I am a stomach'. A further difference between the two constructions in Wambaya is that,
while the modifying NP in secondary predicate constructions must agree with the head noun
in gender and number as well as case, this is not true for examples such as (7-134) and (7-
135) above. For example, the subject in (7-134) (taken from Text 4 in Appendix A) has
masculine gender, while the nominal juruma `stomach' has vegetable gender. Therefore,
following Evans (1995a), I distinguish between true secondary predicate constructions and
subject/object-construed body-part constructions such as those in (7-134) and (7-135)
respectively.
   A small number of verbs subcategorise for secondary predicates on the subject, in which
case the modifying NP is referred to as a subject complement. Verbs requiring subject
complements were discussed in §7.2. For convenience, one example of the reflexive verb
manku `to feel', which subcategorises for a subject complement expressing the emotion
attributed to the subject, is repeated here.
  (7-136) Manku ngi-ngg-a      baginga.

   Auxiliaries with objects contain the same subject bound pronouns and tense suffixes as in
the charts above (Wambaya is the only member of the Eastern Group that has a different
system of tense marking in these auxiliaries than in auxiliaries without objects; see §5.2.1).
In all languages/dialects third person object is not overtly expressed in the auxiliary and object
bound pronouns register person only. The object bound pronouns in all languages/ dialects
are: ng(V) `first person object' and ny(V) `second person object'.
   The only significant difference among auxiliaries with objects in the Eastern Group
languages is in the ordering of object bound pronouns and tense suffixes. The usual order is
subject-object-tense:
      ngi-ny-a        ISG.A-20-NF (W)
      ngî-nya-ma      1SG.A-20-PST (G)
      ngi-ny-ani      I SG.A-20-PST (B)
      ngi-ny-a        I SG.A-20-PST (Ng)
but in Binbinka the order is subject—tense—object in the future tense:
      ny-urla-nga     2SG.A-FUT-20 (B)
and tense—subject—object in the present tense:
      ya-ngî-nya      PR-ISG.A-20 (B)

reflexive/reciprocal pronouns given in Chadwick (1978), along with the _ Wambaya
equivalents.

the Jaminjung past tense form of the verb `go': gany (Cleverly 1968). Also, the Ngarnga
habitual past tense suffix (-agbangî) and the Wambaya `hypothetical' (irrealis) suffix
(-agba)5 may be related to the Ngaliwuru preterite form of the verb 'be', gagba (Bolt,
Hoddinott and Kofod 197la), or the Jaminjung verb form gagba meaning 'he was' (Cleverly
1968).6 Similarly, as Ian Green (1995:419) notes, the Wambaya habitual past suffix is
probably derived from yadj, the irrealis form of the Jaminjung auxiliary verb `be'.7
    Note that there is some alternation among the initial vowels of these suffixes when they appear with
    certain subject bound pronouns.
3   Chadwick calls this and the following suffix 'irrealis present' and 'irrealis past' respectively.
4   Chadwick calls this suffix 'irrealis future'.
5   It is not uncommon for habitual and irrealis categories to be formally related in northern Australian
    languages (R. Green 1995).
6   I am indebted to Nick Evans for these observations.

   This list contains all of the open-class lexical items included in the most recent version of
the Wambaya dictionary, a long-term project currently in progress. In the interests of saving
space I have omitted all of the closed-class items, such as the demonstratives (§4.6), the
pronouns (§4.8), the clitics (§7.7.1), the auxiliaries (Chapter 5) and the skin names
(§1.2.3), all of which are discussed in detail in the grammar. While this is essentially a
Wambaya wordlist, I have included words from other languages/dialects that Wambaya
people commonly use. In addition, since the Wambaya and Gudanji communities are so
closely connected and the dialects so mixed in many people's speech, any Gudanji words
that have been collected are included here, even those that are not usually used by Wambaya
speakers. Whenever the source dialect of a word is known it has been provided in the entry.
However, it is highly likely that there are many Gudanji words included here that have not
yet been identified as such. Lexical items derived by many of the productive derivational
processes discussed in this grammar are included here, although this list is certainly not
exhaustive in this respect. The internal morphological structure of these words is provided
using underlying forms of the morphemes (e.g. gurinymi (gurij-mi `good-FAC')). When
the underlying form of the root is not known, the citation form is used (e.g. dabudabunymi
(dabudaburri-mi `weak-FAC')).
   The entries in this wordlist are structured as follows (note that not all of the following
information is included in, or relevant to, all entries):
headword [phonetic], also (variant) ?also (alternative transcription), part of speech,
  (Noun class; root-suffix `gloss'; dialect information; other grammatical information.)
  1. most common meaning; 2. part of speech second sense, etc. [Scientific name]

1.1.1 THE WEST BARKLY LANGUAGES
   The West Barkly language family consists of 5 languages/dialects: Jingili, Ngarnga (or
Ngarnji), Wambaya, Gudanji and Binbinka. The structure of this family can be represented
as in Table 1.1 (following Chadwick 1978:2).
                      TABLE 1.1: THE WEST BARKLY LANGUAGE FAMILY                    West Barkly Language Family
                             Jingili        Eastern Groups
                                            Ngarnga        McArthur Language
                                                Wambaya Gudanji Binbinka
3   Although the Tangkic languages were originally classified by O'Grady, Voegelin and Voegelin (1966) as
    Pama-Nyungan, recent discussions (namely Evans (1985, 1988, 1995a) and Blake (1988, 1990)) have
    shown them to be clearly non-Pama-Nyungan.
4
    These gender suffixes are then followed by the appropriate case suffix.
5
    The terms 'Eastern Group' and 'McArthur' are taken from Chadwick (e.g. 1978).
                                                                             The language and its speakers     3   Thus, the language family contains two groups: Jingili an d the Eastern Group. The
Eastern Group contains four languages/dialects of which three — Wambaya, Gudanji and
Binbinka — are clearly dialects of the one language. Lexicostatistical data (discussed below)
show Ngarnga to be quite closely related to these three dialects, but different enough to be
probably best considered a language of its own.6 Thus, the Eastern Group is made up of two
languages: Ngamga and the `McArthur language'7 which has the three dialects Wambaya,
Gudanji and Binbinka.
    Chadwick (1978:320, 322) provides a lexicostatistical comparison of the members of the
West Barkly language group based on a 100-item word list. His results are given in Table 1.2
(I have collapsed his two tables into one).

                        LANGUAGES (BASED ON 100-ITEM WORD LIST)                                   Jingili      Ngarnga       Wambaya          Gudanji

   Thus, Jingili has a fairly low level of shared vocabulary with all of the Eastern Group
languages/dialects and is quite clearly a language of a different subgroup. On the other hand,
the languages/dialects of the Eastern Group have quite high levels of shared vocabulary,
although the dialects of the McArthur language share more vocabulary with each other
(between 69% and 88%) than any of them do with Ngarnga (between 60% and 62%).
However, the levels of shared vocabulary with Ngarnga are still substantial and suggest a
close relationship with the dialects of the McArthur language. The three dialects of the
McArthur language form a dialect chain: Wambaya shares a high percentage of vocabulary
with Gudanji which shares a high percentage of vocabulary with Binbinka. The percentage of
shared vocabulary between Wambaya and Binbinka, however, is significantly less. This
pattern is predictable from the (traditional) geographic positions of the three communities:
Wambaya country shares its northern border with Gudanji country which shares its northern
border with Binbinka country (see Map 2).
   The main focus of this description is the Wambaya dialect of the McArthur language.
Unfortunately it was not possible to investigate the other Eastern Group languages/dialects in
the sane amount of detail that I have for Wambaya. This is due not only to time constraints
but also to difficulty in finding informants: I have only been able to find one speaker of
Ngarnga and only one partial speaker of Binbinka. However, what information I have on
these other languages (particularly Gudanji, smatterings of which are found in the speech of
6   There has been a fair amount of variation in the literature as to the classification of Ngarnga with respect
    to the other West Barkly languages. Capell (1979:182) considers it to be very close to Jingili, related
    ~practically at dialect level"". Tindale (1974), on the other hand, gives `Ngandji' (Ngarnji/Ngarnga) as an
    alternati ve name for the `Kotandji' (Gudanji) people, thereby suggesting that Ngarnga is very closely
    related to dialects of the McArthur language. Chadwick (1971:34) describes Ngarnga as ""a `halfway' in
    linguistic content between Djingili in the west and the Wambaja-Gudandj.i group in the east..."" which is
    a more accurate claim although, as shown in Table 1.1, Ngamga is closer in relationship to the
    McArthur dialects than it is to Jingili.

    status.

most Wambaya speakers) is included in the discussion wherever possible.8 A discussion of
Jingili is outside the scope of this work as it is substantially different from the other
languages and is also the language which Chadwick has worked on in the most detail (see
Chadwick 1975). Jingili will be referred to only for comparative discussion.","[20, 21, 22]"

1    Wambaya is alone among the McArthur dialects in inflecting the verb for tense: in neither Gudanji nor
     Binbinka is the verb inflected in main clauses (Chadwick 1978:84). In Ngarnga, the verb also shows a
     future/non-future contrast: however, interestingly, the basic verb form (i.e. that which corresponds to the
     non-future verb form in Wambaya) is used in the future tense, while verbs in past and present tenses are
     inflected with the suffix -ani (p.85).
2    The thematic      of 7 Class verbs also appears before derivational suffixes such as -barli- 'AGNT' and
     -baja- 'PRIV'. For example:
         dag    j-moi hit-TH-AGNT (I)
         daguma j-baji     hit-TH-PRIV (I)
3.   The non-future tense form of a verb is also the citation form, and thus is more like a general unmarked
     form (see below).
                                                     157
158    Chapter 6   Note that the three nominal suffixes -ni, -nka and -nnga are preceded here with /i/. This is
an epenthetic vowel which occurs between the final consonant of a verb stem (whether this
consonant is the final consonant of the root itself, or the thematic consonant /j/) and a
following suffix with an initial nasal. The epenthetic vowel breaks up what would otherwise
be an impossible consonant cluster. (A nasal can be the second element of a consonant cluster
only when it is preceded by a hetero-organic nasal; see §2.2.3). When the details of verbal
morphological structure are not significant I will not segment this epenthetic vowel in
examples in this work, but will group it with the preceding morpheme. For example:
      daguma ji-nka     hit-TH-DAT (NOT daguma j-î-nka )
      ngarli-nka        talk-DAT    (NOT ngarl-i-nka)
   Some examples of inflected verbs from each class are given in Table 6.2. Due to lack of
space, the inflection of only one of the nominal suffixes (-nka) is exemplified. Irregular verbs
are given in Table 6.4 below. In all of the following tables an underline indicates that the
corresponding form is not present in the corpus.

   *Note that the final consonant of this root is dropped before an inflection with initial /b/. I
have no explanation for this as /gb/ is a permissible consonant cluster in Wambaya (e.g.
gulugbi `sleep'). See §2.2.3 for a discussion of consonant clusters in Wambaya.
   As can be seen in Table 6.2, membership of the two conjugation classes is phonologically
determined: verbs with vowel-final roots belong to the J Class and those with consonant-final
roots belong to the 0 Class.
                                                                                   Verbs    159   An alternative analysis for the verbs of the J Class would be to consider the /j/ as in fact
belonging to the verb root, rather than being thematic. Under this analysis the non-future
suffix would still be -0, but the final consonant of the root would be dropped according to
the general phonotactic constraint that words in Wambaya be vowel-final (see §2.2).
However, if the roots of J Class verbs contain a final /j/, then there is no obvious explanation
as to why these verbs belong to a different class than other verbs, such as ngaj- `see', which
also have fj/-final roots. Under the `thematic /jr analysis however, this inconsistency is
avoided as the roots of these two verbs are different: one (daguma-) is vowel-final and the
other (ngaj-) is consonant-final.
  There is some evidence, however, to suggest that /j/ may once have been part of the verbal
root, or even part of the non-future inflection, -bi. For example, many of the verbs of the J
Class have cognates in other languages/dialects of the Eastern. Group that have final
jbi in the non-future fornt4

   One of the particularly interesting things about the Wambaya verbal inflections is their
striking similarity to some of the verbal inflections in Garrwa, a language which borders
Wambaya but appears otherwise unrelated to it. According to the analysis of Garrwa verbs
proposed by Belfrage (1992:46), Garrwa has five verbal conjugation classes. Of these five
there are two which show substantial similarity to the two Wambaya classes and are also
referred to by Belfrage as the J conjugation class and the 0 conjugation class. Table 6.3 gives
the forms of the inflections for these two Garrwa verbal conjugation classes.
    TABLE 6.3: GARRWA J AND 0 CONJUGATION CLASSES (FROM BELFRAGE 1992:46)                                            J              0

                        Sequential          -jiwa          -(bi)jîwa

                        Infinitive          -(j)kanyi      -(bi)kanyi
   Thus, Class J verbs in Garrwa have the same /jb/ sequence in their unmarked form that is
so distinctive to verbs in Wambaya. Furthermore, the unmarked inflections of these two
classes in Garrwa are identical to the future tense inflections that occur in the respective
Wambaya classes. And the Wambaya non-future inflection, -bi, turns up (optionally) before4   The Ngamga information is taken from Chadwick (1971). The Gudanji information is from my own
    field notes.
160    Chapter 6the other inflections of the 0 Class in Garrwa. Another point of comparsion is the Garrwa
`same subject' inflection which is very similar in form to the `same subject' inflection (i.e. the
ergative/locative case) in the J Class in Wambaya: j-ini. This inflection in Wambaya is used
to mark same subject in non-finite clauses that are simultaneous with the main clause (see
§8.1). In Wambaya this inflection is analysed as consisting of the thematic consonant r/,
followed by the epenthetic vowel /i/ and then the ergative/locative case inflection -ni. The
Garrwa inflection also appears to be based on the locative inflection, which is -na in Garrwa
(Belfrage 1992:13). Although it is not unusual for the locative case inflection to be used to
mark same subject in this region (see Austin 1981b), it is interesting here that the two
inflections both precede the locative suffix with the sequence /ji/. In Garrwa however, unlike
Wambaya, the full form -jina is also used with the 0 Class. In Wambaya the form that occurs
with the 0 Class is -ini. There is clearly need for more detailed comparative work between
these two languages.
   There are a number of irregular Wambaya verbs which do not belong to either of the two
conjugation classes discussed here. Table 6.4 gives the forms of such verbs that are present
in the corpus, along with the regular verbs daguma `hit' and ngajbi `see' for comparison
(non-italicised). A question mark indicates that the form given is hypothesised, but not
confirmed.

gajurru and nanganangali have irregular infinitive forms and gajurru, along with ganjimi, has
an irregular future tense form. The remaining five verbs are irregular in that they do not
distinguish future and non-future tense. Furthermore, verbs such as yarru and gannga have
alternative infinitive and/or DAT forms, one of which contains the corresponding regular J
Class inflection. Yugu takes the 0 Class infinitive inflection but the J Class DAT inflection.

6.1 INFLECTIONAL MORPHOLOGY
6.1.1 NON-FUTURE INFLECTION
   As discussed above, the non-future suffix is either -0 (with vowel-final stems) or -bi
(with consonant-final stems). The non-future form of the verb is also the citation form of the
verb and thus may in fact be better considered as the unmarked form. The non-future
inflection is used in both past and present tenses and can also be used in the immediate future
tense (examples (6-1) and (6-2)) in which case it is accompanied by future tense marking in
the auxiliary. This is one case in which there is a mismatch between the tense marking in the
auxiliary and that on the verb.5

            go(FUT) SG.IMP.TWD this.way THEN 1DU.INC.S-FUT talk-NF
            Come here so that we can talk!
  The non-future form of the verb can also be found in some imperative constructions:
  (6-3)     Alyu nyi-ng-a                  daguma-0!
            NEG.IMP 2SG:A-IO-NF            hit-NF

  (6-4)     Bard-bi garna!
            run-NF SG:IMP.AWY
            Run over there!
  Imperative constructions are discussed in more detail in §6.1.2.
   Its appearance in some future and imperative constructions as well as the fact that it is
always the citation form of the verb suggests that the non-future form is really more like an
unmarked verb form. Therefore, I will treat it as unmarked in example sentences elsewhere in
this work:
     dagunta      hit    (not 'hit(NF)')
     ngajbi      see (not ngaj-bi `see-NF')
6.1.2 FUTURE INFLECTION
   The future tense suffix is -ba, or -wa after liquids. As well as being used in future tense
clauses (examples (6-5) and (6-6)), the future tense suffix also marks imperative mood ((6-7)
and (6-8)). While they contain the same verbal inflection, an imperative construction is
distinguished from a future tense construction since the auxiliary in an imperative
    See Table 6.5 for the possible combinations of verbal and auxiliary tense categories.
162     Chapter 6
construction usually carnes non-future tense marking (6-7) while in a future tense
construction it carries future tense marking (6-5). (See §5.5 for a discussion of the auxiliary
in imperative constructions and Table 6.5 for the interaction between auxiliary and verbal
tense categories). Recall that a future tense construction, such as in example (6-5), can have a
polite imperative reading (see §5.5 for more examples).

              talk-FUT mother.II-DAT
              Talk to your mother!
   In two types of imperative constructions — negative imperative constructions and
constructions containing imperative directional suffixes — it is possible for the verb to appear
without future tense marking. Examples include (6-3) and (6-4) above, and the following:
    (6-9)     A lyu     junmi/junmi-j-ba!
              NEG.IMP cut(NF)/Cut-TH-FUT
              Don't cut it!
    (6-10) Alyu      nyi-ng-a   daguma/daguma j-ba!
           NEG.IMP 2SG.A-IO-NF hit(NF)/hit-TH-FUT
           Don't hit me!
    (6-11)    Wugbardi gama!      OR Wugbardi -j-ba gama!
              cook(NF) SG.IMP.AWY    cook-TH-FUT
              Go and cook it!
    (6-12)    Gaj-bi girrama!   OR Gaj-ba girrama!
              eat-NF PL.IMP.TWD    eat-FUT
              Come and eat!
   The absence of future tense marking in these constructions can probably be accounted for
by the fact that the negative particle and the directional suffixes are specifically imperative.
Thus, with their presence the clause is already marked as imperative, rendering it unnecessary
for this to be also indicated on the verb.
   Verbs such as yarru `go' and yabu `take, have', which do not distinguish future and non-
future tense (see Table 6.4 above), always co-occur with directional suffixes in the imperative
mood. As these directional suffixes are inherently imperative, it is thus possible to make a
distinction between imperative clauses and future tense clauses with these verbs.6
6     Note that, as these verbs make no distinction between future and non-future tenses, the glossing of them
      as `FUT' in these examples is, to a certain extent, arbitrary.

   The fact that these verbs often occur with directional suffixes, which themselves mark
imperative mood and tense (in indicative clauses), may explain why it is that they are not
overtly inflected for tense themselves; we have already seen examples in which the verbal
inflection is omitted when it co-occurs with directional suffixes (examples (6-11) and (6-12)
above). However, even in clauses without directional suffixes, these verbs are not overtly
inflected for future tense:
  (6-17)    Yarru       ng-u   marndijî.
            go(FUT) 1 SG.S-FUT later
            I'll go later.

            have(FUT) 2SG.A-FUT many.I(ACC) boy.I(ACC)
            You'll have lots of kids.
   The future tense inflection is used both in imperative constructions (as discussed above)
and in future tense constructions (examples (6-5) and (6-6)). In clauses with immediate future
tense however, and in negative future tense clauses, the verb occurs in the non-future form.
For examples of clauses with immediate future tense see (6-1) and (6-2). Some examples of
future tense negative clauses follow.
  (6-19)    Yangula irr-agba        jiyawu.
            NEG       3PLA-HYP give(NF)
            They will not give it to him.

            NEG         tSG.A-HYP drink-NF tomorrow
            I will not drink tomorrow.
   Table 6.5 shows the possible combinations of auxiliary and verbal tense categories.?
Recall that the tense categories of the auxiliary differ depending on the number of the subject
bound pronoun and the presence/absence of an object bound pronoun (§5.2.1). Thus, some
auxiliaries will collapse some of the distinctions made in this table. Note also that some of
these marking patte rns are optional; that is auxiliaries in imperative constructions can actually
have no tense marking at all (see §5.5).","[175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181]"
"    Note that all tense/aspect/mood suffixes with initial /u/ trigger regressive vowel harmony in minimal
    subject bound pronouns. For a full discussion of vowel harmony in the auxiliary see §2.3.4.3.

                      Intransitive non-min. subj            -a                  -0
    The fact that auxiliaries with a third person object behave in the same way as intransitive
auxiliaries suggests that, rather than third person object being marked in the auxiliary with a
zero morpheme (as might be a more standard analysis), it is actually not marked in the
auxiliary at all (Nordlinger 1993b). This being the case, it is unproblematic to account for
why it is that auxiliaries with a third person object behave in the same way as intransitive
auxiliaries: they are the same in that they do not contain an object bound pronoun. Thus, the
tense-marking system in the auxiliary is based not on whether the clause is transitive or
intransitive, but on whether or not the auxiliary contains an object bound pronoun. Table 5.3
is the revised table of tense distinctions in the auxiliary.9
                 TABLE 5.3: TENSE DISTINCTIONS IN THE AUXILIARY (REVISED)10                                                           Past    J Present        Future
                     With Obj                                     -a                 -u
                     Without Obj min. subj                 -a           -0           -u
                     Without Obj non-min. subj             -a                 -0
   It is interesting that the same three inflections are used in slightly different ways to
differentiate the three tense marking systems. While -u, if it occurs, is always future tense,
-a can be either past or non-future, and -0 can be either present or non-past. If the three-way
system (see Table 5.3) is taken to be basic this can be described in the following way. If two
tense categories are to be collapsed (as happens with auxiliaries with objects, and auxiliaries
with non-minimal subjects and without objects) then the inflection that marks the most
anterior tense (i.e. that which would occur furthest to the left on a time scale going from past
tense to future tense) is generalised to mark the new tense category. For example, when the
auxiliary contains an object, the tense categories of `past' and `present' are collapsed into
`non-future'. The inflection for this new `collapsed' category is that which is used for the
most anterior of the two collapsed categories, that is `past', and is therefore -a. When the
categories of `present' and `future' are collapsed, as they are when an auxiliary contains a
9    Note that I am not claiming that transitive clauses with third person objects have no object. I am
     claiming only that there is no object represented in the auxiliary (i.e. as opposed to the marking being
     zero). Thus, the terms `With Obj' and `Without Obj' in Table 5.3 refer to the absence or presence of an
     object marker in the auxiliary and not to the presence or absence of an object in the clause.
     A possible altern ative analysis, suggested by Jane Simpson (pers.comm.), is to treat the system as
     completely tripart ite such that the present tense suffix has two allomorphs: -a after consonant-final clitics
     (i.e. after the two object bound pronouns), and -0 elsewhere. However, note that consonant final suffixes
     are possible in the auxiliary, in the directional suffixes 05.3), and the progressive suffix (§5.2.3).
     Furthermore, there are other suffixes that also have two-way, rather than three-way, tense distinctions
     such as the habitual suffixes (§5.2.2) and the directional suffixes (§5.3). Analysing all of these as having
     a tripartite system would lead to an enormous amount of homophony, thus I prefer the analysis pi esented
     here.

(-0) is generalised to mark the new category, non-past tense. This explains why it is that the
future tense inflection is never used to mark anything except for future tense, as `future' can
never be the most anterior of two tense categories.","[163, 164, 165]"
