But     first,        what                      is     an alloseme           or a sememe?               Allosemes                of a single                       sememe       are    meanings        which        are     in    complementary                   dis-                      tribution           in the        semantic        environment                   and    are     seman-                       tically       similar.

Allosemes                are    narrow         glosses                       (in    the    sense        of    narrow        transcription),                   while        sememes                       are    the    broad        glosses       from     which            the narrow               glosses                       are    predictable.

                       with Mrs.               Mary        ""Amy""      Cooper          of the        Soohwahlie              Reserve.

                    participants                (actor     and goal)        but      one     or the       other        may
                    not     be    actualized:              the    active       may    lack     a    goal        (""Mary                    is washing            (the     clothes)"")           and the       passive           may     lack       an
