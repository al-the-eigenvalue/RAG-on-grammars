       Pragmatically neutral clauses collected during elicitation follow the VSOword order; word order tests indicate that both VSO and SVO are dominantorders; and statistical analysis indicates a slight preference for the SVO wordorder, followed closely by the VSO order. Thus, HT has VX word order, where Xmay be a subject or an object. Furthermore, it is clear that HT is stronglyinfluenced by pragmatics, including focus, which is the topic of the followingsection (8.2). In the rest of this section, I first discuss examples of the five three-                                         543

"8.1 WORD ORDER OF MAJOR CLAUSAL CONSTITUENTS       In this section, I examine the word order of the major clausalconstituents—subject, object, and verb—in HT. The order of the words in specifictypes of phrase are discussed in the relevant chapters on verbs, nouns, modifiers,adverbs, and numbers—chapters 3 through 7, respectively (e.g., the word orderwithin a noun phrase is discussed in Chapter 4: Nouns and Nominal Morphology).",[560]

The third column shows the statistical frequencies of only transitive clauseswith two additional arguments. Again there is a strong tendency for the object tofollow the verb, as seen in the SVO (39.5%), VSO (34.2%), and VOS (10.5%)orders; the object precedes the verb in the OVS order in 13.2% of the clauses.",[567]

       The word order of the major constituents in a matrix clause is summarizedas follows: when there is neither context nor pragmatic cues (e.g., elicited data),the volunteered word order is VSO, and the order SVO is readily accepted byspeakers. All other orders are problematic in such situations. However, in textsthat have ample context and pragmatic cues, the order SVO is somewhat more
                                       548

"       However, the pragmatics of clausal constituents are not always soenlightening, and it is easy to find a clause in which the meaning of theconstituents does not pragmatically or culturally influence the assignment ofsyntactic roles. Two such clauses are shown below in (734). I want to point outthat the clauses in (734) were volunteered by a speaker with whom I did not                                        536

In each of these examples, the verb saa ‘hit’ co-occurs with two nominals that are culturally equal.204 It is neither more nor lesslikely that John would hit a man than it is that a man would hit John. The clausalpragmatics do not help to determine the syntactic roles of subject and object;therefore a fixed word order is needed, and this word order is VSO.","[561, 562]"

"8.6.1 Subordination           Subordinate clauses in HT have in common three features: (i) thesubordinate clause is always introduced by a complementizer, relativizer, oradverbial relative pronoun,215 (ii) the verb of the subordinate clause is alwaysfinite, and (iii) no particular or special morphology is associated withsubordination, either on the matrix or the subordinate verb. Types of subordinateclause found in HT and covered in this section include relative clauses (8.6.1.1),complement clauses (8.6.1.2), adverbial clauses (8.6.1.3), and conditional clauses(8.6.1.4). The word order of the major constituents is the same in the subordinateclause as it is in the matrix clause; that is, the two preferred word orders are VSOand SVO.",[613]
"       While in the field, I found that during elicitation, the word order of myprobe clause—be it in Spanish or Tepehua—would influence the word order ofthe HT clause of my consultant’s response.

HT nouns arecompletely unmarked for case, and certain nouns, including kinship terms andparts of a whole, are obligatorily possessed.

Of the 1393 entries in the text database, only 940 predications                                        538
were used to determine basic word order. The remaining entries were not usedbecause they were clausal fragments, one-word questions or answers, nonverbalpredicates (i.e., present tense predicate nominal or adjectival constructions that donot require a copula), incomprehensible utterances, or solitary discourse markers,or they were uttered entirely in Spanish.","[562, 563, 564]"

     ‘His donkey took two sacks (of pig excrement).’            [T0055: 016]       The example in (739) shows the fourth most frequent word order: VOS.
This narrative tells how the Tepehua people came to live in Huehuetla. Again,word order is not necessary to determine the grammatical roles of the constituentsbecause people can wash clothes, but clothes cannot wash people.",[570]
       Table 31 shows the various possible word orders in an intransitive clause.,[564]
"       Syntactic analysis of HT is found in Chapter 8: Syntax. Topics discussedin this chapter include word order of major constituents, focus, interrogation,negation, comparative and superlative constructions, and complex clauses. The
                                         28
complex clauses are divided into coordination and subordination, the latter ofwhich is further divided into relative clauses, complement clauses, adverbialclauses, and conditional clauses.","[53, 54]"
"       HT is an under-documented moribund language that is at imminent risk ofextinction within the next two-to-three generations. Thus, this dissertation is amajor contribution not only to the field of linguistics, but also to the Tepehuapeople who might one day be interested in the language of their grandparents.

                               Chapter 1: Introduction1.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE LANGUAGE        Tepehua is an under-documented, moribund, indigenous language that isspoken in the Mexican towns of Huehuetla, Hidalgo and Mecapalapa Puebla.","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"3.1.1 Person and Number Marking        Person and number are co-referenced on the Tepehua verb by prefixation,suffixation, glottalization, and suppletion. Person marking consists of first,second, and third; number consists of singular, simple plural, multiple plural, andfirst person plural inclusive and exclusive. The categories of third person andsingular are not marked overtly on the verb; instead they are the default readingswhen there is no overt person or number morphology on the verb stem. Given thatthere is no case marking on the noun in HT and that there is only one set of freepronouns, grammatical relationships in HT are distinguished by means of wordorder of the major constituents, discourse pragmatics, and pronominal cross-referencing on the verb. The word order (which is both pragmatic and relativelyfixed) is discussed in chapter 8, section 8.1. Pronominal cross-referencing is thetopic of this section.",[199]
"The grammatical roles in this hierarchy are ordered such that if a languagesallows relativization of a particular role, it will also allow relativization of all ofthe roles to the left of it on the hierarchy. For example, if the possessor in asubordinate clause (in a particular language) may be relativized, then allgrammatical roles to the left of the possessor on the hierarchy may also berelativized in that language.",[616]

     ‘The people lost their things.’                                  [T0018: 006]       The clause in example (738) shows the third most frequent word order:OVS. Again, there is only one possible interpretation of the grammatical roles;while a donkey can take two sacks, the reverse is not possible. Furthermore, the                                        544
sacks are more important to the context than the donkey because they illustratethe quantity of pig excrement that the poor man took to sell.","[569, 570]"
"       In (809b), there are actually two relative clauses—juu 7uputulhch‘whoever wanted to eat it’ and juu jaantuch ‘whoever did not’—neither of whichmodifies a head noun or noun phrase; instead the relative clause juu 7uputulhch‘whoever wanted to eat it’ acts as the subject argument of the matrix verb 7ulhch‘ate it’ and the relative clause juu jaantuch ‘whoever did not’ acts as the subjectof the elided verb of the negative verb phrase jaantuch ‘did not’. There are no                                         590
distinct relative pronouns in HT, and the relativizer juu introduces both relativeclauses.217         The Relativization Hierarchy in (810) shows the hierarchy of grammaticalroles (in a subordinate clause) that may be relativized in the world’s languages.218All languages that have relative clauses allow relativization of the subordinatesubject. Different languages allow different grammatical roles to be relativized.","[615, 616]"
"       The example in (736) shows the most statistically frequent narrative wordorder: SVO. This story is about a poor man who tries to sell pig excrement in aneighboring town. This is the first reference in the text to the townspeople juulapanak. Pragmatically, word order is not necessary to disambiguate thegrammatical roles.",[569]

3.1.1.6 Double Object Marking       One of the differences among the various languages in the Totonacanlanguage family has to do with how the object arguments of a ditransitive verb areco-indexed on the verb; some Totonacan languages exhibit symmetrical objectmarking in which both objects are marked on the verb, while others exhibitasymmetrical object marking in which only one object is marked on the verb, andyet other languages exhibit some combination of symmetrical and asymmetricalobject marking (MacKay and Trechsler 2005, 2006).

In (240a), theplural prefix lak-, which co-indexes a third person plural object, precedes thecomitative prefix t'aa-; lak- and its corresponding nominal milhpaati ‘song’ areboth underlined once, while t'aa- and its corresponding nominal Weensis‘Lawrence’ are both underlined twice.

           The prefix 7a- is also used to co-index a plural indirect object. In most—but not all—of these cases, it co-occurs with the plural prefix lak-. In all of theseexamples, 7a- precedes lak-, indicating that it is not co-indexing a plural
indefinite object in these instances. Most of the cases in which 7a- and lak- co-occur involve ditransitive verbs of telling—such as jun ‘tell’, sakmin ‘ask’, andlhiijun ‘order’—that have a plural third person indirect object, shown below in                                          204

Illustration 8: Building a “Linguistic Facility”
       During my time in Huehuetla, I utilized a discourse-centered approach todata collection (Sherzer 1987) in order to understand how and for what purposesHT-speakers use their language in their daily lives. I tried to be a participant in, aswell as an observer of, the community; I took my mini-disk recorder with meeverywhere that I went (along with several of my NSF consent forms), and
                                          15
recorded as often as possible. A discourse-centered approach to research is acrucial component of descriptive linguistic research because one-on-oneelicitation does not produce naturally occurring speech.","[40, 41]"
"         There is conflicting data in HT regarding the morphological order of thesesuffixes. Some of HT examples indicate that –chaa and –chii follow the aspectualmarkers, as seen below in the examples in (390). Other examples indicate that –chaa and –chii precede the perfective aspectual suffix, shown below in (391). In
yet other examples, it is not possible to determine morpheme order becauseperfective aspect is not overtly marked, as seen below in (392).113112 Interestingly, distal –chaa occurs more frequently in my data than proximal –chii does.
113 Jim Watters has suggested to me that the distal and proximal suffixes follow the perfect aspect
marker (–ta), the imperfective aspect marker (-y ~ -‘a), and the future tense marker (-ya7 ~ -a7).
Though I would tend to agree with him, I do not have the necessary data to back this analysis up.
The example in (390a) has the morpheme –palh, which is an allomorph of –pala REP that occurs
only in the perfective aspect. However, this morpheme is not an aspect marker, and it is most
likely the case that this example reflects the order of the distal suffix –chaa with respect to the
repetitive marker –pala and not with respect to perfective aspect.",[325]

The HT classifier system is prototypical(Aikhenvald 2000) in many respects: a classifier forms a constituent with anumber or quantifier, and it serves to categorize the entity or action that thenumber or quantifier modifies according to its shape, humanness, or some othercriteria; there is a ‘generic’ classifier that can be used instead of a more specificone; there is no obligatory plural agreement marking on nouns or verbs; and thereare both sortal and mensurative classifiers.
           In the exercise of counting, HT classifiers are obligatory on the numbersone through 39, and they are optional beginning with the number 40.

First Person
           A first person object—regardless of its number—is indicated on the verbwith the first person object prefix kin- (~ ki-, kim-). Before the dental and alveolar
phonemes /t/, /t'/, /lh/, /ch/, and /ch’/, kin- occurs as [kin-] and [kin-], respectively,and before the velar phoneme /k/, it occurs as [ki-], all of which are representedorthographically by kin-, shown below in (214a). The allomorph kim- occursbefore /p/ and /p’/, shown below in (214b). Everywhere else, the first person
object morpheme may optionally appear as the reduced form ki- [ki-], (214c).(214) a.      kin-lhiisk'awatz'alat'i            ‘You ran me off.’
