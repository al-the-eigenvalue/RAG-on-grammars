6.2.4      SUHlWtY OF THE CllARCES IN THE CLAUSE COllSnTUEBTS         There i s a bas i c change in Tiwi in the way in which a rguments of t he verb
are ind i cated .      In TT , they are defined by cross -re fe rencing ( o r the lack of
i t ) to verbal a f f ixes , whi l e in MT, they a re mainly defined syntact ically by
word order and /or by the marking of the NP in the clause by a prepos i t ion ( o r
t h e lack o f s u c h marking ) .       In MT , the unmarked NPs a re d i s t inguished
synt a c t ically and seman t i c a l l y .       In more formal MT , the subj ect may be
d e t e rmined as in TT , i . e . by cross-refe rence with the subj e ct-tense prefix in
the verb .       In Casual MT , it is mainly d i s t inguished by pos i t ion and
semant i c a l l y ( see a l s o 6 . 8 , p . 29 1 , re word order in the clause ) .",[273]

6.8.2      WORD ORDD ABU PIlOMOKIHALlSAl'IOII III lIT        The word orde r in MT is not as free as in TT . Whe re the re is only an
uninflected ve rb i t seems that the word order has become rigid , being SPO ,
s ince nei the r the subj e c t nor obj e c t are encoded on the ve rb . Whe re there i s
a n inf lected verb the re i s gre a t e r f reedom , since the subj e c t i s encoded on the
ve r b , and the o rder may be reve rsed , though it is not usual to have OPS . PS f o r
intrans i ti ve verbs and OP for trans i t i ve verbs (whe re the subj e c t i s encoded
only on the v e r b ) are more common than OPS .       It would seem that t he normal
order i s reve rsed for similar reasons as for the reve rsal in TT . Whe re it does
not cause confus i on as to what i s subj e ct and obj e ct , the obj e ct may be f ronted
as the theme , as in example 6- 1 0 6 ( a , b ) , or the subj ect may fol low the ve rb , as
new information , as in example 6- 1 06 ( c ) .

use o f free form pronouns in MT. Unlike TT , the se may occur following the ve rb
as we l l as preceding i t .","[301, 302]"

6.3. 1 . 2   IBl'IlAlfSITIVE CLAUSES 1M ItT       In MT , an int rans i tive clause may cons i s t of j u s t a predicate ( p ) ( as in
TT ) , when the subj e c t is marked on the ve rb . When there is an ove rt subj e c t in
the clause , the unmarked order is SP , though this order may be reversed . The
reason f o r revers ing the order has not been s tudied in detail but it would seem
in gene ral that the subj e c t fol lowing the ve rb is e i the r new info rma t i on or old
informa t ion re-introduced ( see 6 . 8 . 2 , p . 2 9 3 for further d i scus s i on ) . When
there is no bound subj ect on the verb , an ove r t subj ect is required , except
und e r certain cond i t ions for de let ion of the subj ect , such as in a purpose
clause ( see 6 . 9 . 6 , p . 30 2 ) , and the o rder always seems to be rigidly SP .",[276]

requi red in the transit ive clause A and 0 , whe re A is the trans i t ive subj ect

by S . Ne i ther have case-marking and they cannot be d i s t inguished by word order

by the same set o f prefixes ( see 4 . 2 . 2 . 1 , p . 1 7 2 ) . Thi s i s another feature in
which Tiwi differs f rom mos t Aus tral ian language s , particularly Pama-Nyungan
languages ( Dixon 1 980 : 28 6 ) . The term S refers to the nominal a rgument required
in a l l verbal clauses and which i s encoded in the ve rb by the f i rs t and se cond

      'we should cause them to bathe'       The order of the morphemes re tained in the speech of young people , though
with changed f orms in some cases , i s given in Table 4 . 4 ( cf . Table 4 . 3 ) . Some
o f the se morpheme s , part icularly those given in parenthese s , do not occur very
often in the MT data and when they do occur it i s usually in fairly formal
speech ( such as e l i c i tation ) . For this reason many of the forms can probably
be regarded as a style closer to trad i t i onal Tiwi ( i . e . a LTT style ) . The only
a f fixes which occur with any regularity in MT are the subj ect-tense prefixes ,
the durat ive aspe c t , the emphat i c prefix and the conne c t i ve s . As has been
pointed out e a r l ie r , a basic charact e r i s t i c of MT i s the use of the verbal
complex con s t ruction rather than the independent inf lected verb and so the use
o f verb s tems ( o the r than the auxi liary verb s tem
also ind i c a t ive of an LTT style rather than MT .
                                                                 -mi ,
                                                                     see 4 . 3 . 2 . 2 , p . 2 l 3 ) is
      In the fol lowing sub-sect ions the morphemes are not d i s cussed in the order
of the i r occurrence in the verb but in the i r grammat i cal categorie s . The
nucleus of the verb is d i scussed f i r s t , then the subj ect-tense prefixe s , d i re ct
and ind i re c t obj e c t prefixes , locat ive and stance prefixes , temporal prefixe s ,
the emphatic pre f i x , voice suf fixes , aspect affixes and mood prefixes .     In each
case , the forms occurring in TT are di scussed fol lowed by the changes apparent
in MT .","[162, 163, 164]"
"        In MT , the re are a number of examp les which are similar to the s t ructure
o f the Pos sess ive NP in TT , as in exampl es 5- 1 4 ( a -d ) . Howeve r , the re a re a
number of cases whe re there i s a demons t r a t ive and / o r a d e s c riptive adj ec tive
occurring before the Pos s e s sed Head , as in examples 5-1 4 ( e ) and ( f ) . Thi s
seems to occur only when the Possessor is manifes ted by a posses s ive pronoun .
Al so , the re is an examp le of a coordinate NP ( see 5 . 1 . 4 ) as the Pos ses sed Head
( example 5 - 1 4 ( g » . The s t ruc ture of the pos s e s sive NP in MT i s given in Table
5.3.     I t wi l l be noted that the re are no examples of empha t i c pronouns or
a l te rnate pronouns as possesso rs . The order may be reve rsed , as in TT , except
in ( 1 ) .",[237]

6. 9     SUBORDIIIArE CLAUSES        In TT , clauses may be j oined together or embedded within each othe r ,
forming more complex sentences .             There are a numbe r o f cases o f subordinate
clause s in TT expres sing d i f ferent re lationships . The subordina t ing s t rategy
used in Tiwi i s that of a subordinat ing conj unc t ion and a clause with a f ini te
ve rb . Glass has found tha t this seems to be the mos t common s t rategy in
Aus t ral ian prefixing languages (Glass 1 980 : 8 ) . The bas i c subordinate
conj unc t i ons i n TT are karri 'when' , expre s s ing a temporal relationship ( 6 . 9 . 3 ,
p . 29 9 ) , pili 'be caus e ' express ing reason ( 6 . 9 . 5 , p . 30 l ) , pili ngini ' in order
to ' , expre s s ing purpose ( 6 . 9 . 6 , p . 30 2 ) and ngini which i s a general subordinate
conj unct ion and complemen t i s e r ( COMPR) ( see 6 . 9 . 7 , p . 304 ) . As wel l as the se ,
the re l a t ive pronouns ( 3 . 3 . 3 , p . 1 1 3 ) and prepo s i t ions ( d is cussed in 5 . 2 , p . 2 3 5 )
may b e used a s subordinate conj unct ions ( see 6 . 9 . 1 ; 6 . 9 . 3 , p . 299 and 6 . 9 . 4 ,

and numerals , and verbals subdivided into inflected verbs and free form verbs .

i n the clause in T T and the o r d e r is rel a tively f re e . The unmarked orde r i s
S P O whe re 0 refers t o e i the r the d i r e ct or se condary obj e c t ( see the d i scussion
in Osbo rne 1 9 7 4 : 62 f ) . Var i a t i ons from this order are due to d i s course
considerat ions , a full d i scussion of which i s outside the scope of this work .
In gene ra l , the ordering can be looked at in te rms of ' theme ' meaning roughly
' the thing be ing talked about ' , as sugge sted by Osbo rne ( 1 9 7 4 : 62 ) . Osbo rne
says that the ' t heme always comes f i r s t in a sentence , regard l e s s of i ts

s i tuation i s a l i t tle more complex than this statement imp l ie s . Of ten when a
topic is being int roduced for the f i r s t t ime it occurs in the theme pos i t ion ,
as in example 6- 1 0 1 though normally new informa t i on is not ini t i a l in the
clause or sentence . 4 7Example      ( 6- 1 0 1 )    ( TT )      (ngintiwatingilipangirrangurlimayani ) , api                      Pipiyanyumili awungaji

      we : would : make : camp      ' (We would walk in the morning when everyone else was a s leep ) then at
      Pipiyanyumi l i , there we would make camp . '     New info rmat ion norma l l y occurs fina l l y , o r near final l y , in the clause
and this new info rmat ion can then become the theme of the next clause . 48Example      ( 6- 1 0 2 )    (TT)      ninki yi , pi             - rri     - pakirayi awarra             Jalingayi .

            seen reflected in the language or languages they teach

Because of the dive r s i ty of the communi ty now it is ver y d i f f i cult for a

into contact with other people , par t i cularly Europeans , through exped i t ions to
the i slands and through shipwrecks . The a t tempt by the mili t i a , in 1 8 2 4 , to

are only two degrees of trans i t iv i ty : d i t rans i t ive and t rans i t ive .","[276, 277, 278]"
"         In general , in TT the mod i f i e r s agree in gender or number with the noun
they modi f y or refer to ( see 3 . 2 . 1 , p . 7S ) , except f o r the manner and locat ive
phrases and clauses , and Engl ish loan nouns used as adj ect ives , as in example
5- 1 ( d ) . Re lat ive clauses are normally int roduced by relative pronouns which
agree in gender or numb e r with the noun to which they re f e r ( see 3 . 3 . 3 ) . The re
are some cases whe re there are clauses which behave as relative clause s , in
that they are closely associated with a head noun , modifying i t , but which do
not have any relat ive pronoun , as in example 5- 1 ( j ) .

"4 6 . The ext reme cases whe re bas i cally only absolute forms of words are

      being t ransmit ted to childre n , who otherwise have the i r primary
      s o c i a l i s a t ion in the dominant language . Discus s i on of language change in

"5 8 . Some of these features shared with Pidgin English and creoles are :      ( i ) The use of -im on t ransi tive Eng l i sh loan verbs .   Some verbs wi th -im
      may have been borrowed d i re c t ly from Pidgin Eng l i sh , but the -im i s now a
      productive t rans i tive marker in MT .    cf . MT : kipim 'give ' with Kr iol : gibit
      'give ' , gibim 'kee p ' ( Sandefur and Sandefur 1 9 7 9 ) . Also kreshim ' crash
      ( t r ) ' i s a recent word .      ( i i ) Some words in MT are obvious ly borrowed from Pidgin Engl ish e . g .                    japi ,

     ( i i i ) The suffix -pal a on the end of s ome adj ectives seems to be a
     borrowing from Pidgin Engl ish e . g . panupala ' funny ' . However in these
     cases the whole word appears to be borrowed ( not many examp le s ) and new
     words are re plac ing the m , of ten with the suf f i x -wan , e . g . faniwan ' funny ' .     ( iv ) The use of the aspect wo rds pin 'pas t ' , sat/stat ' s tar t ' , tra/tray
     ' t ry ' . The f i r s t of the se is clearly borrowed from Pidgin Eng l i sh and also
     occurs in TE .        I am not sure about the l a t t e r two .  They appear to have
     arisen independently of Pidgin English inf luence .             Other aspect words or
     auxi liary verbs which are used in Kriol and o ther creole languages a re not
     used in MT ( su ch as , gona 'will ' ; labda mas 'mus t ' , yusda 'used t o ' ; cf .
     Sande fur 1 9 7 9 : 1 2 6 ) .     ( v ) There are also some features of the 'bas i le c t ' of TE in common with
     Pidgin Eng l i sh , par t i cularly as i t i s used by older people , v i z . the use of
     the gene ral prepo s i t ion long( a ) and the posse s s ive prepo s i t i on play/pla

occurring on the auxi liary. Osborne calls this class of words 'verbal nouns '
( 1 9 7 4 : 5 8 ) , but mos t of them can only occur in this way , closely associated with
a verb and in mos t cases being 'active ' in meaning ( see sect ion 4 . 3 . 2 . 1 , p . 2 1 0 ,
regarding the stem of the auxi l i a ry ) .","[211, 212]"

"      On the surface , it is not clear whe ther the int roduction of Engl ish loan
free form verbs has led to the loss of TT verb stems or vice ve rsa , or whe ther
the l o s s o f the TT ve rbal inf l e c t i ons has led to more grammat i cal r e l a t i ons
being ind i cated by nouns or preposi t ional phrases and to tense , mood and aspect
being s hown by separate words , or the o ther way around , or whe ther the changes
have been simu lt aneous .",[330]

       ( i i ) The complex inf lections of the TT verb have been greatly reduced
( no rma l ly with compensat ion el sewhere see Chapte r 6 and cf . Table 4 . 3 , p . 1 52 ,
and Table 4 . 4 , p . 1 5 4 ) , Thi s has involved the loss of virtually all incorporated
fo rms and the loss of mos t a f f ixes except the subj ect -tense pref ixes and s ome
aspect a f f i xes .     ( i i i ) There is the generalisation of the subj ect -tense pre f ixe s from three
sets ( t rans i t ive , feminine and gene ral ) to one set ( cf . 4 . 2 . 2 . 1 , p . 1 7 2 , and
4.2.2.2, p. 176).      ( iv ) The set o f free form verbs i s expanded in MT to include , as wel l as
some TT-derived forms , loan ve rbs f rom Engl ish or Pidgin Eng l i sh (most
trans i t ive forms have the suf f i x , -im , whi ch i s bor rowed f rom Pidgin Eng l i s h )
and the singular impe rat ive forms of s ome common TT inflected verbs (ta - +
verb stem ) .     ( v ) The three auxi liary verb stems of TT , viz . �i , �a , -kirimi , are

7.4      PHRASES7.4. 1     HOUR PHRASES     The re are relat ively few changes in the s t ructure of the Noun Phrases ,
though there are some :        ( i ) The att r ibutive noun phrase is basically the same s t ructure in MT as
in TT . The d i ffe rences are mainly in the words which may o ccur in each
mod i f i e r pos i t ion . For ins tance , predicatives may be used as descript ive
adj ect ives in MT but not in TT .         In the data on the speech of young chil dren
there are no examples of rela tive clauses 2 ( see 5 . 1 . 1 , p . 22 1 ) .          ( i i ) Po s s e s s ive Phrases in MT may have a modif i e r , o ther than the
Pos s e s s o r before the Head noun , whi ch does not appear to happen in TT ( see
5 . 1 . 2 , p . 227 ) .     ( ii i ) Co-ordinate noun phrases are of three type s all of which appear in
both TT and MT but not to the same degree ( see 5 . 1 . 3 ) .(a)      no conj unc t i on                              TT                            MT
