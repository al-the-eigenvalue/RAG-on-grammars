"5.1 The Simple Clause (mart'iv-i c'ina+da+d+eb+a)šentential word-order, as is to be expected for a language where noun-
functions are indicated by c a š m a r k i n g and, in part, by verb-agreement

can be put in focus by being placed first or last in the clause. For a

5.2.2.1 Adverbial Clauses
52.21.1 Purpose
Esšentially there is a choice between two strategies, a finite and a non-
finite. The finite involves the conjunction rom 'that' or the more archaic
ra-ta (from ra-yta 'through/by means of what') combined typically with (a)
the Prešent or Aorist SUBJunctive (depending on aspect), or (b) the
Pluperfect Indicative [sicj8. Combination (a) is usual after a non-past main
verb, combination (b) after a past tense verb. The subordinate clause
follows the main, e.g.

    The non-finite strategy can be used regardless of the tense of the
introductory verb, as long as the purpose is positive (i.e. non-negative) and

either the SUBJect or object of the main verb. The subordinate verb stands
in the Adverbial case of the Future Participle. If the verb is Transitive, its
direct object will surface as an objective Genitive, e.g.   lenin-ma e + s k'alam-i            ga-mo-(Ø-)i-q'(+)en-a

   'lenin used this pen to write that letter'    In the following example it is the indirect object of the main verb who
will perform the action of the Future Participle:   maj-eb-i        ga-v-(Ø-Ø-)u-švir-e                         bork'il-eb-is

   'I held my wrists to X (sc. for X) to put on the handcuffs'     On page 123 of the 1981 second edition of the complete works of D.
K'ldiashvili there is an example where both the notional direct and indirect
objects end up side by side in the Genitive with such a Future Participle
(viz. q'ru-d q'+op+n-is tav-is da-sa-g+c'-ev-ad deaf-ADV being-
GEN head-GEN PREV-FuT.PTC-avoid-TS-ADV                'to avoid being deaf).
However, quoting this very example KEGl put the indirect object into a
postpositional phrase (viz. q'ru-d q'+op+n-isa-gan tav-is da-sa-g+c'-
e v a d ) — i s the 1981 edition defective, or is the double Genitive a
legitimate treatment paralleling the example quoted in 5.1.5 (namely:

em-a (Ø-)e-k'rjal-eb-a 'the bride is forbidden to give voice to the
elders of the family for upto three years')? The postpositional treatment of
the indirect object is seen in: k'oncert'-ze da-sa-sc'r-eb-ad č a - m o -
vid-a 'X came to attend the concert' (cf. k'oncert'-s da-(Ø-)e-sc'r-o 'X
attended the concert'). On the other hand, the Genitive is used in:
vepx+is+t'q'a+osn-is k'val-is mi-sa-gn-eb-ad 'in order to locate the
track of The Man in the Panther's Skin' (cf. k'val-s mi-(?Ø-Ø-)a-gn-o 'X

indirect object but no obvious direct object) and in:

    An alternative non-finite strategy that makes the Genitive of the
Masdar dependent on m i z n - i t , the Instrumental of m i z a n - i 'aim', is
condemned by purists as a calque on the Russian construction s cel'ju (+
Gen) 'with the aim of...'. However, if one allows it, the relevant section of
the example 'lenin used this pen to write that letter' would be m a g

ditransitive becomes indirect object of the matrix causative, the embedded
indirect object becomes an oblique object governed by the usual

"5.2.2.1.5 Concession
Esšentially there are two conjunctions that mark concession: tu+mc(a)
'although' is found with non-SUBJunctive verbs, whilst tu+nd(+a(+c)) 'even
if' is principally used in association with the Prešent SUBJunctive for
prešent concessions, with the Aorist SUBJunctive for future concessions, or
with the Pluperfect Indicative for past concessions. The latter conjunction
is analysable as tu 'if', the modal particle u+nd+a 'it is necessary', and -c
'even', which element occurs on a number of subordinating conjunctions and
pronouns to distinguish them from their interrogative variants—sometimes
this clitic attaches to some other word within the clause rather than to the
concessive conjunction itself. In addition to tu, the former conjunction
contains the now obsolete formant -mc(a), whose role in OldGEORGIANwas
to lend a šense of non-factuality to the indicative with which it was
construed. Examples:      tu+nd xvale      mo-m-k'1-a-n,                      a r m-e-nagvl-eb-a

The simplest construction has ro+gor+c 'as' (cf. interrogative ro+gor?
'how?') introducing an indicative verb, the order of the two clauses being
irrelevant, e.g.   ro+gor+c        šen      g-e-p'rian-eb-a,            i+s + e
   as           you(DAT) you-IOV-appeal-TS-it           so
   mo-(Ø-)i-kec-i
   PREV-(you-)PASS-act-AOR.INDIC(=I MPER)
   'Act as the fancy takes you'    If the correlative is i + m + gvar + ad(-ve) 'in (just) that way', the
manner-clause will be introduced by ro+gor+ada+c, whilst a parallel
correlative-conjunctional coupling is i+m+nair+ad(-ve)...ra+nair+ada+c.
    If the above reprešent factual clauses of manner, the situation is
somewhat different in the case of hypothetical manner-clauses. The
subordinating conjunction is t+i+tk+o(+s) 'as if, as though', which derives
from tu i+tkv+a 'if it was/is said' or tu i+tkv+a+s 'if it transpires that it
is said'. The conjunction permits three constructions: (a) the verb will be in
that tense of the indicative which is appropriate to the demands of the
main verb; (b) the Prešent SUBJunctive may replace the Prešent Indicative if
59Ø                         GEORGIANGRAMMARthe main verb is non-past, whilst the III rd SUBJunctive may replace an
Aorist Indicative or Perfect that would have occurred in the putative
original direct speech, regardless of the tense of the main verb; (c) given
the prešence of a form of the verb 'say' within the conjunction, the clause
may reflect the reporting of original speech (or thought) by coupling the
speech-particle -o with the words originally spoken (or thought), e.g.      sax-is       ga+mo+me+t'q'v+el+eb+a i+s+e+t-i

5.2.2.1.7.1'when'
The basic temporal conjunctions are the fully interchangeable
r(+)o+de+sa+c and r(+)o+ca 'when' (cf. interrogative r( + )o + di+s?
'when?'), either of which will stand at the start of a clause containing an
indicative verb, e.g.      r(+)o+de+sa+c / / r(+)o+ca mo-x-val,                šen-i

appearing in contexts where it seems more appropriate to translate them
as 'when'.
    The general subordinator rom is frequently used, especially in speech,
in a temporal šense, so that the subordinate clause in the above-example

suitable insertions to protect the clitic rom from claušinitial position. The
non-finite method of expressing the basic temporal notion is to use the
Masdar of the subordinate verb. It stands in the Genitive case, being
dependent upon dro-s, Dative of the noun dro 'time', e.g.   tv+it+m+pr+in+av-ši š s v l - i s                  dro-s    gul-is

Genitive base within the Masdar alone (i.e. š s v l - i s a - s ) .5.2.2.1.7.2 'as soon as'
Two finite reprešentations exist. The first places the words ro+gor+c k'i
'as soon as' at the start of the indicative subordinate clause, which may
either precede or follow the main clause, e.g.   ro+gor+c k'i       šen-i     c'er+il-i     mo-m-i-va,

   'As soon as your letter reaches me, I shall read it'    The second strategy is based on the formation of alternative questions
and places the words tu ara 'or not' immediately after the subordinate
verb; a peculiarity of this strategy is that the subordinate clause must
precede the main clause, so that the first clause in the last example may be
recast to give either:   šen-i c'er+il-i mo-m-i-va tu ara,...or mo-m-i-va tu ara šen-i c'er+il-i,...","[607, 608, 609, 610]"
"1.9 Principles of CitationAll words are divided into constituent morphemes. Morpheme-boundaries
are indicated either by the hyphen or a plus-sign, the latter (+) being used
either when the identity of each morpheme is not important to the
particular phenomenon being explained (and thus they are not individually
glossed in those instances where morpheme-analyses are provided) or when
it is suspected that a morpheme-boudary is present but the precise analysis
might be unclear. For example, we could gloss each component of the Past
Participle 'baked' thus:
     ga-mo-m-cxv-ar-i
     Preverb-Preverb-Past.Participle.Prefix-bake-Past.Participle.Suffix-
                                                              Agreement.Marker
but it would normally be important only to know that this word is a verbal
adjective meaning 'baked', and it would therefore usually be presented
simply as:
     ga+mo+m+cxv+ar-i
     baked-AGR
     'baked'
     To illustrate the second case let us take the verbal noun (Masdar) of
the copula, q'+op+n-a, where the Masdar-formant is the final -a.
16                            GEORGI AN GRAMMARComparing this non-finite form with the finite v-i-q'av-i 'I was' vs i-q'+o
<= earlier i-q'v-a 'X was', we see that the root is -q'((a)v)- (with v -
marking 1st person subject, (-)i- an old passive marker 6 , -i an Indicative
exponent for the Aorist tense, and -a/+o the indicator of a 3rd person
singular subject). Readers will see that I have glossed the old passive
marker with such (Series 11 ) forms of the copula as the Subjective Version
vowel, even though, rather arbitrarily, I have glossed what in origin was
the same i-vowel in the Future Sub-Series forms of the copula, which
derive from an old passive of another root meaning 'do, make' (namely
-k(m)n-), as the Passive marker. What then in the Masdar are the
components - o p - and - n - ? An equals-sign (=) is used either where the
script would itself employ a hyphen or to indicate reduplication. A
question-mark applied to a whole word raises doubts as the
acceptability/existence of that word; when applied to an agreement-affix
within a verb, it questions either the presence of that (zero-)affix or
uncertainty as to the implied referent.
    The provenance of some examples is stated, but mostly no such source
is quoted. A large number of citations are taken from the illustrative
material in KEGL; most of the rest have been noted by me over the years
from my general reading of, and/or listening to, Georgian; occasionally
simple sentences were made up by myself.
    Readers cannot fail to notice the imbalance in the length of the
chapters, with Chapter 4 on verbal morphology representing more than all
the other chapters put together. This is a natural consequence of the fact
that the chief difficulty (and, to the linguist, greatest attraction) of
Georgian resides in the wonderful complexity of the verbal system. I have
endeavoured to give too much rather than too little information on the
various conjugational patterns (to such an extent that I suspect some may
accuse me of unnecessary spoon-feeding). However, as the verb is the
essence of this language, I felt it was important that readers new to the
language should be able to turn up immediately any particular 'screeve' (=
tense-, mood- or aspect-paradigm) and see how any individual sub-class of
verb conjugates therein. I have also tried to give as much guidance as I
could to help readers see and understand the many highways and byways
traversed by individual verb-roots.","[34, 35]"
"5.1.4 Adpositions
GEORGIANis a postpositional language. The most frequently governed cases
are the Genitive and Dative, though only the Vocative and Ergative are
totally excluded from postpositional governance. Some postpositions stand
as separate words, whilst others fuse with their (pro-)nouns and were thus
described by Vogt as 'secondary cases'. The formal parallelism between
certain postpositions and verbal preverbs (e.g. -gan 'from' as in šen-gan
'from you' vs its preverbal role in a verb like gan-(Ø-)a-iarag-es PREV-
(X-)NV-disarm-they(AOR.INDIC) 'they disarmed X', or -Si 'in' as in q'ut-ši
'in the/a box' vs its preverbal role in a verb like š ( Ø - ) a - i a r a g - e s
PREV-(X-)NV-arm-they(AORJNDIC) 'they armed X') suggests an adverbial
origin, which in some instances is stIII actually manifested in OldGEORGIAN.
Some postpositions such as garda 'apart from' sometimes stand before
their noun, in which case the long form of the Genitive is obligatory (e.g.
si+amaq'-is garda/garda si+amaq'-isa 'apart from pride'). Another
common example is mi+u+xed+av+ad 'despite', which is the Adverbial
c a š f o r m of the privative participle of mi-xed-v-a 'looking to'.
     Note the position of the postpositional phrase in theGEORGIAN
translation of phrases like 'the problem of Great Britain's relationship with
the other countries of Europe' (i.e. between the adnominal Genitive and the
head-noun), viz.
542                        GEORGIANGRAMMAR   did-i        brit'an+et-is evrop'-is   sxva        kveq'n-eb-tan

GEORGIAN'sverbal noun is not normally referred to as an infinitive
(sa+c'q'+is-i) because it lacks verbal governance (cf. Hewitt 1983b for a
discussion of verbal governance with the OldGEORGIANinfinitive). Since
GEORGIANmasdars (the Arabic term for 'verbal noun', which inGEORGIANis
s a x e l - z m n a ) behave like nouns, the underlying direct object of a
transitive verb will surface as an adnominal Genitive (e.g. c'ign-eb-is
k'itx-v-a book-Pl-GEN read-TS-MASD(NOM) 'the reading of books').
Subjects of intransitive verbs will also stand in the Genitive alongside the
Masdar (e.g. p'rezident'-is gada-dg-om-a president-GEN              PREV-
stand.down-TS-MASD(NOM) 'the standing down of the president').
     Transitive subjects are typically governed by one of the agentive
postpositions mier 'by' (or -gan 'from, by'), e.g.      mo+kalak+e-ta mier up+1+eb-eb-is             ga-mo-q'(+)en-eb-a

      'the making use of their rights by (the) citizens'
      k'irile-s    a+ma-t-gan            da-nax-v-a
      K'irile-GEN this-Pl(GEN)-from      PREV-spot-TS-MASD(NOM)
      'the spotting of K'irile by these'    Even in ModernGEORGIANthe Genitive alone is not unknown (e.g. om-
i—deda-ta bavšv-is ča-c-m-a war-NOM—mother-Pl(GEN)               chiîd-GEN
PREV-clothe-TS-MASD(NOM) 'war—the dressing of children by mothers';
p'olici-is mart-v-a kalak-isa poiice-GEN steer-TS-MASD(NOM) town-
GEN 'the steering (governing) of the town by the police'). Where both
subjective and objective Genitive are prešent, as in these last two
examples, all instances to hand display the subjective preceding the
objective, with the Masdar possibly splitting the two.
    Though the prešence of mier is normally determined by the transitivity
of the Masdar, it can also be found marking the intransitive subject of
verbs which, though Intransitive, are semantically 'active, agentive', e.g.

treated as if it were a noun and given the long desinence appropriate to
the noun it qualifies; this phenomenon is most often seen for Genitive and
Dative NPs, e.g.   (Ø-)e-rid-eb-od-a                     jvel-isa   da sa+šua+l-i

   'X shed light on several unknown and opaque problems'    An oddity was noted in literary Georgia (ll-XI-88, p. 13): as we have
seen, adjectives meaning 'possessed of N' may be freely formed by using
the derivational suffix -ian-i, so that 'a mother with a child' will be
bavšv-ian-i deda. The noun-base of such adjectives is itself qualifiable
by an adjective, and the example in question reads: ak'van-ši m+q'+op-i
bavšv-ian-i deda-c 'and a mother with a child (being) in a cradle'. A
native speaker, when prešented with this example for comment, reacted
somewhat negatively to the prešence on the epithet of the final vocalic
agreement-affix. If such compounds as m+k'vet+r+na+k'vt+eb-ian-i
'sharp-featured' (<= m+k'vet+r-i plus na+k'vt-eb-i), naz+bumbul-ian-i
'soft-downed' and lamaz+q'd-ian-i 'with beautiful covers (of books)'
reprešent the norm, then the bare stem for the adjective (namely m+q'+op)
would indeed be anticipated here. Note also the almost exact parallel to
the oddity above in Vazha Pshavela's ga+šav+eb+ul sa+rkv+el-ian-ad
'blackened cover and all', where the qualifying participle is without any
ending.
    When the kinship-terms m a m a 'father', deda 'mother', bija 'uncle',
p'ap'a/babua 'grandfather', di+deda/bebia 'grandmother', m a m + i + d a
'father's sister', and de+i+da 'mother's sister' are coupled with a possessive
adjective, the possessive is placed after the noun and written with a
hyphen to indicate that the sequence is viewed as a single word, such that
only the possessive changes for case.
    Quantifiers prescriptively require the singular form of the noun, though

    In an example like '3 Xs of Y(s)'GEORGIANtreats 'Y' as the head of the
expression, whilst the rest functions as a complex quantifier, as exemplified
by three c a š f o r m s for the expression '3 baskets of apples', where sam-i

reduced relative clauses may be accompanied by arguments from that

participles of transitive verbs the underlying direct object becomes an
objective Genitive, e.g.

"'Motion' (2nd/3rd person subject)
The root that serves as an honorific copula when preverbless, namely
-brjan-, when endowed with a preverb expressing direction becomes an
honorific for the basic verb of motion (e.g. mo-(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t 'you
(will) come' => Aorist mo-(Ø-)brjan-d-i-t, Perfect mo-(Ø-)brjan-eb-
ul-x-a+r-t). It is particularly common in asking questions (e.g. sad mi-
(Ø-)brjan-d-eb-i-t? 'where are you going?) and in issuing commands (e.g.
mi-(Ø-)brjan-d-i-t, g-txov-t 'After you, please' = 'Go thither, I beg
you'). When the preverb is da-, the meaning of the verb-form is 'sit down',
whilst with a- the meaning is 'stand up'.
496                         GEORGIANGRAMMAR'Speak' (2nd/3rd person subject)
The root -brjan- when used transitively (again without preverb) means
'speak' or 'issue an instruction'. Examples: ra-s (Ø-Ø-)brjan-eb-t? 'what
are you saying?', (Ø-Ø-)brjan-e, äen-i xmal-i da čem-i k'iser-il
literally 'Speak, your sword and my neck' = 'Say what you want, I am yours
to command', sardal-ma (Ø-Ø-)brjan-a še+t'+ev+a-ze gada-svl-a
'the general ordered the going over to the attack'. When endowed with the
Objective Version, we get (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-brjan-eb 'you (will) give X/them
command Y','Say to'
Regardless of subject the usual verb for 'say to' can give way for reasons
of politeness to mo-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xs+en-eb 'you (will) say X/them to
Y/them'278 (e.g. mag-is še+sa+x+eb vera+per-s mo-(Ø-)g-a-xs+en-

"Some members of the class may appear with a direct object (e.g.
(Ø-)tamaš-ob 'you are playing' vs čog+burt-s (Ø-Ø-)tamaš-ob 'you are
playing tennis'). However, in ModernGEORGIANthese verbs have acquired
a full set of screeves across the three Series by virtue of borrowing from
variant-forms of their root, specifically, in the words of Shanidze
(1973.§418), they 'turn to the subjective versional form of the active voice
of their very own root in order to fill in their missing forms: cxovrobs,
cxovrobda, cxovrobdes [Prešent and Imperfect Indicatives plus Prešent
Subjunctive of the verb 'live'—BGHÎ but i-cxovrebs, i-cxovra [Future and
Aorist Indicatives of the same verb—BGH]. Today we understand these as
forms of one and the same verb ... but in origin they were different verbs:
i-cxovrebs is the subjective version which has as its neutral version a-
CXOVrebS ['X makes Y live'—BGH1. But this form of the subjective version is
drained of any versional content by virtue of the fact that it has been
deprived of its direct object and, as a verb that has been left objectless,
has become intransitive. Despite this, it has retained two markers of a
transitive verb, the one syntactic, the other morphological: (a) with IInd
Series forms it takes its subject in the Narrative case ..., (b) forms of the
III rd Series are produced through inversion and, linked to this, its subject
stands in the Dative ... The verb acxovra has both subject and direct
object: k'ot'em k'argad acxovra col-švili ['K'ot'e gave wife and child a good
life'—BGH]. By the way, as direct object the reflexive pronoun tavi is also
possible with it [tavs saca unda vacxovreb ['I shall settle myself down
wherever it proves necessary'—BGH] (Vazha Pshavela, V,6,ll). But what
34Ø                       GEORGI AN GRAMMARon earth is the direct object with the subjective versional icxovra man?
['What' did it 'make live'?—seemingly tavi ['itself'—BGH], which was lostt
since it was the one and only [possible object—BGH] and thus easily
understood. Because of the loss of its object the verb lost its transitivity
and thus came to match the Medial and took upon itself the function of
filling the Medial's missing forms. Only its syntactic force in the IInd and
IIIrd Series and the morphological indicator in the III rd Series (inversion)
remind us of its active [sc. voice—BGH] formation'.
     This lengthy quote introduces a number of important features that are
characteristic of the Medial Verbs: the Future Indicative (sc. of Medišis
which have no indirect object associated with them; such 'relative' Medišis
will be discussed separately below) is produced by resorting to the
formant-combination i-...-eb, which is taken by Holisky (1981.1)80 as the
defining phenomenon of the Class81, so that the Future Indicatives 'it will
rain' and 'you will play (tennis)' are (?Ø-)i-c'vim-eb-s and (šog+burt-s)
(Ø-Ø-)i-tamaš-eb; in origin these are active voiced Transitive Verb-
forms in Subjective Version with an understood reflexive tav-i 'head; self'
as direct object 82 , and as such the Conditional and Future Subjunctive are
formed as would one anticipate for any Transitive Verb with Thematic
Suffix -eb; Series 11 and 111 are then formed from such Transitive Verb-
forms (almost!) as one would expect, viz. being characterised by, with one
exception, a Weak Aorist Indicative and in all cases an Aorist Subjunctive
in -o, coupled with Ergative subject throughout Series II, and by Inversion
coupled with Dative subject (and, where applicable, Nominative direct
object) in Series III, so that the Aorist Indicatives 'it rained' and 'you
played (tennis)' are (?Ø-)i-c'vim-a and (čog+burt-i) (Ø-Ø-)i-tamaa-e,
whilst the Perfects are (Ø-)u-c'vim-i-?a and (čog+burt-i) g-i-tamaš-
(n-)i-a; though not stated explicitly, it is clear from the quoted forms that
the Medials do not employ preverbs in the perfective screeves, a fact
which is ascribed by Holisky to their esšentially atelic aspect, which is
incompatible with the basically perfectivising function of the preverbs. I
part company with Shanidze only insofar as he assumes that, once these
forms have been borrowed, they take on the intransitivity of the verb-
forms to which they act as paradigm-fillers. Writing a traditional grammar
in an age when it would have been highly unusual to operate with more
than a single level of description (for his Fundamentals of the Grammar of
theGEORGIANlanguage first appeared as such in 1953 and even then was
based on a number of revisions dating back to a slimmer 214-page volume
of 193Ø), it was not open to Shanidze to posit the prešence underlyingly of
the original direct object tav-i that he clearly regarded as the motivation
for the Subjective Version in the screeves of the Future Sub-Series and of
                             VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                             341Series II (as well as, of course, for the prešence of Inversion in Series III).
We are not today so restricted, and, as I have argued in a number of
places (1983, 1987a, 1989, 1995), it is by taking for granted the esšential
(underlying) transitivity of Medial Verb-forms outside the Prešent Sub-
Series that one arrives at the most convincing account of the morpho-
syntax of Medišis and related phenomena. Where we have such forms as
(?Ø-)i-c'vim-eb-s 'it will rain' or (Ø-)u-c'vim-i-?a 'it apparently rained',
I place a question-mark before the 3rd person morph to shew that there is
no argument external to the verb correlating with it, even though
according to the analysis just advanced I assume that the relevant
argument is prešent underlyingly but obligatorily deleted once the verb's
transitivity has been established and the agreement-markers have been
assigned accordingly.
    In addition to not taking preverbs where one would otherwise have
expected them to occur, the other morphological oddity of Medišis resides
in the fact that, even though almost all of them behave like Transitive
Verbs with Thematic Suffix -eb in the Future Sub-Series and Series II, no
Thematic Suffix appears in the Perfect (or in either of the other two
screeves of Series III), but a strange element -n- may optionally be used 83
immediately after the root in all three Series III screeves for those
Medišis whose root-structure does not make the addition of such a nasal
difficult to pronounce. We have already met such a formant, as with the
Transitive root -t'ac-, where the Perfect may be formed normally or with
the aid of this nasal, e.g.   okro-s      kurd-s       ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-t'ac-eb
   gold-DAT thief-DAT PREV-PREV-(you-it-)him-snatch-TS(FUT)

   hand-from
   'you will snatch the gold from the hand of the thief'=> Aorist okro kurd-s ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-t'ac-e xel-i+dan => Perfect
okro kurd-is-tvis        ga-mo-g-i-t'ac-n-i-a/ga-mo-g-i-t'ac-eb-i-a
xel-i+dan. I have suggested elsewhere (1987b) that this nasal may be the
remnant of an earlier formant -in-, just as in Mingrelian one finds exactly
this sequence sometimes turning up in Series 111 of Medials (e.g. Aorist ti-
k (?Ø-)i-ngar-u =GEORGIANman (?Ø-)i-t'ir-a 'X cried' vs Perfect
ti-s    (Ø-)u-ngar-(in-)?u   =GEORGIANm a - s      (Ø-)u-t'ir-(n-)i-?a 'X
apparently cried'), which I related to the Causative formant, arguing that
the Causative may have been employed to reinforce the Transitive status
of the verb-forms in question, just as today one can point to a number of
342                           GEORGI AN GRAMMARcases where the morphological Causative (see 4.8) does not differ in
meaning from the corresponding non-Causative but Transitive form (e.g.
(Ø-Ø-)a-rb-en = (Ø-Ø-)a-rb-en-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to run').
The reason why the Thematic Suffix -eb- itself cannot be used is that its
prešence would entirely alter the meaning. The reason for this is as
follows: outside the Prešent Sub-Series, as we have stated, Medišis borrow
the Subjective Version variant of a form of their root which otherwise is
produced by means of the a-versioniser in combination with the Thematic
Suffix -eb. We, thus, have such pairs as: (Ø-?Ø-)i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will
speak' vs (Ø-Ø-)a-lap'arak'-eb 'you (will) get X/them to speak'. The
former has the Perfect g - i - l a p ' a r a k ' - ( n - ) i - ? a vs Pluperfect g - e -
lap'arak'-(n-)?a vs III rd Subjunctive g-e-lap'arak'-(n-)o-?s, whereas
the latter has the Perfect g-i-lap'arak'-eb-i-a vs Pluperfect g - e -
lap'arak'-eb-in-a vs III rd Subjunctive g-e-lap'arak'-eb-in-o-s. And
so, we see that with the Thematic Suffix -eb prešent the verb-form
actually has the meaning of the (pseudo-)Causative from which the Medial
(outside the Prešent Sub-Series) is itself derived.
    The one Medial which does not have the Weak conjugation in its Aorist
Indicative is (Ø-Ø-)grjn-ob 'you feel/perceive X/them'. Additionally, this
Medial is one of the exceptions in terms of its Future Sub-Series formation,
for its Future Indicative is (Ø-Ø-)i-grjn-ob. Its Series II screeves
conjugate thus:      Aorist Indicative           Aorist Subjunctive
      v-[Ø-)i-grjen-i             v-(Ø-)i-grjn-o
      (Ø-Ø-)i-grjen-i             (Ø-Ø-)i-grjn-o

      (Ø-Ø-)i-grjen-i-t           (Ø-Ø-)i-grjn-o-t
      (Ø-)i-grjn-es               (Ø-)i-grjn-o-n    Series III is then: Perfect g-i-grjvn-i-a (N.B. the root-expansion),
Pluperfect g-e-grjn-o, III rd Subjunctive g-e-grjn-o-s. Medišis only
ever occur with a 3rd person direct object, and since all Medišis apart
from 'feel' have a Weak Aorist Indicative conjugation ending in -a for a
3rd person singular subject, and since the Pluperfect is formally akin to the
Aorist Indicative, all Medišis apart from 'feel' have Pluperfect ending in -a
(and, of course, III rd Subjunctive in -o-s). To illustrate the full Series II

Thematic Suffixes. Given the Prešent Indicative, the Imperfect Indicative
and Prešent Subjunctive are formed as one would expect, except that
where the Prešent Indicative appears to shew the Thematic Suffix -i (as in
(Ø-)t'ir-i 'you cry'), the Imperfect Indicative and Prešent Subjunctive
incorporate -od- and not -d- alone (e.g. (Ø-)t'ir-od-i 'you were crying',
(Ø-)t'ir-od-e 'may you be crying'); indeed, in the Prešent Indicative some
speakers add the Prešent Indicative of the copula when a Medial in -i has
a 1st or 2nd person subject, so that 'cry' conjugates thus:   Present Indicative      Imperfect Indicative      Prešent Subjunctive

Perfect g-i-t f ir-(n-)i-a => Pluperfect g-e-t'ir-(n-)a. With direct object,
this root usually means 'mourn = weep for' (e.g. tkven g-t'ir-od-nen 'they
were mourning/weeping for you(Pl.)'), though in the following example we
seem to have more of an internal object (viz. čven-s sa+t'ir+al-s
kart+ul-ad v-(Ø-)t'ir-i-t 'we cry our weeping-ceremony 84 inGEORGIAN');
sometimes the verb is written with an agreement-prefix s- in such cases

Notes
1   Historically the -s was the Genitive singular added to a stem ending in -e. For the
    analysis see Mač'avariani (1959).
2 It has been suggested that this is an importation from Old Armenian, where the ending
    is normal for the Instrumental case of i-stem nouns (e.g. ban-iw 'by/with/through
    word'). This hypothesis perhaps accounts for the šense in which the ending -iv is
    used inGEORGIAN,but it fails to explain why this borrowing should have capitalised on
    the Instrumental desinence only for Armenian i-stem nouns when no such borrowing
    seems to have taken place from the more common Armenian a-stems (e.g. a m - a w
    'by/with/through year'; Yisous ašakert-aw-k h -n iwr-ov-k h gnac h Jesus(NOM)
    disciple-INST-Pl-the      his-INST-Pl    he.departed 'Jesus left with his disciples'), unless
    k'vla+v 'again' is to be so analysed. The only alternative explanation I have seen
    supposes that originally the particle -ve was suffixed to the citation-form of the
    adjective or participle and that in time the word-final e-vowel was lost by apocope.
    This proposal, however, as far as I can see, completely fails to account for the
    meaning of the forms in -iv.
3 Or Dative perhaps?
4 vidre (cf. 5.2.3.1) may also be used with the object of comparison, which in such
    instances stands in the same case as the entity with which it is being compared (e.g.
    i+s upro did-i-a vidre e+s that(NOM) more big-NOM-is than this(NOM 'that one is
    bigger than this one').
5 Discussing a parallel phenomenon in Mingrelian, namely net'e go-m-o-k'et-eb-ap-
    u-ni =GEORGIANnet'avi (rom (- -ni)) ga-m-a-k'et-eb-in-a 'Would that X
    made/were to make me do it', K'iziria (1982:89) comments: 'the trivalent verb has
    become bivalent; as subject is the noun placed in the Dative.' In other words, he
    views the pronominal element - m - , which correlates with a notionally Dative 1st
    person singular pronoun outside the verb (here unexpressed), as the subject. I find
    this a rather extreme analysis in view of the fact that surely we may simply add to the
    Mingrelian g o r o n t - k (and I suspect g m e r t - m a to theGEORGIAN)'God-ERG'
    (historically speaking at least this is the Ergative case in Mingrelian) to make explicit
    the true subject that is left understood in most cases, cf. the followingGEORGIAN
    phrase with this subject actually prešent alongside the Aorist Indicative gmert-ma
    î?0-)g-i-švel-a, which expresses the wish 'May God help you!'. Tuite (1991.150)
    accepts K'iziria's view in his discussion of theGEORGIANphenomenon.
6 Cf. the use of -u plus an indicative verb in Svan today. See also 5.2.2.1.1.
7 An exact parallel exists in Mingrelian g-a-lu-ap-u-k =GEORGIANg-e-vl-eb-i, from
    which the Adverbial case of the Past Participle is g o - l u - a p - i r - o , as in the
    expression skan-i go-lu-ap-ir-o čkim-i dud-i 'may my head be your encircled',
     so that skan-i go-lu-ap-ir-o is used much likeGEORGIANg-e-na+cva(l-e), cf. also
    kә-go-r-lu-ap-e-d-a-k! =GEORGIANäe-mo-g-vl-eb-od-e! 'may I encircle you!'.
     In Abkhaz we s-wә-k'ә+x+әa-x[a]-aa+yt' 'may I encircle you(MASC)' or 5-wә-
    k'ә+x+sa-w+p' 'I am your(MASC) encircler = darling', cf. yә-wә-x-sa s-a-g[a]-
    ša+yt' 'let what may befall you(MASC) carry me off!': if one were to address these
     expressions to a woman, the - w ә - would be replaced by - b ә - . N.B. the underlined
     sibilant reprešents retroflex articulation.
8 Aorist i-jr-a, Perfect Jr-ul-a. Cf. mic'+is-jvr+a 'earthquake'.
9 Presumably the suffix is analysable as the posposition -tan, here though governing the
     Genitive, plus the adjective-formant -a; when used nominally the Genitive is in -a-s.
 10 As a general term of address we have the Vocative, as in: s'en, m a v a n - o ,
     m+k'itx+a+oba m-i-čuk-eb-i-a šen-tvis you(VOC) man-VOC                 clairvoyance(NOM)
     I-OV-prešent-TS-PERF-it       you-for 'you, man, to you I seem to have given the gift of
     clairvoyance'.
4      Verbal Morphology4.0.   IntroductionThe very esšence of theGEORGIANlanguage (as well as the source of much
of its difficulty) resides in its verbal system. And it is advisable to spend a
while on an overview of the system before entering into detailed
description.
    The following are the morphemes that may occur in aGEORGIANverb-
form, though not necessarily simultaneously: 1. Preverb(s), 2. Pronominal
Agreement-Prefix, 3. Version-Vowel, 4. Root, 5. Causative suffix(es), 6.
Inceptive/Passive Marker, 7. Thematic Suffix, 8. Perfect/Stative Marker,
9. Imperfect Marker, 10. Mood-Vowel, 11. Pronominal Agreement-
Suffix(es). The Prešent, Past and Aorist Subjunctive of the copula are
incorporated by some verbs into part of their conjugational paradigms. In
OldGEORGIANa further suffixal morpheme that is no longer attested in the
literary language was an element whose prešence was triggered by some
plural Nominative nouns, e.g.     c'ign-i        da-v-(Ø-)c'er-e
     book-NOM      PREV-I -(it-)write-I NDI C(AOR)
     'I wrote the/a book'vs
     c'ign-n-i         da-v-(Ø-)c'er-en
     book-Pl-NOM       PREV-I -(3rd.PER-)write-Pl(i NDI C.AOR)
     I wrote books'1which latter today would be: c'ign-eb-i (/c'ign-n-i) da-v-(Ø-)c'er-e.
    Detailed information is offered later in the chapter for each of the
above-morphological elements. In the meantime, preverbs can be thought
of as somewhat akin to the adverbial components of English phrasal verbs.
Version-vowels indicate certain types of relationships holding between the
verbal arguments (e.g. between subject and direct or indirect object, or
118                        GEORGI AN GRAMMARbetween direct and indirect objects); traditionally there exist Neutral,
Subjective, Objective and locative Versions. Thematic Suffix is the term I
have chošen to describe the set of morphemes according to which the
formation of the tense-mood-aspect paradigms of the language's Transitive
and Intransitive verbs is sub-divided; other terms that have been used for
these morphemes are Prešent(-Future) Stem Formants or Series Markers.
A few examples of the above-verbal morphemes in concrete and regular
verbal complexes may help to give an idea of their behaviour, even if a full
understanding will only be possible once each individual morpheme has
been described in the appropriate section below—the sub-script number
relates to the morpheme-slot from the list prešented above:      g-nax-av-en

      'X was starting to sing'      Some more complex examples of the system at work are now prešented.
      Verbs agree not only with just the subject, e.g.

   mo-gv-i-vid-a
   PREV-us-OV-come-X(AOR)
   'X came upon us/we received X'    A verb associated with four external arguments is rare and pushes the
system to its absolute limits, but such forms manifestly cause no difficulty
to the decoder, e.g.   col-ma me        q'ur+ad+g+eb+a              mi-(0-?0-)m-a-kc-ev-in-a

120                           GEORGI AN GRAMMAR   Some verbs that are transitive by virtue of their morphology today lack
an external direct object, no doubt by virtue of loss of the relevant but
predictable noun over time, e.g.      man        mo-(?0-)ps-a
      X(ERG)     PREV-(?3rd.PER-)urinate-X(AOR)
      'X urinated (sc. urine = šard-i/ps+el-i)'    Some such verbs have a non-subject external argument that is actually
the indirect object, e.g.      deda-m         šv+il-s       (?0-)s-cem-a
      mother-ERG child-DAT         (?3rd.PER-)it-hit-she(AOR)
      'the mother hit the child'what she used to hit him being the understood direct object—cf.      bi<5'-i      da-s           zurg-ši tovl-is        gunda-s

      (Ø-)s-druz-av-s
      (it-)her-strike-TS(FUT)-he
      'the lad will strike his sister in the back a heavy blow with a snowball'    The verb just illustrated for the meaning 'hit' is in the process of
becoming a regular transitive, such that today one often hears in place of
the prescriptively correct construction given above the non-standard
deda-m šv+il-i (Ø-)(s2 -)cem-a; another Transitive verb with missing
direct object and thus an indirect object as second argument is:      (mi-/mo-)(0-?0-0-)a-gn-eb
      (PREV-)(you-?3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)lV-locate-TS
      'you (will) locate X/them'and yet the autobiography of Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli contains an example with
the second argument in the Nominative alongside the Aorist Subjunctive,

where, since there no longer seems to be an indirect object governed by
the locative Version, I have glossed the - a - as the Neutral Version (see
below 4.4.1). In the case of a third verb of this type, as seen in the
šentence p'rogres-s mi-(?Ø-Ø-)a-g+c'-i-es 'they attained progress',
one hears constructions like p'rogres-i i-q'+o mi+g+c+e+ul-i 'progress
was made', where the underlying/original indirect object has been raised to
become subject of this analytical passive (in other words, it is treated like
a regular direct object). Ivane Imnaishvili (1971.331-335) lists 23 verbs
which in OldGEORGIANwere Transitives with just external subject and
indirect object but which today have been realigned as normal Transitives,
taking external subject and direct object in the modern language3. The
verb 'call to/summon' conforms to the prescriptive construction for 'hit', viz.   šen šen-s             da-s       da-(0-?0-0-)u-jax-e!

"1.3 The History of Georgian PhilologyThe earliest known work in Georgian to deal with philological issues in the
language, namely A Treatise on Articles, was discovered by Mzekala
Shanidze (1984) as part of the 11th-12th century manuscript No.6 from the
collection of the I veron Monastery on Mt. Athos, a work she tentatively
attributes to the scholar Eprem Mtsire. Sulxan Saba Orbeliani (1658-1725)
produced the first native dictionary in 1716, whilst the first grammar of the
6                         GEORGI AN GRAMMARlanguage written in Georgian belongs to Zurab Shanshovani (1737), followed
in 1753 and 1767 by versions of a more comprehensive description by
Patriarch Ant'on I (1720-1788). A number of grammatical works appeared
through the 19th and early 20th centuries, but it was essentially in the
writings of T h e Father of Modern Georgian Philology', Ak'ak'i Shanidze
(February 1887-March 1987), that Georgian grammar finally came of age.
His monumental Fundamentals of the Georgian Language, most recently re­
printed in 1980, will long remain the ultimate reference for all students of
Georgian morphology once they have gained a reading-knowledge of the
language. The Georgian Academy published the 8-volume Explanatory
Dictionary of the Georgian Language (KEGL, in abbreviation of its native
title, viz. kart+ul-i en-is gan+mart'+eb+it-i leksik'on-i) between
 1950 and 1964 under the general editorship of Arnold Cikobava, who
contributed his own grammatical sketch in volume 1. I ndeed, it has to be
said that the preparation of this grammar was greatly facilitated by the
invaluable information provided by this magnificent work, for apart from
using the volumes to check the existence and morphology of many of the
verb-forms quoted, I made lavish use of the illustrations included in the
various articles consulted, many of which are quoted as presented, though
in other cases I reduced the content for concentration on the feature in
question. Working so intimately with these volumes over the months, I
came to appreciate even more than I had before just how indispensable
they are for any serious student of Georgian. I know that this dictionary
has been the target of a good deal of criticism over the years, but I am
happy to speak strongly in its defence here. It has the unparalleled
advantage over any other dictionary of Georgian in its inclusion of so much
illustrative material from attested usage. One of the great desiderata in
Kartvelology is for a really good bilingual dictionary including illustrative
material of just this kind, and the first step in any such project would
surely be to render the Georgian definitions in KEGL into some appropriate
second language (like English!) and then to publish the result in a single
volume with a greatly reduced size of font on good quality thin paper, after
the fashion of The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary. If such a project
could be financed, at least two observations should be borne in mind: (i) the
long quotes from the published works of Stalin that rather burden volumes
 1-4 could usefully be pruned or replaced, and (ii) since citations are with
3rd person subject (and object(s)), it is not always possible to predict the
form of a verbal root in some paradigms when the subject (or direct object)
is 1st or 2nd person (e.g. given ga-(Ø-)č'r-a 'X cut Y/them', it is not
possible to predict that 'I cut X/them' is ga-v-(Ø-)č'er-i with root
expanded by -e-), so that this information should either be given as part of

in the illustrative materials, which goal KEGL does not always achieve—
see the suggestions along these lines I made in Hewitt (1991a). Without
KEGL whatever value the present volume may have would have been
considerably diminished. Useful articles will also be found in the ongoing
series Questions on the Culture of Georgian Speech, whose 9th volume
appeared in 1989. Numerous dialectal words are contained in the various
volumes of Materials on the History of Georgia's Domestic Industry and
Craftsmanship (in Georgian), which began publication in 1976.
     Foreign investigation of Georgian began in the 17th century with the
work of Italian missionaries—for the history of the study of Caucasian
languages in general see (the Mingrelian) Arnold Chikobava (1965). In 1629
there were published in Rome the Alphabetum Ihericum, sive Georgianum,
cum Oratione Dominicali and S. Paolini's Georgian-Italian Dictionary. In
 1643 M. Maggio followed these with his Georgian Grammar. Facsimiles of
these three bibliographical rarities were published in Tbilisi in 1983 under
the title First Printed Books in Georgian (Xelovneba). F. Bopp, M. Brosset
and H. Schuchardt dealt with aspects of Georgian in the 19th century, and
in 1904 A. Dirr produced his short Theoretisch-praktische Grammatik der
modernen georgischen [grusinischen] Sprache (Leipzig). More recent works
that may be consulted with profit are: G. Deeters Das           kharthwelische
 Verbum (Leipzig, 1930), K. Tschenkéli Einführung in die georgische Sprache
(Zürich, 1958) in two volumes, as well as his             Georgisch-Deutsches
 Wörterbuch in three volumes (1965-1974), which is easily the most
outstanding of any of the bilingual dictionaries currently available, H. Vogt
 Grammaire de la langue géorgienne (Paris, 1971), H. Aronson Georgian—A
Reading Grammar (Chicago, 1982 & 1990)2, H. Fähnrich Kurze Grammatik
der georgischen Sprache (Leipzig, 1986), whilst for Old Georgian there is
this same scholar's 1982 German translation of A. Shanidze's short Grammar
of the Old Georgian Language (both the original (1976) and the translation
published in Tbilisi) as well as in his own right a grammatical sketch of
 1991 and now the monograph Grammatik der altgeorgischen               Sprache
(Hamburg, 1994). My own Georgian: A Learner's Grammar (Routledge,
 1995b) is now available as a self-tutor for English-speaking readers.
     Standing at the intersection of Europe and Asia and occupying an
 important strategic position in the Transcaucasus, Georgia has been
regarded as an attractive prize by more powerful peoples since time
 immemorial. Græco-Roman, Persian, Arabic, Turkish and, latterly, Russian
 influences have all left their traces on the language, especially in respect
of the lexicon. The Academy Dictionary (KEGL) states the provenance of
many foreign lexemes, and in 1964 M. C'abashvili published a dictionary of
8                          GEORGI AN GRAMMARforeign words. The standard reference for Georgian-Iranian linguistic
contacts is the 1966 monograph by Mzia Andronik'ashvili. For Armeno-
Kartvelian contacts see Vogt (1938 & 1988).","[24, 25, 26, 27]"

Notes1   lat'avra Gelenidze's Vocabulary Connected with the Anatomy-Physiology of
    Man in OldGEORGIAN(Tbilisi, 1974, inGEORGIAN)should be consulted by anyone
    interested in the OldGEORGIANvocabulary.
2   Sulxan Saba Orbeliani (1658-1725) gives a rather interesting list of synonyms in his
    dictionary. I quote: 'sk'ore is the general term for the outpassings [ganavaltaj of
    creatures. But that of birds is called sk'int'li, that of fish t'urt'li, that of reptiles
    curcli, that of goats and wild goats k'urk'li, that of cows and water-buffalo nexvi
    and k'eli [N.B. ModernGEORGIANhas both k'eli and nak'elij, that of pigs čxrink'eli,
    that of horses and donkeys čončorik'i, that of dogs and beasts mčore, that of men
    mjgneri, dried excrement c'iva and pune, watery fæces t'rac'i, the droppings of a
    pigeon naedomi.' As for the basic term, is there a connection with Ancient Greek
    skč:r (Genitive skatčs) = latin stercus = Old Norse sklta = Anglo-Saxon scitan =
    English shit?GEORGIANalso uses the word p'at'ivi 'honour, respect' as a synonym
    (?euphemism) for nak'eli, nexvi. Note the play on words in the proverb: mic'a-s
    (Ø-)u-tkv-am-s: p'at'iv-i da-(Ø-Ø-)m-a-q'ar-e da p'at'iv-s da-(Ø-)g-a-q'r-i-
    o The earth apparently said: «Cast dung upon me and I shall cast honour [sc. in terms
    of a fine harvestj on you»'.
3   The preverb c'a- is given by Sulxan Saba Orbeliani, whilst (ga+)k'u+eb+a is given
    by Fähnrich/Sardzhveladze (199Ø). Because it is reminiscent of this verb, the plural of
    k'u 'tortoise' tends to be avoided — hence the attraction above the city of Tbilisi is
    called k'u-s t'ba Tortoise lake' rather than k'u-eb-is t'ba.
4   This verb is defined in Sulxan Saba Orbeliani's dictionary as: k'ac-ta-gan kal-is
    da-m+dab+1-eb-a 'the lowering (sc. corrupting) of a woman by men'. Dee Ann
    Holisky in her 1981 study Aspect andGEORGIANMedial Verbs' quotes (p.75) c'er-s 'X
    screws Y' vs c'er-a-ob-s 'X screws (intransitive)'. This root's non-slang meaning is,
696                              GEORGI AN GRAMMAR
      of course, 'write'. In Mingrelian part of the paradigm of (do-)xod-u-a falls together
      with that of the verb meaning 'sit down'. If in the Present b-xod-un-k is 'I fuck X'
      and b-xod-u-k is 'I sit down', in the Aorist do-b-xod-i should mean both 'I fucked
      X' and 'I sat down'. In fact, there seems to have been an attempt to avoid ambiguity
      by producing a new form for the commoner verb; Q'ipshidze's 1914 grammar quotes
      ko-do-do-b-xod-i as an alternative for the meaning 'I sat down', where, apart from
      the affirmative prefix ko-, the normal preverb has been reduplicated. When I myself
      was examining this verb some years ago in Ochamchira, one informant gave me the
      following paradigm: do-b-xod-u-k 'I sit down' vs (ks-)do-b-do-xod-u-k 'I shall sit
      down' vs (ke-)do-b-do-xod-i 'I sat down' vs the inverted do-m-Q-)xun(-u) 'I have
      sat down'. What seems to be happening is that, as is generally more common in
      Mingrelian than Georgian, the preverb is not restricted to the non-Present, so that the
      Present here begins with the root's normal preverb. In addition to the affirmative
      prefix, both the Future and Aorist shew reduplication of the normal preverb but with
      the difference from the form given by Q'ipshidze that the inner preverb has fused with
      the root, forcing the subject-marker to follow one instance of the preverb but precede
      the second.
5     Expressions for 'dying' (specifically 'the woman died') include the following: kal-i mo-
      k'vd-a = kal-i garda-i-cval-a = kal-ma sul-i gan-(0-?0-)u-t'ev-a (lit. X gave
      up the soul') = kal-ma c'er+il-i c'a-(0-)i-g-o (lit. 'X took the letter') = kal-ma
      sul-i da-(0-)l-i-a (lit. 'X drank the soul') = kal-s sul-i a-mo-(0-)xd-a.

"3.8.1 Pseudo-interjections
Three terms of endearment/affection, used especially by older to younger
people or, in the case of the first two, by lovers are: šen-i č ir-i-me, g-
e-na+cva(l-e), and g-e-taq'va(n-e). The last (in its full guise) is an
Aorist verb-form meaning 'I worshipped you', the second an Aorist meaning
'I substituted for you', and the first comes from a full expression of the
type:      šen-i   č   ir-i      me       še-m-e-q'ar-o-s
      your-AGR woe-NOM me(DAT) PREV-me-IOV-t:ast.upon-AOR.SUBJ-it
      'may your woe be cast upon me'(sc. 'may I take over your suffering and relieve you of it', which, of course,
is the basic šentiment of g-e-na+cva(l-e) too <= na+cval-i 'substitute').
Similar also is the verb-form še-mo-g-e-vl-e (literally) 'I encircled/went
round you', referring either to actual movement round the person or to a
symbolic circling movement of the hand over the person's chest, both

"Examples:
i. The set depicts loud, irritating crying of children, ugly and open-
mouthed:
   ǰgav-i-s indicates the loudest, lowest (not piercing) sound-production
     vs
     čxav-i-s which stands between the former and the following, being
     piercing and coarser than the following vs
     č'q'av-1-s which is highest, piercing and sharpii. The two depict quiet, indistinct grumbling in an irritated, unhappy tone
of voice, usually implying discontent:
    burdgun-eb-s is the lower, more prolonged, continuous sound vs
    burt'q'un-eb-s which is higher with less talking, perhaps more sudden,
    as when blurting something outiii. The two depict sobbing, usually of children or very young teenagers:
     zlukun-eb-s is the lower, louder, stronger, more involved vs
     sluk'un-eb-s which is higher and softerFor the effect stemming from a change of vowel we take:i.   The set depicts irritated, angry complaining or scolding:
     ǰuǰgun-eb-s suggests the lowest, softest sound-production vs
     ǰfǰgin-eb-s which is higher and louder vs
                                    SOUND SYSTEM                                        31    ǰaǰgan-eb-s which is the loudest of the set with the subject angriestii. The two depict innocent, sweet, soft talking, with pleasant connotations:
    t'ut'un-eb-s is the lower representation, used both of children and
    adults vs
    t'it'in-eb-s has the suggestion of higher pitch, used only of children    All these examples come from Holisky and Kaxadze (1986.188), and on
the same page they exemplify a similar phenomenon resulting from
alteration of the place of articulation of (in this case) one consonant, the
manner of articulation being kept constant, viz.i. The two verbs depict indistinct muttering, involving bumpy, jerky
talking, with unpleasant connotations:
    bluq'un-eb-s conveys a lower pitch of sound vs
    bluk'un-eb-s which suggests a higher pitchCompare this parallel for a consonant-complex from Holisky (1981.123-124):ii. dgrial-eb-s make noise, thunder vs
    tkrial-eb-s rattle, rush, make noise of horses' hooves vs
    tVrial-eb-s laugh (of someone full of emotion, like a young girl)Notes1   This would appear to be one of those roots with Thematic Suffix -ob which ends in
    - v . Such roots are normally weak in the Aorist Indicative, which is to say that the
    indicative vowel -e is used when the subject is 1st or 2nd person, and the radical
    fricative re-appears before this ending. The present root is anomalous in being strong
    (i.e. having the indicative vowel -i) and expanding the root for the first two persons,
    such that the fricative does not appear. However, it reappears with the 3rd person
    plural in the Aorist Indicative and is present in the verb's Perfect form.
2   Are these verbs back-formations with Thematic Suffix -eb from the Aorist in -i(v) of
    the relevant roots plus the Thematic Suffix -ev ? If so, the i-vowel will not originally
    have been part of the root. In the case of a-p'at'i-eb 'you forgive X/them Y/them'
    the full nominal form of the root is seen in p'at'iv-i 'honour, respect', from which the
    -v- is lost between the vowels in the denominative verb.
3   Such zero-morphemes were not indicated in any verb-form quoted earlier in this
    chapter.
3    Non-verbal Morphology3.0 Structure of the chapterThe non-verbal parts of speech will be described in the following order:
Nouns, Adjectives (including numerals), Adverbs, Postpositions, Pronouns,
Particles, Conjunctions, Interjections, Derivational Morphology, and
Acronyms.","[49, 50, 51, 52]"
"    In the šense of 'only just VERB' the particle ogond (with variants
ogond k'i, ogonda-c) is used with the Imperative (see next section for its
use in wishes), e.g.      ogond ga-mo-(Ø-)di                         mand-e+dan,            da
      just     PREV-PREV-(you-)come.out(I MPER) there-from              and

      everything-NOM order-on       PASS-be-TS-it(FuT)      'Only just come out of there, and everything will be in order'5.1.16 Wishes
The subjunctive (Prešent, Aorist, or sometimes, as an alternative to the
latter, the Future) is used, depending on aspect, sometimes accompanied by
the particles dae and net'av 'would that' (cf. 3.6.7); the old, generally
defunct optative particle -mc(a), which originally accompanied an
indicative verb, is also sometimes found with such subjunctives (cf. 3.6.14).
The IIIrd Subjunctive also occurs in wishes, particularly on formal
occasions, such as in toasts, e.g.      q'vel+gan m+sopl+i+o-ši          da-mq'ar-eb-ul-i-q'-o-s

"5.1.2 The Adnominal Genitive (cf. 3.1.1)
In ModernGEORGIANadnominal Genitives usually precede their head-nouns
(e.g. saxl-is k'edel-i houšGEN        wall-NOM 'the wall of the house', rtul-i
st'rukt'ur-is zmna complex-AGR structure-GEN verb(NOM) 'a verb of
complex structure'). In OldGEORGIANthis order was reversed, and the
older sequence is not unknown even today, most naturally when the head-
noun stands in the Nominative or Dative. In such cases the Genitive takes
its long form (e.g. k'edel-i saxl-isa). The reason for this is that in the
ancient language the c a š e n d i n g of the head was repeated at the end of
the NP (giving in this particular example k'edel-i saxl-isa-y). Because
the palatal semi-vowel has disappeared, the nature of this structure is
536                           GEORGIANGRAMMARobscured, but when the head-noun is Dative, the Dative ending can stIII be
repeated on the following Genitive (e.g. k'edel-s saxl-isa(-s)). Though
the modern examples of such reduplication are not unknown when the
head-noun is Vocative, Ergative and Adverbial, they have a distinctly
archaic flavour. However, there is one circumstance where this possibility
of double c a š m a r k i n g is fully utilised today, regardless of which c a š
marker follows the Genitive, and this is where the head-noun is gapped, e.g.      čem-i     važ+i+šv(+)il-is      kc+ev+a-m           ga-m-a-oc-a,
      my-AGR    son-GEN               behaviour-ERG       PREV-me-NV-amaze-
                                                                        it(AOR)
      kal+i+šv(+)il-isa-m     k'i         ara
      daughter-GEN-ERG        however not
      'My son's behaviour amazed me, but not that of my daughter'    The end-sequence -GEN-DAT (-isa-s) when associated with a verbal
noun (theGEORGIANMasdar—cf. 5.1.5) functions as a reduced temporal
clause 'at the time of VERBing', being a short-hand version of the Masdar
in the Genitive dependent upon dro-s time-DAT 'at the time (sc. of
VERBing)' (e.g. ezo-ši š e - s v l - i s a - s / / š s v l - i s dro-s yard-into PREV-
enter(MASD)-GEN-DAT//PREV-enter(MASD)-GEN                              time-DAT 'at the
moment of entering the yard'). This same construction is found with
ordinary nouns which, while not formally masdars, have a sort of verbal
force (e.g. masal-is analiz-isa-s material-GEN analysis-GEN-DAT 'while
analysing the material').","[554, 555]"

                               PREFACE
This work began with the aim, consistent with the general goal of the
Benjamin-SOAS series of which it is a part, of presenting the essential
structural characteristics of Georgian for the benefit of general linguists.
As it progressed, however, it turned into something more than this. It had
been my aim to write a reference grammar of Georgian after a further ten
years or so of study, but the request from the Series' editors, Professor
Thea Bynon and Professor Matt Shibatani, to contribute a description of
Georgian happened to coincide with an unforeseen rift in my relations with
Georgia which is unlikely to be repaired. And so, rather than continue to
study this language, to which I was introduced seriously in 1975 when I
travelled to Tbilisi as a Cambridge post-graduate student for a year of
intensive learning on a British Council exchange, as, now of necessity for
me, a virtual dead language, I decided that it was time to kill three birds
with one stone. In marshalling here the sum total of the knowledge that I
have acquired over the last twenty years I hope (a) to have satisfied the
faith placed in my ability by Professors Bynon and Shibatani to write a
grammar of use for the general linguist, (b) to have produced a worthwhile
reference-grammar (the first in English) that it had always been my desire
to compose, and (c) to end thereby the period when Georgian has
represented the main focus of my study and research. If I succeed in
easing even a few people's passage through the waiting mysteries, I shall
conclude the last 20 years to have been well spent.
                            CORRIGENDUMThe Georgian for 'you (will) seat (plural) X' is (da-)sx-am, and not (da-)a-sx-
am, as given throughout this work. The latter form does exist but in the
meaning 'you (will) seat (plural) X on Y', which is to say that the pre-radical
a-vowel functions fully as exponent of the Locative Version. The verb-form
(da-)a-sx-am may, of course, also mean 'you (will) pour (liquid) X'.
                      ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
During the two academic years (1975-76, 1979-80) I spent with The British
Council in Tbilisi as well as in the course of other trips, such as my 3-
month sabbatical there at the end of 1987 through the auspices of The
British Academy, I came to know many Georgians, Mingrelians and Svans
whom I regarded as dear friends and from whom I learned a great deal
about Georgian and Georgia, whether or not they were conscious of their
role as teachers! Under normal circumstances I would have been happy to
list them all in the expectation that it might have gratified them to see their
names in such a book. However, circumstances have changed, and, since I
would not wish to embarrass anyone, I shall merely say that my gratitude
remains undimmed and that any Kartvelian who is still interested in
receiving thanks from me may consider themselves included in this
anonymous list.
     Dr. Rieks Smeets (Leiden University) was kind enough to read an early
draft of chapter 5 and offer some helpful comments thereon. Thea Bynon's
advice was, as anyone who knows her would naturally expect, especially
valuable. Professor Donald Rayfield (Queen Mary Westfield, London
University) cast his experienced eye over the whole manuscript and was a
source of constant encouragement during the preparation of the work.
Mrs. Joyce Hutchinson exhibited great patience in bringing the text into
conformity with the requirements of the publishers, and SOAS was kind
enough to support this publication by generously reimbursing her for so
doing. Mrs. Catherine Lawrence of SOAS' Department of Geography
enthusiastically made her skills available by drawing the map for this
volume. And finally without the understanding of my long-suffering wife,
Zaira, and daughters, Amra and Gunda, for my almost umbilical attachment
to the computer-console while this book was gestating, its birth would have
been considerably delayed. I thank all concerned and alone take the blame
for any mistakes outstanding.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16]"

"3.1.1 Consonant-final noun-stems
The declension of a typical consonant-final noun k'ac-i 'man' is set out,
followed by necessary comments.
    The thorough-going agglutination of the modern declensional pattern
was matched only in the Nominative and Vocative of Old Georgian, where,
however, the plural morpheme had a different morphic exponent; in the
oblique cases Old Georgian employed only the synthetic -t(a), which is but
rarely attested, if at all, in the Instrumental and Adverbial cases.

be said other than that four of them clearly exist in two forms, possessing
both short and long variants. In essence the long form is a positionally
determined variant of the short form, required, for example, in sequences
before monosyllables such as da 'and', e.g.     k'ac-sa da kal-s
     man-DAT and woman-DAT
     'to the man and the woman'
     tbilis-isa      da kutais-is        si+lamaz+e
     Tbilisi-GEN and Kutaisi-GEN beauty(NOM)
     'the beauty of Tbilisi and Kutaisi'
     čibux-ita da p'ap'iros-it
     pipe-INST and cigarette-INST
     'with/by pipe and cigarette'
     briq'v-ada da maimun-ad
     idiot-ADV       and monkey-ADV
     'as an idiot and monkey'    If, for stylistic reasons, an adnominal Genitive is placed after its head-
noun, as was the normal order in Old Georgian, the long form is again
employed (e.g. kutais-is si+lamaz+e vs si+lamaz+e kutais-isa 'the
beauty of Kutaisi')—cf. 5.I.2.
    According to the pattern set out above the case-desinences are merely
added to the stem, and this pattern is followed by all consonant-stem nouns
with two exceptions: (i) the Vocative of proper-names is simply the bare
stem itself (e.g. zurab! 'Zurab!', elizabed! 'Elizabeth!'); (ii) some nouns
(including some vowel-stems—see 2.2.4.2) undergo vowel-syncope within the
root. Syncope primarily applies to the vowels -a- and -e- in the Genitive,
Instrumental and Adverbial cases of the singular plus all the cases in the
modern plural. The examples are of gutan-i 'plough' and c'el-i 'year':

syncope operating, hard and fast rules are elusive—for example, tval-i
'eye' does not syncopate (= Genitive tval-is(a)), whereas for the meaning
'precious stone' it does syncopate (= Genitive tvl-is(a)). One can do no
better than quote Vogt (1971:2Iff.), who gives the following observations
(abbreviated here): The phonemic structure of the stem does not permit
one to see whether the stem is stable or syncopating. The stem of kal-i
'woman' is stable, that of bal-i 'cherry' syncopating. Some stable stems
become syncopating as second term of a compound. The stem of kal-i
remains stable (e.g. sepe+kal-i 'princess', Genitive sepe+kal-is(a)), but
the stem of k'ar-i 'door', which is stable (Genitive k'ar-is(a)), undergoes
vocalic alterations in compounds (e.g. c+is+k'ar-i 'dawn', Genitive
c+is+k'r-isia))... In certain instances one may suppose that the absence
of syncope is due to phonemic [phonotactic?—BGH] factors... m-k'vd-ar-i
'dead person' has the Genitive m-k'vd-r-is(a), but... m-tvr-a1-i 'drunk
person' has the Genitive m-tvr-al-is(a). The form *m-tvr-l-is(a) would
be tolerable only with difficulty in the system...
     'Alternance a / 0 . In monosyllabic stems vocalic syncope is exceptional
if the beginning of the stem is a simple consonant... Monosyllables which in
anlaut have a consonantal group are in general syncopated, unless
factors of phonemic structure are against it... We thus have... mt'k'var-i
36                         GEORGI AN GRAMMAR'(Tbilisi's river) Kura' [Genitive mt'k'vr-isia)]... As exceptions one can
mention... k'val-i 'track, trace' [Genitive k'val-is(a)], svan-i 'Svan person'
[Genitive svan-is(a)]... In polysyllabic stems (Georgian or of foreign
origin, especially Arabo-Persian), even in recent borrowings from Indo-
European languages, syncope is the rule if the final consonant of the stem
is a sonant. With final -an we have for example ak'van-i 'cradle'
(Genitive ak'vn-is(a)), bat'k'an-i 'lamb' (Genitive bat'k'n-is(a))... With
final -am for example at'am-i 'peach' (Genitive at'm-is(a))..., katam-i
'chicken' [Genitive katm-is(a)]. With final -al for example dedal-i
'female (of animal)' (Genitive dedl-is(a))... With final ~ar for example
bazar-i 'market' (Genitive bazr-is(a))... With final -av for example
k'arav-i 'tent' (Genitive k'arv-is(a))... In participle[-derived] stems in -av
the stem is generally stable (e.g. sa-nax-av-i 'something to be seen',
Genitive sa-nax-av-is(a), u-nax-av-i 'something unseen', Genitive u -
nax-av-is(a)). Stems whose final consonant is other than a sonant are
 generally stable, but syncope is probably the rule in araq'-i 'vodka'
[Genitive arq'-is(a)], nabad-i 'shepherd's felt-cloak' [Genitive n a b d -
 is(a)]...
     'Alternance e / 0 . The conditions of syncope are in the main the same
 as in the preceding instances. Monosyllabic words with consonant-initial
 do not syncopate... with the exception of c'el-i 'year', Genitive c'l-is(a).
 Words with initial consonantal group may have syncope (e.g. mgel-i 'wolf',
 Genitive mgl-is(a), equally... mgvdel-i 'priest' [Genitive mgvdl-is(a)],...
 c'ven-i 'juice' [Genitive c'vn-is(a)]), but without syncope [are] gvel-i
 'snake' [Genitive gvel-is(a)], mc'er-i 'insect' [Genitive mc'er-is(a)],
 sxven-i 'attic' [Genitive sxven-is(a)].... The words ber-i 'monk' and per-
 i 'colour' are with stable stem according to rule, but syncope is the rule in
 the derivative beber-i 'old woman' [Genitive bebr-is(a)]... and in the
 numerous compounds like... q'vela+per-i 'everything' [Genitive q'vela+pr-
 is(a)].
      'In polysyllabic stems with sonant final syncope is the rule with
 restrictions of a phonemic order signalled (e.g... ševarden-i 'falcon'
 [Genitive ševardn-is(a)], mzitev-i 'dowry' [Genitive mzitv-is(a)]. The
 numerous participial derivatives in m(a)- -el-i, sa—el-i, and u- -el-i
 in general have syncope, but syncope does not take place if the suffix is
 preceded by the sonant -v- (final of the present stem). Family-names with
 -el-i in general are syncopated (e.g.. c'eretel-i [Genitive c'eretl-is(a)]),
 but for nouns designating origin there is much fluctuation. One has imer-
 el-i'Imeretian (person), Genitive imer-l-is(a), beside k'ax-el-i 'Kaxetian
 (person)', Genitive k'ax-el-isia), kart+v-el-i 'Georgian (person)',
 Genitive kart+v-el-is(a). Nouns introduced more recently are in general
                          NON-VERBAL MORPHOLOGY                              37without syncope (e.g... inglis-el-i 'English (person)', Genitive inglis-el-
is(a)). With final consonant other than a sonant syncope is met only in the
words beč'ed-i 'ring' [Genitive beč'd-is(a)], somex-i 'Armenian (person)'
[Genitive somx-is(a)].'
     In addition there are the straightforward irregularities like ambav-i
'news, report', which has Genitive amb-is(a) (cf. Nominative plural amb-
eb-i), and gmert-i 'god', which has Genitive gvt-is(a), although the
regular gmert-is(a) is also found.
     The vowel -o- in polysyllabic stems is also susceptible to syncope,
though this vowel does not disappear altogether, unless it follows a labial
consonant or the preceding syllable contains the vowel -o-, but rather
reduces to -v-. The first illustration is of the noun mac'on-i 'yoghurt':   Case               Singular              Plural            Old Plural

"4.8.2.2 The Causative of Semelfactives Derived from Medials
The use of a preverb in the perfective screeves with a basically Medial
verb-form indicates a one-off, semelfactive occurrence of the verbal
action. By using that preverb with the Medial's (pseudo-)Causative we
causativise the semelfactive, as in:                            (Ø-)q'vir-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-q,vir-eb          'you
(will) yell' => (Ø-Ø-)a-q'vir-eb 'you (will) get X/them to yell' vs da-(Ø-?
Ø-)i-q'vir-eb 'you will let out a yell' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-q'vir-eb 'you (will)
get X/them to let out a yell'.                        (Ø-)suntk-av/(Ø-?Ø-)i-suntk-eb                   'you
(will) breathe' => (Ø-Ø-)a-suntk-eb 'you (will) get X/them to breath' vs (a-
m o - ) ( Ø - ? Ø - ) i - s u n t k - e b 'you (will) breathe out' => (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-
s u n t k - e b 'you (will) get X/them to breathe out', for which the full
Causative (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-suntk-eb-in-eb (or even (a-mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-
suntk-v-in-eb) may serve as synonym, ara+vin                                            č'aš'an-eb-s/(?Ø-)i-
č ' a č ' a n - e b - s 'no-one is/will be somewhere' => ara+vi-s                                  (Ø-Ø-)a-
š'ač'an-eb 'you (will) allow no-one to be somewhere' vs ara+vin ga-
(?Ø-)i-č""ač'an-eb-s 'no-one will put in an appearance somewhere' =>
ara+vi-s ga-(Ø-Ø-)a-č'ač'an-eb 'you (will) allow no-one to put in an
appearance somewhere'.
      These examples are not easy to find, for with a number of verbs there
seems to be no great difference between the expected semelfactive
meaning resulting from coupling a preverb with the Medial verb-form and
an inceptive šense. For example, there is no formal inceptive cognate for
(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb 'you (will) laugh', but the preverbal ga-
(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb is glossed by KEGl as 'you will start to laugh', and so
the corresponding (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-cin-eb is glossed as 'you will cause
X/them to laugh, bring laughter to X/them, get X/them to burst out
laughing' (vs (Ø-Ø-)a-cin-eb 'you (will) get X/them to laugh'). In the case
of ( Ø - ( Ø - ) ) l a p , a r a k , - o b / ( Ø - ? Ø - ) i - l a p , a r a k , - e b 'you (will) speak
(something)' we do have a formal inceptive (namely (a-)(Ø-)lap'arak'-d-
eb-i 'you (will) start to speak') to which the Causative is (a-)(Ø-Ø-)a-
lap'arak'-eb 'you (will) get X/them to start speaking'. In contrast we
422                         GEORGIANGRAMMARhave the formal semelfactive da-(Ø-?Ø-)i-lap , arak'-eb, but this is
glossed in virtually the same way as a-(Ø-)lap'arak'-d-eb-i, namely
'begin speaking, give voice, say something, start into speech'. However, the
formally equivalent Causative is (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-lap'arak'-eb, which is
glossed as: 'you (will) give someone the opportunity to speak, get someone
to give voice, allow someone to speak with someone' (e.g. ar-c k'i da-
(Ø-)a-lap'arak'-a 'X didn't even allow Y/them to speak', which, however,
is possibly better interpreted semelfactively as 'didn't allow the saying of
even a word' than inceptively as 'didn't allow to start speaking'). Similarly
for one of the examples in KEGl, namely:      ro+gor ga-(?Ø-)i-xar-eb-d-a,                                   rom

a little (sc. in order to shew that the power of speech has returned)', but
perhaps we are here being overly precious in trying to detect semantic
subtleties.","[440, 441]"
"1.2 The Georgian ScriptsGeorgian is unique amongst not only the Kartvelian languages but also the
38 or so autochthonous languages of the Caucasus as a whole in possessing
an unbroken literary tradition of some 15 centuries; though some attempts
were made in the 19th century to establish scripts for other indigenous
languages in the region, those that today have literary status in the former
USSR really only gained this in any meaningful sense following the
establishment of Soviet power. Two legends are associated with the
creation of the Georgian script—(a) that it was devised by King Parnavaz
in the 4th/3rd centuries B.C., (b) that Armenian Bishop Mesrop Mashtots
invented it c.400 A.D. along with the Armenian script and that of the «lost»
Caucasian Albanians. Most, however, would concur that it was probably
created some time in the 4th century (Ts'ereteli 1960), on the model of
contemporary Greek (Gamq'relidze 1989), in order to facilitate the spread
of Christianity, introduced in the 330s. The earliest inscription dates from
C.430 at the Georgian church founded by Peter the Iberian in the Judaean
desert near Bethlehem; within Georgia the oldest inscription hails from 494
at the Bolnisi Sion (60 kilometres to the south from Tbilisi).
    During its history Georgian has had three scripts, all written from left
to right and lacking the distinction between upper and lower cases: (a) from
the 5th to the 9th century mrg(v)lovani          'rounded' (otherwise called
asomtavruli     'majiscule') was used; (b) from this developed       k'utxovani
'angular' (or nusxuri 'miniscule'), which, having made its first appearance in
the testament appended to the Sinai Polycephalon of 864, continued to be
used for most manuscripts written in the 10th/11th centuries—within such
manuscripts the earlier script was employed in the function of capitals; (c)
the modern mxedruli 'military, secular' script evolved from its predecessor
in the 11th century. However, the Church continued to use the older scripts
for sacred texts, such that the generic term xucuri 'ecclesiastical' came to
be adopted jointly to distinguish them from their mutual descendant. The
modern script has 33 characters and is fully phonemic; Old Georgian used
5 additional characters, which are bracketed in their mxedruli-forms in the
table that follows:

"     Given two sets of pronominal agreement-affixes, the subject usually
selects its marker from Set A, whilst the object is shewn by a Set B affix
(e.g. m-nax-av-s meB-see-TS-XA(FUT) 'X will see me'), whereas in part of
a transitive verb's set of paradigms and for certain verbs throughout their
conjugation the subject selects its marker from Set B, whilst the object is
indicated by a Set A affix (e.g. ar m-i-nax-av-s not I B - O V - s e e -

be(PRES) 'I have you').
     Any individual verb-form will be classifiable as (i) Transitive, (ii)
Intransitive (passive), (iii) Medial, (iv) Indirect, (v) Stative. Whilst a single
root does not normally manifest all five types, let us take the root e'er in
an attempt to illustrate each of them: (i) (Ø-Ø-)c'er (you-X-)write(PRES)
'you write X/them', (ii) i-c'er-eb-a PASS-write-TS-X(PRES)           'X is being

the Prešent Sub-Series], Future Indicative, Future Subjunctive and

incorporates just the Aorist Indicative (or Simple Past) and Aorist
Subjunctive (called by some 'Optative'); Series 111 contains the Perfect

fundamental for the tripartite distinction in the morpho-syntactic marking
of subject and object of Transitive (and Medial) verbs discussed
morphologically in 4.7.1.3 and 4.7.3 as well as syntactically in 5.1.7, but also
facilitates the description of the morphological patterning of the various
sub-types of verb.
     Roots are normally associated with one or more preverbs, which
typically appear(s) in aspectually perfective forms 6 (which in gross terms
may be taken to mean screeves other than those of the Prešent Sub-Series,
though there are exceptions predominantly with preverbless Series 11
formations). A problem is that, apart from with verbs of motion, it is almost
always impossible to predict which preverb(s) a given root will select. Also
the lexical meaning to be assigned to a particular verb-form is often a
function not just of the root but of the union of root with this or that
preverb (some other concomitant changes, such as to the Thematic Suffix
or Version vowel, may also occur). Examples: out of the basic root c'er we
can produce such Future Indicatives as: (i) da-(Ø-)c'er-s PREV-(Y-)write-
X'X will write (Y)', (ii) mi-(Ø-)s-c'er-s PREV-(Y-)Z-write.to-X 'X will write

     'we shall put a cover over the wine storage-jar'     The formation of screeves for Transitive and Intransitive Verbs will be
given according to a division based on Thematic Suffix—roots which do not
accommodate a Thematic Suffix are called Root Verbs, though one might
equally style them Athematic.
     Sometimes a change of preverb does not alter the lexical meaning of
the verbal complex but introduces a special nuance. For example, the
preverb da- often substitutes for a root's usual preverb if some notion of
plurality is involved, most simply seen in the following example where a
singular subject is replaced with a plural, viz. k'vercx-i ga-laq'-d-a
egg-NOM PREV-addled-become-it(AOR)            'the egg became addled' vs
k'vercx-eb-i da-laq'-d-a egg-Pl-NOM                 PREV-addled-become-
3rd.PER(AOR)       'the eggs became addled'. In the following case the
replacement-preverb reduces the effect of the verbal action, viz. k'ar-i
ga-v-(Ø-)a-g-e door-NOM PREV-I-(it-)NV-open-INDIC(AOR) 'I opened
the door' vs k'ar-i še-v-(Ø-)a-g-e 'I opened the door ajar', cf. kal-i
ga-suk-d-a woman-NOM PREV-fat-becomeshe(AOR)             'the woman grew
fat' vs kal-i mo-suk-d-a 'the woman put on a little weight'.
     Suppletion exists. It may be determined by (a) screeve (Sub-)Series (e.g.
v-(Ø-)amb-ob I-(X-)say-TS(PRES) 'I say X' vs v-(Ø-)i-t'q'v-i I-(X-)SV-
say-lNDlC(FUT) 'I shall say X' vs v-(Ø-)tkv-i I-(X-)say-INDIC(AOR) 'I
said X'—sometimes alteration to a verb's classification combines with
suppletion as in the case of what is formally the Intransitive Prešent ra-s
(Ø-Ø-)Svr-eb-i? what?-DAT (you-it-)do-TS-INDIC(PRES) 'what are you
doing?' becoming the Transitive Future ra-s (Ø-Ø-)i-zam? what?-DAT
(you-it-)SV-do(FUT) 'what will you do?' or again the Transitive Aorist ra
(Ø-Ø-)ken-i? what(NOM) (you-it-)do-INDIC(AOR) 'what did you do?';
alternatively we can illustrate a shift from Indirect verb in the Prešent

     'the/a child is lying on the bed'   With bivalent Intransitive Verbs sometimes it is the Nominative
argument which corresponds to the subject, e.g.     q'vela    a+ma-s        (Ø-)e-c'ina+ag+m+deg-eb-a

     'everyone opposes this'
126                         GEORGIANGRAMMARwhereas at other times it is the Dative nominal which fulfils this function,

     woman-DAT child-NOM along (she-)IOV-have-TS-it(FUT)
     'the woman will have her child with her'     Occasionally one and the same verb-form permits both interpretations
(e.g. the Nominative is the subject of the first verb in this proverb:      zgva-s    (Ø-)e-rid-eb-od-a,               cvar-ma

      you(DAT) not(PROH) (PREV-)you-I OV-be.shy-TS-X(PRES)
      'don't you be shy (sc. of doing X)!')   Some formally intransitive (deponent) verb-forms are construed with
what appears to be a direct object, e.g.      e + s xe            k ' a r g vašl-eb-s          (?0-)i-jl-ev-a

      'the girl and boy were swearing to each other their love'    If such verb-forms exist in Series II, where a normal direct object
would stand in the Nominative, whilst the indirect object remains Dative,
prescriptive grammar (to which speech does not always conform—see 5.1.7)
requires that such nominals remain Dative, e.g.      mo+nadir+e     mgvdel-s      mo-(?Ø-Ø-)u-q'v-a

   'the hunter related to the priest his own adventure'    Some verb-forms are formally two-person Intransitives though
monovalent by virtue of being construed with only a single Nominative
argument. This state of affairs characterises Series I and II, but, if the
verb possesses forms for the Series 111 screeves, these often revert to
being formally monopersonal, e.g.   pr+in+v+el-i mic'a-ze               ga-(?0-)e-rtx-m-eb-a /

   'the bird will flop/flopped/has flopped down on the ground'    Sometimes not all screeves exist for a given type of verb. In these
cases either a gap exists or the missing screeve is filled by a variant-form
of the root in question; alternatively, suppletion might occur. These
together with all the other morphological particularities and peculiarities of
theGEORGIANverbal system will be described later in this chapter.
128                          GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.1 Pronominal         agreement-affixesThe two sets of agreement-affixes, with the hyphen shewing their position
relative to the stem, are now prešented. The affixes are pronominal in
function and are prešent whether or not the NPs, possibly consisting of just
a personal pronoun, with which they correlate appear within the clause as
external arguments. As an absolute minimum aGEORGIANverb-form must
contain at least one Set A affix in addition to the root:Affixai Agreement-Set A

in all screeves, whilst for Transitives and Medišis they mark the subject
for the various screeves of Series I and 11 —what happens in Series 111 for
Transitives and Medišis and with Indirect verbs in general will be
described later. l e t us take as model of an Intransitive verb the passive
stem -i-k'vl-eb- 'be killed' (consisting of the Subjective Version vowel in
its role as passive-marker followed by the root followed by a Thematic
Suffix) and illustrate subject-marking in the Prešent, Future and Aorist

      'I am being killed'       'I shall be killed'            'I was killed'    We see that with no preverb, as in the Prešent, the subject pronominal
affix of the 1st person stands first in the complex, preceding any pre-
radical vowel that may be used, whereas it follows any preverb(s) that may
be prešent. If the subject is plural, then the pluralising exponent -t is
added at the end of the complex, to give:

the 2nd person equivalents to the above are (with the pluralising suffix in
brackets):   Prešent                    Furure                     Aorist

   'you are being killed'     'you will be killed'       'you were killed'    Which of the various allomorphs for marking 3rd person subjects is
actually selected depends on the screeve and/or type of verb involved, as
will be explained as each type is described in detail below. The 3rd person
equivalents to the above are:   Prešent                     Future                     Aorist
   i-k'vl-eb-a                 mo-i-k'vl-eb-a             mo-i-k'1-a

   'they are being killed'     'they will be killed'      'they were killed'    If we take the root 'kill' but this time as part of a transitive stem, we
can demonstrate subject-marking for a Transitive verb—the prešence of
the zero-morph from the Set B affixal set in the following verb-forms points
to the prešence of a 3rd person direct object (singular or plural):   Prešent                   Future                     Aorist

impose its plurality on the verb is attested in the Memoirs of the great

prescriptively the plurality of such 3rd person direct objects is never

   'X kills them'            'X will kill them'          'X killed them'    The affixes are seen to occupy the same positions relative to the other
exponents as do the affixes of Set A. Where both the 3rd person singular
subject-suffix and the direct object pluraliser are prešent, they occur in
this order (as in the sequence -a-t here from the Aorist). But where the
expected sequence is -s-t (as in earlier forms ofGEORGIANwe would here
have had (mo-)g-k'l-av-s-t 'X kills (will kill) you PI.'), the Set A subject-
suffix is deleted. As to the number of the 3rd person object, it is left to
the context to determine whether forms like (Ø-)k'l-av-s etc.. are
construed with a singular or plural direct object.
    We now have to consider how this picture is complicated when
combinations other than with 3rd person singular subject occur. Assuming
that a subject-prefix would indeed precede a direct object-prefix, the
sequence of v - g - anticipated for a meaning like 'I kill you' is never
realised because the subject-affix is dropped before the object-marker
-g-, viz.

'I kill/shall kill/killed you Pl.', where the pluraliser is part of the 2nd person
exponent from Set B, or (ii) 'we kill/shall kill/killed you', where the
pluraliser is part of the 1st person exponent from Set A, or (iii) 'we
kill/shall kill/killed you Pl"", where an expected final sequence of -t-t has
been simplified by loss of one of the dentals but it is unclear which one—in
the Prešent and Future the forms here may have as a fourth reading the
one given earlier, namely 'X kills/will kill you Pl', which arises out of the
loss of - s - from Set A when followed by -t.
     There are no problems with combinations of 2nd person subject and 1st
person direct object, e.g.      (Ø-)m-k'l-av           mo-(Ø-)m-k'l-av               mo-(Ø-)m-k'al-i
      'you kill me'          'you will kill me'            'you killed me'

      'you Pl kill us'       'you Pl will kill us'         'you Pl killed us'    Similarly there are no problems with the combinations of 3rd person
plural subject with (i) 1st person singular or plural and (ii) 2nd person
singular direct objects, e.g.      m-k'1-av-en             mo-m-k'l-av-en               mo-m-k'1-es
      'they kill me'          'they will kill me'          'they killed me'
      gv-k'1-av-en            mo-gv-k'1-av-en              mo-gv-k'1-es
      'they kill us'          'they will kill us'          'they killed us'
      g-k'1-av-en             mo-g-k'1-av-en               mo-g-k'1-es
      'they kill you'         'they will kill you'         'they killed you'    However, since the pluraliser -t may not stand after any of the 3rd
person plural allomorphs -(a/e)n/es/nen of Set A, the forms in the last

singular or plural.
    This brings us to the marking of indirect objects. The Set B affixes are
again employed, except that now the alternative allomorphs for the 3rd
person come into play according to the rule prešented in 2.2.7, namely: the
base- (=historically oldest) morph h- assimilates to s- when immediately
followed by any of -c, -c', - j , -č, -č', - j , -t, -t', -d, being retained as
h - before -k, -k', -g, -q', - p ' 1 3 ; before other consonants or a vowel the
zero-allophone is used. However, if until around the 2nd World War the
allophones s-, h- were still possible between 1st person subject-marker v-
and the root-initial consonant (e.g. mi-v-s-c'er 'I shall write to X/them',
v-h-q'v-eb-i 'I follow X/them'), today this is in general no longer true, so
that these examples would now be rendered respectively as: mi-v-c'er,
v-q'v-eb-i. Examples are from the Future Indicative forms of the
Transitive verb 'write to' and of the Intransitive verb 'follow':  mo-(Ø-)g-c'er                   mo-(Ø-Ø14 -)m-c'er           mi 1 5 -(0-0-)s-

134                           GEORGI AN GRAMMAR     Again there is an ambiguity in such forms as mo-g-q'v-eb-i-t, as
between (i) 'I'll follow you Pl', (ii) 'we'll follow you', and (iii) 'we'll follow you
Pl'.
     We have not yet discussed the bracketed 3rd person pluraliser from
Set B or what happens with transitive verbs when both direct and indirect
object would require a non-zero pronominal prefix within the verbal
complex, a couplingGEORGIANseems to prefer to avoid. As regards the
pluraliser, prescriptive rules require that Transitive Verbs simply never
mark the plurality of a 3rd person indirect object, which is why all forms
given above for 'write to' with 3rd person indirect object were glossed as
'to X/them'. I have come across only two examples where the plurality of a
3rd person indirect object is marked with this -t on a transitive verb; the
first is from lit'erat'uruli sakartvelo (29 March 1991, p.2):      xm-eb-i-c,            roml-eb-sa-c        asak'-i      ar

      'the voices too to which age does not give the means to express their
      wish...'where one would have expected (Ø-Ø-)a-jl-ev-s. The second is from
Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's lord of Rach'a. The verb is one of those which are
Transitive but lack a direct object, their second argument being the
indirect object, viz.      m+sm+en+el-eb-s       žriant'el-ma      da-(?Ø-Ø-)u-ar-a-t
      listener-Pl-DAT       shudder-ERG       PREV-(?3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)OV-run.

      'a shudder ran through the audience'    However, if the verb is a bipersonal intransitive, it is indeed possible to
mark the plurality of the 3rd person indirect object as long as the subject
of the verb is 3rd person singular, so that 'X will follow them' could be
either mi-h-q'v-eb-a or mi-h-q'v-eb-a-t. An attested example of this
feature with this very root, though with a different preverb, comes from
the text of Ivane Imnaishvili's 1971 Historical Chrestomathy of the
GEORGIANlanguage (vol 1. part 2) (p.344):

pluraliser, a consideration of these examples reveals that it cannot simply
be the prešence vs abšence of the plural indirect object in the clause, or
whether the plural indirect object precedes or follows its verb.
    More will be said when describing the formation of Series 111 for
Transitive and Medial verbs and of Indirect verbs in general about the use
with them of the two sets of pronominal affixes, but it is appropriate to
note at this point that, since with these forms the Dative nominal functions
as subject and the Nominative as direct object, the Set B affixes reprešent
the subject, whilst the Set A affixes correlate with the direct object. As
plural 3rd person human subjects impose their plurality on the verb, in
these instances the plurality of the Dative nominal will always be marked
on the verb by the suffixal -t if the Dative noun is human and if the direct
object is 3rd person (N.B. the plurality of the Nominative nominal is just
ignored as far as verbal agreement is concerned), e.g.     m+š+ob+el-s (Ø-)u-q'var-s                šv+il-i            /

      The parents love the children'   This suggests that during the course of its historyGEORGIANhas shifted
subject-status from the Nominative to the Dative nominal for these verb-
forms. There are two interesting illustrations in KEGl of what is
manifestly a bivalent Intransitive verb, namely 'be born to'. The first
comes from the great 19th century writer Ilia t'avč'avadze:      si+t'q'v+a-n-i      gul-ši        m-e-bad-eb-i-an

      'Words/Speeches are born to me in the heart (= are born in my heart)'where the old plural of the (non-human) subject imposes its plurality on the
verb 16 . This contrasts with the following from Ch'avch'avadze's equally
great contemporary, Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli:      šv+il-eb-i          (Ø-)e-bad-eb-a-t

being indicated by the Set A singular suffix -a-, whilst the Dative indirect
object has its plurality shewn by -t, just as if this were an Indirect verb,
which it palpably is not 17 . Thus, one cannot take the mere prešence of this
pluraliser with a 3rd person entity as an indicator that the 3rd person
entity in question is viewed as the subject of the verb-form.
    As already stated, this pluraliser for a 3rd person Dative nominal
should, according to prescriptivists, be found only when the Nominative
nominal is itself 3rd person. Once again, however, one does come across
instances where the pluraliser appears with 1st or 2nd person Nominative
nominals. Ak'ak'i Ts'ereteli's autobiography furnishes the examples:   da-v-(Ø-)u-brun-eb-i-v-a+r-t                          sopel-ši     da

    How, then, doesGEORGIANavoid having two non-zero Set B affixes
within a single verbal complex, as one would expect in the translation of
clauses like 'they give you to me'?GEORGIANavoids the difficulty by
paraphrasing one of the nominals as a 3rd person NP, which, of course,
takes a zero as its coreferential affix in the verb. The phrase in question
consists of the appropriate case of the noun tav-i 'head; self' preceded by
the possessive adjective of the paraphrased pronoun. This periphrasis then
substitutes for the direct object pronoun, e.g.   šen-i    m+s'+ob+l-eb-i  šen-s  tav-s                 (Ø-)m-a-jl-ev-en

      'our parents give us to you'    This periphrasis will even be used where the indirect object is 3rd
person, asGEORGIANseems to have a preference for interpreting a 1st or
2nd person pronominal prefix on a trivalent verb as the marker of indirect
rather than direct objecthood, e.g.      čem-i     m+š+ob+l-eb-i čem-s tav-s             ma+sc'avl+eb+el-s

      (3rd.PER-her-)lV-entrust-TS-they(PRES)
      'my parents are entrusting me/handing me over to the teacher'    However, where the context makes it clear which nominal is the direct
and which the indirect object, this rule may be ignored—for instance, if I
am the child, it is unlikely that my parents would be entrusting the teacher
to me, and so one might hear in place of the above čem-i m+š+ob+1-eb-i
ma+sc'avl+eb+el-s m-(Ø-)a-bar-eb-en, even if prescriptively this
sequence should be interpreted as though the verb were to be analysed
(Ø-)m-a-bar-eb-en with the šense 'they are entrusting X/them to me'.
KEGl provides an example of the verb 'introduce X to Y' with the
periphrastic rule observed, viz.

The other set of examples where an element -un- is attested is a range of
nominals depicting the production of types of sound. Examples: c'ruc'+
un-i 'squealing', c k m u t ' + u n - i / c ' k ' m u t ' + u n - i 'whimpering', c'lap'+un-

č ' r a č ' + u n - i 'creaking', xax+un-i 'rubbing', g r a č ' + u n - i 'gnashing (of

rax+un-i 'banging'. Sometimes the vowel before the nasal is -i-, and
sometimes - a - (e.g. t'it'+in-i 'prattling'; k'ak'+an-i 'cackling'). The
justification for assuming a morpheme-boundary, marked by the plus-sign,
is that some onomatopoeic words so formed exist in reduplications or other
variants which do not manifest this Vn-element (e.g. č x a p ' + u n - i
'splash(ing)' vs čxap'a = (čxup'-i 'sound of splashing', č ' q ' a p ' + u n - i

Notes
      Cf. c'ign-n-i da-(Ø-)c'er-n-a 'X wrote books', which in Modern GEORGI AN is da-
      (Ø-)c'er-a.
      This pronominal prefix should only coördinate with a Dative indirect object, and so
      should strictly not be prešent if the indirect object is reinterpreted as a direct object.
      For a discussion of this verb see Shanidze (1979.122).
      The relevant verbs (quoted in their OldGEORGIANforms) are: (ag-)a-gzn-eb 'you
      (will) stir up', a-gin-eb 'you (will) swear at', (ga-)a-gril-eb 'you (will) cool', a-
      i+jul-eb 'you (will) compel', (da-)a-k'vir+v-eb 'you (will) surprise', (mo-)a-(m)ši-
      eb 'you (will) make hungry', (da-)a-mjim-eb 'you (will) make heavy', a-mxil-eb 'you
      (will) bring X's bad actions to light', a-rcxu-en 'you (will) put to shame', (da-)a-
      rc'm+un-eb 'you (will) convince', (ag-)a-g-eb 'you (will) raise', (gan-)a-gwij-eb
      'you (will) awaken', (še-)a-urv-eb 'you (will) disturb', ( š ) a - š i n - e b 'you (will)
      frighten', (gan-)a-cin-eb 'you (will) make laugh', a-ct-un-eb 'you (will) lead into
      error', (gan-)a-cxr-ob 'you (will) give relief', (da-)a-)in-eb 'you (will) put to sleep',
      a-c'u-ev 'you (will) call upon X to do Y', a-č'en-eb 'you (will) thrust away', (če-)a-
      č'ir+v-eb 'you (will) upset', (gan-)a-xar-eb 'you (will) give joy to', (da-)a-jer-eb
      'you (will) convince'. For the verb 'curse' the 8-volume kartuli enis ganmart'ebiti
      leksik'oni 'Explanatory Dictionary of theGEORGIANlanguage' (KEGL) quotes an
      example with the reinterpreted second argument as direct object (viz. kmr-is
      sa+c'+ol-i š ( Ø - ) a - g i n - a husband-GEN bed-NOM         PREV-(it-)NV-curšshe(AOR)
      'she cursed [herj husband's bed'), but a letter printed in the organ of the Writers'
      union of 31 March 1989 (page 2) has the 'old' indirect object retained (viz. a+m kuč-
      is cq'oč-ma» ar še-(?Ø-Ø-)a-gin-a nodar-s                this street-GEN cock-ERG        not

      declined to curse Nodar'). Similarly for the verb 'compel' the now defunct journal of
      the Paris-basedGEORGIANčmigrč-community gušagi 'šentinel' had an example in its
      first issue (April, 1984, page 25) shewing Dative for the entity compelled and
      Nominative for the act they were compelled to perform alongside an Aorist verb-form
      (viz. ..sa+idan (Ø-Ø-)a-i+jul-es gad-mo-xt'-om-a xalx-s               whence (itSrd.PER-)

      '...whence they forced the people to burst through'), whereas one would have
      expected Nominative for the person compelled followed by a subordinate clause (in
      this case, sc. after a past-tense verb, with the Pluperfect of 'burst through').
      The Masdar is q'-ol-a = Mingrelian '-un-a/'w-en-a.
                                    VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                       5Ø75   This desiderative is not actually quoted as an existing form in the Academy
    Dictionary (KEGL), which is why I have prefaced it with a question-mark for this
    particular sense — the form may convey any of the meanings 'it is being written
    for/to/on me' without difficulty, though in these instances it is classified as a bivalent
    I ntransitive.
6   Always assuming that Georgian is correctly described as having such an aspectual
    system — for doubts see Rayfield (1994a).
7   For information on the pluraliser - q ' e found in some dialects see the relevant
    sections of Tuite (1991) or Tuite (1989).
8   The final i-vowel in these forms is a marker of the indicative mood.
9   Some might prefer suppletion to v-i-xoc-eb-i-t           when the underlying patient is
    plural.
10 The only screeves today retaining the voiceless back fricative, which was once the
    universal 2nd person subject indicator, are: the Present of the copula = x-a+r(-t)
    'you (you Pl..) are', and, for the verb of motion, which is here shewn with the preverb
    mo-, the Future Indicative = mo-x-val(-t) 'you (vou Pl.) will come', the Conditional =
    mo-x-vid-od-i(-t) 'you (you P1.) would (have) come', the Future Subjunctive ro(m)
    mo-x-vid-od-e(-t) 'if you (you(PU) were to come', the Aorist Indicative = m o - x -
    ved-i(-t) 'you (you Pl.) came', and the Aorist Subjunctive = ro(m) mo-x-vid-e(-t)
    'in order that you (you Pl.) may come'. ,
11. Changes to the root will be explained at the appropriate time.
12 The following examples come from lit'erat'uruli sakartvelo          'Literary Georgia' (3rd
    Feb 1989 page 11 and 1st June 1990 page 2 respectively): ra (Ø-)a-dard-eb- t

    riled at the peace between Georgia and the Abxazian people...'.
13 This h- used also to be found before - b , and it sometimes still occurs in this context.
    Volume 8 of KEGL, for instance, gives the entry-form é a - h - b a r - d - e b - a PREV-
    3rd.PER-be.entrusted-PASS-TS-X(FUT)          X will be entrused to Y'. The Dictionary of
    Morphemes and Modal Elements, published in 1988, also quotes such forms as da-h-
    bzu-i-s 'X buzzes over Y', whereas KEGL volume III, published in 1953, cites this
    latter verb without the h - .
14 These two zero-morphs represent respectively 2nd person subject and 3rd person
    direct object. I arbitrarily assume throughout this work that the affixal ordering is
    subject-direct object-indirect object.
15 The switch in preverb is dealt with below (4.3).
16 In Old Georgian plurals in -n- always imposed their plurality on the verb.
17 There is a homonymous Indirect Verb usually used in conjunction with a negative to
    mean 'have' (e.g. ara+per-i ar m-e-bad-eb-a            nothing-NOM not I-I OV-have-TS-
     it(FUT) 'I shall have nothing', which in the Present I ndicative would be m - a - b a d - i -
    a), but in the present instance we are dealing with the dynamic bipersonal passive of
    the root -bad- 'give birth'.
18 Masdars are usually construed with the relevant preverb.
19 Both variant-masdars (abstract-nouns) are employed by KEGL in the explanation
    offered of the entry-form i-rb-en-s 'X will run', namely: si-rb-il-it i-vl-i-s, r b -
    en-it c'a-va=c'a-mo-va 'X will move about running, X will go and come away
    running'.
20 The presence of a 1st or 2nd person direct object with a root that is construed with
    mi- does not of course occasion any such substitution (e.g. gvino t'k'b+il-ad mi-
    m-a-jin-eb-s 'wine will sweetly lull me to sleep').
5Ø8                              GEORGI AN GRAMMAR21    The natural order in English is of course here to have hither- followed by thither-
      orientation.
22    For the Dative in this quote from Vazha Pshavela cf. 5.1.1.5 (g).
23    The 3rd person subject-affix for this verb-form (sc. with any preverb) is actually zero
      as a result of the historical accident which saw the disappearance of material from
      the original end of the word, which was in Old Georgian da-val-s , where -s was the
      subject-suffix.
24    Note the plural verb-form though the subject is inanimate in this example from KEGL
25    Quoted by the Dictionary of Morphemes as da-h-mger-i-s .
26    The 1953 edition is not accessible to me.
27
      Forms such as (a-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an, (gada-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an, (ga-)(0-0-0-)a-
      t'an, (mo-)(0-0-0-)a-t'an (for which see the final paragraph of 4.4.4) are basically
      Locative Versional forms, for which see also 4.4.4. Note also the difference in the
      formation of the Perfect for the Subjective vs Locative Versional forms of this root
      (e.g. a-g-i-t'an-i-a 'you (have) apparently endured X/them' vs a-g-i-t'an-eb-i-a
      'you (have) apparently gone up and reached').
28    Cf. the Indo-European so-called Dative of Interest seen in this Latin example from
      Livy: militanti in Hispania pater eimoritur 'while he was serving [sc. Historic Present]
      in Spain, his father died', though, unlike Georgian, Latin verbs agree only with the
      subject argument.
29
      This is the Georgian translation (Danelia and Tsanava, 1991.47) of the Mingrelian
      osur-i giti-o-bs-әn-d- ә il ndem-c from one of the texts originally published by
      Q'ipshidze (1914).
30    KEGL does not quote the Subjective Versional form of this verb for the allomorph
      with an r root-finally.
31    N.B. (Ø-)g-i-sm-en-t 'I am listening to you (sc. to what you have to say)' with
      Objective Version, which is the standard opening gambit (a) when answering the
      phone or (b) for a waiter coming to take a customer's order.
32    The use of this verb with 'head' as direct object in the colloquial sense of 'cause
      shame to' necessitates the absence of versioniser (e.g. b i č - m a ojax-sa-c tav-i
      mo-(0-)s-č'r-a da čven-s sopel-sa-c             'the lad brought shame both to the family
      and to our village').
33    Note how this passive idea is conveyed by an active verb with non-referential 3rd
      person plural subject.
34    In verbs of this type the 'prescriptive' periphrasis that would change a 1st or 2nd
      person direct object into the 3rd person phrase 'my/our/your head' in the presence
      of a 3rd person indirect object tends to be ignored.
35
      There is also (mi-)(0-0-)i-p , at , iz'-eb .
36    Two Modern Georgian versions shew here the root - p ' q ' r - 'turn, direct' with
      Locative Version outranking the Subjective because of the (actual or implied)
      presence of an appropriate indirect object (viz. zeca-d ag-(0-?0-)a-p'q'r-o tval-
      n-i vs ca-s rni-(0-0-)a-p'q'r-o tval-eb-i).
37    Seen also in an ancient participle a+dg+il-i, now nominalised as 'place'.
38    Prescriptive grammar suggests that when the direct object is plural the root becomes
      -xoc-, as in (Ø-Ø-)xoc-av 'you kill them'.
39     In a number of compounds such as this the noun jvar-i does not syncopate (cf.
      me+jvar+e 'wedding-witness'), but when used in isolation it does syncopate (cf. the
      Genitive jvr-is ).
40    The element -n(i) here is the Mingrelian equivalent of the Georgian subordinator
      rom. If we transpose the Mingrelian system completely here into Georgian, an
       imperfective Conditional will be achieved simply by putting the auxiliary into its
      Conditional form (viz. i-kn-eb-od-a), whilst an imperfective Future Subjunctive will
      result if the auxiliary is placed in its Future Subjunctive form (viz. i-kn-eb-od-e-s).
                                  VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                    5Ø941
     Cf. da-v-(0-)xoc-av 'I shall kill them'.
42   The preverb may be mo- under appropriate conditions.
43   Clearly the morphemic analysis of this verb-form is problematic: the Nominative case -
     marking of 'enemy' would suggest that the second zero-morph of the verb should
     carry the question-mark, but the fact that this Nominative nominal 'controls' the
     versioniser suggests that the first zero-morph is the one without an external noun.
44
     Under appropriate circumstances the preverb may change to mo-.
45
     Clearly the underlying form here is /ga-0-q'v-a/. Since the 3rd person singular of
     the copula in the Aorist has a similar underlying root-suffixal sequence, namely / i -
     q'v-a/, which in this book I write i-q'+o, for consistency I should perhaps also write
     ga-(0-)q'+o here.
46   At least this is the prescriptive rule, even if the occasional exception is found in
     texts.
47   Note this almost literal equivalent to the English method of giving dates, whereas the
     normal way today would be to say rva ianvar-s 8 January-DAT 'on the 8th
     January'.
48   In such combinations one of these labio-dentals may fail to be pronounced.
49
     Note that the radical labio-dental drops under the influence of this immediately
     following bilabial.
50   As explained in 5.2.2.1.7.4.3, a past temporal clause meaning 'before' is normally
     constructed with the Conditional (or Aorist). Is the presence here of the Pluperfect in
     the subordinate clause the result of the influence of the preceding Pluperfect or just
     a variant in the same way as English here allows both 'before you had VERBed' and
     'before you VERBed'?
51   Interestingly in the Mingrelian language, spoken in part of West Georgia, the
     Pluperfect of active voiced Transitive Verbs stands in the same relation to the
     Perfect as the Imperfect Indicative does to the Present Indicative, with the Objective
     Version generalised for marking the subject (e.g. do-m-(i-)č'ar(-u) = Georgian da-
     m-i-c'er-i-a 'I have written X/them' vs do-m-(i-)č'ar-u-d(-u)         = Georgian da-m-
     e-c'er-a 'I had written X/them').
52   Mingrelian has formalised this semantic distinction, at least as far as Series I
     screeves are concerned: i-č'ar-u 'X is being written' vs i-č'ar-e 'X can be written';
     m-a-č'ar-u 'X is being written for/on me' vs m-a-č'ar-e 'I can write X/them'.
53
     Interestingly Mingrelian uses the active voice (Transitive pattern) for both such
     verbs, viz. (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rz-en-k vs (Ø-Ø-)i-rz-en-k
54   This particular paradigm is a common Present Indicative for a number of verbs
     distinguished outside the Present Sub-Series by different preverbs. Perhaps the
     forms presented here are most often used in the sense of 'I remain/stay', which
     implies the use of the preverb da-.
55   Examples in KEGL suggest that, if the indirect object is inanimate, it may be
     expressed by means of the Objective Version.
56   This is the root-form of the Perfect as quoted by KEGL. However, in V. Topuria and
     Iv. Gigineishvili's 'Orthographic Dictionary' of 1968 the root-form ga-g-i-jg-i-a is
     given.
57   Do not confuse this with (ga-)i-njr-ev-i 'you (will) move', the Intransitive form of
     (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-njr-ev = (ga-XØ-Ø-)jr-av 'you (will) set X/them in motion'.
58   The Imperfect equivalent of sa-k'itx-i i-s-m-i-s 'a question is being posed' is sa-
     k'itx-i i-s-m-od-a.
59   The meaning 'come forth to meet' would result from a change of preverb to mo-.
60    KEGL wrongly gives this form as the impossible mo-i-xvn-a.
61   Note the devoicing of the back fricative in the first two persons.
62    For this one verb Tschenkéli (1958.I.271) reports a variant in - e .
510                                  GEORGI AN GRAMMAR
63    One meets the occasional example (and not infrequently in the works of Vazha
      Pshavela) where, in place of the regular expansion in -od- plus Imperfect Indicative
      or Prešent Subjunctive endings, the Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive of bipersonal
      Intransitives are formed after the pattern of monopersonal Intransitives, i.e. by the
      addition of the Aorist Indicative or Aorist Subjunctive respectively of the copula.
      For example, take the Indirect Verb (and Indirect Verbs are formally identical to
      bipersonal Intransitives in Series III) in romel-sa-c še+u+jl+eb+el-i-a e+s
      si+t'q'v-eb-i da-(Ø-)vic'q'-eb-i-q'+o 'who it is impossible to have forgotten these
      words' (instead of da-(Ø-)vic'q'-eb-od-a ); instead of ar m-a-xs+ov-s vin+me
      gverd-ze mo-m-jd-om-od-e-s                         'I don't recall anyone sitting down beside me' one
      may hear the III rd Subjunctive formed as m o - m - j d - o m - i - q ' - o - s . An example is
      even available of a monopersonal Perfect replacing the expected bipersonal form: it
      is from the now defunct Paris-basedGEORGIANjournal 'šentinel' (No. 29, 1992, p.6Ø):
      kart+ul-i p'resa a+m gir+s+še+sa+nišn+av mo+vl+en+a-s ar g a - m o -
      x m a + u r - e b - u l - a 'theGEORGIANpress has not responded to this significant
      phenomenon' (in place of the 'correct' ga-mo-(Ø-)xma+ur-eb-i-a ).
64    KEGl quotes an alternative ending, namely -ev-i(-t) , when the subject is 1st or 2nd
      person.
65    Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would respectively be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-v-
      i-v-a+r-t, da-(Ø-Ø-)xoc-v-i-x-a+r-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-v-i-an
66    Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-od-i-t, da-(Ø-
      Ø-)xoc-od-i-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-od-nen
67
      This phonetic form may also be interpreted as da-(Ø-Ø-)bad-eb-od-e-t                               'may
      you(Pl.) be born to X/them'.
68    This phonetic form may also mean 'may I/we be born to you(Pl.)' or 'may we be born
      to you'.
69    This phonetic form may also be interpreted as da-(Ø-Ø-)mal-od-e-t                         'may you(Pl.)
      hide from X/them'.
70    This form may also mean 'may I /we stick to you(Pl.)' or 'may we stick to you'.
71    Prescriptively, this and the next two forms would be: da-v-(Ø-)xoc-od-e-t,                      da-(Ø-
      Ø-)xoc-od-e-t, da-(Ø-)xoc-od-nen.
72    This is short for magalit-ad 'for example', and I simply give here a possible fIIIer
      just to offer a flavour of the construction.
73    Though this is 'regular' insofar as the form is bipersonal, since the Masdar is g a -
      xir-v-a , one would have expected this bipersonal form to be ga-g-xir-v-i-a,
      seemingly unattested according to both KEGl and Tschenkčli's dictionary.
74    N.B. Tschenkčli offers a choice for the participial base of such forms by prešenting a
      bracketed element, viz. ga-(Ø-)xir-(eb-)ul-x-a+r .
75
      E.g. ar-c c'in c'a-(?Ø-)e-čr-eb-a, ar-c uk'an ča-mo-dg-eb-a                             'X will neither
      push himself forward nor step back'.
76    As in this example: i+ma-s ver v-(Ø-)i-t'q'v-i, rom šuxart-i srul+i+ad ga-
      rk'v-e-ul-i-q'-o-s                  xan-is (resp.           haes) p'repiks-eb-ad         xmar+eb-is
      sa+k'itx-Si 'I shan't be able to say that Schuchardt gained a complete understanding
      of the question of the use as prefixes of xan (or hae)'.
77    As in: čv+e+ul+eba-d m-a-kv-s mo+u+mzad+eb+1-ad ar-sad c'a-v-(?Ø-)e-
      čxir-o 'I have the practice of not getting involved anywhere unprepared'.
78    An interesting example of the use of such a structurally unmotivated -eb to create a
      formal distinction in Series III not found elsewhere in the paradigms is seen in the
      case of š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v e c ' - e b - i - x - a + r   'you apparently went in exile to place X and
      took refuge there', which has Prešent-Future (s'e-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xvec , -eb-i                     and Aorist
      ( š ) ( Ø - Ø - ) e - x v e c ' - e . These Series I and II forms are also used in the šense of
      'you (will) beseech X/them', which verb then has the Perfect š ( Ø - Ø - ) x v e c ' + n - i - x -
      a+r; this is based on the Masdar ( š ) x v e c ' + n - a 'beseeching; taking refuge', which
      would be expected to underlie Series III for the latter of its šenses too. In the case
                                      VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                             511     of (áe-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xizn-eb-i 'you (will) take refuge in X' (Masdar še-xizvn-a) KEGL
     gives the Perfect as še-(Ø-Ø-)xizvn-i-x-a+r , and yet in the illustrations appended
     to the relevant entry we find an example of the Pluperfect from Tedo Razik'ashvili
     shewing the unmotivated -eb again, viz. bosl-eb-sa da sa+bj+1-eb-s še-(Ø-)
     x i z n - e b - o d - n e n 'they had taken refuge in the animal- and grain-barns'.
79   There can be no doubt about this: KEGL gives as one synonym for (da-)(Ø-)i-c'ok-
     eb-a the (transitive) verb-phrase muxl-s (mo-)(Ø-)i-q'r-i-s , where muxl-i = 'knee'
     and the verb means 'bend'. Thus, the example arčil-i giorg-is login-tan da-
     čok-il-i-q'+o 'Archil had knelt down at the bed of Giorgi' could be paraphrased as
     arčil-s...muxl-i mo-(Ø-)e-q'ar-a. In voluntary buckling of the knees is expressed
     by the bipersonal intransitive verb seen in: vin-me-s muxl-i (mo-)(Ø-)e-č'r-eb-
     a/Amo-)(Ø-)e-k'vet-eb-a, literally 'the knee is/will be cut//sliced for someone'.
80   For my review see Hewitt (1983a).
81   There are two types of exception: (i) Medials which have no Future Sub-Series but
     which would have employed this combination of affixes to form the non-existent
     screeves, had they existed, and (ii) a small number of irregular Medials which use
     only the prefix i- to form the Future Sub-Series.
82   Taking an example like the following from Literary Georgia (18 Nov 1988, p. 15): c ' a -
     val da šv+il-eb-sa-c da-v-(Ø-)xoc-av, tav-s ar v-(Ø-)i-cocxl-eb                          'I shall go
     and kill (my) children; I shall not allow myself to live', we assume tav-s v-(Ø-)i-
     cocxl-eb 'I shall allow myself to live' became v-(Ø-)i-cocxl-eb 'I shall be/remain
     alive'.
83   There are a number of examples where a Series 111 screeve of some Medial is
     presented (sc. other than in actual citations from literature) at different places in the
     8-volume KEGL, now with the nasal, now without it.
84   This is the ceremony when, during the lying-in-state at home in the days before the
     funeral, visitors come to pay their respects by ritualistic weeping over the corpse.
85   Some Medials in -av produce their Perfects like normal Transitive Verbs in -av (e.g.
     (Ø-)bobg-av = (Ø-)bordg-av = (Ø-)xox-av 'you crawl' have Perfects g - i - b o b g -
     a v - s = g-i-bordg-av-s = g-i-xox-av-s, and yet (Ø-)čoč-av 'you crawl' has the
     Perfect g-i-čoč-(?n-)-a!
86   Cf. the synonyms based on cognate forms: varaud-ad a+r-i-s 'it is as a supposition'
     or s a - v a r a u d - o - a 'it is a matter for supposition'.
87   Cf. the synonym based on a cognate form: sa-grjn-ob-i-a 'it is perceptible'.
88   Cf. the synonyms based on cognate forms: na-gul+is+xm-ev-i-a 'it is meant' or s a -
     gul+is+xm-eb-el-i-a 'it is to be meant'.
89   Wherever this o-vowel is absent in the paradigm, the labio-dental is restored, as in
     the Future (?Ø-)i-gor-av-eb-s 'X will roll around'.
90   This sort of verb, discussed under 2.5 with reference to sound-symbolism, is a typical
     member of the Medial class.
91   There is also (?Ø-)a-c'vim-eb-s 'X brings (will bring) rain' (e.g. k a r - i guria-ši
     xšir-ad (?Ø-)a-c'vim-eb-s 'the wind often brings rain to Guria').
92   With Objective Version we have ši+mš+il-it gul-i m-i-c'ux-s 'my heart is heavy
     through hunger', or, from the inceptive, kal-s gul-i (Ø-)u-c'ux-d-eb-od-a                        'the
     woman's heart was turning sad'.
93   For both m o - c u r - a v - s and m i - c u r - a v - s there is a full set of paradigms, so that
     the meanings respectively are 'X swims (will swim) over here' and 'X swims (will swim)
     over there' (=> Aorist m o - / m i - c u r - a => Perfect mo-/mi-(Ø-)u-cur-av-s ).
94   Note a cognate synonym formed as a bipersonal (but monovalent) Intransitive Verb,
     viz. da-(?Ø-)e-xet'-eb-a.
95   Only the form with indirect object is quoted by KEGL when the preverb is da-.
96   Note the shift of Thematic Suffix from -ob without indirect object to -eb here. The
     verb may be used as in the expression av+ad+m+q'+op-is t'uč-eb-s gim+il-i da-
512                                      GEORGI AN GRAMMAR      s-tamaS-eb-d-a = ga-mo-h-k'rt-od-a 'a smile was playing around the lips of the
      sick person'.
97 Note that the preverb here is not in the Prešent Sub-Series.
98 Such formations are not limited to Medials. Consider: c ' a - ( Ø - Ø - ) i - č ' 'you will
      have a bite of something to eat'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-loc-av 'you will say a little prayer';
      c'a-i-t'rus-eb-a 'X will get a bit scorched'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-)in-eb 'vou will snatch a
      bit of sleep'; c'a-i-nam-eb-a 'X will get a bit wet with dew'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-xems-
      eb = š ( Ø - ) n a q ' r - d - e b - i 'you will snatch a bite of food'.
99 Cf. the unmarked Intransitive Verb (da-)prtx-eb-i 'you (will) take fright' <= (da-)(Ø-
      Ø-)a-prtx-ob 'you (will) alarm X/them' or, with ga- as an alternative preverb, 'you
      (will) frighten and put to flight'. With this compare (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)a-prtx+il-eb 'you
      (will) warn X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)u-prtx+il-d-eb-i 'you (will) be wary of X/them'
      or 'you (will) treat X/them with care'.
100 E.g. delegat'-eb-i si+am+ovn+eb-it (Ø-)p'asux-ob-en q'ovel+gvar t'q'u+il-
      sa da mo+čven+eb+it še+k'itx+v-eb-s 'the delegates provide answers with
      pleasure to every kind of lie and specious question'.
101 Also the indirect object may be the possessor of the subject (e.g. luarsab-s saxe
      mudam (Ø-)u-cin-od-a 'luarsab's face was always laughing').
102 Cf. bed-i g-i-gim-i-s 'fate smiles on you' (vs bed-i (?Ø-)g-i-muxtl-eb-s 'fate lets
      (will let) you down').
103 Cf. (mo-/mi-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-c , od-eb                 -tan 'you (will) issue a call/summons to X/them
       to Y', not to be confused with (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'od-eb                  'you (will) hand X/them
       to Y/them', produced by back-formation from the Aorist mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'od-e
       which originally had the (stIII extant) Prešent-Future (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'vd-i
       with the Intransitive (Ø-)s-c'vd-eb-l 'you reach out and attain/touch X/them'; any
      appropriate preverb is used (as indeed for the corresponding Transitive) to produce
       the perfective screeves (e.g. Future m o - / m i - / a - 7 g a - / ( 5 a - ( Ø - ) s - c , v d - e b - i =>
       Aorist mo-/mi-/a-/ga-/ča-(Ø-)s-c'vd-i                  => Perfect m o - / m i - / a - / g a - / š a - ( Ø - ) s -
       c'vd-om-i-x-a+r).
1Ø4 Note that there is no preverbless Prešent to this Future, for (Ø-Ø)a-)ax-eb is the
       (pseudo-)Causative 'you (will) make X/them shout' (Perfect g-i-)ax-eb-i-a ).
1° 5 For mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)ax-eb cf. Transitive (mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xl-i 'you (will)
      bring X/them crashing against Y/them; you (will) shoot X/them at Y/them; you (will)
      hurl verbal X at Y/them'.
1Ø6 NO form with mo- is quoted.
1Ø7 Note the prešence of the Thematic Suffix -eb, which means that this is not simply
       the basic Medial plus preverb.
1Ø8 This example using either of the transitive synonyms would inGEORGIANbe: (i)
       Prešent-Future pot-a-mde or dge-s (mo-)v-(Ø-Ø-)a-nd+om-eb                                         = (še-)v-
       (Ø-Ø-)a-l-ev        si+a+r+ul-s, (ii) Aorist pot-a-mde or-i dge mo-v-(Ø-Ø-)a-
       nd+om-e = še-v-(Ø-Ø-)a-l-i-e si+a+r+ul-s , (iii) Perfect pot-a-mde or-i dge
       mo-m-i-nd+om-eb-1-a = še-m-i-1-ev-i-a si+a+r+ul-is-tvis
 109 Presumably a second Dative (such as game-s 'night' or p'eriod-s 'period') is
       understood.
 110. E.g. č'+a k+on-eb-a-ze h-k'id-i-a 'eating hangs on having' = 'how one eats
       depends on what one has'.
 111 For which c'ign-s da-v-(Ø-)a-t'ar-eb serves as a Transitive alternative in either
       the prešent or the future.
 112
     One of the two labio-dentals in such collocations may be omitted.
 113 For which malmun-s da-v-(Ø-)a-t'ar-eb serves as a Transitive alternative in
       either the prešent or the future.
 114 The archaic mo-m-e-sm-i-s (etc..) is also sometimes stIII found.
 115 For the preverbal form KEGl quotes the Perfect as mo-m-sm-i-a.
                                         VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                                513
116 The only example given by KEGl has the recipient of the information governed by
    the postposition - t a n . However, the preradical - a - is surely the locative Version in
    origin, and if we note that with preverb š                    this same meaning is possible and that
    the recipient may stand in the Dative as indirect object (e.g. me+p+e vaxt'ang ...
    q'een-s š ( Ø - Ø - ) a - s m - i n - e s   'they informed on King Vaxt'ang to the khan'), it is
    likely that the Dative too will be possible with preverb da-.
117 In the šense of 'accept a proposal/plea', in which case it is synonymous with (še-)(Ø-
    Ø-)i-c'q'nar-eb.
118 Sometimes found without preverb even in the normally perfective screeves.
119
    The antonym is (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c'un-eb.
120 Not to be confused with (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c'q'-eb 'you (will) begin X/them'.
121 N.B. such Prešent Sub-Series only formations as c ' a - ( ? Ø - ) i - b o r š č - e b - s 'it
    resembles borshch', c ' a - ( ? Ø - ) i - m e + c n + i e r - e b - s 'X makes himself out to be a
    scholar/scientist'.
122 Cf. from sa+c'q'+al-i 'wretched' we get the similarly formed tav-s (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-
    sa+c'q'+l-eb 'you (will) make yourself out to be wretched', and from m-k'vd-ar-i
    'dead' we have tav-s (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-m+k'vd+ar-un-eb 'you                             (will) pretend to be
    dead'.
123 Also for this šense in the Prešent Sub-Series only we have g-i-mjim-s (from mjime
    'heavy'), as in mo+x+u+c-s suntk+v+a (Ø-)u-mjim-d-a = (Ø-)u-č'ir-d-a 'the old
    man found breathing difficult'.
124 Cf. the figurative expression k'ač'k'ač'-s ga-(?Ø-Ø-)a-civ-a da ga-(?Ø-Ø-)a-
    cx+el-a äiä-isa-gan 'the magpie got a cold and hot fever from fear'. 'Fever' =
    c i + e b - c x + e l + e b a , where the root -ci(v)- indicates 'cold'. We have a similar type
    of construction for the expression ' X D A T comes out in a rash', as seen in the
    following example, where only the agent of the verb remains unstated: bavšv-s mtel
    t'an-ze m u c ' u k ' - e b - i ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)a-q'ar-?a                 'the child came out in spots all

    Holisky (1981.129) quotes (?Ø-)e-civ-eb-a, but this is not given by                      KEGl
126 As an ailment 'cold' is surdo (e.g. surdo m-a-kv-s 'I have a cold') vs grip'-i 'flu'.
127 The older form of the root was - t ' p - and it is assumed to be a borrowing from the
    Indo-European root that gives us 'tepid'. TheGEORGIANcapital, Tbilisi, literally means
    '(the place) of something warm', usually taken to refer to the hot natural springs of
    the area. The older form of the root gave rise, through Persian, to the former
    English designation of Tiflis.
128 On the same principle one has gril-a 'it is cool' => Future si+gril+e i-kn-eb-a or
    (?Ø-)e-gril-eb-a, which latter may also function with a true indirect object as a
    synonym for (Ø-)u-gril-d-eb-a 'X becomes cool for Y' => Imperfect gril-od-a 'it
    was cool' (cf. s i - g r i l - e 'coolness', g r i l - i 'cool'), without being able to form an
    Indirect Verb from it, as well as bnel-a 'it is dark' (cf. s i - b n e l - e 'darkness', b n e l - i
    'dark') => Future (?Ø-)e-bnel-eb-a or si+bnel+e i-kn-eb-a.
129
    Holisky (1981.129) but not KEGl quotes (?Ø-)e-tb+il-eb-a for the Future.
130 Or should we analyse g-e-t'k'-in-eb-a?
131 In the Future a - g - t V i v - a is also possible.
132 -tvin is an older form of -tvis 'for'.
133 Between vowels the -v- is optional.
134 It would appear that the origin of the sequence -ši(v)- lies in the Aorist of this
    earlier form (viz. mo-(Ø-Ø-)a-m+š-i-e 'you made X/them hungry').
135 Sometimes the preradical - e - is (incorrectly) altered to -i-.
136 Cf. (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)e-vač'r-eb-i 'you haggle with X/them over the price of Y' => Aorist
     (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)e-vač'r-e => Perfect                  še-rø-?Ø-Ø-)vač'r-eb-i-x-a+r           (e.g. ert u r e m - s
     (?Ø-)g-e-vač'r-eb-i 'I am bargaining with you over the price of one wagon').

137 In the šense of 'stretch out to get hold of X/them' this verb-form is bipersonal in
     Series III with the Perfect da-(Ø-)šur-eb-i-a i+s ma-s             'X has stretched out to
     grab Y'.
138 KEGl quotes mo-(Ø-Ø-)u-čkar-eb-s pex-s                  as equivalent to a-(Ø-Ø-)u-škar-
     eb-s pex-s, but in the one example quoted (from Vazha Pshavela) we see the noun
     for 'foot' standing in the Nominative (not the Dative) with an Aorist verb-form (viz.
     mo-(Ø-?Ø-)u-čkar-es        m+dev+r-eb-ma-c pex-i             'the pursuers too increased
     their pace'). Cf. nabij-s/si+a+r+ul-s mo-v-(?Ø-Ø-)u-mat'-o-t 'let's increase             our
     pace/walking', and ma+t'ar+eb+el-ma             (?Ø-Ø-)u-mat'-a/(?Ø-Ø-)u-k'l-o    svl+a-s
     'the train increased/decreased its speed (lit. movement)'.
139
     Or should it be g-c'q'+in-s?
140 As a non-Indirect Verb we can have (Ø-)s-jer-x-a+r as a synonym for (Ø-)s-jer-
     d-eb-i 'you are satisfied with X D A T ' .
141 There is a gap here in the Indirect paradigm which is fIIIed by the Medial formation
     from (Ø-Ø-li-c'am-eb 'you will judge X/them credible' => Perfect g-i-c'am-eb-i-a.
142
     E.g. m+mart+v+el+ob-ts si+sul+el-it xalx-i sa+č'm+l-is na+k'1+eb+oba-s
     gan-(Ø-)i-cd-i-s 'through the folly of the government the people are suffering a
     shortage of food'.
143 For which g-e-mjim-eb-a/g-e-mjim-a                 'you deem/deemed X/them heavy' is a
     virtual synonym vs g-e-mčat'-eb-a/g-e-mčat'-a 'you deem/deemed X/them light'.
144 ALL Transitive Verbs (other than those in -av and -am) end in this same sequence in
     the Perfect when their direct object is 3rd person. In OldGEORGIANboth Statives and
     all Transitive Verbs (other than those in -av and -am) in the Perfect ended in the
     sequence -ie-s . This parallelism leads to the hypothesis that in origin today's Perfect
     of Transitive Verbs was a Stative-Resultative formation that was fundamentally
     intransitive with a Nominative subject and Dative indirect object of the interested
     party (indicated by means of the Objective Version). A reinterpretation took place of
     the roles of these two arguments (leading to the Dative becoming the subject and the
     Nominative becoming the direct object) as the hypothesised Resultative was
     assimilated as the modern-day Perfect screeve within the new three-Series verbal
     system as it affected Transitive (and Medial) Verbs.
145 Vogt (1971.158) gives an example in Objective Version with two Datives (viz. ra-c me
     (?Ø-)m-i-k'id-i-a aklem-eb-s, met'-i ar m-i-nd-a               'I want no more than what I
     have suspended on the camels').
146 Out of context such Future Sub-Series and Series II screeves are ambiguous
     between the Stative šense being discussed here and the Dynamic šense, which would
     be 'X is being hung up for Y' for (Ø-)e-k'id-eb-a, whose Future would now be da-
     (Ø-)e-k'id-eb-a vs the Aorist da-(Ø-)e-k'id-a vs the Perfect da-h-k'id-eb-i-a
147 Vogt (1971.157) not only quotes the Objective Versional pul-i (Ø-)u-bar-i-a bank'-
     ši 'X has money deposited at the bank' but also (p. 166) an MP bar-eb-ul-a, neither
     of which appears in KEGl.
148 Vogt has the Objective Versional maril-i (Ø-)u-bn-ev-i-a               'X has salt scattered
     about', which is abšent from KEGl.
149 This is the form given by KEGl, but Shanidze offers h-bj-in-eb-i-a .
150 Also used in the same šense is h - g o n - e b - s ' X N O M thinks Y' (e.g. v-(Ø-)gon-eb
      tav-s p'irvel k'ac-ad 'I suppose myself to be top man').
151 Or is it d+ev-s/j+ev-s?
152 Vogt offers the variant (Ø-)u-dv-i-a .
153 E.g. xalx-ši v-(Ø-)u-r-ev-i-v-a+r           'I am involved with the people' => Perfect v-r-
      e-ul-v-a+r.
154 E.g. for the Perfect bze-s p'ur-is marcval-i (Ø-)r-ev-i-a               'the chaff apparently
     had wheat-grain mixed up in it'.

    Sometimes the Prešent of this verb in particular takes an extra element -n word-
    finally. The full form of the root is -rkv- (cf. tv+it+ma+rkv+i+a 'self-styled').
156 Vogt gives an example with two Dative: imed-i gul-sa (?Ø-)m-p-en-i-a                   'hope is
    cast over my heart'.
157 Is the sequence -q'en- an amalgamation of the copular root - q ' - plus an old
    Causative - e n - ? If someone is already on their feet and you make them stand
    somewhere, this verb is used; if you help someone to their feet, then the preverb a-
    is necessary; for 'cocking a gun' the preverb is š , just as it is for the meaning 'halt'.
158 This form with initial s- is normally used in the šense given. However KEGl gives
    c'er-i-a as the monovalent form, suggesting that when initial s- is prešent the
    meaning is 'be written for X', though the only example quoted for this is the
    colloquialism a+ka+ur+oba-s jvar-i s-c'er-i-a/(ø-)e-c'er-o-sl 'Touch wood!'.
159 Cf. (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)a-c'q'-ob 'you (will) arrange (e.g. meeting)', (a-XØ-Ø-)a-c'q'-ob
    'you (will) arrange things on or in somewhere', (ča-XØ-Ø-la-c'q'-ob 'you (will)
    arrange things down inside something/get things sorted out by sly means (e.g.
    bribery)'; cf. ra ga-v-(Ø-)a-c'q'-o? 'what can I be expected to do about it?', ra
    ga-(Ø-)e-c'q'-ob-a? 'what is there for it/what's to be done?', xval tu ar g-a-
    c'q'-ob-s, zeg š v - ( Ø - ) x v d - e - t (ert+man+et-s) 'if tomorrow is no          good for
    you, let's meet (each other) the day after tomorrow'.
160 Note the extra element -eb-. Cf. (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xil-(v-)eb 'you (will) shew X/them to
    Y/them', though tval-s (Ø-Ø-)a-xil-eb may be used like tval-s (Ø-Ø-)a-xel 'you
    open your eyes'; note also from xil-i 'fruit' the verb (Ø-Ø-Ø-)xil-eb 'you (will) give
    X/them the first taste of some fruit Y' (e.g. st'umr-eb-s q'urjen-i v-(Ø-Ø-)a-xil-
    o-t 'let's give the guests their first taste of grapes'.
161 E.g. nene-m š ( Ø - Ø - ) a - v e d r - a gvt+a+eba-s tav+is-i p'ir+m+š+o                  'Nene
    besought the godhead for protection for her first-born'. A synonym for (še-)(Ø-)e-
     vedr-eb-a is ( i e - X Ø - ) e - x v e c ' - e b - a , from which we have the monopersonal
    derivative in the Prešent Sub-Series only i-xvec'-eb-a 'X is urging, pleading' and
     the parallel Causative (še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvec'-eb 'you (will) ask seek protection for
    X/them DO from Y/them IO'. However, preverbless (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvec'-eb                      may be
     used in Imeretian like either (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvec'+n-in-eb              or the strange (Ø-Ø-Ø-)i-
     xvec'+i-eb in the meaning 'you (will) get X/them to beseech Y/them (to do Z)//to ask
     for Y/them (from Z/them)'. Not to be confused with (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-xvec'-in-eb
     'you (will) get X/them to polish/refine Y/them' <= Prešent-Future (da-XØ-Ø-)xvec'.
162 In OldGEORGIAN- e v - also functioned as a possible Causative exponent, and a few
     verbs are stIII used with this suffix.
163 Not to be confused with (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-}a-)l-eb-in-eb                  'you empower X/them to
     survive//enable X/them to put up with Y/them' from (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-)jl-eb 'you (will)
     survive/stay' or (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)l-eb 'you (will) put up with X/them' (e.g.
     žang+bad-i          (?Ø-Ø-)a-)l-eb-in-eb-s              m+pr+in+av-s aero+st'at'-it did
     si+magl+e-ze a+pr+en-isa-s 'oxygen allows a pilot to survive when flying at
     great height by balloon').
164 This Causative could also correspond to (ča-XØ-Ø-Ø-)a-cv-am                      'you (will) put
     X/them on Y/them' (Perfect ča-g-i-c-m-ev-i-a -tvis), in which                case the original
     indirect object would appear as postpositional object of - t v i s , e.g. deda mama-s
     p'alt'o-s (ša-)(Ø-Ø-)a-c-m-ev+in-eb-s bavSv-is-tvis                   , which in Series III
     produces a second postpositional phrase with - t v i s , viz. deda-s mam-is-tvis
     p'alt'o ča-(Ø-)u-c-m-ev+in-eb-i-a bavSv-is-tvis
165
     The Conditional is (Ø-Ø-)i-sc'avl-i-d-i.
166
     The Imperfect/Conditional is (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-sc'avl-i-d-i.
167 Cf. the phrase da+xmar+eb+a-s (ga-XØ-Ø-Ø-)u-c'-ev                          'you (will) render

    suffixal vowels - e - and -a- respectively.
172 Though this is one of the Root Verbs which does alter the root in the Intransitive
    (e.g. (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)cvet 'you wear out X/them' vs (ga-)cvd-eb-a 'X wears out'), this
    Masdar may do service for both Transitive and Intransitive forms, even though a

      mo-/mi-xmar-eb-a 'help(ing)' from (da-/mo-/mi-)(Ø-Ø-)e-xmar-eb-i.
217   This is 'sleeping' vs m-)in-ar-a 'with a penchant for sleeping'.

      (š)(Ø-Ø-)i-q'var-eb 'you (will) conceive a love for X/them'.
220   From the OldGEORGIANform, a+r-s, comes the derived noun a+r+s-i meaning either
      'living creature' (cf. the synonyms a+r+s+eba or sul+dg+m+ul-i) or 'esšence' (cf.
      ra+oba). The OldGEORGIANform also provides the basis for the verbs (da-)(Ø-
      Ø-)a-a+r+s-eb 'you (will) found X/them', (Ø-)a+r+s+eb-ob ( (Ø-)i-a+r+s+eb-eb)
      'you (will) exist' => a+r+s+eb-ob-a 'existence'.
221   Note the expected Mingrelian correlate in the corresponding Prešent Indicative: v-
      o+r-e-k, (Ø-)(o+)r-e-k, (o+)r-e(-n), v-o+r-e-t, (Ø-)(o+)r-e-t, (o+)r-e-n-
      a(n). Mingrelian has a full Prešent Sub-Series for its copula, but the forms that are
      cognate with GEORGI AN's u n d Series paradigms have the meaning 'become' in
      Mingrelian.
222   Note this construction with net'av plus Aorist Indicative with unexpressed 3rd
      person subject for a wish that is esšentially unrealisable.
223    Changing the preverb alters the meaning accordingly (e.g. a-svl-a 'going up', š e -
      mo-svl-a 'coming in').
224   In effect the 3rd person subject-affix here in the modern form is a zero-suffix.
225    When coupled with the preverb c'a-mo- , as in c'a-mo-di(-t) 'Come on along!', the
      preverb alone is often used in Imperative function (viz. c'a-mo!).
226   Cf. m+q'+op+ad-i 'Future Indicative'.
227   For the preverbless form (GEN = sa-val-isa ) cf. mirian-s jnel-sa-val t'q'e-ši
      gza da-(Ø-)e-bn-a 'Mirian lost his way in a difficult-to-negotiate forest'. It may be
      substantivised as in a+k-e+dan ert-i saat-is sa-val-i-a 'from here it is a one
      hour journey'.
228   Cf. še-mo-sa-val-i (GEN = š e - m o - s a - v l - i s a ) 'income, revenue'. As Future
      Participles 'for entry' we have both ša-sa-svl-el-i and š s a - v a l - i (GEN = š s a -
       vl-isa), though the former is used as the noun 'entrance, way in' — cf. ga-sa-val-i
       (GEN = ga-sa-vl-isa 'exit'), the latter as the noun 'introduction (e.g. to a book)'. N.B.
       the nominal use of g a d a - s a - s v l - e l - i 'crossing-point', as in                  mic'+is+kve+š+a
       gada-sa-svl-el-i 'underground-crossing, underpass'; the nominal use of ga-mo-sa-
       val-i with syncopating -a- is 'escape, way out (of problem)'; the nominal use of tav-
       gada-sa-val-i with syncopating -a- is 'series of adventures in life, biography'.
229    The morpheme-division here assumes that -ul- is the participial formant, whereas
       one could also analyse the word as mo-sul-i with - s u l - a variant of the root - s v l -
       seen in the Masdar.
230    Note the ordering of the agreement-affixes here: the Objective Versional complex
       precedes the intransitive subject marker!
231    Even though their III rd Series are formally identical, do not confuse this verb with
       Future ga-(Ø-)i-vl-eb-s, Aorist ga-(Ø-)i-vl-o, Perfect ga-(Ø-)u-vl-i-a (ra+me-
       ze, as in xanjal-ze xel-i g a - r ø - ) i - v l - o / m o - ( Ø - ) i - v l - o / c ' a - ( Ø - ) i - v l - o   'X
       snatched hold of his dagger'. Note the formally bivalent intransitive form of this verb
       with m o - in the handy expression mag sa+km+e-s mo-(Ø-)e-vl-eb-a, da-(Ø-)
       m š v i d - d - i ! 'that matter will get sorted out, calm down!', where there is no
       Nominative subject external to the verb. This form can also be used (i) in the šense of
       'land on top of' (viz. mt'red-i tav-ze mo-(Ø-)e-vl-o bič'-s                           'the pigeon landed on
       the lad's head') and (ii) as a parallel to the form with preverb š e - m o - in the
                                       VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                           519    expression for 'encircle' (viz. jar-i rk'al-i-vit (gar+s) ( š ) m o - g v - e - v l - o         š
    mo-gv-e-rt'q'-a 'the army surrounded us like a circle'). The expression tav-
    s/tav-ze š e - m o - g - e - v l - e is used as an expression of affection, especially by a
    parent or elder to a child, from the traditional belief that moving round a troubled
    person takes that person's suffering away: cf. g - e - n a + c v + a l - e 'darling' (lit. 'I
    changed places with you') or šen-i č'ir-i me [gad-mo-m-i-vid-e-sj                     'darling' (lit.
    'your woe upon me [may it come overj').
232
    The Aorist is Weak: gan-v-(Ø-)vl-e(-t), gan-(Ø-Ø-)vl-e(-t), gan-(Ø-)vl-es.
233 Also possible (with 3rd person Nominative subject) is (Ø-)e-jd-om-eb-a, though this
    form (along with the variant (Ø-)e-)d-om-il-eb-a ) is perhaps more frequent as an
    Indirect Verb, used in the Prešent Sub-Series only, in the šense of 'X has a hankering
    to sit down' (e.g. ra m-e-jd-om-(il-)eb-a, kal-o, xom bevr-i sa+km+e m-a-
    kv-s? 'why should I want to sit down, woman, I have a lot of things to do, don't I ?').
234 Also used substantivally in the šense of 'bottom'.
235 less common in da-sa-jd-om-el-i (with syncopating - e - ).
236 In speech (Ø-)u-dg-a is possible.
237 The Prešent Sub-Series Indirect Verb meaning 'X is able to stand' (usually negated) is
    (Ø-)e-dg-om-eb-a or ( Ø - ) e - d g - o m - i l - e b - a   or   (Ø-)e-dg-om-in-eb-a (e.g.
    p'art'izan-ta rig-eb-ši               ar (Ø-)e-dg-om-eb-od-a          'X was not able to
    stand/remain in the ranks of the partisans').
238 The I I I r d Series may also be based on the preverbless Masdar of (da-)(Ø-Ø-)dg-
    am 'you put X/them in a standing position', namely dg-m-a , to give v-(Ø-)dg-m-i-
    v-a+r, v-(Ø-)dg-m-od-i, v-(Ø-)dg-m-od-e etc...
239 An indirect object may be added without any versioniser (e.g. sp'ilo mt'er-s pex-
    eb-it š s - d g - e b - a da sul da-(Ø-)č'q'let'-s        'an elephant will stand on its enemy
     with its feet and completely squash it').
240 Is the root -c'ev- or should it rather be -c'+ev- ?
241 unlike the equivalent Stative roots 'be seated' and 'be standing' KEGl quotes no
    parallel Indirect Verb for this root with such a šense as 'X can/wants to be lying'.
242 Note that pursuit of some activity without any reference within the verb to a
    recipient requires the use in the Prešent Sub-Series of the bivalent Intransitive form
    of this root (e.g. xalx-i gan+ma+tav+is+up+1+eb+el om-s (Ø-)e-c'-ev-a
     imp'erializm-is c'ina+ag+m+deg 'the people are engaged in a war of liberation
    against imperialism'), and yet outside the Prešent Sub-Series Transitive forms are
    employed (viz. agit'acia-s ga-(Ø-)s-c'-ev-s//agit'acia ga-(Ø-)s-c'-i-a                         a+m
    k'andidat'-is sa+sa+rg+eb+1+o-d 'X will//did engage in agitation in favour of this
    candidate').
243 This is also used as a substantive equivalent to login-i 'bed' = sa+jil+e.
244 Is the root -dev-/-)ev- or should it be -d+ev-/-)+ev-?
245 Not to be confused with s-d-ev-s (Aorist s-d-i-a , with no Series III) 'X follows
     after Y/them'.
246 Cf. ga-mo-m-c-em-el-i with syncopating vowel 'publisher',               ga-mo-m-c-em-1-oba
     'publishing house'.
247 If this is 'knowing' in the šense of wisšen, savoir, (ga-XØ-Ø-)i-cn-ob 'you (will)
     know (person(s))' is used in the šense of kennen, connaître.
248 Cf. the derived noun uc'q'+i+s-i 'official list of names', and the verbs sa+oc+ar
     ambav-s (Ø-)gv-a-uc'q'-eb-en 'they are informing/will                 inform us of surprising
     news', k'oresp'ondent'-i (Ø-)i-uc'q'-eb-a, rom...                'the correspondent reports
     that...', inglis-is m+k'itx+v+el sa+zog+ad+o+eba-s (Ø-)e-uc'q'-a rom... 'it was
     reported to the English reading public that...', for which last verb-form no Series III
     exists.
249 N.B. the derived adjective u-v+i+c-i 'ignorant', which gives the abstract noun u-
     v+i+c-oba 'ignorance'. Cf. u-c+od+in-ar-i 'ignorant, uneducated' => u-c+od+in-
     ar-oba 'ignorance'.
52Ø                                 GEORGI AN GRAMMAR250 Do not confuse this verb with the Indirect Verb (še-)g-e-cod-eb-i 'you (will) pity
    me'.
251 From vin (Ø-)i-c-i-s?            'Who knows?' is derived the complex conjunction
    vin+i+c+oba+a 'if perchance, in case'.
252 N.B. da-tk-m-ul dro-s 'at the appointed time', š t k - m - u l - e b a 'plot', gada-tk-m-
    a 'gainsaying, renouncing'.
253 Note the semantic difference between such pairs as: a-rč-e-ul(-i) i-kn-a vs a-rč-
    e-ul-i i-q'+o : the former is dynamic 'X was elected (e.g. in the election)' vs the
     latter which is the stative 'X was (in a state of having been) elected'. However, in an
     article in literary Georgia (1 June 199Ø, p.5) by Zurab Sardzhveladze we see that in
     speaking on two occasions of one and the same event (viz. the invention of the Greek
     alphabet) he employs in the first instance the copula plus Past Participle, whilst in the
     second he utilises the dynamic passive of the same verb, which in this case is of the
     synthetic type.         The first example is: sa+varaud+o-a,                   rom berjn+ul-i
     da+m+c'er+1+oba p'ir+v+el-i at+as+c*l+eul-is mi+jn+a-ze i-q'-o-s                             škmn-
     il-i 'it is to be supposed that Greek writing was created on the threshold of the first
     mIIIennium [sc. B.C.j' vs (Ø-)varaud-ob-en, rom e+s                         tav+da+p'ir+v+el-i
     berjn + ul-i        an+ban-i         u+nd+a š e - k m n - i l - i - q ' + o e r t + o b + l + i v - i
     Se+mo+km+ed+eb-is Je+deg+ad 'they suppose that this proto-type Greek
     alphabet must have been created as the result of joint creativity'.
254 This is rather reminiscent of the construction with ga-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-šv-i kal-i                      'you
     let the womanNOM go'-
255 This word is also used in the šense of m+xed+v+el+oba 'sight' (cf. also the phrase
     m+xed+v+el+oba-ši mi-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-eb                 'you         will       take      X/them       into
     view/consideration'). Cf. also xed-i 'sight = what is in vision, view', for which
     sa+nax+a+oba is also used, though this latter may also mean 'something worth
     seeing'.
256 This verb-form may also mean 'get better (in health)' (e.g. av+ad+m+q'+op-ma m o -
     (?Ø-)i-xed-a = mo-(?Ø-)i-k*et-a = av+ad+m+q'+op-i u+k'et ga-xd-a 'the sick
     person got better').
257 Also possible are i-nax-v-eb-a and the older pattern i-nax-v-i-s
258 N.B. (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)i-xil-av 'you (will) examine your own X(s)', which contrasts with the
     specific meaning attaching to the older form of this preverb seen in (gan-)(Ø-Ø-)i-
     xil-av 'you (will) examine/discuss X/them'.
259 As a noun q'ur-i = 'ear'.
260 When used with this i-suffix, as it more usually is, the Imperfect is formed by -od- .
261
     Cf. (mi-)(Ø-Ø-)a-čer-d-eb-i         = (mi-)(Ø-Ø-)a-šter-d-eb-i              (Aorist mi-(Ø-Ø-)a-
     čer-d-i = mi-(Ø-Ø-)a-št'er-d-i , Perfect mi-(Ø-)s-čer-eb-i-x-a+r                          = mi-(Ø-
     Ø-)št'er-eb-i-x-a+r ). Cf. the formal Perfect š ( Ø - ) s - č e r - e b - i - x - a + r , which is
     used only as a Prešent Indicative in the meaning 'you stare fixedly at X/them' (with
     the formal Pluperfect še-(Ø-)s-čer-eb-od-i and III rd Subjunctive                    še-(Ø-)s-čer-
     eb-od-e being used as Imperfect Indicative and Prešent Subjunctive respectively.
262 Mingrelian has a Thematic Suffix -an- (e.g. r - t i r - a n - s 'X changes you').
263 The animate root is used when the object is a car, when used as a synonym for the
     verb in (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c'-ev mo+sa+val-s           'you (will) gather in the harvest', and
     when the object is 'example' (e.g. še+sa+per-i(s-i) magalit-i mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'van-e
     'you adduced an apposite example').
264 Note how the expression 'who among you' is formed, namely by associating the
      interrogative pronoun with a 2nd person form of the verb. For a verb close in
     meaning to the one IIIustrated cf. (da-)(Ø-Ø-)e-bgauč'-eb-i                 'you (will) cling onto
     X/them' (e.g. bavšv-i ded-is k'alta-s            (Ø-)e-bgauč'-eb-od-a                'the child was
      clinging onto its mother's hem').
265 Cf. (da-)(Ø-)s-jer-d-eb-i ra-s-me           = (da-)(Ø-)k'ma+q'+op+il-d-eb-i r-iti-me
      'you are (will be) satisfied with something'.

    One would perhaps prescriptively have expected the last clause to read še-(Ø-)g-a-
    xved+r-a ¿em-i tav-i with the 1st person direct object transformed into the 3rd
    person periphrasis, allowing the (2nd) person marker remaining in the verb to
    correlate with the indirect object, but perhaps Vazha Pshavela here prefers the 1st
    person affix in the verb to keep the focus of attention on the 1st person direct
    object, who is the beneficiary of this chance-meeting. In place of a Dative indirect
    object with this verb one may also find the relevant nominal being governed by the
    postposition -tan.
267 Not to be confused with ga-(Ø-)jex-i(-t) 'satiate yourself.
268 Also cognate are the verbs (Ø-Ø-)s-jgvn-i 'you (will) prešent X/them to Y/them as a
    gift' and in the Prešent Sub-Series only (Ø-Ø-)s-)gvn-ob 'you convey gift/greeting
    X to Y/them'.
269
    In the second IIIustration offered by KEGl (vol. VIII) the meaning is rather 'agree
    with X on Y' with two Dative nominals (viz. gio tamasuk-is da+c'er+a-ši ert
    katam-s (?Ø-)gv-jer-d-eb-a 'in writing a note acknowledging the debt Gio comes
    to agreement with us on one chicken'), for which meaning KEGl gives the gloss h-
    q'abul-d-eb-i , though the only example for this verb where the entity agreed upon
    is stated has it not in the Dative but governed by -ze (viz. da-h-q'abul-d-a at
    tuman-ze 'X agreed with Y on ten tenners').
270 In response to the greeting ro+gora x-a+r-t? 'How are you?' one may say tkven
    ro+gor g-i-k'itx-o-t? as the translation-equivalent of 'And how are you?.
271 Cf. ma-txov-ar-i (with syncopating suffixal vowel) or ma-txov-ar-a (Genitive in
    -ar-a-s ) 'beggar'.
272 Recall that this is the regular Aorist conjugation for the root, as in (ga-mo-)(Ø-Ø-
    Ø-)a-k'l-eb 'you (will) subtract X/them from Y/them'.
273 E.g. ded-is juju maga-s š ( Ø - ) r g - e b - i - a                 'X's mother's breast evidently did X
    some good'.
274 E.g. m - k ' b - e n - a r - a jagl-i/k'b+il-i            'biting dog/tooth' vs m-c'ixl-av-s c'in da-
    (Ø-)u-dg-eb-i-an,              m - k ' b - e n - a r - s uk'ana-o 'they will stand in front of a kicker
    and behind a biter, they say'.
275 N.B. t'uš-ze/tit-ze (Ø-?Ø-)i-k'b-en                         'you (will) bite yourself on the lip/finger in
    realisation and regret at something' vs ena-ze (Ø-?Ø-)i-k'b-en                             'you (will) bite
     yourself on the tongue to stop yourself saying anything further'.
276 For a more regular formation in perfective screeves consider the form in the
    proverb: buz-i rom tav-ze da-g-bzu-i-s, k'ogo-c maä+in da-g-k'b-en-s-o
    'While the fly is buzzing around your head, the mosquito too will then bite you, they
    say'.
277 Also heard, though condemned by prescriptivists, is (Ø-Ø-)i-a+xl-eb-i.
278 Without preverb this verb-form means 'mention': N.B. the saying when someone
    hiccups vin g-a-xs+en-eb-s? 'who is mentioning you?' (= vi-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)a-gon-
     d-i? 'who has recalled you?'). With ga- or š                       the verb-form means 'remind X/them
     of Y/them' (e.g. da+vic'q'+eb+ul-i da+p'ir+eb+a š / g a - ( Ø - Ø - Ø - ) a - x s + e n - e
     direkt'or-s 'remind the director of (his) forgotten promise').
279 This is the Causative of (da-)(Ø-Ø-)?s-c-em 'you (will) knock X/them down', and the
     obligatory noun in this expression for 'sneeze' is cxvir-i 'nose'.
280 This example from D. Mačxaneli is quoted in KEGl under d a a m t k n a r e b s .
281 This is in addition to a separate synthetic form that corresponds inGEORGIANto a
     Transitive Verb in the Imperfect Indicative but with an indirect object alongside the
     direct object (e.g. from the lashkh dialect x-(Ø-Ø-)a-gm-ina""-x-i =GEORGIAN(Ø-Ø-
     Ø-)u-šen-eb-d-i t u r m e 'you were building X/them for Y/them apparently').
282 Note how the Prešent-Stative formant - i - is treated as part of the root here.
283 Such is the form prešented by Topuria on pp. 132-133, but on p. 135 the same Svan

language is reasonably straightforward. Its subordinate clauses, unlike
those of North Caucasian languages, do not differ markedly from the
familiar structures of typical Indo-European languages with their use of
conjunctions plus interplay of indicative and subjunctive finite verb-forms.
However, so that those interested in syntax can approach this chapter
without necessarily having to work through all the detail prešented in the
preceding chapters (especially Chapter 4), I now include a short resumé of
the non-syntactic component ofGEORGIANgrammar.","[525, 526, 527, 528, 529, 530, 531, 532, 533, 534, 535, 536, 537, 538, 539, 540, 541, 542]"

9/1Ø. In order to give a flavour of the difference between Old and Modern
GEORGIANI have chošen a text that exists in both, namely the Bible—
specifically chapter 1Ø verses 17-22 & 25 from the Gospel according to St.
Mark. The OldGEORGIANversion is taken from the oldest dated manuscript
for theGEORGIANGospels, namely the Adysh Codex (manuscript C), which is
dated 897 and takes its name from the small vIIIage in Svanetia where the
manuscript was discovered. The manuscript was published in 1945 by
Ak'ak'i Shanidze. The modern translation below was published in 1982 by
the Institute for Bible Translation in Stockholm.",[697]

There is a great variety of strategies available to convey a fear. Perhaps
the simplest way to express a positive fear is to use the appropriate tense
of the indicative, preferably accompanied by the speech-particle and also
by either vai-tu 'woe if' or xom ar 'surely not?', e.g.     m-e-šin-i-a,       vai-tu rus-eb-i
     I-IOV-fear-PRES-it          Russian-Pl-NOM
     šmo-gv-e-s-ev-i-an(=me+tk+i)
     PREV-PREV-us-IOV-attack-TS-INDIC(FUT)-they(-SP.PART)
62Ø                       GEORGIANGRAMMAR   / / gv-e-s-ev-i-an(-me+tk+i) / /        še-mo-gv-e-s-iv-
                                          nen(=me+tk+i)
       PRES                               AOR
   'I am afraid that the Russians will attack us // may be attacking us //
   may have attacked us'which may be alternatively expressed by replacing vai-tu by xom ar
placed after the SUBJect rus-eb-i. These two variants, which are based
on direct quotation, sit happily alongside any tense in the introductory
verb, so that replacing m-e-šin-i-a above by the past m-e-šin-od-a
would give the equivalents of 'I was afraid the Russians would attack us //
were attacking us // had attacked us'.
    An alternative is to turn the fearing clause into a negative wish (sc.
that something may not happen or may not be happening), which joins the
negative particle ar to the appropriate SUBJunctive (viz. Aorist for an
event in the future vs Prešent for one contemporaneous with the fear).
Such expressions may optionally be introduced by the complementiser rom
and optionally accompanied by the relevant speech-particle. The above-
example in this variation would be:   m-e-šin-i-a,     (rom)                    rus-eb-i           ar
   še-mo-gv-e-s-i-o-n(=me+tk+i) / /           gv-e-s-e-od-nen(=me+tk+i)

    'I am afraid lest your thinking too be corrupted'16   Note that this strategy is not available if the feared event precedes the
moment the fear itself is being expressed. In the case of a simple fear for
the future after a non-past main verb the Future Indicative, with or
without rom, is possible, e.g.      m-e-šin-i-a, (rom) rus-eb-i še-mo-gv-e-s-ev-i-an
      'I am afraid the Russians will attack us'

    'I am afraid I shall not find you to be the kind of ones 1 wish'17    After a past tense introductory verb a fear relating to the future
relative to the expression of that fear may be expressed by ar 'not'
accompanying the Pluperfect Indicative without any speech-particle; the
complementiser rom is optional, e.g.   m-e-šin-od-a,     (rom)   rus-eb-i     ar  še-mo-gv-s-e-od-nen

conveys a fear that something may happen / / may be happening // may

happening / / have happened, then the complementiser rom is preferably
retained with the negative ar and a non-SUBJunctive verb in the
appropriate tense (apart from the Pluperfect), e.g.

being replaceable by the (non-negated) Prešent SUBJunctive. If the negated

"1.8 Scope of the present workThough the general linguist will, I trust, find in the following pages
whatever he may desire to know about the workings of the Georgian
language, as it now stands this book represents my attempt to consign to
paper in the form of a fully-fledged reference grammar all the knowledge
of (as well as, I hope, the odd insight into) this challenging language that I
have acquired over the last twenty years of close study. Because of the
                              INTRODUCTION                                 15structure of the language it is no accident that the largest chapter below is
that devoted to the morphology of the verb. However, I have endeavoured
to give the fullest possible information also about the language's syntax,
since this is an area that is often cursorily treated, especially by native
linguists in the Caucasus.       The chapter on syntax begins with a
recapitulation of the essentials of the overall properties of the language
discussed in chapters 3 and 4, so that those primarily interested in
questions of syntax might be able to derive some benefit from the syntactic
descriptions presented in chapter 5 without necessarily having to master
all of the complex morphology that precedes them.
    With the publication of my course-book for Georgian in twenty lessons
for Routledge (1995b) and the imminent appearance of my Georgian Reader
(SOAS), I now draw this chapter in my linguistic endeavours to a close,
leaving it to others to work on this language in the certainty that its future
is fully secure; henceforth I shall concentrate on at least two of the
languages in the Caucasus about whose future the same happy prediction
can sadly not be made, namely Abxaz and Mingrelian—the irony is, one
could argue, that it is in the very success of Georgian that the threat to
these languages and cultures lies.","[33, 34]"
"'Want' (2nd person subject)
In place of the direct g-i-nd-a-t 'you want X/them' (an Indirect Verb) we
regularly find the root -neb- especially in such expressions as ra g-neb-
av-t? 'what do you want?', ro+gor+c g-neb-av-t 'as you wish' (again
Indirect). The Transitive form of the root ((Ø-Ø-)i-neb-eb 'you (will)
conceive a desire for X/them' => Aorist (Ø-Ø-)i-neb-e, Perfect g-i-neb-
eb-i-a) is itself a polite alternative to (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-nd + o m - e b =
(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-sur+v-eb; it is especially common as the translation-
equivalent of 'please help yourself/yourselves' when offering a guest food
or drink, namely (Ø-Ø-)i-neb-e-t, with its own polite synonym in mi-(Ø-
Ø-)i-rtv-i-t—cf. (mi-i-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-rtm-ev 'you (will) hand X/them to
Y/them' vs (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)m-a-rtm-ev 'you (will) pass X/them to me'.
                            VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                           4974.10.3 Variable Actant Marking
The root -)in-, construed with either da- or c'a- as preverb, can be used
in two ways to convey the concept of 'going to sleep': the verb can be
formally Transitive, as in bavšv-ma t'k'b+il-ad ča-(?Ø-)i-)in-a 'the
child fell sweetly to sleep' (=> Perfect bavšv-s ča-(Ø-)u-)in-i-a), or
alternatively the root may take the shape of an Indirect Verb, as in
baväv-s t'k'b+il-ad ča-(Ø-)e-)in-a 'the child fell sweetly to sleep' (=>
Perfect bavšv-s ča-s-)in-eb-i-a). Similarly the antonym -gvij-, with
either ga- or ga-mo- as preverb, can be construed either Transitively or
as an Indirect Verb in the meaning 'wake up/sober up' (e.g. b a v š v - m a
xma+ur+oba-ze ga-(mo-)(?Ø-)i-gvij-a 'the child woke at the noise' (=>
Perfect baväv-s ga-(mo-)(Ø-)u-gvij-(n-)i-a) = bavšv-s xma+ur-
+oba-ze ga-(mo-)(Ø-)e-gvij-a (=> Perfect baväv-s ga-(mo-)(Ø-)
gvij-eb-i-a).
    In the case of the root -tvlem- 'snooze, slumber', although the c a š
marking of the snoozer varies in the same way as in the previous two
example-roots, the actual shape of the verb itself only varies between
Transitive and Indirect in Series III. Transitively we have: mo+x+u+c-i
(ča-)tvlem-s 'the old man is snoozing/will fall into a snooze' vs Aorist
mo+x+u+c-ma ča-(?Ø-)tvlim-a vs Perfect mo+x+u+c-s ša-(Ø-)u-
tvlem-i-a; the alternative paradigm is: mo+x+u+c-s (ča-)(s-)tvlem-s
'the old man is snoozing/will fall into a snooze' vs Aorist mo+x+u+c-s ča-
(s-)tvlim-a vs Perfect mo+x+u+c-s ča-(s-)tvlem-i-a. It is difficult to
detect any difference in meaning between the three pairs from the
examples given in KEGl. However, in the case of some other verbs
describing bodily functions, it is perhaps possible to point to a semantic
distinction.
    In the example cocxal-i adam+ian-i an cxvir-s da-(?Ø-?Ø-?Ø)a-
c-em-in-eb-s 2 7 9    an da-(?Ø-)a-mtknar-eb-s da an a-mo-(?Ø-)a-
slok'in-eb-s 'a living person either will sneeze or yawn or again produce
a hiccup' 28Ø .    All three verbs are formally Transitive with the
sneezer/yawner/hiccuper in the Nominative case as subject of a Transitive
Verb in the Future Indicative. If these verbs were in a Series II screeve,
the subject would be Ergative, but this is not so in the following example:
p'ap'a-s sc'ore+d a+m dro-s cxvir-s da-(?Ø-?Ø-)a-c-em-in-a 'it
was precisely at this time that the priest sneezed', where the sneezer is in
the Dative. Perhaps the context is hinting that the sneeze came at an
embarrassing moment for the priest, so that to underline the non-deliberate
nature of the act, the sneezer is made indirect object, leaving the subject
(Nature, God, Providence?) and direct object, though cross-referenced in
498                           GEORGIANGRAMMARthe verb, actually undefined. It would follow from this that the normal
subject-marking for Transitive Verbs assigned to the noun 'person' in the
first example is to suggest that these are deliberate acts that one might
expect from 'the living person'. We can also have indirect-object marking
for yawners and hiccupers (e.g. tu jil-i mo-g-e-r-ev-a, albat da-
(?Ø-)g-a-mtknar-eb-?s 'if sleep gets the better of you, you will probably
yawn' vs without preverb bavSv-s mtel-i sa+gam+o (?Ø-Ø-)a-mtknar-
?a 'the baby had a fit of yawning the whole evening'; p'armen-s (?Ø-
Ø-)a-slok'in-?a mtel-i dge 'P'armen had an attack of the hiccups the
whole day'). Similarly for 'coughing' we have both the Transitive ekim-is
txov+n-it bavšv-ma da-(?Ø-)a-xvel-a 'at the request of the doctor
the child coughed' vs the alternative inglis+el-s da-(?Ø-Ø-)a-xvel-a,
roca araq'-ma q'el-i da-(Ø-)s-c'v-a 'the Englishman coughed when the
vodka burnt his throat'. For 'belching' it seems that only the Indirect
method is possible, as in m+s+m+el-s da-(?Ø-Ø-)a-boq'in-a 'the drinker
belched'. According to the dictionaries [KEGl and Tschenkčli), in Series
III the verbs prešented for 'sneezing', 'yawning', 'hiccuping', 'coughing' and
'belching' permit only the Transitive forms, so that the Perfects are
respectively: (da-)(Ø-)u-c-em-in-eb-i-a, (da-)(Ø-)u-mtknar-eb-i-a,
(a-mo-)(Ø-)u-slok'in-eb-i-a, d a - ( Ø - ) u - x v e l - e b - i - a , d a - ( Ø - ) u -
boq'in-eb-i-a. An alternative root for 'sneeze', -cxik'v-, is Transitive
throughout (viz. (da-)(Ø-?Ø-)a-cxik , v-eb 'you (will) sneeze' => Aorist
(da-)(Ø-?Ø-)a-cxik'v-e => Perfect ( d a - ) g - i - c x i k ' v - e b - i - a ) . For
'snoring' we have the Medial Verb (Ø-)xvrin-av 'you snore' => Future (Ø-
?Ø-)i-xvrin-eb => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-xvrin-e => Perfect g-i-xvrin-i-a.
For 'spitting' the verb is a normal Transitive, as seen in the proverb a-v-
(?Ø-)a-purtx-e—ulvaš-s mo-(Ø-)xvd-a, da-v-(?Ø-)a-purtx-e—
c ' v e r - e b - s a - o 'I spat upwards—it caught (my) moustache, I spat
downwards—(it caught my) beard, they say'; similarly for 'urinating'
((mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)šard-av or (mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)ps-am) and 'defalcating'
((mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)jv-am).
      We have fluctuation between the direct and indirect construction with
the formally bivalent Intransitive Verb 'be worthy of', as seen in the
contrasting syntax of: ro+di+s (Ø-)e-gir+s-eb-od-nen i+s+i+n-i a+m
si+k'et+e-s, rom ar q'+op-il-i-q'+o m+c'er+al-ta k'avšir-i? 'when

been a union of Writers?', which construction is seen again in this quote
from Vazha Pshavela: k'ide+v v-(Ø-)e-gir+s-e ga+zapxul-s 'I again
was worthy (of seeing) the spring', but in the next quote from
C'avč'avadze the c a š m a r k i n g of the arguments is reversed: c'minda-a

do*.
     Another kind of fluctuation has been examined by Tuite (1987; 1993).
He points out the subtle difference between such verbal usages as: deda
bavšv-eb-s (Ø-)a-int'eres-eb-s zgap'r-eb-it 'the mother is keeping
the children interested with fairty-tales' (the plurality of the direct object
is not marked on the verb) vs bavšv-eb-s (Ø-)a-int'eres-eb-t zgap'r-
eb-i 'the children are interested in fairy-tales' (where, he argues, the
morphological direct object is treated as the syntactic subject and thus
now does have its plurality marked on the verb). We then have in contrast
to the latter an inceptive formation: bavšv-eb-i int'eres-d-eb-i-an
zgap'r-eb-it 'the children are getting interested in fairy-tales'. In Series
III both the latter constructions are permissible for this verb, giving in the
Perfect: zgap'r-eb-s da-(Ø-)u-int'eres-eb-i-a bavšv-eb-i 'fairy-tales
have interested the children' vs bavšv-eb-i                 da-int'eres-eb-ul-an
zgap'r-eb-it 'the children have become interested in fairy-tales'.
Consider now such verbs as: (da-)(Ø-)a-elm-eb-s 'X makes/will make
Y/them cross-eyed', (da-i-(Ø-)a-k'ut'-eb-s = (da-)(Ø-)a-sap'q'r-eb-s 'X
makes/will make Y/them crippled', (ga-)(Ø-)a-p'ir+kuš-eb-s 'X puts/will
put Y/them in a bad mood', (ga-)(Ø-)a-rind-eb-s 'X makes/will make
Y/them mute', (ag-)(Ø-)a-t'q'in-eb-s 'X makes/will make Y/them ecstatic',
(da-)(Ø-)a-pikr+ian-eb-s 'X makes/will make Y/them pensive', (ag-)(Ø-)
a-prt+ovan-eb-s 'X thrIIIs/will thrIII Y/them', (a-)(Ø-)a-caxcax-eb-s
'X makes/will make Y/them tremble', (mo-)(Ø-)tent-av-s 'X relaxes/will
relax Y/them'. These verbs are paralleled by Intransitive forms like: (da-)
(Ø-)elm-d-eb-i 'you (will) become cross-eyed', (da-)(Ø-)k'ut'-d-eb-i =
(da-)(Ø-)sap'q'r-d-eb-i 'you (will) become crippled', (mo-)(Ø-)i-tent-
eb-i 'you are being/will be relaxed' etc... Whilst one would expect both
Transitive and Intransitive paradigms to be complete across the three
screeve-series, it seems from Tuite's work that, in his words: 'speakers
appear not to regard these parallel forms as composing two separate
paradigms, but rather as elements of a single paradigm with a degree of
morphological and syntactic variability in it' (1993.6). Though speaker-
judgments differ somewhat among themselves and for different verbs, Tuite
found that for the verb 'make/become cross-eyed', the Transitive
construction was preferred in the Prešent Sub-Series (viz. g-a-elm-eb-s
'X (say, watching TV) makes you cross-eyed' is better than
(Ø-)elm-d-eb-i 'you go cross-eyed (from watching TV)', with - g a n
expressing the cause), whereas in the Future Sub-Series the preference
shifted to the Intransitive variant (viz. Future da-(Ø-)elm-d-eb-i) though
the Transitive ( d a - g - a - e l m - e b - s ) is stIII acceptable; in Series II
5ØØ                          GEORGIANGRAMMARpreference for the Intransitive (Aorist da-(Ø-)elm-d-i) was so strong as
to make the Transitive (da-g-a-elm-a) questionable, whilst in Series III
only the Intransitive (Perfect da-(Ø-)elm-eb-ul-x-a+r vs Transitive da-
(Ø-Ø-)u-elm-eb-i-x-a+r) seemed permissible at all.","[515, 516, 517, 518, 519]"
"5.2.2.1.4.1 Real Conditionals
The conjunction tu 'if' usually occupies the first position in the protasis,
although it may also stand after the clause's first constituent. The
appropriate non-SUBJunctive screeve is used in both protasis and apodosis,

Intransitive Verb with Nominative subject in all Series, with Series III
screeves based on the Past Participle in -eb-ul- (the usual ending for
verbs with Thematic Suffix -eb), and with the possible use of Objective
Version where appropriate. The radical stem for the inceptive is in almost
all cases precisely that taken by the Medial outside the Prešent Sub-Series.
And so, from sub-group 4 (the first of the non-derived Medial groups) the
root - s i s + i n - 'hiss' does not alter across the Series, which gives the
inceptive: (Ø-)sis+in-d-eb-i 'you start hissing' => Future a-(Ø-)sis+in-d-
eb-i => Aorist a-(Ø-)sis+in-d-i => Aorist Subjunctive a-(Ø-)sis+in-d-e
=> Perfect a-(Ø-)sis+in-eb-ul-x-a+r => Pluperfect a-(Ø-)sis+in-eb-ul-
(Ø-)i-q'av-i. But the root - ž g i v - 'twitter' does alter with Prešent
(Ø-)žgiv-i and Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-žgiv+l-eb, and from this latter the
inceptive is (a-)(Ø-žgiv+l-d-eb-i 'you (will) start twittering'. Similarly we
                                    VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                                        351have z m u - i - s 'X moos' => Future (?Ø-)i-zmu + v l - e b - s => inceptive
(a-)zmu+vl-d-eb-a. Holisky gave three roots of this sub-class where the
inceptive diverges slightly from the Future stem insofar as the inceptive
stem is taken from the Masdar (namely: (?Ø-)i-bzu+vl-eb-s 'X will buzz'
=> inceptive (a-)bzu+il-d-eb-a; (?Ø-)i-š-xu+vl-eb-s 'X will rustle' =>
inceptive ( a - ) š x u + i l - d - e b - a ; ( ? Ø - ) i - c ' u + v l - e b - s 'X will buzz' =>
inceptive (a-)c'u+il-d-eb-a).
    From sub-group 5 formations are entirely regular (e.g. p'r+ial-eb-s 'X
gleams' => Future (?Ø-)i-p'r+ial-eb-s => inceptive (a-)p'r+ial-d-eb-a;
k'rt-i-s 'X shimmers' => Future ( ? Ø - ) i - k ' r t + o l - e b - s => inceptive
(a-)k'rt+ol-d-eb-a).
    From sub-group 6 we have such examples as: (Ø-)k'ank'al-eb 'you
quiver' => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-k'ank'al-eb => inceptive (a-)(Ø-)k'ank'al-d-
eb-i (with Objective Version tval-eb-i a-g-i-k'ank'al-d-a 'your eyes
started fluttering'); (Ø-)trt-i 'you tremble' => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-trt+ol-eb
=> inceptive (a-)(Ø-)trt+ol-d-eb-i). Occasionally a different preverb will
be found, as in t ' i v t ' i v - e b - s 'X floats, bobs about' => Future (?Ø-)i-
t'ivt'iv-eb-s => inceptive (a-mo-)t'ivt'iv-d-eb-a.
    In the case of sub-group 7, since these verbs indicate change of
locality by some means of movement, the inceptives occur with a variety of
preverbs, determined by the direction of the movement. Also the meaning
is not necessarily 'start to...' (e.g. gor-av-s 'X rolls' => Future (?Ø-)i-gor-
eb-s => 'inceptive' gor-d-eb-a 'X changes location by rolling' => ga-gor-
d-eb-a 'X will roll out' vs äe-mo-gor-d-eb-a 'X will come rolling in' vs
gada-gor-d-eb-a 'X will roll across' etc.).
    For the weather-verbs of sub-group 8 Holisky quotes the inceptives: a-
grux + u n - d - e b - a (not in KEGl) and a - k u x - d - e b - a 'it will start
thundering', ga-tov-d-eb-a 'it will start snowing', ga-rižraž-d-eb-a
'day will break', ga-c'vim-d-eb-a 'it will start raining'.
    From the residual sub-group 9 some roots form inceptives but not
always with a-, whilst others do not. Examples: dug-s 'it boils' => Future
(?Ø-)i-dug-eb-s => inceptive (a-)dug-d-eb-a; (Ø-(Ø-))pikr-ob 'you
think (something)' => Future (Ø-Ø-)i-pikr-eb => inceptive (da-)(Ø-)pikr-
d-eb-i; (Ø-)c'ux-[x-]a+r 'you are unhappy' 92 => Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-c'ux-
eb => inceptive (s-e-)(Ø-)c'ux-d-eb-i (N.B. the common expression,
usually with s-prefix, nu še-(Ø-)s-c'ux-d-eb-i 'don't put yourself to any
trouble (sc. over it)!').
    In the case of the first two sub-groups of Medials, derived from nouns
and adjectives, Holisky argues that any inceptive formation such as
(ga-)(Ø-)me+p-d-eb-i 'you (will) become king' (cf. m e + p + e 'king',
(Ø-)me+p-ob 'you reign'), (da-)(Ø-)o]ax-d-eb-i 'you (will) start a family'
352                        GEORGIANGRAMMAR(cf. ojax-i 'family', (Ø-)ojax-ob 'you are a family-man'), etc... are based
not on the Medial but are derived straight from the relevant root. She
points out that the preverb in such cases is usually ga- or da- (as against
a-) and that a number of such formations exist where there is no Medial
counterpart (e.g. (ga-)(Ø-)c'itl-d-eb-i 'you (will) blush' <= c'itel-i 'red',
for which there is no *(Ø-)c'itl-ob).","[369, 370, 371]"

In modern Georgian adnominal Genitives almost always precede their heads
and do not alter in any way as the head declines in either the singular or
plural. Old Georgian, however, placed adnominal Genitives after their
heads, and the head's case-ending was repeated in full (except for the
Adverbial) after the Genitive desinence. The following example, based on
Shanidze (1976:44), is for the phrase 'house of timber':     Case                   Singular                    Plural
     NOMINATIVE             saxl-i jel-isa-y            saxl-n-i jel-isa-n-i
     VOCATIVE               saxl-o jel-isa-o            saxl-n-o jel-isa-n-o
     DATIVE                 saxl-s(a) jel-isa-s(a)      saxl-t(a) jel-isa-t(a)
     ERGATIVE               saxl-man jel-isa-man        saxl-t(a) jel-isa-t(a)
     GENITIVE               saxl-is(a) jel-isa-ys(a)    saxl-t(a) jel-isa-t(a)
     INSTRUMENTAL           saxl-it(a) jel-isa-yt(a)    (saxl-t(a) jel-isa-t(a))
     ADVERBIAL              saxl-ad jel-isa(-d)         (saxl-t(a) jel-isa-t(a))    Modern Georgian may order the elements of NPs similarly in imitation
of the older pattern, and Shanidze gives (part of) the following declension,
where xe is 'tree, timber', as a modern equivalent of the same Old
Georgian phrase:

  ADVERBIAL                saxl-ad x-isa-d            saxl-eb-ad x-isa-d    Modern Georgian has no palatal glide, and so the head noun's
Nominative ending cannot be repeated; this also no doubt explains the
absence from the paradigm of such sequences when the head is either
Genitive or Instrumental, for here too the initial i-vowel of the
reduplicated endings should have been reduced to this same glide.
Differently from Old Georgian, when the head is Vocative, Ergative or
Adverbial, the form of the reduplicated case-ending is exactly what is
required for these cases by a-stem nouns. However, in my experience
such postposed adnominal Genitives are really only found today when the
head-noun is either Nominative or Dative. And so, most of the paradigm
just set out is somewhat artificial. However, it provides an analogue for
the creation of Georgian's so-called 'double declension'.
    In examples where we find a noun repeated with two (or more) different
adnominal Genitives, as in 'Zurab's father took the book, but Zviad's father
returned it', the word 'father' need not actually appear twice in either
English or Georgian. Whilst English merely drops it (to give 'Zurab's father
took the book, but Zviad's—returned it', where the dash marks the gapped
nominal), Georgian adds the case-marker appropriate to the gapped noun
onto the surviving adnominal Genitive. This example in Georgian would be:   zurab-is    mama-m        c'ign-i    c'a-(0-)i-g-o,
   Zurab-GEN father-ERG book-NOM PREV-(it-)SV-take-he(AOR)
   zviad-isa-m       [<= zviad-is    mama-m]    k'i
   Zviad-GEN-ERG [<= Zviad-GEN father-ERG] however
   da-(Ø-)a-brun-a
   PREV-(it-)NV-return-he(AOR)An example where the head is Dative would be:   na+tes+a+ob+it-is      porma     mi+c+em+it-isa-s

     [<= Dative-GEN        form-DAT] PREV-(it-)I OV-resemble-it(AOR)
     'the form of the Genitive came to resemble that of the Dative'   And so, we could set out just such a double-declension for the
expression 'that/those of the lad', where 'lad' = bič'-i:     Case                   Singular                   Plural
     NOMINATIVE             bič'-isa                   bič'-is-eb-i

     ADVERBI AL             bič'-isa-d(a)              bič'-is-eb-ad(a)   We have given concrete illustrations for the double declension where
the gapped head-noun is Ergative and Dative. Let us now exemplify a
gapped Nominative:     v-is-i         c'ign-i     c'a-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e?
     who-GEN-AGR book-NOM PREV-(you-it-)SV-take-AOR

     David-GEN(-NOM)
     'Whose book did you take? David's'      It looks here for all the world as though the final word were simply the
long form of the Genitive of this proper name. But this is not so—
underlyingly it is a sequence of GENITIVE-NOMINATIVE, where the
latter morpheme is realised by a zero morph. All nouns whose Genitive
singular ends in -is(a) will shew -isa in such contexts. But of course not all
nouns have a Genitive singular in -is(a)—some vowel-stems have their
Genitive singular, as detailed above, in -s(a), and all such will in the
context we are describing end in -s-i, where the final -i is nothing other
than the Nominative desinence of the gapped Nominative nominal (e.g. v-
is-i c'ign-i c'a-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e? šota-s-i/giorgi-s-i/uča-s-i/vano-s-
i / e l e n e - s - i 'Whose book did you take? (Lit. The one of)
Shota's/Giorgi's/Ucha's/Vano's/Helen's'). Nouns of this type exhibit the
following double declensional pattern, illustrated by the male proper name
vova:

paradigm based on the male names elguja and vano. Note that the full
form in -sa of the Genitive appears when the gapped noun stands in the
Ergative or Dative.","[60, 61, 62, 63, 64]"

Masdar), (ii) the Active (sometimes called Prešent) Participle, (iii) the Future
Participle, (iv) the Privative Participle, (v) the Past Participle. Not every
root will necessarily possess each of these forms. Version (with one
possible exception) has no role to play in non-finite forms, and no
agreement-markers occur here either. The non-finite forms of Irregular
Verbs are given together with all the other information about them in 4.1Ø.
The general description of, and relevant comments about, the four
participles will be prešented in sub-sections 4.9.2-4.9.5, which last sub­
section will then include particular details as they relate to the different
sub-types of verb and exemplification for all four participles of the
selected verbal roots, each selection beginning with the Masdar.
                           VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                           4234.9.1 Masdar (masdar-i)
This Arabic term is generally used to describe the verbal noun in
preference to Infinitive (sa+c'q'+is-i), as syntactically the formation
behaves like a noun rather than a verb, such that the object of a
Transitive Verb surfaces in the Genitive (just like any adnominal Genitive
qualifier of another noun)—one might equally well use the term 'gerund'.
OldGEORGIANdid possess an infinitive, which could use either of the direct
object cases (viz. the Nominative and Dative) to mark a Transitive Verb's
direct object (see Hewitt 1983b), and formally it was the Adverbial c a š
form of the Masdar.
    The formation of the Masdar for Transitive and Intransitive Verbs is
largely straightforward. Where a root exists in both a Transitive and an
Intransitive guise, there is usually only one shared Masdar, so that da-
brun-eb-a is the Masdar for both Transitive (da-)(Ø-Ø-)a-brun-eb 'you
(will) return X/them' and Intransitive (da-)(Ø-)brun-d-eb-i 'you (will)
return', e.g.   c'ign-is    da+brun+eb-isa-s             k'ar-ze xma+magl-a

returning set aside a bit [sc. u+k'vd+av+eb-is c'q'al-i = water of
immortalityj for me too'). A few Intransitives, however, have a separate,
special formation. Where a root normally combines with a preverb in the
perfective screeves, it is usually the case that the Masdar may be formed
with or without the relevant preverb depending on the aspect required (viz.
imperfective without preverb vs perfective with it), though it is not
uncommon to come across a sequence of Masdars dependent upon one and
the same verb where some are with preverb whilst others are preverbless,
which suggests that for some preverb-root combinations at least there
might be a reluctance to drop the preverb, and in general one has the
impression that preverbless Masdars are less common, unless they have
been grammaticalised to function as a kind of abstract noun. Indeed, even
preverbal Masdars may function in this way too (consider variations on the
root-Thematic Suffix stem -c-em- for the verb 'give' such as: mi-c-em-a
'giving' => a-g-eb=mi-c-em-a 'commerce, trade (lit. taking up=giving)',
gada-c-em-a 'handing over; broadcast', g a - m o - c - e m - a 'publishing;
424                            GEORGIANGRAMMARpublication', da-c-em-a 'falling down; decline'). Is it accidental that two
of the formants for abstract nouns inGEORGIAN,namely -eba and -oba,
are also found (albeit analysed as -eb-a/-ob-a) in the Masdars of verbs
in -eb and -ob respectively? These formants are also frequently found
building abstract nouns from the Past Participle (e.g. (5a-c-m-ul-oba
'dress', g a - m o - s a x - u l - e b a = g a - m o - x a t ' - u l - e b a 'expression,
reprešentation', cvl-il-eba 'change'). As examples of preverbless vs

"    A subtle interplay between affixal marking and preverb sometimes
becomes relevant in such cases. In the non-Prešent Sub-Series the verb
'entrust' can take either mo- or mi-, the former when the verbal activity is
directed towards either 1st or 2nd person (or, more rarely, a 3rd person if
that 3rd person is in the vicinity of either speaker or addressee), whilst the
latter implies an action aimed away from speaker or addressee. This
means that, when prešented with a form like mimabareben, the listener
knows that the 1st person agreement-affix cannot be signalling an indirect
object, as motion towards 1st person would necessitate the preverb mo-.
Hence, this verb-form will be analysed as mi-m-(Ø-)a-bar-eb-en 'they
will entrust me to X/them', making the periphrasis unnecessary. On the
other hand, momabareben can only be analysed as mo-(Ø-)m-a-bar-
eb-en 'they will entrust X/them to me'.
    The esšentials of cross-referencing within the verb of upto three
external arguments have now been explained. More will be said at the
appropriate places about the specifics of Series 111 forms for Transitive
and Medial verbs and of Indirect verbs in general. This section closes
with some further examples of agreement-patterns for different types of
Transitive and Intransitive verb-forms in Series I and II—try to spot just
the relevant affixes, ignoring other features like preverb, Version-vowel,
or Thematic Suffix that may be prešent:

commentators as Prešent(-Future) Stem Formants or Series Markers, are
elements, consisting in all cases but one of the structure VC, which attach
directly to a root (or root + Causative-marker, or root + passive/inceptive
marker -d-) for all screeves in Series I. Since the Perfect of Transitives
is formed on the Prešent stem, most Transitives keep their Thematic Suffix
also in the Perfect. The verbal noun (Masdar) and participles for most
verbs also incorporate the relevant Thematic Suffix (in some cases in a
reduced guise), and, since Series III for monopersonal Intransitives is
formed from the Past Participle whilst that for bipersonal Intransitives is
formed from the Masdar, Thematic Suffixes are widely attested in Series
III for Intransitive (including Indirect and Stative) verbs. Two of the
Thematic Suffixes (with exceptions) even occur in Series 11. For these
reasons I judge the alternative names given above for these formants too
restrictive.
    The Thematic Suffixes in use today with Transitive Verbs are: -eb,
-ob, -av, -am, -ev, -en, and -i. Those in this list are widely used; in
addition one can point to: (a) -em, found in parts of the paradigm for the
root 'give' (viz. Future mi-(0-0-)s-c-em PREV-(you-3rd.PER-)3rd.PER-
give-TS(FUT) 'you will give X/them to Y/them' vs the equivalent Aorist mi-
(Ø-Ø-Ø-)e-c-i PREV-(you-3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)IOV-give-AORJNDIC                 'you
gave X/them to Y/them'); (b) -op, found with the root for 'divide' (viz. ga-
(Ø-Ø-)q'-op PREV-(you-3rd.PER-)divide-TS(FUT) 'you will divide X/them'
vs Aorist ga-(Ø-Ø-)q'av-i 'you divided X/them')—this suffix also turns up
in part of the paradigm of the copula (e.g. the past participle q'-op-il-i
'having been, ex-' and the masdar q'-op-n-a 'being').
    Whilst theGEORGIANmasdar does not normally distinguish active
(transitive) from passive (intransitive), there are a number of roots which
do possess their own passive/intransitive masdars. In these masdars one
finds the element -om occupying the slot normally taken by the Thematic
Suffix (i.e. between root and masdar-exponent -a). Consider the following:
(a-)(Ø-)dg-eb-i 'you (will) stand up' => vs a-dg-om-a 'standing up' (cf.
dg-om-a 'standing'), (mo-)(Ø-)k'vd-eb-i 'you (will) die' => (mo-)k'vd-om-
a 'dying'18, (Ø-)xt'-i 'you jump' => xt'-om-a 'jumping', (ga-)t'q'd-eb-a 'X
(will) break(s)' => (ga-)t'q'd-om-a 'breaking (intrans.)' vs (ga-)(0-0-)t'ex
'you (will) break X/them' => (ga-)t'ex-a 'breaking (trans.)', (mo-)(0-0-)a-
xd-en 'you (will) effect X/them' => (mo-)xd-en-a 'effecting' vs (mo-)xd-
eb-a 'it (will) happen(s)' => (mo-)xd-om-a 'happening'. With this last it is
interesting to compare the verb-form ( g a - ) ( 0 - 0 - 0 - ) x d - i (N.B. the
144                          GEORGIANGRAMMARdifferent Thematic Suffix as well as the structural analysis) (Prev-)(you-
3rd.PER-3rd.PER-)strip-TS 'you (will) remove article(s) of clothing X from
Y/them', for which the masdar is (ga-)xd-a 'undressing', whereas we have
the intransitive form (ga-)(Ø-)xd-eb-i 'you (will) become X; you (will)
grow thin', for which the masdar is (ga-)xd-om-a. However, for the
former meaning of this verb-form there exists the transitive (ga-)(0-
0 - ) x d - i 'you (will) render X/them Y' (e.g. u+en+o-s     ga-g-xd-i-s
speechless-DAT PREV-you-render-X(FUT) 'X will render you speechless').
Yet it would seem that in this instance the Masdar in -om is also used
transitively—KEGl quotes this example for C'avč'avadze:      še+i+jl+eb+a st'umar-i jm-ad                mi-(Ø-)i-tvis-o-s

      'It's possible for a man to accept a guest as a brother, but, as for
      making him (his) master, he will die and (still) not deign to do this'     In the case of šr-om-a the word is viewed today more as an abstract-
noun 'work(ing)' than as the Masdar of (Ø-Ø-)š'vr-eb-i 'you do X'.
     There are a few verbs that employ in places the seeming Thematic
Suffix -ol (e.g. kar-i kr-i-s 'the wind blows' => kr-ol-a 'blowing' and cf.
the Future kar-i i-kr-ol-eb-s 'the wind will blow'; g-q'+av-s 'you have
animate X/them' => q'-ol-a 'having (something animate)' and cf. the Future
g-e-q'-ol-eb-a 'you will have animate X/them'; (Ø-Ø-)i-svr-i 'you hurl
X/them' => sr-ol-a 'throwing' and cf. the Future (Ø-Ø-)i-sr-ol-eb 'you
will hurl X/them'; (da-)(Ø-)c'v-eb-i 'you (will) lie down' => da-c'-ol-a
'lying down' (cf. c'-ol-a 'lying')).
     Another suffix that might be regarded as (at least akin to) a Thematic
Suffix is -il, but this too today has more of the force of an abstract-noun
formant—it is particularly common with Stative verbs, and sometimes it
combines with the prefix si- (e.g. tav-i g-t'k'iv-a head-NOM you-pain-it
'your head aches' => t'k'iv-il-i '(being in) pain', (Ø-)dum-x-a+r you-
be.silent-you-be 'you are silent' => dum-il-i '(being in) silence', (Ø-)k'vd-
eb-i 'you die' => si-k'vd-il-i 'death', (Ø-)i-rb-en 'you will run' => either
si-rb-il-i or rb-en-a 1 9 , g-ši-a 'you are hungry' => ši-mš-il-i <= *si-ms-
il-i, for the bilabial nasal cf. mš-ier-i 'hungry' and (Ø-Ø-)a-mš-ev 'you
                             VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                            145make X/them hungry'). In a few verbs the suffix -il seems to correlate
with -in in other parts of the paradigm (e.g. j(-)il-i 'sleep' vs g-j(-)in-
av-s 'you are asleep', korc'(-)il-i 'wedding-feast' vs da-korc'(-)in-d-
nen 'they got married' and gan-korc'(-)in-d-nen 'they got divorced').
     The Thematic Suffix -i is clearly the exception in terms of its
structure, as well as being the one which is not carried over into the
Perfect. However, at first glance it may seem that this latter statement is
not correct (cf. ga-g-zrd-i-s PREV-you-rear-TS-X          'X will rear you',
which gives the Perfect ga-(Ø-)u-zrd-i-x-a+r 'X apparently (has) reared
you', where we still have an i-vowel immediately after the root. However,
this is no longer the Thematic Suffix but a Perfect-exponent, as we see if
we take any Transitive Perfect formed from roots coupled either with no
Thematic Suffix or any Thematic Suffix other than -av or -am in Series I
(e.g. for the Root Verb (da-)(0-0-)c'er 'you (will) write X/them' we have
the Perfect da-g-i-c'er-i-a 'you apparently wrote/have written X/them',
whilst for (ga-)(0-0-)a-k'et-eb 'you (will) do/make X/them' we have the
Perfect ga-g-i-k'et-eb-i-a 'you apparently (have) made X/them').
     Of the Thematic Suffixes listed above -eb, or, more restrictedly, -ob
and -ev are also found in Series I screeves as part of the morphology of
Intransitive verbs—as indeed is the bilabial element of -am and the labio­
dental for some verbs in -av.
     As to the original function of the Thematic Suffixes, the best
explanation so far advanced is that of Aronson (1979). To anticipate what
is made explicit in Chapter 5, a comparison of the syntax of Transitive and
Intransitive verbal classes for Series I screeves reveals that we are
dealing with a Nominative-Accusative configuration (the Nominative case
marks the subject of both Transitive and Intransitive Verbs, whilst the
direct object is marked differently, viz. by the Dative case). In Series II,
however, we have an Ergative-Absolutive alignment (transitive subjects
standing in the Ergative case, whilst intransitive subjects and direct objects
stand in the Nominative(-Absolutive)). The Dative case is, of course, also
used to mark the indirect object with the majority of finite verb-forms, and
the at first glance surprising fact that the Dative also marks the direct
object for Transitive Verbs in Series I screeves could be straightforwardly
explained, if in origin the relevant argument functioned as an indirect
object of what at the time would have been a bivalent intransitive verb-
form. Aronson illustrated an instance in OldGEORGIANwhere what today
would be regarded as a simple Dative direct object was evidently
interpreted as an indirect object thereby occasioning the Set B agreement-
prefix s- in the verb-form (namely:
146                         GEORGI AN GRAMMAR      s-cv-i-d-es                            i+gi-n-i       bč'e-ta
      3rd.PER-defend-3rd.PER-I MPERF-they    that-Pl-NOM    gate-Pl(DAT)
      'they were defending the gates')    Taking, as commentators generally do, Series 11 with its ergative-
alignment to be basic in the language, Aronson suggested that what today
are clearly independently existing Series I transitive screeves with their
own restructured tense, and aspectual (sc. imperfective vs perfective)
oppositions (not to mention the active-passive dichotomy) were in origin all
derived intransitive, imperfective forms produced from the fundamental,
ergatively aligned Series 11 base-forms by an anti-passive transformation,
whose morphological markers were none other than today's Thematic
Suffixes. Series I direct objects were, thus, in origin indirect objects and
were naturally marked by the Dative; this case has simply continued to
mark the relevant entity, now reinterpreted as a direct object.
    A given root will normally be used for a given meaning always with the
same Thematic Suffix, even though it sometimes happens that dialects
employ for a given root a Thematic Suffix different from the one generally
in use, and Root Verbs are sometimes assigned a Thematic Suffix, often
-av (e.g. for (Ø-Ø-)t'ex 'you break X/them' one may meet (Ø-Ø-)t'ex-
av). However, we have already given one example where the suffix -av
was replaced by -eb when an indirect object governed by the locative
Versional vowel a- was associated with the root in question. Two parallel
examples would be (še-)(0-0-)k'er-av (PREV-)(you-3rd.PER-)sew-TS 'you

148                        GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.3 Preverbs       (zmn+is+c'in+eb+i)In origin the preverbs were independently standing adverbial elements
which indicated directionality and/or orientation (sc. movement towards or
away from the speaker). Comparison of a case like postposition -gan 'from'
vs preverb ga(n)- 'out of' reveals a clear bifurcation in the development of
one such hypothesised adverbial as it solidified in the former instance with
a noun and in the latter instance with a verb (cf. postposition -Si 'in(to)' and
preverb še- 'in(to)'). Further evidence for the original independent status
of these elements comes both from the frequent examples of so-called
tmesis in OldGEORGIANtexts and from the behaviour of some of the
preverbs in modern Svan.
    The original directional-orientational force of the preverbs is
preserved when they are combined with roots expressing motion. Starting
with the two preverbs of orientation, mi- and mo-, the prešent-day list of
preverbs is as follows:      Simplex                                       Complex
      mi-                 thither                   mi-mo-

      ga(n)-              out                       ga-mo-

      da-                 down                      [da-mo-]    N.B. the older alternative forms with bracketed material are not in free
variation with their shorter variants, and their use will be described
separately below.
    We can start by illustrating their usage in association with the basic
root of motion for the Prešent Indicative—for the conjugation of this verb
see 4.10. The forms below are given with 3rd person singular subject:      mi-di-s                  X is going
      mi-mo-di-s               X is coming & going
      mo-di-s                  X is coming
      a-di-s                   X is going up
      a-mo-di-s                X is coming up
      g a-di-s                 X is going out
                            VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                            149   ga-mo-di-s                 X is coming out
   gada-di-s                  X is going over/across/through
   gad-mo-di-s                X is coming over/across/through
   še-di-s                    X is going in
   še-mo-di-s                 X is coming in
   ča-di-s                    X is going down (into)
   ča-mo-di-s                 X is coming down (into)
   da-di-s                    X goes regularly; X goes down    Today mi- indicates 'thither', which is interpreted as orientation away
from either speaker or hearer (hence the translation 'go'), whereas m o -
indicates 'hither', which is orientation towards either speaker or hearer (or
towards a 3rd person who is in the vicinity of speaker or hearer—hence
'come'). In OldGEORGIANmo- was associated exclusively with the speaker,
so that, whereas today one can only say šen-tan mo-di-s 'X is coming to
your place', the equivalent in OldGEORGIANwould have been šen-tan mi-
di-s. Where a verbal root implies movement, if that root has as its
preverb mi- when the movement is towards a 3rd person indirect object,
then the preverbal slot will be taken by mo- for movement towards 1st or
2nd person (e.g. mi-v-(Ø-Ø-)e-c-i 'I gave X/them to Y/them' vs m o -
(Ø-)g-e-c-i = OldGEORGIANmi-(Ø-)g-e-c-i 'I gave X/them to you' vs
mo-(Ø-Ø-)gv-e-c-i 'you gave X/them to us'; mi-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)mart-e 'you
addressed yourself to X/them' vs mo-(?Ø-)g-mart-es 'they addressed
themselves to you/you(PD' vs mo-(Ø-?Ø-)m-mart-e-t 'you(Pl) addressed
yourselves to me'2Ø).
    Association of the two orientational preverbs in the order given
indicates movement in both directions (i.e. 'to and fro', 'back and forth').
An example would be mi-mo-di-s tav+is otax-ši 'X is pacing back and
forth/up and down in his/her own room'. Such a coupling can often be
alternatively expressed by a special reduplication consisting of m i - plus
relevant components of the verbal complex upto (usually) the end of the
root followed by (and hyphenated if written) the same sequence but with
mo- plus all appropriate inflexional material after the root (e.g. mi-mo-i-
xed-av-s = mi-i-xed=mo-i-xed-av-s 'X will look this way and that' 21 ;
and mi-mo-(Ø-)a-c , q'd-eb-a = mi-(Ø-)a-c , q'd=mo-(Ø-)a-c'q'd-eb-a
'X will crash into Y this way and that'). However, to judge by the relatively
few examples quoted in KEGl, in the case of the basic verb of motion
reduplication with these two orientational preverbs may imply movement
over a greater distance than is achievable in a single room, e.g.

      'men (and) women are coming and going to (sc. and from) the vineyard'    This type of reduplication is not of course limited to the two preverbs
illustrated so far—for example, the normal preverb for the root - c ' o n -
'weigh' is a-, but to indicate a very serious consideration of a matter we
can combine this with da-, whose original directional force was the
opposite to that of a-, to give:      a-(Ø-)c'on=da-(Ø-)c'on-es
      PREV-(3rd.PER-)weigh-PREV-(3rd.PER-)weigh-they(AOR)
      'they weighed X/them up and down'    Coupling of m o - with itself would be illogical, as one cannot have
hither-orientation of 'hither', but for the other preverbs abšence of m i -
implies thither-orientation, whilst the addition of mo- as second component
lends the basic directionality a hither-orientation, which explains the
translations appended to the examples listed above.
    The original force of da- was 'down', and this is still prešent in such
verbs as da-(?0-)e-c-a or da-vard-a 'X fell down'. However, with the
verb of motion the meaning 'go down' is rather restricted, KEGl giving just
the one example for the subject 'temperature', viz.      t'emp'erat'ura     gam-it     zog-jer       nul-a-mde       da-di-s
      temperature(NOM) night-INST some-times null-ADV-upto        PREV-fall-X
      'sometimes by night the temperature falls/sinks to zero'    With this šense the verb has the regular paradigm for the verb of
motion (viz. 3rd person Future da-va 2 3 , Aorist da-vid-a, Perfect d a - s -
ul-a). However, da-di-s more usually has the šense of 'go on a regular
basis', which contrasts with mi-di-s 'X goes/is going NOW' and m i - m o -
di-s 'X is going to and fro NOW' (e.g. sk'ola-ši da-di-s velosip'ed-it 'X

   'boats (regularly) journey between Poti and Odessa')    For this šense the verb resorts to (transitive but preverbless!)
suppletive forms outside the Prešent Sub-Series (viz. 3rd person Future
(i+s) i-vl-i-s, Aorist (man) i-a+r-a, Perfect (ma-s)            u-vl-i-a,
Pluperfect (ma-s) e-vl-o—see 4.10).
    For the coupling da-mo- Shanidze (1976.71) quotes an OldGEORGIAN
example from Acts (possibly 9:39) where the šense is 'down hither', viz.   da-mo-s-di-od-es                                nak'adul-n-i

   tear-Pl.GEN-Pl-NOM
   'streams of tears were pouring down them'but in ModernGEORGIANthe coupling is found with only one verb root, and
even here it is restricted to the relevant Past and Privative Participles (viz.
da-mo-k'id-eb-ul-i 'dependent', da-mo-u-k'id-eb-el-i 'independent')
and their derivatives (viz. da-mo-k'id-eb-ul-eba 'dependence', da-mo-
u-k'id-eb-1-oba 'independence').
    For the šense of 'X is going down' ča-di-s is used (e.g lipt'-it a-di-
x-a+r tu ča-di-x-a+r? 'Are you going up or down with the lift?'), in
addition to retaining its original force of 'down into' (e.g. magaro-ši ča-v-
di-v-a+r 'I'm going down (into) the mine'), which is explained by the
preverb's etymology (c'a- <= š-ta- <= *še-da-). The intermediate stage in
the development is retained in such forms as š+ta+gon+eb+a 'inspiration',
whereas the Masdar of this cognate verb today is ča-gon-eb-a 'putting a
thought in someone's mind'. This preverb is also used with the verb of
motion to signify 'alight from a car/train/bus' (e.g. ča-v-di-v-a+r, ga-
(Ø-)m-a-t'ar-e! 'I'm getting off, let me pass/off/through!') or 'go
somewhere (covering a large distance, as between two towns)'.               If
orientation is towards speaker or addressee in these cases, the complex
da-mo- will naturally be used (e.g. dge-s vin ča-mo-di-s mosk'ov-
i+dan? 'Who is coming from Moscow today?').
    In addition to being used for the direction 'into from outside', the
preverb še- is used in contexts of signifying 'up onto' (e.g. da-jd-a 'X sat
down' with da- vs še-jd-a cxen-ze/xe-ze 'X sat on the horse/tree' with
še-).
152                        GEORGIANGRAMMAR    On p. 17 of S. Mak'alatia's History and Ethnography of Mingrelia we find
in virtually identical contexts the Past Participle meaning 'preserved', and
yet in one case še- alone is used, whilst in the other we have še-mo-, viz.     mcire      cn+ob-eb-i-a       jvel berjn+ul m+c'er+l+oba-ši

     'few reports are preserved in Ancient Greek literature'vs berjn+ul c'q'aro-eb-ši mcire cn+ob-eb-i-a še+mo+nax+ul-i 'in

    No example was offered above for the preverbs c ' a - / c ' a - m o - , c'a-
basically indicating 'forward' (cf. c'in 'in front, before, ahead'), in the
Prešent of the verb of motion. This is because such couplings are not
possible in the Prešent Sub-Series. However, elsewhere in the paradigm
these preverbs do come into play, and the question arises as to how one
differentiates between, say, the Futures c'a-va and rni-va, both signifying
'X will go'. The answer is that c'a- emphasises the departure and
journeying, whilst mi- implies reaching the destination (e.g. bič'-i c'a-va
sk'ola-ši 'the lad will go to school' vs bič'-i mi-va buxar-tan 'the lad
will go upto the stove'). The same interplay is observed with the verb for
'take'—in the Prešent Sub-Series only mi- is possible, e.g.      eg c'ign-i       sad      mi-g-a-kv-s?
      that book-NOM where? PREV-you-lV-take-it
      'Where are you taking that book?'whereas elsewhere the same nuances as just described attach to the
preverbs mi- and c'a-, e.g.      malamo          tan    c'a-(Ø-Ø-)-t'an-e! (= c'a-(Ø-Ø-)i-g-e!)

      'the teacher took the book to the class'
      The difference between mo- and c'a-mo- is that the former indicates

'away' towards or with speaker or hearer (e.g. mo-(Ø-)di a+k! 'come

   'Hold on, we'll come along too')    From their original role as markers of directionality/orientation the
preverbs took on the function of marking perfective aspect with the result
that today for the bulk of verbs in the Transitive and Intransitive classes
the relevant preverb will usually be prešent in screeves other than those
of the Prešent Sub-Series. The addition of the appropriate (and usually
unpredictable) preverb to the Prešent Indicative of most Transitive or
Intransitive verbs produces the Future Indicative (e.g. (Ø-)a-k'et-eb-s
'X does/makes Y/them' => ga-(Ø-)a-k'et-eb-s 'X will do/make Y/them').
 In OldGEORGIANthere was no independent Future Indicative screeve, the
Prešent or Aorist Subjunctive as appropriate (sc. according to aspect)
making up the deficiency. The association of root with preverb can then
come to play a lexical role, for by altering the preverb from ga- to še-
with the root -k'et- we produce a verb-form with the lexical meaning
'repair' (e.g. ro+di+s še-(Ø-)a-k'et-eb-en a+m t'elevizor-s? 'When
will they repair this television?'), the preverbless Prešent (Sub-Series) forms
being ambiguous out of context for the meanings 'do/make' vs 'repair'.
Another example would be the verb 'kill' which normally takes the preverb
m o - (e.g. bič'-ma baq'aq'-i mo-(Ø-)k'l-a 'the lad killed the frog'), but if
the killing is with a knife (typically of an animal slaughtered in ritualistic
sacrifice or for preparation as food), then the preverb da- takes over, e.g.   dia+saxl+is-ma katam-i              da-(Ø-)k'l-a               da
   housewife-ERG        chicken-NOM PREV-(it-)kill-she(AOR) and

   (it-)us-lV-feed-she(AOR)
   'the housewife killed the chicken (sc. by slitting its throat) and fed it to
   us'    These couplings do not exhaust the possibilities for the root 'kill', and
the range of couplings well illustrates the way the inter-dependencies of
root and preverb (as well as Version) complicate the lexical structure of

The reason for the choice of preverb in most of the examples in the
previous paragraph is, I think, opaque—synonymous roots can be found
which, despite their parallel semantics, take different preverbs (e.g. da-s-
cin-eb = ga-kird-av 'you will mock X'). Sometimes, the change can be
explained in terms of the original directional force of the preverb and the

This screeve of the indicative mood (txr+ob+it-i k'ilo), which is used as
equivalent to English 'X VERBs' or 'X is VERBing' and sometimes 'X is going
to VERB', is formed by adding the appropriate agreement-affixes to a base
consisting of Version Vowel (which will be zero for some verbs in Neutral
Version) plus Root plus Thematic Suffix (sc. other than in the case of Root
Verbs). The 3rd person singular subject-marker is universally -s, which
changes to -en in the plural, except for verbs with Thematic Suffix -i,
which require 3rd person plural subjects to be marked by the allomorph
-an. Basic paradigms are set out according to the so-called 'subject-
conjugation', which means that the direct object is kept constant in the 3rd

"Verbs
Structurally aGEORGIANverb may incorporate such elements (morphemes)
as the following:(1) Preverb(s) - (2) Agreement Prefix - (3) Version Vowel - (4) ROOT - (5)
Causative Suffix(es) - (6) Passive Formant [-d-j - (7) Thematic Suffix - (8)
Perfect/Stative Marker - (9) Past Marker [-(o)d-j - (1Ø) Tense/Mood Vowel
- (11) Agreement Suffix/Pluraliser     Preverbs originally indicated direction, a function they retain with
verbs of motion, but today they largely serve to denote perfective aspect
(i.e. the carrying of a verbal activity through to its conclusion) and tend to
occur everywhere outside the Prešent Sub-Series (viz. Prešent Indicative,
Imperfect Indicative, Prešent Subjunctive) with Transitive and Intransitive
verbs.
     Verbs can agree not only with their subject (as is the norm for the
Indo-European language-family) but with both direct and indirect objects.
Agreement is achieved by means of items (2) and (11) from the above-list.
There are two sets of agreement-affixes.           The so-called 'subject'-
agreement affixes:                               SINGulAR                PluRAl

sets are used and combined in any given verb-form, and there is no short­
cut available to learning the facts. However, as regards the correlation
between affixal group and cašmarking, three patterns exist, as depicted
in the following table, where the 'subject'-affixes are symbolised as
subscript 'A' and the 'object'-affixes by subscript 'B':Cašmarking     Patterns & Verb-agreement

Series I (incorporating Prešent Indicative, Imperfect Indicative, Prešent
Subjunctive, Future Indicative, Future Subjunctive, Conditional), Series II
(incorporating Aorist Indicative, Aorist Subjunctive), Series III
(incorporating Perfect, Pluperfect, IIIrd Subjunctive). Verbs are also
classified in terms of Transitives, Intransitives, Medials, and Indirect Verbs
(plus the marginal Statives). This enables us to tabulate the distribution of
the above three patterns for these four/five verb-types as follows-.","[545, 546]"
"Thematic Suffix -eb
The Thematic Suffix is retained, to which is suffixed -in-, as in: (ga-)(Ø-
Ø-)a-k'et-eb 'you (will) do/make X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-k'et-eb-in-
eb 'you (will) get X/them to do/make Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-šv-eb
'you (will) release X/them' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-šv-eb-in-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to release Y/them'; (ga-)(Ø-Ø-)i-g-eb 'you (will) learn/understand
something' => (ga-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-g-eb-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to
learn/understand something'; (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-c , q , -eb 'you (will) begin
X/them' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-c'q'-eb-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to begin
Y/them'; N.B. (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-vic , q , -eb 'you (will) put X/them out of your
mind' => (da-i-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-vic'q'-eb(-in-eb) 'you (will) get X/them to
forget Y/them'; N.B. (da-)(Ø-Ø-)i-ma+xs+ov+r-eb 'you (will) recall
X/them to mind' => (da-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-ma+xs+ov+r-eb 'you (will) get
X/them to recall Y/them to mind'.
    The verb for 'locating' (viz. (mi-/mo-)(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)a-gn-eb 'you (will)
locate X/them') is a verb with Thematic Suffix -eb but (prescriptively at
least) with the peculiarity that it is construed with a subject and indirect
object of the entity located. We have seen, however, that there are
examples where the construction is regularised to conform with that of a
normal Transitive Verb with subject and direct object of the entity located.
Morphologically the Causative is entirely regular, producing (mi-/mo-)(Ø-
Ø-Ø-)a-gn-eb-in-eb 'you (will) get X/them to locate Y/them'. However,
syntactically this Causative seems to behave as though its b a š v e r b were
just like any normal Transitive Verb (ignoring, in other words, the
prescriptive construction for the bašverb)—for the syntax of Causatives
see 5.1.8. Consider the strange example in KEGl from the 19th century
writer C'avč'avadze: zog+ad mizez-s mi-(?Ø-?Ø-)gv-a-gn-eb-in-a
i+m gare+mo+eba-m 'that circumstance permitted us to find the general

By the term 'potential' I mean clauses dependent upon introductory
expressions like 'must, ought, should, want, advise, try, be able, necessary,
possible, preferable, e t c . ' . If a finite reprešentation is required, then
where the proposition relates to the future, the Aorist SUBJunctive is used;
where it relates to the prešent, the Prešent SUBJunctive is used; where it
relates to the past, the Pluperfect is used. The complementiser rom is
optional. The Masdar serves as the non-finite reprešentation in such
expressions.
    The 3rd person Prešent of the verb 'want' (u-nd-a) has been
grammaticalised as the invariant particle of obligation. Prescriptively,
nothing can stand between it and its dependent finite verb—in other words,
rom is never used in this expression, e.g.      male u+nd+a            c'a-[v-jvid-e
      soon it.is.necessary   PREV-[I-jgo-AOR.SUBJ
      'I must go soon'   Should u-nd-a be functioning as the 3rd person Prešent of 'wish', then
rom is optional and other material too may separate main from subordinate
verb, e.g.      masp'injel-s (Ø-)u-nd-a,           (rom) male c'a-[v-jvid-e
      host-DAT      (he-)OV-want-it      that soon PREV-[I-]go-AOR.SUBJ
      The host wants me to go soon'    If the SUBJects of the introductory and subordinate verbs are co-
referential, then Equi-NP-Del may apply to produce the Masdar in place of
the Aorist SUBJunctive, e.g.      masp'injel-s (Ø-)u-nd-a (a)        (rom) da-)d-e-s / /

formally as an Intransitive, albeit in conjunction with a nominal

(e.g. (Ø-Ø-)e-p'at'iž-e = da-(Ø-Ø-)p'at'iž-e 'you invited X/them', though
the syntactic configuration in Series 11 is different, the former verb-form
taking a Nominative subject and Dative object, the latter an Ergative
subject and Nominative object).

marking of the verb's Dative subject in the Pluperfect and 111 rd
Subjunctive of Transitive and Medial Verbs see 4.7.1.3 and 4.7.3. Apart
from the e-versioniser's role as part-marker of subjects for Transitive and
Medial Verbs in the Pluperfect and III rd Subjunctive, it is surprisingly
found with two related roots in their transitive Series I and 11 screeves,
and this despite the fact that their second argument is a direct rather than
indirect object (viz. (Ø-Ø-)e-j+eb 'you (will) seek X/them': (Ø-Ø-)e-j+
eb-e 'you sought X/them': g-i-j+eb-n-i-a 'you have apparently sought
X/them' vs (Ø-Ø-)e-ji-eb 'you (will) seek X/them': (Ø-Ø-)e-ji-e 'you

214                           GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.5 Root
A verbal root does not necessarily always retain the same shape
throughout its paradigm. The changes will be indicated in the description
of screeve-formations. In addition to such changes, root-suppletion is also
attested. Wholesale alteration of the root may be a function of: (a) the
opposition singular:plural for an Intransitive Verb's subject (e.g. zi-s 'X is
seated' vs sxed-an 'they are seated') or for a Transitive Verb's direct
object, e.g.      magida-s-tan st'umar-s            v-(Ø-)sv-am
      table-DAT-at       guest-DAT      I -(him-)seat-TS
      'I seat the guest at the table'vs st'umr-eb-s v-(Ø-)a-sx-am 'I seat the guests'; (b) the opposition
animate:inanimate for the (logical) direct object, e.g.      c'ign-i      m-a-kv-s / / c'ign-s        mo-v-(Ø-)i-t'an
      book-NOM I-lV-have-it        book-DAT PREV-(it-)SV-bring(FUT)
      'I have a/the book//shall bring a/the book'vs
      da            m-q'+av-s / / da-s              mo-v-(Ø-)i-q'van
      sister(NOM) I-have-her          sister-DAT    PREV-I -(her-)SV-bring(FUT)
      'I have a sister//shall bring (my) sister'(c) change of screeve-(sub-)series.        The simplest cases of this last
phenomenon are those when one root stands in the Prešent Sub-Series and
another elsewhere (e.g. (Ø-Ø-)xed-av (you-3rd.PER-)see-TS 'you see
X/them' vs (Ø-Ø-)nax-av 'you will see X/them' vs (Ø-Ø-)nax-e 'you saw
X/them'). Sometimes three different roots will be used for the Prešent Sub-
Series, the Future Sub-Series and Series 11/111 respectively (as in the case
of (Ø-Ø-)amb-ob 'you say (X/them)' vs (Ø-Ø-)i-t'q'v-i 'you will say
(X/them)' vs (Ø-Ø-)tkv-i//g-i-tkv-am-s 'you said//have said (X/them)').
Not only may such changes affect the root but the active-passive
(transitive-intransitive) structure of the verb-form as a whole may change
too (e.g. the formally 'passive-intransitive' (Ø-Ø-)švr-eb-i 'you do X/them'
vs active-transitive (Ø-Ø-)i-zam 'you will do X/them' vs active-transitive
(Ø-Ø-)ken-i//g-i-kn-i-a      'you did//have done X/them').

appears only in the complex morph -ev-in-. However, the existence of
old forms like (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-s-m-ev 'you give X to Y to drink' (cf. (Ø-Ø-)sv-
am 'you drink X/them') and (Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-č'm-ev 'you feed X to Y' (cf. ( 0 -
0-)č'am 'you (will) eat X/them') not only means that there is no unique
marker of causation inGEORGIANbut suggests that the marking of causation
must somehow at one time have been one of the functions of (at least some
of) the Thematic Suffixes (-in being a variant of the Thematic Suffix -en).
In Svan the most common Causative marker is, indeed, -un-, and the
prešence of an element -un- in a few marginal cases inGEORGIANperhaps
suggests the one-time existence of such a Causative marker here too.","[230, 231, 232, 233, 234]"
"1.4 The Development of the Georgian Literary LanguageThe natural dynamics of language-change have rendered Modern Georgian
somewhat different from its earliest attested predecessor. Given the
existence of 15 centuries of material, the urge to periodise is strong, and
the standard divisions are: 5th-11th centuries for Old Georgian, 12th-18th
centuries for Mediaeval Georgian, 19th century for the start of Modern
Georgian. However, Sardzhveladze (1984.253-275) counsels caution over
too ready an acceptance of even the basic assumption that clearly defined
breaks can be imposed on what is rather a continuum. He points out that
the period commonly thought of as representing Old Georgian is not itself
linguistically uniform, so that recognition of a certain set of changes would
justify the establishment of at least the two sub-periods (a) 5th-8th and (b)
9th-11th centuries (ibid.269ff.). The problem thereafter is that the extant
texts begin to cover other areas than the purely ecclesiastical, such that
linguistic style is to a degree determined by subject-matter, with ancient
norms prevailing but starting to be rivalled by features from the spoken
language. The Church continued to regard the classical language as the
only appropriate medium for worship and literature, with the result that, as
time passed, the language was being written according to norms that were
becoming ever more out of date and less understood. The move to rid the
literary language of this artificiality and to re-invigorate it by aligning it
with the type of Georgian people actually spoke was part of the general
movement for Georgia's national revival in the latter half of the 19th
century—for the most recent account of this period see Suny (1989.113­
 MS; reprinted 1994). The most prominent supporter of modernisation was
the writer and political activist, Prince Ilia C'avc'avadze (1837-1907), who
is now universally regarded as the 'Father of the modern Georgian nation'
and who was canonised by the Georgian Church on the 150th anniversary
of his birth.",[27]
"4.7.1.2.1 Aorist Indicative (na+m+q'+o jir+it+ad-i = c'q'vet'+il-i)
This screeve is primarily used for simple actions in the past that are
viewed as momentary events, but the screeve also stands in real conditions
                             VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                              243as an alternative to the Future Indicative with reference to the future.
    For all Transitive Verbs (indeed for all verbs of any sort, other than (i)
the basic verb of motion and (ii) any verb which happens not to possess an
Aorist Indicative) the Imperative is identical with the 2nd person subject
forms of the Aorist Indicative. A few verbs may colloquially shorten their
Imperatives; all such cases will be indicated.
    There are two main types of conjugation differentiated according to
which suffixal vowel marks the Aorist Indicative (= Simple Past) when the
subject is either 1st or 2nd person: the Weak, in which the relevant
exponent is -e, and the Strong, in which the relevant exponent is - i —
occasionally for stylistic, archaising purposes one may find this latter
vowel omitted for some verbs when it stands in word-final position. A 3rd
person singular subject will select either -a or -o, whilst a 3rd person
plural subject is marked by the allomorph -es. In general, though not
universally, the Thematic Suffixes are abšent in Series II. Other changes
that affect the shape of the root will be indicated where appropriate.","[261, 262]"
"    With other roots the use of the Subjective Version when the verb has
no indirect object contrasts with the abšence of any versioniser in the
prešence of an indirect object. Examples: p'ur-s (Ø-Ø-)i-txov 'you will
ask for bread' vs mezobel-s p'ur-s (Ø-Ø-)s-txov 'you will ask the
neighbour for bread', p'olici+el-eb-ma                  mo-(?Ø-)i-xed-es 'the
policemen looked in this direction' vs p'olici+el-eb-ma hulign-eb-s
m o - ( ? Ø - ) g v - x e d - e s 'the policemen looked (in this direction) at us
hooligans', (Ø-Ø-)i-k'itx-e xalx-ši 'you enquired (sc. about something)
among the people' vs xalx-s (Ø-Ø-)h-k'itx-e 'you asked the people (sc.
about something)'. With the final opposition from the previous paragraph
compare the somewhat archaic expression seen in:

      'I shall not ask you to answer for that person's arrogance'    Note also what happens with the root -q'id- in the Future Sub-Series
and Series II: Subjective Versional saxl-s v-(Ø-)i-q'id-i 'I'll buy a/the
house' vs saxl-s mo-(Ø-)g-q'id-i 'I'll sell the house to you' or saxl-s
mi-(Ø-Ø-)h-q'id-i kal-s 'you will sell the house to the woman' (vs the
Neutral Versional saxl-s ga-v-(Ø-)q'id-i 'I'll sell the house').
    Since the Subjective Version does not always appear when one would
logically expect it, it is perhaps hardly surprising that one can adduce
examples where the locative Version wins out when either the Subjective
or the locative Version could logically be employed, e.g.      kal-ma        tav-i      da-(Ø-Ø-)a-k'l-a                 kmar-s

      'the clever one avoided the danger'
    No Subjective Version is possible when the root requires the indirect
object to be marked without versioniser, e.g.      gmir-ma       tav+is-i    si+cocxl+e      še-(Ø-)s-c'ir-a

      'the hero sacrificed his own life to his own country'    In a colloquial expression for 'gathering X together', the direct object
tav-i does not belong to the verb's subject and so would never motivate
the Subjective Version, e.g.      mo-v-(Ø-Ø-)u-q'ar-e                                    tav-i

      'the father hit the child with his hand'    It is also possible to point to an interplay between Objective Version
and lack of versioniser with some intransitive verb-forms. An indirect
object can be associated with the basic verb of motion. I n the Future Sub-
Series and in Series 11 this indirect object has to be indicated by the
                              VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                           201Objective Version—for mo-svl-a 'coming' this gives examples like ra mo-
g-i-va-t? 'what will come over you(Pl)?', ra mo-gv-i-vid-od-a? 'what
would come/would have come over us?', ra mo-(Ø-)u-vid-a-t? 'what
came over them?', etc... In the Prešent Sub-Series the lack of versioniser
seems more common, for this coupling of preverb and root at any rate (e.g.
ra mo-s-di-t? 'what comes over them?'). This verb-form can also mean
with either marking of the indirect object 'receive, gain, acquire', though in
the expression 'liquid flows from' (as in:      t'an-i+dan sisxl-i          mo-s-di-od-a
      body-from      blood-NOM PREV-X-flow-I MPERF-it
      'blood was flowing from X's body')it seems from KEGl's illustrations that the Objective Version is not used.
For the motion-root in association with other preverbs it will sometimes be
the case that in the Prešent Sub-Series some šense(s) may be conveyed by
either marking of the indirect object, whereas others may be particular to
one method or the other, e.g.      ra-d        (Ø-)t'ir-i?      ga-m-di-s    /       ga-m-i-di-s

"4.7.1 Transitive Class (garda+ma+val-i zmn-eb-is k'las-i)

with any external direct object (e.g. bavšv-ma mo-(?0-)šard-a 'the baby
urinated', mo+lar+e-m a-(?0-)i-xed-a 'the cashier looked up'). At some
stage in the history of the language these verbs will have been associated
with a direct object, which over time was dropped because of its
predictability; indeed, for the second verb illustrated above we have a
virtual synonym in OldGEORGIANshewing that the direct object will have
been 'eyes', thereby accounting for the prešence in the verb of the
Subjective Version (viz. John 17.1:      iesu        ag-(Ø-)i-xil-n-a                       tual-n-i

as äard-l//ps+el-i 'urine'. No finiteGEORGIANverb-form exists without
the prešence of at least a Set A agreement-affix. In Series III the agent
of Transitive Verbs stands in the Dative and is taken up in the verb-form
by a Set B affix. This leaves the remaining Set A affix clearly pointing to
the (notional and/or historical) prešence of the direct object now missing

"    See 5.1.13.2 below for a discussion of these oddities and a suggested
explanation.
    An opposite type of IIIogicality is where the morphology of an
Intransitive verb points to the prešence of a Dative indirect object, and
yet the second NP in the clause is governed by a postposition and thus
cannot be dependent on the verb. This syntactic monovalence is often
given morphological recognition in III rd Series' forms, which are mono-
personal rather than bi-personal in structure, e.g.   k'ač'k'ač'-i katm-eb-ši           ča-(Ø-)e-r-e-od-a             xolme

   The magpie would regularly mix in with the chickens'where the verb is clearly bipersonal morphologically, whilst in the following

   (Series III)   Some Transitive verbs have lost their original direct objects and are
thus construed with only one external NP (viz. the subject). Despite this,
55Ø                           GEORGIANGRAMMARthat subject requires the same c a š m a r k i n g and verb-agreement as a
'normal' transitive subject, e.g.     k'at'a-m     mo-(?Ø-)šard-a
     cat-ERGA PREV-(?itB-)urinate-itA(AOR)
     'the cat urinated'   From a single article in literary     Georgia (No.17, 1988, p. 15) we can
quote both:     p'asux-ma ar da-(?Ø-)a-q'ovn-a
     answer-ERG not PREV-(?3rd.PER-)NV-delay-it(AOR)
     'the answer was not long in coming'and the full transitive construction:     p'asux-i          ar    da-v-(Ø-)a-q'ovn-e
     answer-NOM        not PREV-I-(it-)NV-delay-I NDIC(AOR)
     'I did not delay the answer'    Other Transitive verbs, though having lost their original direct object,
are stIII bivalent by virtue of taking an indirect object; 'hit' falls into this
category, e.g.      m+c'vrtn+el-ma          lom-s        (?Ø-)s-cem-a
      trainer-ERGA           lion-DATB     (?itB-)itB-hit-heA(AOR)
      'the trainer hit the lion'    However, colloquially there is a tendency to normalise this verb by
treating the indirect object as the direct object and to c a š m a r k it
accordingly (viz. m+c'vrtn+el-ma lom-i (Ø-)?s-cem-a). A number of
what today are regular transitive verbs with subject and direct object were
in OldGEORGIANof the unregularised 'hit'-type (see Footnote 3 of Chapter
4).
    The Objective Version vowels serve to create indirect objects, cf.      m+xat'+v+ar-i       p'ort'ret'-s     (Ø-)xat'-av-s       sardl-is-tvis

incorporates the Objective Version in the first two screeve-Series, and yet
the entity which determines the person and shape of the object-agreement

"4.7.3.4 Preverbal Medials marking the moderate application of the verbal
activity
The addition of c'a- to basic Mediais in perfective screeves indicates that
the action is carried out to a small degree only. By my reckoning, KEGl
quotes circa 6Ø such verb-forms 98 . It prešents a further 5Ø or so verb-
forms where the preverb c'a-mo- is coupled to a basic Medial in the
perfective screeves; some of these are glossed in the same way as for
c'a-, namely 'X will VERB a little', but the majority seem to indicate a swift,
sudden (perhaps somewhat rude?) action on the part of the subject. For
c'a- we have examples like: c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-varjiš-eb 'you will take a bit
of exercise'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-gund-av-eb 'you will have a bit of a snowball
fight'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-vaxšm-eb 'you will have a light dinner'; c'a-(Ø-
?Ø-)i-zarmac-eb 'you will be a little lazy'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-tamaš-eb 'you
will play for a bit'; c'a/c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-lap'arak'-eb 'you will mutter to

me+cad+in-eb 'you will do a bit of studying'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-muSa-v-eb

(Ø-?Ø-)i-p'ur+maril-eb = c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-keip-eb 'you will have a bit of

xlič+in-eb 'you will utter something a bit hoarsely'; c'a-(Ø-?Ø-)i-xumr-
eb 'you will have a bit of a joke'.
     With indirect object we have formally prefixal bipersonal Intransitive
Verbs, such as: c'a-(Ø-Ø-)e-tamaš-eb-i 'you will play with X/them a
little' (Perfect c'a-(Ø-)s-tamaš-eb-i-x-a+r); c'a-g-e-mat'-eb-a 'a
little will be added to you' (Perfect c'a-g-mat'-eb-i-a); c'a-(Ø-Ø-)e-
xumr-eb-i 'you will joke a little with X/them' (Perfect c'a-(Ø-Ø-)xumr-
eb-i-x-a+r); c'a-(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i 'you will start talking to
X/them who are close to you'.
     One then finds such colloquialisms in the Prešent Sub-Series only as:
c'a-(?Ø-)i-boršč-eb-s 'it somewhat resembles borshch', c'a-(?Ø-)i-
k'oč'l-eb-s = mo-(?Ø-)i-k'oč""l-eb-s 'X limps a bit'; c'a-(?Ø-)i-
tav+xed-eb-s 'X is somewhat arrogant'.
     For c'a-mo- we have examples like: c'a-mo-(Ø-?Ø-)i-t'ir-eb 'you
will start to cry/have a little cry'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-bod-eb 'you will
mumble something incoherently in your sleep'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-gmin-eb
'you will suddenly moan something'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-zmu+vl-eb 'you will
suddenly howl something'; c'a-mo-(Ø-?Ø-)i-k'nav+l-eb 'you will suddenly
mew/utter mewingly'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-k'rut'+un-eb 'you will suddenly
utter something with a purr'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-t'ik't'ik'-eb 'you will
suddenly blurt something out'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-(p)s'mu+vl-eb 'you will
suddenly gasp something out'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'bed-eb = c'a-mo-(Ø-
Ø-)roš-av = c ' a - m o - ( Ø - Ø - ) a - q ' r a n t ' a l - e b 'you will suddenly
blurt/blabber something out'; c'a-mo-(?Ø-)i-kux-eb-s 'there will be a
sudden clap of thunder'; c'a-mo-(Ø-?Ø-)i-q'el + q'el-av-eb 'you will
suddenly push yourself forward'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-xrant'al-eb 'you will
splutter/stammer suddenly something'; c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-xrinc'+ial-eb
'you will suddenly utter something hoarsely'.
     When c'a-mo- replaces the normal preverbs (da-/mo-/mi-) for the
bipersonal prefixal Intransitive Verb 'help', we get c'a-mo-(Ø-Ø-)e-
xmar-eb-i 'you will give X/them a little help'.
     Without versioniser there is: c'a-mo-žinžgl-av-s 'there will be a little
light rain', but for 'raining' either a parallel form is possibe, viz. c'a-mo-
c'vim-s 'there will be a drop of rain', or both versioniser and Thematic
Suffix are used, as in c'a-mo-(?Ø-)i-c'vim-eb-s.
358                           GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.7.3.5 Medial Verbs with Indirect Object (Relative Medials)
Indirect objects with Medials are marked in a variety of ways.
     In some cases the Objective Version may be used in the expected way
to create an indirect object for the verb. For some verbs this is only
possible in the Prešent Sub-Series. Examples: sisxl-i g-i-dug-s 'your
blood is boiling'; mgel-s k'b+il-eb-i cecxl-i-vit                  (Ø-)u-el-av-s/(Ø-)u-
el+v+ar-eb-s 'the wolfs teeth flash like fire'; mtel-i sxeul-i m-i-špot-
av-s, m-i-trt-i-s = m-i-trt+ol-av-s = m-i-k'ank'al-eb-s = m - i -
caxcax-eb-s = m-i-)agjag-eb-s 'my whole body is roused, is shaking',
or with a different šense si+garib+e-s ar v-(Ø-)u-trt-i(-v-a+r) 'I do
not quake before poverty' (cf. jar-i ar (Ø-)u-prtx-i-s 99                 si+cx+e-s 'the
army is not afraid of the heat'). Where the Thematic Suffix is -eb in both
Prešent and Future Sub-Series, such forms in Objective Version may be
ambiguous between Prešent of the basic Medial and Future of the
(pseudo-)Causative. And so, if we take the Future of trt-i-s, we get
(?Ø-)i-trt+ol-eb, which gives the (pseudo-)Causative                   (Ø-)a-trt+ol-eb-s
'X makes (will make) Y/them tremble', which in Objective Version is (Ø-
Ø-)u-trt+ol-eb-s 'X (will) make Y/them tremble for Z/them', and this is
given in KEGl with the glosses                           (Ø-Ø-)u-caxcax-eb-s/(Ø-Ø-)u-
k'ank'al-eb-s (and we could add (Ø-Ø-)u-)agjag-eb-s)), even though
surprisingly these verb-forms under their own entries are only glossed in
KEGl itself as though they were restricted to functioning as synonyms of
(Ø-)u-trt-i-s.             However, for other verbs the Objective Version is
acceptable throughout Series I and 11 (e.g. (Ø-Ø-)u-q'vir-i/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-
q'vir-eb/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-q'vir-e/g-i-q'vir-(n-)i-?a m-is-tvis 'you shout/
will shout/ shouted/ have shouted at X';                   (Ø-Ø-)u-mger(-i)/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-
mger-eb/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-mger-e/g-i-mger-(n-)i-?a m-is-tvis 'you sing/
will sing/sang/have sung to X'; ga-(Ø-Ø-)u-rb-i-x-a+r/ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)
u-rb-en/ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-rb-in-e/ga-g-i-rb-en-i-a m-is-gan 'you
run/will run/ran/have run away from X').
     Sometimes the indirect object along with its agreement-prefix is simply
added to the basic Medial in the Prešent Sub-Series (e.g. (Ø-)p'asux-ob
'you give an answer' vs (Ø-)h-p'asux-ob 'you answer X/them' 1 Ø Ø ;
(Ø-)q'araul-ob = (Ø-)daraj-ob = q'araul-ada x-a+r 'you are on guard'
vs (Ø-)h-q'araul-ob = (Ø-)s-daraj-ob 'you guard X/them'). However, in
the Future Sub-Series and in Series 11 the Objective Version has to be
used when the indirect object is prešent (e.g. (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-p'asux-eb/(Ø-
?Ø-Ø-)u-p'asux-e 'you will answer/ answered X/them'; (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-
q'araul-eb/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-q'araul-e = (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-daraj-eb/(Ø-?Ø-
Ø-)u-daraj-e 'you will guard/guarded X/them'); (Ø-Ø-)h-k'arnax-
o b / ( Ø - Ø - Ø - ) u - k ' a r n a x - e b ) 'you (will) direct X/themI O in the
                             VERBAl MORPHOlOGY                              359writing/thinking of Y/themDO' behaves the same way. In Series III the
basic Medial formation is used and the underlying indirect object surfaces
as the postpositional object of - t v i s (e.g. sa+gare+o           sa+km+e-ta
minist'r-s (Ø-)u-p'asux-(n-)i-?a šen-tvis 'the Foreign Minister has
answered you').
      In the case of (Ø-Ø-)švel-i 'you aid X/them' (Imperfect (Ø-Ø-)švel-
od-i) the verb cannot be used without an indirect object, and although in
the Future Sub-Series and Series 11 the Objective Version is employed, the
usual Thematic Suffix -eb does not substitute for -i, giving the Future (Ø-
?Ø-Ø-)u-švel-i 'you will help X/them' (for which Vogt quotes the
Conditional (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-Svel-i-d-i)—N.B. 'help!' is (Ø-?Ø-)m-i-švel-el.
      For 'offer' the Future does substitute -eb but additionally takes the
preverb š ( m o - ) (viz. (Ø-Ø-)s-tavaz-ob 'you offer X/them to Y/them' =>
Future še-(mo-}(Ø-Ø-)s-tavaz-eb); in the Perfect this Thematic Suffix is
retained, giving še-(mo-)g-i-tavaz-eb-i-a                -tvis, Pluperfect š e -
(mo-)g-e-tavaz-eb-in-a -tvis.
      For 'laugh at, mock' the endings in all Series are the same as for the
basic Medial (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-i 'you laugh' (Future (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb =>
Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-e => Perfect g-i-cin-i-?a), but in the Future Sub-
Series and in Series 11 the indirect object prefix takes the place of the i-
versioniser and in addition the preverb da- is always prešent, giving da-
(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-i/da-(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-eb 'you (will) mock X/them'. This
contrasts with the Objective Version coupled to the basic Medial (Ø-Ø-)u-
cin-i/ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-cin-eb 'you (will) look at X/them and laugh' 1Ø1
(Perfect ga-g-i-cin-i-?a -tvis), which has the synonym še-(mo-)(Ø-)s-
cin-i/še-(mo-)(Ø-?Ø-)s-cin-eb (Perfect še-(mo-)g-i-cin-eb-i-?a
-tvis); cf. the semelfactives ga-(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb 'you will break into a
laugh' (Perfect ga-g-i-cin-i-?a), ča-(Ø-?Ø-)i-cin-eb 'you will laugh
quietly to yourself' vs ča-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-cin-eb 'you will laugh quietly to
X/them' (Perfect ša-g-i-cin-i-?a -tvis). The formally bipersonal (but
monovalent) prefixal Intransitive Verb-form (ga-)g-e-cin-eb-?a is, of
course, an Indirect Verb (see 4.7.4) with the 2nd person addressee here the
(unintentional) laugher as the verb-form means 'you (will) break out into a
laugh' (=> Aorist ga-g-e-cin-?a => Perfect ga-g-cin-eb-i-?a).
      [It might be thought that 'smile' would behave the same way as 'laugh',
but this is not so. KEGl recognises no verb-form of the type *(Ø-)gim-
i / ( Ø - ? Ø - ) i - g i m - e b , quoting g i m - i as an alternative to the
Masdar/abstract-noun gim+il-i; and Tschenkčli's Dictionary quotes such a
Prešent Indicative as (Ø-)gim-i only as a theoretical construct on the
basis of the form (Ø-Ø-)u-gim-i with Objective Version, given below.

smilingly down upon X/them' is restricted to the Prešent Sub-Series and
should be compared with a group of similar verb-forms prešented under
'see' in 4.1Ø. However, the parallels še-(mo-)(Ø-Ø-)gim-i 'you look

     The verb for 'shout' is (Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-i (Imperfect (Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-d-
i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-od-i) => Aorist (Ø-?Ø-)i-)ax-e => Perfect g-i-)ax-(n-)i-
?a, which also serves for the abšent Future Sub-Series, for the anticipated
Medial Future (Ø-Ø-)i-)ax-eb is actually the formal Prešent 'you
summon/call out X/them', used with a variety of preverbs but especially
ga-mo-, as in the expression ekim-s ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-)ax-eb 'you will
call out the doctor' (Aorist ekim-i ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-)ax-e, Perfect ekim-i
ga-mo-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a/ga-mo-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a), which does not differ
in meaning from ekim-s ga-mo-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-eb (Aorist ekim-s ga-
mo-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-e, Perfect ekim-is-tvis ga-mo-g-i-)ax-eb-i-?a).
With Objective Version attached to the basic Medial we have (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-
jax-i (Imperfect (Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-d-i/(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-od-i), which
means either 'you (will) shout to X/them' or analysed as (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-i
'you (will) give the name X to Y/them' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-)ax-e => Perfect
g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a -tvis), in which latter šense (Ø-Ø-Ø-)u-c'od-eb 1 0 3    is a
synonym; in the Prešent Sub-Series only (Ø-(?)Ø-Ø-)e-)ax-i (Imperfect

quotes, interestingly without any indirect object affix indicated, š ( Ø -
?Ø-)jax-eb 'you will shout out in excitement' (Perfect še-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-

KEGl but with two meanings and two partly differentiated paradigms: in
the šense 'you will start to sing out song X' the Perfect is še-mo-g-i-)ax-
(n-)i-a, whilst in the šense of 'you will address (some words) loudly to a
by-stander Y' the Perfect is š m o - g - i - ) a x - e b - i - a -tvis). For ča-(Ø-
Ø-)s-]ax-i/ša-(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb 'you (will shout something down into at
X/them' the Perfect is given as ča-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis, whereas for a-
(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-eb 'you will shout something up to X/them' only non-Prešent
Sub-Series forms are given (Perfect a-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis). mo-(Ø-
?Ø-)s-)ax-i is glossed as 'you sound a reply to X/them' or 'you follow
someone coming in this direction shouting at them' whilst mo-(Ø-Ø-)s-)ax-
eb (Perfect mo-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a -tvis) is said to be a synonym for the
locative Versional mo-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-)ax-eb (Perfect mo-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a
-tvis) 'you will suddenly hurl a loud verbal message hither at X/them' 104;
and mi-(Ø-?Ø-)s-)ax-i is 'you follow someone going somewhere else
shouting at them', with mi-(Ø-Ø-)s-]ax-eb (Perfect mi-g-i-)ax-(n-)i-a
-tvis) said to be a synonym for the locative Versional mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-
jax-eb (Perfect mi-g-i-)ax-eb-i-a -tvis) 'you will suddenly hurl a loud
verbal message thither at X/them'105.
    The pattern just illustrated with preverbs m o - / m i - combining with the
locative Version is found with a number of other verbs to indicate
suddenly shouting at someone with the particular voice-quality of the
verbal root. Examples: mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'vir-eb 'you will suddenly
yell something at X/them' (Perfect mo-/mi-g-i-q'vir-eb-i-a -tvis); m o -
/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-q'iv+l-eb 'you will suddenly crow something at X/them'
(Perfect mo-/mi-g-i-q'iv+l-eb-i-a -tvis); mo-/mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-t'ir-eb
'you will suddenly tearfully shout something at X/them' (Perfect mo-/mi-g-
i-t'ir-eb-i-a -tvis);mi-(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-čxav+l-eb1Ø6                      'you will suddenly
screech/mew something at X/them' (Perfect mi-g-i-čxav+1-eb-i-a
-tvis). For the corresponding forms of 'bark' KEGl quotes only mi-(?Ø-
Ø-)a-q'ep-s '(dog) will bark at X/them' as a synonym for da-/še-(?Ø-
Ø-)u-q'ep-s; the form also differs structurally from those just listed
insofar as it has the Perfect mi-(Ø-)u-q'ep-(?n-)i-?a -tvis.
    Sometimes the e-versioniser is employed, and the verb-form has the
morpho-syntactic patterning in Series 1 and 11 of a bipersonal prefixal
Intransitive (which is to say that the subject in Series II stands in the
Nominative); in these cases there is often no formal difference between
362                       GEORGl AN GRAMMARPrešent and Future Sub-Series. When there is no preverb associated with
this formation, Series 111 departs from the morpho-syntax of an
Intransitive Verbs and simply takes the basic Medial (inverted) verb-form,
making the indirect object dependent on a suitable postposition. With two
such verbs there is a formal difference between Prešent and Future Sub-
Series: from     (Ø-)i-brjv-i/(Ø-?Ø-)i-brj+ol-eb 'you (will) fight' we have
(Ø-Ø-)e-brjv-i 'you fight X/them' => Future (Ø-Ø-)e-brj+ol-eb-i =>
Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-brj+ol-e => Perfect g-i-brj+ol-(n-)i-?a -tan; but from
(Ø-(Ø-))i-svr-i/(Ø-Ø-)i-sr+ol-eb 'you (will) shoot (X/them)' we have (Ø-
(Ø-)Ø-)e-svr-i 'you (will) shoot (X/them) at Y/them', which then gives the
Aorist (Ø-(Ø-)Ø-)e-sr+ol-e, which, though formally the expected shape,
is treated as a Transitive Verb with Ergative subject and 3rd person plural
marked by -es (rather than the anticipated -nen); the Perfect is g-i-svr-
i-a/g-i-sr+ol-(?n-)i-a -tvis. Further examples: (Ø-Ø-)e-čurčul-eb-i
'you (will) whisper/talk in whispers to X/them' => Aorist (Ø-Ø-)e-čurčul-e
=> Perfect g-i-čurčul-(n-)i-a -tvis-, (Ø-Ø-)e-(5ipc?ip-eb-i 'you (will)
talk with a lisp to X/them' (no Series III); (Ø-Ø-)e-k'amat-eb-i 'you (will)
argue with X/them' => Perfect g-i-k'amat-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-čxub-
eb-i => Perfect g-i-čxub-(?n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i 'you
(will) speak with X/them' => Perfect g-i-lap'arak'-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-
Ø-)e-musaip-eb-i = (Ø-Ø-)e-sa+ub+r-eb-i = (Ø-Ø-)e-maslaat-eb-i
= (Ø-Ø-)e-baas-eb-i 'you (will) converse with X/them' => Perfect g-i-
musaip-(n-)i-?a (etc..) -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-tamaš-eb-i 'you (will) play with
X/them' => g-i-tamaš-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-aršiq'-eb-i 'you (will) flirt
with X/them' => g-i-aräiq'-(n-)i-?a -tan; (Ø-Ø-)e-xumr-eb-i 'you (will)
joke with X/them' => Perfect g-i-xumr-(?n-)i-?a -tan.
    Some of these bipersonal Intransitive derivatives may also permit a
preverb to be used in the perfective screeves, the meaning of which seems
to be little more than an inceptive (plus an indirect object). The morpho-
syntax of these forms is entirely regular across the three Series, such that
in Series III they remain faithful to the bipersonal Intransitive paradigm
taking their subject in the Nominative and forming the screeves on a
notional Masdar-stem that incorporates the Thematic Suffix -eb (as noted
in Hewitt 1987a.335-336; and as discussed by Tuite 1993). Examples: da-
(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i      = ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i = g a - m o -
(Ø-Ø-)e-sa+ub+r-eb-i         'you will engage X/them in conversation' =>
Perfect da-(Ø-Ø-)lap'arak'-eb-i-x+ar = ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)lap'arak'-eb-
i-x+ar = ga-mo-(Ø-Ø-)sa+ub+r-eb-i-x+ar; ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-tamaš-eb-i
'you will start to play with X/them' => Perfect ga-(Ø-)s-tamaš-eb-i-
x+ar; ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-aršiq'-eb-i 'you will start to flirt with X/them' =>
Perfect ga-(Ø-Ø-)aršiq'-eb-i-x+ar; ga-(Ø-Ø-)e-xumr-eb-i 'you will

    Occasionally the preverbal form changes from an Intransitive to
Transitive Verb-form with indirect object, so that if a person will start a
conversation with someone at his side, this may be expressed literally,
using one of the Intransitive Verb-forms just prešented, as: gverd-it
m+q'+op-s ga-mo-(Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-a; alternatively the Transitive
form (i+s) gada-(?Ø-Ø-}u-lap'arak'-eb-s (Aorist (man) gada-(?Ø-
Ø-)u-lap'arak'-a, Perfect (ma-s) gada-(Ø-)u-lap'arak'-eb-i-?a 107
ma-s-tan) encapsulates this notion entirely within itself; if the speaking to
one's neighbour is soft, then (5a-(?Ø-Ø-)u-lap,arak,-eb-s is used, which,
according to KEGl, contrasts with the bipersonal Intransitive with this
preverb, namely ča-(Ø-Ø-)e-lap'arak'-eb-i, for which the meaning is
'you will talk down to X/them' (e.g. of a person to a dog). Another such
Transitive is ga-(Ø-?Ø-Ø-)u-tamaš-eb 'you will skirt X/them playing;
you will start to play with X/them' (Perfect ga-g-i-tamaš-eb-i-?a -tan),
where, however, we have an alternative Intransitive, but this time it is the
inceptive suffixal Intransitive in Objective Version (viz. ga-(Ø-Ø-)u-
tamaš-d-eb-i => Perfect ga-(Ø-)s-tamaš-eb-i-x-a+r)!
364                          GEORGIANGRAMMAR4.7.4 Indirect Verb Class (inversi+ul-i zmn-eb-is k'las-i)However they were originally conceived, Indirect Verbs today are those
whose (logical) subject, no matter what the Series, stands in the Dative
case and is co-referenced in the verb-form by means of an agreement-
affix of Set B, whilst the (logical) direct object, no matter what the Series,
stands in the Nominative case and is co-referenced in the verb-form by
means of an agreement-affix of Set A—allGEORGIANverbs must carry at
the very least a Set A affix, but for some Indirect Verbs there may be no
Nominative nominal external to the verb to provide a concrete referent for
the relevant affix. Since the Dative nominal is today perceived to be the
subject, an appropriate 3rd person plural Dative will have its plurality
marked on the verb but only in the prešence of a 3rd person direct object,
whilst the plurality of a 3rd person Nominative will, of course, never be
marked on the verb today, because this is viewed as the direct object, and
direct objects do not (prescriptively at any rate) have their plurality
signalled in the verb. This gives us, for example, mk'vidr-eb-s s-)ul-t
m o + m + x d + u r - i / m o + m + x d + u r - e b - i 'the natives hate the incomer/
incomers', which is a reversal of the older pattern of agreement, whereby
the plurality of the 3rd person Dative was ignored, whilst that of the 3rd
person Nominative was indeed marked on the verb, giving as the older
part-equivalent to the above: mk'vidr-s/mk'vidr-eb-s                          s-)ul-an
mo+m+xd+ur-eb-i 'the native/natives hate(s) the incomers'. This devel­
opment in the pattern of agreement suggests that originally it was the
Nominative nominal which was interpreted as the subject, whereas the
Dative nominal will at that time have been the indirect object of a normal
bivalent Intransitive Verb; such agreement is common in traditional folk­
tales and is found in the works of the late 19th to the early 2Øth century
writer Vazha Pshavela.
     It is sometimes difficult, especially with verbs containing the Indirect
Object Versioniser, to tell whether we are dealing with a bivalent
Intransitive Verb or an Indirect Verb. In 4.1 we mentioned the different
agreement-patterns for the verb 'be born to' as attested in the two
examples from the 19th century writers Ilia C'avč'avadze and Ak'ak'i
Ts'ereteli respectively, namely:      si+t'q'v+a-n-i gul-ši       m-e-bad-eb-i-an
      word-Pl-NOM      heart-in me-IOV-be.born-TS-PRES.INDIC-PL
      'words/speeches are born to me in the heart (= are born in my heart)'

     child-Pl-NOM (3rd.PER-)I OV-be.born-TS-3rd.PER-Pl
     'children are born to themDAT'Does this feature alone mean that the former verb-form is to be
interpreted as a bivalent Intransitive, whilst the latter is to be viewed as
an Indirect Verb? Similarly, if we translate the example p'at'ar+jal-i gv-
e-čven-o-s, p'at'ar+jal-i! 'let the bride shew herself to us, the bride!',
we would judge it to be a bivalent Intransitive, whereas if we translate the
example cot'a maril+ian-i m-e-čven-a sa+č'm+el-i 'I deemed the
food a little salty', we might be tempted to regard the verb as Indirect
(because the 1st person Dative argument is rendered in English as the
subject of the verb), whereas the translation 'the food seemed to me a little
salty' would perhaps favour a bivalent Intransitive interpretation (with 'to
me' equating to the Dative argument of theGEORGIAN).Personally, however,
I would argue that both these verbs in all the usages illustrated above are
to be interpreted as bivalent Intransitives.
    In the Prešent Sub-Series the Dative subject is sometimes marked by
means of the agreement-affix alone; alternatively some verb-forms require
the prešence of the Objective Version, others the prešence of the locative
Version, and yet others the prešence of the Indirect Object Version. In
the Future Sub-Series, on the other hand, many Indirect Verbs take the
form of a prefixal Intransitive with obligatory e-versioniser.       Indirect
Verbs proper possess no Series II screeves, and so the Imperfect and
Prešent Subjunctive will take the place of the anticipated Aorist Indicative
and Aorist Subjunctive respectively. The Imperfect Indicative (and Prešent
Subjunctive) will take either -d- or -od- as post-radical marker according
to the requirements of the verb-form in question. In Series III Indirect
Verbs have the basic morphology of bivalent Intransitives, which is to say
that the stem is the Masdar, though it is of course necessary to know the
correct form of the Masdar, which in some cases might not be a
straightforward matter.
    In the Prešent Indicative a 1st or 2nd person direct object is indicated
by attaching to the stem the appropriate form of the Prešent tense of the
copula, whilst a 3rd person Nominative nominal is indicated by either -s or
-a, as required by the verb in question. Since it is verb-forms rather than
roots which are classified for conjugational type, readers will by now have
come to expect that the root of any given Indirect Verb is likely to have
cognate verb-forms of other conjugational types; these will be pointed out
as we go along.
366                         GEORGIANGRAMMAR    l e t us illustrate the general principles of formation according to
screeve-(Sub-)Series by taking first the root -nd- 'want', which, when the
direct object is 1st or 2nd person adds an extra - i - between root and
agreement-suffix. The basic paradigms shew changing Dative subject
keeping a constant 3rd person Nominative direct object (producing
meanings for the Prešent Indicative of this root of 'I want X/them', 'you
want X/them', etc.):

part-exponent for the Dative subject. With variable arguments for the
Prešent Indicative we have: m-i-nd-i-x-a+r 'I want you', m-i-nd-i-x-
a+r-t 'I want you(Pl)', g-i-nd-i-v-a+r 'you want me', g-i-nd-i-v-a+r-t

i-nd-i-x-a+r(-t) 'we want you(/you(Pl.))'. The Imperfect and Prešent
Subjunctive follow the normal patterns of agreement, as demonstrated by:
m-i-nd-od-i(-t) 'I wanted you(/you(Pl.))', (Ø-Ø-)u-nd-od-i(-t) 'X/they

me/X/them'.
     In the Future Sub-Series the verb takes on the morphology of a
bivalent prefixal Intransitive but with a root now expanded to -nd+om-
(cf. the Masdar nd+om-a 'wanting'), producing the following paradigms:      Future Sub-Series of -nd-

    The forms given above for the Future Sub-Series have a stative force
as far as their semantics are concerned, namely 'be in a state of wanting'.
However, in English such statements as 'I (etc..) shall want X' may be taken
to mean 'I (etc..) shall experience a desire for X' or 'I (etc..) shall conceive
a desire for X'. The former of these alternative interpretations is treated
inGEORGIANas a Dynamic equivalent to the Stative forms already set out
and consists morphologically of the sequence Preverb mo- + Agreement-
prefix + Objective Version + Root + Thematic Suffix - e b - + the same
endings as for a regular Intransitive Verb in the Prešent-Future, giving:

xan+da+xan k'oxt'+a+oba mo-(Ø-)u-nd-eb-od-a 'Datuna from time to
time would experience the desire to be dressed neatly', the forms may
convey the notion 'need' (e.g. vano-s 1+od+in-i did+xan+s ar mo-
(Ø-)u-nd-eb-a 'Vano will not need to wait long'). Clearly with these
meanings the verb-forms are still functioning Indirectly insofar as the
subject is still the Dative nominal. However, the verb-form (throughout its
paradigm) may function as a 'normal' (i.e. non-Indirect) Intransitive Verb;
the subject is now the Nominative nominal, and the verb, functioning as a
synonym to the Transitive Verbs (mo-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-nd+om-eb or (še-)(Ø-
Ø-Ø-)a-l-ev 'you (will) devote X (often = amount of time) to activity Y',
may be construed with two Dative (object) nominals (thus: pot-a-mde or

digging the earth').
    The second alternative interpretation mentioned above is treated in
GEORGIANas an active voiced Transitive Verb of the form (mo-)(Ø-Ø-)i-
nd+om-eb 'you (will) conceive a desire for X/them', which behaves like
any normal Transitive Verb with Thematic Suffix -eb in terms both of its
morphology and syntax, e.g.      g lex-ma       c'er+a=k'itx+v-is sc'avl+a           mo-(Ø-)i-nd+om-a

      'the peasant conceived a desire to study writing and reading'   The final versional form, given that we have illustrated the locative
and Subjective forms already, is the Objective, as seen in examples like:

(but only in the Present Indicative!) we have the root -kv- 'have inanimate
X', which in the Imperfect Indicative and Present Subjunctive becomes
-k+on-, thus:   Present Sub-Series of -kv-

such forms as m-a-kv-x-a+r 'I have you' are artificial and not met.
Colloquially the Present Indicative is often reduced to: m-a-k, g-a-k,
(Ø-)a-k, gv-a-k, g-a-k-t, (Ø-)a-k-t.
    In the Future Sub-Series suppletion occurs, the form being the
bipersonal equivalent of the Future Sub-Series of the copula; such notions
as 'X will have Y' are literally then in origin in Georgian 'Y will be to/for X'
(consider Latin id ei erit), thus:   Future Indicative        Conditional                Future Subjunctive

either k+on-a or k + on-eb-a, the latter being also used nominally as
'possessions'110), thus:

   h-k+on-i-a-t            h-k+on-od-a-t             h-k+on-od-e-t     The root -k+on-, expanded by -i-, is found in the Future Sub-Series
(and from there in Series 11 and III), as part of the regular active voiced
Transitive Verb (Ø-Ø-)i-k+on+i-eb 'you will acquire/have inanimate
X/them' (Aorist (Ø-Ø-)i-k+on+i-e, Perfect g-i-k+on+i-eb-i-a). It is
often difficult to see why in any individual instantiation of this verb
preference is given to it over the Indirect equivalent—for example there is
little to choose for the translation of 'let us hope so (lit. have hope)!'
between the Indirect expression imed-i gv-k+on-d-e-s! and the common
Transitive expression imed-i v-(Ø-)i-k+on+i-o-t!.
     By adding a preverb to the Prešent Sub-Series screeves one produces
the GEORGI AN for 'take/bring inanimate X/them in some specified
direction'—the preverbs have the same force as described for their use
with verbs of motion. Examples: c'ign-i mo-m-a-k(v-s) 'I am bringing
the book' vs ga-m-a-k(v-s) 'I am taking it out' vs a-m-a-k(v-s) 'I am
taking it up' vs še-mo-m-a-k(v-s) 'I am bringing it in' vs mi-m-a-k(v-s)
'I am taking it' vs da-m-a-k(v-s) 'I am carrying it around' 111 . Outside the
Prešent Sub-Series this notion is expressed Transitively by means of a Root
Verb with Subjective Version in the Future Sub-Series and Series II, e.g.
c'ign-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-t'an 'you will fetch the book' vs c'ign-i mo-(Ø-
Ø-)i-t'an-e 'you fetched the book' vs c'ign-i mo-g-i-t'an-i-a 'you have
fetched the book'.
     The root employed for 'have' when the possessed entity is animate
demonstrates an Indirect Verb where, in the Prešent Sub-Series, no
versioniser is used, thus:Prešent Sub-Series of -q'+av-

screeves (viz. Aorist Indicative g-e-q'+ol-a vs Subjunctive g-e-q'+ol-

theGEORGIANfor 'take/bring animate X/them in some specified direction'—
the preverbs have the same force as described for their use with verbs of
motion. Examples: maimun-i mo-m-q'+av-s 'I am bringing the monkey' vs
ga-m-q'+av-s 'I am taking it out' vs a-m-q'+av-s 'I am taking it up' vs
š m o - m - q ' + a v - s 'I am bringing it in' vs mi-m-q'+av-s 'I am taking it' vs

is/they taking me(/us) out', š m o - ( Ø - ) g v - q ' + a v - x - a + r-t 'we are
bringing you(Pl.) in'. Outside the Prešent Sub-Series this notion is expressed
Transitively by means of a Root Verb with Subjective Version in the Future
Sub-Series and Series II, e.g. maimun-s mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'van 'you will fetch
the monkey' vs maimun-i mo-(Ø-Ø-)i-q'van-e 'you fetched the monkey'
374                         GEORGIANGRAMMARvs maimun-i mo-g-i-q'van-i-a 'you have fetched the monkey'. The
forms da-(0-0-)i-q'van => Aorist da-(0-0-)i-qVan-e => Perfect da-g-
i-q'van-i-a are used in the sense of 'reduce, conduct X/them to a certain
point', which in the Present is seen in: ara+ra+oba-mde da-h-q'+av-s
'X reduces Y/them to nothingness'.

object, as shewn. When it is necessary to translate a šentence like 'I

(5ven-i 'you(Pl) understood us', (Ø-)e-sm-i-s ma-t-i 'X understands

   Other important Indirect Verbs are:love = -q'var- (cf. si-q'var-l-ii         'love')
g-i-q'var-s 'you love X/them' (v-(Ø-)u-q'var-v-a+r 'X loves/they love
me') => Imperfect g-i-q'var-d-a => Future g-e-q'var-eb-a => Perfect g-
q'var-eb-i-a. The notion 'falling in love' is expressed as a suffixal
Intransitive, still with Dative subject, which naturally exists in all three
Series: (še-)g-i-q'var-d-eb-a 'you (will) fall in love with X/them' =>
Aorist š g - i - q ' v a r - d - a => Perfect š g - q ' v a r - e b - i - a . The notion
'conceive a love for' is expressed as a normal Transitive Verb with
Subjective Version, viz. (šXØ-Ø-)i-q'var-eb 1 1 8 'you (will) conceive a
love for X/them'; cf. the same with locative Version (še-)(Ø-Ø-Ø-)a-
qVar-eb 'you (will) get X/them to love Y/them' (e.g. še-(Ø-)g-a-q'var-e
tav-i 'I got you to love me')—the Masdar of both these versional forms is
šq'var-eb-a.             The Causative hardly differs in meaning from the
previous form with locative Version (e.g. k'ac-ma še-(Ø-Ø-)a-q'var-eb-
in-a tav-i kal-s da še-(Ø-)i-rt-o 'the man got the woman to love him
and married her'). There is also in the Prešent Sub-Series the non-Indirect
Verb (Ø-)h-q'var-ob 'youNOM are the lover (= sa-q'var-el-i) of X D A T '
(e.g. čem-i col-i xel+m+c'ip+e-s h-q'var-ob-d-a 'my wife used to be
the lover of the emperor'), though this verb can also be used as a synonym
for 'love' but with Nominative subject and Dative object (e.g. kart+v+el-i
k'ac-i ar m-q'var-ob-s 'GEORGIANmen (lit. man) don't love me')—the
Masdar is q'var-eb-a.","[375, 376, 377, 378, 379, 380, 381, 382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389, 390, 391, 392, 393, 394, 395]"
"5.1.1.5 Dative (mi+c+em+it-i)This case proto-typically marks (a) indirect objects but can also mark(b) some direct objects as well as(c) some logical subjects;
(d) a number of postpositions govern the Dative; (e) it parallels the
Nominative in temporal expressions of duration and regularity (e.g. q'ovel
dge-s/tve-s/k'vira-s/game-s/c'el-s 'every day/month/week/night/
year');(f) stating the day and, if the month is mentioned, dates requires the Dative
(e.g. šabat-s 'on Saturday', p'irvel mais-s first May-DAT = 'on 1st May',
or noember-s 2 November-DAT = 'on 2nd November—N.B. the cardinal
is used for numbers not involving the element 'first'), whereas the
postposition -Si is used if only the number is given (e.g. p'irvel-ši 'on the
 1st', or-ši 'on the 2nd')—other specific time-points include: dila-s 'in the
morning', sa(+)gam(+)o-s 'in the evening', na + sadil + e v - s 'in the
afternoon', dge-s 'today', šua-dge-s 'at mid-day' (cf. the GEN-DAT ending
in the synonymous šua-dg-isa-s, and note that for 'at mid-night' only this
complex ending šua-gam-isa-s is offered in the dictionaries),
na+šua+gam+ev-s 'in the early hours';(g) today the postpositions -šl 'in, at' and -ze 'on, at' are usually employed
where OldGEORGIANcould happily have used just the Dative, and there are
at least three nouns where the simple Dative (albeit with an unusual a-
vowel before the Dative-suffix -s) are stIII as common as the postpositional
equivalents (viz. a+m a+dg+il-as/a+dg+il-ze 'at this place', a+m c'ut-

z e / k ' i d e - z e as in č'-is p'ir-as 'on the edge of the well', m i n d v r - i s
na+p'ir-as 'on the edge of the meadow');(h) The verb 'to prefer' is an Indirect Verb with logical subject in the
Dative and logical object in the Nominative. Nevertheless, the entity to
which the logical object is preferred, when expressed, also stands in the
Dative, e.g.      m-i-rč(+)ev(+)n-i-a       p'ur-i      gorn-s
      I -OV-prefer-PRES-it      bread-NOM grits-DAT

      'the woman prefers me to you'     In the related Mingrelian language the postposition -s'a must attach to
the entity preferred (e.g. respectively for these same meanings m-i-sxun-
u kobal-i gum-ša and osur-s v-(Ø-)u-sxun-u-k skan+i dud+i-ša);

Dative accompanying the Masdar.","[550, 551]"
"4.7.1.3.1 Perfect (p'irvel-i turme+ob+it-i)
This screeve'sGEORGIANdesignation translates as 'First Evidential/
Apparential/Inferential', for it is usually stated that the screeve is
employed when the speaker is referring to a past action which he did not
himself witness but assumes took place either on the basis of some prešent
result (e.g. wet ground suggests the past occurrence of rain) or because
someone has told him that it did. Certainly the Perfect is indeed found in
such contexts, with or without the particle turme 'apparently', e.g.   varsken-s   ianvr-is    rva-s          p'irvel-ad    (Ø-)u-c'am-eb-i-a

singular = -v-a+r (N.B. with a prefixai copy of the element v- standing
before the versioniser), 2nd person singular = - x - a + r , 3rd person
singular/plural = either -a or -s depending on verb-type, 1st person plural
= -v-a+r-t (N.B. with a prefixai copy of the element v- standing before
the versioniser), 2nd person plural = -x-a+r-t; in other words it is
esšentially the Prešent Indicative of the copula which is used to mark the
direct object in the Perfect. The paradigms prešented below are for a
changing subject (viz. Dative nominal) with constant 3rd person (singular or
plural) direct object.","[278, 279, 280]"
