"         When used as a modifier to a head noun, the genitive phrase usually precedesthe head noun (see §4.3 on word order within noun phrases).",[229]
"        Grammatically speaking, the order of modifiers in relation to the head nounis rather free; constituents in a noun phrase can be scrambled to any order and stillbe grammatical (except for certain genitive phrases with ellipted genitive clitic, inwhich case the genitive phrase must precede the head noun; §4.5.3). However, thereare tendencies as to whether a modifier precedes or follows the head noun:4             •   Relative clauses nearly always precede head nouns;             •   There is a weak tendency of possessive phrases being placed in front                 of the head noun;             •   Demonstratives are nearly always at the left or right edge of the noun                 phrase;             •   There are weak tendencies for non-numeral quantifiers and lower                 numerals (‘three’ and below) to follow the head noun;             •   Adjectives (§3.1.2) tend to be closer to the head noun than other noun                 modifiers within the same noun phrase; adjectives which denote                 dimensions (e.g. bukwa ‘big’, tikyawi ‘small’, blufa ‘short’) tend to                 follow the head noun; other adjectives tend to may precede the head                 noun.",[212]
"       We have seen in §5.4 that intraclausal syntax play a minor role in MenggwaDla. Clauses are most usually verb-final, and the order of the constituents in frontof the clause is free. Some clauses have one constituent after the verb; this post-verbal constituent give further information towards a reference mentioned earlier inthe clause or earlier in the discourse. However, this is not a manifestation of right-dislocation or anti-topic in their prototypical sense, as the post-verbal constituentform a single intonation domain with the rest of the clause in front of it, and thepost-verbal constituent can express either new or old information.",[348]
Clauses are predominantly verb-final; phrases in front of the verb can be scrambledto any order. Sometimes a focused phrase can be placed after the verb.,[23]

4.3       Noun modifiers,
               modifiers, word order in NP and noun compounds          Noun phrases can be clearly identified in Menggwa Dla, as the head nounand its modifiers are always contiguous to each other. The syntactic positions ofnominal clitics (§4.5) also testify to the existence of noun phrases — nominal cliticshave the last independent word in a noun phrase as their host.4-22. [wuli       bukwa imbu=mbi/       wuli imbu bukwa=mbi] ni-wi.          [house big      two=PROP/     house two   big=PROP]       COP:PRES-N1FPL          ‘They have two big houses.’A head noun can be modified by one or more of the following modifiers:      •   adjectives (§3.1.2);      •   demonstrative (§3.2.4);      •   quantifier (§3.2.5);
                                           197
    •   genitive phrase (§3.1.2; §4.5.3);    •   proprietive/ abessive phrase (§3.1.2; §4.5.5); and/ or    •   relative clause (§7.1.1).","[211, 212]"
"        A noun phrase can be encliticised by a case clitic, and/or a topic or focusclitic (§4.5). Menggwa Dla has a range of semantic case clitics, with the local caseshaving an internal versus external distinction. A head noun and its modifiers mustbe contiguous with each other to form a noun phrase. However, within a nounphrase, the word order is basically free (§4.3). Proper names in Menggwa Dla arenot morphologically distinguished from common nouns (§4.4).",[20]
"                                           258
       Intraclausal syntax plays a minor role in Menggwa Dla. Most clauses areverb-final, and the order amongst the free constituents (noun phrases and otherwords) before the verb is free. Nevertheless, one constituent can occupy the post-verbal position; this constituent further specifies the identity of a referencementioned earlier in the clause (or sometimes in previous clauses). These post-verbal constituents form the same intonation domain with the rest of the clause infront of it, and these post-verbal constituents can express either old or newinformation; hence these post-verbal constituents are not manifestations of right-dislocation or anti-topics in their prototypical sense. See §5.4 on intraclausal syntax.","[272, 273]"
"If both the object and second object (pro)nominals are present in a clause, therelative order of the object and the second object is also free. Objects take anoptional object suffix =mbo (§4.5.1).

       The following are some examples of complex noun phrases which may ormay not follow the word-order tendencies outlined above. It is grammatical toscramble the order of a head noun and its modifying phrases to any order, hence it isimpossible for noun phrases with three or more constituents to consist of hierarchiesof binary noun phrases.

"6.4.1   Copulas        Copula is a special class of verb in Menggwa Dla. Like other verbs, copulasalso have finite forms which carry cross-referencing and non-finite forms which donot. However, as the main verb of a clause, finite copulas only head independentclauses (§6), and the non-finite copulas only head non-finite chain clauses (§7.3.2)(copulas are not used as the main verb of subordinate clauses (§7.1) and chainclauses (§7.2); see also §6.4.3 on auxiliary copulas). Moreover, finite copulas markless tense-aspect-mood categories than ordinary verbs, and the way tense-aspect-mood-polarity categories are expressed in copulas is also mostly different from thosein ordinary verbs (§6.1-3). The following table summarises the copulas in MenggwaDla; the copulas are introduced in the listed order in the rest of this section.",[408]

       Relative clauses must exist within noun phrases, but relative clauses need notbe adjacent to the head noun, as shown in the following example. In the followingexample, the head noun hwafo ‘talk’ is modified by two modifiers: the genitivephrase amamo=la ‘of the moon’ and the relative clause hohohiahya ‘which theytold’. The order of modifiers within a noun phrase is grammatically free (§4.3); thehead noun and its modifiers can be in any order within the noun phrase.7-24. [[hoho-hi-a-hya]          amamo=la hwafo

       Chapter 3 is an overview of the word classes in Menggwa Dla; the
morphological, syntactic and semantic properties of the three major word classes
(nouns, adjectives and verbs) and the minor word classes are compared in this
chapter. Chapter 4 describes the properties of nouns and noun phrases; the person-
number-gender categories, noun-phrasal syntax, nominal clitics and personal
pronouns are outlined in this chapter. Menggwa Dla has a rich array of case, topic
and focus markers which comes in the form of clitics (§4.5). Subject pronouns
(‘citation pronouns’) only mark person (i.e. one for each of the three persons),
whereas object and genitive pronouns mark person (including inclusive/exclusive
first person), number, and sometimes also gender features (§4.6).",[2]

       The following is the translation given to me when I attempted to elicit ‘I sawmyself in the photo’ (Bahasa Indonesia: saya melihat saya sendiri dalam foto ((1SGsee 1SG self in photo), Tok Pisin: mi lukim mi yet long foto).4-169. yo ahu hombafluma(=mbo) foto=hi                homba-ha-a-hwa.         .       1   self face(=OBJ)             photo=ADS see-1SG-3FSG:O-PAST       ‘I saw my face in the photo.’ (50II)       First of all, notice that the object is expressed as a third person entity;expressing both the subject and the object as first person is simply not possible inMenggwa Dla. Secondly, the word ahu indicates that there is a possessive relationbetween two grammatical relations in the clause (based on the semantics, the objecthombafluma ‘face’ is possessed by the subject yo ‘I’), but the word ahu is not partof the object noun phrase hombafluma(=mbo) ‘face(=OBJ)’. This can beestablished by the fact that the word ahu can exist in positions which are explicitlynot within any case-marked phrases:4-170. yo hombafluma(=mbo) foto=hi               ahu homba-ha-a-hwa.          .       1   face(=OBJ)              photo=ADS self see-1SG-3FSG:O-PAST       ‘I saw my face in the photo.’       Another related fact is that the word ahu cannot take a case clitic (§4.5). Forinstance, the following examples involve a constituent occupying the post-verbalposition (any one constituent can occupy the post-verbal position; see §5.4). No

        Nouns in their citation forms can also be used as noun modifiers.

"        Overall, grammatical relations in Menggwa Dla are aligned in an accusative-secundative alignment (§5.3.1): intransitive subjects [S] and transitive subjects [A]are marked similarly (‘subject’), monotransitive objects [P] are marked similarly asditransitive first objects [R] (the recipient relation; ‘(first) object’), and ditransitivesecond objects [T] (the theme/ ‘gift’ relation) is treated separately. In terms ofcross-referencing, subjects are cross-referenced by subject cross-reference suffixes,(first) objects are cross-referenced by object cross-reference suffixes, and secondobjects are never cross-referenced on the verb.

However, this coreference between the topic-object ofthe first clause and the subject of the second clause is ignored by the SR morphemesbecause SR morphemes only monitor the syntactic subjects, which are disjoint-referential in this case. In the first clause, the subject noun phrase nyewi ‘person’ iscross-referenced by -ya (N1FSG) on the verb (people of unknown gender are cross-referenced as feminine; §4.1.1), and the subject of the second clause is -Ø (3MSG),which can be inferred as coreferential with the 3MSG reference of the previous clause,Pius.",[476]

       Chapter 5 introduces various morphological and syntactic issues which are
common to both independent and dependent clauses: verb stems, verb classes,
                                           ii
cross-referencing, intraclausal syntax, syntactic transitivity and semantic valence.
Cross-referencing in Menggwa Dla is complex: there are seven paradigms of subject
cross-reference suffixes and four paradigms of object cross-references. Based on
their cross-referencing patterns, verbs are classified into one of five verb classes
(§5.2). There is often a mismatch between the number of cross-reference suffixes,
the semantic valence, and the syntactic transitivity within a clause. There are verbs
where the subject cross-reference suffix, or the object suffix, or both the subject and
object suffixes are semantically empty (‘dummy cross-reference suffixes’; §5.3.2).","[2, 3]"
"        Thirdly, there is one syntactic property which distinguishes subject fromother grammatical relations: only subjects can be the pivots for switch-reference, i.e.the references which switch-reference markers monitor as being coreferential ordisjoint-referential (§7.2). Cross-linguistically, being switch-reference pivots is not avery good indicator of subjecthood as switch-reference pivots are not always thesyntactic subjects in some languages (in other languages a switch-reference marker15
  As cross-reference suffixes are pronominal (§5.3.2), cross-reference suffixes within externally-
headed relative clauses are functionally similar to resumptive pronouns in relative clauses in other
languages.",[312]
"       One major difference between the Senagi languages and the surroundinglanguages is that Senagi languages are heavily into clause-chaining whereas thesurrounding languages are not, except Karkar-Yuri. All surrounding languages havesimple verbal cross-reference systems, typically cross-referencing only with thenumber of the subject; this contrasts with the Senagi languages which have multiplesets of cross-reference suffixes for both subject and object, marking number, personand sometimes gender features. Comparing with surrounding languages, the Senagilanguages have a richer inventory of case markers.",[62]

4.6.4   The ‘reflexive’ word ahu        The prototypical notion of reflexivity involves one grammatical positionexpressed as coreferential with another grammatical position within the same clause,and that the two grammatical positions have different semantic roles. This type ofreflexivity cannot be expressed in Menggwa Dla, i.e. the core and oblique relationswithin a clause cannot be coreferential with each other. For example, reflexivecross-reference suffix combinations — i.e. first person subject with first personobject and second person subject with second person object — do not exist (§5.3.1).","[266, 267]"

Sowanda. In other publications like Laycock (1973), Imonda and Punda are not considered separate

   In Imonda, there is also a trill /r/ phoneme which only occurs in ‘sound words’ (:11). In addition,
in approaching adulthood, young people learn to distinguish /ɨ/ from /i/ and /ʉ/ from /u/ for a
small set of words. For example, for children ‘put’ (plural subject) and ‘lie’ are both /li/; when
approaching adulthood they have to learn that ‘put’ (plural subject) is /li/ and ‘lie’ is ‘lɨ’. Including
these ‘adulthood’ vowels, Imonda has twelve vowel phonemes (Seiler 1985: 20-21).",[63]

   ‘Transitive’ here means ‘monotransitive’, i.e. having one subject and one object. It is potentially
confusing that the term ‘monovalent’ means having one semantic argument, while the term
‘transitive’ involves two core grammatical relations, and hence the term ‘monotransitive’ is avoided
here. There are indeed verbs like kefi ‘break’ (monovalent) (class IIB) which are monovalent-
(mono)transitive (§5.3.3); having the same prefix mono- used for both valency and transitivity can be
confusing.

3.2.3   Interrogative words        The position of an interrogative word in a clause is the same as in thecorresponding non-interrogative counterpart (i.e. in situ), albeit intraclausal syntax israther free (§5.4). These interrogative words occur by themselves, not being part ofanother phrase (‘interrogative pronouns’). Two of them, namely dahala ~ da=la‘whose’ and naho ‘which’ can also act as modifiers of head nouns (‘interrogativeadjectives’). On par with personal pronouns (§3.2.2; §4.6), the interrogative wordfor ‘who’ also has a citation form da ‘who’, an object form dafumbo ‘whom’ and agenitive form dahala/ dala ‘whose’.        da                     ‘who’        dafumbo                ‘whom’ (who:OBJ)        dahala/ da=la          ‘whose’ (who:GEN/ who=GEN)        ga                     ‘where’        guku                   ‘how’        naho                   ‘what’/ ‘which’        nahombo                ‘why’          (but naho=mbo (what=OBJ) ‘what’)        nuŋgni                 ‘when’        nuŋgwi                 ‘how many’/ ‘how much’        There are also special interrogative copulas: de ‘who be’ and ke ‘where be’(§6.4.1).

2.2.4   Vowel restrictions        There is no instance of a lexical morpheme containing more than one /e/, and/ʊ/ is not found at the beginning of native words (there is a Papuan Malay loanwordoto /ʊtʊ/ ‘car’).19,20        There are few monomorphemic vowel sequences. Apart from /ei/, all vowelsequences have an /a/ vowel: /ai/, /au/, /ia/, /ʊa/ and /ua/. These vowel sequences aresyllabified as two different syllables (the usual maximum shape of syllables is CCV;§2.2.1). The stress-placements in the following words also indicates that the vowelsequences are syllabified as two separate syllables (primary stress falls on thepenultimate syllable for nouns; §2.4.1), e.g. yaflei /ja.ɸ

remnants of an earlier stage of the language when consonant clusters are much less restrictive.
19
   The [– low] [– high] vowels of /e/ and /ʊ/ are comparatively rare. The frequency of the five vowel
phonemes in a 200 item Menggwa Dla ‘basic’ word list is as follow:
          [+ high]         /i/ <i> 23%, /u/ <u> 21%;
          [– high] [– low] /e/ <e> 7%, /ʊ/ <o> 9%; and
          [+ low]                 /a/ <a> 40%.
20
   There are some words with more than one /ʊ/ <o>: fofo ‘blow’ (which has a near minimal pair fufu
‘play flute’).",[119]
"There are eleven paradigms of cross-reference suffixes in Menggwa Dla, somecross-reference with the subject, and some cross-reference with the object. A verblexeme may have more than one verb stem form. The basic form of a verb lexemeis called the ‘non-finite verb stem’; a lot of verb lexemes also have a separate ‘finiteverb stem’ which is used in finite verb forms (§5.1.1). A small number of verbshave special a ‘future finite verb stem’ which is used only in future tense (§5.1.2).",[21]
"Different sets of pronouns are used in different positions (§4.6). There are the‘citation pronouns’ which are used in topic/ subject positions or in isolation, andthere are only three of them, each marking only a person category: yo first person(‘I’/ ‘We’), si second person (i.e. ‘you’) and ai third person (‘s/he/it/they’). Thereare also the object pronouns, genitive pronouns and subject resumptive pronounswhich have fifteen or sixteen members, each marking different person, number and                                            186

Thesimplest of them are the citation pronouns (§4.6.1). There are only three citationpronouns, one for each person, and number is not distinguished: yo first person‘I/we’, si second person ‘you’ and ai third person ‘s/he/it/they’. Citation pronounsare used in positions which cannot be case marked: in isolation, in topic position, orin subject position.

7.2.3   Hypothetical protases        Protases, in other words the ‘if’ clauses of conditional sentences, can bemarked in two different ways. Simple indicative protases, of which the truth valuecan be true or false, are expressed as irrealis -hwani clauses (§7.1.2). On the otherhand, hypothetical protases, in other words protases of which the polarity must befalse based on real word knowledge, are indicated by chain clauses. Thedependency suffix (§7.5) of a hypothetical protasis chain verb is usually -mbona, but-mbo can be used as well. Hypothetical protasis often have counterfactual apodoseswhich carries the -naho counterfactual suffix (see §6.3.4 for more examples).

"These three citation pronouns do not mark number and gender features; for instance,ai can be translated as ‘he’, ‘she’, ‘it’ or ‘they’ in English. Citation pronouns areused in isolation or when it is the subject of the clause. In contrast to the citationpronouns, the object and genitive pronouns carry a cross-reference suffix whichmarks person, number and sometimes gender features. While there are only threecitation pronouns, there are as many as fifteen object pronouns and fifteen genitivepronouns. For instance, when referring to two male referents using a pronoun, acitation pronoun ai ‘s/he/it/they’ is used when it is the subject, but a (much morefeature-specific) object pronoun aiahafanimbo ‘them two (masculine)’ is used whenit is the object.",[21]
"Firstly, the three core-grammatical relations can be distinguished by their behaviourin terms of pronominalisation: pronouns in subject positions come in the form ofcitation pronouns, pronouns in object positions come in the form of object pronouns,and second objects cannot be pronominalised (§4.6). Personal pronouns inMenggwa Dla are only used to refer to high animates (§4.6). Nevertheless, in somerare cases, oblique relations can have human referents, and they can bepronominalised in the form of an object or genitive pronoun encliticised with a caseclitic (see §4.6.2).",[311]

As an adjective, tikyawi ‘small’ is free to occupy anypositions within the noun phrase; tikyawi ‘small’ can either precede or follow thehead noun akwani ‘snake’. The independent verb yafukyauyahwa ismorphologically agglutinative; it has a past tense suffix -hwa and two crossreference suffixes: -Ø (N1SG) and -ya (1SG:O).3-1.

Different types of dependentverbs are deverbalised to various degrees. Even more deverbalised are the verbalnouns (i.e. nominalised verbs). The more salient morphosyntactic properties ofverbs, verbal nouns and nouns are discussed in §3.1.1. Property words are not alladjectives; although the adjective word class is not closed, a lot of property wordsare verbs, and some are nouns; see §3.1.2.
