                             Nxa?amxcin falls under the traditional classification of ‘polysynthetic’.
                     Words in polysynthetic languages are typically long and morphologically
                     complex, with a single word being able to express the full semantic content of a
                     complete sentence in a non-polysynthetic language.            As seems to be the case
                     with polysynthetic languages in general, Nxa?amxcin has obligatory pro-drop
                     for both subject and object position.       Thus, no subject or object pronouns are
                     overtly expressed, as shown in the following examples:8
                            8Views on clause structure in Salish languages are mainly divided into two
                     camps. The first supports the Pronominal Argument Hypothesis (e.g. Jelinek
                     1984, Jelinek and Demers 1994) according to which subject and object arguments

                     In the transitive construction in (52), the 2nd person sg. object is marked by the
                     suffix -si and the Ist sg. subject by the suffix -nn. No overt pronouns are present
                     to indicate these grammatical categories.        In example (53), the Ist person sg.
                     subject is marked by the intransitive clitic kn. Again, there is no overt intransitive
                      subject pronoun.
                             When overt noun phrases are expressed, the basic transitive word order is
                     VOS, although there is some flexibility of word order as shown in the following
                     examples:

                     are realized as pronominal elements on the predicate.          Overt noun phrases are
                     syntactic adjuncts coindexed with these pronominal elements. As adjuncts, these
                     noun phrases are able to maintain some freedom of word order. In the other camp
                     are researchers who support a configurational approach in which noun phrases
                     are themselves arguments coindexed with agreement morphology on the
                     predicate (e.g. Gardiner 1993, H. Davis 1999). I assume the latter analysis in this
                     work, although neither theoretical approach is crucial to the descriptive goals
                     pursued here.","[106, 107]"

                     NPs is reversed.     In (54) the direct object ttw’it ‘boy’ appears immediately
                      following the predicate and the subject kiy’dna? ‘girl’ is in final position. This
                     represents the unmarked word order VOS.             In (55) the same subject appears
                      adjacent to the predicate and the direct object is in final position.        This VSO
                      ordering is not as frequent as VOS, but is possible nonetheless.
                              One might think that such variations on word order would lead to
                      ambiguity, but this is not the case. The particle wa, which surfaces in both (54)
                      and (55), serves as a disambiguating device.             Czaykowska-Higgins (1996,
                      1998:160) and Willett (1996) analyze this particle as a third person absolutive
                      marker which surfaces with 3rd person transitive objects and 3rd person
                      intransitive subjects.   In both (54) and (55) it precedes ttw’it ‘boy’ making it clear
                      that ttw’it is the object in these constructions.         I address the particle wa in detail
                      in section 5.6.
                              Unmarked intransitive word order is VS, as shown in (56) to (57):

                             Nxa?amxcin is certainly a possible candidate as a noun incorporating
                     language within Baker’s (1996) model since it has both features Baker claims are
                     common to all noun incorporating languages.           First, Nxa?amxcin is a head-
                     marking language as all direct arguments have morphological representation on
                     the verb.   This property is evident in the following examples where both the

                              Baker also claims that noun incorporating languages are
                     nonconfigurational26 in that NPs representing direct arguments are not
                     constrained to one position in a clause since they surface as adjuncts.             Hence,
                     they should exhibit some freedom of word order. This is certainly true of
                     Nxa?amxcin which can have the following combinations, even though VOS
                     appears to be the unmarked order in the language:

                               In this chapter I presented a brief introduction to the syntax of
                     Nxa?amxcin. | first outlined the parts of speech, touching briefly on the
                      controversy surrounding lexical categories in Salish languages where some
                      scholars recognize a noun-verb distinction while others do not.            Adopting the
                     views of the former, I then moved on to a discussion of the noun phrase.                I
                     introduced the four determiners and three demonstratives that have been
                     identified for Nxa?amxcin, and then looked at oblique and locative prepositions.
                     In the final section on noun phrases, I reviewed the syntax of genitive phrases.
                               I then turned to the syntax of various types of clauses. I illustrated that
                      simple clauses have VS word order for intransitive, and the unmarked VOS for
                     transitive clauses, noting that there is some freedom of word order as VSO
                      constructions are also possible.     Relative clauses were examined with the data
                     illustrating that the relative clause head could either precede or follow the relative
                     clause.    In addition, relative clauses can be headless in Nxa?amxcin.             I then
                     looked at fronting constructions which involve the fronting of a NP/PP to pre-
                     predicate position. There are three types of fronting:         (i) unmarked; (ii) quasi-
                     clefting (the fronted argument is followed by a subordinating particle and the
                     residue has the surface form of a relative clause as it is preceded by an oblique
                     marker); and (iii) clefting (identical in structure to quasi-clefting except there is a
                     deteminer in lieu of a subordinating particle).
                               Finally, I looked at the properties and distribution of the particle wa, which
                     is prevalent throughout the Nxa?amxcin data.            On the surface it appears to mark
                     (optionally) absolutive arguments; however it is linked with the transitive subject
                     in topical object constructions.     Its position in fronting constructions is curious in
                     that when absolutive arguments (or subjects of topical object constructions) are
                     fronted, wa appears to mark the residue as opposed to the fronted NP.
                               Having looked at how Nxa?amxcin clause constructions are formed, in the

                             With respect to the morphological structure in (2), Czaykowska-Higgins
                     presents arguments to support her analysis of a morphological root, stem and
                      word level.   She claims that the morphological root can be isolated as an
                      independent level based on the fact that certain affixes target the root only.         In
                      addition to the morphological root, Czaykowska-Higgins argues for the existence
                      of two more constituents:       the morphological stem and the morphological word.
                      She claims (1998:171) that the morphological stem “consists of all morphology
                      which is not relevant to the syntax and which represents the lexical content of a
                      Columbian word”.       The morphological stem contains the locative prefixes,
                      reduplicative affixes, primary affixes, and the nonreferential uses of lexical
                      suffixes.   Czaykowska-Higgins considers all of these morphemes to be lexical,
                      stating (1998:159-160) that “[l]exical morphemes are those which are not in any
                      way directly relevant to the syntax; this class includes some morphology that is
                      often referred to as derivational”.     The morphological word, on the other hand,
                      contains morphemes that are of syntactic relevance.           These include the aspectual
                      affixes, object and subject markers, transitive and intransitive suffixes, and the
                      referential uses of lexical suffixes.
                              The division between the morphological stem and the morphological word
                      marks a contrast between two separate uses of lexical suffixes:           nonreferential
                      and referential respectively.     For the first type, which appears inside the
                      morphological stem domain, the lexical suffixes “play no role in the syntax but
                      instead serve to specify or extend the lexical meaning of the Root to which they
                      are affixed” (1998:164).     The referential lexical suffixes, which appear outside the
                      morphological stem, are considered to “function as morphosyntactic objects” in
                      that they “seem to satisfy an internal argument of the root and to have meanings
                      which are fairly concrete or referential” (1998:164).
                              Czaykowska-Higgins points out that the two functions of lexical suffixes
                      suggest that a lexical vs. grammatical (or morphosyntactic) distinction may be
                      more relevant in an analysis of the morphological structure of Nxa?amxcin

                     between lexical and grammatical/morphosyntactic morphemes in word formation
                      marks the boundary between the morphological stem and the morphological
                      word in the structure in (2). Czaykowska-Higgins defines morphosyntactic and
                      lexical morphemes as follows:
                      (3)     Morphosyntactic morphemes
                                     are relevant to the syntax; that is, they
                                             i.     exhibit inflectional (configurational, agreement,
                                                    inherent, or phrasal) properties
                                     or      il.    reflect the syntactic frame or argument structure of a
                                                      stem
                              Lexical morphemes
                                     change or extend the lexical meaning of a stem
                                                                                Czaykowska-Higgins       1998:159
                      Czaykowska-Higgins makes it clear that her use of the term “morphosyntactic”
                      has much broader scope than that of “inflectional”.          She writes (1998:159),
                      “[t]he morphosyntactic category as I am defining it includes morphemes that
                      reflect what are traditionally considered to be inflectional properties such as case,
                      number, gender, and aspect, but also includes morphemes that play some part in
                      determining or reflecting the syntactic frame or the argument structure of a Root.
                      In other words any entity that plays a role in the syntax is morphosyntactic,
                      whether that role is inflectional or functional”.       In effect, Czaykowska-Higgins
                      argues that a derivational-inflectional distinction like that defined in Anderson
                      1982, 1988 cannot account for the dual behaviour of the lexical suffixes, thus, a
                      lexical-grammatical distinction has more explanatory value in this case.5
                              4Czaykowska-Higgins notes that the order of morphemes also supports a
                      lexical vs. grammatical/morphosyntactic distinction.
                              5Rice (2000) also takes an alternate view in her morphological analysis of
                      Athapaskan verbs. Instead of a derivational vs. inflectional distinction, Rice
                      distinguishes between lexical items and functional items. The former covers items
                      that are usually labelled derivational, while the latter includes some items that
                      have been considered derivational and others that have been viewed as
                      inflectional.","[41, 42, 43]"

                             Czaykowska-Higgins highlights two implications of her analysis for a
                     theory of grammar.      First, the results of her investigation into morpheme
                     boundaries in Nxa?amxcin suggest that “the salient distinction in Columbian is
                     not between derivation and inflection [...], but is rather a distinction between
                     lexical and grammatical—{...] morphosyntactic—word formation” (1998:154).
                      Second, the fact that the phonological and morphological domains are not
                      isomorphic, as can be seen in (1) and (2), “presents clear evidence that
                     morphology and phonology are not ordered in the same component of grammar”
                      (1998:154).
                              The remainder of this chapter focuses primarily on the morphological
                      domains found in Nxa?amxcin word formation with a brief look at the
                     phonological status of the root.      In the following section I propose an analysis of
                      morphological domains that differs from the one proposed by Czaykowska-
                      Higgins in (2). I adopt, however, Czaykowska-Higgins’ claim that the root is the
                      primary level of phonological structure in Nxa?amxcin.            My analysis supports
                      Czaykowska-Higgins’ claim that the phonological and morphological domains in
                     Nxaramxcin are not isomorphic.","[43, 44]"

                      8.1 What is a Compound?
                            Anderson (1992:292) defines a compound as “the combination of (two or
                      more) existing words into a new word”. Such a process, he claims, contrasts with
                      derivation and inflection which involve “the application of a Word Formation
                      Rule to a single existing word”.      A word formation rule, Anderson states,
                      “operates on a single word (or stem) to manipulate its phonological form
                      (typically, but not exclusively, by affixation) as well as its other properties.
                     Compounding, in contrast, involves the combining of stems from the lexicon into
                     a quasi-syntactic structure.”
                             While compound structures have been widely noted throughout the cross-
                     linguistic literature, the theoretical literature on compounds is relatively limited.
                     Fabb (1998:82), in his general overview of compounding, indicates that “{t]his is
                     because compounds tend to be less phonologically or morphologically active
                     than derived words, and less syntactically active than phrases: compounds are
                     relatively inert”.   The major theoretical work on compounds can be attributed to

                      DiSciullo and Williams (1987) and Anderson (1992), among others. For the
                      purposes of this work, I adopt Anderson’s (1992) analysis which is in line with
                      Selkirk’s (1982) work on compounds.!
                                Selkirk recognizes an “apparent need for particular rule statements; a
                      general X’ schema for compounding does not adequately characterize the
                      compounding possibilities found in English” (p.13). Anderson claims that
                      compounds are created by a set of word structure rules which “have much the
                      same form as phrase-structure rules, but apply only to lexical categories. Word
                      Structure Rules operate to specify the internal constituency of lexical categories
                      and (optionally) their heads” (p.299). Both Anderson and Selkirk agree that
                      these rules must be specific enough so as to rule out any gaps present in the
                      compounds of a language. Possible stem combinations as well as the feature of
                      “headedness” are very much language-specific, therefore what is available in the
                      grammar of a particular language should be encoded in its word structure rules.
                      For example, a compound of the lexical category verb comprising a verb stem and
                      a noun stem would be realized by the following Word Structure Rule:
                      dg)    VoOVN
                     The word structure rule in (1) indicates that a verb stem and a noun stem can
                     combine to form a single lexical item of the category verb. The head of the
                     compound is underlined.
                             The semantic interpretation of a compound is closely tied with the concept
                     of head.     As Selkirk (p.22) points out, “the nonhead constituent of the compound
                     in some way further defines the head; [...] the head is, intuitively speaking, the
                     nucleus of the compound”. For example, a nonhead can fill a role in the
                     argument structure of a head, but not the other way around.            Selkirk (p.22) notes,
                             1I should clarify that while Anderson’s view of compounding finds root in
                     Selkirk’s work on word structure, their views on derivation and inflection are
                     radically different in that Selkirk takes a morpheme-based approach to word
                     formation while Anderson adopts a lexeme-based view.","[349, 350]"

                     5.2.4   Genitives
                             Nouns with overt nominal possessors are marked for possession by the
                     genitive marker J, although N. Mattina (2002:266-—67) indicates that genitive
                     marking in Nxa?amxcin is optional. There is some variation of word order
                     possible with the genitive marker, when present, “attaching either to the right or
                     left of the possessor within the scope of the article” (N. Mattina 2002:267).           The
                     following combinations are possible:
                     (46)    Possessor       GN                 Possessum

                      The biclausal example in (101) appears in the active voice. Mary is topic, and
                      because the topic fills the agentive role in both clauses, the unmarked active
                      voice is maintained and Mary is coindexed with the third person subject suffix -s.
                      In example (102), Mary is again topic; however Mary is assigned the agent role in
                      the initial clause and the patient role in the second clause. In order to clarify that
                      it is Mary and not the dog that has been bitten, topical object voice is employed
                      in the second clause signalling that the topic (Mary) has been assigned the role of
                     patient. Thus, when the topic maintains an agent role, as in (101), the neutral
                     (unmarked) active voice is used. When the original agent topic is assigned a
                     patient role, as in (102), the predicate is marked for topical object voice. Some
                     more examples are given below:

                     8.4.4.1.1 Mithun’s Analysis of Noun Incorporation
                             The broad use of the term noun incorporation is best illustrated in Mithun
                      1984, who writes that “NI apparently arises as part of a general tendency in
                     language for V’s to coalesce with their non-referential objects” (p.891).            She
                     distinguishes four separate types of noun incorporation each with a different
                     function.   She claims (p.891) that in Type I noun incorporation, “the NI reflects a
                     reduction of [the object’s] individual salience within predicates”.          Type II NI is
                     used to “background arguments within clauses”.             Type III NI is used “as a
                     device for backgrounding old or incidental information within discourse”.              And
                     finally, Type IV NI has become a classificatory system in which “generic N’s are

                             Mithun’s first noun incorporation type is labelled lexical compounding.
                     She writes (p.848):
                             If a language exhibits any NI at all, it will contain basic lexical compounds.
                             Structurally, compounding consists of the derivation of a complex lexical
                             item from a combination of two or more stems. The constituent stems may
                             be of almost any grammatical class (nouns, verbs, adjectives etc.), as may
                             the resulting compound. [...] The term ‘incorporation’ is generally used to
                             refer to a particular type of compounding in which a V and N combine to
                             form a new V. The N bears a specific semantic relationship to its host V - as
                             patient, location, or instrument.
                     Mithun comments on the inefficiency of allowing for identical expressions in a
                     language, and argues that languages incorporate nouns for a reason.                 With
                     respect to /exical compounding, Mithun (p.848—9) claims that “[s]ome entity,
                     quality, or activity is recognized sufficiently to be considered name-worthy in its
                     own right [...] The activity or quality designated by the NV compound is viewed
                     as a recognizable, unitary concept, rather than the chance co-occurrence of some
                     action or state and some entity”.       The noun in such a compound is non-specific
                     (i.e. non-referential) and, as a result, is not marked for the categories of
                     definiteness and number.         Mithun notes that the NV compound may be written as
                     separate words, as in the following examples from Kanjobal (Mayan) and Lahu

"                      6.2.1.1    Topical Object
                                Topical object constructions in Salish were first labelled and defined by
                      Kinkade (1989a, 1990b), who provides a pan-Salish discussion of this
                      operation.18 He defines (1990b:343) the topical object construction as follows:
                                The main function of the topical object as contrasted with the plain (often
                                zero) third-person object is to keep track of a topic in a section of
                                discourse when there is more than one third-person referent present and
                                the one that is topic has been shifted into a patient role and designated by
                                a pronominal object marker. In order to maintain its topicality, it is
                                specially marked.
                                Topical object voice constructions resemble inverse voice constructions
                      with respect to relative topicality.     Givén (2001:155) writes that “inverse voice
                      constructions are used in discourse contexts when the patient outranks the agent
                      in topicality, thus contrasting with the agent-topicalizing active-direct; but the
                      agent-of-inverse remains topical, thus contrasting with the radically suppressed
                      agent-of-passive”.     In line with inverse constructions, the specific function of
                      topical object voice appears to be signalling that the patient is topic.           Unlike
                      passive voice, the agent still holds some degree of topicality. Following Givén’s
                      schema in (94), we can represent the relative topicality of agent and patient in
                      topical object voice as follows:
                             18Kinkade identifies Nxa?amxcin, Upper Chehalis, Cowlitz, Quinault,
                      Tillamook and Lushootseed as having topical object constructions. See H. Davis
                      (1994) for analysis of a cognate in Lillooet.",[160]

                             Doubling is a well-noted property of incorporating languages although, as
                     Baker notes, it is not found in all incorporating languages.         Mohawk does exhibit
                     doubling of an incorporated noun, and Baker gives the following as an example:
                     (201)   Uwari [[vp a-ye-naktj-a-nthwe’-ne’              t; |    [nei ne Sak rao-nakt-a’]]
                             Mary       FUT-FsS-bed-9-like-PUNC                            ne Sak Msp-bed-NSF
                             Mary likes Sak’s bed.
                                                                                                  Baker 1996:311
                     In (201) the incorporated noun nakt ‘bed’ is doubled with a phonologically
                     identical independent NP.        Baker (1996) argues that this NP is not in any
                     argument position but rather surfaces in an adjunct position coindexed with the
                     trace of the incorporated noun.
                             Czaykowska-Higgins, Willett and Bart (1996) claim that direct doubling is
                     not possible in lexical suffix constructions in Nxa?amxcin.           This is illustrated by
                     the following example:
                     (202)   * c-k”an=a?st-nt-n                      xh7ut
                               DIR-grab=rock-TR-(3AB)-lsS_           rock
                                 (I took the rock.)                                              CW&B      1996:33
                     The example in (202), which contains both the bound stem =a?st ‘rock’ and the
                     independent noun x’’ut ‘rock’ in the role of theme, was rejected on grounds of                     ungrammaticality.
                             In order for a NP to cooccur with a bound stem satisfying the same
                     argument role, the NP must be marked oblique, as shown in the following
                     examples:
                     (203)   Mary  tumistatx”                t       stox*tox*ul

                             Mary sells houses.                                                   CW&B     1996:11

                     In (203) both the lexical suffix =atx” ‘house’ and the independent noun
                     stax”tox™il ‘houses’ appear in the same clause filling the same argument role.
                     However, stox”tox”il must be marked oblique by the particle t. Otherwise the
                     construction in ungrammatical. The same is true for example (204) which
                     contains the lexical suffix =atp ‘tree’ and the noun c’aq’atps ‘his fir tree’. In
                     order for c’aq’dtps to appear in this construction it must be marked oblique.
                             The contrast in doubling facts between Nxa?amxcin bound stems and
                     Mohawk incorporated nouns suggests that the syntactic structures of the clauses
                      in these two languages are different.","[420, 421, 422]"

                      further insight into indefinite object voice constructions.        Clearly, however, they
                      play a role in the elaborate voice system found in Nxa?amxcin.
                                The properties of indefinite object voice are summarized below:

                      6.2.2     Semantic Voice
                                Coming under a different sub-domain within the category voice is
                      semantic voice.     While examining instances of pragmatic voice in the previous
                      four sections, it was necessary to look beyond the single clause construction in
                      order to understand the essential functions of the various types of pragmatic
                      voice.    This is not the case with semantic voice operations since their primary
                      functions are not dependent on discourse factors.
                             According to Givén (2001:93), semantic voice operations tamper with the
                      three central properties of a prototypical transitive construction: (i) While
                      prototypical transitive constructions contain a “volitional, controlling, active,
                      intiating agent responsible for the event”, operations of semantic voice result in
                      “decreased agentivity of the agent/subject”.         (ii) The patient in a prototypical
                      transitive construction “involves a non-volitional, inactive, non-controlling

                             significance but used only in combination with other stems or elements of
                             words and usually unrelated in form to the independent words of the same
                             significance, furnish apparent instances of incorporation, in that they are
                             sometimes used as objects of verb stems with which they are combined.
                             They are however also employed subjectively and adverbially, and are
                             therefore more than incorporated nouns. The essential nature and function
                             of these elements is still obscure, and until they become better understood
                             they also can furnish no proof of objective noun-incorporation.
                                                                                   A. Kroeber 1909:572-3                              ... it is clear that verbal affixes that refer to nouns, in other words, convey a
                              substantival idea, are not instances of noun incorporation if they are
                             etymologically unrelated to the independent nouns or noun stems with
                             which they seem logically connected. Such affixes are generally either
                             instrumental (Siouan, Shoshonean) or local (Kwakiutl, Salish) in character,
                             but may also be employed to represent the logical object or even, in the
                             case of intransitive verbs, subject (this use is characteristic of Kwakiutl,
                             Chemakum, and Salish). As long, however, as they are lexically distinct
                             from noun stems proper, they must be looked upon as grammatical
                             elements pure and simple, however concrete their signification may seem.
                             They are logically related to independent nouns of the same or allied
                             meaning as are tense affixes to independent adverbs of time.
                                                                                             Sapir 1911:251-2
                              The main reason lexical affixes have not fit neatly into any specific cross-
                      linguistic category is due to their dual or ‘split’? behaviour.     As Egesdal (1981)
                     points out, lexical information is generally associated with stems and grammatical
                      information with affixes. In Salish, he claims, we have an affix that carries lexical
                      information.    Egesdal also notes the lack of etymological relationship between the
                      lexical affixes and their independent forms; bound stems generally bear no
                     resemblance whatsoever to their overt NP counterpart(s).            The following forms
                     illustrate that this is clearly the case for Nxa?amxcin:
                     (150)                           Bound Stem                      Independent Noun

                     resemblance to their corresponding independent forms in the righthand column.
                      In fact, the bound stems in (150) cannot even be interpreted as reduced forms of
                     the independent nouns.       This is an observation that has been noted consistently
                     throughout the Salish literature.      Egesdal surmises that the fact that these affixes
                      are seemingly archaic morphemes within the family has deterred many Salishanists
                      from making any speculative claims as to their origin.
                              Following A. Kroeber’s and Sapir’s reference to Salish “substantival”
                      suffixes, there was relatively little work published on these affixes—outside of
                     Reichard 1938 and Vogt 1940—auntil the sixties and seventies when research on
                      a variety of different Salish languages surfaced.       Most of this work was largely
                      descriptive, resulting in a larger amount of data made available for future research.
                     This includes works such as Pidgeon’s (1970) description of lexical suffixes in
                      Saanich, Haeberlin’s (1974) previous description of pan-Salish lexical suffixes
                      edited by M.T. Thompson, and Saunders and Davis’ (1975a) discussion of Bella
                     Coola.    Newman (1968) and Kinkade (1973) both presented papers at the
                     International Conference on Salish Languages|4, Newman’s work a
                     comparative look at lexical suffixes across the Salish family and Kinkade’s
                     devoted to lexical suffixes in Nxa?amxcin.         Discussion of lexical suffixes also
                     appeared in various grammars during this time period, such as Harris 1963;
                     Kuipers 1967, 1974; and Leslie 1979; among others. In 1987, A. Mattina
                     presented a paper at the 26th Conference on American Indian Languages which
                     was a comparative study of lexical suffixes and lexical prefixes across the Salish
                     family.
                            Works by Gerdts and Hinkson (1996) and Mithun (1997) have focused on
                     the diachronic development of lexical affixes. Gerdts and Hinkson (p.164)
                     propose that “lexical suffixes are the final stage of a process whereby a free noun
                     becomes increasingly fused to an element with which it is compounded until it
                     emerges as a bound form.       Other functionally similar processes—noun stripping
                     (Miner 1986) and noun incorporation (Mithun 1984)—<can be considered stages

                                                              Conclusion
                             This dissertation has been a synchronic investigation of the grammar of
                     Nxa?amxcin.       This investigation took place within the context of Beard’s (1995)
                     theory of Lexeme-Morpheme Base Morphology (LMBM), a lexeme-based
                      approach to word formation.   This theory was outlined in Chapter 2, and
                      although this has not been a theory-centred work, the LMBM approach has been
                      a useful tool in my attempts to understand and explain how Nxa?amxcin words,
                      known for their complexity, are put together.         In Chapter 3 I presented an
                      analysis of levels of word structure in Nxa?amxcin, arguing that it is the lexeme
                      that constitutes the primary level of word structure from a morphological
                      perspective while the root is the primary level from a phonological perspective.
                              The grammatical sketch itself began with Chapter 4, where I presented an
                      introduction to the phonology of Nxa?amxcin. I outlined Nxa?amxcin’s
                      segmental inventory and the various sources of schwa, discussed various
                      segmental processes—tetraction, vowel deletion, consonant deletion,
                      degemination, vocalization and affrication—and presented the major points
                      regarding Nxa?amxcin syllable structure and stress.
                              Chapter 5 provided an overview of Nxa?amxcin syntax.               I first addressed
                      the controversial issue of lexical categories in Salish and adopted the analysis that
                      verbs, nouns and adjectives are distinct lexical categories in Nxa?amxcin but any
                      one of these three can serve a predicative function at the level of syntax.          I then
                      looked at various aspects of the Nxa?amxcin noun phrase:              determiners and
                      demonstratives, oblique and locative prepositions, and genitive marking.             I began
                      my discussion of Nxa?amxcin clause structure with simple clauses and then
                      moved on to the more complex structures of relative clauses, unmarked fronting,
                      quasi-clefting and clefting.     I also presented details on the distribution of the
                      particle wa which is linked to absolutive arguments in active constructions and to
                      the transitive subject in topical object constructions.","[427, 428]"

                              Topicality pertains to nominal participants (‘referents’; most commonly
                              subjects or objects) of clauses. The propositional information coded in
                              state/event clauses is typically about some topical participant(s) in the
                              state/event. Such topical participants are most commonly the subject,
                              direct-object or indirect-object of the clause, and thus most commonly
                              noun phrases (‘entities’) rather than verbs (‘events’) or adjectives
                              (‘states’) [...] In spite of being grammatically manifest at the clause level,
                              topicality is not a clause-level property of referents, but rather a discourse-
                              dependent one. This is often masked by the fact that one can examine a
                              well-coded clause out of context, and observe all the grammatical devices
                              that mark participants as referring, topical definite etc. But such isolated
                              clauses are only artifacts. What makes their participants topical is not the
                              fact that they are grammatically coded as topical (subject, object) in the
                              self-contained clause. Rather, they are so coded grammatically because
                              they are topical across a certain span of multi-propositional discourse.
                              Their topicality is thus due to their being recurrent referents in some larger
                              discourse.
                              Givon (1994, 2001) identifies the major pragmatic voice operations as
                      inverse, passive and antipassive, and he defines these in relation to the unmarked
                      active voice in which “both the agent and the patient are topical, but the agent is
                      more topical than the patient” (2001:94).        Givén schematizes the relative
                      topicality of the agent and patient roles for active, inverse, passive and
                      antipassive voice as follows:
                      (94)    Relative topicality of the agent and patient in the four main voices:
                                Voice                          Relative topicality
                                active/direct                 AGT > PAT
                                inverse                      AGT < PAT
                                passive                      AGT <<     PAT
                                antipassive                  AGT >>     PAT                                                                                                     Givon 1994:8
                     As (94) indicates, the agent in inverse constructions is less topical than the
                     patient, the exact reverse of the active voice.       In passive constructions, the patient

                                In the following subsections I describe four different voice operations in
                      Nxa?amxcin that can be subsumed under the heading pragmatic voice.                    The first
                      is the topical object construction, which shares properties with the inverse in the
                      schema in (94).     The second and third are the passive and antipassive, both cross-
                      linguistically common voice operations.        The fourth, indefinite object voice,
                      appears to be less cross-linguistically common.","[158, 159, 160]"

                     In the Kanjobal example in (186b), we see that the predicate ‘eat’ and the noun
                     ‘bread’ appear as independent words, as in (186a).           Mithun (p.852) notes,
                     however, that “[a]lthough they remain separate words, the V and the
                     incorporated noun (IN) form a syntactic unit equivalent to an intransitive V; this is
                     evident from the pronominal affixes within the V. Agents of transitive V’s appear
                     in the ergative case [...] Agents of intransitives appear in the absolutive”.        The
                     predicate ‘eat’ in (186b) is marked for a subject in absolutive case indicating that
                     the noun ‘bread’ is not an independent object.          The Lahu example in (187b)
                     contains the predicate ‘drink’ preceded by the noun ‘liquor’. The noun is not
                     marked accusative, as in (187a), and Mithun (p.853) notes that “[i]t qualifies the
                     type of drinking discussed”.
                             In other languages the noun and verb stem of lexical compounds combine
                     morphologically to form a single complex word.            Some examples are given below

                     features all function together as a unit, and this unit is identified with a particular
                     concept.       This is illustrated in the following examples for bake and -er
                     respectively:

                     The phonological, grammatical and semantic features of the morphemes bake and
                     -er are given in (la) and (1b) respectively.            The brackets show that these features
                     form an indivisible set, and it is this group of features as a whole that constitutes
                     the linguistic sign.
                              The final major assumption of a morpheme-based approach to word
                     formation is that all morphemes are stored in the lexicon.            Since it was stated
                     above that both affixes and free forms are morphemes, it follows that both affixes
                     and free forms are stored in the lexicon. Thus, each of the morphemes bake and
                     -er would have their own entry in the lexicon.
                              The main point to be emphasized in this discussion is that free forms like
                     bake and affixes like -er have essentially the same status in a morpheme-based
                     model.        Both are morphemes, both are linguistic signs, and both originate in the
                     lexicon. In word formation there is only one kind of item, the morpheme, which is
                     stored in one place, the lexicon.      Thus, whether it is an independent stem like
                     bake or a bound affix like -er, both are signs and both are stored in the same
                     component.
                              Before moving on to a discussion of Lexeme-Morpheme Base
                     Morphology, it would be useful for the sake of comparison to give a visual
                     illustration of word formation within a morpheme-based theory.               Lieber (1992)
                     provides an excellent example as she clearly adopts all three of the above
                     assumptions.        Lieber (p.21) claims that “syntax and morphology are not separate

                     where words and sentences respectively are derived, or in the sense of being two
                     (at least partially) distinct sets of principles (Sproat 1985; Baker 1988[a])”.
                     Instead, she claims that both words and sentences can be formed within a single
                     modular framework with the appropriate principles. The formation of words can
                     be accounted for (with some modifications) within the X-bar framework proposed
                     for the formation of clauses by Jackendoff (1977), Chomsky (1981) and Stowell
                     (1981).    The position of a word’s head within this X-bar framework depends on
                     the parameter selected by a particular language (see Lieber 1992, chapter 3). X-
                     bar theory provides the modular framework for word formation, but it is not
                     enough as Lieber (p.77) states:
                               [...] X-bar theory alone cannot account for everything that is relevant in
                               the construction of complex words. X-bar theory determines the position
                               of the head in words and sentences, but it says nothing about the actual
                               mechanism that effects labeling of nodes within words, that is, the process
                               by which categorial information and other features are projected up from
                               lexical entries to produce fully labeled word structures.
                     In order for the appropriate features to be passed on from one node to another
                     within the X-bar framework, Lieber proposes two distinct processes.                 The first,
                     which is the one of most interest in this discussion, is feature percolation.              This
                     process allows for the morphosytntactic features of the head to “percolate” up to
                     the dominant node.      The second process, which I do not address here, is
                     inheritance, which ensures that argument structures are passed on from one node
                     to another.
                               This condensed discussion of Lieber 1992 should provide enough
                     background to explain how a word like bakers is formed within this morpheme-
                     based framework.      In line with the major assumptions of a morpheme-based
                     theory outlined above, Lieber assumes that the forms bake, -er and -s are all
                     morphemes and that they all constitute linguistic signs, as indicated in (1). In
                     addition, each of these forms has its own entry in the lexicon.          Since all of these
                     are considered to be signs, and signs are comprised of indivisible features, all
                     idiosyncratic phonological, grammatical and semantic features are part of this
                     entry.","[21, 22, 23]"

                     positions, hence the fact that all polysynthetic languages show pro-drop for both
                     subject and direct object.                     Any overt NPs must surface as adjuncts coindexed

                     While example (197) may appear to be an optional alternative, Baker claims that
                     noun incorporation in (197) is obligatory. It is required in this example because,

                                                                                                          406                     unlike example (195), the head nakt ‘bed’ is generated under N in the V
                     complement position. If object morphology is present on the verb it will absorb
                     the case-feature for that position and, as a result, nakt ‘bed’ cannot be licensed.
                     If object morphology is absent from the verb, as Baker argues it is in (197), then
                     nakt is not coindexed with any morpheme in the verb and therefore violates the
                     MVC.     However, if the head nakt incorporates into the verb via head movement
                     (Travis 1984), then the trace of nakt in the direct object position is coindexed
                     with a morpheme in the verb and passes the MVC.
                             Thus, while Mithun (1984) (as well as Mithun and Corbett (1999)) claims
                     that the N+V form in an example like (197) is functionally motivated, Baker
                     (1996) claims such forms are syntactically required. In more specific terms, noun
                     incorporation is a direct result of the Polysynthesis Parameter (or Morphological
                      Visibility Condition) which Baker claims is operative in true polysynthetic
                      languages like Nahuatl (Uto-Aztecan), Rembarrnga (Gunwinyguan),
                     Nunggubuyu (Australian, non-Pama-Nyungan), Mayali (Australian), Chukchi
                      (Chukchi-Kamchatkan), Wichita (Caddoan), and languages of the Iroquoian and
                      Tanoan families.
                             Baker presents a very clear analysis of the syntactic operation involved in
                     NI formation.     He also gives a detailed discussion of the properties one would
                      expect to find in such constructions and the relevent tests to determine whether
                      or not a syntactic process has taken place. As a result, I will focus specifically on
                      Baker’s work here and use his findings and examples as tools for comparison
                     with the Nxa?amxcin data. Use of the term noun incorporation is henceforth
                      strictly in the spirit of Baker.","[417, 418, 419]"

                     phonological representations of the lexemes if these additional segments are
                      included in the lexical entry. Again, a lexemic stem level (as opposed to root stem
                     level) is required in order to account for these forms in Nxa?amxcin word
                      structure.","[50, 51]"

                     more akin to that of ‘re-’ or ‘back’ in English (e.g. ‘redo’, ‘hit back’). Paul
                     Kroeber (p.c.) also considers a reversative gloss to be appropriate.

                      In the structures in (1) and (2) there are three separate domains: a root domain, a
                      stem domain, and a word domain.          With respect to the phonological structure in
                      (1), the root domain includes root and the -C2 and -C,; VC2 reduplicative suffixes.2
                      The phonological stem contains the phonological root and all remaining suffixes,
                      and the phonological word contains the phonological stem and all prefixes.              The
                      morphological domains in (2) are not isomorphic with the phonological domains
                      in (1). The morphological root is comprised of just the root. The morphological
                      stem domain encompasses locative prefixes, reduplicative affixes, the
                      morphological root, primary affixes3 and some uses of lexical suffixes. The
                      morphological word includes the morphological stem and the remaining affixes.
                      (Note that the transitive, object and subject suffixes are in complementary
                      distribution with the intransitive and aspectual suffixes.)
                              I discuss Czaykowska-Higgins’ arguments for her divisions in both the
                      phonological and morphological structures below.           While it is the latter that is of
                      primary interest in this work, I include a discussion of Czaykowska-Higgins’
                              2Czaykowska-Higgins refers to the C2-reduplicative morpheme (i.e. the
                      ‘out-of-control’ marker) as a suffix, although it is analyzed as an infix operating
                      from the left edge of the root in Willett and Czaykowska-Higgins 1995 and
                      Czaykowska-Higgins and Willett 1997. I make the latter assumption in section
                      6.4.1.
                              3The term primary affixes refers to the morphemes marking the inchoative,
                      stative and autonomous (referred to as middle voice in this work) categories.","[39, 40]"

                                                                                                         91.109
                              If morphological spelling operations are ordered in Nxa?amxcin, the
                      examples in (13) to (16) pose a problem since the apparent relational and
                      applicative suffixes are not in their usual position.       One cannot assume that the
                      suffixes -min, -xit, -tu#t, and -m have been synchronically fused with the stems
                      kalx, taw and wak” in (13) to (16) as these stems generally occur without these
                      suffixes. In addition, -min, -xit and -tutt are clearly not marking grammatical
                      features in (13) to (15). (As for (16), it is often difficult to determine what function
                      is associated with the suffix -m.) The relational marker -min always precedes a
                      valence-changing marker creating bivalent stems (e.g. transitive, causative), yet
                      no such marker is present in (13). The applicative suffix -xit marks a valence-
                      changing operation creating bivalent stems, yet the predicate in (14) is
                      intransitive.   The applicative suffix -tutt never cooccurs with the transitive marker
                      -nt as -tutt itself marks an operation creating bivalent stems, yet both -tutt and -nt
                      cooccur in (15).
                              Given that the suffixes -min, -xit, -tu#t, and -m usually surface to the right
                      of bound stems, and that the first three do not appear to have any active function
                      in (13) to (15), I assume the stems kalxmin, tawxit, wak“tutt, and wak™m in (13)
                      to (16) are lexemic stems.14
                              While I have argued for a lexemic stem as opposed to a root stem as the
                      primary level of morphological structure in Nxa?amxcin, the concept of the root                              14The idea that for a given lexeme more than one stem may be available for
                      word formation has been proposed by Aronoff (1992, 1994). He illustrates that
                      the Latin future active participle is formed on the stem of the perfect (passive)
                      participle as opposed to the verb root.","[52, 53]"

                     the present work, it is important to note that there are many stages involved in the
                     process of an independent noun becoming a bound element.                For example,
                     several diachronic lexical suffixes in Nxa?amxcin (i.e. the agentive nominalizer
                      sx*s- and the instrumental nominalizers -min and -tn) are now strictly markers of
                     grammatical operations. The classifier system discussed in section 8.3.5 is also
                     representative of a stage in the diachronic history of bound stems in Nxa?amxcin
                     and Salish in general. In my discussion of bound stems here, I am strictly focusing
                     on one stage. At this stage these bound stems appear to have maintained lexemic
                      status in that they represent elements of various lexical categories; their semantics,
                     though extended, remains much narrower than those of the classifiers; and they
                      do not mark grammatical operations (unlike the agentive and instrumental
                     nominalizers).     The lexical suffixes that I address here reflect what Czaykowska-
                     Higgins (1996, 1998) refers to as referential and nonreferential lexical suffixes,
                     what Czaykowska-Higgins, Willett and Bart (1996) refer to as Root+Lexical
                     Suffix Compounds and Root+Lexical Suffix Predicates, and what Gerdts and
                     Hinkson (1996) refer to as compounding noun incorporation.
                             Basically, two different views have emerged as to the nature of these
                     lexical affix constructions:     (i) they are a syntactic phenomenon involving the
                     combination of stems at the level of syntax; (ii) they are a process of
                     compounding (which I assume here to be a lexical phenomenon).                The main
                     proponents of view (i) are Davis and Saunders (1973) and Saunders and Davis
                     (1975a,b,c).     In their works throughout the seventies, Saunders and Davis support
                     a syntactic approach to lexical suffixation in Bella Coola.          They claim that “the
                     affixation of “lexical suffixes” [...] occurs in the syntactic component of the
                     grammar via a copying rule [...] called LEXICAL SUFFIX COPY” (1975b:356).
                     They note that “not all lexical items [...] have a corresponding lexical suffix, and
                     there appears to be no semantic criterion or feature of these lexical items which
                     differentiates them from those having an associated lexical suffix” (p.356).            In
                     order to account for this, Saunders and Davis propose a syntactic feature [+
                     Referential] which is arbitrarily assigned to lexical items. Those lexical items
                     marked [+ Referential] have a corresponding lexical suffix, while those marked [-

                     lexical items are subject to the optional application of LEXICAL SUFFIX
                     COPY”.     Under this rule, a copy of a lexical item is made.      This lexical item may
                     occupy the agent, patient or adjunct position in a clause.         The copy is in the form
                     of a phonologically distinct lexical suffix. Once the copy is made, the lexical item
                     is deleted by the rule REFERENT DELETION.
                              Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998) also claims that at least a subset of
                     lexical suffixes in Nxa?amxcin combine with stems at the level of syntax.               She
                     refers to these suffixes as “referential lexical suffixes” and states that they “take
                     on the role of Theme or Patient of the Root” and “they seem to satisfy an internal
                     argument of the root and to have meanings which are fairly concrete or
                     referential” (1998:164).     Her description of the referential lexical suffixes suggests
                     that these should be analyzed as incorporated nouns in the syntactic sense of
                     Baker (1988, 1996).      She writes that “referential Lexical Suffixes are units of the
                     syntactic structure, in addition to being units of the morphology.           In this sense
                     they function similarly to the subject and object markers which indicate the
                     person and number of the subject or object of a sentence” (1998:169).
                             A second view on the nature of lexical affixes is a compounding analysis.
                     I assume here such an analysis would entail that the combination of lexical affixes
                     with stems is a lexical process, since compounds are generally assumed to be
                     formed in the lexicon (e.g. Lieber 1983, 1992). An important point in favour of
                     the compounding analysis is the growing evidence in the literature that bound
                     stems are derived from free stem compounding in Salish. Egesdal (1981) was the
                     first to provide clear arguments for a compounding analysis of lexical suffixation
                     using data from a wide variety of Salish languages.         His major arguments are as
                     follows: First, the predicatet+lexical suffix combination is intransitive.          Second,
                     lexical suffixes cannot be pluralized and they cannot be modified by adjectives or
                     determiners.    Third, lexical suffixes have non-referential interpretations.        Fourth,
                     this non-referentiality explains why so many lexical suffix constructions become
                     lexicalized, as is often the case with compounds.         I return to Egesdal’s arguments
                     in section 8.4.3.","[392, 393, 394]"

                     Mithun (p.859) states that “Type II goes further than Type I [...] in having an
                     effect beyond the V itself. Instead of simply reducing the valence of the V by
                     one, it permits another argument of the clause to occupy the case role vacated by
                     the IN. The result is a lexical device for manipulating case relations within
                     clauses.”
                              Mithun’s Type III noun incorporation is referred to as the manipulation of
                     discourse structure and is “used to background known or incidental information
                     within portions of discourse”(p.859).           Mithun states that languages exhibiting
                     Type III noun incorporation are usually polysynthetic with subjects and objects
                     being obligatorily marked by pronominal affixes on predicates.              Mithun writes
                     (p.859):
                              In such languages, V’s - which carry most of the information - may of
                              course be qualified by N’s indicating the type of patient, instrument, or
                              location involved in the action or state. However, the qualifying N’s often
                              represent known or incidental information, rather than significant new
                              entities. A separate nominal constituent would sidetrack the attention of
                              the listener; the solution is NI. IN’s are not salient constituents in
                              themselves, whose presence might obstruct the flow of information. They
                              simply ride along with their host V’s.
                      Mithun provides the following examples from Huahtla Nahuatl (Uto-Aztecan)
                      and Koryak (Chukotko-Kamchatkan):24

                     8.4.4.1.2    Baker’s Syntactic Analysis of Noun Incorporation
                             Baker (1996, chapter 7) takes a much narrower view of noun
                     incorporation than Mithun, using the term noun incorporation specifically in
                     reference to a syntactic process whereby a N+V stem is formed via movement.             He
                     provides a number of syntactic and semantic tests as a guideline for
                     distinguishing between N+V combinations that are formed in the syntax and
                     those that are formed in the lexicon.
                             Baker claims that true noun incorporation is found in polysynthetic
                     languages—languages that are subject to the Morphological Visibility Condition
                     (MVC) (1996:286):                     (194)   Morphological Visibility Condition

                     3.1.1   Phonological Structure
                            Czaykowska-Higgins uses the facts surrounding both retraction and stress
                     assignment to determine the boundaries of phonological structure illustrated in
                      (1), claiming that three distinct constituents can be distinguished.        First, she
                      isolates the phonological root domain, stating (1998:175) that the rules governing
                      retraction within the root are different from those governing prefixes and suffixes.
                      Therefore, with respect to retraction, the root should be considered a separate
                      domain from the rest of the word.        However, Czaykowska-Higgins does include
                      the reduplicative -C; VC) suffix within the phonological root domain since any
                      retracted segments within this suffix may in fact be a result of copying segments
                      that have already been retracted within the root.         In addition, Czaykowska-
                      Higgins (1998:177) notes that when the reduplicative           Cj VC2-suffix is affixed to a
                      root, it “does not alter the stress properties of the Root, and therefore stress is
                      assigned in the word as if the reduplicative suffix were not there”.
                              The phonological stem, which contains the phonological root and all
                      remaining suffixes, is distinguished from the phonological word in that prefixes
                      are excluded.    The boundaries of these domains have, like the phonological root,
                      also been established based on the properties of retraction and stress assignment.
                      Czaykowska-Higgins first points out (1998:178—179) that prefixes are subject to
                      optional regressive retraction while suffixes are subject to generally non-optional
                      progressive retraction.    This suggests that prefixes and suffixes are each
                      contained within separate domains.         Czaykowska-Higgins also points out that
                      stress-assignment takes place within the domain of the phonological root and the
                      following suffixes, and is never assigned to prefixes. This indicates that the
                      phonological root and subsequent suffixes should be considered a single domain
                      distinct from the prefixes. Thus, Czaykowska-Higgins includes all suffixes along
                      with the phonological root as part of the phonological stem, which itself
                      combines with the prefixes to form the phonological word.",[41]

                     3.4.2   Determining if a Category is Derivational or Inflectional
                             The literature outlines numerous criteria for distinguishing between
                      derivation and inflection, but in reality it has proven impossible to determine a
                      steadfast set of rules with cross-linguistic application that predict which
                      categories should be considered derivational and which inflectional.               Bybee
                      (1985) considers the derivational vs. inflectional distinction to be a gradient one
                     whereby categories most intrinsically tied to the root (i.e. derivational) are at one
                      end of a spectrum while the categories least tied to the root (i.e. inflectional) are at
                      the other.   Bybee (p.99) makes certain generalizations regarding the cross-
                      linguistic status of some categories, however acknowledging that a derivational
                      category in one language may be inflectional in another.           This is also noted by
                      Anderson (1992:82), who uses diminutive formation in Fula (Niger-Congo) and
                      English as a comparative example; the diminutive category is considered to be
                      inflectional in Fula, while in English diminutive forms are viewed as derivational.
                              Cases like this where one category can appear at different ends of a
                      spectrum depending on the language, involve more than just a distinction as to
                     where the operation actually takes place (i.e. the lexicon vs. syntax).             Bybee
                      states (1985:99) that “in cases where similar conceptual content is expressed in
                     the two different ways, we will find that the inflectional expression requires a
                     fully general meaning, while the derivational does not”. Hence, while English
                     and Fula each have a diminutive category, the claim that it is derivational in one

                     tied to the root than the latter.2!
                              Of the numerous criteria found in the literature, I have focused on five
                      while determining which categories belong at the derivational stem level and
                      which at the inflectional stem level in Nxa?amxcin: (i) the Peripheral Affix Test;
                      (ii) semantic relevance; (iii) the ability to change features in lexical
                      representations; (iv) portmanteau morphemes; (v) the Free Analog Test.
                              (i) The Peripheral Affix Test. The first of these criteria is the widely noted
                      observation (appearing as Universal 28 in Greenberg 1963 and as The
                      Peripheral Affix Test in Beard 1995) regarding the cross-linguistic consistency of
                      ordering of derivational and inflectional morphemes with respect to each other.
                      Anderson (1992:77) writes that:
                              [...] in forms where both derivational and inflectional morphology are
                              overtly represented, material corresponding to productive inflection comes
                              “outside of’ other morphology. That is, where two or more suffixes are
                              involved, inflectional ones come after derivational ones; and where
                              prefixes are involved, inflectional ones come before derivational ones.
                              Even where a prefix and a suffix are involved, an argument can sometimes
                              be constructed for the relative order in which they must have been added
                              to the stem, and in such cases as well the derivational material seems to be
                              added prior to the addition of productive inflection.
                      Thus, we can expect to find derivational morphemes closer to the root than
                      inflectional morphemes.
                              There are a number of operations in Nxa?amxcin that are quite clearly tied
                      to the root and can thus be considered derivational based on the Peripheral Affix
                      Test. These categories are marked by either morphemes or reduplicated forms and
                      always appear at the innermost core of the Nxa?amxcin word.               The inchoative
                      and out-of-control markers actually appear inside the root as infixes, as shown in
                      (45) and (46) respectively:
                             21Interestingly enough, I have often had difficulty directly eliciting
                     causative and inchoative constructions in Nxa?amxcin. While causative and
                     inchoative are clearly syntactic categories in English, they are derivational in
                     Nxa?amxcin. Under Bybee’s analysis the derivational causative and inchoative
                     categories should have meanings that are of greater relevance to the predicate
                     than the causative and inchoative categories realized as independent syntactic
                     items. This might account for the difficulty in eliciting these constructions.","[66, 67]"

                      3.2 An Alternate View of Word Formation in Nxa?amxcin
                              As just discussed, Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998) claims that three
                      separate domains can be identified in Nxa?amxcin morphological structure.
                      These are the morphological root, the morphological stem (which contains the
                      root and all lexical morphology), and the morphological word (which contains the
                      stem and all morphosyntactic morphology).           In this section I suggest that the
                      following three domains be recognized:6                             6Glosses for the abbreviations are as follows:
                     ASP = aspect                    GR = grammatical relation               PS = possessive
                     CTR = control                   NM = nominalization                     RL = relational
                     DIM = dimension                 NUM = number                            VAL = valence
                     DIR = directional               PER = person                            VC = voice
                                                     POS = positional

                      the morphological spelling component appear.           Those in italics represent
                      reduplicative and/or infixal spelling operations.       Grammatical relation-person-
                      number, (suffixal) aspect, and (suffixal) possessive marking are each placed on
                      separate levels in (6) as they are mutually exclusive.
                              If we compare the notationally expanded structure in (4) to (6) with
                      Czaykowska-Higgins’ in (2), we see that these analyses do not share an identical
                      domain.7    In the sections to follow, I adopt Czaykowska-Higgins’ claim that the
                      root must be viewed as an independent phonological domain in Nxa?amxcin
                      word formation.     With respect to morphological structure, however, I propose an
                      alternate analysis. First, I suggest that a lexemic stem domain be recognized as
                      opposed to a root domain.      This lexemic stem contains the phonological
                     representation of a lexeme, in essence the phonological root plus any reanalyzed
                     morphology.      I subsequently maintain, following Czaykowska-Higgins, that a
                     root stem must be recognized at the phonological level. I then compare my
                             7The terminology used for the lexical and inflectional affixes in this
                     dissertation differs somewhat from the terminology used in the work of
                     Czaykowska-Higgins. For explanation of the terms used in this dissertation, see
                     particularly chapters 6 and 7.","[44, 45]"

                     3.3.1 The Lexemic Stem
                              The need for recognizing a lexemic stem has been put forward by a
                     number of Salishanists working in the area of word formation.? Hess (1993:113),
                      in his analysis of Lushootseed verb stems, writes:
                             The root is easily discernible in the vast majority of Lushootseed verbs;
                             however, it is the stem and not the root that is the basic descriptive unit of
                             that verb. The descriptive primacy of the stem has gone unnoticed for
                             many years due to the salience of the root (almost always CVC) which
                             attracted (or distracted) the researchers’ attention and because several
                             stem classes turned out to have identical shapes in most utterances
                             effectively camouflaging significant differences among them.
                     N. Mattina (1996) follows Hess’s approach in her study of word formation in
                      Okanagan, stating (p.15-—6):
                             Because of the importance of the canonical (C)CVC(C) shape in defining
                             Salish roots, we cannot equate the Salishan root with the general term
                             lexeme, as we can in many other languages. The most obvious reason for
                             this is that there are many lexemes that do not have the canonical shape of
                             aroot. These are forms that are wholly or partially unanalyzable by
                             speakers, but which speakers nevertheless recognize as words.
                             While the phonological representation for many Nxa?amxcin lexemes is
                     the root itself, for some lexemes this is not the case. There are numerous examples
                     in Nxafamxcin whereby a root and some additional morphology are reanalyzed.
                     These additional reanalyzed segments were at one time prefixes, suffixes, infixes,
                     or segments resulting from phonological operations such as reduplication, which
                     cooccurred with a particular root. As Black (1996:236) notes in her discussion of
                            9Michelson’s 1990 analysis of Oneida also acknowledges the need to
                     recognize such stems in an analysis of word formation.",[48]

                                Kinkade considers the topical object marker to be inflectional object
                      marking which surfaces between transitive and subject marking, as schematized
                      for Nxa?amxcin in (96):
                      (96)      Transitive      + Topical Object      + 3rd Person Subject
                         e.g.      -nt-         +          -wa-       +          -S
                      Kinkade (1989a:9) notes that “[s]ince the only thing that ever occurs between a
                      transitivizing suffix and a subject suffix is an object suffix, the topical object
                      suffixes must also be object markers”.          It is difficult to determine morphologically
                      if this is the case in Nxa?amxcin since topical object constructions are restricted
                      to 3rd person, and 3rd person objects are otherwise always unmarked.                  It could
                      instead be posited that topical object constructions are comprised of a voice
                      marker followed by 3rd subject marking, as schematized in (97):
                      (97)      Transitive      + Voice    + 3rd Person Object        + 3rd Person Subject
                         e.g.       -nt-        +   -wa-   +      (no marking)        +         -S
                      Throughout this work, I will assume that topical object operations are in fact
                      voice operations as the relative topicality of arguments is affected.          More
                      specifically, I will assume that the -wa suffix marks topical object voice only, as
                      schematized in (97), and is not reflective of object agreement on the predicate.
                      Assuming this analysis allows one to preserve the generalization that 3rd person
                      object agreement is always null.
                                Topical object voice is marked on bivalent stems by the suffix -wa when
                      stressed and the suffix -u when unstressed.          The latter is phonologically
                      predictable given that unstressed vowels are often deleted and glides become
                      vocalized within a consonant cluster.          As noted above, this operation is restricted

                      applicative predicate, all marked for topical object voice.          In (99) the topical
                      object suffix is stressed and surfaces as -wa, while in (98) and (100) it is
                      unstressed and reduced to -u.
                              Whether or not external possession stems (section 6.1.5) can be marked for
                      topical object voice remains to be determined.        If it is grammatically possible, it is
                      most likely limited to external possession stems involving 3rd person possessors.
                      Since topical object constructions are restricted to 3rd person, and direct objects
                      marked for 1st/2nd person possessor trigger 1st/2nd person object agreement on
                      the predicate, one would not expect topical object voice to surface in this
                      environment.
                              The primary pragmatic function of topical object voice is keeping track of
                      third person arguments (Kinkade 1989a, 1990b), thus avoiding any ambiguity
                      that might arise when more than one third person is being referred to in discourse.

                      (90)      N—-     X     N~   where X €   {A,N,V}
                     The above rule indicates that an adjective, noun or verb stem can combine with a
                     noun stem to form a complex noun stem.           Some examples involving adjectives are

                             It is possible for a verb stem to surface as the initial stem in this word
                     structure rule, but it is difficult to find examples that have not been lexicalized.
                     One clear example is found in Kinkade 1998b:
                     (97)    n-hac=aép=xn
                             LOC-tie=rope=foot

                             There are three right-edge bound stems that are not accounted for by the

                     that conveys an adverbial meaning.          Consider the following examples:
                     (98)     kn      thal’hal’x”’d4na?
                                     t-hal’-hal’x”=ana?
                              lsS + POS-AUG-freeze=ear
                              My ears froze.                                                             W8.189

                              POS-spill=all over-TR-(3AB)-(2sS)       +   IMP
                              You spill water on it!                                                     W7.192
                     In (98), the bound stem =ana? has the nominal interpretation of ‘ear’, while in
                     (99) it has the adverbial meaning ‘all over’.        Examples like (99) suggest that the
                     following word structure rule is operative in Nxa?amxcin:
                     (100) V > V Adv                              Two right-edge bound stems appear to have extended their core nominal
                     meaning to a verbal meaning.           The bound stem =ank has the core meaning
                      ‘stomach’ but is also glossed as ‘want’.       Compare the following examples:
                     (101)    q*tnank
                              q’tun=ank
                              big=stomach
                              big stomach (fat or pregnant)
                     (102)    lut’   kn        = n?itnank
                                                 n-?iin=ank

                              Likewise the right-edge bound stem =aya? has the core meaning ‘head’
                     which has been extended the verbal meaning ‘pretend’, as shown in (103) and
                     (104):

                             Examples (103) and (104) suggest that the following word structure rule is
                     present in the language:
                     (105)        VoVV                     The rule in (105) indicates that two verb stems can combine to form a complex
                     verb stem.
                             In the previous section we saw consistency between word structure rules
                     used to form a?-, unmarked and right-edge bound stem compounds.                     The word
                     structure rules in (100) and (105) are inconsistent with the pattern and apply to
                     only one or two bound stems respectively.          I can only speculate at this point but I
                     suspect that examples (99), (102) and (104) are not instances of bound stem
                     compounds, but rather the forms =ana?, =ank and =aya? are functioning as
                     grammatical morphemes in these examples.
                             Hinkson (1999:118) has already indicated that “[t]he suffix *an’/nak is
                     attested with desiderative force and acquires grammatical meaning in the
                     Southern Interior Salish languages Columbian and Okanagan”.                It is possible that
                      =aya? ‘pretend’ could also be subsumed under the category mood.                    With respect
                     to =aya? ‘all over’, we have already seen the prefix ni?- ‘among a bunch of
                     things’ analyzed as a grammatical marker, and it would therefore not be a stretch
                     to consider =aya? ‘all over’ as a grammatical morpheme.
                             It is very difficult to prove the status of these bound stems as lexical or
                     grammatical, and I will leave this question open for future research.","[373, 374, 375, 376]"

                      1.3 Outline of the Dissertation
                                This dissertation is very much a data-oriented as opposed to results-
                      oriented piece of work which basically falls into two parts. The first part, chapters
                      2 and 3, provide background information to the second part, the grammatical
                      sketch.    Nxa?amxcin falls under the traditional label “polysynthetic” as words
                      tend to be long and morphologically complex.           As a result, understanding how
                      words are put together in this language is relevant to essentially all aspects of its
                      grammar.      Thus, I begin by outlining the theoretical approach to word formation
                      adopted in this work.     A lexeme-based approach to word formation (Matthews
                      1972, 1991; Aronoff 1976, 1994; Anderson 1992; Beard 1995) has proved to
                      have the best explanatory value in the case of Nxa?amxcin.              Chapter 2 provides
                      an introduction to Beard’s (1995) Lexeme-Morpheme Base Morphology and a
                      brief comparison of this lexeme-based framework with a morpheme-based
                      approach like Lieber (1992).       Note that it is not the purpose here to argue for the
                      superiority of any particular theoretical viewpoint.        I am incorporating a
                      theoretical framework simply as a tool to facilitate a description of the language.
                                In chapter 3, I present an analysis of Nxa?amxcin word structure,
                      specifically focusing on the concepts of root and lexeme.          I argue for a lexemic
                      (as opposed to roof) stem domain in addition to a derivational and inflectional
                      stem at the level of morphological word structure.         I compare my analysis with
                      that of Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998), who proposes a morphological root
                      domain.     I then adopt Czaykowska-Higgins’ analysis that the root is the primary
                      domain at the level of phonological word structure.
                                Having established a theoretical framework and an analysis of the internal
                      structure of words, I then turn to the second part of the dissertation, which is the
                      grammatical sketch. In Chapter 4, I provide a brief introduction to Nxa?amxcin
                     phonology.       Following works by Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade, I discuss
                     the segment inventory of the language, the status of schwa, various segmental
                     processes, syllable structure and stress. In Chapter 5, I present a description of
                     Nxa?amxcin syntax. I first briefly look at the question of whether or not lexical
                     categories should be distinguished in Nxa?amxcin based on an ongoing debate
                     in Salish linguistics. Assuming that verbs, nouns and adjectives are distinct

                     categories in Nxa?amxcin, I then turn to the syntax of noun phrases, simple
                     clauses, relative clauses and fronting constructions.
                             The morphology of Nxa?amxcin is an extensive topic, and is divided here
                     into three separate chapters. Chapter 6 is an overview of lexical operations in the
                     language (i.e. derivational morphology). In this chapter, I address the categories
                     of valence, voice, aspect, control, category-changing operations, locative,
                     dimension (i.e. augmentative, diminutive), and relational. Chapter 7 is an
                     overview of inflectional operations (i.e. inflectional morphology).           Categories
                     discussed are person, number and grammatical relation, viewpoint aspect, mood,
                     temporal marking, negation, non-declarative speech (i.e. interrogative, imperative,
                     prohibitive), and nominalization.
                              The focus of Chapter 8 is compounding, for which I distinguish three
                      separate types in Nxa?amxcin.        The first two types involve free stems only and
                      are referred to as af-compounds and unmarked compounds. I refer to the third
                     type as bound stem compounds.            This type of compounding is generally labelled
                      lexical affixation in the literature.    I enter into the debate over whether these
                      bound stem constructions are syntactically engaged or formed by compounding,
                      and I provide morphological and syntactic arguments in support of a compound
                      analysis.
                              Chapter 9 provides a summary of this work.","[17, 18, 19]"

                     2.2.2   Lexical and Inflectional Operations
                             Many linguists follow the SPLIT MORPHOLOGY HYPOTHESIS (a term coined
                     by Perlmutter (1988)) in assuming that derivational and inflectional morphology
                     take place at different levels in the grammar, respectively the lexicon and syntax
                      (Matthews 1972; Aronoff 1976, 1994; Anderson 1982, 1992). Numerous
                      arguments have been put forward throughout the literature in support of a
                      distinction between derivation and inflection.        The major defining points between
                      derivational and inflectional morphology are outlined in section 3.4.2.
                              Beard (1995) also views derivation and inflection as taking place at
                      different levels in the grammar, but he claims that “bound derivational morphemes
                      do not differ in any significant respect from inflectional ones” (p.46).           Beard
                      views derivation and inflection in terms of operations on a stem and labels these
                      “lexical derivation” and “inflectional derivation” respectively.           In order to avoid
                      any confusion with the traditional use of the term “derivation”, I will use the
                      terms lexical operation for Beard’s “lexical derivation” and inflectional
                      operation for his “inflectional derivation”.      Grammatical features are realized
                      through lexical and inflectional operations.       The component responsible for these
                      operations is either the Lexicon (lexical operations) or the Syntax (inflectional
                      operations).    (The Semantics component is responsible for any semantic
                      operations, but I will not address this aspect of word formation in this work.)             A
                      partially constructed representation for a LMBM          model of grammar is given in (6)
                      (Beard 1995:45 with some modifications and omissions):

                      from the lexicon and first undergoes a lexical operation in which the grammatical
                      feature [+N] is added.      There is no phonology added at this point, only the
                      grammatical feature. Once all lexical operations have been completed, the form
                     reaches the level of D-Structure.       It then undergoes an inflectional operation in
                     which the feature [+pl] is added. Again, only this grammatical feature is added,
                      and not any phonology.        Once all inflectional operations have been completed,
                      the form reaches the level of S-Structure. At this point the list of grammatical
                      features for bakers is complete and no further operations on the grammatical
                      features take place.     I will illustrate the lexical and inflectional operations on the
                      grammatical features of the lexeme bake as follows:

                     The phonological marking of grammatical operations are produced by a single
                     component, regardless of whether the operations are lexical or inflectional.           Beard
                     refers to this as THE INTEGRATED SPELLING HYPOTHESIS, and he labels the
                     component responsible for phonological operations the Morphological-Spelling

                      In the above examples there is variation in valence from one verb to the next.             In
                      example (2) sleep subcategorizes for one single argument, Susie; in example (3)
                      beat subcategorizes for two arguments, Susie, and the direct object rug; in (4) the
                     verb give subcategorizes for three arguments, Susie and the objects Christopher
                      and ice cream.    We can say that the verb sleep in (2) is low in valence as it
                      subcategorizes for one argument only.         The verb give in example (4), on the other
                     hand, is high in valence, subcategorizing for three arguments.
                             Operations that change the valence of a predicate are referred to as
                     valence-changing operations.         Bybee (1985:20) states that “[v]alence-changing
                     categories such as transitive, intransitive and causative are highly relevant to the
                     situation described in the verb stem, since the situation expressed by the verb
                     stem changes according to the number and role of the participants in the
                     situation”.    Czaykowska-Higgins (1996, 1998) includes valence-changing
                     categories as part of her morphosyntactic grouping of morphemes.               While
                     valence-changing operations are clearly relevant to the syntax in that they have a
                     direct effect on the number of argument positions to be projected, I adopt the
                     view that valence operations are contained within the derivational stem since I
                     am assuming that operations altering properties contained within the lexical entry
                     of a lexeme are, in fact, lexical.
                             In the following sections, I discuss the operations subsumed under the
                     category valence in Nxa?amxcin.          First, I discuss the predicates that are the
                     lowest in valence:     monovalent intransitives.      I then turn to the various valence-

                      operations ever cooccurr.      In fact, they are each marked in the same slot within
                      the derivational stem, as indicated in (5):

                      direct argument.      Intransitive verbs are easily identifiable in Nxa?amxcin as
                      subject agreement is realized by a clitic for 1st and 2nd person, or the predicate is
                     unmarked for 3rd person, as shown in (6) and (7):

                     complex.     Bare intransitives, like the ones in (6) and (7), are simply lexemic stems,
                     which can be solely the phonological root, or the phonological root plus some
                     reanalyzed morphology.         Only a subset of Nxa?amxcin verbs can surface as bare
                     intransitives.   Other intransitive predicates must undergo some kind of
                     morphological spelling operation.
                             A common morpheme surfacing on intransitive predicates is the suffix -m.
                     This suffix, ubiquitously glossed as ‘middle’ throughout the Salish literature, has
                     an extensive usage in the Salish family (see Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade
                     1998 and Kroeber 1999) and is an excellent example of the lack of one-to-one

                      this suffix marks Ist pl. subjects and Ist/2nd sg. second paradigm objects (section
                      7.1). The suffix -m is also the pan-Salish marker for passive, antipassive and
                      middle voice. This multi-functional usage of the suffix -m is addressed for other
                      Salish languages by Salishanists such as Gerdts and Hukari (1998) and Beck
                      (2000a) who take a unificational approach towards the various usages of this
                      suffix in Bella Coola and Halkomelem respectively, following the work of
                      Kemmer (1993).
                              There is an additional function associated with the suffix -m which is
                      difficult to pin down in terms of grammatical and semantic features. Its
                      distribution appears to be connected with a split between unergative and
                      unaccusative-type verbs, which has been previously noted by H. Davis (1997a)
                      for Lillooet.   These verb-types, which are differentiated under the Unaccusative
                      Hypothesis (Perlmutter 1978; Burzio 1986), are schematized in (8) following
                      Levin and Rappaport Hovav (1995:3):
                      (8)     a.      Unergative verb:         NP   [ve V ]
                              b.      Unaccusative verb:       __ [vp V NP/CP ]
                     As (8) indicates, each of these verb-types subcategorize for a single direct
                      argument, the difference between the two being that unergative verbs
                      subcategorize for an external argument, while unaccusative verbs subcategorize
                      for an internal argument.     At the surface level, the single direct argument assumes
                     the role of external argument.
                             In this work I assume that both unergatives and unaccusatives are
                     primitive in Nxa?amxcin, following cross-linguistic claims made by Grimshaw
                     (1987), Rosen (1989a), Van Valin (1990), Zaenen (1993), Levin and Rappaport
                     Hovav (1995), among others.! Gerdts (1991) isolates two tests which distinguish
                             1There is no general agreement on this point in Salish. Gerdts (1991)
                     claims there is evidence for an unaccusative-unergative split in Halkomelem, as
                     does Howett (1993) for Thompson. However H. Davis (1997a) argues, based on
                     evidence from Lillooet, that only unaccusatives are primitive.","[133, 134, 135]"

                      It is of interest to note that 1st and 2nd sg. not only share the same marker in the
                      possessive paradigm, but also in the second paradigm for object agreement (see
                      (22)) where both are realized as -m.
                              Examples of Ist and 2nd pl. possessive marking are as follows:
                      (49)    q’*dyloqstt

                              3rd person, which is also represented by a suffix, is not marked for number,
                      as was the case with 3rd person subject and object agreement suffixes.             Some
                      examples are given in (51) and (52):
                      (51)    st’4mka?s
                              st’amka?-s

                              If we compare the possessive paradigm in (45) with the transitive subject
                      agreement paradigm in (10), we find a number of similarities between the two.
                      The most striking is the fact that 1st and 2nd person pl. and 3rd person are

                              Transitive subject agreement is marked by suffixes (as opposed to the
                      clitics found in the intransitive subject agreement paradigm).3         The transitive
                      subject paradigm is as follows:
                      (10)    Transitive Subject Agreement
                              Person+Number+Grammatical Relation

                      The above diagram represents a split system, as was seen for intransitive subject
                      agreement in the preceding section. Both 1st and 2nd person are jointly marked
                      for person, number and grammatical relation by a single morpheme.             Two forms
                     are given for Ist person singular: -n and -nn. Kinkade (1982b:50) states that -nn
                     surfaces immediately following a stressed vowel.4 Compare (11) and (12) below:

                             3Kroeber (1999: 16-17) notes that the use of clitics with intransitive
                     predicates and suffixes with transitive predicates for subject marking is unique to
                     the Interior languages. Newman (1979a, 1980) claims that this pattern goes back
                     to Proto-Salish.
                             4Kinkade (p.49-50) notes that “this can occur only when -ci- ‘2 sg.
                     object’ or -stti- ‘causative’ (with a zero 3 sg. object) occurs”.","[301, 302]"

                      1.2 The Data
                              The Nxa?amxcin data presented in this dissertation comes from three
                      separate sources:    (i) M. Dale Kinkade’s files from the 1960’s and 1970’s which
                      contain numerous dialogues and narratives along with independently elicited
                      examples; (ii) Ewa Czaykowska-Higgins’ field notes from the 1980’s and 1990’s
                      which contain primarily independently elicited examples along with a lengthy
                      narrative; (iii) my own field notes from the 1990’s consisting of independently
                      elicited examples. All of Kinkade’s and Czaykowska-Higgins’ examples cited in
                     the dissertation contain the original record number from the source.            The key to
                     the record numbers is given in Appendix One.            Examples not marked with a
                     record number are from my own field sessions with Agatha Bart, Matilda Bearcub
                      and Norine Smith.
                              The data found throughout this work is presented in a four part structure,
                      illustrated below:

                      With respect to line 1, I have chosen to write the Nxa?amxcin examples
                      throughout this dissertation in phonological form.         This is necessary in order to
                      maintain consistency, as many of Kinkade’s and Czaykowska-Higgins’
                      transcriptions are phonetic while my own are primarily phonological.               Some
                      consonant symbols have been changed to match the phonological system
                      presented in section 4.1. It is generally assumed that schwa is not underlying in
                      Nxa?amxcin, but in order to maintain consistency the following are represented
                      in the data: (i) all transcribed root schwas; (ii) all bound stem schwas; (iii) all
                      epenthetic schwas adjacent to glottals; and (iv) schwas resulting from the nasal to
                      schwa shift.     Excrescent schwas and most epenthetic schwas have been omitted
                      from the data.    I do include such phonological operations as the spreading of
                      retraction and glottalization in the surface forms, even though these are generally
                      not considered to be underlying.       I have also taken the liberty in some cases to
                      separate certain constituents in accordance with my analysis.           For example, the
                      imperative marker ta? is generally written as a suffix; however | analyze it as a
                      clitic and thus write it as a separate element from its host.
                              In line 2 of the four-part structure, I use the symbol “+” for a clitic
                      boundary; the symbol “+” for an infix boundary; and the symbol “=” for a
                      bound stem (lexical affix) boundary.       Translations in line 4 are directly from the
                      source, unless in square brackets indicating some alteration on my part. As
                      gender is not marked in Nxa?amxcin grammar, I have changed instances of
                      “she” and “he” to “s/he” and likewise “her” and “him” to “her/him” in all
                      directly elicited examples (but not in examples from stories and narratives as they
                      are set in a context). While “it” can also be included in many of these cases, in
                      others it may be prohibited on semantic grounds unfamiliar to me, so I therefore
                      exclude it. Translations of ungrammatical examples marked by an asterisk appear
                     in round brackets.","[16, 17]"

                     5.1   Lexical Categories
                             In this section I briefly address the question of lexical categories in
                     Nxa?amxcin.       Before beginning any discussion of Nxa?amxcin lexical
                     categories, however, it is important to address the ongoing controversy in the
                      Salish literature over the status of nouns and verbs as independent lexical
                     categories.    Czaykowska-Higgins and Kinkade (1998:35) remark that “[o]ne of
                     the important controversies in the study of Salish languages concerns the
                     question of whether or not these languages exhibit a distinction between the
                     categories ‘noun’ and ‘verb’ ”. This is an issue that has long been debated in
                     the field of Salish studies. Researchers such as Kuipers (1968), Hukari (1977),
                     Demers and Jelinek (1982, 1984), Kinkade (1983b), Jelinek (1993, 1995, 1998)
                     and Jelinek and Demers (1994) have argued, based on morphological and/or
                     syntactic evidence in various Salish languages, that Salish does not distinguish
                     between nouns and verbs.        In essence, there is no lexical category [+V, -N]
                     indicating verb, and no lexical category [-V, +N] indicating noun.
                             Van Eijk and Hess (1986), Beck (1995, 2002), Demirdache and
                     Matthewson (1996), N. Mattina (1996), Haag (1998), and Davis and Matthewson
                     (1999) have all argued for a noun-verb distinction using morphological and/or
                     syntactic arguments for a wide array of Salish languages.           Kroeber (1999:33-36)
                     also adopts this approach.      The general claim is that at the lexical level there are
                     two distinct categories [+V, -N] and [-V, +N], even though these categories may
                     have fewer properties distinguishing them from each other than in other language
                     families.
                             While the general debate has focused on nouns vs. verbs, the status of
                     adjectives in the grammar is also questionable.3         Consider the following
                     Nxa?amxcin examples:
                             2] do not address subordinate clauses in this chapter.         See sections 7.3.1
                     and 7.7 for relevant data.
                            3The status of adverbs is unclear and will not be addressed here.","[93, 94]"

                      argument st’a?cinom ‘deer’ has been clefted, surfacing to the left of the                      predicate ?aw’tap ‘follow’ and followed by the subordinating particle fu?.               Like
                      active voice constructions, the ergative argument (transitive subject) of a topical
                      object construction can be optionally marked by quirky case, hence the
                      appearance of an oblique marker preceeding st’a?cinam ‘deer’.               However, unlike                      active voice constructions, the predicate of the clefted ergative argument is
                      preceded by the particle wa.       In active voice constructions this is only the case
                      when an absolutive argument is clefted.
                              What examples (113b) and (114) show is that the agent (or non-topic
                      argument) in topical object constructions shows properties of both active voice
                      ergative and absolutive arguments.        First, the topical object agent can be marked
                      for quirky case, a noted property of ergative arguments.           Second, the topical
                      object agent can trigger the appearance of the particle wa, a noted property of
                      absolutive arguments in active voice constructions.
                              The properties of topical object voice are summarized below:

                                According to Givén (1994, 2001), in passive voice constructions the
                      patient is the most topical argument while the agent is non-topical.           Kroeber
                      (1999:25) writes that “[a]ll Salish languages have some sort of construction that
                      is used to mark reduced topicality of the agent of a transitive clause, and/or
                      increased topicality of the patient (object) of the clause. The discourse functions
                      of these constructions are analogous to those of passives of European languages
                      [...]”. Following Givén’s schema in (194), we can illustrate this as follows:
                      (116)     Relative Topicality of Agent and Patient in Nx Passive Voice
                                Agent   << Patient
                      Cross-linguistically, one generally finds that in passive voice constructions the
                      patient argument is the clause subject and the agent is either oblique or
                      suppressed altogether.      Nxa?amxcin passives are stereotypical in that (i) the
                      predicate is overtly marked for passive voice; (ii) the patient is realized as subject;
                      and (iii) the agent is either marked oblique or is omitted.
                                With respect to the first property, passive predicates are marked by the
                      suffix -m, the same suffix used to mark antipassive and middle voice, along with
                      several other functions.       Some examples of predicates marked for passive voice
                      are given below:

                              8Cases of agents morphologically combining with predicates are rare cross-
                     linguistically, but have been noted for Nxa?amxcin by Czaykowska-Higgins,
                     Willett and Bart (1996) and for Athapaskan languages by Axelrod (1990), Rice
                     (2000), Rice and Saxon (in press), among others.
                              10] label these predicates unergative based on cross-linguistic semantic
                     properties of unergative verbs (Perlmutter 1978). I have not yet found a
                      syntactic test that separates unergatives from unaccusatives in Nxa?amxcin.
                              11This is no doubt for semantic reasons since unergatives generally imply
                     that some volition is involved on the part of the agent, limiting possible subjects
                     to animate beings. There are only two animate lexical suffixes that surface with
                     predicates in Nxa?amxcin: =alt ‘child’ and =sqaxa? ‘domestic animal’. The
                     latter is not as frequent in the data as the former.",[371]

                                                                                                               401                     Both of the above examples illustrate lexical compounds in which a verb stem
                     and a noun stem combine to form a complex predicate.
                             For all of the examples given in (186) to (189), Mithun claims (p.856) that
                     “a V stem and a N stem are combined to form an intransitive predicate denoting a
                     unitary concept.     The compound is more than a description; it is the name of an
                     institutionalized activity or state. The IN loses its individual salience both
                     semantically and syntactically. It no longer refers to a specific entity; instead, it
                     simply narrows the scope of the V”.
                             Mithun refers to her Type II NI as the manipulation of case.            This type of
                     noun incorporation is like lexical compounding in that the incorporated noun is
                     not marked for definiteness, number or case. The noun is no longer a syntactic
                     argument in the clause, but instead qualifies the verb with which it combines.            The
                     difference between the manipulation of case and lexical compounding is that
                     the former allows for an oblique argument to appear in the case position that
                     would normally be occupied by the incorporated noun.               Thus, while lexical
                     compounding results in intransitive predicates, the manipulation of case results
                     in transitive predicates even though the incorporated noun does not serve as the
                     syntactic direct object.      Mithun gives the following examples from Yucatec
                     Mayan:23
                              Yucatec Mayan

                     In (190a) the direct object ce’ ‘tree’ is an independent constituent followed by
                     the oblique locative kool ‘cornfield’.       In (190b), ‘tree’ no longer has direct object
                     status as it has been incorporated.      Instead the locative is case-marked as the
                     direct object.","[413, 414]"
"
                      As the active example in (113a) illustrates, it is the patient of the clause (i.e. the
                      direct object ttw’it ‘boy’) that is marked by wa.           In the topical object example in
                      (113b), however, it is the agent of the clause (st’a?cinom ‘deer’) that is marked                      by wa and not the patient.      If wa is in fact linked to absolutive case, then the
                      agent of topical object constructions appears to be patterning with absolutives.
                      However, with respect to quirky case marking in which the ergative argument
                      (i.e. transitive subject) is marked oblique (section 5.3), the following example
                      suggests that it is the agent argument in topical object constructions that is in fact
                      the grammatical subject:
                      (114)   t        sx’a?cinm     tu?     wa      ?aw’tdpntus                        ttwit
                                                               ?aw ’tap-nt-wa-s
                              OBL    deer         SUB    WA     follow-TR-TO-(3AB)-3ER                  boy
                              It was the deer who followed the boy.",[167]
"
                              With respect to the second property of Nxa?amxcin passives, the patient
                      argument is the only direct argument in the passive clause. There seems to be a
                      morphological split across the Salish family in that patient agreement for passives
                      in some languages is in the form of subject agreement (as is the case with
                      Nxaramxcin), while for others it is in the form of object agreement.           The latter has
                      been noted by J. Davis (1980), Hukari (1980), Gerdts (1988, 1989a), Gerdts and
                      Hukari (2001) and Wiltschko (2001), among others. Gerdts and Hukari (2001)
                      make the tentative claim that the patient argument in Halkomelem passives is the
                      surface subject, while Wiltschko (2001) maintains it remains a surface object. It is
                      beyond the scope of this work to enter into this debate.          I will assume that the
                      patient of Nxa?amxcin passive constructions is in fact the surface subject, in line
                      with stereotypical properties of cross-linguistic passive constructions, as I have
                      no language-specific motivation to suspect otherwise.
                              3rd person intransitive subjects do not trigger any overt agreement in
                      Nxaramxcin, as we see in the following examples:

                     2.2.1 Lexeme vs. Morpheme
                             At the core of LMBM theory is the fundamental distinction between
                     lexemes and morphemes.         Beard (1995:44) defines lexemes as “direct associations

                      of properly specified sequences of phonemes, grammatical features, and semantic
                      intensions, that is, noun, verb, and adjective stems”.       In other words, the
                      phonological, grammatical and semantic features of a lexeme are mutually implied
                      and “form an integral unit at every stage of derivation.         This prohibits the
                      insertion of derivation material between them by any derivational rule”
                      (Beard:57). All open-class items are lexemes, and a lexeme represents the base
                      form of a word before any lexical or inflectional operations have taken place.
                             Returning to the example of bake in (1a), the lexical entry of this lexeme
                      from an LMBM perspective would coincide with that of a morpheme-based
                      approach as all of the lexeme’s features are mutually implied. The example in (1a)
                      is repeated below, as its representation within the LMBM           framework is the same:
                      (4)             bake
                                      {[berk]                    )           Phonological features
                                       [+V]                        f         grammatical features
                                      lto cook food in dry heat]             semantic features
                      All of the features in (4)—phonological, grammatical and semantic—form an
                      indivisible unit and, therefore, constitute a linguistic sign. Only lexemes are
                     linguistic signs and, according to Beard, only lexemes are stored in the lexicon.
                     Thus, we would expect to find only nouns, verbs and adjectives in the lexicon
                     and not affixal material.
                             The term morpheme in LMBM theory has a completely different
                     interpretation than that discussed for morpheme-based approaches in section 2.1.
                     Beard’s (1995, chapter 2) claim that lexemes and morphemes are two completely
                     different types of elements stored in separate components is, in part, driven by the
                     fact that they have such distinct properties. First, lexemes, i.e. open-class lexical
                     items, are always phonologically specified.         There are no “zero lexemes”.2      On
                     the other hand, zero morphemes are not uncommon cross-linguistically. This
                     leads into the next point. Bound-morphemes always presuppose lexemes and
                            2This statement is not without controversy. Beard refers to Mel’éuk
                     (1979) and Anceaux (1965) for analyses of zero lexemes in Russian and
                     Nimboran respectively.","[26, 27]"
