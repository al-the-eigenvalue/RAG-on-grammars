relative order of clitics is     0-(S-)VERB.     Identifying dependent
from independent markers is made difficult by two factors: one is
the SOV word order    of the language;    if the subject is either a
lexical  NP  or  an  independent   pronoun,    there   is  no position
difference                between         an     independent            and     a       dependent   object     marker:

"2.    ORDER        OF     POSTPOSITIONAL                   PHRASES
Rama is          an S O V language. The word order is relatively rigid                                                     and
is   the          basic  syntactic  device  used  for marking  subject                                                     and

Postpositional     phrases                                   can    occur   both    preverbally    and
postverbally.  Since    the                                 postpositional     phrases   often   occur
postverbally, the   language                                 cannot    be typified   as strictly  verb
finaL.  The  function  of                               the   various positions  has                            not   been
analyzed yet, but from a                               cursory inspection of textual                            materials
it appears   that the longer form of the postposition      often occurs
in postverbal    position   and the  shorter  form occurs  preverbally.
When the   longer   form  occurs  preverbally   it could  indicate  left
dislocation   of  the   postpositional  phrase.   Thus                                                    there  are      two
posible  preverbal    positions  - preverbal   within                                                    the  clause      and

cases     of         syntactic             incorporation,                    bordering                   on     lexicalization.

verbs mentioned    above we are clearly dealing with more advanced
degrees    of  lexicalization.    In   some    cases   the    process    of
lexicalization   is virtually   complete,   as    in the   aspect   marker

considering,   since,   among other things,   it precedes inflectional

This     type     of    complementation                    has     been        set     aside         because         of     the

constraint         on   their       complement             verbs.
The     causative verb is the transitive                                verb         uung~         'to   make',        which

" 4.   RAMA     SUBORDINATION           AND        CLAUSE    CHAINING:
 Clause-chaining              has     been        claimed         to     be   a     feature          of     Chibchan
 languages           (Longacre           1985).               Consideringof     the       several
characteristics      of   subordination   discussed    above    -    i.e.      that
subordination     is    done   1)  with  tenseless    verb    forms,        2)    by
suffixation of a subordinating morpheme
                                               directly on the verb, and
that   3)  the   language     is  verb  final   - the
subordination                                            issue     of   whether
                 in Rama should be considered        as a type of clause
chaining is worth raising.        Constructions akin to clause chaining
are  found   in the neighboring Misumalpan        languages,      Miskitu       and
Sumu  (Salamanca,             1988;     Norwood,           1988).
However,  unlike   Misumalpan   languages,   Rama   lacks                                       some   features
commonly   associated   with  clause   chaining.
morphological marking of subordination in             For                                       instance,    the
                                                 Rama is                                       insensitive to
the   presence         or     absence        of     coreference           between        the     main           and   the
embedded       subject.
Unlike        prototypical            clause-chaining                  languages,
exhibit                                                                                    Rama           does        not

In      (45)         the         complement                clause            appears           more         ‘embedded'            as      a
sentential direct object of the main clause.           Note the order       [
S NEG   [O-complement clause]       V ]. It is an open question whether
the    difference       of     structure    signals    a   difference    of
interpretation at this point.          Both these constructions with the
full  lexical   verb bating can take either the same or different
subjects.    When   the    two    subjects  are   coreferential,   another
possibility                    arises;         that             of      a     suffixed            ‘serialized!                   bating

meaning             may        not    be    the        most            prevalent           interpretation                   in     this
construction:  it   generally                                    fades        into     a        meaning            of     immediate
future or intention:

"The issue of why postpositions would be the source of subordina~
tors is not a very complex one.   Structurally, it has to do with
subordinate clauses being treated like nominal constituents   and
the    analogical            use       of    the       marking      of       oblique            nominal     arguments         of
a   simplex       sentence             (monoclausal)               for       oblique            clausal     arguments         of
a   complex       sentence.                 In    Rama     there        is     no    overt        feature        of   clausal
nominalization               besides  the                 stripping   of tense   on the   embedded
verb   and  the               structural                  parallelism    between   postpositional
phrases         and     adverbial                subordinate             clauses           is     easy     to    see.     They
have the          same       word order,                 both within their respective   phrasal
structure          and        within  the                 sentence  structure.  The   same   way
postpositional               phrases             are    either     post~-           or    preverbal,            subordinate

subject and the object of the preceding sequence which was about
men cuttin meat.  In  (9) the missing subject is the same as the
one        of         the        preceding           clause,                   hence         given          information,                   while               the

been previously handled by the men an is now in the hads of the
women.   In  (10)   and   (11)   both   subject   and   object are   given
information,    hence   missing.     As  mentioned    earlier,  Rama   has

5.       This            is        exactly            the     way    the        tense         markers               were     given,       i.e.     in
a        sequence                    of         'past'         (bought)               and          ‘present!               (makes)    .          This
example  is  from                                a non-native                    speaker            whose  use               of   the       tense

example                  remains                valuable            for         the        combination                of     the      causative
verb with the verb     'to drink':    The issue of what the tense of
the causative   'should'   be in this    coordinated clause where the
first coordinate   conjunct   is in the past remains to be elucida-

    3.    Verbal     morphology
The         verb     word         is        the            most        complex     element                 of     the        clause,      and
often         its    only     constituent.                         Verbal        inflection                is     of    an     agglutina-

pattern:                                                                                                                     i

"It   is worth     noting   that DuBois's  proposed     ""preferred  argument
structure’     and   'given A constraint'   came   from his search for a
motivation for the phenomenon of ergativity,          i.e. for a reson why
the    subject   of a transitive    verb would   be encoded     differently
from the subject of an intransitive verb, which in turn would be
encoded the same as the object of a transitive verb, This search
for a motivation for ergativity has cast the phenomenon in a new
light:    ergativity can now be seen as a morphological encoding of
discourse information flow.  However,  as seen with the sample                                                                           text
here,  the same pattern of information   flow obtains  in Rama,                                                                          even
though Rama is not a morphologically ergative language.",[247]

 talk about the              canonical   SOV pattern                                 of Rama.  In the reality of a
 text, one must              address   the issue of                                  the widespread phenomenon  of
 argument           ellipsis            causing            clauses              to     exhibit          a       variety          of    word
 orders.
 In    natural        texts,             there        is        a    strong           tendency              for       a    transitinve
 clause   to          have    less               than    the               two   full              NPS   in   the                surface

 ellipsis           of main arguments. Thus                               within Rama discourse it is rare
 to find           clear SOV clauses since                                pronominal and zero anaphora is
 common. (4)         kiiknadut            apaik-i

Therefore,  it should be noted again that                                                    although Rama has many
characteristics of a verb final language,
                                                                                            it is not as absolutely
verb        final        as     Turkish           or     Japanese,             as    the     relative            order      of      main
and        subordinate               clauses           shows.

Another common property of prototypical clause chaining languages
is  that in  such  languages there  exists no alternative  to the
clause        chaining            construction.               All    complex            sentences       are    made     of
chains        of    non-final             clauses          folowed         by     one        final   clause     with         a
finite verb;   there are no                       co-ranking structures,     in                      which complex
sentences  may    have  more                      than   one finite   verb.                          In   Rama,  the
subordinated    clauses   of                      the  type  discussed    here                        coexist   with
co-ranking          structures,              such     as      the    coordinated               structures      and     one
type     of    subordination                 which       is    marked           with     a    free   subordinating
conjunction             and   a    finite        verb.","[227, 228]"

three       different                questions               -     those        of        language            change,        language
death and languages    in contact - the division must be recognized
as   no  more than    an    artificial   one  for  the  sake of   data
presentation.   These    issues   are all aspects of the same general
issue       of    acknowledging                  the     historical                   and     sociological              dimensions
ef    the    language              under     study,               and    the     Unavoidable                  fact     of    language
change       and     adaptation              in        any        linguistic               description.
Placing   Rama  in    its   proper  context   is particularaly   important
since the language is well known for being a threatened language
and it is expected that it already carries with it marks of its
impending demise.        If a grammatical description of Rama is going
to   be  useful    to     comparativists    interested  in  cChibchan,   it
certainly  falls                   on      the  fieldworker to  sort through the data  as
much as possible                    in     order to distinguish characteristics that may
be attributed  to                     its    being a Chibchan language from those that
may be attributed                      to   its being caught in an accelerated pace of
change.",[268]

22. It is also well       documented that the motivation to         retain a
language is usually      the fact of a minority within the          minority
and   that the   average group   members   themselves   are not   interested
in    language   maintainance    efforts   per   se,  although    they   will
participate more willingly        in non-linguistic cultural activities
which provide easier links       with past tradition (Edwards 1985:72).

characteristics                of the     grammar of Rama.                     Whenever appropriate   or
possible,           it         places      the      language             in     the      context        of       the
(Macro-)Chibchan                 languages,        as        well   as    in    a     general     typological
context.   Some of the topics mentioned in this chapter are given
as a preview of topics of interest which are further developed in
later chapters.   Other topics are raised here in order to settle
that they are not of particular interest in the grammar of Rama.","[40, 41]"

The     position                of        the     tense~-aspect-modality                 markers              as    post-verbal
and     the        prototypical                   order       [aspect+tense]            found           in    Rama    are     taken
to be reflections    of both the general typological  features                                                               of the

argued that for the majority                                    of the aspect markers, the source is
a lexical verb.    This is the                                  case for the complete aspect -atkul-
 (and its allomorph ~atkut-),                                   the prospective bating-,  and all the
aspects            built on                aakar.        The lexical sources  of all these aspect
markers            co-occur                in the       language as main lexical verbs,-as  shown

description of                     the aspectual   system of Rama,    although some of the

       lexical    form   this    kind   of  object    takes   a postpositional   case

       also   sometimes  akin                        to    the  direct       object   (i.e. patient)  of

correlates with the fact, documented in numerous languages,    that
new information  is virtually never introduced  as the A-argument
of  a transitive    clause.   This   is the basis  of DuBois's   'given A
constraint'   which    we   see    confirmed  in  Rama.  Meanwhile,    new
information               (hence          full           NPs)        is    most            likely     to     be        introduced           as

2.2. Whether   this    construction     actually   is a    good   example   of
count  nouns   remains    to   be seen.      Normally   the   second   person
plural  imperative   verb    form takes   a ~dut suffix     (see chapter    10
on imperatives)   but the verb does not in this case.            This may be
an     indication         that            the    quantifier             refers        to     a   'mass'            of    people.

 4.    The         serial          verb      analysis               of    the        imperative               first          person            plural
 corresponds  to   the  encoding   of a    particular component   of    a
 prototypical  imperative  situation:   the fact that imperatives    are
 requests to move or change from one state to another.      Rama is an
 interesting  language in that its grammar encodes  the fact that
 the intended effect of the imperative speech act is the creation
 of a sequence of two actions or states:  a first state or action
 to    be         abandoned           and        moved           away         from    and      a       second           state        or        action
to be embraced       and moved   toward.    While   the serialized motion
verb   bang   marks    the motion    toward  the  desired   new  action  or
state,   there    is also in Rama the possibility of encoding in an
imperative     form the move    away   from the   first  action  or state.
This is done through the use of the relational preverb ka-, from
the         ablative               kang      ‘from',               on     the        imperative               verb.             The        use         of
this        optional               'imperative                   prefix'        is     illustrated                     below:

the         Rama        speakers.                      It        appeared             first            to     be        simply            another
imperative               marker.                 The        semantics            of    ablative,                  of     movement               away,

As     it         turned           out,      speakers               considered                all           instances               of     ka-        as

else,  or to move from one position to                                                   another:                  i.e. to sit down

 Linguistic          information                 on    the       Rama        language        is   scarce,     much      more
 so     than   for     the          other        languages              of       the     Coast.     Brinton       (1891),
 Lehmann    (1914, 1920)  and  Conzemius    (1927)  contain   word
 lists. Lehmann has reproduced 21 words that Brinton collected in
 the introduction  of his own word list of 1569 entries which is
 the largest data base available on Rama              (1920).   Lehmann's work is
 an   impressive    tour   de   force,    packed    with    information    gathered
 over   a very   short   period    of time.      Some grammatical      information
 on Rama is found in the two short sketches by Lehmann                  (1920:9-17)
 and    Conzemius     (1927:329-339).        They    cover     roughly    the    same
 topics:     sound     inventory,      basic    noun     and    verb   morphology,
 including    sections    on  so-called      ‘classifiers',      pronouns,    verbal
derivation,   negation, tense markers and numbers.     Lehmann insists
on  finding   traces    of  passives and   Conzemius gives   a list of
phrases   (337-338)   and borrowings   from English, Miskitu,   Spanish
 and    Creole       (339).              There        is    no    text       material         available     in     either

As expected    in a verb     final  language,   the    tense-aspect-modality
markers   of   Rama    are  postverbal.   There    are   two  basic   sets  of
markers,   which    in most   cases make   for separate marking      of tense
and aspect,   as shown in (1) ang (2):
(1)        maa     paun-i
           you     cry-TNs
           'you     cry;        you     are       crying'

           'we     drank        the     whole          fresco        up’
Although         generally            tense       is        separate           from        aspect     and        follows           it,
there  are other  situations.   From a structural  point of view,
variation from the aspect + tense combination consists either in
the order being reversed as shown in (3), or in there not being a

In   these     constructions,      the    verb word   is   transitive   and   is
composed     of   the   relational     preverb  ba-,  from   the  postposition
bang   'goal'    and an intransitive verb       (the already derived alp- or
the verb    ting     'to happen').      Note how the subject marker,      which
is no doubt an-inflectional type of morpheme,   intervenes                                                between
the verb root and the relational preverb, which is being                                                  presen-
ted here as if it were a derivational morpheme.","[86, 87]"
"2.4.     Summary           of     Rama     relational                 preverbs
One of the most common instances of relational preverb in Rama is
the   surface  phenomenon  of   procliticization   of   postpositions
stranded    by virtue   of zero   anaphora.©   The   procliticization
applies         to    all        postpositions                   whose       NP         object           is    subject      to    zero
anaphora,            independent               of    the        semantics               of        the    verb;         furthermore,
the proclitic relational preverb retains faithfully the semantics
of its postpositional  source. Rama also has instances of incorpo-
ration and lexicalization of specific postpositions with specific
verbs,  but these latter phenomena are more limited than in other
languages.",[149]

"2.     TYPES   OF        RELATIONAL                PREVERBS
As mentioned   at the start   of this   chapter  the term relational
preverb  is  a cover  term  which   refers   to a particular  set  of
verbal prefixes grouped together on the basis of their signaling
some   link between   the verb                             and         an   (originally)                           oblique  argument
of   the   clause.  The   term                             says          nothing    about                          the   appropriate
grammatical analysis of these preverbal                                                      morphemes, which may turn

relational                preverbs                  signal             instances                       of          'promotion'                or
‘advancement'                 of     an       oblique        NP        to         the        status           of     direct           object;
when  lexical,                 the  relational                    preverbs  function                               as    derivational

automatically                 attaches    itself                to   the  verb                  as         ae     relational
preverb.      Certain   patterns    of    oblique    argument     marking       are
therefore   determined   by   the  nature    of  the   object    NP:    while    an
overt  NP may   be marked    either    by a postposition       or by a rela-
tional   preverb,    a non-overt     one   will   always    be   marked      by    a
relational   preverb.   Although    zero    anaphora    is  the    most    common
type      of     anaphoric            expression           of    oblique           NPs         in        Rama,            an     occa-
sional         third     person           personal         pronoun          may     be        used        under                certain
discourse conditions which are not well analyzed yet.               The fact
that,   on the    rare occasion   that   the     pronoun   is used,     it is
accompanied    by    a postposition    and   not    a  relational     preverb
supports further our claim that the trigger of the procliticiza-
tion  of a postposition      is the non-overtness        of the   object    NP
itself.","[142, 143]"
