    Word order is determined by both syntactic and pragmatic factors.
    In a verbal clause, an NP, usually in absolutive case, which provides ""given"" 4
information occupies the first position, and the verb the last position. SV, OAV and
AOV 5 are commonly found constituent orders in my corpus. The first core or local
NP in absolutive case tends to be a sentential topic. (If A is a topic, it is not marked by
ergative case.) However, core NPs are often left unexpressed if understood from the
context, because they are obligatorily cross-referenced on the verb. Furthermore, any
NP which provides ""new"" information can be placed after the verb.
    The basic order of major NP constituents is:
          Determiner (Article/Demonstrative)+ Local Noun+ NP Head
          NP Head + Adjective + Classifier/Numeral/Quantifier
    Motuna distinguishes kinship, classifier, and other possessive constructions. The
first two types of possessive constructions are basically head-marking, and the last type
dependent-marking. Possessors in kinship and classifier possessive constructions are
always placed before the head, while those in other possessive constructions can
occupy either pre-head or post-head positions.
    Relative clauses can also occupy pre-head or post-head positions. Motuna has
internal relative clauses as well.",[33]
"
   Motuna places NP attributes, either in pre-head or post-head positions, primarily
according to their pragmatic functions. Pre-head attributes are used to identify the
entities referred to by the heads; post-head attributes, on the other hand, describe their
characteristics. Schematically,

      <--Identification-->                           <-- Description -->
  The relative order of pre-head attributes is fixed. Among them, those which give
more specific information for identification (such as possessive pronouns, Possessor
noun phrases or nouns, nouns which modify local nouns of positions, or pre-head
relative clauses), are placed closer to the heads, while those which give more general
information, such as LD nouns and restrictive adverbs, are placed farther away. 3

3 Seiler (1978: 309) summarises the sequential order of modifying elements in the noun phrase (whichhe calls ""determiners"") in High German as follows:
         ""The potential of a determiner D for singling out the object referred to by the head noun N
         increases proportionally with the positional distance ofD from N.""
According to Mosel (1984: 27-28), the order of pre-head NP modifiers in Tolai is governed by the same
principle.
  Motuna distinguishes ""identification"" and ""description"" as two separate parameters, and within each
parameter there seems to be a continuum, which is reflected in the positional distance of modifiers from
the head. The order of the pre-head modifiers which ""identity' the entity referred to by the head seems to
be governed by Seiler's principle. But that of the post-head modifiers which ""describe"" it seems to be
governed by more complex principles, as discussed below.
The Noun Phrase                                                                          225   The order of post-head attributes are variable, but they seem to be arranged according
to the following principles:
( 1) The one which expresses a category more inherent to the entity referred to by the
     head noun tends to be placed closer to the head. On the other hand, the one which
     gives descriptive details tends to be placed farther away. (Thus nouns or adjec-
     tives which denote inherent characteristics are placed next to the heads, while
     relative clauses are usually placed farther away.)
(2) The one which gives given information tends to be placed nearer to the head, while
     the one which gives new information tends to be placed farther away from the
     head.
(3) Among those which give new information, the one which expresses more important
     information in that particular context tends to be placed nearer to the head.","[253, 254]"
"
    Since the person and number of A and 0 NPs are obligatorily cross-referenced, in
 many cases A and/or 0 NPs can be left unexpressed without confusion. Thus the basic
· word order and case-markings of core NPs in transitive verbal clauses are:
 13 In other words, the ergative suffix marks the A argument which is not a sentential topic. In elicitation sessions, my informants sometimes marginally accepted sentences in which A NPs in
 ergative case are sentential topics at the same time. But I have found no such sentence in my entire
 corpus of narratives and daily conversation. This fits Wierzbicka's argument that 'the ergative marks
 the peripheral (less topical) actant' ( 1981: 69).

                                  word order                            NP usually functioning as a topic 14

       (2)    A(ERG)              O(ABS)                   VP                      0
       (3)    A(ABS)              O(ABS)                   VP                      A
       (4)    O(ABS)              !11                      VP           0, or unexpressed A
       (5)    A(ERG)              !11                      VP                      0
       (6)    !11                 !11                      VP           unexpressed 0 or A
As discussed above, the choice between (1) and (3) depends on which argument is the
topic. (2) is used instead of (1) when A provides given information. The 0 NP, or the
A NP in ergative case, can be placed after the verb, when they provide new information
in the discourse. 15
     In addition to core arguments, many transitive verbs can take NPs in absolutive case,
verbal nouns, verbal clauses with verbs in Definite Future TAM, or sentences in
quotation, as Complements. Examples of absolutive NPs functioning as the Comple-
ments of transitive verbs are given below (see §14.3.2.1, §14.5 and §14.6 for the
examples of different types of Complements):3-65          hoo          impa             Keehno              tang-a-'-ko-ng.

              [ 0]                 c ]
              'Now people call them Keehno tribe.' (XI-30, cf. 14-39)3-66                 hoo       ko'sa            tii        Koimeke      nep-ee-wa-ro ...

                     [     c         [  ]      0      ]
              '... after they took the shell from Koimeke, (they) .. .' (VIII-34)
     Note that the verb stem nep-ee- in 3-66 is derived by the applicative suffix -(j)ee. It
introduces a new 0 argument (Koimeke) and moves the original 0 (hoo ko'sa) into
Complement status. (See also 3-24. See Ch 14 for a detailed discussion of valency-
changing processes.)
14   Unless another absolutive NP denoting location precedes and functions as a topic. e.g. 3-15.
15 The definitions of ""new"" and ""given"" information are according to Chafe (1976). See also fn 3 in§6.2.6. In Motuna, elements which provide given information are generally placed at the beginning,
while those which provide new information are placed at the end. This rule applies both at phrase and
clause levels. cf. Ch 10.

  Intransitive verbal clauses require only one core NP in absolutive case (S).
  Predicate verb phrases in intransitive verbal clauses typically express intransitive
actions, existence, possession, changes of state, processes, or inner experiences.
Thus, semantically, S could be the Agent, the Experiencer, the Theme, or the Patient.3-67      roo                 pee              tii        Maawo       poko-no.

  Absolutive or similative NPs, APs, PartPs, verbal nouns, Definite Future verbal
clauses, or sentences in quotation, can function as the Complements of certain intransi-
tive verbal clauses. (cf. 3-8, 3-21 and 3-60. See also §14.3.1 and §14.3.2.2.)3-71      ong               noo             toko=tokoh-ah             tu-ro-ng?

     A nominal clause consists of two noun phrases, which function as the argument and
the predicate in this order. 16
     The argument NP is always in absolutive case, and the predicate NP is either in
absolutive case, or a Possessor or a local noun with a gender suffix. Predicate NPs are
usually without determiner. 17
     Semantically, nominal clauses can be classified into (1) ""equational"", (2) ""posses-
sive"" and (3) ""local"" clauses. Nominal clauses with verbal nouns as predicates are
discussed separately inCh 16.","[89, 90, 91, 92]"

"10.3.3 Post-head Attributes
10.3.3.1 Nouns and Pronouns in Juxtaposition
  Nouns or pronouns, juxtaposed to the heads, characterise, or give additional infor-
mation about, the entities referred to by their heads. The head nouns or pronouns often
denote abstract or generic concepts, e.g. hea/hialheewa 'thing, something' (10-38),
heekoo 'some place' (10-39), poti 'time' (10-40).10-38     hia       kui             roki      ni-ngi     onoh-u-h=no-ng

  Modifying nouns can further be followed by classifier construcrions (10-41), relative
clauses (10-38), etc., which can be regarded either as the modifiers of their heads, or as
those of the modifying nouns themselves:10-41      ong           hea        kuino        o-mung

In 10-49, the adjective meena clearly modifies the modifying noun nommai, and not the
NP head pa-na. In 10-50, the locative suffix -kori marks the whole NP which consists

    Local noun phrases in ergative or ablative case modify the preceding nouns or noun
phrases. Three examples are found in my corpus (see also ti-ki in 10-22):the ergative NP ti-ki Kihili:
10-53      hoo      sikuulu                  ti-ki              Kihili

              'the people from all the areas in Ruugara (Buin) and from Alu' (III-6)10.3.3.3       Adjectives and Adjectival Participles
    Adjectives and adjectival participles are usually placed immediately after the head. 65 Strictly speaking, this is not a local NP, because the head nouns Ruugara-ni and Aalu, although
they denote place names, are masculine. The former is a collective noun derived from a local proper
name by the suffix -ni. cf. §4.4.2.

              ... hoo      u'kisanung         korono-ko         hoo=hoo        manni              tuu-juu .

However, u'kisanung probably derives from u'kisa-ng 'ancient time-M', and it still seems to retain the
characteristic of a possessive noun phrase, i.e. its relative freedom of positioning (cf. § 10.3.4.4). In
this example u'kisanung is used in contrast with the modem prayers introduced by Christianity, and
thus used for identification, rather than for description. cf. § 10.3.1.

            sex +evaluation/size + shape + colour+ quantity/order
  Below are all the examples in my corpus in which two adjectives cooccur in one
noun phrase:nungamang and kuraisa (sex)+ hanna (size):

  Further examples obtained in elicitation sessions are given below:hanna (size)+ ihkaata (shape):
10-59     ang      manare hanna ihkaata
            DEM.M     road           big        long

            'one of Kangku's small white female pigs'
In 10-60, kaakata may precede pehkita in certain context, although the above order is
preferred. The numeral classifier na-wari can also be placed next to the head for
emphasis.

    As mentioned in §8.1.3.1.1, a demonstrative and an article classifier constructions,
which contain the same classifier, are often juxtaposed to indicate the distributional
plurality of the entities referred to by the classifier. Examples:a demonstrative + an article classifier constructions with -muu-ro 'object of the same
kind-nonsg' (36) as attributes:

The paradigms of verbs in Motuna are described according to this classification.
  Verbs take TAM suffixes listed in Table 12-3a- c after cross-referencing mor-
phemes. In addition, the negative infix /-woo-/ can be placed between cross-
referencing markings and the Imaginative, General DS, Continuous SS or DS medial
suffix. TAM suffixes may be followed by gender suffixes in the case of fully inflected
non-medial verbs, or may be fused with a switch-reference marking in the case of
medial verbs. Schematically,

  Transitive verbal clauses require two core arguments (0 and A), while intransitive
verbal clauses require only one (S).
  A core argument NP, or a peripheral argument NP which denotes location, can be a
sentential topic, the gender of which is marked on the ending of the verb. Topic NPs
are usually in absolutive case, but a local NP in ergative case can also function as a
sentential topic in some cases. cf. §3.2.2.2.
 60                                                                                          Chapter 3 3.3.1.1     Transitive Verbal Clauses
    Transitive verbal clauses require two core arguments. Semantically, one of them is
 characterised as Undergoer, and the other as Actor, in the transitive actions described
 by the verbs (cf. Foley and Van Valin ·1984). 3-63        . .. tii      Perui             ho-i           Paanaangah         tu-u-na.

                 [O(Undergoer)-Topic] [          A (Actor)
             '... Perui (Topic) was killed by Paanaangah.' (VII-57)
    As mentioned in §3.2.1, I use the symbol 0 and A, to indicate the grammatical
 functions of core NPs in transitive verbal clauses, which play the roles of the Under-
 goer and the Actor respectively. In Motuna, 0 is always denoted by an absolutive noun
 phrase, but A can be denoted either by an ergative or absolutive noun phrase. When A
 is a sentential topic, it must be denoted by an absolutive NP. 13
    When A is in ergative case, word order is free. However, when A is in absolutive
 case, A must precede 0. For example, in 3-63, the 0 NP in absolutive case (tii Perui)
 and the A NP in ergative case (ho-i Paanaangah) are interchangeable, but not the two
 NPs in absolutive case in the following sentence: 3-64        hoo        Paanaangah            tii      Perui              tu-u-ng.
             ART.M 'ancestor's. name'         ART.F 'witch's.name'        kill-30.3A.RMPAST -M
                  A (ABS) -Topic ]     [    0 (ABS)
             *tii     Perui            hoo      Paanaangah                tu-u-ng.
             'Paanaangah (Topic) killed Perui.'","[88, 89]"

   My final word of thanks is due to Ayuko, Takashi and our newly-born little Motona.
 They created a joyful family environment which I regard as the most valuable thing in
 my life. I could get myself refreshed whenever I spent time with them. Our second
 son's name was taken from the language name ""Motuna"" with slight modification
 according to Japanese phonology. His name will always remind me and my family of
 the years we spent in Canberra, and of our special friendship with Motuna speakers.

Abstract
  This thesis is a descriptive grammar of Motuna, a Non-Austronesian language
spoken by several thousand people in the south-western part of Bougainville (called
Siwai), Papua New Guinea. It belongs to the Buin Family of the Eastern Bougainville
stock, in the Bougainville Phylum. This grammar is based on the analysis of narrative
texts provided by four speakers of the standard Motuna.
  Motuna is a both head and dependent marking agglutinative language with complex
morphology. Like most Non-Austronesian languages in Papua NewGuinea, it is verb
final, and has medial and non-medial verbal categories. In addition, verbs have basic
voice distinction between active and middle voices, and have extensive tense/as-
pect/mood categories. Nouns have six genders and are also classified by fifty-one
classifiers.
  Chapter 1 discusses the typological characteristics, as well as the genetic relations
and dialectal variations of Motuna. It also briefly summarises previous work done on
this language, and provides the scope and data base of this thesis.
  Chapter 2 deals with phonetics, phonology and orthography. It includes an introduc-
tion to morphophonemics which will be discussed fully in later chapters, particularly in
Chapter 4 (nouns), Chapter 8 (classifiers, numerals and the 'all' quantifier), and
Chapter 13 (verbal morphology).
  Chapter 3 outlines the word-classes and the clausal syntax of this language. Chap-
ters 4 - 9 deal with the mopho-syntax of all the word classes except for verbs, partici-
ples and verbal nouns. Chapter 10 discusses the internal structure of the NP, and
Chapter 11 possessive, kinship and other constructions.
  Chapter 12 outlines the morpho-syntax of verbs. I give a gist of verbal morphology
in this chapter, so that readers may skip Chapter 13 which is a lengthy discussion of
complicated verbal morphology. Chapter 14 discusses valency of verbs including
valency-changing derivations (stimulative, causative, applicative and reciprocal).
Chapter 15 deals with tense/aspect/mood. Chapter 16 deals with two word classes
derived from verbs .,.-- verbal nouns and participles.
  Chapter 17 discusses the interclausal relations in Motuna, mainly chaining of medial
verbs and relative clauses.
  Finally, three narative texts of this language are provided in Appendix.

     The words/phrases exemplified above are represented respectively as:
       [tmpa]                             impa (liNpal)                                'now'

pronounce IN/ is in the back.
   In Motuna, the back vowel /o/ is most commonly used among the five vowels, and is also
phonologically the most neutral one (cf. §2.3 below). The back stop lk/ is also the commonest
non-nasal stop in Motuna. (Among the non-nasal stops used in three texts chosen at random, lk/
accounts for 55%, while It! and /p/ account for 29% and 16% respectively.) These facts seem to suggest
that the tongue position in articulation is predominantly in the back in Motuna.
  Among nasals (before vowels), the coronal In! is most commonly used, and the back /ng/ least.
However, if we regard that the archinasal is essentially a back nasal, this order of frequency is reversed.
13 According to Gasaway (1987b), m, nand ng alternate word-finally. In her data, the speakers of the
Pouko dialect usually use n, while those in other dialects of Motuna use either m or ng. All my
infomants (including the one who speaks the Pouko dialect), however, consistently use ng in word
final position, except for the environments described below where m is used.

  The glide phonemes /w/ and /j/ occur before vowels.
  The phoneme /w/ is realised as [{3] before Iii. When it is preceded by an archinasal,
it is realised as [b), and the preceding archinasal is always realised as [m] (cf. Rule 2-3
above). Otherwise it is realised as [w], occasionally with slight friction.","[44, 45]"

4.3 SEMANTIC CATEGORIES INDICATED BY CLASSIFIERS      Apart from the two obligatory grammatical categories discussed above, the semantic
categories of the referents of nouns may optionally be indicated by classifiers. The
categories expressed by classifiers include 'human', 'animate', 'long object', 'concave
object', 'taro', 'stone', 'human habitation', 'day', etc.
      Classifiers are always combined with various bound morphemes, or nouns or verbal
clauses. Classifier constructions thus formed may be juxtaposed to head nouns, may
be employed in headless noun phrases, or may function as NP heads by themselves. I
have attested fifty-one classifiers in my corpus and from elicitation.
      Some nouns can take two or more different classifiers in different contexts. For
example, the human noun nommai 'person/people', which is either masculine or
feminine, can take the 'human' classifier -uru, the 'animate' classifier -wori 'animate',
the 'lot' classifier -ngu and the 'group of people' classifier -po injuxtaposition: 109 The speaker could also use the paucal form po-owoi-naa (cf. 4-102c in §4.4.4.1.3) to address him,
and verbal forms with a paucal subject such as taapu-r-ong-hee, pi-'-hee.
111When an NP is determined by the demonstrative or the article, the classifier usually chooses the
bound form of the same determiner, as in 4-20. In such cases, the demonstrative functions either
deictically or anaphorically, and the article anaphorically. cf. Ch 6. However, it can take other
morphemes, e.g. the 'number one' numeral as in 4-21, which give additional information about the
entity referred to by the head noun. cf. Ch 8.

           ART.M     person      ART-CL.group
Note that the semantic category indicated by a classifier is never cross-referenced by
any other morpheme within or outside the NP. In the above examples, the inflection of
the determiner marks the gender of the noun nommai (masculine or feminine), and not
the semantic category specified by the classifier.
  Similarly, the noun moo 'coconut', which is either masculine or dimi,nv.tive, can
cooccur with five different classifiers: -ri 'nut with hard shells', - 'ri 'round object',
-mung 'plant/fruit' , -oita 'half, and mo' 'bunch of nuts'.4-21a      ong        moo        no-ri                   'this/that one coconut (nut with hard

           DEM.M      coconut    one-CL.round.object
    c      oi         moo        no-mung                 'this/that one (small) coconut
           DEM.DIM coconut       one-CL.fruit/plant      (fruit or tree)'    d      hoo        moo        no-ita                  'one half of a coconut shell'
           ART.M      coconut    one-CL.half
    e      tii        moo        no-mo'                  'one bunch of (small) coconuts'
           ART.DIM coconut       one-CL.bunch.of.nuts
Here again, the inflection of the determiner indicates the gender of the noun moo
(masculine or diminu.tive), and not the semantic category specified by the classifier.
  See Ch 8 for further examples and discussion.

4.4.1 Common Nouns
  Common nouns can be determined by the article and/or the demonstrative. Common
nouns can take any kinds of attributes such as adjectives, Possessors, relative clauses,
etc. (cf. Ch 10). Nouns in local and manner genders are not included in this class.","[103, 104, 105]"

  In this chapter, I will discuss the paradigms of verbs in the following order:
(1) In§ 13.2, I will discuss the paradigms of cross-referencing S markings of intransi-
    tive verbs, in combination with the negative infix, TAM suffixes, and gender or
    switch-reference markings. I will discuss the paradigm of S0 verbs ( § 13 .2.1), SA
    verbs (§13.2.2), irregular verbs (§13.2.3), and middle verbs (§13.2.4) in tum. In
    § 13.2.5, the cross-referencing markings of intransitive verbs of all types are
    summarised.
(2) In §13.3, the paradigms of transitive verbs are discussed and summarised in the
    same way as above.
(3) In § 13.4, all verb stems are categorised according to their phonological shapes. I
    will discuss the morphophonemic processes, which affect them when they are
    combined with cross-referencing markings.",[314]

  Attributes are defined as modifying constituents within the noun phrase, except for
the determiner(s). Attributes can be classified as follows:
(1) Pre-head attributes:
     (i) the restrictive adverb roki 'just'.
     (ii) the restrictive adverb me eng 'exactly, right'.

(5) The ending of the so-called emotive interjections (§9.6) is characterised by a level
high pitch. The last word of a declarative sentence may also be uttered in the same kind
of level high pitch, with a long pause after that. In Figure 2-17 in page 37, the last
word of the first sentence haarokuung is pronounced almost in a falsetto tone, after
which the speaker deliberately suspends the utterance of the following sentence (for one
and half second) to draw the attention of the addressee. The latter sentence describes an
event which is crucially related to the event described by the previous sentence. 29

2.9      ORTHOGRAPHY
     I follow the orthography adopted by Oliver (1955: xxii) except for /ng/, which he
transcribes as ""IJ"", and /w/, which he transcribes as ""v"".
     In the orthography in Bible translations, the Catholic missions tend to use ""j"" ,30
while the United Church ""y"", 31 for /j/. Both ""r"" and ""d"" are used for /r/. 32
     I use /j/ for the back glide because: ( 1) ""j"" seems to represent the allophonic range of
this phoneme better than ""y"" (cf. §2.2.4), and (2) ""y"" is confusingly used to represent a
non-phonemic transitional glide [j] which is heard after Iii and before a non-high vowel
(cf. Rule 2-8 in §2.3).
     On the other hand, I use the symbol /w/ for the labial glide. This symbol seems to be
well-established among native speakers, 33 although it is also confusingly used to
30
     as in So Gosipeli Maka (1952).
31
     as in So wasiih mirahu Matiu ki kehurung (1968).
32
   So wasiih mirahu Matiu ki kehurung (1968) also uses ""b"", ""j"", ""g"", ""v"" and ""1"" for loanwords
(especially in personal names or place names).
33   All my informants use ""w"" for the labial glide, while some use ""y"" and others ""j"" for the palatal
glide. Gasaway ( 1987b) reccomends ""w"" and ""y"".
38                                                                               Chapter 2represent non-phonemic [w] after /u/ and before a non-high vowel (cf. Rule 2-8 in
§2.3).
 I use only ""r"" for /r/ because [d] is clearly a free allophone of /r/ which occur in
restricted phonological environments (cf. Rule 2-6 in §2.2.5).

   Words in Motuna are classified into the following categories on morphosyntactic
criteria:
(1) Major Word Classes
      (i) Noun (cf. Ch 4)
      (ii) Adjective (cf. Ch 7)
      (iii) Verb (cf. Ch 12)
      (iv) Participle (cf. Ch 16)
(2) Minor Word Classes
      (i) Pronoun (cf. Ch 5)
      (ii) Article (cf. Ch 6)
      (iii) Demonstrative (cf. Ch 6)
      (iv) Classifier (cf. Ch 8)
      (v) Numeral (cf. Ch 8)
      (vi) Quantifier (cf. Ch 8)
      (vii) Adverb (cf. Ch 7)
      (viii) Discourse Marker (cf. Ch 9)
      (ix) Negator (cf. Ch 9)
      (x) Conjuncion (cf. Ch 9)
      (xi) Interjection (cf. Ch 9)
  Verbal nouns --- a subclass of nouns --- are discussed in Ch 16.
  The words which belong to major word classes primarily function as the heads of
phrases (noun phrases, adjective phrases, verb phrases, and participle phrases, respec-
tively). Phrases are syntactic units which constitute clauses (cf. §3.2).

      word classes -at~t,            all the others. Some of them function as substitutes for,
or modifiers of, major syntactic units. Others carry out various syntactic and pragmatic
functions.
  Motuna is predominantly an agglutinative language. It is often the case that a word
contains one or more bound morphemes. In addition, there are various types of
40                                                                                       Chapter 3compounds and syntactic constructions. For example, kinship terms and classifiers are
bound lexical roots, which are combined with various bound morphemes and/or
words.","[65, 66, 67, 68, 69]"
"
    As mentioned in §3.2.1, verbs consist of the following morphological elements.
1) verb stems,
2) bound morphemes which cross-reference the person and number of core
       argument(s),
3) tense/aspect/mood (hence TAM) suffixes, and
1 Note that ""medial verbs"" do not necessarily occupy the medial positions of sentences; they may
even stand as the heads of separate sentences, cf. § 17.1. Some ""non-medial verbs"", on the other hand,
may function as the heads of dependent embedded clauses, and in such cases they may occupy sentence-
medial positions.
2   Themes often coincide with the grammatical subjects (S or A) of the verbs, but not always, cf.
§ 17 .1. Although ""same/different theme"" are more appropriate labels than ""same/different subject"" for
medial verbal endings, I use the latter terminology in this thesis, following the convention of the
grammatical description of Papuan languages.
3   More precisely, ""controlling clauses"". cf. § 15.4.1.
256                                                                              Chapter 124a) fully inflected non-medial verbs further cross-reference the genders of topical
      arguments,
4b) other non-medial verbs have no additional markings, and
4c) medial verbs mark switch-reference.","[284, 285]"

1.5 SCOPE OF STUDY AND LANGUAGE DATA    This grammar of Motuna is based on narrative texts, most of which were provided
by two main female informants, Dora Leslie from Kaakotokori village, and Therese
Minitong Kemelfield from Panakee village. They are native speakers of the standard7 Basic voice distinction may well be a typological feature common to most Non-Austronesian
languages in Bougainville. It is attested in Nasioi (middle voice corresponds to ""reflexive"" in Hurd and
Hurd 1966, 1970), in Nagovisi (middle voice corresponds to ""reflexive"" in Hunt and Hunt 1973) and in
Konua (middle voice corresponds to ""passive and reflexive"" in MUller 1954). The existence o~distinct
""reflexive"" category in Buin verbs is also suggested in Wurm (1975: 794).
6                                                                                Chapter 1Motuna. Both ofthem are in their forties. They speak English and Tok Pisin fluently,
and apart from these languages, Dora speaks her father's language Roviana (Austrone-
sian) in the Solomon Islands, and Therese her first husband's language Tinputz
(Austronesian) in Bougainville. They also speak neighbouring Non-Austronesian
languages such as Nagovisi and Buin to some extent.
    There are other texts by two elderly speakers, Sirou Korikee (female) and Puuwa
Paurarai (male) from Haarii village, which were recorded by Therese when she was
herself collecting narratives and accounts of Siwai tradition from old people.
    In all, my main corpus consists of twenty-three texts, in total duration of 138
minutes. As mentioned in § 1.2, there is very little dialectal variation among these
texts. The texts (I), (VIII) and (XVII) are given in Appendix for illustration. This
grammar is inductively formulated by examining the language data in these texts.
    In addition, I use three texts of the Pouko dialect obtained from Agnes Kennedy (in
her thirties) for supplement. The reason why I did not use these texts in the same way
as the main texts mentioned above is that the Pouko dialect is quite distinct from other
dialects (cf. §1.2). The former are also characterised by many more loanwords and
incomplete sentences than the latter.
    There are four more recorded
                           .
                                 texts.
                                    .
                                        Two of them are recorded from the telephone
conversation of Therese with another Motuna speaker. One is a free conversation
between Therese and her three daughters. And the last one is a personal history told by
a male speaker, Alex Dawuia (in his forties), from Mamangota village. All these texts
are characterised by loanwords from English and Tok Pisin, and loose conversational
style with lots of incomplete sentences. Sentences and vocabulary (especially loan-
words) found in these texts are occasionally used to illustrate particular aspects of the
grammar.
    Four short conversational texts, and a collection of 166 short sentences, written by
Dora Leslie, are also used to illustrate some grammatical points.
    All the examples cited from the above-mentioned data are identified at the end of
English translation in brackets. For example, (XI-13) indicates that it is taken from the
thirteenth sentence of the text (XI). If there is no number in brackets, the given
example is from elicitation. All the elicited examples were checked carefully by the two
main informants. Gaps in some areas of grammar --- especially in the paradigms of
nouns, classifiers and verbs --- are checked through elicitation. They were also
checked carefully by my two main informants.
    The main aim of this grammar is to present major characteristics of this language for
language typologists and linguists in general. It is not exhaustive, but it covers all the
grammatical aspects found in the narrative texts mentioned above. I give examples
quite generously whenever I discuss important grammatical P?ints. Sometimes the

same example in different chapters is referred to in the text or in brackets after the data
identification number.
  Some aspects of the grammar --- such as the paradigms of numeral classifiers, the
use of the agentless passive construction --- are incomplete. These areas of grammar,
as well as detailed analysis of complex sentences and discourse organisation, investiga-
tion for sociolinguistic variation and genetic relationship with neighbouring languages,
are left for further research.

                                              noun Kirismas 'Christmas' and the derived

                                              riih-arei 'to become (verbal noun)'    kuma=kuma=nong=nga-wah                    'giggler' (derived from kuma=kuma 'laugh',

  Syntactic constructions, on the other hand, are not lexical units. Their meanings are
predictable from the meanings of the c!{amrnatical) words in particular syntactic con-
figurations. Examples:    nii-nno         koro=koro       noi-ngung
    [me-COMIT       language        one]-pl
    '(those) who have one language with me'    hoo         kongsi'        haaro'-ki-no-mori
    [ART.M      mango          fall.3S-HABPAST]-LINK-CL.season
    'the season when mangoes fall'
  The first example above is a so-called bahuvrihi compound with the numeral noi,
incorporating its NP argument (cf. §7.1.3 and §8.2.2.1.1). Three grammatical words,
nii-nno, koro=koro and noi-ngung, constitute a single grammatical unit. The second
example is a classifier construction, in which the classifier -mori is combined with an
intransitive verb with its S argument via the linker -no- (cf. §8.1.3 .2.5). Here again,
three grammatical words, hoo, kongsi' and haaro'-ki-no-mori, constitute a single
grammatical unit. I will hereafter associate such grammatical units by square brackets
in the interlinear text, as is shown in the above examples.

    ACROSS MORPHEME BOUNDARIES     In this section I will overview four important phonemic and morphophonemic
processes, which occur across morpheme boundaries. They are (1) assimilation, (2)
dissimilation, (3) articulation and (4) dearticulation. They occur very frequently in both
nominal and verbal morphology.","[57, 58, 59]"

2.3 VOWELS     Motuna has a typical five vowel system.
   Among the vowels, lol is most susceptible to the influence of adjacent vowels, and
Ia! most stable (cf. §2.7.1, §4.4.4 and Ch 13). The vowel lol is also by far the most
commonly used among the five vowels. In three texts (1, VI, and XXIII), chosen at
random, by three different speakers, lol accounts for 34%, while Iii, Ia!, lui and lei
account for 24%, 18%, 17%, and 7% respectively.
  Motuna has many types of vowel sequences, including two identical vowels in
succession. In any vowel sequence, each member behaves independently from other
members as far as stress and prefixing reduplication are concerned (cf. §2.4.2).
Therefore, there seems to be no motivation to assume that Motuna has phonernically
any long vowels or diphthongs.
  Single vowels and sequences of two identical vowels 15 show surface contrasts in all
environments except in open disyllabic words. Motuna has no open monosyllabic15 Oliver ( 1955) does not distinguish between single short vowels and sequences of two short vowels.

       tuurong               'he/she hit him'
       narang                'ten'
       naraang               'one limb'
       pih                   'bamboo container, you/they (two) have already gone'
       piih                  'canarium almond'
       pana                  'his wife'
       panaa                 'ancestress'
but:
       mii                   'name, knee, I have already gone'
       (*mi)
       nee                   'O.K.?, we (inclusive)'
       (*ne)
  There are, however, reasons to assume that sequences of two identical vowels in
some open disyllabic words underlyingly constitute just single vowels.
  In Motuna, the article and most personal pronouns have CVV forms when they are in
absolutive case. However, when they take the ergative suffix /-ki/, some of them retain
the original two identical vowels, while others take single ones. For example,

  The last two examples are particularly interesting. The article in feminine, dimunitive
or dual-paucal gender has the same form as that in local gender, in absolutive case.
However, their forms are different in ergative case.
  In the above cases, morphological analysis will be simpler if we assume that the
difference of surface vowel length in ergative case comes from that of the underlying

     The following phonological rule forces the underlying vowels of open mono-syllabic
words to surface as a sequence of two identical vowels:
       Rule 2-7               Vowel Lengthening of Underlying Open Mono-syllabic Words
                       vi -> vyi 1 #(C) _ #     In addition to sequences of two identical vowels mentioned above, Motuna allows
many types of sequences of two or more vowels. All the combinations attested so far
are given below:
1) Sequences of two vowels (include all the sequences which end with /if, lui and /a/):
                       /ail, /ui/, /ei/, /oil
                       /au/, !iu/, /eu/, lou/
                       lial, !ual, leal, loaf
                       /io/
16   There are other pieces of evidence which support this assumption:
( 1) all singular personal pronouns, in their bound forms, take short vowels, while nonsingular
pronouns take long vowels. This applies to possessive and reflexive pronouns as well. cf. Tables 4-7,
5-3 and 5-4.
(2) When the emphatic suffix /-ko/ is attached, only the vowel of the masculine form of the article, hoo
-sao, can optionally be shortened (cf. §9.3).
  As regards other mono-syllabic words with long vowels, there are no reason to assume that they
have different underlying forms, since the forms with short vowels never occur. They include:
                    maa 'faeces', haa 'thing, I wonder', mii 'name, knee, before I have gone',jii 'and', tuu
                    'water', kuu 'inside', nee 'O.K.?', noo 'possibly'

    verbal forms, but others are found only in a few words):
           /aai/, /uuil, /eei/, /ooi/

2.4.1 Syllable Structure
     The syllable structure of Motuna is represented as:

     C 1 can be any consonant except /HI, /Q/ and IN/. C 2 can be either /HI, /Q/ or IN/.
As we have seen in §2.3, all vowel sequences are analysed as sequences of single
vowels, which constitute the nuclei of separate syllables.
     C 2 consonants are not followed by a vowel. 17 Now, the underlying forms of some
suffixes may have an archinasal at the beginning. 1 8 When such a suffix is attached to a
word ending with a C 2 , 19 C 2 must be ""articulated"" to a C 1V sequence, in order to avoid
an unperrnissible C 2 N sequence. cf. §2.7.3.","[47, 48, 49, 50, 51]"
"     4.4.3. Proper Names
       Proper names can be in masculine, feminine or local gender. Those in local gender
     refer to places. They can be included in the subclass of local nouns.
       Personal names in masculine gender either refer to male persons (as Tantanu in 4-79)
     or to collective entities (as Keehno in 4-80). When they refer to collective entities, they
     are cross-referenced by paucal/plural number markings on the verb, but they never take
     number suffixes on themselves.
88                                                                                           Chapter 44-79            Tantanu-ki                 roki    noh-u-r-u-ng:

                ' ... the Keehnos used to live in the village.' (XI-1)
   As is seen in 4-80, proper names can be determined by the article and/or the demon-
strative. Furthermore, those in local gender often take attributes such as LD nouns,
possessive pronouns, etc. For example, the proper (place) name Aaru in the following
example is determined by the article and the demonstrative in local gender, and is
further modified by two LD nouns raang 'north' and koto 'up':4-81            ... tii       owo       raang     koto       Aalu           mi-i-na.

                '... I went to Alu up in the north.' (XV-39)
   As is shown in 4-81, place names are usually treated as local nouns by themselves.
In some cases, however, the derivational suffix -kori (or its allomorph -ngori or -jori,
cf. §4.6.1) is attached to them, in order to clearly indicate their local gender. For
example:4-82           ... tii          Maato-ngori            uwi-ro ...
                    ART.L       'river.name'-L         go.3pcl.S-PERF.SS
                '... they went to (the River) Maato, and (they) .. .' (XXIII-4)
  Local nouns derived by the suffix -kori may be lexicalised as place names. For
example, the village from which one of my informants comes is called Kaakoto-kori
'white-L [lit. white-place]'. 154. 4. 4. Kinship Terms
  There are two kinds of kinship terms:                  bC~sic...      and dya.dic... .
       BG\slc...-         ' kinship terms consist of bound personal pronouns (Possessors), and
     basic-           kinship roots (Possessees). A bound pronoun and a kinship root are
directly combined in this order.
  ·· D'Ja.d.ic:..   kinship terms, on the other hand, consist of the bound forms of personal
pronouns, the article, the demonstrative, or the indefinite proform, and JJ.'fad\c:.. ·15 According to my informant, the name comes from the breadfruit trees in the village, which bearlots of white fruits.
Nouns                                                                                            89kinship roots. These bound morphemes and the kinship root are usually intervened by
the linker -(n)o- when they are combined.
                     , kinship terms can be determined by the article and/or the demonstra-
tive. They can also take various attributes, in the same way as common nouns do. For
example,                          kinship term nupi-ng 'my grandchildren' determined by the demon-
strative oi (in dual-paucal gender form) and modified by the LD noun raano 'north':4-83       nii       oi           raano nupi-ng                   mono-or-upee

   - t!.as\v              kinship terms can enter possessive constructions, where Possessors ""
are expanded by preceding nouns or noun phrases. Dya&:ic., _·kinship terms, on the
other hand, can enter kinship constructions, where one of the members in the kin
relations referred to by them is specified by preceding nouns. See Ch 11.
   All the kinship terms with technical definitions are listed in Table 4-5.
   In the following sections, I will discuss_                 b<~rsl~   ·and ct~avlic.., kinship terms

§4.4.4.1.4 and Table 4-11 in §4.4.4.2.3, respectively. The examples of kinship roots
given in the following sections are identified by the numbers in brackets, which refer to
the numbers given in Table 4-5.","[116, 117, 118, 119]"
"
  Cross-referencing markings indicate the person and number of one (in the case of
intransitive verbs) or two (in the case of transitive verbs) core arguments. According to
Dixon's (1979, 1994) suggestions, the following symbols will be used as the abbrevia-
tions of core arguments hereafter:
Syntactic Preview                                                                                43       the subject of an intransitive verb               s
       the subject of a transitive verb                   A
       the object of a transitive verb                   0
Complements of verbs, on the other hand, are indicated by the symbol ""C"".
     Verbal markings which cross-reference the person/number of S, A and 0 NPs, are
also labelled asS, A and 0 markings respectively.
     In most cases sentential topics are one of the core arguments, but not always.
Peripheral NPs in absolutive or ergative case, with local nouns as their heads, can 'also
be topics.","[71, 72]"
"
    The verbal morphology of Motuna is extremely complex. All the verbs mark the
person and number of core argument(s)- S, in the case of intransitive verbs, and 0 and
A, in the case of transitive verbs. They also distinguish active and middle voices,
similar to those found in classical Indo-Aryan languages. 7 A periphrastic agentless
passive construction is formed by participles and the auxiliary 'to become', which""is
mainly used when the speaker addresses or refers to someone in a special kin relation.
    Similar to many other Papuan languages, Motuna has ""medial"" verbs which usually
occupy sentence-medial positions and are marked by switch-reference morphemes.
The endings of fully inflected ""non-medial"" verbs, on the other hand, mark the gender
of the topical argument of the sentence.
    Motuna has an extensive tense/aspect/mood system. Non-medial verbs distinguish
fourteen tense/aspect/mood categories, while medial verbs distinguish three for the
same subject forms, and two for the different subject forms.
    As for derivational morphology, verb stems may undergo four valency-changing
processes--- stimulative, applicative, causative and reciprocal. They can also derive
verbal nouns and participles.",[34]

  In all the examples found in my corpus, Possessors are a 3rd person singular
possessive pronoun po-kong expanded by noun phrases (cf. 3-7 5), or verbal clauses

(1) Active and middle voice. They are distinguished by different sets of S/A/0 cross-
       referencing bound morphemes. Motuna also has a periphrastic passive construe;...
       tion (cf. § 16.3.4).
(2) Medial and non-medial verbs. I call the verbs which mark switch-reference ""medial
       verbs"", while those which don't ""non-medial verbs"".' Switch-reference mark-
       ings indicate whether the ""themes"" 2 of the medial verbal clauses are the same as,
       or are different from, those of the following clauses. 3 Fully inflected non-medial
       verbs, on the other hand, cross-reference the genders of the sentential topics.
(3) Fourteen TAM categories for non-medial verbs, and three for the same subject
       forms and two for the different subject forms of medial verbs.
(4) Verb stems may be underived or derived. Derived stems may take one or more of
       the four valency changing suffixes --- stimulative, applicative, causative and
       reciprocal.","[282, 283, 284]"

    SA person suffixes ---1-o(C)/, 1-opil and /-oN/ (1st), 1-il (2nd), and 1-u/ and /-wal
(3rd) --- are identical in form with, and undergo the same morphophonemic changes as,
A person suffixes in transitive verbs. Thus, in the morphophonemic analysis below,
they are simply called ""A suffixes"".
    Note that the initial/w/ of the 3rd person paucallplural A suffix /-wal is dropped after
a consonant. See Rule 13-16b in §13.4.1. Nonsingular number may be expressed by
a person suffix (/-oN/ for 1st paucallplural and /-wal for 3rd paucallplural), or by an
additional number suffix /-til (dual) or 1-ru/ (paucallplural).
    Inclusive/exclusive distinction does not exist in A cross-referencing suffixes. 9
    The full paradigm of the SA verb /mon-/ 'to look', with all the TAM suffixes listed in
Table 13-2, the negative infix /-woo-/, and masculine/feminine/dual-paucal gender
suffixes in Table 13-3, is discussed below. I will not make comments on the morpho-
phonemic processes which have already been discussed in § 13.2.1. The realisation of
1st person A suffixes is highly irregular; it is summarised in §13.2.2.15.                Note that
the vowel/of .of the stem is assimilated to the following a due to Rule 2-9a.","[327, 328]"

Examples:(1) ""active-middle"" stems:

        b      /pokuk-/ in active voice: 'to hide sb/sth'
                         in middle voice: 'to hide (oneself)', 'to be hidden'

            ----------------
18According to my informants, some derived verb stems with the causative or the applicative suffix
can also take middle suffixes. However, there are no examples of such verbs in my corpus.
19   See examples in §14.3.1.1 and §14.3.1.2.

             /ruQkaHw-/ 'to do the cooking'            /nimautu-/ 'to look handsome (male)'12.3.2 Verbs with Active Pronominal Markings and Transitivity
   In active voice, verbs cross-reference one or two core argument NPs. The verbs
which take only one core argument (S), such as /siiho-/ 'to become/be ill', /kumar-/ 'to
laugh', and /pi(h)-/ 'to go', are intransitive verbs. On the other hand, those with two
core arguments (0 and A), such as /ngo-/ 'to make/do sth, to do (sth) to sb', /to-/ 'to
hit/kill sb/sth', /o-1 'to give (sth) to sb', /nai-/ 'to show (sth) to sb', are transitive
verbs. 20
     All the transitive verbs are marked by a set of pronominal suffixes, which usually
consist of an 0 suffix, an A suffix, and a number suffix, in that order. See the follow-
ing example:/mono-/ 'to see/look at' as a transitive verb (cf. 12-5. The dual suffix is fused with the
following Near Past suffix):12-17           noni       nee         ho-i            Hanging            mono-m-u-h-ni.

             '... Honging must have seen us two.' (XII-9)
20 There are, however, cases where we cannot decide the transitivity of particular verb stems simply in
terms of cross-referencing markings. See § 14.2.

--- S0 personumber suffixes, SA person number suffixes, and consonant alternation of
              /'.

  I call the verbs which take the suffixes of the first type ""S 0 verbs"", those with the
suffixes of the second type ""SA verbs"", and the last type ""irregular verbs"". Examples:the S0 verb /haa-/ 'to want/agree' (cf. 12-6):12-18      .. . tii           uri        pih-arei-ko            haa-mu-ki-na .

           'You, the devil, will not laugh.'                    (VIII-14)
the irregular verb /pi(h)-/ 'to go' (cf. 12-8):12-20      jeewo?        roo-ko                     woo-ki          p i-i=ta-na?

           'How (is it)? Which way are you going?' (XIV-15)
  Among the three types of intransitive verbs mentioned above, SA verbs are the largest
in number. The majority of SA verbs denote volitional activities, but some of them
denote uncontrollable events (such as /haarok-/ 'to fall') or processes (such as
/hoNnak-/ 'to grow up').
  Only twenty-odd S0 verbs (including those found in elicitation sessions) have been
attested, which are all semantically characterised as ""Patient- or Experiencer-oriented"".
  There are only five irregular verbs. They are semantically heterogenous, and are all
high frequency items.
  Verb stems in each class are exemplified below. More comprehensive lists of S0 and
SA verbs are given in §14.3.1.1 and §14.3.1.2, respectively.

              /puu(h)-/ 'to die'
              /paa(h)-/ 'to cry'12.3.3 Verbs with Middle Pronominal Markings
  Verbs in middle voice cross-reference only one argument; thus they are regarded as
intransitive verbs. Although there are many verb forms with middle suffixes which can
take two arguments, the subject arguments of such verbs cannot usually take the
ergative case suffix. 21
     The common semantic characteristic of verbs in middle voice is that they denote
events/activities, which centre on only one, and no other, participant. If the denoted
event/activity is agentive, that sole participant is the affected entity. 22 If it is non-
agentive, that participant is simply the Undergoer of the whole event.
     As mentioned in § 12.3 .1, the following two types of stems can take middle suffixes:
(1) active-middle stems which can take both active and middle suffixes, and
(2) middle-only stems which can take only middle suffixes.","[294, 295, 296, 297]"

(3) The emphatic adverb roki=manni 'really' derives from the restrictive adverb roki
'just' and the conjunction manni 'so'. It is placed before the constituent it modifies. It
can modify adjectives (7-49), adverbs (7-50), verbs (7-51) and participles (7-47):

  Locations and directions are mostly expressed by nouns, pronouns, the local article
or demonstrative. They may also be expressed by adverbial phrases. The suffix
-(no)ning 'towards' can be attached to local nouns to derive locational/directional
adverbs. See §7.2.6.
 · Temporal concepts can be expressed by words belonging to other word classes than
adverbs, such as local nouns or article, some classifier constructions, adverbial phras-
es, or dependent verbal clauses. The following few temporal adverbs have been found
in my corpus:

         THE 'ALL' QUANTIFIER8.1 CLASSIFIERS
8.1.1 Introduction
   Classifiers are bound morphemes. They are combined with the bound forms of the
article, the demonstrative, possessive pronouns, numerals, the 'all' quantifier, etc., to
constitute classifier constructions of various types. Classifier constructions in Motuna
cover the functions of so-called numeral classifiers, demonstrative classifiers and
genitive classifiers in other languages (cf. Craig 1994). Classifiers can also be com-
bined with free nouns, adjectives, and verbal and participle clauses. Motuna employs
the same classifying morphemes in all these constructions. The morpho-syntactic
behaviour of classifiers and classifier constructions is summarised as follows:
Morphologically,
(1) classifiers are directly combined with the bound forms of:
       (i) the demonstrative o-,
       (ii) the article ti-,
       (iii) the 'other' muuko-,
       (iv) the bound interrogative pronounjee- 'what',
       (v) some adjectives,
       (vi) numerals, and
       (vii) the 'all' quantifier.","[187, 188, 189, 190, 191]"
"3.2.2.1      Absolutive NPs
   The heads of absolutive noun phrases can be in any gender. Absolutive NPs with
the head nouns/pronouns in local and manner genders behave differently from those
with the head noun/pronouns in other genders.
   Absolutive NPs, with the heads in other genders than local and manner, function as:
1) arguments and predicates in nominal clauses. e.g.:3-3         ree-mo                poko-ng                            Emmai.

                          Argument             ]                     [Predicate]
            'Your father's name is Emmai.' (XIII -65)
2) arguments in adjectival clauses. e.g.:3-4         hoo        poti             roki=manni         mirahu.
            ART.M      time             certainly          good
            [ Argument ]                         [Predicate]
            'That time was certainly good.' (XXX-99)
3) subjects (Ss) in intransitive verbal or participle clauses. They usually function as
sentential topics. 5 e.g.:3-5         roo        hoo              huhu-ro-i=to-ng.
            you.sg     ART.M            tell.a.lie-MID .2S-PRESPROG-M

            ' You are telling a lie.' (XIX-33)
5 Unless another NP denoting location or destination functions as a topic. cf. 3-13, 3-14, 3-19 and3-34 below.
46                                                                                          Chapter 34) subjects (As), and objects (Os), in transitive verbal (or participle) clauses. e.g.:3-6           nee                poti       ihkita         nop-upi-n-ni.

              'We Cpaucal inclusive) took(= spent) a long time.' (XV -29)
Note that A NPs in absolutive case usually function as sentential topics, 6 in contrast
with those in ergative case which do not.","[74, 75]"

15.1      INTRODUCTION    Motuna has (1) ten non-medial TAM suffixes which are followed by gender suf3
fixes, (2) five non-medial TAM suffixes which are not followed by them, and (3) five
medial 1 TAM suffixes. All the TAM suffixes are listed in Tables 12-3a- c in this
order.
    TAM suffixes may express different meanings when they are combined with differ-
ent types of verbs. For example, the Perfect suffix, when combined with stative verbs
such as tu(h)- 'to be' or tuh-ee- 'to have', indicates a present state ('is/are' or 'have'),
while when combined with action verbs such as pi(h)- 'to go' or terminative verbs such
as patak- 'to arrive', it expresses an event which took place or terminated yesterday or
before and has some relevance to the present situation ('went, have/has gone' or
'(have/has) arrived'). Thus the names of TAM suffixes should be regarded only as
labels.
    As mentioned in Ch 13, all the TAM suffixes/categories are indicated by capital
letters. For example, ""definite future TAM"" will be written simply as ""Definite Fu-
ture"".","[462, 463, 464]"

§2.2.5. I will use [r] in the examples below where this distinction is irrelevant.s See §2.6 for more precise definitions of different types of morpheme boundaries in Motuna.

aspectual verb. In either case, the two morphemes are separate words both on phono-
logical and syntactic grounds, although they constitute a tight syntactic unit. Phono-
logically, a pause can be made after the first morpheme and stress may fall on each
morpheme separately in slow speech, although the two morphemes are more likely to
be pronounced in one string with only one stress on the third from the last mora of the
second one (cf. §2.5 and §2.6). Syntactically, another word may intervene between
the two.

         homonymous with the local noun tii-nohno 'that.time-length' (cf. §4.4.2.6).
            I regard them as subordinating conjunctions because the syntactic behaviour of medial clauses
         introduced by them diffe~from that of other medial clauses. The former always occupy the initial
         positions of sentences, and cannot stand as separate sentences on their own. (In this respect their
         behaviour is similar to that of protases in Imaginative. cf. 17-3.) The latter, on the other hand, can be
         placed after or within the controlling clauses, and can stand as separate sentences on their own. See the
         discussion below and in § 17 .2.
         3 This sentence has no controlling clause. The continuous SS form noh-u-i expresses a durative
         event going on at the reference point of time understood from the context. See the discussion of
         examples 17-15-17-17 below.
506                                                                                          Chapter 17  Dependent embedded clauses introduced by tii may also function as post-head
attributes:17-10         ngo-ng         rumaru tii        nii pehkita honnang-o-mo                nu-ku ---

              'My life when I was small and was growing up ---' (11-0)
  In most cases, however, medial verbal clauses function as dependent non-embedded
clauses. Switch-reference markings track the ""theme"" of the discourse (cf. Roberts
1988b).
  In Motuna, ""theme"" and ""topic"" are two distinct categories. As exemplified inCh 3,
""topic"" is a focal NP argument (usually in absolutive case) in a clause. In a verbal
clause it could be A, 0, S, or a local argument, and is cross-referenced by the gender
suffix on the non-medial verb. It does not control switch-reference operation.17-11         tiko tii       kongsi'-ko        poo'            patak-a-ro                manni

              say .to-30.3pcl.A-RMPAST-F
              'And after they had arrived at the underneath of the mango tree, they said
              to her: "" ... ""' (VIII-11)
In 17-11, the topic of the clause with the non-medial verb nah-a-a-na is the 0 argument
'her', which is cross-referenced by the feminine ending -na on the same verb. The
topic of the preceding medial verb patak-a-ro may be the S argument 'they' or the local
argument tii kongsi'-ko poo' 'at the underneath of the mango tree', neither of which is
coreferential with the topic of this controlling clause. If the topic were to control the
switch-reference operation, we would expect that this medial verb would be marked by
the DS suffix -ku. But in fact it is marked by the SS suffix -ro.
  As is shown in the above example, switch-reference is usually sensitive to the
coreference of SfA arguments, as in other Papuan languages, and not to the coreference
of clausal topics as defined above. However, there are also many instances where
medial verbs are in the same subject forms even though S/A are not coreferential. e.g.:17-12         tiko   hoo       oi         P.                  o-no-ori'                pee-mo

              'And P. and her sisters' father returned, and then, I was certainly trans
              ferred.' (XVI-40, cf.11-14)
Interclausal Relations                                                                                  507Here the referent of the S of turu-woo-ro (the narrator's husband) and that of the
controlling verb tini-mon-na (the narrator herself) are different. They are regarded,
however, as parts of the same referential framework which includes all the members of
the narrator's family living and moving together.
    It is clear from the above example that switch-reference does not operate within the
boundaries of a sentence, but is a thematic operation which essentially identifies the
frame of that particular discourse with that of the adjacent discourse. It is true that S/A
are the major components of such framework in that if they are the same or their
referents overlap, medial verbs are always in the same subject forms. But the spe3ker
can also regard different participants referred to by S/A arguments as belonging to the
same group for discourse reasons, as in 17-12.","[534, 535, 536]"

  The discourse marker nee 'it must be-, O.K.?' indicates that the speaker wants to
confirm that his/her information or idea is shared with the addressee. (The speaker may
address him- or herself, as in 9-7).
  The first syllable ne of nee is always pronounced with a high pitch, which is fol-
lowed by a sharp falling contour in the second syllable e. cf. §2.8.9-7        ih!        nii       nee            mara-nno            konn-opi-h=nuto-ng.

           (XI-21)9.1.5     nehe 'do you agree?'
  The discourse marker nehe is similar to nee both in meaning and syntactic behaviour.
  Nee signals that the speaker is quite sure that his/her idea is shared with the ad-
dressee, and he/she is only confirming it. In the case of nehe 'do you agree?', on the
other hand, the speaker is not so sure about it.
  As is the case with nee, the first syllable of nehe is always pronounced with a high
pitch, which is followed by a sharp falling contour in the second syllable he. cf. §2.8.9-9        ... hoo          mara           hoo-jori       ti-weena      tuh-ah   nehe

     The discourse marker ai 'I tell you' signals that the speaker is going to tell the
addressee a fact, or his/her own idea. It can be placed anywhere in a sentence, but
most frequently after the sentential topic.9-11           nii       az                rumanung-ngung-ngi                uko-m-a-a-ng.

     The interjection ai 'or' is homonynous with this discourse marker. cf. 9.5.4.9.1.7 noo 'possibly, may I ask?, take'
  The discourse marker noo 'possibly, may I ask?' is often used in interrogative
sentences (as in 9-13 and 9-14). In a sentence consisting of noo and a noun phrase, the
speaker asks the addressee to take the object referred to by the noun phrase (as in
9-15). 29-13           tiitii.         tuu         noo           no-'ra                      tuh-ee-n-na-na?

I do not know how to interpret noo in this sentence. It seems to be somehow related to the noo
discussed above, but I cannot pinpoint the common semantic component at this stage.

  The discourse marker poko 'there's no other way, had better' always occupies the
second position in a sentence. It signals that the speaker is forced to accept a certain
situation, or the necessity of a certain action. The speaker signals the end of a conver-
sation or show the agreement to the other's proposal, by using poko in set phrases with
mirahu 'good' (as in 9-16) and oso 'O.K.' (as in 9-17b).9-16       mirahu poko                           manni.          urisih-i-woro.

  Meekuhing/meekusing (h and s are in free variation) can function as an adjective,
with the meaning 'true':9-20          jeewo?         hoo          koro=koro       taaro-onno-ng                noo

9.2 THE NEGATOR toku    Toku can function either as the negator of verbs, adjectives, adverbs or participles.
It is placed immediately before the element it negates. 3
as the negator of a verbal predicate:
9-23       toku     huhu-mo-i-na.
              not        be.wrong-MID.IS-NRPAST-F
              'I was not wrong.' (I-31)
as the negator of an adjectival predicate:
9-24       nii     toku naa'ru.
              I        not         lazy
              'I am not lazy.' (XIX-50)
3   Unless it is intervened by a conjunction or a discourse marker. e.g. nah-ah and roruki in 9-69b.

           '... she will encouter hardships [lit. the way of life which is not good].'
           (XXI-11)
as the negator of an adverb:

           'And the bamboo container did not become full quickly.' (XI-9)
  When it is placed before a ""number one"" classifier noi or no- (cf. §8.2.2.1), it
denotes a total negation:9-27       misi-ko                                                totu '-ki-ng.

           'I am not looking at anyone.' (X-29)
  The adverbs meero 'yet' and runni 'very' always occur in negative sentences in
combination with toku:9-29       toku        meero mohkoruuk-u-i=to-ng.
           not         yet          approach-30.3A-PRESPROG-M

           '... while they were not believing it vezy much, (they) .. .' (III-56)
   Toku can also function as a discourse marker, expressing a negative thought or
feeling of the speaker about the event described in the sentence. In such a case it is
placed at the beginning of the sentence (as in 9-31), or after a sentential topic (as in
9-32), with a discourse marker which expresses the speaker's judgement (jaa 'I
wonder' in 9-31 and 9-4, and nee 'it must be' in 9-32).9-31             toku        paa        jaa         turong-ung-heemee'ko-ng?

9.3    THE EMPHATIC SUFFIX /-ko/
  The emphatic suffix /-ko/ can be attached to any word except for interjections. It can
modify a particular word, phrase, clause or sentence. It singles out the element it is
attached to.
  When it modifies a clause or a sentence, or a conjunction or a discourse marker, it
expresses the concessive meaning 'even, if only'. It can also mark two successive
clauses or sentences, with the meaning 'A, and also B'.","[225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232]"

    There is another dialect or language called Baitsi spoken in further west, around
Boku (cf. Map). Allen and Hurd (1965) refer to it as a sublanguage of ""Siwai Proper
Dialect"". However, I have no data ofthis variety.
    This thesis is based on the data provided by four informants from the central regions
of Siwai (cf. § 1.5). The data of the Pouko dialect will be mentioned wherever relevant,
but the full analysis of this dialect is left for future research.
Introduction                                                                                         31.3 PREVIOUS WORK
    The Roman Catholic and the Methodist missions started to work in the Siwai region
early in this century. Some of the missionaries studied Motuna and attempted to
translate biblical texts into Motuna. According to Allen and Hurd (1965), Rev. A. H.
Voyce, Fr. Schlieker and Pamela Beaumont translated some biblical texts and hymns.
Fr. Schlieker also worked on a elementary grammar, and Pamela Beaumont on a
dictionary. 3
                                                                                             l,
    Tn.,.dditi\JV\""lo the work done by the missionaries, American anthropologist Douglas
Oliver (1949, 1955) describes the Siwai life and culture with rich linguistic information
based on the data collected in his first field work in 1938-39. Although he is not a
professional linguist, his phonemic transcription is fairly accurate, and the linguistic
data he provides is invaluable.
    Linguists belonging to the Summer Institute of Linguistics conducted field work on
the languages in Bougainville including Motuna. Among them, Allen and Hurd
( 1965), as mentioned above, did lexico-statical survey of all the languages in Bougain-
ville including Motuna. Gasaway ( 1987) provides lexical data of the dialects of Motuna
and Nagovisi based on her field work. She also puts forward phonological analysis of
these data.","[31, 32]"
"
     Some lexical words have dual or triple membership in different word classes. For
example, meeng functions as an adjective with masculine gender inflection in the sense
of 'real', as a restrictive adverb in the sense of 'exactly, right', or as an emphatic
adverb in the sense of 'very'. In such cases, I register them in all the word classes in
which they have membership.
     Some lexical phrases are also described in the corresponding word classes. (For
example, numerals above six in analytical constructions.) On the other hand, two
suffixes, -ko and -nno, are discussed inCh 9, together with other words belonging to
minor word classes, since their syntactic behaviour is like that of a discourse marker
and a conjunction, respectively.",[70]
"
    The major word classes are characterised as follows:
(1) Nouns have five genders in singular number--- masculine, feminine, dimunitive,
      local and, marginally, manner. Gender distinction is neutralised in nonsingular
      number. The gender of a noun is cross-referenced by the modifiers within the
      same noun phrase and/or by the predicate. In addition, most nouns can be modi-
      fied by classifiers, which relate to their semantic types.
         Nouns distinguish four numbers--- singular, dual, paucal and plural. Norwin-
      gular numbers may be marked on nouns by suffixes. The number of a noun may
      also be cross-referenced on the predicate, if it is the head of an argument NP.
         As the heads of noun phrases, nouns can be determined by the article and/or the
      demonstrative, and can take modifiers of various types, e.g. nouns, adjectives,
      classifiers, possessors, relative clauses, numerals, a quantifier, etc. Noun phrases
      fulfill various syntactic functions in different types of clauses. See §3.2.2.",[69]

     As mentioned in §8.1.1, classifiers are either directly combined with various bound
morphemes, or are combined with bound morphemes, words or clauses via the linker
-no-. The constructions of the first type are discussed in §8.1.3.1, and those with the
linker -no- in §8.1.3.2.","[194, 195, 196, 197, 198]"

3   The form -muu is used to refer only to a day in the past. For example:
              tiko    manni no-nt                no-muu       hoo     Paanaangah

In the above sentence, two classifiers are employed in a headless temporal NP in adverbial function.
(The unexpressed head is mu day'.) It seems that the classifier -muu cannot be used in headless NPs on
its own.

attributes, or are employed in headless noun phrases.","[198, 199]"

   I am a late comer in the arena of linguistics. Although I had long been interested in
·languages, I had never studied linguistics seriously until I came to Canberra in 1989.
 In that year I was taught an introduction to linguistics and sociolinguistics by Elisabeth
 Patz in the University of Canberra, as a TESOL student. Her excellent lectures deter-
 mined the direction of my study. In the following year I was enrolled in the ANU, and
 since then, I have had ample opportunities to investigate different areas of linguistics
 with the assistance of teachers, fellow students and visitors. Among them were Anna
 Wierzbicka, Phil Rose and Harold Koch, and my supervisors mentioned above. My
 debt is to all the people I encountered in the course of my linguistic studies. This thesis
 is in a way a summary of what I have learned from them in the last few years in
 Canberra.",[7]

23 The verbs which denote 'groomi.n g', such as /uuh-/ 'to wach oneself and /sii'h-/ 'to put oil on
oneself, can be interpreted this way. The meanings expressed by these verbs are characterised more as
'activities involving oneself than as 'punctual reflexive actions', and thus are close to the semantic
content expressed by the type (3) stems below.

external agent or controller. S often refers to an inanimate object (such as ""a tree which was cut
down"") or an animate entity without any scope of control (such as ""a baby"").

     The subject of the verb, both in active and middle voices, is the controller of the
described action or activity. The verb in active voice expresses a transitive action which
the Agent (A) performs towards the Patient (0), while the verb in middle voice ex-
presses the Agent's (S) activity in which the Patient is irrelevant or unspecified. In the
latter case, the verb may take an absolutive noun phrase as a Complement, which refers
to a non-specific or habitual event or activity (as in 12-31b). Examples:/taapu-/ 'to help sb' (active), 'to participate' (middle):12-30a       jeewo?      ni-ngi       noo           taavu-r-ong-kuu-ng?

     Middle-only verb stems are classified into the following three subtypes (1)'- (3)',
the semantic content of which is si;milar to that of (1)- (3), respectively, in§ 12.3.3.1:
(1)' [physical action which crucially involves one's body]
     The denoted action may be voluntary or involuntary. Examples:lkuror-/ 'to run/be at a run':12-33        nampa            kuro-roo.

Other examples:

             /turu-/                         'to return'
             */suQk-/                        'to jump'
             *lkakapi-/                      'to crawl like a caterpillar'
The verbs marked by * have transitive counterparts with causative meanings, which do
not seem to be used very often.26
     Note that /neQw-/ with middle suffixes (12-34) and /maap-/ with active (SA) suffixes
have exactly the same meaning. Similarly, /morik-/ 'to return' with active (SA) suffixes
seems to be the synonym of /turu-/ with middle suffixes ( 12-35). Which of the two
synonymous verbs in these pairs is used in a particular context largely depends on
social factors. In general, the words, whose initial syllables are identical with those of
tabooed names, are avoided. This is probably one of the major reasons why Motuna
has many pairs of synonymous words.","[298, 299, 300, 301]"
"
A morpheme boundary does not necessarily coincide with a syllable boundary.
     Phonemic and morphophonemic processes across the first two types of boundaries
""#""and""="", and those across the boundary""-"", are quite distinct from each other. The
first two types of boundaries retain the shapes of two phonemes on both sides. For
example, if two vowels are in contact across a boundary ""#"" or ""="", a phonemically
nondistinct glottal stop automatically intervenes (cf. Rule 2-2 in §2.2.1). A boundary
of the last type, on the other hand, allows the two morphemes on both sides to as-
similate, dissimilate or coalesce. See, for example, the assimilation processes dis-
cussed in §2.7.1, which only affect the boundaries of the last type.
     The boundaries marked by ""-"" are not always uniform in their phonological behav-
iour. For example, the morphophonemic processes which affect the boundaries across
various bound roots and classifiers (Ch 8) are quite different from those which affect
those across verb roots and suffixes (Ch 13).
     In Motuna, a phonological word boundary is identified according to the stress
assignment discussed in §2.5. It is also the case that a pause can be freely made across
such a boundary.
     Motuna has many types of compounds and syntactic constructions, which consist of
two or more phonological words.
     I regard lexicalised units which consist of two or more phonological words as
compounds. Compounds always behave as morpho-syntactic units; other words can
never intervene between phonological words in a compound.",[57]

13.2.2.15 Realisation of 1st Person A Suffix
  The realisation of the 1st person A suffix is as follows:
      Rule 13-12      Realisation of 1st Person A Suffix
            The following rules apply before Rules 13-1- 13-5.
            The 1st person A suffix, in singular, is combined with the following TAM
             suffixes to take various forms:             (a) {1st A} -m -> -o-m
             (b) {1st A} -k -> -ong
            (c) {1st A} -w, -h -> -op
            (d) {1st A} -r -> -oNn
            (e) {1st A} -i -> -os-i
            (f) {1st A} -juu -> -osuu
            (g) {1st A} -u -> -ot-u
            (h) {1st A} -o -> -om-o
            It is realised as /-opi/ before the dual suffix /-til:            (i) {1st A} -> -opi I_ -ti
            In paucal/plural number, it, again, takes various forms. It fuses with the /r/
            of the Perfect and Negative Optative suffixes, and /w/ of the Optative suffix
            and the negative infix. It is realised as -opi word-finally, as -opi-r10 before
            a vowel, and -oN in other environments.","[334, 335]"
"
5 For example, the 1st person singular pronoun /ni/ is realised as [ni:] when it is not followed by any
suffix. In such a case it is represented as nii in orthographic representation. cf. §2.3.
6   Unless otherwise stated, original Tok Pisin words are taken from Mihalic (1971).

          1-   k -> [+labial] I u        o
Examples:
      kiuruko [kt(i)f(j)k w 0   r                'two (humans)'
      tuko [t(Ukw o]                             'ants' nest'
The phoneme /k/ may be realised as [!J] and UJ in certain morphophonemic environ-
ments. cf. Chs 4, 5 and 6.
    The archiphoneme /Q/, realised as a glottal stop[?], occurs word-medially before a
consonant, or word-finally, but never in word initial position. I will use the symbol '
for this phoneme in orthographic representation. e.g. /tuQkil tu'ki 'all', /moniQmo/
moni'mo 'woman', /kinaaQ/ kinaa' 'yesterday', limoQ/ imo' 'my relatives'.
    A glottal stop can also be non-phonemic when it occurs as an intervening consonant
between two vowels across a phonological word boundary""="", or across a grammati-
cal word boundary ""#"" if the grammatical words on both sides constitute a syntactically
tight unit. 8 See examples below. A non-phonemic glottal stop can also occur
between two vowels across a grammatical word boundary in rapid speech, or after a
vowel-final word when the speaker makes a deliberate pause (for hesitation, looking
for a next word, etc.).","[40, 41]"
"
    Clause coordination is mainly achieved by chaining medial verbs. Medial verbs, by
their tense/aspect and switch-reference suffixes, track the themes of the whole dis-
course. Thematic coherence is further maintained by a rich array of conjunctions and
discourse markers. Due to these pragmatic factors, it is not sufficient to choose the
sentence as the linguistic unit of description, in the case of this language.",[34]

11.2 CONSTRUCTIONS AT PHRASE LEVEL
11.2.1 Kinship Constructions
  Kinship relations are expressed by single words, or by the constructions of a
head-marking type.
  As discussed in §4.4.4, there are two types of kinship terms;'       basic......· and
Cl')acllc..... .  Basic..-      kinship terms always require Possessors.

roots, and Possessors are:
      (i) bound personal pronouns, or
      (ii) 3rd person bound pronouns expanded by absolutive noun phrases.
(2) kinship constructions, in which 'cly~o\.ic...-. kinship roots are bound to:
      (i) bound personal pronouns in nonsingular forms, or
      (ii) the bound demonstrative, which cross-references preceding nouns.",[269]

"12.4.1 NominalNerbal Roots
  All the roots of this type, which have been found in my corpus, are given below.
     Note that an epenthetic /k/ is attached to the roots to formall the SA verb stems and
some transitive verb stems. (The epenthetic /k/ may optionally be realised as /ng/ under
the phonological environments specified in Rule 4-1.) If the original noun ends with
IN/, /ng/ is attached, and if it ends with /HI or /Q/, /w/ is attached, to form any type of
verb root.
     These consonants do not seem to be derivational suffixes. They are needed for
phonological reasons. The epenthetic /k/27 is necessary because SA (and A) person27   Note that the back /k/ is the commonest among the stop consonants. cf. fn 12 in §2.2.3.

assimilation will occur and the person distinction of SA/A will be obscured in some
cases. A glide is needed after IN/, /HI or /Q/, because these C 2 consonants cannot be
followed directly by a vowel due to the constraint of syllable structure (cf. §2.4.1).
     These epenthetic consonants are also attached to adjectival/verbal roots. See

28 According to these criteria, if a noun corresponds to a verb stem which ends with a consonant other
than /k/, /ng/ or /w/, it is regarded as derived from the corresponding verb. e.g. hing 'rotten juices' <-
lhiNh-/ 'to decay' (So), maari 'rest, stop' <- /maarit-/ 'to rest' (SA). The root-final /ng/ after a vowel
may be underlyingly /kJ or /ng/. If it is underlyingly /ng/, again the noun is regarded as derived from
the verb. e.g. iiro 'anger' <- /iirong-/ 'to get angry' (S J. See § 13.4.2.3 for the criterion of deciding
the underlying form of a root-final consonant.

"9.4.1 The Coordinating Conjunction jii 'and, or, also, either'
   The conjunction jii 'and, or, also, either' conjoins two or more words, phrases, or
clauses, at the same syntactic level. The speaker either lists     or contrasts the
entities/events referred to by the elements conjoined by jii. In the former case, jii is
optional.4conjoining words:9-45         ... hoo         ruu   peekang     .iii    korikang   nang-ki-ng.

  The suffix -nno is used to conjoin two nouns within a noun phrase. Note that the
syntactic function of this suffix differs from that of the comitative case suffix -nno
which conjoins two NPs. cf. §3.2.2.3 and 9-53 above.
  In the following example, two nouns nuka and umoka, coordinated by the suffix
-nno, constitute the head of the ergative noun phrase tii-ngi nuka-nno umoka-nno.9-54       ... tii-ngi            nuka-nno         umoka-nno       no-m-u-'-na: ""... ""

           ' ... my mother and father said to me: "".. .''' (VI-10)
  In the following example, the noun phrase poowoi-nno by itself constitutes the head
of an absolutive noun phrase, which functions as a term of address:9-55       oi      po-owoi-nno.
           hey     my-brother-in-law-and
           'Hey, brother-in-law (and someone else).' (V-17)
                                         ~tVr\s.
In this case, the suffix -nno indicates/\as if the speaker addresses not only the listener
referred to by po-owoi, but another person who is not overtly referred to. This is a
device to express politeness towards the addressee with the implication of duality. cf.
§4.2.2.

9.4.3.1 impa 'and then, now'
   The local noun impa 'this time, now' (cf. §4.4.2.5) functions as NP head. Like any
local nouns/pronouns, it can function as an adverbial modifier of a verb by itself:9-56          hoo      nee          muumiaku           impa         patak-u-i=to-ng.

              'The lord(= my dearest son) must be arriving now.' (1-10)
    The conjunction impa, on the other hand, is used to connect a clause with a preced-
ing independent clause (as in 9-58 and 9-59) or medial clause (as in 9-57). It is always
placed at the beginning of a second clause, introducing the description of an event
which the speaker wants to focus on. It is often used to introduce a new topic in the
discourse (as in 9-58b and 9-59).9-57          umi-ro                       impa               ruu         ong      angumuuka

    The conjunction mannilma'ni5 'then, so, certainly' is also used to connect a clause
with a preceding independent clause (as in 9-60b) or medial clause (as in 9-60a). It
indicates that the speaker is going to describe an event, which logically or naturally5   The form ma'ni is attested only a few times in the texts by two female speakers.

(9-61). It may be placed at the beginning of a clause {9-60a), or after the first or
second word of the clause, especially after the sentential topic (9-60b and 9-61).9-60a       tiwo=tiih-ku                                                    haa-u-u-na

    It is often used in combination with the conjunction tiko. See 9-62d in §9.4.3.3.9.4.3.3 tiko 'and, then, so'
   The conjunction tiko 'and, then, so' probably derives from the local article tii in the
purposive case.
   Tiko introduces an independent clause, and connects it to the preceding clause which
is also usually independent. 6 It indicates the temporal or logical sequence of a chain of
events. Observe the following sequence of sentences at the beginning of a narrative:9-62a       kupuna-no-ru                     hoo         Siuai-no-po                         ong      tui

6             -a~c;.~
  I \:-.~ve a fewl\examples where the preceding clause is a medial clause. Such a medial clause,
however, may be regarded as a separate sentence on a phonological ground (cf. §2.8 and§ 17.1). e.g.:
            haaro'-ro             manni.         tiko         jeewo-ning       koto   ngo-woro-hee?

Note that in 9-62d, where the narrator describes an activity which is the consequence of
the situation described in 9-62a- c, she uses the conjunction manni in addition to tiko.9.4.3.4      hoo(=hoo) 'so, now, then'
  The conjunction hoo(=hoo) 'so, now, then' obviouly derives from the masculine
form of the article hoo, which vaguely summarises the background situation expressed
in the previous clause (9-63) or understood from the context (9-64 and 9-65). The
second hoo, which is optional, derives from the same article functioning as a topic
marker. (The second hoo, if present, is invariably stressed. cf. §6.2.6.) Hoo( =hoo)
thus introduces a sentence or a clause, often with a new topic, with a certain illocution-
ary force:9-63         roo           tii          manni        toku      kumar-i-heeta-na.        hoo=hoo

             'You will certainly not laugh. Then (if you laugh) the Giant will smell us,

          her.' (V-40)9.4.3.5    tiko(=hoko) 'because'
  The conjunction tiko 'because' seems to derive from the local article tii in purposive
case, and the optional hoko from the masculine article hoo with the emphatic suffix -ko;)
The conjunction tiko( =hoko) is always placed at the beginning of an independent
clause, which denotes the cause of the event described by the previous independent
clause.9-66      impa-ko        hoo    toku      mu-kui-na.          tiko=hoko        hoo     Sande

  The conjunction roruki 'but, however' expresses that the sentence contrasts with the
previous sentence, or with something which is understood from the context. It may be
placed at the beginning of a clause (9-68b), or after the word which focuses on such
contrast (e.g. after the negator toku and the discourse marker nah-ah 'possibly' in
9-69b).

9.5        INTERJECTIONS  Interjections are the words which either can constitute single utterences by them-
selves, or are syntactically isolated from other elements in a sentence. They can be
subcategorised as follows:
( 1) emotive interjections
(2) interjections for attracting attention
(3) interjections for response
(4) filler words
  The endings of emotive interjections, and some interjections for response, are
characterised by a level high pitch (cf. §2.8).
  Note that in some interjections, such as ehe;ehee 'laughter', u'uung 'yes', hu'uung
'no' and he'ee 'no', a glottal stop occurs between vowels, which is not permissible in
general phonotactic rules (cf. §2.4.1).","[236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243, 244, 245]"
"
  Note that a demonstrative and an article classifier constructions, which contain the
same classifer, are juxtaposed to indicate the distributional plurality of the objects
referred to by the classifier. cf. § 10.3.3.4.8.1.3.1.2 muuko- 'other' and jee- 'what'
  Muuko-'other' (§4.4.2.4) is directly combined with classifiers. Examples found in
my corpus are given below:8-29       haha'       muuka-mah           ratik-u-u-na.

  In 8-29, muuka-mah functions as a post-head attribute, while in 8-30 muuka-wa' is
employed in a headless noun phrase functioning as a predicate in a nominal clause.",[201]
