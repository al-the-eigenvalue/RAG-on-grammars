9.2 CONSTITUENT ORDERThe predicate is typically the final constituent of the clause (see below for a definition                                              205

NPs precede the verb; if there are two, the subject must precede the object. There is thus
a fairly strict constituent order for basic Lavukaleve clauses: SOV (or, using DixonÕs
(1979) syntactic primitives, which are introduced below, SV/AOV).","[231, 232]"
"LavukaleveÕs relative clauses are internal relative clauses. Keenan (1985: 163) notes
that internal relative clauses are ill-attested in the languages of the world, but that all the
languages in which they are known to occur have a basic constituent order of SOV.
Lavukaleve certainly fits this generalisation.",[424]
"It was stated above that there was a fairly strict constituent order SV/AOV. This is for
the most part true; if both subject and object NPs occur before the predicate, they must
occur in that order, and usually the predicate is the final element of the sentence.
However it is not unknown for one of the NPs, usually the subject NP, to appear after
the predicate. If this does happen, there is almost always an intonation break between                                                      206

which the speaker, having omitted to mention the NP subject overtly, then wonders
whether the hearer understood it properly, and adds it in as an afterthought.","[232, 233]"
"Secondly, the chapter provides a brief overview of clause structure, constituent order,
predicate types and core participant marking, in order to enable the reader to parse
sentences in the rest of the description without necessarily having read every word of
the grammar. As these parts of the chapter are intended as an overview, structures are
discussed briefly, with cross-references to detailed discussions of each construction type
elsewhere in the thesis.",[231]
"
3.2 VERBSVerbs have the following syntactic and morphological features:· they function as argument-taking predicates
· they can take subject prefixes, and object prefixes if transitive
· they can take the Agreement Suffix to agree with their nominal arguments
· they can take TAM suffixes
· they can take the Nominaliser suffix -e ~ -i (they have to be nominalised in order to
  function as head of an NP)
· they can take the Locativiser suffix -lThere are three subtypes of verbs, defined on the basis of their primary valency.
Intransitive verbs take only one argument (subject). Transitive verbs take two
arguments (subject and object). Ambitransitive verbs can take either one or two
arguments, with no overt valency-changing morpheme to mark the change of
transitivity (though the appearance of object affixation makes the transitivity clear).
There are no ditransitive verbs in Lavukaleve (see Chapter 9.3.2 for argumentation for
this claim), and there are no verbs with zero valency. All verb stems are vowel-final.",[69]
"In English, sentence focus is marked formally by a prosodic accent on the subject NP.
This marking type, they say, comes about through paradigmatic opposition to predicate
focus marking in English, in which the prosodic accent is on the object: Òthe position of
the accent on the subject noun in the [sentence focus] construction is the result purely of a
formal requirement: the need to indicate a paradigmatic contrastÓ (p. 195). They present a
typology of formal marking of sentence focus, as opposed to predicate focus: sentence
focus marking in a given language may involve prosodic inversion, that is, giving the
sentence focus subject the prosodic accent usually associated with an object (or predicate);
changes to linear order; making the subject a single constituent within the predicate
(syntactic inversion); making the subject a non-topic; giving it non-nominative case
marking; or giving the verb impersonal agreement. Lavukaleve does not fit with any of
these formal marking strategies, but even though the material it uses to mark sentence
focus versus predicate focus is not covered in Lambrecht and PolinskyÕs typology, the
system it uses to mark the opposition between sentence focus and predicate focus is
exactly parallel to those used in many other languages.",[308]
"Sentence-Final focus constructions in Lavukaleve in which the focus marker agrees with
the object NP (or complement of a non-verbal clause) involve predicate focus. The focus
domain extends from the focus marker at the end of the sentence to the object NP which
appears before the verb; for the purposes of focus marking this domain of verb plus
object is called a predicate here, following Lambrecht. (Recall that Lavukaleve has fixed
constituent order of S(O)V.) Predicate focus is the most usual, frequent, and
pragmatically unmarked type of grammatically marked focus.",[283]
"In predicate focus, agreement extends from the focus marker at the end of the sentence to
the object argument, which occurs before the verb. Basic constituent order in Lavukaleve
is S(O)V. In sentence focus, agreement extends throughout the entire sentence from the
focus marker at the end through to the first element of the sentence, the subject. Ellipsed
NPs do not matter for the scope of focus; the focus construction utilises obligatory verbal
and focus marker morphology to express scope, and it does not in fact matter whether or
not the actual NP arguments are there for the scope to obtain. It is not clear to what extent
adjuncts are included in Sentence-Final focus constructions.",[290]

contradiction to the constituent-order generalisation made in Section 9.2 that constituent
order is SV/AOV. However, a better analysis is possible.","[297, 298]"
"Constituent order in Lavukaleve is fixed: SV/AOV. Departures from this norm are rare;
an argument which is an afterthought can be postposed. Preposing and postposing for
emphasis do not occur in Lavukaleve; these pragmatic functions are carried out instead
by focus constructions.",[39]
"The system of participant marking in these clause types is described in the first sections;
firstly for verbs, then for the Habitual Auxiliary. This is a rather complicated area of the
language, and takes quite some explanation. The actual clause types, Anterior, Potential
and Surprise, are discussed only after this preliminary material has been dealt with. It is
necessary to explain the participant marking first in order for the reader to be able to
understand the examples of these adverbial clauses, which is the main descriptive task
of this section.",[408]
"Ten thousand is expressed by a phrase: lamukasaol vo-na kanongam literally
Ôthousands of-them tenÕ. A hundred thousand is formed on a similar pattern, but with
the order of words reversed: tangalual vo-na lamukasaol kanongam literally
Ôhundreds of-them thousands tenÕ.",[78]
"There is a further reason for saying that me with the Agreement Suffix is a separate
word from the verb, to do with participant marking. In these constructions, regardless of
the transitivity of the verb, the suffix on me agrees with the subject (S/A). If the verb is
transitive, it takes an object prefix. It is ungrammatical for an intransitive verb to take
the subject prefix and me to be unmarked; or for the transitive verb to take subject
marking and me to take object marking. If the verb and me were morphologically one
word, one would expect, judging from all other participant marking rules in the
language, that participant marking would be flexible in this respect; one would expect
subject or object to be marked at either end of the word, as it can be in any verb. The
fact that there is no flexibility here suggests that this is not one morphological word.
Rather, the rule is that the verb, if transitive, must mark its object. This is in fact a fixed
rule throughout the language; see Section 9.7 for discussion. For these reasons, me is
regarded as a separate word, both on the phonological and morphological levels, in
these (as indeed in all other) constructions.",[382]
"
4.1 THE STRUCTURE OF NPSAn NP consists of a head, and, if this is a noun, it may be followed by optional
modifiers including adjectives. The Specifier adjective mea and the adjective ro ÔoneÕ
follow other adjectives and the final slot of the NP is filled, optionally, by the definite
article or a demonstrative modifier. If the head is a demonstrative or personal pronoun,
the only modification it can have is a demonstrative modifier. This word order is
obligatory. The only modifiers which can precede a nominal head are possessors, but
these occur in their own NP preceding the NP of the head noun.",[95]
"·   A few words have stress on their third syllable:                fela'koe           ÔvillageÕ

                mita'keu           ÔdogÕ· Recently borrowed words always receive stress in the place it would occur in the
  source language (even if extra syllables have been added in order to make the word
  conform with Lavukaleve phonotactics):                'kavis         ÔcabbageÕ (from Pijin 'kavis)

2.7.2 S TRESS IN MORPHOLOGICALLY COMPLEX WORDSAll lexical roots have stress. Generally, affixes do not have their own stress. In certain
circumstances, however, the Possessive prefixes cause stress shifts on the words in
which they occur.","[54, 55]"
"This suffix is one of the few morphemes in Lavukaleve which is subject to a phonological
rule. Its form undergoes vowel harmony with the height of the previous vowel of the verb
to which it is suffixed:verb ends in     form of Nominaliser suffix
-a, -o, -e       -e
-u, i            -iNote that the rule of reduction of identical vowels at morpheme boundaries, which is a
general feature of the language (discussed in Section 2.9.3), comes into operation with
nominalised verbs which end in -e and -i. This rule means that in practice one cannot hear
the suffix when it is attached to a verb stem ending in /e/ or /i/. However, there is no zero
nominalisation in Lavukaleve, and all verbs ending in /a/, /u/ and /o/ must use this suffix in
order to become nouns; so it is no difficult matter to say that on verb stems ending in /e/
and /i/ the Nominaliser suffix is obligatorily used, then lost due to morphophonemic
processes. Some of the verbs in the table below illustrate this.",[344]
"With nouns that undergo the loss of a final vowel under Possessive prefixing (see
below, Section 2.9), when this loss of the final vowel creates a monosyllabic noun, then
this stress shift rule applies to some words but not others:                'fina                      ÔbelongingsÕ
                'e-fin                     Ôour belongingsÕbut:                'langi                     ÔnameÕ
                o-'lang                    Ôhis nameÕIf there were a fixed rule to cover these situations, it would be possible to say that the
two rules, loss of final vowel for prefixed nouns, and stress shift for prefixed
monosyllabic nouns, must be ordered with respect to each other. However the fact that
both patterns appear shows that the rules do not have a fixed ordering with respect to
each other. Rather, it seems each word has its own pattern.",[56]
"4
  The term ÔPresentativeÕ is perhaps a bit unfortunate, as it is also used for, e.g. Ôpresentative
constructionsÕ, which is a rather different phenomenon. However, I continue to use the term, following
Fillmore, in order to avoid perhaps more confusion.

  Aka means, in various contexts, ÔsoÕ, ÔthenÕ, ÔandÕ, ÔthusÕ, ÔnextÕ and so on. However for the sake of

18.2.2 OVERT NPS AS AFTERTHOUGHT ADDITIONSThe pattern above, of referents introduced by overt NPs and then tracked primarily by
verbal prefixing, is the typical way of structuring reference tracking throughout a
narrative. Overt NPs are also used as last-minute additions, when the speaker suspects the
audience might not understand which referent was intended. Such afterthoughts usually
occur after a pause. The last NP of the following excerpt, otum na, is an example of an
afterthought NP (the pause is shown by slashes):15)    Oia               vau      mo'sil               savun           fale    mea             o

       She goes out to the sea shore, she is standing up, and he [the husband] comes ashore.   co 340In fact, overt NPs in texts are not very common, and it is particularly rare for a transitive
verb to have overt NPs for both its subject and its object. There is a strict word order rule
in Lavukaleve that if two NPs, subject and object, both occur in a clause, the subject NP
must precede the object NP. A transitive verb with two overt NPs does occur often in
elicitation, but in texts it is very rare indeed. This is probably because the discourse role
of NPs is mainly, as has been seen, to introduce or reintroduce participants. Speakers do
not usually introduce two participants in one clause. Therefore a subject and object NP do
not usually co-occur in one clause.","[458, 459]"
"
15.4 DEFINING FEATURES OF COORDINATE -DEPENDENT CLAUSESStructurally, clause chaining constructions consist of one or more coordinate-dependent
clauses, each one with its own coordinate-dependent predicate, followed by an
independent (main) predicate. This order of clauses is obligatory; the coordinate-
dependent clauses always precede the independent clause (though see below for an
environment when a coordinate-dependent clause can follow its main clause). The
independent predicate has all the structural possibilities of any independent predicate in
the language. Coordinate-dependent predicates however have a number of special
properties particular to them.",[394]

14.1.7 L AVUKALEVE ÕS SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS IN TYPOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVECompared to many grammatical topics, there is a vast literature on the typology of serial
verb constructions. DurieÕs (1997) account of serialising languages divides languages
into four types, under two parameters. The parameters are whether the verbs of the verb
sequence are contiguous, and whether they are incorporating: that is, whether the
components form a single morphological word. This account clarifies the relationship
between serial verb constructions and verb compounds. In Lavukaleve, serial verb
constructions are non-contiguous (see above, where it was shown that NPs and adjuncts
can intervene between verbs of a serial verb construction) and non-incorporating (the
verbs do not form a single phonological or morphological word). LavukaleveÕs verb
compounds (to be discussed below, Section 14.2) are, however, both contiguous and
incorporating; the verbs involved do form a single morphological and phonological
word.",[372]
"
13.3.3 IMPERSONAL CONSTRUCTIONSImpersonal constructions involve transitive verbs which have no object cross-referencing.
They are in fact the only construction type in the language in which a transitive verb fails
to receive object indexing; and it is by this feature that they can be distinguished from all
other construction types. Impersonal constructions are a unique morphological pattern
which is sufficient to demonstrate constructionhood. In particular, there are verbs which
are otherwise solely transitive (i.e. not ambitransitive) which in this one function appear
with a single argument. The patient, which one would expect to be the object, is
expressed as a subject, and the agent, which one would expect to be the subject, is not
expressed. The construction is used to avoid mentioning an agent of a verb. The agents of
verbs in such constructions are almost always magical beings. There is no cultural or
linguistic restriction on talking about magical beings, but often people prefer not to spell
such things out in so many words. The Impersonal construction provides a mechanism
for talking about such things without having to be explicit.",[357]
"The following discussion covers the form and functions of LavukaleveÕs
demonstratives. In particular, their discourse functions are described, mainly drawing on
terminology from HimmelmannÕs (1996) typology of demonstrative uses. There are,
according to this schema, four typical discourse functions of demonstratives: discourse
deixis (reference to an event or proposition or segment of discourse, rather than to an
entity); tracking (making reference to usually major participants in order to keep track
of what is happening to whom); recognitional (the referent can be identified by specific,
shared knowledge); and situational (making reference to an entity present in the speech
situation). Only some of LavukaleveÕs demonstratives can be used for each of these
uses.",[184]
"It was said above that coordinate-dependent clauses precede the main clause, but there
are occasional examples where one of the coordinate-dependent clause in a chain
actually follows the main clause. The instances in which this happen are clearly
examples of afterthoughts; the coordinate-dependent clause is added after the rest of the
chain as a just-remembered addition, or in order to clarify a part of the event. In each of
the following examples, note the pauses (marked by slashes) after the main clause,2

the scope of this thesis.",[401]

Lavukaleve. The first principle is that all transitive verbs must be cross-referenced for
their objects. The second principle is that all sentence-final focus constructions like this
one require an argument to be cross-referenced by the Agreement Suffix on the verbal
element before the focus marker (see Chapter 11). Normally these principles do not
collide, because normally in single-word predicates either subject or object can be
marked at either end of the verb, by either prefix or suffix. So it is possible always to
choose to mark the one required by the focus construction by the Agreement Suffix, and
to mark the other one by a prefix. However, in verbal complexes, marking of subject
and object occurs in a fixed position. The object must be marked on the verb, and
subject must be marked on the Habitual Auxiliary. Now, because the focus construction
requires the object to be cross-referenced by the Agreement Suffix, a morphological
dilemma arises. The language must either violate its rule of marking object on the verb
and subject on the auxiliary, or violate its rule of only marking each argument once per
predicate. The latter alternative is apparently preferable. In only this circumstance can it
mark the same argument more than once within the one predicate (although note that
there is somewhat of a similar situation in certain types of relative clauses: see Section
16.3).","[378, 379]"

2. KAL : the noun suffixes -kal to form a plural
3. UL : the noun suffixes -ul to form a plural
4. VIL: the noun suffixes -vil to form a plural
5. V: the noun suffixes -v to form a plural
6. L: the noun suffixes -l to form a plural
7. MAL: the noun suffixes -mal to form a plural
8. N: the noun suffixes -n to form a plural
9. VERAV: the noun suffixes -verav to form a plural
10. OTHER: including suppletion and other irregular formationsThe declensions are named for their most basic formative, but within most declensions
there are a number of largely phonologically determined subclasses, with slight
variations of this basic suffix. The variations mostly involve various vowels preceding
the basic form of the suffixes. There are also a number of irregularly formed members
in most of the declensions.","[127, 128]"
"The third part of the thesis concerns predicate structure. Basic clause structure and
principles of participant marking are outlined in Chapter 9. Constructions using the
Agreement Suffix are examined in Chapter 10. The Agreement Suffix, one of the
morphological means of marking participants, is a ubiquitous and important suffix in the
language. Focus constructions, discussed in Chapter 11, are another very elaborated area
of Lavukaleve morphosyntax. There are three paradigms of focus markers in Lavukaleve.
Many different types of constituents can be focussed: a predicate, a sentence, an NP or an
adjunct, including nominal adjuncts, adverbs, particles and non-main verbs. When
predicates and sentences are focussed, the focus marker is the final element of the
sentence. The agreement of the focus marker (with the person, gender and number of
either the subject or the object of the clause) shows the domain of focus. When arguments
and adjuncts are focussed, the focus marker appears immediately after the argument,                                              ix
sentence-internally.","[9, 10]"
"In Lavukaleve, all verbs of a serial verb construction must share their subject arguments
as well as all adjuncts and all morphological categories, and transitive verbs must share
their object arguments. They cannot independently choose their arguments. For this
reason, LavukaleveÕs serial verb constructions can be classified as nuclear layer
serialisation. Note that there is a tendency pointed out by Crowley (1987: 42) that SOV
languages (of which Lavukaleve is one) Òtend to prefer nuclear juncture between verbs
when they have serial constructions, and for SVO languages to prefer core junctureÓ.
Lavukaleve, then, accords with this general tendency.",[373]

than the more general foia. It is used only for tracking (making reference to usually
major participants in order to keep track of them throughout a narrative). But within this
general tracking function, oia has a specific domain of usage. It is used to refer to an
entity who is not the most activated one at the moment of speech. In practice, this
means that someone who was in the conversation some short time ago will be referred
to using oia, to mean Ôthe one who I talked about beforeÕ. In narratives, oia is used most
commonly to reactivate a non-activated participant.","[194, 195]"

4.1.2 MODIFICATION IN NPSAdjectives, the demonstrative modifier and the definite article may be used to modify a
head noun. Demonstrative and personal pronouns may be modified by the
demonstrative modifier only. The maximal NP structure given above makes some broad
claims which should be commented on. Firstly, the schema indicates that any number of
adjectives may occur in an NP. Actually, in texts no more than three have been found
per NP, and elicitation speakers were unwilling to allow more than two or three
adjectives within an NP, preferring instead to use a series of shorter sentences, or to use
intransitive verbs rather than adjectives. Secondly, while other adjectives can occur in
any order with respect to each other, if ro ÔoneÕ occurs with other adjectives, it must be
the final one. The next sections describe in turn the elements which can be used for
modification of a head noun inside an NP.",[97]
"In this description, ChafeÕs (1987; 1994, especially pp. 53-56 and Chapter 6) notion of
activation is used2. He distinguishes between three levels of activation. That is, out of
all the many concepts people have in their minds at any one time,
         [a]n active concept is one that is currently lit up, a concept in a personÕs focus of
         consciousness. A semi-active concept is one that is in a personÕs peripheral
         consciousness, a concept of which a person has a background awareness, but which is
         not being directly focused on. An inactive concept is one that is currently in a personÕs
         long-term memory, neither focally nor peripherally active. (1987: 25)Activation is a matter of degree. An entity, once active, gradually loses its active status
over time. Lavukaleve neatly encapsulates the degree of activatedness of a pronoun
1
  The terms ÔProximalÕ and ÔMedialÕ are not so immediately relevant for the oia demonstrative, but are
retained because of morphological parallels with the foia and hoia demonstratives.
2
  This term ÔactivationÕ is borrowed from discourse analysis and psycholinguistics, in order to describe
the semantic-pragmatic functions of the oia pronoun, especially with respect to how it differs from foia.
But in using the term, I do not necessarily subscribe to all the theoretical concerns of the area from which
the term is taken. I only use the concept with respect to reference tracking; the wider implications of
activation in the language are not dealt with here.",[195]
"
6.2 AGREEMENTGender is expressed in Lavukaleve primarily through agreement, not through the form
of the noun itself, despite the importance of phonological form of the noun for gender
assignment. Almost all nominal modifiers agree with their head nouns; that is, the
definite article, adjectives, demonstrative modifiers and the focus markers. Also
demonstrative pronouns show gender agreement. Further, some elements agree with
                                                    130
                                      6 - GENDER AND AGREEMENTnouns across the clause. Verbal prefixes which cross-reference objects (but not those
which cross-reference subjects) show gender agreement, as does the verbal Agreement
Suffix. Actually, all these elements show not just gender but also number agreement.
For most forms, gender and number are expressed together in portmanteau morphemes.
An example of this concordance shown in different word classes throughout the
sentence:5)     airaol      le'laol        ruiaol          feol      leiaol.

       ...two old women live there.                                                co 033Throughout the language, however, all gender distinctions are shown only in the
singular and dual numbers; plural forms never express gender. This is true not just of
morphological affixes and grammatical words, but also of many lexical items (e.g.
vo'vou Ôboy childÕ, vo'voul Ôtwo boysÕ; vo'vo Ôgirl childÕ, vo'vol Ôtwo girls; tulav
Ôchildren (either/both sexes)Õ). That is, there is a syncretism of the three genders in the
plural number. This collapse of gender distinctions in the plural number is the kind of
syncretism which Corbett (1991: 190 ff.) calls convergence, and is a relatively common
phenomenon in the languages of the world. The only thing perhaps slightly less
common is the fact that gender distinctions are maintained throughout the dual number,
and converge only in the plural.","[156, 157]"

OBJECTSAs there are no ditransitive verbs in Lavukaleve, it is no difficult matter to establish

function which is not an A or an S is an O; any grammatical relation which is not a
subject is an object. The morphological and syntactic criteria adduced above for the
justification of the subject relation work also, in converse, for the justification of an
object relation.","[235, 236]"
"However, even though the Lavukal population has grown, Lavukaleve itself is seriously
threatened, but the threat comes not from Bugotu but from Pijin and English. Solomon
Island Pijin, the lingua franca for the whole country, has a strong influence in the
Russells. All radio broadcasts are in Pijin or English. The language of the church (both
Anglican and Catholic) is mostly English, although there are some Anglican church
services in Lavukaleve (Church of England in New Zealand 1951, c.1973, and Church
of England in Melanesia 1975), and translation of more liturgies is in progress. School
is conducted in English and Pijin. Apart from the Church of Melanesia orders of
service, there are currently no reading materials available to Lavukal people, written in
Lavukaleve. The languages of the outside world are Pijin and English. Even though
Lavukaleve is the first language for most Lavukals, most people, especially younger
people, are also fluent in Pijin. In the West Russells, people live a very traditional

learning Lavukaleve as their first language. In the East Russells however, an area much
closer to Yandina both geographically and socially, Pijin is slowly taking over, and
many families do not speak Lavukaleve to their children. As a result, many of the
families I talked to in the East Russells have children who cannot speak Lavukaleve.","[35, 36]"

14.1 SERIAL VERB CONSTRUCTIONS
14.1.1 INTRODUCTIONSerial verb constructions consist of two or, rarely, three verbs in juxtaposition,
functioning as a single predicate, with no morphology to mark their relationship with
each other. Each of the verbs receives its own stress, and thus is a separate phonological
word, but the construction as a whole is expressed in one intonational unit. Verbs of a
serial verb construction share their subjects and (if more than one member is transitive)
objects. They also share adjuncts. They share all their morphology except object
marking; all transitive verbs cross-reference their own objects. However, all other
categories that can be marked on verbs (e.g. subject marking, TAM, polarity, valency
changing, and other morphology) are marked only once on the predicate, and have                                             339

mark the gender and number of one participant. This gender/number marking is used to
mark the subject of stative/resultative intransitive verbs (as opposed to active
intransitive verbs which use a verbal subject prefix to cross-reference their subject), and

CHAPTER ELEVEN
Focus constructions
11.1 INTRODUCTIONThere are three focus markers in Lavukaleve, functioning in a grammaticalised focus
system, which is a very prominent part of the language. Syntactically the focus markers
are independent words which occur in construction with the constituent immediately to
their left. This is often an NP, but can also be an adjunct, a dependent clause, a predicate
and its object or an entire sentence.","[272, 273]"
"
9.3.2 GRAMMATICAL RELATIONSThe syntactic functions of A, S and O are unproblematic in Lavukaleve; however for the
purposes of describing Lavukaleve morpho-syntax, rather than using A, S and O, it is
simpler and descriptively more revealing to use the grammatical relations of subject and
object. These grammatical relations are defined in terms of A, S and O. Subject is, again
using AndrewsÕ definition, Òthe grammatical relation, if there is one, that is associated
with A and S function; object the grammatical relation, if there is one, that is associated
with O functionÓ (1985: 103).",[234]
"On the surface, verb compounds differ from serial verb constructions only in their
participant marking system, but this difference points to very different fundamental
structures. Verb compounds consist of two lexical verbs, but, whereas in serial verb
constructions the subject is marked only once, on the final member of the serial verb
construction, and the object is cross-referenced separately on each transitive verb, verb
compounds display the participant marking which would be expected on a simple
predicate. That is, subject and object are marked once only across the predicate, and
subjects can be cross-referenced either by a prefix (thus on the first verb of the
predicate) or by a suffix (thus on the second verb). They cannot be marked by a suffix
on the first verb or a prefix on the second verb. The verb roots must be contiguous.",[373]
"The semantics of LavukaleveÕs system of participant marking of intransitive predicates
are similar to the semantics of active/agentive participant marking systems described by
Mithun (1991). In Guaran’, Lakhota, Central Pomo, Caddo and Mohawk the subjects of
intransitive verbs are marked either in the same way as transitive subjects or in the same
                                                     244

as an active/agentive alignment system. However even though semantically the use of
the prefix versus the Agreement Suffix in LavukaleveÕs independent non-focus
intransitive predicates is similar to the active/agentive participant marking systems
described by Mithun, formally the system in Lavukaleve is not an alignment system; it
is not the case that there are two kinds of intransitive subjects, one marked like objects,
one marked like transitive subjects, as in MithunÕs languages. Rather, there are two
participant marking systems available: one uses the same system as used by transitive
verbs; one uses the system used in focus marking, in marking the heads of relative
clauses, and in marking adjectives to agree with their head nouns. The choice between
the systems in intransitive predicates is based on a semantic distinction between
stative/resultative and active clauses.","[270, 271]"
"Focus is a central part of Lavukaleve morpho-syntax. It is heavily grammaticalised into
clause structure, and extremely frequent in discourse. Roughly one third of all clauses
have some kind of grammatical focus construction. Any constituent can be focussed,
including NPs, postpositional phrases and other nominal adjuncts, adverbs, predicates
(either just a verb, or a verb with its object), subordinate clauses, the lexical part of a
complex predicate, or indeed whole sentences. There are two different kinds of
syntactic focus construction, one with the verb in a special form, used to mark focus on
predicates (verb plus object) or whole sentences, and one without this special verb form,
used for focussing on arguments, adjuncts and non-main verbal forms. In both
construction types, focus is marked by special particles, which occur immediately after
the focussed constituent and show agreement in person, gender and number. The scope

                                       1 - I NTRODUCTIONof the focus is indicated by the agreement of the focus marker. There are three separate
paradigms of focus markers, which differ in terms of the sentence type with which they
occur. One is used only in polar questions; one in content questions and environments
expressing particular kinds of emphasis; the third is used elsewhere.","[39, 40]"
"If the subordinate verb is intransitive, the logical subject of the verb is cross-referenced
with a prefix from the object prefix paradigm, not with a prefix from the subject prefix
paradigm. In addition, a prefix e- (glossed SuBorDinate) intervenes between this object
prefix and the verb stem, in what is normally the subject prefix position. The paradigms
for subject and object prefixes were given in Section 9.7. Note that 1st person dual and
plural, 2nd person and 3rd person feminine dual and plural prefixes are identical for
subject and object, so it is only the other forms that show that intransitive subjects are
marked as objects in subordinate adverbial clauses.",[409]
"As has been evident from some of the above examples, subjects and objects differ in the
ways in which they are cross-referenced in serial verb constructions. A subject
argument can only be cross-referenced once per predicate (although it does not have to
be cross-referenced at all), on the last verb of the predicate, whereas an object argument
must be cross-referenced on every transitive verb of the predicate. This is because of the
principle of cross-referencing in Lavukaleve that every transitive verb must cross-
reference its object argument (see Section 9.7). However, even though each transitive
member of a serial verb construction must have its own object cross-reference, the
cross-referencing material all refers to the same argument. It is not the case that each
transitive verb of a serial verb construction chooses its own object argument, but rather
there is a morphological constraint that each transitive verb must be indexed for an
object argument. See below (Section 14.2 on verb compounds) where there is,
unproductively, a lifting of this constraint.",[368]
"The members of the verbal complex share their arguments, and participant marking is
shared between them, in a very particular way. The Habitual Auxiliary can only ever
cross-reference the subject (S/A), never the object argument (with one exception,
                                                   349
                                          14 - COMPLEX P REDICATESoutlined below). The verb can only cross-reference the object, if it is transitive, never
the subject. The Habitual Auxiliary can use either a special subject prefix, or else the
Agreement Suffix, to cross-reference the subject. Unlike with verbs, the subject cross-
reference on the Habitual Auxiliary is obligatory.","[375, 376]"

11.3.2 SENTENCE-FINAL FOCUS CONSTRUCTIONSIn Sentence-Final focus constructions, the focus marker appears as the last element of a
sentence; this sentence may be verbal or non-verbal.","[281, 282]"

11.6.1 NO MARKED FOCUSNot all Lavukaleve sentences have marked focus; in fact only about a third do. Under
LambrechtÕs analysis, all sentences convey information; they all have information
structure, and thus they all have focus. This is certainly true for Lavukaleve, as for all
languages. The above analysis has suggested that are two types of sentences in
Lavukaleve: those with grammatical focus constructions, and those without. By this,
however, it should not be understood that those sentences which do not employ a focus
construction do not have focus. Rather, in those sentences which do not employ focus
constructions, speakers are still conveying information about something; they are still
dividing their speech into presupposition and assertion; but they are not making this
distinction grammatically overt in the way a focus construction does. In other languages
with grammatically marked focus systems, for example Somali (Saeed 1984), the focus
system is likewise not used in every single sentence of the language.","[305, 306]"
" In Lavukaleve, then, it is possible to pile up focussed element after focussed element. In
languages with grammatical focus marking, it is common for only one instance of this to
be allowed per sentence. Lambrecht (1994: 237-8) notes that English does not allow more
than one grammatically focus-marked (i.e. clefted) element in a sentence. There is a basic
principle which many languages follow, which limits the amount of focussed information
which can appear in one sentence. Giv—n (1975) argues, from comparison of focus
constructions in Bemba, Rwanda and Zulu, that Òthere exists a strategy of information
processing in language such that the amount of new information per a certain unit of
                                                          278

his emphasis). Pawley and Syder (1977; 1983) make a similar point with their Òone-
clause-at-a-timeÓ hypothesis. Du Bois (1987: 826), on this topic, formulates a ÒOne New
Argument constraintÓ, which says that speakers prefer to introduce a maximum of one
new argument per clause. He explains this in terms of a processing limitation: ÒNew
(previously inactive) information appears to be more difficult to process, and hence most
subject to constraintÓ (Du Bois 1987: 846).","[304, 305]"
