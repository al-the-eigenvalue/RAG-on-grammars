"The verb go2 is derived from k l 'to accompany' and the verbalizer z . ~
' This order is a little odd for an A-P-V (SOV) language. One expects to find
the copula immediately following the verbal noun. This order is also inconsistent
with the rest of verbalization in the language. which is found after the verbalized
pan of speech.
- An alternative word for 'green, blue' is hifa. However, it does not seem to be
in widespread usage.
  Wagner (ca. 1935: 47) gives 'have' as kl 'to be with.' See Chapter 4, Section

         This chapter describes how noun phrases, verb phrases (including the
verbals structures), and particles are put together to form longer utterances.
People do many things with language. We make statements concerning the
world around us (declarative sentences). We ask questions, and sometimes
command someone to do or not to do something. Each of these kinds of
utterances has one (or more) specific constructions. Statement, question, and
command forms can then be used for a variety of other functions. For example,
questions can be used to make requests or invitations. Statements can also show
empathy, expectation, or obligation. These functions are shown through the
mode particles and auxiliaries following verbs and are found in Chapter 5. The
first three sections of this chapter describes the construction (syntax) of utterance
types.
         In addition to types of utterances, an utterance may be simple or complex.
A simple sentence has one clause. A clause has one main verb which shows
agreement and may show tense, aspect and mode. Chapters 3 and 4 developed
the verb phrase with pronominal agreement. The inflected verb phrase is the
simplest complete clause in Euchee. A complex sentence has more than one
clause. The second clause may be embedded within the main clause, or the two
clauses may be joined one after the other with a coordinating conjunction.
         Sentences that are manipulated to focus the most important information in
the sentence are given in the section 7.
       This section describes the basic word order for Euchee. Although the
noun phrase is free to move into many places, the word order in daily usage is
fairly constant. Changes in word order generally create a change in focus and or
for topicalization.'
       The basic word order in a one-place declarative sentence is Actor (A) or
Patient (P), then Verb (V). In a two-place verb, the order is Actor (A) then
Patient (P), then Verb (V). These orders are illustrated below.
       Since the participants are marked on the verb, they can be left out of
sentences.(1)    a. 'Ahdgwa.
          'a-hd-gwa
          LOC-~PL(E).ACT-say
          They say'       b. Wethyaeyu.
             we-thyreyu
             3sG(~~).ACT-be.stingy
             They restricted it (water).' (JC)       c. Dzoshifa k'a se 'yushi.
          dzoshi-fa                k'a           se-'yushi
          sofki-CL/DET(STAND)      thing         ~sG(EF)-s~~
          'She's stirring up the sofki.'       d. Sedo'rene jt
          se-do-'me                               je
          ~SG(EF).PAT-~SG  . ACT/PLUS-ask         PAST
          'I asked her (already).'         1
        Because the information on the participants is marked on the verbs, it also
allows the noun phrases to move. Speakers can still undenand who is doing
what to whom because that pronominal prefixes make it clear, even if the Agent
and/or Patient is not in their usual places. In the sentence below 'Sissy loves
Sonny,' the pronominal agreement on the verb is sio-. This informs the hearer
that the actor is female, so 'Sissy' must be the actor (the person doing the loving,
not receiving the love). The possible word orders are shown in (2a-c). The basic
word order (APV)is given first. The examples in (2d-f) have an asterix (*)
because they are impossible word orders.","[466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472]"
"       Even though noun phrases have the freedom to move when their
information is marked on the verb, Euchee is an APV word order language. This
order has far-reaching consequences on the rest of the language. One of the
consequences is that all the modifiers follow the phrase they modify (their head).
This is true of the noun phrase, where numbers and adjectives follow the noun,
as seeen in (4a-b). It is also true of the verb phrase, where mode and tense
follow the verb, as seen in (4c).(4)    a. shaya n6wE

          'two squirrels'       b, Nvnv hap'a'aete.

           'I guess I can go.'",[473]
"Discontuous constituents are rare, but the word order is possible.",[475]
"       A third participant is present when the embedded effect verb requires a
patient. The word order is Causer [Aflected Patient V(Effect)] V(Cause). This
basic word order is shown in (73a). However, the embedded clause can act like
an independent clause in regards to word order. So, when the participants' roles
in the embedded clause are clear, as they are in (73b) with 'Amanda' and 'bread,'
the orders inside the embedded clause can be reversed.(73)   a. Staci Amanda k'athl'o sethla: sethla.
          Staci [Amanda k'athl'o se-thlae]           se-thla
          Staci [Amanda bread         3s~(E).~Cr-eat]3s~(~~).~cT'-make
          'Staci made Amanda eat the bread.'       b. Staci Amanda k'athl'o sethla: sethla.
          Staci [k'athl'o Amanda se-thlre]       se-thla
          Staci [bread      Amanda 3sc(~).~cr-eat]3 s ~ ( ~ ~ ) . ~ c r - m a k e
          'Staci made Amanda eat the bread.'",[510]
"However. the (76b) tends to focus the handing to Mose instead of someone else.
or 'She handed the baby to Mose (not Boston or Danny)'. See Chapter 8. Section
7 for focus and topic strategies.
       When a speaker wishes or needs to make all three participants into noun
phrases, the most common word orders are Actor-Patient-Recipientmeneficiary
and Actor-Recipient/Beneficiary-Patient. See Chapter 8, Section I , for possible
variations in word order. (In 77a) below, the actor is clear because of the gender
on the actor pronominai prefix. In (77b), both the actor and recipient are female,
so the recipient noun phrase is made clear by the classifier. This is important
when the word order changes.(77)    a. Georgina gone Mose siowa
           Geornina gone-seci           Mose       &-w8
           Georgina baby -CL(EF-SIT) Mose          ~sG(EF).ACT/PLUS-~~V~
           'She gave the baby to Mose.'        b. Josephine send Maxine chyaso siokwane.
            Josephine sen6     Maxine chyaso          sio-kwane
            Josephine CL(EF) Maxine money             ~SG(EF).ACT/PLU~-~~~~
            Josephine lent Maxine money.'","[205, 206]"
"
       At first reference, or when the particpants are not otherwise known to the
hearer, the speaker may state the participants in noun phrases instead just the
pronominal agreement on the verb. This is often necessary when both the actor
and the affected participant are 3d person. When both participants are given in
noun phrases, the word order is Causer [Affected V(Effect)] V(Cause). The
brackets [ ] indicate the embedded clause. The surface order is the basic Actor
Patient order, but importantly the affected participant is in the embedded clause
with the effect verb. This is shown in (744, again with brackets [ ] around the
embedded clause. The first noun phrase is always the actor, as seen in (72b).(72)   a. Staci Amanda se'a sethla.
          Staci      [Amanda se-'a]      se-thla
          Staci      [Amanda ~SG(E).ACT-C~~]
                                         ~sG(EF).ACT-~~~~
          'Staci, Amanda cry, she made.'
          = 'Staci made Amanda cry.'
       b. Amanda Staci se'a sethla.
          'Amanda made Staci cry.'
          *'Staci made Amanda cry.'","[509, 510]"

I""' a,1cl2""""Person Actors: P-A-V Order
          The basic order of the pronominal prefixes on the verb is Patient-Actor-
Verb Stem. or P-A-V. This means that the patient pronominal prefix is the first
prefix. and the actor pronominal prefix is inside, closer to the verb stem.
          The 3rd person pronominals are structurally in a different place from the
1"" and lnd
         person prefixes. They are located before the patient and actor
sequence. S e e Section 5.3 below for discussion about the location of the 3""
person. However, this structural difference does not always affect the linear
order of the prefixes. So, when a 3rd person is the patient. and the actor is a I""
or 2"" person, the placement of the 3d person outside of the rest is not
noticeable. The order of the pronominals is still P-A-V. This is seen in (29)
k!o~:!.    The s!r~c!nm! erder ~f !he prefixes nn !he verh <!ern are <pen in !he hnw
in example (29). The linear order of the pronominals on the verb stem is given
with three examples underneath the structural order. The pronominals are in line
with the appropriate pronominal slot on the stem. These three examples are
shown again in (29a'-c') with the interlinear translations. Although the 3rdperson
example in (29c) is clearly in the outermost slot, this can not be seen in the word
order of (29c').","[164, 165]"
"       When the patient is an inanimate object. the 3rd person inanimate patient
                               spronominal prefix hi- generally does not appear on the verb. The exception is
the required /ti- verbs explained in Section 4.3 below. Instead, the object can be
named. as in (30n), or referred to with a demonstrative pronoun. as in (30b)
below. The patient may be left out all together after first reference or when the
item is understood by the nearer, as in (30cj.

3"" Person Actors: A-P-V Order
       As mentioned above, the 3d penon prefixes are outside of the I"" and 2nd
prefixes, yet when the 3rdperson is a patient, the prefix order on the verb is not
affected. However, whenever there is a 3""1person actor, the linear prefix order
shows is affected. Instead of the Patient-Actor order, the 3d actor comes before
the Is' and 2"" patient prefixes, creating an Actor-Patient prefix order. The
difference in the linear order of the prefixes can be seen by comparing (35a) and
(35b) below. The example in (35a) shows a 3d person patient; it is the same as
(35c) above. The example in (3%) shows the 3d person actor: Since there is
only one place for the 31d person on the Euchee verb, there can never be two 3rd
person pronominal prefixes on any verb. When both the actor and the patient
are 3rdperson, it is always the actor prefix which is on the verb. as is shown in
(35~).

"Gender-and Animacy       Nicklas (1994a) gives an historical explanation for the 3rd person
pronominal prefixes being on the outer layer of the pronominal complex. He
states that they are 'relatively new based on their position.' There is reason to
believe that this can not explain the placement of the 3rd person. Irregular verb
forms are generally considered to be relics of older fonns in a language, and as
such they are often used in the recreation of historical forms. The irregular
pronominals in Euchee are given in Section 8 below, and the irregular stems in
Chapter 4, Section I .4. The irregular pronominal prefixes and the related
irregular stems give an indication of the 3d person prefix placement through
time. The irregularity in both sets is due to the pronominal prefixes having fused
with the stem. This irregularity is only found in the 1"" and 2"" singular forms. If
the 3rd person had been with the Is' and zndperson actor and patient agreement.
it is reasonable to assume that they would have contracted and eventually fused,
too. The fact that they did not indicates that the 3rd person has been outside of
the other agreement for a long time, or at least as long as the irregular verbs.
       Another explanation for the placement of the 3"" person pronomirnal
prefixes can be due to animacy requirements in the language. As shown above.
Euchee has a stative-active system of pronominal agreement. This differs from a
nominative-accusative system, where the roles (subject and object) are marked
by their structural postion. However, in a stative-active system, the roles are
determined by the inherent aspect of the verb. What is crucial here is that the
all active verbs--by far the majority of verbal expression in the language--require
an actor, and the prototypical actor must be able to initiate or control an action.
In other words, the actor must be animate. Animacy seems to be a motivating
feature in Euchee. For example, the actor pronominal prefix is closest to the
verb stem,"" and it is the role that is required on the verb when both the actor
and the patient are 3rdperson. In addition, the inanimate 3rdperson is not able to
initiate action and is thus barred from participating as an actor.
       I"" and 2"" persons are clearly animate, immediate, and able to be actors.
The 3'd persons are not necessarily animate, are removed from the discourse, and
therefore are not clearly actors."" However, the 3rd person can be made animate
through noun class (gender). Gender is a mechanism for making sure that the 3rd
person is, in fact, a person or at least animate with ~ ' e'animate.
                                                            -        non-Euchee.'
The placement of the 3rdperson furthest from the verb stem appears to be a
unique result of the animacy hierarchy.')4.4 Dlscussro~ON VALENCEAND TRANSITIVITY       Some two place verbs require the do- actor [+participant]even though
they show no change in valence today. The verbs in (70a) do not have an
alternate one-place activity reading which would require the di- actor set. It
should be noted that the list excludes any jlir stem verbs, whose contraction with
the 1"" singular pronominal prefix is also do-. The set in (70b) includes the do-
verbs. which can be activity verbs. That is, they can occur without a patient (for
example. in response to the question, 'What are you doing?'). Even so, they
always occur with the do- actor [+panicipant]pronominal prefixes. not the
expec~eddi- actor set.

       dikhat'e               'I lean against to block'       Wagner (1934:328-330) noted that some verbs could have pronominal
agreement from either the di- actor sel or the do- actor set, He described the
difference between the di- two-place (transitive)verbs and the do- (transitive)
verbs in terms of specificity: The di- set by-and-large requires a general object
and the do- set by-and-large requires a specific object.
       Ballard (Ballard 1978) 169-184 states that the di- actor set is generally
transitive ierbs and the do- actor set is generally transitive verbs and verbs
whose object is someone else's possession (p. 173). In his analysis, di- is derived
from Id/ fused with hi-,an inanimate, unpossessed object. Likewise. do- is
created from Id-/ and ho-, a benefative or possessed object (p. 182). (The
underlying /d/ differs from /dz/ in focus, where the /dl verbs focus on the object
and /dz/ verbs focus on the subject.) However, this analysis relies on the
morphemes /ti- and /lo- being between the actor prefixes and the verb stem. This
is contrary to the analysis in Section 4.3 above. where hi- and ho- are inanimate
and are in the same position as the other 3rdpersons, that is, outside of both the
actor and patient positions. Importantly, however, Ballard's analysis shifted the
discussion towards the benefactive, which was taken up by Nicklas (1994a; ca.
1995).
         Nicklas (ca. 1995) posited a morpheme b- (admittedly a tentative form)
between the stem and the pronominal complex. This was a very promising lead
in the extrication of the [+participant]prefix. However, he analyzed this
rnorphe~neas a prefix marking the beneficiary only, not a general valence
increasing prefix. Nicklas, too. placed the inanimate 3d person prefix hi- inside
the pronominal complex and not with the other 3d persons. In his analysis, the
beneficiary prefix b- contracted with the inanimate prefix hi-, creating ho-. This
form ho- is ultimately contracted with the other pronominal prefixes.
         All of the previous researchers on Euchee pronouns used the structural
positions of subject and object in their analysis. Thus. they were concerned with
structurally different types of verb: intransitive. transitive and ditransitive verbs.
Each of these verb types reflects a difference in valence, and many transitive
verbs can have intransitive readings (and vice-versa), but overall this structural
view of the language misses the fluid nature of valency in Euchee. Stuck in a
more rigid view of transitivity, the difference between the verbs (70) and (7 1 )
had escaped clear definitions.
         A stative-active system does not focus on the structural positions of
subject and object (transitive verbs). Instead, the inherent aspect defines the
type of verb (states and events) and therefore the roles of actors and patients.
Events can be activity. process, motion verbs. which only need one participant.
Or they can be events proper, whose actions are delimited by the patient.
Although these categories exist in a subject/object language, the change in
category is often accompanied by a change in verb. The [+participant]valence
prefix changes activities into event, and two-place events into three-place events.
         In terms of valence then, the di- verbs in (71) are event verbs which are
always two-place. They have not changed from one-place verbs. and they can
not easily change into three-place verbs. The do- verbs in (70) represent
                                                                                         .
lexicalized forms. They may have changed From one-place verbs. The one-
place (activity or motion) usage has fallen away or shifted to another verb stem.
An example of the lexicalization of do- could be dofa 'I cut (something) off/l
stop a flow.' Both translations are two-place in English. However, the 'stop a
flow*could easily have been a one-place (di-) action, but the specialization of the
action requires an object 'the flow' in translation to English. The more general
use 'to cut off something' refers to not only to water, but also someone's lane
while driving, cutting off the electricity to a house or appliance, cutting off
support for someone, and so on. This generalization could have begun 'I cut off
the flow of the electricitvlhis monevthis path,' which would have required the
valence prefix and the contraction of di- to do-. The same argument can be
made for Wagner's pair dijlatsz 'I set afire' and do',,arsZ 'I bum [(something)]'(p.
328), and so on.","[197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202]"

animacy. If the named object does not have the ability to i~liriareaction (does
not have self-\~oliriotz),it is classified as inanimate. Tables, trees, meat, and
computers are all examples of inanimate objects in Euchee. There are three
distinct inanimate classes based on the inherent position of the referent: sitting,
standing, or lying position. Nouns which refer to something which is has self-
volition (such as humans, animals. and some natural phenomena) are classified
as animate. Animate nouns are divided into two classes: those who are Euchee.
and everything else (called 'non-Euchee'). The Euchee class is divided by male
and female.
           In a true noun class system, a noun does not change its class once it has
been assigned. This is the case with the classes given in Figure 6.1. The
markers for the animate Euchee male class and animate Euchee female class
have variations. These variations are socially deictic: They change in discourse
depending on the social/familial status of the speaker in relation to the
social/family status of the referent, and they include ideas of formality and
informality. I analyze these variations as formal and informal speech styles. not
as classes. I use the term 'honorifics' for the formal speech variations. The
honorifics. and their variations by men's and women's speech, are described

calling the honorifics and men's and womem's speech variations additional
classes (Wagner 1934; Wolff 1948; Linn 1997). The animate noun class system
and the social variations have undergone clear and remarkable changes in the
last 120 years. Noun class systems are often dynamic systems where the
interaction between the language system and of a culture are seen. Shifts and
obsolescence of noun class systems is a common symptom of language decline,
but also of semantic shift, and family or dialect variation in usage. The
mechanics of most of these changes are rarely documented, but in Euchee they
can be gleaned from earlier records. These changes are noted below.
       Noun classes are commonly fused with other grammatical functions. and
in the case of Euchee, they show both noun class membership and definiteness.
The class morphemes are cliticized to the end of noun phrase in order to make
the phrase definite. Thus, they are generally translated as 'the*or 'that.' Besides
being used as the definite determiner, the noun class morpheme is obligatory in
all operations of definiteness in the language: possessive phrases, demonstrative
adjectives and pronouns, and the interrogative pronoun 'which.' Another
characteristic of noun class systems is that they are often in agreement with
other constituents of the sentence. In Euchee, the noun class post-clitics must
agree with the pronominal prefix on the verb.","[385, 386]"
"       Some verbs require three participants. In three-place verbs, the patient is
not marked on the verb so it must be stated as a noun phrase, unless the hearer
already knows what the patient is. However, if they are, the order is Actor (A),
Patient (P), and the third participant Recipient (R) or Beneficiery (B), and then
the verb (V). Generally, all three participants are not stated. Again, this is
because the verb carries the information. Generally, the actor is known and not
state. The recipient/benefaciery is focused and placed before the patient. The
typical order is illustrated below.

"
       When the possessor is an independent noun, the word order is POSSESSOR
POSSESSED. Thus, the noun modifier is before the head noun. The possessee
must also have possessive pronominal prefix. The prefix agrees with the
possessor, and is chosen from the pronominal class the noun falls in.(111) a. boshi y6mp'ae

               ADJECTIVESAND PRONOUNS       Euchee demonstratives show two degrees of distance in demonsrratives.
These two distances are represented by three morphemes. Ne and 'a correspond
to the English 'this' and 'that' respectively. The third morpheme, -le, can be
interpreted as either 'this' or 'that'. Speakers of the Bigpond Dialect do not use
'a; instead, -le has the sole meaning Lhat'. Aii iinguisis who i~avt:wuriizd ors die
language record only two distances. Therefore, it is not likely that be
represented a third intermediate distance, or that 'a was a further distance such
as 'that, way over there,' in recent history.
          Ne, 'a and -1e are must have the appropriate class post-clitic to refer to a
singular noun or the appropriate plural post-clitic to refer to plural nouns. As the
definite suffixes on the noun often carry the same weight as the demonstratives.
the use of a demonstrative has a clear pointing out, pointing to its location, or
contrastive feeling. These same bound stems are used in the formation of place
deixis 'here, there.'
          The demonstrative adjectives are placed before the noun they modify.
Euchee is basically a head-first language; that is, modification tends to be after
the noun. However, the demonstrative-noun word order appears to be an areal
feature of the Southeast, showing up in all the southeastern languages with the
exception of Choctaw and Chickasaw. The class or plural post-clitic on the
demonstrative adjectives must agree with the class assigned to the noun.( 1 13)   a. ned k'as'stichyacj            'this car'

              ' a h senetha ha             'those forks'          In the demonstrative adjective construction, the class and the plural post-
clitic may be dropped from the noun.

intensity. The setsx that participate in sound symbolism follow:(66)   a. s i                                                'small'

Lexical stress is indicated in three ways: primary stress (a), secondary stress (A).
and disyllabic words without stress are marked ( 8 ) for clarity. Sentence level
pitch parterns are marked, (a f ) for rising intonation, and (a L) for falling
intonation in this section, but are left unmarked in the other chapters. In
addition, the stressed syllable in information question pronouns are accompanied
the rising pitch, which is marked (i).","[104, 105, 106]"
"          The impersonal pronominal prefix go- is used to take focus away from the
actor. They de-emphasize who does something. The actor may be unknown. or
the speaker may not wish to cast blame or doubt on the actor. These are
impersonal sentences, and are best vanslated as the passive.( 1 14)   a. Go'yushe disha.

without changing the meaning of the word. These are 'ladder', 'broom', and 'nail'.(62)    a. stakeneb                   'the ladder, upright'
           stakenek                   'the ladder, on the ground'                                      'the broom, upright'

:herefcre a!! these cases are ~ssignedto h!h -fa a d -'e. A!! have !he ahi!i!y tc
stand upright although they are not restricted to this position. Speakers do not
have a preferred class for these items when they are given out of context, but
the choice of noun class post-clitic for these three words depends on their
position at the time of the reference. Noun classes should not change like this.
However, these three words are exceptions in Euchee. Other semantically
possible candidates for being able to change category are ungrammatical if
dually assigned. All of these words are relatively new in Euchee, so it is quite
possible that they .were assigned the two most likely noun class post-clitices by
speakers indifferent areas, and both have become acceptable now, favoring the
position they are found in.
       There is room in the assignment of inanimate class markers for verbal
play. An unexpected noun class post-chic may be used in order to accentuate or
point out a peculiar or odd shape. For example, 'nose' is assigned to the -chi
'sitting' class. However, in one instance speakers found it humorous to use -fa
'standing' when refemng to certain types of noses.","[391, 392]"
"       This fully developed system of dependent marking is not regularly used

determined by a rigid word order. Then, the embedded complement clause

       The Euchee language is an American Indian language isolate. It is the
language of the Euchee people, who originally lived in the North American
Southeast and now live in the state of Oklahoma. This is the first comprehensive
grammar of their language. It includes a description of the phonology, the
morphology. and the syntax. The data is presented so that it is immediately
accessible to linguists of any theoretical persuasion. The presentation should also
make the information accessible to lay readers, in particular to interested
members of the Euchee Tribe. It is written in the proposed Euchee orthography.
The data used for this grammar were gathered primarily through elicitation of
-grammatical fonns and texts with native speakers.
       Euchee has a large inventory of sounds. There are 38 consonants and I I
vowels. The consonants include a series of glottalized stops, fricatives, and
resonants. The vowels include nasal contrasts. The syllable structure is a fairly
rigid CV, but the phonology is distinguished by contraction of syllables. There
are two major dialects of Euchee today.
       Euchee is largely a polysynthetic language. However, the morphemes are
not as bound as formerly thought. Instead, many affixes are independent
panicles which cliticize to their host in unstressed contexts. Euchee recognizes
four main parts of speech. the noun, verb, adjective, and adverb. However. the
formal criteria for ihese are difficultto establish. Euchee has basic SOV word
order and is head-marking, and so the morphology is largely made up of suffixes
and post-clitics. The exception is pronominal agreement. which are all prefixes
on noun and verbs. Particles, including postpositions, follow the head.
       Euchee is a stative-active language. Verbs that are states (stative) are
distinguished from verb that are events (active). The pronominal agreement
reflects the semantic role of the core participants. State verb require a patient
pronominal as their sole participant. Event verbs require actor pronominal
prefixes as their sole participant, and an actor and patient pronominal for two-
place verbs. Adding participants or reducing the number of participants is shown
by valence prefixes on the verb. Since panicipant information is encoded on the
verb, the nouns may be freely dropped in discourse. Euchee also has a rich
mood system, where mood panicles are highly combinatorial for subtle nuances
in meaning.
       This dissertation includes two texts. One is an example of formal,
ceremonial speech. The other is a short sermon ending in a prayer. There is
also a small collection of proverbs.

4. MODEAUXILIARY VERBS: ABILITY, NECESSITY, AND PROBABIITY             Languages can mark mode. which has three main functions. Mode refers
to the speaker's attitudes towards the situation. Mode also show what we want
to do through language. Finally, mode can reflect the knowledge we have about
the situation. Euchee uses mode markers to express all of the functions.
             Three modes--ability, necessity and probability--are expressed with
auxiliary verbs. An auxiliary verb follows the main verb. It is unlike a main
verb in that it does not have pronominal agreement. When there is no auxiliary
verb, the main verb stem carries the aspect suffix, and then past tense and
perfective (global) aspect may follow the verb. This can be seen in the order
given in (a) in Figure 5.1. However, if a mode auxiliary is used. then the
auxiliary nllrsr carry the aspect for the verb, as seen in (b) in Figure 5.1. The
tenselperfectivity panicles follow the mode auxiliaries.","[312, 313]"
"       When used in complete sentences and clauses, the postpositions generally
occur with one of the general location/direction suffixes and are independent
particles. However, when a postposition phrase is given by itself, they can be
independent word, and therefore stressed. Or, they can be unstressed and
cliticize to the noun. However, the end of the noun gets primary stress, so the
difference is a matter of emphasis by the speaker. Some phrases tend to always
be cliticized, as are the examples in (126).                                    'over his head'
                                    'on his feet'
                                    'under his feet'
       Adjectives and quantifiers, such as 'many' or 'few' are verbal structures.
The follow the noun that they modify. However, they are always clauses.
Adjectives and quantifiers are found in Chapter 7: Verbal Structures.
       Adjective and quantifiers are dependent clauses. As such they must have
a dependent clause marker. These are the noun class and plural post-clitics.

       A few adjectives can appear non-verbal after a noun. These are
restricted to common adjectives such as h 'big' and s'i 'small' and a few others.
When these occur, the noun class or plural follows the adjective. These
structures are most likely on their way to being compounds. A few examples
follow. The second in each pair is the verbal adjective with the active verbalizer
-5 or the stative verbalizer -1e.(127) a. 'yd fi                         'a shining star'
              'yd   frm                 'a shining starme star is shining.'       b. 'ya 'a?                       'a big tree'

          shus'i                        'a minnow'       Euchee can have recursive adjectival modification, although speakers
prefer to have no more than two adjectives in a phrase. If the string contains a
color term, the color term will always be the closest to the noun; numerals are
always last. The noun class/deteminer post-clitic attaches to the end of the noun
phrase.(128) a. hostane 'yakiicj                                 'the white box'
         hostane 'yak2 hohb'Ecj                           'the empty white box'
         hostane 'yak8 'aele hohf 'Ecj                    'the big empty white box'          b. k'asothl'ine titiha                          'yellow pencils'
             k'asothl'ine titi hinegiiha                  'new yellow pencils'
             k'asothl'ine titi hinegiiha nbwii            'two new yellow pencils'As can be seen above, the noun class/determiner post-clitic or the plural post-
clitic follows the noun and its adjectivets). Although it follows the last modifier.
the numarals are outside of the noun phrase. 14 They may have once been verbal
structures.
' The word for blujay ts'e is probably onomatopoeic.
   The meaning 'human' is for the most part 'Euchee,' although the meaning has
expanded in recent times. Gatschet recorded it as explicitly Euchee, but
speakers today insist on gor'e being all humans, not just Euchees. The possessive
pronominal we- versus go- on body parts definitely divides Euchee body parts
from non-Euchee human body parts, and the pronorninals we- versus go- in
deverbal nouns also distinguish Euchee from non-Euchee human activities.
There is no word *wet2 meaning non-Euchee human, implying that hurnaness
was restricted to Euchees. This is not an uncommon separation in languages.
On the other hand, the human marker is used to describe non-Euchees for the
names of races and some other Tribes:(i)    gotsyathla     human-red             'Native Americans'
       go'ispi        human-black           'African, African-Americans'
       go'yaka        human-white           'Caucasians'
       WP'~                                 'Creek'  This is the expected order in an APV (SOV)language. However, the head in
the left position runs contrary (Williams and DiSciullo 1987), who argued that
compound heads are universally the right stem. On a descriptive level, this is
not upheld with quick perusal of grammars of most Native (SOV)languages.
However. Williams and DiSciullo argue on theoretical grounds that the heads of
all words are the right-most element, including derivational suffixes. Thus, the
nominalizer (derivation) could be the head in Euchee. The nominalizer -ne is the
same as the habitual aspect -ne on verbs (inflection). Noun and verb stems, as
argued in the text, have little distinction. If they are indeed simply [+stem]
underlyingly, and not specified for noun or verb, then the -ne is for all stems.
The habitual suffix gives the verb a non-event reading, and non-events can be
used in the syntax a s norninals. Although the habitual is integrated more fully
into the noun stem (it gets the primary stress for the noun) than on the noun (it is
unstressed), it is still an inflectional affix. Thus, the heads in Euchee can still be
argued to be the left stem, contrary to the universal right-head hypothesis.

   The word 'sword' jGfhl'igZ is no longer attested by speakers, They agree that
this is a probable word for 'sword', but they have never heard the word used
before. However, assuming that they would use this word for 'sword', they agree
with the analysis differing 'sword' from 'a long knife'.
  Wagner (1934: 317-18)also considered all two syllable stems to be compounds.
He presented the bisyllabic compounds in three categories, combining the degree
of interpretability of the head and modifying stem:(ii)    Wagner's Bisyllabic Compound Categories
        Noun+Adjective                   both independent words
        Noun+SpecifyingElement           independent + bound and obscure
        Theme Element+SpecifyingElement both bound and obscureWagner's first two fall under my first group, and his last falls into my third group.
The problem with Wagner's presentation is his wording and the amount of data
that he gave to support these categories. The term 'theme element' is
misleading; it sounds as if the first syllable were a classificatory morpheme.
However, the first syllables are not classificatory morphemes, they are the heads
of the compounds. Then, Wagner gave only a few examples of each of his
categories and made no comments on the productivity of the stems as compound
heads. He did not show the relationship of the arguably older bisyllabic
compounds to noun modification and compounding in the language
   Rankin uses only heads we, go, and da as an ancient classificatory system. He
compares these with phonetically and semantically similar classification
morphemes in Proto-Siouan. The resemblance between these morphemes are
striking and deserve continued attention, but the grammatical basis for their
comparision-a classification system-is tenable.
'  The word for 'face' is commonly given with the noun class post-clitic -ci today.
This is clearly the noun class post-clitic, however, and not a modifier as the
pssessive forms shoe: didaci 'my face' and 'odaha 'our faces.'
   There is a good possiblity that the stem of these nouns comes from the
adjective ts6ldzci (today d f i or hidz9) meaning 'greenblue.'
9
  It is easy to confuse words which are formed with the we- as part of the stem
and those which are we- given with the animate non-Euchee possessive prefix.
 Each must be tested by eliciting other possessive forms of the word. By this
 method I have eliminate some words commonly found in comparative literature
 as including we- as pan of the stem. A few of these are given examples below
 so that the status of we- as the possessive prefix can be seen. The classifier or
 plural is given in parentheses:(iii)   sh'i          'bone'
        wesh'i'ha     'Its/His bones (non-Euchee) I/ animal bones'
        gosh'i'ha     'someone's bones//human bones'
        dish'iha      'my bones'
        gosha         'louse, lice'
        wesna         'his (nun-Eucheej iicz; He ilas iice.'
       di dzyogosha          'my lice'lo   'Big House' is a figurative usage for the clean ground or ceremonial ground.
I ' Crawford consistently records the nasal variation -nZ in his field notes with
Mrs. Nancy Wildcat. However, the -ne and -nZ occur in free variation with
speakers today, with a propensity towards the non-nasal variation. This is
expected as there is denasalization at the end of words and phrases (see Chapter
2). Nasalization of this morpheme was not recorded before Crawford.
'? This reconstruction was given by Mr. William Cahwee.
l 3 The word for 'cow' is most probably derived from wedi 'buffalo' and the -ne
diminutive. Today, speakers are not able to assign meaning to wedi by itself.
However, Gatschet recorded it alone meaning 'buffalo' (1885) The modem term
for buffalo, then, has been lexicalized from wedi and ga 'old man'.
14
     This is expected if all independent noun phrases are adjuncts, as proposed by
both Jelinek (1983) and Baker (1996) for polysynthetic languages.
l 5 For some speakers who are not as fluent socially, the inanimate classes have
merged into one definite morpheme, similar to the English 'the.' The default
class -ci 'sitting' is the definite morpheme.
l6 There is also some question of several families in Georgia who claim Euchee
heritage as well. One speaker, who told of meeting one of these extended
families, did not use the Euchee class with them. I do not know if this is
because they were outwardly more clearly of African descent than of Euchee
descent and thus did not seem Euchee to this speaker, or because there were no
clear family ties.
    In his 'Some Grammatic Elements of the Yuchi Language,' Gatschet (1905) re-
worded 'not related' to read 'not of the same totem.' Although some Euchee
elders refer to clans, many others do not remember a clan system growing up.
Instead, they refer to a person's lineage association through their kir, [he tribal
town or stomp ground.
''  Gon ';iskPweno is also the word for 'picture' and 'photo'. With this meaning, it
always takes the inanimate noun class post-clitic -ci.
 19
     Gatschet and Wagner recorded the word for' Creek*as gopa. Gatschet's
consultant, Mr. David Bamett, gives the translation as 'people burner*from when
the Euchees were at war with the Creeks. This is a plausible etymoloy, with go-
p l being 'human-bum.' However, I (as did Crawford) get a clearly glottalized
gop'a for 'Creek'. Mr. Henry Washburn stated that his mother thought it was
because [he Creeks stare at people. In this case, the etymology would be go-p'a
'human-look at.'
'O The Euchee have been friends with the Shawnee since before removal. See
Jackson (1998) for details of this ongoing relationship. This variation of the word
'Shawnee' translates as 'little Shawnee'. It does not refer to the current split in
the Absentee Shawnee Tribe between North and South Little Axe Ceremonial
Ground. Speakers do not think that the two words refer to the different Shawnee
Tribes in Oklahoma, the Absentee, the Loyal and the Eastern Bands. Thus, it
may have referred to pre-removal relationships.
*'   One of my female consultants reports that the possessive do- series is used
mainly in men's speech for family terms. However, Wagner gives the opposite.
 He gives the do- set is used mainly in women's speech. The speaker today is
 from Polecat area, and Wagner worked mainly with speakers from Sand Creek
and Big Pond areas. The speakers today from Big Pond Dialect do not use the
do- for men's speech. So, the difference could be one of dialect variation.
""   It was impossible to elicit a clearly definite 'the Tuesday' without the meaning
'on*because phrases such as 'the Tuesday before last' or 'the Tuesday when
Richard was here' still contain the meaning 'on the Tuesday.'
23 Both Gatschet and Speck recorded the demonstrative pronouns as the only
independent pronouns.
""   This is contrary to what I have proposed earlier. b Linn (1996) I asserted that
the classifiers (and plural) morphemes must be the left-most constituent in a
definite noun phrase.

       Verbs have been treated extensively throughout this work. This chapter
looks at other parts of speech which can be made into verbs. The process is
quite productive in Euchee. Most parts of speech can be interpreted as a verb
simply by adding a verbalizer (active and stative aspect), tense, or mode particle.
This underscores the notion that stems are not marked for category but are
interpreted as a noun or a verb in the syntax. If a stem is followed by verbal
inflection, then it is a verb.
       This chapter covers verbal nouns (predicate nominals), verbal adjectives
(predicate adjectives), quantifiers, and location and position constructions.","[429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436]"

Two-Syllable Srems and Slrorrening
       There are very few two-syllable stems that are not anaiyzable as
compounds. Those that exist are probably compounds whose parts are no longer
recongnizeable. This is due to two forces in the language. One is the loss of
meaning over time of some basic stems used in compounds. For example many
two-syllable nouns end in /ba/ or Ida/, but there is no known independent
assigned to ha/ or Ida/ today. In addition, the head of the compound (the Ieft
stem) may also become inscrutable over time. In this way, both pans may not
be analyzable.
       The most common loss of meaning is due to compunds which have been
shortened over time and whose full forms are no longer remembered or able to
be reconstructed. The words in their shortened form were learned by children at
some point in the past, and the full forms are no longer remembered. There are
two mechanism for shoneninfg words in Euchee. One is simply deleting a part
of the word. The head of two-syllable compounds, especially common heads
                          .   . -
such as k'a 'thing' and Iva 'tree/wood,' and go 'human' are often deleted withoutany loss in meaning to native speakers. The pronominal agreement from
nominalized verbs is commonly dropped, as is the nominalizer -ne. In addition to
deletion is the phonological process of contraction where a syllable is deleted
and this affects the vowel of the preceeding syllable. One of the effects of
contraction is vowel lengthening, but even this indicator has generally been
dropped from Iexicalized contracted forms. See Chapter 2, Section 4.1 for
contraction.
       An example of an apparent two-syllable stem is teshrr 'rope.' For most
speakers, the parts are not separable or understandable today. However, the late
Mr. William Cahwee pointed out that it is indeed shori for p'arejbshlme 'rope' or
ore accurately 'they handle horses.' The word undergoes all of the changes
discussed above.(12)   a. p'ateyashune                full form

           'rope'       The result is a two-syllable word, which without the aid of an insightful or
highly informed speaker. can not be firmly reconstructed. The words listed in
( 13a) below are examples of two-syllable nouns that resist analysis but aredeemed to be formed by compounding. In (13b). the -ne may be the nominalizer
suffix (see Section 2.3 below). or the -ne may be the archaic diminutive suffix
(see Section 2.1 below), but the heads are not recognizable today.

       Compounding is highIy productive in Euchee. Outside of the very rare
borrowings, compounding is the only source for new words entering the lexicon.
A compound is a word created out of two stems, like 'blackbird' and 'babysit' in
English. There is always a 'head' of the compound. The head is the stem which
determines the part of speech. So, in the English examples, the head is on the
right. as 'blackbird' is a noun and 'baby&'     is a verb. However, in Euchee the
head is the left stem. This can be seen in the examples below. In 14aj. the
noun 'insect' is made from the head ~ h 'headcsmall
                                        o           round thin$ and modified
with the verbal adjective stem spa'be elongated.' In 14b). the head is 'hands' and
the modifier is the verb 'you wash in' with the nominlaizer -ne.

          'bathroom sink'This order is expected for Euchee because throughout the language, all modifiers
follow the head. For example, adjective clauses follow the noun phrase: location
phrases (postpostions) follow the noun phrase; and the tense and mode follow the
verb phrase.3
       The are only a few exceptions to the head noun being the left stem. Most
notably is the adjective chya 'hard, difficult, fast.' It may be used as the head. as
seen in (15a). However, these may be cases where the head noun has been
deleted. In (15b) the head of 'money' used to be a noun ti 'yellow' which
referred to 'gold.' It is probable that (15c) also contained the head se 'metal' at
one time,( 15) Adjectivemerb + Stem       a. chyatsa                    'crawdadJcrawfish'

       c. (se?)chyaka                'canJtin can'       There are three patterns of compounds in Euchee. The stems may both
be basic stems. This is the simple compound. The second patterns is that the
head may be a basic stem, and the modifying stem may be another compound or
a nominlaized verb. The third pattern is that the head may be a compound, and
the modying stem may be a compound or a nominalzed verb. These words are
generally long. The head may not be a nominalized verb. These pattems are
discussed below.
       Section provides examples of a basic stem used as the head for the many
compounds. In this way, the vocabulary is expanded. Below is one basic stem
being used in the creation many new words, but as the modifying stem. The
basic noun is shy 'juice, liquid( 16) Basic Stem as modifier in compounds       shi                                                  'juice, liquid'

of the internal construction of nouns, and it gives them much pleasure to see how
their ancestors named things. It also gives a mechanism for creating new words.
a mechanism which they are often highly conscious of. More recently coined
words. such as 'car'. 'television', and 'curtain,' exemplify the creativity and they
show regional and/or family variation. Here is an example of the variations for
'window.' The speakers' names and their families' original towns are given.","[357, 358, 359, 360, 361]"
"       Besides stress, the placement of the Yes/No question panicle /-'Is/ can be
used to determine suffixes on the verb from bound and independent panicles
following the verb. The Yes/No question particle must appear at the end of a
phrase. and it prefers to attach to the second phrase in a clause. See Chapter 8.
Section 3.1 for details of its placement. Since it attaches to the end of a
complete phrase. it is the most reliable test for the end of the verb phrase in
~uchee.' In the examples below. (2a) shows that the ability mode te .can' is

          'Did he ask you?' (women's speech)       The result is that the Euchee verb is not as synthetic as was previously
assumed. The verb stem has the pronominal and valence prefixes and only a
few aspect suffixes. All other aspect, tense, and mode are independent particles
following the verb.
       There are several problems in determining the linear order of tense,
global aspect and mode particles. First, they are at the end of utterances and
undergo phonological reductions. Some are dropped or are contracted with the
auxiliary stems; the vowels reduce to t'([A] or [a]) and voicing distinctions are
faint, causing distinctions between panicles to blur or be lost altogether without
more historical re-creation. Second, some of the panicles can be combined in
different orders to create subtle nuances in mood and aspect. Third. some mode
particles are resistant to placement tests (the Yes/ No question particle and the
past tense) due to their meanings. These are usually put with the other mode
particles until a more definitive placement is found. Finally, some of the
information is carried by mode in Euchee is elusive to speakers. They are best
understood in context, and so there needs to be more analysis of texts.","[291, 292]"

       Equative relationships are contain two nouns. The first noun names a
person or thing. This is followed by the verbal noun, which renames or clarifies
the first noun. Equative relationships do not use the copula iua. However, tense
and/or mode particles may follow the verbal noun.
       Giving family and other human relatianships are equative structures. The
first noun is the person's name, such as Josephine in (3a). The person's name is
generally followed by their noun class, such as sen6 in (3a). Then their
relationship to another person is given in the verbal noun, such as selaga 'her
grandmother' in (3a). The verbal noun always has a possessive prefix since
relationships are inalienable. Tense and mode may follow the verbal noun.(3)    a. Jospehine sen6 selaga.

          That's his father.' (men's speech)       Another type of equative relationship points out a person. In English, the
subject is the impersonal 'it.' In Euchee, no pronoun is necessary. The person's
name is given. The name is then followed mode, as can be seen in (4a-b). The
copula kla is not used by itself in these structures, but must be used in order to
use the past tense jZ. This is shown in 4c).(4)    a. Wan62?              'Who is that?'","[438, 439]"

common when stating something that the speaker knows to be true. The

       The following expressions are used as mode with the affimative 'yes'

uses the ability re for the meaning 'could.'

'  Wagner (1934) did not state how he determined suffixes from clitics. Tense
and modes are suffixes (pp. 351-352, and pp. 353-355, respectively).
'   The consequence is that tense and mode are treated as separate from the verb
   hrase in Euchee.
'It is probable that the future nasal is n contraction of the inchoative port-clitic
 2 with the stem. This is normal contraction in Euchee (see Chapter 2, Section
4.1 Contraction). The immediate future fits semantically with the inchoative. In
addition, the tense particles are grammaticalized from auxiliary verbs of position
(Linn in prep). Sitting ci became the past imperfective j5. Standing fa became
the present, as in 'akeFB That's the way it is.' It is also used in the past
perfective jzfa. The lying 'e would fit nicely into this pattern of
grammaticalization, with '2 having the progressive and immediate future reading.

    Crawford was treating ie as an aspect suffix 'duration' (rough notes). I reject
this on the grounds of stress. Primary stress falls on the last syllable of a stem.
So, for example, the habitual aspect suffix -ne gets primary stress on verbs, and
when it acts as the norninalizer for verbs, it still gets primary stress on the end of
the noun. If le were an aspect suffix like -ne, we would expect this same
behavior, but is the last syllable, it should have primary stress. But, as stated in
the text. it is not stressed.
         In addition, the habitual -ne can be used on a11 verbs and verbal
structures. but as a verbalizer le can not be attached to existing verbs. Since
adjectives always have a verbalizer, it raises the question as to whether the
adjective is underlying a verb, and that le is durative aspect and T is progressive
aspect on the verb, However, without le or '2, adejctives can not function as a
verb. No such morphology is needed for other verbs (including stative verbs). In
addition. le cannot be added to active verbs in order to get a reading of say. 'She
 lived for a iong rime.' or 'He smoked cigarettes d~tringhis liferime.' Therefore, le
 is considered to be a cliticized verbalizer and not an aspect suffix.
         The verbalizer -lc is possibly related to direction ciitic -kc, meaning
'movement along or down a long object'. Other location clitics are used as
aspect. For exampie, on nouns -1e (a homonym with -1e 'movement along or
down a long object') is the direction 'back to,' and on verbs it is the repeated
aspect. The distant location -ke indicates heard action verbs. The meaning of
*alongan object' could be interpreted as 'a long time, over a long period of time.'
 However, this interpretation seems more likely under the 'duration' affix
 hypothesis of le, This is because it is not clear why le would get a 'verbalize'
 reading on some nouns but a 'direction' reading others. This can be explained if
adjectives are underlying different from nouns or verbs.
          The cliticization of le does raise interesting speculation into the history
and nature of suffixes in Euchee.

    Speakers read this hypothetical lengthening form as the future ~swhi:      They
(nan-Euchee)will be pitiful.'
    It is not clear why the auxiliary requires the verbalizer before the completive
de (if it is indeed the completive). Since auxiliaries are not fully verbal, it could
be that Euchee requires an active verb in order to show completion. The
verbalizer 'Z carries the present continuous aspect. A parallel is found in the
adjectives fonned with the duration -1e. These require the copula n ~ abefore they
can be put into the past tense.
7
   The extreme combination of modes is probably due to two factors. First, the
Chief does vev tittle direct speaking. The Speaker for the Chief usually speaks
for the Chief. When the Chief does speak, it is the highest level of formality
and politeness. In addition, this form is archaic and represents the fullest forms
of Euchee.
h e analysis of herzu'e is not certain. It could be the completive de, as with the
'should/ought to' re'2de (also a tentative analysis). However, since the vowel is
always reduced, the final vowel is not definitively reconstructable. The vowels
 which commonly reduce to dl! make the possibilities de, /de/, Ida/, /dB/. and /d8/.
Another possibility is that the de is not the completive, but particle of strong
potential. This would parallel the structure her2 gd 'might have to' where gd is
the potential mode.
9
    The speaker has regularized the form. The 1"" and 2"" person singuhr forms of
(8o)nd 'come' are irregular. The 1"" person form is dz6 'I come.'
 10
    According to de Haan (De Haan to appear), scholars of epistemic modality
argue that evidentials are related to doubt and certainty of the the proposition,
 but that grammars of individual languages report that speakers do not show
differing degrees of certainty with evidentials.
 "" Another possibility is that h~5is a discourse marker at the end of the
 utterances. However, it does not occur frequently in any person's speech. as one
 would suppose of a discourse marker.

1. OVERVIEW
       This chapter introduces the noun and noun phrase. This includes the basic
stems and stem formation through compounding and the nominalizer -ne
(derivation). It also includes the affixes and clitics which create a noun phrase
(inflection), such as the noun class clitics, plural clitics, possession prefixes, and
location suffixes. Following this are other modifiers which are used to extend
the noun phrase.
       There can be up to three noun phrases as participants in a Euchee
sentence: the actor, the patient, and the recipient or beneficiary. However, the
participants do not have to appear as overt noun phrases. The pronominal
agreement prefixes on the verb indicate the participants in the event or state
denoted by the verb. Therefore, if the participants in the sentence are clear from
context. the noun phrases are omitted. Context includes previous mention in the
discourse and shared world knowledge by the people engaged in rhe
conversarion, In discourse. the nouns may be reinserted for focus, emphasis, and
clarification if needed.
       Formally, it is difficult to distinguish noun s from verbs in Euchee. No
one affix is able to distinguish the two. The traditional criteria for establishing
nouns as a pan of speech separate from verbs and adjectives are difficult to
apply. This is illustrated below with some of the ways in which nouns, verbs.
adjectives. and sentences share the same morphology.
       The ability for nouns to show definiteness is one of the standard criteria
for nouns. Although there is no detinite or indefiinite article, as in the English
'the' and 'atan,' Euchee does have definite particles which are cliticized to the
noun (see 3.1 below). Yet, the definite markers are not unique to the noun
phrase. Instead, they are identical to location verb (go)nb 'be located' and
position verbs ci 'sit,' fa 'stand' and e' 'lie. Examples (1)-(2) below compare
definite nouns with simple sentences. Definite nouns can be seen in the (a)
examples, while sentences containing a location or position verb that is identical
to the definite marker on the noun are found in the (b) examples.(1)    a. dathlawen6

"       Despite the consistency of height on morphemes, and their resistance to
other phonological rules, some instances of height in BPD leave open the
possibility that, a t least a t o n e time, the raising in BPD was not morpheme bound
but a product of a more general heightening rule or vowel harmony. For
example, some BPD speakers will pronounce kede 'now' a s [kedi], but the spatial
morpheme -de will not be [-di] in other occurrences. Additionally, in a few
cases. it word final vowel will be heightened, such a s (46) above. where the verb
I s k ' irne is pronounced Lgni] by BP speakers.""   A possibility still remains that
the BPD 2ndperson singular pronominal prefix ni- and the 3rd person non-Euchee
pronominal wi- are the result of regressive vowel harmony. Unlike the suffixes.
and the location root ni, it is not mandatory that the 2nd person and 3rd person
non-Euchee pronominals be high before non-high vowels. Although examples of
these heightened pronominals exist in environments which could not produce
harmony to height, the majority are before high vowels.
       In addition to vowel height. BPD is actor to several other phonological
differences. The palatalization rule given in (18) above is active only in BPD.
and the word final /e/ laxing, given in (25) above is less prominent.
I
   The similarity between the Euchee phoneme inventory and those of the Siouan
languages. especially those of the Dakota branch, is probably what lead Sapir to
hypothesize a Euchee-Siouan relationship. Siouan stops contrast by aspiration
(plain and aspirated) and glottalization, although not always by voicing (arguably
a newer innovation in Euchee). However, the Ohio Valley (Southeastern) Siouan
languages, neighbors to the Euchee, had collapsed the glottalized series creating
smaller inventories. Like Euchee, Dakota Siouan languages have a full set of
fricatives, but there are two /m, n/ to three /IJ/ nasal stop phonemes where
Euchee has only one nasal stop phoneme /n/. Siouan languages tend to have 5-
vowel systems. with 3 or more nasal vowels, all contrasting by length. Euchee
shows no phonemic contrast by length (see Sections 1.4 A Note on Vowel Length
and 3.2 Vowel Lengthening in Emphatic, Comparative, and Superlative
Structures).
'  In this case, the 'human' morpheme is the bound root. see Chapter 5 . Section I.
Noun Roots. The 'human' morpheme may also occur as a pronominal prefix
Gatschet ( 1885) recorded the 3' person impersonal pronominal prefix as
voiceless unaspirated [ku-1. ,In addition, Gatschet gave the ISG'person singular
pronominal prefix as [ti-] (actor) and [tse-] (patient). Today these morphemes are
voiced [go-]. [di-] and [dze], although this is due to their initial position (see
discussion in the text). However, the bound root go- meaning 'human' is always
fully voiced.
'  The verb k B 'to make, to do' is often produced [go] or [gal in noun compounds.
As a verb, it retains its ejective and nasal [k'q].
4
   These allophones of /f/ suggest that the modem If/ is recent in the language. It
may have arisen from an earlier *hw or *xw. as did the /f/ in Muskogean. If this
is the case, it could confirm borrowing from Muskogean Nick!as (1994b).
'  Wagner (1934: 305) stated that the epenthetic [n] occurred only before the
pulmonic dental stops. I have found them before any non-biiabial and non-velar
consonant. Wagner (305) also did not find epenthetic nasals before electives. but
 I have found no such restriction.
6
   The velar fricative [x] was described by Wagner (1934: 306) as occumng
""whenever an open or closed unnasalized vowel is followed by a dental or
alveolar stop (d, T, t ) or by a palatal stop (g, K, k)."" (Wagner's notation for the
unaspirated stops is [T] and [K].) Wagner marked [x] (voiceless dorsal-palatal
friiaiivsj oi [&j (voiielcs~vclar fricative) consistently in these snvironmenis
throughout the Yrrchi Tales (1930). Wagner did not describe them in word final
position. From the unpublished notes in phonetic transcription of both Crawford
and Ballard, it is apparent that neither linguist were recording an occurrence of
[x] or [XI.Crawford did mjke a handwritten note in an unpublished phonology
manuscript about the pre-aspiration of some aspirated stops. However, aspirated
stops are the one stop environment that Wagner did not find [x] in.
'   The epenthetic [x] and [h] are more pronounced in some speakers than others.
and they are overall more clear and consistent in female speakers. Wagner
consistently recorded [x] in male speakers as well as female. Therefore, I am
assuming that their prevalence in women's speech today is due to the women
being generally more conservative speakers than the men, and not that it was
pn      of the difference between men's and women's speech styles.
    Crawford (1973) used the symbols [El for the mean-mid front vowel of the lax
oral vowel to distinguish it from the [E] lower-mid front vowel of the lax nasal
vowel.
    Wagner (1934: 371) recorded an [o], or [&pol6], not an /ul or [u].
 loIn a few roots, the underlying vowel phoneme has been lost. Whenever this is
the case, I use the orthographic 'v', used for [D]in contractions and /Q/, as it most
often occur centralized, and [A]in the morphemic representations.
 ' I It is telling that speakers who write in Euchee are diligent in indicating nasal
vowels but never attempt to distinguish length. In addition. when the Euchee
Language Class of Sapulpa was meeting regularly (attended by most of the
 fluent speakers), they would often have discussions about vowel qualities such as
nasality and laxing, such as whether to write [el or [ E ] . However. I never heard
a discussion as to the length of a vowel.
 I' This is fundamentally the same analysis as Crawford. which he gave as
C(C)V(:).
l3  For one speaker, contrxtion is not optional with the animate non-Euchee
classifier. For this speaker, the contracted form marks the singular definite and
the uncontracted form with the penultimate stress marks the plural of all animate
non-Euchee nouns.
IJ
   An alternative hypothesis is that the deletion applies to the onset only and the
features of the deleted onset and the remaining vowel assimilate. For descriptive
purposes, the syllable deletion view is maintained.
        The contraction process in Euchee can accounted for quite elegantly with
feature geometry (Linn 1995). The following is an example, using a deleted we-
3rd singular actor, non-Euchee, pronominal agreement prefix. The we morpheme
is contracted, and the features [+round]and [+back]from the [w] spread left to
the preceding vowel. This accounts for the regular backing and rounding of the
preceding vowels in ule contractions.

and Ballard (1975: 166), and minimally by Crawford (1973: 176). Both Wagner
and Ballard listed the changes associated with the contraction of the non-Euchee
we morpheme. which show a systematic backing and rounding of the vowel
immediately preceding the deleted rve morpheme. Their changes are reproduced
below, in their phonetic transcriptions:

    In this section on contraction, all of the examples from hames Crawford (JC)
are pulled from an unpublished manuscript entitled 'Yuchi' and his notes for this
manuscript. The examples are from his notebooks of text and direct elicitation of
 forms with Mrs. Nancy Wildcat. The manuscript appears to have been for his
class on the Euchee at Georgia State University.

    One speaker does contract the 3"" person singular pronominal /he-/ to /h~-1.
 19
    The vowel shifts for the ho- and hi- contraction look the same as in we-
contraction, with the exception of the diphthong [ao] produced with assimilation
 to /a/. The diphthong [ao] is the sole evidence for the [+round]feature of the /w/
 to spread left. Otherwise, like the /h/ deletion, the roundness is due to the fact
 that all back vowels in Euchee are round.
O' Both [gdspi] 'black person' and [gaka] 'white person' are commonly used with
 all Euchee. even those who do not speak the Euchee language.
 'I This example is from Sadie Skeeter, who was from Duck Creek. Thus. this is
 not an instance of the Big Pond Dialect dialect variation /wid instead of we-.
 "" Rankin (1997; from Ballard (1974:17) gives a set not listed here: side 'naked'
 and sllitle 'bald. bare.' I have checked this with three speakers (representing
 both dialects and both genders). All of them use only one side for both
 meanings, and none have heard shirle. Since some speakers palatalize Is/ before
 a high vowel (see Section 1.2 of this chapter) is probable that difference here is
 due to the phonological palatization rule, not lexicalization.
''   This is apparently the same conclusion that Crawford (1980) was reaching.
 What is interesting is that even though Euchee is not as synthetic as many of the
  languages of the Americas, it still behaves like a polysynthetic language. in the
 sense of Baker (1996). This includes the mandator): pronominal agreement, freer
  word order, and discontuous constituents. Other characterstics are noted
  throughout this work. it shouid be noted that although the ianguage is not tigntiy
 bound together, the process of cliticization is productive. Its relationship to stress
and the continuum with affixation need funher attention.
""    Speakers today cannot analyze this morpheme in the word for 'tax.' However,
 Wagner (ca. 1935) gives the word for 'tax' as [tapihotigokSnC]. In his example,
 the first morpheme [tapi] appears to be 'salt.' I am assuming his earlier
 transcription as [thlebi] is a possible compti onAs salt has always been a valued
 resource in human societies, it is possible that the word refers to payment by or
 for salt. As this idea became obsolete, the language appears to have added sh
 'land' (and in some variations jk'alal 'thing') without having dropped the 'salt.'
 ?-F Many of the locatives are derived from nouns. For example, sk is the
 'ground/earrh' as well as 'down' and /ta/ is 'face' as well as 'on.' This can be one
 reason for their independent status and behavior with the location suffixes.
 26 Gatschet recorded only two Panicle + Verb Constructions, and he wrote the
 panicle separate from the verb (1885: 38). Speck (ca. 1904-1923) discusses
 'general' locatives [locative particles] as separate panicles (p. 41), but then he
 writes them on the verb or almost attached. This was a device he used 'when
 the connection is close' (p. 40). He later gives four 'specialized' locatives as
 'nearer to being verbal prefixes' (p. 48). The difference between hi 'general' and
 'specialized' locatives is not clear, and is not the same has my distinction
 between the generalized location/direction suffixes and the locative particles.
          Wagner, roo, had trouble determining the status of the locative particles.
 The locative panicles were treated as noun suffixes in his 1930 publication. and
  then changed to verb prefixes in the grammatical sketch (1934: 358). Neither
  Ballard nor Crawford discuss the locative particles, but in their field notes they
  are treated as attached to the verb and presumably treated as verb prefixes
  (Ballard ca. 1972-75; Crawford 1972-1973).
7' Since verbs are inflected for person and can be full clauses. technically the
  negative preclitic is also a clause-level clitic. ow eve-(, for the purposes of
  description of Euchee, it is more convenient to group the negative preclitic with
  the other phrase-level clitics.
  28
     This could be argued to be a case of overgeneralization to the habitual
  morpheme [-nil.

       gave it up as impossible. The pronouns of Yuchi was a little more

       time to put on such work.. .'
                       --Ellen Allen (Euchee), Letter to Frank Speck
                       June 1, 1947
       Pronouns 'I,' 'you' 'he/she/it' and so on may be separate words (called
independent pronouns) or they may be attached to a verb or noun (called
pronominal affixes). In Euchee. the pronominals are required even when the
core particpants are indicated by an independenc noun phrase. Thus. pronominals
cross-reference, or agree with, the noun.
       Euchee has a rich system of pronominal agreement on the verb. The
pronominals are prefixed to the verb stem. Each verb must be cross-referenced
for each of the participants in the clause. Because of this, the participants may
not be stated in independent noun phrases. Instead, the verb and its pronominal
agreement are a complete sentence. In fact, after the first reference. or when
the participants are otherwise known to the hearer, speakers do not use
independent noun phrases.
       The role of the participants in a sentence is not marked on nouns in
Euchee. Instead, the pronominal prefixes reflect these roles. There are two sets
of pronominal prefixes distinguished by role: The actor set and the patient set.
The choice of pronominal set is determined by the inherent aspect of the verb.
The actor set is used for all event verbs, and the patient set is used for all verbs
showing n state. Therefore, the Euchee pronominal prefixes reflect a stative-
active system.
       The agreement system also interacts with a prefix which changes the
number of participants in the clause (valence). An historical valence prefix,
presumably *yo-, adds one participant to an event: a one-place (transitive) verb
is changed to a two-place (transitive) verb, and a two-place verb into a three-
place (ditransitive) verb. The valence prefix comes between the verb stem and
the pronominals. In this position, both actor and patient pronominal forms have
contracted with the [+participant]prefix *yo-, and they can not be un-contracted
today. This lexicalized contraction is what has created the abundance of
pronominal forms, or what Wagner (and subsequent linguists) called the four
'series' of pronominals.
       Throughout this work, the pronominal sets are referred to with the 1""
person singular forms di- actor set, dze- patient set, do- actor + participant set
and dzo- - dzyo- patient + participant set, instead of Wagner's terms Series I.
Series 11, etc ... The reason for this is pedagogical: The 1"" person pronominal
gives learners a more direct coirespondence with the set, and the 1"" person
singular is the only pronominal form which can tell a learner which set is in
           '
operation. The meaning of verbs can help rt learner predict which set of
pronouns to use, but there are many exceptions to the pattern. So, learners are
encouraged to elicit the 1"" person singular form when working with a speaker.
This is also the reason that examples throughout this work are given in the I""
person singular form-not    to encourage egocentrism, but to encourage accuracy
and ease in learning.
       Finally, the 3rd person pronimal prefixes show complexity due to the noun
classes. Since every verb must be cross-referenced with the independent nouns.
and since every noun in Euchee has a noun class, the pronominals must agree
with the class of the noun. The noun classes are seen in the 3rd person, when
referring to other people, living beings, places, things. or concepts. In addition.
the noun class morphemes have variations according to the sex of the speaker.
These variations (called honorifics) also affect the form of the pronominal
agreement. With noun class and honorifics, there are eight possible 3d person
singular pronominals. The 3d person pronominal agreement is introduced below,
but a full description of the noun class system and how it interacts with levels of
formality is found in Chapter 6, Section 3.2.","[131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143]"
"       As can be seen, The actor or patient can be behind the verb. This is
ususally done to emphasize the one that is remaining in front of the verb. An
example is in (3a) where the speaker was emphasizing that the man in the
pronominal pref x 'he' did not give up, rather than who he did not give up on. In
(3b), the speaker is focuing on whether or not William was visited, not that

"Calrsative Constructions
       In causative constructions the main clause contains a verb of catrse and
the small clause contains a verb which shows the effect. The causative (main)
clause follows the effect (embedded) clause. This clause order is fixed.
       The causative verbs are (go)thla 'make, cause' and (gojk5 'make, do.' The
verb (gojthla has an irregular stem in the I"" and 2ndperson singular; it is
discussed in Chapter 4, Section 1.4, but repeated in (69) for convenience.

       The example in (70a) below shows the effect verb wa, 'save, leave behind'
followed by the causative verb (gojthla 'to make, cause.' The effect verb is the
embedded small clause, and the cause verb is the main clause. The past tense jZ
follows the main verb. It cannot follow the embedded verb. The main verb
always has actor marking, because the causer initiates and controls the action.
The cause verb also always requires a patient-the       affected participant. The
affected participant is the patient of the cause verb, but it is also the patient or
actor of the embedded clause. In Euchee, the embedded effect verb will
determine the role marking of the affected patient. So, in (70a) below, the
embedded verb wle requires patient marking, in this case dzio-. However, (70b),
the embedded verb ry3 'be angry' requires actor marking, in this case di-.(70)   a. Dziowrele wethla jE

       Speakers do not confuse the causer the affected participant because of the
ridgid clause order. The first pronominal participant is always interpreted as the
affected patient because the effect clause always comes first.

"
       The Euchee language is not demonstrably related to any known
language. Thus, Euchee is classified genetically as an isolate language.
However. there is continuing debate over its possible affiliation with the
Siown language family. Sapir ( 1921) proposed the genetic connection
between Euchee and the Siouan language family. Although he did not
give any evidence for this classification, it has stuck with Euchee as a
classification to either prove or disprove. Few linguists have gone beyond
this in search for other possible relationships.
       Haas (1951). in her pursuit of a larger Gulf family, investigated
Sapir's Siouan-Yuchi classification, but did not find adequate evidence to
support the claim. Haas (1951; 1964) also suggested ties with Proto-
Athabaskan, through its connection to Siouan, but dropped this as well. In
both cases, she limited her work to phonological comparisons of cognate
sets. Elmendorf (1963. 1964) began research into a possible connection
with the Yukian family (using Yuki and Wappo data) in California. Once
again, the link relied on the connection between Siouan and Euchee.
Elmendorf also looked at lexical resemblances, and then used what he
called 'item sets.' which were morphemes with broad phonological and
semantic similarities. In the end Elmendorf made no firm commitment to
any Yuchi-Yukian relationship. More recently Rankin (1996; 1997) has
renewed the interest in proving the Siouan-Yuchi hypothesis, this time
searching for grammatical evidence between Euchee and improved Proto-
Siouan data. The search in this direction continues to yield interesting
information into shared history, whether the shared history is genetic or
sheds light on the nature of contact between two unrelated peoples.
However. no hypothesis has generated sufficient data to place Euchee
firmly into any language family (Crawford 1979; Linn 1997a). and the
question of the classification of the Euchee language is far from being
resof ved.
       To give an idea of the time depth for genetic relatedness of Euchee to
any other language family, we can look at the time depth of the Siouan language
family and its proposed relationship to Euchee. Proto-Siounn is estimated to be
24,000 years from the present. This means that 2-4.000 years ago, all the tribes
comprising the Siouan language family were together speaking one common
language--the proto-language, or the predecessor language. The demonstrated
Catawban branch is distantly related to Proto-Siouan at a time depth significantly
previous to this 4,000 years (Rankin to appear). If Euchee is related to Proto-
Siouan-Catawban, then the relationship must predate the Catawban split by a
time depth great enough to obscure its obvious relationship to Proto-Siouan.
Thus. we are looking at a time depth of at least 8.000 to 10,000 years for a
possible relationship to Proto-Siouan-Cntawban. and probably an equal amount
for any other potential relationship.
        With only very deep genetic relationships possible, there will never be an
abundance of evidence, and it is clear that evidence of deep genetic relationship
can nor come only from phonology and cognate sets but must also rely on
morphological and syntactic evidence. One of the goals of this grammar is to
provide a thorough Euchee description that can aid comparative linguists in
teasing out shared grammatical paradigms. Hopefully, Sapir's Siouan-Yuchi
connection can be firmly established or be safely put aside so that comparative
linguists can look for other connections.
       The Euchee language shows variations due to region and gender.
There are also formal and informal registers. These are noted throughout
the grammar, but are introduced briefly here.
       Two regional dialects are spoken today, and there is some
evidence to suggest that a third existed during the nineteenth century in
Oklahoma. One dialect corresponds directly to the Big Pond Town. This
Tribal Town was the farthest west of the Euchee townsJceremonial
grounds, around present day Depew. Big Pond ceased to be an active
ceremonial ground in the first decade of the 20Ihcentury. Most of the Big
Pond people became part of the Sand Creek Ceremonial Ground. Thus,
most speakers who come (or whose parents came from) from Big Pond or
Sand Creek speak what is called the Big Pond Dialect. The Big Pond
Dialect is marked by regular phonological (vowel heightening) and
morphological variation from what is spoken at Polecat (Sapulpa-
Kellyville) and Duck Creek (Hectorville-Mounds). See Chapter 2 for a
description of these variations. The differences are minimal. and speakers
from the different regions can completely understand each other. Some
speakers are fluent in both dialects.
       Speakers carry no judgements of which dialect is better or worse.
In fact. they stress that both are good Euchee. I use the Euchee spoken at
Polecat and Duck Creek communities throughout this grammar. I do this
only because the differences are easily described in terms of variation
from what is spoken in Polecat and Duck Creek. In addition. the Big
Pond Dialect represents fewer speakers (and a smaller community) today
in comparison with the speakers who come from Polecat and Duck Creek.
I use the abbreviation BPD for examples which are given in the Big Pond
Dialect: otherwise, the Euchee spoken in Polecat and Duck Creek will be
given in all examples.
       There is a good possibility that during Gatchet's time there was
another regional dialect. Gatschet worked in the southernmost area
Euchee habitation, and his notebooks reveal consistent phonological
variations from either the Big Pond Dialect or the PolecatPuck Creek
Euchee in the speech of his first (probably three) consultants. The most
consistent variation is the raising of 101to /u/ in several morphemes. For
example, Gatschet consistently records klc- for the human. 3* impersonal
pronominal. In both dialects today this is pronounced ko-/go- Although
there is not an abundance of evidence for a third dialect, the likelihood of
a third exists as there were at least three distinct and geographically
dispersed Euchee areas at the time of the Tribe's removal to Indian
Territory.
       The language also contains lexical variation, especially in new
words, such 'car,' 'curtain,' and 'television.' Whereas some of the variation
in lexical items is systematic between the two dialects, many instances
are not. They are better attributed to family variations. One reason for
the differences is due to shortening words. Nouns in particular can
become extremely long. and some parts may be dropped off (See Chapter
5). In some cases. a shortened fom has become the standard form in onc
arealfamily, but has remained long in others. In addition, there may be
several ways to shonen a word. Some families have shortened a word in
one way and others in another way, and these shortened forms became
the norm. This is not a new occurrence but has been happening
throughout the history of the language. Another source for the difference
is that many of these newer items appeared in everyday use after the
lribal members were dislocated from each other due to allotment. When
a new cultural item was introduced, they would describe it one way, and
another family described it another way. In most of these cases, they are
similar enough, or accurate enough in their descriptions that speakers can
understand the different words.
       The question of regional dialects was examined in a master's thesis
by Abla (Abla 1994). She concluded that there was no dialect variation
in Euchee. Instead, all variation was confined to lexical variation, which
in turn was due to language loss. However, Abla worked with only three
speakers, two of whom are speakers of one dialect. The other is quite
fluent in both dialects. Furthermore, she concentrated on lexical items
which are variable in the ways mentioned above.
       In addition to regional dialects and variation, Euchee varies
according to the gender of the speaker, known within the community as
'men's and women's speech.' In brief, women use different 3"" person
pronouns than men. However, the distinction based strictly on gender is
not so clear cut. but is better described in terms of formal and informal
speech styles, where women are more formal when referring to men.
This is fully explored in Chapter 6, The Noun and Noun Phrase.
       Formal and informal speech styles, or register, can also be seen in
different speech genres in the Euchee repertoire. Informal speech genres
such as conversation, instruction, personal narrative. and telling ghosl
stories will make liberal use of shonened forms and contractions (see
Chapter 2 Phonology). However. too much contraction, or the inability to
recall or use full forms, is not considered good Euchee. Fluent speakers
called this -slanging the language."" This is becoming more common
today, as some speakers use shortened forms exclusively and are no
longer able to easily reconstruct full forms.
       Formal oratory, such as public speech giving and public prayers. is
noted by the use of full forms. Ceremonial speech is the highest register
and in addition to the use of full forms, it is marked by differences in
phonology. One example of ceremonial speech, the Dance Call, is given
in Appendix I and is analyzed in Chapter 2 (see also Jackson and Linn
2000). Formal genres include ceremonial speech at the ceremonial
grounds, public speech giving, prayers, and sermons. Skillful oratory has
long been a prized quality for the Euchee, and speakers are noted for
their ability to speak formally.","[34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39]"
"Upon finding this note I was immediately relieved to know that I was nor the
only one with these problems, but frustrated by the problems that none seemed to
have overcome.
       More recently there has been renewed interest in Euchee for historical
and comparative purposes. Dale Nicklas re-examined the pronominal classes
(Nicklas 1994). He took a phonological approach to the history of the
pronominal classes instead of the classificatory approach proposed by Ballard.
Nicklas worked on data from Wagner (1930; 1934). And recently, Roben Rankin
(1996, 1997) has reopened investigation into the senetic affiliation of Euchee and
Siouan using Wagner (1934) and Ballard (1973; 1978).
       In summary, although quality data exist on Euchee in manuscript and
notebook form, previous research has not produced a full documentation of any
Icvel of the grammar. and there has been no significant work on the syntax.
Most allention has been paid to the genetic classification of the language. but
this, too, has been limited by insufficient grammatical data.
4. COALSAND CHARA(XERISTICS
                        OF THIS GRAMMAR
       This is the first comprehensive grammar of the Euchee language. I have
tried to include all family and dialect variations whenever possible, but some
unintentional oversights are inevitable in such a work. All languages are
complex and changing, and so there will always be a need for more work into
the subtleties and richness of the Euchee language. It is my hope that this
grammar can be a starting point from which more work on the phonology, syntax.
and pragmatics of the language can be explored.
       The extensive coverage of aspects of the language in this grammar is due
to several factors. First, I have been able to compare my findings and draw on
the work of all those before me. The work of Gatschet, Wagner. Ballard, and
Cnwford have been particularly invaluable to me in this endeavor. Second. I
have tried whenever possible to include not only what is possible in :he
language. but also what is not possible in the language. This has meant untold
hours of grammatical elicitation, and much patience and expertise on the part of
the speakers. It has created some humorous times as well. When testing the
limits of certain morphemes, speakers have laughingly admonished me. 'That is
just plain bad Euchee!' Which of course is what I wanted to know. In addition
to the direct elicitation of forms. I have relied heavily on data from texts. I have
endeavored to use both historical and contemporary textual information. and both
formal and informal narrative styles. Some of these texts are found in Appendix
1.
       Most importantly, I have had continuous interaction with the speakers uf
Euchee for six years. This continuity has given me a depth and breadth into the
language and its use. I have not only been allowed into the Euchee community.
but blessed with the generosity of the people. Many families have lent me their
personal family recordings. Mrs. Phoebe Bucktrot Jones let me use recordings of
her father, the late Chief Madison Bucktrot; Mrs. Sarah Skeeter McNac let me
use a recording of her mother, the late Mrs. Sadie Green Skeeter with ner
mother; The Euchee (Yuchi) Tribe of Indian, Inc. and the family of the late Chief
Jim Brown, Sr., graciously allowed me access to a video tape of Chief Brown;
and Mr. Gregory Bigler has generously let me use hours of video taped
storytelling, along with extensive use of the materials collected by the Euchee
Class of Sapulpa. In addition, Ballard's recordings and transcriptions
substantially increased my base of recorded Euchee speakers, and I have enjoyed
many hours with current speakers reviewing these tapes, as it has brought back
memories for them to hear these voices again.
       I have been fortunate to work with speakers, both male and female. and
their families from all three Euchee geographical areas. This has enabled me to
have a better understanding of the variations that occur within the language. I
had the opportunity to work with the late Mrs. Louanna Bamett, the late Mrs.
Mae Tulsa, and the late Mr. Dimmie Washburn. I have gained many insights
from Mr. Gregory Bigler and Mr. Richard Grounds, who are actively learning the
language. I owe my understanding of the Euchee language to the dedication of
those that have worked closely with me over these years: Mrs. Josephine Wildcat
Bigler, Mrs. Maxine Wildcat Barnett, Mrs. Maggie Cumsey Marsey. Mrs. Martha
Fox Squire, Mrs. Josephine Bamctt Keith. and Mr. Mose Cahwee. I could not
have begun this project without the guidance of the very talented and eloquent
speaker. the late Mr. William Cahwee. His gifts as a natural linguist, and his
willingness to help others, were extraordinary. Finally. Mr. Henry Washbum has
been a most dedicated teacher. His keen ability to son out the impossible and
his patience, often stopping to 'kick that around,' made it possible for me to finish
this work.
       There may be skeptics who do not believe that there could be
fluent speakers of Euchee at the end of the twentieth century. However, I
must stress that not only are all the speakers superb speakers of the
Euchee language, they do not vary significantly either lexically or
-grammatically from monolingual speakers recorded by Gatschet in 1885,
Wagner in 1928-9, or the monolingual and bilingual speakers recorded in
the 1970's Crawford and Baltard. In fact, upon seeing Gatschet's field
notes for the first time, I was struck by how similar his entries are to
mine: I could easily read his entries and found forms in his that I had not
found any other descriptions about in the language."" Ridge's 1826
vocabulary shows inflectional morphemes not published by Wagner, but
certainly appear in my work (and a few were being noted by Cnwford as
well). Additionally, the language has not bee affected by neighboring
languages. There has been remarkably very little borrowing of English
words. nor of Muscogee or Shawnee, the Euchee preferring to create their
own words instead.
       There are some phonological shifts as are noted in Chapter 2, but
even these are remarkably small for the intense contact with English since
allotment in 1895 and Oklahoma statehood in 1907. There is also some
loss in the honorific and familial classification system, which are
commonly susceptible to cultural and language shift. However, it should
be noted that even these changes occur almost solely in the speech of
men. implying that Euchee women are more conservative in their speech
than Euchee men. This phenomenon is well documented in other
languages throughout the world.
       It is my hope that this grammar will be used within as well as
outside of the Euchee community. Since Euchee is not like any other
language spoken today, there is ample data here for testing linguistic
theories for many years to come. In addition, a better understanding of
Euchee can aid in typological studies of the languages of the Americas
and of all human language. And again, perhaps a more complete
grammar can shed light on the history of the Euchee people. In addition
to these. it is my sincere hope hat the Euchee people will be able to use
the grammar in the preparation of language dass materials. I hope adult
language learners can use it as a resource, and all Euchee can pick it up
and feel pride in their heritage language.
       The aim to serve the needs of two distinct communities has made
the presentation of this grammar a hybrid. I have followed the descriptive
tradition as closely as possible. In this way, the data can be useful to
linguists working in any theoretical persuasion. It is not, however, strictly
in keeping with formal descriptive grammars. In attempting to make the
grammar accessible to the members of the Euchee Tribe, I have chosen to
use t e n s more likely to be found in a teaching grammar. Linguistic
terminology is placed in parentheses. I have also found the traditional
categories unwieldy for describing Euchee. The separate designations
'morphology' and 'syntax' simply do not work. and so I have organized the
grammar by building words (derivational morphology) into phrases
(inflectional morphology and syntax) and then into clauses (syntax). It is
my hope that this grammar will aid the trained linguist, the Euchee
language teachers, and the interested lay reader in understanding how the
Euchee language works.","[46, 47, 48, 49, 50]"

the Patient role precedes the Actor role.
                 The 3d person, both the 3rd actor and the 3d patient. is outside of

actor-patient system as well. If the 3rd person patient is with the other patient
prefixes, one would expect the 3d person to have the patient marker dze-, which
it does not. Therefore, it can be assumed that the 3rd person patient is where it
can not get the patient role marking.I9

          '=airport'
       Verbs can be made into nouns. This is called nominalization. The
resulting noun is called either a 'deverbal noun' or a 'nominalized verb.' In
Euchee, any verbal structure can become a noun. In order to do this, the
nominalizer (NOM) -ne is suffixed to the verb. The nominalizer is derived from
the habitual aspect suffix -ne on the verb (see Chapter 5, Section 4.2). Thus,
there is the sense that a stable state of existence occurs when an action becomes
habitual and this state is expressed in the fonn of nominalization. Nasalization is
arbitrary on the nominalizer -ne.IL Speakers of the Big Pond Dialect consistently
pronounce the nominalizer -ni. In fact, this is one of the most distinguishing
phonological characteristics of the dialect.
       The nominalizer -ne is part of the noun stem onto which the inflectional
morphology is suffixed or cliticized. Locatives such as -he or -fa are suffixed to
the end of the noun stem (see Section 3.5)' and class/determiner (Section 3.2)
and plural (Section 3.3) post-clitics can be attached as well.
       In the majority of nominalizations, the suffix -ne is accompanied by the
impersonal go- 'one' pronominal on the verb. Wagner gives go- as the infinitive
form of the verb and states nominalization in terms of the infinitive form.
However. this is not the infinitive, but an impersonal form (see Chapter 3.
Section 2). All verbs can use the impersonal 3""1 person pronominal go-, meaning
'one' and often translated as a generic 'you.' Additional evidence that
nominalization occurs on inflected verbs and not the infinitive is that deverbal
nominals also occur with 3""' person pronouns other than go- and with no pronoun
in cases where the subject is inanimate. Therefore, any verb inflected in the 3d
person can be nominalized, although the majority of nominalizations occur with
the impersonal pronoun go-.","[370, 371, 372, 373]"

3. EARLIERDOCUMENTATION
                     OF THE EUCHEE
                                 LANGUAGE       The Euchee language was first recorded in 1736 by Philip Georg
Friedrich von Reck. The young von Reck led a group of Lutheran
Salzburgers, forcibly expelled from the Catholic Salzburg, to begin a new
colony in Georgia. The colony was funded by the England's Georgia
Trustees. who had funded the New Charles colony under General James
Oglethorpe. who later became the first Governor of South Carolina. The
Salzburgers founded the town of Ebenezer on Ebenezer Creek, a tributary
of the Savannah River, but were later forced to move their settlement to
the head of Ebenezer Creek and the Savannah River. It was here at New
Ebenzer that von Reck made several trips up the Savannah to visit a
Euchee town. He kept a sketchbook of the voyage. the new settlement.
the new flora and fauna he encountered. and the faces, customs. clothing
and implements of the Euchee he visited. Most drawings in his
sketchbook are accompanied by a description, and then words in Euchee
(spelled Uche), Creek, German, and a few with the French or English
words as well. In all von Reck wrote down twenty-two Euchee words and
names. Most of the words are recognizable t ~ d a y . ~
       The first vocabulary was taken down around 1820 by Nathaniel
Ware. This is apparently the vocabulary that was sent to Peter
Deponceau at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania. Deponceau recorded his having received a vocabulary ot
the Euchee language, which he remarked looked like no other language
he had seen before. A copy in Ware's vocabulary in Albert Gastchet's
hand states that the vocabulary was collected 'east of Coosa River' in
Georgia. In 1826, John Ridge, a Cherokee linguist. collected another
vocabulary. Ridge reportedly collected the vocabulary from a Euchee
chief who was visiting Washington (Gallatin, 1836: 9715. However.
Ridge's manuscript of the Euchee (Uchee) and Natchez vocabularies
includes a note from John Ridge to Albert Gallatin in which he gives the
location of the tribe:       The Uchees reside on both sides of the Chatoochie [sic]
       river below Fort Mitchell and between said river and
       Flint River and are supposed to be upwards of 1000
       souls. (Ridge 1826)It is safe to assume, then, that the chief was from the Euchee on the
Chattahoochee River. Ridge collected around 244 words, short phrases
and conjugations and numerals. He noted that the sounds in Cherokee
and Euchee were similar, so he was familiar with most of the sounds he
heard in Euchee that stumped others. Unfonunately, some of the
distinction he probably heard were lost because he used, sometimes
inconsistently, the English orthography to record the Euchee. The Ridge
and Ware vocabularies were published together by Gallatin (1836: 301-
367) as part of a comparative vocabulary of Indian languages.
       Several other shon vocabularies were recorded in the nineteenth
century after the Euchee were removed to Indian Territory. Around 1861.
the missionary Mrs. Alice E.W. Robertson was asked to collect Euchee
vocabulary by General Albert Pike, who was interested in comparing
Euchee and Natchez. She collected some 1300 words. This collection, on
slips at the National Anthropological Archives, is attributed to General
piice.' in i40i. at the end uC his Euchec: field nciiebk, X l k i i Crrnchc;
recopied around 150 of Pike's vocabulary and made additions and notes.
Mrs. Robertson also recorded three transliterated passages from the Bible
in Euchee. Later in the nineteenth, John Wesley Powell collected 26
separate lexical items. The entries consist solely of the name of the tribe,
generic human terms. such as 'man' and woman,' and body parts. He
included plural variations for some words and the 'my' 'your (singular)' and
'his' possessive prefixes for each of the body parts, for a total of fifty
entries. He recorded some aspiration and nasalization but no
glottalization (Powell ca. 1896). L.F. Hadley recorded cardinal numbers
from I-1,000, 16 verbs, 10 adjectives, and 46 nouns, mainly animal
names. He uses, for the most part, the standard phonetic writing system
of the day, and accurately recorded nasalization, but no glottalization or
aspiration. There is also a page-long list of bird names in Euchee from an
unidentified collector. The Euchee names appear alongside a number
which the collector identifies as coming from the 'Bird ~ o o k ' . ~
       The Swiss linguist Albert Gatschet collected the first signiiicanl
body of data on the Euchee language. He worked in Conchany district,
Indian Territory. from November 1884 to March 1885.' Conchany.
mainly a Lower Creek settlement, is the southeastern limit of Euchee
habitation. Gatschet worked with three young boys at a mission school.
most probably Wialaka at Leonard.        However, after a few days he
began work with Mr. David Barnett 'of Kantchati,' and had much contact.

in Leonard. This tield notebook contains 89 pages of words. sentences,
and paradigms, several transcribed song texts, and three transcribed
legend texts: Tsallrsa: Crawfish (Originafthe Earrk),Origin ofthe Y~cclris,
and an untitled lext on the origin of cedar as medicine. In addition to its
obvious value for grammatical analysis, for the first time. a linguist had
accurately recorded nasalization, glottalization, and to a lesser extent.
aspiration throughout the language. In 1888, Gatschet published a brief
synopsis of characteristics of the Euchee language in Science. Despite its
rather old-fashioned rhetoric and terminology, every word of it is accurate.
       In addition to Gatschet's field notes, the National Anthropological
Archives also house several documents on Euchee that he prepared later.
One is a vocabulary collected during his fieldwork in 1885 (MS# 1440-
NAA). The vocabulary follows John Wesley Powell's schedule for the
Introdttcrion to the Study o f Indian Languages. The schedule is not
completed, but does contain 552 words which he pulled from his field
notes. The other is entitled 'Some Grammatic Elements of the Yuchi
Language' (MS# 1594-NAA) and dated 1901. In this manuscript, he lists
numerous examples under headings such as reduplication, substantive
plural. personal pronouns, possessive positions, and so on. In most cases,
there is not a con~pleteset of examples. and there is no discussion or
analysis. However, the document is valuable for its organized data.
Gatschet also recopied the Origin o f the Earrh text under the title Origin o f
Dry Land (published in Gatschet 1893).
       Fmnk Speck began work with the Euchee in 1904. He worked
mainly in the western Euchee settlements of Sand Creek and Big Pond.
He did not record who his primary linguistic consultants were for his
vocabulary and grammatical analyses. However, he collected tales in
Euchee from Ekiq'ane (Ekilnme Cahwee, or Mr. Lewis Long), Mr.
Washington Holder, and Mr. Joe Allen. He collected nineteen tales. a
migration legend, several proverbs and lore. and one narration entitled
'Regarding God' (NAA MS# 1278 and MS# 3133). His text notebooks
comprise a major contribution to the record of the Euchee language.
However, each needs extensive work with a current speaker. to the point
of being re-elicited, as Speck was not consistent in recording nasalization.
aspiration. and glottalization.
       Speck later prepared several manuscripts: 'Verb Conjugations.
Pronouns, sentences, noun declensions' (NAA MS# 1595). "" a 'Vocabulary*
(in NAA MS# 12781, and a 'Sketch of the Yuchi Language' (NAA MS#
1776). While Speck's ethnographic work with the Euchee was
impeccable, his linguistic work falls short. Besides the aforementioned
problems with the phonology, the grammatical sketch contains major
omissions and faulty analyses. For example, he describes the pronoun
system as 'exceedingly simple' (p.12)+and he gives only two noun classes
Ip. 34). the rest he calls 'frequent modifiers.' Unfortunately, Speck's
Euchee language data and analysis is not reliable and can not be used
extensively.
       Speck was Franz Boas' student at Columbia University, and Speck
apparently did not fulfill the Boas mission in terms of linguistics. Thus.
Boas sent his student Giinter Wagner into the Euchee community in the
late 1920's. Wagner spent a total of five months with the Euchee. He did
much of his work with the preacher at Pickett Chapel. Mr. Maxey Simms.
who. like many people of his time in Indian Territory. was trilingual. Mr.
Simrns was half Creek. and he grew up speaking Euchee and Creek
(Muskogee). He learned English later. There is no evidence in any of
his lexts that Mr. Simrns' fluency in Creek or English affected his ability
to speak Euchee. In fact, those who remember him do not recall his
Euchee as anything but excellent, and he was considered a good Euchee
orator in his preaching style. Wagner also worked with Mr. Lany Brown.
and the Clinton family from Sand Creek, including the young Ida Clinton
(Riley). When I met Mrs. Riley at the age of 92, she dearly remembered
'the German' who had come around and collected stories from her and her
parents.
       The amount Wagner collected and transcribed in five monlhs.
without the benefit of modern equipment, is truly phenomenal. He
published a monumental collection of myths, legends. animal tales, and
personal narratives entitled Yuchi Tales (1930). The collection is
invaluable today for their linguistic, historical, and cultural content.
       A sketch of the language followed in 1934. This work has been
the most complete published documentation of the language to date
although the sketch is primarily a n inventory of phonetic sounds.
morphemes, and morphological paradigms. Some aspect and mood
morphemes are omitted o r the description of their placement is incorrect.
Wagner describes the phonetic inventory but does not include a phonemic
analysis. Throughout the following chapters, I will highlight discrepancies
between Wagner's analyses and my own.
       World War 11 prevented Wagner from publishing a planned Euchee
dictionary. He had sent his English-Euchee manuscript to Boas for
editing. This manuscript survives in the American Philosophical Society
Library in Philadelphia. However. the Euchee-English manuscript was
lost with Wagner's other unpublished work and notes.""
       Research on Euchee after Wagner was again sporadic and incomplete.
While working on Creek, Mary Haas collected some Euchee data over several
days in 1940. Her notes remain unpublished. Carl Vogelin sent his student Hans
Wolff to do work on Euchee in 1947. From Wolffs correspondence with Frank
Speck, he was interested in collecting information on the pronominal prefixes for
comparison with Siouan languages. Wolff collected material in Sapulpa for a
few months in 1947, from which he published a brief analysis of the phonemes
and pronominal inventory, which focused mainly on gender variation (1950). and
a n instrucrional namtion text with analysis (1951). In 1950. Emil Benveniste
reinterpreted Wagner's analysis of the two negative preclitics in Euchee using
Wagner's Tales as data.
       James M. Crawford and William Lewis Ballard both worked on the
language in the 1970s. Ballard began his work on Euchee in Georgia with Mrs.
Addie George, but between 1970 and 1975 he completed more extensive
fieldwork in Oklahoma with a variety of speakers. He collected texts from Chief
John Brown, Mrs. Louanna Barnett, Mrs. Segie Bighead. Mr. and Mrs. Nellie and
Ekilarne Cahwee, Mrs. Salo Felix, Mr. Seymour Frank, Mrs. Liza George. Mrs.
Louchar Green, Mrs. Ada Hany, Mrs. Nancy Hany, Mrs. Goldie Littlehead. Mr.
and Mrs. Acey and John Snow, Mr. Bill Staley, Mr. John Tiger, and Mr. Waxin
Tiger. Ballard's recordings are especially valuable as he had the opportunity to
record monolingual Euchee speakers. He has graciously allowed me access to
all of his field tapes and their transcriptions.
       Ballard published two articles on the bound pronominal affixes (1975;
1978). The first contains his phonemic analysis and describes some Euchee
morphophonemics; the second is a further description of the pronominal
inventories and suggests a classificatory scheme for the five sets of pronominal
prefixes. Unfortunately. his trclnscriptions and analyses show reliance on a non-
fluent speaker. His phonological and morphological analyses depart significantly
from all other analyses. including my own. So, although the 1970's saw a
renewed interest in studying Euchee, there were conflicting reports from the
field, which mused even the phonemic inventory to be in question.
       Crawford worked intensively in and around Sapulpa with Mrs. Nancy
Wildcat and with Mr. Seymour Frank and Mr. Neddie Frank in the summers of
1970 and 1971 and briefly in 1973. He published a phonemic inventory (1973).
Regrettably, Crawford died before he was able to complete the dictionary he was
preparing. The American Philosophical Society Library houses his coll~ctionof
notebook. notes. manuscripts, and the thousands of cards he was compiling for
the dictionary. His notebooks and rough sheets of sporadic sorted data with their
brief comments have been extremely valuable to me. Most importantly. they
have been significant in completing a picture of the continuity and changes in
two centuries of Euchee, from Ridge in the early 1800's. Gntschet in 1880's.
Wagner in the 1930's, Crawford in the 1970's to what I have collected in the
1990's. In some ways, Crawford has been an advisor in h e n r i a to me, as his
questions scribbled in comers have often led me into a new (and correct)
direction or confirmed my own suspicions.
       One such note written on a rough sheet is worthy of reproduction here.
Crawford managed to capture the obstacles that have clearly plagued all the

                            TRIBEIN RELATIONTO THEIRLANGUAGE
2.1 BRIEFHISTORYOF THE EUCHEE       Very little will be mentioned here about the Euchee culture as there are
two extensive ethnographies of the Euchee Tribe. Frank Speck (Speck 1909)
published an account of Euchee life and culture as it was in the early part of this
century. At that point, the tribe was still relatively insulated from the intluences
of white culture. and Euchee was still the dominant language. More recently.
Jason Jackson (Jackson 1998) has provided a particularly insightful account of
modem Euchee culture and belief systems. and the enduring oral traditions which
connect everyday Euchee life to the past.
       The Euchee belong to the Southeastern culture area. and more broadly to
the Eastern Woodland culture area. Their culture and economy revolved around
the production of corn and other crops, supplemented with hunting and trade:
identification with a town as the primary social unit beyond the family unit:
social stratification with hereditary chiefs: and shared cosmological. ritual,
medicinal and gender role beliefs and practices with other Woodland peoples.
among others (Jackson 1998).
       The Euchee homeland at the time of European contact in the mid-1500's
was in the southeast of the United States. primarily in the mountainous repion
now comprising eastern Tennessee and the Upper Tennessee Valley. Their
neighbors inclridcd various Xfuskogcan speaking peoples. :he Cherokee
(Iroquoian), various small eastern Siouan tribes, and the Shawnee (Algonquian),
with whom they have had a long-standing alliance and friendship (Jackson 1998).
The Euchee also had a high degree of multi-lingualism common in the Southeast
(Booker 1992). One artifact of this is that they share the common Southeastern
word for interpreter, the Euchee variant being Yarike. From the late 1600's.
bands or towns emerged throughout the Southeast, and the accounts are often
inscrutable and sporadic. Jackson (1998:34-47) provides the first readable
account of the locations and movements of the Euchee towns, along with the
political climate of the times.
       By the mid 1700's, the Euchee were politically allied with the emerging
Creek Confederacy, but it must be emphasized that they remained culturally
autonomous. Benjamin Hawkins, the American Indian Agent to the Southern
Tribes from 1796 to 1816. remarked of the Euchee on the Chattahoochee. ""They
retain all of their original customs and laws and have adopted none of the
Creeksw(quoted in Swanton 1922). During this time, there were at least three
main Euchee towns, with smaller satellite villages and others scattered
throughout the territory of the Creek Confederacy. Perhaps the largest, known as
Euchee Town, was on the Chattahoochee River, Georgia, in Lower Creek
country. This town had ties with the Cussetah as it was formed when the
Cussetah chief, Captian Ellick, married three Euchee women. Several towns are
recorded among the Upper Creek. On the Tallapoosie River, Alabama, many
Euchee lived in the Shawnee-Euchee town of Sauwanogee. There was also a
Euchee town on the Savannah River in South Carolina. In addition, there were
Euchee among the Seminole in peninsular Florida.
       The Euchee were forcibly removed to Indian Territory in the 1832-34
along with the other tribes of the Creek (Muskogee) Confederacy. They settled
in the northwestern pan of Creek (Muskogee) Nation. throughout what are now
Tulsa. Creek. Oklmulgee, and Wagoner counties. Most likely, the early Euchee
settlements corresponded directly to towns in the Southeast. but these links are
not known today. In 1884, linguist Albert Gatchset recorded at least eight
Euchee towns and settlements: Snake Creek, Polecat Creek, Deep Fork Creek,
Black Jack Town. Wialaka, Duck Creek Town, Big Pond Town, Red Fork. and
the 'Shawnee-Yuchis' living west of the other settlements (p. 80). Most Euchee
continue to live in the original settlement area. Today, there are three distinct
areas, each with a ceremonial ground and/or church as its heart. These are
Polecat Ceremonial Ground and Pickett Chapel Indian United Methodist Church.
near the municipalities of Kellyville and Sapulpa; Duck Creek Ceremonial
Ground, close to Hectorsville and Mounds; and Sand Creek Ceremonial Ground
and Muttoloke Indian United Methodist Church, near Bristow and Depew.
       Residing inside of the Creek (Muscogee) Nation, the Euchee remained
isolated from white culture, and indeed from complete absorption into Creek
culture, as they remained aloof from their neighbors (Jackson 1998: 49-50).
Enrollment of Indians, and the allotment of Indian lands began in 1895, and
many Euchee men were actively involved in fighting against federal troops
enforcing allotment. The fragmentation of the Euchee settlements through
allotment, followed by the influx of white settlers when Oklahoma was given
statehood in 1907, was the first step in language loss. The mission school system
was established in the Muscogee (Creek) Nation during the nineteenth century.
but after allotment increasing numbers of Euchee attended these boarding
schools. Many young Euchee were enrolled in the Euchee Mission Boarding
School in Sapulpa, Oklahoma, but many others were sent to schools throughout
rhe state. including Sequoyah (in Tahlequah), Chilocco (in north central
Oklahoma), Dwight Mission (near Vian), Wialaka (now spelled Weleetka. in
Leonard). and Eufala Girls School (Eufala). Although students of Euchee
Mission Boarding School did not tell of the kinds of beatings associated with
native language use reported at other schools, the school required English and
the boarding school system itself took students outside of the home for extended
periods of time. Later the public schools demanded knowledge of English. Mrs.
Josephine Keith, like most speakers today, remembers not understanding her
classes during the first year of public school, and being embarrassed because she
could not participate in the same ways a s the other children. In many families,
the older siblings actively taught English a t home to their younger brothers and
sisters in order to keep them from repeating their humiliating experience, and
many of these younger children never fully socialized in Euchee.
       Still, by the 1930's. while English became the language of the market.
work, and school, Euchee remained the dominant language of most Euchee
homes. Yet, World War I1 brought with it an end to Euchee-English bilingualism.
Although the many Euchee had participated in the Civil War and World War I. it
was their active involvement in World War 11 that ushered in the rapid decline of
the language. Nearly every able bodied Euchee man enlisted, and many Euchee
women went into Tulsa and as far a w a y as Los Angeles to participate in the war
effort. Mrs. Josephine Wildcat Bigler was a 'Rosie the Riveter' in Tulsa during
the war. Many of these women met men from outside of their tribe. married.
and moved away from the community. Among those remaining in Euchee
country, many remained in the work force after the war and were thus away
from their families and community during much of their everyday lives. The
men, too. returned to take jobs as truck drivers or laborers outside of their
immediate communities. The traditional agricultural economy that bound them
tosether was broken. The fragmentation of their economy after World War I1
was devastating to the coherence of earlier patterns of community life. Many
also returned to find that they were no longer thinking in Euchee. Mr. William
Cahwee often spoke of the fact that he returned from the war in the Pacitic
unable to speak fluently with his father Ekilarne. He vowed then to never forget
his language. but many others did not make this conscious and continuing effort.
       Finally. some parents, having themselves endured hard economic and
social conditions in dustbowl Oklahoma before the war, and saw the economic
opportunities in white society, actively suppressed Euchee in their homes. Many
middle-aged Euchee today report that their parents spoke the lan-pige only
among themselves and spoke English with their children. To these young people.
Euchee became a code language, something that adults used when they did not
want their children to understand them.
      Awareness of the necessity to keep their language began about
this same time. There has been a continuing effort of dedicated people to
reach the language for many years. Chief Madison Bucktrot. Sr.. Chief of
Sand Creek Ceremonial Ground, taught Euchee in the public school at
Gypsy. Oklahoma, in 1953. Mr. John Snow held community language
classes in October through January of 1975-6. About the same time. Mrs.
Sadie Skeeter began holding classes for her grandchildren and other
interested children. The classes met at Liberty Mounds school for several
ycars. Mrs. Addie George also taught classes through the 1970-80's.
primarily for her family but open to anyone. Mr. Lany Cahwee has
incorporated Euchee into his classes in Kellyville public schools for many
ycars now. Finally. Mrs. Linda Harjo has incorporated Euchee curriculum
into hcr Title 9 program in Sapulpa Public Schools.
       Around 1990. two classes began for adults which have been
particularly influential in the current movements to revive the language
and maintain its use in ceremonies. Mr. William Cahwee began classes
in Glenpool. The classes met once a week for several years and included
tapes made by Mr. Cahwee on the material covered in class. In Sapulpa.
Mrs. Maggie Marsey began classes with the help of Mr. Gregory Bigler.
an active learner of the language. The two classes merged and became
known as the Euchee Language Class of Sapulpa. At first they decided
on a consistent writing system for the ciass and using this system, they
generared much vocabulary. They quickly realized that words were
usclcss without knowing how to put them into sentences. Consequently,
the class developed several books filled with words. sentences. analyzed
parts of sentences, small dialogues, and texts. The class also grew into a
much-needed social occasion for Euchee speakers to get together and
speak the language. For many of them, it was the only time during a
week that they got a chance to speak their language, and for some who
had not spoken in years it gave them the opportunity to become fluent
again.
         The class took on other projects as well. They sponsored their first
Language Camp in 1993. The two-day camp was well-attended and
spurred an active interest in language revival in the community. One of
the most significant outcomes of the camp was a beginning class for
children. This class, too. combines speakers, primarily Mr. Henry
Washburn, Mr. Mose Cahwee and the late Chief Jim Brown Sr., and Mr.
Dimrnie Washburn. with younger and more active teachers, Mr. Richard
Grounds and Mrs. Linda Harjo. The classes have been successful and
have included frequent camps, fieldtrips. classes during the ceremonial
cycle on the Ceremonial Grounds, and garden projects. in addition to the
language camps, ihe Euchee Language Class of Sapulpa began a Master-
Apprentice program for the young teachers.
         In the spring of 1997, 1 conducted a Language Status Survey of the
Euchee language. This survey was initiated by the Euchee (Yuchi) Tribe
of Indians. Inc., as panial fulfillment of their Administration for Native
Americans Planning Grant. At that time, there were fifteen fluent
speakers. all over the age of 65. Today there are thirteen. Six speakers
are male; two of these are too elderly to do language work; two are out
of state and have little communication with other Euchee. This is
important since Euchee makes grammatical distinctions based on the
oender of the speaker. The health of each of the speakers, and thus their
E
ability to panicipate in data collection, varies from day to day.
Fortunately, the remaining speakers of Euchee are highly committed to
reviving and preserving their language. They participate as actively as
possible in community efforts to maintain the language. There are more
semi-speakers, people in their middle years who understand the language
but have little to no speaking ability.
      Like other moribund languages, the environments in which the
language is used has diminished over the years. There is still one
household in which Euchee is the primary language of daily
communication. This household consists of two adults over 60. Outside
of events specifically designed for language use, everyday Euchee is still
heard whenever two or more speakers are together. This may be at
funerals, in the kitchen at Pickett Chapel, one family camp at Polecat
Ceremonial Ground, or other community events. Prayers at any
community or family meai are preferred in Euchee if a speaker is in
attendance. Story-telling, whether traditional animal tales. ghost stories.
or personal narratives is rare now. The legends and mythology remain in
oral tradition but only in English. Speech $vine in Euchee at public
events does not appear to be common today. although it was as late as
1996. Extended ceremonial oratory at the ceremonial grounds and formal
preaching in Euchee no longer exists. Preaching in Euchee took place on
a regular basis as late as 1978. At the Ceremonial Grounds. danct: cclis.
dance encouragements, leader announcements and other shorter ritual
genres continue to be conducted in Euchee. However, these tend to be
highly ritualized or memorized text today, with the notable exception of
two men who are actively learning the language (Jackson and Linn 2000).
      Although there is not a community-wide effort to revive Euchee as
a daily language, there is a great appreciation for Euchee as the
community's ancestral language. Euchee is felt to be the preferred
language for ritual at the ceremonial grounds, for prayer and song in the
United Methodist Church services, and for blessings in family and
community contexts. Mrs.Maxine Wildcat Barnett attests that to sing and
pray in Euchec is the best way for her to communicate with God.
Speakers are vocal in belief that if the language is lost, then their identity
is lost. As Mr. William Chawee stated, We will just be Indians, not
Euchee.""","[27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"

agreement. Nearly all adjectives are states in Euchee, and therefore require
patient pronominal agreement. See Chapter 3, Section 3 for states and patient
pronominal prefixes. They can take aspect suffixes, and they may have tense
and mode phrases following them. However, they require either the verbalizer
-2 or the -1e (or the emphatic -:le, see below) in order to function as a clause.
These endings set them apart from other verbs. Because of this, it is convenient
and appropriate to refer to them as adjectives and a separate part of speech from
verbs.",[445]
"For an example of the possible three-place verb orders, see Chapter 3, example
(77b).
         Some verbs require a location, such as the verb 'put' or 'go to.' Required
