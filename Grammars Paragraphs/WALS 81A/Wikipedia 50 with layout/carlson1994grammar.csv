7.1. Basic word order in simple clauses
The three basic types of simple clause all share in common the constituent
order subject—predicate. The subject in Supyire is typical from a cross-lin-
guistic point of view, and has the most common subject properties noted in
Hopper and Thompson (1980). From a pragmatic point of view, it is the un-
marked topic of the clause (see Giv6n 1984: 139). From a semantic point of
view, it is for the most part the participant which is highest on the scales of
animacy and control. From a syntactic point of view, apart from the obvious
word order criterion (which in the context of this section would be a circular
identification), it is the noun phrase which controls reflexivization (chapter
10, section 10.4), ""equi-NP"" deletion in complements of modality verbs (see
chapter 11, section 11.2), switch reference (see chapter 15, section 15.3),
and the ""logophoric"" alternation between anaphoric and emphatic pronouns
in complements of verbs of speech (see chapter 11, section 11.5.1). All these
are typical syntactic properties of subjects cross-linguistically. In addition,
the subject is the only syntactic role in Supyire which requires a resumptive
pronoun when fronted for focus (see chapter 12, section 12.1.1). Following
are examples of each of the three major clause types, illustrating the order
subject—predicate.  (1) a. identificational:

1.2. The language
Supyire belongs to the Senufo group of the Gur family of Niger-Congo. Al-
though no systematic reconstruction has yet been done, preliminary evidence
indicates that the Senufo languages can be divided into northern, central, and
southern branches. Supyire is the southernmost member of the northern
group, which also includes Minyanka (spoken in Mali to the north of Supyi-
re), Nanerge, and Sucite (spoken in Burkina Faso). All of these languages
are quite closely related to each other. Supyire is separated from the central
Senufo languages to the south by a narrow band of Mande-speaking people.
  The Kampwo dialect described in this grammar is only one of several. At
this point little is known of the degree to which the dialects diverge from
each other. Within the Kampwo area the speech is fairly homogenous, and I
had no difficulty in communicating with people 30 kilometers to the south or
2   Chapter 1: Introduction
20 kilometers to the north of Farakala. Further afield, however, there are no-
table differences which call for investigation.
  The Senufo languages are like other Gur languages in having a suffixal
noun class system. They are atypical, however, in having a word order like
that of Mande languages, to which they are geographically contiguous. The
chief peculiarity of this word order is the placement of the direct object be-
fore the verb, but of all indirect objects after the verb. This order is an areal
phenomenon, being also shared by Songai to the north, and, to some extent,
by the Kru languages to the south.
  The Senufo languages resemble the Mande languages in numerous other
ways besides word order. Many of these similarities are noted in this gram-
mar, and many more would doubtless come to light if the matter were
studied systematically. It is fairly clear that there has been a long history of
bilingualism in Bambara (or its diaspora Jula) among the Supyire. Many
lexical items and quite a few grammatical ones have been borrowed from
Bambara, and it is probable that several grammatical constructions are
caiques on the corresponding Bambara constructions. An effort has been
made to indicate Bambara borrowings in the examples. The Bambara forms
given are taken from Bailleul (1981), though it should be borne in mind that
the dialect recorded there is standard Bambara, whereas the source dialects
for Supyire loans are normally Gana and Sikasso Jula.","[24, 25]"
"
1.6. Typological characteristicsGiven the typological aims of this grammar, it may be helpful at the outset
to mention some ways in which Supyire may be interesting. In the
phonology, the complications of the tonal system are certainly worthy of
note, in particular the system of four phonemic tones within a three-level
register. In syntax, the word order (with direct object preceding the verb but
all indirect objects following it) alluded to in section 1.2 above is of interest.
Another point of interest is the extensive use of serial verb constructions in
many parts of the grammar.
  In complex constructions, the rarity of true embedding is of note. Comple-
ment clauses and relative clauses are placed alongside the ""main"" clause in
a nearly paratactic way. The beginnings of embedding can be detected in
both cases, showing that Supyire is at an interesting stage of syntactic
development. Finally, clause chaining is used in connected discourse,
especially narrative, with a system of switch-reference conjunctions unique
to Senufo languages.",[28]
"The basic structure of verbal clauses is thus: (6) SUBJECT ΤΑΜ (DO) VERB (PN) (INDIR OBJS) (ADVERB)The relative order of the postverbal elements is variable, and a single clause
may have more than one indirect object.
  It should be pointed out that any nominal and many adverbs in a copular or
verbal clause may be moved to the beginning of the clause for focus pur-
poses. See chapter 12 for a discussion of this construction. Note that this
means that the subject must be defined (in structural terms) not as the first
nominal of the clause, but as the nominal which immediately precedes the
copula or the auxiliary.",[262]
"
1.5. Aims of this grammar
The principal aim of this grammar is to provide a description of the basic
structures of Supyire within a functional-typological framework. 1 Some of
the basic assumptions of this approach are discussed briefly in this section.
4   Chapter I:   Introduction
   The first assumption is that a language is most insightfully described in
functional terms. Language behavior (like most human and indeed animal
behavior) is for the most part goal directed and purposeful. The forms of a
language (its lexical items and syntactic structures) are analogous to tools.
Accordingly, this description frequently employs the verb 'use'. Speakers
are said to use such and such a construction in order to express such and
such a meaning. More than convention is involved in the linking of a given
form with a certain range of functions. Just as flint is a better material for
cutting than a vine, while a vine is a better material for tying something than
flint, so a given linguistic structure is better suited for some jobs than for
others.
   In line with the functional approach is the conceptualization of language as
""code"". In a basic sense the forms of a language exist for the sake of what
they are used to express and not vice versa. The use of the concept of
""code"" can be misleading, however, if it conjures up the idea of an arbitrary
link. The language code, far from being arbitrary, is pervasively shaped by
what it is coding. This shaping results in the essentially iconic nature of
syntax.
   Within a code as complex as a natural language, subparts are linked in
subsystems in highly complex ways. Another basic assumption guiding this
description is that it is useful to compare different languages to see how the
subparts interact with each other. It is essential to this typological approach
to describe phenomena in comparable terms. While like any language
Supyire has particularities which require special treatment, a concerted
effort has been made to use generally accepted terminology which will
facilitate cross-linguistic comparison.
   A final guiding assumption is that the current state in a language cannot be
understood apart from its history. To return to the tool analogy: in order to
accomplish a novel task, a tool user will select and perhaps modify some
tool whose form is appropriate for the new task. In general, one does not
create a totally new tool from scratch. Thus I may use a screwdriver to pry
off a lid, but would be unlikely to try to perform the same task with a plastic
bag. The plastic bag, however, might come in handy to cover a hole in my
thatch, where a screwdriver would be useless. Neither of these tools was
originally designed for the purpose to which I put them, but their forms
(dictated by their original functions) lend themselves to ""metaphorical""
extension to perform other functions. In a similar way, speakers use the
forms of their language to perform novel tasks.
   In order to patch my roof well, I may split open the plastic bag and spread
it out. Although I have modified its form to adapt it to its new function, it
still retains many of the basic characteristics and limitations of its original
form. Historical change in language is analogous. Though a given form may
take on a new function, and be modified in the process, it often continues to
                                               1.6. Typological characteristics   5retain many of its original characteristics long after the original function is
forgotten.
  The historical study of Senufo languages is in its infancy. All too often in-
formation which might elucidate peculiarities of Supyire grammar is simply
unavailable. Every effort has been made to indicate etymologies where pos-
sible, and quite a bit of speculation about historical antecedents is included.
Much of this will doubtless be superseded, and all speculations should be
treated as such.","[26, 27, 28]"
"15. There is a large body of literature on so-called ""indirect speech acts"".
    See in particular Brown and Levinson (1978), Levinson (1983), and the
    comments in Givön (1990, chapter 18).
16. The form of this question is highly unusual. The interrogative deter-
    miner obviously belongs with the initial noun phrase, but is separated
    from it by the rest of the clause. No other example of this sort occurs in
    the corpus, nor was I able to induce anyone into producing parallel
    examples. Pücirii are members of ones patrician who have been mar-
    ried. Since most villages consist only of members of one patrician plus
    their wives (children belong automatically to their father's patrician),
    and since the clans are exogamous (at least in theory), the adult female
    members of one's patrician usually reside in another village. On the
    verb wyisee chapter 13, note 5.
736 Notes: Chapter 15Chapter 15: Interclausal connections
1.  See chapter 14, note 5.
2.  Kile is the creator Sky-God. This example is taken from a folktale in
    which monkey decides to eat a human being, but determines to do it in a
    dense thicket where he is not able to see the sky when he looks up (and
    consequently the sky/God cannot see his evil deed).
3. For the use of the conditional in a relative clause, see chapter 13, sec-
    tion 13.4.2.
4. See Thompson and Longacre 1985:204f for a discussion of the phe-
    nomenon of extensive borrowing of subordinating morphemes. Such
    borrowing seems to be at least as extensive in Supyire as in the two
    Mexican languages cited by Thompson and Longacre: Yaqui and Isth-
    mus Zapotec.
5. These are common names of dogs, borrowed from Bambara.
6. See chapter 9, note 12.
7. Compare also the use of 'and' to mark conditionals in early modern
    English.
8. Dügüsön 'village festival' is borrowed from Bambara dügü 'village,
    town' and son 'worship, offer sacrifices'. The Supyire term is käsunno
    (from känhä 'village' + sun 'offer sacrifices', borrowed from the Bam-
    bara verb above). The denotatum is an annual festival to thank the tute-
    lary spirits of the village (the 'jinns') for favors during the past year and
    to pray for the coming year.
9. Bäärä 'work' is borrowed from Bambara baara 'work'.
10. This seems to be a caique on the Bambara conjunctive phrase ο bee n'a
    ta 'this all and its own'.
11. ΚίΙέ'wrench' is borrowed from French c/e/'wrench'.
12. Mekanishyingiri 'mechanics, repair work' is formed from mekanishyen
    'mechanic' (borrowed from French m6canicieti) by the addition of a
    syllable of unknown origin (plus the gender 4 suffix -rV).
13. Note the similar placement of the conjunction de in ancient Greek,
    which has a comparable function.
14. IJkää is underlyingly /hkälä/. The origin of the extra syllable [la], not
    found in the standard Bambara form hka, is at present unknown.
15. Y5 is the Supyire equivalent of the ubiquitous ο found in many if not
    most West African languages. See Singler (1988).
16. This is evidently an archaic use of the conjunction kä, which in ordinary
    language is used as a different subject narrative connective, and cannot
    be combined as here with an imperfective verb without any auxiliary.
    The current function as a different subject marker accords well with an
    etymology pointing to an earlier function as a marker of disjunction.
    The archaic nature of the present example is due to its being a proverb.
17. See chapter 13, note 7.

                              Simple clauses
In this chapter the structure of simple (non-complex) clauses will be de-
scribed. Simple clauses fall into three basic categories based on the type of
predicate they have: those with pronominal predicates (identifier pronouns),
those with copular predicates, and those with verbal predicates. Aside from
this basic categorization, verbal clauses can further be subclassified accord-
ing to the semantic and pragmatic nominal roles (""cases"") that they have.
  After an initial section dealing with the order of constituents in a simple
clause, each of the above categories will be described in turn. The final
category (verbal clauses) comprises by far the greatest variety of subtypes,
and will consequently occupy the bulk of this chapter. The chapter con-
cludes with a section on optional nominal case roles and another on adverbs.","[259, 260]"
"
14.2.4. ' What about...?' questionsThere is a type of question in Supyire which solicits more information than
merely a comment on the truth of the proposition as in a yes/no question, but
does not ask for the hearer to identify a particular referent as in constituent
questions. The speaker rather asks a generalized question 'What about...? 1 ,
and the specific information desired is usually obvious from the context. The
question is marked with the final interrogative particle      which in the ex-
amples below will be glossed 'what about* in order to distinguish it from the
interrogative particles discussed in previous sections.
  There are two subtypes of 'what about1 questions. The first type consists
simply of a noun phrase with the interrogative particle appended. The ad-
dressee must infer from the speech context what information about the refer-
ent of the noun phrase the speaker is seeking. In the following example, a
master poses the question to his slave, who had previously been ordered to
fill the master's snuff box. The question therefore means something like
'What have you done with my snuffbox? 1 :  (68) Mii batärji           dt?
         my snuff.box.DEF what.about
         'What about my snuffbox?'",[568]
"  ""Semi-embedding"" as illustrated in the above examples cannot simply be
dismissed as ""performance"" errors. They are not examples of restarting a
sentence in midstream. Speakers do not regard them in any way as odd or in-
elegant, and willingly supply additional examples.
  It appears, then, that this type of construction represents the beginning of a
process which may end in the full embedding of relative clauses. In the pre-
sent state of the language, however, relative clauses are like the complement
clauses in being neither embedded nor independent. Like complement
clauses, they are marked as subordinate by a specific morpheme, in this case
the relative clause marker k6. Internally they are further marked by either
the fronting of the relativized noun phrase or the use of a relative pro-

that the relative clause cannot simply be analyzed as some sort of topic
clause adjoined by simple parataxis to another independent clause.

                                 Chapter 14
                      Non-declarative speech acts
Most if not all languages distinguish three major sentence types: declarative,
imperative, and interrogative (Sadock and Zwicky 1985). Supyire, in com-
mon with all the Senufo languages, conforms to this generalization. The bulk
of this grammar is devoted to declaratives, in conformity with descriptive
tradition. This tradition is probably due to the twin factors of the greater
text-frequency of declaratives and to the greater degree of syntactic elabora-
tion usually found in declaratives (Givön 1990, chapter 18). This chapter in
contrast is devoted entirely to the description of the other two sentence
types.
  The three major sentence types can be conceived of as grammaticalized
means of performing three major functions of language: to convey informa-
tion (declarative), to give orders, requests, invitations or the like
(imperative), and to elicit information (interrogative). In Supyire, as in many
languages, imperatives are principally distinguished by what they lack
(subject, auxiliary) in comparison to other clause types. There is also one
auxiliary used exclusively in a subtype of imperative. Also dealt with in this
chapter is the use of the subjunctive to accomplish a politer manipulation
than the ""bare"" imperative.
   Questions in Kampwo Supyire are a more marked sentence type than either
imperatives or declaratives. All questions have some sort of interrogative
particle at the end or, in a few cases, at the beginning of the sentence. In ad-
dition, in constituent (""wh"") questions, the use of question words and, in the
majority of questions, the use of the cleft focus construction also mark the
clause as different.
   A further characteristic distinguishing both imperatives and interrogatives
from declaratives is the use of the non-declarative set of first and second
person pronouns (for the form of these pronouns see chapter 5, section
5.1.1.2). These special pronouns are not obligatory in imperatives and ques-
tions, and in fact, ordinary first and second person pronouns are even more
common in these sentence types. Further, the first person singular non-de-
clarative pronoun na cannot be used as subject. On the other hand, the non-
declarative pronouns cannot be used in declarative sentences, except in three
functions: as reflexive genitive possessors (see chapter 6, section 6.2.1), as
genitive possessors in vocatives (first person only), and in exclamations. Ex-
amples of the latter two functions are:
518   Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech acts (1) a. vocative, genitive possessor

"  The etymology of ni is unknown at present. This type of purpose clause
can only be equi-subject with the main clause. The ni purpose marker is
followed by the future prefix, a fact obscured in the above example since a
direct object immediately follows it. Following is a clearer example, with

Chapter 12: Focus and topic constructions1.    The absence of any copula in the affirmative, and the absence of any
      relative clause morphology or syntax, makes the ""cleft"" look very much
      like Y-movement. The construction seems in fact to cover the pragmatic
      functions of both clefts and Y-movement (i.e. both strong and somewhat
      weaker contrast). I have chosen to label it cleft because of the use of a
      copular element in the negative, and because of the use of a place-hold-
      ing pronoun when the subject is focused. As pointed out by Givön
      (1990, chapter 16), in a subject initial language (like English or Supy-
      ire) a true Y-movement construction should not be able to code focus on
      the subject, since it is already in initial position.
2.    On the face of it this contradicts some predictions based on the
      ""accessibility hierarchy"" (see Keenan and Comrie 1977, Keenan 1985).
      Pronoun retention is typically lower on the hierarchy than gapping.
      Supyire is thus unusual in using pronoun retention with subject, which
      is the highest point on the hierarchy, and gapping with direct object,
      which is lower. Because of the peculiar word order of the Senufo lan-
                                                        Notes: Chapter 12   731     guages (with an auxiliary between the subject and direct object), gap-
     ping is an ideal strategy for direct object, but not at all for subject.
3.   Ordinarily a direct object consisting of a simple anaphoric pronoun
     should take the (floating) low tone of the perfect auxiliary. The reasons
     why it does not do so in this example (and a handful of others) are un-
     clear, but probably have something to do with the exclamatory nature of
     the utterance.
4.   The basic meaning of wyere (definite wyeire) is 'leaves'. Herbalist
     practices have led to the extension of the word to cover both 'medicine'
     and 'poison', as here.
5.   Lakyärä is borrowed from Bambara lakari 'antidote'.
6.   Säsä is an intensifier that occurs only with ηά/ηέ 'now'. The combina-
     tion means 'right now', 'this instant'. Its use by the speaker of the ex-
     ample is an exaggeration, since the person referred to had died several
     months previously.
7.   The high tone on the subject pronoun is also found in the realis (high
     tone) complement clause type (see chapter 11, section 11.3). The high-
     low tune on the identifier pronoun is surprising, since normally these
     pronouns, which have a strong mid basic tune, simply allow a preceding
     high to spread onto them, wiping out the mid tone. The source of the fi-
     nal low remains unexplained at present.
8.   The genitive particle in a few cases is not used for focus as in the above
     examples, but to show that a genitive construction is intended in certain
     cases where there could be another interpretation. Thus, since some-
     times adjectives can be used substantially, occasionally the combina-
     tion noun + adjective could actually be intended to be genitive + noun.
     The following phrase could thus have the two meanings indicated:        Dähä nin-jwogi
        Daha ADJ-take.DEF(GlS)
        a. 'Daha taken' (e.g. in Ί saw Daha taken from the room.')
        b. 'Daha's taking' i.e. his salary     The use of the genitive particle unambiguously forces the second inter-
     pretation, but does not necessarily indicate any focus on the genitive
     noun:        Dähä ' ύ        nin-jwoiji
        Daha GEN ADJ-take.DEF(GlS)
        'Daha's salary'     A difficulty of another sort arises in participial nominalizations in which
     the deverbal adjective is accompanied by an adpositional phrase. Since
     the adpositional phrase intervenes between the genitive and its head, the
732    Notes: Chapter 13      only way to show that a genitive construction is intended is to insert the
      genitive particle in front of the head noun:         pddrji      nu-vworogi       lwoh6     e
         catfish.DEF ADJ-come.out.DEF water.DEF from
         υ    tunmp6
         GEN noise.DEF
         'the noise of the catfish coming out of the water'    Here again there is no hint of any kind of special focus. A possible ex-
    planation of the distribution of functions of the genitive particle may be
    that it was formerly used in all genitive constructions, but was subse-
    quently lost in ordinary genitives. It was retained in those cases where it
    was necessary to indicate that a genitive construction was intended, and
    also in those cases where there was a special focus (accompanied by in-
    tonational stress) on the possessor noun phrase.
9. This does not hold for left dislocated time phrases. See below for exam-
    ples of these.
10. The cicahagikii are dried gourds with the seeds still inside them. They
    are played by a chorus of women who sing to their own accompani-
    ment. The primary meaning of the word translated 'play' is 'hit', which
    is entirely appropriate for a percussion instrument.
11. Part of the funeral celebration is a Mast dance' for the deceased, in
    which the body is danced through the village by six young men.","[753, 754, 755]"

8.3.1. Deictic motion       verbs  Motion verbs, usually accompanied by a locative indirect object or a loca-
tive adverb, are often used as V2 in order to indicate the direction of the ac-
tion designated by VI. They often thus are equivalent in information value
to prepositions in a language like English. The most commonly used verbs
for this purpose are: pa 'come', kare 'go', jye 'enter', fworo 'exit', dugo
'ascend', tigd 'descend', and y)r) 'get up, leave'. Sometimes cwo 'fall' is
also used to indicate downward motion. A very common combination is the
verb / w i ' t a k e ' plus pa 'come' or kare 'go' to mean 'bring' or 'take':  (25)    a. Kä    u    ύ    '      wyiriyi      Iwb    ä        pa       nähä.

10.1. Transitivity in Supyire
From a purely structural point of view, it is easy to distinguish transitive
from intransitive sentences in Supyire merely by the presence versus the ab-
sence of a direct object. Subjects and direct objects are easily distinguish-
able by their fixed position in the sentence. 1 It is now generally agreed,
however, that a merely structural account of transitivity is hopelessly inade-
quate. As a means of making cross-linguistic generalizations, categories
such as subject and direct object run into all sorts of difficulties, since a
structural definition valid for one language is often not applicable to another.
There is a considerable literature on this topic (see in particular Keenan
1976, Hopper and Thompson 1980, Givön 1984, 1989, DeLancey 1987).
Two major points have been established in this literature. The first is that
transitivity from a functional point of view is a scalar phenomenon and not a
binary one. The second is that to gain a clear picture of what the function of
a given syntactic role is, one must take into account both semantic and
pragmatic factors.
  Assuming the correctness of this approach, what can be said of the roles of
subject and direct object in Kampwo Supyire? The subject is a largely prag-
matic role, just as it is in languages like English and French (see Giv6n
1983, 1984: 139). This means that one cannot simply equate the syntactic
role of subject with a semantic role such as agent. The subject of a clause
can in fact also be the semantic patient, recipient, or even some other role.
The choice of which semantic role is to be subject is a pragmatic one. Hav-
ing said this, it is necessary to affirm that the hierarchy of ""accessibility"" to
400   Chapter 10: Transitivity and voicesubject (see Keenan 1976, Keenan and Comrie 1977, Givön 1984) which has
been found valid for other languages is also valid for Supyire:  (1) Agent    >   Recipient >      Patient >   OtherAccording to this hierarchy, subjects are more likely to be agents than they
are to be any of the other roles. From a pragmatic point of view, of course,
agents tend to be more interesting and relevant, and are therefore better
candidates on the whole for the position of subject.
  The choice of direct object, in contrast, is largely semantic: it is almost
always the patient. This sets Supyire apart from languages such as English
which freely allow recipients, and sometimes even roles lower on the hierar-
chy, such as instrumental or locative, to be ""promoted"" to direct object (the
so-called ""dative shift"" rule). In such languages the direct object can be de-
fined in pragmatic terms as a secondary clause-level topic. Supyire allows
dative shift with only one verb, kan 'give', which may be characterized as
the prototypical three-participant verb, and whose equivalents in other lan-
guages are cross-linguistically the most likely to allow recipient direct ob-
jects. Most often when the recipient is made the direct object of kan the pa-
tient is suppressed altogether. It is, however, possible to include the patient
as an indirect object marked with the postposition na 'on, at': 2  (2) Mli a       ύ   kan bikf3 ηά.
      I   PERF him give pen at
      Ί have given him a pen.'","[422, 423]"
"  All relative clauses in Supyire, then, are restrictive. They serve to restrict
the reference or interpretation of the noun they modify (though see below on
488   Chapter 13: Relative clauses""afterthought"" relatives). In the most typical case, the speaker provides in-
formation in the relative clause which allows the addressee to uniquely iden-
tify the referent of the modified noun. In order to accomplish this function,
the information provided must be about the referent, and must be known to
or inferable by the addressee. Relative clauses thus contain a noun phrase
which is coreferential with the noun phrase being modified in the main
clause, and the information they contain is most often treated as presupposed
by speakers (cf. Givdn 1990, chapter 15).1 It is not surprising that such
clauses share basic characteristics with cleft focus constructions and the
commonest type of constituent questions, both of which consist of an initial
noun phrase followed by a clause containing presupposed information. Nei-
ther of these constructions derive historically from the present day relative
clause construction, however.
   Relative clauses in Supyire are unembedded. 2 The most typical variety,
with definite, referential heads, are preposed to the main clause. The relative
clause is terminated by the clause final relative marker k6, frequently voiced
to g6, and is typically followed by a short pause before the main clause. 3 (2) Yaag6      ka a       ύ   bd k6,    mu a  kürü   c6.
     thing.DEF it PERF him kill REL you PERF it(EMPH) know
     'The thing that killed him, you know it.'
      Freely: 'You know the thing that killed him'The etymology of k6 is not certain, but it is undoubtedly related to the loca-
tive question marker of the identical form k6 (see chapter 14, section
14.2.2.7). A connection between a locative question word or marker and the
relative clause marker is attested in a number of languages (see Givön
1990b, where Krio, modern Greek, southern colloquial German, and Bam-
bara are cited). Both the relative k6 and the interrogative k6 are quite likely
derived from the gender 2 singular demonstrative r)k6. The corresponding
relative marker in Cebaara is      which is probably derived from the gender
3 singular demonstrative tee. In Cebaara the marker is generally placed after
the verb rather than at the end of the relative clause. This placement and the
demonstrative etymology can be taken as indications that the markers had a
nominalizing function originally.
  As noted above, in the canonical relative clause construction there are two
coreferential noun phrases, one in the relative clause and one in the main
clause. The first of these we will call the ""relativized noun phrase"". It is in
some respects like the ""head"" noun phrase in a language like English, since
it comes first in the construction and is more fully specified. The noun
phrase in the following main clause, which is typically pronominalized, will
be labeled simply as the ""coreferential noun phrase"". The relativized noun
phrase is most frequently placed at the beginning of the relative clause, and
may or may not be additionally marked with an ordinary demonstrative or
                        13.1. Basic structure and function of relative clauses   489with a relative determiner. The coreferential noun phrase typically takes the
form of an emphatic pronoun (e.g. uru, pire, etc.; see section 13.3 below for
a discussion of the use of these pronouns), and occurs in the position it
would normally take in the clause (that is, it is most often not focused). The
following example (as well as the previous one) illustrates all these features.
In it the relativized noun phrase is the subject of the relative clause, and the
coreferential noun phrase is likewise the subject of the main clause: (3) Pücwdgi         u          jjye ηά mu f ke,
     girl.DEF(GlS) she(GlS) be with you with REL
     'The girl who is with you,
      uru            si ή-kwü.
      she(EMPH.GlS) FUT FP-die
      she will die.'
      Freely: 'The girl who is with you will die.'","[510, 511, 512]"
"  Although there are no requirements of coreference with the complements
of verbs in this group, as there are for the complements of manipulative and
modality verbs, there often is coreference in fact. The most common type of
coreference is between the subject of the main verb (the original speaker or
thinker) and some noun phrase in the complement clause. The reason that
this is common is of course because people like to talk about themselves.
Many African languages have special pronouns to use in indirect speech
complement clauses in order to show coreference with the main clause sub-
ject. 1 0 Supyire does not have a special set of pronouns for this purpose, but
instead uses the emphatic pronouns {uru, pJre, etc. see chapter 5, section
5.1.2.1.2, for the forms). These are used only for third person, there being no
special first or second person forms. The following examples illustrate this
special function of the emphatics:  (53) a. complement subject = main clause subject
           U a        jwo na uru           si         rj-kard.
           s/he PERF say that s/he(EMPH) FUT          FP-go
           'S/he said that s/he would go.'
        b. complement subject * main clause subject
           U ä        jwo na u       si    g-Jcard.
           s/he PERF say that s/he FUT FP-go
           'S/he said that s/he would go.'",[467]
"
1.7. A word on the examplesThe majority of examples used are taken from the text collection alluded to
in section 1.5 above. Occasionally elicited examples are used in the interests
of clarity. Glossing presents a few problems. The sex-based gender system
of English pronouns is a constant annoyance. The gender 1 pronouns of
Supyire are used for human beings of both sexes. In elicited examples the
gloss 's/he' is used for the gender 1 singular pronouns to indicate that a
person of either sex could be intended. In examples taken from texts, the
gloss used is simply 'he* or 'she' depending on the sex of the participant
referred to. It should always be born in mind, however, that the gloss adds
information which is not actually present in the Supyire.
  On the other hand, the glosses employed on occasion leave out
information, in the interests of avoiding irrelevant clutter. Thus in much of
the grammar, pronouns of various genders are glossed as 'it', without
6   Chapter I: Introduction
indicating the particular gender involved. In a similar way, definite noun
suffixes are simply labeled 'DEF', without indicating their gender. Anyone
interested in the precise gender of a pronoun or suffix will find the tables in
chapters 3 and 5 handy.
   Another case of underdifferentiation in glossing is the narrative conjunc-
tions kä and mä. These are usually glossed simply 'and', although they usu-
ally mean something like 'and then' and also include switch reference infor-
mation: kä indicates different subject, mä same subject as the preceding
clause.
   The differences in word order between English and Supyire have made the
free translations of multi-line examples awkward at times. This problem is
especially acute with relative clauses, which in Supyire are preposed to the
main clause rather than embedded. In chapter 13 accordingly many examples
have a more natural translation appended at the end labeled 'Freely... 1 . This
translation is closer to the functional equivalent in English, though of course
it is further from the Supyire form.

                                  Phonology
Supyire phonology is complex and interesting enough to merit a full-scale
study on its own. This chapter is intended to give the essentials only, in
order to make the remainder of the grammar intelligible. Some general
remarks about the phonology as a whole will be followed by sections on
consonants, vowels, and tones.
  The orthography used in the examples throughout this grammar is phone-
mic and follows the guidelines and rules laid down by the Direction Nation-
ale d Ά Iphab6tisation Fonctionelle et de Linguistique Appliqu6e, a sub-
ministry of the Ministry of Education of the Government of Mali. Most
letters have approximately the values which they have in the International
Phonetic Alphabet (IPA), including the ""special characters"" β (alveopalatal
nasal stop), η (velar nasal stop), ε (low-mid front unrounded vowel), and ο
(low-mid back rounded vowel). Exceptions to the IPA values are: use of y
for the palatal approximant [j] (rather than a high front rounded vowel); use
of j for the voiced alveopalatal affricate [d3] (rather than a palatal
approximant); use of c for the voiceless alveopalatal affricate [tf]; use of the
digraphs sh and zh for the alveopalatal sibilant fricatives [J] and [3]; use of h
for glottal stop [?]; use of a double vowel to indicate vowel length, e.g. aa
for [a:]; and use of n following a vowel to indicate nasalization, e.g. an for
[a].1 Tones are marked using accents over the vowels: ά is high tone and ä is
low tone. Mid tone is unmarked. Various tone combinations on a single
vowel are marked as follows: ä mid-low; ä high-low; ^mid-high; £ low-high.
The apostrophe (') is used to indicate tonal downstep (see section 2.3.5.1). In
this chapter the phonetic realization of a word is frequently given in phonetic
brackets.
  Metrical structure plays a role in every area of the phonology and
morphology. In general there is one stressed syllable per lexical root.
Affixes, clitics, and most other grammatical morphemes (e.g. pronouns,
tense-aspect auxiliaries) do not have stress, although they may combine with
each other to form phonological words complete with stress. In the majority
of lexical roots (including all verbs) the initial syllable is stressed, but there
are a number of roots with an unstressed initial syllable. Roots usually keep
their stress in compounds, so that a two-root compound will have two
stressed syllables. Stress is not written in the orthography.
  There are no closed syllables in Supyire. Syllables are basically CV or
CVV. A few grammatical words (e.g. the pronouns υ and uru) begin with a
V syllable. Only one kind of consonant cluster occurs: nasal + stop. Such a
cluster may occur initially as in (la) below, or medially as in (lb):
8     Chapter 2: Phonology
    (1) a. thpi     'hare*
        b. bdtjke 'the baboon'Two remarks are necessary. The initial nasal in (la) is not syllabic, even
though it has its own tone. There are syllabic nasals in Supyire, but they
arise through vowel elision as will be seen in section 2.2.2.4 below. The
much more common clusters under consideration are pronounced like prena-
salized stops. The second remark follows from the first. It might seem that
the initial syllable of (lb) above should be CVN, i.e. closed with the nasal.
However, when asked to pronounce such words very slowly, native speakers
invariably place the [η] with the following syllable rather than with the pre-
ceding one: bo-gke and not          borj-ke?","[28, 29, 30, 31]"

                               Introduction
1.1. The peopleThe Supyire language is spoken by the Supyire people. The noun süpyfrä, in
effect, has two meanings: 'the people' and 'the language spoken by the peo-
ple'. The word is used as a name in both senses in this grammar. The
Supyire live in southeastern Mali in the region of Sikasso (see map 1). By
tradition they came from the south, and this is probably historically accurate
since the main body of the Senufo language group, to which Supyire
belongs, is located in northern Cöte d'lvoire (see map 2).
  The Supyire are peasant farmers. They cultivate various kinds of cereals
and keep livestock. Traditional political organization did not go beyond the
village level. They have, however, been incorporated into various political
entities in the region. In the last 125 years they have successively been part
of the Jula kingdom of Sikasso, French West Africa, and finally the country
of Mali.
  The dialect described in this grammar is spoken in the region of Kampwo,
to the west of Sikasso and bordering the Bambara-speaking region of Gana
(not to be confused with the country of Ghana). The data was collected in
the village of Farakala, located 40 kilometers west of Sikasso on the main
road to the capital Bamako, and from neighboring villages, none more than
15 kilometers from Farakala.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"

15.1.11. The discourse-thematic function of adverbial clausesA number of recent studies have drawn attention to the use of various types
of adverbial clause to signal the thematic organizaion of the discourse in
which they occur (see in particular Haiman 1978, Thompson 1985, 1987,
Marchese 1987, Ramsay 1987). This is a large and varied subject which war-
rants further research.
  In a number of languages, and probably in most, some types of adverbial
clause have a discourse-thematic function far beyond merely providing ad-
verbial modification of their main clauses. In some languages, where there is
freedom to place the subordinate clause on either side of its main clause,
preposed adverbial clauses have been found to have a markedly different
discourse function from postposed ones. In general, preposed clauses have
both a linking and a demarcating function: they recapitulate or recall infor-
mation in the preceding thematic paragraph, while simultaneously indicating
the beginning of a new thematic paragraph (cf. Thompson and Longacre
1985:207f¥). For most adverbial clause types in Supyire, this freedom of
placement is not available. 'When' clauses, for example, must be preposed
to their main clause, while purpose clauses must be postposed.
  It is nevertheless not difficult to demonstrate that preposed adverbial time
clauses in sequentially ordered discourse function at the thematic level in a
way similar to preposed 'when' clauses in English. This is illustrated in the
following extract from a procedural discourse on how to construct a granary.
                                                                     15.1. Adverbial clauses    589Note how the content of each adverbial time clause (in form they are condi-
tional) provides a coherence 'hook' linking the clause to the information in
the previous section, as well as setting the stage for the following section.
This thematic organization is exactly like that reported for Godi6 in
Marchese 1987.","[611, 612]"

  The majority of constituent questions in Supyire are in the form of cleft fo-
cus constructions. The question word, or the noun phrase containing it, is
fronted to focus position at the head of the clause. The same case recover-
ability strategies are used as in clefts: a resumptive pronoun for subjects, a
gap for direct objects, and adpositional marking of the focused item for indi-
534     Chapter 14: Non-declarative speech actsrect objects (see chapter 12, section 12.1.1). The information which the
speaker and hearer share is placed in the presupposed clause following the
focused item. Following are examples illustrating a questioned subject (35a),
direct object (35b), and indirect objects (35c, d): (35) a. Jö   u      a            kü   bd ye?
         who s/he PERF            it   kill Q
         'Who killed it?'
         b. Jlähä mu mpyi    na     si   ή-kän ye?
            what you PAST PROG FUT FP-give Q

            'To whom did you sell it?'","[556, 557]"

10.2.1. PassiveIt is important to recall at the outset that passive clauses in Supyire are not
morphologically distinguished in any way from simple intransitive clauses
(see chapter 7, section 7.4.1). 4 They can only be differentiated from ordinary
(active or stative) intransitive clauses on the basis of their meaning. Like the
statives, passives have subjects with the semantic role of patient. They can
be differentiated from the statives and the active intransitives on the basis of
the verb: an intransitive clause with a patient subject and a normally transi-
tive verb must be passive.
  In order to give some substance to the ""normally"" of the last sentence, the
most commonly occurring transitive verbs in the corpus were tabulated. A
402     Chapter 10: Transitivity and voicetotal of 21 transitive verbs occur more than 20 times each in the corpus. 5
These are given in Table 35 together with the percentages of occurrences of
each verb in transitive, passive, and active intransitive clauses.","[424, 425]"
"
14.2.2. Constituent questionsConstituent (""information"", ""wh"") questions are different from yes/no ques-
tions in both form and function. Speakers typically use constituent questions
when they wish to know one bit of information which is missing in an oth-
                                                           14.2. Questions   533
erwise known proposition (cf. Giv<Sn 1990, chapter 18). The bit of desired
information is coded with a question word, for which there is no equivalent
in a yes/no question.
  The basic structure of constituent questions is described in the following
subsection. Subsequent sections give specific information about the various
types of question, classified according to the question word employed.","[555, 556]"
"This admittedly restricted marking of the presupposed part of the proposition
is also found in questions and relative clauses, and forms part of the marking
of negation in progressive clauses (see chapter 9, section 9.4.1.2).
  When word order is exploited for pragmatic purposes, its function of cod-
ing syntactic roles is disrupted. The cleft construction thus creates a ""case-
recoverability"" problem: how does the speaker let the addressee know what
the syntactic case role of the focused item is? With a focused direct object, a
simple gap is used. If the verb is transitive, the absence of a direct object be-
tween the tense-aspect auxiliary and the verb is a clue to the hearer that this
is where the focused item belongs. Note that when the direct object is re-
moved from its normal position, the intransitive prefix appears on the verb.  (4)   a. unfocused direct object
           Pi na        kuru          pirjke    pyi 'bogo'.
           they PROG this(EMPH) drum.DEF call bogo
           'They call this drum ' b o g o ' . '
        b. focused direct object
           Kuru           plyke    pi    pye na             0   m-pyi    'bogo'.
           this(EMPH) drum.DEF they be PROG                     IP-call bogo
           'It is this drum which they call ' b o g o ' . '  When the focused item is the subject, it is immediately followed by a
coreferential anaphoric pronoun. Without this pronoun, the focus construc-
tion would be morphologically indistinguishable from an ordinary clause,
since the subject normally comes first in such clauses. The strong stress on
the subject would of course provide an intonational clue, but this is evidently
not sufficient. The pronoun, which like ordinary subjects is unstressed, is an
unmistakable indication that the construction is marked for focus. 2 When the
focused item is a first or second person pronoun, the resumptive pronoun is
third person, gender 1. In the following examples, context has been included
where possible to get a feel for the nature of the focus involved.
470   Chapter 12: Focus and topic constructions (5) a. 'The monitor lizard said ""Of your two women, which do you like
        the best?"" He said ""I like them both."" Then the monitor lizard

        me live, the girl who is with you will die."" The man stood there.
        He didn't know what to do. Whenever he started to kill the

14.2.2.1. Basic structure of constituent questions  Constituent questions are doubly marked in Supyire. They contain question
words, which have no non-interrogative function (unlike the corresponding
words in languages like English or French, in which many of the question
words also function as relative pronouns), and they are marked with sentence
final interrogative particles. Three such markers are used. Most of the ques-
tion words are accompanied by the particle ye. Some speakers also occa-
sionally use bi for these question types.10 Locative questions take the final
marker k6 (usually voiced to g€).
  There are five simple question words in Kampwo Supyire, in addition to
the interrogative determiners, for which there are both ordinary and em-
phatic forms for each of the genders. Table 41 lists these question words.
Only the gender 1 singular interrogative determiners are included; for the
forms of the determiners in other genders see Tables 18 and 19 in chapter S.
'When' and 'why' are missing from the table because they are not simple
question words (see section 14.2.2.3 for 'why' and 14.2.2.6 for 'when').",[556]
"  When the relativized noun phrase is a first or second person pronoun, the
coreferential noun phrase is the same pronoun, as in (16) above. When the
relativized noun phrase is non-referential, the second person singular pro-
noun is sometimes used as a coreferent, in a manner reminiscent of the non-
referential use of 'you' in English. (The following example is also of interest
in that it has a topic noun phrase preceding the relative clause.) (26) Fäägä     ta-cyinge         cögdrji

          you HAB IP-pass villages three beside
          you pass three villages../  ""Grammatical"" gender and ""semantic"" gender sometimes do not coincide
in Supyire, as is common in languages with gender systems. Thus while gen-
der 1 can be characterized semantically as the ""human"" gender, there are a
few words in other genders which can be used to refer to human beings. The
gender 2 noun yaaga 'thing', for example, is sometimes used in a rather in-
formal way to refer to a person. In syntactically ""tight"" constructions, such
as within a noun phrase, agreement is governed entirely by grammatical
gender. In ""loose"" constructions, however, such as between clauses, there is
a tendancy to revert to a more semantically appropriate gender. Note in the
following example that the relative determiner agrees with its gender 2 head
noun, but the coreferential noun phrase in the main clause is gender 1, which
is more semantically appropriate: (27) Ml) könä ä        y)ri     bildre   e mä pä
      I    TOP PERFget.up slavery.DEF in and come
      'As for me, I left slavery and came

          Freely: 'The one who was paramount chief when I was freed from
          slavery and came here was K a f y a a /  Relative clauses in which the relativized noun phrase functions to encode
time frequently function as time adverbial clauses for the following main
clause, and in this case there is usually no coreferential noun phrase in the
main clause. (18) above is an example of this. Often the noun cyaga 'place'
is used instead of a time word:  (28)    U a      ylrd             jwü cyäge       j}k6-mii ) g6y

          my gall bladder arose.'
          Freely: 'When he said this, I got angry.'
                              13.4. Non-referential relativized noun phrases   505Time adverbial clauses with past time reference are historically derived from
such relative clauses by the omission of the relativized noun phrase as well.
See chapter 15, section 15.1.1.1 for a description.
  A final note on the coding of the coreferential noun phrase: although they
are not generally placed in focus position, there is certainly no prohibition
against this. Examples (12a), (16b), (19a) and (19b) above illustrate this. The
same discourse-pragmatic motivations which lead to focusing of ordinary
noun phrases are responsible for the focusing of the coreferential noun
phrase.","[526, 527, 528]"
"The third important thing to note about this relatively close level of concate-
nation is that a verb may be repeated in order to show duration:  (2) Kä   u ύ       tf-kärä    ä    sä     jiäara mä   paara.
      and he NARR IP-go SC go walk and walk
      'Then he went and walked and walked.'",[307]
"  The same counter-sequential meaning of the perfect is found in comple-
ments of the verb ta 'find'. Very often the subject of ta is the gender 3 sin-
gular emphatic pronoun lire, referring to the moment currently reached in
the narrative. This is the most commonly used device to indicate out of order
events in narratives. Following is an example: (75) Kä wüü u         mli s^bärji26 Iwd.
      and we    NARR my ticket.DEF take
      'Then we bought my ticket.

"
15.1.10. Purpose            clausesThere are four distinct clause types regularly used as purpose adverbial
clauses. The first is a simple subjunctive clause, as in the following example:
586     Chapter 15: Interclausal connections (90) Pi na        wylge     türü          sf          Iwoho ta.
      they PROG hole.DEF dig.IMPFV SUBJUNC water get
      'They are digging the hole in order to get water/  Such a purpose clause can only be postposed to its main clause. If the pur-
pose clause has the same subject as the main clause, its subject is omitted,
leaving the clause to begin with the subjunctive auxiliary, as in the above ex-
ample. The purpose clause can also have a different subject: (91)    Kä pi /          sümägi     wu     sapcyeetma ä,
         and they NARR grain.DEF pour bird.DEF           to
         'So they poured grain out for the bird (to delay it)

" (94) Pi na        wyige     ίύτύ         ni      Iwoho ta.
      they PROG hole.DEF dig.IMPFV PURP water get
      'They are digging the hole in order to get water.'",[610]
"  Most of the verbs which can take a subjunctive complement when they are
realis may be characterized as manipulative verbs of speech. Even pyi
'make, do', when used in this way, generally is taken to mean 'tell, order': (27) Kä pyärji        tiibff4     s)       d yydre...
      and child.DEF fathers.DEF NARR her call
      'Then the child's fathers called her...

       and .NARR Nteencwo make she SUBJUNC.IMPFV pack
       and told Nteencwo to pack.'",[457]
"
15.3.2. Switch   referenceWhat distinguishes Supyire from other African languages is the use of the
conjunctions kä and mi to signal switch reference. The development of
switch reference markers from conjunctions is well documented. Cases have
been reported in such widely diverse languages as Polish (see Frajzyngier
 1986), Green Hmong (see Li 1990), Pima and Papago (see Scancarelli
 1989), and Paez (see Gerdel and Slocum 1976).
  Switch reference systems of the Supyire sort, on the other hand, differ
from the type found in New Guinea, in which the clause with the finite verb
is placed at the end of the clause chain rather than at the beginning. Preced-
ing clauses in the chain are in a medial, less finite form. There is a cline of
finiteness, ranging from the most finite final verb form through the different
subject medial verb form, with the least finite form being the same subject
medial verb form. Supyire displays the same cline, although the finite clause
comes first rather than last in the chain.
  The Supyire switch reference system, like those reported in other lan-
guages, has the ability to ""skip"" over subordinate clauses. Thus a same sub-
ject clause may be used following a different subject subordinate clause, if
the preceding narrative clause has the same subject. Following are examples
of this:  (124)   a. direct quote complement of verb of speech

phrase can fill. When they occur as predicate nominals, and when in addition
they are indefinite, they resemble predicate adjectives in English and similar
languages. Two comments are in order, however. The first is that the normal
function of predicate adjectives in English, viz. the predication of a quality,
is ordinarily performed by simple verbal clauses with stative verbs in Supy-
228   Chapter 6: Noun phrasesire. The use of adjectives in predicate nominal position is relatively rare. The
other fact which must be noted is that frequently the adjective in predicate
nominal position has a deontic reading: it indicates what should or must be
done. 19 Following are some examples without such deontic meaning: (102)    a. rjkää Ii      Jä         ßye niß-cenne     mi.

14.2. Questions
Questions in Supyire, like those in most languages (cf. Sadock and Zwicky
1985: 178), can be broadly classified into two major types: yes/no questions
and constituent questions (Sadock and Zwicky call them ""information"" ques-
tions). The two types are distinguished in Supyire by the different interroga-
tive particles they require, and by the presence of question words in constitu-
ent questions versus their absence in yes/no questions. These two major
types of question are dealt with in the first two principal subsections of this
section.
  In addition to the major question types, there are a couple of minor types.
Alternative questions (see section 14.2.1.4) are similar to yes/no questions,
and are historically related to them. The 'What about ...' question type (see
section 14.2.4) is more like a constituent question in function, but lacks a
question word. Two further subsections deal with subjects related to ques-
tions: complex questions (section 14.2.3), and non-interrogative uses of
questions (section 14.2.5).
                                                              14.2. Questions   527
14.2.1. Yes/no    questionsYes/no questions are those which solicit a comment on the truth of the ques-
tioned proposition (cf. Sadock and Zwicky 1985: 179). The question is not
always ""open"", however, since the speaker typically expects one answer
more than the other (Givön 1990, chapter 18). Nor is the question equally
about all the information in the proposition. Instead the scope of the interro-
gation typically falls on what would be the focus of assertion in the corre-
sponding declarative. These issues are dealt with in separate subsections of
the present section, after an initial description of the form of yes/no ques-
tions. A fourth section describes the alternative question subtype.","[549, 550]"
"8.  While the vast majority of uses of the narrative auxiliary have past time
    reference, it is not strictly accurate to say this is part of its meaning,
    since a narrative marked with it may be embedded in a conditional.
9. There are two rivals for the honor: taha 'set down (for some purpose)'
    and tege 'help'. The first of these has the right consonants and vowels,
    but it is strong mid tone, whereas the grammaticalized verb is weak
    mid. The second has the right tone, and is also favored because for at
    least some speakers an alternate pronunciation of the grammaticalized
    verb is tegs. In fact, these two verbs are probably themselves related.
    Both Cebaara and Sucite have high tone verbs (recall that high is prob-
    ably the historical source of weak mid) with the vowel [ε] meaning
    'put' or 'place': Cebaara ίέ?έ 'put' (French mettrer, Mills 1987: 352),
    Sucite tixί (Garber 1987: 365). Significantly, the Sucite verb also
    means 'help'. In addition, Cebaara has a verb tägä 'believe', which,
    given the widespread use of a single verb to mean 'put down' and
    'believe' in the area (cf. Bambara da and Supyire yah a), must be re-
    lated. Sucite also has a mid tone verb ta?a 'put on the fire', which is
    one of the meanings of Supyire taha 'set down' (it also means 'follow',
    and 'repeat, recite'). How many proto-verbs there were, and how the
    meanings were divided up among them is unclear at present.
10. In at least one Senufo language, Karaboro, the cognate, k3 survives only
    as a benefactive postposition.
11. The to (from Bambara ton) is actually a cooperative association. Such
    associations usually have annual feasts, and the expression for
    'celebrate the feast of a cooperative society' is to tf/je, literally 'seat a
    cooperative association'.
12. Of a total of 71 adverbial     clauses in the corpus, 39 ( = 55%) have sa
    (N = 20) or pa (N = 19).
720    Notes: Chapter 9
Chapter 9: Aspect, tense, modality, and negation
1.    The only systematic exceptions are bare imperatives, ""zero"" subjunc-
      tives, reduced same subject clauses in consecutive constructions, and
      nominalizations.
2.    It should be noted that the distinction drawn by Dahl (198S) between
      morphological and periphrastic expression of ΤΑΜ categories is diffi-
      cult to maintain in Supyire. The auxiliaries seem to fall somewhere in
      between the two kinds of coding. They are used to express both those
      categories which are typically coded morphologically cross-linguisti-
      cally (e.g. past) and those that are typically coded periphrastically (e.g.
      progressive, perfect). There is no difference in complexity of coding be-
      tween these various options. The use of serial verbs, by contrast, falls
      clearly in the category of periphrasis.
3.     WZ/is one of about twenty verbs which do not have a marked imperfec-
      tive form. For other examples see chapter 4, section 4.2.5.
4.    The tonal difference between the base form lyi 'eat' and the imperfec-
      tive form lyi is neutralized following a definite noun, since the floating
      low tone from the noun docks onto the verb.
5.    If the sample of languages in Dahl (1985) is representative, this is a
      rather unusual extension of the function of the progressive. Dahl notes
      'PROG is quite infrequently extended to habitual meaning'. With the in-
      termediate step of repetitive found in Supyire, the extension does not
      seem unnatural, however. As noted in Givön (1984: 277) durative, re-
      petitive, and habitual all belong in the imperfective camp.
6.    Of a total of 613 examples of the progressive used with a verb (rather
      than with a copula, see below) found in non-procedural texts (the ΤΑΜ
      in such texts is invariably 'habitual*, though this is much more fre-
      quently marked with the habitual auxiliary mahn than with na) at least
      180 could plausibly be argued to have a habitual interpretation. This
      proportion (29%) indicates that the habitual meaning is a very important
      secondary function of the progressive.
7.    A proverb. The wild yam has a very long and tender tip (its 'nose')
      which is easily broken off when the tuber is dug up. The use of the
      auxiliary jiye in this example is due to its being a focus construction
      (see below in this section).
8.    In many languages the future is lumped with the imperfect. Givön
      (1984: 277) suggests that this is due to the inference that 'if an event
      has not yet occurred, its terminal boundary is not yet specified'. The
      progressive has not encroached much on the future in Supyire, but if the
      scenario presented here is correct, more expansion in that direction
      would not be unnatural. It should be pointed out that the progressive
      does co-occur with the future (see section 9.2.8.2 below).
                                                            Notes: Chapter 9    721
9.    This combination of the progressive with the sequential/narrative
      marker si/rfand the same subject conjunction mä is dealt with in section
      9.2.7.2 below.
10.   Länipii 'tax' is borrowed from French I'impot 'the tax'. Wähäti is bor-
      rowed from Bambara wakati 'time'.
11.   Scnufö 'Senufo' is borrowed from Bambara or French, and should not
      be taken as the source of this much-disputed word. In this example it is
      used as the equivalent of süpyir^'the people'.
12.   The sige shiinbii are an elf- or fairy-like people who inhabit the bush.
      They are very short (only about a meter tall), have long, straight, fair
      hair and light skin, and their feet are attached in the opposite direction
      to those of human beings. They inhabit trees and have considerable
      magic power.
13.   This example is taken from a folktale in which Monkey is the comman-
      dant, and Hare is his commis, or secretary. The violent incident alluded
      to occurred when Dog, enraged that Monkey had demanded taxes from
      him, decided to set the matter right. The secretary's long ears of course
      made a convenient handle with which to fling him about. Bird 'office'
      is of course borrowed from French bureau.
14.   Kirimasa 'warlord' is borrowed from Bambara kile 'war' and mäsa
      'king', ' c h i e f . The speaker is referring to the latter half of the nine-
      teenth century, when the Supyire were subjugated by Bambara-speaking
      peoples. Dipye 'world' is borrowed from Bambara diyen 'world'.
15.   Mäha [ma?a] is obviously cognate with the Cebaara past tense marker
      maa. Mills (1987) nowhere indicates that the latter can be used for ha-
      bitual aspect.
16.   A pwünpaarawa, literally a 'dog-walker', is a hunter who uses hunting
      dogs. A ntoonpcwoo 'termite pot' is a pot filled with leaves and twigs
      turned upside down over a termite nest. In the morning, when the ter-
      mites have filled the pot in their attempt to eat the leaves and twigs, the
      owner can empty ('pour') the termites into a basket and take them home
      to feed to his poultry.
17.   The event referred to took place in the childhood of the addressee, now
      an old man.
18.   The speaker is recounting the butchering of the last elephant to be seen
      in Kampwoo. The occasion was a festive one, and was accompanied by
      music played on the fikhn), a small harp-lute (both the word and the in-
      strument are borrowed from the Bambara). The players sat on a portion
      of skin taken from the elephant, in the middle of a circle of onlookers
      (fogo, borrowed from Bambara fogon, 'space surrounded by onlookers')
      and the bullets found in the meat as it was cut up were put in a pile be-
      side them. The unfortunate elephant had obviously been much shot at
      before it was finally killed.
722   Notes: Chapter 9
19. This is called the 'hodiernal' tense by some authors (cf. Dahl 1985: 125;
    Comrie 1986: 83).
20. There are several morphemes with this segmental form in Kampwo
    Supyire. The ones most likely to be confused with the future are the
    subjunctive auxiliary si and the narrative/sequential auxiliary si There
    are several ways in which these can be distinguished from the future si.
    Only the latter is accompanied by the future prefix. The subjunctive and
    the narrative are frequently reduced to rV or V, whereas the future is
    never so reduced. The subjunctive and the narrative accept a floating
    low tone from the left (i.e. from the subject) whereas the future never
    hosts a floating tone. The future si can occur in a negative clause,
    whereas the subjunctive si and the narrative never can (there is a sepa-
    rate negative subjunctive auxiliary kä). Finally, these three auxiliaries
    all combine with the progressive in distinct ways (see section 9.2.7.2).
21. This form is attested in some dialects of Cebaara and in Tagbana
    (Clamens 1952: 1425). The form used in standard Cebaara, ή, is re-
    duced through elision of the vowel rather than the consonant.
22. I have suggested elsewhere (Carlson 1989) that the dative postposition
    ά, from *mä also has the same etymology. Clamens (1952) was perhaps
    the first to make the connection between the perfect and the dative
    postposition in a Senufo language, noting that they seemed to be identi-
    cal in Tagbana. He however suggests the etymology maha 'touch'. The
    imperfectivity of ma, as well as its tone, is certainly a count against it,
    since a perfect auxiliary ought to derive from a perfective verb. How-
    ever, the history of the verb 'come' in Senufo is not at all clear. This is
    one of only two examples in Supyire in which the imperfective is de-
    rived through consonant mutation (the perfective form is pa) and the
    only one that displays the alternation of [p] with [m]. The imperfective
    ma may be suppletive rather than derived from the perfective. However,
    it should be pointed out that the perfective form in central Senufo is
    [pa], and that the proto-Senufo form was most likely *paN. The situ-
    ation is too complicated to resolve without further comparative data.
23. Cf. Dahl 1985: 125 (also Comrie 1986: 85), who points out that in some
    cases a perfect has developed into a recent (or ""earlier today"") past.
24. Note that this makes the Supyire perfect resemble zero marking in the
    Creole ΤΑΜ system, at least superficially. Compare Bickerton's (1981)
    characterization of the zero marking in Creole ΤΑΜ systems as past for
    events and present for states. His explanation for this is that these are
    the semantically unmarked time references in each case.
25. Comrie (1986: 78) argues that the pluperfect is ""radically different""
    from the perfect, and ""should not be given a uniform treatment"" with it.
    While there are differences, (Comrie lists a number ad loc.\ cf. also
    Dahl 1985: 144) this statement is rather too strong. In fact the pluper-
    fect usually is related morphologically to the perfect. This repeated
                                                          Notes: Chapter 9   111
      concurrence of form cannot be merely a coincidence, but must be due to
      a deep-seated similarity in meaning. In fact the ingredients noted in the
      preceding discussion, viz. perfectivity, current (or ""lingering""; Givön
      1984: 280) relevance, and anteriority are all characteristics which the
      pluperfect shares with the simple perfect.
26.   S6bi (frequently also pronounced s6mi), borrowed from Bambara
      sehen, means any piece of paper with writing on it, including books,
      letters, and permits. In the context here is indicates the ticket for a
      ""bush taxi"".
27.   Never/is borrowed from French ncufhcures.
28.   Fwdrdbä 'co-operative society' is borrowed from Bambara fdrdba,
      which Bailleul defines as 'bien appartenant h la communaut6'. Darashf
      'five francs 1 is borrowed from Bambara dalasi.
29.   As a main verb, ίέέ either takes a dative-experiencer subject with a pa-
      tient indirect object ( = the thing the experiencer is accustomed to), or
      the syntactic roles are reversed, with the patient as subject and the da-
      tive-experiencer as indirect object. The serial construction follows the
      first configuration in having the dative-experiencer as subject. See
      chapter 7, section 7.4.3.2 for examples.
30.   Comrie calls these tenses ""combinations of absolute tenses"". In Supyire
      they are not absolute, however, as the reference point can be in the past
      or future, as will appear below.
31.   The progressive marker here is a relic of the origin of the future auxil-
      iary as an imperfective verb.
32.   The low tone on sähä here is due to the spread of the floating low tone
      following the subject, not to the negative auxiliary.
33.   The term ""main line"" is used to denote independent clauses which en-
      code the events of the narrative in their proper chronological order. It
      thus excludes all clauses encoding background information, and all sub-
      ordinate clauses.
34.   In poetry the earlier form warf is attested.
35.   Comrie (1986: 26-28, 61, 103) also doubts that the so-called ""sequen-
      tial"" tenses actual code sequentiality. He claims that the sequentiality
      can in most if not all cases be attributed to an ""implicature"", and that it
      is not part of the meaning of the grammatical forms in question. There
      can be no rigid dividing line between ""implicature"" and ""meaning"",
      however, since in historical change yesterday's ""implicature"" often
      becomes today's ""meaning"". Certainly if the speaker regularly intends
      the hearer to draw a certain inference from a given grammatical form,
      and in fact counts on that inference being drawn (i.e. it becomes a
      ""conventional implicature""), the stage is set for the inference to become
      part of the ""meaning"" of the form. Since the narrative/sequential auxil-
      iary in Supyire can only be used under certain well-defined conditions,
      one of which is that the chronological sequence must be observed
724   Notes: Chapter 9    (events can overlap or occasionally be simultaneous, but not out of or-
    der), it seems clear that the speaker intends the hearer to understand this
    to be indicated by the use of the auxiliary.
36 See Carlson 1986 and chapter IS below for a description of the switch-
    reference system of Supyire.
37. It looks very much like the perfect marker ä (this would explain the low
    tone on the final vowel of AS/), but it is unclear how the meaning
    (sequential with middle strength thematic continuity) could be derived
    from a composition of the perfect with a non-finite form. It could be
    that the original meaning of the perfect (possibly 'come', as noted
    above) could have been at the origin of this construction.
38. The leaves referred to are dead leaves with which the yam mounds have
    been covered in order to keep in moisture till the yams sprout.
39. The subject refers to a very old man who was incapable of walking. He
    used to be brought outside and 'spread out' in the sun—the verb is the
    one used for spreading out grain or cotton to dry. Cängke is 'sunlight'
    or 'daylight', and is the common word for 'day' as well'.
40. The subject refers to a fish caught by the speaker. Supyire fishermen
    are as prone to exaggeration as fishermen elsewhere.
41. C6g6imanner, way, means' is borrowed from Bambara cogo, with the
    same meaning.
42. Occasionally one even hears [d] instead of [r] (or [s]). Since [r] is an
    allophone of /d/ in unstressed medial syllables, it is not surprising that
    some speakers, when for whatever reason they introduce a slight pause
    just after the future auxiliary, interpret the [r] that normally appears
    there as /d/.
43. To 'answer the yes' means to supply the interjections and murmers of
    assent at the end of each breath group during a monologue by another
    speaker. The speaker of this example is about to launch into a narrative,
    and wants to make sure that someone is designated to 'answer the yes'.
44. This is evidence that the original form of the auxiliary was ba.
45. Jinä is borrowed (via Bambara) from Arabic jiimiy. In the Supyire cos-
    mology it refers to tutelary spirits which inhabit streams.
46. The construction is rather similar in meaning to the French expression
     Void que...
47. Although the perfect auxiliary is written separately in this construction,
    for most speakers the vowel following the glottal stop is not in reality
    long (/nähä ä/ becomes [nä?ä]). Note that the low tone of the perfect
    auxiliary replaces the high on the final vowel of nähä.
48. Compare the similar construction with säJiä described in section 9.2.5
    above.
49. The development from 'create' to 'reputed' probably went through
    some such stage as 'imagine'. Compare the development of English fie-
                                                         Notes: Chapter 9   725
    tion from the past participle of the Latin verb fingere 'shape, fashion,
    feign'.
50. Buwara was the first inhabitant of the region including Kampwo, ac-
    cording to legend. This speaker believes, though he is not certain, that
    Buwara was a Samogo (a Mande-speaking people whose territory at
    present divides the Supyire from the central Senufo groups) who came
    from Kong, a city in northern C6te d'lvoire.
51. Ja is also used as a main verb in the common expression for 'thank
    you': Mu a jä. Literally this means 'You have overcome.'
52. Following a high tone, mä is pronounced a step lower, as if it were mid
    tone, due to downstep (see chapter 2, section 2.3.5.1). Since nothing fo-
    llows in the clause (and the tone register is generally reset during the
    pause following the m£), the terracing effect of the downstep is not felt.
    To avoid encumbering the orthography with apostrophes, therefore, the
    negative particle following a high tone is simply written as if it were
    mid, i.e. me. The same practice is followed for other high tone clause fi-
    nal particles such as the relative clause marker k6 and the interrogative
    marker be.
53. Coming at the edge of the clause as it does, this looks superficially like
    evidence for the analysis of negation as it is treated in propositional cal-
    culus, as an operator on a proposition. The placement of negative mark-
    ing at the periphery of a clause is extremely rare (see Dahl 1979), which
    Horn (1989) takes to be good evidence that such an analysis is mis-
    guided. The value of the Senufo ""evidence"" is of course considerably
    vitiated by the occurrence of negative marking in the auxiliary position
    in most tense-aspects, a placement that is cross-linguistically common.
54. Pyenga 'compound, home' has a mid-low tune, the final low of which
    floats and docks on the following negative marker.
55. Yatooro, literally 'things with legs', has the same mid-low tone tune as
    pyenga referred to in the previous note.
56. Thus in spite of its consistent clause final negative marking, Supyire
    also abides by the ""Neg First principle"" (Horn 1989: 449, quoting Jes-
    persen) to the effect that negative marking is placed first or near the
    beginning of the sentence in the interests of clearness. Without such
    early marking, of course, the hearer would be unaware that the current
    clause was negative until it was terminated.
57. Horn (1989: 190), picking up on a hint in Clark (1974), uses the term
    suppose rather than presuppose to label this ""entertainment"" of the af-
    firmative, which obviously does not qualify as presupposition in the
    strict sense. As Giv<Sn (1989) points out, the information must be as-
    sumed to be backgrounded in order for the negative to be pragmatically
    felicitous, and this same notion covers the other cases of the use of the
    combination pye na.
726    Notes: Chapter 1058. One such segmental negative auxiliary (J) appears in the speech of very
    old people in a very restricted environement (see below). Cebaara has a
    present tense negative auxiliary with low tone: d (Mills 1987).
59. The Wara is one of the three major masks of the Kampwo Supyire (the
    other two being the Komo and the Kono), and corresponds to the Nya of
    the Bambara. The sij6r6 is the annual ceremony in which the mask
    ""comes out"".
60. The cognate of this auxiliary in Sucite (yl) is apparently the common
    way of marking negation in the auxiliary position (Garber 1987: 36).
61. Siga 'doubt' is borrowed from from Bambara siga or sigi 'to doubt'.
62. Jäcyi'importance'         is borrowed from Bambara jati*to count, consider'.
63. Piteti ' m a y b e ' is borrowed from French peut-etre.
64. The etymology of the second part of the word is unknown. It may be
    related to -fyin 'white', but the tone is wrong.
65. This means that the clause must be recognizable as a relative clause on
    other grounds. The use of a relative pronoun is of course diagnostic, but
    these are used only in a minority of relative clauses. In the absence of a
    relative pronoun, the placement of a noun phrase in focus position at the
    head of the clause, coupled with the absence of the negative identifier
    which marks a negative cleft (see below), suffices to indicate a relative
    clause.
66. The copular auxiliary jiye in this example is required when the progres-
    sive occurs in a presuppositional clause, and is not the negative marker.
67. Karadanti is borrowed from French carte d'identity. The speaker is a
    student visiting the zoo in Bamako and wishing to claim the student dis-
    count on the entrance fee. A student identity card is required to obtain
    the discount, but the speaker has forgotten to bring his.
68. Since the copula ßye does not take any negative marking in auxiliary
    position, the assigning of the negation to the main clause in sentences
    like this must be by default: the complement clause is affirmative, con-
    sequently the negation must be located in the main clause.
69. It may seem odd to speak of obligation in connection with rain. This ex-
    ample, however, is taken from a discussion about rainmakers.
70. Jatigd is borrowed from Bambara jätigi 'host'. The proverb refers to the
    fact that in order to obtain a wife you must have a host in her village
    who will be your intermediary with her family.","[742, 743, 744, 745, 746, 747, 748, 749]"

                           Complement clauses
As in most languages, certain verbs in Supyire can take a clause as an argu-
ment in place of a noun phrase. These ""complement"" clauses can fill the role
of subject or object. The bulk of this chapter (sections 11.1 through 11.5) is
concerned with the latter type, for which the term ""complement clause"" will
be reserved. Section (11.6) will briefly examine sentential subjects. The final
section discusses the theoretical implications raised by the unusual comple-
ment structures of Supyire.","[442, 443, 444]"

  Supyire uses many connective phrases in addition to one word conjunc-
tions. A few are mentioned here simply as illustrations of this common way
of marking adverbial clauses. Ani bk me 'otherwise' derives from a condi-
tional clause meaning 'if it is not this'. ML· J) tä 'although' means literally
'and find it'. Lire e 'therefore', 'that's why' is literally 'in this'. Lire nk II
 wüüni mü / 'nevertheless', 'in spite of this' means literally 'this together
with its own'. Mugüßjwd 'like', is literally 'you would say' (cf. French on
dirait 'one would say'), βähä ηά ye 'because' is literally 'on/at what?'. A
variant of this is jiahä kürügöye 'through what?'. Nowadays in the speech of
young people one often hears pL·sk6 or pasig6 'because' (from French parce
que) substituted for the phrasal conjunction.
  All these connective phrases are placed at the beginning of the clause they
mark, which ordinarily follows the main clause.

Chapter 2: Phonology
1.  The tilde indicating nasalization will be written under rather than over
    the nasalized character in phonetic transcriptions in order to leave room
    for tone markings over the character.
2. Nasal + stop clusters are rare in Senufo languages. It appears that they
    are a relict in Supyire. In most of the other languages (e.g. Mamara,
    Cebaara) a voiceless stop was voiced following a nasal and the nasal
    was subsequently lost. In some cases this has led to a three-way contrast
    in stops: voiceless, simple voiced, and ""lenis"" voiced (see Prost 1964).
3. Since most loan words are borrowed from Bambara, and since voiced
    stops are more numerous in Bambara than voiceless ones, the addition
    of loan words raises the ratio of voiced to voiceless stops. For compari-
    son with the ratios given in the main body of the text, the figures are
    given here for roots beginning with stops including loans: b/p = 1.33;
    d/t = .28; j/c = .37 ; g/k = .05.
4. In fact, none of the palatals except /y/ can occur in a medial unstressed
    syllable.
5. Other Senufo languages have many /g/-initial words, but these mostly
    appear to be a reflex of proto *gk, which is preserved in Supyire.
6. Several complexities in the morphology are ignored here as irrelevant.
7. One of the three quartiers of the village of Farakala voices much less
    enthusiastically than the other two. In another of the quartiers there is
    one particular family which is known for its fast, slurred, speech, and it
    is here, I suspect, that the champion flapper should be sought.
8. Some speakers will occasionally use a glottal stop in these environ-
    ments.
9. The pronouns and conditional auxiliary are written separately in keep-
    ing with a general decision to write clitics separately in the orthography.
10. The rarity of /g/-initial words was noted above. This verb is borrowed
    from Bambara. It requires an indirect object.
11. There is some evidence from internal reconstruction that the process de-
    scribed here as elision was actually historically a multi-stepped process
    which involved first elision of an unstressed vowel, subsequent gemina-
    tion of the two consonants thus brought into contact, followed by de-
702    Notes: Chapter 2      gemination and compensatory lengthening. The scenario for a typical
      gender 4 noun like ta- 'land', would thus have been (ignoring tone) *ta-
      ra-re => * tarre => taare. Unfortunately the evidence for the middle step
      is only circumstancial. More will be said of this in section 2.1.5 below.
12.   The number of roots beginning with the various fricatives collected so
      far is: I ft = 86, plus 26 loans; /s/ = 117, plus 26 loans; /sh/ = 1 9 , plus
      5 loans; /v/ = 11, plus 1 loan; /z/ = 11, plus 1 loan; /zh/ = 5, with no
      loans. The ratio of voiced/voiceless is as follows: without loans: v/f =
      .12; z/s = .09; zh/sh = .26; with loans: v/f = .10; z/s = .08; zh/sh =
      .20.
13.   This is the typical Senufo scenario for all NC clusters, not just those
      with fricatives. As pointed out above, Supyire is atypical in that voice-
      less stops are ""protected"" following a nasal. It is similar to other
      Senufo languages in its treatment of fricatives, however.
14.   There are also two noun roots in which initial unstressed /d/ varies with
      /s/: dis0nq5! sis0nj}0' fly\ and dilzi / s)izi 'thread'.
15.   The variations in tone will be explained in section 2.3.
16.   In his short investigation of Supyire (he worked with an informant for
      one week), Weimers (1950: 495) did not appreciate the full extent of
      palatalization and labialization in the language. Because of their
      phonetic realization as affricates, he proposed the phonemes / p 7 and
      /bV, but noted they occured only before III and /u/. He analyzed palatal-
      ized consonants as clusters (Cy), but noted that /py/ and /by/ did not oc-
      cur before /i/. He did not note any labialization, but did record vowel
      clusters like /ua/ and /oa/ (p. 497). He did not point out that clusters like
      *ue or *io do not occur. On the whole, the distributional and phonetic
      facts are compelling to analyze these so-called vowel clusters as SR +
      V. Weimer's notation of /p'/ and /b'/ (seen in his transcription of the
      name of the language as Sup'ide) was modified by Ralph Herber to /pp/
      and /bb/ (explaining references in the literature to Suppire). The use of
      either of these conventions becomes unwieldy once it is realized that al-
      most any consonant may have SR, and that to be consistant one would
      have to write for example kya [kxa] 'chew' as kka and fwoo 'debt' as
      ffoo. In conformity with other orthographies in the area, the decision
      has been made to write all palatalization-like SR as [y], and all
      labialization-like SR as [w].
17. It is significant that the beginnings of this are also seen in Cebaara.
    Mills (1984: 144) states that ""no contrast of CRi:/Ci: or CRu:/Cu:
    [where R = secondary release, RC] occurs. The phonetic realization of
    Ci: is always [Cli:] with very slight palatalization. The phonetic reali-
    zation of labial consonant with u: is [C w u:] with slight labialization."" It
    seems that Supyire extended this process to other long vowels.
18. The Supyire use both a six-day and a seven-day week, which run con-
    currently. A particular day may be named for its place in the six-day
                                                           Notes: Chapter 2    703
      week, e.g. ky)) ' K y i i \ for its place in the seven-day week, e.g.
      tientähärä 'Tuesday', or with a compound of the two, e.g.
      ky tin tientähärä 'Kyii-Tuesday'. The date for certain events depends on
      the coincidence of particular days from the two weeks. For example, the
      annual sacrifice to the tutelary spirits of the village of Farakala must be
      celebrated on a Kyii-Tuesday.
19.   This alternation occurs in all the various forms of pronouns and deter-
      miners of gender 3 plural, e.g. ky)) or cyli 'some (indefinite pronoun)',
      i)kyι for ficyif these (demonstrative)'.
20.   Weimers (1950: 497) transcribed this sound as [kea] and says ""In the
      cluster /ea/, /e/ is a central vowel"". His informant came from the village
      of I)gu Kanha (Molasso), four kilometers distant from Farakala. At the
      present time the pronunciation of this sound is the same in the two vil-
      lages, viz. [kxa]. Weimers states (1950: 494) that his informant was
      good at pronouncing individual vowels very slowly, and it is possible
      that his attempt to pronounce [kx] very slowly may have given the im-
      pression that the [x] was a high central vowel.
21.   In section 2.2.1.3 below it is shown that following SR, for most roots /ε/
      may vary with /a/.
22.   This is the sole example before /u/.
23.   See note 20 above.
24.   What happens when an unstressed vowel comes to follow a stressed
      vowel within a word will be dealt with below.
25.   Both Weimers and Herber transcribe many of these words as Cua. If [a]
      were a variant of /a/, then palatalization and labialization would con-
      trast, but only before /a/, as in pairs such as pwa 'sweep* and pya
       'child'. Furthermore, labialization would never occur before /o/. When
      it is recognized that [a] is rather a variant of /o/, these anomalies vanish.
26.   This word is a recent borrowing from Bambara, which accounts for its
      failure to elide the first [1] even though it follows a stressed vowel.
27.   Note that if the vowel preceding /V (and often /n/) is stressed, the /V is
      elided. Thus in a CilV word one knows that the final V must carry the
       stress, since the /I/ remains. There are a very few words which may be
       stressed either on the initial or final syllable. The verb 'lie
      (prevaricate)' for example may be pronounced either fine [fne] or fini ['
      fini].
28.   The tone changes will be discussed below.
29.   These are not homophonous, i 'in' being strong mid tone and i 'with'
      weak mid. Due to the extensive tone rules which affect them, they al-
      most never have the same tone in a given context. They are both his-
      torically descended from forms with an initial consonant: *ni.
30.   Recall that an [1] or [n] which would otherwise elide is prevented from
      doing so by the addition of a vowel-initial clitic.
704   Notes: Chapter 231. This is pronounced (εεηηε by some people, obviously a newer pronun-
    ciation. A similar fate probably overtook many nasalized /1/s in the past.
32. Garber further suggests (personal communication) that the similarity of
    weak mid and high may be due to a common origin, viz. a proto-high
    tone which split into higher and lower variants. This hypothesis and
    much of the common synchronic behavior is nicely captured by Gar-
    ber' s proposal (following Clements 1981) of a two-tiered notation for
    tone, in which high and weak mid would share a common primary tier
    H, but be diffentiated on a secondary tier as h and 1. High could thus be
    written as Hh and weak mid as HI. In a similar fashion, strong mid and
    low would share the common primary tier L, and be differentiated on
    the secondary tier as h and 1. Strong mid would thus be written Lh and
    low as LI.
33. It may well be that a tonal affix could be reconstructed for the imper-
    fective (cf. Garber 1987: 51 for a similar problem in Sucite). It does not
    correlate with any of the segmental suffixes with which it co-occurs,
    however.
34. There are three exceptions to this generalization that I am aware of. All
    three were originally compounds, probably with an initial nominal ele-
    ment, but they are synchronically unanalyzable. They are: kakyanhala
    'surprise' (probably from a compound something like 'affair-surprise'),
    kalawwü 'annoy, pester* (possibly with the element wwü 'take o f f ) ,
    käänmücya 'check, watch' (with the element cya 'look for').
35. For this tune, then, all goes well if the initial tone linking convention
    begins at the right of the word and proceeds leftwards, as suggested by
    Garber (1987: 87) for Sucite. There are certain difficulties for this di-
    rection presented by the nouns, however.
36. Note that this loan provides nice evidence of the absence of contrast
    between the various types of SR. A back vowel may not follow palatali-
    zation, so speakers of Supyire simply changed the final back vowel of
    [a'vyg] to a front vowel [a'vy£]. A different strategy is employed to
    naturalize camion [ka'myg] 'truck', which becomes                 kamaßw5
    [kama'i{:§] through the insertion of an extra vowel.
37. Only one root of this sort with LMs tone has been found which has a
    chance of being monomorphemic. This tune is quite common in nomi-
    nalizations of Ms verbs which are derived by the addition of a low-tone
    nasal prefix. For example *zuu/o 'crouching' from suulo 'crouch'.
38. If the combination which are apparently impossible in two-tone tunes
    (MsMw, MwMs, MwH, and HMw) are excluded from the theoretically
    possible thirty-six three-tone tunes, only sixteen possible tunes are left.
    It should be noted that it is not possible to determine whether medial
    mid tones in a three-tone tune are Mw or Ms.
39. The final high tone is due to the addition of the diminutive suffix -rV.
                                                          Notes: Chapter 3   70540. Genitive constructions in which the possessor is indefinite are rather
    rare. Where such constructions might be expected, as when the posses-
    sor has generic, non-referential meaning, Supyire favors the use of com-
    pounds. For some examples of these, see below.
41. The L spreads to the Ms verb by a process discussed in section 2.3.3.2.
42. A one syllable Ms verb loses its Μ tone altogether and will thus trigger
    the downstep rule. Two or more syllable Ms verbs keep the Ms tone on
    their final vowel and so do not trigger downstep. A Mw verb loses its Μ
    tone altogether in favor of the spreading H, but recall that such a Η
    must come from the auxiliary (though it may pass through a simple pro-
    noun). If there is an indefinite noun direct object ending in Η tone, it
    will trigger the rule converting Mw verb to H, and downstep will be in-
    serted. In this case the contrast between Mw and Η verbs is neutralized.
43. It is interesting that Weimers (1950) consistently recorded MwL nouns
    as Η (the credit for recognizing them as ML goes to Ralph Herber).
    This may be due to the fact that the definite suffix is pronounced
    slightly lower than the initial Μ because of downdrift, and to the fact
    that the L is often pronounced very quickly and is thus difficult to per-
    ceive.","[724, 725, 726, 727, 728]"
"
9.3.5.    PurposeIn section 9.1.5 above the function of pa 'come' and sa 'go' as VI in serial
constructions to code inceptive meaning was described. An even more fre-
quent function of these verbs is to code purpose. Often the idea of motion
remains, so that the construction means 'come/go in order to V2':  (146)     a. Kä mii f       ηί-ρά
               and I    NARR IP-come
               'Then I came

               Herber money.DEF give him to
               (and) gave Herber's money to him.'
            b. Kä \νύύ ύ        sä paära känhe          e.
               and we   NARR go walk        town.DEF in
               'Then we went (and) walked in the town.'",[397]
"35. This verb also can mean 'move' in a sense apparently quite similar to
    kiinrji in the preceding list.
36. The person becoming accustomed or the thing becoming accustomed to
    is the subject, while the oblique (marked with na 'at, on') codes the
    thing becoming accustomed to or the person becoming accustomed, re-
    spectively.
37. Borrowed from Bambara tiki 'cut, cross, not have confidence in'.
38. Borrowed from Bambara yäfa 'forgive'.
39. This is the non-present copula (see section 7.3.1) with a dynamic sense.
    Both are derived from the transitive verb pyi 'do, make'. Note that the
    latter can also take a predicate nominal when used transitively (see sec-
    tion 7.4.4.5 below).
                                                             Notes: Chapter 7    717
40. This is the intransitive (one might argue, passive) use o f the verb si
    'engender, give birth'.
41. This is from a myth recounting the origin o f human beings. The first
    couple hatched from an egg brought down to earth by the Sky God Kile.
42. This is from a story telling how a dead mother sprouted as a tree to pun-
    ish her co-wife for mistreating her child.
43. This is the causative form of s6g6'burn (intransitive)'.
44. The patients involved may be as diverse as a pimple or a wet towel.
    This is also the verb normally used to denote milking.
45. The subject of this verb (in its transitive use) can be either male
    ('father') or female ( ' g i v e birth').
46. This is the causative of sinflie down'.
47. This is the 'plural* form o f l i h i 'let go, take o f f . Peeling something re-
    quires repeated actions of 'taking o f f . See chapter 4, section 4.4 for the
    formation of verb 'plurals'.
48. This verb has in addition two other senses: a) 'leave main path' and b)
    'give a new wife her own kitchen'.
49. This highly versatile verb has already been met in its intransitive sense
    o f 'believe'.
50. This verb must be related historically to the preceding one, and prob-
    ably also to the noun ηύ-gd 4 smell-G2S\ It is not much used, as far as I
    can tell, the principal way of encoding the concept 'smell' being with
    the expressions X nüge ta 'get X ' s smell' and X nüge bya 'drink X ' s
    smell'.
51. Borrowed from Bambara sdmi' warn'.
52. These forms are synonymous, and certainly related historically. Some
    people use one or the other, and some use both.
53. This is a transitive use of k e i g i 'turn'. Cf. English 'turn into'.
54. This verb also means 'get, obtain'.
55. The direct object is focused and thus moved to the front o f the clause in
    this example. The noun jink is borrowed from Bambara, which got it
    from Arabic. In Supyire it denotes the spirits which inhabit streams and
    sacred pools.
56. Note in this example that the noun mege is indefinite, indicating that it
    is starting to be incorporated into the verb. The new, compound verb
    will thus be    mege-pyi'name'.
57. The direct object is focused in this example.
58. This is borrowed from Bambara where its original and primary meaning
    is 'put down'. The Supyire verb yaha also has as its primary meaning
    'put down'. It is unclear whether the use o f yaha to mean 'believe' is a
    caique on Bambara da, or if da is tending to replace yaha because the
    latter has developed so many other senses (see the next list below).
718 Notes: Chapter 859. This is the ubiquitous verb pyi ' d o ' which has already been mentioned
    frequently in the preceding sections as having the senses 'become, be
    (non-present tense), call'.
60. With a complement clause, kanmeans 'give in order that...'.
61. With an indicative na complement, ßye means 'see (realize) that...',
    with a real is (H tone) complement, it means 'see someone/something
    (doing something)'.
62. This is borrowed from Bambara /n/zr/'think'.
63. Songo 'plan' can also be used as a verb of cognition meaning 'think.'
64. Cya 'try' is also used as a transitive verb meaning 'seek f o r ' .
65. This is not surprising in view of the fact that many of the adverbs are
    derived from nouns. They have shed any adpositional marking they may
    have had, and they no longer inflect as nouns, but many of them carry
    the vestiges of noun class morphology. See chapter 5, section 5.5.

10.2. D e t r a n s i t i v i z a t i o nAs shown in chapter 4 above, verbs in Supyire can be broadly categorized
into transitive and intransitive, according to whether they ordinarily take a
direct object or not. The use of the word ""ordinarily"" should alert the reader
to the fact that there are exceptions, and it is precisely with these exceptional
cases that this chapter is concerned. The exceptions are of two sorts: in-
transitive verbs which occur in transitive clauses, and transitive verbs which
occur in intransitive clauses. The latter form the topic of this section.
  There are two major types of detransitivization in Supyire. The first, the
passive, is accomplished through the suppression of the agent, for pragmatic
reasons. The remaining patient (or some other participant) is then made
subject. The other type of detransitivization may be called ""antipassive"" be-
cause it involves the suppression or ""demotion"" of the patient. It may in turn
be classified into two types. The first involves the simple suppression of the
patient/direct object of certain verbs. This suppression, like that of the agent
in the passive, is done mainly for pragmatic reasons. The second type of
""antipassive"" detransitivization is in contrast done mainly for semantic rea-
sons, and involves the ""demotion"" of the patient to an indirect object role.",[424]
"   Another possible motive for suppressing mention of the agent may be po-
liteness. Once during an interview with two old men, I asked one of them
how many years ago a certain event had occurred. He gave a wild estimate,
which the other man took exception to. The latter proceeded to explain just
what event I was seeking the date of, ending with the following sentence. He
evidently suppressed the mention of the agent in order to avoid mentioning
me directly:
406     Chapter 10: Transitivity and voice
 (6) Cire            ci    ργε na       ji-cää    sä.
     these(EMPH) they be PROG IP-seek.IMPFV EXCL
     'It is these (years) that are being sought.'","[428, 429]"
"  If an indirect object is present, it normally follows the predicate nominal,
but occasionally may precede it, as in the following example: (58) Äihpyi            yli cydebff   mäha m-pyi
      if.COUNTERFACT you.PL women.DEF HAB IP-be
      'If you women weren't
       ämunl mi, m)i mpyi na            si    m-pyi     mu ά pyä.
       thus     NEG I      PAST PROG FUT FP-become you to child
       like that, I would have become a child for you.'
262   Chapter 7: Simple clauses
7.4.4. Transitive   verbsIn this section we will examine those verbs which ordinarily take a direct
object. Before proceeding to a closer look at the various configurations of
semantic roles possible with this large group, a word should be said about
the intransitive use of these verbs. For the great majority, the intransitive has
passive meaning, the subject in this case coding the patient of change. This
passive use is described in section 10.2.1 of chapter 10. Besides the passive,
there are two other constructions which detransitivize transitive verbs. These
are the suppression of the patient of certain verbs verbs and the demotion of
the patient to an indirect object role with a few other verbs. Both of these
are relatively minor constructions in terms of the number of verbs they can
occur with. They are dealt with in sections 10.2.2 and 10.2.3 of chapter 10.","[284, 285]"
"Following is a similar example with the verb ρέτέ 'sell'. The ""antipassive""
form was said to me one day by a friend. The transitive counterpart was
elicited on the spot:  (17) a. transitive: total patient affected
           Mi) si      nä     sürnägi ρέτέ.

           I   FUT FP-sell my grain.DEF in

"
6.6. Reduplicated verb modifying phrases
A modifying phrase consisting of a reduplicated verb together with a geni-
tive noun possessor may precede a head noun. The whole noun phrase is
thus a type of nominalized clause. The head noun corresponds semantically
to either a nuclear (e.g. agent) or peripheral (e.g. instrument, circumstance)
participant of the finite clause. The possessor noun preceding the redupli-
cated verb corresponds in general to the absolutive argument of the verb,
                                   6.6. Reduplicated verb modifying phrases   231that is, the subject/agent of an intransitive verb, and the direct object/patient
of a transitive verb. The reduplicated verb itself behaves tonally as if it were
a noun rather than a verb, but it does not take a noun class suffix. Although
it is written separately in the orthography, it is perhaps better thought of as
forming a compound with the following (head) noun. Nothing may intervene
between the reduplicated verb and the head noun.
   In the following examples, the head noun represents an accompanying cir-
cumstance: the noise produced in the event. The verb is intransitive, and the
genitive noun consequently corresponds to the subject/agent. Note that a
time word may intervene between the genitive noun and the verb, as in
(110b):  (110)   a. Närjkäabff         fbfl·     mähärjä    έ

            ßyaha   mΏ nä de!

            too much for me!'","[253, 254]"

5.6. Tense, aspect, and modality auxiliaries
In common with other Senufo languages, Supyire has a class of auxiliaries
marking tense, aspect, and modality. These are placed following the subject,
and preceding the direct object if there is one. Most of them cannot be de-
scribed as auxiliary verbs, since they do not retain the ability to act as the
main verb in any clause. Most if not all of them are derived historically from
verbs, however. The most common auxiliaries are given in Table 23. For de-
scriptions of their function, and possibilities of combination, see chapter 9.
  As can be seen, most of the auxiliaries in Table 23 are very small, consist-
ing of one syllable only. Many of them in addition suffer varying degrees of
phonological erosion as they are cliticized onto the preceding subject noun
phrase.
  All five of the copulas (jiye 'be', mpyi 'be (Past)', sii 'be (Emphatic)',
nähä 'be here', and wä 'be there') are used as supplementary auxiliaries in
various constructions. The verbs pa 'come' and sa 'go' have also developed
quasi-auxiliary functions.

5.7. AdpositionsSupyire marks oblique cases by means of several postpositions and three
prepositions. These adpositions can be conveniently divided on the basis of
form into simple and complex. The simple adpositions occur alone. The
complex postpositions are composed of a denominal first part followed by
one of the simple postpositions.","[200, 201]"
" One final point should be noted before leaving the subject of verbal clefts.
Use of the cleft construction to focus the verb is not possible in Supyire, un-
                                                 12.1. Focus constructions   475like in a number of other West African languages (cf. Stahlke 1974, Givön
1990, chapter 16). Only nominal constituents and adverbs can be so focused.
When I attempted to elicit sentences with focus on the verb, I was given ex-
amples with the exclamatory particle di, which is widely used not only in
Senufo but also in the surrounding languages. Following is an example: (18)   U a        kärd de!
        s/he PERF go      EXCL
        'S/he has left! *This particle does not specifically code emphasis on the verb, however, but
rather on whatever item in the sentence is in the focus of assertion. Thus if a
locative adverbial phrase is added to the above example, the focus will be on
it rather than on the verb: (19)   U a        kärd Sukwoo na       de!
        s/he PERF go     Sikasso to     EXCL
        'S/he has gone to Sikasso !'","[497, 498]"
"While this evidence is not overwhelming (the same argument can be applied
to most extraposed sentential subjects in English), it does contribute to the
accumulating picture of Supyire complements as being only very loosely
subordinated if at all.
  What is the evidence on the other side? Is there anything which argues
against a simple paratactic analysis? The first point to note is that there are
elements in the complement clauses which mark them as less-than-independ-
ent. The na and high tone complementizers are such markers. While these
morphemes do not necessarily mark their clauses as complements, they do
mark them as dependent in some way. Similarly, the subjunctive is quite re-
stricted in its independent clause use. The required omission of an equi-sub-
ject in some complement and all purpose clauses is an indication of their
less-than-independent status as well.
  The most telling evidence against a simple paratactic analysis comes from
the placement of clause final markers. These include the relative clause
marker k6, question markers la, ye, be, and k6, and the negative markers mi
and ma. When clauses which require these markers are followed by a com-
plement clause, the marker is placed after the complement. Note the follow-
ing examples:  (99) a. relative clause (functioning as time clause)

           till woman COND him refuse
           till a woman refuses him.' (a proverb)  In conclusion, complement clauses in Supyire are neither fully embedded,
nor are they completely independent. They have instead a hybrid status. If
they originally arose through parataxis, as seems likely, they have since de-
veloped a number of characteristics which show that they have to varying
degrees become more closely integrated into the syntax of the main clause.

                                 Chapter 12
                     Focus and topic constructionsThe bulk of this chapter is concerned with two constructions, one coding
contrastive focus, the other a marked topic. In both constructions, one noun
phrase is placed at the beginning of the clause rather than in its ordinary
place. This placement in initial position can be attributed to a very general
principle whereby information which is less predictable and/or more impor-
tant tends to get mentioned first. This in turn is due to a very general cogni-
tive principle that more attention is typically accorded to information which
comes first. Speakers exploit this principle in order to make sure the appro-
priate amount of attention is paid to the various bits of information in a
communication (see Givön 1985, 1988, 1990).
  In addition to these two constructions, two other means of coding focus
and topic are dealt with in this chapter: the contrastive genitive construction,
and marking of topic by means of the particle kbtii.","[487, 488, 489, 490]"
