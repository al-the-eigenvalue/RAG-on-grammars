                  With the mitibam leaves he tied the spear to the roof. [Kwanding 094]Since the expression of an instrument involves a combination of predicates, the role of an
instrument will be further discussed in §4.5.2.
   The general clause formula gives the most common word order. However, other word
orders are possible. Hatam does allow (oblique) objects to be preposed, or time adverbials in
clause-final position. Adverbs are possible at various positions throughout the clause, except
between verb and direct object. These options will be shown when I discuss each clause
constituent in §4.4. But first the general structure of the noun phrase, with comments on its
constituents, will be presented in §4. 1 . Section 4.2 will illustrate non-verbal predications,
which are not covered by the general clause formula. Another construction that does not
correspond to the verbal clause involves impersonal predicates. This will be presented in §4.3.
A rather striking feature of Hatam is its prolific use of asyndetic verb sequences. Since this
phenomenon is pertinent to the issue of serial verb constructions, I will discuss various
combinations of predications and the scope of negation which they allow in some detail in
§4.5. Relative clauses with their possible head nouns are dealt with in §4.6. This chapter will
close with a presentation of clause combinations in §4 .7, according to the conjunctions as
given in §3 . 1 5 .",[95]

29   The construction with the Indonesian loan ma-bisa was corrected with the Hatam bit-bon 'follow-make',
     expressing 'capability'.
30   Whereas in (55) ni-ngkeg 'its-skin' is the object of cug, here ni-nnan 'its (shedded) skin' seems to be subject
     of this same verb. It could be that cug 'remove' has two valencies, like for example dahat 'break'.
     Alternatively, the object is pre-posed in this clause. Although Hatam is a rather strict (S)OV language, it is
     possible to have an OV order; cf. (40) and (45) above.

                        Inspection of that list after I have collected data on Hatam myself suggests that Loukotka's source was from
Reesink, G.P. A Grammar of Hatam, Irian Jaya, Indonesia.
                        a dialect other than the main one, Tinam. I have not been able to find a date for Loukotka's publication.

2    Ger P. Reesink1.2 Hatam and its linguistic neighbours    Hatam is spoken by approximately 1 6,000 people living in the Arfak mountains, south of
Manokwari in the Bird's Head area of Irian Jaya, Indonesia. According to Griffiths ( 1 994
and pers.comm.), the language comprises five dialects: Tinam, Miriei (or Moille, as in
Craven and De Fretes 1 98 7 ; Moile in Tim PSL Uncen 1 989), Adihup, Uran and Moi? Hans
Iwou (principal of the Primary School at Minyambou) claimed that Tinam and Adihup are
virtually the same, Moille and Uran (y.Iaran) are similar to each other, but clearly distinct
from Tinam, and Moi (also known as Mansim in Indonesian) is quite different. The latter
language variety, also called Moi Brai, was characterised as a mixture of Hatam and Biak,
spoken by a small group of people. Moi Brai turned out to be equivalent to Borai, apparently
a transcription of Brai with an epenthetic vowel. This language is still known by a few people
near the coast. It does seem to be related to Hatam, with some Biak-Numfor features as well.
See Reesink (forthcoming b). In Borai or Moi Brai one refers to the language by mor moi,
while mor pin is 'bahasa Nufor' = the 'Nufor language' and mor brer refers to 'Indonesian'.
In Hatam on the other hand, ni-hyet mor '3SG-voice mor' refers to 'Indonesian'. Apparently
the term mor, which meant 'language' to the Moi Brai, had the connotation 'foreign' to the
other Hatam groups, such as Miriei and Tinam.
    The origin of the name Hatam is not clear. Pouwer (1 958:40) suggests that the word has a
Numfor origin: atam 'thatch of pandanus leaves'. Possibly it is an outsider's interpretation of
ni-hyet tinam '3SG-speech tinam' as a native speaker of Tinam would refer to hislher
language. Tinam is the major dialect, in which the New Testament has been published (by
Lembaga Alkitab Indonesia in 1 99 3). It is easily understood and spoken by speakers of the
other dialects. A systematic dialect study has not been done, but it seems that the major
difference between Miriei and Tinam is a regular correspondence between lsi and /hI, as in
M iriei sab and Hatam hab for 'bird', sum and hum 'fire', and so on. It is the Tinam dialect
that is the object of this study. I have no further information on variation between the other
Hatam dialects. Neighbouring language groups are Sougb and Meyah. The Sougb are called
Tuig in Hatam, and the Meyah are called Sreu.
    Typologically, Sougb, Meyah and Hatam appear to be very similar to each other and to
other languages of the so-called West Papuan Phylum: SVO word order, verbal morphology
limited to subject prefixation, Noun-Adjective-Determiner in the NP, Genitive-Noun order in
possessive constructions, and the use of prepositions (see also Reesink 1 996). Lexically the
languages have very little in common, although a few items suggest a remote genetic
 relationship between Hatam and the East-Bird's Head family, which comprises Sougb and
the closely related languages Meyah and Moskona. See Reesink ( 1 998).
    All languages of the (eastern) Bird's Head have at least a few words of Austronesian
origin, presumably from Biak-Numfor, such as pas 'rice', sansun 'clothes' and wonggor
 'crocodile' . Hatam has borrowed extensively. How old those loans are is hard to say at the
 moment. Items such as pikor 'school', las 'day', pinak 'send' are probably quite recent, but
 others, such as mai 'loincloth' (Numfor mar) and hup 'highlands' (Numfor sup) could be
quite old. See Reesink ( 1 99 8). An assessment of the relationship between Hatam and Biak­
Numfor would need more information on what seems to be the 'missing link ', the nearly
 extinct language Borai.","[17, 18]"

14   In Griffith's dictionary nyen is glossed as 'repeatedly'. I have the impression it conveys something like
     'without purpose', like nating in Tok Pisin: 01 i wokabaut nating 'they are just walking around'. It seems to
     be present in hanyen 'anew' which co-occurs with bu 'again' in: noni kwei hanyen bu 'he come anew again'
     = 'he came/comes/will come again'.
4 Syntax4.0 Introduction   Hatam is a rather strict SVO language, with time adverbials normally preceding the
subject. A subject NP (where NP includes pronouns) is often not required, since the verbal
predicate is obligatorily marked for person/number of the subject. Oblique objects, such as
locative or directional adverbials, benefactive or purposive constituents, are expressed as
preposition phrases, following the direct object. However, in natural speech I have not found
instances of all the constituents within one clause. Thus, a general formula for the clause in
Hatam is:
             ± TimelModal ± S + Predicate ± 0 ± BEN ± LOCas in:   (4. 1 )     Mmo       di-cig      (lj-yai ni-de   hamboi arm
               perhaps   l SG-father 3SG-get 3SG-POS machete adorned
               bak nani.
               to  you
               Maybe my father will give his adorned machete to you.
   The predicate is the only obligatory constituent of the clause, with the proviso that in
isolation transitive verbs have to be accompanied by an object. Thus, minimal predications
are as in examples (4.2}-(4.4).
   (4.2)       A -kwei.
               2SG-come
               You come.","[93, 94]"

   The Pacific Linguistics logo was
designed by Ian Scales after one
small panel of a poro batuna from
Vella La vella, held i n the
Australian Museum (A8 S 1 7). This
is an artefact made from a plaque
of fossilised giant clam shell
(Tridacna sp .), carved into an
elaborate fretwork design. These
particular artefacts were made in
the western Solomon I slands,
probably between 1 00 and 200
years ago.
   The basic cover design is also by
Ian Scales. The motif was drawn by

          Acknowledgements    Research for this grammar was conducted in the framework of the Netherlands
Organization for Scientific Research (NWO) priority programme 'The Irian Jaya Studies: a
Programme for Interdisciplinary Research' (ISIR), financed by the Netherlands Foundation
for the Advancement of Tropical Research (WOTRO). The programme is carried out in
cooperation with LIPI (Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia, The Indonesian Institute of
Sciences).
    I would like to thank Dr Hasan Alwi, head of the Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan
Bahasa (National Centre for Language Development), for his willingness to be the sponsor of
the linguistic studies carried out under the auspices of ISIR.
    In order to study the Hatam language in the Bird's Head area of Irian Jaya I also needed
and readily obtained permission from the authorities in Jayapura, Irian Jaya, and more
specifically in the regency (Kabupaten) Manokwari. I thank the heads of Sospol (Direktorat
Jenderal Sosial Politik) and Bappeda (Badan Perencanaan Pembangunan Daerah) for
their permission.
    But with just the permission and support of the governmental authorities it is hard to study
a regional language such as Hatam. During my first visit to Manokwari, Rogier Gruys gave
me many useful suggestions about whom I should contact. So, before I even travelled to
Hatam territory, I visited the office of World Wide Fund for Nature, where various Hatam
speakers were employed. The director, Daud Womsiwor, arranged for me to meet with
Yohanes Wonggor and Marinus Mandacan, both from Mokwam. They taught me a few
useful expressions in Hatam, and supplied me with a letter in Hatam about regulations for the
nature reserve. Yohanes read it on tape and gave me the meaning in Indonesian.
    In Minyambou I was welcomed by the missionaries of The Evangelical Alliance Mission,
Dick and Char Griffiths and Walter and Dianne Kennedy. My thanks are due to them for
their hospitality and their help. The TEAM director in Manokwari, Elmer Lorenz, graciously
allowed me to use the organization's address and infrastructure to keep in contact with people
in my home country.
   There is no way to learn a language without native speakers willing to teach. Many Hatam
people have been very friendly and helpful. They were willing to tell stories, which I recorded
and transcribed, or just provided words or sentences which I needed in order to make progress
with my analysis. Thanks are due to: andigpoi Tuantiei Dowansiba, and Yoas Wonggor,
Yoas Iwou, Yairus Dowansiba, Erens Morum, Isak Mandacan, Esap Iwou. In particular, the
texts from Tuantiei were not always easy to understand. Hans Iwou, principal of the primary
school in Minyambou, was a patient and astute teacher. He not only helped me understand
xii   Acknowledgementsthese difficult texts, but also was able to answer my many questions regarding morphological
and syntactic complexities. When he was not at Minyambou during my second visit in 1 995,
I found his cousins Yakonias Iwou and Yoas Iwou willing to help me with my questions. But
Hans Iwou, living then at Maruni, could again answer some remaining questions, when I
returned from Minyambou to Manokwari in December 1 995.
   Finally, I want to express my thanks to two anonymous referees and Bert Voorhoeve for
commenting on a first draft. In particular, Bert had gone through the manuscript with a fine­
tooth comb, and made many valuable suggestions. I want to thank Jelle Miedema, Dianne
van Oosterhout and Leontine Visser for comments on an earlier version of the
anthropological notes in the Introduction. I have benefited from comments by Harry van der
Hulst and Ian Maddieson on the phonology chapter. Cecilia Ode has helped me with the
measurements and printing the spectograms. None of these people are, of course, responsible
for the flaws that remain.

     If my semantic identification is correct, it is quite possible that ser may be used as a verb meaning 'to
     remove something out of something'. If kep could also be inflected, as possibly in K wanding ( 1 7) in the
     Appendix, these two adjuncts may well be of verbal origin in serial verb-like constructions; compare §4.S.
13
     I have only one example of kep following a noun, but this may be an idiomatic expression:
           Di-yok di-tingou kep               ni-hyet.
            I SO-put I SO-ear       keep.onto 3S0-word
           I listen carefully to his words.
     See further Anggos (3) and (23) in the Appendix for examples with kep following the object of a transitive
     verb.
                                                                               Morphology       75               (b) *di-ttei biei   kep   (3. 1 87) (a) Di-ttei      ser         biei.
                 1 SG-carry keep.out wood
                 I carry (something) to the exclusion of wood.               (b) Di-ttei    biei     ser.
                   1 SG-carry wood keep.out
                   I carry wood to the exclusion of something else.
    In elicited material as in example (3 . 1 86) kep is allowed only directly following the verb,
meaning 'keep on carrying'. Thus (3 . 1 86b) is not acceptable. Ser can either precede or follow
the object. The order indicates a difference in the affectedness of the object. For example, in
elicitation (3 . 1 8 8a) was rejected by one informant and immediately rephrased by another as
(3. 1 8 8b), suggesting that one would not take something else on the back to the exclusion of a
child.
   (3. 1 8 8) (a) D-usap      ser       munggwom.
                  1 SG-carry keep.out child
                  I carry (something) on the back to exclusion of the child.               (b) D-usap        munggwom       ser.

   It should be clear from this short description that a number of questions remain. For
example, what exactly are the factors that determine differences such as between (2.73) and
(2.74)? Other topics which need further research are the geminates. At least for the bilabial
                                                                            Phonology       39and alveolar nasals and for voiceless stops of three points of articulation enough evidence for
geminates has been given. Possibly there are also geminates for the palatal stop and the
liquid. Whether geminates contrast in voice, as the orthography suggests, remains a question.
   Regarding the voiced-voiceless opposition, my tentative conclusion is that this holds only
for the onset of stressed syllables.
   Possibly a basic template for the prosodic form of lexical items in Hatam could account
for syllabic nasals, vowel or consonant status of VV(V) sequences, and occurrence
restrictions of geminates and certain vowels. But that would require a more theoretical
treatment than I considered desirable for this descriptive study.
   I hope to have at least indicated that Hatam is characterised by a clear iambic metre which
has full clauses or utterances as its domain, and not some kind of limited word stress.
3 Morphology
3.0 Introduction   This chapter gives the word classes that appear necessary for a description of Hatam. This
language, like the languages that are claimed to constitute the West-Papuan Phylum, has a
rather limited morphology. Inalienable nouns and verbs are prefixed to index person-number
of possessor and subject. To facilitate the treatment of nouns and verbs, I will first discuss
the personal pronouns. There are a number of clitics which apply either to lexical items or to
clausal constituents. These will be presented before the other word classes are discussed. The
way some of the clitics operate on different word classes can then be described in the
appropriate sections. This chapter then, will provide all the 'building blocks' which are
needed to account for the syntactic structures to be discussed in Chapter 4. In general I will
use the established orthography. At times, when necessary, phonetic realisations will be
specified.","[54, 55, 56]"

    The order Genitive-Noun was already used by Van der Veen ( 1 905:95) as a diagnostic feature of Non­
    Austronesian languages of North-Halmahera. See also Reesink ( 1 996) for a comparison of the Bird's Head
    languages in general with adjacent Austronesian languages.
82 . Ger P. Reesink4.1.2 Adjectives   Adjectives always follow the noun in an NP, when they function as attributives. As shown
in §3 .5, they contrast with verbs in this respect. In attributive position adjectives may occur in
three different shapes: (i) as a bare adjective (example 4. 1 5); (ii) with the relativiser di- (see
§3.2.5) as in (4. 1 6); and (iii) with the 3 SG.POS prefix ni-, as in (4. 1 7). The difference
between the morphological shapes of the attributive adjective is reflected in the free
translations.
   (4. 1 5)       wou     cun    di-ma
                  snake short REL-that
                  that short snake   (4. 1 6)       wou di-cun           di-ma
                  snake REL-short REL-that
                  that snake which is short   (4. 1 7)       wou ni-cun            di-ma
                  snake 3SG-short REL-that
                  that short one of a snake
    In other words, the relative marker /dV-/ is employed to single out one individual from a
set of possible referents by a particular feature, expressed by the adjective. When the
adjective is marked with the third person singular prefix , it seems to indicate a more
permanent quality. The expression in (4. 1 7) would then refer to a snake that is inherently
short. Whether this is the correct interpretation is not clear. Thus, with respect to (4. 1 8a) and
(4. 1 8b) informants would say that (a) refers to a knife that is curved, while the (b) variant
would refer to a sickle which is bent even more. This could mean a temporary state, or a
permanent one of such a bent sickle. In other words, more data would be needed to ascertain
whether the semantic effect of 3SG.POS prefix is indeed a permanent quality. I have no
evidence to answer the question whether plural prefixes are possible in this construction.
   (4. 1 8) (a)   Singau koi        di-ni       ngwam.
                  knife    curved REL-this blunt
                  This curved knife (= sickle) is blunt.              (b) Singau ni-koi          di-ma        ngwam.
                  knife   3SG-curved REL-that         blunt
                  That curved knife is blunt.","[97, 98]"
"
4. 6.5 RC with HN as possessor    When a possessor is relativised, the N(P) referring to the possessor is fronted and the RC
is introduced by die-no). The possessive pronoun (4 . 1 87) or, in the case of inalienables, the
prefix (4. 1 88), remains in the normal position in the clause.
   (4. 1 87)    Tungwatu     di   hum        0-yem   i-de           ig
                people       [REL fire       3SG-eat 3PL-POS        house]RC               pima i-bong       bit   da ei        dit-de     ig-bei.
               that   3PL-sleep with I      LOC 1 SG-POS house-under
               The people whose house was burned slept with me in my house.
   In general, the word order in the RC is basically the same as in a main declarative clause.
The main participants obey the order Subject-Predicate-Direct Object-Oblique Object.
Whichever constituent is relativised on is fronted and the RC is introduced by a relativiser.
Temporal adverbials, which in a main declarative clause normally precede the clause nucleus,
are not permitted in their canonical position in a RC. Thus, (4. 1 88b) is unacceptable.
   (4. 1 88) (a) Pinai    di      ni-t-nem           mai           annani
                 man      [REL    3SG-POS-wife       3SG-die       yesterdaY]RC               dip-mang       rio

               man         REL    3SG-wife     yesterday    die     that
4.7 Clause combinations4. 7. 0 Introduction   In §4 .S , I discussed combinations of predicates. Most of those constructions can be
considered to form complex predicates or clauses. No natural discourse can do without
combining clauses, which generally is effected by conjunctions. Traditionally, the dichotomy
of coordination versus subordination is used, but it is not always clear which criteria are
1 20      Ger P. Reesinkdistinctive. The morphological material used to express various semantic relations between
clauses indicates that this is not a clear dichotomy in Hatam. This section is built on the
conjunctive material of Hatam itself (see §3 . 1 5), which suggests a division between
i) conjunctions used for sequencing events, ii) contrastive conjunctions and iii) conjunctions
which signal more specific semantic relations, such as cause, purpose, condition. The first
two categories roughly correspond to what traditionally is called coordination, while the third
reminds us of adverbial clauses, which are more subordinated.
                                                                                 ,
With regard to the conjunctions ba 'and', lene 'and then', and api 'thereupon 25, one could
claim an increasing scale of sequentiality. Since speakers are not bound by absolute values on
such a scale, there are contexts in which these conjunctions are interchangeable. As an
introductory illustration, consider all three of them in (1 89).     (4. 1 89) (a) Lene ni-huk         kikau          lene
                   then  l EXC-chase continually      then
                   Then we continued hunting and then              (b) di-sut       gam bu            pilei     bu.
                  I SG-friend one      again     shoot     again
                  a friend of mine shot again (i.e. the narrator had had his first shot).              (c) Nora mai        big-yo lene     ni-huk         kikau.
                  but      die    not-yet then     l EXC-chase continually
                  But it (the deer) was not dead yet and we continued hunting.              (d) Api    di-sut       gam bu          pilei bu,
                  then   I SG-friend one      again   shoot again
                  And then another friend shot again,              (e) ba    ni-bou        ningai ni-pilei           ug     e             api      maio
                  and l EXC-head three          l EXC-shoot go         Q             then     die
                  and the three of us had shot first and then it died.              (f) Mai lene ni-bam              rusa pima ba           ni-digo.
                  die     then 1 EXC-roast deer that         and      1 EXC-cut.up
                  It died and then we roasted the deer and we cut it up. [W onggor 1 :040-04 1 ]
   The more neutral ba, which is mainly used for same subject (or topic) sequences (4 . 1 89f),
conveys something like 'in addition (I want to say)' in (4 . 1 8ge) and signals an immediate
sequence of events (see §4.7 . 1 . 1 ).
   The most frequent conjunction to start a new sentence is lene (4. 1 89a), which is neutral to
the distinction between same and different subject . Thus, it is not claimed that Hatam
employs a switch-reference system as do many Papuan languages of the Trans-New Guinea

4.4.3 Object   As stated in §3 .4.2, transitive verbs require an object if it is not recoverable from the
context. This statement is based upon the informant's judgement that a sentence like 'At that
time we hadn't eaten yet' would require an explicit object in Hatam: ni-yem njinta big-yo
'we-eat food not-yet'. At the moment I cannot formulate a rule which specifies when an
object has to be provided or when it can be left out. In natural discourse, once an item has
been introduced, it does not happen too often that the referent cannot be recovered, so
transitive predicates without an explicit object are quite frequent. Thus, once the known
referent is referred to by an explicit NP binggas dima in example (4.5 2), in the subsequent
clauses the object is zero:

     Since third person singular lacks a subject prefix, the various tests and their interpretations are vacuous.
     Examples from the natural texts involving third person singular need to be confirmed for other person
     categories.
98       Ger P. Reesink   Such sequences are all necessarily same-subject, in contrast with similar sequences
interrupted by ba 'and' or lene 'then' (see §4.7. 1 ), which may have either same or different
subjects. When explicit conjunctions are employed it is clear that the sequence involves
coordination of clauses. The same observation holds for sequences interrupted by a pause, as
in example (4.97). But the question is, what is the status of sequences without connectives?
Are they asyndetically coordinated clauses? Does Hatam require an analysis positing a
special class of serial verb constructions? What happens to verbal prefixation in close verbal
sequences? What syntactic restrictions are placed on various sequences? In this preliminary
descriptive work I refrain from theoretical commitments with regard to the issue of serial
verb constructions. I have tried to gather data that seems to be relevant to the matter, and will
present that without too much interpretation.
   In order to at least partly answer these questions I will discuss morphological and syntactic
features of the following categories: (i) Directional verb sequences, (ii) Instrumental verb
sequences, (iii) Purposive verb sequences, (iv) Perception verbs + complements, and (v)
General juxtaposition. These sections are then followed by a discussion of the scope of
negation.","[113, 114]"
"For alternative conjunction, the Indonesian loan word (a)tau 'or' is used.
   Clausal conjunctions can be distinguished as sequencing, contrastive and adverbial. Some
are simple, most are complex conjunctions. Their meaning along with their syntactic
behaviour is discussed in §4.7. Here, I will give a list with a brief characterisation.
(i)       Sequencing conjunctions are:
          ba 'and', which can be phonetically weakened to [bg]. It is then homophonous to the
          weakened variant of bak 'to'. Thus, the purposive clitic bi (see §3 .2.6) may well be
          related to ba, rather than to bak. The matter is more complicated. Just as the third
          person pronouns no and yo have allomorphs with a final fKI, nok and yok, likewise bak
          and ba may be alternative realisations, with divergent functions: the former as
          preposition, the second as conjunction.
          lene '(and) then', which is definitely derived from the preposition leu 'from' and the
          topic marker ne, since some speakers still alternate between the two phonetic
          realisations.
          api 'and then, consequently', which conveys a somewhat stronger sense of sequence
          than lene. It is found with third person singular pronoun, apino 'then' or preceded by
          the preposition leu 'from' (as in leu api 'after that') or preceded by ug e 'go Q',
          expressing that the first conjunct i s finished, as in Anggos (8) and Dowansiba (29) in
          the Appendix.
(ii)       Contrastive conjunctions are:
           10 'but, and';
           noro 'but', probably a compound of no '3SG' and 10.
(iii)     Adverbial conjunctions make use of a preposition or a nominaliser:
          leu 'from' signals a reason or causal relationship, sometimes in combination with 0
          'inclusive disjunction ': leuo;
          leubinhyepo 'in order that' is probably made up of leu 'from' + bi 'INS' + ni-hyet '3SG­
          word' + po 'Anaphoric relativiser' . It is often shortened to lenhyepo, or nhyepo;
          mem gima is also found with the meaning 'in order that'. It is transparently 'for NOM­
          that' ;
          gi, the nominalising clitic (see §3.2.4) by itself or compounded with n o '3SG' = gino
          means 'if' or 'when'. That is, it signals a conditional protasis or temporal contingency.
(iv)       Some other complex conjunctions convey a meaning like 'therefore', 'so then'. They
           are:
          gi-ma-ri-ne or gi-ma-ri-no 'NOM-that-GIV-TOP/3SG'; and
          nok lene '3SG and then', which is phonetically realised as [nogrene].

adjectives, verbs, and adverbs, the numeral gom 'one', and the temporal noun (or adverb)
njap 'day(light)'. The semantic effect is duration for verbs, as in example (3 . 1 92), and
'diversity' in other instances, as in (3 . 1 9 3). Quite often, reduplicated verbs have the adverb
nyen 'without purpose' 14, as in (3 . 1 92) and (3 . 1 94).

"4. 6. 1 Relative clause with HN as subject   When the HN is subject of the RC, there is no clear fronting involved, since subject is

     The anaphoric relative marker po also functions in the phrasal conjunction leu binhyepo 'so that; in order
     that', which I analyse as leu bi-ni-hyel-po 'from INS-3SG-talk-ANA'.
22   Recall that the phonological alternation Ii > si is triggered only by a 'hidden' velar stop after a high vowel.
     Thus, a plain high front vowel as in the near demonstrative ni is never followed by si (or su 'already' or suI
     'along with' for that matter).

   The final IK/ of IngwaK/ 'empty' in example (2.6) is unreleased, preceding a morpheme­
initial stop, and the final /KI of l-ngwaK/ 'forehead' in (2.7) is a voiced velar stop, followed
by a schwa. This schwa could be a transitional element, helping to define a contrast between
final voiced versus voiceless stops, or to shape the preferred rhythmic pattern, but I rather

the different realisations are due to the phonetic environment, rather than the inherent
phonological shape.
   As far as I know, there are no possible minimal pairs within the word class nouns. Similar
phonetic realisation of nouns such as bed-a 'moon-CIT' or ngwag-a 'forehead-CIT' and
words of other categories, such as the verb bet 'to wait' or adjective ngwak 'empty' never
cause misunderstanding. Only within the class of verbs have I found minimal pairs suggesting
a contrast between voiced and voiceless velar stops in final position, but these are restricted
to verbs with the vowel lui, as in huk 'to chase, hunt' versus hug 'to pour', cuk 'to order'
                         ,
versus cug 'to threaten .6
   There does seem to be a phonological contrast in voicing between velar stops in word-final
position, revealing itself in phonetic realisations. This is limited, however, to environments
following high vowels. Consider the following items as given in isolation:
    (2.8)          !hukl          [hukh]; [huk>]                 to chase, hunt

   Words with final lkl or Ig! can both be realised with unreleased voiceless stops. The items
with final Ig! are also (and mainly) realised without a stop in isolation. They end in just a
vowel or an unreleased approximant following lui or a light palatal friction following Iii. The
(palato-)velar consonant does betray itself in the environment of a following consonant. For
example, preceding /hi, there is a contrast between !hukl 'hunt' and Itug! 'pound', as in (2.9).
The voiceless IkI is phonetically realised, the voiced Ig! is not.

munggwom-nya '2SG-POS child-PL' is explained as direct address to the hearer, while
munggwom a-de-nya would be used when the children are no longer present. Such an
explanation is hardly relevant to the difference between (4. 1 4a) and (4. 1 4b). My conclusion
is that the postnominal possessives stand in an appositional relation to the possessed noun.
The prenominal position is by far the more frequent one in my data.",[97]

and their social organisation in different groups (or families) and land rights.
    Various sources suggest that the Hatam trace their origin to somewhere near the
headwaters of the Wariori river (rim PSL Uncen 1 989:7; Pouwer 1 95 8 :5 9), which in Hatam
is Udop. Perhaps this area was just an intermediate station during their travel from their
original homeland further south-west, where the Rawara and Timoforo rivers join into the
Sebjar (Pans 1 960:25, 4 1 ). According to the oral tradition, near the headwaters of the
Wariori river is a place called Sen Mimbran (sen 'sungai' = river; mimbran 'alang-alang' =
'tall, coarse grass', according to the folk etymology given in Uncen 1 989 :5), where a short
snake lived in a cave, looking after a dog, Rinyap. Although the origin story of the Iwou
family which I obtained is quite short and leaves a number of events unexplained, it does
agree with information given in the Uncen report and the accounts in both Pouwer and Pans.
A number of Hatam families trace their descent to the short snake, for example the Iwou
(wou(k) = 'snake') and/or this dog.
   Descendants of the earliest ancestors, identified by name of different families, like Iwou,
Ayok, Mandacan, etc., spread out from the headwaters of the Wariori to the Anggi lakes,
and further north-west throughout the Arfak mountains and to the coast. The latter are
equated with the Moile, divided over a number of families, such as the Wonggor.
   These familles are referred to by the Hatam term pung, in Griffiths ( 1 994:66) glossed as
'ancestor, lineage', in the Uncen report and by my informants unsystematically rendered as
Jam, marga , keluarga, keret, which are all roughly translatable as 'family', or suku 'tribe'.
Pouwer ( 1 958 :37) gives the Hatam term poeng-e-kom (= pung-a gom 'family-CIT one'), as
                                                                        ,
meaning 'a number of (localised) kin groups with a common origin .3 He wrestled with the
vague and contradictory ways in which this term was used. It seems to me that basically his
understanding of pung was correct. The confusion arises mainly when indigenous
relationships are expressed in local Malay, when loan words such as Jam (Dutch 'famille'),
Biak keret4, or Indonesian suku 'tribe' are used to capture the various extensions of the
concept pungo The concept of pung seems to be applicable to ever-increasing concentric
circles defining an in-group, depending on who the out-group is. Thus, the smallest unit of
pung is the group of people as defined by Pouwer. A larger unit may comprise a whole
dialect or language group, when for example the Tinam are set off against the Miriei, or the
Mirei and Tinam together against the Meyah.
   Since Hatam follows an ambilineal system of descent, one can trace one's pung through
either father or mother in order to lay some claim on a piece of land. Thus, according to the
Uncen report (Tim PSL Uncen 1 9 89:8), land is owned by a group of descendants of an
ancestor who had originally claimed a piece of land by laying out his garden in an area
demarcated by some natural boundary, such as a mountain or river. Ownership of land
implies at least the right to lay out gardens, to cut wood for housing, to hunt. People
belonging to other families may walk freely through such an area, but they may not make use
of its resources. The land is inherited by male descendants, although female descendants are

    Originally from Salawati jilet 'family', according to I.S. Kijne in a personal letter to F. Kamrna ( 1 6 March
    1 954).
4    Ger P. Reesinkallowed to make use of the land (Uncen 1 989:32-3 3). Occasionally, land was (and is) 'sold'
for kain timur and pigs, but this does not mean that ownership of the original family has
completely disappeared. As an example, the Uncen report refers to a Sougb man who bought
land at M inyambou, or Hatam people from Hingk who settled at Warbederi, originally
owned by the Mansim. That means that the new owner may not sell the land to a third party
without the consent of the original owners (Uncen 1 989 :34). In other words, when words like
'sell' and 'buy' are being used with respect to the land, it is mainly the use of land that is
being traded for money, kain timur or pigs. Land itself is an inalienable property, owned by
people who are linked to the original owner, through a particular narrative.
     Traditionally, an oldest brother with his immediate family occupied a large house together
with the families of younger brothers/cousins. Larger villages were hardly present, even in the
1 950s (Pouwer 1 95 8 : 1 5). Marriage was based on sister-exchange, later developed into an
indirect sister-exchange with bride price (Pouwer 1 95 8 :22, 4 1 ); see for example the text
Kain timur in the Appendix. Settlement is mainly, but not exclusively, patrilocal. To which
pung a person claims to belong, depends on where one's parents live. When a man dies, his
possessions are inherited by his wife and his children.
     The children may include adopted children (Hatam awag = Indonesian budak), who are
seen as legal children, not as slaves or servants. Both the Uncen report (p. 37) and information
I obtained from Yoas I wou5 state explicitly that the Hatam only bought children; they did not
themselves sell them. Children would be bought from the Meyah and Moskona, or from
further to the west. Compare Pans ( 1 960:47), who suggests that representatives from Hatam
and Ayamaru (i.e. Maybrat speakers) would meet each other near the Kamundam, probably
trading in kain timur as well. Two accounts from descendants of such awag I recorded at
Minyambou suggest that those children may have come from further away, obtained through
a transaction or fighting.
     For example, Erens Morum (± 45 years old) tells that the Mandacan bought his great­
grandfather (whose name he doesn't know) from the suku Marum, who lived between
Merdey and Sorong (possibly Maybrat?). He was sold for food (taros) since there was a great
famine in that area. Later his son Tamun was sold by the Mandacan to the Dowansiba people
(= Sougb) near Catubou in exchange for weapons and poison (sorcery materials). The
Dowansiba took care of him until the Second World War. Then Erens' father came to dance
at Coisi, and married a woman from the suku Hatam (as Indonesian loanwords in a Hatam
account), and so Erens and his siblings have become part of the Hatam.
     Similarly, Isak Mandacan (age ± 60 years) from Sinaitosi apparently has Moskona
ancestors. He tells about people from the headwaters of the Wariori (Ambailim), either
Hatam or Sougb, who joined those from a place called Mokngomsi to fight with the Sidai
 (Hatam for Moskona) at Mesrei. The Moskona lived on limestone rock. They shot Isak's
grandfather and captured Isak's father when he was still young (mahan bigyo 'adolescent
not-yet') and brought him to the 'village' Ambailim, at the headwaters of the Wariori.
     I will not try to give a synopsis of the names of groups (pung) given by various Hatam
 informants or those given in the World Wildlife Fund publication (Craven and De Fretes
 1 9 87) and in the Universitas Cenderawasih study (Tim PSL Uncen 1 989). Some families are
 said to make up the suku Moile, others are related to the Sougb or Meyah, other groups are
claimed to be exclusively Tinam. What has become clear so far is that there is a high degree
of intermarriage between Tinam and Sougb, so that many Tinam speakers are also fluent in
Sougb. Quite a few Hatam speakers have a Meyah mother, and can speak that language as5
    The information may not be independent, since Yoas was one of the contributing informants of the Uncen
    report.
                                                                            Introduction       5well. Pouwer ( 1 95 8 :4 1 ) concludes that mutual contacts between Hatam, Sougb and Meyah
have been far more extensive than the strong sense of in-group versus out-group would have
led one to believe. He notes that the Moile restrict their intertribal marriages mainly to the
Hatam (read: Tinam), but that there are many marriages between Hatam (= Tinam) and
Manikion (read: Sougb) or Meyah.
   The end of Yairus' story about Digomang (see Appendix) suggests that some of the Ullo
actually intermarried with people from the islands east of the Bird's Head: the Biak saw
smoke at Mibou, got in their canoes to have a look and sent one of their women to marry
UUo, even though they did not know each other's language. This may be a mythical account
of intermarriage between Hatam and people from the coast or from the islands in the
Cenderawasih Bay, which could be an explanation of the claimed mixed nature of Borai.
Compare also Pans ( 1 960:44-45) who concludes on the basis of various historical sources, as
well as oral tradition, that Hatam and Moiree people had moved to the coastal areas, where
they found the Borai and Waraan tribes. The latter groups had already mixed considerably
with islanders, like the Numfor and Biak speakers. These mixed groups further decreased in
number and distinctiveness through sickness, fighting and intermarriage with the Hatam (and
Moile) population.
   Marriage of Hatam men with women from the islands is not limited to the past. For
example, the cousins Hans and Yoas Iwou married women from Serui and Numfor
respectively.
   This sketchy data on families and intermarriages suggests that the language has had some
influences from both directions: from the Sougb-Meyah-Moskona family to the south-west,
as well as from the Biak-Numfor-Wandamen groups to the east. In the course of this study I
will point out various features that seem to be due to these influences.
   To conclude these anthropological notes, the Hatam kinship system will be presented.
Important factors in the kinship terminology of Hatam are 'age' and 'same sex'. In Ego's
own generation (Go), if Ego and sibling are of the same sex, age determines the choice of the
referring term. If Ego and sibling are of different sex, other terms, undifferentiated for age,
are used. This is also the case when sex of the linking relative is opposite to Ego's. In other
words, cross-cousins are referred to with special terms, undifferentiated for age. A special
relationship (as in so many New Guinea societies) exists between mother's brother and sister's
child.
   Terms for relations across two or three generations are reciprocal: (great-)grandparents
refer to their (great-)grandchildren according to ego's sex, but do not differentiate the sex of
their (great- )grandchildren. These terms are also used by the (great-)grandchildren, but now
disregarding their own sex. The various kinship terms will be given in two sets: the
consanguinal relations will be given for both male and female ego in Table 1 . 1 . The second
set (Table 1 .2) gives the affinal relationships. This table shows that same or different sex and
reciprocity are also important factors in the system of affinal relations. The relations in
parentheses have not been explicitly elicited. The following abbreviations are used:
G = generation; superscripts indicate Ego 's own generation (0), and ascending (+) and
descending n generations; e = elder; y = younger; B = brother; Z = sister; F = father;
M = mother; S = son; D = daughter; Ch = child; H = husband; W = wife.

October-30 November 1 994 and 8 November- I I December 1 99 5 , in M inyambou, in the
kecamatan Warmare, Kabupaten Manokwari, Bird's Head, Irian Jaya. These periods were
too short to afford extensive trekking through the area in order to obtain data on dialectal
differences. Instead, I stayed in Minyambou and collected word lists there and in adjacent
Mbenti. From a few speakers I obtained texts from the oral tradition. But I also recorded a
long personal narrative (Yoas Wonggor from Mbenti) and a sermon, given by Habel Iwou in
the church at Minyambou. These narratives in natural speech could be checked and
elaborated on with the excellent help from the principal of the primary school at M inyambou,
Hans Iwou. The dictionaries compiled by Dick Griffiths allowed me fast access to the
vocabulary of Hatam. A first result of this research was published as 'Explorations in Bert's
Head: Hatam' in Baak et al. ( 1 995).
   Having done some preliminary analysis on this material I returned to the Hatam area in
the fall of 1 995 to verify and increase my data. A few other texts were recorded, some
myths, a short historical account of events during the Second World War, and two short texts
about 'slave'-trade in the Eastern Bird's Head.
   In order to test phonological problems, a number of short sentences with contrasting items
were pronounced by three different speakers, who were prompted in Indonesian. In order to
investigate the status of verb sequences I took sentences from the recorded texts, changed
them into a negative, or a relative construction, manipulated presence or absence of certain
affixation, and asked native speakers what these sentences meant in I ndonesian, or whether
they could be used in a particular situation. The result of this method is that most examples in
this grammar are taken from natural speech, but that the discussion on relative clause and
scope of negation relies more heavily on elicited material. As much as possible, especially
where deemed significant to stress natural language use, I have indicated in brackets from
which recorded text an example is taken. The text references include texts which have not
been included in this volume.
   Throughout this volume I attempt to follow, as much as possible, the established
orthography as employed in the published Hatam material, such as the New Testament. The
most obvious discrepancy concerns the spelling of the negative. I n the established
orthography this is bi 'not', but since I believe the word resembles items spelled with final -ig
(for example, often a noticeable friction following the high vowel-see §2.3 for further
details), I have chosen for the spelling big.
   In spite of the additional information obtained during my second visit to Minyambou,
many questions remain. In particular, the extent of the phonemic status of geminate
consonants cannot be unequivocally stated. Likewise, the status of various elements described
in the morphology and syntax is rather dubious. This is no surprise, of course, considering
that my analysis is based on fieldwork of only eleven weeks. In a sense, it could be
considered to be rather presumptuous to attempt to write a grammar on the basis of such a
short exposure to a language. While I was in the process of revising an earlier version of this
grammar, an even more presumptuous account of the language was published.
   Based on a short trip, Donohue ( 1 997) published a Hatam phonology and grammatical
notes. He does not recognise high vowels in the language, nor any contrast between single and
geminate consonants. He also posits a series of labio-velar consonants, for which there is no
evidence. His ykpe 'house' refers to a compound ig-bei 'house-under'. There are quite a few
data in his paper which show the typical misunderstandings a first survey invariably contains.
For example, he identifies the nasal in nggwen 'sick' and kney 'bad' as the same element,
8    Ger P. Reesinksignalling a strong denial. In fact, there are no other items that relate in the same way as kei
'good' and kanei 'bad' , which suggests that the formal similarity is just accidental. The word
for 'sick', nggwen, is one of many that begin with a homorganic nasal, but gwen does not
exist, as far as I know. So far, a semantic constant between lexical items that differ only in
the presence or absence of an initial homorganic nasal could not be established. To be fair, it
may be that his data are from a different dialect, spoken near the Anggi lakes, which may
have a Beneficiary marker yp, or a coreferential subject marking prefix ho. In the Tinam
dialect, I have not found anything that suggests a particular morphology to indicate
something like a switch-reference mechanism. This is not the place to make an evaluation of
every item in Donohue's paper. The value of a description depends to a degree on the time
one has been exposed to a language. In other words, the present work too may contain a
number of misunderstandings and wrong analyses, which may show up after a more thorough
acquaintance with the language.
   This monograph does not pretend to give more than a preliminary description of Hatam
and I have refrained from extensive discussions of a theoretical nature. This applies in
particular to the phonology, which at first glance appeared to be quite simple, but does
contain a number of problematic issues related to the stress pattern. In the area of syntax , a
theoretical discussion regarding serial verb constructions is avoided. I have simply tried to
arrange my data in such a way that some arguments bearing on that topic can find some
corroboration. Following the chapters on phonology and grammar, I present a few texts, with
annotations.
2 Phonology
2.0 Introduction   Hatam is a language with a strikingly rhythmic pattern, roughly alternating unstressed and
stressed syllables. This will be illustrated and discussed in the final section of this chapter. A
number of problems with regard to the phonological segments are tied up with this pattern.
The contrasts for the consonants and vowels that I consider to be phonemic, as represented in
Tables 2. 1 and 2.2, are limited to monosyllabic words. They will be given in §2. 1 . Although
Griffith's dictionary ( 1 994) lists words with geminates for both voiced and voiceless bilabial
and velar stops, voiced palatal stop and the lateral, I have not found decisive evidence for all
of these. Hence, I have given the suspicious elements in parentheses. The status of geminates
will be discussed in §2.2.
   In word-final position, the distinction in voicing of consonants is neutralised. This will be
shown in §2. 3 . In phonemic transcriptions, therefore, I use the convention of symbolising
archiphonemes in capitals. In §2.4 I discuss the phonemic status of the palatal series, which
has a more restricted distribution than stops and nasals of other points of articulation.
Whereas the discussion in §2. 1 -§2.4 is limited to monosyllabic words, the following topics
concern polysyllabic items. In §2 .5 the preconsonantal nasals will be presented, and in §2.6
the unspecified vowel in unaccented syllables. The vocoid sequences in §2.7 provide further
evidence for the consonantal approximants and phonetic realisation of the unspecified vowel.
In §2.8 the possible consonant clusters are illustrated. The facts from §2.2-§2 . 8 will be
summarised in a discussion of the syllable structure (§2.9), which will then allow us to
appreciate the iambic stress pattern that Hatam utterances display, to be discussed in §2. 1 O.
   Occasionally, I refer to words in the orthography which is used in Griffiths ( 1 994) and
other published Hatam materials. In those cases the Hatam items are given in italics. In the
orthography both rand l occur, even though there is no phonemic contrast. Word-finally, the
orthography appears to distinguish between voiced and voiceless consonants, such as g and k,
even though voicing is neutralised. The unaccented vowel (§2.6) is orthographically
represented as i, and the (alleged) geminates by double consonants, such as tt, and so on.","[18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]"

3.4 Verbs   Verbs function as predicate in verbal clauses. They are prefixed to index person and

   Verbs allow a number of morphological processes, which will be presented after syntactic
features with respect to transitivity have been discussed. The basic difference between
transitive and intransitive verbs is that the former can have an object, but not necessarily
occur with one, whereas the latter do not allow an object.","[66, 67]"

                    1                         Introduction                 1.1 Background                   When the multidisciplinary program ISIR was conceived at the end of 1 992, the focus
                was on the south-west of the Bird's Head peninsula of Irian Jaya. At the same time, we
                realised that a detailed study of languages spoken in the eastern part of the Bird's Head was
                necessary if we wanted to obtain a more complete picture of the so-called West-Papuan
                phylum and other language groups in this area. One intriguing target was what was known as
                a phylum-level isolate in the eastern part of the Bird's Head: Hatam.
                   Not much was known. We knew that missionaries of TEAM (The Evangelical Alliance
                Mission) were working on a bible translation in that language, but no linguistic description
                was available. The oldest information on the language was a (very) short article by Loukotka,
                which contains a few words of the language. ' Cowan ( 1 953) does not contain any Hatam
                material. He presents some data on what he calls Mansibaber, which can be identified as
                Meyah or related Moskona, and Manikion (equated with Mantion), which can be identified
                as Sougb.
                   In Voorhoeve (1 975) and Wurm and Hattori ( 1 98 1 ) Hatam and Borai are treated as
                related languages, clearly separate from neighbouring language groups. In later publications,
                Borai has disappeared and Hatam is listed as an isolate (Voorhoeve ( 1 987a, 1 987b), Silzer
                and Heikkinen ( 1 99 1 )). In fact, Voorhoeve ( 1 9 8 7b:9 1 ) substitutes the name Tinam for
                Hatam and Silzer and Heikkinen ( 1 9 9 1 : 50) include Borai together with a number of other
                names as alternatives for Hatam.
                   Similarly, not much was known about Manikion or Mantion, Meyah or Moskona. As the
                ISIR program started in 1 99 3 we learned that members of the Summer Institute of
                Linguistics were active in Meyah (and Moskona), and that Manikion was in fact a derogatory
                term for people who call themselves Sougb. In Sougb also, TEAM missionaries were
                involved in bible translation, but no linguistic description was available.
                   Our plan, then, was to try to increase our knowledge of these languages, either through our
                own fieldwork or through material from SIL linguists. The main question was: What kind of
                language is Hatam? Related questions were: What is the status of Borai? Does it exist as a
                separate language? Is it possible to get some more information on Sougb?
                   The answer to the first question is found in this monograph, with some preliminary
                information on the related questions provided in this introduction (see § 1 .2).","[14, 15, 16, 17]"
"4. 7.3. 1 Causal leu(o)   The preposition leu 'from' can have a predication as its object, which is given as a reason
for the preceding main clause, as in example (4.22 1 ).
     (4.22 1 )   Ni-ku      nani       ei     biei     behei    leu     nyeni
                 l EXC-hide you        LOC    tree     under    from    we
                 ni-ngon       dut       nani ni-ndig bibor.

                 We will hide you in the forest for we love you very much. [peranga:O 1 1 ]     (4.222)     Ji-gwam      tut    ri
                 2PL-sit      with   GIV

                 Sit along with (them), for it is forbidden that you go see me. [Yairus 2:05 1 ]
     I n some instances of this function, however, the preposition carries the enclitic 0 'or', as
m:
     (4.223)     Paulus lene ngat Disyon            cig       leu-o     mai     big-yo.
                 Paulus then see         Disyon father from-or die               not-yet
                 Paulus then has seen Disyon 's father for he hadn't died yet. [Habel 2:005]
4. 7.3.2 Purposive leubinhyepo and mem gima   The same 'source'-preposition leu is found in a rather complex conjunction expressing 'in
order to'. I analyse leubinhyepo as built up from leu 'from' + bi 'INS' + ni-hyet '3SG-talk' +
po 'ANA(phoric) marker'. Occasionally, in fast speech, this complex is further reduced to
lenhyepo or nhyepo. Consider:
     (4.224)     I-ngginau     nyeni lenhyepo          ni-hyen     na-o,
                 3PL-teach     us    in.order.that     l EXC-raise pig-or

                leubinhyepo nyeni cem ni-ma.
                in.order.that we       too l EXC-get
                They taught us in order that we would raise pigs and stuff, (in order that) we'd
                look for money and buy them (kain timur) in order that we too would get
                (kain timur). [Kain timur:OO 1 8]
   A second way to express a purpose relation is by using the preposition mem (for the
difference between mem and bak 'to, for', see §3 . 1 0) and the nominalised far demonstrative
gi-ma, as illustrated in example (4.225).
   (4.225)      Ni-yok    ei         mem     gi-ma          i-bi-go
                l EXC-put LOC        for     NOM-that       l INC-INS-pay

                brideprice for    woman
                We put them ready in order to pay with them the brideprice for women.
                [Kain timur:004]   (4.226)      Noro nimbumbati          hagom hatitut          yam
                but  member              all   take.care        RECIP
                mem gi-ma              mbut cem, dor cem wim miai             cem.
                for     NOM-that walk too run too fell garden too
                But the members all look after each other in order to walk, as well as to run,
                as well as to lay out gardens. [Habel 1 :035]                       -1
4. 7.3.3 Conditional gino  The nominaliser gi, often compounded with the third person singular no, is used to express
conditions or temporal contingencies, as in:
   (4.227)      Gi-no   di-gwam             bit    jeni   lene         ji-yai
                NOM-3SG I SG-sit            follow you.PL then         2PL-get
                nisindem hi        big.
                power      other not
                If I stay with you, then you (will) not get some power. [Habel 1 :0 1 7]   (4.228)      Gi-no   di-ngat rusa              ug     api     di-kwei        yai
                NOM-3SG I SG-see deer             go     then    I SG-come      do
                mEal,    di-pilei     rusa .
                garden 1 SG-shoot deer
                If/when I saw a deer first then I 'd work the garden, (and) I 'd shoot deer.
                [Wonggor 1 090]
   In fact, it is the nominaliser gi that signals the protasis, since it is also possible to have:
   (4.229)      Gi      taksi kwei     big,    lene ni-bong      ei     Mar.
                NOM taxi       come    not     then l EXC-sleep LOC Warmare
                If no taxi came then we'd sleep at Warmare. [Wonggor 2:075]
1 30   Ger P. Reesink   (4.230)      Nipou      gi  di-pilei   yo,        lene    suar     di-bit
                before     NOM l SG-young yet        then    need     l SG-accompany
                di-cig         ba    ni-huk         hab.
                l SG-father    and l EXC-chase bird
                Before, when I was still young I usually accompanied my father and we'd
                hunt birds. [Hatam II:80]   Example (4.230) shows that conditional gino is also used for general time frames.","[144, 145, 146]"
"When the predicate is itself a noun phrase, non-verbal predications allow either order, as in
(4.27) and (4.28).

   In declarative non-verbal clauses, the predicate is often marked with the Given marker rio
This has the function of 'it is' (see §3 . 1 1 . 1 ) as in example (4.29), which is a comment on an
extralinguistic topic. Compare also (4.30) and (4. 3 1 ) with NPs both as subject and predicate.

    The connective is homophonous with the verb ba 'use', possibly related but not identical to it. Ba in example
    (4.6) cannot carry the subject prefix as ba in (4.5) is required to do. In other words, it does not have verbal
    properties.
80      Ger P. Reesink   The head noun may be an alienable or inalienable noun. The HN may be preceded by a
possessive phrase. This consists of minimally a possessive pronoun which may be preceded
by a possessor noun, which itself may be an inalienably possessed noun, as in:

"3.3 Nouns   The category of nouns in Hatam is defined mainly by syntactic criteria. Nouns may
function as subject or object in a clause and as non-verbal predicates in equative clauses. As
heads of NPs they can be modified by demonstratives and other nominal modifiers. A

3.2 Clitics    Hatam has a number of clitics. These are monosyllabic morphemes, which are
phonologically attached to a number of different word classes. They are mainly unstressed,
but as the discussion of metrical stress indicated, Hatam may shift stress quite easily away
from content words. Although some clitics can indeed never receive stress, some others can
form a iambic peak.
   There are five enclitics. Two occur on clause level: they are interrogative markers -i and
-e, which will be discussed in the section on question words. Two occur mainly on nominal
constituents. The citation marker -a and the inclusive disjunction marker -0 are directly
attached to nouns or the nominal modifiers that may follow in an NP. A third enclitic is the
nominalising device tilsi, which can be attached to nouns, verbs, adjectives and prepositions.
The alternation of its initial consonant is determined by the coda of the preceding syllable. Of
these enclitics, only -0 may receive stress.
   Then there are three proclitics in Hatam: gi- and di- occur with verbs, adjectives and
demonstratives. Neither of these is ever stressed. A third proclitic is a weakened form of the
preposition bak 'for', namely bi- [b�], which has both prepositional and conjunctive functions.
There are instances of stress even on the clitic variant. The three enclitics on nominal
constituents will be discussed first, followed by the three proclitics.",[59]
"In other words, an 'instrument-sequence' necessarily has identical subjects. V I may be any
action verb (not necessarily ba 'use'), as in:     (4. 1 1 4)    Api-no        su         ni-ndab        bi-yai
                   then-3SG      stretch    3SG-hand       INS-take
13   The commas in (4. 1 1 2) represent major pauses in the actual utterance. These suggest that ni-ba duig ngei
     kwen is a repair of the first instance of kwen, specifying the manner of cooking. The pause following this
     clause suggests that binggas dima may be a preposed object of the final predicate ni-yem 'we ate'.
102       Ger P. Reesink                   bikau       mui      yai      bak.

                   (and) gave it to (them). 14 [Yairus 2 :0 1 9]
    If the instrument has not been introduced in a verbal clause, as was the case in examples
(4. 1 1 3) and (4. 1 1 4), but when it is given as a single N(P), linked to the main clause by ba
'and' or lene 'then', the main verb is obligatorily marked with an instrument affix:
     (4. 1 1 5)    Pinda hou        gom lene di-bi-non             hacam-o . . .
                   gun      wind one       then I SG-INS-shoot hawk-or
                   (I had) one shotgun and with that I shot hawks and so on ... [Wonggor 1 :030]The Instrument prefix is liable to 'excessive use' by some speakers. That is, even when no
instrument has been mentioned in the preceding context, main verbs may be prefixed with bi­
to signal that an instrument is understood, as in:     (4. 1 1 6)    Noni      0-bi-bon     hagom                   bi-put              tu

                    After he had made everything so it was finished/ready, he said to his son ...
                    [Habel 1 :006]
4.5.3 Purposive verb sequences   In contrast to Directional and Instrumental constructions, Purposives can be characterised
as Different Subject sequences. In many instances the sequence labeled 'purposive' can also
be interpreted as 'resultative', especially when the utterance refers to a past event, as in
example (4. 1 1 7). Later we will see that negation may sometimes favour a resultative
interpretation, and at other times a purposive one. In many cases the subject of the purposive
or resultative verb is the object of the first verb. Whether the result is expressed by a verb, as
in (4. 1 1 7), or an adjective, as in (4. 1 1 8), in both cases it needs to be marked with the
purposive clitic.'5 The (b) variants are unacceptable.
     (4. 1 1 7) (a) Di-bui      napia      bi-mai.
                    I SG-hit wild.pig PUR-die
                    I killed the wild pig. (lit. I hit the wild pig dead.)
14   Note that no '3SG' is part of the bimorphemic conjunction api-no, which conveys a slightly stronger sense
     of (con-)sequence than api. Recall that third person singular has a zero subject prefix, hence the various
     verbs in (4. 1 1 4) are all uninflected. Perhaps better: only bi-yai is uninflected, while the other verbs are
     covertly inflected as revealed by another person category:           Di-su          di-ndab      bi-yai
           I SG-stretch   I SG-hand    INS-take

          I stretched my hand and with it I got a ripe sweet potato and gave it to them.
15   This clitic may be a weakened form of the preposition bak 'to, for', as suggested in §3.2.6. There are also
     sentences where it seems to be interchangeable with the connective ba 'and'. To add another conjecture,
     these two may well be related historically, if the elision of the final consonant is comparable to that of the
     pronominal forms nok and yok to no and yo.

     This example comes from a sequence of sentences with suar which could also be translated, as in other
     places, as 'usually': nogindin ri suar ni-ba-pa-kep budaya di-ni nok hinsan ei igbei = 'now GIV usually we­
     use-pakai (= Indonesian use)-keep culture this like decoration in house'; noro mem mimbron bu big 'but for
     brideprice again not'.
                                                                                            Syntax        95              (d) *Noni kwei ei Minyambou sindi.
   Those adverbs that convey a more aspectual meaning, such as kikau 'continually ',
haniyai 'quickly' are more mobile. Although they prefer a clause-final position, as in (4.83a),
they can also be found clause-initially (4.8 3b), or directly preceding the predicate, (4. 83c).
    (4.83) (a)    Noni 0-ku         mun di-no        0-nggimang haniyai.
                  he     3SG-bide thing REL-3SG 3SG-steal       quickly
                  He hid what he had stolen quickly.              (b) Haniyai    noni ku        mun di-no    nggimang.
                  quickly    he       hide thing REL-3SG steal
                  Quickly he hid the stolen goods.              (c) Noni haniyai ku         mun di-no                     nggimang.
                  he     quickly hide thing REL-3SG                     steal
                  He quickly hid the stolen goods.
   It seems that a clause-final position is more appropriate for manner adverbs. For example,
a number of adjectives (e.g. kei 'good', kinei 'bad', igbit 'true', cun 'short', jei 'long') and the
adverbs derived from pronouns (no-ngkom 's/he/it-alone') may function as adverbials in
order to specify the manner by which an action is done. They always immediately follow the
predicate (if it is intransitive, as in example (4 .84» , or the object, in case of a transitive
predicate with (pro)nominal object, as in (4.85).
    (4.84)        Nyeni ni-bong                 kei       big.

"3.14 Verbal adjuncts    There are two elements, kep and ser, whose meaning is not easily captured. Inasmuch as
they modify verbs they could be considered to be adverbs. But their syntactic behavior and
semantic impact is such that I discuss them separately as verbal adjuncts. Griffiths ( 1 994:27)
lists two entries for kep: one as an adverb, meaning 'in due time, eventually', another as a
preposition meaning 'on, upon, back'. He also gives two entries for ser: a verb with the
meaning 'to pry out, remove with fingernail as dirt from eyeball or lesion' and another as
preposition, glossed as 'inhibitive morpheme' . Since I have no evidence on a verb-like ser, I
will discuss the uninflected elements only, which I identify as kep having a general meaning
74       Ger P. Reesinkof 'keep onto' and ser meaning 'keeping OUt'. 12 For example, with the verb krau 'grab' the
adjunct kep conveys the meaning of 'holding onto':
     (3. 1 82)    Kwanding krau kep              ingmuig.
                  Kwanding grab keep.onto gourd
                  Kwanding held on to the gourd.
   With position verbs, kep conveys an aspectual meaning of 'durative, habitual', as in gwam
kep 'sit for a long time', ya kep 'stand for a long time', which seem to imply 'being busy
doing something'. With motion verbs the combination with kep is characterised as 'always' or
'usually': mbut kep 'always walk', sgan kep 'always cross (a river)"" cai kep 'enter keep onto' .
The adjunct seems t o be required immediately following the verb, a s i n example ( 3 . 1 83). 1 3
     (3. 1 8 3)    Nani cai      kep           dimbau           dini.
                   s/he enter keep.onto door                    this
                   S/he always enters by this door.
    There are instances where kep and ser seem to be almost synonymous. For example, with
the position verbs ya 'stand' and bang 'lie down' the addition of both kep and ser is glossed in
Indonesian as jaga 'protect, watch', which seems to fit the contexts in examples (3. 1 84) and
(3. 1 85).
     (3 . 1 84)    Ni-heu            hampiab       a,    bisiana              mem
                   1 EXC-carve       bow           or    pronged.arrow        for

"4.6 Relative clauses   Hatam allows relativisation on all syntactic constituents of the clause. The head noun
(HN) is always preposed and referenced by a relative marker at the beginning of the relative
clause (RC). The relative marker that links HN with RC is di JdV -J, which can also be used
with demonstratives and adjectives. In the latter case there is a distinction between straight
attributive adjectives and those linked by di. Let us first look at the simple NP constructions.
   (4. 1 54) (a) wou cun        pima
                 snake short that
                 the short snake           (b) wou di        cun     pima
               snake REL short that
               the snake which is short
    As we saw (§3 . 5 ; §4. 1 .2), adjectives allow the 3SG.POS prefix ni- in both predicative and
attributive position, while verbs do not. Thus, a similar contrast as between (4. 1 54a) and
(4. 1 54b) exists for possessed adjectives:
   (4. 1 55) (a) wou ni-cun          pima
                 snake 3SG-short that
                 that short one of a snake           (b) wou di       nl-cun      pima
               snake REL 3SG-short that
               the snake which is a short one
   The structures of (4. 1 5 5) are not possible for verbs; (4. 1 5 6a) is ungrammatical. But the
relative clause may be introduced by di- or a compound of relative marker and third person
pronoun no, as in (4. 1 56b).
               *
   (4. 1 56) (a) munggwom         ni-pim  pima
                 child            3SG-cry that
                 the child who is crying           (b) munggwom dieno)               pim pima
               child          REL(3SG)       cry that
               the child who is cryingI nstead of die-no) the relativiser can be po, which I gloss as ANAphoric marker, because I
presume it is the same as the anaphoric marker on deictics (with weakened vowel = pi).
                                                                                                Syntax         1 13   The difference between die-no) and po is not clear. In natural texts the former is far more
frequent. Also, I have not seen instances of subject relativisation with po. The marker po may
be a more general reference to something which has been mentioned before, whereas die-no)
seems to be more deictic-specific. That example (4. 1 57) was translated with Indonesian itu
'that' and (4. 1 5 8) without this determiner may be significant.
     (4. 1 5 7)        nab     di-no       di-cig         0-pek
                       pig     REL-3SG l SG-father        3 SG-buy
                       the (that) pig my father bought (= babi yang bapak beli itu)     (4. 1 5 8)        nab     po       di-cig      0-pek

                       (the/a) pig that my father bought (= babi yang bapak beli)
    Another indication of this deictic-specific versus general anaphoric opposition between
die -no) and po is the fact that relative clauses with a free pronoun as Head do not allow po as
relativiser, as illustrated in (4. 1 59)?'
     (4. 1 59) (a) no die-no)          di-ngat annani
                   3SG REL(-3SG) l SG-see yesterday
                   the one I saw yesterday                   (b) *no po di-ngat annani
   In the following sections I will give examples of relative clauses with HN in different
syntactic functions: subject (§4.6 . 1 ); object (§4.6.2); instrument (§4.6.3); oblique object
(§4 .6.4); possessor (§4.6. 5). Some examples will include extractions from sequences as
discussed in §4.5.","[128, 129]"

57   In this one sentence, the narrator tells about the descent of Anggos into a traditional house: bot nai are the
     upper rafters, supporting the roof; bot dihyei are the rafters that support the bot nai. Further down one
     encounters two racks, the upper one, pak, holds the firewood, the lower one, srou forms the sleeping place
     for humans. The word dihyeisi usually refers to the earth in general. Dihyei is 'ground, soil, land' and
     appears to be made up of the relative marker di plus the verb hyei 'grow, protrude'. The form do following
     gwam is an enigma, it is followed by a pause which suggests a repair in the utterance.
58   It is very likely that the schwas on ni-ntab reflect the citation clitic -a 'CIT', allowing for the OV order in
     some of the clauses in line (23). Notice also that final consonants may easily be dropped, as in nta, but also
     in ni-mat 3SG-vagina', which is then compounded with ntab 'hair'. The verb kim has the specific meaning
     of 'tying something to something else'.

   There is not a clear difference between prenominal and postnominal possessives. It seems
that in unelicited material postnominal possessives occur when they are encliticised with the
plural nya, as also in:
    (4. 1 4) (a)   Lene   it       (0)       tai    ig    ni-kou-kou

                   Then he planted (the bamboo spikes) around the yard of his house, grabbed his
                   dogs and threw (them) and . . . (they hit the spikes and were finished).

                  We who constitute the Iwou family.
    Both emphatic and exclusive forms are glossed in Indonesian as sendiri 'self'; neither
should be taken as 'reflexive' pronoun. Reflexivity is automatic with same person categories
in subject and object:
     (3.9)        Di-/a-miap     da(-ntiYna(-nti)             di-/a-mbrab.
                  1 SG/2SG-hear me(EMPH)/you(EMPH) 1 SG/2SG-speak
                  I/you hear my/yourself speak (e.g. on tape-recorder).
     The same referentiality holds for complement clauses:
     (3. 1 0)     Nonii    pai    pia      nonii       mpu      nonii'
                  3SG      say QUOT 3SG help 3SG
                  Slhe said that s/he would help herlhimself.
   Reflexivity is cancelled by determining the object pronoun by means of a demonstrative
di-ma 'REL-that' or di hi-ter 'REL other/one-different':
     (3 . 1 1 )   Nonii    pai    pia          nonii     mpu
                  3SG      say    QUOT         3SG       help                  no      di      hi-terj -
                  3SG REL other-differentj
                  Slhej said that slhej would help herlhimj '   Similarly, the subject of the complement clause may be marked for a different referent
with the unmarked pronoun in the object position being co-referential with the subject of the
matrix clause:
     (3. 1 2)     Nonii pai      pia      no     di-maj      mpu         nonii'
                  3SG say QUOT 3SG REL-that help                         3SG

48   Three comments with regard to (5): (i) This line illustrates the well-known phenomenon in Papuan languages
     of Tail-Head linkage, i.e. a new sentence starts off with a repetition of the final material of the preceding
     sentence. There are a number of occurrences of T-H linkage in this and other texts.
     (ii) From speakers of both Moile and Tinam dialects I have recorded [at;;Jmai). It is not clear why the
     realisation here involves a nasal before the alveolar stop. (iii) The verbs pilei 'shoot with arrow' and ndei
     'hit' (Indonesian gloss kena) are contracted to [frindei).
                            =49   It is not clear whether the sounds [bua] indeed reflect the indicated gloss.
50   The word for 'dying of fire' is mu. It seems an epenthetic homorganic vowel serves to link the nominal
                                                                        ,
     subject hum 'fire' with its predicate mu 'extinguish (intransitive) . Similarly in the Tail-Head linkage of ( 1 0).

"But ri is not restricted to non-verbal predications. It also figures in sentences like (4.36) and
(4.37), which, in analogy to non-verbal predications, can be interpreted as being nominalised
by the presence of rio The declarative in (4.36) has the force of a command, while the ri­
marked clause in (4 . 3 7) forms a nominal to which the Topic marker ne can be applied with
an interrogative, i.e. rising, intonation.    (4.36)        li-gwam     tut      ril

  The pronominal form nok '3SG' seems to function as a preposition, meaning 'be like',
which then forms a preposition phrase in non-verbal predication, as in:
    (4. 38)       Nyeni nok munggwom mlen he.
                  we     like child            small just

4.5. 6. 6 Negation and speech verb + complement   Similarly, different interpretations of the scope of negation are possible for negative
sentences with a speech verb as main predicate. Consider:
     (4. 1 49) (a) Noni 0-jem       da di-kwei         big
                   he     3SG-call me 1 SG-come not
                   He called me to come but I didn't come
19   Hans Iwou interpretes (4. 1 46a) as That (means) one does not use a machete to fell the tree, but one uses
     something else'. He also claims that (4. 1 46b), that is di·ba hamboi di·bi·wim biei nora di·wim big 'I took a
     machete to fell the tree but 1 didn't fell it' should make a possibility or wish explicit, as in:
          Di·pi            bi·di·ba             hamboi       wim       biei
          I SG·intend      PUR· ! SG·use        machete      fell      tree
          noro     di·wim       big.
          but      I SG· fell   not
          I intended to use a machete to fell the tree, but I didn't fell (it).
                                                                                            Syntax         111This is the first interpretation given by informants, similar to '(x) hit pig but it didn't die'.
However, it can also be continued by:                   (b) norD di-ngon       kan-ti           mem      di-kwei.
                       but     l SG-heart know-NOM         for      l SG-come
                       but I came on my own accord.20
   The same order of interpretations is valid for example (4. 1 50), which differs from (4. 1 49)
only in the presence of the purposive marker on the second conjunct.
     (4. 1 50)         Noni   0-jem     da    bi-di-kwei      big.
                       s/he   3SG-call me PUR - 1 SG-come not
                       (a)    He didn't call me to come.
                       (b)    He called me but I didn't come.
   Contrary to (4. 1 49) and (4. 1 50), the interpretation of (4. 1 5 1 ) applies the negation only to
the first predicate: 'He did not invite me or call me (to come)':
     (4. 1 5 1 )       Noni 0-jem          da kwei big.
                       he     3SG-call me come not
                       He didn't call me to come.","[126, 127]"

4.5.2 Instrumental verb sequences   As mentioned in the introduction to this chapter, Hatam does not allow Instruments as
clausal constituents. They are introduced either as object of an initial clause with ba 'use' or
another manipulative verb, or as a single NP connected to the main predicate with ba 'and' or
lene 'then'. The verb in the main predicate is instrumental, i.e. stem + prefix bi-. If the
instrument has been given as object of an initial clause, the main verb does not require a
subject prefix:
     (4. 1 1 1 )   I -ba         lat       (i-)bi-ttei   no di                   nggwen

                   3PL-go towards ship REL-fly
                   They carry the sick person on a stretcher to the airplane. (lit. They use a
                   stretcher and (they) use carry the one who is sick they go towards the
                   airplane.)
    It is not necessary to mark V2 with the INS-prefix, as shown in unelicited examples
(4. 1 1 2) and (4. 1 1 3):
     (4. 1 1 2)    Api,     ni-kwen,         ni-ba     duig             ngei

                   I pierced the pig with a knife.",[117]
"
3.5 Adjectives   It is not easy to find criteria to distinguish adjectives as a separate word class in Hatam.
There are no clear morphological differences, but some syntactic processes do warrant a
distinction. Some examples of typical adjectives are given in example (3 . 8 1 ). Adjectives and
verbs can both be used predicatively, needing a prefix to index person-number of the subject,
which is zero for third person singular, as in (3.82) and (3. 83).

                      S/he is crying.
    The attributive position does make a distinction. Whereas items such as those in example
(3. 8 1 ) can enter an NP as modifier of a noun, as in (3 .84), verbs cannot (3.8 5).
     (3 .84)          wou      cun     dima

                    that crying child
   When a noun is attributively modified by a verb the re1ativiser di has to be used, as in
example (3.86). But this construction is also possible with adjectives, as in (3 .87).
   (3. 86)          Munggwom di           pim pi-ma.

"4.5. 1 Directional verb sequences       Directional verb sequences may be divided into:
(i)       V l = Directional (± Adverbial) + V2
(ii)      V l = Action (± Object) + V2= Directional
(i)       When V I is a directional verb, such as ug 'go (away from deictic centre)' or kwei
          'come (to deictic centre)"" and it is immediately followed by V 2 , then subject
          prefixation is obligatorily absent on the second verb, as in:
       (4.98)      Api ni-kwei       kwen tut       sop-nya -o     munggwom-nya-o.
                   then l EXC-come cook with woman-PL-or child-PL-or

                  I didn't really hear that speech. 8Based upon this information, the conclusion can be drawn that example (4.83a) specifies that
the hiding is done in a quick manner, whereas in (4.8 3b) and (4.8 3c) the adverb is more
sentential: the action followed quickly on some earlier event.
    Similarly, the adverbs bu 'again' and cem 'also' may take various positions according to
the required scope. Consider some examples of cem. In (4.86) cem only has the subject dani
'I' in its scope, in (4.87) the predicate with object is focused on, and in (4. 8 8) it is just the
object dihyei 'ground' which is included as a further possible goal of what one can pay for
with kain timur 'ceremonial cloth'.

                  I also later I will have died (and you will build many houses). [Habel 2:0 1 4]8
    Although I stated as a rule that adverbs are not allowed between predicate and object, the text Dowansiba
    (57}-(58) has two instances of igbit 'true' in just that position, as in:         Munggworn         pi-rna            I-rnlap     igbit   i-cig        big.

   Adverbial phrases or clauses which set the time (see §4 .4. 1 ) are either in initial position as
part of the clause, or they are actually outside the clause proper and linked to the main clause
by a clausal conjunction. In (4.48) above we saw an example with lene 'and, then'; here is
one with api 'then, subsequently':
     (4.89)     Njap di      he     bi-bu         api ni-yem          ba    ngwig.

next section for interaction between these two.","[111, 112]"
"4. 1. 1 Possessives   In §3 .3 . 1 and §3 . 3 .2 the distinction between alienable and inalienable nouns has already
been shown. The latter include reference to body parts and kinship terms, which are all
obligatorily prefixed for person-number of possessor. Recall that these prefixes are identical
to the subject prefixes on verbs, except for third person singular which is zero on verbs, but
ni- on nouns.
   Alienable nouns can be possessed with a possessive pronoun (see §3 . 1 ), or a noun plus
possessive marker de, which also occurs in possessive pronouns. The possessor normally
precedes the possessed item. Thus, we can have di-cig ni-de nab 'my father's pig', as in
example (4.8), or the possessive marker de immediately following the possessing noun, as in:
     (4.9)       Tuhan Allah de          mun di          -bi-bon               n
                 Lord  God POS           thing REL       3SG-INS-make          GIV
                 kes      hon    ni-bou      no-ngkom big.
                 leave    stop   3SG-head 3SG-only not
                 God's things that he made did not stop with only the head.
    Possessive phrases are recursive, as in so many other languages, and the possessed item
does not need to be expressed when it is clear from the immediate context, as illustrated by
(4. 1 0}-(4.1 2).
     (4. 1 0)    Lene    andigpoi,    di-cig      noni    ni-cig     de
                 then    old. man     l SG-father he      3SG-father POS
                 yai    mzal    hi     big.
                 take garden other not
                 Then the old man, my father his father's (father) he did not have a garden.
   The possessive phrase can figure as a nominal predicate, either in a main clause (4. 1 1 ), or
in a relative clause, as di-no Hambong de in (4. 1 2).
     (4. 1 1 )   Jg     di-ni      andigpoi Miller de.
                 house REL-this old. man       Miller POS
                 This house is old man Miller's (house).",[96]

                   2SG-enter come
                   Come in. (= invitation to visitor)
    It would seem that directional verbs as y2 obligatorily lack subject prefixation. 1 1
Apparently, more general motion verbs as y2 do not obey this rule: a-ttei mikwau dini
{lj-mbut tut is not acceptable in the following:
      (4. 1 09)    A-ttei           mikwau      dini       a-mbut          tut
                   2SG-carry        meat        this       2SG-walk        along
                    ba   a-yai       bak     a-sut-bat-nya .
                    and 2SG-take to          2SG-friend-COLL-PL
                    Take this meat (and) go with (it) and give it to your friends.
   As conveyed by the free translations of examples (4. 1 05) and (4. 1 06), the sequence with
directional verb as y2 seems to function more as a unit than when y2 is some other verb, as
in (4. 1 09). Although [V I = transitive + y2= directional] appears to form a tight sequence,
Hatam does not allow a tighter sequence of action + motion verb with the object of y l after
                                                             ,
the motion verb: *di-ttei kwei srat 'I-carry come letter .l2 The unweakened form ba 'and' is
allowed in such sequences, as long as the verb following the connective is marked for person­
number of the subject, indicating it has the same referent as the verb preceding it. Thus, a
natural, i.e. unelicited, sentence as in example (4. 1 1 Oa) has various alternative realisations:
      (4. 1 1 0) (a) Lene    {lj-pilei       hanyen       bu        lene     {lj-nduk
                     then    3SG-shoot       return       again     then     3SG-gather
                    nyeni ba     ni-ttei.       Ba ni-kwei            bam.
                    us     and 1 EXC-carry and 1 EXC-come roast
                    Then he shot (Pig) again and called us together and we carried (it). And we
                    came and roasted (it). [Wonggor 1 :056]
   The first sentence in (4. 1 1 Oa) ends with ni-ttei carrying a final falling intonation, followed
by a (long) pause. It is also possible to merge the two sentences into one, resulting in a
sequence of three verbs, of which only the first one is prefixed. The reason why these three
verbs are asyndetically linked, it seems, is that the second verb is directional kwei. It is
uninflected because it is y2 specifying direction for the transitive verb ttei 'carry', and it is
y l with respect to bam 'roast':
      (4. 1 1 0) (b) lene {lj-nduk        nyeni ni-ttei         {lj-kwei                       (lj-bam . . .

                     then he gathered us we carried, came, roasted . . .",[116]
"                   Gi-ma-ri-no                   nyeni ni-kan-kan                      ni-kwei

                   Therefore then we don't know where we come from. [Yairus 1 :003-004]
30   Since this is natural speech with quite a few heavy pauses, suggesting some repairs, it is difficult to interpret
     each morpheme and thus the syntactic relation between the elements of this utterance. The point of this
     example, however, is that it is followed by the complex gimarine, indicating something like 'well then... '.
Appendix: Texts
   This Appendix presents five narratives. I have chosen four myths, given by the speakers in
response to my request for ceritera asal-usul 'origin myths' and one account of the kain
timur 'traditional ceremonial cloths'. These stories thus have a dual function. They illustrate
various grammatical patterns, described in this monograph, while at the same time providing
material which can be used in comparative anthropological research.
   The first stories, Digomang and Anggos, were part of a long monologue (± 50 minutes) by
Yairus Dowansiba, an aidpost orderly at the health centre of M inyambou. The myth of
Digomang followed his attempt to explain to me the demographic divisions of the (Eastern)
Bird's Head. This story evolved in a long list of names of people who together make up the
family UUo. Following that he added the Anggos story.
   The next two texts were told by the old man Tuantiei Dowansiba. I had been told that he
was a renowned story teller. So I went to look for him. A few children took me up the
mountain towards his garden. There he sat down along a path and indicated that I should
switch on my tape-recorder. He told me the ceritera asal-usul related to the family of
Dowansiba . This family originates from the area around the Anggi lakes, about three days by
foot to the south of Minyambou. A few days later, on a Sunday afternoon, he knocked on my
door and told me that he had another story for me: Kwanding. In this latter story we hear
about the 'man-without-body-orifices'. Most likely, it is part of a larger story including
Dowansiba as well.
   Finally, during my second visit to Minyambou, in 1 995, I recorded the account of the kain
timur. The secretary of the aparat desa 'village council', Yoas Iwou, was eager to tell me
about the cloth he had as a decoration in his house. He told me that the Hatam only recently
had come into contact with kain timur. Roughly about four generations ago (at the beginning
of this century) they began to acquire them out of a southern direction, from around Bintuni.
   The cloths were used as brideprice, but also to acquire land or even 'slaves', i.e. young
children bought from the Sougb, Meyah, Moskona, or from further south-east to be adopted
as children. Yoas introduced me to two men, whose grandfathers had arrived among the
Hatam as awag, which is glossed as budak 'servant, slave' in Indonesian. Awag refers to
(orphaned) children who are adopted as extra labourers or marriage partners.
   The stories are presented with morpheme-by-morpheme glosses and free translations. I
have used the standard orthography used in Hatam reading materials, as much as possible.
The major difference concerns the spelling of bi 'not ', which I spell big, since I believe it is
phonologically similar to other items spelled with final -ig (see §2.3). Also, I have recorded a
number of clitic schwas, which I leave unglossed, since I am not certain that they represent
the citation morpheme -a. At various places I have adjusted final consonants. Some items are
given in Griffiths ( 1 994) with final voiced or voiceless consonants, but, as I indicated in the
phonology discussion, this distinction is neutralised in final position. When a vowel follows,
they are always realised as voiced, while preceding a consonant they are voiceless
unaspirated, and before a pause they fluctuate between unreleased or fully released voiceless
stops.
                                                                                                   Texts      1 33   In order to make opaque syntactic structures more transparent I have indicated significant
pauses by a slash. This correlates for almost 1 00% with a rising intonation, signalling that
there is more to come. A falling contour on the final syllable indicates that a sentence has
come to its end. This is indicated with #. In the free translations I have tried to correlate
slashes with commas and # with full stops. Thus natural speech, which is hardly ever
delivered in the neat syntactic structures native speakers offer out of context, is maintained.
This allows the reader to understand apparent diversions from claims made in the grammar
regarding word order or presence/absence of certain morphological markers. At the same
time, at a number of places the recorded material is not clear enough to chose between
certain possible alternatives. This has been indicated in footnotes throughout the texts.
Indonesian loans, which occur sparingly in the four myths but are rather frequent in the text
about Kain Timur, are indicated in bold print.","[147, 148, 149]"
"2.10 Metrical stress    All lexical items, whether monosyllabic or polysyllabic, allow stress marking, including
CV verbs, such as jo 'be somewhere', ku 'to hide'; nouns, such as b u 'nettle leaf', mo
'shrimp' ; adverbs, such as bu 'again' , and function words, such as ei 'at; to' and ba 'and'.
As mentioned with regard to bisyllabic words, the first syllable is never stressed, except in
two instances. Firstly, the suffix -ni on personal pronouns can never receive stress. Thus dani
'1', nyeni 'we' are never [da. 'ni] or [fie . 'ni]. Secondly, the clitic -a on citation forms of nouns
may never receive stress:
     (2.57)     igya           Jig-aJ         house-IND             =   ['iy.ya]
                sara           Jsar-aJ        lattice-IND           =   ['sa.ra]     (2.58)     nungugw-a        [nu. 'IJu.gwa]    mountain
                guri-a           [gu. 'ri.ya]      chicken
    Notice that I formulated the stress rule for words in isolation in negative terms. Whereas
suffixed pronouns and monosyllabic nouns show a trochaic pattern, bisyllabic words with or
without a final clitic suggest a iambic pattern. But when these words occur in running speech,
no rule can positively specify which syllable should be assigned stress. Only negatively, first
syllables of polysyllabic words (whether mono- or poly morphemic) can never be stressed,
suggesting a phrasal iambic metrical stress. Accent in Hatam cannot be stated in terms of
word pattern. It is related to a whole utterance or phrasal part thereof. Following a pause, or a
single long syllable, such as the connective ba 'and', a trough comes (almost) always first, as
in:
     (2.5 9)
                [ni.fi£ IJ.rI.n::>.bl .ji.bu.j£m. J Ba.rnI.fias.d;:).ni]

                Its name is bijibugjem. And the cloth [kain timur] . . . [Kain timur:003J4]The qualification of 'almost' is necessary, since the free personal pronouns, when suffixed,
always have the first syllable stressed: da-ni 'I-this' etc.
   The sequence of iambs in Hatam seems to be quite regular and gives a distinctive
rhythmic impression. A sequence of bisyllabic words in an NP maintains stress on words of
different classes in the following:
                                                                                 Phonology     33   (2.60)

                The very big goanna (is) the one that....[Hans:007]
   Content words, like monosyllabic verbs or nouns, do not necessarily attract stress. It
apparently depends on the overall pattern in the clause. For example, in (2.6 1 ), which
answers the question where a certain item can be found, [no.jo] forms the first iamb, with /jo/
being the peak.
   (2.6 1 )

"The (a) variant of example (3.68) is said either before or after the subject referent actually
walks on the path, whereas (b) is said while the speaker is walking on the path. Other motion
verbs, such as ngkwei 'return', dor 'run', nang 'flee', mba 'fly' are less likely to take a direct
object.
    Position verbs, i.e. jo 'be at (inanimate subjects)"" gwam 'sit ', bong 'sleepllie down', ya
'stand' occur with or without a preposition:
    (3.69) (a) Di-bong      ei     kwo              dip.
