3: Free/SOV constituent order:
        “Constituent order is relatively free in Andean languages, although there seems to be a
preference for the order in which subject/actor and object precede the verb (SOV)” (Adelaar
2008:26).
        This holds true for Kamsá: it has very free word order. The language seems to be SOV
but because the word order is so free, and perhaps because of the influence of Spanish, it is not
clear yet what should be considered its basic word order, if anything.",[42]
"
1.6.3   Word order and syntax
        The basic order of basic constituents in Kamsá seems to be SOV but it is extremely
flexible and is also perhaps becoming SVO under the influence of Spanish. Kamsá is dependent-                                                 27
marking, with possessors being marked morphologically rather than the thing possessed. The
language also exhibits agreement, with adjectives agreeing with nouns in class, number, and
sometimes case. Oblique phrases tend to follow the subject of the clause and can precede or
follow the verb. Negators almost always precede verbs. Kamsá has mostly postpositions,
although it also has some prepositions that it has borrowed from Spanish. There are some
subordinators that are clause-initial and others that are clause final. In possessive constructions,
the possessor precedes the possessum (possessed) and is marked with a genitive case ending.
Adjectives can either follow or precede the nouns that they modify. Demonstratives and
numerals always precede nouns. Kamsá may be considered a pro-drop language, in that an overt
subject is not a necessary syntactic element.
        Kamsá has nominative-accusative morphosyntactic alignment. In the third person, S and
A (not O) trigger verbal agreement. There can be also object marking on verbs, mainly for first
and second person objects. When the verb is ditransitive, if the goal is first or second person, it is
marked on the verb (not the theme). Kamsá has a strange characteristic of having dual marking
when there is a transitive sentence with an animate agent and patient. This could be polysemy.
        There is wh-movement for questions: question words always come at the beginning of the
clause. Polar (‘yes/no’) questions do not necessitate any change in word order, and no special
particle is needed, although the tag aiñ o ndoñ ‘yes or no’ is commonly added to the end of the
question with a difference in intonation. Comparatives and superlatives are formed with the
Spanish loanword más ‘more’. Both nouns and adjectives can function as predicate
complements, either without a copula or with an inflected ‘be’ verb.","[40, 41]"

8.3.1   VPs consisting entirely of a single verb
        A verb phrase can consist of just a verb (without any other constituents) as seen in (20a),
where the verb jwenatjëmban ‘disappear’ is marked for person, number, and TAM. The prefix
tën- ‘3SG’ indexes the third person singular subject washëntsayá ‘sower’. There is no object,
oblique, adverb, or postposition within the VP. In (20a), the verb phrase contains nothing but a
verb, and the object of the verb that is not present as a full noun is indicated by a cross-
referencing prefix on the verb (k- ‘2SG)’. The prefix b- (which follows the object marker) indexes
a first person singular subject; and the prefix at- marks the mood of the verb as irrealis.(20a) Ndayek tënjwenatjëmba ch washëntsayá?
      ndayek        tën-j-wenatjëmba            ch             washëntsayá
      why           3SG.R.PST-VERB-disappear    DET            sower

      yes    2SG-1SG-IRR-VERB-bring
      ‘Yes I will bring you.’ (Chindoy 62:16)8.3.2   VPs with a direct object
        Verb phrases can have expressed direct objects. As there is no case marking on any
nominals (including pronouns) to indicate their role as subject or (direct) object in Kamsá, there
is no morphological difference between subjects and objects. Also, because the word order in
Kamsá is very free, it is generally not possible to use word order to discern which NP is the
subject and which is the object in a transitive clause. In (21), there is no expressed subject; the
NP mongoj ‘deer’ is the direct object of the verb. There is no extra morphology on mongoj to
indicate what its role in the sentence is.","[216, 217]"
"
9.2.1    Intransitive clauses
         In intransitive sentences, the word order is almost always SV, whether the subject is a
pronoun or a noun. In (2a) the verb j-ashjajna ‘arrive’ is preceded by bobonts-ënga ‘young men’.
In (2b) j-abokna ‘leave’ is preceded by oso ‘bear’. In (2c) j-abostero ‘lie’ is preceded by the first
person singular pronoun ats̈ whereas in (2d) j-amanan ‘sleep’ doesn’t have any overt subject, but
the prefix së- on the verb shows that it is first person singular. In (2e) j-asapten ‘rain’ is inflected
as third person singular. Although the subject usually precedes the verb, in (2f) the subject kanÿe
baká wabon ‘one horrible spirit’ follows the verb jashjango ‘arrive’. It is possible that in
intransitive sentences the subject is more likely to follow the verb if it is heavier as in (2f) in
which the subject is kanÿe baká wabon bachnaj kapuchinká pormaná ‘one horrible spirit dressed
as a priest’, but more research is needed.(2a)     ch bobontsënga mojashjajna
         ch     bobonts-ënga mo-j-ashjajna
         DET    young.man-PL 3PL-VBLZ-arrive
         ‘The young men arrived.’ (Chindoy 78:16) 2626
  There seems to be a lexical difference between j-ashjango ‘arrive (one person)’ j-ashjajna ‘arrive (multiple
people). It doesn’t seem to be explicable by morphology, especially considering that -ng- is a plural marker, not a
singular marker

        ‘A horrible spirit, dressed as a capuchin priest, arrived.’ (Chindoy)9.2.2   Predicative with jamnan ‘be’
        Predicative clauses are formed with j-amn-an ‘be’. It is inflected in the same way as other
Kamsá verbs. The word order is flexible. In (3a) tsbwanach ‘leaf’ is bëts ‘big’. Note that the
adjective agrees with the class of the noun. In (3b) santopes ‘centipede’ is a botaman shembasa
‘beautiful woman’. In (3c) j-amn-an ‘be’ is used for location yebën-ents̈ ‘in the house’. Similarly
in (3d) jamnan is used for location chents̈ ‘there’ and is marked with the third person plural
prefix mo- to agree with the plural subject. In (3d-f) other persons are shown. In (3g) the
personal pronoun is not used, but the verbal inflection shows that it is second person plural,
indicated by s̈mo-.
        The verb j-amn-an is inflected for TAM in addition to person and number. In (3a) it has
the marker nd- to show a habitual state, whereas in (3b) it is distant past because it is in a
traditional story. In addition, the adjectives agree with the nouns or pronouns. In (3a) the                                                 216
adjective agrees with the class of the noun and in (3f) and (3g) wayan ‘hated’ agrees with ‘you
all’ and ‘we’ in number, shown by the plural marker -ëng.(3a)    kem tsbwanach bëtsich indemën

        Transitive clauses have very free word order, so much so that some have asserted that
Kamsá has no dominant word order (Fabre 2001). In his typological sketch of Kamsá, Fabre says
                                                217
that out of one hundred instances he found a slight predominance of VERB + PATIENT (56%).
Most AGENT NPs appear first, but the inverse order is not rare either (Fabre 2001).
        The following examples show various options for word order. In (4a) and (4b) the word
order is SVO and in (4c) and (4d) it is SOV.(4a)    ch bobonts tojashwa shlobts̈
        ch     bobonts       to-j-ashwa               shlobts̈

        Carmen       one      lulo-CLF   3SG.PST-EVI-VBLZ-choose
        ‘Carmen chose a lulo fruit.’9.2.4   Clauses with complements
        Clauses where the verb has a complement tend to have the following word order:
        subject - verb - complement.
If the complement has an object, that object precedes the verbal complement. In (5a) the verb j-
onts̈á ‘begin’ has the complement j-akwentan ‘tell’. The oblique shachbuyek ‘with tears’
precedes both the verb and the complement. In (5b) and (5c), intransitive verbs have verbal
complements. In (5d) j-oben ‘be able to’ has a complement, and in (5e) j-anpochoká ‘stop’. The
word order in (5e) is different, perhaps because it is part of a subordinate clause. The verbs j-
onts̈á ‘begin’, j-oben ‘be able to’ and j-anpochoká ‘stop’ all commonly take complements. The
verb in the complement is almost always non-finite, nominal in form.","[228, 229, 230, 231]"

        ‘I come with music.’ (Chindoy 85.3)        In (4), the first person singular is the subject and the independent pronoun is present, but
the direct object, the second person singular, is marked on the verb and does not appear as an
independent pronoun.(4)     ats̈ chekbojamanda chka

        ‘I will order you thus.’ (Chindoy 62.21)        In (5), ats̈ is used as the independent object pronoun. It is the first word in the sentence.
The verb also is marked for first person singular object, as well as with m- for imperative. Note
that ats̈ here, when it is an object, has the same form as when it is a subject (as in (4)) but the
verbal morphology is different.(5)     ats̈ mwents̈e s̈mëntjofja

        ‘Invite me here (command)’ (Chindoy 93.1)        In (6), there is no independent subject pronoun or object pronoun. Both are marked only
on the verb. The subject is marked with mo- which agrees with third person plural subjects. The
object is marked with k-, the marker for second person objects. Note that the object agreement
marker precedes the subject agreement marker on the verb. This is discussed more in 4.3 on
object marking prefixes on verbs.(6)     k-mo-n-chan-tse-shbwas

5.1.4     Pronoun cases
          Each pronoun in Kamsá can take a variety of case markers, all of which are suffixes, and
postpositions. They are the same as the case markers discussed in Chapter 2.2.3, and the case
markers that require the animate marker -bi for animate nouns, are the same for pronouns. Thus,
the allative and benefactive both require -bi, whereas the genitive -be does not, and the
comitative is -abtak, perhaps deriving from -bi + -ak. Figure 5.2 summarizes the pronoun forms
of the genitive, allative, benefactive, and comitative.","[152, 153, 154]"
"
9.6.1     Yes/no
          Yes/no questions can have any order. They often end with the tag aiñe o ndoñ ‘yes or
no?’ In (20a) the clause is verb final, whereas in (20b) the main verb jan ‘go’ is first with the
complement jenokwedam ‘eat together’ and the deictic ‘to there’ following it. In (20c) the verb
jan ‘go’ shows different morphology than the usual affirmative tonja for the third singular past.
Also, the question ends with the tag aiñe o ndoñ. In (20d) the word order is OSV and the
question ends with the particle ka. (20e) shows a longer yes/no question with an embedded
clause.",[242]
"
8.2    Noun phrases
       A noun phrase consists minimally of a noun (common or proper), pronoun (personal or
indefinite), substantive determiner (demonstrative: ch ‘the’; kem ‘that’; mwa ‘that’ or inÿe
‘other’, all functioning as a noun ) or substantive numeral (number functioning as a noun). Noun
phrases can include other constituents, such as determiners, adjectives, and prenominal numerals.
They also have case markers, which tend to go on the noun but can also occur at the end of the
entire NP or on multiple constituents in the NP, namely the noun and an adjective that agrees
with the noun. Some constituents of an NP can exhibit overt agreement with the head noun,
indexing the same semantic case and noun class or reflecting the same evaluative suffix as the
noun. Adjectives have class suffixes that agree with their nouns. Additionally, determiners, some
pronouns, and numerals in certain environments bear class suffixes that agree with the classes of
their referents, namely when they follow the noun or when they are in a different NP from the
noun that they agree with, as discussed in 6.3. Furthermore, a number of NP constituents are
marked with evaluative suffixes when they follow or are used substantively: nouns, pronouns,
adjectives, determiners, and numerals, both within a noun phrase or across noun phrases (see
                                                193
3.3.2 for evaluatives). Sometimes these constituents will have evaluative suffixes when they
precede a noun, but generally not.
        Determiners and numerals always precede the heads of noun phrases, with determiners
preceding numerals. Adjectives generally follow the noun, but due to the free word order of
Kamsá they can sometimes precede the noun. There seems to be no appreciable difference in
meaning. Possessors always precede the noun.
        Thus, the order of constituents in a NP is as follows:        [determiner] [possessor] [numeral] [adjective] [noun] [adjective] [adjective]
8.2.1   Heads of noun phrases
        The head of a noun phrase is often a noun, but can also be a non-archetypical nominal,
such as substantive adjectives, personal pronouns, numerals, and determiners (used
substantively). Numbers and determiners always precede the noun, whereas adjectives can
precede or follow the noun.
        If a personal pronoun is the head of the noun phrase, then no other constituents are
permitted. However, the pronoun can exhibit case marking and/or bear an evaluative suffix, with
the case marking always at the end of the noun phrase. Because indefinite pronouns do not show
up frequently in my corpus it is not clear if there can be other constituents in a noun phrase
headed by an indefinite pronoun or what suffixes and clitics can be marked. Two determiners,
the demonstrative kem ‘this, that’ and inÿe ‘other’ can also be heads of NPs when used
substantively. The definite article ch can also stand alone as an NP, but it is more common for
the third person singular pronoun cha, to serve as the entire NP, (8.2.1.2). Determiners are
discussed in 5.4 but here are simply defined as words that show definiteness and/or specificity
and precede the noun (as opposed to adjectives which can precede or follow the noun).
        The following subsections detail the use of various word categories as heads of NPs.","[206, 207]"

clause when WH questions are formed. The only words that can precede question word are
adverbs. Subjects, objects, and verbs always come after the question word. The remaining

        First, I would like to thank all of the Kamsás who welcomed me into their lives: Carmen,
without whom nothing would have been possible; Margarita, Clemencia, Anita, and Maria
Clementina for teaching me their language; Alejandro for all the wonderful conversations about
language, philosophy, and life; as well as Margarita, Andrés, Ivan, Miguel, Luis, Sandra, and
Rosita.
        I have been extremely lucky to have worked with Lyle Campbell, who is the best advisor
anyone could ever hope for. I would also like to thank my committee members, William
O’Grady, Gary Holton, Bob Blust, and Alex Mawyer; and Robert Littman, who was the reason I
was able to do a graduate degree at the University of Hawai‘i.
        My friends in Bogotá offered me incredible support. I would like to thank Pipe for
dedicating his time to working with me on Kamsá; Gustavo, whose conversations kept me going;
Jennifer for always being willing to accompany me into the jungle; Andrea, one of the most
lovely people in the world; Andrés for the evenings in La Candelaria; Edinson for our lunches
together; Daniel for being my bodyguard; Francisco and Gloria for their hospitality; Lili for
being my Colombian mother and friend; Javier for the inspiration; David for the breaks from el
centro; Leidy for sharing insights about Kamsá; Camilo for being wonderful; Jorge for our
mornings in Juan Valdez; Paul for the walks in the rain; Laura and Rajiv … I don’t know where
to begin; Gerriet for always helping; Arturo for becoming my friend at BBC; Ricardo for our
time together; Fernando for helping me before I knew Spanish; Mauricio for making things a
little more fun; Alejandro and Juan for giving me a home; Yinneth for her great knowledge; Katy
for the chats over coffee; and Youlin for helping me before she even knew me. There have been
many other people in Colombia whom I’m grateful to as well: Luisa for opening her home to me;
Henry in Sibundoy; Gloria in Manizales.
        Some friends from the US visited me during my time in Colombia, making my time there
even more pleasant. I’d like to thank John for making the first trip to Sibundoy with me; Ariane
for staying in touch … hopefully we see each other more; Noah, these years have been crazy;
Erik for always being there to talk and helping edit more drafts of things than I can count;
Joachim for being willing to do anything; Craig for being a great friend and going with me to the
beach.
        Other friends who’ve been supportive during my degree, some of whom I’ve known
since elementary school, some I’ve met more recently: Don, Vlad, Laura, Jonathan, and Verna.
I’d also like to thank my parents.
        Other mentors who have guided me during my PhD include Bryan, without whom I may
never have done academia; Caleb for always seeming to believe in me; Thiago for offering
advice along the way in Colombia; and Brett for the advice and contacts, starting in Cambridge.
        I’d like to thank friends and classmates in Hawai‘i who’ve helped in various ways
throughout the PhD process: Eve, Kirsten, Samantha, Kavon, John, Ryan, Sejung, Victoria,
George, Laura, Clara, Kevin, Adila, and Melody.
        I am also grateful for the generous agencies that have helped fund my research including
the Bilinski Foundation, the American Philosophical Society, the American Association of
University Women, and the Foundation for Endangered Languages.
        Finally, I’d like to thank Russell.

                                         ABSTRACT
        This dissertation presents a description of the grammar of Kamsá, an endangered
language isolate spoken in the Putumayo department of southern Colombia. It is the first
developed account of the language’s phonology, morphology, and syntax.
        Kamsá is highly endangered due to the displacement of speakers and language shift. A
reference grammar of a previously under-described language offers a number of potential
benefits to general linguistics, showing what is possible in human languages. In addition to
typologists, comparative and historical linguists are always interested to see whether an assumed
isolate may, in fact, be demonstrably related to a known language family. The increasing
endangerment of Kamsá, heightened by the displacement of Kamsá speakers from their ancestral
home, has made the need for documentation and description extremely urgent, and this grammar
will perhaps be useful for the creation of pedagogical materials, as well.

1.1    Summary
       This dissertation presents a description of the grammar of Kamsá, an endangered
language isolate spoken in the Putumayo department of southern Colombia. It is the first
developed account of the language’s phonology, morphology, and syntax.
       Kamsá is highly endangered due to the displacement of speakers and language shift. A
reference grammar of a previously under-described language offers a number of potential
benefits to general linguistics, showing what is possible in human languages. In addition to
typologists, comparative and historical linguists are always interested to see whether an assumed
isolate may, in fact, be demonstrably related to a known language family. The increasing
endangerment of Kamsá, heightened by the displacement of Kamsá speakers from their ancestral
home, has made the need for documentation and description extremely urgent, and this grammar
will perhaps be useful for the creation of pedagogical materials, as well.
       This introductory chapter to this dissertation is organized as follows:
In 1.2, I discuss the Kamsá people and language, including the location, culture, relationship to
other languages, borrowing, and the name of the language. In 1.3 I discuss the language ecology
and language vitality, and in 1.4 I discuss previous research on the language. In 1.5 I describe my
methodology, and in 1.6 I give a typological overview of the language.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"

      ‘Carmen is cooking mote (hominy soup) at my father-in-law’s.’8.3.6   VPs with adverbs and deictics
        Adverbs and deictics often precede verbs. Adverbs are discussed in greater detail in
Section 7. In (29a), the adverb kachents̈e ‘right there/right then’ precedes the verb jobanan ‘die’.
Similarly, in (29b) kachor ‘right away’ precede the verb jan ‘go’.(29a) I kachents̈e yejoban.
      i      ka-chents̈e ye-joban
      and    INT-there       D.PST-die
      ‘And right there he died.’ (I < Spanish y ‘and’)(29b) Kachor yejá washëntsayoy.

      right.away    3SG-go          sowing.place-ALL
      ‘Right away, she went to the field.’        Often the adverb or deictic occurs between the object and the verb, as seen in (30), where
mwents̈e ‘here’ occurs after the object ats̈ ‘1SG’ and before the verb jofjan ‘invite’. Word order in
Kamsá is very free, however, so these words could go in any order, as discussed in 9.2.","[220, 221]"

9.5.1   Morphological imperatives
        Imperatives are formed with m- before the verb root. There is no other morphology. In
(18a) jabo ‘come’ has m- as does j-olempia ‘clean’ (from Spanish limpiar ‘clean’) in (18b).
(18a) mabo
      mabo
      ‘Come!’ (MC)(18b) Mwata molempia. Kanÿaná kochjase,
      mwa-ta         mo-lempia      kanÿa-ná       ko-ch-jase
      DET-DU         IMP-clean      one=TOP        2SG-FUT-eat
      ‘Clean these two, and eat one of the them.’ (Chindoy 94:6)9.5.2   Future as imperative
        Another common way to make a command is by using the future. In (19a) the verb j-
areparan ‘watch’ is marked with the second singular marker ko- followed by the future prefix                                              228
ch- as in (19b) with jatbana ‘collect’. (19c) is repeated from above and shows both strategies of
command: the morphological imperative mo-lempia ‘Clean!’ and the future as imperative with
kochjase ‘Eat!’.(19a) Pero kochantsareparan ndweñangbiama.
      pero ko-ch-an-ts-areparan          ndweñ-ang-biama
      but    2SG-FUT-?-PROG-watch        owner-PL-BEN
      ‘But watch the owners!’ (Chindoy 101:4)(19b) Akna tsbwanach kochjatbana bien jwashabwayam
      akna            tsbwanach      ko-ch-j-atbana               bien        jwashabwayam
      2SG=TOP         leaf           2SG-FUT-VBLZ-collect         well        VBLZ-cover
      ‘Collect the leaves to cover (the house) well.’ (Chindoy 104:5)(19c) Mwata molempia. Kanÿaná kochjase,
      mwa-ta         mo-lempia      kanÿa-ná       ko-ch-jase
      DET-DU         IMP-clean      one=TOP        2SG-FUT-eat
      ‘Clean these two, and eat one of the them.’ (Chindoy 94:6)9.6       Interrogatives
          Word order in Kamsa is very free. Yes/no questions can have any word order. WH
questions, however, generally have the question word first with other constituents following the
question word. Adverbs can precede the question word. Sometimes the evidentiality is different
with only j- and not n-, the marker for things the speaker has seen or experienced. The verb
jamnan ‘be’ often has the prefix yo- in questions, but I have not determined the use of this prefix.","[241, 242]"

in the question. (21f) and (21g) both have questions with ndayek ‘why’ and have different word
orders: in (21f) it is verb then subject and in (21g) there is no verb. In (21i) the question word

4.3    Object marking on verbs
       In addition to indexing subjects, transitive verbs index objects with bound, obligatory
prefixes. Although grammatical objects need not be overtly expressed as free words (whether
independent personal pronouns or full NPs), it is obligatory to index objects with verbal prefixes
allowing for a null prefix for third person referents; that is to say, first and second person objects
are marked on the verb. First person and second person (object) pronouns can co-occur with
object marking prefixes, although they are not obligatory. The object prefix is the first prefix on
the verb, followed by the subject prefix (which is itself followed by any TAM prefixes). Direct
objects are marked. When the construction is ditransitive, it is the Goal and not the theme that is
marked. This chapter focuses on morphology.
        In most TAM distinctions (excluding, future and conditional), neither third person
subjects nor third person objects are overtly marked on verbs. Although the first person subject
marker and first person object marker have different forms (së- and s̈-, respectively), the second
person object marker is identical to the second person subject marker. Thus, in clauses with third
person subjects and second person objects (or with second person subjects and third person
objects), only the second person argument is overtly marked on the verb (with the prefix k-). It is
thus impossible (from the shape of the verb alone) to determine whether the second person
argument is the subject or the object of the verb.
       The first person object prefix is s̈-, the second person object prefix is k- (the same as its
subject prefix counterpart), and the third person object prefix is null (Ø-). These forms are used
for all TAM distinctions. Number is not marked in any way for object prefixes. Thus, plural
objects never receive the plural marker mo-, nor do dual objects receive the dual marker bo-.
Similarly, neither the portmanteau first person plural subject prefix bsë- nor the portmanteau
second person plural subject prefix s̈mo- has an equivalent object prefix form. Plural first person                                                 104
objects are marked with s̈- and plural second person objects are marked with s̈mo-.
       The first person subject prefix is bo- when the object is second person (regardless of the
number of either the subject or the object). The third person singular subject prefix is also bo-
when the object is third person (regardless of the number of the object). Thus, first person subject
with second object is kbo-, with k- marking the second object and bo- showing that the subject is
first person. The first person singular subject prefix is never bo- when there isn’t an object.
       Object marking is usually the same for non-singular as for singular.
       All of the prefixes that encode subject and object end in o-, so this could perhaps be
analyzable as something to do with transitivity, but it also appears in intransitive verbs.
       Figure 4.2 (on the following page) summarizes the person marking for verbs, showing the
various possible combinations of subject and object prefixes.","[117, 118]"

   Plural marking on the verb is optional. For this sentence we would expect mondëmën as the verb rather than
indëmën, with mo- being the 3rd plural prefix.

       Kamsá does not seem to have reciprocal pronouns. Rather, the reciprocity is marked on
the verb with the prefix en- The verb ‘to say’ takes different morphemes depending on whether
there is a hearer or whether it is mutual as seen in (11): j-ayanan is less transitive, while j-
auyanan, with the /u/ means ‘to tell someone’, and j-enyanan, with /en/ means that the telling is
reciprocal, telling each other. This is discussed more in 4.6.(11)   jayanan ‘say’
       jauyanan ‘tell someone’
       jenyanan ‘tell each other’       The following two examples show the verb j-ayanan ‘to say’ as a reciprocal and with a
hearer. In (12a) the verb has the reciprocal marker en-, and in (12b), the verb has the marker au-
to show that there is a hearer. The hearer is marked with the allative marker -bioy.(12a) enabwatmat (...) bojenyan

       This section discusses the determiners, both articles and demonstratives.
       Kamsá has one article, ch, which is probably related to the third person singular pronoun
cha. It is used for definiteness/specificity but more research is needed. The language has one                                                 144
main demonstrative kem, which basically means ‘this’. Both ch and kem can modify animate and
inanimate nouns, although ch is used very often with animate nouns and not so often with
inanimate nouns. Also, ch is used more when the noun is the subject (which is, of course, related
to the previous observation). kem can also be used for both animate and inanimate nouns. Both
ch and kem, when part of an NP, come at the beginning, regardless of the order of the other
words in the NP and they can both stand alone, not as part of a larger NP. When the determiners
are part of an NP, they do show any overt marking of agreement with the noun, but if they stand
alone, they agree with their referent/antecedent in class, and sometimes in case and/or number. In
addition to ch and kem, there is also kanÿe ‘one’ and inÿa ‘other’ that I include in this section
because they behave similarly to ch and kem, also occurring at the beginning of an NP and
agreeing with their referent/antecedent when they stand alone. Himmelmann uses the following
two criteria to distinguish between articles and demonstratives:
- articles occur only in nominal expressions, whereas demonstratives may appear as pronouns,
adverbials, predicates or adnominal modifiers;
- within the nominal expressions articles occupy a fixed position, either consistently to the left or
to the right of the noun, whereas demonstratives may occur on either side of the noun in many
languages. (Himmelmann 2001:832)
        Kamsá does not seem to have these distinctions. All determiners must go at the beginning
of the NP when they’re part of the NP, and they can all stand alone. That being said, it is rare for
ch to stand alone; ch is extremely frequent as part of an NP, but it rarely stands alone.
        The four determiners discussed in this chapter are presented in Figure 5.3.","[156, 157, 158]"

4.4.2   Past and infinitives: j-
        Past tense is often shown with the prefix j- as well as special person/number prefixes.
Whether this is the same j- as the one at the beginning of an infinitive is unclear. Both are
discussed here: first the j- with uninflected verbs, then j- in past tenses (recent and distant).
        Uninflected verbs can take two forms:        j-root-an: jan ‘go’ and j-abwamiy-an ‘buy’
        or
        j-root-am: jam ‘in order to go’, j-abwamiy-am ‘in order to buy’        Verbs with prefix j- and suffix -an are the citation form, and the complement for other
verbs that take complements. j- and -am show purpose. In (43a) the verb j-abwamiy-an ‘buy’ is
the complement of jobenan ‘be able’ and in (43b) j-abwamiy-am is a purpose clause. -am is also
the benefactive marker for nouns as seen in (43c) with bëng-bi-am ‘for us’, where bi- is used on
animate nouns and pronouns. The syntax of this construction is discussed further in 9.2.4.(43a) tobias̈ indoben mashakbe jabwamiyan

j-wamb-an ‘carry’ has to- and j-. In (44b) j-wamb-an has the distant past marker ye- and j-. In

10.6    Nominalization as an equivalent to relative clauses
        Constructions equivalent to relative clause are formed by nominalizing the verb. More
research is needed to determine if there are relative clauses in the language.
        One strategy to form a structure semantically similar to a relative clause is nominalizing
the verb in the modifying clause by removing prefixes. In (30a) the verb ja-bomn-an ‘have’ does
not have any verbal morphology, and it has the plural marker -ëng (usually used for nouns) as
well as the negation marker nd-. In (30b) the verb ja-bos̈-an ‘want’ and j-oban-an ‘die’ do not
have any verbal morphology (no tense, aspect, mood, person agreement, etc) and have the plural
suffix -ëng. In (30c) there are several examples of these nominalizations. In (30d) there is a lot of
morphology on the verb: t-c-mo-j-ts-ababuánÿeshan-ënga, showing past tense, second person
singular object, third person plural subject. It also has the plural suffix ëng.(30a) y tojanmandá lempe jtsëbáyama base boyabásetemënga

5.2.3   Use of pronouns and alignment: subject and object
        In Kamsá, there is no difference in form between subject and object pronouns, just as
there is no difference in form between subject and object nouns. The language is thus neither
nominative/accusative nor ergative/absolutive in its alignment for pronouns.
        In (2a), the first person singular pronoun ats̈ is the subject of an intransitive sentence,
with jan ‘go’ as the verb. The verb agrees with the subject, shown by the first person singular
subject marking së. In (2b) ats̈ is the subject of a transitive sentence. As in (2a), the verb has the
prefix së- to show that the subject is first person singular. In (2c), ats̈ is the direct object of a
transitive verb. There is no change to ats̈; the form is identical to that in (2a) and (2b). The verb
in (2c) is marked with a first person singular prefix s̈o- to agree with the direct object.","[151, 152]"
"
1.2.4   Borrowing
        Kamsá has a long tradition of lexical borrowed from both Spanish and Inga. More
recently, as the language has come to be spoken less and less, it has become more and more
influenced by Spanish, both lexically and syntactically. This section focuses more on the older
borrowings, especially those forms that have been fully integrated into Kamsá phonotactics or
have undergone sound changes that have somewhat obscured their non-Kamsá etymologies. The
words considered in this section are—largely—considered by native speakers to be “Kamsá”
(regardless of their origins) and they are used commonly in traditional stories, ceremonial
speech, and other speech registers that may be considered “pure” or “traditional”. Thus, these
are—both etically (on the grounds of phonotactics and morphology) and emically (on the
grounds of speaker identification of Kamsá-ness)—fully integrated loanwords as opposed to
instances of code-switching or language loss.
        One obvious semantic domain for borrowing includes vocabulary for fauna, flora,
cultural objects and concepts that did not exist before the arrival of the Spanish. Examples
include: ral ‘money’ (from Spanish real, the old Spanish currency), naranjabe ‘orange’ (from
Spanish naranja ‘orange’), and jatrabaja ‘work’ (from Spanish trabajar ‘work’). All three of
these words exhibit the borrowed phoneme /r/, which suggests that the forms are foreign.
Nevertheless, their integration into Kamsá can be shown both phonologically and
morphologically. First, ral ‘money’ has undergone a phonological reduction, from the disyllabic                                                  12
form re.al to the current monosyllabic ral (the fact that the term real is no longer used in local
Colombian Spanish can obscure the word’s etymology). Second, the from naranjabe ‘orange’
shows a morphological change, having received the noun classifier associated with round
objects, -be (3.2.2). Finally, jatrabaja has undergone the phonological change of the loss of a
final consonant; furthermore, it reveals Kamsá verbal morphology by exhibiting the non-finite
verb marker j(a)- (4), as well as being able to receive TAM morphology.
       Almost all conjunctions (10.2) in Kamsá are borrowed from Spanish, including: o ‘or’
(from Spanish o); i ‘and’ (from Spanish y); pero ‘but’ (from Spanish pero); porke ‘because’
(from Spanish porque); maske ‘although’ (from Spanish más que ‘more than’); and ni ‘neither,
nor’ (from Spanish ni). Other borrowed basic function-like words include mas ‘more’ (from
Spanish más); mejor ‘better’ (from Spanish mejor); and peor ‘bad’ (from Spanish peor ‘worse’).
These are all discussed in 10.2 and 9.4.
       Because the Catholic missionaries were the only people speaking Spanish in Sibundoy
until the 1950s (Fabre 2001:2), much of the older Spanish vocabulary that has been borrowed
into Kamsá reflects the varieties of Spanish used by the them. Fabre states: “This explains why
the Spanish layer we can detect in Kamsá and Inga is so replete with quaintly old-fashioned
church Spanish” (Fabre 2001:2). Some examples are the following: parla ‘speak’ (from parlar, a
now obsolete Spanish word for ‘speak’, cf. standard hablar); ndeombre ‘truly’ (from Spanish de
hombre loosely, ‘by my word’); andela warda ‘God protect you’ (from Spanish dios le guarde,
‘God preserve you’), dioslepay ‘thank you’ (from (que) dios le pague ‘may God pay you’, cf.
standard gracias).
       Along with vocabulary, Kamsá has borrowed some phonology from Spanish as well
(2.2.2.7). The most obvious loan phoneme is /r/, some examples of which were seen above.
Other examples include rat ‘bit, while’ (from Spanish rato ‘while’) and mor ‘now’ (from
Spanish ahora ‘now’ or, alternatively, from *mwa-hora ‘this hour’, from Kamsá mwa ‘that’ plus
Spanish hora ‘hour’).
       Kamsá’s traditional phoneme inventory also lacked a plain (non-prenasalized) voiced
alveolar /d/, and many older Spanish words that contained /d/ have been borrowed into Kamsá
with either /nd/ or /ndʒ/ (written in orthography used here as <nd> and <nÿ>, respectively).
Examples of Spanish words with *d that have been borrowed with phonological changes into
                                                 13
Kamsá are: nÿios or ndios or nÿios̈ ‘god’ (from Spanish dios ‘god’); ndeolpe ‘suddenly’ from de
golpe ‘suddenly’; and nderado ‘maybe’ possibly from *de raro.
       Many words borrowed from Spanish have changed in meaning, sometimes even
functioning as different parts of speech in Kamsá than in Spanish. Loanwords are pointed out
throughout the dissertation as well as their change in meaning and/or part of speech. Two brief
examples of loanwords that have taken on new meaning in Kamsá are ora ‘when’ and parej
‘with’. First, ora ‘when’ comes from the Spanish nouns hora ‘hour, time, when’, but has become
a subordinator for temporal clauses, thus shifting both in meaning and in function (10.3.3).
Similarly, parej ‘with’ from the Spanish adjective parejo ‘equal to, level with, similar to’
functions in Kamsá as a preposition, not as a adjective.
       Many Spanish words have found new meanings in ceremonial speech, the register of
Kamsá that is used for many formal situations, such as greetings in the cabildo, and for Catholic
sacraments, such as baptisms and confirmations. Haydee Seijas (1969:65), who conducted
anthropological fieldwork in Sibundoy in the 1960s, refers to this type of speech as the lengua de
los antiguos or “relación speech”. She reports that most people are not fluent in this speech,
which consists of set words and phrases and are used by the governor in his Sunday address to
the Kamsá people and by others as a means of showing politeness. The following example, the
beginning of a formal greeting, shows the Spanish influence, with three out of the four words
coming from Spanish (the possessive pronoun ats̈be ‘my’ is the only fully native Kamsá word).
The verb, although derived from Spanish, exhibits Kamsá verbal morphology:(1)    Primermente ats̈be dios chas̈pasentsia …
       primermente ats̈-be            dios cha-s̈-pasentsia
       first             1SG-GEN      god    COND-1SG-forgive
       ‘First may god forgive me…’ (Chindoy 28:5) (primermente from Spanish primeramente
       ‘firstly’, dios from Spanish dios ‘God’, pasentsia from Spanish paciencia ‘patience’)       Much of the ‘formal’ speech relates to the Catholic church, which we might expect to
have a lot of Spanish not because it’s formal but because it involves Catholic rituals and
ceremonies, where they borrowed the words along with the rituals. There is also non-religious
formal speech that uses Spanish, such as the petitioning for a girlfriend, mentioned above.
       In addition to lexical borrowing, Kamsá has perhaps undergone structural changes under
influence from Spanish and Inga. Since Kamsá has no known relatives and since no early                                                 14
documents representing the language are known, it is impossible to say with any certainty what
structural traits (if any) are due to influence from other languages. That said, it is possible that
the basic word order in Kamsá is becoming more SVO (due to influence from Spanish), and that
there is a trend toward using fewer adjectival verbs or null-copular constructions for predicate
adjectives, with a preference instead for copula-plus-adjective constructions (as in Spanish).
Fabre (Fabre 2001:3) suggests another influence from Spanish:   the redundant use of the same classifier, even with no intervening word between them,
   strongly reminds of the Spanish number and gender agreement rules between the same two
   parts of speech and sets Kamsá apart from classifier languages of Western Amazonia, where
   classifiers are mostly used as an anaphoric device, there being no need of repeating the noun
   to which they refer.","[25, 26, 27, 28]"

                                        Verbal morphology
4.1    Introduction
       Kamsá verbs exhibit intricate morphology, with multiple prefixes and suffixes that index
person and number for subjects and objects and indicate tense, aspect, mood, and evidentiality
for events and states. This introduction summarizes the important phenomena of Kamsá verbal
morphology discussed in more detail in the following sections.
       Kamsá verbs reflect a nominative-accusative morphosyntactic alignment: the person
marking for the single argument (the subject) of an intransitive verb matches the person marking
for the more agentive argument (the subject) of a transitive verb, whereas the marking for the
more patientive argument (the object) is different. Subject marking is obligatory in Kamsá, as is
object marking for first and second person objects.
       In verbs that do not exhibit any object marking, the first verbal prefix is usually a subject
marker, with all other prefixes following this prefix and preceding the stem. There are some
exceptions, however, such as the emphatic prefix kwa- and the perfective marker t-, both of
which may precede the subject prefix. When a transitive verb exhibits overt object marking (that
is, in verbs with first or second person objects), the object marker is the first prefix on the verb,
followed by the subject marker, and then followed by all other prefixes and the stem.
       This introductory section summarizes the different morphemes that Kamsá verbs can
have, all of which are discussed in more depth in the rest of this chapter.
       A verb consists minimally either of a root plus inflectional morphology or a root with the
prefix j- and the suffix -an or -am. A root can never appear alone. Some examples of verb roots
are the following. The elicitation forms always have j- and -an, thus I write them as such here.
As seen in these examples, verb roots can start with /a/, /o/, or /w/.       j-abwamiy-an ‘buy’
       j-achway-an ‘greet’
       j-alants-an ‘dance’
       j-amn-an ‘be’
       j-as-an ‘eat’
       j-ayan-an ‘say’                                                  87
       j-otbem-an ‘sit’
       j-owen-an ‘hear’
       j-oyebwambay-an ‘speak’
       j-wabw-an ‘cook’
       j-wabwem-an ‘write’
       j-washaby-an ‘wash clothes’       While all person (subject and object) and TAME (tense, aspect, mood, evidentiality)
prefixes precede the root, there are a few suffixes that can appear on a root as well. Some
prefixes are portmanteau, simultaneously encoding multiple grammatical categories, such as both
person and tense or both tense and aspect. All inflected verbs are marked for both person and
number.
       Verbs also exhibit TAM marking. There are many prefixes that combine with each other
for different tenses and aspects. In this chapter, I discuss all of the various morphemes that can
occur on verbs. First, I discuss person and number subject marking (4.2) then person and number
for object marking (4.3). In 4.4, I discuss the different tense, aspect, mood, and negation
prefixes. In 4.5, I discuss evidentiality, followed by reciprocal marking in 4.6. In 4.7, I discuss
the imperative form m-, and in 4.8 I show the intensifying prefix kwa-. The last sections are
dedicated to suffixes.","[99, 100, 101]"

        Pronouns can also serve as objects in a verb phrase. They are not marked any differently
from full NP direct objects. In (22a). the object is ats̈ ‘1SG’. Note that the verb agrees with ats̈ in
person and number. The noun ndëts̈-be ‘rock’ is marked with an instrumental case marker. In
(2b), the subject is the first person singular pronoun ats̈. When comparing of (22b) in which ats̈
‘1SG’ is the subject of a transitive clause with (22a) in which ats̈ ‘1SG’ is the object, it can be
seen that the form of the pronoun is the same regardless of whether it is serving as subject or as
object. In (22c), ats̈ ‘1SG’ is the subject of the sentence and has the topic marker -na. When a
pronoun is the direct object of a verb, it does not have to be expressed, as seen in example (20b)
above, in which the verbal prefix k- ‘2SG’ shows that the object is second person singular.(22a) Ch basatem ats̈ s̈onjapega base ndëts̈bemak.

      ‘You run fast and I will follow you.’ (i < Spanish y ‘and’) (Chindoy2 154:3)        Some other parts of speech can also serve as objects within VPs. In (23), the
demonstrative mwa is the object of the imperative form of the verb jolempia ‘clean’ (from
Spanish limpiar ‘clean’) and the numeral kanÿe ‘one’ is the object of the verb jasan ‘eat’.","[217, 218]"

5.2     Independent pronouns
        Kamsá has nine personal pronouns for subject/object. As with nouns, there is no
morphological difference for pronouns that would depend on whether they function as the
subject of an intransitive sentence, the subject of a transitive sentence, or a direct object. They
mostly behave as nouns do in the language. They take case markers, and sometimes evaluatives.
Like nouns, they do not seem to take class markers when they are referring to a noun with class
markers. this section does not discuss pronominal affixes (e.g. pronominal agreement markers on
verbs). Kamsá is a prodrop language. Person and number is marked by agreement affixes on the
verb, both for subjects and objects, and the pronoun is not necessary.",[149]
"
14: Both subject and object can be encoded on verb:
       “Some Andean languages encode both the subject and an object in a verb form” (Adelaar
2008:29).
       Kamsá encodes both subject and object on the verb.",[45]

        First person singular subject and second person object is shown on the verb as k-bo-, with
k- marking the object and bo- marking the subject. Note that the first person singular subject                                                 106
marker is usually së- whereas bo- is the dual marker. Thus, when the object is second person, the
first person subject marker changes to bo-, which is also the dual marker.
       An alternative analysis is that it is k-b-o- and with o- marking transitivity.
       In the following examples, the subject is first person singular and the object is second
person singular. The prefix for the second person object k- is the first prefix on the verb,
followed by bo- which here marks first person singular.
       In (23a) ‘I am looking at you’ there are no independent subject or object pronouns in the
clause, but k- marks the second person object and bo- marks the first person subject. In (23b) the
dual marker bo- is shown for comparison; the verb jochashjajwa ‘rest on a patio’ (from chashjan
‘patio’) has the dual marker bo- to agree with the subject (which is not expressed), a couple.
        In (23c), the object is also shown by the overt independent pronoun ak ‘you singular’.
Note that there is no difference between subject and object independent pronouns; ak is the
second singular pronoun, both for subjects and objects. In (23d), the sentence is the same as
(23c) but without the second person singular independent pronoun ak. In (23e) the verb is in the
future, which is zero marked in the first person singular when there is not an object marker as
seen in (23f) for comparison, where the verb jan ‘go’ is first person singular future, with the first
person singular marking null and an oblique ak-abtak ‘with you’. (23g) provides another
example of the first person singular subject and second person plural object in the future. Note
that j-wasta-n ‘follow, accompany’ j-wakmeya-n ‘follow, chase’ are transitive, whereas jan ‘go’
is not. Thus in (23f) the second person ak ‘you’ is in an oblique role and not marked on the verb,
whereas in (23e) and (23g) the second person is marked on the verb with k-.(23a) kbontsonÿa

        When the subject is second person singular, and the object is first person singular, the

the second person subject marker ko-. (25b) shows the same ordering, with both the first person
object marker s̈- and the second person subject marker ko- preceding the evidential marker n-
and the progressive marker ts-. In (25c) it is the same, but the object, the first person singular
pronoun ats̈ is in the clause. Note that when there is a first person subject with a second person
object, the subject marker on the verb is dual, whereas when there is a second person subject
with a first person object, it is simply the second person singular subject marker, not dual.(25a) s̈koyengwango

        When a verb has a third person plural subject and a first-person singular object, the verb
has the prefixes s̈- for first person object and mo- for third person subject. In (31a) the verb j-
akmen ‘chase’ has the prefixes s̈- and mo- to mean ‘they chase me’. In (31b) the verb has two
objects, the first person singular and pavor ‘favor’.
        This combination is identical to the prefix for second person singular subject s̈mo- and to
the morphemes for first person object and imperative, s̈- and mo- respectively, and to the
combination of first person singular object and second person plural subject s̈- and s̈mo-, which
become s̈mo- (not s̈s̈mo- or s̈ës̈mo-, which can be explained by a phonological rule that doesn’t
allow s̈ and s̈ next to each other. ).(31a) s̈mojtsakmen

7.2     Adverbs
        Adverbs in Kamsá can modify verbs, adjectives and other adverbs. They have no
inflection, neither nominal inflection nor verbal inflection. There are not many adverbs in the
language, although adjectives can be used adverbially. Many adverbs are derived from Spanish.
Temporal and locative adverbs generally come first in a clause, only preceded by conjunctions
and certain particles. Manner adverbs can occur in different places in a clause. In general, it
seems that adverbs come at the beginning of VPs. They can precede or follow subjects; they
generally precede objects; and they almost always precede verbs.",[172]
"
3.2    Noun classes
       Kamsá has a system that falls between noun class and noun classifier, typologically,
fitting neither definition neatly. Here I choose the term class because the markers are an
obligatory part of the noun. Kamsá does not have grammatical gender, but there are at least 10
class markers that exist in the language, as well as a subset of nouns in which the noun itself is a
suffix, often called a ‘repeater’ in other South American languages. The class markers are bound
morphemes; they are suffixes which form a phonological word with their host and cannot be
removed or changed. Demonstratives, adjectives, and sometimes numerals which agree with the
noun have a matching suffix, depending on the position of the demonstrative, adjective, or
numeral in relation to the noun. A few classes are signaled by both a prefix and a suffix, but no
classes are signaled by a prefix without a suffix.
       The majority of nouns in Kamsá do not belong to a noun class; the nouns with class
markers are a very small subset of the nouns in the language. The majority of nouns have no
special suffix and the adjectives, demonstratives, or numerals which agree with them do not take
a special suffix, either. Although some noun classes have something semantic in common, such
as signifying that the objects are round or hairy, many do not fall into a particular semantic
domain, and for some classes, I have not found enough nouns to determine what if any the
semantic relationship for the nouns could be.
       After showing that most nouns do not belong to the class of nouns that require a class
marker, I show 11 noun classes and one additional suspect noun class. For each category, I give
an example of the noun with an adjective, where possible with the adjective bchenda ‘blue’.
Then, I give other examples of other nouns in the class. Finally, for each category I offer an
explanation of what could connect them semantically. Where possible, I include both native
Kamsá words and loanwords from Spanish that belong to the class. The loan words that have
class markers may lend additional insight into the semantic domain of these noun classes because
they are more recent additions to the class. I start with the the unmarked noun class giving
examples of a human, an object, a place, and an abstract thing, to show that there is no class or                                                 55
gender for these words, the majority of words in the language. There is no morphological
difference in the root between animate and inanimate nouns, or between human and nonhuman
nouns. Again, it is important to emphasize that most nouns in Kamsá do NOT have any class
marker, while there are some very specific groups of nouns that do have special noun-class
suffixes.","[68, 69]"
"
3.3.3.1 Unmarked case
       In Kamsá, A, S, and O do not have any overt case marking. The noun stem appears alone
without any affixes. Furthermore, in ditransitives, neither the O or the Goal has any marking.
       In (33a) the A (agent) batá ‘aunt’ has no suffix. In (33b) batá is the P (direct object) and
has no suffix. In (33c) batá ‘aunt’ is the S (subject of the intransitive sentence) and has no affix.
Finally, in (33d), batá is a recipient object of the ditransitive verb and has no case-marking
suffix. Note that the other object sana ‘food’ also has no case marking.",[85]
"
4.2    Person and number: subject marking
       Verbs can be marked to index both subjects and objects. This section illustrates the
subject marker morphology on verbs that indexes the person and/or number of the referent. The
subject marker is usually the first prefix on the verb, farthest from the stem, although there are a
few prefixes that can precede it, such as the prefix kwa- ‘truly’, discussed in 4.8.
       Figure 4.1 (on the following page) shows the different verbal prefixes that mark the
person and number of the subject. In the table, I include the pronouns for each person/number.
These prefixes typically precede the TAM markers. For some tenses/aspects, the person marker
is different, as discussed below.",[101]

       Causatives are formed morphologically. They are formed by adding the object pronoun
prefix to the verb. A causative meaning is formed by putting an object pronoun marker on the
verb, thus, increasing valency, going from ‘she cried’ vs. ‘she cried me’ = increase valency of
‘cry’ by 1, meaning it now takes a direct object, and therefore, since ‘cry’ is semantically
inherently intransitive, with the object the sense is a verb with both a subject and an object,
hence causative. As far as I know, there is no analytic version, i.e. no multiword construction
like ‘make someone do something’ composed of some independent ‘make’-like auxiliary or verb
plus another verb. In (28a) there is an intransitive sentence with the verb j-os̈achn ‘cry’. It is
marked with to- to show past and third singular subject. In causative (28b) j-os̈achn ‘cry’is
marked with the direct object pronominal prefix s̈o-. In (28c) the verb is marked with the dual
bo-. In (28d) only the first person subject is marked with te-, an alternate past form for the first
person singular. The function of j- is unclear. In (28c) the bo- shows that there is an animate
subject and an animate object, while in (28d) the verbal prefix (28d) just marks first person
singular subject and past tense. In (28e-f) a causative with a transitive verb jasan ‘eat’ is shown.","[269, 270]"

      ‘You (plural) are crying out for corn.’ (Chindoy 2 73:2)It is important to note that s̈mo- is confusingly the same morpheme as the composite for a first
person object s̈- and third person plural agent mo-. Thus, ‘you all are screaming’ and ‘they are
screaming at me’ would both have s̈mo-.
        This is discussed further below, but for now these morphemes are summarized below:Second person plural subject: s̈mo-
First person object: s̈-
Third person subject: mo-
First person object + third person subject = s̈mo-4.2.6   Third person plural: mo-
        Third person plural subjects are indexed on verbs by the plural prefix mo-. Each of the
verbs in (13) has a plural subject and is marked with mo-. In (13a), the subject, shloftstemang
‘little birds’, is overt in the clause, whereas in (13b) and (13c), the subjects are not expressed, but
are understood to be third person plural referents due to the verbal morphology. In (13d) the third
person plural pronoun chëng is used.(13a) Chents̈ shlobs̈etemang motsomën.

        There is no specific verbal marker to indicate first person dual subjects. That is, no prefix
encodes both first person and dual number. First person dual subjects can be indexed with the
dual marker bo-, the first person marker së-, and bsë-. It is possible that such subjects can
alternatively be marked with the plural marker mo-, but I do not have examples of mo- marking
first person dual in my data.
        In (14a), the verb j-wabw-an ‘cook’ is marked with the dual marker bo-, agreeing with
the first dual pronoun bëndat in the same clause. In (14b), the two verbs jashjango ‘arrive’ and
jatay ‘spend the night’ are marked with the dual marker bo-. Here, there is no overt subject, but
the subject is understood to be first person (dual) since the sentence belongs to a text in which a
man is planning with his brother. In (14c), the verb jan ‘go’ is marked with së-, the first person
marker. Here, the subject of the verb is overtly expressed and seen to be dual: is ats̈ i ats̈be bemb
‘my daughter and I’. In (14d), there is the prefix bs- for a dual subject.(14a) Kadaté bëndat bondwabwán wameshnen.

        Second person dual has the marker s̈o-, but it can also be indexed with the dual marker
bo-. It is possible that such subjects can alternatively be marked with the plural marker mo- or
the second person plural marker s̈mo- but I do not have examples of these in my corpus. In (15a),
both verbs are marked with s̈o- to agree with the second person dual subject pronoun tsëndat.
Also in (15b) the verb j-aman ‘sleep’ is marked with s̈o- to agree with tsëndat, whereas in (15c)
the verb is marked simply with the dual marker bo-, which does not index person. Note that in
(15a) the verb also has a dual suffix -at in addition to the second person dual prefix.(15a) Tsëndata kats̈ata s̈ondmëna,

first person singular object ats̈ ‘I, me’. Object marking is discussed in 4.3.","[110, 111, 112, 113]"

                                             Adjectives
6.1    Introduction
       Adjectives in Kamsá are an open class of words. I define them as being words that can
agree with nouns in class, number, and sometimes evaluatives and/or case; that can be
intensified; and can take comparative degrees. Their typical functions are to modify
nouns/nominals (attributive adjectives, e.g. the big dog) and as adjectival predicate complements
(e.g. the dog is big). Their defining criteria in my analysis is their ability agree with nouns
because nouns cannot agree with other nouns.
       An adjective can agree with a noun that it modifies in class, number, and evaluative
marking. Adjectives often take the case marker for a noun phrase, and they can sometimes agree
with a noun in case. Adjectives can be intensified with adverbs such as bien ‘very’ and yap
‘very, much’. Adjectives can also take comparatives.
       The following examples show the morphology that adjectives have when agreeing with
nouns. This chapter discusses this morphology in greater depth. In (1b) the adjective bwangan
‘red’ agrees with chembalbe ‘tree tomato’ with the class marker -be. In (1c) bwangan ‘red’
agrees with the plural noun s̈lofts̈ëng with the plural marker -ang. In (1d) stjnëj ‘hair’ has the
diminutive marker -tem, as does the adjective ftseng ‘black’ that agrees with it. In (1e) both the
noun chembalbe ‘tree tomato’ and bochan ‘ripe’ have the instrumental case marker -k. In
addition, the adjective bochan agrees with chembal-be in class, as shown by the suffix -be. In
(1f) the adjective is intensified with yap. Finally, in (1g) an adjective is used in a comparative
construction with mas ‘more’. These qualities of adjectives are discussed further in the following
sections of this chapter.(1a)   bwangan ‘red’(1b)   chembalbe indemun bwanganbe

       Adjectives tend to end in /a/, /o/, or /á/. Adjectives that end in /o/ or /a/ lose this final
vowel when they precede the noun, but adjectives ending in the stressed vowel /á/ do not lose the
final vowel. In Figure 6.1 botamana ‘beautiful’ is botamán when preceding a noun and
botamana when following the noun or standing alone after the verb. i-nd-emën is the third
singular present form of j-amnan ‘be’.botamán tobias̈                                      ‘beautiful girl’
tobias̈ botamana                                     ‘beautiful girl’
tobias̈ indemën botamana                             ‘(the) girl is beautiful’
tobias̈ botamana indemën                             ‘(the) girl is beautiful’                                  Figure 6.1 Noun/adjective order       Likewise, adjectives that end in /o/ lose the /o/ when they precedes the noun. betsko ’fast’
can be betsk and podesko ’ugly’ can be podesk when preceding a noun. Adjectives that end in
                                                 151
stressed /á/ cannot lose the vowel regardless of the position of the adjective. ‘Fat dog’ can be
either oboná kes̈ (fat dog) or kes̈ oboná (dog fat), but not *obon kes̈.
       Figure 6.2 shows some common adjectives in the language.","[162, 163, 164, 165]"

        ndoñ usually goes directly before the verb, as in most of the examples above. It tends to
go at the beginning of the verb phrase. Objects come after ndoñ and before the verb, as seen in
(14a) where tsës̈ey ‘yellow’ is the object of the verb. Note that tsës̈ey has the class marker -be for
round things to agree with egg, which is implied by the verb. In (14b) the adjective bëts ‘big’
precedes the verb, with ndoñ preceding it. In (14c) ndoñ precedes the adverb bien ‘well’ and in
(14d) ndoñ precedes the adverb chka ‘like that’. Although ndoñ usually comes before the verb
phrase, it can follow the verb as well, as seen in (14e). In (14f), there is a common expression,
with ndoñ at the end of the phrase.(14a) ndoñ tsës̈eybe yenjoshma

        but    now NEG
        ‘But now, no/not anymore.’9.4     Comparatives and superlatives
        Comparatives are formed with mas (from Spanish más ‘more’) followed the adjective.
The word being compared is marked with the benefactive -am for inanimate nouns and -byam for
animate nouns. Comparatives for phrases are similarly formed with mas and the phrase. There
are no irregular comparatives; all comparatives are formed with mas + adjective. One interesting
phenomenon, however, is that for better sometimes the language uses mas + ts̈aba ‘good’ and
sometimes mas + mejor. Similarly, worse is often mas + peor. Superlatives are formed with mas
and the adjective. The noun has no special marking.
        In (15a) the adjective bna ‘tall’ is preceded by mas and tobias̈ ‘girl’ is marked with the
benefactive byam, while bobonts ‘young man’ is not marked. In (15b) wamaná ‘above’ is
preceded by mas and bwatëmbaya ‘teacher’ is marked with the benefactive biam. In the second
part of (15b) wamaná ‘above’ is preceded by mas and ndwiñ ‘owner’ (from Spanish dueño) is
marked with benefactive -byam. In (15c), there is a phrase being compared, obenana bomná                                                226
‘power-having’. In all examples, mas precedes the adjective. In (15d) más ‘more’ and ts̈abá
‘good’ mean ‘better’.(15a) ch bobonts ya mas bna ch tobias̈byam

in (17a) on j-ashjango ‘arrive’ and (17b) with jamnan ‘be’. It is possible that third person dual

ashjango ‘arrive’ to agree with the null subject (two brothers). The same prefix is on the verb j-

the allative marker -bioy. There are two possible analyses for this. The first is homophony: bo-

        In (55a) yo- is on the verb jenÿenan ‘find’. Other morphology on the verb is different, as
well. The meaning seems to be passive. Although yo- can be a distant past marker, here it is not,
because it is found in dialogue. The other examples are even less clearly passive. In (55b), it is
on the verb j-opodenan ‘be able’ (from Spanish poder ‘be able’). Note that there is a native
Kamsa word for ‘be able’, as well, and it is possible that this word has a slightly different
meaning. In (55c), the verb could be distant past, with yo- marking distant past, or it could be a
different construction. In (55d), the subject is plural, and the verb is j-onan ‘feel’.(55a) Ats̈ sëndenÿena ndayents̈e ch matse yobinÿana.

         There is a two-way evidentiality system: n- for known information and j- or Ø- for
unknown information. More research is needed to determine if the form of the unknown
evidential marker is j- or Ø- because it always appears with verbalizer j- and thus could be j- + j-
. The evidential marker comes after the person markers and before the aspect markers. There are
several morphophonemic rules with these evidential markers, discussed below.
         The marker for something known is n-. It is often used in the recent past, and never used
in the distant past11. It is almost always used in first person singular (not necessarily plural,
because first person plural could mean ‘we, the Kamsás’).
         The marker for something not known is j- or Ø-. Jamioy Muchavisoy describes the
evidential system as being n- for ‘close’ and j-12 for removed (1999). In (56a), the j- shows that
the speaker is has distance from responsibility, while in (56b) the speaker is closer.","[140, 141]"

friend. In (34b), a noun that ends with a consonant is show: bobonts ‘young man’ is bobonts-be

can be used for possession by a definite noun, as seen above in (34a), where it is about a
particular aunt. Nouns that are not definite or specific can also be possessed as seen in (35)
where the speaker is talking about a sound that sounds like the scream of a human or a bark of a
dog.",[86]

suffixes; or singular marking person prefixes with plural or dual marking suffixes. For plural and
dual, person can be encoded, or number, or both. Whether the person and/or number is encoded
depends partially on pragmatics (i.e. if the overt pronoun is used or not). The first person plural
marker is bs-, but verbs that have first person plural subjects will often exhibit the first person
markers së- or Ø- instead, or the plural marker mo-. The second person plural marker is s̈m-, but
second person plural subjects can instead be marked with the second person prefix ko- or the
plural prefix mo-. The third person plural marker is always mo-. Similarly, dual subjects may or
may not be specified. Verbs with dual subjects can be marked specifically as dual with the prefix
bo- (regardless of person). Alternatively, verbs can index only the person (and not the number)
of dual subjects (së- or Ø- for first person, s̈m- or ko- for second person, but generally not i-, Ø-,
to-, or ye- for third person). Finally, dual subject referents can be indexed with the plural marker
mo-. There is no marker that encodes first person dual (as opposed to dual in other persons, or
first person in other numbers) or second person dual (as opposed to dual in other persons, or
second person in other numbers. In sum, verbs may employ a precise prefix to encode both
person and number or a less specified prefix that encodes the number but not the person of the
subject or one that encodes the person but not the number of the subject.
       In addition to the set of prefixes that can encode both the person and number of the
subject, there are two number suffixes that can be added to verbs to index the (non-singular)
number of the subject: -ang for plural and -at for dual. These suffixes are the same as those that
occur on nouns, pronouns, and adjectives. In sum, there are several options for marking non-
singular: with simply plural or dual marking person prefixes; with plural or dual marking person
prefixes in addition to plural or dual marking suffixes; or singular marking person prefixes with
plural or dual marking suffixes. To determine the difference in meaning, more research is
needed. Pragmatically, these suffixes are often used when the prefix is marked only for person,
not number, and/or when the subject pronoun or noun is not overt in the clause. These suffixes
are also shown in Table 4.1.
       The person and number markers are discussed for the remainder of 4.2. It is not
exhaustive, however; person/number marking can differ in other tenses/moods.","[102, 103]"

        All verbs can have non-finite verbs as complements. These non-finite-verb complements
are not inflected for person or number, and often they have the suffix -n (this latter suffix appears                                                208
on citation forms of verbs) or the suffix -m (which is of the same form as the benefactive marker
that appears on nouns). When the verb has the suffix -m it often shows purpose. In (31a), the
verb yejonts̈á ‘begin’ is inflected for third person singular distant past and has the complement
japarlan ‘to tell’ (derived from Spanish parlar ‘to talk’). The complement japarlan has the
suffix -n.
        In (31b) and (31c) the uninflected verbs show purpose and have the suffix -m, which is
the same as the benefactive clitic for nouns. In (31b) the verb japroba is inflected to index a third
person singular subject and contains a complement jonguefjwan ‘to fly’, which contains its own
complement, jtsacha-m ‘to escape’. In (31c), the verb bojas̈bwachen ‘agree’ is inflected for
person and TAM with the third person dual past prefix bo- and has the complement jwashëntsam
‘to plant corn’. In (31d) the noun shajwan ‘fruit’ has the benefactive marker -m.(31a) As mënts̈á yejonts̈á japarlan:

object tends to precede the complement verb, both when the object is a noun (32a) and when it is
a pronoun (32b). This is not always the case, however, as seen in (32c), where the object soy
‘thing’ precedes the subject, main verb, and complement verb. Also note that the verbal
complement jatrabajan ‘work’ precedes the modal verb jobenan ‘be able’.","[221, 222]"

                                            4
       In addition to the Kamsá populations within Sibundoy Valley, there are four Kamsá
resguardos ‘reservations’: two just outside Sibundoy town and two near Mocoa. Most Kamsás,
however, do not live on resguardos, but rather live in their own houses in veredas (rural areas
outside a city or town). Furthermore, there are also Kamsás who live in other cities in Colombia.
The Colombian towns and cities with Kamsá cabildos ‘indigenous governing bodies’ (discussed
further in 1.2.2) are: Bogotá, Puerto Asís, Mocoa, and Santiago. There are perhaps 100 Kamsá
families living in Bogotá. Some were forcibly displaced during the Colombian conflict and
others have moved there to seek other opportunities for work, education, and so on.
       Sibundoy Valley is also home to another linguistic and ethnic group, the Ingas, who
traditionally speak Inga (ISO 639-3 inb, Glottocode inga1252), which belongs to the Quechuan
family (it is sometimes referred to as Highland Inga in the literature). The Kamsás and the Ingas
have shared this valley since perhaps the 15th century, the assumption being that the Kamsás had
inhabited the region first. There are several theories about how Inga came to be spoken in the
valley. One theory is that, when the Inca empire conquered the area in the 15 th century, some of
the local inhabitants (perhaps themselves Kamsá speakers) adopted the language of the Incas.
The current Inga language would thus represent the result of whatever diachronic changes
occurred to the earlier Quechuan language of the Inca over the past five-hundred or so years.
Another theory has it that Catholic missionaries brought Quechua as a lingua franca to use with
the natives (Seijas 1969) and thus the local indigenous people of many groups began to speak
what became today’s Inga. This is suggested by records of missionaries writing to one another to
tell each other to use Inga in southern Colombia. In the past, most Kamsás and Ingas spoke each
other’s languages, but with the growing influence of Spanish, this is increasingly less the case.
Inga is a larger language, with about 18,000 speakers in Colombia, at least according to
Ethnologue (Simons & Fennig 2018, citing Civallero 2008). (Although other sources, however,
say there are 8,000 speakers or fewer). The influences of Inga are apparent in the lexicon; Kamsá
has borrowed many words from its neighbor, as well as from Spanish.
       While it is assumed that the Kamsá people have had a presence in Sibundoy since before
arrival or emergence of Inga speakers, it is not clear exactly how long they have been there,
partially because the archaeological evidence is lacking. There are theories that they came from
the north (that is, from other highland groups) and other theories that they came from the south
(from lowland groups). The traditional Kamsá belief is that they are autochthonous, having                                                 5
always been in Sibundoy and indeed there is no strong evidence that they came from the north or
the south. They may have lived alone in the valley for many centuries without any particularly
strong outside contact. As mentioned, there have been Inga people living in the valley for at least
the past 500 years, though. In the 15th century, the Inca empire was very powerful to the south,
but it is actually debated whether the Incas actually conquered Sibundoy valley.
           The Spanish came in 1534 and established the town of Sibundoy. Although they had a
strong administrative presence, they were unable to erase the culture of the Kamsá. This was due
to no lack of effort on the part of the Spanish. Wade Davis (1996:171) writes:           More than a century after the arrival of the missionaries, the Franciscan bishop
           Peña Montenegro, frustrated by the persistence of traditional beliefs, noted that
           ‘this evil seed planted such deep roots in the Indians that it appeared to become
           their very flesh and blood so that their descendants acquired the same beings as
           their parents, inherited in the same blood and stamped on their souls.’           In his book about the missionization of the natives of Sibundoy, Bonilla (1972:14) notes,
however, that the missionaries were, in a sense, successful, because the Indians there at the time
(the Kamsás and Ingas) ultimately syncretized their religion with Catholicism, identifying their
“Sun God with the God Father, and the Moon and Earth goddesses with the Virgin Mary 1”. In
1767, the Franciscans were expelled from all of Colombia and so the area of Putumayo had less
contact with the outside world for about the next century. At the end of the 19 th century,
however, the Capuchins, a Franciscan order, arrived in southern Colombia and, in 1899 or 1900,
the Colombian government gave the Capuchins complete control over the Amazon to evangelize
the natives. They established their base for the Amazon in Sibundoy, and “they ran a colonial
theocracy unlike anything seen in the Americas since the heyday of the Jesuits. Their power was
absolute.” (Davis 1996:171). They essentially enslaved much of the native population. They built
a road connecting Putumayo to Pasto, and thus to the rest of Colombia, using the labor of the
Kamsás and Ingas.","[17, 18, 19]"

the TAM prefix) for the past, habitual, and progressive forms, and Ø- (followed by the TAM
prefix) for the future and conditional forms. The second person singular prefix is ko- for all TAM
distinctions. The third person singular prefix exhibits a number of forms depending on tense
distinctions: i- for progressive and future; Ø-, occasionally, for habitual (discussed below); to-
for past; and ye- or yo- for distant past. Finally, the third person singular prefix can also be bo-
(which is the same as the dual prefix 5); this is the case usually only if the clause is transitive and
both the agent and patient are animate. It is important to note that in the future tense, first person
subjects are zero-marked, whereas in other tenses third person subjects are zero-marked.
         There are several options for marking non-singular: with simply plural or dual marking
person prefixes; with plural or dual marking person prefixes in addition to plural or dual marking
5
 It is not clear if the bo- used on transitive verbs when both the subject and object are transitive is the same as the
bo- used on verbs with dual subjects.","[101, 102]"

8.3.3   VPs with obliques
        Verb phrases can also contain obliques—that is, NPs that are marked with case-marked
suffixes but do not play the role of core arguments (subject, object, or object of a distransitive) of
the verb. In (24a) bobonts ‘young man’ bears the allative marker -bioy. In (24b), ndweñang
‘owners’ has the benefactive marker. (Note that ndweñ ‘owner’ is from Spanish dueño ‘owner’;
the initial alveolar stop is prenasalized, following the phonology of Kamsá, imposed by some
speakers on Spanish loan words as well). In (24c), bata ‘aunt’ has the locative marker -bioka.
None of these verb phrases has an expressed direct object.(24a) Ch kaserna bojatjay bobontsbioy:

jajan ‘chagra (small farm)’ marked as locative (jajan loses the final n and becomes jaja + -ok,
then jajok) and taita ‘father’ marked as comitative.","[218, 219]"

4.2.3   Third person singular: i- or ton-
        Third person singular subjects are indexed on the verb with the vowel i- in the present,
future, and distant past tenses and to- in the past tense. (There is yet another form for the third
person singular distant past: ye-. The difference between the distant past with i- and the distant
past with ye- is as yet undetermined and is discussed further in 4.4.7). Finally, when a transitive
verb has a third person singular subject and a first or second person (singular, plural, or dual)
object, the subject is not marked; only the object is marked. Phonetically, the i- for third person
singular habitual is often reduced to [ë].
        In (6a) and (6b), the tense/aspect of the verb is present/habitual and the subject is a third
person singular referent. In (6a), the subject is cha, the third person singular pronoun. In (6b), the
subject is kes̈ ‘dog’, In (6c), the verb j-wabwan ‘cook’ has the future marker chan- with the third
person singular marker i- preceding chan- and indexing a third person singular (pronominal)
subject.(6a)    Kadaté cha indwabwán wameshnen.

                                       Phrase-level syntax
8.1    Introduction
       This chapter discusses phrase-level syntax in Kamsá. A phrase may be considered a set of
one or more words functioning together as a syntactic unit, a unit usually smaller than (or a
constituent of) a clause. A phrase consists minimally of a single word, but more often contains
multiple words. In Kamsá, there are noun phrases (8.2), verb phrases, (8.3), postpositional
phrases (9.4), and prepositional phrases (8.5). Although prepositional phrases only occur with
Spanish loan words, they are very common in the language. There are some phrase-level clitics,
including the topic marker =na which occurs at the end of a noun phrase (8.2.3.2) and case
marking clitics at the end of noun phrases (8.2.3.1). Case marking is discussed further in (3.3.3).","[203, 204, 205, 206]"

        Spanish patrón ‘owner’); kots̈ < Spanish coche ‘pig’)8.4     Postpositional phrases
        Postpositional phrases in Kamsá consist of a noun followed by a postposition. Often case
markers are also present: case markers can occur on the postposition itself, on the noun, or on
both the postposition and the noun. In (34a), the postposition tsëntsa ‘middle’ follows the noun
tsa ‘room’ and tsëntsa has the locative marker -k. Similarly, in (34b) tsëntsa has the case marker
                                               210
-k and the NP preceding it, chëng ‘3PL’, has the genitive marker -be. In (34c) the third person
singular pronoun cha has the genitive marker -be when it precedes bekonan ‘close’. An
alternative analysis is that these are not postpositions, but rather nouns. In (34d) the tsëntsak is
used nominally without any other noun (i.e. just ‘in the middle’ not ‘in the middle of the room’).
Another analysis is that these are compound nouns, not postpositions.(34a) wabowan bëtsëkna tsa tsëntsak jakena

      ‘(arriving) at the middle, it begin to get bright.’ (Chindoy 70:14)8.5    Prepositional phrases
       Although Kamsá normally employs postpositions, it has borrowed some prepositions
from Spanish. There are no native prepositions in the language (only postpositions), but the
Spanish prepositions are very common now. In (35a), the preposition sin ‘without’ (from
Spanish sin ‘without’) precedes the noun tamo ‘salt’. Nouns governed by the loan preposition sin
take the instrumental case marker -k, as does tamo ‘salt’ below. If the preposition sin were not
present in this sentence, then the phrase would mean ‘with salt’, as illustrated in (35b).
       It is interesting to note that the language has postpositions, and that all subordinators go
at the end of clauses, such as the general subordinator -as and ora ‘when’, but that it has started
borrowing prepositions, and subordinators that go at the beginning of clauses (like ante ‘before’),
so now you can have a mix of things going at the end of phrases and clauses and at the beginning
                                                 211
of verbs and clauses. Furthermore, it is possible that adpositions and subordinators borrowed
from Spanish earlier (maybe several centuries ago) became postpositions or clause final
subordinators, such as ora ‘when’ from Spanish hora ‘time, hour’, whereas recent borrowings
became prepositions or clause initial subordinators.(35a) nÿe s̈men janÿets̈na sin tamok

      wameshnen [tamo=k]
      mote         [salt=INS]
      ‘mote (hominy soup) with salt’       In (36a) another common preposition. asta ‘until’ (from Spanish hasta ‘until’), precedes
bastok ‘Pasto (a city near Sibundoy)’. This preposition can have a noun or an infinitive object;
when it takes an infinitive, it is always an uninflected. In (36a) asta bastok means ‘until Pasto’. It
is unclear whether there is case marking on bastok because, like many place names, the
unmarked form is already locative (such as bogotok ‘Bogotá’; tabanok ‘Sibundoy’ and chatjok
‘Mocoa’). In (36b) asta ‘until’ is the preposition and the infinitive belongs to the prepositional
phrase. The verb jwenatjëmb ‘disappear’ is not inflected for person, number, or TAM. In (36c)
asta precedes shachna ‘five’, which is used substantively and has the plural marker -ëng.(36a) ch benach indëmën chatjokan asta bastok.

       Another preposition, also derived from Spanish, is parej ‘together with’ presumably from
parejo ‘similar, equal, close, next to’. It is interesting because its meaning has shifted from the
Spanish meaning mostly as an adjective to become a preposition. Its noun has a case marker:
commitative for animate nouns and instrumental for inanimate nouns. In (37a) parej
enuntëngaftaka means ‘together with (her) friends’ where enuntëng ‘friends’ has the comitative
marker -aftak. In (37b) parej twambianak means ‘together with that of the hen’ (meaning the
brother discarded the chili along with the piece of hen). Note that in (37b) the noun has the
ablative marker to show source; it does not have -bi even though it’s an animal (and living
animals are animate) because in this sense it is food; and it does not show any object marking.(37a) nÿe s̈ës̈etem jtsabmuchtkoyám parej enuntëngaftaka.

                             Simple clauses (monoclausal sentences)
9.1     Introduction
        In this chapter, I provide an overview of clause-level syntax in Kamsá, a clause being
minimally a verb and a subject (expressed or not expressed). Because verbs are marked for
person and number, a noun or pronoun is not obligatory, thus a clause could be simply a verb.
First I discuss clauses (9.2) including intransitive (9.2.1), predicative (9.2.2), then transitive
clauses (9.2.3) and clauses with complements (9.2.4). In (9.2.5) I discuss clauses with obliques
and in (9.2.6) I discuss ditransitive clauses. In (9.3) I discuss negation and in (9.4) I discuss
comparatives and superlatives. (9.5) covers imperatives and (9.6) describes interrogatives.
        Indexing on the verb clearly shows that the system is nominative-accusative: subjects of
transitive verbs have the same morphemes as subjects of intransitives, both contrasting with the
marking of objects of transitives. NPs and personal pronouns are not marked in any way for
Agent or Patient (see 3.3.3 on noun cases). As seen in the following examples, although the
nouns and pronouns do not have any morphology for case, the verbal morphology is
nominative/accusative.(1a)    ch bobonts tonjachemb tobias̈

transitive clauses (9.2.3), clauses with complements (9.2.4), clauses with obliques (9.2.5), and
ditransitive clauses (9.2.6).","[223, 224, 225, 226, 227, 228]"

9.2.6.1 Ditransitives with nouns
        In (7a) waben ‘sister’ is not marked, nor is tobias̈ ‘girl’ in (7b). Note that in (7a) the Goal
is at the end of the sentence whereas in (7b) the Theme tsjan ‘guinea pig’ is the last element in
the cause. Sometimes, however, the Goal has an allative marker as seen in (7c) with boya ‘man’.
Perhaps the allative has a different semantic connotation.(7a)    tonjopasaibs ch bata tbojeyam kanÿe twamb ats̈be waben
        tonjopasaibs ch        bata t-bo-jeyam     kanÿe twamb [ats̈-be                waben]

       ‘On the third day, they told the man everything.’ (Chindoy 80:33)9.2.6.2 Ditransitives with pronouns
       When the Goal is first or second person in a ditransitive, it is marked on the verb. If the
pronoun appears in the clause, which is optional, it does not have any special marking. In (8a),
the verb j-akwenta ‘tell’ is marked with s̈o-, the first person object marker. (8b) is repeated from
above to show comparison with j-achemb ‘call’ marked with s̈o- to agree with the object. In both
(8a) and (8b) the first person singular pronoun ats̈ is not marked.(8a)   Ats̈ s̈ochanjakwenta kanÿe kwent taita mandat.

       ‘The boy called me.’9.3    Negation
       Negation is shown by the negator word ndoñ, negative indefinite pronouns, and/or verbal
morphology. The language does not allow double negatives, meaning that either the negator
word ndoñ is used or a negative indefinite pronoun, but never both at the same time. The
language can have, however, negative verbal morphology and the negator ndoñ in the same
clause. When the verb is negative, the negator ndoñ is usually there but sometimes negation can
be shown by verbal morphology without the negator. Similarly, although the verb usually has
negative morphology, sometimes negation can be shown with ndoñ without any special
morphology on the verb. The verbal morphology of negation is discussed in 4.9. Here I discuss
the syntax of such constructions.","[233, 234]"

       A verb phrase in Kamsá consists minimally of a verb (8.3.1), but can, alternatively,
consist of a verb and its direct object (8.3.2), a verb and an oblique object (8.3.3), a verb and two
objects (ditransitive verbal constructions) (8.3.4), a verb, a direct object, and an oblique object
(8.3.5), a verb and an adverb (8.3.6), and a verb and a verbal complement (8.3.7), among other
possible combinations. Some (semantically) transitive verbs have within their argument structure
an object marked with an oblique case (8.3.8). There are also other possible pairings not
discussed here.","[215, 216]"

       It is interesting to note that there is a contrast between singular, plural, and dual first
person and no contrast between inclusive and exclusive plural first person, a common feature of
many languages in the area.
       Additionally, there are optional suffixes that show that the subject of a verb is plural or
dual (-ang and -at, respectively). Although these suffixes can co-occur with number marking
prefixes, they are often used when the number marking prefixes are not present.
       The following sentences show verbs marked with the first person plural prefix bs- (often
pronounced [fs-], perhaps because of different dialects or free variation). In (9a), the verb
jamnan ‘be’ is marked with the prefix bsë-, without any overt (pronominal) subject included in
the clause. In (9b), on the other hand, the first person plural pronoun bëng is present in the
clause, and the verb jets̈an ‘lose’ is marked with bsë- to agree with it. Similarly, in (9c), japasar
‘pass, be’ is marked with bsë-, indexing the first person plural pronoun bëng.(9a)   Bsëndanmën bëts tabanok.

       (Chindoy 64.36)      In (10a), the plural prefix mo- indexes the first person plural subject bëng on the verb j-
wabw-an ‘cook’. The verb is not marked for first person, only for plural. In (10b) there is no
pronoun, on the verb j-en-ebjën-an ‘meet’.(10a) Kadaté bëng mondwabwán wameshnen.

"Rule 1: Vowel deletionKamsá has no consecutive vowels within words. Whenever two vowels come together (over a
morpheme boundary), the first vowel is deleted. For example, when the allative marker -oj is
added to the noun txa ‘mountain’, /a/ in mountain is deleted.txa + oj →txoj ‘to the mountain’Rule 2: Vowel becomes glidei→j/_VIf the vowel is /i/, however, the next following vowel is not deleted. Instead /i/ is a glide, /j/.
When bata has the allative marker -oj after the animacy marker -bi, the /i/ is not deleted.bata + bj + oj → batabjoj ‘to the aunt’Rule 3: Optional devoicingWhen /b/ occurs before a voiceless consonant, it often becomes /f/ or /p/, although not always, as
seen above with [btʃend] ‘blue’, also pronounced as [ftʃe nd]./ibs/ ‘tomorrow’ can be pronounced [ips]Rule 4: Degeminationʂ + ʂ →ʂWhen there are two identical consonants in a row, only one is pronounced. Thus when the first
person object marker ʂ- precedes the second person plural subject marker ʂmo- on a verb, it is
realized as ʂmo, not ʂʂmo-.",[61]
