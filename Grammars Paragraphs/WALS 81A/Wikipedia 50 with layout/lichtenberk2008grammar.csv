3.1.    Morphosyntactic patternsThe basic constituent order of Toqabaqita is subject – predicate – X, where X
designates any element other than the subject and the predicate. Predicates may
be headed by a verb or be verbless, as in (3-1) and (3-2), respectively. The sub-
jects and the predicates are in square brackets, and so is the adjunct in (3-1):(3-1)      [Toqa baa ki] [keki           fula]       [i     qusungadi].
           people that PL 3PL.FUT arrive             LOC    tomorrow
           ‘The people will arrive tomorrow.’(3-2)      [Si      manga qeri] [si manga qana                 baabarikoke].
           PRTT     time       this PRTT time     GENP         cold.wind
           ‘This time is the time of cold winds.’    More than one adjunct can occur in a clause, but for most types their order is
not strictly fixed. Temporal adjuncts normally come last, unless a clause con-
tains an element that can only occur clause-finally, such as a situational demon-
strative adverb. The second clause in (3-3) contains a locative-source and a
temporal adjunct:(3-3)      Nau kaa-karangi-a               sa     kwai    qaru bo=naqa

           GENP      breadfruit LOC yesterday
           ‘I very nearly fell off the breadfruit (tree) yesterday.’
44      Grammatical profile
    In verbal clauses the basic order is SVX and AVOX, where S represents an
intransitive subject, A a transitive subject, O a direct object, and V a verb.
Clauses are organized on a nominative-accusative pattern. Ss and As are in-
dexed by means of preverbal subject markers that simultaneously mark other
grammatical categories: tense, aspect, sequentiality, negation, or dehortation.
Lexical Os are indexed by suffixes on verbs. (Direct objects encoded by means
of the independent personal pronouns can occur only with one of the two main
classes of transitive verbs and are not indexed.) In (3-4) the S is indexed by the
first person singular nonfuture subject marker ku, and so is the A in (3-5). The
lexical O doqora-mu ‘your sibling’ (here ‘your brother’) in (3-5) is indexed by
the third person object suffix -a.","[72, 73]"
"(19-34)    Taa       neri?
           what? NPAST.HERE
           ‘What is this?’    With one type of exception to be discussed in section 19.3.4, interrogative
prepositional phrases headed by a verb-like preposition or by a noun-like prepo-
sition cannot be fronted. Only the complement of the preposition is fronted and
the preposition is stranded behind (section 10.6):(19-35)    Wela taa     n=e                     ngali-a    fanga       qeri
           child which? FOC=3SG.NFUT            take-3.OBJ food        that           fasi-a?
           ABL-3SG.OBJ
           ‘Which child did he take the food from?’(19-36)    Tei n=o                    fale-a     lole        qeri qi

800    Interrogatives
   Fronting of an interrogative phrase into focus must be distinguished from a
type of interrogative sentence where the verb together with an interrogative
phrase precede the subject. This order occurs in one subtype of locational inter-
rogative sentences: a locative verb followed by one of the forms for ‘where?’
precedes the subject:(19-37)    [locative.verb ‘where?’] subject   For example:(19-38)    Nii        fei        naifa nau baa?
           be.located where? knife 1SG that
           ‘Where is my knife?’ ‘Where is that knife of mine?’   Although the verb phrase precedes the subject, it is not in the focus position.
First, the focus marker na cannot occur here. Second, a locative prepositional
phrase that contains fei can be fronted by itself and be in focus. In such cases a
prepositional phrase that consists of the general locative preposition qi and the
locative pro-form ei (section 10.2.2) must appear at the extraction site. In (19-
39) the locative interrogative phrase i fei ‘(at) where?’ is in focus, and there is a
prepositional phrase with the locative pro-form after the locative verb:(19-39)    Nee, ma       i      fei    na  qaburu naqi qe
           hey and       LOC    where? FOC ogre   this 3SG.NFUT           ni=i                ei?
           be.located=LOC LOCPRO
           ‘Hey, where is this ogre [we have been talking about]?’   On the other hand, the locative pro-form is not used in the inverted word
order; see (19-38).
   And third, as discussed in section 19.3.11, certain intensifying particles can
be used inside interrogative phrases to express emphatic questions, but only if
the interrogative phrase is in focus. In (19-40) the intensifier is qana:(19-40)    Ni            tei       qana n=o          ngata
           PERSMKR       who?      INTS FOC=2SG.NFUT speak           bii-a?
           COM-3SG.OBJ
           ‘Who was it that you spoke with?’
                                                    19.3 Open interrogatives   801   The intensifying particles cannot be used in the inverted structure.
   The inverted word order is not obligatory, and locational interrogatives with
the verb phrase in the canonical position do not necessarily express echo ques-
tions:(19-41)    Naifa    nau ba=e          nii                 fei?
           knife    1SG that=3SG.NFUT be.located          where?
           ‘Where is my knife?’    With the exception of the type of interrogative with inverted, [verb.phrase
subject] order and one other type of sentence where the verb comes before the
subject (negative existential sentences, discussed in section 26.1.2.2), verbs
cannot occur before their subjects, whether in interrogatives or elsewhere, and
the interrogative verbs qufita ‘be how?’, ‘do what?’, ‘do how?’ and its transi-
tive counterpart qufita-a ‘do what? to/with (st.)’, ‘do st. how?’ can only occur
in situ:(19-42)    Era ba=e             qufita  naqa?
           fire that=3SG.NFUT be.how? PRF
           ‘How is the fire now?’ ‘How is the fire doing now?’ (Is it burning
           well now?)    The distinction between open interrogatives with the interrogative phrase in
situ on the one hand and ones where the interrogative phrase has been fronted
and focused or where the order is [verb.phrase subject] on the other is, then,
not categorical, either in terms of their use or in the syntactic conditions under
which the constructions occur. For this reason no separate type of echo inter-
rogatives is recognized for Toqabaqita.
    Only one interrogative phrase is possible in a clause, regardless of whether
both of them were to be in situ or one of them were to be fronted.","[852, 853, 854]"

           PERSMKR     Saelifiqa
           (‘Follow me and Saelifiqa.’ [Lit.: ‘Go behind me and Saelifiqa.’])   Inclusory constructions where the order is [inclusory-pronoun included-NP]
cannot function as objects of Class 2 transitive verbs and the noun-like preposi-
tion, or as possessors in suffixing possessive constructions. However, if they
have been “displaced” from those positions, such sentences are grammatical.
One way in which an inclusory construction may be displaced is by being
placed in a later position, as a kind of “afterthought”, for example for clarifica-
tion. The verb, the preposition, or the possessum noun carries an ob-
ject/possessor suffix that denotes the superset, and the later inclusory construc-
tion provides more detail by specifying the subset. Typically, there is a slight
pause between the displaced inclusory construction and the preceding material,
indicated by a comma in the examples below. While (14-20) above, with an
inclusory construction in the possessor position, is ungrammatical, (14-21)
664    Constructions with inclusory pronominals
below, with the inclusory construction outside, after the possessor position, is
grammatical:(14-21)    Lae    ma=i         buria-mareqa,         kamareqa
           go     VENT=LOC     behind-1DU(EXCL).PERS 1DU(EXCL)           ni           Saelifiqa.
           PERSMKR      Saelifiqa
           ‘Follow the two of us, me and Saelifiqa.’    Similarly, (14-22) is grammatical even though the order of the constituents
in the inclusory construction is [inclusory-pronoun included-NP], because the
inclusory construction does not function as the direct object of the Class 2 tran-
sitive verb:(14-22)    Kera       thaitoqoma-mareqa,       kamareqa wela nau.

   An inclusory construction can be displaced into the topic position, and there
too the order [inclusory-pronoun included-NP] is grammatical. In (14-23) be-
low, the inclusory construction occurs in the possessor position, and the order
can only be [included-NP inclusory-pronoun]. (The person marker tha has
fused with the possessum noun, and so the third person personal suffix -na is
absent.)(14-23)    Nuu=tha                       Uluta      kamaroqa    qe

14.2.5. In the object position with the bare prepositions and in the possessor
        position in the bare possessive noun phraseThe bare prepositions do not index their complements, and similarly the pos-
sessum nouns of bare possessive constructions do not index the possessor
phrases. When a phrasal inclusory construction functions as the complement of
a bare preposition or as the possessor phrase in a bare possessive construction,
the inclusory pronominal and the included NP can occur in either order. The
examples in (14-26) and (14-27) illustrate this for the equative preposition
mala, and those in (14-28) and (14-29) for possessive constructions:(14-26)    Roo wane naqi ki qe                   aqi   kesi         raa

14.2.6.     The proximity principleThe proximity principle determines whether or not there is indexing of a
phrasal inclusory construction on the head of which the inclusory construction
is a dependent. The head element may be a Class 1 or a Class 2 transitive verb,
of which the inclusory construction is the direct object; it may be a verb-like or
a noun-like preposition, of which the inclusory construction is the object; and it
may be the possessum noun in a suffixing possessive construction, of which the
inclusory construction is the possessor modifier.
    The proximity principle applies only within phrases: verb phrases, two types
of prepositional phrases, and one type of noun phrase. It does not apply in the
subject position in relation to the subject markers, where the two elements do
not occur together in a phrase, subject markers being constituents in the verb
phrase.
    It is that constituent of a phrasal inclusory construction that is nearer the
governing head that determines whether there will be indexing on the head or
not, and the kind of indexing. In all such cases, the included NP can come first:
the head element carries indexing that applies to lexical objects and to lexical
possessors (see examples [14-12], [14-14], [14-18], and [14-19]). When an
inclusory construction functions as the object of a Class 1 transitive verb or a
verb-like preposition, the inclusory pronoun may come first, in which case there
is no indexing on the verb or on the preposition ([14-11] and [14-13]).
    The proximity principle is given in a summary form in (14-30) (Lichtenberk
2000a: 20):(14-30)       The proximity principle: In a phrasal inclusory construction, it is the
              constituent nearer the element that governs the inclusory construc-
              tion that is relevant to the relation between the inclusory construc-
              tion and the element that governs it, regardless of whether that con-
              stituent is or is not the head of the inclusory construction. The
              domain of application of the proximity principle is a phrase: a verb
              phrase, a prepositional phrase, or a possessive noun phrase.
                                         14.2 Phrasal inclusory constructions   66714.2.7. Variation in the order of the inclusory pronoun and the included NPThe inclusory pronoun denotes the superset, and the included NP denotes,
overtly, a proper subset. There is another proper subset, but this one does not
receive overt expression. This latter, covert subset is complementary to the one
denoted by the included NP. For example, in the inclusory construction in (14-
31), the included NP wela nau ki ‘my children’ overtly denotes one subset,
while the complementary subset, which consists of the speaker and possibly
other individuals (such as the speaker’s wife) are denoted only covertly:(14-31)    … ma      wela nau      ki kamiliqa     misi          fii
             and     child 1SG     PL 1PL(EXCL)    1PL(EXCL).NEG expect           qoe boqo qoki       fula    i     sa-miliqa.
           2SG ASRT 2SG.FUT arrive     LOC GOAL-1PL(EXCL).PERS
           ‘… and my children and I/we did not expect you at all to come to
           us.’    As shown in some of the preceding sections, in certain syntactic positions
the inclusory pronoun and the included NP can occur in either order. There is a
pragmatic difference between the two orderings, specifically the relative de-
grees of discourse salience of the participants encoded overtly and those de-
noted only covertly. If the participants encoded overtly by the included NP are
more salient, the included NP comes first, before the inclusory pronoun. On the
other hand, if it is the superset or the covertly denoted subset that is relatively
salient, the inclusory pronoun comes first.
    Discourse salience has to do, partly, with whether or not the relevant entity
is the centre of attention at the moment. An entity that is the centre of attention
has higher discourse salience than one that is not. Being in the centre of atten-
tion includes being the current topic, being in focus, and being in contrast. Sec-
ond, salience has to do with participation in the speech act. Participants in the
speech act are more salient than non-participants.
    The next few examples illustrate the effect of discourse salience on the or-
dering of the two constituents of phrasal inclusory constructions. In (14-32)
speaker A asks about a third person. That person is the current discourse topic;
in B’s response the inclusory pronoun, which covertly denotes that person,
comes first:(14-32)    A: Teqe nia      bana      n=e                 lae?
              sole 3SG      LIM       FOC=3SG.NFUT        go

           A. ‘Was it just him (lit.: sole him) who went?’
           B: ‘He and his wife.’   On the other hand in (14-33) it is the included NP that comes first. The
speaker is inquiring about the whereabouts of Ulufaalu and some other people.
Those people are identified as being associated with Ulufaalu. It is Ulufaalu
who is the centre of attention.","[692, 693, 694, 695, 696, 697]"
"
37.2.    Direct speech is not necessarily direct quotationBefore considering the means that serve to express direct speech, one note of
clarification is in order. So-called direct speech does not necessarily reproduce
verbatim another person’s speech. Not infrequently, it reproduces just the con-
tent or the gist of what the other person said, rather than the exact words. For
example, as pointed out by Haiman (1985), what was originally said may have
been delivered in a language other than that used to report it in a direct speech.
This is illustrated in the next two examples. In the first one, what the direct
speech is presented as reporting is what an American officer had allegedly said
to one or more representatives of the British colonial government in Honiara
sometime in the 1940s. It is a safe assumption that the language used was not
Toqabaqita.",[1276]

    ‘The way they use it [the saying], its time is like this: when they hear a
    loud story (being told by you) about something that you have done but it is
    not finished, a person will just say, “Man!, don’t act like Liliqa.”.’
Notes39. Lichtenberk (1987) is an earlier study of the irrealis marker, which is superseded
    by the present analysis.
40. Quri can take nominalizations of other verbs as its subject, but in such cases it has
    the basic meaning ‘resemble, be like’, expressing comparison of equality, not epis-
    temic possibility. For example:     (i)    Wane naqi, ngata-la-na                 qe       quri-a        wane
            man this talk-NMLZ-3SG.PERS            3SG.NFUT be.like-3.OBJ man            qe         thaitoqome-qe doo, ….
            3SG.NFUT know-DETR            thing
            ‘This man talks like someone who knows a lot (but he doesn’t know a
            thing).” (Lit.: ‘This man, his talking is like a man who knows things, ….’)41. In Lichtenberk (1995) the term “avertive” was used. However, to avoid confusion
    with the avertive constructions (sections 5.1.7 and 15.1.2.3.3), the term “preven-
    tive” has been adopted here.
42. Compare the English expression shout somebody a drink/lunch, etc.
43. Lichtenberk (2007b) is an earlier study of constructions that serve to express recip-
    rocal and related meanings in Toqabaqita. That study was originally written in the
    mid-1990s and is superseded by the present work. However, the reference to it in
    section 21.1 with respect to the development of the earlier prefix *wai is valid.
44. Compare mala ‘quite, indeed, even’ in the closely related Kwara’ae language
    (Deck 1934: 89).
45. The terms “comparee”, “comparative predicate”, and “clause of comparison” have
    been adopted from Stassen (1985: 26).
46. In Lichtenberk (1991b) it was stated that bii and bia could not link clauses at all.
    At that time no examples of such use had been recorded.
        Bii and bia developed from an earlier transitive verb ‘accompany’ into a comi-
    tative preposition and then a noun-phrase conjunction, and their use to connect
    clauses is another step in a series of grammaticalization stages. As argued in
    Lichtenberk (1991a), one would not expect the clause-conjoining function to de-
    velop before the noun-phrase conjoining function.
47. Called “utterance” complement-taking verbs by Noonan.
48. When a Pijin word has more than one variant, the form given here is the one nor-
    mally used by Toqabaqita people when speaking Pijin.
49. The meanings ‘bathe (os.)’ and ‘bathe sb.’ are expressed in Pijin by suim and
    suimim, respectively. Their Toqabaqita equivalents are siisiu (intr.) and siu-fi
    (Class 1 tr.), respectively.

2.5.     Cliticization and fusionWith some exceptions, monosyllabic grammatical elements cliticize to the pre-
ceding word in the clause, if there is one.(2-69)      /na7 k7        6ana/                 [np7k7 6apn$a]
            1SG 1SG.NFUT be.hungry
            ‘I am hungry.’(2-70)      /la' s+    ma+/                       /lap's+ mp+/
            go PREC VENT
            ‘Come here now.’   Since such grammatical elements have no stress of their own, in some cases
such cliticization results in an additional syllable of the host being stressed in
order for sequences of more than two unstressed syllables next to each other
not to arise. In (2-71) the plural marker /k+/ has cliticized on the trisyllabic verb
/ba!+ta/. It is not only the first syllable of /ba!+ta/ that receives stress but the last
syllable as well:(2-71)      /bn6n ba!+ta        k+/         [mbnp&n mby!+tpk+]
            pig      be.big     PL
            ‘big pigs’    Compare (2-72), where the plural marker is not present, and it is only the
first syllable of /ba!+ta/ that carries stress:
34   Phonology

           pig       be.big
           ‘big pig’   If there is no preceding host available, because the grammatical element is
clause initial or because there is a pause between the grammatical element and
the preceding word, monosyllabic elements cliticize onto the following word.
However, even though they are word initial, they do not, with two types of ex-
ception, receive stress:(2-73)     /!'        la' +       mas7!7/        /!'lap' + mps7!7/
           3SG.NFUT go LOC bush
           ‘She went into the bush.’ (Euphemistically for ‘She went to the toi-

           ‘Ulufaalu has arrived.’           [6a7y:l7$apa:l7 !'$7pl nap!a]   One type of exception concerns the combination of the third person singular
nonfuture subject marker /!'/ with the negative verb /a!+/. As mentioned in the
discussion of stress in section 2.3, here it is more common for the subject
marker, and not the first syllable of the verb, to carry stress,(2-75)     /!'         a!+/        [!'pp !+]

           ‘No.’ (As an answer to a question.)See also (2-78) further below, and sections 17.3 and 17.4 for further discus-
sion.)
   The other type of exception concerns the general locative preposition /-!+/.
This preposition cliticizes to the following word when that word is grammati-
cal, unless it fuses with the preceding element (see further below for fusion),
and it is the preposition that carries word-initial stress:(2-76)     /al'-a         !+ a-na/                 [apl'a !+p$na]
           give-3SG.OBJ LOC REC-3SG.PERS

                                                   2.5 Cliticization and fusion   35(2-77)     /…   k'kn           !ar7-a      a7      !+    '+ …./
                3DU.SEQ drop-3.OBJ stone            LOC LOCPRO

netic form in (2-77) see further below.
   Neighbouring monosyllabic elements cliticize to each other:(2-78)     /na7 !'           a!+               ta        a !nta/
           1SG 3SG.NFUT not.be.available some            CLF areca.nut

           available.’)           [np7 !'p!+ tap$a !npta]   Cliticization is not indicated when examples are presented in the orthogra-
phy in the rest of the grammar; but see further below for the combination of the
third person singular subject marker /!'/ and the negative verb /a!+/.
    Cliticization as discussed above must be distinguished from what is here
referred to as “fusion” of two or sometimes even three words. In fusion, the two
or three lexical and/or grammatical words form one phonological word, and the
non-final component or components that make up a fused word lose some of
their phonological material at their ends, a segment, a syllable or even two syl-
lables. With one type of exception, the final component occurs in its full form.
The exception is grammatical elements that begin with a glottal stop: they lose
the glottal stop when fused to the preceding element. Words that have fused
together behave as single phonological words for the purposes of stress assign-
ment.
    Fusion is signalled in the grammar by means of an equal sign: =, including
when examples are presentend in the orthography.
    Fusion may involve grammatical words or lexical words. In some cases,
fusion is obligatory. Obligatory fusion involves certain combinations of gram-
matical words: when two or three such words occur next to each other, fusion
must take place. The reduced forms in which morphemes that obligatorily un-
dergo fusion occur are referred to in the grammar as the “combining” forms of
those morphemes. (A few morphemes must occur in their combining forms
when a bound morpheme is suffixed to them.)
    Fusion is obligatory when certain postverbal particles occur next to each
other. A few examples are given in (2-79). (For further discussion and exam-
ples see section 5.2.)

                    ASRT/INTS      PRF/INTS           VENT    [bnynamp+]    In other cases, fusion is optional and its frequence of occurrence varies. In
normal speech, the demonstrative /!er+/ ‘this’, ‘that’ and the plural marker /k+/
always fuse as /!'=k+/ ‘those’, ‘these’, although the unfused sequence /!er+/ /k+/
is accepted by speakers of the language as grammatical. The sequence of /k7la/
‘place’ and /na!+/ ‘this’ is normally realized as /k7=na!+/, rather than without
fusion.
    The general preposition /!ana/ more often than not fuses with consonant-
initial monosyllabic grammatical morphemes. It either has the form /!a=/, or
/!an=/. /!a=/ occurs regardless of the nature of the following consonant, while
/!an=/ occurs only before dental consonants:(2-80)     a.       /!ana/    /a/ /6atn/     /baa/     /!a=a 6atn baa/
                    GENP     CLF   day        that

                    GENP     some     PRTT food
                    ‘with some of the food’   The general preposition also frequently fuses, as /!an=/, with the numeral
/t'!'/ ‘one’:(2-81)     /!ana/   /t'!'/      /a/ /6atn/      /!an=t'!' a 6atn/
           GENP     one         CLF day

                                                    2.5 Cliticization and fusion   37   Optional fusion is common in fast speech, and it may take place across ma-
jor syntactic boundaries. In (2-82) the preposition /!+/ fuses with the andative
directional, which is part of the verb phrase, instead of cliticizing to the follow-
ing element, which is what often happens elsewhere (see the discussion of this
preposition further above in this section):(2-82)     /la' ka7 !+  sa-na/                    /la' ka=+ sa-na/
           go AND LOC ADJC-3SG.PERS
           ‘Go to him.’   The subject markers that begin with a glottal stop fuse with the preceding
word, and the glottal stop is deleted. These subject markers often fuse with the
relative-clause marker, the focus marker, and the complementizer /na/:(2-83)     a.     /na/        /!n/            /n=n/
                              2SG.NFUT
           b.     /na/        /!nk+/          /n=nk+/

           c.     /na/        /!ns+/          /n=ns+/
                              2SG.NEG
           d.     /na/        /!'/            /n='/
                              3SG.NFUT   For example:(2-84)     /n+        t'+     n=n                     r+k+-a/
           PERSMKR who?       FOC=3SG.NFUT            see-3SG.OBJ
           ‘Who did you see?’   Among the subject markers that begin with a glottal stop, it is the third per-
son singular nonfuture tense one that most frequently, and commonly, fuses
with the preceding element. In the next two examples it fuses, respectively,
with a nominalization in the subject position and with a demonstrative as the
last element of the subject phrase:(2-85)     /0ata-la-na             !'          ma7l+-!a/
           speak-NMLZ-3SG.PERS 3SG.NFUT be.on.left.side-PROP
           ‘He spoke in a clumsy, non-fluent, non-idiomatic way.’           with fusion: /0ata-la-n=' ma7l+-!a/
38   Phonology
   In (2-86) two geminate vowels disappear in fusion. This is the only type of
case when two syllables are deleted, although it is possible for only the last
vowel to be deleted.(2-86)     /dnn    !nrn        baa !'    makdpa/
           thing   be.many that 3SG.NFUT smell
           ‘Those many things smelled.’           with fusion: /dnn !nrn b=' makdpa/   And in (2-87) the third person nonfuture subject marker has fused with
/mada/, which is a conjunction ‘or’ and also serves to signal less than full cer-
tainty on the part of the speaker about the factual status of a proposition:(2-87)     /mada !'              mata!+/             /mad=' mata!+/
           or      3SG.NFUT be.sick
           ‘He might be sick.’ ‘Is he perhaps sick?’   Similarly, the general locative preposition /!+/ loses its glottal stop when it
fuses with the preceding element; see (2-77) and (2-82) further above, and (2-
89) further below.
   Fusion may take place when one word begins with a consonant that is iden-
tical to the consonant in the last syllable of the preceding word. The final vowel
of the first word is deleted and the two identical consonants are realized as one
long one:(2-88)     /maka kam+l+!a/
           father 1PL(EXCL)
           ‘our father(s)’           with fusion: /mak=kam+l+!a/        [mák:ym+l+p!]
                       father =1PL(EXCL)See examples (2-16a) – (2-16c) in section 2.2.1.
   Fusion may result in the elision of a morpheme. Only monosyllabic suffixes
are elided through fusion. The third person singular object suffixes /-a/ and
/-na/ and the third person singular personal suffix /-na/ may be elided when the
word they are part of fuses with the following word. Although the morpheme
has been elided, its notional presence is indicated in the morphemic glosses.
The gloss for the elided morpheme is joined to the preceding one by means of a
colon. In (2-89) the locative preposition /!+/ has fused with the preceding transi-
tive verb, and the object-indexing suffix has been elided:

"   There is a fair amount of heterosemy (Lichtenberk 1991a) in the language,
with forms representing one and the same etymon belonging in different word
classes. For example, there is a form that functions as an intransitive verb ‘end,
finish; be finished’, as a completive/exhaustive particle in verb phrases, as an
exhaustive particle in noun phrases, as a sequencing particle, and as an adversa-
tive coordinator. Another form functions as a comitative preposition and as a
noun-phrase coordinator, and, rarely, as a clause coordinator. There is also a
high degree of grammatical polysemy, with one and the same grammatical ele-
ment (a member of one word class) having more than one function.

The verb phrase
4.1.     The basic structure of the verb phraseThe Toqabaqita verb phrase minimally consists of a verb. In addition to a verb,
there may be a variety of other constituents in a verb phrase. The basic struc-
ture of the verb phrase is given in (4-1). The significance of the raised numerals
is explained further below.","[82, 83]"

AcknowledgementsFirst and foremost, my thanks go to Lawrence Foana’ota and Reuel Riianoa. I
first started working on the language with Lawrence in 1981, when he was a
student at the University of Auckland. And it was Lawrence who introduced me
to the late Reuel Riianoa of Laathalu Village, who became my primary lan-
guage consultant. Reuel was highly respected in the community for his knowl-
edge of the language and traditional concepts at a time when many of the tradi-
tional ways of life had disappeared or may disappear before long.
     A number of other people have contributed, over the years, to this grammar,
whether with texts or other kinds of data. Here I wish to thank Siufimama
(Lawrence’s late grandmother), John Kwanairara (Reuel’s late father), Adam
Ulufaalu Kwanairara (Reuel and his wife Rosina’s son), Reni, Olofia, Ellen
Kanatolea, Penuel Idusulia (the school principal at Malu’u, for general discus-
sions about the Toqabaqita language), Fred Saeni (with whom I worked on the
language during his visits to Auckland), Kado Kamanesi, Rosina Foialatha
(Reuel’s wife) and Liah Lifungangale (Lifuna) (Reuel and Rosina’s daughter)
for information about a disguised-speech variety known to some women, and to
Cathrine Saelifia (Adam Ulufaalu’s daughter) for demonstration of Pig-Latin
Toqabaqita used by children.
     My first period of field work in Toqabaqita was in December 1984–
February 1985. This was followed by five more periods, the last one being in
August–November 1999. During my stays in Laathalu Village I enjoyed the
hospitality and generosity of Reuel Riianoa and Rosina Foialatha’s extended
family, which includes the families of their son Adam Ulufaalu and his wife
Alice Edanamae, and their daughter Liah Lifungangale (Lifuna). On the coast,
at Malu’u, there was the always welcoming house of Reuel and Rosina’s other
daughter Joy Edarodo (Edata) and her husband Fred Matangani (Mata). On
various occasions I also enjoyed the company of Eddie Kanari, Kanatolea,
Saeni, David Rara, and many others. Lawrence Foana’ota was always a good
and helpful friend when I was in Honiara for brief periods of time.
     My work on the Toqabaqita language was supported by several grants from
the University of Auckland Research Fund, which are gratefully acknowledged.
     One round of revisions of the grammar was completed while I was an Hon-
orary Visiting Fellow at the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology at La
Trobe University, on research and study leave from the University of Auckland.
I wish to thank R.M.W. Dixon and Alexandra Aikhenvald for making it possi-
ble for me to spend six months, February–July 2006, at the Research Centre.

    The grammar took its final shape while I was a visitor in the Department of
Linguistics, Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, for
four months, August–December 2006, while still on research and study leave
from the University of Auckland. I thank Bernard Comrie for making my stay at
the Institute possible.
    I am indebted to Bernard Comrie for reading the near-final version and for
commenting in detail on matters of substance as well as style. The final product
has profited immensely from that. And I wish to thank Juliette Blevins for
comments on chapter 2.
    My thanks to Andrew Hardie for producing the maps and to Andreea
Calude for assistance with the final layout.
    Last but not least, I wish to thank the Walter de Gruyter Foundation for a
generous grant that made publication of this grammar possible.

Introduction
1.1.    The language and the peopleToqabaqita is an Austronesian language spoken at the north-western tip of the
island of Malaita in the Solomon Islands (maps 1.1 and 1.2). Tryon and Hack-
man (1983) consider Toqabaqita to be a dialect of a “North Malaitan” language,
together with Baeguu, Baelelea, and Fataleka (map 1.3 in section 1.3). They say
that Lau could also have been included as another dialect, but they have chosen
to consider it “a separate entity”, for reasons of “tradition” (Tryon and Hack-
man 1983: 27, fn 1). There are a number of other closely related languages
spoken on Malaita. To my knowledge, there is no conception among the Toqa-
baqita people of a single language of which Toqabaqita, Baeguu, Baelelea,
Fataleka, and Lau would be dialects. They do, of course, recognize the similari-
ties between Toqabaqita on the one hand and the other languages/dialects on
the other, just as they recognize the similarities between Toqabaqita and other
languages spoken on Malaita.
    Ethnologue gives the number of speakers of Toqabaqita as 12,572 in 1999
(Gordon 2005), which is a high number in the Solomons Islands context. (Eth-
nologue gives the name of the language as To’abaita.). Although bilingualism
in Toqabaqita and Solomon Islands Pijin is the norm (see chapter 40), it is To-
qabaqita that is the language of daily life. And although children are exposed to
Solomon Islands Pijin at an early age, it is Toqabaqita that they acquire as their
first language. At present the viability of the language is not under threat.
    The Toqabaqita people are primarily subsistence gardeners and practice
swidden agriculture. The main crops are sweet potatoes, taro, slippery cabbage
(Hibiscus manihot), bananas, sugar cane, and cassava. Yam and pana (Dio-
scorea esculenta) are of secondary importance as food crops. Tomatoes, spring
onions, snake beans, and a few other vegetables are also cultivated. The main
tree crops are coconuts, breadruit, canarium nuts, areca nuts, cutnuts (Barring-
tonia sp.), mangoes, pawpaws, guava, and Malay apples. Raising of chickens
and pigs is a common practice. Possums and flying foxes are hunted for meat.
There is some fishing, both in the sea and in the rivers and streams. Tinned tuna
and imported rice feature importantly in the diet of those who can readily afford
them. The gardens are usually located some walking distance from the villages,
2   Introduction
many of them on hill sides and mountain sides. Copra and cocoa are the
primary sources of cash.","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]"

14.2.4. In the direct-object position with Class 2 transitive verbs, in the
        oblique-object position with the noun-like prepositions, and in the pos-
        sessor position in the suffixing possessive noun phraseWhat all these positions have in common is the fact that elsewhere the heads of
the constructions carry the same type of suffix to index the object or the posses-
sor, called “object” suffixes when they occur on verbs, and “personal” suffixes
when they occur on the noun-like prepositions and on possessum nouns. Class 2
transitive verbs, the noun-like prepositions, and the possessum nouns in suffix-
ing possessive constructions must carry an object/personal suffix, and they can
have only lexical objects/possessors.
   With Class 2 transitive verbs, the noun-like prepositions, and suffixing pos-
sessive constructions, only one order of the constituents in phrasal inclusory
constructions is possible: the included NP must come first and the inclusory
pronoun second. In (14-18) the inclusory construction functions as the direct
object of the verb. The verb carries the third person “singular” object suffix,
used elsewhere with lexical objects. The proximity principle applies here.",[691]
"
2.3.    StressStress is not phonemic in Toqabaqita, although there is potential for two com-
pound words to be distinguished only by stress position; see further below for
discussion. Stress assignment is governed by the following rules:
    I. The initial syllable of a word is stressed. There is one type of exception to
this rule: when a monosyllabic grammatical morpheme cliticizes onto the fol-
lowing lexical word, the stress is on the first syllable of the lexical element.
However, when the lexical word is the negative verb /a!+/ ‘not be so, not be the
case’, ‘not exist’, ‘not be available’ and the third person singular subject marker
/!'/ procliticizes onto it, more often than not the stress is on the subject marker.
    II. The final syllable of a word is never stressed, except in cases of vowel
elision (section 2.2.1).
    III. Neighbouring syllables cannot both be stressed, except in cases of vowel
elision (section 2.2.1).
    IV. There cannot be more than two unstressed syllables next to each other.
    V. In words that involve derivation, the stem has the same stress pattern as
in its base form (without derivation), unless rule IV would thereby be violated.
    VI. In compounds, each component has the same pattern it would have as an
independent word, unless rule IV would thereby be violated.
    VII. Grammatical morphemes of one syllable are normally unstressed and
cliticize onto the preceding or the following word. When they do not cliticize
(in very slow speech), they receive weak stress (and the vowel is lengthened).
    VIII. In words with more than one stress, the final stress tends to be margin-
ally stronger than the other stress(es).
20   Phonology
   Other factors having to do with stress assignment are discussed further be-
low.
   Primary stress is indicated with “ p”, and secondary stress with “ y”. Here are
some examples:(2-35)     a.    /k'7/               [k'p$7]          ‘fall over’
           b.    /a+/                 [p:+]           ‘woman’
           c.    /7arn/              [7prn]         ‘crocodile’
           d.    /6a+a/               [6p+]          ‘tree sp.: Parinari glaber-
                                                       rima’
           e.    /k''k'n'/            [k'y':k'pn']     ‘breadfruit’
           f.    /waa-wa'la/          [0waya: 0wap'la] ‘keep on laughing’
                 RDP-laugh
           g.    /f7ta-ma'/      [f7ytamap']    ‘epilepsy’
                 be.born-die
           h.    /a!a-7la7-a/              [ay!7yl$7p]
                 CAUS-work.hard-3SG.OBJ      ‘make him/her work hard’  The next example shows stress on the first syllable of a lexical word to
which a monosyllabic grammatical morpheme has procliticized:(2-36)     /!'         la'/           [!'lap']
           3SG.NFUT go
           ‘he/she/it went’  However, with the negative verb /a!+/ it is the subject marker /!'/ that nor-
mally attracts stress (sections 17.3 and especially 17.4):(2-37)     /!'         a!+/        [!'pp !+]
           3SG.NFUT not.be.so
           ‘No.’ (As an answer to a question.)More detail on clititization is given in section 2.5.
  Final stressed syllables arise when a word-final vowel is deleted in a gram-
matical word of the form ...Vi!Vi## (section 2.2.1):(2-38)     /!'           a!+        bn!n/        [!'pp !+ bnp!]
           3SG.NFUT not.be.so ASRT
           ‘Not at all.’ (As an answer to a question.)
                                                                        2.3 Stress   21   Sequences of stressed syllables arise only when the vowel of the first of two
syllables is deleted, whether word-internally or across word boundaries when
two words become one phonetic word (section 2.2.1):(2-39)     a.    /a!a-!akdpaa-a/              [ay!:apkdpa:a]
                 CAUS-be.cured-3SG.OBJ
                 ‘cure him/her/it’           b.    /wan' daraa/                         [wayndapra:a]
                 man      be.young.and.single
                 ‘young, single man’   The presence of a monosyllabic suffix may result in the addition of stress to
the base. This happens when the base has two final unstressed syllables as an
independent word, and the addition of the suffix would result in three un-
stressed syllables next to each other. For example:(2-40)     a.    /77s+/ [7p:7s+]         and   /77s+-a/          [7y:7s+p]
                 ‘buy’                         buy-DVN

                                               ‘scold him/her’   The addition or a word-final monosyllabic suffix to a disyllabic base does
not affect the stress:

                                             ‘see them’   The addition of a disyllabic suffix never results in a change in the stress
pattern of the base, because the first vowel of the suffix receives stress. How-
ever, the base will have secondary, rather than primary, stress. For example, the
nominalizing suffix /-laa/ is disyllabic, and it does not effect changes in the
stress patterns of the stems to which it is added:(2-42)       /la'/ [lap']      and     /la'-laa/          [lay'lapa:]

                                       ‘going’   Compare the suffix /-laa/, which derives (action) nominalizations, and the
suffix /-a/, which derives deverbal nouns, in (2-43). The former does not result
in an additional stress in the base, while the latter does:(2-43)       /77s+/ [7p:7s+]         and           /77s+-laa/           [7y:7s+lpa:]

                                                   ‘market’   The suffix that derives nominalizations has the form /-laa/ when word-final.
It has the monosyllabic form /-la/ when it is followed by an inflectional per-
sonal suffix. In the latter case, the nominalizing suffix is stressed because of the
presence of the personal suffix:(2-44)       /77s+-la-na         s7ka/             [7y:7s+lpna s7pk]

tional, are added, unless this would result in a sequence of more than two un-
stressed syllables.
   A few transitive verbs contain two derivational suffixes: a monosyllabic
stem extender followed by a long, disyllabic transitive suffix. All such verbs
have disyllabic roots. For stress assignment purposes, the stem extender is
treated as part of the stem and does not receive stress, while the transitive suffix
is stressed on its first syllable. In (2-45a) there is an intransitive verb, a long
transitive verb with the stem extender /-la/ and the long transitive suffix /-0an+/
based on the intransitive verb; and in (2-45b) there is a short transitive verb
derived from the same base by means of the short, monosyllabic transitive suf-
fix /-l+/, without the stem extender:(2-45)
         a.      /takdp'/ [tapkdp'] and /takdp'-la-0an+-a/    [taykdp'la0pn+]
                 ‘stand’                stand-EXT-TR-3SG.OBJ

                 ‘stand-TR-3SG.OBJ
                 ‘of many people: stand all over it [a place]’   There is a general preference for bases to have trisyllabic feet, where possi-
ble; thus, [taykdp'la0pn+] ‘stand him/her/it up’, rather than *[taykdp'lay0n+p]. This
preference for three-syllable feet is also manifested in the next types of case.
   Most inflectional suffixes are monosyllabic. In a few cases what are histori-
cally two inflectionals suffixes are present simultaneously, a monosyllabic one
followed by a disyllabic one. The monosyllabic suffix is never stressed, while
the disyllabic one is stressed on its first syllable. In (2-45) the base is disyllabic,
and there are only two unstressed syllables next to each other.(2-46)        /0al+/ [0pl+]    and       /0al+-da-rn!a/    [0yl+ndrnp!a]
              ‘take’                      take-3PL.OBJ-“DU”
                                          ‘take them (two)’The verbal root /0al+/ and the suffix /-da/ together constitute one tri-syllabic
foot: [0yl+ndrnp!a], not *[0yl+ndprn!a].
    On the other hand, in (2-47) the base is trisyllabic, and here its last syllable
is stressed in order to avoid a sequence of three unstressed syllables:(2-47)        /aa+/ /apa:$+/    and    /aa+-da-rn!a/ [aya:$+yndrnp!a]
              confective preposition      CONF-3PL.OBJ-“DU”
24    Phonology
(Although historically /-da-rn!a/ and a few other such forms are polymor-
phemic, they are treated in this grammar as unanalyzed wholes; thus, /-darn!a/
third person dual object, third person dual personal; etc.)
   With two types of exception, the few prefixes of Toqabaqita are all disylla-
bic, and those occasion no change in the stress pattern of the stem. The first
syllable of the derived word receives stress:(2-48)      a.    /tnda/ (tr. v.) [tnpda] and /kdpa+-tnda-+/ [kdpy+tnpnd+]
                  ‘meet’                      LIP-meet-LIP

                  ‘be alive’                    CAUS-be.alive
                                                ‘save sb.’s life’ (person as direct
                                                object)    The causative prefix has two forms: /a!a-/ and /a-/. The monosyllabic
allomorph is used, optionally, only in combination with the low-inividuation-
of-participants (LIP) prefix /kdpa+/ (see (2-48a above) in a small number of verbs:
/kdpa+-a-/. For the purposes of stress assignment /kdpa+-a-/ forms one trisyl-
labic foot with the stress on the first syllable and there is no effect on the stress
pattern of the base. On the other hand, when the disyllabic form of the causa-
tive prefix is used after the LIP prefix, it receives stress on its first syllable, and
again there is no effect on the stress pattern of the base.(2-49)      /ma!7/ [mp!7]      and    /kdpa+-a-ma!7-+/      [kdpy+$mp!7+]

                                     ‘be frightening’   Monosyllabic prefixation is also found in a number of words that involve
reduplication. Reduplication by prefixation normally involves disyllabic redu-
plicants. The first syllable of the word is stressed, and so is the first syllable of
the base.(2-50)      a.    /aa-a!a-7la7/              [aya:$ay!7pl$7]

                  ‘blink repeatedly’   However, in a number of words the reduplicants are monosyllabic. The first
syllable of the word receives stress, but there is no stress on the first syllable of
the base, because two adjacent syllables cannot be stressed, except in cases of
vowel elision; see rule III further above. In (2-59d) it is the second rather than
the first syllable of the base that is stressed.(2-51)      a.    /tn-tnl+/                            [tnptnl+]

                  ‘keep on working hard’    Compare [0gdbap0gdbr+] ‘of a person: feel cold’ in (2-51b), with a monosyl-
labic reduplicant and no stress on the initial syllable of the base [0gdbr+], and
[0gdbaya:0gdbpr+!] ‘of a place: be pleasantly cool, shaded’, with a disyllabic redu-
plicant and stress on the initial syllable of the same base, [0gdbpr+]. (/-!a/ is a
proprietive suffix that derives stative intransitive verbs.) And compare also
[7y:l7lp$7] ‘keep on working hard’ in (2-51d), with a monosyllabic reduplicant
and stress on the second rather than the first syllable of the base, and
[aya:$ay!7pl$7] ‘keep on making sb. work hard’ in (2-50a) further above, with
two disyllabic prefixes and stress on the first syllable of the same base, [7pl$7],
    In compounds, each element is stressed in the same way as when it functions
as a word on its own, with a few exceptions. For example:(2-52)      a.    /aln-ma'/               [aylnmap']

                 never dries out’ (/r7ka/ ‘water spring’)   Both compounds in (2-53) below contain five syllables, but in the one in (2-
53a) the primary stress is on the third syllable, which is the initial syllable of
the second member of the compound, while in the compound in (2-53b) the
primary stress is on the fourth syllable, which is the initial syllable of the sec-
ond member of the compound:(2-53)     a.    /m''-!7la7/     [m'y':!7pl7]
                 tongue-frog.sp

                 follow-tree
                 ‘bird sp.: Common Kingfisher’   The fact that (with some exceptions discussed further below) the compo-
nents of compounds retain their lexical stress makes it possible, in principle at
least, for two compounds to be phonetically distinct only in their stress pat-
terns:. CVyCV-CVpCVCV vs CVyCVCV-CVpCV, with identical consonants and
vowels in identical positions in the two compounds. However, no such minimal
pair has come to light.
   There are a few lexicalized phrases that are exceptional to the rule that lexi-
cal items retain their stress patterns in compounds. All of them contain the
monosyllabic general locative preposition /!+/ in its variant form /+/. As a mono-
syllabic preposition, /+/ not stressed, and its presence in a compound may re-
quire an additional stress in order to avoid a sequence of three unstressed sylla-

preposition is trisyllabic. In the lexicalized phrase its last syllable receives
stress in order for three unstressed syllables in a row to be avoided:(2-55)        /mn!ns7-+-l7ma/             [mny!ns7y+l7pm] cf. [mnp!ns7]

2.4.     ReduplicationReduplication is a pervasive phenomenon in Toqabaqita with a variety of func-
tions. A number of types of reduplication patterns are distinguished in the lan-
guage on the basis of two main criteria: (a) the number of syllables redupli-
cated; (b) prefixation vs. suffixation of the reduplicant. With respect to the
prefixation vs. suffixation of the reduplicant, the relevant factor is the nature of
the first segment of the base: a consonant or a vowel. Reduplication of bases
beginning with a consonant involves prefixation of the reduplicant; reduplica-
tion of bases beginning with a vowel involves suffixation of the reduplicant.
    Normal stress rules apply to words containing reduplications. In each of the
sets of examples in (2-57) – (2-65), the first one also shows the phonetic form
with stress.
    There are three reduplication patterns of consonant-initial bases. In the
commonest pattern, the initial syllable is reduplicated and its vowel is doubled
in the reduplicant:(2-57)      a.     /lnl'/ (intr. v.)       /lnn-lnl'/         [lnyn:lnpl']
                   ‘tell a lie’            ‘keep on lying’

                   ‘make sb. work hard’   In another reduplication pattern with consonant-initial bases, it is the first
two syllables that are reduplicated. This pattern is not as common as the pre-
ceding one.(2-58)      a.     /tn7/                  /tn7-tn7/ (n.) [tny$7tnp$7]

                 ‘blink’                  ‘blink repeatedly’There are at least two bases that have the form Ca!7 where the reduplicant
lacks the glottal stop:(2-59)     a.    /gdba!7/                 /gdba7-gdba!7/     [0gdby70gdbp!7]
                 ‘be empty’               ‘of something that is normally round,
                                          convex: be flat, deflated’
           b.    /ra!7/ (tr. v.)          /ra7-ra!7-!aba/
                 ‘hold’                   ‘of two people: hold hands when

                                          other’ (/!aba/ ‘hand, arm’)   With bases of the form CViVi, reduplication can be interpreted as involving
only the first syllable of the base with the vowel doubled, or as involving both
syllables of the base:(2-60)     a.    /m77/ (intr. v.)         /m77-m77/        [m7y7:m7p7:]
                 ‘break, tear’            ‘be broken, torn

                 ‘worm’                   ‘collectivity of worms in
                                          one place’
           c.    /tnn/                    /tnn-tnn/
                 ‘stay’                   optionally used to express the
                                          frequentative aspect; also as a
                                          sequencer : ‘later’   Since those cases where the direction of reduplication is clear, as in the
commonest pattern discussed further above and in (2-58c), involve prefixation
rather than suffixation, it can be assumed that the other cases also involve pre-
fixation, as in (2-58a), (2-58b), and in (2-60).
   In the third type of reduplication of consonant-initial bases only the first
syllable is reduplicated and the reduplicant is prefixed, without doubling of the
vowel in the reduplicant. This kind of reduplication is not common.(2-61)     a.    /tnl+/ (intr. v.)        /tn-tnl+/          [tnptnl+]
                 ‘move down, descend’     ‘landslip, landslide’

                 in a village’          in a village’   Since the clear cases of reduplication of consonant-initial bases involve pre-
fixation of the reduplicant, there is no reason to assume that reduplication of
single syllables involves infixation: */tn-tn-l+/ ‘landslip, landslide’ (see [2-
61a]).
   There are two patterns of reduplication of vowel-initial bases. In one, the
more common one, the last syllable of the stem is reduplicated and the copy is
suffixed to the base:(2-62)     a.    /nl+/ (intr. v.)       /nl+-l+/       [np:l+-l+/
                 ‘return’               ‘move to and fro/back and forth’
           b.    /a7-s+/               /a7-7/ (n.)
                 ‘scatter, sprinkle’    ‘flakes, crumbs’
           c.    /n7/ (intr. v.)       /n7-7-a/

                                        ‘group, gathering, congregation’  In transitive verbs that contain a transitive suffix, the suffix follows the re-
duplicant. The reduplicant is part of a phonological foot with the base(2-63)     a.    /a0+-s+-a/         /a0+-0+-s+-a/            [ay:0+0+s+p]

                 do-TR-3SG.OBJ ‘keep imitating him/her-it’
                 ‘imitate him/her/it’    The other reduplication pattern found with vowel-initial bases applies to
words of the form VCV. There the whole of the base is reduplicated, and (by
analogy with the other pattern of reduplication of vowel-initial stems) the copy
is suffixed. In some cases, the last vowel of the base changes, either obligatorily
or optionally, to become identical to the initial vowel of the copy, which is also
the initial vowel of the base. Examples without vowel change are given in (2-
64), and examples with vowel change in (2-65).

                                          agitated rather than still’    There are also idiosyncratic cases of reduplication that do not follow any of
the patterns given above, both for consonant-initial and vowel-initial bases. For
example, /kdpara-ra/ ‘urinate’, ‘urine’ is based on /kdpara/ ‘urine’. Even though
the base is consonant-initial, it is the final syllable that is reduplicated and the
copy is suffixed. (/kdpara-ra/ is an independent word for ‘urine’, while /kdpara/
must occur with a personal suffix; for example /kdpara-k7/ ‘my urine’.)
    The deverbal noun /'n'-nn-a/ (or: /'n-'nn-a/?) ‘peace’ is based on /'nn/ ‘be
quiet, calm’. The base is disyllabic, and the expected form of the word for
‘peace’ is either */'nn-'nn-a/ or */'n'-'nn-a/. (The suffix /-a/ derives nouns
from verbs.) And there is also an intransitive verb /'n'-nn-!a/ (/'n-'nn-!a/?) ‘be
peaceful’, also based on /'nn/, which is irregular in the same way. (/-!a/ is a
proprietive suffix.)
    /7!7n7/ (intr. v., n.) ‘narrate, converse’, ‘story’ has an irregular reduplicated
counterpart of the form /7!7!7n7/ ‘keep on narrating, conversing’. While
/7!7!7n7/ appears to involve infixation of the reduplicant, it is more likely that
this synchronic irregularity is the result of an unknown historical process. Simi-
larly, /7la7/ ‘work hard’ has a reduplicated form /7l7la7/ ‘keep on working
hard’, which is irregular in the same way as /7!7!7n7/.
    Some bases have two reduplicated counterparts distinguished by different
types of reduplication. In some instances the two forms that involve reduplica-
tion are synonymous; in others there is a difference in meaning:

lichen’: /l7m7/, /l77-l7m7/, /l7m7-l7m7/, and also /r7m7/, /r77-r7m7/, /r7m7-
r7m7/. And there are corresponding variant intransitive verbs derived by means
of the proprietive suffix /-!a/, all of which mean ‘be mossy; be covered with
moss or lichen’: /l7m7-!a/, /l77-l7m7-!a/, /l7m7-l7m7-!a/, /r7m7-!a/, /r77-
r7m7-!a , and /r7m7-r7m7-!a/
   It is possible for multiple copies of the reduplicant to be added to a base.
Such multiple reduplication serves, iconically, to emphasize the temporal extent
of the state of affairs. If the reduplicant is of the form CViVi-, the second of the
two identical vowels is often lengthened beyond the usual degree of lengthen-
ing:(2-67)       /taa-taa-taa-ta!'/          [taya::taya::taya::tap!']
             RDP-RDP-RDP-ascend

cally when verbs are reduplicated to express the continuative/iterative aspect. In
other cases, the reduplicated forms are lexical items of their own that have only
a historical relation to their original bases; for example, /n++-n+7/ ‘grease (in
food)’ and /n+7/ ‘coconut’.","[48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62]"

Deranked subordinate clauses
Toqabaqita has a type of adverbial subordination where the subordinate clause
is deranked. The term “deranking” is taken from Stassen (1985), who says that
a common characteristic of deranking is “a reduction of the verbal morphology
which is normally allowed to predicates” (p. 82, original emphasis). (See also,
for example, Croft 2002 and Cristofaro 2003.) In Toqabaqita, such deranking
involves absence of a subject-tense/aspect/sequentiality/negation marker. How-
ever, if the verb in a deranked clause is transitive (and most verbs that occur in
deranked clauses are), it carries an object-marking suffix under the same condi-
tions that apply to transitive verbs elsewhere. In subordination with deranking,
the main clause comes first and the deranked clause second. There is no overt
marker of the subordination.
    Deranked clauses do not express states of affairs additional to those ex-
pressed in the main clauses. Rather, they express a characteristic or a circum-
stance of the state of affairs expressed in the main clause, as relating to one
(set) of the participants. Not infrequently, there is an implication of purpose,
but unlike in purpose subordination (discussed in section 33.3), there are not
two separate states of affairs (do X in order that Y maybe the case). Instead, the
purpose is presented as just a property of the state of affairs expressed in the
main clause.
    Clause deranking in Toqabaqita is reminiscent of constructions with con-
verbs in other languages (see Haspelmath 1995 for an overview of converbs).
They are non-finite by virtue of the absence of subject-
tense/aspect/sequentiality/negation markers. However, unlike (prototypical)
converbs, verbs in deranked clauses in Toqabaqita do not have any marking
identifying them as such. And second, only a relatively small number of verbs
can head the predicates in deranked clauses.
    While subject markers can be omitted with any verb (section 4.8), their ab-
sence is characteristic of the deranking construction discussed here. And, im-
portantly, deranked clauses do not express states of affairs separate from, or
additional to, the states of affairs expressed in their main clauses. In other cases
of omission of subject markers, the clauses do typically express separate states
of affairs.
    It is mostly transitive verbs that can occur in deranked clauses, but only a
small number of them do. There is also at least one intransitive verb that can
1214     Deranked subordinate clauses
occur in deranked clauses, in which case it obligatorily takes an oblique-object
complement. The verb in the main clause may be transitive or intransitive. The
deranked clause has no expression of the subject, whether by means of a sub-
ject marker or a subject noun phrase. The notional subject of a deranked clause
is normally coreferential with the subject or the direct object of the main
clause; but see (36-21). On the other hand, the direct object or, in the case of
the intransitive verb, the oblique object in a deranked clause is not co-
referential with any noun phrase of the main clause. That is, the deranked
clause adds an argument to the overall frame of the main-deranked clause com-
plex. The verb in the deranked clause occurs clause-initially.
    Constructions with deranked adverbial clauses must be distinguished from
serializing [verb verb] compounds (section 12.5). In [verb verb] compounds the
constituent verbs must be contiguous, and if the first verb is Class 1 transitive,
it cannot carry an object suffix. Second, the verbs in [verb verb] compounds are
prosodically integrated with each other: there is (normally) no pause between
them. And third, when both verbs in a [verb verb] compound are (notionally)
transitive, the two verbs must share their subjects and direct objects; that is, the
second verb cannot introduce an additional argument. It is the compound as a
lexical unit that has a (unified) argument structure. On the other hand, in subor-
dination with clause deranking, some of the material in the main clause may
intervene between the two verbs: postverbal particles, direct objects and
oblique objects. Second, there may be a pause between the main and the
deranked clause, and there may be a slight rise in intonation at the end of the
main clause, just as is the case with other kinds of complex sentences. How-
ever, such pausing and rise in intonation does not always happen in subordina-
tion with deranking, especially if the overall sentence is relatively short. And
third, as mentioned above, the verb in a deranked clause supplies an argument
not associated with the verb in the main clause, even if the verb in the main
clause is transitive. The two verbs occur in different clauses, and each one has
its own argument structure. Examples of [verb verb] compounds that involve
verbs that can also occur in deranked clauses are given below.
    One of the verbs that can occur in deranked clauses is the Class 1 transitive
verb kali ‘move around st., sb.; be positioned around st., sb.; surround’. The
first example shows it in a relative clause, without deranking:(36-1)      Sulufau    n=e                 kali-a             biqu      naqi

coreferential with the subject of the main clause, but its direct object era ‘fire’
is not shared with the main clause. The limiting particle ba-miliqa intervenes
between the two verbs.","[1264, 1265, 1266, 1267, 1268]"

pound or with the topicalization of the possessor but employ neither are gram-
matical, but they are not very common. They may be used if, for example, the
sentence has a different topic. In (12-28) the topic is the man, and the sentence
employs a subject-incorporating compound:(12-28)    Wane     naqi qe             seqe-daadaola          qasia naqa.

sents the topic, and the sentence employs neither the compound seqe-daadaola

12.3.3. Object-incorporating [noun verb] compoundsThis type of compounding is severely restricted lexically. Compounds of this
type are endocentric and they are nouns. The modifying verb is transitive, but
only Class I transitive verbs participate in such compounds. In fact, almost all
the verbs that occur in such compounds are bare transitives. The verb carries
the third person (singular) object suffix -a, regardless of the grammatical num-
ber of the noun phrase headed by the compound. This suffix is used on Class 1
transitive verbs in verb phrases to index their lexical objects, also regardless of
the grammatical number of the object (section 4.2.3.2.1). However, while in a
verb phrase the order is [verb direct.object], in object-incorporating compounds
of this type the order is [noun verb].
    One verb that occurs in an object-incorporating [noun verb] compound is
thare ‘bear (a child, young), give birth to’; ‘of female and male human parents:
beget’; also ‘feed’; ‘give food to’; ‘provide food for’; and ‘keep domestic and
pet animals’. In (12-30) the verb functions as the head of a verb phrase:(12-30)    … roo     wela      inomae           kero
             two     child     be.orphaned      3DU.NFUT           thare-a           teqe botho.
           keep.animal-3.OBJ one pig
           ‘… two orphaned children kept a pig.’   In an object-incorporating compound, thare-a occurs with wela ‘child’ as
the head and the compound has the meaning ‘fostered (lit.: fed) child’. In (12-
31a) the compound is singular and in (12-31b) it is marked for the plural num-
ber. In both cases the verb carries the object suffix -a.(12-31) a.    wela thare-a                      b.    wela thare-a        ki

            ‘k.o. personal basket carried slung from the shoulder’(The meaning of taru-fi is ‘carry a personal basket, bag suspended on one's
body’; for example, carry a personal basket slung from one's shoulder, or carry
a backpack on one's back.)
12.4.     Object-incorporating [verb noun] compounds12.4.1. IntroductionThere are three subtypes of object-incorporating compounds: (i) compounds
that are intransitive verbs, (ii) compounds that are Class 2 transitive verbs, and
(iii) compounds that are nouns.
    With some provisos to be discussed further below, verbs that enter into this
type of compound exist as transitive verbs, but, with one exception, only Class
1 transitive verbs do. As transitive verbs, when they occur in a verb phrase,
they index their lexical objects by the third person (singular) object sufix, re-
gardless of the grammatical number of the object. However, when such verbs
occur in object-incorporating compounds, the verb in the compound cannot
carry an object suffix. In the case of compounds that are intransitive verbs,
there is no object suffix because the compound verb is intransitive. In the case
of compounds that are Class 2 transitive verbs, there is an object suffix, but it is
attached to the compound as a whole, not to the constituent verb. Second, noth-
ing can intervene between the verb and the noun in such compounds. Postverbal
particles can only come after a compound. And third, nouns in the direct-object
position can have modifiers and can carry personal suffixes, but the nouns in
compounds can have neither. These differences between verbs and their direct
objects on the one hand and object-incorporating compounds on the other are
illustrated by the next three pairs of examples. In (12-41) the verb carries the
object suffix -a, the precedentive particle comes between the verb and the di-
rect object, and the direct-object noun carries a personal suffix:

           1SG 1SG.FUT brush-3.OBJ        PREC tooth-1SG.PERS
           ‘I’m going to brush my teeth now.’   In broadly synonymous (12-42) the verb-noun combination is an intransitive
verb. There is no object suffix, the precedentive particle comes after the verb-
noun combination, and the noun does not, and cannot, carry the personal suffix.","[587, 588, 589, 590, 591]"
"
16.2.     Other uses of the sequential markers in positive clausesIn their central function the sequential subject markers signal that the onset of
the situation of their clause follows the onset of the situation expressed in a
preceding clause. This also appears to be the case in the next example, although
most likely it is not. There the speaker recounts his visit to a zoo and uses a
number of sequential clauses. The visit had taken place a number of years pre-
viously, and it is highly unlikely that the order of the clauses corresponds ex-
actly to the order in which he had seen the animals. Rather, the order of the
clauses reflects the order in which the speaker’s recollection unfolds.",[780]
"
39.2.    The formal propertiesRelative clauses and the presupposition domain of the focus construction re-
ceive the same marking, na. Na frequently fuses with immediately following
subject markers whose full forms begin with q, in which case the focus marker
has the form n= and the glottal stop of the subject marker drops out; for exam-
ple n=e from na qe, with the third person singular nonfuture subject marker qe,
as in (39-7) above.
    While there are other parallels between constructions with relative clauses
and the focus construction, especially when it comes to the indexing of the fo-
cus constituent in the presupposition domain (see further below), there are also
differences. First, relative clauses are modifiers of nouns. On the other hand,
focused constituents may be not just noun phrases, but also clauses and even a
marker of inter-propositional relations. Second, as noun-phrase internal modifi-
                                                  39.2 The formal properties   1273ers, relative clauses always occur within a higher clause, whereas the clauses in
the presupposition domain need not. The focus construction freely occurs in
simple clauses, without subordination or coordination. And third, even though
na as a focus marker may be omitted (see examples [39-34] and [39-35] below,
this happens only rarely, whereas the relative-clause marking na is absent more
commonly.
    The constituent in focus often receives some prosodic prominence, which
falls on its last (or sole) phonological word. The level of stress is somewhat
higher than it would be otherwise, and the word is given higher pitch than it
would receive otherwise. And there may be a slight pause between the end of
the focus constituent and the focus marker.
    Noun phrases in focus may be lexical or pronominal. Pronouns are com-
monly used in the focus position even if the referent is inanimate; see (39-13)
and (39-31) further below, and (6-75) in section 6.3.2.
    The phrase, clause, or grammatical element in focus is not a syntactic con-
stituent of the presupposition domain; and, with the exception of verbless
clauses, where the focus phrase is not indexed, the presupposition domain is
grammatically self-contained.
    In the discussion that follows, the various structural subtypes of the focusing
construction are discussed and illustrated. Terms such as “subject focusing”,
“direct-object focusing”, etc. are used as convenient shorthand expressions for
“focusing where the constituent in focus corresponds, respectively, to the sub-
ject, direct object, etc. of the presupposition clause”.
    With two types of exception, noun phrases in focus are indexed in the pre-
supposition domain. One type of exception is verbless sentences. Either the
subject or the predicate phrase can be in focus, but neither is indexed. The other
exception is temporal phrases, which are not normally indexed. Clauses in fo-
cus are not indexed either, nor is the marker of inter-propositional relations.
Otherwise, the conditions on the indexing of focused noun phrases in the pre-
supposition clauses are the same as those for the indexing of the positions rela-
tivized in relative clauses; see sections 30.6 and 4.9 for detail.
    In subject focusing the focus phrase is indexed in the presupposition clause
by means of the appropriate subject marker, if the clause contains a verb. This
is illustrated in (39-4) (and [39-5]) in section 39.1 for lexical focus phrases, and
in (39-8) below for a pronominal focus phrase. As is generally the case when
the referent of a pronoun is foregrounded, pronominal noun phrases in focus
often, although not always, contain the foregrounding particle ni (section 6.3.2).","[1325, 1326]"

           ‘They know my child and me.’    If the order were kamareqa wela nau ‘me and my child’, with the inlusory
pronominal coming first, the construction would be ungrammatical. The un-
grammaticality of inclusory constructions where it is the inclusory pronoun that
comes next to the verb can be explained by appeal to the proximity principle. A
Class 2 transitive verb must carry an object suffix and cannot have a pronoun as
its direct object. If the inclusory pronoun occurred next to the verb, there would
be a clash between the object suffix and the object pronoun: *thaitoqoma-
mareqa kamareqa wela nau ‘know-1DU(EXCL).OBJ 1DU(EXCL) child 1SG’. The

their objects, and between possessum nouns and the possessor phrases. For the
clash between a personal suffix on a possessum noun and a pronoun in the pos-
sessor position see (14-20) further below.
   Examples (14-19) and (14-20) below contain inclusory constructions in the
possessor position. In (14-19) the included NP comes before the inclusory pro-
noun, and the construction is grammatical. The possessum noun manta
‘thought’ carries the third person “singular” personal suffix, used elsewhere in
the suffixing possessive construction when the possessor is lexical. That is, the
proximity principle applies here.","[691, 692]"

           day this
           ‘The two of us too will go together in order to see the thing that the
           people will talk about today.’    There is no semantic difference between the variants with and without the
object suffix. It is possible that the two subordinators are in the process of los-
ing the verb-like property of taking the object suffix. As discussed in section
10.3.1, all the verb-like prepositions have innovative, reduced forms which are
also unlike verbs, although there the original object suffix has been incorpo-
rated into the prepositions themselves: ura, fasa, sula, etc. The forms uri and
suli, used with reason clauses, also have reduced variants ura and sula, respec-
tively, although these are used only rarely; see section 33.2 for examples.
    The reason- and purpose-marking form uri and the reason-marking form suli
may be accompanied by the complementizer na (section 29.3), although this is
not very common. The complementizer immediately follows uri or suli, and is
itself followed by the reason or the purpose clause. This is likely to be due to
1138     Reason and purpose clauses
uri and suli deriving historically from erstwhile transitive verbs that, presuma-
bly, could take complement clauses as their direct objects. With suli, the use of
the complementizer is less common than with uri (in either function of the lat-
ter). When the complementizer is present, suli and uri take the object suffix -a.
That is, the constructions with these two subordinators exhibit properties of
certain verbal constructions with complement clauses: the clause is indexed
with the object suffix and the complementizer may be present (sections 29.2.1
and 29.3).
   In (33-7) uri-a and the complementizer introduce a reason clause:(33-7)      ... ruuruqu-da        ka      leqa    qasia          naqa

            ‘... they felt very happy (lit.: their chests were very good) because

the complementizer:(33-8)      … nia ka      lae         ka      manta      uri-a          na

            small speaker, or even a microphone; and there was not even a gui-
            tar.’   Lexical and pronominal phrases are not normally combined in disjunctive
coordination in argument positions. Instead, disjunctive phrases are placed in
clauses as adjuncts, the referents being encoded in an argument position jointly
by a subject marker or by an object marker. In (11-35) they are encoded jointly
by means of the plural object suffix on the comitative preposition. The refer-
ence of the object suffix is made clear by the following disjunctive phrase:(11-35)     Tei na  qoki    lae               bii-da,           kamiliqa  mada

11.3.     Prepositional-phrase coordinationCoordination of prepositional phrases can be of the conjunctive or the disjunc-
tive type. Conjunctive coordination is discussed first. In conjunctive coordina-
tion, only the conjunction ma ‘and’ can be used, which is also used to coordi-
nate noun phrases (and clauses and sentences). The other coordinators used in
conjunctive noun-phrase coordination, bia and bii, do not function as coordina-
tors of prepositional phrases. Ma is optional, although usually present, espe-
cially in binary coordination.
    Example (11-36) contains binary coordination:(11-36)     Wane     araqi      ki ma            ai    biqi baqita          ki

           just/recently big) that run [here: jog] on that road in the mornings
           and in the evenings.’   In (11-37) the coordinator is absent from binary coordination:(11-37)    … tai     kini  ki na  keki     qono ura
             some.PL woman PL FOC 3PL.IPFV sit  PURP           qegwe-la-na,                        uri-a

           ‘[When canarium nuts are processed, the men crack them open
           (and)] it is some (of the) women who sit [there] to extract the ker-

           [containers].’ (Lit.: ‘… it is some women who sit for extracting the
           kernels out of them, for putting them in ongi bamboo.’)   Disjunctive coordination is discussed next. There the conjunction mada ‘or’
is used, which also serves to coordinate noun phrases (and clauses). Mada is
obligatory. The next two examples contain disjunctive coordination:(11-38)    … uri-a         kwai      raa   i        Kilufi   mada    i

            ‘… they went [out] simply through the middle of the fence or per-

11.4.     Noun-phrase apposition and prepositional-phrase appositionIn apposition, as the term is used here, two, or more, phrases that are referen-
tially non-distinct are juxtaposed, without a coordinator. In apposition, the
phrase(s) after the first one supplies/supply additional, clarifying, elaborating,
or correcting information about the entity or the type of entity encoded by the
first phrase. The two or more appositive phrases are normally separate intona-
tion units, indicated by commas in the examples. The first four examples illus-
trate noun-phrase apposition, which is more common than prepositional-phrase
apposition:(11-40)     Nia   ka      lae     bo=naqa buria-na        wane

            ‘They really harmed the (lit.: these) people on this island, Malaita,
            ….’   In (11-42) the second noun phrase clarifies the reference of the personal
pronoun with which it is in apposition:(11-42)     … ta   fai, ta   lima wane biqi baqita              bii
              some four some five man IMM be.big                COM            kamiliqa, ta      fai wane baqita naqa.

          ‘… Mata, Joy’s husband, the policeman, told me ….’   The next example contains prepositional-phrase apposition, where the sec-
ond prepositional phrase has a disjunctive coordinate noun phrase as its com-
plement:(11-44)   ... ma    kuka            toli-ngi           nia    qan=ta

Compounding
12.1.   IntroductionToqabaqita has a large variety of types of compounds. On the basis of their
constituents, the following main types can be distinguished in the language:
[noun noun], [noun verb], [verb noun], and [verb verb] compounds. There are
both endocentric and exocentric compounds, and both root and synthetic com-
pounds. With one minor type of exception, all endocentric compounds are left-
headed. Apart from the major compounding types, there are also some minor
types, and also idiosyncratic compounds. And besides compounds, there are
lexicalized phrases, which too are discussed in this chapter.
    The only phonological characteristic that may be indicative of a word being
a compound is stress. As discussed in section 2.3, in words with more than one
stressed syllable the final stress tends to be stronger than the preceding
stress(es). So, for example the word alo ‘taro’ would be stressed [apln] when not
in a compound, whereas it would normally receive secondary stress as the first
constituent in the compound [aylnmap'] (alo-mae ‘taro’-‘die’) ‘blight that affects
taro plants’.
    The following conventions are employed in writing compounds. Compounds
that are irregular, semantically or formally, are written as one word. Included
here are [verb noun] compounds that are Class 2 transitive verbs. All other
compounds are written as separate words, with one type of exception. Com-
pounds that carry affixes that apply to the compound as a whole are written as
one word to show that the affix applies to the whole compound. This applies to
nominalizations and deverbal nouns formed from compound verbs; for exam-
ple, abula taqaa (‘behave’ ‘be.bad’) ‘behave badly’, but abula-taqaa-laa ‘be-
having badly’, with the nominalizing suffix -laa; and alu wane (‘bury’ ‘per-
son’) ‘bury (dead) people’ but alu-wane-a ‘burial’, with the the deverbal-noun
forming suffix -a. Similarly, compounds that carry other affixes are written as
one word; for example, lofo-qaba-ku (‘inner.side’-‘hand’-1SG.PERS) ‘my (hand)
palm’; cf. the synonymous possessive noun phrase lofo-na qaba-ku ‘the palm of
my hand’ (with the third person possessive suffix -na). Lexicalized phrases are
written as separate words, unless they are highly idiosyncratic semantically
and/or formally.
552      Compounding
   There are also compound-like words where only one of the elements exists
as a word in the language today; for example, utarodo (n.) ‘rain at night’, cf.
rodo night. There is no related word uta, but cf. Proto-Oceanic *qunsa ‘rain’, of
which uta would be a regular reflex in Toqabaqita.
   Some compounds function purely as lexemes, the way non-compound lex-
emes do. But certain types of compound fulfill an information-packaging func-
tion. Specifically, they permit the backgrounding of a participant.
12.2.    [noun noun] compoundsWith a very small number of exceptions, all [noun noun] compounds are them-
selves nouns. This type of compound may be endocentric or exocentric.","[575, 576, 577, 578, 579, 580, 581]"

            ‘Oh, and now we’ll eat.’ ‘Oh, and now let’s eat.’   And the sentence in (20-37) is intended as a third-person imperative:(20-37)     Wela     naqi ki keki       fanga.
            child    this PL 3PL.FUT eat
            ‘The children will/should/must eat.’
20.3.     Negative imperativesThere are two basic grammatical strategies to express negative imperatives, but
only one is normally used in present-day Toqabaqita; the other one is archaic.
The latter type of construction is referred to as “dehortative”.
852    Imperatives
20.3.1. Negative imperatives in present-day ToqabaqitaIn the present-day language, negative imperatives are expressed by means of
the same negative strategies used in declarative sentences, using the negative
subject markers (chapter 17). Both the simple and the double negative construc-
tions, the latter employing the negative verb aqi, occur in imperatives. The dou-
ble negative strategy is somewhat more emphatic than the simple strategy. The
next two examples illustrate the simple and the double constructions, respec-
tively:(20-38)    Qosi     waela qani nau.
           2SG.NEG laugh      GENP 1SG
           ‘Don’t laugh at me.’(20-39)    Qe=aqi             mosi         kwai-talami.
           3SG.NFUT=NEGV 2DU.NEG           LIP-interrupt
           ‘Don’t interrupt each other.’    Negative imperatives too can be used with a variety of illocutionary forces,
such as orders and commands (as in the two examples just above), advice,
warnings, requests, entreaties, dehortations, and dissuasions. They can be used
either to prevent a new state of affairs from coming about or to stop a state of
affairs that already exists or that has existed previously. In the latter type of
case, the verb is often reduplicated when the state of affairs has existed for a
relatively extended period of time or when it has occurred on multiple occa-
sions previously. (Reduplication of verbs serves to express the continu-
ative/iterative aspect; see section 15.2.3.) Like positive imperatives, negative
imperatives are most common with second-person subjects, but subjects of
other grammatical persons are possible as well. Examples (20-40) – (20-44)
have second-person subjects.","[904, 905]"

                                   33.3 Purpose clauses and nominalizations   1159   In imperatives, the subject marker in the second clause may be sequential,
nonfuture, rather than future, or there may be no subject marker at all in sec-
ond-person imperatives. (See section 20.2 for the use of subject markers in
positive imperatives.) Compare (33-65) just above, with a future-tense subject
marker, and (33-66) below, with a sequential subject marker:(33-66)    Lae moka         fanga       naqa.
           go 2DU.SEQ eat               PRF
           ‘Go (and) eat now.’   In (33-67) the subject marker in the exhortative purpose clause is nonfuture:(33-67)    Lae kulu                 qili   nguda.
           go PL(INCL).NFUT dig            crab.spp.
           ‘Let’s go crab-digging.’   In second-person imperatives, where there is normally no subject marker
present with any verb (section 20.2.1.2), even the verb in the second, purpose
clause may lack a subject marker:(33-68)    Lae riki-a        kuki        baa.
           go see-3.OBJ saucepan that
           ‘Go see [here: check] the saucepan.’ (Is it boiling now?)   Alternatively, the purpose clause may have the sequential subject marker:(33-69)    Lae qoko           thamataqi.
           go 2SG.SEQ         prepare.sleeping.place
           ‘Go (and) get the sleeping place/bed ready.’   In the absence of a purpose marker, a purpose relation between states of
affair is only implied (and inferred). And clearly, the relation between an event
of going expressed in one clause and the event expressed in the immediately
following clause need not be one of purpose. In (33-70) below, the verb ‘go’ in
the first clause has neither a subject marker nor a subject phrase, but the events
expressed in the two clauses are in a simple temporal sequence, not in a pur-
pose relation. In the overall situation, the speaker did not go in order to see the
pool, because he did not even know at the outset that he was going to see a
pool.

             ‘I went and saw a pool (there).’ In the given context, not ‘I went to
             see a pool.’
33.3.4. Negative-purpose clausesThere are several ways in which negative purpose ([do something] in order that
a certain state of affairs may not obtain) is signalled. The most common one by
far uses the timitive marker ada in its preventive precautionary function. This
function is discussed in more detail and exemplified in section 18.6.3, and here
only a brief summary is given. When ada is used, the negative-purpose clause
is grammatically positive, and the subject marker is always sequential. The
(notional) subject of the first clause and the subject of the purpose clause may
be identical or different.","[1211, 1212, 1213]"

4.2.3.2.5.      Causative verbs formed by means of faqa-As discussed in the preceding section, some Class 1 causative verbs are formed
by means of the short and the long transitive suffixes, and there are also causa-
tive verbs that are bare transitives. Another way to form causative verbs is by
means of a causative prefix, sometimes in combination with the short or the
long transitive suffix. The basic form of the causative prefix is faqa-. Compare
the noncausative verb waela ‘laugh’ in (4-128) and the causative faqa-waela
‘make laugh’ in (4-129):(4-128)      Wela qe            waela.

             man     3SG.NFUT CAUS-laugh-3.OBJ child 3SG.PERS
             ‘The man made his child laugh.’    Similarly (4-130) contains noncausative feda ‘be tired’ and (4-131) causa-
tive faqa-feda ‘make tired’:(4-130)      Nau ku             feda qasia naqa.
             1SG 1SG.NFUT be.tired INTS INTS

             ‘I worked and worked, and the work made me very tired.’   When the base to which the causative prefix is added begins with q (glottal
stop), the form of the prefix is optionally faa-

                  ‘make wealthy’              ‘make wealthy’   Alternatively, and more commonly, before a base that begins with faqa- the
final a of the prefix is dropped and the q of the prefix and the q of the base are
realized as a long glottal stop.(4-133)    a.     faq-qakwa          [à!:ákdpa]
                  CAUS-be.cured

                  CAUS-be.wealthy
                  ‘make wealthy’   Realization of the causative prefix as /a!a/ before a base that begins with a
glottal stop is not common and is normally found only in slow, measured
speech.
   The causative prefix can only be added to intransitive verbs, be they stative
or non-stative. The subject of the intransitive verb corresponds to the direct
object of the causative verb. Examples of causative verbs with stative bases are
given in (4-134) and examples with non-stative bases are given in (4-135). Only
the faqa- form of the prefix is given.(4-134)           intransitive              causative          a.      biliqa                    faqa-biliqa

ways, from the basic pattern faqa-intransitive.verb. With some verbs, not only
the causative prefix, but also a transitive suffix — short or long — is added to
the source verb. In some cases two synonymous variants exist, one without a
transitive suffix, and one with:(4-136)          intransitive                   causative          a.     funu                           faqa-funu-qi

                                                ‘make clean; cleanse’    There are a few causative verbs with the prefix faqa- which do not have
intransitive counterparts in present-day Toqabaqita. In the absence of historical
evidence it is impossible to tell whether these synchronic irregularities are the
110    The verb phrase
result of loss of an intransitive verb or whether those verbs were irregular when
they were first formed. For example, there is a causative verb faqa-thata ‘give a
name to, bestow a name on (esp. a child)’, but there is no corresponding intran-
sitive verb, only a noun, thata ‘name’. There is a causative verb faqa-oome
‘provoke sb.’ but no verb *oome. However, there is a noun oomea ‘enemy’,
‘fight, war’, which may historically be a deverbal noun *oome-a (section 9.2).
And there is a causative verb faqa-qafe-tani/faqa-qafe-taqi ‘make it difficult to
deal with st.; create obstacles to st. being done’ and an intransitive verb qafe-
taqi ‘be difficult to do, difficult to cope with, difficult to do st. about’, but no
*qafetani. The existence of the variant faqa-qafe-tani suggests that qafetaqi
was originally a long transitive verb, *qafe-taqi, and as such had the variant
qafe-tani.
    There are several cases of verbs that carry the prefix faqa-, which, however,
are intransitive verbs. In some cases there are also transitive verbs with the
prefix, and so the intransitive forms are most likely instances of conversion. For
example, besides transitive faqa-waela ‘make sb. laugh’ there is intransitive
faqa-waela ‘be a funny person; make other people laugh’; cf. waela (intr.)
‘laugh’. And besides the transitive variants faqa-futa and faqa-futa-ngani ‘of a
woman: give birth to’, there is intransitive faqa-futa ‘bear a child, give birth’;
cf. futa ‘be born’. However, in some cases an intransitive verb with the prefix
faqa- has no transitive counterpart. For example, there is intransitive faqa-rake-
qiri ‘make angry’ with the person made angry expressed as an oblique object,
and there is another intransitive verb rake-qiri ‘be, get angry’, which is a sub-
ject-incorporating compound (section 12.3.2): rake ‘belly’, qiri ‘be angry’. And
there is intransitive faqa-sobo ‘eat’, besides short transitive sobo-ngi ‘support,
prop up’, also metaphorially ‘eat’ (direct object coreferential with subject; lit.:
‘prop oneself up’) and intransitive sobo ‘take over from sb. in carrying st. in
order to help them out’; but there is no transitive *faqa-sobo.
    There is one verb with the prefix faqa- which is formally highly irregular. It
is an intransitive verb, and it contains two instances of the prefix faqa- or, al-
ternatively, one instance of the prefix may be realized as fa-. The variant fa-
also occurs with another verb with the same base intransitive verb, but with no
other verb in the language. This irregular verb is a member of the following set
of forms:(4-137) a.        maqu ‘be afraid’          b.      faqa-maqu (tr.) ‘frighten’          c.      faqa-maqu (intr.) ‘be great in quantity, degree’, also used as
                  an intensifier after other verbs

                 (depatientive verb; see section 21.4)          e.     faqa-kwai-faqa-maqu-i, also faqa-kwai-fa-maqu-i ‘be fright-
                 ening’, synonymous with kwai-faqa-maqu-i/kwai-fa-maqu-i    Kwai- and -i in (4-137d) and (4-137e) are low-individuation-of-participants
(LIP) affixes (section 21.3). They form intransitive, depatientive verbs from
transitive ones: kwai-faqa-maqu-i ‘be frightening’ is based on transitive, causa-
tive faqa-maqu ‘frighten’ (see [4-137b]). And this intransitive verb in turn takes
another instance of the prefix faqa-, the resulting verb faqa-kwai-faqa-maqu-i
also being intransitive. Whether there ever was a transitive verb faqa-kwai-
faqa-maqu-i is impossible to tell.
    In faqa-kwai-faqa-maqu-i one instance of faqa- follows and one precedes
the kwai- prefix. There is evidence from other verbs that the causative prefix
and the depatientive LIP prefix can occur in either order, although there are only
a few words in which the two prefixes cooccur. In some, the order is CAUS-LIP-
base. The LIP prefix derives an intransitive verb from a transitive base, and the
causative prefix derives a different transitive verb:(4-138)    a.     karangi (intr.) ‘be close, near’           b.     karangi (tr.) ‘be, move near to; approach’           c.    kwai-karangi (intr.) ‘become near(er), close(r), ‘approach’           d.    faqa-kwai-karangi (tr.), also faqa-karangi (tr.) ‘move an event

           RDP-eat-DVN      this
           ‘Let’s just bring the (time of the) feast closer.’   In other verbs the order is LIP-CAUS-base. The causative prefix derives a
transitive verb from an intransitive base, and the LIP prefix derives another in-
transitive verb:

           makes (people) live.’ (Lit.: ‘A doctor [is] a person of causing to be
           alive.’)    As far as the semantics of causative verbs derived by means of faqa- is con-
cerned, there are three main kinds of situation they express, although the dis-
tinctions are not always clear-cut, and although there are also verbs that do not
fit into any of the three categories: (i) direct, immediate causation; (ii) indirect
causation; and (iii) instructive, assistive causation.
    In direct, immediate causation there is typically physical contact between
the causer and the causee, often resulting in a change of the causee’s state:(4-142) a.        faqa-gwina ‘make wet; moisten’; cf. gwina ‘be wet’          b.      faqa-iana ‘make pregnant; impregnate’; cf. iana ‘be preg-

                  lem)’; cf. kokoto ‘be straight’, ‘be correct, proper’   In indirect causation the causer does something which has an effect on the
causee without there being physical contact, manipulation. Sometimes the
causer acts only verbally.(4-143) a.        faqa-oli-fani ‘send sb. back’; cf. oli ‘return’          b.      faqa-bona ‘make sb. quiet; hush sb.’; cf. bona ‘be quiet, si-
                  lent; not speak’          c.      faqa-toqowane ‘give one’s daughter away in a marriage cere-
                  mony’; cf. toqowane ‘of a woman: be, get married’

                  industrious woman making her husband wealthy through her
                  hard work)   In instructive, assistive causation the causer instructs the causee in perform-
ing an activity, teaches him/her how to perform an activity.(4-144) a.       faqa-fale ‘teach sb. (esp. a child) to give (things to others), to
                 be generous’; cf. fale (intr.) ‘give’, also fale (tr.) ‘give’ (theme
                 as direct object)         b.       faqa-raa ‘teach sb. how to work, instruct sb. in work’; cf. raa
                  (intr.) ‘work’         c.       faqa-foqa ‘teach sb. how to pray’, ‘make sb. into a (tradi-
                  tional) priest’; cf. foqa ‘pray’         d.       faqa-ngata ‘encourage sb. to speak (e.g. by asking them ques-

                 ‘walk’, ‘pass by’.","[136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142]"

"    Although in (4-1) the arrangement of the constituents is given in a simple
linear form, there is layered structure. Other than the verb, all the other con-
stituents are grammatically optional. A verb alone can constitute a verb phrase:(4-2)       Sifo!

stituents. The layering within the verb phrase is indicated by means of the
raised roman numerals. A verb phrase type that contains a modifier with a cer-
tain numeral is included within a verb phrase type with a modifier with a higher
numeral. For example, a verb phrase that contains a subject marker (superscript
II) and a pronominal direct object (superscript III) has the structure given in (4-
3):(4-3)       [[subject.marker verb] pronominal.direct.object]   And a verb phrase that contains the irrealis marker (superscript IX), a sub-
ject marker (superscript II), and one or more postverbal particles (superscript
IV) has the structure given in (4-4):(4-4)       [irrealis [[subject.marker verb] postverbal.particle(s)]]    For convenience, the verb and the preverbal and the postverbal particles will
be referred to collectively as the “verb complex”. Note that this term is used for
descriptive convenience; it does not identify a syntactic constituent. (The pre-
verbal and the postverbal particles have different superscripts in [4-1].) Direct
objects that are realized by means of independent personal pronouns also are
inside the verb complex. Such objects come directly after the verb, before any
of the postverbal particles. Lexical direct objects, on the other hand, come after
all the postverbal particles and are outside the verb complex. Compare the posi-
tion of the pronominal object before the perfect and the andative postverbal
particles in (4-5) and the position of the lexical object after these particles in (4-
6). The verb complexes are in square brackets. Both sentences consist solely of
verb phrases. There are no subject noun phrases, the subject being encoded
only by means of the third person plural nonfuture subject marker kera.","[83, 84]"

5.2.10.2.   The self-benefactive constructionIn the self-benefactive construction, the personal suffix on qa- or one of the
other relevant particles indexes the referent of the subject of the clause. The
200    The particles in the verb complex
basic meaning of the self-benefactive construction is some kind of beneficial
effect on the referent of the subject: the referent of the subject brings about a
state of affairs for his/her/its own benefit, in his/her/its own interest. The kind
of benefit or interest involved may be quite subtle and not necessarily obvious
to an outsider without some knowledge of the context. In most cases, the bene-
ficiary is human or at least animate; however, the self-benefactive construction
can also occur with inanimate subjects. In some, though not all, cases such in-
animate subjects are treated, metaphorically, as animate or human.
    In the situation expressed in (5-128) it was in the people’s (prisoners’) inter-
est to pretend they were near death in order to be treated better:(5-128)    ... kera         lole      qa-da      qana            mae-a ....

           ‘They take (good) care of themselves.’    In (5-130) the self-benefactive marker is present in A’s sentence and in the
first clause of B’s sentence, but not in the second clause of B’s sentence, where
it would be odd (indicated by “#”): while bathing is normally beneficial, being
busy is not.","[228, 229]"

Constructions with inclusory pronominals
14.1.    Two basic typesInclusory pronominals are pronominals that denote a set of participants, larger
than one, a subset of which is denoted by a separate lexical noun phrase. The
term “pronominals” is used here as a cover term for independent personal pro-
nouns and various “dependent” pronominal forms, namely the subject markers,
the object-indexing suffixes, and the personal suffixes. Inclusory pronominals
are defined by their function; they are not special pronominal forms distinct
from other independent pronouns and dependent pronominals. (And “inclu-
sory” is not the same as “inclusive”.)
   In (14-1) the first person dual exclusive independent pronoun functions as
an inclusory pronominal/pronoun. It denotes a set of two individuals, one of
whom is denoted by the following noun phrase doqora-ku ‘my sibling’:(14-1)     Kamareqa doqora-ku         meki                     lae
           1DU(EXCL) sibling-1SG.PERS 1DU(EXCL).FUT            go           ma=i         qusungadi.
           VENT=LOC     tomorrow
           ‘I and my brother will come tomorrow.’ (Lit.: ‘The two of us my
           brother, we two will come tomorrow.’)    Following Singer (2001), the total set of participants is referred to as the
“superset”. In (14-1) the superset consists of two people, the speaker and his
brother. The noun phrase that denotes a subset of the superset is referred to as
the “included noun phrase”, doqora-ku ‘my sibling’ in (14-1). As discussed in
section 14.2.1, in constructions such as the one in (14-1) the inclusory pro-
nominal, which encodes the superset, and the included NP form a noun phrase.
Such inclusory constructions are referred to as “phrasal”.
    A different type of inclusory construction occurs in (14-2). In that sentence
there is no independent personal pronoun with an inclusory function. Rather, it
is the dual subject marker that functions as an inclusory pronominal and de-
notes the superset.
656      Constructions with inclusory pronominals
(14-2)       Doqora-ku        meki                  lae   ma=i

             tomorrow
             ‘My brother and I will come tomorrow.’    In (14-2) the included NP and the inclusory subject marker do not form a
phrase. The included NP is the subject, whereas the subject marker is part of
the verb phrase. Inclusory constructions where the inclusory pronominal and
the included NP do not form a phrase are referred to as “split”. Note that in the
context of split inclusory constructions, the term “construction” does not sig-
nify a syntactic phrase.
    In the split construction in (14-2) there is no agreement in person and num-
ber between the subject noun phrase, which is third person singular, and the
subject marker, which is first person dual exclusive. This is discussed in section
14.3.2.
    In some syntactic positions, both phrasal and split inclusory constructions
are possible. In (14-1) and (14-2) the two types of construction occur in subject
position. In some other positions, only the phrasal type of inclusory construc-
tion is possible.
    The inclusory constructions are not used where the inclusory pronominal
would be inclusive. The referential range of the inclusive forms includes the
addressee(s). The speaker-addressee dyad is the basic unit of linguistic interac-
tion (see, for example, Brown and Levinson [1987]), and in such cases there is
no need for an included NP to specify a subset of the superset. The included NP
would denote the addressee. It is possible for one or more other persons, be-
sides the speaker and the addressee, to form a set to which a state of affairs
applies: ‘X and you and me’.36 Nevertheless, in such cases the inclusory con-
struction is not used either. This is probably due to an extension of the ban on
inclusory constructions with inclusive pronominals from the basic dyadic con-
dition.
    The inclusory constructions are used only with reference to human partici-
pants.
    The Toqabaqita inclusory constructions are discussed in a cross-linguistic
context in Lichtenberk (2000a). Following the terminology employed there,
they are of the “implicit” kind: there is no overt marking of the inclusory rela-
tion between the inclusory pronominal and the included NP.
    Phrasal inclusory constructions are discussed first, and split constructions
subsequently.
                                         14.2 Phrasal inclusory constructions   65714.2.      Phrasal inclusory constructions14.2.1. The structureIn a phrasal inclusory construction there is an independent personal pronoun
that has the inclusory function and the included NP, and the two form a syntac-
tic phrase. Under certain conditions, discussed in the subsequent sections, the
two elements can occur in either order. (See also section 14.2.7 for discussion
of the function of the variable ordering where it is permitted.) In (14-1) further
above, it is the inclusory pronoun that comes first, while in broadly synony-
mous (14-3) it is the included NP that comes first:(14-3)     Doqora-ku        kamareqa meki                        lae
           sibling-1SG.PERS 1DU(EXCL) 1DU(EXCL).FUT              go           ma=i        qusungadi.
           VENT=LOC    tomorrow
           ‘My brother and I will come tomorrow.’    In focusing and topicalization it is the inclusory construction as a whole that
is fronted. The inclusory pronoun and the included NP together form a noun
phrase. Example (14-4) contains a focused inclusory construction:(14-4)     Qedata kera na kera                  ngali-a     mai iqa
           Qedata 3PL FOC 3PL.NFUT              carry-3.OBJ VENT fish           naqi.
           this
           ‘It was Qedata with/and the others that brought this fish.’    For an example of a topicalized phrasal inclusory construction see (14-24) in
section 14.2.4.
    Phrasal inclusory constructions are headed, and it is the inclusory pronoun
that is the head. First, when a phrasal inclusory construction occurs in the sub-
ject position of a verbal clause, it is the pronoun that determines the person,
number and exclusivity categories of the subject marker. The subject marker
agrees with the inclusory pronoun, regardless of the order of the inclusory pro-
noun and the included NP. Both in (14-1), where the inclusory pronoun comes
first, and in (14-3), where it comes second, the subject markers are first person
dual exclusive. See also examples (14-6) and (14-7) in section 14.2.2. For evi-
dence of the head status of the inclusory pronoun in verbless sentences see (14-
8) – (14-10), also in section 14.2.2.
658      Constructions with inclusory pronominals
    And second, the inclusory pronoun is the head of a phrasal inclusory con-
struction on semantic grounds, with the included NP a modifier. The pronoun
denotes the superset, of which the included NP denotes a subset.
    The included NP may be coordinate. In (14-5) there are two inclusory con-
structions. In B’s sentence the included NP is tei ‘who?’. And in the second of
A’s sentences, the included NP is coordinate: ‘Demesi and Dioni’.","[682, 683, 684, 685, 686, 687]"
"
33.3.     Purpose clauses and purpose nominalizations33.3.1. IntroductionSeveral types of purpose construction need to be distinguished in Toqabaqita.
First, there are finite purpose clauses and purpose nominalizations. Second,
there are different markers used with (finite) purpose clauses, partly depending
on whether the purpose is positive or negative. And third, there are special pur-
pose constructions used with the verb lae ‘go’ in the preceding clause.
   Purpose clauses are discussed first. Regardless of the type of purpose-clause
construction, the order of the clauses is always iconic: main clause - purpose
clause. The same types of purpose clauses are used regardless of whether the
subjects of the main and the purpose clauses are different or identical.
   There are three markers used with purpose clauses: uri, fasi, and ada. Uri is
used only with positive-purpose clauses; fasi is used both with positive-purpose
clauses and with negative-purpose clause, but much less commonly with the
1146      Reason and purpose clauses
latter; and ada, which is the timitive marker (section 18.6), is used only to ex-
press negative purpose.","[1198, 1199]"
"
20.4.3. Purpose imperatives with the verb lae ‘go’ in the first clauseAs discussed in section 33.3.3, clauses with the verb lae ‘go’ as the first clause
in a construction that expresses or implies purpose (‘go in order to X’) often
lack a subject marker. This is also the case in positive imperatives that express
purpose where the first imperative clause contains lae, regardless of the gram-
matical person and number of the subject. It is the second clause, if any, that
contains a subject marker.",[910]
"(19-117)   Nee, ma       i     fei    na  qaburu naqi qe

           be.located=LOC LOCPRO
           ‘Hey, where is this ogre [we have been talking about]?’    This is the least common of the three types of locational-sentence interroga-
tives. This may be owing to its relative complexity, because in addition to the
fronted interrogative prepositional phrase with fei another prepositional phrase,
with the locative pro-form ei, is required.
    In the third strategy, the locative verb and fei precede the subject: nii/ii fei
X, X being the subject, ‘where is X?’, literally ‘is located where X?’; see also
(19-37) in section 19.3.2. As discussed in that section, even though the locative
verb and fei precede the subject, they are not in the focus position. Locational
interrogative sentences with inverted, [verb.phrase subject] order are used com-
monly.",[873]

           (‘I met them, including those people, on the road.’)    In those cases where inclusory constructions can occur within phrases, there
is always a mismatch in the person features. The included NP is necessarily
third person, and the inclusory suffix may be first person exclusive or second
person, dual or plural. In those cases where a split inclusory construction is
ungrammatical, there would be no mismatch in the person features: both the
included NP and the inclusory suffix would be third person. There is then a
general condition on split inclusory constructions inside phrases such that the
included NP and the inclusory suffix must not share the person feature. This
restriction on the person feature does not apply to split inclusory constructions
in the subject position, where the included NP and the inclusory subject marker
do not occur in the same immediate phrase. This is another respect in which
inclusory constructions within phrases have different properties from those in
the subject position.37
14.3.2. Mismatch in featuresSplit inclusory constructions are characterized by a mismatch in the person,
number and exclusivity features between the included NP and the dependent
inclusory pronominal. In (14-47) there is a mismatch in number:(14-47)    Tha          Ulufaalu      keki    nguu qa=fa    Sandee
           PERSMKR      Ulufaalu      3PL.FUT sing GENP=CLF Sunday
                                           14.3 Split inclusory constructions   673           loo.
           upward
           ‘Ulufaalu ‘n them [i.e. Ulufaalu and the band he leads] will (play
           and) sing next Sunday.’   In (14-48) there is a mismatch in the number, person, and exclusivity fea-
tures:(14-48)    Lae   ma=i     buria-mareqa          ni
           go    VENT=LOC behind-1DU(EXCL).PERS PERSMKR           Saelifiqa.
           Saelifiqa
           ‘Follow me and Saelifiqa.’    In fact, it is the mismatch, disagreement in features that identifies a con-
struction as inclusory. That is, the disagreement is functional. The inclusory
pronominals do not “copy” the relevant features of the included NP. They
themselves are meaningful. They are the ones that identify the superset. Both
the inclusory pronominals and the included NP serve to denote the referents,
but they are not referentially equivalent.
    As discussed in section 4.9, there can be disagreement in the number feature
between the subject noun phrase and the subject marker, and in some cases that
kind of disagreement is functional too, allowing for different conceptualizations
of the referents, as individuated or not individuated.
    In that kind of feature disagreement, the disagreeing dependent pronominal
supplies certain information that is not supplied by the relevant noun phrase.
This is also the case in split inclusory constructions.38
Notes1.    Ray (1926: 479, fn 16) gives the year of publication as 1823, but that should be
      1923.
2.    I am grateful to Phil Quick (pers. comm., June 2006) for bringing Pike and
      Simons’ study to my attention.
3.    In Hoava (spoken in the western Solomon Islands), also an Oceanic language but
      only distantly related to Toqabaqita, the word for ‘monkey’ is maqe, where ortho-
      graphic q represents [0g] (Davis 2003).
4.    As Christine Foris put it very aptly some years ago when she, David Foris, and I
      had a conversation on the subject of the use of the apostrophe for the glottal stop
      in various languages: “The apostrophe is an insult to the consonants.”
5.    Strictly speaking, the label ‘exclusive’ is then not necessary; for example, 1PL
      could only signify traditional 1PL(EXCL). However, it has been retained here for
      the sake of transparency.
6.    The terms “syntactically-extended intransitive verbs” and “syntactically-extended
      transitive verbs” (section 4.2.3.1) are used here to distinguish such verbs from ex-
      tended (Class 1) long transitive verbs, which contain the stem-extender morpheme
      (section 4.2.3.2.2).
7.    Cf. note 6.
8.    Pawley (1973) has reconstructed *-aki(ni) as the long transitive suffix(es) in Proto
      Oceanic. The evidence for the variant *-akini came from languages that are close
      relatives of Toqabaqita. The Toqabaqita evidence suggests that the form of the suf-
      fix was *-aki and that the form -Cani, with accretion of thematic consonants, was a
      later development. Accretion of thematic consonants also took place in the Toqa-
      baqita variant -Caqi. Evans (2003), following Clark (1973), treats *-akini as bi-
      morphemic, *-akin-i, where the *-i is the short transitive suffix.
9.    Such morphologically extended long transitive verbs need to be distinguished from
      syntactically-extended intransitive verbs (section 4.2.2.1) and syntactically-
      extended transitive verbs (section 4.2.3.1).
10.   A few Class 2 transitive verbs and a few nouns undergo metathesis of the conso-
      nant and the vowel of the last syllable that results in those stems ending in a con-
      sonant. The metathesis is conditioned partly phonologically and partly morpho-
      logically; see sections 4.2.3.2.1 and 8.1.2 respectively. However, the basic forms
      of all such verbs and nouns end in a vowel.
11.   Some such tendencies have been identified for other Oceanic languages; see Arms
      (1974), Clark (1977), Geraghty (1983), and Lichtenberk (1978, 2001).
12.   This was discussed in a broader Oceanic perspective in Lichtenberk (1993).
13.   The Kwara’ae language, a close relative of Toqabaqita, has a verb sai ‘know’
      (Deck 1934), of which Toqabaqita thai is a cognate.
                                                                              Notes     67514.   An association of short transitive verbs of movement and posture with direct ob-
      jects that refer to goals and locations has been identified by Pawley (1973) for
      various Oceanic languages.
15.   Marching Rule, or rather Maasina Rule, was a political-social-cultural movement
      that existed from the mid 1940s to the early 1950s (Laracy 1983). Here the com-
      mon, even though inaccurate label “Marching Rule” is used, because it corre-
      sponds more closely to how the name is rendered in Toqabaqita in the examples
      given in this grammar: Maasin Ruul, rather than Maasina Ruul. The double a in
      Maasin and the double uu in Ruul represent long vowels. This is also the way the
      name of the movement is normally pronounced when Toqabaqita people are
      speaking in Solomon Islands Pijin.
16.   There is also a form soe-qe, found in the object-incorporating compound soe-qe
      kini ‘of a man: have illicit sex with a woman’; cf. soe (tr.) ‘ask about a potential
      bride; ask whether a girl is available for marriage (asking the girl’s parents, not the
      girl herself)’ (the direct object refers to the potential bride); kini ‘woman’, ‘wife’.
17.   The term “anterior-continuing” is taken from Bybee et al. (1994). There, however,
      “anterior” is synonymous with “perfect”. In this grammar, on the other hand, the
      terms “anterior” and “perfect” designate different functions.
18.   A distinction is usually made between a restitutive and a repetitive function; see,
      e.g., Pittner (2003) and Jäger and Blutner (2003). However, for Toqabaqita the la-
      bel “repetitive” is not satisfactory because, as will be demonstrated, laqu is often
      used when, strictly speaking, there is not an exact repetition of a states of affairs.
19.   In Lichtenberk (2002) a distinction was made between possessor-beneficiaries and
      recipients. Those two categories have been reanalyzed here as one category of re-
      cipient-benefactives.
20.   Crosslinguistically, links between partitives and diminutives are quite common;
      see Jurafsky (1996).
21.   Cognates of Toqabaqita maa in various Oceanic languages also tend to have large
      semantic ranges (Chowning 1996).
22.   Pawley (1972) has reconstructed *mata-qi as a kind of numeral classifier for Proto-
      Eastern Oceanic, based on *mata ‘eye’ (see also Hooper 1985). Toqabaqita maa is
      a regular reflex of *mata, and ma-qe is a regular reflex of *mata-qi, with some sec-
      ondary developments (the reduction of maa to ma and the change of *-qi to -qe af-
      ter a non-high vowel [section 8.2.1]).
23.   Noni ‘body’ is found in, e.g., Baelelea (Tryon and Hackman 1983), Lau (Fox
      1974) and Kwaio (Keesing 1975).
24.   As discussed by Ross (1998a, b), modification of nouns by verbs is not unusual in
      Oceanic.
25.   Both thaama and thaina continue Proto Oceanic etyma, *tama ‘father’ and *tina
      ‘mother’ (Lichtenberk 1988a), respectively. In fact, both etyma, with these mean-
      ings, go as far back as Proto Austronesian.
26.   The same etymon is also found, in a different phonological form again, in the noun
      for ‘son’, kaluwani, where wani is related to wane ‘man’.
676     Notes
27.   For a view of possessive constructions in Oceanic as being sensitive to the nature
      of the relation between the possessum and the possessor, and for some other views,
      see Lichtenberk (to appear).
28.   The Toqabaqita associative suffix is a reflex of Proto Oceanic *-qi (Hooper 1985)
      or *qi (Ross 1998b), the -qe variant being a later development. For some reason,
      the vowel of the suffix has failed to assimilate in weleqi.
29.   Crosslinguistically, it is common for action nominals to exhibit both nominal and
      verbal properties (Comrie and Thompson 1985).
30.   The term “confective” is adopted from Arms (1974), although his interpretation of
      the confective category is broader than that adopted here.
31.   The name of the town is usually pronounced [!ánk'], but the speaker who said
      sentence (10-199) pronounced it [!""7k+], which corresponds to the Solomon Is-
      lands Pijin pronunciation.
32.   For the term “coordinand” see Haspelmath (2004).
33.   What is called anaphoric distance in Lichtenberk (1988b) corresponds to Givón’s
      (1983) notion of referential distance.
34.   The third possibility, the antecedent in the narrative portion of a text and the ana-
      phoric mention in a subsequent direct speech, does not seem to occur. That is,
      while a narrator has referential access both to the narrative portion of the text and
      to direct speech by characters in that text, a character in a text does not have refer-
      ential access to the narrative portion of that text.
35.   The term “presentative demonstrative adverbs” has been modelled on Anderson
      and Keenan’s (1985) category of presentative demonstratives.
36.   I am grateful to Bernard Comrie for pointing this out to me.
37.   A different explanation for the avoidance of split inclusory constructions where the
      inclusory suffix would be third person was proposed in Lichtenberk (2000a). It
      was suggested there that such constructions would look like ungrammatical coun-
      terparts of non-inclusory constructions. That analysis is superseded by the one pre-
      sented here.
38.   See Barlow (1992) for a view of agreement as ultimately a discourse notion.

40.3.     Code-mixingCode-mixing between Toqabaqita and Pijin is quite common, and it is not un-
usual for adults to use Pijin words without phonological accommodation even
to little children, and for such children to use them themselves. Not surpris-
ingly, code mixing is often resorted to when there is no Toqabaqita equivalent,
native or borrowed. For example:(40-18)     ... kera         suqu-si-a              qana      plastik, ....
                 3PL.NFUT protect-TR-3SG.OBJ INS              plastic
            ‘... they protected it [a place] with plastic (as a cover) ....’(40-19)     Mika                lafu-a        miksa        qeri, teqe miksa,
            1PL(EXCL).SEQ       pick.up-3.OBJ mixer        that one mixer            teqe qamplifae, teq=qenjin, roo maekrofon.
            one amplifier one=engine two microphone
            ‘We picked up [in a shop; that is, ‘we bought’] the (sound) mixer,
            one mixer, one amplifier, one generator (lit.: engine), two micro-
            phones.’   Examples of code-mixing are found in many places in this grammar.
   However, non-accommodated Pijin words are used even when there is a
native equivalent or an accommodated borrowing. There are certain non-
accommodated words that are particularly common. For example:
1300      Toqabaqita, Pijin, and English
(40-20)      kastom ‘custom’, even when referring to traditional customs; be-
                   sides biibirangaa ‘custom, customary way of doing things’,
                   biranga ‘usual behaviour; usual, customary way of doing st.,
                   of behaving’, and birangaa ‘behaviour; way of doing st.;
                   usual, customary way of doing things’
             langwis [lap0gw+s] (or [lap0gw+s]?) ‘language’; besides the deverbal
                   noun ngata-a ‘talk, speech’, ‘language’, and the nominaliza-
                   tion ngata-laa ‘speaking; talk, speech’, ‘language’, based on
                   the verb ngata ‘talk, speak’
             kisin ‘cookhouse, kitchen’, besides luma ni naqare(-laa) (luma
                   ‘family house’, ni ligature, naqare ‘cook’, -laa nominalizer),
                   which is not normally used; and accommodated kisina (less
                   common than kisin)
             gavman ‘government’; there is an accommodated form gafumanu,
                   but it is is not used much    In code-mixing, the Pijin words are usually treated syntactically in the same
way that native words of the corresponding grammatical categories and sub-
categories are. In (40-21) below, kastom ‘custom’ occurs in the possessum posi-
tion in a bare possessive construction, and in (40-22) kisin ‘kitchen’ functions
as the head of the complement in a stacked prepositional phrase:(40-21)      Qe       abu.                 Kastom kulu        qana
             3SG.NFUT be.forbidden         custom PL(INCL)    GENP             toqa     na=i        Toqabaqita.
             people REL=LOC Toqabaqita
             ‘That [a kind of behaviour just discussed] was forbidden. (Such
             was) our custom, (a custom) of the people of Toqabaqita.’(40-22)      Qi    laa    kisin   qe=aqi.
             LOC   IN     kitchen 3SG.NFUT=not.be.so
             ‘Not in the kitchen.’ Here: ‘It is not in the kitchen.’ (Speaking to a
             person who was going to look for something, thinking it might be in
             the kitchen.)   In the next example, there are two instances of code-mixing, gavman ‘gov-
ernment’ and lokap ‘jail, prison’. Both have accommodated variants, gafumanu
and lokafu, respectively, but these are less common than their non-
accommodated counterparts.
                                                          40.3 Code mixing    1301(40-23)    Gavman          ka           ngali-da,    ka      alu-da

           LOC    IN jail
           ‘The Government took them, put them in jail, ....’   Only a relatively small number of verbs have been borrowed from Pijin. On
the other hand, Pijin verbs commonly occur in code-mixing. In (40-24) the Pijin
verb interes ‘be interested’ is negated in the same way that Toqabaqita verbs
are:(40-24)    Nia qe             aqi        si           interes.
           3SG 3SG.NFUT NEGV 3SG.NEG be.interested
           ‘He is not interested (in listening to the radio).’   And in (40-25) the verb qapiil ‘appeal’ is followed by two postverbal parti-
cles:(4-25)     Qe         qapiil sui         naqa?
           3SG.NFUT appeal COMPL PRF
           ‘Has he appealed (the court decision)?’ ‘Has he lodged an appeal?’   A commonly heard expression is:(40-26)    Tenkyu     qasia naqa.
           thank.you INTS     INTS
           ‘Thank you very much.’   Tenkyu is phonetically [t'p0kj7]. The English phrase ‘thank you’ has been re-
interpreted as a unitary lexical item in Pijin. In the Pijin spoken in the Toqa-
baqita area the form is tenkyu. (Jourdan [2002] gives the following Pijin forms
for ‘thank you’: tangio, also tankio, tankiu, tangiu.) In Toqabaqita, tenkyu has
the verbal property of taking the postverbal intensifiers qasia and naqa. On the
other hand, it is possible that the two particles are used here idiosyncratically as
the equivalent of Pijin tumas ‘very much’ in tenkyu tumas ‘thank you very
much’. The use of tenkyu appears to be restricted to the expression Tenkyu
qasia naqa. ‘Thank you very much.’.
   The next example contains a non-accommodated verb nominalized in the
same way that Toqabaqaita verbs are, with the suffix -laa. The nominalization
felouship-laa is used with the meaning ‘holding a fellowship meeting in
church’. The speaker pronounced the word with the /5/ sound (represented
1302      Toqabaqita, Pijin, and English
orthographically as sh), which is not characteristic of Pijin, and so this is likely
to be an instance of English code-mixing.","[1352, 1353, 1354, 1355]"

4.2.2.2. Intransitive verbs formed by reduplicationA relatively small number of intransitive verbs are formed by reduplication of
the base that occurs in the corresponding transitive verb. If the transitive verb
has a transitive suffix, the suffix is absent from the intransitive form; see (c)-(f)
in (4-25). In a few cases, there is a change in the last vowel of the base; see (d).(4-25)           intransitive                    transitive         a.      koo-kori                        kori
                 ‘grate coconut’                 ‘grate, scrape’         b.      qee-qeta                        qeta
                 ‘be different’,                 ‘keep st. (e.g. food)
                 ‘be separate’                   for os., not sharing it’         c.      sii-siu                         siu-fi
                 ‘bathe (os.)’                   ‘bathe (sb.)’
62   The verb phrase
           d.      dee-dema                       deme-si

                   ‘eat food whole,               ‘eat (impolite)’

                   ‘beckon’                       ‘beckon sb.’   In examples given elsewhere in the grammar, this kind of derivational redu-
plication is not indicated in order not to confuse it with reduplication that has a
tense-marking or an aspectual-marking function.","[90, 91]"
"   And in (2-90) the feminine person marker /n+/ has fused with the preceding
possessum noun and the personal suffix indexing the possessor has been elided:(2-90)     /6a+na-na        n+               a0ar+!+/
           mother-3.PERS PERSMKR             Fangariqi
           ‘Fangariqi’s mother’           with fusion: /6a+na=n+            a0ar+!+/
                       mother:3.PERS=PERSMKR Fangariqi    The verbs /snr'-!'/ and /snr'-!a/ ‘think that, assume that’, with the detransi-
tivizing suffix /-!'/ ~ /-!a/, sometimes fuse with the following irrealis marker
/sa/ ~ /sn/ as /sn=sa/ or /sn=sn/: ‘think’:DETR=IRR. See, for example, (29-138)
and (29-139), respectively, in section 29.4.8.
    As mentioned above, the third person singular subject marker typically cliti-
cizes onto the following negative verb /a!+/ and it is the subject marker that
carries word-initial stress. There is no loss of phonological material here paral-
lel to what happens in fusion. However, because of the shift in stress, unlike
elsewhere when the subject marker cliticizes onto the following verb, this type
of phonological unity is marked in the rest of the grammar as involving fusion.

2.6.     Orthographic conventionsIn the rest of the grammar, the data are presented in orthography, unless there is
a reason to present them in phonemic or phonetic transcription. The correspon-
dences between the Toqabaqita phonemes and the orthographic symbols are
given in Table 2.3.

              w                  w    The set of orthographic symbols employed in this grammar departs from the
traditional orthography in the representation of the glottal stop and (partly) in
the representation of /0/. Present-day Toqabaqita writing conventions follow
those established by South Sea Evangelical Mission missionaries in their trans-
lation of the New Testament (Na alaofua falu: …. [1923 (1977)]. There the
symbol n is used to represent /0/, and the apostrophe to represent the glottal
stop. These days the diagraph ng is quite commonly used instead of n, espe-
cially by the younger people, and I have adopted ng here for typographical con-
venience.
    The glottal stop is rarely represented in the translation of the New Testament
and in the conventional orthography. I have decided to use the letter q to repre-
sent the glottal stop. The apostrophe is not a letter and does not distinguish
between the lower and the upper cases.4 By writing the glottal stop consistently,
I have already departed from the conventional orthography. (I have retained the
                                                   2.6 Orthographic conventions   41apostrophe in those proper names that are, at least sometimes, written in that
way, for example, Foana’ota [a personal name] and Malu’u [a place name].
However, the letter q is used here consistently in the name of the language, the
people and the area, Toqabaqita.) And there are other respects in which the way
the language is written here departs from conventional writing. In conventional
writing, double vowels are written as single, while sequences of two identical
vowel letters are used when in fact there is a glottal stop in between. And in
some cases what is analyzed in this grammar as a single although polymor-
phemic word is written as a sequence of words in conventional writing.
   Speakers of Toqabaqita that I have spoken to about the issue of the glottal
stop readily agree that there is a phonological difference between words that are
distinguished only by the presence and absence of a glottal stop; for example
/!ab7/ ‘blood’ and /ab7/ ‘be taboo, not allowed, forbidden’, ‘be sacred, holy (in
the Christian sense)’, although the two words are written in the same way. They
also agree that it would be useful for the difference to be reflected in writing.
They are aware of grammatical errors in the translation of the New Testament;
and even though copies of the translation are available, it is not much used in
church (one of the English versions being normally used).
   Some additional orthographic symbols are used here to represent sounds that
are not part of the Toqabaqita inventory of phonemes and that occur in code
mixing (section 40.3). These are listed in table 2.4.","[68, 69, 70]"

23.3.    Self-directed, reflexive situationsIn a self-directed, reflexive situation one and the same participant is both actor
and non-actor (often undergoer). Such situations can also be viewed as not at-
tributable to an outside agency or cause, because the actor is the same entity as
the non-actor. To emphasize the self-directed nature of a situation, the construc-
tion with the noun tala is used, not the preverbal particle tala. While a self-
containedness construction may be used to emphasize the self-directed, reflex-
ive nature of a situation, it is not necessary. Before the use of the self-
containedness construction is discussed, it is necessary to consider encoding of
self-directed situations in general.
    In Toqabaqita the same sets of pronouns, object-indexing suffixes and per-
sonal suffixes are used regardless of whether or not there is coreferentiality
between the pronoun or the suffix and another element in the clause. There is a
general condition on clauses encoding self-directed, reflexive situations such
that in a clause the antecedent must precede the anaphoric element. The sen-
tence in (23-8), where the lexical noun phrase precedes the pronoun, can, but
does not have to, encode a reflexive situation:(23-8)      Wanei e            ngata suli niai, j ….
            man     3SG.NFUT speak PROL 3SG
            a. ‘The man spoke about himself ….’
            b. ‘The man spoke about him/her ….’
892      Self-contained situations
   On the other hand, the sentence in (23-9), where the order of the lexical and
the pronominal noun phrases is reversed, cannot encode a reflexive situation:(23-9)       Niai e           ngata suli-a             wanej ….
             3SG 3SG.NFUT speak PROL-3.OBJ             man
             ‘He/she spoke about the man ….’  In the next example a reflexive interpretation is strongly preferred over a
non-reflexive one, for pragmatic reasons:(23-10)      Loi     qeri e              fiku nia.
             snake that 3SG.NFUT coil.up 3SG
             ‘The snake coiled itself up.’    On the other hand, (23-11), with the pronoun in the subject position and the
lexical noun phrase in the direct-object position, cannot express a reflexive
situation:(23-11)      Nia e             fiku-a      loi         qeri.
             3SG 3SG.NFUT coil.up-3.OBJ snake          that
             ‘He/she coiled up the snake.’    In clauses expressing self-directed situations, there is coreferentiality be-
tween the subject (expressed or not) and the direct object or an oblique object.
The antecedent may be a subject noun phrase and the corresponding subject
marker, a subject marker alone, or there may be no overt expression of the an-
tecedent, as is often the case in second-person singular imperatives. The ana-
phoric element can be an independent personal pronoun, an object suffix or a
personal suffix. The anaphoric uses of the pronouns, the object suffixes and the
personal suffixes are governed by the same basic rules as when those elements
are used non-anaphorically. (See section 4.2.3.2.1 for Class 1 transitive verbs,
section 4.2.3.3.1 for Class 2 transitive verbs, section 8.1.2 for the possessum
nouns in the suffixing possessive noun phrase, section 10.3.1 for the verb-like
prepositions, and section 10.4.1 for the noun-like prepositions.) With Class 1
transitive verbs and with the verb-like prepositions, both the independent per-
sonal pronouns in an object position and the object-indexing suffixes are gram-
matically sanctioned in the third person. However, in expressions of reflexive
situations it is normally the pronoun rather than the suffix that is used, although
the animacy status of a participant plays a role too, as discussed further below.
Examples (23-12) – (23-21) illustrate the various possibilities.
    In (23-12) the relevant participant is the speaker, the verb is Class 1 transi-
tive, and there only the pronoun option is grammatically available:

           (That is, I entrust myself to your protection.)   In (23-13) the relevant participant is the addressee, encoded as an oblique
object with the general verb-like preposition qani. Here too only the pronoun
option is available. The sentence is an imperative, and there is no overt expres-
sion of the subject.","[944, 945, 946]"

           sustenance-PL(INCL).PERS FOC food
           ‘Our sustenance, that’s what food is.’   And while (39-51) further above can be seen as expressing contrast, the set
of potential candidates is not clearly defined: the addressee as against every
human being?
   Contrastiveness is not a binary notion, rather a gradient one (see, for exam-
ple, Lambrecht [1994], following Bolinger [1961]). It ranges from clear, ex-
plicit contrast where the alternatives are identified, as for example in (39-49)
above (the speaker and the addressee), to implicit contrast where only the can-
didate to which the proposition applies is identified, the other or others being
suggested more or less strongly, as in (39-50) (the other members of the old
man’s family), in (39-51) (all other humans?), and in (39-52) (all other con-
ceivable functions that food might have?).
   The focus construction is used with two other functions. In one it is a clause
that is in focus. The clause in focus expresses the reason for, or the cause of,
the situation expressed in the presupposition domain. The reason/cause is high-
lighted, emphasized:(39-53)    Qo       ade qufita            na    qaba-mu      ka
           2SG.NFUT do do.what?           FOC   arm-2SG.PERS 3SG.SEQ           qoo?

           arm?’ ‘How did your arm get broken’?
1290    Focusing
   Focused reason clauses are discussed in section 33.2.2
   And second, the consequence marker adelana can be put in focus to empha-
size the fact that the situation expressed in the presupposition clause is indeed
the consequence of the situation expressed in another, usually the immediately
preceding, clause; see (39-27) in section 39.2, and chapter 34.

Toqabaqita, Solomon Islands Pijin, and English
40.1.   IntroductionAs a norm, Toqabaqita people are bilingual in their own language and in Solo-
mon Islands Pijin, an English-lexifier creole, which is the lingua franca in the
Solomon Islands. School education is in English, and so some people, espe-
cially those of the younger generations, with several years of formal education,
have some knowledge of English. Furthermore, people also tend to have at least
some passive knowledge of the neighbouring languages and dialects.
    Borrowing from Pijin into Toqabaqita has been quite extensive, but with the
exceptions of numerals, it has been restricted to lexical items that belong in the
major, open classes of nouns and verbs, the former in particular. There is no
evidence of borrowing of grammatical items or of structural borrowing. By
borrowing is here meant the adoption of a Pijin lexical item into the lexicon of
Toqabaqita, which often necessitates phonological accommodation. This is to
be distinguished from code-mixing, where Pijin words are used in Toqabaqita
discourse in a basically ad hoc manner, often without being accommodated to
Toqabaqita phonological patterns. However, the distinction between estab-
lished borrowings and code-mixing is not a hard and fast one. Some Pijin words
happen to fit the phonological patterns of Toqabaqita and so no accommodation
is necessary. Second, some Pijin words that do not fit the phonological patterns
of Toqabaqita are used commonly in Toqabaqita discourse without accommo-
dation. And third, one and the same Pijin etymon may sometimes be used in an
accommodated form and sometimes in a non-accommodated form, even by the
same speaker. The boundaries of the Toqabaqita lexicon are not clear-cut. For
discussion of this with respect to what should or should not be included in a
dictionary of Toqabaqita see Lichtenberk (2003b).
    The discussion that follows is concerned only with borrowing and code-
mixing that involves Solomon Islands Pijin or, occasionally, English. It is not
concerned with borrowing and code-mixing that involves the neighbouring or
nearby lects. Because of the close similarities between Toqabaqita and the other
lects, borrowings and instances of code-switching are difficult to identify in the
absence of a detailed study. Not infrequently, speakers of Toqabaqita disagree
among themselves whether a given word is a borrowing from a neighbouring or
a nearby lect or not.
1292     Toqabaqita, Pijin, and English
    It needs to be kept in mind that the main donor/source language, Solomon
Islands Pijin, itself is not monolithic. There is a large amount of variation with
respect to how anglicized a person’s Pijin is. On the whole, urban Pijin has
more English features than rural Pijin. Second, people with extensive formal
education in English tend to speak Pijin with more English features than speak-
ers with little or no such education. And the extent of English features in a per-
son’s Pijin may also depend on the speech situation itself: one and the same
person may use more anglicized Pijin in formal contexts than in informal con-
texts. (See Jourdan [2002] for a brief mention of the difficulties with drawing a
line between Pijin and English.) The kind of Pijin a person speaks may also be
affected by his or her native language.","[1342, 1343, 1344, 1345]"

struction with a purpose subordinator is not used (section 33.3.3). On the other
hand, with a purpose nominalization, the purpose preposition is required. In
(33-80) the nominalization is of the double type (section 9.1.2).",[1216]

words, the spelling conventions of Jourdan (2002) are used, except that the
glottal stop (not present in Pijin) is written, as q, and /j/ is written as y. The
form in which a phonologically unaccommodated Pijin word occurs in code
mixing in Toqabaqita is not necessarily the same as that in which it is given in
Jourdan (2002).

"   For an example of fasi with the object suffix see (33-2) in section 33.1.
   In (33-30) there are two instances of the purpose marker uri. The first one
has a noun phrase as its complement, and the second one a clause:(33-30)      Qe       alu-a             uri-a           kule-qe

          this island by crushing it/breaking it up.’   Uri, but not fasi, can occur in combination with the complementizer na, in
which case it always takes the object suffix -a. In (33-32) the combination of
uri and na has two coordinated clauses in its scope:(33-32)   Babatana, si    manga na ka       sui                   ki

          ‘Love magic, in the days gone by, people used it in order to (be able
          to) get married, both men and women.’ (Foli kini signifies a man
          marrying a woman [paying a bride price] and toqo-wane signifies a
          woman marrying a man.)   For another example of uri-a with the complementizer see (33-8) in section
33.1.
1148      Reason and purpose clauses
   It is possible for the two purpose markers to be combined as uri-a fasi:(33-33)      Iu,   kera keka   fita            uri-a       fasi seqe-da
             yes   3PL 3PL.SEQ run             PURP-3.OBJ PURP body-3PL.PERS             ka,                ka         sukani                oli      mai.
             3SG.SEQ[HESIT] 3SG.SEQ be.of.little.degree          return VENT
             ‘Yes, (and) they run [here: jog] so that their bodies may become a
             little slimmer again (lit.: so that their bodies come back a little).’    Such combined use of the two purpose markers is rare. Unexpectedly, it is
the first one, uri, that carries the object suffix. If uri-a fasi continued an earlier
[verb verb] compound, one would expect the object suffix to appear on the
second element rather than on the first one: *uri fasi-a. (See section 10.5 for
[verb verb] compounds, and section 33.2.1 for the complex reason marker sula
qani-a.) The fact that the object marker occurs on the first component suggests
that the complex purpose marker does not continue an earlier [verb verb] com-
pound and that it developed only after uri and fasi ceased to function as verbs.
    Purpose clauses can function as relative clauses modifying nouns. The pur-
pose clause expresses the purpose that the referent of the overall noun phrase
serves/would serve. Here it is normally the purpose marker fasi that is used, not
uri, although the combined form uri-a fasi is possible (see 33-38). Fasi does
not take the object suffix. In (33-34) there are two purpose constructions. The
first one employs a nominalized verb (section 33.3.5). The nominalization is a
complement of the purpose marker uri-a. The second one employs a finite pur-
pose clause. This second purpose construction restates, in a different way, what
is expressed in the first purpose construction, but here it is the marker fasi that
is used. In the finite purpose clause, instrument inversion has taken place (sec-
tion 10.7).","[1199, 1200, 1201]"

            ‘This story is (lit.: goes) about a man and his wife and a child of
            theirs, a boy.’    When the possessive structure occurs inside a larger sentence, and only
then, the order of the possessive marker and the possessum noun phrase can be
reversed, with the possessive marker following the possessum noun phrase.
However, this is possible only if the overall possessive noun phrase expresses a
subset. The sentences in (26-50a) and (26-50b) below illustrate the alternative
orderings of the possessive marker and the possessum noun phrase. The subject
markers are singular, even though the subject phrases refer to two people. That
is, the two children are treated grammatically as forming a (sub)set rather than
being individuated (section 4.9). This could be the case, for example, if the
children died at (more or less) the same time.(26-50)     a.    Qa-da           roo wela e               mae.

                  two child POSS-3PL.PERS 3SG.NFUT die
                  ‘Two of their children died.’ (They had other children.)   Similarly, instead of (26-47) further above, where the order inside the pos-
sessive noun phrase is [qa-PERS NP], the order could be [NP qa-PERS]:(26-51)     Teqe qaba qa-na              qe           qoo.

26.2.1.2.   Grammatically negative existential possessive sentencesThere are several ways in which negative counterparts of grammatically posi-
tive existential possessive sentences can be formed. The basic one is a negative
existential sentence of the type discussed in section 26.1.2.2, with the negative
existential verb aqi ‘not exist’, ‘not be available’ and its third person singular
subject marker, occurring before the subject. The subject consists of a posses-
sive noun phrase of the type discussed in the preceding section. In (26-52) the
possessive noun phrase is in bold.

           might eat it.’)   Just as in positive existential possessive sentences, the possessor may be
encoded not only by means of a personal suffix on the possessive marker, but
also be means of a topic noun phrase, as in (26-53) and (26-54):(26-53)    Wela qe             aqi          qa-n=ta                maka.

stepping in for them, by doing on their behalf what needs to be done’.)
   And just as in grammatically positive existential possessive sentences, the
possessive marker may be omitted if there is a topic noun phrase that encodes
the possessor:

           available.’)   And finally, again as in positive existential possessive sentences, there need
not be any expression of a possessor at all, the possessive relation being only
implied. Such sentences have the structure of ordinary negative existential sen-
tences (section 26.1.2.2).","[981, 982, 983, 984]"
"
33.3.2. Positive-purpose clausesPositive-purpose clauses ([do something] in order that a certain state of affairs
may obtain) can be introduced by uri or by fasi, or, rarely, by the two simulta-
neously, with uri preceding fasi. Fasi is more common than uri as a purpose
marker (Lichtenberk 1991b). Both uri and fasi can occur with or without the
third person object suffix -a, which indexes the purpose clause. With uri, the
object suffix is much more likely to be present than absent, while with fasi it is
much more likely to be absent than present. The subject marker in a verbal
positive-purpose clause can be either sequential or future, without any appre-
ciable difference in meaning. However, fasi favours sequential marking, while
uri favours future marking.
   The first two examples below contain fasi and the subsequent two uri. In
each pair, the subjects of the main and the subordinate clause are different in
the first example, and identical in the second example.",[1199]

             Bita 3SG.NFUT go          3SG.FUT    bathe    SBEN-3SG.PERS
             ‘Bita went to bathe.’   The future-tense subject marker in the second, purpose clause signals time
subsequent to the time of going, not necessarily to the time of speech. For ex-
ample, with respect to (33-51) Bita may have bathed already by the time of the
speech act.
   When the purpose is not realized, the irrealis marker sa is used in the pur-
pose clause. In (33-52) the lack of realization of the purpose is signalled, in
addition, by means of the final negative existential clause:

           ‘I went (lit.: had gone) to the market place to buy (lit.: take) fish, but
           (lit.: and) there weren’t any.’    The type of construction exemplified above overtly signals only a sequence
of events, but there is a strong implication of a purpose relation. In the situation
expressed in (33-50) above the speaker will go in order to see the man, in the
situation expressed in (33-51) Bita went in order to bathe, and in that expressed
in (33-52) the speaker went to the market in order to buy fish. In all those cases
the subject marker in the second, purpose clause is future-tense. However, it is
possible for a sequential subject marker to be used, rather than a future-tense
one. It is true that in the situation expressed in (33-53) below, the event of
bringing back the shrimp is explicitly encoded only as being subsequent to the
event of going. However, the event of going is not merely incidental to the
event of bringing back the shrimp: the two people went (to the streams) in or-
der to catch shrimp and bring them back to the house.","[1207, 1208]"

5.1.    The preverbal particles5.1.1. IntroductionThe preverbal particles occur between a subject marker and the verb; see (4-1)
in the preceding chapter. Only one preverbal particle ever occurs in a clause.
The particles are listed in table 5.1 in the order in which they will be discussed:Table 5.1. Preverbal particles           biqi, mala, maka, makeqe         immediate past, immediate future
           makafa                           ‘briefly’

           ota                              avertive
           tona, toneqe, tootona,           restrictive
           tootoneqe, tofa, tofe,
           tofeqe, tootofa, tootofeqe
           thafali-qi, thafali              inceptive
           thathami-qi, thathami            desiderative
           lalakwa                          undesiderative    The inceptive, desiderative, and undesiderative elements are different from
the other preverbal particles in one respect: unlike the other particles, they have
synonymous verbal counterparts. They are included among the preverbal parti-
cles, but discussion of these three elements is postponed until section 29.5,
where their status as particles is considered in detail.
    The inceptive and the desiderative markers optionally contain the detransi-
tivizing suffix (section 4.6) in its form -qi. One of the immediate-

restrictive markers end in -qe, which historically comes from the -qe variant of
the detransitivizing suffix. It is possible that the ineffectuality marker ma-
rungeqe and the immediate-past/immediate-future marker biqi were also origi-
nally formed by means of the detransitivizing suffix, but there is no evidence of
related suffixless forms. The inceptive markers thafali-qi and thafali, and the
desiderative markers thathami-qi and thathami have related verbal counterparts
in the present-day language, and the suffix is identified in glosses: thafali-qi,
thathami-qi. None of the other forms that contain reflexes of the detransitiviz-
ing suffix have related verbal (or other) counterparts, and they are treated here
as unanalyzed wholes. Some of the restrictive particles are reduplications,
which would be consistent with verbal origins.","[193, 194]"
"
5.1.8.   Tona, tofa, etc. restrictiveThere are a number of particles that signal that a situation is restricted only to
the event or state expressed in the clause, when some additional or different
states of affairs, performed by the same participant, are normally expected or
required. The particles are tona, toneqe, tootona, tootoneqe, tofa, tofe, tofeqe,
tootofa, tootofeqe. The reduplicated forms are used only in negative impera-
tives (although the other forms are possible there as well). Elsewhere, only tona
and tofa are used commonly, tona being more common than tofa. As mentioned
in section 20.3.1, in negative imperatives the verb is often reduplicated to ex-
press the meaning ‘stop doing such and such’. The use of the reduplicated re-
stricted-situation markers in negative imperatives suggests that all of these par-
ticles developed from erstwhile verbs. In addition to one of these preverbal
particles, the postverbal limiter ba- is often present as well.
    Tona and its variant toneqe also occur in noun phrases.
    The situations that are expected or required in addition to the one encoded in
a clause with a restricted-situation marker are usually not expressed, only im-

plied. In (5-24) what the speaker implies is that he travelled on the ship without
paying:(5-24)       Nau ku               {tofa        / tona}       lae     ba-kuqa

             LOC     IN   ship
             ‘I went on the ship for free, without paying.’ (Lit. ‘I just went on the
             ship.’)  In (5-25) the implication is that the man came empty-handed, although one
would have expected him to bring something:(5-25)       Wane    qe         tona      lae            bo=ma-na.
             man     3SG.NFUT RESTR go                   ASRT=VENT-3SG.PERS
             ‘Tne man came empty-handed.’   In (5-26) the implied message is that the addressee should do some work,
instead of just sitting idly around:(5-26)       Qo            {tofa / tofeqe        /   tona}         qono

             LIM-2SG.PERS      NPAST.HERE
             ‘You just sit here (doing nothing)!’    These particles can also signal that something is done for no obvious reason:
it is “just” done, without there being another situation that would serve as a
cause, purpose, rationale:(5-27)       Wane    e            tona      ila-ma-taqi  nau.

           (without being asked, without expecting anything in return).’   Example (5-29) shows the reduplicated variants in a negative imperative:(5-29)      Qosi    {tootona / tootoneqe         /     tootofa   /   tootofeqe}
            2SG.NEG RESTR / RESTR                /     RESTR     /   RESTR           takwe    ba-muqa!

           ‘Don’t just stand (there/here) (do something)!’
5.2.     The postverbal particles5.2.1.   IntroductionThe postverbal particles occur before lexical direct objects, but after direct
objects that are realized by independent personal pronouns; see (4-1) in section
4.1. The postverbal particles are listed in table 5.2 in the order in which they
occur in a verb complex, which is also the order in which they are discussed.
Those that occupy the same position in the verb complex and so are mutually
exclusive are grouped together in the table under the same letter. More than one
postverbal particle can occur simultaneously in a verb phrase.
    Some of the particles have shorter, combining forms used when those parti-
cles fuse with a following particle. This kind of fusion between certain particles
is obligatory. Some of the combining forms are also used when a particle car-
ries a personal suffix. Only the full forms of the particles are listed in table 5.2.
The combining forms are presented in the respective sections.
    Most of the particles also occur in noun phrases, although not necessarily
with the same meaning. Those particles that also occur in noun phrases are
marked with an asterisk in the table.
    The first two pairs of examples show the positioning of the postverbal parti-
cles before lexical direct objects and after pronominal direct objects, respec-
tively. In the first pair the particle is the precedentive one, fasi:(5-30)     Kwai        qolo-si-a               fasi suli-ku.

grammatical and lexicographical work on the language. The two kinds of study
of the language have been mutually beneficial. Detailed grammatical analysis
enabled a more accurate treatment of the grammatical elements in the diction-
ary than would have been the case otherwise. And the lexicographical work has
been of great importance to the grammatical analysis. In any language, gram-
matical rules, patterns, regularities are of highly different degrees of generality.
Few, if any, hold across the board. Many grammatical patterns are lexically
sensitive; they hold for some but not all members of a certain word class.","[34, 35]"

synonymous, because the compound has an idiosyncratic meaning.(12-8)      mee-qulau                   (12-9)     mea-na          qulau

the focus position, before the subject position. With the exception of one verb
in one type of locational interrogative construction, verbs cannot be fronted,
and, with one minor exception, neither can those types of prepositions that in-
dex their complements by personal or object suffixes. When the object of those
prepositions is fronted, the preposition is stranded behind. Example (3-32)

an inalienable type where the possessum is a part or a characteristic of the pos-
sessor:(3-34)     Wane gwalusu-n=e                      baba.

nouns are used primarily with human referents and occasionally with other
higher-animate referents. However, they are often used even with inanimate
referents as resumptive pronouns in the subject position to refer back to topic
phrases, and in the focus position. With dual and plural inanimate and non-
higher-animate subjects, it is normally the singular subject markers that are
used, unless the referents are to be individuated. And it is the singular object
suffixes that are normally used (in the absence of object phrases) to index in-
animate and non-higher-animate dual and plural objects.
   The distinction between intransitive and transitive verbs is well-marked
morphologically. There are two basic classes of transitive verbs. With one,
third-person direct objects are indexed on the verb; with the other, all direct
objects are indexed. Many members of the first class carry one of two types of
transitive suffixes.
    Apart from cases of conversion, verbs can be nominalized in one of two
ways. One type of derivation forms (“action”) nominalizations, which exhibit
properties both of nouns and of verbs. The other type forms deverbal nouns,
which are fully-fledged nouns.
52     Grammatical profile
   There are finite complement clauses, relative clauses, and adverbial subor-
dinate clauses. Relative clauses are, more often than not, introduced by the
marker na, which can also introduce complement clause, although that is not
common. The same element also normally introduces the presupposition do-
main in the focus construction. And it is also used with one type of preposi-
tional phrase.
   The language has both prefixes and suffixes. All inflectional affixes are
suffixes. Some derivational affixes are suffixes, while others are prefixes.","[78, 79, 80, 81]"

16   Phonology
   If, through a morphological process, three identical vowels were to occur
next to each other, one of them is deleted:(2-27)     a.    /a!a-!akdpaa-a/            [ay!:apkdpa:a]
                 CAUS-be.cured-3SG.OBJ

                 CAUS-work-3SG.OBJ
                 ‘instruct him/her how to work’    Lexical morphemes consist of at least two syllables. Some grammatical
words are monosyllabic. In normal speech the monosyllabic words cliticize
onto the preceding or the following word (section 2.5). When they do not cliti-
cize, in very slow speech, such as in hesitation, their vowel is lengthened and
they receive some stress. In (2-28) the masculine person marker /6a/, instead of
cliticizing onto the preceding word, is a separate phonetic word and its vowel is
lengthened:(2-28)     [w'pla 6ay:         dnpn:]
           child    PERSMKR thing
           ‘the child of what’s his name’ (lit.: ‘the child of the [masculine]
           thing’)   There are many disyllabic lexical and some grammatical morphemes that
contain geminate vowels. For example:(2-29)     a.    /raa/ (intr. v.; n.) ‘work’
           b.    /077/ (intr. v.; n.) ‘sing’, ‘song’
           c.    /t''/ ‘of a canoe: run aground in shallow water’
           d.    /nn/ ‘be sour’
           e.    /n++/ ‘be located (at a place)’
           f.    /baa/ ‘that’ (determiner demonstrative)
           g.    /!77/ anterior-continuing postverbal particle    There are several pieces of evidence that such words are indeed disyllabic,
rather than monosyllabic with a lengthened vowel (to make them bimoraic).
First, even though in fast speech the two vowels are sometimes realized as one
long one, normally there is rearticulation of the vowels. There are a few words
that consist exclusively of two identical vowels. In such cases the first, word-
initial vowel is lengthened (for the lengthening of word-initial vowels see sec-
tion 2.1.3), and it is followed by a short vowel:
                                                                   2.2 Phonotactics   17(2-30)     a.    /nn/          [n:n]      ‘be sour’
           b.    /++/          [+:+]      ‘be located (at a place)’(There are two verbs with the meaning ‘be located (at a place)’: /++/ and /n++/.
For the latter see [2-29e] further above.)
   Second, when morphemes of the form (C)ViVi are part of a larger word, the
two vowels are retained in almost all cases:(2-31)     a.    /677/ (intr. v.)      /677-+-a/
                 ‘cover os.’           cover-TR-3SG.OBJ
                                       ‘cover him/her/it/           b.    /++/ (intr. v.)      /++-laa/
                 ‘hurt’                hurt-NMLZ
                                       ‘pain’           c.    /baa/              /na=baa/
                 ‘that’             PRF=that
                                    situational demonstrative adverb: PAST.THEN   In a few cases, one of the two identical vowels of the base is not present in a
morphologically complex word, but there is other evidence that there are gemi-
nate vowels in the base. For example, there are two elevational qualifying de-
monstratives, /lnn/ ‘upward’ and /77/ ‘downward’. Historically, they are part
of the presentative locative demonstratives /ln!n/ ‘up there’ and /7!7/ ‘down
there’, respectively, although the origin of the /!n/ and the /!7/ elements is not
known. However, besides /ln!n/ and /7!7/, there are also the forms /lnnr+/ ‘up
there’ and /77r+/ ‘down there’, with geminate vowels, which function as gen-
eral locative demonstratives. The origin of the element /r+/ is not known. And
besides /77r+/, there is also the general locative demonstrative /77baa/ ‘down
there’, which consists of /77/ and the determiner demonstrative /baa/ ‘that’
(see 2-31c) above.
   Third, for the purposes of stress assignment (section 2.3), geminate vowels
count as being in different syllables:(2-32)     a.    /677-+-a/                  [67y7:$+p], not: *[67p:$+]
                 cover.os.-TR-3SG.OBJ
                 ‘cover him/her/it’           b.    /++-laa/                   [+y+:lapa], not *[+p:la:]
                 hurt-NMLZ
                 ‘pain’
18     Phonology
   Finally, evidence that geminate vowels belong in different syllables comes
from a language game, a kind of Pig-Latin, engaged in by children. In this Pig-
Latin, after each syllable an extra syllable is inserted that consist of /m/ and a
copy of the vowel in the preceding syllable:(2-33)       normal Toqabaqita                      Pig-Latin             /n+7/ ‘coconut’                        /n+m+7m7/
             /w'la/ ‘child’                         /w'm'lama/
             /bn6n/ ‘pig’                           /bnmn6nmn/
             /la' ma+/ ‘come here’                  /lama'm' mama+m+/
             go VENT     Words of the phonological shape (C)ViVi are usually treated as disyllabic.(2-34)       normal Toqabaqita                      Pig-Latin             a.    /waa/ ‘worm’                     /wamaama/
             b.    /t77/ ‘heron’                    /t7m77m7/
             c.    /b++/ ‘stone oven’               /b+m++m+/
             d.    /nn/ ‘be sour’                   /nmnnmn/   However, in an elicitation session on Pig-Latin, ViVi sequences in words of
two or more syllables occasionally caused difficulties for the speaker and were
sometimes treated as if they were monosyllabic. For example, /nn/ ‘be sour’
was sometimes made into [nmn:], and /d''/ (intr. v.) ‘fish’ into [d'm':]. In such
“irregular” Pig-Latin equivalents the final vowel was usually, but not always,
lengthened. Sequences of geminate vowels were occasionally treated as if
monosyllabic even when the vowels belong to two different morphemes. The
word for ‘feast’ /aa-a0a-a/ is morphologically complex: the verbal root
/a0a/ ‘eat’ is reduplicated and the redupliant is prefixed, and a suffix /-a/,
which forms deverbal nouns, is added. Both /aa/ sequences were rendered into
Pig-Latin as monosyllabic, even the second one, where the two vowels belong
to two different morphemes: [amaama0ama:], instead of the expected
[amaamaama0amaama]. And /bnnr-a k+l7/ ‘the bottom of a hole’ was ren-
dered as /bnmnrama k+m+l7m7/, rather than /bnmnnmnrama k+m+l7m7/. The /nn/
sequence in /bnnr-a/ is the result of a metathesis. The basic form of the word for
‘bottom’ is /bnrn/. When the third person personal suffix is added to most
nouns that have /r/ or /l/ in their final syllable, the /r/ or /l/ and the vowel of that
syllable metathesize (section 8.1.2); that is, /bnnr-a/, rather than */bnrn-a/ (or
/*bnrn-na/, with the other allomorph of the personal suffix). Nevertheless, the
Pig-Latin speaker treated the /nn/ sequence as if it were monosyllabic. It is con-
                                                                     2.3 Stress   19ceivable there there is an optional alternative rule whereby ViVi sequences are
rendered in Pig-Latin as /VimVi/, with only an /m/ inserted between the two
vowels rather than with two extra syllables.
    All of the evidence for geminate vowels in words of the shape (C)ViVi also
applies to words of more than two syllables. In word-initial ViVi sequences, the
first vowel is long and the second one short: [ny:nm'pa] ‘enemy’, ‘fight, war’. In
words of more than two syllables there would be no reason to lenghthen a
vowel to achieve bimoraicity; and the geminate vowels are retained if the mor-
pheme forms part of a larger word: [7y:7s+p] ‘market’, which consists of /77s+/
‘buy’ and the suffix /-a/, which derives deverbal nouns. ViVi sequences count as
two syllables for stress-assignment purposes: [ny:nm'pa] ‘enemy’, ‘fight, war’,
not *[n:pm'a]; [7y:7s+p] ‘market’, not *[7p:s+]. And ViVi sequences are, or can be,
treated as two syllables in Pig-Latin: /maa-m7/ ‘your (sg) eye’ (/maa/ ‘eye’,
/-m7/ 2sg personal suffix) becomes /mamaamam7m7/.","[43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48]"

Imperatives
20.1.    IntroductionImperative sentences serve to express various kinds of directives (Lyons 1977;
Searle 1979, 1983), such as orders, commands, demands, requests, advice, in-
structions, exhortations, persuasions, incitements, and invitations (Hamblin
1987). Most commonly, imperatives are used to get the addressee or addressees
to do something, but they may be directed at individuals other than the addre-
see(s): at a third person or at the speaker himself/herself. This chapter is con-
cerned with clausal structures, imperatives, that function to express various
kinds of directives. In the present context the term “imperative” is used only
with reference to clauses that function as main clauses, not to clauses embed-
ded under higher verbs that signal the illocutionary force; that is, with reference
to sentences such as the one in (20-1), but not sentences such as the one in (20-
2).","[894, 895]"

Chapter 7
The noun-phrase internal particle group
7.1.    IntroductionNoun phrases may contain one or more postnominal particles that together form
a particle group. For the position of the particle group in a noun phrase see (6-
3) in section 6.1. The particle group may be linked to the preceding element —
the noun or a noun modifier — by means of the ligature ni. Only one instance
of the ligature is possible regardless of the number of particles. However, it is
not common for a particle group to contain more than two particles. A particle
or a combination of particles has the whole noun phrase to its left in its scope.
In (7-1) the noun phrase in the scope of the particle group consists of just a
noun.(7-1)       toqa       ni    sui      bana
            people LIG EXHST          LIM
            ‘all the people’   In (7-2) it is the whole possessive noun phrase that is in the scope of the
particle group, not just the pronoun:(7-2)       [ai nia] ni         laqu boqo
            wife 3SG LIG ADD ASRT
            ‘his wife as well [in addition to one or more other people]’   The particle group in (7-3) contains three particles, and there is no ligature:(7-3)       kera sui        bo=naqa
            3PL EXHST       ASRT=INTS
            ‘all of them’   The noun-phrase particles are listed in table 7.1 in the order in which they
occur in noun phrases. (This is also the order in which they are discussed.)
Those that occupy the same position in the group and so are mutually exlusive
are listed under the same letter.

            kau             andative   With one exception, all the members of the noun-phrase particle group also
function as particles in the verb complex (chapter 5), and in most cases the
functions of a given particle in the two types of phrase are very similar. The
particle that does not occur in the verb complex is the intensifier qana. And
with the exception of the particles tona, toneqe, all those that occur in verb
phrases are postverbal, and they are postnominal in noun phrases. Tona and
toneqe are preverbal and prenominal.
   It is necessary to distinguish situations where a particle functions as a noun-
phrase particle and has the whole noun phrase in its scope and those where a
particle is a verb-complex particle and has a verb that modifies a noun (section
6.10) in its scope. In (7-4) naqa functions as a noun-phrase particle and has the
whole possessive noun phrase in its scope:(7-4)       … [qiiqisi-la-na      fa           ngali qeri naqa]     na

only the verb mae in its scope:(7-5)       Kafa      qeri, wane [mae  naqa]           n=e

             ‘I saw your brother at the market place.’   Verbs can be accompanied by a variety of particles, some of which precede
the verb and some of which follow. In noun phrases most of the modifiers are
postnominal, but some are prenominal. All of the adpositions are prepositions.
   To the extent that the relations betweens heads and their dependents are
overtly marked, Toqabaqita is predominantly head-marking in the terminology
of Nichols (1986). Direct objects are indexed on the verb; see (3-5) above.
Clausal direct objects are indexed on the higher verb. In (3-6) the complement
clause is in brackets:(3-6)        Nau ku              thathami-a       [kwai      fanga].

             ‘I want to eat.’ (Lit.: ‘I want I will eat.’)    In two types of noun phrase, associative and possessive, the head noun car-
ries a suffix that marks the relation, an associative suffix in the former, as in (3-
7), and a personal suffix in the latter, as in (3-8):
                                                3.1 Morphosyntactic patterns   45(3-7)      thaalu-qi     geo

           child-3.PERS child      this
           ‘this child’s mother’   Two classes of prepositions take suffixes to index their objects. One takes
personal suffixes also used on the possessum nouns in one type of possessive
construction to index the possessor:(3-9)      qi    a-na           wane      qena
           LOC REC-3.PERS       man       that(2)
           ‘[give some areca nuts] to the man’   Compare (3-8) further above.
   The other subclass takes object suffixes also used with one class of transi-
tive verbs to index the direct objects:(3-10)     uri-a        ifu-na           qaburu baa
           ALL-3.OBJ hair-3.PERS         ogre   that
           ‘[reach] for the ogre’s hair’   Compare (3-5) further above.
   Some of the forms that function as prepositions and take object suffixes can
also take clauses as their objects and may index them with the same suffix -a:(3-11)     Nau ku            too          naqa [uri-a     kwai    lae].

   Those heads of phrases that index their dependents can have only lexical
noun phrase modifiers (or clause modifiers), not pronominal modifiers. The
possessive noun phrase in (3-12) is ungrammatical because of the presence of
the pronoun in the possessor position:

   And (3-13) is ungrammatical because of the pronoun in the direct object
position:(3-13)     Qo          riki-a        (*nia)?
           2SG.NFUT see-3SG.OBJ 3SG
           ‘Did you see him/her/it?’    Compare (3-5) further above with a lexical direct object. For the difference
in the glossing of the suffix -a, 3.OBJ in (3-5) and 3SG.OBJ in (3-13), see below.
    Those types of heads that index their adjuncts or complements can occur
without an adjunct or a complement, as (3-12) and (3-13) above show. Under
such circumstances the object and the personal suffixes specify the person and
the number of the participant. This is shown in (3-14) and (3-15) for the third
person singular and plural object suffixes, respectively, and in (3-16) and (3-17)
for the third person singular and dual personal suffixes, respectively:(3-14)     Nau ku             rongo-a.

           picture-3DU.PERS
           ‘their picture’ (that is, a picture that depicts the two of them)    However, when a lexical complement is present, the number contrast is neu-
tralized, and the singular suffixes are used regardless of the grammatical num-
ber of the dependent. Because here the suffixes do not mark the number, the
number is not specified in the glosses.

           picture-3.PERS    two man
           ‘picture of two men’   That is, the object and the personal suffixes are bifunctional: they index
lexical noun phrase complements with respect to person; and they can function
as a kind of bound pronominal, the only exponent of an argument. In the latter
function, like the independent pronouns, they express both the person and the
number; and they are mutually exclusive with the corresponding independent
pronouns in encoding one and the same participant in a phrase.
   One exception to the head-marking pattern is relative clauses. Marking of
the positions relativized takes place inside relative clauses. In (3-22) the posi-
tion relativized is direct object, and the transitive verb in the relative clause
carries the object suffix -a:(3-22)     subi            na     tha        Fiuoomea qe

           make-TR-3SG.OBJ
           ‘the subi club that Fiuoomea made’   The other exception to the head-marking pattern involves the sole adjective
‘small, little’. The adjective has three different forms, two of which vary de-
pending on the grammatical number of the phrase, singular or plural:(3-23)     kali       wela naqi
           little.SG child this
           ‘this little child’
48   Grammatical profile
(3-24)     kaala wela naqi ki
           little.PL child this PL
           ‘these little children’   Lexical noun phrases make a singular – plural number distinction. The sin-
gular is formally unmarked, while the plural is marked by the particle ki; com-
pare (3-23) and (3-24) above. However, the plural marker is not always present
even if the number is plural. The personal pronouns, the subject markers, the
object suffixes, and the personal suffixes make a three-way number distinction:
singular, dual, and plural. The forms in (3-25) are the third person independent
personal pronouns:(3-25)     a.    nia
                 3SG
                 ‘he/she/it’           b.    keeroqa

                 ‘they (two)’           c.    kera
                 3PL
                 ‘they (more than two)’   Not infrequently, however, with third-person referents when the number of
referents is two, the plural pronoun, subject marker, object suffix, or personal
suffix is used in place of the dual form.
   The pronouns, the subject markers, the personal suffixes, and the object
suffixes have inclusive forms in the dual and the plural. The inclusive is not
considered here a first-person form (cf. Daniel [2005]), and so there is no speci-
fication of the person in the glosses.5 The forms in (3-26) are the plural per-
sonal suffixes:(3-26)     a.    thaina-kuluqa
                 mother-PL(INCL).PERS
                 ‘our mother’           b.    thaina-miliqa

type of possessive construction. The choice between the two constructions is
sensitive to the type of relation between the possessum and the possessor: inal-
ienable vs. alienable, as in (3-27) and (3-28), respectively.(3-27) thaina-da
       mother-3PL.PERS
       ‘their mother’(3-28) biqu     kera
       house 3PL
       ‘their house’    However, there are some lexical exceptions, with certain nouns signifying
inalienable relations being treated grammatically the way that nouns that sig-
nify alienable relations are, and, furthermore, the notion of individuation of the
possessum also plays a role in the choice of a construction.
    At the level of the clause, three types of grammatical relations are distin-
guished: subject, direct object, and oblique object. Oblique objects can be com-
plements or adjuncts. Oblique objects are headed by prepositions, but the
preposition is sometimes omitted with locative and temporal phrases when its
absence does not result in (significant) loss of information. The allative prepo-
sition uri is present with the locative-goal interrogative phrase in (3-29a), but
not in the synonymous (3-29b):(3-29)     a.    Qo         lae uri fei?

                 2SG.NFUT go where
                 ‘Where are you going?’   And the general preposition qana is present with the temporal phrase ‘this
time’ in (3-30), but not in (3-31). In (3-30) the preposition has fused with the
partitive marker si and has the form qa=, rather than qana.","[73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78]"

purpose clauses. Some of these verbs are transitive where it is the direct object
that is co-referential with the subject of the purpose clause. Such verbs can take
purpose nominalizations instead. They function as “object-control” verbs: it is
their direct object that corresponds to the notional subject of the nominaliza-
tion. Kwaathata ‘choose, appoint sb. to do st.’ is one such verb. In (33-86) the

clause, while in (33-87) kwaathata has a purpose nominalization as an oblique

Chapter 34
Consequence clauses
To express the fact that one state of affairs is the consequence of another state
of affairs, the form adelana is used to introduce the clause that expresses the
consequence. Adelana is a nominalization of the Class 1 transitive verb ade
‘do’, with the third person (singular) personal suffix -na: ade-la-na ‘its doing’,
‘doing of it’. Example (34-1) shows ade as a transitive verb:(34-1)     Taa     n=o                  ade-a?
           what? FOC=2SG.NFUT           do-3SG.OBJ
           ‘What are you doing?’   In its consequence-marking function the nominalization ade-la-na is treated
as an unanalyzed whole: adelana. However, even though adelana has a gram-
matical function of signalling consequence, it exhibits nominal properties: it
can be placed in focus, and it can be accompanied by certain particles that oc-
cur in noun phrases.
   As discussed in section 19.3.8, the nominalization ade-la-na is used in one
type of open interrogative to inquire about what led to a certain state of affairs.
There ade-la-na does function as a nominalization: it is the subject of the inter-
rogative predicate ‘be located where?’. There is a close link between the conse-
quence-marking function discussed in this chapter and the function of ade-la-
na in such interrogatives: ‘How did that come about that such and such is the
case?’. However, in the consequence-marking function, adelana does not func-
tion as an argument of a verb.
   Grammatically positive consequence clauses normally contain the appropri-
ate sequential subject marker, unless the imperfective subject marker is called
for. Grammatically negative consequence clauses contain the appropriate nega-
tive subject marker.
   Consequence clauses are normally, but not always (see further below), ac-
companied by a clause that states the reason for, or the cause of, the consequent
state of affairs. The order of the two clauses may be iconic or non-iconic: rea-
son/cause clause – consequence clause, or consequence clause – reason/cause
clause, respectively. When the clause of reason/cause precedes the consequence
clause, the two clauses are in asyndetic coordination with each other.
