"     The sense is deciphered by noting which case (object or dative) the non-1st
person clitic is in, then inferring the grammatical function of the ambiguous 1st
person clitic. In (685.a), the final -\tt is a 3Sg object form, so the ambiguous
lSg Λα-hi- is interpreted as a dative. In (685.b), the final -\ha-s is a 3Sg
dative, so the ambiguous lSg Λα-hi- is interpreted as an object pronominal. In
both types, informants normally reject suggested alternatives with the lSg
clitic following the non-lst person clitic. Thus #i-waet-\t-\ha-hi for (685.a) and
#i-wast-\a-s-\ha-hi for (685.b) were usually expressly rejected, though very
rarely such a combination did occur in paradigmatic elicitation.
     However, in some combinations it is possible for a 1st person dative clitic
to follow a 3rd person object clitic. Consider (686), attested in T-md and K-d.
                                                  10.4 Ordering of clitics   613(686)   i-qre-\n-\ha-hi
        3MaSgS-kill.PerfP-\3MaP10-\Dat-lSg
        'He killed them-Ma for me.' (T-md)     Here the 3MaPl object has a reduced, arguably V-initial allomorph (/-aen-/)
after the V-final verb (-sgra-), and we get VV-Contraction with /a-ae/
surfacing as e. It appears that this ""fusion"" of object clitic with stem-final V
permits an exception to the first person first rule. However, even here, some
speakers including my primary T-ka informant strongly prefer to allow the first
person first rule to apply, so instead of (686) they have i-qYCi-\0-hi-\taen, with
3MaP10 -\taen at the end.
     In the combinations not involving a 1st person clitic, the common
sequence is dative-object. In other words, the object-2 slot is favored for
object clitics. One can account for the data by recognizing (684.b) as the basic
order, while allowing for subsequent ""fronting"" of a lSg or 1P1 form to initial
position within the clitic cluster. However, there are also some attestations of
object-dative order even when a 1st person clitic is not involved, so the
ordering is not rigid.
     In the uncommon case where two objects and one dative co-occur, the two
object clitics flank the dative clitic, so we get object-dative-object order.
     Some further examples each involving one dative clitic and one object
clitic are in (687). The verb glossed 'kill' can also mean 'hit hard, whack'.
(687.a-b) include a 1st person, while the others do not.(687)   a.      waer-\hl-\tt                   i-ηγα

occasionally recorded examples where one pronominal clitic follows the
particle and the other follows the verb. This is the case in (688.a), an optional

  Discourse-functional particles and topicalization
11.1    TopicalizationA topicalized constituent can be placed before the clause proper. It has its own
accentuation in this position, may have ""comma"" intonation, and is essentially
external to the clause. If the referent in question is subject, object, etc., it is
expressed by a pronominal in the clause proper. In (689.a-b), the topicalized
nouns (masculine and feminine, respectively), correspond to the object clitics
within the clause proper.(689)    a.      e-haen    [ajbar-aen-\t                       am-an]

"(7)     [X Y'...]where X is a phrase- or clause-initial element (word or particle), Y' is an
immediately following word, and Y' is a modification in the form of the
corresponding independent form Y. ""Immediately following"" means that no
word or fixed-order particle intervenes, though floating clitics that happen to
attach to X are allowed. I refer to the relation between X and Y' as a local
dependency. The relevant constructions are in (8), where ""verb"" refers to
inflected (=finite) verbs, and ""participle"" (used in subject relatives) is a special
form of a verb stem with subject number-gender agreement only.",[30]
"    In cases like (831-2), it is not meaningful to speak of (morphosyntactic)
conjunction. Extraction processes such as focalization do not treat such
sequences as single clauses. In (833), note that the extracted (i.e. focalized) ma
'what?' is repeated. In other words, there is an ""island"" constraint on simple
extraction from a biclausal sequence.(833)   [ma      i-tatt]             [ma    i-sdss]

        'What does he eat, what does he drink?' (= 'What does he eat and
        drink?')
13.5     Verbs with verbal noun complementsVerbs with VblN complements require that the (logical) subject of the VblN
clause be coindexed with a NP in the higher clause (usually the subject, but the
object for certain higher-clause verbs). The subject of the VblN clause is
therefore omitted. If the VblN has a NP object, the latter usually appears as a
genitive NP with Poss preposition an (example below with 'be ashamed').
However, some higher-clause verbs can alternatively take the logical lower-
clause object as a direct complement (see 'begin', below).
684      13 Clausal subordination13.5.1         'prevent' (-vkkvs-)In the construction glossable 'X prevent [Y do...]', Tamashek expresses the
lower subject (Y) as a main-clause dative. This allows the complement to be
expressed as a VblN with no further marking of the subject. The verb -vkkvs-
has a primary sense 'take out, take away, remove', so the construction is
literally ""X take.away [to (=from) X] [doing...].""(834)     a.     l-kkaes-\a-s

                  Ί prevented him from slaughtering the sheep.'
13.5.2     'cease' (-vbdu-), 'leave' (-uyyu-) and 'begin' (-s-vnti>)If the complement clause functions as the complement of a preposition in the
main clause, we get constructions like (835). Here the matrix verb is -vbdu-
'be separated from', in context here 'cease'.(835)     war ""i-bsddu                               ad     ""t-se-haela

                                13.5 Verbs with verbal noun complements     685    The transitive verb 'begin' is -s-vnti>, (Imprt s-aent, PerfP -sss-anta-). It
can take a VblN or similar nominal as complement. In (837.b) we see that the
logical object of the complement verb is expressed as (clitic) object of 'begin'.(837)    a.      ά-janna       i-ss-anta               e-wet

13.5.3    'go (in order) to' (-vkki>)Since -vkku- 'go to' is a transitive verb, it can take a simple VblN (without
preposition) as its complement. Often the pragmatic sense is 'go in order to'.(838)    1-kka              t-e-taete

13.5.4    'be ashamed to' (-kvrukvd-)-kvrukvd- 'be ashamed' can take a VblN complement. In (839), the VblN

clause it is a preverbal particle (if present), otherwise it is the verb. In a relative

but the demonstrative of a definite relative. In focalized and some subordinated

(relatives §12.1, focalized clauses §12.2), and in subordinated clauses that
regularly include a cliticized Instrumental or Comitative preposition
(§13.1.1-2), the preposition cliticizes to the host (and precedes any other

location for pronominal clitics (object, dative). In (68l.b), we have an even
more complex sequence with cliticized preposition, dative pronominal, object
pronominal, and directional. For further detail on the relative ordering of
object and dative clitics when more than one is present, see (684) below.
     Directional clitics follow pronominals. The two directionals (Centripetal
Asdd or -\idd, and Centrifugal -Yin) are semantically incompatible and do not
co-occur. Both directionals have marked accents, unlike other clitics (which
have at most default accents). In (681.a), Centrip Aadd appears at the end of
the second word, then again (redundantly) on the third word. A simpler

demonstrative adverb as the head, followed by cliticized Comit -\d. The
construction can be glossed literally ""here/there where ..."". The unmarked
adverbial in this construction is d-i-ha 'here'.(803)    a.       s-sens                    t-äe-hon-t

treatment typical of 3SgS LoImpfP verbs in definite relative clauses (compare
-t-attaes- in normal LoImpfP clauses). See χ-pcl Erasure (130).
     There is frequent slippage of spatial into temporal contexts, or into more
abstract spatiotemporal or situational 'in the event that ...'. These clauses can
therefore abut on the domain of conditional antecedents.(804)    a.      ad        0-asts                          X

Canonically, it begins with y (prevocalic Dative allomorph), followed by the
unmarked demonstrative a, then any clitics. If there is no other clitic, Comit
-\d is added, then the remainder of the clause, with a Shlmpf verb. In other
words, this is a PP with a clause headed by Dem ά as the complement of the
preposition.
     Since the purposive clause is finite, its form does not depend on whether
its subject is coindexed with the subject of the main clause. Thus (806.a-b)
have the same purposive clause ('that he see me'), though only in (806.a) is the
subject 'he' coindexed with the main-clause subject.(806)    a.     0-osa-\hl-\dd

672     13 Clausal subordination     The danger of confusing Future ad with the unmarked Dem ά of a relative
clause is especially great in this construction. When a clitic follows, Fut ad
reduces to ä- (§9.6.3), and Dem ά omits the following Comit -\d. If there is no
clitic, Fut ad is unreduced and Dem ά is followed by Comit -\d. One
diagnostic for Fut ad is a following Shlmpf verb, but the purposive too has a
Shlmpf verb.
     However, the α in (806.a-c) before the clitic is clearly the Dem morpheme,
and phonetic [ad] in (806.d) is Dem a plus Comit -\d, not Future ad. The
Future morpheme would have been replaced by its non-clause-initial
counterparts (T-ka mar, R and K-d e) in this position. Furthermore, when the
purposive clause is negative there is no possibility of a future (mis-)reading

(almost) generalize that when a short (or deletable) V and a full V come
together (in either order) the full V survives intract (except when stem-final

all verb plus suffix/clitic data but not (quite) for the verb plus Centripetal clitic
case /a + a/ - » ae (41.d) unless supplemented by a later shortening rule.
     (42) summarizes the cases where an intervening C breaks up the VV
cluster and obviates the need for VV-Contraction. The T-ka cases with h are
best handled as suffixal allomorph rules, while the eastern pattern with
homorganic semivowel is more phonological in nature.","[78, 79, 80]"

8.6     Verbal nouns8.6.1     Ordinary verbal nounsA pure VblN is a nominal that denotes the relevant action or state in an
unbounded fashion: 'dancing', 'running', etc. The VblN often occurs as a
complement to a higher verb like 'begin', 'be/do a lot', or 'be ashamed to'
(§13.5). The larger construction often imposes a temporal bounding. VblN's
are also indispensable in cases where a verb (or VP) is focalized; in this case,
the verb is extracted and fronted in the form of a VblN, and its original place is
occupied by -vju- 'do, make' (§12.2.5). Some main-clause verbs ('prevent',
 'begin', 'cease', 'go (in order to)', 'be ashamed to', 'do a lot', 'do many
times', 'do frequently') take VblN's as complements (§13.5). A VblN may
also be the subject of a clause.
      The various types of light verb stem tend to have idiosyncratic VblN stem
shapes that cannot be unified into a single overall ablaut model. Since each
VblN pattern is associated with a specified stem shape, we can think of these
as cases of templatic rather than componential ablaut. That is, the lexical
segments (chiefly C's) are simply mapped into the C positions of the VblN
template. I will not bother to formalize these minor ablaut mapping patterns,
which should be readily apparent. On the other hand, heavy verbs (including
prefixed derivatives) do lend themselves to a componential ablaut model
(§8.6.1.4), with a basic vocalic melody and (for non-augment verbs) a
penultimate accent.
      Most verbs have a basic masculine verbal noun (VblN) belonging to one
of the productive patterns described below.
      There is often a feminine counterpart, with FeSg t-...-(t-)t or FePl
t-...-(t-)en circumfixed around the same stem that is used in the masculine
VblN. There are also various other nominals, usually feminine, that can be
used in verbal noun sense at least for specified verbs. Where the masculine
VblN has an exact feminine counterpart, the latter may function as an
instantiating VblN (denoting a single instance of the verbal type, e.g.
                                                      8.6 Verbal nouns       507feminine 'a jab' in contrast to temporally unbounded masculine 'jabbing').
Alternatively, the feminine VblN may have a more concrete sense (e.g. 'a
refusal', 'an entrance'); the nuances are specific to particular word-families.
For example, (PerfP) -vljvm- 'hit lightly on the nape' has a regular masculine
VblN a-laejam denoting the pure, unbounded action type, and a feminine
nominal t-a-lajjem-t denoting an individual blow on the nape. Likewise,
-urvm- (PerfP -orsem-) 'try, attempt' has a masculine VblN irrum 'trying', and
a feminine noun t-irrum-t (T-ka) or t-irmi-t-t (A-grm K-d) '(an) attempt'.
Some word-families contain several nominals, masculine and/or feminine.
    For some verbs, especially those of basic shape -v(C)Ci> or -U(C)CÜ-,
there is no masculine VblN. For these verbs, one of the feminine nominals
functions as VblN (e.g. as complement to a higher verb), whether or not it also
has a more concrete sense.
    A VblN may have a ""possessor"" denoting the object (536).(536)   a.      t-e-naere              an        t-aellaem-t

generate the correct forms in (138) if the order of rules is χ-Erasure, then
Default Accentuation, then VV-Contraction. However, this would decouple
χ-Erasure from VV-Contraction, in spite of the evidence in (137) for a

           Verb phrases and other predications
9.1 Voice (valency) types of verbs9.1.1   Subject and objectThere is one subject NP in each clause. There may also be one direct object NP
(with verbs like 'give', the recipient may appear as a second direct object NP
under limited conditions, §9.1.6). Other NP's occur as PP's or as adverbials.
Except when focalized or topicalized, all NP's (and PP's) follow the verb. If
all arguments are expressed as nonpronominal NP's, the order is VSOX, where
X is everything else.
     The subject is always expressed as a pronominal subject affix on the verb.
If it is also expressed as a noun (or NP), this immediately follows the verb
(unless fronted by focalization or topicalization). A verb plus a following
subject noun is treated as a single accentual phrase, so if the noun is mono- or
bisyllabic and has no lexical accent, a phrasal accent appears on the final
syllable of the verb. In addition, nouns that begin with a gender-number suffix
(MaSg α-, MaPl i-, FeSg t-α-, FePl t-i-), i.e. the majority of nouns, undergo
Prefix Reduction when in subject function following the verb (§3.5.1). The
reductions, which apply more generally to nouns in ""dependent"" state (hence
also in possessive constructions or after a preposition), are repeated in (606).","[590, 591, 592]"
"
4.1.2     Morphology of gender and number markingThe maximal structure of an inflected noun is (140), in the linear order shown.",[181]
"
3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processesThere is a pervasive interaction between ""syntax"" and ""phonology"" in
Tamashek, which allows us to make a strong case for a morphological view of
the grammar. That is, instead of a model of grammar that starts with an
autonomous abstract syntax, and then allows a phonological module to execute
more or less natural phonological adjustments to the outputs of the syntax,
Tamashek lends itself to a model where grammatical categories, linear
ordering, and phonology (segmental, accentual, and ablaut) are inextricably
intertwined.
    The common denominator of the phenomena treated in this section is a
repeating ""figure"" of the type [X+Y...], where X is some phrase-initial word or
particle, and Y is a word whose phonological form is modified in this syntactic
context. The modifications of Y are mostly, but not always, interpretable as
reductions. The [X+Y...] groupings do not correspond to phrasal boundaries in
current formal syntactic models. For example, the combination [verb
+ subject] (excluding object) is not recognized as a phrase in any syntactic
theory I know of. Therefore even the phrasal bracketings relevant to the
morphophonological processes described here are idiosyncratic to Tamashek.
On top of this, the phrasal bracketings are not identical to those needed for
phrasal accent. For example, [verb + object] counts as a phrase for
accentuation, as does [verb + subject], but of the two only [verb + subject}
shows Prefix Reduction in the noun. Therefore converting ""syntactic"" phrases
to ""prosodic"" phrases by rebracketing, as a way of explaining how Tamashek
microsyntactic organization diverges from natural syntactic groups, will not
                     3.5 Syntactically controlled phonological processes       147work, at least if ""prosodic"" phrases are defined in a manner relevant to actual
prosody.","[165, 166]"
"Under this rubric I consider stems with Imprt shapes like the following (v =
short vowel): bisyllabic -Cv(C)CvC- with three C-positions; trisyllabic
-Cv(C)CvCCvC- with four C-positions; and the infrequent quadrisyllable
-CvCvCCv(C)CvC- with five C-positions. All of these are heavy verbs. Those
with three C-positions are more specifically middleweight, and those with
four or more C-positions are superheavy (§3.4.1.4).
     The first and last C-positions in the Imprt in the verbs considered here are
filled by single C's. In my lexicographic data, it appears that in superheavy
stems the third C-position must be a cluster. Since few verbs with five
C-positions are attested, there may be an accidental gap regarding C versus CC
in the second C-position.
     Superheavy stems may be full or partial reduplications, and may have an
internal geminate, but internal structure is irrelevant to MAN stem formation
and inflection.
     Representative paradigm schemas are given in (349), again using Ρ to
index the stem-initial C, in order to make gemination and syncope effects
transparent. Note that except for the Resit of -Cv(C)CvC- verbs, the
underlying marked grammatical accents of the Resit and LoImpfP are in the
third or fourth syllable from the right and are therefore overridden (or made
redundant) by Default Accentuation.",[364]
"    A very common construction for reciprocals expressing other than subject-
object coindexation involves a distributive subject ('each X') and the
possessed form of ά-m-idi 'friend' in the relevant non-subject position. In
context, the second referent can be translated 'the other' (892.a). The verb
underlying Agentive ά-m-idi is 'accompany' (PerfP -aeddew-, Imprt Idaw),
and the verb itself can be used in constructions translatable with 'together'
(892.b).

The following text was recorded from a T-ka speaker in 2002. It was
transcribed from dictation, allowing the speaker to repeat the sentences. My
other textual material is transcribed from recorded dialogues, and the reason
for choosing monologue dictation in this case was to allow the speaker to
smooth out the accentual phrasing (which can be ragged in spontaneous
dialogue due to the fact that phrasal accents work from right to left. Where
they are clear, I use brackets here to indicate the accentual phrases of more
than one word, not (as in the grammar proper) to indicate syntactic bracketing.(894)   [kaslaAtt        sllae-n]             assin       medd-aen,

2.11   Representation of stemsFor nouns (and other non-verb stems), what you see is what you get. The Sg
form of the noun is the citation form. Most Sg nouns (masculine or feminine)
have a vocalic prefix, such as Sg -a- or -as-, preceding the noun stem. A
masculine example is α-basqkor 'old well'. Feminine nouns also normally
have a Fe prefix t-, and often FeSg suffix -t. An example is t-a-bsqqan-t
'burrgrass'. The χ accent indicates that penultimate accent is predictable from
the presence of suffix -t, which does not permit the usual antepenultimate
default accent.
     For verbs, the true citation form makes use of ""v"" for short vowel, ""υ"" for
full vowel, and where appropriate more specific full vowels (usually u and i).
If the verb takes Augment -t-, the formula ""(+ -t)"" is added. The PerfP or Imprt
may be used as an informal citation form in some contexts (the PerfP is used as
the headword in the dictionary). Examples of the true citation form are -vwvt-
'hit' (PerfP -awaet-), -usvl- 'run' (PeriP -osael-), and -buffu- (+ -t) '(grain) be
abundant' (PerfP -abbuffae-t).
     Verb classes (as opposed to individual stems) are represented as e.g.
-vCvC-, -vPPvC-, and -vPQvC-. Ρ and Q represent consonants, with PP a
geminate cluster and PQ a nongeminate cluster. In other words, Ρ and Q are
indexes of identity among C's. The same class may be represented as e.g.
-vCvC- or -vPvC- depending on context. For example, it may be stated that
-vPvC- has a LoImpfP stem -aPPdC-, using Ρ in -vPvC- in order to clarify the
source of the geminate in -aPPdC-.",[40]

1.1 Tuareg and Berber linguisticsThe Berber family is part of the Afro-Asiatic (or Hamito-Semitic) phylum (1).","[5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20]"

2.7 CliticsClitics are attached to the leftmost word of the clause (a complementizer, a
preverbal particle like Neg or Fut, a clause-initial verb, the head noun in an
indefinite relative clause, the demonstrative in a definite relative clause or in a
focalized clause). Head nouns of definite relatives, focalized constituents, and
topicalized constituents are treated as external to the clause and therefore do
not host clitics. I use the notation -\ for the boundary between a clitic and a
preceding word or clitic.
    In a transitive clause, if the direct object is expressed by a pronoun, it
takes the form of an object clitic (16).(16)    t-3nhasy-\taen                   Vse-mast-t

12.2.3     Focalization of prepositional complementFocalization of a prepositional complement NP follows the same linear-order
pattern as with relativization, except that the verb has its full form (with all
relevant ablaut features). The ""preposition"" has now cliticized to the ά at the
front of the clause (750.a). Dative is merged with Instrumental as As in this
construction (750.b-c), as in relatives. Note the fortuitous similarity between
the resulting a-\s (Foe + Preposition) and 3MaSg dative clitic -\a-s. For other
uses of a-\s in focalization, see §12.2.6 below. (750.d) has fael 'on'.(750)    a.      i-borsy-aen           [a-\s         n-sssirael]

like (covert) comitative phrases, so cliticized Comitative preposition -\d
appears after Foe ά. As in other spatiotemporals, -\d is omitted in the presence
of any other clitic (751.c).(751)    a.      d-i-hd-dasr         [a-\d             n-9SS3Yael]

7.3.1.5    Heavy non-augment V-final -CvCCv- and -CvCvCCv-There are also some non-augment heavy V-final verbs. The number of such
stems is low, and they are dwarfed in number by the open-ended class of heavy
augmented verbs (§7.3.1.6, below). Schematic MAN-stem paradigms are in
(368). Ρ denotes the first C, in order to make C,-Gemination transparent.

    The middleweight stems and the superheavy stems have quite distinct
perfective and imperfective melodies. The middleweight type shows
C,-Gemination in the perfectives and in the inflectable Shlmpf, while the
superheavy type shows Stem-Initial Syncope (§3.4.8.1). In melodies and
treatment of the initial C (""P""), the middleweight type -PvCCu- matches such
C-final types as -Pv(C)CvC- and -PvCCv(C)CvC-, while the superheavy type
-PvCvCCu- matches C-final types like -PvCv(C)CvC- (§7.3.1.2, above).

variants with α rather than a in the final syllable, like a-mlawlaw, since this
change does not affect accent.)
     In (93.b), we have apparent final-syllable accent, but this is due to deletion
of a stem-final V, compare LoImpfP -t-lmtalli- and PerfP -aemtaella-. If we
order the association of χ-pen to the stem before Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29),
the form will come out correctly.
     (93.c) shows that augment verbs, i.e. verbs that take Augment -t in most

in perfectives, another large set of verbs has a stem-wide <L> perfective
melody. The issue to be discussed here is whether the <L> melody can be
reduced to <H L>. Since the stems in question have at least two syllables, and
usually three or more, there is no obvious reason why the Η component of
<H L> should be unable to associate audibly with at least the stem-initial
syllable. However, the <H> melody is in a one-to-one relationship (in T-ka and
other dialects, except A-grm). Given this correlation, the possibility of a
phonological motivation for the <H> perfective melody should be considered.
    I will exclude from this discussion the unusual perfectives of adjectival
verbs. These adjectival perfectives are typically C-initial (§7.3.1.11), but
nonetheless fail to accept subject prefixes, including 3MaSg i-. Many of these
adjectival perfectives have stem-wide (usually bisyllabic) <H> vocalism, but
others have <L> vocalism. The perfective stems of these adjectival verbs often
diverge sharply in shape from imperfectives, and generally behave as
lexicalized, idiosyncratic perfective stems. I choose not to decompose them
into ablaut components.
    With the adjectival stems excluded, we turn to examples like those in (94).","[139, 140]"

to reconcile the surface final-syllable accent of these VblN's with the
penultimate marked accent of the VblN's already presented in this section, by
ordering Default Accentuation before Stem-Final i/A-Deletion. There is no

Resit always respects the shape of the PerfP, the most basic form of the
perfective system. The χ-pcl and χ-pcl formatives therefore follow a CC
cluster in verbs like 'get' and 'be enough'. In the long imperfectives, on the
other hand, there is always a V after the first C of the stem, or (if present) after
the -t- prefix. This means that the input to some of the long imperfectives must
be reconfigured (§3.4.1.5, above) from the usual shape seen in the perfectives
and short imperfectives. For example, -vjrvw- 'get' is reconfigured as -jvrvw-,
and -vbsi> 'vomit' as -bvsu-, in order for the ablaut formatives to apply
properly as they are formulated here. For light stems like these, one could also
consider a templatic model for the long imperfectives, which might obviate
this problem. However, the heavy stems are easily generated by taking the
Shlmpf as the input to LoImpfP ablaut.
    For the most part, χ-pcl and χ-pcl target the same vowel, to the point
where one might consider merging them into a single formative. However,
cases like the Resit of 'be enough' in (89) show that χ-pcl can occur in the
absence of χ-pcl, in connection with adjectival verbs as illustrated here, but
also in definite relative clauses where χ-pcl is erased. See just below on
""jurisdictional"" issues between ""first postconsonantal V"" and ""V of final
syllable of stem.""
118       3 Phonology3.4.5.3     Final-Syllable   V (""f')The formatives in (88.b), above, target the V of the final syllable of the stem.
This is a simple and unproblematic formulation. The clear cases of χ-f in verbs
are illustrated in (91).","[136, 137]"

            -νΐΐυ-                'exist' (usually Resit -slid-)
            -vbu-                 'lose'    -vkku- 'go to' is the 'go' verb used with a specified destination, which is
expressed as the direct object. A PerfP example with object NP is t-akka
e-haen 'she went to the house'. Note that the object NP has no locative
preposition. The destination can also be expressed as an object clitic:
Skkas-nAt 'they-Ma went to him'. The verb can be passivized: 0-aetw-aekka
'he was gone to'. A reciprocal version: aenm-äekkas-n 'they went to each
other'. A different verb -vjlu- expresses intransitive 'go, go away, depart' with
no specified destination.
    Likewise, -vfvl- 'go from, leave' takes an object NP denoting the
departure point. Example: i-faelAad baemasko 'he left Bamako (on the way
576     9 Verb phrases and other predicationshere)'. -\ad(d) here is the Centripetal clitic. This transitive verb, along with the
use of preposition r o r 'chez, at the place of in composite 'from X to Y'
adverbial expressions (§6.7), makes an ablative preposition unnecessary, and
Tamashek has none.
     -vwvr- 'be on' takes a direct object, rather than a PP, to specify the object
or surface on which the subject rests. In the (positive) stative sense it occurs in
the Resit form -awdr-. An example with full noun as object: i-war t-s-hun-t
'he is on the stone'. An example with object clitic is i-wdr-\t 'he is on it-Ma'.
The passive sounded dubious to informants, but I was able to elicit a reciprocal
-nvm-vwvr-, 3MaPl PerfP: aenm-aewaer-aen 'they were on each other'.
     -vhi> 'be in' takes an object NP denoting the object, region, or space in
which the subject is located. Example: n-aha e-haen 'we are in the house'. The
verb can also be used in extended senses of the type 'be produced (caused) by'.
Example: i-h-\e a-s-assuhu η Vrazzej 'strengthening of the livestock is in
(=is brought about by) it (=a pasture grass sp.)'. In positive main clauses it is
always in the Resit form, -vhu- is a defective verb with no imperfective stems
(§7.3.2.12). It occurs in many idiomatic phrases, for example with a nominal
denoting a personality trait or other characteristic as subject, and a human NP
as object, e.g. t-ah-\e ""t-ae-haeke 'he is generous' (lit. ""giving is in him"").
     Another defective transitive verb is -νΐυ- 'have', the ordinary verb of
possession. It too appears (in positive sentences) in the Resit form -aid-. See
§7.3.2.14. One can extract the object to give sentences like e-haen miAtH-las-n
'the house [topic], who has it?' (i.e. 'to whom does the house belong?'). For an
alternative construction 'X be mine' etc. see §9.4.
     Still another defective transitive verb is -νΐΐυ-, which combines with a
referentially empty 3MaSg object clitic to form an existential sense 'exist,
there is/are'. See §9.3, below, and §7.3.2.11 for the irregular morphology and
the dialectally variable omission or reinterpretation of the 3MaSg clitic.
     The sense 'get lost' is expressed as (PerfP) 0-aeba-, with invariant 3MaSg
subject form (here 0 - before a) plus an object NP or clitic denoting the person
or object lost. Example: 0-aeba-\taet 'she got lost', also a common polite
expression for 'she died'. The 3MaSg subject is audible as i- in LoImpfP
i-t-iba-\taen 'they are (often) lost'. See §7.3.2.16 for more forms of this
defective verb.","[594, 595]"
"
3.5.1   Prefix Reduction of nouns (dependent state)An important morphological process affecting nouns is that associated with
dependent state (in French usually « etat d'annexion »). This ""state"" is a
cover term for the following syntactic positions: a) complement of a
preposition (dative, possessive, locative), b) compound final (in a few tight
compound constructions like that with erk 'bad', §5.2.4.4); and c) subject
immediately following an inflected verb. In all three cases, the noun in
question can be said to ""depend on"" an immediately preceding word or stem.
    If a noun that has a vocalic prefix consisting of a full V (i.e. a noun
beginning with Sg α-, e-, t-α-, t-e-, or PI i- or t-i-) occurs in dependent state,
directly following the preposition, compound initial, or verb on which it
""depends,"" the prefix undergoes Prefix Reduction. There is no other
morphological indication of dependent state (for example, there is no case-
marking of subject or prepositional complement), so Prefix-Reduction itself is
as close as we come in this language to structural case-marking. Note that
nouns that do not have a full-V prefix undergo no (audible) reduction of the
prefix.
     I use the diacritic 1 before a noun to indicate that it has undergone audible
Prefix Reduction. I do not use the diacritic for other nouns (e.g. those lacking a
full-V vocalic prefix), even when they occur in syntactic positions associated
with dependent state.
    The relevant shifts are given in (125).",[166]

12.1    RelativizationThere are two cross-cutting axes of differentiation within relative clauses. The
first is that between definite and indefinite relative clause. This is a
fundamental distinction and has an effect on the form of the verb inside the
relative clause. The second distinction is between subject, object, and
prepositional relative, based on the syntactic role of the NP in the embedded
clause that is coindexed with the head. Subject relatives are expressed with
participles. Non-subject relatives are expressed with ordinary verbs, subject to
certain modifications in ablaut features and accent.
     It is customary in cross-linguistic syntactic theory to speak of a head noun
(or NP), e.g. 'dog' in 'the dog that I saw'. In Tamashek relatives, it is more
useful to speak of the clause-internal head within the relative clause itself. In
a definite relative clause, this internal head is a demonstrative, with definite
reference, that is prosodically part of the relative clause rather than part of a
NP with the preceding noun. The demonstrative is appositional to the head
NP (if the latter is overt). In definite relative clauses, the u n m a r k e d
demonstrative is the Proximate with stem -ά.
     In the case of an indefinite relative clause, the internal head is the head
noun itself, or (in the absence of a head noun) an indefinite demonstrative
with stem -Ί. In indefinite relatives there is no apposition since the head is
represented only in its relative-clause-internal manifestation.
     Any clitics present within a relative clause proper are hosted by the
internal head. In other words, in indefinite relatives the clitics attach to the
head noun (or indefinite demonstrative if there is no head noun), while in
definite relatives the clitics attach to the definite demonstrative. This justifies
the view that this head is internal to the relative clause (whereas a head noun in
a definite relative is external to the relative clause).
     The two constructions are therefore those in (708). The ordering of clitics
and preverbs will be discussed in more detail in later sections.","[640, 641, 642]"
"(713)    Definite Subject Relative Clause           [demonstrative (clitics) (preverb) definite Partpl ...(complements)]     I consider the demonstrative to be in apposition to the head NP, and to be
the initial constituent of the relative clause itself. The head noun may appear
before the relative clause, or may be be omitted, resulting in a headless
construction translatable as e.g. 'he who drank the tea' or 'the one who drank
the tea'.
     The demonstrative forms (MaSg w-ά etc. after noun, 3rd person pronoun,
or zero, and 1 after lst/2nd person pronoun) are given in the opening of §12.1,
above.
     The morphology of participles is described at length in §8.5. Participles
distinguish MaSg, FeSg, and (gender-unspecified) PI of the subject. If there is
a preverbal particle (Negative or Future), the participial suffix is (in most
cases) attached to the preverb. (714.a) is a simple transitive relative clause;
(714.b) illustrates the position of object clitics, and (714.c-d) illustrates the
attachment of the participial ending to a preverbal particle. (714.e) shows the
ablaut modifications (here χ-pci Erasure (130) and Rightward Accent Shift
(132)) that are normal in definite relatives, cf. 0 - t - l h n s f f i - t (c/t-t-ihnsffi-t/)

              'the woman who is groaning' [K-d]    Indefinite relatives are similar in structure except that a head noun is
obligatory and the demonstrative is absent. The participle is therefore attached
directly to the head noun. The participle has different forms in definite and
indefinite constructions, since some reductions of ablaut-induced V-length
(Resit, LoImpfP) and the shift or erasure of the ablaut accent, characteristic of
definite participles, do not apply to indefinite relative (whose verbs or
participles are based on the same stem shapes as verbs in main clauses).
    The majority of examples of the indefinite construction in texts involve
intransitive verbs with adjectival meaning. Such stems have indefinite
participial forms with high text frequency, often based on a Resit stem and
translatable as modifying adjectives in English; see §8.5.7. In the text (Chapter
16), (920) uses an indefinite relative like an English parenthetical
(nonrestrictive) relative. A transitive example with object clitic following the
head noun is (715).

1.6 Fieldwork and other dataI have worked in northern Mali since 1986, including annual visits since 1989.
In 1986 and 1989 I worked chiefly on Hassaniya Arabic. From 1990 to 1998 I
concentrated on Songhay languages, and am still finishing up this work. From
1999 to 2003, however, I focused on Tamashek. I am simultaneously
completing a Tamashek-English-French dictionary which I expect to be
published by Karthala, Paris. I have put great emphasis on lexicography in this
project, and I have drawn heavily on lexical data in this grammar. I am
considering the best way to make my textual data available, perhaps in an
electronic format, in the next few years.
    In the field, the first order of business was compiling a decent working
lexicon. I undertook systematic lexical elicitation, primarily in Timbuktu in
summer 1999 and autumn 2000, with emphasis on ecological vocabulary
(natural species and related terminology). With a lexicon of about 2500 items I
then undertook analysis of dialogue tapes that I had recorded over the years in
Timbuktu (T-ka and others), Gao (speakers from the Kidal areas), and
Hombori (speakers living in the Gourma, most of whom were ultimately of
Timbuktu or Goundam origin). I also made some recordings of Tamajak (and
Tadaksahak) speakers in Menaka. I commissioned preliminary transcriptions
and French translations of several of the tapes from government applied
linguists in Bamako, namely Rhali Ag Mohamed of DNAFLA (native of
Kidal) and Mahmoud Ag Oyett of IPN (native of Menaka). I later took these
10   I Introductiontranscriptions and the tapes back into the field and prepared corrected versions
of the transcriptions.
     An outline of the grammar, focusing on the T-ka dialect, was developed
into a more comprehensive draft with a native speaker present in Bamako in
summer 2001. Modifications and additions were made thereafter based on
closer analysis of texts, and follow-up elicitation in summer 2002. In that trip I
also went over the Timbuktu-biased dictionary draft with a native of Ansongo-
Gourma for several weeks. In summer 2003,1 went through the by now rather
large dictionary draft with a native of Kidal (Kal Unan tribe) then in Gao. Of
course some grammatical material was also gathered from the Ansongo-
Gourma and Kal Unan speakers. I was able to work for about a week with a
speaker from the Gourma Rharous area, and few a few days each with
speakers from Kidal (Ifoghas), Immenas, and Tessalitt. In 2003, Mahmoud Ag
Oyett and I organized a three-day workshop for Tamashek applied linguists
and teachers in Gao, and I was able to glean some interesting dialectal details
from the participants.
     The most urgent remaining task for the analysis of Tamashek is a fuller
study of phrase- and clause-level prosody based on recorded texts.","[28, 29]"

combines /iae/ as /a/ (39.a), and Lexical Accent Erasure (139) is triggered by
the loss of a V, giving / i - m - a e s l - a n / , which then undergoes Default
Accentuation to yield i-m-assl-αη with surface antepenultimate accent. By
contrast, in (68.b), Default Accentuation must apply first, giving /i-lseda-asn/,
followed by VV-Contraction (39.a), producing i-laed-αη. In the latter, my
convention is to write an acute accent, but the accent is neither lexical
(compare Sg ά-laeda) nor ablaut-induced, so it can only come from Default
Accentuation at an early stage in the derivation.
    Clearly the interaction between Stem-Final i/A-deletion (29), VV-
Contraction, and Default Accentuation is complicated. It is possible to account
for the data using phonological derivations as sketched here. However, the
                                                                3.3 Accent    93derivations involves intricate rule sequencing, with the relative order of
Default Accentuation and VV-Contraction depending on morphological type.
    Additional interactions of accent with morphology, or more accurately
with morphosyntax, are described in §3.5.3. There we see that ablaut-induced
accent can be shifted (one syllable to the right) or deleted entirely in a
syntactically defined context, namely in definite relative clauses.","[111, 112]"

balular include dakukam 'walk softly', daruram '(liquid) run', farurad 'eat
voraciously', garuras 'sing', r a l u r a l '(liquid) gurgle', h a r u h a r 'migrate', and
karukar 'rotate'. Counterparts with i instead of u are considerably less
common, but parallel to karikaw I can cite namirak 'be in order' and waliwal
'be in motion'. The verb 'need' can go either way, both mavutar and maritar
being attested.
    Since one set has medial u while the other has medial i in the
imperfectives and VblN, it seems clear that this V is lexical. It shows up
overtly in stems with <H> melody. The α in the perfectives is therefore due to
superimposition of a <L> melody, or (in my preferred analysis) the L
component of an underlying <H L> perfective melody whose Η component is
squelched by Stem-Initial Syncope and Leftward L-Spreading (§3.2.7). In
372     7 Verbal morphologycontrast to some other verb shapes to be discussed below, with -CvCuCvC-
stems the medial high V is stripped of its lexical vowel-quality features under
perfective ablaut and becomes a pure a.
    Perfectives and the inflectable Shlmpf show Stem-Initial V-Insertion, and
the stem-initial CvCu... makes these stems eligible for Stem-Initial Syncope.
Long imperfective ablaut audibly expresses all local ablaut formatives,
including both length formatives χ-pcl and χ-f. Since there is a lexical high V,
the long (as well as short) imperfective has <H> melody. The verbs with
medial lexical u are also eligible for u-Spreading (§3.4.9.3), hence the double
u in LoImpfP -t-iblulur- in (373). Medial V-Shortening, which often co-
occurs with u-Spreading, fails to apply since the medial u is not followed by a
CC cluster. In A-grm dialect, u-Spreading does not exist, hence -t-lblulir-.
    Having dealt with the superheavy verbs, I now turn to middleweight
verbs. I begin with those that have a medial CC cluster, i.e. -CuCCvC-. I
know of no such verb with medial i, but there are a number with medial u, like
-hussvl- in (374).","[390, 391]"
"    There is normally only one focalized constituent. However, as in other
local languages, it is possible to embed a focalized clause in a 'why?'
interrogative. This is arguably a layered double-focus construction, but the
only Focus morpheme is associated with the internal focus (746).(746)    ma-\fael      [i-s-αη           [a          i-rhd]]

         'Why (is it) meat [focus] that he likes?' [Gao]    The ά Focus morpheme is regularly omitted in WH-interrogatives (§12.3).
In my T-ka data, with this exception the morpheme is normally audible in
focalized constructions. In my Kidal-area data, omission is fairly common in
texts even in non-interrogative focalizations, though informants are always
willing to repeat the examples more carefully with the ά audibly present, so I
am inclined to interpret omission as due to a low-level contraction. My K-d
informant, in elicitation, allowed omission in subject but not other
focalizations. However, in my Κ texts (from other speakers), I did observe
omission of ά in object focalization as well as subject focalization.",[662]

produced from -PuCCu- by application of <H L> melody, plus Stem-Initial
V-Insertion, and Ci-Gemination (§3.5.8). As usual with perfectives that have
a stem-initial short V followed by a syllable containing a full high V, dialects
other than T-ka and A-grm have initial ae instead of a, thus -sejjujja- and
-aejjussa- in those other dialects.
     The two verbs in (394) diverge in the melodies used in the short and long
imperfectives. 'Load' has an imperfective <L> melody while 'go south' has
<H>. In the short imperfective, the hi at the end of /-aejjajji-/ is deleted stem-
finally (without subject suffix), appears as a before C-initial subject suffix, and
contracts with /ae/ at the beginning of V-initial subject suffixes to produce a.
Sample inflected Shlmpf forms are 3MaSg ad 0-aejjajj 'he will load', 2Sg ad
t-aejjajja-d, and 3FePl aejjajja-naet. In the long imperfectives, both verbs show

Medial V-Shortening. The 'go south' type is more consistent with the vocalism
of-CuCCvC- verbs like -hussvl- 'be obligatory' (§7.3.1.7).
     The other verb of the 'load' type (394) is -bubbu- 'carry (baby) on back'
(PerfP -abbubba-, Imprt babb, LoImpfP -t-abaebba-, VblN a-babb or bsebba
(also α-bübb for K-d). The verbs 'sit' and 'testify' in §7.3.2.9-10 have some
idiosyncracies but have similar MAN stem paradigms.
     The other verbs of the 'go south' type (394) are -fuggu- 'be detached' (e.g.
LoImpfP -t-lfaggu-, VblN α-fugg) and - j u r h u - 'end up' (e.g. LoImpfP
-t-rjarhu-, VblN a-jurh).
     'Load' and 'be detached' have reported cognates in Niger Tamajak, where
they appear to have the same conjugation (LTF2: 59, 83, 441), including VblN
""aCCaCCi,"" Shlmpf ""äCCäCCu,"" and LoImpfP ""-taCäCCu."" For Algeria,
DTF 1.406 has forms for 'load' including 3MaSg PerfP ""iego'ugga"" and Imprt
""gagg"", and similar forms are given for 'carry (baby) on back' DTF 1.16,
while 'be detached' has Imprt ""fouggou"" DTS 1.308, so Algeria at least has a
split like that in Malian Tamashek. 'Load' has a counterpart in Songhay
(jeeje), and 'carry (baby) on back' is a widespread West African word found in
most Malian languages; I am not sure which language is the original source of
either item.
     A verb meaning 'be sterile' has a related paradigm, but my T-ka data
show a mix of non-augment and augmented forms: PerfP -ajjujra- or
augmented -ajjujrae-t, Imprt jüjra-t, LoImpfP -t-ijajru- or augmented
-t-Tjajru-t, abstractive nominal ajjajru. The imperfective vocalism links this
verb with 'go south' in (394). The instability is due to the fact that jr is an
unstable word-final cluster, in that the r is more sonorous than the j. This
would be a particular problem in the Imprt, where non-augment /jujri/ should
appear as #jujr after Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (29) (§3.1.2.4). This would
require resyllabification by Final-CC Schwa-Insertion and (in T-ka)
Epenthetic-V Accentuation to #jujar. Adding Augment -t makes it possible to
avoid this resyllabification.
     The A-grm speaker gave a different paradigm for 'be sterile', not involving
Stem-Final i/A-Deletion: PerfP -aggagra-, Imprt gsegru, and LoImpfP
-t-agaegra-. For K-d I elicited PerfP -sejjujrae-t but could not elicit
imperfectives (the verb denotes a stative quality and therefore appears most
often in the Resit, in the perfective system). The R informant did not recognize
the word.
     I now turn to verbs that have a basic middleweight shape -CoCu- with
ungeminated medial C. These verbs cannot undergo Medial V-Shortening,
which requires a CC cluster after the medial full V. Most of the verbs also fail
to apply Q-Gemination in the wake of Stem-Initial V-Insertion (perfective
system, Shlmpf). The most striking feature of these verbs, however, is a mid-
height V {o e) in the perfectives. The avoidance of C,-Gemination and the
perfective mid-height V link these verbs to -CuCvC- verbs.
398     7 Verbal morphology    I begin with those that have Ο in the perfective, and basic form - C u C d -

"     As (424.c) shows, the subject can be 1st or 2nd person, generally in the
sense 'be (here), be present'. Further examples are slle-q-\q Ί am here',
n-all-\e 'we are here', and t-alld-mAt 'you-MaPl are present'.
     For the primary K-d, T-ka, and R informants, omission of the 3MaSgO
clitic occurred after 2FePl -maet and 3FePl -naet (in positive sentences), hence
t-alld-maet 'you-FePl are here' and alla-nast 'they-FePl exist, are here', instead
of #t-alla-ma£t-\t, etc. Contrast 3MaPl all0-n-\t in these dialects, with clearly
audible 3MaSgO clitic -\t. There is no phonological reason preventing the
                                       7.3 Verb classes and irregular verbs    423object clitic from occurring after -mast or -nast, in the postconsonantal form -\t,
since geminated tt is audible word-finally after a V (as in FeSg suffix complex
-t-t after V-final noun stem). The absence of -\t after -maet or -naet is therefore
a morphophonological rule, deleting the (semantically meaningless) clitic after
a subject suffix ending in t.
     For the R speaker, who was also checked carefully, the status of the object
clitic is quite different. For this speaker, -alle seems to have been reanalysed
as a simple perfective stem variant (used in the absence of a subject suffix).
As a consequence, 3MaSg clitic -\t is also absent from the paradigm, except
that it may be added optionally to the pronominally suffixed forms, denoting
the specific location. Some examples are in (425).","[441, 442]"

               definite demonstrative     participle         ablaut change    In (8.a), a morphophonological rule Prefix Reduction (e.g. -a- reduced to
-as-, or -i- reduced to -a-) applies to nouns in combinations with specific
preceding forms. Of special interest is the fact that reduction applies to the
12    2 Overviewverb-subject sequence, but not to a verb-object sequence. For more on the
role this plays in ""case marking,"" see §2.3, below.
    For verbs, the only true local dependency is that of an inflected verb on a
preceding Negative (8.b). This applies in all combinations where no elements
(other than floating clitics) intervene between the two, hence to perfective,
(long) imperfective, and imperative (i.e. prohibitive) stems. Basically the
modification converting Y to Y' adds phonetic content (where it is not
vacuous) in the perfective, reduces phonetic content (erasing a V-length ablaut
formative χ-pcl and an accent ablaut formative χ-pcl) in the imperfective and
prohibitive, and modifies the stem vocalism in all of these stems.
    The cases in (8.c) are limited to definite relative clauses, which begin
with a definite demonstrative (in apposition to the head NP, which if overtly
expressed is external to the clause). The modification in ablaut form of the
verb involves erasure of a V-length ablaut formative (χ-pcl), and (with
specific exceptions) a shift in the location of the ablaut accent formative (in
one combination, this formative is entirely erased). The formulation of the
relevant rules requires an extraordinary interpenetration of ""syntax"" and
""phonology,"" and constitutes an important empirical argument against highly
modularized theories of grammar.
    It is possible to combine two [X Y'...] configurations, as in the
combination [Negative verb noun(subject) ...]. In this combination, the
relevant pairs involving local dependencies are [Negative verb] and [verb
noun(subject)]. As a result, internal bracketing as in [Negative [verb
noun(subject)] ...] or [[Negative verb] noun(subject) ...] is counterproductive
(any such bracketing would appear to separate two forms that enter into a local
dependency). The only points that matter are adjacency (disregarding clitics)
and the grammatical relationship (e.g. Negative + verb, or verb +
noun(subject).
    Superficially similar cases are those in (9)(9)     [X Y'...] Dependencies Not Requiring Adjacency        X                     Y'          modification in Y'        Future particle       verb        Short Imperfective
        complementizer        verb        Short Imperfective    The cases in (9) involve either a Future particle or a particular type of
complementizer, plus an inflected ""Short Imperfective"" form. The latter cannot
be used clause-initially with its usual subject pronominal inflections. However,
the short imperfective is related to the positive imperative (which has no
morphological connection to the prohibitive). The positive imperative is
clause-initial (hence is preceded by no ""X"" element), and it lacks the usual
subject pronominals.
                                                                   2.2 Nouns      13     Importantly, while the [X Y' ...] depencies in (8) require direct adjacency
(except that they allow floating clitics to be hosted by X), the dependency of
the Short Imperfective on the Future particle or on the complementizer in (9)
can extend to a second short imperfective clause appended to the first one,
with no repetition of the X element. Thus [Future Shlmpf,, Shlmpf 2 ] is
grammatical, where both verbs are under the scope of the Future morpheme
(cf. English he will come, and eat). No confusion is likely, since the Shlmpf
cannot be used in the absence of a dependency. In other words, a Shlmpf can
be triggered by a variable-distance dependency; compare the concept of
""serie enchainee"" adapted from other Berberist literature to Tuareg by Leguil
(1992:43). By contrast, we cannot get e.g. #[Neg Verb,, Verty where both
verbs are under the scope of the negator; the correct expression is [Neg Verb,,
Neg Verb2] with the negator repeated, since adjacency is required in local
dependencies.","[30, 31, 32]"

             3FePl         -\enast                     -\taenast     We can see that the ""elsewhere"" column has the fullest forms, beginning
with a k (2nd person) or t (third person) that is deleted in most post-α variants.
The full forms are quite similar to the corresponding independent pronouns,
e.g. 2MaSg kseyy. The 3FeSg form -\taet might be analysed as consisting of
3rd person -t- and FeSg -aet (the latter also appears as the end of the 2FePl and
3FePl clitics).
     The 3FeSg, 3MaPl, and 3FePl allomorphs that follow stem-final α are best
taken as underlyingly V-initial, e.g. 3MaPl Men/. One could even argue that
the underlying initial V is /as/ rather than /e/, since the sequence /a + as/ is
realized as e in some verb-suffix combinations by VV-Contraction (§3.2.3.3).
The clitic vowel is counted, as is the preceding V, in Default Accentuation.
Example: Ί-rrsbba 'he raised (a child)', but i-rrabbe-\n 'he raised them-Ma',
whose surface penultimate accent is regular if Default Accentuation applies to
/i-3rr3bba-\en/. By contrast, in l-qri-\kmaet 'he killed you-Fe' the clitic does
not seem to begin in a V, though it forces the preceding /aJ to shift to i.
     A few more examples follow. With the clitic on a preverbal particle:
a-\kaey i-wat 'he will hit you-MaSg' (Future ad reduces to a - before clitics).
After a verb ending in a, such a s l - q r a 'he killed' (PerfP), we getl-qriAm 'he
killed you-FeSg', andl-qre-\n 'he killed them-Ma'. With a stem-final C, we
have examples like l-nhaeyAtasn 'he saw them-MaPl' (PerfP). With stem-final
u, my data consistently show the longer forms from the right-hand column of
(668), as in i-t-irdu-\kaimaet 'he believes you-FePl' (LoImpfP). When the
stem-final is i, I recorded both contracted and long forms: i-s-imtalli-\kasy =
i-s-untalliAk 'he confuses you-MaSg' (LoImpfP). In i-s-lmt9lli-\k and other
forms, note the default word accent (i.e. on the antepenult); while the stem-
final i arguably represents a contraction, it does not count as two syllables for
purposes of Default Accentuation.
     The 3MaSg form is somewhat more complex (669).

                          phrase-final after single C;
                          after Future a- or Focus a before C-initial verb;
                          after clitic-final single C (e.g. cliticized preposition)
            Aatt          after preverbal C-final focalized word, before V
            Aat           after preverbal C-final focalized word, before C     The major cut here is between -\e and the consonantal forms. The latter
have a basic form /-\tt/ (see below for a possible extra V). Schwa-Epenthesis
accounts for the variants with a. After Schwa-Epenthesis, the geminate is
simplified to t if adjacent to a C on either side.
     The consonantal allomorphs behave as though they had a vowel (see
below for dialectal Ati), for purposes of Default Accentuation. Thus
anhaey-asqAq Ί saw him', accented on the word penult, as though from
/anhaey-aer-tV/. For T-ka, however, the lost V does not appear overtly in any
context. If necessary, Schwa-Epenthesis can insert schwa before the IM when
the latter is sandwiched between other C's, as in ... sAat t-aqqaen-aed '...by
which you built it'.
     The e of the first column is, one presumes, in some sense the ""same"" e as
that resulting from contraction of stem-final α with the /ae/ of the other 3rd
person object clitics. Taking this (and the preceding observation about accent)
to a logical conclusion, one could posit a representation /tae/ for the 3MaSg
object clitic. When the initial t of 3rd person object clitics is deleted after an
α-final verb, the remaining /ae/ contracts with the stem-final /a/ in the same
way seen above. However, as a practical matter I will hyphenate the 3MaSg
object combinations as ...Ae.
    Examples of Ae are PerfP t - s q r A e 'she killed him' (<t-3qra), LoImpfP
i-salhAe 'he made him weep' (c-sdlha-), LoImpfP i-tottAe 'he eats it' (<-tatt-
for/-tdttA-/), Imprt s-smm-aswAe 'give him another drink!' (<s-3mm-3saw
for/s-amm-aswi/), Imprt a r A e 'open-Sg it!' (<ar for /ari/). Examples of
variants containing t are 0-ojaeyAt 'he tied him', a-\tt awat-naet 'they-FePl
will hit him', i-firruAtt 'he inherits it'.
    Initial /t/ or Dd in a clitic is subject to assimilation to a preceding stop (or
r , which hardens to a stop). The conversions are shown in (670). The
assimilations affecting /t/ in 3rd person clitics are identical to those affecting

"
12.2     FocalizationFocalization involves highlighting (or interrogating) the choice of one element
in a clause, the remainder being backgrounded (presupposed or at least not in
play). Syntactic focalization in Tamashek is limited to NPs (including
adverbials and VblN's).
    The focalized constituent is fronted to sentence-initial position. It is
normally followed by the morpheme a , interpretable as a minimal
demonstrative form but here labeled ""Foc[us]."" Any clitics that may be
present are hosted by the Foe morpheme, or if the latter is absent they are
hosted by the focalized NP. The remainder of the clause follows. The ablaut
reductions of Resit and LoImpfP verbs seen in definite relative clauses do not
apply to focalization, in spite of a certain syntactic similarity between the two.
Therefore, if the verb is Resit or LoImpfP, it occurs with its full ablaut
structure and normal accentuation, as in simple main clauses.
    The pragmatics of focalization are illustrated in (743). The first clause
(negative) is unfocalized. The second clause, which specifies the real object of
desire, is focalized.(743)   war      1-rha                     t-afva-t-t,

end up on the clitic, as in a-\tset 0-aeks 'he will eat it-FeSg', cf. (73.c) above.
    Suppose now that an accentual phrase has two or more syllables to the left
of the rightmost accent (whether the latter is lexical or default). If the phrase is
uttered smoothly, there is often a pattern of secondary accent on alternate
syllables counting back from this rightmost accent.
    This applies even to over-long single words, such as t-ifarsassin-asn 'they
(=hides) are coarse' or l-t-ifarsassin 'it is coarse', where Default Accentuation
gives primary phonetic accent to the antepenult. A slight secondary accent may
be heard on the word-initial syllable, which is two syllables from the rightmost
accent. Secondary accents are not as reliable as rightmost accents, particularly
since they require the speaker to compute the accent of the entire long word
from right to left before beginning its articulation. In a case like 'it is coarse',
in actual discourse the speaker may begin the word as i-t-1..., since the second i
actually carries an underlying ablaut accent; in this event we may end up with
                                                                3.3 Accent     97[iti'fae'rjajiin] with adjacent-syllable accents. The ""regular"" pattern of
secondary accents is therefore most easily found in elicitation, especially when
the informant repeats an utterance.
     In multi-word accentual phrases, the same basic pattern arises. In
particular, accented clitics like Centripetal -\idd or Centrifugal -\hin, and
accented pre-verbal particles like Past kaeld may have their lexical accent
overridden by the alternating accent rule. An example is (74), whose
underlying form is /a-\hin itaw-aev/. Default accent appears on the i, resulting
in the erasure of the lexical accent on the Centrifugal clitic and the appearance
of a secondary accent on the Future preverb. The same caveat about on-line
production variation made above for single-word forms is even more pertinent
here; the smooth rhythms of (74) are most often heard in repetitions.(74)    a-\hin            Itaw-aer

"    Other constituents (e.g. adverbials, including PPs with nominal
complement) come at the end of the clause, though as noted above pronominal
PPs are usually cliticized.(15)    a.       i-la-\faell-l                        aslhaeqq

18     2 Overview    Regardless of whether a subject NP is present, the pronominal category of
the subject is expressed on the verb. Thus ajjass-asn 'they-Ma entered', or with
explicit subject NP sjjaes-gen medd-aen 'men entered'.
    A noun in subject function following its verb, or a noun functioning as
complement of a preposition, undergoes Prefix Reduction (§2.3, above). This
does not apply to an object noun, even when it immediately follows the verb.
Prefix Reduction in an immediately post-verbal noun is therefore diagnostic of
subject as opposed to object status, for those nouns whose pronunciation is
audibly affected by Prefix Reduction (i.e. those with vocalic prefix allomorph
a- or e-). Nouns whose vocalic prefix is already short, or that lack a vocalic
prefix, show no subject/object variation in form.","[36, 37]"

3.1.2.4   Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (in verbs)A number of verbs have stem-alternations involving full V's, short V's, and
zero. These are the only unaugmented V-final verbs. For example, 'vomit' has
a PerfP -absa-, with 3FePl subject absas-naet 'they-Fe vomited'; I take its basic
lexical form to be -vbsu-. The Shlmpf is -zebs (e.g. Sg Imprt aebs 'vomit!')
without the final V. The Shlmpf combines with 3FePl subject suffix -naet as
absa-naet, with a stem-final a that also induces an assimilatory (i.e. harmonic)
change of stem-initial /ae/ to a. It also combines with 3MaPl subject suffix -aen
to give sbsa-n. I take the basic (lexical) form of the Shlmpf to be /-aebsi-/,
ending in an underspecified high V ""i"" that is deleted without trace word-
finally (i.e. where no subject suffix appears). The hi contracts with the /ae/ of a
38   3 Phonologyfollowing V-initial subject suffix to form 3, in effect transferring its [+high]
feature to the surviving short V. The hi surfaces as a before C-initial subject
suffixes like 3FeSg -naet.
      A good case can be made for a parallel underspecified and deletable low V
that I write IAI. This occurs only in long imperfectives of a subset (namely,
bisyllablic -vCCu-) of the same V-final verbs that have h i in the short
imperfective (preceding paragraph). The LoImpfP in question appears as
- P d Q Q word-finally (i.e., with no subject suffix), as in -bass 'vomit'.
However, when a C-initial subject suffix is added, we get forms like 3FePl
bassas-nast with a stem-final low V, and this is the main evidence for a
representation of the type /-bdssA-/. When a subject suffix beginning in as is
added, we get forms like 3MaPl bdssae-n, which could be generated with or
without a stem-final /A/, but which I take (by parallelism to the short
imperfectives) as due to contraction, i.e. /bassA-asn/ with the IAI transferring
its [-high] feature to the surviving contracted V. In sum, the evidence for IAI is
weaker than that for hi, and IAI occurs in the paradigms of a subset of the
stems that have hi.
      For more on these unaugmented V-final verbs see §7.3.1.3.
      Both final hi and IAI in these verbs correspond to ""u"" in the corresponding
forms of Niger Tamajak (LTF2 424, class I.A.7-ll,e.g. Imprt ""zeknu"" and
LoImpfP ""ikannu"" for 'do well'). However, Foucauld's data do not have a
final V in such forms as ""iläss"" for 'he dresses' (DTF 4.2020) and ""ed iken""
for 'he will do well' (DTF 2.821).
      Synchronically in Tamashek, one might equate stem-final hi with a, and
IAI with ae, noting that {a ae} do not otherwise occur as stem-final segments.
However, these equations are not transparent, and the fact that the verbs in
question have stem-final full V's in the perfective and long imperfective stems
makes it difficult to justify short-vowel representations for hi and IAI. No
other stems or words in the language end with short V's.
      If we were to identify hi and IAJ with full V's (the only V's that otherwise
occur in stem-final position), hi should probably be identified with i rather
than with u. This is because there are some verb classes with a non-deleting
final u, either in the imperfective forms only or in both perfective and
imperfective stems. For example, the verb 'cough' appears as -asu- in both
PerfP and Shlmpf stems (§7.3.1.4). This u does not delete word-finally, and
contracts with /ae/ at the beginning of a subject suffix to form u rather than a,
as in asu-n 'they-Ma coughed' from /asu-aen/. This true stem-final u therefore
has no phonological similarity to III. However, there is only one verb with true
i in the Shlmprt stem, namely -Iwi- 'be born'. Since this verb has a /-iCi-/
shape not found with any of the verbs that I analyse as having final hi in the
Shlmpf (and IAI in the LoImpfP), one could imagine identifying III with i and
trying to connect the phonological differences in some way with stem shape.
However, again this is a somewhat convoluted argument, and I prefer to think
of hi and IAJ as abstract segments with vowel-like properties.
      The deletion rule may be formulated as (29).
                                                             3.1 Segments     39(29)      Stem-Final i/A-Deletion (Verbs)              Stem-final underspecified vowels I I I (high) and /A/ (low) are
              deleted when not followed by a nonzero subject suffix    The nonzero suffixes expressing imperative subject (MaPl -aet, FePl -maet)
do not count as ""subject suffixes"" for this purpose and do not block the
deletion (§7.2.3.2).
    When deletion of hi produces a word-final CC cluster, depending on
which C's are involved it may be necessary to resyllabify by inserting a schwa
between the two. In T-ka this also entails an accent shift onto the schwa. See
§3.2.4 and §3.3.2 for details.","[56, 57, 58]"
"     However, in this example, '...(that) we know it' is not a true relative
clause, since (unlike the case with normal object relatives) the object is
represented as a 3MaSgO clitic on the verb.
     As in other languages, constructions involving two relative clauses may
either be stacked with the second relative modifying an NP inside the first
relative ('the cat that ate the rat that lived...'), or parallel, both modifying the
same head noun ('the man whom you saw who works in town'). Consider

3.1.1.3   Uvulars (r q)q is common as a phonetic entity but has marginal phonemic status. Most cases
of phonetic [q] are in the geminated form qq, word-medially or -finally, and
these can be interpreted as the phonetic realization of geminated / r r / , The
conversion of /YY/ to q q is productive, and applies not only word-internally
but also over word boundaries (§3.2.1.1).
     Within words, we have cases of morphological gemination such as
/i-avmbb-aet/ >l-qqubb-aet 'he gulped', cf. verbal noun a - r a b b u 'gulping'.
At a nonprefixal morpheme boundary (with a suffix or clitic), q q often
represents Μ or IrkJ, as when a morpheme otherwise ending in γ is followed
by a morpheme otherwise consisting of or beginning in t or k (e.g. FeSg -t,
3MaPl object clitic -t, or any of the pronominal clitics beginning in k). An
example is the name of the language, / t - a 2 - m d : s a e v - t / > t-£e-ma:saeq-q
'Tamashek'; see §3.2.1.1 for more detail. In these cases, the effect is a
bidirectional feature assimilation whereby the t or k adopts the uvular position
of the Y while the latter adopts a voiceless stop articulation.
     At word boundaries, we have such examples as preposition dser 'in' plus
any noun beginning in Y, e.g. DA2Y Yussast 'in August', often pronounced
[dajqiu'J'iaet]. Another recurring combination is a verb ending in lSgS -3ΪΥ
followed by particle Yds 'only'.
     While /YY/ is regularly realized as qq, there are hints that ungeminated q
may be on the way to becoming a phoneme distinct from Y. This is because q
as well as γ can occur in ungeminated position. While γ is much more
common, there are some cases of q in Arabic borrowings, as in PerfP -aqbael-
'consent' (imperative aqbal, LoImpfP -qdbbael-, cf. noun aelqabdla, all from
Arabic qbl 'accept'). Contrast this with a native stem like -SYbaer- 'kick with
heel' (Imprt 3Ybsr, LoImpfP -Yabbaer-). There are also dialectally sporadic
cases of ungeminated q in non-borrowed vocabulary, especially where back-
26    3    Phonologyformation from geminated qq may be involved. An example of internal back-
formation is the verb 'sit' (§7.3.2.9), which often appears in the perfective or
resultative stem, which involve gemination to q q (PerfP - a j q q i m a - , etc.). For
some speakers we also (by back-formation) get ungeminated q rather than γ in
forms like Imprt q a y a m (variant q a m ) alongside r a y m , where I interpret the
variants with q as influenced by the qq of the perfectives.
    In the combination η γ , often representing alveolar η plus Y, the γ
approaches the stop articulation [q], or an affricated articulation that sounds
like phonetic [q Y ]. The most common case is the verb 'kill', P e r f P -aqYa-
[-sqq^a-], but e.g. VblN t-e-naeYe with intervening vowel. I do not use "" q ""
here in phonemic transcriptions, since I am not convinced that the segment in
question is completely voiceless in this position; an instrumental phonetic
study would be useful. N o similar affrication occurs in m r , e.g. i - n w a d
'vassals' (PI of a-m3Yid).
    While there is incipient phonemic splitting of q and Y, the alternation of
ungeminated γ and geminated q q remains quite fundamental. For purposes of
alphabetizing dictionary entries, I treat q as though γ (i.e. immediately
following g).","[44, 45]"

                  'lily-trotter, jacana' (bird that can walk on water lily leaves)    The verb in these examples can be identified as short imperfective, but
there is some ambiguity as to whether it is the inflectable Shlmpf or bare (in
the latter case it would be identical to the Sg Imprt). In (265.a-d) there is no
subject affix, and the compound is treated as MaSg for purposes of agreement,
but since the stem is C-initial we cannot exclude the possibility that an original
3FeSg prefix t- has been lost. In (265.e), there is clearly no subject affix,
making an identification as Sg Imprt possible. In (265.f-h), on the other hand,
there is an audible 3FeSg prefix, and the compound as a whole is treated as
feminine in agreement. Perhaps in (265.e) the unprefixed ""imperative""
functions as the masculine counterpart of such feminines.
    The verb in (265.b) can mean 'look up' or 'go north, go away from river',
and cognates in some non-Malian Tuareg varieties mean 'go up'. Perhaps 'look
up (at sun)' is pertinent to this compound.
    While the transcriptions in (265) shows word boundaries between verb and
noun, these compounds can function as simple stems. For example,
'woodpecker' (265.c) can be pluralized as kaewkaew-i-rbab-tasn with MaPl
suffix -taen. Note that i - r b a b 'tree holes' is already plural (by ablaut), so -taen
can only be taken as suffixed to the entire stem: [kaewkaew WbabJ-tasn.
    As an example of the mutations that can occur with semi-transparent
compounds, consider the three variants in (266), all of which denote the same
bird (scrub-robin or similar species), t-a-rsat-t means 'bit of excrement, animal
dropping(s)'.(266)        a.     aggad              t-a-rsat-t

                     son.of[?]         Fe-Sg-dropping-FeSg    The first variant appears to contain (Imprt) aggad 'jump'. The second is
more difficult to segment, but aegu could be taken as a dialectal variant of
Imprt £ej 'make'. In the third, the onset resembles aegg 'son o f , but in such a
compound one would expect Prefix Reduction in the following noun. Both
segu and aeggu could further be taken as containing ü 'owner o f , in which case
                                       5.2 Possession and compounding       271(266.c) could be parsed as 'son of owner of excrement (pellets)'. Plurals are
difficult to elicit, but I did obtain aeggu-t-a-rsad-en for the third one.
     In (267), the verb is PerfP zajrat- rather than Shlmpf -zaejrset-.(267)   zajrat              basnnan
        be.long.PerfP       without.reason
        'middle finger' (takes FeSg agreement)    zajrat 'be long, tall' is an adjectival C-initial verb, hence its perfective
cannot take subject pronominal prefixes. Therefore 3MaSg and 3FeSg forms
are identical.
    In (268) we have a negated PerfN verb. The phrase is literally 'it was not
(= has not been) cut' (compare the English flower term forget-me-not). The

                                Prepositions
True prepositions have the following features: a) they combine with a
following NP, which undergoes Prefix Reduction; b) they combine with
pronominal suffixes into fused forms (pronominal PPs); c) when the NP
complement of the preposition is relativized on or focalized, the preposition
cliticizes to the clause-internal head of the relative clause (in the case of
definite relative clauses this internal head is the demonstrative following the
head NP).
     Pronominal PPs normally cliticize to the leftmost element capable of
hosting a clitic (verb, preverbal particle, demonstrative or noun functioning as
internal head of relative clause or focalized clause). In other words,
pronominal PPs are normally sentential clitics, like object and dative
pronominals and like directionals (Centripetal, Centrifugal). An example is
(269.a). However, when the pronominal PP is bracketed with a VblN that
functions, for example, as subject of a higher clause, the pronominal PP
remains bracketed with the VblN. This applies to dative clitics (269.b) as well
as to other pronominal PPs (269.c). For this 'may not' construction see

     The adjectival verbs that cannot take any subject prefixes in their
perfective forms (including PerfP and Resit), e.g. PerfP ksewal and Resit
kaewal 'be black', likewise lack prefixes in the corresponding participles,
including MaSg. The zeroing of FeSg t- would happen anyway before a CV...
stem onset (Prefixal t-Deletion, §7.4.1.2), but adjectival verbs also avoid
3MaSg i- prefix (§7.4.2), and this carries through to participles, e.g. the Resit
participles in as-hdbs kaswael-asn 'a black man', and t-a-maett kaewasl-ast 'a
black woman'.
     Given the limited set of prefixes in participialized verbs, Participial
suffixes are especially important. They express the same categories as we saw
in the prefixes (MaSg, FeSg, PI), with no gender distinction in the plural.
     In (499) I show the Participial suffixes. For morphological comparison, I
add the corresponding nominal gender-number suffixes, and 3rd person verbal
subject suffixes. Overall, the participles are sui generis, but have some
affinities with both nominal and verbal morphology (like participles in many
other languages). The stems to which Participial affixes are added are verb
stems, and the prefixes are those used with inflectable verbs. On the other
hand, the suffixes look more nominal than verbal, participles (as relative
clauses) are part of NP syntax, and the restriction of both prefixes and suffixes
to gender-number marking (with no person marking) is suggestive of nominal
rather than verbal morphology.

Note that suffix -aen is MaSg for participles, but MaPl for nouns.
    Participial FeSg -aet ends in a single t. Like the FeSg nominal suffix -aet
(§4.1.2.5), it has no special accentual effect, allowing antepenultimate default
accent as in t-ά t-aedobzen-aet 'the one-FeSg who married'. In this respect -set
contrasts with the common nominal FeSg suffix -t, which forces word-
penultimate accent (i.e. it behaves accentually as though it ended in a vowel,
§3.3.1.1).
    Participial -aen (MaSg) and -aet (FePl) induce VV-Contraction when the
preceding stem ends in a V. Specifically, they behave like 3MaPl subject
suffix -aen and 2MaPl subject suffix -aem. In other words, a stem-final
perfective lal in a non-augment verb combines with suffixal /as/ to give as, and
both V's are counted for purposes of Default Accentuation (resulting in surface
penultimate word accent after VV-Contraction): ά-sael wa-\dd osae-n 'the day
he came' (compare PerfP osae-n 'they-Ma came'). For contractions involving
augment verbs, see §8.5.5.","[502, 503]"

1.2 Literature on non-Tamashek Tuareg For Tamahak (Algeria), the major work is the great Dictionnaire touareg-
frangais (abbreviation DTF) of the famous (and famously assassinated) French
 officer and later missionary Charles de Foucauld (lived 1858-1916). DTF was
 published posthumously in four volumes (1951-52). It is now somewhat
 difficult to use because of its rarity, its great physical size (the handwritten
 manuscript was published by photography), and its not very modern
 orthography (""ou"" for w, ""i"" for y, ""r"" for Y, etc.). Foucauld had a hard time
 hearing the distinction between the two short vowels, and did not understand
 the accent system. Nevertheless, his dictionary is monumental, and its entries
 contain rich semantic detail with abundant exemplification, and not a little
 ethnographic material. Foucauld also made a serious effort to identify natural
 species. It is one of the greatest of all missionary dictionaries of its era.
     For Tamajak (Republic of Niger), the major work is the Lexique touareg-
frangais of Prasse et al. (2nd ed., 1998), which carefully distinguishes
 Tawellemett (""W"") from Tayert (""Y"") items throughout. This dictionary is of a
 high standard, uses a modern phonemic orthography, and has the necessary
 morphological data for each stem. Two shortcomings that will hopefully be
4    1 Introductionrectified in future editions are the absence of scientific identifications of flora-
fauna species, and the omission of accents on stems other than verbs (verbs
generally have grammatically predictable accents).
     For Burkina Faso we now have David Sudlow's handy work, The
Tamcisheq of north-east Burkina Faso (2001), which includes some lexical
lists organized by domains as well as grammatical information. The migrations
into Burkina began in earnest around 150 years ago and have been continuous,
as desertification has pushed Tuaregs south. The dialects spoken in Burkina
reflect the diverse origins of the migrants, but Tawellemett is well represented.
     Prasse's three-volume work, Manuel de grammaire touaregue (1972-74),
is an elaborate systematization of data from Foucauld from the Hoggar. In this
work, Prasse analyses Tuareg phonology and morphology (the fourth volume
on syntax did not appear), in historical linguistic terms. The Manuel is an
important work for Berberists, but the author's perspective is somewhat
idiosyncratic, since he connects attested modern Tuareg forms directly with
Pre-Proto-Berber reconstructions. Much of his interest was in presenting a Pre-
Proto-Berber reconstruction with three short vowels in addition to the less
controversial long (full) vowels. Synchronically, Tuareg has two short vowels
ae and a, which are themselves partially merged in some dialects depending on
following consonants, and the non-Tuareg Berber languages generally have
just one short vowel phoneme. Unfortunately, the Manuel was written before
the author's Niger-based Lexique,          and was therefore based largely on
Foucauld, whose transcriptions of short vowels for Tamahak were highly
unreliable. In addition, the Manuel (like the Lexique) was written in the
absence of good synchronic analysis of accent, which turns out to interact in
significant ways with the ablaut system. In general, the Manuel is of greatest
interest for its analysis of vocalic ablaut, and of a series of other, specific
historical linguistic issues.
     Another important recent work on Proto-Berber is Maarten Kossmann's
Essai sur la phonologie du proto-berbere           (1999). This is essentially a
collection of topical studies, addressing a number of cruxes of Berber
historical phonology.","[22, 23]"
"    Further kin terms of this regular type are ae-bdbas 'cross-cousin', a-jaeya
'great grandson', a-daeggal 'father- or son-in-law', and α-laggas 'brother-in-
law'. This is also the pattern for ""kin"" terms that are just special uses of
ordinary nouns in possessed form (e.g. 'child', 'man', 'woman').
                                          5.2 Possession and compounding     261     A handful of kin terms take a special set of pronominal possessive suffixes
given in (251), below. Since these nouns are a subset of the (semantically)
inalienable nouns in the language, for lack of a better term I call these suffixes
inalienable. The stems in question are V-final, so there is only one suffixal
series. All of the suffixes are distinct from their counterparts in the regular
possessive series (§5.2.2, just above). The Ο before some suffixes indicates
that the suffix forces penultimate word accent.
     The postconsonantal allomorphs for singular possessors are difficult to
elicit. The inalienable noun stems that end in a C are plural: taey- 'fathers
(of...)' and maessaw- 'owners/masters (of...)', and they normally require
plural possessors, as in täey-naer 'our fathers' and maessaw-kmaet 'your-FePl
masters'. In Tuareg society, one does not easily speak of the 'fathers' or
'masters' of a single person or object. In the case of 'father', the synonym
abba (250) can be used in its plural form (with alienable possessor suffix).
When pressed to combine Sg possessor suffixes with taey- or maessaw-,
informants grudgingly add -(e)v, -k, -m, and -s with no phonological difficulty
but find the combinations awkward. With maessaw- 'owners', I recorded lSg
maessaw-r (T-ka), maessaw-ex (R), and maessaw-i (A-grm).","[279, 280]"

1.5 Neighboring languagesIn the western part of their zone, i.e. around Timbuktu and from there west to
Goundam and beyond, Tamashek is spoken chiefly in villages that are not too
far from the Niger River. There are a number of Tamashek villages near
Timbuktu and Goundam, but the high desert farther north (e.g. Araouan,
Taoudenni) is basically Arab country. Moreover, in the sub-riverine area
8   1 Introductionwhere Tuareg-Bella groups are found, they are often in contact with Arab
groups, and both Arab and Tuareg-Bella minorities are found in the larger
towns and cities (Goundam proper, Timbuktu and its ports, Gourma Rharous).
The local Arabic vernacular is a variety of Hassaniya Arabic, the beduin
Arabic of Mali, Mauritania, and the Western Sahara. The local variety differs
somewhat from the better described Mauritanian norm, for example in
preserving short *u as a distinct phoneme. Comparison of Timbuktu-area
Hassaniya with Timbuktu-area Tamashek indicates that although Hassaniya
has many Berber loanwords, the latter are usually not from the (current) local
Tamashek varieties. It appears that most of the Berber lexical stratum in
Timbuktu Hassaniya derives either from non-local Berber languages
(including Zenaga in Mauritania), or from former Berber languages of the
Timbuktu area that are no longer extant locally. Tamashek likewise is deeply
impregnated with Arabic vocabulary, but much of it seems to reflect more
ancient Arab-Tuareg contacts, probably much farther north.
     Along the Niger River itself, thoughout the zone relevant to Tamashek, the
dominant languages are Koyra Chiini (e.g. Goundam, Timbuktu) and
Koyraboro Senni (from Gourma Rharous and Bamba through Gao to the
border with the Republic of Niger). These are the two major Songhay
languages of Mali. Koyra Chiini is of S-infl-V-0 type with traces marking
object extraction sites, while Koyraboro Senni is an S-infl-O-V-X language
with resumptive pronouns in extraction contexts. Current government
nomenclature lumps them together (along with other Songhay languages) as
""soqay,"" only the Koyraboro Senni dialect of Gao being taught in literacy
programs. In any event, the local Songhay variety is used in interethnic
communication (e.g. in the markets) and is generally learned by Tuaregs and
Bellas as a second language. As the Tuareg and Bella resettle into towns and
cities where a Songhay language predominates, and partially adjust in lifestyle
(e.g. shifting from milk and cheese to millet grain as a staple food), some
relevant Songhay vocabulary is creeping into Tamashek speech.
     In the major Tuareg concentration in the north around Kidal and the hills
of the Adrar des Ifoghas, there are no major competing languages, though
there are a few Arab villages and some Arab traders in the towns.
     In the Gourma (the area south of the Niger River), there are broad
expanses of flat, arid land away from the river that the Tuaregs and Bellas have
largely to themselves. However, as they approach the river they encounter
speakers of the Songhay languages mentioned above, and there are some
Songhay in Gosi (the only real town). At the southern fringe of the Gourma,
where the flat land is suddenly punctuated by the cliff faces of inselbergs, the
few local Tuareg encounter speakers of another Songhay language, Humburi
Senni of the Hombori area, along with ethnic Fula who speak either Fulfulde
or a variety of Koyraboro Senni called Foulan Kirya. Since many of the
Tuareg of the Gourma have migrated recently from the Timbuktu-Goundam
area, the local Tamashek variety seems to have been little affected by these
peripheral contacts.
                                             1.6 Fieldwork and other data    9    As noted above, around Menaka we get Tamajak instead of Tamashek
proper. In that zone, straddling the Mali-Niger border, there is also an
important nomadic group of cultural Tuaregs known as Daoussahak who speak
Tadaksahak. This language has a Songhay base (pronouns, inflectional
particles, maybe 250 items of core vocabulary), but most of the lexicon
(including some ""core"" items) is from Tuareg, and Tuareg influence in
grammatical categories, syntax, and prosody is conspicuous. There are also
some Fulfulde-speaking groups near the Niger River south of Menaka.
    Of these non-Tuareg languages, Arabic has had by far the greatest
influence on Tamashek, but the influence seems to be largely confined to
lexical borrowing. Of course loanwords in areas related to Islam and sharia law
(prayer, holy days, days of the week, lunar months, divorce) are very common,
but there are also some loans in other domains, sometimes from vernacular
rather than classical Arabic. Arabic loans may have spread within the Tuareg
domain, from dialect to dialect, or they may have entered different Tuareg
varieties independently. Many of the Arabic loans also occur in other regional
languages (e.g. Songhay, Fulfulde), and in some cases there are phonological
indications that an Arabic term passed first into Tuareg and from there into
languages farther south.","[26, 27, 28]"
