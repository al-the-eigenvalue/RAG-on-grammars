"     Modes are used in Arikara as well as in English.    In Arikara, how-
     ever, modes are expressed by prefixes to the verb.    Different modes
    take different prefixes.    They do not require changes in word order
     in the sentence as in English.    Thus, Arikara and English express
     mode in entirely distinct ways, although the meanings    (or speakei'’s
     attitudes)                  are        the        same.",[285]
"      The best way to learn these forms and their use is to memorize them.
      Since the verbs are regular, they can be easily analyzed.    You can
      work out all the forms from the 3rd person singular form which is
        iven for each verb in the chart below.  In addition, charts con-

 Singular form means all three:         The                  '

    The Arikara          language contains                       sounds      that are both            familiar and     un-
    familiar to          English speakers.                        There      are 22 sounds            in Arikara:
12     consonant          sounds        and     10    vowel         sounds.               Written    Arikara   has   just
22 symbols to represent these sounds, one symbol for each sound.
(A symbol is a letter or mark, or a combination of these.)    Although
Arikara is written in most of the same letters as English, the sound
value for some of the letters is different.   To read and write Arikara
accurately, you must learn the correct symbol for each sound and the
correct          sound     for     each       symbol.
                be asked to relate mos st of the Arikara sounds to
                                                                |  similar
                English sounds.   Keep in mind that this method does not
                give you the true quality of the Arikara sounds, only an
                approximation.   The best way to learn these sounds is to
                study them with an Arikara speaker.","[14, 15]"

three modes: negative, interrogative, and potential.                             The purpose of the
charts    is    to   present   a   variety    of   verbs   in   these       forms     sothat       you   may
learn them and refer to them when studying.   They are also an important
learning device: most of the sound changes that occur in Arikara verbal
inflection are contained in this sample; and when you have mastered this
material, you should be able to inflect new verbs that you learn, making
the correct sound changes.",[14]

    Berthold Indian Reserv-tion      in Notth Dakota.    This textbook   is
    designed    for use in a .eginning language class or for independent

    secondary    or pfestsecondary level.   It is hoped   that the book    also
    constitutes    a modest contribution    to the preservation    of the rich
    Arikara              linguistic                           heritage.              The          50      lessons           combine             in         their         themes
