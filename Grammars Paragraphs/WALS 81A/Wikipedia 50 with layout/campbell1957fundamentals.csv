in each case the word order is normal.","[404, 405]"
"        There is no comprehensive alphabetical order which includes both
  consonants and vowels as in European languages; each series has to be
  learned separately in its own order.",[25]
"1. The use of a Thai Dictionary usually presents some difficulty at first because
of the fact previously mentioned that the vowels have no place in the alphabeti-
cal order of the consonants but form a separate series of their own.
The words are arranged firstly in order of consonants, then in order of vowels
and finally in order of tone marks.",[417]
"      The arrangement of the words with reference to tone marks, which
 it must be remembered is a tertiary arrangement after their arrangement
 with reference to consonant order and vowel order is set out below with
 specific examples.",[418]
"19. A. 1. The Passive Voice.
         (a). The passive voice is generally used in Thai only when referring to
events of a violent or unpleasant nature.
When used it is denoted by the addition of the word TOOK (fl fl) in front
of the verb.
(This is the same word TOOK as you have already had meaning “cheap'

"20. A. 1. Double verbs.
         Double verbs are very common in the Thai language and are used in
two different ways.
(a) Two verbs may be used together to denote two separate actions as in
English.
In this case each verb carries its own full meaning and the English translation
can generally be considered as having the word “and” understood between
the two verbs.
        If there is an object it comes after the verbs in the normal manner.

         uiiiauviuiaomini
(b) A number of verbs in Thai can be used as adverbs to qualify or amplify
the meaning of the verbs.
In this case the two verbs are often called primary and secondary verbs, and
though this is a convenient nomenclature it is probably better in many cases to
think of the second verb as an adverb.
When two verbs are used in this manner, the object, if any, usually comes
between the primary and secondary or adverbial verb.
Some of the more common secondary verbs are set out below.
MAH “come” and PY “go”
          These two words are frequently used as secondary verbs or adverbs
and you have had some examples of this usage already. They indicate that the
action specified by the primary verb takes place toward or away from the speaker
or sortie other designated or implied position.
         For instance; if you ring up your soft drink suppliers you can say:
         SONG SODAH KOO-AT YY_MAH                   Send two dozen large soda
         TEE BAHN POM SORNG LO                      (come) to my house.
          I         S) ! 4, 9/
         fi-3 wnmfl mw jj'mu'mtnjriEM mn
but if you call in and see them it would be better to say:                                  — 241
        SONG SODAH KOO-AT YY_PY                           Send two dozen large soda

                                erThe meaning is exactly the same in each case, it is merely a matter of whether
the soda is being sent towards you or away from you.
Other examples are as follows.

   POP (VI11) “to meet” is generally used for “seeing” or “meeting” someone
   but not for “going to meet” someone, for which you must use another word
   RUP (See Lesson 7. A.4.)
   OW ( 101 ) means “to take” but it is not often used alone in this sense. It is
   usually combined with MAH “to come” or PY “to go” to mean “bring” or
   “take away”.
   Double verbs of this nature are a common feature of the Thai language and
   will be dealt with more fully in Lesson 20.
   You should note however that where there is an object it is placed between
   the two verbs. (Examples 3, 15.)
   OW also means “want”. You will come across this meaning later.
   TEENY (lil'MU) “anywhere” is the same word as you have had in
   Lesson 1 meaning “where”.
   You are not likely to find that these two different meanings cause you much
   trouble.

  DY m “can” is the same word as DY m “to get” (Lesson 7)
  PEU-AN (LH014) MIT (jJPll) Both these words mean “friend, companion”.
  PEU-AN is the most commonly used in conversation but you will come
  across MIT occasionally in reading and in certain compounded words.
  SEUNG ( CB4) T E E (Vl)Both these words mean “who”, “which” but
  TEE is in more general use than SEUNG which is rather more formal.

"2. To look up a word in a Thai dictionary proceed as follows.
   2.1 Look up the first consonant of the word in its place in the alphabetical
   order irrespective of whether or not it happens to be a silent consonant.
   Do not take any notice of a vowel form which may precede the first conso-
   nant; that will be considered later.

              REU “or”.

   to the second consonant.

   the consonant and then the vowel irrespective of the position of the vowel
   with relation to the consonant.
      fill!       SAHM “three”.
   Look up under ft and then after all the combinations of If with another
   consonant we come to AZ, fl and finally ?fl.

consonant go on through cl"", fl, etc. until you come to Icl
2.4 If there are two initial consonants the dictionary order of the word
depends on whether or not the vowel, if a simple one is predisposed, or if a
compound one, has a predisposed component. If the vowel is not predis-
posed or has no predisposed component we proceed as before and look up
the first consonant, then the second consonant and finally the vowel.
  fl?<u KROO “teacher”.
Look up under fl, then fl?, and finally fl?  ffinU    SABAI “happy”.
Look up under cf, then fill, and finally fill? fJ
     If the simple vowel is a predisposed one or the compound vowel has a
predisposed component we look up under the first consonant, then the
predisposed vowel form and then the other consonants and vowels in order
taking the consonant always before the vowel associated with it.

"        The Extended Vocabulary which follows contains all the words you
have had in the various sectional vocabularies as well as a large number of others
which are in fairly common use; about 2600 altogether.
         Be a little careful about picking new words out of the vocabulary and
using them. If they are nouns y®u can’t go far wrong as in most cases any one
noun can be substituted for another but adjectives, adverbs, prepositions and
verbs are very often used in certain contexts only and if you use them wrongly
you will not be understood.
For instance; POP (Mil) means “to meet” but “to meet someone at the airport”
is RUP ( A l ) “to receive”.
Again “for rent” is HY CHOW ( I n i ' l l ) and you cannot use SUMRUP CHOW.
You are more likely to be understood if you get the construction right even
if some of the tones are wrong than if all your tones are faultless but you use
the wrong words and get the rhythm of the sentence wrong. If you want to try
new words, and you should, check up with your teacher or a Thai friend first
if possible.
         Where a word has been dealt with specifically in a particular lesson
the number of the lesson is added after the word and this to some extent serves
as an index to the words with special usage. In most cases an example showing
the usage will be found in the lesson referred to or the following one.
        In order to save space many of the more obvious compound words
have been omitted as you should now be able to make these up yourself.
        e.g. TOOK “every” TOOK KON “everyone” TOOK WUN “every-
             day” etc.
        Thai words and syllables in brackets are those which are often omitted
in conversation.
        e.g. LORT FY (FAR) “electric light bulb”. Usually called LORT FY.
         No significance attaches to the fact that the English approximation
of the Thai spelling is sometimes written as two or more words; this is merely
done for clarity and to help in separation of the syllables.
        The tones of all words are shown by the small letters after the English
approximation using the following convention.",[429]
"        Inanimate objects have no gender and where it is necessary to indicate

ber, tense etc. being indicated where considered necessary by the addition of

"         In the Thai language we find many groups of two or more words
(mostly nouns) in which all members of the group have exactly the same mean-
ing but some are Formal or Polite words and others are Common words.",[31]
"         A negative sentence is formed by putting a negative word in front of
the verb or, in certain cases, after it. (See Lesson 7.)
        When a negative word qualifies an adjective it is usually placed between
the noun and the adjective (Example 21.)
         The future tense is indicated by putting the word JA “will”, “shall”
in front of the verb.
         In most cases questions in the future tense can be answered in the
present tense.
         The answer to a question is generally made as short as possible and in
many cases will consist only of a repetition of the verb in the case of an affirma-
tive answer, or the verb preceded by a negative word in the case of a negative
answer.
         The position of adverbs and adverbial clauses is variable. Generally the
adverb of time comes at the beginning of the sentence but we can add emphasis
to it by putting it at the end.
Other adverbs and adverbial clauses may go either at the beginning or end of
the sentence but the position of each particular one is usually fairly constant.
Adverbs or adverbial clauses seldom come in the middle of a sentence. For
instance;
       “Go to the market and buy some eggs”
would be rendered in Thai as,
         “Go buy some eggs at the market”
Interrogative adverbs and some adverbs of time such as “always”, “often”,
“soon” etc. are usually placed at the end of the sentence.",[31]
"24. A. 1. (a.) ( n )        The letter f) GOR standing alone or in combination with certain other
words occurs frequently in both conversation and writing and can be translated
in a wide variety of ways, depending on just how it occurs, and in some cases
cannot be translated at all.
   Some of the more common usages are as follows.   (i) It frequently introduces the main sentence after a conditional clause and
   in this case comes after the subject of the main sentence if any.",[326]

some of which are quite straightforward but others are rather complicated and
difficult to translate.(a) It can be used as a simple verb meaning “to give” and in this usage it
is often followed by the preposition GAA to separate the direct and indirect
objects.

          Once you realise the existence ot these double words they do not cause
you much trouble because in a great many cases they can be recognised bv the
fact that thev form an alliterative or euphonic combination.
          An important thing to note is that the word order in these combina-
tions is fixed and cannot be reversed.
These duplicated words fall broadly into two categories.

     at times may be used alone.

          The continuous tense in Thai is represented by putting the word
GUMLUNG “vigour” in front of the verb and the word YOO “to be located
at” after the verb and after the object if there is one.
          Sometimes GUMLUNG is used alone and sometimes YOO is used
alone. There does not appear to be any very firm rule governing which word or
words should be used in any particular case except that YOO is not generally
used if the verb is one indicating physical movement from one place to another.","[169, 170]"
