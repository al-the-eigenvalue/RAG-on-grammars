5.4.1 Word order in clauses
Typologically, word order in clauses means the order of subject, object and verb.",[222]
"The order of these three elements determines the ordering of other pairs ofelements in the language. For example, if a language is SOV, there is a greaterchance that the language will have postpositions. Thus the order of subject,object, and verb may determine the order of noun and adposition.",[222]

5.4 Word order typology of Jarawa
Though the term “word order typology” was in use for a long time, it wasGreenberg who brought the discipline to the forefront. Greenberg (1963) refers tolinguistic typology as a field which discusses the linguistic patterns of languagevis-à-vis some attributes. For instance, if a language is VSO, it will have                                                                                     203

prepositions. These kinds of attributes are discussed in length in Greenberg(1963). Basically, linguistic patterns were discussed with features like thecanonical pattern of subject, verb and object with reference to adpositions, noun-adjective relations, noun-genitive relations, and noun-numeral relations. Thissection focuses on word order in clauses, the position of the adposition, order ofnoun-adjective, noun-genitive, noun-numeral, adjective-intensifier, verb-adverb,and so on. This section will also investigate syntactic and morphological featurescorrelating with the word order as proposed by Greenberg (1963).","[221, 222]"

"
The order of A and ditransitive verbs is fixed. A precedes the O (IO and DO) andthe ditransitive verb follows the O, as in transitive clauses. However, the order ofthe objects is not fixed. The IO can follow the DO or precede it. Nonetheless, theposition of ɖi is fixed. Since ɖi is employed to specify the Object NP, it moveswith the direct object. The clausal structure of a ditransitive construction is givenin (4.44). The example (4.45) demonstrates the ordering of A, O, and verb inditransitive clauses.",[178]
"
Unlike the verb which follows the object, this copula precedes the nominalpredicates or adjectival predicates. Jarawa is an SOV language. The expectedword order is noun, then nominal predicate or adjectival predicate, followed bycopula. However, the copula is used between the subject and the nominalpredicate or adjectival predicate.          This copula may be inflected formodality/evidentiality, but we have few examples which demonstrate this.",[152]

4.9.1   Grammatical relations
Different grammatical roles and the relations between them can be expressed byvarious means at the syntactic level. Some languages employ case marking todifferentiate the different roles of the core arguments; some languages resort thefixed word order for the same purpose. In the case of Jarawa, grammaticalrelations between arguments are expressed through referential marking.","[205, 206]"
"
Jarawa is an SOV language: the subject precedes the object and the objectprecedes the verb. This occurs in simple sentences which have a subject, a sigleobject, and a verb. But when a simple sentence has two objects, the pattern maybe subject, direct object, indirect object, and verb. Or it may be subject, indirectobject, direct object, and verb. The difference between the two is that when thedirect object is moved to the position immediately after the subject, the verbcontains the information that there is a direct object inside the clause (for thedifference in representation of direct and indirect object, see § 4.3.4). Let usconsider the following examples.",[222]
"Hawkins, J. A. 1983. Word Order Universals. New York: Academic Press.",[264]
"
Jarawa makes use of verifiable evidential, assertive mood, and hypotheticalmood. We have noticed a word order phenomenon in this language, where thecopula precedes the nominal predicates or adjectival predicates.",[160]
"If a whole noun phrase is possessed, the order will be as presented in (5.19). Inthis language demonstratives and possessors are in complementary distribution.",[227]
"Jarawa distinguishes between descriptive and other types of adjectives likenumerals, demonstrative adjectives. Syntactically, the word order of descriptiveadjectives is different from that of other types. Though mentioned briefly in thesection on noun phrase, it would be better to go into detail about these adjectivesbelow.",[142]
"
As discussed in the section 4.1 as core arguments, a verbal clause can havesubjects (generally referred to S and A) and objects (referred to O). These S, A,and O are defined as: S, the subject of intransitive verbs; A, the subject oftransitive verbs; and O, the object of transitive verbs. This distinction is verysignificant, as these categories have different roles in the grammar of a language.",[170]
"
The chapter is organized as follows. Section 5.1 contains an overview oftypology, including morphological typology and word order typologyformulated by Greenberg, and the developments which followed (Hawkins(1983), Dryer (1992, 2007)). Section 5.2 presents a general outline of the typologyof Jarawa. Section 5.3 gives the morphological typology of Jarawa. Section 5.4aims at the word order typology of Jarawa with reference to Greenberg (1963). Abrief conclusion is presented in section 5.5.",[215]
"
Clause structures are also defined in terms of the arguments. In verbal clauses,the core arguments S (subject), A (agent), O (object) are defined in terms of the144

3.3.2.3 Case marking
There is no overt syntactic case marking in Jarawa to differentiate between nounsin their different grammatical roles. Generally word order serves this purpose.","[113, 114]"
"
In ditrasitive clauses, the position of A and the verb was found to be fixed indeclarative sentences, i.e. A always occurs at the beginning of the clause, and theverb at the end of clause. The order of I(ndirect) O(bject) and DO might change.",[246]
"
3.2 Word classes
In order to identify word classes in Jarawa, it is necessary to go beyond notionaldefinitions that entail much overlapping. Therefore, a scrutiny of different wordsis attempted through different diagnostic tests. Consequently, two more criteria,morphological diagnosis, and syntactic distribution, have been employed toidentify different word classes in Jarawa. The morphological test is based on thechoice of the occurrences of prefixes and suffixes with the root form. Specifically,the choice of a prefix or a suffix depends upon the lexical category of the root.",[93]
"5.4.6 Noun-adjective order
Jarawa adjectives follow the noun. However, this language distinguishesbetween descriptive adjectives and demonstratives/numerals. Descriptiveadjectives follow the noun. In example (5.14) huʈʰu ‘big’ follows the noun paʈʰo‘arrow’.
           (5.14) paʈʰo    huʈʰu                   arrow   big                   A big arrow.",[226]
"Syntactically, the predicate with its core argument expresses all types ofimperatives, whether request, command, advice, or order.",[186]

"
4.7.2   Wh-question
In wh-questions in Jarawa, some NPs in the clause are replaced correspondingquestion words (interrogative pronouns/adverbs). The wh-words stay in situ, i.e.the question word used for the subject NP would stay in canonical subjectposition and the question word used for the object NP would stay in canonicalobject position. Other question words (interrogative adverbs like when andwhere) also appear in canonical positions. Interrogative sentences with wh-words explored below.
1. onne ‘who’
The question word onne ‘who’ is used for humans. It can be employed for the Sargument of an intransitive verb, the A argument of a transitive verb, and anindirect object (including benefactors).
      (4.90)   onne   ɖi        olleg-ɖə          bəᵼʈʰe?               who    REF       Olleg-LOC         go               Who went to Olleg/Lakaralunda?",[190]
"
In (4.81), object has been put within the curly bracket (to show optionality) sinceintransitive verbs do not take an object. However, instead of an object someperipheral arguments like a spatial NP may come between the subject NP andthe verb.",[188]
"4.6.2   Prohibitive clauses
Prohibitives are a kind of command, order, or advice to not to do something. InJarawa, these are formed by putting the negative element naɖem after the verb,like it happens in simple negative sentences.
        (4.79) ullel    ɖə      bəᵼʈʰe   naɖem                 sea    LOC     go       NEG                 Don’t go in the sea.",[187]

                   Chapter 5: Jarawa and Typology
5.0 Introduction
The present study is a descriptive grammar of Jarawa. I would like to nowinvestigate the data in order to determine the position of Jarawa in a typologicalframework. So far Chapter 2 described the phonetics and phonology of Jarawa;Chapter 3 investigated the morphological properties of Jarawa; Chapter 4 was anattempt to discuss the syntactic structures in the language. This chapter willinvestigate which kinds of typological patterns this language demonstrates.","[214, 215]"
"
The sound inventory of Jarawa contains 41 sounds, of which 28 are consonantsand 13 are vowels. However, it is difficult to claim that all the sounds arephonemes in this language, for it is difficult to provide minimal pairs for everypair of sounds in order to establish the phonemic status of a particular sound.",[55]
"
4   Though this symbol represents high central unrounded vowel in IPA, I have used this symbol
for high-mid central unrounded vowel in order to avoid confusion with schwa.",[58]
"
Based on the initial description, the data was further investigated in order toplace Jarawa in the typological framework provided by Greenberg (1963) andlater supplemented by Hawkins (1984) and Dryer (2007).",[238]
"3.4.6   Function of prefixes
There are three types of prefixes generally attached to verbs. One is thepronominal, which, when attached to a verb as prefix, has two differentfunctions: (a) subject of intransitive verb or object of transitive verb, or (b) co-referencing element. Only third person pronouns can be used as co-referencingelements. These two different functions of pronominals are described here as twodifferent prefixes.",[134]
"
Pronominals are divided into three persons: first person, second person and thirdperson. Plural counterparts of these were not found. Morphologically,pronominals were found to behave differently from nouns. Pronominals attachto nouns as possessive prefixes, adjectives as subjects of complement clauses, andto verbs as subjects of intransitive verbs or objects of transitive verbs. Two formsof pronominals are also attested. These two forms were the “mi” form and the“ma” form. Phonologically these forms demonstrated vowel harmony in the caseof the possessive prefix. When the possessive prefixes are used as independentwords, “mi” form is used. In syntax the “mi” form was found to be used assubject whereas the “ma” form was used as object. Though the morphologicalbehaviour of pronominals indicated that they could possibly be considered as aclitic, in this study this phenomenon is left for further research.",[241]
"
Here there are two clauses: (1) [mi]NP [ujijə]NP [ɖ-ipale-jə]]VP ‘we will do fishing’and (2) [mi]NP [ɖi [bəᵼʈʰe-jə]VP ‘ we will go’. In (1), the verb is ipale ‘fish[V]’ and in (2)the verb is bəᵼʈʰe ‘go[V]’. ipale is a transitive verb; thus it takes NP ujiyə ‘a kind offish’ as an object NP. This results in the use of the referential marker ɖi with theobject ujiyə. mi ‘first person pronoun’ serves as a subject for both the clauses.",[196]
"
Some constructions involve the structure SUB + INTM + question word. Theseconstructions mostly contain the subject NP and the question word for ‘where’.",[193]
"In example (4.109) below, itʰəgə ‘cut’ is a transitive verb, so it takes an object NP;this object NP takes definiteness marker ɖi. This entire verb phrase can beconsidered as a clause, although the example in (4.109) differs from (4.107). In(4.107) both the verbs take the evidentiality suffix whereas in (4.109) only themain verb takes the evidential suffix. However, the absence of the suffix in(4.109) does not pose any problem to the analysis of the clause, instead the verb178
                                                                                   179
in (4.109) bəᵼʈʰe which is intransitive. In intransitive constructions, the subject NPtakes ɖi if headed by a noun; if headed by a pronoun, it does not take ɖi. ɖialways follows the NP it refers to. Thus, the ɖi in (4.109) does not refer to thesubject NP; for the subject NP is headed by a pronoun, and it is too far awayfrom the subject NP (see § 4.9 for conditions for the use of ɖi). Here it meansrefers to the dependent clause, or what we can call the clause internalcomplement clause.

"In the case of ditransitives, the direct object and indirect object exhibit free wordorder between them, but follow the overall SOV in which the subject precedesthe direct object, and direct object precedes the verb.

"
In segmental phonology, the sound inventory, syllabic structure, andphonological phenomena of the language were described. The discussion also

                                                                                221
included problems associated with the identification and establishment ofsounds as phonemes. In order to establish the phonemic status of a particularsound, four methodological principles were adopted. These principles werephonological contrast, variability among sounds, distribution of sounds andstatistical criterion.","[238, 239]"
"
In this construction, mi functions as possessor which is also used as a possessivemarker, so {mi} serves for both possessor and possessive prefix. But if thepossessor and the possessed are both nominals, the possessive prefix will getattached to the possessed noun and the order of noun phrase will be asillustrated in (3.41).
          (3.41)    innen           naja     wa-paʈʰo-le      huʈʰu     ʈʰuhumə                    Non-Jarawa      two      3POSS-arrow-PL big         very                    Non-Jarawa’s two big arrows.",[119]
"Here paʈʰo is only pronounced as /ʈʰo/. This phenomenon is very common inJarawa.
2.7.1   mi vs. ma
There are two forms of pronominals in each person in Jarawa. For the first personthere are /mi/ and /ma/, for second person /ŋi/ and /ŋa/ or /ni/ and /na/, and forthird person /hi/ and /hiwa/, though we have shorter forms for these pronominalswhich are not taken into consideration in this section. These pronominals areused in the positions of subject and object of a verb, and as possessive pronouns.",[87]
"
Jarawa does not show tense or aspect marking on the verbs, nor does it haveagreement marked on the verbs. However, a verb takes suffixes and prefixeswith the proviso that only one prefix and one suffix can attach to the verb at atime. The principle function of suffixes in this language is to convey mood,modality, and evidentiality; the prefix indicates the presence of the direct object.",[221]
"
Two different kinds of complement clauses were also discussed. These two typesof clauses were clause internal and clause external complement clauses. In aclause internal complement clause, the complement clause occurs within themain clause in the object position of the verb phrase. Clause externalcomplement clauses were described as instances of direct speech in thislanguage. Since the language was found to be SOV, meaning the object occupies                                                                             229

the slot before verb, these kinds of constructions were considered as clauseexternal complement clauses.","[247, 248]"
"
3.4.7.2 Syntactic causatives
Syntactic causatives are formed using the independent word for causation alongwith the lexical verb. In the present study it is, however, difficult to establishwhether the independent word for causation is a causative verb. Hence in thiswork    the   independent       word    is   glossed   as   causative    (CAUS).   Themodality/evidentiality suffix is attached to the main verb rather than thecausative (verb).",[140]
"
3.4.6.1 Pronominals
Pronominals in Jarawa are more likely to be prefixed to verbs that start with avowel. Subject pronominals attach to an intransitive verb while objectpronominals attach to a transitive verb. If the verb is ditransitive, neither subjectnor indirect object pronominals attach to the verb. The nature and distribution ofthese pronominals have been discussed in detail in § 3.3.1.1. Therefore, in thissection we will concentrate only on the use of the definiteness/referential markerand co-referencing marker.",[135]
"
Four word formation processes were confirmed. These word formation processeswere compounding, denominalisation, reduplication, and the use of emptymorpheme. In compounding, three combinations were substantiated: noun-noun, noun-adjective, and noun-noun-adjective. In the denominalisation process,we saw that nouns are denominalised to verbs with the help of a suffix. Inreduplication,   Jarawa   demonstrates     syllable   reduplication   and   wordreduplication. As for word reduplication, the corpus suggested that verbs werereduplicated to serve the function of adverbial modifiers.",[244]

We can deduce from the preceding observation that whether a sound is aphoneme or allophone is not always distinct. This difficulty arose duringresearch mainly due to lack of minimal pairs for each pair of sounds. Further,those pairs of sounds which have minimal pairs also demonstrate some variation
                                                                                    37

in the words. In order to assert a conclusive result in such circumstances weneeded to enquire the phonological knowledge of speakers. Phonologicalknowledge of speakers contains the phonological contrast which amounts tominimal pairs. However, when a community is monolingual, it becomes difficultto decipher every aspect of phonological contrast for each phoneme. In thiscontext it is important to state the methodological principles adopted to identifyphonemes. Four methodological principles were employed to state the phonemicstatus of a sound in this language.","[55, 56]"
"5.4.2 Peripheral arguments
Like other SOV languages, Jarawa places peripheral arguments and/oradpositional phrases before the verb. The peripheral arguments and/oradpositional phrases are not syntactic arguments of a verb, but demonstrate thesame pattern as object and verb. The precise positions these arguments occupy in                                                                                 205

syntactic structures could vary. In intransitive clauses these arguments will justprecede the verb while in transitive clauses they may occur before the object. Theexample in (5.8) illustrates the use of a peripheral argument of an intransitiveverb, where the peripheral argument olleg ‘place name’ precedes the verb asobject. Example (5.9) shows the position of the peripheral argument olleg ‘placename’ which precedes the object, and therefore precedes the verb.
      (5.8)   tenmej           olleg           ɖə      bəᵼʈʰe              Tenmey           Olleg           LOC     go              Tenmey will go to Olleg/Lakralunda.      (5.9)   kiʈaje            ŋi     olleg         ɖə     napo ɖi      aikʰwa              yesterday 2              Olleg         LOC    fish   REF   kill              Yesterday you killed the fish at Olleg/Lakralunda.","[223, 224]"
"The sentence (3.99) can also mean only the phrase ‘these arrows’. It is difficult tosyntactically assess whether (3.99) is a clause or a phrase. If this phrase isemployed as a subject or an object of a clause, then it can be interpreted as ademonstrative adjective. For instance, in example (3.100), luwə paʈʰo-le ‘those
                                                                                  125

arrows’ is an example of a demonstrative adjective as this entire noun phrase isused as an object of the clause.
           (3.100)   luwə           paʈʰo-le   ɖ-eŋge                     DEM-A         arrow-PL    REF-bring                     Bring those arrows.","[143, 144]"
"After scrutiny it was found that Jarawa has six kinds of word classes: noun, verb,pronoun, adjective, adverb, and postposition. Nouns, verbs, adjectives andadverbs are open classes, where nouns and verbs are abundant while adjectivesand adverbs are fewer in number; postpositions and pronouns are closed classeswith a small number of lexemes. In (3.1) these classes are arranged in decreasingorder of the number of words in each class.",[93]

5.3.2 Noun morphology
Jarawa employs a three-way classification of nouns: human body parts, kinshipterms, and other nouns. The human body parts and kinship terms are boundroots whereas other nouns are free roots. Human body parts obligatorily takedefinite possessive prefix or indefinite human generific possessive prefixes whilekinship terms carry only the definite possessive prefix obligatorily. In example(5.1) oɖə ‘hair’ cannot occur as a free root if it refers to human hair; it must take apossessive prefix which may be the indefinite human generic possessive prefixən- as in (5.1), or the definite possessive prefix like in (5.2). Similarly, awela‘brother-in-law’ never occurs independently; it must occur with a definitepossessive prefix like in (5.3). Other nouns like napo ‘fish’, noha ‘bird’ čaɖɖa ‘hut’occur as free roots. These nouns take a possessive prefix only when semanticsrequires it.
           (5.1) ən-oɖə                   POSS[HUMAN]-hair                   human hair           (5.2). m-oɖə                   1POSS-hair                   my hair           (5.3)   m-awela                   1POSS-brother-in-law                   my brother-in-law (wife’s brother)                                                                                   201

Countable nouns are divided into two, singular and plural. Singular nouns bearzero affixation while plural nouns take plural suffix /-le/, though plural markingis not obligatory. Nouns do not bear grammatical gender markings. No syntacticcase marking is carried on nouns, i.e. subject, direct object and indirect objecthave zero case marking. This language has definiteness/referential marking ondirect object and indirect object, which differentiates subject and object of aclause. The language makes use of semantic case marking for location, temporaland spatial nouns.","[218, 219, 220]"

3.3.1.1.1 Morphological nature of personal pronouns
Pronominals in Jarawa can occur independently or can be attached to nouns,verbs, adjectives or some other words. They can attach to a noun as a possessiveprefix; they can be prefixed to a verb either as an S(ubject) argument of anintransitive verb or as an O(bject) argument of a transitive verb; and they canalso attach to predicative adjectives as their S argument.",[98]
