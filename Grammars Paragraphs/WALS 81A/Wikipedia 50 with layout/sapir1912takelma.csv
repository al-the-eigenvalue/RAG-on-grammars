  It should not be concealed that a few words (such as hiilin ocran,
tlaga‘m LAKE, and yuk!um-a- BONES) do not seem to conform to the
phonetic law implied by the table; but more exact knowledge of the
etymology of these and similar words would doubtless show such
disagreement to be but apparent. It is probable that in delga‘n-
BuTTocks,       bilga‘n-      BREAST,      and   do’lk‘in-i-   anus,   the g, (k')   im-
mediately following upon the / prevented the expected dissimila-
tion of n to m; in le’k‘wan- anus the dissimilation was perhaps
thwarted by a counter-tendency to dissimilate the two labials (k‘¥                          -
and m) that would thus result. *yalan-an- Lose (tr.), dissimilated,
as we have seen, to yalal-an-, fails to be further dissimilated to *yalal-
am- because, doubtless, there is a feeling against the obscuring of
the phonetic form of the causative suffix -an-.                 The great probability
of the existence of a dissimilatory tendency                    involving   the change
of n to m is clinched by the form do'lk‘im-i- anus alongside of
do'Tk*in-1-.
   A dissimilation of an original J to n (the reverse of the process first
described), because of an / in the stem, is found in
        yilt‘nma’n I keep asking for it (= original *y2#lma’¢n [1 inserted
           as repetition of stem -I- in iterative formation from yilima’*n

        le*ba’nade® I am carrying (object not specified) (= original *Jee-
           ba'lade‘) ; cf. identical suffix -al-z-, e. g., gayawa'lade‘ I eat.
In a*gwa’nade* I prink (stem dgw-), it hardly seems plausible that
-an-z- is at all morphologically different from the -al (-an) -z- of these
words, yet no satisfactory reason can be given here for a change
of the Z to n.
                           § 22.   CATCH    DISSIMILATION
   If to a form with a glottal catch in the last syllable is added a syn-
tactic (conjunctive) element, itself containing a catch, the first catch
is lost, but without involving a change in the character of the pitch-
accent; the loss of the catch is frequently accompanied by a length-
ening of the preceding vowel (or rather, in many cases, a restoration
of the original length). This phonetic process finds its most frequent
                                                                                22 §

§ 28. INFLUENCE        OF   PLACE AND KIND OF            ACCENT       ON    MANNER
                              OF ARTICULATION     The general phonetic rule may be laid down that an aspirated surd,
when not immediately followed by another consonant, can, with com-
paratively few exceptions, be found as such medially only when the
accent immediately precedes, provided that no consonant (except in
certain circumstances J, m, and n) intervene between the accented
vowel and the aspirated surd; under other conditions it appears
as a media. This phonetic limitation naturally brings about a con-
stant interchange between the aspirated surd and the correspond-
ing media in morphologically identical elements.               _Thus we have as
doublets -da and -t‘a j third person possessive pronoun of certain nouns:
       bemt‘a* his stick
       se’ lt‘a* his writing
       wila’ut‘a* his arrow
       ga’'lt‘a* his bow
       mo’t‘a* his son-in-law; but
       da’gazda his head
and numerous other nouns with -z-.              This consonant in itself, as we
have seen, demands a following media.              Another pair of doublets is
-dé and -t‘e‘, first person singular subject           intransitive        aorist     (-d¢
and -t'e¢ to correspond in future) :
       p‘ele’zade® I go to fight; p‘elza’t‘e® I shall go to war
       yant‘e® I go; yana’t‘e® I shall go
       nagatt‘e® I say; na’t‘e® I shall say

     wits lismade£ I keep moving; future wits/e’smade® (contrast
        wits: lift‘es I move and wisma’t‘e® I shall move)
Other examples of interchange are:
     sgo""t'sga’t't he cut them to pieces; sgd’“t'sgidi'n I cut them to
         pieces
        ts imimt‘atn I boil it, s-Amt‘an I shall boil it (stem s-ii“m-t'c-) ;
          s‘omoda’én I boil it, s‘omda’n I shall boil it (evidently related
           stem s‘om-d-)
        s‘as‘intp'ik* we stand; e*bi‘k* we are
   This phonetic rule must not be understood to mean that a media
can never appear under the conditions given for the occurrence of a
surd. The various grammatical elements involved are not all on
one line. It seems necessary to assume that some contain a surd as
the primary form of their consonant, while others contain an organic
media.       The more or less mechanical changes in manner of articula-
tion, already treated of, have had the effect, however, of so inextri-
vably interlocking the aspirated surds and mediae in medial and
final positions that it becomes difficult to tell in many cases which
manner of articulation should be considered the primary form of the
consonant.       Some of the medially occurring elements with primary
tenuis are:
        -t‘a, third person possessive
        -t'a, exclusive (as in k/wa/It‘a young, not old; younger one)
        -t‘e®, first person intransitive aorist (future, -t'e*)
     -t‘ek‘, first person singular possessive (as in ga’lt‘ek’ my bow)
Such elements show an aspirated consonant whether the preceding
accent be rising or falling; e. g., bémt‘a like he’ ‘lta. Some of those
with primary media are:
     -da, third person possessive with preceding preposition (corre-
        sponding not to first person -t'ek‘, -dek’, but to -dé)
        -a/ld- and -a’md- indirect object
        -da‘, subordinating element         .
This second set regularly keep the media whether the accent imme-
diately precedes or not. The first two of these generally, if not
always, require the preceding accent to be a falling one:
        dak‘wili’‘da on his house
        hat‘ga’*da in his country
        xa*sa'lda between his toes
        xa*ha’mda on his back
         3045°—Bull. 40, pt 2-124                                       § 23

       sgelewa'lda‘n I shout to him
       ts/elela’mda‘n I paint it
The third retains its primary character as media when the preceding
verb form has the falling accent:
       yewe’uda® when he returned
       naga’-idaé when he said
       baxa’mda* when he came
       hele’ldaé when he sang
       zebe’ndat when he did it
On the other hand it appears as an aspirate tenuis when preceded by
the rising accent:
       lalét‘a® as it became
       s‘as‘init‘a® when he stood
     The rule first given, when interpreted in the light of a reconstructed
historical development, would then mean that a rising accent preserved
an immediately following aspirated surd (including always those
cases in which 1, m, or n intervened), and caused the change of a
media to an aspirated surd; while a falling accent preserved a simi-
larly situated media or aspirated surd in its original form. That the
change in the phonetic circumstances defined of an origina: media to
an aspirated surd is indeed conditioned by a preceding rising accent,
is further indicated by such rather uncommon           forms as hadedi-t'a
EVERYWHERES.         Here   the -t'a is evidently the same as the -da of
hawilv’‘da IN HIS HOUSE, and the difference in manner of articulation
is doubtless in direct relation to the difference of accent.
   A modification of the general phonetic rule as first given remains
to be mentioned.    After 1, m, or n an original aspirated tenuis retains
its aspiration even if the accent falls on the preceding syllable but
one; also after a short vowel preceded by 1, m, or n, provided the
accented vowel is short.       Examples are:
       alwe’k/alt‘e* I shall shine; alwe’k!alp‘tgam we shall shine; alwe’-
          klalk‘wa to shine
       k‘e’p‘alt‘e* I shall be absent; k‘e’p‘alk‘wa to be absent
       wiili'hamt‘e® I have menstrual courses for the first time

   It will be observed that the insertion of the his practically the same
phonetic phenomenon as the occurrence of an aspirated tenuis instead
of a media after an accented vowel.      The vowel, nasal, or liquid may
appropriately enough be considered as having become aspirated under
the influence of the accent, just as in the case of the mediae.

ican languages in that it is thoroughly incorporating, both as regards
the pronominal, and, though somewhat less evidently, the nominal
object.     If by “‘polysynthetic” is merely meant the introduction into
the verb-complex of ideas generally expressed by independent ele-
ments (adverbs or the like), then Takelma is also polysynthetic, yet
only moderately so as compared with such extreme examples of the
type as Eskimo or Kwakiutl.         The degree of intimacy with which
the pronominal objective elements on the one hand, and the nominal
objective and polysynthetic (instrumental and local) elements on the
other, are combined with the internal verb-structure is decidedly
different. The former combine as suffixes to form an indissoluble
part, as it were, of the verb-form, the subjective elements of the
transitive verb, though in themselves absolutely without independent
existence, being secondarily attached to the stem already provided
with its pronominal object. The latter vary in degree of independ-
ence; they are strung along as prefixes to the verb, but form no integral
part of its structure, and may, as far as grammaticul coherence is
concerned, fall away entirely.
  The polysynthetic character of the Takelma verb (and by discuss-
ing the verb we touch, as so frequently in America, upon the most vital
element of the sentence)      seems, then, a comparatively    accidental,
superimposed feature. To use the term “polysynthetic” as a catch-
word for the peculiar character of Takelma, as of many another
American language, hardly hits the core of the matter.       On the other
hand, the term “incorporation,” though generally of more value as 8
classificatory label than “‘ polysynthesis,” conveys information rather
as to the treatment of a special, if important, set of concepts, than
as to the general character of the process of form-building.
   If we study the manner in which the stein unites in Takelma with
derivative and grammatical elements to form the word, and the vocalic
and consonantic changes that the stem itself undergoes for gram-
matical purposes, we shall hardly be able to find a tangible difference
     § 25
Boas]        HANDBOOK     OF   INDIAN   LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                 58in general method, however much the details may vary, between
‘Takelma and languages that have been dignified by the name “ inflec-
tional.’”’ It is generally said, in defining inflection, that languages
of the inflectional as contrasted with those of the agglutinative type
make use of words of indivisible psychic value, in which the stem and
the various grammatical elements have entirely lost their single indi-
vidualities, but have “chemically”        (!) coalesced into a single form-
unit; in other words, the word is not a mere mosaic of phonetic
materials, of which each is the necessary symbol of some special
concept   (stem) or logical category (grammatical element).
   In support of the actual existence of this admired lack of a one-
to-one correspondence between a grammatical category and its pho-
netic expression is often quoted the multiplicity of elements that
serve to symbolize the same concept; e. g., Lat. -i, -ae, -a, -és, -iis, all
indicate that the idea of a plurality of subjects is to be associated
with the concrete idea given by the main body of the words to
which they are attached. Furthermore, variability of the stem or
base itself is frequently adduced as a proof of its lack of even a
relative degree of individuality apart from the forms from which
by analysis it has been abstracted; e. g., German bind-, band-, bund-,
bdnd-, biind-. These two characteristics are very far indeed from
constituting anything like a definition of inflection, but they are
often referred to as peculiar to it, and hence may well serve us as
approximate tests.                                          .
   As regards the first test, we find that just such a multiplicity of
phonetic symbols for the same, or approximately the same, concept,
is characteristic of Takelma. The idea of possession of an object by
@ person or thing other than the speaker or person addressed is
 expressed by -2a, -a, -da (-t‘a), +t’, or +, all of which are best rendered
 by HIs, HER, ITS, THEIR (the ideas of gender and number do not
 here enter as requiring grammatical expression).         Similarly, the idea
 of the person speaking as subject of the action or state predicated
 by the main body of the verb is expressed by the various elements
 te’ (de®), -t'e* (-de*), -'n, -n, -k‘a® (-ga*), all of which are best ren-
 dered in English by “I.”       -¢'ef is confined to the aorist of intransi-
 tive verbs; -t‘e* is future intransitive; -'n is aorist transitive; -n is
 future transitive; and -k‘a‘ is used in all inferential forms, whether
 transitive or intransitive.
                                                                      § 25
54                 BUREAU    OF   AMERICAN   ETHNOLOGY               (BULL.40   As for the second test, it soon appears that the Takelma stem may
undergo even more far-reaching changes than we are accustomed to
in German or Greek. ‘ As examples may serve:

      natg-, ne°-, naga-, nege- say to
The first form in each of these sets is the verb-stem, properly speak-
ing, and is used in the formation of all but the aorist forms.           The
second is employed in non-aorist forms when the incorporated object
of the verb is a first person singular, and in several derivative forma-
tions. The third is characteristic of the aorist. The fourth is used
in the aorist under the same conditions as determine the use of the
second forin of the stem in other groups of forms.        It needs but a
moment’s thought to bring home the general psychic identity of such —
stem-variability and the ‘“ablaut”’ of many German          verbs,    or the    —
Latin stem-variation in present and perfect:
      frang- : frég- break
       da- : ded- give
   If the typical verb (and, for that matter, noun) form of Takelma is
thus found to be a firm phonetic and psychic unit, and to be charac-
terized by some of the supposed earmarks of inflection, what is left
but to frankly call the language “inflectional”? ‘‘Polysynthetic’”’ and
‘“‘incorporative” are not in the slightest degree terms that exclude
such a designation, for they have reference rather to the detailed
treatment of certain groups of concepts than to morphologic method.
Everything depends on the point of view. If chief stress for purposes
of classification is laid on the relative importance and fulness of the
verb, Takelma is polysynthetic; if the criterion of classification be
taken to be whether the verb takes the pronominal object within its
structure or not, it is incorporating; if, finally, stress be laid on the
general method of building up the word from smaller elements, it is
inflective. Not that Takelma is in the least thereby relegated to a
peculiar or in any way exceptional position. A more objective, un-
hampered study of languages spoken in various parts of the world
will undoubtedly reveal a far wider prevalence than has been gener-
ally admitted of the inflectional type.      The error, however, must not
be made of taking such comparatively trivial characteristics as sex
gender, or the presence of cases, as criteria of inflection.    Inflection
has reference to method, not to subject-matter.

Boas)          HANDBOOK     OF    INDIAN    LANGUAGES—-TAKELMA                   55                    Grammatical        Processes (§§ 26-32)
                        § 26.     General     Remarks
   There are four processes employed in Takelma for purposes of
grammatical modification and word-formation:                affixation (pre-, in-,
and suffixation), reduplication, vocalic change             (ablaut), and conso-
nant change       (consonant     ablaut).    Pitch-accent    is   of   grammatical
importance, but       is most     probably    a product     of    purely   phonetic
causes. Of the processes mentioned, suffixation is by far the most
important, while the presence of infixation will have to be allowed or
denied according to the definition given of it.
                               § 27. Prefixation
   Prefixation is either of the loose polysynthetic type already referred
to, or of the more firmly knit inflective type.             Loose prefixation is
extremely common, nominal objects, instruments, and local ideas of
one kind or another finding admittance into the word-complex, as
we have seen, in thismanner. Examples of such loose prefixation are:
        gwen-‘a'l-yowo! he looked back (gwen- in back; al- is difficult to
           define, but can perhaps be best described as indicative of action
           away from one’s self, here with clear implication of sight directed
           outward; yowo’' he was, can be used as independent word)
        s-in-i-lats!agi’‘n I touched his nose (s‘in- nose; 7- with hand;
           lats!agi’*n I touched him, as independent word)
        gwent‘ge’m black necked (gwen- nape, neck; t‘ge‘m black)
   The first example shows best the general character of loose prefixa-
tion.     The prefixed elements gwen-, al-, s‘in-, and 7- have no separate
existence as such, yet in themselves dire-tly convey, except perhaps
d-, a larger, more definitely apperceived, share of meaning than falls
 to the lot of most purely grammatical elements.  In dealing with
 such elements as these, we are indeed on the borderland between
 independent word and affix.          The contrast between them.and gram-
 matical suffixes comes out strongest in the fact that they may be
 entirely omitted without destroying the reality of the rest of the
 word, while the attempt to extract any of the other elements leaves
 an unmeaning remainder. At the same time, the first example well
 illustrates the point that they are not so loosely attached but that
 they may entirely alter the concrete            meaning    of the word.       Pre-
 fixation of the inflective type is very rare.              There is only       one
                                                                        §§ 26-27

                              § 28. Suffixation
  Suffixation is the normal method employed in building up actual
forms of nouns and verbs from stems. The suffixes in themselves
have for the most part very little individuality, some of them being
hardly evident at all except to the minute linguistic analyst.   The
notions they convey are partly derivational of one kind or other.
In the verb they express such ideas as those of position, reciprocal
action, causation, frequentative action, reflexive action, spontaneous
activity, action directed to some one, action done in behalf of some
one.     From the verb-stem such adjectival and nominal        derivations
as participles, infinitives, or abstract nouns of action, and nouns of
agent are formed by suffixation. In the noun itself various suffixed
elements appear whose concrete meaning is practically nil. Other
suffixes are formal in the narrower sense of the word.      . They express
pronominal elements for subject and object in the verb, for the pos-
sessor in the noun, modal elements in the verb. Thus a word like
tlomézinik’ WE KILL ONE ANOTHER contains, besides the aorist stem
tlomé- (formed from dé“m-), the suffixed elements -z- (expressing
general idea of relation between subject and object), -in- umlauted
from -an- (element denoting reciprocal action [-2-in-=EACH OTHER,
ONE ANOTHER]), and -ik‘ (first personal plural subject intransitive
aorist). As an example of suffixation in the noun may be given
tlibagwa‘n-t'k‘ my PancrEAS.      This form contains, besides the stem
iliba-, the suffixed elements -gw- (of no ascertainable concrete signifi-
cance, but employed to form several body-part nouns; e. g., ¢/iba‘k‘”
PANOREAS 47.17), -an- (apparently meaningless in itself and appear-
ing suffixed to many nouns when they are provided with possessive
endings), and -¢‘k‘ (first personal singular possessive).
                              § 29. Infixation
     Infixation, or what superficially appears to be such, is found only
in the formation of certain aorist stems and frequentatives.         Thus
the     aorist stem maislag- (from masg- PuT)     shows   an intrusive or
      §§ 28-29
Boas}          HANDBOOK      OF    INDIAN     LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                           57infixed -a- between the s (strengthened to ¢s/) and g of the stem.
Similarly the aorist        stem    wits'/im-        (from wism-    MOVE)     shows       an
infixed i. Infixation in frequentative forms is illustrated by:
     yonoina’*n I always sing (aorist stem yonon-)
        ts/ayatk‘ he used to shoot them (cf. ts/aya‘k* he shot them)
   On examination it is found that the infixed element is invariably
a repetition of part of the phonetic material given by the stem.
Thus the infixed -a- and -i- of mats!ag- and wits:!im- are repetitions
of the -a- and -i- of the stems masg- and wism-; the infixed -i- of
yonoin- and ts/ayaig- are similarly repetitions of the y- of yonon
and -y- of ts!ayag-.        It seems        advisable,    therefore, to consider all
cases of infixation rather as stem-amplifications related to reduplica-
tion. An infixed element may itself be augmented by a second
infixation.      Thus we have:
           Verb stem                   Aorist stem                 Frequentative
        hemg- take out                 hemeg-                      heme*mg-

                             § 30. Reduplication
   Reduplication is used in Takelma as a grammatical process with
surprising frequency, probably as frequently as in the Salish languages.
The most interesting point in connection with it is probably the fact
that the reduplicating increment follows the base, never, as in most
languages       (Salish,   Kwakiutl,     Indo-Germanic), precedes             it.    It    is,
like the infixation spoken of above, employed partly in the formation
of the aorist, partly        to express       frequentative    or usitative         action.
Some nouns show reduplicated stems, though, as a process, redupli-
cation is not nearly as important in the noun as in the verb. Some
verbs, including a number that do not seem to imply a necessary’
repetitive action, are apparently never found in unreduplicated form.
Four main types of reduplication, with various subtypes, occur:
   1. A partial reduplication, consisting of the repetition of the vowel
and final consonant of the stem:
        aorist helel- (from he‘l- sing)
        aorist t/omom- (from d6%m- kill)
The reduplicated vowel is lengthened in certain forms, e. g., hele‘l-,
tlomd*m-.
                                                                                    § 30
58                    BUREAU    OF AMERICAN     ETHNOLOGY                [BULL.40   1a. A subtype of 1 is illustrated by such forms as exhibit an
unreduplicated consonant after the reduplicated portion of the word,
the second vowel in such cases being generally long
       aorist ts* liimii#mt'a- (from s*iimt‘a- boil)
       usitative aorist ¢/ili“lg- (from verb stem ¢/ii/g-, aorist tliliig-
          follow trail)
     ’ usitative aorist gini‘ng- (from verb stem ging-, aorist ginig- go to;
         ging-, ginig- itself is probably reduplicated from gin-)
     2. A complete reduplication, consisting of the repetition of the
entire base with a change of the stem-vowel to a:
       aorist t/éut/au- (from tléu- play shinny)
      aorist bot'bad- (from bd%d- pull out one’s hair)
      aorist ba°- sal- zo(x)zag come to a stand (pl.); aorist salaogi
         stand (pl.)
   3. A complete reduplication, as in 2, with the addition of a con-
necting vowel repeated from the vowel of the stem:
      aorist yuluyal- (cf. verb stem yulyal- rub)
       aorist frequentative hogohag- keep running (from hd“g- run)
       aorist frequentative s‘wilis-wal- tear to pieces; verb stem s-wil-
            s-‘wal- (from aorist s‘wi‘ls-wal- tear; verb stem s-wi*l-)
If the stem ends in a fortis consonant, the reduplicating syllable
regularly shows the corresponding media (or aspirated tenuis) :
       sgotlosgad- cut to pieces (from verb stem sg6""t/-, aorist sgd“d- cut)
     3a. A subgroup of 3 is formed by some verbs that leave out the -a
of the reduplicating syllable:
        guidik‘“d- throw (base gwid-)
     4. An irregular reduplication, consisting of a repetition            of the
vowel of the stem followed by -(‘)a- + the last and first (or third)
consonants of the stem in that order:
     frequentative aorist t/omoamd-, as though instead of *t/ome
         tlam-; cf. non-aorist d6%mdam- (from aorist t/omom- kill)
       frequentative aorist k/!eme‘amg- (from k!eme-n- make; verb stem
         klem-n-)
       frequentative aorist pliwi‘aug-, as though instead of *p/aiwitp!aug-
            (from aorist p/iwik!- name)
It will be noticed that verbs of this type of reduplication all begin
with fortis consonants. The glottal catch is best considered a partial
representative of the initial fortis; in cases like k/eme‘amg- an original
     § 30
Boas]          HANDBOOK       OF INDIAN   LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                59-k!am (i. e., -""gam) may be conceived of as undergoing partial meta-
thesis to -‘amg.
   Other rarer reduplications or stem-amplifications occur, and will be
treated in speaking of aorist formations and frequentatives.
                               § 31.   Vowel-Ablaut  Vowel-ablaut consists of the palatalization of non-palatal stem-
vowels in certain forms. Only o and a (with corresponding long
vowels and diphthongs) are affected; they become respectively
it (@) and     e.     In   sharp contradistinction   to the 7- umlaut   of an
original a to i, this ablaut affects only the radical portion of the
word, and thus serves as a further criterion to identify the stem.
Thus we have we‘ga’si HE BROUGHT IT TO ME (from stem wa%-,
as shown also by wa%g-iwi’/'n I BROUGHT IT TO HIM), but wege’sink‘
HE WILL BRING IT TO ME (from stem waga-, as shown also by waga-
wi’n LL BRING IT TO HIM), both 2- umlaut and stem-ablaut serving
in these cases to help analyze out the stems.            Vowel-ablaut occurs
in the following cases:
    1. Whenever        the object of the transitive verb or subject of the
passive is the first person singular:
     mele'xi he told it to me 172.17, but mala’xbitn I told it to you
           (162.6)
        nege’s't he said to me 186.22, but naga’sam he said to us (178.12)
        dimzina‘ I shall be slain (192.11), but démzbina‘ you will be slain
           (178.15)
     gel-lihtiigwa’ si he avenges me, but -lohoigwa’‘n I avenge him (148.3)
 Not infrequently vowel-ablaut in such cases is directly responsible for
 the existence of homonyms, as in yeweyagwa'si HE TALKS ABOUT ME
 (from yaway-talk), and yeweyagwa’si HE RETURNS WITH ME (from
 yewei-return).
    2. With the passive participial endings -ak‘, ~k‘v:
       wasecgi‘k'” wherewith it is shot (from sa%g- shoot)
        me’xak‘” having father (from ma’za his father)
        wa‘-i-daxzik'’dek’ my gathered ones (= I have been gathering
           them) (from d6%z- gather)
       dal*-wa-p‘ti' tlik'” mixed with (from p‘dt!- mix) 178.5
     3. In some verbs that have the peculiar intransitive-forming suffix
 -z-, by no means in all:
         geyewa'lade® I eat (136.15) (cf. gayawa’én I eat it 30.11)
        _le*ba‘na he carries 178.6 (stem 1a%b-)
                                                                      . $31
60                     BUREAU     OF AMERICAN   ETHNOLOGY             [putt40       dida*t'be’ *k't'bag-ams (= -amtz) they had their hair tied on sides
          of head (from base ¢'bd%g-) 142.17; cf. -t‘ba’*gamda‘n I tie his
         hair (27.1)
No satisfactory reason can be given why most verbs in -z- do not show
this ‘stem-palatalization. It is quite possible that its occurrence is |
confined to a restricted number of such verbs; at any rate, there is |
some limitation in its employment, which the material at hand has
not been found extensive enough to define.
   4. In nouns ending in -z-ap‘ (-s-ap‘= -t-1-ap'), probably derived
from such verbs in -z- as were referred to under 3:
       ra*le’‘sap* belt (cf. xa2la’¢da‘n I put it about my waist)
       hali’“x6p‘ (= -xap‘) shirt (cf. halo’/“*k‘ she put on[her dress])
   5. In verbs provided with the suffix -ra-, which serves to relieve
transitive verbs of the necessity of expressing the object:           |
       li! *ewagwadinin (= lik!-xa-) Vl trap for him (stem 1dk/¥-)
       ili’ pragwank* she shall pound with (stone pestle) (cf. lobo‘p* she |
           pounds them)
       kledeixade® I was out picking (cf. k/ada‘n I pick them, k/adat he
           picks them)
       ts leye’maade® I hide things (cf. ts!ayama’‘n I hide it)
     6. In reflexive verbs ending in -gwi- or -k‘wa- (-gwa-):
       klet‘gwi‘p’ pick them for yourself! (stem k/ad-)
       alts!eyzk‘wit' he washed himself with it (cf. alis/ay@p‘ he washed
         his own face)
      ' detslek‘urde® I touch myself (cf. ilats!agi’'n I touch him)
        kledétk‘wa‘n I pick them for myself (aorist stem k/adai-)
       alnii’“k'wa he painted his own face (stem nd“gw-)
Yet many,      perhaps    most,    reflexive verbs fail to show   the palatal
ablaut:
       plagénk‘wit' he bathed himself
       t‘gwa*xa’nt'gwide® I shall tattoo myself      (but la’“gwant'gwide' |
         trap deer for myself)                                                  |
       2a?-sg0'“t'gwide® I cut myself
       igaxaga’xgwa'n I scratch myself                                          |
We have here the same difficulty as in 3. Evidently some factor or |
factors enter into the use of the ablaut that it has not been founp
possible to determine.                                              |
   7. Other cases undoubtedly occur, but there are not enough of |
them in the material gathered to allow of the setting up of further |
groups. All that can be done with those cases that do not fall

3048]          HANDBOOK    OF   INDIAN   LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                 61within the first six groups is to list them as miscellaneous cases.
Such are:
     gwel-letsdet I shall be lame (cf. gwel-la’is klemna’n I shall make
           him lame
        le*psi‘ wing (if derived, as seems probable, from stem lé*b- carry)
        tlemeya’nwia“ people     go along to see her married 178.1      (cf.
       tamayana’'n I take her somewheres to get her married [148.5])
  Palatal ablaut, it should be noted, does not affect the -a- of the
second member of reduplicated verbs:
        t‘galt‘ga'l it bounced from her 140.8
        t‘geltg‘a’/Isi it bounced from me
The connecting vowel, however, of verbs reduplicated according to
the third type always follows the stem-vowel:
    dak‘da-hele’ halzade§ I am accustomed to answer (stem -2a@4I-)
   It is difficult to find a very tangible psychic connection between the
various cases that require the use of the palatal ablaut, nor is there
the slightest indication that a phonetic cause lies at the bottom of
 the phenomenon.     If we disregard the first group of cases, we shall
 find that they have this in common, they are all or nearly all intransi-
 tives derived from transitives by means of certain voice-forming ele-
 ments (-z-, -xa-, -gwi-, -k‘wa-), or else nominal passives or derivatives
 of such intransitives (-ak'”, -<-ap'); -k‘wa-, it is true, takes transi-
 tive pronominal forms; but it is logically intransitive in character
 in that it indicates action in reference to something belonging to the
 subject. The only trait that can be found in common to the first
 group and the remaining is that the action may be looked upon as:
 self-centered; just as, e. g., a form in -za- denotes that the (logically)
 transitive action is not conceived of as directed toward some definite
 outside object, but is held within the sphere of the person of central
 interest (the subject), so, also, in a form with incorporated first per-
 son singular object, the action may be readily conceived of as taking
  place within the sphere of the person of central interest from the
  point of view of the speaker. No difficulty will be found in making
  this interpretation fit the other cases, though it is not conversely true
  that all forms implying self-centered action undergo palatalization.
  The explanation offered may be considered too vague to be con-
  vincing; but no better can be offered. In any event, the palatal
  ablaut will be explained as the symbolic expression of some general
  mental attitude rather than of a clear-cut grammatical concept.
                                                                    § 31

vowels, there are a number of cases of words showing differing vowels,
but whose genetic relationship seems evident.               These vocalic varis-
tions have not been brought into the form of a rule; the number of
examples is small and the process apparently touches rather the
lexical material than the morphology.               Variations of this character
between a and ¢ are:
      gala-b-a''n I twist it; p!it-wa-gele-g-a’'n I drill for fire with it

      zuma‘ food 54.4; xiimii’k‘def I am sated (130.18)
An a—ii variation is seen in:

            33.16
Variations between a and 7 are:

      laba’n I shall carry it (124.5); libin news (what is carried about
         from mouth to mouth[?]) 194.9
Of o (u)—e variations there have been found:
      lohott‘e® I die 184.18; lehett‘e® I drift dead ashore (75.5)
      2*-huk!u/hak'na‘n I breathe; 2a°-hege’hak‘na‘n I breathe (79.2)

An e—+ variation is found in the probably related:

plays a rather important part in the tense-formation (aorist and non-
aorist) of many verbs.      The variation is in every case one betweel
fortis and non-fortis; i. e., between p/, t!, k!, ts!, and b, d, g, s, respec-
tively.      Three main types of grammatical consonant change are to
be recognized:
     § 32
Boas]          HANDBOOK     OF INDIAN          LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                  63   1. An initial fortis in the aorist as opposed to an initial media in
non-aorist forms:
        aorist k/olol- (stem go*l- dig)
        aorist t/ebe- (stem de*b- arise)
        aorist t/ayag- (stem da*g- find)
  2. A medial fortis followed by a vowel in the aorist as opposed to
a medial tenuis followed by a consonant in non-aorist forms:
        aorist lop/od- (stem lop‘d- rain, snow, or hail)
        aorist lats/ag- (stem lasg- touch)
  3. A medial media in the aorist as opposed to a medial fortis in
the remaining forms:
        aorist ni“d- (stem nié“t/- drown)
        aorist witg- (stem wik!- spread)
Needless to say, this consonant-ablaut has absolutely nothing to do
with the various mechanical consonant-changes dealt with in the
phonology.
   A few examples of consonant-ablaut not connected with regular
grammatical changes have also been found:
        s‘omod- boil; ts‘ /iimii*mt‘a- boil
        hau-gwen-yut 'uyad-i- swallow down greedily (like duck or hog)
           126.10; hau-gwen-yunu‘yan-i- dit.
The second example illustrates an interchange not of fortis and non-
fortis (for n£ is related to 7 as is t! to d), but of non-nasal stop and
nasal.     —

                             § 33.     Introductory   The verb is by far the most important part of the Takelma sen-
tence, and as such it will be treated before the independent pronoun,
houn, or adjective.        A general idea of the make-up of the typical
verb-form will have been gained from the general remarks on mor-
phology ; nevertheless the following formula will be found useful by
way of restatement:
   Loosely     attached    prefixes + verb-stem            (or aorist stem   derived
from verb-stem)       + derivational       suffixes + formal      elements   (chiefly
pronominal)       + syntactic element.
   This skeleton will at the same time serve to suggest an order of

best to get an idea of the main body or core of the word to whiel
these relational elements are attached. The prefixes, though not
entering into the vital grammatical structure of the verb, are impor-
tant for the part they play in giving the whole verb-form its exact
material content.         They may, therefore, with advantage be taken up
first.                   °
                       1. Verbal Prefixes        (§ § 34-38)                            § 84. GENERAL       REMARKS   Verbal prefixes may be classified into four groups when regard is
mainly had to their function as determined largely by position with
respect to other prefixes: incorporated objects, adverbial (including
local)     elements,    incorporated   instrumentals,     and   connective    and
modal particles. These various prefixes are simply strung along as
particles in the same order in which they have been listed. Inasmuch
as the exact function of a prefix is to a considerable extent determined
by its position, it follows that the same prefix, phonetically speaking,
may appear with slightly variant meanings according as it is to be
interpreted as an object, local element, or instrument.  Thus the
prefix 7- always has reference to the hand or to both hands; but the
exact nature of the reference depends partly on the form of the verb
and partly on the position of the prefix itself, so that 7- may be trans-
lated, according to the circumstances of the case, as
HAND(s):
     i-pli'-no'""k'watn I warm my hands
WITH THE HAND:
         7-£0""dini''n I hunt for it with the hand (= I am feeling around
       for it)
IN THE HAND:
         p'im-i-ho""gwagwa’'n I run with salmon in my hand
   In the first of these three examples the 7- as object precedes the
incorporated instrumental p/i FIRE, so that the form means literally
I WARM MY HANDS WITH FIRE. In the third form the 7 as local ele
ment follows the incorporated object p‘tm saLMon. Such a triplicete
use is found only in the case of incorporated nouns, particularly such
as refer to parts of the body. These incorporated elements are to
be kept distinct from certain other elements that are used in aD

The line between these two sets of prefixes is, however, difficult to
draw when it comes to considering the place to be assigned to some
of the prefixed elements. It is doubtful whether we are fully justified
in making absolutely strict distinctions between the various uses of
the body-part prefixes; at any rate, it is certainly preferable, from a
native point of view, to translate the three examples of i- incorpora-
tion given above as:
        I-hand-fire-warm         (-as-regards-myself)
     T-hand-hunt-for-it
     T-salmon-hand-run-with
leaving in each case the exact delimitation in meaning of the element
HAND to be gathered from the general nature of the form. The fol-
lowing examples will render the matter of position and function of the
various prefixes somewhat clearer:    Object.       Locative      | Instrument.              Modal.                     Verb proper. bém- sticks   wa- together     | 4- hand                                   tlozo’zitn I     gather (them) (=I

follows that which is primarily adverbial in character; thus:
      ba-ide'‘didi’niklat‘ did you stretch it out? (=ba--out +de-lip,
         in front + di interrogative particle + di’ntk!at‘ you stretched it)
In general it may be said that instances of a body-part prefix pre-
ceding a primarily adverbial element (like ba-i-, ba°-, he*‘-, and others)
are rare or entirely lacking.
   From what has been said it might seem 1 that the connective and
modal elements (like yaza,mi’“wa, and di) are more closely associated
with the verb form than are the other elements, yet this is only
apparently the case. Properly speaking all these modal elements are
post-positives that normally attach themselves to the first word of
        3045°—Bull. 40, pt 2—12—5                                                                    § 34
66                 BUREAU      OF AMERICAN          ETHNOLOGY               [BULL.40the sentence, no matter what part the word plays in the sentence.
Thus in a form like me’*-di-giniga‘t‘ DID YoU COME? (= me‘- HITHER +
di- interrogative particle + giniga‘t’ You WENT TO), the modal (inter-
rogative) element di regularly stands nearest the verb; but as soon as
another word is introduced before the verb, the interrogative particle
shoves back a step, and we have a form of sentence like, e. g., hoida’'s
di me’‘giniga‘t’ DID YOU COME AS SINGER, i. e., TO sinc? From this
it becomes fairly evident that the di in the first example is not prop-
erly a verbal prefix at all, but merely a post-positive particle depend-
ing upon the preceding me’‘, in the same way that, in the second
example, it depends upon the noun hoida’‘s stncER. This inference
is clinched by a form like giniga’t‘tdi pi» you ao (SOMEWHERE)!
for here the di is evidently an enclitic element, not a prefix.
   In sharp contradistinction to such movability, the body-part and
adverbial prefixes occupy rigidly fixed positions before the verb;
they therefore belong to a class quite distinct from the modal parti-
cles. These latter are verbal prefixes only in so far as their post-
positive    tendency    may    force   them    to    become     embedded     in the.
verb-complex, in which case they seem to cut loose the incorporated
object, adverbial prefix, and instrumental element from the verb.
Diagrammatically the last form tabulated may be represented by
za-i- [mi’*wa] -sgi’*bi'n.      We may then dismiss the modal elements
from our consideration of verbal prefixes, to return to them when
speaking of connective and adverbial particles.
                       § 35. INCORPORATED           NOUNS     It may seem strange at first sight to interpret in the examples
given above such elements as bém sTIOKS, gw&n ROAD, and da‘n ROCKS
as incorporated objects, when they occur as absolute nouns in that
form    as well, though       a faint suggestion of incorporation          is given
by gwan-ha-yaza-t!iiliilga’*n 1 KEEP FOLLOWING THE TRAIL, in that
the modal post-positive yaza follows not gwan, but rather ha-, a8
though the direct object were not quite felt to be an element inde
pendent of the verb. Without laying particular stress on this latter
point, there are, it would seem, good reasons for considering the
nouns referred to as incorporated,            though in any event the incor-
poration must be called a loose one, and not at all comparable with
the Iroquois usage.
     § 35
BOAs)         HANDBOOK        OF   INDIAN     LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                67    1. In the first place it is evident from such examples as 7-p/i'-
no'*k‘wa'n 1 WARM MY HANDS and han-waya-swilswa'lhi HE TORE HIM
OPEN WITH A KNIFE, that nouns (in these cases p/i‘ FIRE and waya
KNIFE) occur as incorporated instrumentals, for such elements as 7-
and han- can not possibly be isolated from the verb (han- does not
occur as independent adverb, but only as prefix; 7- is inconceivable
as independent noun); furthermore, if, in the forms just quoted, p/i
and waya be looked upon as absolutely independent nouns, they lose
all semblance of grammatical form, there being, indeed, nothing but a
definite position in a verb-complex that could here suggest the notion
of instrumentality.      It is also possible to isolate waya, but that
would involve considerable             readjustment of the verbal structure.
To be stamped as an instrumental, waya must in that case be fol-
lowed by a postposition wa wiTH, so that the sentence then reads,
han-swilswa'Thi wa’ya wa‘ (the phrase wa’ya wa‘ may also precede).
  If we wish to incorporate the instrumental idea into the verb, and
yet keep the noun outside of the verb-structure, we may let the wa,
which seems properly to denote wiTH IT, occupy the place of the incor-
porated waya, which, as an appositive of wa, then either precedes or
follows the verb-form, wa’ya han-wa-swilswa’thi, or han-wa-swilswa’lhi
waya* HE-ACROSS-WITH-IT-TORE-HIM (it, i. 6.), THE-KNIFE.     This con-
struction is identical with the well-known appositional structure of
Nahua or Chinook (e. g., I-IT-KILLED THE-DOG), except that the incor-
porated element is here instrumental and not objective in character.
The noun and its representative can not both be incorporated in the ©
verb, such a form as han-waya-wa-swilswa'lhi, for instance, being
quite impossible.
  It becomes         clear, therefore,      that   an incorporated   instrumental
noun like wa’ya is quite analogous                  to an instrumental body-
part prefix like + HAND, with the                   difference that wa’ya may
be isolated     in     that    form,     while     7+ must,   when   isolated, be
provided with a possessive pronominal element.                  The form han~-
swilswa’Thi   1 TORE HIM OPEN WITH MY HAND is strictly analogous to
han-waya-swilswa'Thi; the sentence tiade‘k* han-wa-swilswa'thi MyY-
HAND I-ACROSS-WITH-IT-TORE-HIM corresponds to wa’ya han-wa-swil-
swa'Thi; and, finally, han-swilswa’Thi Wiede’k* wa‘ 1-ACROSS-TORE-HIM               ~
MY-HAND WITH (-1T) is parallel to han-swilswa’Thi wa’ya wa‘.               What-
ever is true morphologically of 7- must be true of wa’ya; the evident
                                                                           § 35

form.
   As the incorporation of the noun as an instrument seems a rather
important trait of Takelma, a number of further examples may be
given:

        da*-he*l-yebebi''n I sing for him, literally, I engage (%) his ears

           (dauya’*k'“da his shaman-spirit, apart from verb-structure);
            cf, 164,14
All these, except the last, begin with elements (2a?-, he*-, gwen-, da*,
di‘-, de) that can not be isolated from the verb.
   Instrumentals, whether nouns or body-part. prefixes, can occur
only in transitive verbs. The forms nozwa‘ yana-wa-lobobi''n |
POUND        ACORNS        WITH   A PESTLE         and norwa*‘i-lobozagwa’'n         1 POUND
WITH A PESTLE, as compared with 10b0’xade* 1 POUND, will serve to
illustrate this. The first sentence reads, when literally translated,
PESTLE          (noxwa‘)     1-ACORNS          (yana‘)   -wiITH-IT-PoUND.      The     logical
instrument (noxwa‘) stands outside the verb-complex and is in
apposition with its incorporated instrumental representative (wc),
yana‘       being the direct (incorporated)               object.   The     form lobo’zadé
I POUND is made intransitive by the element -ca- (hence the change
in pronominal            form     from        transitive -'n to intransitive     -de*), and
allows of no instrumental modification; a form like 7-lobo’xade* could
hardly mean I POUND WITH THE HAND; at most it could signify
I POUND IN THE HAND. If we wish, however, to express the logical
instrument in some manner, and yet neglect to specify the object, we
must get around the difficulty by making a secondary transitive of
        § 35
boas]          HANDBOOK      OF INDIAN      LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                      69the intransitive in -za-. This is done by the suffixed element -gw-
HAVING, ATTENDED By. The grammatical object of a transitive verb
in -gw- is never the logical object of the action, but always dependent
upon the comitative idea introduced by this suffix. Hence the sec-
ond form is not provided with a true instrumental (wITH A PESTLE),
but takes the logical instrument (nozwa‘) as a direct object, while
the 7- is best rendered by IN THE HAND; to translate literally, the
form really means I POUND HAVING A PESTLE IN THE HAND.
      It sometimes happens that a verb form has two instrumentals,
one, generally 1- WITH           THE   HAND,      expressing indefinite or remote
instrumentality, the second, a noun or demonstrative, expressing the
actual instrument by means of which the action is accomplished. In
such cases the second instrument is expressed outside of the verb-
complex, but may be represented in the verb by the incorporated wa
WITH IT following the first instrumental element (7-). Examples of
such double instrumentals are:
    gwalt’ bé*-%i-wa-x5'""t't wind he-up-hand-with-it-caused-them-to-
       fall, i. e., he caused them to fall by means of a wind (that he
       made go up) 168.2
        ga ‘i-wa-molo*ma’lhi that she-hand-with-it-stirs-it-up,            i. e., she
          stirs it up with that (incidentally, of course, she uses her hand
          too) 170.16
        dan (object) k/ama       (instr.) plai-“t-wa-sga'ek sgigi'n rocks tongs
          down-hand-with-it-pick-up, i. e., I pick up the rocks with the
          tongs (and put them) down
   2. The noun as instrument has been shown to act in a manner
entirely analogous to the instrumental body-part prefix. The latter
can, without phonetic change, become the direct object of the verb
by occupying the proper position:
        s*in-A-lats lagi’ ‘n I touched     his nose with my       hand (s‘in- nose)
but, theoretically at least,
     7-s'in-lats !agi’*«n I touched his hand with my nose
If we bear in mind that such elements as s‘in- and 7- are really nothing
but nouns in their stem form (with possessive pronoun: s‘in-t-2-da
HIS     NOSE; 7’-ii-z-da   HIS    HAND),    the     parallelism   with   such   noun-
objects as bém and gwan (see examples on p. 65) becomes complete.
The fact that they may occur independently, while sin- and 7-
never do, is really irrelevant to the argument, as a body-part noun
must necessarily be associated with some definite person. Entirely
                                                                                § 35
70                      BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY                   {But.4
analogous to the nominal elements -i«2z- and -i-z- of s‘inizda and
Viada is, e. g., the -am- of gwa*l-a'm-tk* my Roap. Just as they
drop off when the body-part nouns are incorporated, whether as
object or instrument, into the verb, so, also, the -am- of gwa®l-am-
(=gw4a*n-an-) drops off when the noun is used without pronominal
or prepositional modification. That the -am- has nothing per se to
do with the pronominal affix, but is really a. noun-forming element
added to the stem, is proven by forms like ha-gwa*la‘m IN THE ROAD.
Thus:
       object bem, in b¢m-wa‘-t-tloro'xi*n I gather sticks, is related to
       object s‘in-, in sin--lats/agi’*n I touch his nose, as
       instrument bém, in 24*-be’m-k!wo""t'k!widi'n I broke it with
         stick, to
       instrument s‘in-, in s‘in-tlayagi’‘n I find it with my nose (=I
            smell it)
In view of the complete parallelism of noun and body-part element
and the transparent incorporation of the noun as instrument, nothing
remains but to look upon the simple noun without pronominal
affixes, when placed immediately before the local and instrumental
prefixes of the verb, as itself a loosely incorporated object. Examn-
ples of noun-objects in such form and position are to be found in
great number; in fact, the regularity with which the object is put
before the verb, as contrasted with the freely movable subject, argues
further for the close relation of the noun-object to the verb.
  A few further examples of incorporated noun-objects are given by
way of illustration:
       he‘l-gel-gulugwa’‘n I desire to sing (literally, I-song-breast-desire;
         hel song)
       he‘l-yununa’n I sing a song (106.7)

form be at all idiomatic; in some (as in he‘l-gel-gulugwa’*n and wai-
s-iigii's-tixgwa‘n) it would be quite inconceivable. The incorporation
must be considered particularly strong in those cases in which the
object is what might be called a root-noun identical in form with a
verb-stem of corresponding significance:
     wat' sleep, to sleep
     he‘l- song, to sing
     se‘l- black paint, to paint
likewise where the object gives special color to the verb, deter-
mining the concrete significance                     of the form, as in zuma-klemna’‘s
and wili-wa-7-t!a’nida‘.
   3. Besides being used as instrumentals and direct objects, a few
incorporated nouns are found employed in set phrases, apparently as
subjects.       Such are:
        ba*-be*-k yi’tk‘da® forenoon (literally, up-sun-going, or when-it-
           goes) (6a%- is never used as independent adverb, so that be*-

           law + wo‘k‘, probably identical with wdk‘ he arrived) 17.13, in
          which mot’- must be considered an integral part of the verb,
          because unprovided with pronominal affix (cf. mo’t'é* his son-
          in-law), and, further, because the whole form may be accom-
        panied by a non-incorporated subject (e. g., bo’mazi mot'wo'k'
        Otter visited his wife’s parents, literally, something like: Otter
        son-in-law-arrived)
   4. Several verb-forms seem to show an incorporated noun forming
a local phrase with an immediately preceding local prefix; in such
cases the whole phrase must be considered an incorporated unit, its
lack of independence being evidenced either by the fact that
it is itself preceded by a non-independent verbal prefix, or else differs
in phonetic form from the corresponding independent local phrase.
Examples are:
      da?-ts: lelei-sgalawi’'n I looked at them out of the corners of my
         eyes (literally, I-alongside-eye-looked-at-them)’; cf. da@*-ts-!e-
         leidz alongside my eyes
  1wai- indeed could not be obtained as an     independent noun, its exist   as substantive being inferred
from forms such as that cited above.    .
   2It may be, however, that this form is to be interpreted as I-ASIDE- (WITH-THE-) EYE-LOOKED-AT-THEM,
ts’ /elei- being in that case an incorporated instrumental noun.                               § 35
72                    BUREAU     OF AMERICAN    ETHNOLOGY              (BULL.40      ha-t'ga°-gwidi‘k'” he threw it into the open (literally, he-in-earth-
         threw-it) ; cf. ha-t‘g@a@ in the earth
      ba-t-dak‘-wili-t!a*di/*n I ran out of the house (6a-i- out, adverbial
            prefix + dak‘- on top of + wilt house) 24.13; cf. dak‘-wilt on
            top of the house
     ha-yau-t'ge’nets!a'n I put it about my waist (literally, I-in
       [under ?]-rib-put-it-about) ; cf. ha~yawad2 inside my ribs
Such verbs with incorporated local phrases are naturally not to be con-
fused with cases in which a local prefix is followed by an incorporated
(instrumental) noun with which it is not, however, directly connected.
Thus the ha- of ha-tga%-gwidi‘k’” is not directly comparable            to the
ha- of a form like:
     ha-p!i#-ts' !ii'liik itn I set it on fire (p/i* with fire) 73.9
Here ha-p/i'- cannot be rendered IN THE FIRE.
   Some verb-forms show an evidently incorporated noun that has so
thoroughly amalgamated with the stem that it is difficult to make
out its exact share in the building up of the material content of the
verb. For example:
      s-omlohoya’lda‘n I doctor him as s-omloho’lza‘s
doubtless contains the, incorporated noun s‘off% MOUNTAIN;             but the
implied allusion is not at all evident, except in so far as the protecting
spirits of the s-omloho’lza‘s are largely mountain-spirits. The verb
itself is probably a derivative of the verb-stem loho- DIE (aorist
lohoi-).
                          §36.   BODY-PART     PREFIXES   Having disposed of the modal prefixes, which on analysis turned
out to be verbal prefixes only in appearance, and of incorporated
nouns, which one would hardly be inclined to term prefixes in the
narrower sense of the term, there remain for our consideration two
important sets of genuine prefixes, body-part elements and adverbial,
chiefly local, prefixes. The former will be taken up first. By “‘ body-
part prefix” is not meant any body-part noun in its incorporated form
(many of these, such as ¢s:/elei- EYE, t/iba- PANCREAS, not differing
morphologically from ordinary incorporated nouns), but only certain
etymologically important monosyllabic elements that are used to indi-
cate in a more general way what body-part is concerned in a particular
action, and which may be regarded as in some degree verbal classifiers.
With the exception of 7- HAND and s-in- NosE, classed with the rest

because of their very extended use, they differ fundamentally from
other body-part nouns in that they have, besides their literal, also a
more formal, local value; in this capacity they are regularly employed,
also, as the first element of noun and pronoun local phrases, and, some
of them, as the second element of local postpositions. In the fol-
lowing list the second column gives the literal body-part significance;
the third, the generalized local meaning; the fourth, the correspond-
ing independent noun (in a few cases, it will be observed, there is no
such corresponding noun);                          and the fifth column, an example of a.
local phrase:

       The last two are evidently compounded;                                      the first of di‘- aBovE
    and al- EYE, FACE, the second of gwen-NECcK and probably adverbial
 prefix ha-u- UNDER. The noun hau-z- WOMAN’S PRIVATE PARTS may
 possibly be connected with this prefix ha-u-, though, in view of the
 fact that ha- appears as the incorporated form of the noun, it seems
 more probable that the resemblance in form and meaning is acci-
    dental.      It is possible that other rarer body-part prefixes occur, but
    those listed are all that have been found.
       In not a few cases, where the body-part prefix evidently has neither
    objective nor instrumental meaning, it may yet be difficult to see a
    clearly local idea involved.                   This is apt to be the case particularly
                                                                                                                 § 36
74                   BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY                         [poue. 40
with many intransitive verbs, in which the share of meaning con-
tributed by the body-part prefix is apparent enough but where the
logical (syntactic) relation of its content to that of the verb proper is
hardly capable of precise definition. Thus, from yowo’* HE Is are
formed by means of body-part prefixes:
      al-fyowo'* he-eye-is, i. e., he looks 62.6
      da*-‘yowo’* he-ear-is, i. e., he listens, pays attention 96.9
      ba*-gel-‘yowo’* he-up-breast-is, i. e., he lies belly up 140.5
In these cases it is obviously impossible, yowo- being an intransitive
 verb not implying activity, to translate al-, da*-, and gel- as instru-
mentals (WITH THE EYE, EAR, BREAST); nor is there any clear idea of
location expressed, though such translations as AT THE EYE, EAR,
BREAST would perhaps not be too far fetched. In many verbs the
body-part prefix has hardly any recognizable meaning, but seems
necessary for idiomatic reasons. In & few cases prefixes seem to
interchange without perceptible change of meaning, e. g., al- and
dak* in:
     aldémzigam we shall assemble (186.7)
       dak‘d@maia“t‘ people (indef.) will assemble (136.11)
     Where two body-part prefixes occur in a verb form, they may
either both retain their original concrete significance, the first prefix
being generally construed as object, the second as instrument (e. g.,
s‘al-%i-lats!agi’*n 1-FOOT-HAND-TOUCH-HIM, i. @., 1 TOUCH HIS FOOT WITH
MY HAND); or the first prefix may have its secondary local signifi-
cance, while the second is instrumental in force (e. g., de-""i-wi'*gi'n
I-FRONT-HAND-SPREAD-IT, i. @., I SPREAD IT OUT); or both prefixes
may have secondary local or indefinite significance (e. g., gwel-ge'l-
‘yowo'      HE-LEG-BREAST-IS,   i. e., HE   FACES   AWAY   FROM   HIM);     rarely
do we find that two body-part prefixes are concrete in significance and
absolutely coordinated at the same time (see footnote to 12 below).
   To illustrate the various uses of the body-part prefixes it seems
preferable to cite examples under each separate prefix rather than to
group them under such morphologic headings as objective, instru-
mental, and local, as by the former method the range of usage taken
up by the various prefixes is more clearly demonstrated. The
examples are in each case divided into two groups: (a) literal signifi-
cation (objective, instrumental, or local) and (6) general adverbial
(local) signification.

          dak‘hene*da’‘n I wait for him
   The last three or four examples can hardly be said to show a
       transparent use of dak‘-. Evidently the meaning of the prefix
       has become merged in the general verbal content, becoming
          unrecognizable as such; cf. UNDER      in English     UNDERSTAND,
          UNDERGO.
2. da-, de-
   It seems possible that we have here two distinct prefixes to begin
        with, da- INSIDE oF MoUTH (cf. dats/ay@p*‘ HE WASHED HIS
        MOUTH) and de- Lies (cf. de%s/ayap‘ HE WASHED HIs Lips and
          noun de*-z- Lips), from the second of which         developed    the
          general local significance of IN FRONT; contrast also hada’t'-
          gwa IN HIS OWN MOUTH with déf‘gwa in front of himself. The
          strict delimitation of the two, however,    is made    difficult by
          the fact that da-, alone in this respect among non-radical
          verbal elements, undergoes palatal ablaut (thus becoming de-)
          whenever the stem shows a palatal vowel, whether primary
          or itself due   to ablaut; observe also the stem-change         from

        No body-part prefix, except perhaps al-, is used with such fre-
          quency as 7-, the scrupulousness with which verbs implying
          action with the hand incorporate it seeming at times almost
          pedantic. Only a small selection out of the great number of
              occurrences need here be given:

8. dii-
       (a) BACK:
       The local uses of 2@*- and di‘- (IN MIDDLE, BETWEEN, and ABOVE,
          respectively) would indicate that, in their more literal signif-
          cation, they refer respectively to the LOWER BACK about the
          waist and the UPPER BACK, though no direct information
          was obtained of the distinction.
               di'ts!ayap* he washed himself in back of body
               di‘ha@z his back is burning

                 under da@-) (140.11;    142.17)
               di'*algelegala’mda*n I tie his hair up into top-knot (172.2)
               dituyu’ts!amdatn I fool him (aorist uyuts!- laugh)

              di‘més (earth) is lit up (78.1)
              dithilifgwa’'n I am glad 22.2
       di‘- is used in quite a number of verbs of mashing or squeezing,
          the primary idea being probably that of pressing down on top
          of something:
              di'p'ili’p'ilitn I squash (yellow-jackets) (74.3); contrast
                 gel-bem-p‘il’ p‘itn I whip him on his breast (literally,
                 I-breast-stick-whip-him)    (cf. 76.1, 2, 3)
              dit/yt‘st’*n I mash them
              ba-idigwibi’‘k‘wap* it popped all around 27.14
              di't‘gumu’t‘gimitn I squeezed and cracked many insects (such
              as fleas)
       In many cases, as in some of the forms given above, the primary
            signification of dt‘- is greatly obscured. It is not at all certain
            but that we are at times (as in di*wyu’ts!amda‘n) dealing really
            with the phonetically similar prefix df*- REAR.

          the primary meaning, at least in English translation, of di‘-

          number of cases it seems to involve the idea of sight, not infre-
          quently       adding that     concept   to a form which does not in
          itself convey      any such     implication.     In most   of   the verb-
          forms, however, many of which have already been given
          under other prefixes, the al- seems to have no definitely ascer- .
          tainable signification at all. In some cases it may be consid-
          ered merely as an empty element serving as a support for a
          post-positive modal particle. For example:
        al-his-gulugwa’'n I am desirous of something
              where his TRYING can not oceupy an initial position
        al-di-yok!oya‘t’ did you know him?
          Here alyok/oya‘t’ in itself hardly differs in content from
          yokloya‘t' YoU KNEW HIM. The most satisfactory definition
                                                                            § 36
84                     BUREAU    OF AMERICAN      ETHNOLOGY                [BULL40            that can be given of al- in its more general and indefinite
            use is that it conveys the idea of motion out from the sphere
            of the person concerned, whether the motion be directed
            toward some definite goal (object) or not; an approximate
            translation in such cases would be to, at.           The correctness
         of this interpretation is borne out by the fact that al- at
        ‘times replaces a more definite local phrase, as though it were
            a substitute for it, of the same general formal          but weaker
            material content.
       wa*da lo“gwa’'n to-him I-thrust-it, where wa%da             definitely ex-
       presses a local pronominal idea To, aT HIM.
Compare:
    alld’“guitn I stretched it out to him
             where the exact local definition of the action is not so clearly
             expressed; the direct object of the verb being here not the
             object thrust, but the person aimed at, while the indirectnes
             of the action is interpreted by means of al- as an adverbial or
             local modification of the verbal content. The change of vowel
             in the ending, a—i, is closely connected, as we shall later see,
             with this change of ‘‘face’”’ in the verb. The first form may
             be literally translated as TO-HIM    I-IT-THRUST; the second,as
             I-HIM-TO-THRUST (IT). Similarly, in al*iats/agi’*n 1 TOUCHED
             HIS BODY, the al- is probably best considered as a general
             directive prefix replacing the more special prefixes (such as
             sal-, sin-, and so on) that indicate the particular part of the
             body affected, or, as one might put it, the exact limit of
            ‘motion. The use of al- in local phrases shows clearly its
             general local significance: als-6“ma‘l aT, TO THE MOUNTALS;
            ga‘a‘l TO THAT, as postposition equivalent to TO, FOR, FROM.

        It is at least possible, if not very probable, that al- To, aT, and

           preceding examples have incidentally illustrated the local use
           of al-, only a few more need be given:

  It will have been noticed that several of the body-part prefixes
have developed special uses that almost entitle them, at times, to
being considered verbal in function. Thus 2@*- BACK, BETWEEN has
been seen to develop, from its latter local use, the more strictly verbal
one of cutting, splitting, breaking, or rending in two; the ideas of
BETWEEN and of DIVISION IN Two are naturally closely associated.
The specialized semiverbal uses of some of the prefixes may be thus
listed :
     da-, de- activity in reference to fire (burn, set on fire, glow)
        2a*- rend in two (cut, split, break)
        di‘- crushing activity (mash, squeeze)
        di*- fell, erect (long object)
        ha- dress, undress
                                                                          § 36.

The resemblance between this use of the Takelma body-part prefixes
and the Siouan use of verb prefixes denoting instrumental activities
(e. g., Ponka ba- BY PRESSING WITH THE HAND, md- BY CUTTING, ¢0-
WITH THE MOUTH, BY BLOWING) is not far to seek, although in Takelm
the development seems most plausibly explained from the local, rather
than the instrumental, force of the prefixes. Neither the employment
of Takelma body-part nor of Siouan instrumental prefixes with verb
stems is in any morphologic respect comparable to the peculiar com-
position of initial and second-position verb stems characteristic of
Algonkin and Yana. The same general psychic tendency toward
the logical analysis of an apparently simple activity into its com
ponent elements, however, seems evident in the former as well asin
the latter languages.
                                     § 37. LOCAL        PREFIXES     The purely local prefixes, those that are not in any way associated
with parts of the body, are to be divided into two groups:
    (1) Such as are used also in the formation of noun and pronow
local phrases or of postpositions, these being in that regard closely
allied to the body-part prefixes in their more general local use; an
     (2)      Such as are employed strictly as verbal prefixes, and are ince
pable of entering into combination with denominating elements. Tht
following table gives all the common prefixes of both groups, example
of noun or pronoun local phrases being added in the last column:

second. The position of ha*- and me‘- is somewhat doubtful; but
the fairly evident etymological connection of the former with haya
and the correlative relation in form and meaning between me‘- and
he*-, make it probable that they are to be classed with the first
group. While some of these prefixes (such as dal- and han-) are
inconceivable as separate adverbial elements, others (particularly
aba-i, which is apparently composed of demonstrative element a-
THIs + ba-i) are on the border-land between true prefix and inde-
pendent adverb.       me*- and he*-, though they are never used alone,
stand in close etymological relation to a number of local adverbs
(such as eme® HERE and ge THERE), which also, though not so rigidly
as to justify their being termed prefixes, tend to stand before the
verb. The difference between local prefix and adverb is one of
degree rather than of fundamental morphologic traits; in any case,
it is rather artificial to draw the line between me*- in such forms as
meyéa COME BACK! and ge in, e. g., ge ‘yowo'* THERE IT 1s. Sometimes,
though not frequently, two local prefixes, neither of them a body-part
element, occur in a single verb form. See, e. g., p/ai-hau- under 2

either to the body-part or the purely local group. Strictly speaking
it should be considered the incorporated form of the demonstrative
pronoun in its instrumental function. As was seen above, it may
represent an instrumental noun, but, while the noun may itself be
incorporated to denote the instrument, this is not the case with the
demonstrative pronoun.                   For example:
         ga wede yap!a-wa-dimhiga‘ that not I-people-with-shall-kill (=I
           shall not kill people therewith)
In other words, it would seem likely that such a form as ga al‘wa-
ts!ayagi/'n 1 WASH HIM WITH THAT is related to an al‘wats!/ayagi’*n
I WASH HIM WITH IT 48s, e. g., 27 al'wats!ayagi’*n 1 WASH HIM WITH
WATER, to the form alzits!ayagi’'n I WATER-WASH HIM, i. e., the wa-
in al‘wats!ayagi’'n is to be regarded as an incorporated ga THAT, IT
(such forms as *algats/ayagi’*n have never been found to occur). It
will be noticed that the verb-forms with incorporated wa- are nor-
mally characterized by a suffixed -i- or -hi-; as soon, however, as the
verb loses its instrumental “‘face,’’ this -i- is replaced by the normal
-a-. Thus:                                                              .

          rated wa-, wila‘u ARROW being outside the verb-structure and
           in apposition with wa-)
but:
     ts!ayaga’‘n wi'lau wa‘ I-shoot-him arrow with (in which also wa-
        stands outside the verb-complex, acting as an instrumental
        postposition to wila‘u)
   Examples of instrumental wa- are:

  Although, as was suggested before, the prefix wa- as instrument
may be ultimately identical with the adverbial wa- TOGETHER (the
concepts of DOING SOMETHING WITH, BY MEANS OF IT and DOING
SOMETHING TOGETHER WITH IT are not very far removed), the two
can not be regarded as convertible elements. This is clearly brought
out in such forms as bém wa‘twat/oro’xi'n I PICKED THEM TOGETHER
WITH sTIOK. Literally translated, this sentence reads, sTICK I-
TOGETHER-HAND-WITH-IT-PICKED-THEM; the first wa- is the adver-
bial    prefix; 7-, the     general     instrumental        idea     conveyed     by the
character of the verb (GATHER WITH                 ONE’S HANDS);          and the second
wa-, the incorporated representative of the more specific instrument
bém stick. If preferred, 7- may be interpreted, though less prob-
ably, as a local element (twa- =with it in hand).
              2. Formation of Verb-Stems                        (§§ 39, 40)
                            § 39. GENERAL REMARKS
   By a verb-stem will be here understood not so much the simplest
possible form in which a verb appears after being stripped of all its
prefixes, personal elements, tense-forming elements, and derivative
suffixes, but rather the constant portion of the verb in all tense and
mode forms except the aorist. The verb-stem thus defined will in
the majority of cases coincide with the base or root, i. e., the simplest
form at which it is possible to arrive, but not always. Generally
speaking, the aorist is characterized by an enlargement of the base
that we shall term “‘aorist stem,’ the other tense-modes showing
this base in clearer form; in a minority of cases, however, it is the
aorist stem that seems to coincide with the base, while the verb-stem
is an amplification of it.        Examples will serve to render these remarks
somewhat clearer:                    Aorist stem        Verb-stem         Probable base                 tlomom-           doum-             déum- kill

Boas]          HANDBOOK        OF INDIAN LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                             93   By far the larger number of verbal bases are monosyllabic. Where
the simplest radical element that can be analyzed out remains dis-
syllabic    (as in dawi- FLY, agan- PERCEIVE, yimi- LEND), the proba-
bility is always very great that we have to reckon either with ampli-
fications of the base, or with suffixes that have become so thoroughly
amalgamated with the base as to be incapable of separation from it
even in formal analysis; in some cases the dissyllabic character of
the verb-stem is due to a secondary phonetic reason (thus dawi- is
for dawy-, cf. dauy-; while in agan- the second a is inorganic, the
real stem thus being *agn-). Most bases end either in a vowel or, more
frequently, in a single consonant; such as end in two consonants (as
yalg- DIVE, s‘omd- BoIL, bilw- SUMP) may often be plausibly suspected
of containing a petrified suffixed element.
   The few examples of verb and aorist stems already given suffice to
indicate the lack of simple, thorough-going regularity in the forma-
tion of the aorist stem from the base. Given the verb-stem, it is
possible only in the minority of cases to foretell the exact form of the
aorist stem. Thus, if dd“m- had followed the analogy of the pho-
netically parallel na@*g-, we should have in the aorist not t/omom-,
but domo-; similarly, the phonetic similarity of odo- and loho- would
lead us to expect an aorist stem 16%h-, and not lohoi-, for the latter.
Nor is it safe to guess the form of the verb-stem from a given aorist
stem.      Thus, while the aorist lohoi- corresponds to a verb-stem loho-,
yewei- corresponds to yéu- RETURN; nagai-, to na- SAY, DO; and
kleméi-, to k!lemn- DO, MAKE. Mere phonetic form has, indeed, com-
paratively little to do with determining                          the relation of the two
stems.      This is clearly evidenced by the following cases of homony-
mous but etymologically distinct bases with corresponding aorist
stems.","[52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99]"

with two nouns or noun and adjective; the first noun generally
stands in a genitive relation to the second (cf., § 88, the order m
juxtaposed nouns), while the second noun is followed by the third
personal possessive -da. Such are:

(i. e., IN FRONT OF DOORWAY).                      The difficulty with this explanation
is that it necessitates the interpretation                        of the second            noun       as 4
genitive in relation to the first.
 1 Observe falling accent despite rising accent (bas, k/olot)of independent noun.    -da with pre-positive,
whether with intervening noun or noun and adjective, consistently demands a falling accent before it.

                        § 94. GENERAL REMARKS
 Local phrases without possessive pronouns (i. e., of the type IN THE
OUSE, AOROSS THE RIVER) may be constructed in three ways.
 A local element with third personal possessive suffix may be used
) define the position, the noun itself appearing in its absolute form
3an appositive of the incorporated pronominal suffix:
      da’n gwelda* rock under-it (i. e., under the rock)
      da’n handa through the rock
      dan ha’“ya*da around the rock
      dan da‘oldi’‘da near the rock
      dan ge'lda in front of the rock
      dan di’nda behind, the rock
here is observable here, as also in the method nearly always employed
) express the objective and genitive relations, the strong tendency
haracteristic of Takelma and other American languages to make the
ersonal pronominal affixes serve a purely formal purpose as substi-
utes for syntactic and local cases.
  The second and perhaps somewhat more common method used to
uild up a local phrase is to prefix to the noun a pre-positive, the
oun itself appearing in the form it assumes before the addition of
he normal pronominal suffixes (Schemes II and III). Thus some of
he preceding local phrases might have been expressed as:
      gwel-dana‘ under the rock
      han-dana‘ through the rock
       ha’“*ya-dana* around the rock
      .gel-dana* in front of the rock
    di'-dana*‘ behind the rock
‘hese forms have at first blush the appearance of prepositions fol-
wed by a local case of the noun, but we have already seen this
xplanation to be inadmissible.
  A third and very frequent form of local phrase is the absolute
oun followed by a postposition. The chief difference between
his and the preceding method is the very considerable amount
f individual freedom that the postposition possesses as contrasted
ith the rigidly incorporated pre-positive.   The majority of the
ostpositions consist of a pre-positive preceded by the general
emonstrative ga- THAT. da’n gada‘k‘ OVER THE ROCK is thus really

                            § 96. POSTPOSITIONS
   Not all pre-positives can be suffixed to the demonstrative ga- to
form postpositions; e. g., no *gaha‘, *gaha‘n, *gagwe‘l are found in
Takelma. Very few other words (adverbs) are found in which what
are normally pre-positives occupy the second place: me’‘al TOWARD
THIS DIRECTION 58.9; ye/k‘dal IN THE BRUSH 71.3.           Instead of -ha In,
-na‘u is used, an element that seems restricted to the postposition
gana‘u IN. The ga-postpositions that have been found are:
       gada‘k* on 48.15; 49.1
       gidi* (= ga-di*) on, over 49.12
       gidv’* (=ga-di’*) in back

Postpositions may be freely used with nouns provided with a pos-
sessive suffix; e. g., ela’t‘k’ gada‘k* ON MY TONGUE; wild’? gana‘u IX
HIS HOUSE, cf. 194.7. There is no ascertainable difference in significa-
tion between such phrases and the corresponding pre-positive forms,
dak‘-eladé and ha-wili'/‘da. Sometimes a postposition takes in a
group of words, in which case it may be enclitically appended to the
first:
         khiyi’x gan‘au ba-igina’xda* smoke in its-going-out (= [hole] in
       which smoke is to go out) 176.7
  Although local phrases involving a postposition are always pro-
nounced as one phonetic unit, and the postpositions have become,
psychologically speaking, so obscured in etymology as to allow of
their being preceded by the demonstrative with which they are then-
selves compounded (cf. ga ga‘a‘l above), they have enough individu-
ality to render them capable of being used quasi-adverbially without |

   It is peculiar that mountain-names generally have a prefix al- and
  suffix -dis:
      al-dauya’*k‘wa-dis (cf. dauya’*k‘” supernatural helper) 172.1
      al-wila’mza-dis
      al-sawént‘a-dis
   That both al- and -dis are felt not to be integral parts of these
nountain-names is shown by such forms as he*-wila’mza BEYOND
\lwila’mxadis 196.14 and al-dauya’*k’¥. In all probability they are
io be explained as local phrases, aT, To (al-) .. . DISTANT (-dis),
lescriptive of some natural peculiarity or resident supernatural
reing.
  Differing apparently from other postpositions in that it requires
ihe preceding noun to appear in its pre-pronominal form (i. e., with
inal -z if it is provided with it in Scheme II forms) is wa/k‘i* wrrn-
XuT, which would thus seem to occupy a position intermediate
»etween the other postpositions and the pre-positives. Examples are:
      ts lelet wa/k'i* without eyes 26.14; 27.6
      dagaz wa’k'i® without head
      yuk lalz wa’k'i® without teeth 57.4
      niza wa’k‘i® motherless
  As shown by the last example, terms of relationship whose third
versonal possessive suffix is -ra (-a) use the third personal form as
fhe equivalent of the pre-pronominal form of other nouns (cf. also
} 108, 6), a fact that casts a doubt on the strictly personal character
f the -xa suffix.            No third personal idea is possible, e. g., in maza
va/k‘v® ett'e’ I AM FATHERLESS.                    wak‘i§ is undoubtedly related to wa
wiTH; the -k‘i* may be identical with the conditional particle (see § 71).
  On the border-line between loosely used preposition and inde-
r»endent adverb are nogwa‘ BELOW, DOWN RIVER FROM (?=76"" DOWN
uIVER + demonstrative ga THAT) : nogwa wilt BELOW THE HOUSE
16.7; and hinwa*‘ ABOVE, UP RIVER FROM (cf. hina‘u UP RIVER) : hi’nwa
vilt ABOVE THE HOUSE 77.1.

group of suffixes which, though altogether without the distinct indi-
viduality characteristic of local postpositions, are appended to the
fully formed     noun, pronoun, or adjective, in some cases also adverb,
serving in one way or another to limit or extend the range of appli-
cation of one of these denominating or qualifying terms. The line
of demarcation between these post-nominal elements and the more
freely movable modal       particles discussed below        (§ 114) is not very
easy to draw; the most convenient criterion of classification is the
inability of what we have termed PosT-NOMINAL elements to attach
themselves to verb-forms.
                              § 98. EXCLUSIVE    -t‘a  The suffix -f‘a is freely appended to nouns and adjectives, less fre-
quently to pronouns, in order to specify which one out of a number
is meant; the implication is always that the particular person, object,
or quality mentioned is selected out of a number of alternative and
mutually exclusive possibilities.      When used with adjectives -t‘a has
sometimes the appearance of forming the comparative or superlative;
e. g., aga (1) tlos:6’""¢'a (2) THIS (1) I8 SMALLER (2), but such an inter-
pretation hardly hits the truth of the matter. The sentence just
 quoted really signifies THIs Is SMALL (NOT LARGE LIKE THAT). Asa
matter of fact, -t‘a is rather idiomatic in its use, and not susceptible
of adequate translation into English, the closest rendering being
generally a dwelling of the voice on the corresponding English word,
The following examples illustrate its range of usage:
      hapzit!7’‘t‘a child male (not female) (i. e., boy) 14.1; 156.8
      wa-iwi''t‘a gatal yewe’ the-woman to he-turned (i. e., he now
         proceeded to look at the woman, after having examined her
         husband) 15.14                    ,

ts becoming -da (as in @’k‘da above) an inorganic a seems to be
idded in:

          klulsa‘t’ 130.22)
                       § 99. PLURAL     (-f<an, -han, -k/an)  As a rule, it is not considered necessary in Takelma to specify the
singularity or plurality of an object, the context generally serving to
remove the resulting ambiguity.      In this respect Takelma resembles
many other American languages. The element -(a)n, however, is
aot infrequently employed to form a plural, but this plural is of
rather indefinite application when the noun is supplied with a third
personal possessive suffix (compare        what was said above,            § 91, in
regard to -gwan).      The fact that the plurality implied by the suffix
may have reference to either the object possessed or to the possessor
or to both (e. g., beya’nhan HIS DAUGHTERS                or THEIR DAUGHTER,
THEIR DAUGHTERS) makes it very probable that we are here dealing,
not with the simple idea of plurality, but rather with that of reci-
procity. It is probably not accidental that the plural -(a)n agrees
phonetically with the reciprocal element -an- found in the verb.                   In
no case is the plural suffix necessary in order to give a word its full
syntactic form; it is always appended to the absolute noun or to the
noun with its full complement of characteristic and pronominal affix.
   The simple form -(a)n of the suffix appears only in the third per-
sonal reflexive possessive -gwa-n (see § 91) and, apparently, the third
personal possessive -t‘an of pre-positive local phrases (see p. 238).
Many absolute nouns ending in a vowel, or in 1, m, or n, also nouns
with personal affixes (including pre-positives with possessive suffixes)
other than that of the third person, take the form -han of the plural
                                                                               § 99

   A large number of chiefly personal words and all nouns provided
with a possessive suffix of the third person take -t‘an as the plural
suffix; the -t‘an of local adverbs or nouns with pre-positives has
been explained as composed of the third personal suffix -¢‘ and the
pluralizing element -han: no’ts!a*t‘an HIS NEIGHBORS. In some cases,
as in wa-wi''t'an GIRLS 55.16; 106.17, -t‘an may be explained as
composed of the exclusive -t‘a discussed above and the plural -n.
The fact, however, that -t‘an may itself be appended both to this
exclusive -¢‘a and to the full third personal form of nouns not pro
vided with a pre-positive makes it evident that the -t'a- of the plural
suffix -t‘an is an element distinct from either the exclusive -f‘a or
third personal -¢'.   -t‘d*t‘a-n is perhaps etymologically as well as
phonetically parallel to the unexplained -da*da of da’k‘da*da oven
HIM (see §93). Examples of -t‘an are:

   The plural form -k/an is appended to nouns in -la’p‘a and to the
»hird personal -za(-a) of terms of relationship. As -k/-' is appended
»o nouns in -la’p‘a also before the characteristic -i- followed by a
dossessive suffix, it is clear that -k/an is a compound suffix consisting
>f an unexplained -k/- and the plural element -(a)n. Examples of
‘lan are:

   The suffix -dtl(-di‘l) is appended to a noun or pronoun to indicate
the duality of its occurrence, or to restrict its naturally indefinite or
plural application to two. It is not a true dual in the ordinary sense
of the word, but indicates rather that the person or object indicated
by the noun to which it is suffixed is accompanied by another person
or object of the same kind, or by a person or object mentioned before
or after; in the latter case it is equivalent to aND connecting two
denominating terms.                  Examples illustrating its use are:
        go“mdi'l we two (restricted from gd“m we)
        gadil go“m         thémzinigam            we     two, that one            and     I, will wrestle
           (literally,        that-one-and-another                  [namely,         I]    we      we-shall-
           wrestle) 30.5
        sgi’sidi'l two coyotes (literally, coyote-and-another [coyote])
        wazadi'l two brothers (lit., [he] and his younger brother) 26.12
     sgisi ni’xadi‘l Coyote and his mother 54.2
   The element -dtl doubtless occurs as an adjective stem meaning
ALL, EVERY, in aldil ALL 134.4 (often heard also as aldt 47.9; 110.16;
188.1); hadedtlt‘a EVERYWHERE 43.6; 92.29; and hat‘gadilt‘a IN
EVERY LAND 122.20.
                                        § 101.    -wié every   This element is freely appended to nouns, adjectives, and adverbs,
but has no independent existence of its own. Examples are:
        beewi‘ every day (literally, every sun) 42.1; 158.17
        ziu’*nwit every night (xi’'n, zii’‘ne‘ night, at night)

-k!- or -g- was pronounced.   -k/i- and -k/an may thus be really -gi- and -gan.

part of the whole word and in having a considerably stronger con-
trastive force. Unlike -¢‘a, it may be suffixed to adverbs as well as
to words of a more strictly denominative character.                      Examples of
its occurrence are extremely numerous, but only a very few of these

  The independent personal pronouns of Takelma, differing in this
spect from what is found to be true of most American languages,
how not the slightest etymological relationship to any of the various
ronominal series found incorporated in noun and verb, except in so
ar as the second person plural is formed from the second person sin-
ular by the addition of the element -p‘ that we have found to be
haracteristic of every second person plural in the language. The
orms, which may be used both as subjects and objects, are as
ollows:
  Singular: First person, gt 56.10; 122.8; second person, ma‘ (ma*)
6.7; 98.8;        third      person,     Gk‘    27.5;    156.12.    Plural:        First   person,
6“m      30.5;     150.16;      second     person, ma@p‘;          third    person Gi 49.11;
ilamana‘ 27.10; 56.1
  Of the two third personal plural pronouns, di is found most fre-
juently used with post-positive elements; e. g., dyd’* JusT THEY
 = Gi ya’/*) 160.6; a@’*ya‘ THEY (= dGi-‘a‘) 49.11. When unaccom-
vanied by one of these, it is generally pluralized: @’it‘an (see § 99).
the second, zilamana‘, despite its four syllables, has not in the
lightest yielded to analysis.                  It seems to be but little used in normal
peech or narrative.                                                                 .
 All the pronouns may be emphasized by the addition of -wi* (see
101), the deictic -*a‘ (see §102), or the post-positive particles ya’
und enclitic -hi and -s‘i§ (see § 114, 1, 2, 4):

23.2; 154.18, 19, 20; a-isde’* yours; a/-is'da HIS 23.2, 3; (156.7)

have really no greater concreteness of force than the English transla-

        § 104.      Demonstrative              Pronouns               and      Adverts   Four demonstrative stems, used both attributively and substan-
tively, are found: a-, ga, ida-, and ha*-. Of these only ga THAT
occurs commonly as an independent word; the rest, as the first ele
ments of composite forms.                   The demonstratives as actually found
are:

ida- (independently 46.5; 47.5; 192.6) seems to be itself a compound
element, its first syllable being perhaps identifiable with 7- HAND.
ida‘a’it‘an and haa@’it‘an, referred to above, are in effect the sub-
stantive plurals of i’/daga and ha’“ga.  ha*- as demonstrative pro-
noun is doubtless identical with the local ha@*- YONDER, BEYOND,
found as a prefix in the verb.

ous}          HANDBOOK     OF INDIAN    LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                   253 By far the most commonly used of the demonstratives is that of
adefinite reference, ga. It is used as an anaphoric pronoun to refer
o both things and persons of either number, also to summarize a pre-
eding phrase or statement.   Not infrequently the translation THAT
tT THOSE is too definite; a word of weaker force, like rr, better
erves the purpose.        The association of i’daga and ha’ga with spa-
ial positions corresponding to the second and third persons respec-
ively does not seem to be at all strong, and it is perhaps more accu-
ate to render them as THAT RIGHT AROUND THERE and THAT YONDER.
differing fundamentally in this respect from adjectives, demonstra-
ive pronouns regularly precede the noun or other substantive ele-
nent they modify:
       a’ga sgi’si this coyote 108.1
       idaga yap!a*‘ that person
       ga ‘aldil all that, all of those 47.12

       Vdaga hesd""ma‘l beyond that mountain 122.22;              124.1
 Corresponding to the four demonstrative pronoun-stems are four
lemonstrative adverb-stems, derived from the former by a change
f the vowel -a- to -e-: e-, ge, ide-, and he*-.        Just as ga THAT was
‘ound to be the only demonstrative freely used as an independent
wonoun, sO gé THERE, alone of the four adverbial stems, occurs outside
f compounds.       e-, ide-, and he*-, however, are never compounded
vith ge, as are a-, ida-, and ha*- with its pronominal correspondent
1a; a fifth adverbial stem of demonstrative force, me® (HITHER as
verbal prefix), takes its place.       The actual demonstrative adverbs
ihus are:
     Indefinite. ge there 64.6; 77.9; 194.11
     Near first. eme’® here 112.12, 13; 194.4; me‘- hither
     Near second. 7’deme‘ right around there 46.15
     Near third. he’ *me*® yonder 31.13
  Of these, me®-, the correlative of he®-, can be used independently
when followed by the local -al : me’‘al ON THIS SIDE, HITHERWARDS
38.9; 160.4. he*’- away, besides        frequently   occurring     as a verbal
prefix, is found as a component of various adverbs:
       he‘dada’‘, he*da’* over there, away from here, off 46.8; 194.10
       he’'ne‘ then, at that time 120.2; 146.6; 162.3

ceding; the compound, followed by di, is employed in an interroga-
tive sense: geme’‘di WHERE?        WHEN?   56.10; 100.16; 190.25. The
idea of direction in the demonstrative adverbs seems less strong
than that of position: he’ **me* baza’*m HE COMES FROM OVER THERE,
as well as he’ *me‘ gini’*k‘ HE GOES OVERTHERE.    me‘- and he“-(hi“-),
however, often necessarily convey the notions of TOWARD and awaY
FROM the speaker: me’'-yewe* ha’*-yewe HE CAME AND WENT BACK
AND FORTH.
  Demonstrative      adverbs may take the restrictive suffix -da‘z or
-daba’‘x (cf. -da‘x with personal pronouns,    §103):
      eme‘da’*x 114.4, 5
      eme‘daba’*x aaa here alone
         § 105.   Interrogative    and     Indefinite Pronouns
   As independent words, the interrogative and indefinite stems occur
with adverbs or adverbial particles, being found in their bare form
only when incorporated.       The same stems are used for both inter-
rogative and indefinite purposes, a distinction being made between
persons and things:                                                |
      nek* who? some one 86.2, 23; 108.11                                   |
      k‘ai what? something 86.5; 122.3; 128.8                               |
As independent adverb also PERHAPS:                                         |
      k‘ai tliimiizi perhaps he’ll strike me 23.3                           |
   As interrogatives, these stems are always followed by the interroga |
tive enclitic particle di, k‘ai always appearing as k‘a- when di imme
diately follows:                                                       |
      ne'k‘-di who? 46.15; 86.4;   142.9
      k‘a’-di what?   47.9; 60.11; 86.8
k‘a’i_. . . di occurs with post-positive ga‘a‘l:
      k‘a’t ga‘al di‘ what for? why?     71.15; 86.14; 98.8
As indefinites, they are often followed by the composite particle
-s'wa'k'di:                                                                 |
      nek'-s'i*wa’k'di I don’t know who, somebody 22.8                      |
     k‘ai-s'i*wa’k‘di I don’t know what, something 96.10            |
As negative indefinites, nek’ and k‘ai are preceded by the negative
adverb ani‘ or wede, according to the tense-mode of the verb (see
§ 72):                                              :

With the post-nominal -wi’* every, k‘ai forms k‘aiwi/* EVERYTHING,
30METHING.   No such form as *nek‘wi’*, however, occurs, its place
oeing taken by aldtl, aldt ALL, EVERYBODY.  In general, it may be
said that k‘ai has more of an independent substantival character
shan nek‘; it corresponds to the English Taine in its more indefinite
sense, e. g., k'a’t gwala MANY          THINGS,     EVERYTHING      96.15;   102.11;
108.8
   The     adverbial   correspondent of k‘ai is gui How? WHERE?                46.2;
78.5. In itself gwi is quite indefinite in signification and is as such
often used with the forms of na(g)- po, acr 47.11; 55.7:
     gui'di nagatt' how are you doing? (e. g., where are you going?)
          86.17;   (138.25)
As interrogative, it is followed by di:
        gwi'di how? where?         44.5; 70.6; 73.9; 190.10
as indefinite, by -s‘i®wa’k‘di (cf. 190.4):
        gwis’i*wa'k‘di in some way, somewhere           54.7; 96.8; 120.21 (also
        gui’hap‘ somewhere)
as negative indefinite, it is preceded by a’ni* or wede:
        a’ni® gui‘ in no way, nowhere 23.6; 62.11;         192.14
        we'de gui na‘t’ do not go anywhere!
As indefinite relative is used gwi’ha WHERESOEVER 140.9, 13, 15, 19.

                         § 106.     General    Remarks
   Adjectives can not in Takelma without further ado be classed as
nouns or verbs, as they have certain characteristics that mark them
off more or less clearly from both; such are their distinctly adjectival
suffixes and their peculiar method of forming the plural. In some
respects they closely approach the verb, as in the fact that they are
frequently preceded by body-part prefixes, also in the amplification
of the stem in the plural in ways analogous to what we have found
in the verb.       They differ, however, from verbal forms in that they
can not be predicatively used (except that the simple form of the
adjective may be predicatively understood for an implied third per-
son), nor provided with the pronominal suffixes peculiar to the verb;
                                                                             § 106
                                                               peer
256                   BUREAU    OF    AMERICAN      ETHNOLOGY                          [ BULL.40a first or second personal relation is brought about by the use of
appropriate forms of the copula ei- BE.               They agree with the noun
and pronoun in being frequently followed by the distinctly denomi-
native    exclusive   suffix -t‘a    (see   § 98)   and   in the    fact       that,     when
forming part of a descriptive noun, they may take the personal end-
ings peculiar to the noun:
      ts: lizi-maha’it'
                      ek‘ dog-big-my (= my horse)
As adjectives pure and simple, however, they are never found with
the possessive suffixes peculiar to the noun; e. g., no such form as
*maha’it'ek‘ alone ever occurs. It thus appears that the adjective
occupies a position midway between the noun and the verb, yet with
characteristics peculiar to itself. The most marked syntactic feature
of the adjective is that, unlike a qualifying noun, it always follows
the modified noun, even when incorporated with it (see § 93).                              Ex-
amples are:
      wa-iwi't da girl pretty 55.7; 124.5
      yapla daldi‘ person wild 22.14
      sgi’si da-sga’xit’ Coyote sharp-snouted 86.3, 20; 88.1, 11
    pim cum yele‘x debii’* salmon dry burden-basket full (= burden-
     _ basket full of dry salmon) 75.10
  Rarely does it happen that the adjective precedes, in which case
it is to be predicatively understood:
      gwa'la yapla’ many (were) the people 180.16 (but ya’p!a gwala'
          people many 194.10)
Even when predicatively used, however, the adjective regularly fol-
lows the noun it qualifies. Other denominating words or phrases
than adjectives are now and then used to predicate a statement or
command:
      yi’ klale (1) wa’k'ié (2), ga (3) ga®al (4) deligia’lt’s (5) gwas (6) [as
         they were] without (2) teeth (1), for (4) that (3) [reason] they

                       § 107.   Adjectival Prefixes
  Probably all the body-part prefixes and also a number                                of the
purely local elements are found as prefixes in the adjective.                             The
material at hand is not large enough to enable one to follow out the
prefixes of the adjective as satisfactorily as those of the verb; but

  An example of an adjective preceded by two body-part prefixes has
  already been given (ha-gwel-bila‘m).     Here both prefixes are coordi
  nate in function (cf. ha-gwel-pliya’, § 95). In:
         xa°-sal-gwa'si       between-claws-yellow      (myth name           of Sparrow-
            Hawk)     166.2
  the two body-part prefixes are equivalent to an incorporated local
  phrase (cf. § 35, 4)

     A considerable number of adjectives are primitive in form, i. e.,
  not capable of being derived from simpler nominal or verbal stems.
  Such are:

ind many others.              A very large number, however, are provided with
lerivative suffixes, some of which are characteristic of adjectives
ver se,! while others serve to convert nouns and pre-positive phrases
nto adjectives.            Some adjectival stems seem capable of being used
‘ither with or without a suffix (cf. da-sga’xi and de-ts‘liigii‘t’ above,

5. -(a)a.      This suffix disappears in the plural (see below, § 109),
          so that no room is left for doubt as to its non-radical character.
          Whether it is to be identified with the non-agentive -z of the
          verb is somewhat uncertain, but that such is the case is by no|
          means improbable; in some cases, indeed, the adjective in -2
          is connected with a verb in -z.   The -a‘pr of some of the
          examples is without doubt composed of the petrified -b- found
          in a number of verbs (see § 42, 1) and the adjectival                  (or nor
          agentive) -z.

  More transparently derivational in character than any of thos

6. -gwat' Havine.              Adjectival forms in -gwa‘t' are derived partly
         ‘by the addition of the adjectival suffix -(a)t‘ to third personsl
          reflexive possessive forms in -'t‘gwa (-zagwa), or to palatalized
          passive participial        forms in -‘%'"", themselves derived from
          nouns (see § 77), partly by the addition of -gwa't' to nouns it

         -gwa‘t' forms, despite their at least apparent diversity of origin,
         clearly form a unit as regards signification, suggests an ultimate
         identity of the noun reflexive -gwa (and therefore verbal
         indirect reflexive -gwa-) with the passive participial -k‘”. The
         -gwa- of forms in -z-gwat' is not quite clear, but is perhaps to
         be identified with the comitative -gwa- of the verb.            An
         adjective like yiu’k /al-z-gwat' TEETH-HAVING presents a parallel-
        ‘ism to a verbal participle like dak‘-ltm-z-gwat' WITH (TREE)
        FALLING OVER ONE (from aorist dak‘-limtm-z-gwa-de® I AM WITH
        IT FALLING OVER ME, see § 46) that is suggestive of morphologic
        identity. Examples of -gwa‘t' adjectives are:
      waya’uxagwat’ having daughter-in-law 56.10 (cf. waya’uxagwa
         her own daughter-in-law)
      tgwana’t'gwat* slave-having (cf. t‘gwana’t'gwa his own slave)
      Da-t‘én-ela’%t‘gwat'! Squirrel-Tongued (literally, in-mouth squirrel
         his-tongue having [name of Coyote’s daughter]) 70.6; 72.4;
         75.11
      ni’xagwat‘ mother-having (cf. n2’zak‘” mothered)
      me’zragwat' father-having (cf. me’zak‘” fathered)
      k‘e*lé’ p‘igigwat* wife-having (cf. k‘elée’p‘igik’” wived 142.6)
      gi""zgwa't' wife-having 128.4 (cf. gii*-z-de‘k‘ my wife 142.9)
      dagazgwa'‘t‘ head-having (cf. da’g-az-dek‘ my head 90.13)
      ts'!u'legwat‘ having              Indian       money        (cf. ¢s*/u‘lz Indian             money
         14.13)
  A form with -gwat' and the copula ei- (for persons other than the
        third) takes the place in Takelma of the verb HAVE:
      ts‘!u'lagwat ett‘e’ I have money (literally money-having                                             or
          moneyed I-am                                                              ‘
    ts‘ !ulz-gwa‘t' he has money
  Aside from the fact that it has greater individuality as a distinct
         phonetic unit, the post-positive wa’k'* wirHouT is the mor-
         phologic correlative of -gwat' HAVING:
    dagaz wa’k*i' ett‘ head without you-are
    da’ gaxgwat' eit‘ head-having you-are
  Similarly:
    niza wa’k'i ett‘e® mother without I-am
    ni’ xagwat' ett‘e’ mother-having I-am
  1Th e fact that this form has a body-part prefix (da- MoUTH) seems to imply its verbal (participial)
haracter.   -¢‘gwat' in it, and forms like it, may have to be anaiyzed, not as -t'gwa HIS OWN+ -t', but rather
3-t' HIS+-gwa- HAVING+-{'.        In other words, from a noun-phrase t'dn eld’a (older eld’ct') SQUIRREL HIS.
‘ONGUE may be theoretically formed a comitative intransitive with prefix: *da-+dn-eld’at'-gwade® I AM
IAVING SQUIRREL’S TONGUE IN MY MOUTH, of which thé text-form is the participle.          This explanation has
he advantage over the one given above of putting forms in -’t‘gwaz' and -2gwat' onone line; cf. also 73.15.","[245, 246, 247, 248, 249, 250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259, 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, 265, 266, 267]"

   The “rising” pitch (~) is found only on long vowels and short or
long diphthongs. The rising pitch is for a long vowel or diphthong
what the raised pitch is for a short vowel or shortened diphthong;
the essential difference between the two being that in the latter case
the accented vowel is sung on a single tone reached without an inter-
mediate slur from the lower level, whereas in the case of the rising
pitch the affected vowel or diphthong changes in pitch in the course
of pronunciation; the first part of the long vowel and the first vowel
of the diphthong are sung on a tone intermediate between the normal
level and the raised pitch, while the parasitic element of the long
vowel and the second vowel (i or u) of the diphthong are hit by the
raised tone itself.             Itis easy to understand that in rapid pronuncia-
tion the intermediate tone of the first part of the long vowel or diph-
thong would be hurried over and sometimes dropped altogether; this
means that a long vowel or diphthong with rising pitch (@, at) becomes
a short vowel or shortened diphthong with raised pitch                                            (a‘, a‘%).?
Diphthongs consisting of a short vowel +1, m, or n, and provided
with a rising pitch, ought, in strict analogy, to appear as afi, al, aii;
and so on for the other vowels.                        This is doubtless the correct repre-
sentation, and such forms as:
     naiik* he will say, do
        gwalt' wind
        dasmayafi he smiled
    wulz enemy, Shasta
were actually heard, the liquid or nasal being distinctly higher in
pitch than the preceding vowel.                         In the majority of cases, however,
  1 It iscurious that the effect to our ears of the Takelma declarative helela’¢' is of an interrogative DID rou
sina? while conversely the effect of an interrogative helela’t'idi is that of a declarative you DID sING.
This is entirely accidental in so far as a rise in pitch has nothing to do in Takelma with an interrogation.       —
   3A vowel marked with the accent ~ is necessarily long, so that the mark of length and the parasitic
vowel can be conveniently omitted.

syllable with rising pitch followed by an unaccented syllable is neces-
sarily different from that of a syllable with falling pitch (+), or of a
syllable with raised pitch followed by an unaccented syllable, because
of the steady rise in pitch before the succeeding fall.              The tendency

diphthongs, its essential characteristic being, as already defined, 8
steady fall from a tone higher than the normal level. The peak of
the falling inflection may coincide in absolute pitch with that of the
rising inflection, though it is often somewhat higher, say an interval
of a fourth above the ordinary level.            The base (lowest tone) of the
fall is not assignable to any definite relative pitch, the gamut run
through by the voice depending largely upon the character of the
syllable. If the accent hits a long vowel or diphthong not immedi-
ately followed by a catch, the base will, generally speaking, coincide
with the normal level, or lie somewhat below it. If the long vowed
or diphthong be immediately followed by an unaccented syllable, the
base is apt to strike this unaccented syllable at an interval of about
a third below the level. If the vowel or diphthong be immediately
followed by a catch, the fall in pitch will be rapidly checked, and the
whole extent of the fall limited to perhaps not more than a semitone. -
As soon, however, as the catch is removed (as often happens on the
addition to the form of certain grammatical elements), the fall runs
through its usual gamut.         The words
         k‘wede’t his name
         yewe’ida® when he returned
         yewe’# he returned
will serve to illustrate the character of the falling pitch.

      The      pronunciation          of the diphthongs              is now easily             understood
A shortened diphthong (a%, a’) sounds to an American ear like an
indivisible entity, very much like ai and au in HIGH and How; a
diphthong with falling pitch (a’2) is naturally apt to be heard as two
distinct vowels, so that one is easily led to write naga’-ida‘ instead of
naga’idat WHEN HE SAID; 8 diphthong with rising pitch (at) is heard
either as a pure diphthong or as two distinct vowels, according to
the speed of utterance or the accidents of perception. All these
interpretations, however, are merely matters of perception by an
American ear and have in themselves no objective value. It would
be quite misleading, for instance, to treat Takelma diphthongs as
“pure” and “impure,” no regard being had to pitch, for such a classi-
fication is merely a secondary consequence of the accentual phenomena
we have just considered.
   One other point in regard to the diphthongs should be noted. It
is important to distinguish between organic diphthongs, in which each
element of the diphthong has a distinct radical or etymological value,
and secondary diphthongs, arising from an 1, u, l, m, or n with pre-
fixed inorganic a. The secondary diphthongs (ai, au, al, am, an),
being etymologically single vowels or semivowels, are always unitonal
in character; they can have the raised, not the rising accent. Con-
trast the inorganic au of
        bila‘uk* (=*bilw‘k',' not *bilatik‘) he jumped;                             cf. bilwa’*s JUMPER
with the organic au of
        gayati he ate it; cf. gayawa’'n I ate it
Contrast similarly the inorganic an of
        klema‘nk' (=*klemn‘k‘, not *k!emafik') he made it; cf. k/emna’'s
              maker
with the organic am of
        dasmayami he smiled; cf. dasmayama’n I smiled
Phonetically such secondary diphthongs are hardly different from
shortened organic diphthongs; etymologically and, in consequence,
in morphologic treatment, the line of difference is sharply drawn.

20                      BUREAU     OF   AMERICAN   ETHNOLOGY           [BULL.40   It was said that any particular syllable, if accented, necessarily
receives a definite pitch-inflection. If it is furthermore pointed out
that distinct words and forms may differ merely in the character of
the accent, and that definite grammatical forms are associated with
definite accentual forms, it becomes evident that pitch-accent has
not unimportant bearing on morphology. Examples of words differ-
ing only in the pitch-accent are:
       se’*l black paint, writing; sé kingfisher
       la’*p‘ leaves; (1) lap‘ he carried it on his back, (2) lép* become (so
          and so)!
       sa’*t‘ his discharge of wind; s@t‘ mash it!
       wili’t his house; wilt house, for instance, in dak‘wilt on top of
            the house
      he’     song; hél sing it!
Indeed, neither vowel-quantity, accent, nor the catch can be consid-
ered negligible factors in Takelma phonology, as shown by the
following:                   .
       waya knife
       waya’* his knife
       waya’* he sleeps
       wayan he put him to sleep
       klwéfya’    (=k !wat‘a‘) just grass
   It is impossible to give any simple rule for the determination of
the proper accent of all words. What has been ascertained in regard
to the accent of certain forms or types of words in large part seems
to be of a grammatic, not purely phonetic, character, and hence will
most naturally receive treatment when the forms themselves are dis-
cussed.       Here it will suffice to give as illustrations of the morphologic
value of accent a few of the cases:
   (1) Perhaps the most comprehensive generalization that can be
made in regard to the employment of accents is that a catch requires
the falling pitch-accent on an immediately preceding stressed syllable,
as comes out most clearly in forms where the catch has been second-
arily removed. Some of the forms affected are:
   (a) The first person singular subject third person object aorist of
the transitive verb, as in:
       tlomoma’'n I kill him
       tlomoma’ndaé as I killed him
     § 5
BOAS]          HANDBOOK       OF   INDIAN   LANGUAGES—TAKELMA          21   (6) The third person aorist of all intransitive verbs that take the
catch as the characteristic element of this person and tense, as in:
     ya’= he went
        ya’da* when he went
   (c) The second person singular possessive of nouns whose ending
for this person and number is -‘t‘, as in:
      t/t’ your husband
        ela’*t‘ your tongue
Contrast:
        titt‘k’ my husband
        ela‘t'k* my tongue
There are but few exceptions to this rule. A certain not very nu-
merous class of transitive verbs, that will later occupy us in the treat-
ment of the verb, show a long vowel with rising pitch before a catch
in the first person singular subject third person object aorist, as in:
        klemén I make it
        ditligi*n I wear it
The very isolation of these forms argues powerfully for the general
correctness of the rule.
   (2) The first person singular subject third person object future, and
the third person aorist passive always follow the accent of 1a:
        dé""ma’n I shall kill him
        tlomoma’n he was killed
Contrast:
        zo""ma‘n he dried it
Like kleme*n in accent we have also:
        klemén it was made
   (3) The first person singular possessive of nouns whose ending for
that person and number is -¢‘k‘ shows a raised or rising pitch, according
to whether the accented vowel is short or long (or diphthongal) :
      k‘wedett'k* my name
      plant'k* my liver
      tlibagwa‘nt'k* my pancreas
Contrast:
      k‘wede’t his name
      pla'nt' his liver
        tlibagwa’n his pancreas

        sgelewa'lda'n I shouted to him
     sgelewa'lt’ he shouted to him
Contrast:
     gwalt’ wind
Many more such rules could be given, but these will suffice at present
to show what is meant by the “fixity” of certain types of accent in
morphological classes.
     This fixity of accent seems to require a slight qualification.                                    A
tendency is observable to end up a sentence with the raised pitch, so
that a syllable normally provided with a falling pitch-accent may
sometimes, though by no means always, assume a raised accent, if it is
the last syllable of the sentence. The most probable explanation of
this phenomenon is that the voice of a Takelma speaker secks its
rest in a rise, not, as is the habit in English as spoken in America, in
a fall.
                              Vocalic Processes               (§§ 6-11)
                                      § 6. VOWEL        HIATUS     There is never in Takelma the slightest tendency to avoid the com-
ing together of two vowels by elision of one of the vowels or con-
traction of the two.                So carefully, indeed, is each vowel kept intact
that the hiatus is frequently strengthened by the insertion of a catch.
If the words ya’pla MAN and a’ni* Not, for instance, should come
together in that order in the course of the sentence, the two a- vowels
would not coalesce into one long vowel, but would be separated by
an    inorganic        (i.    e.,   not    morphologically           essential)       catch      yapla
fa'ni§.     The same thing happens when two verbal prefixes, the first
ending in and the second                   beginning with a vowel, come together.
Thus:

     2a*- between, in two

     de%-
       wai

   1 Those familiar with Indogermanic phonology will have noticed that my use of the symbols (¢), (), and
(=) has been largely determined by the method adopted in linguistic works for the representation of the
syllabic pitch-accents of Lithuanian; the main departures being the use of the (+) on short as well ason
long vowels and the assignment of a different meaning to the (+).","[23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28]"

he forms involving k/emen- are quite similar morphologically to
eriphrastic futures in -gulug’-, the main point of difference being
iat, while k/emen- occurs as independent verb, -gulug’- is never
und without a prefix. The forms involving n@’g- are probably best
msidered as consisting of an imperative followed by a quotative
erb form.              Thus yana nak‘i is perhaps best rendered as “Go!” say
tto Him!           The form hoida-yo’k‘ya‘s (hoid-          DANCE+ connective      -a-)
NE WHO           KNOWS      HOW TO DANCE suggests that similar compound
erbs can be formed from yok‘y- KNOW.
                            §'70.    SUBORDINATING       FORMS  A number of syntactic suffixes are found in Takelma, which, when
ppended to a verbal form, serve to give it a subordinate or depend-
nt value.    Such subordinate forms bear a temporal, causal, condi-
ional, or relative relation to the main verb of the sentence, but are
ften best translated simply as participles.                Four such subordinating
uffixes have been found:
 -da‘(-t‘a*), serving to subordinate the active forms of the aorist.
  -ma*, subordinating those of the passive aorist.
  -na‘, subordinating all inferential forms in -k*. Periphrastic infer-
ntial forms in ett‘ and ett'p‘ are treated like aorists, the form-giving
lements of such periphrases being indeed nothing but.the second
erson singular and plural aorist of ¢- BE.

nate constructions, a few remarks on the subordinate forms themselv
will be in place.
   The aoristic -da‘- forms of an intransitive verb like hog*- RUN are:
Singular:
                            Independent               Subordinate
     First person.     . ho’k‘de® I run           ho’k‘deeda® when I rai

     Third person    . ho’‘k‘                   ho'k‘da*
Plural:            ;
     First person. . hogwi‘k'                   hoguiga’m

Impersonal      . . . hodguia’™                 hogwia’-udat
   Of these forms, that of the first person plural in -a’m is identica
as far as the suffix is concerned, with     the future form of      the co
responding person and number.          The example given above (ki
gwiga’m) was found. used quite analogously to the more transp
rently subordinate forms of the other persons (alzi’‘zam hogwiga'
HE SAW US RUN, like alzi/‘2i ho’k‘de*da’ HE SAW ME RUN); the form:
the stem is all that keeps apart the future and the subordinate aori
of the first person plural (thus hogwiga’m WE SHALL RUN with short
No form in -i’k‘da‘, such as might perhaps be expected, was foun
The catch of the first and third person singular of class I verbs di
appears before the -da® (see § 22). The falling accent of the sten
however, remains, and the quantity of the stressed vowel           is lengtl
ened unless followed by a diphthong-forming element.            Thus:
      ya’*da* when he went 58.8 (ya’* he went 96.8); cf. 188.17
      ba-1-kliyi’k‘da* when he came   (ba-1-k!iyi’*k* he came    156.24)
      yawa’idaé as they were talking 130.13 (yawa’* they talked)
      xebe’nda® when he did so 142.10 (webe’'n he did so 118.14)
The subordinate form of the third person aorist of class II intrans
tives ends in -t'a‘ if the immediately preceding vowel has a            risi
accent. Thus:
      s‘as‘init‘a® when he stood (s‘as‘int he stood 120.12)
    lop/at‘a® when it rained (lop/o‘t' it rained 90.1)
In the second person singular the personal -¢' and the -d- of tl
subordinating suffix amalgamate to-d-. The subordinate second pe
son plural in -t‘ba* is not improbably simply formed on the analog
of the corresponding singular form in -da‘, the normal differen

subordinates of transitive forms in -dam and ~dap‘ the subordinate
forms of the second persons of class IT intransitives end in -¢‘a‘ (-da*‘)

         sasinit'a’ when you stood (s°as‘intt‘am you stood)
         s'as‘init‘ba® when ye stood (s‘as*intt'ap’ ye stood)
Note the ambiguity of the form s‘as*tntt‘a® WHEN HE OR YOU STOOD;
compare the similar ambiguity in naga’-ida‘ WHEN                                                            HE      sAID       and
naga-da’® WHEN YOU SAID 130.14; 132.23.
  The transitive subordinates of the aorist are also characterized by
a suffixed -da‘, except that forms with a third personal subject
invariably substitute -(a)na’* (ina’® with first person plural object),
and that the personal endings -dam (THOU—ME) and -dap‘ (yE—mxE)
become simply -da* and -daba‘ respectively. The latter forms are
thus distinguished                    from non-subordinate                               futures merely by the

The use of the aorist stem in the subordinate, it will be observed,
also the only characteristic that serves to keep distinct the thir
personal subjective subordinates and the future forms of the passiv:
     al-xi'‘xbina® when he saw you, but al-zi’*xbina* you will be see
It may be noted that the third personal subjective aorist forms:
the transitive may be mechanically formed, like the passives of th
same tense, from the first person singular subject third person obje
aorist by merely dropping the glottal catch of the latter form an
adding -a*.    Thus:
      gel-hewe'hana® when   he thought    45.2; 142.10,   13,   16   (cf. ge
      hewe’ha'n I thought); but gel-hewe’hau he thought 44.11
The subordinate of the form with personal object -k‘va is formed b
adding -na*:
      malak‘wana‘ when he told him 72.14 (malak‘wa he told him 142.:
   The aorist passive subordinates cause no trouble whatever, tl
characteristic ~ma‘ being in every case simply appended to the fin
-n of the passive form:
     t!omoma’nma* when he was killed 146.22 (from ¢/omoma’n he wi
        killed 148.3)
      tlomézanbanmat when you (plural) were killed
  The complete subordinate inferential paradigm is rather motley i
appearance; -na* is suffixed to the third personal subject in -x':
     plak'na® when he bathed
     laba’k‘na® when he carried it 126.5
     gatk‘na® when he ate it
      diimzik'naé when he killed me
The first person singular in -k‘a‘(n) becomes -k‘anda‘; the fir
person plural subordinate was not obtained, but doubtless hi
-k‘anaga’m as ending. The subordinate of the passive in -k‘am i
regularly formed by the addition of -na*:

Examples will now be given of constructions illustrating the use
 subordinate forms.    It is artificial, from a rigidly native point of
2»w, to speak of causal, temporal, relative, and other uses of the
bordinate; yet an arrangement                     of Takelma     examples     from the
»w-point of English syntax has the advantage of bringing out
wre clearly the range of possibility in the use of subordinates.
ie subordinate clause may be directly attached to the rest of the
atence,             or, if its temporal,   causal, or other significance needs to
     clearly brought out, it may be introduced by a relative adverb
 pronoun (WHERE, WHEN, HOW, WHO).             Both constructions are
metimes possible; e. g., a sentence like 1 DO NOT KNOW WHO KILLED
mM may be rendered either by Nor I-IT-KNOW WHO HE-HIM-KILLING
     NOT   I-WHOM-KNOW            HE-HIM-KILLING.         Subordinate     constructions

 Not infrequently an adverb is to be considered the main predicate,
articularly when supported by the unanalyzable but probably
erbal form wala’‘si(na‘), while the main verb follows as a subordi-
ate clause.     Compare such English turns as IT Is HERE THAT I SAW
IM, instead of HERE      I SAW HIM:
     eme® (1) wala’‘st (2) ett‘e*da® (3) I am (8) right (2) here (1)
        (literally, here it-is really [ ?] that-I-am)

       fixed it for him (literally, already (1) it-was-really (2) that-
       he-had-fixed-it-for-him (3))
xxamples of subordidates depending on predicatively used adverbs
rithout wala’‘si are:
    a/nt (1) wand (2) eme® (3) né’cdat (4) [it is] not (1) even (2) here
       (3) that they did (4) (probably=even they did not get here)

        ago (long ago [1] that snow [2] almost [3] stormed [4])
     alt (1) he&-i-leme’klinda® (2) it is] right here (1) that I destroy

m example of a subordinate depending on a demonstrative pro-
oun is:
    vdaga (1) yapla (2) s‘asinit‘a® (3) that man is standing (literally,
        {it is] that [1] man [2] that is standing [3])
 The form wala’‘sina® is in all probability a third personal aorist
ransitive subordinate form in -na‘, as is shown by its use as a sub-
tantive verb for the third person when following an adverb, appar-
ntly to supply the lack of a third person in the regular substantive
‘erb ev-:
     eme® (1) wala‘sina® (2) a/k!a (3) he (3) is right (2) here (1)

196                 BUREAU   OF AMERICAN      ETHNOLOGY             (BULL.40Most astonishing is the use of wala’sina* as a modal prefix of s
subordinate verb (of the movable        class treated above, see § 34) to
assert the truth of an action in the manner of our English pp in
sentences like HE DID Go. Thus, from dak‘-da-halsbi HE ANSWERED
you, is formed the emphatic dak‘-da-wala’sina‘-halsbina® HE DD
ANSWER rou. The only analysis of this form that seems possible
is to consider the verbal prefixes dak‘-da- as a predicative adverb upon
which wala’‘sina‘ is syntactically dependent, the main verb -halsbina
itself depending as a subordinate clause on its modal prefix.           The
fact that dak‘-da- has as good as no concrete independent existence ss
adverb, but is idiomatically used with the verbal base hal- to make
up the idea of ANSWER, is really no reason for rejecting this analysis,
strange as it may appear, for the mere grammatical form of a sen-
tence need have no immediate connection with its logical dismenm-
berment. The above form might be literally translated as (1 1s)

                           § 71. CONDITIONALS  Conditionals differ from other subordinate forms in that they are
derived, not from the full verb-form with its subject-affix, but,if
intransitive, directly from the verb-stem; if transitive, from the verb
stem with incorporated pronominal object. In other words, the con-
ditional suffix -k‘i* gi‘) is added to the same phonetic verbal units
as appear in the inferential before the characteristic -k‘, and in the
periphrastic future before the second element -gulug’-. The phonetic
and to some extent psychologic similarity between the inferential
(e. g., dimaik’ HE EVIDENTLY STRUCK ME) and the conditional (e. g,
dimazigi® Ir HE STRIKES, HAD STRUCK ME) makes it not improbable
that the latter is a derivative in -2* of the third personal subjective
form in -k‘ of the latter. The conditional, differing again from other
subordinates in this respect, shows no variation for pronominal sub
jects, the first and second personal subjective forms being periphras-
tically expressed by the addition to the conditional of the third per
sonal subjective of the appropriate forms of e- BE. From verb-sten
yana- Go, for example, are derived:

  The conditional is used not merely, as its name implies, to express
he protasis of a condition, but as the general subordinate form of
realized activity; as such it may often be translated as a temporal
rrelative clause, an introductory adverb or relative pronoun serving
0 give it the desired shade of meaning. Examples of its use other
han as a conditional, in the strict sense of the word, are:

          you to eat (3)                                                              ;

  Conditional sentences are of two types:
   (1) Simple, referring to action of which, though unfulfilled, there
yet remains the possibility of fulfillment.
   (2) Contrary to fact, the hypothetical activity being beyond the
possibility of fulfillment.
   Both types of condition require the conditional form in the protasis,
but differ in the apodosis. The apodosis of a simple conditional sen-
tence contains always a future form (or inferential, if the apodosis is
negative), that of a contrary-to-fact condition, a potential. Examples
of simple conditions are:
       ga (1) na‘nak‘ié ett’ (2) hazada’ (3) if you do (2) that (1), you'll
         get burnt (3)

:h persons other than the third:
     yana’t'e haga‘ I should have gone in that event           §'72. USES     OF   POTENTIAL            AND   INFERENTIALThe potential and inferential modes differ from the aorist in the
zative particle with which they may be combined. An indicative
n-future statement, such as is expressed by the aorist, is negatived,
thout change of the verb-form, by means of the negative adverb
ve:
     yant'e® I went; a’ni* yant‘e® I did not go
1 imperative or future form, however, can not be directly negatived,
t must be expressed by the potential and inferential respectively,
e non-aoristic negative adverb wede being prefixed.                 Thus we have:
gative future:
  yana''t' he will go                :       wede yana‘k‘ he will not go
  yanada’* you will go              :        wede yana’k!ett' you will not go

                                                      person (3) who is no shaman
                                                      (4) 146.16
egative imperative:
     yana* go! (sing.)                   :   wede yana‘t' do not go!
     yana‘np* go! (pl.)                  :   wede yana‘t'p‘ do not go! (156.9)
     d6“m kill him!                     :    wede do*ma‘t' do not kill him!
     ga na‘na‘ do that!                  :   wede ga na‘na‘t' do not do that!
The particle wede is used with the inferential and potential, not
uy to form the negative future and imperative, but in all cases in
hich these modes are negatived, e. g., wede d6“ma’/'n I SHOULD NOT
AVE KILLED HIM, I WOULD NOT KILL HIM. There is thus no morpho-
gic distinction between a prohibitive Do Not Go! and asecond person
ibject negative apodosis of a contrary-to-fact condition, You WOULD
OT HAVE GONE.         It is probably not a mere accident that the negative
article wedeis phonetically identical with the verb-stem wede- TAKE
way. ‘This plausible etymology of wede suggests that the origin of
                                                                            § 72

phrastic sentences as:                                            |
      Remove      (all thought from your mind) that I (inferentially) e0
          (i. e., I shall not go)
      Remove      (all thought      from your mind)           that you       might, would
          go (i. e., do not go!)
  The inferential, as we have seen above (see § 59), is used primarily
to indicate that the action is not directly known through persona
experience. An excellent example of how such a shade of meaning
can be imparted even to a form of the first person singular was given
in § 70; s°*i!-k‘we'*xit ulum watk‘anda’ THEY WOKE ME UP WHILEI
WAS SLEEPING! 74.5 In the myth from which this sentence is taken,
Coyote is represented as suffering death in the attempt to carry out
one of his foolish pranks.          Ants, however, sting him back into lifes
whereupon Coyote, instead of being duly grateful, angrily exclaims
as above, assuming, to save his self-esteem, that he has really only
been taking an intentional nap. The inferential form watk‘and¢
is used      in preference    to the matter-of-fact               aorist waydnt‘e‘da't
SLEEPING, because of the implied inference, I WASN’T DEAD, AFTER ALL,
ELSE HOW COULD THEY WAKE ME? I WAS REALLY SLEEPING, MUST
HAVE BEEN SLEEPING. Closely akin to this primary use of tha
inferential is its frequent use in rhetorical questions of anger, sur
prise, wonder, and discovery of fact after ignorance of it for so
time. Examples from the myths, where the context gives hal
the necessary psychological setting, are:
      geme    i (1) gi* (2) wayatzagwat'            (3) yu'k‘a® (4) how (1) shoul)

  A peculiar Takelma idiom is the interrogative use of gwi'ne WHEN,
HOW LONG followed by wede and the inferential, to denote a series of
repetitions or an unbroken continuity of action. Examples are:
        gwitne (1) de’ (2) wede (3) watk’ (4) he kept on sleeping
           (literally, when [1] did he not [3] sleep [4] #[2]) 142.11; 152.24

           they always stumbled upon him again (literally, when [1] was

  Similar psychologically is the non-negative future in:
        ge’me'di (1) hono® (2) al-da*gi‘nk’ (3) they never found him
           again (lit., when [1] will they find him [3] again?[2]) 190.25    6. Nominal         and    Adjectival      Derivatives    (§§ 73-83)
                             § 73. INTRODUCTORY
   Although such derivatives from the verb-stem as infinitives and
nouns of agency should logically be treated under the denominating
rather than the predicative forms of speech, they age in Takelma, as
in most other languages, so closely connected as regards morphology
with the latter, that it is much more convenient to treat them imme-
diately after the predicative verb-forms.           The number of nominal
and adjectival      forms    derived   from   the Takelma   verb-stem   is not
very large, comprising infinitives or verbal nouns of action, active
and passive participles, nouns of agency, and a few other forms whose
function is somewhat less transparent. The use made of them, how-
ever, is rather considerable, and they not infrequently play an
important part in the expression of subordinate verbal ideas.
                           § 74. INFINITIVES
   Infinitives, or, as they are perhaps better termed, verbal nouns,
may be formed from all verbs by the addition of certain suffixes to
the stem or stem + pronominal object, if the verb form is transitive.
                                                           § 73-74
      ~202                    BUREAU     OF AMERICAN       ETHNOLOGY                  [BuLy.40 |Inasmuch as infinitives, being nothing but nouns in form, may take
possessive affixes, forms may easily result that combine a transitive
object and a possessive pronoun; e. g., démabiyat'k’ my (-t‘k‘ scheme
ur § 92) KILLING you (-bi-), FOR ME TO KILL rou (cf. yéxbiyaadek'
MY BITING you 116.9; -x-dek scheme 1 § 92). The classification of
verbs into classes is reflected also in the infinitive forms, each of the
three main classes being distinguished by a special infinitive suffix. |
The suffixes are:
  Intransitive I -(a‘)z.
  Intransitive ITI -k‘wa (-gwa).
  Transitive -ta (-ya).
  The peculiar sub-classes that were grouped together as Class IV
all form their infinitives in -k‘wa (-gwa). Besides these three main
suffixes, -(d)epz- (-apz-) with possessive suffixes is employed to form
infinitives from reflexives in -gwi-, while active intransitives in -za-
form their infinitives by employing the bare stem-form with verbal
derivative -za. Infinitives in -za’k‘wa also occur. The infinitive |
often shows the stem in a purer form than the non-aorist finite
forms; in particular the non-aoristic -p‘- of Class II intransitive verbs
regularly disappears before the -gwa of the infinitive.
   Examples of infinitives are:
1. From Class I intransitives:
          watcde® your sleeping                    yana‘z to go
          ba?-dawi‘z to fly up                    hoida‘z to dance

considerable freedom from ali verbs. They have not been found wit
incorporated pronominal objects, the active participles being mot
adjectival than verbal in character, while the passives naturally hard
allow of their incorporation. The passive participle is often provide
with possessive affixes that correspond to the transitive subjects «
the finite verb; the active participle, on the other hand, undergoe
no modification for person, but, like any adjective, is brought in cot
nection with a particular person by the forms of the copula ¢7- BE.
                           § 76. Active Participle in -f  This participle is formed by simply appending a -t‘, one of th
characteristic adjectival suffixes, to the verb-stem.              Inferential an
imperative -p‘- of Class II intransitives disappears before this ele
ment (e. g., se’nsant' WHOOPING), but not the non-aoristic -p‘-, whic
is characteristic (see § 42, 1) of some of the verbs of the same clas
e. g., sana‘p’ FicuT'NG (from *sana‘p‘t'). Participles in -é* neve
denote particular action, but regularly indicate that the action pred

at may serve as a characteristic attribute. Not infrequently, there-
re, a -t'- participle has the value of a noun of agency; the fact, how-
‘er, that it never appears with pronominal elements, but is always
eated as an adjective, demonstrates its attributive, non-substantival
‘aracter. It is possible to use it with a preceding nominal object,
' that sentences may result that seem to predicate a single act
finitely placed in time; yet an attributive shade of meaning always
mains. For example, wihin démt' eit‘e® (literally, MY-MOTHER HAV-
(G-KILLED I-AM) and wihin tlomoma’'n both mean I KILLED MY
OTHER, but with a difference. The latter sentence simply states
ie fact, the emphasis being on the act itself; the former sentence,
1 the other hand, centers in the description of the subject as a matri-
de,    I AM ONE WHO HAS KILLED HIS MOTHER.                 The latter sentence
ight be a reply to a query like wHaT DID you po? the former, to .

 Nominal participial forms in -k‘”of passive signification can be freely
wrmed from all transitive verb-stems, the stem invariably undergoing
alatalization (see § 31). The suffix -k‘” ordinarily requires a pre-
eding connective -a- replaced, as usual, by an instrumental ~- in
uch passive participles as are derived from verb-forms themselves
rovided with -i-.       Participles in -ak‘“ tend to be accented on the
                                                                          § 77

  -h- generally appears before the -a-; -hak‘” is also regularly used witl
  preceding fortis (see § 19). It isnot unlikely that the suffix is organ
  ically -hak'”, the -ha- implying continuity (see § 43,5).   Instrumenta
  passives in -2k‘“, on the other hand, are generally accented, with raise
  pitch, on the ~i- of the suffix.                   For example, damhak‘¥                  (a.ways
  KILLED Or STRUCK PERSON, but wa-dii“mi‘k'” THING WITH WHICH ON
  KILLS (literally, KILLED-wirH thing). Inasmuch as -k‘¥- participles
  differing in this respect from active participles in -¢’, are distinctly nom
  inal in character, they may be provided with possessive suffixes; e. g.
  damhak‘’-dek‘ My STRUCK ONE. Forms thus arise which, like -¢'-par
  ticiples supplemented by forms of ¢- Bz, have independent predicativ
  force. What we have seen to apply to -¢‘-participles, however, i
  regard to particularity of action, applies with equal if not greater fore
. to predicatively used passives in -k‘¥. While a sentence like 7’dag
  tlomoma’'n (dimk‘am) THAT ONE WAS SLAIN, with finite passiv
  implies the fulfillment of a single act, a sentence whose predicate i
  supplied by a passive participle (like v’daga damhak‘’” THaT ONE!
 [REGULARLY] SLAIN, STRUCK) necessarily refers to habitual or regular!
 continued activity: 7’daga damhak‘“de‘k‘ THAT ONE IS MY (REGl
  LARLY) STRUCK ONE thus approaches in signification the finit

  but differs radically in signification from both tdaga t!omoma""
  I KILLED THAT ONE and ?’daga démt' ett‘e® 1 AM ONE THAT HAS KILLE

  The -d- of the indirect object never appears in its naked form
(except, as we have seen, in certain forms in -gwad-; see also under
-d- in petrified suffixes), but always combined into -s- with the follow-
ing element -z- that serves to bind pronominal objects of the first and
second persons to the verb-stem with its derivative suffixes (see §64).
The indirect object of the third person is not normally expressed by
this -d-, but, like an ordinary direct third personal object, is left
unexpressed, the general character of the verb being impliedly indi-
rective. As a matter of fact, an incorporated pronominal indirect
object is used only when the direct object is of the third person, never
of the first or second; and, since the pronominal object of the third
person is never expressed in the verb, this means that what is trans-
lated as the indirect object is in reality morphologically the direct
object of the verb.               The    indirective idea is merely                    a derivative
development; or, more correctly, certain transitive verbs with indi-
rective “‘ face’’ require dn -s- (=-d-+-2-) instead of -z- with an incor-
porated object of the first or second person. 1 GIVE IT TO HIM is, then,
really rendered in Takelma by I-HIM-GIVE; I GIVE IT TO YOU, by 1-

logically indirect object arm must be looked upon as the direct object
of the verbal complex Froop-GIvE (FooD, not being a pronominal

FOOD, by I-YOU-FOOD-GIVE, the pronominal combination 1 You
being expressed at the end of the verb-complex in the same form as in
a simple transitive like 1-You-sEE, except that it is preceded by -s-
instead of -z-; such combinations as I GIVE YOU TO HIM, ME and HE
GIVES ME TO YOU, HIM can not be expressed by one verb-form. In
these latter cases the grammatical object of the verb is no longer in-
directly affected by the action; hence another, though probably ety-
mologically related, verb-stem is employed, while the indirect object
is expressed by a local phrase outside the verb: I GIVE YOU TO HIM
(=1-YoU-GIVE [not indirective ‘‘face’’] HIM-TO), -x-, not -s-, preced-
ing the combination 1 you.    The idea of To in intransitives like co,

  This suffix is probably composed of the continuative -l- (see § 42, 9)
ind the indirective -d-, though, unlike the latter suffix, it is always
mployed to transitivize intransitives, a characteristic intransitive
‘lement of the aorist (e. g., -i-) regularly remaining.               After vowels, the
wuffix appears simply as -ld-; after consonants and semivowels, a con-
iective -a- is generally introduced, which, when accented, receives a
‘alling pitch.     The general idea conveyed               by the suffix is that of
ourposive action toward some person or object, so that it may be con-
veniently translated by MOVING AT or TOWARD, IN ORDER TO REACH,
WOING TO GET.       Examples of its use are:

                           § 49. Indirective -(a’)md-
  There hardly seems to be any significant difference between this
and the preceding suffix, except that the indirective force of -(a’)md-
seems in many cases to be much less clear and that it may be appended
to transitive as well as to intransitive stems.             It is quite probable
that in some of the examples the -m- of the suffix is really the dissimi-
lated product of an original -l- because of an -l- of the stem (see § 21);
yet this explanation could not be made to apply to all the cases.
Those forms that contain a radical -l- are given first:

                            §50.   Indirective -(a)n(an)- ‘‘for’’  From transitives, never from intransitives, are formed verbs in
-(a)n or -(a)nan- (the first -a- is the connective vowel already spoken
of) signifying To po (the act expressed by the verb-stem) FoR, IN
BEHALF OF (the object of the verb). No rule can be given as to when
-(a)n- or -(a)nan- is to be used, the two suffixes being frequently
found to interchange in the same form.  It is not likely that -(a)nan-
is a mere duplication of the simpler -(a)n-, as no other case of suffix-
reduplication could be shown to exist in Takelma, but rather a
compound suffix consisting of two distinct elements that happen to be
homonymous.            Neither of the -(a)n- elements           in-(a)nan-, however,
can be identified with either the causative -(a)n- or the petrified -(a)n-
of certain transitive verbs (see § 42,10), for the full -(@)nan- suffix is
found    suffixed      to them        (e. g., lohd“ninini’'n         I KILLED HIM FOR
Him [ =I CAUSED HIM TO DIE FOR HIM]).                   As in the case of the ordi-
nary indirect object-suffix -s-, only the third person (and that, as far as
the pronoun is concerned, by implication) is tolerated as the logical
object, the grammatical object being always the. person in whose
behalf the action is done.      If the formal (i. e., indirect) object of
the verb is of the third person, the -(a)n- or -(a)nan- is nearly always
followed by the “instrumental” i (see § 64), an umlaut of the suffix
to -(i)n- or -(i)nin- necessarily resulting (see § 8, 3c). The longer
form of the suffix -(a)nan is apt to be limited to the aorist forms
with third personal object; non-aorist forms and aorist forms with
first or second personal object generally have the shorter form of the
suffix, -(a)n-. What was said above of a phonetic character in regard
to the causative -(a)n- applies also here. Examples are:
                    Transitive                                      Indirective                                                     wa‘-i-tloxdziniin   I    gather

i not infrequently happens in verbs where the logical relation exist-
g between the subject and a first or second personal object can
ardly be other than an indirect one, that the ror idea is expressed
y means of the simple transitive form with -z- or -s- instead of
ie more explicit indirective -(a)n(an)-, as shown in the following
camples:
   kledétsi he picks them for me (literally,he picks to me, along-
      side of k!/edeya’nzi he picks them for me)?                  i
   mebép‘'xip’ come and chop out (a hole) for me (to enable me to
      get out) (literally, come and chop me!) 90.16
      gel-ts!eye'mxi he hid it from me (158.7);                       but gel-ts!ayamini’'n I
        hid it from him
 The idea of DOING SOMETHING FOR SOME ONE when the action is an
itransitive one can not be expressed in the verb itself, so that peri-
hrases of one kind or another are resorted to; e. g., I GO FOR HIM is
cpressed by I GO, HE HAVING SENT ME.                           In verbs that are intransi-
ve only in form, but logically still transitive, that is, in transitive
erbs with unexpressed object, the ror idea is expressed by the com-
lex suffix -gwa’dan- (with first or second personal object -gwas-), the
nalysis of which has been attempted above (see § 46).                                        Thus we
ave (p/iyin) 10’“gin(in)i*n 1 TRAP (DEER) FOR HIM built up on a tran-
tive in both form and meaning (i. e., 16’/“ga'n), but lik li’zagwa-
ini*n I TRAP FOR HIM built up on a formal intransitive (lik/ii’za‘).
the idea of FoR, IN BEHALF OF ONE’S SELF is rendered in transitive
erbs by adding to the indirective suffix -(a)n(an)- the regular reflexive
affix -k‘wi- (-gwi-):
     do“mana’nk‘wida* he will kill them for himself
     thimak'wank‘wide® I kill them for myself
      de*i-wi'*gank‘wide® I spread it out for myself
      han-se‘gwa’nk'wide‘ I paddle myself across, really, I paddle (canoe)
        across for myself
1There must be a difference in signification, however, between k/edéisi and k/edeya’nzi.   The former
‘obably means “he picks them for me, i. e., in order to give them to me;’’ the latter ‘‘he picks them
. my behalf (perhaps because I am sick and can not do so myself.)’’   Compare also de‘tse’eri HE OPENED
JE DOOR FOR ME (i.¢., inorder to let me in) (63.12) with de‘tse’eganzi HE OPENED       THE   DOOR ON MY
EHALF (perhaps because I was unable to do so myself).","[146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153]"

       °                   OREGON                         By   Epwarp    Sapir
                       § 1. INTRODUCTION  The language treated in the following pages was spoken in the
southwestern part of what is now the state of Oregon, along the
middle portion of Rogue river and certain of its tributaries. It,
together with an upland dialect of which but a few words were
obtained, forms the Takilman stock of Powell.     The form ‘“Takelma”
of the word is practically identical with the native name of the tribe,
Da*gelma’'n THOSE DWELLING ALONG THE RIVER (see below, § 87, 4);
there seems to be no good reason for departing from it in favor of
Powell’s variant form.
  The linguistic material on which this account of the Takelma
language is based consists of a series of myth and other texts, pub-
lished by the University of    Pennsylvania     (Sapir, Takelma   Texts,
Anthropological Publications of the University Museum, vol. 1, no. 1,
Philadelphia, 1909), together with a mass       of grammatical material
(forms and sentences) obtained in connection with the texts. A
series of eleven short medicine formulas or charms have been pub-
lished with interlinear and free translation in the Journal of Ameri-
can Folk-Lore (xx, 35-40). A vocabulary of Takelma verb, noun,
and adjective stems, together with a certain number of derivatives,
will be found at the end of the “Takelma Texts.”      Some manu-
script notes on Takelma, collected in the summer of 1904 by Mr.
H. H. St. Clair, 2d, for the Bureau of American Ethnology, have
been kindly put at my disposal by the Bureau; though these consist
mainly of lexical material, they have been found useful on one or
two points. References like 125.3 refer to page and line of my |
Takelma Texts. Those in parentheses refer to forms analogous to
the ones discussed.

Oregon during a stay of a month and a half in the summer of 1906,
also under the direction of the Bureau of American Ethnology.
My informant was Mrs. Frances Johnson, an elderly full-blood
Takelma woman. Her native place was the village of Dak‘ts/asii or
Daldani‘k‘, on           Jump-off-Joe creek (Dip! olis!i’lda), a northern affluent
of Rogue river, her mother having come from a village on the upper
course of Cow creek (Hagwal). Despite her imperfect command of
the English language, she was found an exceptionally intelligent
and good-humored informant, without which qualities the following
study would have been far more imperfect than it necessarily must
be under even the very best of circumstances.
   In conclusion I must thank Prof. Franz Boas for his valuable
advice in regard to several points of method and for his active
interest in the progress of the work.                         It is due largely to him that I
was encouraged to depart from the ordinary rut of grammatical
description and to arrange and interpret the facts in a manner that
seemed most in accordance with the spirit of the Takelma language
itself.
                                  PHONOLOGY                   (§§ 2-24)                                        § 2. Introductory    In its general phonetic character, at least as regards relative harsh-
ness or smoothness of acoustic effect, Takelma will probably be found
to occupy a position about midway between the characteristically
rough languages of the Columbia valley and the North Californian
and Oregon coast (Chinookan, Salish, Alsea, Coos, Athapascan, Yurok)
on the one hand, and the relatively euphonious languages of the
Sacramento valley (Maidu, Yana, Wintun)                                   on the other, inclining
rather to the latter than to the former.
     From the former group it differs chiefly in the absence of voice-
less J-sounds (z, #,? z/) and of velar stops (g, g, q/); from the latter,
    1 What little has been learned of the ethnology of the Takelma Indians will be found incorporated in
two articles written by the author and entitled Notes on the Takelma Indians of Southwestern Oregon, in
American Anthropologist, n. s., 1X, 251-275; and Religious Ideas of the Takelma Indians of Southwestern
Oregon, in Journal of American Folk-Lore, xx, 33-49.
  3 In the myths, ? is freely prefixed to any word spoken by the bear. Its uneuphonious character is evi-
dently intended to      match the coars     of the bear, and for this quasi-rhetorical purpose it was doubtless
derisively borrowed from the neighboring Athapascan languages, in which it occurs with great frequency.
The prefixed sibilant s- serves in a similar way as a sort of sneezing adjunct to indicate the speech of    4h
thecoyote.    Gtoi’di WHERE? says the ordinary mortal; igwi’di, the bear; s-gw#’di, the coyote.

though these are of strictly limited possibilities, and hardly to be
considered as difficult in themselves.
  Like the languages of the latter group, Takelma possesses clear-
cut vowels, and abounds, besides, in long vowels and         diphthongs;
these, together with a system of syllabic pitch-accent, give the Takel-
ma language a decidedly musical character, marred only to some
extent by the profusion of disturbing catches. The line of cleavage
between Takelma and the neighboring dialects of the Athapascan stock
(Upper Umpqua, Applegate Creek, Galice Creek, Chasta Costa) is thus
not only morphologically but also phonetically distinct, despite re-
semblances in the manner of articulation of some of the vowels and
consonants. Chasta Costa, formerly spoken on the lower course of
Rogue river, possesses all the voiceless J-sounds above referred to;
peculiar illusive g/, the fortis character of which is hardly as prominent
as in Chinook; a voiced guttural spirant 7, as in North German Tage;
the sonants or weak surds dj and 2 (rarely); a voiceless interdental
spirant ¢ and its corresponding fortis t¢/; and a very frequently oc-
curring @ vowel, as in English nut.       All of these are absent from
Takelma, which, in turn, has a complete labial series '(b, p‘, p!, m),
whereas Chasta Costa has only the nasal m (labial stops occur appar-
ently only in borrowed words, bé¢i’ cat <pussy). The fortis k!,com-
mon in Takelma, seems in the Chasta Costa to be replaced by g/; the
Takelma vowel ii, found also in California, is absent from Chasta
Costa; 7 is foreign to either, though found in Galice Creek and Shasta.
Perhaps the greatest point of phonetic difference, however, between
the Takelma and Chasta Costa languages lies in the peculiar long
(doubled) consonants of the latter, while Takelma regularly simpli-
fies consonant geminations that would theoretically appear in the
building of words. Not enough of the Shasta has been published to
enable one to form an estimate of the degree of phonetic similarity
that obtains between it and Takelma, but the differences can hardly
be as pronounced as those that have just been found to exist in the
case of the latter and Chasta Costa.
    This preliminary survey seemed necessary in order to show, as far
as the scanty means at present at our disposal would allow, the
ponetic affiliations of Takelma. Attention will now be directed to
the sounds themselves.
                                                                    § 2

                      § 3.   General Remarks   The simple vowels appear, quantitatively considered, in two
forms, short and long, or, to adopt a not inappropriate term, pseudo-
diphthongal. . By this is meant that a long vowel normally con-
sists of the corresponding short vowel, though generally of greater
quantity, plus a slight parasitic rearticulation of the same vowel
(indicated by a small superior letter), the whole giving the effect of a
diphthong without material change of vowel-quality in the course
of production. The term PSEUDO-DIPHTHONG is the more justified
in that the long vowel has the same absolute quantity, and experi-
ences the same accentual and syllabic treatment, as the true diph-
thong, consisting of short vowel + 7, u, l, m, or n. If the short
vowel be given a unitary quantitative value of 1, the long vowel
(pseudo-diphthong) and ordinary diphthong will have an approxi-
mate value of 2; while the long diphthong, consisting of long vowel
+ i, u, 1, m, or n, will be assigned a value of 3. The liquid (2) and
the nasals (m and n) are best considered as forming,     parallel to the
semi-vowels y (2) and w (u), diphthongs with preceding           vowels,
inasmuch as the combinations thus entered on are treated, similarly
to i- and u- diphthongs, as phonetic units for the purposes of pitch-
accent and grammatic processes. As a preliminary example serving
to justify this treatment, it may be noted that the verb-stem bilw-,
bilu- suMP becomes bilau- with inorganic a under exactly the same
phonetic conditions as those which make of the stem k/emn- MAKE
k!leman-. We thus have, for instance:
     bilwa’‘s jumper; bila‘uk* he jumped
     klemna’'s maker; k!ema‘nk‘ he made it
From this and numberless other examples it follows that au and an,
similarly a2, al, and am, belong, from 4 strictly Takelma point of
view, to the same series of phonetic elements; similarly for e, i, 0,
and # diphthongs.
                      § 4. System      of Vowels
   The three quantitative stages outlined above are presented for
the various vowels and diphthong-forming elements in the following
table:

   It is to be understood, of course, that, under proper syllabic con-                                                 ;
ditions, 7 and u may respectively appear                                         in semivocalic form as y             ©
and w; thus 6” and % appear as dw and ww when followed by vowels;
e. g., in k/iwii""- THROW AWAY, tw and i are equivalent elements
forming a reduplicated complex entirely analogous to -elel- in helel-
sing.  Similarly ai, au, di, and Gu may appear as ay, aw, Gy, and
d*w; and correspondingly for the other vowels.     Indeed, one of
the best criteria for the determination of the length of the first
element of a diphthong is to obtain it in such form as would cause
the second element (i or u) to become semi-vocalic, for then the first
vowel will adopt the form of a short vowel or pseudo-diphthong,
as the case may be. The following phonetic (not morphologic) pro-
portions will make this clearer:
        biliut'e® I jump: biliwa't‘ you jump=heiu he went away from
           him: he“i'wi’¢n I went away from him
        gaik* he ate it: gayawa’‘n I ate it=gaik’ he grew: gatya’t he will
                 Ow
        gayan he ate it: gayawa’'nI ate it = hant‘gau over land: Latg‘a*wa’‘
       one from Lat‘giu [uplands]
Sometimes, though not commonly, a diphthong may appear in the
same word either with a semivowel or vowel as its second element,
according to whether it is or is not followed by a connecting inor-.
ganic a. A good example of such a doublet is haye*wa’sdé*da or
hayéuzdi*da IN HIS RETURNING (verb stem yéu-, ye°w- RETURN).
It is acoustically difficult to distinguish sharply between the long
vowel or pseudo-diphthong 6"" and the u-diphthongs of o (both ou
and 6u are often heard as 6”), yet there is no doubt that there is
an organic difference between 6"", as long vowel to 0, and 6“=ou, du.
Thus, in lohé""na’*n I CAUSE HIM TO DIE, and lohona’n I SHALL CAUSE
HIM TO DIE, 6“ and o are related as long and short vowel in parallel
                                                                                                               § 4

Go. On the other hand, the 6"" of p‘d""p‘au- (aorist stem) BLOW is
organically a diphthong (du), the 6"" of the first syllable being related
to the aw of the second as the iu of k‘wk‘au- (verb stem) BRANDISH
is to its au. Similarly, the -6%- of s6’""k‘dép'- (verb stem) sUMP
is organic shortened ou, related to the -owo- of the aorist stem
s'o’wo'k' 6p‘- as the -e'- of he’!*z- (verb stem) BE LEFT OVER is to the
-eye- of heye‘s- (aorist stem).   A similar acoustic difficulty is experi-
enced in distinguishing i#, (i) as long vowel from the w- diphthongs
of ti, (%).
   Examples of unrelated stems and words differing only in the
length of the vowel or diphthong are not rare, and serve as internal
evidence of the correctness, from a native point of view, of the vowel
classification made:
     gai- eat, but gai- grow
     verb-prefix da?- ear, but da- mouth
     wé*ra his younger brother, but wa’za at them
It may happen that two distinct forms of the same word differ only
in vocalic quantity; ya*da’*t‘ HE WILL swiM, yada’t' HE SWIMS.
     It is, naturally enough, not to be supposed that the long vowels
and diphthongs always appear in exactly the same quantity.    Speed
of utterance and, to some extent, withdrawal of the stress-accent,
tend to reduce the absolute quantities of the vowels, so that a nor-
mally long vowel can become short, or at least lose its parasitic
attachment. In the case of the 2- and u- diphthongs, such a quan-
titative reduction means that the two vowels forming the diphthong
more completely lose their separate individuality and melt into one.
Quantitative reduction is apt to occur particularly before a glottal
catch; in the diphthongs the catch follows so rapidly upon the second
element (i or u) that one can easily be in doubt as to whether a full
i- or u- vowel is pronounced, or whether this second vowel appears
rather as a palatal or labial articulation of the catch itself. The
practice has been adopted of writing such diphthongs with a superior
4 or u before the catch: a, a“, e“*, and similarly for the rest. When,
however, in the course of word-formation, this catch drops off, the 7
or u that has been swallowed up, as it were, in the catch reasserts
itself, and we get such pairs of forms as:
       naga’® he said; but naga’ida® when he said
       sgele’""* he shouted; but sgele’uda‘ when he shouted

when dwelt upon for rhetorical emphasis.  Thus ga THAT sometimes
appears as ga:
       ga* loho’t‘e® in that case I shall die
       ga’* ga‘a‘l for that reason
    As regards the pronunciation of the vowels themselves, little need
‘besaid. The a is of the same quality as the short a of German MANN,
 while the long a (barring the parasitic element) corresponds to the
a of HAHN.
  A labial coloring of the a (i. e., 6 as in German VoLL) frequently
occurs before and after k‘”:
     gahok’” planted, sown
        tk'wa'*k'wék* he woke him up
But there were also heard:
    sek‘ak‘” shot
    malakwa he told him
   The ¢ is an open sound, as in the English LET; it is so open, indeed,
as to verge, particularly after y, toward a.! Also the long vowel e¢
is very open in quality, being pronounced approximately like the e7
of English THEIR              (but of course without            the r- vanish)         or the é of
French rére; e¢, though unprovided with the mark of length, will
be always understood as denoting the long vowel (pseudo-diphthong)
corresponding to the short e; while é will be employed, wherever
necessary, for the long vowel without the parasitic --.                               The close é,
as in German REH, does not seem to occur in Takelma, although it
was sometimes heard for 7; in the words 1a%/é‘ HE BECAME, la4lét‘am
YOU BECAME, and other related forms, é was generally heard, and may
be justified, though there can be small doubt that it is morphologically
identical with the 7 of certain other verbs.
   The 2 is of about the same quality as in English uit, while the
long 7 is closer, corresponding to the ea of English Brat.                                   Several
 monosyllables, however, in -2, such as gw? WHERE, di interrogative
 particle, should be pronounced with a close though short vowel (cf.
French Fint). This closer pronunciation of the short vowel may be
explained by supposing that gwi, di, and other such words are rapid
 pronunciations of gwi‘, di‘, and the others;                          and    indeed the texts
 sometimes show such longer forms.
   1The word yewe’ i HE RETURNED, é. g., was long heard as yawe’ ‘€, but such forms as y2u RETURN! show
 this to have been an auditory error.
                                                                                               § 4
14                  BUREAU    OF AMERICAN     ETHNOLOGY            [poxr. 40     The o is a close vowel, as in German sou, as far as the quality is
concerned, but with the short quantity of the oof voLt. This close-
ness of pronunciation of the o readily explains its very frequent
interchange with u:
     its lo’p‘al sharp-clawed
       dets' !ugu‘t’ sharp-pointed
and also the u- quality of the parasitic element in the long close vowel
6“. The short open 6, as in German VOLL, never occurs as & primary
vowel, but is practically always a labialized variant of a. Thus in
Takelma, contrary to the parallelism one ordinarily expects to find in
vocalic systems, e- vowels are open in quality, while o- vowels are
close.
 _ The vowel @ is close, as in the English word rubs, the long mark
over the u being here used to indicate closeness of quality rather
than length of quantity. The # is not identical with the German i,
but is somewhat more obscure in quality and wavers (to an un-
Indian ear) between the German short i of Mirze and u of Muss;
sometimes it was even heard with the approximate quality of the
short 6 of G6rz.     The long i* is, in the same way, not exactly
equivalent to the long i of the German siss, but tends in the direc-
tion of &”, with which it frequently varies in the texts.      It is some-
what doubtful how far the two vowels % and # are to be considered
separate and distinct; it is quite possible that they should be looked
upon as auditory variants of one sound.        Before or after y or w, % is |
apt to be heard as @,                kliwit'® THEY RAN AWAY, diyi’§s' HE
LAUGHED, igiiyiigt'‘si, HE KEEPS NUDGING ME,      —— otherwise often as u.     _
     The only short vowel not provided for in the table is @ (as in Eng-
lish sun), which, however, has no separate individuality of its own,
but is simply a variant form of a, heard chiefly before m:
       hetile’mefztm he killed us off (for -am)
       zam in water (for zam)
     The absence    of the obscure vowel x of indeterminate     quality is
noteworthy as showing indirectly the clear-cut vocalic character of
Takelma speech. Only in a very few cases was the z heard, and in
the majority of these it was not a reduced vowel, but an intrusive
sound between m and s:
     dak't'be’«k't‘bagamzs he tied his hair up into top-knot (in place
       of -ams).
   § 4
Boas)         HANDBOOK    OF   INDIAN    LANGUAGES—TAKELMA            15Even here it may really have been the strongly sonantic quality
of the m in contrast to the voiceless s that produced the acoustic
effect of an obscure vowel. The exact pronunciation of the diph-
thongs will be better understood when we consider the subject of
pitch-accent.
                     § 5. Stress   and    Pitch-Accent   Inasmuch as pitch and stress accent are phonetic phenomena that
affect more particularly the vowels and diphthongs, it seems advisable
to consider the subject here and to let the treatment of the conso-
nants follow.     As in many Indian languages, the stress-accent of any
particular word in Takelma is not so inseparably associated with any
particular syllable but that the same word, especially if consisting
of more than two syllables, may appear with the main stress-accent
now on one, now on the other syllable. In the uninterrupted flow of
the sentence it becomes often difficult to decide which syllable of a
word should be assigned the stress-accent. Often, if the word bears
no particular logical or rhythmic emphasis, one does best to regard
it as entirely without accent and as standing in a proclitic or enclitic
relation to a following or preceding word of greater emphasis. This
is naturally chiefly the case with adverbs (such as he‘ne THEN) and
conjunctive particles (such as ganéhi® AND THEN; agas‘i§ AND SO, BUT
THEN); though it not infrequently happens that the major part of
a clause will thus be strung along without decided stress-accent until
some emphatic noun or verb-form is reached. Thus the following
passage occurs in one of the myths:
        ganéhit dewenza 1a°lé hono® p‘ele’za‘, literally translated, And
           then to-morrow (next day) it became, again they went out to
         war
 All that precedes the main verb-form p‘ele’za' THEY WENT OUT TO
 wk is relatively unimportant, and hence is hurried over without any-
 where receiving marked stress.
    Nevertheless a fully accented word is normally stressed on some
 particular syllable; it may even happen that two forms differ
 merely in the place of accent:
      naga’~ida* when he said, but
      naga-da’* when you said
_ The important point to observe, however, is that when a particular
 syllable does receive the stress (and after all most words are normally

inflections:                                                                           ,
   (1) A simple pitch distinctly higher than the normal                pitch of
unstressed speech (=).
   (2) A rising inflection that starts at, or a trifle above, the normal
pitch, and gradually slides up to the same higher pitch referred to
above (=).                                                              -
   (3) A falling inflection that starts at, or generally somewhat
higher than, the raised pitch of (1) and (2), and gradually slides
down to fall either in the same or immediately following syllable, to
a pitch somewhat lower than the normal (+).
   The “raised” pitch (+) is employed only in the case of final short
vowels or shortened diphthongs (i. e., diphthongs that, owing to
speed of utterance, are pronounced so rapidly as to have a quanti-
tative value hardly greater than that of short vowels; also sec-
ondary   diphthongs involving an inorganic a); if a short vowel ©
spoken   on a raised pitch be immediately followed by an unac-
cented   syllable     (as   will    always   happen,   if it is not   the      final
vowel of the word), there will evidently ensue a fall in pitch in the
unaccented syllable, and the general acoustic effect of the two
syllables will be equivalent to a “falling” inflection (+) within one
syllable; i. e. (if — be employed to denote an unaccented syllable),
(\)+—=(¢).         The following illustration will make this clearer:
YoU SAN@ is regularly accented helela‘t', the a‘ being sung on an
interval of a (minor, sometimes even major) third above the two
unaccented e- vowels.    The acoustic effect to an American ear is very
much the same as that of a curt query requiring a positive or nega-
tive answer, DID HE Go? where the 7 of pip and e of HE correspond in
pitch to the two e’s of the Takelma word, while the o of Go is equiva-
lent to the Takelma a‘.              The Takelma word, of course, has no
interrogative connotation.            If, now, we wish to make a question out
of helela‘t‘, we add the interrogative particle di, and obtain the
form helela’t'tdi pip HE SING? (The % is a weak vowel inserted to
keep the ¢ and d apart.) Here the a’ has about the same pitch as
in the preceding word, but the % sinks to about the level of the e-
vowels, and the di is pronounced approximately a third below the —
normal level.       The Takelma interrogative form thus bears an acoustic
resemblance to a rapid English réply: so HE pip Go, the o of so and

Takelma, the 7 of pm resembling in its rise above the normal pitch
the a’, and the o of go sinking like the 7 of the interrogative particle.

  Perhaps the most transparent of all is:
  1. -da‘t’. This element is freely added to personal and demonstra-
ive pronouns, adverbs or verbal prefixes, and local phrases, to
npart the idea of direction from or to, more frequently the former.
1xamples of its occurrence are:
       gi‘da‘t’ in my direction (gt I)
       wadédat‘ from my side (wadé to me)
       ada't* on, to this side 112.17; 144.2

   2. -a. A fairly considerable number of adverbs, chiefly temporal
in signification, are found to end in this element. Such are:
      ho""xa* yesterday 76.9; 98.21
      da-ho""xa‘ this evening 13.3; 16.15; 63.8; 78.4
      dabalni’xa for a long time (cf. bal-s long and lep‘nt’za in winter)
         54.4; 108.16

      (2) da‘ma’xaufar away (forda*- cf. da‘-o'l near) 14.3; 188.21; 190.6
   In lep‘ni‘x 90.6, a doublet of lep‘ni’xa, -xa appears shortened to -z;
this -x may be found also in honéx somE TIME AGo (cf. hono’® aGary).
Here perhaps belongs also da-yawa’nt!i-xi (adjectival?) IN HALF,
ON ONE     SIDE (OF TWO) 94.3.
   It will be noticed that a number of these adverbs are provided|
with the prefix da- (de- before palatal vowels, cf. § 36, 2), the appli
cation of which, however, in their case, can not be explained.
   3. -ne’. A number of adverbs, chiefly those of demonstrative
signification, assume a temporal meaning on the addition of -ne’,s

        k‘a’t hetne bem something like wood 186.11
        k‘ai gwala he’'ne like various things 196.3
 A number of other adverbial suffixes probably occur, but the
xamples are not numerous enough for their certain determination.
{mong them is -ada*:
        nd""gwada‘ some distance down river 54.2 (cf. nd“ down river and
           n6""gwa* down river from 75.14)

partly simple stems and partly unanalyzable derivatives, are listed
here, such as have been already listed under adverbial suffixes not

A noteworthy idiomatic construction of adverbs or phrases of tem-
poral signification is their use as quasi-substantives with forms of

 It is a characteristic trait of Takelma, as of many other American
anguages, that such purely modal ideas as the optative (wouLD
HAT!) and dubitative (I WONDER IF) are expressed by independent
idverbs without modification of the indicative verb-form (cf. further

   By particles are nere meant certain uninflected elements that have
little or no meaning of their own, but that serve either to connect
clauses or to color by some modal               modification the word     to which
they are attached.        They are never met with at the beginning of s
clause or sentence, but occur only postpositively, generally as enclitics.
Some of the elements listed above as modal adverbs (§ 113, 4) might
also be considered as syntactic particles (e. g., wana, ha’ga, nakla',
which never stand at the beginning of a clause); these, however,
show no tendency to be drawn into the verb-complex. Whenever
particles qualify the clause as a whole, rather than any particular
word in the clause, they tend to occupy the second place in the sen-
tence, a tendency that, as we have seen (p. 65), causes them often
to be inserted, but not organically incorporated, into the verb
complex.   The most frequently occurring particles are those listed
below:
1. ya@’* sust.     This   element      is not     dissimilar in meaning     to the
        post-nominal emphasizing -‘a‘ (§ 102), but differs from it in
        that it may be embedded in the verb-form:
      1-ya'*-sge*t'sga‘t’ he just twisted it to one side 31.5
        It only rarely follows a verb-form, however, showing a strong
        tendency to attach itself to denominating terms. Though
        serving generally to emphasize the preceding word, it does not
        seem to involve, like -‘a‘, the idea of a contrast:
      xa*-xo ya’? right among firs (cf. 94.17)
      he'ne ya’* just then, then indeed 63.13; 128.22;          188.1, 18

        It has at times a comparative force:
     gié ya’* na‘nada’* you will be, act, just like me (cf. 196.2)
2. hi. This constantly occurring enclitic is somewhat difficult to
        define.   With personal pronouns it is used as an emphatie
        particle:                   ;
      ma’ hi you yourself (cf. 104.13;          152.20

   ga’ hi just that, the same 64.6; 96.16; 144.3; 190. 31
 In such cases it is rather difficult to draw the line between it
         and y@’,! to which it may be appended:

         As emphasizing particle               it may       even be appended               to    sub-
         ordinate verb forms and to local phrases:
       yant‘ eda‘ hi‘ just as I went (cf. 138.23; 152.5, 7)
       diha-udé hi‘ right behind me, as soon as I had gone
         It may be enclitically               attached        to other       particles, ya’*-ha
         192.1 being a particularly frequent combination:
       gt yaxa’-hi I, however, indeed 71.8
         Its   signification       is not      always, however,            so specific nor its
         force so strong. All that can be said of it in many cases
         is that it mildly calls attention to the preceding word with-
         out, however, specially emphasizing it; often its force is prac-
         tically nil.      This lack of definite signification is well illustrated
         in the following lullaby, in the second line of which it serves
         merely to preserve the rhythm -’-:
       mo’xo wa’inhaé buzzard, put him to sleep!
       si/mhi wa’inha (2) put him to sleep!
       pe'lda wa'inhaé slug, put him to sleep!
 The most important syntactic function of hi is to make a verbal
     prefix an independent word, and thus take it out of its proper
         place in the verb:
       de’-hi ahead (from de- in front) 33.15; 64.3; 196.1;                          198.12

          but:
       ei-han-sak‘” he-canoe-across-paddled 112.9, 18; 114.11
         where han-, as an incorporated local prefix, takes its place after
         the object et. A number of adverbs always appear with suffixed
         hi; e. g., gasa’ThiquicKLy 16.10. Like fa‘, from whichit differs,
         however, in its far greater mobility, hi is never found appended
         to non-subordinate predicative forms. With hi must not be
         confused:
  1 The various shades of emphasis contributed by a’, yd’a, hi, and-s-é¢, respectively,
                                                                                   are well illustrated

       ductory words in the sentence, such as mi‘, gané, and other
       adverbs, and to verb-forms:
      mi'-hié t'aga’* then he returned 62.2; (cf. 188.15)
      gané-hié aba-i-gini’*k‘ and then he went into the house 55.16
      naga’-i-hié = naga’* he said + -hié (see § 22) 22.6; 57.1; 128.15;
        192.9
       As no definite meaning can be assigned to it, and as it is found
        only in myth narration, it is highly probable that it is to be
        interpreted as a quotative:
      ga naga'sa‘n-hié that they said to each other, it is said 27.1, 3; 31.9
  -hié is also found attached to a verbal prefix (22.1; 140.8, 22, 23).
4, -s-4§ AND, BUT.        This is one of the most frequently occurring par-
        ticles in Takelma narration, its main function being to bind
        together two clauses or sentences, particularly when a contrast
        isinvolved.      It is found appended to nouns or pronouns
        deictic or connective suffix:

  An example of its use as sentence connector is:

         used-to-be-said in-my-country long-ago, now-but here not th

  -s'i° is particularly frequently suffixed to the demonstratives ™
        THAT and aga THIS, gas’i® and agas'% serving to connect tn
        sentences, thesecond of which is the temporal or logical resultant
        or antithesis of the second. Both of the connected or con
        trasted sentences may be introduced by gas‘2*, agas‘i®, or by '
        word with enclitically attached -s'i*.      In an antithesis agast
        seems to introduce the nearer, while gas‘i® is used to refer to
        the remoter act. Examples showing the usage of gas‘i‘ and
        agas’i® are:

 gas'i* and agas‘i* as syntactic elements are not to be confused
       with the demonstratives ga and aga to which a connective -s°2
         happens to be attached.          This is shown by:                               ,
       ga-s‘i’* ga‘al that-so for (= so for that reason)
         where ga‘al is a postposition to ga.  There is nothing to pre-
         vent post-nominal -s'7* from appearing in the same clause:

  When suffixed to the otherwise non-occurring demonstrative ‘-

         -hié (see no. 3) or connective -si‘ may be added to ‘4’s""2°, the
         resulting forms, with catch dissimilation (see § 22), being ‘t’s tha
          and ‘i’s""is‘i® 47.11; 148.12. When combined with the idea of
          unfulfilled action, the concessive ‘is""i* is supplemented by the
          conditional form in -k‘i® of the verb:
       *t’si* k'a’t gwala nazbiyauk's*, wede ge liwa't' even-though things
         many they-should-say-to-you (i. e., even though they call you
       names), not there look! 60.3
   Compounded with -s'7‘ is the indefinite particle:
i. -8°é°wa'k'di 64.5. When appended to interrogatives, this parti-
       cle brings about the corresponding indefinite meaning (see
       § 105), but it has also a more general syntactic usage, in
         which capacity it may be translated as PERCHANCE, IT SEEMS,
         PROBABLY:

         success:

         shaft (personified), i. e., spear-shaft almost managed to kil
         him, as he had killed others 28.11; (cf. 188.20)
         A frequent Takelma idiom ig the use of hi‘s with a form of the
         verb of saYING na(g)- to imply a thought or intention on the
         part of the subject of the na(g)- form that fails to be realized:
       “ha-xiya’ mi*wa sga’*t'ap‘de®”’ naga’**-hi‘s ‘“‘in-the-water probably

         Sometimes fis seems to have a usitative signification; prob
         ably the main point implied is that an act once habitual has
         ceased to be so:

      somewhat too strong and definite, its force being often so wesk
      as hardly to allow of an adequate rendering into English. It

boas]             HANDBOOK OF INDIAN LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                  277
          often does not seem to imply more than simple existence or
          action unaccompanied and undisturbed. It is found often
          with the scarcely translatable adverb ganga ONLY, in which
          case the idea of unvaried continuance comes out rather
          strongly, e. g.:
        ga’-hi yaxa ganga naga’** that-indeed continually only he-said
           (i. e., he always kept saying that) 24.15
          From ganga it differs in the fact that it is often attracted into
          the verb-complex:          ;
        ganga ge’l-yaxa-hewe'haw only he-is-continually-thinking (i. ¢., he
           is always thinking) (cf. 128.18; 146.15)
10. wata’'(sina‘) REALLY, COME TO FIND ovT 45.11; 170.8. As
       indicated in the translation, wala’* indicates the more or less
          unexpected resolution of a doubt or state of ignorance:
        ga haga wala’? wilt wat%-t!a/nik* that-one so really house he-kept-
          it (i. e., it was Spear-shaft himself who kept house, no one else)
          28.10
          Certain usages of wala’*si(na‘), evidently an amplification of
          wala’®, have been already discussed (§ 70).
11. dé 1nTERROGATIVE. The interrogative enclitic is consistently
       used in all cases where an interrogative shade of meaning is
       present, whether as applying to a particular word, such as an
       interrogative pronoun or adverb, or to the whole sentence.
       Its use in indirect questions is frequent:
     min t'v’+s mizal di‘ tlomomana’* he-counted gophers how-many
       had-been-killed
       The use of the interrogative is often merely rhetorical, imply-
          ing an emphatic negative:
        k‘a-di’ ma wilt wa'-1-tla’nidaé literally, what you house you-will-
          keep? (=you shall not keep house) 27.16; (cf. 33.1; 47.9)
  Ordinarily di occupies the second place in the sentence, less fre-
quently the third:
        yi'klalade® mi di‘ *a’ni* kat your-teeth now (inter.) not any
           (i. e., have you no teeth?) 128.23
    Besides these syntactically and modally important enclitic par-
ticles, there are a few proclitics of lesser significance. Among these
are to be included mi‘ Now and gané THEN, AND THEN, which, though
they have been included among            the temporal    adverbs   and may
                                                                    § 114

   Of interjections and other words of an emotional character ther,
are quite a number in Takelma.       Some of them, while in no sens
of definite grammatical form, are based on noun or verb stems. Not
a few involve sounds otherwise foreign to the language (e. g., nasal-
ized vowels [expressed by ""], d as in English Bat, @ as in saw, dj 3
in JUDGE, voiceless palatal J [written @], final fortis consonant); pro-
longation of vowels and consonants (expressed by +) and repetition!
of elements are frequently used.
   The material obtained may be classified as follows:
1. Partictes or ADDRESS:
      ama’‘ come on! 96.24
      hene’ away from here! get away!          148.8, 10, 11, 13, 14

  The salient morphologic characteristics of Takelma may be summed
up in the words        INFLECTIVE        and   INCORPORATING,     the chief stress
being laid on either epithet according as one attaches greater impor-
tance to the general method employed in the formation of words and
forms and their resulting inner coherence and unity, or to the par-
ticular grammatical treatment of a special, though for many Ameri-
can languages important, syntactic relation, the object. Outside of
most prefixed elements and a small number of the post-nominal
suffixes, neither of which enter organically into the inner structure
of the word-form, the Takelma word is a firmly knit morphologic
unit built up of a radical base or stem and one or more affixed (gen-
erally suffixed) elements of almost entirely formal, not material,
signification.
   It would be interesting to compare the structure of Takelma with
that of the neighboring languages; but a lack, at the time of writing,
of published       material   on the Kalapuya,       Coos, Shasta, Achomawi,
and Karok makes it necessary to dispense with such comparison.
With the Athapascan dialects of southwest Oregon, the speakers of
which were in close cultural contact with the Takelmas, practically
no agreements of detail are traceable. Both Takelma and Atha-
pascan make        a very extended idiomatic use of a rather large num-
ber of verbal prefixes, but the resemblance is probably not a far-
teaching one. While the Athapascan prefixes are etymologically
distinct from the main body of lexical material            and have       reference
chiefly to position and modes of motion, a very considerable number
of the Takelma prefixes are intimately associated, etymologically
and functionally, with parts of the body.             In the verb the two lan-
Juages     agree in the incorporation of the pronominal subject and
                                                                           § 116
982                    BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY                              (Bout. 40
object,   but   here    again    the     resemblance     is only     superficial.       In
Athapascan the pronominal elements are phonetically closely com-
bined with the verbal prefixes and stand apart from the follow-
ing verb-stem, which never, or very rarely, loses its monosyllabic
individuality. In Takelma the pronominal elements, together with
the derivative affixes, enter into           very    close combination        with the
preceding verb-stem, but stand severely aloof from the verbal
prefixes. The radical phonetic changes which the verb-stem under-
goes for tense in both languages is perhaps the most striking
resemblance between the two; but even in this regard they differ
widely as to the methods               employed.     Neither   the very extended
use of reduplication in Takelma, nor the frequent use in Atha
pascan of distinct verb-stems for the singular and plural, is shared
by the other. Add to this the fact that the phonetic systems of
Athapascan      and    Takelma     are more        greatly divergent      than      would
naturally be expected of neighboring languages, and it becomes clear
that the opinion that has generally been held, though based on
practically no evidence, in regard to the entirely distinct character-
istics of the two linguistic stocks, is thoroughly justified.
  The entire lack of nominal cases in Takelma and the lack of pro-
nominal incorporation in Klamath indicate at the outset the funds
mental morphologic difference between these stocks. In so far as
nominal cases and lack of pronominal                 incorporation     are made        the
chief morphologic criteria of the central Californian group of linguistic
families, as represented, say, by Maidu and Yokuts, absolutely no
resemblance is discernible between those languages and Takelma. As
far, then, as available linguistic material gives opportunity for judg-
ment, Takelma stands entirely isolated among its neighbors.
   In some respects Takelma is typically American, in so far as it is
possible at all to speak of typical American linguistic characteristics.
Some of the more important of these typical or at any rate wide-
spread American traits, that are found in Takelma, are: the incor-
poration of the pronominal (and nominal) object in the verb; the
incorporation of the possessive pronouns in the noun; the closer
association with the verb-form of the object than the subject; dl
inclusion of a considerable number of instrumental and local m
cations in the verb-complex; the weak development of differences
tense in the verb and of number in the verb and noun; and t
impossibility of drawing a sharp line between mode and tense.
  § 116
poss]     HANDBOOK     OF   INDIAN   LANGUAGES—TAKELMA             283   Of the more special grammatical characteristics, some of which are
nearly unparalleled in those languages of North America that have
been adequately studied, are: a system of pitch-accent of fairly con-
siderable, though probably etymologically secondary, formal sig-
nificance; a strong tendency in the verb, noun, adjective, and adverb
toward the formation of dissyllabic stems with repeated vowel (e. g.,
aorist stem yowo- BE; verb-stem loho- DIE; noun mozo‘ BUZZARD;
adjective hos-d"" [plural] GzTTIna Bia; adverb olo‘m FORMERLY); &
very considerable use of end reduplication, initial reduplication being
entirely absent; the employment of consonant and vowel changes as a
grammatical process; the use in verbs, nouns, and adjectives of pre-
fixed elements, identical with body-part noun stems, that have refer-
ence now to parts of the body, now to purely local relations; the
complicated and often irregular modifications of a verbal base for
the formation of the most generalized tense, the aorist; the great
differentiation of pronominal schemes according to syntactic rela-
tion, class of verb or noun, and tense-mode, despite the comparatively
small number   of persons   (only five—two singular, two plural, and
one indifferent); the entire lack in the noun and pronoun of cases
(the subjective and objective are made unnecessary by the pronominal
and nominal incorporation characteristic of the verb; the possessive,
by the formal use of possessive pronoun affixes; and the local cases,
by the extended use of pre-positives and postpositions) ; the existence
in the noun of characteristic suffixes that appear only with pre-
positives and possessive affixes; the fair amount of distinctness that
the adjective possesses as contrasted with both verb and noun; the
use of a decimal system of numeration, tertiary or quinary in origin;
and arather efficient though simple syntactic apparatus of subordi-
nating elements and well-modulated enclitic particles. Altogether
Takelma has a great deal that is distinct and apparently even isolated
about it. Though typical in its most fundamental features, it may,
when more is known of American languages as a whole, have to
be considered a very specialized type.

direct reflexive suffix, it would seem, is employed only when the
rect object is incorporated in the verb; if the direct object is taken
it of the verb-complex and provided with a possessive pronoun, all
nbiguity as to the relation between subject and object is removed
id the -gwa- falls out. Thus we have da°%-de‘le’p‘gwa HE PIERCED
{8 OWN EAR with indirect reflexive -gwa- to show the possession of
1e object (da*- rar) by the subject; da*dele’p’t would mean HE
‘ERCED ANOTHER’S EAR.         The former sentence can also be expressed
ore analytically by dénadagwa hadele'p‘t H18-OWN (-dagwa) -EAR HE-
i-PIERCED-IT; dénada hadele’p‘t would then have reference to the
iercing of another’s ear. In other words, the reflexive idea is
cpressed in the verb or in the noun according to whether the latter

                 INTRANSITIVE          SUFFIXES   (§§   52-57)                         § 52. General Remarks
 Under this head are included such suffixes as intransitivize a transi-
ive verb by removing the object (-va-), transferring the object from
rithout to within the sphere of the subject (reflexive, reciprocal), or
hanging the character of the action altogether (non-agentive, posi-
ional). The passive intransitivizes by removing, not the object, but
he subject, the former remaining in exactly the same form in which
ve find it in the corresponding transitive; the voice is characterized
y peculiar suffixes that differ for the various tense-modes, and which,
ollowing as they do the pronominal elements of the verb, will receive
ppropriate treatment in discussing the purely formal verbal elements.
‘he normal transitive, its ancillary passive, the active intransitive
-ca-), the reflexive, the reciprocal, the non-agentive, and the posi-
ional may be looked upon as the seven voices of a transitive verb, of
vhich only the first five (possibly also the sixth), however, can be
reely formed from any transitive stem.      Of the seven voices, the
ifst two are provided with a distinct set of pronominal object (and
Tansitive subject) suffixes; the third       and the fifth, with Class I
ntransitive subjects; the remaining,         with Class II intransitive
subjects.

{a]md-, [ajld; a final radical -d-, however, unites with -za- to form
-sd-). Verbs of Type 5 employ not the aorist, but the verb-stem,
in the aorist of the -za- derivative (cf. the parallel phenomenon in
the formation of the frequentative, § 43, 1 and 6; for exceptions see
§ 40, 5), inserting the repeated stem-vowel between the fortis conso-
nant of the stem and the suffix; -za- derivatives of Type 5 verbs
thus belong to Type 2.         For the vocalism of the stem of -za- forms,
see § 31, 5.        Verbs in -xa- of Types 2 and 3 regularly have a short
second stem vowel, even if the quantity in the primitive verb is long;
this short vowel may, however, be secondarily lengthened, with fall-
ing accent, to express a frequentative idea.  In non-aorist forms the
stress tends to fall on the -xa-. Verbs in -za- can be formed, of
course, only from transitives, and, although in form they are strictly
intransitive, they always logically imply an object. Examples of

"                    § 40. TYPES   OF    STEM-FORMATION   In looking over the many examples of verb and corresponding
iorist stems obtained, it was found possible to make out sixteen types
of stem-relations. Of this large number of types about half are of
requent occurrence, while of each of the rest but few examples have
been found. It is not claimed for a moment that all of these types
should be regarded as being exactly on a par, but merely that they
aave the value of forming a convenient systematization of the some-
what bewildering’ mass of methods of radical or base changes encoun-
tered. It is very probable that some of these are ramifications of
others, while some types show more or less petrified suffixes that for
3ome reason or other became specialized in certain tenses. As com-
parative linguistic material is entirely lacking, however, we can not
make a genetic classification of types; a purely descriptive classifi-
cation must suffice.
  In the following table of types of stem-formation, c means conso-
nant; v, vowel; c/, the fortis correspondent of c; c,, c,, and so on, other
consonants; v’ denotes pseudo-diphthong; other letters are to be
literally interpreted.

here listed. There is a considerable number of more or less isolated
cases left, particularly of frequentative or usitative forms, that it is
difficult to classify; but on closer examination some at least of thes
are seen to be secondary developments. Verb-stem al-sgalwal(u)-
KEEP LOOKING BY TURNING HEAD SLIGHTLY TO SIDE, as compared to
aorist stem al-sgala*l(aw)-, looks anomalous because
                                                   of its apparently
inserted first -w-; but these two forms become explicable as frequer
tative developments, according to Type 8, of their corresponding
simplexes, verb-stem al-sgalw- LOOK BY TURNING HEAD TO SIDE and
aorist stem al-sgalaw-. It will be convenient to dispose of suc
anomalous and difficult cases under such headings as allow them to
appear as at least comparatively regular formations.                                         It should not
be supposed that a particular verb-stem always and necessarily
involves a fixed aorist stem in all possible derivations of the ver),
though in probably the larger number of cases such a fixed paralle
ism may be traced. As examples of the occurrence of more than om
aorist stem to match a verb-stem may be mentioned:

        tive Type 2 yewe*-n-, and, according to Type 8, yewew-ald-
        go back for some one |
  There are few if any verbs whose verb and aorist stems absolutely
coincide. If in nothing else the two differ at least in the quantity
f the stem vowel, the aorist stem always tending to show a long
rowel. In some cases the two (dissyllabic) stems seem identical in
»honetic form because of the persistence of an inorganic a in the
econd syllable of the verb-stem and ‘the presence of a repeated
‘radical @ in the second syllable of the aorist stem. Sometimes only
vertain of the forms built on the verb-stem exhibit the inorganic a;
n such cases the secondary character of the a is directly proven by
ihe forms that lack it. A case in point is:
     aorist stem ts‘!ayam- hide; verb-stem ts‘/ay[a]’m- and ts-la-im-
  Other verbs, however, are phonetically so constituted as to require
the presence of the inorganic a in all forms derived from the verb-
stem. Suchare:
       aorist stem agan- feel, hear; verb-stem ag[{a]n-
       aorist stem p/ahan- be ripe, done; verb stem p/ah{a}n-
  Under      such circumstances         ambiguous          forms     may   result;    e. g.,
pafagani‘t’ may be construed either as an aorist (YOU FELT IT) or as
a potential (You WOULD FEEL IT) derived from the stem ag{a]n-.
But evidence is not lacking even in these cases to prove the inor-
vanic character of the second a in the non-aorist forms. One test
has been already referred to in another connection—the incapability
of a secondary diphthong (a diphthong involving an inorganic a) to
have a rising accent. Thus:
     aorist da“agafi (-aga‘n) he heard it; but imperative da“ag[a’]n
        hear it!
   A second test is the failure of inorganic a to become ablauted to e.
Thus:                                         .
     aorist p!ehen- a’nzi he causes me to be done; but future p!eh[ajn-
        a’nxink* he will cause me to be done
  The various types of stem-formation will now be taken up in the
order of their occurrence in the table.

   Type 1. Verb-stem v+c; aorist v°++.   In this type are embraced
partly monosyllabic and partly dissyllabic verb-stems that either
seem to undergo no change at all in the aorist or merely lengthen
the stem-vowel. The number of verbs that follow the type does not
seem to be very great. Examples:

  As regards the accent of the stem syllable, the examples show that,
whenever accented, it takes the rising pitch when long, the raised
pitch when short (and final).         Compare further:

     Type   2. Verb-stem v+c; aorist v+c+v.              If, as seems probable,
the second consonant of verbal bases ending in two consonants is in
many cases really a petrified suffix, a very large proportion of those
verbs that might be listed under Type 3 really belong here, thus
making Type 2 probably the most numerously represented of all types.
In some forms it is possible to detect the derivative character of the
second consonant by a comparison of etymologically related forms
that lack it; e. g., in ts‘/elm- RATTLE         (aorist ts‘/elem-), the -m- is
shown to be a suffix, though of no determinable signification, becausé
of its absence ip the corresponding frequentative ts:/elets:lal-. A
corroborative phonetic test lies in the treatment of the first con-
sonant of the cluster, in so far as verbs following Type 3 show a fortis
in the aorist as against a media or tenuis in the verb-stem, while those

Boas]             HANDBOOK          OF   INDIAN       LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                            99of Type 2 suffer no change in this respect; e. g., verb-stem wism-
Move has aorist according to Type 3, wits*lim-, as contrasted with
verb-stem t‘gism- GET GREEN with aorist of Type 2 t‘gisim- (t‘gism-
should therefore be analyzed as base t‘gis- + suffix -m-). This
criterion enables us to pick out an otherwise unsuspected suffix in
verbs like t/ap‘g- FINISH, aorist t/abag- (not Type 3, *t/ap/ag-), but
can be applied only where the first consonant of the verb-stem is s,
b,d, or g. A more general phonetic test would seem to be the
position occupied by the inorganic vowel -a-. In those cases in
which we have most reason to consider the second consonant as
part of the base, this -a- follows the cluster as ‘‘constant”’ a; while
otherwise, and indeed in the majority of cases, it is inserted between
the two consonants: wisma’t‘e® I SHALL MOVE (base wism-), but
gisa’mt‘e* 1 (AS PLANT) SHALL GET GREEN. An application of these
various criteria, were sufficient material at hand, would probably -
show that but a comparatively small number of verbs follow Type 3.
Examples of verbs of Type 2 are:

Although the absolute number of non-pronominal suffixes in the

at have a well-defined, more or less transparent signification is not
tge (hardly more than a dozen or so) when compared with what

 barely one or two (a frequentative and ‘a comitative) can be said to
 convey anything like a material notion, the rest being of the more «
 less formal or relational character met with in suffixes of inflective lar
 guages—intransitivizing elements, causative, reflexive, passive, recip
 rocal, and others of less easily described signification. Those suflixes|
 that have no clearly defined value may be put in a class by them
 selves as “petrified” suffixes, the justification for such a classifics
 tion being purely descriptive; genetically they probably form g
 heterogeneous group.

  careful analysis to be really of a suffixal character. The criteria {

  evidently related forms in which the consonant is lacking, partly
  certain phonetic features.     . In a considerable number of cases di
  ferent suffixes are found joined to the same verbal base, yet har!
  ever determining so specific a meaning that their primary ‘Jain
  can be detected.    The following examples,
        tgeits: /t something round lies (138.24)
        t‘geyeba’én I roll it
        t'ge°ya'lade® I run around
        al-t'geye’t'giya‘n I tie it around (my head) 188.5
        wit4-t geye’ *klin he is surrounded on all sides 48.13
  evidently all contain the same radical element or base (t‘gey)
  which has reference to circular action or position.        The sufixa
  -ts-!-, -b-, and -k!-, however, can not be shown to be directly respot
  sible for the specific meanings of the different forms, these bei
  determined chiefly, it would seem, by the succeeding suffixes,t
  prefixes, and the general form (transitive or intransitive) of t
  verb.     Similarly, the forms he*-sgaya’prde' 1 LIE DOWN, da-sgavt
  na’'n I LIE DOWN, and possibly also da-sgalt Ir LIES SCATTER
  ABOUT (LIKE GRAIN), contain the same radical element (sga[y    ]-) ; but
  as in the examples first cited, the abstracted suffixes -p-, -n-, a
  -l-, refuse to yield anything tangible. The stems “galb- TWIST all

oxplained.         The same difficulty is met with in di’/ntk! a'n 1 STRETCHED
(fT OUT (62.1) and ba*-dini/‘t!a'n 1 HUNG THEM ON LINE (59.9).   In
some cases a difference of suffix is associated with a difference
of direction of verbal action, transitive and intransitive. Thus we
have:
        al-ts!ayaga’'n I wash him (64.5): al-is!layap‘deé I wash myself
          (not reflexive in form)
        plalaga’*n I relate a myth to him: p/ala’p‘de I relate a myth
        ts!ayama’'n I hide it (124.23): ts!ayap‘de® I hide
The various petrified suffixes found will be listed with examples
under each.
1. -b-.     There seem to be two quite distinct -b- suffixes, one charac-
          teristic of transitives, the other of a certain group of intransi-
          tives.     Examples of transitive -b- are:
        t‘geyeba’én I roll it (base t‘gey-), with secondarily intransitive
           derivative:
        al-t‘geya‘pz it is round (literally, it rolls)
        he**-sgaya’pade® I lie down (derived, like al-t'geya‘pz, from some
          such transitive as *he*-sgayaba’‘n I lay it down flat, that,
           however, does not happen to occur in the material at hand)
        de‘-1-gene’p‘gwa he lay curled up like dog (also -geneak‘wa) *
        galaba’‘n I twist it by rolling (cf. gelg- twirl fire-drill)
        sgipz warm your back! (seems to imply *sgi‘lba’n I shall warm
          his back) (25.8, 9)
   All iniransitives in -b- (-p‘-), whether or not secondarily derived
          from transitives, belong to that class of verbs to be later dis-
          cussed as Intransitive Verbs, Class II.          Among    those with
          primarily intransitive -p‘- are:
        al-ts!aya&p‘de® I washed my face
        ts!ayap‘de® I hid
        plala’p‘deé I tell a myth
        sin-aintzanp‘de® I sniff (cf. 2tn mucus)
        s‘as‘a'nhap‘det I stand     around   (not trying   to help anyone)   (cf
          s‘a’s‘ant‘e® I shall stand)
      sin-wi'litk‘ap‘de® I blow my nose
      ba*-s-o'wo“*k‘ap‘de® I jump up (48.15; 49.1)
    A number of Class II intransitive vervs show a suffixed -p*- in all
        forms but the aorist. It is not possible to say whether this
        ~p'- is morphologically identical with the -p‘- of verbs like
                                                                        § 42
120                   BUREAU    OF   AMERICAN    ETHNOLOGY                 [BULL. 40           ts!ayap‘de® or not, but such seems likely.        Intransitives with
         non-aoristic ~p'- are:
      lap‘de¢ I shall become (92.11) (aorist la*Utt'e®) 186.19
      sana’p‘de¢ I shall fight (aorist sa¢*nsa’nt‘e® [184.13]
      tganp‘de¢ I shall be cold (aorist t‘gunak‘de® [90.3]
  Finally, all Class II intransitives have a -p‘- before the formal
        elements in the first person plural and impersonal of the aorist
        and future and in the imperative and inferential modes:
     sas'inip'ik’ we stand
     sa’s'anp‘ia“t’ they (indef.) will stand
     s‘a’s‘anp‘ stand!
      s‘a’s‘anp‘anp* do ye stand!
      s‘a’s‘anp‘ga°m stand! (future)
      s‘a’s‘anp‘k‘ he stood, it seems’
  There is small doubt, however, that this -p‘- is quite distinct from
       the non-aoristic -p‘- of verbs like lép‘de¢, which occurs in
           the entire future.    A form like lap‘ Become! is in that event
           perhaps to be analyzed as /a*-p'‘-p’', the first -p‘- being the non-
           aoristic element found also in lép‘de*, while the second -p’- is
           identical with the imperative-inferential -p‘- of s-a’s-anp’.
           This analysis is purely theoretical, however, as contraction to
           a single -p‘- is unavoidable in any case.
2. ~p!-.      This consonant    is evidently    a suffixed element in:
      ha‘-hii'liip
                 i'n I skinned them (cf. ha‘-1-hii'lii*hal they skinned
        them all 160.5)
3. -m-. Apparently as transitive element ~m- appears in:
     ts!ayama’'n I hide it (124.23) (cf. ts/ayap‘de® I hide [24.2])
   As intransitive suffix it appears in:
     t‘gisi’/'m it gets green
      zudumt'e® I whistle (base zud-; related to zdett‘ flute[?])          (33.16)
      ts‘!us-ufit‘e® I make noise by drawing in breath between teeth
           and lower lip (78.9,10,12;   79.1,3,5;   96.9,10,12)
  It may not be altogether accidental that the latter two verbs both
       express the making of a noise. This idea is found expressed
           also in:
      ts‘ lelefit’e® I rattle (102.13) (cf. 7-ts-/ele’ts-!ili'n I rattle it)
           but the -m- of this verb may be really an older -n- dissimilated
           to -m- because of the preceding -l-.       The -m- corresponds to
           an evidently identical suffixed -am- of the related noun ts-/ela‘m

     wahimida’'n          I speak       to him        (but with unexpressed                  object
         wa*himi'rade® I was talking [to somebody]) (59.16; 63.10)
     dak'‘-hene*da’'n I wait for him (cf. hene’zade® I wait)
     kliyimida’n I call his name from distance, greet him (198.11)
        (probably derivative of k/i’yam friend! 31.6, 8)
     s-omoda’‘n I cook it (58.10) (cf. s-iimii’zade® I cook)
     ts-ltimimt‘a'n I cook it (170.17,19); future s-dmt‘an ' (170.16)
        (cf. s-iimai‘ stirring paddle 170.14)
     da*-minik'da‘n I taught him; future da*-mifit‘an
     lawadana’‘n I hurt him (186.12)
     yamada’én I ask him (70.6; 74.10; 120.16)
     wiyimada’tn I “wish” to him, work supernatural power on him
         57.1
     mnieda *n I love her
   za‘-1-ts‘/iwi‘t‘ he split it (26.6) (cf. 7-ts-/iwi’‘ts:!aw he split it up)
It will be noticed that most of the verbs listed imply, not direct
      physical action, but rather the direction of one’s thought or
      words toward another person. It is therefore highly probable
         that the -d- (except possibly in s-omd- coox) is identical with
         the -d- implied in the -s’- (= -tz-) of the indirect object (§ 47).
         Unlike the -d- here discussed, however, the -s-- of the indirect
         object can be used only if the indirect object is not of the
         third person.        It is clear that -d- is not really quite in line
         with    the other suffixes that we have termed “ petrified,”
     this being shown, among other things, by the fact that it
     may be preceded by other suffixes, as in da*-mint-k‘-da‘n.
Evidently quite distinct from this indirective -d- suffix is the
         -(a)d- suffix of a few intransitive class II verbs in which the
         -d- is followed by -t‘- in aorist, -i- in non-aorist forms (see § 40,
         16). This aoristic -ad- appears always umlauted to -id-.
     cugwidi‘-, non-aorist cuk‘di- lie curled up
     wiklidi-, non-aorist witk'dt- lie heaped about
     t'‘guplidt (box, canoe) lies bottom side up
 -t/-.      This consonant has been found as an evident suffix in:
     ba*-di'nit !ana'n I strung (dentalia) on line (59.9) (cf. dink!-
        stretch out)
     t'gemat ra“ it gets dark 188.14 (cf. t‘ge*mt‘ga‘mz it is quite dark
         (cf. 196.7]; alt‘ge‘m black 162.4; [196.6])
 som-d- and s-tim-t'a- are parallel forms of one verb that seem to be used with no difference in mean-
s, though their aorist stems are formed according to different types.
                                                                                            § 42

          two distinct -g- suffixes, the one appearing as a transitivizing
          element, the other as a verb-making element added on to
          nouns or adjectives. Examples of its transitive use are:
  ' plalaga’‘n I tell him a myth
    al-ts!ayaga’‘n I wash him (64.5)
    p!it-wa-gelegi’'n I drill for fire with it (88.12)

    da-t!abaga’'n I finish it (61.8; 176.6)
    da*-dalaga’mda‘n I put holes in his ear (22.1) (cf. da?-dele’p'ihe
       stuck it across his ear)
    swadat' ga‘n I run after him (59.13; 75.3; 120.19, 20)
  Examples of its use in adjectival intransitives are:
       tdwit’*k‘ he feels hot, it is hot 94.15 (cf. t‘@ hot 57.15)
       diwi’*k' it is good, he does right 180.11 (cf. da good, beautifil

         and s‘tz-xu‘m dried venison 43.12,13)
       gel-dulu’k‘de® I am lazy
  Further examples of -k‘- that are difficult to classify are:
      “ de-liimii'sgade® I tell the truth (184.3)
    sin-wilitk‘ap‘dam you blow your nose
    yala’k‘de® I dive (connected with yal- lose [?]) (60.10,11; 61.11)

       in the morphologically analogous da*-mintk‘da‘n 1 TAUGHT HM
       (future dé*mifit‘an), the -k‘- is confined to the aorist. In wis
       HE TOOK IT FROM HIM 16,13, the -g- is found only in the thin
          personal object of the various         tense-modes    (wét‘gin ir Ws
        TAKEN FROM HIM 13.11; wede’k‘ink’ HE WILL TAKE IT FRO
        HIM (17.10,11). All other forms of the aorist stem we‘d- (verb
        stem wede-) lack it:
     wési (from *wét'si) he took it from me (17.3)
     wede’sbink* he will take it from you (16.10,11) .
7. -kl-, -ke!w-. These elements seem to be characteristic of trat
        sitives. Examples are:

        passives are closely related) 48.5,13; (176.14)

  -k!- seems to occur also in the perhaps only secondarily intransitive:
     ba*-sowd'“k‘ap‘det (=-s'owd'""k!-hap'-) I jump up (48.15; 49.1)
        (cf. s'o’wo%s'a“ he keeps jumping [112.5,10])
3. -tsef-. Only ina very few cases is this suffixed consonant met with:
     t‘geits:t round thing lies (138.24)
     dt'-t'gumu’tclién I squeeze and crack it (cf. di-t‘gumu’t'gimien I

       ha‘w-i-ha’nats én I made it stop (raining)         (152.16)
  Judging from these few examples, -is‘/- is characteristic, like -d-,
         -g-,-p!-, -k!-, and -t!-, of transitive verbs; t‘geits:!t is probably
         related   to   a transitive    *t‘ge’yets‘!a'n, as is dink/t ir LIES

   -8- occurs as an evident suffix in:
      di‘-tltisi/'n I mashed them (cf. dit-tliyi’tliya'n I mashed them
         one after another).
9. -(a)l-.       This suffix includes both intransitives and transitives:

           these examples to be connected with the suffix -(a)/-.
10. -(a)n-. Quite a number of intransitives are found that have
       this element, to which no particular meaning can be assigned.
       Such are:
    s‘as‘intt'e€ I stand (34.1; 77.9; 144.14,17)
    moytigwa’nt'e® I’m spoiled
    hit*li’nt'e® I am tired (102.1) (cf. Aiilii’hilint‘e® I used to be tired
             48.11
      lighns'e Pam resting (100.14) (cf. ligilaga‘nt‘ he kept resting 102.1)
    In a large number of transitives a suffixed -n- is also found, with-
        out its being clearly possible to identify it either with the causs-
           tive -n- or the indirect objective -n(an)- For:
       lawadana’‘n I hurt him (186.12)
       ts‘!ibina’*n I make a speech to him (146.11;                               178.11)
       wa-tliltk‘ni'n I gave each one (130.4)
       klemna’'n I shall make it (28.2,13,14) (aorist without                                           object

       watiqwini’'n I drink it with it (a“gwa’nade® I drink)
       he*-wa‘-wa%gini’n she is bought with it
   The last two examples are rather different in character from the
       others. See § 64.
11. -w-. Two apparently quite distinct -w-suffixes must be taken
        account of.
   (1) A suffixed -w- is found to characterize in all forms a group of
           intransitives belonging to Type 2; it is only in certain deriv-
           ative forms that the -w- is lacking, and thereby possibly shown
         to be a non-radical element:
       hiwilitt'e. I ran to (24.1), but hiwiltt‘e® I used to run to
     sgeletit'e€ I shouted (196.1), but sgelélt‘e®: I kept shouting (59.3)
   Examples of this group of verbs are:

  1§till, in these frequentative (usitative) forms the absence of the -w- may be accounted for by supposiig
that it dropped off as a syllabic final after a consonant (see §18). Then sgeléit‘e® is for an older*sgeléluf¢.
This supposition is greatly strengthened by the future sgelwa’lt'e¢ I'LL KEEP SHOUTING (cf. sgelwada’t YoU
‘WILL SHOUT).
    § 42
Boas]             HANDBOOK    OF INDIAN       LANGUAGES—TAKELMA               125   In non-aoristic forms          the   phonetic   conditions   may,   as   usual,
          necessitate an inorganic -a-:
        ge wila’u run there! (29.10)
        sgela’ut‘e* I shall shout
        bila’ut‘e* I shall jump    (160.17)
   In these cases the evidence for the suffixal character of the -w- is
       rather slim. In one verb, however, it has a clearly intransi-
       tivizing influence:
     tlemeyana’“ (second a inor- : tlamayana’‘n I take her to her
       ganic) he goes with woman           husband (148.5)
       to see her married 148.6
     tlemeya/nwia™ they (indef.) go
          with her to see her married
          178.1
   (2) -w- (-aw- after a consonant in the aorist) is characteristic of all
       tense-modes but, in some cases, the present imperative and
       inferential (probably for phonetic reasons, see §§ 11 and 18) of
          a number of transitive verbs, provided          the object is of the
         third person.       Such verbs are:
        gayawa’'n I eat it 30.11 (gayati he ate it 54.5); future ga-iwa’n
          128.18; noun of agent ga-iwa’‘s eater (of it) 94.3; but impera-
           tive gat eat it! 32.4; gatk* he ate it (inferential) 142.19
        al-sgalawi''n I turn my head to look at him; future sga%lwi’n;
          part. sgala’uk‘ (-a’/- is inorganic) 144.17; but sga@lk‘a‘ I looked
          at him turning my head (inferential)
        al-sgala*liwi''n (Type 8) I keep turning my head to look at him;
          future sgalwalwi’n; but sgelélai he keeps turning his head to
       look at me
    ‘ba-t-de-ye'giwida’* you will drive (sickness) out of (body) 198.4,5;
       imperative -ye‘ga’u
        wagiwi’'n I brought it to him (176.17); future wagawi’n; but
          waga’sbitn I brought it to you (194.11)
        la*la’uhi he caused them to become (/4¢1- become) 43.1
  It is very likely that the absence of the -w- is conditioned, at least
         in certain forms, rather by phonetic than by morphologic mo-
         tives (gat from * gatw; sgalk‘a‘ from *sga@lwk‘a‘). This is ren-
         dered plausible by a form like ga-iwawa'lsbink’ THEY WILL
         ALWAYS EAT YOU 26.8 (repetition of -w- in frequentative as in
         al-sgalwalwi’n), in which the object is not of the third person.
         The -w- seems to have been retained here because of the follow-
         ing vowel. The form wé&%ga’*n 1 BROUGHT IT (110.17) as com-
                                                                            § 42
126                 BUREAU          OF    AMERICAN   ETHNOLOGY                  [BULL. 40        pared with wa¢giwi’'n I BROUGHT               IT TO HIM    (future waga’n:
        wagawi'n) suggests that the signification of the -w- in transi-
        tive verbs is to indicate the indirect object, at least for the
        third person.  It is, however, almost certainly accidental that
        wagiwi’'n stands by the side of wa*ga’sbi'n with -s- to indicate
        the indirect object. That -w- is not the morphologic equivalent
        of -s- is evidenced by the fact that it stands also by the side
        of the transitive connective consonant -z- (cf. al-sgalawi''n:
        al-sgala’xbi‘n 1 TURN MY HEAD TO LOOK AT You).                      It must be
        confessed that after all no very distinct signification can be
        attached to either the intransitive or transitive -w-.
  12.   Constant         -a.   A     number     of verbs whose stem          (including
        petrified   suffix) ends in two consonants add to this                     stem
        an -a that appears in all their forms, even though                     the con-
        sonant combination is one that may stand in a final position
        (cf. footnote,     § 10).        No reason can be assigned for the reten-
        tion of the -a in all forms, except the ruling analogy of the,
        aorist; in this tense-mode the -a is in all probability directly
        due to the consonant-cluster, as the aorist verb-forms to be|
        presently given differ in this very respect from the aorist forms
        of other stems ending in two consonants (e. g., non-aorist,
        s‘ti*mt‘a- BorL with constant -a-, though ending in a finally
        permissible consonant-cluster, because of aorist ts*/iimii*mt'c-;
        contrast non-aorist s‘omd- BOIL without -a- because of aorist
        s‘omod-). The following are examples of verbs of the char-|
        acter described:
                     Aorist                                    Non-aorist
      swadat'ga he followed him 75.3 — swa’t‘ga, follow him!
      mats !asga he always put it 132.9 masga‘ put it! 104.5
      is‘liimimt'a he boils it 30.2 .   s-Omt‘a boil it!
      da*-mintk'da he taught him        da*-mifit'a teach him!                     (con-

                                                      with aorist -himid-)
  If the verb is instrumental in vocalism (see § 64), the constant a
       is replaced by the instrumental 7. Thus:
     7-k!os‘ds‘gi he keeps pinching him
  That this constant -a is felt to be somewhat different in character
         from ordmary inorganic or connective -a- (as in ts:/ela’mt'e* or
        -wa%ga'sbi'n) is shown by the fact that it is changed to -2- when-

               § 43. FREQUENTATIVES             AND    USITATIVES Frequentatives, continuatives, and usitatives are formed from sim-
er verb forms in great part by various methods of repetition of all
‘ part of the phonetic material of the stem, to a somewhat less
ctent by means of suffixation.            In many repetitive forms a distinct
ndency to use a long vowel provided with a rising pitch-accent is
»servable. As it has not been found feasible to draw anything like
.arp lines between the exact significations of the various repetitive
rms, it seems best to dispose of the material from a purely formal
dint of view rather than to attempt to classify it rigidly into fre-
uentatives, iteratives, usitatives, and continuatives.                The methods
{ forming repetitives will be taken up in order.
 1. Type 13 of Stem-Formation.                      It was remarked before that
iost verbs of this type normally employed in that form are such
3 to imply a repetition of the action they express. The type
1ay, moreover, be freely formed from bases implying non-repetitive
ction whenever it is desired to convey a general frequentative or
sitative     meaning.      The      frequentative     idea   may    have     reference
o the repetition of the act itself (iterative or usitative) or to the
lurality of the        transitive    object    or intransitive     subject    affected
distributive); any sharp            characterization     of the manner         of the
requentative     action in each        case is, however,      doubtless      artificial
part from the context. The following examples of repetitive with
orresponding non-repetitive forms will illustrate the general fre-
juentative force: -

   It will be observed that the repetitive form is, on the whol
built up on the verbal base, not the verb or aorist stem. Thu
e. g., the verb-stems lebe- and loho- do not enter into the formatia
of the frequentatives at all, which are formed, according to Typ
13a, directly from the simple bases leb- (verb-stem le*p‘lab-, aorm
lebelab-) and loh- (verb-stem lohlah-, aorist loholah-). Similarly,
form like plaga’p/atk' shows no trace of the aorist stem p/aga
of the simplex; verbs of Type 6 generally show the fortis consonaa
of the base in all forms of the frequentative (see §40, 6): sgot!o’sgidi}
I CUT     IT TO PIECES (144.2) (cf. sg6’“da‘n 1 cuT IT 72.10, base sgatl
  § 43
as]            HANDBOOK       OF INDIAN   LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                 1295.10). Suffixes with no distinct derivative signification drop off in
e frequentative (cf. ts:!iu-d- and hiil-p!- above, also §42 passim),
it, if they are functional elements, are put after the reduplicated
mplex (cf. loho-n- and hen-d- above); frequentatives thus become,
‘ was indicated in the treatment of petrified suffixes, criteria for
.e determination of the simple base. Some verbs, however, retain
 petrified suffix in the frequentative without apparent reason:                   —
‘hiimtmt'‘a HE BOILS IT; ts‘/iimii'ts'!amt‘a HE ALWAYS BOILS IT.
The      only use made of the aorist stem in the formation of fre-
ientatives is in the case of such forms as have an initial fortis
. the aorist as against a media in the verb-stem, mainly verbs of
ype 8.        The aorist of the corresponding frequentative also shows
ie initial fortis, but is not otherwise influenced by the form of the
orist stem of its simplex; e. g., aorist of simplex, t/ozoz-, but of
equentative, ¢/oz-o-t/az- with retained ¢/-. Such            verbs as aorist
oxot/ax, non-aorist dé""xdax-, are to be considered as of mixed type
n this case partly 8, partly 13a).
 Verbs like odo‘ad- and ogo‘ag- with a secondarily developed glottal
atch in the aorist (see §6) seem to retain this catch in non-aorist
rms, a stop+the catch resulting in a fortis:
      aorist ogo’‘ag- always give to; non-aorist o’k![w]ag-
  A small sub-class is formed by those frequentatives that omit the
1- of the repeated base (Type 13c). Such are:
                  Verb-stem                           Repetitive

                                               footnote) (45.6)
\ very peculiar type of frequentative formation is illustrated by:
    loha’lhik‘ (a’ is inorganic) they used to die (inferential) (168.9) ;
       aorist stem doubtless loholhi-                     :
lerived from aorist lohoi- die, non-aorist loho- (contrast aorist loho-
ah-an-, non-aorist lohlah-an in the causative).      The otherwise purely
vristic -i- of Type 4 is here dragged into the non-aorist forms.

   2. Type 4 of Reduplication.                This method of forming the fre-
quentative seems to be but a variant of the first (the repeated initial
consonart coming last instead of immediately              after the connecting
vowel, or the initial consonant not being repeated at all if there isa
petrified suffix), and is found in only a few verbs, where it takes
 the place of the first method. A glottal catch generally separates
‘the repeated vowel of the stem from the immediately following a.
Examples are:                                                                             |

   If the    initial      consonant   is a fortis, it becomes a media when
repeated, as illustrated in the first three examples.                     This may be
explained by catch dissimilation (see §22)—e, g., a theoretical
*kliwi'fautk’ (from *kliwi’klau) is dissimilated to k!awi’‘auk'.
Similarly a theoretical * p/awi’‘au'k' (from * pliwii’ plaufk') is dis
similated     to pliwi’‘auk‘.         -The non-aorist frequentative           forms of
these verbs sometimes follow the first method of formation (cf.
d6“mda‘mk* under method 1), sometimes the second (as k/em‘amg-).
   3. c+v+¢,+v+ec.     The few verbs that belong here differ from
the preceding in that they repeat only the initial consonant after
the repeated stem-vowel (Type 11).              An example is:
   § 43
\8]           HANDBOOK OF INDIAN         LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                   131

                                               it, used to wear it
As in the first method, so also in the second and third, non-
dical functionless elements of the simplex disappear in the fre-
ientative. Thus the suffixed -1- of k/emét HE MADE IT and -n- of
eme’nza£ HE MAKES, also the aorist characteristic of di-t/igit HE
ORE IT, are not found in their corresponding frequentative forms.
4.   v+e+u""+e.      The large number of verbs whose frequentatives
llow this formula (1a of types of reduplication) always have another
nsonant, whether part of the stem or a petrified suffix, after the non-
rtis repeated consonant characterizing the frequentative, so that
e appearance at least of infixation is often produced. Externally,
equentatives of this type resemble aorists of verbs of Type 8, but
ffer from them in the consistent length of the repeated vowel. In
gnification these verbs are generally continuative or usitative rather
\an properly frequentative or iterative. Asexamples may be given:

to method 4, but with added -g-:

          to come back; yewéo’k‘de®, yewéak‘de®! I used to come back
   There is not enough material available to determine in every cas
the non-aoristic forms of the frequentatives of this group. As a gen-
eral rule, however, it seems that the non-aoristic stem of the frequen-
tative is formed by repeating a consonant or semi-vowel, but in such
& manner as to indicate the non-aoristic simplex back of it. Thus the
frequentative of the inferential ts-/atmk‘ HE HID IT is ts*!a-imik' HE
WAS ALWAYS HIDING IT; of bil[a]juk’ HE JUMPED 160.17 it is bilwalk'
(?= *bilwalwk') THEY ALWAYS JUMPED 160.16. From gatk‘ (inferential)
HE ATE IT 142.19 is formed gayatk* (if really inferential in form; per-
haps third person subject aorist gayazg- in contrast to -gaydiw of other
persons, see above) HE USED TO EAT IT 54.6, which, though resembling
the aorist in the repetition of the stem-vowel, differs from it, probably
for phonetic reasons, in the absence of the -w-. The form wits-!és
made"" HE WILL KEEP MOVING, given as the future of wits-!ismad¢,
can not, for want of parallel forms, be accounted for.                               From sgal-.
non-aorist of sgalaw-, is formed the frequentative sgalw-alw- (perhaps
according to Type 8, o- being a consonatic unit).
   5. Vorrel lengthening. Many verbs, particularly such as be
long to Type 2, obtain a usitative signification by merely lengthening
the short repeated vowel of the stem, this vowel, when stressed, as
suming the falling accent. - Examples of this simple process are:
  \1t is mot as all certain that the -o (-a-) of these forms really represents
                                                                             the -e- of the stem. Itk

 As the last example shows, by this method verbs which are already
cequentative in form can be made to take on a usitative meaning.

   The last two examples do not show a rising pitch-accent, because
the vowel (-a-) preceding the -l- and -n- respectively is inorganic
and therefore incapable of carrying a rising or raised accent (cf. as
parallel bila’ut‘e® 1 SHALL JUMP, not *bilaat‘e*, because of inorganic
-a-).     They     also illustrate the loss in the frequentative of a non-
radical element (-i‘-) of the simplex; in s-é’‘alha‘ the loss of the -7-
involves also the transfer of the verb to the first class of intransitives

  The non-aoristic forms of these frequentatives dispense with the re-
peated vowel (5) characteristic of the aorist, so that the introduction
of an inorganic -a’- is necessitated:
     gwida'Than I shall keep throwing it
     al-xik!a/thik‘ I used to see him (inferential)
  The remarks made under method 1 in regard to the formation of
frequentatives directly from the verb-stem rather than the aorist
stem apply also here (sgot/dlha                   108.8 from verb-stem sgdé/- ctT,
aorist sg6""d-, like sgot!o’sgat').
   8. v+w+vu+tlha.       Only two verbs have been found that follow
this very irregular formula for the frequentative:
                            Simplex                                  Repetitive

       home (70.3,5; 164.4)             home with (game) (136.2)
  The latter of these shows at the same time an unaccountable loss of
the -g- of the stem; the future of the simplex, li‘gwa’n, probably does
not exhibit an absolute loss of the -g-, but rather a contraction of
litg-gw- to litgw-.

iat either transitivize intransitives (causative, comitative, indirective
tmd-, -ald-)      or are characteristic of transitive verbs (indirective
'- = -tz-TO, indirective -an(an)- FoR, indirect reflexive).                     It must be
onfessed, however, that the various suffixes may be so thoroughly
iterwoven among themselves and with the purely formal] elements
iat follow, that a certain amount                    of arbitrariness can hardly be
voided in treating of them.                The suffixes will now be taken up in
rder.
      ;                             § 45. Causative -—(a)n- Causatives are formed from intransitives by the addition of -n-
> the intransitive form, minus, of course, its formal pronominal ele-
1ents. If the final sound preceding the -n- is a vowel, the suffix can
e directly appended, the vowel being generally lengthened; a final
onsonant       (or semivowel), however,              generally,   though       not always,
equires a connective -a- (-t when umlauted) between it and the suffix;
oublets (with and without connective -a-) sometimes occur, the com-
ination of consonant + -n- then taking a constant -a (-7) after it.
f the accented vowel (6) of the aorist immediately precedes the -n-
a all forms, an inorganic -h- must be introduced, the combination
nh- then necessitating a following constant -a; doublets, conditioned
y the position of the accent, here also occur. Certain suffixed ele-
aents (-7-, -2*-) characteristic of intransitives drop off before the caus-
tive -n-, yet in some forms they are retained; intransitivizing ele-
nents naturally remain, for without them the verb would itself be
ransitive and incapable of becoming a causative. The aorist and non-
wrist forms of the causative, with the qualification just made, are
vuilt up on the corresponding tense-mode forms of the primitive verb.
cxamples of causative -(a)n- are:

o explanation can be given of this irregularity.
 The inferential endings, as has been already remarked, are iden-
cal for all classes of verbs, so that the following applies to Class IT
itransitives and to transitives as well as to Class I intransitives.
he mode-sign -k‘ is added directly to the final vowel or consonant
' the verb-stem (or stem with its added derivative and pronominal
bject suffixes) without connecting a.                         All combinations of conso-
ants are here allowed that are at all possible as syllabically final
msters (see § 16); indeed some of the final consonant clusters, as
ik’, -p'le*, -np‘k‘, -lp‘k‘, hardly occur, if at all, outside the inferential.
f the resulting consonant combination would be phonetically impos-
ible an inorganic a is introduced between the two consonants that
recede the inferential -k‘; “secondary diphthongs with raised accent
iay thus arise:
      klema‘nk‘ he made it (verb-stem k/emn-)
      bila‘uk* he jumped 160.17 (verb-stem bilw-)
Jouble diphthongs are often allowed to stand unaltered before -k‘
¢.g.,0Ink'HE GAVE THEM; also imperative otn GIVE THEM!) ; sometimes
loublets, with double diphthong or with inorganic a, are found (e. gZ.,
slatmk* or tslaya‘mk* HE HID IT; also passive participle ts/atmhak'’
mDDEN, but ts/aya’m HIDE IT! ts/eya’mzi HIDE ME! ts/aya’mzamk' HE
mp vs [158.7]). With a final -g- or -gw- the inferential -k' unites
© form -k‘ or -k'”, but with lengthening of the preceding vowel;
k!-+-k* becomes -’k'.                 Examples are:
      heenak'” (=-a‘gw-k') he consumed them (cf. 48.10); but he‘na‘k'v
         consume them!
      wa-yanék'” (=yana'-gw-k') he ran after them 98.10; but wa-
        yana‘k'” run after them!
  ! This form can not possibly have been misheard for *lop/o’*t', the form to be expected, as the subor-
iinate is lop/ot'a*, not *lop/6/udat, whieh would be required by @ *lop/o’#t' (see §70).

 typical of Class I, are derived from transitives, the majority of
 examples falling under the heads of non-agentives in -z-, reflexive.
 in -gwi-, positionals in ~i‘-, and verbs with intransitivizing -p’- either
 in all their tense-modes or in all but the aorist (see § 42,1).                                      Besides
 these main groups there are a straggling number of not easily clas
 sified verbs that also show the peculiarities of the class; such are:
            sene’sant‘e® I whoop (110.20; 180.15)
            wit'e® I go about (90.1; 92.29; 122.23)

 In a rough way the main characteristic of Class II intransitives, s
 far as signification is concerned, is that they denote conditions and
 processes, while Class I] intransitives are in great part verbs of action

 . Those verbs of this class that are characterized, either throughot
their forms or in all non-aorist forms, by a suffixed p‘ have this ee
ment coalesce with the -p‘ of the first person plural, inferential, and
imperative, but with lengthening of an immediately preceding vowel
In the imperative this lengthened                                   vowel seems to take on a falling
accent:                                                                                                                  |          plala’*p' tell a myth!                 (cf. plala’p‘dee I shall tell a myth, wit

the manner of Class II verbs (wok' HE ARRIVES 47.15; wok‘dam rol
ARRIVE), while the non-aorist forms belong to Class I (e. g., woga't
HE WILL ARRIVE). It is further noteworthy that many, perhep
most, Class II intransitives form their usitative and frequentativ
forms according to Class I.                            Examples,          showing the third persd

with the objective elements to form rather closely welded compound
endings, yet hardly ever so that the two can not separately be recog-
nized as such; the order of composition is in every case pronominal
object + subject. It is only in the combinations THov or YE
ve that such composition does not take place; in these the first person
singular object is, properly speaking, not expressed at all, except in
so far as the stem undergoes palatalization if possible (see § 31, 1),
while the second person subject assumes the form in which it is
found in Class II of intransitive verbs. The pronominal objects are
decidedly a more integral part of the verb-form than the subjects,
for not only do they precede these, but in passives, periphrastic
futures, nouns of agency, and infinitives they are found unaccompa-
nied by them. For example:
        dimaxbina® you will be killed (178.15)
     dimabigulu‘k’” he will kill you
     démzbi‘s one who kills you
     déimaxbiya to kill you
are analogous, as far as the incorporated pronominal object (-b7-) is
concerned, to:
    dimaxbink* he will kill you; tlomdxbitn I kill you
The pronominal objects are found in all the tense-modes, as far as
the meaning of these permits, and are entirely distinct from all the
subjective elements, except        that the ending       of the second      person
plural coincides with one form of the second person singular present
 imperative of the intransitive, -anp‘.          These elements are:
   Singular: First person, -xi (with third subjective); second person,
 -hi; third person,   —; third person (human), -k‘wa.                Plural: First
 person, -am; second person, -anp‘ (-anb-).
                                                                            § 62
    168                         BUREAU        OF AMERICAN             ETHNOLOGY                         [BULL.40       It does not seem that -k‘wa-, which is optionally used as the third
    personal object when reference is distinctly had to a human being (or
    to a mythical animal conceived of as a human being), can be com-
    bined with other than a third personal subject (at least no other
    examples have been found); nor can it be used as an indirect ob-
    ject if the verb already contains among its prefixes an incorporated
    indirect object.             These restrictions on the use of -k‘wa- enable us
    effectually to distinguish it from the indirect reflexive -k‘wa- which
    has already been discussed, this element normally requiring an incor-
    porated object             prefixed to the verb.                   Examples         of the objective
    -k‘wa- are:
          tlomok‘wa' it killed him 15.16; 28.11
          he*ak‘wa he went away from him
          hazank‘wa he burnt him 27.16
          sd°nsa’nk‘wa he fought with him 28.10
          nagatk’wa he said to him 152.3 (with very puzzling intransitive
             -t-; contrast naga‘ he said to him)
          wet gigwa she took (it) away from him (49.6)
          lak‘wak* (inferential) he gave him to eat
        In several respects this -k‘wa differs fundamentally from the other
    object suffixes. It allows no connective -x- to stand before it (see§
    64); the indirective -d- of -a/Id- (see § 48) drops out before it:
          gayawa'Tk‘wa he ate him; cf. gayawa’lshi he ate you (26.8)
    and, differing in this respect from the suffixless third person object, it
    allows no instrumental 7 to stand before it (see § 64):
          7-tlana’hagwa he held him (25.10); cf. 7-t!/ana’hi he held it 27.4
          dak‘-da-halk‘wa he answered him 180.18; cf. dak‘-da-ha*li’n |
            answered him (146.14)                                   ;
    It is thus evident that forms with suffixed -k‘wa approximate in
    transitives in form (cf. nagatk'wa above). Withastem-final g, gw the
    suffix unites to form -k‘wa, the preceding vowel being lengthened and
    receiving a rising accent; with a stem-final Xk! it unitesto form -*k'wa,
    the preceding vowel being lengthened with falling accent.                                      Examples
    are:
          tlayak'wa he found him 71.14; cf. tlaya‘k* he found it 43.4; 134.17
          malak‘wa he told him 22.8; (72.14); cf. malagana’nhi he told it
            to him (see § 50) 30.15
               1 The final consonant of the aoristic stem of Type 8 verbs is regularly lost before -k'wa.

Verbs that have a suffixed comitative -(a)gwa- show, in combina-
ion with the objective -k‘wa-, a probably dissimilated suffix -gik‘wa
-gigwa), the connecting a preceding this compound suffix being of
ourse umlauted to 7:
       sebeyigi’k'wa he hurt him (cf. zebeyagwa’én I hurt him [136.23])
       dyi’“sgigwa he laughed at him 27.5 (cf. iyi’*sgwa‘n I laugh at
       him [71.7])
  Itis rather interesting to observe how the objecti- e -k‘wa- may serve
remove some of the ambiguities that are ap’ to arise in Takelma
athe use of the third person. HE GAVE IT TO HIM is expressed in the
nferential by the forms o’k‘ik‘ and o’k‘igwak‘, the latter of which
vecessarily refers to a human indirect object. If a noun or inde-
xndent pronoun be put before these apparently synonymous forms,
entences are framed of quite divergent signification.             In the first
entence (noun +0’k‘ik‘) the prefixed noun would naturally be taken
is the object (direct or indirect) of the verb (e. g., ne’k‘di o’k‘ik,
iE WHO-GAVE IT? [=TO WHOM DID HE GIVE IT?]); in the second
noun +0’k‘tgwak‘), as subject, a doubly expressed object being inad-
nissible (e. g., ne’k‘di o’k‘igwak* WHO GAVE IT TO HIM’).  TO WHOM
1D HE BRING        IT? with incorporated      object ne’k‘di reads ne’k‘dt
ne-wak‘ literally, HE-WHO-HITHER-BROUGHT-IT?              WHO    BROUGHT      IT
‘0 Hm?      with   subject    ne’k‘di reads (as inferential form)      ne’k‘di
vagawo'’k‘wak‘{-o- unexplained).         HE FOUND   THE   ANTs   is expressed
vy thhist! tlaya‘k’, but THE ANTS FOUND HIM by tlibis't' tlayak‘wa
fhe usage illustrated may be stated thus: whenever the third personal
bject refers to a human          being and   the subject is expressed as a
ioun, suffixed -k‘wa must be used to indicate the object; if it is not
ised, the expressed     noun will most naturally be construed          as the
bject of the verb.      An effective means is thus present in Takelma
or the distinction of a personal subject and object.

singular object terminations, it will be observed that the subjective
forms of the transitive are identical with those of the intransitive
(Class I) except in the first person singular and plural aorist and
future, and in the third person aorist and future. The loss in the
future of the catch of the first person singular aorist (-t‘e®: t'¢=
-‘n: ~n) and the addition in the future of -am to the first person
plural aorist (-tk‘: -igam=-nak': -nagam) are quite parallel phe
nomena. It will be observed also that the first person plural,
probably also singular, aorist of the transitive, is in form identical,
except for the mode-sign -k‘-, with the corresponding form of the
inferential, so that one is justified in suspecting this tense-mode to
consist, morphologically speaking, of transitive forms with thin
personal object (see § 60, first footnote).
    The forms of d6*m- (aorist t!omom-) KILL will show the method of
combining subjective and objective pronominal elements.

   How explain the genesis of these two sets of contract verb forms,
and how explain the existence of doublets like mo’lo*ma'n and mo’-
lot‘mala‘n, mo’lo‘mat' and mo’lo‘malat',   oyé*n and oyona’*n, sdnsa‘n
and séns? The most plausible explanation that can be offered is
that originally the personal endings were added directly to the stem
and that later a connecting -a- developed whenever the preceding
consonant or the personal ending was not of a character to form a
diphthong. Hence the original Paradigms may have been:
     First person  . . .      Loe         oyon      mo’lo'ma'n
     Second person    . . ...      . . | oyona‘t’ | mo’lo*mala‘t'
     Third person   . .       1...      | oYin      mo’lo&mal
which were then leveled out to:
                                                                            oyona’én | mo’lo*mala‘n
                                                                            oyona’t’     | mo’lo*malat'
                                                                            oyon           mo'lo'mal
because of the analogy of a vast number of verbs with connecting
-a- in both first and second persons, e. g., ts/ayaga’'n, ts!ayaga‘t'.
Forms like mo‘lo‘mat', sé*nsa‘t', would arise from leveling to the first
  1 This verb is transitive only in form, intransitive in meaning. The true transitive (THINK OF) employs
the full stem hewehaw- with connective -i- for third personal object, and -s- for other objects: gel-hewe’hiwitn
I THINK OF HIM; gel-hewe’hausdam YOU THINK OF ME.
  2The form sgimi’sgatn is interesting as a test case of these contract verb forms. The stem must be
sgimisgam-; it can not be sgimisg-, as sg- could hardly be treated as a repeated initialconsonant.      No cases
are known of initial consonant clusters treated as phonetic units.                                   5   65

 third person generally brings out the original diphthong, yet some
 times the analogy set by the first person seems to be carried over t
 the third person (e. g., sins beside sd*nsa‘n), as well as to the thir
 person passive and first person plural subject transitive. Such form
 as oyd'n are best considered as survivals of an older “‘ athematic”’ typ
 of forms, later put on the wane by the spread of the “‘ thematic’
 type with connecting -a- (e. g., gayawa’'n, not *gaya'n from *gayat'n)

 be looked upon as amplifications of transitive forms with third pe
 sonal subject.                  Every such transitive form may be converted into
 passive by the omission of the transitive subject and the addition c
 elements characteristic of that voice; the pronominal object of th
 transitive becomes the logical, not formal, subject of the passiv
 (passives, properly speaking, have no subject). The passive suffixe
 referred to are -(a)n for the aorist, -(a)na‘ for the future, and -am fo
 the inferential. Imperatives were not obtained, nor is it certain tha

+ is hardly possible that a genetic relation exists between the
wo forms, though a mechanical association is not psychologically
ncredible.
  Not only morphologically, but also syntactically, are passives
‘losely related to transitive forms. It is the logical unexpressed sub-
ect of a passive sentence, not the grammatical subject (logical and
ormal object), that is referred to by the reflexive possessive in -gwa
‘see §§ 91,92).    Thus:
     dik!olola’n t‘ga'*p'dagwanwa‘ he-was-dug-up their-own-horns (not
        his-own-horns) with (in other words, they dug him up with
        their own horns) 48.5
[here is no real way of expressing the agent of a passive construc-
ion. The commonest method is to use a periphrasis with xebe’*n

                    § 67. VERBS    OF   MIXED      CLASS,   CLASS   IV
   A fairly considerable number of verbs are made up of forms that
delong partly to Class I or Class II intransitives, partly to the transi-
tives. These may be conveniently grouped together as Class IV, but
are again to be subdivided into three groups. A few instransitive
verbs showing forms of both Class I and II have been already
spoken of (pp. 162-3, 166).
  1. Probably the. larger number is taken up by Type 13 verbs in
n-, all the forms of which are transitives except those with second
person singular or plural subject. These latter are forms of Class
II (i.e., aorist singular -dam, plural -dap‘; future singular -da‘, plural
       :                                                                   § 67

(aorist -na‘n and -nana‘k‘), yet its absence in the other persons may,
though not probably, be due to a secondary loss induced by the pho.
netic conditions. The forms, though in part morphologically transi-
tive (and, for some of the verbs, apparently so in meaning), are in
effect intransitive. The object, as far as the signification of the verb
allows one to grant its existence, is always a pronominally unexpressed
third person, and the instrumental -i- can not be used before the
personal endings. Among these semitransitives in -n- are:
      gwen-sgut!u'sgat‘na‘n I cut necks
      gwen-sgut!u’sgat‘ he cut necks 144.2 (cf. transitive instrumentals
         gwen-waya-sgut!u’sgidi’n, gwen-waya-sgut!u’sgat't 144.3)
      {orper !oba’k‘na‘n I make bubbles (or da-bok !o’p'na'n 102.22)
       da-bok!o’p‘dam you make bubbles
       ba*-xada’xat‘na‘n I hang them up in row

       da-dagada’k‘na‘n I sharpen my teeth (126. 18)
       tigi’‘ak‘na‘n I always drink it
       wagao’k‘na‘n I always bring it 43.16; 45.6)
   Morphologically identical with these, yet. with no trace of transitive
signification, are:
       t-hegwe'hak‘’na‘n I am working
      {2a tege nak nen I breathe (78.12; 79.1, 2, 4)

by a very few verbs that have their aorist like 7-hegwe’hak‘na‘n,

ver between Class II, to which they seem properly to belong, and
: semi-transitive -n- forms.   Such are:
   di-k!tala’snafn (but also      : future di-k/a’lsidee
      di-k!ala’sde®) I am lean
      in my rump

       no flesh on my legs and
      feet
It may be observed that the existence of a form like *gwel-sal-t!et-
van was denied, so that we are not here dealing with a mere mis-
xen mixture of distinct, though in meaning identical, verbs.
3. The most curious set of verbs belonging to Class IV is formed
‘a. small number of intransitives, as far as signification is concerned,
th a thoroughly transitive aorist, but with non-aorist forms
longing entirely to Class II. This is the only group of verbs in
lich a difference in tense is associated with a radical difference in
iss. Examples are:                                          .
    da*-sgek !iya’'n I listened    : future da@*-sge’klit‘e®

                                        klalp‘k’)
    al-geyana’*n I turn away      : future al-ge’yande®
      my face
    cremayome ‘2 h smile                                future da-sma-ima’sde®
       smayanihasn.
    da-smayam he smiles
    da-smayamana‘k‘ we smile
 To these should probably be added also da-sgayana’‘n I lie down
d da-sgayat), though no future was obtained. Here again it may
noted that the existence of *da-sma-ima’n as a possible (and indeed
‘be expected) future of da-smayama’'n was denied.’
There are in Takelma also a number of logically intransitive verbs with transitive forms throughout
the tense-modes: al-raliyana‘k' WE ARE SEATED (56.2; 150.20); passive al-zaliya’n PEOPLE ARE SEATED
18 Similar is sal-rogwt THEY STAND; cf. also gel-hewe’hau HE THINKS, p.179,note 1. As these, howe
2, have nothing to mark them off morphologically from ordinary transitives, they give no occasion
 special treatment. It is probable that in them the action is conceived of as directed toward some
plied third personal object.

                      § 68. PERIPHRASTIC FUTURES
  Periphrastic future forms are brought about by prefixing to th
third personal (unexpressed) objective forms of the aorist ste
-gulug”- DESIRE, INTEND the verb-stem (if transitive, with its append
pronominal object) of the verb whose future tense is desired. Th
pronominal subject of such a form is given.by the transitive subject)
pronoun of the second element (-gulug’-) of the compound; while
the object of the whole form, if the verb is transitive, is coincident
with the incorporated pronominal object-of the first element. Th
form of the verb-stem preceding the -gulug”- suffix is identical wi
the form it takes in the inferential.        Thus:
       ba-i-hema’k'ulu‘k'” he will take it out (cf. inferential ba-i-he}
         ma‘k‘ =-hemg-k‘), but imperative ba-1-he‘mk* 16.10
but, without inorganic a:
     i-hémgulu‘k’” he will wrestle with him (cf. inferential hémk‘)
Indeed, it is quite likely that the main verb is used in the inferential
form, the -k‘ of the inferential amalgamating with the g- of -gulug*-
to form g ork‘.      This seems to be proved by the form:
       loho’k'-di-gulugwa‘t' do you intend to die? (di= interrogative par
          ticle)                                                 ,
  Morphologically the verb-stem with its incorporated object must
itself be considered as a verb-noun incorporated as a prefix in the
verb -gulug’- and replacing the prefix gel- Breast of gel-gulugwa'n
I DESIRE     IT 32.5, 6, 7.     Alongside,     e. g., of the ordinary     future
form     dé“ma'n I SHALL      KILL   HIM     may     be used   the periphrastic
do""m-gulugwa’'n literally, 1 KILL (HIM)-DESIRE, INTEND. This latter
form is not by any means a mere desiderative (I DESIRE TO KIL
HIM would be expressed by dé“mia‘ gel-gulugwa’'n [ =TO-KILL-HM
I-IT-DESIRE]), but a purely formal future. Similarly, dimazi-gulu‘s""
is used alongside of the simpler dimzink' He WILL KILL ME. As
matter of fact the third personal subjective future in -gulu‘k'yis
used about as frequently as the regular paradigmatic                forms here
tofore given:
       yana’-k‘ulu‘k‘” he will go (128.9)
       sana’ p‘-gulu‘k’” he will fight (cf. 48.10)
       yomo'k‘wagulu‘k'” she was about to catch up with him 140.18

Boas]              HANDBOOK      OF INDIAN LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                        185The         reason is obvious.        The normal futures      (yana’*t' HE WILL GO;
sana’ p‘da*; alzi'‘xbink‘) imply a bald certainty, as it were, of the
future action of a third person, a certainty that is not in ordinary
life generally justifiable. The periphrastic forms, on the other hand,
have a less rigid tone about them, and seem often to have a slight
intentive force: HE INTENDS, 1S ABOUTTO GO.                  The difference between
the two futures may perhaps be brought out by a comparison with
the English 1 sHALL KILL HIM (=d6""ma’n) and I’M GOING TO KILL HIM
(do“m-gulugwa’'n).
  Though a form like dimazi-gulu‘k'Y HE WILL KILL ME is in a
way analogous to s‘in-i-lets!e’xi HE TOUCHES MY NOSE, the incor-
porated object dimai- Km.-mME of the former being parallel to
s‘in- NOSE of the latter, there is an important difference between
the two in that the object of the periphrastic future is always asso-
ciated with the logically (do“m-), not formally (-gulug’-), main verb.
This difference may be graphically expressed as follows: HE-KILL-
ME]-INTENDS-IT, but HE-[NOSE-HAND]-TOUCHES-ME; strict analogy
with the latter form would require *d6%m-giilii’xi HE-[ KILL]-INTENDS-
ME, a type of form that is not found. It is not necessary to give a
paradigm of periphrastic future forms, as any desired form can be
readily constructed from what has already been said. The incorpo-
rated pronominal object is always independent of the subject-suffix, so
 that YOU WILL KILL ME, for example, is rendered by déimzi-gulugwa‘t’,
 the ordinary rou—mMz forms (singular -dam, plural -dap‘) finding no
 place here.
    Inasmuch as all active periphrastic futures are transitive in form,
 passive futures of the same type (all ending in -gulugwa’n) can be
 formed from all verbs, whether transitive or intransitive. When
 formed from transitive stems, these forms are equivalent to the
 normal future passives in -(a)na*:
            d6""m-gulugwa’n he will, is about to, is going to be killed
      diimzi-gulugwa’n I am to be killed, it is intended to kill me
 As the intransitive stem in the periphrastic future is never accom-
 panied by pronominal affixes, there is only one passive future form
 that        can   be   constructed     from   an   intransitive   verb.   This    form
 always refers to the third person, generally to the intended or immi-
 nent action of a group of people:
      hoida-gulugwa’n (verb-stem hoid- + inorganic -a-) there will be
              dancing
                                                                                  § 68

       intended)
The passive future in -gulugwa’n can also be used with the indefinite
form in -iau-:
    sana’ziniau-gulugwa’n it is intended, about to be that people
          fight one another; there will be fighting
The extreme of abstract expression seems to be reached in such not
uncommon forms as:
      we'¢giau-gulugwa'n it was going to be daylight (literally, it was
      being-daylight intended) 48.13
As the suffixed pronominal objects of reciprocal forms                                     are    intran-
sitive in character, the first element of a periphrastic future of the
reciprocal must show an incorporated intransitive pronoun,                                         but of
aorist, not future form:
      i-di-lasgi’xant'p ‘-gulugwa't p‘ are you going to touch one another!

hitherto been translated as say (intransitive), say TO (transitive).
This, however, is only a specialized meaning of the constantly,
recurring base, its more general signification being po, ACT, BE IN
MOTION indefinitely. It is really never used alone, but is regularly
accompanied by some preceding word or phrase with which it is
connected in @ periphrastic construction; the na(g)- form playing
the part of an auxiliary. As a verb of saying, na(g)- is regularly
preceded by & quotation, or else some word or phrase, generally a
demonstrative pronoun, grammatically summarizing the quotation.
Properly speaking, then, a sentence like 1 SHALL GO, HE SAID (TO ME)
(=yana’t'e* [ga] naga’ [or nege’s't]) is rendered in Takelma by1
SHALL GO (THAT) HE DID (or HE DID TO ME), in which the quotation
yana’t'e® 1 SHALL GO, or else its representative ga THAT, is incorpo-
rated as prefix in the general verb of action.
   The most interesting point in connection with periphrastic phrases
in na(g)- is the use of a number of invariable, generally monosyl-
labic, verbal bases as incorporated prefixes. The main idea, logic-
ally speaking, of the phrase is expressed in the prefix, the na(g)-
   1Most of its forms, as far as known, are listed, for convenience of reference, in Appendix A, pp. 286-90.
It will be seen to be irregular in several respects.   Examples of its forms are to be found in great number
in ‘Takelma Texts.”

identical with that       so   frequently   employed   in Chinookan    dia-
ts, where significant uninflected particles are joined into peri-
rastic constructions with some form of the verb-stem -2- DO, MAKE,
COME (e. g., Wasco ?q/u’b itciuz HE CUT IT [literally, cur HE-IT-
.DE]), except that in Takelma the particles are identical with the
ses of normally formed verbs.          It is not known how many such —
rb-particles there are, or even whether they are at all numerous.
ie few examples obtained are:
     na* do (cf. na’t'e® I shall say, do)

he last two are evidently representatives of a whole class of quasi-
iverbial -k‘-derivatives from verb-stems, and, though syntactically
milar to the rest, hardly belong to them morphologically. The -k‘
' these invariable verb-derivatives can hardly be identified with
ie inferential -k', as it is treated differently. Thus:

 Most frequently employed of those listed is na*, which is in all
robability nothing but the base na- po, to forms of which it is itself
refixed; its function is to make of the base na(g)- a pure verb of
ction or motion in contradistinction to the use of the latter as a verb

                                 §79. Introductory
  Four suffixes have been found that are employed to form nouns
of agency from verb-stems, -‘s, -s@*, -si#, and -2i. The first of these
is more strictly verbal in character than the other three, being capable,
unlike these, of incorporating the pronominal object. -sd* and -si',
probably genetically related suffixes, are used apparently only with
intransitive stems (including, however, such as are partly transitive |
in form, i.e., that belong toClassIV).  -*s and -2i are used with both
transitive and intransitive stems.
                         § 80. Nouns of Agency in -(a’)és   This suffix is used to form agentives with more freedom than the
others seem to be. The ending -‘s is added directly to the verb-stem.
with connective -a’- (instrumental -2-) if phonetically necessary. No
examples have been found of agentives in -'s from intransitives of
Class II.   Examples are (49.4; 60.10):
      hoida’‘s dancer                          hapzi-t‘d*ga’‘s child-crier (=
                                                  cry-baby)

‘st indicated by its employment as a final clause. Examples of
is use are:
      ba-i-k liyi’k‘de® al-xi’*xbits I came to see you (literally, as one-
         seeing-you)
      me'-gini'k* al-xi’*ziés he came to see me
      hoida’‘s di me‘-giniga‘t' did you come to dance? (i. e., as dancer)
      a’naé me'-gini’k‘de® l6“s- I did not come to play, as player 31.6
         (cf. § 74 for another method of expressing this idea)
                        § 81. Nouns   of Agency   in -s/?, -saa
 These, as already observed, are less distinctly verbal in force than
e preceding.    Some verbs have agentives in both -‘s and -sd*; e. g.,
‘la’és and hélsé* stnceR.   Not infrequently there is a distinct feel-
g of disparagement in a -sd?- agentive as compared with one in -‘s;
 g., hog’a’’s GOOD RUNNER, but ho’k'sé* ONE WHO ALWAYS RUNS’
‘/ECAUSE OF FEAR). Both of these suffixes are added directly to the
em without connecting vowel.         If stressed, they have the falling
‘cent. -sd* is the regular agentive ending of Class II intransitives;
‘-is or is not retained before it under the same conditions as in
ie case of the participial -t‘ (see § 76).
Further examples of agentives in -si‘ and -sd* are:
      1-he°gwa’k‘“si! worker

  Two or three isolated verb-forms in -i’ya! have                               been found that
appear to be of a passive participial character.                       There are not enough
such forms available, however, to enable one to form an idea, of ther
function.    The few examples are:
     t'gG* (1) hazani’ya (2) mi (8) al-tlaya‘k’ (4) then (8) he dis
        covered (4) a burnt-down (2) field (1) 92.26
     yapla (1) dé“mi'ya (2) ‘al-tlaya‘k‘ (3) he discovered (3) ile
         (2) people (1)
   Both of these forms in -i’ya, it will be observed, are derived from
transitive stems (hazani’ya from causative haza-n- CAUSE TO BURY,
BURN), and would seem to be best interpreted as attributive passive
corresponding to the attributive actives in -t'. To these form
belongs probably also:
     di'-he'liya (1) wa-iwi/t (2) girl (2) who sleeps on a, raised board
        platform (1) (literally, perhaps, up-boarded girl [cf. he‘la'n

   Despite the double-faced character of some of the nominal derivs
tives of the verb-stem (e. g., the passive participles), there is formally
in Takelma a sharp line of demarcation between denominating and
predicative elements of speech. This is evidenced partly by th
distinct sets of pronominal suffixes peculiar to noun and verb, an
by certain nominal elements appearing before the possessive
and serving, perhaps, to distinctly substantivize the stem.                              Only

minal (or verbal) derivative elements, be used as both nouns and

   2ain urine                  ;     xala’zam-t‘e I urinate
A number of cases have been found of stem + suffix serving as noun
d verb (e. g., wiitlha‘m MENSTRUAL “ROUND” DANCE 100.10, 16:
i‘Tha’mt'e* I SHALL HAVE FIRST COURSES 162.7, 8); but in these it
 probable that the verb is a secondary derivative of the noun.
ven in the first two examples given above, a difference in pitch-
cent serves to distinguish the noun from the verb-stem: hél-gulu‘k‘
1 WILL SING, but he’ ¢l gel-gulu‘k'” HE LIKES, DESIRES, A SONG. The
e of a stem as both noun and verb in the same sentence may
ad to such cognate accusative constructions as the English To LIVE
LIFE, DREAM A DREAM:
   se’ l-se‘la’msi write to me!
   dii“gwi'' di-dii“gwa‘nk‘ she shall wear her skirt 55.9
If we analyze noun forms like t/ibagwa‘nt‘k’ My PANCREAS               and
nade‘k‘ MY EAR, we find it necessary to consider five more or less
stinct elements that go to make up a noun with possessive suffix,
ough all of these but the radical portion of the word may be absent.
First of all we have the stem (t/iba-; da*-) which may or may
it be similar in form to a verbal base, and which occurs either as
. absolute noun unprovided with a pronominal suffix (body-part
runs and terms of relationship, however, do not ordinarily appear in
eir naked stem-form), or as an incorporated noun; e. g., ¢/iba-wésin
\M PANCREAS-DEPRIVED, MY PANCREAS HAS BEEN TAKEN FROM ME.
Appended to the stem are the purely derivational or formative
ments of the noun. Takelma is characterized rather by a paucity
an an abundance of such elements, a very large proportion of its
nuns being primitive, i. e., non-derivative,     in character.      Of the
                                                                    § 84

tive element in the proper sense of the word, while the -gw- of t!i
gwa‘nt‘k‘ is such an element (cf. from stem [tu- Loox liu-gw-ard
MY FACE).
  More characteristic of the Takelma noun than derivational suffi
is a group of elements that are never found in the absolute form
the noun, but attach themselves to it on the addition of a pronomi
suffix or local pre-positive.   The -n- and -(a)n- of da*nzde‘k' :
thbagwa‘nt'k’, respectively, are elements of this kind (cf. ha-da-
IN MY EAR; ha-t!ibagw-an-dé IN MY PANCREAS), also the -a- of dana'
MY ROCK     (cf. ha-dan-a‘ IN THE ROCK [from da‘n rock]), and the ~
ha-t‘g@0 IN THE EARTH 33.7 (from t‘g@ EARTH).    The function of tk
elements, if they have any and are not merely older formative suffi
that have become crystallized in definite forms of the noun, is
at all clear.   They are certainly not mere connective elements se
ing as supports for the grammatical suffixes following, as in t
event it would be difficult to understand their occurrence as absol
finals in nouns provided with pre-positives; norcan they be plausi
explained as old case-endings whose former existence as such °
conditioned by the preceding pre-positive, but which now h
entirely lost their original significance, for they are never depend
on the pre-positive itself, but vary solely with the noun-stem:
      ha-dan-a‘ in the rock; d@*-dan-a‘ beside the rock; dal-da:
         among the rocks; dan-a‘-t'k* my rock; dak‘-dan-a-dé over
        rock (with constant -a- from da‘n rock 16.12)
      ha-gwa‘l-a‘m in the road 62.6; da*-gwa*l-a‘m along the ro
        gwal-a‘m-t'k* my road (96.8); dak‘-gwa*l-am-dé over my r
         (48.6, 8) (with constant -am- from gwan road 148.7)
For want of a better term to describe them, these apparently n
significant elements will be referred to as noun-characterist
Not all nouns have such characteristics:
      ha-gela‘m in the river (from gela‘m river 21.14) as opposed to:
        guim-a‘n among oaks (from gulu‘m oak 22.10, 11)
Whether such nouns were always without them, or really prese
them, but in a phonetically amalgamated          form, it is, of cow
impossible to decide without other than internal evidence.
   A fourth nominal element, the pre-pronominal -z-, is found i
large number of nouns, including such as possess also a characteri:

‘those that have a characteristic (e. g., tibagw-a‘n-t'k') and of
tose that lack it (e. g., bém-é'a* HIs sTICK) do without the -z-. A
msiderable number of nouns may either have it between the
\aracteristic and the pronominal ending or append the personal
idings directly to the characteristic, no difference in signification
sulting. In such doublets, however, the pronominal suffixes be-
ng to different schemes:                             :
      bilg-an-z-de‘k* and bilg-a‘n-t'k* my breast
      se°ns-i-z-da’* and se¢ns-2’-t' your hair
      wad-0'-x-da (92.24) and wa*d-i’t his: body 146.6
he characteristic -a- never tolerates a following -z-. Where doublets
‘cur, these two elements seem to be mutually equivalent: ey-a‘-tk*
12.6) and e2-x-de‘k* my CANOE (from ef CANOE 114.3).        Such doublets,
gether with the fact that nothing ever intervenes between it and the
‘rsonal suffix, make it possible that this -z- is a connective element
mewhat similar in function to, and perhaps ultimately identical
ith, the connective -z- of transitive verbs.       This, however, is con-
ssedly mere speculation. What chiefly militates against its inter-
‘etation as a merely connective element is the fact of its occurrence
| a word-final in phrases in which no possessive element is found:

sappears:

      pronominal element (ha-gwa*l-am-dé).
4. Pre-pronominal -x-. Occurs with pronominal suffix (da*12-
      de‘k‘) and pre-positive (ha-da*-n-z), but never with pre-positive
      and pronominal element.
5. Pronominal                suffix.         Occurs in two            distinct     forms:           one for
      nouns without pre-positives (da*-n-z-de‘k'), and one for nouns
      accompanied by pre-positive (ha-da-n-dé).

  1 Though these forms are simply derivatives of intransitive aorist naga(i)-, verb-stem na-, they have been
listed here because of their great similarity to transitive frequentatives, with which they might be easily
confused. In the aorist, the two sets of forms differ in the length of the second (repeated) vowel, in the
connecting consonant, and to some extent in the place of the accent, though this is probably a minor cone
sideration. In the future, they differ in the connecting consonant and partly again in the place of theaccent.

that add possessive pronominal suffixes of Scheme II directly to stem.         With suffixed ({?] pre-pronominal)
-t- it becomes plural in signification: hdprda HIS CHILDREN.       This sort of plural formation stands, as far as

loho-. -k' inferential element.     Inferential mode used because statement is here not made on personal
authority, but only as tradition or hearsay.     According to this, all myth narrative should employ inferential
forms instead of aorist. This myth employs partly inferentials and partly sorists; but in most other
 myths sorists are regularly employed, probably because they are more familiar forms, and perhaps, also,
 because myths may be looked upon as well-authenticated fact.

nagait'et Type 491 SAY; aorist stem nagai-, verb-stem na-. Both transitive and intransitive formsof na(g)-
sayincorporate object of thing said; ga in gas-it (2) is incorporated as direct objectin nak'ik' (it would be
theoretically more correct to write ga [-s'if} nak'ik'); while quotation ‘‘laps . . . yimi’zi’’ is syntactically
direct object of naga’-ihit which, as such, it precedes. ga-ndk‘ik' anticipates ‘‘laps . . . yimi’zi’’ naga’-

  The child of Roasting-dead-people died.  He and Coyote were
neighbors to each other. Thereupon he said to him, ‘Lend me a
blanket, for my child has died. Lend mea blanket,” said Roasting-
dead-people.   ‘‘ I'll not lend you a blanket, for where are they going
to be, if dead people come back?” said Coyote. And next door
returned Roasting-dead-people, and buried his child that had died.
  Then, ’tis said, a long time elapsed. Now Coyote’s child became
sick and died. Now next door he went to Roasting-dead-people.
‘‘Lend me a blanket, for my child has died.”—‘‘ What did you say?”
Roasting-dead-people said that. ‘‘ Yesterday indeed when I did say
to you, ‘Lend me a blanket,’ you, for your part, did say that to me,
‘Where will the people be, if they return?’ Now my child is rot-
ting,” said Roasting-dead-people. So next door Coyote returned.
“Sga+!” he cried. For that reason people do not nowadays return
when they die.

                                         [Translation]   The people are making a house. A post they set in the ground,
and here again they set one in the ground, yonder again they set one
in the ground, in four places they set them in the ground. Then
also they place beams across on top in four places, and above (these)
they put one across just once. And just then they make the house
wall; and then on top they place the house boards, those they make
out of sugar-pine lumber.    Then they finish it on top, on either side
they finish it. Then they make the door, and on top they make a
hole for the going out of the smoke. And then they make a ladder,
they notch out (a pole), for going down to the floor they make it;
and the house wall they make.
  Then they finish it, all cleaned inside.                 Now rush mats they spread
out inside, on such the people sit.                The fireplace is in the center, so
that they are seated on either side of the fire.                     In that way, indeed,
was the house of the people long ago; in winter their house was such.
But in summer they were sitting like now,' not in the house. Just
a brush shelter they placed around, so that the fireplace they made
in the middle.       Thus they dwelt in summer, not as in winter in a
house.

activity predicated, but is rather considered as indirectly responsible
for it. Thus, from the aorist stem t‘gwilik!w- (t‘gwili’*-2 WATER,
BLOOD DROPS, DRIPS 58.1) are formed:
        pla-i-t'‘guili’k!wana‘n I (voluntarily) drop, spill it
        pla-i-t'gwili’*xna‘n T have it drop (unavoidably), spill it (72.8,16)                                  § 57. Positional-i/-   As we have already seen (§ 40, 15), this suffix, though of clearly
derivational character, is generally, probably always, confined to the
aorist. A positional verb in -i/- may be defined as expressing the
state or condition resulting from the completed action of a transitive
or non-agentive; e. g., p/a-t-ha-u-t'‘gup!idt IT (BOX-LIKE OBJECT) LIES
UPSIDE DOWN is a verb expressing the result of the action defined in
pla-i-ha-u-t' gii/""ba‘n I UPSET IT and p/a-i-ha-u-t'gii'“pz IT UPSET 60.8.
From one point of view the suffix -7'- serves to mark off a class of purely
positional verbs, a different verb-stem being used for each general
form-category of the object described. Such verbs of position are:
        dinkli long, stretched out object lies (transitive aorist dinik!-)
        t‘geits'!i round object lies (138.24) (¢‘geyets:!-)
        p'udi flat object lies’
        tlobigi corpse, dead-looking body lies
        s‘eini box-like object with opening on top lies
        pla-i-ha-u-t'gup!idi     box-like   object       with   opening   below   lies
           (t'gui""b-)
        s‘ugwidi curled-up object (like bundle of rope) lies
        da-sgali scattered objects (like grain on floor) lie
        wik lidi several objects heaped together lie (wi‘g-)
        s‘asini erect object is, he stands 34.1; 45.12; 77.9
        su'wili sitting object (person) is, he sits, dwells 21.1; 57.2
        k‘ebili absent object is, he is long absent 124.20
   Not so clearly positional are:
        la*li (generally heard as la*lé‘) it becomes 33.17; 45.3
        yamli he looks pretty
   Of these verbs those that are directly derived from transitives, it
will be observed, use in the aorist the verb-stem, not the aorist stem,
of their simplex (thus dink!-, not dinik!-). The derivational -(a)d-
(see § 42, 4) that seems to characterize a number of positional verbs
 can not be explained.
                                                                             57 §

                            § 59. INTRODUCTORY
  Every Takelma verb except, so far as known, the defective copula
eit‘e’ 1 aM,    has forms of six tense-modes—aorist, future, potential,
inferential, present imperative, and future imperative. Of these, all
but the aorist, which is built up on a derived aorist stem, are formed
from the verb-stem. A special tense or mode sign, apart from the
peculiar stem      of the aorist, is found        in none   of the tense-modes
except the inferential, which, in all the voices, is throughout charac-
terized by a -k‘-(-g-) following the objective, but preceding the sub-
jective, pronominal elements.         Each of the tense-modes except the
potential, which uses the personal endings of the aorist, is, however,
characterized by its own set of pronominal endings.               It is for thig
very reason that it has seemed best to use the term tense-modes for
the various modes and tenses, instead of attempting a necessarily
artificial classification into tenses       (aorist and future)     and modes
(indicative, potential,     imperative,     and   inferential), the method           of
distinguishing     the latter being       fundamentally     the same            as that
employed       to form the former, i. e., the use of special pronominal
schemes.
  The purely temporal idea is only slightly developed in the verb.
The aorist does duty for the preterite (including the narrative past),
the present, and the immediate future, as in Now I SHALL GO; while
the future is employed to refer to future time distinctly set off from
the present, as in I SHALL GO THIS EVENING, TO-MORROW.                 A        similar
distinction between the immediate and more remote future is made
in the imperative. The present imperative expresses a command
which, it is intended, is to pass into more or less immediate fulfill-
ment, as in Go away! while the command                expressed   by the future

158      :         BUREAU    OF AMERICAN      ETHNOLOGY               [putt.49 {imperative is not to be carried out until some stated or implied point
of time definitely removed from the immediate present, as in CoME |
TO-MORROW!, GIVE HER TO EAT (when she recovers).            The uses of the
potential and inferential will be best illustrated by examples given
after the forms themselves have been tabulated. In a general way
the potential implies the ability to do a thing, or the possibility of
the occurrence of a certain action or condition (I CAN, COULD Go if I
care, cared to), and thus is appropriately used in the apodosis of an
unfulfilled or contrary-to-fact condition; it is also regularly employed
in the expression of the negative imperative (prohibitive). The |
peculiar form of the potential (verb-stem with aorist pronoun endings)
seems in a measure to reflect its modal signification, the identity of
its stem with that of the future indicating apparently the lack of
fulfillment of the action, while the aoristic pronominal elements may
be interpreted as expressing the certainty of such fulfillment under
the expressed or implied circumstances         by the person referred to.
  The inferential implies that the action expressed by the verb is not
directly known or stated on the authority of the speaker, but is only
inferred from the circumstances of the case or rests on the authority
of one other than the speaker.      Thus, if I say THE BEAR KILLED THE
MAN, and wish to state the event as a mere matter of fact, the truth
of which is directly known from my own or another’s experience, the
aorist form would normally be employed:
      mena‘ (bear) yapla (man) tlomék'wa (it killed him)
If I wish, however, to imply that it is not definitely known from
unmistakable evidence that the event really took place, or that it is
inferred from certain facts (such as the finding of the man’s corpse
or the presence of a bear’s footprints in the neighborhood of the
house), or that the statement is not made on my own authority, the
inferential would be employed:
      mena’ yap!a démk‘wak‘ it seems that the bear killed the man; ,
        the bear must have, evidently has, killed the man
Inasmuch as mythical narration is necessarily told on hearsay, one |
would expect the regular use of the inferential in the myths; yet,
in the great majority of cases, the aorist was employed, either because
the constant use of the relatively uncommon inferential forms would
have   been   felt as intrusive   and   laborious,   or because   the events
related in the myths are to be looked upon as objectively certain.

iture.
 Not only do the pronominal elements vary for the different tense-
iodes, but they change also for the two main classes of intransitive
erbs and for the transitive (subject and object), except that in the
resent imperative and inferential no such class-differences are
iscernible, though even in these the characteristic -p‘- of Class II
itransitives brings about a striking formal, if not strictly personal,
ifference.     We thus have the following eleven pronommal schemes to
eal with:
 Aorist subject intransitive I.
 Aorist subject intransitive II.
 Aorist subject transitive.
 Future subject intransitive I.
 Future subject intransitive IT.
 Future subject transitive.
 Inferential subject.
 Present imperative subject.
 Future imperative subject intransitive I and transitive.
 Future imperative subject intransitive IT.
 Object transitive (and subject passive).
 The transitive objects are alike for all tense-modes, except that
1e combination of the first person singular object and second person
ngular or plural subject (i. e., THOU or YE ME) always agrees with
te corresponding subject form of intransitive II. Not all the per-
mal forms in these schemes stand alone, there being a number of
itercrossings between the schemes of the three classes of verbs. The
otal number of personal endings is furthermore greatly lessened by
1e absence of a dual and the lack of a distinct plural form for the
iird person.     The third person subject is positively characterized
y 8 distinct personal ending only in the aorist subject intransitive I,
te future subject intransitive I, the future subject intransitive II,
nd the future subject transitive; as object, it is never characterized
t all, except in so far as the third person object, when referring to
uman beings, is optionally indicated by a special suffix -k‘wa-
‘gwa-). In all other cases the third person is negatively characterized
y the absence of a personal ending. The second singular subject of
le present imperative is similarly negatively characterized by the
bsence of a personal ending, though the -p'‘ of the present imperative
transitive II superficially contradicts this statement (see § 61).

"                                § 8. I- UMLAUT
   Probably the most far-reaching phonetic law touching the Takelma
vowels is an assimilatory process that can be appropriately termed
“¢- umlaut.”’ Briefly stated, the process is a regressive assimilation
of a non-radical -a- to an -1-, caused by an -7- (-7-) in an immediately
following suffixed syllable, whether the -i- causing the umlaut is an
original -i-, or itself umlauted from an original -a-; the -i- of the
       §§ 7-8                           |
Boas]           HANDBOOK      OF INDIAN       LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                   25pronominal endings -bi- THEE, -si- HE TO ME, -zi- HE ME, fails to
cause umlaut, nor does the law operate when the -7- is immediately
preceded by an inorganic h. The following forms will make the
applicability of the rule somewhat clearer:
      waklayayini’'n I caused him to grow with it (but k/ayayana’*n
        I caused him to grow, with preserved -a-, because of following
        -a’*n, not -2’£n)
    ‘ wak leyeya’nai he caused me to grow with it
    \ wak !ayaya’nxbién I caused thee to grow with it
         tyulu’yilitn I rub it (from -yalién) -
     -tyulu’yalhi he rubs it
It should be carefully noted that this i- umlaut never operates on a
radical or stem-vowel, a fact that incidentally proves helpful at times
in determining how much of a phonetic complex belongs to the stem,
and how much is to be considered as belonging to the grammatical
apparatus following the stem. In:
     wa?giur''n I brought it to him (from -awi’'n; cf. wa*ga’sbitn
        I brought it to you)
the -a- following the g is shown to be not a part of the aoristic stem
wa°g- by the 7- umlaut that it may undergo;                on the other hand, the
corresponding future shows an un-umlauted -a-:
         wagawi’n I shall bring it to him
so that the future stem must be set down as waga-, as is confirmed by
certain other considerations.
   It would take us too far afield to enumerate all the possible cases
in which 7- umlaut takes place; nevertheless, it is a phenomenon of.
such frequent recurrence that some of the more common possibilities
should be listed, if only for purposes of further illustration:
   (1)     It is caused by the aoristic verb suffix -7‘- denoting position:
         s‘as‘int he stands (cf. s:a’s‘ant‘a* he will stand)
         t!obigt he lies as if dead     (cf. future ¢/obaga’sda*)
  (2) By an element -7- characteristic of certain nouns, that is added
to the absolute form of, the noun before the possessive pronominal
endings:
         babinet'k' my arm      (cf. bé”ba‘n arm)
         tga’lt‘gilixdek‘ my belly (for * t‘galt‘gali-)
  (3)      By   the common     verbal       ”” vowel -2-, which, for
                                          “instrumenta
one reason or another, replaces the normal pre-pronominal element

instrumental -i- may work its influence on a great number of preceding
elements containing -a-, among which are:
    (a) The -a- that regularly replaces the stem-vowel in the second
member of a duplicated verb:
       alit‘baga’t bigitn I beat him (cf. -t‘baga’t’bak* he beat him)
      ts: lele’ts: ili*n I rattle it (cf. ts-Jele’ts-!alhi he rattles it)
       ismili’smili*n I swing it (cf. tsmi’Ismal swing it!)
     (b) The causative element -an-:
       wap!a%gini’'n I cause him to swim with it (cf. p/a*gana’*n I cause
         him to swim)
See above:
       waklayayini’'n I cause him to grow
     (c) The element -an- added to transitive stems to express the idea
of FOR, IN BEHALF OF:
       wat!omomini’en I kill it for him with it (cf. t!omomana’‘n I kill it
         for him)
     (d) The pronominal element -am-, first personal plural object:
       alzt'‘zimiés one who sees us (cf. alzi’‘zam he sees us)
   4. By the suffixed local element -di‘ on Tor oF added to the demon-
strative pronoun ga THAT to form a general local postposition:
       gid‘ on top of it, over (so and so)
Compare the similarly formed:
       gada‘k* above
       gada‘l among
and others.
   5. By the pronominal element -2g- (-ik‘), first personal plural subject
intransitive:
       tlomoxinik* we kill each other (cf. t/omdza‘n they kill each other)
       dazxinigam we shall find each other (cf. dézan‘t‘ they will find each
         other)         :
   This list might be greatly extended if desired, and indeed numerous
other examples will meet usin the morphology.      Examples of a double
and treble 7- umlaut are:
       lohé“ninini’'n I caused him to die (i. e., killed him) for him (cf.
         lohé“nana’nhi he killed him for him)
       tklimininini‘nk‘ he will fix it for him (compare ik/i“ma‘n he
         fixed it)

analogous circumstances, of causing the i- umlaut of a preceding non-
radical a. Examples are:
        daxoyo’riya'n (=-zaya‘n) I scare them around; dazoyo’zxi ( =-xiy
            =-zay) he scares them around

           tives in -k‘wiya (=-k‘waya)
                 § 9. K-SOUNDS      PRECEDED    BY   U- VOWELS          .
   An u- vowel (0, u, %, and diphthongs in -u) immediately preceding a
k- sound (i. e., g, k‘, k!, z) introduces after the latter a parasitic -w-,
which, when itself followed by a vowel, unites with the k- sound to
form a consonant-cluster (gw, k‘w, k!w, cw), but appears, when stand-
ing after a (word or syllabic) final k*, as a voiceless -‘”. The intro-
duction of the excrescent w simply means, of course, that the labial
rounding of the u- vowel lingers on after the articulation of the k-
sound, a phonetic tendency encouraged by the fact that the produc-
tion of the guttural consonant does not, as in the labials and dentals,
necessitate a readjustment of the lips. A few examples will illustrate
the phonetic process:
     gelgulugwa’‘n I desire it
    gelgulu‘k‘ he desires it (contrast gelgula‘k‘ he desired it, without
       the labial affection of the -k* because of the replacement of the
          -u- by an -a-)
        giiawi’* his heart
        dii*guv't‘gwa her dress
        daik‘” woman’s garment
    yo""k!wa* his bones
As also in the upper Chinook dialects (Wasco, Wishram),              where
exactly the same process occurs, the w- infection is often very slight,
and particularly before u- vowels the -w- is, if not entirely absent,
at least barely audible:
        yok!*oya’'n I know it
        yo’k‘yan I shall know it
In one very common word the catch seems to be treated as a k- sound
in reference to a preceding u when itself followed by an ~-:
     s-ufwilz he sits; but
     s-ualt'a* he will sit                                           50

misheard, as s°t*ulz.
                                       § 10. INORGANIC a
   It frequently happens in the formation of words that a vowel
present in some other form of the stem will drop out, or, more accu-
rately expressed, has never been inserted. Consonant-combinations
sometimes then result which are either quite impossible in Takelma
phonetics, or at any rate are limited in their occurrence to certain
grammatical forms, so that the introduction of an “inorganic” -c-,
serving to limber up the consonant-eluster, as it were, becomes neces-
sary. Ordinarily this -a- is inserted after the first consonant; in
certain cases, after the two consonants forming the cluster.      The
theoretical future of gini’k‘deé 1 GO SOMEWHERE should be, for
example, *gink‘de‘; but, instead of this somewhat difficult form,
we really get gina’k‘de*. That the -a’- is here really inorganic, and
not a characteristic of the future stem, as was at first believed, is
clearly shown by the imperative gi‘nk‘ (all imperatives are formed
from the future stem). Similarly:
    kliya’k‘de® I shall go, come; aorist, kliyi’k‘det
    alzik!a’lhik’ (=theoretical *alzik!lk') he kept looking at him;
         aorist first person alzik!ilhitn I keep looking at him
       klema’n make it! (=theoretical *klemn); cf. k!emna’n                                         I shall
           make it
       bai‘iye'wa'n         drive      out        sickness!;    aorist, -yewén he drove                   out
         sickness                             .
       sgela’ut‘e* I shalt shout (=theoretic *sgelwt'e*); aorist second
          person, sgelewa‘t’ you shouted
As an example             of an inorganic -a- following a consonantic cluster
may be given:
       wisma't'e* I shall move (stem wism-) ; aorist, wits: /ifit'e® I moved!
The exact nature of the processes involved in the various forms given
will be better understood when stem-formation is discussed. Here
  18uch an -¢ may stand as an absolute final; e. g., ba-imasga‘ START IN SINGING! (stem masg-), aorist
third pcrson, -mats/a‘k'. The form masga‘ well illustrates the inherent difficulty of delimiting the range of
a phonetic law without comparative or older historical material to aid in determining what is due to regular
phonetic development, and what is formed on the analogy of other forms.       The final cluster -sk* does occur
in Takelma; e. g., dink/a‘sk’ (long object) lay stretched out; so that a phonetic irregularity must exist in
one of the two forms. Either weshould have *ma'‘sk’, or else *dink/asa‘k’ or *dink/asga‘ is to be expected.
On closer examination it is found that the -k in forms like dink/a‘sk' is a grammatical element added on to
the future stem dink/as-; whereas in masga* the -g- belongs in all probability to the stem, and is no added
suffix; at least is not felt as such. It seems evident, then, that the quasi-mechanical juxtaposition of
grammatical elements does not entirely follow the same phonetic lines as organic sound-complexes.","[30, 31, 32, 33, 34]"

ised, though no difference of signification or usage can be traced.
a'plint’ Two         and 2zi’bini‘ THREE           are evident compounds                   of the
impler ga@’*m and zi‘n (seen in ha‘izi‘n EIGHT) and an element -bint*
hat is perhaps identical with -bini‘ of ha’-bini‘ IN THE MIDDLE.
amga’m Four is evidently reduplicated from ga/*m two, the falling
ecent of the second syllable being                     probably due to the former
resence of the catch of the simplex.                    An attempt has been made!
o explain dzhal FIVE as an adjectival form in -al derived from de*-
N FRONT.    The numerals six, SEVEN, EIGHT, and NINE are best con-
idered as morphologically verbs provided with the compound prefix
a%- IN THE HAND              (see § 35, 4), and thus strictly signifying ONE
FINGER)        IS IN THE HAND; TWO, THREE,               FOUR     (FINGERS)        ARE IN THE
tanD.   No explanation can be given of -go‘ in ha‘igo‘ NINE, except
hat it may be an older stem for rour, later replaced, for one reason
r another, by the composite gamga’m tTwo+tTwo.          i/xdil TEN is
est explained as compounded of i-z- HAND (but why not 7éz- as in
iz-de‘k‘ My HAND?) and the dual -di‘l, and as being thus equivalent
0 TWO HANDS.
 It thus seems probable that there are only three simple numeral
tems in Takelma, mi’*s onzE, ga/*m Two, and zi‘n THREE.         All the
est are either evident derivations from these, or else (dzhal probably
nd 2’zdil certainly) descriptive of certain finger-positions.                         While the
rigin of the Takelma system may be tertiary or quinary (if -go* is
he original stem for rouR and déhal is a primary element), the
ecimal feeling that runs through it is evidenced both by the break
t ten and by the arrangement of the numerals beyond ten.
 The teens are expressed by TEN ONE ABOVE (i. e., ten over one), TEN
WO ABOVE; andsoon. ga‘a‘! THERETO may be used instead of gada‘k*
VER.          Twenty is ONE MAN, i. €., BOTH HANDS AND FEET.                           One hun-
red can be plausibly explained as equivalent to ONE MALE PERSON.?
‘he other tens, i. e., thirty to ninety inclusive, are                           expressed by
1American Anthropologist, loc. cit., where FIVE is explained as BEING IN   FRONT, on the basis of the
ethod of fingering used by the Takelma in counting.

it should be noted that the plural of the noun modified is never em |

  The numeral adverbs denoting so AND SO MANY TIMES are derive
from the corresponding cardinals by suffixing -an (often weakene
to -@n) to ga’‘m Two and its derivative gamga’m FouR; -t‘, to zi
THREE; -da‘n, to other numerals (-ada‘n, to those ending in -*m an
-ts!- = -‘s).   haiga@’/*m sEVEN and ha‘izi‘n EIGHT, it will be observe:
do not follow ga’*m and xin in the formation of their numeral adverb:
but add -(a)da‘n.

related and perhaps dialectically equivalent to mi*s-, but no know
grammaticor phonetic process of Takelma enables one toconnect then
ha‘ig6“gada‘n NINE TIMES seems to insert a -ga- between the cardint
and the adverbial suffix -dan.       The most plausible explanation of th
form is its interpretation as NINE (ha‘igo‘) THAT (ga) NUMBER-OF-TIME
(-da‘n), the demonstrative serving as a peg to hang the suffix on.
   From the numeral adverbs are derived, by prefixing ha- 1x,
further series with the signification of IN so AND SO MANY PLACES:
      ha-ga’*mn in two places

SON-IN-LAW! (as vocative) 164.19; and k‘wi’nazd@ MY FOLKS, RELA-

k'wi’narda*).
   The normal pronominal suffix of the third person is -za; -a is found
in only four cases, k/a’sa HIS MATERNAL GRANDPARENT, ha’sa HIS
MATERNAL UNCLE, t‘a/da HIS PATERNAL AUNT, and ha’sda HIS BROTHER-
IN-LAW.   The first two of these can be readily explained as assimi-
lated from *k/a’/sza and             *ha’sza (see § 20, 3):             *t‘adza and         *hasdza;
however, should have become *t‘a’sa and *ha’sa respectively.                                       The
analogy of the first two, which were felt to be equivalent t
stem + -d, on the one side, and that of the related forms in ~¢:
(e. g., t'ad@ and hasd@) on the other, made it possible for t‘a’da anc
ha’sda to replace *t'a’sé and *ha’sa, the more so that a necessary
distinction in form was thus preserved between ha’sa HIS MATERNAI
UNCLE and ha’sda (instead of *ha’sa) HIS BROTHER-IN-LAW.
   The difference in signification between the third personal forms i
-xa and -xagwa (similarly for the other pronominal schemes) will b
readily understood from what has already been said, and need not b
enlarged upon:
      ma'za wa*-himit' he spoke to his (some one else’s) father
      ma/xagwa wa?-himi't' he spoke to his own father
There is small doubt that this -gwa is identical with the indireo
reflexive -gwa of transitive verbs with incorporated object. Form
in -gwan seem to refer to the plurality of either possessor or objec
possessed :                                                                 .

   The causative in -énha- is sometimes usitative in meaning:
        lohénha he used to kill them; Johén he killed them 142.9
  Examples occur of transitives in -n- formed from intransitives in
which no causative notion can be detected:
    da-lénha‘n I lied to him; de-linhizi he lied to me Gntransitive
          da-lét‘e* I shall lie [110.23])

          (162.1); watnhan I shall cause him to sleep, watnha put him
       to sleep! 106.4,8
  The connective a of the causative suffix -an- in the aorist iis treated
differently from the a of the non-aorist forms in so far as in the
former case the -an- diphthong, when stressed, réceives a raised
accent, while in the latter the a, as a strictly inorganic element, takes
the falling accent.               Thus:
                        Aorist                                         Non-aorist

     (plagén he bathed him [186.25]) + p/d*ga’n bathe him! 186.24
In other words, the phonetic relation between aorist and non-aorist
illustrated by several verb types (e. g., agan- : ag[a}n-) is reflected also
in the causative suffix (-an-: -[a]n-).               The same is true of other -[a]n-
suffixes not causative in signification (see § 42, 19):
                    Aorist                                       Non-torist

TENDED BY, HAVING SOMETHING (expressed by object of verb), may
be formed only from intransitives by the suffix -gw- (final -k'”, rarely
-k'wa in monosyllables); after a consonant (including semivowel) a
connective -a- appears before the -gw-, though in a few cases (as in
sorist yi*n- Go) the -gw- is directly appended. Dissyllabic stems
ending in vowel +-g- or -w- often add the comitative -gw- directly, in

however, are sometimes found with connecting a. The second vowel
of aorist stems is apt to be lengthened in comitative forms, yet not
as consistently as in the case of causatives. Differing in this respect
from the causative -n-, the comitative suffix does not require the loss
of a final aoristic intransitive element (e. g.,-i-). From aorist lohoi-
DIE are formed loho""-n- CAUSE TO DIE, but lohoy-agw- DIE TOGETHER
with. The reason seems clear. While the action of a causative verb
is logically transitive, that of a comitative is really intransitive, and
the verb is only formally transitive. In the former case the subject
of the verb does not undergo the action that would be expressed by
the intransitive stem (lohoi-); in the latter it does. Examples of the
comitative are:

  If the object of the comitative verb is other than a third person, the
uffix -gw- is followed by the indirective -d-, which does not ordinarily
ippear as such, but unites with the immediately following transitive
sonnective -2- to form -s-; a connective -a- is inserted between the
go- and the -s-, so that the whole comitative suffix for a first or
cond personal object is -(a)gwas-.                Examples are:
     dyi’*s‘gwast he laughs at me
     henenagwa’sam he ate us up (192.15)
     ba?-wa-dawiyagwa’sbink* he will fly up with you
The form -gwad- of the comitative suffix appears as such preceding
in- (umlauted from -an-) in the third personal object of indirect For-
‘orms built up on intransitive verbs derived from transitives:
     lik lii/xagwadinin I trap for him (probably = I cause [-in] him
        to be having [-gwad-] [some one] to trap [ik !i-aa-] [for him]) ;
        but lik!ii’xagwasi he traps for me
     pede’xagwadini'n I go to war for him; but p‘ele’zagwasi he goes
         to war for me
(tis highly probable, however, that in such cases the -gwad- is to be
lefinitely analyzed into a comitative element -gwa- + an indirective
‘lement -d- (-t'-) To, For; this seems to be pointed out by the fact
that when the ror - object becomes identical with the subject, i. e.,
when the verb becomes an indirect reflexive (FOR ONE’s SELF), the -d-
immediately precedes the regular reflexive suffix -gwi-, leaving the
causative suffix -(a)n- between it and the comitative suffix -gw-:
       lik ii’ xagwant‘gwide' I trap for myself (probably = I cause [-an-]
         myself [-gwi-] to be having [-gw-] [some one] to trap[lik/i-ca-]

  The obverse, as it were, of these transitive forms in -x-gwa-, is given
by certain rather curious Class I intransitive forms in -2-gwa- built
up on intransitive, not, like normal -z- derivatives, on transitive
stems; they may be literally translated as To BE wiTH (or HAVING!

goal of motion (ME) is treated as the grammatical subject. The.
form quoted would have to be literally translated as 1 AM WITH (0

         yele’'sgwade® (= yelet!-z-gwa-) I am sweating (literally, I am

With such an interpretation, the form dak‘-limtmazgwadini'n |
CHOP IT ON TO HIM becomes readily intelligible as a causative built
  1 ag6/uadet and 896’sgwatn are morphologically quite clearly related, though in signification the latter form
has widely departed from what must have been its primary meaning.","[142, 143, 144, 145, 146]"
"  It is not necessary to give the transitive potential and inferential
orms, as the former can.be easily constructed by substituting in the
uture forms the aorist endings for those of the future:

         d6""m he would, could kill him

   The only point to which attention need be called in the aorist and

   It will have been observed that in all forms but those provided
with a third personal object the endings are not directly added to
the stem, but are joined to it by a connecting consonant -a- (amalge
mating with preceding -t- to -s’-). . This element we have seen to be
identical with the -z- (-s-) of reciprocal forms; and there is a poss
bility of its being related to the -xa- of active intransitive verls,
hardly, however, to the non-agentive -z-. Though it appears ass
purely formal, apparently meaningless element, its original function
must have been to indicate the objective relation in which the
immediately following pronominal suffix stands to the verb. From
this point of view it is absent in a third personal object form simply
because there is no expressed pronominal element for it to obj ectivize,
as it were. The final aoristic consonant of Type 8 verbs regularly
disappears before the connecting -z-, so that its retention become
a probably secondary mark of a third personal pronominal object.
The fact that the third personal objective element -k‘wa- (-gwa-) dow
not tolerate a preceding connective -z- puts it in a class by itself,
affiliating it to some extent with the derivational suffixes of the verb.
   There are, comparatively speaking, few transitive stems ending in
a vowel, so that it does not often happen that the subjective personal
endings, the third personal object being unexpressed, are directly
attached to the verb or aorist stem, as in:
      naga’'n IT say to him 72.9, ef. naga‘ he said to him 92.24
      sebe’n I shall roast it (44.6); future imperative odo’*k* hunt for
       him! (116.7)
Ordinarily forms involving the third personal object require a cor
necting vowel between the stem and the pronominal suffix. Not all
verbs, however, show the purely non-significant -a- of, e. g., t!omoma’'n,
but have a toa large extent probably functional -i-. This -2- occurs
first of all in all third personal object forms of verbs that have an
instrumental prefix:                                          .
      ts!ayaga’*n I shoot him (192.10), but wa-ts/ayagi’n I shoot (him)

his head, so that the -i- may be conveniently termed INSTRUMENTAL
+. Not all forms with --, by any means, can be explained, how-
ver, as instrumental in force.            A great many verbs, many of them
haracterized by the directive prefix al- (see § 36, 15), require an -i-
s their regular connecting vowel:
       lagagi’*n I gave him to eat (30.12)
       la*liwi’'n I call him by name (116.17)
       louginini/n I trap them for him (and most other           For-indirec-
         tives in -anan-)
ixamples of -i-verbs with indirect object are:
   ogoy’'n I give it to him 180.11 (contrast oyona’‘n I gave it [180.20])
   waegiwi’'n I brought it to him (176.17) (contrast wa%ga’én I
         brought it [162.13])
i number of verbs have -a- in the aorist, but -i- in all other tense-
nodes:
    yi'miya’*n T lend it to him, but yim’hin I shall lend it to him
       naga’*n I said to him     (second -a- part of stem)   72.9, but na%gi’ n
         I shall say to him; n@*gi’*k‘ say to him! (future) 196.20; nak‘ik'
         he said to him (inferential) 94.16; 170.9; 172.12
 The general significance of -i- seems not unlike that of the prefixed
lirective al-, though the application of the former element is very
auch wider; i. e., it refers to action directed toward some person or
bject distinctly outside the sphere of the subject. Hence the -i- is
ever found used together with the indirect reflexive -k‘wa-, even
hough this suffix is accompanied by an instrumental prefix:
       2°-p!t*-no'""k'watn I warm my own back (188.20)
na few cases the applicability of the action of the verb can be                   '
hifted from the sphere of the subject to that of another person or
hing by a mere change of the connective -a- to -i-, without the
idded use of prefix or suffix:
    2a*-la’*t!an I shall put it about my waist, but 2a%-la’*t/in I shall
         put it about his waist
  In the form of the third personal subject with third personal object
f the aorist, the imperative with third personal object, and the
nferential with third personal object, the -i- generally appears as a
uffixed -hi- (-‘i-), incapable of causing umlaut:
    malagana’nhi he told him 30.15, but malagini’¢n I told him (172.1)
       wa-tlomémhi he killed him with it                                § 64

   It must be confessed that it has not been found possible to finds;
simple rule that would enable one to tell whether an 1-verb does or
does not keep a final -Ai (-‘i). Certain verbs, even though without
instrumental signification, show an -i- (or -Ai-) in all forms with thin
personal object.             Such are:
      aorist ogey- give to (ogethi he gave it to him 156.20)
      aorist wett'-g- take away from (wét‘gi he took it from him, 16.13}
      aorist lagag- feed (laga’k‘i he gave him to eat 30.12; lak’i give
         him to eat! lak‘igana‘k we seem to have given him to eat)
and indirective verbs in -anan-. Irregularities of an unaccountable
character occur. Thus we have:
     he*ia he left him (cf. het-i'wi’én I left him); but imperative
           he*iwi'hi leave him! (not *-iwi‘, as we might expect)
   In many cases the loss or retention of the final -hi seems directlt
connected with syntactic considerations.                             A large class of verbs with
instrumental prefix (generally 7-) drop the final -Ai, presumabl
because the instrumentality is only indefinitely referred to (cf.}
35,1). Examples of such have been given above. Assoon, however,
as the instrument is explicitly referred to, as when an instrumental
noun is incorporated in or precedes the verb, the -Ai is restored.
Thus:
  1 The -i- of these verbs regularly disappears, not only here but in every form in which the normalce
necting vowel -a- fails to appear in other verbs: al-ai’*k' (inferential) RE SAW HIM (*al-rik/-k' like dimi'
KILLED HIM), homonymous with al-z7’&k* (imperative) SEE HIM!             (=*alzi’k/). As soon, however, as tt
verb becomes distinctly instrumental in force, the -- is a constant element: al-wa-zi’k     ik’ (inferential)
SAW IT WITH IT.                                                                                                 '

‘spite the lack of an instrumental prefix in the verb.            Explicit in-
rumentality, however, can hardly be the most fundamental func-
mm of the -hi. It seems that whenever a transitive verb that
imarily takes but one object is made to take a second (generally
strumental or indirective in character) the instrumental -i- (with
tained -hi) isemployed. Thus:
   ma’zla k!iwa he threw dust
1t:
      ma’zla ‘alkliwahi dust he-threw-it-at-him (perhaps best trans-
        lated as he-bethrew-him-with-dust) cf. 184.5
here the logically direct objeet is ma’zla, while the logically indirect,
‘rhaps grammatically direct, object is implied by the final -Ai and
e prefix al-. Similarly, in:
   k‘o'px bababa’t't wa%di’xda ashes he-clapped-them-over his-body
        (perhaps best rendered by: he-beclapped-his-body-with-ashes)
        182.9
e logically direct obiect is k‘o*px, the logically indirect object, his-
dy, seems to be implied by the -‘i.         This interpretation of the -hi
i being dependent upon the presence of two explicit objects is con-
med by the fact that most, if not all, simple verbs that regularly
 tain it (such as GIVE TO, SAY TO in non-aorist forms, BRING TO,
rbs in -anan-) logically demand two objects.

   There is a good deal to indicate that the comparatively limited
number of possible final consonant-clusters is not a primary condi-
tion, but has been brought about by the dropping of a number of
consonants that originally stood at the end.
  1. The most important case is the loss of every final -¢‘ that stood
after a voiceless spirant or aspirated surd.          Its former presence in
such words can be safely inferred, either from morphologically par-
allel forms, or from other forms of the same stem where the phonetic
conditions were such as to preserve the dental.           Thus gwidi‘k‘'” HE
THREW IT represents an older reduplicated *gwidi‘k't' (= gwid-i-gwd-),
as proven by the corresponding form for the first person, guidi’k‘ ""dan
I THREW IT and gwidi’/k‘dagwa HE THREW HIM (122.13).                 Similarly
all participles showing the bare verb stem are found to be phonet-
ically such as not to permit of a final -f’, and are therefore historic-
ally identical with the other participial forms that show the -t':
        sdk‘ shooting (= *sak‘t‘)
        doz gathering (= *dézt‘)
        ha-tiilk‘ following in path (= *t/ak‘t')
    sana‘p* fighting (= *sana‘p'‘t’)
Compare:                           :
        yana‘t’ going
        loho‘t‘ dead
        sebe‘t' roasting
        démt' having killed
        se’nsant’ whooping
        yv‘lt' copulating with
The combinations -k‘vt‘k‘ (-k‘¥t‘g-) and -k‘¥t'z-, however, seem to
lose, not the -t‘-, but the -k‘”-, whereupon -t‘k‘ (-t‘g-) remains, while
-t'z- regularly becomes -s- (see § 20, 2):
        he*“qwida't'k‘ (=*gwida‘k'“t'-k*, inferential of gwidik‘“d-) he lostit
        he“guida’t'ga® (=*guida’k‘¥t'-ga‘) I lost it
        xa      idv’sguide® (=*guidi'k'“t'-a-gui- or possibly *guidi’k't'-
           gui-) I drown myself
                                                                       § 18

consonants. The following examples have been found in the material
at disposal:
        lal she twined basket (= *lalw) ; cf. la*lwa’‘n I twine it (that -w
             really belongs       to the stem is shown by the forms la*wa'n
             I shall twine it; /éazi twine it for me!)
        klel basket bucket (= *klelw); cf. klelwi’* her bucket
        k‘al penis (=*k‘alw); cf. k‘alwi’t his penis.
        sgelélé (=*sgeleltw) he keeps shouting; cf. sgelewa‘t‘ you shout,
           sgelwa'lt‘e* I shall keep shouting
        alsgalk‘a* (=*sgalwk‘a‘) I turned my head to one side to look at
           hin; cf. alsgé*lwi’n I shall turn my head to look at him
        alsgelélxi (=*sgelélwzi) he keeps turning his head to one side to
           look at me; cf. alsgala*liwi’'n I keep turning my head to look
           at him, future alsgalwalui'n
This process, as further shown by cases like gat EaT IT! (=*gatw), is
really a special case of the simplification of double diphthongs (see
§ 11). Perhaps such “dissimilated’’ cases as lé*- and le*- (for liu-
and léu-), see § 7, really belong here.                                                                       ,
   Other consonants have doubtless dropped off under similar condi-
tions, but the internal evidence of such a phenomenon is not as
satisfactory as in the two cases listed. The loss of a final -n is probable
in such forms as thegwe’hak'” HE WORKS, cf. thegwe’ hak‘*na‘n 1 work,
and thegwe’hak‘*nana‘k‘                 we     work.        Certain       verb-forms         would be
satisfactorily explained as originally reduplicated like guidi‘k*”, if we
could suppose the loss of certain final consonants:
     gini'*k* he went somewheres (= ?*gin-1’-*k'n)
     gelgulu‘k‘” he desired it (= ?*-gul-u'-k‘“l)
In the case of these examples, however, such a loss of consonants
is entirely hypothetical.
               § 19. SIMPLIFICATION                OF    DOUBLE         CONSONANTS      Morphologically doubled consonants occur very frequently in Ta-
kelma, but phonetically such theoretic doublings are simplified into
single consonants;             i. e., k‘+g become k* or g, and correspondingly
for other consonants. If one of the consonants is a fortis, the simpli-
fied result will be a fortis or aspirated surd with preceding catch,
according to the phonetic circumstances of the case. If one of the
     1Many of the doubtful cases would perhaps be cleared up if material were available from the uppe
dialect, as it shows final clusters that would not be tolerated in the dialect treated in this paper; e. §-

 affection. Examples of consonant simplification are:
         mo’t'ek* my son-in-law (= mo’t'- + -dek‘)
     lak‘wék‘ he gave him to eat (= lag- + -k‘wék')
     dek liya’k'v* if it goes on (= dekliya’g- + -k‘t*)
     li‘gwa’n I shall fetch them home (= li‘g- + -gwan); cf. aorist
        ligigwa’én
     dithila’k !wemé'n I make him glad (= hila‘k‘” glad + kleme*n I
        make him)
 A good example of three k-sounds simplifying to one is:
     ginak‘wit if he comes (= ginag-k‘¥-k't®)
   The interrogative element di never unites with the -t‘ of a second
 person singular aorist, but each dental preserves its individuality, a
 light % being inserted to keep the two apart:
         zemela’t'tdi do you wish to eat? (= zemela‘t' + di)
   The operation of various phonetic processes of simplification often           —
 brings about a considerable number of homonymous forms. One
 example will serve for many. From the verb-stem sé%g- sHOOT are
 derived:
    1. Imperative sdk‘ shoot it!
    2. Potential sak‘ he can, might shoot it
    3. Participle sak‘ shooting (=*sdk‘t’)
    4. Inferential sak‘ so he shot it (= *sag-k')
    The corresponding forms of the stem yana- Go will bring home the
 fact that we are here really dealing with morphologically distinct
 formations:
    1. yana* go!
    2. yana’é he would have gone
    3. yana‘t’ going
    4. yana‘k‘ so he went
    Another simplification of consonant groups may be mentioned
 here. When standing immediately after a stop, an organic, etymo-
 logically significant fA loses its individuality as such and unites with a
 preceding media or aspirated tenuis to form an aspirated tenuis,
 with a preceding fortis to form an aspirated tenuis preceded by a
 glottal catch     (in the latter case the fortis, being a syllabic final,
 cannot preserve its original form).       Thus, for the k- series, g or k‘ +h
_ becomes k‘, k! (or *k‘) +h becomes ‘k‘; gw or k‘” +h becomes kw,
~ klw (or ‘k'”) +4 becomes ‘k'w. Under suitable conditions of accent
                                                                       § 19

The dentals, guttural stops, and sibilants all simplify with z into

the ordinary stops and of the s, but leaving a trace in the vicarious ‘.
   1. All k- sounds (k', g, k!, k‘w, gw, k!w) simply disappear before r
without leaving any trace of their former existence, except in so far
as k! and k!w remain as ‘; if x is followed by a vowel, the w of the
labialized k-sounds unites with z to form zw:

   2. tz always simplifies to s, t/x to ‘s.        Whether the combination tz
really spontaneously developed into s it is naturally impossible to
say; all that can safely be stated is that, where we should by mor-
phologic analogy expect t+2, this combination as such never appears,
but is replaced by s. Examples are numerous:
        lebe’saf she sews (=lebe’t-za‘); cf., for -t° of stem, lebe‘t' she
           sewed it, for suffix -xa‘, lobo’xa* she pounds
        sgelewa'lsi he shouts to me (=sgelewa'ld-zi) ; cf. sgelewa'lda‘n I

          hansgs’t!an I shall cut it across
This change of éz to s is brought about constantly in the course of
word-formation, and will be incidentally exemplified more than once
in the morphology.
   3. sx simplifies to s, ts!x (=*sz) to °s.        Examples are:
        yimi’s‘aé he dreams ( =yimi's*-xa‘, with suffix -za‘ as in lobo’xa®
           above
        ha-uhana’‘s it stopped (raining)      (=*-hana’‘sz, stem hanats!-+
          -2)                   § 21. DISSIMILATION        OF    2 TO/ AND    m  If a (generally) final n of a stem is immediately followed, or, less
commonly, preceded by, a suffix containing a nasal, it dissimilates
tol.       The following examples have been found:
       » yalalana‘t’ you lost it (cf. yalnanada’* you will lose it, with n
           preserved because it forms a consonant-cluster with 7)
        ha-gwa‘l-a‘m in the road (cf. gwan road)
        Didala‘m Grant’s Pass (probably =over[di-] the rocks [da‘n])
        2atla‘mt'k‘ my urine; xala’xamt'e® I urinate (cf. xan urine)
        ba-isin-ai/lik!witn I blow my nose, with J due to -n of prefix
          s°in- nose (cf. ztn mucus)
     s‘inp'vl's flat-nosed, alongside of s*inp‘i’/n's
  The possibility of a doublet in the last example shows that the
prefix s‘in- is not as thoroughly amalgamated with the rest of the
word as are the suffixes; probably, also, the analogy of forms in -p‘in‘s
with other prefixes not containing an n would tend to restore an
anomalous-sounding s‘inp‘e’l‘s to -p‘i’n's.
                                                                           § 21

seems to have prevented the dissimilation of the -an to -al.
  It is practically certain that the -am of hagwa*la‘m, Didala‘m, and
2a°la‘mt'k' is at bottom phonetically as well as functionally identical
with the suffix -an (-al), seen in 2@%-gulma‘n (gulu‘m oak) and dak'-
s'6""ma'‘l, and rests on a second dissimilation of the nasal lingual (n)
of the suffix to a labial nasal                   (m), because            of the lingual            (2) of the
stem.   The history of a word like hagwG@4la‘m is in that event as
follows: An original *hagwG¢na‘n IN THE ROAD (stem gwdn- + nominal
characteristic -an) becomes first *hagwa@la‘n by the dissimilation of
the first n because of the following n, then hagwa*la‘m by the dissimi
lation of this second n because of the preceding 7. Similarly Didala‘m
and za*la‘mt'k* would go back to *Didana‘n and *zé°na‘nt‘k* respec-
tively; with the second form compare the reduplicated verb zala’xam-
(=*zanazan-) URINATE. The probability of such a dissimilation of
n to m is greatly strengthened by the fact that nearly all nouns with
an evidently suffixal noun-forming element -(a)m have an J in the
stem as compared to an -(a)n of nouns not so affected.                                       Contrast:

well-defined, if less numerous, group of noun-stems is found in which
the repeated long vowel bears a falling accent. Examples are:

Compare also t/oné’%s"" below (Type 3); ts-/ili’k!- and t‘bele’€s (Type
3) owe their falling accent to the presence of a glottal catch.
  Very remarkable is the stem formation of the noun ¢/iixi’t DRIFT
woop 75.5. It is evidently formed from the verb-stem dd%z- (aorist
stem tloxox-) GATHER (Woop) according to aorists of Type 7b, at the
same time with vowel ablaut (cf. theoretic t/ixi-xi HE GATHERS ME)
and falling accent, perhaps to give passive signification (see § 86, 1);
its etymologic meaning would then be THAT WHICH IS GATHERED.
No other noun of similar stem formation has been found.
      1If this etymology of ’up' is correct, Pit River 6p' TOBACCO must be borrowed from Takelma.

  4. Analogous to aorist stems of Type 4 verbs (e. g., yewei-) are a
ew nouns with repeated vowel and following ~- to form a diphthong.
)f such nouns have been found:

         138.17
  That the final -i- of these nouns is not an added characteristic,
out an integral part of the noun-stem, is proven by the facts that no
*xamples have been found of vowels followed by noun-characteristic
i- (ordinarily -n- or -m- is employed), and that ¢s:/elei- has been
found incorporated in that form.                           .

  6. Reduplicated nouns are not frequent in Takelma, particularly
when one considers the great importance of reduplication as a gram-
matical device in the verb. Examples corresponding in form to Type
12 aorists (i. e., with -a- [umlauted to -2-] in second member) are:
    tgwi'nt'gwin-i- shoulder (also      ts: le’k‘ts' lig-i- backbone 112.4;

Also wa-iwi’! erRL 55.7; 96.23 doubtless belongs here; the -wi’* of the
second syllable represents a theoretic -wi’y, umlauted from -wa’y, the
falling accent being due to the inorganic character of the repeated a.
A very few nouns repeat only the first consonant and add a, leaving
the final consonant unreduplicated.     Such are:
      ba’k‘ba* red-headed woodpecker (onomatopoetic) 92.2, 6
      ha’*k‘a* (=*hak!-ha*) goose 102.10; 106.2, 5
      bot'ba? orphan 122.1, 5
   A few nouns, chiefly names of animals, show complete duplication
of the radical element without change of the stem-vowel to -a- in the
second member.      This type of reduplication is practically entirely
absent in the verb. Examples are:
       ts: !e’*ts""!e& small bird (sp. ?)                      al-klok!lo‘k‘       (adj.)     ugly-faced
                                                                  60.5
        dalda‘l dragon-fly 21.1; 28.6                         bobo‘p* screech-owl 194.1
        p'aba’*p* manzanita-flour                             t‘ga’nt'gan fly (upper dialect)
    Even all of these are not certain.                        Those with radical -a- might
just as well have                   been classified with the preceding                     group      (thus
  1That +s” is felt to be equivalent to -s‘/ is shown by Bluejay’s song: ts /a’its* /-4 gwa’tca gwatca 104.7.
  4 bel-is felt as the base of this word, cf. Swan’s song beleld6+ wa’inha 104.15, which shows reduplication
of bel- like aorist helel- of hel- sina.

(p‘ab-ab-       like       plab-ab-    cHop).       This   latter   type   of reduplica-
sion seems, however,             to be as good as absent in the noun (but cf.
sgqwogwo'k'” ROBIN; mele‘lz BURNT-DOWN FIELD 92.27 may be morpho-
ogically verbal, as shown                by its probably       non-agentive -z).     The
*ullest type of reduplication, that found exemplified in the aorists
of Type 13 verbs, has not been met with in a single noun.

                             § 87. DERIVATIVE          SUFFIXES
   The number of derivative suffixes found in the noun, excluding
those more or less freely employed to form nominal derivatives from
the verb-stem, are remarkably few in number, and, for the most part,
limited in their range of application.      This paucity of live word-
forming suffixes is, of course, due to a great extent, to the large num-
ber of nominal stems in the language.       The necessity of using such
suffixes is thus greatlyreduced. The various derivational affixes found
in the Takelma noun will be listed below with illustrative examples.
   1. t‘(a)-.      This is the only derivational prefix, excluding of course
such considerably individualized elements as the body-part prefixes
of the verb, found in Takelma.    It is employed to form the words
for the female relationships corresponding to ELDER BROTHER and
YOUNGER BROTHER.
        waza his younger brother 54.1,5                t‘awdGza his younger sister 55.2
    wi-‘obt my elder brother 46.10     —-wi-t‘obt my elder sister (55.14)
  2. -ld’p‘a(kl-). This suffixt is found only in a number of nouns
denoting ranks or conditions of persons; hence it is not improbable
that it was originally a separate word meaning something like Per-
80N, PEOPLE.     That it is itself a stem, not a mere suffix, is shown by
its ability to undergo ablaut (for-1é’p‘i- see § 77). -k/-is added to it
in forms with possessive or plural affix. For example, from t/i1a’p‘a
178.7 MALE, HUSBAND are formed ¢/ila’piklt'k’ My HUSBAND
(142.7) and ¢/i#la’p‘ak!an HUSBANDS, MEN (130.1, 7). The fact that
the stem preceding -la’p‘a appears also as a separate word or with
other elements indicates that words containing -l@’p‘a may be best
considered as compounds.

   3. -k‘.      A number of place-names with suffixed -k‘ have been found:
       La’mhik* Klamath river
       Sbink‘ Applegate creek (cf. sbtn beaver)
       Gwen-p'uik* village name 114.14 (cf. p‘u‘n rotten 140.21)

   4, -a’*(n).         Nouns       denoting PERSON COMING FROM are formed by
adding this suffix to the place-name, with loss of derivative -k.
Examples are:

       Lamhi‘ya’* person from La’mhik‘, Klamath river
       Sbdi‘na’® person from Sbink*, Applegate creek

       Dak'-ts!a°mala’é
  1The -u'- of this word is doubtless merely the pitch-accentual peak of the -I-, the -- resonance of th
liquid being due to the preceding -o-. The word is thus to be more correctly written as Somolk' (similarly,
wulz ENEMY was often heard as wulu‘z), as implied by Somola’t ONE FROM SOMOLK'.               In that even!
somol-is very probably a frequentative in v+J (see § 43, 6) from sof MOUNTAIN, and the place-nam
means VERY MOUNTAINOUS REGION.

        Indian)

 Judging from the material at hand, it seems that -a’‘n is used only
hen the place-name ends in -m, though the ease with which -a’én
‘ay be heard as -a’* (see first footnote § 60) detracts from the cer-
inty of this generalization.
 5. -gw-.    This element occurs as a suffix in a number of terms
lating to parts of the body.         Examples are:
      tliba‘k‘* pancreas 47.17; tlibagw-a‘n-t'k* my pancreas (47.5, 6, 7,
         13) (incorporated t/iba- 46.1, 9)

      ma’ plagw-a-t'k* my shoulder-blade
 6. -(@)n- (or -m-, ==).          There are so many nouns which in their
bsolute form end in -(a)n or its phonetic derivatives -(a)m- and -(a) I-
see § 21) that there is absolutely no doubt of its suffixal character,
espite the impossibility of ascribing to it any definite functional value
nd the small number of cases in which the stem occurs without it.
‘he examples that most clearly indicate its non-radical character will
e conveniently listed here:
      he‘la‘m board 176.5 (cf. di‘-he’liya sleeping on board platform 13.2)
      is*Jela‘m hail 152.12, 16 (cf. verb-stem ts°/el- rattle)

                                                                    § 87

 sary part of the absolute form of the word, while the latter appeai
 only with grammatical increments.                          Thus the -am of he‘la‘m Bosak

listed above (§ 86, 2) as showing a repeated vowel (e. g., ya’p/a) reall
belong here.                 .

 of -lpz makes the existence of the latter of these almost certain (7 and
 n are throughout parallel in treatment); the former (because of the
  double labial; cf. the absence of -mp‘) is much less probable, despite
  the analogy of -Ik‘” and -nk‘¥. It is possible also that -lsk‘, ~msk’,
  and -nsk* exist, though their occurrence can hardly be frequent. Of
  final clusters of four consonants -nt'p‘k‘ has been found in s‘a’s‘ant'p‘k
  HE STOOD, but there can be small doubt that the -¢- is merely a dental
. tenuis glide inserted in passing from the dental nasal to the labial
  tenuis; compare the morphologically analogous form se’nsanp‘k' HE
  WHOOPED. However, the combinations -lpzk‘ and -npzk‘ (if -npz
  exists), though not found in the available material, very probably
  ought to be listed, as they would naturally be the terminations of
  morphologically necessary forms (cf. des‘tprk‘). Most, if not all, of

Boas]             HANDBOOK         OF   INDIAN   LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                  39 the preceding final combinations may furthermore be complicated by
 the addition of ‘, which is inserted before the first tenuis or voiceless
 spirant of the group, i. e., after a possible liquid or nasal:
      a *g'k* he laughed
      k‘o'*px dust, ashes.
        ts*/u’n®s (deerskin) cap
  As compared to the initial combinations, the table of final clusters
seems to present a larger number of possibilities. It is significant,
however, that only those that consist of 1, m, or n + single consonant
can ever be looked upon as integral portions of the stem (such as
za‘mk* and t'gwelk‘”); while those that end in -s can always be sus-
pected of containing either the verbal suffix -s (=¢+<2), or the noun
and adjective forming element -s. All other combinations are the
result of the addition of one or more grammatical elements to the
stem (e. g., su/*alp‘k' =s-u‘al-+-p‘+k'). Further investigation shows
that only two of the combinations, -t‘p‘ (second personal plural sub-
ject aorist) and -¢‘k* (first personal singular possessive) are suffixal
 units; though -t'p‘ might be ultimately analyzed into -¢' (second per-
 sonal singular subject aorist) + -p‘.               It is interesting to note that
 these clusters are at the same time the only ones, except ¢‘gw-, allowed
 initially, ¢‘b- and ¢‘g-.         The constitution of the Takelma word-stem
 may thus be formulated as
        tenuis (or voiceless spirant)            + media   (or voiced continuant)    +
          vowel     (or    diphthong)       + liquid or nasal     + stop   (fortis or
          media—tenuis), .
 any or all of the members of which skeleton may be absent except
 the vowel; f may           also be found before the vowel.
                          _ §17.    MEDIAL       COMBINATIONS   A medial combination consists simply of a syllabically final com-
. bination or single consonant + an initial combination or single con-
  sonant, so that theoretically a very large number of such medial
  combinations may occur. Quite a large number do indeed occur,
 yet there is no morphologic opportunity for many of them, such as
 k‘-l, np‘-m, and numerous others.                Examples of medial combinations
 are:
        tlomoma’n-ma‘ when he was killed
        helk‘-naé when he sang
        dak'-t‘gi’“ba‘n I put hollowed object (like hat) on top (as on head)
                                                                              § 17

interpreted as a contradiction of the non-occurrence of the same clus-
ters initially or finally, as they are not, syllabically speaking, clusters
at all. Had such combinations as, say, -¢‘gn- (in which -¢* would be
the final of one syllable and gn- the initial of the next) occurred, we
should be justified in speaking of an inconsistency in the treatment
of clusters; but the significant thing is, that such clusters are never
found. A Takelma word can thus ordinarily be cut up into a definite
number of syllables:
       gatk*na® when he ate it (=gatk'-na‘)
       yo'k‘yan I shall know it (= yo’k'-yan)
but these syllables have only a phonetic, not necessarily a morpho-
logic value (e. g., the morphologic division of the preceding forms is
respectively gat-k‘-na‘ and yok‘y-an).                          The theory of syllabification
implied by the phonetic structure of a Takelma word is therefore at
complete variance with that found in the neighboring Athapascan
dialects, in which the well-defined syllable has at least a relative
morphologic value, the stem normally consisting of a distinct syllable
in itself.
     One important phonetic adjustment touching the medial combina-
tion of consonants should be noted. If the first syllable ends in a
voiceless spirant or aspirated surd, the following syllable, as far as
initial stops are concerned, will begin with a media (instead of aspi--
rated surd) or aspirated surd + media; i.e., for a cluster of stops in
medial position, the last can be a media only, while the others are
aspirated surds. As also in the case of single consonants, this adjust-
ment often brings about a variation in the manner of articulation
of the final consonant in the cluster, according to whether its position
in the word is medial or final. Thus we have:
      xép‘ga‘ I did it; z@p‘k* he did it
Contrast, with constant -k'-:
       alxi’*k‘a‘ I saw it; alzi’/*k“ he saw it
the -g- of the first form and the -k‘ of the second being the same mor-
phological element; the -p‘ of both forms is the syllabically final }
of the stem ze‘b- Do, so that zép‘ga* stands for a theoretical *zébk‘a*‘,
a phonetically impossible form.     Other examples are:
   1 This form is distinct from alzi’k' LOOK AT IT!, quoted before.   The imperative theoretically= *alzt’/k/
the text form = *alzi’k/k'.","[43, 44, 45, 46]"

becoming a fortis; such as do not, introduce a catch before the second
consonant in non-aorist forms.     There seem to be no primarily in-
transitive verbs of this type. Examples of the type are:

  V-gi'na take it! (102.14)                      7-gina he took it 15.1; 45.13
  Despite the change of the second consonant from fortis to non-
fortis, it is not certain that it is always an integral part of the stem;
in de-bii’*gitn the g (k/) seems to be a verbifying suffix (cf. de-bii’e
FULL as adjective).           The accent of the base of verbs of Type 6 differs
materially from that of verbs of types heretofore discussed. The
normal pitch-accent of most verb-bases is the rising tone for long,
the raised for final short, vowels, unless a catch immediately follows.
Thus in Type 5 dak‘-da-hal HE ANSWERED                        HIM; Type 2 naga‘ HE
34ID TO HIM; but with catch Type 4 naga’** ne sam.       The verbs,
however, of Type 6, as will have been noticed, all have the falling
accent in both aorist and non-aorist forms. This variation from the
accentual norm becomes intelligible if we remember that a fortis
is the equivalent of a catch+a media; e. g., alzi/klin 1 SHALL SEE
am; alzi’*k‘ sex umm! As the catch tends to bring about a falling
accent before it, the falling accent peculiar to verbs of Type 6 may
plausibly be ascribed to the fortis (i. e., glottal catch) quality of the
final consonant           of the stem.        Compare   also, in Type     3, heiklin
                                                                               § 40
106                 BUREAU   OF AMERICAN        ETHNOLOGY                     feo.4I SHALL LEAVE IT OVER.        The retention of the falling accent in the
aorist, although the presumable cause of it has been removed, is an
example of form-parallelism, and argues, at least in verbs of this
type, for the secondary origin of the aorist stem.                The relation
between 20’t/an and 2d’*da‘n is, then, the same as that which obtains
between yowo’* HE Was and yowd’*dat WHEN HE WAS 79.7.
   The organic character of the fortis consonant of verbs of this type
is still further evidenced by many derivative forms (iteratives, con-
tinuatives, -xa- forms used to imply lack of object) which are reg-
ularly derived from the verb-stem, not the aorist stem, even in their
aorist forms.    Thus from sgd’“t!- 45.10 (aorist sgo’“d- 72.10) cur are
derived the derivative aorists sgot/o’sgade® 1 CUT FREQUENTATIVELY
(62.1), sgot/dl-ha'n I KEEP CUTTING IT (108.8), sgiit/ii’xade® 1 cuT (with-
out object) (92.2). Parallel forms are derived from most other verbs
of this type, such as ai’‘k!-, 16’“k!-, sgi’*p!- cur, sge’¢t!- LirtT up. Afew
verbs of Type 6, however, form the aorists of these derivatives from
the aorist stems of the simple verbs.          Such forms are the frequenta-
tives t‘baga’t‘bag- 14.12 (from ¢t‘ba’*k/- 136.20) and sege’sag- 172.10
(from se’¢k!- NOD TO, OPEN DOOR 138.18).
   Typr 7. Verb-stem c+v""+<¢,; aorist c!-+v+ce,+v(+%).      The second
sub-group (76) of this sparsely represented type of verbs is apparently
related to the first (7a) as are verbs of Type 4a to those of Type 2.
It is very improbable, however, that the characteristic -i- element
of the aorist is morphologically the same in both Type 4 and Type 7},
as verbs of the latter type are clearly transitive, while in Type 4 the
-i- was found to be a clearly intransitivizing element.                    A further
difference between the two types lies in the marked length of the
repeated vowel in verbs of Type 7b. This vocalic length is perhaps
responsible for the loss of the -i- in certain forms; e. g., di-t/igii
HE WORE    It, but di-t/iga'n 1 woRE     IT.     (See § 65.)
   Of Type 7a only the following examples have been found:
                Verb-stem                                Aorist stem
   ba?-dép‘de* I shall arise 196.3         ba2-t lebe’t‘e® I arose 186.14
  wa-dilnhin I shall distribute           wa-tiilik‘*nién I have distributed
     them                                    them (130.4)         .
   dwe‘p‘dwa’ prda* they will fly       _— t!wepl!e’ t!wapz they flew with
      without lighting                         out lighting            ‘
The last example follows also Types 6 and 13a.

  The last three verbs happen to have stems beginning with a conso-
nant or consonant-combination that doesnot allow of development into
a fortis, so that there is no initial modification in the aorist. A few
other transitive verbs have aorist stems like those of type 76, but
form their non-aorist forms according to other models, as the aorists
klemét- MAKE (only with third personal object; otherwise kleme©-n-,
corresponding verb-stem k/em-n- of Type 2) and yehéi- HEAR SINGING
FAR AWAY (verb-stem yehi‘-). In both aorist and non-aorist forms
the stem vowel or long 7-diphthong, when stressed, bears the rising or
raised accent (k/a@i‘ pick THEM! 6G%-t/ebe‘t’ HE AROSE).
  Type 8. Verb-stem c+v’+¢,; aorist c/+v+c,t+v+e,         The aorist

               (16.6)                                               (16.9)
            li'ma’*t‘ tree will fall (108.12)                   limi’‘m tree fell (108.11)
           hélt‘ee I shall sing (106.15)      helelt‘e® I sang (104.2, 5, 6)
        In the transitive verbs of this type the repeated consonant of the
     aorist is found only when the object is of the third person; otherwise
     it is dropped, with lengthening of the preceding vowel.                                   Thus:
            tlomo7t he killed him 16.15; but¢/omadxbi‘n he killed you(cf. 178.12)
     Before certain intransitivizing derivative suffixes, particularly -z-
     (see §56) and -aa- (see §53), the same loss of the repeated consonant
     of the aorist stem is to be noted. Thus:
            plaba‘p‘ he chopped it 90.11; but p/ebe’xa* he chopped 55.6
            wa‘-i-tlemem he gathered them together;                           but dak‘-t!eméx they
              are gathered together 43.9; 136.11
     With     -x- the preceding vowel                 is lengthened, with -xa- it remains
     short.      The second consonant of the stems of verbs of Type 8 never
     involves a radical glottal catch, hence the falling accent is never
     found on either the first or second stem vowel.
       Typr 9. Verb-stem c+v’+¢,; aoristc/-+v+y+vt+e,        This types
     not at all a common one. It differs from Type 7a in that the added
     vowel (in every case a, as far as the material goes) is put before the
     last consonant of the base, the y serving perhaps merely to connect
     the stem -a- and added -a-.
        Of Type 9, examples are:

""1      This verb might be considered as entirely parallel to gday- (aorist klayai-) of Type8. The derive
     tive in -Id-, however, seems to prove it to be of Type 9; the -Id- forms, if belonging to Type 8, would
     probably appear as *da-disya Idin, *da-tlayaya Idin.

This type embraces the few verbs that form their aorist stem by
merely repeating the initial consonant of the verb-stem. Of 10a,
that is, those that introduce the initial consonant immediately after
the stem-vowel, there have been found:
                        Verb-stem                                            Aorist stem

   The last verb differs from the others in that it repeats in the aorist
both the consonant and the vowel of the verb-stem; it is the only
verb known which shows perfect duplication of the verb-stem (as-
suming the suffixed character of the -k/-).1_                      Perhaps -lek/-is misheard
for -lelk!-.
   The only certain example of 106                     is:
                      Verb-stem                                              Aorist stem
        sana* spear it! (33.9)                .              sans he speared it (110.20)
The verb-stem            here is of Type 5.               The    simple      base (san-) is best
seen in the fully reduplicated sd*nsa’n-sinia“ THEY ARE FIGHTING
EACH OTHER 23.14. An aorist of Type 106 is probably also:
                                                       ha-u-gwen-yutli’hi (=*yut!y-[h}t)
                                                         he gobbled it down (cf. fre-
                                                          quentative yut!uwyad-)
 See also aorist yd“mi‘- under Type 5.                       Stems of this type are more
 frequent among nouns than verbs, e. g., belp' swan (see § 86, 5).
   Type 11. Verb-stem c+v+c,+c; aorist ctv+ce,tuv+c.           Verbs
 belonging to this type differ in the aorist from those of the preceding
 type in that they introduce before the repeated initial consonant also
 the vowel of the stem, thus approaching in form the more fully
 teduplicating Type 13. Only a few examples of the type occur:
    .                    Verb-stem                                  Aorist stem

        xalxa’mt‘e® I shall urinate (cf.                     xala/xamt‘e® I urinated *
           2a@%l-am- urine)
   ! There are many apparently perfect duplications of verb-stems in -a-, but the -a- of the second member
 is never a repetition of the stem-vowel. See Type 12.
    *This verb is better considered as belonging to Type 13a, zalzam- and xalavam- being respectively
 dissimilated from * zanzan- and *zanazan- (see §21).                                      § 40

   It is quite possible that many verbs whose verb-stem ends in a con-
sonant identical with their initial consonant (and that one would be
inclined to list under Type 2) really belong to Type 11. In such
cases as:
      ging- go somewhere (aorist ginig-)
      kliy[alg- go, come (aorist k/iyig-)
      gel-gul[a]g- desire (aorist- gulug-)
it is not easy to decide whether the final -g- is a suffixed element, as
in many verbs of Type 2, or a repetition of the initial consonant of
the base. As to the genesis of the form in verbs of Type 11, it seems
clear that it is only a secondary development of the far more richly
represented Type 13. This is indicated by the existence of second
forms of Type 13 alongside those of Type 11:
      da-bok!oba’k‘na‘nI make bubbles                  yiwiya’ut'e® I talk (148.9)
      mo'lo'mala'n I turn things over
         (170.16)
A form      like    mo‘’lo‘mat' rou TURNED THINGS OVER                 may go back to
a *mo'lo‘mlat' (Type 130), itself a reduced form of the fully redu-
plicating mo’lo‘malat‘; but see § 65.
   Type 12. Verb-stem c+v’+c,; aorist c+v’t+e,tce+a+e,. Verbsof
this type form their aorist by reduplicating the verb-stem according
to Type 2 (see § 30); the a of the second syllable of the aorist stem
is regularly umlauted to 7 by ani of the following syllable (see § 8,
3a). Morphologically such aorist stems are practically identical
with the verb-stems of Type 13a, though no further deductions can
be drawn from this fact. Contrary to what one might expect, most
verbs of the type show no marked iterative or frequentative signifi-

   There is a tendency to prevent a long u-diphthong of the first
syllable of the aorist stem from standing immediately before a
diphthong-forming semivowel or consonant (y, w, 1, m, n) of the
second syllable.    In such cases the w is either lost, as in the last
example above (dissimilation is also a possible explanation) or a con-
necting -i- is introduced between the u, which now becomes w, and
the following consonant.    Examples are:
                        Verb-stem                               .                Aorist stem
   léazink* he will call me by name                         _le®wila’usi ? he calls me by name
                                                                59.7
  liti¢‘ee I shall look (142.18)  °     liwila’ut‘e®* I look (59.14)
The stem vowel of verbs of Type 12 is regularly long, and, when
stressed, as it generally is in aorist forms, receives the rising accent.
The a of the second syllable of the aorist stem is stressed only when
forming a secondary diphthong with a following repeated radical
element, in which case it receives a falling (Ja*la’uhi HE CALLED HIM)
or raised accent (he-sal-t‘gi""nt'ga‘n).
  1 The various forms of this verb seem to be made up of three distinct stems.     Thenon-aorist forms of both
 transitive and intransitive (sana’p'deeI SHALL FIGHT) employ astem (sana-) of Type.      Most aorist forms,
 including the reciprocal aorist, use the stem sdansan- of Type 12 (seensa’nsi HE FIGHTS ME; sd@nsa’nsinik’
 WE FIGHT EACH OTHER).       The stem sdans- of Type 10b is probably limited to such transitive forms of the
 aorist as have a third person object (sdensa’'n I FIGHT HIM; sins HE FOUGHT HIM).
  ? Parallel form, perhaps with iterative significance, to leela’usi, § 7.
  ‘This verb has a short ¢ in the first syllable of the aorist, so that, as far as the aorist stem is concerned,
 it seems to belong to Type 18a.    Perhaps it is best considered a verb of mixed type (13a in aorist, 12 in
 Don-gorist).

Boas]          HANDBOOK          OF INDIAN    LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                113The verb-stem of the last example seems at first sight identical with
the aorist stem, but the second 7 is to be explained as a connective
element similar to the 2 of le‘wilau- above (see under Type 12);
yiwiyawa’'s is thus developed from a theoretical *yiwyawa’és.
   The verb k‘a'p‘k‘ab- above illustrates a slightly divergent subtype
of Type 13a. If the final consonant of the stem is a fortis, it appears
as a non-fortis (voiceless media or aspirated surd according to the
phonetic circumstances) when repeated.     This phenomenon is best
explained as an example of catch dissimilation; *k‘aplak‘apl-, i. e.,
k‘a‘b'ak‘a‘b’- is dissimilated to k‘a‘b‘ak‘ab-, k‘aplak‘ab- (see § 22).
In non-aorist forms, where the fortis becomes a syllabic final, it
naturally gives way to the equivalent catch aspirated surd. Further
examples of this subtype are:
                     Verb-stem                                Aorist stem        7-sg6’*t‘sgidin I shall cut them         i-sgot!o’sgidi'n I cut them one

          gobble them all down                      bled them all down (126.10)

          them through (21.2)                       through (22.9; 138.7)

          your anus! 164,19; 166.1,6               out my anus (166.8)
   In regard to vocalic quantity it will be noticed that both the stem
vowel and the repeated vowel are generally short. Comparatively
few cases are found with long stem-vowel in non-aorist forms (he‘-
gwagw-, swi'lswal-, sgo“*t'sgad-). Indeed the shortness of the vowel
of the verb-stem is about the only mark of difference between verb-
stems of Type 13 and aorist stems of Type 12. Thus:
        i-s'wi'ls‘wal (non-aorist of Type 13) tear it to pieces! ; but 7-s-wil-
       s‘wa'l (aorist of Type 12) he tore it (with one tear)
A few verbs allow the repeated vowel, particularly in third personal
forms, to be long; when stressed, as it generally is, it has a falling
accent. Besides ts‘ /ini'ts-lanz- (also ts*!i’nits:lana- or ts*!i’ nits lana-
190.19), may be mentioned:
     gwen-hegwe'‘hagwanhi he related it to him 57.9; cf. 59.6
        plilii’*p!lalht they marched in single file 192.3
In non-aorist forms the vowel, if long and stressed, takes the ris-
ing accent; before a glottal catch, however, we regularly have the
         3045°—Bull. 40, pt 2-128                                           § 40
114                   BUREAU        OF    AMERICAN    ETHNOLOGY                    (BULL.40falling accent (sg6’“t'sgad-, sgi’**p‘sgab-).           In the aorist the stress gen-
erally falls on the repeated vowel.
  Only two verbs have been found that at first sight conform to
Type 13 6. They are:
                    Verb-stem                                       Aorist stem.
  de'i-ge’'ukliwin I shall               tie (a   de*4-gewe’k!iwi'n I tied it bow-
     salmon) bowstring-fashion                      string-fashion (cf. 88.5)
  di'lt!ilin I shall stuff them intoit             dili’tiilin I stuffed them into
                                                     it (122.19;      138.17)
This curious type of verb is easily explained if we assume that
the bases are not gew- and diil-, respectively, but geu‘- and diil*-.
They are, then, strictly comparable to verbs like sgot!/osgad- dis-
cussed above; instead of having a fortis consonant, i. e., a stop with
glottal closure, as the final consonant of the base, they have a semi-
vowel or diphthong-forming consonant (w, y, J, m,n) as the base final.
The verb and aorist stems of geu‘- and diil‘-, formed according to Type
134, are theoretically *gew'gau‘-, *gewe'gau‘- and *diil‘dal*-, *diilii‘dal:.,
respectively.      Allowing, as in the case of the forms like k‘ap!/ak‘ab-
discussed above, for catch dissimilation, these forms are seen to be
phonetically equivalent to geuklau-, geweklau- and diiltlal-, diiliitlal-,
respectively (see § 12).            If the initial consonant of the verb happens
not to be a media, then there is no opportunity for the development
of a fortis in the second syllable of the verb-stem. It is clear, then,
that the following verbs are further examples of Type 13 b:
                  Verb-stem                                        Aorist stem

    things over                                     things over

    shake shells in my ears                          shells in my ears 122.2
  ha-u-gwen-yu'nfyinin I shall                    ha-u-gwen-yunu’yini‘n I gob
      gobble them down                               bled them down (cf. yut!uyad-
                                     above)
The stem syllable of verbs of Type 136, when bearing the stress,
naturally have the falling accent.
  Examples of Type 13 c are not common and have also by-forms of
Type 13 a:
                Verb-stem                                     Aorist stem  gwida’k‘*dan         I    shall   throw    it   gwidi’k‘*da‘n I threw it (122.13);

pas]           HANDBOOK     OF INDIAN    LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                        115 It is very probable that the -a- in the second member of redupli-
ated stems (Types 12 and 13) is the inorganic -a- we have already
ret with. Its persistence, even in cases where the otherwise resulting
honetic combination is a possible one, may be ascribed to the ana-
ygic influence of the probably larger number                 of cases     where    its
resence is phonetically necessary.
  Type 14. Verb-stem v+c; aorist v+c+v+n.                    The -n of the few
erbs that make up this class is probably a petrified derivative ele-
rent, yet it must be considered as characteristic of the aorist stem
1 an even more formal sense than, for example, the aoristic -2- of
‘ype 4. The only examples that have been found are:
                Verb-stem                               Aorist stem
 xép‘de* I shall do so (110.22)             xebeiit'e! I did so (14.10; 168.10)

 plé’t’ he will be lying down              pleyént‘e® I was lying down 71.5
       146.9
  The last verb seems to insert a -y- in the aorist, between the -e- of
he verb-stem and that of the aoristic addition, in the manner of
‘etbs of Type 96. In regard to vocalic quantity these verbs differ
mong themselves.      The verb-stem of all but wai- is long in vocalism.
the first vowel of the aorist stem is short in every case, the repeated
‘owel is sometimes short (xeben-, pliyin-), sometimes long (waya*n-)
weyen-. The stressed stem vowel bears a rising accent.
 The -n of wayaé*n- and p/eye’n- is eclipsed before a catch in the
hird person:
       waya’® he slept 152.22; 154.6
       pleye’®he was lying down 49.5
rut:
       zebe’*n he did it 78.9; 118.14
The loss of the -n takes place also in the third person aorist of ydn-
10 (Type 5). Thus: ~
       ya’ he went 15.3,11; 59.1; 92.26
ubordinate form ya’¢da‘ 58.8 and (rarely) ya’*ndaf WHEN HE WENT.

wanting in the non-aorist forms of many verbs, it has something ol
the appearance of such. The non-aoristic -as- of a few verbs has

purely formal element characterizing the non-aorist forms of the

which otherwise belongs to Type 2 or 3 (if the second -m- is part ol
the base).
   Type 16. Verb-stem v+c+ce,+12; aorist v+ctvt+e,       This typ
embraces only an inconsiderable number of verbs. They are:

   Several verbs of position that show an -7- in the aorist show an -+
in non-aorist forms. Whether this -i- is merely a shortened form ol
the aoristic -2'-, or identical with the non-aoristic -i- of verbs of Type
16, is doubtful; but, in view of the absence of the -%‘- in non-aoristic
forms of verbs of Type 15, the latter alternative seems more probable.
Such verbs are:

In speaking of verbs of Types 15 and 16, the terms verb-stem and
rist stem are used in a purely relative sense, the portions of the
ted forms printed in Roman characters not being really on a par

‘transitive -za- may be well brought out by a comparison with the
istinctly double signification of English intransitively used transi-
ves.     If such a transitive word as sPLit be relieved of its object, it
1ay be employed in two quite distinct senses, either to indicate the
ame sort of action that is expressed by the transitive, but without ex-
licit direction (as, THE CARPENTER CAN SPLIT, i. e., can split beams,
oards); or to indicate a spontaneous non-volitional activity resulting
1a static condition identical with that induced by the corresponding
Transitive action (as, THE BEAMS, BOARDS, SPLIT, i. e., spontaneously
                                                                    § 56

matic, not literally translatable usage. Such petrified suffixes :

As noun-characteristics are used four elements: -(a)n (including
n and -al), -a-, -i-, and -u-. Although each noun, in so far as it
s any noun-characteristic, is found, as a rule, to use only one of
ase elements, no rule can be given as to which of them is to be
pended to any given noun.                    Nouns in suffixed -(a)n, or -(a)m, for
ample,       are found      with characteristic            -i- (b&“bin-i- [from            bi*-ba‘n
M]), -a- (he‘lam-a- [from he‘la‘m Boarp]), -(a)n (gulm-an- [from
lam Oak]), and without characteristic (bo’k‘dan-z-dek‘ MY NECK
om bo’k‘dan 15.12, 15)).
1. -(a)n.         Examples of this characteristic erement are:
     gwit!i-n- wrist (cf. variant gwit!i-1-)
     thbagw-an- pancreas 45.15; 46.5 (absolute t/iba‘k'” 47.17)
     da*madagw-an- shoulder
     lek‘w-an- rectum
     da*-n-x- ear 14.4; 15.13 (incorporated da?-)
     ts/@°w-an- lake, deep water 59.16 (absolute ts/da 162.9; 166.15)
     gulm-an- oak (absolute gula‘m)
   bob-in- ' alder 94.17 (absolute bo‘p‘)
Its phonetic reflexes -al and -am occur in:
      s°6""m-al- mountain 124.2; 152.2 (absolute soft 43.6; 122.16)
      dé“m-al- testicles 130.8 (absolute d5""m 130.20)
      ts!a@¢m-al- (in Dak'‘-ts!a*mala’é Klamath Indian, parallel to
        Dak'-ts!é*wana’®)
      gwa*l-am- trail 48.6, 8; 96.8, 9 (absolute gwan 148.7)
      va%l-am- urine (absolute zén)
-am- is also found, though without apparent phonetic reason, in 2a@*-
m- BAOK (incorporated 2@*-). Certain nouns add -g- before taking
n- as their characteristic:
   waz-gan- creek (absolute wa‘z)
   del-gan-(z-) anus 45.9; 72.10; 94.15
   bil-gan-(2-) breast
   gel-gan- breast (cf. variant gel-x-)
2. -a=-.       More frequently occurring than -(a)n- is -a-, examples                               of
hich are:                       ;
   dana- rock (absolute da‘n 17.8; dal-am- as possible variant in
      place-name Di-dala‘m over the rocks [?])
      ey-a- canoe 112.6; 114.5, 13; 156.2 (cf. variant ei-2-)
      t‘gwan-a- slave (absolute ¢‘gwa‘n 13.12)
      he*lam-a- board 55.8, 10 (absolute hela‘m 176.5)

as to the form of the aorist stem, the various types of aorist forma-
tion being each exemplified by a heterogeneous array of verbs, as far
as any discernible similarity of meaning is concerned. It is true that,
in a comparatively few cases, certain types of aorist formation can
be shown to be characteristic of intransitive verbs; but in these the
formation of the aorist stem involves the addition of a distinct pho-
netic element that has every appearance of being a worn-down suffix.
   Not the least remarkable feature of tense-formation lies in the fact
that the most frequently used of the tense-modes, the aorist (equivalent
to immediate future, present, and past), generally shows the derived or
amplified form of the base; while the far less important tense-modes,
the future, inferential, potential, and present and future imperatives
employ the generally more fundamental verb-stem.          In its naked
form the aorist stem appears as the third person subject third per-
son object aorist transitive. For example:
      tlomém he killed him
      naga‘ he said to him
      -hal he answered him
     o’4t' he hunted for him
The bare verb-stem appears as the second person singular (third per-
son object) present imperative intransitive and transitive. For ex-
ample:
     dom kill him!
     odo* hunt for him!
      na‘ say! do!
and as the first element of the periphrastic future, that will later
receive treatment.
   In striking contrast to the extensive use in Athapascan of distinct
and unrelated stems for the singular and plural, only a very few such
cases have been discovered in Takelma; and even in these the singu-
lar stem may, it seems, also be used in the plural.","[99, 100]"

 fairly considerable number of words, as indicated particularly by
1e fact of its frequent occurrence after a consonant. Examples are:

lso some of the dissyllabic nouns in -s with repeated vowel listed
bove     (§ 86, 3) may belong to this set.
 A few other stray elements of a derivational aspect have been

"   As soon as the verb ceases to be transitive (or passive) in form
when the third personal object is the personal -k‘wa, the instrument
~- disappears:

instrumental -i-; contrast i-t/ana/hi HE HELD IT with 7-t/ana‘han
HE HELD HIM.       Any ordinary transitive verb may lose its obje
and take a new instrumental object, whereupon the instrumental
becomes necessary.      Examples of such instrumentalized transitiy
are:

If, however, it is desired to keep the old object as well as the n

It is not clear whether or not this -an- is related to either of the ~
elements of -anan- (§ 50).
   A final -‘i is kept phonetically distinct in that it does not un
with a preceding fortis, but allows the fortis to be treated as a syle!
final, i. e., to become ‘+ aspirated surd:
    he**-le’me'k‘the killed them off, but -le’mek i°n T killed them off
  Forms without connective vowel whose stem ends in a vowel, a
yet (as instrumentals or otherwise) require an -i-, simply insert t
element (under proper phonetic conditions as -hi-) before the mo
and personal suffixes:
     wa-woo'hin I shall go to get it with it (contrast woo’n I shall
        to get it)

is, in -i- verbs, colored to -i-:

A considerable number of transitive verbs whose aorist stem ends
a long diphthong with rising pitch (long vowel +semivowel, nasal,
' liquid) treat this diphthong as a vocalic unit, i. e., do not allow
.e second element of the diphthong to become semivocalic and thus
pable of being followed by a connective -a- before the personal
idings (cf. intransitive forms like et-t‘, § 60). If such a long diph-
.ong is final, or precedes a consonant (like -t') that is itself incapable
‘entering into diphthongal combination with a preceding vowel, no
fficulty arises. If, however, the long diphthong precedes an -n-
n such       endings as -'n, -n, -nak‘), which, as has been seen, is pho-
tically on a line with the semivowels y (7) and w (uw), a long double
phthong (long vowel + semivowel, nasal, or liquid +7 of time-value
  results. Such a diphthong can not be tolerated, but must be
duced to an ordinary long diphthong of time-value 3 by the loss of
ie second element (semivowel, nasal, or liquid) of the diphthong of
1e stem (see § 11).               Thus the coexistence of such apparently contra-
ctory forms as dé*-yehétt' YoU GO WHERE THERE IS SINGING and

some respects a remarkable parallel to the reduction of an Indo-Germanic longdiphthong to a simple
vowel before certain consonants, chiefly -m (e. g., Indo-Germanic *djéys = Skr. dydu’s, Gk. Zede, with
served -y- because followed by -s, a consonant not capable of entering into diphthongal combination:
Indo-Germanic ace. *djém= Ved. Skr. dyam, Hom. Gk. Ziv with lost -y- because followed by -m,a conse
capable of entering into diphthongal combination).      I do not wish to imply, however, that the acce

ceding vowel by the catch:
        ma/‘a‘ but you, you truly
        bo“a* nowadays indeed
If a diphthong in 7 or wu precedes a catch followed by a vowel, the 7 or
w often appears as y or w after the catch:
        k!waya* just grass (= k!wat+-a')
        G’*ya‘ just they (= ai- they +-a‘)
        ha‘wi- (= ha-u- under +7- with hand)
   If the second of two syntactically closely connected words begins
with a semivowel (w or y) and the first ends in a vowel, a catch is
generally heard to separate the two, in other words the semivowel is
treated as a vowel.         Examples are:
        ge’* wok’   (=ge' + wok‘) there he arrived
        be** wa2di’t (= be? + wadi') day its-body =all day long
        get ya’*hi (=ge+ya’*hr) just there indeed
Such cases are of course not to be confounded with examples like:
     me'wok' HE ARRIVED HERE, and
     me'yé, COME HERE!
in which the catch is organic, being an integral part of the adverb
me® HITHER;         contrast:
    megini'*k* HE CAME HERE, with
    ge ginw""*k* HE WENT THERE.
The same phonetic rule applies even more commonly when the first
element is a noun or verb prefix:
        ha‘wini’'da inside of him; but habe*bini‘ at noon
        de'wiliwia’“* they shouted; but dezebde’‘n he said so
        abai‘watyewenhi he returned inside with him; but abaigini’*k‘ he
           went inside
        wi'wa my younger brother; but wiha‘m my father
   It is interesting to note that the catch is generally found also
 when the first element ends in J, m, or n, these consonants, as has
 been already seen, being closely allied to the semivowels in phonetic
 treatment:                                                             ,

24                  BUREAU    OF AMERICAN     ETHNOLOGY            [Buue.40It goes without saying that the catch separates elements ending in
1, m, or n from such as begin with a vowel:
      s‘in‘ilatslagi’*n I touch his nose                           .
      alt‘ baga’t‘bak* he struck them                          § 7. DISSIMILATION     OF   u     A diphthong in wu tends, by an easily understood dissimilatory
process, to drop the u before a labial suffix (-gw-, -p‘, -ba*).       Thus
we have:
       wahawazi‘gwa’'n I rot with it, for *riugwa’*n
Compare:
       hawazi/“ he rots
       wahawazxiwigwa'n I shall rot with it
Similarly:
       biltk‘*” he jumped having it, for *hiliak‘» (stem biliw-)
       wiltk‘” he proceeded with it, for *wiliak'’ (stem wiliu-)
Observe that, while the diphthong iw is monophthongized, the orig-
inal quantity is kept, i being compensatively lengthened to 7‘. In the
various forms of the verb yéu- RETURN, such dissimilation, wherever
possible, regularly takes place:
     yek‘’ he returned with it, for *yéak'”(=yéa- gw- k*)
     mefyép’ come back! (pl.), but sing. me‘yéa
       yecba’: let us return! for *yéuba’*
It is interesting to note how this u- dissimilation is directly respon-
sible for a number of homonyms:
       yek‘» bite him!
       (al) yép‘ show it to him!
A similar dissimilation of an -u- after a Jong vowel has in all proba-
bility taken place in the reduplicating verb la*liwi’*n I CALL HIM BY
NAME (le‘a’ust HE CALLS ME BY NAME) from * lauliwi’'n (* léula’usi).","[28, 29, 30]"

  Type 3. Verb-stem v+cec+¢,; aorist      v+c!+u+e.       The most
satisfactory test of a verb of this type. is the intervocalic fortis
consonant         of the aorist stem              as contrasted with the correspond-
ing non-fortis consonant of the verb-stem.                            As only the minority of
base-final consonant-clusters begin with a consonant that is capable
of being changed to a fortis, there are in the material available only a
few verbs to which the test can be applied. Those showing an
intervocalic fortis (changed from non-fortis) in the aorist stem are:
                       Verb-stem                                                  Aorist stem

  In other verbs of this type the only characteristic of the aorist
stem is the repetition between the consonants of the cluster of the
stem-vowel. The following verb-forms exemplify this group, with
the reservation           that     if in any case the              second          consonant             of the
cluster be really a suffix, the form should be assigned to Type 2. .

_     As long as the first consonant of the cluster is a semivowel (u, 1
    or a liquid or nasal (J, m, n), the question as to whether the verb
    belongs to Type 2 or Type 3 is a purely etymological or historical one.
    Descriptively it. makes no difference whether a form like p’elega'n
    I WENT TO WAR AGAINST THEM is derived from p‘eleg- by the inser
    tion of the stem-vowel -e- between J and g (Type 3), or from p‘d--
    by the addition of the -e- to a base p‘el- (Type 2). From a purely
    descriptive point of view, then, the most typical aorist formation 1
    Takelma may be said to be characterized by the repetition of the sten-
    vowel immediately after the first consonant following the stem-vowel.
      From       the point of view of vocalic quantity the verbs of Type 3
    fall into the same two classes as those of Type 2—such                       as havea
    short vowel     in the stem (t/amy-, ts!awy-, malg-, p‘elg-, hants!-) and
    such as have a long vowel (iits'!-, gi‘lb-, k/a%ls), these latter being
    apparently much less numerous than in Type 2. The quantity of,
    both the stem vowels of the aorist is regularly short, even when the
    verb-stem vowel is long (gilib-, klalas-); only rarely is the second
    vowel of the aorist stem long (leye’s-, tiyiits'!-).               The .accent of
    stressed stem vowels follows the same rules as in the case of verbs of
    Type 3 (dowaitt'e®, han-gili‘p‘ with rising or raised pitch; but hana’s.
    he’*x-da* HE WILL BE LEFT OVER, tyii’“sde’ 1 LAUGH, with falling

ype are intransitive, the -7-, though confined to the aorist, being
vidently in some way connected with the intransitive character.

       t‘aga*na’‘n I make him cry
rhile in certain other transitive derivatives it is preserved:
       t‘agayagwa’'n I cry having it
the contradiction in treatment is here only apparent, as the absence
i presence of the -i- would seem to depend not so much on the
ransitive or intransitive form of the verb as on whether the action
ixpressed by the verb is logically transitive or not (in a causative the
tion is necessarily directed toward an object, in a comitative the
ormal object is not concerned in the action of the verb at all). Types
la and 4b may: properly be considered subclasses of Types 2 and 1
spectively, though it should be noted that the -i- occurs nowhere
xcept in one special tense—the aorist. Examples of Type 4a are:

   The aorist of verbs of Type 4 regularly have the rising accent on
the i- dipthong formed by the repeated stem vowel and the 7- suffix.
The stressed stem-vowel of forms built on the verb-stem regularly
has the rising (4a) or raised accent (second vowel of 4b). na-, which
is irregular also in othér respects, has a short vowel in the verb-stem
and takes the raised accent in non-aorist forms under appropriate
conditions (na‘t' saying; na‘ say it!).

   The two stem vowels of the verb-stem are always short in quantity,

the rising accent. To this latter rule there is one curious exception.
The verb odo- HUNT FoR always has the falling accent on the 0* of
the aorist (6’“t' HE HUNTED FOR IT 13.9; 88.8, never *6""Z'), but the non-
aorist forms follow in everything the analogy of other verbs of this
type. This anomaly is quite unexplained.       Can it be that a leveling
out of two originally distinct paradigms has taken place (*6“d- , odo'- of
Type 5 and d’d- , *0’*t!- of Type 6)?

rule, as in these cases the falling accent regularly goes with    the personal ending -n.   Practically all vio
lations of the accent rules found in the examples are of this merely apparent character and will be readily
explained away when the subject of personal endings is considered.","[107, 108, 109, 110]"

it will suffice to say that there are three distinct sorts of inorganic or
secondary a- vowels: the regular inorganic a first illustrated above,
inserted between two consonants that would theoretically form a
cluster; the post-consonantal constant a of certain stems (such as
wism- above) that would otherwise end in more or less impracticable
consonant clusters (this -a appears as ~i under circumstances to be
discussed below); and a connecting a employed to join consonantal
suffixes to preceding consonants (such suffixes are generally directly
added to preceding vowels or diphthongs).      The varying treatment
accorded these different secondary a@ vowels will become clearer in
the morphology.
             § 11.   SIMPLIFICATION        OF DOUBLE    DIPHTHONGS   By a double diphthong is meant a syllable consisting of an ordinary
diphthong (long or short) followed by a semivowel (y, w) or by 1, m,
or n. Such double diphthongs are, for instance, aiw, diw, auy, duy,
ain, Gin, alw, G*lw; those with initial short vowel, like ain, have,
like the long diphthongs (e. g. dn), a quantitative value of 3 morae,
while those with initial long vowel, like din, have a quantitative value
of 4 morae and may be termed over-long diphthongs.          Double diph-
thongs may theoretically arise when, for some reason or other, a con-
necting or inorganic a fails to lighten the heavy syllable by reducing
it to two (see particularly § 65 for a well-defined class of such cases).
Double diphthongs, however, are nearly always avoided in Takelma;
there is evidently a rhythmic feeling here brought into play, a dislike
of heavy syllables containing three qualitatively distinct sonantic
elements.
   In consequence of this, double diphthongs are regularly simplified
by the loss of either the second or third element of the diphthong;
in other words, they are quantitatively reduced by one mora (the
simple double diphthongs          now have     a value of 2 morae,     the over-
long     diphthongs     3 morae     like ordinary long      diphthongs),      while
qualitivetatly       they now    involve    only two   sonantic   elements.     An
exception seems to be afforded by double diphthongs in -wy (e. g.
-auy), which become dissyllabic by vocalizing the y to 7, in other
words, -awy becomes -awi:
      tslawi‘k‘ he ran fast; cf. ts/a-uya’'s fast runner, ts/awaya't'
          (aorist) you ran fast
        yawi't'e* I shall talk; cf. yawaya‘t' (aorist) you talked
                                                                           § 11
 30                       BUREAU       OF       AMERICAN        ETHNOLOGY                       (BULL.40The -awi- (=theoretic -awy-) of these forms is related to the -away-
of the aorist as the -ilw- of bilwa’*s suMPER to the -iliw- of the aorist
biliwa‘t’ you JUMPED.
   Such double diphthongs as end in -w (e. g. -aiw, -d%lw) simply
lose the -w:
        gat     eat it! (=*gatw); gatk’                  he    ate    it     (=*gatwk‘);       compare
              ga~iwa’n I shall eat it
Other examples of this loss of w are given in § 18, 2.                                        All other
double diphthongs are simplified by the loss of the second vowel (i, u)
or consonant (J, m, n); a glottal catch, if present after the second
vowel or consonant, is always preserved in the simplified form of the
double diphthong.             Examples of simplified double diphthongs with
initial short vowel are:
        gelhewe’hafn (=*-hau'n) I think; compare gelhewe’hau he thinks
        ami’ha'n (=*-ham‘n) I sent him; compare imi’ham he sent him

          maker and k/ema’n make it! (with inorganic a because accent
          is not thrown forward)
      Examples of simplified over-long diphthongs are:
        da‘ldi’n     (=*daildi’n)           I    shall    go    to    him      for    food;   compare

        oyo'n (=*oydn‘'n) I give it; compare third person oydn he gives it
   In the inferential, less frequently passive participle and impera-
tive, forms of the verb, double diphthongs, except those ending
in     w,     generally    fail   to    be        simplified.         If     coming     immediately |
before the inferential -k'- the double diphthong is preserved, for |
what reason is not evident (perhaps by analogy to other non-aorist
forms in which the last element of the double diphthong belongs to

  The possessive suffixes appended to the noun embrace elements
or the first and second persons singular and plural and for the third
rson; the form expressing the latter is capable of further ampli-
ication by the addition of an element indicating the identity of the
rossessor with the subject of the clause (corresponding to Latin swus
is contrasted with éius). This element may be further extended to
xpress plurality. Altogether four distinct though genetically related
eries of possessive pronominal affixes are found, of which three are
ised to express simple ownership of the noun modified; the fourth is
ised only with nouns preceded by pre-positives and with local adver-
vial stems.           The former set includes a special scheme for most terms
relationship, and two other schemes for the great mass of nouns, that
seem to be fundamentally identical and to have become differentiated
‘or phonetic reasons. None of these four pronominal. schemes is
dentical -with either the objective or any of the subjective series
‘ound        in the verb, though                     the pronominal                forms used with pre-
positives are very nearly coincident with the subjective forms found
in the future of Class II intransitives:

schemes lies in the first person plural; the first scheme is entirely
peculiar in the first person singular and third person. The first person
plural possessive suffix (-da’m) resembles the endings of the sub-
jective future of the same person (-iga’m, -anaga’m) in the falling
accent; evidently there is a primary element -a’m back of these
various endings which has amalgamated with other suffixes. As
seen from the table, reflexive suffixes exist only for the third person.

 w, s, y, h, l, m, and n do not differ naterially from the corresponding
 sounds in English.
    The first two series of stops—tenuis (p‘, é‘, k‘) and media (b, d, g)—
. do not exactly correspond to the surd and sonant stops of English or
 French.        The aspirated tenues are, as their name implies, voiceless
 stops whose release is accompanied by an appreciable expulsion of
 breath. The voiceless mediae are also stops without voiced articula-
 tion; but they differ from the true tenues in the absence of aspiration
 and in the considerably weaker stress of articulation. Inasmuch as
 our English mediae combine sonancy with comparatively weak stress
 of articulation, while the tenues are at the same time unvoiced and
 pronounced with decided stress, it is apparent that a series of con-
 sonants which, like the Takelma voiceless mediae, combine weak stress
 with lack of voice will tend to be perceived by an American ear some-
 times (particularly when initial) as surds, at other times (particularly
 between vowels) assonants. On the other hand, the aspirated tenues
 will be regularly heard as ordinary surd-stops, so that an untrained
 American ear is apt to combine an uncalled-for differentiation with a
 disturbing lack of differentiation.                        While the Takelma tenuis and
 media are to a large extent morphologically equivalent consonants
 with manner of articulation determined by certain largely mechanical
 rules of position, yet in a considerable number of cases (notably
 as initials) they are to be rigidly kept apart etymologically. Words
 and stems which differ only in regard to the weak or strong stress
 and the absence or presence of aspiration of a stop, can be found
 in great number:
        da*n- ear ; ‘Gn squirrel
        bd* now; p‘d""- to blow
        ga that; k‘a what
        di- on top; t‘i'- to drift
        bo“d- to pull out hair; p‘d¢d- to mix
        da*g- to build fire; da*g- to find; t‘d*g-to cry
        gai- to eat; k‘ai- thing, what !
    1 These two series of stops are not at all peculiar to Takelma.  As far as could be ascertained, the same
 division is found also in the neighboring Chasta Costa, a good example of how a fundamental method of
 phonetic attack may be uniformly spread over an area in which far-reaching phonetic differences of detail
 are found and morphologic traits vary widely.           The same series of stops are found also in Yana,in
 northern California.    Farther to the east the two series are apparently found, besides a series of true
 sonant stops, in Ponca and Omaha (J. O. Dorsey’s p, t, k, and d, 7, 7). The Iroquois also (as could be
 tested by an opportunity to hear Mohawk) are, as regards the manner of articulating the two series, abso-
 lutely in accord with the Takelma.     A more accurate phonetic knowledge of other languages would doubt-
 less show a wide distribution in America of the voiceless media.
      § 12
Boss]          HANDBOOK     OF INDIAN   LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                  83   The fortes (p/, t/, k/, ts! [=ts'!], and £, which has been put in the
same series because of its intimate phonetic and morphologic rela-
tion to the other consonants) are pronounced with the characteristic
snatched or crackly effect (more or less decided stress of articula-
tion of voiceless stop followed by explosion and momentary hiatus)
prevalent on the Pacific coast. From the point of view of Takelma,
p!, t!, and k/ are in a way equivalent to p*, ¢*, and k‘, respectively,
orrather to 6‘, d‘, and g*, for the fortes can never be aspirated.
In some cases it was found difficult to tell whether a fortis, or a voice-
less stop followed by a glottal stricture, was really heard:
     yapla‘ and yap*a‘ man
     ga’ plini’ and ga’ pint’ two
In fact, a final tenuis + a catch inserted, as between vowels, to pre-
vent phonetic amalgamation, regularly become, at least as far as
acoustic effect is concerned, the homorganic fortis:
        ak!a‘ he indeed   (=Gk‘ he + deictic ‘a‘; cf. ma’*a‘ you indeed)
        sdk !ett’ you shot him (= sak‘ he shot him + ()et¢' you are)
        maéip!a*‘ just you[pl.] (= map‘ you[pl.] + ‘a‘)
   Nevertheless, p*, ¢*, k* are by no means phonetically identical with
p!,t!,k!; in Yana, for instance, the two series are etymologically, as
well as phonetically, distinct. One difference between the two may
be the greater stress of articulation that has been often held to be
the main characteristic of the fortes, but another factor, at least as
far as Takelma (also Yana) is concerned, is probably of greater mo-
ment.    This has regard to the duration of the glottal closure.       In
the case of p’, t*, and k* the glottis is closed immediately upon release
of the stop-contact for p, t, and k. In the case of p/, t/, and k/ the
glottis is closed just before or simultaneously with the moment of con-—
sonant contact, is held closed during the full extent of the consonant
articulation, and is not opened until after the consonant release; the
fortis p/, e. g., may be symbolically represented as ‘p* (or *b*, better
ag BE, i. e., a labial unaspirated stop immersed in a glottal catch).
As the glottis is closed throughout the whole extent of the fortis
articulation, no breath can escape through it; hence a fortis conso-
nant is necessarily unaspirated. This explains why fortes are so apt
to be misheard as voiceless mediae or even voiced mediae rather than
as aspirated tenues (p/, e. g., will be often misheard as 6 rather than
p). The cracked effect of the fortes, sometimes quite incorrectly

 ber formed between the closed glottis and the point of consonant
 contact (compare the sound produced by the sudden withdrawal of
 a stopper from a closed bottle); the hiatus generally heard between
 a fortis and a following vowel is simply the interval of time elapsing
 between the consonant release and the release of the glottal closure.'
 That the fortis consonant really does involve an initial glottal catch
 is abundantly illustrated in the author’s manuscript material by such
 writings as:
        ditlii’*tlili’n = dilla’tiilien I stuff it
        dit'Ttlilin =di'itlin I shall stuff it
     leme’*k !a-udaé =leme’k ia-uda® as they go off
 Many facts of a phonetic and morphological character will meet us
  later on that serve to confirm the correctness of the phonetic analysis
{ given (see §13, end; also §§ 30,4; 40,6; 40,13a, p. 113; 40,13b). Here
  it is enough to point out that p/, t/, k/, ts’! are etymologically related
 to b, d, g, s° as are *, “, 1, m, *n to 4, u, l, m, n.
    There is no tenuis or media affricative (ts—dz; ts, te—dz"",dj) corre-
 sponding in Takelma to the fortis ts!/, ts:!, though it seems possible
 that it originally existed but developed to x (cf. yegwézi they bite
 me [upper Takelma yegwe’tci]; ts*!i’xi dog [from original *és-/its-1?)).
 Morphologically ts/, ¢s-! stand in the same relation to s, s- that p/, tl,
 and k! stand in to 6, d, g. For example,

 further forward (z). It frequently has a w tinge, even when no

aspirated tenuis k‘ followed by a voiceless labial continuant approxi-
mately equivalent to the wh of English wxHicu, more nearly to the
sound made in blowing out a candle. s is the ordinary English ¢ as
in SELL; while s is employed to represent a sibilant about midway in
place of articulation between s and c (= sh in English sHELL), the
fortes ts! and ¢s:! corresponding, respectively, in place of articulation
to s and 8. The two sounds s and s° have been put together, as it
is hardly probable that they represent morphologically distinct
sounds, but seem rather to be the limits of a normal range of varia-
tion (both sal- wirn Foor and s‘al-, e. g., were heard).            The only
distinction in use that can be made out is that s occurs more fre-
quently before and after consonants and after ‘:
     s‘a’s‘ant‘e® I shall stand

                         § 13. Final       Consonants
   By a “final” consonant will always be meant one that stands at
the end of a syllable, whether the syllable be the last in the word or
not. Such a final position may be taken only by the aspirated tenues,
the voiceless spirants, the catch, the liquid (2), and the nasals, not by
the voiceless mediae, fortes, and semivowels (y and w); hf occurs as
a final only very rarely:
      la‘h excrement
      lohlaha‘nk* he always caused them to die
A final semivowel unites with the preceding vowel to form a diph-
thong:         ,
        gayat he ate it (cf. gayawa’'n I ate it)
        gat grow! (cf. ga*ya’*t’ he will grow)
A final voiceless media always turns into the corresponding aspirated
surd; so that in the various forms of one stem a constant alternation
between the two manners of articulation is brought about:
        se*ba’*n I roasted it; sép‘ he roasted it
        xebe’*n he did it; zép‘ga* I did it
        zuduma/lda'n I whistle     to him;    zuduma’it',   ruduma'it‘gwa       he
          whistles to him
        tlayaga’'n I found it; tlaya‘k’ he found it, dak‘na®            since he
           found it

36                  BUREAU    OF   AMERICAN   ETHNOLOGY              [ BULL.40  A final fortis also becomes the corresponding aspirated surd (-ts!
becoming -‘s), but with a preceding catch by way of compensation
for the loss of the fortis character of the consonant.      This process is
readily understood by a reference to the phonetic analysis of the fortes
given above (§ 12). Final p/, for instance, really ‘b(‘), is treated in
absolutely parallel fashion to a final 6; the final media implied in
the p! must      become    an aspirated surd (this means, of course, that
the glottal closure is released at the same time as the stop, not sub-
sequently, as in the ordinary fortis), but the glottal attack of the %
still remains.  Examples are:

       k‘ap!a’k‘ap‘na‘n I throw them under (fire, earth); future, k‘a‘p-

tain limited number of possibilities occurring initially, while a larger

consonant combinations and syllabic initial consonants or permis-

possible in Takelma, the first members of the various combinations
being disposed in vertical columns and the second members, with
which the first combine, being given in horizontal lines. Examples

Also this form in -gwant‘gwi- was explained above.
                               § 51. Indirect Reflexive -gwa-  By indirect reflexive is here meant action in reference to somethi
belonging to one’s self, not action in behalf of one’s self.  Fromt
latter idea (expressed, as we have seen, by -[a]n[an]k‘wi- and -[a}n{an
t‘gwi-) the indirect reflexive in -gwa- differs in being always foundi
a transitive setting; from the comitative -(c)gw(a)- it differs phonet
ically in being formed only from transitive verbs with expressed objed
and in the constancy of the final -a- (third person aorist -k‘wa, not
-k‘~).      Examples of its use are:

   It will be noticed that whenever what in English we are accustom
to consider a direct reflexive is really such only in form, not in fact, t
Takelmaidiom requires the indirect -k‘wa- form, not the direct reflexi
in -gwi-. Thus, I SEE or SCRATCH MYSELF is not logically a reflexive
the same sense as I KILL, DROWN, or HANG MYSELF, the former involr
ing strictly action on what belongs to the subject, not on the subj
itself: 1 8EE or SCRATCH MY OWN (FLESH).                           Still such distinctions c¢

-dagwa and -daba‘n on the one hand, and of -¢‘gwa and -t‘ban on the

   The number of local elements that directly take on possessive suf-
fixes seems fairly considerable, and includes both such as are body-
part and local prefixes in the verb (e. g., dak‘-) and such as are used
in the verb only as local prefixes (e. g., wa-, dal-); a few seem not to
be found as verbal prefixes. Not all adverbially used verbal pre-
fixes, however, can be inflected in the manner of dak‘dz and wadé (e. g.,
no *hadé can be formed from fa-). A number of body-part and local |

                                 §85.   GENERAL            REMARKS
  The stem is in a very large number of cases parallel in form ta
that of a verbal base (e. g., with da‘n ROCK, 8’0i% MOUNTAIN, mia
CRANE, cf. tlan- HOLD, s*om- BOIL, he’m- WRESTLE).    An extensivé
number of noun-stems, however, are apparently amplifications of 4
simpler monosyllabic base, and have all the outward appearance d
an aorist stem in the verb. It becomes, then, not only possible, but
fundamentally important, to classify noun-stems into types that seem,
and ultimately doubtless are, entirely analogous in form to cot
responding verbal types. The noun-stem wili- HousE, for example,
can be conceived of as formed from a base wil- in the same mannd

rs)             HANDBOOK           OF INDIAN LANGUAGES—TAKELMA                                         2153 the aorist naga- is formed from the verb-stem n@*%g- sAY TO SOME
NE. Similarly, the noun yele‘s BURDEN-BASKET is phonetically
slated to a hypothetical base *yelz-, as is the aorist leme-k/- to the
on-aorist lem-k/-. A small number of nouns appear in two forms,
ne corresponding to the aorist stem, the other to the verb-stem of a
erb: gulu‘m oak, but with                    characteristic -(a)n-:gulm-an-(the                       non-
orist gula‘m with inorganic -a- also occurs). Similarly, yulu‘m and
ula‘m EAGLE. In such variable nouns we have a complete morpho-
gic analogy to Type 2 (or 3)) verbs like aorist zudum- WHISTLE,
erb-stem zut‘m- (with inorganic -a-:zudam-). In both gulu‘m and
udum- the -m- is almost certainly a suffixed element. It must be
arefully noted, however, that, while in the verb we very often have
oth the aorist stem and the base (as verb-stem) in actual existence,
1 the case of nouns we rarely can go beyond the stem as revealed in
n absolute or incorporated form. It is true that sometimes a
ypothetical noun-base phonetically coincides with a verbal base, but:
nly in the minority of cases can the two be satisfactorily connected.
‘hus, yut!-, abstracted from yut/u‘n puoK, is very probably identical
rith the yut!- of aorist yut!/wyad- SWALLOW GREEDILY LIKE HOG OR
cK.    On the other hand, little is gained by comparing the yul- of
wlu‘m EAGLE with the yul- of aorist yuluyal- ruB; the pliy- of
i’/yin DEER and p/i’yax FAWN with the aorist -p/iyin-(k‘wa-) Liz
IN PILLOW        (cf. gwen-p!tzap‘ PILLOW), unless the deer was so called,
or reasons of name-taboo, because its skin was used for the making
f pillows (or, more naturally, the reverse) ;1 the way- of waya‘ KNIFE
vith way- SLEEP; or the noun-stem yaw- RIB (occurring as ya-u- when
acorporated) with the verb-stem yaw- (yiw-) TALK.                                     It is not justi-
iable to say that noun-stems of apparently non-primitive form are
iecessarily amplified from the bases that seem to lie back of’ them
e. g., wili- from wil-; yulu-m from yul-), but merely that there is a                                           —

  Scheme III is followed by all nouns that have a characteristic
immediately preceding the personal suffix or, in nearly all cases,
whose stem, or stem + derivative suffix, ends in -a- (e. g., tlela‘t'k*
MY SHINNY-STICK [from t/ela‘]), -i-, -ei- (e. g., ts-lelett'k’ MY EYE
‘from ts: /elei-]), -n (e. g., sént‘k* My SKIN), ~m, or -l' (e. g., di*a‘lt'k'
 1In most, if not all, cases the -n, -m, or -I is a non-radical element.      It is not quiteclear in how far stems
ending in these vowels and consonants follow Scheme II or Scheme III.                                     §   92
 236                         BUREAU         OF    AMERICAN           ETHNOLOGY                            [sute.40 MY FOREHEAD              [from di‘‘al-]).             The third person is, at least super-
 ficially, without ending-in all nouns of this group whose pre-pro-
 nominal form is not monosyllabic. The third personal form is
 characterized by a falling accent on the final syllable, -a- and +
 being lengthened to -a’* and -7 respectively.                                   Other forms are:
      ts‘!ele’t his eye 27.8; 86.7, 9; (cf. 54.6)
        do“ma’l his testicles 130.8; 136.5
        2a%la’m his urine
        gwit!’n his wrist
 There is no doubt, however, that these forms without ending origi-
 nally had a final -¢', as indicated by the analogy of third personal
 forms in -da in Scheme II, and as proved by the preservation of the
 -t'- before the reflexive suffix -gwa and in monosyllabic forms:
       plant’ his liver 120.2, 15
        niv’tt’ her teats 30.14; 32.7
      t/t’ her husband (17,13)
      sa’*t‘ his discharge of wind 166.8
 Though the conditions for the loss of a final -¢' are not fully under-
 stood, purely phonetic processes having been evidently largely inter-
 crossed by analogic leveling, it is evident that the proportion wilt’!
 HIS HOUSE: nit’ HER TEATS = S‘dS‘int HE STANDS: Wit‘ HE TRAVELS
 ABOUT represents a by no means accidental phonetic and morphologic
 correspondence between noun and verb (Class II intransitives).
 The falling pitch is peculiar to the noun as contrasted with the verb-
‘form (cf. he’*l sone, but hél stne!). Monosyllabic stems of Scheme
 III seem to have a rising accent before -t‘gwa as well as in the first
 person.    Thus:
      lat‘gwa his own excrement 77.1
      t!tt'gwa her own husband (despite t/t/t') 45.14; (59.16; 60.2);
           128.22
 Nouns with characteristic -i- prefer the parallel form in ~1’-x-dagws
 to that in -i’-t‘gwa. Thus:
      bi“bini’xdagwa his own arm, rather than bi“bini’t‘gwa, despite
        bibini'‘t'k* My ARM
   The limitation of each of the two schemes to certain definite pho-
netically determined groups of nouns (though some probably merely
apparent contradictions, such as ga’l-'t‘ek‘ my Bow and di*a'‘l-ik'
  1.t'k' always requires preceding rising or raised accent. As gal- Bow seems to be inseparably connected
with a falling accent (very likely because of the catch in its absolute form), it is, after all, probably & phonetic
reason that causes
                it to follow Scheme
                                II rather than III.

netrical parallelism between the suffixes of both, make it practi-
‘ally certain that they are differentiated, owing to phonetic causes,
trom a single scheme.   The -a- of -da (-dagwa) and -daba‘n (as con-
Tasted with -t‘ and -t‘ban) may be inorganic in origin, and intended

xplained.             It isnot improbable that part of the endings of Scheme
OI      are due to aloss of an originally present vowel, so that                                        the
orimary scheme of pronominal suffixes may have been something like:
  Singular: First person, -d-ek‘; second person, -d-e*; third person, -t*.
Reflexive: Third person, -¢'-gwa.                      Plural: First person, -d-a’m; second
serson, -¢'-ba'n.
  It can hardly be entirely accidental that all the suffixes are char-
xwterized by a dental stop; perhaps an amalgamation has taken place
between the original pronominal elements and an old, formerly
significant nominal element -d-.

"   1It is possible that this suffix is really -k'a'n; -n after a catch is practically without sonority,a
very easily missed by the ear. The first person singular and plural inferential endings are then td
transitives in form (cf. -a&n and -ana‘k' as first person singular and plural subject of transitives); the thi
person is without ending in both. The ending -k'-a'n is made particularly likely by the subordinstt!
-k'-a’n-dat (see § 70).                                               :   The imperative is necessarily lacking in the first person singular an
third person. The first person plural in -(a)ba’¢ of the present impa
ative is used as a hortatory: yanaba’* LeT us Go! 158.11; (cf. 168.1]
This -(a)ba’¢ is not infrequently followed by emphasizing particles: -1
(e. g., yuba’*nt‘ LET Us BE! (cf. 158.8]) ; -hi (e. g., yetba’*hi LET UsBl
TURN! 63.1; see § 114, 2), or -ha‘n (e. g., ya’nabatha‘n LET Us Go 64.!
the last of these being clearly identical with the nominal plural ek
ment -han (see § 99) ; -nthan is also found (ya’nabaniha‘n LET Us AL
ao, PRAY! [cf. 150.24; 152.6]). No true future hortatory and secon
person plural imperative seem to exist; for the latter, the ordina
indicative form in -¢‘ba® (-daba* in the other classes) was always give
The connective -a- is used with most of the consonantal endings, |
indicated in the table, when the preceding part of the word ends in
consonant, otherwise the ending is directly attached ; in the reciproc
-t'p‘, -t', and -t'ba® are directly added to the suffix -an-. Before th
only vocalic ending, -i‘k', a glide -y- is introduced if the precedia
sound is a vowel (e. g., al-yowoyi‘k' wE Look).      In the first perso

st form of the second person plural imperative (-a‘np‘) is used to
llow most consonants (-‘np* to follow a“ constant”’ -a- of the stem),
9° being found only after vowels and probably m and n (e. g., yu‘p'
s xE!; yana‘p' Go YE!).
 In regard to the etymology of the endings, it is clear that the
cond person plural aorist is derived from the corresponding singular
rm by the addition of a characteristic -p‘ (cf. the imperative),
iat the second persons of the future are differentiated from the
wrist forms by an added -a‘, and that the first person singular future
 identical with the corresponding form in the aorist, except for the
ck of a catch. The second persons of the inferential are peri-
irastic forms, consisting of the third personal form in -k‘ (mode-
gn, not personal ending) plus ett’ THOU ART, ett'p‘ YE ARE.
As paradigmatic examples are chosen a stem ending in a vowel
sorist yowo- BE), one ending in a consonant (aorist baram- COME), a
ciprocal (aorist sd*nsan-san- FIGHT WITH ONE ANOTHER), and an
definite in -tau- (aorist t‘iiwi-g-iau- BE HOT).

oticed that a considerable number of the nouns given are such as
re generally apt to be derivative or non-primitive in morphology.
 In regard to accent monosyllabic nouns naturally divide themselves
ito two classes:—those with rising or raised accent, embracing the
reat majority of examples, and those with falling accent.                                    Of the
itter type a certain number owe their accent to a glottal catch of
he stem.        Besides ga’l‘, already given above, may be cited:

a few show variation between -a- and -z-; and but a very sm
number have -z- with or without preceding characteristic (e. g., gel-z-

   It is to be understood, of course, that this -a- is in no sense a
 characterizing future or non-aorist element, as, when the phonetic
* conditions allow, it drops out altogether. This takes place when the
  consonant following the intrusive —a- is itself followed by a vowel.
 Thus the second person singular future (-ada’*) of some of the verbs
 listed has no -a-: bilwada’’, gingada’‘, di“gada’®, witgada’*, yalnada'*.
 Similarly the simple stem zud- WHISTLE appears in zut‘ma’*s WHISTLER.
    In regard to vocalic quantity it will be observed that the verbs of
 this type divide themselves into two classes—those with short verb
 stem vowel (such as t/an-, og-, s‘om-d-, gin-g-, yal-n-) and those with
long verb-stem vowel (k!/6%y-, yal-x-ald-, li‘g-[a]n-, t'i*-g-, mil-[ajd-).
 The first and second stem vowels of the aorist of verbs of the first
 class are regularly both short (¢/ana-, ogo-, s'omo-d-, gini-g-, yala-n-);
 the aorists of the second class seem generally to have a short fir¢
 but long second vowel (k/oyo""-, yala*-a-ald, ligi*-n-, t’iiwit-g-, mili‘-d-).
 The verb na%g- (aorist naga-) say TO and perhaps a few others (sgii-
 p-x-,    aorist     sgaya-p-x-;   al-tslai-g- wasH      aorist       al-tslaya-g-;   but
 al-ts!ai-p‘- WASH        ONESELF,      aorist al-ts!aya*-p‘-) do not follow this
 rule.     Of the verb yo- (aorist yowo-) forms of both accent classes are
 found (yét‘e® as well as yo’t‘e’, yowo't‘e® as well as yowdt‘e‘), and
 indeed a lengthening of the second vowel of aorists of the first class
 seems to occur with considerable frequency.    The rising for long and
 the raised for final short stem vowels seem to be the normal accents
 for verbs of Type 2, whether the stress falls on the first or second
 (in aorists) vowel.         If, however, the accented vowel is followed bys
