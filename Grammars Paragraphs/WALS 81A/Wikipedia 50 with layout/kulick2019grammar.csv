"9.1 Simple sentencesA simple sentence in Tayap may consist of no more than an inflected verb. Thus,
a complex predicate like the serial verb construction discussed throughout the
previous chapter, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana ‘she intends to carry him down on her
shoulders’ is a fully formed sentence in Tayap. A simpler example is:(9-1) puko
      come_up.3pl.r
      ‘they came up’Word order is relatively flexible, since the grammatical relations of core constit-
uents and other elements are expressed through morphology and potentially
marked on NPs by case clitics like the ergative. However, Tayap is a verb-final
language and the unmarked order of elements in a declarative intransitive
sentence is Subject-Verb (SV), and in a declarative transitive sentence Subject-
Object-Verb (AOV):         subject        verb

        ‘the Sanae villagers buried the man’In transitive clauses that contain a subject, an object, and an oblique argument,
the order of object and oblique is fairly free, with the caveat that the object
never follows the verb, while the oblique argument can. Also, the subject nor-
mally occurs in the sentence-initial position. Some examples of various word
orders follow:          subject     direct     verb                                     oblique

9.2 Complex sentences: Coordinate, subordinate
    and cosubordinate clausesComplex sentences consist of coordinate, cosubordinate or subordinate struc-
tures. The following suffixes and free morphemes function to express these
clause types.","[270, 271, 272]"
"4.3.2 Ergativity in the speech of young peopleYoung villagers under thirty who narrated stories for me in Tayap produced erga-
tive constructions in their speech, but they had a tendency to overuse the ergative
markers on intransitive verbs. The subjects of intransitive verbs like ‘be’, ‘cry’,
‘stand’, ‘talk’, ‘shiver’ and ‘work’ were all marked with ergative case marking in
various young people’s narratives.
     Even when used in transitive verb phrases, the ergative morpheme was
sometimes attached to constituents that were not the subjects of the verb. For
example, one twenty-three-year-old man narrated a story about how a young girl
had accused him of having raped her.
     In telling the story, he said the following (note that the ellipsis denotes a
series of false starts and repetitions that have been omitted, and the ergative mor-
pheme is highlighted in bold):(4-38) Mosi katota namnin, ‘Ŋayarke yu Yengia…morasi aproyi nitukun’?
       Mosi katot             -a     nam -n -i            -n
       Mosi go_down.sg.m.r -and tell.r -s <1sg.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s       ŋayar =ke yu Yengia morasi         apro                 =yi
       true  =q 2sg Yengia habit/behavior bad                  =erg.f       ni     -tu -ku              -n
       do.r -s      <3sg.f.r.o>    -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
       ‘Mosi went down and told me ‘Is it true that you did something bad to
       Yengia?’
120          4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionThere are semantic and grammatical errors in this sentence,2 but of interest here
is the ergative clitic, which the speaker attaches to the object noun phrase ‘bad
deed’ instead of to the subject of the verb phrase, ‘you’.
     I suspect that this error occurred because the speaker seems to know that the
verb nir- (‘do’ or ‘make’) usually co-occurs with an ergative marker. But his sense
appears to be that the marker attaches to the noun or noun phrase that immedi-
ately precedes the verb; not necessarily the subject of the verb phrase.
     This is a typical error made by speakers under thirty. It indicates that young
speakers have parsed the ergative case marker as a formulaic part of a verb
phrase involving certain verbs – in particular, the verbs ‘know’, ‘say’ and ‘do’.
But these speakers seem to be not entirely aware that the marker does particular
syntactic and semantic work. If the ergative case clitic was really a strong marker
of agency, control or animacy one might expect speakers to be aware of that,
albeit subconsciously, and make mistakes accordingly; however that does not
seem to be the case.
     In addition to having problems with the placement and the function of
the ergative clitic, young speakers also often make mistakes of gender with it.
They overextend the feminine form =yi and use it when talking about males and
plural referents. So they say things like sas=yi (‘father=erg.f’, instead of sas=ŋi
‘father=erg.m’) and njenum=yi (dog.pl=erg.f, instead of the correct njenum=gi
‘dog.pl=erg.pl’).
     This overextension of =yi probably occurs because =yi is the ergative ending
on the 1sg and 2sg pronouns (ŋa=yi and yu=yi). Speakers would have heard the
yuyi form all their lives, every time an older speaker ordered them to carry or take
or fetch or hit something. And since the narratives that people in Gapun tell one
another are almost invariably accounts of personal experiences – what the nar-
rator him or herself saw, heard, dreamt, etc. – the ŋayi form would also be very
salient for speakers. Furthermore, the unmarked gender in Tayap is feminine see
Section 3.1.3. That young speakers would overextend the feminine form, rather
than the masculine =ŋi, is therefore not surprising.","[139, 140]"

"Grammatical words generally coincide with phonological words in Tayap
(however see Section 8.2, example (8–3) for a counter-example). Grammatical
words consist of “a number of grammatical elements which (i) always occur
together rather than scattered throughout the clause (…); (ii) occur in fixed order;
and (iii) have a conventionalized coherence and meaning” (Aikhenvald 2007: 2).
     In Tayap, verbs are grammatical words which minimally must always occur
with person and/or status marking except in certain restricted morphosyntac-
tic environments. Even the longest and most complex of the complex predicates
described in Chapters 8 and 9 consist of single grammatical words, sharing as they
do various properties like marking for arguments and/or realis/irrealis status. Thus
the example discussed in detail in Chapter 8, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana, ‘she intends to
carry him down on her shoulders’, is a single phonological and grammatical word.
     However grammatical words do not necessarily have to be inflected. Verbs
are normally inflected, but nouns, pronouns, particles and other minor classes
can occur without inflection.
                                                               Orthography        45
2.8 OrthographyThe Tayap orthography in this grammar and dictionary uses letters of the English
alphabet that correspond to the language’s phonemes, with two exceptions: ɨ
and ŋ. The phonemes /ɵ/ and /ŋ/ would be difficult to render using the letters
used to write English or Tok Pisin. Tayap is almost never written, and any villager
who does so invents his or her own nonce orthography. In my years of contact with
the villagers, I have received many letters from them, always written in Tok Pisin.
At the very end of these letters, though, after the writer has finished asking me for
money (which is always the sole reason for sending me a letter), he or she often
concludes with a line written in Tayap, to add coercive punch to the requests.
     A typical example is the phrase Aowo grag engon yu na na, which occurred at
the very end of a letter that had just instructed me to send the writer the equiva-
lent of $8,000 (at a time when the yearly income for the entire village was about
$500). The interjection aowo is an orthographic rendering of a sound used by
villagers to convey worry and longing, and the rest, ‘good evening to you’, is a
Tayap calque of Tok Pisin’s “gutpela apinun long yu”. The unambiguous meaning
of the Tayap phrase is: ‘I worry about you, so now you worry about me and send
me eight thousand dollars’.
     The orthography that villagers have come up with to write Tayap varies from
writer to writer and from occasion to occasion. However, one convention that has
developed over the years regards /ɵ/, which is sometimes written as h, and /ŋ/,
which is often rendered as either nh or ngh. This convention may be the invention
of Amburi Waiki, who was in his late twenties and the village prayer leader in the
mid-1980s. Amburi was the only person in Gapun to write anything in Tayap at
that time, and his orthography – which he himself applied erratically – was seen
by others and perhaps adopted by them. (What Amburi wrote on loose pages and
in school workbooks were the names of villagers who had contributed money to
the village church, and the names of areas of rainforest that he wanted to note
down for various reasons.)
     This way of handling Tayap’s phonemes results in a sentence like the follow-
ing, which Amburi wrote down for me in the 1980s: Ngha nghing ana mbet (‘I have
come for them’).
     The problem with the orthography used to write this sentence is that it is
difficult for villagers to parse and read. It makes no distinction between free and
bound morphemes (-ana, ‘for’ or ‘to’, for example, is a bound morpheme that
cannot occur on its own), and literate villagers, who have learned to read by being
drilled in school with texts in English, have difficulty with the sheer number of
letters used to denote simple sounds. (In the orthography used in this grammar
and dictionary the sentence would be written Ŋa ŋgɨnana mbet.)
46        2 Phonology and orthography      A sentence produced in 2009 by a literate villager who I asked to demonstrate
to me how he would write something in Tayap shows that the same problems
have persisted: Nhang nhan patir engon nhayar (‘My house is very nice’). The
orthography is internally inconsistent – the word written engon is pronounced
[εŋgɔn], and thus should be written enhgon, if the conventions of this orthogra-
phy were followed consistently.
      This orthography also quickly gets messy. For example, in the sentence just
quoted, a common word like ŋaŋan (‘my’) is written as two words and spelled
nhang nhan. In other instances, simple pronouns like ŋɨ [ŋɵ] (‘he’) and ŋgɨ [ŋgɵ]
(‘they’) tend to stump village writers, who might write them as nghi and nghgh,
respectively – although they would more likely avoid writing them or give up
trying to write them.
      Words with the consonant cluster /ŋg/ also pose difficulties. A name like
‘Saŋgi’ – which the villagers’ orthography should render as something like
Sanhgi – looks strange to the villagers when they see it written out in this way
(they would in this case write ‘Sangi’). Worse, a name like ‘Saŋgiŋgi’, which
might be written something like Sanhginhgi, would make villagers who try to use
their invented orthography throw up their hands in despair.
      Because of those difficulties, which villagers perceive and talk about them-
selves, I do not adopt their orthographic inventions to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/. Instead, I
introduce two additional letters, ɨ and ŋ. These letters are ordered so that ɨ follows
i in the alphabet, and ŋ follows n.
      While I depart from the villagers’ attempts to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/, I do follow
their loose convention of orthographically marking prenasalization on the voiced
word-initial stops /b/ and /d/ and on the affricate /dʒ/. Villagers vary on whether
or not they orthographically mark word-initial nasalization on the velar stop
/g/: a word like ‘cassowary’, spelled ŋgat in this orthography, would probably be
written ngat by most villagers.
      On the other hand, though, some of them write ŋgrag ‘evening’ as grag (see
above, the example of a villager’s letter asking me for $8,000). Regardless of how
they would write a word-initial /g/, however, Tayap speakers consistently prena-
salize the phoneme when they pronounce it in this position. Hence, I mark this
in the orthography.
      This concession to village pronunciation and writing conventions means that
the orthography used here is not as economical as it otherwise might have been.
I could have omitted the nasalization in words beginning with /b/, /d/, /j/ and
/g/ and simply noted that those phonemes are all obligatorily nasalized word-
initially (this is what Christopher Stroud and I did in our 1993 sketch grammar).
      In the end, though, I decided that since the only people who might conceiv-
ably ever actually use the orthography employed here are the speakers of Tayap,
                                                                 Orthography        47
their perceptual biases and already-established habits were more important than
an economical orthography. As I just noted, villagers who write anything in Tayap
vary in whether or not they mark the prenasalization before a word-initial /g/. But
they would find it counter-intuitive and odd to see or write bor ‘pig’, je ‘dog’ or der
‘path’ when they say – and would write – mbor, nje and nder.
     I therefore write words the way the villagers pronounce them, with the result
that there are no words in the dictionary that begin orthographically with b, d, j
or g.
     Word-medial and word-final prenasalized consonants are written as they are
most commonly pronounced, thus the j in munje ‘man’ is written as prenasalized,
as it is normally pronounced, versus mbubujiram ‘bubbles from fish, crocodiles,
turtles emerging from underwater’, which is written unprenasalized.
     This orthographic convention would also logically entail changing the spell-
ing of the villagers’ home, Gapun, to Ŋgapun. However, ‘Gapun’ is not a Tayap
word. Senior men in the 1980s told me that they had heard that Germans had
given the name Gapun to their village – which is called Tayap num ‘Tayap village’
in Tayap.
     No one knows why ‘Gapun’ was chosen, but the most likely explanation is
that when German cartographers and labor recruiters first appeared in the lower
Sepik area in the early decades of the 1900s, they asked coastal villagers the
names of inland villages which they could not reach, and they wrote down some
version of the names they received in response. The Kopar-language name for
Gapun, for example, is Saŋgap.
     No great leap of imagination is required to see how a name like that, through
various mis-hearings and confusions, could end up as Gapun. A significant per-
centage of the colonial records from the lower Sepik area were destroyed during
WWII, so I have been unable to uncover any information that directly sheds light
on the question of why Gapun is called Gapun.
     But whatever the story behind the German naming of the village may be, the
spelling of ‘Gapun’ can remain unchanged, since it is not a Tayap word.
     Note that stress is marked where it is a property of a lexical morpheme (for
example, wákare (‘no’), but in the rest of the grammar it is not marked it when it
is a product of complex morpho-phonemics e.g. like kakúndara in (2-14a) above.
     Out of respect for villagers’ writing habits (and also to be consistent with the
analysis of the language’s phonology discussed above, where no VVV clusters
are permitted), I have also changed the spelling of the name of the language and
people from Taiap – as I have spelled it in all my previous work on Gapun – to
Tayap.
     Whenever villagers write their name for themselves, they always spell it
Tayap. And the word is a popular one to write. The front of one house near the
48        2 Phonology and orthographycenter of the village, for example, is adorned with large letters, painted in black
battery acid, that proclaims (tellingly, in Tok Pisin), NIU LUK TAYAP (‘New Look
Tayap’).
     Another young man, upping the linguistic ante in the direction of what many
villagers have understood is the even more prestigious language, used similar
material to paint the words NEW HOME TAYAP on a wall in his house.
     A young man with whom I was walking along the beach one day, making
the six-hour trip to the village of Watam to see if the local health worker there
had any medicine for a bad case of scabies I had acquired in the village (she
didn’t), paused at one point to scratch the words NICK OUTCAST PERSON K*B*H*
ROR TAYAP MUNJE into the sand. Translated, this means ‘Nick outcast person
K[ambedagam] B[lue] H[ill] child Tayap man’ – the K*B*H* part of the message
being a name the young villagers have given to their mountain.
     Nick’s scribble in the sand doesn’t make much sense in either of the two lan-
guages in which it is written. But that is typical of the way that the word Tayap is
used in young villagers’ writing: it is used more as a marker or a tag than as an
attempt to convey referential meaning. Nick’s writing is a slightly more elaborate
variant of the words Tayap ror (Tayap child), which is a popular tag that young
men and women like to carve into trees or add after their signature at the end of
a love letter. The words are modeled on the Tok Pisin word “mangi”, which used
to mean ‘child’, but which during the past thirty years has acquired the sassier
meaning of ‘young person’ or, better, ‘kid’.
3 Word classesTayap has two open classes of words – nouns (Section 3.1) and verbs (Section 3.2) –
and a number of closed classes:     3.3 adjectives                  3.8 deictics

"Authorship of this bookThe first person pronoun used throughout this work refers to Don Kulick. I col-
lected all the linguistic and ethnographic data analyzed here over the course of
my thirty years’ work in Gapun. As mentioned above, I wrote the entire first draft
of this grammar and dictionary and submitted it for review at Pacific Linguistics in
2011. Shelving the project to complete other work, I took it up again in 2017, when
I approached linguist Angela Terrill, who had trained in descriptive linguistics at
ANU and written a grammar of the Papuan language, Lavukaleve, to collaborate
with me in rewriting the text (Terrill 2003). Angela worked on the morphological
and grammatical analysis in preparing the manuscript for publication.

Conventions and abbreviations
Tayap examples in the grammar usually consist of four lines. The first is the Tayap
speech written in bounded, unsegmented words.
     The second line is the same clause or sentence in which the words have been
separated into morphemes.
     The third line is the interlinear gloss of the morphemes. The space separating
the morphemes in the second and third lines is larger than it is in most grammars
for reasons of readability. The usual manner of presentation, in which glosses for
morphemes are chained together in long, complicated strings, assumes readers
with a great deal of specialized knowledge, experience and patience. Separat-
ing the morphemes should make the glosses easier to process. The spacing does
admittedly make it a bit harder to see individual words, but those appear in the
first line of the examples.
     The fourth line is the translation into English.
     An example is as follows:(1) Merewŋgrogi munje parŋgɨro
    Merew -ŋgro =gi             munje par     -ŋgɨ       -ro
    Sanae    -pl     =erg.pl man       bury.r -3sg.m.r.o -3pl.r.s
    ‘the Sanae villagers buried the man’Suffixes are marked by hyphens (-) and clitics are marked with an equal sign (=).
In Tayap there are no prefixes, only suffixes, and enclitics rather than proclitics.
      Some glossing conventions used throughout this grammar in the interlinear
glosses need to be noted. Tayap verbs – and other words – have a broad range of
meanings, and an o, for example, is consistently glossed as ‘strike’ in the interlin-
ear glosses, but is translated to its context-specific meaning as ‘hit’, ‘stab’, ‘kill’,
etc. in the translation. Similarly, the Locative case has a broad range of meanings.
It is glossed as loc when it has a locational meaning but in other contexts it may
be glossed as temp for temporal, com for comitative or all for allative.
      Further conventions need explanation are as follows:
      The first is the pipeline symbol | which appears in example 3 below under-
neath the final morpheme -n. This symbol means that the morpheme it glosses
has more than one meaning. Disambiguation occurs through the use of pronouns
or nouns, or through context.
      An S is used in glossing transitive verbs to show features of the subject. With
intransitive verbs, the person/number/status of subjects are marked in the lan-
guage but there is no S in the gloss.

                                            Conventions and abbreviations     XIX
    Another convention concerns Tayap’s discontinuous subject markers. Some
verbs have subject morphemes that occur both before and after the object mor-
pheme. An example is as follows:(2) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
    ŋgu    =yi      aram ta  -tɨ  -ŋgɨ                  -n
    3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -r.s -3sg.m.r.o            -r.s
    ‘she saw a snake’In this verb, the combination of -tɨ before the object morpheme and -n after the
object morpheme encodes either a 2sg or 3sg.f subject in realis status. The
pronoun ‘she’ disambiguates the subject to be 3sg.f, in this case. Since it is the
combination of the two discontinuous subject morphemes that produces meaning,
the labeling convention adopted here is to gloss the first subject morpheme
with ‘s’ (‘subject’), and to gloss the combined meaning of the two morphemes
under the second morpheme. The object morpheme in verbs like this case occurs
between the two subject markers, and is bounded by < > instead of hyphens, to
show that it intervenes between the two discontinuous subject markers.
    So in this grammar, the example above is written as:(3) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
    ŋgu    =yi      aram ta  -tɨ         -ŋgɨ        -n
    3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -s-         <3sg.m.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
    ‘she saw a snake’The abbreviations used in the interlinear glosses otherwise generally follow the
Leipzig glossing rules.
    Note that the dictionary uses some different terms and abbreviations (see
page 351 for those).

1 The Tayap language and its speakers1.1 General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in
    GapunTayap is the name of a Papuan language spoken by a dwindling number of people,
most of whom live in a small village called Gapun (the speakers themselves call
the language Tayap mer, which means, precisely, ‘Tayap language’). Gapun is
located on the Papua New Guinea mainland, between the Sepik and Ramu rivers,
about thirty kilometers inland from the northern coast. The village is far from
roads of any kind and is difficult to reach. It lies in a mosquito- and leech-infested
swamp in the middle of the rainforest (see Map 1.1).
     The Tayap language is tiny, even by the extreme standards of Papua New
Guinea, where one linguist estimated that thirty five percent of the languages
have fewer than five hundred speakers (Sankoff 1980: 96). As far as anyone in
Gapun has been able to remember, Tayap has never had more than, at most, just
over one hundred speakers. That small number seems to have remained stable for
a very long time. By the 1980s, however, children were no longer learning Tayap
as their first language. Instead, they were learning Tok Pisin, the most important
and widely-spoken national language of Papua New Guinea.
     I began my work in Gapun in 1985. At that time, the number of people who
actively commanded Tayap – in the sense that they spoke it with other villagers
and were able to narrate stories in it – was about ninety, out of a population of
about one hundred and thirty (most but not all of whom lived in Gapun). Twenty
three years later, in 2009, the population of Gapun had grown to two hundred
and eight people. In addition, seventeen people who had been born and raised
in Gapun had left the village (mostly because of conflicts over land rights and
sorcery accusations) and moved to the village of Wongan, which is a ninety-
minute trip from Gapun, by foot and then dugout canoe across a vast mangrove
lagoon.
     If we were to include those people in a count of Gapuners the total population
would be two hundred and twenty five. And if their children, most of whom were
born and raised in Wongan, were to be included, the number of people who could
reasonably claim to be a Gapuner would be close to three hundred.
     Any way Gapuners are counted, it is clear that their numbers have doubled
over the past twenty years. However, during that same time, old people have died
and children have continued to learn Tok Pisin as their first language. By 2009,
fewer than twenty people still living in Gapun had grown up with Tayap as their
first language.https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-001

116       4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionFor those reasons, ŋɨ ŋgat poŋgɨn can potentially be understood to mean either
‘he speared the cassowary (with a spear)’ or ‘the cassowary struck him’ (that is,
pierced his body with the knife-like claws on its feet).
    Using the ergative case marker resolves ambiguity by marking the transitive
subject who performs the action. So compare:(4-30) a. ŋɨŋi ŋgat poŋgɨn
          ŋɨ=ŋi            ŋgat      po -ŋgɨ                         -n
          3sg.m=erg.m cassowary shoot.r -3sg.m.r.o                   -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘he speared the cassowary’       b. ŋgatŋi ŋɨ poŋgɨn
          ŋgat=ŋi            ŋɨ      po         -ŋgɨ   -n
          cassowary=erg.m 3sg.m shoot.r -3sg.m.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘the cassowary speared him’ (with its claws)Note that it is not the case that when two NPs (A and O) are present the ergative
marking must be used. The following example contains a verb that is highly tran-
sitive with two NP arguments present but there is no ergative:(4-31) ŋgɨ ŋgomar tarmbrar ŋgwok
       ŋgɨ ŋgomar tar            -mb       -rar ŋgwok
       3pl fish       take.irr -3pl.r.o -ml go.3pl.r
       ‘They picked up fish as they walked’However there are also many examples in which there can be no ambiguity, and
yet an ergative marker is used:(4-32) mbumjorŋi minjikankɨ nda kokɨr kukupemiet
       mbumjor=ŋi              minjikan -kɨ                nda     kokɨr
       Mbumjor_snake=erg.m nearby         -intens          dm      head       ku      -ku         pemiet
       bring -3sg.f.r.o rise_up.sg.m.r
       ‘the snake raised his head really close’One verb that virtually always marks its subject with the ergative clitic is kiraw-
when it conveys the meaning of ‘know’ (this verb also has a range of other
meanings, including ‘consider something’, ‘recognize something’ and ‘taste
something’); note that this example has the unusual structure of a preposed
head, with possessive phrase following.
                                                    The ergative case (erg)       117
(4-33) orak orak aŋgo sumbwaŋaŋi ŋɨ kirawtɨŋgɨn ainde
       orak orak aŋgo sumbwa =ŋa              =ŋi     ŋɨ
       thing thing dx.f ground =poss =erg.m 3sg.m       kiraw     -tɨ -ŋgɨ            -n            ainde
       know.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s dx.m
       ‘this thing of the ground knows about him.’Perception verbs may or may not have subjects carrying the ergative marker.
Compare the following: (4-34a), which marks the subject with the ergative clitic,
and (4-34b), which doesn’t:(4-34) a. yim noni tarkru wákareŋan noni tankun
          yim non       =i        tar        -kru             wákare      =ŋan

           indef =erg.f hear.r -s <3sg.f.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
           ‘Some of us didn’t hear it, some did hear it.’       b. Akupi ŋgume ŋɨ tankun aŋgude
          Akupi ŋgu     -me ŋɨ
          Akupi 3sg.f -dx 3sg.m           ta     -n -ku              -n           aŋgude
           see.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s dx.f
           ‘He saw Akupi [’s spirit]’4.3.1.1 Ergative clitics on intransitive verbs
The main function of ergative clitics is to mark the subject of a transitive verb.
In Tayap, however, the ergative marker can also be attached to the subject of an
intransitive verb.
     This marked use often carries a particular nuance, which can be illustrated
by an example taken from a narrative about a powerful crocodile water-spirit
named Ŋgayam. In telling this story, the narrator uses the ergative with an intran-
sitive verb:(4-35) Ŋgayamŋi mbet
       Ŋgayam =ŋi    mbet
       Ŋgayam =erg.m come.3sg.m.r
       ‘Ŋgayam came’
118       4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionThe ergative here carries the connotation of purposefulness. The implication
is that Ŋgayam didn’t just come – he came with a purpose, to do something, to
perform some kind of action. And indeed he did: the story tells of how Ŋgayam
flooded the rainforest and drowned an entire kin group as they stood gathering
his children – who had the form of fish – in his jungle streams. A version of this
story appears at the end of this grammar as Tayap Text 2.
     Another telling instance of an ergative marker on an intransitive verb
occurred once when men from the neighboring village of Sanae arrived in
Gapun unannounced a few days after one of their relatives had been attacked
by a Gapuner. Everyone in Gapun was fearful of the Sanae men, because it was
assumed that they had come to fatally bewitch the attacker or one of his matri-
lineal relatives. As the Sanae men arrived in Gapun, villagers whispered to one
another:(4-36) Merewŋgrogi ŋgwek
       Merew -ŋgro =gi           ŋgwek
       Sanae -pl       =erg.pl come.3pl.r
       ‘the Sanae [men] are coming’The use of the ergative in this case meant that the Sanae men were not just drop-
ping by Gapun on an innocent visit to socialize. They were coming to accomplish
a particular sinister purpose.
    This use of the ergative to mark intentionality on intransitive verbs is also
apparent in cases where the ergative is used to denote a remarked-upon lack of
intentionality. The following example was uttered by a woman screaming abuse
at her relatives because her nephew littered the ground in front of her house with
seeds he blew from a homemade pea-shooter (i.e. in front of the house of the
woman having the “kros”, see Kulick 1992: 104–113 and Kulick 1993 for details on
these kinds of antagonistic speech events):(4-37) yumŋni mburaiakaku wákare!
       yum =ŋi          mburai     -ak           aku       wákare
       2pl =erg.m sweep.irr -link                be.irr    neg
       ‘you all never sweep!’Here the ergative clitic on an intransitive verb (mburai ‘sweep’) inflected in the
negative habitual aspect (see Section 8.3.2) highlights the consistent lack of
intention on the part of her addressees to perform an act that she thinks they
ought to consider doing occasionally.
                                                     The ergative case (erg)    119
    Suter’s (2010) description of optional ergativity in the Trans New Guinea
language Kâte shows that the ergative marker is most likely to be used in
clauses with the marked word order of OSV (as opposed to the usual SOV) or
when a focus particle is used on the subject (Suter 2010: 435). In other Trans
New Guinea languages, factors include animacy, agency and control (Suter
2010: 436).
    As we have seen, however, there seems to be no single factor or group of
factors which account for the use or absence of the ergative marker in Tayap.","[135, 136, 137, 138, 139]"

5 Basic verb morphology5.1 General properties of Tayap verbsIn Tayap a single complex predicate can express the equivalent of an entire
sentence in English. This is most apparent in its serial verb constructions,
which can express a complex action like ‘she intends to carry him down on
her shoulders’ in a single predicate (tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana). Serial verb con-
structions like this are discussed in Chapter 8. For basic sentence structure, see
Section 9.1.
    Transitivity, TAM (tense, aspect and mood) and realis/irrealis status are mor-
phologically encoded in verbs by suffixes, with the object suffix preceding the
subject suffix.
    In transitive verbs, this occurs in the following manner:(5-1) a. poŋgro

do so in a more fusional manner than is the case for transitive verbs, especially in
the non-future tense (which expresses events or actions that are occurring in the
present or that have occurred in the past).
    An example of intransitive verbs is the verb poror ‘sing’. Some of the forms
that this verb takes in the non-future and the future tenses are as follows:(5-2) a. poror-net                          poror-nak                   poror-ŋguk

(except in certain modification constructions, see Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2), and
which also never occur without being marked for status, either realis or irrealis
(although some verbs, e.g. poror above have the same stem for both). The root
forms of these stems – that is, the forms that are available for derivational pro-
cesses like nominalization, and the citation forms that are entered in the diction-
ary as the lexical entry for a verb – are the irrealis forms of the stem.
     A note is in order on the terms “roots” and “stems” as they are used here.
Roots are the lexical parts of a word, the unanalyzable part left once the
affixes are all taken off. Stems are involved when inflectional affixes apply to
different forms of a root (Aikhenvald 2007: 38–40). So Tayap verb roots have
inflectional stems: that is, for instance, there are separate inflectional stems
for realis and irrealis. In this grammar, “stem” refers to the inflectional possi-
bilities of a verb root, and “root” designates the basic underlying lexical part
of the verb.
     Verbs in Tayap have the following structure:                                    V – O – (A)
                                      V – (S)Note that verbal morphology, unlike clausal relations, follows a nominative-
accusative alignment system.
    Verbs in Tayap mark the following elements:Status
Has the action of the verb happened or is happening? Has it not happened?","[155, 156, 157]"
"4.1.1 Noun phrase structureNoun phrase structure is as follows:     [PossP Part HEAD Mod* Quant]=casePossP is a possessive phrase and Part is a participle; the head follows these. In the
Mod(ifier) slot, either an adjective or a numeral, or both, in that order, can occur,
or a relative clause, or alternatively a possessive phrase. Non-numeral quantifiers
follow, and the final element of an NP is a case-marking clitic. The head noun
itself can be reduplicated.
     Noun phrases themselves are readily elided, but if an NP is present, its head
is obligatory, or very rarely elided if retrievable from context. The head appears
together with any applicable case marking. The head can be a noun, modified or
not, or a pronoun. Some examples follow:
Subject NP expressed by free pronoun:(4-1) ŋgɨ nam tankuro

       are responsible.","[125, 126, 127]"

Most of these kin terms, and certainly their dual and plural forms, are mori-
bund. Several of them – oiŋga ‘daughter-in-law, woman speaking’, njanimb
‘great-grandchild’, ombre ‘father-in-law, male speaking’, otre ‘mother-in-law,
male speaking’ – were produced only after several conversations among Gapun’s
oldest Tayap speakers. There is disagreement about whether one of them – eŋki,
‘husband of maternal aunt, male speaking’ – is even a Tayap word. Several people
suggested that it might be a borrowing from the Adjora language spoken in the
                                                                       Nouns        53
nearby village, Sanae. However, since old men in the 1980s told me it was, and
since it has a Tayap plural, I include it here.
     Villagers under forty all know common words like munje ‘man’, noŋor ‘woman’
and ror ‘child’, and they know their plural forms, but most do not know their dual
forms. Most kin terms have been either forgotten or replaced with words from Tok
Pisin. So oyeŋg ‘in-law’ has been replaced by Tok Pisin’s “tambu”, neni ‘grandfa-
ther’ has been replaced with “apa man”, and keke ‘grandmother’ with “apa meri”.
     Words like mambrag ‘spirit of a dead person’ and kandap ‘forest being’ are kept
alive by mothers who use them to frighten their small children, so everyone knows
them. The plural forms, however, are not known by speakers under thirty-five.
     The two non-human nouns that have plural forms are:
      Singular      Pluraldog   nje           njenum
pig   mbor          mboreirum
3.1.2 The animacy/genericness distinction in nounsThe animate-inanimate/generic distinction is fundamental in Tayap, and is
marked by two kinds of morphemes that are attached to nouns.
    The first are peripheral case clitics, that denote relations like location or
dative (see Section 4.4). Several of these clitics have different forms for animate
and inanimate/generic referents. Note, for example, the different clitics that
express movement towards something or someone – an animate referent takes
=re and an inanimate referent takes =nɨ (see Section 4.4 for the complexities of
the animate/inanimate division):(3-12) a. ŋgu    Mairum =re                wok
          3sg.f Mairum =all (animate) go.3sg.f.r
          ‘she went to Mairum (personal name)’       b. ŋgu    mɨri         =nɨ           wok
          3sg.f rainforest =all (inanimate) go.3sg.f.r
          ‘she went to the rainforest’
3.1.2.1 Animacy/genericness marked through possessive morphemes
Animacy/genericness is also marked on NPs by the enclitics that signal possession
(see Section 4.5 for discussion of possession). The possessive clitics express animacy/
54       3 Word classesgenericness and number. They have optional consonant-final forms: The condition-
ing factors between the vowel-final and consonant-final forms are unknown.
                       singular      pluralanimate                =ma(t)        =mandama(t)
inanimate/generic      =ŋa(n)        =ŋa(n)Examples are:(3-13) a. mbor =mat ŋgagon
          pig      =poss tail
          ‘pig’s tail’       b. Sopak =mat sapwar
          Sopak =poss basket
          ‘Sopak’s basket’       c. mɨri         =mat mbor
          rainforest =poss pig
          ‘wild pig’ – as opposed to a numŋa mbor, a domestic pig, of the village       d. num      sami =mat morasi
          village many =poss custom
          ‘the custom of many villages’The possessive clitics attach to the last word of the noun phrase expressing the pos-
sessor. The order between possessor and possessed is free, so both Sopak=ma(t)
sapwar (Sopak’s basket) and sapwar Sopak=ma(t) (basket Sopak’s), or mɨri=ŋa
mbor (forest’s pig) and mbor mɨri=ŋa (pig forest’s) are possible. Placing the np +
poss constituent last emphasizes it.
    For animate plurals, the possessive clitic is =mandama(t). For example:(3-14) a. Potow     =mandamat morasi
          Wongan =poss.pl         behavior
          ‘the behavior of the Wongan people’       b. mbor rorsem =mandama tawk
          pig    child.pl =poss.pl         plate
          ‘the baby pigs’ plate’ (that they eat from)When speaking in general terms, =ŋa(n) is used even with animate nouns. For
example:
                                                                     Nouns          55

3.1.3 Gender in nounsGender is a ubiquitous feature of Tayap. A common category in Papuan languages
in general (Foley 2000: 371), in particular in non-Trans New Guinea languages
(Ger Reesink pers. comm.), the pervasiveness of gender in Tayap, and the way it is
marked across the grammar, differentiates it from the languages that surround it
and gives it a reputation in the area as being a “hard” language.
    Non-speakers of Tayap perceive the prominent role that gender marking
plays in Tayap because they hear speakers telling one another to do things, and
the imperative forms of intransitive verbs are inflected according to the gender
(and number) of the addressee(s).
    So – to use the example that Gapun villagers themselves inevitably cite
whenever they explain the nature of Tayap to anyone – when you talk to a man
56       3 Word classesyou say wetet (come), and when you talk to a woman you say wetak (come), using
gender-marked verbal affixes.
     This feature of the language never ceases to astonish any Sepik villager who
hears it, and people from other villages who listen to Gapuners explain that they
have “two languages” invariably react as though such a language is so bizarre as
to stretch the bounds of credulity (see Section 7.1.2; see also Sections 3.5 and 5.3
for gender marking on pronouns and verbal affixes).","[72, 73, 74, 75, 76]"
"3.1.4 Verbalized nounsNouns (like adjectives, see Section 3.3.2) can function as verbs, with the full range
of verbal morphology, with zero derivation.

NP – in this case a possessive NP. Verbalized nouns often carry an inchoative meaning.(3.27) ŋgu kapa weka numŋa noŋortakara
       ŋgu kapa wek             -a     num=ŋa

       ‘She’s really become a village woman’ (said of a woman who moved to

able to host realis/irrealis status and transitivity suffixes as well as subject and
object suffixes. A fully inflected verb can function as the sole word of a sentence.
    There are two major subclasses of verbs: intransitive and transitive. Examples
of each are:Intransitive verb(3-28) ŋgu pirok
       ŋgu     pirok
       3sg.f laugh.sg.f|1sg.pl.r

       1sg=erg.f 2sg see.r -s <2sg.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.s
       ‘I saw you’There are no ditransitive verbs in Tayap (see also Section 9.1). Semantically three-
place predicates express the recipient of giving, for example, with the benefactive
morpheme:(3-30) is        -iata        -n
       give.sbj -1sg.ben.r.o -sg|1pl.r
       ‘(you) give it to me!’However the recipient can be omitted, indicating that the verb in question is tran-
sitive, not ditransitive, and that the benefactive morpheme is an optional oblique
argument:(3-31) epi           i           -kru       -net
       tomorrow give.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s
       ‘I (m) will give it (to someone) tomorrow’Benefactive objects and regular objects cannot coocur in the same clause.
     As well as being divided into transitivity classes, every Tayap verb falls
into one of nine conjugation classes, based on how verbs form their non-future
forms: there are five classes for transitive verbs and four for intransitives (see
Chapter 6).
     Verb morphology in Tayap is entirely suffixing, with morphemes for object
and subject added – in that order, apart from discontinuous subject markers – to
verb stems. A characteristic feature of Tayap verbs is that status is marked across
the verb multiple times. The stem must occur in either an irrealis or realis form.
In addition, the object and subject morphemes that get suffixed to the stem also
encode realis/irrealis status.
     This can be illustrated with an example from the transitive verb stem o, which
means ‘strike’ (and covers actions like ‘shoot’, ‘stab’ and ‘hit’). Note how irrealis
vs. realis is marked across the verb (in bold):
                                                                                Verbs   65

           get up’)Status2marking on verbs, while mandatory, does not always occur in predictable
ways. Realis morphemes can occur as part of a verb that refers to an unreal event.
An example is the counterfactual mood (cf), which is a prototypical irrealis cate-
gory, because it refers to events that never occurred, such as ‘If he had seen it, he
would have shot it’. However in Tayap, on transitive verbs, the counterfactual is2 Note that the negative verb requires irrealis marking, see Section 5.4.2.1.

as counterfactual and suffixed by group I subject morphemes, which in this
grammar – for the sake of consistency with the pattern that is clear in transitive
verbs – are glossed as realis. In reality, though, group I subject morphemes are
the same in the realis and irrealis statuses (see Section 6.2.1).(3-35) memrɨknet

Tayap Text 5: Girls have an adventure in the rainforest
Narrated in 2009 bySpeaker A, 14 years old
Speaker B, 15 years old
Speaker C, 17 years oldThe narrative in Text 5 represents the end of the line for the Tayap language. It
was told by a fourteen- year old girl (speaker A), assisted by her friend (speaker
B) and her older sister (speaker C).
328         Tayap Texts     I knew all three of these girls well. I knew, therefore, that their passive com-
petence in Tayap was highly developed: the mother of the two sisters, and both
parents of speaker B, use a great deal of Tayap in day-to-day life, and all three girls
have no trouble understanding orders and following narratives in the language.
Despite this, the girls had little active competence in Tayap. The only things they
ever regularly uttered in Tayap were curse words like kwem petiek (wanker) or
ŋgwab (hole), which they delighted in hurling at each other and other children
numerous times during the course of a day.
     To spare the girls what I feared might be the embarrassment of trying to speak
in Tayap and failing, I had not considered asking them to try to narrate a story.
They, however, had other ideas.
     They knew that young women and men in their twenties regularly came up
into my house at night to tell stories in Tayap, and caught up in the excitement
of that, the three girls announced to me one afternoon that they, too, intended
to come and tell a story. And so they did. Each speaker told a short story, in the
collaborative and argumentative manner that characterizes the story below.
     The stories produced by these young speakers are a glimpse into the future of
Tayap. The Tayap spoken by these girls is what the language will look like at the
very end of its life, when verb classes have imploded, when inflections for person
and number are jumbled, and when Tayap’s vocabulary has been more or less
completely replaced with Tok Pisin.
     The speakers collectively make many of the errors discussed in the grammar,
including:
– overextension of the present progressive (lines 22, 26, 32–35, 45–46)
– inability to inflect class 2 and 3 verbs (lines 11–12, 31–36, 42, 61–65)
– semantic reduction of Tayap verbs on the model of Tok Pisin (lines 26–29)
– Tok Pisin verbs inflected with Tayap morphology (lines 11, 13, 23, 57)
– inability to correctly inflect verbs for subject (lines 13–15, 17, 21–22, 29, 35, 42, 61)
– loss of verbs of motion (lines 43–44)
– insecurity about the ergative (line 9)In addition to those grammatical errors, this story is told disfluently and incoher-
ently. In order to make any sense of it at all, I present, first, the same story told by
Speaker A in Tok Pisin.
     As I mentioned in my commentary on Tayap Text 4, I always asked young
speakers to re-tell in Tok Pisin what they had just narrated in Tayap, so that I
could be reasonably certain of what it is they had wanted to say in Tayap, even if
the forms they used were incorrect or incomprehensible.
     Here is fourteen-year-old speaker A’s narrative in Tok Pisin, followed by an
English translation. All the names in the narrative have been changed:

"7.1.2.1 Intransitive imperatives
The imperative forms of intransitive verbs are the single most salient grammati-
cal feature of Tayap, both for the speakers of Tayap and for everyone else in the
lower Sepik area who has ever heard of the language. Whenever Tayap speak-
ers talk about their vernacular, they merrily tell anyone who is willing to listen
that Tayap “is broken into a woman’s language and a man’s language” (“i bruk
long tok ples bilong ol meri na tok ples bilong ol man”). If you want to talk to a
woman, they explain patiently, you have to use the “women’s language” (“tok
ples bilong ol meri”). If you want to talk to a man, you have to use the “tok ples
bilong ol man”.
     Anyone who has followed this grammar this far knows that Tayap does indeed
have a number of gender-specific forms, such as the difference in first-person
forms for intransitive verbs inflected in the non-future tense (a male says ŋa mbot
‘I went’; a female says ŋa mbok; see Section 6.2). But this particular gendered
distinction is not primarily what the villagers have in mind when they talk about
how their language is broken in two.
     Instead, the villagers who describe Tayap in that way are referring to a single
feature of grammar, namely the different forms that the imperative of an intran-
sitive verb takes when it is addressed to a woman or to a man. The dramatic way
villagers describe this feature of their grammar, however – that you have to speak
to men and women using their specific “languages” – makes it seem as though
the entire Tayap language is “broken” in two.
     The villagers’ exegesis carries the unspoken implication that even parts of
speech like nouns have female and male forms, and that both those forms must
be mastered in order to be able to talk at all. Non-Gapuners who listen to Gapun
villagers describe Tayap in this way always react with understandable dismay,
and they inevitably shake their heads in wonder that a human language could
possibly be so complex. Some of them then go off and augment the complexity
                                                          Subjunctive (sbj)       203
further, informing others that, in fact, Tayap is “broken” into four languages: one
for women, one for men, one for girls and one for boys.
     Gapuners’ story about Tayap’s difference from other vernacular languages
must have arisen because no other language in the area marks gender on the
imperative forms of intransitive verbs. This is a salient feature of language
because whenever villagers from different places meet, one way many of them
enjoy spending time is to quiz one another on what one calls common objects –
‘betel nut’, ‘lime’ (for chewing betel nut), ‘tobacco’, ‘pig’, ‘dog’ and ‘sago jelly’
are the inevitable ones – in their respective vernaculars.
     Once these words have been exchanged, many people then go on to ask
about simple verbs: “How do you tell someone to come?”, they ask each other;
“How do you say ‘go’?”. Anyone asking a Tayap speaker that question will
receive the spiel about the vernacular being “broken in two” in response, and
so the story about the bizarreness of the little language that really is two – or is
it four? – separate languages gets perpetuated and spread throughout the lower
Sepik area.
     Despite the hype, however, the imperative form of an intransitive verb is
a simple construction. All it involves is (a) a verb stem inflected to express a
speaker’s wish that another person do something – in other words, a verb stem
inflected in the subjunctive mood – and (b) a subject ending that marks gender
and number. So the imperative for any intransitive verb is formed in the following
way (recall that 2nd person dual uses the plural form; see the discussion that
precedes example (3-73)):                                  +   -tet (2sg.m.r)
    subjunctive verb stem         +   -tak (2sg.f.r)
                                  +   -nkem (2pl.r|dl)The subjunctive stem of a verb is almost always the same as the form that verb
takes in the irrealis status. Examples are:(7-2) a. male            o-tet          muŋgo-tet         pruk-tet
         addressee       go.sbj-2sg.m.r stand.sbj-2sg.m.r work.sbj-2sg.m.r
                         ‘You go!’      ‘You stand!’      ‘You work!’      b. female          o-tak            muŋgo-tak            pruk-tak
         addressee       go.sbj-2sg.f.r   stand.sbj-2sg.f.r    work.sbj-2sg.f.r
                         ‘You go!’        ‘You stand!’         ‘You work!’
204        7 Mood      c. plural     o-nkem                 muŋgo-nkem           pruk-nkem
         addressees go.sbj-2pl.r           stand.sbj-2pl.r      work.sbj-2pl.r
                    ‘You all go!’          ‘You all stand!’     ‘You all work!’In all the examples above, the stem form of the verb in the subjunctive is identi-
cal to the stem form of those verbs in the irrealis status. There are exceptions to
this pattern (for intransitive verbs; transitive verbs have exceptions discussed in
7.1.2.2), however, such as the following, where the verbs have a subjunctive-spe-
cific form:(7-3) a. ai (irr) ‘come’ → we- (sbj, so: we-tet, we-tak, we-nkem; see example
         7-1 above)
      b. tutu (irr) ‘sit’ → tuto- (sbj, so: tuto-tet, tuto-tak, tuto-nkem)Verb roots ending in r gain the vowel e before the imperative ending, which is
also stressed:(7-4) a. rar (irr) ‘ look’ → raré- (sbj, so: raré-tet, raré-tak, raré-nkem)
      b. sir (irr) ‘descend’→ siré- (sbj, so: siré-tet, siré-tak, siré-nkem)If these exceptions only occurred in the imperative mood, it would be possible to
simply classify them as exceptions and maintain that the stem form of an imper-
ative verb is its irrealis form. However, the stem forms of verbs in the impera-
tive mood are also the forms that occur for verbs inflected to express an indirect
command (see below 7.1.4). This fact indicates that the underlying form for imper-
ative forms is a subjunctive wish – in other words, ‘You go!’ takes the grammatical
form of ‘(I want that) you go!’.
     For that reason, the stem forms of verbs inflected in the imperative are classi-
fied as subjunctive rather than irrealis, even though their realization in speech is
most often identical with the irrealis forms.","[222, 223, 224]"

         ‘they will eat pork’
Leaving aside everything else that is happening with this verb, look at the
verb stem. Note that the stem changes between the non-future tense, where it
appears as both ka (for 1sg, 2sg, 3sg.m and for 1pl subjects) and o (for 3sg.f
and 3pl subjects), and the future, where the stem is realized as a for every
subject.
     This being the case, how does one know whether the verb root of ‘eat’ is ka or
o or a, or something else entirely?
     This becomes clear when the verb is negated. Negation strips a verb of
everything but its irrealis stem and an irrealis object suffix (for transitive verbs),
or its irrealis stem and a marker of status (for intransitive verbs).

          ‘they won’t eat pork’Note that ‘didn’t eat’ (i.e. an event that did not occur in the past) and ‘won’t eat’
(an action that will not occur in the future) are expressed with the same form, a,
in Tayap. This is the reason this form is classified as irrealis: both the future and
the negated forms of verbs are unreal events. The actions they express have either
not yet happened (the future) or they have not happened or will not happen (the
negated forms).
    This invariant form of the verb stem in negation is a verb’s root form.
    Note that the negator wákare usually appears clause finally (but see e.g.
examples (8-27d and 9.14b)). This feature of Tayap is common to many Papuan
and Austronesian languages (Reesink 2002b).

      go.irr -irr negIn other words, ‘I didn’t go’, ‘they didn’t go’, ‘we won’t go’, ‘she will not go’, etc. –
all this becomes okɨ wákare.
     As in transitive verbs, the form of the verb that appears in negation is the verb
root.
     An intransitive verb takes no object suffix. In negation, however, intransitive
verbs exhibit a morphological structure that parallels the transitive object suffix.
A negated intransitive verb signals irrealis status in both the verb stem and in the
suffix that follows it. This irrealis suffix suffixed to the verb stem further marks it as
irrealis.
     The irrealis suffix suffixed to the verb stem is the same for all subjects, regard-
less of person, gender or number. Note that it occurs in contexts apart from just
negation, see for example (5-9a).
     The suffix occurs in one of three forms: -ki, -kɨ or -ku. There is some phonetic
regularity in the patterning of which verb stems take which suffixes: verb stems
that contain or end in front vowels tend to take -ki or -kɨ, and verb stems that
                           Standard negation in transitive and intransitive verbs     143
contain or end in back vowels tend to take -ku. All the verbs that take -ki are verbs
of motion or end in the same stem form as the verb ai ‘come’. But like much else
in Tayap, none of this is entirely predictable. All verbs suffixed by irrealis -ki, for
example, may be verbs of motion or verbs that end with -ai. But not all verbs of
motion take -ki. And there are many exceptions to the front vowel/back vowel
pattern.","[158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163]"
"A fragmentary word list of the Gapún language of New GuineaIn August-September 1937, when I was spending some time with the missionary
P. Josef Much, S.V.D., in the village of Wátam, the first coastal village South of
the Sepik outlet in New Guinea, in order to collect ethnographic and anthropo-
graphic observations, we also had the opportunity to go on a day trip to the village
of Gapún. On 6 September, we first travelled in a dugout canoe across the big
Wátam lagoon from Wátam to the village of Wánggan (approximately three hours
travelling time). Wánggan shares the same language as the villages of Kópar and
Síngrin located at the lower Sepik river, a language completely different to the
Wátam language. The next morning (7 Sept.), we crossed the lagoon towards the

"3.1.3.3 Non-particular nouns
Nouns that otherwise could be expected to be masculine can be feminine under
two circumstances.
     The first is when the subject or referent of a verb is a general class of people
rather than a named or known individual. For example, the following utterance
is from a harangue by an older Tayap speaker who is chastising younger vil-
lagers for behaving badly. In the course of his harangue, the speaker wonders
rhetorically which big man (i.e. which old, knowledgeable man) is still alive to
teach young people about the good ways of the past. (The answer, he knows,
is ‘none’.)
     His question was phrased as follows:(3-22) Ani munje suman wuk?
       who man      big      be.3sg.f.r
       ‘Which big man is here (i.e. still living)?’Note that the verb ‘be’ is inflected in 3sg.f, even though the referent is unambig-
uously a male. The use of the feminine form here conveys generality. It refers to
the category or class of ‘big men’ rather than to a specific big man. If the speaker
had phrased the question using the 3sg.m form of ‘be’, kut, the question would
be referring to a specific named or known big man: ‘Which one of the big men we
all know is present here right now?’
     Another example of the same phenomenon is the following (feminine forms
that denote the male referent are in bold):
                                                                    Nouns        61

       ‘The man is of course finding his strength and doing it on his own,
       nobody else is telling him to’This utterance was spoken during a tense discussion about the incessant and dis-
ruptive drinking in the village that, by late 2009, had been plaguing Gapun for
some time. During a village-wide meeting, the mother of a fifteen-year-old boy
shouted angrily that her husband never tried to stop their son from drinking.
     In response, a man in his late thirties made the comment above, which is
dismissive of the mother and supports the young man’s father by implying that
it wouldn’t matter what the father told his son. The son, this man is saying, is old
enough and would act according to his own desires anyway: no one is ordering
him to drink; he does it because he wants to. But as in the previous example,
(3-22), this utterance refers to a male using feminine grammatical forms.
     The rhetorical effect is the same: the speaker’s use of feminine grammatical
forms when talking about a male conveys a meaning of generality. The speaker
is not overtly disputing anything the mother says about her son or her husband,
these grammatical forms say; he is making a general observation.
     A non-literal but semantically more accurate translation of the man’s remark
would be: ‘As young men get older and stronger of course they decide on their own
what they want to do, they don’t do things just because other people tell them to’.","[80, 81]"

9.3.2 Coordination with -api ‘afterward’ (aft)The suffix -api links clauses that encode actions that occur consecutively, one
after the other. It is affixed to a verb that is fully inflected for person, number and
TAM and takes its own arguments. The suffix marks that verb as an action that
was or will be completed before the action in the clause that follows it occurred
or will occur.
    Like -a, -api can link clauses that involve either the same subject or different
subjects. Again, it joins full independent clauses.
    Examples are:(9-12) a. ŋa tuwkunetapi aikinet yure
          ŋa tuw         -ku -net            -api
          1sg wash.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr -aft            ai           -ki    -net                 yu =re

           ‘after they fought, the moon rose’9.3.3 Coordination with ŋgɨ(na)napi ‘therefore’, ‘for that reason’Some speakers pronounce this form ŋgu(na)napi, which indicates that it might be
analyzed as ŋgu (3sg.f)+ the coordinating suffix -api. So: ‘after it’.
    Ŋgɨnanapi (or ŋgɨnapi) is a freestanding word. It introduces a clause that
expresses cause or reason, thereby combining two main clauses:(9-13) a. ŋgɨgi Kama ŋgarkwanŋguk ŋgarkwanŋguk, ŋgɨnapi ŋgu wek
          ŋgɨ =gi        Kama ŋgar         -kwan         -ŋguk

            -irr neg
            ‘Yesterday a sore appeared [on his leg] and therefore he didn’t walk’9.3.4 Coordination with ayáta ‘although’, ‘it doesn’t matter that’, ‘never
      mind that’Ayáta is a word most familiar to the villagers as an interjection of impatience or
dismissal, in its meaning of ‘Stop it! or ‘Never mind’ (see Section 3.10). It is this
latter sense of dismissal that is expressed when the word is used in a sentence as
a clause-coordinating conjunction.(9-14) a. ayáta ŋɨ munje suman, nime ŋa namŋgarke
          ayáta       ŋɨ       munje suman nime         ŋa nam           -garke

scope covers both ‘go’ and ‘see’ verbs, which are both in their negative stripped
down form.        b. ayáta ŋɨ aikinana waraknet, ŋa wákare inda okɨ rarŋrɨ
           ayáta      ŋɨ     ai         -ki   -nana     warak -net

            ‘Even though they didn’t come, we’ll make food’Sentences with ayáta can also occur in construction with the verb in the clause
that follows ayáta in the prohibitive mood. For example:(9-15) a. ayáta tukur aiŋgarke, yim okɨtikenana
          ayáta     tukur ai            -ŋgarke yim o -kɨ -tike

            come.irr-irr-3pl.irr-intent dx
            ‘Even if night comes quickly, they’re going to come’9.4 Adverbial subordinate clauses9.4.1 Adverbial subordination with -re ‘when’, ‘if’, ‘while’ (sub)The suffix -re (realized as -de after n) attaches as a suffix to fully inflected verbs
and marks a verb as expressing the background condition in relation to which the
action indicated in the main clause occurs. This backgrounding nature of sub-
ordination is emphasized by the order of the subordinate and main clauses in
Tayap: the subordinate clause always precedes the main clause.
     In English, these are clauses that would be expressed with the subordinating
conjunctions ‘if’ and ‘when’. Unlike English, though, Tayap makes no distinc-
tion between ‘if’ and ‘when’, at least when referring to unreal events; both are
expressed by -re.
     These clauses are semantically subordinate in that they specify a precondi-
tion for the action of the main clause to occur. They are not considered medial-
final (cosubordinate) constructions, as the non-final verbs are structurally quite
different, for instance they are not obligatorily irrealis (Section 9.8).

    Examples are as follows:(9-16) a. ŋa aŋgok akrunetre, kambwan ambukrunet

           ‘when he said that bad thing to me, I (m) became ashamed’When verbs in both subordinate and main clauses are constructed in the progres-
sive (see Section 8.3.1) the meaning of -re is ‘while’ and the actions indicated by
the verbs occur simultaneously, not sequentially.(9-17) a. ŋa prukakkutre, ŋɨ pororakut

      ndɨ (hypo)Counterfactual events are expressed by a main clause (‘I would have killed the
snake’) and a subordinate clause (‘if I had seen it in time’). As discussed in the fol-
lowing section, Section 9.4.3, counterfactual constructions, in addition to being
formed with a particular inflectional morphology, also obligatorily take a particle
that can be glossed as ‘hypothetical’.
    This particle, which can be either pi, pime or ndɨ marks the clause in which it
appears as the subordinate clause. These particles all have their own stress.
    Like the previous clauses, these clauses are semantically subordinate.
    For example:(9-19) a. pipiŋgabu aŋgwar pime, oŋgab wawarwekrɨknukun

             ‘If he hadn’t gotten a pain, he would have worked sago’Unlike the clause-linking constituents -a, -api and -re, the hypothetical particles
pi, pime and ndɨ are not bound morphemes. They are free morphemes that tend to
be clause final, as the following examples show:(9-20) a. Mbanuŋ ewar awknet pi, wakŋgɨn

              ‘If you were young, I would marry you’When appearing with a verb inflected in the intentional mood (see Sections 5.4.2.3
and Section 7.4), pi (or ndɨ, which is also sometimes used in this context) means ‘If
X want(s) to do Y…’. For example:(9-21) a. Kiki Potowre atɨkɨnana pi, namku wetak

that highlights the noun phrase that it follows in ongoing talk (see Section 3.11.2).
However, when it occurs in a clause with a verb inflected in counterfactual mood,
ndɨ conveys a hypothetical meaning.
    Ndɨ is also the particle that usually follows the negation wákare in a negative
counterfactual sentence, for example:(9-23) ewar tukur aiki wákare ndɨ yim patɨr andɨkrɨkkun
       ewar       tukur ai             -ki   wákare ndɨ

       ‘If it hadn’t rained yesterday, we would have roofed the house’9.4.3 Counterfactual (cf)The counterfactual expresses an action or event that could have happened but
did not or cannot happen, as in ‘If he had gone hunting yesterday, he would have
speared a cassowary’, or ‘If you had been young, I would marry you’. Some of
the ways of constructing the counterfactual have become moribund in Tayap.
There are a number of morphologically rather complex subtypes. The counterfac-
tual has the largest degree of variation documented for any verb form in Tayap.
Already in the 1980s, I was told by senior men that a clause like ‘would have
gone’ could be expressed as wakret, waknet, wakrɨknet or wakrɨkret, and that all
of those verbs meant exactly the same thing.
     By 2009, the oldest fluent speakers were constructing counterfactual sen-
tences differently from what I had recorded in the 1980s. Those oldest speakers

were still able to produce counterfactual morphology, but they only inflected
one of the verbs in a counterfactual construction consisting of two clauses. Most
speakers under fifty, however, could not do even this. Those speakers constructed
counterfactual sentences without using any counterfactual morphology.
    And even relatively fluent Tayap speakers younger than forty have stopped
using Tayap in the main clause of a counterfactual construction.
    Senior men in the 1980s expressed the counterfactual as follows:             if-clause                                            then-clause
verb inflected with counterfactual                     verb inflected with counterfactual
morphology + hypothetical particle                                 morphology
          pi, pime or ndɨ
Example:(9-24) njenum Mbowdirekɨ muŋgit wakndak pi, ŋgɨ ŋgat non wakŋgro
       njenum Mbowdi =rekɨ muŋgit wak1            -ndak      pi,

         ‘If the dogs had gone with Mbowdi the other day, they would have speared
         a cassowary’By 2009, the oldest fluent speakers were expressing counterfactuality by nominal-
izing the verb in the if-clause with the non-finite suffix -(ŋ)gar (see Section 4.2):             if-clause                                            then-clause
 irr verb stem affixed with -ŋgar +                    verb inflected with counterfactual

       Mairum =yi     ŋa =nana sokoi        mokɨr     i      -ŋgar pime
       Mairum =erg.f 1sg =dat tobacco seedling give.irr -nfn.sg hypo1 Note that the counterfactual form of okɨ (‘go’) is exceptional. See Section 9.4.3.1.

       ‘If Mairum had given me a tobacco seedling, I would have planted it’ (lit.
       ‘Mairum hypothetically a giver of a tobacco seedling, I would have planted it’)Counterfactual morphology is still used in the example above, but unlike the
senior men in the 1980s, the oldest speakers of Tayap in 2009 only used it for the
verb of the then-clause. In this case, the counterfactual meaning of the if-clause
is borne by the hypothetical particle pi, pime or ndɨ, not by verb morphology.
Constructing a counterfactual sentence like this was a possibility earlier, and I
have a few recorded examples of this form from the 1980s. But they are rare. The
overwhelming majority of the examples I recorded in the 1980s inflected the verbs
in both the if-clause and the then-clause with the counterfactual morphology.
    Counterfactual morphology is completely absent in the language of fluent
speakers between the ages of forty and fifty-five in 2009. They consistently
express counterfactuality without using any counterfactual morphology at all:                 if-clause                                  then-clause
irr verb stem affixed with -ŋgar for all sub-       verb inflected in future tense

      ‘If they had seen Mbanaŋ, they would have chased him’ (lit. ‘Those
      hypothetically who are see-ers of Mbanaŋ, they will chase him’)This trend continues in the speech of speakers in their early forties and younger.
On the few occasions when these speakers formulate a counterfactual statement,
the entire then-clause is in Tok Pisin, not Tayap:               if-clause                                   then-clause

       (lit. ‘Me myself hypothetically present, you get big damage in the
       morning’; i.e. I would have beaten you up)It is possible that the counterfactual has been on its way out of Tayap for quite
some time. That, at any rate, may be one explanation for the fact that already in
the 1980s it exhibited the widest variation of any verbal morphology.
     Another explanation could be that the various forms, even if they had the
same literal meaning, had different stylistic nuances. If so, those nuances had
already been lost even in the speech of senior men in the 1980s.","[276, 277, 278, 279, 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, 285]"
"6.1.1 Class 1: Verb stems that alternate between p and ØVerbs in this class consist of roots that contain the vowels o, e, i and u – in other
words, every vowel except a and ɨ. Verb roots frequently contain several of those
vowels, and it is not predictable which of the vowels will appear with the p.
     In the realis stem, one of the above vowels in the root appears with a p. In the
irrealis, the p and the vowel that follows it does not appear. An example of a class
1 verb is ‘strike’, which has already been mentioned above (6-1a and b).
     In the presentation that follows, the non-future forms are given first as exam-
ples of the realis stem, and they are followed by future forms of the same verb
as examples of the irrealis stem, in order to clearly illustrate the contrasts that
define the different verb classes.(6-6) a. o ‘strike’ (realis)

ble to predict which vowel in a verb stem will be preceded by a p in the realis form.
      In the dictionary, verbs are listed under their root forms; that is, in the barest
irrealis forms they take when they are negated. A verb like ‘strike’, therefore, is
listed under o, along with an entry defining it as a class 1 transitive verb. That
‘class 1’ means that the verb listed, in its realis form, has a p either preceding it, or
following it (this position is specified in the entry). If the p appears in the middle
of the stem, this is indicated by parentheses. For example, the root form of ‘ask’
is written kotar-(p)-e.
      Note that this convention is used for citing verbs as lexemes in citation form;
it is not used in the example sentences.","[188, 189, 190]"

8.3.1 ProgressivesThe progressive marks events that are occurring either at the moment of speaking
(as in ‘I am eating a sago pancake’) or as a backdrop to another action in narra-
tion (for example ‘he was eating a sago pancake when they arrived’ or ‘she will be
cooking when they come’). It can also express a recurring event or action, as in ‘I
used to see Sopak in Wongan, but now I don’t anymore’.
     The progressive is a complex predicate. It consists of two separate verb stems:
an irrealis verb stem + linker (in the case of intransitives) + the verb ‘be’, which is
inflected for person, number, TAM and status.48.3.1.1 Intransitive progressive
The progressive aspect for the majority of intransitive verbs is formed as follows:5

realized as uke.

          ‘we are fighting’The progressive morpheme -rɨk has the same form as the counterfactual mor-
pheme (see Section 9.4.3). The counterfactual morpheme, however, is always
stressed, whereas the progressive -rɨk is always unstressed.
     Progressive verbs formed with -rɨk also have a different stress pattern from
progressive verbs formed with -ak. Verbs with -ak take stress on the final syllable
of the verb stem. Progressive verbs formed with -rɨk or -ruk take stress on the final
syllable of the inflected verb.
     Temporality on progressive verbs is expressed by the fully inflected final verb
‘be’. Thus, a future progressive is formed as follows:(8-26) ŋgɨ pororakakundak
       ŋgɨ poror        -ak   akundak

8.3.1.2 Transitive progressive
The progressive aspect for transitive verbs is formed in the same manner as for
intransitive verbs, except that in the place of the progressive morpheme, a bene-
factive object morpheme appears. The pattern is as follows:                      irrealis verb stem
                               +
                      benefactive object
                               +
      verb ‘be’, inflected for TAM, status and subjectBenefactive object morphemes are a distinct set of object morphemes that nor-
mally foreground possession or the fact that the action expressed by the verb
impacts on a particular entity. They are discussed in Section 7.5.
    In the progressive, these morphemes always occur with a final n. They encode
the features of the transitive object, and have none of the associations with pos-
session or that the verb impacts particularly upon the entity. Their forms are:
     Singular      Dual     Plural

speakers of Tayap, and they are over-extended to express temporal relation-
ships that more correctly would be expressed by the non-future tense. As
was discussed in Chapter 6, the non-future forms of Tayap verbs are irregular
and complicated to construct. In comparison, the progressive is easy: all one
needs to know in order to form it is the following:
(1) the irrealis verb stem (which doesn’t change for speaker or referent);
(2) the object (which will frequently be -kwan, the 3sg.f.ben.o form); and
(3) the correct form of the verb ‘be’, which would be heard hundreds of times
    every day in the village.","[262, 263, 264, 265, 266]"
"9.4.3.1 How to form a counterfactual verb
Counterfactual morphology is quite specific. Intransitive verbs use their irrealis
stems, and transitive verbs their realis stems.
     The actual stem form of many intransitive verbs is the same as their irrealis
form. But other verb stems have suppletive forms. They change in regular ways,
but most of the forms occur nowhere else in Tayap (an exception is the counter-
factual form for o ‘go’, which is the same as that verb’s habitual stem, see Section
8.3.2). The changes to the verb stems are as follows:    class 1 & class 2 verb stems that contain e → wek
    class 1 & class 2 verb stems that contain o → wak
    class 1 & class 2 verb stems that contain i → ik
    class 3 verb stems, a → akexceptions:     (1) the verb ‘be’, a-, becomes awk in cf
                (2) the verb ‘marry’, ar-, remains the same and does not change
                    to ak in cfThe following is a full list of how counterfactual intransitive verbs are formed.

Note that the counterfactual -rɨk is always stressed, in which point it differs from
the formally identical progressive marker also -rɨk (see Section 8.3.1.1).
     The counterfactual affix -rɨk is optional in those cases where the form of
the verb stem in the counterfactual differs from its form in the irrealis. So, for
example, a verb like ‘be’ is realized as a in its irrealis form, but in the counter-
factual, it becomes awk. This partially suppletive stem change makes the coun-
terfactual morpheme -rɨk redundant. Therefore, it can be omitted. But it doesn’t
have to be omitted.
     The phrase ‘she would have been’ can thus be expressed in any of the follow-
ing four ways:      awk-rɨk-rak
      awk-rɨk-tak
      awk-rak
      awk-takTransitive verbs display a similar range of variation. They can be formed in ways
that either include or exclude the following morphemes in parentheses. Note the
realis forms of the subject and object affixes:

                                6.1.6)So a verb like ‘I would have eaten it’ has the following forms, all of which senior
speakers insist mean the same:2verb stem.cf + (-rɨk) + (-nv/-tv)           + object.r + subject.r
     ak-       -rɨk       -nu-                 <ku>        -n             →     akrɨknukun2
     ak-       -rɨk                             -ku        -n             →      akrɨkkun
     ak-                  -nu-                 <ku>        -n             →      aknukun
     ak-                                        -ku        -n             →        akkunAs with intransitive verbs, all these options for variation only apply to verbs that
alter their stems in the counterfactual. They don’t apply to a verb like moser
‘buy’, for example, because that verb has the same stem form in both the irrealis
and the counterfactual (since moser isn’t a class 1, 2 or 3 verb; see the discussion
above about which verbs change their stem form in the counterfactual).3 In this
case, where the stem does not change to express the counterfactual, the coun-
terfactual morpheme -rɨk is needed – even if the -nv/-tv subject morphemes are
optional.
     So the full range of inflectional options listed above applies to verbs like o
‘hit’ or wawar-(p/w)-e ‘hang up’, because to express counterfactuality, those verb
stems change and become wak and wawarwek respectively. In those instances,
once again, the counterfactual affix -rɨk is redundant, since the stem change
already signals counterfactuality.
     Negative counterfactual actions are expressed by simply negating the rele-
vant subordinate verb as in a main clause, and following this with one of the
hypothetical particles (most commonly ndɨ), then expressing the main clause in
the counterfactual as usual:
2 In the morphological combination -rɨknukun, the morpheme-medial n and u undergo metath-
esis, resulting in [ɾɵkunkun]
3 To lessen the risk for confusion, the verb stem of such verbs is glossed as cf in counterfactual
constructions, even though the stem is identical with its irr form. An example is (9-23).

reference of an NP by specifying the role of the referent of that NP in the situation
described by the [relative clause]” (Andrews 2007: 206). Relative clauses in Tayap
are nominalized, marked with the inanimate possessive clitic =ŋa(n) which
appears on the verb of the relative clause. This possessive clitic =ŋa(n) is added
to a fully inflected verb, which then functions as a subordinate relative clause.
The common argument or head (“domain nominal” in Andrews’ 2007 terms) of
a relative and a main clause can be in S, A, O or oblique function in the relative
clause and in the main clause.
     Tayap relative clauses are external. The relative clause generally directly
follows the common argument in the main clause. This is the position held by a
nominal modifier (e.g. adjective) as well (see Chapter 4).
     The common argument may also be expressed with a deictic (Section 3.8)
functioning resumptively with respect to the head noun, and typically following
the common argument directly: for example, consider (9-29a-b). In both examples
there are two resumptive pronouns, in (9-29a) following the relative clause and as
the final part of the main clause and in (9-29b) following the common argument
and as the final part of the main clause. Note that these resumptive pronouns agree
in gender and number with the common argument. They are not an obligatory part
of relative clauses: see for example (9-29c) and (9-29f), which do not have them.
     Note that the verb of the relative clause is fully inflected, and the relative
clause contains all the usual components of a clause. The relative clause may
                                                          Relative clauses     269
even contain a complex predicate: see for example (9-29f) which has a relative
clause with a serial verb construction involving kv ‘bring’ in construction with a
verb (see Section 8.2.3.1).
     Relative clauses would appear to always be restrictive. No non-restrictive rel-
ative clauses have been found in the data. In the following example the posses-
sive marker is in bold and the head noun in the main clause underlined.(9-29) a. nɨm puŋgokawukŋan aŋgi kopi aŋgi

            ‘I don’t know where they got the one they killed later from’
            Ie, ‘the one they struck later, I don’t know where they got it from’Relative clauses are not very common and the corpus contains few examples to
show whether the common argument is syntactically a part of the relative clause
or part of the main clause. However the main clause of (9-29d) can be negated
using wákare before munje (and changing the verb kiraw to kirawŋgrɨ). This sug-
gests that munje belongs syntactically in the relative clause rather than the main
clause. However more examples are needed to be certain.
    Tayap used to have another relativizing suffix: the morpheme -gin (or perhaps
it was a clitic =gin, there is not enough evidence to show). This morpheme seems
to be synonymous with, and occurs in exactly the same morphological slot as,
=ŋa(n). For example:(9-30) patɨr aŋgu ŋaŋan omoŋi perkungin otɨtekara

sions that I recorded in the 1980s. By 2009, however, it was no longer used by
anybody. 49.6 Finite nominalizations with consequence clitic =ŋa(n)Finite nominalizations are constructed, like relative clauses, with the possessive
clitic, and carry the meaning of consequence; that a particular state has been
brought into existence because of an action. For example:(9-31)   kokɨr mbɨdtia ŋaŋan noŋor kokɨr kratianŋa

         break.r -s <1sg.ben.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s =poss
         ‘my head hurts because my wife hit me on the head’9.7 Perception constructionsSentences that describe an act of perceiving, like seeing or smelling, can be
expressed in two ways in Tayap: either paratactically as two separate clauses, or
with a nominalized construction.
     In the perception construction, the perceiver is subject of the main clause,
and the person or thing perceived is object. In the subordinate (nominalized)
clause, always placed after the main clause, the action expressing the circum-
stances of the perception is indicated. Coreferential with the main clause object
is the thing perceived, which may be subject or object in the subordinate clause.
     The two possibilities are exemplified below:

uses the form ‘woman (SG) two’ rather than the dual form naŋaw or the plural naŋro, and the
object agreement is plural rather than dual. These two examples were from an elicitation session
and the inconsistency was noticed too late to be queried directly.
                                                  Perception constructions      273
One argument, the subject or the object of the main clause, is coreferent with
either the subject or object of the nominalized clause. The verb of the nominal-
ized clause is fully inflected. These clauses, while marked with the possessive
clitic (as relative clauses are), are structurally different from relative clauses.
     Relative clauses modify NPs, and they occur in the modifier slot within an NP.
These nominalized clauses, on the contrary, while they share an argument with
their main clause, do not modify an NP but rather modify an entire main clause,
within the specific semantic domain of perception. The shared argument of the
clauses is expressed only once, in the main clause, while the nominalized clause
consists only of the nominalized predicate and any arguments.
     These are not complement clauses either, as the nominalized clause does not
function as an argument of the main clause, but rather as a modifier. This can
clearly be seen for example in (9-32b), in which it can’t be the case that the nomi-
nalized clause is functioning as an argument of the main clause. The main clause
verb has 3pl object marking, so the object must be the women, not the clause
describing them going into the forest.
     Other potential candidates for complement clauses, including constructions
of saying and telling, are expressed with verbal morphology involving indirect
commands (see Section 7.1.4).

            house =all go_inside.3sg.f|1pl.r           =poss
            ‘I saw her going inside the house’In (9-34a) the main clause is Sopakyi Nik tatŋgɨn ‘Sopak saw Nik’, and the subor-
dinate perception clause mbor pokunŋa ‘[Nik] spearing the pig’. Thus the clause
structure as a whole is ‘Sopak saw Nik [spearing the pig]’. The clause is not mod-
ifying Nik, as it would be in a relative clause, but rather the perception clause
predicates what is perceived.
274        9 Simple and complex sentences     In negative perception clauses like ‘I didn’t see X doing Y’, the perception
verb is negated and the verb that expresses the perceived action is inflected in its

          ‘I didn’t know you (m) had come’9.8 Cosubordinate constructionsA further type of clause combining construction in Tayap consists of medial verbs
appearing with modifying suffixes and then linked to independent final verbs,
which are always verbs of motion. These are cosubordinate constructions, also
called clause chaining constructions: the terms are used interchangeably here.
     In these clauses, a medial verb appears in its irrealis or realis stem form,
without a subject marker, with an object marker if transitive, and one of three
linking suffixes: -ra (modifier), -kar (manner), or -rar (multiple), followed by an
independent verb. These structures form medial-final chains (Longacre 2007).
Van Valin and La Polla (1997) call this type of clause linkage cosubordination, i.e.
dependency without embedding.
     Nothing can occur between the medial verb and the final verb. Also such
clauses cannot contain cataphoric pronominal reference (i.e. cannot refer forward
to something in a later clause). So medial chains are not subordinate, but neither
are they coordinate as their medial verbs are dependent on the final verb of the
chain for status marking.
                                                       Cosubordinate constructions          275
     In all three types of clause chains, negation occurs once and has scope over
the whole construction.
     Tayap cosubordinate constructions differ from serial verb constructions in
that medial verbs have an obligatory linking suffix, whereas non-final verbs in
serial verb constructions do not, and serial verb constructions generally form
a single phonological word whereas cosubordinate constructions do not (see
Section 8.2 for discussion of serial verb constructions).
     One unusual facet of Tayap’s medial-final constructions is that they do not
typically form the long chains that Papuan languages in general are so famous
for. The majority of medial-final chains in Tayap consist of a single medial verb
followed by a final verb. This might be in part because the final verb has to be a
verb of motion.
     An alternative analysis of these constructions, in particular -r and -kar, is that
they are adverbial suffixes, rendering an adverb from a verb. However a cosubor-
dinate analysis is preferred here as negation operates across clause boundaries
to cover the whole construction rather than negating the putative adverb directly
(see below, Section 9.8.2).","[285, 286, 287, 288, 289, 290, 291, 292, 293, 294, 295]"
"Immediately after they finished telling their story in Tayap, I always asked young
speakers to re-tell the story in Tok Pisin. I did this for two reasons. First, I did
it in order to compare the fluency and complexity of the narratives – in order
324           Tayap Textsto check, for example, whether a speaker told a brief, simple narrative in Tayap
because she or he was someone whose narrative style was brief and simple in any
language, or whether a brief and simple story in Tayap was an artefact of limited
active competence in the language.
    The second reason I elicited the same story in Tok Pisin was to be able to
make educated guesses about what a speaker had attempted to say in Tayap in
those instances where the forms she or he used were far from the grammatically
correct ones.
    Here is the story this speaker told immediately after he concluded his Tayap
narrative:      Yumi go long bus. Yumi go long bus nau apinun wantaim tudak i godaun. Tudak i godaun
      nau, Pita, Waiki. Em Konjab taitim han bilong em ia na em i tok, ”Yu kam. Traim paitim bros

"3.6 Quantifiers3.6.1 CountingThe traditional counting system in Tayap was based on a person’s fingers and
toes. This is a well-known areal feature (Laycock 1975). The Tayap system allowed
counting up to twenty, although in principle the system could count indefinitely,
because after reaching twenty, one could, I was told, begin counting again on the
body of another person (so ‘twenty-one’ could be ‘two hands and two legs and
one hand one finger on the other side’).
     This laborious system, for which there seems to have been no shorthand, dis-
appeared rapidly after villagers began speaking Tok Pisin among themselves in
the 1930s and 1940s. Today it is only vaguely remembered, and is regarded as an
amusing, cumbersome and primitive curiosity by everyone in Gapun.
     Villagers still use the Tayap words for ‘one’ through to ‘five’, and they some-
times combine them to denote a number between five and ten. For example, I
once overheard a villager ask another in Tayap how many bags a cocoa buyer who
had come to Gapun had filled (this was a typical instance of using Tayap to “hide
talk” from non-villagers). The addressee, a thirty-year-old man who is a very weak
speaker of Tayap and who under other circumstances never speaks it, responded
by saying manaw towotowo (literally ‘three four’), which in this context meant
seven bags.
     Villagers also sometimes use the Tayap word for ‘ten’, but never any of the
others, which are always said in Tok Pisin.
     The traditional system, as I recorded it from senior men in the 1980s, is as
follows:    nambar                              ‘one’
    sene                                ‘two’
    manaw                               ‘three’

modifiers can occur in any order; see Section 4.1.1). So:3(3-75) naŋaw moprɨ sene

adverbial numerals (‘twice’, ‘thrice’, ‘four times’, etc.), Tayap uses a construction in3 senea is sene (‘two’) with the conjunction -a; so ‘two-and’

which the number is the main verb and the event that happens a number of times is
nominalized by suffixing the irrealis verb stem with the non-finite suffix -(ŋ)gar (see

forms are the closed class of nouns denoting some humans, and pigs and dogs. All
other nouns have only one form. To indicate plurality in those nouns, the following
quantifiers may be used. They immediately follow the noun to which they refer:
    samb     general marker of plurality, most often used with countable
             nouns
    non samb used with unquantifiable masses like water or food
    sami     ‘many’, ‘lots of’, ‘plenty’
    -ŋgro    used to signify associative plurality on people or place names,
             pronouns and interrogative words

there is a handful of adjectives that have separate dual and/or plural forms. Further,
Tayap has a marker that attached to adjectives to signify ‘more than one’. This plural
marker (anem) is moribund; these days it is heard in the speech only of speakers over
sixty. From one of those speakers, I elicited sentences such as the following:(3-78) a. numbwan eŋgon anem munjenum
          numbwan eŋgon anem            munjenum
          thought    good poss.pl man.pl
          ‘men with good thoughts’ (lit. ‘good thoughts men’)        b. rew suman anem munjenum
           rew suman anem             munjenum
           fear big        poss.pl man.pl
           ‘cowards’ (lit. ‘big fears men’)In naturally occurring speech of older speakers, this marker of plurality was used
most productively in the context of abuse. Indeed, I was first alerted to it when
transcribing the many “kros-es” (loud public arguments, almost always started
and sustained by women) that occurred in the village (Kulick 1993). There, anem
(shortened to nem after the vowel in the preceding word) occurs in abusive
phrases like the following:(3-79) a. iminkato sawirŋa nem!
          iminkato          sawir =ŋa nem
          lower_intestine black =poss adj.pl
          ‘black assholes!’        b. man sumanŋa nem!
           man suman =ŋa      nem
           cunt big     =poss adj.pl
           ‘big cunts!’The retraction of what may have been a much more widely used marker of plural-
ity to the context of vituperative abuse is an instructive instance of how particular
registers of language (such as abuse) can be repositories of older, obsolescent
forms that for various reasons have all but died out in the language otherwise.
92       3 Word classes3.7 ArticlesTayap has no definite article. The definiteness of a referent emerges either through
the context or because it occurs together with a deictic word.
     The language does, however, have a word, non, which means ‘a’ or ‘some’ –
in the sense of ‘some man’ or ‘some child’ – and which can function as an indefi-
nite article. The word does not mean ‘one’: to specify a singularity, the quantifier
nambar ‘one’ is used (see Section 3.6.1). The word non can occur independently,
as in the following request, which is heard ubiquitously in Gapun, uttered by
someone asking someone else for betel nut:(3-80) non kukukwe
       non     ku     -ku            -we
       indef bring -3sg.f.r.o        -come.sbj
       ‘give me one/some’ (lit. ‘bring me one/some’)When non occurs after a noun, it imparts indefiniteness. If non does not occur,
the referent will likely be interpreted as definite. An example is a sentence like
the following:(3-81) rorŋi ŋgat tanŋgɨn
       ror    =ŋi       ŋgat   ta    -n -ŋgɨ        -n
       child = erg.m cassowary see.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.sThis sentence would likely be interpreted to mean ‘the child saw the cassowary’,
but it can mean both ‘the child saw the cassowary’ and ‘the child saw a casso-
wary’. The context of the utterance would usually make it clear if a definite or
indefinite noun were meant.
    If a speaker wanted to emphasize indefiniteness, he or she could use non or
non samb (Section 3.6.2) after the nominal it modifies:(3-82) a. rorŋi ŋgat non tanŋgɨn
          ror    =ŋi      ŋgat      non ta   -n -ŋgɨ        -n
          child =erg.m cassowary indef see.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘the boy saw a cassowary’       b. ror nonŋi ŋgat non tanŋgɨn
          ror    non     =ŋi      ŋgat non
          child indef =erg.m cassowary indef

              ‘some (unnamed and possibly unknown) boy saw a cassowary’3.8 Deictics (dx)Deictics in Tayap locate a referent in space and time, and can be translated as
‘this’ or ‘that’ and ‘here’ or ‘there’. The language has a word ai for ‘here, and anɨnɨ
for ‘there’. These words are used in simple commands to put something or bring
something ‘here’ or ‘there’:(3-83) a. ainnɨ wo ŋgritukun
          ai      =nɨ    wo    ŋgri -tu -ku       -n
          here =loc on_top put.irr -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
          ‘put it here on top’         b. anɨnɨ wo ŋgritukun
            anɨnɨ wo          ŋgri -tu -ku      -n
            there on_top put.irr -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
            ‘put it there on top’
              Note: the locative clitic =nɨ on anɨnɨ is optional and frequently omitted (as it is in
              this example) probably because the word ends with nɨ, which is homophonous
              with the locative clitic.","[107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113]"

affirmation or disagreement, as well as affective involvement with, or phatic
acknowledgement of, other people. These interjections form an utterance by
themselves:ore             ‘Yes’. This is a Watam-language borrowing that has all but
                replaced Tayap’s awo.awo             The Tayap word for the affirmative ‘Yes’. Since the 1980s,
                however, it has become replaced by ore, and the meaning of
                awo has shifted to express sarcastic agreement that would be
                translated in English as ‘Yeah, right’ or ‘Like I’m so sure’.
                The word has also taken on connotations of confrontation and
                violence. It is shouted at others whom one is prepared to strike.
                Parents use it frequently to threaten disobedient children, and
                an adult engaged in a shouting match with another adult might
                use it to signal that her or his patience is about to give in. When
                it is shouted with sharp, rising volume and strong stress on the
                final syllable awó, the word is a warning that means: ‘You haven’t
                listened to my warnings and now I’m about to come and hit you!’wákare         ‘No’. This is also the morpheme of negation, often shortened to
                wak when used to mean ‘No’ (as in: ‘Is there any food left?’ ‘No’).
                When asked as a sharp question with rising intonation, wákare
                signifies a threat, meaning: ‘So you’re not doing what I told you
                to do? (I’m therefore going to come and hit you)’.ario            ‘He/she/it is coming to get you’. This word is used to scare
                babies and small children. It is uttered preceded by the name of
                the person or thing that the caregiver wants the child to think is
                coming to get him or her, and is a vocative call, calling directly
                to the person or thing to come and get the baby (in order to hit
                the baby, or devour the baby).kapambínana ‘Exactly’, ‘Of course’

"Villagers’ debates and language shiftSomething similar to the ‘wind problem’ occurred with a word that I would have
thought was common and uncontroversial – the word for ‘rainbow’. One morning
344        Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionaryafter a night of heavy rain, a large rainbow appeared in the sky. On my way to
wash my clothes in one of the village waterholes, I saw the rainbow and realized
that I didn’t know what it was called in Tayap. So I asked the first person I saw – a
fluent speaker of Tayap in his late thirties – what one calls a rainbow in Tayap.
     “Renbo”, he responded, without missing a beat.
     Um, no, I told him, that must be the Tok Pisin word – the Tayap word had to be
something else. The man told me that in that case, he didn’t know, and that I should
go ask his father, sixty-five-year-old Monei Mbanaŋ, who was my main language
informant at the time. I went off to find Monei and thus did my innocent query
launch a month of acrimonious debate from one end of the village to the other.
     I found Monei sitting on his veranda and I asked him the word for rainbow.
He pondered for awhile. He told me he couldn’t remember the word offhand; he
needed to think about it. He thought for several days. Finally, he told me that
‘rainbow’ had no single word in Tayap; instead, ‘rainbow’ was expressed by the
verb phrase akɨn tamtiek, ‘cloud is marked with color’. This sounded reasonable
to me, and I duly recorded it. But when I repeated it to other speakers to check
their reactions, I was universally met with disdain. “Em giaman” – ‘He’s lying’,
everyone sneered, using their favorite expression to dismiss another speaker’s
expertise in Tayap. Even though no one could think of the correct term themselves,
they all told me they knew that the phrase Monei had volunteered was wrong.
     Days went by and no one could come up with ‘rainbow’. Older villagers
explained to me that their parents and older relatives had warned them about
rainbows, saying they should never walk underneath one, because if they did,
their minds would become clouded and confused. But even though they remem-
bered these cautions, no senior speaker could recall the word for ‘rainbow’
that their parents and relatives had used while articulating them. The word for
‘rainbow’, villagers told me, “i hait” – it was hiding. (In the villagers’ defense, I
should note that rainbows are not exactly common occurrences in Gapun – I only
saw that one the entire eight months I was there in 2009).
     Eventually Monei’s old wife, Sopak Waiki, told me that she had a dream in
which the true word for ‘rainbow’ had been whispered to her by a dead ancestor.
The word, she revealed, was mɨnuomb – a word that otherwise means ‘large
round lake’. Sopak said that the way to say ‘rainbow’ in Tayap was to say akɨnnɨ
mɨnuomb utok, ‘a round lake appeared in the clouds’.
     I told other senior speakers of Sopak’s revelation. They were unmoved. “Em
giaman”, they all pronounced, impassively.
     A few days later, one of the oldest men in the village told me that he had
remembered the word – it was wagurmos.
     The other speakers’ judgement fell predictably: “Em giaman”, they all said.
They explained that wagurmos meant the white film one sees in the sky at night
                                          Villagers’ debates and language shift     345
– that is, the Milky Way. It doesn’t mean ‘rainbow’ at all. Many older speakers also
took the opportunity to disparage the linguistic knowledge of the old man who
had offered wagurmos. That speaker may be old, they said belittlingly, but he’s
“lapun nating” – he’s grown old without having learned anything. All he has,
people said, is “bebi sens” – the sense of a baby.
     Weeks passed and frustration grew. But finally, having heard about the
senior speakers’ search for ‘rainbow’, a young man in his 30s one day came and
told me that he had once heard his grandfather, Kruni Ayarpa, say the word for
‘rainbow’. Kruni had been one of my language informants in the 1980s; he died
in the early 1990s. For the last few decades of his life, Kruni had been universally
respected and vaguely feared as an elder who knew everything about Gapun’s
history and who spoke flawless and eloquent Tayap. The young man reported
that as a child, he had once been together with Kruni when women from the
neighboring village of Wongan mentioned rainbows, which are called mamor in
their Kopar language. They asked Kruni what the word in Tayap was. Kruni told
them that it was mamar.
     Rather than being a breakthrough, this word, too, was rejected. “It means
‘banana’”, all the old people responded dryly when, without telling them why, I
asked them to define mamar. And indeed, it does mean a kind of banana. But in
the end, unable to come up with a word or expression that satisfied them all, and
undoubtedly growing annoyed at my persistence in questioning them, the older
villagers begrudgingly agreed that mamar must be the word for ‘rainbow’ too,
since Kruni apparently had claimed it was.
     My own conclusion is that mamar probably was the Tayap word for ‘rainbow’.
Tayap and Kopar share quite a few nouns, because speakers of the two languages
have been in contact with one another for a very long time. The kind of slight
phonetic variation between mamor and mamar are common in the words shared
by the two languages. For example:                        Tayap                 Kopar
  crocodile             orem                  oreo
  cockatoo              kaimwa                keimwa
  turtle                pawp                  pup
  lorikeet              njijerɨk              njijerɨŋ
  hook                  pipiŋgabu             bibigabuFor those all those reasons, I have entered ‘rainbow’ as one of the definitions of
mamar. I recount the little epic of finally getting that word, though, in order to
illustrate the fact that not all of the entries contained in this dictionary will satisfy
all the current speakers of Tayap.
346        Tayap-English-Tok Pisin Dictionary     In fact, this inability to satisfy all the current speakers of a Tayap is a feature
of the language that may be contributing to its demise. I was continually struck by
how vigorously (and, to my mind, how gratuitously) senior speakers of Tayap dis-
counted and ridiculed one another’s linguistic competence. Early on, I stopped
trying to discuss Tayap in groups of old people because any discussion of any
aspect of the language would inevitably result in bickering. Speakers might even-
tually grouchily agree on whatever it was I was asking them about, but later on,
they would always arrange a private moment with me to heartily dismiss the
knowledge and opinions of their fellow speakers.
     While it escapes no one’s attention that Tayap is a tiny language spoken
nowhere else but in Gapun (and by Gapun villagers living in the neighboring
village of Wongan), knowledge about language is regarded as a private, rather than
a communal, possession. This way of thinking about language is an extension of
the villagers’ more general ethos of ownership. Gapun villagers would shake their
heads in absolute bewilderment at the persistent Western stereotypes about how
a rainforest-dwelling people like themselves supposedly eschew ownership and
share their natural resources in a kind of prelapsarian socialist ecological bliss.
     On the contrary. In Gapun, nothing is communal, nothing is equally owned
and shared by everyone. Everything – every area of land, every sago palm, every
coconut palm, every mango tree, every pot, plate, axe, machete, discarded spear
shaft, broken kerosene lamp, and every anything else one can think of – is owned
by someone (including people’s names and the right to bestow them, as well
as knowledge of myths, songs, and curing chants). Villagers guard their rights
of ownership energetically and they defend them loudly (see Kulick 1992 for an
extended discussion of this that is as relevant today as it was twenty years ago).
     This understanding of possession and ownership has consequences for lan-
guage: it means that the sociolinguistic truism of a common “shared” language
has little purchase in Gapun. In their own view, villagers don’t “share” a lan-
guage. Instead, each speaker owns his or her own version of the language. And
the older those speakers become, the more they regard their version as the proper
one and everyone else’s as “giaman” (false, a lie; takwat in Tayap). This absence
of a language ideology that regards a common language as something “shared”
means that speakers are predisposed to not regard the loss of Tayap as particu-
larly traumatic. Fluent elder speakers still have ‘their’ Tayap; if younger speakers
don’t possess a version of it as, well, “wari bilong ol”. That’s their problem.","[363, 364, 365, 366]"
"1.2 Past research on TayapThe history of linguistic research on Tayap is very brief. In 1937, Gapun was visited
by one of the few white men ever to make it there. This was Georg Höltker, a
German S.V.D. (Societas Verbi Divini) missionary and anthropologist. Höltker
went to Gapun in the company of another missionary based in the coastal village
of Watam, and he spent three hours in the village. He took two photographs and
collected a word list.
     A year later, Höltker published the list of 125 words, together with the weary
remark that “it will be awhile before any other researcher ‘stumbles across’
Gapun, if only because of the small chances of worthwhile academic yields in
this tiny village community, and also because of the inconvenient and arduous
route leading to this linguistic island” (1938: 280). (A translation of Höltker’s
short article is included here in Appendix 1, along with the two photographs he
took in Appendix 2).
     Höltker’s brief squib remained all that was known about Tayap until the early
1970s, when the Australian linguist Don Laycock travelled around the lower Sepik
to collect basic vocabulary lists that allowed him to identify and propose classi-
fications of the many languages spoken there. Laycock never visited Gapun, but
he did get as far as neighboring Wongan, and he interviewed two Gapun villag-
ers who were staying there at the time, Kawi Waiki and Konjab Akumbi (Laycock
1973: 35).
     On the basis of the word list and a few verb paradigms that he gathered
from Kawi and Konjab, Laycock classified Tayap (which he called “Gapun”) as a
sub-phylum of the Sepik-Ramu language phylum. In the classification terminol-
ogy used by Laycock and his linguistic colleagues in the 1970s, this meant that
Tayap shared less than twelve percent of its basic vocabulary with other members
of the phylum, and also that it exhibited marked differences from other members
of the phylum – in Tayap’s case, gender pronouns and other differences related
                                                            Past research on Tayap        9
to gender marking were mentioned. (The word list used by Laycock appears as an
appendix to his 1973 article. A discussion of the classifying criteria used to sort
out Papuan languages is in Wurm 1982: 65–72.)
     Laycock included one other language in what he called the “Gapun
sub-phylum level family”. This was a language of over two thousand speak-
ers, called Bungain. Bungain is geographically distant from Gapun (off to the
north and west of Map 1.2, see page 13), and Gapuners have no social, cultural
or economic ties or affinities with – or even knowledge of – Bungain speakers.
The relationship that Laycock postulated between Tayap and Bungain was not
based on any solid data or analysis – it was based on the basic vocabulary list
he used, as well as some rudimentary grammatical information, such as trans-
lations of ‘Give me tobacco’, ‘I cannot give you any, I have none’, ‘If I had some I
would give it to you’. Laycock himself noted that all his classifications of Sepik
languages were “tentative” and “impressionistic” (1973: 2). His description of
the supposed similarities between Bungain and Tayap, in its entirety, consists
of the following:    The languages show complex verb morphology, after the manner of Nor-Pondo languages
    (subject marking by prefix in Bungain, and suffix in Gapun); but there is apparently no
    noun classification, and no indication of number in nouns. Gapun has a third-feminine
    pronoun; Bungain appears to lack this, but there is apparent gender concordance
    in verbs.
                                                                          (Laycock 1973: 35)
Aside from the remark about complex verb morphology – which is a feature
shared by many Papuan languages – this description makes Bungain and Tayap
sound more dissimilar than similar (it also turns out that Tayap, in fact, does mark
number on a restricted class of nouns; see Section 3.1.3). In an attempt to assess
the feasibility of Laycock’s classification of Tayap and Bungain, I looked through
the field data on which he based the classification, namely his field notebooks D7,
D26 and D27, which are deposited in the Linguistics Department at the Australian
National University, where Laycock worked.2
     Unfortunately, the notebooks turned out to be of quite limited use, because
Laycock often did not translate the vernacular words he noted down in his field
notebooks. He numbered the words, but his numbering does not correspond to
2 I am grateful to the collective efforts of Melissa Crowther, Mark Donohue, Nicholas Evans,
Ewan Maidment, Doug Marmion, Malcom Ross and Nick Thieberger in helping me track down
and obtain scanned copies of these notebooks.
10       1 The Tayap language and its speakersthe list he provides in his published article on how he classified them (Laycock
1973: 70–71).
     For example, in his Bungain fieldnotes, a word Laycock does translate, as
‘snake’ (atop’), is numbered 172. But in the published list, ‘snake’ is word number
152. Eight untranslated words follow atop’, but the ninth, kwulémbe, Laycock
translates as ‘mosquito’. The problem is that in the word list published in his
article, ‘mosquito’ comes eleven words after ‘snake’. These kinds of discrepancies
make it impossible to use the word list Laycock provided in his article to identify
the untranslated vernacular words he noted down in his field notebooks. This is
not a problem with Laycock’s Tayap material, because I know the meaning of all
the words he noted down. But since I know no Bungain, much of his list for that
language is unrevealing.
     As far as I am able to tell, there are no lexical similarities between Bungain
and Tayap, beyond a couple of words that are common throughout the Sepik,
such as the word for water (Bungain: wi; Tayap awin). Grammatically and mor-
phologically, I could discern no similarities between Tayap and Bungain, and
after examining the fieldnotes I was at a loss to understand the basis for his state-
ment that “their relationship with each other is clear but not close” (Laycock and
Z’graggen 1975: 757).
     My own suspicion is that Laycock couldn’t easily fit either Tayap or Bungain
into the language families he had developed for the Sepik region, and so he
simply guessed that they might be related to one another. Later researchers
have suggested that Bungain may be a Torricelli phylum language (Sanders and
Sanders 1980: 188). Foley (2018) classes Bungain as a member of the Marienberg
Hills family, a subgroup of the Torricelli family. He bases the classification of
Bungain on morphological criteria gleaned from his own fieldwork data, which
he describes as “brief” (Foley 2018: 304). He provides some of this data, includ-
ing a pronoun paradigm, subject agreement prefixes, morphological description
and some sentence material in his major descriptive work on the Sepik-Ramu
languages (2018: 197–431). None of this material is suggestive of a relationship
between Bungain and Tayap.
     To illustrate how different Tayap is from neighboring languages, I have
added it to the “Lower Sepik family basic word list” that appears in William
Foley’s 1986 book, The Papuan languages of New Guinea. To enable the table to
appear on a single page, I have omitted one of the languages in the original table
(Karawari). The (K) after words in the Murik column indicates forms in the Kopar
language.

guages listed in this table, such as the words for ‘village’, ‘water’, ‘lime’ (that
is, the white powder made of bivalve shells that villagers pulverize and chew
together with betel nut) and ‘eat’. The Tayap verb meaning ‘go’ is realized as wak-
in the habitual progressive aspect and the counterfactual mood (see Sections 8.3
and 9.4.3), thus probably making it cognate with Yimas, Chambri and Murik. The
Tayap word for ‘woman’ is cognate with Angoram’s ‘female’, and the words for
‘fire’, ‘pig’, ‘one’, ‘egg’, perhaps ‘three’ and a few others are similar to some of the
words in one or more of the other languages.
     A few words, such as those for ‘canoe’ and ‘oar’ are borrowings – Gapuners only
learned to paddle canoes after WWII, when they moved their village from its former
site up on a mountain down closer to the mangrove lagoon. They did this so that it
would be easier for them to transport the cash crops they heard they should grow
– at the time, those were rice and peanuts – out of the village and to waiting buyers
(who for the most part never materialized). All words related to canoes, paddles and
fishing in the mangrove lagoon are borrowings from the Kopar language.
     But despite the cognates that do exist – something that one would expect
given that people in the lower Sepik have had various forms of contact with one
another for a very long time – it is striking that Tayap is so different from other
Lower Sepik languages. Of the fifty words listed, at least thirty five of them, or
seventy percent, are unique.

"1.6 Tayap linguistic profileLike many Sepik languages, Tayap is a synthetic language. Verbs are the most
elaborated area of the grammar. They are complex, fusional and massively sup-
pletive, with opaque verbal morphology including unpredictable conjugation
classes, both in terms of membership and formal marking. There are very many
suppletive stem forms marking a basic realis-irrealis distinction as well as various
other TAM categories. Person/number marking also differs depending on the verb
type. This is a language of “baroque accretions” (McWhorter 2001); or what Dahl
(2004) calls “mature phenomena”.
     There is a fundamental distinction in verbal morphology between realis and
irrealis stems and suffixes, but this distinction is overridden by transitivity in the
prohibitive and counterfactual forms.
     Grammatical relations are marked by verbal suffixes, which distinguish
S/A versus O. In some conjugations S/A is marked by discontinuous mor-
phemes. Free pronouns and noun phrases mark the ergative case (A) compared
to unmarked forms for the absolutive (S/O). As in many Papuan languages
which have an ergative case, the ergative marker is optional and is frequently
omitted.
     There are two genders, masculine and feminine, marked not on the noun
itself but on deictics, the ergative marker, suppletive verbal stems and verbal
affixes. The unmarked, generic form of all nouns, including animate nouns,
even humans, is feminine: however, a male referent may be masculine. Another
criterion is size and shape: long, thin and large referents tend to be masculine;
short, stocky and small referents tend to be feminine. Again this type of gender-
assignment system is typical of the Sepik region.
     Gender is only ever marked in the singular, never in the dual or plural. Nouns
generally do not mark number themselves, although there is a small class of
largely human nouns which mark plural, and a smaller class which mark dual.
These categories, where marked, are largely marked by partial or full supple-
tion. Oblique cases, largely local, are marked by clitics attached to the end of the
oblique NP. Two adjectives also mark number, with partially suppletive forms for
singular, dual and plural. A further two adjectives have partially suppletive forms
for singular and plural.
26        1 The Tayap language and its speakers     Phonologically, the language has a medium-sized consonant inventory with
voiceless stops, voiced (prenasalized) stops, nasals, semivowels and a rhotic/
lateral flap. There are six vowels, /a/, /i/, /ɛ/, /u/, /ɔ/ and /ɵ/. Stress is largely pre-
dictable, typically word final but occasionally occurring elsewhere in the word.
     The expression of possession is relatively simple: a possessor is marked with
a clitic, and there are no subcategories of possession.
     There are two kinds of complex predicate, which can be distinguished
morpho-syntactically: serial verb constructions; and complex predicates formed
with the verb ‘to be’, which consist of progressives and habituals. There are three
types of complex clause: coordinate, cosubordinate (medial-final clause chains)
and subordinate clauses. Subordinate clauses consist of relative clauses, adver-
bial clauses, and perception constructions, as well as finite nominalizations.
2 Phonology and orthography2.1 PhonologyTayap forms in this and all chapters are presented in the orthography as outlined
below (Section 2.8) except in the consonant and vowel phoneme tables and when
cited inside square brackets.","[45, 46, 47]"
"     Furthermore, the population of Gapun village is overwhelmingly young:
ninety percent of the total population is under forty years old, and only three
people in the village are over sixty years old. Today only about sixty people
actively command Tayap and only about forty five use the language to any extent
in their day-to-day lives.
     This grammar and dictionary is an attempt to document and preserve a small
part of the linguistic heritage of the Gapun people. Its publication will without
doubt have little or no impact on Tayap’s impending demise. Gapuners of today
have little need for their vernacular. They also have little desire for it – even
though no villager ever openly acknowledges this.
     Many instances of language death around the world start when adults more
or less consciously neglect to teach their home language to their children because
they want the children to succeed in school or because the home language is
socially stigmatized. This is not the situation in Gapun. No one in Gapun has
ever explicitly rejected Tayap, and no one disparages it or suggests that it should
be forgotten. On the contrary, Gapuners all express positive sentiments towards
their vernacular language. They all say they like it. Older adults occasionally flare
up and berate young people and children for not knowing it.
                    General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun   3
     But despite positive sentiments toward Tayap, day-to-day village life is now
overwhelmingly conducted in Tok Pisin. Village-wide meetings are in Tok Pisin,
church services are in Tok Pisin, gatherings in the men’s house are in Tok Pisin,
chatter on the field during soccer matches is in Tok Pisin, talk among women
visiting new mothers in maternity houses is in Tok Pisin. Informal conversations
involving villagers over thirty-five often involve code-switching between Tayap
and Tok Pisin, depending on who is present. But most conversations in Gapun,
between most people, take place mostly in Tok Pisin. Even private, intimate con-
versations occur overwhelmingly in Tok Pisin: young men who go off together in
groups to engage in secret rituals that make them feel lighter and more attractive
speak Tok Pisin to one another. Husbands and wives under thirty, when they are
alone together, speak Tok Pisin – a fact I know because when I asked a husband
or a wife to give me their opinion on their spouse’s competence in Tayap, they
usually answered that they couldn’t, because they almost never heard their
spouse speak Tayap.
     When villagers panic – for example when a drunken young man hurls himself
through the village swinging a machete at anyone he sees, or when a child is
bitten by a death adder in the middle of the village and no one knows where it
went – on occasions like those, the overwhelming bulk of everyone’s alarmed
screams to one another, tellingly, is in Tok Pisin, not Tayap.
     Equally tellingly, even senior villagers’ admonitions to younger people to
speak Tayap tend to be shouted in Tok Pisin. There is never any consistent effort
to teach children Tayap; indeed, whenever young people do occasionally attempt
to say something in it, any adult who hears them will often dismiss them with
a chuckle or a sneer, and loudly bemoan how poorly they speak the vernacular
language.
     Language loss is inevitably linked to cultural change, and during the past
few decades, Gapun has changed dramatically. The changes have not been eco-
nomic: Gapun villagers of today are not materially much better off than their great-
grandparents. Nor are villagers radically different from their post-war predecessors
in terms of their understandings of their place in the world: like their grandpar-
ents, today’s villagers still believe that Papua New Guineans are “the last country”
and that one day, hopefully soon, Jesus will return to Earth and bestow upon them
all the goods and riches that they believe He has already rewarded white people
with, everywhere else in the world. (The complexity of all this is the subject of my
two anthropological monographs on the village, Kulick 1992 and Kulick 2019.)
     What makes villagers of today very different from the generation born in
the 1940s and earlier is that the overwhelming majority of the social, cultural
and ritual practices that link them to their history have vanished. The men’s
house cult, which for generations was the backbone of Gapun culture, is broken.
4       1 The Tayap language and its speakersPreviously important social bonds – for example, relations between joking kin,
which are inherited relations to certain members of the clans into which one may
marry (njakum in Tayap, “wanpilai” in Tok Pisin) – are no longer observed and for
the most part no longer even known. Traditional healing rites, which depended
on knowing, respecting, flattering and sometimes threatening the spirits of ances-
tors and the powers of the rainforest, are now all regarded as suspicious at best
and Satanic at worst. Funerary rituals, which once engaged entire villages and
were occasions for important social gatherings, great feasts and the momentous
playing of the sacred flutes in the men’s house – these are all moribund.
     For the past fifty years, villagers have been much more interested in trying to
be good Catholics (villagers began to be baptized by visiting missionaries in the
early 1950s), trying to get their children educated, and trying to discover a way to
make money so that they can “develop” than they have been in talking about or
preserving their traditions.
     Like perhaps most people around the world, Gapuners care much more about
their future than they do about their past. And a price they seem destined to pay
for their enthusiastic orientation towards the future is not only the loss of their
traditions and history, but also the loss of their ancestral language.
     The death of languages is a phenomenon that linguists, anthropologists
and activists for indigenous and ethnic rights have long been aware of, and con-
cerned about. Much early linguistic and anthropological work was devoted to
“salvaging” what could be documented of traditions and languages that were
fading to extinction in the early decades of the twentieth century. During the past
twenty years, however, awareness of language death has turned from concern to
alarm.
     Linguists have realized that languages are becoming extinct at a rate seem-
ingly unprecedented in history. It is sobering to realize, for example, that ninety
percent of the indigenous languages spoken upon Cook’s arrival in Australia are
either dead or on the verge of dying. One overview has called the United States
“a graveyard for hundreds of languages” (Nettle and Romaine 2000: 5), noting
that eighty percent of the indigenous languages that still even exist there are
no longer being learned by children. Thirty percent of the languages spoken in
South America are thought to be “no longer viable”. And so on. The most widely
cited estimate of language death is the ominous prediction that ninety percent of
the world’s approximately six thousand languages are endangered (Krauss 1992,
Evans 2010). This figure, which at first glance seems hyperbolic and unbeliev-
able, becomes more comprehensible the moment it is realized that most people
in the world speak one or more of the one hundred largest languages. Those
big languages, linguists claim, are spoken by ninety six percent of the world’s
population.
                      General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun          5
    This means that four percent of the world’s population speaks the over-
whelming majority of the world’s languages. And those languages – thousands of
them, many of them undocumented – are believed to be in danger of vanishing
within the next one hundred years.
    Tayap is one of those languages. And in the literature on language death that
began burgeoning in the 1990s, it has sometimes been featured as a poignant
example. It is discussed, for example, in Daniel Nettle and Suzanne Romaine’s
comprehensive overview of language extinction around the world. Those lin-
guists cite my earlier work on Gapun (employing the spelling of “Tayap” that I
used previously; Kulick 1992) to make the point that:    Taiap is an amazingly rich language in terms of its structural diversity and particularly
    distinctive vocabulary, unlike any other in the Sepik. It is not clearly related to any other
    language in the area or indeed to any other language in Papua New Guinea as far as we can
    tell. (2000:13)
This celebration of Tayap’s uniqueness and complexity is a buildup that leads
to a somber punchline: “While further research might provide clues about the
precise genetic relationship between Taiap and other languages, this is unlikely
to happen. Taiap is dying”, write Nettle and Romaine, employing a baleful tone
that is characteristic of work on language death around the world.
     No one could dispute that the disappearance of a human language is a cause
for lamentation and mourning. And it would be insensitive and beside the point
to critique linguists’ attempts to inform a wider public about the widespread lan-
guage extinction that appears to be occurring across the globe today. But even
as we acknowledge and appreciate this, it is still possible to be skeptical of what
has emerged as a dominant way in which linguists discuss language death –
the likening of endangered languages to endangered animals and endangered
plants.
     Nettle and Romaine, for example, liken Tayap to a great bird. They write, “if
Taiap were a rare species of bird or Ubykh [another endangered language they
discuss] a dying coral reef, maybe more people would know of their plight and
be concerned”. And they continue, asking dramatically, “Should we be any less
concerned about Taiap than we are about the passing of the California condor?”
(2000: 13–14).
     A question like that is difficult to answer, not least because it is far from
obvious what “our” concern that Tayap is dying might actually materialize in prac-
tice, and what consequences those material expressions of “our” concern might
have for anyone living in Gapun. There is also a problem with likening Tayap to a
condor because exquisite as languages may be, they really are not like condors or
6       1 The Tayap language and its speakerscoral reefs. Condor chicks are not sent to schools where they are taught in a cos-
mopolitan language they’ve barely ever heard, and where they learn to devalue
their traditional condor ways. Coral reefs are not converted to Christianity and
told that their traditional reef ways are Satanic.
     To be fair, none of these things happen to languages either. But they do
happen to speakers of many of the languages that linguists are so concerned
about. Linguists like Nettle and Romaine who use species metaphors under-
stand this, of course. But in the current cultural climate that exhorts people
to develop concern for the environment and sustainability, many linguists
seem to believe that they can elicit some kind of sympathy and support for
dying languages if they talk about them in terms of biodiversity and species
loss.
     This way of thinking about language death is specious, however, because
it directs our attention to the natural world. By encouraging us to think in
terms of ecosystems rather than political systems, ecological or species met-
aphors elide, or at least defer, the simple realization that language death is
anything but a natural phenomenon. On the contrary, it is a profoundly social
phenomenon.
     Languages die because people stop speaking them, not because they exhaust
themselves in the fullness of time or are killed off by predatory languages of
greater phonological scope or syntactic richness.
     A better metaphor for language death, instead of seeing languages as
animals or organisms, would be to think of them like political movements,
philosophies or religions – that is, to consider them as social phenomena that
cannot be comprehended apart from history, beliefs, economics, desire, struc-
ture and power. And that necessarily change and sometimes even disappear as
the material, economic, social and cultural conditions that sustain them shift
and transform.
     With that in mind, and given the current state and tenor of Gapun village life,
I wish to make it clear that this grammar and dictionary of Tayap is not an effort to
influence the future. It is, instead, a record that documents what I am convinced
soon will be the irrevocable past. Gapun villagers are ceasing to speak their lan-
guage and if present trends persist, in thirty or forty years, Tayap will be gone
forever. While this is inconsolably sad, it is the villagers’ choice. It is a choice I
have no doubt that their descendants will castigate them for, as always eventually
happens with languages that die.
     But I do not write this grammar and dictionary with the fantasy that its
appearance will somehow change villagers’ lives and make them revive their
dying language. Indeed, I recognize that the opposite may – and at this point
probably will – happen. The appearance of Tayap words printed in a book may
                       General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun           7
foster resignation and complacency: a sense that, “Well now our language is all
there in a book, so we don’t really have to worry about it anymore, our children
can learn it from the book when they’re grown up”. Tayap in a book may also
solidify a view that the language is an august tongue of the ancestors far too
majestic and esoteric for young people to ever even attempt to master.
     So why write a book about Tayap? Partly to preserve some small part of the
proverbial treasure chest of human knowledge, certainly. But mostly, I have
written this grammar and dictionary primarily in the hope that a curious young
Gapuner, sometime in the probably distant future, will discover it somewhere and
value the fact that the obsolete language of his or her ancestors did not disappear
without a trace.
     The dictionary that accompanies this grammar is trilingual: Tayap, English
and Tok Pisin. A few of the villagers in Gapun have had as many as ten years of
schooling, most of it in English. Despite that, though (or, really, because of that),
none of them currently possesses anything but the most rudimentary command of
that language.1 No villager today will be able to make much sense of this grammar
of Tayap, but the dictionary part of this work may be entertaining and useful to
them now, as opposed to some distant future. And to facilitate that usefulness, I
have included definitions in the language that is replacing Tayap and in which all
villagers are fluent: Tok Pisin.
     I have also provided many examples of how the words in the dictionary
are used in Tayap, and I have purposely included a large number of vulgarities.
Gapun villagers are no different from anyone else who has ever scoured a dictio-
nary to see if it dared to list the most obscene terms that one and one’s sniggering
friends could dream up. I hope that the shock of seeing some of their most vulgar
words and insults immortalized in a book will provide the villagers with a great
deal of guilty pleasure.
     This grammar and dictionary should be of interest to linguists who study
Sepik and Ramu languages and the genealogical relationships of Papuan lan-
guages more generally. It should also interest archeologists and historians who
study the peopling and linguistic diversity of the Sepik region of Papua New
Guinea.","[22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27]"
"6.2.1 Four basic groups of intransitive verbsIntransitive verbs have four basic sets of suffixes used on the realis stem to encode
the person, gender and number of the subject. They are as follows:

8.2.1) written with its irrealis marker (-kɨ, -ki or -ku), for two reasons: (a) in order to make it easier
to tell the difference between intransitive verbs and transitive verbs, which do not have irrealis
markers; and (b) to indicate which of the three irrealis morphemes is used on specific intransi-
tive verbs. In addition, note that the various stem alternations such as (p/Ø), (p/w), (p/m), etc.
are indicated in the dictionary, under the proper entry. So the entry for eiwkɨ, for example, looks
like this: eiwkɨ v.i. (peiwiet/peiwiek, ŋgɨ peiwko), wash sago pith; wasim saksak.","[211, 212]"
"(2) The forms in the parentheses following the entry are the verb’s realis forms.
    If the forms are regular, only a few will be listed, in order to allow a reader
    to identify them by looking at Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 of the Grammar. In the
    case of ‘laugh’, a glance at Section 6.2.1 reveals that the endings -ot and -ok
    indicate that ‘laugh’ is a Group IV intransitive verb, and that pirot means ‘I
    (m) laughed’, ‘you (m) laughed’, or ‘he laughed’; pirok means ‘I (f) laughed’,
    ‘you (f) laughed’, ‘she laughed’ or ’we laughed’. The forms that verbs that
    belong to this Group take for all other persons are found in that Section.",[360]
"
4.2 Participles with the non-finite suffix -(ŋ)garThe suffix -(ŋ)gar forms a participle, consisting of a verb stem plus the non-finite
suffix (ŋ)gar (realized as -gar after nd, t and sometimes r). Nouns formed with the
-(ŋ)gar suffix are attributes: they denote a habitual, stative or agentive quality.
Note this suffix is also used in counterfactuals (Section 9.4.3).
108        4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possession(4-12) a. munje wasowŋgar aram
          munje    wasow    -ŋgar              aram
          man      die.irr  -nfn.sg            snake
          ‘poisonous snake’       b. morasi apro nirŋgar munje
          morasi     apro     nir      -ŋgar       munje
          habit      bad      do.irr   -nfn.sg     man
          ‘bad man’ (lit. ‘man who does bad things’)In both the examples above, the participle formed with -(ŋ)gar carries the
meaning of habituality: the snake is (always) venomous; the man is someone who
is known for habitually doing bad things. These constructions also express agen-
tive nominalizations – i.e. expressions like ‘killer of men’ or ‘doer of bad things’.
So a sentence like the following:(4-13) yu yimbar andurgar
       yu     yimbar    andur             -gar
       2sg    canoe     carve.irr         -nfn.sgmeans both ‘you carve canoes’ (often or habitually) and ‘you are a canoe carver’;
that is, the fact that you carve canoes is a characteristic by which other people
know you.
    The same is true of the following sentence:(4-14) ŋa sokoi aŋgar
       ŋa     sokoi         a                   -ŋgar
       1sg    tobacco       consume.irr         -nfn.sgThis can be translated both as the habitual ‘I smoke’ (in the sense of smoking
regularly or habitually) and as the stative ‘I am a smoker’ (as opposed to being a
non-smoker).
     The suffix-(ŋ)gar takes no TAM marking, even though it occurs in a position
after the verb stem that normally would be filled with an irr suffix (for intransi-
tive verbs) or an object suffix inflected for TAM (for transitive verbs). The follow-
ing sentence illustrates:(4-15) munje kowot inde ŋɨ             nɨpɨs Merew =re o -ŋgar
       man      old    dx.m 3sg.m able Sanae =all go.irr -nfn.sg
       ‘the old man is able to go to Sanae’
                                                      The ergative case (erg)     109
Even though the nfn suffix does not inflect for TAM, it does inflect to express
person and number, according to the following pattern:
           singular    dual     plural1          -ŋgar       -ŋgre    -ŋgar
2          -ŋgar       -ŋgrem   -ŋgrem
3sg.m/f    -ŋgar       -ŋgre    -ŋgro
Thus, one says:(4-16)    ŋgɨ    kakau           tow           -ŋgro
          3pl cocoa (TP)         plant.irr     -nfn.3pl
          ‘they plant cocoa’ (generally, habitually); ‘they are cocoa planters’(4-17)    ŋɨ        kakau           tow           -ŋgar
          3sg.m     cocoa (TP)      plant.irr     -nfn.sg|1pl
          ‘he plants cocoa’ (generally, habitually); ‘he is a cocoa planter’Because these constructions are nominalizations and not verbs, they do not
negate like verbs. They are non-verbal predications. All one does to negate them
is add the negator wákare (see Section 5.2).
     So compare:(4-18)    a.   ŋgɨ sokoi aŋgro
               ŋgɨ    sokoi       a                   -ŋgro
               3pl tobacco        consume.irr         -nfn.3pl
               ‘they smoke’; ‘they are smokers’          b.   ŋgɨ sokoi aŋgro wákare
               ŋgɨ    sokoi      a                -ŋgro        wákare
               3pl tobacco consume.irr -nfn.3pl                neg
               ‘they don’t smoke’; ‘they are not smokers’4.3 The ergative case (erg)Tayap optionally marks the subject (A) of a transitive verb with an ergative
case clitic, on noun phrases and free personal pronouns (note that subject and
object verbal pronominal suffixes follow a nominative-accusative system, see
Section 5.3).
110           4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possession      Note the difference in the first word of the following two sentences:(4-19) a. Sopak wokara
          Sopak       wok                      -ara
          Sopak-Ø     go.3sg.f.r               -perf
          ‘Sopak has gone’            b. Sopakyi taruŋg kratukun
               Sopak =yi        taruŋg  kra -tu -ku        -n
               Sopak =erg.f firewood chop.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
               ‘Sopak chopped firewood’In (4-19a), there is no object, and the subject (S) of the sentence, Sopak, is
unmarked.
     In (4-19b), Sopak performs an action on an object. That object, like the subject
of the previous sentence, is unmarked. But Sopak receives the ergative clitic =yi,
which identifies her as the subject of the transitive clause.
     The ergative clitics that attach to the subject NP of a transitive verb also
encode gender and number. The markers that occur on NPs are:      =ŋi      masculine ergative
      =yi      feminine ergative (becomes =i when it follows r, t, nd, w and
               often k)
      =gi      plural ergativeNote that as in all other areas of Tayap grammar, gender is not indicated in the
plural number, so a word like rorsem=gi (‘children=erg.pl’) can refer to either
male or female children.
    These ergative clitics are also attached to the personal pronouns in a pattern
that maintains the plural meaning of =gi but not the gendered meaning of =ŋi
and =yi on 1sg and 2sg. In other words, gender is not marked in 1st and 2nd
persons.","[127, 128, 129, 130]"
"9.8.1 Cosubordinate constructions with modifying suffix -ra (mod)Consider the -ra6 construction first, in comparison with two independent clauses
linked by a conjunction:
    Coordinated construction:(9-36) a. ŋɨ pɨŋneta katot

form as ke-wa) and adɨokɨ ‘trip’ (realized as adɨ-wa).
276          9 Simple and complex sentences(9-37) a. ŋgu mamrartaka wok
          ŋgu    mamrar -tak               -a wok
          3sg.f shake.r -2sg.f|3sg.f.r.s -and go.3sg.f.r
          ‘she shook and went/as she went’      Cosubordinate construction:         b. ŋgu mamrara wok
            ŋgu     mamrar -ra wok
            3sg.f shake.r -mod go.3sg.f.r
            ‘she shivered’The difference in meaning between these two forms is subtle. Speakers say that
the fully inflected forms – those in (9-36a) and (9-37a) above – are synonymous
with the -ra forms – those in (9-36b) and (9-37b). Some verbs – ‘jump’ for example –
regularly occur in both forms. At the same time, however, it is clear that the
morpheme -ra does not just link two verbs in a temporal sequence like the con-
junction –(y)a does (Section 9.3.1). Instead, -ra modifies both the verb to which it
affixes and the verb of motion that follows it, creating a new lexical predicate out
of two independent verbs.
     In an important sense, all complex predicates create new lexical verbs by
linking together a series of different verbs. But the difference in this case is this:
other kinds of sequences in Tayap create complex predicates by conjoining verbs
that retain their separate lexical meaning even as they link together in sequences
with other verbs. Their meaning is additive – each verb contributes its particular
meaning to the final compound construction. So a sequence like tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨ-
takana (Section 8.1ff) that was discussed in the previous chapter is composed of sep-
arate constituents that each add their own meaning to the action being expressed,
resulting in a verb that means ‘she will carry him down on her shoulders’.
     Complex clauses created with the -ra suffix, on the other hand, are not addi-
tive, they are transformative. A complex clause created with -ra is not so much the
sum of its parts as it is a new semantic entity. Although many verbs formed with -ra
do retain a transparent relation to the independent verbs that derive them, others
have meanings that are completely different from the two verbs that compose
them. So ‘faint’, for example, is wasowra aiki- (wasow ‘die’ + -ra + aiki ‘come’).7
     Another way in which the -ra suffix transforms verbs is that it reduces their
valency. Compare the verb worer ‘capsize’ in constructions formed with -ra, and
7 This suffix occurs on at least one noun: the way to express that a body part has ‘fallen asleep’,
as one says in English, is to use the derived verb sɨwɨdɨdɨmra okɨ, which comes from the word for
small black ants; so sɨwɨdɨdɨm ‘ants’ + -ra + okɨ ‘go’.

in serial verb constructions formed with a non-final verb + a final verb like those
discussed in Section 8.2:(9-38) a. ewar yimbar worerara wok

          1sg =erg water capsize.irr -3sg.f.r.o              go.3sg.f.r
          ‘I poured the water’Notice how the first sentences in these pairs (9-38a) and (9-39a) only has one argu-
ment – the subject, ‘canoe’ in (9-38a) and ‘water’ in (9-39a). The second sentences
have two arguments – subject (‘they’ and ‘I’) and object (‘canoe’ and ‘water’).
     Negation on verbs marked with -ra is only marked on the independent verb
that carries TAM, but its scope is both/all verb stems. So the negation of a verb
like ‘jump’ is:(9-40) ŋɨ       pɨŋ      -ra     atɨ           -kɨ   wákare
       3sg.m jump.r -mod go_down.irr -irr neg
       ‘he didn’t jump down’ or ‘he won’t jump down’9.8.2 Cosubordinate constructions with manner suffix -kar (mann)Like clause chains constructed with -ra, those formed with -kar also add a mor-
pheme directly onto the irrealis stem of a verb that precedes a verb of motion, thus
creating a medial verb. Unlike the -ra forms, however, constructions formed with
-kar or its allophonic variant -kwar (the environment triggering the alternation
278         9 Simple and complex sentencesis unknown) maintain the separate meanings of the modified verb and the verb
of motion that follows it. The suffix -kar creates a manner medial verb, one that
answers the question ‘How or in what manner did X go/come, etc.?’
    Verbs constructed with -kar are constructed in the following way:      irr verb stem + -kar/-kwar + fully inflected verb of motionVerbs formed with -kar encode the simultaneity of both actions for the duration
of both actions. In English, this temporal relationship would be rendered with the
adverbial ‘as’, as in ‘They were laughing as they washed the dishes’, or participle
clauses, as in ‘Laughing, they washed the dishes’. In other words, the first action,
laughing, occurred simultaneously with, and continued for the same length of
time as, the second action, washing the dishes.
    This foregrounding of duration and simultaneity results in awkward literal
translations, as in the following example:(9-41) nda mbɨd non         rekɨ ai        -kar wek
       dm pain indef with come.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
       ‘she came feeling pain as she came’A more idiomatic translation would be with an English adverbial phrase; some-
thing that highlighted the experience of pain as during travel, like ‘In pain, she
made her way here’.
    Cosubordinate constructions created with the -kar suffix also highlight an
action or process that has begun and is continuing, especially when the con-
struction is used with an inanimate subject. In English, this kind of phrase
would use a verb of inception, like ‘begin’ or ‘start’, or a verb of intensifi-
cation or process, like ‘growing’ or ‘becoming’; for example: ‘his anger was
growing’.
    The verb of motion that follows the medial verb created with the -kar suffix is
most commonly either ‘go’ (okɨ) or ‘come’ (aiki), although any verb of motion may
occur in this slot. Examples are:(9-42) a. ŋgu    warak     -kar wek
          3sg.f talk.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
          ‘she came talking’         b. ŋɨ       ŋgar          -kwar mbot
            3sg.m call_out.irr -mann go.sg.m.r
            ‘he called out as he went along’
                                                Cosubordinate constructions      279
The sense of development and process means that these verb forms can co-occur
with other chained forms, such as the -ra forms, for example:(9-43) minjike =ŋa        mbatep pwak         -ra    o       -kar     wek
       betel_nut =poss unit        drop.irr -mod go.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
       ‘the flowers on the betel nut (palm) are in the process of opening’This suggests that the -ra clause and the -kar clause are syntactically equivalent,
both equally dependent on the final verb wek ‘come’.
    The directionality of the verb of motion (‘go’ or ‘come’) can express a differ-
ence in meaning, as in the following:(9-44) a. toto andɨ           -kar      wek
          skin swell.irr -mann come.3sg.f.r
          ‘(my) skin is swelling up’ (in various places because bees have stung me)        b.    toto andɨ          -kar      wok
             skin swell.irr -mann go.3sg.f.r
             ‘(my) skin is swelling up’ (from a central point and spreading outwards)This kind of semantic difference encoded by different verbs of motion may have
been more productive in the past, and subtle nuances may have been eroded and
lost over the course of the last few decades. Today, senior speakers insist that with
only a few exceptions, such as (9-44a) and (9-44b) above, verbs formed with ‘go’
and ‘come’ have the same meaning and can be used interchangeably.
     Chains with -kar are negated by placing the negative marker after the inde-
pendent verb. So the negated form of example (9-42a) is:(9-45) ŋgu    warak      -kar    ai      -ki wákare
       3sg.f talk.irr -mann come.irr -irr neg
       ‘she was not talking as she came’The scope of negation in manner constructions has to include the medial verb.
Thus, the negated sentence means that the woman probably still came (the sen-
tence probably would not have been uttered if she hadn’t come); she just didn’t
come talking.
     This seems to indicate that -kar (and in fact -ra) are complex verbal con-
structions rather than adverbials, since negation of adverbials would be
expressed with the negator directly after the adverbial, not as here at the end
of the clause.
280        9 Simple and complex sentences9.9 Tail-head linkageTayap makes extensive use of tail-head linkage, a phenomenon in which the
last verb of one sentence is repeated as the first verb of the next sentence. It is a
coherence device for structuring discourse and is very common among Papuan
languages (de Vries 2005). In de Vries’s terms, Tayap’s tail-head linkage is the
chained type, utilizing the basic complex clause structures of the language,
namely coordination and subordination.
     Some examples, which are taken from the Tayap Texts at the end of this
grammar, are presented below (see those texts for many more examples of this
phenomenon).
     The following excerpt is a continuous stretch of speech taken from a narrated
story that is presented in its entirety in Text 1. The repeated inflected verbs are in

           ‘It died and there…’In most cases of tail-head linkage, only the verb is repeated. The second instance
of the verb usually occurs with a conjunction marker to connect it to the clause
that follows. However, other material can be repeated too: an example is the
oblique NP repeated with the verb in lines (9-47 a-b).
282          9 Simple and complex sentences9.10 Complex constructions with the suffix signifying
     multiplicity -rar (ml)The final suffix occurring on complex sentences is -rar. This suffix signifies
that the action denoted by the verb occurred in relation to multiple objects – so
‘look at many things’ instead of just ‘look’, or ‘shoot at many things’ instead of
just ‘shoot’. The suffix -rar is always used on transitive verbs. The object mor-
pheme is always in the realis form. TAM is marked on the final, independent
verb of motion that follows the medial verb. Even though the action of the verb
happens multiple times, the object is still singular. So the structure of this form
is as follows:      transitive verb stem irr + object r + -rar + verb of motion inflected for
      subject, TAM and statusExamples are as follows:(9-49) a. tar        -ku         -rar mbet
          take.irr -3sg.f.r.o -ml come.sg.m.r
          ‘he collected several as he came’ (or ‘I (m)’ or ‘you (m)’)         b. o           -ku         -rar mbot
            shoot.irr -3sg.f.r.o -ml go.sg.m.r
            ‘he shot various things as he went’ (or ‘I (m)’ or ‘you (m)’)If the object slot is filled by a ben object rather than a direct object, then -rar is
realized as -tar (see examples 9-49c and d below):      transitive verb stem irr + ben object r + -tar + verb of motion inflected for
      subject, TAM and status         c. kokɨr krar         -mba         -tar weke

Verbs constructed with -rar are negated by negating the final, fully inflected verb
in the series. And like -kar verbs, the scope of negation covers the whole construc-
tion. So the negated form of (9-49a), above, is:(9-50) tar        -ku          -rar ai-ki       wákare
       take.irr -3sg.f.r.o     -ml come.irr-irr neg
       ‘he didn’t come collecting several’9.11 Complex sentences in young people’s TayapYoung people use a great deal of tail-head linkage in their narratives. The narra-
tor of Text 4, for example – a twenty-year-old man with good passive Tayap but
limited active command of the language – uses tail-head linkage in fifty percent of
his clause conjunctions. Compare this with between roughly ten to twelve percent
in Texts 1–3, which were narrated by more fluent speakers.
     Subordinate and cosubordinate clauses are beyond the capability of most
Tayap speakers younger than thirty. A few of the most skilled passive active speak-
ers (such as the twenty-five-year-old narrator of Tayap Text 3) can use the subordi-
nating morpheme -re to produce ‘when’ clauses (see lines 26 and 51 in Tayap Text 3).
But hypothetical morphemes – like the counterfactual mood that often accompa-
nies it – are mostly dead, and in fifty five of the fifty six narratives by young people
that I collected in Gapun, there is not a single instance of relativization.8
     Young people’s narratives are strings of events presented paratactically –
X did Y, Z happened, Q did P. Sometimes, the events are narrated with no
clause-linking morphology, as in the following extract, from a narrative told
by a twenty-three-year-old man (hesitations, false starts and interruptions and
encouragements by another speaker have been edited out of this extract):8 The single exception is a complex narrative in flawless Tayap told by a twenty-nine-year-old
young woman named Mbonika Amburi (the same Mbonika who features as a six-year-old girl
in the opening vignette of Kulick 1992). Mbonika is the paradigm example of the passive active
speaker. She never speaks more than a few formulaic phrases of Tayap to anyone, and knowing
her well and seeing her every day, I had come to assume that her command of the vernacular was
minimal. After being astonished by the fluency of her Tayap narrative, I asked her why she never
spoke the language. She is ashamed, she told me. She feared that if she spoke Tayap and said
something wrong, the old people in the village would laugh at her. “They’ll criticize”, she told
me. “They’ll say, ‘You all speak Tok Pisin too much and so you don’t know the vernacular’. For
that reason, I’m ashamed to speak the vernacular” (“Ol bai wokim koments, ‘Tok Pisin i planti na
yupela i no save long tok ples’. Na olsem na mi save sem long tok ples.”)

which are typical of the kinds of errors made by young speakers), note that he
does not use a single coordinating, cosubordinating or subordinating morpheme
throughout this entire stretch of speech. The verb phrases that make up the nar-
rative are simply placed one after the other with no linkage between them. (The
final a of the nonce word taina could be a coordinating morpheme, but this is
hard to know since the word doesn’t mean anything.)
     Much more commonly than simply listing verb phrases one after the other,
young speakers link clauses with the coordinating conjunction -(y)a. Here is an
extract from a narrative about a pig hunt by a twenty-six-year-old man who is one
of the more advanced younger speakers in the village:(9-52)   … Ŋa motɨnɨ warukpeta mbet. Mbeta mborma ndow tankuna anpekuna

9 The correct form is either tanin ‘he saw me’ or tanŋgɨn ‘I saw him’.
10 The speaker wants a non-future verb here – nitukun ‘she made’. But even the progressive verb
he uses is incorrectly inflected. The form he wants is nirkwanuk ‘she was making’.

(see Section 6.1.5). The form he wants is kandukun, not the nonce form he creates
by using the verb root as the basis for the non-future inflection. But regardless of
his difficulty inflecting some verbs, he nevertheless is able to link verb phrases
into a coherent narrative. He does this with a single morphological tool, however:
the coordinating conjunction -(y)a.
     This morpheme has been over-extended in the speech of most young speak-
ers to do the work of all coordinating, cosubordinating and subordinating mor-
phemes. The reason for this over-extension is probably twofold.
     First, -a occurs frequently in Tayap, as a way to link coordinated clauses (see
Section 9.3.1).
     Second, the suffix -a, especially when it appears in speech after verbs ending
in n – verbs like tankun and *andpekun in the narrative above – sounds a lot like
(and behaves syntactically a lot like) Tok Pisin’s conjunction “na”, which means
‘and’. That Tok Pisin is never far from the minds of young Tayap speakers is
evident at the end of the above narrative, when the speaker briefly code-switches
into Tok Pisin, precisely to link two clauses.
     Cosubordinate verbs formed with the multiple suffix, -rar, do not appear in
the narratives I collected from speakers younger than thirty, and verbs formed
with the modifying -ra suffix only occur when they have become lexicalized, in
verbs like worer-ara wok ‘pour’ or wasow-ra wek ‘faint’.
286        9 Simple and complex sentences     The only kind of cosubordinate construction that young speakers do some-
times use is verbs formed with the medial manner suffix -kar. A small number of
verbs recur in the different narratives. These verbs always encode motion, never
process or development, and they are verbs that have probably been lexicalized,
like rar-kar mbot (‘I looked and came’), mar-kar ŋgwok (‘they rowed away’), and
amai-kwar wek (‘I was searching as I came’).
     However, the -kar form remains productive for at least some speakers, who
produced verbs like the following:(9-53) a. mɨri    adu         -kwar *weske
          forest break.irr -mann come_outside.dl
          ‘the two of us came crashing out of the forest’; *weske has no meaning;
          the speaker wants uske, from the verb root aski-.       b. naw           apu          -kwar ŋgwek
          grassland burn.irr -mann come.3pl.r
          ‘they burned and came’; a morphologically correctly formed but
          semantically incorrect verb – the speaker was talking about men
          lighting fire to a grassland to drive game out towards men waiting
          with spears, and she wants otar war-kwar ŋgwek: ‘fire light.irr-mann
          come’; lit. ‘they lit fire while coming’.       c. ŋgat        sene am           -kwar ŋgwek
          cassowary two fight.irr -mann come.3pl.r
          ‘the two cassowaries were fighting with one another as they came’;
          the speaker wants the dual form of ‘come’, weke.","[295, 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304, 305, 306]"
"4.3.1 Functions of the ergative caseIn Tayap, ergative marking is “optional” (Foley 1986: 107; Dixon 1994: 58; McGregor
2010). This is typical in general of those Papuan languages which have an ergative
case (Foley 2000: 374; McGregor 2010: 1616). In many of these languages, ergativity
tends to be associated with a cluster of features, in particular agentivity, control and
animacy – most particularly agentivity, such that a more agentive transitive subject
is more likely to receive ergative case marking than a less agentive transitive subject.
     However in Tayap, as in many other languages, ergativity seems to be sensi-
tive to rather more factors than just agentivity.
     The oldest speakers agree that most utterances that omit the ergative are per-
fectly fine Tayap. Speakers do not reflect on the grammatical role of the ergative
markers; the way they explain them is in terms of utterance length. They say, “if you
want to say it the long way, you say ‘ŋayi’ [i.e. ŋa=yi ‘1sg=erg.f’]. If you want to say
it shorter, you say ‘ŋa’” (“Yu laik skulim, em ‘ŋayi’. Yu laik sotim, bai yu tok ‘ŋa’”).
     The functions of the ergative case in Tayap are rather opaque. The following
contrastive examples are intended to show that ergativity marking does not
equate simply to animacy, agentivity or control.

             ‘I’m hungry (lit. ‘hunger is affecting me’). You all make some sago jelly’The ergative is frequently used when the arguments of a verb are both animate,
and both present in the clause. In those instances, ergative marking is used to
clearly distinguish the subject of a transitive verb from its object.
    For example, the following sentence is ambiguous:(4-29) ŋɨ ŋgat poŋgɨn
       ŋɨ       ŋgat        po        -ŋgɨ        -n
       3sg.m cassowary strike.r -3sg.m.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
       ‘he speared the cassowary’ or ‘the cassowary stabbed him’ (with its claws)Speakers would normally interpret the fact that the pronoun ‘he’ occurs in the
sentence-initial position as indicating that ‘he’, and not ‘the cassowary’, is the
agent in this sentence. But without ergative marking the phrase is ambiguous,
and older fluent speakers say that it is poor Tayap.
    The reasons for the ambiguity are:
(a) the class 1 transitive verb o means ‘strike’ or ‘shoot’, and here it could mean
     either ‘penetrate or pierce with a spear’ or ‘penetrate or pierce with a sharp
     claw’; and
(b) cassowaries are typically gendered masculine, so the 3sg.m object suffix on
     the verb can refer to either a male person or a cassowary.","[132, 133, 134, 135]"
"1.3 Material on which this book is basedI first went to Gapun in the mid-1980s, at the suggestion of Don Laycock. I was
interested in studying language shift in a place where the accounts usually
offered to explain it – urbanization, social class mobility, educational aspira-
tions – might not apply. I wanted to work on language shift in Papua New Guinea
because I assumed that the tiny languages spoken there might be undergoing
change. Nothing was known about the situation for Tayap, but Don had always
remained curious about the language, and he reasoned cheerfully that “it’s so
small that something has to be happening to it”. So off I went.
     After a one-month reconnaissance trip to Gapun in 1985, I returned a year
later and spent fifteen months in the village, gathering data on the language
and on language use. During that period, I worked a great deal with senior men,
14       1 The Tayap language and its speakersespecially Raya Ayarpa and his older brother, Kruni Ayarpa. Both brothers had
been born in the late 1920s. They had been initiated in the traditional men’s
house cult of the tambaran, they were regarded as experts on traditional knowl-
edge and history, and they were fluent and eloquent speakers of Tayap. They were
members of the last generation to have had direct contact with the pre-colonial
customs of their ancestors, either through their own experiences or through the
stories of their fathers, grandfathers and other kinfolk.
     I left Gapun in 1987 and wrote my PhD thesis on the social and cultural under-
pinnings of the language shift that was occurring there. A few years later, the
thesis was published (Kulick 1992). I returned in 1991 to systematize my linguistic
data with the goal of writing a grammar and dictionary. But that fieldtrip was cut
short by a tragedy that occurred two months into the work: late one night, a group
of armed bandits (called ol raskol, ‘rascals’, throughout Papua New Guinea) snuck
into the village and attacked me in my house. They had been drawn to Gapun by
a rumor that I was keeping 40,000 kina (the Papua New Guinean currency; at the
time this was worth about the same in US dollars) in a metal patrol box.
     In the tumult that occurred during the attack, the raskols shot a man – one
of old Kruni Ayarpa’s adult sons, Kawri Kruni – and he died shortly afterwards in
the arms of the horrified villagers.
     After murdering Kawri, the raskols fled Gapun. I left too, partly out of concern
for my own safety, but also feeling that my presence in the village had come to
be a dangerous liability for the villagers. My own trauma and sorrow regarding
the incident led me to abandon my work on Gapun and the Tayap language (this
incident and its aftermath is described in detail in Kulick 2019).
     I did not return to Gapun again until fifteen years later, in 2006. During a
short trip, I determined that the general law and order situation in that part of
Papua New Guinea had improved, and also that the villagers were eager for me
to come back. I applied for and received several research grants, and in 2009, I
returned to Gapun and spent nine months in the village.
     By this time, all the senior men with whom I had worked in the 1980s were
long dead, and in fact, as I noted above, there remained only a few villagers who
were over sixty years old. I began working on the language with one of them,
Monei Mbanaŋ, a perceptive and gentle man in his mid-sixties with whom I had
done a great deal of transcription work in the 1980s.
     Unfortunately, two months after I arrived in Gapun, Monei grew gravely ill
with what looked to me like cerebral malaria, and he died several weeks later.
     Monei’s death turned out to be a devastating blow to Gapun. Everyone in the
village mourned the loss of their “last big man”, as they all called Monei. But that
mourning was riddled with conflict. Monei’s adult children openly accused their
maternal cousins of having paid a sorcerer to kill their father. Those accusations
                                           Material on which this book is based    15
reignited long-smoldering hostilities. They led to village-wide brawls between dif-
ferent kin groups, and to uncontrolled drinking by young men, who a few years pre-
viously had been taught by men from the Sepik river village of Bien how to ferment
and distill alcohol from coconut water or rotten bananas. The village was riven with
threats of revenge sorcery, and by almost daily recurring uproar and violence that set
everyone on edge. Social control collapsed and villagers’ sense of cohesion frayed.
     In the months following Monei’s death, there was a powder-keg atmosphere
in the village, and many villagers came to grow tired of hiding inside their houses
while drunken young men strode though the village brandishing machetes,
screaming obscenities in Tok Pisin and challenging others to come and fight with
them. People began talking of “running away” from Gapun, and some families
did actually abandon their houses and leave the village to build small home-
steads for themselves in the jungle. By the end of 2009, when I left Gapun, the
village was in the process of fissuring.
     During this unsettling time, I collected material on Tayap by working with two
other speakers. My chief language informant was Samek Wanjo, a pensive man
who, in 2009, was about sixty years old. After Monei’s death, Samek assumed
Monei’s place as the village’s “biggest” man, and everyone agreed that he was
one of the few remaining villagers who possessed any significant knowledge of
traditions, land rights and village history.
     The other person with whom I worked on Tayap was Ŋgero Sair, a thirty-
five-year-old woman who is the oldest daughter of two Tayap-dominant parents.
Ŋgero is one of the youngest speakers in Gapun to habitually use Tayap in her
everyday conversations, and I was eager to work with her, to try to gauge any dif-
ferences which might exist between her competence in Tayap, and that of older
speakers. Samek and Ŋgero both turned out to be knowledgeable and nimble lan-
guage informants.
     With Samek I worked on vocabulary and grammar. With Ŋgero, I transcribed
most of the recordings I made of naturally occurring speech.
     In 1993, my linguist colleague Christopher Stroud and I published a thir-
ty-page sketch grammar of Tayap in a volume honoring Don Laycock, who died
suddenly in 1988, and whose passing was a profound loss for Papuan linguistics.
Much of the analysis in that short sketch grammar is reasonable, as a first attempt
to come to terms with the basic structure of the language (Kulick and Stroud 1993).
     But re-reading the paper, I realized that it is an unhappily difficult text to
process. Christopher and I wrote the sketch for linguists, and we were interested
in facilitating the identification of underlying forms of the grammatical structures
we discussed. It strikes me now that this goal – or certainly the way we tried to
achieve it – obscures more about the language than it illuminates. For that reason,
Angela Terrill and I have completely overhauled the analysis of Tayap presented
16         1 The Tayap language and its speakersin that paper, and we have not concerned ourselves with any attempt to identify
or derive underlying forms. Anyone who might be interested in analyzing those
forms – for example to determine Tayap’s genetic relationships with other lan-
guages – should find sufficient material in this grammar and dictionary to do so.3
     The data on which this grammar and dictionary are based consists of mate-
rial elicited during the following visits to Gapun: 1985 (one month), 1986–1987
(fifteen months), 1991 (two months), 2006 (six weeks), 2009 (nine months), 2010
(one month), and 2014 (two and a half months).4 The book is also based on tran-
scripts of naturally occurring talk that I made during all those periods of field-
work. Those transcripts represent over one hundred hours of audio-taped talk in
all kinds of situations – interactions between caregivers and children, oratories
in the men’s house, domestic arguments, harangues, narratives, village meetings
and tuneful weeping over corpses.
     All transcribed talk was written down with the help of village informants. I
could never have transcribed the language by myself. At its apogee, my passive
command of Tayap was respectable, and after about five months in the village
in 2009, for example, I was able to follow most of what was said in the ver-
nacular. But like village children and young adults, I never needed to actively
speak Tayap – except, that is, when people from other villages came to Gapun to
visit. Then, inevitably and to my great exasperation, Gapuners would ignore my4 A brief visit to Gapun in March 2019 determined that there is no longer any there there. The vil-
lage has been all but abandoned. Fewer than fifty people (of which thirty were adults) were living
in Gapun – this, out of total population of more than two hundred people five years earlier, in 2014.
Much of the village had been reclaimed by jungle. Eight houses (the entire upper third section of
the village) were incinerated in 2018, during a fight, and the victims of this violence have fled into
the rainforest and built new houses there. Other villagers have taken their families and relocated to
other villages, such as neighboring Wongan, or the coastal villages of Watam and Boroi.
    The reason for the village’s dissolution is that the disruptive binge drinking that began in
earnest in 2009 has continued, and wrought devastation. Young village men have begun mur-
dering one another in drunken frenzies. In December 2013, a village man was shot in the stomach
with an arrow during a drunken brawl. He died an agonizing death a few days later. In August
2018, again during a drunken melee, a young man was shot in the head with a cruelly barbed
projectile. Relatives managed to get him to a hospital in the tiny town of Angoram (a twelve hour
journey away, paddling in a canoe), and the staff there managed to remove the projectile, but the
man suffered severe cognitive impairments and he died a month later.
    I am at a loss to imagine how the cycle of drinking and violence might be brought to an end,
since murders like the ones that occurred in 2013 and 2018 only intensify the ever-more-destruc-
tive spirals of conflict that have steadily been poisoning village life for the past ten years.
    In addition to resulting in unnumbered tears and profound tragedy, the dispersion of Gapun
village reduces interpersonal contact between individual villagers, and it inevitably will impact
on Tayap, undoubtedly hastening its demise.

mous pleasure in showing off their resident white man, and they delighted in the
fact that I was able to awe their easily impressed guests with my ability to respond
to commands in Tayap and mouth a few simple phrases.

3.1.3.1 Gender marking
Gender in Tayap is a property of nouns, but is a morphologically covert category.
It is not marked not on the noun itself, but is expressed on the following targets:
(1) deixis markers (see Section 3.8); and/or
(2) ergative markers on the subjects of transitive verbs (see Section 4.3); and/or
(3) suffixes on the verb that encode subject and object (See Sections 3.5 and 5.3);
      and/or
(4) suppletive verb stems (see Chapter 6)For example, compare the following intransitive constructions:(3-16) a. noŋor aŋgi patɨrnɨ wuk
          noŋor    aŋgi patɨr =nɨ     wuk
          woman dx.f house =loc be.3sg.f.r
          ‘the woman is in the house’       b. munje ainde patɨrnɨ kut
          munje ainde patɨr =nɨ     kut
          man    dx.m house =loc be.sg.m.r
          ‘the man is in the house’Here, the gender of the subjects is expressed by both the deictic words (aŋgi/
ainde) and the gender of the inflected verb aku ‘be’ (wuk ‘she is’ versus kut
‘he is’).
     Transitive verbs mark gender in object suffixes (see Section 3.5). Some classes
of transitive verbs (classes 4 and 5) signal gender and number on the subject suf-
fix(es) as well. So compare the following non-future forms of the class 4 verb ŋgar
‘call out to’:(3-17) a. ŋɨŋi ŋgu ŋganukun
          ŋɨ=ŋi           ŋgu    ŋga   -nu -ku         -n
          3sg.m=erg.m 3sg.f call_out.r -s  <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
          ‘he called out to her’
                                                                       Nouns        57
       b. ŋguyi ŋgu ŋgatukun
          ŋgu     =yi       ŋgu   ŋga   -tu -ku        -n
          3sg.f =erg.f 3sg.f call_out.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
          ‘she called out to her’In both examples, the object suffix -ku signals a feminine object (a masculine
object would be -ŋgɨ; see Section 5.3.1). But in a class 4 verb like ŋgar, the gender
and number of the subject is also obligatorily marked: in this example, gender is
encoded in the alternation between -nu + -n (combining to signal 1sg or 3sg.m or
1pl), and -tu + -n (combining to signal 2sg or 3sg.f).
    Notice also the different ergative markers affixed to 3sg.m (=ŋi) and 3sg.f (=yi).
    Other verbs (conjugation class 3 transitive verbs and some intransitive verbs)
also change their stem forms to signal the gender of the subject:(3-18) a. mbori pap okun
          mbor=i      pap         o      -ku      -n
          pig=erg.f coconut consume.r <3sg.f.r.o> -3sg.f.r.s
          ‘the (female) pig ate coconut’       b. mborŋi pap kakun
          mbor =ŋi       pap    ka        -ku
          pig    =erg.m coconut consume.r <3sg.f.r.o>           -n
           -1sg|2sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
           ‘the (male) pig ate coconut’Here, again, the object suffix -ku signals a feminine object, ‘coconut’, and thus
remains the same in both sentences. But the verb ‘consume’ (a) is a conjugation
class 3 transitive verb, and in those verbs, the verb stem changes to signal the gender
(and number) of the subject, alternating between o and ka (see Section 6.1.4).
    This verb-stem alternation is a source of serious difficulty for young speakers
of Tayap, as is discussed in Section 6.1.5.","[76, 77]"
"
Tayap has a six-way distinction for singular referents – three for feminine ref-
erents and three for masculine referents. As in other parts of Tayap grammar,
the gender distinction collapses in the plural, and here the language maintains a
two-way distinction:

Note that the three-way distance distinction in the singular and two-way in the
plural is highly unusual and may in fact be a simplification: the middle term in
the singular could in fact be a close-to-addressee term or expressing other prag-
matic factors (see e.g. Wilkins 1999).5
     In addition to the words listed above, Tayap also has a number of slightly
different deictic words. They are as follows:
Feminine               Masculine                       Pluralaŋgok…aŋgo             aindet….ende ‘this …here’

aŋgudek…aŋgu           ‘that…there’                    aŋgɨb… aŋgɨb ‘those…
‘that…there’                                           there’The first or second words in these pairs can occur alone functioning as an argu-
ment of a verb phrase. During a disagreement between two men, for example, one
protagonist responded to the other’s threats to come and beat him up with the
dismissive snort addressed to everybody who was listening:6(3-84) aindetŋike oyin?
       aindet      =ŋi       =ke o          -yi -n?
       that_one =erg.m =q strike.irr -1sg.irr.o -sg|1pl.irr.s
       ‘that one there is going to hit me?’These topicalizing deictic words often co-occur, sometimes multiple times in an
utterance.7 They can be post-posed to a noun to emphasize it, for example in
response to a question like ‘Who did it?’:5 We thank Anna Margetts for this observation.
6 The second word here, ende, can also be realized as inde, ide or de
7 It is possible that these instances might more felicitously be labeled “focusing”, “highlight-
ing” or “emphasizing” rather than topicalizing (Reesink 2014). More information and analysis
on the functions of all these deicitics is needed.
                                                                Deictics (dx)     95

          dx.m man         dx.m crazy     dx.m
          ‘this man is crazy’A third set of related deictic words are demonstrative identifiers, which indicate
particularity and presence, e.g. ‘it’s me’, or ‘I’m here’ (as opposed to being away
somewhere). The term “demonstrative identifiers” comes from Diessel (1999).
These words function in a similar way to how an adverb like ecco functions in the
Italian eccomi – ‘it’s me’ or ‘here I am’. So the most common response to a ques-
tion like ‘Who are you?’ – asked, for example when one hears someone approach-
ing in the pitch blackness of a moonless night – is Ŋa ainda (‘it’s me’).    ainda    used with ŋa (1sg.m and 1sg.f)
                       yu (2sg.m and 2sg.f)
                       yim (1pl)
                       yum (2pl)
    ainde    used with ŋɨ (3sg.m)
    aŋgo(de) used with ŋgu (3sg.f)
    aŋge(de) used with ŋgɨ (3sg.pl) and dlThese words are virtually obligatory with many verbs, such as aku ‘be’, in the
sense that even though it would be grammatically correct to just say ŋɨ kut (‘he’s
here’), it is pragmatically awkward. One should say ŋɨ ainde kut (‘he dx.m is here’).
    Finally, in addition to all the deictic forms listed above, Tayap also has a
quasi-deictic suffix -me, which means ‘yes, indeed, that one (or those) as opposed
to any other or others’, occurring on pronouns.
    -me is also used to emphasize a referent, for example:(3-87) a. ŋgɨme aŋgi ŋgwokara
          ŋgɨ -me aŋgi ŋgwok          -ara
          3pl -dx dx.pl go.3pl.r -perf
          ‘they’re indeed the ones who left’ (as opposed to some other people

heard phrases in Tayap: ŋguméŋgi. This phrase – a contracted form of ŋgu-me aŋgi
(3sg.f-me + aŋgi) – means ‘yes, that way’, ‘that’s right’ (“em nau” in Tok Pisin).","[113, 114, 115, 116]"

expresses a desire that some action be performed by someone else or something
else. Here the subjunctive occurs in the “desire” clause, after an expression of
cognition in the main clause. It is the appearance of the verb in its subjunctive
form that generates the meaning of the verb in the main clause as one of desire,
rather than cognition.(7-19) a. ŋa numbwan pikun ŋɨ onet Merewre

212        7 MoodThis construction using an expression of cognition in the main clause and a sub-
junctive in the subordinate clause is unusual – examples (7-19a) and (7-19b) are
from elicitation sessions with senior men in the 1980s. I have not encountered
this construction in any of the conversations or speeches that I have transcribed.
Instead, desire predicates are constructed in one of two ways, none of them
involving the subjunctive.
     The first way of forming a desire predicate is with the verb phrase ‘arei + erga-
tive + tar’, which literally means ‘desire takes’. This is a moribund construction:
like examples (7-19a-b) above, my only recorded instances of it are in elicitation
sessions in the 1980s with senior informants.
     The construction is realized without overt marking on the main clause, and
the verb in the subordinate clause is inflected for future tense:(7-20) ŋɨ areiyi tatɨŋgɨn ŋa okɨnet Potowre
       ŋɨ       arei     =yi        ta     -tɨ   -ŋgɨ        -n

       1sg go.irr -irr -1sg.m|3sg.m.r Wongan =all
       ‘he wants me to go to Wongan’ (lit. ‘desire takes him, I will go to Wongan’)The most common way to express the desire that someone or something else do
something that you want is to use the verb nam, which has the primary meaning
of ‘talk’ or ‘tell’, but which is also used to mean ‘think’ (this kind of semantic
conflation between verbs like “talk”, “tell”, “think” and “desire” is common in
Papuan languages; Reesink 1993).
     Desire predicates with nam are constructed the same way as the example
above, that is to say with the verb in the subordinate clause inflected in the future
tense. Speakers also often use the adverb nande ‘thusly’ to draw attention to the
verb of desire, producing sentences like the following:(7-21) ŋa nande namnet yu okɨtet Ombágire
       ŋa nande nam -net                   yu o    -kɨ  -tet

7.2 Prohibitive (proh)In contrast to the imperative mood, which expresses the speaker’s command for
the addressee to perform a particular action, the prohibitive is a command to not
perform an action. It can be translated as ‘Don’t do X’, ‘Don’t dare do X’ or ‘X is
prohibited’. The prohibitive cannot be negated. It is formed as follows:    person
    ŋa ‘I’
    yu ‘you’
                                  irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgarke
    ŋgu ‘she’
    ŋɨ ‘he’
    yim ‘we’    yum ‘you pl’     →            irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgremke
    ŋgɨ ‘they’       →            irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgroke
    dl               →            irr verb root + (ben r object) + -ŋgrekeIf a speaker includes the benefactive object in this construction, the action is
marked as ongoing, in the progressive aspect, so it means ‘Don’t be doing X!’(7-22) a. emarar -ŋgarke!
          play.irr -proh.sg|1pl
          ‘you can’t play!’ or ‘it’s forbidden to play!’; said for example to a child

           ‘you can’t be here!’7.3 Admonitive (adm)A structure that is morphologically almost identical to the prohibitive occurs in
the modal construction that expresses the non-desirability of an action.
     This modality in Tayap has its exact equivalent in the Tok Pisin expression
“nogut X”, where X denotes an action that the speaker doesn’t want to happen,
regrets happening, is uncertain has happened or will happen, or when the speaker
anticipates or senses that something undesirable will ensue from the action’s
occurrence. This is a difficult expression to translate, because it can be a warning,
as in ‘X better not happen/have happened’; a negative hope, as in ‘I hope X doesn’t
happen’ (or, ‘I hoped X wouldn’t happen’); a concern, as in ‘May X not happen’; or
a meditation, like ‘What if X should happen?’. The admonitive cannot be negated.
     In Tayap, this construction differs from the prohibitive only in that the final
-ke of the prohibitive markers is -ana in the admonitive, and that there is no ben-
efactive in it:      person
      ŋa ‘I’
      yu ‘you’
                                 irr verb root + -ŋgarana

      yim ‘we’
      yum ‘you pl’      →        irr verb root + -ŋgremana
      ŋgɨ ‘they’        →        irr verb root + -ŋgroana
      dl                →        irr verb root + -ŋgreanaExamples:(7-23) a. ror     aŋgu eiar         -ŋgarana

          who is talking                 better not talk’; said to someone who
                                         knows a secret about another person
                                         and is going to visit that person; the
                                         speaker is expressing the hope that
                                         the person addressed won’t open his
                                         or her mouth and spill the beans7.4 Intentional (intent)The intentional mood expresses two kinds of events. The first is actions that are
or were intended or desired but that have not been completed or that didn’t occur
or won’t occur. The second kind of event expressed by the intentional mood is an
inevitable action: an action that often, in retrospect, ended in a foreseeable way.
    An example of this latter sense is the response of a woman seeing a photograph I
had taken of a gravely ill Monei Mbanaŋ; he had been sick for weeks and I photographed
him as he was about to be carried to a canoe and taken to a hospital, where he died a
few days later. Upon seeing this photograph months after Monei had died, looking at
a desiccated and paralyzed Monei, this woman murmured waso-kɨ-nana (die.irr-irr-
intent) ‘he’s about to/intending to die’, in a soft, rising voice expressing sorrow.
    The intentional mood was mentioned earlier in the section on the near future
tense (5.4.2.3) because it is constructed in a similar way, with the bound morpheme
216        7 Mood-ana (-nana after a vowel; this form is often reduced and realized as -na) affixed
directly to the irrealis object marker (for transitive verbs) or directly to the irrealis
marker -ki-, -kɨ- or -ku- (for intransitive verbs). So the structure is as follows:transitive verbs       irr verb stem + irr object + -(n)anaintransitive verbs     irr verb stem + irr morpheme + -(n)anaExamples of the intentional mood are:(7-25) a. ewar ŋa sokoi akrunana, sokoi wákare

struction means that it can also be translated as ‘in order to’ or ‘with the intention
of’, as in the following, consisting of two juxtaposed main clauses:

suffix cannot be negated. Instead negative intention is expressed by negating

Don’s Acknowledgements:
The research on which this book is based was made possible by generous research
grants by the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Wenner-Gren Founda-
tion for Anthropological Research, the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foun-
dation and the Swedish Research Council. I am grateful to my former employer,
the University of Chicago, for granting me the research leave that allowed me
to return to Gapun and conduct fieldwork for nine months during 2009, and for
leave to visit Gapun for several months in 2010, 2012 and 2014. I am grateful to my
current employer, Uppsala University, for leave to travel to the town of Madang in
order to complete the final draft of this book in spring 2018.
     In Papua New Guinea, I thank James Robins and Georgia Kaipu, of Papua
New Guinea’s National Research Institute, for their impressive skill in negotiat-
ing the bureaucracy involved in obtaining a research visa. I owe a large debt to
Divine Word University in the town of Madang, which generously provided me
with a place to live while I worked on the final version of this text. The late Nancy
Sullivan, whose feisty and festive presence in Madang was instrumental in luring
me back to Papua New Guinea after an absence of fifteen years, is deeply, sorely
missed. Other people in Madang whose company and support I value are John
Mackerell, John Burton, Pam Norman, Cecilia Nembou, Fidelma Takaili, Iwona
Kolodziejczyk, Gert van den Berg, Patricia Paraide, David Lloyd, Edwina Jangi,
Sr. Miriam Dlugosz, and Frs. Philip Gibbs, Patrick Gesch, and Garrett Roche.
     I am grateful to several colleagues who generously provided me with
support over the years. Many years ago, Christopher Stroud worked with me to
make initial sense of Tayap, and I gratefully acknowledge his contributions to
my understanding of the language. Eva Lindström shared much appreciated
pre-fieldwork technical advice about audio recorders, Toughbook computers and
solar panels. Two stays at ANU in Australia, one of them as a visiting fellow at
ANU’s Humanities Research Centre, facilitated by Nick Evans and Alan Rumsey,
were extremely important in the development of this text. Andy Pawley gave me
very helpful advice in relation to the dictionary, which he read through with care.
Nick Evans provided important encouragement and perspicacious suggestions
about the analysis at several crucial points when I felt stuck.
     I am grateful to Bill Foley for reading the entire first draft of the grammar and
providing invaluable feedback.
     I want to take this opportunity to explicitly acknowledge the work of my
co-author, Angela Terrill. Upon receiving the reader’s report from an anony-
mous reviewer that I got back from Pacific Linguistics the first time I submitted
the manuscript in 2011, I recognized that I needed a trained descriptive linguist
https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-201
VIII      Acknowledgementsto help me transform the grammar into publishable form. In 2017, I contacted
Angela, who through sheer serendipity happened to be living in Uppsala, the city
in Sweden where I am employed. Angela accepted my invitation to work with
my manuscript, and remarkably, she managed to acquire a feel for Tayap – its
idiosyncrasies and its genius – after only a few months. Angela’s incisive inter-
ventions, her continual exhortations that “we need more examples”, her exten-
sive knowledge of Papuan linguistics, and her clear head and good cheer are the
reason why this grammar and dictionary is now finally seeing the light of day.
     My greatest debt, obviously, is to the people of Gapun, whom I have known
now for over three decades. Villagers have always seen to it that I have had a
house to live in (three times, in 1987, 1991 and 2009, they have built me a house),
and food to eat. My debt to them is a collective one, and this documentation of
their vernacular language is one way I hope they will sense some repayment of
that debt. Many of the people who worked with me on the intricacies of the Tayap
language are no longer alive, among them my chief language informants in the
1980s, Raya Ayarpa, Kruni Ayarpa and Mukar Raya. In 2009, I worked most inten-
sively on the language with Monei Mbanaŋ, Samek Wanjo and Ŋgero Sair, all of
whom were remarkable teachers. Others to whom I am especially grateful for my
stay in Gapun in 2009 are Mbaso Monei who allowed me to live in a room in his
house when I arrived in Gapun, and his older brother, the village komiti at the
time, Opɨ Monei who organized, cajoled and supervised much of the labor that
eventually built my house.
     My greatest single debt during my months in Gapun since I began returning
in 2006 after a fifteen-year absence is to those two men’s younger sister, Ndamor
Monei her husband Mbanu Ajiragi and the couple’s seven sassy children Mbobot,
Mopok, Poniker, Ŋawr, Ŋgayam, Kape and Kaŋirase. The house that villagers built
me in 2009 was in the center of Gapun, right next to Ndamor’s house. Without
anyone ever asking her to do so, Ndamor quietly took it upon herself to make sure
that I was always fed, and she and her daughters kept the area surrounding my
house clean and free from dog feces and pig droppings. Ndamor has one of the
most raucous senses of humor in the village, and now in her mid-forties, she is
also one of the few women in Gapun who still has ferocious and poetic kros-es
(harangues of anger) in Tayap. I loved both her humor and her anger – some of
the most imaginative obscenities quoted in this book are Ndamor’s. Living right
next to Ndamor, in full hearing of everything that went on in her house at all
hours of the day and night, was continually enlightening and hugely entertain-
ing. Whenever I feel nostalgic for Gapun, it is my time spent listening to Ndamor
and talking and laughing with her and her family that I miss the most.
     I am grateful to the librarians in Kungliga Biblioteket in Stockholm, who pro-
vided me with a forskarplats in the reading room, where I was able to sit and

write the entire first draft of this book in brisk enforced silence. I also thank the
Ingmar Bergman Estate for a week long residency in August 2018. There I had the
enormous privilege of putting the final touches on this manuscript sitting at the
writing desk of the great auteur himself.
    Finally, I thank Jonas Tillberg, for support, affection and the helicopter.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"
"3.10.1 Sounds used for calling animals and babiesVillagers also have distinctive ways of calling a number of animals and to amuse
or distract pre-verbal babies:      to call a pig                   close mouth, repeatedly make a sound like
                                      clearing the throat
      to call a puppy                 /‖/ – alveolar lateral click made with rounded lips
      to call a grown dog             short brisk whistle held over one beat, repeated
                                      many times
      to call a cat                   wsi-wsi-wsi-wsi
      to call a chicken               tu-tu-tu-tu-tu (high pitched)
      to get a baby’s attention       repeated kissing sounds
      to distract a crying baby       blow air through closed lips3.11 Intensifiers and discourse markersA number of words and suffixes in Tayap have no referential meaning. They func-
tion to draw attention to or emphasize the word they follow. So an angry shout
of ayáta! ‘enough!’ followed by the word kai expresses stronger disapproval than
ayáta without the kai.
     A second group of words function as ways for speakers to do things like plan
discourse, stress particular constituents, hedge and change topics.
     Tayap’s intensifiers and discourse markers are as follows
                                           Intensifiers and discourse markers   101
3.11.1 Intensifierskai intensifier used only with the command ayáta ‘stop it’. Kai may be
    a short form of kaitkait, which means ‘rotten shit’, and is used in
    censorious abuse.(3-91) ayáta kai manɨŋg imin anem ayáta
       ayáta kai         manɨŋg imin anem            ayáta!
       stop it intens bucket belly poss.pl stop it
       You all better really stop this habit of sitting with stuffed stomachs!
       (manɨŋg imin is a euphemism for yɨwɨr imin, which means ‘shit belly’, i.e.
       a belly filled up with feces because one has eaten so much. The speaker
       here is chastising his relatives, saying that they eat well but never feed
       him, and that such behavior must stop)arɨk   intensifier used only with mokop/mosop ‘little’(3-92) mosop arɨk ŋayi ainɨ ŋguratmborinŋgɨn andnɨ kararneta mbot inde

       ‘when he was really little I knocked him down like this and made him
       writhe and he went (away) covered red in blood’mɨr    intensifier used to emphasize the size or quality of the noun or noun
       phrase that it follows:(3-93) a. yu ambinana otar suman mɨr aŋgo nitukun?
          yu ambinana otar suman mɨr            aŋgo

          ‘the water is really, really cold’
102        3 Word classesapro negative intensifier used in the context of abuse to mean something like
sakar English ‘fucking’:(3-94) a. ŋare takwattakwatŋgarke koret ror apro sakar morasi aproŋa!
          ŋa =re      takwat -takwat -ŋgarke koret

            ‘Stop lying to me! You’re like a fucking foreigner with bad habits’ (i.e.
            you don’t treat me like a fellow villager and tell me the truth)        b. tokinema manŋa ŋgwab sawir manŋa apro sakar!

           catfish=poss cunt=poss hole          black cunt=poss bad intens
           ‘Catfish cunt, fucking black cunt hole!’This intensifier also appears to have had a plural form: in 1991, I recorded a single
instance of the following, in the speech of a woman then in her mid-forties:        c. Sakema sumannɨ aŋgurem aprɨ sakrem!
           Sake=ma       suman=nɨ a          -ŋgurem aprɨ         sakrem

           ‘You’re all fucking being supported by Sake!’ (lit. ‘being on Sake’s
           strength/bigness’)-kɨ     intensifier affixed to adverbs, used to emphasize them (see also
        Section 3.4.2):(3-95) tandiwkɨ sirétet

       ‘descend really well’ (said to someone walking down the steep notched
       poles that lead up into houses)-nɨ     like -kɨ, but used more rarely, an intensifier affixed to adverbs, used to
        emphasize them (see also Section 3.4.2):(3-96) aro sami ŋa rarŋgankut ŋɨ tutorŋayornɨawkut

3.11.2 Discourse markersŋgo      carries the sense of ‘well then’ or ‘in that case’ (cf. Tok Pisin:
         “pastaim”), e.g.:(3-97) Speaker A:
       ŋa nda okɨnetana ŋgo
       ŋa nda o             -kɨ   -net     -ana    ŋgo

       ‘Well, I’m going to go then’         Speaker B:
         otet ŋgo!
         o       -tet       ŋgo!
         go.sbj -2sg.m.r dm
         ‘Go, then/in that case’ndɨ      discourse marker that draws attention to the noun phrase that precedes
         it. It conveys the gentle nuance that whatever precedes it is known
         or should be known by the addressee. Its meaning therefore extends
         from what one might translate as ‘you know’, ‘right’ or ‘so’, to more
         exasperated nuances like ‘in case you weren’t paying attention’ or ‘you
         perhaps don’t know, but now I’m telling you’. An example expressing
         impatience is as follows:(3-98) tukur non      ndɨ we                -tak
       rain some dm come.sbj                -2sg.f.r
       ‘Come on rain, come!’Another typical example that acknowledges previously conveyed information,
and that also might be interpreted as displaying some impatience, is the following:
(3-99)   Speaker A: ŋa kebis katɨpkrunetana
                    ŋa kebis
                    1sg lettuce (TP)                        katɨp         -kru          -net           -ana
                        cut_up.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s -intent
                        ‘I’m going to go cut up lettuce’
104       3 Word classes        Speaker B: yu ndɨ katɨptukun
                   yu ndɨ katɨp      -tu -ku        -n
                   2sg dm cut_up.sbj -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
                   ‘So cut it then’        When ndɨ occurs in a sentence that has at least one verb inflected in
        the counterfactual mood, it also functions syntactically as a marker of
        subordination (see Section 9.4.2).nda    discourse marker that is likely a reduced form of the deictic morpheme
       ainda (see Section 3.8). Used like ndɨ to draw attention to the noun or noun
       phrase that precedes it, and often carries a sense similar to English ‘then’:(3-100) mboka ŋa nda numbwan aproyi tatin
        mbok           -a   ŋa nda numbwan apro =yi
        go.1sg.f|1pl.r -and 1sg dm thought bad =erg.f        ta     -t -i         -n
        get.r -s <1sg.r.o> -2sg.|.f3sg.f|1pl.r.s
        ‘we went along and then a bad thought occurred to me’ (lit. ‘a bad
        thought got me’)In a way that is similar to and probably related to the pragmatic function of
Tayap’s deictic words (see Section 3.8), discourse markers frequently occur multi-
ple times in a single sentence, as in the following:(3-101) a. ŋa ndɨ nda namnak Ŋgemanŋi mera
           ŋa ndɨ nda nam -nak                  Ŋgeman =ŋi mera
           1sg dm dm talk.r -1sg.f|1pl.r Ŋgeman =erg.m supp
           ‘I thought it was Ŋgeman (who did it)’        b. yum nda mbor ndɨ ŋayi kirawkru ŋgo wákare
           yum nda mbor ndɨ ŋa =yi kiraw                -kru          ŋgo wákare
           2pl dm pig dm 1sg =erg know.irr -3sg.f.irr.o dm neg
           ‘Well you all, I really don’t know anything about that pig’3.12 Mood particlesTayap has four freestanding words that express expectation (awa), supposition
(mera), mirative (kapa) and surprise counter to expectation (nímera). These are
discussed in Section 7.6.
4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers,
  case marking and possession4.1 IntroductionNoun phrases function as arguments of verbs: A, S, O and peripheral roles. Noun
phrase function is expressed with clitics marking A. O and S arguments are
unmarked, and oblique arguments are marked by clitics.
     This chapter first discusses noun phrase structure, with a discussion of mod-
ifiers of the head noun. This is followed by a discussion of each case marker:
ergative, locative, ablative, perlative and dative. After this comes a description of
possession in Tayap. Young people’s Tayap is discussed in relation to ergativity
(Section 4.3.2) and peripheral case markers (Section 4.6).","[120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125]"
"
2 Semantic error: the verb nam- ‘tell’ is incorrect here; the speaker wants kotar-(p)-e- ‘ask’.
   Grammatical errors: the speaker omits the ergative clitic on the subject of the verb, and also
omits a locative case marker on Yengia, the undergoer of the verb. The grammatically correct way
of phrasing the question is:      ŋayar=ke yu=yi            morasi apro Yengia=nɨ    ni-tu-ku-n?
      true=q        2sg=erg.f deed      bad Yengia=loc do.r-s<3sg.f.r.o>2sg|3sg.f.r.s
      ‘Is it true that you did something bad to Yengia?’
                                                                 Peripheral cases           121
4.4 Peripheral casesTayap has five peripheral cases. Three of the cases mark animate and inanimate
referents differently.
     The possessive case marks possession, association and part-whole rela-
tionships, with no distinction between alienable and inalienable possession.
Possession is discussed in Section 4.5.
     The locative case has the widest semantic scope of Tayap’s peripheral cases. It
specifies location in time and space, covering relationships that in other languages
are expressed in allative, instrumental, comitative, temporal and durative cases.
     The ablative case expresses movement away from a person, place or object,
or an action of revelation in which something that was hidden becomes visible.
     The perlative case expresses movement along, through or by means of.
     The dative case is used to mark recipient, purpose, comparison and a number
of other relations.
     All these peripheral case markers are clitics, as they occur attached to the last
element of an NP with scope over the whole NP: see for example (4-40i), (4-40j),
(4-42b), (4-43d), (4-43i), among others. Many of them contain optional material
(shown in parentheses), the conditioning factors of which are not known.
Examples (the relevant peripheral case clitics are in bold):

130        4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possession4.5 PossessionPossession is marked by a possessive clitic on the possessor. Possessor clitics
mark higher animate singular (=ma), higher animate plural (=mandama) and
inanimate (=ŋa) possessors. Note also that Tayap has external possession con-
structions, discussed in Section 7.5 in the section on benefactives.
     This clitic is also used to form relative clauses (Section 9.5), finite nominaliza-
tions (Section 9.6) and perception clauses (Section 9.7).
     Example (4-44) shows the possessive clitic marking an NP consisting of a
modified noun ‘cold belly’, thus demonstrating the clitic rather than affix status
of these forms:animate plural inalienable:(4-44)   imin pokemŋan munjema tɨk
         imin pokem =ŋan        munje          =ma       tɨk
         belly cold      =poss man             =poss     story
         ‘the calm man’s story’For the purposes of possession, animals and humans are considered higher ani-
mates, and plants are considered inanimate. Possessive relations expressed with
this construction include alienable, inalienable, body part, association and part-
whole possession. There is no morpho-syntactic distinction between these cate-
gories (but see Section 7.5 for the role of benefactive object suffixes in body part
possession).
     Some examples:animate singular body part (human):(4-45)   Mbanaŋma tokɨmot
         Mbanaŋ =ma              tokɨmot
         Mbanaŋ =poss            chest

         nuwomb =ŋa            taw
         stream      =poss side
         ‘the side of the stream’Recursive possession also occurs, using the possessive clitic on each possessor,
with the possessee unmarked (see also example 4-44):(4-51)   Samekma rorma mbor suman
         Samek =ma         ror     =ma mbor      suman
         Samek =poss child =poss pig             big
         ‘Samek’s child’s big pig’The animate possessive clitic can be used on an inanimate noun to highlight that
the noun has some kind of relation to humans:

tion system, but this is all that remains of it now.4.5.1 =ŋa(n) poss with adjectivesThe possessive clitic =ŋa(n) can also occur in construction with adjectives (see
Section 3.3 for more on adjectives). However in these cases the function is clearly
not possession but rather modification. For example:(4-54)   iminkato sawirŋa
         iminkato         sawir       =ŋa

         ‘big thief’
4.5.2 Possessive modificationThe possessive clitic can also occur, similarly to the above examples, but on
nouns or verbs as well as adjectives, to create modifiers: for example, in (4-57)–
(4-58) it occurs on a noun, rendering it a modifier, and in (4-59)–(4-61) it occurs on
an adjective which here modifies a verb:(4-57)   kandawŋa munje
         kandaw     =ŋa         munje

         around since when the ground emerged’)(4-59)   ei sumanŋa ror

         man      bad sore          =poss      smell   =poss
         ‘bad, sore-ridden, smelly man’In (4-59) the verb ei ‘cry’ is modified by ‘big’, the phrase in its turn modifying the
noun ‘child’. Example (4-60) has the same structure: the verb is followed by the
possessive-marked adjective, together modifying ‘woman’. Example (4-61) is more
complex. Here we have a head noun munje ‘man’, modified by adjective ‘bad’ and
134        4 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionpossessive-marked verbs ‘sore’ and ‘smelly’. Note that these are the only construc-
tions in which verbs can appear without person/status suffixes (see also Section 5.1).","[140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154]"
"3.4.4 Adverbials of frequency and distribution and ‘not yet’Two adverbials in Tayap express frequency and distribution (-re), and the tem-
poral relationship ‘not yet’ (ŋgo wákare). Note the formal parallel with the loca-
tive =re (see Section 3.4.3 above and Section 4.4); presumably these forms, while
having different functions, have the same origin. The suffix -re occurs on nouns,
and always involves reduplication, as the following examples show.-re ‘every’(3-64) a. Yu nimenda nirakkut arore arore. Rorsem aikindaka ambukenɨ

            ‘he hasn’t spoken yet’3.4.5 Elevational and positional adverbialsThe relative geographical position of objects and people is expressed in Tayap
much more frequently than it is in a language like English. When leaving
someone’s company, for example, one doesn’t just say ‘I’m going’, but rather,
‘I’m going up (in the direction of the rainforest)’ or ‘I’m going down (in the
direction of the mangrove lagoon)’. Similarly, if you have just arrived back
in Gapun from a trip to the village of Wongan, and someone asks you where
you have been, the correct answer is not ‘I was in Wongan’, but ‘I was down
in Wongan’.
     Elevational and positional relationships are lexically encoded in Tayap’s rich
set of verbs of motion, virtually all of which are being lost because of their irreg-
ular inflectional patterns (see Section 6.2.3). But Tayap also has a set of two free-
standing elevationals and seven positionals that are used to pinpoint the location
of an object or a person.
     Four of these are oriented according to a spatial array consisting of two axes.
                                                                   Adverbs      81

MANGROVE LAGOON                        down sire
     The vertical axis refers to the spatial elevationals of ‘up’ and ‘down’, for
instance being up in a tree or down on the ground.
     The horizontal axis refers to the geographical relationship between the rain-
forest and the mangrove lagoon. The mangrove lagoon that villagers have to cross
to get to the neighboring village of Wongan runs to the sea and lies to the north
of Gapun. The rainforest, in which the villagers live and into which they walk
every day to find sago palms to process and game to hunt, lies all around the
village, but most of the vast areas of their traditional land lies roughly south of
Gapun. In relation to the mighty Sepik River, which can be seen from the top of
the mountain where Gapun village was situated until after World War II, the man-
grove lagoon is ‘downstream’, and the rainforest is ‘upstream’. This is the sense
in which villagers say they went ‘down’ to Wongan and then came back ‘up’ to
Gapun. These directionals are relative to one another, so that when one has gone
‘up’ into the rainforest, one comes ‘down’ to Gapun village when one returns.
Note that the terms also cover all space within the village.
     The five other freestanding positionals are:    ari   ‘below’, in the sense of ‘down below’ on a slope
    ase   ‘beside’, ‘on the edge of’, ‘on the periphery of’
    aro   ‘inside’, in the sense of ‘enveloped in or covered by’
    ato   ‘outside’, ‘on the exterior of’
    osi   ‘on the other side’So, for example, in response to the question ‘Where is it?’, one might respond in
any of the following ways:

They can also be used as verbs in serial verb constructions, indicating motion, for
example (see Section 8.2):(3-69) yimbar ŋaŋan mbɨukuasetak
       yimbar ŋaŋan mbɨu -ku                   -ase -tak

       ‘She pulled my canoe outside’ (i.e. she pulled it from inside the rainforest
       out into the open)In addition to the freestanding elevationals and positionals, Tayap also has a
number of complex positionals, all but one of which (mborki) are nouns attached
with the locative clitic =nɨ.    imin=nɨ          ‘inside’ or ‘underneath’ (lit. ‘belly’ + loc)
    kandaŋ=nɨ        ‘under’, ‘at the base of’ (lit. ‘base’ + loc)
    mbokak=nɨ        ‘on top of’ (lit. ‘surface’ + loc)
    mborki=nɨ        ‘outside’, ‘visible, out in the open’
    mbwar=nɨ         ‘behind’ or ‘on’ (lit. ‘back’ + loc)
    nunuk=nɨ         ‘behind’ (lit. ‘back side’ + loc)
    orom=nɨ          ‘in the middle’ (lit. ‘middle’ + loc)
    raw=nɨ           ‘facing’ or ‘in front of’ (lit. ‘nose’ + loc)
    sek=nɨ           ‘underneath’ (lit. ‘underside’ + loc)
    taw=nɨ           ‘beside’ (lit. ‘side’ + loc)
The above positionals are nouns that can occur on their own – so one can say:(3-70)   raw =nɨ         aŋgi wuk
         nose =loc dx.f be.3sg.f.r
         ‘it’s in front’But speakers also frequently combine locative positionals like rawnɨ with the free-
standing elevationals and positionals, as well as more complex elements like the
possessive-marked noun in (3-71a–c), to specify location. One of the tests I did for
positionals was to put a plastic box in the middle of my floor and then put a torch
(i.e. a flashlight) in various positions in, under, behind, etc. the box. Some of the
positionals I elicited in this way are as follows (Note: tos ‘torch’ and kontena ‘box’
or ‘container’ are Tok Pisin words):
84        3 Word classes(3-71)   a. tos     kontena =ŋa         mbwar =nɨ  wo wuk

            ‘the torch is underneath the box’In addition to the elevationals and positionals discussed above, Tayap has two
further spatial adverbials that denote relative distance: kemrak ‘far away’ and
menjikan ‘nearby’. Examples are:(3-72)   a. ŋɨ ŋgɨnana kemrak puŋgot
            ŋɨ       ŋgɨ   = nana kemrak       puŋgot

            ‘the plate is there near your leg’3.5 PronounsTayap has a single set of pronouns that occur in three different cases: absolutive,
ergative and possessive.
     The possessive pronouns are formed by adding the possessive clitic = ŋa(n)
to the absolutive-case pronouns (with some irregularities), and the ergative pro-
nouns are formed by adding the nominal ergative clitics (see Section 4.3) to the
absolutive forms, again with some irregularities. Note that bound pronominal
forms are listed below and discussed in Section 5.3.","[99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104]"
"It is not always clear how to determine which object morpheme – the non-final
verb object morpheme or the other form – will be used in any given instance.
      So in tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana (repeated from (8-1)) notice that the non-final
object -at 3sg.m.nfo occurs after the first verb, and the form that occurs with
other verbs, -ŋgɨ 3sg.m.r.o occurs after the second non-final verb:(8-9) tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana

        ‘she will carry him down on her shoulders’The subject of a complex predicate like tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana is encoded on the
inflected final verb, and it is this final verb that would be negated to negate the
predicate. To see this clearly, below are examples of this same complex predicate
inflected for different subjects. Note the differences in the subject suffix (in bold)
just prior to the final intentional suffix – everything else in the verb remains the
same. Example (8-10d), repeated from (8-2), gives the negated verb, where, as

8.2.3 Verbs that always or usually occur only in svcs8.2.3.1 svcs with the grammaticalized verb kv ‘bring’, ‘take’
The verb stem kv only ever occurs as a non-final verb within a svc. It expresses
that an object will be brought to the deictic center or taken away from the deictic
center in a way that is specified by the verb of motion that follows it.
    Tayap has a number of verbs that express different ways of carrying objects.
They include:    andruwe ‘carry on head’
    erorar ‘carry on back’
    ser-(p)-e ‘carry in hand’
    tap ‘carry on shoulders’
    wuw ‘carry on one shoulder’Verbs like these express specific ways of carrying an object. The verb stem kv, on
the other hand, does not specify how an object is carried. It simply means ‘bring’
or ‘take’ in both the narrow sense of physically carrying something, and in the
more extended sense of, for instance, ‘bringing the visitors down (or taking them
down) to the end of the village to send them off’. Tayap speakers use the Tok Pisin
word “kisim” as a more or less exact equivalent.
     Unlike all other verbs in the language, kv never functions as a final verb of a
serial verb construction, nor indeed any other verb type:
– it never occurs without another verb following it in a serial verb construction;
– it is not marked for tense;
– it does not take subject morphemes (although it does take object marking);
– and it cannot be independently negated.","[254, 255]"
"3.1.3.2 Principles of gender assignment
There are two genders in Tayap: feminine and masculine. Humans have natural
gender, even though this can be overridden when the referent is non-particular
(see below). The gender classification of all other animate nouns is decided by
three criteria.
58          3 Word classes    The first is particularity: the unmarked, generic form of all nouns, including
animate nouns, is feminine.1
    The second is sex: a male referent may be specified as masculine and a female
referent feminine.
    The third criterion is size and shape: long, thin and large referents tend to be
masculine; short, stocky and small referents tend to be feminine.
    Snakes (long and thin) and cassowaries (tall and imposing), therefore, are
prototypically masculine; pigs (fat and stocky) are prototypically feminine. So in
a sentence like ‘he speared a pig’, the object ‘pig’ will be designated by the femi-
nine object suffix -ku unless the speaker specifically wants to point out that it was
male, in which case the masculine object suffix -ŋgɨ would be used.
    The difference is as follows:(3-19) a. ŋɨŋi mbor pokun
          ŋɨ      =ŋi       mbor po         -ku                       -n
          3sg.m =erg.m pig         strike.r -3sg.f.r.o                -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘he speared a (female) pig’        b. ŋɨŋi mbor poŋgɨn
           ŋɨ      =ŋi      mbor po           -ŋgɨ       -n
           3sg.m =erg.m pig          strike.r -3sg.m.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
           ‘he speared a (male) pig’The following chart shows the process of gender assignment in Tayap:
                                              Is it particular?
                                          yes               no                                   is it male?             feminine
                             yes                 no
                                                 feminine      shape long?                      shape stocky?
      yes       no                     yes            nomasculine       feminine           feminine           masculineTayap gender decision tree
1 Foley (2000: 371) notes that among those Papuan languages which have gender, binary con-
trasts are typical, and feminine is always the unmarked gender.
                                                                     Nouns           59
     As the chart suggests, even though snakes and cassowaries are commonly
masculine, a short, fat snake or a squat, short-necked cassowary could be referred
to using feminine forms.
     The shape-based assignment of gender is not entirely predictable, however.
A praying mantis is generally masculine, perhaps because its name is homopho-
nous with ‘cassowary’ (i.e. ŋgat). And a millipede (kakámatik), even though it is
long, is generally feminine, perhaps because it is stubby, fat, and slow moving,
at least compared to a centipede (yandum), which is sleek and slithering (and
generally masculine).
     Even though nouns tend to be generally classified as feminine, there are
some nouns which are always (in the case of natural phenomena and insects) or
tend to be (in the case of animals and birds) masculine.
     The nouns in question are:Natural phenomena       Animals, birds and insectsarawer ‘sun’            aram ‘snake’                    ŋgararik ‘monitor lizard’
ŋgudum ‘star’           kakarpwap ‘eagle’               ŋgat ‘cassowary’; ‘praying
nekan ‘earthquake’      kamban ‘magpie’                 mantis’
aruat ‘thunder’         kekékato ‘worm’                 njakep ‘flying fox bat’
pora ‘wind’             momɨk ‘guria pigeon’            ondom ‘hornbill’
urerŋgar ‘lightning’    nekan ‘stick insect’, Note:     orem ‘crocodile’
                        homophonous with ‘earthquake’   pesaw ‘bird of paradise’
                                                        yandum ‘centipede’
Examples are:(3-20) nekan        katot
       earthquake happen.3sg.m.r
       ‘an earthquake (m) happened’(3-21) ŋayi aram tanɨŋgɨn
       ŋa =yi          aram ta -nɨ -ŋgɨ      -n
       1sg =erg.f snake see.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r. s
       ‘I (f) saw a snake (m)’This gender system shares some similarity with the East Sepik, Ndu family lan-
guage Manambu, in which gender assignment is determined in part by the size
and shape of the referent (Aikhenvald et al. 2008; see also Reesink 2003 on North
Papuan languages). Aikhenvald et al. (2008: 112) note that shape-based gender
assignment is a feature of languages of the Sepik area, also citing Alamblak (Bruce
60        3 Word classes1984). Other languages of the Sepik-Ramu region have gender, but very different
systems: Foley (2000: 366) notes for instance that Lower Sepik languages have a
phonological gender system; that is, gender assignment is based on the phono-
logical form of the noun root.
    On the other hand, the situational element to Tayap’s gender system – in
which gender is partly a matter of the discourse situation rather than a fixed
property of a noun – is reminiscent of that of Bilua, a Papuan language spoken
on Vella Lavella in the Solomon Islands. In Bilua, masculine gender is used
for third-person singular masculine human referents as well as “singulative”
non-human nouns. But all other nouns are marked feminine, the default form
(Obata 2003: 88, 105–109).","[77, 78, 79, 80]"
"So the negated form of this verb is:(8-2) tapr                   -at        kɨ    -ŋgɨ
      carry_on_shoulders.irr -3sg.m.nfo bring -3sg.m.r.o       atɨ              -kɨ    wákare
       go_down.irr -irr neg
       ‘(she) won’t (or didn’t) carry him down on her shoulders’Further, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana is a single phonological word (see Section 2.7).
Note, however, that the boundary between the non-final object (nfo, which in
this case is -at; see below 8.2.2) and the main final verb that takes subject marking
1 The vowel harmonizes to the vowel of the object.

is permeable, and can be interrupted by question morphemes and even separate
words, as in the following:(8-3) kopi tarak masinnɨ ŋgakrawokwankuk
      kopi        tar       -ak       masin=nɨ
      coffee (TP) take.irr -3sg.f.nfo machine (TP)=loc      ŋgakrawo -kwan               kuk
      shell.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o be.sg.f|1pl.r
      ‘we used to take the coffee to a machine and shell it’In this situation the form is no longer a single phonological word but still a single
predicate.
     Serial verb constructions are composed of one or more non-final verb(s) and
a final verb. The non-final verbs are always formally irrealis, but the final verb can
take the full range of Tayap’s TAM inflections. TAM and subject marking occurs
once across the construction, on the final verb, and the non-final verb(s) are
marked only for their object, if transitive.
     According to Haspelmath (2016: 296), a serial verb construction is “a mono-
clausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element
linking them and with no predicate-argument relation between the verbs”. It is
important to make clear that non-final and final verbs are both independent, and
there is not a relationship of syntactic dependency between the verbs of a serial
verb construction. Instead, there is a sharing of features (TAM, subject marking
and negation). The differences between non-final and final verbs are positional, a
factor of where they fall in the clause, rather than related to dependency.","[250, 251]"
"
6.1.3 Class 1 and 2 verbs in young people’s TayapAll verbs that have different stems in their irrealis and realis forms pose problems
for young speakers of Tayap. What generally happens whenever young speakers
are unsure of a form is that they take the irrealis stem (which is the same as the
verb root) and inflect that stem with realis morphology – that is, with object and
subject morphemes marked for realis status.
174          6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbs      So a class 2 verb like war ‘fill’ will be inflected as(6-15) a. *war        -ku                -n
          fill.irr -3sg.f.r.o            -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘I filled it’instead of the correct form, which is:        b.   par -ku                 -n
             fill.r -3sg.f.r.o       -sg|1pl.r.s
             ‘I filled it’An incorrect form like *warkun indicates that the speaker is using the verb root,
war, as the basis for inflection. All young people do this, and this kind of error
demonstrates a central feature of how young speakers produce Tayap verb mor-
phology: they clearly perceive the morphological structure of verbs but they are
unable to produce them correctly.
     The speaker who produced *warkun possibly had a sense that the verb she
wanted is associated with both the semivowel w and the plosive p. Having heard
parkun (‘I filled it’), warkrutak (‘she will fill it’, or ‘you (f) will fill it’) and warkru
wákare (‘X won’t fill it) all her life, the speaker who produced this utterance
probably intuitively knew the different forms that this verb can take. She has not
analyzed the different sounds as signifying different tenses and statuses, and so
what she ends up producing is a verb that mixes together realis and irrealis forms
and results in an ungrammatical neologism.
     Young speakers who attempt to inflect class 1 or 2 verbs that they do not auto-
matically know do one of three things:
     The first thing they can do is illustrated by the above example: they include
both the irrealis and realis forms in the same verb. Other examples are *wurpukun
(instead of puwkun; from wuw ‘carry on shoulder’) and *woipokun (instead of
poikun; from woi ‘roll’).
     The second strategy is to conjugate the class 1 or 2 verb as though it were a
class 5 verb. This means treating the verb root as though it is invariant, and also
using a discontinuous subject marker in the non-future. So a class 1 verb like
kotar-(p)-e ‘ask’ becomes *kotar and is inflected as:(6-16) a. *kotar -tu -ku         -n
          ask.irr -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
          ‘she asked her’
                                                        Transitive verb classes     175
instead of the correct form:        b. kotarpe -ku               -n
           ask.r    -3sg.f.r.o       -sg|1pl.r.s
           ‘she asked her’The ungrammatical verb *kotar-tu-ku-n is a perfectly correctly formed class 5 verb
(see below, Section 6.1.7). The problem is that the verb in question, kotar-(p)-e-, is
a class 1 verb, not a class 5 verb.
     At the same time, however, it is important to note that anyone hearing the
ungrammatical verb *kotar-tu-ku-n will have no trouble understanding its
meaning. The verb root kotar means ‘query’. It derives the noun ‘question’ (as
kotarŋgar) and the intransitive verb ‘ask’, kotarkɨ. Because this basic meaning of
the verb root is known to everyone, it does not make a great deal of difference for
comprehension if the verb is conjugated as a class 1 verb or as a class 5 verb.
     This kind of separable relationship between the meaning of a verb root and the
details of its inflection will likely lead to the attrition of class 1 and 2 verbs. When
it doesn’t matter is if a verb is inflected as mbuspiŋgɨn (class 1, mbus-(p)-i ‘send’)
or mbustiŋgɨn (‘send’ inflected as a class 5 verb), the less regular inflection will
inexorably decline in use in the speech of young speakers who have not learned it.
     At the same time as young speakers simplify Tayap verbal morphology in this
way – that is, treating verbs of other classes as though they were all class 5 verbs –
there is also a competing tendency to insert a p in verbs that do not take one. So
some young speakers produce forms like the following:(6-17) a. *moserpi -ku                 -n
          buy.r       -3sg.f.r.o       -sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘I bought it’instead of        b. mose -nu -ku              -n
           buy.r -s      <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg.m|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
           ‘I bought it’
           verb root moser (class 4)(6-18) a. *andpi     -ku       -n
          follow.r <3sg.f.r.o> - sg|1pl.r.s
          ‘I followed her’instead of
176        6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbs        b. kandu       -ku           -n
           follow.r <3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|2sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
           ‘I followed her’
           verb root andu- (class 3)Both (6-17a and 6-18a) are inflected as class 1 verbs in the non-future tense,
despite the fact that moser ‘buy’ is a class 4 verb and andu ‘follow’ is a class 3
verb. These cases exhibit the opposite of the tendency just discussed: instead of
collapsing class 1 and 2 verbs into class 5 verbs, verbs from other classes become
incorporated into class 1 and 2 verbs.
     There may have always been some free variation in Tayap on this count. In
the speech of the oldest Tayap speakers, for example, I recorded two words for
the verb ‘sweep’; one mburai (class 5) and the other mburai-(p)-i (class 1). The
difference in non-future inflection between these two verbs is the element that
directly follows the stem: in the first verb that is n or t plus a vowel, in the second
verb it is a p.
     So using the first verb, one would say that a woman mburaitukun her house;
using the second, one would say she mburaipikun.
     When I asked if these two forms meant anything different the oldest speakers in
the village told me no, they were exact synonyms. And that they were both correct.
     The co-existence of two different forms of the same verb suggests that there may
have always been some accepted variation in the classification of verbs as class 5 or
class 1 verbs. If this is the case, then it seems that some young speakers have honed
in on that variation and exploited it. They inflect verbs as class 1 verbs (i.e. inserting
a p in the non-future) much less frequently than they simply collapse all verbs into
class 5 verbs. But the fact that they can create class 1 verbs out of verb roots from
other classes shows, once again, that young speakers possess a broad repertoire of
grammatical competence in Tayap. What they lack is productive ability.
     The third strategy that young speakers use when they are unsure of how to
conjugate a class 1 or 2 verb in the non-future is to inflect it in the progressive
aspect. This often makes little semantic sense. But as is discussed in Section
8.3.1, the progressive aspect is an “easy” inflectional form – all one needs to know
is three things: (1) the irrealis stem form of the verb; (2) the benefactive object
(which in most cases will be -kwan ‘3sg.f.ben.r.o’); and (3) the correct form of the
verb ‘be’. This relative morphological transparency appeals to younger speakers
and allows them to use verbs they otherwise would have a hard time inflecting.
     Thus, rather than tackling the class 2 verb war ‘grate’, to generate the correct
non-future form parkun ‘I grated it’, or the class 1 verb o ‘shoot’, to generate the
correct non-future form pokun ‘I shot it’, young speakers telling stories about
their actions and adventures say things like the following:
                                                      Transitive verb classes     177
(6-19) a. war          -kwan       -kuk
          grate.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o -be.1sg.f.r.s
          ‘I (f) was grating it’        b. o           -kwan         -kut
           strike.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o - be.sg.m.r.s
           ‘I (m) was shooting it’These are perfectly formed progressives. However, the context in which they
occurred demanded the non-future tense. But by inflecting the verbs in the pro-
gressive aspect, the speakers who needed them were at least able to use them.
This phenomenon illustrates a general rule of grammatical decay in Tayap,
namely: the weaker the speaker, the more instances of the progressive aspect that
speaker will use (see also Section 8.3.1).","[193, 194, 195, 196, 197]"
"5.5 ReduplicationThe reduplication of verbs is another way of expressing temporality and epis-
temic stance (usually disapproval). The repetition or iteration of an action, for
example, is expressed by repeating the verb stem:(5-21) a.    ketukketukkwankut
             ketuk       ketuk       -kwan    -kut
             cough.irr cough.irr -3sg.f.ben.o -be.sg.m.r

           ‘You can’t keep telling lies to me! You’re like a fucking foreigner with

160       5 Basic verb morphology5.5.1 Repeated action
There are a number of ways of showing an action is repeated. The following
example shows repetition, rather than reduplication strictly speaking, of a verb:       b. ŋgɨ amkwar ŋgwoka ŋgwoka ŋayi ŋgɨ orepemɨn
          ŋgɨ am     -kwar ŋgwok      -a      ŋgwok           -a
          3pl fight -mann go.3pl.r -and go.3pl.r              -and           ŋa =yi         ŋgɨ orepe       -mɨ       -n
           1sg =erg.f 3pl leave.r -3pl.r.o -sg|1pl.r.s
           ‘they were fighting for a long time and I (gender
           unspecified) left them ’In addition to simply repeating a verb to convey that an action or event occurred
several times or extended over a period of time, Tayap has a verbal suffix (-ítŋo)
that marks an action or event as occurring repeatedly and exaggeratedly over
a continuous, extended period of time. The meaning of this form corresponds
to the durative “igo” construction in Tok Pisin – e.g. “em i krai igo igo igo”; ‘he
cried and cried and cried’. The suffix only occurs on intransitive verbs and this
restricted usage may have limited the form’s transmission.
     Speakers under forty understand the meaning of verbs that have the -ítŋo
suffix, but they never produce the forms themselves. In 2009, even speakers over
fifty had trouble thinking of examples. Perhaps the forms occurred mainly in
ritual narrative and singing or tuneful weeping over corpses – verbal skills that
for the most part have become moribund in Gapun.
     In the 1980s, I recorded the suffix -ítŋo for verbs that were repeated over an
extended period of time, for example in the following verbs:           emrar-ítŋo       poror-ítŋo
           play.irr-xd      sing.irr-xd           ketuk-ítŋo       simber-ítŋo
           cough.irr-xd     chew_betel_nut.irr-xd           warak-ítŋo
           talk.irr-xd
I was also told that an alternative form that meant the same thing was the irrealis
verb stem + -ít- + ŋayar, which is an adverb meaning ‘really’. Senior men told me
that both forms below express the same meaning – perhaps because the first form
may be a contraction of the second:
                                                             Reduplication       161
           emrar-ítŋo or emrar-it             ŋayar
           play.irr-xd   play.irr-xd?         reallyThe -ítŋo suffix that I recorded in the 1980s no longer occurs in the speech of
anyone in Gapun.
     Today, to the very limited extent that the idea of repeated actions over an
extended period is encoded by a verbal suffix at all, this is done by adding the
suffix -ŋo, or its variants -eŋo, -erŋo and -irŋo directly to the irrealis stem of an
intransitive verb. The suffix is the same for all subjects; a verb with this suffix
takes no subject endings, and the verb is always repeated.(5-23) a. pororŋo pororŋo ŋgakre mbɨdtak

           ‘She (or ‘they’ or ‘we’) fucked and fucked so much that her vagina
           hurt’
162         5 Basic verb morphology5.6 Reflexive and reciprocal constructionsReflexive and reciprocal constructions are formed by adding the suffix -ano
(-ŋano after a vowel) to the subject pronoun.
     In reflexive constructions, the valency of a verb is decreased, so a verb that
normally takes two arguments – a subject and object – instead only takes one.
There is no explicit grammatical marking of this decreasing valency other than in
the fact that a verb in a reflexive construction is always intransitive.(5-24) a. awin nanuknɨ ŋaŋano taniet
          awin nanuk =nɨ       ŋa -ŋano ta   -niet
          mirror        =loc 1sg -refl see.r -1sg.m|3sg.m.r
          ‘I saw myself in the mirror’Non singular subjects in this construction convey reciprocity:       b. yimano yim tatike
          yim -ano yim ta           -tike
          1pl -refl 1pl see.r -dl.r
          ‘the two of us saw ourselves’ or ‘saw each other’       c. ŋgɨŋano amurukuke
          ŋgɨ -ŋano amuru -kuke
          3pl -refl fight.r -dl.r
          ‘the two of them are fighting each other’This construction can also be used for emphasis, to convey that the subject does
the action alone:(5-25) a.    yuŋano nitukun!
             yu     -ŋano ni   -tu -ku       -n!
             you -refl do.sbj -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
             ‘Do it yourself!’       b. ŋgɨŋanokɨ kirawtukuro

          3pl -refl -emph know.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -3pl.r.s
          ‘they realize it themselves’
6 The formation of realis and irrealis verbsPerhaps the single most complex feature of Tayap’s grammar is the formation
of verbs in the realis status. The realis stem forms are only used in forming the
non-future tense and the perfect aspect. However, because the realis status is
what speakers use to refer to actions and events that have occurred in the past
or are occurring in the present – as well as to make gnomic statements like ‘birds
fly’ – it is the single most frequently occurring inflectional form in the speech of
fluent Tayap speakers.
     In the speech of younger, less fluent speakers, the non-future tense is still
used, but the weakest speakers do their best to get around it as much as they can.
To manage this, they overextend the progressive aspect, which is easier to inflect,
partly because the verb stem inflects in its irrealis form and thus remains consist-
ent, and partly because the suffixes that encode person and number that follow
the verb stem have minimal variation (see Section 5.3).
     The realis status is another kettle of fish. Its inflectional forms are irregular
both in terms of the kinds of changes that occur in verb stems, and also in terms
of their relative predictability. Transitive and intransitive verbs have very different
inflectional patterns.
     The following section (Section 6.1) discusses transitive verbs; intransitive
verbs are discussed separately in Section 6.2.","[178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183]"

CommentaryThe narrator of this story is an example of a young passive active speaker, a villager
who never speaks more than a few formulaic phases of Tayap. She speaks Tok Pisin
to everyone: her children, her husband, her old mother, her siblings, and even her
mother-in-law, with whom she interacts every day, and who is a Tayap-dominant
woman in her late fifties. Despite the fact that this young woman never speaks
Tayap, she not only possesses solid grammatical competence in the language; she
is also able to activate that competence to produce narratives of relatively great
complexity. She is the youngest villager able to do this; her husband, who is 6 years
older, was able to produce a coherent narrative only with her active intervention.
     Gapuners would judge this narrative to be a good story in terms of structure,
content and performance. It adheres to the village narrative convention of having
the protagonist or protagonists go off into the rainforest, have something happen
                                       Tayap Text 4: Young men kill a cassowary     317
there, and then return, at the end of the story, back to the village. It contains
detail and a variety of perspectives. It is dramatic.
       Grammatically, the narrative is complex. It contains a number of different
verbs of motion besides ‘go’ and ‘come’ (lines 4–5, 16, 21, 22, 36), serial verbs (lines
13, 15, 23, 36) and clauses coordinated with the clause subordinating morpheme
-re (lines 26, 51). All verbs but one are correctly inflected for subject – this speaker
makes none of the errors that most other young speakers make, discussed
throughout the grammar. The one inflectional error she does make is tuptukro
‘they went first’ in line 7; but she corrects herself and produces the correct form a
few words later. Her pronunciation of the word, /tuptuko/, deviates a bit from the
more usual tɨptuko, but it is within the range of acceptable variation.
     The only grammatical mistakes made by the speaker both occur with regard to
the gender of the snake. For most of the narrative, the snake is correctly gendered
masculine. But three times, in lines 29, 33, and 42, it becomes feminine (even if line
29 is ambiguous, because it isn’t entirely clear what the speaker is referring to).","[336, 337]"
"
Even though these two sentences can be translated the same way in English, they
are not synonymous in Tayap. The first example is the unmarked construction:
it is a simple declarative sentence consisting of a transitive class 1 verb stem (po)
suffixed by a 3sg.f object morpheme denoting the pig (-ku) and a subject ending
(-n) denoting ‘he’, all inflected for realis.
      The second example is marked. It contains the same verb stem inflected for
realis, but instead of the object morpheme that refers to the pig that was shot,
what follows is a morpheme that means ‘mine’, ‘the one belonging to me’ or ‘the
one whose being shot had consequences for me’. Morphemes that encode this
relation often also encode the notion of benefit, and in keeping with other lin-
guistic work on Papuan languages (e.g. Foley 1991: 307–11), here they are labeled
“benefactive”, even if the label is not entirely satisfying, because the actions
encoded by the verb do not necessarily entail benefit. In (7-29a)–(7-29b) above, for
example, the spearing of my pig may be malefactive, and it may have happened
contrary to the speaker’s knowledge, will or desire.
      The ben morphemes highlight a relationship of possession and/or the con-
sequences that an action or event have on the person or thing denoted by the
morphemes. In (7-29a) and (7-29b) above, a relation of possession is expressed
                                                        Benefactive (ben)     219
in both examples, by means of the possessive pronoun ŋaŋan ‘my’. But while
possession is evident in the first example, it is emphasized in the second, partly
through the possessive pronoun (which can be omitted in this construction) and
partly through the benefactive morphology affixed to the verb stem.
    Benefactive morphemes often occur on a transitive verb like ‘give’. Here the
possessive meaning of ‘what belongs to me’ or ‘what should belong to me’ is
evident.(7-30) isia(ta)n

       give.sbj -1sg.ben.r.o sg|1pl.r.s
       ‘give it to me’Benefactive object morphemes also appear when one talks about possessed items
such as body parts:(7-31)   a. kokɨr mbɨdtia(ta)n

            ‘the man’s spine hurts’
220         7 Mood         Note: adu ‘break’ is a class 3 transitive verb; hence the verb stem variation in these
         examples (7-31c and d; see Section 6.1.4)
Although as already noted, the benefactive morphemes do not necessarily carry
a positive meaning of benefit (something that is apparent from examples (7-31c –
7-31d) about bone-breaking), they often do express the meaning of doing some-
thing for the benefit of someone, even though it is often difficult in practice to
separate the sense of beneficiary from that of possession.
     A command like the following means both ‘Get rid of the rubbish that is in her
house’ and ‘Get rid of the house’s rubbish for her benefit’:(7-32)   patɨrŋa pipia aŋgo wostukwa(ta)n
         patɨr =ŋa       pipia         aŋgo

         ‘get rid of this rubbish in her house‘; ‘get rid of this house’s rubbish for her’The following command is similar: it means both ‘Light my cigarette’ and ‘Light
my cigarette for me’.(7-33)   ŋaŋan sokoi wototia(ta)n
         ŋaŋan       sokoi       woto       -t -ia(ta)     -n
         1sg.poss cigarette light.irr -s <1sg.ben.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
         ‘light my cigarette’; ‘light my cigarette for me’Because they foreground a relationship of possession or one in which an agent
has been affected by an action or event, benefactive object morphemes can be
affixed to any verb stem – even an intransitive, stative verb like ‘be’.
     One old woman once told a story of how she upbraided her teenage son for
taking money out of her net bag without her permission. “Yesterday you cried for
me to give you money”, she recounted herself saying, “and I gave you two kina to
buy biscuits, which you bought and ate”1.
     After having established her prior generosity, the woman continued, saying
in a self-pitying voice:
1 The kina, from the Tok Pisin word for ‘clam’, is Papua New Guinea’s main unit of currency.
                                                                  Benefactive (ben)          221

       ‘my 3 kina is there’; i.e. it’s all I have leftHere the benefactive morphemes foreground the speaker as both possessing and
being directly affected by the presence of the three kina. Not only are her three
kina there; they are three kina that are there specifically for her benefit and use.
    Earlier, this same speaker, also talking about herself, said:(7-35)     saki tutor ŋayar kuka nda ikur sisiatan
           saki       tutor   ŋayar kuk               -a   nda ikur

           ‘I (f) sat there doing nothing at all and the evening fell on me’Verbs constructed with the benefactive morphemes are formed according to the

222        7 MoodBecause benefactive morphemes are object/undergoer-like morphemes, they
occur in the expected object slot in a verb’s architecture, thus precluding the
appearance of the object marker. Note that a coreferential NP can appear with
the object marker: see for example (7-37a) below. And like the other object mor-
phemes that have been discussed and exemplified throughout this grammar, the
benefactive object morphemes are marked as either realis or irrealis.
    The forms of the benefactive object marker can be compared to those of the
(non-benefactive) object morphemes:         non-benefactive object     benefactive object

express expectation, supposition and surprise. Two of these particles – awa and
mera – occur with both verbs and other parts of speech. Kapa modifies only
nouns and adjectives and nímera occurs with only verbs.","[238, 239, 240, 241, 242, 243]"
"5.3 Object (o) and subject (s/a) suffixes5.3.1 Object suffixesBefore going on to discuss the range of TAM distinctions made in Tayap, it will
be useful to distinguish the various forms of the object and subject suffixes that,
together with the verb stems, encode TAM on a verb.
     Taking the object suffixes first, note how their forms in irrealis are simply
the realis forms with an r inserted before the vowel in all cases except 1sg, which
retains the same form in both statuses. Interestingly, only the 3pl is distinguished
from the other non-singular suffixes in both paradigms:

5.3.2 Subject (S/A) suffixesTayap’s subject (S/A) suffixes can be compared in Tables 5.2 and 5.3 below. Irrealis
subject suffixes only mark gender for singular subjects, and realis subject suffixes
do not mark gender at all. Both paradigms collapse second person non-singular,
they distinguish third person plural, and they collapse first and third person
dual. Note that these complex syncretisms are different in different paradigms
(see Section 3.5 for other pronoun paradigms, including the free pronouns and
benefactive suffixes).","[164, 165]"
"7.1 Subjunctive (sbj)Tayap has a distinct set of verb forms that encode a speaker’s desire that another
person do something. The underlying syntactic structure in which a subjunctive
appears is a subordinate clause (i.e. ‘I want that X do Y’), but a separate set of
subjunctive forms can also occur in a main clause. Since those forms only occur
in indirect commands, they are discussed below in Section 7.1.5.
     The inflectional pattern for intransitive and transitive verbs in the subjunc-
tive mood is as follows:
https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-007
                                                                    Subjunctive (sbj)         201

                              and object endings
intransitive verbs            subjunctive verb stem + realis subject ending
Below are the subjunctive inflections for the intransitive verb aiki ‘come’ and the
class 3 transitive verb a ‘eat’. To clearly see the difference between the subjunc-
tive and the indicative, the indicative inflections of those verbs appear in the two
right-hand columns:(7-1)                                                                       indicative

A verb like aiki ‘come’ notwithstanding, the subjunctive stem form of most verbs
has the same realization as the verb’s irrealis stem form. The exceptions to this
pattern are discussed in Sections 7.1.2.1 and 7.1.2.2 below.
    The subjunctive in Tayap is used to express the following speech acts:
(a) direct imperatives (‘Take this food to Kapiru!’)
(b) jussive imperatives (‘Let her go’);
(c) indirect commands (‘Tell them to hit him’; ‘Make them go away’);
(d) wishes (‘I want you all to go to Sanae’)
Each of these four uses of the subjunctive involves different grammatical and syn-
tactic components. A direct imperative can, by itself, constitute a sentence. Jussive
imperatives involve the fixed expression ŋganokaw, which does not change for
person or number. Indirect commands can be expressed in two ways, one using
the subjunctive in both the main clause and the subordinate clause; and one just
juxtaposing two independent clauses in the declarative mood. The expression of
a wish, similarly, has several forms, only one of which involves the subjunctive.
202        7 Mood7.1.2 ImperativeThe imperative mood expresses a command that is directly addressed to one
person (‘you come!’) or to several people (‘you all come!’). In Tayap there are two
kinds of imperatives: positive imperatives – commands to do something – and
negative imperatives, commands to not do something.
     Negative imperatives have a particular morphology and are discussed under
prohibitives and admonitives (see Sections 7.2 and 7.3).
     Positive imperatives – a command that an addressee perform some action –
are realized differently for intransitive and transitive verbs.","[220, 221, 222]"
"Bird namesA separate list of words for birds appears at the end of this dictionary. For the sake
of completeness, however, the words for birds are also listed in the appropriate

348        Tayap-English-Tok Pisin DictionaryVulgarity (tok nogut)I have purposely included numerous examples of what the villagers usually refer
to by the Tok Pisin words “tok nogut”, which means ‘bad talk’, or ‘vulgarity’ (the
Tayap equivalent is wekok).
     One reason I do this is for the pure entertainment value of such talk – as I
mention at the beginning of the grammar, Gapun villagers are no different from
anyone else who has ever scoured a dictionary to check to see which scandalous
words have been enshrined in print.
     But in addition to this more purient consideration, there is also the issue
of linguistic preservation. ‘Bad talk’ is disappearing in the Tayap language, not
because people don’t swear anymore (they swear all the time: one of a child’s first
phrases these days is “kaikai kan”, ‘eat cunt’, to express opposition or dissatis-
faction), but because the majority of the swearing, even by people who otherwise
speak excellent Tayap, now is in Tok Pisin.
     The gist of this swearing is the same – in Tayap, most swearing involves
some variation of ‘cunt’, ‘asshole’ or ‘prick’, and so it does also in Tok Pisin. The
difference is that swearing in Tayap can be poetic, consisting of complex verbal
constructions, like ‘His mother gave birth to him through her asshole together
with a pile of shit, while lightning flashed!’ (Ŋan mayayi yɨwɨrŋan ŋgwabek-
enɨ pomborrekɨ tatɨŋgɨŋan mamrairekɨ!’), or ‘Your big cunthole is fucking
sagging!’ (Ŋgwab mɨr rumbrutak otɨtekŋa apro sakar! – the image the verb
phrase rumbrutak otɨtekŋa conjures for the villagers is loose mud on a river-
bank sagging down towards the water).
     Swearing in Tok Pisin consists of relatively unimaginative noun phrases
(“kan pekpek” ‘cunt shit’ and “wul pekpek” ‘shit hole’ are favorites). These words
have the same affective force as the Tayap curses, but from a linguistic perspec-
tive, they are boring.
     My inclusion of so much swearing is to remind the villagers that Tayap has
an impressive, lyrical arsenal of vulgarity at its disposal. The loss of imaginative
swearing is as lamentable as the loss of any other domain of language use and
linguistic creativity.","[367, 368]"
"Another example of how the perfect is used to distinguish different kinds of com-
pletedness is an extract from a conversation in which a man in his fifties was com-
menting to others about how young people no longer speak Tayap. This man says
that if young Gapuners go to another village and the people there want to attack
them and beat them up, they won’t be able to communicate with one another to
organize their defense. “What language will you speak to one another?”, he asks
rhetorically:(5-16) eŋgin mernɨ namkɨtak, ŋgɨgi tatukrora
       eŋgin         mer       =nɨ nam       -kɨ -tak            ŋgɨ=gi
       white_people language =loc talk.irr -irr -2sg.f|3sg.f.irr 3pl=erg.pl       ta           -tu -ku            -ro       -ra
       perceive.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -3pl.r.s -perf
       ‘If one speaks Tok Pisin, they’ve already understood your plans’ (lit.
       ‘You will speak in Tok Pisin, they’ve already understood it’). (Note
       the use of the feminine subject ending -tak to denote a non-specific,
       general referent; see Section 3.1.3.3.)Notice here that the use of the perfect here carries the meaning of ‘already’ – the
foreign villagers will have understood the unfortunate Tok Pisin-speaking Tayap
villagers’ plans before they are even finished being articulated.
     There are significant differences in how the perfect is used in the speech of
fluent speakers and how it is used by speakers younger than thirty. For fluent
speakers of Tayap, the perfect combines elements of tense (time in the past) and
aspect (relevance to now) and is used to mark an action as having been completed.
                                            Tense, aspect and mood in Tayap     157
For young speakers, the scope of the perfect suffix has been expanded. In addi-
tion to functioning grammatically to express temporal relations, it also functions
syntactically to coordinate clauses.
    Tayap has several clause coordinating suffixes, including the suffix -api,
which means ‘afterward’ (see Section 9.3.2). This suffix is not used by speakers
younger than thirty. Instead, one of the ways those speakers coordinate clauses is
with the use of the perfect suffix.
    Here are the two ways a fluent speaker might say ‘After she talked to Akep,
Mbopai left’:(5-17) a.   Akepre waraktakapi, Mbopai wok
            Akep      =re     warak -tak            -api Mbopai wok
            Akep      =loc talk.r -2sg.f|3sg.f.r -aft Mbopai go.3sg.f.r
            ‘after she talked to Akep, Mbopai left’       b.   Akepre warakrapi, Mbopai wok
            Akep      =re     warak     -r- -api Mbopai wok
            Akep      =loc talk.irr -r- -aft Mbopai go.3sg.f.r
            ‘after she talked to Akep, Mbopai left’The perfect is not used in either of these two sentences. The sentences do not fore-
ground the completedness of the action of talking; they foreground the temporal
relationship between the actions expressed in the clauses. They mark the sub-
ordinate clause (‘after she talked’) as the background or condition for the main
clause (‘she left’).
    Here is how a nineteen-year-old speaker of Tayap formulated (5-17):(5-18) Akepre waraktakara, ŋgu wok
       Akep =re       warak -tak                -ara ŋgu wok
       Akep =loc talk.r -2sg.f|3sg.f.r -perf 3sg.f go.3sg.f.r
       ‘she finished talking to Akep, she left’In this speaker’s Tayap, what should be the coordinating suffix -api is instead
realized as the perfect suffix -ara. That such a substitution can occur is partly
because the younger speaker calques on Tok Pisin while speaking Tayap.
     In Tok Pisin, the word “pinis”, which derives from English ‘finish’, is both
an aspect marker and a clause-coordinating adverbial. As a marker of aspect, it
follows a verb to indicate completed action. So compare:
158         5 Basic verb morphology(5-19) mi go                          vs.   mi go pinis
       ‘I am going’ or ‘I went’             ‘I have gone’       ol i toktok                    vs.   ol i toktok pinis
       ‘they talk’ or ‘they talked’         ‘they’ve finished talking’As a clause-coordinating conjunction, “pinis” forms an utterance in itself and is
said with rising intonation:(5-20) Mipela toktok igo igo.       Pinis,     mipela i go nambaut
       we       talk    duration ‘finished’ we          go around
       ‘we spoke for a while and when we were finished talking, we went our
       separate ways’Young speakers of Tayap model their use of the perfect on these dual functions
of Tok Pisin’s “pinis” and they use the perfect suffix to signify both a completed
action and clause coordination. They even pronounce verbs onto which they have
suffixed the perfect suffix as they would the Tok Pisin equivalent with “pinis”, i.e.
they use the same rising intonation that they use when speaking Tok Pisin.","[176, 177, 178]"
