The first piece of evidence that most nouns are base-generated outside of the TPis that they are not sensitive to the ordering restrictions imposed by theUniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis (Baker 1988), which states that likethematic relations between items are represented by like structural                                                                                    399
7. The linkerrelationships. For example, in §3.3 finches, as patient of the verb examine, willalways be generated as the internal argument of the verb, whereas Charles, theagent of the verb examine, will always be generated as the external argument ofthe verb. This results in a strict SVO word order in English. In Gorwaa, thoughSOV word order is common enough to be considered canonical, Gorwaa nounsmay appear in any order relative to each other, and relative to the verb.","[399, 400]"

4.3.5 Wordhood: summaryTo summarize, four types of evidence were examined above in order to establishthe noun as a word: orthographic boundaries, pausa, word-internal phonologicaloperations, and indivisibility. Informal Gorwaa orthographies consistently placeboundaries between all lexical categories, but treat lexical categories withenclitics as one orthographic word. Pausa occur following subject nouns, but notobligatorily. Furthermore, no such pausa can be identified for object nouns.",[224]
"Next, the fuctional categories (determiners, selectors, and pronouns) areexamined (§2.4).     Moving on to clausal constituents, comment is made oncanonical word order, the verb phrase, the noun phrase, the adpositional phrase,as well as comparatives (§2.5). A section on pragmatically marked structuresincludes focus, contrast, topicalization, negation, and non-declarative speech acts(§2.6). The sketch ends with complex clauses: relatives and coordination (§2.7).",[73]

Locational nouns
Locational nouns serve a prepositional function. Typically derived from commonnouns (and very often body parts), they may occur postverbally as verb phraseadjuncts, and, when used with the prepositions ay (lative) and wa (ablative), serveto add locational precision. Some locational nouns are highly selective, and mustfollow other specific locational nouns. Others may occur in any order.

In 1977, an Iraqw translation of the Old Testament was produced by theTanzania Bible Society which employed a writing system developed principallyby the Catholic mission at Tlawi. As an appendix, a glossary of Gorwaa termswere included in order to make the book useable by the Gorwaa speakingChristian community as well. Though the book (nor Gorwaa-language worship)never became particularly widespread, it did establish the Iraqw writing systemas the standard for Gorwaa as well. With that said, a great diversity of non-standard writing conventions are in use (e.g. [20150815m], [20150920n],[20151001z], [20151127g], and [20151127h]), and the language is not verycommonly seen in written form.",[42]

The suffix 2: the listed phenomenaFurthermore, because the assignment of morphological case makes reference to thesyntactic structure (i.e. in assigning dative to the subject, and nominative to theremaining caseless NP), it must occur after the syntax, but be sensitive to it. It isargued that this post-syntactic stage is the morphology, which “takes a syntacticstructure as its input and incrementally alters that structure in order to produce aphonological form” (296). Thus, quirky case and those phenomena similar to it arecalled m-Case (m for morphological). Based on the argument that,crosslinguistically, it is m-Case (and not any syntactic relation such as grammaticalfunction) which determines the accessibility of a given NP for controlling agreementon the predicate, agreement must be a postsyntactic operation.","[379, 380]"

Within the larger architecture, this syntactic derivation represents one step inthe larger process. Following derivation, syntactic items are ‘spelled-out’, andsimultaneously transferred to the phonological component, where they receivepronunciation (List 2), and to the semantic component, where they receivemeaning (List 3). Harley’s (2014) model, based Halle and Marantz (1993), is aclassic representation.
leftmost element. This is the first time that such a configuration has been displayed, and
is essentially one of convenience, in that merging the elements in this way results in
finch-s, rather than -s finch and, therefore, eliminates the need for a Move operation.
Such a decision is not uncontroversial (see esp. Kayne 1994), but is licit under the rules
given up to this point (where the structure is sensitive to hierarchy, but not linear order).
This configuration will, in fact, suit the structure of the Gorwaa noun as well, and will be
employed throughout.","[208, 209]"

The position of the direct object nouns is best analyzed in relation to the selector-- a cluster of clitics which consistently occurs to the left of the lexical verb (see§2.4.2).
