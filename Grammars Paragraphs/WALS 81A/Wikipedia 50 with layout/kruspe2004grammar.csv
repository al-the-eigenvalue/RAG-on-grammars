"D. Constituent order Semelai exhibits the characteristic head-dependent word
order of the languages of mainland Southeast Asia: the attributive follows the noun (1)
(§7.4); the possessor follows the possessee (2)-(3) (§7.5); the preposition precedes
the noun (3)-(4) (§8), and relative clauses follow the head (5) (§11.1). At the phrase

9 Grammatical relations, constituent
   order and coding strategiesIn Chapter 9 the discussion centres around grammatical relations, constituent order
and coding strategies. In addition to the three grammatical relations A, S, O, a fourth
member, indirect object (10), is identified. The IO exhibits dual membership - it is
coded as an oblique in a prepositional phrase, but exhibits the syntactic behaviour
associated with a core role (§9.1.4).
  The most frequently employed constituent order is verb initial, with either A and
O, or S placed after the verb. Various pragmatically determined permutations are
possible, and these are outlined in §9.2.
  The coding of grammatical relations is dependent on the transitivity of the clause,
and it is in accordance with this distinction that they are discussed in §9.3.
  The minimal clause in Semelai consists of just the predicate. The means of
representation of NPs in the clause and zero anaphora are discussed in §9.4.","[274, 275]"
"
9.2 Constituent order
Constituent order in Semelai is neither fixed nor free, but fluid, allowing a range of
variations which are outlined below. Hence, constituent order alone does not encode
grammatical relations. In fact, a degree of ambiguity is frequently encountered and
semantic/pragmatic plausibility must be relied upon in order to determine
grammatical relations.
   There is, then, no single basic order in Semelai. Constituent order is determined
by the transitivity of the clause and the internal temporal structure of the event, in
conjunction with factors motivated by discourse organisation, e.g. the tendency for
new information to precede old. In the case of intransitive clauses obtained through
direct elicitation, S precedes the verb, while in transitive clauses there is a tendency
for verb initial structures. This is not always reflected in spontaneous discourse.
   The function of the variations in constituent order is to focus or foreground certain
constituents. An example is the role-marked pronominal S used post-verbally to
mark a change in direction in the discourse, or the end of a scene in a narrative. This
is illustrated in the following example where the woman has just given birth and
instructs the tiger to take the placenta and bury it. In the second line where the
woman has finished her statement, and in the final clause in the scene, the S follows
the predicate, rather than preceding it.

         (it) in the ground, he buried (it). He went back home.","[281, 282]"
"II. Ascriptive A particular property is ascribed to the referent. The complement
cannot comprise proper nouns or pronouns other than as possessors. This
distinguishes it from the equative and locative clause types.
(3)    bapa? sa?lan       [pl*$it]Pred
       father [name] [malefic.shamanjpred
       sa?lan's father (was) a malefic shaman.iii. Locative Locational clauses function to locate an entity. The locative clause
resembles the equative in that it contains two referring expressions. In the locative
clause the subject codes the locatee, and the predicate the location, expressed as a
PP.
(4)    dom,     kbd?=hn       [he?         *e]pred
       AFF      body=3POSS    [AT:above    there]pred
       Indeed, his body (was) up there.
Location is also expressed by the existential clause (§10.1.2.1).
10.1.1.1 General features of the clause type
Issues relating to constituent order, the subject, predicate, aspect and negation are
examined in the following sections.
i. Constituent order In equative and ascriptive clauses constituent order is
[Subject]-[Predicate] or [Predicate]-[Subject], determined by the constraints of the
representation of old versus new information, see §9.2. In the locative type the
ordering of constituents is fixed as location: locatee without regard to the new/old
distinction.(5)    ""[o?       ke] LOC     paya?"" khl*ij
       [AT: below that]LOc river         QUOTE
       ""Down there (is a) river,"" (he) said.",[298]
"Thompson and Longacre suggest that preference for ordering the adverbial clause in
initial position in some languages is evidence of a special constituent order. This
simply reflects a more general ordering in terms of the logical structure of the
relationship. The clause containing the connective is dependent, but it is only
dependent semantically as the secondary clause. This point is taken up below.",[408]
"Trivalent predicates containing all three arguments A, O and IO, in post-verbal
position, are not attested in spontaneous discourse, but are obtained under elicitation.
MI. Intransitive and non-verbal clauses In these clauses the NP may either precede
or follow the predicate. In (49) the clause is intransitive.(49)   k*hn [dkhes
       3S      [be.close house]pred
       He was close (to) the house.
In (50), the S of each verbal clause, the former active, the latter stative, follows the
predicate.
(50)   [ga^mddmtaed          [?eji]s, [bhih
       [IMM=lie.down]pred [lf] s       [be.full veryjpred [stomach]s
        I'm going to lie down, (my) stomach is really full.
  The constituents are ordered so that old information, represented by the NP,
precedes new information which is contained in the predicate. The foregrounding of
256     9 Grammatical relations, constituent order and coding strategies
new information places the predicate before the subject as in (50) above. For
non-verbal clauses the situation is analagous to the intransitive verbal clause:
(51)     ken     ha?      nerj     [lemon                   ye]pred
         3       AT       before [sibling's.offspring       l]pred
         He, here before (is) my nephew.","[283, 284]"
"The frequent partial representation and zero-representation o f arguments further
complicates a characterisation o f a basic constituent order. Many clauses consist
only of a verb, or verb and pronominal proclitic.
  In the following section the main generalisations about constituent order are
addressed, b e g i n n i n g with core arguments. Constraints on the ordering o f
case-marked N P s are dealt with in §§9.2.1-3. The pre-verbal 'fronted' position is
discussed in §9.2.3.",[282]
"The negator da? 'NEG' likewise only has scope over the clause in which it is marked,
as in (197).
380     11 Complex clauses11.5 Connective clauses
This section deals with the concatenation of clauses where the interclausal semantic
relationship is overtly marked - one clause contains a connective explicitly
indicating the causal, temporal or conditional connection between the two clauses.
The concatenation is considered a single complex construct, i.e. a sentence. It should
be noted that some of these relationships, temporal, simultaneous and conditional,
may also be expressed without the use of a lexical morpheme. Lexically unspecified
concatenation is discussed in §11.4.
   The same set of connectives is also used in interclausal relations as discourse
connectives. They provide textual cohesion, marking temporal relations between
consecutive independent clauses, for example marking back reference (§11.5.4).
   In the following discussion, there is no classification of the connectives in terms
of coordination or subordination as there is no evidence which allows the distinction
to be convincingly substantiated. For example, the criteria for subordination
suggested in Thompson and Longacre (1985) are the presence of: a) a grammatical
morpheme, b) a special verb form and c) special word order. Semelai exhibits only
the first of these characteristics, the morpheme. What would appear to be reduced
verb forms are in fact simply standard cases of discourse-motivated elision as in the
first two clauses in (221), and there is no evidence of changes in constituent order in
the adverbial clause, as in (221)-(222). (Constituent order in basic clauses is
discussed in §9.2.)(221)    de=yok       jalu,    yok     creh,    de=ca.

         They took pork (and) took fish (and) they ate (it). After they ate (it), they left the
         house.

         After (it's) winnowed, put (it) in the mortar again.","[407, 408]"
"  The word order of the interrogative clause depends on the syntactic relations
between the constituent and the predicate. It is common cross-linguistically for the
ignorative to be in initial position, and this is generally the case in Semelai, in
particular amongst the basic ontological categories of THING, PERSON, PLACE (295),
REASON, MANNER, QUANTITY (296) and TIME. For further examples see §6.2.(295)     ""hon      ?ma?     hne?"" khler)

"4.1 Introductory remarks
The majority of lexemes in Semelai can be assigned unproblematically to a
particular word class. Lexemes must undergo derivational procedures in order to
function in a different word class. Verbs generally require 'deverbalising' before
being able to function as a syntactic noun, either by morphological nominalisation:
yok —> nk-yok (NMZ-take) 'taking', or syntactic nominalisation hitam: 'to be black'
—»md=hitam (REL=be.black) 'the black one'.
  Nouns undergo verbalising processes in order to function as verbs, e.g. bnih
'seed' —> b<h>nih (seed<lMPERF>) 'to sow rice seed'; baju? 'clothes' —> p-baju?
(EQUiP-clothes) 'to dress (s.o.)'. In other words, any non-prototypical function of a
lexeme will be either morphologically or syntactically marked (see Table 4.1). In
some cases there is more than one strategy available.

   (property)     md=rmDl 'the male one'
   (action)          n?-go? 'felling'      br-go? 'felled'       go? 'to fell a tree'   There is a small set of bound roots which exhibit idiosyncratic behaviour (§5.2.2).
They are associated primarily with verbal derivatives, e.g. Vyup (sleep covered)
yp-yup 'to sleep with a cover'. However, the root may also be used in conjunction
with a noun to form a nominal compound, without first being nominalised. This is
atypical for an associative phrase of this type (§7.5). Compare kayen yup (cloth
(sleep covered)) 'sleeping cover' with the compound for 'drinking water' dak
j<nh>?oh (water drink<NMZ>). Until further investigation is undertaken, it is
                                                                     4.1 Introductory remarks      95difficult to ascertain whether these are indeed verbal roots, or if they have some sort
of precategorial status.
   For the most part, the lexemes which present problems to the system in terms of
multifunctionality are loanwords from Malay, e.g. turjkDt 'stick', turjkDt 'to prop
up', where there appears to be a case of zero conversion operating between the word
classes of noun and verb. The treatment I give to such lexemes is to posit a case of
heterosemy.1 Not all loanwords behave in this manner, and many, like krja? 'to
work', need to undergo overt derivational change, e.g. krja? 'to work' —»k<n>rja?
'work, task'. In the domain of indigenous Semelai lexemes, zero conversion usually
only takes place within subclasses of a main class, e.g. transitivity shifts such as the
labile verb ph«l 'to come down, intr./to come down (s.th.), tr.', or shifts from main
verbs to supplemental verbs or adverbs, e.g. ?ayon 'to be slow' and adverbial
'slowly'.
   We will now examine the general features of class membership in Semelai. The
major contrast is between open and closed word classes. Within this division, it may
be possible to further organise the membership into minor classes identifiable on the
basis of combinatorial possibilities. Not all distinctions at this level of minor
classification necessarily signal different word class membership.
   An open class is distinguished by the following criteria:
    a)   It will have a potentially unlimited number of members, and thus can be
         freely added to.
    b)   It may have the potential to feed derivational processes which function
         productively to augment the membership of the class to which the form
         belongs, e.g. causative derivation of the verb ca 'to eat (s.th.)' —> pan-ca 'to
         feed (s.th.) to (s.o.)' (§5.3.6).
    c)   It may contain subclasses which are themselves closed, e.g. the verb class
         contains a subclass of eight dimension adjectives (§4.2.2). Classes which
         exhibit finite membership are grouped within the open class on the basis of
         primary criteria, e.g. the potential to function as the head of a verb phrase.
    d)   The members of an open class are generally free lexemes.
    A closed class can be distinguished by the following characteristics:
    a)   It has a finite number of members and thus cannot generally be added to.
    b)   It does not contain items which result from the application of derivational
         processes to members of the open word classes. In general, the members of
         the class do not have the potential to feed derivational processes (for
         exceptions see second person pronouns (§5.4.3.3), and the locative
         prepositions (§6.3.1.2).","[122, 123]"
"   The one exception in the corpus where the object is a constituent of the second
clause and is in final position is given in (216). The motivation behind this is not
clear, although it may be that the speaker wants to represent a more unified action
and chooses to manipulate the order in this manner.",[407]
"Interrogatives based on the ignorative nmoh 'what class' (§6.2.2.1) exhibit the
reverse order [Predicate]-[Subject]:
(7)    p?la?   nmDh?
       animal INDIV:what
       Of which class (is that) animal?ii. The subject The subject can be any nominal expression (§7.1), e.g. a noun as
in (8), or a deictic as in (9). The subject of the NVC is coded in the same manner as
the S of an intransitive clause: nouns and first and second person pronouns are
unmarked (8); third person pronouns are in the S-forms kahn '3S' and dehn *3plS'
(§9.3.2).",[299]
"  If the object in the complement (34), or adjunct (35), is not possessed by a core

"   While all complements, core and oblique, share the feature of being
subcategorised by the verb, one type of complement, the recipient, shares features of
the syntactic behaviour typical of core relations such as relativisation, fronting and
optionality of the case marker in certain contexts. The recipient is coded by a
locative preposition (§8.3.3), and is considered a fourth core grammatical relation
indirect object. Verbs which subcategorise for a recipient are verbs of transfer, e.g.
jon 'to give' and h?gi? 'to give'; and of verbs of oral communication, ?ur ?en 'to
instruct (s.o.)', paryeq ha? 'to inform (s.o.)'.
  Recipients are similar to complements, in being semantically restricted, but also
share features typical of an oblique, most importantly the ability to make an
independent semantic contribution by encoding the spatial distinction contained in
the deictic locative series (§8.5):

"9J.I    Core relations
Core grammatical relations are necessarily subcategorised by the verb. These are
characterised in terms of grammatical relations as A, O and S (Dixon 1994), as well
as IO. A is the argument of a transitive clause which is prototypically an agent; O,
the argument of a transitive clause which is prototypically a patient; and S, the single
argument of an intransitive clause and the 'subject' of a non-verbal clause. An S
takes A-like marking under conditions of external causation, to be discussed in
§9.3.3. Semantically core relations tend to be unrestricted in that they may reflect a
range of semantic roles. Thus, the grammatical relation A may be realised as an
agent (1), or an experiencer of perceptual/aural stimuli, as in (2), according to the
verb lexeme involved. A is the most restricted of the core relations in terms of
permitted reference: the A must always be animate, the only exceptions being
certain potent natural phenomena (§5.5.1).

"  When the Semelai enter the jungle to hunt, collect forest products, or prepare a
swidden, it is imperative to employ this speech style. The jungle is seen as fraught
with peril, so in order to avoid the danger of attack from ska?, 'malevolent spirits',
this taboo is used. Failure to do so can result in a range of afflictions including
soul-loss. Other consequences are falling victim to a tiger, crocodile, snake or
centipede.
  The avoidance style also exhibits variation connected to particular locations. In
locations of peril, especially those connected to significant events in the creation of
Tasek Bera, terms specific to the area are used. In the area of the Tembangau River,
one must use cDkop thmagd (speak Tembangau), where twar 'fish trap' is rhnoh,
the fish species tumok is called jalay and?us 'fire' ispnrag, not sma? gdo (person
be.old).
        1 Semelai
  Some speakers also extend the use of the avoidance speech style to the home, to
prevent the intrusion of snakes or centipedes.
  Although avoidance speech styles of this type are common amongst Aslian groups
(see Diffloth 1980, and Benjamin in prep.), speech styles of this type are not
exclusive to Aslian languages. The Austronesian-speaking collectors of the
camphorwood found in Sumatra and Borneo and the southern part of the Malay
Peninsula also used styles of this type. Skeat and Blagden (1906) dedicated a whole
chapter to this particular linguistic feature.
   Skeat and Blagden noted the significance of such speech styles: ""The root-idea in all
these languages is simple enough: it is merely the avoidance, in an indeterminate
number of cases of the ordinary everyday word, and the substitution of something
different and out of the common. The primary motive is ... a respectful fear of the
superior powers, human, natural or supernatural, as the case may be ..."" (1906: 417).
   While many Aslian languages have avoidance-type speech styles (Semai (Diffloth
1980); Cheq Wong and Jah Hut (Kruspe fieldnotes)), they are usually confined to the
lexical replacement of nouns as in (15). Semelai is unusual in extending this to include
verbs (G. Benjamin, N. Burenhult, G. Diffloth, p . c ) , see (16).","[35, 36]"
"   Lexically represented objects which are shared by the clauses show up in the first
clause in the sequence, in post-verbal position. Although both OV and VO are
allowable orders in the simple clause (§9.2.1), the preferred pattern in concatenated
clauses appears to be VO:(214)    ki=khom      creh,     ki=gorj     ?yot
         3A=get       fish      3A=bring return
         He caught fish (and) he took (them) home.",[406]
"In the transitive imperative clause the case of the core grammatical relations O and
IO (§§9.3.1.2-3) is not overtly coded, and it occurs, like the addressee, as a bare NP
(319). In (320) the IO is ?aji T and the O is md=bje? 'one piece'. Usually the IO of
a verb of transfer is coded by a locative preposition. Here, it resembles the

        give=IMP2        If      one=CLF
        Give me one!
  The word order of the imperative clause is usually verb initial, followed by core
arguments, the addressee, and finally by any complements. The post-verbal NP in
the following example is ambiguous between an O and an addressee:
(321)   dom       jrpk=cd?            ??€?!
        AFF       look.at=lMP!        EB
        Yes indeed, look at (it) elder brother!",[361]
"9.2.1     Core arguments
The position of the arguments depends on the clause type. There are three basic
structures: (i) the universal clause, (ii) the perfective clause and (iii) intransitive and
non-verbal clauses.
i. The Universal Clause If the transitive clause is a universal or generic statement,
constituent order is A V O, neither A nor O is case-marked and the verb does not
host a cross-referencing proclitic (§9.3.1.1).
(41)     podorj ca       sma?
         tiger eat        people
         Tigers eat people.
(42)     par-kon    suka? knkon
         xs-child like      child.
         A 'parksn' (is someone who) likes (other people's) children.
In (43) and (44), the NPs do not have specific referents; the clauses describe the
setting or background against which events unfold.
(43)     sma? pok         rbana?
         person beat drum
         People were beating drums.
                                                                 9.2 Constituent order   255In (44) the speaker is not talking about a specific instantiation of an event, but rather
a habitual activity.

        person be.white throw ration SRC             AT      aeroplane
        The Europeans threw rations from (their) aeroplanes.","[282, 283]"
"11.5.1 General features of connectives
The clause containing the connective tends to be the initial clause. Concatenated
clauses containing connectives display one feature distinguishing them from the
concatenated clause type in §11.4 - the ability to interchange the order of clauses
where this is semantically plausible.
  The connective is always the initial constituent in the clause. It is usually a single
word, although there is one phrasal temporal connective ?luc tarn (pass from)
'after'. In terms of etymology, only two categories are expressed by Semelai
                                                                  11.5 Connective clauses   3 81morphemes: cause and condition; the majority of connectives are borrowed from
Malay.
  The trend for connectives or conjunctions to be borrowed from the dominant
national language is noted for a number of languages in Thompson and Longacre
(1985: 204-5). It is not possible to comment why this is so for Semelai, other than to
note that in nearly all cases where there is a Malay form, there is no Semelai
equivalent. The absence of these overt markers is not remarkable in itself as it is an
expected areal feature. In most cases, this type of information is inferable, see §11.4.
In fact, many of the terms borrowed from Malay are in turn borrowings from other
languages, and many of these relationships can also be expressed in Malay without
the use of a conjunction, e.g. a conditional clause may be expressed either
paratactically - ada kereta dia pergi (be car he go) '(If) there is a car he will go', or
with a connective kalau ada kereta dia pergi (if be car he go) 4If there is a car he
will go'. It is also interesting to note that in the purposive clause (§11.4.1.2) for
instance, the Malay conjunctions have not been borrowed into Semelai.
  There is not always a match between the form and function of the borrowed term.
There are instances where borrowings from Malay have semantic innovations in
Semelai, which as far as can be ascertained are not attested in Malay. Consider the
temporal kna? 'when' (§11.5.2.3). kena 'to affect (s.th.)' is a Malay verb, the use of
which is often associated with external imposition or adversity toward the thing
affected. The usage of kna? in (225) 4it happened that when' 7 as a connective is not
found in Malay. Likewise sampai 'until', a conjunction in Malay, functions also as a
discourse connective sampay 'so that; so, at that point' in Semelai (§11.5.3). Both
of the Malay usages of these words are attested in Semelai, kna? 'to affect (s.th.)'
(223), and sampay 'until' (224).(223)    dom ?ma?        ke    kna? kse?
         AFF mother that affect trap
         Indeed, the mother (had been) caught (by) the trap.

         lMM=MID-hang until            die
         (They) are going to be hung until (they) are dead.(225) is an example of both lexemes in their respective connective functions.
(225)    sampay kna? thdy            ?us, ki=reg         dbrj
         so        when be.big fire 3A=seek stick
         So, when (it happened that) the fire was burning well, she sought a stick.","[408, 409]"
"E. Morphosyntax        The syntactic typology of Semelai displays an intricate mix of
features based on a basic transitive/perfective-intransitive/imperfective contrast.
   Semelai exhibits both head and dependent marking, e.g. the head-marking
pronominal proclitics on the transitive verb and the dependent-marking proclitics on
post-verbal arguments which are introduced below.
   Core grammatical relations are marked by a system of clitic cross-referencing in the
transitive clause. The A is cross-referenced by a pronominal proclitic on the verb (6),
and proclitic la= 'A' on the optional post-verbal NP. A system of differential object
marking optionally encodes the object N P with proclitic h n = 'O'. The O is not
cross-referenced on the verb, see example (6).
   In the intransitive clause, the subject NP does not exhibit role marking, with the
exception of the third person pronominal forms which have a fused enclitic hn 'S':
kehn '3S' (< keh=hn 3=S), dehn '3plS' (< deh=hn 3pl=S). As with O, S is not
cross-referenced on the verb, see example (9) above.",[33]
"   The clausal constituents, the categories NP, PP and VP, have fixed internal order,
and any change in that order reflects a change in the meaning. In (39) the PP must
remain adjacent to the NP, otherwise it loses its modifying function, and is
interpreted instead as a circumstantial locative (40).

11 Complex clausesIn this chapter, syntax at the level above the simple clause is examined, in other
words, sentences comprising combinations of simple clauses. Relative clauses,
where a clause modifies a noun, are discussed in §11.1. This is followed by a
discussion of complementation, where a complement clause fills a core argument
position, A, S or O, in a higher clause (§11.2). The discussion then turns to the three
constructions where a clause functions to modify a VP or a proposition: serial verb
constructions (§11.3), the concatenation of independent clauses (§11.4), and
connective clauses (§11.5).
   An areal feature of South-east Asian languages is the general absence of formal
signalling to code the conjoining or embedding of clauses in complex constructions,
resulting in a low level of structural difference. For the most part, in Semelai the
various complex sentences simply consist of the unmarked paratactic and, to a lesser
extent, the hypotactic concatenation of two or more clauses. Note that although the
distinction can be difficult to establish in certain cases, there is in principle a
distinction between the simple concatenation of independent clauses (§11.4) and
serialised verb constructions (§11.3).
   A note is in order on the analytic means of distinguishing the covertly combined
clauses. Decisions were made in accordance with the intuitions of the Semelai
speakers, phrase and clause level pauses, and intonation contours.","[366, 367]"
"The alternative orderings would be interpreted with a consecutive reading, and not a
co-temporal one. Note the commas which indicate the necessary intonation
boundary required for the concatenated interpretation:(124)    ki=gorj     la=bapa?=hn,         paloh knon=hn
         3A=take A=father=3POSS            flee     offspring=3POSS
         His father took (it) (and) (his) child fled.(125)    ki=goij     la=bapa?=hn         knon=hn,            paloh
         3A=take A=father=3POSS offspring=3POSS              flee
         His father took his child (and they) fled .c) The two verbs which form the SVC must share the same set of arguments. There
can be potentially only one subject and one object, where applicable, per SVC.d) Oblique NPs pertain to the SVC as a whole:(126)    ki=gon      ?yot    he?         dol
         3A=bring return AT: above house
         She took (him) back up to the house.e) Modification in terms of negation, aspect or modality is never ambiguous, since
the modifier always has scope over both verbs, as with goi) and masak in (127).(127)    da? dapat         ye=goij       masak
         NEG manage lA=bring cook
         (It) wasn't possible (that) I engage (myself in) cooking.f) The maximal number of verbs attested in a serial complex is two. In (128), the
third verb belongs to the following concatenated clause, reflected by an intonation
break and indicated in the text by the presence of the comma.(128)    ki=goi)      lumpDt,       paloh      ?a=keh      no? nei)
         3A=bring leap            flee         DET=3        this before
         He took (it) leaping, (and) fled/(in order to) flee, the aforementioned him.

pragmatic ambiguity unlike that of concatenated clauses, see §11.4.","[390, 391]"
"The second pattern is to encode the causer as the subject, and the causee/beneficiary
as a prepositional complement (208)-(209). Despite the prepositional phrase, the
derived verb functions like a normal transitive verb, attracting subject proclitics:

         amidst the ground.)(209)    She equipped them with a stick. The blind husband held onto one end, she took the

         She provided (them) with a stick, one end to him, the other end to herself.",[184]
"11.3.2.3 Purposive motion
In the Purposive motion SVC the supplementary verb, which is a verb of motion, is
followed by an intransitive or a transitive verb. The second verb is the principal verb
given that it determines the overall transitivity of the clause.
   The actions are not co-temporal in the sense that they are not necessarily
simultaneous; however recalling the characterisation of the SVC in §11.3.1 the
construction represents two facets of one event, and not two independent events. The
purposive motion SVC involves the expression of directed motion required in order
for the subject to be in the right location to carry out the activity of the principal
verb.",[398]
"7.6.2.2 The syntactic behaviour of nominalised forms
Lexical nominalisations, like other nouns, form the heads of NPs, and occur in
environments typical of this word class, e.g. as objects of prepositions (98), subjects
of minor clauses (99), constituents in the associative phrase, either as the head (100)
or the modifier (101), and in the formation of some interrogative clauses, e.g.
'whose' interrogatives (§10.5.2).

"   Clitics modify a word in relation to phrasal or configurational properties by adding
information relevant to its syntactic slot, e.g. the clitic hn= 'O' indicates that the
following noun is a direct object, see (§3.3.4).",[92]
"II. Constituent order The two possible orderings of constituents in the existential
clause are motivated by the representation of old/new information. If the existent NP
represents new information, it follows the predicator da? NP (LOC); if the NP
represents old information, e.g. in response to a question, it precedes the predicator:
NP da? (LOC). In both instances, the LOC is in clause-final position.
   NP final order is used for non-specific NPs to introduce a new NP (32) or, with an
established participant, to introduce a new event or state (33).(32)   ""?ma? ye=?en"" khlerj, ""khoy nehneh. da?                     da?     kba?""

9.3 Coding strategies
In this section two basic strategies for coding syntactic function will be examined in
relation to the core roles S, A, O and IO: a) cross-referencing, and b) NP-marking.
Table 9.1 summarises the marking patterns discussed in the following sections.
   A, the subject of the transitive clause, is coded by the proclitic la= 'A' on all
pronouns and nouns, with the exception of inanimate nouns which are not eligible to
be an A. (Note that A is simultaneously cross-referenced on the verb; neither S nor
O are cross-referenced.) S, the subject of the intransitive clause, is unmarked except
for the third person pronominal forms, which have distinctive absolutive forms. O,
the object of a transitive clause, optionally hosts the proclitic hn= *O' across all NPs
including third person pronominals.

"73.2 Classifiers
Classifiers are typically associated with the quantification of entities. Two systems
of classification operate in Semelai. One is the system of numeral classifiers which
are mostly terms borrowed from Malay;3 the other is an indigenous system which
can function either with a numeral as a numeral classifier, or independent of numeral
classification as an 'individuator' (§7.6.1.1).
   The set of classifiers in Semelai is small and rigid, and their use is not obligatory.
The small inventory does not result in many entities employing the same classifier,
but rather that many entities are simply not associated with a classifier. Although
this topic requires further examination, it would appear that the optionality of the
classifier in Semelai is based in its function. Hence, the assertion can be made that2
  There are no restrictions on the combinatorial possibilities of borrowed and indigenous terms in
Mah Meri where the two combine freely: muy balas (one ten) 'eleven' (Kruspe fieldnotes).
Restrictions are attested in Jah Hut where the two indigenous numerals ni 'one' and nar 'two' can
only be used in conjunction with indigenous terms. With numbers greater than two, the indigenous
noun is replaced by a borrowed term: nar knts? 'two days', but tiga? hari 'three days' (Diffloth
1976c: 99-100).
3
  The optionality of Mon-Khmer classifiers has led to a belief that their presence in Mon-Khmer is
due to the influence of surrounding languages like Chinese and Thai. For classifiers in Mon-Khmer
languages see (Adams 1986,1989).
                                                                      7.3 The quantifier phrase      207the function of classifiers in Semelai is not only to individuate entities in order to
count them - this is in fact marginal given that not all entities are associated with
classifiers, and of those that are, flexibility obtains - but individuation is a means of
establishing referentiality, and providing anaphoric reference,4 see (3) and (22)
above. The numeral ma= 'one' co-occurs most frequently with the classifiers.
   We will examine the borrowed classifiers first, followed by the indigenous terms.
Some examples of borrowed classifiers are listed below:
         ?ikur     'animates: human, non-human'
         bje?      'three dimensional objects: fruits, eggs, houses, hills, rivers'
         bidarj    'things that are spread out: mats, thatch'
         hlay      'length of fabric, strand of hair'
         buku?     'lump: earth, congealed rubber'
         rntarj    'oral narrative'The two most striking differences from Malay usage of these classifiers are the use
in Semelai of ?ikur to denote 'any animate entity, including people', see (26),
whereas in Malay ekor 'tail' is used only for 'animals', e.g. dog, monkey, bird, fish,
insect;5 secondly, the classifier bje? <— biji 'seed', the Malay classifier for small
round objects, is collapsed with the Malay classifer buah 'fruit*, used for objects of
indefinite size or shape, resulting in one basic classifier bje? for three dimensional
objects, see (17), (20) and (27).
  In (26), the classifier follows the noun and the two numeral expressions function
anaphorically.
(26)     kah,     ki=khDm     pon       ?ikur,   dwa?     kdor,         dwa?      rmol        sdom

         Him, he got four (of them), just two (who) were female, (and) two (who) were
         male.
  The fact that the classifiers are based on the semantics of shape allows them to be
used to express relative dimension as in the following example:
(27)     ny-they
         NMZ-be.big one=CLF house
         (It was) the width (of) a house.","[234, 235]"

4.2 Open classes4.2.7 Nominals
The following word classes are subsumed under a 'nominal' superclass: noun,
numeral, pronoun, demonstrative and ignorative.
  Nominals are free lexical roots which have the ability to head a noun phrase (NP).
The primary member of the group is the open class of nouns which function
referentially to indicate an entity. The major syntactic function is as arguments of
predicates.
  Numerals represent an open class (§4.2.1), although within this class there is a
small closed class of indigenous terms.
  Pronouns, demonstratives and ignoratives (§4.2.1) are all closed classes. The first
two are distinguished by their ability to function as determiners, while all three
classes are distinguished in terms of their ability to head an NP.
4.2.1.1 Nouns
The main function of the noun is as an argument of a verb. They occur as phrasal
constituents at the head of an NP (§7.2). Typically, nouns appear with a
referentialising phrase (§7.3), an attributive phrase (§7.4) or an associative phrase
(§7.5). They may also mark relationships between nouns, e.g. in an associative
phrase, or a possessive phrase, e.g. pjiam do ?eji (NMZ-feel OF If) 'my opinion'
(§8.9). As the arguments of verbs, they may host role marking proclitics (§9.1).
   A marginal function of nouns is the predicative function (§10.1). Nominal
predicates are distinguished from verbal predicates by virtue of the fact that they do
not subcategorise, and with the exception of the imminent aspect clitic ga= 'IMM',
do not co-occur with aspectual adverbs.
   Nouns can be identified as either proper or common, which affects the manner in
which they are modified. Proper nouns have unique reference and therefore are
neither modified by attributives nor co-occur with quantifiers or demonstratives,
although they may include a title, e.g. puyorj jo?an 'shaman jD?an'. Kin terms are
used to both refer to and address people, and may be modified by either a
demonstrative or a locative phrase or another kin term or pronoun: ?uda? 'parent's
third-born female sibling'; pa?.qah he? jlawat 'parent's second-born male sibling
98    4 Word classes
up at jlawat', kmsn ye 'my sibling's offspring'. Common nouns may refer to a
single entity: maleg 'sky'; a set: ?ma?.bapa? 'parents', or a mass: garr>m 'salt'. This
restricts the range of constituents which can co-occur with the noun. Mass nouns, for
example gar Dm 'salt', cannot be individuated other than as a measured quantity:
garDm md=c<pn>?um (salt one=wrap<NMZ>) 'one package of salt' (§7.3). Generic
or superordinate nouns, e.g. cim 'bird', have derived forms which specify a lower
order set or individual referent, e.g. nm-cim (iNDiv-bird) 'kind of bird' (§7.6.1).
Some examples of nouns are given below.
   Proper nouns include: place names, thmaqdr 'Tembangau River'; individual
person's names (these are rarely used), lee 'a woman's name', lagkorj 'a man's
name', rsmgasi 'the name of an ogre'; nicknames, paypay 'a man's nickname'.
   Kin terms include: ?i?e? 'elder male cousin', wa?.mbor) 'parent's eldest sibling
(male)',busu? 'youngest-born sibling', ?ipar 'sibling-in-law' (§1.3.3.2).
   Common nouns may have concrete objects as their referents, e.g. humans (sma?
'person') including kin (?ma?.bapa? 'parents') and other relationships (b?l«?
'unrelated friend'); afterlife forms (kmuc 'ghost'); artefacts (luk 'quiver for
blowpipe darts', lat 'dam barrier'); body parts (tdrj 'ear, place where handle is
attached to a basket', suk 'hair, feather, fur'); rituals (tpuq tawar (flour exchange)
'""flour"" healing ritual'); environmental features (bri 'jungle', slcgoc 'channel');
flora (bkaw 'flower', sake? 'pandanus'); fauna (co 'dog', yuyuy 'gnat'); celestial
bodies (bulan 'moon'); meteorological phenomena (musim 'season', tijD rbM
(snake aroid) 'rainbow'); times (som 'morning'); and quantities and measures
(k<nx>pi 'tinful' <—kopi 'tin').
   Nouns with abstract referents are usually derived from verbs, e.g. abstracts of
dimension like nsjias 'height' <— ?jias 'to be high' or other properties like p<t>ret
'heat' <— pret 'to be hot', and concepts like s<n>u<i)>mt>i) 'act of incest' <— sumDi)
'to commit incest'. In general such abstract concepts, in particular actions and
feelings, cannot be expressed by nouns, but require expression as full clausal
statements.
   Deverbal nouns (§7.6.2) do not generally function as arguments of verbs, but may
function either as a subject (1), or a predicate of non-verbal clauses (2), or in
possessive interrogatives (§10.5).

PrefaceThis is a description of Semelai, an Aslian language spoken by some 4,000 people in
Peninsular Malaysia. The present book is a revision of my doctoral dissertation
submitted to the University of Melbourne in 1999. The study is based on a corpus of
data collected during an initial period of fieldwork undertaken from July 1990 to June
1991 at Tasek Bera, in the state of Pahang. Insights from recent visits in 2000-1, whilst
a postdoctoral student at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in
Leipzig, Germany, have also been included. Revisions have been completed during a
post-doctoral fellowship at the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology, La Trobe
University, Melbourne, Australia.
   First and foremost, this book represents an initial step in the documentation of a
unique and complex language, in an area which to date has been largely neglected by
linguists.
   My main consideration in writing this grammar was to provide a lucid and accessible
account of Semelai for linguists of all theoretical persuasions. The language is described
in terms of Basic Linguistic Theory. I have sought to treat equally all aspects of the
grammar, examining form and meaning and providing semantic motivations for the
various distinctions made within it. A generous number of examples and texts are
included to illustrate the discussion and to create a reference work, which will be of use
to descriptivists and typologists alike. The discussion of the grammar is contextualised
with reference to other languages and comparative notes are included where possible.
The analysis is supported by references to literature on issues of theoretical and
typological relevance.
   When I first set out to write this description, the meagre resources available only
hinted at what was to come. Each advance was - reflecting Diffloth's sentiments with
regard to writing a description of Jah Hut - 'a step in the unknown' (1976c). This book
provides a model of grammatical description for future researchers in this region. In
addition, it will benefit typologists by providing empirical data for an area under-
represented in cross-linguistic studies.
   With this book I hope to draw attention to the Aslian languages and advance our
knowledge not only of Aslian, but also of Mon-Khmer linguistics in general. Tucked
away at the end of a vast continent, Semelai and the other Aslian languages represent an
outlier of Austroasiatic, the oldest phylum present in mainland Southeast Asia. They
hold an important place for our understanding of the linguistic typology of the region
and the study of Southeast Asian prehistory.
   A few points are required on the method of data collection. The technique employed
was to work monolingually with a cross-section of the community, collecting narratives
                                                                                         Preface    xviiin a range of genres. I worked on a daily basis with normah het, who became not only
my principal informant, but also my friend. Her willingness to accept me into her
family circle and allow me to participate in their daily life consolidated my knowledge
of the Semelai language. Not only did normah provide me with language data, she also
introduced me to her wider family and encouraged them to assist me in the collection of
lexical and textual materials. Textual materials were also provided by the following
people: ?amay isa - whose prolific knowledge of traditional narratives, and passion for
relating them, despite her age and ill-health, was astounding; pa?ijah jahudi provided
traditional narratives; normah's mother k:>p, in addition to traditional narratives,
recounted events from her childhood and the Communist Emergency; the late brahim
of Kampong Jelawat, galenah, her eldest son kassim and the late nari, also had much
to offer.
   Text collection was usually undertaken in a group setting, at the suggestion of the
narrator, who felt that an interactive audience was a necessary and important component
of the performative retelling of traditional narratives. Audience interaction ranged from
interjections and non-verbal gestures, to direct comments and questions. This context of
spontaneous conversation proved useful for data collection. Direct elicitation of
language materials was kept to a minimum, employed only to clarify phenomena in the
texts, or to work through infrequent or poorly understood structures. Unless otherwise
noted, all examples in this grammar come from the collected texts. A selection of texts
is found in §14.
   The texts were transcribed and annotated primarily with the assistance of normah.
These sessions took place in the afternoons when groups of people gather on each
others' verandahs. These group settings, which included people of all ages from
different settlements, provided a forum of spontaneous and often lively debate which
greatly increased my understanding of the language. In my translation and
commentaries I have tried to capture some of the spirit of these engagements and the
culture of the Semelai.
The reader should note that examples are numbered separately within each chapter;
cross-references to examples are only made within individual chapters.
   Semelai is not a written language. The orthography used here is phonemic, and
follows Benjamin (1976b) and Diffloth (1976c) employing the standard IPA symbols
with the following exceptions: IPA / j / , / j / and / s / are replaced by / y / , / j / and / s / , and
/rrj/, /q/ and /q/ are represented as the digraphs /hm/, /hn/ and /hq.
   The initial letter of Semelai personal names and place names is not capitalised in
accordance with IPA conventions.
   The language/ethnic names of some Aslian groups are not standardised. I have
maintained the spelling found in the original document. The following variants are
noted: Besisi/Mah Meri; Jahai/Jehai; Kensiu/Kensiw; Kentaq Bong/Kintaq Bong and
Semaq Beri/Semoq Beri.
Acknowledgements
Without the acceptance of the Semelai community this work would not have been
possible. It is out of respect for them that I persisted with this research. It is impossible
to acknowledge every one who assisted in teaching me Semelai, for every exchange
provided a contribution to my knowledge of their language. I am especially indebted to
my primary informant normah het for her friendship; to her extended family, and in
particular her mother kop, for their hospitality and assistance in my endeavour; to my
neighbours at Kampong Gau and their extended families, borhan pipin, ma2nah krdor,
the late mntri? ?abas, the late nari and noriah nari. I would also like to thank 2amir
wadi for the hours he spent with me in the early days; the people at Kampong Jelawat
who always welcomed my visits; the residents of Kampong               Putat pa?gah    jahudi,
?amay isa and jimpang and layon who spent many hours enthusiastically retelling oral
narratives for my benefit, and matnor sujin, ?2on, tatey, raizan maris, rohana
2inolan, shamsuddin gosi and the late brahim. I am also indebted to Bah Tony
Williams-Hunt who generously found time to provide me with an introduction to the
community, and to 2atim padot and family for making their home available during my
initial field trip.
   This research would not have been possible without the permission of the
Government of Malaysia and the State of Pahang, to whom I am grateful. I would also
like to thank the Jabatan Hal Ehwal Orang Asli, in particular Mohd. Sayed Abdullah,
and   Puan   Munirah   Abd.   Manan,   Economic    Planning   Unit,   The   Prime   Minister’s
Department. Thanks are also due to Professor Asmah Haji Omar, Universiti Malaya,
and Professors Hood Salleh and Shamsul Amri Baharuddin, Universiti Kebangsaan
Malaysia, for their assistance and support in Malaysia.
   My principal supervisor, Nicholas Evans, first suggested the Aslian languages as an
area for research. Nick’s enthusiasm, challenging criticisms and perceptive observations
were invaluable in shaping this work, enabling me to finally find order amidst chaos.
   I have greatly appreciated the contributions of Mark Durie, Bill McGregor and Jean
Mulder, who took over supervision at various periods over the years. 1 have also
benefited from discussions with Geoffrey Benjamin, James T. Collins, Gerard Diffloth,
Ilia Peiros and Niclas Burenhult, and from the considered comments and
encouragement of my examiners, the series editors Bob Dixon and Keren Rice and the
anonymous reviewer from Cambridge University Press. I would also like to thank Sasha
Aikhenvald for her support and encouragement.
   Formatting was initially done by Erich Round, before Adam Bowles took over.
Adam’s valuable suggestions and attention to detail in preparing the manuscript are
greatly appreciated. The maps were drawn by Chandra Jayasuriya.

Typology, La Trobe University, provided generous financial and institutional support at
various stages of this project.
  To my friends and family who have provided me with moral and practical support
over the years, I am deeply grateful. Too many years and too many people have passed
by for me to thank every one, but particular thanks go to Alec Coupe, Catriona Hyslop,
Andrew Ingram and Janet Sharp for their encouragement and practical assistance in the
final stages, and to Anthony Jukes and Tonya Stebbins.

1 SemelaiSemelai is an Aslian language belonging to the Mon-Khmer division of Austroasiatic.
It is spoken by approximately 4,103 people in Peninsular Malaysia around the shores
of Tasek Bera, along the banks of the Bera, Teriang and Serting rivers in south-west
Pahang and north-west Negeri Sembilan states, and the Muar River in north-west
Johore (see Maps).1
   As with all Aslian languages, there is no written tradition, or recorded history, other
than oral based.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]"
"622 THING
The range of choices available for expressing the ontological category THING are
mandehmoh, and its variants hmoh, dmoh and jmoh. These are used with
non-human animate, inanimate and abstract referents in interrogative contexts to
seek knowledge about identity. Only mandehmDh is used in indefinite contexts.
   Although mandehmoh appears to be morphologically complex, a compound of
mande 'what sort o f and hmoh, it is difficult to provide an insightful analysis,
whilst being unable to draw a semantic distinction between mandehmoh and its
variant forms. The general unavailability of the form to be used in indefinite
contexts does suggest that it is complex, although this observation may reflect a gap
in the corpus rather than being a valid claim about the functional possibilities of the
term.
6.2.2.1 Interrogative 'what'
The most general term used for 'THING' is mande(hmoh) 'what', jmoh is a form
only used by the elderly and, according to speakers, is the equivalent of dmoh.
However, I was unable to establish any motivation in terms of the function of the
various forms. A specific form is used to seek information regarding identity in
terms of class membership: nmoh 'what class' (see below). The derived
interrogative j<nh>moh (WHAT<NMZ>) 'what say' <— jmoh 'what' is used to ask a
speaker to repeat something that the hearer has not heard properly:
(33)   j<nh>moh      nerj?
       what<NMZ> before
       What was that (you said) before?
i. mandehmoh 'what* mandehmoh and its variants exhibit a tendency to be used
when the referent is the subject of a non-verbal clause (34), or a subcategorised core
argument of the verb (35), including clausal objects.
(34)   The protagonists need boiled water and are forced to improvise:
       mandehmoh ga=jragan dak?
       what            lMM=kettle water
       What (is to be) the water kettle?
(35)   dmoh me=kD=rei)-i??
       what REL=2fA=seek-lTER
       What do you keep on seeking?
In (34) and (35) the referent of mandemoh and dmoh is an entitiy; in the following
clauses, the ignoratives have an event as the referent:

not the individual entity in question; roughly as English 'which'. In (38), the
superordinate class is identifiable by the speaker, but not the lower-order term. Note
that the form of nominal used is that which indicates individuation or a lower-order
member, affixed with the nominalising morpheme +n+ 'INDIV' (§7.6.1.1).","[207, 208]"
"  In the verbal clause, the aspectual clitic marks an event on the verge of obtaining.
Subtleties in meaning are achieved in combination with the aspectual properties of
the host verb. Take for instance the example in (251), where the morpheme is
proclitic to a transitive verb. The speaker contextualised the example thus: the
protagonist has everything ready and is about to leave the house in order to go
planting.

"9.2.3 Fronting: the clause-initial position
The pre-verbal position in the transitive perfective clause functions as the focus
position. The function of fronting is to establish a known entity as topical in the text.
In subsequent clauses the NP has zero representation, other than A which is
cross-referenced on the verb. The fronted NP may be any core or non-core NP; most
frequently the position is occupied by the O. Note that the process of fronting is not
accompanied by a change in verbal morphology, and as stated above, the A is still
cross-referenced on the verb. Hence, fronting does not represent a process of
syntactic promotion, but rather is a pragmatic strategy.
                                                                       9.2 Constituent order   257  Core NPs are constrained by the following factors:a) The pre-verbal position can contain at most one core NP, (a constraint which
does not hold for the post-verbal position). In (57) the A is fronted, see (21) for an

7.1 The internal structure of the noun phrase
The nominal forms the head of the noun phrase. Nominals may be modified within
the NP by a quantifier which occurs pre-nominally, or by a demonstrative, an
attributive or an associative which occurs post-nominally. The following diagram
represents the unmarked or preferred order of constituents in the NP.

Some examples illustrating the possibilities set out in Figure 7.1 are provided below.
  The quantifier, often realised as a phrasal constituent, can be a numeral (1), or a
numeral and either a classifier (2) or a measure noun (3). Quantifier phrases usually
precede the head, but they can also follow it. The classifier phrase is frequently
found post-nominally (3) and the ramifications of this are discussed in §7.3.2.

1.1 Linguistic type
Semelai exhibits many of the typological characteristics of a mainland Southeast Asian
language, as well as incorporating aspects of Austronesian, notably from sustained
contact with Malay. Whilst there has been considerable impact from Malay,
particularly at the lexical level, Semelai remains a distinctly mainland Austroasiatic
language, but at the same time raises questions with respect to our understanding of
the typology of this region.
A. Phonology Semelai has a rich phonemic inventory. There are thirty-two
consonant phonemes, including a series of voiceless nasals which have not been
recorded previously in an Aslian language; a series of glottalised sonorants, and
twenty vowel phonemes: ten oral vowels and ten phonemically nasal counterparts
(§2.1).
   The maximal canonical syllable is [CV(C)]CT. Phonemic contrasts of both
consonants and vowels are richest in the final syllable; for consonants these contrasts
are maximised in the onset of the final syllable.
   Words have the structure: co —» (crR)n (a) 'a, where: n < 2. Reading from the right,
'a is the final syllable - word stress is always on the final syllable, and there is no
secondary stress, a is the penultimate syllable and aR is the prepenultimate syllable.
The r indicates significantly reduced phonotactic possibilities for both consonants and
vowels, including the characteristic underspecification of vowels associated with this
position. Any oral vowel phoneme has the potential to occur as the phonetic realisation
of an underspecified vowel in a given environment.
   The minimal word is monosyllabic, e.g. /t h i/ 'hand', the maximal word is
tetrasyllabic: /k .r .wan.cerj/ [keruwancerj] 'coral snake sp.'
B. Morphology Semelai is an isolating language with agglutinating features.
Typically for the Aslian family, but at variance with many Mon-Khmer languages,
Semelai has a complex morphological system, containing a rich inventory of prefixes,
1
  The Semoq Beri do not inhabit this area {pace Parkin 1991: 55), but an area in north eastern
Pahang.
2      / Semelaiinfixes, suffixes and a circumfix. Some have their origins firmly in Austroasiatic (e.g.
the nominalising affixes +n+ 2 and <m> (NMZ)), others have been acquired through
language contact with varieties of Malay (e.g. br- (MID) 'middle voice', and t r -
(HAPP) 'happenstance'), see §3.2. Semelai has distinctive word classes (see C below
and §4); the typical function of derivational morphology is to change the word class or
subclass of the root, e.g. from verb to noun or vice versa, from transitive verb to
intransitive verb (§5.3) or mass noun to count noun (§7.6).
   There are two systems of arrangement based on the domain of attachment: a) a non-
concatenative system of prefixes and infixes, which has its origins in Mon-Khmer;
and b) a concatenative system of prefixes, suffixes and a circumfix acquired through
contact with Austronesian, notably Malay. Both systems of attachment are
prosodically driven.
   Affixes may be syllabic, or they may be non-syllabic consonantal units defined in
terms of syllable position, e.g. <r> 'CAUS' is a syllable coda infix r] CT . Syllabic
affixes are fully prespecified, e.g. [ p a r ] o 'CAUS(ative)'.
   Where affixes exhibit allomorphy, this is conditioned primarily by the syllabic
structure of the root and the domain of attachment: monosyllabic roots select heavy
syllable prefixes, whilst disyllabic roots select either infixes or light syllable prefixes,
dependent on the individual affix. These points are illustrated in the following
discussion which focuses on affixes from the non-concatenative system that take the
prosodic head as the domain of attachment.
   The two forms given above for the causative morpheme, t a r - 'MCAUS' and <r>
'CAUS', are licit for monosyllabic and disyllabic roots respectively:    a) Monosyllabic root: hop 'to put food in (one's) mouth'
       Affix t a r - 'MCAUS':
       tar-hop 'to put food in (s.o.'s) mouth'    b) Disyllabic root: jtek [jtek] 'to sleep'
       Infix <r>'CAUS':
       j<r>tek [jertek] 'to cause to sleep'   The most intriguing morphological process is the reduplicative process, which I
term 'Copy'. This is a form of internal reduplication, whereby a phonologically
underspecified morpheme template [CC]^ equivalent to the maximal canonical
syllable, is affixed in penultimate syllable position to the final syllable of the root. The
underspecified segment, which may be a syllable onset or a coda, derives its
phonemic content by copying that of the corresponding segment of the root. The
underspecified vowel slot is filled by epenthesis.
   With monosyllabic roots, the satisfaction of the prefixed template requires full
reduplication of the root:Monosyllabic root: SDC 'to whistle'
 a) Prefix the template [CC]^:
        [CC]JA-SDC2
  Morpheme boundaries of prefixes and suffixes are represented by a hyphen *-', infixes and the
circumfix by parentheses '< >', underspecified affixes are enclosed by '+' and clitic boundaries are
shown by '='.
                                                                1.1 Linguistic type   3  b)   Onset and coda copy reduplicate the phonemic consonantal content of the root
       into the underspecified positions in the prefix:
       9C-SDC  c)   Given that only consonants may be reduplicated, the underspecified nucleus
       receives phonetic contentfromthe application of vowel realisation rules:
       SC-SDC [sicsDc] 'to be whistling'  With disyllabic roots, the phonemic content of the penultimate syllable of the root is
associated with the template. Coda copy takes place into the underspecified coda
position:
Disyllabic root: caUk 'to detach'
  Coda copy:
  a) Prefix the template [C]^ to the prosodic head and associate the phonemic
       content of the root:  b)   Copy the phonemic content of the root coda into the underspecified coda
       position C:
       ca<k>Uk 'to be detaching'
  Coda copy may co-occur with the affixation of a partially prespecified affix like
nominalising onset n- which has a morphemic template [nC]^:
Monosyllabic root: soc 'to whistle'
 a) Prefix the template [nC]^ and associate the phonemic content of the root:
     [nCJfi-SDC ->nC-soc
 b) Coda copy reduplicates the phonemic consonantal content of the root into the
     underspecified position in the prefix:
       nc-soc
  c)   The underspecified nucleus receives phonetic content from the application of
       vowel realisation rules:
       nc-soc [nicsDc] 'act of whistling'
  Borrowed Malay lexemes are fully incorporated into the Semelai system. There are
no restrictions on the combinatorial possibilities of indigenous and borrowed terms.
  a)   Coda copy
       Prefixation of the template [CC]^ to the prosodic head of verbal root tujiuk 'to
       point out, indicate' (< Malay tunjuk) derives:
       tu<k>jiuk 'to be pointing'
  b)   Nominalisation:
       Infixation of the nominalisation template [nC]^ into the root sudu? 'spoon' (<
       Malay sudu) derives a measure noun:
       s<n>u<?>du? [sanu?du?] 'spoonful'
   Roots can feed multiple affixation, combining affixes from both systems of
attachment. In the following example, taking the verb kjiep 'to blink', the causative
infix, <r> 'CAUS', is a morpheme of the non-concatenative type, and the prefixed
happenstance morpheme, t- 'HAPP', is from the concatenative type:
4         1 Semelai     a)    Infixation of <r> 'CAUS':
           k<r>jiep (blink<CAUS>) [kerjiep] 'to make blink'     b)    Prefixation of t - 'HAPP':
           t-k<r>jiep (HAPP-blink<CAUS>) [Ukarjiep] 'to happen to make blink'C Word classes       Semelai has clearly distinguished word classes, both syntactically
and morphologically. The open classes are nominal, verb and expressive.
   The nominal superclass includes nouns, as well as the following closed classes:
numerals, pronouns, demonstratives and ignoratives. Nominals function as the heads
of NPs, predicates in non-verbal clauses and nominal modifiers in associative
constructions.
   Verbs function as predicates. The majority of verbs are clearly transitive or
intransitive; there is also a small number of ambitransitive verbs. The distinction
between stative and active verbs cuts across the transitive/intransitive division.
Intransitive verbs also distinguish an adjective class.
   Expressives 3 are iconic utterances, which function to simultaneously provide
information about both the predicate and its arguments, in the form of a single lexical
item. They function as clausal adjuncts, or stand alone as minor clauses.
   Members of this class express sensate imagery - aural, visual, oral, tactile - e.g.
torjboc 'short and fat (of people)'. Expressives frequently combine a cluster of
properties, e.g. the lexical item br?ol '(s.th.) large, dark and motionless lying
submerged in the water' combines dimension, colour and position. In addition, they
exhibit irregular phonology, irregular reduplication patterns and vowel alternation.
   The closed classes are preposition, adverb, auxiliary, existential and ascriptive
predicators, negator, connective and interjection (§4).
   Lexemes must undergo derivational procedures, either morphological or syntactic,
in order to function in a different word class.","[29, 30, 31, 32]"
"  In (40) the ignorative is in second position, apparently motivated by the
preference for ordering old information before new. ?aseq 'to be unusual' or
'outside the norm', is used here in a classificatory sense in conjunction with sma?
'person' comparable to the construction sma? putih (person be.white) 'European',
and not as a property. This point can be clarified by referring to (47) in §6.2.3.1.",[208]

  This is in fact a widespread problem in Austronesian, which has received a range of treatments - see
Broschart (1997) for Tongan, Schachter (1985) for Tagalog, and Gil (1994) for Riau Indonesian. The
same problem has also been claimed in Austroasiatic, for instance Hoffmann (1903) for Munda and
more recently for Khmer (Schiller 1992). However, for a reanalysis of the Munda problem, see Evans
(2000), and for word classes in Korku, see Nagaraja (1999: 30). The situation in Semelai corresponds
well with the description of word classes in the Central Aslian language Semai (which Diffloth notes
with surprise given the situation in other Austroasiatic languages, and Austronesian), where
morphological and syntactic criteria clearly define the two classes of noun and verb, with only minor
evidence of overlap (Diffloth 1976a: 249-51).
96        4 Word classes     c)    It may constitute a subclass of an open class (see point c) above).
     d)    Members of the closed class may be either free lexemes or bound lexemes.
     e)    Closed classes tend to exhibit distinctive and paradigmatically organised
           patterns of semantic opposition, e.g. the categories of person, number and
           deference in the pronominal system (§6.1.1), the spatial parameter of
           proximate and distal in demonstratives (§6.3.1), the antonymic oppositions in
           the adjectives of dimension (§5.2.1), and the spatial distinctions in the deictic
           locative and directional prepositions (§§8.4-8.6).
   In the analysis given here, the word classes are distinguished by structural or
formal properties, in terms of the relations they form with other categories.
Essentially, membership in classes is unique, although there are some areas where a
lexical item may exhibit features of two classes, suggesting an overlap. This
apparent overlap, where certain items appear to exhibit membership of a different
class is treated as a case of heterosemy, e.g. locative nominals which may enter into
a construction which is equivalent to a locative preposition (§7.5.3).
   Membership of a class does not automatically attribute the same status to all
members of that class (Croft 1990: 190). At the core are the prototypical members
which display all attributes; less prototypical members which may display only a
subset of the characteristics of the class or exhibit their own unique features, and
members which sit on the boundary, exhibiting features of intersecting classes, e.g.
deverbal nouns, where the derivative does not enjoy the same membership as
prototypical members of the class. This point is taken up in §4.2.1.
   Derivational morphology creates the means of transfer from one class to another,
e.g. nominal to verbal and vice versa, but for the most part, movement between
classes is unidirectional. Derivational morphology is at its most productive for verb
to verb derivations, more constrained for verb to noun derivations, restricted for
noun to noun derivation and highly restricted for noun to verb derivation.
   Intraclass derivations can be characterised as imparting information about a
specific facet of an event or entity, e.g. verbal morphology imparts information
about aspect or changes in valence structure; nominal morphology derives nouns
which refer to a subset of referents of a generic noun. It should be pointed out that
where affixes share the same phonological form, e.g. deverbal nominalising +n+
'NMZ' and the nominal unit deriving affix +n+ 'UNIT' (§3.2.4), they are considered
as a case of affixal homophony and it does not suggest a case of convergence
between lexical categories.
   Derivation is semantically driven, and often idiosyncratic, hence it is not reliable
as the sole means of establishing distinctions either between or within particular
classes. If anything, derivation suggests the necessity of defining specific semantic
field categories. For example, the application of verb-deriving morphology to
nominals is restricted to classes of words which have body parts, clothes,
instruments/implements, kin or rituals as their referents, deriving verbs with the
meaning 'to have/use/provide with N \ e.g. tpurj 'flour' —> t<rp>purj 'to perform the
tpui) tawar ""flour"" healing ritual'.
   The following discussion of the various word classes is divided into two main
sections, the first deals with open classes (§4.2), including the superordinate
category of nominal (§4.2.1), and the second section deals with the numerous closed
classes (§4.3). Nouns are distinguished on the basis of syntactic rather than
                                                                 4.2 Open classes   97
morphological criteria, whereas verbs also invoke morphological criteria, although
this functions to set up various minor classes rather than provide conclusive
evidence of a class of verb.
  Two specific exceptions to the general complementary distribution of noun and
verb are the ability of restrictive adverbs to modify both verbs and nouns in terms of
scope, ca ?en (eat just) 'just eat', dak ?en (water just) 'plain water' (§10.3.1); and
the ability of both nominal and verbal phrases to be marked with la= 'A; BCS' with
similar semantic consequences (§11.5).
  Two categories, expressive (§4.2.3) and interjection (§4.3.7), function
independently without syntactic connection to another clause, but maintain a
pragmatic connection within the discourse context. The discourse function of
connectives (§4.3.6) also shares this feature.","[123, 124, 125]"
"Referring back to example (143) above, this reading is understandable if the verbal
action is characterised as 'remove the inedible outer layer of the fruit in order to
consume it'. The woman peels a betel nut and a mango, both requiring different
methods of peeling and different implements, clippers for the former and a knife for
the latter.
III. w$r 'instead, rather' The simplest translation of war is 'instead' or 'rather'.
It is used for the repetition of a verbal action where an element is replaced - either
an argument, or a verbal component. The replayed action is not simultaneous with
the original action of the other person, but usually follows it. Often the desire of the
second person to replay the event is based on a desire to emulate the other person,
thus it is translated as 'X wants to V in Y's stead', war may be pre- or
post-predicate. The correlation between position of the constituent and its scope in
the clause is unclear, although the lexeme generally appears to directly follow the
constituent it modifies.
   In (147) war carries the meaning mentioned above, 'X wants to V in Y's stead'.

"  Semantically, each clause in this construction is an independent proposition. The
concatenated construction can convey the following range of semantic propositions:    •   consecutive (§11.4.1.1)
    •   purposive (§11.4.1.2)
    •   conditional (§11.4.1.3)
    •   simultaneous (§11.4.1.4)The independent clauses are simply juxtaposed in a fortuitous manner, and there is
no overt marking of the semantic relationship holding between the clauses. In the
absence of any overt markers of the relationship between the clauses, they are
ordered in relation to the logical sequence of events, i.e. chronologically - e.g. in the
conditional the antecedent must precede the consequent - and are not
interchangeable under any circumstances.
   Understanding these clauses depends on pragmatic interpretation based on
knowledge of the discourse context, or specific cultural knowledge (§11.4.1).

  The presence of Mon-Khmer numerals above three is a feature peculiar to the Southern Aslian
languages (Blagden 1906, Diffloth 1976d, Kruspe fieldnotes). Williams-Hunt (1952: 27) recorded
Semelai numerals for eight, nine and ten: kitwit 'eight', kantim 4nine' and kumai 'ten'; these forms
are no longer attested.

        They gave one hundred (ringgit).
There are constraints on the usage of the two systems. To name the months the
Malay numerals are used: bulan tiga? (month three) 'March', bulan tujuh (month
seven) 'July'. To enumerate months the indigenous system is used for the numbers
1-7, e.g. pru? bulan 'six months'. Likewise with time 'five o'clock' is Malay pukul
lima? (hour five), but 'five hours' is msDrj jam.2
   The use of ordinal numerals is exceedingly infrequent. The formation of ordinal
numerals follows the Malay system. They are formed either by using the word
namba? 'number' «— Malay nombor, followed by a Malay cardinal numeral,
namba? tiga? (number three) 'third'; or the use of the Malay prefix ke- /Jte-/
followed by a Malay cardinal numeral, k-tiga? 'third'.
   Semelai numerals have a reduplicated form that is used to express 'a group of X
number of people', e.g. srj-s:>rj 'a group of five people' <— msoq 'five' (§5.4.1.2).
This form functions as an alternative to the classifier ?ikur for people (§7.3.2).
   To express a sole participant the phrase consisting of a pronominal proclitic and
ba?i 'to be alone' is used, see (7) above.
   Numerals may also be prefixed with kn- 'ENM' in order to enumerate: kn-dwa?
<— dwa? 'two'. The numerals three and four prefix an allomorph kna-, e.g. kna-
mpe? 'three'.
   Some speakers only use these forms with inanimate entities; other use them for
people, but only up to five, after which it is considered impolite.

classification of 1976. The Southern languages in particular had remained somewhat
of an unknown entity up until this time. Williams-Hunt (1952: 23) had proposed a
new classification, however, like so many other researchers he complicated facts by
failing to understand that 'racial', cultural and linguistic criteria were not concordant.
Classification of the 'Sakai' languages was plagued with inconsistency, partly due to
this persistent oversight amongst investigators. Classification of the Semang group on7

 The Temoq are definitely misplaced in Schebesta's classification. They are in fact in the Southern
group, not members of a southern branch of the Northern group as suggested here.
14     1 Semelaithe other hand had always been relatively consistent, due no doubt to their distinct
appearance and the fact that 'racial' and linguistic criteria are aligned.
   Benjamin (1976a) preserves the Northern Semang group but finds evidence to class
Schmidt's Sakai languages into two groups: Central and Southern. His paper presents
a major advance in that the classification is based purely upon linguistic data.
Benjamin collated word lists of twenty Aslian languages and dialects9 of the Malay
Peninsula and carried out lexicostatistical and glottochronological surveys. The author
describes the resulting classification (see Figure 1.1) as '... a heuristic classification of
the Aslian languages ...' and suggests that future work may greatly alter the picture
(1976a: 66). While Benjamin's work is to be commended, the fact remains, as he
himself admitted, that it is largely based on a single word list for each language, and
the presumption that all Aslian languages developed from one proto-language.
   Unfortunately, to date no further work has been published in this area, other than
Diffloth's slightly modified version which, however, doesn't provide any supporting
argument (Diffloth and Zide 1992: 139).
   Little information is available regarding the relationships of the Southern languages,
other than what can be gleaned from available publications. The only linguistic
information is word lists of Temoq (Collings 1949a) and Besisi (Skeat 1896,
Wazir-Jahan 1981) and some preliminary remarks on Semoq Beri (Nik Safiah Karim
and Ton binti Ibrahim 1979). Although there are only four languages recognised in
this group (making it the smallest of the three) they represent a wide distribution,
extending from the northern state of Kelantan down through Terengganu and into
Pahang. In the west, the Besisi are the only coastal dwelling Aslian people, isolated
from all other Aslian communities.
   The Southern languages appear to have separated early, and developed into distinct
languages. Semelai and Temoq appear to be the closest, but all four languages exhibit
inter-language loan rates of less than 3 per cent and a low modal cognacy percentage
of 38 per cent (Benjamin 1976a: 73).","[41, 42]"
"933      A-marking and the intransitive clause
The previous section focussed on the prototypical coding of core NPs. A subset of
intransitive verbs may employ A-marking both on the NP and on the verb,
cross-referencing the single argument with the pronominal proclitic and marking the
post-verbal NP with la= 'A' - both features usually associated with transitive
predicates.
   The verbs which may mark S as A are human activity verbs such as jtek 'to
sleep', swak 'to go', paloh 4to flee', dos 'to arrive', wh-woh 'to awake', ?yam 'to
cry', and stative verbs expressing human emotion: c?en 'to be happy', risaw 'to be
sad', ?jiih 'to be ill', bth:>rj 'to be afraid', s?r:>? 'to miss (s.o.)', qren 'to be angry'.(113)    ki=c?en          la=bapa?     ?yot
         3A=be content BCS=father return
         She is happy because her father has returned.
This coding strategy is used when the action or state is caused by an external source,
but it is not itself a causative construction (§5.5.1.2) - the verb lacks causative
morphology, the clause is not transitive, and the NPcauser is not represented as an
argument of the verb, but rather as a causal adjunct (114).
(114)    ki=?yam la=ye
         3A=cry BCS=1
         He cried because of me.
  Example (115), like (114) above, illustrates clearly that the post-verbal NP is not
marking A, given that it is not co-referential with the proclitic on the verb. The post-
verbal NP is first person inclusive he '1&2', the proclitic is third person singular ki=
'3A':
