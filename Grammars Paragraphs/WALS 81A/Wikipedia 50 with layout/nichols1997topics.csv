"           This OSV order in (1 1a-b) is the unmarked order of arguments in such cases: that  is, neither argument has focus interpretation.                  In fact, focus movement restores SOV order
  in such clauses, (13a).           The same focus movement results in OSV word order in all other (i.e. basic SOV) clauses, for example (13b).

          All Zuni weak pronoun arguments move out of VP, regardless of case marking orgrammatical role, so that in addition to nominative subject pronouns                          and accusative
object pronouns as in (8a) and (lla) above, indirect object pronouns,                         (14a), subject
possessor pronouns,               (15a), and object possessor pronouns,           (16a), also undergo         this
movement.          Note that in (15a) and (16a) movement of the weak possessive pronoun outof VP results in a discontinuous possessive constituent, where the pOssessive pronoun has
moved to the left but the possessed noun has remained in situ.3232 In (16a) the particle hi§ occurs to the left of the fronted possessive pronoun fo'na:wan    in the usual
clause initial position for particles (see Section 1.3.4.2).",[55]

           In fact, Zuni     has multiple WH                  movement,       since all question      words   present
undergo movement,           (44a).    As (44b) indicates, the moved question words appear in thesame relative order as their argument structure positions, namely subject - indirect object- direct object.",[42]

               Although weak pronouns may occur as arguments of the verb, their syntax is    constrained by the requirement that weak pronouns undergo obligatory movement out of    the VP.         Basic word      order in Zuni is SOV,        as (6) illustrates with NP   arguments    that    undergo no special movement.30    (6)        waccita       wihac'ana       ‘utte-kya              dog         baby                bite-past              ‘The dog bit a baby.’          [* 'The baby bit a dog.']              (7a) illustrates the normal position of a weak pronominal object with respect to a lexical NP subject, while (7b) illustrates the unacceptability of a sentence containing aweak pronoun to the right of the NP subject and presumably inside the VP.
(7)a.         hom                  waccita     ‘utte-kya              Isg.acc.{[w]         dog         bite-past              ‘The dog bit me’b         *   waccita        hom               ‘utte-kya              dog            Isg.acc.[w]       bite-past              ‘The dog bit me.’              The position of negative elements in the Zuni clause can be used to demonstrate
that the weak pronoun in (7a) has moved out of the VP.                      Negation in Zuni involves the

           A different constraint governs the ordering of the clitic pronouns.                     The principles
 responsible for clitic order ignore the grammatical function of the clitic;                       clitic order is instead based on person features, so that clitic pronouns occur together in a clitic cluster in the order 3rd person - 2nd person - Ist person.82 Some possible clitic combinations are illustrated in (87a-c).        This ordering appears to reflect the operation of some type of person hierarchy constraint (see Jelinek 1993, Nash                       1995 among others for further
 discussion of similar phenomena).","[104, 105]"
"               The syntax of the two types of pronominal forms appears to be based on twodifferent principles.          When independent pronouns are used, their order is determined bygrammatical function.             Subject always precedes object, regardless of the position of theverb.8!",[104]
"             Event     headedness                is proposed           as    a way    of indicating     foregrounding           or backgrounding of the arguments of an event, so that in addition to being ordered asabove,       events     are        also     ordered           according       to relative    prominence.      In    particular,headedness allows the event structure to map to syntactic structure, which is constructedaround        a requirement               that        there    be    heads     of phrases.

95 The ordering of fronted WH words in Zuni is rigid and is assumed to be parallel in structure to multiple
WH constructions with similar ordering constraints in Serbo-Croation. Note from the order of WH
elements that while Zuni weak pronoun movement obeys superiority, weak WH word movement does not.
Adjunct WH words appear outside any WH argument words. I assume that Zuni argument WH words
move to the specifier of CP and adjunct WH words adjoin to CP.",[120]
"            The position of the negation particle in example (10) illustrates that in contrast, lexical NP arguments do not undergo movement out of VP.

 1.2 Data in this Thesis
         The Zuni data that appears in this thesis comes from two sources.         The bulk of the
Zuni in this thesis comes from my own field notes made during fieldwork conducted atZuni Pueblo during the summers of 1992 - 1996.             In addition, where relevant, data is
made use of from texts collected by Ruth Bunzel and published as Bunzel (1933).                The
Bunzel    texts, while quite a rich linguistic source in some ways,            are phonologically
unreliable.   The reader should therefore be aware that all of the data in this thesis fromBunzel    (1933)     has   been   retranscribed   and   is identified   each    time   it appears.
         I feel a great deal of responsibility in introducing the Zuni data contained hereinto theoretical discussion, particularly because there are so few other primary sourcematerials on Zuni.     As is always the case, despite having checked and rechecked the dataand judgments many times, one wishes one could have checked everything with nativespeakers still one more time.        I hope this dissertation may serve to generate furtherinterest in Zuni and add many more hands to the task of investigating the grammar of alanguage that has much to offer current generative theory and the study of cross-linguisticphenomena, much more beyond the topics illustrated by the chapters of this dissertation.
  1.3. Morphosyntactic Sketch of Zuni
            Because Zuni is largely unknown in the generative linguistic tradition, I will give
 in this section a brief descriptive outline of the more basic features of Zuni morphosyntax before going on to particular aspects of the syntax of Zuni in successive chapters.                            The
 reader should note, however, that this sketch is not intended to provide a complete grammatical description of Zuni but merely intended as an introduction to basic structural features of the language, particularly elements that will appear in examples throughout the dissertation       as well structural properties that will be relevant to the theoretical discussion in Chapters 2-4.4
 1.3.1 Basics of Morphology and Syntax
 1.3.1.1    Word Order
           In Zuni the verb occurs finally and strictly so; only an adverbial particle used toconvey perfect aspect (see example (40a) below) and parenthetical type adjuncts appearto be able to follow the verb.           Arguments occur in the order Subject - Indirect Object -
Direct Object, as illustrated in (1).5(l)a.      'a:w-okyaccik'         ‘a:-Siwi ‘a:w-an         ha'i__te-we'          wo-k'oSo-nap -kya

between     external argument             and structural case would                 therefore be only an indirectcorrelation, arising in only certain languages and resulting from unrelated constraints, e.g.on subjects, argument movement or chain formation.",[169]

"When      an NP moves         to the position occupied by [e] in (56c-d), the NP will receivenominative case.         The NP has no opportunity to receive accusative case even if it isassignable in these structures, because it must move out of the accusative position tosatisfy the Extended          Projection Principle condition            on subjects.        Marantz      therefore
hypothesizes       : “since     objects     may    freely    solve    the   subject     requirement       through
movement, it misleadingly appears as if objects are not licensed (assigned case) if there isno subject.”
           !44 145
144 Sigurdsson (1992) argues for a variation on Marantz's analysis, namely that NPs do not raise for case
reasons but rather because ‘it is impossible to keep two potential chains ‘chain distinct’ if their structural
relationship meet the general structural condition on chain formation and if they do not have any distinct
features. In other words, chains must combine or be visibly distinct, Structurally or featurally.’
145 The issues are not necessarily this simple. For example, some languages may allow either movement
or the insertion of an expletive subject (cf. Icelandic examples (21a) and (22) in Section 3.2.1.3), or
insertion of expletive subjects in a variety of constructions (transitives, unaccusatives, and/or unergatives
(e.g. (i) below for the last where it is not clear that satisfaction of the EPP is the driving force). In addition,
expletive constructions are restricted to unaccusative intransitives in some languages but yet in other
languages allowed in a variety of intransitive construction types. The issue is further complicated by the

how the inability of a verb to assign structural case can be reduced to the unaccusative D-structure
configuration.""
    In other words, even when (structural) case is available for NP2, the small clause construction is bad.
Héskuldur Thrdinsson suggests (p.c.), however, that the likelihood that a small clause predicate is
interpreted with an argument may be influenced by morphological case marking and thus vary cross-
linguistically. He cites the Icelandic example below in (i), in which there are three case (and gender)
marking possibilities on the adjective that give rise to one interpretation each.(i)            Haraldur      gaf     Helgu    s'upina          kaldur/kaldri/kalda

          This     puts case assignment in unaccusatives and passives in a new light.               If a
 language must resolve requirements of the EPP and does so by moving an object into subject position, we can also imagine             the case of a language     that does   not have      a requirement to satisfy the EPP, or at least need not do so via movement                   with overtphonological       material.    We   might   wonder     about   the case   assigning   properties    ofunaccusatives and passives in languages where EPP fulfillment is not required, or inparticular, not does not required fulfillment by movement of objects into subject position.","[172, 173]"

An expletive is also found in subject position of weather verbs, like felia    ‘be hot' (86b), and the adjective + CP construction (86d), certain existentials, (86e), and idioms, (86f), etc.2!2 The Southern Tiwa example shows the use of expletives

210       Information regarding the person, number, and case for up to three arguments is encoded in a
single agreement morpheme prefixed to the verbal complex. Information on the noun class of Absolutive
arguments is also included in this prefix. There are three primary noun classes distinguished by this verbal
agreement, traditionally referred to in the literature on Tiwa as A,B,C, or alternatively, as singular, inverse,
plural (Watkins 1995).     Every noun has a basic class designation, while its plural (or individuated)
designation belongs to another agreement class. Example (i) is from Picuris (Northern Tiwa) . Information
in the agreement prefix corresponding to different arguments is separated in the glosses by a slash.(i)      ti-                            ‘anam-                    kaw -

 1.3.2.4     The Structure of Noun Phrases
            Elements of the noun phrase occur in the order determiner/possessor - quantifier -N - adjective.      This is illustrated in (34a-c).(34)a.     lukkya   temta        ‘a:-c'ana           these     all         pl.-small(ones)           ""All these children'b.         hom                    temia            Cawe            lsg.acc.(poss.)        all             children           ‘All my children’b.         hot      ko:wi            teSokya_c’ana           indef.   little.bit       hollow           small           ‘in some little hollow'                                                                 [Bunzel 1933]
                                                          23
            In addition,      it seems       that no more        than one adjective can occur with a noun         - compare (35a) and (35b) - nor can adjectives be conjoined as nominal modifiers with the coordinating conjunction tap                 ‘and’, (36).      Since adjectives are stative predicates in Zuni and can take verbal morphology, cf. Silowa-‘kya                        red-past ‘it was red’, the only method
 of combining them involves the formative a separate clause headed by one of the stative predicates, to which the other stative predicated is subordinated with the subordinate suffix -n.        This is illustrated in (37).         This stative predicate clause then is used to referanaphorically to the noun in question by means of the anaphoric particle /e’ .

 specifier of a functional projection).               Foreshadowing       the analysis   in Section 2.2, I hypothesize that movement into such a deficient context blocks the presence of the weak pronoun because the pronoun is unable to locate licensing features in this context.49            To sum up, importantly for the proposals I will make in Section 2.2.3 concerning
 weak pronouns, (i) O'odham weak pronouns do not need to move in order to be licensed, and in addition, (ii) V appears to have some role in licensing O'odham weak pronouns.","[79, 80]"

"               The only type of agreement              on     the Zuni verb is plural number       agreement,
indicated for both subject and object arguments.                       (2a) illustrates the non-plural form ofthe verb.            Agreement for plural transitive object, (2b),          and most intransitive arguments,(2c), are both indicated by a prefix to the verb stem, while plural transitive subject, (2d),(and unergative intransitive subjects, (2e)) are indicated by a stem suffix, -(na)p ©                      (3)

"106 Te. we should not assume coordination is a non-deficient context simply because nominative case
assignment is never an option in other deficient contexts, like predication and non-finite emphatic

         I then proposed an account of pronoun structure and licensing that suggested thatpronouns consist of inflectional features that must be licensed by being situated in
proximity to some head bearing functional features.     I presented independent evidence forthe presence of these functional features in strong pronouns from the operation of theperson hierarchy constraint in Southern Paiute.
         Finally, I suggested that the ideas developed in order to account for strong andweak pronoun       syntax in Zuni and other languages can be extended to various otherphenomenon.       Specifically, I proposed that multiple WH    movement in Zuni as well as
default accusative case on pronouns in English might be given an account in terms oflicensing that captured significant generalizations in each case.   I also suggested that true
default case may not exist, and proposed a typology of language consisting of two types:that is, according to whether a language allows case-matching on bare pronouns             vs.
requires case assignment to be overridden on pronouns by licensing considerations.","[132, 133]"

              The distribution of Zuni WH             words is similar to that of the pronouns.            Strong WH
 words occur in syntactically deficient contexts such as single word questions, (106), and as predicates, (107).           The weak form of the WH               word cannot occur here.","[118, 119]"
