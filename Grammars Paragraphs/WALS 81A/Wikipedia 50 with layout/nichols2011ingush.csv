"For such examples it is difficult or impossible to know whether there is a null unspecified or
generic A or there is no A at all and the verb is ambitransitive. (See §21.2.7 and the footnote
there.) More research is needed on the question: if A's are freely omissible and most putative
transitive verbs are actually ambitransitive, then this is another profoundly ergative trait in the
lexicon and syntax of Ingush.

                                      WORD ORDER     Ingush is a consistently head-final language except for predominantly verb-second order
in main clauses. Verb-second order is much like that of Germanic languages in that the finite
verb is clause-second but its preverb, including prefixes, is clause-final. Nearly all phrases
and non-main clauses are head-final. In addition to verb-second order in main clauses there
are other, often pragmatically determined but always grammatically defined, word orders that
place elements in clause-initial or clause-final position or postpose modifiers of nouns. These
departures respond to such factors as chaining, interrogative words, topicalization, and focus.
Impressionistically, Ingush word-order changes are similar to those of Russian in some of
their pragmatic effects and in their frequency and variety, but they are unlike those of Russian
in the extent to which word order possibilities are are defined by syntactic boundaries.","[691, 692]"

the finite auxiliary of a verb in a compound tense) follows immediately after it. The
postverbal elements then follow in their usual order (subject, indirect object, direct object),
followed by the nonfinite part of a compound tense. The appearance of the verb in the
position after this nominal is unlike any other word-order process in Ingush in that it is just
the conjugated verb form – the finite auxiliary of a verb in a compound tense, or the shorn
stem of a prefixed verb – that is moved; the rest (the prefixes, the nonfinite part of an analytic

tense form) remains at the end of the sentence. Enclitics that can attach only to the verb,
however, stay with the conjugated form. A parenthetical word is discounted in figuring
second position.
    In the following examples the second-position finite verb form is boldface. (104)-(105)
have a simple verb following a one-word focal NP. Another example is (55 = 61) above.
Content questions (§30.3.1 above) are also examples of argument focus.","[709, 710]"

arguments is SV, AOV, AGTV (where G = the more goal-like argument and T = the more
theme-like argument of ditransitives: see §21.1). First elements of compound verbs and
heavy pieces of light verb constructions occupy the O or T slot. Examples showing this basic
order are (27)-(33) above and many others. This order is not rigid, and the arguments can
have different orders relative to each other and (in main clauses) to the verb.
     For non-arguments the preferred order is basically consistent with what is described for
adverbs by Cinque 1999 and Frey 2003. The order is not rigid, and it is not affected by
whether the non-argument is a single word, a phrase, or a converb clause. The major types
tend to occur in the following order, from clause-initial to immediate preverbal:
       Sentence adjuncts, e.g. evaluative ('fortunately'), attitudinal ('admittedly'), modal
('probably', 'perhaps'), are most often clause- or sentence-initial: (48), also (83)-(85) below.(48) … ghaalaazh jezh=m          xannaljga     suona xou, cwabaq'dy caar

degree adverb.(49)   handza=m ghaglhaazhkahw c'andanna dic             my     dannadii yz

       (inglingvo.ru/2010/04/21/g1alg1aj-kalendarax-laca.html, accessed Sept. 6, 2010)       Quasi-arguments (subcategorized goals and locations: §22.1) are positioned much like
objects, preceding the verb and following the subject, e.g. (31).
       Manner adverbs immediately precede the verb, following all arguments but preceding
any prefixes and proclitics, e.g. dika in (27).
    There are certain grammatical factors that change this ordering:
    Topicalization. Topics are usually clause-initial, e.g. (79)-(82) below and §33.3.2.
Possibly a special case of topicalization is examples that appear to be quantifier float, with the
quantifier in preverbal position and the topic clause-final.(51)   cy=t'y    wa=t'y-byllacha        jerriga wa=chy-jexar joaxar         legchaanka.

       D.all     3s.INS D.be.PRS now matter
       now it's entirely up to him ('with him') (0816)     Focus. A focused word or phrase follows a topic but precedes the rest of the clause
(§30.4, also (79)-(82) below).
     Extraction. One or another word, especially a possessor or an argument, is likely to be
sentence-final, perhaps for prosodic reasons: §30.5.
     A few morphemes that figure in the literature on adverbs and adjuncts have idiosyncratic
ordering in Ingush because they are clitics or preverbs. qy '(any) more' is a clitic, usually
clause-initial but occasionally initial in a smaller domain (see §5.6.1). Negation is a suffix on
finite verb forms and proclitic cy= on nonfinite forms; prohibition is a proclitic my=. 'Again'
is an incorporable adverb and therefore often found as a preverb (§15.5.3).","[699, 700, 701]"
"Objects regularly reflexivize the coreferential possessor of a subject. (33)-(34) show that
object control is not sensitive to word order. (Poss=O means possessor coreferential to O.)(33)     Shei        zhwalez bierazh qiera-dyr

"30.2.1. Verb-final order.       Verb-final order, usually AOV and SV, can be found in

       1s.DAT Ingush      language well know.NEG
       I don't know Ingush very well.",[696]
"30.2.3. Verb-second order. For main clauses, other than episode-initial and other all-new
ones, verb-second order is most common. The verb, or the finite part of a compound verb or
analytic tense form (i.e. the light verb or the auxiliary), follows the first word or phrase in the
clause.",[701]
"                                  26.2. Headed relatives     The relative clause is preposed to its antecedent (the head), its verb is a participle, and
there is no overt token of the relative noun in the relative clause. The participle agrees in case
with the antecedent, which is in the main clause and has its normal case and word order there.
There are almost no restrictions on relativization. Any case and nearly any syntactic role can
be relativized on, as long as the antecedent is identifiable. Only some alienable possessors
and some pure circumstantials – i.e. adjuncts whose inclusion is entirely up to the speaker and
not at all predictable from the clause structure or choice of verb – are generally not
relativizable. The following examples are cited in approximately decreasing order of cross-
linguistic accessibility of syntactic role, and include a range of the different cases or
postpositional forms that can fill that role.197 As in other examples, ___ marks the relative
gap and Ø is an anaphoric or unspecified pronoun (not a relative gap).",[612]
"Note the reflexive mirative in the song words (reflexive because the verb is imperative.) At
09:25 and 09:29 the verb-second word order, a simultaneous converb functioning as a
participle (xestavezh modifies nazam), the affix-final voicing in that converb, the pro-
nunciation of /y/, and the elided final schwas are as in today's language.",[777]

Not all speakers are able to distinguish or comment on these meaning differences. A Google
search for "" "" (dieza aaz, with ergative) and "" "" (dieza sy, with genitive) and
analogous constructions with other pronouns showed that they have similar frequencies, with
ergative slightly predominating.
    (74)-(75) are an elicited minimal pair for 'can, may'.166 Case attraction:167166
    The forms meg and mog differ in ablaut, i.e. in conjugation class. There is no other pair of
Ingush verbs that differs in only this way, so it is not a straightforward matter to say whether these
are inflectional variants of the same verb or different verbs. I assume their different valence
patterns suffice to make them different verbs. Kibrik 1981:36 (2003:624-625) shows that the Tsez
verb with meanings similar to meg takes either case attraction or case assignment. (The Ingush
and Tsez verbs are not cognate.)
167
     Other languages of the north Caucasus have a similar opposition of case attraction and case
assignment with modals and the like, and the literature (Forker 2010, Matasovi 2009, Kibrik
1981:36 [2003:624-625], Polinsky & Potsdam 2002, Haspelmath 1996:178-9, Harris 1995; Harris
& Campbell 1995:187-9 for progressive tenses) shows that (in languages where enough testing has
been done, chiefly Daghestanian languages) there is a syntactic difference between the two
constructions: the one with case attraction is monoclausal, so that a single surface predicate assigns
the case, while that with non-attraction is a biclausal construction with the finite auxiliary
assigning case to its subject and the subject of the infinitive non-overt because coreferential. Word
order and scope of modifiers establish the difference. In Ingush the situation is different. The
infinitive and modal verb (dieza, meg) are prosodically unified to form a single IP. Arguments or
other clause members generally cannot intervene between the infinitive and the modal. Negation,
adverbs, etc. can be understood to have scope over one or the other verb or over both, but this
cannot be overtly marked by changing the position of the adverb or negation (and in particular not
by putting it between the two verbs). Word order of arguments is more or less templatic (subject
precedes object, direct object precedes verb, interrogative word immediately precedes verb) and
does not serve to preserve constituency relations between verbs and arguments. All of this is
equally true regardless of the case of the subject. The examples below illustrate these various
points. (iii) and (v) (marked with minus signs) are stylistically less good but fully grammatical.(i) Aaz/sy     yz ieca         jieza

Ingush has no valence-changing processes. It has no passive. Ambitransitive verbs (§§21.2.7
and 21.3.1-2 above) give a valence choice comparable to active vs. passive in other
languages.
     There is no antipassive and almost no object removal even in verbs such as 'eat', 'cook',
'sew', 'read', which cross-linguistically are often used without objects as activity verbs.
Ingush uses a dummy object: often hama 'something', e.g. d.u' 'eat' (erg. A, nom. O) : hama
d.u' lit. 'eat something' (erg. A, dummy O hama 'thing, something') = 'eat, be eating, dine'.
Common in proverbs and the like is syskal ju' 'eat cornbread' (the traditional staple food).
d.iesh 'read' is lexicalized without an object in the sense 'study, be a student', but this is not
antipassive-like as it still takes an ergative subject as in (164-165).

      They didn’t go to school for long either, [because then] we were deported. (0409.22)Another example is (144) in Chapter 13.
    Nor are there other object-removing processes. Reflexives and reciprocals are separate
pronouns which occupy a valence place and do not detransitivize verbs or otherwise reduce
valence (see §29.3-4). There are almost no alternations involving objects, such as
applicatives, locative alternations, dative shift, etc.; see §21.2.8.5 for the few verbs that have
any variation in their object coding.
    Some auxiliary verbs change the case of a subject: d.ieza 'should' and similar modals
impose a subject case or take case attraction; the intransitive phase verb d.uola-lu 'begin'
imposes nominative case on the subject and the transitive d.uola-d.u imposes ergative case on
the A (see §21.6.3 above); the actual progressive auxiliaries are in origin intransitive verbs
and impose nominative on the A (while the generic progressive auxiliary 'be' allows either
nominative or ergative A) (see §13.4):(166) Aaz       gazet       desh
      1s.ERG newspaper D.read.PRS
      I read the newspaper. (generic present tense with ergative A)(167) So       gazet       dieshazh jy

      3s       newspaper read.CVsim PROG
      He's reading the newspaper (right now and visible). (progressive with nominative A)These various case options have no impact on the word order, control properties, etc. of the A
but affect the aspectual semantics (see §13.4).

     Thus the main valence-changing process of Ingush is causativization. There is very little
valence changing of any other type, and in particular no valence decreasing other than
ambitransitivity. On the other hand, the option of using a transitive verb without an overt A is
very commonly used, and though the A usually seems to be unspecified rather than truly
absent this construction does much of the work done by detransitivization in other languages.
(170)-(172) lack overt or identifiable agents and function much like their English passive
translations.","[519, 520, 521]"

    This word is not a nominalization, despite its similar morphology; it is the periphrastic
declension of the comparative adjective, which does not decline by itself and must take the
periphrastic endings in order to function attributively.

nominalization triggered by word order rules. It is a dialog between Tamerlane, on his
campaign through the north Caucasus steppe, and Cagen, the Ingush equivalent of Mullah
Nasreddin. In the first line, xala 'difficult' bears emphatic focus and is therefore fronted and
immediately preverbal; what is fronted is not just the adjective but also its head noun, as
unheaded adjectives are disfavored; the verb immediately follows (§§30.2.2-3); and the
stranded possessor must be nominalized. In the second line, the possessor has contrastive
focus ('our language isn't hard; maybe some others are') and is immediately followed by the
verb; 'difficult language' is old information; so 'our' is alone and must be nominalized.",[646]

"                                      29.6. Obviation     Obviation is the obligatory ranking of third person nominals (nouns, pronouns) based on
discourse function, syntactic relations, and semantic properties such as animacy. One
nominal in a clause is proximate (as are all its coreferents); the others (and their coreferents)
are obviative. Proximate outranks obviative for access to syntactic roles and processes.
Languages differ in whether and how they require that obviation ranking be aligned with
syntactic relations and animacy ranking. (This analysis of obviation, and the examples and
criteria below, are all due to Aissen 1997.)
       Since both possessors and subjects are proximate by definition, in languages with
obviation the following two kinds of configurations are problematic or impossible because
they make two different referents compete for proximate status. (In these schematic English
examples the asterisk means not that the English sentence is ungrammatical but that its
equivalent in a language with obviation would be ungrammatical.)
662                                   Ingush Grammar
       (a) possessor of subject is coreferential to object (bad because possessor is proximate,
therefore subject is obviative and object proximate, therefore obviation and grammatical
relations are misaligned): *Musai's wife is looking for himi; *Musai's friends scared himi. The
same configuration is acceptable where the coreferential nominals are not third person: your
wife is looking for you, etc.
       (b) main-clause subject (proximate) is coreferential to subordinate-clause object (which
is then outranked by an obviative subject in the subordinate clause): *Mariemi asked when
Musa had seen heri.
     When animacy is aligned with obviation, animates are proximate and inanimates
obviative. In such languages a third configuration is problematic or ungrammatical:
     (c) inanimate subject and animate object of transitive verb, e.g. *the snow covered the
sheep.
     Obviation has so far been attested only in head-marking languages (Aissen 1997:743),
where strictly grammatical constraints such as obviation are functionally valuable because
they can narrow down the assignment of reference and syntactic relations to formally
unmarked nominals. Something much like obviation is also evident in Ingush, a strongly
dependent-marking language, where it shows up as otherwise inexplicable gaps in formal
antecedence, i.e. in contexts like (a) above. Here are Ingush examples for contexts (a), (b),
and (c).
    (a) Third person possessors of subjects cannot formally antecede objects. Asterisked
examples here are ungrammatical where possessor and third person pronoun are coreferential
(but may be grammatical if they are non-coreferential).","[684, 685]"

"                         1.2. Typological overview of IngushIngush has a fairly large consonant system with three manners of articulation (voiced,
voiceless, ejective) and including uvulars and pharyngeals. Ejectives are not particularly
forceful and plain voiceless stops are not aspirated, so plain-ejective contrast is less audible
than in most languages of the Caucasus. Pharyngealization (phonetically, epiglottalization)
is a phonation property of syllables, audible mostly on the vowel but its distribution based
mostly on the onset consonant. There is a minimal tone system, and a distinctive descending
""sawtooth"" prosody that very demarcates phrases. The vowel system is large, with
diphthongization of most of the long vowels and much centralization of the short vowels.
There is an underlying long/short opposition which surfaces partly as length and partly as a
tense/lax opposition; there is a schwa, whose elision produces long vowels in open syllables
and thereby phonemicizes pure length at least for some speakers. Those speakers who can
hear schwas seem to perceive them as something other than vowels; still, in chanting, other
metric genres, and the speech of some of the oldest generations schwas are audible as vowels,
and those schwas that occur in what I call restressed position are full vowels (and heard as
such). This system of vowel-zero alternations, different sources of length, and schwas with
unusual phonetic status makes it almost impossible to devise a writing system that is
straightforwardly phonemic, a situation that makes it very difficult to achieve literacy given
the way Ingush is taught. Other aspects of the Ingush orthography make it very difficult to
sound out words or spell correctly based on pronunciation.
     Ingush is a mostly dependent-marking language. Nouns and pronouns distinguish eight
basic cases and some further secondary ones, whose endings are mostly monoexponential (i.e.
non-cumulative) and, in the plural, follow a separate plural suffix. There are four gender
agreement markers which distinguish, depending on how one counts them, up to eight
genders. Gender agreement is a partial category: only about 30% of the verb roots and 10%
of the adjective roots take gender agreement. Ingush also has overt inherent gender, where
the gender-bearing noun itself has a prefix marking its gender; this is also a partial category,
and is usually but not always the same as the agreement gender class of the noun.
     Verbs distinguish a very large number of tenses, which blend aspect and evidentiality
with pure tense. In addition to these there is stem-internal marking of plurality (of S/O)
and/or pluractionality, both partial categories. Apart from the tenses, Ingush distinguishes
various kinds of evidentiality and mirativity by other means such as suffixation and particles.
     The three word classes of noun, verb, and adjective are strictly differentiated
inflectionally, syntactically, and in terms of word formation, but they are not on equal footing
in the language. Ingush has a noun-based lexicon: elementary noun roots are an open class,
                           1. The Ingush language and its speakers                             11
while verb and adjective roots are closed classes (about 200 members each). The verbal
lexicon is split: the basic verbs (the closed class) have consistently ergative alignment in their
agreement and derivation, and take the full set of suffixal valence-affecting derivations; the
open class is phrasal predicates with light verbs, and they are mostly accusative in alignment
and limited in derivational possibilities (since most of the light verbs are transitive, while
several derivational categories are limited to intransitives). Basic verbs are mostly
intransitive and form semantic causatives by morphological transitivization; phrasal
predicates and compound verbs form causatives by transitivity-neutral processes such as
suppletion and change of light verb. Adjectives and manner adverbs are not formally distinct,
and neither are converbs and participles. On the other hand, attributive and non-attributive
adjectives, participals, and cardinal numerals are kept strictly distinct.
     The numerals are base-ten for the first two decades and base-twenty thereafter. They
form an unusually rich set of derivatives such as ordinals, distributives, nominalized forms,
plex forms, and others.
     Verbs form a large set of converbs: three basic ones (anterior, sequential, simultaneous)
used in chaining and a large set used in various kinds of adjunct subordination. There is
rather little finite subordination and almost no subordinating conjunctions; converb clauses
and nominalization are the main devices for complementation and adjunct subordination.
     Though verbs of perception generally have dative subjects and stative one-argument
phrasal verbs often have ergative subjects, making it possible to classify Ingush as split
intransitive, it is nonetheless consistently ergative overall, in the morphology of agreement,
case, and verbal derivation, and in syntax. There are almost no valence alternations (such as a
locative alternation). There are derivations that change valence or argument structure
(inceptive, causative) but no inflectional or syntactically-based passivization or the like.
     There is extensive and systematic long-distance reflexivization, accusative to neutral in
its alignment, subject- and object-controlled, and partly working to overcome the coreference
problems inherent in contexts of obviation.
     Phrases are head-final. Clause word order is like that of early Germanic: verb-final with
frequent verb-second order in main clauses (with prefixes and first elements of compound
verbs left in clause-final position). In most kinds of complex sentences the finite clause
follows the converb clauses. Where English would use clause or VP coordination with
conjunction reduction, Ingush uses chaining and therefore imposes a grammatically rigid
framework with argument sharing and strict choice of verb forms with sequence of tenses on
what would, in English, be a much freer matter of juxtaposing or coordinating sentences with
the same subject or topic. Relativization uses deletion, and unlike chaining and various forms
of nonfinite complementation, which have strict case and/or valence constraints on sharing,
there are almost no constraints on what can be relativized.
     Sentences are also mostly head-final, in that most chained and many subordinate clauses
precede the main clause. Controllers of coreference-constrained phenomena, and overt
tokens of shared arguments, are generally in the main clause. Controlled phenomena
themselves can and often do extend far to the left. Long-distance reflexivization and case-
12                                      Ingush Grammar
based argument sharing in core chaining, in particular, can extend over many clauses.
Logophoricity affects the immediately dominated clause. These and other factors that require
calculating from the end of the sentence while producing it from the beginning indicate that
fluent speech, especially narrative, requires a good deal of advance planning on the part of the
speaker. Even the phrase and clause prosody require parsing starting from the right edge of
the constituent. Though the Berkeley Ingush Corpus contains mostly the speech of the older,
fully fluent generations and most of my elicitation has been done with fully fluent speakers,
what information I have on the younger generations indicates that many of them are no longer
in full command of the grammatical phenomena requiring this extent of advance planning. If
this is indeed the case, and the younger generation cannot construct complex narrative in
Ingush, the language is becoming restricted in its ability to handle one of the essential
everyday functions.","[33, 34, 35]"

basic word order these immediately precede a local prefix or (if that is lacking) the inflected

"                                     21.5. Alignment     For the most part Ingush is morphologically ergative. Noun and pronoun inflection are
ergative except that the first person plural inclusive pronouns (plain and reflexive) and third
person singular reflexive pronoun are neutral (S=A=O, no nominative/ergative distinction).
Adjective inflection is ergative in the sense that it distinguishes nominative (S=O) from
oblique, which includes ergative. Verb agreement is morphologically ergative, triggered only
by nominative S or O. There is no morphologically accusative inflection in the language.
     Valence patterns of simple verbs are mostly though not exclusively ergative. The basic
intransitive (S), transitive (A, O), and ditransitive (A, T=O, G) patterns are ergative. The
verbs with dative experiencer subjects are mostly two-argument verbs, so they too are
ergative in that dative, like ergative, is an oblique case distinct from the S and O case. Unlike
true transitives, these verbs have a subject coded the same as an indirect object. Bringing
objects into the valence patterns yields the types shown in Table 21-4.
     For compound and phrasal verbs the picture is less neat. Many of them have as their first
element an etymological noun that functioned as O in the free syntactic phrase that was the
ancestor of the lexicalized verb:(61´) aaz       nab   jyr
      1s.ERG sleep(J) J.do .WP
      'I sleep'Synchronically these are one-argument verbs with S=A. They are numerous and productive
enough that Ingush could be called a split-intransitive or stative-active language overall, and
certainly the compound part of its verbal language has split subject marking.
     Agreement attraction, discussed in §21.6.2 below, is ergative in alignment, like all
agreement. Case attraction (§21.6.1) is accusative: the subject of the main verb takes the case
of a lower subject (S=A). The main suffixal verbal derivations, causatives and inceptive
(§21.7), are ergative in that they have a nominative pivot (the inceptive is (A=G) S=O;
causatives are A S=O). Control of reflexivization (Chapter 29) is accusative, except that in
contexts of obviation the controller is sometimes O (O=T=G) (see §29.3.1). Control of

infinitives is same-subject and accusative (S=A). Argument sharing in nuclear chaining
(§24.3) is ergative at least in conservative usage. Argument sharing in core chaining (§24.4)
is accusative, and the form of the converb in such constructions is ergative with a
nominative/oblique distinction like that of adjectives. Actual frequencies of core chaining
constructions in natural text, however, have an ergative and strongly case-limited bias, with
nominative (S=O) the most frequent controller and target and also less restricted in that S can
control nearly any case and role while A mostly controls A. Thus there is a good deal of
syntactic ergativity in Ingush.","[499, 500]"

    Though examples like (31)-(32) are not always accepted, there are unproblematic and well-
known compounds which, if they have been derived from syntactic phrases (as is of course not
guaranteed for compounds), must come from possessive relatives with body part nouns:
ka+mearsha 'generous' (lit. 'hand+free'), kuorta+muq'a 'independent' (lit. 'head+free'), dog+c'ena
'cordial' (lit. 'heart+clean'), kuorta+bweaxa 'long-haired' (lit. 'head+long'). A possessive like
[__GEN kuorta muq'a bola] sag 'person whose head is free' is a possible source, but a simple noun
phrase could not possibly have the word order Noun Adjective (*kuorta muq'a for 'free head').

participles of agreeing verbs are more or less lexicalized as adjectives:      d.änna 'dead'                     d.yzaa 'full'
      d.iexaa 'broken'                  d.äxaa 'drunk'Participles head relative clauses, and even when in reduced relatives they agree in gender not
with the head noun (the head of the relative clause) but with the S/O in their own valence.
(Of course, it often happens that the head of the relative clause is coreferential to the S/O of
the participle's valence.) (For relativization see Chapter 26.) In the following examples the
gap representing the relativized noun in the relative clause is indicated by an underscore. An
anaphoric or unspecified zero is marked by Ø. (Underscores and zeroes are placed where full
words would be in basic word order: see Chapter 30.) In (2), diesha agrees not with mexkarii

456                                      Ingush Grammar

nominal predicate, often an interrogative word (fy 'what', mala 'who'). Word order in the

"                                       24.3. Nuclear chaining     Nuclear chaining 181 is the closest kind of link between verbs. Ingush nuclear chains all
involve two verbs which are covalent, i.e. they share one or more arguments, as well as
sharing tense, mood, and aspect. With the examples below are shown the syntactic role(s) of
the shared arguments, in square brackets (shown in the order the clauses occur in).
(Constraints on the syntactic roles and cases of shared arguments are described in §29.1.3.) A
number of nuclear chains are more or less lexicalized, so that nuclear chaining is a productive
form of compounding.
     In the most frequent kind of nuclear chaining, a perfective converb describes a result
state or ingressive state that is semantically conflated with the finite verb, which need not be
perfective and often is not. Since the converb has no tense or aspect separate from that of the
main verb, rules of sequence of tense determine its form. When the finite verb is indicative
and not generic in time reference, the converb (the first verb) is in the anterior converb form.
(Here and below, bracketed abbreviations to the right show which argument is shared in the
two clauses.)(45)   hwal-ellaa          ull                                      [O S]

terms of Bickel 2010, Ingush nuclear chaining would be conjunct for all scope operators (even
aspect).

second one does not immediately precede it but precedes the whole chained pair. This is
typical for indirect and oblique objects but not for direct objects as shown in (56) immediately
below.
     Where the second verb is imperative the converb is in the sequential form:(56)   Vallie       tux hwa-daa                                                    [S A]
       go.CVseq     salt DX-D.bring.IMPV
       (Go) get me some salt. ('go' + 'bring' = 'get')(57)   K'alhwar-vealie dwa-ghuo,             vosha!                                [S S]

       Dx-V.go.CVseq       DX-go.IMPV said   3s.erg
       ""Hurry, leave!"" he said. (Dumézil 1936)The converb is also usually sequential where the finite verb is a narrative or generic present.
In (59), dwa'ettie is more or less lexicalized as an adverb meaning 'up and' and can be
separated from the other verb by the time adjunct cwan sahwataa 'in an hour'; bolx bea voal is
a complex single predicate consisting of a light verb construction in converbial form and a
phase verb. In (60) the two converbs share both A and O (ax jeaxie 'halving, severing' is
another light verb construction), and their nuclear chaining corresponds to the single English
phrase cut in half. 184(59)   Muusaa dwa-ettie           cwan        sahwataa             bolx bea voal.

       They shatter and cut in half the solemn bonds of kinship.                [A+O A+O]183
    In (58), the verbs are two different forms of the same verb (dwa-)d.axar 'go'. This is the only
verb with a suppletive irrealis converb, and it is used mostly in nuclear chaining as here.
184
    The first converb cicxazh dii (a light verb construction) 'shattering, making into smithereens' is
probably itself in nuclear chaining to the other two.
185
    The subject of 'finish work' is A if bolx bu 'work', lit. 'do work', is regarded as a transitive verb
plus object, but S if it is regarded as a light verb construction with ergative S. 'Finish' here is a
intransitive auxiliary which assigns case to the subject and agrees with it in gender.

    One of the most common functions of nuclear cosubordination in texts is to combine
manner and motion into a single complex motion predicate with a goal. No simple verb of
Ingush has both manner and motion meanings, and manner-of-motion verbs generally cannot
be combined with a goal phrase. Examples of chained motion verb constructions above are
(48), (51), and others; additional examples are:(61)   Shii       gouraa           t'y='a xeina,

have found all involve simultaneous converbs and describe durative or iterative actions going
on together. The first three examples here are lexicalized, and the others are potentially
lexicalized. These are normally written with a hyphen.       lielazh-hwuuzazh    'walking-turning around'; i.e. 'going around arranging things'

                                     24.4. Core chaining     In core chaining, the verbs share only one argument or sometimes two, but not the entire
valence; they share tense and mood but not aspect.186 The anterior, simultaneous, and irrealis
converb all figure in core chaining, the anterior converb being by far the most frequent in
narrative. Core chaining constructions generally have the chaining particle ='a enclitic to the
word preceding the converb (see Peterson 2001 and Conathan & Good 2000 for this particle).
That host word may be the verbal prefix, the first element of a compound verb, the direct
object, or (if there is no other host for the clitic particle) a reduplicated copy of the verb stem.
In (66), Muusaa is the shared argument, understood as subject of both verbs. Its nominative
case is assigned by the intransitive main verb aaravealar 'went out'. The transitive converb
danna 'gave; having given' has no overt subject (if it did, it would assign the ergative case to
it). As is more or less obligatory, the finite verb in the last clause is initial in its clause (which
amounts to verb-second order, where the chained converb clause constitutes the first
constituent) (see §30.2.3). Thus the two chained verbs are adjacent.","[554, 555, 556, 557, 558]"

      Sequential converb      -ieThere are also a good number of tense/aspect/mood auxiliaries, chiefly forms of the verbs 'be',
which are postposed to one or another suffixed form (most often a converb). The auxiliaries
take the full range of tense forms and may themselves be complex with further auxiliaries. It
seems that all possible combinations of base forms, auxiliaries, and tenses of auxiliaries
occur, and the meanings of the combinations are partly but not entirely predictable from the
sum of the parts. Here I have described only those that occur with sufficient frequency in the
Berkeley Ingush Corpus to support descriptions in standard terms.
     For practical purposes the tenses can be divided into suffixed ones and those formed with
auxiliaries. Some of the tense suffixes have distinctive morphophophonemics that point to an
origin in clitics, and some are etymologically identical to independent verb forms and must
once have been auxiliaries, but they are all suffixes at this point. The auxiliaries are written
as separate words in Ingush spelling, and they are separate syntactic words: they can be
moved by word-order rules, can stand alone as answers to questions, etc., and some of them
can determine the case of the subject, overriding the lexical verb's case assignment.","[266, 267]"
"     29.3.3. Logophoric reflexivization. Logophoric reflexivization, used in semi-direct
speech, is described in §25.10. An argument coreferential to the reported speaker is
reflexivized, even when a better controller intervenes (in the form of the subject of the main
clause of the reported speech); it is third person in form but – at least where the reported
speaker is overt – first person in meaning, and any anaphors it controls are first person.

                                      29.4. Reciprocals     Ingush uses two reciprocal words, both uninflected for case. vwaashii is evidently a
frozen nominative plural of a pronominal stem vwaash- (found in other frozen case forms as a
preverb: see §29.4.4 below). vaila/txeila/sheila is the adverbial form of the plural reflexive
                                                                              216
pronoun; it agrees in person with its antecedent but does not vary for case.      Kurkiev 2004
classifies vwaashii as an adverb and glosses sheila as Russ. mezhdu 'between' (surely a
                                                         217
typographical error) without giving it a part of speech.     The two forms are interchangeable
and can be used in any reciprocal context, regardless of the valence of the verb or the syntax,
case, animacy, or agentivity of the subject. Neither word seems to be controlled in any
grammatical sense. vwaashii seems not to fill an argument role but to simply be an
additional word in the clause. vaila/txeila/sheila (etc.) behaves as though it filled an
argument role (object or other nonsubject), but if so it is the only uninflected argument form
in Ingush; alternatively, it is a non-argument word which replaces an overt object. Neither
reciprocal is ever accompanied by any morphological form of detransitivization on the verb
or by a change of subject case from ergative to nominative. Neither has any impact on verbal
agreement or pluractionality. Both are interlinearlized noncommittally here as REC(iprocal).
     (98)-(99) are a minimal pair illustrating some of the differences between reflexives and
reciprocals. Both have the verb tar-lu 'get along' (nominative A, instrumental O). In (98) the
reflexive is long-distance, controlled by the main-clause subject. Its case is that required by
tar-lu. In (99) sheila behaves syntactically as though it were an object, but does not take the
verb's object case (it has no case at all). It is controlled by yzh 'they' in its own clause.
Reciprocals are never long-distance in Ingush.","[675, 676]"
