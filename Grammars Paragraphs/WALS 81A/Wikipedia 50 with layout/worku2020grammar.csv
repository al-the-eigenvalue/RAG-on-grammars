In (10.35a), it is the constituent word order that identifies the two arguments whichotherwise are almost identical and both arguments can equally share the same boundpronominal suffix which is cross-referenced on the verb. In (10.35b), it is thenominative case that identifies both arguments that come with strict ordering of thepost-verbal S/A argument.","[501, 502]"
"   Mursi is a nominative-accusative language and has a canonical constituent orderAVO (for a transitive clause) and/or SV (for an intransitive clause). Core-arguments inthis constituent order are functionally-unmarked. In addition to this, depending onclause types and pragmatic context, two other constituent orders are also utilized: anAOV order (in negated clauses) (as in (1.5b)), and an OVA in a transitive clause andVS in an intransitive clause where post-verbal subjects (S and A) are marked fornominative case (as in (1.6)).",[33]
"In AVO constituent order, whenever the subject occurs before the verb (pre-verbal),both the subject and the object that follows the verb are treated as an unmarkednominative and unmarked accusative case. By an unmarked case, we meanmorphologically and functionally unmarked, as shown below in (10.3a-d).",[480]
"   When first and second person pronouns are in O function in AVO order, as can beseen in the examples given below, bound pronominal O and A argument markers areattached to the verb. When both subject and object bound pronominal suffixes occur ina transitive clause, the object pronominal suffix always precedes the subject pronominalsuffix.",[481]
"   Grammatical relations in Mursi are marked by constituent order and case. However,case-marking is often employed depending on constituent order system of the language.",[41]

Note that interrogatives in Mursi take all types of case markers that nouns can take (seeChapter 12). However, rhetorical questions could trigger unusual constituent order inthe language. An instance of such is unusual constituent order is found in the rhetoricalquestion constructions in which the canonical AVO order become VAO. See theexamples given below.(10.9) a. wà           ár-ú                    [nɔ̀ŋ]A [nɔ̀ŋ?]O

In (10.9a), the recent past time particle wá appears at clause-initial position only inrhetorical type questions that require a confirmatory answer ‘yes/no’. This is a similarquestion construction to one used to make a question from a declarative copulaconstruction ― just by moving the copula verb into a clause initial position. In the end,the copula subject and copula complement tend to occur side by side, as in (10.9b).         b.    á                     [lɔ̀gɔ́]CS  [nɔ̀ŋ]CC?

With regard to indicating syntactic relation by bound pronominal cross referencing onthe verb, there are a number of exceptions to the generalization. The exceptions include:                                              460
A.   When independent pronouns are in S/A and O function, verbs are inflected for     person and number of the S/A and O arguments. In addition, verbs are inflected     for person of the S/A arguments ― this takes place in a k(V)- prefix for first person     unlike the second and third person S/A arguments.(10.10) (jɔ̀g)A    ɗág-áɲ-ɛ́                    (àɲè)O

As is shown in (1.5b), in an AOV order, due to strict orders of constituents, negatedverbs need to be moved to a clause final positions, and arguments in A/S function areoften forced to appear at clause-initial position. In (1.6a-b), the nominative case systemof Mursi operates based on an OVA/VS constituent order. Thus post-verbal subjects inthis constituent order are morphologically and formally marked by marked-nominativecase suffix -o, for a transitive post-verbal subject argument marker (A) (as in (1.6a-b)   Mursi marks both the head noun and the dependent form. There are morphologicalmarkers for the head noun and for the dependent (modifier) called ‘restrictive and non-restrictive modification’ form. As a head and dependent marking language, alldependents or modifiers, except number words and quantifiers are required to indicatetheir dependency relation with the head nouns they modify always by an overtmorphological inflection: -a (for restrictive) and -i [-ti] (for non-restrictive). Thisdependency phenomenon between head nouns and dependents is widely known as'Construct-Form' (CF) by some Semitists. In Semitic languages this phenomenon is alsoknown by a different term ― ‘construct state’. In fact, other terms are also used: ‘statusconstructus’ (Tucker and Bryan 1966), ‘modified noun form’ (Reh 1996), and‘construct form’ (Creissels 2006). In Mursi, both the head noun and the dependent canbe marked by the same dependency modification markers: HEAD.NOUN-a DEPENDENT                                           11

Chapter 10        Grammatical Relations
10.1   IntroductionGrammatical relations in Mursi are marked by constituent order and case. According to(König, 2006:657f.; Dixon 1994:63ff), Mursi is a multilayered language in that itutilizes a constituent order AVO/SV (neither the A nor the S arguments can beunmarked for nominative case) and the OVA/VS order in which post-verbal A and Sarguments are for marked-nominative case. However, case-marking is often employeddepending on the constituent order system of the language. Mursi is a nominative-accusative language. Although Mursi utilizes case-marking, it is also a head-markinglanguage that has cross-referencing bound pronominal forms to indicate grammaticalrelations. As a head-marking language, it has participant reference markings on the verbwhich predominantly indicate grammatical relations. This operates by indexing boundpronominal A and O argument affixes on the verb. In clauses with ditransitive verbs,argument indexing on the verb often operates according to referential prominence scalehierarchy and verb-adjacency constraint principles.","[475, 476]"
"   Nouns that take nominative case morphology may also occur independent of thestrict ordering of post-verbal S/A. In this case, they may occur in NPs that are topicalas well as focal within a clause, as in (10.36).(10.36) ìggè       [ŋà=éró=á          kòná-ù=ŋà]NP

        the damnation of hell?’
        (Lit. ‘You (pl.), the children of serpents, where will you (pl.) escape from the
        fire punishment?’
Both pronouns and nouns can occur at one position as topical plus focused constituents.(10.37) àggè      [kɛ̀nà-á      g=àw]NP             ká-ɓág-ó

Even non-animate nouns can behave like subjects as long as they are taking thenominative case. As can be shown in (10.38), hózò ‘hunger’ is the agent while the first
                                           479

         Aj!...’ (MH 4:30:6)10.2.3 The non-canonical order (AOV)The third and the strictest constituent order in the language is AOV. In an AOV order,due to strict orders of constituents, where negated verbs need to be moved to a clausefinal positions, arguments in A function are often forced to appear at clause-initialposition. Unless in few exceptional constructions, this applies to all negated verbsregardless of the type of clauses or moods in which they belong.(10.39) [àɲè]CS   k-án-í                          [támárí]CC

As shown in above negative declarative clauses, both A and O arguments precede theverbal predicate. Note that in the negative perfective aspect, the third person S/Aargument is marked on the verb as subjunctive marker in the same way as first person
                                          480
subjects, i.e. k(V)-. The second persons are marked differently from first and thirdperson subjects, so they do not make use of the k(V)- prefix (as in (10.41)).(10.41) ìggè   wà          ŋànì       dáʃí-ɗ-ó=ó          nɔ̀ŋ

        ‘You (pl.) have not done it.’
Furthermore, the position the O argument in AOV ordered clauses may vary when it isa pronoun and when it is a simple or common noun. When the O argument is a pronoun,it has been observed that there is a tendency for the O argument to follow the verbregardless of the aspect and transitivity (transitive and ditransitive) value of the verb.","[502, 503, 504]"
"   Typologically, negation constructions in Mursi show various striking features. InMursi, a number of different negation strategies may be employed to negate verbalconstituents. The strategies vary depending on grammatical systems or categories suchas aspect, mood, and person-subject. For instance, a verb in the imperfective aspect canbe negated by bound circumclitics whereas a verb in the perfective aspect is negated byindependent perfective negative particle ŋànì <NEG.PERV> ‘not, not yet, still’ plus bynegative enclitic =ó attached to the perfective verb root. Interestingly, negativedeclarative clauses have an obligatory SV/AOV, constituent order, for which negatedverbs always occupy clause-final positions. This is a syntactic phenomenon that worksonly for order of negated predicates in negative clauses, which is different from theaffirmative clauses in a canonical constituent order SV/AVO and from clauses havinga marked-nominative and case marked S/A subjects OVA (in a transitive clause) VS (inan intransitive clause). Many more interesting features of the negation system arediscussed in Chapter 13.",[42]
"   The other interesting point seems to be regarding the coding of core arguments onditransitive verbs, in which ditransitive verbs themselves divide into two types. Mursiditransitive verbs are: áʤ ‘give’ jóg ‘tell’ and ɗól ‘show, announce’. Despite the factthat languages employ different strategies for these verbs (cf. Dixon 1994: 120), all ofthem have three core roles in Mursi. The ditransitive áʤ ‘give’. ― (i) The bound objectpronominal form of the recipient (if human recipient) is cross-referenced on the verband the gift as peripheral argument without being coded by postposition or case markers(e.g. 10.19). (ii) The bound object pronominal form of the gift/theme (humanpatient/affected) is cross-referenced on the verb following differential object markingwhile the recipient is placed as peripheral argument coded by no overt postposition orcase marker (e.g. 10.20a-b). (iii) Only the subject in A function (the agent role) is cross-
                                            467
referenced on the verb while the gift is placed in O function and the recipient (if human)is placed as peripheral argument by suffixing a motion towards marker (dative) on theverb (e.g. 10.22a-b). The verb áʤ does not take a benefactive suffix like the other twoditransitive verbs. Moreover, it undergoes a three term root suppletion for aspect whilejóg and ɗól do not alter their roots for aspectual distinction. When two semantic rolesof the O arguments follow this verb, free ordering is possible as long as the recipient ishuman, as in (10.23a-b).(10.23) a. àɲè     k-áʤ-ɛ́                 hírí  mà

           1sg       1SU-give.IMPERV-APPL     water man
           ‘I give the man water.’
Both R and T can be cross-referenced on the verb when they are pronominal.
The same free ordering applies in the imperative construction, as in (10.23c).
      c. áín-ɛ́               bíró      ʃúúnú!

         ‘Give (sg.) the money to your father!’
 On the other hand, the ditransitive verbs jog (with core roles ‘message’ and‘addressee’) and ɗol (with core roles ‘thing-shown’ and ‘person-to-whom-it-is-shown’)take both motion towards and benefactive suffixes to encode either or both Oarguments.(10.24) a. ìɲè jóg-óɲ-í                        àɲè-jè

Whenever the addresses (R-role) is known, the message (T/P-role) may not benecessarily expressed overtly (especially if it is expressed in an earlier stage of thestory/narration), as in (10.24e-f).         e. lɔ̀g-á       [Ø kó-jóg-ó-úŋ-ù]RC

With respect to the stability of mono-transitive and ditransitive clauses in the canonicalconstituent order AVO, both appear to have a rather clear boundary and remain stablewhen combined with other type of clauses such as subjunctive/purpose/adjunct, relativeand subordinate clauses. Some examples are given below.

Cross-linguistically,marked-nominative is a rare case system mainly found in African languages. König(2008: 138) reported that marked-nominative case system are an almost unique African                                              469
phenomenon, which is only attested in few languages outside Africa. A commonlyknown scenario in a marked-nominative system is to treat/mark S and A the same wayand treating the O differently. Whatsoever is the constituent order it occurs in, the O isin no way morphologically marked. The O always has the same form (citation/basicform). Straighwardly, the marked-nominative case system of Mursi operates based onan OVA/VS constituent order.

10.2.2.1 Nominative case marking on pronounsMursi personal pronouns exist in two forms: (i) in neutral forms when occuring as pre-verbal subject and post-verbal object, and (ii) in nominative forms when occurring aspost-verbal subjects. In the non-canonical constituent order VS/OVA, the verb agreesin number with the post-verbal nominative form pronouns. The first person pluralnominative form pronouns do not distinguish inclusive and exclusive subjects. Eventhough nominative form pronouns have similar positions within clauses with nouns inmarked-nominative case, one basic difference can be noticed between the two. See thetwo examples given below.(10.28) a. kí-ʃíl-Ø                    jɔ̀kì=jè          tùn-ɔ̀

"AVO/SV is by far the most frequently found constituent order in Mursi clauses utteredin isolation.

"10.2 Constituent orderMursi has three types of constituent order: canonical AVO/SV, non-canonical OVA/VSwhere the A/S is marked with morphological marked-nominative case suffixes, andnon-canonical OAV (a somewhat a strict constituent order of negation). With respectto grammatical relations, each is dealt with in subsequent sub-sections below.",[478]
"However, pragmatically, S/A referring independent pronouns in the SV/AVO order areoften topical constituents while in the VS/OVA order they can be seen as focusedconstituents. Indeed, this requires further investigation.",[499]
"2.7.2 A grammatical wordA grammatical word may contain a number of grammatical elements, mainly three arecrucial: (i) they always occur together (cohesiveness), (ii) they occur in a fixed order,and (iii) they have a conventionalized coherence and meaning (Dixon and Aikhenvald2003: 19). Even though few exceptional conditions exist, almost all grammatical words
                                           107
of Mursi can be governed by these three criteria. Thus, a grammatical word in Mursimust consist of a root (nominal or verbal) and a minimum of one morpheme. Agrammatical word therefore can consist of from two up to seven grammatical elements(morphemes) that occur together. See the examples given below:(2.82)   a. ɓág-Ø
            eat.IMPERV-3sg.SU.IMPERV
            ‘S/he eats.’

            ‘We (inc.) will not tell (it) to you (pl).’
In (2.82a), we see a minimal verbal word consisting of a root (the citation form) markedby a zero morpheme third person singular subject marker on the imperfective aspect. In(2.82b) is a maximal nominal word consisting of four grammatical elements ― a suffixand three clitics. A minimal nominal word can be extracted out of (2.82b), i.e. múɲíɲ-í‘star (sg.)’. Of these, the demonstrative system shown by the circumclitics(ŋà=…=tùnù), is a good indication of grammatical elements cohesiveness in agrammatical word. The order of these grammatical elements in no way changes. In(2.82c), we find a typical example that shows the morphological nature of a word inMursi, i.e. agglutinating and predominantly suffixing. Like the circumclitics indicatingthe demonstrative system on nominals (2.82b), negation on verbs is mainly indicatedby circumclitics (ŋà=…=ó). Both the circumclitics could then be taken as a perfectproof that grammatical elements occur in a fixed order. As shown clearly, all thegrammatical words in (2.82a-c) have a conventionalized coherence and full-fledgedmeaning.","[130, 131]"

                                                  477
      end in this vowel. The case of -ɛ reduction from the animate noun mɛ̀dɛ̀rɛ̀ may be      taken as an exceptional case, if this is the only instance, but we can't be sure at      this stage. See the examples given below:(10.34) a. [lúsì]O ɗág-Ø                  [hírí-ó]A

"The verb in a relative clause modifier usually consists of full verbal inflections, and aconstruct form suffix for a restrictive and sometimes for a nominalizing function.

In (10.6a), only the perfective bound pronominal suffix -a for the third person Aargument is cross-referenced on the verb while no bound pronominal marking for thethird person O argument is cross-referenced on the verb. Since there is nomorphologically bound pronominal marking for the third arguments in O function, theconstituent order we see in (10.6b) could be unusual with respect to O slots in negatedclauses. Mursi has the non-canonical AOV/SV constituent order for negative clauses,as it is shown in (10.7).(10.7) [nɔ̀ŋ]A   [sátí]O  ŋà=hín-Ø=ó

But, due to the absence of a bound pronominal O argument marking morphologicalform on the verb, the negative clause in (10.6b) has no option but to behave the sameway as a clause in the AVO constituent order.","[481, 482]"
"(The details await us in Chapter 7.)   Adjectives are one of the three open word classes of Mursi. Adjectives are openclasses by derivation. Based on the morphological properties they display, Mursiadjectives can be divided into two major categories: underived (tííní ‘small’ and bùì‘big’) and derived (Type I― mainly from stative verbs; Type II ― derived from stative
                                            16
verbs and from other word classes through productive and unproductive morphologicalderivations). The two underived adjectives display sound iconicity. This phenomenonis an association between sound and meaning. Dixon (2010:69) pointed out that a highfront vowel i is often naturally associated with a little/small object and a high backvowel u with a big/large one. Adjectives always bear the general adjectiviser suffix -i,regardless of each adjective's morphological property. Syntactically, adjectives canmodify the head of an NP, fill the head of an intransitive predicate slot (as in (1.26)),fill copula complement slots, denote degree of the compared quality in comparativeconstructions, and function as manner modifiers. The adjective class of Mursi coversall semantic types that can be conveyed by adjectives.(1.26) [nɔ̀ŋ]S    [ŋà=íɗíbèn-Ø=nó]INTR.PRED

   Reduplication is the only way of marking number on underived adjectives (as in(1.27 and 1.28)). Only the underived adjective can take degree of magnitude markers:free form gòɗé (gèɗé) (diminutive ‘very small’) and the suffix -sís (augmentative ‘verybig’).(1.27) [ùrgùsá-í      tííti]NP

As Mursi is a free-constituent order language, the order among adjectives within NPsand in sentences is relatively free. As to the ordering of adjectives within NPs,throughout the adjective chapter and this grammar, no more than two adjectivalmodifiers are available. The details of adjectives are the topic of Chapter 8.","[39, 40]"
"   In this chapter, among many, are two major topics which have been discussed indetail, each of them are typologically rare and could perhaps be typical features ofMursi. These are Noun Modification Construction and marked-nominative case. Thenoun modification construction system of Mursi is the bearer of genitive case, whereasthe locus of marked-nominative case and other grammatical cases that mark both coreand non-core constituents is in the canonical and non-canonical constituent orders. Thus

   For example, free pronouns in the S or A function of the canonical constituent orderSV/AVO will in no way be marked for case, nor will it trigger any morphologicalmarkings which may indicate the relation of constituents in a clause, whereas in a non-canonical OVA/VS constituent order, pronouns in S/A are marked for nominative case,thus now encode further pragmatic function, i.e. focus/topic. For example, in a copularclause, the first person plural pronoun in CS function precedes the copula verb, as isalways the case in the canonical order ―àggè kánó ‘We (exc.) are’. Or to turn this intoa question clause, the copula verb should be moved to a clause initial position, i.e. kánóàggè? ‘Are we?’.

In addition to what we saw in simple mono-transitive clauses illustrated above, thecanonical constituent order AVO may have also various syntactic manifestations indouble object or ditransitive clause constructions and in other types of clauses. In orderto explain how syntactic relations of the direct and indirect object of a double object orditransitive clause constructions be recognized, there are certain key points to be takeninto account. For instance, in a double object construction, the indirect object orsecondary object may be placed at the first post-verbal slot and will have a semanticrole of recipient/beneficiary, or it can be moved to a clause-final position in the samesemantic role. This can be shown in two ways― (i) when the benefactive applicativesuffix -ɛ̀sɛ̀n is attached to the verb in its primary function (benefactive), and (ii) whenit is attached to the verb in its secondary function (dative).","[485, 486]"

Chapter 7 The verb and predicate structure
7.1    IntroductionThe verb is the second largest open word class in Mursi. The verb is a primary wordwhich functions as head of a predicate. Adjectives that function as heads of intransitivepredicates are those that are derived from stative verbs. This chapter offers an overviewof the phonological properties of the verb roots, and component grammatical elementsassociated with the inflectional categories of the verb such as subject and objectagreement, aspect, and mood. Verbs and their component grammatical elementsconstitute one of the most complex parts of Mursi morphology. Some verb roots canundergo up to four time morphological alternations to indicate aspect. Others undergoup to two or more than two-term verb root alternations in order to indicate grammaticalnumber and aspect.","[314, 315]"
"    The agentless passive construction in Mursi and Chai (Southeast Surmic group language) is the same. Therefore, it is appropriate to cite here one major claim made by two linguists who studied the Chai language. The following quote is about the agentless passive construction type in Chai:        ‘The logical object, which becomes the grammatical subject in passive
        constructions in other languages, remains the grammatical object in Chai, as
        the object agreement suffixes are similar to the object suffixes used in active
        forms. The verb agrees with the agent in number and person. The agent
        normally is not explicitly specified elsewhere in the sentence’ (Last and
        Lucassen 1998: 387).",[449]
"Another relevant deduction that can be made for sure from the discussions we saw inthe aforementioned sections is that the syntactic position of independent pronouns inboth AVO and OVA constituent orders can also be viewed from a pragmatically drivenpoint of view. In most cases, as long as the bound pronominal S, A and O argumentmarkers are cross-referenced on the verb, independent pronouns can be optional.",[499]

             this.’)
In (7.101), the continuative marker has both clauses as its scope. It refers a continuedhabitual past action that also covers the present and future habitual actions./ríb/ ‘all the day’The particle ríb may be used as frequency as well as habitual marker. It always occursclause-finally ― either often preceded by the specific time span word kàlì ‘day’(7.102a-c) or rarely followed by a temporal shifter bàrì ‘yesterday’ (7.102d).(7.102) a. hàlì    sán-í                kátámá-í-jè?  ɪmm ɪmm!

            ‘Will you (m) spend the day at the market? No, I shall stay all day at
            home.’
As it is shown in (7.102a), frequency/habitual marker ríb always occurs in a typicaladverbial position in AVO order. In contrast, future time marker hàlì always occursclause-initially if the clause in which it occurs is subordinate, otherwise often occursimmediately after the subject AVO order (as it is illustrated in (7.102a-d; 7.102a).         b. ìggè  bàrì      rúm-íɲá  čúr-ó                   kàlì ríb

           ‘He was writing (letters) all day.
The fact is that antipassive and progressive are marked in the same way by thederivational suffix -nɛ̀n. But as it shown in (7.102c) above, it is a typical antipassiveconstruction where the object of the clause is demoted. But, a progressive meaning canbe rendered by adding a temporal shifter word clause-finally.      d. àɲè    ká-támárí-nɛ̀n-í             kàlì   ríb        bàrì

                                           368
So, the temporal shifter bàrì refers to the fact that the entire event has happened fromyesterday onwards. In fact, no definite time reference is made about the stopping timeof the event.","[390, 391, 392]"
"Pronominal object suffixes can be cross-referenced on the imperative verb form but isdepending on the transitivity nature of the verb. If the verb in the imperative form istransitive, an object pronominal can be marked on the verb directly. If the verb is                                             333
ditransitive, there is no marking on the verb but just a free personal pronoun followsthe imperative verb form.(7.39)       a. éʤ-ò

                ‘Kill (sg.) him!’

           kill.PERV:IMP     DEM=man=NEAR
           ‘Kill (sg.) the man!’
Third person object marker is not marked on the imperative form of the verb, as can beseen in (7.39a). No mention of third person as direct or indirect object not even by afree pronoun, as shown below.(7.40)       a. áín-ɛ́47            àɲè
                give.PERV:IMP-TR 1sg

                give.PERV:IMP-TR
                ‘Give (sg.) him!’ or ‘Give (sg.) it to him!’
Second person possessive pronoun is avoided since it gives a reflective meaning to the
imperative form, as in (7.40c). In fact, (7.40c) would have a different form for a
reflexive or declarative sentence (7.58d).
         c. áín-ɛ́             sìɔ̀

         give.IMPERV-2sg.SU.IMPER hand-RSTR SG.PSD=2SG.PSR
         ‘Give your hand’
In order to make a command to an addressee that also involves a reflexive pronoun, anintransitive verb is preferred over a transitive. The intransitive process verb ér ‘die’will be used instead of the transitive action-process verb éʤ ‘kill, shoot’.","[356, 357]"

12.5 Polar questionsThe term polar question is a more appropriate label than ‘yes’ and ‘no’ question (Dixon2012: 377). As Dixon argues, some languages may lack words ‘yes’ and ‘no’ in theirlexicon and Mursi is one of them. Instead Mursi utilizes default interjections, negativeparticle word/particle or copula verbs ― see the examples given in (12.43a-c).(12.43) a.

            ‘Will you (m) spend the day at the town? No, I shall stay all day at
            home.’
Like in interrogative words, in polar questions, a constituent which is the focus takessentence-final position. In other words, it is the constituent with a raised intonation thatis expected to take the focus position and this could be by moving the constituent to theright most slot of the clause ―for example kíɲáŋ in (12.43a). In polar questions, if thesentence involves copula verb, obviously the copula complement will be a constituentupon which a high pitch rests, as in (12.43c).         c. ìɲè   án-í                             támárí
            2sg     COP.IMPERV-2sg.SU.IMPERV           student

            yes!    1sg        1SU-COP.IMPERV-1sg.SU.IMPERV          student
            ‘Are you (sg.) a student?’ ‘Yes, I am a student.’
In almost all cases, the syntactic order of constituents of declarative sentence and polarquestions are exactly the same. The English equivalents to the Mursi interjections inabove examples will be ɪmm ‘no’ and ɪɲɲ ‘yes’. It is quite common for interjections tohave a different phonology. For instance, both of these interjections contain a shortcentral vowel which is not part of the sound system of the language and may have amonosyllabic VCG shape (where G stands for geminates).","[552, 553]"

Mursi marks both S and A in the same way on the verb. Like the S of an intransitiveclause, any NP constituent can be in A position. The fact is that pronouns, proper nounsor common nouns in both A and O functions normally occur in citation form in theAVO constituent order. But, with regard to constituents that can fill the O position,there are at least certain distinctions between pronouns and proper/common nouns.","[478, 479]"

Mursi is a free-constituent order language; the order among adjectives within NPs andin sentences is relatively free. As to the ordering of adjectives within NPs, as has beennoted throughout this chapter, no more than two adjectival modifiers are available.   (i)      [N-ADJ1(size)-ADJ2(value)]NP… (8.58a)
   (ii)     [N-ADJ1(size)-ADJ2(colour)]NP…(8.58b)(8.58)    a. [[hòj-á       ràmàg-á      čàll-à]NP másábí]NP

"   Since this section is about the case system of the language, I prefer to mention twoterms from de Hoop and Malchukov (2008: 567) who also outlined two basic functionsof case marking ― identifying function and distinguishing function. Accordingly, theidentifying function of case encodes internal properties of the arguments, whereas thedistinguishing function of case encodes and depends on the relation between thearguments. The former is used more in case morphology to encode specificsemantic/pragmatic information about the nominal argument in question (p.567ff.). Forexample, the noun with nominative case in (10.26) is an agent [+control, +volitional,etc.].(10.26) .   àɲè  ɗág-áɲ-Ø                          hírí-ɔ́

            ‘The man beat me.’
As de Hoop and Malchukov (2008: 568) put it: ‘‘the distinguishing strategy is a morespecific strategy that is used for distinguishing between the two core arguments of atransitive clause, that is, the subject and the object’’. Example (10.26) above is atransitive clause thus it has two core arguments. Therefore, case has marked one of thearguments, the post-verbal subject is case-marked to avoid argument ambiguity. If thetwo arguments are already cross-referenced on the verb, one may of course ask why isthe case marking in (10.26) important. The simplest answer is; what if the object                                           470
argument in (10.26) is a noun or third person pronoun? This is due to the fact that whenthe object equals the subject in animacy and defineteness (as in (10.27), then thenominative case becomes the only way to distinguish the actual subject.(10.27)     [lúsì]O ɗág-Ø                 [hírí-ó]A

Interestingly, as can be shown in (10.2a), the verb-final suffix -ɔ̀ is the morphologicalmarker that shows the canonicity of this constituent order and is often added to anintransitive verbs in the imperfective aspect. However, this suffix is absent when theverb is in the perfective aspect or when manner modifiers and oblique arguments followthe intransitive imperfective verb ― compare the examples given below (10.2c-e).",[478]
"   As these morphological categories do not exclusively apply to each and everymembers of a particular word class, extensive morphological and syntactic criteria mustbe applied in order to distinguish one from the other before making either acharacterization statement or establishing exceptions. Moreover, as suggested inAikhenvald (2015: 81), morphological structure and categories on one hand, andsyntactic functional slots in a clause on the other hand are among the essential criteriafor distinguishing between word classes. Apart from the two productive criteria, onephonological criterion has been found to be a salient segmental property of verb rootsfor distinguishing verbs from the rest word classes, i.e. roughly 90 percent of Mursiverb roots end in consonants. This will be discussed in §7.2, Chapter 7. In addition,

"   Many Nilo-Saharan linguists (especially those who work on Eastern Sudaniclanguages) argue that verbs such as gurt ‘pull’ could indicate aspect by metathesis of― /gurt/ > [gurut] > [turug] > [tur>. However, the correct analysis is a t(V)- prefixingrule (morphological rule) that applies on the basis of phonotactic constrain rule(phonological rule) which follows: t(V)- prefixing /gurt/ > [t-gurt] >; deletion of /g/(consonant clusters are not allowed at word initial positions) > [turt], and finally we geta CVC shape > [tur]. However, that is not the case. In order to make such a claim, firstone has to properly understand the phonological rules of the language underinvestigation. In this regard, verb roots with a t-final consonant can be tricky.",[345]
"It should be noted that the omission of subject suffixes is sometimes related to thetransitivity of verbs and mood. The following conditions must be fulfilled that wouldgovern the entire co-occurrence relation between S/A and O suffixes:     i.          The second and third person subject suffixes can be omitted if they co-                 occur with the first person object suffix.     ii.

As it is a highly participant reference marking language, the information                 carried by the omitted subject marking suffixes must be retrievable from                 adjacent independent arguments or be recoverable from the context.",[335]

As it is shown in (10.42a-c), all arguments in O function are pronouns, for which at firstglance it appears to be the case that this applies when the O argument is a pronoun. But,the second option in (10.42c1) shows that the O argument can also be between theperfective negative particle ŋànì and the negated verb. In other word, the O argumentnow comes in its typical AOV order. From argument structuring point of view, the Oarguments can be optional constituents as long as they are indexed as pronominal formson the verb.

Unlike in declarative sentences in which both subjects of intransitive and transitiveverbs are obligatory marked on the verb, imperative sentences always drop markers ofboth subjects. In addition, in Mursi, both subject and the object of a transitive verb arecross-referenced on the verb. Semantically, object of a transitive verb and the recipient/beneficiary of a ditransitive verb are regarded as primary object, thus, they are cross-referenced on the verb. In the positive as well as negative imperatives, subject of any                                           337
transitivity class is not required, only object arguments are obligatorily marked on theverb.(7.47)      a. ŋà=éʤ-óɲ-í

There is also an interesting interaction between imperatives and adverbial words (timeand locative). Time words (adverbs) often occur at the beginning of a declarativesentence.(7.48)  a. ŋàmɛ́rɛ́   dáʃí
           now         do.PERV:IMP

           ʽDo now!ʼ or ‘Do it (sg.) right now!’
Locative adverbs are demonstrative constructions referring to distance. Distance
referring locative adverbs often constitute the last position of a sentence.

14.2.3.3 Indirect speech report markersIndirect speech reports can be intoducded in three major ways: (i) by the quotative ké(ii) by the subjunctive prefix k(V)-, and (iii) by the speech verb sén ‘say’ being used asauxiliary verb.

The verb ɗóŋá ‘put down’ of the direct speech has been adjusted to ɗɔ́t ‘leave’ in theindirect speech. Consequently as the deletion rule of the language it is only beingapplied to some word-final obstruents, the alveolar plosive /t/ is deleted. Note that thedemonstrative that is not a complementizer (or complement clause) marker. The lastindirect speech report marker is the speech verb ‘say’ in which it turns into an auxiliaryverb for the purpose of secondary role as complementizer. Even if unproductive.","[618, 619]"

However, the way syntactic Os can be coded in ditransitive clauses is different fromthe way two object arguments are coded in double-object clauses. The syntactic positionof O arguments in ditransitive clauses may rely on the semantic roles and animacystatus of the respective objects. Mütze (2014) noticed that the object of a mono-transitive verb is marked like a [+human] argument of the ditransitive verb for whichhuman arguments have semantic recipient roles. On the other hand, object and recipient(R) behave in the same way as primary objects while the theme (T) is a secondaryobject. Recall the object of monotransitive clauses given in the examples above andcompare with the following ditransitive clauses below.",[487]
