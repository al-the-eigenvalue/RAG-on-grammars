                     6.7. Relative order of direct objects and obliques
                             I have       argued        that     the       pragmatically                   wunmarked             order         of        verb,                     subject,            and       object             when             overt         now             phrases
                                                                                                                        are used is                     Verb-Subject-Object                   for        transitive               clauses               and        Verb-Subject               for                     intransitive              clauses.          These            orders       are       based        strictly              on syntactic                     role.    Accounting            for        the         order         of        direct            objects           and         obliques                     relative       to    one     another        is    less           straightforward.                    In    the    approximately                     1516    clause       corpus        upon which               the    conclusions                  of        this         chapter        are                     based         (Section        1.4),       postverbal               references              to both          an object           and    an                     oblique       participant           occur        in        120    clauses.           In 45%          of    these        120    clauses                     the     order       is Object-Obiique,                      and    in 55%           it is Oblique-Object.                           These                     figures       include        both     noun       and        clitic        encoding          of       the    referents.               They                     show    that    syntactic           role     alone           does       not    account           for       order.",[378]
"                             Givén    (to       appear)          proposes          that          the       basic        word        order           of      a                     language        be        determined           by        that         which          occurs        in        main,           active,       —                     declarative          clauses          used    in    contexts           in which         the     subject            is    definite                     and     easily        identified              and        in     which          the object           is indefinite                   but                     referential.              Presumably          he    is    referring            to     the    greatest          frequency             of                     a     certain        order        within

In particular,                      it constitutes                      some        degree       of                     explanation                 for            the              (apparently                    rare)           verb                initial              plus                     postpositional                    combination.

There            are,    however,           reasons           to    consider           that     it                     might     be something               other       than VSO,             Subject-Verb-Object                         (SVO)         being                     the     most         likely          alternative.

However,             I                     will      conclude           that          VSO        is       indeed      basic,         at        least       in typological                     terms,        though     perhaps           alternative            conclusions             could           be    drawn      in other                     theory-specific                terms         (Sections           7.1    and     7.2).

It    is       important        to keep          in mind         that    in                     all      languages                  there           is     probably            some         sensitivity           to      pragmatic                     factors.           In some           languages,              such    as       Papago,        pragmatic          factors        account                     for     just       about          all     ordering            phenomena,              and      consequently               there         is                     questionable                  value          in trying         to    force          them     into    a syntactic           ordering                     mold.     It is not                 clear       to me that we even want                        to talk           about          ‘basic’                     ordering            in        such           languages.             We    would         first       have    to    show     that        new                     information              is       more        (or    less)      basic           than        given       information;               that                     definite                information                  is     more         (or        less)      basic        than         indefinite                     information,                 etc.       And     it       is not clear           to me that we can do                      so.      Both                     new      and        given            information               are       clearly        essential          to    communication,                     though        it    may       be true           that         given        is        more      frequent,           at      least         in                     narrative           genres.","[50, 51]"

                     1.    Basic constituent order is VSO (order of direct object and
                           oblique may vary).
                     2.    Fronting of NP's (or other elements) to the left of the verb
                           is a possibility under pragmatically marked conditions.
                     3.    There is a tendency to move given information to end of the
                           clause (relative to the order of direct object and oblique).
                     4.    The language is agglutinative and polysynthetic.
                     5.    There is essentially no nominal case marking for subject and
                           object (but Set II clitics have case/pronominal features).
                     6.    Relative clauses are post-head.
                     7.    Descriptive modifiers are post-head.
                     8.    Relativization may be by deletion                     or by retention         of a
                           Set I or Set II clitic in the position relativized.
                     9.    Manner adverbs generally follow the verb.
                     10.   Auxiliaries precede the verb.
                     11.   The dominant       negative      particle néé precedes               the verb.
                     12.   (Some) modal formatives are affixal to the verb.
                     13.   Embedded verbs generally follow the embedding verb.
                     14.   Clausal objects follow the main verb.
                     15.   There is no overt copula.
                     16.   Placement of the yes/no question particle is specified with  _
                           reference to the beginning of clause (second position within C).
                     17.   In information questions, the questioned NP is fronted
                            ('movement' of questioned NPs from embedded clauses is also
                           a possibility at least for subjects).
                     18.   Some adverbial and complement clause types follow their main
                           clause (though conditionals and other -tiy clauses precede
                           their main clause).
                     19.   Complementizers precede their clause.","[406, 407]"

In    this        sense        it    is       the    presence           of        a verb         or                     predicate         which           guarantees           or     forces       the             assignment              of         grammatical                     relations             to         accompanying               noun         phrases.

                          As far as I know, there is no published    statement                                              of   features
                     typically  found  in  verb  initial  languages.    Keenan                                             (1978) on the
                     syntax        of    subject           final          languages              is      perhaps          the        nearest
                     approximation    to such    a   statement.    In   this appendix I include a
                     number of observations extracted from Keenan (1977)          'Summary of   Word
                     Order   Typelogy', and from Keenan (1979a)       ‘Word Order   Typologies:   The
                     Verb Initial Typology’.   I   have  recast the    observation s    in  complete

"                           11 Several studies have suggested that main                 clause    constituent
                     order      may     be     the   last     thing    to   change    historically,      after
                     adpositional, noun phrase, relative               clause,    and   other    subordinate
                     clause orders (cf. Antinucci et al. 1979, Hyman 1975, Li and Thompson
                     1974). Many more studies are needed before I would want                    to    conclude
                     that    this     is indeed a preferred tendency governing relative changes
                     in order, however. Ed Keenan (personal commmication) has pointed cut
                     the   case     of    Amharic    which     has many OV featu            res

                     historically. However, it         has    verb   initial    features    at    the   clause
                     level     due    to contact with surrounding languages. In a head marking
                     language like Yagua which 'avoids' noun phrases, it                   seems     plausible
                     that    a    tendency     toward    verb     initial order in naturally occurring
                     discovrse might develup prior to              fundamental      syntactic     changes    in
                     other     phrasal     categories.      I    leave    this   as   nothing     more  than  a

As discussed                   in     Chapter                 3        regarding                     order      of        genitives,            we       should          not         stop       at     statistics                     but        should                     investigate           the     principles           motivating                 the    observed           statistics.                         In    the                     case      of     major        clausal        constituents,                    postverbal             position                is unmarked                     whereas        preverbal        position            is    either              pragmatically                   or         semantically                     marked.         Part        of what       makes      something                'marked'          is    that          it       occurs              less                     frequently.            If    it were        to become             the    statistical                  norm,              by            dint        of                     sheer      frequency            it        would           likely          loose          its    marked         status.                  But       low                     frequency        is not        the     only        thing     which            makes       preverbal            positioning                         of                     subject        and     object    pragmatically                    marked.

The most we can conclude                             is that             neither       AOV                     nor    OAV    is probably           the       best         choice.          The     differences            across          the       other                     three        major         types        (VAO,       AVO,      and          OVA)     are    not      great       enough          to    give                     any     clear         indications.               When         we           compare         clauses             that        have        one                     preverbal           and      one        or    two      postverbal                 arguments         with       those       that       have                     just    postverbal           arguments,             there         is a difference                   of    26        to     19.        This                     (weakly)        suggests           that       a clause            may be more              likely         to    overtly          encode                     two    or more        arguments          when       one      of    those            arguments             is        pragmatically                     marked.

This         claims                    that         ‘'consistent'              languages           will        serialize                  all        operators           (modifiers)                     to    one    side     of        their operands                 (heads).               The         NSP         is     a      bivalued                  and                     implicational                   statement            of        the form:               if P,        then Q            (P —>           Q).

Neither         of                     these         definitemess                   criteria              really               distinguishes                between               SVO    and     VSO                     orders,          since          both        configurations                        can         be        used        to      encode               definite                     information                or to introduce                     indefinite-reterential                                    information.                  There                     is no       necessary                 relationship                      between                   definiteness                 and          one        order                     versus           the        other            in         Yagua.               In actual              fact,        the       number           of    clauses                     with       two     overt         noun        phrases           in natural                     text       meeting           either               Mallinson                     and     Blake's            or    Givén's            criteria                 is    extremely                 small       and     does           not    allow                     us    to    conclude             anything               with       certainty.","[404, 405]"
