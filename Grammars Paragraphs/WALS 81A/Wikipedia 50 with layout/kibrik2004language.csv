"3.2. Word order
Alutor has free word order. It is often difficult to claim which order is basic.
Discontinuous constituents are also possible.",[123]
"3.2.1. Word order in a predicate-argument structure
In verbal clauses the most frequent word order structures are SVO and VSO:(29) a. tita·qa        qutkinJnJaqu-nak          maN.ki·@ana
          one.day      Qutkinnaqu-ERG+SG         somewhere

           One day Qutkinnaqu found [=saw] a fish somewhere. [1:2]    b. ga-nvy-lin                      qutkinJnJaqu-nak             tylgy-lNyn

           Qutkinnaqu poked it (with his) finger {RC: and suddenly shouted.}. [1:8]     In nominal clauses with adjectival predicates 125 both word order structures —
SV and VS — are possible:(30) a. myri             mur-i                ga-qe.takalN-a                  ny-katgu-muri.

"3.2.2. Word order in noun phrases
A modifier can precede as well as follow the NP head.",[124]
"1.3.4.3. Syllable Addition
It appears that the rhythmic structure of the language does not permit stress to fall on
the last syllable of a word, but strings with the last stressed syllable may appear at
intermediate stages of derivation (see rules I and II). In order to improve the rhythmic
structure a supplementary syllable is added.
      The syllable addition rules run as follows:
      if the stress falls on the last (closed) syllable of a word, a supplementary
syllable of the |CV| type is added by means of geminating the last consonant and     35
         In Alutor there are neither stressed disyllabics with the second light syllable nor stressed
disyllabics with the first light and the second open syllable.
      36
         Otherwise, i.e. if the first syllable is light, the word does not acquire any stress.",[25]
"
2.3.1.3. Local semantic functions
A noun phrase can also express different types of location (location with respect to
the object expressed by a base noun). These functions are expressed either by a
derivative suffix (in the case there is a contact between the objects or at least it is
implied) or by an adposition governing the locative noun phrase (in the case there is
no obvious contact between the objects), for details see [Muravyova 1994].
       In order to express functions of the first type, a nominal derivative with a
locative suffix is used. In general, such derivatives have complete paradigms
including the nominative, but the most frequent forms are cases with locative
functions, such as the locative, the dative (with an allative function), the lative and the
prolative.
       The following local functions are expressed by means of suffixes:
       SUPER ‘surface of an object’, the marker -lq (with the variant -lJq), for
instance: Najy-lJqy-N ‘(climb) the mountain’ [8:38], gytgy-lq-epyN ‘(migrate) along
the surface of the lake’ [16:7], ujatiki-lJqy-k ‘(load smth.) on the sledge’ [22:66],
vylJusa-lJqy-k ‘(put smth.) on a dish’ [29:27];
       IN ‘inner part of an object’, the marker -giN, for instance: ulJgyv-giN-ki ‘in the
grave’ [5:10], ulJgyv-giN-gypyN ‘(shout) from the grave’ [7:59], syge-giN-ki ‘(hide) in
the sands’ [18:18], tygar-giN-kyN ‘(go) inside the store-hole’ [21:73];
       INTER ‘place among objects’, the marker -swyn/-lwyn, for instance: tumykka-
lwyny-k ‘(to talk about smth.) in the presence of other people’ [22:68], ra.mky-swyn-
i ‘(to visit) all the houses’ [28:2], Ne-swyny-k ‘(to live) among the mountains’ [32:4];
                                                 101
       APUD ‘place near an object’, the marker -teny, for instance: ra-teny-k ‘(to
dance) by the neighbouring house’ [39:4], inmy-teny-k ‘(to build a village) near the
cliff’ [23:3], ynykka-teny-k ‘(to put smth.) near himself’ [29:21].
       If there is no obvious contact between the two objects, adpositions 108
expressing various local functions are used (they govern the locative case form), cf.
ymiNqal tynupy-k ‘behind a hill’, ujatiki-k gytulNyNqal ‘at the side of a sledge’,
rymetyNqal tynupy-k ‘far behind a hill’, inmy-k telyNqal ‘on the other side of a rock’,
tilirra-k semyk ‘near Tilirran {the village Tilichiki}’.","[101, 102]"
"2.1.1.2.1. Agreement in perfective potential
A fragment of the paradigm of the perfective potential aspect-mood forms can be
used in order to gain some preliminary familiarity with the person-number agreement
system. In Tables 2 and 3 schematic paradigms of intransitive and transitive verbs are
presented, showing, for the purposes of clarity, only agreement markers55 .",[43]

                                                      108
       Besides demonstrative adjectives, there are also demonstrative adverbs derived
from the same roots: wutku ‘here’, wutkepyN ‘from here’, Nanyk ‘there’, igynNinak
‘that is why’ and others. In order to express great distance from the speaker and the
hearer the iconic vowel lengthening is used (see 1.3.8.1), for instance, instead of
Nanyk ‘there’ the form NOnyk ‘far over there’ is often used.","[108, 109]"
"3.0. Basic notions
In this study of Alutor syntax we do not use such t r a d i t i o n a l syntactic notions as
subject and object since, in our opinion, their common usage is not congruent with
the internal structure of Alutor and would merely lead to misunderstanding. In this
case it is more advisable to use more neutral notions based on a framework of core
arguments constituting the base of clause syntactic structure (for the grounds of the
opposition “core vs. peripheral arguments” see [Kibrik 1998]).
        There is a restricted number of core arguments in a clause. If there is only one
core argument in a clause 116 , the clause (as well as its predicate) is i n t r a n s i t i v e .
This argument is called the S - a r g u m e n t (Sole) irrespective of its semantic role. If
there are two core arguments in a clause, the clause (as well as its predicate) is
t r a n s i t i v e . A transitive clause has an agent-like A - a r g u m e n t (Agentive) and a
patient-like P- a r g u m e n t (Patientive).
        In our case, this terminology is preferable because it does not ascribe a
particular syntactic pattern to Alutor clause structure, keeping this fundamental
question open for further investigation, as there is not yet enough data to resolve this
problem.",[110]
"     23
         Let us be reminded once again that the rules are given here in the order they should apply
to the underlying representation.
      24
         After the described operation, some other modifications take place (for instance, the
segments y and @ are epenthesized).",[17]
"2.3.4. Noun incorporation
A noun in the nominal can by incorporated by a verb or other noun. Thus, we have
v e r b a l composites, with a verb as the head, and n o m i n a l composites, with a
noun as the head, (for details see 3.1.4). An adjectival (= denominal adjective) can
also be incorporated (see 2.2.4 above). Incorporated nouns have no category markers;
incorporated denominal adjectives may preserve their adjectivizers -kin and -in,
which are referred to as derivational affixes.
        Nouns are easily incorporated when they have no modifiers in the underlying
syntactic structure, and the speaker refers to the corresponding objects as background
                                                   103
information (for details see 3.1.4).
      Nouns are incorporated by other nouns when they are used attributively in the
underlying structure and denote non-specific objects, for instance: tanNy=@irra-n
‘the enemy party’ [21:10], Hasu=nym.jyr@y-n ‘a village of pink salmon’ [3:21],
viHe=rara-Na ‘a grass house’ [6:16], wir=imyt ‘the load of alder bark’ [7:8]. Not all
linguists consider this type of compounding incorporation, but it is obviously a highly
productive type of compounding.","[103, 104]"

                                               12
       No connection is found between syllable boundaries and morpheme boundaries.
At the same time, there is an obvious correlation between morpheme boundaries and
the position of epenthetic schwas: the schwa often plays the role of an
“intermorpheme segment”, cf. ní-mky-qin = n-y-mk-y-qin (< {n-mk-qin})
‘numerous’ (see 1.3.3.2).
       The morphology of Alutor combines morphemes in such a way that an
underlying representation may be ill-formed. It may have illicit sound strings, such as
initial syllables without onsets, illicit consonant clusters, hiatus etc. Illicit strings
usually appear word-initially and word-finally, and also at morpheme boundaries 18 .
In order to obtain well-formed words, we must modify the underlying representation
by means of certain phonological rules, among them initial consonant deletion, glottal
stop epenthesis, schwa epenthesis, and hiatus vowel deletion (see 1.3.2 and 1.3.3).","[12, 13]"
"3.3.2. Taxonomic clauses
Taxonomic clauses indicating the membership of a nominal argument in a class of
objects have two main patterns. T h e f i r s t , most natural pattern is a combination of
two adjacent NPs, one of them being the S-argument, and the other the predicate:(37) a. qutawwyjNy-nin                           qetakalNy-n          HaqaniNvit

          Aqaningvit is your own brother. [30:16]     In (37a) the order of NPs is SV, in (37b) it is inversed: VS. The nominal
argument can be expressed as a demonstrative/deictic pronoun wuttin ‘this’:(38)      wutt.in          kysim=@ujpy-lNyn,               wutt.in          lyla=@ujpy-lNyn,

          for the eyes. This is a stick for the liver. [14:13]      The head of a predicate NP is marked with the predicative form of a noun (see
2.3.2), namely the overt personal markers controlled by 1st/2nd person S-arguments:(39)      tita-kin-egym        gymmy(N)         gy.nin-egym          Nav.akk-egym.

          Once I was your daughter. [6:33]      In the predicate NP titakin-egym gy.nin-egym Navakk-egym ‘your once upon
a time daughter’ its head Navakk-egym, as well as modifiers agree in person-number
with the S-argument.
      T h e s e c o n d pattern uses the verb it- that has in this context the meaning
‘be, serve as’ <smb.: N, as smb.: Eq>. This verb is compatible with the values of all
verbal categories in accordance with the semantics of the clause. In the predicate
position the noun is marked with the equative:(40) a. jaqqy       ynnu              a-lJylJa-ki-nu              n-it-qin.

            (Once) a rich man Qisgayat became sick. [29:4]      In example (61) the form pyttuNy-l@y-n ‘the rich’ is derived from the adjective
ny-pyttuN-qin ‘rich’. Such forms can be used both attributively (as appositions) and
non-attributively (as nouns). Being used attributively, they agree in case and number
with the head noun.
      The highest degree of quality can also be expressed by means of the suffix -s@,
identical with the verbal attributivizer expressing intense actions. The suffix is often
accompanied by the prefix am-, cf.:(62) a. y-nanny                Nita.q         mata-ni-nat

            They were dressed in the most beautiful fur coats 99 {RC: and were going around the

      Another way to express a high degree of quality is to add the prefix ynan- (yn-
ynnuxwin ynan-@yssaNi ‘Here is the youngest (daughter), this one’ [32:12]), often
accompanied by the suffix -s@ (cf. ynan-meNy-s@y-n qylik=tytka ‘the biggest male
walrus’ [22:14]).
      In a comparative construction the object of comparison appears in the dative
case, while the adjective is in its usual form, but with the incorporated quantifier
Hopty- ‘most’:(63)        ... gymmy          turyky-N           ny-Hopty=katgu-jgym ...

object for each possible subject of the action.","[86, 87]"

1.3.3. Insertions
The following types of insertions occur in Alutor:
      1) glottal stop insertion;
      2) schwa insertion.
      In order to formulate the schwa insertion rules we need two additional rules
which describe marking irrelevant morpheme boundaries and metathesis of a schwa
and a consonant.",[21]
"1.3. Phonological Processes
Alutor exhibits a great variety of phonological processes22 . Here we find various
segmental changes − a l t e r n a t i o n s , as well as root copying − r e d u p l i c a t i o n s .
Among alternations there are replacements (including assimilations of different types,
lenitions and fortitions, coalescences, etc.), insertions and deletions, and also
metatheses. The most important phonological process in Alutor is that of creating the
right syllable and rhythmic structure: some phonological processes help to create the
right structure, while others take place only after the right structure has been created.
Most Alutor alternations are phonologically conditioned, but there are also many
alternations that are morphologically conditioned (the latter will be described in this
section too).
       Alutor phonological processes are represented here in the form of rewriting
rules. The rules apply to the underlying representation of a word, that is a sequence of
underlying representations of morphemes constituting the word. Underlying
representations of morphemes are given in the Dictionary − see Part III. The result of
application is the surface representation, i.e. the phonetic transcription of a given
word. The rules are listed here in the order they should apply to the underlying
representation (the only exception is mentioned in 1.3.3.2).
       The majority of rules given below describe various segment modifications; they
are numbered with Arabic numerals. There are also the stress assignment rules – they
are numbered with Roman numerals. Besides, there are some additional rules that do
not change the structure of words, but mark syllable boundaries and types of syllables
– they are numbered with capital letters.
       Each rule is given in two variants: as an ordinary utterance and as a formal rule.
The notation we use for formal rules is X ⇒ Y / A_B, which means that a segment
(or a string of segments) X is replaced by a segment (or a string of segments) Y in the
context defined by A_B. The bar “ _ ” marks the position of the segment undergoing
the process. The context A and B may contain: symbols for consonants and vowels –
C and V, their phonological properties (shown by the lowered script), a morpheme
(M) the segment belongs to - a root (R) or an affix (this is marked with “ ∈ ”), some
     22
          Here we follow the logical classification of phonological processes given in [Mel’иuk
1996].",[16]

3.1.4. Incorporation
3.1.4.1. Syntax of incorporation
Syntactically incorporation can be described as a process resulting in some
constituent (t a r g e t o f i n c o r p o r a t i o n ) being deprived of its independent
syntactic position and being included in the stem of a word that immediately governs
it (g o a l o f i n c o r p o r a t i o n ). Incorporation does not obligatorily entail the
change of the argument structure, its functions are more general, therefore in this
section it is reasonable to consider this process from the point of view of its syntactic
potential in general.
       The goal of incorporation can be the head of a VP (the verb) or of a NP (the
noun). As a result v e r b a l and n o m i n a l compounds 123 appear. Any modifiers of
VPs and NPs can be the targets of incorporation. They can belong to different word
classes.
       The types of targets will be considered separately for VPs and NPs.","[117, 118]"

                                                13
         In unaccentuated words the vowel length contrast is hardly detectable. It should
be noted that unaccentuated words can be clearly distinguished only if the syllable
supposed to bear stress is an open one, cf. jônut [A] ‘today’ vs. &janut [a] ‘earlier’
(the symbol “ & ” indicates the absence of stress in a word), @inøri [I] ‘blanket’ vs.
&siriri [i] ‘sandpiper’. If such syllable is a closed one, it is more difficult to reveal the
absence of stress.
         The position of stress in Alutor can be described in terms of syllable weight,
thus it is a quantity sensitive system. Two types of syllables are distinguished here:
l i g h t (mono-moraic) syllables and h e a v y (bi-moraic) syllables. Syllables of the
|Сy| type are light syllables, while the other types are all heavy.
         The position of stress in accentuated words is determined by the following three
phonological constraints:
         1) only a heavy syllable can bear stress; light syllables are always unstressed;
         2) only the first or the second syllable can bear stress (but the second syllable is
preferable);
         3) a word-final syllable cannot bear stress.
         These constraints help us to describe all the possible rhythmic patterns. First of
all, a monosyllabic cannot bear stress, for its only syllable is the final one (but there
exist some unaccentuated monosyllablic auxiliary words − see below). In case of a
disyllabic accentuated word, the first syllable is stressed (it always appears to be a
heavy one), for instance, @ôkyk ‘son’, kíttil ‘forehead’, wôla ‘knife’ 20 . Polysyllabics
may have stress either on the first or the second syllable, cf. tølpyqal ‘shoulder’,
tírgytyr ‘meat’, nØgyqin ‘cool’, vitôtyk ‘work’, NyrôlNyn ‘knee’, vagílNyn ‘nail, claw’.
For details see the stress assignment rules (1.3.4.).
         The class of unaccentuated words is represented by the following groups and
subgroups:
         1) auxiliary words of different types, such as conjunctions, particles,
introductory words, and also some adverbs, cf. &qinaq ‘in order to’, &Horo ‘then’,
&matka ‘whether’, &kytvyl ‘not (prohibition)’, &gemat ‘maybe’, &agi ‘very’, &lygan
‘even’, &wasaq ‘sometimes’, &jaqi ‘later’;
         2) some personal pronoun forms, such as:
         a) the dative form with a light second syllable, cf. &gymykyN ‘to me’, &gynykyN
‘to you (sg)’, &@ynykyN ‘to him’, &murykyN ‘to us’, &turykyN ‘to you (pl)’, &@ytykyN     20
         Actually, when morphemes are combined into a word, at intermediate stages there may
appear a monosyllabic word with the only stressed syllable or a disyllabic word with the second
stressed syllable, but such intermediate representations are then extended by means of some
special rules (see 1.3.4.3), cf. Nôjjy (< Nôj < {Naj-∅}) ‘mountain’, Nyvã-jjy (< Nyvã-j < {Nvu-j})
‘(s)he/it began’, gyvô-kki (< gyvô-k < {gva-k}) ‘to stick’.","[13, 14]"

"1.3.4. Stress Assignment Algorithm
In order to create the right rhythmic structure, we need three types of rules:
      1) rules regulating syllabification – the syllabification rules proper and the
syllable marking rules (1.3.4.1);
      2) rules regulating accentuation – the stress assignment rules (1.3.4.2);     31
        As this rule describes only the boundary marking, not a phonological process, it is
numbered with a capital letter.

        Metathesis of this type is attested not only for dentalveolars, but also for some other types
of consonants. For example, the same change occurs when one of the consonants is the causative
marker − the prefix -n-, while the other consonant is not a dentalveolar, cf. myt-y-n-gyjulavyn (<
{myt-n-g(y)jul-av-n}) ‘we taught him/her’ (the root {g(y)jul}), cf. nojulqin (< ny-gjul-qin < {n-

3.1.4.2. Semantics of incorporation
Incorporation is a device that simplifies the syntactic structure of a clause. It
                                                  121
decreases the syntactic rank of constituents that are out of the scope of assertion and,
more generally, beyond the focus of attention 124 . If incorporation affects the
constituent that occupies a prestigious position in a clause, it opens the possibility of
raising the status of another constituent occupying a peripheral position in the initial
structure.
      Along with this, it is possible to confirm the usage of incorporation for the
purpose of overcoming syntactic restrictions over syntactic structure. For example, -
l@- participles form reduced relative clauses whose nominative argument is
coreferential with the head NP. With respect to this restriction it is sometimes
necessary to free the nominative position, incorporating the P-argument of a transitive
verb:(25) y.ninny             unJunJu               qur=etaty-l@-u                    ity-tkyn.
           his/her+3sg     child+NOM+SG            reindeer=drive-ATR-EQUAT          be-IPF
     {LC: Patat used him as a worker, and} his son was a reindeer drover. [16:11]      To illustrate the functions of incorporation, consider the following example:(26) g-akmi.l-lin                  rynny=Hal                 to
      RES-take-RES+3sg.P           horn=axe+NOM+SG           and
      ga-lJHinJnJy=svi-l(in)         ynki      naqam         milJgy=ttu-l@aty-l@y-n.
      RES-neck=cut-RES+3sg.S         here      at.once       fire=blow-ITER-ATR-NOM+SG
              (The man) took a horn axe and instantly cut off the head [=cut the neck] of the one
      (who was) blowing fire. [18:11]
       In (26) there are three incorporation compounds. The expression rynny=Hal
‘horn axe’ is idiomatic, it refers to an artifact. The compound galJHinJnJy=svil(in) ‘cut
the neck’ allows to heighten the status of the possessor, expressed by the
substantivized participle milJgy=ttul@atyl@yn ‘the one who was blowing fire’. Note
that incorporated P-argument of the verb ‘blow’ allows to form this type of participle
referring to the performer of the action.","[120, 121, 122]"
"2.1.1.2.3. Pure non-transparent agreement markers
Now let us consider pure n o n - t r a n s p a r e n t markers, presented in boldface in
Table 3. These markers are specific in the sense that it is difficult to ascribe to them a
single person-number value of an A/P-argument. It is easy to see that these markers
usually simultaneously take account of person-number values of both the A- and P-
arguments of transitive verbs. To be more precise, these markers are present with the
following combinations of person-number values of A- and P-arguments:      A     P          Agreement markers
      2nsg 3           -tki
      3sg 3            -ni
      3nsg 1/2/3       na-
      3sg 2            na-
      3sg/2 1nsg       na-
      3sg/2 1sg        ina-      What is a motivation of this united expression of A/P-person-number values? In
our description the interpretation of these markers is based on the Deictic Hierarchy
mentioned above (see Figure 1). In this Hierarchy the arguments' person-number
values are ordered in accordance with the principle of m a r k e d n e s s r e v e r s a l
with respect to A/P-positions. Namely, the leftmost member of the Hierarchy
                                               51
generally harmonizes with the A-role, and the rightmost member with the P-role.
Therefore the A-role is mostly unmarked for the ‘I’-argument, and the P-role for the
‘they’-argument, and vice versa, the A-role is generally marked for the ‘they’-
argument, and P-role for the ‘I’-argument. With respect to the intermediate positions
of the Deictic Hierarchy, markedness of the A-role increases in the Hierarchy from
left to right, whereas markedness of the P-role increases from right to left. The critical
point of this Hierarchy is the boundary between locutors and non-locutors. It is
normal for locutors to play the A-role 69 , whereas it is normal for non-locutors to play
the P-role. The following person-number combinations of A- and P-roles are
congruent with this tendency 70 :
       A              P
       I        — you sg/you nsg/him/them
       we       — you sg/you nsg/him/them
       you sg — him/them      It is easy to see that these combinations of deictic categories trigger the regular
(pure and combined) agreement markers. Deviations from the regular coding are
found in the context of the following person-number A- & P-combinations:      A                P
      you sg —         me/us
      you nsg —        me/us /him/them
      he      —        me/us /you sg/you nsg/him/them
      they    —        me/us /you sg/you nsg/him/them      It is exactly these combinations that trigger non-transparent agreement markers
(see boldfaced markers in Table 3). However, the various combinations of deictic
values trigger different types of non-transparent markers, thus a more precise
formulation is needed. In general the choice of non-transparent coding depends on the
values of both arguments of the transitive verb, nevertheless the starting point for the
choice is the deictic properties of one of them. In the following cases it is the A-
argument:
      (a) the most deictically unnatural, i.e. the most marked A-argument (= ‘they’) needs the non-
transparent marker (na-);
     69
        Moreover, locutor can play the P-role in case when the A-role is also occupied by locutor
outranking the former in the Deictic Hierarchy.
     70
        English pronominal constructions are used for the sake of clarity.","[51, 52]"

      The category m o o d is also obligatory. It has four values:
      - i n d i c a t i v e (IND), does not have its own specific markers;
      - o p t a t i v e (OPT), does not have its own specific markers 48 ;
      - p o t e n t i a l (POT), circumfix marker ta-...(-N) 49 , framing the verb stem;
      - c o n j u n c t i v e (CONJ), prefix marker @-/A- 50 .
      Besides these, in Alutor there is also an impersonal form of the i m p e r a t i v e
(see 2.1.3).
      Finally, the finite verb agrees 51 in person and number with its core arguments,
distinguishing three persons (1st/2nd/3rd person) and three numbers — s i n g u l a r
(sg), d u a l (du) and p l u r a l (pl) 52 . Intransitive verbs agree with their sole core
argument (S - a r g u m e n t ) marked with the nominative, and have, aspect and mood
being fixed, 9 person-number forms. The transitive verb agrees simultaneously with
the agentive argument (A - a r g u m e n t ) marked with the ergative as well as with the
patientive argument (P - a r g u m e n t 53 ) marked with the nominative, and has, aspect
     48
         The mood value is coded cumulatively, together with person-number values, see below.
     49
          The suffix component of the circumfix can be covert, for example, in imperfective
potential. The potential marker coincides with desiderative marker (see 2.1.3 below).
      50
         The marker A- is a phonetic variant of the marker @- in specific positions (see 1.3.6).
      51
         In Alutor the person-number markers are combined with the unmarked usage of personal
pronouns in the core argument positions, so it is possible to interpret them as agreement markers.
      52
          As the paradigms show, semantically this tripartite personal opposition has its own
internal structure. The opposition ‘singular — non-singular’ (sg — nsg) consists of six deictic
items. Elementary single entities are defined in terms of speech act participants (1sg = ‘speaker’,
2sg = ‘hearer’) and non-participants of the speech act (3sg = ‘somebody’). Non-singular entities
are totalities of elementary entities: 1nsg = ‘speaker and hearer/somebody’, 2nsg = ‘hearer and
somebody’, 3nsg = ‘somebody and somebody’ (i.e. the countable number opposition of
homogenous entities is present only in the 3rd person). Exactly these entities are ordered in the
Deictic Hierarchy (see Figure 1 below). The arrangement of non-singular entities with respect to
singular entities is semantically motivated. Thus, ‘1nsg’ includes, besides the speaker, the hearer
and/or the 3rd person. Such an entity is lower on the Hierarchy than ‘1sg’. Simultaneously this
entity is higher than ‘2sg’, because it includes the speaker, and this factor is most important for
the Hierarchy. The motivation for ‘2nsg’ is similar.
      Within the scope of the non-singular there is a proper number opposition of dual and plural
(du and pl), because the number of homogenous elementary entities increases, and this opposition
uses iconically specific coding devices (see 2.1.1.2.4). Dual does not have a surface expression (it
is possible to postulate the zero marker), and plural is expressed by a specific morpheme —
pluralizer -la.
      In that way the prototypical number opposition is represented in the subsystem of 1/2nd
person nsg, and partially in 3rd person sg/nsg.
      53
         See 3.1.6 on agreement with the addressee argument.","[40, 41]"
"1.1.1.3. Long and Short e and o
Vowels e and o always appear as long segments in open stressed or open pre-stressed
syllables (that is in the first or the second syllable of an Alutor word − see 1.2), cf.
@ógyv [E] ‘yesterday’, jepílNyn [E] ‘hoof’, tùrak [O] ‘sink’, lJotítkyn [O] ‘top’.
      Short e and o are found in several roots in closed stressed and closed pre-
stressed syllables before or after q and H, cf. lóqtyk [e] (along with løqtyk) ‘come
back’, HoptílJHu [o] ‘all’, qùnpyN [o] (along with qãnpyN) ‘always’. In post-stressed
syllables, both open and closed, the vowels e and o are usually short, cf. @ísse [e]
‘aunt’, tytôtoratkyn [o] ‘I'll sink’. The latter situation can be treated as standard
vowel shortening in post-stressed position − see 1.3.7 5 . Short e and o are also found
in non-accentuated auxiliary words (see 1.2.2), cf. &gemat [e] ‘maybe’, &Horo [o]
‘then’ (non-accentuated words are marked with “ & ”).
      Long E and O are also found in both open and closed syllables in so-called
“expressive” words, cf. tOk ‘(interjection) let us’ (for more details see 1.3.8.1).
Expressive lengthening of this kind can be found in many languages, but such long
vowels are not considered separate phonemes.
      Thus, in Alutor long and short e and o occur in positions that complement each
other. That is why we find it possible to treat a long phone and its short counterpart as     4
        It is worth mentioning that native speakers of Alutor are not aware of the schwa as a
segment of their pronunciation, whether predictable or not. They think some Alutor words have
only consonants; at the same time, they can easily divide such words into syllables. For instance, a
word which sounds like pyNílly ‘news’ is treated as having three syllables – |p|Nl|l| (the symbol “ |
” indicates syllable boundaries), wítwyt ‘flower’ – as |wt|wt|, HítvyHyt ‘boat’ – as |Ht|v|Ht|. The
same is true for the Koryak language. E.A.Kreynovich [Kreynovich 1958] proposed for Koryak
words the non-vocalised representation (that is without y), but with marked syllable boundaries,
like |wt|wt|. Since the schwa is not part of such representation, the author does not consider it a
phoneme. In our opinion, such approach in neither adequate nor typologically justified, because
there arises a problem of dividing words into syllables – some words have unpredictable syllable
division. Nevertheless, E.A.Kreynovich was the first to pay attention to the crucial importance of
the notion of syllable for Chukchi-Kamchatkan languages. As we will see further, this notion is
absolutely necessary to create well-formed Alutor words.
      5
        From an historical point of view, the Alutor long E and O originated mostly from aj and
aw, or from yj and yw, and original e and o changed into i and u in most positions (they are
preserved only in closed syllables before or after q and H – see above), cf. the following related
words from Alutor and Koryak: Alutor jepílNyn [E] – Koryak jajpylNyn ‘hoof’, Alutor lJotítkyn
[O] – Koryak lJawtytkyn ‘the top of smth.’, Alutor @imNãlyk – Koryak @emNolyk ‘to miss (smb.)’,
but Alutor lóqtyk – Koryak leqtyk ‘to come back’, Alutor qùnpyN – Koryak qonpyN ‘always’
(these correspondences are discussed in detail in [Muravyova 1986a]).",[5]

an adjective's truth domain:(55) a.    ...lyqlaN-ki             Hopta      tavHal-u                   a-mal-ka-wwi

the desiderative marker specifying the modal description of the event: the infinitive
designates that the agent of the event attempts to accomplish the action:(57) a. imjaq         yjava.k        ynpy=qura-Na                      kytawyt

2.2. Adjectives
Alutor shows a clear morphological opposition between two classes of adjectives:
q u a l i t a t i v e adjectives and r e l a t i v e adjectives. These classes of adjectives
have different markers and belong to different derivation types. Qualitative adjectives
appear as an original lexical group, while relative adjectives are derived from other
parts of speech (mostly nouns).
        From a syntactic point of view adjectives are used either a u t o n o m o u s l y
(i.e. as separate words, usually attributes or predicates), or in i n c o r p o r a t i o n . An
adjective can be used attributively only when its head noun is marked for the
nominative (see 2.2.4). In this case an attribute agrees in p e r s o n and n u m b e r
with its head noun. If an adjective is used predicatively, it also agrees in person and
number with its S-actant, so the forms used in both situations are identical. In the case
its head noun is not a nominative case form, an adjective is usually incorporated (for
details see 2.2.4).
        We will first consider qualitative and relative adjectives used autonomously,
and then discuss adjective incorporation.","[81, 82, 83, 84]"

In order to write Alutor words we use a simplified variant of the phonetic
transcription, which we refer to as the practical transcription. The simplifications we
use are the following:
      1) we omit the glottal stop in word-initial position before a vowel, cf. alpínNyn
[@alpínNyn] ‘patch’;
      2) in most words we do not mark vowel length on e and o (see 1.1.1.3), cf.
jepílNyn [jEpílNyn] ‘hoof’, rarôtenyk [rarÔtenyk] ‘near a house’, but we do mark the
length of e and o in expressive words (see 1.1.1.3), cf. qolomE [qolomE] ‘that’s
great!’;
      3) we do not mark vowel length on stressed vowels i, u, a occuring in open
syllables, cf. tøtyk [tØtyk] ‘I was’;
      4) we always mark vowel length on originally long vowels I, U, A, except in
closed syllables, cf. jØlyjil [jØlyjil] ‘tongue’, jIlítkuk [jIlítkuk] ‘gossip’;
      5) we usually transcribe the palatalized correlate of t as s (except some rare
examples in texts when it is pronounced like tJ), cf. nysôsaqin ‘tasty’.
      And finally, since the stress assignment rules in Alutor are rather simple, we do
not mark stress in Alutor words except in this section.","[33, 34, 35, 36]"
"2.2.1. Qualitative adjectives
Qualitative adjectives belong to the class of original predicates denoting various kinds
of qualities and properties. They have at least one actant, that is an S-actant (the
subject of a quality or property).
      Qualitative adjectives are marked with the circumfix n-...-qin(a) (further
shortened to n-...-qin), the same as that used with verbal adjectives (see 2.1.2). The
prefixal part n- appears in all qualitative adjectives, so it marks the part of speech,
while the suffixal part -qin(a) is used only with the 3rd person S-actant, so it
expresses both the part of speech and the person(-number) agreement. With the 1st or
2nd person the standard monopersonal markers are used (see Table 11 above). A
sample of person-number adjective forms is given in Table 12.",[84]
"2.3.1.2. Case functions
Below we enumerate the main functions of the Alutor cases.
      The n o m i n a t i v e is used mostly to express the syntactic function of an S/P-
actant, that is the Absolutive hyperrole, according to the ergative actant marking
strategy (see 3.0). The nominative (not a bare stem) is also used to express named
objects. Besides this, the nominative is used in the vocative position, with final vowel
lengthening (we treat this process as expressive vowel lengthening − see 1.3.8.1), for
instance, in the vocative we may use miti along with mitE 107 ‘Oh, Miti!’ (Miti is a
mythological woman’s name).
      The e r g a t i v e is used to express the following functions: a) the A-actant of a
verb, that is the actant with an Agentive hyperrole, b) the instrument of an action, c)
the lowered actant of a verb in the antipassive construction (see 3.1.3.1). Beside the
Agent, the Agentive hyperrole in Alutor also includes the Experiencer. Thus, the
Agentive hyperrole is typical for verbs such as ‘take’, ‘cut’ (the Agent) / ‘see’, ‘wish’
(the Experiencer):(69) a. qutkinJnJaqu-nak            g-akmi.l-lin               utty-@ut ...
           Qutkinnaqu-ERG+SG        RES-take-RES+3sg.P         stick-NOM+SG
     105
         These variants appear because the inflection -jpyN historically comes from the root {jp},
and undergoes changes given in rule (11) (see 1.3.6) either as a root or a suffix.
     106
         Here and in some other cases the vowel y is epenthetic.
     107
         We call this form the “expressive” vocative.",[97]
"
1.1.1.2. Phonological Status of Schwa
The phonological status of schwa is one of the most interesting problems of the
Chukchi-Kamchatkan phonology. Some authors (see, for instance, [Zhukovа 1968])
regard this vowel as a purely auxiliary segment and do not include it in the inventory
of phonemes. Actually, the fact that the schwa is predictable in many contexts is
rather obvious. In such cases the surface representation of a word containing y can be
derived from the underlying representation without y (= the “non-vocalized”
representation) by means of simple insertion rules (see 1.3.3.2). For example, if a
word sounds like tyjôtyk ‘I came’, it can be derived from *tjatk. Here the schwas
break up the word-initial and the word-final consonant clusters. Thus, in this word, as
well as in many other words, y is just an epenthetic. This means that the schwa is     1
      Previously, long vowels were found neither in Alutor nor in any other Chukchi-
Kamchatkan language (cf. [Moll 1955; Zhukova 1968] and others).",[3]

                                                       95
       The final vowel truncation is accompanied by standard phonological processes,
cf. tatul (root {tatula}) ‘fox’, but akyk (root {akka}) ‘son’, imyt (root {imti}) ‘burden’
(since consonant clusters do not occur word-finally, a schwa is inserted here − see
1.3.3).
       The inflectional ending -n is added to stems ending in either a vowel or a
consonant 104 , cf. gytga-n (< {gytga-n}) ‘late autumn’, nalgy-n (< {nalg-n}) ‘fur
skin’.
       The inflectional ending -lNyn is usually used with nouns denoting body parts
(both human and animal's), names of animals, and also with nouns denoting one
object of a pair, cf. vilu-lNyn ‘ear’, masvi-lNyn ‘animal's chest’, Higy-lNyn (< {Hig-
lNyn}) ‘wolf’, lili-lNyn ‘mitten’. After stems ending in a homorganic consonant the
inflectional ending -lNyn appears as -lyNyn (see 1.3.3.3), cf. aNar-lyNyn ‘star’.
       The inflectional ending -qal is used only with nouns denoting one object of a
pair, cf. pylak-qal (along with pylaky-lNyn) ‘fur boot’, lili-qal (along with lili-lNyn)
‘mitten’.
       The inflectional ending -Na is used with a few nouns that probably belong to
the original Alutor lexicon: ypa-Na ‘soup’, kuka-Na ‘pot’, mami-Na ‘fish drying
shed’, qura-Na ‘reindeer’, rara-Na ‘yurt, house’, ruru-Na ‘bed, sleeping place, titi-
Na ‘needle’, typa-Na ‘stone hammer’.
       Many original and some loan-words form the nominative singular by copying
(= reduplicating) the root morph. Such words belong to different semantic groups, cf.
anu-@an (< {anured}) ‘spring’, wiru-wir (< {wirured}) ‘(kind of) salmon’ (for
reduplication rules see 1.3.1).
       The ergative markers -a/-ta are distributed according to the final segment of a
stem: the variant -a is used with stems ending in a consonant or a schwa, while the
variant -ta is used with stems ending in a non-schwa vowel, cf. tyrg-a ‘meat, ERG’,
jIl-a (< {jIly-a}) ‘tongue, ERG’, , but gytka-ta ‘leg, ERG’.
       In the locative the inflectional ending -ki is characteristic of stems ending in N
(and sometimes in w), in other cases the ending -k or its phonological variant -kki are
used (the latter − after a stressed vowel), cf. lyqlaN-ki ‘winter, LOC’, rara-k ‘house,
ERG’, mimly-k ‘water, LOC’, but lylô-kki ‘eye, LOC’.
       The dative, as well as the lative (the latter can be treated historically as a double
case composed of the locative and dative items), has no variants.
       In the prolative the morph -gypyN is used with the stems ending in a single
consonant, while in other cases the morph -jpyN is used. If a stem ends in the vowel -
     104
          If a stem ends in a consonant, an epenthetic y is inserted to break up an illicit consonant
cluster (see 1.3.3.2).","[95, 96]"

      Auxiliary verbs are compatible with different mood values: (10a) exemplifies
the indicative, (10b) the optative, (10c) the conjunctive, and (10d) the potential.

            [22:32]2.1.5. Negative forms
Besides the positive verb forms described above, there are negative forms. Verbal
negation can be expressed by the following means:
       (1) combination of the negative particle with the regular finite form of the verb;
       (2) combination of the negative particle with the deverbal predicative (a-...ka);
       (3) combination of the negative particle with the analytical form derived from
the deverbal predicative;
       (4) the analytical form, derived from the negative analytical representation
(nuN-...-a/-ta);
       (5) circumfixes tymNi-... -a/-ta and a-...-kyl@in (the latter is identical to the
caritive adjective (see 2.2.2) marker. It is compatible with the negative particle).
       Now we will consider the negative forms in detail.
       Type (1) is found only for the desirable moods — optative and conjunctive. In
this case the negative (more precisely, the prohibitive) particle qytymmy 91 is used.
(i)   to       vitga         g-awwav-laN                vyly-NNy...

      And at once they went out on the shore... [22:28]
      91
       It is interesting to note that the negative particle qytymmy is also compatible with nouns,
cf. gymmy wiwnyN ty-t-awwavy-N, qytymmy korfa-N ‘I will arrive at Vyvenka rather than in
Korf’. However in general nouns are more often combined with the negative noun alval@in ‘not
that, another’ rather than with qytymmy, cf. gymnan ty-gita-tky-n qajunJunJu, alval@in
NavysqatpilJ ‘I look at the boy rather than at the girl.’

often used as the syllable nucleus to create well-formed syllables and to eliminate
illicit consonant clusters.
        However, in some other cases the schwa is unpredictable, because it is difficult
or even impossible to formulate more or less standard phonological rules defining
schwa epenthesis in the non-vocalized representation. In such situations the fact that a
schwa is pronounced in a given word can be explained only by the individual
property of a given morpheme. In other words, we think that in such cases y should be
considered an inherent constituent of the corresponding morpheme. Many roots and
affixes therefore contain the schwa in the underlying representation, cf. the root {ypa}
‘soup’ appearing in the following words: @ypôNa (< {ypa-Na})‘soup’, tynypatyn (<
{t-n-ypa-at-n}) ‘I cooked it’ 2 . We also treat some root-medial y that always appear
in one the same place in a morpheme as part of the corresponding underlying
representation, cf. tímkytym 3 ‘hummock’, gatímkylin ‘covered with hummocks’ (the
root {tymk}); tyHylyk ‘be ill’, gatHíllin ‘(s)he fell ill’ (the root {tHyl}), myt-jôn-myk
(< {myt-jat-myk}) ‘we (two) came’ (the prefix {myt} and the suffix {myk}). In other
words, we always include the schwa in the underlying representation in case is not
inserted by means of the standard rules listed below. On these grounds we consider
the schwa an independent phoneme of Alutor.
        Thus, schwas in Alutor words can be of two different origins: some y are part of
the underlying representation (“original” y), some appear only in the surface
representation, they are epenthesized by means of standard rules (“epenthetic” y). In
the phonetic transcription we write the vowel y in all positions, as all linguists
     2
        We treat the glottal stop in @ypANa as a segment epethesized before a word-initial vowel (a
situation similar to German, Arabic etc.). We can certainly choose another variant for the
underlying representation – without y, but with the initial @ , that is {*@pa}, but in this case the
second word would appear as *tynApavyn (< *ty-ny-@pa-vy-n < *{t-n-@pa-v-n}), because in
syllable-final position y@ changes into A (this alternation is typical for the conjunctive − see 1.3.6).
Since it is not the word we have in reality, we choose {ypa} as the underlying representation.

        The non-epenthetic vowels y coming from the underlying representation are underlined

2.3.3. Adjectival forms
The adjectival form of a noun is actually the result of a derivational process, when a
noun becomes an adjective. We distinguish between relative (REL), possessive
(POSS), habitive (HABIT) and caritive (CARIT) adjectives, see 2.2.2. From a
syntactic point of view an adjectival is used in the role of the genitive, sometimes the
ablative, which occur in other languages with case systems.","[102, 103]"
"3.1.4.1.2. NP incorporation
The head noun of a NP as the goal of incorporation can be marked with the
nominative or an oblique case. In case of a head noun in the nominative incorporation
is optional, while in case of a head noun in an oblique case incorporation is obligatory
(in other words, noun phrases marked with an oblique case cannot have free
modifiers).
       Different head noun modifiers can be the targets of NP incorporation. First,

p o l y p e r s o n a l conjugation the verb has two agreement slots: a prefix and a suffix
slot. Transitive verbs agree with the agentive and patientive arguments (referred to
below as A - a n d P - a r g u m e n t s ). Intransitive verbs agree with the sole core
argument 46 (referred to below as S - a r g u m e n t ). It is important that the S/A-
argument, i.e. the argument bearing the Principal hyperrole (see argumentation
below) is the main controller of agreement. In m o n o p e r s o n a l conjugation the verb
has only one agreement slot – the suffix slot controlled by the S/P-argument, i.e. the
argument bearing the Absolutive hyperrole. Furthermore there is a number of
i m p e r s o n a l forms that do not distinguish person values of core arguments.

The infinitive forms sentential complements of phasal verbs (with typical meanings
‘begin’ 94 , ‘continue’, ‘finish’). Phasal verbs inherit the transitivity / intransitivity
properties of subordinate verbs marked as the infinitive. In the context of an
intransitive embedded verb the main verb has an intransitive agreement pattern and
agrees with a noun marked with the nominative:(50) a. ...myty-lJgi=tgilivy-lqiv-la(-myk)                              tanJNy.sity-k!

          ...Well, that's enough. Stop running (after me)... [8:59]
       However, in the context of a transitive embedded verb the main verb gets a
transitive agreement pattern:

       Statistically the overwhelming number of infinitive textual occurences are governed by the
verb ‘begin’.","[77, 78, 79, 80]"

"1.3.9. Regular Contact Consonant Assimilations
Contact assimilation of consonants is a wide spread phenomenon not only in Alutor,
but also in its related languages − Chukchi and Koryak. Most Alutor assimilations are
regressive, but some are progressive. In Alutor assimilations take place only
intervocalicly (that is at a syllable boundary). In some cases an intervocalic position
appears after an epenthetic schwa has been inserted, for instance, gônmylin (< {ga-
tm-lin}) ‘(s)he killed him/her’. Most changes given below occur irrespective of a
morpheme boundary between the changing segment X and the context (but
assimilations are optional at a composite boundary). In order to simplify the formal
rules we omit here syllable and morpheme boundary markers. It should also be noted
that the dental t of a person-number verbal prefix is not assimilated at a morpheme
boundary before a root consonant (this information is also omitted in the rules), cf.
mytlô@utkyn (= {myt-la@u-tky-n}) ‘we see him/her/it’.
       The following types of assimilation occur in Alutor:
       1) partial assimilation of the dental t before nasals, namely:
       at a syllable boundary an obstruent dental t changes into the corresponding
nasal (of the same place of articulation) immediately before a nasal m, n, nJ, or N
(see also rule (19)), i.e.
(17) a. t ⇒ n / _m
       b. t ⇒ n / _n or _nJ
       c. t ⇒ n / _N
       Examples: gônmylin (< {ga-tm-lin(a)}) ‘(s)he is killed’, @akminnin (< {akmi-
t-ni-n}) ‘(s)he took him/her/it’, varônJnJaqu (< varan-nJaqu < {varat-nJaqu-∅}) ‘a
lot of people’, ganNôlin (< {ga-tNa-lin(a)}) ‘it grew’.
       2) complete assimilation of the dental t before sonorant dentalveolars, namely:
       at a syllable boundary an obstruent dental t changes into the corresponding
sonorant immediately before a sonorant dentalveolar 1, 1J, or r (see also rules (17)
and (19)), i.e.
(18) a. t ⇒ l / _l or _lJ
       b. t ⇒ r / _r
                                            30
       Examples: vitôllat (< {vit-at-la-t}) ‘they worked’, tírran (< {t-tra-n) ‘I tore
it’.
        3) contact dentalveolar palatalization, namely:
        at a syllable boundary a non-palatalized dentalveolar t, n, or l changes into its
palatalized correlate immediately before the corresponding palatalized
dentalalveolar s, nJ, or lJ respectively, i.e.
(19) a. t ⇒ s / _s
        b. n ⇒ nJ / _nJ
        c. l ⇒ lJ / _lJ
        Examples: @arôssityk (< {arat-sit-k}) ‘pour’, mytônJnJaqu (< {mtan-nJaqu})
‘big mosquito’, @ystãlJlJyqyk (< ystul-lJyqy-k < {ystul-lJq-k}) ‘on a table’.
        4) palatalization of the sonorant dentals n, l before the palatal j (here both
segments change), namely:
        at a syllable boundary a non-palatalized dental n or l together with the
following palatal j change into the corresponding geminated palatalized dental nJnJ
or lJlJ respectively, i.e.
(20) a. nj ⇒ nJnJ
        b. lj ⇒ lJlJ
        Examples: tínJnJun (< ty-nju-n < {t-nju-n}) ‘I guarded him/her/it’, tilJlJøta (<
{til-jita}) ‘by a wing’.
        5) complete assimilation of the nasal n before sonorant dentoalveolars, namely:
        at a syllable boundary a sonorant nasal n changes into the corresponding
sonorant dentalveolar immediately before a sonorant dentalveolar l or r, i.e.
(21) a. n ⇒ l / _l
        b. n ⇒ r / _r
        Examples (this assimilation is attested only for the medial variant of the
causative marker -n-): tyllóvyn (< {t-n-levy-n}) ‘I took him/her/it (with me)’,
tyrrItylavyn (< {t-n-rItyla-av-n}) ‘I saw him/her/it in (my) dream’.
        6) complete assimilation of the uvular q, namely:
        at a syllable boundary an obstruent uvular q changes into k when it is
immediately preceded by a velar k, i.e.
(22) q ⇒ k / _k
        Examples: tôkkin (< {taq-kin(a)}) ‘why’.
        7) complete progressive assimilation of the labial v , namely:
        at a syllable boundary an obstruent labial v changes into w immediately after a
labial w, i.e.
(23) v ⇒ w / w_
        Examples: tíwwak (< ty-wva-k < {t-gva-k}) ‘I stuck’.","[30, 31]"

2.1.7. The values of some verbal categories
2.1.7.1. Indicative
The indicative refers to the events belonging to the real world, i.e. events that took or
are taking place. Temporal deixis of respective forms is secondary. The perfective
usually describes events that took place before the speech act, see (27a). The
imperfective is neutral to the temporal axis. It can be used for events proceeding
during the speech act as well as prolonged incompleted events before the speech act,
see (27b):(27) a. wutt.in         itt-i             ynkyjap,        nJy.mqy.saN.ki.

          already began to snow} [29:8-10]
      The imperfective also describes prolonged events that continuously take place
or are repeated. Thus, texts 25-28, describing traditional customs, abound in
indicative imperfective forms, for example:(28)      jaqi       myty-lHita-lqivy-tkyn,               varanJ-nJaq

perfective marking, and the second one (‘carry’) — imperfective marking. This is
because the first action is punctual and the second is prolonged.
      In analytical negative forms relating to the temporal domain of the definite
future the auxiliary verb can have imperfective marking:(30) ...ally      a-pilg.at-ka             il-la-tkyni-tyk.

        not be (left) hungry. [11:10]2.1.7.2. Potential
Potential means that the event P does not belong to the world of real events,
nevertheless P can potentially be in this world. This event does not have any
epistemic restrictions. It is quite natural that this type of event is closely related to
events that, in languages with the grammatical category of tense, pertain to future.
Therefore in most cases potential verb forms are translated as future forms:(31)     vitga           lygyrNy-n                  ga-kumn.al-lin:

         [22:20]2.1.7.3. Optative
The optative, like the conjunctive, pertains to moods that refer to the mental state of
the speaker. The prototypical properties of the optative are the following:
      — the speaker is thinking about a virtual event P;
                                               72
      — the speaker wants event P to be performed;
      — the speaker highly estimates the reality of the approach of the event P;
      — the speaker is talking about this.
      The speaker's capability to control the approach of event P depends on the
person of the active participant (actor) of this event.
      In the context of the 1sg actor (identical to the speaker) the optative, along with
the speaker/actor's wish for the performance of event P, refers to his intention or wish
to accomplish it:(32)      maja?         my-n.sis@aty-n.
          where         1sg.A+OPT-look-3sg.P

          Sit down, (that's) enough, I will carry you on (my) back. [4:9]      The usage of the 1pl optative is analogous: the optative refers to the speaker's
intention to perform an action and his address to the listener to do this together with
him:(35) a. ...myn-meNy=tkyply-la-n,                      myn-Halap-la-n.

          Qutkinnaqu, maybe we will go (and) visit (my) home. [7:24]       c. nuN-alu-sqiv-a                      myn-ity-tkyn.
          NEG-pick.berries-go-ANLT            1nsg.S+OPT-be-IPF
          We won't have to go picking berries. [7:18]
      It the context of a 3rd person S/A-argument, the optative refers to the speaker's
wish that the event in question happens to that 3rd person:(36)      qygi       taqy=trup=kiwyl                          ny-@-ity-n,
          look!      what=Teruppe=blood+NOM+SG                3.S+OPT-be-3sg.S

          this+3sg      my+3sg        nostril=blood+NOM+SG
          {LC:     hy is this blood bad? , said Miti.} You see, it would be good if this were
          Teruppe's blood, but this is blood from my nose. [10:29]
      This example convincingly testifies to the failure of an imperative interpretation
of these forms in the 3rd person. In the context of the 3rd person, the subject of the
wish does not have to coincide with the speaker.(37)      a-Neqy-ka            wut¥ku tig-uwwi                     ny-tkiv-na(-wwi).

          It's bad if the skis spend the night here. [12:6]In the dialogue the speaker (the man) presupposes that the hearer (the bear) wishes
the skis had stayed home at night.","[70, 71, 72, 73, 74]"
"2.4. Pronouns
2.4.1. Personal pronouns
Free personal pronouns for the 1st, 2nd and 3rd person, singular, dual and plural,
occur in Alutor. The 3rd person singular does not distinguish between either human/
non-human or animate/ non-animate. Substantivized demonstratives are also used as
3rd person pronouns (see below).
       Dual and plural pronouns are derived from one and the same stem and differ
only in the nominative and sometimes in the ergative, in other oblique cases one and
the same form is used for each case (in the ergative the difference between the dual
and plural can be marked through verbal agreement). Thus, there are 9 pronouns, but
only 6 pronominal stems: {gym} ‘I’ (NOM gymmy), {gyt} ‘you (sg)’ (NOM gytty),
{yn-/y-} 110 ‘(s)he/it’ (NOM ynnu), {mur} ‘we’ (NOM muri ‘we two’, NOM
muru(wwi) ‘we’), {tur} ‘you (nsg)’ (NOM turi ‘you two’, NOM turu(wwi) ‘you
(pl)’)’, {yt} ‘they’ (NOM ytti ‘they two’, NOM ytuwwi ‘they’).
       Personal pronouns have much in common with nominal forms of the noun: they
are used in the same syntactic positions and are marked for case. But, unlike nouns,
personal pronouns are not incorporated, they are used only as autonomous words.
Adjectives derived from pronominal stems and similar to adjectival forms of the noun
belong to another group of pronouns − possessive pronouns.
       Alutor personal pronouns have approximately the same set of cases as nouns.
10 cases are distinguished: n o m i t a t i v e , e r g a t i v e , l o c a t i v e , d a t i v e ,
prolative, contactive, causal, equative, comitative, associative.
As for the Lative, its pronominal form is likely to coincide with the dative form, so it
is not represented in the list of cases.
       There is some divergence from the case system of nouns as regards the
realization of different cases.
       The nominative singular is marked with a zero morph; in the 1st and 2nd person     110
           The morph y- is usually used before markers beginning with n-.",[104]
"3.1.4.1.1. VP incorporation
Incorporation of the P-argument is most widespread. In this case the verb usually
becomes intransitive, while its initial A-argument becomes the S-argument:(15) a. am-mis@a-s@y-n                                  it@y-n

            They were dressed in the most beautiful fur coats and were going around the house.
    [6:9]     b. keNy-n                  ga-tylly=n.waNtal-lin             Nan.in=Hujamtawil@y-N.
            bear-NOM+SG         RES-door=open-RES+3sg.S           that=man-DAT
            The bear opened the door of the person's (house) [= to that person]. [12:1]      In (15a) the transitive verb ‘go around’ becomes intransitive and agrees in non-
singular with the contextually retrievable S-argument ‘dogs’. In (15b) there is an
overt S-argument keNyn ‘bear’ of the intransitivized verb ‘open’. The benefactive
preserves its marking as a peripheral argument. However, it is not obligatory. In the
context of patient incorporation a benefactive can be promoted to the nominative
position, transitivity of the verb being preserved:     123
       Such insight on incorporation is widely presented in the works on Chukotko-Kamchatkan
languages, cf. [Skorik 1948; 1977; Zhukova 1953; 1972; Muravyova 1989b; 1990b].",[118]
"2.4.4. Interrogative pronouns
The following two interrogative nouns are used in Alutor: {taq} ‘what’ ( tinga ‘what,
NOM+SG’) and {mik} ‘who’ (migga ‘who, NOM+SG’). They are used very much
like nouns. The pronoun ‘what’ is declined as a word of the 1st declension, and the
pronoun ‘who’ − as a word of the 2nd declension. The pronoun ‘what’ is used not
only in the singular, but also in the plural (cf. taq-uwwi ‘what, NOM+PL’ [17:13]).
      Being used predicatively, these pronouns agree with their S-actant (which can
be omitted) in person and number:(84)         mik-igyt?
             who-2sg
             Who are you? [5:12]       When the pronoun {taq} ‘what’ is used attributively in the underlying structure,
it is obligatorily incorporated; in this case it means ‘what; what kind of’ 114 . Compare:(85)         taq=Nav.@an-igyt?
             what=wife-2sg
             (It's not important) whose wife you are. [13:10]      A pronoun similar to the adjectival form is found only for the pronoun ‘who’ −
it is the possessive pronoun mik.in(a)- ‘whose’ 115 . It is used like any other
possessive adjective marked with -in(a) and it may be substantivized like any other
pronominal adjective.",[109]
"At the same time, it is important to note that in Alutor there are s y n t a c t i c contexts
favoring the antipassive. Thus in a relative clause the deleted coreferential NP should
be marked with the nominative. If in a primary diathesis this NP is marked with an
oblique case, antipassivization is necessary:(13) ...to       ikav      Nan.in        t.ilu-l@aty-tky-ni-n

      Only my friends, those who were watching over the exit, {RC: they ended up spearing each
      other.} [21:108]       In (13) the verb t/n.pynkyt.at- is the causative from the verb pynkyt- ‘get
stuck’, it has the government pattern <smb.: E; smth.: N; in smth.: L>. In the primary
structure of the relative clause the coreferential NP ‘enemy’ takes the locative form,
therefore antipassivization takes place. In (14) the relativized NP ‘friends’ is marked
in its primary diathesis with the ergative, so the antipassive is used.
       The usage of the antipassive has not been exhaustively investigated. It is
relatively rare in the texts, however the tendency for the syntactic usage of the
nominative is attested, i.e. the tendency towards syntactic ergativity in Alutor; see
[Kibrik 1979].",[117]

"1.1.2.3. Sonorants
Among the sonorants the most numerous group is the nasals; here we find the labial
m, two dentals – the non-palatalized n and the palatalized nJ, and the velar N.
      Laterals are represented by the non-palatalized l and the palatalized lJ.
      The palatalized dentals nJ and lJ belong to the same place of articulation as their
non-palatalized correlates l and n. The non-palatalized dentals t, n and l, like all other
non-palatalized sounds, are not velarized 16 , that is why they do not velarise the
following front vowels. It should be also noted that the opposition n/nJ, l/lJ is not
neutralized before the front vowels, so both variants − a palatalized and a non-
palatalized one − occur there (cf. kôlik ‘write’ vs. kalJøsityk ‘write (repeatedly)’).
      The remainder of the sonorants do not require special comment. The consonants
     13
         That is why in Russian borrowings the Russian fricative x changes into the Alutor q, cf.
qylJøppy ‘bread’ (from the Russian xl’eb), @ãrvaq ‘shirt, dress’ (from the Russian rubáxa), &kolqos
‘collective farm’ (from the Russian kolxóz).
      14
         In the Koryak language [Zhukova 1972] the corresponding phoneme is realised as the
fricative pharyngeal and is written in the transcription as h.
      15
         The initial Alutor @ corresponds to the Koryak laryngeal @, while the non-initial Alutor @
and H (the latter – both initially and non-initially) correspond to the Koryak pharyngeal fricative
H, cf. the corresponding Koryak words jãHyk ‘reach’, vøHyk ‘die’.
      16
         Actually, sometimes there occurs a velarized variant of l (we often transcribed this sound
as w, not as l), but this may be due to the influence of the Russian language, where l is strongly
velarized.",[10]

marked with the ergative and controls the prefix agreement slot in polypersonal
conjugation; the P-argument is marked with the nominative and controls the suffix
agreement slot in polypersonal conjugation. In monopersonal conjugation agreement
is controlled by the P-argument.
       I n t r a n s i t i v e verbs have one core S-argument marked with the nominative
that controls the suffix agreement slot in monopersonal conjugation and both
agreement slots in polypersonal conjugation.
       From the point of view of case marking Alutor uses the e r g a t i v e
alignment 117 , unifying the S/P-arguments (with the Absolutive hyperrole) and
opposing them to the A-argument. Monopersonal conjugation is analogous (the
Absolutive is the agreement controller). An interpretation of polypersonal conjugation
is more controversial. Namely, the S-, A- and P-arguments use different sets of
controlled agreement slots: The S-arguments control the prefix as well as suffix slots,
the A-arguments control the prefix slots and the P-arguments control the suffix slots.
Therefore, from the point of view of polypersonal conjugation the t r i p a r t i t e
alignment is realized. From the point of view of the marker's material form, the prefix
markers bring the A- and S-arguments in line with t h e a c c u s a t i v e alignment
(with the Principal hyperrole), opposing them to the P-argument; see 2.1.1.2.
       In the suffix slots the sets of S- and P-markers are different, therefore the suffix
slot realizes the tripartite alignment opposing the S/A/P-arguments.
       In Alutor there are different means of including a verb's arguments into the set
of core arguments as well as excluding them from the set of core arguments. The first
process is called i n c r e a s e , and the second one d e c r e a s e of their syntactic status.
These processes often take place simultaneously as the status of some argument
increases while the status of another one decreases.
       From the point of view of the increase/decrease of the syntactic status, the
nominative position is the most important. This position is always present in a clause
(it can lack material form in the context of ambient verbs or in case of ellipsis). It is
the target of all increasing processes. Therefore, the Absolutive hyperrole can
correspond to different primary semantic roles. In contrast to the nominative position,
the ergative position is stable from the point of view of its role identification: it
merges the agent and experiencer in the Agentive hyperrole. Almost always, it is the
initial position of the government pattern of the respective verb 118 . The only exception
     117
         For a more detailed discussion of the typology of syntactic constructions and the
corresponding hyperroles see [Kibrik 1997a].
     118
         This position can be added in the case of causativization, however in this case it is a
derivational process producing a new lexeme rather that a diathesis change.","[110, 111]"
"1.2. Syllable and Rhythmic structure
1.2.1. Syllable Structure
Alutor imposes strict conditions on syllable structure, and the notion of syllable is
essential for the phonological pattern of the Alutor language.
        If we consider the main classes of sounds − consonants and vowels − the
canonical syllable patterns will be |CV| and |CVC| (the symbol “ | ” indicates a
syllable boundary). These patterns have only one constraint: if the nucleus of a
syllable is a long vowel, the syllable has no coda. Thus, in reality we find the
following syllable patterns: |Cy|, |СVshort|, |CVlong|, |CyC|, |СVshortC| (here V is a non-
schwa vowel), cf. |vi|tô|tyk| ‘work’, |tøl|my|til| ‘eagle’, |@øt|@yn| ‘fur coat’, |@a|lô|@al|
‘summer’, |jØ|ly|jil| ‘tongue’, |wi|rã|wir| ‘(kind of) salmon’, |ja|tít|kyn| ‘(s)he is
coming’.
        The set of syllable patterns given above is valid only if we consider a careful,
distinct pronunciation, which we will call the standard pronunciation. In fluent speech
native speakers may often elide the schwa in a two or three consonant cluster (one of
the consonants is usually a sonorant), so there may appear some consonant clusters,
illicit in the standard pronunciation. Thus, we often find optional words pronounced
of other syllable types, such as |CCV| and |CCVC|, cf. qylôvul ~ qlôvul ‘husband’,
@ínkyjap ~ @ínkjap ‘long ago’ 17 . In the present paper we prefer to deal only with the
standard pronunciation.
        Word boundaries in Alutor always coincide with syllable boundaries, for
instance, @ógyv|#@arNønati (not *@ógy|v#ar|Nønati) ‘It rained yesterday’.
        In reduplications the boundary between the two root morphs also coincides with
the syllable boundary, cf. @ønmy|@in (< {inm=in}) ( not *@in|min) ‘gulp’. The same is
true with incorporations and productive compounds, but only if the second stem
begins with a vowel, cf. mis@ô=@it@yl@yn (< {mis@a=it-l@-n}) ‘the one in a beautiful
fur coat’, sasø=@ilNatgyrNyn (< {sasi=ilN-at-gyrN-n}) ‘watchstrap’. In some
compounds there is no glottal stop before an initial vowel of the second stem, and the
syllable begins with a preceding consonant, cf. tig-ølNyn (< {tig-ilN-N}) ‘ski strap’.",[12]
"1.1.2.2. Obstruents
The obstruents are subdivided into two classes: plosives and fricatives. In Alutor all
the plosives are voiceless, and all the fricatives are voiced. The Alutor fricatives have
a rather broad passageway, so they are similar to sonorants. Fricatives are represented
by only two segments − v and g. It is remarkable that while Alutor fricative obstruents
                                                   8
are not numerous, there is great variety to the sonorants. 9
       Alutor obstruents occur at all the places of articulation, except for the absence
of palatals.
       Labials are represented by the two consonants − p and v.
       Dentalveolars (both obstruents and sonorants) are represented by the dentals t,
n, l and the alveolar r. The dentals contrast in secondary articulation − palatalization;
they may be either non-palatalized or palatalized. The non-palatalized dental t does
not have a voiced fricative correlate 10 . The exact palatalized correlate of t would be tJ,
but this is not the sound we usually find in Alutor (actually, the sound tJ does occur,
but only in some Alutor words, cf. matka ~ matJka ‘interrogative particle’). The
sound we consider the palatalized correlate of t is represented mainly by two variants,
both close to the palatalized tJ, but not identical with it: the affricate tsJ and the
fricative sJ, the latter similar to a palatal fricative. The affricate occurs mainly in the
speech of the old generation, while the fricative is more widely used, it occurs in the
speech of young and middle-aged people. In papers on Alutor the fricative sound is
usually registered as s; in the present paper we also use s to write this sound in the
practical transcription. It is remarkable that the morphological alternation t/tsJ occurs
approximately in the same contexts as the alternations 1/1J, n/nJ (see 1.3.10). On
these grounds we refer to tsJ as the palatalized correlate of t. The phoneme tsJ has no
voiced counterpart 11 .
       Velars are represented by the plosive k and the fricative g. The fricative is
rather close to the sonorants, it often sounds very much like the labial velar w 12 . It is
remarkable that g changes into w syllable-finally (see 1.3.5).
       Uvulars are represented by the plosive q, which is slightly pharyngealized. In     9
         It is possible that the Alutor system is changing from a system with two classes of
obstruents − plosives and fricatives, to a system with one class of plosives. That is just how the
Koryak consonants are often described (see [Trubetskoy 1958, Zhukova 1972]): all non-plosives
are treated as sonorants. But there are some typological facts that should be taken into
consideration: first, two labial non-nasal sounds are not common in the class of sonorants; second,
if g were a sonorant, we would have its vocalic correlate – a high back non-rounded vowel, but
there is no such vowel in the Alutor system. That is why we prefer to describe the Alutor system
as contrasting between plosives and fricatives. Cf. also the reconstruction proposed in [Mudrak
2000].
      10
          The corresponding phoneme is reconstructed for the Chukchi-Koryak protolanguage
[Muravyova 1986a]: in Alutor it coincided with t, in Koryak − with j/č, in Chukchi − with r, cf.
Alutor tiNak − Koryak jiNek − Chukchi riNek ‘fly’.
      11
          Even if there had been such a sound in the proto-Alutor language, it is likely to have
coincided with the palatal j.
      12
         Such a sound exists, for example, in the Polish language.","[8, 9]"
