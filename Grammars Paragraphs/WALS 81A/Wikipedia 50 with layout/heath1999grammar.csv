16 2 Overview     Third, KCh and DjCh show S-MAN-V-X constituent order (subject, mood-aspect-
negation, verb, other elements including direct object), while KS, HS, and the non-
Malian varieties show S-MAN-O-V-X order with the direct object preceding the verb.
In Greenbergian terms, Western Songhay is SVO while the other varieties are SOV,
though the latter are not verb-final languages in the fashion of Turkish and Japanese.
The SOV Songhay varieties also show a Transitive marker between the MAN complex
and a direct object NP (if present); there is no trace of this in KCh or DjCh.
     KCh and DjCh share Def di and PI yo in NPs. (These are also found in the Bamba
dialect of KS.) Mainstream KS and most other Songhay languages have different
DefSg and DefPl suffixes.
     DjCh differs from KCh on many counts. DjCh has seven phonemic vowel
qualities to five for KCh. DjCh favors in situ relativization and WH-interrogatives,
while KCh fronts the relative pronoun and the WH-interrogatives. Because of the many
lexical differences between DjCh and KCh, it is necessary to devote separate
dictionaries to them. For more details on DjCh grammar, see Appendix 2.","[31, 32]"

6.3 Compounds6.3.1 Noun-verb compoundsNoun-verb compounds are rare, but they are easy to spot on grounds of word order (N-
V) and semantic skewing. The examples I know of are in (214). The compounds
function syntactically as verbs.",[154]
"
5.9 Adpositions and case-marking
5.9.1 Unmarked case versus adpositionsThe distinction between subject and direct object is expressed by constituent order.
Subject NPs precede MAN morphemes and the verb, which is followed by direct
objects and PPs. When a direct object is fronted in the focalization construction it
precedes the subject NP and is normally followed by Foe morpheme na. Although
subject and direct-object NPs lack case markers, there is rarely any difficulty in
identifying these case functions. (135) is a simple transitive example.(135)         [har    di^]      o      guna      [woy        di]
              [man    Def]      Impf   see       [woman      Def]
              'The man sees the woman.'",[119]

5.3.2 Sequences of adjectivesSome examples of adjective sequences are given in (102). The literal glosses retain the
word order of the original.

           f.   derbe ciina tey-nte              'shirt little wet'    Judging from the variable location of the size adjectives beer 'big', keyna 'small',
and ciina 'small', it does not appear that the order of adjectives is rigidly
grammaticalized.","[103, 104]"
"
8.1.2 Subject focus constructionsThe na construction (preceding section) is used for focus on any NP, PP, or adverbial
that would ordinarily follow the verb. This includes all NPs other than the subject,
which alone of basic arguments always precedes the verb. When the subject NP is
focused, simple fronting of this NP (leaving a coindexed trace) would be string-
vacuous, (28la) being converted into (28Ib):(281)        a.   [NP] - MAN morphemes - verb - ...
             b.   [NP], - tx - MAN morphemes - verb    If the Foe morpheme na were added to (28Ib) in order to differentiate the subject-
focus construction (28Ib) from the simple (28la), there would be a serious risk of
ambiguity, since na is also the (perfective) Neg morpheme. A subject-focus
construction (282a), with null MAN marking (indicative perfective positive) would be
homophonous with a simple Neg sentence (282b).(282)        a.   [NP]X - na - tx - (null MAN marking) - verb -...
             b.   [NP] - na - verb -...
172 8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativization    Whether or not such language-specific functional considerations played the role of
evolutionary filter, preventing (28Ib) or (282a) from becoming established as the basic
subject-focus construction, Koyra Chiina has a quite different construction (283).","[187, 188]"

4.1.4 Subject and Object forms of pronominalsThe simplest type of NP is a bare personal pronoun. The basic forms are shown in
(58); variants and irregular allomorphs are commented on below.(58)    personal pronouns (S=subject, O=object)

§3.8.1-2. For numerous additional variants of rjgi-yoandrjgu-yo, see §3.8.8.
     (58) shows distinct subject and object forms for the ISg, 3Sg, and 3P1. The other
pronouns have a single, invariant form (shown in a central S=O column between the
S-only and O-only columns). In the case of ISg, the orthographic distinction reflects
what is arguably a subphonemic positional variation in the pronunciation of the
diphthong nucleus (§3.3.1). The only real subject-object variation is therefore in the
""3"" category, where the object form (which directly follows the verb) is 3Sg ga or 3P1
gi (sometimes palatalized to ji, §3.6.4). Some examples of the ISg, 3Sg, and 3P1 are
given in (59); the syntactic order is subject + verb + object as in English.","[73, 74]"
"
11.3 Perception     Perception predicates, as in English, have a subject NP representing the perceiver
and a direct object representing the perceived object or its sensory emanation. The
primary verbs, all transitive, are given in (710). mom normally means 'hear, listen,
understand (words, language)', but has the sense 'smell' in connection with an object
like hew 'wind, air, odor'. The verb maata is a more abstract stem meaning 'become
aware of, through unspecified sensory channels.
                                                   11.4 Emotion and personality        367(710)         verb          gloss

              mom           'hear, listen, understand (words); smell (odor); notice'
              mani          'smell (odor)'
              taba          'taste'      We might also mention bey 'know, notice, recognize', korosi 'notice', taameysa
'notice (as distinguishing sign of object)', honno 'catch sight of, espy (from afar)', and
700 'look back' [intr].
      Percept nouns include hew in the sense 'odor' and tembe 'taste'. Representative
phrases are a si mey tembe 'it has no taste' and a tembe di ci muso foo ? 'its taste
is like what?' For '(characteristic) voice or sound (of an entity)' the usual term is jinde
(core sense: 'neck').","[382, 383]"
"      Here there are not one but two pronominal postverbal constituents, direct object
ga and Dat war se. We may consider this to be an enclitic string, attached as a whole
to the verb bar. In such cases, the direct object enclitic obligatorily precedes any
cliticized PP.
      The cliticization analysis is useful in accounting for pronominal morphology as
well as constituent order. In (438) we have an instance of 3SgO ga, which differs in
form from a short 3Sg allomorph a. The longer ga is used in direct object function, in
which case it immediately follows the verb (for a 'give' construction with two such
object clitics, see the following section), ga is also the 3Sg form following the
preposition nda 'and, with'. The a variant is used in other functions including subject,
possessor of NP, and object of postposition. The 3P1 variants gi and i follow the same
pattern (§4.1.1). We could argue that the gV variants are required when the third person
pronominal is a) enclitic (to a verb or ndä), and b) is not bracketed with another
following morpheme (i.e., a postposition).
      Alternatively, we could limit enclitic status to direct-object pronouns, in which
case condition (b) could be dispensed with since PPs would not be covered. But a good
case can be made for taking certain pronominal PPs as clitics. First, the ordering of
pronominal PPs before nonpronominal complements, as in (437), seems to be
obligatory with certain postpositions; the rare counterexamples in texts probably
reflect clause-internal repairs and are not confirmed in elicitation. Second, irregular
forms for the ISg and 2Sg dative combinations, used only in postverbal position, are
best analysed as special enclitic forms. Consider (439).(439)    a.   a-a           jafa      yene         alhoor di
              3SgS-Impf carve         ISgDat limestone Def
              'He cuts the limestone for me.'
         b.   ay         bar      ga      mana
              ISgS       say      3SgO 2SgDat
              'Isaid it to you.'

              [2S g Dat] Foe ISgS say 3SgO
              'It was [to you] [focus] that I said it.'",[260]
"    The semantic scope appears to be over the following: the NP 'the people's
exaggeration' (392a), the instrumental phrase 'by yourself (392b), the NP
complement of the PP or perhaps (in spite of the syntax) the PP as a whole (392c,i),
222 8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativizationthe verb 'hear' excluding its clausal complement (392d), the matrix verb 'seek'
excluding its subjunctive complement (392e), the VP 'it comes to you' (392f), 'sits'
either as verb or as one-word VP (392g). In (392h), one could argue that Only' has a
higher-order pragmatic scope; in context we may expand the relevant portion as 'the
only consequence of your using a mixture of cheap odd-shaped limestone pieces and
mud-and-gravel cement, and of someone else's using expensive rectangular limestone
blocks, is that his house will have perfectly flat walls, while yours will be irregular.'
     In these examples, nin translates easily as Only' (or a near-synonym like
'merely', 'simply', 'just'). In some other textual examples, like (393), such a
translation would be forced.(393)         nda boro fatta [haya se] nin,
              if     person exit [thing Dat] only,

5.2.2 Recursive possessionRecursion occurs when the first-order possessor NP itself contains a (second-order)
possessor. A simple example is (96).(96)          [[ay]       baaba        wane]       huu        di
              [[ISg]     father        Poss]       house      Def
              'my father's house'    When cumbersome full NPs are involved, such constructions become difficult to
process, but there is no syntactic restriction on them, as seen in (97).(97)    a.    [[har     di       wane] huu          di     wane] sooro    di
              [[man     Def Poss] house Def                Poss] upstairs Def
              'the upstairs of the man's house'
        b.    [[war        wane]        faaba-öere         di]  addeliil   di
              [[2P1       Poss]         help-friend        Def] motive     Def
              'the motive of your mutual help'
        c.    [[qgi-ye      ta]       tun           di]      alwakati      di
              [[3P1F        Top]      arising       Def]     time          Def
              'the time of their arising'
86 5 Nominal inflection and NP syntax     These examples show various combinations of presence or absence of postposition
wane. We get wane after both possessors in (97a), after the rightmost only in (96),
after the leftmost only in (97b), and after neither in (97c).","[101, 102]"
"
3.9.2 Stress, incorporation (tight compounding), and cliticizationStress is nonphonemic, with neither lexical nor grammatical significance, in the
analysis and transcription used here. In a few cases, an unusual phonetic stress
                                             3.10 Historical phonological notes     49placement may be a surface indicator of vowel length in a position (before a consonant
cluster) where duration is an unreliable surface cue; see §3.7.9.
     As in many languages, multisyllabic words tend to have reduced phonetic stress
(intensity, pitch, vocalic duration, etc.) on final syllables, especially CV syllables.
Even stem-final CVV syllables in nonmonosyllabic words tend to be heard as
unstressed short-voweled phonetic [CV] when prepausal or at the end of syntactic
phrases, so the length of final vowels is best determined by adding a grammatical
formative, e.g. Def di in the case of nouns. The lack of intrinsic stress on final
syllables allows speakers to use final syllables to express higher-level intonational
patterns (e.g. rising pitch marking interrogation or a desire to keep the floor).
     Many grammatical morphemes, though transcribed as separate words, are regularly
unstressed and tend to pattern as proclitics or enclitics to nouns, verbs, and other
lexical stems. We do not emphasize this issue here since the phonological
consequences are usually nonexistent or subtle. For that matter, there are no
completely reliable phonetic indices of affixation or incorporation (tight compounding,
§4.6), as opposed to word sequencing, and our decisions about which morpheme
sequences to recognize as single-word compounds and which to separate
transcriptionally are based largely on semantic lexicalization and morphosyntactic
patterning.
     The best case for cliticization as a formal feature of the grammar involves
postverbal pronominal objects and pronominal PPs. These elements normally
immediately follow the verb, preceding other postverbal constituents that involve full
(noun-headed) NPs (§9.1.1). The dative forms of two pronouns, ISg and 2Sg, also
show special forms in this postverbal position, as opposed to the regular forms they
have in fronted (focalized, preverbal) position (§3.8.1-2).","[64, 65]"
"     The parsing of Xna ci Υ nono is tricky. One possibility is to take is as a single
clause, with ci as the basic verb and nono as a kind of redundant, nonclausal
supplement. However, we could alternatively parse it as a na ci [Y nono], glossable
as 'it is not the case (that) [it is (a) Y].' This is because a na δϊ commonly functions
as a higher-order negation with a complete proposition as its complement (§9.3.2).
     Sixth, discourse-functional (DF) morphemes like moo 'also, moreover', and the
quantifier kul, can be added to Y nono either after the NP (Y) or after the nono,
apparently with different scope readings. (232) shows the ""Y"" constituent with weak
Top ta, which in ordinary sentences is most typical of subject NPs and preposed
topical constituents (§8.4.3). In (233a), moo in the sense 'moreover' has scope over
and follows the entire equational clause addabba ye nono. However, in (233b),
which follows immediately on (232) in the relevant text, moo takes narrow scope over
and immediately follows the ""Y"" NPjinni 'djinn, genie', and so precedes nono.(233)    a.    addabba ye nono moo kaa,

(132b), weak Emph yaa in (132c), and Emph daa in (132d). The ordering of discourse-
function morphemes before postpositions appears to be fixed syntactically rather than
semantically. There is a logically possible scope difference between, say, Only [in [its
first part]]' and 'in [only [its first part]]', but in practice the semantic difference is
slight and a syntactic fixing of the order does not cause communicative problems.(133)          maa se [mobil ressort nin] na wor o                    faas/?

as being restricted by nin Only'. For maa se in this example, see discussion of (307a-
c) in §8.2.3.",[118]

5.11.1 Conjunction of personal pronounsThat the pattern X [nda Ύ] 'X and Y' is asymmetrical even when X (left conjunct) and
Υ (right conjunct) are of the same syntactic type is most clearly seen by studying the
forms they take when X and Υ are personal pronouns. There is a standardized ordering
of the pronoun categories along a (grammaticalized) topicality hierarchy, and certain
pronominal categories take different forms as left and as right conjuncts.
     The ordering of categories normally follows the hierarchy in (157), as seen in
(158). Counterexamples with ordering inverted occasionally occur in direct elicitation,
probably reflecting interference from French cues, but are unidiomatic and do not occur
in texts. Simple 3Sg or 3P1 pronouns never occur as left conjuncts since this is an
""exposed"" syntactic position forcing replacement of (unmarked) 3Sg by 3SgF and of
3P1 by 3P1F (§8.4.2).",[129]
"     The stems in (697d) involve vertical motion and stance. The most interesting is
tun 'get up, stand up, arise', since in narratives it can be used in a way best translated
freely as 'get up and go' or 'set off. The point is that in general one arises from
sitting or prone position in order to go somewhere, and this implication is more
systematically exploited in KCh than in English.
      No special comments are needed on the other stems in (697d), on the verbs of
straight or circular motion in (697e), or on the verbs of mode of propulsion in (697f).",[377]
"
8.6.7 Subjunctive mood and focusSubjunctive clauses tend to be less ""vivid"" than main clauses, since they typically
denote hypothetical event types. Overt focalization is uncommon in subjunctive
clauses. However, textual examples of nonsubject focus (436a) and subject focus
(436b-c) do occur, and there is clearly no syntactic restriction on them.

                  Sentence-level syntax and semantics
9.1 Object NPs and other postverbalconstituents9.1.1 Ordering and cliticization of postverbal constituentsThe ordering of postverbal constituents is basically determined by two main factors.
First, certain types of constituents must occur at or near the end of the clause. This
applies most rigorously to DF morphemes with clausal scope, where clause-final
positioning is obligatory. However, even full phrasal constituents may gravitate
toward the end of the clause, either because they are semantically peripheral or because
they represent afterthought-like elaborations of referents which are represented earlier in
the sentence. Moreover, ""heavy"" constituents that might otherwise occur closer to the
verb may be shifted (extraposed) to clause-final position.
     The second generalization is that, after hiving off these clause-final elements, the
remaining phrasal constituents are normally ordered in such a way that
pronominalized, ""old,"" or otherwise backgrounded referential material occurs in

                                   Introduction
1.1 Generalities about SonghaySonghay is often described loosely as a ""language,"" but in fact it is a large complex of
varieties, some of which are quite clearly distinct languages. Languages of the
Songhay family are linguistically dominant in northeastern Mali along the Niger
River, and others of the family occupy much of the Republic of Niger (""Kaado"" and
""Zarma""). Additional varieties are spoken in Bonin, and perhaps still residually in the
Dori area of Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta). Some ""nomadic"" or ""northern""
Songhay languages, not yet well studied, are spoken by small beduin groups in far
northern Niger, with one offshoot each extending into Mali ('Tadaksahak"" near
Menaka) and in southwestern Algeria (""Korandje"" in the Tabelbala oasis). The major
work on the internal genetic classification of Songhay varieties is that of Nicola'i
(1981), who puts considerable emphasis on sound changes and phonological typology.
     My work on Songhay has focused to date on the four main varieties spoken in
Mali. The following sets of designations are partially interchangeable. One set
consists of transcriptions of the native terms; the second is simply the name (in
English or French) of the respective major town; the third is the cardinal-direction
system developed by Nicola'i.        native term         major city or town    NicolaTs term

         koroboro senn-i    Gao                   eastern Songhay (S. oriental)
         humburi senn-i     Hombori               central Songhay (S. central)     For Gao, koroboro senn-i co-occurs with other variants such as koyra senn-i and
koyra senn-e.
     The nouns ciini and senn-i ~ senn-i (with variant senn-e ~ senn-e) are noncognate,
though both mean 'speech, speaking, language', cf. verbs cii (<*ciin) and selaq -
seien. In the cases of Djenne and Hombori, both of which are (in effect) Songhay
enclaves rather than parts of extended Songhay-speaking regions, the first term of the
compound is simply the name of the town. Timbuktu and Gao, on the other hand, are
merely the largest cities in extended Songhay-speaking regions, and the terms for these
varieties are more general: koyra-ciini 'town language' and koroboro-senn-i
(contraction of koyra-boro senn-i 'town-person language') distinguish the sedentary
Songhays from the nomadic Arabs and Tuaregs. The Songhay are also sometimes
called 'river people' (Timbuktu isa-boro), but no related expression for their language
is in common use.
     For the native sense of sonoy, see beginning of §1.2.
     We will use the informal transcription ""Koyra Chiini"" to denote the unbroken
koyra ciini complex of dialects in the region along and near the Niger River beginning
2   1 Introduction with Timbuktu. This includes the towns of Dire"", Tonka, Goundam, and Niafunke
 going upriver (west) from Timbuktu. There is a thinly populated northern extension in
 Araouane, on the caravan route from Timbuktu to Taoudenni. There is a relatively
 sharp linguistic break between Koyra Chiini and Koroboro Senni (the ""Gao"" variety)
just east of Timbuktu. Koroboro Senni is the traditional language even of Gourma
 Rharous and Bamba, the first important towns on the Niger River going east from
Timbuktu.
      Most of my Koyra Chiini data are from Timbuktu itself. I have a corpus of some
 six hours of transcribed recordings, mostly dyadic (interviews, conversations, or
 narratives with an interactive listener). I have supplemented this data base with elicited
material obtained chiefly in the final field sessions (1996-97).
      I also have some transcribed recordings from Niafunke"" and Goundam, which can
 serve as representatives of the larger complex of ""upriver"" dialects (""upriver"" from the
perspective of Timbuktu). I also spent about a week in this area in 1996 to clear up
 some problems in the analysis of these tapes and to do some follow-up elicitation and
ethnobiological vocabulary elicitation and specimen collection. A summary of
observable differences between the upriver dialects and the Timbuktu dialect is given in
the short Appendix 1. In the much larger Appendix 2, I describe the distinctive and
 geographically separated variety of Djenno, which I refer to as ""Djenne Chiini"" (for
jenne ciini, literally ""Djenn6 language""). Abbreviations for the Malian Songhay
 languages and varieties used in this grammar are KCh (Koyra Chiini, the present
object of study), DjCh (Djenne Chiini), KS (Koroboro Senni of Gao, etc.), and HS
 (Humburi Senni of Hombori). Names of other Songhay languages are not abbreviated.
      The wider genetic affiliation of Songhay is controversial. It is one of the few
African languages for which Joseph Greenberg (1966) did not make a confident
assignment to a large genetic stock, though he suggested Nilo-Saharan as a possible
connection. Nicolai (1984, 1990) has suggested a possible Creole origin in which
Tamashek (Tuareg) played a major lexifying role, but this has not won wide
acceptance. It might be advisable to defer reconsideration of the wider affiliation of the
 Songhay complex until we have better descriptions of the several varieties within the
complex and can thus do serious reconstruction of Proto-Songhay.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]"
"     For the possibility of opting out of logophoric pronouns in long quotations, see
the following section. For cases involving sloppy (partial) coreference, as in 'he, said
they,y would come' and 'theyxy said shey would come,' see §10.4.2.
     It is not at all uncommon for an extended quotation to itself include embedded
second-order quotations. Suppose we have a sequence of the schematic type (624).",[342]
"    Examples with first or second person in the X (transferred object) role, as in 'They
gave you to him,' do not occur in my data.
    The syntax of 'give' also works for cerbu 'show'. (450a,c) show the double-
object pattern, while (450b) has a dative indirect object. The double-object pattern is
somewhat less common for 'show' than for 'give', samba 'send' is often a well-
behaved transitive-plus-dative verb, but textual examples like (450d) show that it can
express a pronominal indirect object as a direct-object enclitic before a full NP
functioning as theme (object sent).(450)    a.   qgi-ye     na       derbu   ga     [ggi-ye   bomo]

              ""They send them (=parents-in-law) a ceremonial parent-in-law plate.'     nin 'drink', qaa 'eat', and bey 'know' are transitive verbs: qaa ga 'eat it' (with
3SgO g ). The direct object is often omitted as in English (Ί have drunk', Ί have
eaten,' Ί know'). They are thus only weakly transitive, and accordingly can be made
causative by adding Fact-Caus suffix -ndi (§6.2.2), hence nin-di 'give to drink',
rjaa-ndi 'feed', and bey-ndi 'inform, teach', ffin-ditends to be used in special senses
including 'irrigate'. The causatives of 'eat' and 'know' are recorded in VPs of the type
ijaa-ndi Υ Ζ and bey-ndi Υ Ζ, with two unmarked postverbal NPs, one (Y)
representing the underlying agent of 'eat' or 'know', the other (Z) representing the
underlying object. As usual with postverbal constituents, the linear order of Υ and Ζ is
variable (§9.1.1). No adposition is present in the available examples, whether both Υ
and Ζ remain in place, or one of them is extracted (e.g. as a WH-interrogative). An
example involving extraction is (451); see also (207b-c) in §6.2.2.(451)         mey na ni            gaa-ndi        t       bital

"     The pattern by which an antecedent NP binds the possessor of another NP to its
right is relevant not only when the antecedent is a subject NP but also within NP
conjunctions of the schematic type 'X and [X's Y]' (§5.11.1-2), for any possessed NP
Y. In fact we do get 3Refl pronouns in possessive function in this combination, as in
336     10 Anaphora, logophorics, and reported speech(646a,c). However, if the order of the conjuncts is reversed (a dispreferred but elicitable
pattern), we get nonreflexive third person instead of 3Refl possessor (646b).(646)     a.   [qga nda [ijgu          fiaaj]       koy     mowti

6.3.2 Verb-verb compoundsIt is very easy to combine VPs, by putting the second one in infinitival VP form
(beginning with Inf ka); see §9.7.1. This can be used to combine two VPs, both of
reasonable internal complexity. It can also be used to combine a specialized serial verb
with an internally complex second VP (§9.7.2).
     The limiting case is a tightly-knit combination of two verb stems linked by ka
with no further frills, or with following postverbal material (direct object, PPs) that
140 6 Verbal voice and verb derivationappears to be attached to the verb-combination as a whole rather than just to the
second verb. In such combinations, which we refer to as verb-verb compounds, the
order of elements is usually fixed, and the compound as a whole can be nominalized or
form other verbal derivatives.
    A common example is sar ka julli 'do somersaults', with sar 'jump' and a
second verb that is not attested outside of this compound. Other examples generally
involve paired actions that commonly occur together in some activity (cf. English cut
and run). That the system is potentially productive is shown by (218).(218)         a           na     ci [jokoro          ka     sakara]         nono

              'It isn't turning over (earth) and thinning out (seedlings).'","[155, 156]"
"     The examples in (405) show clear separation between the negative clause and the
following exception phrase. This is always found with subject NPs, since the subject
NP of the negative clause is always separated from the 'except' phrase by other
material. However, optionally in the case of clause-final direct objects, and even more
commonly with other clause-final constituents (spatiotemporal adverbials,
instrumental phrases), the correlative constituent in the negative clause is dispensed
with and we get what looks like a single clause. Examples in (406).(406)     a.   wirci woo si              din    bara   farka      kul kaa yekuwa

              'There are many ailments that they can't cure except with alkaafun
                (spice).'     (406a-b) involve direct object NPs, (406c) a spatiotemporal adverbial, and (406d-e)
instrumental NPs. When the constituent in question is a direct object, the fuller two-
part construction (405b-c) appears to be grammatically preferable to the single-clause
pattern (406a-b). In (406a), for example, the quantifier kul 'all' (= 'any') shows up on
the NP in the 'except' phrase, though it would make more sense on the (omitted)
correlative NP in the initial negative clause (""That disease doesn't afflict any donkey,
except a donkey that is healthy'). I think, then, that we can regard the single-clause
type (406a-b) as a truncated version of the fuller construction.
     The two instrumental examples (406d-e) show different word orders, kala 'except'
preceding nda in (406d), while bara 'except' follows nda in (406e). Follow-up
elicitation with Timbuktu informants showed that nda bara X and bara nda X are
interchangeable.
     There are some textual examples where bara or kala takes scope over a following
clause denoting an eventuality that serves as an exception to that expressed by the
preceding negative clause. Here we gloss bara or kala freely as 'except that ...'. This
is arguably the case in (407a-c).(407)    a.   bana sii_^     a    ra,    haya foo sii^        a      ra    bara

"     In most cases, as in (559a), the hal clause denotes an eventuality that is both a
factual and an intended result of the eventuality denoted in the preceding clause.
However, in (559b) the result is quite unintended by the unfortunate animal. There are
also examples where the intended result was not in fact actualized, as in (560).(560)         ay     faani hal       ay     ma        duu       wuraa,

9.7 Infinitival VPs and serial verbsIn this section we begin our analysis of infinitival VPs, which consist of Inf
morpheme ka plus a VP (without subject NP or any MAN morphemes). Examples of
Inf VPs are ka koy 'to go' and ka noo ga_^ i se 'to give it to them'. Infinitival
complements lack Impf or Subju markers and cannot take normal negation; for a
rough functional equivalent of negation see the discussion of serial-verb jen in §9.7.6.
    The regular constructions involving Inf ka can be classified as in (577).(577)      first   part    second part       comments
          a. VP            Inf + VP          event sequence
          b. serial verb   Inf + VP          common serial-verb pattern
          c. VP            Inf + serial verb less common serial-verb pattern
          d. verb          Inf + verb        verb-verb compound
          e. NP            Inf + VP          in certain idiomatic phrases     By ""serial verb"" we mean a verb that is specialized to occur in combination with a
fuller VP, which we will call the ""substantive VP."" Most serial verbs occur in pattern
(577b). The less common pattern (577c), where the substantive VP precedes the
specialized serial verb, is found with ben 'end, finish' (§9.7.5) and in the comparative
construction with bisa 'exceed' (§9.7.8). The full VP represents the core scenario
('boy kill dog'), while the attached serial verb adds a grammatical category (aspect,
mood), motion, or a higher predicate (e.g. 'try').
     In the following sections we consider in turn the various formal subtypes shown
in (577a-c,e). Several sections are devoted to serial verbs, which encompass several
distinct semantic complexes. For the relatively few verb-verb compounds of type
(577d), see §6.3.2.
     Notably absent from these sections are desideratives (Ί want to go'), verbs of
allowing and preventing (Ί let him eat,' Ί prevented him from eating'), and for the
most part purposives (Ί slaughtered the sheep in order to eat it'). Though these often
                                            9.7 Infinitival VPs and serial verbs   305take infinitive form in English and other familiar languages, they are expressed in
KCh by finite subjunctive clauses, e.g., Ί want that I go' (§9.6).
    Certain serial-verbs in pattern (577b) take zero or ta instead of ka as the Inf
marker. See (§9.7.2) for a full inventory of serial verbs and of their syntactic
peculiarities.
    Rarely, Inf ka is used to overtly nominalize a VP which is fronted as a focused
NP constituent. See §4.3.5.
    Infinitival VPs cannot be conjoined by nda 'and', and cannot be complements of
adpositions (e.g. preposition nda 'with' or Dative postposition se). However, wala
Or' may be used, as in (578).(578)        a       ma      si koy bar qgu^            o      guna gi
             3SgS Subju Neg go say LogoSgS Impf see 3P1O
             ka jow ferey ka warra gi                   [nda ga]

             wala [ka jow bundu] ka bar...
             or      [Inf take stick]         Inf say ...
             'He should not go and think that he sees them, and take a brick and
              throw it at them, or take a stick and think (intend)...""","[320, 321]"

11.7 Body parts
     On the whole, the semantics of body-part terms (""partonyms"") is unremarkable.
As in all languages there are extensions from human parts to animal parts, parts of
objects, topography, and relative spatial orientation ('behind', etc.). There are also the
usual associations between certain body parts and ethnopsychology. In (721) we
indicate some of the ramifications of partonymics.(721)        basic term   primary sense        other senses or uses
              banda
              '     '     'back'

              bine        'heart'              Topic (§8.4.1); emotions (§11.4)
              biiri       'bone*               'hardness'
              homo ~ boqo 'head'               'ball'; reflexive pronoun (§10.2.1)
             gurjgu       'belly'              'mound (in earth); island (in river)'
             hambir       'hair'               'feather'
             jinde        'neck'               'voice'
             kamba        'hand, arm'          'branch (of tree); hold onto [verb]'
              kanje       'knee'               '(exterior) corner or side'
              kuuru       'skin'               'hide, pelt'
              linji       'muscle, nerve'      'root'
              mee         'mouth'              'doorway (of house); bank (of river)'
              niine       'nose*               'pointed tip'
              tefie       'forehead'           'good luck'     Perhaps the most interesting semantic extensions are those of mee 'mouth'. In
the sense 'doorway' it denotes the passageway rather than the door as a physical object
(called gambu). In the compound isa-mee with the term for 'river' it denotes the bank
(contract English river mouth with very different sense). The common thread is the
notion 'entranceway', the bank being the ""entrance"" to the river.
     To understand the topographic extensions of gurjgu to 'mound* and 'island', it is
useful to note that most ""islands"" are alternately exposed and submerged (fully or
partially) during the yearly flood cycle. An ""island"" is therefore simply a mound or
rise, relative to surrounding lower terrain that is seasonally inundated.
374   11 Semantic topics      'Egg' is expressed with compounds involving tondi 'stone', e.g., gororjgo-tondi
'chicken stone (=egg)'. This probably reflects tabooing of *guijguri, the old word for
'egg', due to its originally secondary (now primary) sense 'testicle'.
     In the case of bine, the connection of 'heart' to emotions is natural, but its
identity or homophony to Topic morpheme bine may reflect a recent convergence
(some KS dialects distinguish bine 'heart' from binde Topic marker). Other cases of
apparently accidental homophony, with no discernible semantic link, include moo
('eye', 'also', and 'rice crop', in upriver dialects also 'daybreak'), dee ('foot, leg' and
'time, instance'), boy ('[finger-, toe-]nail', 'millet soup', and 'herd [animals]'), and
tasa ('liver' and 'push').
      Some terms occurring in interesting compounds are kuri 'blood* (kuri-buan-o
'lazy', literally ""blood-weak""), moo 'eye' (moo-futu 'wrongly placed, upside-down',
literally ""eye-bad""; moo-koog-o 'impolite person', literally ""eye-dry""; moo-konn-ey
'bad mood', literally ""eye-heat""; moo-yeen-ey 'coolness, self-control', literally ""eye-
coldness""). Other terms include haga 'ear', deene 'tongue', hine 'tooth', gande
'chest', hime 'navel', findi 'buttocks', bulle 'anus', kumbu 'lung', teeli 'intestines,
entrails', foori 'penis' (means 'testicles' or 'venereal disease' in some other Songhay
languages), tinji 'waist', bute or dofe 'vagina', and fa/a 'female breast*.
     The usual term for '(living) body' is gaa, which may be the source of the
postposition ga On'. (The homonym gaa 'camp, encampment* is a variant of dagaa.)
For '(dead) body* the term bukow 'corpse* must be used. The key terms for spiritual
and mental components of a person are hunde 'soul, life-force', lakal 'thought, mind,
intelligence, memory, imagination', and bii 'shadow, (visual) image, reflection,
photo'.
                                  Appendix l
                                Upriver dialects
As one goes up the Niger River westward from Timbuktu, the major KCh-speaking
towns are, in order, Dir£ (D), Tonka (To), and Niafunko (N). Goundam (G) is actually
a few miles north of Tonka in an area characterized by a few large seasonal lakes like
Lake Fati. Tape recordings were made in Timbuktu with an N speaker who had just
come for a regional cultural festival, and from three G natives (whose speech showed
some Timbuktu dialectal influence). After these were provisionally transcribed, I went
to N for three days to check some problematic words or phrases from the tapes, and to
do lexical and some grammatical elicitation. I also stopped in G on the way back and
did some lexical and grammatical elicitation there. The dialect from villages near Dire*
in the texts published by Zouber (1983) are close to that of G.
     The following comments are based mainly on N. Lexical differences are given in
the dictionary, and minor points are covered in notes to the text collection. We note
briefly that there is very extensive Fulfulde (Fula) influence in N, and considerable
Tamashek (Tuareg) and some Arab influence around G. Most of the comments below
deal with differences vis- -vis Timbuktu, but some confirm Timbuktu features for G
and N where this seems useful in the context of comparative Songhay studies.
     There are some similarities between the upriver dialects and KS, in spite of the
fact that Timbuktu intervenes physically between them. Timbuktu is the major urban
center in the region and is several kilometers off the river on sand dunes; most of its
inhabitants have little to do with the riverine economy (fishing, rice growing, boat
transportation). Some of the current population along the river in the area from Dir6 to
Niafunk6 may have originally come from the KS zone along the river, rather than
radiating out from Timbuktu.","[389, 390, 391]"
"    In one passage (824), Infinitive ka follows French pour que 'so that' in an event
sequence. Contrast the subjunctive complement of pour que in (816), §9.6.2, above.
The effect is like French pour plus infinitive (pour chercher...).(824)                ... ka     koy goy, pour que ka wir atam kayna quoi
                     ... Inf go work, so-that Inf seek grain little indeed

9.6.4 Subjunctive clauses with complementizers (hal, bilaa)The particle hal can be used as a quasi-preposition before a (spatiotemporal) NP or
NP-like adverbial in the sense 'until, all the way to' (§5.9.8). As a clause-initial

The subjunctive type, to be analysed in this section, is extremely common. It is the
basic purposive and result clause construction and can be glossed 'so that ... , in order
that... , with the result that...'. Examples in (559).(559)    a. yer ο         faani, hal [yer ma           moor [dow di         cirej]

Arabic, an extension of my long-standing research in Maghrebi Arabic. I was surprised
to find the region attractive and have been going back ever since; as the proverb says,
                                                           1.6 Acknowledgements        9hamni har, na n guna hay kaa no-o baa, ma bun a ra 'the fly said, if you find
something you like, you should die in it.'
     I continued to work mainly on Hassaniya Arabic and secondarily on Songhay
varieties during fieldwork periods of two to three months each in 1989 (Gao) and 1990
(Timbuktu), financed in part by the University of Michigan. I then received National
Science Foundation grant BNS-9020409, which enabled me to focus my fieldwork on
Songhay in two additional two-month stints in Mali in 1991 and 1992. The primary
objective was to assess the possibility that KCh was the result of ""semi-creolization""
of a prior Gao-type Songhay variety during the Medieval Songhay Empire.
     During the course of the NSF project I did exploratory work on DjCh and HS, in
addition to gathering more material from Timbuktu and Gao. It became clear to me
that these new data were complicating the rather simple notion of ""semi-creolization""
that I had proposed as a working hypothesis, and that more depth was needed in the
grammatical analysis and vocabulary. In particular, DjCh, though very close to KCh
in some ways (sound changes, basic lexicon), departed from it quite significantly in
fundamental aspects of syntactic structure and phonemic systems. The upshot was that
instead of an expected sharp break between KS (and HS) on the one hand and Western
Songhay (KCh and DjCh) on the other, I was finding major phonemic and
morphosyntactic isoglosses that seemed to cut across the major genetic boundary,
some linking KCh with KS and apparently others linking DjCh with HS. This
suggested a more complex historical sociolinguistic model involving continuing
contact among neighboring Songhay varieties, rather than a ""big bang"" original
creolization of Western Songhay followed by minor dialectal divergences. The role of
other adjoining languages (especially Hassaniya Arabic, Tamashek, Fulfulde, Bozo,
and Bambara) would also have to be dealt with.
     I did another summer of fieldwork in 1993, with travel support from the
University of Michigan. Then I received grant RT-21610-94 from the National
Endowment for the Humanities, covering summer fieldwork in 1995 and extended
fieldwork during a sabbatical year from fall 1996 to summer 1997. The main objective
of the NEH project is the preparation of grammar-text-dictionary works covering the
four major Songhay varieties of Mali (KCh and DjCh, along with KS and HS). The
grammars, dictionaries (with French and English glosses), and text collections for
KCh, DjCh, and KS are being prepared simultaneously, while the HS materials will
follow a year or so later.
     I prefer not to disclose the names of my informants, local assistants, and hosts, so
I will thank them in other ways. I do, however, wish to publicly thank the linguists
and community leaders who have been helpful to me. Prof. Robert Nicola'i of the
Universite de Nice helped to arrange my short stay in Nice in 1995 and has made his
collection of (mostly untranscribed) early tape recordings available to me. In Mali, I
have benefited from extensive collaboration with linguists at DNAFLA in Bamako,
especially the ""Songhayisants"" Yousouf Maiga and Yousouf Haidara. Another Malian
colleague is Ibrahima Traore, a professor at the ENSUP in Bamako, who has also been
helpful. In Timbuktu, I have worked extensively with an amateur linguist, Aldiouma
Amadou dit Diadie, who has compiled his own extensive KCh lexicon. In Djenne, I
have many debts to Ibrahima Kone, now a businessman, and Baba Ibrahima Toure,
director of the local French-Arabic school.
10   1 Introduction     Finally, I owe a special debt of gratitude to the American and Malian employees
of USIS in the American Embassy in Bamako, who have always been extremely
helpful to me in connection with research clearances, visas, tape duplication, and other
small but vitally important administrative matters. They provided this assistance not
only during my Fulbright visit in 1986, when they were expected to, but also in the
ensuing years when I had no official embassy status. The American PAO's there
generally do two-year stints, and I have been through several of them; I particularly
thank the legendary Linda Buggeln, who put me up in her residence for several days
one year when I returned from the field with incapacitating boils on my legs. Without
the assistance and friendly advice over the years of the permanent Malian employees of
USIS—Issa, Kalifa, and especially Gaousou—I would probably have taken my act to
some other country.

2.1 Brief outline of typical sentence and NP structuresFor purposes of initial orientation, this section provides examples of typical sentence
structures. The basic constituent order is SVO (subject-verb-object), and more
precisely the ordering in (5):(5)            subject NP - mood-aspect-negation (MAN) - V - other constituents    Examples of the pattern are in (6-8), with multi-word constituents enclosed in
brackets.(6)            [bar      di}    ο      guna [woy      di]   doodi

11.4 Emotion and personality     We begin with a comprehensive list of verbs of transient emotional state or pain
(711 a), along with a few terms for more complex object-directed emotions (7lib) and
intelligence or personality attributes (71 Ic).(711)    a. dukur                  'be angry'

            horon                  'feel heat; feel sharp pain'
             tujur                 'feel pain (mental or physical)'
            jelleju                'ache'
            fiaali                 'joy; be joyful'

         c. futu                   'be nasty, naughty, violent, angry, furious'
             fuuye                 'be lazy, idle'
             ladab [n.]            'polite person'
             mey lakal             'have intelligence (=be smart)'
             neeri [n.]            'stupid person'    Aside from the simple lexical items in (711 a), emotional states can also be
expressed by more complex ""metaphorical"" phrases. Common expressions for
happiness and sadness involve a possessed form of bine 'heart' as subject NP.
Examples in (712).

          c.   a bine nun      ""his heart left""        'he has lost hope'      Expressions like 'X tied Y's head' or 'Y's head is tied' are used to indicate that Υ
is confused, tongue-tied, in a dilemma, or otherwise incapacitated by an external
situation. An example is a-a haw ni bomo 'it puts you (i.e., anyone) in a dilemma'
(lit., 'it ties your head').
      Euphoric and dysphoric moods can also be expressed by the construction in (713).(713)          transcription        literal sense         free translation

11.5 Kinship
     We commented on compound-like or otherwise segmentable kin expressions in
§4.6.6. Here our focus is on the semantic system. Abbreviations are Fa[ther],
Mo[ther], Br[other], Sifster], So[n], Daughter], Hu[sband], Wi[fe]. ""+"" before a
kintype means 'elder', ""-"" means 'younger'. Thus Fa+Si means 'father's elder sister'.
     The speaker must choose on each occasion between two coexisting subsystems for
sibling terms, one based on gender and one based on seniority (birth-order). The forms
are given in (714).(714)        transcription     kintype(s)        related forms
          a. harme             Br                cf. bar 'man'
             woyme             Si                cf. woy 'woman'
          b. beere             elder sibling     cf. beer 'big'
             keyna             younger sibling   cf. keyna 'small'     While there is no fixed rule, the usual pattern is to use the seniority subsystem for
parallel-sex siblings and the gender subsystem for cross-sex siblings. Thus 'his Si' is
usually a woyme, but 'his Br' is most often expressed as either a beere 'his elder
sibling' or a keyna 'his younger sibling' depending on relative age.
     The parallel-cross and seniority oppositions ramify throughout the kinship
system. In the first ascending generation, FaBr is partially merged with Fa, and MoSi
with Mo. However, the adjectives 'big, old' and 'small, young' are generally added in
reference (though not address) to indicate seniority vis-a-vis the actual Fa or Mo.
baaba - baba 'father' may be reduced to baa in these combinations, especially in
address, and the same reduced baa occurs as the initial in certain compound personal
(nick-)names. Special stems are used for cross-kin (MoBr, FaSi) without reference to
seniority. Hence the forms in (715).

term, as with English child) is applied to one's own offspring or that of one's
brothers. There is a special term for Si's child. The basic stems are gender-neutral, but
compound finals 'man' and 'woman' can be added to specify gender (§4.6.3).
     In the first descending generation, ije 'child' is the basic term for one's own So or
Da. It is often extended to one's siblings children, especially by men to their brother's
children. There is a special ""nibling"" (nephew or niece) term tuba for Si's children,
used by men. Women often use composite expressions meaning 'Br's child' or 'Si's
child' for their siblings children. The 'child' and 'nibling' terms are optionally gender-
specified by adding compound finals (§4.6.3). Relevant forms are in (716).(716)       transcription      kintvpefs)          composition

'grandparent'. Likewise, there is a single reciprocal term haamaa 'grandchild'. As with
the terms in (716) and others to follow, -har and -woy may be used as finals to specify
gender.
     Parallel cousins (FaBr's or MoSi's children) are referred to by the sibling terms
(714). Cross-cousins, who are eligible as marriage partners and may engage in joking
relationships, are called baase with the usual optional gender marking.
     The primary spousal and affinal categories are those in (717). The affinal
categories in (717b) are optionally gender-marked by adding -haror -woy.

From the husband's viewpoint the wives are ranked by seniority (marriage order, not
birth order) as wände beer 'senior wife' and wände ciina 'junior wife' (oiina 'small').
From the perspective of one wife, another wife is called wocce (<*woy-ce) 'co-wife'.
Since polyandry is not practiced, there is no comparable relationship of 'co-husband';
the male counterpart of woace is haroe 'male lover; (male) suitor (of a woman)'.
     The term konde can denote 'FaWi who is not one's Mo' (i.e., a co-wife of one's
mother), or 'MoBrWi'.
     This sketch suffices to describe the basic consanguineal and affinal categories.
More distant kintypes can be incorporated into the system either by composite
expressions ('my cousin's child') or by semantic extension, respecting the parallel-
cross distinction (e.g., FaFaBrSoSo = 'brother').
     More general expressions for 'kin' are illustrated in text fragment (718).(718)         war     ci arrahiim yo war ci              fafa-Jje      yo

3.5.8 Stem-initial consonant clustersAside from recent loanwords, mainly from French, the only word-initial clusters are in
morphemes beginning with a nasal followed by a homorganic obstruent or nasal. The
attested clusters are mb, nn, nd, nt, nj, nc, qg, and qk. Examples: mbaaga 'lizard sp.',
nnori 'ant sp.', ndaamakolooti 'chameleon', ntende 'ant sp.', njarka 'native violin',
ncom~n£am 'mouse\qgorfu 'vine sp.', and qkanji 'tick'. As this selection suggests,
the stems in question are nouns rather than verbs, and involve biological or cultural
vocabulary, especially fauna, rather than basic vocabulary such as kin terms and body
parts. Perhaps they were originally borrowings from a language with a noun-class
prefix something like *aN- (the vowel is preserved in HS), or regionally distributed
words with an ultimate origin in such a language. However, there are indications that
some cases of this initial cluster type are secondary, reflecting a certain productivity for
the nasal ""prefix"" in the biological domain. (It seems especially productive in some
upriver dialects, especially around Dir6.)
     As noted in §3.5.2, initial nasal-obstruent clusters also occur in a handful of
grammatical morphemes. The examples are nda 'with, and', Logo/3ReflSg qgu, and
3SgF qga, plus the plural counterparts of these latter two.
                                    3.6 Consonantal assimilations and deletions      29     The initial clusters mentioned in this section are not entirely stable. Some of the
nouns in question also have variants without the initial nasal, nda 'with, and' has a
variant pronunciation na, and Logo/3ReflSg ijgu has a similar variant qu.","[44, 45]"
"
3.7.8 Deletion of word-initial vowels (apheresis)Except for French loans and a few grammatical morphemes such as personal pronouns,
words do not normally begin with vowels. The two chief exceptions are Arabic loans
beginning in a, and certain nouns and adjectives beginning in /'. Many of the Arabic
loans probably entered KCh from other African languages (cf. §3.10.8), which
probably accounts for the variation in their form.
     Arabic has a definite prefix al-, which undergoes a special assimilation to a
following coronal consonant (affricate j is treated in Classical Arabic as noncoronal,
but in most modern Maghrebi dialects as coronal). As with Arabic loans into European
languages (algebra, algorithm), Arabic nouns borrowed into KCh often include the old
definite prefix, though the prefix is no longer segmentable and no longer marks
defmiteness. This gives rise to the KCh surface patterns in (43), where T is a coronal
consonant and K is a noncoronal (velar, labial) consonant:(43)       Four onset types of nouns borrowed from Arabic
           a. alKV... , as in albacir 'miser';
           b. a/V... after loss of glottal stop or pharyngeal, as in alaahidu 'promise';
           c. IV... , as in (b), with further elision of the initial *a, as in ladab 'polite
                 person';
           d. aTTV... , as in adduhaa 'mid-morning'.",[53]
"
8.1 Focus constructionsMany sentences have no special focus marking. There are, however, productive devices
for marking a particular non-verb constituent (pronoun, full NP, PP, lexical adverbial)
as grammatical ""focus."" The semantic-pragmatic point of marking a focus is to
highlight it as a choice made among two or more logically possible options. The
focused constituent therefore bears the most contestable, unexpected, or novel
information. WH-questions, and answers to them, are the prototypical examples.
     Syntactically, the focused constituent is fronted to the left of the obligatory core
of the sentence (subject NP, MAN morphemes, verb). In most cases a focus
morpheme [SFoc or Foe] is inserted between the focused constituent and the core of
the sentence. Nonsubject and subject focus constructions must be distinguished.",[182]
"     Here moo is not locally attached to the PP a ra, which in fact is precisely the one
constituent shared by 'there are fish in it* and 'they farm in it.' As (409), shows, when
moo is connected to a specific PP, it attaches to the NP preceding the postposition,
whereas in (410) moo follows the entire PP. Therefore, in (410) moo has clausal
scope.
     There are a small number of textual instances where moo is positioned after a verb
before postverbal constituents, but none where moo can really be described as having
narrow scope over the verb. In (345) in §8.3.7, above, positioning of moo after a
transitive verb may be due to the heaviness of the following direct object NP (which
includes a long relative clause).
     Examples like (410) are common, but there are also quite a few textual examples
where moo is physically attached to the subject NP (or a preposed topical NP) but
where the context suggests clausal scope. In other words, moo can attach to the
subject or preposed topical NP for convenience, allowing the speaker to specify at the
230     8 Discourse-functional constructions and relativizationbeginning of the current sentence its additive relationship to the preceding discourse.
This seems to be typical when moo functions at the pragmatic level (Ί tell you
moreover that...'), where the absence of overtly realized pragmatic material forces the
speaker to attach moo (which cannot stand alone) to a surrogate constituent. Consider
(411).(411)          ... bara /       ma jirfiti      a     bomo^woo ka gaa ga,

"    When the quoted speaker is second person, we likewise usually get a 2Sg or 2P1

with the original first person pronoun preserved inside the quote (62Ib). In neither case
does coreferentiality with the quoted speaker result in logophoric pronouns.(621)     a.   ni   har yene       [ay ma        kata mana sukal              di]

               party for him, let's go help him.'""     Since logophoric pronouns cannot be coindexed with a quoted speaker who is
expressed as a first or second person pronoun, Logo should be thought of as a special
type of third person pronoun. However, within the quotation itself it has affinities
with first person, since Logo is the reported-speech replacement of a direct-speech first
person pronoun.
     The relationship of logophoric pronouns to the classic lst-2nd-3rd persons can
also be analysed by studying the normal relative order of two pronouns conjoined by
nda 'and, with'; see (157) in §5.11.1. Leaving logophoric pronouns aside for the
moment, the ordering hierarchy is 1st > 2nd > ""3F' > {3Sg, 3P1}. There are two
logical ways, a priori, to fit logophoric pronouns into this system. One would be to
take Logo as a relatively high-ranking 3rd person pronoun, preceding ordinary {3Sg,
3P1} and perhaps even ""3F* pronouns but following all 1st and 2nd person categories.
The other approach would be to treat Logo as an embedded 1st person pronoun, and so
locate it hierarchically ahead of 2nd person. In fact, the data show examples of both
possible hierarchizations. The textual example (622a) shows Logo ijgu following 2Sg,
while the elicited example (622b) shows the opposite ordering. Textual example
(622c) shows that Logo precedes ordinary 3rd person pronouns, while the elicited
(622d) has Logo following a true 1st person pronoun.(622)    a.   ni      nda rjgu...

                                         qu-yo, qu-ye, qu-ya     We normally transcribe the plural forms as single words, e.g. qgi-yo. One could
argue, however, that two-word transcriptions like qgi yo are structurally appropriate,
even though the two components seem to interact phonologically in ways that do not
apply to combinations of noun stems plus PI yo. There is one possible piece of direct
evidence for the two-word representation, viz., the (uncommon) elicited sequence qgi
woo yo 'they (there)', with demonstrative woo apparently inserted between the two
parts of qgi yo (§5.5). However, qgi woo yo is structurally parallel to yer woo yo
'we here' with 1P1 pronoun yer, and the fact that we get qgi (not qga or qgu) in qgi
woo yo suggests that this phrase might better be analysed as a contraction of //rjgi-yo
woo yo// with two instances of the PI morpheme.
48   3 Phonology     3SgF qga and Logo/3Refl qgu are normally indistinguishable as subject markers
before Impf o, since VV-Contraction (§3.7.1) applies, giving [rjgo:] in both cases. In
our practical transcription we maintain the underlying distinction, using the ligature to
indicate that contraction occurs: qga^ ο versus ggu^ o. In transcribing texts, we must
use judgement in deciding which transcription is valid in each instance, and readers
have the right to second-guess our judgements.
     The morphosyntactic environments which allow unmarked ""3"" pronouns, and
those which require a shift to ""3F' (Full) pronouns, are given and exemplified in
§8.4.2. In general, unmarked ""3"" pronouns are used when they are not directly modified
(by a following Top, Emph, Foe, or other DF morpheme, by demonstrative woo, or
any adjective or quantifier), and when they function as arguments of a following
element or phrase (subject, postpositional complement, possessor). These can be
described informally as ""proclitic"" positions. The variant ""3"" pronouns, 3SgO ga and
3P1O gi ~ ji, are used in direct object function (immediately following a verb), and as
complements of the preposition nda 'with, and' (including right conjunct position in
""X and Y""). These can be thought of informally as ""enclitic"" positions. By contrast,
the ""exposed"" positions requiring the shift from ""3"" to ""3F' forms are those where the
pronoun is a phrasal head followed by a modifier or DF morpheme, or occurs in
isolation.
     Typical examples of 3SgF gga are qga bine 'as for 3Sg' and the left conjunct in
ηga nda gi (""3SgF and 3ΡΓ). 3Sg a would be ungrammatical in these positions: #a
bine, #a nda gi. The sequence a bine is grammatical in a different sense 'his heart'.
     In possessor function, ""3F' pronouns can be used instead of 3Sg a or 3P1 i. This
option is especially common when the following noun stem begins with a vowel,
which could trigger VV-Contraction and therefore cause the 3Sg or 3P1 morpheme to
disappear. Thus instead of tila^albarka 'its spiritual power' we normally get either ijga^
albarka with 3SgF pronoun, or a wane^ albarka with overt possessive postposition.
However, ""3F' pronouns are also sporadically used instead of 3Sg or 3P1 in possessor
function even before C-initial stems.","[63, 64]"
"      These examples illustrate the frequent use of jinaa as a linker between two clauses
denoting events that are strictly ordered chronologically. The construction is thus A
jinaa B where A and B represent clauses. The prosodic break (shown as a comma) can
be either before or after jinaa In the case of A jinaa, B where jinaa behaves
prosodically as a clause-final particle for A, we may translate fairly literally as Ά first,
 (then) B.' In the case of A, jinaa Β we could translate as Ά (first), then B.' The
parenthesized adverbials (first, then) can be derived inferentially in either translation. In
these constructions, jinaa closely resembles parallel uses of the Emph particle dee
(§8.5.7). However, jinaa has distinct properties under negation, where it means '(not)
yet' (§9.3.5).
      Other English quantificational adverbs are rendered in KCh by specialized serial
verbs followed by infinitival VPs. Some relevant serial verbs are filla 'repeat', yee
 'return, do again', and dooney 'be accustomed to' (§9.7.5).
      Spatiotemporal adverbials usually provide a setting (in space or time) for the
entire eventuality denoted by the sentence. They may follow the verb, be fronted
(extracted) in the nonsubject focus construction (§8.1.1), or be preposed as topic-like
constituents preceding the sentence (§8.4.1). Preposing is typical of temporal rather
than spatial adverbials; it is standard with saa di 'then, at that time, in that situation,
so', which connects the time or situation of the following sentence with that of prior
discourse. In the case of moreyda 'now', proposing is fairly common, but it tends to
follow another proposed topical constituent ('[The man] now, he came here""),
suggesting a kind of enclitic status. The primary spatial adverbials like nee 'here' and
 doodi ~ dooti 'there' generally follow the verb or, if highlighted, are focalized.
      Spatiotemporal PPs with (mainly spatial) postpositions like ga 'by, on, from', or
Loc ra or kuna, are tricky because they are often complements of verbs (of motion,
stance, etc.), as in 'they entered [into the house],' rather than stage-setters for the entire
eventuality. Their interactions with verbs are described, with many examples, in
 §11.1.
                                                        9.3 Operators and scope 253     English lexical manner adverbials, with VP scope, are generally rendered by
constructions involving two verbs, either in two separate clauses or in a serial-verb
combination. Thus 'we dig deeply into the ground' comes out in KCh as 'we dig, so
that (subjunctive) we go far under the ground,' while 'it rises rapidly' is expressed in
serial-verb form as KCh 'it hurries to arise.' There are, however, some forms that are
commonly added to VPs in the fashion of English lexical manner adverbs, notably
those in (458).(458)         form                         gloss
              mooso, mooso-mooso           'gently, slowly, delicately'
              tamba, tamba-tamba           'fast, quickly, immediately, early'   Examples of the two adverbials are (459a-b). (459c) shows that the negation of
tamba is the common way to translate '(come, be) late'.(459)    a.   nda     ni        waay         [nda     ga]     tamba
              if      2SgS be-aware          [with 3SgO] fast
              'if you(Sg) become aware of it promptly'
         b.   a-a            fana mooso-mooso
              3SgS-Impf      crawl Rdp-slow
              'He crawls slowly.'
         c.   a       na       kaa        tamba
              3SgS Neg         come fast
              'He came late.' (lit., 'He didn't come early.')     tamba can also be used as a verb 'hurry, do fast, go fast', and can therefore occur
in imperatives like (460a). mooso, on the other hand, remains adverbial in the sense
'do slowly' and combines with the ""light"" verb dam 'do', as in (460b).(460)    a.   wo            tamba
              2PlImpera do-fast
              'You(Pl) do it quickly!' (imperative)
         b.   wo            dam      mooso
              2PlImpera do           slow
              'You(Pl) do it slowly (gently)!' (imperative)      Subject-oriented adverbials resemble manner adverbials in their syntactic position,
but have a specific semantic relationship to the subject NP. KCh appears to lack
lexical subject-oriented adverbials (On purpose', 'carefully'). On purpose' is expressed
not by an adverbial, rather by a serial-verb construction, as in (461), which could be
literally glossed as e.g. 'she meant to hit me' but which has a stronger implication
that the intended action was carried out.(461)         a        murey           ka         kar     ey
              3SgS     do-on-purpose Inf          hit     ISgO
              'She hit me on purpose.'
254     9 Sentence-level syntax and semantics     Instrumental-comitative phrases consisting of nda 'with, and' and a following NP
(§5.11.3-4) function in some cases as subject-oriented adverbials, in other cases as
manner (VP-oriented) adverbials, in still others as regular complements of particular
verbs (§6.1.6). In (462a), the associates (even though inanimate) are strongly
connected with the agent-subject, hence a paraphrase like '[You and they (=tools)] will
go and work.' Instrumental phrases like that in (462b) are a little harder to massage
into a similar paraphrase, but the instrument (here 'limestone' as a building material)
is a necessary link between the agent and the denoted activity ('build it'). On the other
hand, idiomatic phrases with nda like 'by its road' (= 'properly') in (462c) are best
described as manner adverbials, and in this particular case the 3Sg pronoun possessor
is probably coreferential to the direct object 'it' (=wall).(462)     a.   ni     rjga_^ o       koy    goy nda [[[a            wan    di yo]

§4.3.2 we discussed similar cases where a stem may be used as a verb or noun without
derivational affixes. Subsequent sections will describe overt morphological derivations
which change valency.

respectively, in the transitive case.(204)       verb        intransitive gloss          transitive gloss (O = direct object)

         d. kaa         'S come'                    'S become (turn into) O'     In (204a-b), the grammatical subject of the intransitive corresponds to the direct
object of the transitive. In (204a), the intransitive events or states can occur in the
absence of an external agent, so we might argue that the transitive usage is the
semantic factitive-causative of the intransitive. On the other hand, in (204b) the
intransitive events or states strongly imply the presence of an (unexpressed) agent, so
134 6 Verbal voice and verb derivationwe could argue that here the intransitive usage is a semantic passive based on the
transitive. In (204c), the intransitive omits the direct object of the transitive, so the
intransitive can be thought of as a kind of antipassive.
     In (204d), the connection between 'come* and 'become' is less transparent, but
English come to be, and the use of motion verbs to mean 'become' in many other
languages (Fr. devenir, Spanish volverse), makes the connection more reasonable.
KCh kaa 'become' is formally a transitive verb, and the direct object can be a pronoun
like 3SgO ga, as in (205).(205)         ay     kaa    ga
              ISgS become 3SgO
              Ί became it.'","[149, 150]"
"
3.3 DiphthongsBy ""diphthong"" we mean the sequence of a vowel nucleus plus a semivowel coda y or
w within a syllable, i.e., word-internally before another consonant or word-finally.
There is some justification for treating diphthongs as quasi-units, since only certain
vowel-semivowel combinations occur. All diphthongs in the language are upgliding
(vowel plus semivowel).
                                                                 3.3 Diphthongs        193.3.1 Short-nucleus diphthongsIn KCh, the following short-nucleus diphthongs are well-established in the sense that
they can occur word-finally in nouns and verbs: {oy ew ey~ay ow~aw}. These
diphthongs all involve low or mid-height nuclei. The diphthongs iw and uy, with high
nucleus and sharp differentiation of nucleus and coda, are attested but rare, iw occurs in
the semi-onomatopoeic titiw 'shatter', and in one variant of ciwsi ~ cipsi 'sacrificial
ram' (<Ar. kabs). uy occurs in the intensifying interjection buy! associated with the
concept 'yellow' (§9.2). (See below on the aberrant phonetics of intensifiers.) It also
occurs in one uncommon noun, nama uy 'bullfrog sp.' The remaining possibilities,
#iy and #uw, with high nucleus and minimal differentiation of nucleus and coda, are
unattested as diphthongs. We now consider the four well-established types in more
detail.
      oy is structurally unproblematic and common; examples are boy 'fingernail',
 boyro 'good' (related to boon 'be good'), doy 'float', garboy 'date', goy 'work', gumoy
 'dock', hoy 'sauce', kokoy 'chief, koy 'go', koyne 'again', and moy 'namesake'. It
also occurs in some -ey nominalizations of verbs with stem-final o such as moqg-oy
 'inability' (<moggo 'fail'), compare send-ey 'difficulty' (<sendu 'be difficult').
      ew is structurally parallel to oy (mid-height nucleus, nucleus maximally
differentiated from coda). However, it is rather uncommon and it may have been less
stable over time than oy. It occurs in deelew 'spark', felew 'be light (in weight)', and
hew 'wind, air, smell', dow ~ dew 'sand' fluctuates between ow and ew, for yow ~
yew 'guest' and similar forms with preceding palatal or palatoalveolar, see the end of
this section.
     The diphthongs ey~ay and ow~aw constitute another pair of structurally parallel
diphthongs. Each shows neutralization of the opposition between a and the
neighboring mid-height vowel closest to the articulation of the coda (e for y, for w).
The actual articulation appears to be intermediate but tending toward the mid-height
end of the relevant region, hence [ej] and [ow], except that we get a clear phonetic [a]
word-initially or following stem-initial h: haw 'tie', haw 'cow', hawru 'eat supper',
hay 'give birth', hay 'price', hayni 'millet', ay (ISg pronoun). There are few cases of
non-stem-initial h before such diphthongs, but in hahey 'sieve' I hear the diphthongs
as close to [ej]. We get nasalized [äy] in two cases of historically late nasalization of
*a. Not only do we get häysi 'dog' (<*haynsi <*hansi), where the initial h would
favor a low nucleus anyway, but we also have gäysi (<*gaynsi <*gansi) 'fonio (a
grain)'; cf. also §3.4.1. We will write ay (nasalized äy) and aw word-initially, after
stem-initial , and in words like gäysi. Elsewhere we will write ey and ow, though the
actual phonetic vowels are closer to [ej] and [DW] and there is some dialectal
variability. Examples of ey include bey 'know', dey 'buy', derey 'become lost', key
'stop', key 'weave', sey 'sow (grain)', and sey 'fever'. Examples of ow include bisow
'Acacia sp.', bow 'be abundant', bukow 'corpse', hasar-ow 'destruction' (cf. hasara
'be ruined'), hirow - hurow 'enter', yow 'bull'. For the historical shift *ab —> ow,
see §3.10.
     There are two types of lexical item which may go against the normal pattern and
maintain phonemic oppositions between ey and ay and between ow and aw. These are
interjections (particularly intensifiers) and loanwords.
20   3 Phonology     Intensifiers (§9.2) permit [a] as diphthongal nucleus after consonants other than Λ,
at least for some speakers. For one speaker I recorded a clear minimal pair: intensifier
gay! [gaj] associated with the verb kaan 'be sweet', audibly distinct from gey [gej]
'endure, be a long time' and from gaay [gay] 'restrain'. Another intensifier, tey! [tej],
associated with the verb hottu 'be hot (spicy)', shows that the ey diphthong is also
possible in interjections for this speaker. However, other speakers applied the same
neutralizations to intensifiers as to other vocabulary, and did not distinguish the
intensifier for 'be sweet' from the verb gey 'endure*.
     The ISg pronoun ay calls for comment. As a subject pronoun, before a
postposition, as a possessive, in preposed or fronted position, or in isolation, I
generally hear [aj]. However, as a postverbal direct-object morpheme it tends toward
[ej]. This probably reflects the status of direct-object pronominals as enclitics, with
less natural stress than pronouns in other positions. In other words, it appears that [ej]
is the ""lax"" counterpart of [aj]. I will accordingly transcribe the ISg pronoun as ey
when it functions as direct-object clitic, and as ay elsewhere. This is an idealization,
but aside from its approximation to phonetic reality it also provides useful
orthographic differentiation. Examples: ay bine 'as for me', ay kaa Ί came', ay naa
'my mother', ay doo 'at my house (chez moi)', but a kar ey 'she hit me'.
      Some Timbuktu speakers carefully retain Arabic pronunciations of loanwords such
as addawla 'reputation, prestige' and alwayli 'suffering'. The fully assimilated
pronunciations are addowla [adrowla] and alweyli [alwejli], and the fact that some
speakers do not assimilate them suggests that the prevailing neutralized two-way
system is vulnerable to re-splitting. On the other hand, there are other examples where
a recently arisen *ay or *awhas been adjusted to the synchronic pattern. Several stems
with original final *ab have participated in a lenition of *b to w, the resulting
diphthong being heard in most cases as [ow] rather than as [aw], as in algab ~ algow
'hawk sp.' (more examples in §3.10.1).
      However we choose to analyse the ey~ay diphthong, we should note that it has no
tendency to induce palatalization of a preceding velar stop.
      The basic diphthongal system of {oy ew ey~ay ow~aw} is subject to further
reduction when the preceding consonant constituting the onset of the syllable is either
w or a palatoalveolar from the set {c j n s z y}. First, consider what happens when
the onset and the coda are harmonic, as in the patterns wVw and PVy (P = any
palatoalveolar). Only ο is possible in wVw, as in wow 'insult' and wow 'become
healed', and only e is possible in PVy, as injey 'spend a long time' and yey 'become
cold'. Note that the nucleus in these examples is harmonic with the flanking
segments, ο being close to w and e being close to the palatoalveolars.
      Consider now the disharmonic flanking environments wVP and PVw, where the
onset and coda tend to pull the nucleus in opposite directions. Since only y among the
palatoalveolars may occur syllable- or word-finally, wVP in practice reduces to wYy.
The relevant wYy forms are transcribed woy 'woman' and its homophone woy 'ten',
as well as a few bisyllabic stems like woyme '(man's) sister' and woyne 'sun'. The
pronunciation is actually intermediate in both cases between [woj] and [wej] and might
be better represented as [woej], but since no phonemic distinction seems possible in
this environment there is no harm in normalizing the transcription.
                           3.4 Nasalized vowels and word-final nasal consonants      21     ForPVwwehavejow 'take', oow 'read, study', yow 'guest', and yow 'bull'. In
these cases we again find intermediate nuclei, e.g. wavering between [djow] and
[d3Ew] and perhaps best represented as [dsepw], but no phonemic distinctions seem
possible and we normalize the transcription to ow.
     Broadly speaking, the (Timbuktu) KCh system of short-nucleus diphthongs is
similar to that of KS, and different from that of DjCh and HS, which phonemically
distinguish ey from ay and ow from aw.","[34, 35, 36, 37]"
"     In (160c), the pronominal conjunction takes its regular, frozen form ay [nda ni] as
it would in any other syntactic position. It is then combined with Dat postposition se.
There is no trace of the special, irregular ISgDat and 2SgDat enclitic forms illustrated
in(160a-b).
     Constructions with conjoined possessor are typically ambiguous when the
possessed noun is singular. In (159c), '[his and my] house' is unambiguous; since
there is only one house, we infer that it belongs jointly to the two referents. However,
if we add PI yo to the end of (159c), giving '[his and my] houses', there is ambiguity
between a joint-ownership reading and a disjoint-ownership reading. If necessary, the
latter reading can be expressed unambiguously by separating the two implied
possessive relationships, as in (161).(161)         [ni      huu     di]      nda      [ay      huu        di]
              [2Sg     house Def]       and      [ISg     house      DefJ
              'your house and my house'
5.11.2 Conjunction of two full NPs, or of a pronoun and full NPIt is much easier to conjoin two full NPs (i.e. any NPs other than personal pronouns)
with nda, since the microsyntactic rules affecting pronominal conjunction do not apply
and since full NPs have no morphological distinction between subject and object cases.
Given two full NPs, A and B, either A nda Β οτ Β nda A is syntactically
grammatical. Of course, discourse factors will be involved in the left versus right
positioning of the two conjuncts, but there is no real syntactic issue here.
      There are some idioms with fixed order, as in tene nda aljaka 'good luck' (lit.
'forehead and luck').
      Extended nda strings with more than two conjuncts are possible, as in (162).(162)         yee maan^ndi                    [ay    dofor      di yo]
              ISgSImpf approach-Caus          [ISg cushion Def PI]
              nda [ay korkor di yo], ... nda [ay                  wane ndooso di]
              and [ISg crate        Def PI], ... and [ISg Poss pick-ax Def]
              nda [ay kubukubu] nda [ay               pellu       di]
              and [ISg machete]         and [ISg shovel          Def]
              Ί bring near (=gather) my padded (donkey) saddles, ... and my
               (donkey) crates, and my pick-ax, and my shovel.'
116     5 Nominal inflection and NP syntax     In theory, any such extended string allows for a range of bracketing possibilities as
the initial A [nda B] is expanded. With a third conjunct we could have A [nda [B [nda
C]] or [A [nda B]] nda C, depending on whether Z is directly conjoined to Υ or is
conjoined to the preceding conjunctive NP as a whole. With a fourth conjunct, as in
(162), the possibilities begin to increase exponentially. However, in (162) and in most
similar examples, the alternative bracketings have no effect on the truth conditions for
the overall sentence.
     When a pronoun is conjoined with an NP, the pronoun (which is presumably
always more topical) comes first, as in (163-64).(163)         [ay      [nda [boro di        yo]]] si           kuboy a          ra
              [ISg [and [person Def PI]]] ImpfNeg meet                  3Sg Loc

              [3P1F [and [rain       Def]]] Sp'oc Impf follow [with friend]
              'They (=God's reasons) and the rain follow each other (=are related).'","[131, 132]"
"
6.2.4 Minor uses of -ndiIn a few cases, a segmentable -ndi functions neither as factitive-causative nor as
mediopassive.
     In one case, -ndi acts as a denominal verbalizer: ciwsi ~ cipsi 'sacrificial ram'
(<Ar.), ciwsi-ndi 'slaughter (sacrificial ram)'.
     cerbu 'show' (cf. §6.1.4) and cerbu-ndi 'demonstrate, explain' are both
ditransitives. cerbu is preferred when a physical entity is shown (ostension), while
cerbu-ndi is preferred when an abstract matter is explained verbally.
     From cii 'speak' (intransitive or transitive) we get regular mediopassive cii-ndi 'be
said', pronounced [tfi(i)ndi] with vowel length unreliably expressed (§3.7.9). The very
common verb oindi 'remain, keep (doing)' is perhaps historically related to the
equational copula ci 'be', but both are intransitive.
     In addition to these grammatically unusual verbal examples, there are a few cases
where -ndi occurs in a derived noun, bita is the term for 'millet porridge' (a staple
food), while bita-ndi denotes another type of porridge made from millet pudding (local
Fr. to). In two cases, the noun is probably a zero nominalization (§4.3.2) of a verbal
derivative with -ndi. These are noo-ndi 'gift' (homophonous with mediopassive
noo-ndi 'be given') and waasu-ndi 'dish made with boiled meat' (homophonous with
causative waasu-ndi 'bring to a boil').
     The noun faraandi means 'quarter (section of city)'. The form suggests faraa
'fatigue' (noun) or 'be tired' and its causative faraa-ndi 'bother, weary', but there is no
obvious semantic link.
                                                      6.2 Derived voice forms      1376.2.5 Suffixation of -nda to verb stemIn §6.1.6 we discussed verbs which commonly take an instrumental-comitative
complement (nda 'with' plus NP), perhaps separated from the verb by an intervening
constituent. There are also some combinations where the -nda seems to act as a suffix
on the verb, creating a derived transitive. The two constructions can be schematized as
in (210a-b).(210)    a.   [subjectNP]        V          ...    [nda [NP]]
         b.   [subject NP]       V-nda      ...    [NP]     There is no clearly audible difference between (210a) and (210b) when no other
constituents intervene, but when there is such an intervening constituent the
distinction is clear. It is probable that the type (210b) is historically derived from
(210a) by redrawing of word boundaries. (210b) is typical of comitative function
('along with, together with'), whereas the instrumental function of ('by means of) is
normally expressed as (210a).
     The examples which we ascribe to (21 Ob), with derivational verb suffix -nda, are
given in (211). ""S"" and ""O"" denote the referents functioning as subject and direct
object, respectively, in the derived form.(211)         stem gloss                      derivative   gloss
         a.   koy    'S go'                   koy-nda      'S take O, deliver O'

              tilasu Ό be necessary'          tilasu-nda   'S need O'     Sentential examples showing other postverbal constituents (e.g. datives)
intervening between -nda and the direct object are given in (212).(212)    a.   ay     kaa-nda       mana      attee
              ISgS come-with 2SgDat tea
              Ί have brought some tea for you(Sg).'
         b.   yee         ta fey-nda           mana [ni        w nde di]

              ISgSImpf      resemble 3Sg Dat dog
              Ί resemble a dog for him (=from his point of view).'
138 6 Verbal voice and verb derivation      There are similar examples involving koy-nda, yee-nda, gey-nda, sawa-nda, and
 tilasu-nda. For kubey-nda I have no example of the type seen in (212), since with
object separated from verb by an intervening dative, informants preferred to use the
synonymous underived kubey.
      The fusion of -nda with the verb is strong in the case of the motion verbs in
(211 a). Note that in cases like 'S brings O', both subject and object are in most cases
jointly in motion. The apparent historical shift from 'S came [with O]' to 'S brought
O' is therefore straightforward and is known from many languages. The remaining
examples, lumped together in (2lib), are fairly diverse in type. Aside from the
smallish number of verbs affected, we notice considerable semantic divergence. In the
case of hima, the simple stem is a serial verb used in the Ought to' construction,
which has little connection to 'resemble'. Note that tilasu-nda has a different logical
relation to the corresponding simple stem than do the other examples.
      When a causative is made from VERB-nda Y, we get VERB-Caus X [nda Y],
where nda 'with' is liberated from the verb and forms an independent constituent with
its (comitative) complement NP, generally not immediately adjacent to the causative
verb. Compare kubey-nda 'encounter' in (21 Ib) with causative kuboy-ndi ... nda
 'cause to meet' in (213); cf. beginning of §5.11.3, above, (kubey and kuboy are
variants of the same stem.) The complement of nda has been extracted by
relativization in (213a), but this is irrelevant to the point at hand.(213)    a.   hay di kaa yerkoy kuboy-ndi_^ ey           [nda 17 ci woo yo

"     In (272a), the NP positions clearly coindexed with the focused constituent are in
the second and third clauses of a three-clause sequence ('we bend over, we look at
themx, we touch them x ') which functions en bloc as a conditional antecedent bound by
nda 'if. Note gi 'them' twice as a resumptive pronoun coindexed with the focused
constituent 'bits'. There is no clearly coindexed trace in the main clause ('we find that
small chunks are in it'), although one might argue adventurously that 'bits' occurs
                                                            8.1 Focus constructions    169logically in this clause in some way (On the basis of ...'). In (272b), the resumptive
pronoun 'it' is the subject of a 'that' clause subordinated to the verb 'notice'.
      There remains the question whether Foe morpheme na forms a constituent with
the preceding fronted constituent, serves as a complementizer introducing the
following core sentence, or has an independent syntactic status. In other words, is
English Beans I like or clefted It's beans that I like (with complementizer that) the
better syntactic parallel to the KCh na construction? I find it difficult to make this
decision on empirical rather than theory-internal grounds.
      In the focus construction, the fronted constituent and the core sentence are, in
general, tightly knit prosodically. There are occasional textual examples where one
detects a brief pause after na, but hesitations can also occur after that in English clefts
due to processing considerations, cf. the free translation of (272b). Examples like
(271) could be taken as evidence that na is bracketed with the preceding focalized
constituent, but only if we consider the material intervening between na and the trace-
containing clause as being completely outside the focalization construction. However,
it is preferable to bracket the type in (271) as 'NPX na [[we come] and [we share /, ]],'
with the 'come' and 'share' clauses fused together (cf. §9.5.2), in which case we have
no new information about how to bracket the na.
      If na formed a constituent with the focalized constituent, it would be reasonable to
expect the two to occur together in truncated replies to WH questions. But na cannot
surface after a bare focalized constituent. This is shown by the exchange in (273).","[184, 185]"

3.7.4 Contractions of vowels over an intervening semivowelThe sequences iyi and uwu are not contracted in measured speech: ije keyna di yiskan
'the child was quiet', cerbu wuraa X se 'show some gold to X'. Since these
sequences are the optimal ones for contraction, it is clear that contraction is not a
regular phonological process.
     However, the nearly homorganic sequences //eye// and //owo// are optionally
contracted at word boundaries when certain grammatical morphemes are involved. The
vowels belong by definition to different morphemes, but the semivowel may belong to
either the morpheme on the left (39a) or that on the right (39b).

             a nee^yer^ se       [ane:s:e]       'he(she) said to us'     Type (39a) is rare since the only native morphemes beginning in e or ο are ISgO
ey and Impf o. The Impf morpheme rarely follows a word (i.e., a subject NP) ending
in ow, and when it does it optionally takes the allomorph go. In ciiney^ ey, the double
underlying ey diphthong approaches tongue-twister difficulty and haplology may be
involved.
     Type (39b) is largely confined to combinations involving 1P1 yer and 2P1 wor,
e.g. as postverbal object. The preceding vowel may be long or short, yer sometimes
also contracts with a preceding aa or oo if the phrasing is fairly tight: goo^ yer^ doo
[ged:o:] 'be at our place'. On frozen contractions involving original demonstrative
*woo, see §3.7.5.
     The plural forms of certain bisyllabic pronouns constitute a special case. See §4.1
for a general treatment of personal pronouns. Of interest here are the forms
Logo/3ReflPl rjgu-yo - qgi-yoand 3P1F1 qgi-yo. These can be analysed as consisting of
Logo/3ReflSg rjgu or 3SgF rjga plus PI yo, but these high-frequency combinations are
rather frozen and are vulnerable to contractions. Leaving aside the ηg onset, which can
be reduced to η or palatalized (before /) to nj, I hear the remainder variously as uyo, iyo,
as uya, iya (or uye, iye) with loss of rounding in the final vowel, or as contracted ee.","[50, 51]"
"    In (437a), ni foo 'by yourself is a kind of delayed elaboration on the preverbal
2SgS pronoun, so it occurs finally. This leaves two other postverbal constituents, the
Dat PP a se 'to (for) it' and the indefinite direct object NP hin-ey 'mastery'.
Although the interpretation of the Dat PP is dependent on that of hin-ey, which would
seem to favor the ordering... hin-ey [a se]..., the preference for putting backgrounded
(especially pronominal) material first prevails, so we get ... [a se] hin-ey ... .
Likewise, in (437b), one might expect the direct object 'sheep' to follow the verb
immediately, on grounds of semantic bracketing, but instead the pronominal PP 'at
her place* intervenes. In both (437a) and (437b), with a pronominal PP preceding a
noun-headed direct object NP, informants strongly disapprove of the reverse ordering.
    One possible analysis is that a pronominal PP is enclitic to the verb. An
""enclitic"" is an unstressed morpheme (or morpheme string) which is attached to a
preceding full-fledged word. We could hypothesize that object pronominals and
pronominal PPs are cliticized to the verb, while full NPs (and full-NP-headed PPs)
cannot be. Consider now (438).

"    Each of (6-8) begins with a subject NP, which in (7-8) is a personal pronoun. The
MAN position is occupied by Impf o in (6), by zero in (7), and by Neg na in (8).
Except with equational and locational quasi-verbs, a zero MAN position is interpreted
as perfective positive, which is extremely common in past tense narrative. The verb
stem, here guna 'see', has no inflectional affixes for either pronominal agreement or
MAN categories. The direct object NP follows the verb (though not always
immediately), whether it is a pronoun as in (7) or a full NP as in (6,8). Further
constituents such as adverbial modifiers generally follow the direct object NP, as with
doodi 'there' in (6-7) and the Locative PP in (8). However, when a verb is followed by
two or more complements (NPs and PPs), their linear ordering reflects morphological
and discourse considerations as well as pure syntax.
    The maximal internal structure of a NP or PP is schematized in (9).(9)            possessor - noun - adjective - numeral - demonstrative - Definite -
                    Plural - DF[discourse-function] - postposition      Examples of this structure are (10-12).

be omitted after a possessive (as in the pattern: 'Which house? Mine, or my
father's?'). Possessor, adjective, and numeral are optional. In the defmiteness slot, the
choices are Def di and zero. In the plurality slot, the choices are PI yo and zero
(usually interpreted as singular). The DF slot may be filled by a topic, emphatic, or
similar morpheme. In the final position, there are several nonzero postpositions such
as Dative se and Locative kuna. Subject and direct object NPs have zero case, and may
be said informally to be in the Nominative. Some adverbial modifiers like nee 'here'
can be analysed as zero case forms of (defective) nouns.
     Personal pronouns can, of course, be used as NPs, but they do not fit neatly into
the schema (9). For example, the (third person) logophoric plural pronoun has a
discernible (but often phonologically altered) PI ending yo, as in (13). Any pronoun
can take a DF morpheme, a postposition, or both (14).(13)           qgi-yo          (pronounced [rjgijo], [rjgije], [nge:], etc.)

and focus constructions, relative clauses, and complement clauses (reported speech,
subjunctive, serial verbs).
     Topic constituents (usually NPs) are usually preposed and set off from the
sentence proper by a pause. In this preposed position, they optionally take a Topic
morpheme. One common Topic morpheme is bine (also a noun 'heart'), often in
contrastive-topic function. A preposed topical NP often corresponds to a pronoun (in
any syntactic function or position) in the sentence proper, as in (15).(15)             [[ay      baaba]       bine],       ay          guna      ga

5.8.1 Focus (Foe na and SFoc rjga)Focalized constituents (as we use the term here) are always fronted to a position
preceding the remainder of the clause. This is most obvious with constituents that are
otherwise postverbal, such as direct objects and adpositional complements. Since
subjects are clause-initial anyway, their focalization does not produce an obvious
""fronting,"" but one can argue nonetheless that fronting occurs here too.
     The usual markers of focalization are Subject Focus (SFoc) qga, inserted
obligatorily between a focalized subject and the following material (MAN morphemes,
then VP), and non-subject Focus (Foe) na, which can be omitted under some
conditions but is usually present after an NP (or adverbial) fronted from post-verbal
position. Simple examples are in (129).(129)    a. ay          ijga      gar       ga
            ISg         SFoc      find      3SgO
            'It is I [focus] who found it.' (subject focus)
         b. maa            na     no-o                taasi
            what?          Foe    2SgS-Impf           seek
            'What [focus] are you looking for?' (nonsubject focus)   For fuller discussion of the syntax, see §8.1.1-2. Historically, na reflects a weak
demonstrative *no 'there' and is therefore related etymologically to identificational
                                                5.5 Markers of discourse status       101quasi-verb nono 'it is', §7.1.1. (KS has no as both a focalizer and a reduced 'there'
demonstrative.) SFoc rjga is intriguingly homophonous to 3SgF pronoun rjga (§8.4.2).
There is considerable variation in the form of SFoc morphemes throughout the KCh-
DjCh-KS zone, permitting speakers of each dialect to make different morphemic
associations (with attendant ""deep"" syntactic analysis) for the SFoc marker.
     It is doubtful that either na or rjga forms a surface constituent, strictly speaking,
with the preceding focalized constituent. If it did, one would expect that the particle
would occur as part of truncated WH questions ('who?') and as part of truncated replies
to WH questions (Q: 'What did you find?'; A: ""The dog'). However, na and rjga are
never used in this way; the truncated interrogative or reply consists simply of the
focalized interrogative pronoun or NP. The truncated form of (129b) is maa 'what?',
not #maa na, and that of (129a) is ay T, not #ay rjga.
     NPs (and PPs) are not the only constituents that can be, in principle, focalized.
VPs can be focal (Q: 'What did you do?'; Α: Ί cried'), as can truth values ('Yes I did
see him'). However, in KCh there is no overt grammatical marking of verb, VP, or
truth-value focus. In practice, ""focus"" applies to NPs, PPs, and adverbials like 'here'
and 'today' which can be analysed as reduced or defective NPs.","[116, 117]"
"     A semantically expected Loc postposition and Def di are often omitted with nouns
functioning as spatiotemporal adverbials (e.g. 'there', 'tomorrow'), and with certain
high-frequency nouns denoting socially significant zones, such as yoobu 'market' and
ganji 'wilderness' (§5.12).
     Cognates of ra are DjCh la and KS ra (la after a nasal or liquid), and the
postposition may be ancient. Locative postpositions usually derive historically from
nouns meaning 'place', 'interior', or the like, but I can identify no specific noun stem
as the likely etymological source for these forms. If *ra is original, we should look for
a noun roughly of the shape *CVra, since tap *r does not otherwise occur morpheme-
initially in native Songhay vocabulary. If *la is the older variant this consideration
does not apply, laabu 'earth, soil' (KS labu) is perhaps a candidate, but it does not
mean 'place'.
     With kuna we have better luck. KCh itself has a frozen compound haw-kuna
'belt' including haw 'tie'. (Cf. KS kuna-haw 'belt' and HS kun-haw verb 'tie belt
on'.) KCh also has a reduplicated noun kuna-kuna '(the) very bottom (of pit, well,
etc.)', and a frozen instrumental phrase nda kuna 'internally, on the inside' (§5.11.4).
These forms, and perhaps the verb kun 'be pregnant' suggest an original meaning
complex for *kun(a) on the order of 'deep interior, middle, womb, midsection, waist'.
The bleaching of such a noun into a Loc adposition is natural.
106     5 Nominal inflection and NP syntax5.9.5 ga On, by, from, out ofga has a short vowel in KCh. It is therefore clearly distinct from preverbal Presentative
morpheme gaa (§7.2.3) and from the clause-final Emphatic gaa (<Arabic, §8.5.7).
    The core sense of ga is probably On'. However, it can be translated as 'by,
alongside' or 'from, out of depending on the verb. It is also used, with a locational
quasi-verb 'be', to indicate temporary possession or custody. For more details on the
semantic range, see §11.1.2. Examples in (142).(142)     a.   yee             kar     [a      ga]      guusu
                ISgSImpf       hit     [3Sg    by]      hole
               Ί knock (=make) a hole in it (stone).'
          b.   no-o            bisa      [a    ga]
               2SgS-Impf       pass      [3Sg by]
               'You'll pass by it (limestone).'
          c.   nda      a        gar     [kuumu goo^ ay        ga]
               if       3SgS find [hoe             exist ISg by]
               'if it happens that a hoe is on me (=in my possession)'     Being sensitive to verbal semantics, ga is prone to selection as a complement by
particular verbs (§6.1.4). It has cognates in several other Songhay languages, and is
perhaps derived historically from *gaa 'body'.
5.9.6 doo 'chez, at (the place of)'The other postposition calling for special commentary is doo 'at (the place of)'. It is
often used like French chez in the specific sense 'at the house of, but it can also mean
'in the presence of (someone)' with no necessary reference to dwellings, and 'in the
vicinity of (something)' with nonhuman complement. Examples in (143).(143)     a.   saa    kaa     wor         too      [alhoor-fiaa        di      doo]
               time Rel you(Pl) arrive [limestone-mother Def                   chez]
               'when you have arrived in the vicinity of the large limestone block'
          b.   yer    ο         koy [mobil-koy             di    ye doo]
               1P1S Impf        go      [vehicle-boss     Def PI chez]
               'We (will) go to the place where the vehicle owners (drivers) are.'","[121, 122]"
"
9.5.3 Juxtaposed clauses in adverbial function ('while', 'without')When two clauses are juxtaposed, the second sometimes functions as a temporal
adverbial clause translatable as 'while' (if positive) or 'without' (if negative), as in
(501). 'While' is to be taken in its temporal (= 'during') rather than adversative sense
(= 'whereas'). Note that 'without knowing' is logically equivalent to 'while not
knowing', so the 'while' is consistent.(501)    a.   ammaa [saa di kaa] a                 kar,
              but      [time Def Rel] 3SgS hit,
              [a       kar] [hew        sii^    [a      ra]]
              [3SgS hit]      [wind be^not [3Sg Loc]]
              'But when it (=rain) struck, it struck while there was no wind.'
         b.   [no-o         bisa [a ga]] [ni           si        bey]
              [2SgS-Impf pass [3Sg by]] [2SgS ImpfNeg know]
              'You'll pass by it without knowing'     This type of construction normally consists of an initial clause denoting a
foregrounded event, followed by a brief second clause denoting a temporally extended
state or process that is not caused by the first event. The best way to make sense of
such a combination is to infer that the second clause denotes a background situation
whose temporal interval contains that of the event denoted by the first clause. The
second clause is most often in imperfective aspect. It can, however, be in the
unmarked perfective aspect, for example when this clause is negated, as in (648a-b) in
§10.2.4.
     There is no overt morpheme meaning precisely 'while ...'. Both saa di kaa ...
'when ..., (at) the time that...' and nda ... 'if (when) ...' are strongly associated with
temporal sequence rather than overlap. The only obvious alternative to (501a), then, is
272     9 Sentence-level syntax and semanticsto invert the order (""There was no wind; the rain struck'). In the case of 'without',
there is an alternative construction involving bilaa 'without' (<Ar.) and a subjunctive
clause, see §9.6.4.
     When two juxtaposed clauses are both imperfective, they may be fused in
somewhat the same way as in (501), but it is not always the case that the second
clause functions as an adverbial modifier of the first. Consider (502).(502)         yee       kaa     ta hää ga         [wala [addeliil foo  ga]
              ISgSImpf come Inf ask 3SgO [or            [reason which? on]
              [yee        sallam [a ga]] [a        si        tuuri]]
              [ISgSImpf greet       [SSgon]] [3SgS ImpfNeg reply]]
                 was coming to ask him^, for which reason (=why) did hex not
               respond when I greeted himx.'","[287, 288]"
"
4.7 Reduplication of noun and adjective stemsReduplication is not a common process with nouns. In the following examples, the
sense of the unreduplicated stem is given after the ""<"" symbol. As with verbs (§6.4),
bisyllabic stems are favored. In one set of forms, the reduplication has clear distributive
value: oinne-dinne 'co-tribesmen' <'peer', guuru-guuru 'spare auto parts' <'(piece of)
metal', jiibt-jiibi 'dirty spots' <'dirt', jombu-jombu 'fragments, debris' <'broken-up
grains', tombi-tombi 'spots, stains' <'spot'. In two cases, reduplication is used as an ad
hoc derivational device defining one entity in terms of a better-known one: kooro-kooro
'hooked device for retrieving bucket fallen into well' <kooro 'hyena'; fendu-fendu
'cross-beam' <fendu 'winnowing van'. Nominal reduplication kaari-kaari 'maximum,
utmost' is only dubiously connected to kaari 'wait for' (perhaps DjCh kaari 'give
freely to, donate to' reflects the relevant original simple form), boyboy 'pits dug in
drying marsh to collect water' may be connected to boy '(finger-)nail' or to the verb
boy 'drive, herd', dugu-dugu 'teal' is dubiously related to dugu 'incense'.
     There are quite a few noun stems which appear to be frozen reduplications, the
simple stem being unattested. A few examples: birimbirim 'a cultivar of sorghum',
bitibiti 'mist', kusukusu 'couscous', lumbalumba 'vine sp.', totjgotorjgo 'bow
(weapon)', warawara 'coarse sieve'.
     Verbs (especially bisyllables) are reduplicated more frequently than nouns (§6.4).
Since most ""adjectives"" are suffixal derivatives of intransitive verbs, it is not surprising
that bisyllabic adjectives can be reduplicated in distributive (cf. §5.4.4) or intensive
sense. Examples are dumb-odumb-o 'meager (bits)' and keyna-keyna 'just a little'.
The form mooso-mooso 'slowly, softly, gently' is much more common than the
simple mooso (same gloss).
     The adverb gumo-gumo 'extremely', cf. gumo 'right(-handed)', is attested
dialectally but is rare in Timbuktu.

                    Nominal inflection and NP syntax
5.1 Overview
In the previous chapter we introduced the morphemic material of NPs and examined
processes of noun-stem formation. In the present chapter we focus on the larger NP
syntax and on the analysis of relevant grammatical categories.
     The simplest NPs are personal pronouns (§4.A), which take no further marking for
definiteness or plurality. In this chapter, however, we are concerned chiefly with ""full
NPs"" headed by a lexical noun, or by another stem capable of functioning as NP head.
The latter set includes adjectives or numerals converted into NP heads by means of the
Absolute prefix a- or i- (§4.4.3, §4.5.1), demonstrative pronoun woo, and possessive
phrases with postposition wane. A ""full NP"" is any NP not consisting of a personal
pronoun.
     The maximal structure of an NP (or PP), excluding relative clause modification, is
that shown in (92).(92)          {                  coreNP                  } post-core elements
              possessor - N - Adj - Num - Dem - Def - PI - kul - DF - Postp     The ""core"" of a full NP consists of the lexical information necessary to specify the
denoted referent. This core NP is syntactically equivalent to a personal pronoun. Either
the core of a full NP, or a personal pronoun, may be followed by any of the post-core
elements: kul 'all'; a DF (discourse-functional) morpheme such as Top[ic] or
Emph[atic] (also Only' or 'also'); or a postposition. The position of kul is more
variable than indicated in (92), and it can follow DF morphemes under some
conditions. If a postposition is present, the entire phrase is a PP (postpositional
phrase).
     The lexical head is the noun in the second position of (92). It is preceded by a
possessor NP, which itself contains an NP. The head N may be followed by a
modifying adjective, a numeral, the demonstrative pronoun woo 'this, that', Def di, and
PI yo. All the positions except the noun are optional.
     Even the noun may be omitted if there is another element present that is capable of
carrying the basic information (possessor, adjective, numeral, or demonstrative). When
a possessor NP, adjective, or numeral functions as head of the NP in the absence of N,
certain morphological restrictions and adjustments apply (§5.2.3, §5.3.1, §5.4.1).
     A few examples of NPs headed by nouns or demonstrative woo are given in (93).
Post-core elements are included in the NP with universal quantifier (93d) and in the PPs
(93e-f), one of which (93f) has a DF morpheme before the postposition.

5.2 Possessives5.2.1 Possessor NPs with and without waneA possessive NP has the form [[NP (wane)] N ...], where N is the possessed noun (and
hence the lexical head of the larger NP). The possessor NP (which can be a simple
pronoun or a multi-word NP) can be followed by the Possessive postposition wane
(§5.9.3). Examples in (94).(94)      a.   a          wane       gaabi         di
               3Sg        Poss       strength Def
               'its power'
          b.   [isa here          woo yo wane] fari di         yo
               [river around Dem PI Poss] field Def PI
               'fields of (=in) those river areas'
          c.   [alhoor       di         daa      wane] ciini di     yo
               [limestone Def           Emph Poss] word      Def    PI
               'words of (=about) limestone*    However, wane is optional and may be omitted in each of (94a-c). Omission of
wane in (94a) causes no interpretive problems since the 3Sg pronoun in a gaabi di
can only be construed as possessive; likewise, ISg ay in (95a) must be possessive.
                                                                    5.2 Possessives   85When the possessor is a full noun-headed NP, omission of wane results in the
juxtaposition of two NPs, so possession may be indistinguishable from loose
compounding (§4.6.5). However, possessive and compounding readings are not always
semantically distinct, and if the possessed noun is semantically inalienable ('mother',
 'belly') the construction can safely be read as possessive, as with 'mother' in (95b).(95)     a.   ay^        naa
              ISg        mother
              'my mother'
         b.   [har     di       yo]      naa           di
              [man     Def      PI]      mother        Def
              'the men's mother'     Note that the possessor and possessed NPs are independently marked for
definiteness and for grammatical number both in (94b-c) with wane and in (95b)
without it.
     When the possessed ""noun"" is really a numeral or adjective beginning in Absolute
i- or a-, and the possessor is 3Sg a or 3P1 i, omission of wane is uncommon. The
strong preference for overt wane in this combination can be viewed as a device to avoid
a VV sequence whose contraction would obliterate categorial information. Thus a
wane^ i boyro di 'its best' (i.e., 'the best thing for it') rather than ?#a i-boyro di.
There is no problem with pronominal possessors ending in consonants: yer a-woy
Our ten'.","[98, 99, 100, 101]"
"     One way to analyse (247-49) is to posit a phonologically unrealized low-content
(""light"") verb DO or BE. This would work fairly well in (247-48), where haya foo
and maa, respectively, could be taken as postverbal direct objects. However, the
analysis would not work in (249). In both (249a) and (249b), 3SgO ga is clearly the
direct object, and as an enclitic pronominal must directly follow the verb (§9.1.1).
There is no way to insert a DO verb into (249a-b) and produce a grammatical sentence.
Therefore we must take the 'whatchamacallit?' word as a verb, not as an NP following
a phonologically unexpressed verb.
     One might compare the verb-like use of the ordinarily nominal haya foo, maa,
and haya-jje with the use of original morphological nominalizations diya-terey and
seede-terey as verbs, see (87f) in §4.6.4, above.",[170]
"     In all asymmetrical comparative expressions found in my data, the first
comparandum A (i.e., the subject) is the one that exceeds the second comparandum B.
That is, they are all of the form Ά surpasses Β' (Ά is or does ... more than B'). There
is no (nonnegative) construction in common use which reverses the relationship (Ά is
or does ... less than B'); the speaker simply switches subjects and says 'B is or does ...
more than A.' This switch is illustrated in (609), the fuller textual passage containing
(604), above. ""Ol,"" ""O2,"" and ""O3"" represent mutually exclusive options.(609)       aywa attey woo nda —, moreyda n                      jaraa-ndi ga

                                              9.7 Infinitival VPs and serial verbs     319     The three options are of the schematic types (ΟΙ) Ά is more than Β,' (Ο2) Ά
equals B,' and (O3) Ά is less than B.' In English, the sequence could be expressed
without changing the order of the comparanda, facilitating syntactic reduction: 'should
the flavor of the sugar be more than, equal to, or less than that of the tea leaves?' In
KCh, however, the O3 option requires reversal of the ordering ('B is more than A') if
the bisa construction is adhered to.
     Another option for Ά is less than B' is a main-clause negation plus an attached
infinitival VP with too 'attain, reach, be the equal of, as in (610). Note that the
infinitival VP is included in the scope of the negative, otherwise the translation would
be Ί equal him in (extent of) not eating.'(610)         ay     si        gaa      [ka too          ga]

              Ί do not equal him in eating'. (= Ί eat less than he [does].')     The more basic function of this verb too 'attain' is to express equality of the two
comparanda in some respect, but another verb sawa 'be equal* is also possible, too in
egalitarian comparative contexts is strictly a transitive verb, but sawa without further
derivation is intransitive. Therefore the construction with too is of the type 'X equal Υ
(in ...)' (61 la), while that with sawa is of the type 'X and Υ be equal (in ...)' or, with
the two comparanda merged into a plural, *theyxy be equal (in ...)' (61 Ib). However,
sawa can be transitivized by adding -nda 'with' as a derivational suffix (§6.2.5),
resulting in a construction syntactically parallel to that with too (61 Ic).(611)    a. yee          too     ga         gaabi
