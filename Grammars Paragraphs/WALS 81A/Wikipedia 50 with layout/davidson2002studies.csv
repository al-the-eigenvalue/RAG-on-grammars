4.4 Basic clause structure
4.4.1   RP functions and constituent orderIn addition to the predicate, a clause can (but need not) contain referring expressions that functionas subjects and objects, or in oblique roles. Referring expressions are expressed syntactically asreferring phrases (RPs) (§4.5). The predicate usually comes first in the clause followed by thecore (i.e. subject and object) RPs in either order. There is no case-marking or other overt meansof indicating which RP is subject, and which is object.","[124, 125]"

4.3.3   Other cliticsThus far we have seen clitics expressing mood, pronominals, and tense. These belong to a largerset of clitics that may occur in the predicate. When more than one occurs on the same word in thepredicate, they are strictly ordered. Although the order differs somewhat for the two languages,clitics in both may be divided into three groups based on their sequencing requirements: pre-modal clitics, mood and pronominal clitics, and post-modal clitics. Pre-modal clitics precedemood clitics. Among them we find the following (only a single allomorph of each is shown):
                                                 106(174)      Selected pre-modal clitics           Intentive Future: N <F`9pQ (§7.3.2)           Causative: M, N <""`o           Temporal Specifier (‘now, then, at that time’): M, N <""`Q (§7.3.3)           Passive-inverse: M <""hs, N <""`s (§4.4.2, §7.3.5)           Possessive: M, N <tj (§7.3.4)           Tense: including past M<(a)hs, N <(l)hs and hypothetical future M <""dxhj, N <""h9jCo-occurrence restrictions and relative ordering of these clitics are discussed at §7.5. Some ofthe clitics in (174) are briefly discussed elsewhere in this chapter, e.g. see §4.4.2 for the passive-inverse.","[121, 122]"
    The order of Nuuchahnulth clitics is shown in (485).,[337]

"N ,bG` [L] go in order to ...; go in connection with ...",[375]
    The alternations are presented in order of application to underlying forms except that theautomatic alternations in §3.2 are ordered after the morpheme-specific alternations in §3.3 eventhough they are described first for expository reasons. The important issue of vowel-length alter-nations is discussed apart from the other alternations in §3.1. Only alternations of some generalityare discussed individually in this chapter; those that are restricted to a few morphemes or arerarely encountered are introduced as necessary.,[43]

5.8 SpecializationDerived words vary widely in spontaneity of composition and degree of lexicalization. Speakersare capable of using the principles of derivation we have discussed in this chapter to spontane-ously produce and interpret new words, but many derived words must be considered elements ofthe permanent mental lexicon, that is, words that are learned as units by speakers during thecourse of language acquisition and not derived anew for each use. The clearest indication of thisis specialization of meaning. Derived words frequently have meanings more specific than themeanings of their component parts would suggest. Examples are legion. The Nuuchahnulth wordFHGsTo (FHGi ‘big’ + ,(R)sTo ‘... species’) literally means ‘big sort, species of thing’ but nowdenotes only ‘whale’. The literal force of the component morphemes (‘big’ and ‘... species’) hasbeen lost, as shown by the fact that one can say ‘big whale’ by modifying the derived word withone of its own components: FHG FHGsTo ‘a big whale’ (NA 149.47). Similarly, N bhY`r (bhp,‘speak’ + -""`r ‘go in order to ...’) literally means ‘go in order to speak’, but it is now specialized

Derived words with specializedmeanings are commonly used for names of flora and fauna, tools, ceremonies, personal names,and place names, e.g.","[230, 231]"

The class of particles includes imperative particles, inter-jections, and syntactic particles. See Swadesh (1933: 20-23, 1939: 80-81) for more informa-tion.114    The degree of grammatical differentiation among word classes in Southern Wakashan is fa-mously low.115 Words are sometimes said to be polyfunctional (e.g. Rose 1981: 10, who, referringto Kyuquot, speaks of “the extreme degree of constituent multipurposeness of lexical entries”),but according to the conception of Southern Wakashan syntax developed in Chapter 4, this char-acterization is a bit misleading. Referring phrases (RPs), the syntactic realization of referring ex-pressions, are claimed to be headless relative clauses or “nominalized” clauses, where “nominal”is understood to mean “referring expression”.116 This goes hand-in-hand with the idea that all fullwords (except proper names) are predicative, as Swadesh (1933, 1939) proposed early on. Hence,the difference between (common) nouns and verbs is not in their ability to function in differentgrammatical roles, for there is only one major syntactic role in Southern Wakashan, predicate

The words in a multi-word nominal predicate head areusually strictly ordered: quantifier/numeral > property > noun. Clitics must occur on the firstword of the head. Example (210) shows two multi-word nominal predicates; the predicated ex-pression in (210)a is M FhFHWi PhcHQ ‘big dog’ and, in (210)b, it is N QtK g`Ftl ‘good food’.","[143, 144]"
"    Chapter One introduces the Southern Wakashan family and describes the nature of the pre-sent study, explaining how the dissertation came to be written, the corpus used in the study, andprevious literature on Southern Wakashan. Chapter Two summarizes Southern Wakashan seg-mental phonology with a presentation of the Nuuchahnulth consonant and vowel inventories, ba-sic allophonic processes, ablaut patterns, and discussion of the special behavior of nasals whenthey appear in syllable codas. The accent systems of the two languages are also briefly describedand compared. Chapter Three, Phonological Alternations, describes a variety of alternations trig-gered by affixation, including glottalization and lenition of final base segments by affixes, altera-tions to the CV skeleton of bases required by affixes, and, in Makah, widespread patterns ofvowel insertion and loss. Chapter Four is a grammatical sketch of Southern Wakashan dividedinto sections on word classes, morphology (word structure, lexical suffixes, and aspect), predicatestructure, basic clause structure (referring phrase functions, constituent order, clause types), refer-ring phrases, and complex constructions. Chapter Five examines the recursive polysynthetic wordstructure more closely. Chapter Six presents the aspect system. Chapter Seven, Clitics, describes

Chapter Eightargues that, although word classes are very weakly grammaticalized in Makah and Nuuchahnulth,distributional evidence is available for distinguishing nouns (and other nominal subcategories)from verbs. It goes on to show many examples of nominals and verbs in each of their possiblesyntactic contexts. Lists of lexical suffixes in Makah and Nuuchahnulth and selected Makah vo-cabulary are provided in two appendices.

1 IntroductionThis dissertation is a description of major features of Southern Wakashan (Nootkan) grammarusing data from two languages, Makah and Nuuchahnulth (formerly called Nootka).1 Because thedissertation is descriptive in intent and written for a general linguist audience rather than prac-tioners of a particular linguistic theory, no specific grammatical formalism or framework is em-ployed. Southern Wakashan does, however, raise various issues of theoretical import, and, at ap-propriate points, theoretical implications are considered. The grammatical concepts and terminol-ogy used in the description are generally vernacular among linguists, apart from those specific tothe Southern Wakashan descriptive tradition; these are defined as necessary.","[15, 16, 17]"
"Hence, it is not always clear which non-subject RPs are objects and which are adjuncts. For ex-ample, on the face of it, it is unclear whether the instrumental participants in the Nuuchahnulthexamples in (203)a-c (‘club’, ‘stick’, ‘cedar-limb lines’) are objects in some type of ditransitiveconstruction or adjuncts. (See §4.5 for a more common way of expressing instrumentals.)(203)       NUUCHAHNULTH

The most obvious behavioral property of RPs to test iswhether they can become passive subject. Another is their ability to precede the predicate head,which appears to be possible only for core RPs (Rose 1981).

In this dissertation, word class terms like nounand verb refer to classes of lexemes. To claim that M PhcHQ ‘dog’ is a noun and PhcHQRhQ ‘be-come a dog’ is a verb is therefore also to claim that the perfective aspect suffix is changing thelexeme class of the base.120 The power to change lexeme class is generally seen as a property ofderivational, rather than inflectional morphemes. According to such a conception of the inflec-tional/derivational distinction, it would seem that Southern Wakashan aspect must be consideredderivational. Further support for this idea comes from the frequent occurrence of aspect beforeaffixes that would seem uncontroversially derivational, as in the Makah noun

"    Southern Wakashan mood clitics express a varied set of modal, evidential, and speech-actcategories. Most of these are in paradigmatic opposition, but a few may co-occur to form moodcombinations (§7.2.3). Mood clitics include the Indicative illustrated above for both languages,the Purposive M, N <""`9 ‘in order that’, interrogative moods used to form both yes/no and con-tent questions, the Conditional M <pdx(t), N <pt9 ‘if, when; would’, the Nuuchahnulth Dubi-tative <p@E` ‘perhaps’, and the Subordinate M <W, <p`9, N <p@, which forms that-clausecomplements of predicates of saying, thinking, etc. as well as causal (‘because’) clauses, and, inMakah, ‘when’ clauses (in conjunction with Ftxt ‘when’). There are also several evidentialmoods in both languages, including the Quotative M <v`9s, <v`9c`, N <vDFhm and inferen-tial moods. The Makah Relative <(p)hj, <(p)h and Nuuchahnulth Definite Relative <FHsp andIndefinite Relative <(x)h9 moods form relative clauses.

5 Topics in Word Structure5.1 Formal structureAccording to a traditional morphological classification of languages,67 Southern Wakashan is aclassic example of a language family with polysynthetic word structure. Though definitions vary,a major criterion for polysynthetic status in most accounts is a high average number of mor-phemes per word. An important corollary is that a significant portion of these must be “lexical”,rather than grammatical in nature; that is, they should have meanings typically expressed by in-dependent lexical items in other languages. These morphemes might include incorporated nounsand adverbs, or semantically rich affixes like locative suffixes. Such features permit polysyntheticlanguages to have words with complex internal structure that often correspond semantically toentire sentences in less morphologically elaborate languages.68 True to type, words in SouthernWakashan can be internally complex with numerous morphemes and multiple hierarchic levels ofstructure packed into a single derivative.69    Southern Wakashan word structure can be described by the diagram in Figure 2, a moredetailed version of Figure 1 given previously in Chapter 4.70 The major structural division fallsbetween the unextended word (base + suffixes) and the extended word level (unextended word +clitics). Important formal differences exist between the two. The sequence of clitics has template-like organization with a fixed number of slots, flat structure, strict requirements on linear order of          Figure 2.

In contrast, there is no limitin principle to the number of suffixes that can be added to a base, and the order of suffixes canoften be changed to produce changes in meaning, as demonstrated by the following example setfrom Swadesh (1939: 86):(254)        NUUCHAHNULTH

Use of clitics has been briefly described in §4.3 andis more fully covered in Chapter 7.","[174, 175, 176, 177]"

"    The word in (275)b demonstrates an entirely different grammatical relationship between suf-fix and base. Unlike ,Ch, the suffix ,BT ‘in a container’ does not determine the class of the resul-tant word, which remains a noun; it adds information about the base and limits or restricts its de-notation, much as an adjective or relative clause limits the denotation of an English noun: theword’s potential referent is not only a pack-basket, but a pack-basket that is in a container.

8.2.2   Numerals, quantity words, and quantifiersWords in this class are easily distinguished from other nominal classes by their semantics, butalso by their ability to take enumerative suffixes (e.g. M, N ,Bhp ‘... many long, thin objects),which words of other classes (with sporadic exceptions) cannot.

"    Nominals        Nouns        Numerals, quantities, and quantifiers        Pronouns and demonstratives    Verbs    Predicate modifiersThe division between the major classes of nominal and verb rests on the syntactic fact (firstpointed out by Jacobsen 1979a) that nominals may occur as single-word referring phrases (RPs),the Nootkan equivalent of a noun phrase, while verbs may do so only when accompanied by theenclitic article M <?hp, N <FH (§4.5, §7.2.21). In Makah, the classes are further distinguishedby the fact that only nominals may occur with possessive enclitics like <rhr first singular posses-sive ‘my’ (cf. Jacobsen 1979a: 140). The various nominal subclasses are distinguished from eachother by morphological and syntactic criteria laid out in Chapter 8. Unlike words of the otherclasses, predicate modifiers may not function as predicate heads (§4.3.4).",[107]
"    Use of language internal criteria can be demonstrated by considering the status of two osten-sibly similar Nuuchahnulth suffixes, ,Ch ‘at, in ...’ and ,BT ‘in a container’. At first glance, onemight think to group these together as “locative” suffixes. However, closer study of their seman-tic relationship with bases and their effect on the grammatical category of the resultant wordshows that, according to Nootkan logic, they actually belong to different categories. Consider(275), which shows each suffix with the simple noun root p`FTb ‘pack-basket’ as base.

"    As will be evident throughout the present chapter, the degree of grammatical differentiationamong word classes is quite low. Consequently, researchers have debated whether Southern Wa-

Most(e.g. Swadesh 1933, 1939, Sapir & Swadesh 1939, Renker 1987, Nakayama 1997a) have arguedthat they should not be, while others (e.g. Jacobsen 1979a, Rose 1981) disagree. In this disserta-tion I accept the claim that the distributional differences one finds do justify word classes inSouthern Wakashan. See §8.1 for discussion.","[107, 108]"

4.2 MorphologyMakah and Nuuchahnulth are polysynthetic languages making extensive use of suffixation, in-cluding enclisis. Reduplicative prefixation, used to form plurals and express aspectual distinc-tions, is also important. These are the only morphological techniques, apart from a few plural in-fixes and some aspectually significant changes in vowel length. Reduplication and changes invowel length are also used to create special base forms required by some affixes (§3.3.1). There isno prefixation (apart from reduplicative prefixes), compounding, or noun incorporation.46
4.2.1   Word structureA full word (as opposed to a particle) has the structure shown in Figure 1. The structure issimplified for expository purposes; a slightly more complex description is given in Chapter 5. Allfull words (e.g. nouns, verbs, etc.) have the same structure.",[108]
"1
  Makah is the usual English rendering of the Clallam (a neighboring Salish language) designa-
tion for the tribe. In their own language, the Makah call themselves pihchCC`F@sW and their lan-
guage piHpiHchCC`p. Both words are regular formations based on the root pihchCC`,p,, a place
designation of uncertain reference (Renker & Gunther 1990: 429). The question of an appropriate
name for the other language appearing in the dissertation is difficult. The traditional name in the
anthropological and linguistic literature, Nootka, is not of native origin and disliked by the
community. In 1978, the Southern Wakashan people of Canada adopted the name Nuu-chah-nulth
(mTC@MtK ‘mountain range’) (Arima & Dewhirst 1990: 410). However, as an ethnonym, this
name actually subsumes peoples speaking two languages, those speaking the language formerly
referred to as Nootka and those speaking the closely related Nitinaht or Ditidaht. I follow Naka-
yama (1997a, see especially p. 2) in using Nuuchahnulth in a restricted sense as a linguistic des-
ignation to refer only to the language formerly known as Nootka. Note that I simplify the spelling
by eliminating the hyphens. Ditidaht is referred to as such.
2
  Makah has not been used as a medium of daily communication for decades, and, at the time of
writing, there were only three fluent speakers, all elderly.
3
  Interestingly, in phoneme charts given in his M.A. and Ph.D. dissertations (1931: 10, 1933: 4),
Swadesh did group /F/ and /Y/ with the glottalized consonants. The latter work agrees with Nootka
Texts in grouping the affricates with the stops, but the former has them listed separately.
4
  Sapir and Swadesh refer to them as “voiced continuants”; Rose and Nakayama call them “reso-
nants”.
                                                 350
5
   Sapir and Swadesh label the “Mid” row “Mid-wide”, the “Central” column “Back”, and the
“Back” column “Back Rounded”.
6
   This, incidentally, is the reason Sapir & Swadesh (1939) represent the high back vowels with
the symbol ‘o’, rather than ‘u’. The mid back vowels are represented by them with open o. Ac-
cording to Sapir & Swadesh (1955: 4), by the time Nootka Texts was in press, Sapir had decided
‘u’ was more appropriate. This has been the standard symbol for the high back vowels since Sapir
& Swadesh (1955).
7
  A syllable consists of an obligatory onset consonant followed by a single nuclear vowel, long or
short. The coda may contain zero, one, or more consonants (Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 13, Stonham
1994a: 76). Consequently, a nasal (or any other consonant, for that matter) is in the coda if it im-
mediately precedes another consonant, or occurs in word-final position.
8
   In early works, Sapir wrote the murmur vowel with either ‘i’, e.g. ,pElhK ‘round thing’ in
(1911a: 16) (-phlK in current orthography) and hmhjv,hgk ‘fire in the house’ in (1921) (FhmjihK in
current orthography), or with ‘i’, e.g. ""ιmhj# ‘fire’ in (1924).
9
  [L] indicates the suffix requires the first vowel of its base to be long. See §3.3.1. The colon dia-
critic is explained in §3.1.
10
    This rule correctly places primary accent in Makah, but there may be secondary accent at work
as well since there are sometimes perceived prominences in addition to the primary accent, espe-
cially on long vowels. It is unclear whether these are merely phonetic correlates of vowel length
or part of the accent system. Accent in Makah is stress accent, which is probably the case in Nuu-
chahnulth as well.
11
   Wilson (1986) formulates a similar rule in metrical terms. See also Stonham (1994a, b).
12
   Jacobsen (1969b: 13-14) also discusses Sapir & Swadesh’s (1939) treatment of labialization.
13
    Vowel-glide contraction also operates synchronically in some cases. See, for example, discus-
sion of (65)b in §3.3.1.
14
    However, caution is required here because Makah vowel-glide sequences do not always corre-
spond to persistently long vowels in Nuuchahnulth. For example, corresponding to the Makah
suffix ,Cdx`K ‘... many days’ we find Nuuchahnulth ,CHK, which contains a long vowel that neu-
tralizes as normal.
15
    ,hmj is derived from the underlying form ,(C)hmji by other processes. See below and §3.3.8.
Incidentally, a more accurate, but also more cumbersome, gloss for l`ji, is ‘conduct a commer-
cial exchange, esp. buy’.
16
    There are apparent exceptions in this environment, e.g. l`jFTjs ‘purchased goods’ (< l`ji,
+ ,-FTjs ‘obtained by ...’).
17
   For exceptions see §5.5.4.
18
    There are several other templates in addition to those listed in here that appear in aspectual for-
mations (e.g. [RepR], [IterL]). These are described in Chapter 6.
19
     The [LR] abbreviation is introduced in Jacobsen (1997a) as a substitute for Sapir and
Swadesh’s original symbol [RG].
20
   See examples (66) and (69) below.
21
    This process, traditionally referred to as “hardening” by Wakashanists, occurs in both branches
of Wakashan, and is one of the best known aspects of the phonology. Confining ourselves first to
sources that deal only or primarily with Nuuchahnulth, we can cite (among others) Sapir (1911a:
16; 1924: 82, note 1, 90, note 62; 1938), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238), Swadesh (1933: 6), Rose
(1976, 1981: 18-19), Nakayama (1997a: 16-19). On hardening (glottalization) in Ditidaht, see
Swadesh & Swadesh (1933: 200), and, for Makah, see Jacobsen (1996) and §3.4.2.

22
   Cf. also Sapir’s (1938, reprint 1949: 231-32) discussion of the historical origins of glottaliza-
tion, where he argues that it is unlikely to have been simply a result of coalescence of consonant
+ glottal stop clusters.
23
   Like glottalization (§3.3.2), lenition (referred to as “softening” by Wakashanists) is a well de-
scribed process, and the two are often treated together. Many of same sources are relevant: Sapir
(1924: 92, note 84; 1938), Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 238), Swadesh (1933: 5-6), Rose (1976,
1981: 18), Nakayama (1997a: 19-20). On lenition in Ditidaht, see Swadesh & Swadesh (1933:
199), and, for Makah, see Jacobsen (1996) and §3.4.2.
24

the corpus. QtKF`r is found at NA 15.18.

   Final /a/ is present underlyingly, but does not appear in the surface form due to a rule of final
vowel deletion in Makah (§3.4.3) (cf. also Jacobsen 1971).

32
   This, incidentally, raises the question of the historical source of modern Southern Wakashan
non-labialized velars, which, with the exception of /w/, are by no means rare in the present day
languages. That is, if PW velars became alveo-palatals, whence the velar in morphemes like the
N, M root j`, ‘stick-like object protruding’?

   TRANS = transitivizing suffix used with stative or intransitive verbs (Boas 1947: 241, #6); NOM
= nominal suffix (Boas 1947: 323). Thanks to Emmon Bach for checking my Kwakwala forms.
He drew my attention to the fact that Boas (1947: 353) erroneously writes the ‘lick’ root in (120)c
with a plain voiceless velar stop. I have substituted the correct glottalized form per Lincoln and
Rath (1980: 244).
34
   See Haas (1969: 111-112, 115-120) for discussion and examples of similar correspondences
between Nuuchahnulth and Ditidaht.
35
   This word, like many others with original */Wi/, now contains morphophonemic /Gi/ (§3.3.2).
36
   Makah voiceless stops undergo the allophonic process of coda aspiration described for Nuu-
chahnulth in §2.1.
37
   This example and the next are found on page 16 of a revised version of Jacobsen (1996) in
Jacobsen’s possession.
38
   Jacobsen (1996) indicates these segments with a capital barred-l.
39
   Jacobsen (p.c.) has recorded this suffix as ,#` and ,#h. The ,#t form appears in my data.
40
   This example is found on page 9 of a revised version of Jacobsen (1996) in Jacobsen’s posses-
sion.
41
   See §2.5 for accent.
42
   Some speakers change /@/ preceding /v/ to /N/ so they would have [c`9Kn9w].
43
   Interestingly, Ditidaht shows similar patterns of syncope except that, in Ditidaht, it is the sec-
ond of the two vowels that deletes rather than the first. See Swadesh & Swadesh (1933).
44
   This first-syllable shortening sometimes seems to apply also in words that have undergone ep-
enthesis (§3.4.3).
45
   More fully translated in Makah as ‘good, rich tasting, full of fat (said of shellfish)’.
46
   Actually, the question of whether Makah, Nuuchahnulth, and other languages with lexical ver-
balizing suffixes can be characterized as incorporating is controversial. I am agreeing with the
                                                352
view expressed by Sapir (1911b) and Mithun (1984), among others, that these languages are not
incorporating. See Jacobsen (1993: 266-67, note 2) for discussion.
47
   Swadesh himself (1933: 11, note 1) compares them to the Latin enclitic conjunction -que.
48
   At least one of these, x@K ‘yonder’, is attested in Makah as well.
49
   See §4.4.1 for brief comments on grammatical relations. The relevant aspect of this topic here
is that a subject category can be justified for Southern Wakashan.
50
   Cf. Swadesh (1933: 101-02).
51
   This characteristic of Nuuchahnulth and Southern Wakashan languages contrasts sharply with
the situation in Salish languages, which are generally quite careful about indicating transitivity.
52
   However, equational clauses involving personal names, place names, and RPs that contain the
article do require a copular element. See below for discussion.
53
   See Chapter 8, note 114 for discussion of classification of property words.
54
   Jacobsen (1979a: 114) tentatively reports a possible restriction in Makah against occurrence of
the future tense clitic with nouns. However, I was able to elicit several examples of nouns with
this clitic with no difficulty.
55
   A few exceptions to this generalization have turned up in Nuuchahnulth, but syntactic predi-
cates expressing names all seem to have existential readings, e.g. there at the door is Codfish-
always-getting it (the name of a family crest), rather than equational readings.
56
   See §8.2.3 for the forms of independent pronouns.
57
   Cf. Sapir (1924: 86, note 31)
58
   This claim does not apply to proper names, which, as discussed in §4.4.3.2, cannot function as
(syntactic) predicate heads.
59
   Swadesh (1939: 82) proposes the same analysis, labeling the Nuuchahnulth article a “subject
relative” in a list of modal formatives and glossing it ‘he who is, does’.
60
   However, the proper analysis of Makah RPs with possessive clitics, which have essentially the
same syntactic distribution as the article, (e.g. E`o`b<rhr ‘my canoe’) is as yet unclear.
61
   Some have suggested that referring expressions in Salish languages are also nominalized predi-
cates or clauses. See, for example, van Eijk (1997) on Lillooet and Thompson, Thompson, &
Egesdal (1996) on Thompson. Similar claims have been made for other languages of the Ameri-
cas. See Comrie & Thompson (1985: 391-95) for a brief review.
62
   Relative roots do have the special property of remaining the grammatical head of the word
when affixed by nuclear lexical suffixes, which otherwise become head themselves. See §5.1.
63
   These might be considered a kind of equational clause (§4.4.3.2).
64
   Often it is also possible to express manner of action and relation in a single derived verb, with
the manner expressed by the base and the relation by a suffix, e.g. M J`b,hx@, N J`b,H pinch-
give.PERF ‘pinch sth off and give it to’, M C`p,hx@, N C`p,`xH push-give.PERF ‘push sth to sb’,
M Bhbj,hx@ throw-give.PERF ‘throw sth to sb’, N b`r,Hbr chase-bringing.along ‘chase sth
along’. For an example of the first word, see (201)b.
65
   With some hesitation he terms this construction “serialization”, a characterization I find mis-
leading because of the many differences between the Southern Wakashan construction and con-
structions called “serial verb” constructions in other languages, e.g. 1) any number of predicates
can be so combined (although more than two or three is uncommon), 2) the set of predicates from
which bare absolute predicates can be drawn is open-ended, 3) any lexical item can fill the role of
main predicate or of the bare absolute.
66
   “Serialization combines multiple clauses into a unit that expresses a single state of affairs (=
event or state), i.e. a predication” (Nakayama 1997a: 115).
                                                 353
67
    See Anderson (1985: 9-10) and Spencer (1991: 37-39) for introductory discussion. In Sapir’s
(1921: 142-43) morphological typology, Nuuchahnulth (or Nootka, in his terminology) is classi-
fied as having a polysynthetic level of synthesis and “agglutinative (symbolic tinge)” technique.
68
   See Fortescue (1994) for more detailed characterization of polysynthetic languages.
69
   In a 100-word sample from Text 2 in Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 19-21), Jacobsen (1993: 266)
counts an average of 3.66 morphemes per word in Nuuchahnulth, which just slightly lower than
Greenberg’s (1954) figure of 3.72 morphemes per word in a similar sized sample from Eskimo.
70
   Figure 2 should be understood as a static representation of the structure of existing words,
rather than a generative device for creating new words. Without extensive filtering or constraint
mechanisms, Figure 2 will generate many impossible words.
71
   This statement does not apply to words formed on relative roots like N x`pi, M x`p@ ‘one
who, that which’, which always determine the category of the resultant word regardless of suffix
type, e.g. N x`pi plus the verbalizing suffix N ,FhC ‘clothed in ...’ forms the noun x`piFhC
‘clothing, what one is wearing’ rather than the verb *‘wearing sth that is ...’.
72
   The terms “core” and “peripheral” are borrowed from Nakayama (1997a), where they are used
in a different sense.
73
   See Haas (1972) for more on Nootkan root structure.
74
   As mentioned later (see note 114 in Chapter 8), it is not clear if evaluative and dimensional
terms are a subclass of verbs or constitute a separate class of adjectives.
75
   See Rose (1981: 284-89) for a different classification scheme.
76
   Eskimo languages also have suffixes of this type, which are sometimes called “post bases” in
the specialist literature (e.g. Jacobson 1984, Miyaoka 1996). Eskimo, Wakashan, and Quileute are
strikingly similar in their reliance on these suffixes to the virtual exclusion of other word-
formation techniques. Eskimo languages are even more extreme than Wakashan and Quileute in
this respect.
77
   Other works refer to nuclear suffixes as “governing” suffixes, a term I avoid since nuclear suf-
fixes sometimes do not “govern” the base in the sense used in current grammatical theory.
78
   This statement is generally true, but oversimplified. Certain restrictive path-orientation suffixes
have the effect of deriving verbs due to their inherent perfective aspect (§5.5.1). In these cases,
the restrictive suffix could be considered the grammatical head, but the base remains in some
sense the main semantic element.
79
   These types roughly correspond to Swadesh’s (1933, 1939) governing action and governing
state suffixes.
80
   Rose (1981: 357-58) categorizes most of my verbalizing state suffixes as “adjectival” rather
than “verbal” suffixes, but, assuming her (p. 344) definition of the adjective class, it is not clear
how this could be correct. Jacobsen (1979a: 139) refers to Makah ,h9b ‘belonging to ...’ as form-
ing adjectives, but since he considers Makah adjectives a subtype of intransitive verb, there is no
disagreement with the present analysis.
81
   Locale suffixes are called “zone” suffixes in Davidson (1999).
82
   The initial vowel is shortened due to insertion of the long epenthetic vowel (§3.4.3).
83
   “The use of suffixes for adding new material ideas to the initial morpheme is common to a re-
stricted area inhabited by all the Kwakiutl dialects, Nootka [and other Southern Wakashan lan-
guages––MD], Quileute, and Salish. Outside of this area it is unknown. Its closest analogue is
found in the suffixes of the Eskimo language” (Boas 1947: 236).
84
   This root element must go back to Proto-Wakashan, cf. Kwakwala forms such as vhP5mWi` ‘to
fail to go straight to a person’ (Boas 1947).
                                                 354
85
   My analysis of Southern Wakashan aspect draws on that of Swadesh (1931, 1933, 1939), Sapir
& Swadesh (1939), and Rose (1981), but, as will be seen, differs in certain respects from each of
these.
86
    Actually, to be more precise, aspect is indicated by the final morphological constituent of a
stem. This is often a single morpheme, as stated in the text, but may also be a combination of two
or more restrictive spatial suffixes, which together have a single aspectual value (§5.1), or an as-
pectually significant CV template applied to a base.
87
   “[A]ll verbs have durative and momentaneous, or inceptive, aspects, most have also at least one
iterative aspect, and many have still other aspects” (Sapir 1924: 82, note 1). “The aspect system
consists of a set of categories based on two primary aspects, durative and momentaneous.” (Sapir
& Swadesh 1939: 240).
88
    “We may class Nootka words into three semantic types, on the basis of their meaning in the
durative and momentaneous aspects” (Swadesh 1931: 24).
89
    These definitions were formulated for momentaneous and durative categories in Ditidaht, but
can be shown to reflect Swadesh’s thoughts on Nuuchahnulth as well, although these were never
so succinctly expressed.
90
   Some authors (including Klein) reserve the term “aspect” for viewpoint aspect.
91
   In fact, potential for occurring with the graduative imperfective is a good test for determining
whether a base is perfective.
92
   Rose (1981: 275) describes the graduative morpheme as [L] in Kyuquot dialect, but examples
like perfective M, N v`g@j ‘go’: graduative M, N v@g`j ‘going’ show that it must be [L+S] in
Tseshaht and Makah.
93
   The term “continuative” is from Rose (1981). Sapir & Swadesh (1939) simply call this aspect
the ‘durative’, not differentiating it terminologically from the ,`ji/,tj durative described in
§6.5.2.
94
   This kind of “what-if” elicitation technique was suggested to me by Ann Renker (p.c.).
95
   Formation of the repetitive in Makah is first described in Jacobsen (1971).
96
   Iterative formation is first described for Makah in Jacobsen (1971).
97
   Note in this regard that the formal resemblance between the Habitual enclitic <F`9K` (§7.4.2)
and iterative II morphology may not be coincidental.
98
   See also Swadesh (1933: 8-11), Rose (1981: 291-92), and Nakayama (1997a: 21-23).
99
    Jacobsen (1973) describes a “relative” formative ,W (e.g. in vhJHsW vdFhC ‘no one is sleep-
ing’). Since I judge this to be a specialized use of the peripheral suffix ,(W)W ‘while, meanwhile’
rather than a clitic, it is not discussed in this chapter.
100
     See also Rose (1981: 212-234) for Kyuquot dialect forms and Nakayama (1997: 30-41) for
Ahousaht.
101
    The Inferential I is, however, listed in Sapir (1924: 101, note 178).
102
     These formatives are not mentioned in Sapir & Swadesh (1939), but are listed in Swadesh
(1939: 82-83).
103
     Two other Makah morphemes given by Jacobsen (1986) as evidentials, ,P`ch and Jtj, are
here analyzed as specialized peripheral layer evidential uses of lexical suffixes rather than as cli-
tics. In this regard, it is significant that <oh9s follows the temporal specifier, which shows it must
be a clitic, but -P`ch and ,Jtj precede it. This does not guarantee peripheral suffix status, but is
consistent with it.
104
     Jacobsen (1973) refers to the first of these moods as the “informational interrogative” and the
second as the “confirmational interrogative”.
                                                355
105
    There are a few examples of it attaching to a lone demonstrative in Nuuchahnulth, however,
e.g. F`GjTFh ‘that one’.
106
    Tseshaht x@ is probably cognate with the morpheme g@ in Kyuquot dialect that Rose (1981:
40) describes as a definite article.
107
    In Makah, the article itself may be extended by demonstrative elements: <?hp`9c proximate
article, e.g. PhcHkhp@c ‘this dog’, <?hp@b distal article, e.g. PhcHkhp`9b ‘that dog’.
108
    See Rose (1981: 206, ex. 43; 209, ex. 60-61)
109
     Rose (1981), Rose & Carlson (1984), Whistler (1985), Emanatian (1986), and Nakayama
(1997b) may be consulted for further discussion of passivization in Nuuchahnulth, especially the
controversy over whether this construction should be properly be considered a passive or an in-
verse. The reader will correctly infer from my labeling the morpheme in question “passive-
inverse” that I consider the question to be terminological. The Southern Wakashan construction
simply mixes properties associated with constructions called “passive” and “inverse” in other
languages. It appears to be intransitive like the English passive, but is subject to person and topi-
cality hierarchies like inverse constructions in Algonquian languages.
110
    An obvious alternative analysis of this construction some have suggested describes ,(C)hK as an
object case marker. Rose (1981: 62-67) presents several arguments against such an analysis and
for a multi-clausal analysis like the one given here.
111
    This is perhaps a typo for ,@bxhm, the normal shape of this suffix, cf. Sapir & Swadesh (1939:
319).
112
    Makah has a morpheme ,""tW seems analogous to the Nuuchahnulth irrealis clitic, but it is not
yet fully analyzed.
113
    In formal speeches first person singular forms may have plural reference (i.e. ‘I’ = ‘we’).
114
    The classification of many words expressing property concepts is unclear. This uncertainty
primarily involves free roots like dimension terms, e.g. M, N F`p ‘wide’, M FhFHWi`, N FHGi
‘big’, and evaluative terms, e.g. M QtKT, N QtK ‘good’, and also some words with the durative
aspect suffix, e.g. M, N Ihrtj ‘white’, M, N F`C`ji ‘propped, wedged up’. Most property words
probably belong to a subclass of verbs, as proposed by Jacobsen (1979a), but some may consti-
tute a separate class of adjectives (Rose 1981). Their syntax requires further investigation before
definitive classification can be made. Other property words such as those formed with suffixes I
have classified as verbalizing state suffixes (§5.4.1), e.g. M ,chs, N ,mhs ‘stocked with ...’, M, N
-h9b ‘belonging to ...’, are more clearly verbs.
115
    Jacobsen (1979a: 84-108) includes a thorough review of various proposals concerning South-
ern Wakashan word classes in both the primary and secondary literature.
116
    This is a different sense of “nominal” from the one used in the preceding list of word classes,
where the word simply means ‘having the character of a noun, noun-like’.
117
    I therefore disagree with Nakayama’s (1997a: 64) contention that “...[T]here is no strong for-
mal basis for positing word classes in Nuu-chah-nulth. That is, there is no unique and constant
correspondence between sets of words and formal markers or formal structuring patterns that jus-
tifies grammatical classes among words.”
118
    Note also that this is a rare example of a post-head predicate modifier hosting a clitic.
119
    The speaker is the mythological culture hero Kwatyaat, whose speech is characterized by in-
serted /x/’s (Sapir 1915, reprint 1949: 186; Sapir & Swadesh 1939: 210, footnote 8).
120
    Jacobsen (1979a: 106) makes the same claim: “[T]he momentaneous [i.e. perfective––MD]
formation ... derives verbs from stems of other classes.”
                                                356Appendix A: Lexical SuffixesLists of Nuuchahnulth and Makah lexical suffixes are presented below. Citation of Nuuchahnulthsuffixes is based on the more-or-less complete list provided by Sapir & Swadesh (1939: 316-34).","[365, 366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371, 372]"
"    I mentioned earlier (§2.3) that syllables containing coda nasals pattern with syllables contain-ing long vowels with regard to a certain phonological alternation involving length. The availableevidence is contradictory as to whether this parallelism continues with accent placement. Ston-ham (1994a: 126, 1994b: 16) cites data from Sapir’s unpublished field notes on Nuuchahnulththat suggests it does: ChlrLHs ‘Son of Bear’, G`Chlrhpr`jFh ‘her brothers’, ghRhlXTo ‘gathertogether’. However, Sapir (1924) contains several words in which a coda nasal in the second syl-lable does not attract stress from a short first syllable as we would expect given the examples in(18)b: QhRQhm ‘foot’ (ln. 19), GhrhlX`vhF`Q ‘now became blood-covered’ (ln. 20), ghKxhmFh ‘theone at the bow’ (ln. 50). Further research is required to address theses discrepancies.

3 Phonological AlternationsA variety of phonological alternations take place during word formation, the most important andcommon of which are described in this chapter. The presentation is descriptive in intent and in-formal for the most part, although, for descriptive purposes, it does assume a model of phonologywith extrinsically ordered rules applied to underlying forms.","[42, 43]"
"    An important and commonly used subclass of nominalizing suffixes are the enumerative suf-fixes, which attach only to quantity/quantifier bases like N F`x`, M F`jxHp ‘many’ and numer-als. These are similar to numeral classifiers in languages like Chinese in that they index certainphysical or configurational properties of quantified entities, e.g. N F`QphlK, M F`Qp`oK ‘tworoundish or chunky objects’, N F`QOHK, M F`Q@O@xhK ‘two long, broad objects’, N F`QBhp, MF`Q@Bhp ‘two long, thin objects’. Although they can be used independently as nouns, classifiedquantifier words are generally used to modify a noun denoting an entity of the appropriate type,e.g. N F`QOHK mhsto ‘two beams’. Not all enumerative suffixes are nominalizing suffixes. Forexample, the suffixes N ,pFhCG, M ,PhCW ‘for ... many years’ and N -CHK, M ,Cdx`K ‘for ... manydays’ are nuclear temporal suffixes (for which see §5.4.4).",[210]
"For example, the Nuuchahulth verb F`QphlKHbr`S`r ‘carry two round objects out of the woods’in (267) consists of the numeral root F`Q, ‘two’ plus the nuclear nominalizing suffix ,phlK ‘...many round objects’, forming the noun F`QphlK ‘two round objects’. This in turn serves as basefor the nuclear verbalizing suffix ,h9br ‘bringing, carrying ...’, forming the verb F`QphlKHbr‘carrying two round objects’. The word is then capped off by the restrictive sequence ,`s,""`r‘move out of the woods on the ground’, which, incidentally, is another example of a path suffixdetermining aspect despite a following locative suffix.

5.2 Roots
5.2.1     Bound rootsRoots make up about three-fourths of the underived lexicon, the rest consisting of suffixes and afew particles. Roughly half are bound roots, that is, roots that cannot function as words without a(core) lexical or aspect suffix. Bound roots are written with a hyphen when cited: M p`W,, Np`G, ‘dead’, M, N E`, ‘water’, M W`,, N G`, ‘complete, sufficient’, M Q@v`p,, N Ghr, ‘blood,bleed’, M, N Shpi, ‘sit’. Most correspond semantically to English verbs and adjectives, and mostare monosyllabic, although there are disyllabic roots (e.g. M IHc`p, ‘foggy’, N F`L`p, ‘havesexual intercourse with’), and even a few trisyllabic members of the category (e.g. M F`xhr`p,, NF`xhr`W, ‘trick, deceive’).73 The suffixes that a bound root occurs with to form derived words aredependent on the combinatory possibilities of that root and the communicative need of the mo-ment.

8.2.3   Independent pronounsSouthern Wakashan has a set of independent first and second persons pronouns. Nuuchahnulthpronouns have distinct forms for referential, predicative, and possessive functions (Table 25). The

4.4.2   The grammar and functional dynamics of subject choiceAn important characteristic of the syntax (really, an interaction between syntax and discourseprinciples) is a strong tendency for speech-act participants (i.e. first and second persons) andhighly topical third person arguments to occupy main grammatical roles, particularly subject.49 Itis not, of course, uncommon for languages to show a statistical preference for coding such par-ticipants as subjects, but Southern Wakashan stands out for how sensitive the structure of basicclauses is to reference-related requirements on subject choice. The use of two common construc-tions, the passive-inverse and possessor-raising constructions, is largely controlled by these con-cerns. Details are reserved for §7.3.4 and §7.3.5, but a preliminary Makah example will give anidea of the considerations involved.
                                                117    When one argument of a transitive clause is a speech-act participant (SAP) and the other isthird person, the SAP must be the subject regardless of its semantic role. If the third person argu-ment is the P (patient-like argument), it is coded as object, and the clause is direct, i.e. non-passive-inverse.","[132, 133]"
"    I reserve word-class terms like noun and verb for words, but the Southern Wakashan lexiconalso contains many bound roots that cannot function as a word without affixation by a lexical suf-fix or aspectual formative. Bound roots are provisionally referred to as “bound verb roots” or“bound noun roots” (though the vast majority seem to be verb roots) based on morphosemanticparallelisms with free roots of the relevant class (§8.1).",[108]
"Literally, the construction means something like ‘X caused to be awake, doing it to Y’. See§4.6.1.1 for details on this type of construction.110    We turn now to the use of the passive-inverse in relation to the topicality hierarchy. Whenboth arguments of a transitive predicate are third person, the more topical of the two is generallycoded as subject, regardless of its role. If the A is more topical, the clause is direct: the A is codedas subject and the P is coded as object. If, on the other hand, the P is more topical, the clause ispassive-inverse: the P is coded as subject, and the A, if mentioned at all, appears as an obliqueagent RP. In syntactic terms, the passive-inverse clitic on the predicate head signals that the Prather than the A is subject. In discourse terms, it signals that the A is less topical than the P.
                                                 312    A definitive statement of the factors determining topicality in Southern Wakashan requires aquantitative text study, but recency of mention is a relatively clear-cut parameter that will serve todemonstrate the basic principles at work. In general, the more recently a referent has been men-tioned in the discourse, the more topical it is. If the A has been mentioned more recently than theP, and is hence more topical, it will likely be coded as subject, and the clause will be direct. Con-versely, if the P has more recently been mentioned, it will be subject, and the clause will be pas-sive-inverse. For instance, faced with the Makah sentences in (467)a-b out of context, an ad-dressee could interpret either sentence as ‘Bill saw Mary’ or ‘Mary saw Bill’.","[327, 328]"

The first person possessor in (168)is hence the subject and the second person participant, the S of cTvhprt ‘(be) father’, is oblique.","[116, 117]"
"    This example demonstrates the preference for having SAPs rather than third persons as sub-ject. A similar (though not so rigidly enforced) preference exists for more topical third personreferents to occupy the subject role rather than less topical third person referents. As others havenoted (e.g. Jacobsen 1993: 236), this plays a major role in reference tracking in the absence ofother structural means (like case marking, a gender system, etc.) that could serve this function.

4.4.3     Clause types
4.4.3.1    Verbal predicatesIn many languages, it is possible to classify verbal predicates by the number and types of objectsthey take: intransitive (no object), transitive (one object), and ditransitive (two objects). Some-times atransitive or ambient predicates, that is, predicates with no (semantic) arguments, are alsodistinguished. In Southern Wakashan, a classification with roughly these types is possible in the-ory, but in practice it proves difficult to assign every predicate to one or another of the types withcertainty. In this section I first present a few more-or-less straightforward examples of each of theapparent verbal predicate types (intransitive, transitive, ditransitive, and atransitive), and then dis-cuss problems that Makah and Nuuchahnulth raise for such a classification.","[133, 134]"
"    In both languages the possessive clitic participates in the very common possessor raising con-struction. In Makah, this is its primary use. It denotes that the subject (as indicated by the pro-nominal clitic in the clitic sequence) is the possessor of the S/A argument of the predicate head.",[324]

"    Predicate modifiers are distinguished from verbs by their lack of ability to function as predi-cate heads and by the pattern of clitic placement in predicates containing them (§8.4).
                                                326    The classification laid out in (491) does not include bound roots, since syntactic tests of thesort used to classify words are irrelevant to them. Some, like M, N Shpi, ‘sitting’ or M, N gto,‘roundish object’, seem clearly verbal or nominal, but, in the absence of specific distributionalcriteria, attempts at classification are speculative. Additional morphological criteria must be de-veloped to allow definitive placement of bound roots in the classification scheme. One way ofdoing this is to compare the morphological distribution of bound roots with that of free rootswhose categorical status is already established. For instance, it is known that when (free) nouns inconstruction with restrictive locative suffixes function as predicate heads, along with the regularreadings allowed nominal predicates, a bahuvrihi reading is generally possible whereby the sub-ject of the predication is asserted to have some association with the referent of the noun looselyreferred to as “possession” (§4.4.3.2), e.g. the noun root M PhcHQ ‘dog’ (in its combining formPhQC,) with the locative suffix ,""`Wr ‘in a vessel’ can have the meaning ‘X has a dog in a vessel’as a predicate head:(493) Noun as base

"    As for the third claim, Boas fails to show that the distinction is an artifact of translation be-cause the revised translation of ‘see a canoe’ he proposes to demonstrate this is nothing more thana convoluted restatement of the original translation. His revision still contains a verb phrase,namely ‘to perform an action relating to ... by seeing’. Hence, the suffix with this translationwould still produce a verb rather than a noun, which is precisely what is predicted. Further, thefact that ‘see’ is restrictive in the new translation is irrelevant since it does not modify the rightword. If the suffix were restrictive in the present sense, it would modify the base ‘canoe’ and pro-duce a noun denoting something about a canoe that sees or is seen. Instead, the phrase ‘by seeing’is an adverbial phrase that modifies the participle construction ‘relating to ...’, which itself modi-fies the word ‘action’ in the verb phrase ‘perform an action’. As Swadesh (1948b: 62) himselfpoints out:
                                                    185            Boas says that ‘to see a canoe’ ... may as well be conceived as ‘to perform an ac-
            tion relating to a canoe by seeing.’ But, since the stem alone means ‘canoe,’ this
            translation includes for the meaning of the suffix ‘by seeing to perform an action
            relating to’ –– which leaves the problem exactly as before ... It is no mere trick of
            English translation but an inescapable fact that the relation of subject and stem
            remains the same in [(279)a and (279)c] but is radically changed in [(279)b].","[200, 201]"
"    A core RP can be positioned before the predicate head under certain pragmatic circum-stances. Fronting of RPs has no effect on placement of clitics –– they remain on heads or predi-cate-initial modifiers as described in §4.3.4. Example (183) shows a pre-head subject:

         ‘A Tseshaht warrior likewise took hold of the (Maktliath) cedar line.’ (NT 182.15)The subject RP ‘a Tseshaht warrior’ has been displaced from its typical post-predicate positionand moved forward between the predicate-initial modifier and predicate head. The context for thisexample involves contrastive focus on the subject, which perhaps motivates the shift. A canoeload of Maktliath band warriors is struggling over a drift whale against a canoe load of Tseshahtwarriors. Both canoes have attached cedar ropes to the whale and are pulling in opposite direc-tions. The sentences immediately preceding this example read ‘The Maktliath warrior Sound-of-Dropping took the line (of the Tseshaht). He cut it apart.’ The subjects and objects in these sen-tences are in their usual position after the predicate . The tit-for-tat action reported by example(183) produces a contrastive focus reading: ‘A Tseshaht warrior likewise took hold of the (Mak-tliath) line.’    Unlike core RPs, RPs functioning as oblique adverbial modifiers do not bear a grammaticalrelation to the predicate head. As described further in §4.4.3.1, it can be difficult to determine insome cases whether an RP is an object or an oblique, but differences in behavior do exist that dis-tinguish the two (e.g. ability to passivize). Obliques most commonly occur after core RPs (184)g.","[127, 128]"
"Let us first consider the principles governing the use of the passive-inverse in relation to the per-son hierarchy.109    When one argument of a transitive clause is a speech-act participant (SAP) and the other isthird person, the SAP must be the subject regardless of its semantic role.

"Class-inclusion predicatesIn Makah and Nuuchahnulth, nominals may function directly as predicate heads with no interven-ing copular element.52 They take predicate clitics exactly as verbal predicates do: there are no re-strictions on the predicate clitics they may occur with. The words in (205)-(206) show Makahnouns and property words as heads of class-inclusion predicates; that is, predicates denoting aclass of entities the subject is asserted to be a member of.53 Example (207) shows an intransitiveverbal predicate for comparison. The coding of each clause type is identical: the mood and pro-nominal clitics are attached directly to the predicate head in all cases.

"    An unextended word is formed by a base plus zero, one, or more “lexical” suffixes (deriva-tional suffixes with relatively concrete meanings) and zero, one, or more aspectual morphemes.

            ‘Kithltsim clubbed him (once) with a stick of wood’ (NA 447.33)With stative bases (e.g. nouns, property words, stative verbs) the perfective suffix usually ex-presses perfective change of state (an inceptive/inchoative/ingressive reading). Comrie (1976: 19-20) mentions several other languages that allow this type of reading with perfective markers onstative verbs. In these languages, among them Ancient Greek, Spanish, and Russian, this possibil-ity is apparently limited to a handful of verbs. In Southern Wakashan, on the other hand, it is therule –– almost all stative bases produce a change-of-state readings with the perfective suffix.

Or, phrased in aless English-centric fashion, we might say what is expressed as motion (with ‘go’ or ‘come’) inEnglish is often not expressed as motion in Southern Wakashan, but as simple change of location(‘get to be at X’). This can also be seen with the nuclear verbalizing suffix M, N ,Ch ‘at ...’, whichmeans ‘get to be at ...’ (usually glossed as ‘go to ...’) when it is followed by the perfective suffix.","[240, 241]"

                                                 122lations, or distinct primary object (PO) and secondary object (SO) relations. In a PO/SO system,the R argument of a ditransitive predicate is treated grammatically like the single P argument of atransitive predicate (Dryer 1986, to appear). The sentences shown in (198)-(199) might suggest aPO/SO system in Southern Wakashan, but this is probably artifactual. We have seen that, whileobjects are marked by clitics in Makah, they are not in Nuuchahnulth. There is one exception tothis rule: as shown in (198)b, first person objects in Nuuchahnulth are marked in clauses in Im-perative mood with second person subjects (§7.2.20).","[137, 138]"
"    The unextended word carries the lexical (dictionary) meaning of the word, while the cliticsspecify values for grammatical categories associated with the word in its syntactic context. AsSwadesh (1933: 11) puts it for Nuuchahnulth: “From the lexical point of view, the word is theunextended unit composed of stem plus derivational and aspect suffixes. From the syntactic pointof view, the word is the total phonetic unity, sometimes identical with the lexical unit, sometimesmore or less extended by [enclitic] elements.” In (153), for example, Makah vdFhE`k ‘he/she/it is
                                                 95sleeping’ is formed from the verb vdFhC ‘sleep’ plus the temporal specifier clitic <""`Q glossed“TEMP” (explained in §4.3.2 below) and<?h, the third person singular Indicative mood clitic.","[110, 111]"
