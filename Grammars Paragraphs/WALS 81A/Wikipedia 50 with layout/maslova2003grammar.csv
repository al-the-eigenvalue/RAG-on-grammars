Notes1.   The monographic description (Krejnovich 1958) is concerned mainly
     with the grammar of Tundra Yukaghir, with references to the Kolyma
     Yukaghir   materials   collected   by Jochelson;   (Krejnovich     1979)   also
     sketches the Tundra Yukaghir grammar.
2.   Note that if my description of a phenomenon         attested     by Jochelson
     and/or Krejnovich differs from that suggested by these scholars in more
     than the degree of detail, I usually indicate the deviation from the pri-
     mary description simply by “cf.” in front of the relevant reference, with-
     out going into the discussion of the controversy, in order not to over-
     load the book with details which are hardly interesting for its potential
     readers. However, if the differences appear to be significant, they are
     described explicitly.
3.   The examples from published texts are indicated by a letter (“F” for
     (Nikolaeva 1989), “K” for (Maslova 2001), and “T” for the texts in-
     cluded in this book) followed by the number of the text (according
     to the sources’ numbering). The transcription of Nikolaeva’s examples
     (which are presented in Cyrillic-based orthography) is mine. Note that
     a number of examples from (Nikolaeva 1989) contain some deviations
     from the published source, which reflects the results of discussing these
     sentences with informants; a reference to the published source has been
     preserved if such deviations are relatively insignificant (including car-
     rections of misprints). The examples from unpublished texts appear
     without any indication of the source, the examples elicited in interviews
     are indicated by the letter “I”.
4.   The materials published by Irina Nikolaeva in 1997 have not been in-
     cluded in the corpus of examples employed for this grammar precisely
     because I have had no chance to check them with other informants.
5.   For the same reason, I employ the examples cited by E. A. Krejnovich
     only in exceptional cases, simply because he normally does not indi-
     cate whether a particular example has been elicited in an interview or
     has been attested in a text. Furthermore, he mentions that he “con-
584    Notes      structed” some of his Kolyma Yukaghir examples on the basis of other
      data (1982:249); this method of cxemplification is never employed in
      this grammar.
      These percentages are based on data collected in 1987 by a joint expedi-
      tion of the Institute of Linguistics and the Institute of Ethnography of
      the USSR Academy of Sciences (St.Petersburg branches) and published
      by Nikolay Vakhtin (1992:50, Table 1).
      See (Vakhtin 1992:57-58) for a detailed description of how these ratings
      were obtained.
      In their reviews to an earlier version of this grammar,       Bernard    Com-
      rie and Christian Lehmann suggested that this system might. be more
      appropriately described as advanced tongue root (rather than palatal)
      harmony. Since a justifiable choice between these options could only
      be based on a thorough phonetic investigation of the phenomenon, I
      have opted for the term traditionally adopted in the Yukaghir studies
      (Collinder 1940:80-88; Krejnovich 1982:20-21; Nikolaeva and Helimsky
      1996:157).
      The voiced obstruent /Z/ does not occur in morpheme-final position.
      The final /n/ of the verb stem mon- ‘speak, say’ is dropped before the
      morph -d’e, e.g., mo-d’e ‘I said’, mo-d’ek “You (sc) said’, etc.
11.   The allomorph -j of the attributive marker -j# does not occur after
      consonants.
12.   The Resultative marker, the Stative marker, the copula 0-, and the final
      -o- in the qualitative and quantitative verbs are notably similar, so that,
      at least diachronically, they might be assumed to instantiate the same
      morpheme (see 6.3.6.1). Then, the phonologicaliy unmotivated alterna-
      tion /7/ ~ /d’/ is restricted to a smail set of morphological environ-
      ments. A further diachronic hypothesis might be that the morphemes
      constituting these environments used to contain a final sonorant, which
      triggered this alternation (see 3.3.1). This hypothesis is supported by
      Tundra Yukaghir data, where final /i/ of the Resultative marker and of
      qualitative stems like in (67) is still preserved in some contexts (Kre-
      jnovich 1982:98-99); sec also 6.3.6.
13.   That is why there is no special chapter on adverbs in this grammar.
14.   Krejnovich (1982:105) describes the forms of “degree of comparison"" for
      qualitative verbs. According to his observations, some nominal forms
      of the verb (referred to as Subject Nominal and Relative Nominal in
      the present grammar,       see 6.1.3.6-6.1.3.7) can signify a higher degree
      of quality, especially when     combined   with the nominal   Augmentative
      marker (see 5.6.1.2).
15.   See 5.5.5.2 on integration of Russian adjectives into Yukaghir grammar.
16.   Small    capitals denote   consonants   that can undergo   devoicing    after a
                                                                             Notes          8
                                                                                       oH
                                                                                            cn
       final voiceless obstruent of a stem, as described in 3.3.2.1.
 17.   In this sentence, the Plural marking on the verb is controlied by the
       Locative NP; for a description of such constructions, see 12.1.2.3.
18.    Krejnovich (1982:249) suggests that the A participant in Kolyma Yuk-
       aghir may get the Predicative marking as well; however,          his examples
       of this phenomenon contain detransitivized verbs (with the suffix -ze-,
       see §.4.4.2}, so that the Predicative marker is in fact attached to the §
       participant.
19.    For O marking in non-finite clauses, see 9.1.2.2.
20.    Krejnovich     (1982:253;   256)   observes a correlation between      the choice
       of -fe)k on the head and the presence of an attributive modifier; this
       correlation is in accordance with the functional account suggested here.
2i.    Krejnovich (1982:250-251; 256-257) considers presence vs. absence of a
       (lexical) noun modifier as the major factor which determines the choice
       of the Accusative vs. Instrumental marking.
22.    The combination ug+qo- ‘child+be-’ is apparently lexicalized with the
       meaning ‘be young’
23.    The verb inflection has been described by Jochelson (1905) and discussed
       by Krejnovich (1982:184-216). Krejnovich (1982:201-208), in contrast to
       (Jochelson 1905), claims that the transitive verb in Kolyma Yukaghir
       has the SF form in -i. This claim strongly contradicts my data, see
       (Maslova. 1997) for details and discussion. The absence of the transitive
       SF paradigm in Kolyma Yukaghir represents one of the major divergent
       features between the Yukaghir languages, as Tundra Yukaghir has a
       specialized transitive SF form with zero inflection (Krejnovich 1955;
       1982:209-210),
24.    Krejnovich (1982:149-151) includes the form in -m both in the Inter-
       rogative and in the Imperative paradigm; see /3.3.1.1 and 12.3.2 for
       Interrogative applications of this form.
25.    See 5.4.1.3, 12.2 for further examples and discussion.
26.    This is a clear point of divergence between Kolyma and Tundra Yuk-
       aghir.   In the latter, the affirmative pre-verb is employed        much       more
       frequently and can be analyzed as Predicate Focus marker                (Maslova
       1989; Comrie 1992; Fortescue 1996).
27.    The -ge- ~ -h- ~ -j- alternation in the third person Conditional DS con-
       verbs instantiates the same morphophonemic rule as the alternation of
       the Accusative marker after the Possessive marker (see 5.1.3}; in fact,
       the Accusative marker may          be assumed   to have   developed     from    the
       generic locative marker.
28.    According to Krejnovich (1982:167), the forms in -l-ge(ne) are used with
       the singular subject and the forms in -l-u-ke(ne) express the plurality
       of subject. This correlation is not confirmed by my data. The form in
586    Notes      -l-u-ge(ne) is absent from the paradigm presented by Krejnovich.
29.   Normally, the controlling clause is the next clause of a chain. See 1.1.1
      for further details.
30.   In fact, these suffixes might have been described as expressing Aktion-
      sarten. Krejnovich (1982:121ff) describes all the suffixes under discus-
      sion in this chapter as sposby protekaniya dejstuiya (i.e., Aktionsarten).
31.   It should be noted that the Result Nominal cannot. be analyzed as the
      Action Nominal form of the Resultative (although formally it might be
      possible), just. because the Resultative formation can be applied to a se-
      mantically restricted class of verbs (see 3.6.2), while the Result Nominal
      form is available for any verb.
32.   In Tundra Yukaghir two variants of the regular causative suffix, -s- and
      -se-, are distributed according to the general morphophonemic rule de-
      scribed in 3.3.4.1 (see Krejnovich 1982:68,; Maslova 1993:273).
      See 9.3.1.2.3 on the /d’/ ~ /n/ alternation.
      My informants seemed to be able to construct the form by attaching
      the nominal Instrumental marker to a pronominal stem, but not to use
      it, and it does not occur in texts.
      Here the Free Possessive form functions as a nominal modifier (see 8.2.1
      on this construction).
      Notably, this nominalizer was rendered as -bon by W.Jochelson      (1900),
      which makes it possible to posit the original form *bgn.
      This meaning is rendered by the noun kgnme ‘mate; the other’.
      In one example in [F9], the temporal demonstrative form tude appears
      to be used as a noun modifier (‘former’), see (571b). Since there are
      no other examples of this sort, this phenomenon is not discussed in the
      grammar.
      In this chapter,   the internal structure of complex NPs is indicated by
      angle brackets in the interlinear gloss.
      The Possessive Attributive marking (2.3.2) constitutes an exception to
      this rule.
      In this chapter, two separate referential entities invoked by an NP with
      nominal modifier are called ""Possessor” and *Possessed”, independently
      of the exact semantics of the relation between them.
      This is about the hero of a fairy-tale who has a bubble for a head, and
      that is why his name is Bubblehead.
      The thing is a straw and a worm at the same time.
      This rule does not cover the cases of pronominal Possessive marking, as
      described in 2.2.1.1.
      This meaning is not ruled out by cultural knowledge, since polygamy
      used to be allowed in the Yukaghir tribes.
      As described in 2.1.2, the construction is ambiguous between the posses-
                                                                        Notes   587      sive and the apposition interpretations, so the reading ‘the small goose’s
      daughter’ is also possible.
      This formulation does not take into account the possessive use of the
      zero marking, since in this case Attributive marking is not an option.
      This option was suggested to me by Bernard Comrie.
      Note that the Comitative markers in this example introduce the sec-
      ondary participant of a reciprocal situation (see 9.2.8}; two Comitative
      participants are conjoined by the connective adverb.
      See Note 127.
      In this chapter, the core participant. roles are shown by indexes A and O
      in the interlincar gloss unless they are recoverable from the case marking.
      See 5.4.1.6 on the semantic difference between the Accusative proper
      and the O-marking Instrumental
      This phenomenon was described by Krejnovich as “quasi-ergativity”
      (1982:232).
      I am grateful to Maria Polinsky for drawing my attention to this issue
      many   years ago.
      A special case not dealt with here is represented by relativization of the
      Possessor (see 1.3.1.4 for details).
56.   This meaning is impossible for Nominal clauses, simply because the head
      denotes a situation (not a countable referential entity).
57.   Note that this property is similar to topicality in Givén’s sense (i.e., topic
      continuity and persistence), with the qualification that the structuring
      of a text into episodes must be taken into account.
      The only exception may be the first and second person pronouns, which
      tend to trigger Accusative marking in all instances, sce (609a)}, (612a).
      In my corpus, there are no examples of Neutral (= Pronominal Ac-
      cusative) marking of these pronouns with third-person A. It should be
      noted, however, that my informants do rate the Neutral option gram-
      matical in such cases. Apart from this, the Accusative marking of the
      first and second person pronouns can be vicwed as an instantiation of
      the more general rule suggested here, insofar as they tend to refer to the
      most prominent entities in any episode they occur.
59.   An entity is taken to “occur” in some clause if it is involved in the
      situation being described, independently of whether: it is represented by
      an overt, NP within that clause.
60.   Note that the Accusative NP in such examples may represent the O
      constituent of the finite clause, cf. 10.1.3.1, 26.1.3.3.
61.   This property is shared by the Dative Experiencer as well (see 2.7.1).
62.   To be more precise, there is no convincing way to draw the distinc-
      tion between a sequence of independent clauses and a sentence built by
      juxtaposition of finite clauses.
588    Notes 63,   The term “clause conjunction” is used here to refer to any syntactic link
       between two or more clauses all of which have the same illocutionary
       function.
64,    In the latter function, it is opposed to specialized adverbial clauses, a
       relatively minor strategy for clausal modification of propositions (see
       11.4, 13.5.3.1).
       Some deviations from the strictly subject-oriented switch-reference pro-
       cedure are described in 14.1.3).
       “Perch” is interpreted as a proper name within the context of this fairy
       tale, hence the Nominative form in the Focus position.
       In this example, the detransitivized verb ley-de- ‘eat’ is used despite the
       presence of the direct object; this deviation is presumably entailed by
       the Desiderative suffix which is typically used with the detransitivized
       verb, but not with its transitive counterpart (leg- ‘eat’).
68.    The linear structure is posited for the DS clause and the controlling
       finite clause. The relation between the SS clause and the DS clause is
       more appropriately described in terms of nesting, see 2.4.2 for a further
       discussion of such examples.
69.    In this example, the underlined NP fills the Ablative slot of the verb
       londe- ‘separate (from)’, which is absent from the pattern of the verb
       paja- ‘carry’.
70.    Note that this application of the ordinary chaining is possible only under
       the specific mode of reference (1.2).
71.    This function appears to be fairly typical for sentence-initial temporal
       clauses across languages (Thompson and Longacre 1985:212).
72.    See 12.2.4 for a description of $s-chains with shared Focus.
73.    The     glosses for predictive conditional   constructions   are based on the
       context, as well on (Russian) translations provided by informants.
74.    In this example, the controller of switch reference is the Possessor of the
       finite-clause subject, see 14.1.3.2 for a description of this phenomenon.
75.    This example is one of very few exceptions from the rule of switch ref-
       erence: the DS form is used despite the shared subject.
76.    The term “complementation” refers to constructions where a clause de-
       noting a situation or fact fills a valence slot of the main verb (Noonan
       1985:42). Note that two of the three nominal verb forms employed
       for complementation, the Result Nominal (6.1.3.4) and the Prospective
       Nominal (6.1.3.5), can denote entities as well. In this case, they func-
       tion like ordinary NPs and can appear in a clause independently of the
       valence properties of the main verb. Such constructions are outside the
       scope of this section.
77.    However, see 2.2 for a group of verbs taking the Supine complements.
78.    This is the only type of phase verb existing in Yukaghir: other phase
                                                                           Notes      589      meanings are expressed morphologically {see 6.3).           See also 2.1 for an
      alternative complementation pattern for the verbs of termination.
79.   Thus, this construction might be described in terms of subject-to-
      subject raising.
80.   Note that the nominal complement of an intransitive verb of termina-
      tion fills the S slot of the matrix clause; in the pattern with converb, this
      slot is filled by the primary participant of the complement clause situ-
      ation. Thus, this construction might be described in terms of subject-
      to-subject raising.
81.   See 9.2.7.2.3 for the alternative pattern for the verb erd’- ‘want’.
82.   The Applicative may be thus taken as a morphological marking of the
      subject-to-object or object-to-object raising.
83.   There is a single interview example of relativization of the Dative con-
      stituent   (with the Passive Attributive     form,   see 6.1.3.3),   yet there is
      no text evidence confirming this possibility. It should be noted that the
      relativization of constituents other than core participants belongs to the
      class of phenomena, which do not lend themselves to reliable “interview”
      investigation, at least not in the case of Yukaghir; the only thing which
      can be said is that such constructions are not produced readily and are
      not attested in texts. No statements of absolute grammatical constraints
      can be made; yet even if such constructions are grammatically possible,
      they are far more “marginal” then Locative relativization and Possessor
      relativization.
84.   The only attested example is controversial, see comments to the sentence
      in (745).
85.   Note that in this example the Russian word svad’ba ‘wedding’ is used
      instead of the Yukaghir Action Nominal form n’e+mid’ul ‘taking each
      other’ with apparently similar meaning, which makes it possible to sug-
      gest that here this word refers not to the action itself, but to the place
      of festive activities.
&6.   Note that for same-subject situations, this meaning is expressed by
      means of the Perfective Converb, see 10.2.2.
87.   Otherwise, the causal relationship can be expressed by means of the
      Imperfective SS form; see 1.2.4.1.
88.   This property distinguishes a nominal predicate with the bound copula
      from the Stative form constructed with the same marker (see 5.5.5.2).
89.   Note that Predicative marking on the object is impossible in this con-
      struction, presumably because of the Predicative marking on the verb
      form.
90.   Krejnovich    (1982:208-209)   considers   this   construction   a part      of the
      Focus-marking system (for A Focus marking, which cannot be achieved
      by means of the regular grammatical Focus construction, see 12.2.1).
590     Notes       That approach is not accepted in this grammar because of significant
       differences in the role these constructions play in the grammar and dis-
       course. Most importantly, the construction with the Result Nominal
       is not obligatory in the environments which trigger compulsory Focus
       marking on the §/O participant (see 12.3.1); see also (Maslova 1997)
       for further details.
 91.   The “locative” pattern for predication of possession is presumably in-
       duced or at least strongly supported by Russian influence, where such
       a pattern constitutes the major option.
 92.   Note that a logically possible variant of dealing with such a situation
       would be to put the Focus O constituent in the clause-initial position,
       before the A constituent (which would have been then included into
       the scope of assertion). Yet this variant is prohibited by the word-order
       rules, i.e., this constituent order is not allowed in the Focus construction;
       see 9.1.5.1.
 93.   This ne can be assumed to be just the Russian negative marker.
 94.   Krejnovich (1982:151} gives the whole person /number paradigm of this
       verb, yet all forms but those of second person appear to be out of use.
 95.   In most instances these word order options cannot be distinguished (just
       because the subject is very often omitted).
 96.   For examples of questions to the $/O constituent, see 12.3.1.1.
 97.   Note that the phonological integrity of the complex gedo-l’e- is indicated
       by the alternation of the final /e/ with /a/ before the inferential marker,
       which shows that the stem as a whole belongs to the class of back stems,
       see 3.2.4.1).
 98.   The combination    el+juke can be fused into ejuke ‘not far’.
 99.   The interrogative pronoun kin ‘who’ does not take the negative prefix.
100.   This use of the manner question word is quite typical for colloquial
       Russian.
101.   Note that the possessive relationship between the subject of the main
       clause and that. of the subordinate clause is expressed by means of the
       bound (non-reflexive) Possessive marking (see (893)).
102.   Note that the verbs /’e- ‘be’ and a- ‘make’ can also combine with Inter-
       rogative adverbials to build questions to predicates (13.2.2.2).
103.   The omitted piece of the text represents the direct speech (what the
       brother was saying while he was crying).
104.   Thus, the grammatical Focus shows a predicate-like behavior; see 12.2
       on the syntactic status of the Focus.
105.   Thus, such a quantifier shows the same behavior as the grammatical
       Focus; see 8.3 on the semantics of this construction.
106.   Note that the comitative strategy of NP conjunction implies the single-
       event interpretation.
                                                                   Notes   591107.   This example involves an unexpected OF form in the first clause (the
       case marking and the word order indicate rather topicalization of the O
       constituent). Presumably, the narrator changed his plan: he was going
       to speak about karbasses, but then decided to mention that other people

"1.4.2. Direct object properties (O participant)
The direct object (O participant) can be distinguished from other
objects by the following properties:      e The O participant can receive the grammatical Focus (Pred-
        icative) marking, which is impossible for other objects.
      e The O participant can take the Nominative case form (under
        the conditions described in 1.1.1, 1.2.2).
      e The     O participant       can be promoted   to the S position by
        means of the Resultative (6.3.5.6.2).
      e The coreference of the O participant with the A participant
        is marked by the Reflexive marking on the verb (see 6.4.5.3,
        14.1.1.1).
      e The O participant can be relativized (see 11.3 for details).
      e The O participant can control scalar quantifier floating (see
        8.3).
                                Core participants   and grammatical relations   3411.4.3. Indirect object properties (Dative participant)
The following properties are shared by the O participant and the
Dative participant of a ditransitive clause (see 2.4.2), in contrast
to more marginal constituents:   e The O participant and the Dative participant of a ditransitive
         clause can take the Accusative case form (both the regular
         Accusative and the pronominal Accusative, see 2.4).
   e The reciprocal relation between the primary participant, on
     the one hand, and the O participant or the Dative partici-
     pant, on the other, can be marked by means of the Reciprocal
         marking on the verb alone (6.4.5.2), while for more marginal
         participants a free postposition-based reciprocal marker (see
         3.2.2) is needed.
   e The O participant and the Dative participant can control the
     omitted primary participant in the Supine Purpose clause
     (11.4.4).®
1.5.     Constituent   order
1.5.1.    Basic word order
The most frequent word order in terms of the core constituents is
subject-object-verb, which is illustrated by most of the examples
in this grammar. However, the word order, in particular in finite
clauses, is rather flexible and is more appropriately described by
the following “discourse-oriented” scheme:(619) Topic—Focus—verb-(After-Topic)
Since the Focus is grammaticalized, this scheme imposes two strict
constraints on the word order variation: the Focus cannot follow
the verb (see £4.2.2.3), and the A constituent cannot intervene
between the O Focus and the finite verb. As shown in 1.1.1, the
latter rule can play a major role in distinguishing the participants
of a clause.
342      Chapter   9. Syntax of the clause      There are two types of deviations from the SOV                           order:     right
dislocation (1.5.2) and clause-initial objects (1.5.3). NP disconti-
nuity is possible but rather infrequent (1.5.4).","[360, 361, 362]"
"5.2. Attributive marking
The non-Possessive Attributive form is available for arguments of
postpositions, but occurs extremely rarely. In fact, there are but
few examples of this usage (602). This is quite predictable, since
the arguments of postpositions are normally referential, which pre-
cludes Attributive marking (see 2.3).

               ‘He put the three closed boxes under the bed.’ [F43]
In contrast to this, the Possessive AttributivePossessive marking!in
postpositional phrases form is employed much more frequently for
arguments of postpositions than for noun modifiers.

               ‘Behind their house, there was a thicket.’ [F55]
If the argument of a postposition is an Action Nominal or a Re-
sult Nominal, this marking can be viewed as the most frequent,
“default” version.

Chapter 9
Syntax of the clause
This chapter discusses the case marking of the core participants
in finite (1.1) and non-finite (1.2) clauses. The most remark-
able feature of case marking in Yukaghir is the extensive employ-
ment of the well-known affinities between the core participant roles
and pragmatic (or information-packaging) properties of NPs (1.3).
Section 1.4 provides summaries of syntactic properties which may
serve to identify the grammatical relations of subject, direct object
and indirect object.
    The most frequent word order is verb-final, yet the relative
order of constituents is largely determined by their pragmatic roles
(1.5).
   Verb valence patterns are described in section 2.       Section   3
provides an overview of clausal adjuncts.","[341, 342, 343, 344, 345]"
"1.5.2. Right dislocation
The subject NP can be post-posed; in most cases, this order in-
volves highly predictable (recoverable) subjects, i.e., it occurs un-
der discourse conditions typical for so-called afterthought topical-
ization in other languages.

Other types of constituents are postposed less frequently, but this
is possible under the same discourse conditions:

1.5.3. Relative order of preverbal constituents
The      most    frequent           relative order    of preverbal       NPs    is subject-
initial, as illustrated by (622) and many other examples in this
grammar:
(622)      a. jathi-n                pugedan’d’e     ogil’l’a-yin     mon-t <...>

               ‘After he had learnt (it) by heart, the lake king called
               all fish elders.’ [T1]
However, a non-Focus object can precede the subject. Such exam-
ples may be accounted for in terms of topicalization of the object:

               ‘The human beings, nobody will eat them.’
The relative order of objects is rather flexible. In (624), the direct
object precedes the indirect object; the sentences in (625) show
the reverse order.

            ‘Then he gave his daughter to this boy.’ [F15]
Generally, the relative order of preverbal NPs can be assumed to
follow the scheme in (619), i.e., NPs which are within the scope of
assertion are closer to the verb; if there is a single NP within the
scope of assertion, it takes the preverbal position (independently
of whether or not it is marked for grammatical Focus).","[362, 363, 364, 365]"
"2.3.3. Relativization and complementation
Relative clauses are built by means of the Attributive verb forms,
the Action Nominal, and, far less frequently, by the Result Nomi-
nal. The syntactic roles accessible for relativization are the subject
(11a), the direct object (11b), the spatial or temporal adverbial
(11c), aud the Possessor of the intransitive subject (11d).

 8.1. Purpose
The history of Yukaghir studies features the names of two bril-
Hant researchers, Woldemar Jochelson and Eruhim Krejnovich,
who have provided the basic grammatical descriptions of the Yuk-
aghir languages (Jochelson 1898; 1900; 1905; Krejnovich 1955;
1958; 1968; 1979; 1982). The Kolyma Yukaghir language has been
briefly described by Jochelson (1905) and Krejnovich (1979); the
former source          (which is apparently              best known   to the English-
reading audience) is based on the rich data collected by Jochelson
at the end of the XIX“ century (1898; 1900}. Krejnovich’s es-
say in Encyclopedia of the languages of Asia and Africa (1979)
is based both on Jochelson’s materials and on Krejnovich’s own
                                                 About this grammer   13data collected in 1959. Finally, Krejnovich’s last work (1982) rep-
resents the most detailed and comprehensive source of information
on arange of significant issues for both Yukaghir languages. These
works constitute the major sources of first-hand data on Kolyma
Yukaghir,’ which have served as the basis for a number of papers
dealing with some specific topics, as well as for typological studies
involving Yukaghir data. A detailed description of Kolyma Yuk-
aghir phonology based on new field data constitutes a part of Irina
Nikolaeva’s unpublished Ph.D. thesis (1988b).
   Thus, there is no book which might serve as a reference gram-
mar of Kolyma Yukaghir. Further, some important aspects of the
language have not been described at all. This grammar is intended
to fill that gap, drawing both on the previous descriptions of Yuk-
aghir and on the results of my own field work, and thus to make
Kolyma Yukaghir data available for further studies, as well as for
cross-linguistic research.”
    The grarmmar attempts to cover all attested forms and con-
structions of contemporary Kolyma Yukaghir; in this restricted
sense, it is intended to be comprehensive. It is clear, however,
that no single book can provide a truly “comprehensive” descrip-
tion of any human language, at least not at the present stage of
development of linguistics. Writing a grammar inevitably involves
making a number of choices, so that some aspects of the language
structure may be described and exemplified in more detail, others
only briefly sketched, and possibly some may be omitted from the
description. Insofar as such decisions have been made consciously,
I have attempted to write this grammar in such a way as to “let
the language speak”, rather than to force it to answer any par-
ticular theoretically pre-determined questions. In other words, I
have tried to concentrate on those constructions and grammatical
distinctions that, appear to be of importance in Yukaghir gram-
mar and discourse, rather than on those that play a major role in
current linguistic theories.
14   Chapter   t. Introduction 3.2. The structure of the grammar
This grammar has a rather traditional structure:      it comprises a
sociolinguistic introduction (Chapter 2), Phonology (Chapter 3),
Morphology (Chapters 4-7), Syntax (Chapters 8-14), and Texts
(Appendix 3). The lexicon is represented by two Appendices: a
Yukaghir-English vocabulary (Appendix 1) and an exemplified list
of nonproductive verbal derivational suffixes (Appendix 2}. The
Morphology is divided into chapters according to the classification
into parts of speech, which is introduced in Chapter 4. The further
structuring of each chapter is essentially determined by two kinds
of considerations, which can be called paradigmatic and semantic:
    Whenever some morphological items clearly constitute a para-
digm, they are treated as such. Normally, I start a description of a
paradigm with a listing of opposed items and their form(s), which
is followed by a semantic (functional) description of cach particular
item. If it appcars that some morpheme can be more appropri-
ately described separately, not as a member of any paradigmatic
opposition (this is the case for some derivational morphemes), its
form and meaning are treated together. In both cases, I take the
form-to-function approach, that is, I describe the meaning(s) (or
function(s)) of grammatical items singled out on formal grounds.
These considerations determine the “micro-structure” of the mor-
phological description.
    On the other hand, the “macro-structure” of each chapter fol-
lows the function-to-form approach, that is, it features such gen-
eral semantic categories as, e.g., “Aspect” or “Demonstrative pro-
noun”, under which various paradigms or separate morphological
items are subsumed on functional grounds. In practice, this means
that considerations of semantic affinity prevail over distinctions in
the grammatical status, in particular, over the opposition between
inflection and derivation. For instance, the section on Aspect deals
with all morphological means employed for expressing aspectual
meanings, regardless of their regularity, productivity, and the like.
This is not to say, of course, that such properties are not expli-
cated for cach item. Normally, each section starts with a general
overview of the morphological means it describes, their (formal
                                                  About this grammar   = 15and semantic) relations to each other, grammatical status, etc.
   The Syntaz is structured according to similar considerations.
It is divided into seven chapters associated with more or less tra-
ditional topics in syntax, as determined by general classification
of syntactic units and types of syntactic relations. The internal
structure of each chapter is determined by grammatical distinc-
tions expressed   in Yukaghir,   that is, the constructions are classi-
fied according to functional considerations, which helps to high-
light the contrasting features of functionally similar constructions.
On the micro-level, the description of each construction takes the
form-to-function approach: my aim is to describe and exemplify
various constructions and the meaning(s) associated with these
constructions.
    I believe that this combination of the form-to-function approach
to the description proper and the function-to-form approach to
classification of items into chapters and sections of a grammar
appropriately suits the objectives of this endeavor: on the one
hand, it provides a reasonable degree of accessibility of informa-
tion on the basis of rather general and semantically motivated
headings determined by the more or less widely assumed view
on what a descriptive grammar should cover; on the other hand,
on the micro-level it licenses a description of grammatical items
and associated semantic configurations, as they are attested in the
specific language, rather than mapping of linguistic constructs and
concepts onto that language.
    To be sure, at a number of points these approaches turn out to
be in contradiction, i.e., the range of functions associated with a
morphological item or syntactic construction crosses the “bound-
aries” set. by the general semantic considerations. There is no one
way to solve the descriptive problems produced by such contra-
dictions that can be applied throughout the grammar. However,
there are two technical devices which are intended to override
these contradictions: cross-references between the relevant frag-
ments of fhe grammar and special sections providing summaries
of interrelated phenomena treated in different parts of the gram-
mar (c.g., there is a summary of properties which identify the
16   Chapter   1. Introductionsyntactic function of subject in Yukaghir; since these properties
manifest themselves in various types of syntactic constructions,
they are described in detail in different sections of the grammar).
To sum up, the macro-structure of the description offered here
is determined by how I understand what descriptive linguistics
is about; in many respects, it follows such general guidelines for
descriptive linguists as Lingua Descriptive Questionnaire (Comrie
and Smith 1977} and Language Typology and Syntactic Descrip-
tion (Shopen 1985). The micro-structure is determined by what I
know of Kolyma Yukaghir and represents an attempt to describe
the language “in its own terms”.","[31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]"
"2.2.6. Adverbs and postpositions
Spatial adverbs and postpositions have the locative paradigm com-
prising unmarked (Locative), Ablative (-t), Prolative (-n) and Di-
rectional (-yide) forms.
   Manner adverbs regularly contain the suffix -n; the same suffix
can be used to derive adverbs from qualitative verbs.
   Some postpositions can take the nominal Possessive marker
which cross-references the argument of the postposition.
                                   An   overview uf Kolyma   Yukaghtr grammar   92.3. Syntax
Word     order patterns     in Kolyma      Yukaghir      are overwhelmingly
head-final.     This order is obligatory in noun phrases               (attribute
-- noun, numeral - noun, possessor ~ possessee, etc.), postposi-
tional phrases (noun - adposition) and nou-finite clauses (SOV),
and it is preferred in main clauses. However, in the latter case,
other word orders are possible.
   NPs are easily dropped whenever recoverable from the discourse
context and/or speech situation.
   There is virtually no coordination, either between NPs or be-
tween clauses. The main strategy of NP conjunction is comitative
marking, and the main strategy of clause conjunction is clause
chaining.","[28, 29]"
"4.5.2. Functions of the Reciprocal4.5.2.1. Reciprocal constructions. The Reciprocal marks a recip-
rocal situation in which the reciprocal participants correspond to
the subject argument and some other argument of the verb. The
Reciprocal marker is productive and semantically very regular; it
can be attached to a verb whenever a reciprocal situation involv-
ing the relation expressed by that verb can be imagined. There
seem to be no purely grammatical restrictions on this operation,
228      Chapter    6.   Verb morphologye.g., in terms of transitivity, syntactic function assigned to the
secondary argument, etc. However, if the secondary participant
is represented by an NP other than direct or indirect object, an
additional free reciprocal marker is required (see 9.3.2.2).
    Although most instances of reciprocal marking involve the sub-
ject and the direct object arguments of a transitive verb, this seems
to be just a consequence of the fact that most two-argument verbs
are transitive (cf. 9.2.1).                The examples in (430) illustrate this
most frequent case:
 (430)     a. mit         n’e+totéos-il’t                  SeSpedanil’-ge

              ‘The two of them brought each other (if, for example,
               one of them was blind and the other lame).’
The examples              in (431)     illustrate the reciprocal marking         involv-
ing the recipient (indirect object) participant (431a), and the ad-
dressee (431b); in the latter case, the additional free reciprocal
marking is needed (see 9.3.2.2 for further examples of this type).

The reciprocal participants are normally represented by a single
NP in the subject position:

           other.’ [Ki]
See also 9.2.8 for another,       marginal,      option for encoding of the
reciprocal participants.
4.5.2.2. Natural reciprocals. The morphological reciprocal marker
can be attached to verbs signifying so called “naturally recipro-
cal” situations, without any significant change in the meaning, cf.
(430c) and (434a):
(433)   cejlu-        >    netéejlu-        ‘be far’
        kimd’t-        >   netkimd’-        ‘fight’

See also 3.3.2.3 for a natural reciprocal derived by means of an
Iterative suffix.
4.5.2.3. Incorporation. There are two attested cases of incorpo-
ration of a nominal stem between the reciprocal marker and verb
stem; the incorporated stem fills the patient/theme slot of the
verb.
 (435)      a. zooparke-ge           ob’ez’ana-pul   n’e-n’as’in        modo-t

               ‘Those Yukaghirs and those Evens used to understand
               each other’ s language; since they understood each
               other’s language, they helped each other. [K1]
Generally, incorporation-like phenomena are not characteristic of
Yukaghir, and the status of these cases within its grammar remains
unclear. It should be noted that neither a verb like *pgme+aysi-
‘lice-search’ nor one like *azu } medi- ‘language-understand’ exists
in Yukaghir independently; these combinations are possible only
in the context of the reciprocal. The form n’e-pgme-ans’i-jejl’i ‘we
are looking for each other’s lice’ is found in the texts collected by
                                                   Valence-changing   morphology   231Jochelson (1900:47), but this is the only example of this type in
his data. The grammaticality of this form was confirmed by my
consultants in 1987 (see (435)). The second example is taken from
a text written down by myself in 1992, but I have not managed                       to
elicit any other instances of this phenomenon during my field work.
It thus remains unclear whether there are strong lexical restrictions
on this phenomenon, or if it is a rare (perhaps marginal), but
free (with respect to the Icxical items involved) type of reciprocal
construction.
4.5.2.4. Lexicalization. Some combinations of the reciprocal
marker and verb stem are apparently lexicalized, e.g., n’e-mejnu-
‘to get married, to join’ (from mejnu- ‘to take something’),
ne-lej-nu-l-ben ‘predator’ (RECP-eat-IPFV-ATTR-RELNR), lit. ‘one
who eats cach other’.","[247, 248, 249, 250, 251]"

"3.   Accents   and   varieties
Given the small number of speakers nowadays, any notes about
dialectal or social varieties of Kolyma Yukaghir can only be spec-
ulative. However, the currently spoken idiolects are so distinct
as to prevent the best Yukaghir speakers from rating each other’s
language competence highly; Table 5 shows that not one got the
highest rating for language competence from any expert. These
distinctions, as well as the reluctance to acknowledge each other’s
competence, seem to result from two factors of language variation:
    First, the Yukaghirs currently living in Nelemnoye represent
two regional groups of Yukaghirs which used to exist before the
collectivization in 1931, One group roamed mainly along the Kor-
kodon River, the other along the Yasachnaya River. These groups
apparently spoke two distinct varieties of Kolyma Yukaghir. The
most notable phonological distinction concerned the labial vowel
harmony, which was characteristic of the Korkodon variety and is
24     Chapter 2. Kolyma   Yukaghir and its speakersstill maintained in the speech of some Kolyma Yukaghirs; one of
my consultants, A. E. Shadrina, a daughter of a Korkodon Yuk-
aghir, regularly labializes vowels in suffixes after /o/, which distin-
guishes her accent from that spoken by most of my consultants.
The same distinction was described by E. A. Krejnovich on the
basis of her father’s accent (Krejnovich 1982:21-22).
    Secondly, and most importantly, the Kolyma Yukaghir language
is undergoing an extremely fast modification, so that the varieties
of the language spoken even by neighboring generations are clearly
distinct. This seems to be a part of the survival strategy cho-
sen by the language in the aggressive sociolinguistic environment.
Each gencration faces a simple choice: given that their mother
tongue is not their first language, they can either reject speaking
that language and let it disappear, or simply speak as they can
(cf.   Vakhtin 1992:79-80).           So far, each successive age group has
chosen the second alternative. Quite predictably, the resulting
variety differs from that spoken by thcir parents in being more
significantly influenced by Russian.               Furthermore, it can be rated
as “corrupted” not only by the previous generation, but by the
speakers themselves. Yet, to some extent, this strategy of “survival
through modification” is approved by the oldest speakers, that is,
the speakers of the “purest” existing variety: they themselves do
use a special simplified Yukaghir-based jargon when addressing
younger people, just in order to be understood, yet to maintain
communication in their mother tongue.
    Now, it is clear that this strategy has been applied at least
since the end of the 19% century, which means that the current
group of “best speakers” used to represent a “corrupted” version
a couple of dozens years ago. Some of them are aware of the
differences between their own language and the language their
parents used to speak          (occasionally, my       questions were answered
like “I would say it this way, but my father would have said it
differently”). Even more so, they are aware of “mistakes” in the
language spoken by their fellow-citizens, hence low ratings of their
language competence.
                            The effect of language contact en Kolyma   Yukaghir   254, The effect of language contact on Kolyma Yukaghir
The most important contact languages have been Yakut and Rus-
sian. Now the contact with Russian is more significant. Russian
loanwords play an eminent role even in the Yukaghir everyday
vocabulary, e.g.:(13)   Yukaghir                                Russian
       terike       ‘wife, old woman’          starukha
       korobe       ‘cow’                      korova
       Sgstok       ‘staff?                    shestok
       uzzuo        ‘gun’                      ruzhjoNow Russian lexical items are being borrowed practically without
phonetic changes. Moreover, the borderline between the Yukaghir
lexicon and the Russian one is likely not to be “taken into account”
in the course of natural communication: almost nobody hesitates
to insert a Russian word into a Yukaghir utterance. In contrast
with this, the words borrowed earlier (like those given in (13)) used
to be changed according to the Yukaghir phonetic rules and gen-
erally preserve their Yukaghir phonetic form in the contemporary
speech,
   The instances of occasional code-mixing are numerous, cf. the
following examples (Russian grammatical and lexical items are in
boldface):
(14)   a. potomu éto        bogaty7-qo0:-t              gude-j
          [because          rich-TRNSF-SS:IPFV          become-INTR:38G
          tudel   tamun-n0-t               vzad-uperjod          ejre-ni
         he]      [this-cop-ss:IPFV        there.and.back       go-INTR:3PL]
         ‘Because he became a rich person, that is why they used
         to go there and back (swarm around him).’ [F38]
       b. davaj    tude-gele    andt-na            davajz   kebe-sil’i      da
         INGR      he-acc       ask-TR:3PL        [HORT go:1PL             CONJ
         kebe-s alt
         go:1PL]
         ‘They began to ask him (repeatedly), let us go, let us
         go.’ [F36]
26      Chapter 2. Kalyma   Yukaghir and its speakers          c. hodi         numg-gin
             go:IMP      house-DAT
             ‘Go home!’ [F36]
None of the Russian items involved in these utterances can be
viewed as integrated into Yukaghir grammar and/or lexicon; these
examples are intended just to represent a possible source of contact
changes.      Yet some grammatical items of Russian origin are used
very regularly and can be assumed to have replaced their original
Yukaghir counterparts. One of the most notable examples is the
Russian intensifier sam ‘self’ (in various phonetic forms):
 (15)     a. sam el-oZa-nu-j
             self  NEG-drink-IPFV-INTR:3SG
             ‘He himself didn’t drink.’ |K4]
          b. tude-gele      kudde-m            tude-sam   aj   amde-j
             [he-Acc    kill-TR:3SG] [he-self    CP die-INTR:3SG]
             ‘He killed that one and died himself, too.’ [K3]
Cf. the Yukaghir emphatic form of personal pronouns marked by
the suffix -id’ie, e.g., tude-l ‘he’ > tud-id’ie ‘he himself’.
     In the most general terms,               the effect of Russian contact on
Kolyma Yukaghir grammar can be described as a shift from origi-
nal Yukaghir synthetic grammatical patterns to newly introduced
analytical patterns. In some cases, the new pattern involves a
grammatical item borrowed from Russian. For example, obliga-
tive modality is now expressed almost exclusively by a construc-
tion with a Russian predicative loanword nado ‘is-necessary’ and a
nominalized form of a verb (as in (16a)), which is rapidly replacing
Yukaghir modal suffixes (the old pattern is illustrated by (16b)),
e.g.:
 (16)     a. tamun       min-gi         nado
             that      take-POSS necessary
             ‘It is necessary to take it.’
          b. tamun       min-moze
             that       take-PRSP{TR:1SG)
             ‘It, is necessary /inevitable to take it, I should take it.’
                                         Kolyma   and   Tundra   Yukaghir   27Another subclass of these contact phenomena comprises various
expansions of Russian-like grammatical patterns construed by
means of Yukaghir morphology, which squeeze out’ Yukaghir syn-
thetic patterns and take over their functions. For example, Yuk-
aghir has a verbal suffix -7- designating movement in order to
perform the action denoted by the stem. This suffix can occur
cither in a finite verb form as in (17a), or in a same-subject form
dominated by a verb of movement as in (17b}. Both patterns are
being rapidly replaced by a construction with the Supine, similar
to that found in many European languages (including Russian),
eg, (17c):
(17)   a. tabud-ek   — jug-jt-mele
         this-PRED look-PURP-OF:3SG
         ‘He went to look at this.’
       b. ans t-ga-t                keure-s”
          |search-PURP-SS:IPFV] go-PFV:INTR:3S8G
          ‘He went to look for it.’
       c. ans’i-din    kewe-s’
          search-SUP go-3SG:INTR
          ‘He went to look for it.’
Although the construction with the Supine is hardly new for
Kolyma Yukaghir, it can be assumed to have been a marginal
device for expressing this situation type until recently. Now, it is
the most common and frequently applied option, while the pat-
terns represented in (17a)-(17b), having no structural parallel in
Russian, are squeezed out.
   Similar phenomena are found in almost all fragments of Yuk-
aghir grammar and will therefore be described in detail in the
respective sections of the book. In general, I will try to present
modern Kolyma Yukaghir as it is used in everyday communication
(that is, by Yukaghirs over 55-60).","[43, 44, 45, 46, 47]"
"2.3.1. Case marking and grammatical Focus
Case marking patterns in main clauses are dominated by the Focus
system, Grammatical Focus is marked by means of the Predicative
case and an appropriate verb form (see Table 3). This marking
works on an ergative basis, that is, it can be applied to intransitive
subjects and direct objects, as shown in (7):
 (7)   a. tat   touke-lek    jedej-l
          CA    dog-PRED     appear-SF
          ‘Then a/the dog appeared.’ |K3]
       b. loéil-ek — ta-ta             piecet-nu-l’el-mele
          fire-PRED here-there         kindle-[PFV-INFR-OF:3SG
          ‘(She) made campfires here and there.’ [K3]
The major function of the grammatical Focus is to delimit the
scope of assertion from the preceding material (cither within or
outside the given clause), whereby the NP marked for Focus is
conceived as the left-most (i.e., the first in the linear order) con-
stituent within the scope of assertion.
   If a clause is marked for grammatical Focus, no other case mark-
ing of core participants is needed. Similarly, if the subject is first
or second person, and the direct object is third person, both occur
10      Chapter i. Introductionin the Nominative (unmarked) case (8a). Otherwise, the case-
marking pattern is nominative-accusative (8b)--(8c).
 (8)    a. met         tolow               kudede
           I{nom)      deer(Nom)            kill(‘rR:1sq)
           ‘] killed a deer.’ [I
        b. met           tet-ul      jug
            I(NOM) you-ACC see(TR:1SG)
            ‘I saw you (sq).’ []|
        c. tudel           met    konme-gele      jug-m
            he(NOM) my friend-ACC                   see-TR:3SG
            ‘He saw my friend.’ []]
If the direct object is represented by an indefinite NP, the Instru-
mental case form is used instead of the Accusative:
 (9)     — tudel       tolow-le             kudde-m
           he(NOM)     deer-INSTR.          kill-TR:38G
           ‘He killed a deer.’ {I]
Examples (8)-{9) show that Yukaghir lacks a uniform dircct ob-
ject encoding; the choice of marking depends on placement of the
Focus, person of the subject, and the referential properties of the
NP itself.","[29, 30]"
" 3.3. Data for this study and exemplification
This grammar is based on two types of data: authentic texts in
contemporary Kolyma Yukaghir and linguistic interviews with its
native speakers (see Acknowledgmenis). My text database com-
prises texts published by Irina Nikolaeva in 1989 and texts written
down by Nikolay Vakhtin (1987) and myself (1987, 1992);* some
of the latter are published in (Maslova 2001), and some are in-
cluded in this grammar {sce Appendix 3); in order to increase the
reliability of data, al] controversial and/or questionable sentences
of these texts have been double-checked with native speakers.?
    As discussed in Chapter 2, Kolyma Yukaghir has been under
strong pressure from Russian for at least several decades. This,
in combination with the well-known methodological drawbacks of
interviews, makes this sort of data far less reliable than those
elicited from authentic texts. That is why I tried to use only
text examples for illustrative purposes. As a result, some of these
examples might seem too long and complex for the point they are
intended to illustrate. Unfortunately, it is too often the case that
an authentic sentence “simplified” by a linguist for some didactic
purposes is not a reliable cxample anymore. In the case of such
languages as Yukaghir, the “unnecessary” complexity of examples
is the price to be paid for reliability of data. Even if I had a
simpler and, in some sense, “clearer” example in my field notes,
I always chose in favor of a text example.° In some cases, where
                                                About   this grammar       17this seemed to be inevitable, I did “shorten” illustrative sentences;
note that all such omissions are shown by <...>; such examples
should not be taken as “complete sentences”.
    There is, of course, a range of pheuomena which cannot be
appropriately described in this fashion because they are absent or
rare in the texts, but are readily produced by my informants in an
interview. ‘These phenomena are described in the grammar on the
basis of my field notes, but with explicit reservations concerning
the source of the data. If an example elicited in an interview
is included in the grammar (in order to avoid loss of significant
information), the source is indicated by the letter “I” after the
idiomatic translation.","[36, 37]"
" 3.8. Suffiz-initial /j/
The initial /j/ of some verbal suffixes alternates with /d’/, /é/
(cf. Krejnovich 1982:197-201):
44     Chapter   3. Phonology(58)       /j/~/d’/~/é/ alternations
           Subject nominalizer                 -jon   ~    -d’on    ~    -éon

           Purposive (‘go in order to’)        -jr    ~    -d’ej-   ~    -Ge7-
In word-final position, suffix-initial /7/ alternates with /i/, /¢/;
these alternations are restricted to three morphological items: the
transitive LPL marker -j, the intransitive third person marker -},
and the allomorph -j of the Active Attributive marker -j£ (see
61.1.1, 6.4.2.1).
     Partly, these alternations are motivated             by the phonotactics,
since /j/ cannot be the final consonant of a consonant cluster
(see 2.2). This case is described in 3.3.1. In other cases, the same
alternations must be described as morphophonemic, since they are
restricted to closed classes of lexical items and/or morphological
environments (see 3.3.2, 3.3.3)3.3.1. Phonologically motivated alternations3.3.1.1.      According to general restrictions on consonant             clusters
(see 2.2), intervocalic /j/ alternates with /d’/ in syllable-initial

with /é/ after voiceless obstruents.

ble, namely, the intranstive 3sG marker -7 and the transtive 1PL

/d’/-allomorphs of the suffixes listed in (58) occur with quite a
number of vowel-final verb stems, i.e., in the absence of the phono-
logical conditions which might have determined the alternation.
These cases fall into several groups: /d’/-allomorphs are used af-
ter the Resultative marker -o- (6.3.6.1):

"3.2.2.     Thetic clauses
SF marking is employed in order to impose the so-called thetic,
or presentational, articulation (Kuroda 1972, Sasse 1987), that
is, to present a state of affairs (an event together with the enti-
ties involved in this event} as a unitary whole, without analysis
into two “packaging” units corresponding to the notions of sub-
ject (topic) and predicate (comment).                Roughly, these are clauses
which can serve as appropriate answers to questions like ‘What
has happened?’. Thetic clauses signal some sort of discourse dis-
continuity, Le., the event described by a thetic clause does not
belong to any coherent chain of actions (Krejnovich 1982:214).

3.2.3. Delimiting function of the OF marking
A broad scope of assertion including a non-contrastive O con-
stituent allows both packaging options. The Focus variant seems
to be applied in order to contrast the assertion rendered by the
given clause and the previously introduced information, so that the
Focus NP identifies the left “boundary” of the assertion. If there is
no pragmatically motivated boundary immediately before the O
466      Chapter   12.   Nominal   predicates   and grammatical   Focusconstituent, the neutral variant is likely to be chosen. This strat-
egy of information structuring works both on the clause-internal
(3.2.3.1) and on the interclausal levels (3.2.3.2).
3.2.3.1.     Clause-internal structuring.                    If a clause contains 4 nom-
inal A constituent, two alternative information structures can be
distinguished: First, the clause can be constructed as providing
information about the A participant (that is, the A constituent is
taken to be the topic of that clause and excluded from the scope
of assertion). Secondly, the event can be presented as a unitary
whole and opposed to the previously introduced information.
   The first type of information structure is encoded by means of
the Focus packaging option (802). For instance, the second clause
in (802a) is intended to provide the relevant information about the
cuckoo (it was sent to call other birds, because it was a polyglot),
hence the Focus packaging variant.

               language-PRED know-OF:3SG}
               ‘In order to call these, they sent the cuckoo. The
               cuckoo knew eighteen bird languages.’ [F5]

               get.caught-CAUS:ITER-OF:38G}
               ‘The rich person was fishing ...’ [F46]
The second type of information structure is likely to occur if the
(transitive) event as a whole is opposed to some background in-
formation. A characteristic environment is the context of a con-
ditional construction (803), where the main clause as a whole is
opposed to the conditional setting (roughly, it can be conceived
of as an answer to a question like ‘What will happen if...’). In
this situation, the most significant information-structuring bound-

than between the A constituent and the O constituent of the main
clause (as would have been implied by Focus marking), hence the
neutral packaging option:*?

               ‘If you see that my coat is not fastened there, this will
               mean that I have killed this prince.’ [F50]
The     same    mechanism          can     be applied            to exclude     other   (non-
primary)       clause-initial constituents from the scope of assertion,
as illustrated by (804) and by the first clause in (802a).

initial, the same distinction operates on the interclausal level. The
neutral packaging option construes the main clause as a part of
a coherent information flow (805), while the Focus variant signals
some sort of discourse discontinuity between the Focus-marking
clause and the preceding one, i.e., the event is presented as un-
expected (806a) and/or implies a sort of semantic contrast to the
preceding material (806b).

3.2.4.   Pronominal          Focus
Focus marking must be applied to signal that a pronominal $/O
constituent is included in the scope of assertion. This marking is
needed to override the “default” topic interpretation of a pronoun
(which is implied by the neutral packaging variant). For example,
the second clause in (807a) is intended to provide further infor-
mation about some bird (the dropped subject of the first clause);
yet, if not for the Focus marking, it would have been interpreted as
providing information about the man (referred to by the demon-
strative pronoun). Similarly, both clauses in (807a) are meant
to explain why the speaker and his companions have come, not to
provide information about the referent of the pronoun (the son-in-
law), hence, the Focus marking of the highly accessible pronominal
referent in the second clause.

470      Chapter    12.   Naminal    predicates   and grammatical     FocusThus, Focus marking treats pronominal O constituents in the same
way as S constituents (3.2.2), that is, it is applied to signify inclu-
sion in the scope of assertion, independently of the factors outlined
in 3.2.3 for non-pronominal O constituents. The examples in (808)
show that the OF marking of a pronoun does not imply any sort
of discontinuity or contrast between the given clause and the pre-
viously introduced information.

The functional               account        of SF marking presented                     in 3.2.2 im-
plies that the existential semantics should obligatorily involve
this marking. This is indeed the case for text-internal existen-

On the other hand, text-initial existential clauses without clause-
initial adverbials normally take the neutral form. The examples
in (811) illustrate the typical structure of the beginning of a nar-
rative: (811)    a. pulun-die     l’e-9          terike-n’-t.

Thus, SF marking is applied only if there is some preceding ma-
terial; otherwise, the neutral variant is chosen even for existential
clauses, where the S constituent is “by definition” included in the
scope of assertion. This evidence seems to indicate that SF mark-
ing serves the same delimiting function as described in 3.2.3 for OF
marking. If there is nothing to be delimited from (or contrasted
to), as in (811), this packaging option is not applied.
Chapter          13
Sentence types and negation
This chapter deals with grammatical manifestation of illocutionary
distinctions (Sections 1-3) and negation (Section 4). Yukaghir
distinguishes Declarative sentences (which are not discussed as
such), Imperative sentences (Section 1), polar (2.1) and question-
word questions (2.2), and two minor types: Exclamations (3.1)
and Optative sentences (3.2).
    The verb forms used in major sentence types are described in
6.1.1; this chapter is concerned with syntactic properties associ-
ated with distinct types, in particular, their characteristic particles
(2.1.2, 2.1.3, 3.2).
    Section 5 describes the syntactic strategies of reporting the con-
tents of a speech act, including the attested peripheral uses of these
strategies.","[484, 485, 486, 487, 488, 489, 490, 491, 492, 493]"

responds to the the primary (735b) or the secondary (735a) par-
ticipant of the complement situation. The complement situation
remains an obligatory element of the sentence. With the verb
aja-re-, this situation can be specified either by the Imperfective SS

by the Supine clause (736).°?

               her.’ [I]3. Relative               clauses
There are two types of constructions involving a non-finite clause
as a noun modifier, Nominal relative construction and Attributive
relative construction. In the Nominal relative clause the subject
of the relative clause is construed as the grammatical Possessor of
a nominal verb form. In the Attributive relative clause, this is not
the case; on the contrary, the subject of the relative clause can be
construed as the grammatical Possessor of the relativized NP (see
9.1.2.1 for examples).
   Nomina! relative clauses are formed by the Action Nominal
form or by the Result Nominal form. Attributive relative clauses
are formed by means of the dedicated Attributive forms (6.1.2)
or the Action Nominal form. Thus, the Action Nominal is used
in both relativization strategies. These constructions are formally
distinguished by the placement of the Possessive marker cross-
referencing the subject of the relative clause: in the Attributive
                                                          Relative clauses   417relative construction, it is placed on the head noun, in the Nominal
relative construction, on the verb form itself.
    The Attributive relative clause is the primary relativization
strategy, i.e., this strategy is used for subject relativization (3.1).
The Nominal relative clause plays a rather marginal role and is
employed primarily for relativization of spatial and temporal ad-
verbials (3.2).","[435, 436, 437]"
" 1.2. Proprietive clauses
1.2.1. Semantics of the Proprietive clauses
A nominal predicate can be represented by an NP in the Propri-
etive form (5.5.5.1). In this construction, the Proprietive predicate
introduces an entity which is associated with the entity represented
by the subject as a possession (774), a part (775), a relative (776),
or something located in the place (777). The latter pattern can
be used with general] existential meaning, with unspecified subject
(778).

Nominative NP representing the subject of a Proprietive clause
can be replaced by a Locative NP with the same semantic inter-
pretation. Note that such constructions are not confined to the
locative use of the pattern (cf. {777))

the Proprietive form (which is normally controlled by the subject);
this construction does not occur with the first or second person
448      Chapter 12.   Nominal predicates   and grammatical   FocusLocative.

1.3.1. Transformative clauses
A transformative clause links a referential entity and a description
of its state obtained as a result of some process. The referential
entity may be represented as the 5 participant (1.3.1.1) or the O
participant (1.3.1.2).
1.3.1.1. Intransitive transformative clauses are formed by means
of the verb kude- ‘become’; the slot for the description of the
resulting state of the subject referent is filled by an NP in the
Transformative form (783) (5.5.5.3) or, less often, by an adverb
(784):

verb nugede- ‘makc, behave in some way with respect to somebody’
(785), or with the verb a- ‘make’ (786).

1.3.2.     Privative clauses
Privative clauses follow the same distribution pattern as the Trans-
formative clauses: they describe a resulting state of the S partici-
pant (1.3.2.1) or the O participant (1.3.2.2). This state is described
as absence of some associated entity and is normally expressed by
means of the Privative form of a noun (5.5.2).
1.3.2.1.      Intransitive       Privative      clauses   are constructed   with   the
copula kude- ‘become’ or the verb pon’o- ‘remain’:
 (787)      a. tat     kereke-pul      and’e       el+Soromo+éugn
               CA Koryak-PL            prince      NEG+person+PRIV

               ‘So, the prince of the Koryaks was left without (his)
               people.’ |F50]
           b. mit      el+end’on+éugn                  pon’o-jl%

               ‘We are left without animals.’ {F9]
In some examples, there is no postnominal Privative marker, and
the same meaning is rendered just by means of the negative prefix
attached to a bare noun stem:
 (788)      a, met     kende-l-ge                 el+anil         kude-je

2.1. Introductory remarks
This grammar treats the grammatical Focus as a constituent of
the finite clause, i.e., the Focus is considered as a clause-internal
syntactic phenomenon         (9.1.1).   This analysis is motivated by a
number of considerations which are summarized in 2.2.
   On the other hand, the morphology employed for Focus mark-
ing shows its obvious formal similarity to cleft and cleft-like con-
structions in other languages:   e An NP receives Predicative marking, which is also employed
     for nominal predicates (see 9.1.1 and 1.1.1).
   e The finite verb form is deranked by the same formal means
         that are applied for relativization (see 9.1.1 and 11.3.1).
It might therefore be suggested that the Focus construction should
be analyzed as a combination of a clause-external constituent and
a free relative clause. Furthermore, there are two types of con-
structions which apparently favor the clause-external analysis of
the grammatical Focus (2.3-2.4).
   This combination of properties indicates that the Focus con-
struction is a result of grammaticalization of a cleft-like structure,
a typologically quite frequent source for Focus constructions.
452     Chapter   12.   Nominal   predicates   and grammatical   Focus2.2. Focus as a clause-internal phenomenon:                              summary
The grammatical Focus in Yukaghir exhibits a number of syntactic
features which identify it as a clause-internal phenomenon:
      « The word order in the Focus construction not only maintains
        the regularities attested in other clause types, but even ad-
        heres to them more strictly, that is to say, the Focus NP is not
        split off from the remainder of the clause. In particular, the
        A constituent cannot intervene between the Focus and the
        verb form (see 9.1.5.1). This linearization rule can be viewed
        as grammaticalization of the information-packaging function
        of Focus marking, which implies that the presupposed mate-
        rial (in particular, the topic) should precede the Focus (see
        Section 3). On the other hand, it is in obvious contradic-
        tion with a cleft-like analysis, which would suggest that the
        A constituent belongs to a free relative clause.
      e The   accessibility constraints                on Focus          marking   are much
        stronger        than   those on relativization;              in particular,   the A
        constituent is accessible for relativization (11.3.1.1), but not
        for the Focus marking (9.1.1.1). The Focus marking is orga-
        nized in such a way as to ensure the unique identification of
        the clause-internal role of the NP: it can be applied only to
        one participant role per clause type.
      e The Focus S constituent maintains the syntactic properties
        associated with the subjects (9.1.4.1, 2.4}.
      e The SF and OF forms of the verb, in contrast with the simi-
        lar forms used for relativization, have the full range of finite
        morphology (see 6.1.2.1, 6.1.3.2).
These properties suggest that the Focus in Yukaghir is grammati-
calized as a clause-internal phenomenon: the strong syntactic con-
straints on Focus marking are not motivated by the constraints on
relativization, nor by the Focus semantics per se. Rather, they
are targeted at integrating the Focus into the clause-internal syn-
tax, so that the Focus marking unambiguously assigns the NP to
a clause-internal function (participant role).
                                              Syntaz of the Focus construction   4532.3.     Cleft-like constructions
The Focus construction may contain, although rather infrequently,
a demonstrative pronoun in the Nominative form which is not as-
signed to any clause-internal function and can be analyzed only
as the subject associated with the Predicative NP according to
the descriptive pattern (1.1.1).           Consequently, the remainder of
the construction should be analyzed as a free relative clause. The
sentence in (790a} illustrates the OF construction with a demon-
strative pronoun, (790b), the SF construction.
 (790)     a. jug-k            adugn. tei-ek       anci-yile
              see-IMP:28G | this        you-PRED search-3PL:OF
              ‘Look, it is you that they are looking for.’ [K5]
           b. adugn    aleksej-die     CunZe-l
              this       A.-DIM      whistle-SF
              ‘It is Aleksej that is whistling.’
It should be stressed that the demonstrative pronoun in such a
construction is not a “dummy subject”, i.e., it always refers to
some actual phenomenon in the situation of speech. In (790),
the demonstrative refers to a situation taking place at the time
of speech (calling somebody in (790a), whistling in (790b)). In
(791), the demonstrative has an entity referent (a dog found by
the speaker and his mother).
 (791)        emie,    tugn    Soromo-lek            touke+yot
              mother   that    person-PRED          [dog-TRNSF
              kude-delle            ejrie-lel-u-l
              become-Ss:PFV|        come-INFR-0-SF
              ‘Mother, this one has turned out to be a human being
              which has transformed into a dog.’ [F20]
However, other types of NPs are impossible in this position (e.g.,
in (791), the demonstrative pronoun cannot be replaced by an NP
like ‘that dog’),
   The construction observes all constraints on the Focus con-
struction outlined in 2.2: Predicative marking can be applied only
to the S/O participant; the A constituent cannot take the linear
454      Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focusposition between         the Focus and the verb form,            i.e., it is either
postposed       (792a) or precedes the Focus (thus taking the posi-
tion between the demonstrative pronoun and the Predicative NP,
(792b)).
 (792)     a. tugn     lem-dik         uj-met             tit?
               that what-PRED make-OF:2PL                 you
               ‘What is it that you are doing?’
           b. adugn tet cidetke-lek jug-l’el-me
              this     you C-PRED       see-INFR-OF:2SG
              ‘It is Chechetka that you have seen.’
However, this construction gives a piece of syntactic evidence in fa-
vor of the clause-external origin of the grammatical Focus, insofar
as the demonstrative pronouns manifest the presence of the sub-
ject slot (which can be attributed to the main clause with nominal
predicate, but cannot. be accounted for under the clause-internal
analysis of the Focus).
   On the other hand, this construction could have become possi-
ble under the influence of Russian, where the demonstrative pro-
noun eto ‘it, this’ is regularly used to highlight the focus; in partic-
ular, this pronoun appears in the Russian translations of the sen-
tences like (791)-(792) provided by the Yukaghir narrators. Thus,
such sentences appear to combine the Yukaghir and the Russian
tools for focus marking. Notably, such examples have not been
attested in previous descriptions of the Yukaghir Focus (which are
based on earlier data), which can be taken as a piece of indirect
evidence in favor of this hypothesis.","[464, 465, 466, 467, 468, 469, 470, 471, 472, 473, 474]"
"1. Imperative          sentences
The imperative sentence type is distinguished by means of verb
morphology, that is, by use of the Imperative verb forms (see
6.1.1). Therefore, this sentence type is described and exemplified
in 6.2.8; this section contains only some marginal notes.
    In order to propose a common action (i.e., instead of the 1PL
Imperative), the main (Indicative) 1PL form can be used, with or,
less frequently, without the Future marker (see also 6.2.3).

               ‘Then let us prepare everything.’ [F31]
With the second person Imperative, the particle jag ‘come (on)’
can be used:
 (813)     a. jag gon             logkara Sobohora kes’t-k

               ‘Come on, go quickly and bring water.’ [F29]

               ‘Children, go, tie your cow and give it to
               grandfather.’ [F27|
This particle can be etymologically related to the verb jaqa- ‘ar-
rive, reach’.
    The subject of the Imperative is normally omitted (813), yet
this is not an obligatory feature of this sentence type (814).
 (814)     a. id% tet met-ul Sgrile-
              now you I-ACC paint-CAUS(IMP:2SG)

               ‘Always eat!’ [F9]
See 6.2.8 for further examples.
   The Imperative is incompatible                  with     the grammatical       Focus
marking (6.1.1.2).

The ordinary polar question (yes-no question) is not marked mor-
phologically; the interrogative meaning is expressed only by a ris-
ing intonation contour (Krejnovich 1982:150). A question can have
the form of an affirmative (815) or negative (816) clause:

If the disjoined alternatives are an assertion and its negation, the
latter can be represented by the negative form of the existential
verb, oj-l’e (lit. ‘there is no’); see (818). In this case, the disjunc-
tive particle can be absent from the first clause (819a), or from
both clauses (819b).

explicitly expressed alternative:

This particle can also be used in declarative contexts. In two
examples in my corpus, it is used clause-internally in order to
disjoin constituents of a declarative clause (821). In one example,
it is used to disjoin declarative clauses (822).

2.1.3. The contrastive/negative particle eil’e
The particle efl’e has the general semantic effect of contrasting two
propositions, one of which remains implicit. The implicit propo-
sition is presented as false, in contrast with that expressed by the
clause. This particle is used in Indicative sentences (2.1.3.1), in
tag questions (2.1.3.2), and for negative responses (2.1.3.3).
2.1.3.1. In Indicative sentences, the clause-final particle ell’e is
used to contrast the proposition expressed in the clause to what
might be presupposed (823a), apparently evident {823b), expected
(823c), or desired (823d):

              ‘Our place was far away, after all (however willing we
              were to reach it).’2.1.3.2. This particle can be used for a sort of tag question. It
signifies that the proposition expressed by the clause is assumed
by the speaker to be true, and contrasts this assumption with the
potential negative response.

dialogue; the previous turn can be either an assertion (825a) or a
polar question (825b).

2.1.4. Ask-to-repeat verb
There      is a special           verb   used    for requests      to repeat         the previ-
ous utterance          (Krejnovich          1982:151).      Such     requests are built
as questions containing only the second person form of the verb
monohot-""4 (cf. mon- ‘say’):
 (826)         tay      para-ge            tat   mon-de-ge         irk-in
               [that time-LOC              CA    say-3SG-Ds]       one-ATTR

               ‘At that time, when he said this, the One-eyed one
               replied: “Wow, what have you said?”’ [F31]
Note that the same function can be fulfilled by means of a question-
word question with the basic speech act verb mon- ‘say’:
 (827)         e-e     Saget        lem-dik         = mon-me?
               Int]    now         what-PRED         say-OF:2SG
               ‘Hi, what have you just said?’ [F31]2.2.     Question-word questions
2.2.1. Questioning constituents of the main clause
Any constituent of the clause can be questioned (see 7.1.3 for in-
terrogative pro-forms used for such questions}. The linear position
                                                                Questions   481of the question word is rather flexible; it can occur either in the
position most typical for the constituent type (831b), (832b) or be
sentence-initial; see (830b), (831a).°%
   The verb normally takes the Interrogative form (see 6.1.1.1);
however,   the Indicative main      forms    are also possible;      see, e.g.,
(828b), (835a), with the exception of first-person forms which can
be only Interrogative. Questions to the S/O constituent obliga-
torily involve Focus marking, including the Focus-indicating verb
form. The following examples illustrate question-word questions
to other types of constituents.%

The descriptive nominal predicate (see 72.1.1) can be questioned
by putting an interrogative pronoun in the predicative position:
(838)   a. neme-pe-lek?
           what-PL-PRED
           ‘Who are they?’ [F31]
        b. tugn    tet-ke        neme-lek?
           this    you-LOC       what-PRED
           ‘What’s up with you?’ (F54]
484      Chapter 18.     Sentence   types and negation            Cc.   kin+y0-k?
                  who+CoOP-ITR:28G
                  ‘Who are you?’
The verbal predicate can be questioned by means of the combina-
tion of the question word godo ‘how’ with the verb a- ‘make’ or
l’e- ‘be’ (see 7.1.3). The former option is employed when both the
A participant and the O participant of the action being questioned
are specified or implied (839), the latter, if only one participant
is specified, independently of its role in the situation being ques-
tioned, i.e., such a question can mean both ‘What did/will X do?’
(840) and ‘What happened/will happen to X?’ (841).                         The neg-
ative marker on such a complex signifies negation of a possible
situation involving specified participants (841b).

illustrate questions to the possessive modifier (842), the attributive

Constituents of non-finite clauses can be questioned, yet such ex-
amples are rather rare:

 2.3. Negative/dubitative use of questions
The form of a question-word question can be used to negate the
proposition expressed by the clause, or to present it as doubtful.
In the combination with the Future form of the verb (6.2.3), this
gives the meaning of impossibility or at least crucial complications
in accomplishing the action. The question word of manner godo
gives a more general meaning                  (847), other question words can
be conceived as specifying a particular component of a situation
which is lacking (848).
(847) a. inluge             met    ner         naha     eris’                 godo

               ‘What will reach it? (= there is nothing that can reach
               it).’ [F58]
If there is no Future marker, a question-like clause with godo can
express just somewhat emphasized negation (849), a clause with
noyon ‘what for’, the absence of reason (purposelessness) of the
action that has taken place (850).

yet the clause normally contains a word providing the “answer” to
the formally questioned element (cf. ‘what’ and ‘good’ in (851a),
‘how’ and ‘well’ in (851b)):

"1.3.3. Structural ambiguity of clause chains
The structural options outlined in 1.3.1-1.3.2 are distinguishable
only if the chain contains an NP which demonstrably belongs to
the controlling clause, but not to the switch-reference clause, since
the linear position of such an NP can indicate the degree of struc-
tural cohesion between clauses. Yet most instances of clause chain-
ing simply do not contain NPs which would be able to signal the
type of structure involved. This structural ambiguity is a direct
consequence of two basic syntactic properties of Yukaghir, the ex-
tensive use of zero anaphora and the verb-final order.
   Indeed, if a shared participant with nonconstant case role is
380      Chapter 10.   Clause chainingomitted, the distinction between the linear and the nesting struc-
ture (see 1.3.1.1) is neutralized, cf. (690) and (687).

               ‘He came closer to the fireplace, and she recognized
               hin.’
On the other hand, if all participants of the controlling clause sit-
uation are involved in the switch-reference clause situation in the
same case roles (691), they are likely to precede all verb forms
independently of the structural option involved. Given the verb-
final word order, a chain-initial NP representing a shared partic-
ipant may be taken to belong to either clause (and be dropped
in the other), or otherwise to the merged complex as a whole (as
in (689)). In (691), the linear analysis is represented with square
brackets, the nesting analysis, with curly brackets.

The structural ambiguity of most ordinary chains appears to be
an essential property of this strategy of clause linking (rather than
an artifact of inadequate tools of syntactic analysis). Instead of a
strict formal opposition between co-ordination and subordination,
the clause-chaining offers a rather flexible device for combining
clauses exhibiting various degrees of backgrounding and semantic
cohesion (see 2.3-2.4).

2.1,    General semantic properties and “loose” chaining
Ordinary chaining involves three semantic properties:
  1. The      clause chain     expresses      temporal relations between          the
        situations (a switch-reference clause situation can be either
        prior to or simultaneous with the controlling clause situation);
        see 2.2.","[399, 400, 401]"
"1.3.3. Transitive speech act verbs
Nominal complementation can be used to express the contents of
reported speech with transitive speech act verbs (see £3.5.1-13.5.2
for an overview of the strategies employed for this purpose). With
these verbs, the Result Nominal complements are more frequent,
presumably because the event being reported normally precedes
the event of speech (see 1.1). The subject of the complement clause
can (721a) but need not (721b) be coreferential with the subject
of the matrix clause; it can be omitted in the complement clause.

1.3.4. Verbs of cognition
The verbs of cognition take complements constructed by means of
the Action Nominal (722a), the Result Nominal (722b), and the
Prospective Nominal        (722c).    The subject of the complement can
be either coreferential (722c) or non-coreferential (722a)-(722b)
with the subject of the matrix clause.

1.3.5. Other complement-taking verbs
The nominal complements occur with some other transitive verbs;
the only semantic feature these verbs have in common is that
they do not imply realization of the complement situation (723).
The subject of the complement clause can be either coreferential
408      Chapter     Lf.   Subordination(723b)-{723c) or non-coreferential (723a} with the subject of the
matrix clause.

In a few examples, the complement co-occurs with an ordinary
NP filling the same valence slot of the complement-taking verb.
In such constructions, the complement takes the postverbal linear
position, while the more common preverbal position is occupied by
the ordinary NP. The sentences in (724) illustrate the case where
the O slot is filled by an ordinary NP and the clause is followed
by the complement with the subject referentially identical to that
NP. Note that this is the only (and extremely rare) construction
type that allows the reflexive possessive pronoun representing the
subject of a Nominal clause to be controlled by the direct. object
(and not by the subject) of the matrix clause (724a):
                                                               Nominal   complements     409 (724)     a. margil’     tude-gele        Cugte      mie-nunnu-m                 tude

              ‘The girl was always waiting for him, for him to return

           b. mit     emd’e       Gohoée    budie-t            mit-kele       jug-m

              ‘Our brother saw us fishing from the hill.’ [K5]
On the other hand, examples (725) show that this referential iden-
tity is not a necessary condition for such a construction; (725a)
illustrates the detached complement semantically associated with
the O slot, (725b), with the S slot. Unfortunately, such examples
are too rare for any detailed description.

The verb medu- ‘be heard, perceivable’ and its aspectual deriva-
tives can take the complement in the S slot (716a}, according to
the construction schema outlined in 1.2. This section describes an-
other pattern which is only possible with medu- and its aspectual
410      Chapter if.   Subordinationderivatives. In this construction, the primary participant of the
complement situation fills the 5 slot of the matrix clause, while the
Action Nominal takes the Instrumental form (lit. ‘X is perceivable
by/with V-ing’).”® The subject NP is obligatorily omitted in the
complement clause. This pattern contains an optional slot for the
Dative Experiencer in the matrix clause (726b), (727a) (sce 9.2.7).
However, the experiencer is most commonly introduced by means
of a non-finite clause of perception (726a), (727b) (see 10.2.4.3).

This construction is particularly common with the Action Nominal
of the verb kel- ‘come’ (727a)-(727b) and other verbs of movement

such verbs the meaning of the verb medu- is extended to cover

1.6.     Complements in the Directional slot
The verbs aja- ‘be glad, rejoice (at/over)’ and kidie- ‘learn (how
to)’ open the Directional slot (9.2.6.1) for a NP signifying a pro-
cess. It may be either the pronoun tamnun ‘that’ (728a) or a nomi-
nal complement (728b), (729). According to the general properties
of the Directional slot, this NP can take the Dative (728) or the
Locative (729) case form.

These verbs have an alternative pattern where the complement
situation is represented by a converb (2.1).","[426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 431, 432]"
"3.2.2. Free reciprocal markers
A free reciprocal marker can be built by combining the reciprocal
prefix n’e- and a postposition (see 7.3 for postpositions attested in
such combinations). Such items are used instead of the Reciprocal
marking on the verb (sec 6.4.5.2) if the reciprocal participants
correspond to the subject argument of the verb and the argument
of the postposition:

              ‘Our tents were near each other.’
The reciprocal marker made up of the interior postposition molho
(in the Prolative form, see 7.3.1.4.1) can be used with natural
reciprocals (cf. 6.4.5.2.2, 2.8) in order to stress that the action
involves only members of the group construed as the $ participant
of the situation:

n’aha can also function as a free reciprocal marker (674c).

Clause chaining
Yukaghir has no grammatical means to create a coordinate struc-
ture of two (or more) finite clauses.°? The only strategy of clause
conjunction® is clause chaining, that is, a structure in which one
(typically final) clause contains a finite verb form, and each non-
final clause is marked to indicate whether or not it has the same
subject as the controlling clause (typically, the next. clause in the
chain) (Longacre 1985:264). As in other chaining languages, clause
chaining in Yukaghir neutralizes the distinction between clause co-
ordination and subordinate adverbial clauses (Longacre 1985:239),
that is, it may be employed both to conjoin clauses and to mod-
ify the proposition rendered by the finite clause.®* In particular,
clause chaining is employed in conditional (Section 3) and conces-
sive constructions (Section 4).","[386, 387, 388, 389]"
" Terminological note.    In the syntactic chapters of this book,
     the term “Predicative marking” is applied to cases like (605)
     as well, that is, I will not make the reservations concern-
     ing Anaphoric NPs at all points where Focus marking is
     mentioned,   Similar terminological conventions are applied
     to other case marking options: the term “Neutral marking”
     refers to the second marking option in the list above (Nomina-
     tive for third-person NPs, Pronominal Accusative for first and
     second person pronouns). Thus, Neutral marking is opposed
     to Nominative marking, where the Nominative case is used
     independently of the person. The term “Accusative marking”
     is applied to refer to the third marking option, independently
     of the particular case employed.**1.1.2. Intransitive finite clauses: split intransitivity
The single core participant of a finite intransitive clause (S) can
either take the Nominative form or be marked as the grammatical
Focus of the clause. The latter option involves the Predicative
marking of the NP (5.4.1.3) and the choice of the sFparadigm for
the finite verb (6.1.1.2). These options are exemplified in 5.4.1.2
and 5.4.1.3.   Thus, Yukaghir appears to show a special (“Focus-
oriented”) case of split intransitivity:> the S participant takes ei-
ther Nominative marking {associated with the A participant in a
328      Chapter 9. Syntaz of the clausetransitive clause) or Predicative marking (associated with the O
participant in a transitive clause).
      These marking properties naturally give rise to the following
question: Which grammatical units (if any) can be associated with
syntactic functions (or grammatical relations), such as subject,
direct object, etc.; in other words, do the participant roles identify
the syntactic functions, or are these functions identifiable only for
a given packaging variant? To put the question straightforwardly,
is it only the Nominative (non-Focus) primary participant (A/S)
that can be identified as the subject of a clause, or is subjecthood
maintained for the Predicative (Focus) S as well?
   The former analysis might appear more plausible not only on
morphological grounds, but also on the basis of functional con-
siderations, inasmuch as some sort of topichood is generally asso-
ciated with subjects. It appears, however, that Yukaghir gram-
mar assigns the subject properties to the primary participant role
(A/S), be it the Focus or not, rather than to the Nominative (non-
Focus) A/S. That is to say, the syntactic generalizations of the
type cross-linguistically associated with “subjects” are to be stated
over the participant roles, without regard for the Focus marking.
Various syntactic constructions that substantiate this claim are de-
scribed in different parts of this grammar; see 1.4 for a summary
of this evidence.","[347, 348]"
"
2.2.2.    Verbs
Verbs fall into two major classes, transitive and intransitive. Each
class has two series of Indicative finite forms, for main clauses
which are neutral with respect to grammatical Focus (Main forms)
and for clauses with intransitive subject (S) or direct object (O}
marked for grammatical Focus (SF and OF forms, respectively).
The finite verb agrees in person/number with the subject (the OF
paradigm and especially the SF paradigm are less distinctive than
the Main one). The Imperative is expressed by a distinct series
of forms, which are shared by transitive and intransitive verbs.
Illustrative paradigms are given in Table 3 (for the verbs modo-
‘sit, stay’ and a- ‘makc’).
     There are Interrogative forms which are used only in question-
word questions in which the questioned constituent is not S/O (in
the latter case, the respective Focus-indicating forms are used).
For the first person subject, there arc special Interrogative person
markers, -m 18G, -ok IPL. The second and third person Interroga-
tive forms differ from the Main Indicative forms only in absence of
the (in)transitivity morphs -j/e)- / -m(e)- (e.g., (qodo) a-k ‘(how)
you (8G) made’, (godo) a-met ‘(how) you (PL) made’, (godo) a
‘(how) he made’, (godo) a-ni ‘(how) they made’).
   The verb morphology is clearly aspect-dominated; the regularly
marked aspect. meanings are Imperfective, Ingressive, Resultative,
and Habitual:

       Imperfective  -nu-         a-nu-m ‘he is/was making,

       Habitual             -nun(nu)-        d-nunnu-m    ‘he used to make’

       Resultative           -of)-           d-l-o-j ‘it is made’
The only obligatorily marked tense distinction is Future vs. Non-
Future (the suffix -te-~-t- for Future, zero marking for Non-
Future), although the Past may be expressed through periphrastic
verb forms. The Periphrastic Past is built by putting the Subject
Nominal or Relative Nominal verb form in the predicative posi-
tion:(3)    Tense marking:
       Non-Future               a-™                    ‘he is making/made’
       Future                   a-te-m                 ‘he will make’

Inferential (the marker is -l’el-), Prospective (-moZi:-), and Irre-
alis (marked by a pre-verbal morpheme ot-/et-). There is also a
Periphrastic Prospective form made up as a combination of the
Supine form with the existential verb l’e- ‘be’:(4)    Major Mood forms:
       Inferential          a-lel-u-m         ‘he appears to have made’

       Irrealis             ot+a-m            ‘he would have made’
       Periphrastic
       Prospective          a-din l’e-m       ‘he is about to make, is making’The verb has a rich system of various nonfinite forms. The major
nonfinite forms are illustrated in (5) by the verb SubeZe- ‘run’:

       Conditional converb      SubeZe-de-h-ne    ‘if he runs...’
There are four regular valence-changing means, the Reciprocal
(pre-verb n’e+), the Reflexive (pre-verb met--), the Causative (suf-
fixes -S-, -§-€il’e-), and the Resultative (-off)-), and a number of
nonproductive valence-changing suffixes.","[25, 26, 27]"
"4.1.2. The Nominative       case
The Nominative noun phrase represents the S participant (154),
the A participant (155), or the O participant.                  The latter use is
possible if A is 1** or 2°¢ person (156) and in a non-finite clause
(157).19

The Nominative is used with Possessive noun phrases (158), proper
nouns (159) and third person pronouns (160) in the predicative
function (158) and in the Focus function (159), (160) (see Chapter
12 for further details on these syntactic functions).

The      Nominative      non-Possessive        form    is used      as the possessive
modifier (see also 8.2.1-8.2.2):(161)      pulut numge             ‘old man’s house’
           met terike and’e        ‘my wife’s eyes’
           Eomparna azu            ‘language of ravens’The Nominative case is used for vocative noun phrases:
 (162)      — pulut,         mit   €olhoro      $ejre-s’
              old man,       our   hare         run.away-PFV:INTR:3SG
               ‘Old man, our hare has run away.’ [F13]
The Nominative case has some other uses which are described else-
where in the grammar: (a) argument of the copula (see 12.1.1.2),
(b) apposition (8.2.1.2), (c) argument of postpositions (7.3, 8.5.2).
                                                              Functions of the cases   914.1.3.   The Predicative case
The Predicative noun phrase is the nominal predicate (163) or the
Focus of a clause (Krejnovich 1982: 184; 232ff}. Only S (164)
and O (165) can acquire the Predicative marking (9.1.1.2; cf. also
Note 18). The Predicative case is incompatible with Possessive
noun phrases, proper names, and third person pronouns, which
take the Nominative case in these functions {see (158)-(160)).
 (163)         ujs >            omo-s’e           Soromo-lek

               ‘I will give you a fox.’ [F52]
The Predicative marker has two variants, -lek and-(e)k, which are
formally distinguished only with vowel-final stems and in the Plu-
ral form (see Table 10, 1.4.1). There is a clear functional dis-
tinction between these variants which subsumes two interrelated
factors:7°
    First, the short. variant is used if the narrow information focus
(e.g., the focus of contrast) falls on a modifier, rather than on the
noun phrase as awhole:
 (166)    a. kukki        vosemnadcat’             nodo   azu-k

            find-OF:38G
            ‘Then she went and found traces of other
            people.’ (F54]
The relevance of this factor is indirectly shown by the fact that
only the short variant is possible in question-word questions with
a question word modifying a noun (cf. £2.3.1.1):
 (167)      godi-mie      pajpe-k               L’e-t-u-l?
            what-QLT        woman-PRED          be-FUT-0-SF?
            ‘What woman would it be?’ [F49]
Secondly, the formal opposition in question is employed to express
the distinction between the true predicative and the referential use
of noun phrases. The Predicative noun phrase in -iek ascribes a
property to (i.e., classifies) some entity.In other words, an example
like (165) might be appropriately rendered as ‘The thing I will
give to you is a fox’. The variant in -ek signifies the referential use
(i.e., the Focus NP introduces a referential entity); this is shown
by the fact that only this variant can be used if the noun phrase
is modified by a numeral, in particular by the numeral irkin ‘one’:

The Accusative case is used to mark the O participant, under the
condition that A is third person (otherwise the Nominative case
is used, sce 4.1.2):
 (169)    a. éolhora-die-gele      ta        Sasil-ge

             ‘Your whip has killed me.’ [F19]
The Accusative marking is compatible with pronouns, proper
nouns, Possessive noun phrases and definite noun phrases (includ-
ing generic reference, as in (170a)); if a noun phrase is indefinite,
the Instrumental case is used instead (cf. Krejnovich 1982:254-255,
see also Note 21).
   There can be two Accusative noun phrases in a clause if some
kind of possessive or part-whole relationship holds between them
(cf. 5.4.2.2 for a designated body-part form).

(see 4.2.1, 9.2.4).

4.1.5. The Pronominal           Accusative     Case
First and second person pronouns have a special Pronominal Ac-
cusative form in -ul (see 7.1.1.1), which is used for the O partici-
pant under the same conditions as the Nominative form of nouns,
i.e., if A is first or second person (172a)-(172b), or, occasionally,
in non-finite clauses (172c) (cf. 4.1.2).

              ‘T’l give you feathers for you to fly.’
4.1.6. The Instrumental case: patient-marking function
The      Instrumental   case can be used     for the O participant           if A
is third person (i.e., under the same condition as the Accusative
marking, see 4.1.4). This marking is incompatible with definite
pronouns, Possessive noun phrases and proper nouns (in these
cases, only the Accusative marking is available).

96   Chapter 5.   Nominal   morphologyIn most cases, the Instrumental O marking is applied to unmod-
ified nouns,”! since the presence of a modifier either attracts the
Focus marking (see 4.1.3), or implies definiteness and licenses the
Accusative marking thereby (see 4.1.4). This is rather a tendency
than a rule, since in a few examples the Instrumental marking is
applied to definite (175a) and/or modified noun phrases (175b).

Like the Accusative (see (170)), the Instrumental case can mark
the whole if some part of it constitutes the O participant of the

The     Dative   marks    a peripheral       participant      that   is beneficially

In particular, the meaning of purpose is characteristic of the Action
Nominal Dative:
                                                       Functions of the cases   99(183)   a. jagte-lL-yin           gon-t

See 6.1.3.3, 17.4.4 for functions of the “frozen” Action Nominal
Possessive Dative (Supine).
    The Dative marking can be doubled,whereby the second Da-
tive (normally, the Possessive Dative form) is used to specify the
direction more precisely. The following examples illustrate this
phenomenon for a body part (184a) and for the Possessive form
of the AD-postposition al’ (see 7.3.1.1.1):
(184)   a. éul-e             juko-d’on-ben-die-lek

                   ‘The hare and the old man worked the whole day from
               dawn to dusk.’ [F3]
In one example, the Dative is used temporally in the combination
with the Russian preposition do ‘until’:
 (186)             do     ugujel-yin           = mie-de-7i

               ‘They waited until the morning.’ [F36]
The Dative constitutes an element of some verb patterns (9.2.4,
9.2.6) and is used within the Body-Part form (see 4.2.2); see also
8.1.1 for its marginal use as a noun modifier.","[109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120]"
"1.4.   Grammatical relations
This section summarizes the syntactic properties which can iden-
tify the grammatical relations in Yukaghir.            It is shown that the
subject properties in Yukaghir are associated with the primary
participant, independently of the Focus marking. On the contrary,
there are no behavioral properties which would be associated with
the Nominative A/S          participant alone (in contrast to the Focus $
participant and other types of constituents, see 1.1.2). On the ba-
sis of this evidence, it can be assumed that the syntactic functions
have to be identified on the level of participants, without regard
to Focus marking.
   Sections 1.4.2-1.4.3 summarize the syntactic properties which
may distinguish the syntactic functions of direct object (O partic-
ipant of transitive clause} and indirect object (Dative participant
of ditransitive clause).
   All relevant constructions are described elsewhere in the gram-
mar. This section can serve as an index to the respective parts of
the grammar.
                             Core participants   and grammatical   relations       3391.4.1. Subject properties (A/S participant)
The following properties are shared by the primary participants
of transitive and intransitive clauses. Some of these properties are
manifested in non-finite clauses, where the Focus marking is not
available; others are insensitive to the Focus S vs. Nominative
A/S distinction, i.e., they are demonstrably valid for both types
of NPs. Hence, all these properties are independent of the Focus
marking.  e The primary participant (A/S) controls the agreement mark-
    ers on the finite forms (6.1.1), Passive Attributive forms
    (6.1.2.3) and pDsforms (6.1.4.1.1).    Although in the sF
     paradigm   the number   of opposed forms is severely reduced
     (it distinguishes only two forms instead of six, see 6.1.1.1),
     the S participant still controls the only remaining agreement
     marker (the Plural marker -y-).
  e The primary participant controls clause-internal coreference
     phenomena,   i.e., Reflexive and Reciprocal marking                       (6.4.5)
     and the reflexive possessive pronouns           (see 7.1.1.2), see also
     14.1.1.
  e The primary participant is encoded as the Possessor in Nomi-
     nal and Attributive relative clauses (1.2.1). Consequently, the
     choice of the possessive pronoun vs. bound Possessive mark-
     ing for this participant is controlled by its coreference with
     the primary participant of the matrix clause (see 14.1.2).
  e The primary participant is obligatorily deleted in the Supine
    Adverbial clause (see 1.4.2).
  e The primary participant controls the switch-reference mark-
    ers in clause chains. This appears to be the most significant
    piece of evidence in favor of the subjecthood of the S Focus
    constituent; indeed, the switch reference seems to be most
    liable to be affected by the Focus marking, since it has to do
    with referent tracking, hence with topicality. However, this
    proves not to be the case: the primary participant controls
340      Chapter 9. Syntaz of the clause        the switch-reference markers independently of whether or not
        it is marked as Focus (see 12.2.4, 4.1.3.3).
      e There is only one, and rather marginal, relation-changing pro-
        cedure which promotes the O participant into the $ position,
        namely, the Resultative {see 6.3.5.6.2). This procedure does
        not interact with Focus marking.","[358, 359, 360]"

The Imperfective converb of cardinal verbs is used to specify the
number of primary participants (in fact, this is the most frequent
use of these verbs):
(498)    a. ja-lo-t                kewe-j-nun-d’il’t
            [three-VR-SS:IPFV]     go-PFV-HAB-INTR:1PL
            “The three of them used to go away.’

               ‘And so the two of them lived.’ [F33]
The Action Nominal form of these verbs can be used if there is no
lexical NP referring to objects being counted:
 (499)     a. irkie-l       Saziu-m
              one:VR-ANR_ catch-TR:3SG
              ‘He caught one.’ [F34]

               ‘Three people, two of them were Russians ...’ [F45]
Finally, the Attributive forms of the cardinal verbs can be used
instead of the Attributive forms of the respective numerals. This
usage entails a meaning like ‘X each’, or just some highlighting of
an unusual quantity of some entities, that is, it stresses that some
particular number of entities is associated with a single partici-
pant:
 (500)     a. tagnut      atag-lo-d’e          = karas’-pe-k
               then       [two-VR-ATTR]            crucian.carp-PL-PRED

               ‘an elk with six legs’ [F34] 2.2, Ordinal numerals
The ordinal numerals are derived from the cardinal stems by means
of the suffix -(Ce)s- followed by the Possessive marker, the variant
-§- being attached to the verbal stems:
                                                             Numerals      265(501)   atag-les-ki          ‘the second one’
        jal-mes-ki           ‘the   third one’
        ulek-les-ki          ‘the   fourth one’
        wahan'bo-s-ki        ‘the   fifth one’
        purkijo-s-ki         ‘the   seventh one’The only exception is the ordinal numeral ‘the first’, which is de-
rived by means of the suffix -/’e from the adverb anyume- ‘from
the beginning’ > anyume-l’e ‘the first one’.
   The forms listed in (501) are used as NPs; notably, the Diminu-
tive suffix can be inserted before the Possessive marker:
(502)   a. e, jal-meg-tie-gi           éuge-ge     qodo-l
           DP three-ORD-DIM-POSS road-LOC lie-SF
           ‘Look, the third one is lying on the road.’
        b. tat   tlek-leg-ki           uke-s’
           CA    four-ORD-POSS         come.out-PFV:INTR:38G
           ‘Then the fourth one came out.’ [F16]
The Attributive forms of the ordinal numerals             are built as the
Possessive Attributive forms (see 5.5.1.2), that is, the Possessive
marker -gi is replaced by -de-:
(503)   a. te    = a-te-j                   atag-les-te            and’e
           here make-FUT-TR:1PL             two-ORD-POSS:ATTR      eye
           ‘Now we’ll make the second eye.’ [F31]
        b, irk-in           kun’?     kuni-l’es-te          meme-k
           one-ATTR         ten       ten-ORD-POSS:ATTR     bear-PRED
           nuk-te-me
           find-FUT-OF:18G
           ‘I will find the hundredth bear’ [F4]
The ordinal form can be also derived from the Interrogative gamun
‘how many’ (gam-les-te ‘which (in order)’).
   The meaning of ‘second, third, etc. time’ can be rendered either
by the verbalized form of an ordinal numeral (504a), or, more
rarely, just by means of the Locative case marking (504b).

The cardinal numerals, as well as the Interrogative gam-un ‘how
many’      and        the verb      ninge-     ‘be multiple’,   derive     Frequentative
forms with the meaning ‘X times’ by means of the suffix -(C)id’e:
(505)      gam-Vid’e             ‘how many times’
           ninge-l’rd’e          ‘many times’

The morphology of postpositions is a mixture of the adverbial
Local paradigm (see 4.2.2) and the nominal Possessive Locative
sub-paradigm. The latter kind of forms are available only for some
postpositions, presumably for grammaticalized nouns. They oc-
cur when a postposition is used independently, with an anaphori-
cally dropped argument (see also 8.5.1). Some expected Locative
forms are obsolete or non-existent (this concerns, in particular, the
Prolative and the Directional forms).
    This section contains an exhaustive exemplified list of the Yuk-
aghir postpositions, comprising all attested forms. Postpositions
with purely spatial meanings are discussed in 3.1, those which
have both spatial and temporal meanings, in 3.2. The compara-
tive postposition is described in 3.3.
    Each subsection devoted to a spatial postposition is made up as
a sort of dictionary entry. The heading contains a list of attested
basic (=non-Possessive) forms in the following order: Locative
(Essive) / Ablative / Prolative / Directional. If some form is
absent, it is replaced by x.
   The Possessive forms, if attested, are exemplified in sections in-
troduced by the bullct ». Lexicalized noun+postposition combi-
nations are indicated by the bullet o, directional adverbials derived

Introduction
1. Kolyma Yukaghir       and its genetic affiliation
Kolyma Yukaghir is spoken by about 50 people in the settle-
ments Nelemnoye and Zyryanka, Upper Kolyma district, Yaku-
tia (Sakha) Republic and in Seymchan and Balygychan, Maga-
dan region, Russia. Until very recently, Kolyma Yukaghir has not
been written; the writing system used for the first publication of
Yukaghir folklore (Nikolaeva 1989) and currently employed in the
school in Nelemnoye is based on the Cyrillic alphabet . This gram-
mar describes the variety of Kolyma Yukaghir spoken by the oldest
generation of Yukaghirs in Nelemnoye.
    Kolyma Yukaghir is one of two existing Yukaghir languages
(which used to be referred to as dialects of Yukaghir in the liter-
ature). Another Yukaghir language, Tundra Yukaghir, is spoken
mainly in the settlements Andryushkino     and Kolymskoyc,   Lower
Kolyma district, Yakutia. The Yukaghir languages are convention-
ally considered a genetically isolated group; yet they can probably
be affiliated with the Uralic family (Angere 1956; Bouda 1941;
Collinder 1940, 1960, 1965; Nikolaeva 1988a; 1988b),2. An overview of Kolyma        Yukaghir    grammar
2.4. Phonology and morphophonemics
The vowel system comprises six short vowels,     as represented   in
(1), and their long counterparts.

          /e/, (9              fof
The long vowels /e/, /o/, /#/ can be pronounced as the falling
diphthongs /ie/, /uo/, /u@/.
      The consonant system is represented in Table 1.
      The syllable structure is very simple: with few exceptions, there
exist only syllables of the form                         CV,       CVC (at the beginning of
words, also V, VC). Hence, there are no vowel chisters. Voiced
obstruents are impossible in word-initial and syllable-final posi-
tion; in syllable-final position, voiced obstruents alternate either
with their voiceless counterparts or with sonorants. Voiced and
voiceless consonants                 cannot         co-occur within        a consonant             cluster,
hence syllable-initial voiced obstruents are regularly devaiced at
morphemic boundaries after obstruents.
    Two types of morphophonemic strategies are employed to main-
tain the transparent syllabic structure: first, a number of Yuk-
aghir suffixes show allomorphic variation of the form -Ce- ~ --C-
(below, syllabic vs. consonantal allomorphs).                                     Basically, the allo-
morphs are chosen in such a way as to create a sequence of the
form {...~ Cie — Cy —Cy3e—...} or {...-C,
                                     — Coe — C3 ~ ...},
1.€,, a consonantal morph is selected after a syllabic morph, and
vice versa. Secondly, the epenthetic submorphs -u- and -l- can
be inserted in order to avoid consonant and vowel clustering at
morphemiec boundaries.
                                 An   overmew   of Kolyma   Yukughtr grammer   3    There arc two kinds of harmonic alternations which can be
conventionally termed palatal and labial, yet both affect only a
very restricted number of suffixes, only one of which is produc-
tive. Palatal harmony contrasts the vowels /i/, /e/, /a/, /u/
(with their long counterparts) and the vowels /a/, /o,/ (with their
long counterparts); to some extent, it also determines distribution
of the velar obstruents and their uvular counterparts. Labial har-
mony produces the alternation /e/ ~ /o/ in some suffixes after
roots with /o/ or /o/ in the first syllable.
    Word stress is mobile; to a large extent, it is determined by the
syllable structure: closed syllables and open syllables with long
vowels attract the stress to the end of a word.","[20, 21, 22, 23]"
"2.7. Functions of the Prospective
The Prospective signifies a situation in the future which is viewed
as a consequence of some other situation. This can be either a
prediction based on real-world knowledge (335), or a kind of moral
obligation entailed by the given situation (336). In the passage
given in (337), the Prospective form is first used to predict an
event on the basis of the changing weather; the second instance is
used to express an obligation entailed by the predicted event:

2.8. Functions of the Imperative
The Imperative has the usual range of meaning,                   c.g., command,
request, proposal, admonition, etc.

           right-QLT-INTR:3SG        RECP-take-PL-IMP-3
           ‘That’s right, let them marry.’ {F3]
The second person Imperative with the suffix -ge- (see Table 14)
is used to express commands or requests which have to be fulfilled
later (Krejnovich 1982:149).
(339)   a. tet   colhoro   kuded’e      lek-telle         jagte-ge-k
           lyou hare       liver        —eat-SS:PFV]      sing-IMP-2SG
           ‘Eat some hare liver and then sing!’ [F5]

           {finish-Ss:PFV] come-IMP-2SG DP
           ‘Finish up and then come!’ [F36]
See also 10.2.1, 10.3.1.3 on clause chains with the Imperative finite
clause.
    The Imperative can be negated in the regular way (340c), yet
in the second person Imperative this formation normally involves
the Prohibitive suffix -le- (see Table 14).

Dative form of the Action Nominal is used for the Periphrastic
Prospective. This form has been described by Krejnovich as the
mood of “being ready” (naklonenije gotounosti) (1982:147-149).
    The Auxiliary can be in any form, including the non-finite
forms. If the lexical verb is transitive, the agreement of the Aux-
iliary vacillates: it can follow either the Intransitive paradigm
(which reflects the intransitivity of the verb /’e- ‘be’ itself), or the
Transitive one (in accordance with the transitivity of the lexical
verb) (Krejnovich 1982:148).
2.9.1.2.     Functions.         The Periphrastic Prospective expresses rela-
tive immediate future:
 (341)     a. pon          joule+yot        kude-din       Ve-j

               ‘It was almost evening.’

               ‘That is how I feel when we are not going to see each
               other.’ [F57|
In most cases, the use of this form implies that some preliminary
features of the foregoing event are already present (Krejnovich
1982:148). As a result, this form can be used to refer to a process
in progress, whereby the first stage of the event has already started
(but it is not necessarily the case that it would be brought to its
completion):
 (342)     a. ley-d-ol’-i-t                       am-de-din        Ve-ni

              “When he was approaching the house, he heard a song
              from within.’ [F13|
Finally, this form can be used to express an intention (Krejnovich
1982:148):
(343)      a. éaréagan       d’e tet-ul          lek-tin     Ue-je
              C.             DP     you-ACC      eat-SUP     be-INTR:1SG
              ‘Charchahan, I am going to eat you.’ [F21|
           b. juku i jonza        margil’     min-din      le-mle
              small-goose girl      take-SUP be-OF:3SG
              ‘The small goose is going to marry.’ [F5]
2.9.2. The Periphrastic Past2.9.2.1.    Formation.       The Periphrastic Past is formed by putting
the Subject Nominal form {1.3.5, examples (344)) or the Relative
Nominal form (1.3.7, examples (345)) in the Predicative position.
The former construction is available for intransitive verbs only, the
latter can be used with any verb, cf. (336b) and (336c). According
to the general rules for predicate nominals (see 72.1.1, 12.1.1.3),
this construction requires the copula o- if the subject is first or
second person; if the subject is third person, the nominal can just
take the Predicative case marker.
2.9.2.2. Functions. The Periphrastic Past is used in order to con-
trast. two temporal planes, that is, to highlight that the time of
the situation being described precedes the time of reference; sec
(344a), (345a). This function is by no means grammaticalized in
a way normally implied for the category of tense, rather, its usage
is a matter of optional emphasis on the distinction between tem-
poral planes; see (344a), (345a). For example, (344b) is the final
180      Chapter 6.   Verb morphologysentence of a story about some events which had happened in the
speaker’s childhood, i.c., long before the story was told (see Text
2). The whole story is narrated in the simple non-Future form,
yet in the last sentence the speaker decided to contrastthe time of
the events just described with the time of speech.

             ‘She had treated me badly... That is why I tied her
             with ropes and let ants eat her.’ [F48]
The same construction is used (although very rarely) with a modal
sense:
 (346)    a. tit-in     el-+kej-l-o-d’od-ek
             you-DAT    NEG-give-0-RES-SBNR-PRED

             ‘We have to go in the morning.’ (lit. ‘we are people
             going away in the morning.’)
2.10.    Desiderative
The suffix -ol’- expresses the desiderative meaning (Krejnovich
1982:146). Its productivity is hard to assess: it is practically ab-
sent from texts (where this meaning is expressed either by the
Periphrastic Prospective, or more often, by means of the verb
erd’i- ‘want’ or its derivatives), yet my consultants easily derived
Desiderative forms from various verbs. The suffix scems to belong
to the class of markers which have become obsolete too fast to lose
their productivity. It is particularly common in one, apparently
frozen, combination, leyd-ol’- ‘be hungry’ (leyde- ‘eat’).
(347)     a. qaqa,         éomon    len-d-ol’-d’e

            ‘Friend Tebegej, which way would you prefer to
            die?’ [F28]
182    Chapter   6.   Verb morphology3. Aspect
3.1.   Preluminaries
As a first approximation, the morphological means of aspect mark-
ing can be described by the following scheme, which reflects the
linear order of various aspectual suffixes within a verb form:
(348) [[[ROOT-INTERNAL ASPECT]-RESULTATIVE/INGRESSIVE]-
        IMPERFECTIVE/ HABITUAL]
The basic opposition between Perfective and Imperfective com-
prises two morphological “layers”: the Internal Aspect marking,
on the one hand, and the regular Imperfective (3.2) and Habitual
(3.4) marking, on the other.            The Internal Aspect (see 3.3) com-
prises the Perfective suffix -j- (3.3.1) and a set of non-productive
imperfective suffixes. As in many other languages, the Internal
Imperfective is more closely related to the lexical meaning of a
verb and frequently involves various sorts of quantification of situ-
ation which can be subsumed under the term Iterative (a series of
identical subevents within one time interval, on one occasion).*?
That is why these suffixes are referred to below as “Iterative suf-
fixes” (3.3.2). The Internal Perfective is compatible with the reg-
ular Imperfective suffix, the output also being the itcrative sense
(3.2.4).
    Note that the Perfective vs. Imperfective opposition (with the
Iterative as a distinguished subtype of the Imperfective) is also
maintained within the system of the Same-Subject converbs (see
1.4.3, 1.4.4, 1.4.5} which thus constitute the most. “external” layer
of aspect marking, directly associated with temporal relations be-
tween different situations.","[195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202]"
"1.1.2.    Distribution of the Finite forms
The finite forms are used in one-clause (simple) sentences and
in main clauses within multiclausal sentences. The finite forms
are distributed over two interdependent functional parameters, the
illocutionary sentence type and the grammatical Focus.      On the
142      Chapter 6.   Verb morphology
one hand, neither the Imperative nor the Interrogative forms can
enter the grammatical Focus construction. On the other hand,
with respect to the Focus semantics (see 12.3), the Imperative
forms are similar to the Main forms, inasmuch as both can serve
as the single element within the scope of the illocutive operator
(narrow focus}. This property is manifested by the capability of
being the only overt element of a main clause:
 (273)     a. tabun       qon-te-l-ben-pe                kel-delle

              RECP-take-PL-IMP-2
               ‘Let them marry!’ (lit. ‘take each other’) [K1]
This is impossible for the Focus-indicating and Interrogative
forms. The SF forms and the OF forms are used only in the
nominal Focus constructions (Krejnovich 1982:204-216), that. is,
they constitute a finite clause only in combination with a noun
phrase in the Predicative form.”

In particular,    the Focus      construction         (hence,   the SF     or the OF
form) is the only option in questions with an Interrogative pronoun
in the intransitive subject function or in the direct object function
(Krejnovich 1982:232-234), i.c., whenever a constituent                         able to
trigger the grammatical Focus marking is questioned.

           what-PRED          bring-OF:28G
           ‘What have you brought?’ [F33]
Similarly, the Interrogative forms are used only in the context of a
non-Focus question word (277). General (yes/no) questions allow
only the Indicative forms (278a); the Indicative form is also an
option in specific questions           (278b).   Thus, an Interrogative form
(exactly like a Focus-indicating form) cannot constitute the narrow
focus of an interrogative clause.

including the result of a situation, the affected participant of a

               ‘Outside, near the house, there was nothing but the

The Result. Nominal can be used to refer fo the location where
the situation has taken place (see also 11.4.2, 13.5.3.1 on the use
of the Result Nominal for Spatial adverbial clauses}. This use
is apparently motivated by the fact that the location is likely to
preserve some traces of the situation.

The Result Nominal form is typically used for titles of mytholog-
ical stories on particular issues of the world creation (in order to
indicate that the events described in the story have entailed some

The Result, Nominal can be used to express situations and facts.
In these functions, the Result Nominal serves as the relative-past
counterpart of the Action Nominal; see 7/.1 for the use of the
Result Nominal in various types of complement clauses, /7/.4.1.1
for its use in the Anterior          adverbial clause,         17.3.2 for its use in
relative clauses.   It. can also be used as a (nominal) predicate, see
12,1.1.4.","[172, 173, 174, 175]"
"3. Semantics of grammatical         Focus
Focus marking in Yukaghir is strongly constrained in terms of the
participant roles it is compatible with: it can be applied only to
one participant per clause type, the 5 participant of an intransitive
clause and the O participant of a transitive clause (see 2.2).           In
other words, the widely known “focus prominence” of Yukaghir
has to be understood, in the case of Kolyma Yukaghir, in a rather
458     Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focusspecific fashion:      it is not a language which marks which element
of a (finite) clause represents the Focus of this clause. Rather, it
is a language which marks each finite clause for whether or not its
S/O participant is the Focus.
      If the S/O constituent represents the only element within the
scope of assertion (narrow focus) or its contrastive part, Focus
marking is compulsory (3.1). Conversely, if this constituent is
excluded from the scope of assertion, only the neutral packaging
option is available. Between these poles, the Focus marking is
applied to delimit the assertion rendered by the given clause from
the preceding material.           More specifically, it identifies the S/O
constituent as the first constituent within the scope of assertion
(3.2). Thus, generally, the grammatical opposition between the
neutral and Focus packaging options is used not to mark the status
of a single constituent, but rather serves a more global information-
structuring function.
    It should be stressed that this marking operates independently
of the discourse-determined statuses of the NPs involved, like new-
ness, accessibility, etc. The most compelling evidence of this inde-
pendence is given by the Focus marking of pronominal (i.e., highly
accessible) NPs (3.2.4), on the one hand, and the regular absence
of this marking in text-initial existential clauses, where the S par-
ticipant obviously represents a new entity (3.2.5).","[477, 478]"
"1.1.1. Clauses with nominal predicates in the Predicative form
The nominal predicate in the Predicative case occurs only with the
third-person subject (761); otherwise, the copular pattern must be
used (see 1.1.2):
(761)   a. éomolben    lebie-n-+end’od-ek

               this girl       my younger.sibling
               ‘This girl is my younger sister.’
The subject of a descriptive clause can be easily omitted, so that
a clause is made up of a single NP in the Predicative case:
 (762)     a. irk-in              Soromo         ejre-j                     joba

               families of Evens.’ |F55]
1.1.2. Copular descriptive clauses
The copular pattern is the only option if the subject of a descrip-
tive clause is first or second person:
                                          Clauses with nominal predicates   439(763)   a. met     vasilej-die o-d’e

           ‘You are a terrible disease!’ [F47]
The bound copula form -/ 76- can also be used in this construction,
although such examples are less common; see (764). Somewhat
unexpectedly, the bound variant, in contrast to the free variant,
allows Plural and Possessive marking on the noun:*®
(764)   a. mit     kereke-pul+no-dili
           we      Koryak-PL+COP-INTR:1PL
           ‘We are the Koryaks (you are looking for).’ [F50|

           ‘You turned out to be a bad son-in-law.’ [F18]
With the third-person subject, the copular pattern is used if some
modal meaning has to be expressed (765), in non-finite descriptive
clauses (766) and in negative clauses (767a):
440      Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focus (765) a. tamun             meme        abut               o-l’el

The negative prefix is attached to the free copula (767a)-{767b)
or to the noun followed by the bound copula (767c) (Krejnovich
1982:193-194)):
 (767)     a. éomparna           el+o

                                                  Clauses with nominal predicates   441         c. met   el+tebegej+no-d’e
           I      NEG+T.+COP-INTR:1SG
            ‘Tam not Tebegej.’ [F28]
The subject of a copular clause can be omitted if its referent, is
recoverable; see (767a)-(767b) and (768).
 (768)   a. grd’-o-l                 lebie-ge           —ejre-t

           ‘They were such lazy people.’ [F53]
The copula o- has the transitive counterpart o-Z-, which has a
slot for Nominative NP that qualifies the O participant from the
point of view of the A participant:
 (769)     mit 1d’ tit-ul                     Soromo
           we now you(PL)-ACC                 person

           ‘From now on we will not consider you human beings
           (you will not be human beings to us).’ {K4]
1.1.3. Headless relative clauses as nominal predicates
Headless relative clauses (see 17.3.3} can be used as nominal pred-
icates, both with the copula o- (770) and in the Predicative form
(771)-(772). In this construction, the subject of a descriptive
clause is identified with (or described as) the relativized partic-
ipant.
    If the relativized participant is the subject, the subject of the
matrix clause is identified with the subject of the relative clause.
Thus, the whole construction has a single subject NP which is de-
442      Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focusscribed as the primary participant of the relative clause situation.
The resulting structure is similar to that of a simple clause, the
only difference being the “complex” form of the verb; see (770)-
(771).     As described in 6.2.9.2.2, such constructions function as
the Periphrastic Past. Note that in such a construction the neg-
ative marker is attached to the lexical verb, not to the copula
(771b)-(771c).

               flood    before we-ABL go-PFV:SBNR-PL-PRED
               “They had gone away from me before the flood.’
If the relativized participant is the direct object, the subject of the
matrix clause is identified with the O participant of the relative
clause situation. Thus, the O participant is represented by the
subject NP (this constituent is shown in boldface in (772)). This
structure clearly distinguishes such constructions from their simple
                                                       Clauses   with nominal predicates   443transitive counterparts:

            make-3PL:ATTR-RELNR-PRED|
            ‘This is a thing the rich did in order to deceive
            people.’
However, the substantivized Passive Attributive forms (such as
those in (772)) can be also involved in the Periphrastic past forms,
which entails reanalysis of the construction as a simple clause,
hence, the Accusative marking of the O constituent (see examples
in 6.2.9.2.2).891.1.4. Result Nominal clauses as nominal predicates
The Result Nominal clause (6.1.3.4) can function as a nominal
predicate of a descriptive clause. This construction describes some
observed state of affairs as a result of a prior situation. The subject
of such a descriptive clause is either represented by the pronoun
tabun or dropped.

This construction can be employed to signify that the primary
participant of the Result Nominal situation is a part of the asser-
tion; see, e.g., (773c)-(773d).% This use is motivated by the fact
that the A participant constitutes an element of the preceding sit-
uation, but not of the resulting state. For example, the sentence
in (773d) is intended to explain why the speaker is in some place
(the resulting state of affairs which does not involve the cause),
and this explanation invokes a preceding transitive situation with
its A participant.","[457, 458, 459, 460, 461, 462, 463, 464]"
"Generally, the verb forms do not mark the case role of the rel-

"3.7.     Other aspect-related markers
3.7.1. The Purposive
The Purposive suffix -72- ~ -d’e7- signifies movement with the pur-
pose to perform the action specified by the verb stem (Krejnovich
1982:152):
 (397)     a. tat   ugujel-me        egie-delle         tude
              [CA   morning-ADV      stand.up-ss:PFV]   his

              ‘T will go in order to look for the track of the elk.’
The Purposive suffix -j2- has the form -d’ej- after consonants, cf.
mon-d’ej- ‘go in order to say’ (Krejnovich 1982:152); the suffix
induces the /j/ ~ /é/ alternation in the following morph, e.g.,
jagte-ji-s’ ‘{he} went in order to sing’.
    The suffix is productive, that is, it can be applied whenever
the verb signifies an action which can be carried out intentionally
(of course, except for the verbs of motion), yet it is being rapidly
replaced by constructions with a verb of motion plus the Supine
(supported by the similar Russian pattern), see 17.4.4.",[229]
"3.1.1. Question words
If the 8/O constituent is represented by an interrogative pronoun
or contains a question word, it has to be marked as the Focus
(796).
 (796)   a. kin-tek       tin = mino-le        ejre-t-u-L?
            who-PRED      this   raft-INSTR   walk-FPUT-0-SF

            ‘What are you afraid of on the earth?’ [F31|

            ‘Who has cooked the food standing there?’ [F26]

            ‘What, (kind of) fox do you need, do you need a silver
            fox?’ [F38|
This case is fully grammaticalized: the Focus marking is manda-
tory whenever a question word occurs in the S/O position, ie.,
not only in question-word questions, but also in dependent clauses
made up as questions (where the interrogative pronoun functions
as a sort of relative pronoun,     see 19.5.3), and in exclamatory sen-
tences with question words (see        3.3.1.1).
460      Chapter 12.   Nominal predicates   and grammatical   Focus3.1.2.    Narrow focus
If the answer to a question-word question like (796) is constructed
as implied by the question, that is, if it answers exactly that ques-
tion, without any reformulation of its presuppositions, the con-
stituent that “replaces” the question word is also marked as Focus.
The sentence in (797a) is the answer to the question in (793b) and
(797b) is the answer to (796b):
 (797)     a. met-ek — gon-te-l

               ‘(What are you afraid of? ...) Iam afraid of the food
               which is called sour-cream, of fat meat, of hare-fur
               blankets.’ [F31]
This environment can be subsumed under a broader category of
“narrow focus” clauses, i.e., clauses in which the S/O constituent or
one of its subconstituents is the only element of the assertion, the
remainder of the clause being presupposed and/or implied. This
environment obligatorily triggers the Focus packaging variant:

Note that the notion of contrastive Focus, as employed here, is not
equal to the notion of the focus of contrast, as defined by Chafe
(1976). More specifically, the contrastive Focus environment does
not imply that the remainder of the clause is presupposed, i.e.,
the contrastive Focus is not taken to be a kind of narrow focus
(as in 3.1.2), The only additional condition is that the contrasting
                                         Semantics of grammatical Focus   463element is a part of the assertion (which is intended to rule out so
called “contrastive topics”).
      Thus,   the Focus packaging variant is compulsory          if the $/O
constituent (or its sub-constituent) represents the narrow focus
or the contrastive part of the assertion. Either condition is sufh-
cient for the Focus marking to be compulsory. Of course, the rare
clear instances of the focus of contrast, (where these conditions are
combined) also involve the Focus marking:

              {NEG I-PRED} CA be-sF | {raven-PRED} CA be-SF
              ‘It is not me that is doing this, it is a reven that is
              doing this.’
3.2. Free Focus marking
3.2.1. Functions of Focus marking
If the scope of assertion comprises both the finite verb and the
S/O constituent (“broad focus”), and there is no explicit contrast,
Focus marking is not mandatory, i.e., the broad scope of assertion
generally allows both packaging options. In this situation, Focus
marking (in contrast to neutral clause structure) has a twofold
semantic impact: it signifies that the S/O constituent is a part
of the assertion and delimits the assertion rendered by the given
clause from the previously introduced information, i.e., the Focus
is always the first constituent of the sentence which is within the
scope of assertion.
    The role played by each of these factors is slightly different for
intransitive (SF marking)       and transitive (OF marking) clauses.
For intransitive clauses, the semantic difference between the neu-
tral and Focus packaging variants is appropriately approximated
as the opposition between clauses with the S participant outside
vs.    within the scope of assertion, i.e., Focus marking is normally
required to impose the so-called thetic, or broad-focus informa-~
tion structure (3.2.2).      For transitive clauses, this factor is less
significant, since the O participant is not the “default” topic of the
transitive clause {as it is the case for the S participant). Accord-
464      Chapter 12. Nominal predicates and grammatical Focusingly, the delineating function plays the major role in the choice
of a packaging option, i.e., Focus marking is applied to signal a
salient information-structuring boundary immediately before the
O constituent (3.2.3).
    There are two environments which suggest. that this distinction
is a matter of a tendency of usage, rather than of a strict func-
tional opposition between SF marking and OF marking. First, a
pronominal O constituent must be marked for the grammatical
Focus to be included into the scope of assertion. In this case, the
type of NP implies the “default” topical status and thus overrides
the difference between the S participant and the O participant
(3.2.4).      Secondly, the SF marking is not applied if the S con-
stituent is exactly the first element of a text, i.e., when there is
simply nothing to be delimited from. This observation appears to
indicate that the delineating effect is involved in the SF semantics
as well. This is most clearly illustrated by the structural difference
between text-initial and text-internal existential sentences (3.2.5).
   Thus, the general semantic impact of Focus marking is to
present the S/O constituent as the first element of the assertion.
Note that the compulsory Focus marking environments can also
be subsumed under this general formulation.","[479, 480, 481, 482, 483, 484]"
"2.1.2.   Situations
The major means of referring to a previously described situation
within a clause describing another situation are nominal demon-
strative pronouns (7.1.2.2.3); the pronoun tabun ~ tamun ‘that’
can replace Nominal clauses in the complement function (909a)
and in the adverbial function (909b):

The Locative form of this demonstrative has a function which can-
not be derived from the meanings of the constituent morphemes:
it is regularly used in order to indicate that the situation described

The situation just described can also be resumed in the next clause
by the combination of the connective adverb tat (see 7.1.2.2.4) and
the verb 1’e- ‘be’ (911a)-(911b) or, less frequently, @- ‘make’ (911c)
or kude- ‘become’ (912).!0?

the initial clause in a clause chain and establish a link between
the preceding finite clause and the rest, of the chain. The switch-
reference markers thus indicate whether the subject of the pre-
ceding finite clause is similar to or different from that of the next
clause:

See also Section 3 on the connective function of the form tat. Note
that these means of referring to a previously described situation
are generally not applied if the main predicate of the given sentence
is the same as in a preceding clause (for this case, see 2.2).","[545, 546, 547, 548]"
"  2. Clause chaining involves some degree of backgrounding of the
        non-finite clauses, or, the other way round, the finite clause
        is accorded the primary prominence; see 2.3.
  3. Clause        chaining    implies     thematic    unity    between      clauses,
        which may entail various degrees of semantic cohesion (2.4).
These properties are characteristic of all instances of ordinary
chaining and determine the functional distinction between the
chaining and the mere sequencing of finite clauses. However,
within this functional domain, the semantic impact of chaining
varies from presenting a sequence of events as a coherent stretch
of discourse to signaling rather tight semantic relations between
propositions. The former pole is instantiated by chains describing
a coherent series of subsequent events.

The order of clauses in such a chain is iconic, i.e. it reflects the tem-
poral order of events; thus, the temporal interpretation of clause
chains does not differ from the “default” interpretation of sequences
of finite clauses. The deranking is also uniquely determined by the
temporal order (the finite clause always describes the last event),
hence, the backgrounding effect is not signiftcant. Finally, the se-
mantic cohesion amounts to the temporal adjacency of events and
some sort of discourse coherence (or thematic unity). In sum, the
chaining is employed simply as a discourse structuring device and
involves a minimum of semantic implications.
   The following sections demonstrate that each of the properties
outlined above can have a more significant impact on the interpre-
tation of a clause chain. This semantic variation correlates with
the degree of structural cohesion: the “loose” chains as in (692) ex-
hibit the linear structure, while a higher degree of backgrounding
or semantic cohesion may involve the nesting or merged structure
(1.3). Besides, the degree of semantic cohesion may determine the
choice of the Perfective vs. Imperfective SS form in a consecutive
chain (see 2.4.1). However, no strict grammatical distinctions can
be drawn between various semantic subtypes of ordinary chains.","[401, 402]"

3.2.     Optative
There is a special construction which signifies that the situation
is strongly desired, yet the speaker cannot bring it about; in par-
ticular, the fulfillment of this wish may depend on some other
person(s) (855b) or be simply impossible (855d).                    This construc-
tion is built as the combination of the optative particle gonoho and
the Result Nominal form (6.1.3.4) of the verb. The construction
is subjectless; the implied primary participant of the situation is
the speaker.

See 4.1.3 on adverbial negation.
   Note that if the standard negative prefix occurs with a noun in
the Nominative form (which happens very rarely outside of some
                                                                        Negation   493specific verb patterns; see 12.1.3.2), it can have only the privative
meaning (‘without’), that is, the negated Nominative form is used
instead of the Privative form; see (5.5.2):

4.1.2. Focus and negation
Constituent negation (by means of the standard negative marker)
is possible only with the Focus constituent (860a). The scope of
standard negation on the verb in the Focus construction is confined
to the Focus constituent (860b)-(860c). Both types of examples
are extremely infrequent.

               to sing again, dreaming.’ [K4]
This construction is in clear semantic contrast to negative marking
on the verb (cf. (861c) and (862a)) and to double negation, both
on the adverb and on the verb (cf. (861a) and (862b)).

               ‘Around them, there were no people nearby.’ [F22]
The negative marker is also attested with some adverbial pro-
forms, but in these examples               it entails negative marking on the
verb:
 (863)     a. tanide            eli qodo      _—_el-t gon-moZi-je

"1.1.3. Polarity1.1.3.1. Negative forms.                 The Negative Main forms are identical
for transitive and intransitive verbs              (Jochelson 1905; Krejnovich

the Intransitive Main paradigm, the third person marker is zero
(for intransitive verbs, the regular 3sG marker -7 is possible as
well), see Table 15.

only exception is the Irrealis form, which is most often used in
combination with the Affirmative marker; sce 2.4. Otherwise, the
Affirmative marker can be used in order to emphasize the assertion
expressed by the finite verb.

derived by adding the suffix -j/e}, the Passive Attributive form,
by the same suffixes that are used for the OF forms (see Table
13). The Passive Attributive markers normally cross-reference the
subject of the relative clause.       However,    the form in -me              can be
used as a generic (“impersonal”) Passive Attributive form.                      Both
types of Attributive forms can contain the regular Future marker
(280), although such examples are rather infrequent (see 2.3 on
the functions of the Future).

The Passive Attributive forms are morphologically distinguished
from the OF forms in that they cannot get the modal markers
{that is, they cannot be marked for the Inferential, Prospective
and Irrealis meanings), while the OF forms have the full range of
finite morphology.

"6.    Nominal         derivation
 6.1. Derivational suffices
6.1.1. The Diminutive
The Diminutive is derived by means of the suffix -die- (/d/ alter-
nates with /t/ after obstruents, as described in 3.3.2.1); the final
/t/, /V/ of a stem are dropped before the Diminutive marker (cf.
1.4); the final {£} of a stem alternates with /te/, /a/ according
to the rules described in 8.3.4.3.2):
(249)      SojVbul       =>     sajVbu-die          ‘little mouse’
           Sal           >      sa-die              ‘little tree, stick’
           Sagale        =>     §aqala-die          ‘little fox’
           terike        >      terikre-die         ‘(little) old woman’
                                                           Nominal   derivation      129A noteworthy          distributional feature of the Diminutive is that it
follows the Plural marker when combined                within one word form:(250)     pulut-pe-die      ‘(little) old men’
          terike-p-tie      ‘(little) old women’
          ugrpe-p-tie       ‘(little) children’
In many     cases, the Diminutive         seems    to have rather affectionate
meaning. in order to stress the meaning ‘little’, the Diminutive
form can be combined with the Attributive form of the verb juko-
‘be little’.
 (251)       juko-d’e         gorobo-die-lek        tadi-yile
             small-ATTR       cow-DIM-PRED          give-3PL:OF
             ‘They gave him a tiny cow.’ [F27]
Another way to stress a very small quantity or size is to apply the
Diminutive suffix to a nominal form of this verb.
 (252)       éul-e            guko-d’on-ben-die-lek                  pan-mele
             meat-INSTR       small-SBNR-RNR-DIM-PRED                cook-OF:3SG
             ‘She cooked a very small piece of meat.’ [F51]
In a few cases, the Diminutive entails singulative meaning:
(253)    ul’egera-die       ‘straw’
         straws-DIM
         cul-die            ‘a little piece of meat’
         meat-DIMWhen applied to the negative form of the indefinite pronoun leme,
n’e-leme ‘nothing’, the Diminutive suffix has an emphatic impact
(like ‘not even a bit’).
(254)       n'e-leme-die              el-+-lejda-je        Soromo-pul         tite

            here and there (without any success).’
130     Chapter 5. Nominal morphology
Finally, the Diminutive suffix is often used in combination with
recent borrowings from Russian, having no function but to make
a word more Yukaghir-like,              e.g., Juka-die ‘pike’ (from Russian
shchuka ‘pike’), ajka-die ‘sea gull’ (from Russian chajka ‘sea
gull’). In particular, this device is commonly applied to Russian
first names, e.g., Aleks’ej-die, Egor-die, Miqajla-die (in each word,
the first component is just a Russian male name).","[148, 149, 150]"
"1.2.     Word order in the noun phrase
Noun phrases are head-final (see Sections 2-3); the order of noun
modifiers conforms, with few exceptions, to the following scheme:
(547) DEMONSTRATIVE + QUANTIFIER + POSSESSIVE PRONOUN
         + ATTRIBUTE + HEAD
where “attribute” stands for any lexical modifier, be it an NP ora
relative clause. This scheme is illustrated by the following exam-
ples:

                ‘my friend (a girl)’
Attributive Indefinite pronouns combine only with attributes; they
are always phrase-initial:
 (554}     a. ile         gonme-n’-d’e             Soromo-pul
              some       [mind-PRPR-ATTR]          person-PL

                ‘some animals who ate each other.’
In contradiction to the general scheme in (547), contrastive at-
tributes may precede determiners and possessive pronouns.       Such
cases are attested with attributes which single out one of several
people who have the same kinship relationship to somebody:
 (555)     a. @rd’o-l               tude   masl’ug
                [middle-ANR]       her     daughter

           b. Gomo-i        = tan’ = paba-gi
                {big-ANR]       that elder.sister-POss
                ‘the oldest of those elder sisters of hers.’
Since the NP may contain more than one noun, its internal struc-
ture may turn out ambiguous, as shown in (556):°°
(556) MODIFIER <MODIFIER HEAD>yeap
          <MODIFIER HEAD>yopirrer HEAD
                                      Noun phrases as noun modifiers   289These options are illustrated in (557). Note that the NP-initial
demonstrative modifier is related to the NP as a whole in (557a),
but to the nominal modifier in (557b).
(557)   a. tin      Cugl’e-d+omnr                nied tl
           that <<ancient-ATTR+people>           tell-ANR>

           <that <be.rich-ATTR old.man>>            house
           ‘the house of that rich old man’
This structural ambiguity can be resolved by means of Possessive
marking (2.2.4) or Attributive marking (2.3.1).","[306, 307, 308, 309]"
" 1.2. The village of Nelemnoye
Nelemnoye is located in the Upper Kolyma district, Yakutia
(Sakha) Republic, approximately 70 km from the district center
Zyryanka. It was established in 1931, when the nomadic Yukaghirs
living in the basins of Yasachnaya and Korkodon Rivers were or-
ganized into the collective farm “Bright life” ({kolkhoz “Svetlaya
zhiznj”). The original name of the village was nungeden anil’ ‘the
Rassokha mouth’ (the Rassokha is a tributary of the Yasachnaya).
Later the village was renamed Nelemnoye, a Russian-based to-
ponym, presumably motivated by the etymology of the Yukaghir
nungeden. nunge is a sort of fish, like trout, which is called nel’ma
in Russian. In 1956-58 the village was moved to a new place, about
75 km down the Yasachnaya River, since the old place near the
mouth of the Rassokha River turned out to be too low (Vakhtin
1992:48),
     Communication between Nelemnoye and Zyryanka is by car in
winter and by motorboat in summer; there is also sporadic com-
munication by helicopter. According to the settlement household
book, the population of Nelemnoye was 245 in 1987, including 133
Yukaghirs (Vakhtin 1992:48). There is a school, a kindergarten, a
shop, a post office, and a club in the village. The main economic
activity is fur trade. Most of the men are hunters and fishermen,
as they have been for ages. The women are employed within the
village; they work in the school, in the kindergarten, in the local
shop, ete.
     The ethnic groups of Nelemnoye are Yukaghirs (~ 54%), Yakuts
(~ 22%), Russians (~ 19%), and Evens (~ 4%);° the languages
spoken, in order of prevalence, are Russian, Yakut, Yukaghir, and
Even. Of the 133 Yukaghirs, only nine named Yukaghir as their
first language; for about 50 it is the mother tongue, i.e., it was
acquired in childhood from parents (Vakhtin 1992:53, his Table
6). The oldest segment of the population is multilingual, so that
Yukaghir is spoken by some Evens and Yakuts as well.
                                  Sociolinguistic situation in Nelemnoye   211.8. Some remarks on Yukaghir history
Apparently, the vast territories from the Lena river across mod-
ern Yakutia to the eastern coast of Chukotka were populated by
the Yukaghirs in the 17"" century.       After the Evenki (Tungus),
Yakuts, and Evens penetrated the territory, the Yukaghirs were
slowly squeezed out. The Russian colonization (since the middle of
the 17"" century} has largely destroyed the traditional subsistence
system of the Yukaghirs, resulting in a sharp decline of the Yuk-
aghir population (Tugolukov 1979). The first scholar of Kolyma
Yukaghir, Woldemar Jochelson predicted as early as in 1900 that
the language could disappear and the tribe would cease to exist
within a few decades (Jochelson 1900:xv).
   Until recently, multilingualism was widespread, and Yukaghir,
Even, Chukchi and Yakut served alternatively as languages of in-
tercultural communication in different cultural situations (Maslova
and Vakhtin 1996:999}. This situation is still preserved in the
oldest generation of Yukaghirs (above 60): they gencrally speak
Yukaghir, Russian and Yakut, and often also Even, choosing an
appropriate language depending on the particular situation, ad-
dressee’s ethnic affiliation, etc. Russian gained the leading posi-
tion in Nelemnoye after World War II, and at the same time the
process of Yukaghir language loss became most active. Nowadays,
Russian is the only language spoken by all inhabitants of the vil-
lage.","[40, 41]"
"5. Kolyma     and Tundra      Yukaghir
The Kolyma aud Tundra Yukaghir languages used to be described
as dialects. which seems to be misleading in view of the significant
28   Chapter 2. Kolyma   Yukaghir and its speakersdistinctions in lexicon, grammar, and phonology. Presumably due
to the extensive language contacts, the lexical distinctions cven
within the basic vocabulary are so great that glottochronological
counts give ca. 2000 years of divergence (Nikolaeva and Helimsky
1997:155-156). The grammatical divergent features seem to have
been underestimated in previous studies of Yukaghir, probably
because neither of the grammars was known well enough. That
is why both existing monographs on Yukaghir (Krejnovich 1938;
1982) treat the two languages together, although some divergent
features are mentioned. The present grammar deviates from this
tradition and treats Kolyma Yukaghir as a distinct language to be
described in its own right.
Chapter 3
Phonology
This chapter introduces basic phonological and phonetic infor-
mation needed to understand the transcription used through-
out     the book.      Since      neither     acoustic   nor articulatory   investiga-
tion of Kolyma Yukaghir phonetics has been undertaken so far,
the description presented in Sections 1-2 is based on auditory
data and distributional analysis only; to a large extent, it should
be viewed as an exemplified summary of the previous descrip-
tions (Krejnovich 1982:9-28; Nikolaeva 1988b), although there are
some minor differences in interpretation of data. Section 3 gives
an overview of phonological and morphonological alternations.
The word stress (Section 4) is described according to (Nikolaeva
1988b).","[47, 48, 49]"
"5.1. Possessive pronouns us. Possessive markers
Formally, the pronominal arguments of postpositions are encoded
in the same way as pronominal possessive modifiers of nouns, ei-
ther by the possessive forms of personal pronouns (7.1.1.2) or by
the Possessive marking (5.2, 2.2) on the postposition itself. Yet, in
NPs, the possessive forms of third person pronouns are reflexive,
that is, they signify that the Possessor is coreferential with the
subject of the clause. In postpositional phrases, this is not the
case, i.e., the possessive forms may (599), but need not (600) be
coreferential with the subject:

               ‘This woman’s dog jumped around her showing
               affection.’
To some extent, the non-reflexive use of these forms is determined
by the fact that not all postpositions have the Possessive mor-
phology, i.¢e., the non-reflexive counterpart of possessive pronouns
is not always available (see 7.3 for the list of postpositions which
have Possessive forms). Quite predictably, since one member of
the opposition is not available, the opposition is neutralized.
   It should be noted, however, that the possessive pronouns may
be used non-refiexively with those postpositions which do take the
                                                 Postposttional phrases   321Possessive markers; see (600c) and (601):

             ‘The bag lay near him.’ [F49]
In other words, the functional opposition between reflexive (free)
and non-reflexive (bound) pronominal modifiers is neutralized for
arguments of all postpositions, independently of the morphological
availability of the latter option in each particular case. It may be
assumed, therefore, that the noun-to-postposition grammatical-
ization in Yukaghir involves two partially independent processes:
   e Reinterpretation of the possessive modifier as the argument
        of a postposition. The possessive form of pronominal modi-
        fiers is preserved, but it is reinterpreted as a non-Possessive
        instance of the personal pronoun, hence the loss of the reflex-
        ive meaning (which is associated only with the possessive use
        of personal pronouns, see 7.1.1).
   e Loss of the nominal morphology, in particular, of the Posses-
        sive morphology.","[339, 340, 341]"
" 1.2.    Verbal paradigm
The verb paradigm falls into several sub-paradigms:                     finite forms,
Attributive forms, Nominal forms, and Converbs (non-finite
switch-reference forms). The finite non-imperative inflection com-
prises polarity markers, tense/mood markers, and agreement
markers, ordered as shown by the following scheme:(103) Finite non-imperative inflection:

"1.1.4.    The Intensified form
The Intensified form is built by attaching the postpositional mor-
pheme zd’e to the pronominal stem. The form is used instead of
the Nominative case form in order to emphasize the identity of
the participant, cither in contrast to other possible candidates for
this role (439a}, or to stress that the action is carried out by this
participant alone (439b); in (439c), both factors are present.

           ‘She has secretly eaten the meat (=elk) that I have
           killed on her own.’ [F48]
Nowadays, the Intensified form of personal pronouns is often cre-
ated by means of the Russian loanword sam ‘self’. The resulting
form of the third person singular is either tude+sam (440c) or
tut-sam ‘he himself’ (440d).

1.2.    Demonstrative pronouns
1.2.1. Demonstrative             pro-forms       and their Interrogative counter-
         parts
There are three demonstrative stems (Krejnovich 1982:155; 237):(441)     #-         proximate demonstratives (‘this, the nearest’)
          ada-       separated demonstrative (‘this, that there’)
          ta _ distal (invisible) demonstrative (‘that; such’)
and the interrogative stem              go-      ~   ga- (‘which?’).    The       demon-
strative and interrogative stems show some (although not abso-
lute) parallelism in derivation of their attributive, nominal, spatial,
qualitative, and temporal forms. These forms are given in Table
19. This subsection describes only the morphology and syntactic
functions of various forms. For functional distinctions between the
demonstrative series, see 1.2.2. The Interrogatives are described
in 1.3. See also 1.2.2.1-1.2.2.2 for complex forms associated with
                                                                                 Pronouns   239particular discourse functions (examples (458), (462)).
1.2.1.1. The Attributive demonstratives are normally used as de-
terminers:
 (442)   a. kin-tek                tig      mino-le         ejre-t-u-l?
            who-PRED               this    raft-INSTR       walk-FUT-0-SF
            ‘Who will sail on this raft?’ [F9]
         b. tet-in           pas‘ibe         edin     jodolben     jolo-hude
            you-DAT          thank          [this     package         back-DIR
            kest-l-ol
            bring-0-RNR|
            “Thank you for having brought this package
            back.’ [F32]
         c. tudel     jobs                modo-l’el             tay     pulut

            ‘He lived in the forest, that old man.’ [F3]
In some cases, although very rarely, they are used as NPs, instead
of the respective nominal forms (pronouns):

            that-ABL          he            this-ACcC       all

            ‘From that one, he learned all these things well.’ [F31]
         b. tay-gele           n’elbet-telle           n’e-leme-de-jle
            [that-Acc          skin-ss:PFV]            [NEG-what-POSss-Acc

            NEG-take-PRV]                 house-AD-DIR          go-PFV-INFR(3SG)
            ‘Having skinned that one, without taking any part of
            it, he went home.’ [F34]
The demonstrative            tay         in the Plural form is used to express as-
sociative plural meaning (‘X and those associated with X’). This
construction is most common with kinship terms (444a)-(444b)
and proper names (444c).

               ‘After they had gone far away, Christ and his people
               left.’ [F9]
1.2.1.2.     The      nominal    demonstratives           (demonstrative    pronouns)
are used as noun phrases, referring to both inanimate (445) and
animate (446) entities.
 (445)     a. tet      gon        num-mek            tugn?

              that    name-Poss T.
              ‘That one, his name was Tebegej.’ [F28]
The Nominal demonstratives are inflected for Number and Case
in the standard way (see 5.1). For specific syntactic and discourse
uses of the Nominal demonstratives, see 1.2.2.
                                                               Pronouns   2411.2.1.3. The interrogative Nominal gadon is used only in the Local
case forms or in combination with postpositions.             Thus, it serves
as an alternative for the Locative (adverbial) Interrogatives:
 (447)   a. pulun-die,      — qo-t        kel-u-k?
            old.man-DIM       where-ABL   come-0-ITR:2SG

            “Where have you come from?’1.2.1.4. The adverbial Locative paradigm (Locative — Ablative —
Prolative — Directional; see 4.2.2) is fully preserved only for the
Separated Demonstrative         (448); otherwise,     one form is used for
both Locative (Essive) and Prolative meanings (449).

qualitative verbs (see 4.3.2 for the properties of qualitative verbs,
6.3.6.4.2 for other qualitative verbs derived by means of the same
242      Chapter 7.   Morphology    of ctosed classessuffix). The examples in (450) illustrate the verb-like morpholog-
ical and syntactic behavior of these forms.

However,       there is one important                   exception:           as noun modifiers,
these forms occur both in the verbal Attributive form (451) and
in the unmarked form (452). In this sense, they can be taken to
belong to the small group of putative adjectives described in 4.3.4.

distinguished in terms of the distance from the point of reference
(in particular, visibility (Krejnovich 1982:235-237)) and in terms
of the control and direct availability for the speaker.
      The series in é- refers to most proximate entities and/or lo-
cations which are directly available to the speaker (for example,
something belonging to the speaker):
 (455)     a. te-gide    ejre-s’
              here-DIR_ walk-PFV:INTR:3SG

               ‘That is why we have made this raft.’ [F9]
The series in ada- refers to entities and/or locations which                     are
not taken to be remote (in particular, they can be visible for
the speaker), but are not directly available and/or not under the
speaker’s control; such entities often belong or are nearer to the
addressee or to a third person:
 (456)     a. ediy      Cilge          met-in     kej-k

Finally, the Distal series in ta@ refers to entities and/or locations
which are considered remote and invisible to the speaker:
 (457)   a. tay     mémeé gol+l’e?
            that    bear  where+be(ITR:3sc)?
            ‘Where is that bear?’ [F17]

            want-CAUS-OF:38G
            ‘T want to return to the days of my youth.’ [F58]
The Locative demonstratives of the ¢a-series can be combined with
the item ejmz ‘across, on the other side’ (see 3.1.5.2 on its use as a
postposition; cf. also Krejnovich 1982:237). In contrast with the
simple forms, such combinations can be used only in the deictic
function:
 (458)   a. ejmi+ta-nide         qon-delle      izulbe
            [across-therc-DIR    go-SS:PFV]    tiredness

           g0-CAUS-FUT-TR:1PL
            ‘Let us go there and have a rest.’ [F31|

           gaqga-te-je
           arrive-FUT-INTR:1SG
           ‘If I reach that place there, I will be able to reach the
           tent.’
The nominal Demonstratives tugn and adugn can be used as deic-
tic subjects of a cleft-like construction, whereby the deictic element
is followed by a complete Focus-marking clause (see 12.2.3).
1.2.2.2. The anaphoric function.      The demonstrative pronoun
tabun is often used to pick up a previously mentioned entity. This
is the only way to refer back to an inanimate entity (459); for ref-
246      Chapter    7.   Morphology        of closed classeserence to an animate entity, a personal pronoun can be used as
well. Generally, the demonstrative (in contrast with a personal
pronoun) involves a certain amount of contrast. In particular, it
often refers to the entity introduced in the previous sentence as
the grammatical Focus:
 (459)     a. tay           pulut               nume-yin            gqon-delle      tude

Moreover, the demonstratives are strikingly more common in the
grammatical Focus position than the personal pronouns (460); see
12.3.2.3 on the pronominal Focus.
 (460)         Euge-ge                gon-u-t                    nube-lek

               some vegetable roots. That. was what she
               brought.’ [F48]
The other Nominal demonstratives are impossible in this function.
                                                            Pronouns      247   The Attributive demonstrative toy (or, much more rarely, tiz)
can be used as a determiner when the noun phrase refers to an
aforementioned entity:
 (461)   a. tay      pajpe    atag-un      ug-n’e-l’el
            that     woman    two-ATTR     child-PRPR-INFR(3SG)
            ‘That woman had two children.’ [F7]

            ‘These hunters were pursuing it, but not catching
            up.’ [F34]
In addition, there is a complex         Attributive form   tin+tan     ‘that’
(Krejnovich 1982:237), which can be used only to refer back to
an aforementioned entity, i.e., this form resolves the ambiguity
between deictic and anaphoric interpretations of the Attributive
demonstratives:
(462)    a. tintay     atag-un      pajpe-d+upr-pe            pude
            that       two-ATTR     woman-ATTR+child-PL       outside

            ‘That old woman gave (him) some tea.’ [F19]
Krejnovich (1982:237) suggests that this form represents the frozen
combination of the Attributive demonstratives tin ‘this’ and tay
‘that’. In addition to this form, he cites a nominal complex form
tin-tamun, which is not attested in my corpus.
1.2.2.3. The resumptive function. The Nominal demonstratives
are often used to refer to an aforementioned event as a whole;
this function is particularly typical for the demonstrative tabun
~ tamun, yet tugn is also possible (see also 14.2.1.2):
248      Chapter 7. Morphology of closed classes (463)     a. unuy-gen            ta       irk-in             mieste-gen

The demonstrative pro-forms can also be used as main clause cor-
relates for correlative subordinate clauses (see 13.5.3).
1.2.2.4. Discourse-linking function. The distal Demonstratives in
ta, in particular the Ablative form tat and the Local forms of the
Nominal demonstrative tabun, serve as a very general device link-
ing a clause to the preceding discourse (see 14.2.1.2, 14.3). In
this function, these forms can be glossed as ‘then, so, thus, that is
why’, etc.; the form fat serves as most semantically vague connec-
tive adverbial (it is therefore represented as CA in the interlinear
glosses.)

The      pronoun    pgn ~ pen can refer to the physical environment
(with a meaning like ‘world’, ‘nature’, ‘environment’, etc.; see
(465)-(466}), or to the physical condition of a person (467). The
former meaning is most often evoked               in descriptions of weather
situations, seasonal changes, etc.            (465); see also 9.2.2.2 for this
clause pattern.      However, a less conventionalized usage is possible
as well (466) (for convenience, this word is glossed as ‘it’ in the
interlinear translations).

considered the bound (grammaticalized) form of pgn ~ pen.*®
250      Chapter 7. Morphology of closed classes1.3. Interrogative pro-forms
Most interrogative pro-forms are derived from the interrogative
stem go- ~ ga-. e.g., godo ‘how’, godi-t ‘why’, gamun ‘how many’
(for more interrogatives, see Table 19); there are three other in-
terrogative words, two interrogative pronouns, kin ‘who, whose’
and leme ~ neme ‘what, who’, and the Interrogative adverbial
noyon ‘what for’. The Interrogative pronouns have the regular
mon-Possessive nominal paradigm (as described in 5.1), but for-
mally slightly different predicative forms, kin-tek and lem-dik ~
nem-dik respectively (Krejnovich 1982:234-235):
 (468)     a. kin-tek           jagte-l?
               who-PRED        sing-SF
               ‘Who is singing?’ [F13]

               ‘What are you afraid of on the earth?’ [F31]
The      Interrogatives      are    used    in     direct   and   indirect   questions
(13.2.2, 13.5.2) and in correlative subordinate clauses (see 13.5.3).
   The Locative Interrogative gon ‘where’ and the Manner inter-
rogative godo ‘how’ can form phonological complexes with the ex-
istential verb l’e ‘be’: gol+l’e- ‘Where is/was?’ (see 19.2.2.1),
godo+l’e- ‘How is/was?’ (see 13.2.2.2). The latter combines also
with the verb a- ‘make’: god-a- ‘What/how did {A) behave with

Discontinuity of NPs is not frequent, yet possible. First, a modifier
can be post-posed, while the nominal head occupies its typical
preverbal position (the elements of a discontinuous constituent
are shown by reversed angle brackets in the intcrlinear glosses):

               out.’ [F31]
Secondly, a Nominal clause can be interrupted by the main verb, so
that a constituent of the Nominal clause is postposed; in (627a), it
is the comitative adjunct associated with the subject of the Action
Nominal clause, in (627b), an adverbial clause subordinated to the
Result Nominal in the clause-initial position:

               two baskets.’ [F 2]2. Overview           of verb patterns
2.1.     Introductory notes
Generally, the transitivity of a clause is fully determined by its
main verb. As shown in 9.1, in Yukaghir this property is associ-
ated rather with the pragmatic (information structuring) roles of
the NPs, rather than with their case role semantics. To put it a
little bit too straightforwardly, the transitive pattern is the Topic-
Focus pattern, rather than the Agent-Patient one. Accordingly,
intransitivity is associated with a single NP which is conceived of
as the most appropriate candidate for both “communicative” roles.
                                             Overview of verb patterns   347This ensures a very wide domain of application of the transitive
pattern, i.e., this pattern covers situation types which are very far
from the semantic prototype of transitivity (including such mean-
ings as ‘be afraid of’, ‘speak about’, ‘stand on’, ‘laugh at’, etc.,
see 2.3). In fact, the vast majority of two-slot patterns and all the
patterns with more than two slots are transitive.
    Apart from the core participants, Yukaghir shows a rather close
correspondence between the case marking and the role interpreta-
tion of a slot. Instances of conventionalized deviations from the
case semantics (as described in 5.4.2) are very rare. They can be
summarized as follows:
  1. Some transitive verbs have Body Part slots for the Ablative
     or the Prolative NP (2.3.2).
  2. Both intransitive (2.5.1) and transitive (2.5.2) verbs can have
     the Ablative slot with partially unpredictable role semantics.
     Although in most cases the Ablative slot in such patterns
     can be described (more or less appropriately) in terms of a
     metaphorical “source” or “starting point”, its specific instances
     appear to be conventional. Note, however, that the Ablative
     lends itself most easily (of all peripheral cases) to various
     metaphorical extensions,    independently     of its usage within
     verb patterns; see 5.4.2.5.2).
  3. There are marginal     intransitive patterns with the Locative
     Experiencer (2.7.2.1) and the Dative Experiencer (2.7.1). The
     latter seems   to be closely associated     with the Benefactive
     (Malefactive) function of the Dative (see 5.4.2.1).
  4. Some verbs have a slot which can be filled either by the Loca-
     tive NP or by the Dative NP. For the verbs of movement (“Di-
     rectional” slot, see 2.6), this variability could be accounted for
     in terms of the “adverbial” nature of the slot. It should be
     noted, however, that the directional reading of the Locative
     is possible only within this pattern. Furthermore, the same
     variability is preserved in the metaphorical applications of
     the Directional pattern (7.1.6), as well as in the peripheral
     Experiencer slot (at least for some verbs; see 2.7.2).
348     Chapter 9. Syntax of the clauseNote that there are two types of valence patterns which are not dis-
cussed here: copular patterns (see 12.1) and patterns with propo-
sitional slots ({1.1-11.2).","[365, 366, 367, 368]"
"3. Quantifiers
Quantifiers comprise cardinal numerals (7.2.1), universal quanti-
fiers (7.1.5), and scalar quantifiers (éa- ‘be few’, ninge- ‘be many’),
see also 2.1.3 for quantification phrases. This section describes
only the scalar quantifiers. The scalar quantifiers belong to the
class of verbs.
 (584)     a. lebejdi           ninge-7
               berries        be.many-INTR:3SG
               ‘There were a lot of berries.’
           b. éugl’e-dt+omni                        para-ge        éomolben
              ancient-ATTR+people                   time-Loc       elk
              éa-l’el
               be.few-INFR{INTR:3SG)
               ‘In the ancient people’s time, there were few elk.’ [F34]
                                                                       Quaentifiers   311
When     used as noun           modifiers,      they take the verbal Active At-
tributive form (6.1.2.2). The same lexical items are used for scalar
quantification of count nouns (585) and mass nouns (586}. The
head noun takes the Singular form (see 5.3.1.4, 5.3.1.5).
 (585)   a. met       ninge-j                    Soromo-k
            I         {be.many-ATTR]             person-PRED

            ‘I plagued many people.’ [F31]
         b. ninge-7                     nodo-k          §agal’a-l’el-ni-l

            ‘Many birds gathered.’ [F5]
         c. met       mieste-ge         €a-je              lebejdi-k         l’e-l
            I         place-Loc         [be.few-ATTR]      berry-PRED        be-SF
            ‘At my place there were few berries.’
(586)    a. &a-je          legul-ek      kej-met
            [be.few-ATTR] food-PRED give-OF:2PL
            “You have given me little food.’
         b. ninge-j                     legul-ek        nado+yo-l,
            [be.many-ATTR]              food-PRED       necessary-STAT-SF
            n'er-ek,             oz-k
            cloth-PRED           water-PRED
            ‘We need a lot of food, (we need) clothing, (we need)
            water.’ [F31]
If the quantified NP is the direct object, the scalar quantifier can
float to the preverbal position. In this construction, the quantifier
takes a special form in -6, thus:
(587)    a. terike,     legul     ningo         a-k
            wife        food      many          make-IMP:2SG
            ‘Wife, make a lot of food.’ [F24]
         b. lebejdi-le ningo Sagal’c-3-l’el-na
            berries    many   gather-CAUS-INFR-3PL:TR
            “They have gathered a lot of berries.’
312      Chapter 8.   Noun    phrase    and postpositional phrase            c. tolow         tat   ningo        nuy-t
               deer   CA many      find-TR:1PL
               ‘We have found lots of deer.’
           d. legul-e         €alo       kej-ya
              food            little     give-3PL:TR
               ‘They gave a small amount of food.’
            e. anil     naha           Gale   it-de-j
               fish     very       little get.caught-CAUS-TR:1PL
               ‘We have caught a very small amount of fish.’
The distinction between the “internal” quantification (as in (586))
and the construction with quantifier floating is clearly associated
with the grammatical Focus (see {2.2-12.3): quantifier floating is
used if the O participant itself is outside the scope of assertion
(hence, cannot be marked for the grammatical Focus). Scalar
quantifiers in the modifier function regularly attract grammatical
Focus marking; see (586).
   If the object NP is recoverable from the context, it can                   be
dropped, so that only the quantifier is present in the clause:
 (588)     a. met-in          éald       kej-met
               I-DAT          little     give-TR:2PL
               ‘You have given me a small amount (of it).’
           b. ningo pundie-nu-lel-u-m
              many     tell-IPFV-INFR-0-TR:3SG
              n’e-leme-die-le          el+ahid’s-t
               [NEG-what-DIM-INSTR NEG+conceaL-Ss:IPFV|
               ‘He told a lot, without concealing anything.’ [F50]
   Apparently, a similar construction with quantifier floating is
possible for cardinal verbs (7.2.1.2), yet it occurs very rarely:
 (589)         mit     éomdlben-pe             d’e      n’elbe-t-i   ataglo
               we elk-PL        DP skin-TR:1PL                       two
               “We skinned both elk.’
See also 7.1.5.1 on the syntactic behavior of the universal quanti-
fier.
                                                            NP   conjunction   3134, NP    conjunction
Following Stassen (forthcoming), the concept of NP conjunction
is taken to cover all cases where one type of participation in the
event is ascribed to two (or more) separate entities (represented
by different lexical items). Yukaghir has three different strategies
for NP conjunction, which make use of the Comitative case (4.1),
asyndeton (4.2) and the connective adverb tahile (4.3).","[330, 331, 332, 333]"
"5.5.2. The Stative form
The copula o- ‘be’ (12.1.1.2) has the bound variant-+70-, which
can be used to create the Stative form ‘be X’. The Stative form
is not very common for genuine Yukaghir nouns (5.5.2.1); yet this
marking appears to play a major role in borrowing of Russian
adjectives (5.5.2.2).

contrast with the Yukaghir qualitative verbs (4.3.2}, Russian ad-
jectives are nominal, a fact which is obviously perceived by Yuk-
aghirs (given their native or near-native competence in Russian,
see 2.2). In order to overcome this contradiction, the Stative form
is employed when a Russian adjective is inserted into a Yukaghir
126      Chapter 5. Nominal morphologysentence.      In this way, the Russian        adjectives are “transformed”
into Yukaghir qualitative verbs:

The Stative form is employed for a new Russian-based modal con-
struction with nado ‘is necessary’ (see 9.2.7.1, 11.1.2) and consti-
tutes the morphological basis for the Transformative form (5.5.3)
5.5.3. The Transformative form
The Transformative form is created by means of the elements -70-t
or-70-n, which can be morphologically analyzed as the Imperfec-
tive converb of the Stative (as in (242)) and the Stative-based
adverb (see 4.3.3, 4.2) respectively. These variants are used more
or less in the same way, showing at most some tendencies towards
a semantic distribution, rather than a clear semantic distinction.
    Most often, the Transformative is used as an argument of the
verb kude- ‘to become, to happen, to begin’ (see 12.1.3.1.1). In
this function the two variants of the form are semantically equal
(‘to become X, to turn into X’), see (244)-(245). The form in -¢ is
commonly followed by the variant gude- of the verb (see 3.2.1.2)
and (245b)).

word employed.               The question word                godo ‘how’ can be used not

5.3.2.    Correlative relative clauses
Correlative relative clauses are made                up as finite indirect ques-
tions, with the demonstrative pronoun tamun ‘that’ (889a)-(889b)
or a full NP (890) serving as the correlate in the main clause; in one
instance, the correlate in the main clause is the universal quantifier
(889c),
      This pattern can be used for the same types of relativization as
the Attributive relative clauses (12.3.1): for relativization of the
subject (889a), of the direct object (889b)-(889c), of the Possessor
(890a), of the temporal (890b) and spatial (890c) adverbial. The
spatial relative clause (890c) can combine a question word with the
Result Nominal form (cf. the similar effect in correlative adverbial
clauses constructed according to the same pattern).

1. Grammaticalized             coreference phenomena
1.1.    Clause-internal phenomena
1.1.1. Participant reflexivization
The only explicit means of assigning two participant roles in a
clause to a single referent is the Reflexive marking on the verb,
which is described in 6.4.5.3, The controller of such reflexiviza-
tion is always the A participant, the target, the O participant.
Accordingly, a pronoun in the direct object function can only be
non-reflexive,
   If a participant other than O is coreferential with the subject,
the regular personal pronouns are used, so that only the context
can disambiguate reflexive vs. non-reflexive use of a pronoun. The
sentences in (891) give examples of reflexively and non-reflexively
used Dative personal pronouns. The sentences in (892) illustrate
reflexively used personal pronouns in other syntactic positions.

"2.2.1. The connective particle aj ~ ajz ‘too, again, still’
The particle aj is employed to link a clause to a clause referring to
a (semantically) similar situation, most often signified by the same
verb. In the simplest case, the situations linked by means of this
particle are just two occurrences of the same situation, with the
same sets of participants. In this case the particle can be glossed
as ‘again’ (if the clause describes the second occurrence of the
situation, (913), (914)) or ‘too’ (if it describes the first occurrence
(914)). The clauses involved need not be adjacent (e.g., in (913a)
two instances of the particle refer back to two different preceding
clauses). The particle takes the preverbal position:

If such clauses are adjacent, the particle can occur in both of them
(914a). Note that the linear order of the clauses can be reversed
with respect to the temporal order of the situations (914b):

The same    particle can link clauses describing similar situations
with distinct sets of involved participants. The examples in (915)
illustrate the case where the situations differ in one participant
slot. In (916), the participants are rearranged with respect to
their roles in the situation. If the NP representing the changed
participant is not adjacent to the verb form, the particle normally
takes the postnominal position (916b)         (otherwise, the preverbal
and postnominal positions cannot be distinguished). If this NP
is marked as the grammatical Focus, the particle takes the pre-
nominal position (see (915d), (919a)).1°4

In a few cases, this particle establishes              a link between a           finite
clause and a non-finite clause within the same sentence:

           woman began to sing, too.’ [F41|]

           awning-PRPR-3PL:INTR
           “Where they had the house, they had an awning
           too.’ [F54|
The variant      ajz is used   if the clause does not describe another
occurrence of a situation, but the same protracted situation (which
is thereby marked to take place still, although the time reference
has changed). The variant @j can occur in this case as well. In this
context, the particle can be glossed as ‘still’ or ‘yet’, depending on
whether the clause is positive or negative:

           CP      live-INTR:2SG      CP     NEG+di¢-INTR:2SG

           ‘I was still gathering berries.’ [T2]
532      Chapter   14.   Coreference   and   discourse    coherenceIn transitive clauses, the variant aj: can mean ‘more’ (with the
scope over the O participant), in contrast with aj (which can only
mean      ‘too’ in similar contexts).                     Note that the meanings ‘still’
and ‘more’ can be distinguished by means of the linear position
of the particle, cf. (918c) and (919a). If the construction involves
quantifier floating (8.3), the particle is placed before the quantifier
(919).105

The enclitic -de ~ -te (the latter variant occurs after voiceless
consonants) establishes a rather loose and semantically nonspe-
cific link (‘and, too’) with the immediately preceding clause. It
is attached to the first word of the clause (even if it is an NP
modifier; see (920a), (920b)).

This particle can also function as a sort of contrastive marker, i.e.,
it contrasts the clause to some implied presupposition (‘even’), In
this function, this particle is attached to the constituent it focuses
(921c). It is often combined with an intensifier (921a)-(921b).
