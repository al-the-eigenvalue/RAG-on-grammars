"4.3.5.7 The relative sentence head in the matrix clause
The relative sentence’s head can function either as the subject or as non-subject
argument (i.e. object or complement) in the matrix clause. (135), showing the
appropriate bracketing, is a sentence in which the head functions as the subject. The
constituent order in this sentence as a whole conforms to the basic SOV word order.",[336]
"
6.1 Basic constituent order
The basic constituent order in a clause in Makalero is SOV. This overall order holds
for both kinds of verb-phrase-internal arguments. Thus, O has to be understood here
as a cover term for both object and complement arguments as introduced in § 5.2
                                                  THE CLAUSE                                      387
(p. 319). For illustration, (12) shows a clause with a semantically intransitive verb
with SV order, and (13) one with a transitive verb, with SOV order.","[411, 412]"
"
9.2.1 Non-canonical word orders
Non-canonical word orders are overall relatively rare; the overwhelming majority of
clauses found in natural discourse conform to the unmarked SOV word order.
In sentences with non-canonical word orders, a constituent is generally left-
dislocated. The syntactic position involved in left-dislocation is the LDP, discussed
in detail in § 7.6.1 (p. 427). Note that this position is on sentence-level, rather than
clause-level; as such, left-dislocated constituents can be separated from the clause
they belong to by an intervening adverbial or other clause.",[520]
"
1.6.5 The verb phrase
Most of the complexity of Makalero grammar is found in the domain of the verb
phrase, which is strictly head-final. The main characteristic feature of the verb
phrase is that there are two distinct positions for the verb phrase-internal argument
(see § 5.2, p. 319). The first of these positions, termed object position, is the leftmost
element of the VP. It is followed by the aspect and negation markers as well as verb-
phrase-internal adverbials. The second position, labelled complement position,
immediately precedes the verb and in fact forms a morphosyntactic unit with it. This
unit may be overtly marked by the use of a reduced form of the complement or a
bound form of the verb, or both. The two argument positions are mutually exclusive.
Either of them fills the verb’s single non-subject argument position. While the object
position holds only undergoer NPs, the complement position can contain either
nominal or verbal constituents. The nominal constituents express either undergoers
or locations and goals. Verbal complements, which are fully-fledged VPs except for
the fact that the verb may be in a dependent form, generally convey locative or
manner information. This construction type is also used in forming causatives,
comparatives, modal modifications, directionality, and the like (§ 5.2.2.5, p. 339).
There is some degree of flexibility between the object position and the complement
position for nominal arguments. This holds particularly for pronominal undergoers,
the position of which varies considerably. In many instances, it is a lexical property
of a given verb whether a nominal argument is realised as an object or as a
complement.
Any ditransitive verb, even those which are semantically intransitive and thus not
associated with an undergoer participant, is compatible with a verbal complement
expressing location or manner. If such adverbial information is expressed in the
complement position, the undergoer (if one is associated with the verb in question)
can no longer stand in the same predication, but must be expressed in a separate
predication with the help of the light verb mei ‘take’. The complement thus fills the
verb’s argument position. The fact that even semantically intransitive verbs are
compatible with a complement shows that any verb is syntactically divalent.
Verbal modifiers include an aspect marker hai, expressing the beginning of a new
situation, a negator nomo as well as a variety of VP-internal adverbials. § 3.2.3.3.1
(p. 159) analyses these as a subclass of full verbs which can alternatively be used as
modifiers within the VP.
24                                    CHAPTER 1
1.6.6 The clause
The unmarked word order in the clause is SOV. The subject argument generally has
little repercussion on the rest of the clause. With a number of verbs which inflect for
subject number, the number of the subject (whether overtly marked or not)
determines the form of the verb. Apart from this, the use of the reflexive pronoun ni
marks coreferentiality with the subject. Furthermore, the NP clitic =ini, analysed in
§ 9.2.3.1 (p. 501) as a contrastive marker, appears to be developing into a subject
marker, which is used whenever a speaker considers word order alone not to be
enough to clarify the subject referent. This may be the case in sentences with non-
canonical word order, or if the subject argument is considerably lower on the topic-
worthiness hierarchy than the second argument.
As mentioned in § 5.2 (p. 319), the non-subject argument can syntactically be
realised in two ways, namely either as an object or as a complement. Either of these
is a possible filler of the verb’s syntactic argument position. Any additional
arguments need to be expressed in a separate clause. Such multi-clause units are
termed ‘sentences’ and discussed in § 7 (p. 401).
Operators (as defined by Van Valin and LaPolla 1997: 40) that work on clause-level
in Makalero are aspect, negation and status.","[48, 49]"

‘it is her’ if seen as the nominal predicate in a minimal clause of its own. This is
followed by the predicate tu ‘go first’; the clause combination of kiloo=ni tu would
thus translate as ‘it was her (and she) went first’. Similarly, ani (1s) in the second
sentence as a nominal predicate translates as ‘it is me’. It is followed by the
predicate sofit ‘go behind’, and the two combine as something like ‘it is me (and I)

went behind’. Note how these literal translations resemble English cleft
constructions.
It has been elaborated in § 6.2.1 (p. 389) that =ini appears to be evolving into a
subject marker. As such, it is found frequently in sentences with non-canonical word
order. Particularly in cases where the object is left-dislocated and the grammatical
roles are not clarified by other criteria (such as world knowledge or the topic-
worthiness hierarchy, see § 6.2.1, p. 389), it is important to mark the subject
participant as such, since both an SOV sentence as well as a sentence with OSV
order look superficially identical, namely NP – NP – V. In such cases, it is the
marker =ini which ensures the correct interpretation of the sentence. Examples
where the object precedes a subject marked as such by =ini are given in (34) and
(35).","[527, 528]"
"
1.6.9 Discourse structure
Since Makalero has no case marking and no verbal agreement, and allows for the
left-dislocation of participants, the correct interpretation of grammatical roles is
potentially problematic. However, there are several devices aiding the hearer in this
respect. An important indicator helping reference tracking across the text are the
clause linkers =ini and =isi. As noted in § 8.1.1 (p. 457), the former is commonly
associated with topic (or subject) continuity, while the use of the latter normally
coincides with a topic change. Another grammatical item that contributes to
reference tracking is the reflexive pronoun ni, which, both as an NP on its own as
well as in adnominal use, denotes coreference with the subject participant. As such,
any NP containing this pronoun is necessarily a non-subject. Furthermore, the
contrastive marker =ini appears to be developing into a subject marker that is used to
clarify subject reference in sentences with non-canonical word order or cases where
the subject argument is much lower on the topic-worthiness hierarchy than the
second argument. Also, the NP clitic =haka, which serves to mark the contradiction
to a presupposition, occurs on subject arguments only. As such, it has a secondary
subject-marking function.
The majority of sentences in Makalero follows the unmarked SOV word order.
However, either argument may be placed in the left-detached position. These left-
dislocated arguments may be both topics and foci. Most foci in the LDP are
relatively long and may be taken up in situ by a pronoun. As such, § 9.2.1.2 (p. 498)
concludes that the issue in those cases is the length of the constituent in question
rather than its focality. Consequently, the main function of the LDP is to hold topics.
§ 9.2.2 (p. 500) discusses an explicit focus construction in which a clause with an
empty position is followed by the same or a very similar clause with that position
filled. This focus construction quite nicely implements the common definition of
focus as the part of a proposition by which the assertion differs from the
presupposition.
Makalero disposes of a number of clitic or adverbial markers which have to do with
information structure. The most important of these is the contrastive clitic =ini. This
                                         INTRODUCTION                                       27
is found on both topical and focal participants. It is likely an extension of the clause
linker =ini and appears to separate the contrastive argument from the rest of the
clause. As such, these constructions display a high degree of similarity to cleft
constructions. The clitic =haka marks the contradiction of a presupposition. Na’a-
muni, which is predicative in status, equivalent to avalent adverbial predicates,
appears to mark the beginning of a new scene or event. The clitic =oo ‘too’ is a
frequently used concessive linker. However, it also occurs in a variety of cases,
often in pairs, where this translation does not make sense. As such, it appears to
have some information structuring use, which requires further research.
On a higher level of text organisation, it is noticeable that narratives are normally
introduced by a sentence stating the content of the text. These sentences are very
frequently associated with a particular word order. Texts are normally concluded by
a closing sentence, which states that the speaker is finished.
A conspicuous feature of Makalero narratives is the use of tail-head linkage. A
feature characteristic of ritual speech, lexical parallelism, has in some expressions
also found its way into everyday speech.","[51, 52]"

                         Figure 1.1: The Eastern Timor languagesThe exact position of Bunak, spoken in the centre of the island (Schapper 2009), in a
family tree representing all four of the Papuan languages of Timor is not quite clear.
With respect to higher-level classification, the non-Austronesian languages of Timor
have had a chequered history. The non-Austronesian nature of Bunak and Makasae
was first recognised by Capell (1943a, 1943b, 1944), who regarded them as Papuan
on account of their structure. Cowan (1965: 361) supported this view and suggested
a relation of the non-Austronesian languages of Timor to those of the Bird’s Head in
Indonesian New Guinea. Capell (1975) finally argued for the grouping of all non-
Austronesian languages of Timor and the neighbouring islands of Alor and Pantar
with the languages of the Bird’s Head and the Bomberai peninsula; these in turn are
argued to be a member of the extensive Trans-New Guinea phylum in Voorhoeve
(1975). This classification has since largely been upheld (see e.g. Wurm 1982, 1983
and Ross 2005).9
The Trans-New Guinea family, which covers a large part of the New Guinea
mainland as well as some nearby islands, may contain more than 500 languages.
Several researchers, among them Pawley (2005: 73), emphasise that the Timor-Alor-
Pantar languages are highly aberrant among Trans-New Guinea languages. Despite
that family’s enormous size and the fact that its members exhibit a wide range of
structural variation, it follows from such remarks that it is nevertheless possible to
identify a typical Papuan, or Trans-New Guinea, language type. A summary of

  Note, however, that it is contested in Donohue and Schapper (forthcoming); the final word on the
classification on the Timor-Alor-Pantar group has thus not yet been spoken.

than these, Makalero is quite distinct from the typical Papuan language with respect
to its phonological characteristics.

marking, for which serial verb constructions are widespread in Papuan languages;
although the present thesis does not use the term SVC, the adverbial verbs used to
express the majority of the TAM categories in the form of distinct predications may
qualify as such. In all other respects, Makalero deviates from the Papuan language
type.

word order, as well as the place of the determiner and the modifier with a noun.
Makalero agrees with Foley’s 22 characteristic Papuan features 10 as reproduced in
Tables 1.3. through 1.5, in only 8 instances, most of which are found in syntax.
Apart from the vocabulary, syntax thus provides the strongest argument for its
classification as Papuan.11
Foley (1998: 506f.) contrasts this Papuan language type with an ‘Austronesian
language type’. The characteristics he lists for this language type may perhaps
adequately represent the Austronesian languages in the New Guinea area but cannot
be said to be characteristic of the Austronesian family as a whole and are thus not
reproduced here. Notably, however, Makalero agrees with Foley’s Austronesian
language type to more or less the same degree (i.e. number of features) as it does
with the Papuan language type. With respect to other features, it does not group
clearly with either of the two contrasting language types. Over very similar results,
Schapper (2009: 31) concludes that Papuan Bunak displays “a particular ‘insular
eastern Indonesian’ linguistic type which cross-cuts the distinction between Papuan
and Austronesian.” This conclusion clearly also holds for Makalero.
Interestingly, Klamer, Reesink and Staden (2008) propose an East Nusantara
linguistic area, in which Austronesian and Papuan languages coexist and share a
number of features which are partly of Papuan, partly of Austronesian origin. It must
be noted, however, that this linguistic area is based on only five relatively broad
features, of which only two are clearly manifested in Makalero (i.e. possessor-
possessum order in adnominal possession and the presence of an inclusive /

   The total of 22 counts the syntactic features in Table 1.5 each separately, despite the fact that most of
them are concomitants of SOV.
11
   Note, however, that word order is not a sound basis for language classification, since languages may
change their basic word order (see Heine 2008: 34f. for some contact-induced examples of this process).

exclusive distinction in the personal pronoun paradigm). Note also that Donohue
(2004)12 denies the validity of an area with linguistically definable borders in Central
and Eastern Indonesia. Instead, he claims the region is part of a typological
continuum between Northern, Western and Eastern Austronesian languages.","[37, 38, 39, 40, 41]"

3.3.1 Pronouns
Pronouns function as “shifting referring expressions within the context of ongoing
speech” (Foley 1986: 66). In other words, they “exhibit a one-to-many relationship”
(Foley 1986: 65) with respect to their referents. They contrast in this respect with the
situation as found in nouns, which bear a “one-to-one constant relationship” (ibid.)
to their referents. Pronouns have in common with nouns that they are referring
expressions. Also, they commonly head NPs, though they can also modify nouns
and verbs. It appears that pronominal NP heads are not compatible with all of the
dependents to a nominal head associated with the noun phrase (see § 3.3.1.1,
p. 218).
Pronouns found in Makalero include personal pronouns, as discussed in § 3.3.1.1
(p. 218), as well as reflexive and reciprocal pronouns (§ 3.3.1.2, p. 227, and
§ 3.3.1.3, p. 228), interrogative pronouns (§ 3.3.1.4, p. 228) and an indefinite
pronoun (§ 3.3.1.5, p. 231).

possessive forms for use as possessive modifiers in the NP (§ 3.3.1.1.3, p. 225).
Unlike Fataluku and Bunak (see e.g. Hull 2004: 80f), Makalero does not make a
distinction between subject and object pronouns. The third person pronouns are, in
this and other respects, somewhat exceptional (see § 3.3.1.1.2, p. 221). Makalero
pronouns are invariable and are used in both subject and object function, as shown
in (350) and (351), where the correct interpretation of grammatical relations relies
solely on the word order.","[242, 243]"

presupposition (§ 3.5.1.2, p. 244) is only found with subjects. This marker is
relatively rare and hence not very important in reference tracking. Nevertheless, any
NP marked by =(h)aka is necessarily a subject. See also § 9.3.1 (p. 507) for tail-
head linkage, which, too, contributes to reference tracking.

9.2 Information structure
The terminology used in the present short discussion of information structure
follows Lambrecht (1996) in most respects. In that work, information structure is
defined as “that component of sentence grammar in which propositions as
conceptual representations of states of affairs are paired with lexicogrammatical
structures in accordance with the mental states of interlocutors who use and interpret
these structures as units of information in given discourse contexts” (ibid: 5). A
referent is interpreted as the topic of a proposition “if in a given situation the
proposition is construed as being about this referent, i.e. as expressing information
which is relevant to and which increases the addressee’s knowledge of this referent”
(Lambrecht 1996: 131). Focus, on the other hand, is defined as “[t]he semantic
component of a pragmatically structured proposition whereby the assertion differs
from the presupposition” (Lambrecht 1996: 213). In discourse, the correlation
between subject and topic is generally very strong. In a typical clause, the predicate
asserts new information about this topic; it is thus the focus. This neatly describes
the unmarked case, in which the subject is the topic and the object part of the focus,
in Makalero. However, other constellations of topic and focus structure and the
grammatical expression of a sentence are possible. These are discussed below in so
far as they find grammatical expression in discourse. § 9.2.1 (p. 495) gives some
observations on non-canonical word orders, § 9.2.2 (p. 500) treats a specific focus
construction, and § 9.2.3 (p. 500) discusses some particles related to the structuring
of information.","[519, 520]"

§ 5.2.2.1, p. 321).
Another possible type of non-subject argument is a dependent VP. Such VPs can
only be constructed as complements. § 5.2.2.4 (p. 337) argues that syntactically,
such VP arguments in complement-verb complexes are treated in the same way as
nominal arguments in that either fill the predicate’s syntactic non-subject argument
postion. An example of this is given in (33), where rau ‘good’ fills the complement
position of the transitive verb pase ‘beat’, causing the semantic undergoer of the
beating action, ani (1s), to be expressed in a separate clause with mei ‘take’.(33)     ... papa     uere ani tafi mei=ni           [rau]COMP-pase.

        ‘… the Indonesian beat me thoroughly.’                             (101-270)This shows that the nature of the syntactic second argument to the verb is
unspecified, and it need not be a participant of the action expressed by the predicate
in question. Rather, it can also be a dependent VP giving circumstantial information
392                                     CHAPTER 6
of various kinds (in (33), this is manner). Thus, what would correspond to arguments
and adjuncts in English are not distinct in status in Makalero, but are treated equally
as non-subject arguments. These arguments can be mapped onto the clause template
in a variety of ways (see § 7.1, p. 402, for a more detailed discussion).
A nominal non-subject argument is preferably lower on the topic-worthiness
hierarchy than the subject. If the reverse is the case, and there are no contextual
clues to help the hearer interpret the clause correctly, the subject is generally marked
as such with the subject marker =ini (see § 6.2.1, p. 389 above). However, there is
no way to specifically mark an object as such.
Just like subjects, objects can be left-dislocated into the left-detached position in the
sentence for pragmatic purposes. For a more in-depth discussion, see § 9.2.1 (p. 495)
on non-canonical word orders.","[416, 417]"

temporal verbs such as aire’ ‘now’, and soohe’ ‘yesterday’, which are commonly
used to indicate adverbial information in the form of a separate clause, have a
syntactic valency of zero. As such, they are not compatible with the expression of
any argument and always form clause cores of their own (see § 3.2.3.1.1, p. 141).
Since either verbal argument can be left unexpressed, the interpretation of the
grammatical role of an overt NP is not trivial. The problem, as well as some
disambiguating strategies, are discussed in § 9.1 (p. 491).
In the remainder of this section, basic constituent order is explained in § 6.1
(p. 386), followed by a description of the constituent parts of the clause. Starting in
§ 6.2 (p. 387), subject arguments are discussed; § 6.3 (p. 391) briefly treats the non-
subject argument, § 6.4 (p. 392) the predicate, and § 6.5 (p. 393) the clause
periphery. § 6.6 (p. 393) discusses operators functioning at clause level or below.

9.3.2 Lexical parallelism
Lexical parallelism is a phenomenon “widely attested in the oral poetry and elevated
speech of a variety of peoples in the world” (Fox 1988: 1). It involves “a pair of
parallel words, one in each section of the text” (Aronoff and Rees-Miller 2003: 463)
and is commonly supported by syntactic parallelism. Generally, the lexical pairs are
made up of synonyms or words with related meanings and form an ordered,
conventional set. According to Fox (1988: 1), the phenomenon is particularly
prominent in Eastern Indonesia. East Timor and Makalero present no exception to
this. However, lexical parallelism is very much connected to high and / or ritual
registers of speech, and most of the Makalero corpus that forms the basis of the
present study consists of everyday speech. Nevertheless, some instances of lexical
parallels have found their way into everyday speech; other texts, such as clan
histories or accounts of wedding customs, draw heavily on ritualised speech. As
such, the present corpus does allow some insight on lexical parallelism in Makalero.
Lexical parallels in Makalero involve both nouns and verbs; also, full parallel VPs
are found. Parallel pairs of these categories are exemplified in (52), (53) and (54),
respectively, where // is used to indicate the parallel.(52)    omar // lopu                                     ‘house’
        stilt.house // house        hala // funu                                     ‘war’
        war // war(53)    na’an // lesa                                    ‘poor’
        NEG.EX // NEG.have        lasi // teri                                     ‘cut’
        cut, chop with a machete // cut with a knife(54)    ira pure // ama paun                             ‘work in the field, plantation’
        work in the paddy // weed the garden        hi’a loke // setur hasa                          ‘clear a way’
        open a road // demolish a fenceFurthermore, characters and toponyms in ritual stories commonly have parallel
names (see e.g. Engelenhoven 1997). The personal name exemplified in (55) is the
person from whose name the language name Makalero is said to derive, while the
place name comes from an account of the migration route of the Loorasa clan. The
meaning of the majority of the elements found in those names is unclear. Note,
however, that in every case, there appears to be a recurring element, i.e. lero in
Ililero // Laualero and ira in Pusira // Panaira.

            1pe REFL-for shelter-do:BD // dry.place-do:BD
         ‘… we build ourselves a home…’                                              (26-06)Pinto, in his 2004 monolingual Makalero dictionary, provides numerous parallel
pairs.
There are two basic semantic types of lexical parallels. The most frequent one in
Makalero by far is that of synonyms or words with related meanings. The meaning
of the combination is the same or similar as that of its constituent parts. Examples
can be seen in (52), (53) and (54) above. Note that for the purpose, both native and
borrowed words are used, as in hala // funu in (52), where hala is the native
Makalero term for ‘war’, while funu is a borrowing from Tetum with the same
meaning.
The other semantic type of lexical parallels is that where two words with different,
sometimes opposite, meanings are combined to denote a superordinate concept
combined out of the meanings of the constituent parts of the pair, as in (59).(59)     ni // upa                                               ‘parents’
         mother // father         kuda // arapau                                          ‘livestock’
         horse // buffalo         teuh // elin                                            ‘bride-price’
         buy // priceSyntactically, the lexical pairs or the phrases containing them are generally
juxtaposed without any kind of linker. (60) through (62) illustrate this with a
nominal, a verbal and a phrasal pair, respectively. Note that on first glance, (61)
seems to contradict the above statement, since the first verb of the pair, li’an ‘fall’ is
cliticised with the clause linker =te’e ‘after’ (§ 3.5.3.1.1.3, p. 252). However, the
512                                      CHAPTER 9
second verb, suri ‘release’, stands with the same linker, showing that =te’e does not
serve as a linker between the two parallel verbs, but is part of the parallel syntactic
structure in which the verbal pair is found, and links the complete parallel structure
to the following clause.","[534, 535, 536, 537]"
"It appears that an important factor determining whether or not a left-dislocated
object NP is recapitulated in situ through a resumptive pronoun is the agent-
worthiness hierarchy, which states that personal pronouns and nouns denoting
human referents are prototypical actors (e.g. Payne 1997: 150). That is, a personal
pronoun is normally understood to be the agent, even if the unmarked order of
subject and object is inverted. Note that in both (138) and (139), the agent is a
personal pronoun; hence it is not absolutely necessary for the preposed object to
reappear in the guise of a pronoun in situ to ensure the correct interpretation of
syntactic roles in the sentence in question. In (137), on the other hand, the left-
dislocated object argument is a pronominal form (see § 3.3.1.1.2, p. 221), and thus a

prototypical agent. To ensure the correct reading of the sentence, it is thus necessary
to take up the left-dislocated constituent as a resumptive pronoun in situ.
In (140), both participants are full NPs. However, an animate, human entity such as
denoted by amuni namiraa ‘male person’ is a far more likely agent-subject than tali
‘rope’, and the sentence is correctly interpreted despite the main arguments’ inverted
order.168(140)      [Tali=ua ue’             ere]OBJ [amuni namiraa]SUBJ=ni [hau-suri]PRED.

The occurrence of =ua on adverbial predicates within multi-clause relative
sentences is discussed above (§ 4.3.5.1, p. 297, and § 4.3.5.2, p. 303); its use in these
constructions appears to mark the beginning of the relative clause. The adverbial
predicate does not function as an argument within the relative clause. An example is
given in (141), repeated from (110) above.(141)      … uerla hai hau tia=te’e [filem [aire’=ua ini=ua nonton=ana]MOD

clauses. An example is given in (142), with two coordinated relative clauses, one
starting with fi (1pi) and the other with ei (2s), both of which are headed by aftane’
(PT).","[337, 338]"

associated with nouns and verbs, respectively. A particularly clear example is the
deictic paradigm (§ 3.2.3.9, p. 180 and § 3.3.2.1, p. 232), which includes nominal
and verbal forms. However, most of these processes are of limited productivity, and
there is a large number of content words which are never used with any derivation.
A working definition of the main lexical categories based on other than
morphological criteria, which can capture these, is thus needed in order to make
generalisations over lexemes belonging to these classes possible.
Haspelmath (2001: 16543) points out that, despite the above-mentioned problems, it
is generally possible to categorise word forms into nouns and verbs in individual
languages. As an example, he gives the word fōma’i ‘doctor’ in Samoan (ibid.),
which can be translated both as ‘doctor’ and ‘being a doctor’. This contrasts with
alu, which translates as ‘go’ and the ‘fact of going’, rather than ‘person who goes’
(ibid.). The former would be categorised as a noun, while the latter is a verb. Such
semantic correspondences can be used in the determination of word classes,
alongside morphological processes, if present, as well as syntactic characteristics.
In the following, I will use a combination of such semantic features as used by
Haspelmath (2001) as well as specific morphological alternations and derivations for
the purpose of distinguishing lexical categories in Makalero. Content words are
classified as belonging to one of the open lexical classes of nouns or verbs. § 3.1
(p. 99) discusses nouns, giving a tentative definition and distinguishing a number of
subgroups based on phonological, morphological and syntactic criteria. § 3.2
(p. 125) proceeds analogously with verbs. Most function words are particles or
affixes that are associated with either the noun phrase or the verb phrase, or clitics
attached on phrase-level. These closed-category items contrast with the open
categories noun and verb in that they do not participate in the functional flexibility
exhibited by those classes. § 3.3 (p. 217) treats closed categories associated with the
noun phrase, while those discussed in § 3.4 (p. 241) are associated with the verb
phrase. § 3.5 (p. 243) introduces a variety of phrase-level clitic. Finally, § 3.6
(p. 264) elaborates on some unclear cases.","[123, 124]"
" 4.3.5.2.1 Relative sentences on subjects in situ
The subject is the first argument in a clause (§ 6.1, p. 386). As such, a relative
sentence on an in-situ subject is distinguishable from one on a left-dislocated subject
only in cases of multi-clausal relative sentences, where an adverbial predicate
precedes the subject slot of the following embedded clause. In the absence of such
an adverbial, the subject is the left-most element in either construction type, and they
are indistinguishable. The two structures are schematically represented in Table 4.2
(see below for examples). Note how a relative sentence on a left-dislocated head and
one on an in-situ head, in the middle column, differ only in the bracketing, unless an
adverbial predicate is present in a multi-clause relative sentence.                                           single clause                    multi-clause con-

As shown to be the case in the above sections (§ 4.3.5.1.1, p. 297, and § 4.3.5.1.2,
p. 299), it is an option to have not only the subject of the relative sentence, but also
its left-most element, the adverbial predicate, marked by the =ua-marker. Precisely
this is the case too with in-situ subjects preceded by adverbials: the clitic =ua can be
attached to both the adverbial as well as the subject. In cases like (116) and (117),
thus, the first =ua on the adverbial predicate shows it to stand within the relative
modifier. The subject, which is the head of the construction, follows this adverbial
and is marked by another =ua.(116)    … sefar ere=haka            to         aire’ ni-asu       uani uere=hi’a

The non-subjects that are found as in-situ heads of relative sentences are all objects,
rather than complements (§ 5.2, p. 319). No clear instances of multi-clause relative
sentences on in-situ objects have been found. These constructions are much more
clearly distinguishable from their counterparts with left-dislocated heads than those
on subjects, where the distinction is dependent on the presence of an adverbial in a
multi-clause construction. With relative sentences on in-situ objects, the head of the
relative sentence stands in the unmarked object position within its clause, preceded
by its subject and followed by its verb. This structure, as well as the contrasting
structure with a left-dislocated head, are schematically represented in Table 4.3.      left-dislocated head                            OHEAD [S V]MOD

"For others, such as isarami ‘brother’ and atanana ‘first’ in (40) above, I have no
indication whatsoever of a separate meaning assignable to any part of the word.
As discussed in § 2.2.3.4 (p. 65), several trisyllabic morphemes contain a long vowel
– one example is puulata ‘head’ in (39) – suggesting that they might be old
compounds with one monosyllabic component. The nucleus of the latter would be
lengthened in order for it to conform to the bimoraicity requirement.
Items longer than two syllables per se meet the bimoraicity requirement.
Grammatical morphemes differ from lexical ones in form: Only lexical, not
grammatical monosyllabic items are required to conform to the bimoraicity
constraint. The majority of grammatical items are either monosyllabic, such as ni
(REFL), hai (NSIT) or =oo ‘too’, or disyllabic, e.g. ani (1s), =ini (LNK1), ere
(1DEM). The former can be both monomoraic, such as ni (REFL), and bimoraic,
such as hai (NSIT). Thus the bimoraicity requirement is a sufficient, but not
necessary, condition for identification of a given morpheme as lexical. In other
words, a lexical morpheme must be bimoraic, but a bimoraic monosyllabic item is
not necessarily a lexical morpheme.
In the domain of lexical morphemes, there seem to be no special correlations
between form and word class. There are nouns, verbs and other word classes among
monosyllabic morphemes; the same holds for disyllabics as well as trisyllabics and
quadrisyllabics (if we choose to accept them as a class in their own right; see the
examples given in (38) through (40) above).

 2.5.2 Morpheme-final closed syllables
Closed syllables are restricted to the morpheme-final position. Correspondingly,
syllables that are followed by one or more additional syllables (that is, morpheme-
initial or morpheme-medial syllables) must be open. The consequence of this is that
there are no consonant clusters in Makalero morphemes.
The occurrence of a consonant cluster within a lexeme indicates that said lexeme is
either a borrowing, as the Portuguese and Indonesian loans in (42) and (43),
respectively, or alternatively a compound, as the words in (44) demonstrate. Even
though there is no indication of what morphemes the latter might be compounded
from, the idea of them being compounds is further supported by the occurrence of
unpredictable long vowels in all of them.(42)      sir.vi.su                                   serviço

echo vowels (see § 2.5.4, p. 80 for more detail). Klamer (2002: 368) lists this
phenomenon as a pervasive feature in the languages that make up her East
Nusantara linguistic area. Indeed many of these languages do not allow for closed
syllables at all. While morphemes ending in closed syllables readily occur in
Makalero, the domain of syllabification is not the morpheme, but the phonological
phrase. This means that whenever possible, a morpheme’s final consonant will be
reassigned into the onset position of the following syllable, as shown below for the
combination of mit ʻsit (SG)’ with the clitic clause linker =ini (§ 3.5.2.5, p. 247).","[102, 103]"

  To my knowledge, little previous research has been done on stress assignment in Timorese languages.
Stoel (2006), in an unpublished paper, discusses stress assignment in the neighbouring language Fataluku.
In that language, too, accents can move to different syllables of the word. Stoel goes on to draw a
distinction between lexical stresses (‘tones’ in his terminology) and boundary tones. The former are
associated with a word and are given in the lexicon, whereas the latter are associated with the end of a
prosodic domain and are inserted by the phonology. Finally Stoel defines a complex set of rules under
which lexical tones move to another syllable or are deleted, and boundary tones are either assigned or not.
He also mentions vowel lengthening under certain conditions. It thus seems that the discussion of stress in
Fataluku concentrates on similar problems as shown above to occur in Makalero. It remains to be seen
whether Stoel’s analysis can be adapted to account for stress in Makalero.
 3. Lexical categories
According to most basic textbooks, a distinction between at least two lexical
categories, namely nouns and verbs, is a universal trait in languages (e.g. Payne
1997: 32). That is, they posit a basic distinction between the expression of objects
and actions, or reference and predication. There is, however, no consensus over this
seemingly basic fact: specific theories may define other sets of basic word classes.
For instance, Croft (2001: 63) argues for three universal basic word classes, namely
nouns, verbs and adjectives, with the chief functions of denoting objects, actions and
properties, respectively. Yet another approach argues that word class distinctions
must be considered a matter of degree (see e.g. Sasse 1993).
Evidence challenging traditional word class theory has, among others, been adduced
from Austronesian languages. Specifically, many individual Austronesian languages
have been analysed as lacking a noun/verb distinction. This may be illustrated by
such examples as (1) and (2) from Tongan (Broschart 1997: 134, examples (15) and
(16)).(1)   na’e lele e      kau       fefiné
      PAST run   SPEC PL:HUM woman.DEF
      ‘The women were running.’(2)   na’e fefine kotoa e         kau     lelé
      PAST woman all         SPEC PL:HUM run.DEF
      ‘The ones running were all female.’These sentences show how the word form fefine ‘woman’ can appear as both an
argument and a predicate, without any overt derivation. The same holds for lele
‘run’, which can be used both as a predicate as well as as an argument. These word
forms appear to be unspecified for lexical category, and it is only their function
within a given clause (i.e. whether they are used in the nominal slot, on the right
edge of the clause in the above examples, or in the verbal slot clause-initially) that
determines their translational equivalents as either arguments or predicates. In fact,
Broschart (1997: 128) arrives at the conclusion that Tongan is a language which
completely lacks a noun/verb distinction. Such characteristics are not restricted to
Tongan, but are fairly widespread in Austronesian languages. These languages are
approximations of Gilʼs (2000: 194, 202) language type with only one single but
open syntactic category. In this language type, “all words and phrases exhibit the
same syntactic behaviour”. A good overview of the issue is given in Himmelmann
(2005).
Makalero, even though no member of the Austronesian family genetically, is spoken
in a larger area dominated by Austronesian languages, and it is similar to these
languages in several respects. Among those is the fact that the translational
equivalents of verbs and nouns can quite freely be used in both argument and
predicate positions, respectively. This characteristic is not commonly associated
with Papuan languages (see § 1.5, p. 12).
98                                              CHAPTER 3
In the Makalero lexicon, there is formal evidence for the distinction between
function words and content words; to wit, there is a bimoraicity requirement for the
latter (see § 2.5, p. 75). This means that a content word has to be either disyllabic or,
if it is monosyllabic, its vowel nucleus has to be long or a diphthong. There is no
such requirement for monosyllabic function words. As such the two lexemes in (3),
ni ‘mother’ and ni (REFL) are clearly distinguished.(3)       ni [ni:]                                     ni [ni]
          ‘mother’                                     (REFL)Within the class of content words, however, the evidence for a distinction between
nouns and verbs is weak. Though a lexeme may prototypically be used as an
argument, it can easily function as a predicate given the right context. Similarly,
lexemes prototypically used in predicate function can be used as arguments. (4) and
(5) exemplify this flexibility with a prototypical verb, the stative isit ‘be ill’. In (4), it
is used as the clause’s main predicate. In (5), on the other hand, the same lexeme
clearly stands in a nominal slot, preceded by the third person possessive marker ki-
(§ 3.3.1.1.3, p. 225) and the definite marker =ee (§ 3.5.1.1, p. 243).55 In this it is the
head of the subject argument to the following predicate, k-ua-misa ‘rise over (it)’.
(6) and (7) illustrate the same with a prototypical noun, meestri ‘teacher’. In (6), it is
part of the subject argument, while in (7), it functions as a predicate.(4)       … asi-atupusi hai nomo isit.
             1s:POSS-belly NSIT NEG           ill

Even though this distinction is not as rigidly grammaticalised in Makalero as in
other languages, there are some indications that suggest it is a relevant factor. For
instance, there are some homophonous pairs of lexemes which carry radically
different meanings depending on their category. Examples are given in (8) and (9).","[120, 121, 122, 123]"

9.1 The determination of grammatical roles
In discourse, the expression of both subject and object participants is in principle
optional (see § 6, p. 383). Either may be omitted if the speaker assumes the hearer
can infer the intended referent from the linguistic or the extra-linguistic context. It
follows that in a sequence of an NP and a transitive verb, it is not necessarily clear
which function the NP has within the clause: since both the subject and the non-
subject arguments are preverbal, an NP preceding a transitive verb could
theoretically be either its subject, with an unexpressed object as in (3), or an object
or complement argument with its verb (or, in other words, a full VP) as in (4). In
either case, Ø marks the locus of the omitted constituent.",[516]

         (ASP)    (ADV)* (NEG)          (ADV)* (COMPL)-HEADIn all cases, the verb phrase is strictly head-final, with all modifiers preceding it. The
only obligatory part of the VP is its head, the predicate. An avalent verb is
compatible only with aspect marking and adverbial modifiers, but does not take any
arguments. The modifiers of a verb phrase headed by divalent verbs, on the other
hand, include aspect marking, verb-phrase-internal adverbials and negation. There
are two positions for adverbials, one preceding and the other following the negation,
allowing for the expression of scope differences. Each of these adverbial positions
can hold one or more adverbial verbs of the group discussed in § 3.2.3.3.1 (p. 159).
The only difference between the two variant schemes for VPs headed by divalent
verbs in (2) and (3) is the position of the non-subject argument, which is VP-initial
in (2), standing to the left of all modifiers, but immediately preverbal in (3), where it
is preceded by all these modifiers. An immediately preverbal non-subject argument
as in (2) forms a morphosyntactic unit with the following predicate, as indicated in
the scheme by the use of the hyphen. In order to distinguish these two argument
positions, the VP-initial position as depicted in (2) is called object position, while
the immediately preverbal position as depicted in (3) is termed complement position.
Both of these positions can hold several coordinated arguments. The schematic
representations in (2) and (3) show that the two positions are mutually exclusive; a

VP with an object argument does not additionally provide a complement position
and vice versa. The issue of the two distinct argument positions within the VP is
discussed in detail in § 5.2 (p. 319).
(4) and (5) illustrate concrete instantiations of a VP with an object and a VP with a
complement, respectively, where the majority of available positions are filled.4)       … ei [[ani]OBJ [hai]ASP [nomo]NEG [mini]HEAD]VP.

and status as either an object or a complement. Finally, § 5.3.1 (p. 361) through
§ 5.3.3 (p. 367) elaborate on aspect marking, negation and adverbials.","[342, 343]"

          ‘The radio called up saying that Agapito Barreto had died.’            (101-354)It has been shown above (see (261) and (262)) that both options also exist as
alternatives with those verbs that have been found with the complementiser =ee
(§ 3.2.3.10.1.1, p. 187).
Note that the verb fatar ‘force’ in (265) has both a preverbal non-subject argument
(presumably an object) as well as a complement clause extension following the verb,
while leu ‘call’ in (266) has a preverbal complement as well as a complement clause
extension. In fact, most of the verbs in Table 3.31 are found in such constructions,
where the complement clause extension follows a complete clause with two
arguments. This seems to contradict the strictly divalent nature of most verbs in
Makalero, which allows for only one argument other than the subject (see
§ 3.2.3.1.2, p. 143, and § 6, p. 383). Complement clause extensions are thus not
syntactic arguments of these verbs: If they functioned as arguments, they would be
expected to fill the verb’s argument position. As a consequence of this, the non-
subject argument and the verbal complement in such sentences as (265) and (266)
would have to be expressed in separate clauses with another verb. The fact that this

is not the case suggests a historical scenario in which such clausal complements
originated as arguments to another verb (§ 3.6.2, p. 265); a likely reflex of such a
construction is the quotative marker ain (§ 3.2.3.12.3, p. 205). (267) shows such a
sentence and gives the analysis.(267)   … papa          ani-asu lolo ani-asu planu ume’                  ere   fani’=kini

probably, fana ‘teach’ coreference of any participant of the complement clause
extension with the non-subject argument is not necessary. The subject of the
complement clause extensions to fatar ‘force’, pada ‘order’ and huma ‘order’, on
the other hand, is generally coreferent with the main verb’s non-subject argument.
An example is (265) above with fatar ‘force’. This coreferent participant is not
generally repeated in the complement clause extension, such that it usually takes the
form of a VP rather than a complete clause including a subject argument. In the case
of the remaining verbs, mot ‘dare’ and fuin ‘dare’, the subject of the complement
clause is generally coreferent with the subject of the main verb. Again, the
coreferent participant is not repeated, resulting in the complement clause taking the
form of a VP.","[215, 216]"

and (124), being head-final, fit the typological profile of Makalero, those shown in
(121) and (122) are untypical. § 3.6.2 (p. 265) suggests that, while using native
material, the order of elements in such sentences may be calqued on Austronesian
languages like Tetum and Indonesian.",[513]
" 3.1.3.5 Numeral classifiers
Makalero makes relatively restricted use of numeral classifiers, which allows for a
categorisation of nouns according to whether they are used with a classifier, and if
so, with which classifier they occur with. Table 3.3 gives a list of Makalero
classifiers.Only the first five of these classifiers, namely amu for humans, afur for
middle-sized round objects, hasa for flat objects, isu for small round objects, and
lafi for items of clothing, are actually in frequent use. These classifiers cover only a
part of the nominal inventory of Makalero. It is conspicuous that apart from the
human classifier, there appear to be no classifiers to go with larger objects, such as
houses, trees, cars, buffaloes, pigs, etc.83
83
  This may reflect a classification of nouns according to degrees of individuation. Hypothetically, for
Makalero speakers, nouns designating large objects such as the above-mentioned houses, trees, cars, and
buffaloes are per se individuated enough and need no classifier, while smaller objects such as eggs, sheets
of paper or teeth are seen to be more “mass-like” and need to be specifically individuated by a classifier.
[+HUM] nouns appear to defy this hypothesis in that they regularly occur with a classifier; however,
§ 3.1.3.2 (p. 115) shows that they have a special status in several respects. It does not appear absurd that
individuation is perceived as appropriate (though not necessary) for humans.

actual counting, such as in (62). The classifier and the numeral stand in the modifier
position of the noun phrase (§ 4.3, p. 279), with the numeral following the classifier.
Note that classifiers are nominal, while numerals are analysed as a subtype of verbs
(§ 3.2.3.8, p. 171); the relative ordering of classifiers and numerals in Makalero thus
conforms to the general verb-final word order.","[145, 146]"

7.2.3 Other adverbial clauses
Any clause may be used in the same way as the adverbial predicates discussed in the
previous paragraphs to provide circumstantial information modifying another clause.
The whole forms a sentence unit. (56) and (57) show two such cases; in (56) a
clause involving a time-of-day predicate with a fixed subject (§ 3.2.3.5, p. 164)
provides the temporal anchoring of the following clause. In (57), it is kamunei tuku
ru resi-loloi ‘tomorrow at 12 o’clock’, a free combination of elements. Both of these
indications of time are fully clausal and can make up utterances of their own.(56)     … mu’a kamu na’u tepa                 filem tifi-mutu’...
              ground night   just     constant movie    TV-inside=LNK1

         ‘… the two of us go tomorrow at 12 o’clock...’                        (120-127)Such non-lexicalised adverbial clauses may be placed in the left-detached position
(§ 7.6.1.1, p. 430), in which case they are marked with the complementiser (§ 3.6.2,
p. 265). Alternatively, they may be constructed as separate clauses in either
paratactic linkage or with clause-linking clitics (§ 3.5.3.1, p. 250). An example, with
unmarked linkage, is given in (58).

regular intervals of time. (59) gives such an example. Similar repetition of phrases is
found with NPs (§ 4.6, p. 316).(59)   … mu’a.kamu.mu’a.kamu ani huma=ni ani la’a=ni                     ako-ini.

7.2.4 Epistemic modality
The semantic domain of epistemic modality is largely carried by only one adverbial
predicate, tone’, which is glossed in the present work as ‘perhaps’. It covers a wide
range of meanings, ranging from highly uncertain predications to near certainty. (60)
and (61) illustrate the opposite ends of this scale.","[444, 445]"

with translations for =konai as given so far, this sentence does not tie in with the
meaning proposed here for =konai, which links a first clause, expressing a cause,
474                                     CHAPTER 8
and a second clause, expressing a consequence of the first clause. In (78), however,
the fact that people might come and look for the Makalero language is not the cause
of them wanting to learn a new language. Rather, the reverse order would be logical,
namely that people’s desire to learn a new language causes them to come and look
for Makalero. To date, only three such ‘reversed’ examples have been found. As
such, this phenomenon can be considered marginal for the time being, though future
research might shed more light on it.","[498, 499]"

particular sentences, and the subject is additionally marked with =ini. Examples as
(25) below, where a third person nominal agent acts upon a first person singular
patient, show that not only non-human referents and indefinite expressions are
understood to be unlikely agents, but, given the right context, also a human agent
such as asi-upa ‘my father’. Obviously, the first person singular pronoun, which
expresses the undergoer in (25), is an even better agent than an NP with a human
referent for Makalero speakers; consequently, the latter has to be marked to show
that it acts on the first person pronoun rather than vice versa.(25)    ... asi-upa=ni                ani mei ira teuh...

=ini is the single most common phrase-level clitic. It is found both on NPs and on
clauses, though it is functionally quite different, depending on the phrase level it is
used on. § 3.5.2.5.1 (p. 248) briefly describes =ini on NP-level, while § 3.5.2.5.2
(p. 249) treats the clitic on clause level. In either case, if cliticised to a vowel-final
248                                        CHAPTER 3
element, =ini commonly loses its first vowel, being realised as =ni (see e.g. (439)
below). In rapid speech, the final vowel may be elided as well, as a result of which
the clitic may be realised only as [n].3.5.2.5.1 =ini on NP-level
The principle function of the clitic =ini on an NP is the marking of that NP’s
referent as contrasting with another possible referent. A typical example is given in
(439).(439)    … amuni ki=rial=ee                   so’ot=ini dame=na’a=po ini=ni
             person      ATTR=many.HUM=DEF want=LNK1 peace=INT=ADVR 1pe=CTR         nomo so’ot...
         NEG      want
         ‘… many people want to make peace, but we don’t want that…’ (81-12)A more detailed description of =ini’s use as a contrastive marker follows in
§ 9.2.3.1 (p. 501).
From a contrastive marker which can be found on NPs in both subject and object
function, =ini appears to be evolving into a subject marker. Concretely, it is found
as a subject marker in three types of context; the first involves long NPs which may
be considered hard to process. In such a case, =ini marks the end of the subject NP
and indicates that the verb phrase follows. (440) gives such an example. In the
second instance, =ini is used when the order of subject and object is reversed, as in
(441). In such a sentence, =ini is vital for a correct understanding of grammatical
roles. Finally, =ini marks untypical subjects (i.e. subjects that are low on the topic-
worthiness hierarchy) such as the indefinite NP in (442). See § 6.2.1 (p. 389) for
more details.","[272, 273]"

4.1 The head
The head of the NP is prototypically a noun, a nominal compound, or a personal
pronoun. § 3.1 (p. 99) and § 3.3.1.1 (p. 218) give information concerning the classes
of nouns and pronouns in general. Nominal compounds are discussed in § 4.1.1
(p. 276). (2) above exemplifies an NP with a nominal head.
A head is defined as such by the fact that it is the locus of such nominal suffixes as
the plural markers -laa and -raa (§ 3.3.3.2, p. 236), shown in (3) and (4) as well as
the honorific suffic -uai (§ 3.3.3.3, p. 238).(3)     [[ni]POSS-[nana]HEAD-raa [meih] MOD]NP=ee

274                                         CHAPTER 4
Furthermore, the presence of a head is a prerequisite for the expression of a
possessor phrase (§ 4.2, p. 277). However, as shown by the schematic representation
of the NP in (1), where it is bracketed, the head is not an obligatory part of the NP.

(see § 3.3.2.1, p. 232) and ho’o ‘some’ (see § 3.3.2.2, p. 233), respectively.(7)      ... ani pada=ni      misa=ni        [[uere]DET]NP ko-horu...

such NPs as (7) and (8) cannot under any circumstances appear with a modifier.
Not only nouns, but also verbs can function as NP heads. This property of Makalero
is a major reason for the difficulty to classify lexemes into such lexical categories as
nouns and verbs, as discussed in § 3 (p. 97). (9) shows an example of a prototypical
verb heading an NP: the function of the complement-verb complex isi-ne’et ‘think
(of)’ as a noun phrase head is unmistakable through the fact that it is preceded by the
first person possessive pronoun asi- (§ 3.3.1.1.3, p. 225); a possessive is necessarily
the first element of an NP. For comparison, (10) shows isi-ne’et ‘think (of)’ in its
prototypical verbal function.(9)      … [[asi]POSS-[isi-ne’et]HEAD]NP ni’isi               ti’ir.

rau ‘good’: In (11), it is the head of a complex NP with a preposed possessor. The
whole of this NP is an argument of the following verb asu ‘for’, and is cross-
referenced on it with the k-prefix (see § 5.2.2.6.3, p. 349). On the other hand, in
(12), rau is the main predicate in its prototypical verbal function.

also be used as NP heads. In all of the examples below, the complex NP heads are in
square brackets for ease of reading. A relatively straightforward case is shown in
(13), where a full VP with the verb -horu ‘with’ and the third person object prefix
k(o)- functions as the NP head. (14) gives a similar case, where the verb phrase
which heads the NP includes the aspectual adverbial hau ‘all’. Finally, in (15), a
multi-clausal unit consisting of two clauses (the first headed by the light verb mei
‘take’, the second by the complement-verb complex isi-saka ‘search in’), takes the
function of the NP head.(13)     … [[papa         uere   ki]POSS-[ko-horu]HEAD]NP ue’.

         ‘Finding work in the city is not that easy.’                       (elic472)In summary, a variety of constituents can fill the head position of an NP, starting
from simple nouns in the prototypical case, to verbs, VPs and even full sentences.
Especially with internally complex noun phrase heads of a different lexical category,
such as the VP in (14) and the sentence in (15), some formal marking of the function
of those constituents as noun phrase heads is necessary. That is, the position and
function of a given constituent within the NP must be marked through the presence
of an item that is clearly associated with a noun phrase, generally a possessor phrase
or a determiner. In (13) and (14), these are the preceding possessor phrases (but also
the contrastive marker =ini in (14), which separates the constituent it follows from
the rest of the clause, see § 9.2.3.1, p. 501), while in (15), it is the demonstrative ere,
which follows the clausal head.
276                                            CHAPTER 4
 4.1.1 Nominal compounds
Makalero nominal compounds consist of two simple nouns which form one nominal
head together. The head of the compound follows the determining noun; hence a
Makalero nominal compound looks much like an English one. An example is
‘flower pot’, where ‘pot’ is the head and ‘flower’ provides more information, in the
present case its purpose or use, concerning that head noun. Nominal compounds in
Makalero are clearly distinct from an NP with a nominal head and a noun in the
following modifier slot (see § 4.3.1, p. 280), in which the order of the head noun and
the determining noun is inverted. Both structurs, however, are formally a sequence
of two nouns directly following one another.
Nominal compounds in Makalero fall into two semantic types; in the first of these,
the two nouns are in a part-whole relationship, whereas in the second, the
determining noun specifies a purpose, material, or some other association of the
head noun with the preceding determining noun.
A few examples of the first type of Makalero compounds, showing a part-whole
relationship between the two constituent nouns, are given in (16). All of these
compounds could be paraphrased as possessive constructions, such as pai ki-seur or
mu’u ki-fasu, corresponding to ‘pig’s meat’ and ‘banana’s peel’, respectively. 153(16)      pai-seur ‘pork’                             pai ‘pig’ + seur ‘meat’
          mu’u-fasu ‘banana peel’                     mu’u ‘banana’ + fasu ‘skin, peel’
          lopu-aihaa ‘(main) door’                    lopu ‘house’ + aihaa ‘door’
          meti-ualir ‘beach’                          meti ‘sea’ + ualir ‘edge’A noticeable subgroup of such compounds are body parts, of which a few examples
are given in (17).(17)      tana-raka ‘finger’                          tana ‘hand / arm’ + raka ‘finger / toe’
          ia-raka ‘toe’                               ia ‘foot / leg’ + raka ‘finger / toe’
          ia-lefen ‘sole’                             ia ‘foot / leg’ + lefen ‘palm’
          ina-fasu ‘eyelid’                           ina ‘eye’ + fasu ‘skin’The second type of compounds, where the determining noun specifies purpose,
material or the like of the head noun, is illustrated in (18). In uatu-teru ‘parasol’, the
first noun specifies the type of the shelter, namely one from the sun and similarly, in
ira-tu’il ‘water bucket’, the purpose of the container is to hold water. Finally, ira
‘water’ in ira-fereh ‘grass growing in water’ specifies a locative association of fereh
‘k.o. grass’ with ira ‘water’.","[298, 299, 300, 301]"
"
4.2 The possessive phrase
The schematic representation of the NP in (1) above shows that the possessive
phrase is the only dependent within the noun phrase to precede the head. Though
this appears to be at odds with the otherwise head-initial structure of the NP, it does
conform to one of the features identified as Papuan in Klamer et al.’s (2008: 95)
East Nusantara linguistic area, namely “possessor-possessum order in adnominal
possession”.
278                                         CHAPTER 4
In the most straightforward case, the possessor is expressed by means of a
possessive pronoun. (22) and (23) give examples of such possessive constructions.
For a more detailed discussion of possessive pronouns, see § 3.3.1.1.3 (p. 225).","[302, 303]"

7.6.3 Summary
Summarising the results gained from § 6 (p. 383) and § 7 (p. 401) so far, the unit
‘sentence’ in Makalero may be represented as in (112) and (113). In order to keep
these schemas simple, both (112) and (113) show monoclausal sentences. It is an
important property of the sentence, however, that it can be made up of two or more
clauses, which may or may not be linked by a conjunction.",[459]

This thesis is based on a corpus gathered during two fieldwork periods in East
Timor. Funding for these trips was provided by the Leiden University Centre for
Linguistics (LUCL), the Leiden University Fund (LUF) as well as the Swiss Society
for Endangered Languages (SGfbS).
Acknowledgements
The process leading to this thesis began when, during my MA studies in Zurich, my
then supervisor Dr. Philippe Maurer introduced me to a Timorese student, Eduardo
da Costa Guterres. His native tongue, Makasae, ended up being the topic of my MA
thesis. Eduardo’s commitment and enthusiasm convinced me that working in East
Timor would be a worthwhile and rewarding thing to do.
Dr. Aone van Engelenhoven, the present thesis’ supervisor, was also involved in this
endeavour from very early on – it was him who first made me aware of the
possibility of pursuing my doctorate in Leiden. He then accompanied me on my first
trip to East Timor, which would have been much much more daunting without him,
and I am immensely grateful to him. Also, he was always willing to read and discuss
any preliminary analyses and findings. None of this would have been possible, of
course, without the consent of Prof. Maarten Mous to act as my promotor. He was
very supportive and despite all his other duties always took the time to read parts of
my dissertation when I asked him to. It was a pleasure to work with him.
I also owe thanks to all other members of LUCL, who helped making my time in
Leiden a unique and interesting experience. An honorary mention goes to Camelia
Constantinescu, Allison Kirk, Jessie Nixon, Stanly Oomen, Kateřina Součková and
Rebecca Voll, who provided good company, a lot of fun and, thankfully,
conversation topics other than linguistics. I also very much appreciate Stanly’s
willingness to translate the Dutch summary of this thesis. Antoinette Schapper
proved to be a pleasure to have as an office mate. Another noteworthy member of
LUCL is Felix Rau, whose contribution to this thesis is so substantial that he has a
special paragraph all to himself below.
In Iliomar, the main town of the Makalero-speaking area, I am immensely indebted
to Carolino Assunção and his wife Joana da Silva, who let me stay in their house.
Their warm welcome made me look forward to every successive period in Iliomar. I
am also very grateful to Joana’s extended family, who took good care of me and
provided me with a lot of data. Furthermore, I would like to express my heartfelt
thanks to the teachers of SD1 in Iliomar, which is right next to Carolino and Joana ’s
house. Like this, there were always people to talk to, and another large part of my
corpus comes from the school staff. I would also like to thank everyone else who
was willing to share their stories with me. I hope this work does them justice.
In Lospalos, thanks to Dr. Ruben Stoel, I met Mafalda Rosa, who became my main
informant and closest friend in Timor. Not only did she always make time for our
sessions next to her work as a teacher at the junior high school in Lospalos, but she
also took me sightseeing and even accompanied me to Dili to see me off at the
airport. Being introduced to her was a stroke of luck. I would also like to express my
gratitude to Falda’s cousins in Dili, who offered me hospitality during the time spent
in the capital for administrative reasons, and in particular to Eligio Pereira, who
brimmed over with enthusiasm for my work. Martinho da Costa Van’s help with
transcription and translation, and the time and effort he put into it, are also greatly
appreciated. My heartfelt thanks go to the owners of Toko 8 in Lospalos, Mateus Li
and Natalina Lim, who invited me to join their delicious meals on a regular basis.
Their tremendous generosity is fondly remembered! A special mention goes to
Fernanda de Jesus, who helped me find a place to stay in Lospalos and was great
company. Also, I would like to thank Ana Godinho and Maria Sacchetti of Médicos
do Mondo, who kindly let me use their facilities (including the generator), thus
providing me with a comfortable work environment, and the Timorese MdM staff,
who were always willing to help. Thanks also to both MdM and the UN for letting
me ride with them to Dili and Iliomar a number of times. Not having to take the bus,
which departs at an ungodly hour in the morning, allowed me to get some additional
hours of sleep, which I appreciated a lot.
I would also like to thank my host family in Medan, Jakarta and Bandung, whom I
visited on my way back from Timor. After several months of fieldwork, getting
pampered by them was phenomenal.
In Europe, I was able to make contact with the Makalero speakers Hélio Cabral and
Silvano de Oliveira, who were willing to answer my questions to them through
email. Their help was invaluable, particularly before my first trip to Timor. By
coincidence, I got in touch with Hélio’s younger brother Olávio Cabral later on, who
was at the time a student at the university of Porto (Portugal). He was always
available online to reply to any questions I had, and our chats in Makalero were a
memorable and fun experience. In 2008, courtesy of Dr. van Engelenhoven’s
Fataluku language project, I was able to go for a short trip to Portugal, where I had
the chance to meet Olávio in person – he proved to be just as good an informant in
direct interaction as electronically, and also great company. During the same trip, I
spent a number of days at the IICT (Instituto de Investigação Científica Tropical),
where Vítor Rosardo Marques took the time to show me around the data on
Timorese languages that are stored in the cellars of the archive. My visit there was
very interesting and I enjoyed the work.
I would like to thank Sarah Brunner and Jacquelyn Coutre for taking the time to
proofread parts of this thesis – their efforts are greatly appreciated! I am furthermore
very grateful to my father, who did another reading. Quite apart from this, his
continuing support and affection significantly contributed to the termination of this
project. Thanks also to Filippo Svalduz for patiently helping me with various tedious
layout problems in the final phase. And of course the acknowledgments wouldn’t be
complete without a mention of little Pangur, who definitely helped me get settled in
the Netherlands. Unfortunately, he didn’t really like it here and moved back to
Switzerland. My father deserves additional thanks for taking good care of him
during my absence.
Last but not least, Felix Rau was an enormous help to me. A large part of the
analyses put forward in this book is based on discussions with him. During the
occasional bout of panic he always managed to calm me down and convince me that
things weren’t so terribly bad, and actually really rather good. Felix is a major
reason for my time in Leiden to be a success, on all levels. Thank you so much!

 1. Introduction
The present book is a descriptive grammar of Makalero, one of the 16 national
languages of East Timor recognised as such in the country’s constitution. It is
spoken in the subdistrict of Iliomar, in the south-east of the country. The location of
East Timor in the context of insular South-East Asia is shown in Map 1.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26]"
"7.7.3.2.1 Hai rau ‘it is good’
Hai rau literally translates as ‘it is good / okay’. It is sometimes found preceding the
actual imperative VP. Note that where it cooccurs with an overtly expressed
addressee, it follows that addressee. Its function appears to be the softening of a
direct order. Examples are given in (132) and (133).
448                                           CHAPTER 7

              NSIT good go         sleep=INT little=after=after 1s   go   2s waken
         ‘… (please) go ahead and sleep, in a while I will come and wake you.’
                                                                      (120-014)(133)   ... hai      rau la’a!
               NSIT good move
         ‘… go!’                                                                (120-071)7.7.3.2.2 =te’e ‘after’
=te’e is actually a clause linker expressing completion of the action of the first
clause before the onset of the action of the following clause (§ 3.5.3.1.1.3, p. 252).
With imperatives, it attaches to a simple sentence (with no follow-up, as would be
expected of a clause linker). However, it can be read as implying a following action,
along the lines of ‘do x first, before you…’. The effect of the use of =te’e is similar
to that of hai rau, in that it softens the order and makes it more polite.","[472, 473]"
"
 8.3.5 Complement clause extensions to verbs of saying
and modal verbs
A problematic case for the classification of clause linkage types into either
coordinating or subordinating ones is presented by verbs of saying and modal verbs
(§ 3.2.3.10, p. 186) and their, for lack of a better term, complement clause
extensions. A common characteristic of all these constructions is that they can be
expressed in the form of a coordinative clause linkage either without a marker, or
using =ini, as shown in (110) and (111), respectively.(110)   … ei-dada=ni             ei asar=isi ei dadau [mei la’a ue’].
             2s-grandparent=CTR 2s send=LNK2 2s must     take   move V2DEM
         ‘… your grandfather sent you, so you have to take (them) there.’
                                                                      (120-156)(111)   Ani isit malaria uai=ni=oo         ani fatar=ini [la’a=ni     ata haka].
        1s    ill   malaria   CLS=LNK1=too 1s   force=LNK1 move=LNK1 fire search
        ‘Even when I had malaria, they forced me to go and find firewood.’
                                                                     (103-08)Syntactically, constructions such as those in (110) and (111) show little signs of
being in a hierarchical relationship. § 3.2.3.10.1.2 (p. 189) shows that such verbs as
fana ‘teach’, fuin ‘dare’, pada ‘order’ and der ‘reply’ allow for the expression of a
preverbal undergoer object alongside a postverbal complement clause extension.
This shows that the complement clause extension does not function as an argument
to the verb in question; if it did, such constructions would violate the maximal clause
template, which allows for the expression of two arguments at most in a clause (§ 6,
p. 383). § 3.6.2 (p. 265) speculates that such postverbal complement clause
extensions originate as regular arguments to a separate verb, reflected in today’s
quotative marker ain (§ 3.2.3.12.3, p. 205). The clausal complement would then
486                                      CHAPTER 8
have been the object argument to that verb of saying in the regular preverbal non-
subject argument position.
There is, however, one use of such constructions which does seem to indicate some
hierarchical relation between the two clauses involved. It involves polar questions
and the answers to them. As (112) shows, a reply to a polar question generally
repeats the VP of the question. The reply to a polar question involving a modal verb
and its complement clause extension in a coordinated construction, however, repeats
only the modal verb, as shown in (113).","[510, 511]"

 7.4 Verbs of saying and their complement clause
extensions
Verbs of saying and their complement clause extensions are found in multi-clause
sentences very much like those shown for modal verbs in § 7.3 (p. 421). In these
sentences, the complement clause extension follows the verb of saying, as
exemplified in (83) through (85).

(83) and (84), are possible. Table 7.6 summarises the patterns found with individual

         good
         ‘In whichever way he tries to get money, it does not work.’            (elic1051)In (274), the complement clause extension to hul ‘be able’ is linked to the main
clause with the help of the clause linker =ini (§ 3.5.2.5.2, p. 249). In the case of the
biclausal construction with fera ‘try’ in (276), no clause linker is used. In fact, it is
more common for the clausal complement to follow the modal verb without any
making, and of the four verbs in Table 3.33, only hul ‘be able’ and irau ‘not
allowed’ are sometimes used with the linker.
The use of the reduced form hu-, rather than the free form hul ‘be able’ in (275)
shows clearly that the construction in this sentence is a complement-verb complex
construction. The other verbs in this group do not have reduced forms. In their case,
only differences in constituent order show that two different construction types are
used. In the case of a multi-clause construction with a postverbal complement clause
extension, these modal verbs are followed by full clauses, while in a complement-
verb complex construction, they stand in between a verb and its semantic undergoer,
such as osan ‘money’ and nese-la’a ‘find’ in (277). By analogy to the construction
in (275), that in (27) can be analysed to involve a complement-verb complex. The
fact that the undergoer osan ‘money’ in (277) stands within the same clause as the
complement-verb complex fera-nese-la’a ‘try to find’ as a direct object to fera
suggests that the latter is a transitive verb (§ 3.2.3.1, p. 141). The same holds for the
other modal verbs (see also § 3.2.3.7, p. 169).
Within this group of modal verbs, the case of irau ‘not allowed’ is somewhat
uncertain. There are only very few examples that appear to indicate that irau ‘not
allowed’ can be used as a complement argument dependent from another verb; one
of them is (278), which involves the verb nilu ‘forget’. This verb is listed in
§ 3.2.3.1.2.2 (p. 146) as a verb which obligatorily has its complement position filled.
Irau is the only element that could possibly be analysed to stand in this position in
                                           LEXICAL CATEGORIES                                          195
(278). This construction parallels that found in the cases of hul ‘be able’ and fera
‘try’ in (275) and (277) above and is thus a plausible explanation for (278).(278)      … ni-lolo-ini        ere     irau-nilu=na’a...
                REFL-say-NML 2DEM not.allowed-forget=INT
           ‘… (we) are not allowed to forget our language...’                             (98-34)The construction of the object argument in the same clause as irau-nilu ‘not allowed
to forget’ indicates that irau, too, is a transitive verb, conflicting to some degree
with the evidence from sentences where irau is the main predicate (see § 3.2.3.7,
p. 169).115
A construction found in only one case, with fera ‘try’, shows the modal verb to be
used twice: In the first instance, it is used as a main verb with a following
complement clause extension, as bracketed in (279). It appears again as a verbal
complement within that complement clause.","[219, 220]"

6.7 Summary
Expressing Makalero clause structure in the terms proposed by Van Valin and
LaPolla’s Role and Reference Grammar is problematic in several respects. One
major difficulty is the fact that the VP-internal argument can be realised in two
distinct ways, namely either as an object or as a complement (§ 5.2, p. 319). These
two realisations are clearly distinct in their positions relative to both the clause
periphery and the aspect and negation operators. As a result, two separate schemes
(repeated in (64) and (65) from (3) and (4), respectively) are needed to represent the

Grammar has encountered a number of problems. A large part of these operators do
not work on clause level in Makalero, but on a higher level of organisation, the
sentence; consequently, they have been excluded from the present section, which
deals with phenomena on the clause level only. First and foremost among such
higher-level phenomena is modality, which can be expressed either as a separate
clause or as a complement (§ 7.3, p. 421), but also the epistemic modality part of the
status operator, which is always expressed as a separate clause. Another one,
illocutionary force, also operates on sentence level (§ 7.7, p. 435). This left only
aspect, (internal) negation, and the external negation part of the status operator to be
treated in the present chapter. In Van Valin and LaPolla’s analysis, these would be a
nuclear operator, a core operator, and a clause operator, respectively. My analysis of
the level of operation of these operators agrees with Van Valin and LaPolla’s only in
the case of the clausal negator nomohaka, while the ordering of aspect and negation
is inverted.
 7. The sentence
A consequence of the very rigid structure of the clause in Makalero (see § 6, p. 383)
is that a great many states of affairs, among them all including more than two
participants, cannot be expressed but in a multi-clause structure. Nevertheless, such
structures describe one event. These, I would like to maintain, form a unit of
different status than the clause chains making up utterances as discussed in § 8
(p. 453), and a term to designate such units that are intermediate between simple
clauses and utterances is needed. A frequently-used term for units larger than
clauses, but generally smaller than utterances, is ‘sentence’. However, a good,
universally valid definition of this concept is hard to come by in the literature (see
e.g. Matthews 1981, Crystal 1991). For instance, in Van Valin and LaPolla’s
massive 1997 work, it is very loosely defined as a “larger syntactic unit [than the
clause, JH], which may contain multiple clauses in complex sentences” (ibid: 29).
Since I make no use of the term ‘sentence’ otherwise, I adopt it in this study for a
unit intermediate between clause and utterance as described above. A sentence may
consist of either a single clause, or of more than one (mostly two) clauses which
pertain to the same extralinguistic event. As such, a sentence differs from an
utterance, which, if made up of more than one clause, describes separate events, but
can also consist of non-clausal units, such as phrases or interjections (see also Payne
1997: 378). For a more detailed discussion of the utterance, see § 8 (p. 453).
The term ‘sentence’ is in the present study mainly intended to capture the following
kinds of multi-clause structures: The first type involves structures which display a
mismatch between the semantic participant structure of a predicate and the rigid
frame provided by the syntactic clause template in Makalero. States of affairs which
involve more participants than there are syntactic slots in a clause cannot possibly be
expressed in single clauses. § 7.1 (p. 402) discusses such constructions. The second
type involves adverbial predicates, which, though fully clausal, are never found on
their own, but only in conjunction with other clauses. Generally, these clauses
express information pertaining to anchoring in time, aspectual properties of the
action, as well as mood (§ 7.2, p. 413). Similar notions may be expressed by such
adverbial clauses as briefly discussed in § 7.6.1.1 (p. 430).
Furthermore, the expression of (deontic) modality (§ 7.3, p. 421) generally involves
sentence units, in much the same way as constructions involving verbs of saying and
their complement clause extensions (§ 7.4, p. 425). Lastly, the conative with fera
‘try’ parallels the latter two types in many ways (§ 7.5, p. 427).
All of these sentence types can be found constituting relative sentences within a
noun phrase (§ 4.3.5, p. 295). This shows that the sentence as defined here is indeed
a syntactically relevant unit. The sentence unit is also used to account for the left-
dislocation of participants for the purpose of topicalisation or focalisation, which is
elaborated on in § 9.2.1 (p. 495). Formal evidence for the sentence’s validity as a
unit of analysis, such as the left-detached position involved in such constructions, is
discussed in § 7.6 (p. 427).
402                                                 CHAPTER 7
 7.1 Semantics / syntax mismatch
The most important reason to expess an event in the form of a multi-clausal sentence
is a mismatch between the semantic participant structure of the predicate involved
and the rigid syntactic frame dictated by the clause structure. Such cases include, on
the one hand, all states-of-affairs with more than two participants. (1) gives such an
instance: the verb fana ‘teach’ logically involves an agent, a recipient or undergoer,
and a theme. The clause structure as discussed in § 6 (p. 383), however, allows for
the expression of two participants at most. The first argument position is reserved
for the agent-subject. In the case of (1), this is the pronoun ini (1pe).181 The non-
subject argument position of the verb fana ‘teach’ in (1) is occupied by the recipient
ni-mata ere ‘our children’.182 There is no possibility to additionally fit the theme
uere (DEM.DIST) into the clause headed by fana ‘teach’; both its argument
positions are accounted or. Consequently, a separate clause is needed in order for the
theme to be expressed. For this purpose, the verb mei ‘take’ is used. Its sole function
in such clauses as (1) is to provide an open argument position in which to express
the supernumerary participant to the main verb fana ‘teach’. Mei could thus be
called a light verb (see also § 3.2.3.12.1, p. 203). The two clauses share the same
subject.(1)           … ini tone’ uere mei=ni                 ni’isi          ni-mata      ere      fana.
                  1pe perhaps 2DEM take=LNK1 simultaneous REFL-child 1DEM teach
              ‘… we will perhaps teach that to our children.’                                 (106-11)The two clauses in (1) are conjoined using the clause linker =ini (§ 3.5.2.5.2,
p. 249). (2), however, shows that this is optional. In fact, sentence units are among
the few contexts where unmarked clause linking can be found.(2)           … k-asu         ha’auein ho’o mei kini...
                  3:UND-for place          some take give.to.3
              ‘… give him some place...’                                                      (69-055)The most prototypical ditransitive verb, ‘give’, presents a somewhat special case in
that it is expressed in fused forms, which incorporate the recipient. § 7.1.1 (p. 406)
discusses the constructions found with it.
A second large group of sentence units which are due to a mismatch between
semantic and syntactic structures involve those where transitive verbs, which are
associated with an undergoer participant, are constructed with a verbal complement
expressing locative or manner information. As § 3.2.3.1.2 (p. 143) shows, basically
any verb can be combined with a complement expressing such circumstantial
information. Also, § 5.2.2.4 (p. 337) argues that such complements are treated like
verbal arguments in that they are possible fillers of the clause's non-subject
argument position. This fact is illustrated by a sentence like (3), in which a transitive
verb’s undergoer must be expressed with the light verb mei ‘take’ if that verb is
181
      Since it is common to both clauses in (1), the subject is expressed only once, sentence-initially.
182
      But see below for the mapping of semantic participants on syntactic positions.

combined with a VP complement. If that complement is removed, or its content
expressed as a separate clause rather than in the form of a complement, as in (4), the
undergoer can again be constructed as an argument of the transitive verb.","[424, 425, 426, 427, 428]"

   Its Makasae cognate is -kini, with the same syllables in reversed order. This might suggest that the form
is a compound of two elements, ki and ni. Another possible cognate is kina, the prenominal plural marker
for the noun moko ‘child’ in Fataluku. However, it is difficult to account for its prenominal position as
compared to the postnominal position of its putative Makalero and Makasae cognates.
82
   In Makasae, the possible cognate -kai appears to be used with personal names, too. There is no such
example in my Makalero database, although it was not specifically tested.

[-HUM] nouns are largely negatively defined; for instance, they are not commonly
marked for plural using the -laa suffix (§ 3.3.3.2, p. 236). While such cases can be
found in elicited sentences, as shown in example (57), they do not occur in any of
the recordings of spontaneous speech.","[143, 144]"

8.3.6 Coordinating and subordinating clause linkage
The clause linkage types discussed in § 8.1.1 (p. 457) through § 8.1.7 (p. 474)
exhibit no signs of syntactic dependence. Interestingly, however, combinations of
such coordinating linkers with linkers classified as subordinating in § 8.3.1 (p. 481)
can be found. An example is shown in (125), where the coordinating linker =ini
(§ 3.5.2.5, p. 247) is used on neok ‘lie’ to introduce that verb’s complement clause
                                        THE UTTERANCE                                       489
extension. Additionally, however, the subject of the complement clause extension is
cliticised with the indirect information marker =kini, which is classified in
§ 3.5.3.1.2 (p. 257) as a subordinating linker. For comparison, (126) shows a clause
linkage with the same verb with =ini only, which exhibits no sign of syntactic
subordination.(125)    ... ani neok=ini ani=kini la’a=ni            ufe’=ini             kooperasi

coordinative linkage between a verb of saying and its complement clause extension.
(127) and (128), both with the verb lolo ‘say’, illustrate this. In (127), the indirect
information marker =kini is cliticised directly to the verb of saying. In (128), it is the
purposive linker =taa. Again, a comparative example exemplifying a paratactic
linkage, which exhibits no sign of syntactic subordination, is shown in (129).(127)    … liurai aire’ lolo=kini haka-hau ini-horu tia=na’a.

         ‘… my cousin Conçal said that he wanted (that).’                       (101-130)Such constructions seem to indicate that the clause linkers that have been termed
coordinating do not imply any hierarchy between the clauses they link. However,
they are not positively marked as coordinating, but are also compatible with clearly
subordinating constructions.
 9. Discourse structure
The term ‘text’ is used in the present thesis to refer to a self-contained stretch of
speech larger than the utterance. The present corpus of recordings mostly consists of
monologues in the form of narratives or procedural texts (see § 1.8, p. 28), hence the
following discussion covers only a limited set of text types and registers. A large
part of the texts in the corpus can be stylistically defined through the presence of an
opening sentence and / or a closing sentence. In an opening sentence, such as (1), the
speaker announces the topic of his narrative (often using a non-canonical word
order, see § 9.2.1, p. 495), while he marks its end with a closing sentence such as
(2).","[513, 514, 515, 516]"

number of instances which suggest that the reverse order is possible. This possibility
is also found with the consequence marker =konai (§ 8.1.6, p. 471). (27) is an
example, with (28) showing the more frequent time-iconic way of expression. It is
not quite clear how to account for a case such as (27).",[486]

 4.3.2 Verbal modifiers
The modifier position of a noun phrase can also contain a verb. Most often, this will
be a stative verb describing the head, such as pere ‘big (SG)’ and putir ‘white’ in
(40) and (41), respectively. These types of verbal modifiers are the translational
equivalent of adnominal adjectives in English. The NPs in question are bracketed in
the examples.",[306]
"
2.5 The morpheme
A lexical morpheme in Makalero must meet the following formal requirements:1.) the minimum lexical morpheme must be bimoraic
2.) closed syllables are restricted to the morpheme-final position
3.) only one heavy syllable is allowed per morphemeThe following paragraphs discuss these requirements in detail.
76                                    CHAPTER 2
2.5.1 Bimoraicity
The minimum lexical morpheme must be at least bimoraic. The vast majority of
morphemes are disyllabic, consisting of two light syllables. Each of these syllables
weighs one mora; the total weight of the morpheme is, consequently, two morae.
Some examples of such morphemes are given in (37).(37)    hu.ri                               ‘release’
        ua.li                               ‘ear’
        da.kar                              ‘step’
        ru.kit                              ‘curly (hair)’The form of the prototypical Makalero morpheme is CVCV(C). The CVCV pattern
is a pervasive feature in the languages of Eastern Indonesia (see Klamer 2002: 5).
As such, the presence of words of the form CVCVC seems remarkable; § 2.5.4
(p. 80) on echo vowels, however, shows that in practice, closed syllables are
relatively rare and generally avoided.
The bimoraicity requirement also applies for monosyllabic lexical items; it has been
stated above (§ 2.2.3.2, p. 64) that such morphemes must be made up of a heavy
syllable with a complex nucleus. A morpheme with a diphthong nucleus conforms to
the bimoraicity requirement since its nucleus is complex and consists of two
elements, the vowel and the glide. Each of these components is assigned its own
mora. § 2.2.3 (p. 62) argues that long vowels are in most instances allophones of
short vowels rather than phonemes in their own right, on the ground of their
predictable occurrence. Hence it can be assumed that such morphemes as [du:r]
‘wake up’ and and [ni:] ‘mother’ are actually, on the phonemic level, /dur/ and /ni/.
On the phonetic level, in contrast, their nuclei are lengthened in order for them to
meet the bimoraicity requirement, as illustrated below.(38)         μ     μ                              μ        μ
                                 →
        /d    u        r/                    [d      u:        r]
        ‘wake up’                            ‘ibid.’             μ     μ                              μ        μ
                                 →
        /n    i/                             [n      i:]
        ‘mother’                             ‘ibid.’The bimoraicity requirement is strictly on the morpheme level and is not affected if
the morphemes in question are part of a larger phonological phrase. Thus, even with
suffixes and clitics, such lexical items as dur ‘wake up’ and ni ‘mother’ retain the
long vowel nucleus.
Apart from mono- and disyllabic items, there is also a number of trisyllabic lexical
morphemes, as exemplified in (39).

segmentable, being either derivations or compounds. However, in many cases, no
