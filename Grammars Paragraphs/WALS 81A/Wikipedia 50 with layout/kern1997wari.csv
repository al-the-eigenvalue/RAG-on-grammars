                                 0.4. COMP AND INFLIn Everett (1994), considerable space is spent railing against the notion of basic word
order. We thus avoid this term here as inaccurate both in its use of ‘basic’, as opposed to
pragmatically unmarked or syntactically underlying, and its use of ‘word’, as opposed to
constituent. The pragmatically unmarked constituent order in 'ON is vos. We do not here
consider underlying constituent order at all, aside from some brief and highly speculative
remarks in section 2.2 in the main body of the grammar. There are two basic
configurations in which vos can appear, however. The first configuration is what we call
‘simple sentences’, those in which v is the first constituent. These have the shape in (f)
(where SFP= sentence-final particle):
(f)    V VIC (NPOBJ1) (PP/NPOBJ2) (NPSUBJ) (SFP)The VIC in this configuration is almost always tensed. If it is not tensed, then tense may
appear nowhere else in the clause.
   The other configuration in which vos appears is the COMP (=complementizer) clause,
as in (g) (INFL=inflectional morpheme):
(g)   COMP INFL V VIC (NPOBJ1) (PP/NPOBJ2) (NPSUBJ) (SFP)Sentence-final particles express temporal notions and this label should thus be
straightforward and uncontroversial for all readers (assuming that they do not mind the
term ‘particle’). COMP and INFL, on the other hand, may not be so appealing to a
general readership, coming as they do from Government and Binding Theory (GB)
(Chomsky 1981,1986). Moreover, INFL itself is an outdated term in GB since at least
since Everett (1987), Pollock (1989), and Chomsky (1992) it has been assumed that what
was considered to be INFL, the head of an inflectional phrase (IP), should be instead
broken into the separate components of AGR (agreement) and T (tense). Nevertheless,
we believe that these two labels are useful mnemonic devices and that they serve better
than any others, barring detailed theoretical discussion, to express the function and syntax
of these morphemes/nodes in 'ON grammar.
   INFL expresses tense and realis/irrealis mood and agrees in gender with any material
in COMP, whether overt or covert (i.e. merely understood). Thus INFL is not exclusively
a tense/mood morpheme nor does it express the expected type of agreement with a major
grammatical relation, since it agrees with COMP, not with subject or object. Therefore,
we did not feel that it could be adequately labelled by either ‘tense’ or ‘(COMP)
agreement’. We thus stick with our label INFL here. Since such a preverbal
morpheme/clitic is extremely rare at best, no standard term will work as well as, certainly
no better than, INFL in our opinion. Thus readers may interpret our use of these terms as
                                             Wari'   8
either merely a label for a specific 'ON construction or as a GB-related claim about the
relationship between 'ON phrase structure to Universal Grammar (UG), as they wish.
    Two kinds of information appear in COMP: words which indicate moods other than
(ir)realis and question words. These thus correspond neatly to the core function predicted
of COMP in GB theory, aside from the fact that only one COMP word, the ‘third person
singular neuter’ form of the preposition, pain, serves exclusively to introduce subordinate
clauses. (For GB-oriented readers, we analyse the COMP word as occurring in the SPEC
of COMP position and INFL as, at the surface only, the head of COMP.)
    When a COMP appears, INFL is obligatory and the VICS may not be marked for
tense/mood. This is simply accounted for if we assume that tense/mood ((ir)realis mood)
must always appear in the second position of the sentence. Agreement between INFL and
COMP is also obligatory, an additional reason for INFL to immediately follow COMP in
some theoretical frameworks.
    The movement or appearance of subject or object in COMP occurs in left-
dislocation/clefted sentences, in relative clauses and in wh- (or information) questions.
An item may only appear in COMP if it is potentially referenceable on the VIC in the
sentence in question (i.e. according to the hierarchy of semantic roles above). Thus a
theme cannot be questioned, relativized, or left-dislocated if a goal NP is expressed. A
location cannot be moved to COMP if a benefactive is expressed, and so on.
Interestingly, however, there is an Anti-agreement Effect observed with fronted objects.
The VIC may not agree with an object moved to COMP. Subjects moved to COMP,
however, require agreement on the VIC, just as in the nonmoved case.
1
  Note that we are using these as grammatical features only. If we were using these as ‘real world’
semantic values, the results would come out wrong, since many nonhuman items in the real world
may be masculine. The three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, are simply our labels for
these feature combinations.

A complete discussion of the three major 'ON sentence types can be found in 1.1.1.4. The
three general classifications are simple, COMP and verbalized (direct speech type)
sentences. A general discussion of direct and indirect speech sentence types,
interrogatives and imperatives, however, follows in sections 1.1.1.1, 1.1.1.2 and 1.1.1.3.
In this section we distinguish sentences based on a combination of functional and formal
criteria. It is not our claim that the types we identify could not be reduced (or expanded),
merely that distinguishing them here gives the reader the clearest view of how different
communicative functions are accomplished via different forms.","[20, 21, 22]"
"                                    2.1.1.1.4. Prepositions
The single (inflected) preposition marks the theme/patient NP when a goal is present, and
marks oblique objects to the verb—see 1.2.1.2.2–4.

                                              2.1.1.1.5. Constituent order
Constituent order is useful (but not foolproof) in distinguishing subject, direct object and
indirect object (in each of which only third person may be overtly expressed). The basic
order of constituents in a transitive/ intransitive clause is verb, object (or object-like
argument), subject; in a ditransitive clause, it is verb, direct object, indirect object,
subject—see 1.2.1.2. However, as noted in section 1.2.1.2.6, order may vary, so
referencing of the grammatical relation on the VIC or NIC is a more reliable means for
distinguishing NP functions. Most clauses do not have overtly expressed subjects or
objects; they are simply expressed in the VICS. Many clauses have only one overtly
expressed constituent (subject or object), while both are expressed in the VIC, and in
these clauses, word order is not sufficient to determine whether the constituent is subject
or object, and ambiguity can result. The postverbal modifier pan, marking subject
emphasis, or the use of alternate VICS (i.e. passive or reciprocal mor-phemes) can help
disambiguate such structures—see 1.11.2.1.2 and 1.7. Sometimes ambiguity cannot be
avoided and can only be resolved by context.","[231, 232]"
"                                       Wari'
The first major study of any Chapakuran language makes an important contribution to the
database of linguistic theory, and is one of the most detailed descriptions ever published
of any Amazonian language. This study is especially timely as the Chapakuran languages
of Western Brazil and Eastern Bolivia are endangered, and less than 2,000 known
speakers of Wari' and its related dialects are left in existence.
   The authors offer a unique, comprehensive grammatical description of Wari', covering
areas such as syntax, negation, morphology, phonology, ideophone/interjection and
lexicon.
   This descriptive grammar will appeal to linguistic scholars and students alike.
   Daniel L.Everett is a specialist on a variety of Amazonian languages and is currently
Professor and Chair of the Department of Linguistics, University of Pittsburgh. Barbara
Kern, a native of California and missionary linguist belonging to New Tribes Mission,
has lived among the Wari' people for nearly 34 years and speaks their language fluently.

                              Editorial statementUntil quite recently, work on theoretical linguistics and work on language description
proceeded almost entirely in isolation from one another. Work on theoretical linguistics,
especially in syntax, concentrated primarily on English, and its results were felt to be
inapplicable to those interested in describing other languages. Work on describing
individual languages was almost deliberately isolationist, with the development of a
different framework and terminology for each language or language group, and no
feeding of the achievements of language description into linguistic theory. Within the last
few years, however, a major rapprochement has taken place between theoretical and
descriptive linguistics. In particular, the rise of language typology and the study of
language universals have produced a large number of theoreticians who require accurate,
well-formulated descriptive data from a wide range of languages, and have shown
descriptive linguists that they can both derive benefit from and contribute to the
development of linguistic theory. Even within generative syntax, long the bastion of
linguistic anglocentrism, there is an increased interest in the relation between syntactic
theory and a wide range of language types.
   For a really fruitful interaction between theoretical and descriptive linguistics, it is
essential that descriptions of different languages should be comparable. The
Questionnaire of the present series (originally published as Lingua, vol. 42 (1977), no. 1)
provides a framework for the description of a language that is (a) sufficiently
comprehensive to cover the major structures of any language that are likely to be of
theoretical interest; (b) sufficiently explicit to make cross-language comparisons a
feasible undertaking (in particular, through the detailed numbering key); and (c)
sufficiently flexible to encompass the range of variety that is found in human language.
The volumes that were published in the predecessor to the present series, the Lingua
Descriptive Studies (now available from Routledge), succeeded in bridging the gap
between theory and description: authors include both theoreticians who are also
interested in description and field-workers with an interest in theory.
   The aim of the Descriptive Grammars is thus to provide descriptions of a wide range
of languages according to the format set out in the Questionnaire. Each language will be
covered in a single volume. The first priority of the series is grammars of languages for
which detailed descriptions are not at present available. However, the series will also
encompass descriptions of better-known languages with the series framework providing
more detailed descriptions of such languages than are currently available (as with the
monographs on West Greenlandic and Kannada).

                                        PrefaceWari' ‘We!’ (1pincl emphatic pronoun) is the autodenomination of a tribe composed of
several subgroups, totalling approximately 1,800 people, who live along various
tributaries of the Pacaas Novos river and other affluents of the Mamore river in Western
Rondonia, Brazil, along the Bolivian border.1 The people is known most simply by the
name of the river, Pacaas Novos, although we shall not use that term here. The dialect
described in this grammar is of the 'Oro Nao' clan. We will use Wari' when referring to
the entire language or all the subgroups and will use 'Oro Nao' ('ON, lit. ‘the Bats’) when
referring to the specific dialect described in this grammar. Other subgroups of the Wari'
include 'Oro 'Eo ‘the Burpers’, 'Oro ‘At ‘the Bones’ 'Oro Jowin ‘the Jowin monkeys’,
'Oro Waram ‘the Waram Monkeys’, 'Oro Waram Xijein ‘the other waram monkeys’,
'Oro Mon ‘the Faeces’, and 'Oro Cao' Orowaji ‘the Eaters of Green Things’. Wari' is a
member of the Chapakuran (Txapacura) family, which also includes the 'Oro Win
(approximately forty speakers; not a dialect of Wari', in spite of its name), located at the
headwaters of the Pacaas Novos river, and the More, who live in eastern Bolivia. It is not
known how many More speakers there are. There do not appear to be any other languages
of this family still living. This grammar is the first detailed analysis of any Chapakuran
language.
    We realize that our study is incomplete in many respects and we expect to conduct
further research to be reported on in future studies. Nevertheless, our goal here is to
provide a solid introduction to the major features of 'ON grammar, pointing out where
relevant points of particular typological or theoretical interest, although for the most part
we have followed the series outline closely and have avoided theoretical discussions.
    A word about our joint authorship is in order. We would like to emphasize that this
grammar is um trabalho de quatro mãos, i.e. truly a jointly authored study. Our names
are listed alphabetically. Each of us has spent time considering every statement and
example on every page of this study. In so far as is possible, we agree on the entire
content. However, if there are errors remaining, each of us blames the other for not
catching them.
    On the other hand, DE would like to stress the fact that this grammar was only
possible due to BK’s 32 years of fieldwork and data-collection (copious field notes and
over 700 pages of text), as well as her fluency in the language. DE himself has only had a
few days of actual informant work on the language. In this sense BK is the primary
author.
    We would like to thank numerous people and organizations for their help in preparing
this grammar. We thank the editorial board of the Routledge Grammar Series for inviting
us to contribute this study. Without that impetus, we might have given up at points due to
the miles separating us. We would also like to thank the New Tribes Mission and the
Summer Institute of Linguistics for logistic and financial support at various phases of this
study. DE would like to thank the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Latin American
Studies, Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and Department of Linguistics for
their financial and moral support of his Amazonian research over the last several years
(as well as the National Science Foundation for a grant to study Arawan languages, from
which he borrowed a few weeks to complete this grammar before heading out to the
Banawa' village). We would also like to acknowledge here the pioneering work of all the
New Tribes missionaries who as a group have worked with the Wari' since the initial
contact in 1957, in particular Royal Taylor, whose collaboration in the study of Wari'
contributed much to the analysis of the language, and BK’s husband, Manfred, without
whose patience and steadfast support this work would never have become a reality. DE
would like to thank also Keren Everett for her support to him during the many weeks of
preparing the final version of the manuscript, when he was very poor company and
interested in talking about little but Wari'. We would also like to salute the work of
various chefes de posto of Brazil’s National Indian Foundation (the FUNAI) for their
dedication to the Wari' and other indigenous groups of Brazil. These people are often the
unsung heroes of efforts to help the Indians.
    Finally, but especially, we want to thank the Wari' themselves for their patient
teaching of their language, their warm acceptance and their hospitality. It is our hope that
at least part of the richness of this people’s language will emerge in the following pages.
We express our deepest hopes and prayers for their continued health and vitality as a
people.

  This autodenomination differs interestingly from subgroup names, such as 'Oro Nao', the name of
the subgroup whose dialect we are describing here, in that it lacks the collective word 'oro.
However, the Pacaas Novos people rejected our attempts to use the phrase 'Oro Wari' ‘all the
people’ as the autodenomination of the entire group, insisting that the correct term was simply
Wari'.

              An overview of 'Oro Nao' Grammar                                 0.0. INTRODUCTIONThe purpose of this introduction is to highlight certain features of 'Oro Nao' grammar that
we believe other linguists should find particularly interesting, just in case they are trying
to decide whether or not to read this grammar. It is not meant to serve as a stand-alone
introduction to Wari' or 'Oro Nao' but merely to draw attention to features of the grammar
covered in detail below.","[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14]"
"                                         1.2.1.2.4. Oblique object
When an oblique argument is the only object-like argument of a verb, it is usually
referenced by the object VIC as discussed above.
(198) a.              Tomi'                  'inain                      xim               ne.
                                             'ina -in

                      ‘I spoke last night.’
(198) b.             Com               pe                   'inain                     nahwarac.

                     ‘I sang in the jungle.’
                                1.2.1.2.5. Combinations of arguments
Although it is theoretically possible to have as many as four arguments to a verb, the VP
usually functions alone in the sentence. One argument is common, but adding a second is
uncommon. We have observed the following combinations:
   Direct object/subject

                                        1.2.1.2.6. Order of constituents
The occurrence of multiple overtly expressed constituents is uncommon, but the basic
order seems to be vos (201 a), and an indirect object occurs between the direct object and
the subject (201b).
(201) a.                Quep                  nain                                xirim                tarama'.

               ‘Topa' made Hatem a dress.’An oblique object may precede or follow the subject.
(202) a.      Pa'     to              nonon                      hwam          pain            com         'oro      wari'.

              ‘The people killed fish at the river.’

               ‘Moroxin laughed at us because of the can.’In contrast to an oblique object in the form of an NP, which may either precede or follow
the subject, an oblique object derived from a pain subordinate clause may only follow the
subject. It should be noted, however, that oblique objects derived from pain subordinate
clauses rarely occur with another argument.

           ‘The interior cavity where it is sat in eventually goes in.’ (describing the process of
           making a canoe)We stated above that the most frequent constituent word order of 'ON is vos. This
constituent order does not refer to the agreement affixes which form the VIC (where
subject VIC always precedes object VIC). Although the preferred constituent order is
object followed by subject, the subject occasionally precedes the object in sentences
where both constituents are overtly expressed, especially when there is no ambiguity as to
which element is the subject and which is the object. See 1.10, where the verbs ma' ‘to
exist’ and om ‘to not exist’ usually cause a subject-object order in sentences expressing
possession. In the examples below, (204a) shows the normal object-subject order, and
(204b) shows the subject-object order.

                  ‘Pacao' dropped the fish.’ (lit. ‘The fish fell from Pacao'.’)When both the subject and object (direct or oblique) are overtly expressed, and one of
them is an NP containing two nouns (possessed NP or two nouns in apposition to each
other), the other constituent can (though rarely does) occur between the constituents of
the NP. The examples in (205)–(209) were all taken from text.
   In (205) the subject tocwe ‘Brazil nut’ occurs between the two elements of the oblique
object, winacon ‘head(3sm)’ and Jimain ‘masculine name’:

            ‘The Brazil nut hit Jimain on the head.’In (206), the oblique object canoa ‘canoe’ occurs between the two elements of the
subject, pije' ‘child’ and Samuel ‘masculine name’:

             ‘The child Samuel sat in the canoe.’In (207), the oblique object macan' ‘dirt’ occurs between the two elements of the subject,
aracon ‘bones(3sm)’ and Jeju ‘Jesus’:

        ‘Jesus’ bones did not stay on the earth.’In (208), the subject wiri' ‘wasp’ occurs between the two elements of the direct object,
winacon ‘head(3sm)’ and 'Orowao' Xoc Waji ‘masculine name’:
(208)     Narom         pin                    ho'       nain              winacon              wiri'

          m:name
          ‘The wasps buzzed 'Orowao' Xoc Waji’s head.’Note, however, in (209), that the subject pacun ‘rock’ precedes the possessed NP object
xiricon wijam ‘house(3sm) non-Indian’, without separating its two elements, illustrating
that this interposition is not obligatory.
(209)   Je               ca                    to'   teren       nein     pacun       xiricon

                               1.2.1.2.7. Anti-agreement effects
There is an anti-agreement effect for moved objects but not subjects. Any object which
would normally be marked on the VIC is prohibited from being referenced on the VIC
when fronted to sentence-initial position, e.g. relative clauses, information questions and
clefted sentences. This happens whether the sentence is negative or positive.

The following types of verbal modification occur.
   1.2.1.3.1.1. Verbal modifiers The notion of simple adverbial modification is
expressed by verb compounding. What we call pre- and postverbal modifiers
immediately precede or follow a verb root, producing a compound verb. The
distinguishing characteristic of verbal modifiers is their inability to occur in a
noncompounded, simple verb. Some of them display a property of regular verbs: they
have singular (less intense) and plural (intense) forms—see 2.1.3.6.2.3. Pairs of
singular/plural modifiers are indicated by ‘/’. Listed below are the preverbal modifiers
that we have encountered:
'aji                            attachedly
'am/'aram                       finally; perhaps; for example; when
'amon / 'aramon                 diminutive
'iri'                           truly; gradually
jun                              suddenly
main                             eventually
mam'                             immediately
mon/momon                        slowly
tama'                            always
'u' um                           at dawn

xut xut                          suddenly (lit. ‘walk walk’)Examples (220) show the way some of these verbal modifiers function:

           ‘He is a mama’s boy.’ (lit. ‘He (says), “My attachedly mother”.’)Some of the verbal modifiers listed above also have other functions. Three are actually

‘night’.

position. We distinguish these by labelling as postverbal modifiers those morphemes
which may only occur in this position. It is common for monosyllabic postverbal
modifiers in this position to avoid stress. Verbs in this position can undergo some
semantic drift (see 2.2.3.1.2.1–2 on compounding for more details). Example (224)
illustrates a few verbs occurring in postverbal modification position.

marks stress:

"                                        1.1.1.4.1. Simple sentences
Simple sentences include declarative, imperative, and yes-no interrogative sentences.
They are distinguished from COMP and verbalized sentences by the following criteria:
1 No operator word occurs in COMP.
2 They have a simple verb structure, i.e. the verb is optionally preceded and/or followed
   by a verbal modifier, and the verb/modifier compound is then followed by one verbal
   inflectional clitic.
3 Tense VICS usually follow the verb. This is due to the fact that tense itself (with one
   exception) only appears once in the clause, in second position; see 2.1.8.2.5 and the
   discussion preceding the examples in (64) below.

             ‘The children fought each other.’As we have said, Tense VICS usually accompany the verb in simple sentences. However,
the use of a small class of verbal modifiers ('a/'ara ‘negative’, mao' ‘negative’, para
‘therefore’), one nonderived verb (win ‘to be the same’), another verb zero-derived from
a demonstrative (cain' ‘to be that (n.distal)’), and one type of sentence-final emphatic
particle (Ca'/ ma'/ne/pane 'ira and ca'/ma'/ne/pane quira) ‘emphatic particles’) requires
instead the use of Tenseless VICS (with no INFL morpheme), as shown in the sets of
examples in (58) to (63) below:
   (1) 'A/'ara and mao ‘negative’
   Note that the use of the double negative in example (58d) expresses a strong positive.

expressed.

    When used with Tense VICS, 'am and its plural/intensifier variant 'aram mean
‘finally’ (60a–b). When used with Tenseless VICS, they express the notion of ‘perhaps’
or ‘possibly’ (60c–d).

                               1.1.1.4.2. COMP sentences
COMP sentences are distinguished from simple and verbalized sentences by the
following criteria:
1 They have an overt expression in their sentence-initial position, or COMP, what we will
   refer to as ‘operator words’ or ‘COMP words’.
2 An INFL morpheme usually follows the operator word. This is because Tense must
   appear in second position of the sentence (with few exceptions, to be noted in the
   course of our discussion)—see 2.1.8.2.5.
3 Tenseless VICS usually follow the verb in the VP (there are exceptions to this, noted in
   the paragraph preceding (64) and the paragraph following (73)).
By ‘operator word’, we mean a word which sets the value of a particular logical
connective for the entire sentence, or which is interpreted logically as binding a variable
in the sentence. By ‘INFL’, we mean a preverbal word which gives information about
tense, mood and in some cases gender. That operator words are separate syntactic words,
and not prefixes, can be shown in information questions, where questioned NPS can be
placed between the operator word and INFL. Also, some operator words form
compounds with different nouns or demonstratives in preverbal positions, as shown in
some of the examples which follow ((68a), (73e–f), (74c), (82c–e)). This is also not
expected if these are prefixes. We analyse INFL as a separate morpheme, because the
language otherwise lacks prefixes, although nothing crucial for our descriptive task here
hinges on this.
   There are ten COMP words in 'ON that appear in matrix or embedded clauses, and
one, pain, that serves exclusively to introduce subordinate clauses. Some of these COMP
words also interact with certain pre-/post-verbal modifiers and verbs in order to express
different types of interrogation. These COMP words select for specific INFL morphemes
to accompany them, as discussed below. COMP words occur elsewhere in the language
in different word classes, as shown in Table 1.1, where we list each COMP word with its
basic meaning as well as the function it signals as a COMP word—see also 2.2.2.3.
‘Interrogation’ means question-word interrogation.
   Three operator words (mo, 'ac, and 'ane) can occur only with declarative intonation;
four (mon, mam, main and cain') can occur only with interrogative intonation (see,
however, 1.2.1.1, where mon, mam and main also appear with declarative intonation in
copular-type sentences); and four ma', 'om, je and pain) can occur with either declarative
or interrogative intonation. Table 1.2 illustrates this. When ma' occurs with interrogative
intonation, it asks a question-word question; when 'om and pain occur with interrogative
intonation, they ask a yes-no question; when je occurs

with interrogative intonation, the implication is a ‘why?’ or ‘why not?’ question, but the
speaker does not normally expect other than a yes or no answer.
   There are five INFL morphemes in 'ON. They appear in INFL following COMP in
COMP sentences: ca ‘neuter realis past/present’, co ‘masculine/ feminine realis
past/present’, ‘iri’ ‘realis past/present’, ta ‘realis future’, and xi ‘irrealis’. Since INFL
morphemes express tense/mood in COMP sentences (and elsewhere, in noun and relative
clauses), they may not co-occur with a Tense VIC, except as mentioned in the following
paragraph. See also 1.1.2.2 and 1.1.2.3 below. INFL morphemes indicate the gender of
the (overt or covert) word or phrase in COMP.
   While Tenseless VICS are usually the only VICS which appear in COMP sentences,
the Tense third person realis past/present VICS must occur when a masculine/feminine
subject is referenced in COMP (whether overt or covert; this does not necessarily hold for
relative clauses—see the discussion on relative clauses in 1.1.2.3, where it is shown that
in some cases, no VIC follows the verb. See also (64d) below). So, for example, a Tense
VIC is required when questioning a masculine/feminine subject, which always involves

which always involves a covert COMP (64c–d).

As can be seen in the examples above, object VICS are not permitted when the object is
questioned in COMP sentences. In fact, whenever an object NP is moved to the front of
the sentence, it may not be referenced on the VIC. However, subject VICS are always
required in COMP sentences. (The only exception we have noticed is Ma' xi mo cwa' ne?
‘Who will run?’ There is no Tense VIC in this example, and we have no other account
except to note that we believe it is an idiomatic construction.)

              (lit.) ‘Where are you going to it?’We now describe the use of each operator word, the INFL morpheme(s) which it selects,
and its meanings. The first example following the introduction of each operator word
illustrates the operator word in what we consider to be its basic function. The subsequent
examples illustrate its functions in COMP.
    (1) Ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’
    When ma' is followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past/ present’, it
signals interrogation and expresses the notion of ‘what?’, ‘why?’ or ‘how?’ Since the
questioned element is nonsubject, Tenseless VICS follow the verb. When ma' expresses
the notion of ‘why?’, it frequently employs the use of the preverbal modifier para
‘therefore’ and/or the verb mi' ‘give’ occurring in postverbal modifier position. Both of
these verbal modifiers are optional, but one or the other is usually used in ‘why?’
questions. The three sentences in (73b–d) are synonymous and have the same
distribution, so far as we can tell. Note the examples in (73e–f), where a noun follows
ma' to form a COMP phrase and asks specifically ‘What thing do you want?’ and ‘What
day will the chief come?’ (73a) shows ma' appearing in its nonderived form as a
demonstrative.

          ‘How did they get well?’ (lit. ‘How/why did they get cold, did their fevers go down?’)When ma' is followed by the INFL morpheme co ‘masculine/feminine realis
past/present’, it expresses the notion of ‘who?’ or ‘whom?’ When the questioned element
is masculine or feminine subject, only Tense third person realis past/present VICS can
follow the verb (74a); when the questioned element is nonsubject, only Tenseless VICS
can be used (first, second, or third person) (74b). Note the COMP phrase in (74c), asking

             ‘Where shall we work?’(5) cain' ‘that neuter distal’
    Cain' signals interrogation. It expresses the notion of ‘what?’ (as applied to a
proposition, e.g. the content of an utterance or thought), ‘when?’, ‘how?’, ‘how many?’
and ‘how long?’ Either of the INFL morphemes ca ‘neuter realis past present’ or xi
‘irrealis’ may be used, and since the questioned element is nonsubject, Tenseless VICS
are used. When cain' expresses the notion of ‘how?’, it frequently employs the use of the
verb 'ac ‘to travel’, occurring in postverbal modifier position (78d). When it expresses
the notion of ‘how many?’ or ‘how long?’, it employs the use of the verb ma' ‘to exist’
(78f–i). See 2.2.5, where we discuss the derivational process by which cain' is derived
from the demonstrative cain. See also the examples in (62), where cain' occurs as the
verb in a simple sentence. (78a) shows cain appearing as a demonstrative.

   When ‘om is followed by an INFL morpheme, it signals negation. It may be used with
declarative or interrogative intonation, in which case it asks a yes-no question. Either of
the INFL morphemes ca ‘neuter realis past present’, ta ‘realis future’, or xi ‘irrealis’ may
be used, and since the element referenced in COMP is nonsubject, Tenseless VICS are
used. See 1.4, where negation is described in detail. (79a) shows 'om appearing as a verb.

                          ‘Didn’t he go?’(7) 'ac ‘like’
   When 'ac is in COMP, it must be followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis
past/present’, it signals resemblance between two objects, and must always have
declarative intonation. Since 'ac references a nonsubject element, only Tenseless VICS
                                                 Syntax           51
may be used following the verb. An 'ac sentence is always embedded in a verbalized
sentence—see 1.1.1.4.3.3.6, where we describe verbalized comparative sentences in
detail. (80a) shows 'ac appearing as the leftmost member of a compound verb in what we
consider to be its basic use. Note that in (80a), unlike the examples which follow, a Tense
VIC follows the verb, there is no INFL, and the sentence is not embedded. Therefore we
analyse this 'ac as a verb rather than a COMP word.
(80) a.                         'Ac                     pana                   na.

                                ‘It is like a tree.’
(80) b.              'Ac        ca                                 mao     cama          na.

                     ‘It seems like she went?’(8) mo ‘conditional’
   The morpheme mo ‘conditional’ may be derived from mo ‘list presentation’. An
example of the latter is found in (81a). When mo appears in COMP, followed by an INFL
morpheme, it signals condition and must always have declarative intonation. It expresses
the notion of ‘if’. Either of the INFL morphemes ta ‘realis future’ or xi ‘irrealis’ may be
used, and since mo does not reference the subject, Tenseless VICS are used. See
1.1.2.4.2.5, where we discuss condition sentences in detail, and 1.1.1.4.3.3.1, where we
discuss condition sentences appearing in a verbalized sentence.

                     ‘If he would go.’(9) je ‘third person neuter emphatic pronoun’
   When je appears in COMP position, it may be used to express affirmation or
interrogation. When je is followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past present’
or ta ‘realis future’, it has declarative intonation and signals affirmation. When followed
by the INFL morpheme xi ‘irrealis’, it has interrogative intonation and is used to elicit an
agreement from the hearer. Since je does not reference the subject, it may only co-occur
with Tenseless VICS (as in (82b–e) below). When it is followed by ta or xi, it often
employs the use of the postverbal modifier qui' ‘coming this way’. Note the examples in
(82c–e), where a demonstrative pronoun follows je in COMP to form a COMP phrase;
note also the examples in (82g–h), where the gloss of the irrealis constructions is
affirmation (i.e. ‘So you should have talked to me’ and ‘He should not have gone’), but
the implication is that the speaker is asking the hearer for agreement. (82a) shows je
appearing in its nonderived form as an emphatic pronoun. As with all other cases above,
this illustrates what we consider to be its basic use. See also 1.11.2.1.3, on pseudoclefts
and other emphatic pronouns in COMP.

phenomenon may have nothing to do with je 'i ma'; there are other instances of INFL
deleting when the verb is reduplicated—see discussion and examples in 2.2.4.1.2. (83a)

   'Ane signals contraexpectation and must always have declarative intonation. It is not
followed by an INFL morpheme when the VP is headed by a nonderived verb. It is
followed by the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past/present’ when the VP is headed by
a verbalized noun. The sentence-final particle ne ‘recent past’ must always occur. (85a)
shows 'ane appearing as a verb, which we consider to be its basic use. (85b–c) illustrate
the use of 'ane as a COMP word, where it means ‘but’ or ‘because’. See 1.1.2.4.2.8,
where we discuss contraexpectives in detail.

   When pain is followed by an INFL morpheme, it signals subordination. The only
INFL morpheme that can follow pain is ca ‘neuter realis past/ present’. (86a) shows pain
in what we consider to be its basic function, used as a preposition followed by a
nonderived noun.

which it means ‘long ago’. Although the surface structure looks like a regular COMP
sentence, we question, however, whether it could really be described as such. In order to
express the notion of ‘long ago’, exaggerated emphasis must be applied to pain.

                                 1.1.1.4.3. Verbalized sentences
1.1.1.4.3.1. Introduction By ‘verbalized sentences’, we mean to refer to those sentences
in which the predicate is manifested by one of the derived predicate types described in
this section. Strictly speaking, of course, the verbalized sentence is only the derived
predicate itself. However, due to the range of functions peculiar to this construction type,
we will refer to the construction as a whole as a ‘verbalized sentence’, and hope that this
does not cause undue confusion for the reader. The derived predicate of verbalized
sentences can often be interpreted as an embedded speech, but not always. Verbalized
sentences fall into two groups. The first group includes direct speech, future tense
constructions, supposition, and purpose sentences. The distinguishing characteristic of
this group is that their derived predicates have the form of a quotation. The second group
includes conditional, desiderative, refusal, sequential and comparative sentences. These
differ from the first group in that either the embedded portion would not be a well-formed
sentence on its own, or the form of the construction as a whole is not that of a quotative
sentence.
   Verbalized sentences have one common denominator: the derived predicate is a
sentence that has been verbalized, that is, the entire embedded clause is treated
phonologically and morphosyntactically as a single verb. This verbalization of the
embedded clause is manifested by the following syntactic and phonological changes:
(a) The embedded clause occurs in the verb position of the matrix clause.
(b) The embedded verbalized sentence may undergo modification, inflection and
   compounding just like any other verb.
                                              Wari'   56
(c) Only the last syllable of the embedded sentence carries primary stress, just as the last
   syllable of a verb compound carries primary stress. (This would violate the normal
   stress rule that places primary stress on the final syllable of each word, were it not for
   the fact that the embedded sentence is now a single verb.)
The matrix clause of verbalized sentences is not marked in any special way. In general,
any of the Tense or Tenseless verbal inflectional clitics may be used. Restrictions on their
use, as well as the basic structure of each verbalized sentence type, are described below.
    1.1.1.4.3.2. Group I verbalized sentences The derived predicate of Group I
verbalized sentences is interpretable as a quotation. The derived predicates are italicized
in the examples in this section.
    1.1.1.4.3.2.1. Verbalized direct speech sentences: The verbal element of direct speech
sentences consists of the embedded sentence. The constituent order of the matrix clause
is:
    0 speech verb+Tense VICwhich marks the addressee and speaker as the object and subject of the sentence. The
order of the arguments and adjuncts of the matrix clause is the same as that of simple and
COMP sentences.

   1.1.1.4.3.2.2. Verbalized future tense constructions: The constituent order of the
derived predicate of verbalized future tense constructions is:
   v+1s/1pincl rf VIC+opt o/adjunctThe constituent order of the matrix clause of these sentences is:
                                                            Syntax         57
   rp/p or rf VIC+argumentsThe last syllable of the derived predicate, that is, the word preceding the realis
past/present or future verbal inflectional clitic, carries primary stress. The verbalized
future tense construction is preferred over the use of realis future verbal inflectional
clitics alone to express future tense.
    Only first person singular or plural inclusive realis future verbal inflectional clitics can
occur in the derived predicate (i.e. the embedded sentence) of verbalized future tense
constructions. Either realis past/ present or realis future verbal inflectional clitics can
occur in the matrix clause. The VIC in the matrix clause marks the subject of the future
tense construction as a whole, since the subject marked in the derived predicate and that
marked in the matrix clause are always coreferential (this contrasts with an indirect
speech interpretation (see 1.1.1.1), in which the subject of the derived predicate is always
coreferential with the object of the matrix clause). The subject NP must occur externally,
as illustrated below in (89).

indefinite objects, as per their behaviour in all clauses (see 1.2.5.2.4).

used to express mistaken speculation or expectation of the speaker. The constituent order
of the derived predicate of verbalized supposition sentences when third person is marked
on the embedded VIC is:
   v+3s/p rf VIC (+o or S NP)+postvm ma' ‘that:prox:hearer’Note that only a third person singular or plural VIC may occur in the embedded clause,
whether referring to third person or second person. The constituent order of the matrix
clause is:
   rp/p VIC+opt argumentsOnly realis past/present verbal inflectional clitics can be used in the matrix clause, and
only third person realis future VICS can be used in the derived predicate. The subject
marked in the derived predicate is always coreferential with the object marked in the
matrix clause.
    The embedded clause may contain an NP subject or an NP direct object but not both.
If an NP direct object appears in the embedded clause, then an NP subject may not appear
there—see (100g–h). A VIC within the embedded clause, referencing the subject, is
always obligatory however. This embedded VIC coreferences the object of the matrix
clause, whether it is overt or merely understood. Since the postverbal modifier ma'
belongs to the class of postverbal modifiers that do not carry stress when occurring in a
verb compound, the last syllable of the word preceding it carries primary stress—see
1.2.1.3.1.1.

                   ‘I thought Jimon hit (killed) his wife.’A verbalized supposition sentence may be negated by embedding a COMP negation
sentence into it. Consider the following examples (the verb is italicized in (101a), and the
derived predicate is italicized in (101b)):
   COMP negative sentence

                 ‘I didn’t think he went.’ (lit. ‘“He probably didn’t go”, I (thought) of him.’)The realis future INFL morpheme ta is obligatory in negative supposition sentences. In
both, therefore, just as in affirmative supposition sentences, only realis future may be
used in the derived predicate. The postverbal modifier ma' also must follow (be
compounded to) the derived predicate, just as in affirmative supposition sentences, and

1.1.1.4.3.3. Group II verbalized sentences The derived predicate of Group II verbalized
sentences differs from Group I verbalized sentences in that either it would not serve as a
well-formed sentence on its own, or the sentence in which it is embedded could not be
interpreted as a quotation. The derived predicates in the examples of this section are
italicized.
    1.1.1.4.3.3.1. Verbalized conditional sentences: The derived predicate of verbalized
conditional sentences consists of a COMP irrealis condition sentence illustrated in the
example in (81c) and discussed in 1.1.2.4.2.5. Only COMP condition sentences
containing the irrealis INFL morpheme xi appear in verbalized conditional sentences. The
constituent order of the embedded clause is:
    COMP xi condition clause+postvm xi' ‘dubitative’The matrix clause consists merely of the third person realis past/present VIC na. Since xi'
‘dubitative’ belongs to the class of postverbal modifiers that do not carry stress in a verb
compound, the word preceding xi' carries primary stress.

verbalized clause of verbalized desiderative sentences is:
   V+irr VIC+na ‘consent’and the constituent order of the matrix clause is:
   rp/p VIC+opt arguments/adjunctsOnly irrealis verbal inflectional clitics may be used in desiderative sentences. Primary
stress falls on the last syllable of the verbal element, that is, na ‘to consent’, not to be
confused with the third person singular realis past/present verbal inflectional clitic na.
The verb na forms a compound verb with the embedded verbalized clause (see 2.2.3).
The VIC in the formula above must be either first person singular or plural, or third
person singular or plural.

A verbalized desiderative sentence may also be negated by embedding a COMP negation
sentence in it. The irrealis INFL morpheme xi must be used. The negation sentence is
italicized and the derived predicate of the desiderative sentence is in brackets in the
following example.

of verbalized refusal sentences is:
and the constituent order of the matrix clause is:
Verbalized refusal sentences are similar to verbalized desiderative sentences, in that the
verb na ‘to consent’ forms a verb compound with their derived predicates. They differ,
however, in the verbal inflectional clitics that can be used in their derived predicates.
Desideratives use only irrealis VICS; refusals use only the second person singular realis
future VIC. The use of verbalized refusal sentences is very limited. We have only
recorded them embedded in a COMP negation sentence. We have not recorded any
examples with an NP object in the derived predicate. Moreover, since only second person
can be used as the subject of the derived predicate, they never have an NP subject. The
subject of the matrix clause is coreferential with the subject of the embedded clause.
Primary stress falls on the last syllable of the derived predicate, i.e. the verb na ‘to
consent’.

predicate of verbalized emphatic sentences is:
and the constituent order of the matrix clause is:
Verbalized emphatic sentences are similar to verbalized desiderative and refusal
sentences, in that they all employ the verb na ‘to consent’ in their derived predicates.
Verbalized emphatic sentences are distinguished from the other two by the obligatory use
of the demonstrative ma' in embedded clause, and the second person realis VIC, together
with the ‘dubitative’ particle in the matrix clause. The choice of the singular or plural
VIC in the matrix clause is determined by the number of persons addressed. This
construction could be loosely translated, in addition to the derived predicate, as ‘…and
you better believe it’, or ‘…you can say that again’. Primary stress falls on the verb na.
(See 1.1.2.4.2.1(2) for a complete discussion of the ‘dubitative’ particle xi'.)

predicate of verbalized sequential sentences is:
and the constituent order of the matrix clause is:
                                                    Syntax           69
The person of sequential sentence types is found in the Tenseless or reflexive verbal
inflectional clitics in the derived predicate (which has no tense/ mood marked in it); the
tense/mood of sequential sentences is found in the verbal inflectional clitic of the matrix
clause. Only third person singular Tense verbal inflectional clitics (na ‘realis
past/present’, tara ‘realis future’, or xira ‘irrealis’) may occur in the matrix clause. The
choice of 'ac ‘to travel’ or mao ‘to go (s)’ in the derived predicate seems to be based on
idiolectical preference.
   When there is an overt object or subject of the sentence, it usually follows the derived
predicate, just as the object or subject follows the verb of a simple sentence; however,
about 50 per cent of the time, the overt object may occur inside the derived predicate of
verbalized sequential sentences, in which case its last syllable carries primary stress. The
overt subject never occurs inside the derived predicate of verbalized sequential sentences.
Whether the overt object occurs inside or outside the derived predicate seems to be a
choice of stylistic preference. The use of the verbalized sequential sentence is a common
way to begin a narrative discourse. The derived predicate is italicized in the following
examples:

comparative sentences is the COMP comparison sentence described in 1.1.1.4.2 and
illustrated in the examples in (80). Unlike other COMP sentences, which can occur alone
as utterances, the COMP comparison sentence cannot occur alone as an utterance; it can
only be used when in its verbalized sentence form.
    The constituent order of the derived predicate of verbalized comparative sentences is:
COMP comparison sentence+pvm ma' ‘that:prox:hearer’ + opt arguments. The
constituent order of the matrix clause is:
The only verbal inflectional clitic that can occur in the matrix clause of verbalized
comparative sentences is the third person singular realis past/ present morpheme na. If
both an object and subject are expressed, the object NP may occur inside or outside of the
derived predicate, but the subject NP must occur outside. If no object NP is expressed,
the subject NP may occur inside the derived predicate. No NP can occur simultaneously
within the derived predicate and matrix clause. The derived predicate is italicized in the
following examples:

                                             constructions
The derived predicate of verbalized sentences may be embedded in various constructions,
including other verbalized sentences. Each embedded derived predicate is marked by
primary stress on its last syllable. However, when this is embedded into another derived
predicate, the primary stress then becomes secondary stress. Thus, primary stress on the
verb goes only on the final syllable of the least embedded predicate. In the following
examples, primary stress is shown by [1] and secondary stress is shown by [2]. The most
deeply embedded derived predicates are italicized, and the dominating derived predicate
or clause is in brackets. In (113b) and (113h), where there are three cases of embedding,
the surface predicate is in parentheses. Degree of embedding is signalled by, among other
things, the number of VICS. There is only one VIC per clause, therefore, two VICS
indicate one level of embedding, three indicate two levels of embedding, etc.

Subordinate clauses in 'ON consist of noun clauses, relative clauses, and verbal
modification (adverb) clauses. Some types of relative constructions are actually derived
nouns rather than subordinate clauses. See 2.2.1, where we discuss the similarity between
derived nouns and noun and relative clauses. There are no general markers that apply to
all types of subordination. See the following subsections for the markers of each type of
subordination.

                        2.2. DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY                                    2.2.1. Introduction
In this section, we deviate somewhat from the suggested outline in order to present more
effectively some of the highly unusual, perhaps unique, features of 'ON derivational
morphology. There are various derivational processes in the language, but two are worth
special mention here, since they are used to derive both nouns and verbs. These are zero-
derivation and compounding. Other derivational processes, e.g. iteration and suffixation,
are discussed in the final subsections of this section. The process of zero-derivation is of
particular interest to all theoretical and typological morphologists, because by this
process words may be derived from sentences. This requires us to allow the derivational
morphological component of 'ON grammar to apply to both the input and output of
sentence formation, something which some syntactic and morphological theories predict
to be impossible. Compounding provides additional evidence for this claim. We are going
to argue too that all words in 'ON are left-headed, whether derived by inflectional or
derivational processes.
    We have organized this section around derivational processes, rather than by the
categories which undergo these processes (e.g. N and V), since for the most part, the
processes described may apply to similar input categories to derive nouns or verbs
(although there are interesting differences in the nature of the input category).
                                      Morphology      347
                                  2.2.2. Zero-derivation
Zero-derivation is the process whereby words of one syntactic category are derived from
other syntactic categories without affixation (e.g. English He is the head of the
committee; He heads the committee; I will give you a permit; I will permit you). The only
phonological reflex of zero-derivation in ‘ON is the stress shift seen when the category
serving as input to the derivational process is larger than a single word. All words receive
primary stress on their final syllable, modulo certain stress-avoiding postverbal
modifying morphemes, regardless of how many words formed the input to the
derivational process (as in the case of sentences used as verbs). See 2.2.2.1.1 and 3.3.2
below on stress.","[359, 360]"
"                                 3.2.6.4. Vowel harmony
Different vowels in successive syllables of the same word are common, but the incidence
of identical vowels in successive syllables of the same word where /ſ/ is the medial
consonant is so high that we believe it warrants mentioning here. Two texts were
examined: one with 257 lines, the other with 218 lines, looking for different words
containing /ſ/. There were 57 such words in the larger text; 38 in the smaller. Exactly 73.7
per cent of these words in both texts contained identical vowels preceding and following
/ſ/, while 26.3 per cent of the words had different vowels. Admittedly, some of these
words were the result of partial reduplication (see 3.4.7 below), but the majority had
undergone no morphological processes to attain their phonological structure. A few
examples: xuruxut ‘walk (p)’, wereme ‘breathe’, taracop ‘corndrink’, 'orowaji ‘its
greenness’, piri’ ‘rise’, horop ‘bark species’, miri'om ‘ignore’, cucuruc ‘parakeet’,
cotere’ ‘our (incl) father’, caramaxicocon ‘their things’; xirao' ‘write’, tora' ‘choose’,
narima' ‘woman’, mirop ‘monkey species’, 'awori ‘ready’.
    Regressive assimilation within words (not across morpheme boundaries) occurs when
/e/ precedes a nasal or a plosive other than glottal plosive in a stressed syllable, by
causing the /e/s in preceding contiguous syllables to take on its phonetic characteristics.
This can ‘travel’ up to two syllables away (in our data), as in hwerehwet ‘appear’, where
/e/ before the plosive is pronounced as open [ε] and causes the normally closed /e/s of
hwere to be pronounced as [hwεrε]: [hwεrε'hwt]. Other examples: hexec [hε'tsεk] ‘to
dawn’, perepec [pεrε'pεk] ‘to glisten with oil’, and querec [kε'rεk] ‘to see’. Similarly, in
menem ‘your (s) possession’, /e/ before the nasal is pronounced as open [I], and it causes
                                                               Wari'         402
the normally closed /e/ of me to be pronounced as [mI]: [mI'nIm]. Other examples:
comerem                ‘thunder’ and teteren            ‘numb’.
    Vowel harmony operates from right-to-left within the word as follows: /Y/ causes /e/,
/i/ and /o/ to change to /Y/. Note the order of application of vowel harmony and
coalescence in (807d–e): the final vowel of the stem first coalesces with /Y/, and then
Harmony proceeds, changing the /i/ and /o/ in the stem to /Y/. For Harmony to spread, all
vowels must be the same height, see (807c).

Dissimilation (vowel disharmony/dissonance) occurs when successive syllables of a word
contain /i/. The last /i/ causes the preceding /i/s in the word to be pronounced as       .
When pronounced slowly and clearly, all the /i/s are pronounced as [i].

See 3.4.1.1, where we discuss consonant harmony that occurs across morpheme
boundaries.
   Another process which might be considered consonant harmony is where identical
syllables in a word are reduced to a lengthened consonant. This is just a fluctuation.","[414, 415, 416]"

In general, noun clauses are marked by the use of the INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis
past/present’ or 'iri' ‘realis past/present’ preceding the verb, and one of the Tenseless
verbal inflectional clitics, a nominal inflectional clitic, or the infinitival/participial marker
wa following the verb. Noun clauses appear as the object or subject of the superordinate
clause, and, in this function, they follow the VP of the superordinate clause. The noun
clauses are italicized in the following examples:

                                        1.1.2.2.6. Nonfinite noun clauses
As explained above, noun clauses in which a nominal inflectional clitic or the
infinitival/participial marker wa appear are nonfinite.
   1.1.2.2.6.1. Verbal categories in nonfinite clauses No verbal categories are lost in
nonfinite noun clauses in which the possessive marking nominal inflectional clitics occur.
The categories of person, number and gender are retained in the inflectional clitic marker
following the verb, and tense/ mood is retained in the INFL morpheme preceding it. The
verbal categories of person, number and gender are lost in nonfinite clauses in which the
infinitival/participial marker wa occurs, but tense/mood is retained in the INFL
morpheme preceding the verb.
   1.1.2.2.6.2. Nonfinite form of the verb The only difference between finite and
nonfinite verbs is the choice of the inflectional clitic following the verb. Thus, finite
verbs are made nonfinite by removing a Tenseless VIC following the verb, inserting in its
place a nominal inflectional clitic expressing possession, or the infinitival/participial
marker wa.

            ‘Speaking is not bitter.’1.1.2.2.6.3. Arguments in nonfinite clauses Arguments in a clause in which the
infinitival/participial marker wa appear are limited to objects; no subjects may occur.
Moreover, the object cannot appear in the wa clause itself, but must follow it. When a
subject follows such a nonfinite clause, it is the subject of the superordinate clause, not of
the noun clause. Thus, the infinitival/participial marker wa is also a way to express a
passive meaning. Note the alternate passive glosses of the examples in (120). The object
NPS in the following examples are italicized.

nonfinite clauses The form of arguments in nonfinite clauses is the same as that in finite
clauses. Verbal modification (i.e. pre- and postverbal modifiers) occurs in nonfinite
clauses, although less frequently than in finite clauses. The constituent order is the same
for nonfinite clauses as that for finite clauses, that is, the subject and/or object follows the
verb, in the order os.","[87, 88, 89, 90, 91]"
"                                      1.8.6. Correlative comparison
Correlative comparison is expressed by repetition and the juxtaposition of contrasting
sentences. The following example is a passage taken from a legend about the birth of the
sun. The top of the child’s head was the sun. As he grew, the sun produced more and
more light, until there was plenty of sunlight (‘the more he grew, the brighter it got’).
Note the use of repetition in the first three clauses, and particularly the repetitive use of
comparative sentences in the fourth to the seventh clauses (first the child’s growth, then
the sun’s growth), to express the progressive action of the steadily increasing growth and

There are two ways in which equative can be expressed (see also 2.1.4.4).
   (1) By the use of constructions employing the verb 'ac ‘like’ This can happen in four
ways.
   (i) 'Ac can occur as the leftmost member of a verb compound with a denominalized
verb.

expressing ‘and’-coordination—see 1.3.1.1.

Possession is expressed by the use of two verbs: ma' ‘to exist’, and 'om ‘to not exist’.
Although these verbs are similar to English have and have not, they differ in the
                                             Wari'   194
grammatical relations assigned to possessor and possessed NPS. In 'ON, the possessor is
expressed as an (oblique) object.

                ‘I have a house.’ (lit. ‘A house exists to me.’)
(345) b.    'Om                              nem                                 wom.

            ‘You do not have a dress.’ (lit. ‘A dress does not exist to you.’)When third person NP objects are overtly expressed in sentences in which ma' ‘to exist’
or 'om ‘to not exist’ appear as the verb, a deviation of the normal vos pattern of the
language usually occurs: the overtly expressed subject usually precedes the object. In the
following pairs of examples (a), with a vso order, is preferred to (b), which has a vos
order.
(346) a.      Ma'            non                               xirim             Xijam.

"                              2.1.8.3. Relative order of clitics
The relative order of postverbal clitics is first VIC, then the ‘rhetorical’ particle xin.
There are five sets of sentence-final particles, classified according to their sequence of
occurrence from left-to-right: (1) temporal particles, followed by (2) the emphatic
particles other than those in set 5, followed by (3) the referent particle quem, followed by
(4) the emphatic particle ta, followed by (5) the emphatic particles that have restricted
use (one set spoken by men, the other spoken by women).",[359]

Appositional constructions are quite common, especially when referring to people by
their names, in which case the kinship, or descriptive, term precedes the name.

                  1.2.5.2.11. Verbal modifiers used as nominal modifiers
Two words appear with nouns to express an adjectival meaning, which may also be used
as preverbal modifiers: 'iri' ‘truly’ and wara ‘already’ render the meanings of ‘real or
good’ and ‘old’ respectively; the verb jimao ‘different’ appears with only two nouns: it
renders a generic meaning to wari' ‘person’ and carawa ‘animal or thing’; and the verb
'om ‘to not exist’ occurs with a few nouns, but this is rare.

                                  heads and various modifiers
There are no constraints on combinations of modifiers. The tendency, however, is to not
overload a sentence, so it is rare that one would find more than three types of modifiers in
a single sentence. Thus, (263b) would be preferred to (263a).

There are no simple equivalents of ‘and’-, ‘but’- and ‘or’-coordination, but there are ways
to express this notion in the language. The constructions described here do not
exclusively express a coordination relationship however. They have other functions and
their form is simply 'exploited' to express coordination as well. Most of the examples in
this section are taken from text.                                                 1.3.1.1. ‘and’-coordination
There are two ways to accomplish the effect of ‘and’-coordination between clauses:
   (1) Juxtaposition: When two or more clauses are juxtaposed within a single sentence
or across sentence boundaries, ‘and’-coordination can be construed. The second and
following clauses are often of the verbalized sequential sentence type described in
1.1.1.4.3.3.5.

‘He did not talk at all, or we would have heard.’(2) The juxtaposition of mo conditional clauses, described in 1.1.2.4.2.5.

‘perhaps’ in each clause
   This renders a gloss of ‘either he will live or he will die’.

Win ‘like’ or ‘same’ coordinates in the same way that 'ane ‘different’ (267) and 'am
‘perhaps’ (270) coordinate: win occurs as the leftmost member of a compound with the
verb of the second clause, and Tenseless VICS must be used. See (271) and 1.1.2.4.2.7,
where equative verbal modification clauses are discussed and illustrated.

The only coordinating element which can be repeated for (nearly) all of the conjuncts is
an emphatic pronoun or third person form of the preposition when used to express ‘and’-
coordination of the nominal elements of the clause. In this case, all but the first element is
accompanied by a ‘coordinator’. It is possible for an emphatic pronoun to accompany the
first element, but this is rare. See (273) and (274) below.","[166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172]"

                        0.3. DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGYTypologists and theoreticians should find 'ON derivational morphology quite interesting
since sentences and phrases productively serve as input to zero-derivation and
compounding. These processes in fact provide interesting evidence for sentence
constituent structure. Zero-derivation takes a word, phrase or clause as input and returns a
single word as output, with no affixation. When the input is larger than a single
grammatical word it may be distinguished from the output prosodically since the output
will receive a single primary stress on its rightmost syllable. The stresses on the rightmost
syllable of each individual word of the input will surface as secondary stresses in the
output. Vowel harmony does not apply across words, even when they have been
compounded.
   There is a simple argument which shows that the output Cc zero-derivation of a verb
from a clause is a single word, viz., tense placement. As we remark later on in this
overview and in the main body of the grammar, tense must be the second constituent in
the clause when it occurs. But a tense VIC may follow an entire ‘verbalized’ clause,
strongly supporting our analysis of these structures as single words, i.e. verbs. Another
argument in favour of verbalization of entire clauses is that if they are not verbs they
would be the only examples of nonCOMP or nonverb-initial clauses in the language. This
result is therefore potentially significant for theories of the lexicon and its interface with
the syntax, as well as general typologies of morphological systems.
   Nouns can also be zero-derived from various combinations of morphemes, including
verbs, INFL+verb pieces, verb+VIC, entire clauses and nominalized clauses, providing
additional information on constituent structure.
   Compounding is another very interesting and highly productive derivational process in
'ON. In fact, nearly all multimorphemic verbs are derived via compounding (except for
zero-derived phrases), with reduplication accounting for the rest. That is, verbs are not
formed by simple affixation, nor by incorporation. Nouns occur in verbs only by zero-
derivation, often followed by compounding. This is interesting since regardless of the
morphemic complexity of 'ON verbs, they never undergo affixation (aside from
reduplication). In this sense, 'ON verbal morphology might be considered almost
exclusively derivational, since reduplication itself appears largely, if not completely,
derivational in its meaning, although this cannot be asserted categorically due to the fact
that the output of reduplication semantically is often aspectual. On the other hand,
aspectual morphology is not easily classifiable in terms of the derivational-inflectional
split. If we consider it inflectional, then it is the only case of inflectional verb
morphology. If we consider aspectual change derivational, then 'ON verbs have no
inflectional morphology at all, except for suppletive plural/aspectual forms. The only
                          An overview of 'oro nao' grammar      7
clear cases of inflectional morphology throughout 'ON grammar are then -xi' nouns, the
preposition, NICS, and VICS, and possibly the emphatic pronouns (if we consider each
of the different emphatic pronominal forms to be derived via suppletive inflection from a
single base—a questionable tactic).","[19, 20]"
"                  2.2.2.2.1. Zero-derivation from subsentential constituents
Nouns are unlike verbs in that they may not be formed from the zero-derivation of entire
sentences (i.e. COMP sentences). They may never include a COMP word. However,
zero-derivation of the following strings of material is possible.
   2.2.2.2.1.1. Zero-derivation from INFL+v The first string we will consider is the
INFL morpheme ca ‘neuter realis past/present’ and v:

                 ‘his death’Examples like (704d) involve two levels of zero-derivation. First, tarama' ‘man’
undergoes zero-derivation to form a verb, ‘to (be a) man’ or ‘to grow’. Next, it and ca
undergo zero-derivation to form a noun, to which is attached the NIC, nexi' ‘possessive-
1pincl’. The question which arises with regard to these examples is the nature of the
constituent formed by the INFL+verb unit which undergoes zero-derivation. It does not
seem possible to merely analyse the INFL morpheme as a prefix on the verb for two
important reasons. First, this would leave us with no account for the fact that ca must
precede the verb in order to guarantee that tense be the second constituent in the clause.
Second, this would fail to account for the fact that in normal matrix and subclauses, the
gender information on the INFL morpheme does not agree with the subject or object per
se, but with the content of the COMP node.
    Consider the first problem, i.e. the requirement that tense always appear as the second
constituent of the clause. If tense/mood were a verbal affix, it would be the second
constituent of the clause whenever its ‘host’, the v, followed overt COMP. But it would
be the first constituent whenever the verb appeared in initial position, whether or not it
was prefixed or suffixed to the verb, since notions like first or second constituent cannot
‘look through layers’. That is, the restriction cannot be ‘second morphological or
syntactic constituent’, it must be one or the other. In fact, for 'ON, it must be ‘second
syntactic constituent’ because when question phrases appear in COMP (see 1.1.1.4.2
above on information questions), the INFL morpheme may not intervene between them,
meaning that tense must be the second phrasal constituent (we assume that VICS are
generated outside the verb phrase in agreement phrases, AGRPS). As for the fact that
INFL agrees in gender with the material in COMP, we claim that this is because the
INFL morpheme heads the phrasal projection in which COMP occurs at surface structure
(i.e. it winds up in co position and information questions and other COMP material are in
the SPEC (=specifier) position of the COMP phrase (CP)). However, we shall not argue
here for these more abstract structures. Suffice it to say that the VICS never agree directly
with material in COMP, so that if INFL were a verbal prefix, it would be a very strange
one in that its gender is controlled by sentence-initial position rather than by standard
grammatical relations, e.g. subject and object.
    But if INFL is not a verbal prefix, what is it? We will claim that it is the head of its
own Tense Phrase (TP) and that the verb adjoins to it. It is this INFL+v adjunction
                                         Wari'    358
structure which then undergoes zero-derivation to form a noun. The VICS, heading as
they do separate phrasal constituents under our analysis (AGRPS) can be omitted from
the scope of the nominalization rule. For readers who have an aversion to such
terminology, the bottom line is that we must allow INFL+v to form a constituent which
excludes the VICS but which does not merely analyse INFL as a prefix on the verb.
    To head off a potential counteranalysis: we consider the forms in (704) above to be
derived from verbs plus INFL, rather than from subordinate clauses, because they do not
contain VICS or NP arguments. A possible objection to analysing these as derived nouns
(rather than phrases) might be raised on phonological grounds. In (705) below, the word-
initial glottal immediately following the INFL morpheme fails to delete. However, in the
formation of kinship terms, which are clearly used as individual nouns (see 2.2.2.2.1.5),
the glottal stop does delete in this same environment. However, we believe that kinship
terms are idiomatic, crystallized forms that have been reanalysed as single words, and
that they do not represent a productive word-formation process. Thus, they do not
prejudice our claims here.

determines which form of the third person NIC can be used; masculine NICS cannot be
used with words referring to women, and vice versa.

emph). On the other hand, if the derived verb is expressing an event or process ((708)–

from the above process and exclude the INFL morpheme while including the VIC. In
such examples, however, a nominal inflectional clitic cannot be added. In (718a) below,
the noun is zero-derived from a verb, mam toc ‘drink with’. In (718b), it is zero-derived
from the verb+VIC. (718c) shows that these cannot co-occur.
(718) a.           mam                               toc                             ne

                              ‘my drinking thing’Only Tenseless VICS may occur within the scope of zero-derivation. The prohibition,
illustrated in (718c), against adding NICS to a zero-derived nominal including a VIC can
be explained if we assume that the features of the VIC are still visible/syntactically
relevant after the zero-derivation process and that something like Marantz’s (1984)
prohibition against vacuous affixation (or Chomsky’s (1993) ‘economy’ principle) is in
effect. To sum up, then, zero-affixation may derive a noun from a verb+VIC, excluding
INFL, but (i) VICS must be Tenseless; and (ii) no NIC may be added.
    2.2.2.2.1.3. Zero-derivation of clauses with NP arguments We have a few examples
of nouns derived from clauses, in which the NP constituents of the clause are present
(object and/or subject). However, these differ from simple subordinate clause structures
in that the verb is usually iterated and there is no VIC.

2.2.2.2.1.4. Zero-derivation of wa ‘infinitive’ clauses To derive a nonpossessed noun, a
wa infinitival clause may undergo zero-derivation:
(720) a.                            mam                                 toc                         wa

                             ‘hunger’
(720) c.            ca                                       'an                    wa           tarama'

                    ‘marriage’ (for a woman)Example (720c) is interesting in that it shows an overt NP, tarama' ‘man’, within the
scope of zero-derivation. Recall from section 1.1.2.2.6.3 that wa has a passivization effect
in that it may not co-occur with an agent/actor NP but only with a theme NP. Another
example is:
(720) d.       ca                                      xin                          wa            pic

               ‘playing ball’ (lit. ‘a ball being played with’)Some of these might merely be analysed as infinitive clauses, but since they may also
function as nouns, we include them here as a potential example of zero-derivation.

                ‘I do not want to go.’We have two examples of derived nouns, in which the verb is iterated and the infinitival
marker wa is used. The example in (722a) is the name of a river in the region, well
known for its abundance of game birds. The base form in (722b) is a verb derived from a
-xi' noun. As a verb, it means ‘to be fleshy’. See 2.2.2.1, where we describe these
‘derived verbs’.

nouns from clauses containing both INFL and VICS. These seem to be opaque to native
speakers (i.e. they do not think of their individual parts); they undergo phonological
processes other zero-derived nouns fail to undergo; and the process no longer seems
productive, since only kinship terms are so derived. Co- kinship terms are formed in the
following way: the INFL morpheme co precedes the first person singular form of the
kinship term and a Tenseless active VIC follows it.
(723) a.              cowere' ‘our (incl) older sister’
(723) b.              co                                  we                            'iri'

our analysis, wherein we has first been verbalized via zero-derivation and then combined
with co and 'iri' to form a noun zero-derived from a clause (with a literal translation like
‘we older sister’). Examples (724a–d) illustrate co- kinship terms with the first person
plural inclusive Tenseless VIC, expressing the notion of possessive and occurring as a
suffix (stress falls on the last syllable of the VIC). Examples (724e–g) illustrate co-
kinship terms with second and third person Tenseless VICS expressing possessive and
occurring as a separate clitic (stress falls on the base form).

(725a), possessors (725b) and demonstratives (725c)); and (2) they also function
semantically as nouns. The Tenseless VICS that occur with co- kinship terms express the
notion of possessive.

                     ‘this younger sibling of his’The complete list of the basic forms of co- kinship terms, with their primary meanings is
as follows: te ‘my father or paternal uncle’; 'aji' ‘my older brother or maternal uncle’; we
‘my older sister or paternal aunt’; xa' ‘my younger sibling’; pa' ‘my maternal
grandmother’; jeo' ‘my paternal grandparent or maternal grandfather’; nowin ‘my sister’s
                                        Morphology        367
daughter (male ego)’; and nem ‘my brother-in-law (sister’s husband)’. The remaining
kinship terms take the form of -xi' nouns. There is one additional kinship term that neither
uses co-, nor could be described as a relative clause. It refers to the child of a man:
panxita' (child-1s) ‘my child’, panxima (child-2s) ‘your (s) child’, etc.
    Kinship term constituents form a tighter phonological unit than other nouns derived
from co. This can be seen in certain phonological changes which take place in the derived
form, in particular, asyllabification and glottal deletion. For example, when co precedes
'aji' ‘my older brother’, as in cwaji' ca ‘his older brother’, the word-initial glottal plosive
on 'aji'          is dropped, and co becomes a labialized dorso-velar plosive. This
phonological change does not occur anywhere else when co precedes a word beginning
with a glottal-vowel sequence, as shown in (726b).

derived kinship term than in nominalized sentences: (1) the word-initial glottal on 'iri'
‘1pincl’ and 'urut ‘1pexcl’, as well as word-final glottals where applicable, are dropped;
(2) vocalic harmony occurs between the root and suffix; and (3) primary stress is
transferred from the basic form of the kinship term to the last syllable of the VIC.

clause constituents cannot be questioned. In what follows, we illustrate the way
information from the various types of subordinate clauses can be questioned. But none of
these involves actual question-word formation. We have already seen that question words
may not remain in situ but that they must appear sentence-initial, i.e. in the COMP
position. If we assume that question words must appear in the matrix COMP but that
movement out of subordinate clauses is prohibited, we derive the fact that subordinate
clause constituents cannot be questioned. Let us now turn to consider how information
from subordinate clauses can be questioned.
   We begin first with verbalized or direct speech sentences.(i) Verbalized (direct speech type) sentences
Direct objects, indirect objects and subjects of verbalized (direct speech type) sentences
(supposition, direct speech and future tense), such as those found in (16), (17) and (18)
may be inquired about, as shown in (16) to (18). If the matrix clause is expressed, then
only the entire purpose clause may be questioned, as in (19).","[31, 32]"

               3.5. MORPHOPHONOLOGY (SUPRASEGMENTAL)Stress always occurs on the last (rightmost) syllable of the (grammatical) word, even if
that syllable is a suffix. Stress also falls on the last syllable of derived predicates in
verbalized sentences, as our analysis of these as single verbs predicts. In this sense, it
could be said that stress is constant under morphological processes.

                      Ideophones and Interjections                                     4.1. IDEOPHONESWe understand ideophones to be words which are partially onomatopoeic, may involve
reduplication, and (unlike merely onomatopoeic words) respect the general phonological
patterns of the language. Many verbs and nouns, especially names of animals, birds, fish
and some objects, are ideophones. In the case of verbs, they represent the sound produced
when the action takes place; in the case of nouns, they represent the sound the animal,
bird, fish, or object makes. These ideophones are treated formally like other nouns and
verbs. They may head NPS/VPS like any other noun or verb, being accompanied by
inflectional clitics, demonstratives and collective particles where applicable (the
preceding material is full of examples). In addition, many verbal ideophones undergo
regular reduplication processes to form plural, intense verbs.
   The (incomplete) list of verbal and nominal ideophones below was taken from the 'ON
dictionary:

Kinship terms are obligatorily possessed (although the first person singular possession
suffix of co- terms is covert). While the first person singular inflection of all kinship
terms is used in vocatives, the term of endearment, 'arain ‘lit. its bone’, is preferred when
addressing anyone whom ego calls ‘child’, ‘son’, or ‘daughter’. The first person singular
inflection of kinship terms appears as a derived verb, as shown below. See 2.2.2.1, where
we describe the first person singular inflections of nouns functioning as derived verbs.
(841)   Pa'                                                              mam?

        ‘Is she your grandmother?’ (‘Do you “grandmother” her?’ (lit. ‘(…say) “my grandmother”
        to her?’)
(841) b. Te                   non                          Xijam                'Orowao'.

         ‘Xijam is ‘Orowao'’s father.’ (‘'Orowao' “father’s” (lit. (says) “my father” to) Xijam.’)When talking about a relative, ego uses the first person singular inflection of the kinship
term. When two or more people talk about a person with whom they are related in the
same way, the first person plural inclusive inflection of the kinship term is used. This
includes siblings (both brothers and sisters): when talking about one of the sister’s
children, the term for female ego’s child (children) is used; when talking about one of the
brother’s children, the term for male ego’s child is used. When two people talk about a
mutual relative with whom they are not related in the same way, the term describing the
closest relationship to one of them is used. A husband and wife always refer to their child
(children) as pije' ‘child’ (hwijima' ‘children’) when talking to each other. In-laws also
use pije' and hwijima' when speaking to their wife’s/husband’s relatives about their child.
   Kinship terms belong to two word classes. The glosses of the terms listed below are
only their basic meaning. These terms also include broader relationships, crossing
generation levels—see the discussions and lists in 5.1.1.1–3.

   As with all -xi' nouns, the citation/base form for the paradigm is first person plural
inclusive. The first person singular inflection of six of the terms is suppletive; otherwise
they all inflect for possession like common -xi' nouns. The complete list of -xi' noun
kinship terms is shown below. The first person singular inflection is shown in parentheses
following each citation form. (Although we do not include ‘our (incl)’ in the gloss of
each term, it is part of the full translation of each of these terms.)

                             5.1.1.1–2. Sanguineal relationships
The purpose of this description is only to identify and define the kinship terminology, and
not to analyse the kinship system in depth. However, a brief discussion of how the system
works will help one to easily identify and define the terms. In the following guidelines,
‘actual generation level’ means the same genealogical rank or remove from a common
ancestor; and ‘theoretical generation level’ means two or more actual generation levels
that share kinship terms normally thought to be used on the same actual generation level.
   In the kinship charts and discussions in 5.1.1.1–3, the following abbreviations are
used: F ‘father’, M ‘mother’, B ‘brother’, Z ‘sister’, e ‘elder than ego’, y ‘younger than
ego’, s ‘son’, D ‘daughter’, c ‘child’, H ‘husband’, and w ‘wife’.
   Guidelines to be considered in order to identify and define the kinship terminology are
as follows:
1 Any ego considers father’s brother the same as father (te) and mother’s sister the same
   as mother (na'); therefore parallel cousins are the same as siblings, and any child of
   one whom ego’s father calls brother, or ego’s mother calls sister, is a sibling ('aji'
   ‘elder brother’, we ‘elder sister’, xa' ‘younger sibling’, xere ‘siblings’).
                                       Lexicon    427
2 The children of anyone whom male ego calls brother, or female ego calls sister, are
   ego’s children (panxita' ‘my child (male ego)’, cawiji ‘my son (female ego)’, caina
   ‘my daughter (female ego)’, humaju ‘my children (female ego)’).
3 A woman considers her brother ('aji'/xa') to be on the same theoretical generation level
   as her own children; therefore her children (ego) consider mother’s brother the same
   as elder brother ('aji', though see (4) below), and his children and grandchildren are
   ego’s children (panxita' ‘my child’, or panxica 'aji' ‘my elder brother’s child’) and
   grandchildren (wina ‘grandson’ and jina ‘granddaughter’) respectively. This principle
   also extends to the second ascending actual generation level: although mother’s
   mother’s brother is called jeo' ‘grandfather’, he is considered the same as ego’s
   brother (and thus on his same theoretical generation level); his children are considered
   ego’s children (panxita' ‘my child’, or panxica jeo' ‘my grandfather’s child’), and they
   call each other’s children’s children grandchildren.
4 Likewise, male ego considers his sister to be on a theoretical generation level above
   himself, proven by the fact that he considers her son (wixi) the same as his brother:
   their children are siblings, and they call each other’s children’s children grandchildren.
   The theoretical generation level breaks down, however, with male ego’s sister’s
   daughter (nowin): although she refers to him as ‘elder brother’, he calls her children
   grandchildren.
5 Any ego considers father’s sister the same as elder sister (we), and all of father’s
   sister’s direct line female descendants ad infinitum are the same as elder sister (we).
   This deviates from (2) above, where female ego’s sister’s children are also considered
   her own children.
6 As soon as father’s sister or any of her direct line female descendants (FZD, FZDD,
   FZDDD, etc.) has a son, he is considered the same as father (te) and occupies the same
   theoretical generation level as ego’s own father. The children of this “father” are ego’s
   siblings (and thus on his own theoretical generation level).
7 Anyone whom ego’s father calls father or mother, or ego’s mother calls father, is ego’s
   grandparent (jeo'); anyone whom ego’s mother calls mother, or ego’s father calls
   father’s sister (whether FZ, FZD, FZDD, FZDDD, etc.) is ego’s maternal grandmother
   pa').
8 Anyone whom ego’s child calls child is ego’s grandchild (wina, jina, wiji').
With this discussion as a background, we will now present each kinship term in order of
descendency (first grandparents, then parents, siblings, children, and grandchildren).
Although the Wari' people keep track of kinship up to the third theoretical ascending and
descending generation, their reasoning and terms are the same as for the second
theoretical ascending and descending generations, i.e. a parent of one whom ego calls
grandparent is also grandparent, and a child of one whom ego calls grandchild is also
grandchild, with one exception—while female ego’s ss and so is wiji, sss and SDS is
wina and SSD and SDD is jina—see the footnote on (21) in the list of relationships that
follows. The specific relationships listed below are exhaustive to the second actual
ascending and descending generations.

These relationships can also be expressed with a headless relative clause, illustrated in (845).

    Male ego can also refer to these relationships as panxita'.","[428, 429, 430, 431, 432, 433, 434, 435, 436, 437, 438, 439, 440, 441, 442, 443]"
"                                        0.2.2. Nouns
Nouns occur in argument and adjunct positions in the clause and trigger agreement on a
preceding preposition or verbal inflectional clitic (VIC). They may also trigger agreement
on a nominal inflectional clitic (NIC), following the possessor noun. Nouns trigger
agreement for person, number and gender. Since only nouns referring to humans may
trigger number agreement, number can be understood as a dependant of the feature
[+human]. Genders are feminine (for human females only), masculine (for human males
or certain animals, fish and bird species) and neuter (for most plants and inanimate
objects). This gives us the values and groups in Table 0.1, according to the grammatical
features [human] and [female]:
                    Table 0.1 Grammatical feature combinations
FEMININE                                    NONFEMININE
[+HUMAN, +FEMALE]                           [−FEMALE]=MASCULINE
                                            [−HUMAN]=NEUTER
This is an interesting gender distribution, since it does not involve simple conjunctions of
values for the feature pair [human] and [female]. Only human females are marked by
both features, producing the first division. In the second major division, nonfemale, the
features are opposed equipollently rather than privatively. Some nouns in the lexicon will
be marked [+ human, + female], others [−human], and still others merely [−female].1 In
mixed groups, masculine gender is always overridden:
(a)        masculine+feminine=feminine
(b)        masculine+neuter=neuterAs is seen in the main body of the grammar, neuter and feminine are never mixed, nor are
all three genders ever conjoined in a single NP.

    Thus, Chapacuran is one of the rare language families in the Amazon which manifests
grammatical gender distinctions, the other families being Arawan and Arawakan.
However, contra Greenberg (1987), these families are not related, at least they share no
obvious cognates and the presence of gender is hardly a sufficiently reliable criterion
alone to posit any genetic affiliation (see Everett 1996).
    Like many languages with rich agreement, in 'ON nouns usually only appear in
sentences to signal particular discourse functions and in isolated sentences to avoid
ambiguity. Otherwise, it is more common merely to reference participants in a
predication via VICS, NICS, or the inflected preposition wherever possible.
    (Nonpronominal) nouns are not themselves marked for case, number, person or
gender. These features are discernible via agreement and certain verbal modificational
forms. There are two broad classes of nouns, -xi' nouns (so-called because their citation
form ends in -xi' 1pincl) and non-xi' nouns. Kinship terms form a third (closed), minor
class. Both -xi' nouns and kinship terms are inalienably possessed. The non-xi' nouns for
the most part all have -xi' forms as well. The non-xi' forms are themselves subdivided
into nonpossessable and possessable nouns. Non-xi' forms which may not be possessed
(although if they have a -xi' form they may be possessed in that form) are body parts,
exclusively. Optionally possessable non-xi' forms can be marked as possessed via NICS.
The distinction between -xi' vs non-xi' nouns is also important for the derivational
morphology since non-xi' nouns when zero-derived to form verbs usually form
attributive, nonactive verbs, whereas verbs zero-derived from -xi' nouns are almost
always active.
    Although case is not overtly marked on nouns, the verbal inflectional clitic is sensitive
to the semantic role that the noun phrase bears in the clause, rigidly observing the
following hierarchy for object agreement (subject agreement is always obligatory,
regardless of the semantic role of the subject):
(c) GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>
    LOCATION>TIMEThat is, if there is a GOAL in the clause, the object portion of the VIC must agree with it
(if there is also a theme, it is usually expressed as the object of the preposition, much as
Relational Grammar’s ‘3→2 Advancement’ would predict); if there is a circumstance
(but no goal) then it will be referenced on the VIC, and so on down the hierarchy, with
remaining roles usually expressed as prepositional objects.","[15, 16]"
"                      1.1.1.1. Direct and indirect speech sentence types
Direct speech forms are common in 'ON narrative, although they are not always glossed
as literal direct speech. See 1.1.1.4.3 for a discussion of verbalized sentences, and
1.1.1.4.3.2.1 for the description of the structure of verbalized direct speech sentences.
    There is no indirect speech type in the language, though the concept can be expressed
in a direct speech present or past tense construction, in which the verbal inflectional clitic
of the matrix clause must be either plural realis past/present or plural passive, as in (1a)
and (2a) respectively. In the case of the latter, the subject of the embedded speech is
coreferential with the object of the matrix clause, and the subject of the matrix clause
must be third person plural, marked only by the VIC, not by a free-form nominal. When
such is not the case, the construction is considered a literal direct speech. The examples
in (1b) and (2b) are only acceptable if they are interpreted as direct speech. An indirect
speech interpretation would not be allowed. The embedded speech in the examples below
is italicized.

          ‘“They went”, they (say) of you.’ (not ‘They say (that) you went’.)This use of the direct speech sentence type to report indirect speech is not available with
future tense. In the past/present direct speech type constructions illustrated in (1) and (2),
the subject of the embedded speech must be coreferential with the object of an active
matrix clause or the subject of a passive clause. In future tense constructions, however,
the subject of the embedded speech must be coreferential with the subject of the matrix
clause. The ungrammatical example in (3b) is wrong for two reasons: (i) as a future tense
construction (see 1.1.1.4.3.2.2), the subject marked in the embedded clause should be
coreferential with the subject of the matrix clause (in the example, it is coreferential with
the object); and (ii) as a so-called indirect speech type, the subject marked in the matrix
clause should be third person (in the example, it is first person). (We gloss carawa as
‘animal’ throughout, because animal is more central to its meaning; but it can also mean
‘thing’.)

                                  1.1.1.2. Interrogative sentences
Interrogative sentences in 'ON belong to two separate classes: simple and COMP
sentences. See 1.1.1.4.2 for a complete discussion of interrogative sentences and their
relation to declarative sentences. The basic structure of simple yes-no and leading
questions is described in 1.1.1.2.1–2, and the basic structure of COMP question-word
questions is described in 1.1.1.4.2.
   There is only one basic intonation pattern in the language: rising pitch through the
verb, reaching high on the last syllable of the verb, and falling sharply on the next
syllable (VIC or postverbal modifier that does not carry stress); it then holds through any
optional arguments until the end of the sentence, or until a demonstrative or sentence-
final particle, in which case it rises on the last syllable of the argument preceding the
                                                      Syntax    11
demonstrative or particle and falls sharply on the demonstrative or particle (see 3.3.4). In
normal speech, the succeeding high pitch is lower than the first high pitch. When there is
emphasis, however, on an argument following the first high pitch, the pitch on the
emphasized argument is higher than the first high pitch—see 3.3.4.1–2 and 1.11.2.1.1.
Interrogative and declarative intonation patterns are basically the same, differing only in
the fact that the pitches of intonation are higher in interrogatives than in declaratives.

            ‘Did you kill fish, children?’The sentence boundary falls between quem and hwijima', and we consider hwijima' to be
an appositional vocative, thus outside the scope of sentence intonation. It receives a
default level intonation.

         ‘Did you kill fish, children?’(4d) and (5) differ intonationally, because in (5), it is hwam rather than pa' that is
emphasized, so hwam gets higher intonation.","[22, 23, 24]"
"                                   1.11.2.2.4. Verbal modifiers
We have only one example of a verbal modifier that is emphasized by means of
reduplication (as part of a compound verb) (368a). Other preverbal modifiers and all
postverbal modifiers can only be emphasized by repeating the entire compounded verb
(368b–c).

           ‘They arrived home.’
                       1.11.2.3. Movement of emphasized elements
Where movement is involved (see 1.11.2.1.3), nothing is left behind when the
emphasized element is the object of the verb (not even a VIC reference); the subject is
anaphorically marked in the VIC. Passivization of the construction prior to left
dislocation can only be done by wa ‘infinitive’, as in (370), not the normal passive VIC.
The only elements which can be left dislocated are those which could be referenced on
the VIC, as per our discussion in 1.2.1.2.3. However, only subjects can be referenced in
the VIC after left dislocation; objects may never be.

                               1.11.3. The focus of yes-no questions
The focus of neutral yes-no questions is marked by increased loudness and higher pitch
on the stressed syllable of the element in focus (see 1.11.2.1.1). The focus of leading yes-
no questions is marked by the use of second person realis future VICS (see 1.1.1.2.1.2),
where a positive question expects a negative answer, and vice versa. Only the subject can
be focused in this manner. So in (373a), for example, ron indicates that the focus is on
Xijam, and in (373b), ram indicates that the focus is on third person singular feminine.

the main thematic line of a discourse.
   The majority of sentences express only the grammatical relations of subject, object,
indirect object or oblique object, but these individual grammatical relations may be
topicalized by a small range of strategies. These devices are used to indicate topic and the
main event line of the text.

"                                       0.2.3. Verbs
The class of verbs is the most productive word class in the language. Most adjectival
notions, as well as traditionally verbal meanings, are expressed as verbs. The majority of
loan words, regardless of the word class in the source language, enter Wari' as verbs.
Verbs may be either transitive, intransitive or ambitransitive, although the last class is
quite small. The last class, as one might expect, subdivides those where the intransitive
subject corresponds to the transitive object from those where the transitive subject
corresponds to the intransitive subject, with the verb for ‘turn over’ representing the first
class and the verb for ‘break’ the second class (e.g. ‘I turned over the baby’ vs ‘The baby
turned over’; ‘The man broke his arm’ vs ‘The man broke’). Perhaps the most remarkable
                                              Wari'    4
fact about verbs in 'ON is the almost complete absence of verbal inflectional processes
alongside a rich set of derivational processes. Nouns, emphatic pronouns and sentences
may all form verbs via zero-derivation. Any verb, whether nonderived or derived
(including ‘desententialized’ verbs, i.e. verbs derived from sentences), may be
compounded to form new verbs or to increase transitivity. Verb compounding never
reduces the transitivity of the verb as a whole, which is set by the leftmost member of the
compound, which we analyse as the head of the compound.
   There are two minor classes of verbs which we have labelled preverbal and postverbal
modifiers. These differ from main verbs in two ways, according to our analysis: (i) they
may never occur in the predicate outside of a compound; and (ii) some of the preverbal
modifiers may also modify nouns, in prehead position within the NP. Verbal compounds
are always constructed according to the following template (superscripts indicate number
of times a category can reoccur in a single sequence. No superscript means that there is
no reoccurrence allowed):
(d)   preverbal modifier effect2 postverbal modifier2 initial action/cause resultEach effect/result is produced by the action of the verb (in its compound) to its immediate
left, suggesting an iconic principle of compound formation.
    Verbs are uninflected by affixation, except for reduplication, which marks aspect.
There are various types of reduplication processes. One interesting aspect of
reduplication is that an inflectional (INFL) morpheme otherwise expected in a particular
clause will sometimes not co-occur with reduplication.
    Aside from compounding, zero-derivation and reduplication, verb morphology in 'ON
is quite simple. Certainly it is one of the simplest morphological systems in Lowland
Amazonia. Nevertheless, this simplicity is deceptive since this language provides perhaps
the strongest evidence yet documented on the ability of the syntax to feed word-
formation, in violation of certain theoretical proposals and frameworks, such as Lexical
Phonology.
    Valency-reducing morphology is represented on the VIC, with special forms for
active, passive, and reflexive. But since VICS are not part of the verb word, these
inflectional processes are actually independent of the verb per se.","[16, 17]"
"                                         2.1.1.4.8. Quality
There is no special nominal inflection marking for quality. The notion of quality (person
with or without a certain quality) can be expressed by the preverbal modifier tama'
‘always’ or the verb taxipa' ‘to befriend’ used in the postverbal modification position
with the meaning of ‘customarily’, appearing optionally with the main verb of the
sentence.

Negative quality is expressed by negating statements expressing quality and by replacing
the verb taxipa' by taxi' ‘to know’ or ‘to be able’.

Reference quality is expressed by a relevant verb with the optional use of the preverbal
modifier tama' ‘always’ or the verb taxipa' ‘befriend’ used as a postverbal modifier,
rendering the meaning of ‘customarily’.

There is no special nominal inflection marking for quantity. Terms of quantity are limited
in the language. They occur as verbs, as follows: xica' pe/to ‘to be alone’/‘to be one’,
tucu caracan ‘to be face-to-face’/‘to be two’, paric ‘to be few’, tocwan ‘to be several’,
mija ‘to be much’, 'iri' mijo ‘to be many’, and xam' ‘to be all of it’. Numerical terms for
‘two’ or more have been borrowed from Portuguese, and they are readily used by the
younger generation; older people, however, usually use only 'ON equivalents wherever
possible. The Portuguese term for ‘one’, um or uma is never used as a substitute for xica'
pe/to ‘to be alone’/‘to be one’.

the name of the material from which they are made, e.g. temem' ‘bow’ is made from the

hard palmwood which bears this name, wao' ‘small woven basket’ is made from the
leaves of the palm tree which bears this name. A statement such as ‘I made the bow with
temem' wood’ would be senseless, because a temem' can only be made with temem'
wood. They would simply say, ‘I made a temem'.’

mats, large baskets, house coverings, canoes, etc. Material in relation to these objects can
be expressed by verbalizing the noun representing the product (i.e. using the first person
singular possessive form), using it as the last member of a compound verb, and

"                         2.1.1.8.7. Number marking on foreign words
Foreign words are used exclusively in their singular form. Number is marked on them in
the same way it is marked on native vocabulary.

                             2.1.1.9. Division of nouns into classes
Nouns are divided into distinct grammatical classes by three features:
feature                  Value
gender                   masculine/feminine/neuter
possession               alienable/inalienable/unpossessable
animacy                  human/nonhuman
                          2.1.1.9.1. Distinguishing affixes or markers
There are no distinguishing characteristics to mark gender or humanness/nonhumanness
on a noun; they are distinguished semantically and/or elsewhere in the clause via
agreement.
   There are two sets of nouns that have inalienable possession. The -xi’ noun class is
marked by the set of inflected possessive suffixes (554a). The other class is a set of
derived kinship terms. The ‘verb’ of the kinship term is the first person singular form of
                                            Morphology    287
the kinship term, and it has the form of a quote (554b), with the possessor having the
form of a subject. See 2.1.1.4.6.1 and 2.2.2.2.1.5, where these two classes of nouns
having inalienable possession are described in detail.

              2.1.1.9.2. Characterization of the class meanings of each class
Division of nouns into classes by gender is determined semantically. Human females are
the only members that belong to the feminine gender class. However, mixed gender
groups (that is, including both males and females), collective nouns (e.g. ‘children’ or
‘siblings’ when males and females are included) are also treated as feminine gender class,
and groups of people including both males and females are also referred to with feminine
markers. The nouns in the examples in (555a–b) are feminine; 'oro wari' in (555c) is
treated as feminine because it is a mixed gender group.
(555) a.             narima'
                     ‘woman’
(555) b.             cainaxi'
                     caina-xi'
                     daughter -1pincl
                     ‘our (incl) daughter’ (spoken by a woman)
(555) c.             Querec                 'inanam                 'oro         wari'.

                     ‘I saw the people (both men and women).’All remaining nouns are divided between the masculine and neuter gender classes.
Although gender is not marked overtly on nouns, their gender may be marked elsewhere
in the clause. The masculine gender class includes all human males and about half of the
culturally significant animals and objects. By ‘culturally significant’, we mean animals
and objects that were familiar to the Wari' before their contact with civilization, or that
played an important role in their pre-contact world view. These include about half of the
small fish, birds, animals and insects; some large fish; about half of the bees; some useful
objects; some phenomena of nature; and about half of large game animals. The examples
in (556) belong to the masculine gender class.

which were not familiar to the Wari' before their contact with civilization. It also includes
small fish, birds, animals, insects and large game animals indigenous to the Wari' area not
included in the masculine gender class. Finally, all subordinate clauses and derived nouns
are neuter in gender. All of the constructions in (557) belong to the neuter gender class.

kinship terms, as well as some useful objects when expressed as a -xi' noun, have
inalienable possession.

possession. Many body parts also have an unpossessable form. Kinship terms do not have
nonpossessed forms.

                                               2.1.3.2. Tense
Tense is only expressed in conjunction with realis mood. See 2.1.3.4. Tense/mood is
marked in simple sentences by three sets of verbal enclitics that we call verbal
inflectional clitics (VICS)—see 1.1.1.4.1, where we discuss the use of Tense active
verbal inflectional clitics in simple sentences. These three sets of VICS also mark the
person and number of the participants of the action. See 2.1.3.6. where we discuss VICS
in detail.
    The three sets of tense/mood VICS cannot be used in all grammatical constructions,
for instance, in COMP sentences (1.1.1.4.2), most subordinate clauses (1.1.2) and derived
nouns (2.2.2.2). In these kinds of constructions, tense/mood is marked by five different
clitics that we call inflection (INFL) morphemes: ca ‘neuter realis past/present’, co
‘masculine/feminine realis past/present’, 'iri' ‘realis past/present’, ta ‘realis future’, and xi
‘irrealis’. When an INFL morpheme appears, person and number (and gender for third
persons) is marked by Tenseless VICS (except with some occurrences of co
‘masculine/feminine realis past/present’ and ‘iri’ ‘realis/past present’—see 1.1.1.4.2).
The complementarity between INFL and VICS is accounted for simply enough: tense,
when it appears, must appear in the sentence-second position (in nonprohibitive matrix
clauses).
    Most constructions require either a tense/mood VIC or an INFL morpheme. However
(see 1.6), with reflexive VICS in simple sentences, tense and mood are not expressed.
Also (see 1.1.1.4.1), there is a small class of verbal modifiers used in simple sentences
which requires the use of Tenseless VICS. Finally (see 1.1.2.3.1), INFL morphemes
sometimes do not function in relative clauses, leaving the clauses unmarked for
tense/mood. The first of each pair of examples below illustrates tense/mood marked by a
VIC, and the second or later of each pair illustrates it marked by an INFL morpheme. The
element illustrating tense/mood is italicized.

2.1.3.2.1.1. Universal tense There is no marking of universal tense in the language.
   2.1.3.2.1.2–3 Past/present tense Past/present tense is marked by the realis
past/present VICS and the past/present INFL morphemes, each in its appropriate
grammatical environment as discussed in 2.1.3.2—see (592). Tense is absolute with
past/present VICS. Past tense can also be specified by three sentence-final particles that
mark degrees of remoteness: ne ‘recent past’ refers to actions done within the last twelve
hours; pane ‘mid/remote past’ refers to actions done the day before or any time earlier up
to a specified point in time many years ago; and pacara pane ‘historic past’ refers to
actions done at some unspecified point in the past. The use of these past tense particles is
optional.

                ‘There were a lot of people a long time ago.’The realis past/present can express the present progressive or continuous aspect (to' na
wom ‘she is washing clothes’) but only when the action is going on in the presence of the
speaker. See 2.1.3.2.1.4, where we discuss a future tense construction that can express the
present perfect aspect when the actor is no longer present at the moment of utterance.
   2.1.3.2.1.4. Future tense The realis future VICS and the realis future INFL morpheme
mark future tense—see example (593). However, the preferred way of expressing future
tense is via the future tense verbalized construction discussed in 1.1.1.4.3.2.2. In this
construction, the derived verb consists of a verb plus the first person singular or plural
inclusive realis future VIC plus an optional object or adjunct. The person of this derived
verb is marked by the realis past/present VIC following it—see the discussion and
examples. This form can also be said to express intentional mood.

            ‘The children will go.’ (Lit. ‘“We will go”, the children (say).’)In order to express the present perfect aspect (e.g. ‘He has gone fishing’), when the actor
is no longer present at the moment of utterance, the future tense verbalized construction
is used. Thus pa' ta' hwam na ‘He will go fishing’ (lit. ‘“I will go fishing”, he (says))’ can
also be freely translated as ‘He has gone fishing.’ When so used, it indicates that the state
of affairs described is a past action with present consequences.
    The sequential verbalized construction discussed in 1.1.1.4.3.3.5 is also commonly
used to express future tense. In this construction, the person of the verb is expressed
within the derived verb, and the tense/mood is expressed by the VIC following the
derived verb. The choice of the third person singular future VIC tara expresses future
tense in this construction. Tara is the only VIC that can express future tense in sequential
verbalized sentences.

              ‘Then they will eat pig.’One reason why the simple use of the realis future VICS/INFL morphemes is a less
common way to express future tense, is that realis future also expresses a modal value of
mere probability.

are realis past/present and irrealis, respectively. Future realis can indicate certainty but
usually carries a degree of uncertainty, indicating that it occupies the middle range of this
continuum. A fact may or may not be so; an action may or may not take place, as
illustrated in the exchanges in (599) and (600).

Realis future VICS are also used to express the imperative mood and the realis future
INFL morpheme ta is used to express the prohibitive mood—see 1.1.1.3. See the
examples in this section.
   Future is not subdivided according to degrees of remoteness, although the spatial
demonstrative cara (without the gloss of ‘always’ or ‘forever’) can also be used, together
with the realis future, to denote an unending future action.

   2.1.3.2.2. Tense distinctions in all moods and nonfinite forms

tense distinction. Tense is also distinguished in nonfinite forms, since they require the use
of INFL morphemes.

                              2.1.3.2.3. Absolute vs relative tenses
Tenses are, for the most part, absolute, with the exception of the future tense construction
discussed in 2.1.3.2.1.4, which also expresses the present perfect aspect. The tenses in
main vs some subordinate clauses are, however, relative, for instance, in time
(1.1.2.4.2.1) and irrealis conditional clauses (1.1.2.4.2.5). See the examples in those
sections.","[322, 323, 324, 325, 326, 327]"

Information about specific constituents within subordinate clauses can be inquired about
in the form of main clause questions. For example, consider (22) and (23):

                       ‘What grew up?’This strategy can also be used to question subordinate clause constituents in examples
such as (19) to (21). For example, consider (19a), repeated below as (24a):
(24)      Mama'              nanain          Guajará.                 Ma'                     ta             comprar

1.1.1.2.2.1.3. Constituents of a noun phrase that can be questioned: The possessor or the
entire NP may be questioned. When the possessor is questioned, the head of the NP must
appear in the question-word position and the possessor cannot be expressed. If the NP
contains a modifier, it cannot appear in the question-word position. Although it need not
be expressed, if a demonstrative is expressed, it must appear in its original position and
may not be moved. Note the ungrammatical examples in (25) and (26).

that express coordination cannot be questioned; only the individual clauses or words of
these juxtaposed structures can be questioned. The questions may be juxtaposed, thus
preserving the notion of coordination expressed in this manner. The fact that either
‘conjunct’ may be questioned, as in (29c), further illustrates the fact that these are not
true coordination.

from (14) to (33). The only instance of clefting occurs when constituents of a NP are
questioned. The head must be moved to sentence-initial position when the possessor is
questioned, but the demonstrative must remain in place if expressed. See 1.1.1.2.2.1.3,
(25) and (26) for grammatical and ungrammatical examples.","[32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]"

                                  1.11.2.1.1. Emphasis by stress
Constituent emphasis may only occur on verb stems and nouns of the sentence. It is
commonly expressed by increased intensity and higher pitch on the stressed syllable of
the constituent marked by [1] in the examples below. Emphasis by stress is not permitted
on VICS. Note the ungrammatical example in (361c). Such emphasis must be expressed
by either the emphatic postverbal modifier pan, described in 1.11.2.1.2, or by the
movement of the emphasized element to the beginning of the sentence as an emphatic
pronoun, as described in 1.11.2.1.3.

                               1.11.2.1.2. Emphatic verbal modifier
The postverbal modifier pan indicates emphasis on the subject. There is not normally any
undue change of stress or pitch on the subject when pan is used. The function of pan is to
clarify the identity of the subject in a particular context. In the following example, it was
not clear from the preceding context for all the interlocutors, who had danced.

                ‘The children danced.’Pan also has a potentially related meaning, which includes the notion of ‘now’, ‘at the
moment’, or ‘for the time being’. It seems to ask for clarification about location (363a) or
give clarifying information about location (363b).

                               1.11.2.1.3. Emphasis by movement
Subjects and objects occur postverbally in all regular clauses, and movement within the
clause is rare. There is, however, a means of expressing emphasis on the subject or object
by the use of emphatic pronouns followed by relative clauses. The emphasized element
occurs in (or ‘is moved to’) initial position in the sentence, i.e. COMP, as in (364).
   When the emphasized element is the subject, it is also expressed anaphorically in the
VIC of the relative clause (364b). The effect of this sentence type is equivalent to clefting
in English. Note that the example in (364a) is, in fact, a kind of copular sentence—see
1.2.1.1.
(364) a.   Je                'i ma'                       ca              tomi'          xim       ne.

           ‘That is what I told you.’
(364) b.    Wirico             Xijam            co                      'oin'       na                 mapac

            ‘It was Xijam who planted corn.’Alternatively, an emphatic pronoun with or without an appositional NP (noun or
demonstrative pronoun) can be verbalized and followed by a headless relative clause, as
in (365a–d). A COMP phrase headed by je can never be followed by a VIC however
(365e). We have no other account for this fact, except to speculate that, although je may
occur as the rightmost member of a verb compound (365f), it may not be verbalized in a
COMP phrase.

                                    1.15. MINOR SENTENCE TYPESThere are three categories of minor sentence types which diverge from the regular vos
sentence structure. These are: (1) exclamatory; (2) VIC sentences; and (3) ideophonic.
   (1) Exclamatory sentences include short, nonverbal responses of one or two words,
vocatives, and utterances consisting of noun phrases. Vocatives may also be part of
normal sentence structure.

                 ‘It is late.’ (lit. ‘(The) night (is) long ago.’)(2) VIC sentences are characterized by the presence of a VIC without a verb. The VIC
may occur alone or with a sentence-final particle (382a–b) or an inflected form of the
preposition (382c) (these three examples are responses to questions or statements); see,
however, (382d), in which there is a subject in the form of a noun clause, and (382e),
where a coordinated construction serves as the subject of the clause. The VIC sentence
appears as a direct speech in (382e). (382d–e) are ‘closures’ to discourses. Structurally, it
could be said that these sentences are the matrix clauses of complex direct speeches, i.e.
the entire discourses.

(3) Ideophonic sentences consist of sequences of (though, occasionally, individual)
onomatopoeic morphemes. They sometimes occur as constituents of compound verbs,
accompanied by VICS, in which case they can be interpreted as direct speeches. Many
recognized verbs also have an onomatopoeic ring to them, and in this connection, it can
be said that their occurrence in sequences of two or three to as many as fifteen or twenty
verbs, without VICS, are further examples of ideophonic sentences. (383) was taken from
a story of the origin of fire. The boys, in the form of birds, were carrying the fire; when
someone called them, they were startled and flew away. The ideophonic elements are in
the last sequence of paratactic clauses.

Nouns may be distinguished by the following morphological criteria: (i) they may bear
possessive suffixes or NICS—see 2.1.1.4.6; and (ii) they may be followed by any one of
the spatial/temporal demonstratives—see 1.2.5.2.5 (note that only two of the
demonstratives, ca' ‘this (neuter) proximate to speaker’ and ma' ‘that proximate to
hearer’, and one of the temporal demonstratives, cara ‘absent’, though without its
accompanying temporal particle, may follow a verb). Besides these morphological
characteristics, the following syntactic criteria apply to nouns: (iii) they may appear alone
as subject or object of the verb, (iv) they may appear as the complement of a form of the
preposition—see 1.2.4; and (v) they may occur in sequence with another noun in a
possessed NP, in which the second element (possessor) can be any noun except a derived
noun, and the first NP is marked by the possessive marking suffixes or NICS referred to
above (functioning semantically as either an actually possessed element or a nominal
modifier—see 1.2.5.2.3).","[226, 227, 228]"
"                        0.2.7.2. Verbal inflectional clitics (VICS)
VICS always express person, number and gender (for third person) of the subject and
‘primary’ object (according to the semantic role hierarchy in (c) above). They also
express tense when the verb is clause-initial, except when tense is prohibited by a
particular postverbal modifier. The VIC is a (simple) clitic. As with NICS, VICS fail to
undergo vowel harmony with the word immediately preceding them, in this case the verb,
and they never bear primary stress. Unlike NICS, however, they can appear alone in
certain types of question responses and discourse circumstances (which certainly argues
against affixal status for them). We analyse each of the two parts of the VIC (subject and
object agreements) as affixes, at least prosodically:
(e)     [VIC subject agreement-object agreement]The two parts of the VIC are stressed as a single word (stress on the last syllable) and
vowel harmony may take the entire VIC in its scope, but is otherwise allowed only within
words, VICS almost always form a single pause or breath group with the verb. By
labelling the VIC as a simple clitic (as per Zwicky 1977; see also Everett 1996), we claim
                                          Wari'   6
that the VIC is in fact a grammatical word, but phonologically dependent, in this case
part of the preceding pause or breath group. Although rhythmically it seems to be part of
the preceding verb, intonation always falls sharply immediately before the VIC.
   VICS may also manifest tense, but only when the VIC is in second position in its
clause. This is a result of the fact that tense in 'ON must occur in sentence second
position; see below.","[18, 19]"
"                                               2.1.1.4.13. Purpose
There is no formal means of expressing purpose such as that found in ‘I went to Guajará
to get clothes’, or ‘I cut wood for my house.’ This concept may be expressed by two
juxtaposed sentences, the second of which conveys purpose in the following ways.
   (1) By means of a verbalized future tense sentence, described in 1.1.1.4.3.2.2.
(425)       Mao        'inain                 Guajará.             Cut          ta'          wom          ina

            pane.
            rem:past
            ‘I went to Guajará. “I will get clothes”, I (said).’(2) By means of the purpose type of verbal modification clause described in 1.1.2.4.2.3,
in which the purpose clause is expressed as a direct speech, reflecting the thoughts that
motivate the situation. Though (425) is not illformed, (426) is preferred.
(426)      Mao       'inain            Guajará.             Ma'                         ta              cut         ta'

                                                2.1.1.4.14. Function
Function is expressed like material (see 2.1.1.4.10): it occurs as a denominalized verb
(first person singular possessive form), and the element to which it is related appears as
the object of the verb.
(427)                Quit                ne                         'inain                        pana.

                     ‘I used the stick as a knife.’
                                                2.1.1.4.15. Reference
There is no special nominal inflection marking reference. Reference is expressed as a
nominal, appearing as the direct object of a verb expressing communication (e.g. pijim'
‘tell’, tomi' ‘to speak’, coromicat ‘to think’). Note its function with an indirect object in
(428b), where the indirect object is marked in the object (suffix) VIC, and the (logical)
direct object is expressed by a prepositional phrase.

                                                 2.1.1.4.16. Essive
Essive is expressed by two juxtaposed sentences, the essive element being in the second
sentence:

                                           2.1.1.4.17. Translative
Translative is expressed as direct speech in the form of a first person singular possessed
noun.

            ‘The people made Xijam chief.’ (lit. ‘“My chief”, the people (said) to Xijam.’)When the translative element is possessed, it must be rephrased as a direct speech
embedded in a direct speech. The translative element may only be expressed in a first
person singular possessed form.

                                          2.1.1.4.19. Partitive
2.1.1.4.19.1–4. Partitive and nonpartitive numeral and quantifier Numeral and
quantifier forms are limited in the language. See 2.1.1.4.9, where we list the verbs that
express numeral and quantity in 'ON. Numerals, including dois ‘two’, are borrowed from
Portuguese (duas ‘two (f)’ is rarely used). Um is never used as a substitute for the verb
xica' pe/to ‘to be alone’/‘to be one’.
   There are no formal means of expressing partitive. There are no significant syntactic
distinctions between numeral and quantifier as they relate to partitive, nor is the line
between partitive and nonpartitive clear. Partitive numeral and quantifier employ
numerals or numeral/quantifier verbs as postverbal modifiers to form a compound with
the verb ma' ‘to exist’. The verb describing the action of the element to which partitive is
related appears in a relative clause whose head is the subject of the verb ma'. This
construction may also be construed to express nonpartitive.

specifically, as in (434), where the number or numeral/ quantifier verb appears in the
postverbal modification position with the verb describing the action of the element to
which nonpartitive is related. There is no relative clause in nonpartitive constructions.

(436) b.      Mija                             non                                                       tan!

              ‘He has a lot of money!’ (lit. ‘Leaves are much to him!’)Portuguese monetary terms have been incorporated into the language in a limited way:
real and centavo (Brazilian monetary units) usually appear in a compound verb with a
preposed number; dinheiro, the Portuguese term for ‘money’ but generally used as ‘price’
in 'ON, usually appears as a noun, invariably accompanied by a postposed possessive
marking NIC, as in the following exchange:

              ‘What is the price of kerosene?’ (lit. ‘How much is light’s water’s money?’)
(437) b.                 Dois                real        na                     dinheiro                   nein.

                         ‘Its price (money) is two reais.’Though both (437) and (438) are acceptable forms, the tendency is to avoid the borrowed
terms as much as possible. (438) is usually preferred to (437).

                                     ‘Its price (leaves) is two.’The relationship shown by English bought it for is usually expressed in a sequence of two
sentences.
(439) Ji'ao 'ina                            comi                 naran.           Dois na                        taji.

           ‘I bought kerosene for two reais.’ (lit. ‘I poured light’s water. Its leaves were two.’)
                                           2.1.1.4.22–23. Distance and extent
Specific terms for distance and extent are lacking in the language. Portuguese terms have
been borrowed in a limited way; they usually appear as verbs. Relationships are
expressed in a sequence of two sentences, similar to that of price and value in (439). The
first sentence contains a proposition, the quantity implied in distance or extent being
expressed by an 'ON equivalent in the VP. The borrowed term is expressed with a
preposed number in the VP of the second sentence, and its subject usually reiterates the
verb of the first sentence, or a meaning similar to it, in a noun clause or derived noun.

                                                  2.1.1.4.24. Concessive
There is no special form for marking nominals for the concessive case. Concessive is
expressed by the contraexpective type of verbal modification clause. It is usually
preceded by a clause with paxi' ‘not:find’, which is described in 1.1.2.4.2.8.
(441)      Pan'        paxi'               na             xowi'.         'Ane           maqui'            ta'    ne.

                                                   2.1.1.4.25. Inclusion
When an element is to be specifically mentioned as included in a group, it is expressed in
a second sentence as a topicalized element, either as the subject or the left dislocated
topic—see 1.12. The referent particle quem is postposed to the topicalized element.

                                                    2.1.1.4.26. Exclusion
Like inclusion, exclusion is expressed by a sequence of two sentences. The first expresses
the proposition; the second specifies the element to be excluded from the group. A
relative clause is often used in the second sentence.
(443) a.    Cao' cao' xam'                 nana          'oro           wari'.       Xica'                pe         na

                                                     2.1.1.4.27. Addition
Addition is expressed by a sequence of two sentences, the first of which states the
original proposition, while the second states who is to be ‘added’ to the action of the first.
The referent particle quem is also postposed to the element to be ‘added’ to the action of
the first sentence. The verb mo ‘list presentation’ and the VP ca' na ‘thus it is/was’ are
often used to specify the participants of the addition element (see coordination 1.3).
(444)       Cao'         na               Xijam.            Cao'        nana           mana       panxica           quem.

Vocative nominals usually occur at the end of the sentence. There is no vocative particle.

                              2.1.1.4.29–30. Citation and label forms
Citation and label forms are expressed in the following forms:
   (i) Possessed nouns are expressed in their basic form, which is first person plural
inclusive, i.e. winaxi' ‘our heads’ for ‘heads’ in general.
   (ii) Verbs and unpossessed nouns may also be expressed as nominals with the
infinitival/participial marker wa. When the verb is reduplicated, as in (446a–b), the
postverbal modifier qui' ‘coming:this:way’ always accompanies it.
(446) a.     ca                         pana        pana           qui'                               wa          ca'

Location in space is expressed (1) by verbs (compound or simple); and/or (2) by body-
part nouns. While the type of location (general, interior, ulterior, etc.) may be expressed
by the body-part noun functioning as the object of the verb, movement in relation to the
location (‘at rest’, ‘motion to’, ‘motion from’, or ‘motion past’) is expressed only by the
verb. The noun to which the local function is related appears as an object of the verb, or
as the possessor of an object of the verb. We will describe in this section the means for
expressing local semantic functions, although none of these involves special case
marking on the noun.","[250, 251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257, 258, 259]"
"                                          2.1.3.5. Nonfinite forms
There are two ways of marking nonfinite forms: (1) the infinitival marker wa; and (2) the
set of nominal inflectional clitics that marks possession on free and derived nouns—see
1.10. Tense/mood is marked in nonfinite forms by the INFL morpheme preceding the
verb.

Table 2.1 offers, at a glance, the different categories of verbal inflectional clitics that
mark agreement with the subject and direct object/indirect object/benefactive of verbs.
All VICS follow the verb. All the verbal inflectional clitics in Table 2.1 indicate person
and number. Some of them also indicate tense/mood, and others indicate third person
gender. In addition, number is indicated in verbs that have a singular and plural form. A
more complete discussion follows.
    2.1.3.6.1.1. Subject The person and number of the subject must be coded in the VIC.
In addition, tense/mood is coded in the Tense VICS, and third person gender is coded in
the Tenseless VICS (which usually co-occur with INFL). There are three sets of Tense
VICS: realis past/present, realis future, and irrealis; they occur in simple sentences. There
is a single set of Tenseless VICS which occurs in most COMP sentences. They must also
be used when a small class of verbal modifiers functions in simple sentences—see
                      Table 2.1 Categories of verbal inflectional clitics
              Tense                                               Tenseless               Object
Active        realis past/present realis future irrealis          simple uninflected      object
Non-active    passive 1                                           passive 2               reflexive/reciprocal
1.1.1.4.1 and 1.1.1.4.2. Passive 1 VICS (‘Tense’) are like Tense active VICS in not co-
occurring with INFL, but are unlike them in not expressing tense themselves. Passive 2
VICS (‘Tenseless’) function like Tenseless active VICS in co-occurring with INFL.
   Subject person is coded by the choice of the appropriate subject VIC. In addition,
subject humanness/nonhumanness is coded by the choice of singular vs plural subject
VICS: only humans can be marked by plural VICS; both singular and plural nonhumans
must be marked by singular VICS. Subject number is also coded by the correct choice of
the intransitive verb (see 2.2.3.1, where we discuss agreement of subject/object with
singular and plural verb forms). Both human and nonhuman plural subjects must be
marked by the plural form of intransitive verbs.

person gender of the object may be coded in the VIC. The single set of object morphemes
occurs as suffixes on subject morphemes, with this pair of affixes functioning together as
a postverbal clitic. The object morphemes agree with the person and number of all
objects, and gender of third person objects, whether overt or covert (see 2.1.2.3.1).

            ‘Hatem cooked the fish for To'o.’The same rules for coding person and number in the subject also apply to objects. In
addition to coding object number by the correct choice of the object affix, it can also be
coded by the correct choice of the form of the verb, if it is one of the transitive verbs that
has a singular and plural form. In contrast to intransitive verbs, where both human and
nonhuman plural subjects must be indicated, when possible, by the plural form of the
verb, transitive verbs do not always require the use of plural forms to indicate plural
objects. The plural form of transitive verbs can clarify the number of the object, but it
also describes the scope of the action. Less intense actions of a shorter duration tend to be
marked by singular forms, while more intense actions of a longer duration tend to be
marked by plural forms. The choice of the singular or plural form of the verb in these
situations depends on how the speaker views the situation; it is largely subjective.

(2) VICS fail to undergo word-internal phonological changes which ordinarily happen
when morphemes are suffixed to nouns. For example, in the derived noun copari’ ‘our
maternal grandmother’ (co-pa'-'iri' INFL:m/frp/ p-maternal:grandmother: 1s-1pincl) two
phonological changes take place when ‘iri’ is suffixed to pa': there is vocalic harmony
(a+i=a) and the glottal is deleted—see 3.2.6.4 for the complete discussion of vowel
harmony. By contrast, VICS that follow verbs do not undergo these phonological
changes.

VICS bears secondary stress, while the last syllable of verbs bears primary stress.

Copular sentences do not exist. This notion is expressed by what would be the nominal,
adjectival, or adverbial complement of a copular appearing as the verb of the sentence.
The element in the verbal position is accompanied by a VIC like any verb, so that to say,
for example, ‘the baby is a man (male)’, ‘the house is small’, or ‘the boy is fast’, one
says, ‘the baby mans (males)’, ‘the house smalls’, and ‘the boy fasts’. Nouns may be
zero-derived, i.e. occur in the verb position without any morphological changes (167a), or
a noun may occur as a derived verb as described in 2.2.2.1.2.2 by using one of its
inflections (167b–c). The notion of adverbial is expressed by a regular verb (167d).

                 ‘The child is fast.’ (lit. ‘The child fasts.’)One might attempt to dispute our analysis of the above clauses, arguing instead that the
VIC is acting as a copular verb and that the material on both sides of it is nominal,
functioning as a predicate adjective/nominal. However, there are at least five reasons to
reject this analysis in favour of the analysis in the text, namely, that the material to the
left of the VIC is in fact a zero-derived verb. The reasons are as follows:
(a) Nouns appearing to the left of the VIC are interpreted descriptively (but predicatively)
   in the second and third person forms, but actively or even agentively in their first
   person form.
(b) These apparent nominals may be compounded with verbs or verbal modifiers.
(c) When compounded, they may undergo semantic drift.
(d) When nonfinal in a compound, a nominal may not bear primary stress (unless
   followed by a stress-rejecting modifier).
(e) These noun-verb compounds may be preceded by COMP+INFL sequences.
Moreover, if material to the left of VICS in these ‘copular’ constructions was nonverbal,
this would be the only case in the language where a VIC attaches to nonverbal material.
Segments (a)–(e) are discussed in detail in section 2.2.
    The closest thing to a copular construction is a nonverbal sentence in which the
demonstrative ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’, or one of its variants (mon ‘singular
masculine’, momon ‘plural masculine’, mam ‘singular feminine’, mamam ‘plural
feminine’, and main ‘neuter'), or an emphatic pronoun, occurs in the sentence-initial
position, optionally followed by a demonstrative and an NP (which may take the form of
a noun derived from a sentence (168h)). There is no overt be-copula. The demonstrative
in the NP is not obligatory, though it usually occurs.

Most 'ON sentences are manifested (overtly at least) by the verb only. The occurrence of
one argument with the VP (either the expressed object, subject, or some other
constituent) is common, but the occurrence of two arguments is fairly uncommon. More
than two arguments can occur, but this is even rarer.","[124, 125, 126, 127, 128]"
"                                           1.16.2. Pronoun
There are two classes of pronouns: (1) demonstrative and (2) emphatic.
    (1) The demonstrative pronoun is a subclass of nouns. It satisfies three of the syntactic
criteria that define the noun: (i) it may appear by itself as the subject or object of the verb;
                                        Wari'   216
(ii) it may appear by itself as the complement of a form of the preposition; and (iii) it may
appear as the second element (possessor) of a possessed NP. It is different from
nonpronominal nouns, however, in that it cannot be suffixed or postposed by an NIC or
possessive marking suffix, nor can it be followed by a demonstrative.
    (2) The emphatic pronoun is not a subclass of nouns. It cannot occur by itself as the
subject or object of the verb, nor can it appear as the complement of a form of the
preposition. It is marked by its potential to occur alone (in the case of first and second
person) or in apposition to a noun or demonstrative pronoun (in the case of third person)
in coordinate constructions (see 1.3.3) or to express emphasis (see 1.11.2.1.3).","[228, 229]"
"                                        1.11.2.1.7. Emphasis by repetition
Just as sentence emphasis can be expressed by repetition, so emphasis of the verb can be
expressed by repetition. This may be in the form of reduplication of a syllable of the verb
(366a), reduplication of a verb root (366b), reduplication of part or all of a compound
verb stem (366c–d), or reduplication of the entire verb+VIC (366e). Reduplication of a
syllable of a verb derives plural and intensive meaning from singular, simple verbs (see
2.2.4 and 3.4.7).

Any NP may be emphasized by increased loudness and higher pitch on the head of the
phrase. NPS in the subject or object position of the sentence may be emphasized by the
postverbal modifier pan. If emphasis is desired on both subject and object
simultaneously, the subject will be marked by pan and the object by increased loudness
and pitch. NPS may also be emphasized by co-occurrence with emphatic pronouns
preceding a relative clause. See 1.11.2.1.1–3.","[216, 217]"

The subject of an intransitive verb is (usually) marked on the VIC. (The VIC is
sometimes deleted in series of actions in discourses.) Third person subject may also be
overtly expressed by an NP—see 1.2.1.2.1. Like the direct object of a transitive verb, the
subject of an intransitive verb governs the number agreement on suppletive or
reduplicated verb forms: a plural intransitive subject requires the plural form of the
intransitive verb (a plural object requires the plural form of a transitive verb)—see
2.1.3.6.1.1. There is no distinction between subjects of intransitive verbs as agent or
nonagent.

The subject of a transitive verb is (usually) marked on the VIC. Third person subject may
also be overtly expressed by an NP—see 1.2.1.2.1. The number of the subject of a
transitive verb does not govern plural marking on the verb—see 2.3.1.6.1.1. The form of
the overtly expressed subject of a transitive verb is the same as that of an overtly
expressed direct object, unless there is an indirect object in the sentence, in which case
the (erstwhile) direct object occurs in a prepositional phrase—see 1.2.1.2.3.1. When both
subject and object are overtly expressed, the subject almost always follows the object—

                         2.2.2.2.2. Zero-derivation of nouns from verbs
A few nouns are derived from verbs simply by zero-derivation. This process is not
productive, but it is semantically regular. We have the following examples: horon ‘old
person’ is the plural, intense form of the verb hwara' ‘to be big’; mo'o ‘bearer of death
news’, when used as a verb, means ‘to notify of a death and bring back the mourners’;
mowa ‘poison vine’ means ‘to kill fish’ by crushing the poison vine and squeezing the
juices into a dammed up area of the river; and wac, used by most sub-groups to signify
‘knife’, while meaning ‘to cut’ as a verb. In addition, many nouns (names of animals,
birds, fish and objects) could be said to be derived from verbs, since they are
onomatopoeic terms (direct speeches), which are handled as verbs in the language. See
4.1 for examples.

                          2.2.2.3. Zero-derivation of operator words
Operator words, which mark moods or movement in the sentence and occur in COMP,
are zero-derived from various word classes: demonstrative, pronoun, preposition and
verb. They are semantically regular in that their meanings are fairly transparent and their
origins are clear:
ma'   signals interrogation (from ma' ‘that proximate to hearer’)
'om   signals negation (from 'om ‘to not exist’)
je    signals affirmation (from je ‘third person neuter emphatic pronoun’)
'ac   signals indication of resemblance (from 'ac ‘to be like’)
mo    signals condition (possibly from mo ‘list presentation’)
'ane signals contraexpectation (from 'ane ‘to be different’)
pain signals subordination and (?) distant past (from pain ‘third person neuter preposition’)ma' has three alternate forms that are derived by means of the third person singular object
suffix verbal inflectional morphemes: -on ‘masculine’, -m ‘feminine’, and -in ‘neuter’.
Mon, mam and main also signal interrogation.
   cain' signals interrogation. It is derived from cain ‘that neuter distal’. If we are correct
in our analysis of this form, as deriving from cain, the glottal is added, meaning that this
is not simply zero-derivation. See 2.2.6, where we describe verbs derived from nominals
by this same process.
   See 1.1.1.4.2, where we discuss operator words and their function in COMP sentences.","[381, 382]"

           3.2.6.7. Differences between phonotactic patterns with different word
                                          classes
Many ideophones employ sounds that are used nowhere else in the language. We have
not included any of these variations from the normal phonology of the language in this
study.
   Portuguese loan words are assimilated into 'ON phonology. For example, Portuguese
/s/ and /z/ are realized as 'ON        or one of its allophones; Portuguese /f/ and /v/ are
realized as 'ON [w], [h] or [hw], but we have found no rule to predict exactly which of
these forms will be adopted. Portuguese /!/ is realized as 'ON [ſ]; and all voiced plosives
are realized as voiceless plosives. When speaking Portuguese, Wari' people tend to have
difficulty distinguishing between Portuguese voiced vs voiceless plosives. They also find
it difficult to distinguish Portuguese /m/ from Portuguese /b/ and Portuguese /n/ from
Portuguese /d/.
    With regard to effects on suprasegmental features of loan words, it is interesting to
note that, in spite of the fact that all 'ON words are oxytones, Portuguese oxytones are
stressed as paroxytones when borrowed into 'ON, while Portuguese paroxytones are
stressed as oxytones, or their last unstressed syllable is dropped. For example, biribá ‘a
fruit species’ is pronounced [mbI'rima]; and cobertor ‘blanket’ (ultimate stress) is
                                            Wari'   404
pronounced [ko'mbeto]; leite ‘milk’ is pronounced           remédio ‘medicine’ is
pronounced [he'me]; canoa ‘canoe’ (penultimate stress) is pronounced [ka'no]; and
cachorro ‘dog’, is pronounced                .","[416, 417]"
"                                   1.16.12. Ideophones
Ideophones are onomatopoeic words that express the sound of actions. Many ideophones
deviate from phonological norms of the language: (1) some employ phonological units
not found elsewhere in the language; (2) vowels are often exaggeratedly lengthened; and
(3) varied intonation is often employed: high, low, whispered, etc. See 4.1.

Aside from the marking discussed under 2.1.1.1.1 and 2.1.1.1.3, there are no other ways,
other than in kinship terms (see 2.2.2.2.1.5), for directly marking noun functions on the
noun. But in what follows, we indicate how the different functions are expressed.","[230, 231]"
"
(4) VICS bear secondary stress. The general rule for stress is that primary stress falls on
the last syllable of the word, and secondary stress, if there is any, precedes it. If VICS
were suffixes, they would provide the only exception to this stress rule in the language:
secondary stress would follow primary stress (622a).
   To summarize, these are clitics that behave like separate words outside of
compounding processes (see kinship terms in (624) that make one word out of two or
more words).
   The paradigms of all the VICS are shown in Table 2.2.

There is only one basic intonation pattern in the language: rising pitch through the verb,
reaching high on the last syllable of the verb, and falling sharply on the next syllable
or postverbal modifier that does not carry stress); it then holds through any optional
arguments until the end of the sentence, or until a demonstrative or sentence-final
particle, in which case it rises on the last syllable of the argument preceding the
demonstrative or particle and falls sharply on the demonstrative or particle. In normal
speech, the second high pitch is lower than the first high pitch. Interrogative and
declarative intonation patterns are basically the same, differing only in the fact that the
peaks of intonation are higher in interrogatives than in declaratives (816d–f).

In contrast to normal speech, where the higher pitch of intonation falls on the verb, the
higher pitch of intonation is transferred to the emphasized constituent when a constituent
other than the verb is emphasized.

invited to agree with the statement evoking emphasis.

(1) By the use of emphatic phrases
   The use of some sentence-final emphatic phrases causes certain morphological
changes in the sentence: ca'/ma' quira and ca'/ma' 'ira, consisting of a demonstrative
followed by an emphatic morpheme, require the use of Tenseless VICS in the VP.
Ca'/ma' quira and ca'/ma' 'ira can be spoken by both men and women.

   There are some restrictions in the use of sentence final emphatic morphemes: wira and
nowa are used only by men speakers (354a–b); cama/ camara and je are used only by
women speakers (354c–d); (cama is used when addressing one woman; tacamara is used
when addressing more than one woman); and wa (354e) may be used by both men and
women speakers, although usually only men use it.

              ‘You pierce his other ear!’Wa (spoken by men and women) and je (spoken by women) seem to be derived from the
interjections howa (spoken by men) and hije (spoken by women). It is interesting to note
that howa also functions as a verb, meaning ‘to believe’.

   See 1.4.3 for a complete description and examples of the use of double negatives to
express a strong, emphasized positive.

       ‘She’s touching me!’ (lit. ‘“She should not do me consenting”, I (say) of this feminine one.’)(5) By the combined use of xi' ‘dubitative’, Tenseless VICS and certain sentence-final
spatial/temporal morphemes (ca' ‘this neuter proximate to speaker’, ma' ‘that proximate
to hearer’, ne ‘recent past’ or pane ‘remote past’)
   Although xi' expresses doubt or supposition in the emphatic verbalized sentence given
in (352) above, it seems to express certainty in its use here. This means of expressing
emphasis is used mainly as a supportive commentary on what has already been said,
either by the same speaker or another speaker. It also seems to be a device used when
there has been a diversion, to bring the hearers back to the subject at hand.

   In this case the first word of each sentence is often spoken with high intonation and
exaggeratedly lengthened vowel (359a). Sometimes the ‘repetition’ is expressed in
contrasting sentences, as in (359b). We mention this here, because this phenomenon
shares with repetition the function of building redundancy into the text.

2.2.3.1.2.1. Serial vs compounding One plausible alternative to our compounding
analysis would be to treat these as serial verbs rather than compound verbs. However, this
analysis does not seem to be what is wanted here for semantic, syntactic and
phonological reasons. Semantically, serial verb constructions should maintain the basic
translation of each verb in the string, rarely ‘adding’ them together at the end. This
indeed does seem to work for examples like (733):
(733)      Juc        wao            ron                coxa'                                                  ma.

           ‘Swing your little brother.’You push your little brother and you (by pushing) swing him. But now notice the
problem if we add the verb pi'am ‘sleep’ to this.
(734)      Juc        wao           pi'am      ron                coxa'

           ma.
           2s
           ‘Swing your little brother to sleep.’There is a clear causative meaning to the verb pi'am (and arguably to wao ‘swing’ as
well) in (734). If these were merely serial verbs, one might expect them all to ‘unify’ (à
la Baker 1988), where they all shared the same subject. But in its non-
serial/noncompound use, sleep could only have as its subject coxa' ma ‘your little
brother’, not ‘you’ as it does here. Consider too the case of an intransitive verb
compounded with/followed by a transitive verb:
(735)             Com                taxipa'                       nana                    hwijima'.

                  ‘The children customarily sing.’Taxipa' ‘befriend’ would otherwise be a transitive verb. Used following an intransitive
verb, however, it never has this transitive meaning but only the modificational, aspectual
meaning ‘customarily’. This type of semantic drift is typical of compounding, but not of
incorporation. In the examples which follow, this type of semantic drift, or
noncompositionality, is manifested in varying degrees.

                             ‘Then he touched it.’In example (736d), 'ac ‘travel’ is interpreted as a sequential aspect, rather than a separate
verb ‘to travel’. This type of fact is compatible with either a compounding or suffixation
analysis (where morphemes can function as verbs or aspectual suffixes depending on
                                           Morphology             373
their position in the word), but not, it seems to us, with a simple serial verb structure.
Other more extreme examples are:
(737) a.     Tomi'            querec             te                     napa'                      pije'.
                                                                        na-pa'

             ‘The child is happy (lit. ‘speaks, sees and says “My father”) with me.’
(737) b.               Mi'                 pin                                        na.

                       ‘He died (lit. gave completely).’
(737) c.         Xiram                                     pa'               napa'.
                                                                             na-pa'
                 press:down                                upon              3s:rp/p-1s
                 ‘He feels sorry for (lit. presses down upon) me.’Such semantic drift is expected under a compounding analysis, but not under a
suffixation nor a serial verb analysis.
   Phonologically, a string of independent words would receive stress on each word in
the string. In the verbs above, however, this is not the case. Primary stress is placed only
on the final verb of the string (with the verbs to the left receiving very light secondary
stresses at most). If these form a single compound verb (or affixed verb), this is to be
expected. It is harder to account for by a serial verb analysis. (At least it is less
economical, since we need compounding already to handle semantically opaque cases
like those in (737), and the ‘serial verb’ construction would be formally identical.)
   Syntactically, the verbs in a serial verb construction should share the same subject.
That is not the case here, however, if we merely take the literal meaning of each verb:
(738)      Querec        querec           mao           'inon                    cawiji         pane.
                                                        'ina-on
           see           see              go:s          1s:rp/p-3sm              son:1s         rem:past
           ‘I saw my son off long ago.’ (lit. ‘I saw-went my son long ago.’)This sentence can be uttered even when the speaker (the subject referenced on the VIC)
does not go anywhere. It is the son that is doing the going in (738), not the speaker. At
the same time, however, the speaker is not causing the son to go, so a simple causative
analysis would miss the mark. A compound analysis can handle this by assuming that the
second verb is the result or object of the first, forming a single complex event of seeing
and going of which the subject is the ‘seer’ (because as leftmost verb, ‘see’ will be the
head of the compound and thus determine the subject of the verb, while the subject of
‘go’, the son, will be the object of the compound verb). In other words, while this has the
superficial form of a causative, it is in fact a new, compound verb. Consider the case of a
plural object:
(739)      Querec      querec          mama'          'inonon             'oro      wari'        pane.
                                                          Wari'      374
                                                                'ina-ocon
           see               see              go:p              1s:rp/p-3pm                coll    person         rem:past
           ‘I saw the people off long ago.’ (lit. ‘I saw-went the people long ago.’)Here the suppletive plural form of the verb ‘to go’, mama', is used. This follows if the
construction in (739) is either a serial construction or a compound, since in the former
case, 'oro wari' 'the people' is the subject of mama' ‘to go’, and in the latter case, it is the
object of the entire verb compound, querec querec mama'. But the compound analysis is
again preferred, since without it, we would have to allow for a sequence of verbs
inflected as one, but with different subjects. We conclude, therefore, based on semantics,
syntax and phonology that multiverbal complexes in 'ON are verb compounds and not
serial verbs. Before concluding, however, we also want to argue that our compounding
analysis is also superior to an incorporation analysis.
   2.2.3.1.2.2. Incorporation vs compounding Some structures which we have analysed
as zero-derivation plus compounding, might instead be analysed as incorporation. (We
will ignore the possibility of verbal incorporation here, since this would be nearly
equivalent to a serial verb analysis, already rejected.) Consider (740):
(740) a.                  Wina                  quiji'                      mao             na                   motor.

                          ‘The motor turned upside down.’

             that:prox:hearer
             ‘The waram monkey had a short tail (lit. played around at having a tail).’However, we can safely reject this analysis, based on examples like (741):

               ‘To'o, as a woman, toasted farinha.’In the above examples, there is no possible verb-external source for the incorporated N. It
cannot be the object, since that position is filled. Nor could the incorporated N have
plausibly originated as possessor of the object. Thus we reject incorporation as the source
of the compound verbs in (740)–(741), analysing them instead by (i) zero-derivation of
the ‘nominal’ part of the compound ([N]→[V[N]]), followed by (ii) compounding.
   Yet another argument against incorporation comes from our earlier discussion of zero-
derivation of verbs from nouns (see 2.2.2.1.2.2). The form of the noun which appears to
the left of the VIC is not predictable from anything to the right of the VIC, i.e. cannot be
predicted via movement into the verb from pre-existent deep structure. Moreover, the
form of the noun which appears in the verb affects the translation of the compound or
simple denominalized verbs in only roughly predictable ways, much more easily
accounted for by compounding, whose semantics are often less than fully compositional,
than by incorporation, which, at least by Baker’s (1988) account, would be expected to be
fully compositional, with no semantic drift at all. We therefore reject incorporation as an
analysis of the above verb forms.","[382, 383, 384, 385, 386, 387, 388, 389]"

2.1.3.1.1.1. Personal passive Passive is expressed by nonactive verbal inflectional clitics,
as well as by the infinitival marker wa. Like all other verbal inflectional clitics, they
follow the verb. They do not express tense/ mood. Passive VICS express person, number
and gender. One set of passive VICS occurs where Tense active VICS would be used,
and the other occurs where Tenseless active VICS would be used. Gender is marked only
on the latter set. We will refer to these as ‘Tense’ and ‘Tenseless’ passive VICS, to
indicate their distribution, even though they do not really mark tense/mood. ‘Tense’
passive VICS can occur in simple sentences just as the realis and irrealis VICS, but they
tend to be used rarely. The use of ‘Tenseless’ passive VICS is preferred, because they
function in constructions in which tense/mood is marked in INFL morphemes or in
verbalized sequential- and comparative-type sentences, as in the following examples.
Note that (582d) illustrates the use of the infinitival marker to express passive.

                      ‘She is the one who was seen.’The two paradigms of passive VICS seem to be incomplete. There are forms for all but
the first person plural, and we are not certain about the existence of the first person
singular. (BK thinks she may have heard examples with first person singular, but there is
no record of it in the corpus.) The second person clitics are rarely used. Third person
clitics are quite common, especially the ‘Tenseless’ class. The reason for this disparity in
the use of third person passives versus first and second person passives may be the
following: since passive (among other things) demotes the agent, the use of the passive is
less crucial for first and second persons, since they never fill grammatical relation
positions in the sentence and, therefore, do not need to be demoted.
    The complete paradigm of ‘Tense’ passive VICS is as follows:
first singular                                                                 xita (?)

The reciprocal relation, as noted in the preceding section, is expressed by the plural forms
of the reflexive VICS. The use of the reflexive VICS is described in 1.6.

                  therefore                           angry                    refl:2p
                  ‘Why are you angry with each other (or yourselves)?’The postverbal modifier caracan ‘each other’ is often used in conjunction with the
reflexive (reciprocal) VICS to explicitly express reciprocality.
(332)               Mana'                caracan                         xequequem.

                    ‘They are angry with each other.’Reciprocals, reflexives, and passive constructions all share a common discourse
function—they reduce the topicality difference between the agentas-subject and the
object-as-patient (goal, theme, etc.). The passive (see 2.1.3.1.1) does this by promoting
the agreement expressed as an object in the active construction to the subject of the
passive. The agent is removed, i.e. is not expressed overtly, in a passive clause.
Reciprocals and reflexives reduce the topicality of the agent-as-subject by equating agent
with the object upon which it acts in the VIC. That is, a reflexive/reciprocal VIC
eliminates the subject-object distinction by failing (like the passive, but unlike the active)
to distinguish between subject and object in agreement. Since 'ON lacks case marking
and only distinguishes between subject and (primary) object via the VIC (other objects
are marked by the preposition), obliteration of any subject-object VIC distinction
effectively means that subject=object topically and semantically. This in effect increases
the relative prominence of nonsubject arguments. So for example, in (333), the duck
referenced by con ‘prep:3sm’ is the topic of the paragraph from which (333) was taken.
In the (embedded) clause in which it occurs, there is no distinctive reference to the
subject, only the reflexive VIC.
(333)      Mi'     ne           con,          wina      pan     ta'       na              Maxun.   'Awin

‘“Give it to me, I will raise (it)”, (said) Maxun. He took it from him.’ (lit. ‘…they took it from each
other.’)In (334), dead people cannot be agents and so dead people cannot be expressed in the
most highly topical agent-as-subject form. But the reciprocal translation (‘they did not eat
each other’) obliterates the syntactic distinction between subject (the ones doing the
eating) and the object (the dead people). The use of reflexive/reciprocal here promotes
‘dead people’ to the role of grammatical actor, indicating that it is in focus. (334) is from
a report of several deaths during the initial contact with non-Indian society. Note the use

   Such verbs as tiquin' mao ‘to continue on’, tiquin' ca' ‘to pass up’, juc 'in pin ‘to push

comparative. Sentences using these verbs and preverbal modifier are still often
accompanied by the juxtaposition of similar or contrasting sentences. See (336b) for an
example of the preverbal modifier 'amon expressing comparison.

Anaphora is expressed by deletion in the following circumstances: (1) deletion of the
matrix clause in direct speech sentences; (2) deletion of any or all of the constituents
except the verb in long discourses; (3) deletion of any or all of the main constituents other
than the VICS in response to statements or questions; (4) deletion of any or all of the
constituents other than the questioned element in answer to questions; and (5) deletion of
the head of relative clauses.
   (1) Deletion of the matrix clause in direct speech sentences
   Direct speech occurs as the derived predicate of a verbalized direct speech sentence
(see 1.1.1.1). Subject VICS mark the speaker, and object VICS (suffixes) mark to whom
or of whom the speech is made. The matrix clause (all elements other than the embedded
speech) is often deleted in narrative discourse. This is especially common when
recounting a dialogue. The example in (308) is taken from text.

‘“Toro” (went the sound) when Tocorom Mip came with 'Amtara'. “Did you come?” “We came.”
“Did you kill (something)?” “We killed (something).”’(2) Deletion of any or all of constituents except the verb in long discourses
   As in the deletion of the matrix clause in direct speech sentences, all of the
constituents other than the verb (including the VICS) can be deleted in long discourses.
The deletion of constituents other than the verb seems to be a device used in thematic
marking in the language—see 1.12.2. See (177) for examples of this type of deletion.
   (3) Deletion of all of the main constituents of a sentence other than the VICS
   All of the main constituents of a sentence other than the VICS can be deleted when a
question is used to respond to a statement (see 1.1.1.2.4.2).

"                                  1.1.2.3.9. Nonfinite relative clauses
Quasi-nonfinite relative clauses occur. They are marked by the use of the
infinitival/participial marker wa instead of the VICS used in finite relative clauses.
Unlike finite relative clauses, in which the INFL morpheme introducing them is optional,
we have no record of quasi-nonfinite clauses occurring without an INFL morpheme
(hence the qualifier ‘quasi’); and unlike finite relative clauses, whose head nouns can
serve as either subject or object of the relative clause, head nouns of nonfinite relative
clauses can appear only as the object of the verb of the subordinate clause. This is
partially responsible for the fact that the infinitival/participial marker wa often receives a
gloss of ‘passive’—see 2.1.3.1.1. Like nonfinite noun clauses, nonfinite relative clauses
are treated morphosyntactically as derived nouns. Examples (126) illustrate nonfinite
relative clauses. The relative clauses are italicized in these examples:

                              1.1.2.4. Verbal modification clauses             1.1.2.4.1. Marking and position of verbal modification clauses
In general, verbal modification clauses take the form of COMP sentence types. There are,
however, many different ways to express verbal modification clauses. The position of
most verbal modification clauses is rigidly fixed by the type of clause: some types always
precede the superordinate clause, while others always follow it. However, two types can
either precede or follow the superordinate clause. Each clause type is treated separately
below.
   Although verbal modification clauses are subordinate to their main clauses, there is
usually a pause and falling intonation between some of them, indicating that they may be
separate sentences. In addition, some main clauses are often left unexpressed, understood
by the context. While this does not make them any less subordinate semantically, it could
again indicate that they are not syntactically subordinate, although more study of their
independent occurrence is needed. This phenomenon is described where relevant in the
subsections below.","[98, 99]"
"1.1.1.2.2.1. Elements of the sentence that can be questioned
1.1.1.2.2.1.1. Constituents of the main clause that can be questioned: Although most ‘ON

and the VIC), the occurrence of one argument (expressed subject, object, indirect object,

locative, instrumental, or temporal phrase) is common. Two or more arguments may also
occur, though rarely. It is, however, possible to construct a (rather unnatural) sentence
with up to four phrases in addition to the verb, as seen in the examples in (14) below:

we have in sentence-initial position the string ma' carawa, which signals that the direct
object is being questioned. The INFL is neuter because the questioner is assuming a
neuter direct object.","[29, 30]"
"                             2.2.4.1.1. Plural/intensive reduplication
Most plural, intense forms of verbs are derived from their singular forms by means of
partial reduplication. This is accomplished either by simply reduplicating the cv of the
stressed syllable once or twice (this process usually takes place with transitive verbs), or
by reduplicating the cv of the stressed syllable with a cvrv pattern (this process usually
takes place with intransitive verbs). There are also many singular and plural pairs of
verbs formed by suppletion. Approximately one third are formed by suppletion, one third
by simply reduplicating the cv of the stressed syllable, and one third by reduplicating
with the cvrv pattern. Note (744e), where the plural, intense form is the base form for a
form of yet greater intensity.

INFL morphemes are often omitted when the verb is reduplicated. This could be either a
morphological fact, that INFL and reduplication are in complementary distribution, but it
seems more likely to have a semantic account, namely that with progressive aspect
marked in reduplication, INFL is unnecessary. INFL is absent in each of the verb-
reduplicated clauses below, where it would have otherwise been expected.

term. The base form represents the sound the object makes. We have described them here
since, as in section 1.1.1.1, onomatopoeic forms are usually verb-like. Note that cucuruc
in (747e) is only partially iterative.

transitive verb, the derived form refers to its object (748a–b); when it is an intransitive

verb, it refers to its subject (748c–d). The example in (748b) could possibly be derived
from the onomatopoeic formative 'ein, the sound this particular frog species makes.

                                         2.2.5.        -derivation
A few cases of verbs derived from nominals (and one derived from a demonstrative)
involve the addition of a glottal (or globalized nasal as in (749a)) to the end of the noun
to derive the verb. No other phonological changes are observed.
(749) a.                            mahweri
                                    ‘deserted field’

                        ‘They abandoned us.’In (750) the verb cawain' ‘to dry’ seems to be derived from the -xi' noun cawaxi' ‘dry
season’. Although we have no record of cawaxi' occurring in an inflected form, cawain
would be its third person neuter inflection.

                                            ‘dry season’

                           ‘To'o pinched me.’In (752), the operator word cain' ‘interrogation’ seems to be derived from the
demonstrative cain ‘that neuter distal’:
(752) a.                           cain
                                   ‘that neuter distal’
(752) b.   Cain'                     ca                        maqui'   xi'              hwe?
           that:n:distal             INFL:nrp/p                come     1pincl:rf        2p:rp/p
           ‘When will you come?’ (lit. ‘When do you (say), ‘We will come”?’)
                     2.2.6. Derivation from verbal inflectional clitics
There are two kinship terms and one verb which might have been derived from verbal
inflectional clitics, although this is still a bit speculative. It seems that the noun na' ‘my
mother’ could be derived from the third person realis past/present VIC na; the noun nem
‘my brother-in-law’ could be derived from the realis past/present VIC na ‘third person
singular’ with the second person singular object, nem ‘third person singular to second
person singular’ respectively; and the verb nam'/nanam' ‘to be pregnant’ could be derived
from the third person singular and/or plural VICS, na and nana, with third person
singular and/or plural objects, -m and vcvm. In the case of na' and nam'/nanam', it could
be said that they are derived by the addition of a glottal, as discussed in 2.2.5. In the case
of nem, it could be said that it is derived via zero-derivation.
    Not only are these terms identical to their basic forms, but the first person plural forms
of na' ‘my mother’, xi' ‘our (inclusive) mother’ and xut ‘our (exclusive) mother’, are
exactly identical to the forms of the first person plural realis future VICS. On the other
hand, this similarity breaks down in the second and third person inflections of na' ‘my
mother’, where the kinship term follows the pattern of regular -xi' nouns: jim ‘your (s)
mother’, jicon ‘his mother’, jicam ‘her mother’, jinain ‘its mother’, juhu' ‘your (p)
mother’, jicocon ‘their (m) mother’, and jicacam ‘their (f) mother’. Nem ‘my brother-in-
law’ inflects for possession like co- kinship terms: conem ma ‘your (s) brother-in-law’,
conem ca ‘his brother-in-law’, etc.
    The literal meanings of the VICS would lead culturally and etymologically quite
naturally to the kinship terms, since these derived forms reflect two of the most important
aspects of the basic social structure of this matriarchal society: that of mother and sister.
‘Mother’ might reasonably be thought of simply as one who is, who exists: ego needs no
special term (noun or verb) to refer to her; she just is, hence the simple use of the third
person singular realis past/present VIC, na ‘he or she (is)’. In like manner, male ego’s
sister is his most honoured and important kin, and he needs no special term to refer to her
                                       Morphology          383
husband. He simply uses the third person singular to second person singular VIC, nem
‘he to you (s)’. As for the verb nam'/nanam' ‘to be pregnant’, the origins (‘he to her’ and
‘them to them feminine’) are also clear.

[t] word-initially. See the discussion following (770).
        voiceless apico-dental plosive and voiceless bilabial trilled plosive occurs as a
single sound word-initially and word-medially. This sound occurs only before /o/ and /Y/.
It sometimes occurs in variation with [t] and is lexically restricted, occurring in only
approximately twenty-five words in our entire corpus. Some idiolects use only [t]. Given
the fact that it is heard almost exclusively from older speakers,       seems to be evolving

                  ‘bee species’Many words, especially monosyllabic words, begin with a glottal plosiveconsonant
sequence, involving plosives, affricates and nasals. In these words, the glottal plosive-
consonant sequence fluctuates with the single consonant of the respective sequences, and
we analyse the        sequence as an allophone variant of the relevant c. In addition, a
glottal plosive always precedes word-initial semivowels, even in polysyllabic words.
   There seems to be some correlation between words beginning with a glottal-consonant
sequence in the 'Oro Nao' dialect and words that, in other dialects ('Oro Waram, 'Oro
Mon, 'Oro Waram Xijein, 'Oro 'At) begin with         : com            ‘water’, te       ‘my
father’, xa'        ‘my younger sibling’, and jin'           ‘to be afraid’, in the 'Oro Nao'
dialect are 'acom              , 'ate        , 'axa'            , and 'ajin'          in the
other dialects. This correlation, however, is not consistent throughout the language: jowin
             ‘monkey species’, waram                     ‘monkey species’, and pi
‘thorn’ are pronounced the same in all dialects.

   In some idiolects, especially of children, word-final glottal plosives, glottalized nasals,
and glottal-consonant sequences are not pronounced at all. Adults’ pronunciation is
variable. Adults and children always pronounce word-initial glottal plosives preceding
vowels at the beginning of a word and usually intervocalically within words (although
glottal stop is sometimes replaced by length on the preceding vowel or following
consonant). Adults are fairly consistent in pronouncing word final glottal plosives and
glottalized nasals.

Although there are no obligatory number distinctions on nouns, there are four ways
(optionally) to mark number on them.
   (1) There is a set of collective markers or particles that can precede nouns to express
the general notion of plurality. 'Oro is the most common. It can appear optionally with all
common nouns, even on collective nouns (546d).

                                   ‘all the children’There are four other collective particles that have a limited, complementary distribution.
They indicate a specific group. Waram can occur with the first person singular inflection
of kinship terms, as in waram te ‘my fathers’; mon occurs with the word tarama’ ‘man’;
oromon occurs with the words xojam' ‘young girl’ and horon ‘old person’; and mana can
occur with the second and third person singular and plural inflections of co-kinship terms,
as well as some common nouns. See (547) below, where the use of mana with common
nouns illustrates the difference between 'oro as a general plural marker and the other
collective particles as specific group markers. Although 'oro and mana may appear with
the same noun, 'oro does not appear together with waram, mon, or 'oromon with the same
nouns—see 1.2.5.2.6.

inflectional clitics (548a), possessive morphemes (548b) or on an inflected preposition
(548c), this device is very restricted, because only human nouns can be marked this way
(compare (548d) and (548e)), and they are also normally marked by other means—see
2.1.1.8.3(1, 3–5). See 2.1.1.8.3(4) on how to mark the number of nonhuman nouns.

have a less intense, or singular, and a more intense, or plural form. The number of the
subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive verbs is marked via the use of the
more intense, or plural form. So although the plural number of a nonhuman noun is not
marked on the VIC, if the verb has an intense, or plural form, the number of the subject
or object can nevertheless be marked by its use—see 2.1.1.9.3.

"Both pre- and postverbal modifiers can accompany the same verb. It is rare, however, to
find more than one of each in a single sentence. Two postverbal modifiers can occur in a
single VP if they are merely modifiers in an adverbial sense; however, no more than one
postverbal modifier that is contributing to the expression of an oblique object may occur
in one VP -see 1.2.1.2.4.

context. The use of ne, pane and pacara pane is relative to the thoughts of the speaker,
whether the action is considered to be recent, slightly remote or very remote.

"                                2.1.4. Nominal modification
Nominal modification, expressed in many languages via adjectives, is expressed in ‘ON
by nouns (but see 1.2.5.2.5, for a discussion of demonstratives which could possibly be
considered adjectives). Attributive modification is handled like a possessive phrase: the
first syntactically nominal element occurs with a genitive morpheme (nominal
inflectional clitic or suffix) and is understood as modifying the second noun. These
genitive nominal elements can have the form of derived nouns (641a) or -xi' nouns
(641b). In addition, one derived kinship term can also be glossed as a modifier (641c).

                                       modification
When a modified element is realized as a (surface) verb, the modification is predicative.
When the modifier is realized as a (surface) noun, the modification is attributive. There
are a few -xi' nouns that inflect only for third person (first and second person may not be
used for possession with these particular -xi' nouns); these words use the same form for
predicative and attributive modification.
(643) a.              Wijimain                              na                    xirim.

In all other cases, there is a distinction between predicative and attributive forms of
modification as follows:
   (1) In -xi' nouns, the first person singular form functions as the complement to a
copula (predicative), whereas attributive modification is expressed by the third person
inflection.

Benefactive NPS are licensed by the verb mi' ‘to give’, appearing as the last member of a

There is no instrumental case. Instrument is expressed by the preverbal modifier mam
‘instrument’. The element with which it is related occurs in a prepositional phrase
following the direct object of the verb.
(396)            Mam             wac         'inon                          hwam            pain                 quit.

                 ‘I cut the fish with a knife.’Instrument may be expressed without mam, although this is much less common:
(397)             ?Wac                 'inon                         hwam                 pain                  quit.

                  ‘I cut the fish with a knife.’Negative instrument must be expressed by negating a positive instrumental statement,
followed by a parallel positive statement. Instrumental, as the preverbal modifier mam
and a prepositional phrase, may occur in both statements.

Comitative is expressed by the verb jajao ‘together’. The comitative NP is its direct
object.

Comitative is also expressed by a compound verb, in which jajao precedes the verb root.
When this happens, the comitative NP must appear in a prepositional phrase. This may be
due to the fact that the addition of another verb adds a goal argument, though covert in
the examples in our corpus. On the other hand, this is somewhat speculative, because
there are no examples in the corpus of jajao occurring with a goal when compounded
with another verb, whether intransitive or transitive, and the example in (400b) was said
to be ungrammatical by a native speaker. At this point, we do not have a final account of

‘It is good that we be together pleasantly.’Comitative is also expressed by the postverbal modifier wi ‘together’ in a compound
verb. While there is no evidence in the corpus that a compound verb with wi can occur
with a direct object marked on the VIC, we do not believe it would be ill-formed to mark
the direct object on the VIC, as in (401b) and (401d).

coordination—see 1.3.3(4), examples (274).

Circumstance is also expressed by the preverbal modifier mam (see instrumental—
2.1.1.4.3), but unlike instrumental, the element with which it is related cannot occur in a
prepositional phrase. It must be referenced on the object portion of the VIC—see
1.2.1.2.3. The examples below would only be grammatical under a bizarre instrumental

Possessive is marked on the possessed element. It is expressed three ways, each of which
applies to a separate class of nouns:
   (1) The class of possession marking suffixes inflects for person, number, and third
person gender on the bound form of all -xi' nouns, which are inalienably possessed. The
paradigm of possession marking suffixes is as follows (each of these suffixes has
allomorphs that are phonologically conditioned—see discussion and examples in 3.4):
first singular                                                                         -0
second singular                                                                        -m
third singular masculine                                                               -con

third plural feminine                                                 -cacamMost -xi' nouns also have free forms, some of which make up a class of nonpossessed
nouns (they cannot be possessed—see 2.1.1.4.6.1), and others of which, together with all
other unpossessed nouns, can be possessed by:
   (2) The class of nominal inflectional clitics that also inflect for person, number, and
third person gender. None of these NICS has allomorphs. The paradigm of NICS is
identical in function and phonologically similar to the possessive suffixes described
above. It is as follows:
first singular                                                        ne
second singular                                                       nem
third singular masculine                                              nucun

third neuter                                                          nein
first plural inclusive                                                nexi'
first plural exclusive                                      nuxut
second plural                                               nuhu'
third plural masculine                                      nucucun
third plural feminine                                       nequequem(3) The Tenseless verbal inflectional clitics mark possession on co' kinship terms—see
the discussion and examples in 2.2.2.2.1.5.
   2.1.1.4.6.1. Alienable and inalienable possession Co- kinship terms, derived from
relative clauses (see 2.2.2.2.1.5), are inalienably possessed, as are -xi' nouns, so-called
because their citation form ends with the suffix -xi' ‘first person plural inclusive’. Most -
xi' nouns have free alternate forms which can be divided into two classes: (1)
nonpossessed forms, which cannot be possessed; and (2) unpossessed forms, which are
accepted by some speakers in alienable possession. The nonpossessed class of nouns
consists of words for body parts: 'at ‘bone’, waji' ‘head’, caxim ‘foot’, jat ‘tooth’, 'ut
‘nose’. Possession of words in this class of nouns must be expressed by the inflection of
their -xi' forms, rather than their free forms:

                                  ‘your (pl) heads’There is some question as to whether the class of unpossessed nouns, that have -xi'
alternate forms, is truly possessable. A few of them have been found in the corpus
((409c) is one example), occurring with the possession marking NICS, but some
informants have said that the use of NICS with these unpossessed forms is
ungrammatical, and that their use is the result of outside pressure from persons who do
not speak the language well. Of the pairs of examples below, (a) is preferred to (b).

insects, trees), as well as names of people. Possession is marked on this class of nouns by
the NICS listed above. Many animals and birds, especially significant game animals and
birds, have -xi' forms, by means of which possession is preferably marked—see the
preceding examples.

"                          0.1.2. Syllable structure and prosody
'ON has cv and cvc syllables, the coda position of the latter being restricted in the number
of consonants which may appear in it. Only /n/ may appear in the coda of cvc in word-
medial position and only four other consonants, i.e. in addition to /n/, may appear in this
position word-finally. This produces (15×6×6 =) 540 total possible syllables for all
positions of the word, much greater than many Amazonian languages (e.g. Madi
(Arawan) with 47–50 possible syllables across dialects and Pirahã (Mura) with 108
possible syllables).
   Primary sentence stress appears on the final syllable of the verb (or penultimate
syllable if the final syllable is a stress-avoiding verb). There are some interesting vowel
harmony processes and stress interactions in the language but, by and large, the
phonology is relatively simple formally. In spite of all our work on segmental
phonological analysis, however, there are still numerous aspects that we do not yet fully
understand. We as yet have no account, for example, as to why /kw/ and /hw/ cannot be
followed by rounded vowels. In the light of the fact that k/h+o/u/ov sequences can
sometimes be realized as kwv/hwv, we are tempted to analyse [kw] and [hw] as allophones
of /k/ and /h/, respectively. Still, though, there are minimal pairs which we would then be
unable to explain. Moreover, there are many cases of [kw] and [hw] which would violate

canonical syllable structures of 'ON if analysed as k/h+rounded vowel. Therefore, we
have treated them here as separate consonant phonemes.","[14, 15]"
