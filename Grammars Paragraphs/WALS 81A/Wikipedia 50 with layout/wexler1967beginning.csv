phrase.        e.g.,'what?            what     color?’          The    presence          of    -sa precludes           the

It     is    not       necessary            to       insert         a negative               infix        in      the     participle.

which        may     be    attached            to     the        subject              of     the    sentence             (nouns,              pronouns,
adjectives)               or     to     the    object            of    a     verb           phrase.          Thus       Maria             suma
tawakowa            is    also        possible.              The       precise               function         of       the        optional
marker        is presently                unclear.                Possibly                  it is a stylistic                       device        which
does     not        signal        any     difference                  in     referential               meaning.                   Words        ending
in    a vowel            take     the     marker           in     the        form          -jja     (Maria         +     jjia),         words
ending        in a consonant                   or -e         (in       Spanish               words)     take           the marker                in the
form     ~ajja           (David + ajia,                   Jose        + ajia).                (On     the     loss           of     the       final
vowel,        cf     section           LiI     below.)                When        the        subject         of    the        sentence
comprises            a modified               noun,        the        marker           is     added     to        the        last       component
of    the     subject:

The    same        marker         may     also       be      attached                 to     adverbs        and        verbs:           in     the
case     of    the        latter,             the     function              appears            to be        grammatical                      rather      than
stylistic.                These        other        uses        will        be        discussed         in        later           chapters.","[24, 25, 26, 27]"

LESSON          ITGrammar          -        Suma     parlafataquiI.   Nayan_amigojjajj                          wali _suma            jakewa.                'My     friend           is     a very               nice         man.'
     Possession                    is expressed               by     the addition                   of a suffix                   to        the noun.
     The possessive                       personal            pronoun            may        also be added                   to distinguish
     Singular                and        plural       possession.
          e.g.             Amigopajj           ch'iqhiwa.                  ‘His     (her)           friend           is     intelligent:'

                          Ambiguity            is    removed          by the            addition               of the possessive
                          pronoun:             jupan          ‘his (her)'/jupanacan                                 'their'
     There            are         8 pronominal               forms,        distinguished                       by number               but        not      by
     gender.                 There        are       4 numbers          which           are        formally            marked:                    singular,
     dual,            dual         plural,          and      plural.
     1.         The         dual        form     includes            the     speaker              and         one    interlocutor                       (I and you)
     2.         The         plural        of     the      dual       indicates              the         speaker            and     more           than         one
                     interlocutor                (you plural               and     I)

I.   The Aymara           verbal         system       is characterized                   by     aspect        (manner        in     which the action                  is completed)             and tense           (time when the action
     is    completed).             Verbs        which        express        completed               action        or call     attention           to a specific               point      in time       are        called        punctual         verbs:     verbs       which     express             incompleted          action     are        called         durative           verbs.
