"Santandrea, The Birri Language221The usage of this adverb is extremely wide, serving to qualify ad­
jectives and verbs, and to translate such phrases as “a great deal, in
great quantity”, etc. Examples:
uma-db awii akpasha this man runs much, i.e. fast; atone, akpaca they
are very many; undha akpaca (there is) plenty of durrah; uma-db awu
ids akpasha this man knows things much, i.e. is very learned.
(6) A note on ma
This short note, only incidentally connected with the superlative, is
given here, though its proper place should be, perhaps, in the chapter
on Nouns. Serious doubts, however, prevent me from deciding about
its nature. According to my informants, it originally means “mother”,
but, as it happens in some cases in Zande, it is used as an augmentative
affix, denoting “big, much”. E.g.: wuu-ma big water (often applied to
rivers); kpi-ma a big tree; ngbadi-ma a big net.
As far as adjectives are concerned, I have reasons to suspect that
big, great ukama, is a compound adj., made up of (u)ka + ma. If that
were true, ma would be related to Ndogo ma (cf. my Ndogo, p. 92,
99, etc.).
VII. The Predicative ConstructionsThe subject is so complicated that I thought it convenient to divide
and subdivide it in many sections, in order to draw some guiding
conclusions: “guiding conclusions”, not “rules”.
1. TO BE = COPULA(1) With nouns and pronouns
a)
Subject and predicate = nouns
Normally no copula is employed. We frequently find a, already
mentioned when dealing with nouns (2. Number). Though euphony
can be invoked to explain its presence, it cannot be denied that a also
fulfills a linking function, a feature common to many languages of the
western Bahr el Ghazal and adjoining territories: Ndogo and Bongo
groups, etc. As a rule, I have joined a to the word to which it is actually
joined in pronunciation.
vundumai (= vundumanye) aviri our tribe is Birri; iju-db aviri this
woman is Birri; mad gamaye avuru tens kirikpa “we ourselves (= as for
us) (are) subject their(s) simply”; bufe umd (bu-)gd-do “his father (is)
man that-there”.
15
Afrika und Cbersee, Band XLIX/3—1965222Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIXEspecially when other words follow the subject, yi, yini is frequently
used. It is the pers. pron. 3rd pers. which fulfills manyfold functions
in Birri.
umd-db (y)e gbaya this man is Zande; pl. umd-db mugu (y)ine gbaya.
b)
Subject = pronoun + predicate = noun
Generally speaking, we find the same construction as for a).
md ulu I (am) a man; md nvure sa “I (am) a beast not”; omuye ulu gd
(e)dekpo “you (pl.) (are) men of iron” (viz. riches: You are rich men);
yi o’u he (is) a chief; pl. (y)ini ju.
For the 3rd pers. pl., ene, sue, ene occasionally replace the more
common form yini, (y)ini...: ene ulu-ga-gbdmvi “they (are) men-ofleprosy” (they are lepers).
The phrase so often heard in speech, “it is ...”, is translated by
means of (y)i, yini: It is I i md; it is we in(i) amanye; it is a man (y)e
ulu; it is a beast yi nvure.
On occasions, only the noun is said, in order to lay emphasis on the
statement: Ui I (it is a) lie!
(2) With adjectives
Normally neither verb nor copula is used, but yi, yini is fairly often
employed, though it can be dropped at will. When the English copula
approaches the meaning of “being living, being found”, yi, yini is
seldom missing: anjange ina ebb wdwu the Dinka are far from Wau;
anjange ins tere the Dinka are near.
a)
Subject = noun 4- predicate — adjective
(The sentences quoted in the previous chapter are given only in Birri.)
umd-db akpa-dd, pl. umd-db mugu akpa-ne da. Neg. sing, umd-db akpacd, pl. ulu mugu akpa-ne-cd. — kpi-db ukdmd.
(The following examples are taken from VI, (4) “Special adjectives
translated by means of phrases”): tyuye ofblrbl tyufe otro-shd', tyumd
erne akpasa.
Is the cloth white ? vbngb fu(u) ? Yes = vbngb fu(u). The man is old umddb ogboro; pl. umd-db mugu-ne ine (Q^gboro (pr. ina gborv). This goat is a
male inyi-db b'u. Is the hoe of the small child new ? nvaraga ga ym ngu
^ya-tre^. Yes i ^ya-fre. No i ^ya fre-shd.
b) Subject = pronoun (expressed or silent) + predicate = adjective
yi, yini is normally employed, that is more frequently than with a),
unless the construction requires (re (= /e), fine after the adj.
They are many ini agbb (pr. indgbo). He is big i kpbkpb. It is black
i ndi (= ndyi}. It is not big ukama fe-shd.","[51, 52, 53]"
"212Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIXb) (a)yi + g(a) + verb. Phonetical variations are often met:
(a)ye instead of (a)yi and k(a) instead of g(a).
[As to this double prefix, I think it to be, originally, the same as that
employed to introduce “reported speech” (see above: IV, 1, iii), which
means “say that”. Thus, e.g. the phrase “he will go, they will go”,
would literally mean: he says that he goes, they say that they go.]
I shall come mayi g-and. I shall go to Wau (after) three days mayi g-awd
gu Wau gbe vkofro. He will come just now ayi g-dnd 6e6e-db. We will
come all to-morrow mayi g-ana (a)fe amundri. They will come to­
morrow ayine g-dnd amundri. He will go home aye g-awd gu md. Rain
will fall just now (e)ndri ayi g-ddi 6e6e-db.
Exceptions are by no means lacking, and some contain interesting
constructions which shed light on Birri syntax:
ayani-ka\ g-awane wetuu (pr. wutyuu) they said: They will (or would)
go to the field. Here, as the verb introducing the “reported speech”
sounds almost the same as (a)yi, this first element of the future has
been omitted.
[An alternative translation of the above sentence runs as follows:
ayani -ka: n-awa g-ana (pr. g-ane) gu we-tyuu. Here we noticethat the two
verbs following ga are in the “reverse” order, according to “western”
standards. In fact awa means “to go” and ana “to come”, meaning
together “start to go”, a construction which is quite normal, e.g. in
Yulu-Biqa, in which even three verbs are often “associated” (this being
the terminology I have adopted in my Yulu MS) in “reverse” order.]
In statements in which a fact is given as certain, either past-present
or future may be used: It will finish (in) three days gbe (=day) okofro
ari-da = ayi g-ari da. — Note that, even in the Future, the final particle
da is employed, though it actually belongs to the Past.
[Noteworthy is the following sentence: ngbanga-db ayi ari (pr. aye-ri)
da ga gbaya 6a this suit (a court case) is going to finish (i.e. to be settled)
by the chief. Here only ayi is used, ga having been omitted (possibly on
account of the other ga that follows), and da appears again, though it is
usually employed only in the past-present. There are no rules without
exceptions; and can we after all call rules certain frequent repetitions
of features in a language of which we have only a very limited know­
ledge?]
Examples with referring pronouns.
He said: He will eat porridge to-morrow ayi-ka\ n-ayi-ga ga d6b onyo
amundri (n-ayi-ga is actually pronounced nayegd). Pl. ayini-ka: nd-yigd-ni ga a6b dnyo amundri.","[42, 43]"
"Santandrea, The Birri Language83Makere etc. (according to de Calonne), the Moru-Madi-LugbaraAbukaya-Logo and the Bongo-group, including the Kresh subgroup
(with Aja). Moreover there exists some relationship — too extensive to
be casual — between Birri and the Ndogo-group, and, though in a lesser
degree, the Feroge-group as well.
As a matter of fact, it has been the importance of Birri for compa­
rative studies of the Sudanic languages of this area that has persuaded
me to put into shape the following notes and have them published,
though I am aware of their many and not negligeable shortcomings.
My informantsThe Birri are divided in two well-distinct sections: the Mboto and
the Munga, probably speaking different dialects. This information,
which I gathered at Deim Zubeir, was later on confirmed by a confrere
of mine, who gathered it independently, in a faraway district.
My informants, belonging to the Mboto, were all, except one, ex­
tremely backward, and unwilling to speak their own language, to
which they prefered Zande. It was only by dint of sheer efforts and
kind contrivances that I succeeded in getting in touch with them for
short periods of time. Luckily enough, later on I was able to check my
material with a more willing tribesman. All the same my warm thanks
are tendered to them, or, rather, to their memory; for by now all of
them have passed away.
Directions about Birri and English texts
a) The English translation is strictly literal and words are in the
same order as in the native text, though English style and ears may
suffer heavily from such a measure. The reason is obvious: in many
books of this kind the reader cannot find out the correspondent words
in the two texts. Only in exceptional cases a double translation is
given, that is when the first would not be otherwise understood. What
has been said about English translations applies also, partly, to English
texts proposed for translation into Birri.
b) A word in parenthesis in English means that it is missing in the
native language.
c) On the other hand, a word missing in the correct English transla­
tion is given between inverted commas, whenever it is thought con­
venient to point out its presence in the Birri text.
d) Any letter given in parenthesis means that it can be left out in
pronunciation.

Add here the sentences given under the heading Conditional.

lows. (See, e.g. what has been said about the Imperative of Command.)

ara-ga-ra1 ‘they said: their hands pain’ ’. Is ga a special plural affix, or the
future prefix indicating that the pain is going to continue (in the future),
or is the whole an idiomatic phrase defeating any logical explanation?]
Reduplication of adjectives
In order to avoid repetition, we anticipate here a matter that partly
belongs to the next chapter.
Though reduplication plays a wider role in verbal adjectives, which
might be classified as verbs and should therefore be dealt with in this
chapter, it is also found in non-verbal ones. As numerous examples will
be seen in the next chapters, only a few are quoted here:
Long 6ko(k6): maga kpi okoko I felled a long (= tall) tree
Bigw^re: (^re) kpiudredre the tree(is)big; agakpiudredreieW (cut) a big tree.
Acidun{ri): mdya ydum sa I do not drink acid beer; ifu akpdsa ana
n (= re) yd unn the bad women brought (= came with) acid beer.
In Birri reduplication is often optional. It is preferably employed in
the plural. E.g.:
big ukama
Negative: ukama-sha
pl. ukakama Negative: ukakama-sha.
iv. Questions and answersThis brief collection, besides fulfilling its specific purpose, serves to
illustrate further the items seen above and to get a little deeper insight
into the types of Birri constructions.","[47, 48]"
"Consonant combinations containing v or b: mb, mv, nv:
The uncertainty, indeed the inconsistency, noticed above, also reigns
here. Only a few examples are given:
Stool mbata. The word is borrowed from Zande, and pronounced after
the Zande way.
Potato aramba = aramva.
(A kind of) vegetable mbvald. Here the pronunciation mbv agrees per­
fectly with Ndogo-Sere.
[In connection with nv and mv, I am not in a position to state
whether there is a clear-cut distinction between them, or not. Therefore
in these notes I used either nv or mv, according to what seemed to me
the actual pronunciation of the individual informant of the moment.]
2. DENTALS AND ALVEOLARS (cf. WW 151—160)dental, as in Ndogo, etc. and in Italian: unlike the English and
Nilotic t of Dinka and Jur-Luo.
dy
a single sound: palatal d. Though not exactly the same, it is
pronounced almost as in English dew. An example in Birri:
kadyi knife.
d
= d preceded by the glottal stop. In some cases (the fact may
be due to variation of dialects) it sounds rather as a retroflex d.
Examples: 5d6 to build; di mine (1st pers. sing, possessive inti­
mate).
[Of all the languages I know, Baka has the nearest sound to Birri
di.}
4
a special kind of retroflex d (different, e.g. from that found in
d92Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIXKresh and Golo), it is followed by an “initial” r. Examples:
bird uda; beads dgidbdr
a retroflex d followed by a clear r. This sound is closely related
to the preceding one. A parallel sound is found in Baka.
t
dental t. See above d. E.g.: year utu.
ty
a single sound: palatal t. (See above dy.) Examples: utyi field
rat; utyi meat (or sauce); tyu to be, in.
I
& special kind of retroflex t, followed by and “initial” r. (See
above d-) Examples: rain season
“a form of the verb to
be” fe.
fr
a retroflex t followed by a clear r. E.g.: ufre (a) fly; o/ro seed.
An (almost) equivalent sound is also found in Baka.
Interdental dh and th
dh
is pronounced as th in English this, that, thus differing slightly
from the Nilotic dh, as found in Dinka and Jur-Luo. In most
cases it is preceded by n. Examples: dho oil; indhi fish; undha
durrah; undhi fowl.
I heard, however, some Birris pronounce dz instead of dh.
th
is pronounced as th in English thing, thirst, thus differing con­
siderably from the Nilotic th, as found in Dinka and Jur-Luo.
Examples: Ngothu God; kethra a kind of big pot.
I heard, however, some speakers pronounce ts (as in Italian ragazza)
instead of th.1)
nh
(8b single sound) interdental n, pronounced more or less as in
Nilotic languages, with the addition of nasalisation, owing to
which in my first draft of these notes I had adopted the spelling
nh. But I am rightly afraid that such a symbol would be mis­
leading for many readers. Suffice it to note, once for ever, that
this kind of n, besides being interdental, is also nasal.
Alveolar-liquid consonants
Iv.r In order to avoid confusion, 1 has been adopted, as noted in the
Alphabet, for the interchangeable I and r (a feature shared in
common with Zande, as spoken in the Sudan), and r for the real
r, moderately rolled as in Ndogo, etc. and Italian. Examples:
x) This set of interdentals is quite a noticeable feature, which I thought
unique in the Bahr el Ghazal and adjoining areas of former Belgian and French
Congo, until I discovered it also in Kare. (See my Shobt Notes on the Bodo,
Huma and Kare Languages in S.N.R., XLIV, 1963, p. 83.) Interdependence
between them is quite possible, as Birri and Kare live side by side; but a study
on this subject would entail a complex amount of research beyond my compe­
tence (Kare is a semi-Bantu language) and possibility.","[12, 13]"

Birri
PartIntroductionThe tribeThe Birri are not marked in the maps of the earliest travellers:
Schweinfurth’s (1870—72), Potagos’ (1876—77), Buchta’s. As far as I
am aware, their name appeared for the first time in Junker-Casati’s
map, drawn by F. Gessi, the son of the famous Pasha, Romolo (1880—
88). The tribe’s name is marked just south of 6' latitude north, between
25 and 26 longitude east, on the left side of the river Warra. De CalonneBeaufaict, in “Azande” (published in 1921) places the Birri in the same
spot, as does the British War Office map 1933, spelling, however, their
name Biri. (Personally I have no doubt that, after the serious work of
the first cartographers, the others have contented themselves with
copying the already existing maps: for instance, villages called after
chiefs’ names, are sometimes marked twice in different places!)
I have published all the information I was able to gather on this tribe
in an extremely short article, in S.N.R. (Sudan Notes and Records,
Khartoum, vol. XXXI, Part 1,1950, pp. 54—60). I could get no official
data from governments offices of the then Oubangui-Chari (or UbangiShari) Province of French Equatorial Africa, now Central African
Republic. A traveller in the years 1910—11 speaks of 4,500 Birri
6
Afrika und tJbersee, Band XLIX/2 —196582Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIXliving in the Rafai territory.1) Judging from what has happened to
other small local tribes, now they are presumably reduced to about a
third or even less. A few more Birri live scattered in the Obo territory,
to the east of Rafai.
In 1950 there were seven Birri taxpayers in Deim Zubeir, Bahr el
Ghazal Province, Sudan, thus less than thirty souls in all: the remnants
of a group of runaways from the Central African Republic.2)The name
In order to avoid misunderstandings, I have adopted the commonest
spelling: Birri. The spelling Biri, too, is sometimes found in maps, as
already noted. In their language, the name is pronounced VM, with
middle tones and even accents in both syllables. The prevailing pro­
nunciation with the initial b is most probably due to Zande influence
(I know, in fact, of other similar cases). The double r, instead, is not
justified by any reason within my knowledge, but is welcome as a fait
accompli, •for it serves to distinguish this name from the nearly homo­
graphic one of the tribe of the Ndogo group: the (Belanda-)Bviri,
whose name is often spelt Biri. The difference of pronunciation be­
tween the two words is actually rather slight, for the latter, in their
own language, is pronounced Vin, with a high tone in the second
syllable, on which alone lies the “accent” or “stress” of the word.","[1, 2, 3]"
"“Referring forms” for the 3rd persons in “reported speech”(cf. Tucker, p. 139, n. 198 ...).
These forms are used only to refer back to the speaker(s), or to the
subject just previously mentioned. The construction is tentatively
called “reported speech”, for it is neither direct speech nor the ordi­
nary indirect one.
Sing, ni (but the final vowel is usually lost on account of the initial
vowel of the following word)
Pl. ni -f- ni (= ne), the plural suffix, in its proper place.
In most cases verbs or verb-like adjectives follow, and then the plur.
suffix is attached to them; thus it seldom follows immediately the
pronoun stem.
He said: He is Zande ayi-kd: ni kd gbaya; pl. ayini-kd: ni kd ne gbaya.
He said: He is Birri ayi-kd: nika (= ga) aviri', pl. ayini-ka-. ni ka ne
aviri.
Negation: ayi-kd: ni kd aviri sa; pl. ayini-kd: ni gdne aviri sd.
The referring pronouns will be seen at work when dealing with the
conjugation of verbs, and their derivatives will be found when dealing
with the pronominal affixes in general, and in particular in connection
with the possessive pronouns and adjectives.
Here only a sample of the forthcoming examples is given: He said:
He is going to the field ayi-kd: n-awa kd (gu) (u)we tyu; pl. ayini-kd:
n-awa kd-ne ... Nginzo said: He (himself) made it Nginzo ayi-kd: nadhe gd nii (or, simply n-adhe da); pl. ayini-ka: n-adhene da.
[The Birri “referring” pronoun is reminiscent of Bongo, in which na
is employed for the singular; for the plural, however, the ordinary form
is used (cf. my Bongo, n. 32, p. 32). A similar form (ne, na ...) can
be detected also in Yulu, Kara and Aja, but in none of these languages
do we find such a clear-cut distinction between the ordinary form and
the “referring” as in Birri, Ndogo, Zande, etc. ...]203Santandrea, The Birri Languageiv. The neuter pronouna) In many cases it is omitted. This is the general rule when, in the
corresponding English translation, it is the subject of the sentence. E.g.:
(Is it) good? akpa-dd? (It is) good akpa-dd.
(It is) not good akpa-sa. (Is it) enough ? liki-da? Yes liki-dd.
No liki-sa. (It) fell (and it) broke ede-dd, ayi-dd (lit. “it died”).
The neuter pronoun is frequently overlooked also when, in the
English translation, it corresponds to the object. E.g.: Fix (it) ila-ila.
In some cases only the previous context, or occasionally gestures
made by the speaker, will provide the clue to understand what the
pronoun (both referred to things and animals) should indicate. E.g.:
mo nvu, adrd-dd lit. “you catch, ... run-away”, a sentence meaning, in
this particular case: “catch (or hold) the goats, unless they run away”.
b)
In other cases, the personal pronoun is used for the neuter:
as subject: anvu ngbangba, efe ede “hold it, lest it falls”.
as object. The two first examples show fe as object of a preposition:
ddi bu-db, ari tarabeza (Ar.) re fe “take this (and) clean the table with
it”; ddi uwe, ede re fe “take and sweep thing (= the place, the room)
with it”. In the following sentence fe stands for an animal: meme fe,
(i)re ami (pr. irami) “I beat it, (it) is crying” (speaking, e.g. of a dog).
2. REFLEXIVE AND RECIPROCALi. ReflexiveThe examples available are all in the third person. The reflexive is
made as follows: sing, ro + ye + ni; the plural suffix (ne, ni) follows all
the parts of speech that allow it. This man killed himself umd-db awi
rb-ye ni. This (or the) old woman killed herself iju ogboro awi rb-ye ni.
Those men killed themselves umd-db mugu-ne awi-ne ro-ye-ne. Those
two women killed themselves iju mugu ukware awi-ne ro-ye-ne.
ii. ReciprocalIt is the same as the Reflexive, with the exception of the final ni,
which is missing in the Reciprocal. They insult one another odone
ro-ye-ne. They beat one another emene ro-ye-ne.
Here, for the sake of clarity, the elements forming the reflexive and
reciprocal pronouns have been joined by means of a hyphen; but in
ordinary writing they had better be spelt as one word (e.g. royene).","[33, 34]"

The distinction between subject and object forms in the 3rd person
is generally kept, but exceptions are not lacking. E.g.: tene anani kaBb
nyine “they came late they-themselves”. The use of tene, in this par­
ticular case, may be due to the emphasis laid on the pronoun.
[The plural suffix (ne, ni) for the 3rd person is common to Aja (cf.
my Aja MS.).]

"Santandrea, The Birri Language209E.g.: To sow durrah undha uwi. To sow sesame (by spreading it) aya
ayu.
To beat (a) man ulu amd. To steal idi dv. To eat porridge aba ony5. To
build (a) house dhara avi. To brew beer (a^ya ae.
The same construction is also used in dependent clauses:
He went to wash clothes awa vongo am. We go to help him mawd /e
(him) ’du.
b) object + g{a) + verb ... {ga, as prefix of the infinitive, forms a
noticeable point of resemblance between Birri and Kresh).
E.g.: To steal ide g-dgi. To eat ide g-onyo. To dig (a) hole vu g-d-di. To
dress vong6 gosha lit. “clothes to dress”.
(2) Intransitive verbs
The verb stem functions as infinitive, as will be seen in several ex­
amples given in the coming paragraphs.
(3) When the infinitive is used as the subject of a sentence, thus func­
tioning as a verbal noun, any of the constructions mentioned above
may be employed. E.g.:

hunger make (is) of women”. To build (a) house is men’s (work) dhara
adhe g{a) uma. To be lazy is bad ddi kirikpa akpa-ca lit. “to sit with-noreason, viz. idly, good not”. To steal is bad ide (thing) 6’6 (to steal)
akpa-ca. To kill is bad ulu (man) awl (to kill) akpa-sha.
Occasionally, however, g{a) + verb stem are used. E.g.:
g-iki kb-um adn ma da lit. “To cross to-the-other-side (of a river) de­
feats me”; ga wuu afuu (pr. gaufuu) ofrosa “to swim hard-not”.
(4) When the infinitive follows a verb, of which it acts as object or the
like, two constructions are available:
a)
Governing verb -f- object (if any) + infinitive:
He began to build the house (the thatch) ye are dhara 6d6. They came
to build my house anane dhara-ma 6d6.
b) The simple indicative mood is used. E.g.: Tell the boys to work ala
rende adhene thunge lit. “tell boys they make work”.
Of course, there are numberless examples that escape this artificial
classification. E.g.: Call the boy (and tell him) to fetch water unghama
rends, ekt md {u)wuu lit. “call me boy, fetch me water”.

for the average reader.
For details, both theoretical and practical, I shall refer to WW.]
II. A few Observations on Orthography in general
1. DIVISION OF SYLLABLES AND WORDSThe first point applies to syllables in the same word, the second to
words in the same phrase or sentence. Such a division, which must
perforce follow “grammar” in writing, often does not agree at all with
pronunciation. This feature is not unknown in Sudanic languages in the
Mbomu-Bahr el Ghazal Basin, being particularly prominent in YuluBiga-Kara, languages of the Bongo-group. Examples will explain:
field of the man adha ga ulu pr. adhagu lu. Clean (it) with a cloth (u)we
ri vongo pr. uwere vongo. The man is inside umd i da(v)vaka pr. umd-ida
(v)vaka. What is your (pl.) tribe? vundugu tyu ya2 pr. vundu gufyu ya2
The chief’s children are five Ju goo nyigila pr. o’u gwnyi gild.
2. VARIATIONS OF SOUNDS AND CONSEQUENTLY OF SPELLINGThis second point concerns mostly vowels; details will be explained
further on. Throughout these notes I have endeavoured to adhere, on
principle, as close as possible to the actual pronunciation of the natives,
even if that meant a certain inconsistency in the spelling; for the same
words are apt to change in pronunciation according to the varying of
grammatical and phonetical contexts. To these we should add the
variations due to the different speakers, belonging to different sections
or clans. I have refrained, however, from altering the spelling whenever
such a change might have proved misleading. In several cases, to avoid
confusion or misunderstanding, I have respelt the word or words,
placing the abbreviation pr. before it, or them.
Changes of vowels in detail are illustrated in the next chapter.
III. Vowels
1. VARIOUS NOTES ON PRONUNCIATION AND SPELLINGa) Euphonic initial vowels
At the beginning of a word, or, more exactly, “before” a word, a
vowel is often pronounced which does not belong to the word itself.
This takes place especially at the beginning of a sentence or phrase. It
is euphony that requires it; and euphony is a factor which can be88Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIXhardly overvalued in many Sudanic languages, especially in the
western Bahr el Ghazal and adjoining territories: e.g. in the BongoKresh groups. Sometimes such a vowel is so frequently heard that one,
if not sufficiently acquainted with the language, is at loss to decide
whether it belongs to the word stem or is simply an euphonic initial
vowel. These vowels have been normally placed in brackets.
b) Elision
Vowels are fairly frequently elided at the beginning and at the end of
words. Such vowels are placed in brackets:
Man ulu; man’s head (u)lu-dru. Boy = rende-(u}md. One day mddi (i)la.
Two days mdd(i) ukwari pr. mddukwari. Field of chief a-dha ga (o’)u.
Table of man tarabeza (Ar.) ga ulu pr. gulu.
In connection with final vowels, elision takes place almost exclusive­
ly after d and df- E.g.: unfr(i} drum; ndr{i) rain; inyi-didr^} finger.c) Assimilation
It is due to euphony. Examples: yi, yini to be numerous. They are
many ina gbo; neg. ina gbosd. Ear noo; my ear nvuma. Eye we; my eye
moma (also mumd). To dig a hole pr. vbdi, from: hole vu + dig adi* To
untie ufu; untie it! ufo-no. Groundnuts dmandi; his groundnuts
amaneye.
d) Individual pronunciation
The subject has already been touched upon. Here are some of the
more common cases:
u — u — o = v. E.g.: man ulu = old = olo. Tomorrow = dmondri —
omundri.
a = e = e. E.g.: hunger nvi = nve. Thing ede, ede = ide = idi ...
2. CENTRALISATIONIn these notes, I have used three centralised vowels: a, e, o, choosing,
in each individual case, the vowel nearest to the actual pronunciation
of my informant(s). If any literature were to be printed in Birri, a
fuller knowledge of the language would be required: only on that con­
dition a discussion might be possible about the convenience of using
only one (a), or perhaps two (a and o) centralised vowels.
3. NASALISATIONIt is not so widespread as in Zande, but it is fairly frequent. As in
Zande, it is subject to “spreading”. E.g. to beat eme; I beat him mdmeeSantandrea, The Birri Language89te. Nasalation spreads from the preceding e of the verb to the following
one of the pronoun: “progressive nasalation”.
4. GLOTTAL STOP BEFORE AND BETWEEN VOWELSGenerally speaking, its “plosion” is not particularly strong; by
careless speakers, especially when they are talking fast, it is omitted
altogether both before and between vowels.
In the two following words of everyday usage the glottal stop is often
silent: o’u thirst; o’u chief. This takes place almost regularly in the
course of phrases. E.g.: he is a chief you = yau.
5. BRIEF REMARKS ON INDIVIDUAL VOWELS
tied have already been spoken of.","[6, 7, 8, 9, 10]"
"ELEMENTS CONNECTED WITH THE VERBi. Final particleshas been seen when dealing with the Imperative of com­
mand.
b) ca, sa, sha the negative particle always placed at the end of the
statements; a great number of examples have already
been supplied.
c) da, dha already amply illustrated.
d) nyi
There are only a few examples at hand:
He helped me du ma-nyi. Here ngi (to be seen further on) might replace
nyi.
To travel amai idi-nyi lit. “to travel, or walk, thing”. In phrases like
this, either nyi or no particle at all is used.
The following partial scheme of conjugation contains an interesting
idiomatic phrase and an example of the flexibility in the employment
of the particles in question.
sing. 1. ur adhe ma-nyi “fear makes me” = I am afraid
2.
ur adhe mu-nyi “fear makes you” = you (sing.) are afraid
3.
ur ddhe te-nyi (pr. finyi) “fear makes him”
pl. 1. ur adhe (a)munyi-ngi “fear on us”. Two noticeable features
a) no, no216Afrika und Ub&rsee, Band XLIXshould be pointed out in this last sentence: a) to avoid cacophony,
owing to the repition of nyi, the particle nyi is replaced by ngi', b) this
is the unique example at hand where ngi appears at the end of a state­
ment. (It might be, however, that the short phrase in question awaits
for further words of explanation.)
ii. Interpolated particlesAs stated for some other particles, the use of these two, as far as I can
judge, is not compulsory: they give the speech a more stilish tone and
fuller native flavour. The rule (if there are any) governing their em­
ployment and choice is beyond my knowledge, and I shall therefore
content myself with some examples and a few comments.
a)
ngi, nge
Where are you going to? mawd (pl.) (ngi) gu la? He went long since
dwd-ngi kava-da. I ate porridge just now m&nyo-ngi add BeBe-do.
b)
mve, nve — mve, nve
I ate porridge yesterday manyo (mve) aBo rindro. (In a parallel sentence
given above ngi has been used instead of mve.)
ifu mugu aydne (mve) (a)yd ra (a)fi ayi-ne
women those drank ... beer in month died-this.
One can also say: ... ayd-mve-ne ... = ayi-mvi-ne ...
[In connection with Final and Interpolated Particles it should be
remembered that the distinction between these two classes must not
be considered as so absolute (an extremely rare case in Sudanic lan­
guages) as to admit no exceptions. For example, here is one: mana-nvi
re waraga mo fru “I came with (a) paper (= letter) to you”, in which
nvi behaves as ngi.
Comparing Birri to other languages as far as this kind of particles is
concerned, the nearest to it I know is Yulu-Biga which, however, em­
ploys a greater number of them and indulges more lavishly in their use
(cf. my Yulu MS, XII, 1, ii).]
iii. ReduplicationWe may distinguish two types of reduplication:
a) verb repeated, with foreign elements between (e.g. an object). To
quote a well-known language, this is the Zande type.
b)
verb stem doubled, thus forming a single word.
Type a) is usually found in trans, verbs with an object: andd ma anda
“he saw me saw”; emene fe erne “they beat him beat”.","[46, 47]"

"Santandrea, The Birri Language233related languages on the other (cf. Tucker), though partaking at the
same time of characteristics foreign to those groups, but shared in com­
mon with Kare and possibly other related languages.
This brief recapitulation is intended as a reminder, and at the same
time as a stimulus for linguist experts and amateurs to push ahead
research and study in this little-known area on the heart of Africa.
(1) Plural affixes (cf. I, 2; IV, 1, ii)
a) The absence of proper plural affixes for nouns marks a notable
difference between Birri and the Ndogo-Feroge groups, but less be­
tween Birri and Bongo, for this language has only a “mild” form of
plural suffix, only sparingly used (cf. my Bongo I, 3).
b) The 3rd person of the Personal Pronoun has, as well as verbs, the
plural suffix ni (= ne): a feature shared in common with Aja. Verbal
adjectives have the same suffix (V, 1, (1)).
(2) Genitive and Possessive case (I, 4; VIII)
For nouns specifying other nouns, and for the case of intimate pos­
session, the “specifying” or “possessor” precedes and the “specified”
or “possessed” follows: Birri agreeing with Moru-Madi and disagreeing
with Ndogo-Bongo.
(3) (English) Prepositions — Postpositions (III)
For example, “on, under” are postpositions in Birri, contrary to
what happens in Ndogo-Bongo, but in agreement with Moru-Madi. It
is interesting to notice that such cases (as in Birri) are found in Dinka,
whereas they are alien from Luo, e.g. Jur (cf. my “Grammatichetta
Giub”, n. 95. Edited: Missioni Africane Verona, 1946).
(4) Personal Pronouns (IV, 1)
a) Birri ignores the double form, inclusive and exclusive, for “we”,
differing in this from Ndogo-Feroge, but agreeing with many other
languages, such as the Bongo-Kresh groups and Zande. Once more
Dinka agrees here with Birri, whereas Luo (e.g. Jur) agrees with NdogoFeroge (cf. my “Gramm. Giur”, n. 33).
b) Birri has special forms for “referring” pronouns, agreeing in this
point with Zande-Ndogo-Feroge, but only partly with Bongo. The
Kresh subgroup ignores altogether these special forms, as does the
Nilotic group: Dinka-Nuer-Luo.
(5) Verbs (V)
a) The conjugation of verbs with personal pronouns is similar to that
of the Bongo-Kresh groups, differing altogether from Ndogo-Feroge.
b) The fact that the object almost regularly precedes the verb is
absolutely foreign to Bongo, Ndogo and related languages, but is234Ajrika und Ubersee, Band XLIXstrangely reminiscent of Luo construction (cf. my “Gramm. Giub”,
n. 127).
c) The presence of a considerable number of verbal particles (final
and interpolated) bears close resemblance to Yulu-Biga-Kara.
d) Birri has a Passive construction, though of a peculiar type. The
Passive is missing in several Sudanic languages of this area, e.g. Zande,
but is found in the Ndogo-group. Nzakara, though belonging to the
Zande-group, agrees with Ndogo.
e) Reduplication, both in verbs and verbal adjectives, is too com­
mon a feature to be commented upon.
(6) To be — To be present, living, found ... (VII, 2)
Birri has a rich and interesting set of verbs and substitutes for this
purpose, some of which are related to Zande and some to the MadiMoru group and related languages (cf. Tucker).
(7) To have (VIII, 4)
Birri presents a construction that differs from all the languages I
know.
(8) The Relative construction (IX)
a) The real relative (ma, am ...) shows an interesting link with many
well-known languages, such as Banda on one side, and Luo on the
other: a point which deserves deeper investigation.
b) The quasi-relative has a strong Bongo-like flavour, not altogether
alien from Ndogo-Bviri style.","[63, 64, 65]"
"THE INFINITIVE MOOD(1) Transitive verbs
The two commoner constructions are as follows:
a) object + verb stem: viz. the “reversed” construction, if compared
to the Sudanic languages of this area (Bongo-Kresh and Ndogo-Feroge
groups).",[39]
"93Santandrea, The Birri LanguageI = r Ui snake; ulu man; gala another
r
aviriti a kind of bat; nvare animal; ngboru baboon.
3. PALATALSIn connection with this section I was able to ascertain only a very
few points, if any of them can be said to be ascertained at all.
s
In all cases, except the following one, s was frequently inter­
changed by my informants with either c of sh. Example:
tooth si.
sh
This sound is by far more frequently heard than s, but can
(always) be interchanged with related sounds. I preferred, how­
ever, to represent in each case the actual pronunciation of the
individual speaker. Examples: to dress osh(y)b; to hear dasha',
bad akpa-sha (lit. “good-not”); light uma-sa (lit. “heavy-not”).
[It may interest phoneticians to observe that the Zande word sunge.
is turned into thunge, in Birri.]
/
I found j alone in a single word: ajiji boiled durrah.
It appears several times in combination with n: andanji dikdik
(a small antilope); nja mat.
For one word I heard both j and dz used: Pahudia (Afzelia)
Africana jaka = dzaka.
%
I have recorded only a few words with this sound: ^ia new
= ^idd (pronounced, however, by some: jyda); (it is) new ^ida-te
(on ^yad-fe, jyad-fs). Orphan i^o.
Interchangeability of consonants
I have already noted that several consonants are liable to change,
probably according to the different dialects spoken by my informants.
Two more cases are added here.
k = g (and viceversa). E.g.: he (she) said that... ayi-ka = ayi-ga...
Arrow matakadd (or matdkada) = matagadd.
The interchangeability of k and g is normal in Feroge-Mangaya, and
fairly frequent in several languages of the western Bahr el Ghazal and
adjoining territorries.
ny — y (and viceversa). E.g.: you (pl.) omunye = omuye.
VI. Tones
1. THE ROLE OF TONES IN GENERALThe circumstances in which my study of Birri was carried out were
on the whole unfavourable, and particularly in connection with points
such as this, entailing special care, patience and time.","[13, 14]"
"204Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIX3. EMPHATICi. Common emphatic forms= the possessive pronoun placed after the subject:
ulu gard awane gu mo, adyi gayine guga “men others went home, (he)
remained himself there”.
ifu mugu adyine gayine-ne guga “the women remained themselves
there”.
mad gamayine avuru fene kirikpa “we ourselves (are) simply (kirikpa)
their subjects (avuru-fene)”.
[As shown above, the emphatic pronouns are made in exactly the
same way as in Ndogo (cf. my Ndogo, pp. 64—67), differing very little
from Zande (mi ti-gimi, mo ti-gamo ...). Occasionally they might be
translated: As for me, as for myself; as for yourself, etc. ...]
ii. Quasi-belative emphatic pbonounsAll the examples available are in the 3rd person:
sing, ni, pl. nini (= nine), placed at the end of the statement.
Instead of ni, nini (= nine), also nyi, nyine are often heard.
Ngathu agu amanyi ni “God created us himself”; sme(n)ne amanyi nini
“beat-they us themselves”; ana kdtu nyi “(he) came before himself”;
(fene) anani kaBo nyine “came-they late themselves”.
These pronoun forms have just been seen at the end of the Reflexive,
and will be found again when dealing with the Relative. In fact the
sentences given above could easily be turned into relative ones: It is
God that created us; it’s they that beat us, etc.
This is one of those African grammatical elements that defeat classi­
fication after “western” standards. At its basis there lies the idea of
emphasis, but its usage covers a much wider field, to meet manifold
aspects of African psychology.
iii.","[34, 35]"
"205Santandrea, The Birri LanguageWhat do you do ? ddhe wa? Why ? aru-wa-re? (See above: Postpositions:
for).
The Interrogative being closely connected with the Relative, more
about it will be seen when dealing with the latter.
5. DEMONSTRATIVEBesides fulfilling their specific function, demonstratives often serve
to denote plurality, stand for the definite article and, as will be seen
later, are frequently found in relative constructions, though normally
simply as adjuncts, or with adjuncts.
Moreover demonstratives, followed by a copula (expressed or under­
stood), may mean “here is, here are”, etc. In fact, “this” and “here”,
“that” and “there”, are very often the same words, fulfilling a twofold
function.
There is hardly any distinction between adjectives and pronouns:
do (= do), budo (= bu-do), yine, ngine (— yi + ne, ngi -|- ne) this, that.
mugu (very seldom mu), placed after a noun, regularly serves to denote
the plural.
ne an enclitic, often following demonstratives, mostly mugu, but also
employed in other constructions. In several cases it is interchangeable
with do.
Examples
ungbd ifu-db call that woman; pl. ungbd ifu mugu-ne.
inyi-db ^u this goat is a male.
mandd rends (a)mu(gu) ndho “I see children those small”.
umd-db akpd-dd that man is good; pl. umd-(do) mugu akpa-na dd.
ene budo take this; pl. dkpe (= gather) ede (= things) mugu.
ene bugado take that; pl. dkpe bugado.
ungbd budo call this; ungbd bugadb call that; ungbd bu{db) mugu-ne call
these (or also: those, if the persons in question are not far away).
[Comparison with other languages
do = do closely resembles do, as found in Aja (cf. my Aja MS)

For Ndogo, see my Ndogo, Demonstratives, pp. 70—73, and for

Demonstratives.]A note on the enclitic ne = ni ...
A thorough discussion on this short word, n + vowel, even if limited
to the narrow range of my linguistical studies, would fill enough pages
Afrika und Cberaee, Band XLIX/3 — 196514206Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIXto form a sizeable booklet. Though not strictly necessary, a tentative
investigation on its nature according to “western” standards may help
to understand its use better.
Fundamentally I should call it a demonstrative enclitic: such it is,
e.g., as the second component of the demonstrative yine, which might
be respelt yi + ne. But its presence in relative constructions also justify
the other appellation of co-relative enclitic, being actually part, either
essential or complementary, of such constructions.
Both as the second component of a demonstrative, quite in the same
position as in Birri, and as an enclitic, ni is found in Bongo (cf. my
Bongo, Demonstratives, pp. 42—45).
As a demons, enclitic, it is also found in Yulu (cf. my Yulu MS, VII,
viii). In Kara it has still wider applications as a demonstrative (cf. my
Kara MS, VII), and it appears not only as a co-relative enclitic, but
as a real substitute for the relative pronoun itself (cf. ibi, XVIII).
In Kresh it covers more or less the same wide field.
As a demonstrative, often functioning as a mere enclitic, ni (ne) is
found in the Feroge-group (Feroge, Mangaya and Indri), as well as in
all the languages of the Ndogo-group (Ndogo, Sere, Tagbu, Bai and
Bviri: cf. my Ndogo, pp. 70—73), to which Mondu, closely related to
both groups, must be added. In this last language, ne functions as a
real co-relative enclitic, whereas in the Ndogo and Feroge groups its use
in relative sentences is “ornamental” rather than “essential” (cf. my
Ndogo, XIV, pp. 122—125 and my Mondu MS.).
A deeper study of Tucker’s The Eastern Sudanic Languages
would show, I think, relationship on this point with several of those
languages.
6. INDEFINITE[“Indefinite” is taken here in its broadest sense.]
Other, another, some gala, pl. gdlane, gala mugu-ne.
Call another ungba gald-ne. Call others ungba gald mugu-ne.
Some died gala mugu-ne ayini-dd. Some fled gala mugu-ne addne-da.
Are the others there? gala mugu-ne kpd gd(d)? Yes gala mugu-ne kpd
gd. No gala mugu-ne (i)ga sha. Five small boys came; the others re­
mained there rende ndhb nigild ananena; gala mugu-ne define guga.
Unlike in several Sudanic languages of this area, the indefinite fol­
lows the noun to which it refers:
ungba uma gald call another man.","[35, 36, 37]"
"Intransitive verbs
1) verb + specification (adverb, etc.). If there is none: —
2) verb + no = no, or else the verb is reduplicated.
[It is a well known aspect of verbs in most Sudanic languages, that
they cannot stand “alone”; if no object or specification follows, a
device of the type shown above must be resorted to.
N.B. no = no is found in the same construction in Gabu (cf. my
Banda-Zande, VIII, 2, Gabu).]
For the plural, m precedes the verb.
Beat the child me yoo-ngu. Count all the people u^rd ulu (a)fe.
Take ddi-no. Untie ufu-no. Tie 6ro-no. Gather dkpi-no. Gather (pl.) makpi
idi-no. Eat onyo-no, pl. monyo-no. Drink dyd-no, pl. maya-no.
A pronoun, not preceded by a preposition, may be interpolated be­
tween verb and object: Pour me water = otho ma wu.
N.B. no (no), in cases of this kind, virtually replaces the non-existing

"Consonants1. LABIALSDoes b exist in Birri ? Although my informants occasionally pro­
nounced it, I have good reasons to believe that it is not found
in this language. The fact that Zande has virtually replaced their
native tongue may well explain the “intrusion” of this foreign
sound. A strong proof in support of my opinion is that numerous
words shared in common with other languages have b in these
and always v in Birri. E.g.:
Mbomu (a river) mvomu. Gun bundu (in Zande) vundo (in Birri).
Maize mbom (in many local languages) nvomu (in Birri). As al­
ready noted, the very name of their tribe, pronounced Biri or
Birri by foreigners, is pronounced 71H by them.
y
a voiced labio-dental flapped consonant, pronounced by thrust­
ing the lower lip under the upper teeth. E.g.: kuyutu “a kind of
food”; ai-gaya to start.
[In the course of these notes I have distinguished only two kinds of
v sounds, simple v and y, because lack of a sufficient number of reliable
speakers prevented me from saying the last word on the subject. But
I think worth while recording at least here the results, though confused,
of my further inquiries.
a) I often heard a kind of “prolongued” v (in Italian we would say
strascicato). Was that due to a defect or a variety of pronunciation ?
Only here, I shall tentatively spell this consonant w.
b) Among my few informants there reigned great inconsistency all
over the field of v sounds, as the differences of spellings recorded for the
same words in my notes show. E.g.: to kill avi = awi', formerly kayada
= kawada = kawada-, road aya = awa-, Birri = Flri = 7HH.JbSantandrea, The Birri LanguageBpf91Sometimes the plosion preceded b is as strong as, e.g. in Ndogo:
eBe sweet. Sometimes it is so weak, that it could be overlooked
in spelling: aBd = abd porridge. In a single case some seem to
pronounce B, and some gb, instead: with aBo (or: aB) — agbo
(or: agba). I think, however, that the first spelling should be
preferred.
I have no example on record showing p alone. As far as I am
aware, it exists only in combination with k, forming kp. Paral­
lel words having p in other languages, but / in Birri, seemingly
support my suspicion. E.g. Guinea-fowl (Birri) ufe, (AvukayaMadi) bps. Moon (Birri) afi, (Ndogo, etc.) pfi, pi. To blow (of the
wind) (Birri) rafs, (Ndogo) pfi = pi.
is found in the words quoted above. Add, e.g.: neck ofo.","[11, 12]"
"2ueo“lax” i, as opposed to “tense” i (pronounced as in Italian), is
fairly common, but owing to phonetical context it occasionally
sounds simply i.
“lax” u, as opposed to “tense” u (pronounced as in Italian), is
similarly fairly common, but owing to phonetical context it
occasionally sounds simply u.
These two vowel sounds, well distinct from simply “close” e and
o, are found in Birri, as in other Sudanic and non-Sudanic
languages of this and adjoining areas. I do not discuss here
whether it would be advisable or not to employ these two ad­
ditional symbols in native literature, but I am convinced that it
is important to take notice of these special sounds, if one wants
to get a right pronunciation of the languages in question.
6. w BEFORE VOWELSThis point, though concerning directly a semivowel, is closely con­
nected with vowels. It resembles the phenomenon (already mentioned)
of the “euphonic initial vowels”, but it differs from it, because it takes
place with words in any position in the sentence. Sometimes w is pro­
nounced before vowels in words in which it is normally absent. I am
not in a position to tell whether the fact is due to the special pronun­
ciation of dialects or of individuals. Here are some examples, with w in
parenthesis: all af(w)e; day agb(w)e.
IV. DiphthongsDiphthongs are extremely rare in nouns. E.g.: wu water. They are
found more frequently in verbs, both composed with w and y. E.g.: we90A frika und Cbersee, Band XLIXclean; awl kill; (ujwi sow (e.g. durrah); (a)yi die; ayd drink; ayu sow
(by spreading seeds, e.g. sesame).
In connection with w followed by a vowel, the result is sometimes
pronounced more like a hiatus than a diphthong. E.g. : instead of we,
one should perhaps write ue, viz. two syllables instead of one. Other
times u is clearly pronounced before w. E.g.: uwe field; uwuu water.
The spelling of the latter word suggests another remark. The vowel
following the semivowel is often long, indeed is sometimes double, with
two different tones, as in ‘water’, the first being a middle one and
the second low.

"Santandrea, The Birri Language229The special “referring” forms are found in reported speech: Nginzo
ayi-ka: nvaraga gdye Go-sa; pl. ayini-ka: nvaraga gayene Gosa Nginzo
said: He has not a hoe; they said: They have no hoes.
IX. The Relative Construction(1) Relative pronoun ma, am ..: both as subject and object: am(a)
athu dhdra yd % pl. am(a) athu dhard yane ? “(he) who burnt hut, who” ?;
ma (a)nda mu ma “(he) who saw you, I”; ndoro ^yd ayi-sha, ama (a)yi
i-gbd-pre “pot new did not break (lit. die), the-one-which broke is the
old-one”; uma-db m-anda nge fe, (y)e atyu “the man whom you saw ...
him, he (is) here”, pl. umd-db mugu m-dndd ye fene, yen(e) atyu; umd
ngine m-ovo nge fe ava-ne “the man that whom you met ... him (on)
the road this”; am(a) adhe ede-db ya 1 “(he) who made this thing, who ;
ma (a)dhe md (pr. madhemd) “(he) who made, I”; m(a) adhe ede-db mu
“(he) who made this thing, you”.
[The relative ma is common to the Feroge-group, Banda, Jur-Luo, etc.]
(2) Quasi relative pronoun = sing. m(i), pl. nini(i) placed at the
end of the statement
[nii, ninii has already been seen many times in the course of these
notes. When pronounced slowly, nii shows a double i: the first with a
middle tone and the second with a low one: nii.]
ddhe ede-db ni(i) “made this thing, he” = it’s he that made it; andri
awi pre nii it’s the buffalo that killed him (awi prene nii = that killed
them); yi-gbd-fe ayi-nii it’s the old-one that broke; Ngdthu agu ulu (a)fe
ni it’s God that created man; emene amanyi nini it’s they that beat us;
adhe yine nini it’s they that made this; yd awi fe ni it’s beer that killed
him (viz. that made him drunk).
The following sentences contain the “referring” forms:
ayi-ka: n(a) adhe gd nii sa he said: It was not he who made (it); pl.
ayini-ka'. n(a) adhe gd nine sa.
(3) Substitutes for the relative = demonstratives
We may divide them in two series:
a)
ordinary demonstratives + enclitic ne, ni
dndd-ngi umd-db o’o undha “(he) saw man-this (that) stole durrah”;
anvune ulu awi Go a’u-ne “they caught (the) man (that) killed is the
chief”; ameme rende nguu awi (ngi) ndorone “they beat the small
children (who) broke the pot”; umd ngine awi-ngi a’u ... “man that
killed ... the chief”.
It is difficult to fix any rule for the use of these demonstratives.
Taken one by one, normally they can be used or dropped at will. Much230Afrika und Vbersee, Band XLIXdepends on the “literary” taste of the speakers, some of whom seem to
relish in their lavish employment.
uma ngine movb nge ava fe i akpa tyu-no “the man that you (pl.) met
that (on) the road, he is here-that”; onvu rende ngine ngu awi-ngi ndbro
“catch child that small (that) broke ... the pot”; ifu mugu aydne (mve)
(a)ya r(e) afi ayi-ne ... “women those that drank ... beer in month
died-that” (viz. last month).
b) nvene = nve + ne (composed of nve, an interpolated particle, and
ne, the commonest demonstrative enclitic).
This form seems to have a stronger “relative flavour” than the ordi­
nary demonstratives, and is therefore frequently employed for this
purpose.
uma nvene mb-ne ayi-dd “the man that (was) at-home-this, died”; (ine)
uma-ne mugu-ne adhene iga re afe nvene ayi nvene “(they are) the men
those (= who) made a fight in month that died this” (= last month);
du nve katyu-ne e budo “the chief that (was) before, is here”; pl. du
nvene katyu-ne, ene budo.
[On the whole, Birri relative constructions bear great resemblance
to those found in the Ndogo-Feroge and Bongo-Kresh groups. They
may be summed up as follows: a) real relative sparingly used; b) de­
monstratives often replacing the relative; c) ample use of the de­
monstrative enclitic ne, ni.]

"Imperative of commandTransitive verbs

"94Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIXTone certainly plays an important role in Birri, but I cannot make
an estimate, however rough, of its weight in comparison with neigh­
bouring Sudanic languages. I have the impression that, with regard to
single words, tone is not so decisive as, e.g. in the Ndogo group. But in
connection with other points, e.g. the conjugation of verbs, tonality is
absolutely essential in Birri as in the Bongo-Kresh group.
2. WORD TONEEven within the narrow limits of my Birri Vocabulary one can detect
several couples of words differing only in tone. E.g.:
to run awi(i)
to kill awi(i)
goat inyi
hand inyi
to be hot Sms
to insult odo
to beat sms
to tie 5do
to dig aga
Birri aviri
to cut dga
Kare aviri
Kresh agbdyd
Zande agbaya
3. TONE IN THE SENTENCEIn the course of these notes I have endeavoured to mark, whenever I
could, the variations of tones according to the various contexts, but I
am not in a position to explain details with sufficiently grounded
reasons. All I can do is to express my impressions on the matter.
Changes in tone take place mainly on a double basis: first, the differ­
ent position in the sentence; secondly, the phonetical context. That is:
the tone of the preceding word, and less often that of the following one,
may alter the original tone of a word. Here is one example at hand, to
which many others might be added:
mugu demonstrative adjective. But: umd-db mugu ene d’u those men
are chiefs. Here, coming after do, which has a low tone, mugu acquires
middle tones in both syllables.
A NOTE ON THE MORPHOLOGICAL STRUCTURE OF WORDSBefore entering the field of Grammar proper, I think it worth point­
ing out the prevailing morphological formation of the principal parts of
speech: nouns, verbs, adjectives in Birri, comparing it with that of
languages more or less related.
N.B. a) means the more common pattern and b) the less common
one; v. means vowel, c. means consonant.

“exclusive” formation.","[14, 15]"
"Santandrea, The Birri Language213He said: He will (or would) not come ayi-ka: na-ye ga g-and cd; pl. ayinika: nd-ye-gd-ne g-and cd.
Here we find: a) na referring pronoun; b) yi-ga = ye-ga future prefix;
c) ga prefix of the following verb, which is thus in the infinitive mood.
iii. Continuous (tense) = unfinished actionIt is formed by means of ri, normally placed after the subject or in
its stead, but liable to change position, as it is liable to phonetical
variations: re, ra — ir, er, ar ...
What about its original meaning ? As far as I know, there are two
possible interpretations, both of which leave me doubtful:
a) ri (= re) is the preposition “with”, the resulting phrase being, e.g.
“I am with work(ing), I am with walk(ing)”. This feature would be
unique within the sphere of my linguistical studies, but the seemingly
obvious interpretations of phrases of this kind is in its favour: yi r(e)
add “he (is) with sleep” = he is sleeping; (y)i r(e) akpee “he (is) with
cough(ing)” = he is with cough, he is coughing, he has cough.
b)
ri (= re) is an auxiliary verb “to be”, to be seen further on.
This interpretation would agree with the common usage of related
languages, but my documentation in this respect is too scarce and weak
to allow me to draw from it a conclusion free from doubt. On the other
hand, as we shall see, the existence of a similar auxiliary in Avukaya
(a language of the Logbara-Moru group, with which Birri shows a
considerable degree of relationship) seems to support this opinion (cf.
Tucker, p. 233, n. 523).
He is walking ir-amvd. What are you doing ? mu re (pr. muru) wa (a)dhe?
I am building a hut ma-re dhard (hut) dru (head) odo. He is sweeping
(i-)re da we “(he) is place sweeping”. I am dressing ma vbng5 re osho

ri di (thing) akpe (pr. ri dakpe). He is beating iri (i)de (e)me, pl. ene re

"The language
De Calonne-Beaufaict says that the Birri represent, together with
the Momvu, the oldest aboriginals of the Mbomu Basin. He speaks of
“fragments de vocabulaire Birri, rattachant directement cette language
aux divers dialects momvu”; but he quotes no Birri word (pp. KB­
IT). At p. 142 he gives a list of twenty words in Momvu and Logo,
which show much more similarity between Momvu and Logo than be­
tween Momvu and Birri. On the whole, I am afraid that de Calonne’s
statements cannot be safely relied upon.
I think that the fairly ample linguistic material I have gathered
enables me to formulate the following statement: Birri stands as a
“central” language, both geographically and linguistically, in the
Mbomu-Bahr el Ghazal area, showing relationship to the Momvux) See: “From the Congo to the Niger and the Nile”, Afr. Exped. of A. F.

"(2) Reduplication
A short note on this subject will spare explanations of a number of
cases to be seen in the next chapter.
Adjectives normally show reduplication of Type B), viz. the verb
stem is repeated, but other forms, alien from verb reduplication, are
also found. In several cases, for example, only the first syllable of the
adj. is doubled; in others, a foreign element is interpolated between.
Moreover one notices that reduplication is more frequent in the plural
and in negative statements. Examples:
Is that tree big? kpi-db ukdmd? Yes kpi-db (yi) ukama-, pl. kpi-dbmugu
(yini) ukdmd. Neg. ukdmd fre-sha, pl. ukdkdmd fre-sha. Cut a big tree
dgd kpi ukama. Cut big trees dgd kpi ukdkdmd.
Instead of ukama, another adj. can be used, meaning “huge” or
“thick”: I cut a big tree mdgd kpi okoko (okoko is probably the redupli­
cated form of the stem (o)ko).
Big applied to persons: He is big ikpdkpo. The big boys are there
rends mugu kpotokpo i-ga. (Notice the foreign element, to, placed be­
tween the doubled stem.)
Small, little ngu or ngu-, the usual plural is ndhb, from a different
stem. Another plural is: tikiki, pronounced by other informants tekete,
formed from the stem ti or te reduplicated, with ki or ke interpolated
between.1)
x) This adj. is reminiscent of the Zande equivalent tikitiki tiny, applied, e.g.
to the smallest kind of banana fruits and to the Pygmies of Congo.",[50]
"Santandrea, The Birri Language225Question: Have you a name? Answer: I have a name irima re (=
Zande: rimore tini) “my name is (there, found ...)”.
VIII. The Possessive ConstructionIn many Sudanic languages the Possessive is only a particular case of
Predicative Construction. In Birri, on the contrary, it contains hetero­
geneous elements justifying a separate tractation.
1. THE POSSESSIVE CASEIt has already been seen in the chapter on Norms (4. A noun speci­
fying another noun.), therefore only a few words are added here.
i. Possessive intimateviz. concerning things, persons, etc. intimately connected with the
possessor, such as the parts of the body, etc.:
mvdro
ugba
aBu\ ngumi udho
elephant’s tooth; leopard’s skin; gazelle’s horn
There is a noteworthy feature to point out here: the “possessor”
precedes the “possessed”, contrary to what happens in the NdogoFeroge and Bongo-Kresh groups, besides Zande. Birri, in this detail, is
nearer to the Moru-Madi, etc. group (cf. Tucker). Some more examples:
He hit the lion’s head with a (piece of) wood eme anvuruvi clru (= head)
re kpi. The chief’s children are five a^u yoo nyigila. The leg of the
gazelle broke ngumi ungba ako-da.
ii. Possessive non-intimateHere the construction is the same as in Ndogo, Bongo, Zande, etc.:
“possessed” + possess, particle + “possessor”. E.g.:
adha ga (a)vd;
adha ga gbaya
field of father (= daddy); field of (the) chief
The possess, particle is the same as in Zande: ga.
2. POSSESSIVE ADJECTIVESWhereas in many other languages there is a substantial difference
between the possessive intimate and non-intimate, only slight dis­
crepancies are occasionally found in Birri; so slight, that one is at
loss whether to ascribe them to grammar or to the varying of the
dialects spoken by (my) informants. Moreover there are cases in which
one is free to choose between a couple of different forms. Pronominal226Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIXsuffixes are joined to the noun to which they refer, because they form
with them a single unit in pronunciation. Possessive adjectives consist
of the pronominal affixes added to the “possessed” (a noun), of which
we give a full list:

Non-intimate

Comments and additional notes
a) As can be drawn from the above schemes, there are only two special
suffixes: we for the 2nd pers. sing, intimate, confined to terms of re­
lationship, and manye for the 1st pers. pl. non-intimate.
|j| b) Phonetical variants are of the usual types, e.g.: fini instead of
tene, as customary with pers. pronouns; ny — y, as mentioned in
Phonetics. To these we may add the unusual changing of manye into
mai, possible due to dialectal variation: momanye = momai (our
country), vundumanye = vundumai (our tribe or clan), etc.
c) As repeatedly observed, distinction between classes etc. are never
absolute. So, e.g. “tribe”, which usually falls under the “intimate”
class, is treated in Birri as the non-intimate.
Even more characteristic are the two following exceptions: God
created our bodies Ngathu agu aBumanyeni; our souls will not die
ngdthumanye ayi-sha.
d) Anomalous cases are few in number, e.g. irii used instead of irinye
“thy name”. We also have special forms for the 1st pers. sing of
“father” and “mother” (corresponding to English “daddy” and
“mamma”), but these are customary with almost all languages of this221Santandrea, The Birri Languagearea. In Birri the special form for “father” is often heard also in the
plural: dvdne = 6udi.
3. POSSESSIVE PRONOUNSPossessive pronouns are made thus: “possessed” + convenient pro­
nominal suffix: the same used for possessive adjectives.","[55, 56, 57, 58]"
"214Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIXThe “unfinished action” presents the same construction in all tenses.
In the next chapter two sentences are given, under the heading GerundParticiple, actually showing the continuous tense used in the Past.
Examples with referring pronouns :
ayi-ka: ni re ide 6ny6 “he said: he is thing eating”. One can also say:
ayi-ka: ni gd re (i)d& bnyo “he is going thing to eat” (future, with only
ga, as already seen). The following example shows the same construction
in the plural: ayini-ka: ni-ga-ne re (i)de onyo.
Instead of the referring pronoun, the emphatic is occasionally used:
ayini-ka: nine (= ngine) re ide onyo “they said: they themselves (or,
rather, as for themselves) (they) are eating”.
5. THE CONDITIONAL MOOD — GERUND-PARTICIPLEi. ConditionalHere are the few sentences, containing the conditional mood in
English, which I succeeded in getting translated in Birri:
If you do not come, you will be caught (= imprisoned, etc.) ana-sha,
anvune mu (—mo) anvu. If you come late, you will be beaten ana de
ka66, imine mb erne. If you work well, you will be paid well ddhe thunge
lele, akpane-nye edikpo Isle “(you) do work well, they give you iron
(i.e. money = pay) well”.
As far as I can see, “if” is ignored in all these sentences, which exhibit
simply the indicative. The only word that leaves me doubtful is de, in
the 2nd sentence, which I suppose to be an adjunct of kaBo, placed be­
fore it; but might it not be the conjunction “if”, placed after the subject
as happens in many other Sudanic languages, e.g. in the Ndogo group ?
ii. Gerund-PartcipleFrom the few examples available one gathers that these two moods
are reduced to other constructions, especially to the continuous tense:
I found him eating (= while he was eating) mavo (pr. mom) nge fe re ede
onyb. He found me asleep (= sleeping) bvo ma re odo (= add).
6. THE PASSIVE VOICEi. The passive constructionBirri has a passive construction, made up as follows: verb 4- de-g(a) 4agent 66 (— 6a), dega 4- 66 being a compound preposition or, rather,
anteposition, and postposition. As de-ga, in its turn a compound prepo­Santandrea, The Birri Language215sition, has its two components pronounced separately, they will also be
spelt separately.
dhara ago (= oyo) da the hut burnt, or: was burnt. By whom ? ga yd
66? It was burnt by this man 6yb de g-uma-db 66. The case is being
settled (= finished) by the chief ngbanga-db ari de (pr. ari-da) gagbaya
66 (= 6d).
ii. The quasi-passive, or impersonal, constructionThis is the commonest construction found in the Sudanic languages
of this area. The passive is turned into active after the following pattern:
“He was killed” is turned into “they killed him”.
We were caught (= imprisoned) without a reason anvune amanyi
kerekpa. He was beaten with a stick emene (e ri kparara. He was pierced
(= speared) with a spear a^runi Ie ri ngbard. The chief was caught
anvune ulu ga $6.
The sentences quoted under the heading “Conditional”, and many
more, might be added here.
7.","[44, 45, 46]"
"THE INDICATIVE MOODThe tense
The question of tense is less difficult in Birri than in many neigh­
bouring languages. The future and the continuous tense have their own210Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIXconstructions. For the past, the final particle da, or dha, frequently
ends the statement. As for the “western” present, if the action is still
going on, it is easily turned into the continuous or imperfect tense;
otherwise, when there is no final particle, it does not differ from the
past. Occasional adjuncts or the context itself generally serve to dis­
tinguish between them. There might be a different form for the present
habitual, but I have no examples of this kind recorded in my notes.
i. Past = PresentExamples. The hut burnt dhara dyo-dd. My mother died ydmd ayidd. He married (a woman) adi iju-da. A man burnt a hut ulu athu dhard.
He beat the lion’s head with a stick erne dnvuruvi c[ru (head) re kpi.
(Note the different pronunciation of the verb “beat” in the following
sentence by another informant: A man beat a fellow man ulu amd
unc[ri.) Does he smoke ? aya taba? (“does he drink tobacco ?”). He does
not smoke ayasha.
Conjugation schemes
I had great difficulty in marking the tones, which actually resulted
different in the two periods of my study of Birri. I shall mark A) the
earlier period and B) the later one.
Though not quite satisfied with it, I attempt an explanation, at least
a partial one, of such differences. A) regularly laid stress on the first
syllable, whose original tone was seemingly low (or at any rate lower
than the next one), whereas B) slurred lightly over it, normally giving it,
at least apparently, the same tone as that of the following syllable. On
the other hand, B) occasionally pronounced, though swiftly, the original
a of the pronoun in the first pers., sing, and plural. Thus when the verb
begins with a, the vowel is pronounced fairly long, and has been there­
fore written with a dash over it (but only in these schemes).

to marrydidia, diIs is surprising to find so little in common between Birri and Zande,
so much so that my informants were more conversant with Zande than
with their native tongue. Moreover two points should be borne in mind:
first, some of the words shared in common with Zande probably derive
from an archaic common stock; secondly, a deeper study of Birri may
reveal some indigenous substitutes for the Zande-like words found in
this list and elsewhere. For example, instead of dmande “groundnuts”,
the only word I had heard from many informants, I later discovered

"197Santandrea, The Birri Language2. NUMBERI am not aware of the existence of any plural affix in Birri: a, which
occasionally precedes a noun, may be due either to Zande reminis­
cence, or simply to euphony.
katyu
aviri (mugu)
mvomu 6a
formerly the Birri
(were or lived) (by the) Mbomu side
The demonstrative mugu (to be seen further on) seems to replace the
missing plural affix. It is normally silent when other elements indicate
plurality. When mugu really acts as a demonstrative, it is frequently
followed by the enclitic ne.
ungba ifu mugu-ne call the (or those) women; manda ulu iggila I see
five persons.
But I also heard the following sentence: mavo uma mugu ukodyi I
looked at the four men.
Thief: sing, ulu-ga-o’o, pl. ulu mugu ga de (= thing) 6’o.
Blacksmith eme-ga-de, pl. erne mugu gd-de.
Owner of house ulu gd-mo (= ulu-gd-mo), pl. ulu mugu gd-mo.
3. GENDERmale o’u, female (a)md, (a)maThese two terms can be used as substantives and as adjectives. In
the latter case, when used attributively, they simply follow the noun to
which they refer; when used predicatively, a copula may be employed.
Cock undM o’u; hen undhi amd; a female beast nvure (u)ma.
This goat is a male inyi-do o’u; it is a female dmd.
He killed a male buffalo avi (= awl) andri o’u (= a’u).
They killed five female buffaloes avini andr(i) nyigild dmd.
For persons, here are the terms used:
man (irrespective of sex, Latin homo) ulu.
man (a male, Latin vir) umd.
woman ifu.
4. A NOUN SPECIFYING ANOTHER NOUNThis construction might be reduced to the “genitive case”. The
“specifying” or “possessed” noun is preceded by the “specified” or
“possessing” one: The opposite of what happens in the Ndogo-Feroge
and Bongo-Kresh groups and in Zande.
elephant’s tooth (= tusk); leopard’s skin; gazelle(’s) horn
mvoro shii;
ugbd abu;
ngumi udho198Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIXdurrah seed(s);
sesame seed(s)
undha otro;

The construction in question can be turned into a possessive one. In
this case the possess, particle, ga, joins the two nouns, the “specified”
one coming first: gala g(a) aBu bag of leather; kutukpaa g(a) adi mat
of Borassus Flabellifer.

When attached to a noun, 5 is often pronounced: ig(g)ilo (iggila)...
My personal inquiries and my informants’ explanation have produced
only the following scarce and partly uncertain explanations.
5 is evidently composed of inyi “hand” and ild “one”. The consonant
preceding ild is probably the possessive particle ga, deprived of its
final vowel. Thus the whole might literally mean: “hand of one (man)”.
ethe remains unexplained. Might it mean “and” ? Similarly no ex­
planation could I find of the following: ungb(a), tika, etc.

III. Prepositions and Postpositions

"LOCATIVE CONSTRUCTIONSThe subject finds its proper place here, for adverbs play the most
important role, though also other elements are connected with it.

[This is the proper place to remember a feature already seen in the
course of these notes. To introduce “reported speech”, which practically
corresponds to the English direct speech, Birri employs (a)yi-ka for the
sing, and ayini-ka for the plural. The verb {a)yi means “to say”, but
should be classified as a defective verb, for it is used only in this par­
ticular circumstance. It is parallel to the Latin: inquit, inquiunt.
A rare variant of ayi-ka, ayini-ka is: ai-dha for the sing, and dni-dha
for the plural.]
VI. Adjectives1)(1) The following are the main features concerning adjectives:
a) Whether they are used as attributes or predicates, they follow the
noun to which they refer, whereas in many other Sudanic languages,
e.g. the Bongo-Kresh and Ndogo-Feroge groups, besides Zande, the
attribute precedes the noun.
b) When an adjective is employed as a substantive, it is followed by
fre (pronounced by some /e) for the sing, and frene (= fens) for the
plural. This also happens frequently when the adj. stands alone and,
occasionally, when it is remote from the noun to which it refers. It is
the 3rd pers. of the pers. pronoun, fulfilling manifold functions, as the
forms (y)i, (y)ini do. But whereas the latter precedes adjectives, nouns,
etc., the former follows.
c) Adjectives can aptly be divided in two classes: qualitative and
verbal. The distinction between them is made clear by the way with
which the plural is made: for qualitative adj., either the copula or
other subsidiary elements are employed, whereas verbal adj. have the
pl. suffix ne (= ni) as verbs. An additional feature of verbal adj. is a
more abundant use of reduplication.
x) This chapter may appear unusually short, but abundant material on Adjec­
tives is also found in the next chapter, which deals with the Predicative Con­
structions.","[48, 49]"
"95Santandrea, The Birri LanguageThe morphological structure of a word may bear upon its possible
modification, as it happens, e.g. in Bongo, where verbs behave differ­
ently according to their belonging to pattern a) or b).","[15, 16]"
"A partial scheme of conjugation with pers. pronouns

eating”.
One sentence contains ta between subject and re: it is either an inter­
polated particle or the adverb “still”: md-r undha uvi = ma-ta-r undhd
uvi “I am durrah sowing”.",[44]

His head aches dufri arara; pl. dutene aragara. Rep. speech: ayi-ka:
duye arara; pl. duyine aragara.
He said: It is mine ayi-ka: i gama; pl. i gamanye. Rep. speech: i gdye;
pl. i gayene.
3) The referring possessive forms are also occasionally used in ordi­
nary indirect speech, to stress the fact that the “possessed” belongs to
the subject mentioned just before: agi amandefe-da he sold his (= his
father’s, his mother’s, etc.) groundnuts; agi dmandeye-da he sold his
(own) groundnuts. The same holds good for the plural: amandefene
(= their, of other people); amandeyine (— their own).
He left his (thing, etc.) at home i vd gafe mo-gd (it means some­
body else’s thing, etc.); pl. i vane gafene mo-gd. But: i vd gdye-ne mo-gd
(it means “his own”); pl. i vane gdyene-ne mo-gd.
Here the speaker has added the enclitic ne to the possessive pronoun.
4. TO HAVEThe English verb “to have” is expressed thus:
“possessed” (4- kpa) -f- possessive pronoun + do (= Bd)
Here is the full declension of the phrase “I have”, etc.: dots stand
for the “possessed”.

3.

The usual phonetical variants are frequently heard: ginyi = ginye,
geye; gafi = gafe, gafe; gafini = gafsne, etc.
What about Bol Most likely it is the same Bo already mentioned as a
postposition, which may include the idea of “being in” or “being by”
a place. Thus the phrase would literally mean: “my ... is there” —
“there is my ...” = 1 have ... Examples:

Bo I; pl. ana gagu Bo I I have ana gdmd Bo. I have not ana gama Bd-sa.

the boys many (= numerous)? rende atoto (alias: aty6tyo)1 Yes rends
dtoto (= dtyotyo) = in(i) dtoto (pr. ind (a)toto). No atg-ne-sha.
(3) Adjectives = verbs?
Sometimes we are confronted with adjectives which can hardly be
distinguished from verbs in their grammatical behaviour:
This beer is acid ya-db urere. When did it become acid? ore Beni It
became acid yesterday night ore rinfro dtyi. (Note the slight vocalic
variations taking place according to the varying of the phonetical
context.)
The following construction stands alone, as far as I can judge:
and ma re wuu ame kpo (pr. ambkpo) “come (to) me with water hot”;
tme akpasha “(it is) hot much”; wuu ime kpo “(it is) water hot”.
kpo is probably a complementary particle, added to the verb or adj.,
comparable to de in Ndogo, Bongo and Kresh, in which language it is
pronounced de (cf. my Bongo, n. 150).
(4) Special adjectives translated by means of phrases
Many adjectives denoting physical or moral feelings, and some others,
too, are translated in Birri by means of phrases, mostly verbal ones. (We
have already seen, e.g. “to be afraid” when dealing with the verb.)
Angry: I am angry tumd erne akpasa “my breast (is) hot much”. Is
the chief angry with you? d’u tyufe ofofro iyel “chief his inside (or
breast) hard to you?” He is not angry tyufe ofro-shd. Are you angry?
tyuye dfotro.
Hungry: Are you hungry ? nvee adhe mu-ni? “hunger makes you?” I
am very hungry nvee adhe ma akpaca. I am not hungry nvee, adhe ma-ca.
Thirsty: I am thirsty o’6 adhe ma^ni).
To be ill: He is ill uBd adhe fe-nl, pl. ... tene-ni. Neg. sing. uBd adhe
fe-sha, pl. ... tene-sha.
He is blind mote ayi-da “his eye died”. (Blind[-man] ulu mo(a)n.)
He is drunk yd awl (= ono) fe-ni “beer killed him”. Neg. ya ono te-shd.","[50, 51]"
"Examples containing phrases and full sentences:
It will be noticed that to translate the English phrase “it is ...
(mine, yours, etc.)” the copula (y)i is frequently employed, often fol­
lowed by the word “thing” (i)di, (e)de, to emphasize the idea of owner­
ship. The enclitic ne occasionally follows the possess, pronouns.
It’s mine
gamd. Where is yours? giye lai His is there, or: That is
his gafe-ne kpa ga (or kpa do). Ours is here gamdye-ne budo. Where is

to translate them in a small vocabulary.

3) It is a verb, applied only to water courses.","[20, 21]"
"Santandrea, The Birri Language199[In these and similar constructions it is more stilish to use the verb
in the plural, by adding the pl. suffix ne (= ana-ne). See, e.g., the fol­
lowing sentence: ovone &6o te “met-they with him” = he met him.]
Beat him with a stick erne fe re kpi.
He brought a big tree ana re kpi ukama “he came with a tree big”.
The preposition re is occasionally used also for persons: ede re fe guvb
he fell with him down.
To, against, etc.
I found several constructions.
a) with nouns. I have examples only from my later (and seemingly
better) informants: no preposition is used to join nouns: manti (e)re
(i)de titoto gbayanye “I came with things (= gifts) many (to) our chief”;
m(o) akpa yi-ghti-fe omumti (or: omumtinye) you gave (an) old thing
(to) my sister (or: our sister).
b) with pronouns. My later informants used the postposition yi
= ye instead:
to me (d)mti-yi = (a)mtiyi
to us
= amanye-ye = amayeye
to you mu-yi
= m6-yi
to him fe-yi
= feyi
to them = fene-ye = teneye
Here are the two examples obtained from my earlier informants:
I gave you one Franc makpa i-ye franka ilti
Is the chief angry with you (= against you = to you) ? a’u tyufe
optro i-ye ? “chief his breast hard to you ?”
At first I had thought i to be the preposition “to” and ye the pro­
nominal suffix corresponding to the personal pronoun “you” sing, (to
be seen further on). But later, comparing these two sentences with
those supplied by my more “learned” informants, I have come to the
conclusion that ye is the postposition already seen, and i may represent
a shorter or defective form of mo (you): due either to a particular
dialect or to careless pronunciation.
2. SOME COMMON POSTPOSITIONSto = fru = tu
It is sometimes employed when the noun to which it refers does not
follow immediately the verb from which it depends:
I brought this paper to you mana-nyi re waraga (Ar.) mo-fru “I came
with paper to you”.
[Compare Birri fru to tro in Madi-Lokai (Tucker, p. 171, n. 304).]
On =

In connection with postposition see also the Locative, in the chapter
on Adverbs.]
3.","[29, 30, 31]"
"“Referring” possessive suffixes in “reported speech”
(cf. IV, 1, iii): sing, ye, yi ..., pl. yine, yini, yene ...
The use of these special forms is not so conspicuous in Birri as it is,
e.g. in Zande and in the Ndogo-group languages. For the natives
normally employ either direct speech, with the 1st pers., or indirect
speech, with the 3rd pers.: both ordinary forms. Only after patiently
repeated efforts did I succeed in finding the special forms listed above.
Here are examples intentionally divided by numbers, according to the
different informants from whom they were obtained.
1) He said: His (own) field is big ayi-ka: adhama (= my field) ukama.
He said: It is not his ayi-ka: igdti-sa “it (is) his not”. They said: Their
(own) field is big ayini-ka: adhatene (= their field) ukama. They said:
It is theirs ayani-ka: gat^ne, or idi-tine “(it is) theirs”. He said: His
head aches ayi-ka’. duye dkuku (duye = special form); pl. ayini-ka:
duyine dkuku (duyine = special form).",[58]
"I tentatively classify two of them.
i. Compound nounsa) Nouns signifying a physical or moral quality are composed with
the noun ulu = man (irrespective of sex): blind(man) ulu-m/in.
b) Several compound nouns are just special examples of the pos­
sessive case:
Eood ede-ga-nvi lit. “thing of hunger”. Thief ulu-gd-6’o lit. “man of
theft”. (The same word, however, can be translated as follows: ulu ga
d(e) o’o = 6’6-ga-de “stealer of thing(s)”.) Sorcerer (= diviner) ara-gathenvid = dancer of thenvid (the special dance of such men). (A) leper
ulu-ga-gbdmv% “man of leprosy”. Blacksmith Ems-gd-ds “beater of
things”; or, more properly: me (ga) kusi “beater of anvil”.1)
ii. Locative nounsI have two of them on record:
“Field” is usually translated adha, e.g. when saying “my field, that is
the chief’s field”; but when it has a locative signification it is translated
ue (= ite, we).
awane gu we tyuu they went to the field
akene de we tyuu they came from the field.
Similarly “river, water” is translated wu (= water), but they say
mam gu lo I go to the river (= to the water).
*) Evidently the underlying meaning of ulu, when followed by a noun, is that
of ownership: physical, moral, etc. In some cases it actually corresponds to
master, owner. E.g.: tilti gd mi master (owner) of the house; tilti-md my master.",[27]
"105Santandrea, The Birri Languagevariations. The etymology of the Birri word is evident: “nut (= curu)
of the gbaya” (the Zande or the Kresh, according to the word-tone,
which I failed to record), ngbandi and the like, as found in other lan­
guages, either represents a corruption of the original, gbaya, or the
name of another tribe (the Ngbandi ?), to which the people ascribe the
introduction of this culture into the country. This same name (= culumondi) appears as far as Lepful Hill (the Lafon of maps) in Equatoria,
among the Pari, a branch of the Luo-Acoli race.

"Sometimes the context (mainly adverbs) dispenses with the use of
any verb or substitute:
aviri (mugu-ne) kdfa Mvomu Ba the Birri formerly (were = lived) by
the side of the Mbomu; sere kdfa angbd Ba the Sere formerly (were =
lived) by the side of (or on) the hills; inyi no t (is it) there a goat ? inyi no
there (is) a goat; inyi no shd there (is) no goat.
But generally speaking, verbs or equivalents are employed for the
purpose (some of which have already been seen), forming together a
rich collection. But lack of a deeper knowledge of the language allows
me to make only brief comments and a few comparisons with other
languages, especially with Zande, which served me as a medium to
converse with my Birri informants.
15*224Afrika und Ubersee, Band XLIX(1) yi, yini ... already seen as copula
e, ene ...
The Pambia live now on the hills Pambia ene afuru angbd 6a.
Here are two goats inyi ukwari yi budo (the copula is in the sing, because
“two” is enough to denote the plural).
In cases of this kind the copula may easily be turned into a real verb,
such as “to stay”. E.g.: anjange adye-ne {adyi-ni) wuu 6a tere the Dinka
stay (= live) near the water (= water side near).
(2) kpa, kpaa already repeatedly found
The women are inside ifa mugu kpd ddvdkd; the women are outside ifu
mugu kpd ngbald.
My Birri informants unanimously translated kpa in Zande kina. As
kina, in fact, kpa also means “only”: ulu mugu arine kpaa d’u {i)gbd
these people(s) want only the old chief; mayd kpaa wuu {o)sho I drink
only cold water.
(3) ga, ga an adverb meaning “here, there”, and other adverbs com­
posed with it: buga (= buga), bugado (— bugado) ... He is here i ga,
pl. ene ga-, neg. sing, e ga-sha, pl. ene ga-sha. The big boys are there rende
{mugu) kpotokpo {i) ga (= go). Are there many trees ? kpi {i)gd atoto 1 Yes
atoto. No ato-sha.
Sometimes we find kpa together with ga-. Is your (pl.) father at
home ? 6ugu yi kpd mb ga 1 Yes avd kpa ga. No ava ga sa. They are at
home ene kpd mb ga. Is it there durrah ? undha kpa ga 1 Yes i {kpa) ga.
No = i ga-cd.
Sometimes, as already mentioned when dealing with the Demonstra­
tives, these pronouns may act as substitutes for the copula, though they
are often seen in union with locative adverbs (as ga, etc.): bufe uma
bu-ga-do that is his father = “his father is there”; gara ild bu-do
“another one this” = here is another; inyi ukware yi bu-do “goats two
is these” = here are two goats.
(4) fu, fru. It may go together with some of the verbs or equivalents
seen before
He is here i kpd fu (= afu) no. Where are they? ene {a) lai They are
there ene afu-gd = ene akpa fu-ga. Are the Dinka (there) ? anjange {a)fru 1
Yes anjange {a)fru nb = kpd {a)fru no.
(5) re{e) — Zande tini (some knowledge of Zande would help to under­
stand its characteristic use)
Have you a goat? inyiyi re{e) 1 “your goat is ... ?” (cf. Zande: gamo
meme tini ? gi meme tini). Our father is here (is found here ...) dvdne ree
{— ree). A parallel translation runs thus: 6umanye {i)re-no (pr. irana).","[54, 55]"

"Plural: short and long formsa) From my earlier informants I got only the longer forms. Here is
in full the conjugation and declension of the phrase: He came to catch
me, thee, him; us, you, them.
Pl. 1. ana amanye anvu
Sing. 1. ana ma anvu
2.
ana omuye anvu
2. ana mo anvu
3. ana t^ne anvu
3. ana fe anvu
[Note the construction of the sentence: He = silent + verb + ob­
ject of trans, verb + trans, verb: “To catch”.]
Two more sentences are added from the same informants:
Catch him! onvu fe\ Catch them! onvu tene\ They caught us with-noreason anvune amanyi kerekpa (= kere-kpa).
b) From my later informants, cleverer and similarly more conversant
with their mother tongue, I got only the shorter forms, with the ex­
ception of amunye, which was given together with muu, for the 2nd
pers. plural. Here are examples of full conjugations with the pers.
pronouns, showing their use.
Sing. 1. amd aviri I am Birri
2.
mu (a) bodo; mu gbaya you are Bodo, you are Zande
3.
te aviri he is Kare
Pl. 1. mad (kpa) aviri we are Birri
2.
muu (= amuye) gbaya you are Zande
3.

y(e) aviri sa he is not Kare
Pl. 1. mad aviri sa we are not Birri
2.
muu gbaya sa you are not Zande
3.
ene aviri sa they are not Kare
The conjugation of the phrase “I am here” or “present” runs as fol­
lows: sing, ma kpa(a) no, mu ..., (y)i ...; pl. mad ...; muu ..., ene
kpa(a) no. We are all men mad afwe ulu.

[The additions, e.g. di thing ..., have been recorded as obtained
from the “mouths” of the natives, not to alter the original text.]
A conclusion which applies to both A) and B) is that several couples
of items of the conjugation of verbs with pers. pronouns are differ­
entiated only by tone.
[The conjugation of Birri verbs resembles closely that of the BongoKresh groups, to which it should be compared (cf. my Bongo, nn.
109—117; Yulu and Kara MSs, XII B). It resembles most closely
Aja, with which it has in common, as for the pers. pronoun, the suffix
ne (= ni in Aja) for the 3rd person plural.]Referring pronouns in conjugation (cf. above: IV, 1, iii).
Many more examples are availble for the future, but even the few in
the past are sufficient to show their use.
He said: He (himself) ate already (or before) ayi-ka-. n-onyo kawada.
They said: They themselves ate before ayini-ka'. n-onyo gangi-ne-ne
kawada', or simply: n-onyvne kawada (they ate before).
ii. FutureThere are two constructions, both very common:
a) na acts as the future prefix. Examples:
To-morrow we shall eat porridge amundri mana a6a (= porridge) onyo.
We shall eat to-morrow amundri mana ede (= thing) onyo.
The future prefix na is common to Bongo (cf. my Bongo, nn. 117 —
118), one of the many links between the two languages, but it is surpris­
ing to find it also in Mondu (cf. my Mondu MS, XII, 2).",[42]
