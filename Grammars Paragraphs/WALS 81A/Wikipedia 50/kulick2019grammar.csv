"9.1 Simple sentences
A simple sentence in Tayap may consist of no more than an inflected verb. Thus,
a complex predicate like the serial verb construction discussed throughout the
previous chapter, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana ‘she intends to carry him down on her
shoulders’ is a fully formed sentence in Tayap. A simpler example is:
(9-1) puko
come_up.3pl.r
‘they came up’
Word order is relatively flexible, since the grammatical relations of core constituents and other elements are expressed through morphology and potentially
marked on NPs by case clitics like the ergative. However, Tayap is a verb-final
language and the unmarked order of elements in a declarative intransitive
sentence is Subject-Verb (SV), and in a declarative transitive sentence SubjectObject-Verb (AOV):
subject
verb
(9-2) a. prerikin
pipiek-ara
sweet_potato burn.3sg.f|1pl.r-perf
‘the sweet potato burned’https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-009Simple sentences251subject

b. Merew-ŋgro=gi munje
par-ŋgɨ-ro
Sanae-pl=erg.pl man
bury.r-3sg.m.r.o-3pl.r.s
‘the Sanae villagers buried the man’
In transitive clauses that contain a subject, an object, and an oblique argument,
the order of object and oblique is fairly free, with the caveat that the object
never follows the verb, while the oblique argument can. Also, the subject normally occurs in the sentence-initial position. Some examples of various word
orders follow:

‘his two wives heard the conch shell’
Verbless clauses also exist. The subject precedes the complement. For example:
(9-5) ŋa ainda
1sg dx
‘It’s me’2529 Simple and complex sentences(9-6) omɨndeomɨnde yum=ke?
spouse.pl
2pl=q
‘Are you my lovers?’
Negated verbless clauses use the general negator wákare, which occurs finally:
(9-7) ŋa tam ror wákare
ŋa tam ror
wákare
1sg bird child neg
‘I’m not a baby bird’9.2 Complex sentences: Coordinate, subordinate
and cosubordinate clauses
Complex sentences consist of coordinate, cosubordinate or subordinate structures. The following suffixes and free morphemes function to express these
clause types.
Clause-coordinating suffixes (conjunctions):
Sections 9.3.1, 9.3.2-(y)a ‘and’
-api ‘then’, ‘afterwards’Clause-coordinating words:
Sections 9.3.3, 9.3.4ŋgɨ(na)napi
ayáta‘therefore’, ‘for that reason’
‘never mind that’, ‘even
though’, ‘it doesn’t
matter that’Clause-subordinating suffix
and words:
Section 9.4-re
pi
pime
ndɨ‘if’, ‘when’, ‘while’, ‘because’Clause-cosubordinating suffixes
(medial-final chains)
Section 9.8
Other complex clause combining
(see Section 9.10)hypothetical-ra ‘modifier’
-kar ‘manner’
-rar ‘multiplicative’Coordinated clauses2539.3 Coordinated clauses
9.3.1 Coordinated clauses with conjunctive –(y)a (‘and’)
The simplest way to link verbs in Tayap is to add a conjunctive morpheme -a (realized as -ya after a vowel) glossed as ‘and’ to fully inflected verbs that occur in a
series. Verbs linked in this manner express sequentiality: X happened, then Y
happened, then Z happened, and so on.
For example:
(9-8) a. Konjab adɨmbota sindineta turonɨ siniet
Konjab adɨmbot
-a
sindi -net
-a
Konjab trip.sg.m.r -and slip.r -1sg.m|3sg.m.r -and
turo =nɨ
siniet
slope =loc go_down.sg.m.r
‘Konjab tripped, lost his footing and slid down the slope’
b. yu urekteta raretet!
yu urek
-tet
-a
rare
-tet
2sg turn.sbj -2sg.m.r -and look.sbj -2sg.m.r
‘turn around and look!’
All the clauses linked together in this way are independent clauses. For example:
(9-9)mbuspimbroya nda ŋgɨ prɨke
mbuspi -mb
-ro
-ya
nda ŋgɨ prɨke
send.r -3pl.r.o -3pl.r-s -and dm 3pl come_up.dl.r
‘They sent them off and the two came [back] up [to Gapun].’(9-10) a. yum aikiya ŋanana orákaŋgar apukru wákare

ŋa =nana orákaŋgar
2pl come.irr-irr -and 1sg =dat

‘you all didn’t come and cook any food for me’
b. ŋɨŋi okɨya minjike moserkruya aikiya ŋare mbudjikru wákare

-ki

wákare
-and come.irr -irr -and 1sg =all sell.irr -3sg.f.irr.o neg
‘he didn’t go and buy betel nut and come and sell it to me’
Note that in both examples in (9-10), even though the negating word wákare
appears only once, the scope of negation covers all verbs, and all verbs appear in
the irrealis form that they take when negated:
ai-ki
come.irr-irr
apu-kru
cook.irr-3sg.f.irr.o
o-kɨ
go.irr-irr
moser-kru
buy.irr-3sg.f.irr.owákare
negai-ki
come.irr-irr
mbudji-kru
sell.irr-3sg.f.irr.o
However, the scope of negation can also cover just the final independent clause:
see below, example (9-11c).
Note that these structures are considered to be series of independent coordinated clauses. It is possible to consider them as single complex predications,
particularly as the scope of negation can cover the whole coordinated series. But
an analysis of coordinated clauses is preferred here, since each of the verbs is
a fully inflected independent verb, which can take its own overt NP arguments
as individual clauses do, and which can stand on its own. In addition, there is
an overt linker joining the clauses, making an analysis of a single predicate less
viable (Haspelmath 2016: 296).
It is also possible to consider these sequences as medial-final chaining
(cosubordinate) constructions (Longacre 2007: 398). However, the non-final verbs
receive the full range of inflections, as do the final verbs. In medial-final chains
the non-final verbs are cosubordinate (see below, Section 9.8). For those reasons
it seems best to treat these sequences as independent coordinated clauses.
Coordinate clauses do not have to share subjects, and as examples (9-11c
and d) show, they can be independently negated:Coordinated clauses255(9-11) a. ŋgɨgi ŋa utawtioya ŋa katɨtet awinnɨ

‘they didn’t push me and I fell in the water’
All these examples contain separate clauses, each one headed by fully inflected
independent verbs. The first two examples express a sequential relationship
between the actions: they pushed me and then I fell (9-11a); the woman saw the
man, and then the two of them chased the pig, and then the man speared the
pig (9-11b). This relationship of sequentiality is the most common implication of
clauses joined with -a.","[270, 271, 272, 273, 274, 275]"
"The ergative case (erg)119Suter’s (2010) description of optional ergativity in the Trans New Guinea
language Kâte shows that the ergative marker is most likely to be used in
clauses with the marked word order of OSV (as opposed to the usual SOV) or
when a focus particle is used on the subject (Suter 2010: 435). In other Trans
New Guinea languages, factors include animacy, agency and control (Suter
2010: 436).
As we have seen, however, there seems to be no single factor or group of
factors which account for the use or absence of the ergative marker in Tayap.","[138, 139]"
"Most of these kin terms, and certainly their dual and plural forms, are moribund. Several of them – oiŋga ‘daughter-in-law, woman speaking’, njanimb
‘great-grandchild’, ombre ‘father-in-law, male speaking’, otre ‘mother-in-law,
male speaking’ – were produced only after several conversations among Gapun’s
oldest Tayap speakers. There is disagreement about whether one of them – eŋki,
‘husband of maternal aunt, male speaking’ – is even a Tayap word. Several people
suggested that it might be a borrowing from the Adjora language spoken in theNouns53nearby village, Sanae. However, since old men in the 1980s told me it was, and
since it has a Tayap plural, I include it here.
Villagers under forty all know common words like munje ‘man’, noŋor ‘woman’
and ror ‘child’, and they know their plural forms, but most do not know their dual
forms. Most kin terms have been either forgotten or replaced with words from Tok
Pisin. So oyeŋg ‘in-law’ has been replaced by Tok Pisin’s “tambu”, neni ‘grandfather’ has been replaced with “apa man”, and keke ‘grandmother’ with “apa meri”.
Words like mambrag ‘spirit of a dead person’ and kandap ‘forest being’ are kept
alive by mothers who use them to frighten their small children, so everyone knows
them. The plural forms, however, are not known by speakers under thirty-five.
The two non-human nouns that have plural forms are:
SingularPluraldognjenjenumpigmbormboreirum3.1.2 The animacy/genericness distinction in nouns
The animate-inanimate/generic distinction is fundamental in Tayap, and is
marked by two kinds of morphemes that are attached to nouns.
The first are peripheral case clitics, that denote relations like location or
dative (see Section 4.4). Several of these clitics have different forms for animate
and inanimate/generic referents. Note, for example, the different clitics that
express movement towards something or someone – an animate referent takes
=re and an inanimate referent takes =nɨ (see Section 4.4 for the complexities of
the animate/inanimate division):
(3-12) a. ŋgu
Mairum =re
wok
3sg.f Mairum =all (animate) go.3sg.f.r
‘she went to Mairum (personal name)’
b. ŋgu
mɨri
=nɨ
wok
3sg.f rainforest =all (inanimate) go.3sg.f.r
‘she went to the rainforest’
3.1.2.1 Animacy/genericness marked through possessive morphemes
Animacy/genericness is also marked on NPs by the enclitics that signal possession
(see Section 4.5 for discussion of possession). The possessive clitics express animacy/543 Word classesgenericness and number. They have optional consonant-final forms: The conditioning factors between the vowel-final and consonant-final forms are unknown.animate
inanimate/genericsingularplural=ma(t)
=ŋa(n)=mandama(t)
=ŋa(n)Examples are:
(3-13) a. mbor =mat ŋgagon
pig
=poss tail
‘pig’s tail’
b. Sopak =mat sapwar
Sopak =poss basket
‘Sopak’s basket’
c. mɨri
=mat mbor
rainforest =poss pig
‘wild pig’ – as opposed to a numŋa mbor, a domestic pig, of the village
d. num
sami =mat morasi
village many =poss custom
‘the custom of many villages’
The possessive clitics attach to the last word of the noun phrase expressing the possessor. The order between possessor and possessed is free, so both Sopak=ma(t)
sapwar (Sopak’s basket) and sapwar Sopak=ma(t) (basket Sopak’s), or mɨri=ŋa
mbor (forest’s pig) and mbor mɨri=ŋa (pig forest’s) are possible. Placing the np +
poss constituent last emphasizes it.
For animate plurals, the possessive clitic is =mandama(t). For example:
(3-14) a. Potow
=mandamat morasi
Wongan =poss.pl
behavior
‘the behavior of the Wongan people’
b. mbor rorsem =mandama tawk
pig
child.pl =poss.pl
plate
‘the baby pigs’ plate’ (that they eat from)
When speaking in general terms, =ŋa(n) is used even with animate nouns. For
example:Nouns55(3-15) a. munjeŋa morasi
munje =ŋa
morasi
man

‘the behavior of man’ (as opposed to the behavior of pigs, or dogs)

3.1.3 Gender in nouns
Gender is a ubiquitous feature of Tayap. A common category in Papuan languages
in general (Foley 2000: 371), in particular in non-Trans New Guinea languages
(Ger Reesink pers. comm.), the pervasiveness of gender in Tayap, and the way it is
marked across the grammar, differentiates it from the languages that surround it
and gives it a reputation in the area as being a “hard” language.
Non-speakers of Tayap perceive the prominent role that gender marking
plays in Tayap because they hear speakers telling one another to do things, and
the imperative forms of intransitive verbs are inflected according to the gender
(and number) of the addressee(s).
So – to use the example that Gapun villagers themselves inevitably cite
whenever they explain the nature of Tayap to anyone – when you talk to a man563 Word classesyou say wetet (come), and when you talk to a woman you say wetak (come), using
gender-marked verbal affixes.
This feature of the language never ceases to astonish any Sepik villager who
hears it, and people from other villages who listen to Gapuners explain that they
have “two languages” invariably react as though such a language is so bizarre as
to stretch the bounds of credulity (see Section 7.1.2; see also Sections 3.5 and 5.3
for gender marking on pronouns and verbal affixes).
3.1.3.1 Gender marking
Gender in Tayap is a property of nouns, but is a morphologically covert category.
It is not marked not on the noun itself, but is expressed on the following targets:
(1) deixis markers (see Section 3.8); and/or
(2) ergative markers on the subjects of transitive verbs (see Section 4.3); and/or
(3) suffixes on the verb that encode subject and object (See Sections 3.5 and 5.3);
and/or
(4) suppletive verb stems (see Chapter 6)
For example, compare the following intransitive constructions:
(3-16) a. noŋor aŋgi patɨrnɨ wuk
noŋor
aŋgi patɨr =nɨ
wuk
woman dx.f house =loc be.3sg.f.r
‘the woman is in the house’
b. munje ainde patɨrnɨ kut
munje ainde patɨr =nɨ
kut
man
dx.m house =loc be.sg.m.r
‘the man is in the house’
Here, the gender of the subjects is expressed by both the deictic words (aŋgi/
ainde) and the gender of the inflected verb aku ‘be’ (wuk ‘she is’ versus kut
‘he is’).
Transitive verbs mark gender in object suffixes (see Section 3.5). Some classes
of transitive verbs (classes 4 and 5) signal gender and number on the subject suffix(es) as well. So compare the following non-future forms of the class 4 verb ŋgar
‘call out to’:
(3-17) a. ŋɨŋi ŋgu ŋganukun
ŋɨ=ŋi
ŋgu
ŋga
-nu -ku
-n
3sg.m=erg.m 3sg.f call_out.r -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
‘he called out to her’Nouns57b. ŋguyi ŋgu ŋgatukun
ŋgu
=yi
ŋgu
ŋga
-tu -ku
-n
3sg.f =erg.f 3sg.f call_out.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘she called out to her’
In both examples, the object suffix -ku signals a feminine object (a masculine
object would be -ŋgɨ; see Section 5.3.1). But in a class 4 verb like ŋgar, the gender
and number of the subject is also obligatorily marked: in this example, gender is
encoded in the alternation between -nu + -n (combining to signal 1sg or 3sg.m or
1pl), and -tu + -n (combining to signal 2sg or 3sg.f).
Notice also the different ergative markers affixed to 3sg.m (=ŋi) and 3sg.f (=yi).
Other verbs (conjugation class 3 transitive verbs and some intransitive verbs)
also change their stem forms to signal the gender of the subject:
(3-18) a. mbori pap okun
mbor=i
pap
o
-ku
-n
pig=erg.f coconut consume.r <3sg.f.r.o> -3sg.f.r.s
‘the (female) pig ate coconut’
b. mborŋi pap kakun
mbor =ŋi
pap
ka
-ku
pig
=erg.m coconut consume.r <3sg.f.r.o>
-n
-1sg|2sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
‘the (male) pig ate coconut’
Here, again, the object suffix -ku signals a feminine object, ‘coconut’, and thus
remains the same in both sentences. But the verb ‘consume’ (a) is a conjugation
class 3 transitive verb, and in those verbs, the verb stem changes to signal the gender
(and number) of the subject, alternating between o and ka (see Section 6.1.4).
This verb-stem alternation is a source of serious difficulty for young speakers
of Tayap, as is discussed in Section 6.1.5.","[72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77]"
"Grammatical words generally coincide with phonological words in Tayap
(however see Section 8.2, example (8–3) for a counter-example). Grammatical
words consist of “a number of grammatical elements which (i) always occur
together rather than scattered throughout the clause (…); (ii) occur in fixed order;
and (iii) have a conventionalized coherence and meaning” (Aikhenvald 2007: 2).
In Tayap, verbs are grammatical words which minimally must always occur
with person and/or status marking except in certain restricted morphosyntactic environments. Even the longest and most complex of the complex predicates
described in Chapters 8 and 9 consist of single grammatical words, sharing as they
do various properties like marking for arguments and/or realis/irrealis status. Thus
the example discussed in detail in Chapter 8, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana, ‘she intends to
carry him down on her shoulders’, is a single phonological and grammatical word.
However grammatical words do not necessarily have to be inflected. Verbs
are normally inflected, but nouns, pronouns, particles and other minor classes
can occur without inflection.",[64]
"4.3.2 Ergativity in the speech of young people
Young villagers under thirty who narrated stories for me in Tayap produced ergative constructions in their speech, but they had a tendency to overuse the ergative
markers on intransitive verbs. The subjects of intransitive verbs like ‘be’, ‘cry’,
‘stand’, ‘talk’, ‘shiver’ and ‘work’ were all marked with ergative case marking in
various young people’s narratives.
Even when used in transitive verb phrases, the ergative morpheme was
sometimes attached to constituents that were not the subjects of the verb. For
example, one twenty-three-year-old man narrated a story about how a young girl
had accused him of having raped her.
In telling the story, he said the following (note that the ellipsis denotes a
series of false starts and repetitions that have been omitted, and the ergative morpheme is highlighted in bold):
(4-38) Mosi katota namnin, ‘Ŋayarke yu Yengia…morasi aproyi nitukun’?
Mosi katot

-n
do.r -s
<3sg.f.r.o>
-2sg|3sg.f.r.s
‘Mosi went down and told me ‘Is it true that you did something bad to
Yengia?’1204 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionThere are semantic and grammatical errors in this sentence,2 but of interest here
is the ergative clitic, which the speaker attaches to the object noun phrase ‘bad
deed’ instead of to the subject of the verb phrase, ‘you’.
I suspect that this error occurred because the speaker seems to know that the
verb nir- (‘do’ or ‘make’) usually co-occurs with an ergative marker. But his sense
appears to be that the marker attaches to the noun or noun phrase that immediately precedes the verb; not necessarily the subject of the verb phrase.
This is a typical error made by speakers under thirty. It indicates that young
speakers have parsed the ergative case marker as a formulaic part of a verb
phrase involving certain verbs – in particular, the verbs ‘know’, ‘say’ and ‘do’.
But these speakers seem to be not entirely aware that the marker does particular
syntactic and semantic work. If the ergative case clitic was really a strong marker
of agency, control or animacy one might expect speakers to be aware of that,
albeit subconsciously, and make mistakes accordingly; however that does not
seem to be the case.
In addition to having problems with the placement and the function of
the ergative clitic, young speakers also often make mistakes of gender with it.
They overextend the feminine form =yi and use it when talking about males and
plural referents. So they say things like sas=yi (‘father=erg.f’, instead of sas=ŋi
‘father=erg.m’) and njenum=yi (dog.pl=erg.f, instead of the correct njenum=gi
‘dog.pl=erg.pl’).
This overextension of =yi probably occurs because =yi is the ergative ending
on the 1sg and 2sg pronouns (ŋa=yi and yu=yi). Speakers would have heard the
yuyi form all their lives, every time an older speaker ordered them to carry or take
or fetch or hit something. And since the narratives that people in Gapun tell one
another are almost invariably accounts of personal experiences – what the narrator him or herself saw, heard, dreamt, etc. – the ŋayi form would also be very
salient for speakers. Furthermore, the unmarked gender in Tayap is feminine see
Section 3.1.3. That young speakers would overextend the feminine form, rather
than the masculine =ŋi, is therefore not surprising.","[139, 140]"
"5 Basic verb morphology
5.1 General properties of Tayap verbs
In Tayap a single complex predicate can express the equivalent of an entire
sentence in English. This is most apparent in its serial verb constructions,
which can express a complex action like ‘she intends to carry him down on
her shoulders’ in a single predicate (tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana). Serial verb constructions like this are discussed in Chapter 8. For basic sentence structure, see
Section 9.1.
Transitivity, TAM (tense, aspect and mood) and realis/irrealis status are morphologically encoded in verbs by suffixes, with the object suffix preceding the
subject suffix.
In transitive verbs, this occurs in the following manner:
(5-1) a. poŋgro
po
verb stem ‘strike’
in realis-ŋg
-object/undergoer ‘him’
in realis-ro
-subject/actor ‘they’
in realis-ŋgrɨ
-object/undergoer ‘him’
in irrealis-ndak
-subject/actor ‘they’
in irrealis‘they hit him’
b. oŋgrɨndak
o
verb stem ‘strike’
in irrealis
‘they will hit him’
Intransitive verbs, too, signal both subject and status, but many of them tend to
do so in a more fusional manner than is the case for transitive verbs, especially in
the non-future tense (which expresses events or actions that are occurring in the
present or that have occurred in the past).
An example of intransitive verbs is the verb poror ‘sing’. Some of the forms
that this verb takes in the non-future and the future tenses are as follows:
(5-2) a. poror-net
sing.r-1sg.m|3sg.m.r

(except in certain modification constructions, see Sections 4.5.1 and 4.5.2), and
which also never occur without being marked for status, either realis or irrealis
(although some verbs, e.g. poror above have the same stem for both). The root
forms of these stems – that is, the forms that are available for derivational processes like nominalization, and the citation forms that are entered in the dictionary as the lexical entry for a verb – are the irrealis forms of the stem.
A note is in order on the terms “roots” and “stems” as they are used here.
Roots are the lexical parts of a word, the unanalyzable part left once the
affixes are all taken off. Stems are involved when inflectional affixes apply to
different forms of a root (Aikhenvald 2007: 38–40). So Tayap verb roots have
inflectional stems: that is, for instance, there are separate inflectional stems
for realis and irrealis. In this grammar, “stem” refers to the inflectional possibilities of a verb root, and “root” designates the basic underlying lexical part
of the verb.
Verbs in Tayap have the following structure:
V – O – (A)
V – (S)
Note that verbal morphology, unlike clausal relations, follows a nominativeaccusative alignment system.
Verbs in Tayap mark the following elements:
Status
Has the action of the verb happened or is happening? Has it not happened?
Tense, aspect and mood (TAM)
Is the action described by the verb occurring now? Is it completed? Has it happened or will it happen? Did it not happen? Temporal and modal relations like
these must be marked on the verb.
In transitive verbs, TAM is marked on the verb root, the object suffix and, if
there is one, on the subject suffix as well.","[155, 156, 157]"

Tayap examples in the grammar usually consist of four lines. The first is the Tayap
speech written in bounded, unsegmented words.
The second line is the same clause or sentence in which the words have been
separated into morphemes.
The third line is the interlinear gloss of the morphemes. The space separating
the morphemes in the second and third lines is larger than it is in most grammars
for reasons of readability. The usual manner of presentation, in which glosses for
morphemes are chained together in long, complicated strings, assumes readers
with a great deal of specialized knowledge, experience and patience. Separating the morphemes should make the glosses easier to process. The spacing does
admittedly make it a bit harder to see individual words, but those appear in the
first line of the examples.
The fourth line is the translation into English.
An example is as follows:
(1) Merewŋgrogi munje parŋgɨro
Merew -ŋgro =gi
munje par
-ŋgɨ
-ro
Sanae
-pl
=erg.pl man
bury.r -3sg.m.r.o -3pl.r.s
‘the Sanae villagers buried the man’
Suffixes are marked by hyphens (-) and clitics are marked with an equal sign (=).
In Tayap there are no prefixes, only suffixes, and enclitics rather than proclitics.
Some glossing conventions used throughout this grammar in the interlinear
glosses need to be noted. Tayap verbs – and other words – have a broad range of
meanings, and an o, for example, is consistently glossed as ‘strike’ in the interlinear glosses, but is translated to its context-specific meaning as ‘hit’, ‘stab’, ‘kill’,
etc. in the translation. Similarly, the Locative case has a broad range of meanings.
It is glossed as loc when it has a locational meaning but in other contexts it may
be glossed as temp for temporal, com for comitative or all for allative.
Further conventions need explanation are as follows:
The first is the pipeline symbol | which appears in example 3 below underneath the final morpheme -n. This symbol means that the morpheme it glosses
has more than one meaning. Disambiguation occurs through the use of pronouns
or nouns, or through context.
An S is used in glossing transitive verbs to show features of the subject. With
intransitive verbs, the person/number/status of subjects are marked in the language but there is no S in the gloss.
https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-202Conventions and abbreviationsXIXAnother convention concerns Tayap’s discontinuous subject markers. Some
verbs have subject morphemes that occur both before and after the object morpheme. An example is as follows:
(2) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
ŋgu
=yi
aram ta
-tɨ
-ŋgɨ
3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -r.s -3sg.m.r.o
‘she saw a snake’-n
-r.sIn this verb, the combination of -tɨ before the object morpheme and -n after the
object morpheme encodes either a 2sg or 3sg.f subject in realis status. The
pronoun ‘she’ disambiguates the subject to be 3sg.f, in this case. Since it is the
combination of the two discontinuous subject morphemes that produces meaning,
the labeling convention adopted here is to gloss the first subject morpheme
with ‘s’ (‘subject’), and to gloss the combined meaning of the two morphemes
under the second morpheme. The object morpheme in verbs like this case occurs
between the two subject markers, and is bounded by < > instead of hyphens, to
show that it intervenes between the two discontinuous subject markers.
So in this grammar, the example above is written as:
(3) ŋguyi aram tatɨŋgɨn
ŋgu
=yi
aram ta
-tɨ
3sg.f =erg.f snake see.r -s‘she saw a snake’-ŋgɨ
-n
<3sg.m.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r.sThe abbreviations used in the interlinear glosses otherwise generally follow the
Leipzig glossing rules.
Note that the dictionary uses some different terms and abbreviations (see
page 351 for those).","[9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"

In the following example, it is not actually a single noun that is verbalized, but an
NP – in this case a possessive NP. Verbalized nouns often carry an inchoative meaning.

The lexical class of verbs is an open class which can be characterized as being
able to host realis/irrealis status and transitivity suffixes as well as subject and
object suffixes. A fully inflected verb can function as the sole word of a sentence.
There are two major subclasses of verbs: intransitive and transitive. Examples
of each are:
Intransitive verb
(3-28) ŋgu pirok
ŋgu
pirok
3sg.f laugh.sg.f|1sg.pl.r

ŋa=yi
yu ta
-n -u
-n
1sg=erg.f 2sg see.r -s <2sg.r.o> -sg|1pl.r.s
‘I saw you’
There are no ditransitive verbs in Tayap (see also Section 9.1). Semantically threeplace predicates express the recipient of giving, for example, with the benefactive
morpheme:
(3-30) is
-iata
-n
give.sbj -1sg.ben.r.o -sg|1pl.r
‘(you) give it to me!’
However the recipient can be omitted, indicating that the verb in question is transitive, not ditransitive, and that the benefactive morpheme is an optional oblique
argument:
(3-31) epi
i
-kru
-net
tomorrow give.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -1sg.m|3sg.m.irr.s
‘I (m) will give it (to someone) tomorrow’
Benefactive objects and regular objects cannot coocur in the same clause.
As well as being divided into transitivity classes, every Tayap verb falls
into one of nine conjugation classes, based on how verbs form their non-future
forms: there are five classes for transitive verbs and four for intransitives (see
Chapter 6).
Verb morphology in Tayap is entirely suffixing, with morphemes for object
and subject added – in that order, apart from discontinuous subject markers – to
verb stems. A characteristic feature of Tayap verbs is that status is marked across
the verb multiple times. The stem must occur in either an irrealis or realis form.
In addition, the object and subject morphemes that get suffixed to the stem also
encode realis/irrealis status.
This can be illustrated with an example from the transitive verb stem o, which
means ‘strike’ (and covers actions like ‘shoot’, ‘stab’ and ‘hit’). Note how irrealis
vs. realis is marked across the verb (in bold):Verbs65(3-32) a. pokun
po

-n

-sg|1pl.r.s

b. okrunet

c. okru wákare
o
-kru

The same thing happens with intransitive verbs, exemplified here with the verb
memkɨ ‘get up’:
(3-33) a. pemiet
pem
-iet
get_up.r -sg.m.r
‘he got up’ or ‘I (m) got up’ or ‘you (m) got up’
b. memkɨnet

c. memkɨ wákare

get_up.irr -irr neg
‘(Any pronoun, person or number of people) didn’t get up’ (or ‘won’t

Status2marking on verbs, while mandatory, does not always occur in predictable
ways. Realis morphemes can occur as part of a verb that refers to an unreal event.
An example is the counterfactual mood (cf), which is a prototypical irrealis category, because it refers to events that never occurred, such as ‘If he had seen it, he
would have shot it’. However in Tayap, on transitive verbs, the counterfactual is2 Note that the negative verb requires irrealis marking, see Section 5.4.2.1.","[82, 83, 84, 85]"

"5.2 Standard negation in transitive and intransitive verbs
5.2.1 Negation of transitive verbs
In order to understand what happens to a Tayap verb when it is negated, compare
the following forms of the transitive verb ‘consume’ in the non-future and future
tense:Standard negation in transitive and intransitive verbs139(5-3) a. ŋɨŋi mborsip kakun

consume.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -3pl.irr.s-n
-3sg.f.r.sLeaving aside everything else that is happening with this verb, look at the
verb stem. Note that the stem changes between the non-future tense, where it
appears as both ka (for 1sg, 2sg, 3sg.m and for 1pl subjects) and o (for 3sg.f
and 3pl subjects), and the future, where the stem is realized as a for every
subject.
This being the case, how does one know whether the verb root of ‘eat’ is ka or
o or a, or something else entirely?
This becomes clear when the verb is negated. Negation strips a verb of
everything but its irrealis stem and an irrealis object suffix (for transitive verbs),
or its irrealis stem and a marker of status (for intransitive verbs).","[158, 159]"
"4.1.1 Noun phrase structure
Noun phrase structure is as follows:
[PossP Part HEAD Mod* Quant]=case
PossP is a possessive phrase and Part is a participle; the head follows these. In the
Mod(ifier) slot, either an adjective or a numeral, or both, in that order, can occur,
or a relative clause, or alternatively a possessive phrase. Non-numeral quantifiers
follow, and the final element of an NP is a case-marking clitic. The head noun
itself can be reduplicated.
Noun phrases themselves are readily elided, but if an NP is present, its head
is obligatory, or very rarely elided if retrievable from context. The head appears
together with any applicable case marking. The head can be a noun, modified or
not, or a pronoun. Some examples follow:
Subject NP expressed by free pronoun:
(4-1) ŋgɨ nam tankuro
ŋgɨ nam ta
-n -ku
-ro
3pl talk hear.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -3pl.r.s
‘they heard the talk’https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-0041064 Noun phrases: Structure, modifiers, case marking and possessionNumeral following the noun it modifies:
(4-2) nɨmɨr sene
stick two
‘two sticks’
Dative-marked noun functioning as oblique:
(4-3) ŋgomar =ana ŋgwok
fish
=dat go.3pl.r
‘they went for fish.’
Head noun modified by adjective and numeral:
(4-4) patɨr mokop manaw
patɨr mokop manaw
house little
three
‘three little houses’
Relative clause in modifier slot:
(4-5) ŋgɨ ŋgomar tarkwanŋgukŋa
ŋgɨ ŋgomar tar
-kwan
-ŋguk =ŋa
3pl fish
take.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o -3pl.r =poss
‘they who were picking up fish’
Possessive modifier preceding and numeral following the head noun:
(4-6) ŋgan
nomb sene
3pl.poss name two
‘their two names’
The PossP element can be a possessive pronoun, e.g. yimen nirŋgar ‘our girlfriend’
or a full possessive NP:
(4-7) munjenum =mandama kokɨr
man.pl
=poss.pl
head
‘the heads of men’Participles with the non-finite suffix -(ŋ)gar107The head can be reduplicated, in the following cases to indicate plurality. The
first example has a rather complex structure, with ‘spouse’-‘spouse’ modified by
‘two’, all of which is taken up in the possessive pronoun ‘their’:
(4-8) ŋan omɨnde omɨnde sene ŋgan nomb sene ŋgankun
ŋan
omɨnde omɨnde sene ŋgan
nomb sene
3sg.m spouse spouse two 3pl.poss name two

-ku
3sg.f thing thing throw.irr -3sg.f.r.o.s

nouns, for example:
(4-10) Pepe ŋgu

‘Pepe, she was leading.’

mbumjor
ŋɨ
tɨ
nder =eke mbet
mbumjor_snake 3sg.m
too path =perl come.sg.m.r
‘the mbumjor snake he too came along the path’
Note: A mbumjor snake is an extremely venomous black snake with shiny black skin
and blue stripes, well known to villagers because of the numerous deaths for which they
are responsible.","[125, 126, 127]"
"3.1.3.3 Non-particular nouns
Nouns that otherwise could be expected to be masculine can be feminine under
two circumstances.
The first is when the subject or referent of a verb is a general class of people
rather than a named or known individual. For example, the following utterance
is from a harangue by an older Tayap speaker who is chastising younger villagers for behaving badly. In the course of his harangue, the speaker wonders
rhetorically which big man (i.e. which old, knowledgeable man) is still alive to
teach young people about the good ways of the past. (The answer, he knows,
is ‘none’.)
His question was phrased as follows:
(3-22) Ani munje suman wuk?
who man
big
be.3sg.f.r
‘Which big man is here (i.e. still living)?’
Note that the verb ‘be’ is inflected in 3sg.f, even though the referent is unambiguously a male. The use of the feminine form here conveys generality. It refers to
the category or class of ‘big men’ rather than to a specific big man. If the speaker
had phrased the question using the 3sg.m form of ‘be’, kut, the question would
be referring to a specific named or known big man: ‘Which one of the big men we
all know is present here right now?’
Another example of the same phenomenon is the following (feminine forms
that denote the male referent are in bold):Nouns61(3-23) ŋgu munje ŋgo ŋgon pawrɨk tatukundre, nirkwanuk, noni namkru wákare

‘The man is of course finding his strength and doing it on his own,
nobody else is telling him to’
This utterance was spoken during a tense discussion about the incessant and disruptive drinking in the village that, by late 2009, had been plaguing Gapun for
some time. During a village-wide meeting, the mother of a fifteen-year-old boy
shouted angrily that her husband never tried to stop their son from drinking.
In response, a man in his late thirties made the comment above, which is
dismissive of the mother and supports the young man’s father by implying that
it wouldn’t matter what the father told his son. The son, this man is saying, is old
enough and would act according to his own desires anyway: no one is ordering
him to drink; he does it because he wants to. But as in the previous example,
(3-22), this utterance refers to a male using feminine grammatical forms.
The rhetorical effect is the same: the speaker’s use of feminine grammatical
forms when talking about a male conveys a meaning of generality. The speaker
is not overtly disputing anything the mother says about her son or her husband,
these grammatical forms say; he is making a general observation.
A non-literal but semantically more accurate translation of the man’s remark
would be: ‘As young men get older and stronger of course they decide on their own
what they want to do, they don’t do things just because other people tell them to’.
3.1.3.4 Gender in young people’s Tayap
Young speakers are aware that Tayap marks gender, and they know how to mark
it on verb stems, object suffixes, subject suffixes and through ergative markers.
A problem they have, though, is keeping straight the forms that mark masculine gender from the ones that mark feminine gender. This problem can be exemplified by a short extract from a narrative told by an eighteen-year-old woman.
This young woman is telling a story about a crocodile that she and some other
young women caught in the mangrove swamp. The women tied the 1.5 meter-long
crocodile’s jaws together, put it in a copra bag and brought it home. It lived for a
while, then, the speaker recounts, her father killed it (forms that express gender
are in bold):623 Word classes(3-24) orem aŋgi wuk embre sasŋi poŋgɨn

-sg|1pl.s
‘the (female) crocodile was there, in the morning (male) father killed him’
All the words and morphemes that express gender are correctly formed. The masculine ergative case morpheme on ‘father’ is also the correct one. But note that
the grammatical gender of the crocodile here changes from feminine to masculine
in the course of a single utterance. Crocodiles are generally masculine in Tayap,
so the final verb here, poŋgɨn, is exactly what a fluent speaker would say. But the
deictic word used by this young speaker, aŋgi, as well as the first verb, wuk, are
semantically incorrect – they are the feminine forms, but what the speaker wants
are the masculine forms: ainde kut.
If the speaker had been talking about a female crocodile (for example if the
crocodile had been found to be carrying eggs), then the deictic aŋgi and the verb
wuk would have been correct. But in that case, the final verb should have had a feminine object morpheme – it should have been po-ku-n (kill.r-3sg.f.r.o-sg|1pl.s).
This kind of gender-mixing is characteristic of young speakers. Generally
speaking, the younger and less competent the speaker, the more gender will be
mixed in haphazard ways like this. As in many other areas of Tayap grammar, it
is clear that young speakers know that a particular distinction is expressed in the
vernacular. They are also capable of producing some of the forms that mark the
distinction. What they lack is the capacity to realize the distinction in a grammatically consistent manner.
In Young People’s Dyirbal, a situation of language death in Australia, weaker
speakers changed the semantic gender assignment system to a simple animacy/
gender system. That is, they kept the morphology and rearranged the class assignment system (Schmidt 1985). That is the opposite situation to what is happening
with Tayap: here, the assignment principles remain but what is changed is that
the morphological marking has become inconsistent.","[80, 81, 82]"
"7.1.2.1 Intransitive imperatives
The imperative forms of intransitive verbs are the single most salient grammatical feature of Tayap, both for the speakers of Tayap and for everyone else in the
lower Sepik area who has ever heard of the language. Whenever Tayap speakers talk about their vernacular, they merrily tell anyone who is willing to listen
that Tayap “is broken into a woman’s language and a man’s language” (“i bruk
long tok ples bilong ol meri na tok ples bilong ol man”). If you want to talk to a
woman, they explain patiently, you have to use the “women’s language” (“tok
ples bilong ol meri”). If you want to talk to a man, you have to use the “tok ples
bilong ol man”.
Anyone who has followed this grammar this far knows that Tayap does indeed
have a number of gender-specific forms, such as the difference in first-person
forms for intransitive verbs inflected in the non-future tense (a male says ŋa mbot
‘I went’; a female says ŋa mbok; see Section 6.2). But this particular gendered
distinction is not primarily what the villagers have in mind when they talk about
how their language is broken in two.
Instead, the villagers who describe Tayap in that way are referring to a single
feature of grammar, namely the different forms that the imperative of an intransitive verb takes when it is addressed to a woman or to a man. The dramatic way
villagers describe this feature of their grammar, however – that you have to speak
to men and women using their specific “languages” – makes it seem as though
the entire Tayap language is “broken” in two.
The villagers’ exegesis carries the unspoken implication that even parts of
speech like nouns have female and male forms, and that both those forms must
be mastered in order to be able to talk at all. Non-Gapuners who listen to Gapun
villagers describe Tayap in this way always react with understandable dismay,
and they inevitably shake their heads in wonder that a human language could
possibly be so complex. Some of them then go off and augment the complexitySubjunctive (sbj)203further, informing others that, in fact, Tayap is “broken” into four languages: one
for women, one for men, one for girls and one for boys.
Gapuners’ story about Tayap’s difference from other vernacular languages
must have arisen because no other language in the area marks gender on the
imperative forms of intransitive verbs. This is a salient feature of language
because whenever villagers from different places meet, one way many of them
enjoy spending time is to quiz one another on what one calls common objects –
‘betel nut’, ‘lime’ (for chewing betel nut), ‘tobacco’, ‘pig’, ‘dog’ and ‘sago jelly’
are the inevitable ones – in their respective vernaculars.
Once these words have been exchanged, many people then go on to ask
about simple verbs: “How do you tell someone to come?”, they ask each other;
“How do you say ‘go’?”. Anyone asking a Tayap speaker that question will
receive the spiel about the vernacular being “broken in two” in response, and
so the story about the bizarreness of the little language that really is two – or is
it four? – separate languages gets perpetuated and spread throughout the lower
Sepik area.
Despite the hype, however, the imperative form of an intransitive verb is
a simple construction. All it involves is (a) a verb stem inflected to express a
speaker’s wish that another person do something – in other words, a verb stem
inflected in the subjunctive mood – and (b) a subject ending that marks gender
and number. So the imperative for any intransitive verb is formed in the following
way (recall that 2nd person dual uses the plural form; see the discussion that
precedes example (3-73)):subjunctive verb stem+
+
+-tet (2sg.m.r)
-tak (2sg.f.r)
-nkem (2pl.r|dl)The subjunctive stem of a verb is almost always the same as the form that verb
takes in the irrealis status. Examples are:
(7-2) a. male
addresseeb. female
addresseepruk-tet

‘You all go!’muŋgo-nkem
stand.sbj-2pl.r
‘You all stand!’pruk-nkem
work.sbj-2pl.r
‘You all work!’In all the examples above, the stem form of the verb in the subjunctive is identical to the stem form of those verbs in the irrealis status. There are exceptions to
this pattern (for intransitive verbs; transitive verbs have exceptions discussed in
7.1.2.2), however, such as the following, where the verbs have a subjunctive-specific form:
(7-3) a. ai (irr) ‘come’ → we- (sbj, so: we-tet, we-tak, we-nkem; see example
7-1 above)
b. tutu (irr) ‘sit’ → tuto- (sbj, so: tuto-tet, tuto-tak, tuto-nkem)
Verb roots ending in r gain the vowel e before the imperative ending, which is
also stressed:
(7-4) a. rar (irr) ‘ look’ → raré- (sbj, so: raré-tet, raré-tak, raré-nkem)
b. sir (irr) ‘descend’→ siré- (sbj, so: siré-tet, siré-tak, siré-nkem)
If these exceptions only occurred in the imperative mood, it would be possible to
simply classify them as exceptions and maintain that the stem form of an imperative verb is its irrealis form. However, the stem forms of verbs in the imperative mood are also the forms that occur for verbs inflected to express an indirect
command (see below 7.1.4). This fact indicates that the underlying form for imperative forms is a subjunctive wish – in other words, ‘You go!’ takes the grammatical
form of ‘(I want that) you go!’.
For that reason, the stem forms of verbs inflected in the imperative are classified as subjunctive rather than irrealis, even though their realization in speech is
most often identical with the irrealis forms.","[222, 223, 224]"

The progressive morpheme -rɨk has the same form as the counterfactual morpheme (see Section 9.4.3). The counterfactual morpheme, however, is always
stressed, whereas the progressive -rɨk is always unstressed.
Progressive verbs formed with -rɨk also have a different stress pattern from
progressive verbs formed with -ak. Verbs with -ak take stress on the final syllable
of the verb stem. Progressive verbs formed with -rɨk or -ruk take stress on the final
syllable of the inflected verb.
Temporality on progressive verbs is expressed by the fully inflected final verb
‘be’. Thus, a future progressive is formed as follows:

The progressive aspect for transitive verbs is formed in the same manner as for
intransitive verbs, except that in the place of the progressive morpheme, a benefactive object morpheme appears. The pattern is as follows:
irrealis verb stem
+
benefactive object
+
verb ‘be’, inflected for TAM, status and subject
Benefactive object morphemes are a distinct set of object morphemes that normally foreground possession or the fact that the action expressed by the verb
impacts on a particular entity. They are discussed in Section 7.5.
In the progressive, these morphemes always occur with a final n. They encode
the features of the transitive object, and have none of the associations with possession or that the verb impacts particularly upon the entity. Their forms are:

Transitive and intransitive progressive verbs are favored by the weakest
speakers of Tayap, and they are over-extended to express temporal relationships that more correctly would be expressed by the non-future tense. As
was discussed in Chapter 6, the non-future forms of Tayap verbs are irregular
and complicated to construct. In comparison, the progressive is easy: all one
needs to know in order to form it is the following:
(1) the irrealis verb stem (which doesn’t change for speaker or referent);
(2) the object (which will frequently be -kwan, the 3sg.f.ben.o form); and
(3) the correct form of the verb ‘be’, which would be heard hundreds of times
every day in the village.
This means that if you know the irr verb stem and the object (which, again, will
usually be the 3sg.f.ben.o form, -kwan), you have two-thirds of the verb formed.
All you need to complete it is the correct form of the verb ‘be’.
The weaker a speaker is, the more she or he will avoid talking about any
subject other than ‘I’, ‘you’, ‘he’, ‘she’ or ‘we’ – which means that there are only
three endings to choose from: -kuk (which expresses 1sg.f, 2sg.f and 1pl), -kut
(1sg.m, 2sg.m and 3sg.m) and -(w)uk (3sg.f).","[262, 263, 264, 265, 266]"
"2569 Simple and complex sentencesBut as (9-11c) shows, -a can also coordinate clauses that express a simultaneous rather than sequential relationship between the actions: Kama carried the
water and while she was carrying it, none of it spilled.
9.3.2 Coordination with -api ‘afterward’ (aft)
The suffix -api links clauses that encode actions that occur consecutively, one
after the other. It is affixed to a verb that is fully inflected for person, number and
TAM and takes its own arguments. The suffix marks that verb as an action that
was or will be completed before the action in the clause that follows it occurred
or will occur.
Like -a, -api can link clauses that involve either the same subject or different
subjects. Again, it joins full independent clauses.
Examples are:

Some speakers pronounce this form ŋgu(na)napi, which indicates that it might be
analyzed as ŋgu (3sg.f)+ the coordinating suffix -api. So: ‘after it’.
Ŋgɨnanapi (or ŋgɨnapi) is a freestanding word. It introduces a clause that
expresses cause or reason, thereby combining two main clauses:

Ayáta is a word most familiar to the villagers as an interjection of impatience or
dismissal, in its meaning of ‘Stop it! or ‘Never mind’ (see Section 3.10). It is this
latter sense of dismissal that is expressed when the word is used in a sentence as
a clause-coordinating conjunction.

9.4.1 Adverbial subordination with -re ‘when’, ‘if’, ‘while’ (sub)
The suffix -re (realized as -de after n) attaches as a suffix to fully inflected verbs
and marks a verb as expressing the background condition in relation to which the
action indicated in the main clause occurs. This backgrounding nature of subordination is emphasized by the order of the subordinate and main clauses in
Tayap: the subordinate clause always precedes the main clause.
In English, these are clauses that would be expressed with the subordinating
conjunctions ‘if’ and ‘when’. Unlike English, though, Tayap makes no distinction between ‘if’ and ‘when’, at least when referring to unreal events; both are
expressed by -re.
These clauses are semantically subordinate in that they specify a precondition for the action of the main clause to occur. They are not considered medialfinal (cosubordinate) constructions, as the non-final verbs are structurally quite
different, for instance they are not obligatorily irrealis (Section 9.8).","[275, 276, 277, 278]"
"6.1.1 Class 1: Verb stems that alternate between p and Ø
Verbs in this class consist of roots that contain the vowels o, e, i and u – in other
words, every vowel except a and ɨ. Verb roots frequently contain several of those
vowels, and it is not predictable which of the vowels will appear with the p.
In the realis stem, one of the above vowels in the root appears with a p. In the
irrealis, the p and the vowel that follows it does not appear. An example of a class
1 verb is ‘strike’, which has already been mentioned above (6-1a and b).
In the presentation that follows, the non-future forms are given first as examples of the realis stem, and they are followed by future forms of the same verb
as examples of the irrealis stem, in order to clearly illustrate the contrasts that

A glance through the above examples should make it apparent that it is not possible to predict which vowel in a verb stem will be preceded by a p in the realis form.
In the dictionary, verbs are listed under their root forms; that is, in the barest
irrealis forms they take when they are negated. A verb like ‘strike’, therefore, is
listed under o, along with an entry defining it as a class 1 transitive verb. That
‘class 1’ means that the verb listed, in its realis form, has a p either preceding it, or
following it (this position is specified in the entry). If the p appears in the middle
of the stem, this is indicated by parentheses. For example, the root form of ‘ask’
is written kotar-(p)-e.

it is not used in the example sentences.","[188, 189, 190]"
"328Tayap TextsI knew all three of these girls well. I knew, therefore, that their passive competence in Tayap was highly developed: the mother of the two sisters, and both
parents of speaker B, use a great deal of Tayap in day-to-day life, and all three girls
have no trouble understanding orders and following narratives in the language.
Despite this, the girls had little active competence in Tayap. The only things they
ever regularly uttered in Tayap were curse words like kwem petiek (wanker) or
ŋgwab (hole), which they delighted in hurling at each other and other children
numerous times during the course of a day.
To spare the girls what I feared might be the embarrassment of trying to speak
in Tayap and failing, I had not considered asking them to try to narrate a story.
They, however, had other ideas.
They knew that young women and men in their twenties regularly came up
into my house at night to tell stories in Tayap, and caught up in the excitement
of that, the three girls announced to me one afternoon that they, too, intended
to come and tell a story. And so they did. Each speaker told a short story, in the
collaborative and argumentative manner that characterizes the story below.
The stories produced by these young speakers are a glimpse into the future of
Tayap. The Tayap spoken by these girls is what the language will look like at the
very end of its life, when verb classes have imploded, when inflections for person
and number are jumbled, and when Tayap’s vocabulary has been more or less
completely replaced with Tok Pisin.
The speakers collectively make many of the errors discussed in the grammar,
including:
– overextension of the present progressive (lines 22, 26, 32–35, 45–46)
– inability to inflect class 2 and 3 verbs (lines 11–12, 31–36, 42, 61–65)
– semantic reduction of Tayap verbs on the model of Tok Pisin (lines 26–29)
– Tok Pisin verbs inflected with Tayap morphology (lines 11, 13, 23, 57)
– inability to correctly inflect verbs for subject (lines 13–15, 17, 21–22, 29, 35, 42, 61)
– loss of verbs of motion (lines 43–44)
– insecurity about the ergative (line 9)
In addition to those grammatical errors, this story is told disfluently and incoherently. In order to make any sense of it at all, I present, first, the same story told by
Speaker A in Tok Pisin.
As I mentioned in my commentary on Tayap Text 4, I always asked young
speakers to re-tell in Tok Pisin what they had just narrated in Tayap, so that I
could be reasonably certain of what it is they had wanted to say in Tayap, even if
the forms they used were incorrect or incomprehensible.
Here is fourteen-year-old speaker A’s narrative in Tok Pisin, followed by an
English translation. All the names in the narrative have been changed:Tayap Text 5: Girls have an adventure in the rainforest329Mi, Nensi, Mbabe, Marai. Mipela go, Nensi holim susu bilong Mbabe. Nensi kirap, sakim

"1.2 Past research on Tayap
The history of linguistic research on Tayap is very brief. In 1937, Gapun was visited
by one of the few white men ever to make it there. This was Georg Höltker, a
German S.V.D. (Societas Verbi Divini) missionary and anthropologist. Höltker
went to Gapun in the company of another missionary based in the coastal village
of Watam, and he spent three hours in the village. He took two photographs and
collected a word list.
A year later, Höltker published the list of 125 words, together with the weary
remark that “it will be awhile before any other researcher ‘stumbles across’
Gapun, if only because of the small chances of worthwhile academic yields in
this tiny village community, and also because of the inconvenient and arduous
route leading to this linguistic island” (1938: 280). (A translation of Höltker’s
short article is included here in Appendix 1, along with the two photographs he
took in Appendix 2).
Höltker’s brief squib remained all that was known about Tayap until the early
1970s, when the Australian linguist Don Laycock travelled around the lower Sepik
to collect basic vocabulary lists that allowed him to identify and propose classifications of the many languages spoken there. Laycock never visited Gapun, but
he did get as far as neighboring Wongan, and he interviewed two Gapun villagers who were staying there at the time, Kawi Waiki and Konjab Akumbi (Laycock
1973: 35).
On the basis of the word list and a few verb paradigms that he gathered
from Kawi and Konjab, Laycock classified Tayap (which he called “Gapun”) as a
sub-phylum of the Sepik-Ramu language phylum. In the classification terminology used by Laycock and his linguistic colleagues in the 1970s, this meant that
Tayap shared less than twelve percent of its basic vocabulary with other members
of the phylum, and also that it exhibited marked differences from other members
of the phylum – in Tayap’s case, gender pronouns and other differences relatedPast research on Tayap9to gender marking were mentioned. (The word list used by Laycock appears as an
appendix to his 1973 article. A discussion of the classifying criteria used to sort
out Papuan languages is in Wurm 1982: 65–72.)
Laycock included one other language in what he called the “Gapun
sub-phylum level family”. This was a language of over two thousand speakers, called Bungain. Bungain is geographically distant from Gapun (off to the
north and west of Map 1.2, see page 13), and Gapuners have no social, cultural
or economic ties or affinities with – or even knowledge of – Bungain speakers.
The relationship that Laycock postulated between Tayap and Bungain was not
based on any solid data or analysis – it was based on the basic vocabulary list
he used, as well as some rudimentary grammatical information, such as translations of ‘Give me tobacco’, ‘I cannot give you any, I have none’, ‘If I had some I
would give it to you’. Laycock himself noted that all his classifications of Sepik
languages were “tentative” and “impressionistic” (1973: 2). His description of
the supposed similarities between Bungain and Tayap, in its entirety, consists
of the following:
The languages show complex verb morphology, after the manner of Nor-Pondo languages
(subject marking by prefix in Bungain, and suffix in Gapun); but there is apparently no
noun classification, and no indication of number in nouns. Gapun has a third-feminine
pronoun; Bungain appears to lack this, but there is apparent gender concordance
in verbs.
(Laycock 1973: 35)Aside from the remark about complex verb morphology – which is a feature
shared by many Papuan languages – this description makes Bungain and Tayap
sound more dissimilar than similar (it also turns out that Tayap, in fact, does mark
number on a restricted class of nouns; see Section 3.1.3). In an attempt to assess
the feasibility of Laycock’s classification of Tayap and Bungain, I looked through
the field data on which he based the classification, namely his field notebooks D7,
D26 and D27, which are deposited in the Linguistics Department at the Australian
National University, where Laycock worked.2
Unfortunately, the notebooks turned out to be of quite limited use, because
Laycock often did not translate the vernacular words he noted down in his field
notebooks. He numbered the words, but his numbering does not correspond to2 I am grateful to the collective efforts of Melissa Crowther, Mark Donohue, Nicholas Evans,
Ewan Maidment, Doug Marmion, Malcom Ross and Nick Thieberger in helping me track down
and obtain scanned copies of these notebooks.","[28, 29]"
"A fragmentary word list of the Gapún language of New Guinea
In August-September 1937, when I was spending some time with the missionary
P. Josef Much, S.V.D., in the village of Wátam, the first coastal village South of
the Sepik outlet in New Guinea, in order to collect ethnographic and anthropographic observations, we also had the opportunity to go on a day trip to the village
of Gapún. On 6 September, we first travelled in a dugout canoe across the big
Wátam lagoon from Wátam to the village of Wánggan (approximately three hours
travelling time). Wánggan shares the same language as the villages of Kópar and
Síngrin located at the lower Sepik river, a language completely different to the
Wátam language. The next morning (7 Sept.), we crossed the lagoon towards the

and marshland until we reached Gápun.
Gapún is situated on top of a hill-crest, which on this side rises almost unexpectedly from the low-lying sago marshland up to a height of some 500 m. From
the hill-crest the eye has a free view over the lower Sepik lowlands. One can also
see the Marienberg [mission] station. According to the official census, Gápun
has only 33 inhabitants. The few and poor village houses are randomly scattered
across the hill-top, wherever the bare rock offers a couple of square meters of
building ground. The building structure, which makes skilful use of the existing
rock-formations as “stairs” or “house posts”, reminds me of similar conditions in
the villages on the island of Ubrúb.
Unfortunately, we only had that one day (7 Sept.) for our Gapún trip, since we
wanted to be back in Wánggan by evening. We went to the “spirit cave” famous
among all the local natives, which is situated a good one-hour walk Southwest of
Gapún. Apparently, no Kanaka [Ed. note: ‘no native’] has set foot inside this cave
out of fear of the spirits who are supposed to dwell there in snake form. We found
a small cave measuring a couple of square metres of ground area and of approximately 1.5m of height. It seems to have been formed by washouts. The walls
consist of clay-coloured sedimentary rock. We did not find any traces of artefacts
or human settlement. Supposedly, it used to be bigger in the past and it used
to have a second opening, as P. F. J. Kirschbaum, S. V. D., told me recently, who
years ago also visited the cave, something that all Kanakas still talk about with
admiration. Our visit will probably become similarly famous among the natives in
the foreseeable future, for even our relatively enlightened black carriers and cook
boys did not dare to enter the cave with us.
As the above details imply, P. Much and I unfortunately only had time for
a rest of some three hours in the village of Gapún itself. During this rest, we
recorded the following word list of the Gapún language with the help of some
older men. Consequently, we are not only aware that this list is of fragmentary
coverage; we also know that the individual words lack the desired level of certitude. Even though we made every effort to record and write down the data, as
any fieldworker knows, speech recordings are hardly ever free from fault at first
transcription and unless they are frequently counter-checked at a later point in
time. Nevertheless, it appears to me that the publication of this short word list
is not without value. According to the natives, the Gapún language is spoken
only in Gapún and has no relation whatsoever with other languages. With the
necessary reservations, the word list may thus provide comparative linguistics
with substantial research material, which may provide some clues, even if only a
hint, as to the classification of this language. What is more, it seems unlikely that
another researcher will “stumble across” Gapún any time soon, if only because of484Appendix 1the small chances of worthwhile academic yields in this small village community,
and also because of the inconvenient and arduous route leading to this linguistic island. The publication of the word list at this point and in this form is thus
reasonable and justified. The reproduction of the stock of phonemes follows the
conventions of the Anthropos Alphabet.2

"340Tayap-English-Tok Pisin DictionaryThe form of the verb stem that appears in negation is also the form that
constitutes the basis of all non-realis status and mood inflections; for example,
ir-kɨ-ndak ‘laugh.irr-irr-3pl.irr’ [they will laugh], and ir-ŋgarana ‘laugh.
irr-nd’ [X (any subject) better not laugh].
(2) The forms in the parentheses following the entry are the verb’s realis forms.
If the forms are regular, only a few will be listed, in order to allow a reader
to identify them by looking at Sections 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 of the Grammar. In the
case of ‘laugh’, a glance at Section 6.2.1 reveals that the endings -ot and -ok
indicate that ‘laugh’ is a Group IV intransitive verb, and that pirot means ‘I
(m) laughed’, ‘you (m) laughed’, or ‘he laughed’; pirok means ‘I (f) laughed’,
‘you (f) laughed’, ‘she laughed’ or ’we laughed’. The forms that verbs that
belong to this Group take for all other persons are found in that Section.
If the intransitive verb is irregular in realis, the irregular forms will be listed in the
parentheses following the entry.
Another example of an entry for an intransitive verb, this time for one whose
stem form does not change between realis and irrealis, is ‘say’, ‘talk’. The entry
for this verb looks like this:
namkɨ v.i. (-net/-nak), say, talk; tok.
This entry should be read to mean the following:
(1) The irrealis form of this intransitive verb is namkɨ, consisting of the verb
stem nam + the irrealis suffix -kɨ. This is the form the verb takes when it is
negated – so one says namkɨ wákare ‘X (any subject) didn’t/won’t talk’.
Once again, the irrealis suffix -kɨ is a morpheme separate from the verb
stem, but it is provided in the dictionary entry because there is no way of
knowing what the suffix is unless one sees it here.
The form of the verb stem that appears under negation is also the
form that constitutes the basis of all non-realis status and mood inflections; for example, nam-kɨ-ndak ‘talk.irr-irr-3pl.irr’ [they will talk], and
nam-ŋg rana ‘talk.irr-nd’ [X (any subject) better not talk].
(2) In those cases where all that follows an entry for an intransitive verb is
parentheses with endings like (-net/-nak), this means that the verb stem
remains the same between realis and irrealis. The realis person-endings of
these verbs can be reckoned through the following steps:
(a) remove the irrealis suffix -ki, -kɨ or -ku (in the case of ‘say’ or ’talk’, it is
-kɨ). This leaves only the verb stem (nam);
(b) suffix the appropriate subject endings to that stem.","[359, 360]"
"6.2.1 Four basic groups of intransitive verbs
Intransitive verbs have four basic sets of suffixes used on the realis stem to encode
the person, gender and number of the subject. They are as follows:

8.2.1) written with its irrealis marker (-kɨ, -ki or -ku), for two reasons: (a) in order to make it easier
to tell the difference between intransitive verbs and transitive verbs, which do not have irrealis
markers; and (b) to indicate which of the three irrealis morphemes is used on specific intransitive verbs. In addition, note that the various stem alternations such as (p/Ø), (p/w), (p/m), etc.
are indicated in the dictionary, under the proper entry. So the entry for eiwkɨ, for example, looks

encode gender and number. The markers that occur on NPs are:

plural number, so a word like rorsem=gi (‘children=erg.pl’) can refer to either
male or female children.
These ergative clitics are also attached to the personal pronouns in a pattern
that maintains the plural meaning of =gi but not the gendered meaning of =ŋi

wash my clothes in one of the village waterholes, I saw the rainbow and realized
that I didn’t know what it was called in Tayap. So I asked the first person I saw – a
fluent speaker of Tayap in his late thirties – what one calls a rainbow in Tayap.
“Renbo”, he responded, without missing a beat.
Um, no, I told him, that must be the Tok Pisin word – the Tayap word had to be
something else. The man told me that in that case, he didn’t know, and that I should
go ask his father, sixty-five-year-old Monei Mbanaŋ, who was my main language
informant at the time. I went off to find Monei and thus did my innocent query
launch a month of acrimonious debate from one end of the village to the other.
I found Monei sitting on his veranda and I asked him the word for rainbow.
He pondered for awhile. He told me he couldn’t remember the word offhand; he
needed to think about it. He thought for several days. Finally, he told me that
‘rainbow’ had no single word in Tayap; instead, ‘rainbow’ was expressed by the
verb phrase akɨn tamtiek, ‘cloud is marked with color’. This sounded reasonable
to me, and I duly recorded it. But when I repeated it to other speakers to check
their reactions, I was universally met with disdain. “Em giaman” – ‘He’s lying’,
everyone sneered, using their favorite expression to dismiss another speaker’s
expertise in Tayap. Even though no one could think of the correct term themselves,
they all told me they knew that the phrase Monei had volunteered was wrong.
Days went by and no one could come up with ‘rainbow’. Older villagers
explained to me that their parents and older relatives had warned them about
rainbows, saying they should never walk underneath one, because if they did,
their minds would become clouded and confused. But even though they remembered these cautions, no senior speaker could recall the word for ‘rainbow’
that their parents and relatives had used while articulating them. The word for
‘rainbow’, villagers told me, “i hait” – it was hiding. (In the villagers’ defense, I
should note that rainbows are not exactly common occurrences in Gapun – I only
saw that one the entire eight months I was there in 2009).
Eventually Monei’s old wife, Sopak Waiki, told me that she had a dream in
which the true word for ‘rainbow’ had been whispered to her by a dead ancestor.
The word, she revealed, was mɨnuomb – a word that otherwise means ‘large
round lake’. Sopak said that the way to say ‘rainbow’ in Tayap was to say akɨnnɨ
mɨnuomb utok, ‘a round lake appeared in the clouds’.
I told other senior speakers of Sopak’s revelation. They were unmoved. “Em
giaman”, they all pronounced, impassively.
A few days later, one of the oldest men in the village told me that he had
remembered the word – it was wagurmos.
The other speakers’ judgement fell predictably: “Em giaman”, they all said.
They explained that wagurmos meant the white film one sees in the sky at nightVillagers’ debates and language shift345– that is, the Milky Way. It doesn’t mean ‘rainbow’ at all. Many older speakers also
took the opportunity to disparage the linguistic knowledge of the old man who
had offered wagurmos. That speaker may be old, they said belittlingly, but he’s
“lapun nating” – he’s grown old without having learned anything. All he has,
people said, is “bebi sens” – the sense of a baby.
Weeks passed and frustration grew. But finally, having heard about the
senior speakers’ search for ‘rainbow’, a young man in his 30s one day came and
told me that he had once heard his grandfather, Kruni Ayarpa, say the word for
‘rainbow’. Kruni had been one of my language informants in the 1980s; he died
in the early 1990s. For the last few decades of his life, Kruni had been universally
respected and vaguely feared as an elder who knew everything about Gapun’s
history and who spoke flawless and eloquent Tayap. The young man reported
that as a child, he had once been together with Kruni when women from the
neighboring village of Wongan mentioned rainbows, which are called mamor in
their Kopar language. They asked Kruni what the word in Tayap was. Kruni told
them that it was mamar.
Rather than being a breakthrough, this word, too, was rejected. “It means
‘banana’”, all the old people responded dryly when, without telling them why, I
asked them to define mamar. And indeed, it does mean a kind of banana. But in
the end, unable to come up with a word or expression that satisfied them all, and
undoubtedly growing annoyed at my persistence in questioning them, the older
villagers begrudgingly agreed that mamar must be the word for ‘rainbow’ too,
since Kruni apparently had claimed it was.
My own conclusion is that mamar probably was the Tayap word for ‘rainbow’.
Tayap and Kopar share quite a few nouns, because speakers of the two languages
have been in contact with one another for a very long time. The kind of slight
phonetic variation between mamor and mamar are common in the words shared
by the two languages. For example:crocodile
cockatoo
turtle
lorikeet
hookTayap
orem
kaimwa
pawp
njijerɨk
pipiŋgabuKopar
oreo
keimwa
pup
njijerɨŋ
bibigabuFor those all those reasons, I have entered ‘rainbow’ as one of the definitions of
mamar. I recount the little epic of finally getting that word, though, in order to
illustrate the fact that not all of the entries contained in this dictionary will satisfy
all the current speakers of Tayap.","[363, 364, 365]"

Tayap speakers use a number of uninflected words to express emotional states,
affirmation or disagreement, as well as affective involvement with, or phatic
acknowledgement of, other people. These interjections form an utterance by
themselves:
ore‘Yes’. This is a Watam-language borrowing that has all but
replaced Tayap’s awo.awoThe Tayap word for the affirmative ‘Yes’. Since the 1980s,
however, it has become replaced by ore, and the meaning of
awo has shifted to express sarcastic agreement that would be
translated in English as ‘Yeah, right’ or ‘Like I’m so sure’.
The word has also taken on connotations of confrontation and
violence. It is shouted at others whom one is prepared to strike.
Parents use it frequently to threaten disobedient children, and
an adult engaged in a shouting match with another adult might
use it to signal that her or his patience is about to give in. When
it is shouted with sharp, rising volume and strong stress on the
final syllable awó, the word is a warning that means: ‘You haven’t
listened to my warnings and now I’m about to come and hit you!’wákare‘No’. This is also the morpheme of negation, often shortened to
wak when used to mean ‘No’ (as in: ‘Is there any food left?’ ‘No’).
When asked as a sharp question with rising intonation, wákare
signifies a threat, meaning: ‘So you’re not doing what I told you
to do? (I’m therefore going to come and hit you)’.ario‘He/she/it is coming to get you’. This word is used to scare
babies and small children. It is uttered preceded by the name of
the person or thing that the caregiver wants the child to think is
coming to get him or her, and is a vocative call, calling directly
to the person or thing to come and get the baby (in order to hit
the baby, or devour the baby).kapambínana ‘Exactly’, ‘Of course’Interjections and affect words99ŋguméŋgi‘That’s it’, ‘Exactly’yo‘Poor thing’. Always said in a soft voice with rising intonation,

he claims is hers/his.ey‘Oh’, ‘That’s right’. Always said over two beats ‘e-y’ with rise-fall

(1) when shouted, it means: ‘Enough!’, ‘Stop it!’;
(2) when uttered in normal voice and said, for example, in
response to someone saying “Poor thing, I have no food to
give you”, it means: ‘Don’t worry about it’, ‘Don’t bother’.","[117, 118, 119]"
"Orthography452.8 Orthography
The Tayap orthography in this grammar and dictionary uses letters of the English
alphabet that correspond to the language’s phonemes, with two exceptions: ɨ
and ŋ. The phonemes /ɵ/ and /ŋ/ would be difficult to render using the letters
used to write English or Tok Pisin. Tayap is almost never written, and any villager
who does so invents his or her own nonce orthography. In my years of contact with
the villagers, I have received many letters from them, always written in Tok Pisin.
At the very end of these letters, though, after the writer has finished asking me for
money (which is always the sole reason for sending me a letter), he or she often
concludes with a line written in Tayap, to add coercive punch to the requests.
A typical example is the phrase Aowo grag engon yu na na, which occurred at
the very end of a letter that had just instructed me to send the writer the equivalent of $8,000 (at a time when the yearly income for the entire village was about
$500). The interjection aowo is an orthographic rendering of a sound used by
villagers to convey worry and longing, and the rest, ‘good evening to you’, is a
Tayap calque of Tok Pisin’s “gutpela apinun long yu”. The unambiguous meaning
of the Tayap phrase is: ‘I worry about you, so now you worry about me and send
me eight thousand dollars’.
The orthography that villagers have come up with to write Tayap varies from
writer to writer and from occasion to occasion. However, one convention that has
developed over the years regards /ɵ/, which is sometimes written as h, and /ŋ/,
which is often rendered as either nh or ngh. This convention may be the invention
of Amburi Waiki, who was in his late twenties and the village prayer leader in the
mid-1980s. Amburi was the only person in Gapun to write anything in Tayap at
that time, and his orthography – which he himself applied erratically – was seen
by others and perhaps adopted by them. (What Amburi wrote on loose pages and
in school workbooks were the names of villagers who had contributed money to
the village church, and the names of areas of rainforest that he wanted to note
down for various reasons.)
This way of handling Tayap’s phonemes results in a sentence like the following, which Amburi wrote down for me in the 1980s: Ngha nghing ana mbet (‘I have
come for them’).
The problem with the orthography used to write this sentence is that it is
difficult for villagers to parse and read. It makes no distinction between free and
bound morphemes (-ana, ‘for’ or ‘to’, for example, is a bound morpheme that
cannot occur on its own), and literate villagers, who have learned to read by being
drilled in school with texts in English, have difficulty with the sheer number of
letters used to denote simple sounds. (In the orthography used in this grammar
and dictionary the sentence would be written Ŋa ŋgɨnana mbet.)462 Phonology and orthographyA sentence produced in 2009 by a literate villager who I asked to demonstrate
to me how he would write something in Tayap shows that the same problems
have persisted: Nhang nhan patir engon nhayar (‘My house is very nice’). The
orthography is internally inconsistent – the word written engon is pronounced
[εŋgɔn], and thus should be written enhgon, if the conventions of this orthography were followed consistently.
This orthography also quickly gets messy. For example, in the sentence just
quoted, a common word like ŋaŋan (‘my’) is written as two words and spelled
nhang nhan. In other instances, simple pronouns like ŋɨ [ŋɵ] (‘he’) and ŋgɨ [ŋgɵ]
(‘they’) tend to stump village writers, who might write them as nghi and nghgh,
respectively – although they would more likely avoid writing them or give up
trying to write them.
Words with the consonant cluster /ŋg/ also pose difficulties. A name like
‘Saŋgi’ – which the villagers’ orthography should render as something like
Sanhgi – looks strange to the villagers when they see it written out in this way
(they would in this case write ‘Sangi’). Worse, a name like ‘Saŋgiŋgi’, which
might be written something like Sanhginhgi, would make villagers who try to use
their invented orthography throw up their hands in despair.
Because of those difficulties, which villagers perceive and talk about themselves, I do not adopt their orthographic inventions to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/. Instead, I
introduce two additional letters, ɨ and ŋ. These letters are ordered so that ɨ follows
i in the alphabet, and ŋ follows n.
While I depart from the villagers’ attempts to write /ɵ/ and /ŋ/, I do follow
their loose convention of orthographically marking prenasalization on the voiced
word-initial stops /b/ and /d/ and on the affricate /dʒ/. Villagers vary on whether
or not they orthographically mark word-initial nasalization on the velar stop
/g/: a word like ‘cassowary’, spelled ŋgat in this orthography, would probably be
written ngat by most villagers.
On the other hand, though, some of them write ŋgrag ‘evening’ as grag (see
above, the example of a villager’s letter asking me for $8,000). Regardless of how
they would write a word-initial /g/, however, Tayap speakers consistently prenasalize the phoneme when they pronounce it in this position. Hence, I mark this
in the orthography.
This concession to village pronunciation and writing conventions means that
the orthography used here is not as economical as it otherwise might have been.
I could have omitted the nasalization in words beginning with /b/, /d/, /j/ and
/g/ and simply noted that those phonemes are all obligatorily nasalized wordinitially (this is what Christopher Stroud and I did in our 1993 sketch grammar).
In the end, though, I decided that since the only people who might conceivably ever actually use the orthography employed here are the speakers of Tayap,Orthography47their perceptual biases and already-established habits were more important than
an economical orthography. As I just noted, villagers who write anything in Tayap
vary in whether or not they mark the prenasalization before a word-initial /g/. But
they would find it counter-intuitive and odd to see or write bor ‘pig’, je ‘dog’ or der
‘path’ when they say – and would write – mbor, nje and nder.
I therefore write words the way the villagers pronounce them, with the result
that there are no words in the dictionary that begin orthographically with b, d, j
or g.
Word-medial and word-final prenasalized consonants are written as they are
most commonly pronounced, thus the j in munje ‘man’ is written as prenasalized,
as it is normally pronounced, versus mbubujiram ‘bubbles from fish, crocodiles,
turtles emerging from underwater’, which is written unprenasalized.
This orthographic convention would also logically entail changing the spelling of the villagers’ home, Gapun, to Ŋgapun. However, ‘Gapun’ is not a Tayap
word. Senior men in the 1980s told me that they had heard that Germans had
given the name Gapun to their village – which is called Tayap num ‘Tayap village’
in Tayap.
No one knows why ‘Gapun’ was chosen, but the most likely explanation is
that when German cartographers and labor recruiters first appeared in the lower
Sepik area in the early decades of the 1900s, they asked coastal villagers the
names of inland villages which they could not reach, and they wrote down some
version of the names they received in response. The Kopar-language name for
Gapun, for example, is Saŋgap.
No great leap of imagination is required to see how a name like that, through
various mis-hearings and confusions, could end up as Gapun. A significant percentage of the colonial records from the lower Sepik area were destroyed during
WWII, so I have been unable to uncover any information that directly sheds light
on the question of why Gapun is called Gapun.
But whatever the story behind the German naming of the village may be, the
spelling of ‘Gapun’ can remain unchanged, since it is not a Tayap word.
Note that stress is marked where it is a property of a lexical morpheme (for
example, wákare (‘no’), but in the rest of the grammar it is not marked it when it
is a product of complex morpho-phonemics e.g. like kakúndara in (2-14a) above.
Out of respect for villagers’ writing habits (and also to be consistent with the
analysis of the language’s phonology discussed above, where no VVV clusters
are permitted), I have also changed the spelling of the name of the language and
people from Taiap – as I have spelled it in all my previous work on Gapun – to
Tayap.
Whenever villagers write their name for themselves, they always spell it
Tayap. And the word is a popular one to write. The front of one house near the482 Phonology and orthographycenter of the village, for example, is adorned with large letters, painted in black
battery acid, that proclaims (tellingly, in Tok Pisin), NIU LUK TAYAP (‘New Look
Tayap’).
Another young man, upping the linguistic ante in the direction of what many
villagers have understood is the even more prestigious language, used similar
material to paint the words NEW HOME TAYAP on a wall in his house.
A young man with whom I was walking along the beach one day, making
the six-hour trip to the village of Watam to see if the local health worker there
had any medicine for a bad case of scabies I had acquired in the village (she
didn’t), paused at one point to scratch the words NICK OUTCAST PERSON K*B*H*
ROR TAYAP MUNJE into the sand. Translated, this means ‘Nick outcast person
K[ambedagam] B[lue] H[ill] child Tayap man’ – the K*B*H* part of the message
being a name the young villagers have given to their mountain.
Nick’s scribble in the sand doesn’t make much sense in either of the two languages in which it is written. But that is typical of the way that the word Tayap is
used in young villagers’ writing: it is used more as a marker or a tag than as an
attempt to convey referential meaning. Nick’s writing is a slightly more elaborate
variant of the words Tayap ror (Tayap child), which is a popular tag that young
men and women like to carve into trees or add after their signature at the end of
a love letter. The words are modeled on the Tok Pisin word “mangi”, which used
to mean ‘child’, but which during the past thirty years has acquired the sassier
meaning of ‘young person’ or, better, ‘kid’.","[64, 65, 66, 67, 68]"
"1385 Basic verb morphologyIn intransitive verbs, TAM is marked on the verb root and the subject suffix,
when there is one. In certain situations, such as when an intransitive verb is
negated, subject suffixes disappear. Modality is marked by one of the three irrealis suffixes -kɨ, -ki or -ku (see Section 5.2.2).
Subject (S/A)
With the exception of negated verbs, verbs inflected with certain mood endings
(see Section 5.2 and chapter 7) and non-finite forms like participles (Section 4.2)
as well as verbs in certain modification constructions (Section 4.5.1 and 4.5.2),
every verb must be marked for subject (S/A).
Note that in this grammar, the subject suffixes in transitive sentences include
S in their gloss to clearly differentiate them from the object suffixes. The subject
suffixes in intransitive sentences do not include this S, since there is no possibility
of such confusion.
The forms of the subject suffixes are discussed in Section 5.3.2.
Object (O)
Transitivity in verbs is signaled by the presence of an object suffix that either
directly follows the verb stem, or, for certain verbs, that occurs between two discontinuous subject suffixes. Tayap has a number of distinct object suffixes that
signal person, number and TAM. These are discussed in Section 5.3.1.
Generally speaking, verbs are formed by suffixing TAM, object (for transitive
verbs) and subject morphemes onto verb stems. The system is complicated by
the fact that many verbs express TAM partly or wholly through suppletion. This
feature of Tayap grammar is illustrated in example (5-1). In that example, note
how the verb stem alternates between po, when it expresses an action that has
actually occurred, and o, when it expresses an event that has not yet happened.
As was mentioned above, main predicate verb stems never occur independently, and they never occur without being inflected for status (realis/irrealis). Despite this, though, it is easy to identify the root form of a verb. All one
has to know is the verb’s negated form. For this reason, let us examine verbs by
looking at negation first.","[157, 158]"
"5.3 Object (o) and subject (s/a) suffixes
5.3.1 Object suffixes
Before going on to discuss the range of TAM distinctions made in Tayap, it will
be useful to distinguish the various forms of the object and subject suffixes that,
together with the verb stems, encode TAM on a verb.
Taking the object suffixes first, note how their forms in irrealis are simply
the realis forms with an r inserted before the vowel in all cases except 1sg, which
retains the same form in both statuses. Interestingly, only the 3pl is distinguished
from the other non-singular suffixes in both paradigms:

Tayap’s subject (S/A) suffixes can be compared in Tables 5.2 and 5.3 below. Irrealis
subject suffixes only mark gender for singular subjects, and realis subject suffixes
do not mark gender at all. Both paradigms collapse second person non-singular,
they distinguish third person plural, and they collapse first and third person
dual. Note that these complex syncretisms are different in different paradigms
(see Section 3.5 for other pronoun paradigms, including the free pronouns and
benefactive suffixes).

verb root belongs, and many are irregular. These subject markers are discussed

"General overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun5This means that four percent of the world’s population speaks the overwhelming majority of the world’s languages. And those languages – thousands of
them, many of them undocumented – are believed to be in danger of vanishing
within the next one hundred years.
Tayap is one of those languages. And in the literature on language death that
began burgeoning in the 1990s, it has sometimes been featured as a poignant
example. It is discussed, for example, in Daniel Nettle and Suzanne Romaine’s
comprehensive overview of language extinction around the world. Those linguists cite my earlier work on Gapun (employing the spelling of “Tayap” that I
used previously; Kulick 1992) to make the point that:
Taiap is an amazingly rich language in terms of its structural diversity and particularly
distinctive vocabulary, unlike any other in the Sepik. It is not clearly related to any other
language in the area or indeed to any other language in Papua New Guinea as far as we can
tell. (2000:13)This celebration of Tayap’s uniqueness and complexity is a buildup that leads
to a somber punchline: “While further research might provide clues about the
precise genetic relationship between Taiap and other languages, this is unlikely
to happen. Taiap is dying”, write Nettle and Romaine, employing a baleful tone
that is characteristic of work on language death around the world.
No one could dispute that the disappearance of a human language is a cause
for lamentation and mourning. And it would be insensitive and beside the point
to critique linguists’ attempts to inform a wider public about the widespread language extinction that appears to be occurring across the globe today. But even
as we acknowledge and appreciate this, it is still possible to be skeptical of what
has emerged as a dominant way in which linguists discuss language death –
the likening of endangered languages to endangered animals and endangered
plants.
Nettle and Romaine, for example, liken Tayap to a great bird. They write, “if
Taiap were a rare species of bird or Ubykh [another endangered language they
discuss] a dying coral reef, maybe more people would know of their plight and
be concerned”. And they continue, asking dramatically, “Should we be any less
concerned about Taiap than we are about the passing of the California condor?”
(2000: 13–14).
A question like that is difficult to answer, not least because it is far from
obvious what “our” concern that Tayap is dying might actually materialize in practice, and what consequences those material expressions of “our” concern might
have for anyone living in Gapun. There is also a problem with likening Tayap to a
condor because exquisite as languages may be, they really are not like condors or61 The Tayap language and its speakerscoral reefs. Condor chicks are not sent to schools where they are taught in a cosmopolitan language they’ve barely ever heard, and where they learn to devalue
their traditional condor ways. Coral reefs are not converted to Christianity and
told that their traditional reef ways are Satanic.
To be fair, none of these things happen to languages either. But they do
happen to speakers of many of the languages that linguists are so concerned
about. Linguists like Nettle and Romaine who use species metaphors understand this, of course. But in the current cultural climate that exhorts people
to develop concern for the environment and sustainability, many linguists
seem to believe that they can elicit some kind of sympathy and support for
dying languages if they talk about them in terms of biodiversity and species
loss.
This way of thinking about language death is specious, however, because
it directs our attention to the natural world. By encouraging us to think in
terms of ecosystems rather than political systems, ecological or species metaphors elide, or at least defer, the simple realization that language death is
anything but a natural phenomenon. On the contrary, it is a profoundly social
phenomenon.
Languages die because people stop speaking them, not because they exhaust
themselves in the fullness of time or are killed off by predatory languages of
greater phonological scope or syntactic richness.
A better metaphor for language death, instead of seeing languages as
animals or organisms, would be to think of them like political movements,
philosophies or religions – that is, to consider them as social phenomena that
cannot be comprehended apart from history, beliefs, economics, desire, structure and power. And that necessarily change and sometimes even disappear as
the material, economic, social and cultural conditions that sustain them shift
and transform.
With that in mind, and given the current state and tenor of Gapun village life,
I wish to make it clear that this grammar and dictionary of Tayap is not an effort to
influence the future. It is, instead, a record that documents what I am convinced
soon will be the irrevocable past. Gapun villagers are ceasing to speak their language and if present trends persist, in thirty or forty years, Tayap will be gone
forever. While this is inconsolably sad, it is the villagers’ choice. It is a choice I
have no doubt that their descendants will castigate them for, as always eventually
happens with languages that die.
But I do not write this grammar and dictionary with the fantasy that its
appearance will somehow change villagers’ lives and make them revive their
dying language. Indeed, I recognize that the opposite may – and at this point
probably will – happen. The appearance of Tayap words printed in a book mayGeneral overview of Tayap and the linguistic situation in Gapun7foster resignation and complacency: a sense that, “Well now our language is all
there in a book, so we don’t really have to worry about it anymore, our children
can learn it from the book when they’re grown up”. Tayap in a book may also
solidify a view that the language is an august tongue of the ancestors far too
majestic and esoteric for young people to ever even attempt to master.
So why write a book about Tayap? Partly to preserve some small part of the
proverbial treasure chest of human knowledge, certainly. But mostly, I have
written this grammar and dictionary primarily in the hope that a curious young
Gapuner, sometime in the probably distant future, will discover it somewhere and
value the fact that the obsolete language of his or her ancestors did not disappear
without a trace.
The dictionary that accompanies this grammar is trilingual: Tayap, English
and Tok Pisin. A few of the villagers in Gapun have had as many as ten years of
schooling, most of it in English. Despite that, though (or, really, because of that),
none of them currently possesses anything but the most rudimentary command of
that language.1 No villager today will be able to make much sense of this grammar
of Tayap, but the dictionary part of this work may be entertaining and useful to
them now, as opposed to some distant future. And to facilitate that usefulness, I
have included definitions in the language that is replacing Tayap and in which all
villagers are fluent: Tok Pisin.
I have also provided many examples of how the words in the dictionary
are used in Tayap, and I have purposely included a large number of vulgarities.
Gapun villagers are no different from anyone else who has ever scoured a dictionary to see if it dared to list the most obscene terms that one and one’s sniggering
friends could dream up. I hope that the shock of seeing some of their most vulgar
words and insults immortalized in a book will provide the villagers with a great
deal of guilty pleasure.
This grammar and dictionary should be of interest to linguists who study
Sepik and Ramu languages and the genealogical relationships of Papuan languages more generally. It should also interest archeologists and historians who
study the peopling and linguistic diversity of the Sepik region of Papua New
Guinea.","[24, 25, 26, 27]"
"3.6 Quantifiers
3.6.1 Counting
The traditional counting system in Tayap was based on a person’s fingers and
toes. This is a well-known areal feature (Laycock 1975). The Tayap system allowed
counting up to twenty, although in principle the system could count indefinitely,
because after reaching twenty, one could, I was told, begin counting again on the
body of another person (so ‘twenty-one’ could be ‘two hands and two legs and
one hand one finger on the other side’).
This laborious system, for which there seems to have been no shorthand, disappeared rapidly after villagers began speaking Tok Pisin among themselves in
the 1930s and 1940s. Today it is only vaguely remembered, and is regarded as an
amusing, cumbersome and primitive curiosity by everyone in Gapun.
Villagers still use the Tayap words for ‘one’ through to ‘five’, and they sometimes combine them to denote a number between five and ten. For example, I
once overheard a villager ask another in Tayap how many bags a cocoa buyer who
had come to Gapun had filled (this was a typical instance of using Tayap to “hide
talk” from non-villagers). The addressee, a thirty-year-old man who is a very weak
speaker of Tayap and who under other circumstances never speaks it, responded
by saying manaw towotowo (literally ‘three four’), which in this context meant
seven bags.
Villagers also sometimes use the Tayap word for ‘ten’, but never any of the
others, which are always said in Tok Pisin.
The traditional system, as I recorded it from senior men in the 1980s, is as
follows:
nambar

‘two’
‘three’883 Word classestowotowo

modifiers can occur in any order; see Section 4.1.1). So:3

There are no ordinal numerals in Tayap, and to express what English expresses as
adverbial numerals (‘twice’, ‘thrice’, ‘four times’, etc.), Tayap uses a construction in3 senea is sene (‘two’) with the conjunction -a; so ‘two-and’Quantifiers89which the number is the main verb and the event that happens a number of times is
nominalized by suffixing the irrealis verb stem with the non-finite suffix -(ŋ)gar (see
Section 4.2). This nominalized event serves as the subject of the number-as-verb.
Examples are:

As was discussed in Section 3.1.1.3, the only nouns in Tayap with non-singular
forms are the closed class of nouns denoting some humans, and pigs and dogs. All
other nouns have only one form. To indicate plurality in those nouns, the following
quantifiers may be used. They immediately follow the noun to which they refer:
sambgeneral marker of plurality, most often used with countable
nouns
non samb used with unquantifiable masses like water or food
sami
‘many’, ‘lots of’, ‘plenty’
-ŋgro

"8.2.1 Non-final verbs in serial verb constructions
Intransitive verbs used as non-final verbs take their irrealis stem (while not taking
an irrealis suffix -kɨ, -ki or -ku), and do not take any further marking. In the next
example, the non-final verb rar ‘see’ appears in its irrealis stem form, with no further
marking, and is immediately followed by the final verb of the serial verb construction. Note that in this example, together these two verbs form a complex predicate,
which is then marked with a conjunction ‘and’, forming a coordinated clause (see
Section 9.3):
(8-4) rarmboka tankun
rar
mbok
-a
see.irr go.1sg.f|1pl.r -and2328 Complex predicatesta
-n -ku
-n
see.r -s <3sg.f.r.o> -sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
‘… I was looking and I saw it ...’ (lit. ‘seeing go and seeing it…’)
On transitive verbs used as non-final verbs, again the irrealis stem is used, and
the object is marked using a realis form, regardless of the status marking on the
final verb to follow. For example (non-final verb in bold):
(8-5)manŋa ŋgwab nambar krarkuotike
man =ŋa
ŋgwab nambar krar
-ku
otike
cunt =poss hole
one
break.irr -3sg.f.r.o
fall.dl.r
‘the two of them broke open the same cunt hole and fell out’ (i.e. they are
brothers)Note that these non-final verbs are not truncated forms of full verbs. Compare the
form of the class 4 transitive verb ‘break’, in bold print in the following example
(this is a coordinated construction, see Section 9.3) with its non-final form above
in example (8-5):
(8-6) manŋa ŋgwab nambar kratukureya otike
man =ŋa
ŋgwab nambar
cunt =poss hole
one
kra
-tu -ku
-re
-ya
otike
break.r -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -dl.r.s -and fall.dl.r
‘the two of them broke open the same cunt hole and fell out’
Examples (8-5) and (8-6) have more or less the same meaning. But notice that the
only element that is the same in both verbs is the realis object suffix -ku. The stem
of the fully inflected verb (8-6) kra ‘break’ has a TAM-appropriate stem (in this
case, since it is expressing an event that occurred in the past, the stem appears
in its realis form).
The non-final forms in serial verb constructions (8-5) will always appear in irrealis form, and TAM will be carried by the verb that follows it. The final verb has the
full range of possibilities of any normal verb outside of serial verb constructions.
8.2.2 Non-final object morphemes (nfo)
The object suffixes that can affix to non-final verbs have two forms: they are either
the regular forms that occur on independent transitive verbs (see Section 5.3.1), orSerial verb constructions (svc)233they are drawn from a particular set of object forms that only occur on non-final
verbs. This set of non-final object suffixes is as follows; note that there is no distinction between dual and plural forms in this paradigm:
singulardual/plural-ai-am2-aw-am3sg.f
3sg.m-ak
-at-amb1Example:
(8-7) tandiwkɨ rarambotɨmbɨn
tandiw -kɨ
rar
-amb
o
-tɨ -mbɨ
-n
well
-emph look.irr -3pl.nfo shoot.sbj -s <3pl.r.o> -2sg3sg.f.r.s
‘aim well and shoot them!’
These non-final object morphemes are the functional equivalent of the object
suffixes used with the final verbs of serial verb constructions or indeed any verb
outside of serial verb constructions. They are also more or less interchangeable
with them. Looking again at example (8-7), above, it is possible to substitute
-amb (3pl.nfo) with -mbɨ (3pl.r.o), the regular object suffix used in independent verbs:
(8-8) tandiwkɨ rarmbɨotɨmbɨn
tandiw -kɨ
rar
-mbɨ
o
-tɨ- -mbɨ
-n!
well
-emph look.irr -3pl.r.o shoot.sbj -s- <3pl.r.o> -2sg|3sg.f.r. s
‘aim well and shoot them!’
It is not possible, however, to substitute -mbɨ with -amb in other clauses. There
are two main differences between the non-final and other forms of the object morphemes:
(1) Whenever one occurs, a non-final verb object suffix always occurs in the
first object position of a complex predicate. Another non-final object can
occur in the second or subsequent object slot, but a non-final object suffix
is blocked from appearing after an independent object morpheme has
occurred.
(2) Non-final object morphemes do not inflect for realis and irrealis. Unlike the
forms used with independent verbs – where -ku, for example, expresses
3sg.f.r.o and -kru expresses 3sg.f.irr.o – the non-final object forms always2348 Complex predicatesoccur in the forms listed above. Like the verbs to which they affix, which are
unaffixed for realis/irrealis status, the non-final object suffixes are unmarked
with regard to status.
It is not always clear how to determine which object morpheme – the non-final
verb object morpheme or the other form – will be used in any given instance.
So in tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana (repeated from (8-1)) notice that the non-final
object -at 3sg.m.nfo occurs after the first verb, and the form that occurs with
other verbs, -ŋgɨ 3sg.m.r.o occurs after the second non-final verb:
(8-9) tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana
tapr
carry_on_shoulders.irr-at
kɨ
-ŋgɨ
-3sg.m.nfo bring -3sg.m.r.oatɨ
-kɨ
tak
-ana
go_down.irr -irr 3sg.f.r -intent
‘she will carry him down on her shoulders’
The subject of a complex predicate like tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana is encoded on the
inflected final verb, and it is this final verb that would be negated to negate the
predicate. To see this clearly, below are examples of this same complex predicate
inflected for different subjects. Note the differences in the subject suffix (in bold)
just prior to the final intentional suffix – everything else in the verb remains the
same. Example (8-10d), repeated from (8-2), gives the negated verb, where, as
always, there is no subject marked.
(8-10) a. tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨ -net

‘they will carry him down on their shoulders’
d. tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨ wákare

‘(any subject) won’t (or didn’t) carry him down on her shoulders’Serial verb constructions (svc)2358.2.3 Verbs that always or usually occur only in svcs
8.2.3.1 svcs with the grammaticalized verb kv ‘bring’, ‘take’
The verb stem kv only ever occurs as a non-final verb within a svc. It expresses
that an object will be brought to the deictic center or taken away from the deictic
center in a way that is specified by the verb of motion that follows it.
Tayap has a number of verbs that express different ways of carrying objects.
They include:
andruwe ‘carry on head’
erorar ‘carry on back’
ser-(p)-e ‘carry in hand’
tap ‘carry on shoulders’
wuw ‘carry on one shoulder’
Verbs like these express specific ways of carrying an object. The verb stem kv, on
the other hand, does not specify how an object is carried. It simply means ‘bring’
or ‘take’ in both the narrow sense of physically carrying something, and in the
more extended sense of, for instance, ‘bringing the visitors down (or taking them
down) to the end of the village to send them off’. Tayap speakers use the Tok Pisin
word “kisim” as a more or less exact equivalent.
Unlike all other verbs in the language, kv never functions as a final verb of a
serial verb construction, nor indeed any other verb type:
– it never occurs without another verb following it in a serial verb construction;
– it is not marked for tense;
– it does not take subject morphemes (although it does take object marking);
– and it cannot be independently negated.
Whenever it is used, kv must occur as part of a serial verb construction, in construction with other non-final verbs and/or fully inflected final verbs.
Kv ‘bring’ is one of the most commonly occurring verbs in Tayap, since
villagers are constantly telling children and others to bring them things (kv +
object morpheme + aiki ‘come’) or take things away (kv + object morpheme +
okɨ ‘go’).
Examples of its use are as follows (kv in bold):
(8-11)kv ‘bring’, ‘take’
a. ŋaŋan sapwar kukuwe!
ŋaŋan
sapwar ku
-ku
1sg.poss basket bring -3sg.f.r.o

sapwar ku
-ku
ŋgwok
-ara
1sg.poss basket take -3sg.f.r.o
go.3pl.r -perf
‘they took my basket’ (lit. ‘they left taking my basket’)
As the only obligatorily non-final verb in the language, it is likely that kv has been
grammaticalized from an earlier independent verb stem. Note that according
to Haspelmath (1995), constructions like those described here for Tayap with kv
should not be considered svcs since kv is not an independent verb. However, while
kv is indeed not an independent verb, it is useful to consider it with other verbs
functioning in svcs. It takes object marking like a normal verb; it also has verbal
semantics. Further, kv can form part of longer sequences of verbs in a complex
predicate, like in example (8-1) in which kv is the second of three predicates functioning together as a complex whole: here it is functionally identical to the other
non-final verb of the svc, clearly acting equivalently to other verbs in the language.
Alternatively, the morpheme kv could be thought of as a converb, or an auxiliary. However with a converb one would expect a situation of adverbial subordination (Haspelmath 2005: 3), and with an auxiliary one would expect tense,
aspectual, modal, voice or polarity semantics (Schachter and Shopen 2007: 41),
all of which are lacking here.
Kv could also be thought of as an incorporated adverb. The best analysis,
however, would seem to be to regard kv as a grammaticalized non-final verb.
8.2.3.2 Verbs which normally occur in svcs
With the exception of the grammaticalized verb kv (‘bring’, ‘take’), just discussed,
all Tayap verbs can be used independently, outside of serial verb constructions.
A number of verbs associated with motion, however, almost always appear as
non-final verbs in serial verb constructions.
The most commonly occurring verbs of this type are the following (all verbs
in the svc are in bold):
(8-12)ru ‘propel’, ‘expel’

ŋgotɨtek ‘fell.3pl.r’). One reason may be that the speaker, who was shouting angrily in affect,
produced an ungrammatical utterance. Another reason may be that the verb ‘fall’, when it is
used as part of a svc, as it is here, has become a formulaic expression, and is realized as otɨtek
for all subjects, regardless of gender or number. In example (8-13), the plural meaning of the verb
is conveyed by the nfo (-amb). Compare examples (8-12a) and (8-22).","[251, 252, 253, 254, 255, 256, 257]"
"Tayap has a six-way distinction for singular referents – three for feminine referents and three for masculine referents. As in other parts of Tayap grammar,
the gender distinction collapses in the plural, and here the language maintains a

plural is highly unusual and may in fact be a simplification: the middle term in
the singular could in fact be a close-to-addressee term or expressing other pragmatic factors (see e.g. Wilkins 1999).5
In addition to the words listed above, Tayap also has a number of slightly
different deictic words. They are as follows:
FeminineMasculinePluralaŋgok…aŋgo

protagonist responded to the other’s threats to come and beat him up with the
dismissive snort addressed to everybody who was listening:6

These topicalizing deictic words often co-occur, sometimes multiple times in an
utterance.7 They can be post-posed to a noun to emphasize it, for example in

reallyThe -ítŋo suffix that I recorded in the 1980s no longer occurs in the speech of
anyone in Gapun.
Today, to the very limited extent that the idea of repeated actions over an
extended period is encoded by a verbal suffix at all, this is done by adding the
suffix -ŋo, or its variants -eŋo, -erŋo and -irŋo directly to the irrealis stem of an
intransitive verb. The suffix is the same for all subjects; a verb with this suffix
takes no subject endings, and the verb is always repeated.

Reflexive and reciprocal constructions are formed by adding the suffix -ano
(-ŋano after a vowel) to the subject pronoun.
In reflexive constructions, the valency of a verb is decreased, so a verb that
normally takes two arguments – a subject and object – instead only takes one.
There is no explicit grammatical marking of this decreasing valency other than in
the fact that a verb in a reflexive construction is always intransitive.

awin nanuk =nɨ
ŋa -ŋano ta

=loc 1sg -refl see.r -1sg.m|3sg.m.r
‘I saw myself in the mirror’
Non singular subjects in this construction convey reciprocity:

‘the two of us saw ourselves’ or ‘saw each other’
c. ŋgɨŋano amurukuke
ŋgɨ -ŋano amuru -kuke
3pl -refl fight.r -dl.r
‘the two of them are fighting each other’
This construction can also be used for emphasis, to convey that the subject does
the action alone:

Perhaps the single most complex feature of Tayap’s grammar is the formation
of verbs in the realis status. The realis stem forms are only used in forming the
non-future tense and the perfect aspect. However, because the realis status is
what speakers use to refer to actions and events that have occurred in the past
or are occurring in the present – as well as to make gnomic statements like ‘birds
fly’ – it is the single most frequently occurring inflectional form in the speech of
fluent Tayap speakers.
In the speech of younger, less fluent speakers, the non-future tense is still
used, but the weakest speakers do their best to get around it as much as they can.
To manage this, they overextend the progressive aspect, which is easier to inflect,
partly because the verb stem inflects in its irrealis form and thus remains consistent, and partly because the suffixes that encode person and number that follow
the verb stem have minimal variation (see Section 5.3).
The realis status is another kettle of fish. Its inflectional forms are irregular
both in terms of the kinds of changes that occur in verb stems, and also in terms
of their relative predictability. Transitive and intransitive verbs have very different
inflectional patterns.
The following section (Section 6.1) discusses transitive verbs; intransitive
verbs are discussed separately in Section 6.2.","[181, 182, 183]"
"Perception constructions273One argument, the subject or the object of the main clause, is coreferent with
either the subject or object of the nominalized clause. The verb of the nominalized clause is fully inflected. These clauses, while marked with the possessive
clitic (as relative clauses are), are structurally different from relative clauses.
Relative clauses modify NPs, and they occur in the modifier slot within an NP.
These nominalized clauses, on the contrary, while they share an argument with
their main clause, do not modify an NP but rather modify an entire main clause,
within the specific semantic domain of perception. The shared argument of the
clauses is expressed only once, in the main clause, while the nominalized clause
consists only of the nominalized predicate and any arguments.
These are not complement clauses either, as the nominalized clause does not
function as an argument of the main clause, but rather as a modifier. This can
clearly be seen for example in (9-32b), in which it can’t be the case that the nominalized clause is functioning as an argument of the main clause. The main clause
verb has 3pl object marking, so the object must be the women, not the clause
describing them going into the forest.
Other potential candidates for complement clauses, including constructions
of saying and telling, are expressed with verbal morphology involving indirect
commands (see Section 7.1.4).

structure as a whole is ‘Sopak saw Nik [spearing the pig]’. The clause is not modifying Nik, as it would be in a relative clause, but rather the perception clause
predicates what is perceived.","[292, 293]"

A relative clause is a clause which modifies a noun phrase, which “delimits the
reference of an NP by specifying the role of the referent of that NP in the situation
described by the [relative clause]” (Andrews 2007: 206). Relative clauses in Tayap
are nominalized, marked with the inanimate possessive clitic =ŋa(n) which
appears on the verb of the relative clause. This possessive clitic =ŋa(n) is added
to a fully inflected verb, which then functions as a subordinate relative clause.
The common argument or head (“domain nominal” in Andrews’ 2007 terms) of
a relative and a main clause can be in S, A, O or oblique function in the relative
clause and in the main clause.
Tayap relative clauses are external. The relative clause generally directly
follows the common argument in the main clause. This is the position held by a
nominal modifier (e.g. adjective) as well (see Chapter 4).
The common argument may also be expressed with a deictic (Section 3.8)
functioning resumptively with respect to the head noun, and typically following
the common argument directly: for example, consider (9-29a-b). In both examples
there are two resumptive pronouns, in (9-29a) following the relative clause and as
the final part of the main clause and in (9-29b) following the common argument
and as the final part of the main clause. Note that these resumptive pronouns agree
in gender and number with the common argument. They are not an obligatory part
of relative clauses: see for example (9-29c) and (9-29f), which do not have them.
Note that the verb of the relative clause is fully inflected, and the relative
clause contains all the usual components of a clause. The relative clause mayRelative clauses269even contain a complex predicate: see for example (9-29f) which has a relative
clause with a serial verb construction involving kv ‘bring’ in construction with a
verb (see Section 8.2.3.1).
Relative clauses would appear to always be restrictive. No non-restrictive relative clauses have been found in the data. In the following example the possessive marker is in bold and the head noun in the main clause underlined.

Relative clauses are not very common and the corpus contains few examples to
show whether the common argument is syntactically a part of the relative clause
or part of the main clause. However the main clause of (9-29d) can be negated
using wákare before munje (and changing the verb kiraw to kirawŋgrɨ). This suggests that munje belongs syntactically in the relative clause rather than the main
clause. However more examples are needed to be certain.
Tayap used to have another relativizing suffix: the morpheme -gin (or perhaps
it was a clitic =gin, there is not enough evidence to show). This morpheme seems
to be synonymous with, and occurs in exactly the same morphological slot as,
=ŋa(n). For example:
(9-30) patɨr aŋgu ŋaŋan omoŋi perkungin otɨtekara
patɨr aŋgu ŋaŋan

-gin otɨtek-ara
-sg|1pl.r.s -rel fall.3sg.f.r-perf
‘the house there that my father built has collapsed’
The morpheme appears both in naturally occurring talk and in elicitation sessions that I recorded in the 1980s. By 2009, however, it was no longer used by
anybody. 49.6 Finite nominalizations with consequence clitic =ŋa(n)
Finite nominalizations are constructed, like relative clauses, with the possessive
clitic, and carry the meaning of consequence; that a particular state has been
brought into existence because of an action. For example:
(9-31)kokɨr mbɨdtia ŋaŋan noŋor kokɨr kratianŋa

‘my head hurts because my wife hit me on the head’9.7 Perception constructions
Sentences that describe an act of perceiving, like seeing or smelling, can be
expressed in two ways in Tayap: either paratactically as two separate clauses, or
with a nominalized construction.
In the perception construction, the perceiver is subject of the main clause,
and the person or thing perceived is object. In the subordinate (nominalized)
clause, always placed after the main clause, the action expressing the circumstances of the perception is indicated. Coreferential with the main clause object
is the thing perceived, which may be subject or object in the subordinate clause.
The two possibilities are exemplified below:4 This is a reduced form of mbɨd-t-iata-n (pain.R-S<1SG.BEN.O.R>2SG|3SG.F.R.S). See the note
that directly follows example (7-29) in Chapter 7.","[287, 288, 289, 290, 291]"
"8.2.4 Switch-function serial verb constructions
Switch-function serial verb constructions (the term is from Aikhenvald 2006), in
which the object of the non-final verb is shared with the subject of the final verb
are common in Tayap.
Examples are:
(8-19)ŋayi awin worerkuwok
ŋa =yi
awin worer
-ku
wok
1sg =erg.f water capsize.irr -3sg.f.r.o

yesterday 3sg.m =erg.m medicine (TP) swallow.irr -3sg.f.r.o
wok
go.3sg.f.r
‘Yesterday he swallowed the medicine’ (lit. He swallowed the medicine,
it went)So these are constructions in which the subject marking on the final verb agrees
with the object of the preceding transitive verb (in other words: in example (8-21)
it agrees with the -ku ‘3sg.f.r.o’ of the first part of the svc); both refer to the ‘medicine’, the object of ‘swallow’ and the subject of ‘go’. Other examples of these types
of constructions are (8-12a), (8-14) and (8-15) above.3
These constructions occasion confusion in speakers (even older, fluent
speakers) when they are brought to their attention. When I asked speakers
whether an example like (8-21) ought not to be mɨtɨ-ku-mbot (that is, with a final
verb that agrees with the masculine subject of the previous verb, so go.3sg.m.r),
they would pause, consider and agree. But then they would produce sentences
like (8-21), where the final verb agrees with the object of the previous verb and
not its subject. Occasionally during elicitation sessions, they would become
flustered and contradict themselves when producing gender agreement. An
example is:
(8-22)ŋayi munje inde awinnɨ rɨŋgotɨtek
ŋa =yi
munje inde awin =nɨ
1sg =erg.f man
dx
water =loc
rɨ
-ŋgɨ
otɨtek
propel.irr -3.sg.m.r.o
fall.3sg.f.r
‘I (m or f) threw the man in the water’In this example the man, masculine, is marked as such in the object affix on the
verb ‘propel’. But the same argument is marked as feminine in the subject of the
second verb ‘fall’.","[259, 260]"
"Serial verb constructions (svc)231is permeable, and can be interrupted by question morphemes and even separate
words, as in the following:
(8-3) kopi tarak masinnɨ ŋgakrawokwankuk
kopi
tar
-ak
masin=nɨ
coffee (TP) take.irr -3sg.f.nfo machine (TP)=loc
ŋgakrawo -kwan
kuk
shell.irr -3sg.f.ben.r.o be.sg.f|1pl.r
‘we used to take the coffee to a machine and shell it’
In this situation the form is no longer a single phonological word but still a single
predicate.
Serial verb constructions are composed of one or more non-final verb(s) and
a final verb. The non-final verbs are always formally irrealis, but the final verb can
take the full range of Tayap’s TAM inflections. TAM and subject marking occurs
once across the construction, on the final verb, and the non-final verb(s) are
marked only for their object, if transitive.
According to Haspelmath (2016: 296), a serial verb construction is “a monoclausal construction consisting of multiple independent verbs with no element
linking them and with no predicate-argument relation between the verbs”. It is
important to make clear that non-final and final verbs are both independent, and
there is not a relationship of syntactic dependency between the verbs of a serial
verb construction. Instead, there is a sharing of features (TAM, subject marking
and negation). The differences between non-final and final verbs are positional, a
factor of where they fall in the clause, rather than related to dependency.","[250, 251]"

Immediately after they finished telling their story in Tayap, I always asked young
speakers to re-tell the story in Tok Pisin. I did this for two reasons. First, I did
it in order to compare the fluency and complexity of the narratives – in order324Tayap Textsto check, for example, whether a speaker told a brief, simple narrative in Tayap
because she or he was someone whose narrative style was brief and simple in any
language, or whether a brief and simple story in Tayap was an artefact of limited
active competence in the language.
The second reason I elicited the same story in Tok Pisin was to be able to
make educated guesses about what a speaker had attempted to say in Tayap in
those instances where the forms she or he used were far from the grammatically
correct ones.
Here is the story this speaker told immediately after he concluded his Tayap
narrative:

butchered it, then we came back again to the village.","[343, 344]"
"101 The Tayap language and its speakersthe list he provides in his published article on how he classified them (Laycock
1973: 70–71).
For example, in his Bungain fieldnotes, a word Laycock does translate, as
‘snake’ (atop’), is numbered 172. But in the published list, ‘snake’ is word number
152. Eight untranslated words follow atop’, but the ninth, kwulémbe, Laycock
translates as ‘mosquito’. The problem is that in the word list published in his
article, ‘mosquito’ comes eleven words after ‘snake’. These kinds of discrepancies
make it impossible to use the word list Laycock provided in his article to identify
the untranslated vernacular words he noted down in his field notebooks. This is
not a problem with Laycock’s Tayap material, because I know the meaning of all
the words he noted down. But since I know no Bungain, much of his list for that
language is unrevealing.
As far as I am able to tell, there are no lexical similarities between Bungain
and Tayap, beyond a couple of words that are common throughout the Sepik,
such as the word for water (Bungain: wi; Tayap awin). Grammatically and morphologically, I could discern no similarities between Tayap and Bungain, and
after examining the fieldnotes I was at a loss to understand the basis for his statement that “their relationship with each other is clear but not close” (Laycock and
Z’graggen 1975: 757).
My own suspicion is that Laycock couldn’t easily fit either Tayap or Bungain
into the language families he had developed for the Sepik region, and so he
simply guessed that they might be related to one another. Later researchers
have suggested that Bungain may be a Torricelli phylum language (Sanders and
Sanders 1980: 188). Foley (2018) classes Bungain as a member of the Marienberg
Hills family, a subgroup of the Torricelli family. He bases the classification of
Bungain on morphological criteria gleaned from his own fieldwork data, which
he describes as “brief” (Foley 2018: 304). He provides some of this data, including a pronoun paradigm, subject agreement prefixes, morphological description
and some sentence material in his major descriptive work on the Sepik-Ramu
languages (2018: 197–431). None of this material is suggestive of a relationship
between Bungain and Tayap.
To illustrate how different Tayap is from neighboring languages, I have
added it to the “Lower Sepik family basic word list” that appears in William
Foley’s 1986 book, The Papuan languages of New Guinea. To enable the table to
appear on a single page, I have omitted one of the languages in the original table
(Karawari). The (K) after words in the Murik column indicates forms in the Kopar
language.","[29, 30]"

Examples of other class 2 verbs are:
utɨr-(p/w)-or ‘cut into small pieces’, ‘slice up’
war
‘bury’; ‘put inside e.g. a basket’; ‘scrape or grate, e.g. coconut’
wi-(p/w)-o ‘put on top of something’
woi
‘roll up’
wur
‘dislodge’; ‘strain sago’; ‘braid a grass skirt’; ‘catch something
by hooking it’
wuw
‘dig a hole’
Just because a verb begins with a semivowel in its root form does not mean that
it is a class 2 verb. The following verbs, for example, all begin with w, but are not
class 2 verbs:
wawar-(p)-e ‘hang up’, e.g. on a hook (class 1)
wemb-(p)-er ‘chase’ (class 1)
wure
‘worry about’; ‘be concerned about’ (class 5)
For that reason, the entries in the dictionary make it clear (a) which verbs are
class 2 verbs and (b) where in the verb the p/w alternation occurs. The verbs are
entered in their root form, so a verb like ‘sweep’ (p/w)-oi is entered as woi (again,
because the negated form of the verb is woi + irrealis object). The designation
as a ‘class 2’ verb means that it displays p/w alternation.
If the alternation is word initial, this isn’t marked. If it is word internal, this is
shown, as it is in the above examples in parenthesis (see utɨr-(p/w)-or and wi-(p/
w)-o above as examples).
6.1.3 Class 1 and 2 verbs in young people’s Tayap
All verbs that have different stems in their irrealis and realis forms pose problems
for young speakers of Tayap. What generally happens whenever young speakers
are unsure of a form is that they take the irrealis stem (which is the same as the
verb root) and inflect that stem with realis morphology – that is, with object and
subject morphemes marked for realis status.","[192, 193]"
"2.4 Vowel harmony
Vowel harmony and regressive assimilation are characteristic features of Tayap
verbs. The vowel of the object morpheme often influences the vowel of the verb
stem or subject morpheme that precedes it.
Compare, for example, the following two forms of the verb ‘set down’:(2-5) a. ŋa=yi
ŋgu ŋgun
-nu -ku
-n
1sg=erg.f 3sg.f set_down.r -s

-nɨ -ŋgɨ
-n
1sg=erg.f 3sg.m set_down.r -s <3sg.m.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.s
‘I set him down’
The same process is evident in the subject markers of the following verb, ‘collect’:(2-6) a. ŋgu=yi
korat
-tu
3sg.f=erg collect.r -s
‘she collected it’b. ŋgu=yi
korat
3sg.f=erg collect.r

-s-ku
<3sg.f.r. o>-mbɨ
<3pl.r.o>-n
-2sg|3sg.f.r.s-n
-2sg|3sg.f.r.sNote how the vowel immediately preceding the object suffix changes according
to whether the object suffix contains a mid vowel or a back vowel. That it is the
vowel in the object suffix that influences the vowel in the verb stem, and not vice
versa, is clear from the fact that object suffixes are invariant – they are the same
for all verb stems (see Sections 3.5, 5.3.1 and 5.3.2).
In (2-6a) and (2-6b), the morpheme preceding the object is the first part of
a discontinuous subject morpheme. The vowel in that morpheme, which will
always be /u/ or /ɵ/, is often either reduced to a schwa or is omitted altogether,
especially if it occurs after /n/ or medially between /k/ and /ɾ/. For example:
(2-7) a. ŋɨŋi koranukun (pronounced korankun)
ŋɨ=ŋi
kora
-nu -ku
-n
3sg.m=erg collect.r -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.s
‘he collected it’
b. ninukun (pronounced ninkun)
ni
-nu -ku
-n
do.r -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.s
‘I (m or f) did it’, ‘he did it’, ‘she did it’, ‘we did it’Stress37The orthography used in this grammar and dictionary reflects the vowel deletion.
Note that in those cases when the vowel was not pronounced, it is not written in
the word.
The only other phonotactic rule involving vowels is that following the bilabial nasal /m/ or a velar stop, a vowel can acquire the semivowel /w/, a case of
progressive rounding, as described for Sougb by Reesink (2002a); e.g.:
→ sumwan
(2-8) a. suman ‘big’
b. Mukar (male name) → mukwaɾ
→ aŋgwaɾ
c. a-ŋgar
be.irr-nfn.sg
‘being’2.5 Stress
Stressed syllables are realized as louder and longer than unstressed syllables.
Stress in Tayap is generally not phonemic, and unpredictable stress occurs rarely.
In the dictionary, unpredictable stress occurs on roughly two percent of words.
Stress usually falls on the final syllable of an uninflected word (but see below
for more information about stress on bound morphemes):
(2-9) ambagái ‘men’s house’
karép ‘moon’
kemém ‘long’
koŋgód ‘hour glass drum’
orímb ‘audible fart’
otár ‘fire’
makatók ‘green coconut’
minjiké ‘betel nut’ndugubár ‘backbone’
ŋayár ‘really’
piŋín ‘clitoris’
pokémb ‘cold’
puwás ‘white’
toŋgodíp ‘Malay apple’
tumbúr ‘shoulder’
wekók ‘obscenity’There are a number of non-predictable exceptions to the syllable-final rule. The
orthography used in this grammar and dictionary marks stress explicitly on those
exceptional words. Examples of two-syllable words with non-final stress:
mbímaŋ ‘leech’
símbu ‘maggot’
Examples of longer words with non-final stress:382 Phonology and orthography(2-10) arúmbatak ‘fly’
atáwo ‘older sibling’
mbíoŋgi ‘baby’
emári ‘ancestral spirit’pasákeke ‘frog’
ndagúnɨ ‘furtively’
supwáspwa ‘badly’
tandímɨrit ‘broom for swatting
mosquitoes’
kanjígogo ‘edible bamboo shoot’ uráŋgeba ‘large bullfrog’
nekénduko ‘sharp grass’
wákare ‘no’Syllables with unpredictable stress are far more common with the vowel a than
the other vowels. In the dictionary more than three times as many instances occur
with a as with any other vowel.
In general, stress is a property of a lexical morpheme, not an inflected word,
and thus stress placement is retained under affixation. For example:
munjé ‘man’ munjénum ‘men’
mɨrí ‘forest’ mɨrínɨ ‘in the forest’
There are some minimal pairs differentiated only by stress:

nok átukun! ‘pee!’ (lit.

Section 5.5):

towótowó ‘four’

Inflected verbs take stress on the final syllable of the word as a whole, with
various exceptions, which are conditioned by the conjugation class of the verb,
as well as by TAM and other types of affixation.
Other instances of unusual stress include the following:
(1) In verbs inflected in the perfect aspect and the intentional mood, stress falls
on the syllable that precedes the perfect suffix (-(da)ra) and the intentional suffix
(-(n)ana):

2sg sago jelly consume.irr -3sg.f.irr.o -intent =q
‘Would you eat sago jelly?’ (if I offer you some)
(2) In verbs inflected in the counterfactual, stress falls on -rɨk, the counterfactual
suffix:
(2-15) akrᵼḱ nukun
ak
-rᵼḱ -nu -ku
-n
eat.cf -cf -s
<3sg.f.r.o> -1sg|3sg.m|1pl.r.s
‘I would have eaten it’
Stress on the counterfactual suffix differentiates it from the progressive suffix
-rɨk- that occurs in some progressive constructions and is always unstressed (see
Sections 8.3.1 and 9.4.3).
(3) In most verbs inflected in the progressive aspect, stress falls on the final syllable of the verb stem for intransitive verbs, and on the ben object morpheme for
transitive verbs:
(2-16) a. yu anakŋa mernɨ warákakkut?
yu anakŋa mer=nɨ

(4) Class 4 verbs in the non-future tense take stress on the last syllable of the verb

(5) In the subjunctive mood, verb roots ending in /ɾ/ gain the vowel /ɛ/ before the
imperative ending, and that vowel is stressed, as in all imperatives, see (7) below:
(2-18) a. rar- (irr) ‘look’ → raré- (sbj, so: raré-tet, raré-tak, raré-nkem)
b. sir- (irr) ‘descend’→ siré- (sbj, so: siré-tet, siré-tak, siré-nkem)
(6) Intransitive verbs in irrealis dual forms take stress on the irr morpheme:
́
(2-19) a. ŋgrag ŋayarre okɨ tike
ŋgrag
ŋayar=re
o
-kɨ ́ -tike
afternoon really=temp go.irr -irr -dl.irr
‘let’s the two of us go in the really late afternoon’
b. pereipereikítike!
pereiperei -kí
-tike
race.irr
-irr -dl.irr
‘let’s the two of us race!’
(7) With imperative verbs, stress occurs on the final syllable of the imperative
stem rather than the word as a whole. For example moser ‘buy’ receives stress
on the final syllable of the stem rather than the word: mosé-tukun! (“buy it”). See
Sections 7.1.2.1 and 7.1.2.2.
(8) The subjunctive stems of class 4 verbs lose the final /ɾ/, if they have one, of
their irrealis stem and the remaining stem is always stressed. See Section 7.1.2.2.","[55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61]"
"1.6 Tayap linguistic profile
Like many Sepik languages, Tayap is a synthetic language. Verbs are the most
elaborated area of the grammar. They are complex, fusional and massively suppletive, with opaque verbal morphology including unpredictable conjugation
classes, both in terms of membership and formal marking. There are very many
suppletive stem forms marking a basic realis-irrealis distinction as well as various
other TAM categories. Person/number marking also differs depending on the verb
type. This is a language of “baroque accretions” (McWhorter 2001); or what Dahl
(2004) calls “mature phenomena”.
There is a fundamental distinction in verbal morphology between realis and
irrealis stems and suffixes, but this distinction is overridden by transitivity in the
prohibitive and counterfactual forms.
Grammatical relations are marked by verbal suffixes, which distinguish
S/A versus O. In some conjugations S/A is marked by discontinuous morphemes. Free pronouns and noun phrases mark the ergative case (A) compared
to unmarked forms for the absolutive (S/O). As in many Papuan languages
which have an ergative case, the ergative marker is optional and is frequently
omitted.
There are two genders, masculine and feminine, marked not on the noun
itself but on deictics, the ergative marker, suppletive verbal stems and verbal
affixes. The unmarked, generic form of all nouns, including animate nouns,
even humans, is feminine: however, a male referent may be masculine. Another
criterion is size and shape: long, thin and large referents tend to be masculine;
short, stocky and small referents tend to be feminine. Again this type of genderassignment system is typical of the Sepik region.
Gender is only ever marked in the singular, never in the dual or plural. Nouns
generally do not mark number themselves, although there is a small class of
largely human nouns which mark plural, and a smaller class which mark dual.
These categories, where marked, are largely marked by partial or full suppletion. Oblique cases, largely local, are marked by clitics attached to the end of the
oblique NP. Two adjectives also mark number, with partially suppletive forms for
singular, dual and plural. A further two adjectives have partially suppletive forms
for singular and plural.",[45]
"2.the pattern of alternation between the stem’s form in the non-future tense
and its form in the irrealis status (for example when it is negated or when it
denotes the future);
and
the nature of the stem changes that occur in the non-futurehttps://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-0061646 The formation of realis and irrealis verbsIn addition to these two kinds of patterned changes to the verb stem, three of the
five conjugation classes – classes 3, 4 and 5 – also mark the subject twice with a
discontinuous subject marker.
It was demonstrated in Section 5.2 how the root of a verb can be deduced from
knowing the form it takes when it is negated. With that in mind, notice once again
how the root of a verb like o ‘strike’ changes between the irrealis and the realis
stem forms, seen here in the contrast between future and non-future tenses:
(6-1) a. future ŋguyi okrutak

This kind of alternation is patterned and consistent, and it provides the basis
for distinguishing class 1 verbs (that alternate between the Ø form of the verb
stem in irrealis and -p- in realis), and class 2 verbs, which consist of verb stemsTransitive verb classes165that alternate between -w- in irrealis and -p- in realis (the hyphens indicate that
both phonemes can occur word-initially or word-medially, depending on the verb
in question).
Contrast both of those verb classes with conjugation class 3, which is characterized by a stem alternation between irrealis a and realis ka and o (depending on
the subject of the verb).

The final class of transitive verbs, class 5, is the simplest verb class. In class 5
verbs, the stem remains the same and does not change between the irrealis and
realis statuses. This regularity and simplicity is certainly one reason why all
foreign verbs that get incorporated into Tayap become inflected as class 5 verbs.1
It is also why speakers younger than thirty tend to conjugate all transitive verbs
as though they belonged to this verb class.","[183, 184, 185, 186]"
"8.2 Serial verb constructions (svc)
From the previous chapters, it should be amply evident that Tayap has an exuberance of verb forms. Until now, the presentation of Tayap verb forms has for
the most part concentrated on what we might somewhat understatedly call
‘simple verbs’: single, independent verbs that can take the full range of TAM
marking, as well as the full range of subject and object affixes, and function as
sole predicates.
In addition to these ‘simple’ verbs, though, Tayap has the possibility of
joining together verb stems in serial verb constructions (svcs) or complex predicates with the verb ‘to be’ in habituals and progressives (discussed below,
Section 8.3).
Tayap svcs are sequences of verb stems that encode a complex series of
actions. An example is tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana, a single complex predicate that
means ‘she will carry him down on her shoulders’:
(8-1) tapr
-at

intentionalSerial verb constructions like tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana, consist of three distinct
verb stems: two non-final verbs (tap ‘carry on shoulders’ and kv ‘bring1’), and the
final verb of motion atɨkɨ ‘go down’. The two non-final verbs take no marking
for TAM, but, being transitive, they do both take object morphemes. Note that
those two object morphemes -at and -ŋgɨ both encode 3sg.m. Furthermore, the
second one -ŋgɨ is inflected for TAM (in this case, realis status, since it is a non-final object suffix, as will be discussed in Section 8.2.2 below).
Two characteristics mark this word as a single predicate:
(1) the subject of the verb is shared, and encoded only once, on the final verb,
and the object of the first verb and subject of the second are shared; and
(2) the complex predicate can only be negated as a whole. Even though it consists of three distinct verb stems, tap, kV and atɨkɨ, only the final verb (the
same one that takes the subject marking) is negated.
So the negated form of this verb is:
(8-2) tapr
-at
kɨ
-ŋgɨ
carry_on_shoulders.irr -3sg.m.nfo bring -3sg.m.r.o
atɨ
-kɨ
wákare
go_down.irr -irr neg
‘(she) won’t (or didn’t) carry him down on her shoulders’
Further, tapratkɨŋgɨatɨkɨtakana is a single phonological word (see Section 2.7).
Note, however, that the boundary between the non-final object (nfo, which in
this case is -at; see below 8.2.2) and the main final verb that takes subject marking
1 The vowel harmonizes to the vowel of the object.","[249, 250]"
"7.1 Subjunctive (sbj)
Tayap has a distinct set of verb forms that encode a speaker’s desire that another
person do something. The underlying syntactic structure in which a subjunctive
appears is a subordinate clause (i.e. ‘I want that X do Y’), but a separate set of
subjunctive forms can also occur in a main clause. Since those forms only occur
in indirect commands, they are discussed below in Section 7.1.5.
The inflectional pattern for intransitive and transitive verbs in the subjunctive mood is as follows:https://doi.org/10.1515/9781501512209-007Subjunctive (sbj)201transitive verbssubjunctive verb stem inflected as class 5 verb + realis subject

verbs← a-nu-ku-remA verb like aiki ‘come’ notwithstanding, the subjunctive stem form of most verbs
has the same realization as the verb’s irrealis stem form. The exceptions to this
pattern are discussed in Sections 7.1.2.1 and 7.1.2.2 below.
The subjunctive in Tayap is used to express the following speech acts:
(a) direct imperatives (‘Take this food to Kapiru!’)
(b) jussive imperatives (‘Let her go’);
(c) indirect commands (‘Tell them to hit him’; ‘Make them go away’);
(d) wishes (‘I want you all to go to Sanae’)
Each of these four uses of the subjunctive involves different grammatical and syntactic components. A direct imperative can, by itself, constitute a sentence. Jussive
imperatives involve the fixed expression ŋganokaw, which does not change for
person or number. Indirect commands can be expressed in two ways, one using
the subjunctive in both the main clause and the subordinate clause; and one just
juxtaposing two independent clauses in the declarative mood. The expression of
a wish, similarly, has several forms, only one of which involves the subjunctive.","[220, 221]"
"Commentary
The narrator of this story is an example of a young passive active speaker, a villager
who never speaks more than a few formulaic phases of Tayap. She speaks Tok Pisin
to everyone: her children, her husband, her old mother, her siblings, and even her
mother-in-law, with whom she interacts every day, and who is a Tayap-dominant
woman in her late fifties. Despite the fact that this young woman never speaks
Tayap, she not only possesses solid grammatical competence in the language; she
is also able to activate that competence to produce narratives of relatively great
complexity. She is the youngest villager able to do this; her husband, who is 6 years
older, was able to produce a coherent narrative only with her active intervention.
Gapuners would judge this narrative to be a good story in terms of structure,
content and performance. It adheres to the village narrative convention of having
the protagonist or protagonists go off into the rainforest, have something happenTayap Text 4: Young men kill a cassowary317there, and then return, at the end of the story, back to the village. It contains
detail and a variety of perspectives. It is dramatic.
Grammatically, the narrative is complex. It contains a number of different
verbs of motion besides ‘go’ and ‘come’ (lines 4–5, 16, 21, 22, 36), serial verbs (lines
13, 15, 23, 36) and clauses coordinated with the clause subordinating morpheme
-re (lines 26, 51). All verbs but one are correctly inflected for subject – this speaker
makes none of the errors that most other young speakers make, discussed
throughout the grammar. The one inflectional error she does make is tuptukro
‘they went first’ in line 7; but she corrects herself and produces the correct form a
few words later. Her pronunciation of the word, /tuptuko/, deviates a bit from the
more usual tɨptuko, but it is within the range of acceptable variation.
The only grammatical mistakes made by the speaker both occur with regard to
the gender of the snake. For most of the narrative, the snake is correctly gendered
masculine. But three times, in lines 29, 33, and 42, it becomes feminine (even if line
29 is ambiguous, because it isn’t entirely clear what the speaker is referring to).","[336, 337]"
"Even though these two sentences can be translated the same way in English, they
are not synonymous in Tayap. The first example is the unmarked construction:
it is a simple declarative sentence consisting of a transitive class 1 verb stem (po)
suffixed by a 3sg.f object morpheme denoting the pig (-ku) and a subject ending
(-n) denoting ‘he’, all inflected for realis.
The second example is marked. It contains the same verb stem inflected for
realis, but instead of the object morpheme that refers to the pig that was shot,
what follows is a morpheme that means ‘mine’, ‘the one belonging to me’ or ‘the
one whose being shot had consequences for me’. Morphemes that encode this
relation often also encode the notion of benefit, and in keeping with other linguistic work on Papuan languages (e.g. Foley 1991: 307–11), here they are labeled
“benefactive”, even if the label is not entirely satisfying, because the actions
encoded by the verb do not necessarily entail benefit. In (7-29a)–(7-29b) above, for
example, the spearing of my pig may be malefactive, and it may have happened
contrary to the speaker’s knowledge, will or desire.
The ben morphemes highlight a relationship of possession and/or the consequences that an action or event have on the person or thing denoted by the
morphemes. In (7-29a) and (7-29b) above, a relation of possession is expressedBenefactive (ben)219in both examples, by means of the possessive pronoun ŋaŋan ‘my’. But while
possession is evident in the first example, it is emphasized in the second, partly
through the possessive pronoun (which can be omitted in this construction) and
partly through the benefactive morphology affixed to the verb stem.
Benefactive morphemes often occur on a transitive verb like ‘give’. Here the
possessive meaning of ‘what belongs to me’ or ‘what should belong to me’ is
evident.

examples (7-31c and d; see Section 6.1.4)Although as already noted, the benefactive morphemes do not necessarily carry
a positive meaning of benefit (something that is apparent from examples (7-31c –
7-31d) about bone-breaking), they often do express the meaning of doing something for the benefit of someone, even though it is often difficult in practice to
separate the sense of beneficiary from that of possession.

house’ and ‘Get rid of the house’s rubbish for her benefit’:

has been affected by an action or event, benefactive object morphemes can be
affixed to any verb stem – even an intransitive, stative verb like ‘be’.
One old woman once told a story of how she upbraided her teenage son for
taking money out of her net bag without her permission. “Yesterday you cried for
me to give you money”, she recounted herself saying, “and I gave you two kina to
buy biscuits, which you bought and ate”1.
After having established her prior generosity, the woman continued, saying
in a self-pitying voice:1 The kina, from the Tok Pisin word for ‘clam’, is Papua New Guinea’s main unit of currency.","[238, 239, 240]"
"2829 Simple and complex sentences9.10 Complex constructions with the suffix signifying
multiplicity -rar (ml)
The final suffix occurring on complex sentences is -rar. This suffix signifies
that the action denoted by the verb occurred in relation to multiple objects – so
‘look at many things’ instead of just ‘look’, or ‘shoot at many things’ instead of
just ‘shoot’. The suffix -rar is always used on transitive verbs. The object morpheme is always in the realis form. TAM is marked on the final, independent
verb of motion that follows the medial verb. Even though the action of the verb
happens multiple times, the object is still singular. So the structure of this form
is as follows:
transitive verb stem irr + object r + -rar + verb of motion inflected for
subject, TAM and status
Examples are as follows:
(9-49) a. tar
-ku
-rar mbet
take.irr -3sg.f.r.o -ml come.sg.m.r
‘he collected several as he came’ (or ‘I (m)’ or ‘you (m)’)
b. o
-ku
-rar mbot
shoot.irr -3sg.f.r.o -ml go.sg.m.r
‘he shot various things as he went’ (or ‘I (m)’ or ‘you (m)’)
If the object slot is filled by a ben object rather than a direct object, then -rar is
realized as -tar (see examples 9-49c and d below):
transitive verb stem irr + ben object r + -tar + verb of motion inflected for
subject, TAM and status
c. kokɨr krar

in the series. And like -kar verbs, the scope of negation covers the whole construction. So the negated form of (9-49a), above, is:

‘he didn’t come collecting several’9.11 Complex sentences in young people’s Tayap
Young people use a great deal of tail-head linkage in their narratives. The narrator of Text 4, for example – a twenty-year-old man with good passive Tayap but
limited active command of the language – uses tail-head linkage in fifty percent of
his clause conjunctions. Compare this with between roughly ten to twelve percent
in Texts 1–3, which were narrated by more fluent speakers.
Subordinate and cosubordinate clauses are beyond the capability of most
Tayap speakers younger than thirty. A few of the most skilled passive active speakers (such as the twenty-five-year-old narrator of Tayap Text 3) can use the subordinating morpheme -re to produce ‘when’ clauses (see lines 26 and 51 in Tayap Text 3).
But hypothetical morphemes – like the counterfactual mood that often accompanies it – are mostly dead, and in fifty five of the fifty six narratives by young people
that I collected in Gapun, there is not a single instance of relativization.8
Young people’s narratives are strings of events presented paratactically –
X did Y, Z happened, Q did P. Sometimes, the events are narrated with no
clause-linking morphology, as in the following extract, from a narrative told
by a twenty-three-year-old man (hesitations, false starts and interruptions and
encouragements by another speaker have been edited out of this extract):8 The single exception is a complex narrative in flawless Tayap told by a twenty-nine-year-old
young woman named Mbonika Amburi (the same Mbonika who features as a six-year-old girl
in the opening vignette of Kulick 1992). Mbonika is the paradigm example of the passive active
speaker. She never speaks more than a few formulaic phrases of Tayap to anyone, and knowing
her well and seeing her every day, I had come to assume that her command of the vernacular was
minimal. After being astonished by the fluency of her Tayap narrative, I asked her why she never
spoke the language. She is ashamed, she told me. She feared that if she spoke Tayap and said
something wrong, the old people in the village would laugh at her. “They’ll criticize”, she told
me. “They’ll say, ‘You all speak Tok Pisin too much and so you don’t know the vernacular’. For
that reason, I’m ashamed to speak the vernacular” (“Ol bai wokim koments, ‘Tok Pisin i planti na
yupela i no save long tok ples’. Na olsem na mi save sem long tok ples.”)2849 Simple and complex sentences(9-51) …Yim kuk. Yim kuk, ŋa embre, ŋa mbot. Paita ŋɨ mbet. ŋa taina, yim

Leaving aside the morphological and TAM errors made by this speaker (all of
which are typical of the kinds of errors made by young speakers), note that he
does not use a single coordinating, cosubordinating or subordinating morpheme
throughout this entire stretch of speech. The verb phrases that make up the narrative are simply placed one after the other with no linkage between them. (The
final a of the nonce word taina could be a coordinating morpheme, but this is
hard to know since the word doesn’t mean anything.)
Much more commonly than simply listing verb phrases one after the other,
young speakers link clauses with the coordinating conjunction -(y)a. Here is an
extract from a narrative about a pig hunt by a twenty-six-year-old man who is one
of the more advanced younger speakers in the village:

10 The speaker wants a non-future verb here – nitukun ‘she made’. But even the progressive verb
he uses is incorrectly inflected. The form he wants is nirkwanuk ‘she was making’.","[301, 302, 303, 304]"
"There are also sets of object-marking suffixes, for the benefactive mood (Section
7.5), also used in the transitive progressive (Section 8.3.1.2), and also for non-final
verbs (Section 8.2). These forms are as follows, repeated here for convenience
(note that these forms are perhaps better organized by number than person, but
to parallel other paradigms they are organized here by person):

sense that for all singular subjects, including 1sg, gender is obligatorily marked
on verbs through various means that for some verb classes includes changes in
the verb stem itself.
For example, note how the imperfective form of the verb ‘go’ (o) changes to
express gender for singular subjects:

second person: feminine and masculine first-person singular are both ŋa; feminine and masculine second-person singular are both yu. The pronominal system
distinguishes gender only in third-person singular (ŋɨ ‘he’ and ŋgu ‘she’). For
plural subjects, there is no gender distinction, neither in the pronominal system
nor in the morphology of verbs.
A further divergence between the pronominal system and verb morphology is
that Tayap, as noted above, has no separate dual pronoun, but it does have a dual
verb inflection for both transitive verbs (-re) and intransitive verbs (-tike). This
inflection signals ‘we two’ (1dl) or ‘the two of them’ (3dl).
Note, though, that ‘you two’ (2dl) is expressed with the second person plural
(yum) form of the verb. Compare:

pronouns operate under an ergative/absolutive alignment system whereas verbal
morphology operates under a nominative/accusative system (see Section 4.3).","[105, 106, 107]"
"5.4 Tense, aspect and mood in Tayap
5.4.1 Overview of Tayap verbal morphology
It should be clear by now that the fundamental distinction in Tayap’s verbal morphology system is between real and unreal events. Verb stems marked as realis or
irrealis combine with other suffixes that also are marked for TAM to make tense
distinctions, to express the progressive and habitual aspect, and to encode modal
notions like desire and prohibition.
The basic combinations, which can be modified by verbal suffixes and compounding to produce more tenses and aspects, are as follows:

in expected ways. While some verb forms (like verbs in the non-future or the
future) are composed of verb stems, object suffixes and subject suffixes that
all are marked for either realis or irrealis, other verb forms (the prohibitive
(Section 7.2) and counterfactual (Section 9.4.3)) mix these suffixes, and have, for
example, intransitive verb stems marked for irrealis, but object and subject suffixes inflected in their realis forms.
If an action or event has occurred, is occurring or occurs regularly, Tayap
encodes the following distinctions:Perfect (perf)actions or events that are completed; e.g. ‘He died’; ‘They
have finished the work’ (see Section 5.4.3.2).","[167, 168]"
