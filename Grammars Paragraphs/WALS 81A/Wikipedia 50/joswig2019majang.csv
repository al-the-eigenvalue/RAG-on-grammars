"III.2.2.1 Constituent order in main clauses
Dimmendaal (1998a, p. 66) reconstructs Proto-Surmic as probably showing
a verb-second order of constituents, which was changed in the DidingaMurle group to VAP via language contact from neighboring VAP-type
languages such as Toposa, Nyangatom and Turkana. This is contrary to
Unseth (1986b, p. 140), who analyzed Proto-Surmic as a verb-initial language. Indeed, in a Majang clause where the constituents A, verb and P are
overtly expressed, they frequently appear in the following order:
Verb – Subject – Object
Examples showing this order can easily be gleaned through elicitation:
Example III.17: basic constituent order VAP
a) ɓokotù jàrtíL nàːkɛ ɗɛpɛL.
ɓokot-í jàrtíL
nàːk-ɛ
kill-3S.DJ woman\SG.ERG.MOD POSS\1S.SG-ERG
My woman kills a lion.
b) kàwɛ wàr àdùre.
kàw-ɛ
wàr
bite-3S.DJ dog\SG.ERG
A dog bites a cat.ɗɛpɛL
lion\SG.ABSàdùre
cat\SG.ABSVAP is invariably the order of constituents when eliciting transitive clauses.
A Majang grammar entirely based on elicitation is unlikely to encounter any
other word order. But when looking at natural texts, it is by no means the
most frequent display of constituents in Majang. The only main-clause example of VAP in my narrative corpus is the following:Case Marking on Central Constituents127Example III.18: basic constituent order VAP in a main clause in natural discourse

see-3S.DJ Waalook\ERG path\SG.ABS house\SG.ABS Leer-POSS
Then, one day, Waalook saw the path to Leer’s house.","[132, 133]"
"Example b) shows the subject noun tɔ̀nL ‘child’ to be in new-information focus, as it is in the last position of the clause, following the object, and as a
topical constituent, because it is marked by the nominative case and followed by a modifier with the SFT-marker. The language consultants agree
that both clauses V.91b) and V.92b) cannot invert the order of subject and
object to the canonical order. This is very instructive for the interpretation of
central cases in Majang. If one were to pursue the analysis that the difference
between ergative and nominative was not grounded in topicality, but in focality, then all ergative occurrences would have to be explained as focused
constituents of a clause. The situation here now suggests that any constituent
in new-information focus appears at the end of a clause. But this is not the
place where ergative constituents are usually found. This implies that there is
an inherent difference between focus and ergative, which is confirmed by the
fact that when focus and topical constituent go together, as in example
V.92b), the nominative case is chosen.
The same can be tested for the P of a transitive clause. The response to a
question for the P can follow both a disjoint and a conjoint verb, and it can382Chapter V.7come with and without a sentence-final topicality marker. Again, all responses need to be interpreted as having a P in information focus.
Example V.93: question and response with topical and non-topical P in focus
a) ɗàm kɔ̀ dɔ̀mɔ̀ːn ɟíkon?
ɗàm
kɔ̀
dɔ̀mɔ̀ːn

"In these clauses, the A is invariably marked by the nominative case and is
just as invariably preposed. Having an alternative AVP structure is not unexpected according to Greenberg’s prediction that “all languages with dominant VSO order have SVO as an alternative or as the only alternative basic
order” (Greenberg, 1966, p. 110). But Unseth was not able to confirm this
prediction based on elicitation (1989b, p. 109):
“Deliberate attempts to elicit other word orders by topicalization did not produce any variants. Some SVO clauses were occasionally elicited at other times, such as in subordinate
clauses […]. My Majang helper consistently rejected the SOV
[sic!]43 examples in Bender’s article [...].”
This experience is a strong indication that the VAP order of constituents has
a firm psychological standing in the mental grammar of Majang speakers.
Although the AVP order has a high functional load in the syntax of the
language for re-establishing accessible participants, it is not something the
speakers have a conscious awareness of. Therefore mother-tongue translators
will have to be trained in the pragmatic significance of this structure, so that
43This is a typo in Unseth (1989). Bender (1983, p. 128f) presents rather unnatural AVP
examples.",[135]
"This clause is the first clause of a new episode in the narrative, with a change
of time and place, and the need to re-establish the discourse status of participants. This is also the only main-clause example in my corpus with an ergative lexical NP. Another rare example of VAP is the following subordinate
clause42:
Example III.19: basic constituent order VAP in a subordinate clause
àgútL cìnɔ̀ kánL ɓòkòtìːɗ ɗúŋéL cìnɛ càːkómL nɛːkík,

cì-n-ɛ
càːkómL
nɛːk=k
DEM-SG-HR
friend\SG.ABS POSS.3S.ABS=SUB
because that hyena had killed his friend,In this example background information is provided in an almost thetical
setting. As is shown in section V.9.1, the A or S is usually not overtly shown
in a clause if referring to an already activated participant. VAP is in fact a
very infrequent constituent structure, mostly used in thetical clauses lacking
any information accessible from the preceding context (which is what elicited sentences tend to be). This matches what Du Bois (2003, p. 48) calls
preferred argument structure, about which he claims that speakers “freely
realize full lexical noun phrases in intransitive subject position or transitive
object position, but strongly avoid placing them in transitive subject
position”. This goes together with another aspect of preferred argument
structure, that is the constraint that in a transitive clause “in discourse there
regularly appears just one full lexical noun phrase.” (Du Bois, 2003, p. 60).
Now in Majang the A, if not overtly shown as a full NP, usually also does
not appear as a free pronoun (see section IV.3.1.1). As it is only present
through subject indexation on the verb, it does not materialize as a discrete
constituent of the clause at all. Therefore, in narrative texts, transitive
clauses most frequently have a constituent order of VP:
42See example III.10 for a discussion of the case of the A constituent.",[133]
"III.2.2.3 Further typological observations relating to word order
Beyond the order of verb, S, A and P, the nuclear clause can also have indirect objects and further complements. These regularly follow the more
central constituents.
Example III.23: locative NP following the object
nɛ rìːɓé kàːrí kɔ̀nk ɗóːkL.
nɛ rìːɓ-ɛ
kàːrí
kɔ̀nk
ɗóːkL

kòcíé
nɛːk
ádá
CONJ put.inside-TF.3S.CJ pipe\sG.ABS POSS\3S.SG.ABS mouth\SG.DAT
He put her pipe into the mouth.",[137]
"This example does not display any imperative morphology, which is also
confirmed by the fact that the absolutive object at the end of the clause is
marked by the SFT-marker. My consultants agreed that it is neither more nor
less polite to place an order in this way. It is just a different option. The use
of the dative short pronoun in this example is different from the dative of
interest seen in other examples of orders; here it is used to refer to the indirect object of this ditransitive clause.",[396]
"V.2 The Structure of the Verb Phrase
The verb phrase105 in Majang may consist of the verb itself and a number of
accompanying words, which T. Payne (1997, p. 84) proposes to call auxiliaries, which is not the terminology chosen in this grammar. In Majang these
words are the tense markers introduced in section IV.3.4.2, and the short
pronouns introduced in section IV.3.1.1. They can also co-occur in the same
verb phrase, in the order tense marker – short pronoun:105This understanding of the verb phrase is different from definitions of the VP in generative
grammar models, where the VP may include all information that is not contained in the
subject NP, including the object NP. The verb phrase in Majang only contains the nonnominal material presented in the following discussion.",[340]
"III.2.2 Constituent order typology and its impact on case marking
This section presents the basic facts on the order of constituents in Majang
(III.2.2.1), and how this affects the analysis of Majang as a language with126Chapter III.2differential ergative marking, as some neighboring languages show differing
case-marking behaviors in pre-verbal and post-verbal positions. Section
III.2.2.2 shows that the state of affairs in Majang is quite different. Sections
III.2.2.3 and III.2.2.4 provide other observations about Majang constituent
order that do not affect the understanding of case marking, but that readers
may want to look for in this section because of important claims made by
previous grammars on Majang.","[131, 132]"
"Typological Overview49Many Majang verbs come in pairs of perfective and imperfective, where the
imperfective form is derived from the perfective form through partial reduplication (section IV.2.2.7). Furthermore, all verbs are inflected with subject
suffixes. Most verbs also distinguish between a tonal conjoint (CJ) form and a
disjoint (DJ) form; the conjoint form is only applied to verb phrases that are
immediately followed by a non-topical NP in the absolutive case (section
III.3). Another grammatical category frequently expressed on the verb is directionality, which comes in three values: centripetal (CP) forms, which
indicate a movement towards the deictic center; centrifugal (CF) forms, which
express a movement away from the deictic center; and deictic TransFer (TF)
forms, which are used for a movement from one deictic center to another
deictic center.
The basic order of constituents in Majang transitive clauses is VAP, where A
stands for the transitive agent and P for the transitive patient-like constituent,
usually the object. The order of constituents is fairly fixed in the language,
except for the option to front certain constituents (mostly subjects) for syntactic and pragmatic reasons (section V.7.1).
Pragmatic factors indeed have a major influence on the syntax of Majang.
The case marking of central participants of a clause depends on their topicality (section III.1). If they are not topical, S and P are marked by the same
absolutive case (examples a and b):
Example I.3: non-topical case marking of central constituents
a) kàwɛ èːɟɛː wárL kɛkàr.
kàw-ɛ
èːɟɛː

man\SG.ABS50Chapter I.11The non-topical A, however, is marked by a different case, the ergative (example I.3c). If topical, this A is marked by yet another case form, the nominative, which is also used for a topical S:

"381tɔ̀n
child\SG.ERGExample b) shows the A noun phrase, marked by the ergative case, as the
last element of the clause, even following the object. This pragmatically
marked structure is the only environment in which the order of subject and
object can be reversed in the language. This is also the case for an A marked
by the nominative case:

That aforementioned child ate meat.",[387]
"V.7.1 Constituent order variation
The basic constituent order of Majang was introduced in section III.2.2.1 as
verb – A/S – P – complements and adjuncts, with a preverbal slot that contains any temporal information of the simple clause. But it was also seen that
A and S constituents can be preposed to the preverbal position to re-activate
the participants (see section III.2.2.2).
More fronting happens with noun phrases marked as contrastive topics, even
beyond the subject.
Example V.81: fronting of NPs with contrastive topic
a) íꜜtó ré cénkL ɗàɗàmùn júmój?
íꜜtó

"This is a somewhat fascinating construction. The short pronoun tà is semantically the same as the 1S.DAT pronoun tàL seen in example V.12. This results
in a dative NP preceding the absolutive object, which again would violate
the order of constituents in Majang. The canonical order of constituents is
only preserved by the assumption that tà is part of the verb phrase. This is
confirmed by the change of tone to L on the particle, which is best explained
as the conjoint marking of the VP, because the VP as a whole is followed by
a non-topical absolutive NP. In this, tà mirrors the tonal behavior of tense
markers, which also take on the conjoint marking in the appropriate environ-The Structure of the Verb Phrase337ment. Assuming that these short pronouns are part of the verb phrase therefore avoids having to assume a special constituent order just for their sake.
Short pronouns can also precede the verb, as in the following sentence:
Example V.17: short pronoun preceding the verb
nɛ kɔ̀ːL nà díːleːr èpcón.
nɛ kɔ̀ːL nà
díːl-ɛːr
èpcón
CONJ NFUT 2S.DAT carry-CF.3S Epheson
Epheson will bring it out to you.","[342, 343]"
"Examples a) and b) are orders to a second person, and example c) is an impersonal construction. The recipient is coded as dative in all cases. Example
b) actually has two dative constituents; beyond the recipient the speaker introduces himself as the beneficiary into the proposition, which is marked as a
dative short pronoun inside the verb phrase.
The benefactive can of course also be used with intransitive verbs. The following example rather shows a malefactive use of the dative case with the
intransitive verb ŋàːr ‘go’:
Exàmple V.54: benefàctive ùse with intransitive verbs

go\3S.DJ RECPST 1S-DAT towards husband\SG.ABS POSS\3S.SG.ABS=SUB
She left me towards her husband. (lit: She went – against me – to her husband.)All in all, the nature of the dative case marking as a non-central case of
Majang gives the impression that the third argument of Majang ditransitive
verbs carries less syntactic prominence than can be observed in countless
other African languages. Whereas many Bantu languages treat it on par with
the object or even as the only object of ditransitive constructions, as described in Joswig (1996) for Swahili, and whereas several Afro-Asiatic languages of Ethiopia show similar structures, in the Majang language the recipient is always coded by the dative case. In order to give it a more central
status, one needs to use the TF-form in the recipient-removal constructionGrammatical Relations in the Simple Clause357(section V.5.4). In this sense, the language needs to be seen as a directobject language in the terminology of Dryer (1986, p. 815), or a patientoriented language according to my own terminology (Joswig, 1996, p. 62).","[362, 363]"
"Continuity (Cohesion) and Discontinuity409V.9.1 Topical (referential) continuity
The Majang language shows topical continuity by referring to ongoing topical constituents in a minimal way. The default clause structure of Majang is
VP or VS, depending on transitivity, as codified in the least marked order of
constituents Verb – NPABS (see section III.2.2.1). This assumes that the subject is identical with a current activated participant. In this case, the subject
is not expressed overtly in the clause, but just through indexing by the subject marker on the verb.
Example V.145: topical continuity in Majang discourse
làkɛL ɓà ɟàrtí om cínɔ̀ làkí àmɗùk. nɛ ɓáL ɓeɲ omàlte lák ŋɔ̀ɗɔ̀ kàːríonk.

CONJ REMPSTIn this example the initial sentence introduces the main character of the narrative, by using a full NP giving the necessary information about this participant. In the next clause this participant is then an activated participant, and
topical continuity allows the participant to be no longer mentioned overtly
except by indexing on the verb. Adjustments are only necessary when new
participants are introduced, or when different participants become activated
in rapid succession.
A participant can keep its activated status as object in the next clause by the
use of the referential-object verb form (see section IV.2.3.5).

I want to thank the following people for their contribution to this study:
The main language consultant for this study was Joseph Kalakun. In many of
the research sessions Joseph was supported by his colleagues of the Majang
Bible Translation Project, Hawariyat Babure, Epheson Teramaj, and, until
2011, Abyot Girma. This was graciously permitted by the Illubabor Bethel
Synod of the EECMY. James Kim and Gallo Aylate helped setting up the research sessions. Furthermore, James and his wife Whashu shared their
knowledge and material on the Majang language.
Other Majang speakers contributing to this work were Yordanos Addisu,
Kadiree Nyamor, Nibeyat Dimesse, and Ashine Astin.
Tyler Schnoebelen generously shared his personally collected Majang Data
with me. Sandra Hufnagel transcribed most words of the Comparative African Word List, initially supported by Stefanie Hauser.
Pete Unseth shared more data and analysis with me. He once intended to
write this very language description, and I am glad that he entrusted me with
completing this work.
I am grateful to Drs. Moges Yigezu and Getachew Anteneh for the ideas and
inspiration we shared with each other while working on the same language.
I benefited from practical help by various friends and colleagues. David Ford
spent hours editing sound files, and even more on proofreading. Seyoum
Berhe translated materials from Amharic to English. Tefera Endalew provided logistical help in Mizan Teferi. Other workers of the Bench-Maji MLE
project, particularly Efrem Belay, helped me immensely in later stages.
My doctoral supervisor Maarten Mous and co-promoter Constance KutschLojenga gave good feedback on all parts of this study, and more came from
the committee members Gerrit Dimmendaal, Doris Payne, Jenneke van der
Wal and Maarten Kossmann. Further conversations I had with Mary Pearce,
Keith Snider, Helga Schröder, Colleen Ahland, Michael Ahland, Mike
Bryant, Joshua Smolders, Anne-Christie Hellenthal, Don Killian, Manuel
Otero, Mike Cahill, Roger Blench, and Tom Payne. More occasional advice
was given by numerous participants on the SIL Linguistics Discussion List.
Colin Davis created the language map on page 37. Anne-Christie Hellenthal
provided the Dutch Samenvatting at the end of this book.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"103Part III: Basic Syntax
The grammatical part of this language description is divided into three major
sections. Part IV: Morphology introduces the various forms encountered in
the Majang language, whereas Part V: Other Syntactic and Pragmatic
Topics provides a detailed account of how the Majang language creates
larger grammatical structures, mostly from a functional perspective. But
before introducing the forms and structures, this preliminary part III is
needed, which sets the context by presenting the various systems that contribute to the understanding of the information structure in the clause. The
following concepts need to be discussed in some detail, so that they can be
used in the succeeding parts IV and V: topicality, differential ergative marking, differential-S marking, pre-verbal and post-verbal case marking (and
other aspects of basic constituent order typology), the conjoint- and disjoint
distinction, and the sentence-final topicality marker ( SFT). Each of these is
introduced in the following sections and subsections.
This means that these concepts have to be introduced without detailed information on forms and paradigms; sufficient information is given to show that
indeed there is a justification for the establishment of these concepts, but all
formal and structural details are introduced in the following parts IV and V.
This hopefully reduces any repetition to a necessary minimum.","[108, 109]"
"III.2.2.4 Question particles and question words
Unseth (1986a, p. 97) pointed out that the Majang language violates Greenberg’s (1966, p. 111) 12th universal, which states that “if a language has dominant word order VSO in declarative sentences, it always puts interrogative words or phrases first in interrogative word questions […].”
This universal is indeed violated in Majang, as the interrogative pronouns
and question words are always found at the end. See section V.7.3.2 for the
use of these interrogative pronouns.
Example III.26: question words at the end of the clause

"Whether in a previous stage of the language the conjoint form was used preceding all non-topical constituents cannot be decided due to lack of published data from any other related language. Currently one can only go by
today’s situation in Majang, which firmly places the conjoint form in front of
non-topical absolutive NPs, and the disjoint form in all other contexts.
So far the conjoint-disjoint distinction was only observed in languages which
do not make use of case marking. The syntactic status of an NP in Bantu languages can be captured by the more general terms subject, object, and adjunct, which are the terms used in the descriptions of Bantu conjoint-disjoint
distinctions (Creissels, 2012, p. 18 f; Van der Wal, 2011, p. 1738). In
Majang, instead, the syntactic properties of a noun phrase are closely related
to its case marking, and therefore the language must make reference to aConjoint-Disjoint Distinction137particular case (the absolutive) in order to assign the correct marking to each
verb.
It was stated above that conjoint status is a feature of the verb phrase, not
just of the verb. This is because in situations where the verb is followed by a
tense marker, such as kɔ̀, kɔ̀ː and ɓà, it is not the verb that is marked for conjoint, but the tense marker. The verb appears therefore in the (apparently unmarked) disjoint form, although the whole VP is conjoint (section IV.3.4.2).
The conjoint-disjoint distinction is quite useful for the syntactic interpretation of language data. The nature of the Majang case system does not allow
for an easy identification of case forms for each noun, as the differences between nominative, absolutive and ergative are usually expressed only tonally
or through idiosyncratic stem changes, if indeed they are expressed at all.
The conjoint-disjoint distinction therefore frequently allows a clear identification between some homophonous case forms, as in the following
examples:
Example III.30: case disambiguation through conjoint and disjoint verb forms

wàrL
sleep\3S.CJ dog\SG.ABS
A dog sleeps again.kɛkàr.
againb) ɗeːgàr
wàr

sleep\3S.DJ dog\SG.NOM house\LOC
The dog sleeps at the house.","[142, 143]"
"Sentence Tone99II.8 Sentence Tone
Apart from the two tone levels and downstep, Majang also displays some
tonal phenomena which operate on higher levels than the phonological word.
I call these phenomena sentence tone in order to distinguish them from less
predictable emotive pitch phenomena which are often called intonation in
the literature and are unhelpfully lumped together with what is called sentence tone here. This study does not address intonation in this narrower sense
of the word, but restricts the description to phenomena that can be linked to
the syntactic structure of the utterance.","[104, 105]"
"Furthermore, example V.93c) shows a disjoint form preceding a constituent
which apparently is in a new-information focus position, as the response to a
content question47. If the conjoint form cannot be reliably encountered in
front of constituents with new-information focus, then focus is apparently
not what the conjoint form signals.48
My previous publication on the conjoint-disjoint distinction (Joswig, 2015)
asserted that the distinction was based purely on syntactic parameters (p.
175). But this was written before I fully understood the importance of topicality in Majang. Assuming topicality as the starting point of the conjointdisjoint distinction in Majang, as envisioned by Van der Wal (2011, p.
1735), would render the language much more similar to the state of affairs in
Tswana, as described by Creissels (2012, p. 18), which also has a super47For a discussion of wh-questions as diagnostics for new-information focus, and some
caveats, see Van der Wal (2016, p. 264ff).
48
Van der Wal (p.c.) points toward a possibility how conjoint and focus may still be indirect ly related in Majang; the assumption would be that verb phrases are marked as conjoint
when the adjoining NP is counted as being inside the VP constituent – this would only ever
happen to absolutive NPs, but only when they refer to unexpected or new, that is, focal entities. Question words in Majang are apparently outside their linear order in the clause (see
section III.2.2.4), and therefore also outside the VP constituency, which would explain the
disjoint marking preceding focal material. The same would have to be assumed for disjoint
marking preceding NPs denoting responses to questions, such as in example V.93c).",[141]
"V.1 The Structure of the Noun Phrase
The head noun appears at the beginning of a noun phrase. The order of constituents is as follows:
head noun – demonstrative/possessive – relational noun – quantifier –
relative clause

a) òláL cìgì bàŋɛ

all his days330Chapter V.1It was shown in section IV.3.3 that quantifiers are less closely connected to
the noun phrase than demonstratives or possessives. While these trigger the
modified form of certain cases on the noun, any quantifier (if not joined by a
demonstrative or possessive, as in example V.1) leaves the head noun in a
non-modified state.
Example V.2: quantifier and noun
òlátL
bàŋɛ
things\NOM all
all thingsIn this example, as opposed to example V.1a), the quantifier is the only other
constituent relating to this noun, and the noun appears in its plain form òlátL
instead of in the modified form òláL. It therefore appears as if the quantifier
is not really part of the noun phrase. The same is true for all relative clauses
– they leave the head noun in the plain, not in the modified state.
Example V.3: noun followed by relative clause
ɟóːpL cìgì rɛbɛcꜜkáːnáꜜkík
ɟóːpL
cì-g-ì
rɛbɛcL-káːn-àkL=k
people\ABS REL-PL-SP trouble-NOMIN-PL.ABS=SUB
persons that are troublemakersIn this example the plain absolutive plural form ɟóːpL is used as the headword, not the modified form ɟóːL. It is interesting to note that in spite of their
formal similarity, the demonstrative and relative pronouns have a different
effect regarding the modification status of the noun that precedes them; demonstratives trigger a modified case form, whereas relative pronouns do not.
Relational nouns typically convey spatial information and derive from
nouns. See section IV.3.6 for a discussion about their status as part of the
noun phrase. Relational nouns always appear as the last element of a noun
phrase, but preceding any quantifiers.

"130Chapter III.2they can apply it appropriately without being unduly guided by the structure
of the source language.
Fronting the A-constituent to re-activate an accessible participant has striking
similarities with what has been observed as word-order alternations in other
related Eastern-Sudanic languages. For example, A-constituents in Southeast-Surmic Suri-Tirmaga (Bryant, 1999, p. 45ff), Western-Nilotic Päri
(Andersen, 1988, p. 293f) and Southwest-Surmic Baale (Moges & Dimmendaal, 1998, p. 297) are case-marked when appearing in post-verbal position,
but unmarked when in pre-verbal position. These languages have in common
that they place the unmarked or absolutive S preceding the verb. It would
therefore be tempting to describe Majang in similar terms, where the preverbal position is the place to show all constituents in unmarked or neutral
case, and contrast these forms with the constituents found in the post-verbal
position, where the A-constituents are case-marked, either with the nominative or ergative case, depending on the other findings in the language. It is
probably such a perspective that prompted the previous analysis of Majang
as a marked-nominative language (König, 2008, p. 191).
But the data presented so far makes it clear that the situation is quite dif ferent from that found in marked-nominative languages such as Suri-Tirmaga
or Baale. The case marking of pre-verbal constituents can in no way be characterized as neutral or unmarked, as it is different from the absolutive case
of postverbal P- or S-constituents. The following observations can be made
about the pre-verbal position:
•Ergative-marked constituents cannot be fronted.","[135, 136]"
"Therefore the following order of constituents can be established for the
nuclear clause:
verb – (S/A) – object (P) – complement
Temporal information is usually not placed into the nuclear complement slot,
but into a pre-nuclear slot. Any kind of pre-nuclear temporal information,
however, requires the presence of a preceding conjunction. This may be the132Chapter III.2reason why almost any clause in a narrative text, even a main clause, begins
with some kind of conjunction, usually the connector nɛ.

"The conjoint form of the 3S suffix in example a) has a low tone. The disjoint
form instead has a fixed high tone (example b).
These examples show that tone plays a major role in the Majang language,
and needs to be considered very carefully in order to understand not only the
phonology, but also the morphology and the syntax of the language.",[104]
"IV.2.1.2 Finite verbs
The finite verb in Majang follows this template (Figure 9):
Stem – Extension – Direction – Relative Tense – Referential Object –
Person (+ conjoint/disjoint)
Figure 9: affix template of finite verbsNone of the suffix slots are filled for all verbs. There are some zero allomorphs among the person morphemes, and the extension slot and the relative
tense slot are rarely used. Each verb could also be followed by various
clitics, such as the sentence-final topicality marker =ŋ or the subordinateclause marker =k. Any simple or derived stem may serve in the stem slot;
some means of derivation are introduced in section IV.2.2 below. The extension slot may contain the semantically empty suffix -k in front of some
person markers, but only in certain verb classes. It is inserted for phonological reasons, and it never appears in the same verb with a relative tense
marker or a direction marker; therefore the relative order between these is
not relevant, except that the analysis proposed here sees the extension as an
extension of the stem. The direction slot follows the stem directly only for
81For the i-class, the 3S, 2P and the 3P forms are also defined by the class-vowel, but they are
subject to the labial-harmony rule 4, which changes short /i/ to /ù/ for the verb lòw.",[216]
"In these examples, the A of the transitive clause is marked by the ergative
case, as evidenced by the HL sequence on the last syllable of the proper
name in example a), and by the special ergative form of the interrogative
pronoun (see p. 387 for the other case forms of this pronoun) in example b).
In example a), the ergative is chosen for a main participant following a reset
of time and place, and with a different subject than in the previous clause. In
example b) the ergative is used for a question word asking for an unknown
subject; the object of this clause is left-dislocated (see section V.7.1.2) to a
position outside the clause. A less clear example shows an NP in the ambiguous form that is identical for both the modified nominative and the
modified ergative:114Chapter III.2Example III.10: textual example with ergative case assumed by word order

because that hyena had killed his friend,The NP ɗúŋéL cìnɛ can be either nominative or ergative according to its morphological shape. The reason to assume that it is ergative in this clause is its
position following the verb, where in clear textual examples nominative ANPs were never encountered (see section III.2.2.1).
These rare examples taken from natural discourse are balanced by countless
examples from elicitation, using questionnaires with context-free example
sentences, where practically every transitive clause yields an ergative-absolutive pattern, illustrated in the following clauses:

man\SG.ABSUndoubtedly these examples are unnatural in the sense that it is very difficult to find them in narrative discourse. The factor of preferred argument
structure, as proposed by Du Bois (1987, 2003), in combination with the tendency of Majang to avoid free pronouns for subjects, explains the very low
frequency of ergative-marked noun phrases in natural texts. Preferred argument structure discourages the use of a full NP as an A argument. An NP thatCase Marking on Central Constituents115is not there cannot be marked for ergative, which renders the ergative case
invisible in a language that only ever marks it on an NP.
Still, it would be unwise to discount the information gleaned from such examples on the basis that they do not come from narrative texts. It remains a
fact that when a Majang speaker is asked to produce a transitive sentence,
without fail s/he first comes up with an ergative-absolutive case pattern in a
VAP clause. This alignment system therefore represents a deeply ingrained
grammatical structure that probably sees prominent use in everyday natural
discourse, but not in the kind of structured texts that linguists tend to analyze
for writing their grammars. The observer is faced with the notion that “when
a departure from Preferred Argument Structure does occur in natural discourse, the resulting utterance bears not a hint of ungrammaticality” (Du
Bois, 2003, p. 78). After all, “Preferred Argument Structure cannot be reduced to a grammatical rule. It must remain within the domain of discourse,
as a patterning of grammar with consequences for grammar” (ibid).
Now it still needs to be asked where exactly in natural discourse the ergative-absolutive alignment system thrives to the point that it appears as the
grammatical system of choice in almost all elicited transitive clauses; if no
one ever uses it in any speech situation at all, this alignment system would
be quickly forgotten by the grammar. Looking outside the narrative genre, in
my case, did not provide the answer: one text of my corpus is a planning
conversation between three speakers with well over 150 clauses, and still the
ergative case does not feature in this at all. The same is true for a short hortatory text. It therefore remains a rewarding task for future research 32 to determine the segments or genres of Majang natural discourse that freely admit
the use of ergative-absolutive systems. My hypothesis is that they must exist,
and that I just have not found them.
As for the alternative to this ergative-absolutive alignment system: as stated
above, the main reason why it is almost impossible to see ergative-marked
NPs is preferred argument structure. But even an existing A-NP is usually
32Watters (2018, p. 394ff) conducted such research for the Tibeto-Burman language Dzongkha, comparing the impact of genre on competing case-marking patters. For that language,
Watters concluded that “grammatical relations in Dzongkha is found to range from a splitergative system to a pragmatic system, whereby the manifestation of one marking pattern
over another is probabalistically dependent on and functionally motivated by genre.” The
exact findings, however, are very different from the situation in Majang, showing a higher
probability for ergative-marked As in monologic texts.","[119, 120, 121]"
"IV.3.6 Adpositions
One of the Majang language’s claims to fame up to this point was its alleged
use of postpositions in spite of its VAP nature. Unseth (1989b, p. 106) states
that words like ràŋ ‘top’, tàk ‘inside’ and wàlɛc ‘from outside’ are postpositions, linking these to similar findings in Murle (Arensen, 1982, p. 117) and
Didinga (Odden, 1983, p. 169). Therefore, these Surmic languages apparently contradict Greenberg’s (1966, p. 78) language universal 3, stating that
“languages with dominant VSO order are always prepositional.”
Contrary to Unseth’s findings, these words show several characteristics that
preclude their interpretation as postpositions. T. Payne (1997, p. 87) states
that adpositions derive historically from nouns or verbs, and that a good way
to find out if a word is one or the other is its behavior. When it is a verb or a
noun, it takes on verbal or nominal inflection markers; when it is a preposition, it doesn’t. Applied to Majang, one needs to see whether the stated
words still can take on nominal morphology (as they apparently go back to
nouns) or not. Now, the two words ràŋ ‘top’ and tàk ‘inside’ can indeed be
inflected for case. They show up in this form when the noun they relate to is
locative:318Chapter IV.3Example IV.280: tàk and ràŋ with locative case

"Although this sentence has some morphological complications, such as the
use of a serial-verb construction to express an associated motion, and the usePragmatically Marked Structures375of the dative to express possession on a kinship noun, the sentence does not
deviate from the basic clause configuration. The verb is directly followed by
an absolutive noun phrase, and therefore none of the pragmatic markings
provided by the language are in evidence. The verb appears in the conjoint
form, indicating that the P is non-topical, and no sentence-final topicality
marker is placed. The constituent order is in compliance with the canonical
VAP of Majang.
Other pragmatically relevant features are also set to the default: the sentence
is affirmative, and therefore has no negative morphology. It is a declarative
sentence, therefore there is no question morphology or sentence tone involved, and also no imperative or jussive morphology is in evidence.
This section now presents the effects of any changes to this default pragmatic setting: markings for individual constituents as topical or focus, negation, questions, and imperatives with jussives.","[380, 381]"
"V.6 Tense, Aspect and Mode
Tense, aspect and mode (TAM) are grammatical features that provide information about the non-spatial setting of a proposition (Dixon, 2012, p. 1ff).
Studying these extensively requires a very deep look into how the Majang
language community views events and their temporal structure. This section
does not attempt to get close to a comprehensive treatment of these parameters in the Majang language. This would have required much more space,
and, more importantly, a bigger text corpus in order to identify the various
functions covered by the devices used in the Majang language. It is therefore
important to state beforehand that the area of tense, aspect and mode remains
an area for very rewarding future research.",[371]

"Verbs231IV.2.2.4 Derivation marker -à
Another derivation formative on verbs is -à, with variable tone, which creates stems that either have an expelling meaning, that is an object is transported out, or possibly a completive meaning. Again, the marker does not
appear to be used productively, and there are derived verbs with unattested
root forms.

"Tone89In both examples, a noun with a final H is followed by the 1S.SG.ABS possessive pronoun, which also has an inherent H. In example a), this high
tone on the pronoun is downstepped, whereas in example b), it is on the
same register as the preceding high tone. In order to account for this difference, it is necessary to assume that the noun in example a) is accompanied by some device that lowers the register for the rest of the clause.
The noun in example b), however, is not accompanied by such a register-lowering device. For the purposes of this section, it is not important
to decide whether this device lowering the register is part of the preceding noun stem or an affix that is only attached to the nouns of a particular inflection class (see the section on singular marking on p. 150 for
more information). In either case, the proposed analysis assumes that the
noun in example a) is accompanied by a floating L that causes the lowering of the register on the following possessive pronoun. This floating L
is absent in example b), and no phonological reason beyond posing such
a floating L can be identified that determines which noun causes a
downstep and which doesn’t. In this study, I call this kind of non-automatic downstep word downstep, as it crosses word boundaries. In the
2879-word text sample, this kind of downstep occurs 882 times. As this
floating low tone is a part of the lexical material of the utterance, it is in
this study always written (with the superscript L), even if it does not have
a phonetic effect preceding words beginning with a low tone.
2. When two separate underlying high tones come together within a word
across morpheme boundaries, the first syllable of the second morpheme
is affected by a lowering of the register. This happens in order to avoid
an obvious violation of the Obligatory Contour Principle. Cahill (2004,
p. 5) lists a number of other African languages (Kishambaa, Supyire and
Namwanga) which share this behavior. The situation in Namwanga particularly mirrors the evidence in Majang (Bickmore, 2000, p. 302f). This
non-automatic downstep only operates between morphemes within a
word. Two high tones meeting across word boundaries do not trigger
downstep if no floating L is involved (see example II.26b). The analysis
proposed here does not assume the presence of a floating L between the
two underlying high tones triggering the morpheme downstep. Such a
floating L is present neither underlyingly, nor as a product of a phonological rule creating the downstep. The downstep is a lowering of the
register, and is not caused by the insertion of an unrealized low tone.
This agrees in principle with Odden’s (1986, p. 366) interpretation of the90Chapter II.6
facts in Kishambaa. This form of non-automatic downstep is therefore
fundamentally different from the word downstep introduced above, and
is accordingly indicated by a different orthographic symbol (ꜜ).
Example II.27: non-automatic downstep within a word
coːꜜmoj tree, sp.
[]
HHThis noun consists of the root morpheme plus the non-productive nominalizer -oj (see example IV.125). I call this kind of non-automatic downstep morpheme downstep, as it crosses morpheme boundaries only, but
never word boundaries. This kind of downstep is much less frequent
than the word downstep, with only 87 occurrences in the 2879-word text
sample.
Both types of non-automatic downstep may involve the same word, as the
following noun phrase illustrates:
Example II.28: combination of downsteps
wákàꜜcàkɛL
gàːnɛ
[
L
L
{wákàc-àk-ɛ
gàːn-ɛ }
crossroads-PL-LOC POSS\1S.PL-LOC
at my crossroads]This example has two downsteps operating on the noun wákàꜜcàkɛL. The first
downstep following the stem wàkàc is caused by the addition of the plural
suffix -àk, which has its own underlying high tone. The high tone on wàkàc
spreads out over both syllables of the stem and therefore stays on the same
register. The presence of the new H on -àk is announced by the morpheme
downstep between the two morphemes. The H on -àk spreads out to the next
morpheme, the toneless locative marker -ɛL. As no new tone is involved, the
register stays the same on the two syllables -àkɛL. Although the locative
marker -ɛL is toneless as such, and therefore available for the copying of the
H on -àk, it is accompanied by a floating low tone. This floating L then
causes the H on gàːnɛL to be downstepped, according to the principle of word
downstep.
Although minimal pairs entirely based on non-automatic downstep are rare,
they do exist. Quite frequently the contrast is used for the paradigmatic distinction between absolutive nouns (ABS) and nominative nouns (NOM).","[94, 95, 96]"
"The three different case forms of ‘dog’ – wàrL (ABS), wàr (ERG) and wàr (NOM)
– are only distinguished by tone, but different they are. Two more clauselevel cases are used by the Majang language, the dative (DAT) and the locative (LOC), plus a further possessive (POSS) case to mark nouns as possessors of
a noun phrase. A detailed discussion of the cases and their use is presented in
sections IV.1.3.2 and III.2.1.2.
Though the constituent order VAP is normal, the verb is often found at the
end of the sentence. In that situation, another morpheme is attached to the
verb, the sentence-final topicality marker =ŋ (SFT). This marker indicates
that the final constituent is either the verb phrase or a topical noun phrase
(see section III.4 for its discussion).
The language makes use of some valence-changing devices. Most notable
among those is the antipassive (AP) (section V.5.1). A genuine passive construction in the sense of Dixon (2010a, p. 166) is not encountered in the language – its function is partly covered by the impersonal form, an inflectional
device described in section IV.2.3.1.
In spite of Unseth’s (1989b, p. 106) claim to the contrary, Majang does not
have postpositions, and only a few questionable prepositions (section IV.3.6).
Relative clauses are very frequent in Majang, and can be both restrictive and
descriptive (section V.8.5). Some temporal adverbial clauses have subordinate-tense verb forms (section V.8.3.1). Otherwise tense is only expressed
through tense markers which appear to be working along the lines of a
metrical tense system (section V.6.1.1).",[56]
"V.7.4 Orders and hortatives
The Majang language has a dedicated paradigm for imperative and jussive
forms (see section IV.2.3.4 for their formation). These are frequently used,
but Majang speakers have additional options to exhort people to do what
they want.
Majang imperative and jussive clauses have in common that they never show
a sentence-final topicality clitic (SFT).",[395]
"In both cases, the two questions do not differ in their order of constituents or
in any other morphological way from their affirmative counterparts. The
only difference is a sharply rising sentence tone at the end of the clause, as in
the following (stereo) pitch curve of example a):Figure 10: pitch drawing of máL kɔ̀ːL èːt mó?",[389]
"38Chapter I.3It appears that the Majang originated from places further south, probably
near the Boma plateau in South Sudan (Stauder, 1970, p. 108). Since the Majang do not own cattle and live in otherwise unpopulated forests, they have
moved gradually northwards, establishing settlements in the previously ample forest areas of western Ethiopia. In the course of this, they probably did
not displace other populations, except possibly the Shabo, who are the only
other forest dwellers in the area. During Stauder’s time, all but the northern
(near Dembidolo) Majang settlements were inhabited for a longer time than
collective memory could establish (Stauder, 1970, p. 110).
The southern origin of the Majang people is supported by considerations of
syntactic typology. Dimmendaal (1998a, p. 66) assumes a verb-second basic
word order for Proto-Surmic, which changed to a strict VAP pattern for the
Didinga-Murle languages through language contact with neighboring Nilotic
languages. The Majang language also follows a VAP pattern, but without
having any VAP languages in its immediate neighborhood. Dimmendaal
(1998a, p. 77) therefore states that “the verb-initial structure of Majang remains somewhat enigmatic historically, given its current geographical position [...] i.e. given the absence of strict verb-initial languages in the immediate vicinity of this language.” An origin from near the Boma plateau would
place the Majang ancestors in the immediate vicinity of some Nilotic VAP
languages, and this would explain Dimmendaal’s enigma.","[43, 44]"

"344Chapter V.3In this example the predicate ɟóːpL is modified by a relative clause, which in
itself has a nominal predicate without a copula or any other verbal introduction.
In an important way this construction is exceptional for Majang. Whereas in
all other constructions the S usually follows the predicate (if it is not fronted
into a preverbal position), here the predicate clearly follows the S. There is
no indication that any fronting of the S has happened, as there is no alternative to this construction that would have the S following the predicate. An
explanation may be that in such a construction the S usually refers to known
information, whereas the predicate constitutes new information – the structure seen here therefore grammaticalizes the iconic representation of the
order old–new.","[349, 350]"
"Quite often, as in examples a) and b), the speaker can place the 1S.DAT short
pronoun as a dative of interest into the clause to indicate that s/he is the beneficiary of the action. Just as often as the imperative form speakers use the
regular 2S indicative verb form to give something that very much sounds like

"V.7.3 Questions and focus
This section presents a short overview of questions and focus phenomena, as
far as they have been studied so far.
Majang contrastive focus is accomplished by the use of the contrastive pronouns (see section IV.3.1.1). Contrastive focus often entails a choice from
already known entities, which is why Dik (1989, p. 278) cautions against
equating focus with information new to the hearer. This is therefore a pragmatically different situation from new-information focus, as defined by
Thwing and Watters (1987, p. 101): “Focus: that information in an utterance
which the speaker believes, assumes or knows that the hearer does not share”.
Information questions are a widely accepted and applied test for new-infor mation focus (Van der Wal, 2016, p. 264ff), as the component in question is
assumed to be in focus. The expected answer provides confirmation or information, and as such is always new information (Dixon, 2012, p. 377). Studying questions can therefore be revealing about focus structure, because, as
Dik (1989, p. 280) points out, “if a language has special strategies for the
expression of focus constituents, these strategies will typically be also used
for question words.”
The Majang language, in spite of its VAP syntax, places information with
new-information focus at the end of the clause, and does so also with interrogative pronouns, which fill the slot of new information. The responses to
questions fill exactly the same slot as the question words that solicited them:
Example V.91: information packaging in questions and their responses
a) ɗàmíːL kɔ̀ tàːr woːɗ?
ɗàm-íːL
kɔ̀
tàːr
woːɗ
eat-AP.3S.DJ RECPST\CJ meat\SG.ABS who\SG.ERG
Who ate meat?108
108Here is an unexplained use of the detransitivized verb form in a question. This seems to be
in free variation with the plain verb form in example V.92. Possibly the use of the detransitivized form has to do with the use of an unspecified and therefore non-individuated object ,
which may then result in a less than fully transitive form of the verb.",[386]
"V.3.1 Some further factors affecting Majang clause constructions
A good part of the information that might have fit into this section was already introduced in Part III: Basic Syntax. That section gives a basic introduction and general discussion regarding the case-marking system for central
cases (section III.2), including a consideration of differential ergative marking (DEM) and differential-S marking (section III.2.1.2). It further contains
all relevant information about the sentence-final topicality marker (SFT, section III.4) and the conjoint-disjoint distinction of Majang (section III.3). This
happened in order to provide the context necessary for the understanding of
forms and structures presented in Part IV: Morphology.
Two more factors not introduced in Part III have further effects on the structure of simple clauses in Majang.",[345]
"V.8.1 Coordination
Two clauses of equal grammatical status are combined into a larger sentence
in order to express a closer relationship between the two clauses. As clausecombining conjunctions are almost always used anyway, it would be difficult to distinguish between two sentences following each other and two
clauses forming one sentence, were it not for the rules of placing the sentence-final topicality marker. It was stated in section III.4 that this marker
=ŋ can only appear at the end of a sentence. Therefore, if there is a situation
where the syntactic and pragmatic context would warrant the placing of the
SFT-clitic, but it is not in evidence, then this indicates that the sentence has
not yet reached its end, and at least one more clause follows in the sentence.",[400]

"Tone87Example II.24: verb-tone melodies, as seen on bisyllabic roots21
a) H ɗégér know
b) L ɓàdɛj break
c) LH ràgád prepare[]
[   ]
[]As can be seen here, the noun roots appear to be tonally more varied than the
verb roots, which only come in the three different patterns L, H and LH. The
pattern L occurs 235 times in a 355- item sample of verb stems, H 98 times,
and LH 22 times.
Although all lexical roots are accompanied by lexical tones, some affixes are
underlyingly toneless, and then copy the tone of the preceding syllable (see
section II.6.3).
Based on the available evidence, it is very difficult to decide which of the
two tones is marked or unmarked. The frequency of the tones certainly does
not help in this matter. In the 2879-word text sample, the high tone appears
only slightly more frequently on short vowels (1894 times) than the low tone
(1847 times). On long vowels the frequency differs, though, with 668 high
tones, compared to only 366 low tones. Contour tones are much less frequent, with 55 falling tones (HL) on short vowels balanced by 76 on long
vowels, and 21 rising tones (LH) on short vowels compared to 29 on long
vowels.
In order to read the examples given in this section, it may be necessary to
first understand the tone-orthography conventions used in this study. These
are explained in section II.9.","[92, 93]"
"IV.3.4.2 Tense markers
There are five tense adverbs in Majang, which were interpreted to establish a
metrical tense system by Bender (1983, p. 132f), Unseth (1989b, p. 110) and
Getachew (2014, p. 159ff). These adverbs are ɓàL ‘remote past (REMPST)’,
L
L
kàn ‘medium past (MEDPST)’, kɔ̀ ‘recent past (RECPST)’, kɔ̀ː ‘near future
(NFUT)’ and koj ‘distant future (DFUT)’. These are called tense markers
throughout the present language description, in order to emphasize their different nature compared to the clause-level adverbs seen above.",[312]
"The three examples display the forms of ‘mother’ for a first person (a), second person (b) and third person possessor (c). There is no unpossessed form
of mother in Majang. Example c) further illustrates a second characteristic of
kinship terms: if they are the head of a possessive NP, their possessor nouns
do not use the regular forms of the possessive (-konk or -k), but they use the
dative form. This trait of kinship terms was already carefully described by
Unseth (1992b, p. 99). Other examples of suppletive kinship forms are the
following:
Example IV.98: some other kinship nouns
father
sibling1st person
bàːbɛːL
dèːdéː2nd person
ɓàːɓá
mácóːkòjL3rd person
ɛpɛn
máɲáLIV.2 Verbs
Verbs in Majang are defined by their various syntactic and morphological
properties, which are different for finite and infinite verb forms. All verbs
can be used in a finite form with person marking, and all verbs can also be
used in the negative and infinitive forms, which are not marked for person.
These criteria, however, also apply to words denoting stative property concepts, which morphologically are very similar to verbs. They are thereforeVerbs209treated as a sub-class of verbs in section IV.2.4, where they are called stative
verbs in line with the nomenclature applied to other Surmic languages.
Readers looking for the category of adjectives in Majang are therefore directed to that section.
Finite verbs are characterized by their ability to serve as the predicate of a
clause, without the use of either a copula or a subject pronoun. More about
the use of verbs can be gleaned from sections V.3.2.2 and V.3.3.","[214, 215]"
"78Chapter II.4stead interpreted as sequences of a vowel and an approximant: kùroi
(Bender) vs. kùꜜroj ‘donkey’; wàikùn (Bender) vs. wàjkùn ‘seed’.
In Majang there are many places where the transition from a syllable ending
in a vowel to a syllable beginning with a vowel invites hearing a glide [j] or
[w], depending on the nature of the vowels involved. This study follows the
convention of only writing a glide between vowels if its underlying existence
can be established from additional evidence, like if in a different morphological context the glide is found at the word boundary or in front of a consonant. Thus I write cáːkojɛ ‘valleys’ because of càːkoj ‘valley’, but ɓoɛ
‘antelope’, because in this word, the final /ɛ/ is part of the noun root, and
there is no independent evidence for a glide between the two vowels, besides
the possibility to transcribe this word phonetically as [ ɓojɛ]. The final two
syllables in the two words cáːkojɛ and ɓoɛ are phonetically not easily distinguishable16.
In order to maintain the Majang syllable structure, the language uses a number of devices to break up unacceptable consonant clusters. One of these, involving the presence of alveolar implosives preceding other consonants, is
introduced as rule 3 in section II.5.2. Less specific is a vowel-epenthesis rule
which inserts the default vowel /i/ between stems ending in a [- SONORANT]
consonant and a consonantal suffix or enclitic. A very rough representation
of this rule might look like this:
Rule 1: vowel epenthesisØ→i/C
__ + C
[- SONORANT]This rule is applied for example with the subordinate-clause clitic =k and
with the sentence-final topicality (SFT) clitic =ŋ, which attach themselves
without epenthesis to preceding vowels and most sonorants, but require this
epenthetic vowel in a position following obstruents:16With ɓoɛ a speaker may also choose to separate the two vowels by a glottal stop [ɓoʔɛ].
This glottal stop may in principle be inserted between any two vowels in a word, but most
often it is not (see section II.1.3).","[83, 84]"
