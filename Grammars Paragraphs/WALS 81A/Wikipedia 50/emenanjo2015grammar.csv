"Note the following about the above representation of the sentence: This
sentence dominates the NP, Verb Phrase, Indirect Object, and Adverbial. The
V(erb) dominates both the auxiliary, the main verb and the Complement.
The lexical verb, itself V1, dominates both the Inherent Complement/Direct
Object, the Bound Cognate Noun and the Indirect Object. From the facts
about the internal constituents of the VP, it is clear that the verb is the head
of the entire VP. Indeed, it is the governor of the entire VP. Besides in
meaning-based grammar the verb selects all the elements in both the VP
and all the NPs.
The Igbo Verb
The major distinguishing feature of the Igbo verb is that it is the only part of
speech that takes affixes in the language. Thus, Igbo verbs are subject to
inflectional, derivational and extensional morphology. In addition, the Igbo
verb alone or with its Inherent Complement is a prolific source for the
derivation of a plethora of nouns, nominals and adjectivals of various types
and shapes relevant to both grammaticalization and lexicalization in the
language.
Again, unlike in a good number of languages, the Igbo verb co-exists
obligatorily with a noun or noun phrase complement. This fact calls into
question the relevance of categories like direct object to the grammar, and
the citation form of the verb in the Igbo lexicon and dictionary.
Towards A Multiple Classification of Igbo Verbs
Like nouns and verbs in human language, Igbo verbs belong to a very open
class. In the light of this, therefore, especially in order to enhance a
structured and meaningful discussion, Igbo verbs have to be classified in
discrete classes in terms of their tonal and morphological constituents, as
well as their syntactic, lexical, semantic and pragmatic behaviour.",[449]

Coordination can be marked by one or more coordinators. In (1) – (8)
and (10) marking is by one coordinator. This type of coordination is
sometimes called simply syndetic. In (9) we have three coordinates.
This type of coordination is sometimes called polysyndetic. There is
also asyndetic coordination where there is no coordinator. Indeed, the
nà (and) in (8) can be deleted and the phrase remains grammatical
and acceptable. Whereas in English all the coordinators in a
polysyndetic structure are the same, in Igbo they could be different.
See (Ex. 9).(iii) The Order of Coordinates: Symmetric Vs Asymmetric
Symmetric coordination allows for the free order of coordinates without
much change in grammaticality, acceptability or interpretation. This is
possible in (2) – (6), (8) and (10).
Asymmetrical coordination does not allow for the free order of
coordinates. This is usually so in phraseological structures or lexicalized
expressions involving strict collocation as in:
If the order of coordinator is reversed grammaticality may change
without affecting acceptability and interpretation as in:

"Collocation
Used in lexicology and in semantics, collocation covers the overall study of
the use of vocabulary in language. Collocation refers to the habitual or
normal co-occurrence of individual lexical items in a language. As a feature
of universal grammar, collocation is central to the Language Acquisition
Device (LAD) because it is one, if not the feature that makes language
learning, language teaching and language use possible. Because it is basic
to meaning in language, collocation ties parole to language and is basic to
competence and performance. The principle of collocation results in fixed
structures as it is predicated on lexemes being fixed in their order of cooccurrence as well as in their order of being learnt and used together. OnEmenanjo, Nolue.

object. We shall return to this later, in this chapter.
Nwachukwu (1983; 1985) has put his teeth into the problem of
transitivity in Igbo more than all the practising Igbo grammarians. Finding
‘no syntactic transformation which defines a class of transitive verbs in Igbo,
as is the case in English’ (with… the passive transformation) ‘and (finding
also) that the strictly structural approach does not always work
(Nwachukwu 1983: 103), he resorts to what one can call a semantic –
syntactic congruity argument which enables him to sort different
problematic issues. Significant among Nwachukwu’s points are the
following:
(i)‘Transitive verbs [such as -ri ‘eat’; -gbu ‘kill’, -nu ‘drink’; -ma
‘know’; kèle ‘greet’…] take an NP object drawn from an
unlimited set of nominals within the bounds of co-occurrence
restrictions.(ii)‘Furthermore, there are verbs which involve, at least, two NPs,
the NP subject or agent, and an NP object or goal. In other
words, the action or state denoted by each of these verbs starts
with a subject and ends with an object (‘subject’ and ‘object’
being used here to denote syntactic functions/relations).’(iii)‘… Transitive verbs always express an action or situation
involving, at least, two NPs the direction of the action or
situation of which is immaterial.’Emenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,486A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo(iv)‘Transitive verbs can be two-place predicates like -de ‘write’, -ri
‘eat’, -gbu ‘kill’ or three-place predicates like -nye ‘give’; gwa
‘tell’…’(v)‘Intransitive verbs, unlike transitive verbs, denote actions or
states which begin and end with the NP, as subject. In other
words, the action or state denoted by an intransitive verb does
not involve two NPs in the relation of subject and object.(vi)‘Intransitive verbs are one-place predicates such as:

‘I am wise (intelligent).’(iv)Verbs which tend to take a particular object
Some verbs are used always or almost always with a particular object.
For example, the verb kén ‘bathe’ is always followed by the objectEmenanjo, Nolue.

The verb bèle ‘be in order’ almost always precedes êjít
‘heart’ to mean ‘be happy’. Although the verb ngé ‘be strong’ occurs
alone, when it is followed by lék ‘body’, the meaning ‘try’ is expressed.
(v)Verbs which usually take an object derived from themselves (cognate
object)
Finally, some verbs must always be followed by an object wich is
formed by adding a nominal prefix to the stem from which they
themselves are formed. Such a construction is called a cognate object
construction.
Example:

Indirect objects, the benefactive, ínyí and íjèt
Indirect objects, as well as the objects of actions intended for or for
the benefit of a particular person or persons, are often preceded by the
verb nyí in a serial verb construction. The word íjèt, whose structure
resembles a serialized verb, but which cannot be traced to any
presently existing verb stem, may be used as nyí introducing indirect
objects.
In conclusion, the facts of Obolo suggest that transitivity is not an
‘important’ category in Obolo.

I have always been aware of the morphological and semantic relationships
between these pairs of words. But Onukawa (1994) is the first Igbo
grammarian that I know of, who has drawn attention to their semantics. I
have re-ordered his examples and given new and/or other glosses. If the
relationship between àtù # àtùmàtù, derived by interfixation is anything to
go by, it appears that we are dealing with cases of reduplication. Besides, if
we look at the meaning of the disyllabic forms, they seem to be more basic
or primitive than those of the trisyllabic ones which seem to be all, cases of
expanded, extended or figurative meaning. Again, some of the disyllabic
nouns belong to the basic vocabulary of any culture, which could not have
been borrowed from another language or culture. These words include:
those for parts of the body: head, mouth, shoulder, tail; and words for very
culturally important notions among the Igbo: ‘meeting’, ‘proverb’,
‘reference’. Again, these words could not have been derived by back
formation which, as a process of reverse derivation, results from
deaffixation.",[219]
"On the face of it, the Subject of the S in (12) becomes the
Complement/Object of the S in (13). Whereas in a typical passive voice
situation the Subject is a prepositional phrase introduced by the preposition

Rather than voice (12) and (13) appear to show a relationship of ergativity.
Voice is not a relevant category in Igbo. But Igbo exhibits some
features of ergativity. In a nominative-accusative type of language, such as
English and the Romance languages, the subject of the intransitive verb is
the agent of the transitive. But in an ergative type, the subject of an
intransitive verb is the patient or goal of the transitive verb. The ergative
tendency in Igbo is, however, complicated by the fact that transitivity is not
a necessary phenomenon for classifying Igbo verbs as ALL Igbo verbs are
transitive.
Finally, is ergativity a case in Igbo as it is in Eskimo or a syntactic
type or a (feature for) a class of verbs? See different treatments of ergativity
in Nwachukwu (1976b), and Emenanjo (2006). Ergativity is a phenomenon
that needs urgent research in the Igbo language.",[67]

Indeed the figurative use of language is language creativity at its best. Yet,
the basis of figurative usage is very much the ordinary linguistic knowledge
about words. All competent speakers of a language possess these words and
their semantic properties and their combining powers.
Semantic Roles and Sentence Meaning
Syntax and semantics are different but complementary levels. In the study
of a language, they actually cohere and even collocate. A sentence produces
different readings or interpretations on account of the words and phrases
found in it. The nouns or noun phrases found in a sentence, before a verb,
may have grammatical functions as subject, object or indirect object. But, in
terms of meaning, they may have different semantic roles. Semantic role is a
way of explaining the meaning relationship between (a) noun (phrase) and
the verb of a sentence. Semantic role also refers to the way in which the
referent of the noun/phrase(s) contribute(s) to the action, state or situation
described by a sentence.
In the literature, semantic roles have also been referred to as deep
semantic cases, functional roles, participant roles and, in Chomsykan
linguistics, thematic or theta roles.
Nine different semantic roles have been identified in human language.
These can, however, be collapsed into five groups:

"Notes:
(i)Some dialectal variants are included in parentheses.(ii)Subject forms are those which are used only as subjects of a
sentence. These have also been called ‘subjective forms’. (Adams)
and ‘Independent Pronouns’ (Welmers). Green and Igwe call some
of these, the ‘Inseparable pronouns’.(iii)Object forms are those used in non-subject positions, i.e. as direct

modifiers because syntactically, they modify nouns. Unlike the
subject and object forms, the pronominal modifiers are not nouns
since they cannot be used alone or as head of a two-word nominal
phrase. These pronominal modifiers belong with adjectives,
quantifiers and demonstratives in the form class of adjectivals.
This chapter is not concerned with pronominal modifiers. These
will be better discussed along with the other nominal modifiers, in
the chapter on adjectivization.(v)Pronominal forms can be monosyllabic or disyllabic.(vi)Singular subject forms are dependent or independent. Independent
pronouns, answer the question ‘who?’ alone.",[339]
"Carnochan (1967)
According to Carnochan ‘there is a small number of nominal words which are
distinguished by syntactic and tonal behaviour in the nominal phrase’.
Carnochan does not give a full list of these adjectives but there is reason to
believe that he considered the two deictic elements: à ‘this’; ahù ‘that’; as
well as oma ‘beautiful’; ukwu ‘big’; niīle ‘all’ and dum ‘all’, as adjectives.
As far as tonal behaviour goes, Carnochan observes that ‘the tonal
differences between noun and adjective are illustrated by ihye mma ‘thing
of beauty’ and ihye oma ‘a beautiful thing’. The Class 1 noun in second
place has two high tones in step down relationship while the adjective has
two tones in level relationship’.
We can see from the above excerpt that Carnochan favours the Green
and Igwe, and, the Igwe and Green, approach(es) which treat(s) as an
adjective any lexical item which does not undergo tonal changes when it is
used with a noun.
Abraham (1967)
Abraham (1967) does not say anything about adjectives. It may well be that
he does not think such a class exists in Igbo.
Carrell (1970)
Carrell (1970) holds that there ‘is a great deficiency of descriptive adjectives
in Igbo.’ Although she does not list the very few she regards as adjectives, it
seems that to her nnuku ‘big’ and agadī ‘old’ are adjectives. Carrell, however,
does show in her basic word order typology, the position of the adjective visà-vis those of other elements found in the NP, thus:Emenanjo, Nolue.

number of words to be treated as adjectives, notably those found in the

they can never be used after this verb.

ADJECTIVIZATION
What is Adjectivization?
Adjectivization is one of the universal processes in human language. It
involves the use of adjectivals or nominal modifiers to ‘qualify’ nouns. What
constitute the adjectivals in Igbo? Does Igbo have adjectives?
Adjectives in Igbo: A Brief Historical Overview
The very existence, characteristics and exact number of adjectives, in Igbo,
are likely to remain among the moot areas of Igbo language studies. In the
available literature, there appears to be two clear-cut views on the subject of
Igbo adjectives. One view holds that Igbo ‘teems with adjectives of various
morphological classes’. Thomas (1913), Igwe (1974), and Okonkwo (1974)
belong here. The other view holds that Igbo has really very few adjectives,
possibly not more than eight. Adams (1932), Ward (1936), Green and Igwe
(1963), Igwe and Green (1964), Carnochan (1967) Carrell (1970), Welmers
and Welmers (1969), Ogbalu (1962; 1972), Emenanjo (1972; 1973; 1975(a);
1978) belong together here.
In chronological order, the first analyst whose view on Igbo adjectives
is available to us is Thomas (1913).","[375, 376]"

Indeed, Onukawa (1999b) is a very well thought out study which should be
taken into consideration in any classification of ESS and especially so with
regard to their co-occurrence potentials in an (extended) verbal extension
collocation.
(e) The Order of Co-occurrence of ESS
This will remain one of the most problematic issues in Igbo linguistics for a
very long time. Emenanjo (1978), Onukawa (1999b), Onumajuru (2008)
contain some attempts on the issue, with varying depths of analysis. For
now, Onukawa (1999b) is possibly the most ambitious attempt at theEmenanjo, Nolue.

One problem I have with his approach, however, is that he uses
numbers instead of labels. I think labels are more mnemonie than simple
numbers.

extension which we have worked out. This structure provides for verb root(s)

unpulished and published materials on the issue (Emenanjo 1978, 2011),
Onukawa (1999b), Uchechukwu (2011(a)) with regard to labels and the
entire structure.
Since human language is structured (i.e. governed by rules), there certainly
must be some underlying rules governing the co-occurrence of verbs, clitics
and ESS, as groups, sub-groups and individual members of sub-groups.
These rules include:

"Grammatical Categories Relevant to the Igbo Verb
Most modern linguistic analyses of Igbo have thrown up the following
concerning the grammatical categories relevant in the Igbo verbal system.
(i)Tense, is a significant category, marked by auxiliaries, inflectional
affixes, especially suffixes, and tonal morphemes, (Nwachukwu;
1976), Oji (1984), Igwe (1975), Emenanjo (1985;1991),(ii)Aspect, is a significant category, also marked by auxiliaries,
inflectional affixes, especially suffixes, and tonal morphemes,
(Emenanjo, 1985;1991),(iii)Negation, both standard and non-standard, as a significant
category marked by negative (auxiliary) verbs, inflectional affixes,
especially suffixes, and tonal morphemes, (Emenanjo, 1985),(iv)Mood as a significant category marked by prefixes, tonal
morphemes, modal verbs, and periphrasis (Nwachukwu, (1980),
Igwe, L.O. (1987), Williamson (1980).(v)Ergativity is a potential category that is necessary in the syntaxsemantics of Igbo and in the classification of verbs in terms of
complementation. Nwachukwu (1977), Emenanjo (2005, 2011),
Manfredi (1987), Mbah (2005) and Benjamin .I. Mmadike, (personal
communication)(vi)Voice is not a significant category.(vii)Case is a ‘deep’ category that is marked in the verbal and nominal
classes. Case is clearly marked in pronouns as we have hinted in
chapters 1 and 2. With nouns, case is marked by word order and
tonal morphemes. For example, the common genitive and the
genitive of personification are marked by tone patterns in the
associative and the specific constructions, respectively. With verbs,Emenanjo, Nolue.

ProQuest Ebook Central,446A Grammar of Contemporary Igbocase is marked on the verbs by ESS as we have shown in chapter
8. The marking of cases, their number and their types, in Igbo, are
unlike in Latin and Greek but much more like those found in the
Finno-Ugric languages. Indeed, the very strict and mandatory
collocational restrictions between nouns and verbs in Igbo
predisposes the language to a case grammar analysis. Uwalaka
(1988), a semantico-syntactic analysis of the Igbo verb, is very
much a case grammar, ‘the first attempt at a systematic
classification of Igbo verbs (and syntactic analysis) based on
semantic and syntactic evidence.’ Follow up studies are eagerly and
sincerely awaited on modern versions of case functional or
cognitive grammar.

Time: Lexicalization and Grammaticalization
Time is an unlimited and limitless continuum, from creation to eternity. It is
a reality fashioned by man to put order on actions, states and events and to
give meaning to life and existence. It can be classified, computed and
measured in different ways, with different criteria, sometimes
complementary, sometimes contrastive. Every culture or people, simple or
complex, pre-literate or literate, has its own yardsticks and devices for
computing, measuring or demarcating time. In the Judeo – Christian
culture, the Creator himself provides some of the yardsticks or signposts for
identifying time (in Genesis 1:1-31) Sun, Day, Night, Moon, Stars, Seasons.
Time belongs to arealis. In this regard, time can be measured,

Igbo has been a literary language since 1841. In chronological order and as
we partially showed in Emenanjo (1985: 36-41), grammatical analyses
relevant to tense and related matters in Igbo date back to Schön (1861),
through Spencer (1921), Adams (1932), Kelley (1954), Swift et al. (1962),
Green and Igwe (1963), Igwe and Green (1964), Abraham (1967), Welmers

As would be expected, a good number of the earlier studies which are
written (not necessarily in chronological order) without the benefit of modern
linguistic exposure and insights, saw and treated ‘tenses’ in Igbo from the
standpoint of traditional grammar and its terminology. In such studies,
present, past and future, as well as present continuous (habitual), future
continuous, imperfect, perfect and, even, pluperfect tenses were set up in
Okonkwo (1974: 27-44) and even Oluikpe (1978). These were copiously
illustrated with their markers but with little regard to the place of tones! In
all these studies, therefore, other than negation and mood, tense is the other
significant verbal category. Mention should be made, however, of Spencer
(1892) (revised by T.J. Dennis (1915)) who, used “tense”, because “aspect”
was then unknown.","[482, 483]"

But the way they are encoded in syntax is language-specific. The syntacticsemantic class of the verb determines the selectional restrictions of these in
the deep syntax and semantics of each individual verb.
Argument Structure
Argument is used in predicate calculus and, very often, in semantic theory
to refer to the relationship of a name or other term to the predicate with
which it combines to form a simple positive. Used fairly differently, in case
grammar, generative grammar and GB, an argument simply puts together
the various NPs that occur with a verb. Argument structure therefore refersEmenanjo, Nolue.

M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited. All rights reserved.thus to the various NPs that occur with particular verbs which are called
their arguments. For example, intransitive verbs take a subject NP only
while transitive verbs take both one subject NP and direct object NP. It is,
however, not all nominals or NPs in a sentence that are arguments of the
verb and are to be specified in verbal theta-grids in the lexicon. Only
participant roles qualify as arguments while non-participant roles do not
qualify. Non-participant roles are adjuncts which give extra information
about the context in terms of the time, location, purpose or result of the
event. See Radford (1988), and Haegeman (1994) for discussions of the
grammatical status of arguments and adjuncts. In terms of verbal
behaviour, the argument structure strongly reveals some deep relationships
between syntax and semantics via thematic roles. Thematic roles are not
assigned to arguments randomly. There is a strong underlying semanticsyntactic connection between the meaning of the verb and the syntactic
structure of sentences containing any given verb. For any competent native
speaker, his knowledge of verbs includes the syntactic category, the
arguments they select, and the thematic roles they assign to the arguments.
Indeed, the argument structure of a verb is part of its meaning and is
included in the lexical entry. Whereas in English, transitivity is one such
fact of verbs, in Igbo it is complementation. The Igbo verb and its
complement (or argument) constitute what Emenanjo (1975) has called ‘a
verbal complex’. This, by itself, is a lexeme which has to be entered in the
Igbo lexicon as one lexical unit.","[632, 633]"
"The three quotations above imply that:
(i)Igbo grammar should be analyzed and discussed only in accordance
with the facts of the Igbo language and not in accordance with the
facts of any other language whether Indo-European, Nigerian or
African.(ii)The Igbo language should NOT be analyzed as if it were English or any
other Indo-European language with which many Igbo people are
conversant. Analysts should not expect that all important lexical or
grammatical categories or the numbers or members of each of these
categories as they are found in English or any other language must be
found in Igbo.(iii)Analysts should not rely on English glosses (or translations) while
analyzing issues in Igbo grammar like setting up grammatical
categories because as Emenanjo (1984: 35) states “this can be
hopelessly deceptive and misleading”. Put differently, the semantic
nuances expressed by a free or bound form do not exclusively
determine its word class. In fact, analysts should not allow themselves
to be misdirected by semantic considerations in situations where
formal and morphosyntactic considerations should predominate.(iv)Analysts should endeavour to consult and use the recent available

"In this regard, Igbo resembles the Finno-Ugric languages which have a lot
more cases than are not found in the classical languages.

"Fixed Phraseology
In 18(b), the structure is fixed. So too are the internal constituents of the
phrase. This is a typical case of fixed collocation involving strict selectional
restrictions. Fixed collocations with fixed internal constituents are seen in
formula-like phenomena found in folklore and paramielogy, in general, and
phraseology, in particular. Phraseology is an approach to linguistics which
deals with all kinds of ready-made and regular combination of words which
manifest in formulaic and phrasal collocations. Phraseology deals with
linguistic expressions and utterances which are manifest in:
x ilu:
proverbs; sayings, maxims, truisms, aphoristic quotations

(i)they are all cases of special phraseological units which may be
phrases or more.(ii)they are all fixed, not adhoc expressions or stretches of language.
They are normal, regular, fixed, frozen, prefabricated and preformulated combinations of words that appear like formulas.(iii) their internal constituents are unchangeable and their order is
irreversible.
(iv) unlike in cases of free collocation, where no mutual expectancy exists
between the constituents, in fixed collocation items are often mutually
predictable, irrespective of context of usage, interest, personality or
status of users.
(v)they are used for traditional observations or statements that are
culture-bound and context-sensitive.(vi) these expressions, which are unalternable in structure, style and
meaning, have their meanings, hidden associations and allusions only
discernible to those versed in the language, its deep lexicon, and its
culture.
(vii) on account of their fixed constituents, fixed structures and fixed
meanings, each set is essentially a lexeme that is to be entered as one
word in the dictionary.

necessitated by context and so are utterances rather than sentences.","[648, 649]"

people and with such interdependence that one member of the pair
presupposes the other member. Indeed, relational pairs can be conversives
or reversives. As conversives, they express contractual relationships. In
contractual relationships if one assumes one, the other entails its converse.
As reversives, if one party engages in one, he/she leaves or gives up the
other.

In addition to showing binary contrasts or opposition, antonymy can be
non-binary. In order words, instead of two words, it concerns many words in
the same semantic field, each with its own particular distinguishing
characteristics as well as the same point of affinity or kinship in meaning.
Non-binary synonyms operate the principle of contrast within similarity. A
non-binary contrast can be either serial or cyclic.
Serial Non-Binary Contrast
This shows the relationship between three or more words or lexemes which
are capable of being arranged serially from the highest to the lowest member
in the series, or vice versa. Numerals, the scalar rating by examiners, and
the hierarchical ranking in the military or religious orders, are examples of
serial non-binary contrast as in:Emenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,588A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo21(a) 0 1 2 3 4 - - - (b) A+, A, B+, B, C+, C, D, E, F

This shows the relationship between three or more other words or lexical
items which are capable of being arranged in the manner of a continuum or
a cycle. The days of the week and the months of the year constitute a cycle
each. So, too, the colour spectrum. Each of the days of the week or the
months of the year or the colours in the spectrum, has its own meaning
which is in contrast to, in opposition of, and incompatible with its many

Denotation And Connotation
This pair of terms is used in lexical semantics, literary theory, computer
science, media studies, logic and semiotics, with differing but overlapping
meanings. In semiotics, denotation is the literal or surface meaning of the
signifier. In media studies, it is the first level of the analysis of a text. It is
the literal meaning that what is seen on a page of text, yields. It is meaning
that is neither metaphorical nor figurative. In logic, it is synonymous with
extension or the intrinsic meaning or reference. In syntax and semantics,
literary theory, and linguistic stylistics, it is a meaning that can be pinned
down with reasonable precision because it is the basic, literal, lexical and
that of dictionary meaning. Denotational meaning is thus the linguistic
meaning of an element, word, expression or phraseological unit. The animal
ewu ‘goat’ can have the denotational meaning of ‘a four-legged, hairy,
domestic animal that feeds on yams and selected grasses and leaves’.
Connotation, on the other hand, is the opposite or antonym of
denotation in computer science, media studies logic, semiotics, syntax,
semantics, literary theory and stylistics. In media studies, it is the meaning
at the applied, metaphorical or figurative level of analysis. In logic andEmenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo589philosophical linguistics, it is understood as intension and sense. In syntax
and semantics, literary theory, and stylistics, it is the meaning that is
contextual, text-bound, culture-bound and subjective. It is the literal or
dictionary meaning influenced by extra-linguistic factors. This meaning is
thus figurative, applied and metaphorical, according to time-space
considerations. See figure XIX and notice that connotative meaning
corresponds to all of social, affective, thematic and utterance meanings. In
Igbo, for example, in addition to the word or lexeme’s, dictionary meaning
the animal ‘ewu’ ‘goat’, in the culture, is associated, non-linguistically, with
lasciviousness and stupidity.
Put simply, denotation and connotation imply reference and sense
respectively in logic, and non-figurative and figurative meaning in semantics
and literary stylistics.
Denotation limits the meaning or definition of an element, word or
expression to its literal (or dictionary) meaning (as applicable). Connotation,
on the other hand, expands or extends the literal meaning to include all the
associations, feelings, thoughts impressions, emotional suggestions,
personal or group attitudes, view points and mindsets. Denotation is intralinguistic, connotation is extra-linguistic.
In human language, sometimes, two or more words have the same or
almost the same denotation or definition, but have very different
connotations. See

"The Igbo noun cannot be inflected for number, gender, person or case.
Nwachukwu (1983) has referred to Igbo as a verb language because of
the centrality of the Igbo verb to derivational, extensional and inflectional
morphology in the language. The Igbo language can also be justifiably called
a ‘noun’ language because it is the Igbo noun or nominal that functions
semantically as adverb(ial)s and adjective(als) in the language. For, with the
exception of a few free adjectives and no adverbs, nouns and nominals, as
free words, perform, through lexicalization, the function of adjectives,
adjectivals, adverbs and adverbials. Indeed, a lexical classification of Igbo
nouns will throw up sub-classes of nouns that can be called adjectival and
adverbial nouns. In terms of their ability to function as minimal NPs, heads
of NPs, and their lexical implicatures, Igbo nominals can be sub-classified
into:
(a)
(b)
(c)
(d)nouns
numerals and numbers
interrogatives
pronounsDetails of these can be found in Emenanjo (1978).

Like verbs, nouns belong to an open class. For analytical purposes,

(d)Proper nouns
Common nouns
Qualifactive nouns

(i)The nouns in this class have the characteristic that they can be used

institutions and concepts.","[314, 315]"
"Welmers and Welmers (1968)
Welmers and Welmers (1968) hold that ‘there is a small group of words
which can properly be called ‘adjectives. To be exact, there are exactly eight
adjectives in Igbo’, constituting four pairs of autonyms. These, as they are
used after nouns, are as follows:
oma‘good’ukwu‘big’ojoo‘bad’ntà‘small’ojiī‘black’, ‘dark’ohuru‘new’ocha‘white’, light’ocyè‘old’All these words have the characteristic that they do not undergo that ‘tonal
alternation’ which is characteristic of nouns in the associative construction.
This is the touchstone for defining three of the Welmers and Welmers
adjectives notably oma ‘good’; ocha ‘white’; and ukwu ‘big’.
But not for ojiī ‘black’, ojoo ‘bad’ (and ohuru ‘new’). For when these
are used after nouns, they would not be affected by the morphotonemic
alternation found in the associative construction. Put in other words, what
Welmers and Welmers are saying is that these two words cannot be
identified as adjectives in the same way as oma, ocha and ukwu, since we
have no way of verifying whether ojiī and ojoo would have undergone the
usual tonal changes in the associative construction. In the case of these two
words, therefore, Welmers and Welmers use the criterion of ‘the parallelismEmenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,349A Grammar of Contemporary IgboCopyright © 2015. M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited. All rights reserved.of their use after nouns and the use of related forms (òji ‘blackness’; njo
‘badness’) as nouns after a verb’.
This then leaves us with the three other words: ntà ‘small’, ohuru
‘new’ and ocyè ‘old’. These three have inherent tones which do not permit
diagnosis of them as adjectives on the basis of comparison with nouns in
the associative construction. Rather, their use immediately after nouns,
paralleled by the use of an identical form – a homophonous noun – after a
verb establishes them as adjectives by analogy with the use of ukwu which
cannot be anything other than an adjective in its use after a noun. This
criterion is what Welmers and Welmers call the use of ‘category
membership’. Elsewhere, this is described thus: ‘when these are used with a
noun they have the implication that such a noun is a member of a category
or type which is ‘new’, ‘small’, ‘old’ and so on. ‘For example, ugbo ohuru is
not simply a car which has never been used, the implication is that the car
is specifically the latest model. Similarly, efere ntà is not simply a plate or
dish which is small by comparison with others, it is rather a dish of a smallsized type, perhaps, specifically, a salad plate or saucer’.
Three things are note-worthy about the Welmers and Welmers
analysis:
(i)their adjectives form a ‘small, remarkably symmetrical and
semantically unique morphological class’(ii)the diagnostic criterion – the associative construction – crucial for
these eight words does not happen to be applicable to all these
words(iii)because of (ii) above, there is a resort to another criterion –
‘analogies in usage and semantic features’ – in order to be able to
account for the inclusion of some of those words as adjectives.","[383, 384]"
"Syntactic Behaviour
The term pronoun henceforth will be restricted to the subject and object
forms.",[341]
"For this reason, there is no syntactic need to recognize a class of intransitive
verbs as distinct from transitive verbs in the language. Awobuluyi, therefore,
does not talk of verbs being transitive or intransitive, but rather of their
taking or not taking objects, depending upon the context. With regard to
verbs, objects and pragmatics in Yoruba, the following have been identified.

"Verbs and objects in Obolo
According to Faraclas (1984:51-54) the distinction between verbs that may
take objects and verbs that may not take objects in Obolo is not as
important as the distinction between verbs that MUST take objects and
those that need not take objects or which may occur alone with the objects
understood. From the point of view of verbs and objects in Obolo, the
following have been observed.
(a)Verbs which must take objects versus verbs which occur without objects
(i)
Tone and verbs that must take an object
In certain situations, verbs of the same tone class will carry slightly
different tones because one must take an object while the other need
not take an object.
For example, let us consider the two CVVC high-toned verbs
kàan ‘have’ and láak ‘sleep’. Since stress is assigned to all MEAINGFUL
sentences in Obolo, any COMPLETE command carries stress. Stress
usually causes high tone to become high-low tone, so that, láak ‘sleep’
becomes láàk! ‘sleep!’ káan, however, never becomes *káàn. This isEmenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,496A Grammar of Contemporary Igbobecause, while láak may be used alone in a command, káan must be
followed by an object to form a complete sentence; thus, it is never
pronounced *káàn, but rather káán in isolation, where the verb is
usually in the imperative:
The CVCV verbs chíli ‘open’ and sába ‘cross’ are another case in
point. While chili alone can mean ‘open it!’ with an implied object,
sába can never be used alone with an implied object, so it never
carries a high-low tone pattern in isolation. Verbs like sába require
objects denoting particular entities or generic terms like mkpó ‘thing’,
or ínû ‘thing’, etc. Examples:

Our study has a number of implications both for Igbo and for general
linguistics:
(i)The most consistent classification of Igbo verbs is in accordance
with the various language-specific types of complements they
require in underlying structure.(ii)All complements are constituents of the category Verb, but
Objects (whether direct or indirect) are constituents of the VP.
In this we agree with Nwachukwu.","[536, 537]"
"The Arguments for Transitivity in Igbo
Ubahakwe (1976), Uwalaka (1983) and Nwachukwu (1983; 1984), Ihionu
(1992), Mbah (1999, 2011), Manfredi (2011), Ezenwafor (2011), Okeke
(2011), Ikegwuonu (2011), Mmadike (2011) etc. have argued that transitivity
is an essential category in the Igbo VP.
According to Ubahakwe (1976: 45-56), Emenanjo’s “assertion (against
transitivity) seems to rest on the following contentions. First, he rejects the
very basis of the traditional distinction between transitivity and intransitivity
– namely, the presence or absence of an “object”, since as he argues, both
transitive and intransitive verbs take “objects”. Secondly, he contends that
all Igbo verbs have a nominal cognate element which complements the verb
and that the cognate element is, invariably, an object in function”.
Ubahakwe notices two major problems with these assertions. The first
is one of terminology. Whereas for Emenanjo ‘object’ in Igbo is defined in
purely structural terms and not tied to transitivity”, for Ubahakwe theEmenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,484A Grammar of Contemporary IgboCopyright © 2015. M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited. All rights reserved.concepts of ‘object’ and ‘transitivity’ are interdependent and are defined in
semantic (not structural) terms.
The second problem is connected with the claim that intransitivity is a
surface structure phenomenon and that all Igbo verbs are transitive. This
follows directly from the assumption that all the nominal cognate elements
are ‘objects’ in function. My contention is that the transitive and intransitive
dichotomy exists both at the surface and deep structure levels in Igbo and
that their realizations are, in fact, clearer in deep structure (where he thinks
the difference disappear) than at the surface structure (where he believes
the differences only exist.)
The crux of Ubahakwe’s critique of Emenanjo (1975b) is that
‘Emenanjo’s structural definition of ‘object’ makes no functional distinction
between direct and indirect object. But such a distinction is crucial
towards the identification of transitive and intransitive functions of a verb! It
is important to point out that in Igbo, verbs are not rigidly classified as
transitive and intransitive. The classification depends on usage. The ‘same’
word (verb) may be transitive in one context, and intransitive in another, as
illustrated with the two sentences following:
(7)Òkeeke jèrè ìjè (transitive)
Okeke went on a walk(8)Òkeeke jèrè Kanò (intransitive)
Okeke went to KanoNwachukwu’s critique of both Emenanjo (1975b) and Ubahakwe (1976) has
this to say of Ubahakwe’s views summarized above. ‘Ubahakwe… finds fault
with Emenanjo’s analysis; this fault he traces to a rather heavy reliance on a
purely structural definition of transitivity. Rather, it seems that the term
“object” has not been defined in the correct structural terms. An object is
that NP which is directly dominated, in deep structure, by the node VP; thus
an object, whether direct or indirect is a VP constituent.’ (Nwachukwu 1983:
115-6)
Uwalaka (1983: 7-15), after disagreeing with aspects of Emenanjo
(1975b), posits the pronominilization test for direct objects and transitive
verbs. If an NP can be replaced by a pronoun, and be used, unlike the
indirect object, as the only complement in a sentence, then that NP is the
direct and its verb is transitive.","[518, 519]"

ProQuest Ebook Central,138A Grammar of Contemporary IgboCertainly the distortions in tones have something to contribute to the
rhythm and movement of these songs. We really need a transdisciplinary
team of musicologists, phonologists, grammarians and semanticists to
unravel all the underlying currents and manifestations of tonal distortion in
lyrical tones.
With particular reference to tonal notation, if we do not mark tones in
the above songs we won’t be able to appreciate fully what happens when the
lexical tone mgbè becomes the lyrical tone mgbe; or when the lexical tones
of Ìgbòuzò become Igbouzo and Ìgbòùzò, etc.
Finally, what we are saying and emphasizing about tone marking is
that even if it is possible to dispense with tone marks and tone marking in
narratives, we cannot and should not dispense with these in non-prose
texts. We cannot and must not dispense with these in non-prose texts like
proverbs, riddles, tonal puns, verses-traditional and modern – and songs,
traditional and non-traditional. Tones ought to be fully even if economically
marked, for.
The marks will prevent the staccato pace of reading which
characterizes many a reading of Igbo passages. We find that in real life
situations people work from the English translation to the Igbo version
in order to put the correct tones on the words and phrases. If there
were tone marks, the reverse would be the case.(ii)If the principle of allowing dialect words into creative works word lists,
metalanguage and dictionaries is accepted, then a good deal of the
dialect words, idioms and phrases will have to be fully tone-marked if
they are to be pronounced correctly and are to be meaningful.","[172, 173]"

Adverbials and their Meanings/Functions
In terms of their meanings/functions in general linguistic theory Thomason
and Martinet (1976; 1980), recognize eight classes of adverbs, Pyks and
Aiegeo (1988: 187) four sub-classes, Bartsch (1976) eight sub-categories;
and Shopen (1985) twelve, namely: time, location, manner, purpose, reason,
circumstantial, spontaneous, conditionally, concessive, substitutive, addition
and absolutive’. With particular reference to Igbo, Oluikpe (1978) classifies
Igbo adverbials into four major groups: time, place, manner and reason. In
terms of adverbial clauses, Ezejideaku (1989) identifies six ‘simple’
adverbials: manner, time, place (locational) conditional, reason and purpose
and three combination types, two, within time manner adverbials, with time
adverbials, manner adverbials with place adverbials. On our own, with
respect to the meanings/functions, we identify twelve classes of adverbials.
These can be expressed by the various types of adverbials marked by nouns,
NPs, PPs, extensional suffixes and adverbial clauses. In alphabetical order
these twelve adverbials are: cause, condition, concession, degree, emphasis,
manner, means, place, purpose, reason, (and) time.","[416, 417]"
"Case

traditional grammar, the relationship between nouns, pronouns and
adjectives in terms of:
Nominative, the case of the Subject
Vocative
Addressee
Accusative
Objective

Possession
Dative

Latin is among the languages with the most developed and most complex

pronouns and adjectives were declined (and verbs conjugated) for
inflectional categories of case and number.",[63]

transitivity in Igbo concluded that ‘all Igbo verbs are indeed transitive:
For, the concept of transitivity is shifting from its original
understanding as a surface structure relation. Currently
evidence from linguistics and related disciplines point to the
fact that transitivity is a relation of a union and intersection
rather than that of affectedness of actions proceeding from the
agent to the complement… Cross linguistic evidence shows that
languages subcategorize complements in different ways. Some
languages use object-internal verbs to express concepts, which
other languages would use phrases to express. The Igbo
language belongs to the latter. Indeed, all verbs in the language
subcategorize complements in their underlying structure. This
makes verbs in other languages especially English which would
appear as intransitive co-occur with complements that are
either inherent or bound in the Igbo language.","[527, 528]"

ADVERBIALIZATION
What is Adverbialization?
Like adjectivization, adverbialization is a lexical or notional process which
involves the modification of a primary category. Adjectivals are to adjectives
what adverbials are to adverbs. Whereas adjectives and adverbs belong to
the primary categories of grammar, adjectivals and adverbials belong to the
tertiary category of words whose function is to modify other categories (Haris
1978: 229). Like adjectives, adverbs are essentially modifiers of nouns, noun
phrases and verbs. Like adjectives, adverbs are free forms with grammatical
behaviour peculiar to them in their discrete class of the primary categories
or parts of speech. Whereas in the well-described Indo-European languages,
adjectives and adverbs appear to be universals, in African languages, they
appear to be language-specific. But even in English (as perhaps in other
Indo-European languages), Crystal (1971: 75) refers to adverbs as a ‘dust
bin class… for words without classes of their own’.
If you don’t know what part of speech a word
belongs to, call it an adverb.","[397, 398]"
"Emenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo609Deixis As A Semantic Notion
The above discussions show that deixis is both a grammatical and a
semantic notion. Personal, spatial and temporal deixis share a basic point of
reference: the speaker’s identity and location in time and space. Deixis can,
however be grammaticalized and lexicalized, i.e. through both function
words/morphemes like demonstratives or pronouns or affixes, or words like
here and there. In Igbo, as in all languages, there is considerable overlap
among the different types of deixis. For example, the demonstratives can be
used to mark more than one deixis, as in:
nwata à
ihe à
ùtutu à‘this child’ (personal deixis)
‘this thing’ (spatial deixis)
‘this morning’ (temporal deixis)Finally, because deixis is a semantic notion, we find that the three basic
types of deixis illustrate how semantic notions permeate syntax and human
language beyond the simple lexical meaning of words. This is because deixis
brings in utterance meaning into language use. All of these happen because
language is essentially a vector for communication beyond the lexical and
sentence or utterance meaning.
Holophrases
Holophrases are one-word verbless sentences or ontological statements.
These do not have any of the identifiable sentence elements. They have no
nuclei or margins, no NPs or verbs, and thus cannot participate at all in
clause structure. Nevertheless, they carry in themselves the syntactic values
of whole nuclei or sentences or utterances.
Holophrases can be sub-divided further in accordance with the
inherent lexical content of the respective words, thus:

SOME TYPES OF IGBO SENTENCES
Towards a Typology of Sentences in Human Language
The sentence can be, and, indeed, has been defined in different ways. Some
of these definitions are:
(i)a complete expression of a number of words with a finite verb, capable
of standing alone(ii)the highest level of elements in (the study of) syntax(iii)the smallest unit of elements in discourse and human communication(iv)a sequence of well selected syntactic items combined into a
grammatically correct and acceptable unit in accordance with certain
rules, and patterns of arrangement, inherent modification and
cohesion, and tone and/or intonation, in any given language.","[565, 566]"
"Semantic Features and Linguistic Meaning
These are features of words in lexical meaning. They are the basic and
inherent elements which distinguish words, especially, those that share
kinship of sorts. For example, the semantic features of father include,
parent and male. One of these features is shared with mother and the
other with man (generic), as in:
father (nnà)mother (nnè)+ mmadù (+human)+ mmadù (+ human)+ oke (adult)+ oke (adult)+ nnà (father)+ nnè (mother)The semantic features of nnà (father) and nne (mother) show that both differ
only essentially on the basis of sex, as a biological factor. Otherwise, they
share both oke (maturity) and mmadù (person), generically. Semantic
features derive from the componential theory of meaning and its emphasis
on the binary opposites of ‘+’ and ‘-’ features. Thus mother, nne, is thus: [nnà] i.e. – father. For more on Componentical Analysis, see Lyons (1995),
Liehrer (1974) and Ndimele (1999).
Selectional Restriction(s) and Linguistic Meaning
This is, sometimes, called a feature or even a law in generative
transformational grammar from which it came into semantics. SelectionalEmenanjo, Nolue. A Grammar of Contemporary Igbo : Constituents, Features and Processes, M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited, 2015. ProQuest Ebook Central,558A Grammar of Contemporary IgboCopyright © 2015. M & J Grand Orbit Communications Limited. All rights reserved.restrictions constitute the inherent features which specify the restrictions on
the combination permissible of lexical items within a given grammatical
context. Thus, the verb: -ta ‘chew’ has the features of a N(P) as subject, and
this is [+animate], and an obligatory complement which has the feature
[+ ATAMATA] ‘CHEWABLE’. Simplified, this means that the verb ‘chew’, in
Igbo, inherently requires as its subject something that is animate i.e.
animals and humans. It also requires as its inherent and mandatory
complement a noun (phrase) that is patently chewable. On its part, the verb
-lu ‘marry’ requires, for its selectonal restrictions, a noun with the feature [+
human] and an inherent complement with the feature [+ human]. For, it is
only human beings, that marry or are given in marriage. As with semantic
features, it is the significant or definitive features that are marked in
selectional restrictions. A [+human] subsumes animacy, but a [+ animate]
needs [+ human]. Otherwise, it could be interpreted as just an animal.
Content and Function Words
The lexicon or dictionary/thesaurus of Igbo, like other human languages,
contains essentially two complementary sets of words: content and function.
Content words are those with lexical, independent, denotative and
referential meanings. To this class belong verbs, nouns, numerals,
ideophones, adjectivals and adverbials. Given their very large and indefinite
numbers, as well as their potentials to generate new words, content words
are said to belong to an open class.
Function words, on the other hand, have meanings but not lexically
independent, denotative or referential meanings. Their meanings are only
realized in relation to other words in a phrase, sentence or utterance with
relevance to their functions in structures. Given their rather small and finite
numbers and their lack of the capacity to generate new ones, function words
are said to belong to a closed class. Function words have meanings. But
these belong more to the grammatical than to the semantic component,
where they are analyzed, defined and classified. Function words in Igbo are
markers of:
xgrammatical categories: case, person and number in pronouns, tense,
aspect, negation and mood in verbsxinflectional morphology: auxiliaries, inflectional affixes and tonexextensional morphology: extensional affixesxderivational morphology: derivational affixesEmenanjo, Nolue.

"This book really set out originally as a revision of Elements of Modern Igbo Grammar. Between
1978 when Elements was first published, and now, a lot has happened in Igbo Language studies
in general, and Igbo grammar, in particular. In 1978, there were very few scholars in Igbo linguistic
studies. Most of the available studies then were in the mould of traditional grammar. Today, there
are not less than three dozen scholars in all aspects of Igbo linguistic studies, parading different
theoretical orientations. Sophisticated studies of various aspects of Igbo(id) grammar (and
lexicography) are now available in some of the theoretical frameworks popular since Syntactic

Oweleke, Vicky Onumajuru, B.M. Mmadike, Amaechi Oha. This number, given in no order,
constitutes only a sample. As one of the pioneers in Igbo linguistic studies, I am very familiar with
this turf as a teacher, researcher, facilitator and “assessor”. Indeed, I came into Igbo linguistics
studies at a time when traditional grammar was dominant. So, one of the first things I did following
Kay Williamson, William Welmers, William Welmers and B. Welmers and Margaret M. Green,
M.M. Green and G. Egemba Igwe, Egemba Igwe and M.M. Green among others was to point out
what Igbo grammar really is and should be. We also pointed out what are or should be the formal
characteristics of Igbo nouns, ideophones, nominal modifiers, adjectives among other nominal
modifiers, pronouns (1977), suffixes and enclitics, verbs and verbals. Indeed, with Welmers and
Welmers, Green and Igwe, Williamson, as our guides, we are among the second batch of the
first generation native Igbo linguists. When I look back over some four decades from 1969 when
I began my own studies in Igbo grammar there is really a lot to celebrate about, in the human
and material resources now available in Igbo linguistic and literary studies.
Title of the Book
The title of this book is in two parts: the main and the sub. The main title emphasizes the article
‘A’ which suggests that the work is just one approach, my own approach or orientation.
Contemporary suggests the variety of Igbo which the book looks at in both time and space, and
in Igboid linguistics. The word contemporary enables us to reach out to and include data,
examples and even counter-examples from across Igboland, in the seven states where Igbospeaking live. Contemporary Igbo goes beyond Central Igbo, (Ward), Modern Igbo Neo-Central
Igbo, and Standard Igbo (Emenanjo). Our contemporary Igbo is, indeed, fairly synonymous with
Neo-Central Igbo (Emenanjo). Put differently, contemporary Igbo is Standard Igbo with currentEmenanjo, Nolue.

ProQuest Ebook Central,viigeo-historical realities, a pan-Igbo substratum, and an inclusive and holistic mindset about
Igboness, in language matters.
The subtitle of this book is a mouthful. But we need it to capture all the phenomena
emphasized in the work. Features covers phonological, morphological, syntactic, semantic and
pragmatic ones. Constituents is a cover-term for phonological, morphological, grammatical, and
semantic categories and structures. Processes is used to cover phonological, morphological,
morpho-syntactic, syntactic and semantic operations, as well as both lexicalization and
grammatical. Finally, the use of the word processes, enables us to refer to, among others,
matters like adjectivization and adverbialization rather than adjectives and adverbs, and
aktionserten in addition to aspect. ‘Pure’ adjectives and prepositions are very few in Igbo, and
adverbs non-existent. But the language, like all languages, has strategies of lexicalization for
handling adjectival, prepositional and adverbial notions.","[7, 8]"
