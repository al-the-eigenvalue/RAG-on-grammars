and this construction can be reconstructed back to P-X. Such a verb is P-X *kare ‘want’ (N1ti, W1 karé, W2 kalé, K kéré, SE-!Xun *kare or *4ré), which usually takes the object beforegame1970: 127, Kohler 1973: 63, Heikkinen 1987: 49f., Heine & KGnig 2004), e.g.,[Shm.

means but have to be derived from the semantic context of the utterance. This is particularly
obvious in the case of a number of verbs that allow for a reversal of subject and complement

!Xun is a fairly isolating-analytic language having primarily, though not exclusively, head—
dependent order of constituents. There is no grammaticalized case system. Case relations are
marked in particular by means of the following:
(a) word order, used in particular to distinguish between subject and object,
(b) the transitive suffix *-a (see section 3.5), used for adding a participant not covered by the
valence of the verb,
(c) the linker *ke in P-NW and *kd in P-SE (see section 5.2.2), introducing an additional participant, and(d) verbal derivation (see section 6.2.2).","[116, 117]"
"1.4 Typological characteristicsW3~~soha

El29(b) !Xun is a highly context-dependent language, having fairly analytic-isolating morphology.
There is only a small pool of items which have exclusively grammatical function (Heine &
K6nig 2005) or which are not full-fledged phonological words.
(c) The basic word order is head—dependent and subject-verb—object, although there is a mi-a aeexhibiting dependent—head and object-verb word order (see sections 4.2.6, 6.1,(d) It has a non-sex-based gender (or noun class) system distinguishing three, in some dialects

The !Xun-speaking people differ both socio-economically and sociolinguistically from most
other peoples of southwestern Africa. The following general observation applies not only to
the San (“Bushmen”) living in Namibia, but characterizes more specifically the socio-economic situation of virtually all !Xun speakers within and outside Namibia:
The Namibian San are living lives of poverty and dislocation. While different San peoples face different situations, there is a depressing common core to their poverty. It begins
with being landless, often on their own land (Willem Odendaal, The Namibian, October27, 2006).
With few exceptions, all !Xun communities are surrounded by Bantu-speaking societies,
who are not only numerically much stronger but also socially, politically, and economically
dominant. It therefore comes as no surprise that most !Xun speakers of W1 and W2 are fluent
in the Bantu language Kwanyama, those of Kin Kwangari, and those of E3 in Herero, and inmuch of their daily intercourse these !Xun make use of the respective Bantu languages.
Nevertheless, in most of the cases just mentioned there is no indication of language shift:
small children grow up with !Xun as their first and only language, and it is only later in their
childhood that they acquire a second language. In spite of all the social and economic pressure
exerted by the Bantu-speaking communities on the !Xun, the linguistic impact is — perhaps
surprisingly — fairly moderate; the amount of lexical borrowing and grammatical replication
to be found in !Xun is in most communities comparatively small.
Language maintenance is an important discourse in most !Xun communities, not seldom
manifested in a pronounced form of linguistic purism, aimed at keeping foreign words out of
the language. Many a time were we instructed by our !Xun consultants to delete a given word
because it was said to be a loanword and to replace it by a “genuine” !Xun word, although
they themselves were constantly found using the former, and quite some time was spent with
searching for a proper !Xun equivalent. The following case is indicative of the language attitude of many !Xun people that we had the chance to consult: in our discussions with E3
speakers in Gobabis, these speakers tended to eliminate words that they suspected to be loanwords because they found similar form-meaning pairings in other languages they were familiar with. For this reason they asked us to eliminate the verb Aij ‘help’, arguing that this is a
Khoekhoe (Nama) word; as a matter of fact, however, Ail? is a Proto-!Xun stem (*hii ‘help’)
to be found in virtually all dialects Angola, Namibia, and Botswana (cf. table 1-5).
There is little communication across and knowledge about fellow !Xun communities. Even
neighbouring !Xun communities are frequently ignorant of each other’s linguistic and other
whereabouts. Hasselbring (1999: 78) reports that E3 (#Kx’au-ll’ein) speakers said that it took
them a few months before they could understand the neighbouring El dialect of Tsumkwe
(Jul’hoan), that it would be difficult for them to learn to read and write E1 and that they would
rather learn to read and write in their own “language”, or in the Central Khoisan language
Naro since they are more familiar with the latter. Note that — as the classification in table 1-2
shows — E3 and E1 are very closely related, neighbouring dialects.","[15, 16]"

A sentence consists minimally of a verb; the verb therefore forms the core of an utterance.
Ignoring question words, adverbs and auxiliary elements that may also appear in the verbphrase, the order of main constituents is as summarized in table 3-1. With the exception of the
verb stem (and in W2 and E3 the topic marker), none of these constituents is obligatory. Theverb stem may be extended either by the transitive suffix *-a (section 3.5) or by derivational
extensions (section 6.2.2).

"We are restricted here to constructions involving two verbs, which account for the vast ma-jority of token occurrences. Constructions with three or more verbs exhibit the same principles of organization but show some complexities which would require much further discussion. As table 3-7 shows, there are seven types of SVCs to be distinguished on the basis of the
syntactic notions proposed above. These types are not evenly distributed however; whereas
types 1a and 3 occur highly frequently in our data, accounting for more than half of all tokens,
type 1b and 4b are extremely rare. The Dickens typology takes care only of our types 2b (his

the “non-sex-based gender” type, showing both semantic and formal gender assignment (see
Corbett 2005a, 2005b). Kohler (1971: 522) observes that the noun class system of !Xun has
no parallel in the remainder of Khoisan” and that its origin and development are unknown.
The system is covert, that is, nouns do not have any formal class marking on them; class
“Membership can be derived only from pronominal exponents referring to nouns. There are
four individual noun classes, more precisely, agreement classes (see Giildemann 1999; Giildemann & Vossen 2000). The pronominal exponents of noun classes and their dialectal distribulion are summarized in table 4-5. These noun class markers are at the same time third person
‘Pronouns, used in much the same way as subject, object, and possessor pronouns.
Compared to the noun class system of the Bantu languages, that of !Xun is fairly “poor”,
both with reference to its structural complexity and its function as a device for reference

form ofa noun provides no clues on the class to which that noun belongs, (b) the number oflasses is small, not exceeding four in any dialect, (c) the system is restricted to the nounase and does not affect the verbal group, and even within the noun phrase it is restricted to‘honey-comb’ (Heikkinen 1987: 62)W modifying categories, namely personal pronouns,demonstratives,and possessee pro-‘ ouns, and (d) its contribution to distinguishing number is minimal, especially but not only3 eS, number is not generally distinguished on nouns, except for suppletive forms (see also!Xun can be described as a language having typically head—dependent order, that is, with
the exceptions just mentioned, nominal modifiers follow the noun, e.g.,E2jui-speople- PLathiRELmany= fiéfieRELDEM4 Clearly, the most frequent use of the system is made with personal pronouns. But even
- distinctions are frequently reduced to a binary contrast between animate participants, rested to by the N1 marker *ha, and inanimate ones, referred to by the inanimate N4 marker

Attributive vs. predicative modifiers
There is some variation in the way modifiers are placed relative to one another, both acros
dialects and within a given dialect (see, e.g., Kéhler 1973: 66f. for E2). In SE-!Xun, thoug
not in NW-!Xun, noun modifiers can be divided into two types: attributive and predical™ %
modifiers. While the former are added to the head noun without any formal linkage, the latte

the Khoisan family or phylum (see, e.g., Greenberg 1963), and there are in fact numerous lexical and grammatical forms that !Xun shares with other South African Khoisan languages.
However, it is not entirely clear whether these shared forms are due to genetic inheritance orlanguage contact, or to chance. There is therefore some justification to treat !Kun as a genetic
isolate, that is, as a language grouping for which no genetic relationship to any language
family has been established. But there is one other language that we hypothesize to be genetically related to !Xun, namely the Eastern Hoan language (henceforth in short: #Hoan), spoken by small groups of hunter-gatherers in Botswana. !Xun and +Hoan jointly form what we
propose to call the Kx’a family of languages, a term taken from the root *kx’& ‘ground, soil’
which is shared by all the linguistic communities concerned” (Honken 2004; Heine & Honken
2010).
The !Xun-speaking people are arguably the most well-known traditional hunter-gatherer
society of Africa. There is a wealth of anthropological work on all aspects of the social, cultural and economic life and the ecology of the society (see, e.g., Marshal] 1962, 1967, 1999;
Lee & DeVore 1968, 1976; Lee 1979, 1984; Wilmsen 1989; Solway & Lee 1990; Biesele
1993; see also the references in Willet 2002, 2003), and the !Xun have been the subject ofcontroversies relating more generally to human behaviour and evolution. Virtually all of this
work, however, has focused on one specific segment of the population, namely the Juhoan(si), that is, speakers of the El dialect (see table 1-1). Other than that, we still know
very little about this people (but see, e.g., Takada 2005, 2007, 2008). The approximate distrib-ution of the present !Xun-speaking area is found in map 1 (see also Brenzinger 2000), ignoring the !Xun-speaking groups that were re-settled in 1994 to Schmidtsdrift, South Africa (see
Weich 2004; Robbins 2006, 2007).
The language has come to be known under a variety of different names. The reasons for referring to both the people speaking this language and their language as !Xun ([!xii], meaning
Person, people’), rather than adopting the alternative name Ju or Jul’hoan, or Jul’hoansi that
has also been proposed (e.g., Giildemann & Vossen 2000), are given in section 1.1. There is
no reliable information on the total number of !Xun speakers; according to- our highly tenta=e estimate, there are between 10,000 and 15,000 people who speak !Xun as their first lanage.
The evidence available suggests that !Xun can be described as an L-complex, that is, as acluster of speech forms that appears to be connected by a chain of mutual intelligibility, butSpeakers at the extreme ends of the chain do not understand one another. For example, !Xun
Speakers of central Angola do not understand !Xun speakers of eastern Namibia or northwestoe
Even dialects presumed to be fairly closely interrelated are not necessarily mu-re cornea
aStill, no clear-cut language boundary separating the various !Xun varieties= momied so far. Since there is reason to believe that all the !Xun varieties that haveton,notice so far are linked by some intelligibility chain, we prefer to treat the various
S as a single, even if complex, language.","[7, 8]"

In addition to the categories listed above, there is another category that K6nig (forthc.) found
in the W2 dialect. This category, called the resumptive pronoun by Kénig, consists of the

We were not able to present an exhaustive list of demonstratives. Creating new demonstrative-based pronouns or adverbs belongs to the most lively domains in !Xun grammaticaliza-‘Then they ate that honey.’ (Heikkinen 1987: 18)ElkéTOPThis resumptive pronoun of W2 thus is a pre-nominal attributive modifier of a subject NP

not restricted to animate subject referents:ExamplesW2-~ma1sG‘This is a tree and the tree is short.’Note that W1 and W2 frequently place a noun class marker before the referential demonstrative, but this does not appear to be the case in SE-!Xun.",[81]

limited to a few dialects.
The grammatical information presented in this book is of two kinds: on the one hand there
are generalizations on the language as a whole, applying to all dialects; on the other hand, we
discuss linguistic features that are characteristic of one single dialect or group of dialects only.

1.1 NomenclatureIn order to use a coherent terminology throughout this volume we had to make two major decisions on nomenclature.
The first concerns the name of the language as a whole. The terminology on linguistic and
ethnic identities relating to the people who are the subject of this study is complex.° A number
of terms are used for the !Xun and their language, like !Kung, Kung, !Xi, !Xii, Ju, ZuSasi, Zul’hoan, Jul’hoansi, etc; see Treis (1998: 465-9) and Miller-Ockhuizen & Sands(1999) for discussion of the confusion surrounding the terminology on !Xun (= Northern
Khoisan) as a whole and of individual !Xun varieties; Miller-Ockhuizen & Sands (1999: 402)
counted no less than 88 terms used for this dialect group. Heikkinen (1987: 3) says that the
“population group in Ovamboland and Kavango” call themselves /xiin ‘person, Bushman’.
KGhler (1971: 491) observes that the people of the eastern dialect studied by him call “themselves and their language !Xii 3u-lhoa, with the variant 3u-lhoasi in the plural”. Miller-Ockhuizen & Sands use !Kung to refer to the whole group except Jul’hoan. All speakers we were
able to consult in the central and northern !Xun area call themselves /xiin and their language!xintin dhali.","[9, 10]"

The outcome is that there now exists a well developed written form for E1, based on the work of Patrick Dickens (1991, 1997;Aikhenvald, A.Y. & R.M.W. Dixon (eds.). 2006. Serial Verb Constructions: A cross-linguis-see Giildemann1998; Dickens 2005, Introduction). But in all these activities, other !Xun dia-lects were entirely ignored, hence there is no comparable written form for any of the other
dialects.
Consultations with speakers of NW-!Xun dialects showed that they understand one another
to quite some extent but that they do not understand E1 or any other of the SE-dialects, and
that they would reject the written form based on E1 since it is a different language for them,
even if they all are aware of the close linguistic and cultural relationship. At the same time,
there is a high demand among these speakers to have “their language” reduced to writing, at
least for use in basic education. The dialects of Central !Xun, which could provide a link between the two dialect branches, do not seem to be of any significance in this debate: we have
not been able to find any Central !Xun group that would use the language actively in daily
interaction and would like to have their varieties reduced to writing.
On the basis of these observations, the most sensible solution appears to be to develop a
second written norm for !Kun, based on the W1 and W2 dialects, which dispose of larger
communities of speakers interested in having their mother tongue used in reading and writing.
In order for such a language planning project to be successful, however, it would be indispensable to have all other dialects of NW-!Xun appropriately represented in decisions on language planning, most of all K speakers of Kavango Region, W3 speakers of Tsintsabis, and

"Of all these branches it is SE-!Xun which experienced the most profound grammatical
change (but see also chapter 10 on personal pronouns). This was made possible via the grammaticalization of the transitive suffix *-a to a relative clause marker. Since this suffix is found
in all dialects on both verbs (see section 3.5) and nouns (section 6.1), we hypothesize that it
had this dual function already at the stage of Proto-!Xun, allowing not only verbs but also
nouns to take an additional complement. The innovation characterizing SE-!Xun was that tt
underwent a common grammaticalization process, extending the use of *-a from nominal to
clausal participants — with the effect that SE-!Xun created a new and highly productive relativizer -4, which was not only employed for presenting clauses but also demonstratives and
some interrogative words (section 9.2.2.3).
That grammatical forms serving the introduction of nouns are grammaticalized to clause
subordinators is a cross-linguistically common process: most languages have undergone it Mt
some way or other.' We argue that in SE-!Xun the transitive suffix underwent what in gral:
maticalization theory is called divergence: whereas the relativizer -4 retained its stable ton®the transitive suffix on both verbs and nouns lost its tone, assimilating to the tone of the pre
ceding syllable.
The change that this development introduced in the SE-dialects El, E2 and E3 was the following: Proto-!Xun must have been a verb-prominent, head-marking language, where gram-matical relations within the sentence were encoded primarily in the verb. With the rise of
highly productive mechanism of relativization, a number of functions expressed by verb seu
alization shifted to some extent to the noun phrase. For example, like in many other Afric321Conclusionsin !Xun. In SE-!Xun, relativization of verbs of state turned into the primary means of expressing adjectival concepts.
Another, related change in SE-!Xun concerned number, leading to a dramatic increase in
plural marking: generalization of the noun class 2 marker *si as a plural marker in relativization, producing the relative clause markers -a (singular) and -s-d (< *-si + -a; plural) in all
three SE-!Xun dialects (see chapter 4). Whereas in NW- and Central !Xun noun phrases are
most of the time unmarked for number — a situation that we hypothesize to also have characterized Proto-!Xun — number marking in SE-!Xun is to some extent (though not entirely)
mandatory. Nevertheless, even in SE-!Xun dialects, non-human nouns are not generally
marked for number. Thus, in the following example from the E1 dialect, it is only the suppletive verb that signals the singular/plural distinction of the object noun gumi ‘cow, cattle’:Elofhai
liongimi.gti.nihai!’6én_kill.SG cattlelionkill.PL cattle‘hin‘The lion killed the cow.’‘The lion killed the cattle.’If SE-!Xun speakers created a fairly complex noun phrase structure, their tense—aspect system remained somewhat underdeveloped, possibly reflecting the situation of Proto-!Xun: other than preverbal clitics *ki (progressive) and *koh (past), there is little in terms of tense—
aspect morphology in SE-!Xun. Compared to that, NW-!Xun developed a range of functional
categories, even if their use remained largely optional.
These are perhaps the major innovations to be observed in !Xun dialects. Otherwise, and in
spite of the many individual changes that occurred in all dialects, as we saw in the preceding
chapters, the typological profile has remained largely the same across dialects.",[166]

structural difference between pronominal and nominal participants; cf. (3a) and (3b), where
