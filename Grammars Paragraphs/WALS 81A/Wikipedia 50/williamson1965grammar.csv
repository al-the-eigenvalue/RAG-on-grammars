THESENTENCE AND THE PREDICATEPHRASE-STRUCTURE RULES
2.0 This chapter contains the phrase-structure rules of the grammar. They have been
kept as simple as is consistent with a reasonably full coverage, and are to be applied in
order. T h e principle followed in ordering the rules has been to develop constituents
roughly in their order of importance rather than strictly from left to right. Lexical rules,
following Lees's example, are treated together at the end (2.3) Overlapping in membership between lexical classes has been freely admitted.
I n the translation of examples, a morpheme by morpheme rendering has been provided
where the correspondence of xjp to English morphemes is not reasonably clear. Ahhreviations of very frequent function words have been used to prevent the translation from
becoming too bulky, and are explained the first time they are used. I n literal translations,
hyphens unite two-morpheme equivalents of asingle Ijp morpheme: e.g. deril 'laugh-at'.
I n writing rules, conventions which have become established in transformational
grammar are for the most part used. T h e symbols are listed below.
X is replaced by Y.

X is optionally present, Y is obligatorily present.
(X) y2.1.1 T h e initial symbol S (sentence) is usually rewritten as noun phrase (NP) followed
by ~redicate(P), but there are two minor sentence types consisting of a vocative (Voc)

of I j p as Kwa, and the idea was dropped until recently suggested again by Greenberg.
In the interval, Ijp has been classed so as to stress its isolation. M . Delafosse in Mcillet
et Cohen, LES LANGUES DU MONDE (Paris, 1952), classifies Ijp as the sole member of a
'groupe bas-nigtrien'. His cited material is from Nembe, and he misinterprets the
definite articles and other affixes as evidence of a noun-class system, an error carried over
into Westermann and Bryan's LANGUAGS OF WEST AFRICA (Oxford, 1952), where Ij? is
treated in the chapter on class languages.
0.3.2 Since no general description of any ijo dialect has yet been published, it was
decided that an outline of the wholc system of one dialect, Kolokuma, would he more
useful than a description of a single aspect of the language. Before dealing specifically
with Kolokuma, some of the more unusual features of Tjp as a whole, and a few general
comparisons of ijp with other Niger-Congo languages, will be briefly indicated.
Tjp stands sharply distinguished from neighbouring languages in its complex system of
tonal morphophonemics and intonational modifications of tone patterns, described in
detail for IColokuma in Chapter 7. It is suggested by Gleason that a system of this type,
where word-tones are subordinated to larger tone patterns, marks a language which is,
historically, changing from a tonal t o a pitch-accent or purely intonational system
(LANGUAGE
37.300,1961). Most Niger-Congo languages are tonal, but some have lost their
tones: e.g. several West Atlantic languages, and Swahili in the Bantu group. T h e immediate neighbours of rj?, however, are all clearly tonal; some of them, such as Yoruba, have
a three-tone system, whcreas the original Ij? system seems to have had only two tones,
like Proto-Bantu.
Ijp has little morphology, but what there is contains several notcworthy features. I t has
lost the original Niger-Congo noun-class system, and few relics of it remain even as
meaningless vowel prefixes (as they do, for example, in Yoruba and Igbo). On the other
hand, it has a system of delinitc articles sutIixed to thc noun, apparently developed from
demonstratives. It is unusual, among Niger-Congo languages, in having a separatc
feminine pronoun, demonstrative and delinite article; some dialccts, though not Kolokuma, also have a neuter.
I n word-order, modifiers consistently precede heads and the object precedes the verb.
T h e most interesting syntactic feature is the verb phrase, which may contain a scries of
verb roots. Many 'Kwa' languages have a similar feature; Westermann has described it
in his GRAMMATIK DER EWE-SPRACHE (Berlin, 1907), Ida Ward in her INTRODUCTION TO
THE YO~IUBA LANGUAGE (Cambridge, 1952), and W. E. Welmers in his DESCRIPTIVE
G R A ~ X A ROF FANTI (Baltimore, 1946). I n Kolol~umathere arc, in many cases, no connecting or subordinating grammatical morphemes to show the relationship of the different
verb roots to one another, so that a good deal of experimenting is necessary to discover
the permissible combinations. Chapter 3 contains the results of these investigations.
OF KOLOKUMA
0.4 THESPEAKERS
T h e present study is a descriptive analysis of a single ijp dialect, Kolokuma, particularly
as it is spoken in the town of Iiaiama. Speakers call their language jzQn bell 'Ijp language'
or k6lolchmi bell 'Kolokuma dialect'. Members of the Iiolokuma-Opokuma clan live in
ten towns along the River Nun, from Igbedi to Odi. T h e men trade, fish, cut palmfruit
and do some farming; many leave home to work in Lagos, Ghana and elsewhere, often
as cooks, stewards, sailors or policemen. Most men and many women, therefore, speakINTRODUCTIONsome English or Pidgin, and often one or more other African languages - Igbo, Yoruba
Hausa; G5 or Fanti; even (in the case of an ex-serviceman) Swahili. T h e women do
of the farming and some fishing, as well as their household duties. Some Kolokuma
men marry Isoko or Aboh wives, and small communities of Isokos, forming their own
villages, live in the area to cut palmfluit. Most children attend the primary schools run
by the Church Missionary Society, where they learn English. For all education beyond
the primary level young people must go away from home, so that the area is constantly
being drained of its most intelligent and ambitious members. Geographical isolation
ensures that, while many Kolokumas leave their home town, not many outsiders come in;
there are usually more women than men in a town.","[6, 7]"
"46This chapter and the next two deal with transformations of the verb phrase, the noun
$rase, and the sentence respectively. Whatever part of the sentence they deal with,
transformationsare, in Lees's terms, either SIMPLE or GENERALIZED. A simple transformationinvolves re-ordering of a single string by means of additions, deletions, and/or changes
order. A generalized transformation combines two strings into a single one; it is either
or co-ordinating. I n a subordinating transformation, a certain part of a
CONSTITUENT sentence (labelled b) is incorporated into a MATRIX sentence (labelled A),
and normally precedes the part of the matrix sentence it is modifying. Otherwise stated,
subordinated or modifying elements normally precede the head. I n a co-ordinating
twosentences, labelled A and B, of roughly equal structure, are combined;
of the second sentence is co-ordinate with and follows part of the first sentence.
The following conventions and symbols are used in transformational rules in addition
to those introduced in chapter z.
In the structural description (SD), the source strings upon which the transformation
operates are specified, the various relevant parts heing separated by commas. (Commas
in transformational or morphophonemic formulae are used only for convenience in a
particular rule, to separate the elements to be re-ordered, and therefore do not have the
same.reference as those in the examples, which are used to separate tone phrases.) T h e
symhols W , X, Y, Z are used to denote parts of a sentence whose internal structure is
irrelevant to the transformation in question; the convention is observed that, within one
transformation, if X, etc., is used twice, it has the same internal structure each time.
Any conditionslimitingthe applicationof the rule arestated after thestructural description.
The elements separated by commas are assigned numbers. I n the structural change
(SC), these numbers are re-arranged, some occurring in a different order, some heing
omitted (for deletions), and added elements heing inserted at the appropriate place.
The symbol =- means 'is transformed into'. Wherever square brackets are used, an element
in a particular position in the first set of square brackets corresponds only to the element
in the matching position in the second set.
I n examples, two source sentences are linked by a brace and the transformation arrow
follows directly to introduce the resulting transform.
Transformations are only partially ordered, in that they have been arranged in groups
dealimg with particular structures. Within the groups, each of which occupies one of the
major sections of a chapter, rules are ordered, but the groups are not ordered with respect
to one another.
Transformations are numbered consecutively T.1, T.z, etc.; morphophonemic rules
are numbered M.1, M.z, etc. Transformational rules are optional except when stated to
he obligatory, morphophonemic rules are obligatory except when stated to he optional.
3.1 ~ N S F O R M A T I O N SINVOLVING VERBS OF MOTION
3.1.0 One of the most noticeable features of Ijp is its tendency to combine several
verbs in one verb phrase. Some of the most common combinations involve verbs of
motion and are treated below.

"0,5 T H E PRIISENTSTUDY
0.5.1 Fieldwork in Kaiama was carried out in August-September, 1957, June-July,
1959, and October, 196z-Jannary, 1963. T h e chief informants were:
Mr. F. Agara, church clerk (1959, 1962)
Mr. A. A. Akene, teacher (1957, 1959)
Mr. 0. A. Egberipou, teacher (1957, 1959, 1962-3)
Mr. Pianto Egberipou, secondary school student (1957, 1959)
Miss F. Kai, teacher (1957)
Mr. J. Orumokinren, trader (1957)
Mr. A. 0. Timitimi, trader and church treasurer (1959, 1962-3).
In 1959 a number of texts were collected from two elderly monolingual informants,
Chief 2. Amaran and Chief Y. Soobai, with the help of the Rev. J. Buseri. A little work
was also done in the United States with Mr. L. Ekpebu, a graduate student of Princeton
University. All of these people helped willingly, patiently, and with great interest in the
work. T h e discovery of the passive, for example, is due to Mr. 0. A. Egberipou, who
took the trouble to refute a statement that Tj? had no constluction corresponding to the
English passive.
0.5.2 An attempt has been made to write a kind of generative transformational grammar. Certain features of fjp appear to lend themselves well to such a treatment: for
example, the limits of the tone groups within which elaborate tonal morphophonemics
take place are determined by syntax, a fact which strongly suggests that the morphophonemics are better treated after the syntax, as in transformational grammars, rather
than before it. T h e plus sign has been used throughout to unite syntactic elements which,
after the application of the morphophonemic tone rules, will occur in the same TONE
GROUP. When these elements have been joined into tone groups, some tone groups will be
linked up into TONE PHRASES, the conditions for such linking being no longer syntactic but
tonal. Tone patterns are, therefore, to be treated not in isolation, but as a systcrn partly
interlocking with the syntax. By the systematic use of the plus sign, the tonal relationships demanded by the syntax are carried through to the morphophonemic rules, where
they are tinally realized.
I n some other respects, however, the transformational model has not been followed.
Transformational grammars which treat phonology as distinct from morphophonemics
usually do so in a distinctive feature analysis following the morphophonemic rules. This
is possible where the language is a familiar one with an accepted orthography, hut in the
case of a little-known language such as Ijp a transcription has to be provided before the
syntax can be studied. For practical reasons, therefore, chapter I is devoted to phonology,A G R A M M A R O F THE ICOLOKUMA D I A L E C T O F T J O11with the aim of setting out a transcription which is useful in later chapters. It. would, of
course, be possible to add another chapter after the morphophonemics continuing the j
analysis down to distinctive feature level, but in view of the treatment in chapter I this
has not been thought necessary.
Keeping a phoneme level allows statistical statements of frequency to be made (e.g.
1.4.4-5). Such statements are important in that part of the vocabulary of Kolokuma, the
ideophones,6 can be shown to have a phonological structure which is statistically different
from that of the other parts (1.5).
0.5.3 As regards syntax, the model followed has been that developed in N. Chomsky's
SYNTACTIC STRUCTURFS (The Hague, 1957) and R. Lees's THE GRAMMAR OF ENGLISH
NOMINALIZATIONS (IJAL26:3, Part z , 1960). It is not suggested that this grammar is either
a complete exemplification of generative transformational grammar or that the data might
not be susceptible of a description, from another theoretical viewpoint, of equal or grcater
validity. T h e approach was adopted because it was thought that the practical attempt to
apply some of the new methods to a little-known language might be of interest, particularly since it bas been suggested that they can be applied only when the linguist has 'a
very deep and expert understanding of a language' (Lees, p.186). Two comments suggest
themselves on this statement. The first is that while certain deep underlying similarities
in a language rcquire expert knowledge, other parts of the grammar are open to quite
simple transformational statements (e.g. the active-passive relation). Secondly, it is
possible that languages have sufficient in common for similar rules to be applied to parts
of their grammars. Lees himself points out the close similarities between English and
German nominalizations. I t is more surprising to find that, in describing Ijg, many of
at least the more general rules for sentence and noun-phrase transformations are strongly
reminiscent of rules which would be necessary for English, and that only the structure
of the verb phrase appears markedly alien. If transformational analysis were developed
with contrastive grammar in mind, it might be possible for a relatively small number of
analyses made from deep knowledge to serve as reference points for a larger number of
grammars of languages for which more superficial information was available.
0.5.4 Some divergences from transformational practice in this grammar are due to the
fact that wo1.k on Kolokuma was done through informants, whereas in most transformational grammars so far published the linguist has been his own informant and the grammar has thercfore been that of a single idiolect. A neat, consistent analysis is often possible
for one idiolect which hrealcs down when a number of different idiolects are studied. The
study of I<olol~umais based largely on a corpus of texts (mostly folk tales and proverbs
with a few descriptive or historical texts) which were tape-recorded-and then transcribed,
with the help of informants, and also on a body of isolated sentences, many of which
were suggested by sentences in the texts and were elicited in the search for sentences
which bear a transformational relation to one another. There are thus a number of
idiolects and styles represented, and it is therefore necessary, at certain points, either to
suggest alternative rules (e.g. 7.1,6), to note that variation exists (e.g. 3 . 7 . ~ )or~ to leave
the rule open for further study.
0.5.5 The problem of idiolectal variation is related to another one, which is also raised
by working with texts given by informants. Some transformations appear to he much

~~~~~.%INTRODUCTIONmore basic than others: e.g. some expansions of the noun phrase, or the interrogative,
are basic enough to require description in any grammar, whereas certain ellipses occurring
in the texts would be described only where a requirement of comprehensive coverage of
the corpus had been made. Just as the kernel is in some sense more basic than the optional
transformations, so some of the transformations, and some transformed sentences, are
more basic than others.
hi^ conclusion is reinforced by observation of the editing carried on by informants
when they repeated slowly for transcription what had been recorded at a natural speed on
the tape; not only did they e l i i n a t e coughs and slips of the tongue, but they also left out
false starts, and even re-phrased something they felt ungrammatical when it was played
back. In particular, a bilingual informant translating a text recorded by an aged monolingual speaker frequently objected to the repetitious style of the old man and re-phrased
parts of it despite pleas to repeat exactly what was on the tape. The recording and the
final transcription were clearly both utterances in the language, but in different styles.
~t is suggested that such a d i i r e n c e in style can be correlated with the extent of transformation the utterance has undergone, the more colloquial unstudied one being transformed to a much greater degree.
If sentences can be repeatedly and indefinitely transformed in this way, it follows that
a grammar can produce all the sentences of a language only if a line is drawn at which a
sentence cannot be further transformed without ceasing to be a sentence. T h e exact line
might be arbitrary, but could be drawn somewhere near the point where informants
begin to re-phrase texts. (Presumably a linguist acting as his own informant normally
performs the same editing process for himself.) The degree of grammaticality, or alternatively the degree of colloquiality of style, of a particular recorded text could then be
described in terms of the proportion of sentences to non-sentences it contained.
0.5.6 The presence of informants has led to an attempt to formulate transformational
rules as realistic transformations of real sentences, intuition for extremely hypothetical
constructs not being available. Some difficulties arise in the course of this procedure, in
that realistic sources cannot be found for some strings, although these strings bear a
strong resemblance to others for which convincing sources are available. For example,
there is a fixed noun phrase t Q r y di ye 'spectacles, glasses', literally 'eye look-at thing'.
I t superficially resembles other noun-verb-noun phrases such as beni wen1 igbika
'rainboot', literally 'water walk thing', which is regularly generated by T . 3 2 T h e source
sentences necessary to generate t+ry di ye by T.32 do not, however, occur, and no other
convincing source can be found. T h e following rather ad hoc solution is suggested. Not
all apparent transforms are real ones, i.e. developed directly from source strings. Once
a pattern has been established (in this case, noun-verb-noun), similar strings are formed
to it by analogy to the transforms. Analogy is generally recognized as a factor in linguistic
change, and there seems no reason why it should not be active at the transformational
level as at others. T h e difficulty still remains of finding an adequate way of formulating
such analogical rules; if this can be done, the process involved is comparable to that
whereby a complex series of phonological rules is replaced by a simpler one (M. Halle,
WORD 18.65, 1962).
0.5.7 An effort has been made to give rules to account for as much as possible of the
text material. There has, therefore, been no attempt to present only rules which show
elegant transformational relationships. I n deciding what is to go into the phrase-structure
rules and what into the transformations, the guiding principle has, as far as possible, beenA GRAMMAR O F T H E KOLOICUMA D I A L E C T O F I J Oproductivity; that is, the constructions which occur in the most varied combinations with
other constructions have been assigned to the phrase-structure rules, less flexible constructions mainly to the transformations. Compromise has been necessary in the case of
elements which cannot reasonably be introduced transformationally and have therefore
been assigned to the phrase-structure rules out of necessity. For example, very little can
be done with interjections, but since they cannot he derived from anything else they are
necessarily introduced in the phrase-structure rules.
0.5.8 Semantic criteria have been used in a few cases where they seemed appropriate
and necessary, for example in the analysis of the aspect markers (2.1 .z and Appendix I).
It has been assumed that there are collocational as well as grammatical limitations on the
occurrence of morphemes, the collocational ones being those which can be predicted with
a high degree of probability from the English translation before the attempt is made to
elicit an Ijo equivalent, and which are, therefore, considered outside the scope of this
grammar.","[7, 8, 9]"

3.5 PASSIVEAND INTRANSITIVE
3.5.1 A passive is formed to transitive sentences with a definite object or to sentences
containing a locative (definite or indefinite), the subject in each case being indefinite.
Pronouns in this case act like definite nouns, since a sentence with a pronoun subject
has no passive. T h e passive is formed by change of word order and of tone pattern.

I n this example of the passive of a sentence containing alocative it is impossible to show
the difference between active and passive in the English translation. The construction is,
however, quite parallel to that of the passive of a transitive sentence. I n each case the subject of the active sentence immediately precedes the verb in the passive but forms a different
tone group from it; some tone groups l i d up (7.2) to form tone phrases (as in the second
example), while others remain unlinked, separated by a comma (as in the first example).

"PHONOLOGY
ELEMENTS,JUNCTURES AND DISTRIBUTION
I.o.o At the phonological level Kolokuma can be describedin terms of PIIONEMES and
p ~ o ~ ~ ~ ~which
MES
are, distributed in SYLLABLES,
UNITS,WORDS, TONE GROUPS,
TONE
PHRASES and BREATH GROUPS, of which all but syllables and tone groups are delimited
by JUNCTURES.
1.0.1 The terms PHONEME and PROSODEME are preferred to SEGMENTAL PHONEME andSUPRASEGMENTAL PHONEME because the analysis of nasalization here given (1.3) requiresthat it be sometimes a suprasegmental and sometimes a segmental feature. Thc definition
of PROSODEME is, however, different from that given by E. Haugen, 'Phoneme or Prosodeme? (LANGUAGE
25.278-82, 1949): 'any significant sound feature whose overlap of
other features is temporally correlated to syllabic contour'. As used in the present study,
a prosodeme can be correlated with longer elements than a syllable (1.0.3); it includes
what, in the other terminology, would be suprasegmental MORPHEMES.
Thelimitation of the termPHoNEMErequires theuse of the wider term PHONOLOGY, rather
than phonemics, for the subject matter of this chapter. As used here, PHONOLOGY includes the description of both phonemes and prosodemes.
1.0.2 Phonemes consist of VOWELS (1.1) and CONSONANTS (1.4). They are distributed
in sillables and units.
I .o.3 Prosodemes consist of VOWEL HARMONY(I .2), distributed in units and words;NASALIZATION (1.3), distrihuted in syllables and units; TONEMES (1.6) distributed in syl-lables and breath groups; and TONE PATTERNS (1.7), distributed in units, tone groups
and tone phl.ases.
1.0.4 A SYLLABLE is a tone-bearing entity whose nucleus is either a single vowel or
nasalization realized as a nasal homorganic with a following plosive (1.3.1). No juncture
is postulated between syllables. Units are delimited by word space and/or hyphens;
words are delimited by word space; tone phrases are delimited by commas and/or any
other punctuation mark; breath groups are delimited by any punctuation mark except
commas.
Thus in the sentencenbelei, wiri-? bo-doy
lizard house to come has
Lizard has come home
there are ten syllables, five units, three words, two tone phrases, and one breath group.
Four junctures are set up: HYPHEN JUNCTURE,
symbolized by a hyphen; WORD
JUNCTURE,
symbolized by word space; COMMA JUNCTURE, symbolized by a comma; and
SENTENCE JUNCTURE, symbolized by any other punctuation mark. The first two junctures
are not marked by any pause phenomena, and comma juncture has only a slight optional
pause; they are set up as devices for simplifying the description of the distribution of the
phonemes and prosodemes. Sentence juncture is, however, phonetically marked by
pause, and vowel elision does not take place across it, as it does across other junctures.",[9]

raises are discussed by G. I. Jones in AFRICA 28.44 (1958) and by P. I3. I-I. Hair in 'The
early study and literature of some lower-Niger-Benue languages rgoo-1890' (MS.).5
The numerals 1-5 were collected in the early seventeenth century and published in
0. Dapper's NAURBURIGE BESSCHRIIVINGE DER AFRIKAENESCI~ GEWESTEN 2.135 (2nd ed.
1676) Numerals were also published in E. Norris, OUTLINE OF A VOCABULARY OF A FEW
OF TIIE PRINCIPAL LANGUAGES OF WEST AND CENTRAL AFRICA (London, 1840). J. Clarke's
SPECIMENS OF DIALECTS (Berwick-upon-Tweed and London, 1848) contains numerals in
four Eastern dialects (Okrika, Bonny, ISalabari, and Nembe) and ten other words in
Bonny, Kalabari, and Nembe.
The first substantial record of an Ijo dialect is a vocabulary and grammatical outline of
Bonny by Hermanu Koler in EINIGE NOTIZEN iiBER BONNY AN DER KiiSTE YON GUINEA,
MIT EINEM GLOSSARIUM (Gottingen, 1848). There
SEINE SPRACHE UND SEINE BEWOHNER,
are two Ijg word lists in S. W. Koelle's POLYGLOTTA AFRICANA (London, 1854), one of
Bonny (Okuloma) and one of a western dialect (Ud~o).1. C . Taylor's IJO OR IDHO PRIMER
(London, 1862) has faults, as its author was aware; like most later writings in Ijg it
distinguishes only seven of the nine vowels, and it sometimes mistranslates the English;
it is apparently based on the Nembe dialect. The first primer in Bonny is W. E. L.
Carew's PRIMER IN THE UBANI DIALECT OF THE IDSO LANGUAGE (London, 1870). F. E. G.
Johnson's VOCABULARY OF THB BONNY LANGUAGE (Lagos, 1903) and PRIMER I N THE IJO
LANGUAGE (London, 1911) have not been seen.
The first useful information on Nelnbe is given by Adebiyi Tepowa in 'Notes on the
(Nembe) Brass language', JOURNAL OF THE AERICAN SOCIETY 13.117-33 (1904). N. W.
Thomas gives vocabularies of 'Degema' (i.e. ISalabari), Nembe and Bonny in SPECIMENS
OF LANGUAGES WOM SOUTIIERN NIGERIA (London, 191I ) .
Little but religious translation has been published in Ijg. The earliest are two short
translations into Bonny by W. E. I,. Carew: PORTIONS OF SCRIPTURE and A PORTION OF
SIMPSON'S PRIMER,
both published in 1870. I n Nembe there is the Book of Common
Praycr (1923) and the complete Bible (1956). The Prayer Book has also been published
in Okrika, Kalabari and Kolokuma; thc Catholic Catechism and a Jehovah's Witnesses
booklet in Western Ijp. There are a few primers for schools, and Dinah D. S. ISalio has
published a collcction of Okrika proverbs: KABO NA GRUN EKWEIN NA KIRIKENI BIPI BU
(Port Harcourt, 1960). Two members of the Western Ijg Language Committee have
produced works on their language: M. L. Agbegha has writtcn EON MO BEKE MO TEN-EYE
FUN: IJAw-ENGLISH VOCABULARY (Warri, 1961), and T . 0. Ouduku RZQN XEBE GE BRR
ME:HOW TO WRITE THE IJAW LANGUAGE (TVarri, 1960).
In recent years several linguistic studies of Ijg have appeared. Hans Wolff has published vocabularies of ISalabari, Nembe, Kolokuma and North-Western Ijg in 'Niger
Delta languages I: Classification', ~ V T H ~ O P O L O G I C ALINGUISTICS

excellent tonal analysis of Nembe has appeared: E. C. Rowlands, 'Tone and intonation

also a treatment of the ISolokuma tone system which is superseded by the present work:
K. Williamson, 'The units of an African tone language', PHONETICA 3 :2/3.145-66 (1959).

i{Ez;:]2.2.11 The next six rules generate sequences of numerals. The general principles of
the system are these: there are nine digits (Dig) and the higher numerals 6iz 'ten', siz
'twenty', ondez 'four hundred', and ondena onde 'four hundred times four hundred';
a higher numeral can be multiplied by a preceding number not higher than itself, and a
number lower than itself can be added after it, related by fjnjz 'be extra'. These rules,
with the addition of three obligatory transformations (T.42-q), which make some
changes in order and delete more than one occurrence of fjnjz, generate numeral
sequences up to 25,600,000,000; but the more complex possibilities are not normally
used, sequences containing more than four or five numeral morphemes being
uncommon.
The combination sia si 'twenty times twenty' occasionally occurs but is not allowed in
these rules, which instead generate ondez 'four hundred'.mesi ma onde, 6ia si fjni

MODIFIED PRONOUNS: -ye (inanimate), - b q (masculine), -aray (feminine). Two of these,
-ye and -aray, are related in form to iyez 'thing' and iri(i4 'she'; the third one, -b?,
does not occur elsewhere. Setting up the class of modified pronouns therefore accounts
for the limited distribution of -lqand, and, by allowing the occurrence of pronouns
after modifiers, removes a restriction on their distribution.

in three ordered sets of rules. T h e first set deals with the tone pattern within the tone
group; that is, with the tone pattern within stretches whose units have until the present
been linked by plus signs (+). T h e second set unites certain of the tone groups into
longer tone phrases, the conditions for this linking being purely tonal. T h e third set
introduces intonational modifications into the tone phrases.
Finally, there is a set of rules dealing with vowel elision and tone elision resulting
therefrom.",[51]
"1.2.2 Vowel harmony extends over a whole word in two cases:
(a) When a short pronoun prefix (an object or a possessive) consists of a high vowel, it
harmonizes with the verb or noun following it:
i-yeqi
[-dav
my father
my mother
u-dii
y-t/jn
call him
look at him
A unit containing no vowel but a takes the open form of a high-vowel prefix:
i-ti
your wife
(I-bai kill him
Pronoun prefixes containing a non-high vowel do not harmonize with the following unit:
?-dii
look at them
q-tjjn
call them
Short pronoun subjects frequently but not invariably harmonize with the following
morpheme if they contain a high vowel; this concord is a case of harmony extending
across word juncture:
i bo-mi,
I came
/ bq-m[
I passed
i bo-mi
iyi oki-mi, I swam
iyi andi-mi I wrestled
jyi oki-mi
(b) When a monosyllabic enclitic contains i (no monosyllabic enclitics containing
other high vowels occur), the enclitic harmonizes with the preceding unit:
timi-mi
created
tern$-m j
existed
toru-bi
tQry-bi
the river
the chalk

These three dialects are very closely related and mutually intelligible.

I. Brass-Nembe proper, spoken in Nembe, Brass, l'wgn, Olrpgma, and one or two

of h for most of Nembe s, f (H. Wolff, 'Subsystem typologies and area linguistics',
ANTHROPOLOGICAL LINGUISTICS I :7.1-88; October, 1959).
Brass-Nembe is not fully intelligible with other dialects, perhaps partly bccanse, as
suggested by E. C. Rowlands, the distribution of high and low tones is somewhat different
in Nembe from what it is in other dialects ('Tone and intonation systems in BrassNemhe Ijaw', AFRICAN LANGUAGE STUDLFS I ,137-54; London, 1960). I n the hope that this
centrally located dialect would become the basis of a standard Ijg, the entire Bible was
translated into it (British and Foreign Bible Society, London, 1956), but the translation
is used only in the Brass-Nembe and South-Central areas. 13.TVolff discusses the curious
problcm of 'one way intelligibility' between South-Eastern and Nembe speakers; a
Nembe man claims to understand a Ralabari, but not vice versa ('Intelligibility and
inter-ethnic attitudes', ANTHR~POLOGICAL LINGUISTICS I :3.34-41; March, 1959). On the
Swadesh zoo-word list, Nembe seorcs 73.9% with Kalabari, a percentage almost significantly different-rom the 65.2% it scores with Kolokuma and the 64.6% it scores with
Boma. Brass-Nembc speakers can, however, communicate with some Central speakers,
especially of South-Central dialects.",[5]

INTRODUCTIONE. South-Eastern:
I . Eduwini, spoken by the large Eduwioi clan, who live along the coast from theMidwest-East boundary to the mouth of the Forcados.
2. Ogula, spoken by Ogula clan around the mouth of the Forcados.
3. Oporws~,spoken by Oporoza (Gbaramatu) clan to the north of Ogula.
4. Arogbo, spoken in the town of Arogbo in Okitipupa division, Wcstern Region, where
it is surrounded by Yoruba-speaking towns.
Thesc dialects differ sharply from the North-Western ones and have certain features in
common with the South-Central and Nembe groups, suggesting ancient lines of communication through the coastal creeks as well as up and down rivers. No lexicostatistic
calculations have yet been made for this group.
I t is likely that a good deal of dialect borrowing talces place, for Inany Ijg men travel
widely while trading or, in eastern areas, fishing, and intermarriage between members of
different clans is also common. Nowadays, educated men such as teachers, clergy, and
minor civil servants are frequently transferred from one area to another and are often
acquainted with several dialects. There is, too, considerable influence upon a number of
dialects from nearby languages. All Ijg groups trade with their neighbours. In addition,
because of certain peculiarities in the rjg marriage system, there has for some time heen
a tendency for rjg men to marry women from non-Ijp groups; consequently, a large
number of children grow up biimgual. An Igbo in Okrika can speilk his own language
and be understood. The effect of bilingualism on the Okriika dialect is seen in phonology
(e.g. three tonemes, like Igbo and unlike Kolokuma), morphology (e.g. the future-tense
morpheme -6ia, like Igbo and unlike ISolokuma), and lexicon (e.g. almost all names for
food-plants except 'yam' borrowed fi-om Igbo).
InRuence from non-Niger-Congo languages is confined to vocabulary. There are a few
indirect loans from Hausa, some from Portuguese into western dialects, and a recent
layer of loans from English.
It should be mentioned that Ijg as a linguistic term is not exactly '0-extensive with Ijp
as a political term. Opobo clan is at least sometimes considered politically Ijg, but speaks
Igbo, while Ogbja and Epie-Atissa clans consider themselves fully Ijg but speak an
Aboan and an Edo dialect respectively.
AND LITERATURE
0.3 CLASSIFICATION
0.3.1 Ijg is a Niger-Congo language, but there are no languages closely related to it and
its exact position within the Niger-Congo family is not yet clear. Iu 1927 Westermann
placed it, tentatively, in the Kwa group (DIE WESTLICHEN SUDANSPRACHEN UND IHRE
REZIEHUNGEN ZUM BANTU,
p.20). Greenberg in 1955 assigned it to s separate branch of
Niger-Congo (STUDIES
IN AFRICAN LINGUISTIC CLASSIFICATION),
but in 1963 considered it
a member of the Kwa branch (THELANGUAGES OF AFRICA,IJAL 29:1). It is not at present
clear to what extent the 'ISwa branch' actually constitutes a unity, so that it is rather a
matter of re-examining the relationship of all the languages in the area, including fjg,
than of trying to assign Ijo to a well-established group. Preliminary lexicostatistic counts
do not indicate any significant difference between the relationship of Tjp to Kwa and to
Benue-Congo languages.
Ijg has been less studied than some other Nigerian languages (e.g. Yoruba or Hausa).
There are several reasons; the variety of dialects, the use of Pidgin Englishin the early trade
with Europeans, and the relatively small number of missionaries who have lived in the area.","[5, 6]"

"PHONOLOGYA G R A M M A R O F T H E K O L O K U M A D I A L E C T O F I10(a) A very large number of ideophones are reduplicated (e.g. geengeenz 'shrill') or
even triplicated (e.g. I&lalaz'pure white'). I n a language where the distribution of vowels
is limited by vowel harmony and the distribution of consonants by statistical prohabilities, some reduplication would be expected and occurs (e.g. in reduplicated nouns like
e16rnulernb4 'well'). I t is, however, much more marked among the ideophones than in
other parts of the vocabulary. Out of 392 ideophones examined, 190 (48.4%) were reduplicated, 19 (48%) were triplicated, and 183 (46.6%) were neither. By contrast, on
the Swadesh zoo-word list, only seven forms (3.5%) were reduplicated and none was
triplicated; of units other than ideophones beginning with k, 7.80/, were duplicated
and none was triplicated.
(b) A much greater proportion of ideophones than of other units contain the same
vowcl throughout; this fact is particularly striking because idcophones, on the whole,
contain more syllables (and therefore more vowels) than other units. Of 158 forms on the
Swadesh zoo-word list which contained more than one vowel, 40 (about 25%) had the
same vowel throughout; of 385 ideophones with more than one vowel, 187 (about 48%)
had the same vowcl throughout.
(c) A much greater proportion of ideophones than of other units contain phonetically
long vowcls. Of the 3gz ideophones studied, 107, or roughly z5%, had a long
vowel; of non-ideophones beginning with k, only three, or about z:/,, contained a
long vowel.
(d) The most interesting property of ideophones is their tendency to cluster in groups.
Each member of the group differs only slightly from the other members, both phonologically and semantically:
geen4
geen4
goon4of an even, unblinking light; whence egengenl 'firefly'
of a steady light, brighter than geen4
of a light which is brighter than geen4, but does not bother one likegoon4of a light which is brighter than geen4 or geen4.geen4With these should he compared gegenegpgene4 'of someone with wilful, flashing eyes'
and ganl 'be light', possibly the starting point for the whole series, which is not itsbf an
ideophone.
T h e above example is typical in showing the main phonological variation borne by the
vowels. Of the threc dimensions in which vowels contrast, one is regularly and two
sporadically associated with a regular semantic distinction. Pairs of ideophones which
differ only in that one has close and the other open vowels refer to larger and smaller
objects respectively. Somewhat less consistently, non-high vowels refer to larger objects
than high ones, and back vowels to larger objects than front ones. These distinctions will
be illustrated from one particularly complete series, referring to the size and shape of a
man. Although there was some variation among informants in such a set, in that some
speakers would not accept all the forms given by others, all of them accepted several of
the series.
(a) Non-high vowels associated with largeness, high vourels with smallness:
gbegbereel refer to taller gbigbiriil

gbog borool
gbygbvrvylrefers to fatter
gbeg bereel
people than
refers to less thin gbjgbirjjl
people than1.5.2 I n view of these special features of ideophones, it might be expected that they
would show a peculiar distribution of consonants. I t does in fact appear that the frequency of certain individual consonants is different in ideophones: there are more ideophones than other units with initial kp, although ideophones constitute only about a
fifth of the collected vocabulary. But in terms of the overall distribution of plosives,
fricatives and sonorants, ideophones do not differ markedly from the rest of the vocabulary, and the figures for ideophones and other units have therefore not been distinguished
in 1.4.4-5.
1.6 TONEMES
I .6.1 There are two tonemes, ' high and ' low. Their allotones are described in relation
to syllables and breath groups; the tone patterns they form, however, are to he described
in terms of units, which in turn form tone groups and tone phrases (cf. 1.7 and 7.1-2).
Every vowel and unit-initial nasalization bears a tone. Tone marks are not written on
every syllable; instead, the following conventions are observed:
(a) Tones are marked in relation to tone phrases, which are separated by comma and
sentence juncture (i.e. by punctuation marks).
(b) Within a tone phrase, unmarked syllables at the beginning are low.
(c) The first high syllable in a tone phrase is marked high, the next low syllable is
marked low, etc.
(d) All unmarked syllables following a marked one hear the same tone as the marked
one.
(e) Units cited in isolation bear a subscript numeral assigning them to a morphophonemic tone class (1.7) if they ever occur initially in a tone phrase. They are marked with
the tone pattern they hear in this initial position.
(f) Other units cited in isolation are preceded by hyphen juncture; the tone patterns
marked on them are those they most frequently bear (1.7).
1.6.2 The following are the allotones of the high and low tonemes:
(a) I n the breath group, the first sequence of high tones is higher than the second, the
second than the third, etc., unless a sequence later than the first is raised for emphasis:
'he is not well';
each succeeding high tone is slightly lower than the preceding one.
eri, qng4, kyro-5A GRAMMAR O F T H E KOLOI<UMA DIALECT OF TI9(b) A final low tone in a breath group is lowcr than the earlier low tones. If the breath
group ends in two low tones on adjacent vowels (i.e. with no intervening consonant), they
are phonetically realized as a low-falling tone:
-imp? simple past tense before reported speech
(c) A high+a low tone on adjacent vowels result in a phonetic high-falling tone:
om6b4 sweat
(d) A low+a high tone on adjacent vowels result in a phonetic low-rising tone:
sanjj melt (intransitive)1.6.3 Stress is predictable. It falls:
(a) On the first of a series of high tones:
of6niz [3f6ni] bird
(b) On the first part of a phonetically falling tone:
om6b4 [6'm8ii] sweat
(c) On the first part of a phonetically rising tone, unless the vowcl of the first part is
high and the vowcl of the second non-high, in which case the second part is stressed:
but
ndai4 [h'dt]
so, then
anpa [inj'a]
(d) On the first syllable of a unit of shape W:
-hab
['&I
interrogative emphasizer
There is a distinct tendency towards a rhythm which is, in Pike's terms,4 neither
syllable-timed nor stress-timed. Tone groups tend to occupy roughly equal intervals of
time; a subject at the beginning of the sentence forming its own tone group is often
spoken slowly and followed by a slight pause, whereas the predicate which follows i t and
forms at least one new tone group is normally longer than the subject but, being spoken
faster, takes little more time to say. I n
jnqy-s+, gridugudu-k(i) 6mi 'the wound is very deep',
the four syllables of the subject (up to the comma) take roughly the same length of time
as the six syllables of the predicate (the i of -ki is elidcd).
I .7 TONE
PATTERNS1.7.1 Tone patterns extend over tone phrases, which are built u p from tone groups,
which in turn are built u p from units. T h e tone patterns borne by units in isolation are
frequently completely changed when the unit occurs in non-initial position in the tone
group, and sometimes partly changed even when the unit occurs in initial position. For
example, there are three nouns which in isolation have the following patterns:
bur6 yam
biri ward, quarter
war/ house.
Initially in a tone group the first of these has a different tone pattern while others do
not changc:
wiri-bi
buru-bi
biri-bi
the quarter
the house
the yam
I n non-initial position any of the nouns can have any of the four possible combinations
of high and low tone, depending on what precedes:

This monograph is a revised version of my Ph.D, dissertation, accepted by Yale University in 1963. Its history is largely a record of those to whom I am indebted. It is impossible to name them all in a brief preface; equally impossible for the work to appear
without thanks to the few who are named below and the many who have also contributed.
I first begall work on the I<olokuma dialect of Ijo in 1957 under the guidance of the
late Mr. H. J. Uldall, Senior Lecturer in Phonetics at the University of Ibadan, while
I held a Leverhulme Research Scholarship, and have continued at intervals ever since.
My field work has constantly been made pleasant by the interest and co-operation of the
Ijo people; among many others, I would like to mention Chief G. D. Appah and Mr.
J. H. B. Appah for their hospitality in Kaiama; 1Ur. S. K. Owonaro for his encouragement and comments on the phonology; Mr. Dagbo Alazigha for the use of his lists of

This grammar of Kolokuma began to take its PI-csent form when I was a student in
the Linguistics Department of Yale University. I am iudebted to Professor Bernard
Bloch and the whole Departme& for the atmosphere which allowed me to follow up my
own lines of interest. As regards my dissertation, I am particularly grateful to Professor
Samuel E. Martin, who supervised my wol-k and encouraged its progress, to Professor
Rulon S. Wells for his course on syntax, and to Professor I, Dyen for a better understanding of lexicostatistics.
My attempt to write a generative-transformational grammar stems from the interest
that I felt in the work of Noam Chomsky and others. I t seemed that certain features of
Ijg (such as the relation of the tone system to the syntax) might be interestingly described
by such methods. I have not, however, studied under transformationalists, and am well
aware that the grammar would be different if I had.
From the American Council for Learned Societies I received an Advanced Graduate
Fellowship in Linguistics, which enabled me to return to Nigeria for further fieldwork
and to write my dissertation there. To the Department of Linguistics and Nigerian
Languages, University of Ibadan, I am grateful for facilities for writing up the dissertation.
In the revision which preceded publication, I have had the benefit of much help from
Professor PaulSchachter, as a result of which the syntactic and morphophonemic rules
have been almost completely recast. The infelicities which remain are entirely my own
responsibility.
IBADANviiINTRODUCTION
0.1 Jjy (1jaw)l is a language spoken over a wide area in southern Nigeria. T h e Ijyspeaking peoples live mainly in Degema and Yenagoa Provinces in the Eastern Region
and in the Western Ijaw Division of Delta Province in the Midwest Region, with a few
outlying groups stretching as far west as Okitipupa Division in the Western Region. T h e
exact number of speakers is not known, but there are probably at lcast half a million.2
T h e area inhabited by Ijy-speakers forms part of the Niger Delta. T h e land is intersected by rivers and creeks; transport is often easier by water than by land. Conscquently
lines of communication tend to run u p and down stream, roughly from north to south,
rather than from east to west, except in the coastal creeks. T h e inland parts of the delta
are fertile, as the silt brought down by the Niger in the flood season (roughly, July to
Octoher) is deposited on the farmland; but the parts nearer the ocean and towards the
east are tidal, and little vegetation except mangroves flourishes in the salt water.
T h e economy of the salt-water area depends on fishing and on trading. From the
fifteenth to the late nineteenth century, the Eastern Jjy speakers developed city-states and
acted as middlemen between European traders on the coast and the peoples living in the
interior; contact with Europeans is, therefore, no novelty to Jjp peoples. 146th European
penetration of the interior, and particularly with direct access to the palm oil producing
areas, the Ijy monopoly of trade collapsed.3 T h e fresh-water areas were never so dependent on trade, relying mainly, as they still do, on agriculture supplemented by fishing.
Nowadays, the whole area suffers from lack of roads and industry, and has been classified
by the Nigerian Government as a Special Development Area. T h e discovery of oil in
various parts of the delta offers at least limited opportunities for employment to the
inhabitants of the area.","[1, 2, 3, 4]"

Vadj2.1.5 T h e main group of transitive verbs (Vtr.1) is optionally followed by a limited
group of second transitive verbs ( V t r . ~ ) ,which introduce a second complementation.

thing say him give
say something to him
Alternatively, a transitive verb is developed into the verb miel 'make' followed by a
causative phrase (CsP), which is not further developed in the phrase-structure rules, but
is replaced by a constituent sentence i n the transformational rules (T.14).

miel CsP2.1.6 Transitive verbs of type I consist of the following: a group that can be followed
by yarjl 'send' as second verb (Vtr.11); gbQz 'say'; aQz 't2ke'; verbs of saying (Vsay);
sense verbs (Vseu); verbs of change of state (Vch); and other transitive verbs (Vo),
which do not fall into any of the other types.

dbma tun-ni, a-pjri
song sing her give
sing a song for her
yaril 'send (to)' follows Vtr.11:
bide firimQ-nj, a-yarj
cloth send
her send
send her a cloth
(the object of the first verb, equivalent to the English direct object, is followed by fjrjmql
'send', yaril being used only to follow the second object and denote the person to whom
the sending was done). gb5z 'say' takes an inanimate object and is followed either by
piril or by dial 'show':
egberi gbi-ni, y-pjr/
story say
him give
tell him a story
y6 gba-nj, y-djQ
thing say him show
tell him something.
A verb of saying takes an object (most often animate) and is preceded by akjz 'take'
with another object (most often inanimate):
y6 akj-nt, y-bee
thing take him say
say something to him
wo-Qkj, dlirna t u n

sing a song about him.
A transitive directional verb (Vtr.d), preceded by a (frequently animate) object, takes the
suffix -rnQ 'towards, in regard to', and follows akjz 'take' with anormally inanimate object:

"-1.4.3 Consonants are distributed in syllables and units. T h e great majority of Kolokuma syllables can be summarized in the formula'I'
(C) V (N),
where C=consonant, V=vourel, T=tone, N=nasalization, and parentheses indicate
optional clcments. A few syllab!es do not fit this formula:
(a) As noted in 1.3.1, some unit-initial syllables consist of nasalization+tone.
(b) A few syllables end in a consonant; units containing such syllables are loanwords,
ideophones or interjections :
baptiizi4
baptize
dibdibdib4 freshly-cut and oozing
cry to shoo fowls
6s os
(c) A few units beginning with voiceless plosive+high vowel+ r have variants without
the vou,cl: pjrjl or pril 'give'. Such forms are probably dialect borrowings from NorthWestern Ij?, and the longer form is used throughout this study.
1.4.4 T h e distribution of consonants within the unit is not regulated as rigidly as that
of the vowels, but it is statistically though not absolutely limited. Table 4 shows what
combinations of first and second consonant (CI and Cz) were found in a tabulation of
559 units, each of which contained two consonants. (The first consonant may he either
initial or preceded by a vowel.)PHONOLOGYA GRAMMAR O F T H E K O L O K U M A D I A L E C T O F TJQPHONOLOGYA combination of the total occurrences of each consonant in C1 and Cz position yields
the results that are shown in Table 5,which give a rough idea of the lexical frequency&ble consonant combinations were quite regular and could be stated as rules and not
as fr~quencies.But there are two reasons why this is unlikely. Firstly, languages are
rarely, if ever, in a state of complete equilibrium; borrowing from other dialects and
languages is not likely to he a necessarily new feature of I<olokuma. Secondly, although
in the example above six out of twelve cases of fricative-plosive were stated to he of
recent origin, at least one of the others has to be assigned to Proto-Ijo. Further, other
show that the number of fricative-plosive combinations has actually been
reduced by conditioned sound-change. I t therefore seems improbable that there was ever
rigid a limitation on consonant combinations as there is on vowels.
1.4.5 A comparatively small number of Kolokuma units contain more than two
consonants. Of the polysyllables that do occur, the greater number belong to the syntactic
class of ideophones or descriptive verbs, which will he specially considered in 1.5below.
For the present they will he treated like other polysyllables, except that in the case of
reduplicated forms only the first half of the unit is considered.
206 units, each containing three consonants, were examined. 27 combinations of
*losive, fricative and sonorant are possible, and the number of units taking each combination is shown in Table 7.of the various consonants. (The text frequency has not been studied.)T ~ L5BczCombmedc1r 140

the following ways:
Many of the special phonological features noted for Ij? ideophones are similar to those described
in huo recent studies of Bantu ideophones:

verbs (Vmove), which are optionally followed by the directional suffix -mQ 'towards',and
which then take an object. A second classification crosscutting this one divides verbs into
thrce major groups according to the type of causative construction they function in
(Vcs.1, Vcs.2, Vcs.3). Finally, verbs are classified according to whether they form a
noun identical in shape with the verb (Vnom), or whether they form a nominalization
with baras 'way, -ness' (Vbara).","[20, 21]"

5. f v are labiodental fricatives.
6 . [s z] are, for bilingual speakers, in free variation with [J d31 in forms borrowed
from English:
[Iligi] or [sligi] ssdgi sugar
[ind3?ni] or [idni] inzini engine.
The question arises of the point at which new phones introduced through loanwords are
to be treated as phonemes. Two phonemes 1,j could he set u p in forms where there is
alternation, s and z being restricted to forms which do not show the variation. But the
fact that speakers make such statements as: 'We don't have J in our language', and 'Our
language should not be spelt Jjo; it should be Tzqn' suggest that a phoneme j is not yet
have not been heard;
recognized by Roloknma speakers. (Similar statements about
this probably rcflects two facts: (a) it is less common, and (b) it is not represented by a
single graph in English spelling.)
The use of [I], [d3] in sucb words is comparable to the use by educated English speakers
of [XI, varying with [k], in German names like Bach. For many English speakers, there
are styles of speech where [k] in these forms would be unacceptable, and where i t is
consequently hard to avoid phonemicizing x. It is, on the othcr hand, doubtful whether
there are styles of spcech in Kolokuma where [s], [z] are unacceptable in loanwords.
(The status situation is interesting; English has for long had prestige as the mark of
education, but there is now a nationalistic tendency, particularly among young men, to
condemn the use of English loanwords and to note, if not definitely to disparage, phones
like [d3] as 'English'.)
On the whole, therefore, it is preferable not to set u p /J/, /j/ at present, but a change in
the system could easily come about at this point.
7. h is required only to account for the interjection eh6& 'oho!' If a separate phonological system or subsystem is set up to describe interjections, h is not necessary to the
main system.[nI9A GRAMMAR O F THE K O L O K U M A D I A L E C T O F J J O8. Some speakers in some stylcs have one more phoneme not included in Table 3: a
very weak voiced velar fricative gh. It occurs in only four forms, three of which are very
common: -gh? 'locative', -gha 'negative', -gh6m+e 'past tense before reported speech'.
If these were the only cases, [y] could be set u p as the allophone of g or h that follows
hyphen juncture. But it also occurs in isaghik 'cottonwood', so that in intervocalic
position it contrasts with both g and h.
I n most contexts gh is segmentally zero for most spealcers; those who use [y] at all
apparently do so only when it is emphasized. T h e fact that gh is written in the orthography no doubt encourages the use of [y] in reading aloud. I n this study the speech of
those who do not use gh has been followed. T h e three common forms given above are
thus written -?, -a, -am&. Each is preceded by a new syllable onset, which is phonologically interpreted as a featurc of hyphen juncture preceding a vowel.
9. w r y are treated as a set because they all become nasalized in the vicinity of a nasal
(1.3.').
10. r is usually a single flap, but is apparently fricative for at least some speakers. I t
occurs initially only in the rare word riti* 'frame on which yams are tied for storage'
(probably a loanword), and in free variation with an initial vowel in riril or iriril 'feeling
of sorrow'. English loanwords normally acquire an initial vowel: or@]., 'rice', or6dA4
'Rhoda'.
11. m n q have already been noted to nasalize vowels in their vicinity (I .3 .z).
12. q occurs initially in the unit only after hyphen juncture in the single form -9jmj or
-gj 'future tense'. Otherwise it occurs only as second consonant (i.e. when another
consonant has already occurred in the unit), and is often in free variation with nasalization of the preceding and following vowels: bHq/
b q n 'run'; but only yeqi 'mother'.
13. 1 is always a clear variety.","[13, 14]"

3.3 INTRODUCTION
OF akjz 'USE'3.3.1 T h e constituent sentence contains an object followed by akjz 'take, use'; the
general meaning of the transformation is 'use something to do something', 'do something
with something'.",[30]
"INTRODUCTIONThese dialects are closely related and mutually intelligible. Boma scores 59.1% with
~(alabari and 64.6% with Nembe; these figures are not significantly different from the
66.8% it scores with Kabo (North-Western group), although the 70.8% it scores with
IColokuma is significantly different from the Kalabari-Boma figure. T h e percentages
suggest a transitional dialect, a result to be expected in view of the fact that this group
is situated geographically between the Nembe, North-Western, and South-Western
groups.
B. North-Eastern:
r . Okordia, spoken by the small Okordia clan on Taylor Creek.
z. Amegi (Biseni), spokcn by Amegi-Biseni clan, who live to the north of Okordia on
Taylor Creek.
These two dialects are very divergent from the other groups, no doubt because of their
isolated position and their intensive contact with dialects of the Edo and Igbo clusters.
Amegi has certain features reminiscent of Kalabari, with wbich it has bad contact;
Okordia is intermediate between the North-Central group and Amegi, but nearer to the
latter. No lexicostatistic comparisons with other groups have yet been made.
C. North-Central:
I . Gbanran, spoken by the Gbanran clan along Taylor Creek to the south of Okordia.
z . Elcpetiama, spoken by Ekpetiama clan along the Nun River. Ikibiri, although
politically part of this clan, is tcntativcly assigned to the North-Western group below.
3. Kolokuma, spoken by the large Kolokuma-Opokuma clan, who live mainly along
t h e N u n to the north of Ekpetiama.
These three dialects are fully mutually intelligible. On the Swadesh zoo-word list,
Kolokuma scores 79.1% with Kabo (North-Western), 70.8% with Boma, 65.2% with
Nembe, and 62.4% with Kalabari. These figures are not significantly different, but
would he so if the intermediate dialect of Boma were omitted. T h e existence of such
intermediate dialects is the reason for spealung of Ijg as one language and not as a group.",[5]

1.8 NOTEON THE CONVENTIONAL ORTHOGRAPIIY
The present orthography is quite inadequate to represent the phonological system of
Kolokuma. Only seven vowels are distinguished: i e e a ? o u are marked as in the
present transcription, but i is represented by i , e , or q, and (1 by 9, o, or u. Consequently,
the vowel-harmony system is not apparent in the orthography. No tones are marked; to
avoid some of the ambiguities this leads to, there are a certain number of arbitrary
spellings: e.g. the first and second person singular pronouns, which are distinguished
only by tone and both contain the same vowel, are written i 'I' (=/I) and e 'you' (=ia)
respectively. Consonants are marked as in the present work, except that JI is written ng,
g h is written as noted in 1.4.2, section 8, and the sequences nb, ngb are written rnb.
rngb. Word division is inconsistent and does not appear to follow any well-established
principles.",[19]
"Ikeni idika, a rnQ e r i - d y !
it is a hyena she has seen!)1.0.5 T h e term UNIT was suggested by Rowlands' TONAL UNIT;as used here, however,
it is a unit for phoneme distribution, vowel harmony and nasalization as well as for tone.
Units usually coincide with morphemes (k6roa 'fall'); the few exceptions consist of units
where two or more morphemes are recognizable but do not function individually in
respect of tone (k6rorn~z'make fall, throw': k6ro2 'fall'+ =rn? 'causative'). Because of
these few cases, the term M O R P H E ~has been kept as a grammatical one and is not used
on the phonological level. Since the grammar does not distinguish morphology and
syntax, the term WORD has not been required at the grammatical levcl and is therefore
used at the phonological level only.
1.0.6 T h e term TONE GROUP is equivalent to Rowlands' TONAL GROUP and is preferred
only as being slightly simpler. Tone groups are of crucial importance for the description
of tone patterns (1.7.1, 7.1). They are not, however, delimited by junctures, because in
certain circumstances they are linked into larger sequences, for which the tcrm TONE
PHRASE is reserved.

Three pronouns, the second person singular and plural, and the third person singular
feminine, belong to this class in all Eolms except the long pronoun and prevocalic short
forms. Another pronoun, the first person plural, belongs to this class in its posses,ive and short subject forms.
Class I11 has the same tone patterns in isolation or initial position as class 11, except
that there are no units with initial high vowel:
li3
oil palm
wirjs
house
biras
hand
akQs
be bitter
ali,
be far
in6qi3
be deaf
There are no pronouns in class 111.
Class IV has a great variety of tone patterns in isolation or initial position; it is the class
that serves for all units that do not fit into one of the other classes, such as loans from
English in which the stressed syllable is interpreted as high tone:
m64

Four pronouns, the second person singular and plural, the third person feminine singular,
and the first person plural belong to this class in their long pronoun and prevocalic short
object forms, the first person plural also in its preconsonantal short object form. No verbs
have been found in this class.
Class V, the low class, contains the following units, which are low-high in isolation
but low-low in initial position:
beke5

?ndv~
TOthese must be added the long pronoun and prevocalic object forms of three pronouns,
first person singular, third person masculine singular and third person plural; there are
no other known members of this class.
In some idiolects, however, this unit appears to be of class I129A G R A M M A R O F T H E K O L O K U M A D I A L E C T O F IJO1.7.3 There are six main types of enclitics and finals. There are both enclitic and final
membcrs of the first three types; types 4 and 5 contain only finals and type 6 only enclitics. All types except I and 6 are cited with a base tone pattern; all modifications
to these base patterns are given in chapter 7. Types I and 6 are cited without a base tone
pattern, because type I is largely and type 6 wholly conditioned by what precedes. (Type
6, in fact, behaves exactly like a free unit except that it never occurs in init~alposition in
a tone group and therefore cannot he assigned to a tone class.)

"3.1.6 A specific verb of motion, dass z , is introduced between an object and its transitive verb. Superficially, it looks as if the verb of motion is transitive, since it is immediately preceded by an object; but there are no kernel sentences of the type:
""eri, wiri wen[-mi

he walked the house.
The derivation is:

"11. CENTRAL
As noted above, dialects here are less sharply differentiated than in the East. Each
clan, consisting of several small towns strung along a river or creek, speaks a slightly
different dialcct and understands those of its neighbonrs. Probably all Central dialects
are largely mutually intelligible; they are not mutually intelligible with South-Eastern
dialects.
T h e following classification of Central dialects into five groups is based on a few
simple isoglosses and may be modified. I t is not easy to find bundles of isoglosses in this
area, where dialect difference is closely correlated with geographical distance.
A. South-Central:
I . Bassan, spoken by the Bassan clan, who live in the most western coastal arcas of the
Eastern Region. T h e dialcct of their neighbours, the Apoi clan, is probably also in the
group.
z. Boma (B""mg), spoken by the large Boma clan to the east of Bassan.
3. Olodiama, spoken by the small Olodiama clan, sandwiched in between the northern
parts of Bassan and Boma.
4. Oporoma, spoken by the Oporoma clan to the north of Boma.
Following I. Dyen, 'The lexicostatistical classification of the Malayopolynesian languages',
(1962), B significant difference between two percentages is taken as roughlyLANGUAGE 38.38-46
10%.",[5]

sentence serving as a noun modifier is either a short pronoun or a possessive. (When not
preceding a demonstrative, only a possessive is possible: M.6-7.)
{Ine}bei k+ri-gi-d.i wari-bi6.0 Morphophonemic iules are written with the single arrow, but are quite different in
form from phrase-structure rules. On the left, each string begins with X and ends with
Y; in between are the elements which are to be rewritten, marked off by commas, and
next to them the relevant environment. On the right-hand side only the central part,
corresponding to the portion which on the left is betwecn commas, is rewritten; the
environment, which does not change, is to be read as identical with its statement on the
left. Extra unspecified elements in the environment, when required, are noted as X', etc.
T h e rules in this chapter are those which deal with the adjustment of morphs in strings,
omitting tonal rules, which are dealt with in the last chapter.
Morphophonemic rules are obligatory unless stated optional.","[46, 47]"
