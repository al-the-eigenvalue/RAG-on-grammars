object followed by subject, the subject occasionally precedes the object in sentences
where both constituents are overtly expressed, especially when there is no ambiguity as to
which element is the subject and which is the object. See 1.10, where the verbs ma' ‘to

Constituent order is useful (but not foolproof) in distinguishing subject, direct object and
indirect object (in each of which only third person may be overtly expressed). The basic
order of constituents in a transitive/ intransitive clause is verb, object (or object-like
argument), subject; in a ditransitive clause, it is verb, direct object, indirect object,
subject—see 1.2.1.2. However, as noted in section 1.2.1.2.6, order may vary, so
referencing of the grammatical relation on the VIC or NIC is a more reliable means for
distinguishing NP functions. Most clauses do not have overtly expressed subjects or
objects; they are simply expressed in the VICS. Many clauses have only one overtly
expressed constituent (subject or object), while both are expressed in the VIC, and in
these clauses, word order is not sufficient to determine whether the constituent is subject
or object, and ambiguity can result. The postverbal modifier pan, marking subject
emphasis, or the use of alternate VICS (i.e. passive or reciprocal mor-phemes) can help
disambiguate such structures—see 1.11.2.1.2 and 1.7. Sometimes ambiguity cannot be
avoided and can only be resolved by context.
2.1.1.1.6. Derivational processes
Derived nouns can function as the subject (385a), direct object (385b), or oblique object
of the verb (385c). They can also function as nominal modifiers, much the same way that
-xi' nouns do (385d).

"Wari'56(c) Only the last syllable of the embedded sentence carries primary stress, just as the last
syllable of a verb compound carries primary stress. (This would violate the normal
stress rule that places primary stress on the final syllable of each word, were it not for
the fact that the embedded sentence is now a single verb.)
The matrix clause of verbalized sentences is not marked in any special way. In general,
any of the Tense or Tenseless verbal inflectional clitics may be used. Restrictions on their
use, as well as the basic structure of each verbalized sentence type, are described below.

Only realis past/present verbal inflectional clitics can be used in the matrix clause, and
only third person realis future VICS can be used in the derived predicate. The subject
marked in the derived predicate is always coreferential with the object marked in the
matrix clause.
The embedded clause may contain an NP subject or an NP direct object but not both.
If an NP direct object appears in the embedded clause, then an NP subject may not appear
there—see (100g–h). A VIC within the embedded clause, referencing the subject, is
always obligatory however. This embedded VIC coreferences the object of the matrix
clause, whether it is overt or merely understood. Since the postverbal modifier ma'
belongs to the class of postverbal modifiers that do not carry stress when occurring in a
verb compound, the last syllable of the word preceding it carries primary stress—see

the functions that operator words signal, the basic structure of COMP sentences, and the
ways various concepts of question words are expressed.

occur, though rarely. It is, however, possible to construct a (rather unnatural) sentence
with up to four phrases in addition to the verb, as seen in the examples in (14) below:

"Morphology2212.1.1.2.2. Subject of transitive verb
The subject of a transitive verb is (usually) marked on the VIC. Third person subject may
also be overtly expressed by an NP—see 1.2.1.2.1. The number of the subject of a
transitive verb does not govern plural marking on the verb—see 2.3.1.6.1.1. The form of
the overtly expressed subject of a transitive verb is the same as that of an overtly
expressed direct object, unless there is an indirect object in the sentence, in which case
the (erstwhile) direct object occurs in a prepositional phrase—see 1.2.1.2.3.1. When both
subject and object are overtly expressed, the subject almost always follows the object—
see 1.2.1.2.6. There is no distinction between subjects of transitive verbs as agent and
nonagent.
2.1.1.2.3. Subject of copular constructions
Copular constructions do not exist, but see 1.2.1.1, for what we consider a functionally
similar 'ON construction.
2.1.1.2.4. Direct object
The direct object is optionally marked on the VIC. Third person object may also be
overtly expressed by an NP. When an indirect object is in the sentence, whether overtly
expressed or merely marked in the VIC, the direct object may be referenced by an
inflected preposition (or simply understood from context)—see 1.2.1.2.2–3. There is no
change in the form of the overtly expressed object when the subject is not overtly
expressed. Like the subject of intransitive verbs, the object of transitive verbs governs
number agreement on the verb—see 2.1.3.6.2–4.
2.1.1.2.5. Indirect object
See 1.2.1.2.3.
2.1.1.2.6. Object of comparison
Comparison is expressed by means of juxtaposed sentences that show contrasts. The
object of comparison is often the subject or object of such verbs as tiquin' mao ‘to go on’,
tiquin' ca' ‘to pass up’ and juc 'in pin ‘to push away’ in the last of the contrasting
sentences—see 1.1.2.4.2.7.
2.1.1.2.7. Object of equation
Equation is expressed by means of the verb 'an xiho' ‘to imitate’ (387a) or by verb 'ac ‘to
be like’ occurring as the leftmost member of a compound with a noun or emphatic
pronoun (387b–c), or as the operator word in the verbalized comparative clause described
in 1.1.1.4.3.3.6.

with the ‘dubitative’ particle in the matrix clause. The choice of the singular or plural
VIC in the matrix clause is determined by the number of persons addressed. This
construction could be loosely translated, in addition to the derived predicate, as ‘…and
you better believe it’, or ‘…you can say that again’. Primary stress falls on the verb na.

tense/mood of sequential sentences is found in the verbal inflectional clitic of the matrix
clause. Only third person singular Tense verbal inflectional clitics (na ‘realis
past/present’, tara ‘realis future’, or xira ‘irrealis’) may occur in the matrix clause. The
choice of 'ac ‘to travel’ or mao ‘to go (s)’ in the derived predicate seems to be based on
idiolectical preference.
When there is an overt object or subject of the sentence, it usually follows the derived
predicate, just as the object or subject follows the verb of a simple sentence; however,
about 50 per cent of the time, the overt object may occur inside the derived predicate of
verbalized sequential sentences, in which case its last syllable carries primary stress. The
overt subject never occurs inside the derived predicate of verbalized sequential sentences.
Whether the overt object occurs inside or outside the derived predicate seems to be a
choice of stylistic preference. The use of the verbalized sequential sentence is a common
way to begin a narrative discourse. The derived predicate is italicized in the following

tense construction as a whole, since the subject marked in the derived predicate and that
marked in the matrix clause are always coreferential (this contrasts with an indirect
speech interpretation (see 1.1.1.1), in which the subject of the derived predicate is always
coreferential with the object of the matrix clause). The subject NP must occur externally,

"0.4. COMP AND INFL
In Everett (1994), considerable space is spent railing against the notion of basic word
order. We thus avoid this term here as inaccurate both in its use of ‘basic’, as opposed to
pragmatically unmarked or syntactically underlying, and its use of ‘word’, as opposed to
constituent. The pragmatically unmarked constituent order in 'ON is vos. We do not here
consider underlying constituent order at all, aside from some brief and highly speculative
remarks in section 2.2 in the main body of the grammar. There are two basic
configurations in which vos can appear, however. The first configuration is what we call
‘simple sentences’, those in which v is the first constituent. These have the shape in (f)
(where SFP= sentence-final particle):
(f)V VIC (NPOBJ1) (PP/NPOBJ2) (NPSUBJ) (SFP)The VIC in this configuration is almost always tensed. If it is not tensed, then tense may
appear nowhere else in the clause.
The other configuration in which vos appears is the COMP (=complementizer) clause,
as in (g) (INFL=inflectional morpheme):
(g)COMP INFL V VIC (NPOBJ1) (PP/NPOBJ2) (NPSUBJ) (SFP)Sentence-final particles express temporal notions and this label should thus be
straightforward and uncontroversial for all readers (assuming that they do not mind the
term ‘particle’). COMP and INFL, on the other hand, may not be so appealing to a
general readership, coming as they do from Government and Binding Theory (GB)
(Chomsky 1981,1986). Moreover, INFL itself is an outdated term in GB since at least
since Everett (1987), Pollock (1989), and Chomsky (1992) it has been assumed that what
was considered to be INFL, the head of an inflectional phrase (IP), should be instead
broken into the separate components of AGR (agreement) and T (tense). Nevertheless,
we believe that these two labels are useful mnemonic devices and that they serve better
than any others, barring detailed theoretical discussion, to express the function and syntax
of these morphemes/nodes in 'ON grammar.
INFL expresses tense and realis/irrealis mood and agrees in gender with any material
in COMP, whether overt or covert (i.e. merely understood). Thus INFL is not exclusively
a tense/mood morpheme nor does it express the expected type of agreement with a major
grammatical relation, since it agrees with COMP, not with subject or object. Therefore,
we did not feel that it could be adequately labelled by either ‘tense’ or ‘(COMP)
agreement’. We thus stick with our label INFL here. Since such a preverbal
morpheme/clitic is extremely rare at best, no standard term will work as well as, certainly
no better than, INFL in our opinion. Thus readers may interpret our use of these terms asWari'8either merely a label for a specific 'ON construction or as a GB-related claim about the
relationship between 'ON phrase structure to Universal Grammar (UG), as they wish.
Two kinds of information appear in COMP: words which indicate moods other than
(ir)realis and question words. These thus correspond neatly to the core function predicted
of COMP in GB theory, aside from the fact that only one COMP word, the ‘third person
singular neuter’ form of the preposition, pain, serves exclusively to introduce subordinate
clauses. (For GB-oriented readers, we analyse the COMP word as occurring in the SPEC
of COMP position and INFL as, at the surface only, the head of COMP.)
When a COMP appears, INFL is obligatory and the VICS may not be marked for
tense/mood. This is simply accounted for if we assume that tense/mood ((ir)realis mood)
must always appear in the second position of the sentence. Agreement between INFL and
COMP is also obligatory, an additional reason for INFL to immediately follow COMP in
some theoretical frameworks.
The movement or appearance of subject or object in COMP occurs in leftdislocation/clefted sentences, in relative clauses and in wh- (or information) questions.
An item may only appear in COMP if it is potentially referenceable on the VIC in the
sentence in question (i.e. according to the hierarchy of semantic roles above). Thus a
theme cannot be questioned, relativized, or left-dislocated if a goal NP is expressed. A
location cannot be moved to COMP if a benefactive is expressed, and so on.
Interestingly, however, there is an Anti-agreement Effect observed with fronted objects.
The VIC may not agree with an object moved to COMP. Subjects moved to COMP,
however, require agreement on the VIC, just as in the nonmoved case.
1Note that we are using these as grammatical features only. If we were using these as ‘real world’
semantic values, the results would come out wrong, since many nonhuman items in the real world
may be masculine. The three genders, masculine, feminine and neuter, are simply our labels for
these feature combinations.","[20, 21]"

"2.2. DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY
2.2.1. Introduction
In this section, we deviate somewhat from the suggested outline in order to present more
effectively some of the highly unusual, perhaps unique, features of 'ON derivational
morphology. There are various derivational processes in the language, but two are worth
special mention here, since they are used to derive both nouns and verbs. These are zeroderivation and compounding. Other derivational processes, e.g. iteration and suffixation,
are discussed in the final subsections of this section. The process of zero-derivation is of
particular interest to all theoretical and typological morphologists, because by this
process words may be derived from sentences. This requires us to allow the derivational
morphological component of 'ON grammar to apply to both the input and output of
sentence formation, something which some syntactic and morphological theories predict
to be impossible. Compounding provides additional evidence for this claim. We are going
to argue too that all words in 'ON are left-headed, whether derived by inflectional or
derivational processes.
We have organized this section around derivational processes, rather than by the
categories which undergo these processes (e.g. N and V), since for the most part, the

COMP sentences are distinguished from simple and verbalized sentences by the
following criteria:
1 They have an overt expression in their sentence-initial position, or COMP, what we will
refer to as ‘operator words’ or ‘COMP words’.
2 An INFL morpheme usually follows the operator word. This is because Tense must
appear in second position of the sentence (with few exceptions, to be noted in the
course of our discussion)—see 2.1.8.2.5.
3 Tenseless VICS usually follow the verb in the VP (there are exceptions to this, noted in
the paragraph preceding (64) and the paragraph following (73)).
By ‘operator word’, we mean a word which sets the value of a particular logical
connective for the entire sentence, or which is interpreted logically as binding a variable
in the sentence. By ‘INFL’, we mean a preverbal word which gives information about
tense, mood and in some cases gender. That operator words are separate syntactic words,
and not prefixes, can be shown in information questions, where questioned NPS can be
placed between the operator word and INFL. Also, some operator words form
compounds with different nouns or demonstratives in preverbal positions, as shown in
some of the examples which follow ((68a), (73e–f), (74c), (82c–e)). This is also not
expected if these are prefixes. We analyse INFL as a separate morpheme, because the
language otherwise lacks prefixes, although nothing crucial for our descriptive task here
hinges on this.
There are ten COMP words in 'ON that appear in matrix or embedded clauses, and
one, pain, that serves exclusively to introduce subordinate clauses. Some of these COMP
words also interact with certain pre-/post-verbal modifiers and verbs in order to express
different types of interrogation. These COMP words select for specific INFL morphemes
to accompany them, as discussed below. COMP words occur elsewhere in the language
in different word classes, as shown in Table 1.1, where we list each COMP word with its
basic meaning as well as the function it signals as a COMP word—see also 2.2.2.3.
‘Interrogation’ means question-word interrogation.
Three operator words (mo, 'ac, and 'ane) can occur only with declarative intonation;
four (mon, mam, main and cain') can occur only with interrogative intonation (see,
however, 1.2.1.1, where mon, mam and main also appear with declarative intonation in
copular-type sentences); and four ma', 'om, je and pain) can occur with either declarative
or interrogative intonation. Table 1.2 illustrates this. When ma' occurs with interrogative
intonation, it asks a question-word question; when 'om and pain occur with interrogative
intonation, they ask a yes-no question; when je occursWari'42Table 1.1 COMP operator words: form and function

There are five INFL morphemes in 'ON. They appear in INFL following COMP in
COMP sentences: ca ‘neuter realis past/present’, co ‘masculine/ feminine realis
past/present’, ‘iri’ ‘realis past/present’, ta ‘realis future’, and xi ‘irrealis’. Since INFL
morphemes express tense/mood in COMP sentences (and elsewhere, in noun and relative
clauses), they may not co-occur with a Tense VIC, except as mentioned in the following
paragraph. See also 1.1.2.2 and 1.1.2.3 below. INFL morphemes indicate the gender of
the (overt or covert) word or phrase in COMP.
While Tenseless VICS are usually the only VICS which appear in COMP sentences,
the Tense third person realis past/present VICS must occur when a masculine/feminine
subject is referenced in COMP (whether overt or covert; this does not necessarily hold for
relative clauses—see the discussion on relative clauses in 1.1.2.3, where it is shown that
in some cases, no VIC follows the verb. See also (64d) below). So, for example, a Tense
VIC is required when questioning a masculine/feminine subject, which always involvesSyntax43an overt COMP word (64a–b), or when relativizing the masculine/feminine subject,
which always involves a covert COMP (64c–d).

There are two classes of inflectional clitics: (1) verbal inflectional clitics, or VICS, which
are marked for person, number and, in some cases, tense/ mood and third person gender
of subjects and objects—see 2.1.3.6.2.2; and (2) possessive nominal inflectional clitics,
or NICS, which mark person, number, and third person gender, appear in derived nouns
and may also follow unpossessed nouns—see 2.1.1.4.6.
1.16.9. Particles
Particles are simple (i.e. phonological) clitics that generally occur at or near the end of
the sentence—see 2.1.8.
1.16.10. INFL morphemes
INFL morphemes cliticize to the verb in COMP sentences, noun clauses and derived
nouns (see 2.1.8.1.9) and express tense/mood and sometimes gender of the element in
COMP (whether overt or covert).
1.16.11. Operator words
Operator words are a small class of words that appear in COMP in COMP sentences—
see 2.1.8.1.10.
1.16.12. Ideophones
Ideophones are onomatopoeic words that express the sound of actions. Many ideophones
deviate from phonological norms of the language: (1) some employ phonological units
not found elsewhere in the language; (2) vowels are often exaggeratedly lengthened; and
(3) varied intonation is often employed: high, low, whispered, etc. See 4.1.","[229, 230]"

na-pa'press:downupon3s:rp/p-1s‘He feels sorry for (lit. presses down upon) me.’Such semantic drift is expected under a compounding analysis, but not under a
suffixation nor a serial verb analysis.
Phonologically, a string of independent words would receive stress on each word in
the string. In the verbs above, however, this is not the case. Primary stress is placed only
on the final verb of the string (with the verbs to the left receiving very light secondary
stresses at most). If these form a single compound verb (or affixed verb), this is to be
expected. It is harder to account for by a serial verb analysis. (At least it is less
economical, since we need compounding already to handle semantically opaque cases
like those in (737), and the ‘serial verb’ construction would be formally identical.)
Syntactically, the verbs in a serial verb construction should share the same subject.
That is not the case here, however, if we merely take the literal meaning of each verb:

does not go anywhere. It is the son that is doing the going in (738), not the speaker. At
the same time, however, the speaker is not causing the son to go, so a simple causative
analysis would miss the mark. A compound analysis can handle this by assuming that the
second verb is the result or object of the first, forming a single complex event of seeing
and going of which the subject is the ‘seer’ (because as leftmost verb, ‘see’ will be the
head of the compound and thus determine the subject of the verb, while the subject of
‘go’, the son, will be the object of the compound verb). In other words, while this has the
superficial form of a causative, it is in fact a new, compound verb. Consider the case of a
plural object:

The subject of an intransitive verb is (usually) marked on the VIC. (The VIC is
sometimes deleted in series of actions in discourses.) Third person subject may also be
overtly expressed by an NP—see 1.2.1.2.1. Like the direct object of a transitive verb, the
subject of an intransitive verb governs the number agreement on suppletive or
reduplicated verb forms: a plural intransitive subject requires the plural form of the
intransitive verb (a plural object requires the plural form of a transitive verb)—see
2.1.3.6.1.1. There is no distinction between subjects of intransitive verbs as agent or
nonagent.",[233]

clause constituents cannot be questioned. In what follows, we illustrate the way
information from the various types of subordinate clauses can be questioned. But none of
these involves actual question-word formation. We have already seen that question words
may not remain in situ but that they must appear sentence-initial, i.e. in the COMP
position. If we assume that question words must appear in the matrix COMP but that
movement out of subordinate clauses is prohibited, we derive the fact that subordinate
clause constituents cannot be questioned. Let us now turn to consider how information
from subordinate clauses can be questioned.
We begin first with verbalized or direct speech sentences.
(i) Verbalized (direct speech type) sentences
Direct objects, indirect objects and subjects of verbalized (direct speech type) sentences
(supposition, direct speech and future tense), such as those found in (16), (17) and (18)
may be inquired about, as shown in (16) to (18). If the matrix clause is expressed, then
only the entire purpose clause may be questioned, as in (19).

have a less intense, or singular, and a more intense, or plural form. The number of the
subject of intransitive verbs and the object of transitive verbs is marked via the use of the
more intense, or plural form. So although the plural number of a nonhuman noun is not
marked on the VIC, if the verb has an intense, or plural form, the number of the subject
or object can nevertheless be marked by its use—see 2.1.1.9.3.

3.2.3.2. Word-initial vowels
No vowels occur word-initially.
3.2.3.3. Sequences of (syllabic) vowels
There are no sequences of syllabic vowels in the language in mono-morphemic words.
Vowel sequences are realized as surface diphthongs.
3.2.4. Differences between structure of lexical morphemes and words
While /ſ/ never occurs word-initially in regular words, it does occur initially in verbal
inflectional clitics. In these cases, however, it is still utterance-medial—see 3.2.1.2.
While the minimal construction of words is either cv or cvc, there are a few lexical
morphemes in the form of suffixes that have a vc, vcvc, or simply c construction. Vowel
harmony, or the formation of a diphthong reduces the resulting combinations, however,
to a normal cvc pattern. A few examples:

1.16.1. Noun
Nouns may be distinguished by the following morphological criteria: (i) they may bear
possessive suffixes or NICS—see 2.1.1.4.6; and (ii) they may be followed by any one of
the spatial/temporal demonstratives—see 1.2.5.2.5 (note that only two of the
demonstratives, ca' ‘this (neuter) proximate to speaker’ and ma' ‘that proximate to
hearer’, and one of the temporal demonstratives, cara ‘absent’, though without its
accompanying temporal particle, may follow a verb). Besides these morphological
characteristics, the following syntactic criteria apply to nouns: (iii) they may appear alone
as subject or object of the verb, (iv) they may appear as the complement of a form of the
preposition—see 1.2.4; and (v) they may occur in sequence with another noun in a
possessed NP, in which the second element (possessor) can be any noun except a derived
noun, and the first NP is marked by the possessive marking suffixes or NICS referred to
above (functioning semantically as either an actually possessed element or a nominal
modifier—see 1.2.5.2.3).
1.16.2. Pronoun
There are two classes of pronouns: (1) demonstrative and (2) emphatic.
(1) The demonstrative pronoun is a subclass of nouns. It satisfies three of the syntactic
criteria that define the noun: (i) it may appear by itself as the subject or object of the verb;Wari'216(ii) it may appear by itself as the complement of a form of the preposition; and (iii) it may
appear as the second element (possessor) of a possessed NP. It is different from
nonpronominal nouns, however, in that it cannot be suffixed or postposed by an NIC or
possessive marking suffix, nor can it be followed by a demonstrative.
(2) The emphatic pronoun is not a subclass of nouns. It cannot occur by itself as the
subject or object of the verb, nor can it appear as the complement of a form of the
preposition. It is marked by its potential to occur alone (in the case of first and second
person) or in apposition to a noun or demonstrative pronoun (in the case of third person)
in coordinate constructions (see 1.3.3) or to express emphasis (see 1.11.2.1.3).
1.16.3. Verb
The verb is the main predicate constituent of all major sentence types. It is marked by the
following morphological criteria: (i) its potential to be compounded with a verbal
modifier or with another verb; and (ii) that it may be followed by verbal inflectional
clitics. There are two additional subclasses of verbs, which we label verbal modifiers.
These are like main verbs, except they may only occur in compounded verbs (see 1.16.7).
There are usually slight semantic differences in the meanings of verbs when compounded
in nonhead position.
1.16.4. Nominal modifier
Nominal modifiers do not occur as a separate word class. See 1.16.1.
1.16.5. Preposition
The preposition is marked by its function as the head of the prepositional phrase, which
may occur as any nonsubject argument of the verb. It can occur alone (inflected for the
person, number and gender of its object) or with a complement, which may be a simple
noun or derived noun—see 1.2.4.","[228, 229]"

"0.2. MORPHOLOGY
0.2.1. Word classes
The major word classes and the only open word classes in 'ON are Verb and Noun. Loan
words, for example, must enter the language as nouns or verbs (most frequently as verbs),
regardless of their word class in the source language. However, there are several minor
word classes, including inflectional clitics, subdivisions of nouns and verbs,
demonstrative and emphatic pronouns, and a single preposition, all of which we will
briefly discuss in this overview.
0.2.2. Nouns
Nouns occur in argument and adjunct positions in the clause and trigger agreement on a
preceding preposition or verbal inflectional clitic (VIC). They may also trigger agreement
on a nominal inflectional clitic (NIC), following the possessor noun. Nouns trigger
agreement for person, number and gender. Since only nouns referring to humans may
trigger number agreement, number can be understood as a dependant of the feature
[+human]. Genders are feminine (for human females only), masculine (for human males
or certain animals, fish and bird species) and neuter (for most plants and inanimate
objects). This gives us the values and groups in Table 0.1, according to the grammatical
features [human] and [female]:Table 0.1 Grammatical feature combinations
FEMININENONFEMININE[+HUMAN, +FEMALE][−FEMALE]=MASCULINE
[−HUMAN]=NEUTERThis is an interesting gender distribution, since it does not involve simple conjunctions of
values for the feature pair [human] and [female]. Only human females are marked by
both features, producing the first division. In the second major division, nonfemale, the
features are opposed equipollently rather than privatively. Some nouns in the lexicon will
be marked [+ human, + female], others [−human], and still others merely [−female].1 In
mixed groups, masculine gender is always overridden:
(a)masculine+feminine=feminine(b)masculine+neuter=neuterAs is seen in the main body of the grammar, neuter and feminine are never mixed, nor are
all three genders ever conjoined in a single NP.",[15]

Any NP may be emphasized by increased loudness and higher pitch on the head of the

postverbal modifier pan. If emphasis is desired on both subject and object
simultaneously, the subject will be marked by pan and the object by increased loudness

preceding a relative clause. See 1.11.2.1.1–3.

addition to coding object number by the correct choice of the object affix, it can also be
coded by the correct choice of the form of the verb, if it is one of the transitive verbs that
has a singular and plural form. In contrast to intransitive verbs, where both human and
nonhuman plural subjects must be indicated, when possible, by the plural form of the
verb, transitive verbs do not always require the use of plural forms to indicate plural
objects. The plural form of transitive verbs can clarify the number of the object, but it
also describes the scope of the action. Less intense actions of a shorter duration tend to be
marked by singular forms, while more intense actions of a longer duration tend to be
marked by plural forms. The choice of the singular or plural form of the verb in these
situations depends on how the speaker views the situation; it is largely subjective.

uncommon. We have observed the following combinations:

"Paramana'xujuhu'?thereforeangryrefl:2p‘Why are you angry with each other (or yourselves)?’The postverbal modifier caracan ‘each other’ is often used in conjunction with the
reflexive (reciprocal) VICS to explicitly express reciprocality.
(332)Mana'caracanxequequem.angryeach:otherrefl:3pf‘They are angry with each other.’Reciprocals, reflexives, and passive constructions all share a common discourse
function—they reduce the topicality difference between the agentas-subject and the
object-as-patient (goal, theme, etc.). The passive (see 2.1.3.1.1) does this by promoting
the agreement expressed as an object in the active construction to the subject of the
passive. The agent is removed, i.e. is not expressed overtly, in a passive clause.
Reciprocals and reflexives reduce the topicality of the agent-as-subject by equating agent
with the object upon which it acts in the VIC. That is, a reflexive/reciprocal VIC
eliminates the subject-object distinction by failing (like the passive, but unlike the active)
to distinguish between subject and object in agreement. Since 'ON lacks case marking
and only distinguishes between subject and (primary) object via the VIC (other objects
are marked by the preposition), obliteration of any subject-object VIC distinction
effectively means that subject=object topically and semantically. This in effect increases
the relative prominence of nonsubject arguments. So for example, in (333), the duck
referenced by con ‘prep:3sm’ is the topic of the paragraph from which (333) was taken.
In the (embedded) clause in which it occurs, there is no distinctive reference to the
subject, only the reflexive VIC.

(704) e.cami'pinnucunINFL:nrp/pgivecompletelyposs:3sm‘his death’Examples like (704d) involve two levels of zero-derivation. First, tarama' ‘man’
undergoes zero-derivation to form a verb, ‘to (be a) man’ or ‘to grow’. Next, it and ca
undergo zero-derivation to form a noun, to which is attached the NIC, nexi' ‘possessive1pincl’. The question which arises with regard to these examples is the nature of the
constituent formed by the INFL+verb unit which undergoes zero-derivation. It does not
seem possible to merely analyse the INFL morpheme as a prefix on the verb for two
important reasons. First, this would leave us with no account for the fact that ca must
precede the verb in order to guarantee that tense be the second constituent in the clause.
Second, this would fail to account for the fact that in normal matrix and subclauses, the
gender information on the INFL morpheme does not agree with the subject or object per
se, but with the content of the COMP node.
Consider the first problem, i.e. the requirement that tense always appear as the second
constituent of the clause. If tense/mood were a verbal affix, it would be the second
constituent of the clause whenever its ‘host’, the v, followed overt COMP. But it would
be the first constituent whenever the verb appeared in initial position, whether or not it
was prefixed or suffixed to the verb, since notions like first or second constituent cannot
‘look through layers’. That is, the restriction cannot be ‘second morphological or
syntactic constituent’, it must be one or the other. In fact, for 'ON, it must be ‘second
syntactic constituent’ because when question phrases appear in COMP (see 1.1.1.4.2
above on information questions), the INFL morpheme may not intervene between them,
meaning that tense must be the second phrasal constituent (we assume that VICS are
generated outside the verb phrase in agreement phrases, AGRPS). As for the fact that
INFL agrees in gender with the material in COMP, we claim that this is because the
INFL morpheme heads the phrasal projection in which COMP occurs at surface structure
(i.e. it winds up in co position and information questions and other COMP material are in
the SPEC (=specifier) position of the COMP phrase (CP)). However, we shall not argue
here for these more abstract structures. Suffice it to say that the VICS never agree directly
with material in COMP, so that if INFL were a verbal prefix, it would be a very strange
one in that its gender is controlled by sentence-initial position rather than by standard
grammatical relations, e.g. subject and object.
But if INFL is not a verbal prefix, what is it? We will claim that it is the head of its
own Tense Phrase (TP) and that the verb adjoins to it. It is this INFL+v adjunctionWari'358structure which then undergoes zero-derivation to form a noun. The VICS, heading as
they do separate phrasal constituents under our analysis (AGRPS) can be omitted from
the scope of the nominalization rule. For readers who have an aversion to such
terminology, the bottom line is that we must allow INFL+v to form a constituent which
excludes the VICS but which does not merely analyse INFL as a prefix on the verb.
To head off a potential counteranalysis: we consider the forms in (704) above to be
derived from verbs plus INFL, rather than from subordinate clauses, because they do not
contain VICS or NP arguments. A possible objection to analysing these as derived nouns
(rather than phrases) might be raised on phonological grounds. In (705) below, the wordinitial glottal immediately following the INFL morpheme fails to delete. However, in the
formation of kinship terms, which are clearly used as individual nouns (see 2.2.2.2.1.5),
the glottal stop does delete in this same environment. However, we believe that kinship
terms are idiomatic, crystallized forms that have been reanalysed as single words, and
that they do not represent a productive word-formation process. Thus, they do not
prejudice our claims here.

"An overview of 'oro nao' grammar3Thus, Chapacuran is one of the rare language families in the Amazon which manifests
grammatical gender distinctions, the other families being Arawan and Arawakan.
However, contra Greenberg (1987), these families are not related, at least they share no
obvious cognates and the presence of gender is hardly a sufficiently reliable criterion
alone to posit any genetic affiliation (see Everett 1996).
Like many languages with rich agreement, in 'ON nouns usually only appear in
sentences to signal particular discourse functions and in isolated sentences to avoid
ambiguity. Otherwise, it is more common merely to reference participants in a
predication via VICS, NICS, or the inflected preposition wherever possible.
(Nonpronominal) nouns are not themselves marked for case, number, person or
gender. These features are discernible via agreement and certain verbal modificational
forms. There are two broad classes of nouns, -xi' nouns (so-called because their citation
form ends in -xi' 1pincl) and non-xi' nouns. Kinship terms form a third (closed), minor
class. Both -xi' nouns and kinship terms are inalienably possessed. The non-xi' nouns for
the most part all have -xi' forms as well. The non-xi' forms are themselves subdivided
into nonpossessable and possessable nouns. Non-xi' forms which may not be possessed
(although if they have a -xi' form they may be possessed in that form) are body parts,
exclusively. Optionally possessable non-xi' forms can be marked as possessed via NICS.
The distinction between -xi' vs non-xi' nouns is also important for the derivational
morphology since non-xi' nouns when zero-derived to form verbs usually form
attributive, nonactive verbs, whereas verbs zero-derived from -xi' nouns are almost
always active.
Although case is not overtly marked on nouns, the verbal inflectional clitic is sensitive
to the semantic role that the noun phrase bears in the clause, rigidly observing the
following hierarchy for object agreement (subject agreement is always obligatory,
regardless of the semantic role of the subject):
(c) GOAL>CIRCUMSTANCE>THEME>BENEFACTIVE>COMITATIVE>
LOCATION>TIMEThat is, if there is a GOAL in the clause, the object portion of the VIC must agree with it
(if there is also a theme, it is usually expressed as the object of the preposition, much as
Relational Grammar’s ‘3→2 Advancement’ would predict); if there is a circumstance
(but no goal) then it will be referenced on the VIC, and so on down the hierarchy, with
remaining roles usually expressed as prepositional objects.
0.2.3. Verbs
The class of verbs is the most productive word class in the language. Most adjectival
notions, as well as traditionally verbal meanings, are expressed as verbs. The majority of
loan words, regardless of the word class in the source language, enter Wari' as verbs.
Verbs may be either transitive, intransitive or ambitransitive, although the last class is
quite small. The last class, as one might expect, subdivides those where the intransitive
subject corresponds to the transitive object from those where the transitive subject
corresponds to the intransitive subject, with the verb for ‘turn over’ representing the first
class and the verb for ‘break’ the second class (e.g. ‘I turned over the baby’ vs ‘The baby
turned over’; ‘The man broke his arm’ vs ‘The man broke’). Perhaps the most remarkableWari'4fact about verbs in 'ON is the almost complete absence of verbal inflectional processes
alongside a rich set of derivational processes. Nouns, emphatic pronouns and sentences
may all form verbs via zero-derivation. Any verb, whether nonderived or derived
(including ‘desententialized’ verbs, i.e. verbs derived from sentences), may be
compounded to form new verbs or to increase transitivity. Verb compounding never
reduces the transitivity of the verb as a whole, which is set by the leftmost member of the
compound, which we analyse as the head of the compound.
There are two minor classes of verbs which we have labelled preverbal and postverbal
modifiers. These differ from main verbs in two ways, according to our analysis: (i) they
may never occur in the predicate outside of a compound; and (ii) some of the preverbal
modifiers may also modify nouns, in prehead position within the NP. Verbal compounds
are always constructed according to the following template (superscripts indicate number
of times a category can reoccur in a single sequence. No superscript means that there is
no reoccurrence allowed):
(d)preverbal modifier effect2 postverbal modifier2 initial action/cause resultEach effect/result is produced by the action of the verb (in its compound) to its immediate
left, suggesting an iconic principle of compound formation.
Verbs are uninflected by affixation, except for reduplication, which marks aspect.
There are various types of reduplication processes. One interesting aspect of
reduplication is that an inflectional (INFL) morpheme otherwise expected in a particular
clause will sometimes not co-occur with reduplication.
Aside from compounding, zero-derivation and reduplication, verb morphology in 'ON
is quite simple. Certainly it is one of the simplest morphological systems in Lowland
Amazonia. Nevertheless, this simplicity is deceptive since this language provides perhaps
the strongest evidence yet documented on the ability of the syntax to feed wordformation, in violation of certain theoretical proposals and frameworks, such as Lexical
Phonology.
Valency-reducing morphology is represented on the VIC, with special forms for
active, passive, and reflexive. But since VICS are not part of the verb word, these
inflectional processes are actually independent of the verb per se.
0.2.4. Preposition
'ON has a single preposition, obligatorily inflected for person, number and gender of its
object. It is required for definite NPS not referenced on the VIC, as per the hierarchy
given in (c) above, although it is optional for indefinite NPS, without regard to the
semantic role of the NP, subject only to the condition that it only appear with NPS not
referenced on the VIC.
0.2.5. Emphatic pronouns
There are emphatic pronouns for all grammatical person, number, and gender
combinations. These can only be used as zero-derived verbs, in left-dislocation position,
and as arguments of the verb, in which case they must be followed immediately by an
appositional noun further specifying their referent (usually a proper noun). First andAn overview of 'oro nao' grammar5second person emphatic pronouns may only be used as replies to questions or as
exclamations, in left-dislocated position, and in certain kinds of list structures. The first
person plural inclusive emphatic pronoun is wari', the autodenomination of the people.
Interestingly, there are no simple personal pronouns in the language. Personal pronoun
functions are expressed via demonstratives.
0.2.6. Demonstratives and personal pronouns
First and second persons can only be expressed on VICS, NICS and emphatic pronouns.
There are no simple or derived pronominal forms for first or second person. Personal
pronouns for third person are derived from demonstratives. The semantic categories
encoded in demonstratives are proximity to speaker vs proximity to hearer vs distal,
singular+gender, and plural (in which no gender is expressed), as well as a small range of
temporal categories as well. These may occur as arguments in NP positions within the
clause and they may be used for noncontrastive emphasis or even in apposition to
emphatic pronouns.
0.2.7. Verbal and nominal inflectional clitics
0.2.7.1. Nominal inflectional clitics (NICS)
NICS follow possessed non-xi' nouns to indicate person, number and (third person)
gender of the possessor, and they may replace VICS in some types of nominalized
clauses. We have analysed them as clitics, rather than suffixes, primarily on phonological
grounds: (i) they never bear primary stress (which otherwise goes on the last syllable of
the noun preceding them); and (ii) they fail to undergo vowel harmony (or trigger it) with
the noun to which they attach.
0.2.7.2. Verbal inflectional clitics (VICS)
VICS always express person, number and gender (for third person) of the subject and
‘primary’ object (according to the semantic role hierarchy in (c) above). They also
express tense when the verb is clause-initial, except when tense is prohibited by a
particular postverbal modifier. The VIC is a (simple) clitic. As with NICS, VICS fail to
undergo vowel harmony with the word immediately preceding them, in this case the verb,
and they never bear primary stress. Unlike NICS, however, they can appear alone in
certain types of question responses and discourse circumstances (which certainly argues
against affixal status for them). We analyse each of the two parts of the VIC (subject and
object agreements) as affixes, at least prosodically:
(e)[VIC subject agreement-object agreement]The two parts of the VIC are stressed as a single word (stress on the last syllable) and
vowel harmony may take the entire VIC in its scope, but is otherwise allowed only within
words, VICS almost always form a single pause or breath group with the verb. By
labelling the VIC as a simple clitic (as per Zwicky 1977; see also Everett 1996), we claimWari'6that the VIC is in fact a grammatical word, but phonologically dependent, in this case
part of the preceding pause or breath group. Although rhythmically it seems to be part of
the preceding verb, intonation always falls sharply immediately before the VIC.
VICS may also manifest tense, but only when the VIC is in second position in its
clause. This is a result of the fact that tense in 'ON must occur in sentence second
position; see below.","[15, 16, 17, 18, 19]"
"1.2.1.2.2. Direct objectWari'118As with a subject, third person direct object may be expressed as an NP (178a),

"Subject and object portions of the verbal inflectional clitic are treated themselves as
affixes, i.e. in relation to Vowel Harmony and stress, the two portions of the VIC behave
as though they form a single root or are two suffixes on a single root. It might be possible
to consider the subject portion of the VIC as the head of the VIC. This is partially
supported by the fact that, in general, subject agreement is obligatory, while object
agreement is optional. Thus object agreement may not usually occur without subject
agreement. However, there are some (rare) cases that have been observed with first
person and third person object, where object agreement may occur without subject
agreement.
(625) a.",[338]
"0.3. DERIVATIONAL MORPHOLOGY
Typologists and theoreticians should find 'ON derivational morphology quite interesting
since sentences and phrases productively serve as input to zero-derivation and
compounding. These processes in fact provide interesting evidence for sentence
constituent structure. Zero-derivation takes a word, phrase or clause as input and returns a
single word as output, with no affixation. When the input is larger than a single
grammatical word it may be distinguished from the output prosodically since the output
will receive a single primary stress on its rightmost syllable. The stresses on the rightmost
syllable of each individual word of the input will surface as secondary stresses in the
output. Vowel harmony does not apply across words, even when they have been
compounded.
There is a simple argument which shows that the output Cc zero-derivation of a verb
from a clause is a single word, viz., tense placement. As we remark later on in this
overview and in the main body of the grammar, tense must be the second constituent in
the clause when it occurs. But a tense VIC may follow an entire ‘verbalized’ clause,
strongly supporting our analysis of these structures as single words, i.e. verbs. Another
argument in favour of verbalization of entire clauses is that if they are not verbs they
would be the only examples of nonCOMP or nonverb-initial clauses in the language. This
result is therefore potentially significant for theories of the lexicon and its interface with
the syntax, as well as general typologies of morphological systems.
Nouns can also be zero-derived from various combinations of morphemes, including
verbs, INFL+verb pieces, verb+VIC, entire clauses and nominalized clauses, providing
additional information on constituent structure.
Compounding is another very interesting and highly productive derivational process in
'ON. In fact, nearly all multimorphemic verbs are derived via compounding (except for
zero-derived phrases), with reduplication accounting for the rest. That is, verbs are not
formed by simple affixation, nor by incorporation. Nouns occur in verbs only by zeroderivation, often followed by compounding. This is interesting since regardless of the
morphemic complexity of 'ON verbs, they never undergo affixation (aside from
reduplication). In this sense, 'ON verbal morphology might be considered almost
exclusively derivational, since reduplication itself appears largely, if not completely,
derivational in its meaning, although this cannot be asserted categorically due to the fact
that the output of reduplication semantically is often aspectual. On the other hand,
aspectual morphology is not easily classifiable in terms of the derivational-inflectional
split. If we consider it inflectional, then it is the only case of inflectional verb
morphology. If we consider aspectual change derivational, then 'ON verbs have no
inflectional morphology at all, except for suppletive plural/aspectual forms. The onlyAn overview of 'oro nao' grammar7clear cases of inflectional morphology throughout 'ON grammar are then -xi' nouns, the
preposition, NICS, and VICS, and possibly the emphatic pronouns (if we consider each
of the different emphatic pronominal forms to be derived via suppletive inflection from a
single base—a questionable tactic).","[19, 20]"
"*Maqui'mawum?come2semph:2s‘Did you come?’First and second person pronominal subjects are often heard in exchanges between
outsiders and the Wari', however we consider this to be merely a form of ‘mission
language’. The use of first and second person pronominal subjects is never observed in
exchanges strictly among the Wari' themselves. Third person subject may, however, be
expressed by a demonstrative pronoun, as well as a VIC, as in (176).
