Many Australian languages are described as having free word order in the sense
that their syntactic functions (e.g., subject and object) are not signalled by word
order as they are in English, and that there is no fixed orders in phrase-like units.
Garrwa is like other Australian languages in this regard. However, as this section264Syntaxshows, there are clear patterns of ordering – some are syntactic based and some
are pragmatically based.
A sentence can minimally include a verb plus a TAM clitic, but only when
there is an established third person subject referent (which (9.39) illustrates) or
in imperative contexts. For all other persons and numbers, a pronoun must also
be used (which (9.40) and (9.41) illustrate). The verb-TAM clitic-pronoun combination thus forms the core of a Garrwa sentence. Nominal groups that represent
the core arguments of predicates (verbs) are not grammatically obligatory and
frequently occur in intonation units following the core (see below). Adjuncts tend
to occur at the periphery of the sentence, usually finally, and often in a separate
intonation unit.
The canonical word order in simple sentences can be represented by the following template:
(conjunction) – (adjunct) – Core {comprising initial and second positions} – (core argument
nominal group) – (adjuncts).","[280, 281, 282]"

‘I’m waiting for lilyroots, granny, lilyroots.’ (9.5.01.1.KS)Therefore, Garrwa verbs occur either clause initially and thus host the secondposition clitic, or they occur initially among the linguistic elements that occur
after the second position. These properties have led to the analysis that Garrwa
has a verb-initial basic word order.¹⁷ The word order properties in Garrwa are thus
less free than how many other Australian languages have been described. Some
ordered structures can be attributed to a highly systematic use of word order to
mark particular pragmatic profiles (see §9.4 for more details), while others (e.g.,
the ordering of nominal arguments and adjuncts when following the second position) appear more grammatically motivated.
In the next section, I summarize the key morphosyntactic properties of
Garrwa word classes.",[55]
"Case frames and argument structure185In order to account for the different patterns of predicates and arguments and
their respective case frames found in the data, I identify four basic constructions
that express these interactions: intransitive, transitive, semi-transitive, and reflexive/reciprocal, into which verbs may fit.⁶¹ The transitive and intransitive constructions are mutually exclusive (verbs are found in one or the other), but there
is scope for these verbs to occur in semi-transitive and reflexive frames if their
semantics is compatible. In the following sections, I describe the four constructions (for more on case marking and roles, see §4.4) and give some examples of
the kinds of verbs that regularly occur in each type of construction.
a) Intransitive constructions comprise an S-argument only in an unmarked case
(nominative or absolutive).⁶² An overt S-argument, especially in third person singular contexts, is not obligatory. Basic motion and stance verbs tend to occur in
intransitive constructions.

for the subject in an intransitive construction, and ‘O’ for the object in a transitive construction.","[202, 203]"

‘Bring her to Robinson River!’ (modal marking only in second
position)The positioning of basic grammatical information in second position, such as
person, number, and grammatical relations of core arguments, as well as tense,
aspect, and modal information, is an areal feature of north-central Australia
that includes Garrwa and some languages to its south and west (Mushin 2005c;
Mushin 2006). For example, similar structures are found in some NgumpinYapa (e.g., Warlpiri and Gurindji), Tangkic (e.g., Ganggaliida), and Mirndi (e.g.,
Wambaya) languages. Waanyi pronouns appear to behave similarly to Garrwa,
but Waanyi does not have tense or aspect marking in this position as Garrwa does.
The Garrwa second-position system differs from others in the region because it a)
lacks an auxiliary or catalyst element (cf. Warlpiri and Gurindji), b) lacks a clear
distinction between free and bound pronoun paradigms (cf. all other Australian
languages with second-position clitics), and c) shows variation in the placement
of pronouns and tense, aspect, and modal markers (cf. Warlpiri and Wambaya
where the order is fixed). Further properties of the Garrwa second-position clitics
are discussed in §5.7 (second person pronouns), §8.1 (tense, aspect, and modal
clitics), and §9.3 (syntax).
As shown in the examples above, the verb is the default word class that occurs
in the initial position that precedes the second-position clitic complex. However,
as discussed in detail in Chapter 9, if there is a motivation for marking a word as
prominent (or focused), then that word is found in immediate initial position and
the verb occurs immediately after the second-position complex. This is illustrated
in (3.7) with a question-and-answer pair from a narrative text. The question word
occurs initially in the question, while the information that answers the question
is also found in initial position.

"9.3.4 Ordering of adjuncts
Core-only sentences are rare in actual discourse. Most sentences contain additional linguistic material in the form of clause combiners (conjunctions), modifiers (adjuncts), and nominal groups that refer to core arguments. Adjuncts can
come before or after the core, although they are usually follow the core and its
associated nominal arguments. Adjuncts tend to follow nominal groups if both
are present.

The above examples all feature simple sentences uttered under a single intonation contour. In actual discourse, where turns of talk are built up in real time,
core argument nominal groups and adjuncts usually follow the core where it is
offset by an intonation break. This results in increments of information that relate
to the event denoted by the verbal or non-verbal predicate. Examples (9.62) to
(9.65) illustrate these incremented sentences. Note that, whether found under the
same intonation contour or separated by an intonation break (signalled with a
comma), core-argument nominal groups and adjuncts are far more commonly
follow the verb+TAM+pronoun core than precede it. Where the increment is coreferential with a core argument pronoun, the structure takes the form of a rightdislocation construction.

There are many contexts where sentences departs from canonical word order –
that is, where verbs are in core-initial position and pronouns are in second position. Non-canonical word orders have been divided into two types: grammatically
determined non-canonical orders, and pragmatically determined non-canonical
orders.","[288, 289, 290]"

‘Tell us how you all were.’ (16.5.00.1.KS)9.3.2 Status of second-position pronouns in the core
I describe second position in the core as one position even though there is some
variation in where some TA clitics attach in this clausal position. Aside from the
past clitic =yi, which Mushin (2008) argues shows signs of becoming a verbal
inflection, the TAM and pronominal elements of the second position cannot be
split by other clausal elements (e.g., nominal groups or parts thereof, adjuncts),
and they are found within the same intonation unit. This is evidence that speakers do treat TAM+pronoun clusters as a syntactic unit whatever their morphological properties.
As noted in §5.7, there are good reasons to analyse Garrwa second-position
pronouns as clitics. Garrwa second-position pronouns have many phonological
properties of clitics: they are unstressed and sometimes reduced. While they can
occur utterance initially under marked pragmatics conditions, such as contrast
or emphasis, these contexts are infrequent in discourse. In clauses with more
than one (non-compounded) pronoun (e.g., representing core and oblique arguments), it is highly unusual for the pronouns to be discontinuous. In most cases,
the order is subject-pronoun and then object or oblique pronoun.
However, unlike the modal clitics, which can never occur outside of second
position, pronouns are written as independent words in this grammar to take
account of their capacity to occur in other positions in the clause according to
their pragmatic and semantic roles.⁸⁸ Other Australian languages that have established clitic pronouns (sometimes in second position and sometimes elsewhere)
tend to have alternate or different forms for their free pronouns. This is not the
case for Garrwa. Whether in second position or elsewhere, the pronouns have the
same forms, and these forms are the basis for regular case marking because other
nominals are case-marked (although there are particular case allomorphs for pronouns – see §5.2). Certainly, speakers do not consider second-position pronouns
to differ from pronouns found elsewhere in the clause.","[284, 285]"
"9.6.1.1 Subject shared between main and dependent clause
In the vast majority of cases, dependent clauses with shared subjects are ordered:
verb + (complement) + (adjunct), which mirrors the verb initial ordering of simple
sentence main clauses. The following examples all have verb-initial dependent
clauses.

In the following examples, the object of the main clause is the understood subject
of the dependent clause. This pivot argument usually occurs just prior to the
dependent clause, which creates a link between the two clauses. Therefore, the
case forms of the pivot are consistent with the analysis that the subject of the
dependent clause is the object of the main clause. When the pivot is a nominal
group, it is found in the absolutive (i.e., unmarked) form, even when it functions
as the subject of a transitive dependent clause, a context that would normally
result in ergative case marking (which (9.145) and (9.16) illustrate). When the pivot
is a pronoun, it is in accusative case, which (9.147) and (9.148) illustrate. In (9.147),
where the dependent clause has a reciprocal argument, the pronoun is repeated
in the dependent clause with the reflexive/reciprocal marker -ngka.","[308, 309]"
"This is the order given in speaker’s utterances in almost all elicitation contexts.
In declarative sentences of positive polarity, where there is no marked pragmatic
constituent (§9.4.2), the verb is the initial element of the core. In many other contexts, other elements may occur as the initial element of the core. In such cases,
the verb occurs in the immediate post-core position. I discuss these contexts
below as non-canonical word orders because they are associated with marked
pragmatic contexts.",[282]
"9.4.1 Grammatically determined non-canonical orders
There are some forms that are obligatory in core-initial position: interrogative
words (§6.3), the negative particle miku (see §9.5.1), and the contrastive particle
ngala (§8.3.3). When these forms are used, they occur in the slot that verbs fill in
canonical word order sentences. TAM clitics and pronouns directly follow these
obligatorily initial elements. In such cases, the verb directly follows the core

"102 There are many aspects of Garrwa discourse that I do not include in this grammar, but
which would ideally be relevant to a chapter on discourse-related phenomena. These include a
detailed analysis of the discourse functions of prosody, and the ways in which Garrwa speakers
organize utterances into larger structures, such as conversational sequences. Some work on
Garrwa conversation has been published elsewhere (e.g., Gardner and Mushin 2007; Mushin
and Gardner 2009, 2011; Gardner 2010).

Like most languages, prominence in Garrwa is perhaps most saliently and iconicallymarked through prosody. Prominent information tends to be more stressed,
louder, and at the boundaries of intonation units, including in its own intonation unit.¹⁰⁴ Prominence is also signalled by word order. The information packaging properties of word order are described in detail in §9.4. To summarize that
section, information that is an answer to an information question and construed
as contrastive or highly emphatic is found in the initial position of the core of
Garrwa clauses, which (10.1) and (10.2) illustrate.

For
example, established information may be variously called “given”, “old” (e.g., Chafe 1976), “accessible” (Ariel 1990), “thematic” (e.g., Firbas 1992), or “topic” (e.g., Lambrecht 1994). Lesspredictable information may be called “new” (e.g., Chafe 1976), “focus” (e.g., Lambrecht 1994;
É Kiss 1998), “pragmatically marked” (Payne 1992), “newsworthy” (Mithun 1992), “prominent”
(Choi 1999), “rheme” (Firbas 1992), and a range of other terms. See Baker and Mushin (2008)
for more on information packaging in Australian languages.
104 A systematic empirical study of Garrwa prosody is yet to be attempted but would be an
important part of the understanding of Garrwa information packaging.","[318, 319]"
"109positional and which may or may not constitute part of an auxiliary constituent.
The status of Garrwa pronouns compared with pronominal types in other Australian languages has been discussed in Mushin (2006) and Simpson and Mushin
(2008), and this section expands on the analysis developed in those papers.
Dixon (2002) analyses Garrwa as a language that lacks bound pronouns, but
which has, perhaps, some incipient signs of developing bound pronouns through
the compound pronoun forms. While the compound pronouns do indeed bind
pronouns to each other, this is not the same as bound pronouns as a category of
pronoun that must itself be attached to another word or constituent.
In a number of Australian languages, bound pronouns are transparently
derived from free forms (e.g., Wambaya (Nordlinger 1998)), which usually
includes a systematic reduction in form. In Garrwa, while there are some clear
contexts in which forms may be reduced, as a class, these reduced forms do not
appear to form a distinct paradigm on distributional grounds. This is evidence
against the analysis of Garrwa pronouns as having a free set and a bound set
(what Mushin and Simpson (2008) call “dual systems”), and I have maintained
the treatment of Garrwa pronouns as a single class. It is for this reason that I
have represented pronouns as independent words in all example sentences, even
when they prosodically and positionally seem to behave more like clitics than
independent words.
Almost all tokens of core argument pronouns in both elicited and text examples occur as the second element in what I call the clause’s core (see §9.3.1).³⁸
Second position is the default or unmarked position for Garrwa pronouns. When
they are in second position, pronouns are always non-stressed and may be analysed as cliticized to the preceding constituent.³⁹ Often, this preceding constituent is a verb (which (5.109) and (5.110) illustrates), but, as examples (5.111) and
(5.112) illustrate, when verbs do not occur in initial position, such as in interrogative and negative contexts, the pronoun remains in second position. This is evidence that the pronoun is attracted to second position rather than to the class of
verb.

"268SyntaxExamples (9.47) to (9.49) illustrate pronouns occurring in positions other than
second position in the core. In each example, an initial and preverbal pronoun
expresses a referent in contrast with other referents. In (9.48), for example, the
speaker (in Borroloola) instructs the addressee (the linguist) to go east (to Robinson River) where Garrwa people will be able to talk to her about the Garrwa language. The speaker then claims to have forgotten much Garrwa in contrast with
the Robinson River people who have not. The utterance consists of three main
clauses: an imperative clause; a future+pronoun-initial clause, and a pronouninitial clause.⁸⁹

The order of core arguments (i.e., nominal forms that express A, S, and O roles)
depends entirely on a) whether the argument is expressed as a noun/nominal
group or as a pronoun, and b) the information status of the arguments in a given
clause. The effects of information status on this order are discussed in general
in §9.4 and §10.1. It is unusual for more than one argument to be expressed as
a noun or nominal group.⁹⁰ Pronominal arguments are almost always found in89 Further work is required to determine whether the initial ja= in sentences such as example
(9.48) should be analysed as core initial alone or together with the pronoun. For now, I analyse
the construction ja= + pronoun as constuting initial position together.
90 This is consistent with DuBois’ (1987) “preferred argument structure”.","[285, 286]"

There are several identifiable contexts in which words other than those canonically found in initial position (i.e., verbs and other words that are grammatically
found in core-initial position) occur in initial position. Nouns are by far the most
frequent type of word in this position, followed by temporal adverbs. Some conjunctions (e.g., baki) may precede them, just as some conjunctions may precede
verbs. In such contexts, the initial word precedes a pronoun, and the verb follows
the pronoun so that the pronoun retains its second-position status. In third
person singular contexts, there is no pronoun and the verb immediately follows
the initial word.
The contexts in which this latter word order occurs include situations where
the word in question is pragmatically prominent. This prominence usually occurs
because the speaker has some motivation for making such a word stand out
from the rest of the words in the utterance. These include contexts that are often
called “focus” (e.g., Lambrecht 1994; Vallduví and Vilkuna 1998; É Kiss 1998) in
the linguistics literature – information that is at variance with assumed hearer
expectations. Such contexts might include where a word answers a question or
fills a knowledge gap (what Lambrecht (1994) calls “narrow focus”). In storytelling, this initial position is used for newly introduced referents who are significant
for the plot (e.g., because they will become ongoing characters in the story, or
because they refer to plot-changing information – see Mushin (2005a) for more on
the narrative functions of initial position). In both of these contexts, the relevant
information may be new to the discourse (and possibly new to the hearer), but
newness alone is not the determining factor. As Mushin (2005a) demonstrates for
narrative, new information that has no plot significance does not occur initially.","[291, 292]"
"Simple sentences265Initial position in the core does not necessarily correspond with initial position in
an utterance. This is represented in the template above, and is illustrated by the
following examples (the core of each case is in boldface). In (9.39), two different
types of particles precede the core: the co-ordinating particle baki ‘and’ (§8.3.1),
and the modifying particle muningka ‘anyway’, which is used to indicate that the
speaker has finished with what was said prior and is ready to move on to the next
thing (which may be a repetition of earlier information) (§8.2.2).

by intonation or by the particle barri.

pronoun, although cores frequently include both. There is some variation of ordering in the second position but not between initial and second position.⁸⁶ Modal
clitics, if they occur, always immediately follow this initial constituent, which
is subsequently followed by a pronoun (nominative, accusative, or compound).
Tense/aspect clitics either immediately follow the initial constituent or follow the
second-position pronoun (see §8.1 for more discussion of the attachment possibilities of the tense/aspect clitics). The core’s second position thus constitutes86 The future marker =ja= may itself be part of the core-initial constituent when it is proclitic
to an initial pronoun, but it is usually part of the second position in the core as proclitic to a
second-position pronoun or as enclitic to a core-initial verb.","[282, 283]"
"298SyntaxIt is also possible in some contexts to chain clauses so that one tense/aspect
marker and often a pronoun has scope over more than one unmarked verb. In
(9.165), for example, which follows directly from the extract in (9.163), two temporally ordered events (shooting people and throwing them into the floodwater) are
expressed, but only the first event occurs in core-initial position and is followed
by the TA-marked pronoun. The second event is marked with a verb in post-core
position, but the arguments of the second verb are understood to be the same
arguments as the initial verb. Example (9.166), which is from the same text, illustrates a similar structure.

‘They would run and climb up a hill.’ (15.5.00.1.DR)A similar structure is found in (9.167), which has three chained verbs. Only daba
‘fight/kill’ occurs in the core. In this example, it is unclear whether the verbs
indicate a sequence of temporally ordered events (e.g., fighting, then cutting in
half, then cracking (heads) open), or whether these are presented as incremental
descriptions of the nature of the violence. Note that in (9.167), but not in (9.165)
and (9.166), the three events are separated by intonation breaks.

with respect to the core-initial verb. In (9.168), the two verbs nyindijba ‘be hidden’
and jungku ‘sit’ occur either side of the second-position pronoun and seem to
describe the scene as one where the children hide by sitting next to a ghost gum
tree. Note that the order of these two verbs is reversed in the repetition, which
supports the interpretation of these events as not temporally ordered.","[315, 316]"

"290SyntaxIn many cases, however, dependent clauses also include complements, mostly
direct and oblique objects, as well as adjuncts. For purposive, subsequential, and
same-subject clauses, the subject of the main and dependent clause is the same
so there is no expressed subject in the dependent clause. For the different subject
and irrealis clauses, the subject of the dependent clause corresponds with the
direct object of the main clause.
As the examples below illustrate, dependent clauses always occur at the right
periphery of the sentence. They may occur following an intonation break (which
(9.135), (9.136), and (9.138) illustrate), although it is far more common to find such
clauses in an intonation unit. Dependent clauses in Garrwa clearly share properties with what have been described as subordinate clauses in other Australian languages (most clearly articulated for Wambaya in Nordlinger (2006)). The
simultaneous-same and different-subject clauses also share features with Hale’s
(1976) description of the “adjoined relative” clause to the extent that they may
be interpreted as NP modifying (relative) or as an adverbial clause. For example,
(9.142) may be translated as ‘I heard my baby who was crying’ or ‘I heard my baby
while it was crying’. The extent to which Garrwa dependent clauses are similar or
different from other Australian languages remains to be seen.","[307, 308]"
"1.3 Linguistic affiliation
Garrwa, along with neighbouring Waanyi, belongs to the Garrwan language
family. Garrwa itself consists of at least two varieties: Heavy Garrwa, sometimes
called Gunindirri/Kunindirri or Eastern Garrwa; and Light Garrwa or Western
Garrwa. Harvey (2009: 195) considers the Garrwan language family to comprise
three distinctive varieties – Garrwa proper, Gunindirri, and Waanyi. All of the
Garrwa speakers surveyed for this study agree that Gunindirri is a variety of
Garrwa and that Waanyi is a different language. Garrwa speakers also recognize
the closer relationship between Garrwa and Waanyi, which are clearly genetically
related, and the other surrounding languages (e.g., Yanyuwa, Wambaya, Gudanji,
Ganggalida), which are not related.
Breen (2003: 430) provides a comparative list of 179 lexical items in both
Eastern and Western Garrwa and Waanyi, and comparisons between Garrwa,
Waanyi, and surrounding languages. His findings are summarized in terms of
cognate percentages in Table 1.
The percentage of cognate vocabulary support speakers’ perceptions that
Eastern (Gunindirri) Garrwa and Western Garrwa are the same language but that
Waanyi is a different, yet related, language. In addition to the relatively high percentage of cognate vocabulary, Garrwa and Waanyi also have similar grammars:
they share most pronouns and word order patterns, case marking, and verb mor-4 Many have told me that many Yanyuwa speakers also know Garrwa and can speak it because
it is an easier language than Yanyuwa. Most of the Garrwa speakers I have worked with agree
with this and few of them know much Yanyuwa despite living in close proximity.",[23]
"7.5.1 -Ji ‘purpose’
Complex clauses marked with –ji ‘purp’ mean ‘do X in order to do Y’. In intransitive clauses, the subject of the subordinate clause must be co-referent with the
subject of the main clause, and is only mentioned in the main clause. In transitive
clauses, the object may also be co-referential.

Like the purposive construction, subordinate clauses marked with -jiwa ‘subsequent’ must share a co-referential subject with the main clause, and they must
denote an event that takes place subsequent to the event in the main clause (‘X
until Y happens’). That is, the event denoted in the subordinate clause marks a
subsequent or concluding action that was brought about by the event denoted in
the main clause. For example, in (7.134), the eating of food is a subsequent action
predicated on the subject first getting up. Similarly, in (7.135), the cooking of the
goanna is framed as the subsequent action which is dependent on the killing
of the goanna in the first instance. In (7.136), the projected recording session is
framed as a subsequent event to the linguist’s return (she was absent at the time
this was uttered).

a purposive reading. As an endpoint, the second event can be read as the intentional consequence of performing the first event (‘do X in order to Y’). This is the
meaning attributed to -jiwa in Furby and Furby (1977). The suffix -jiwa differs from
-ji in that it does not require the agent of the events to have a conscious intention
(‘Y as a consequence of X’, ‘X leading up to Y’). The following examples appear to
incorporate a (weak) purposive meaning, which indicates the close relationship
between -ji and -jiwa.

states, however. It is not clear from my current data whether the –jiwa marked
clause is viewed as a result.
Another difference between the purposive -ji and the subsequent -jiwa is the
ability for subordinate clauses with -jiwa to occur following the co-ordinating
conjunction baki ‘and’ (described in §9.6.1). The use of baki, which is the regular
conjoiner of temporally ordered clauses, raises the possibility that speakers do
not always treat -jiwa clauses as subordinate. It is not possible for clauses marked
with the other verb inflections to occur with conjunctions. -Jiwa may be special
because it has temporal ordering as part of its core meaning, and this is what may
be motivating its co-occurrence with baki.

The subordinate clauses formed with the irrealis suffix -kanyi must have the same
subject as the main clause. It is commonly used to form complements to verbs of
communication and cognition. It is also used in the formation of negative verbs.
When the main verb is a verb of speaking or cognition, the subordinate clause
represents the action being thought or spoken (e.g., ‘I told her to X’, ‘I thought
about X’) rather than the content of speech/thought as in indirect speech representation. The suffix -kanyi is glossed with irrealis because it always occurs in
contexts where the proposition of the subordinate clause is not realised, which is
usually because the proposition in question is a thought, desire, or words of the
subject of the main clause, and not a representation of the actualisation of the
proposition.

-kanyi occurring in contexts where the purposive clause denotes something done
habitually, or when attention is being drawn to the general utility of the object in
the main clause. It does not denote any particular instance of the event in question. In this sense, the subordinate clause appears to function as a modifier of the
object of the main clause. Examples (7.151) to (7.155) come from Furby and Furby
(1977), but I have re-translated the examples to better reflect the use of the irrealis
suffix to signal certain kinds of habitual behaviours.

The contexts in which these morphemes may be used is restricted to simultaneous actions, ones where the activity described in the switch-reference marked
clause must coincide in time with the event / activity in the main clause. Examples (7.156) to (7.159) illustrate this. In this sense, switch-reference marked clauses
are aspectually activities.
The suffix -jina marks co-reference between the subject of the main clause
and the subject of the subordinate clause (i.e., subject control), while -kurri marks
co-reference between the object of the main clause and the subject of the subordinate clause (i.e., object control).

reference coding, there do not seem to be any general valency restrictions with
respect to switch reference marking. These clauses can be transitive or intransitive. Note that the subject of the transitive subordinate clause takes its case
marking from its role in the main clause. That is, it does not have the expected
ergative marking but rather absolutive marking as the object of the main clause.

reported speech contexts. That is, the content of speech does not count as a
simultaneous action. This is interesting because the content of perception does
count as a simultaneous action for the purposes of switch reference marking. One
explanation is that speech representation (whether direct or indirect) involves a
shift in perspective from the framing clause of speech to the content of speech.
Perception sentences do not involve a shift in perspective.
Note also that switch reference is not used when the content of speech
expresses some embedded illocutionary force, such as a command (-kanyi is used
in these contexts).

speech. In (7.166), the irrealis -kanyi is used, while in (7.167), the content of speech
is represented as direct speech with a deictic shift to future tense in the second
clause.

7.6.1 -Wa “still”
This aspect-like morpheme is used to indicate that the action denoted by the
verb is still going or continuing. Because this morpheme seems exclusive to verbs
(there is another homophonous morpheme -wa that attaches to directionals and
demonstratives to reinforce directionality – see §6.1.3.2) and not associated with
a position, I do not analyse this as a tense/aspect clitic. Semantically, it has more
in common with other aspectual clitics.","[209, 210, 211, 212, 213, 214, 215, 216, 217]"
"10.1.2 The ‘prior information’ particle barri
The particle barri, here glossed as ‘pi’ or ‘prior information’, is a discourse-frequent form whose meaning is clearly associated with the organization of discourse rather than the propositional content of utterances.¹⁰⁶ Generally, barri has
scope over the information that precedes it (usually the word that precedes it),
and operates in conjunction with word order and prosody to signal the status
of information being expressed. While the precise pragmatic properties of barri
have yet to be completely solved, its principle function appears to be to link information under its scope with prior information. Such prior information may be
mentioned earlier in the same discourse, or may constitute shared information
with the interlocutor. Barri frequently occurs following the distal demonstrative
nanda, which supports its analysis as a type of anaphoric discourse marker. For106 Barri was originally analysed as a hesitation marker (e.g., like English um) in Furby and
Furby (1977) and Belfrage (1992), perhaps due to its seemingly flexible distribution within
clauses. However, it has no properties of true hesitation markers. Kirton and Charlie (1996)
analyse the similar Yanyuwa particle barra as a focus particle.",[321]
"3.2.4 Particles and clitics
Garrwa particles are identified as forms that do not take any additional suffixes,
inflectional or otherwise. Forms of this type exhibit a range of grammatical functions that includes adverbial-like clausal modification (§8.2), location (§6.2.3),
clause combining (§8.3), negation (§9.5.1), and a range of functions associated
with discourse organization and talk-in-interaction (Chapter 10). Some particles
typically occur utterance initially (e.g., baki ‘and’ (§8.3.1)), some typically utterance finally (e.g., junu ‘perhaps’ (§8.2.5)), while others occur in second position
(e.g., kuna ‘question’ (§8.1.2.5)). Particles that occur in utterance-medial positions are usually weakly cliticized to the preceding word. I consistently represent
particles as independent words in this grammar in the interests of consistency.
Garrwa speakers treat them as independent words.
Garrwa clitics are always prosodically dependent on the preceding word, and
speakers do not typically treat them as independent words. Most clitics occur in
second position as part of the second-position clitic cluster within the core of the
Garrwa clause (§9.3.1). These include: tense and aspect markers (e.g., =yi ‘past’,
=yili ‘habitual’, =ngka ‘present’, and =ja= ‘future’ (§8.1.1)) and modal markers
(e.g., =kiyi ‘imperative (§8.1.2.1) and =wali ‘evidential’ (§8.1.2.4). Examples (3.16)
to (3.21) below illustrate these.

second-position clitic complex. As with particles, I consistently write them as
separate words, although it is clear that pronouns in the second position are
phonetically dependent on the preceding word in discourse. Modal clitics always
directly attach to the word in core-initial position. The examples above have tense
or aspect clitics attached to the second-position pronoun. However, as Mushin
(2008) and §8.1.1 of this book discuss, tense and aspect clitics can also directly
attach to the core-initial word and can precede the pronoun, which (3.22) illustrates with the past tense clitic =yi (=i when attached to pronouns).

Garrwa nouns are formally identified by morphological processes specifically
associated with this word class. Case marking is the most frequent and salient
morphology associated with nouns. Nouns form a large open class with many
subclasses (not all of which are themselves open-class categories). Noun subclasses are identified on the basis of their distribution, meaning, and case allomorphy. In this chapter, I describe the morphological and distributional properties of common and proper nouns, kin terms, and quantifying nouns. I describe
interrogative words, which mostly pattern with nouns, in Chapter 6.
Common nouns cover a large range of semantic types that includes words
referring to people, animate and inanimate natural objects, man-made objects,
and qualities of objects. Unlike many languages in this region, Garrwa has no
grammatical system of noun classification. There is also no verbal agreement or
obligatory pronominal cross-referencing. These are all common morphological
strategies among Australian languages for identifying referents and maintaining reference in discourse. In this context, Garrwa looks morphologically poor,
but Garrwa speakers have various strategies to establish and maintain reference,
such as choosing the referring expression (e.g., noun vs. pronoun vs. zero) and/
or the word order.","[60, 61, 62]"

in nominal groups. Nouns that represent recently mentioned information tend
to occur last in the group. This is consistent with the general ordering principle
to put the most prominent (here the newest) information before less prominent
information in Garrwa. Examples (9.14) and (9.15), which are from the same text,
illustrate this pragmatically based variation with the order of two co-referent
nouns. In the first example, both mundangu ‘long-necked turtle’ and walkurra
‘big one’ are newly mentioned in the discourse. However, in the next example,
mali ‘floodwater’ has been mentioned in the previous utterance. The new information here is provided by walkurra ‘big’, which occurs before mali.

The nominal group is a conversational repair that explicitly changes the humpy’s
owner from the speaker to the father. Wadara occurs last in the second group,
which is consistent with its information status.","[275, 276]"
"Information packaging and the marking of prominence303In (10.4), the speaker constructs a dialogue (a question/answer sequence), followed by the continuation of her exposition. The question asks for the direction
to which the group will travel the next day. As expected, the information that
corresponds to the question’s direct answer is in core-initial position (i.e., kula
‘south’ as an answer to yangka ‘which way’). While kula bears some features of
prosodic prominence (it is relatively high and intense by virtue of being the first
item in the intonation unit), it is the final word nganbi-nyi ‘lilyroot-dat’ that bears
the primary pitch accent for this utterance because it is longer and slightly higher
and louder. While this information was not directly part of the question, it is providing further new information that is of principle concern to the group – the
purpose of the expedition is not just to go south, but also to collect food such as
nganbi. Indeed, nganbi is repeated as the first word in the next utterance after a
gap of over five seconds, and followed by the clausal core. Here, nganbi is also the
most prosodically marked word, and, although it is no longer new information,
it links the return to exposition back to the information in the constructed quote.
This one example is given to illustrate how prosody and word order may work
together to facilitate the flow of information in discourse.","[320, 321]"

‘My boss, (he) grew me up.’ (28.3.00.2.DG)ngan=i
1sgacc=pastIn general, information that is less prominent occurs after the core. The secondposition pronoun and its associated clitics mark a boundary between more or
less prominent information. Second-position forms are never prominent in and
of themselves.
In most cases, the core-initial constituents are also prosodically marked (e.g.,
stressed or in their own intonation unit), and there may be a systematic relationship between the placement of prominent information in an initial slot and its
prosodic marking.
The interaction between prosody and word order for the signalling of information packaging is not simply a matter of stressing an initial-prominent word.
For example, it is not always the case that an initial form is also the most prosodically prominent, and factors such as the regular pattern of repeating intonation
contours in linked utterances will affect the ways that prosody is used to mark
information. This is seen in the following example, which is from an expository
text on bushtucker (Text 1 in Appendix A).

Overall, the co-occurrence of pronouns and co-referential nouns is quite infrequent in discourse. This is largely due to the predominance of first and second
person pronouns, which have no noun equivalents. In third person contexts, nonsingular nominal referents usually co-occur with pronouns, while third person
singular referents rarely have both pronoun and noun in the same clause (reflexive/reciprocal pronouns are an exception). Where it is possible for a pronoun and
co-referential noun to co-occur, only one argument may do so. That is, it is only
possible for either the subject or the object to have such a double reference.
Where subjects are doubly marked, the nominal occurs on the periphery of
the utterance, and sometimes in a different prosodic unit. In the same prosodic
unit, doubly marked objects occur adjacently in the clause’s core (§9.3.1). This
raises questions about the syntactic status of such nominals, especially whether
they or the pronoun has argument status in the clause. Given that pronominal
subjects are far more common than any other kind of referring expression, it
seems likely that it is they, rather than the nominal, that represents the subject
argument of the clause. The argument status of object nouns and pronouns is less
clear when they co-occur. Obliques are clearly represented by either pronouns or
nouns, but not both.","[125, 126]"

The much smaller percentages of shared vocabulary between Garrwa and
other languages of the region are also evidence that Garrwa and Waanyi should
be classified together as one language family separate from neighbouring languages.
In recent years, there has been considerable debate concerning whether the
genetic status the Garrwan language family as a whole is Pama-Nyungan (PN)
or Non-Pama-Nyungan (NPN). This is the main distinction between Australian language families. Of key concern is the mixed-heritage of the free pronoun
system, which appears to have both Pama-Nyungan and Non-Pama-Nyungan
origins (e.g., 3sg nyulu and 3du bula are clearly PN in origin, whereas 2sg ninji
and 2pl narri are not). On this basis, Blake (1990: 61–63) concludes that Garrwan
is Non-Pama-Nyungan. He also cites the lack of cognate case markers with PN
languages as further evidence of this classification. Evans (2005) also classifies
Garrwan as Non-Pama-Nyungan, but, in his branching model, he classifies it as
an immediate sister of PN, with Garrwan the last split before Pama-Nyungan.
Harvey (2009), however, argues that Garrwa is typologically distinct because it
displays many innovations not found in other Australian languages. He argues
that the evidence from pronoun reconstruction and sound changes points to a
genetic relationship with Pama-Nyungan.
Whether PN or NPN, the Garrwan languages are typologically distinctive
among Australian languages. Examples of grammatical features that are distinctive of Garrwan languages (although not necessarily exclusively) include: verbinitial basic word order, a lack of nominal classes or classifiers, compound pronouns (Garrwa only, not Waanyi), tense/aspect positional clitics (Garrwa only,
not Waanyi), and rudimentary phonemic status of retroflexion. Breen (2003),
Mushin (2006), and Harvey (2009) note some shared features with the Yirram
branch of the Mirndi family (especially Wambaya and Gudanji), which includesSocial organization7second-position clitic clusters and elements of verb morphology. However, these
are more likely to be the result of extensive contact rather than shared genetic
heritage.","[23, 24, 25]"

analysis. Under a RRG interpretation of the core (i.e., as a main verb plus its arguments – see Van Valin and LaPolla 1997: 26), this information should be analysed
as part of the core itself. However, as §9.4 and §10.1 illustrate below, there are
various contexts in which such arguments are found elsewhere, which includes
in core-initial position and, depending on their information status, in right and
left dislocations. Furthermore, as §5.6 illustrates, there are many contexts in
which nouns or nominal groups referring to core arguments have co-referential
pronouns in second position. This is particularly the case with non-singular third
person arguments, which (9.55) illustrates.

fulfilling the semantic requirements of verbs, and their formal realisation. Further
analysis of the relationship between prosody and syntactic structure may clarify
the status of arguments directly following the second-position clitic cluster.
The most appropriate analysis may be one that analyses nominals as syntactic
adjuncts that are co-referential with argument positions represented by pronouns
in the second-position clitic cluster (the pronominal argument hypothesis – see,
for example, Jelinek (1984)). However, further analysis of the status of pronouns
in Garrwa grammar is required before such a claim can be definitively made.","[286, 287, 288]"
"Non-canonical word orders275Other common interactive contexts where non-canonical initial elements are
found include when a speaker contrasts with or contradicts something someone
else has said – cases of what I call here managing misalignments. It is also used
for rhetorical emphasis, often with a repetition of the word at the end of the utterance. This of course does not exhaust the possible contexts in which a Garrwa
speaker might use such non-canonical word order. The aim here is to give a sense
of the kinds of contexts where such orders tend to be used.

As noted above, constructions readily translated as English equative sentences
can be formed by collocating nominals, including demonstratives and possessive pronouns. Depending on the context, these constructions may also be interpreted as nominal groups. It is, therefore, unclear whether these can be analysed
as predicative constructions in and of themselves. The following examples from
Ken Hale’s 1962 field notes have a demonstrative–possessive pronoun–nominal
structure, but note the possibilities for rendering them into English.

that the ordering of words in such constructions does not always clearly match
the translated English equative construction.⁸⁵ In example (9.31), which has a
demonstrative–possessive pronoun–noun order, the Garrwa does match the
English, but, in example (9.32) the possessive pronoun nganyi occurs first and is
followed by a demonstrative and a noun.

a) Temporal contexts
Ngala can indicate that one event involving one set of participants occurs at the
same time as another event involving a different set of participants. In these contexts it is usually translated as ‘while’. It is often used in narratives to contrast
what two different (sets of) characters are doing at the same narrative time. In
such clauses there is never any tense marking in the ngala-marked clause as it
inherits its temporal reading from the previous clause. Pronouns always occur
directly following ngala in these contexts.

(9.10.03.1.TD)Ngala can also establish the time that an event or situation occurred relative to
another situation while maintaining the same participant. It is often translated as
‘when’ in these circumstances, although ‘while’ may also be appropriate.

‘He saw them while he was working for the white man.’ (3.0.03.3.KS)b) Contrastive contexts
Ngala can also indicate that the event in question is in contrast with what has
already been said with no implications of relative temporal organisation. In such
cases, ngala is usually translated as ‘but’. In these cases, it is common for the
ngala-marked clause to maintain the word order of an independent clause. This
is the main formal difference between ngala clauses with a temporal implication
and ngala clauses without a temporal implication. It is perhaps iconic of the independence of the connected clauses.
In (8.192), which is from a narrative, the contrasted clause has verb+pronoun
order. In this example, there is a clear contrast between what the people in the
story did not do with a character’s corpse (i.e., bury it in the ground) and what
they did do with it (i.e., they hung it up in a tree).","[263, 264, 265]"
"9.1.1 Case marking in nominal groups
In some Australian languages, all members of the group must be case-marked;
in other Australian languages, only one element needs to be case-marked if the
elements are contiguous. In Garrwa, most of the time all members of a nominal
group are case-marked whether contiguous or discontinuous.⁸²81 The description presented here is mostly based on patterns of ordering observed in actual
usage in the Garrwa corpus, rather than on a detailed analysis of elicited data. More detailed
elicitation would undoubtably enhance the analysis of some of the structures by establishing
boundaries of grammaticality, but structures at the boundaries may be rare in usage.
82 There are a few examples in the corpus where not all members of a nominal group appear
with case marking, but it is clear from elicitation that speakers greatly prefer (and will edit texts
to ensure) all members of a nominal group to have their own case marking. In most cases, I use
unedited text data as examples in this work.",[273]
"5.3.2 Reduction of first person singular pronouns
The first person singular nominative ngayu is frequently reduced to nga when
it follows the future marker ja (e.g., ja=ngayu ~ ja=nga). The reduced form also
occurs in pronominal compounds (§5.4). Other reductions are less systematic,
although they do occur in connected speech (e.g., 2sgnom ninji ~ ninj).

ja=nga
nani
larrbalarrba
smoke
fut=1sgnom like.that
pipe
‘I’m going to smoke that pipe.’ (8.5.01.1.KS)5.4 Compound pronouns
Garrwa compound pronouns combine accusative + nominative pronouns into a
single-word form that represents the human subject and object of a transitive
construction. They only occur when both the subject and the object in the transitive construction are human referents. The accusative form of the pronoun occurs
first in this combination, and this inverts the canonical ordering of free pronominal arguments in which nominative pronouns normally precede accusative pronouns. Compound pronouns have the same distributional properties as single
free pronouns in clauses, which mostly occur in second position but are also able
to occur initially under certain pragmatic contexts.
The compounded forms are quite restricted in the possible person and number
categories that may combine in this structure. Consistent with the limited use of
nyulu’s third person singular nominative form and the absence of a third person
singular accusative form of the word, third person singular forms are not repre-94Pronounssented at all. First person nominative forms are never compounded, and second
person nominative forms are only compounded in combination with first person
singular accusative forms. Accusative non-singular pronouns for all persons are
represented in compounds, but there are clear restrictions on singular forms
(especially for first and second person). First person singular accusative forms
only combine with second person forms (all number categories). Second person
singular accusative forms only combine with first person singular nominative
forms, as well as with third person non-singular forms. Table 12 represents the
possible combinations. Logically impossible combinations (i.e., ones that would
result in reflexive readings) are shaded. Combinations of third person non-singular forms acting on third person non-singular forms can only have non-reciprocal
meanings. There are no attested compounds representing second person forms
acting on second person forms.","[111, 112]"
"8.3.1 Baki ‘and’
This form has a similar distribution to English and as a coordinator, so ‘and’ is its
gloss. It can conjoin noun phrases and clauses as well as larger discourse units.
It is a coordinator because it connects two independent clauses that can have TA
marking. Baki, when it occurs, often occurs initially after an intonation break
and attracts the TA marker =yili (which results in the form bakili). In narratives,
baki is usually used to connect temporally ordered clauses (‘X happened and then
Y happened’), but it can also connect two clauses that describe simultaneous
activities (‘X is happening and Y is happening’).",[257]

This particle/clitic is used in a range of ways, all of which indicate an intensification of that which is under its scope. Speakers frequently translate it as ‘more’,

“more”. For events, it can mean that the event is done repeatedly. Mili is mostly
found in second position and so may be loosely cliticized to the preceding word
as other second-position phenomena are. In the second position, mili appears to
occur after all other possible clitics (TA and pronouns). In (10.30), it occurs after
the TAM clitic =(y)ili; in (10.31), it occurs after both the TA clitic and the following
accusative pronoun; in (10.32) and (10.33), it directly follows the pronoun.

This chapter focuses on word order, particles and their contribution to discourse
organization in Garrwa. Some features of turn management in conversation,
such as overlapping talk and the use of silence, are examined in other work (e.g.,
Gardner and Mushin 2007; Mushin and Gardner 2009; Mushin and Gardner 2010).
The range of particles examined here show much that is common across Australian languages and languages in general, but also much that may be unique to
Garrwa. For example, while the prior information particle barri shares features
with a related particle in Yanyuwa, they are clearly not synonymous. As noted in
the introduction to this chapter, any analysis of discourse phenomena is incomplete without a proper understanding of the use of prosody. Such as study must
be left for future work, however.","[336, 337, 338, 339, 340]"

down7.5 Verb inflectional morphology
Garrwa verbs have little inflectional morphology because many meanings associated with verb inflectional categories (e.g., tense, aspect, mood, agreement)
are either positional enclitics (which may or may not be attached to verbs) or
not signalled at all (e.g., gender, person, number agreement). The only morphology exclusively associated with verbs functions to turn the verb (and its complements) into a complement of another clause. These are analysed as dependent
because they cannot occur as independent clauses, nor can they attract tense/
aspect clitics (see §9.6.1 for a description of the syntax of dependent clauses).
These are five such morphemes, each indicating a different relationship
between the main and subordinate clauses: -ji ‘purposive’, -jiwa ‘subsequence’,
-jina ‘same subject simultaneous’, -kurri ‘different subject simultaneous’, and
-kanyi ‘irrealis’.⁶⁴
These suffixes are built from two initial elements, -ji or -kV-, and a case suffix
as follows:
(7.128)-wa ‘directional’⁶⁵
-(i)na ‘locative’
-(yu)rri ‘allative’
-(a)nyi ‘dative’-jiwa ‘subsequent’
-jina ‘same subject’
-kurri ‘different subject’⁶⁶
-kanyi ‘irrealis’64 Furby and Furby (1977) analyse all of these suffixes as allomorphs (realisations) of a purpose morpheme (tagmeme). It is clear, however, that they have quite different meanings.
65 This suffix attaches to directional and locative words only.
66 The allomorphs of allative and dative case markers for demonstratives are also -kurri and
-kanyi respectively. It may be that these are the earlier forms for the case suffixes, with processes of lenition and reduction leading to the allomorphs used for most nouns.","[206, 207, 208]"

(3.9.03.3.KS)4.4 Nominal case-marking
Case marking morphology largely functions to mark the role a nominal or group
of nouns plays in a clause. Furby and Furby (1977) identify seven cases: “ergative”, “accusative”, “referent” (= “dative”), “locative”, “allative”, “ablative”, and
“translocative”. The morphological and semantic properties of these cases are
discussed in §4.4.1 to §4.4.6. There are some grounds for treating the associative
or having suffix -yudi (§4.5.1) as a case marker because it also indicates the role a
nominal plays in its clause. However, it is classified here among “other nominal
morphology” (§4.5) for reasons discussed below.
In terms of the system of core case-marking, Garrwa has a split ergative
system. All nominal types except pronouns (i.e., demonstratives, interrogatives,Nominal case-marking57kin terms, quantifier nominals, and common nouns) mark transitive subjects (A)
with an ergative suffix, while intransitive subjects (S) and transitive objects (O)
are not marked (absolutive). All pronouns mark transitive objects with an accusative suffix, but leave transitive and intransitive subjects unmarked (nominative),
which Table 7 illustrates.","[72, 73, 74, 75]"
"Morphosyntactic typology35Other relations are signalled by non-core case-marking with dative, locative, and
directional suffixes.

camp-allGarrwa syntax is built around a second-position clitic complex that minimally
includes a pronoun or a tense, aspect, or modal marker, although it mostly
includes both. The second-position pronoun can only mark the subject (nominative pronoun), the object (accusative pronoun), or both the subject and the object
(human referents only). This is illustrated in (3.6). Oblique pronominal arguments
never occur in second position.¹⁶

This convention has arisen in part because of speakers’ treatment of pronouns as independent words, and in part because these pronouns can occur elsewhere in clauses and in contexts
where they are clearly not cliticized (e.g., in utterance-initial position).","[52, 53]"

‘(away) from you’Like most suffixing languages in Australia, Garrwa is largely dependent marking:
regular case-marking is required on nominals, including pronouns and demonstratives, to indicate grammatical function. Verbal inflectional morphology is
limited to a set of participial suffixes: there is no verb agreement and no verbspecific tense/aspect/mood morphology (see §3.3 below).
Also, like many Australian languages, core grammatical relations (subject and
object) follow a “split ergative” pattern (Dixon 1994), where all nouns (including
proper nouns) and demonstratives follow an ergative/absolutive pattern and all
pronouns follow a nominative/accusative pattern,¹⁵ which (3.4) illustrates.

‘Two great dancers, my two grandfathers (were).’ (28.8.03.1.ER)The word for ‘child’ is bayayawa. In dual and plural forms, baya functions as

words. Note that, in (4.154), dual marking occurs in the presence of the 3dunom

the dual suffix in the presence of the numeral kujarra ‘two’, but, in (4.156), -wuya

In (4.157), both the demonstrative and the qualifier nominal minkin ‘skilful’
are marked with the plural morpheme; however, the plurality of badibadi ‘old
woman’ is signalled by partial reduplication. In (4.158), however, the plurality of
badibadi is signalled with -muku (here, there are no other coreferential nominals80Nounsin the noun group). In this example, madamada ‘possum hair skirt’ is not overtly
marked as plural even though the plurality of ‘old women’ implies the plurality
of possum hair skirts. This reinforces the analysis that -muku only marks human
nominals.

(21.3.00.1.DmcD)When -muku attaches to a possessive pronoun, the meaning is ‘X’s mob’ (i.e., all
the people associated/related to X). Again, this reinforces the analysis of -muku
as a marker of numbers of humans only. Note again that, in (4.161), julaki ‘bird’ is

This section summarizes the ways in which both alienable and inalienable possession is marked in Garrwa.
a) Possessors in alienable possessive constructions usually take dative case
marking. This is particularly the case when the possessed is a (more) permanent
fixture, such as one’s own stories, which (4.163) illustrates, or a house, which
(4.164) illustrates. As discussed in §4.2.3, kin relationships are also marked with
dative case.

‘I’m going to hang up my dress.’ (Mushin 2003 field notes)b) A temporarily possessed item (e.g., money) is marked two ways: with the associative -yudi ‘with’, or with the possessor taking locative rather than dative case.
When -yudi is used, the possessor is subject and the possessed is predicate, which
(4.167) and (4.168) illustrate. However, when the locative -na is used, the possessed is subject while the possessor is predicate, which (4.169) illustrates. It is
not clear what motivates the choice between these two constructions in discourse.

part shares the same case marking as the possessor. In (4.170), the possessor is
a nominative pronoun (intransitive subject of the sentence); in (4.171), the possessor is marked as an ergative nominal as the transitive subject of the sentence.
Self-propelled movement of a body part requires a reflexive subject, which (4.172)
and (4.173) illustrate.

Garrwa pronouns fall somewhere between the category of independent words
and bound clitics. There is one set of pronouns, represented in Table 9 below,
with reflexive and reciprocal pronouns derived from this set (§5.5). A subset of
pronouns are able to combine to form compound pronouns (§5.4). Pronouns
share many properties with nouns, which includes grammatical functions such
as core and oblique arguments, the capacity to refer, and anaphoric functions.
Like nouns, pronouns inflect for case to signal the role they play in clauses. Pronouns, however, have distinct case allomorphs from nouns (§5.2) and distinctive
syntactic properties (§5.6 and §5.7).
In isolation, these forms are phonological words and can occur independently (e.g., as one-word answers to questions). However, they are more often
found cliticized to a preceding word (i.e., prosodically dependent). The host
of the pronominal clitic is almost always the initial constituent in the clause.
These restrictions on pronoun placement, together with their loose phonological dependency, make Garrwa pronouns resemble both free pronouns and bound
pronouns. Pronoun placement is described in more detail in §5.7. Bound pronouns, in contrast with free pronouns, lack a distinctive paradigm, which makes
Garrwa typologically unusual among Australian languages.","[96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102]"

‘They saw those two fishing.’ (Belfrage 1991field notes)The restriction on human referents for compound pronouns is most clearly seen
in third person non-singular contexts. In (5.58), there is no accusative pronoun
at all despite the transitive frame (see §5.5 for more on the co-occurrence of pronouns and nouns).

clothes
‘They’re going to take them out, the clothes.’ (20.6.08.KS)These compound forms occur obligatorily whenever the relevant transitive frame
has pronominal subjects and objects that have possible compound forms. For
combinations that are not compounds, it is far more common for the subject
pronoun (nominative) to directly precede the object pronoun (accusative). This
is the opposite sequence to compound forms. Tense and aspect markers, when
they occur attached to pronouns, attach to the first pronoun in the sequence.
The differences in the ordering and the attachment of clitics to the first pronoun
demonstrate a clear distinction between compounded pronouns and sequences
of two pronouns.

form. Here, they seem to prefer the accusative pronoun before the nominative
pronoun, which possibly indicates an overall priority for first person singular
pronouns to occur first. Example (5.63) illustrates the variation in the use of compound pronouns compared with sequences of free pronouns. KS’s first assertion
uses a compound pronoun, but her second (repaired) assertion uses a sequence
of free pronouns.³⁴

Reflexive/reciprocal pronouns are formed by attaching the suffix -ngka to the
oblique pronominal stem.³⁵ The first person reflexive form is the suppletive
ngaka. The third person singular reflexive/reciprocal form is na-ngka rather than
the predicted *nanga-ngka. This reduction of the oblique stem from nanga- to nais most likely to avoid juxtaposing two syllables that start with /ng/. The resulting
meaning of reflexive/reciprocal forms is either ‘self’ or ‘each other’. The inter-34 Furby (1972: 4) lists 1sgACC/3plNOM as the possible compound nganyjalu, but no
examples are given in this paper or in other published (and unpublished) work. No form for
1sgACC/3duNOM is attested (such a form might be predicted to be nganbula). My own corpus
has numerous examples of clauses with this combination of a third person plural subject acting
on a first person singular object, but all are collocations of the two full and free pronouns.
35 See Laughren (2002a) for an analysis of the almost identical Waanyi reflexive/reciprocal
system.","[115, 116, 117]"

retained in the negative reading because the meaning relates to social obligations. For example, in (9.110) below, the speaker claims that the protagonists were
not obliged to bury the dead person (because of social convention). Instead, they
hung him up in a tree.

A negative existential predicate construction is formed using miku plus the
clitic =yaji as a nominal predicate. Speakers translate miku=yaji as ‘nothing’. Its
complement is a dative marked nominal or pronoun in such constructions. The
subject is typically unexpressed and interpreted as impersonal, which (9.114) and
(9.115) illustrate. Dative pronouns may indicate the person/number category of
the referent affected by the absence. This is illustrated in (9.115) and (9.116), where284Syntaxa negative possession interpretation is also possible. Most examples in the corpus
have a past time interpretation because they tend to occur in reminiscences of the
past. There is no overt tense marking in these examples.

‘There was no meat for us two down at the camp / We two had no meat

Yaji can also refer to general ‘things’ and places, which (9.119) and (9.120) illustrate. It seems plausible that the negation of such a general concept as a place/
thing could grammaticalize into a negative existential term as it appears to have
done here (i.e., no place = does not exist in space).

‘And you all keep watching my things.’ (3.9.04.4.DG)In some emphatic contexts, miku=yaji may occur with a the third person singular
nominal nyulu. This is common in clauses that start with the contrastive particle
ngala, which (9.121) illustrates. In these examples, miku=yaji is not in initial position because the sentence begins with the contrastive conjunction ngala, which
attracts a second-position pronoun. This ordering pattern relegates miku=yaji to
post-pronominal (post-core) position, which is the usual place for verbal predicates when they are not in canonical-initial position.
Note that the construction retains an impersonal reading even when there
is a third person singular pronoun, which examples (9.121) and (9.122) illustrate.

Almost all questions in the corpus are information questions. As noted above,
these kinds of utterances must begin with either wanya ‘what/who’, wanjawa
‘where’, or yangka ‘which way’, which are followed by second-position pronouns,
other clitics, and the verb in that order.

By far the most common use of question words in Garrwa is to ask questions.
It is common among Australian languages for interrogative forms to also have
indefinite, non-question related meanings (e.g., a form meaning who that can
also mean someone, I don’t know who) (Mushin 1995). It seems that, for Garrwa,
this indefinite reading is rare, certainly in main clauses. There are, however, some
examples from the corpus in which a question word appears embedded. It is
unclear whether the so-called embedded use of question words is associated with
an indefinite reading, or whether these are directly represented embedded questions and the question is simply shifted to the relative time of the main clause.⁹⁵
Example (9.128) illustrates this because the question follows a matrix clause of
direct speech (yanyba ngaki ‘she said to me’), and the deixis in the embedded
clause clearly shifts to the reported speaker (wanjawa nganyi mani ‘where is your
hand?’ rather than ‘where is my hand?’).","[298, 299, 300, 301, 302, 303, 304]"

marked) pronouns with the kin term (with or without -nganja) to indicate the possessor, or a derived verb form of the kin term (using class 1 verb morphology – see
§7.1.1), with a pronominal possessor in nominative case. This construction has
the semblance of a predicate+subject structure, although it is clearly used in discourse exclusively to attribute a kin term to its possessor. This is clearly shown in
(4.15) where the nominal referent “Lobby” is ergatively marked (as the transitive
subject of the clause), but there is no equivalent or comparable inflection in the
kinship ascription.
