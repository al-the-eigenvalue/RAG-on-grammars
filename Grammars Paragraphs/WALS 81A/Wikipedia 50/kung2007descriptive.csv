Table 33 shows the percentages of transitive clauses with one overt
constituent in addition to the verb. The possible word order combinations are
shown in the first column: VO, OV, VS, SV. The numbers in the second column
are the same as the ones in Table 32 for these word orders; these percentages
show the statistical frequency of these transitive clause types compared to all
other transitive clause types. The third column shows the statistical frequency of
transitive clauses with just two constituents compared to other two-constituent
transitive clauses, of which there are 271. These numbers show that when just one
argument co-occurs with the verb, it is usually the object, not the subject. As for
the word order in these single-argument transitive clauses, there is a strong
tendency towards the VO order, which occurs in 65.3% of the clauses. The other
orders occur much less frequently: the OV order occurs in only 18.1% of the
clauses, the VS order occurs in only 10.3%, and the SV order occurs in only 6.3%
of the clauses. The fact that there are many more two-constituent clauses541containing an object than there are clauses containing a subject is not surprising
since, cross-linguistically, it is typically the case that a nominal representing new
information is introduced into the discourse as an object.

Table 34 shows the percentages of transitive clauses with two overt

The possible word order combinations are shown in the first column: SVO, VSO,
OVS, VOS, OSV, and SOV. The numbers in the second column are the same as
the ones in Table 32 for these word orders; these percentages show the statistical
frequencies of these transitive clause types compared to all other transitive clause
types. The third column shows the statistical frequencies of only transitive clauses
with two additional arguments. Again there is a strong tendency for the object to
follow the verb, as seen in the SVO (39.5%), VSO (34.2%), and VOS (10.5%)
orders; the object precedes the verb in the OVS order in 13.2% of the clauses.
Note that of the two possible verb-final word orders, OSV occurs only once and
SOV does not occur at all.","[565, 566, 567]"

After considering the statistics shown above in Tables 31 through 34, it is
clear that, (i) given the high percentage of clauses in which the only major
constituent is a verb, the other constituents (i.e., the subject and object) are not
obligatory in HT; (ii) when there is only one nominal constituent (be it subject or
object) there is a strong tendency for it to follow the verb, (i.e., there is a strong
tendency for the verb to occur in a non-final position in the clause with an overt
nominal); (iii) there is also a strong tendency for the object to follow the verb; and
(iv) when there are two nominal constituents in addition to the verb, there is a
strong tendency for the object to occur in clause-final position.
Pragmatically neutral clauses collected during elicitation follow the VSO
word order; word order tests indicate that both VSO and SVO are dominant
orders; and statistical analysis indicates a slight preference for the SVO word
order, followed closely by the VSO order. Thus, HT has VX word order, where X
may be a subject or an object. Furthermore, it is clear that HT is strongly
influenced by pragmatics, including focus, which is the topic of the following
section (8.2). In the rest of this section, I first discuss examples of the five three543constituent word orders found in HT natural discourse, then I examine the order
of pronouns in HT discourse.
The example in (736) shows the most statistically frequent narrative word
order: SVO. This story is about a poor man who tries to sell pig excrement in a
neighboring town. This is the first reference in the text to the townspeople juu
lapanak. Pragmatically, word order is not necessary to disambiguate the
grammatical roles.

The example in (737) shows the second most frequent narrative word
order: VSO. This narrative is about a flood that occurred in the village the year
before the time of telling. Once again the pragmatics of the clause influence the
determination of the syntactic roles of the constituents.

[T0018: 006]The clause in example (738) shows the third most frequent word order:
OVS. Again, there is only one possible interpretation of the grammatical roles;
while a donkey can take two sacks, the reverse is not possible. Furthermore, the
544sacks are more important to the context than the donkey because they illustrate
the quantity of pig excrement that the poor man took to sell.

word order is not necessary to determine the grammatical roles of the constituents
because people can wash clothes, but clothes cannot wash people.

the pragmatics of the constituents once again influence the determination of their
syntactic roles.","[567, 568, 569, 570]"

Table 32 shows the various possible word orders in a transitive clause,
including verb-only clauses, clauses with just one other constituent (either the
subject or the object), and clauses with two constituents (both the subject and the
object). The first column shows all of the possible word order combinations in a
transitive clause: V-only, VO, OV, VS, SV, SVO, VSO, OVS, VOS, OSV, and
SOV. The second column shows the statistical frequency of all 11 types of
transitive clause. Out of 569 transitive clauses of naturally occurring speech,
45.7% consisted of a verb only. The next most frequently occurring transitive
clause type consisted of a verb followed by an object; this word order occurred in
31.1% of the sample. In comparison, none of the other word orders represented in
Table 32 is statistically significant, and the frequencies of clauses with two overt
arguments are extremely low. The contents of this table are broken down further
in Tables 33 and 34 below.","[564, 565]"

[NVP99/MNB7: 469]The fact that all of the word orders shown in (733) are acceptable is
problematic given that case is not marked on nouns in HT. However, given the
pragmatics of the clausal constituents, it is not difficult to determine that juu
7anu7 lapanak ‘that person’ must be the subject and juu qajin ‘the turtle’ must be
the object since it highly improbable that a turtle would eat a person. Word order
is not needed to determine the syntactic roles in this example.
However, the pragmatics of clausal constituents are not always so
enlightening, and it is easy to find a clause in which the meaning of the
constituents does not pragmatically or culturally influence the assignment of
syntactic roles. Two such clauses are shown below in (734). I want to point out
that the clauses in (734) were volunteered by a speaker with whom I did not
536perform word order tests; I elicited the verb and requested that he give me an
example clause using the verb. In each of these examples, the verb saa ‘hit’ cooccurs with two nominals that are culturally equal.204 It is neither more nor less
likely that John would hit a man than it is that a man would hit John. The clausal
pragmatics do not help to determine the syntactic roles of subject and object;
therefore a fixed word order is needed, and this word order is VSO.

[NVP05]To further check the word order, I took the clause in (734a), and I
rearranged its constituents to create six different clauses; I read all six HT clauses
to a native speaker and asked him to translate them into Spanish. The results are
shown in (735). When the verb was clause-initial, the clause-final nominal was
interpreted to be the object, as seen in (735) a) and (735b). When the verb was in
204 By culturally equal, I mean that one nominal is not expected to hit the other, unlike theexamples shown here in (i) and (ii) in which it is culturally expected that an adult would hit a
child, but not that a child would hit an adult. Note that the word order is VSO in (i), but VOS in
(ii).

[WOQ]In analyzing the statistical frequency of various word order possibilities in
Huehuetla Tepehua, I looked only at clauses from natural discourse (i.e., clauses
from the text database), and I did not include any of the examples that came from
elicitation sessions. Of the 1393 entries in the text database, only 940 predications
538were used to determine basic word order. The remaining entries were not used
because they were clausal fragments, one-word questions or answers, nonverbal
predicates (i.e., present tense predicate nominal or adjectival constructions that do
not require a copula), incomprehensible utterances, or solitary discourse markers,
or they were uttered entirely in Spanish.
Of the 940 usable clauses, 371 were intransitive and 569 were transitive.
Since there were so few samples with which to work, I looked at word order in
both transitive and intransitive clauses. Tables 31 through 34 describe the
statistical frequency of the word orders that I found.
Table 31 shows the various possible word orders in an intransitive clause.
The first column shows the possible word order combinations in an intransitive
clause: V-only, VS, and SV. The second column shows the statistical frequency
of all three types of intransitive clause. Of the 371 intransitive clauses 61.7%
consisted of a verb only. The subject followed the verb in 30.5% of the clauses,
and it preceded the verb in only 7.8% of the clauses. The third column subtracts
the V-only examples, and shows the frequency of the VS and SV examples. Of
the 142 intransitive clauses that contain an overt subject, 79.6% show the VS
word order, while only 20.4% show the SV word order. Thus, there is a strong
tendency for a subject nominal to follow an intransitive verb.","[560, 561, 562, 563, 564]"

WOTotal Clauses = 16Prn V7/16 = 43.7%V Prn9/16 = 56.3%Finally, the statistical word order frequencies of pronominal predications
are shown in Table 38. In these clauses, the pronoun precedes the other clausal
element (which may be a noun, adjective, adverb, relative clause, or copula) in
83% of the examples, while it follows the other element in only 17%. Thus, there
is a strong tendency for the pronoun to precede its predication when the
predication is nonverbal.

X = noun, adjective, adverb, relative clause, copula
WOTotal Clauses = 53Prn X44/53 = 83%X Prn9/53 = 17%The word order of the major constituents in a matrix clause is summarized
as follows: when there is neither context nor pragmatic cues (e.g., elicited data),
the volunteered word order is VSO, and the order SVO is readily accepted by
speakers. All other orders are problematic in such situations. However, in texts
that have ample context and pragmatic cues, the order SVO is somewhat more548frequent than the order VSO, and all other word orders (except SOV) are possible,
though considerably less frequent than SVO or VSO.
8.2 FOCUS
Huehuetla Tepehua has two strategies by which a clausal element may be
focused. I use the term ‘focus’ here to mean prominence rather than contrastive
emphasis. The first strategy involves syntactic focus constructions, specifically
left-dislocationandclefting(section8.2.1).","[572, 573, 574]"

of subject of a verb (but not a copula). When acting as the subject, the pronoun
precedes the verb in 55.6% of the clauses, and it follows the verb in 44.4% of the
clauses. Here, the difference in statistical frequencies is not as dramatic as that
found in Table 35, though there is a slight tendency for the pronoun to occur preverbally.
Table 36: Pronominal Order when Pronoun is Subject

object of the clause. Table 37 below shows the word order frequencies when the
pronoun is the object of a transitive verb. It precedes the verb in only 43.7% of the
clauses, and it follows the verb in 56.3% of them. Thus, when the pronoun is an
object, there is a slight tendency for it to follow the verb.","[571, 572]"

This chapter discusses the syntax of Huehuetla Tepehua, including the
following topics: the word order of the major clausal constituents (section 8.1),
focus (section 8.2), interrogation or question formation (section 8.3), negation
(section 8.4), comparative and superlative constructions (section 8.5), and
complex clauses (section 8.6).
8.1 WORD ORDER OF MAJOR CLAUSAL CONSTITUENTS
In this section, I examine the word order of the major clausal
constituents—subject, object, and verb—in HT. The order of the words in specific
types of phrase are discussed in the relevant chapters on verbs, nouns, modifiers,
adverbs, and numbers—chapters 3 through 7, respectively (e.g., the word order
within a noun phrase is discussed in Chapter 4: Nouns and Nominal Morphology).
While in the field, I found that during elicitation, the word order of my
probe clause—be it in Spanish or Tepehua—would influence the word order of
the HT clause of my consultant’s response. Thus, when I elicited the example
shown in (733a) with SVO word order, my consultant gave me an HT clause with
SVO word order. When I then tested all six possible word orders, my consultant
accepted all of them and claimed there was no difference in meaning. The
example is shown in its entirety below in (733).","[557, 558, 559, 560]"
"591clauses, those that are relativized on subjects of the subordinate verb occur far
more frequently than those that are relativized on direct objects of the subordinate
verb, which in turn occur more frequently than those that are relativized on
indirect or oblique objects within the relative clause. I have found no instances of
a possessor being relativized in HT. With respect to the headless type of relative
clause, these may be relativized only on subjects of the subordinate verb in HT.
I am not aware of any type of hierarchy that ranks the grammatical roles of
the head of the relative clause (i.e., the argument in the matrix clause that is coindexical with the relativized argument in the subordinate clause). The
determination of such a hierarchy would require cross-linguistic comparison of
many different languages from diverse language families and, thus, is outside the
scope of this analysis of the HT relative clause. Suffice to say that in HT, only the
subject or the object of the matrix clause may be the head of a relative clause.
Examples of different types of post-nominal relative clause appear in the
following examples. These examples are ordered with respect to the grammatical
role of the relativized element (i.e., the grammatical role of the “relativized” zero
element in the matrix clause). Relativized subjects of subordinate verbs are shown
in the examples in (811), relativized objects in (812), relativized indirect objects
in (813), and relativized oblique objects in (814). Further examples of headless
relativized subjects are shown below in (815).
In each of the examples in (811), the non-overt relativized element is the
subject of its relative clause. In the examples in (811a) and (811b), the heads of
the relative clauses, maqtili7 and yuuch, respectively, are the subjects of their592respective matrix clauses, as well as the subject of their relative clauses. In (811c),
the head of the relative clause lapanak ‘person’ is the object of the matrix clause
and the subject of the relative clause. The matrix clause in (811d) is a fragment in
which the speaker cut himself off after the relative clause and began a new clause
with the discourse marker entonces ‘then’; however, since the head of the relative
clause, juu pumatam lapanak ‘one person’, occurs in clause-initial position, it
would most likely have been the grammatical subject of the clause, given the
VSO and SVO word order tendencies in this language.

U.S., but I also have a home in Huehuetla with them. There was also the extended
family, who lived in the same courtyard area and who also took me in and gave
me free access to their homes and their lives: don Nicolás’ mother doña Angela,
his two brothers don Laurencio and don Miguel, their wives doña Fidela and doña
Juana, and all of their children.
My deepest and most heart-felt thanks are for my husband, Jon, and our
son, Shaun. Without their love, support, patience, and endless sacrifices, I never
would have been able to finish this grammar. I also want to thank my mom and
dad, who never failed to express their pride, and my father-in-law, a Ph.D.
himself, who continually encouraged my progress.vI have so many additional people to thank that I’m going to thank them in
chronological order, from the start of my graduate career. My fellow cohort
members: Carrie Clarady, Lynda Olman Walsh, David Quinto-Pozos, and Kim
Mellon Kight, for sharing both the good and the bad during the early years; I
wouldn’t have made it to candidacy without their friendship. Heidi Johnson, for
being a mentor to me every step of the way. Terry Kaufman and John Justeson,
for hiring me to work on the Project for the Documentation of the Languages of
Mesoamerica; they are responsible for my decision to work on Huehuetla
Tepehua and not on some other language. Mark Ferguson, for knowing the
location of the appendix in the human body, for insisting that I see a doctor, and
for, essentially, saving my life. Terry Kaufman (again), for teaching me how to do
lexical field work the “right way” and Roberto Zavala, for teaching me to do it the
fun way. Tony Woodbury, for serving as the principle investigator on my NSF
Dissertation Improvement grant, and for providing invaluable advice and support
while I was applying for fellowships. Thomas Smith Stark at the Colegio de
México and Roberto Herrerra Herrerra, formerly of the Universidad de las
Américas – Puebla, for serving as co-sponsors for my Fulbright-García Robles
fellowship. Roberto Herrerra Herrerra (again) and Mandy Holzrichter, for easing
my culture shock during my time in Cholula. Thom Smith Stark (again), his wife
María, my fellow Fulbrighter Jennifer Jolly, and her husband Chris Gonzales, for
providing me with two homes in Mexico City away from the field where I could
go to decompress (and speak English!). Dottie Herzog, for sharing her
unpublished Tepehua dictionary, as well as other unpublished data that she hadvicompiled on the language, and also for sharing her workspace in Huehuetla while
mine was being built. Mark Sicolli, for being there in Catemaco. Christina Willis
and Lynda de Jong Boudreault, for being two of the best friends that I’ve had
during this long gradual process, and for being my only two friends who could
really, fully understood the journey. Suzanne Johnson, for showing me that there
was more to life than just graduate school and linguistics (with or without the kids
in tow).
My fieldwork was funded by the following sources, and I thank them all:
Fulbright IIE (Fulbright-García Robles Fellowship for scholars), the National
Science Foundation (NSF Grant No. 0078453 with Anthony C. Woodbury, PI),
the Pan American Round Tables of Texas (Melba Brunno Dawson Scholarship),
and the Project for the Documentation of the Languages of Mesoamerica.
Most importantly, I want to thank my committee: Nora England, Carlota
Smith, Megan Crowhurst, Tony Woodbury, Jim Watters, and Paulette Levy for all
of their helpful comments, advice, encouragement, and words of praise (those
kept me going more than anything!), not to mention their time, especially since
this grammar turned out to be a lot longer than I had anticipated. My biggest
thanks go to Nora, who has been the best supervisor and mentor that I could have
hoped for! Most importantly, she insisted that this grammar be a thorough
treatment of the language since it might be the only treatment that Huehuetla
Tepehua will ever get.viiA Descriptive Grammar of Huehuetla Tepehua
Publication No._____________Susan Smythe Kung, Ph.D.
The University of Texas at Austin, 2007Supervisor: Nora C. EnglandThis dissertation is a comprehensive description of the grammar of
Huehuetla Tepehua (HT), which is a member of the Totonacan language family.
HT is spoken by fewer than 1500 people in and around the town of Huehuetla,
Hidalgo, in the Eastern Sierra Madre mountains of the Central Gulf Coast region
of Mexico. This grammar begins with an introduction to the language, its
language family, and its setting, as well as a brief history of my contact with the
language. The grammar continues with a description of the phonology of HT,
followed by morphosyntactic and syntactic description of all of the major parts of
speech, including verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, and numbers; the grammar
concludes with a description of the sentence-level syntax. A compilation of
interlinearized texts appears in the appendix.
HT is a polysynthetic, head-marking language with complex verbal
morphology. Inflectional affixes include both prefixes and suffixes for which aviiitemplatic pattern is difficult to model. In addition to inflectional and derivational
morphology, HT verbs are also host to a large number of aspectual derivational
morphemes, each of which alters the meaning of the verb in a very specific way.
Plural marking on both nouns and verbs for any third person argument is optional
and determined by an animacy hierarchy, which is also used to determine verbal
argument marking in various morphosyntactic constructions. HT nouns are
completely unmarked for case, and certain nouns, including kinship terms and
parts of a whole, are obligatorily possessed. The order of the major constituents is
pragmatically determined, with a tendency towards VSO order in the absence of
pragmatic or contextual clues and SVO order in context-rich textual examples.
HT is an under-documented moribund language that is at imminent risk of
extinction within the next two-to-three generations. Thus, this dissertation is a
major contribution not only to the field of linguistics, but also to the Tepehua
people who might one day be interested in the language of their grandparents.ixTable of Contents

1.1 INTRODUCTION TO THE LANGUAGE
Tepehua is an under-documented, moribund, indigenous language that is
spoken in the Mexican towns of Huehuetla, Hidalgo and Mecapalapa Puebla.
Tepehua belongs to the Totonacan language family, which has two branches:
Tepehua and Totonac.1 The Totonacan languages are spoken in the Eastern Sierra
Madre mountain chain in the Central Gulf Coast region of Mexico where the
contiguous states of Hidalgo, Veracruz, and Puebla fit together like pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle. Illustration 1 is a map the geographical location of the Totonacan
language family within Mexico.

[T0020: 034-035]
In (809a), papaanin ‘men’ is the head of the relative clause; it is the noun
that is being modified by the relative clause. The head is co-indexical with the
non-overt subject of the dependent verb, ‘live’, and this grammatical relationship
is marked on the dependent verb by the third person plural subject prefix ta-. The
relativizer juu introduces the relative clause.
In (809b), there are actually two relative clauses—juu 7uputulhch
‘whoever wanted to eat it’ and juu jaantuch ‘whoever did not’—neither of which
modifies a head noun or noun phrase; instead the relative clause juu 7uputulhch
‘whoever wanted to eat it’ acts as the subject argument of the matrix verb 7ulhch
‘ate it’ and the relative clause juu jaantuch ‘whoever did not’ acts as the subject
of the elided verb of the negative verb phrase jaantuch ‘did not’. There are no590distinct relative pronouns in HT, and the relativizer juu introduces both relative
clauses.217
The Relativization Hierarchy in (810) shows the hierarchy of grammatical
roles (in a subordinate clause) that may be relativized in the world’s languages.218
All languages that have relative clauses allow relativization of the subordinate
subject. Different languages allow different grammatical roles to be relativized.
The grammatical roles in this hierarchy are ordered such that if a languages
allows relativization of a particular role, it will also allow relativization of all of
the roles to the left of it on the hierarchy. For example, if the possessor in a
subordinate clause (in a particular language) may be relativized, then all
grammatical roles to the left of the possessor on the hierarchy may also be
relativized in that language.
(810) Relativization Hierarchy
subject > direct object > indirect object > oblique > possessor
POSTNOMINAL
HEADLESSIn HT, the two types of relative clause (the post-nominal and the headless)
behave differently with respect to which grammatical role within the relative (i.e.,
subordinate) clause may be relativized. In the HT post-nominal relative clause, an
oblique argument—and all argument types to the left of it on the hierarchy—may
be relativized as a post-nominal relative clause. Of all of the post-nominal relative
217 The headless relative clause is a subtype of both relative clauses and complement clauses. Formore information on complement clauses, please see the next section.
218 Hierarchy proposed by Keenan and Comrie (1977), as cited in Payne (1997: 335).","[614, 615, 616]"
"26Recent work on Misantla Totonac includes a grammatical sketch (MacKay
and Trechsel 2005b) and an analysis of symmetrical (double) objects (MacKay
and Trechsel, to appear b). The same duo focused their attention on the Totonacan
language family at large in their analysis of the Totonacan reciprocal marker laa(MacKay and Trechsel 2003) and in symmetrical object-marking in Totonacan
(MacKay and Trechsel 2005a, 2006).
Finally, Teresa McFarland is writing a detailed overview of the phonology
and morphology of Filomeno Mata Totonac for her Ph.D. dissertation at the
University of California at Berkeley (in progress). She has analyzed the
inflectional system (2005) and the templatic morphology of ideophones (2006, to
appear).
1.5 OVERVIEW OF THE GRAMMAR
Chapter 2: Phonology presents the Huehuetla Tepehua phonemes and
their allophones, the practical orthography that I use to represent HT in all
subsequent chapters, a phonemic merger that is currently taking place in the
language, the syllable structure, rules for primary and secondary stress
assignment, general phonological processes that occur in the language, and
morphophonemic processes that affect the boundaries of particular morphemes.
I have put everything having to do with verbs into Chapter 3: Verbs and
Verbal Morphology. This chapter covers verbal inflectional morphology
(includingperson-markingandtense/aspect/mood),verbalderivationalmorphology (including valence-changing affixes, verb-compounding, and
apectual derivational affixes), existential verbs, positional and postural verbs, the
27copula, periphrastic verbal constructions such as the auxiliary-like verb laa ‘can’
and infinitival phrases that are used to convey the periphrastic future and the
progressive and inchoative aspects.
Similarly, I have put everything to do with nouns into Chapter 4: Nouns
and Nominal Morphology. Not only does this chapter include nominal inflectional
morphology (pluralization and possession) and derivational morphology (deriving
nouns from nouns and nouns from verbs), it also includes syntactic information
relevant to the noun phrase, relational noun constructions, and pronouns.
Chapter 5: Modifiers is quite small. It includes discussion of the HT
quantifiers and adjectives. The adjective section is subdivided further into
adjectival inflection and adjectival derivation.
Chapter 6: Adverbs includes quantifiers used adverbially, prepositions,
and adverbs. Sub-topics under adverbs include temporal, locative, and manner
adverbs, adverbial particles, and adverbial clitics. Manner adverbs can be further
divided into ideophonic and non-ideophonic manner adverbs. Finally, this chapter
includes discussion of the derivational prefix lhii-, which creates a directional
adverb from an adverb or adjective.
Numbers and numeral affixes are discussed in Chapter 7: Numbers.
Subtopics in this chapter include cardinal numbers, ordinal numbers, numeral
classifiers, numeral inflection, and the counting of days.
Syntactic analysis of HT is found in Chapter 8: Syntax. Topics discussed
in this chapter include word order of major constituents, focus, interrogation,
negation, comparative and superlative constructions, and complex clauses. The28complex clauses are divided into coordination and subordination, the latter of
which is further divided into relative clauses, complement clauses, adverbial
clauses, and conditional clauses.
Finally, the grammar concludes with an appendix that consists of six fully
interlinearized and analyzed HT narrative texts.
Though I have tried to include as much information about Huehuetla
Tepehua as possible in this grammar, there will always be more that could be
added. However, the most obvious omission from this grammar is an analysis of
HT discourse. Because of time constraints, I have chosen not to include a chapter
dedicated to discourse. However, if one reads the other chapters closely, s/he will
find bits of information about the discourse dispersed throughout the grammar.","[51, 52, 53, 54]"

A complex clause in HT may involve subordination (section 8.6.1) or
coordination (section 8.6.2) of clauses.
8.6.1 Subordination
Subordinate clauses in HT have in common three features: (i) the
subordinate clause is always introduced by a complementizer, relativizer, or
adverbial relative pronoun,215 (ii) the verb of the subordinate clause is always
finite, and (iii) no particular or special morphology is associated with
subordination, either on the matrix or the subordinate verb. Types of subordinate
clause found in HT and covered in this section include relative clauses (8.6.1.1),
complement clauses (8.6.1.2), adverbial clauses (8.6.1.3), and conditional clauses
(8.6.1.4). The word order of the major constituents is the same in the subordinate
clause as it is in the matrix clause; that is, the two preferred word orders are VSO
and SVO.

order to create a vowel-final environment in which perfective lateral
neutralization can happen. Also, perfective nasal deletion must precede stress
assignment in order for the penult to bear stress in the perfective aspect69 and to
feed the /h/-deletion rule. It is followed by compensatory lengthening, which
assigns the mora of the deleted moraic /n/ to the preceding vowel. Derivations
appears in (191).

3.1 INFLECTION
Inflectional categories in HT include nominative and accusative person
and number, as well as tense, aspect, and mood. Inflection is accomplished by
means of affixation, glottalization, deletion, and suppletion of the verb stem.
3.1.1 Person and Number Marking
Person and number are co-referenced on the Tepehua verb by prefixation,
suffixation, glottalization, and suppletion. Person marking consists of first,
second, and third; number consists of singular, simple plural, multiple plural, and
first person plural inclusive and exclusive. The categories of third person and
singular are not marked overtly on the verb; instead they are the default readings
when there is no overt person or number morphology on the verb stem. Given that
there is no case marking on the noun in HT and that there is only one set of free
pronouns, grammatical relationships in HT are distinguished by means of word
order of the major constituents, discourse pragmatics, and pronominal crossreferencing on the verb. The word order (which is both pragmatic and relatively
fixed) is discussed in chapter 8, section 8.1. Pronominal cross-referencing is the
topic of this section.
Person marking in Tepehua follows a predominantly accusative pattern.
On a transitive verb, nominative person markers co-index subjects: a first person
subject is shown in the example in (192a), a second person subject is shown in
(192b), and a third person plural subject is shown in (192c).

[T0003: 005]HT displays split-intransitivity (Merlan 1985) in its alignment system.
According to Dixon’s (1994) types of split system, the split found in HT is
conditioned by the semantics of the nominal referent. While first and second
person subjects of intransitive verbs are always co-indexed with nominative
person markers, as seen in the examples in (194a) and (194b), only animate third
person plural subjects of intransitive verbs are co-indexed with nominative person
markers, as seen in the example in (194c). An inanimate third person plural
subject is co-indexed with the plural marker lak-, as seen in the example in
(194d). This split is clearly conditioned by the animacy of the plural third person
subject.

marking (Section 3.1.1.3), accusative person marking (Section 3.1.1.4), indefinite
object and plural indefinite and indirect object marking (Section 3.1.1.5), double
object marking (Section 3.1.1.6), speech act participant marking (Section 3.1.1.7),
and split-intransitivity (Section 3.1.1.8). All person and number markers covered
in this section are summarized at the end in Section 3.1.1.9.
3.1.1.1 Nominative Marking
HT nominative marking consists of first person singular, plural inclusive,
and plural exclusive; second person singular and plural; and third person plural.
Third person singular is not overtly marked.
First Person
A first person singular subject is indicated on the verb by the prefix k(~ 7ik-), as seen below in (195a). A first person plural inclusive subject is
indicated on the verb by the suffix –w (~ -aw after a consonant or semi-vowel), as
seen below in (195b). A first person plural exclusive subject is doubly marked by
both the prefix k- and the suffix –w, as seen below in (195c).

‘We (EXCL) call it ‘snake’.’[T0009: 012]Herzog (1974) gives ic-, where <c> represents /k/, as the first person
prefix (p. 45). However, only the eldest of my consultants used 7ik-, and he did so
only in elicited speech at the beginning of a phrase when the addition of k- alone
would have caused an dispreferred consonant cluster70 and only after I had asked
him to repeat himself.
However, despite the fact that this consultant consistently used 7ik- during
elicitation, I do not have a single occurrence of him or anyone else using it in
naturally occurring speech. I do not know if this omission represents a gap in the
data (i.e., I simply did not happen to record anyone making such an emphatic
reference) or if it means that the 7ik- allomorph of the first person prefix does not
occur in discourse. However, I think that it is clear that 7ik- is used only by the
older speakers and only for emphasis.
Furthermore, it is quite common for speakers to omit the first person
prefix altogether when the subject is first person singular and when the context
makes it clear that the subject is first person singular. The example in (196a) is
part of a first person narration from a traditional story. Though the gloss says ‘I
killed it’, the verb maqniilhch is not marked for first person and literally means
‘He killed it’. If the k- prefix had been affixed to the verb in this example, it
would have been syllabified as the coda of the preceding particle waa. The verb in
(196b) does not bear the first person subject prefix either, but it does bear prefixes

In an HT topicalized construction, a noun, noun phrase, or pronoun that is
the topic of the clause occurs in clause-initial position. When the topic is also the
subject of the matrix clause, it is separated from the rest of the clause by the
complementizer nii, as seen below in the examples in (743). I assum that nii
intervenes between the subject and the verb in order to distinguish a topicalized
construction from a normal clause with SVO word order. In these examples, the
topicalized element is enclosed in square brackets, and the complementizer
appears in bold type.

In HT, the prefix 7a- (PL.INO) is used to co-index an understood plural
third person object on a verb stem in which the object has been backgrounded or
detransitivized in some way; examples are shown in (237) and (238). In each
example in (237), the transitive verb bears the indefinite object suffix –nVn,
which backgrounds the direct object. In the example in (238a), the transitive verb
has been detransitivized by means of the reciprocal prefix laa- (see Section
3.2.1.2), and the transitive verb in (238b) has been detransitivized by the reflexive
suffix
-kan (see Section 3.2.1.1).

The prefix 7a- is also used to co-index a plural indirect object. In most—

examples, 7a- precedes lak-, indicating that it is not co-indexing a plural
indefinite object in these instances. Most of the cases in which 7a- and lak- cooccur involve ditransitive verbs of telling—such as jun ‘tell’, sakmin ‘ask’, and
lhiijun ‘order’—that have a plural third person indirect object, shown below in
204(242). Note that when the third person indirect object is singular, “tell” verbs are

[T0066: 052]The combination of 7a- and lak- also occurs in constructions that have
only one object; in these constructions, the object argument is less animate than
the subject argument. The animacy hierarchy shown in (244) is based on the
Person Hierarchy first introduced in example (213) of Section 3.1.1.3. The
animacy hierarchy is almost identical to the person hierarchy, but it further
205divides third person plural into animate and inanimate. Again first and second
person arguments are equal to each other, and they outrank third person animate
arguments, which in turn outrank third person inanimate arguments.
(244) HT Animacy Hierarchy
1st & 2nd person >> 3rd person plural animate >> 3rd person plural inanimate
In the following example in (245a), the plural object lapanák ‘people’ is more
animate than the nominal argument chiiwx ‘rock(s)’, and it is co-indexed on the
verb by the combination of 7a- and lak-. Since the subject chiiwx ‘rock(s)’ is
inanimate, it is not obligatorily marked for plurality, and since it is less animate
than the object, it is not co-indexed on the verb. When the animacy of the subject
is greater than or equal to that of the object, then the plural subject is co-indexed
on the verb by ta- and the plural object is co-indexed on the verb by lak-, as seen
in (245b).

‘They measured them [people or clothing].’[Qlak1][TPWDB]The animacy hierarchy can also be used to explain the presence of both
7a- and lak- on the verbs of telling shown above in (242). In these constructions,
the indirect object (a plural group of people) is more animate than the direct
object (which is the statement being communicated). Thus, the animacy hierarchy
206is relevant not just with respect to distinguishing the subject and the object, but
the indirect object as well (see also Section 3.1.1.6 on Double Object Marking).
When the animacy of the indefinite subject is unknown (or not relevant),
the prefixes 7alak- and lak- may be used interchangeably, as seen below in (246).
Both of these examples come from the same story, and they both were uttered by
the same consultant. In the story, the ‘someone’ who removed the protagonists
from the cave is some sort of quasi-human devil or spirit whose animacy is
questionable.

Watters 1988 (pp. 329-331). According to Watters, the prefix 7a- is the default to
co-index a plural third person object in HT, and the prefix lak- only co-occurs
with 7a- in HT. However, my analysis of HT 7a- and lak- is more consistent with
Watters’ analysis of the cognate prefixes in Tlachichilco Tepehua, where “lakmarks ‘third plural (syntactic) object’, while ha:- marks ‘third plural unspecified
object’” (p. 331). Watters goes on to state that ha:- in Tlachichilco Tepehua
additionally indicates “multiple action” of the verb, but my data indicate that lakand not 7a- indicates distributive or repeated action of the verb in HT.","[225, 226, 227, 228, 229, 230, 231, 232]"

‘The fish (PL) stunk.’[TPWDB]HT split intransitivity can be modeled using the animacy hierarchy that
was introduced in example (244) of Section 3.1.1.5 and that is repeated below in
(260). First and second persons are equal to each other, and they outrank third
person animate arguments, which in turn outrank third person inanimate
arguments. With respect to split intransitivity, the pivot point occurs between
third person animate and inanimate; first, second, and third plural animate
subjects are co-indexed on the verb by nominative morphology, while third
person plural inanimates are co-indexed on the verb by the “accusative” prefix
lak-.
(260) HT Animacy Hierarchy and Split Intransitivity
1st & 2nd person >> 3rd person plural animate >> 3rd person plural inanimate
>>
Above I called this pattern an “emerging” one because I believe that this is
relatively new pattern in HT for various reasons. First, no other documented
Totonacan language exhibits patterns of syntactic or morphosyntactic split
217alignment or split intransitivity; instead they are all documented as being strictly
accusative in their syntax and morphology.
Second, the pattern of split intransitivity in Huehuetla Tepehua is an
elusive one because inanimate nominals are not obligatorily marked for plurality
nor are inanimate arguments obligatorily co-indexed on the verb. Furthermore,
though the pattern manifested itself in utterances that were spontaneously
produced by my consultants, it did not always emerge from—or withstand the test
of—elicited grammaticality judgments. I first found the split-intransitive pattern
in sentences that were spontaneously produced by my consultants; when I tried to
test the pattern during elicited grammaticality judgments, I found that in most
cases, both patterns (a strictly accusative one and a split one) were acceptable. For
example, my consultant had given me the example in (261a), in which the
intransitive verb is marked with lak-. Later, I offered the example in (261b), in
which the same verb is marked with ta-, and the example in (261c), in which the
verb is marked with both ta- and lak-. My consultant accepted both examples, and
he told me that all three have the same meaning.

consultant produced the example in (262b), with the same verb again marked with

examples in (261b) and (261c) are grammatical while the example in (262c) is
not. And, if I asked the same set of questions of the same consultant on a different

currently do not have answers.

ART PREP-hill[Qlak1]Third, as is pointed out in the literature on grammaticalization,
polysemous morphemes may give rise to grammatical change in a language (e.g.,
Heine, Claudi, and Hünnemeyer 1991; Hopper and Traugott 2003). The prefix
219lak- exhibits more polysemy than any other morpheme in Huehuetla Tepehua: this
prefix is used (i) to indicate multiple plurality of the subject of an intransitive
verb, as seen above in section 3.1.1.2, (ii) to indicate distributive action of a verb,
also seen in section 3.1.1.2, (iii) to co-index a third person plural object, as seen in
section 3.1.1.4, (iv) to mark plurality on inanimate and animate nouns (see
Chapter 4), and (v) to marked plurality on adjectives (see Chapter 5).
Fourth, the use of the prefix lak- as a verbal plural marker overlaps with
the use of 7a- as a verbal plural marker. There is evidence from Watters 1988 that
in Huehuetla Tepehua, the prefix 7a- was the default prefix to co-index a third
person plural object and that the prefix lak- sometimes co-occurred with 7a- and
sometimes did not. In my own data, the reverse is true in that (i) lak- co-indexes a
plural third person object, (ii) 7a- co-indexes an understood plural object on a
detransitivized verb and an indirect object, (iii) the two co-occur to co-index a
plural third person indirect object and/or a plural third person direct object if it
outranks the subject in animacy, and (iv) the two frequently co-occur without any
overt change in the meaning. Next, the use of lak- as a marker of distributivity
overlaps with the meanings of two HT suffixes: -pala, which marks repetitive
action of the verb (see Section 3.2.3.7) and –qoju, which indicates that the action
of the verb is distributed equally over all members of either the subject or object
argument, depending on the transitivity of the verb (see Section 3.2.3.9).
Finally, HT is a moribund language. The children are not learning it, their
parents do not use it, and their grandparents address them in Spanish and speak
Tepehua only amongst themselves. Once a language falls into disuse, the rate of220grammatical and phonological change escalates. I believe that this is what is
happening in HT. Given the polysemy of the morpheme lak-, plus the fact that HT
has other morphemes that provide similar (or the same) meanings as lak-, it is
quite possible that HT is undergoing a grammatical change that might result in an
unquestionable split in its alignment system.
3.1.1.9 Summary of Person Marking Inflection
The nominative person marking affixes are summarized in Table 13, and
the accusative affixes are summarized in Table 14. Note that several of the affixes
have one meaning when used for nominative inflection and a slightly different
meaning when used as accusative inflection; these affixes are shown in bold in the
tables.

In order to test this conclusion, I conducted a sociolinguistic survey in
Huehuetla in the spring of 2001; I first reported the results of this survey in a
unpublished presentation that I gave at the 2002 Annual Meeting of the Society
for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas (Smythe 2002), and I
summarize them here. Using a small set of sources (Arana 1953; Herzog no date;
and Kryder 1987), as well as my own field notes, I created a list of 44 lexemes
that contained either a glottal stop, a plain uvular stop, and/or a glottalized uvular
stop. This list of lexemes, along with the source where I found each lexeme, is
shown below in Table 7. I recorded this list of words with 24 native HT speakers
between the ages of 15 and 82 (8 males and 16 females). I recorded each word
two times with each speaker so that I would have two tokens of each lexeme. My
findings are summarized below the table.","[92, 93]"
"Illustration 8: Building a “Linguistic Facility”
During my time in Huehuetla, I utilized a discourse-centered approach to
data collection (Sherzer 1987) in order to understand how and for what purposes
HT-speakers use their language in their daily lives. I tried to be a participant in, as
well as an observer of, the community; I took my mini-disk recorder with me
everywhere that I went (along with several of my NSF consent forms), and
15recorded as often as possible. A discourse-centered approach to research is a
crucial component of descriptive linguistic research because one-on-one
elicitation does not produce naturally occurring speech.","[40, 41]"

[T0066: 245][ELIEX3: 060]7.3 NUMERAL CLASSIFIERS
Huehuetla Tepehua has a rich system of numeral classifiers; however,
today the numeral classification system is falling into disuse, with more and more
HT speakers using only the two most common classifiers: the general classifier
laqa- and the human classifier puma-. The HT classifier system is prototypical
(Aikhenvald 2000) in many respects: a classifier forms a constituent with a
number or quantifier, and it serves to categorize the entity or action that the
number or quantifier modifies according to its shape, humanness, or some other
criteria; there is a ‘generic’ classifier that can be used instead of a more specific
one; there is no obligatory plural agreement marking on nouns or verbs; and there
are both sortal and mensurative classifiers.
In the exercise of counting, HT classifiers are obligatory on the numbers
one through 39, and they are optional beginning with the number 40. According
to Aikhenvald (2000), it is quite common for numeral classifier to be used
obligatorily with “small” numbers and optionally with “larger” numbers (p. 100).
Given that only the native HT numbers one through five occur in my field
recordings, I am unable to determine if the classifiers are obligatory on numbers
greater than five in contexts other than counting.
489The HT numeral classifier system has been described previously by Bower
(1948); however, I found the meanings associated with many of the classifiers to
be slightly different than those given in Bower 1948. Additionally, I found several
classifiers that Bower did not mention.185 I suspect that the numeral classifier
system was once larger and more productive than either Bower or I found it to be.
The classifiers and their usage are presented in section 7.3.1 and the use of body
part prefixes as classifiers is discussed in section 7.3.2.
7.3.1 Numeral Classifiers and Their Usage
The semantics and typology of the HT numeral classifier system is
presented in section 7.3.1.1, the syntactic behavior of the classifiers is discussed
in section 7.3.1.2, and the pragmatics of the use of classifiers is examined in
7.3.1.3.
7.3.1.1 Semantics and Typology of Numeral Classifiers
Many researchers have made typologies of the classification of nouns,
including Allan (1977), Aikhenvald (2000, 2004), and Grinevald (2000). I have
not strictly adopted any one of these typologies, but rather I have been influenced
by aspects of each of them in the categorization of the HT classifiers. The HT
classifiers can be divided into five groups: (i) the general classifier laqa-, which
can be used in place of any of the other classifiers; (ii) the human classifier
puma-, which is the default classifier to use with any human entity; (iii) classifiers
that measure entities (the Mensuratives); (iv) classifiers that sort entities based on
their inherent characteristics (the Sortals); and (v) classifiers that function only
185 Bower (1948) lists only nine distinct numeral classifiers, while I have found 26 (see Table 2).","[511, 512, 513, 514, 515]"

[Q7]Classified numerals and quantifiers can occur as anaphors that refer to
some previously mentioned noun. According to Aikhenvald (2004), “all
classifiers are used anaphorically, that is, as proforms, for tracking referents in
discourse” (p. 110). In (712c), the classified quantifier pumalhuu is an anaphoric
expression that refers back to the noun lapanák that was mentioned in the
question in (711b); in (712b), the classified number laqat'uy anaphorically refers
to the beer that is the topic of the conversation from which this example is taken;
and in (712c), laqlhuu (a predicate adjective) anaphorically refers back to some
pesos (money) that were previously mentioned in the discourse.

‘They are going to come.’ / ‘They will come.’[TPWDB]3.1.1.2 Multiple Plural and Distributive Marking
The plural prefix lak- is used to distinguish a simple plural argument (that
is, a plural argument that consists of two or three entities) from a multiple plural
argument (a plural argument that consists of more than three entities); the
examples in (204) through (206) demonstrate this use. The same prefix is also
used to co-index a third person plural object on a transitive verb, as will be shown
in Section 3.1.1.4. In all of these examples in (204), (205), and (206), the stative
verb yaa ‘standing’ has a single argument that is plural; in (204) the argument is
first person plural exclusive, in (205) the argument is second person plural, and in
(206) the argument is third person plural. All of the (a) examples demonstrate the
simple plural, which consists of two to three entities; these examples bear the
nominal subject morphology that was discussed above in Section 3.1.1.1. The (b)
examples demonstrate the multiple plural, which consists of more than three
entities; all of these examples bear the same nominal subject morphology seen in
the (a) examples, as well as the plural prefix lak-.

[Qlak1]Multiple plurality is not obligatorily marked on the HT verb, as can be
seen from the examples in (207), which come from the same narrative. In all the
examples, the noun referent of the third person plural argument of each of the
verbs is a large group of thieves. While the intransitive verbs in (207a) and (207c)
are both marked for multiple plurality, neither the intransitive nor the transitive
verbs in (207b) or (207d) are marked for multiple plurality, even though the third
person plural argument is the same noun referent for all of them.

‘They went and they left all of their money.’[T0055: 079]Another possible analysis of the examples in (207a) and (207c) is that the
prefix lak- does not indicate multiple plurality of the verb’s argument here, but
that instead it indicates distributive action of the verb in which the action applies
equally to all members of the plural argument. Furthermore, it seems that the
argument does not need to be plural in order for the action to be distributive, as
seen in the examples in (208). In both of these examples, the action of the verb
applies to the entirety of the sole verbal argument.

‘It (her skin) all fell off.’[T0057: 079]The distinction between simple and multiple plural has not been
documented in any of the other members of the Totonacan language family.
However, the use of a cognate morpheme to indicate distributive verbal action is
widely documented within the family (e.g., Upper Necaxa Totonac (Beck 2004),
Papantla Totonac (Levy p.c.), Misantla Totonac (MacKay 1999), Coatepec
Totonac (McQuown 1990)).
3.1.1.3 Indefinite Subject Marking
An indefinite subject in Huehuetla Tepehua is indicated by the suffix
–kan.72 Though native speakers of both HT and Spanish sometimes translate the
HT indefinite subject construction into the reflexive passive construction in
Spanish, it is more often the case that they translate it as the impersonal or
indefinite third person plural subject ‘they’. Whereas the passive construction
promotes an object argument to the subject position, the indefinite subject
construction in Tepehua serves to foreground the object and background the
subject without changing their semantic roles, as seen below in the example in
(209). In this example, the prefix lak- (which is underlined) co-references a third
person plural object, and –kan (which is in bold type) co-references an indefinite
subject.","[207, 208, 209, 210, 211]"
"299[T0057: 069][T0057: 014]The cognate of this suffix has a variety of names in the Totonacan
literature, including ‘terminative’ (McQuown 1990: 183), ‘completive’ (Watters
1988: 226; MacKay 1999: 335), and ‘all, completely’ (Beck 2004: 74).
3.2.3.10 Distal -chaa and Proximal -chii
Distal (distant from speaker, ‘there’) and proximal (close to speaker,
‘here’) location may be indicated on the verb by the suffixes –chaa and –chii,
respectively.112 The distal –chaa historically comes from the verb chaa7an ‘arrive
there’. While the root verb chaa7an indicates motion away from the speaker or
some reference point already established in the discourse, the suffix –chaa refers
to a location distant from the speaker. Similarly, the proximal –chii historically
comes from the verb chin ‘arrive here’. The verb chin indicates motion towards
the speaker or some reference point already established in the discourse, while the
suffix –chii indicates a location close to the speaker.
There is conflicting data in HT regarding the morphological order of these
suffixes. Some of HT examples indicate that –chaa and –chii follow the aspectual
markers, as seen below in the examples in (390). Other examples indicate that –
chaa and –chii precede the perfective aspectual suffix, shown below in (391). In
yet other examples, it is not possible to determine morpheme order because
perfective aspect is not overtly marked, as seen below in (392).113
112 Interestingly, distal –chaa occurs more frequently in my data than proximal –chii does.
113 Jim Watters has suggested to me that the distal and proximal suffixes follow the perfect aspect
marker (–ta), the imperfective aspect marker (-y ~ -‘a), and the future tense marker (-ya7 ~ -a7).
Though I would tend to agree with him, I do not have the necessary data to back this analysis up.
The example in (390a) has the morpheme –palh, which is an allomorph of –pala REP that occurs
only in the perfective aspect. However, this morpheme is not an aspect marker, and it is most
likely the case that this example reflects the order of the distal suffix –chaa with respect to the
repetitive marker –pala and not with respect to perfective aspect.","[324, 325]"
"23In addition to verbs and nouns, HT also has a separate class of both
adjectives and adverbs, some of which are full words, but others of which are
particles.
HT is interesting from a phonological perspective for at least two reasons.
There is a word-final process of devoicing that affects not only vowels, but also
the liquid /l/, which is prohibited from occurring in coda position. When
morphophonological processes occur that would force /l/ into a coda position, it
neutralizes with the voiceless lateral fricative phoneme //. Next, a second person
subject is marked on the verb through the laryngealization of stops and affricates;
in some cases, a second person subject is doubly marked by laryngealization as
well as suffixation.
1.4 REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE
MacKay (1999) provides a thorough review of all of the linguistic
literature on Totonac and Tepehua spanning from the colonial vocabularies and
grammars of Olmos (1547) and Zambrano Bonilla (1752) and ending with her
own work from the 1990s. Because her review is so thorough, I refer the reader
to that source for reference to anything written before 1997 about Totonac,
Tepehua, or the Totonacan language family. This review of the literature picks up
where MacKay’s left off.
In fact, since the publication of MacKay’s (1999) grammar of Misantla
Totonac, we seem to have entered the golden age of Totonacan research,
especially with respect to the Tepehua branch of the family. Just two decades ago,
the only member of the Tepehua branch to have been documented was the
24Tlachichilco variety (Watters 1980, 1984, 1987, 1988, 1994, 1996a, 1996b). The
only published materials on Huehuetla Tepehua were a 1976 translation of the
New Testament by the Liga Bíblica Mundial de Hogar, several short stories
written by SIL consultants and published by the SIL, Kryder’s (1987) Masters
thesis, which is a sketch of the HT phonology and morphology, and three short
linguistics articles by SIL linguists that either describe or analyze HT numerals
(Bower 1948), HT sentences (Bower and Erickson 1967), and HT verbal
inflection (Herzog 1974).
My own work on HT includes acoustic analysis of uvular stops, glottal
stops, and vowels (Smythe 2000, 2002), reconstruction of uvular stops (Smythe
2003), description and analysis of “affectionate speech”, sound symbolism, and
ideophones in HT (Smythe 2003; Smythe Kung 2005a, 2005c), external
possession or possessor ascension (Smythe Kung 2004), Spanish loanwords
(Smythe Kung 2005b), numeral classifiers (Smythe Kung 2006a, 2007), and split
intransitivity (Smythe Kung 2006b).
Pisaflores Tepehua was a completely undocumented language two decades
ago, but today the work on this language includes not only Hernández Sierra’s
(1986) ENAH thesis on the history of the Tepehua people of Pisaflores and the
phonemes of the language, but also several SIL-published stories in the language
that are available on-line through the SIL and Ethnologue websites, as well as two
forthcoming linguistic descriptions of the language: a grammatical sketch
(MacKay and Trechsler, to appear c) and a phonological sketch (MacKay and
Trechsel, to appear a).","[48, 49, 50]"

"ID-similar.verbv.maa-ID-ni
CAUS-ID-DATThe first morphological frame derives an intransitive verb stem from an
ideophone by means of affixation of the indefinite object suffix -nVn, plus the
plural indefinite object prefix 7a- ; the meaning of the derived verb is based on
that of the affect word. The frame is shown above in (601i). Beck (in press b: 13)
lists some examples of intransitive verbs comprised of affect words bearing the
–nVn suffix in Upper Necaxa Totonac, so this process is not unique to Huehuetla
Tepehua. HT examples are shown below in (602) and (603). In example (602a),
the ideophone jaw ‘howl’ appears in the adverbial position immediately preceding
the verb najun ‘say’; in example (602b) the same ideophone is used as the verb
root, to which the indefinite object prefix and suffix are affixed.

affixed with the indefinite object prefix and suffix.

[TPWDB: p'uks]The second morphological frame creates a transitive or intransitive verb
stem by compounding an ideophone and the auxiliary verb laa ‘can’; the frame is
shown above in (601ii). The resulting derived verb stem means to perform the
action of the ideophone. The valency of the verb is dependent on pragmatic
constraints of the ideophone. It is clear from the examples below in (604) and
(605) that the ideophone and the auxiliary verb form a compound unit because
they are prefixed with the past tense marker xa- ~ x- and suffixed with the
imperfective aspect marker –y.

[TPWDB: lomp’a]In the third morphological frame, the ideophone is compounded with the
verb nawii ‘do’ or ‘make’ to form either a transitive or an intransitive stem,
according to the pragmatic constraints of the ideophone. The template is shown
above in (601iii), and examples are shown in (606) and (607). The resulting IDnawii stem has a meaning that is the same as or nearly the same as the meaning as
the ID-laa stem (compare (606) to (604b) and compare (607) to (605b)). The
verbs laa ‘can’ and nawii ‘do, make’ are both semantically general, and both can
be described as ‘light’ or ‘empty’ verbs that have very little inherent meaning.
Regardless of the semantics of laa and nawii, in all of these examples, the derived
stem means to perform some sort of action based on the meaning of the
ideophone. Furthermore, these two frames may be used only with ideophones that
refer to actions.

to the ideophone; the frame is shown above in (601iv). Examples are shown
below in (608) and (609). In all of the examples, the HT ideophone corresponds to
the direct object in the English translation.

[TPWDB: lomp’a]In the fifth and final morphological frame, an ideophone is affixed with
the causative prefix maa- and the dative suffix –ni; the frame is shown above in
(601v). The resulting meaning of the derived stem is to make something or
someone else perform the action or sound of the ideophone. Examples are shown
below in (610).

[PDLMA2005]Though all five frames are productive processes, not all ideophones may
participate in all of the frames due to pragmatic constraints. For example, an
445ideophone that describes a sound may not be used in Frame 2 (ID-laa) or Frame 3
(ID-nawii), as seen in the examples below in (611). Furthermore, I found no
corresponding morphological frame in which only sound-based (onomatopoeic)
ideophones may be used. To date, I have not investigated the pragmatics of
ideophones and their morphological frames beyond this rather general observation
regarding the ideophones based on sound and action.

Like the ideophonic manner adverbs, non-ideophonic manner adverbs also
precede the verb, as seen in the examples below in (612). Both the (a) and the (b)
examples are acceptable word orders because the adverbial phrase naa k’us ‘very
pretty’ precedes the verb; the (c) example is unacceptable because the adverbial
phrase follows the verb without occurring clause-finally.

(Intended reading: ‘The hill looks very pretty.’)[tasuy]V[MNB13: 40]However, the pre-verbal word order of the non-ideophonic manner
adverbs is not as strict as that of the ideophonic adverbs. If another adverb occurs
in the position immediately preceding the verb, the manner adverb may occur at
the end of the clause. The example in (613a) shows the manner adverbial phrase
naa qox ‘very well’ in the pre-verbal position. In (613b) a temporal adverb,
p’ulhnan ‘first’, occurs in this pre-verbal position, and the manner adverbial
phrase naa qox occurs at the end of the clause.

8.2.2 Focus Particle waa
The HT focus particle waa precedes a pragmatically emphasized element
in a clause without directly influencing the element’s location within the clause. It
serves to highlight or draw attention to a clausal constituent. It most commonly
occurs before a verb, before a predicate nominal or adjective, and before the
answer to a wh-word question. However, it also occurs before other clausal
elements, as will be seen below.
The most obvious place in which one finds a focused element is in the
answer to a wh-word question. The focused constituent of the answer is the part of
the clause or phrase that plays the same grammatical role as the wh-word in the
corresponding question, as seen in the examples below in (748) through (751).207
These answers are actually doubly focused because they are preceded by waa and
they occur in clause-initial focus position. In the question in (748a), one person
asks another where he was. The answer in (748b), lak José Pollo ‘at José Pollo’s207 Please see Section 8.3 of this chapter for more information on interrogative structures.","[576, 577, 578, 579]"

Papantla Totonac, Upper Necaxa Totonac, Misantla Totonac, and Filomeno Mata
Totonac. The closed ‘parts’ class in Papantla Totonac has been the particular
focus of attention by Levy (1999a, 1999b, 2003, 2004), who has also analyzed
applicatives (2002a), specifiers and determiners (2002b), and relational nouns
(2006) in the language. Enriquez (2004) categorized words for odors in Papantla
Totonac.
Upper Necaxa Totonac (UNT)—also known as Patla-Chicontla Totonac—
is now widely documented due to the Upper Necaxa Field Project II: The
Structure and Acquisition of an Endangered, Indigenous Language, directed by
Dr. David Beck and funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research
Council of Canada. Publications and presentations that have resulted from Dr.
Beck’s research on UNT include a grammatical sketch of the language (Beck
2004), an analysis of UNT adjectives (Beck 1999, 2000, 2002), verbal paradigms
and person-marking hierarchies (Beck 2003), diachronic and synchronic phonetic
and phonological analysis of a rare class of ejective fricatives found in UNT
(Beck 2006b), agreement in multi-object constructions (Beck 2006a, 2006c),
ideophones and adverbs (Beck to appear a, to appear b), and an investigation of
extreme head-marking patterns within the language (Beck 2007). Other
publications or presentations that have resulted from Beck’s project include an
examination of language loss (Beck and Lam in press) and first language
acquisition of locative constructions (Varela 2006).","[50, 51]"

syllable is the only type of syllable that attracts primary stress in word-final
position; verbs ending in any of the other syllable types (CVV, CVO, and CV)
have penultimate stress. This stress pattern is not so obvious with respect to the
class of adjectives because the final syllable of an adjective may belong to one of
only two syllable types: the heavy type CVS, as seen in the examples in (90), or
the light type CV, as seen in the examples in (91). The other two possible syllable
types (CVO and CVV) do not occur word-finally in adjectives. The CVS-final
adjectives have ultimate stress, while the CV-final adjectives have penultimate
stress.

Though body part prefixes do occur on adjectives, I have found no
examples in which a final syllable ending in something other than a sonorant
consonant was stressed in order to avoid stressing the BPP. The only singlesyllable adjective that I found which may be prefixed with a BPP is qay /qaj/
‘big’, which ends in a sonorant consonant, so it receives primary stress. In all
other examples of adjectives prefixed with BPPs that I have found, the adjective is
at least two syllables long, so there is no stress conflict. Examples are shown in
(92).

"4Illustration 3: Huehuetla, Hidalgo, Mexico
Almost all HT-speakers are bilingual in Spanish. At the time of my
fieldwork, I met two women who were monolingual in HT; both of them where in
their 90s, and both of them lived in the remotest part of Barrio Atzlán. Everyone
else I met was bilingual in HT and Spanish, and many of the older men were
multilingual in HT, Spanish, Totonac, and Otomí. With respect to the younger
generations, I met only two teenagers who actively spoke HT (as well as Spanish)
in the home: a 14 year old girl and a 15 year old boy. I do not mean to imply that
these two teenagers were Tepehua-dominant, because they were not; they used
Tepehua (as well as Spanish) only with their parents and grandparents, and they
switched to Spanish with everyone else. All of the other young adults, teenagers,
and children that I met chose to speak only Spanish in the home, even though
many or most of them understood HT.
5I met only one HT-dominant couple who spoke to their young toddler and
pre-school aged children in HT; everyone else addressed their children and
grandchildren in Spanish. Since I left the village, a teacher’s college has been
constructed there, which has caused the non-HT-speaking population to increase
and has lead to even more intermarriage between Tepehua and non-Tepehua,
thereby reducing even more the likelihood that HT will be passed on to future
generations. English—but not Tepehua—is taught in the local middle and high
schools, and more and more people want to learn English in order to emigrate to
the United States of America.
Otomí is spoken in many of the ranches and towns that are a part of the
Huehuetla Municipio. On Market day, when people come from the outlying areas
to do business, it is quite common to hear Otomí, as well as Tepehua, spoken in
the town. The town of Huehuetla is a Tepehua island surrounded by a sea of
Otomí. Outside the Huehuetla Municipio boundaries, going east towards the Gulf
Coast, both Totonac and Nahuatl are spoken. Many of the older Tepehua men
who had left Huehuetla to work (and then returned) were multilingual in Totonac,
Otomí, Tepehua, and—of course—Spanish. However, I did not meet an HT
speaker who claimed to know Nahuatl, too.
The HT autonyms are Maqalhqama7 [maqaqama] ‘Tepehua people’
and Lhiimaqalhqama7 [imaqaqama] ‘Tepehua language’. In general, HT
speakers are not aware that there are two other varieties of Tepehua or that there
are Tepehua speakers in or around Tlachichilco or Pisaflores, both of which are in
the state of Veracruz. Both of these groups have their own autonyms to refer to6their language: Lhiimaasipijni /imasipihni/ or Liimaasipijni /limasipihni/ in
Tlachichilco Tepehua and Lhichiwin /itiwin/ in Pisaflores Tepehua (INALI
2006, Watters p.c.). According to Watters (1988), the word Tepehua is an exonym
from Nahuatl: tepe- ‘mountain’ and hua ‘dweller, owner’ (p. 4). The word
Huehuetla ‘place of the old people’ is also of Nahuatl origin, and there are two
possible etymologies: (i) huehue ‘old person’ and –tla ‘place of’ and (ii)
huehuetzotl ‘old god’ or ‘god of the town’ (Palacios 1993).2

"190First Person
A first person object—regardless of its number—is indicated on the verb
with the first person object prefix kin- (~ ki-, kim-). Before the dental and alveolar
phonemes /t/, /t'/, /lh/, /ch/, and /ch’/, kin- occurs as [kin-] and [kin-], respectively,
and before the velar phoneme /k/, it occurs as [ki-], all of which are represented
orthographically by kin-, shown below in (214a). The allomorph kim- occurs
before /p/ and /p’/, shown below in (214b). Everywhere else, the first person
object morpheme may optionally appear as the reduced form ki- [ki-], (214c).

is used to co-index three different types of verbal argument: (i) a third person
plural subject (see above in section 3.1.1.1), (ii) a first person plural object with a
third person (singular or plural) subject, and (iii) a second person plural object
with a third person (singular or plural) subject. Thus, the verbal configuration
when the subject is third person and the object is first person plural is kin-ta-V-n
(1OBJ-3PL.SUB-V-2OBJ), as seen below in (216) and (217). These examples
demonstrate that the prefix ta- appears in this construction even if the third person
subject is singular, which leads to the ambiguity seen in (217a).

subject, the person marking is straight-forward. The first person singular object is
co-indexed by the prefix kin-, and the second person singular subject is indicated
by the glottalization of stops and affricates in the stem and (in the perfective
aspect) by the suffix –t’i, as seen in the example in (218).

stops and affricates that is used to indicate a second person subject does not occur
in this context (i.e., when both arguments are speech act participants and when
one or both of these SAP arguments is/are plural). This same combination of
prefixes is used in two other contexts: (i) a first person plural object with a second
person plural subject, and (ii) a first person singular object with a second person
plural subject. Just as the process of glottalization does not occur to indicate a
second person subject, nor does the second person plural subject suffix –t’it occur.","[215, 216, 217, 218]"

8.2.1 Focus Constructions
In HT, when a clausal constituent is focused, it occurs in the clause-initial
position. Several different constructions in HT may be analyzed as focus
constructions, including left-dislocation, topicalization, clefting, and answers to
questions. The first three constructions are addressed in this section, and focused
answers are discussed in sections 8.2.2 and 8.3 below.
In an HT left-dislocation construction, a focused noun or noun phrase
occurs in the clause initial position, and it is co-referential with a pronoun in the
matrix clause. Examples are shown in (742); here the clause-initial noun (phrase)
is enclosed in square brackets, and subscripted <i> indicates co-reference. In all
of the examples of left-dislocation that I have found, the clause-initial noun
(phrase) is co-referential with the subject of the clause. I have found no examples
in which it is co-referential with the object of the clause.",[574]
"2073.1.1.6 Double Object Marking
One of the differences among the various languages in the Totonacan
language family has to do with how the object arguments of a ditransitive verb are
co-indexed on the verb; some Totonacan languages exhibit symmetrical object
marking in which both objects are marked on the verb, while others exhibit
asymmetrical object marking in which only one object is marked on the verb, and
yet other languages exhibit some combination of symmetrical and asymmetrical
object marking (MacKay and Trechsler 2005, 2006). HT displays both
symmetrical and asymmetrical object marking, which I describe below.
HT double object marking can be modeled using the person hierarchy that
was introduced above in example (213) of Section 3.1.1.3, and which is repeated
below in (247).
(247) Person Hierarchy and Object Marking
1st person & 2nd person >> 3rd person plural
symmetricalsymmetrical
asymmetricalIn this hierarchy, the speech act participants (SAPs)—that is, first and second
persons—are equal to each other, and they outrank all third person object
arguments. A plural third person object outranks a singular third person object by
virtue of the fact that a singular third person object is never overtly marked on the
verb. When both objects are SAPs, object marking is symmetrical. When both
objects are third person plural, object marking is also symmetrical. However,208when a SAP object co-occurs with a third person plural object, the object marking
on the verb is asymmetrical. Specific examples follow.
The examples in (248) show that when both objects are speech act
participants, the object marking is symmetrical: both first and second person
object affixes appear on the verb. Note that the verb in (248a) is exactly the same
as the verb in (248b) and that the example sentences are ambiguous with respect
to the thematic roles of the objects: either object may be the patient and either
object may be the benefactive/recipient argument.

‘Your mother always handed me over to you.’[Q3I]The examples in (249) and (250) show that when one of the objects is a
SAP and the other is a plural third person, object marking is asymmetrical: only
the SAP is marked on the verb, regardless of its thematic role. In both (249a) and
(250a), the SAP is the recipient or benefactive argument (the indirect object),209which is indicated by the valence-increasing dative suffix –ni (which is
underlined in both examples). In both (249b) and (250b), the SAP is the patient
argument (the direct object) as evidenced by the lack of the dative suffix -ni on
either of these two verbs. Also in each of these two examples, there is an overt
plural third person nominal that co-references the benefactive argument (the
indirect object); however this argument is not registered on the verb.

verb by the prefix lak-, while in (251b), the plural third person benefactive
argument is co-indexed on the verb by the prefix 7a-, which is also used to
indicate an understood plural object on a detransitivized verb (see Section

2.7.2.3 [i-]-Epenthesis
A third type of epenthesis—[i-]-epenthesis—occurs when the addition of

only with the addition of the following prefixes: (i) the first person subject prefix
k- that occurs on verb stems, (ii) the past tense prefix x- that occurs on verb stems,
and (iii) the third person possessor prefix x- that occurs on noun stems.
The [i-]-epenthesis rule is formulated below in (165), and examples
appear in (166), (167), and (168). The addition of word-initial [i-] allows the
following prefix to act as a syllable coda rather than as a syllable onset. Please see

when it occurs inter-vocalically (26a), syllable (or word) initially (26b), or as the
second element of a syllable (or word) initial consonant cluster, in which the first
member is a fricative (26c).

‘They could not take out many things.’[T0018: 005]Unlike the passive construction in English, the indefinite subject
construction in HT does not decrease the valency of the verb; the object retains its
object status, and the subject retains its subject status. However, this construction
does serve to foreground the object while backgrounding the subject, as seen
below in the examples in (210). In (210a), the verb bears the indefinite subject
suffix, and the clause has an overt object (juu xaniin lapanák ‘the dead people’),
as well as an overt subject (juu lapanák ‘the people’). Similarly, in (210b), the
verb bears the indefinite subject suffix, and the clause has an overt subject (juu
7anu7 lapanak ‘that person’), an overt direct object (juu lhiich'alhkat ‘a job’), and
an indirect object (‘me’) that is co-referenced on the verb by first person subject
inflection, which is underlined in the example.

Before discussing HT relative clauses, I want to first explain the notational
conventions that I use in the examples in this section. The external head of the
relative clause is underlined, the relativizer appears in bold type, and the relative
clause is enclosed in square brackets. Note that in HT there is no overt relativized
noun or pronoun within the relative clause that is co-referential with the external
head noun. In order to avoid confusion, I model this absent relativized element
using a zero. In a post-nominal relative clause, the zero is co-indexed with the
external head of the relative clause. The schematic shown in (808) of a relative
clause in English demonstrates these notational conventions.
(808) The airplane i [that ∅i landed in New York]RC was an Airbus A380.
headrelativizerNPRELrelative clauseHT has both post-nominal and headless relative clauses. The post-nominal
relative clause always follows the noun that it modifies, as seen below in (809a).
The headless relative clause does not modify a nominal, but itself acts as a verbal
complement, as seen below in (809b); it may occur either clause-initially or
clause-finally. A relative clause is usually introduced by the relativizer juu,216 but
it may also be introduced by the locative relative pronoun juntaa ‘where’ or its
truncated form taa.","[613, 614]"

After my first summer of field work on HT, and before returning to the
field the following summer, I measured a small sample of HT vowels in a
phonetics laboratory in order to determine the acoustics of the HT vowel space.20
The data used for this study were taken from several tape recordings that I made
during the summer 1999. The speaker on all tapes is don Nicolás, who was 44
years old at the time. Each tape-recording was made in a cinder block room using
a Sony TCM-EV cassette recorder. At the time that I made these recordings, I did
not plan to use them for acoustic analysis; therefore, I made no attempt either to
elicit the words in a frame or carrier sentence or to control the phonetic
environment around the vowels. Furthermore, there is a good deal of background
noise on the recordings.","[79, 80, 81]"
"16I worked primarily with don Nicolás, and my first task was to teach him to
read and write my HT practical orthography. We spent much of the nine months
that I was there recording narratives and conversations with various community
members, then transcribing them and translating them into Spanish.
In a rural village, the mornings are the busiest time of the day for the
town’s people, who rise early to begin their daily tasks. The men go off to the
fields to work, while the women see their children off to school and hurry to get
some of the never-ending housework done before the children come home again
in the early afternoon. Thus, the mornings were never a good time for me to
search out consultants because no one—except don Nicolás—had time to work
with me.
Thus, don Nicolás and I spent our mornings transcribing and translating
texts. The first step in this process involved transcribing an entire HT text. Next
don Nicolás translated the HT text loosely into Spanish. Finally, we completed a
word-for-word translation together; this allowed me to analyze the words as we
worked and to conduct impromptu grammatical and semantic tests when I
encountered new forms.
In the early afternoons, there was a period of about two hours that fell
after most of the chores were done but before the children came home from
school. During these two hours, the whole town was very peaceful, and the adults
were resting. This was the best time of the day for me to go visiting other people
in the community in search of HT consultants. Thus, most afternoons, don17Nicolás and I would venture out into the town to record texts and word lists with
various community members.
In addition to transcribing and translating texts with don Nicolás, I also
conducted straight lexical and grammatical elicitation with him, often involving
one to three additional HT speakers in the sessions. I organized the grammatical
elicitation sessions based on topics suggested in Payne (1997) and issues that
came up during text transcription and translation.
Even though I worked with 50 different HT-speakers during the course of
my fieldwork, the bulk of the grammatical judgments on which this grammar are
based belong to don Nicolás; thus, this dissertation could be considered to be a
descriptive grammar of his idiolect, to some extent.
I used a Sony MZ-R30 portable mini-disk recorder and a Sony DCRTRV11 Digital Handycam to record digital video onto mini-DVs. I also used a
Marantz PMD222 Portable Cassette Recorder to copy and play back audio data,
and a dictophone transcription machine and foot pedal to transcribe the recorded
discourse. I used the SIL computer program Shoebox 1.0 (the DOS version that
was still used by the PDLMA) to database the collected data and to interlinearize
the texts, and I used Speech Analyzer (version unknown) to make spectrograms in
the field.
In addition to audio-recording narratives, texts, and conversation, I video
recorded the events of several of the town’s major holidays, including Candlemas
(Candelaria) and Mardi Gras (Carnaval). The data from my time in Huehuetla
include 53 transcribed and translated texts that vary in length from one to sixty18minutes and that fill over 800 notebook pages; seven untranscribed narrative
recordings; approximately 700 pages of notes from grammatical and lexical
elicitation sessions; 16 hours of audio recordings; and 12 hours of video
recordings.
In the summer of 2005, I returned to Catemaco to complete my third and
final summer for the PDLMA. This time, because of family obligations at home
in Texas, I spent only five weeks working on the project. Once again, don Nicolás
was my principal consultant. During this time, I finished direct elicitation of the
Bouquiaux Questionnaire. I tested all of the ethnobotanical and ethnozoological
terms in the database, then don Nicolás sorted them all into taxonomies. We went
through Melissa Bowerman’s Topological Picture Series (no date), which
produced positional verbs, relational nouns, and prepositional phrases. I elicited
color terms using a color chart (Hoogshagen and Hoogshagen 1993), and I
elicited smells using those listed in Enríquez (2004) for Papantla Totonac. We
used a large toolbox full of tools typically found in Mexican farming communities
to generate words for all of the various tools. I used the existing ethnozoological
terms in the database to elicit words for animal cries, noises, and movements. We
did not record any texts at all that summer, nor did we do any transcription or
translation. This was the first field summer that I did not work with notebooks. To
save time, I entered most of the data directly into the database, resorting to file
slips only occasionally.
In all I spent 14 months conducting field work on Huehuetla Tepehua. I
have so much data in notebooks, on file slips, on mini-(audio)-disks, on video,19even on random scraps of paper, that I feel like I will never have enough time to
analyze it all. After I returned from the field in 2001, it took me three years to
organize the small portion of the data that I have used to write this grammar.4
Even though I felt compelled to continue adding to the dictionary and
interlinearizing texts, I reached a point when I had to stop organizing and start
analyzing and writing. There are many gaps in the analyzed data presented here,
but I am sure that answers to the questions left by these gaps can be found
somewhere in the volumes that I have collected, if only I knew where to look.
Cecil Brown recently told me that it is only after the Ph.D. is done that the real
work begins. I know that I have my work cut out for me for years to come.
1.3 HUEHUETLA TEPEHUA AND THE TOTONACAN LANGUAGE FAMILY
Huehuetla Tepehua is a member of the Tepehua branch of the Totonacan
language family, which has only two branches, Tepehua and Totonac (see Figures
1 and 2 below). The Totonacan languages are spoken in the Mexican states of
Veracruz, Puebla, and Hidalgo, and the Totonac and Tepehua branches are
mutually unintelligible (MacKay 1999). Because so little documentation exists for
the Totonacan languages, it has not been possible to determine if this language
family is a linguistic isolate or if it is related to Mayan and Mixe-Zoquean, as
suggested by Greenberg (1987) and McQuown (1940, 1942). However, Kaufman
(2003) argued that the lexical cognates that exist between Totonacan and MixeZoquean are the result of contact rather than genetics.","[41, 42, 43, 44, 45]"

examples in (254), I provided the HT clause, and my consultant approved the

the patient argument milhpaati ‘song(s)’ on the transitive verb. In (254b) the verb
is made ditransitive by the addition of the comitative prefix t'aa-, and the new
argument Weensis ‘Lawrence’ is singular; the gloss of the patient argument is still
‘songs’, and this argument is still co-indexed on the verb by the prefix lak-. In
(254c), the comitative argument is the third person plural pronoun yu7unch, and
the gloss of the patient argument milhpaati is now the singular argument ‘music’,
indicating that it is no longer the argument which is co-indexed by lak-; instead
the plural comitative argument is co-indexed by lak-.

[Q3I]3.1.1.7 Speech Act Participant Marking
The reciprocal marker laa-80 is used in a non-reciprocal way when both
the subject and the object of the verb are first or second person and either or both
arguments are plural, as seen below in (255). In these instances, the prefix laaindicates that both participants are speech act participants and that one or both
is/are plural; it does not indicate mutual, reciprocal action. In (255a), a first person
subject is acting on a second person object, and in (255b), a second person subject
is acting on a first person object. The only difference in the two conjugations is in
the first prefix, which is k- if the subject is first person—as in (255a)—and ki(n)if the object is first person—as in (255b).
