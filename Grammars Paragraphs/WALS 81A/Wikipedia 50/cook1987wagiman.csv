"A further difficulty for the predictive status of word order
typology is that it relies heavily on the presence of adpositions (prepositions or postpositions), particularly in
regard to the order of NP constituents. An entirely affixing language such as Wagiman is thus irrelevant to many
generalizations concerning sentence order (Comrie 1981:85).
The generalizations made of NP order above fall into this
category, and can have no predictive value within the typology for the rest of the language.
The constituent 'Vf is also somewhat problematic in Wagiman,
where what can be considered the 'verb' can be expressed by
more than one item; the predicate of a clause can comprise a
finite verb and one or two participles which can have their
own object arguments and ordering possibilities (cf. 9.2.1).
Nevertheless, an examination of the texts in the Appendix
reveals that some, albeit weak, generalizations about constituent order are possible.
The texts were chosen as the
corpus for this analysis because of their relative.independence from English influence on order. They display a strong
freedom of constituent order, and 59 different sentence
(order) types occur. Constituents counted were: A (Agent),0 (Object), Si (Intransitive subject), V (Verb), P (Parti-ciple), Obl (Oblique nominal) Inst (Instrumental) and X (any
other item, such as adverbs, locatives or directionals).
Of 256 sentences which contained a finite verb, exactly half
(128) contained one or more core case NPs (Oblique objects
or complements of intransitive verbs are also counted in
this group), and the remainder (again 128) occurred with
core roles represented only in the finite verb prefix; these
sentences generally also contained at least one other item
as well.
Remarkably, only 6 sentences actually contained
both A and 0, while 6 also contained Si and Obl (an Oblique
object complement of some sort) or Si and an Absolutive
complement.
Despite the potential freedom of order for participles relative to verbs, the texts revealed a tendency for them to
occur directly before the finite verb (56 examples), although they also occurred following it (18 examples), with
three examples recorded where some other item occurred betThe most
ween V and P (XVSiPX, XVXP and XVPXPX order).
common PV order was, in fact, PV, while the most common VP
order was XVP. The data in Figure 11-3 summarizes the
recorded orders (constituents in parentheses, such as (OP),
indicate that the 0 is an argument of the Participle, not
the finite verb or the predicate as a whole).
Because of the consistent link between V and P, their occurrence together was counted as a single 'V' for the purposes
of order relative to other constituents, simplifying the
variety of clause order types significantly.
In the 12 sentences with two nominal participants (including
free pronouns), no strong order tendencies were found. Only
one of the 12 sentences also contained any other material
apart from the 'V' and the core NPs. 'SiXVO1 in Figure 11-4
represents a copula construction with an Absolutive complement described as '0' for ordering purposes.","[312, 313]"

However, in transitive verbs where new patients are acted
upon, they need specification with a free nominal. The
preponderance of overt object norninals in the texts, as
opposed to agents or subjects is a function of this process.
The general tendency of focussed material to occur at the
beginning of the clause (Mallinson and Blake 1981:152) can
also produce an overt free nominal in an early position in a
clause, where it would not necessarily be expected on other
grounds; the 'new-before-old' principle is thus not absolute, and can be countered by relative focus.

followed by an Oblique object can be generally discounted as
V O(b1) sentences because the construction is a fixed expression used to introduce and close direct quotations (see
particularly text LMD 2 .in Appendix 1 and section 11.4.3
below).
Si also tended to precede, rather than follow V
(again in a ratio of approximately 3 to I), as described in

the constituent orders recorded in clauses containing at
least one NP:(i)
the most favoured free nominal in two-place
clauses was 0;
(ii)
when 0 occured as the only free NP, it tended
to precede V;
(iii)
in intransitive clauses with a free NP subject, Si tended to precede V;
(iv)
V was the most common sentence-final constituent, and 0 was the most common initial item;(v)
the few clauses containing two core NPs showed
no clearly favoured orders.i,IIThe only fact exhibited by these generalizations is that V .
tended to follow any overt nominal that occurred; little
else can be stated with certainty. A 'basic order' of the
constituents Si, A, 0 and V cannot be determined from such
data, both because of the lack of any favoured order, but
also because of the lack of clauses containing two core NPs.
Wagiman is thus a language for which sentence constituent
typology is largely irrelevant, because of its lack of a
basic word order. In conclusion, 'word order1 (the order of
major constituents) in Wagiman must be described as 'free',
but in which the occurrence and order of elements is a function of strong pragmatic constraints.
11.3Simple sentences (verbless equational
constructions)Simple sentences are those which contain only one predicate
and are not logically linked to any other clause. Three
types can be defined: (i) finit.e verb clauses; (ii) participle imperative clauses; and (iii) verbless equational
clauses. Finite clauses with participles are considered to
be internally 'complex1; their morphology, function and
semantics were described in Chapter 9, and their syntax is
treated below in 11.5.","[315, 316, 317]"
"- -The Plural suffixes -buga and -godin and the Pair suffixes
-gudyu and - g i n are also clitics within this definition,
although they are not restricted to a host dominated by
'NP': they can also occur on a host dominated by the node
Verb (see 6.3 above).
The INITIAL/FINAL parameter is not
relevant to their attachment to verbs because the 'V' node
contains only one element (the finite verb complex).
Although they usually occur inside the scope of case marking
clitics, their classification as FINAL, AFTER, and ENCLITIC
remains unaffected; where they occur after a host element
but before another clitic, they are still enclitic to the
host (ie. AFTER and ENCLITIC). Case marking clitics following number clitics are also unaffected, and are still enclitic to the final element of the NP (cf. 6-110, in which
the order -NUMBER-CASE occurs for the suffixes).
The relative ordering of case and non-case clitics is due to
the effects of semantic scope and the particular syntactic
function of each (discussed in 6.1). The Specific referent
suffix -di is often an exception, however, and usually occurs on the non-final demonstrative modifier of an NP (cf.
-di would thus need to be characterized in most
examples as INITIAL, AFTER and ENCLITIC because of the typical occurrence of demonstratives before their head, forma'an-di

3sg:IPFV-possess-PRESga'an-di

Nevertheless, the few recorded examples where -di occurs on
a non-initial or NP-final demonstrative modifier indicate
that the restriction is not syntactic:

that-SPEC[DJM 6841'[The goats belong to] that particular woman.'
On these grounds it is clear that -di cannot be characterized as consistently INITIAL. A more appropriate analysis
would be to classify it as a clitic which has a preferred
lexical host within the MP, and the parameter 'Dominance'
(INITIAL/FINAL) is not one relevant to its use. In single
nominal NPs, such as unmodified pronouns, it is still clearly classifiable as AFTER and ENCLITIC, while again the parameter INITIALIFINAL is not applicable.
1.2!
)I
LiIMajor consituent orderApart from the order of NP constituents described in 11.1.1
above, the order of various syntactic elements, primarily
the major constituents S (Subject), 0 (Object) and V (Verb),
has become a major basis for the typology of languages
(Greenberg 1963, Comrie 1981, Mallinson and Blake 1981).
Wagiman has relatively great freedom of constituent order at
the referential level, and is not easily amenable to a description involving the order of S, V and 0 for a number of
reasons.
In a morphologically ergative language, the 'subject' is
usually expressed by two formally different elements: an
intransitive subject (Si) and a transitive agent (A).
In
Wagiman, Si and A are formally and morphologically distinguished, and following Mallinson and Blake (1981:123), S is
split here into Si and A for the purposes of determining the
order of elements. 0 is distinguished from Si, despite
formal similarity (both are unmarked Absolutive case), onfunctional grounds (see 6.2.1 and 6.2.2. ). The basic constituents S, V, and 0 have to be expanded to Sip A, v and 0
in any attempt to define basic order.","[309, 310, 311, 312]"
"nominals ('ADJ') which are norninals, including quantifiers,
used in an attributive function; and possessive pronouns
('GEN').
NP constituent order can thus be described in
terms of the order of modifiers relative to N.
The majority of NPs comprise only two elements. The following data is taken from material recorded from Douglas Jack
Milguyarri, Lulu Martin Dalpalngali, George Huddleston Yalkpayarri, and also from the texts in Appendix 1. The nonnarrative text material has been selected as far as possible
from those sessions where speakers' utterances were not explicit translations of English prompt sentences. The orders
N ADJ, N GEN and DEM N were the most common, although other
orders (ADJ N, GEN N and DEM N) also occurred. The raw
scores are as follows:
Figure 11-1NP constituent orderN ADJ64N DEM53N GEN42159ADJ N14DEMN215GEN N23252In most unelicited speech, the favoured order is N ADJ, N
GEN and DEM N. Elicited translations or examples produced
from an English prompt with ADJ N order in an NP tended to
produce Wagiman NPs with the same order. Variation in NP
constituent order is clearly possible, due perhaps to an
originally flexible order which was modified for discourse
or contextual purposes, or to the influence of English on
what was originally a strict Head-Modifier order.
Despite the permitted flexibility, there is a distinct synchronic tendency for attributive norninals and possessive
pronouns to follow their head, and an overwhelming tendency
for demonstratives to precede it. The correlation of a
dominant N GEN order with N ADJ order is harmonic from a
universal point of view, where if a language has N GEN orderthen it will usually have N ADJ order (Greenberg 1963:79). 1
Similarly, the occurrence of dominant DEM N order is not
unexpected despite a general typological correlation between
demonstrative order and adjective order, because of a further marked tendency of N ADJ languages to have DEM N order
(op. cit.:86).
Interference from English, however, still cannot be ruled
out as the source of the DEM N order particularly. The
function of the medial demonstrative ga'an 'that, there' as
a definite article, and its occurrence before a head nominal, were discussed in 5.4.1.2 as possibly reflecting a borrowing from English. The innovative use of ga'an in such a
way could have caused a general shift of the other demonstratives to the same order position. None of the speakers
whose language was recorded was brought up outside the influence of English, and whether the original situation was as
currently indicated cannot now be determined.
In the same corpus, 42 examples of NPs comprising three
nominals were recorded. Using the same four classifications
(N, ADJ, DEM, GEN) , 24 order types are possible if no more
than one occurrence of each nominal type occurs in any NP;
only 12 actually occurred, however. These are given in
Figure 11-2.
Again, DEM-initial orders are most common, of which exactly
half (14) were DEM N ADJ order, while GEN-initial orders did
not occur at all. Other generalizations are not possible
with such a small number of examples.","[305, 306, 307]"

which represent Si, A and 0 in the verb or by clitics, it is
extremely rare for Wagiman sentences to contain free nominal
expressions of both A and 0, or even Si, providing little
evidence for statements about 'basic' order (op. cit.:129).",[312]

'syntax' in Wagiman. Topics discussed are of language-specific as well as typological interest: NP structure, major
constituent order, non-finite equational clauses, finite
clause adjunction, the syntax. of participle constructions,
Oblique contrastive constructions, reduplication and a syntactic focus clitic.
11.1Noun Phrase structureThe constituent 'Noun Phrase' (NP) can be justified on the
basis that case marking suffixes normally occur on the final
element only of contiguous nominal members of an NP. Discontinuous NPs, where members are separated from each other
by some other lexical category, do not occur. Nominals
separated by other items in a clause are thus always members
of different NPs, although not all examples of contiguous
nominals need necessarily be members of the same NP. However, morphologically unmarked nominals having different NP
membership are rare (see 11.2 below), and are in any case
distinguished through context and intonation.
The following sections describe NP constituent order and
case marking respectively.
11.1.1NP constituent orderAn NP typically consists of two, and occasionally three,
nominals, one of which (the 'head') is semantically modified
by the other(s)
The relative order of the head and modifiers of NPs is not grammatically fixed, although some generalizations are possible.
Following Greenberg's (1963)
approach to the typology of language on the basis of the
order of sentence elements, modifiers of an NP head nominal
( N ) are categorized here into various classes: demonstratives (IDEM'), including all the deictics; adjectival.","[302, 303, 304, 305]"
"1For SOV languages only, however. Problems arise for
Wagiman in such a typology because it does not have postpositions or normal SOV order which is harmonic with it. Major
constituent order is discussed below in 11.2.",[307]

12Clearly, a major problem in determining any order is that
usually either A or 0 only, but not both, occurred in transitive clauses as a free nominal, and in clauses that take an
oblique complement often the Oblique only occurred. In the
texts the overwhelming choice for the single overt free
nominal was 0 (43 transitive examples, plus 41 other examples of the verb ya'an 'to say, tell' followed by an Oblique
pronoun), while A occurred overtly only in 4 sentences. In
intransitive clauses, an overt S occurred on 33 occasions:
Figux-e 11-5Single NP clausesNP as Obl41Such a pattern is indicative of two discourse processes in
action. The first is that in narrative discourse, once a
topic is established it is usually referred to only by pronominal reference in the prefix, and' no further overt nominal reference is made to it. Furthermore, the grammatical
role of the topic is not important in such reference because
the general ordering principle of 'topic-to-the-left' (Mallinson and Blake 1981.:151) does not affect the position of
the prefix, allowing any grammatical role to be topic without creating ordering conflict. In this way, the topic
marked in the prefix without any nominal referent is 'old'
or previously given information. The second process is one
where new information is introduced by an overt nominal and
occurs earlier in the clause than other material, thus following a principle of 'new-before-old'.
In a narrative in the first person, the agent or subject is
usually established relatively early, and is then tracked
through the discourse by reference in the prefix. Often it
is not even referred to initially by an overt pronoun.","[313, 314, 315]"

7.4Prefix formsThis section is concerned only with the prefix forms themselves. 'Bound pronouns' in Australian languages are usually treated as having developed from free pronouns (cf. Heath
1976:177, Dixon 1980:363, Blake ms. chapter 6), implying
that at some earlier stage of a language, free form pronouns
became frozen in their position and order before a verb (for
prefixes), and subsequently became fixed to the verb morphologically and phonologically through a re-analysis of their
status.

with the free Base pronouns (ignoring for the moment different mood and aspect forms) suggests correspondences between
free forms and boulid forms. Dixon's (1980:334-46) 'proto-Fixing of word order is not necessary to the account,
however.
Dixon (1980:368) argues that an alternation between free pronouns and reduced forms, which are attached to
the verb- or sentence-initial item, can be proposed as a
likely route to the develpoment of bound pronouns, rather
than there necessarily having to be an 'intermediate stage'
of fixed word order.","[214, 215]"
"Introduction
0.1Linguistic summaryWagiman is spoken in the 'Top Endf area of the Northern
Territory of Australia, originally approximately 200 km
south of Darwin. It is a member of the 'Non-Pama-Nyungan'
group of languages (following Wurm's (1972) classification)
which are spoken over all of the Top End and the Kimberley
region of Western Australia, apart from the small PamaNyungan enclave of 'Yolngul languages in the north-eastern
corner of Arnhem Land (Dixon 1980:257).
Portmanteau prefixes on verbs have mood, aspect and pronominal function, while optional suffixes occur to express
various aspect and tense values (see Chapter 7).
Free pronouns distinguish singular, dual and plural for
first person, but singular and non-singular only for second
and third person (see Chapter 5), although dual number can
be marked by suffix.
Core case marking for all nominals is morphologically ergative, although the Ergative suffix is not obligatory, while
the prefix system is 'neutral' in respect of case frame (see
Blake 1975:6).
There are no nominal class markers as in
other languages spoken nearby (Kunwinjku (Carrol 1976),
Waray (Harvey 1986) Ngalakan (Merlan 1983)), but nominal
suffixes express a variety of grammatical relations.
In
general terms the language has a large amount of inflectional morphology, but, unusual for Australian languages, no
derivational morphology whereby word class membership can be
changed or verb transitivity altered (cf. Dixon 1980:271,
278).
Major constituent order is generally free, although some
order tendencies within constituents can be determined (see
sections 11.1 and 11.2).","[18, 19]"
"A minor neutralization which also occurs is that between 2pl
Ipfv and 3sg Pot gu-. This would presumably be a late neutralization, given that the Potential series can be argued as203having developed after the Imperfective. It is not as critical in referential terms as the lpl/2sg and 2pl/lsg neutralization because of different mood and aspect reference
for the forms, which would tend to lead to disambiguation.
The possibility of suffixing further tense or aspect morphemes to verbs marked with gu- would also disambiguate: the
occurrence of an Immediate future suffix on the verb indicates 3sg Potential reference for example, while the Nonpast habitual suffix would indicate 2pl Imperfective.
7,4,2Transitive prefix form a n a l y s i sSynchronically, the transitive prefix forms are not open to
a full internal analysis; a brief examination of the neutralized forms illustrated some of the difficulties involved.
Nevertheless, because transitive prefixes mark for two nomi n a l ~ ,it would be expected that they reflect original
agentlobject (or subject/object) combinations which would
have comprised a sequence of analysable pronominal forms.
In most cases, however, only one recognizable pronoun form
remains in the prefix, and many must now be considered portmanteau morphemes. Despite the problems, some analysis can
still be made.
Generally, the initial CV- sequence is synchronically recognizable from the free pronouns, and corresponds to the nominal in the clause which is highest on a person and number
hierarchy. The form -ba is also a clear third person plural
marker for both agent and object functions, but is possibly
a recent addition to the system. Furthermore, some forms
still contain what can be analysed as vestigial remains of
earlier, more transparent, combinations of subject/object
forms, as well as the initial CV- pronominal form.
Person and number hierarchies are common for bound pronouns
in Australian (and other) languages (cf. Heath 1976, Silverstein 1976, Blake 1977).
These hierarchies usually place
pronouns in the approximate order: 1st person > 2nd person
> 3rd person, and are also found in languages nearby to
%.","[221, 222]"
"where Wagiman was traditionally spoken.
In Rembarnga the
patient always precedes the agent in transitive prefixes
(Blake 1977:27).
The same is also the case for Kunwinjku,
but subject to certain other hierarchical constraints ('Gunwinggu' in Blake 1977:33). The ordering in Wagiman prefixes
is based on a person/number hierarchy alone, although the
neutralizations in the system make an exact description of
the hierarchy dificult to formulate.
If ga- in all forms is taken consistently to reflect Isg,
then it can be seen that, regardless of its grammatical
function in the clause, it always occurs first in prefixes.
Thus, the initial hierarchical relationship of lsg > (2sg,
2p1, 3pl) can be proposed, where lsg is higher than all of
the others as a group. The relative positions of lpl and
2sg cannot be determined because of the neutralization of
this contrast in general. However, the ordering of lpl >
3pl can be seen in giba-, in which the recognizable 3pl
morpheme occurs after lpl gi-.
The relative positions of
2sg and 3sg are also obscured because the -u in gundyu- does
not seem to reflect 2sg qi-. The origin of -u- in gu- here
is essentially unknown, although assimilation of i
(in a
putative 2sg *qi-) to -a- in -dyu- is not impossible.
The ranking of 2pl > 3sg can be determined from guggu-,
where pa- represents second person plural.
Because it is
not possible to determine the position of the so-called
' zero morpheme' for 3sg objects (for example, 2sg/3sg could
be 9+gi- or qi+g-), then 3sg cannot be strictly ordered
relative to other persons when it is a patient .6 Given that
lpl and 2pl can be seen to precede it when it is an agent,6Tryon (1971:9), however, does attempt to order a 3sg
'zero morpheme' before the overt prefix form gin-, glossed
by him as 'us two', so that the '3sg acting on ldu' prefix
is analysed as @-gin 'he-us two'. Such an analysis is
observationally inadequate, and confuses s theoretical construct with morphological reality; no evidence of any order
can be provided when one of the elements is consistently
null.","[222, 223]"
"Finite clause participle constructions are also characterized by several structural and semantic generalizations
concerning the various relationships that hold between finite verb and participle(s):
the participle in single participle finite
clause constructions usually (but not necessarily always)
directly precedes the finite verb in the clause (cf. 11.2);
(i)(ii)
no more than two participles have been recorded in any one finite clause; where two do occur, their
order relative to other major clausal constituents and each
other is less fixed than in single participle constructions;
(iii)
participles need not agree formally with each
other or the finite verb in respect of aspect marking, but
the value of any such marking on any one item always applies
to the clause as a whole, and not only to the relevant individual items;
(iv)
participles and finite verbs combine to form
simultaneous, compound meanings, and always complement each
other's meaning; incongruous semantic or pragmatic combinations do not occur; andthe co-occurrence of participles and finite
verbs is relatively unrestricted, and participles can occur
with other particioles and different finite verbs within the
broad limits stated in (iv) above.
The description of participles in the following sections is
according to their structural and semantic features. Particular examples sometimes occur more than once in different
places, mainly because they can exhibit more than one relevant feature. Semantic features of participles, particularly in finite clauses, often cut across structural features,
and structure and meaning do not always necessarily fully
correspond: although two particular sentences might apparently involve the same type of construction, quite different
meanings can result due to the individual lexical meanings
of the participles. The following section on the structure
of finite participle clauses provides typical examples of
their semantic nature which is expanded upon in later sect-9-2.1 Structural nature of finite participle clausesA structural characteristic of serial verb constructions
generally is a restriction on the nominal arguments associated with each verb in the sentence (Bradshaw 1982:28, in
Crowley 1984:3, Foley and Olson 1985:24).
This restriction
expresses itself as the requirement of identity of either
subject or object (agent or patient) betveen serialized
verbs.
A similar situation is to be found here, and the
participles and the finite verb in a clause normally have
one nominal argument in common. Within this view, finite
clause participle structures can be analysed similarly to
serial verb constructions as being either 'same-subject',
switch-subject ' (from Crowley. 1984, Foley and Olsen 1985)
or 'multiple object' constructions (from Durie 1982, in
Crowley 1984:4-5).
A further type in which the serialized
verb has no clausal argument, called 'ambient' constructions
(Crowley 1984:5) can also be identified.","[260, 261]"

Portmanteau prefixes on finite verbs usually carry two or
three pieces of information: person and number of the Subject or Agent and Object, and mood and/or aspect. The gloss
for prefixes has the information ordered in the following
way: either S:ASPECT or A/O:ASPECT. For example, a second
person singular intransitive Imperfective prefix would have
the gloss '2sg:IPFV'; a transitive Perfective prefix with a
third person singular agent and a second person plural
object would have the gloss '3sg/2pl:PFV1. In all transitive prefix glosses, the agent value precedes the patient,

10.3InterrogationInterrogation is of two functional types: polar interrogation, involving questions which can be answered with yaway
'yes' or wi3ya 'no', and non-polar interrogation, where
yaray or ri'ya are inaproppriate responses. Non-polar
interrogation involves so-called 'WH' questions, in which an
interrogative element of some type is required in the question, and which defines what is being questioned.
Polar interrogative sentences are syntactically identical
with declarative sentences, but differ in their intonation
contour; generally, major constituent order is unaffected.
Polar question intonation is not well understood, with few
examples occurring in the tape-recorded corpus.
Auditory
impressions of non-recorded examples indicate that suchquestions have a generally rising intonation over the final
syllables, in opposition to declaratives which have a generally falling final intonation contour. Alternations in word
order due to pragmatic factors can alter this dramatically,
with rising intonation occurring over single clause-initial
items if only they are being queried. However, this is not
an area that has been well recorded, and no concrete examples can be discussed here.","[300, 301]"
"In Chapter 11 areas of the syntax are examined:NP structure, constituent order, the syntax of participle constructions, and other syntactic topics.
Narrative texts are provided in the Appendix.",[17]
"Despite the productivity of the system generally, it is not
predictable for some cases, such as yorrtja + ge-na to mean
'to find' where ge-na usually means 'to put1, or for getja +
ge-na meaning 'to ask1. The latter example is understandable if getja is taken as meaning something like 'question',
but it is not a predictable combination: a finite verb such
as ya'an 'to say' would seem a priori to be just as likely,
but, in fact, does not occur.
11.6Oblique contrastive constructionsOblique contrastive constructions are not well represented
in the corpus numerically, and speakers did not respond well
to attempts to elicit them. However, the recorded occurrences are recognized by the presence of an Oblique (and
occasionally Possessive) pronoun, often marked with the
Specific referent suffix, as the complement of a copula
verb. A small number are functionally c~mparativeclauses,
while others merely contrast two propositions, one of which
can be seen as the converse of the other. The Specific
referent suffix also occurs in non-Oblique contrastive sentences, to mark the item being contrasted (see 6.3.4).
Most
of the following examples were unelicited.
The recorded comparative constructions comprise either one
or two clauses. Some examples provided by Lulu Martin Dalpalngali utilise yu-gin 'to be' and ya-qgi 'to go' as copula verbs, with an Oblique pronoun marking the object of
comparison (the 'standard'); George Allen Mundeng provided
one example (a translation elicitation) as a verbless equational clause.
Lulu Martin, on one occasion, gave two consecutive examples
which differ slightly. In one, the comparative nominal
occurs as the subject of the clause, with an Oblique pronominal complement expressing the object of comparison. A
second 'comparative' clause containing an antonym of the
quality being compared also follows the first to express
unambiguously exactly which referent has which quality. An
8interesting point in this clause is that the object of comparison is stated again as an Oblique pronoun complement of
the verb in either a type of 'impersonal' or 'Oblique subject' construction: because of ordering flexibility in
general, and the lack of nominal subject marking in particular, it is not possible to tell which NP is subject of the
verb yu- in the second clause of 11-56.

"'Furthermore, there appears to be a strong tendency for modifiers to follow, or more importantly, to be interpreted
only as following, their head in such NPs. This is not
necessarily always the case in less complex N P s , where
internal constituent order is less fixed. The possibility1Very litle conversational text material is recorded in
the language, and very few potentially ambiguous situations

The latter use is based on 'hearer
pivot'. It is possible to use ga'an if either of these
distance conditions holds, or for items outside the field of
view of both speaker and hearer when a definite reference is
intended. Such referents can be a relatively long way from
the speech act participants, for which the notion of pivot
is not relevant; gatan functions in these examples as a
definite article.
As a definite article, it always precedes the nominal it is
modifying, identical with the use of definite article 'the'
in English, and leading to the possible conclusion that this
particular use of ga1an, or at least the word order, is the
result of influence from English. A further problem is the
fact that, in any case, the order of modifying nominals
relative to an NP head is not fixed, with the result that
deictics can also follow the NP head. 3

argued in the following section that finite clause participle constructions are, in fact, the modern reflexes of
historical serial verb constructions which have evolved in a
different direction.
11.5.2Synchronic syntax of p a r t i c i p l e c o n s t r u c t i o n sIn 9.2 it was shown that participle constructions exhibit
many structural characteristics of serial verb constructions, but are nevertheless synchronically not such. However, evidence suggests that, historically, serialization of
finite verbs may have produced the class of participles as
modern frozen serialized elements.
Several points are of
relevance in such an analysis.
An important point is the variation between finite verb and
participle function for some items. Not all participles can
occur as finite verbs, but it would seem to be indicative of
a change in progress: either participles are moving towards
a finite verb function, or finite verbs are becoming partIf the latter is true, a corollary is that this
iciples.
process must be nearly completed.
Structurally, participles exhibit features typical of serial
verbs, including a limited ability to occur in switch-subject, multiple-object and ambient constructions. Semantically, serial verb constructions can be considered as an
interface between syntax and lexicon in that the meaning of
various types of construction is fixed lexically, despite
their productive nature in other ways (cf. Pawley 1980).
Ambient and switch-subject constructions fall into this
category: it is not possible to predict from the syntax whyM
Ithe object of the finite verb is the subject of the participle in a switch-subject construction (see examples 9-4 to
9-6), nor why ambient constructions do not have a more literal meaning, where the subject of the finite verb is also
the subject of the participle (see example 9-8).
Related to their structure, participles also vary in their
relative transitivity, and can have arguments different from
the finite verb, indicating the linking of separate predicates to form compound meanings as in serialization.
Several different sources can be proposed for modern participles within this approach:
(i)
Some participles were probably originally
monomorphemic finite verbs.
These would seem to have been
the participles in classes (iiia) and (iiib) in Figure 9-1
which are polysyllabic and end with a voiceless stop and the
vowel a .
Some of these participles can still occur as
finite verbs under particular circumstances (duduta(-yi) 'to
run' and guka(-yi) 'to sleep', for example). Others cannot,
although the synchronic triggers for the variation are not
known.
(ii)
Some participles may originally have been
adverbials or even other monomorphemic finite verbs compounded with another finite verb to form a polymorphemic verb
stem. The participles in classes (i) and (ii) in Figure 9-1
which are followed by a glottal stop and contain a final
syllable form of -ma, -na, or -ga are candidates here.
Significantly, -ma is homophonous with the finite verb ma-yi
'to get', a likely root for transitive compounding. In
Mangarayi, the form -ma currently occurs in compound constructions as an 'auxiliary' with other roots unable to occur
alone, and also as a main verb where it occurs with free
'particles' (Merlan 1982:129-30).
-na is also homophonous
with the Wagiman verb root na-ni 'to become', also a likely
inchoative compounding root.
Modern Wagiman participlesfollowed by -ga could be the result of either the compounding of another verb which has no modern form, or the result
of phonological changes over time, due perhaps to the preceding vowel or word-initial consonants. Only gaP1ma from
this group has been recorded as a finite verb.
(iii)
The participles in class (iv) which end in a
form homophonous with the finite verb yalan 'to say, to do'could also be the result of compounding with that verb, in
order to create a finite, perhaps causative, verb form (cf.
section 9.6). Some items in this class can also function as
modern finite verbs without -pavan, such as belka-yi 'to
roast, to cook'. Some others are also the result of synchronically transparent compounding (cf. guka 'sleep' and
gukayalan 'camp out').
Serial verb constructions would probably then have used
these derived or monomorphemic verbs by stringing them together in a sentence, linked by' common mood and tense
values, and perhaps other factors. Particular verbs could
also have retained their own arguments, giving rise to
multiple object and switch subject constructions.
It is
likely that one verb would have retained marking for tense,
mood and pronominal reference, and others in the series
would have remained unmarked.
For verb stems based on a
compound with -ma and ya1an, the unmarked root form of the
finite verb would have been used. However, it does not seem
unlikely that some constructions would have tended to become
lexicalized, and particular roots and stems would then have
tended to occur more often as either serial form verbs or
inflected finite verbs in relatively fixed constructions.
The current finite verbs all have meanings which fall in the
area of central vocabulary, such as 'come', 'go' 'ingest',
'spear', 'fall' and so on. A comparison with the verb roots
in the Pama-Nyungan languages Gurindji, Walmatjari, Jaru,
Warlmanpa and Warlpiri (usefully provided in Nash 1982 from
various sources) and also the Indo-European language Hindi
(also in Nash 1982, from data in Hook 1974:19-20, 119-20)'Zillustrates the point that in these languages, which all
have relatively few finite roots, approximately half the
meanings also occur coded as finite verbs in Wagiman. Verbs
with these meanings are likely to form the finite basis for
serial constructions because they describe commonly undertaken activities which can then be more explicitly described
in serialized form.
The comparisons are given in Figure
11-70

"1iThe bulk of the corpus used for the description is that
prov(.ded by Lulu Martin Dalpalngali and Douglas Jack Milguyarsi, mainly without translation prompts. The method used
here was to present the speaker with a topic word or sentence example, either in English or Wagiman, and to record
the ensuing discourse. This provided many good examples of
contextualized utterances and short texts of several clauses
in length. Neither of these two speakers tended to translate word for word, SO that the material gathered in this
manner is more reliable than that extracted from speakers
through translation prompts. One drawback, however, is that
it usually contains references to a small number of grammatical persons, because most sessions were with one speaker
only. Speakers generally also had a habit of perceiving a
discourse link between unconnected topic prompts, so that
many consecutively elicited utterances would be about the
same discourse topic, and would contain similarly-limited
numbers of verbs and participant references, despite attempts to extract other information.
One method of research found not to be particularly successful was providing speakers with sentences or forms in Wagiman in order to test their acceptability or grammaticality.
It was always difficult to be certain what was being agreed
to or rejected by individuals on these occasions, and there
were also cases where it was obvi'ous that speakers were
merely agreeing with what they thought I wanted to hear. In
others, it seemed that despite attempts to elicit grammaticality judgements, the speaker concentrated on pronunciation
only. For these reasons, unless a particular form or construction was actually produced, and not just agreed to in
response to a query, it has been considered to be of very
doubtful value.",[28]
"IHowever, such a classification is mechanical and coarse; it
fails to shed any light on the more subtle functional and
other, often semantic, differences that can be determined
within particular classes.
A broader description of word
classes would also be able to define sub-classes on linguistically relevant grounds. For example, the class of
Adverbs can be divided into sub-classes on the basis of
whether they code mood (negation, doubt) or other categories
(time, manner, position).
In this case the sub-classification is semantic.
Despite the use of functional and grammatical criteria for
the classification, names of word classes used here also
tend to reflect notional and traditional usage. Consequently, that class of words which includes those which express
actions, processes and states is called the class of
'verbs', although having this meaning is not a necessary
condition for inclusion in this class; it will be seen, for
example, that other syntactic and morphological criteria are
necessary to distinguish the class of verbs from the class
of 'participles'.
4.1NominalsNominals form an open class defined as those lexical items
which can carry case and other suffixes (described in Chapter 6 below), and which can occur in the central grammatical
roles of Agent, Patient and Subject. Nominals do not necessarily have to be able to occur with all nominal suffixes,
but the occurrence of one such'suffix on an item is sufficient to determine its status as a nominal. In notional
terms, most nominals describe the names of people, places
and real-world objects, and some would thus be called
'nouns' in traditional part-of-speech systems.",[105]
"Wagiman society was almost certainly based on distinctions
made through kin and class systems, as in most other Australian Aboriginal societies (Maddock 1982:81pp).
Kin systems are based on egocentric classifications, in which address and reference terms vary with point of view; an individual can stand in different kin relations to different
people. Data on Wagiman kinship terms and the original
system is particularly sparse. I have recorded a number of
Wagiman kinship terms, but the system is no longer used or
well known; even old speakers provided confusing and contradictory information in this area, and I have been unable to
record any reliable material in order to study the system in
detail.
Class terms are invariable, and are used to 'order persons'
(Maddock 1982:90).
Wagiman society had eight classes in an
indirectly matrilineal 'subsection' system, for which clear
material has been recorded. Each individual in such a system was a member of one class only for their entire life;
the class membership
of the mother determined the class
>membership of offspring, as well as providing information on
preferred marriage partners and behavioural rules (Maddock
1982~92-4).
Subsection systems originated relatively recently in the
'Top End1 area (McConvell 1985, Chase and Meehan 1983:16),
and the terms have a uniform shape across large distances
and in different languages.
Wagiman people are still able to provide subsection terms,
which they call gumit (literally 'skin'), from their traditional culture, but are often unsure about the correct
marriage and other relationships that go with them. Older
people seem more aware of the function and working of the
system than younger people, and George Huddleston Yalkpayarri, Don Liddy Balambal and Dolly Huddleston Wudyinma
provided the information in this section.
There are male and female ('brother' and 'sister') terms for
..eachsubsection, making 16 terms in all.
The male terms
commence with dy- and the female terms with na-. A lamina1
lateral, otherwise not a phoneme of the la-nguage,occurs in
the terms nalyarri and dyalyarri. All 16 terms, preferred
mariage partner and the subsection of offspring are given in
Figure 0-1, in the notation proposed by Barnes (n .d. , cited
in Maddock 1982:86-7).

necessary.","[29, 30]"

5.3.5Possessive functionThe Oblique pronouns contrast subtly with the Possessive
pronouns. Unlike the Possessive pronouns themselves, which
express possession directly, the Oblique pronouns imply a
more indirect possessive relation, usually translated into
English with the phrase 'of mine', 'of yours' etc. They are
also used to express the idea of 'belonging to', inasmuch as
this means 'associated with'.
Like the Possessive pronouns the Obliq'xe pronouns can function as the genitive head of an NP, or as s direct pronominal
possessive argument of a predicate; they are effectively
identical in syntactic function with the Possessive pronouns. There remains, however, the slight difference in
meaning.
The following examples of the Oblique pronouns are contrasted directly with similar examples with Possessive pronouns,
in order to illustrate the semantic differences involved:5-19qi-bu-nigatan2sg:PFV-hit-PASTthatlamarra

5e3e6Direct o b j e c t f u n c t i o nThe direct object use of the Oblique pronouns is in apparent
contrast with other examples given above, where only an
indirect link holds -between the oblique argument and the
predicate.
In the following examples, it seems that the
Oblique pronouns might be in free variation with Absolutive
Base pronouns in expressing the direct object (affected
patient) of a transitive verb. The variation, moreover, is
not understood in relation to the functions associated with
the Oblique pronouns generally.","[124, 125, 126]"
"Ii
I)A contrast between nominal suffix types in Wagiman along
different grounds can be proposed, however, on the basis of
'case' and non-case' functions.
'Case' suffixes are those
which relate an NP syntactically to a verb or predicate, and
include such relations as Agent of a transitive clause, Goal
2
of motion, Purpose of the predicate action, and so forth.
'Non-case' suffixes code relations that hold for nominals
within and over an NP. This would include relations such as
Comitative and Plural, although, whilst the Comitative suffix expresses a relation that holds between individual nominal members of an NP, the Plural suffix indicates a relation
over the members of an NP; neither suffix relates
that holds the NP itself to the verb or clause as a whole. 3
The order oP case and non-case suffixes following the nominal root in Wagiman, despite being relatively fixed, can
still be considered within the notion of 'concentric' scoping': the last suffix is usually that one which has scope
over the entire NP and relates it to the verb or.predicate.
Non-case suffixes might only relate one nominal to another
in the NP (such as, for example, the Comitative suffix), and
the principle of concentric scope would therefore apply to
order them before any case suffix which has greater scope.
Case suffixes and non-case suffixes are thus described separately below.","[142, 143]"

Commands, and examples where the command has the perlocutive
effect of causing the action of the command to take place
(where ya'an has the sense of 'to order'), code the addressee directly in the verb pronominal prefix.
When the
addressee is an Oblique, there seems to be no required
interpretation that the reported utterance is a command
(although it can be one), and no perlocutionary effects are
implied; direct addressee examples of ya'an usually require
such an interpretation, however, and perlocutionary effects
are often implied.
Examples 8-6 and 8-7 illustrate these different interpretations. 8-6 merely reports a command to go away, with no
implication that the command was complied with, or that it
caused any later action on the part of the addressee, marked
here as an Oblique pronoun:

Example 8-7 contains the addressee directly as an object in
the pronominal prefix, and the implication here is a command
that was complied with; the interpretation here is that the
utterance had the effect of making the addressee comply:

man came and told me to go away (made me go away). 1
When the addressee is directly included in the prefix, its
grammatical person and number are uniquely available because
both agent and patient are specified unambiguously. When it
is not marked in the prefix, however, the addressee almost
always occurs as an overt Oblique pronoun, in strong contrast with the usually rare occurrence of free object pronouns for other finite verbs (cf 11.2)
Because only the
speaker is marked in the prefix in non-direct examples, the
consistent use of an Oblique object pronoun thus provides
crucial information to the hearer concerning the reference
of the addressee,.","[240, 241, 242]"
"Rather than the mere collocation of mood, tense and aspect
affixes, there is a distinct pattern for all affixes to
reflect a semantic scoping relation controlled from the
left. The firstprefix, whether it is the Desiderative
marker or a mood/aspect pronominal prefix, sets up the type
of subjective world envisioned by the speaker in relation to
the situation being described, and further affixes delimit
or specify more precisely tempore.1 and other information
concerning it within this world.
When tense or aspect suffixes do not occur on a root, the
information that they carry can be coasidered for various
reasons as not being required. Verb stems that contain only
a pronominal prefix and verb root are examples of this type
of minimal explicitness. The mood, tense and aspect system
as a whole is thus capable of fire subtleties of expression,
both when different suffixes are used and also when they are
not.
The scope of affixes on the finite verb is summarized diagrammatically in Figure 7-4, where parentheses mean an item
is optional, and brackets indicate scoping relations.
pigare 7-4Finite verb affix scope[(DES) [PREFIX + VERB ROOT ([SUFFIX ([SUFFIX]) I ) ] ]
The existence of affix scope for verb suffixes is not unusual, given that in many other Australian languages the order
of (nominal) suffixes is controlled by their scope and meaning (cf. )
However, nominal 'concentric' scope falls
over suffixes to the left (towards the nominal root), so
that they can be said to have 'rightwards' scope, and the
rightmost suffix has scope over those to the left. The
unusual feature of the Wagiman system, however, is that the
suffixes on the verb are under the control of those to their
left, quite the opposite of what is found on nominals.
Perhaps even more unusual is that the scoping control also
crosses the root to affect other affixes.","[213, 214]"
"In 'multiple object ' serial verb constructions there may be
either same-subject or switch-subject identity between serialized verbs, each of which is transitive, but each of which
has its own object (Crowley 1984:5).
In 'multiple object'
participle constructions, the participle is also transitive
and has a different nominal object from that of the finite
verb.
This effectively allows the inclusion of a second
overt patient nominal in the clause. Crowley (ibid.) states
that such serial verb constructions are diachronically unstable, and it is interesting to note that in Wagiman they
are also very rare.
In 9-7, the nominal garradin 'stone' is the object of the
participle berr'ma 'throw', and occurs as a second object
argument in the clause as a whole. There is same-subject
identity between the participle and the finite verb in 9-7

"1The potential list of descriptions would be quite long,
but the largest single group includes almost all the descriptions of Australian languages published in the Handbook
of Australian Languages series, edited by R.M.W. Dixon and
B.J. Blake. Apart from the descriptions by Dixon and Blake
themsleves, they include those oy Haviland (1979), Eades
(i979), Crowley (1983), Morphy (1983) and Keen (1983),\Arguments against such a classification have more recently
come from different directions.
Payne (1986) has argued
that the two terms represent prototypical poles on a multidimensional space, so that a formative might have more or
less particular 'derivational1 and 'inflectional' features;
these include whether or not it changes ma,jor category,
whether it is required by the syntax, whether it is productive and whether it has a predictable meaning. The clear
distinction between the two types is shown to be one that is
not necessarily universal within or across particular languages.
Australian languages which permit the occurrence of 'derivational' suffixes after 'inflectional' suffixes have proved
more problematic: examples from Jiwarli (Austin 1985) and
Kayardild (Evans 1985:65-6) illustrate contrastive variation
in the ordering of suffixes following a nominal root. Evans
(ibid.) has argued that the principle of 'concentric scoping', rather than 'inflection' and 'derivation', orders
suffixes in Kayardild in such a way that they have logical
scope over the entire preceding stem. Evans and Dench (ms.)
argue further that the same principle applies in most Australian languages, and can be used to account for ordering
characteristics normally described by the inflection/derivation parameter.
The tendency of particular suffixes to
occur in the same position relative to the root and other
suffixes can thus be explained in terms oi their individual
meaning.
Convincing evidence for the application of the principle in
a particular language can be found in examples where traditionally named derivational suffixes can occur, with contrastive meaning, after inflectional suffixes. No such clear
variation has been recorded for Wagiman, although some indeterminate evidence exists in the form of two examples where
a 'derivationalf suffix has been recorded occuring after a
case suffix. It has not been possible to repeat them, or to
elicit further similar types; they are discussed in 6.3.1
and 6.3.5 below.","[141, 142]"
"mono-syllabic words are also usually avoided by the addition
of an optional suffix to the root. For example, the verb
root ya- 'to go' is potentially able to occur as an open
syllable mono-syllabic word when it is coded for a 3sg subject and Perfective aspect (marked by zero morphological
realization in the prefix series; cf. Figure 7-1). Because
aspect and tense suffixes are optional, a potential CV monosyllabic word * e y a would be created if the root were left
unsuffixed.
In actuality, however, the Past tense marker
i
is always used to create the di-syllabic word 9-ya-ggi
'he/ she/it went'. 2
The copula verb root yu- 'to be' can also potentially occur
as an open mono-syllable for the same reason, but a synonymous di-syllabic root n i p i - also exists. Speakers from the
south-west of the Wagiman traditional area, such as Don
Liddy Balambal, and others in Pine Creek, always use nigiwhen the verb is coded for 3sg Perfective (ie. is marked
with 9-), and carries no tense suffix.
A potential open
syllable monosyllabic word is thus avoided, even though yais used commonly in other situations and with different
tense and aspect values.
\Closed syllable mono-syllabic words are acceptable, but only
occur for finite verbs when a mono-syllabic verb stem is
suffixed with the Punctual aspect marker - 0 , such as 9-bu-0
'He/she/it hit (it), or when a di-syllabic participle loses
its final syllable for Punctual aspect marking, as in gal'
'climb-PCT', from gal'ma 'climb-UNM'.and suffixes in the
discussed in ChapterVowel sequences, glide+vonel and vowel+glide
sequences2,1m4Words with sequences of identical vowels have been discussed
at some length above, and so will not be discussed further
here. However, a slightly problematic area is the analysis
of vocalic sequences of the type [ail and [au], which can be
considered either as VCV sequences of the type /ayi/ and
/awu/ in order to maintain systematic CVCV syllabic sequences, or as sequences of two vowels /ail and /au/ in (C)VV
syllables, or finally as vowel+glide sequences of the type
lay/ and /aw/.
In many Australian languages word-initial sequences of /wu/
and /yi/ are generally realized as [u] and [i] respectively,
while sequences of a glide with a different vowel often
require the realization of the glide itself, so that /wa/ is
usually [wa], and /yu/ usually [yu] (Dixon 1980:146).
The
data for Wagiman suggests that some glide-initial words must
be contrasted with vowel-initial words. The vowel-initial
interjection ilkawu [ilkawu] 'that's right' canaot be pronounced with a phonetic glide as *[yilkawu], and contrasts
with glide-initial yirip 'pig-nose turtle', which is never
*[iriq], but always [yiriq]. The initial syllable of ulkuni
'maleficant supernatural being', is never pronounced with an
initial [w], and contrasts with wudyinma 'Dolly Huddleston'
which is never realized without it. Contrasts between initial /u/ and /wu/ and initial /i/ and /yi/ are therefore
required.
In medial position rare sequences of [au], [awu], [awl,
[iwu] and [ail and [ay] are found. [au] and [awu] are both
anlaysed as /awu/ phonemically. gakawurin 'long yarn', can
be either [kakaurin] or [kakawurin]; a distinct glide can be
heard in intervocalic position in the second realization and
is taken as being und,erlying. [awl occurs in the Unit Location suffix -ubawu, typically pronounced as [ubaw], and
only in slow citation speech as [ubawu] or, occasionally, as
[ubau].","[91, 92, 93]"
"Within the class of nominals, various sub-classes can be
determined, as follows:
Pronouns: nominals which refer to the speech
act participants themselves, and which can have anaphoric
reference to other nominals;
(1)(ii)
Demonstratives: nominals which indicate reference to a particular nominal, or to a real world object or
place through reference to the speech act participants as
loci of relative proximity;
(iii)
Interrrogative pro-forms:
nominals which
function as interrogative items, and which have meanings
such as 'what', ' whof, 'where' etc.
The classification of pronouns as a distinct sub-class is
justifiable on semantic and syntactic grounds. Their semantic differences (involving personal deictic reference) are
apparent, but they also differ from other nominals syntactically in not being able to be the nominal head of a predicative possessive pronoun (see 5.2).
There also exists the
series of pronominal prefixes which occur on verbs (see
Chapter 7).
These are not 'free' like other nominals and
are thus in a separate distributional class, but their notional and functional similarity to free pronouns means that,
while they may not be classified as pronouns themselves,
they can be classified at least as pronominal verb-adjuncts.
Demonstratives are also easily defined on semantic grounds,
and it is of descriptive value to oppose them both to pronouns and other sub-classes of nominal~as a group.
Interrogative pro-forms can be defined syntactically because
they mark a distinct mood category of interrogation. Because they can be marked for case and also occur in core
grammatical functions, they are clearly in the same paradigmF1
i1
tclass as other nominals described here.
Although 'interrogation' is elsewhere in the language a semantic distinction, and is not marked morphologically or syntactically,
interrogative pro-forms can be seen as a clear sub-class of
nominals (cf. 10.3).
It will be noted that no sub-class (or class) of 'adjectives' is proposed. The sub-classification of predicate
nominals (adjectives), as distinct from argument nominals is
slightly problematic, On syntactic, morphological and distributional grounds there is no basis for distinguishing a
class of adjectives, either closed or open, in the lang-II
I
1uage.
However, some nominals are highly likely to occur
predicatively, while for others this is less likely.
Although a semantic distinction between predicate nominals
and argument nominals can be drawn relatively clearly in
Wagiman between words such as 'woman' or 'meat food ' , which
are less likely predicates, and 'soft' or 'hard', which are
less likely arguments, many nominals,can function equally as
both. Furthermore, all predicatively used nominals can
almost certainly be used as argumentsea Words such as those
given can therefore be seen as part of a functional continuum for nominals that would include all the sub-classes of
cominals in the language, with argument function at one
pole, and predicate function at the other.","[105, 106, 107]"
"Wagiman occur in Mangarayi, where the non-inflec.ting elements, described as 'particles', are free items and are not
attached phonologically or morphologically to their I auxiliary' (Merlan 1982:52). 4
Functional similarities between Mangarayi particles and
Wagiman participles are broad, but differences are also
clearly discernable, particularly in the lack of aspect
marking on Mangarayi particles, and the semantic dominance
of the particle in expressing the meaning of the verbal
construction (op. cit.:124),
Nevertheless, a simple 'particle + auxiliary' analysis is
essentially unsatisfactory for Wagiman because it fails to
take into account the fact that participles are quite distinct predicates in their ability to have individual object
and subject arguments; the transitivity of a clause can be
altered by the transitivity of the participle, and in
already transitive clauses, a further overt nominal argument
can be introduced into the clause (see 9.2.1; transitivity
has also been discussed in 6.2.1).
Moreover, the subject or.
agent of participles and the finite verb in a clause need
not be identical, as in switch subject and multiple object
constructions, while in some others (ambient constructions),
participles share no arguments at all with the finite verb
(again, see 9.2.1 above).
In a 'particle + aux' structure,
the particle is assumed to have the same arguments as the
aux, and the two are given effectively as a unit verbal
constituent; this is clearly not the case in Wagiman participle structures,
'* In the Pama-Nyungan language Warlpiri , spoken well to the
south of both Wagiman and Mangarayi, some 'adverbial preverbs' can also be separated from their 'main verb' , either
to a position directly following the verb instead of directly preceding it, or to sentence-final position (Nash 1982:
180-1).","[332, 333]"

other combinations would be otherwise affected.
Ergative
case suffixation on the agent is a pragmatic feature, like
the presence or absence of the full, nominal itself, *and is
not required in underlying structure. Rules for the expansion of the pronominal slots would be quite simple: only
nominals agreeing in number and person could be employed.
Pronouns, by lexical definition, are marked for person and
number, while alJ other unmarked items (full nominals) would
be considered 3rd person only.
Examples where a 3pl free
nominal is represented in the verb by a 3sg prefix can be
considered a result of the relative newness of 3pl marking
in the prefix system (see 7 . 4 . 2 ) , which would originally
have specified 3rd person only, unmarked for number.
Such a structure does not preclude a verb-dependent analysis
for participles in finite clauses, although a 'serial'
analysis is still possible. There are advantages in both
approaches. In a serial analysis, the participle would be
placed outside the verb under a separate node, as the proposed original serial verbs might originally have occurred,
as follows:PARTVNPVPARTlagibanlagiban
manwiltma
8-ya-ggi
3sg:PFV-go-PAST walk'The man walked along.'
Participles must be specified in the lexicon for transitivity, and therefore must have potential slots for either one
or two arguments, although various restrictions apply to the
realization of these slots. Clearly, most participle constructions have one argument in common wi.th the finite verb
in the clause, usually the subject or agent. This can be
taken here as a virtual syntactic restriction; switch-subject constructions are no longer productive, occurring only
as they do with the participle boda 'die', so that they can
be analysed as possible relics of an earlier syntax; they
are now perhaps even idiomatic. Ambient constructions can
be seen in the same light, as they also occur with only one
participle (dyoroma 'return') in a synchronically fixed
construction. The subject or agent of the participle thus
never appears overtly in any way that identifies it differently from that of the finite verb, and an object argument
slot only is required for it. Intransitive participles
would have no argument slot at all. Where an overt participle object does not appear (due to pragmatic factors
identical with those which work for finite verb actant realization), it can be taken to be co-referential with that ofii.II

twice in a single clause where it is co-referential. In
other cases, however, multiple-object constructions occur.

the approximate resultant underlying structure:V1%PART.-bu-warren8warre-yi

For a same-subject construction where the object is co-referential, the structure would have the shape described in
11-53.
Multiple-participle constructions occur when there are two
participle nodes in underlying structure, although no examples of multiple-object constructions have been elicited for
them, and they are more than likely not possible. A probable reason would be the referentiality problems that would
arise in matching object arguments with particular participles; the assignment of an object to a participle is based
on the fact that the other arguments in the clause are unambiguously assigned to the finite verb, and the one remaining
is assumed to belong to the participle.","[342, 343, 344, 345]"

The Possessive pronouns are used for both alienable and
inalienable possession when the genitive head is a pronominal referent. However, inalienable possession is not
overtly marked when the genitive head is a full noun. In
such cases the possessed and possessor nominals are merely
placed in apposition. Unlike the more restricted ordering
for NPs containing Possessive pronouns, the order of genitive head and possessed item in cases of inalienable possession is less fixed. The fact that it is always far more
apparent from the context and pragmatic factors of such
situations which particular item is the possessed or possessor seems to underlie such freedom:

the source of the entire form itself is not certain.
However, it can be seen in Figure 7-1 above that gu- marks
3sg in the Potential series, as well as 2pl in the Imperfective series. It is not clear how these forms developed,
but it is possible that the -gu in the transitive prefixes

that this analysis is generally possible. On the other

An examination of Ngalakan pronominal prefixes yields a
possible loan source for -dyu-: the form ju- occurs as a

"IWhile there is only a small number of actual speakern, a
larger number of individuals identify themselves as being
'Wagiman' people. The name 'Wagiman', however, is primarily
a language name, and individuals identify with the language,
not on the basis of their use of it, but on the basis of
their ownership of it. Thus the term 'language owning
group' is used to define those individuals who identify
themselves with the language name, irrespective of whether
they actually speak the language (Chase and Meehan 1983:
8-9).
The terms 'Wagiman people' and 'Wagiman language
owning group' are used interchangeably here, but contrast
with 'Wagiman speakers'. Like speakers, members of the
language owning group are still relatively few in number:
there are perhaps 40 individuals who would claim identification with the group, and many are young children or young
adults. Most live in Pine Creek, while some non-speakers,
other than Lulu Martin Dalpalngali, live in Darwin. Many

Huddleston Benbo and his father George Huddleston Yalkpayarri, mainly in the form of simple sentences and lexical
items. They also provided many of the later research leads
through examples of the basic morphology as well.
Paddy
Huddleston Benbo is a relatively young speaker of the language (perhaps no older than 50), and was often not sure of
some words or constructions. He referred these cases to his
mother, Dolly Huddleston Wudyinma, for help; through personal observation, Wudyinma seems to be the best speaker of
Wagiman alive today, although she was never interested in
teaching the language. She was quite content, however, to
be the arbiter of any disputes or problems which arose in
the course of the work, and all considered her to be the
expert on the language and culture. The narrative text she
provided (Text DHW 1 in Appendix 1) was an exception to her
normal reticence; on the other hand, her husband Yalkpayarri
was an enthusiastic and interested participant, although his
lack of teeth, poor English and some interference from other
languages in the area made data from him difficult to understand, and often unreliable. Both Yalkpayarri and Wudyinma
are old, perhaps in their mid-seventies , while Yalkpayarri
is almost blind and often incapacitated by illness.
In 1984, several productive sessions were recorded with
Douglas Jack Milguyarri at Douglas Station. He has lived
and worked most of his life there in order to be near his
traditional land at dyuwalun (Douglas Hot Water Springs).
He is perhaps about 60 years of age. His control of some
traditional vocabulary (mainly flora terms) is not always
complete, although he is a fluent speaker in other ways.
Much of the more complex materisl and many freely produced
utterances were also recorded from Lulu Martin Dalpalngali,
his younger sister in Darwin. Lulu was an excellent informant, and'had a wealth of knowledge of traditional culture; a

her enthusiasm, found long sessions extremely taxing.
Small amounts of material were recorded from Max 'Banjo'
Banderson Idyindin of Adelaide River and his half brother
'Jindare' George Allen Mundeng, who died in 1984. 1
Generally, however, there were great difficulties in getting
speakers to provide any material at all. Some, such as
Dolly Huddleston Wudyinma, were never particularly interested, while for most others, such as Don Liddy Balambal, the
researcher was an initial object of curiosity, but soon
became too taxing. Age was also a problem, and relatively
young individuals, such as Paddy Huddleston Benbo, were
found eventually not to be adequate speakers for the complexity of language being sought; on the other hand, his
father George Yalkpayarri was quite simply incomprehensible
to a non-speaker of 'heavy' Kriol.
It is also probably true that all the speakers of Wagiman in
Pine Creek had alcohol problems at the time of the research,
making them often difficult to find, or to rely on to work
at any previously arranged time. On returning to Pine Creek
in 1984, a period of more than two months passed without any
significant language material having been recorded, and it
became clear that other speakers would have to be found.

sounds like it.
Wagiman people do not currently seem to
have any strong restrictions on repeating the names of recently deceased people, although there is occasionally some
hesitation for Mundeng. On this basis I will provide names
of deceased Wagiman people in the text where relevant. However, readers should take note that tact and care must be
used if referring to these people in front of their relatives and frienos, or in publications or written material ofthe research with Douglas Jack Milguyarri and Lulu ldartin
Dalpalngali, who were quite felicitously interested and
willing to teach the language.
Fieldwork and fieldwork methodsThis description is the result of several field trips to
work with speakers of Wagiman living in the 'Top Endi area
of the Northern Territory, primarily during the dry winter
season between March and August, over the period 1983-85.
My first trip, from May to August in 1983, did not yield a
great deal of linguistic material, but primarily enabled the
development of personal contacts with speakers. Basic grammatical data and a relatively short list of lexical items
were also collected. In 1984 I spent six months in the
field, in an attempt, with varying success, to gather more
complex material and texts.
I also acquired a four-wheel
drive vehicle to go on bush trips with speakers in order to
facilitate the process. In June and July of the following
year, I collected what was effectively the last material for
the description, and managed to complete pronoun and prefix
paradigms which were still incomplete, and generally to
follow up as many of the leads indicated by the earlier
research as possible.
Most of the fieldwork period in 1983 and 1984 was spent in
the small township of Pine Creek, situated approximately 220
km south-east of Darwin on the Stuart Highway, the sole road
Between
south from Darwin to Alice Springs (see map 2).
five and six speakers of Wagiman were living there at that
time.
Some time was also spent in Darwin itself, working
with Lulu Martin Dalpalngali, who lived nearby, and also at
Douglas Station (approximately 170 km south-east of Darwin)
where Douglas Jack Milguyarri lived. The two months fieldwork in 1985 were spent entirely in Darwin, working with
Lulu Dalpalngali. When not staying in Pine Creek I lived in
a tent, which created some problems in organizing field
sessions, forward planning and so on.","[23, 24, 25, 26]"
"85Chapter 4Word classesApart from morphological formatives (prefixes and suffixes)
that indicate grammatical relations such as tense, aspect,
mood or nominal grammatical function, all lexical items fall
into one of several particular word classes, or 'parts of
speech'.
Affixes are members of the class of 'adjuncts',
(following Schachter 1985:35-45) and can be further classified into sub-classes such as 'nominal-adjuncts', 'verbadjuncts' and so forth. Although clearly 'parts of speech',
they are not lexical words and are not described here, but
are left to those chapters which deal with the morphology of
the various word-classes to which they attach themselves.
This chapter sets out to define the major classes of words
(lexical items) which can be grammatically distinguished in
Wagiman, and which are referred to in the description.
These definitions are, by their nature, language specific;
their description at this point provides the basis. for following descriptions of their function and morphology without
redundancy.
It is, moreover, typologically interesting to
define precisely what each class comprises; word classes in
different languages which have the same name caa have subtly
or widely differing members (Schachter 1985:l-3).
The primary criteria for assignment of lexical items to
particular word classes are grammatical: the properties of
lexical items considered as bases for class membership are
distribution, range of possible syntactic functions, and
morphological or syntactic categories for which they are
specifiable (Schachter loc. cit.).
This provides a minimal number of five classes only in Wagiman: those that can carry case suffixes and co-occur with
VERBS are NOMINALS; those that can carry pronominal prefixes
and tense and aspect suffixes, and which can eithep occur
alone or with one or two NOMINALS are VERBS; those that do
not carry pronominal prefixes, but carry aspect marking andII
Iwhich can occur alone or with VERBS and NOMINALS are PARTICIPLES; those that do not carry any affixation at all and
which occur with VERBS are ADVERBS, while those which can
occur alone as whole utterances are INTERJECTIONS.","[103, 104, 105]"

"+[DJM 4841IThe Oblique in 5-32 could be analysed as an Allative complement of the finite verb ma(-yi) ' to get' , but it is never
otherwise an intransitive verb.
It is possible that the
participle nqaynaqay requires an oblique, rather than a direct, object complement and the Oblique pronoun is an argument of the participle; most other participles are either
strictly transitive or intransitive, however (see 11.5).fThe use of an Oblique in 5-32 does seem to be linked to
transitivity, where an Oblique object codes reduced impingement on the patient.
Certainly, in that example there is
very little direct impingement on the object of the waving,
and such an analysis seems reasonable in isolation. The
other examples still remain more problematic from this point
of view because of their varying degrees of transitivity and
the lack of correspondence between apparent impingement and
the pronoun object used. These examples must currently be
considered beyond explanation,
5.4Demonstratives and spatial deixisThree of the four demonstratives and several other nominals
and adverbs have 'spatial deixis' functions, defined by
Fillmore (1982:37) as:
'that aspect of deixis which involves referring to
the locations in space of the communication act
participants; it is that part of spatial semantics
which takes the bodies of the communication act
participants as significant reference objects for
spatial specification.'
Excluded from the definition is the set of location words
that take as their reference point some object other than
the speaker or hearer. These are non-deictic adverbial
'locating expressions' (op, cit.:43) and are treated separately below in 10.1.
Also excluded is the demonstrative
dyaean 'that1 which has discourse anaphoric value only, but
which is described in the current section. The deicticdemonstratives themselves can also have discourse anaphoric
functions, in which they do not express spatial relationships.
The demonstratives have two primary syntactic functions:
they are used as third person free pronuns, where they refer
to people, locations or objects in the real world; and they
are used as demonstrative modifiers of another full nominal.
The demonstrative ga8,an 'that, there' can also be used as a
definite article in its demonstrative function. They are
paradigmatically identical with other nominals, and can be
marked with various suffixes, including locational cases.

to reference to an item previously mentioned in discourse,while the deictic demonstratives are not so restricted.
Forms for all four demonstratives and their semantic functions, as well as for other deictics, are given in Figure 5-4
above.tI
IIA three-way distance contrast is specified by the spatial
deictics, based on relative distance from the speaker (the
distance category terms in Figure 5-4 are from Fillmore
1982).
The categories [Proximal], [Medial] .and [Distal]
are based on relative distance from the speaker, which Fillmore (op. cit.:48) describes as 'speaker pivot', where the
distance referred to by the deictic is based on that from
the speaker. A second possible type of pivot for deictic
systems is 'hearer pivot' where distances are based on those
from the hearer.
In the following sections, the deictics
are defined in terms of their 'pivot' and distance category.
5,4,1Demonstratives5.4,1,1ma'an[Proximal]:'here, this, this onemma'an is used-to refer to items which are relatively close
to the speaker and which are in both the speaker and hearer's field of view. Items referred to with ma'an are also
interpreted as being specific, presumably as a result of the
requirement that they be in the visual field at the time of
the utterance, for example:
5-33la 'an man.an paniggin

"Chapter 10Adverbs, interjections and interrogationAdverbs and interjections form closed classes which contain
a small number of members only. Adverbs have mood, spatial
position and temporal marking functions, and can modify noun
phrases, verbs or whole clauses. Some of the 16 recorded
adverbs have more than one meaning, or two or more closely
connected meanings. For example, dyumbany can have the
spatial meaning 'behind' or the temporal meaning 'afterwards, last', while gorro can mean either 'tried but failed'
or 'later'.
The class of interjections includes the words wi'ya 'no' and
yaray 'yes'. There is also a word gale which generally
occurs in clause-final position as a tag question, but can
also occur alone to mean 'Is that true?' or 'Really?'. Its
word class membership is thus somewhat difficult to define,
but is described with interjections in 10.2 below.
Polar interrogati,on is signalled by a marked intonation
pattern over the sen.tence as a whole. So-called 'WH' questions variously involve the use of interrogative nominals,
adverbs or a participle, depending on what is being questioned in the clause. The interrogative nominals can also
have case-marking, again depending on sentential requirements.
10.1AdverbsAdverbs form a small closed class whose members have a relatively limited range of meanings. Their semantic functions
include the expression of sentential mood values, such as
negation, doubt and non-completion of the activity described
by the verb or predicate. Also included is a group of nondeictic locating expressions which indicate the spatial
position of one NP relative t r ~another, such as 'on top' ,
'behind' and so on.
In a notional definition of adverbs
these words would be excluded from membership in the classbecause they do not modify a verb or a sentence. Scme meanings expressed by Wagiman adverbs would be included in three
distinct word classes in some other Australian languages,
described as 'adverbals', 'locational qualifiers' and 'part'Locational qualifiers' desicles' (Dixon 1980:281-84).
cribed by Dixon can often be inflected, however, although
'particles' are usually uniuflecting (ibid.).
The class
designated by Dixon as 'adverbals' have the same morphological possibdlites as verbs, and thus do not corespond to
Wagiman 'adverbs'. It should be recalled that the primary
criteria for the definition of word classes given in Chapter
4 were grammatical:
distribution, range of possible syntactic functions and specifiable morphological categories.
Despite their apparently disparate meanings, Wagiman
'adverbs' are classified together because of their similar
grammatical characteristics; the term 'adverb' is chosen
because a major notional function of the class is, in fact,
the modification of verbs and clauses.
101.1dyamba 'cannot, rill not, do not'dyarba has three distinct meanings depending on grammatical
context: (i) it is used to express the subject or agent's
inability to carry out the activity expressed by the verb;
(ii) it marks a lack of desire to carry out this activity;
and (iii) in finite verb imperatives it marks a negative
command not to carry out the activity (cf. 7.2.3).
Generally, context provides information to distinguish between
the 'lack of desire1 and 'inability' meanings; often, however, the distinction is not clear or contextually required,
and 'cannot' and 'will not' are indistinguishable. The
unifying feature of these three meanings is that they all
deny, apart from negating, the possibility expressed by the
predicate of the clause. dyamba is thus used only for
irrealis situations, and is thus glossed as 'Irrealis negative' (IRR NEG):-10-1ga-qa-bu

"9.2.2.3Orientational participle functionThis function is very restricted, and to a certain extent
corresponds to the ambient structural use of participles.
However, two forms, werr'ma and lema have been recorded
whose function appears to be one of orienting the action in
space and direction. The specific function and meaning of
these two words is highly dependent on the finite verb with
which they occur, but typically they describe the directional orientation of the action. Generally, rerr'ma means
'(action) (occur) outside', but can also be used to state
that the direction of the action or state was 'outwards' in
relation to something else. lema is similar, and means
'(action) (occur) inside', or '(action) inwards'. Both can
thus be used in predicate adjective function with a copula
verb to mean 'be inside' and 'be outside'.
They usually occur in same-subject constructions, but the
link between the subject or agent of the finite verb and the
apparent subject or agent argument of the participle is not
always clear:
9-30werr'ma

3sg:IPFV-come-PRESqurun
sun[LMD 5851'The sun is coming up. I
rerr'ma
exit9-da-gin
3sg:PFV-eat-PPCT[LMD 7851'He vomited (the water). I
The explicit incluson of a nominal object such as 'water' or
'food' in examples like 9-31 has not been recorded, but the
context seems to indicate that it would be the object of da'to eat'. 33da-yi means 'to eat' in its unmarked use, but can also
mean generally ' to ingest ' when :ised with' participles, permitting an interpretation of either 'eat ' or 'drink' , depending on the participle.
%Prompt examples in Wagiman with overt nominal objects presented to Lulu Martin Dalpalngali were not contradicted by
her, but she did not provide examples herself in response.
No examples of lema with a transitive finite verb have been
recorded :

in order to remain syllable-final.
Because it is always
syllable-final in words in class (i), it does not move during suffixation or elision of the stem (see 1.4 above).
Another point illustrated in Figure 9-1 is the occurrence of
a palatal glide / y / following'final /a/ in the unmarked form
when it is followed by case marking. The presence of a
glide here is somewhat similar to the alternation of the
glottal stop with / y / in suffixed demonstrative roots (see
3.4 above), and an underlying glottal stop could be proposed
as word-final in all participles to account for it. There
is, however, little phonetic justification for the proposition, because no phonetic glottal stop has been recorded in
final position. Although this could possibly have been due
to the fact that it is optional here, as in other environments, other words containing a glottal stop can be recognized, at least occasionally, by a distinct glottal closure.
In any case, the glide is included in the stem in transcriptions.","[253, 254]"
"-The intransitive forms are given in the transitive matrix
(Figure 7-2) as marking 3sg objects. This is not strictly
true in formal terms, however, because no separate identification of the object can be made from the forms themselves:
they mark an intransitive subject only, or the agent only of
a transitive clause with a 3sg patient. Rather than propose
that the same forms are used 'transitively' to mark 3sg
patients with a zero marked patient, and then 'intransitively' to cover 3sg subject function with no patient, the data
in fact indicates that 3sg objects merely remain unmarked in
the sytem.
The use of intransitive subject prefixes to mark transitive
agents as well suggests that they were originally in a nominative/accusative case frame, representing both S and A, at
an earlier stage of the language. This would be true historically if the modern -n- and -0- are, in fact, reflexes of
an original accusative case marker. However, a synchronic
analysis reveals no association of prefix forms with a particular case frame, and the whole system has become virtuallylo
The value of lexicographic comparison as a basis for
assessing genetic relatedness does not appear to be very
useful in the Western Arnhem Land region, where languages
seem in general to have borowed very little vocabulary from
each other.
Heath (1978b), however, provides examples of
non-lexical diffusion through apparently unrelated languages.",[230]
"In 9-30 for example, where the sun is 'exiting', ( 'coming
up') it is apparent that it is the subject of both the 'coming' and the 'exiting'. In 9-31, however, where the lexical
meaning of the finite verb and participle compound is 'to
vomit', it is not obvious that the subject of the finite
In

fact, it would seem here that the object of the finite verb
(the water) is the subject of the participle. However, in
another sense, the subject of the finite verb is also the
subject of the participle when the clause is translated as
'I ate the water in an outwards manner'.
These two participles have a semantic function which produces sentences similar to ambient constructions, in which
the participle has no nominal arguments, and provides only a
general predication about the world. The orientational
function described above provides a spatial frame for the
action in a direct physical sense; ambient participle constructions provide this in a more general, less obvious manner.",[273]
"The count for Wagiman does not include roots which can
also occur as participles. It also counts meanings rather
than roots, and if another language has two verbs where
Wagiman has one with two meanings, or vice versa, then the
meaning is counted twice.i
:d,In this structure, any NP arguments must be reflected pronominally in the finite verb prefix. However, material described above indicates that arguments of participles are not
subcategorized by the finite verb at all; structures of the
type given in 11-48 are therefore inadequate. The problem
arises more clearly with examples that contain two object
arguments, where one belongs to the participle and the other
to the finite verb (as in 11-46 above).lagibangarradinlagiban garradin gal'ma

In fact, this particular problem touches upon the wider
problem of underlying structures which it is worth discussing here.
In many sentences which contain finite verbs,
actants in the clause do not occur expressed as overt nominals or pronouns, but have reference only in the verbal prefix. If it is assumed that phrase structures (or any other
type of basic structures) are composed of obligatory NP
slots which are cross-referenced onto the verb, then some
sort of reduction rule would have to apply to a majority of
clauses.
Such a rule is not improbable, but it has been
shown in other sections (cf. 7.1) that the pronominal function of prefixes is not necessarily cross-referencing.
Moreover, overt nominal reference to participants is often
used for presenting new information, or for other discoursestrategies (cf. 11.2 above); the unmarked
.,.
structure in numerical and discourse terms is to have no overt nominal reference and such a rule would therefore seem to be unmotivated.
Rather than considering a basic underlying sentence
structure to be one where NP slots are initially filled,
usually by pronouns, with mapped features in the finite verb
prefix (which, in any case is not always true, cf. examples
8-1 to 8-4), and which are then typically emptied again by
the application of some sort of deletion rule, it is more
economical and appropriate to propose that the reverse holds
true. In this case, underlying clause structure would have
slots in the verb prefix filled first, with an optional
restatement of the prefix as overt nominal arguments in
response to discourse requirements.
Such an approach to
languages similar in type to Wagiman has been discussed by
Jelinek (1985).
The implications for underlying structure description here
are that, in a simple sentence without a participle, rather
than having NP slots and a verb slot in a clause, S (sentence) would be rewritten only by V (ie. S
V), and the V
would contain slots for either one or two pronomin~lreferents, depending on lexically defined transitivity.
These
would be optionally expanded into full nominals (including
pronouns, in this case) only if required for pragmatic purposes.
Example 11-50 describes this in approximate terms
for a simple transitive sentence, in which the lsg item is
not expressed as an overt nominal (defined by Hale 1983:7 as
'null anaphora').","[340, 341, 342]"
"In same-subject constructions, both the participle and the
finite verb have the same nominal subject or agent. This is
also the most common participle sentence type to be found
(in all the following participle examples, the participle is
underlined; unmarked participles are not overtly indicsted
in the inter-linear gloss):

lsg-bedya'an-gunda
something-ABL[GHY 831'I am sick from something (I don't know what).'
In switch-subject sentences, the patient of the finite verb
occurs as the subject of the participle. Such constructions
are limited to the finite verb bu-ni 'to hit, kill' and the
participle boda 'die', but are also quite common. In 9-4
the object of bu-ni is also the subject of bot (from the
unmarked stem boda):

ga-qa-bu-q
DES-lsg-hit-PPCTbot
die-PCT[LMD 5851'I wanted to follow him and hit him, I wanted to
kill him dead.'
An interesting example also occurs with a reciprocal marked
finite verb, where the individual actors in the action are
simultaneously agents, patients and subjects. In 9-5 the
Potential reflexive suffix on bu- 'to kill' indicates thatthe 3pl subject (agent) marked on the verb is also the patient, while being at the same time the intransitive subject
of boda 'die':
9-5guba-bu-dyi-gana
3pl:POT-kill-POTREF-INCLboda-vu-ma[LMD 6851die-EMPH-FOC'They will fight and kill each other.'
Apart from boda 'die', one other participle has been recorded in a switch-subject construction; it is a somewhat
unusual example because it refers to a non-traditional event
in Aboriginal culture. In 9-6 it is clearly the horses, and
not their owners, who are going racing; the object of the
finite verb ga- 'to take' (the horses) occurs as the 'subject' of the participle duduta 'run':

"No historical conclusions present themselves from these
comparisons, but there is plainly a link of some sort
between the forms of the various pronouns. Such a putative
link is made more clear when the possessive function of the
Oblique pronouns is compared with that of the Possessive
pronouns themselves (see 5.3.5), and the use of Oblique
pronouns in an apparent direct object function (see 5.3.6).kThe alternant forms gogin and guggugin for 2sg in the Possessive pronoun series can be examined in comparison with
the 2sg Oblique form. The Possessive form gogin is clearly
unrelat3d to the 2sg Oblique g q g u , but q q g u g i n follows the
pattern whereby the Possessive pronoun is the same as the
Oblique form, but with the addition of the apparent suffix
-gin. Thus 2sg Possessive qur~guginseems to be a back-formation from 2sg OBL quggu, and seems to be completely interThe possible dialectal reason for
changeable with gogin.
the variation is difficult to isolate from different speakers' own apparently idiolectal variation, although they all
seemed to accept, and could provide, both forms. For the
moment, they can only be considered as free variants.
The Oblique pronouns have a variety of grammatical functions, although these all (except (vi) below) seem to be
linked by the 'obliqueness' of their referents' relationship
with the clausal predicate; they can be summarized as fol-they specify the pronominal object complement
of some intransitive verbs and clauses;
they express the pronominal benefactive complement of a verb or clause;
they are used to express pronominal allative
and locative complements of a clause, as well as the indirect addressee of the verb yawan 'to say';101
( iv)they express the topic of a story ('about
someone') or the subject matter of an action or process;(v)
they function as markers of possession in a
manner similar to, but subtly different from, the Possessive
pronouns; and
(Ti)
they occur marking an affected
patient in an apparent accusative function.pronominalAll these functions are semantically linked, with the exception of (vi) , where they apparently refer to NPs in a considerably more direct relation with the predicate. The
feature common to the majority is that they express the idea
that an activity or object in the clause is linked in some
loose way with the referent of the pronoun, either in terms
of locational or figurative association, benefit or possession. This shared feature can be seen in all the examples
given below, and explains why it is possible that the Obiique pronouns can be used in such an apparently wide range
of functions.
Where the Oblique pronouns are used to express the complement of an intransitive clause or the beneficiary of 'an action, a relevant feature is also reduced transitivity: the
action is not directly impinging upon the referent of the
pronoun as in more transitive clauses with an Absolutive
object or goal. The link between the predicate action and
the Oblique pronoun is thus only one of loose, rather than
tightly involved, semantic association.
The same situation can be found with the other associative
and possessive uses of the Oblique pronouns: the referent
of the pronoun is linked with the action, or as in the case
of possession, with another nominal as well, by an oblique
association only, and the hearer determines from context and
the syntactic structure of the utterance which interpretation is appropriate.i
\+/The Oblique pronouns can be used in the place of some noncore case (Absolutive or Ergative) pronouns, and examples
with Obliques substituted for Allative, Dative and Possessive forms have been recorded. The fact that the Obliques
do not fulfil any function that is not already potentially
expressed by case-marked Base pronouns is puzzling. Moreover, rather than being as explicit as Allative or Dative
(Benefactive) marked pronouns, the Oblique pronouns merely
specify a general oblique relationship. It is also not
possible in some examples to derive an explicit interpretation of either an Allative or Benefactive relation because
both can seem equally appropriate in the context.
Their
proper function might be, in fact, that they can be used
where no precise interpretation is intended or required;
there is some evidence to suggest that where a specific
statement is being made, then overtly case marked Base pronouns are used.
The contrast between the Possessive pronouns and the Oblique pronouns in possessive function is of
this type.: the 0bl.iqe pronouns appear to imply a looser
sense of possession, one more of association between objects
rather than strict ownership (see 5.3.5).
Importantly here, in the examples where the Oblique pronouns
are used for pronominal referents that are apparently in a
direct object relation with their predicate, there is some
doubt that a highly transitive relation actually holds.
This is examined in 5.3.6.
