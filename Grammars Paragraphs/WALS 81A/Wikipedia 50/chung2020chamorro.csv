‘Why did she do it like that?’ (EM 94)Notice that in (49a), the adjective chaddik ‘fast’ agrees with the subject. The
agreement reveals that chaddik is the predicate of the clause, and not an
adverb. (Compare (41b), where chaddik serves as an adverb.) The adjectives båba ‘bad’ in (49b) and taiguennåo ‘like that’ in (49c) likewise agree
with the subject, but that agreement is not realized by any special morphology (see 2.2.2.2.1).
The fact that these constructions occur frequently in Chamorro may be
related to lexical resources: as mentioned in Chapter 18, the language has no
productive means of deriving adverbs from other parts of speech. (See also
14.2.2 on existential clauses, Chapter 21 on infinitive clauses, and Chapter
24 on relative clauses.)60Clauses3.4Word order3.4.1 The predicate and its arguments
Chamorro is a predicate-first language. In neutral clauses—clauses that
could be used to answer the questions ‘What happened?’, ‘What is the situation?’, or ‘Why?’—the predicate comes first, followed by its arguments.

mother-AGR the can LCL

under.L the leaf.L galak
‘My mother put the can back again under the galak leaf.’ (EM 98)The predicate’s part of speech determines the word order of arguments that
are independent constituents—noun phrases, prepositional phrases, finite
embedded clauses, or infinitive clauses.4 The word order of arguments is
flexible when the predicate is a verb or adjective, but rigid when the predicate is a noun or preposition.
3.4.1.1
When the predicate is a verb or adjective
When the predicate is a verb or adjective, the order of arguments is flexible.
The dominant word order—the word order that occurs most often and is
volunteered first in elicitation contexts in fieldwork—is: Predicate Subject
Object Obliques. (Object here refers to the direct object.)

b. Ma na’påkpak kannai-ñiha i aodensia.
AGR make.clap hand-AGR
the audience
‘The audience clapped their hands.’ (CD, entry for åodensia)Still more word order options are available to the direct object. In addition to the word orders just described, the direct object can follow an
oblique. Many naturally-occurring examples of this pattern involve an
oblique noun phrase that is introduced by the null indefinite article. In (58), i
chalan-måmi ‘our (excl.) road’ is the direct object and båras ‘gravel’ is the
oblique.
(58)Ha nå’yi i taotåo båras i chalan-måmi.
AGR add.to the person gravel the road-AGR
‘The man put gravel on our (excl.) road.’ (CD, entry for båras)It remains unclear exactly when this word order is allowed, and how it interacts with the different word order options for the subject.
The overall message is that the word order of clauses formed from
verbs or adjectives is flexible. The word orders described above range from
very frequent (as in (51)) to reasonably frequent (58); all are attested in
naturally-occurring data. But once one goes beyond these patterns, it can be
hard to determine whether a particular word order seems natural or is merely
conceivable.
3.4.1.2
When the predicate is a noun or preposition
When the predicate is a noun or a preposition, the word order is PredicatePhrase Subject, where Predicate-Phrase refers to the entire noun phrase or
prepositional phrase formed from the predicate and its dependents. This
phrase includes the predicate’s arguments—except for the subject—as well
as modifiers and other material. In the clauses below, the predicate is a noun
and the predicate phrase is enclosed in brackets. (In (59d), the weak pronoun
yu’ ‘I’, which is the subject, occurs inside the predicate phrase; see 8.3.)
(59) a.",[89]
"19.6Coordinate verb phrases and word orderThe coordination of verb phrases and other predicate phrases interacts with
the word order of the subject. As described earlier (in 3.4.1.1), when the
predicate is a verb or adjective, the order of arguments following it is flexible. The dominant word order of clauses of this type is: Predicate Subject
Object Obliques, but the subject frequently occurs in other positions, such as
at the right edge of the clause or immediately after the object.
When the predicate is a coordinate verb phrase or a coordinate adjective
phrase, the subject can appear after the entire coordinate structure; see (24e)
and the following. (The subject is underlined in the examples below.)
(29) a.",[446]
"396Adverbs18.4Word orderOverall, adverbs have the same word order possibilities as other adjuncts in
Chamorro. They can occur at the left edge of the clause, at the right edge of
the clause, or after the predicate (in clauses formed from verbs or adjectives)
or after the predicate phrase (in clauses formed from nouns or prepositions).
These locations are marked with an x in the word order templates below (see
3.4.2, 3.4.3, and 4.1).

"4.1Negation, tense-aspect-mood, and word orderIn addition to the predicate, its arguments, and adjuncts, the clause can
contain two further elements: the sentential negative ti ‘not’ and a marker of
tense-aspect-mood (henceforth TAM). The TAM precedes the predicate, and
the negative ti precedes the TAM. This information is incorporated below
into the word order templates from the end of Chapter 3. (Recall that x is
used to mark the most common locations for adjuncts.)

"7.4Word orderChamorro word order is both predicate-first and head-first. Prepositions precede their object noun phrases (see 5.2), complementizers and subordinating
conjunctions precede the embedded clauses they introduce (see 20.1), and
nouns precede their arguments and adjuncts.
The word order of constituents is less flexible within the noun phrase
than it is within the clause. If prenominal possessors are set aside, noun
phrases formed from a head noun have a fixed word order. The determiner
or determiners come first, followed by the head noun, and then by the
possessor, obliques, and adjuncts, as shown in the template below.
(66)WORD ORDER OF CHAMORRO NOUN PHRASES (FIRST PASS)
Determiners Noun Possessor Obliques Adjuncts169It is more challenging to integrate modifiers into this template, given
their word order freedom and given that not all possible combinations of
modifiers, obliques, and adjuncts have been investigated. Still, some preliminary observations can be made.
Modifiers preceding the head noun occur between the head noun and the
determiner. When the head noun is preceded by two modifiers and one of
them is a relative clause, the relative clause tends to occur farther to the left,
preceding the other modifier (but see (54c) for the opposite word order).

‘There were rich people who had farms.’ (Cooreman 1983: 158)Note that the pre-head form of the linker occurs twice, once between the adjective and the noun and again between the relative clause and the adjectiveplus-noun constituent.
The word order of modifiers after the head noun is most straightforward
for relative clauses. Relative clauses that follow the head noun occur at the
right edge of the noun phrase, after the noun and any other dependents,
including obliques and adjuncts. See (60) and the following.

‘according to the monthly report (lit. the report by month) made by
the Department of Environmental Quality’ (Marianas Variety
November 6, 1979)The word order of the possessor with respect to adjective or noun phrase
modifiers following the head noun is determined by the marking on the head
noun. If the head noun shows possessor agreement, the possessor can
precede or follow the modifier.

If the head noun is marked with the post-head form of the linker, it is
phonologically dependent on the possessor, which must occur immediately
after it; the modifier occurs farther to the right.
(70)i che’lun

for noun phrases in (71), where x is used to mark the most common locations for modifiers. (The template does not specify exactly which types of
modifiers occur in these locations.)
(71)WORD ORDER OF CHAMORRO NOUN PHRASES (FINAL VERSION)
Determiner x Noun x Possessor x Obliques Adjuncts x7.5Noun phrase ellipsisLike many other languages, Chamorro has an ellipsis process that affects
noun phrases. This optional process deletes the head noun, along with the
possessor, arguments, and adjuncts, as long as certain other elements of the
noun phrase are left behind. The fact that the head noun is deleted means
that any marking associated with it—notably, the linker—does not appear.
The fact that the head noun is deleted along with the possessor, arguments,
and adjuncts suggests that these elements form a constituent within the noun
phrase that excludes determiners and modifiers.7 The deleted material is
understood to mean ‘one’ or ‘thing’. In generative grammar, this ellipsis
process is known as noun phrase ellipsis or N-bar ellipsis. It is called noun
phrase ellipsis here.
Noun phrase ellipsis in Chamorro can occur only if the part of the noun
phrase that is left behind—the part that is actually pronounced—contains a
demonstrative, numeral, quantifier, adjective, or relative clause. Some of the
possibilities are illustrated below. In (72), ellipsis has left behind a demonstrative (represented in boldface).","[194, 195, 196]"

‘My girlfriend really believes in magic power.’ (CD, entry for

focused constituent (see 19.7).

AGR lease3.4.3 Summary
Although the word order of Chamorro clauses is too flexible to be neatly
summarized in a single word order template, many of the facts just discussed67are captured by the templates below. In these templates, x is used to mark
the most common locations for adjuncts.

Carmen
‘Carmen is paying the men five dollars.’The fact that the word order Predicate Subject Object is strongly preferred
or required in cases of potential ambiguity suggests that this is the unmarked
word order.
On the other hand, there may be a preference for the word order Predicate Object Subject when the direct object contains a reflexive possessor
pronoun that is bound by the subject (see 13.2.1.1). But this preference, if it
exists at all, is slight. (The reflexive possessor and its antecedent are
underlined in the English translations below.)5In this example, either si Carmen and i lalåhi could be taken to be the subject. Both noun phrases are in the unmarked case, and both could be crossreferenced by the 3 sg. agreement on the verb, since 3 sg. agreement can be
used to cross-reference a plural subject that is collective (see 2.2.2.1). Both
noun phrases also name individuals who might plausibly pay money.

‘Bill doesn’t know how to fasten his belt.’ (CD, entry for goddi)Certain contexts can favor or require one of these word orders. When it
could be ambiguous which noun phrase of a transitive clause is the subject
and which is the direct object, speakers often report that the subject must
precede the direct object: in other words, the word order Predicate Subject
Object is forced. This is probably a strong preference but not an absolute
requirement, since the word order Predicate Object Subject is occasionally
judged to be well-formed. Compare (56a), in which the subject si Carmen
precedes the direct object i lalåhi ‘the men’, with the unexpected (56b).5

This book has taken a long time to complete. That it exists at all is due to the
generosity of many people.
First of all, I want to acknowledge and thank the speakers of Chamorro
who have generously shared their linguistic insights with me over the years.
Manuel F. Borja has been a consultant, collaborator, friend, and member of
the family, both in Saipan and in the U.S. mainland, for almost as long as I
have been studying the Chamorro language. Of the many others who have
been willing to share their judgments and linguistic intuitions with me, I
especially want to recognize Priscilla Anderson, Antonio M. Atalig, Felix P.
Babauta, Jose A. Bermudez, Jesus M. Cruz, Teresina Garrido, Ray Lujan,
Maria T. Quinata, and the late Agnes C. Tabor (in the continental U.S.); and
Dr. Elizabeth D. Rechebei, Francisco Tomokane, the late Anicia Q.
Tomokane, and the late Maria P. Mafnas (in Saipan).
Just as important have been the energy and achievements of the people
in the CNMI who have participated in the project to revise the ChamorroEnglish dictionary. Great thanks and appreciation to the members of the core
dictionary working groups, who include: Daisy A. Quitugua, Magdalena
S.N. Mesngon, and Aniceto H. Mundo (in Rota); Ester Basa, Angelina C.
Fitial, Bertha M. Pangelinan, Arsene M. Borja, Diana H. Borja, Florine M.
Hofschneider, and Leon Masga (in Tinian); as well as Viola S. De Leon
Guerrero, Jose D.L.G. Sanchez, Bernadita P. Sanchez, the late William I.
Macaranas, Frances M. Sablan, Carmen S. Taimanao, Rosalina M. Magofna,
Bernadita P. Sablan, Esther M. San Nicholas, Maggie C. Untalan, Vicente S.
Borja, Rita C. Guerrero, Glenn H. Manglona, Jose Ch. Camacho, Ana C.
Baer, and Elizabeth D.L.G. Concepcion (in Saipan). The editors—Dr.
Elizabeth D. Rechebei, Tita A. Hocog, Manuel F. Borja, and the late Dr.
Rita H. Inos—have been extraordinarily supportive. Liz, in particular, read
and commented on every draft chapter. Her high level of engagement with
this project has been wonderful. Cameron Fruit provided an electronic copy
of Nuebu Testamento at a key moment. Sen dångkulu na si Yu’us ma’åsi’

Work on this grammar has been facilitated from the beginning by the
Chamorro-Carolinian Language Policy Commission of the CNMI and thexviiiNMI Council for the Humanities. I am especially grateful to the present and
past Executive Directors and staff of the CCLPC, especially Melvin O.
Faisao, Cindy P. Reyes, Bernadita P. Sablan, and the late David Omar. I also
want to acknowledge Scott Russell and Paz C. Younis, both formerly of the
Humanities Council, for their assistance. In 2019, I spent several days in
Guam as a consultant on Dr. Robert A. Underwood and Dr. David Ruskin’s
NSF project to document the CHamoru language. Thanks to the Kumision I
Fino’ CHamoru for an enlightening discussion, and especially to Robert and
David for their hospitality.
At UC Santa Cruz, Prof. Matt Wagers has been a great colleague, friend,
collaborator, and active user of the draft chapters of this manuscript. Our
joint research, which has taught me a lot, has been a real pleasure. I owe a
special debt to Scarlett Clothier-Goldschmidt, whose research showed me
how to do electronic corpus research on Chamorro, and to Boris Harizanov,
who designed the search engine and parser for the revised dictionary. Many
thanks to Prof. Jess Law, who generously talked me through my worries
about the meaning of mampus. Many thanks also to Richard Bibbs, Steven
R. Foley, Jed Pizarro-Guevara, Jake W. Vincent, and—much earlier—to
Jeanne D. Gibson, Catherine Crain, and Ann Cooreman for their interest in
Chamorro linguistics.
This material is based on work supported in part by the National Science
Foundation under Grants No. BCS-0753594 to the Northern Mariana Islands
Council of the Humanities (Elizabeth D. Rechebei, PI) and BCS-0753240 to
the University of California, Santa Cruz. It was also supported in part by a
Special Research Grant from the Academic Senate Committee on Research
at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
Finally, all love to Jim, my daughter Anicia, and her partner Steve for
their constant support, patience, and enthusiasm. This book, which is for the
next generations of speakers of Chamorro, is also for them.","[7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22]"

‘As soon as it was getting to be daylight, Tun Akin would take his

that they too are adjuncts that occur at the left edge of the clause.
Cooreman’s (1987) study of transitivity and discourse structure in
Chamorro includes a detailed investigation of the discourse function of inner
topics. She concludes that the use of clauses with an inner topic “reflects the
organization of the narrative at the level of the thematic paragraph” (1987:
208). More specifically, clauses with an inner topic are “mostly used to indicate that the theme has either changed or is temporarily suspended in order
to give background information or...additional comments not necessarily
pertaining to the theme of the present paragraph” (1987: 208). Although
Cooreman’s study is based on narratives recorded in the early 1980’s, it
seems likely that the discourse function of inner topics remains essentially
the same in the Chamorro language today.
26.2.1.2
Inner topics and anaphora
Cooreman (1987) assumes that inner topics are subjects, and clauses with an
inner topic are clauses with the word order Subject Verb Object. However,
there is ample evidence that the inner topic is not itself the subject of the
clause.
First of all, if the inner topic were the subject, it should be realized as an
overt pronoun only when the predicate does not agree with it in person (see
8.4.2). But an inner topic can be an overt pronoun even when the predicate
shows this sort of agreement, as can be seen from the sentences in (9).",[611]

‘The teacher is going to put her things on the shelf.’
These word orders, which are quite common, appear to be neutral from the
standpoint of information structure.
The same word order options are available when one of the predicate’s
arguments is a finite embedded clause or an infinitive clause. Some of the
possibilities are illustrated below, with the finite embedded clause or infinitive clause enclosed in brackets.

Q65Clauses formed from nouns or prepositions differ from clauses formed from
verbs or adjectives in this respect.
The fact that predicates that are nouns or prepositions form a phrase
with their dependents raises the question of whether predicates that are verbs
or adjectives might do the same. Do they combine with their dependents to
form verb phrases and adjective phrases? The coordination patterns described in 19.6 suggest that they do. This means that an account must be
given of the word order options in 3.4.1.1, some of which evidently allow
the subject to come in the middle of a verb phrase or adjective phrase.
3.4.2 Adjuncts
The word order of adjuncts is largely flexible. The most common types of
adjuncts can occur at the left or right edge of the clause, regardless of whether they are realized as adverbs, noun phrases, prepositional phrases, or
adverbial clauses. Except for embedded clauses, many of these adjuncts can
also occur after the predicate (in clauses formed from verbs or adjectives) or
after the predicate phrase (in clauses formed from nouns or prepositions).
Other word orders may be possible as well.
(62) a.","[90, 91]"
"332Other predicates
The extra noun phrase generally does not double a ‘small’ noun phrase
that contains a modifier. But very occasionally, this may be possible; see
(32).
(32)?Håyi gai
ga’ ga’lågu atyu
na puppy?
who? AGR.have pet dog
that
L
puppy
‘Who has that puppy as pet (lit. as a pet dog)?’Finally, the character of the extra noun phrase is affected by the word
order of the subject. When the subject occurs to the left of the complex verb
because it is an inner topic, or has been syntactically focused (as in (31c)) or
questioned (31d), the extra noun phrase can be definite or indefinite, a pronoun or a nonpronoun. But when the subject follows the complex verb, the
extra noun phrase must be indefinite, as in (31b) and (31e). This may be how
the grammar resolves the ambiguity created by the fact that the extra noun
phrase and the subject have the same form: both are noun phrases in the
unmarked case that can be realized as weak pronouns.
14.3.5 Word order
Clauses formed from the verbs of possession have the word order of ordinary intransitive clauses, once it is recognized that their verb is the complex
verb consisting of the verb of possession plus the incorporated noun.
The subject can occur immediately after the complex verb, as in (33).
This means, among other things, that the subject can separate the incorporated noun from the rest of the ‘small’ noun phrase (as in (33b-c)) or from
the extra noun phrase (33d).

DoloresWhat prevents a negative concord item from serving as the subject of a
negative sentence? Recall that the subject is the most prominent constituent
of the clause (see 3.2.1). Further, nothing prevents a negative concord item
from serving as the subject of an embedded clause when sentence negation
is expressed in a higher clause (see (14d) and (14e)). These observations
suggest that in order for a negative concord item to agree with sentence negation, it must be syntactically less prominent than the negation. Suppose
that sentence negation occupies a prominent position in the clause—more
prominent than any of the predicate’s arguments or adjuncts, except the
subject. Then negative concord items that are direct objects, obliques, and so
on will be able to agree with the negation, because they will be syntactically
less prominent than it. Negative concord items in an embedded clause will
likewise be able to agree with the negation in a higher clause. But a negative
concord item that is the subject of the clause containing the negation will be
unable to satisfy this condition, because the subject—as the most prominent
constituent of the clause—will be more prominent than the negation it is
supposed to agree with.4
In generative syntax, prominence is defined in terms of relative height in
constituent structure (c-command). One way of accounting for the distribution of negative concord items in Chamorro is to say that a negative concord
item must agree with a sentence negation that c-commands it. Notice that it
would not work to try to state the condition in terms of word order. This is
because sentence negation is realized to the left of subjects and nonsubjects
alike, and the word order of the subject with respect to other arguments and
adjuncts is flexible (see 3.4 and 4.1).",[405]

Because causative verbs are transitive, they can occur in the passive and the
antipassive, and can be used to derive applicatives and reciprocal verbs.
12.3.3.1
Passives of causatives
The passive of a causative is formed in the usual way, by attaching the infix
-in- or the prefix ma- to the causative verb (see 10.2.2.3 on the choice
between -in- and ma-). Passive clauses differ systematically from transitive
clauses in their realization of the verb’s arguments (see 10.2.2.1). The internal argument—the argument that would be the transitive verb’s direct
object—is realized as the subject of passive, and the external argument—the
argument that would the transitive verb’s subject—is realized as an oblique.
Exactly the same holds true for passive clauses formed from causatives. The
internal argument of the causative verb is realized as the subject of passive;
this is the argument that would have been the subject of the partly inflected
predicate from which the causative is derived. The external argument—the
argument that names the causer—is realized as an oblique.
Consider the sentences in (34), involving the causative verb na’maguf
‘make happy’ (from the adjective maguf ‘happy’). In the transitive clause in
(34a), the causer (‘he’) is realized as the subject, and the internal argument,
which names the one(s) made happy (i mañaina-ña ‘his parents’), is realized
as the direct object. In the passive clause in (34b), the internal argument (i
patgun ‘the child) is realized as the subject, and the causer (i chi’uk gi
cha’guan ‘the dew on the grass’) is realized as an oblique.

‘The child was delighted by the dew on the grass.’ (CD, entry for

Passives of causatives occur very frequently in Chamorro. They can be
formed from the full range of causative verbs, whether the causative itself is
derived from an adjective (as in (34b)), an intransitive verb (35a), a
transitive verb (35b), or an impersonal predicate (35c).

given that the word order of arguments after the predicate is flexible when
the predicate is a verb (see 3.4.1.1).
10.3.2.3
Antipassive clauses in discourse
Antipassive clauses have different functions in discourse from transitive
clauses and passive clauses. To begin with, they occur less often. According
to Cooreman (1987: 58), just 7.7% of the transitive verbs in the Chamorro
narratives she investigated were used to form antipassive clauses. Cooreman
(1987: 72) found that most of these antipassive clauses (61.4%) had an
internal argument that was implicit—not syntactically realized at all, and understood as a nonspecific indefinite. In other words, the typical antipassive
clause in discourse resembles English clauses of the type She’s reading or
They wrote. 6 Cooreman (1987: 69) also found that when the internal
argument was syntactically realized, it was almost always indefinite. She
concluded (1987: 132-135) that the antipassive is used when the activity
described by the predicate is foregrounded and the identity of the internal
argument is unimportant.
The character of the verb’s internal and external arguments has an impact on the choice between a transitive clause and the corresponding antipassive clause. According to Topping and Dungca (1973: 239-241), the
antipassive must be used when the ‘object’ of a transitive verb—that is, the
internal argument—is indefinite. This is clearly a strong preference, but not
an absolute requirement. When the internal argument is indefinite, the clause
can be passive, as can be seen from the following.

An applicative derived from a transitive verb has three arguments. 11.3.2.1
describes how these arguments are realized. 11.3.2.2 briefly mentions the
word order of applicative clauses. 11.3.2.3 discusses how applicatives fare
with respect to antipassive and wh-agreement.
11.3.2.1
Grammatical relations
As expected, applicatives derived from transitive verbs have the same subject as the original verb, but a different direct object. This applicative object
realizes an oblique argument of the original verb, or a new argument that has
been added. The original verb’s internal argument—the argument that would
have been realized as its direct object—is realized as an oblique.7
The same considerations discussed in 11.2.2.1 reveal that the applicative
object is the direct object of the applicative clause. First of all, it has the
form of a direct object. It occurs as a noun phrase in the unmarked case.",[270]

says), and another that names the source of the state (e.g. what is liked) or

the subject, and the second, as the direct object.
The subject and direct object of verbs of this type have essentially the
same profiles as the subject and direct object of ordinary transitive verbs.
The subject is in the unmarked case, and has the word order flexibility
associated with subjects. It can occur immediately after the verb (as in (35c)335and (38a)), at the right edge of the clause (38b), or in other positions (38c-d).

Chamorro allows many semantic classes of adjectives to precede or follow the noun, including adjectives that describe size, shape, age, color, and
nationality. For these adjectives, the choice between the word orders
adjective-noun and noun-adjective appears to be free. Both word orders occur in (41), for instance.

Adverbial clauses introduced by a complementizer seem to have a more
restricted word order than other adjuncts (see 3.4.2 and below). They are
generally found at the right edge of the (higher) clause. Adverbial clauses
introduced by an overt complementizer generally do not occur at the left
edge of the clause, preceding the predicate. But this word order is evidently
possible when the complementizer is omitted before para ‘future, subjunctive’, as in (26).

Finally, the applicative object acts like a direct object for the purposes of
the person-animacy restriction (see 16.2). In Chamorro, a transitive clause
cannot have a direct object that is higher than the subject on the personanimacy hierarchy. This means, among other things, that a clause cannot
have an animate direct object but an inanimate subject, or an animate pronoun as direct object but a nonpronoun as subject.2 Applicative clauses obey
this requirement. The applicative clause in (9) is ungrammatical because the
applicative object is animate (si Carmen) but the subject is inanimate (i katta
‘the letter’). Compare the intransitive clause in (10), which has the same
meaning but is grammatical, because si Carmen is not a direct object, but
rather the object of a preposition.

clause must be specific (see 16.4). When it occurs after the verb, it cannot be
a quantified noun phrase, a general indefinite, or any other nonspecific noun
phrase. Like other direct objects, the direct object of an applicative clause
can a noun phrase of any type: definite or indefinite, quantified or not
quantified, strong or weak. It can also be a finite embedded clause or an
infinitive clause. In (12), the direct object of the applicative malagu’i ‘want’
is an infinitive clause (enclosed in brackets).

Word order

11.2.2.3
Antipassive and wh-agreement
Though applicatives derived from intransitive predicates are transitive, they
differ from other transitive verbs in two curious respects.
(i) Almost every transitive verb in Chamorro has a passive form and an
antipassive form (see Chapter 10). As expected, applicatives derived from
intransitive predicates can occur in the passive. This can be seen from (8)
and the sentences below, in which the passive forms of applicative verbs are
represented in boldface.","[264, 265]"
"29.4Stress and intonation29.4.1 Stress
Chamorro is a language with stress. Each word has one syllable that bears
primary stress (i.e. is louder or more prominent than the other syllables in
the word). This syllable is generally the penultimate (next-to-last) syllable of
the word.
Primary stress is determined differently for roots (unaffixed words) than
for affixed words. A substantial number of roots, most of them borrowed
from Spanish, exceptionally have primary stress on the last syllable.

pl.)’When more than one affix is attached to a root, primary stress is determined by the affix added last. Consider the affixed words á-tatti-yi ‘follow
one another’ and mi-tano’-ña ‘having more land’. Although each word
contains a stressed prefix and a suffix, their order of affixation is different.
The stressed reciprocal prefix á- can be attached to tatti-yi ‘follow’ but not
to tåtti ‘back, behind’. So in á-tatti-yi, the order of affixation must be á[tatti-yi], where á- is the affix added last. Primary stress falls on this prefix:
/ˈatattidzi/. In contrast, the comparative suffix -ña ‘more’ can be attached to
mí-tanu’ ‘having much land’ but not to tånu’ ‘land’. So in mi-tano’-ña, the
10The stressed prefixes include: á- ‘(reciprocal)’, achá- ‘together’, án‘leftover’, chát- ‘barely’, é’- ‘search for’, há- ‘often’, ké’- ‘try to’, lá‘more’, mí- ‘having lots of’, as well as four stressed prefixes that are written
as independent words in the official orthographies: gof ‘very’, sen ‘extremely, most’, gai ‘have’, and tai ‘not have’.
662Sounds and spelling
order of affixation must be [mí-tano’]-ña, where the suffix -ña is the affix
added last. Accordingly, primary stress falls on the penultimate syllable of
the word: /mitaˈnoʔɲa/.
Syllables can also bear secondary stress (marked with ˌ immediately
before the secondarily stressed syllable). In affixed words, secondary stress
falls on the syllable that would bear primary stress in the unaffixed word, as
long as that syllable does not immediately precede the syllable that actually
bears primary stress. See /ˌdeddiˈgo-kku/ ‘my heel’, /ˌpatgun-ˈmidzu/, ‘your
(pl.) child’, but /patˈgon-hu/ ‘my child’. Note that this type of secondary
stress can immediately follow the primary stress. This happens in words
formed with stressed prefixes (e.g. /ˈkeʔ-ˌtuŋuʔ/ ‘try to know’) or words that
have been reduplicated for the progressive aspect (e.g. /ˈdɒˌdaŋkulu/ ‘big
(prog.)’). In addition, secondary stress falls on any syllable that is not next to
any other stressed syllable; e.g. /ˌsiminˈteddzu/ ‘cemetery’, /ˌbilimˈbinis/ ‘star
apple’, /eŋˌkisiˈfwesi/ ‘no matter’, /ˈɒʔpaˌkaʔ/ ‘white’.
29.4.2 Intonation
Chamorro has a typologically unusual correlation between stress and pitch.11
According to previous descriptions (e.g. Costenoble 1940: 12, Topping and
Dungca 1973: 44-46, Chung 1983: 38), primary stress is correlated with low
pitch followed by a rise. (In most languages, primary stress is correlated
with high pitch.) Some preliminary instrumental research on Chamorro pitch
suggests a different characterization: primary stress may be correlated simply with a delayed pitch rise. However it is characterized, one practical consequence of the stress-pitch correlation is that second language learners can
find it hard to reliably identify the location of primary stress.
The stress-pitch correlation in Chamorro exhibits regional variation: it is
different, or holds over a different phonological domain, in the Rota dialect
than in the other dialects. Speakers sometimes characterize the difference by
saying that the Rota dialect has ‘singing’ or ‘sing-song’ intonation. Further
study is needed to elucidate this area of grammar.","[685, 686, 687, 688]"

ADVERBS
Although Chamorro has no productive way of forming
adverbs from other parts of speech, it does have adverbs.
These are diverse in form, meaning, and word order.","[414, 415, 416]"

where?
‘Where are they heading?’Predicates that are verbs or adjectives agree in person and/or number with
their subject. The agreement is sometimes written as a separate word (as in
(1b)), under conditions to be described below (in 2.2.2). No other information about the subject needs to be supplied. The Chamorro language
permits null arguments: the subject, the direct object, and other noun phrases
do not have to appear as separate, pronounced (overt) constituents if their
reference can be determined from context (see 8.4).
Chamorro is a predicate-first language. When arguments do appear as
independent constituents, they follow the predicate.

Perhaps because they show agreement as if they were nouns, the verbs
themselves are morphologically deficient. They rarely, if ever, occur in the
irrealis mood or as infinitives. Unlike other transitive verbs, they have no337passive or antipassive forms, and cannot be used to create applicatives,
reciprocals, or—for most speakers—causatives. They do not show overt
forms of wh-agreement. This profile is more characterisic of nouns than of
verbs. Nonetheless, ya- ‘like’, ilek- ‘say’, and so on cannot be analyzed as
possessed nouns, because they have a direct object, and nouns in Chamorro
do not have direct objects. They also cannot be possessed nouns that exceptionally agree with an argument that is not the subject. The word order
patterns in (38) and the prominence relations illustrated in (41-43) reveal
that despite the exceptional form of the agreement, these verbs agree with
the noun phrase that is their subject.","[362, 363]"
"16.1OverviewAs observed earlier (in 3.2.1), the subject is the most prominent constituent
of the clause. Chamorro has several restrictions that ensure that the subject is
also salient from the perspective of information packaging, meaning that its
linguistic features make it noteworthy, topical, or deserving of attention in
the discourse. At the word level, languages tend to treat animate nouns as
more salient that inanimate nouns, singular nouns as more salient than plural
nouns, pronouns as more salient than nonpronouns, and pronouns that refer
to participants in the speech event (= first and second persons) as more salient than other pronouns (= third person). At the sentence level, languages
tend to treat noun phrases that are syntactic topics as more salient than other
noun phrases. At the discourse level, languages tend to treat noun phrases
that are specific (= refer to particular individuals) as more salient than other
noun phrases. These tendencies come into play in the restrictions described
below, in ways that are familiar from other languages but also unique to
Chamorro grammar.
Two Chamorro restrictions, called the person-animacy restriction and
the third plural restriction, prevent a transitive clause from having a subject
that falls below a certain level of word-level salience. A third restriction
requires subjects that are external arguments to be specific.",[378]

The remaining adverbs have some or all of the word order options described
earlier: at the left edge of the clause, at the right edge of the clause, or
immediately after the predicate. The word order of individual Chamorro
adverbs has not yet been investigated in detail. Nonetheless, an examination
of the CD database suggests that there are adverbs occur only at the left edge
of the clause, as well as adverbs that occur only immediately after the predicate. There are also adverbs occur at one edge of the clause or immediately
after the predicate, and adverbs that occur in all three locations. A very
preliminary attempt is made here to classify some common adverbs in these
terms. Because the classification is based on a limited amount of naturallyoccurring data, it is quite likely that some adverbs have a wider distribution
than is suggested below.
A large number of adverbs occur (only) at the left edge of the clause.
These include many modal adverbs, many degree adverbs, some adverbs
that indicate order in the discourse, and a few adverbs that indicate frequency or location in time.

by adding the suffix -i. This suffix is realized as -yi after a vowel and as -gui

1The suffix -i is realized as -gui after åo (/aw/), in which case the /w/ often
deletes; e.g. essalågui ‘shout to’ (from essalåo ‘shout’). It is also realized as
-gui in a handful of other cases; e.g. chefflågui ‘whistle at’ (from cheffla
‘whistle’), falåggui ‘go and get’ (from falak ‘go to’), fattoigui ‘pay a visit to;
haunt’ (from fåttu ‘arrive’), fo’naigui ‘precede’ (from fo’na ‘before, front’),
and kahulo’gui ‘climb on top of’ (from kahulu’ ‘get up, climb up’).
236Applicatives
subject and another that is realized as an oblique. Applicatives derived from
these predicates have the same arguments, but realize the original oblique
argument as their direct object. Other verbs and adjectives (e.g. chålik
‘laugh’, guput ‘have a party’, liliku’ ‘go in circles’) have just one argument.
Applicatives derived from these predicates have an additional argument that
is realized as their direct object. The meaning of the additional argument is
fixed arbitrarily by the original verb or adjective; e.g. kuentusi means ‘speak
to’, not ‘speak for’ or ‘speak about’, and kihåyi means ‘complain about’, not
‘complain to’ or ‘complain for’.
Very occasionally, an applicative has a more specialized meaning than
the verb or adjective it is derived from. For instance, the applicative håtmi
(from hålum ‘go inside, enter’) means ‘attack, invade’, and the applicative
fattoigui (derived from fåttu ‘arrive’) means ‘visit, haunt’.
Applicatives can be created from a large number of intransitive verbs
and adjectives, including some that are morphologically complex. For
instance, the applicative finu’ Chamorruyi ‘speak Chamorro to’, is derived
from the intransitive verb finu’ Chamorro ‘speak Chamorro’, which is itself
derived from the compound noun finu’ Chamorro ‘Chamorro language’ (by
conversion; see 28.4.9). However, not all intransitive predicates can be used
to create applicatives, and speakers do not always agree about which
applicatives derived from intransitive predicates are words of the language.
(Some speakers recognize e.g. omlati ‘fit into’ and ma’a’ñågui ‘afraid of’ as
Chamorro words, but others do not.) Among the intransitive predicates that
apparently cannot be used to form applicatives are gaigi ‘be at (a place)’,
poddung ‘fall’, and yayas ‘tired’.
11.2.2 Applicative clauses
Generally, a clause constructed from an applicative verb derived from an
intransitive predicate is an ordinary transitive clause with two arguments.
11.2.2.1 discusses the grammatical relations of these clauses. 11.2.2.2 mentions their word order. 11.2.2.3 points out two respects in which applicatives
derived from intransitive predicates differ from other transitive verbs.
11.2.2.1
Grammatical relations
Applicative verbs have the same subject as the verb or adjective from which
they are derived, but a different direct object. When the original predicate is
intransitive, the sense in which the applicative has a different direct object is
that it has a direct object at all. It is transitive, in other words.
It is very clear that applicative clauses in Chamorro are transitive. First
of all, the applicative verb agrees with the subject using forms chosen from237the agreement paradigms for transitive verbs (see 2.2.2.1). These morphemes
are represented in boldface below.

However, argument clauses usually do not serve as objects of prepositions or
as subjects of prepositional phrase predicates (but see 20.5 below).6
In terms of word order, an argument clause follows the predicate it is
associated with. When this predicate is a verb or adjective, the argument
clause is flexibly ordered with respect to the predicate’s other arguments.
The argument clause in (18a) follows the subject, whereas the argument
clause in (18b) precedes the subject.
(18) a.","[463, 464]"
"4.2Tense-aspect-mood markers4.2.1 Form
In Chamorro, the predicate supplies basic information about the tense, aspect, and mood of the clause. Every predicate is marked for neutral versus
progressive aspect; predicates that are verbs or adjectives are also marked
for realis versus irrealis mood (see Chapter 2). The TAM contributes further
information about tense, aspect, and mood. The TAMs include para, which
indicates future or subjunctive mood; ginin, which indicates imperfect tense-aspect; and the modals siña ‘can, possible’ and debi (di) ‘should, ought to’.
Typically, the TAM restricts the mood of the predicate it combines with.
Para and debi (di) combine only with irrealis predicates; ginin combines
only with realis predicates; and siña typically combines with a realis
predicate (but see below and 4.2.2.3). This information is summarized in (2).

irrealisThe assumption here is that the TAM is an optional element of the clause. If
one assumes instead that every clause has a TAM, then Chamorro also has a
TAM that is null (not pronounced) and can combine with realis or irrealis
predicates.
Two TAMs are homophonous with prepositions. The future/subjunctive
para is homophonous with the preposition para ‘to, for’; the imperfect ginin
is homophonous with the preposition ginin ‘from’ (see 5.2).
The other two TAMs can be called auxiliaries, meaning that they have
some but not all of the characteristics of verbs or adjectives.
Siña ‘can, possible’ resembles a verb or adjective in certain respects. It
can combine with the causative prefix na’-, which otherwise attaches only to
verbs or adjectives.

Finally, siña by itself can form a minimal clause. In the most deeply embedded clause of (5) (enclosed in brackets), siña is the only plausible candidate
for the predicate.

UNM(Although the English translation of this example makes use of verb phrase
ellipsis, Chamorro does not have this type of ellipsis. A more accurate translation of minimal clauses like (5) might be ‘(it is) possible’.)
In other respects, siña more closely resembles the TAMs para and
ginin. Like para and ginin, siña does not show agreement with the subject.
And although siña can be immediately followed by the subject, it is more
usual for the subject to come later in the clause, immediately after the (main)
predicate. The more usual word order is consistent with the idea that siña too
is a TAM.1 Compare (4) with (6).

‘The children couldn’t play baseball because there’s no base.’ (CD,

examples of clauses containing siña. Sixty-seven of these had a subject noun
phrase in the vicinity of the predicate. (Clauses with weak pronoun subjects
were excluded, because the placement of weak pronouns is determined phonologically; see 8.3. Clauses that could be analyzed either as passive clauses
with a subject noun phrase, or as transitive clauses with a third personal
plural null pronoun as subject, were excluded when the English translation
was not explicitly passive.) In 19 out of 67 examples, the subject came
immediately after siña; in the remaining 48, the subject came immediately
after the main predicate.
71The upshot is that siña is a predicate, but defective—in other words, it is an
auxiliary.
Debi (di) ‘should, ought to’, the other auxiliary, has the profile of a
TAM in certain respects. Like para and ginin, it cannot combine with the

UNM7.3.6 Summary
Modifiers within the noun phrase can generally precede or follow the head
noun, and their presence causes the head noun to be marked with the linker.
But this broad generalization conceals some systematic differences. The
three types of modifiers have different default word orders. The default for
adjective (phrase) modifiers is to precede the head noun; the default for noun
phrase modifiers and relative clauses is to follow the head noun. Moreover,
not all types of modifiers cause the head noun to be marked with the linker.
The head noun shows this marking when followed by an adjective or noun
phrase modifier, but not when followed by a relative clause.
These differences are summarized below.

noThe chart in (64) reveals that the three types of modifiers are distinct. That in
turn suggests that it would be a mistake to try to collapse them.
To see the point, consider the following hypothetical scenario. Recalling
that relative clauses are embedded clauses, and the predicate of a clause can
be a verb, adjective, or noun, one might conjecture that every modifier within the noun phrase was simply a relative clause. In such a scenario, the
adjective in the noun phrase un dångkulu na kulu’ ‘a big trumpet shell’168More on noun phrases
would be a relative clause whose predicate was an adjective (as in ‘a trumpet
shell that was big’); the noun phrase modifier in kelaguin månnuk ‘chicken
kelaguin’ would be a relative clause whose predicate was a noun (as in
‘kelaguin that was chicken’). What (64) shows is that such a scenario cannot
be right. If all modifiers were just relative clauses, they should have a
uniform word order with respect to the head noun. But every relative clause
can follow the head noun, whereas some types of adjective modifiers cannot.
Moreover, if all modifiers following the head noun were just relative
clauses, their head noun should be marked with the linker in a uniform way.
But the head noun is marked with the post-head form of the linker when the
following modifier is an adjective or noun phrase, but not when it is a
relative clause. In fact, the head noun cannot be marked with the post-head
form of the linker when a relative clause follows (see (65a)); instead, the
relative clause is introduced by the complementizer ni, as in (65b).

‘The farmer planted a lot of sweet potato stems.’ (CD, entry for

internal argument and this argument is definite, most speakers do not use the
antipassive (see 10.3.2.3 and Cooreman 1987: 121-124).
Finally, when a transitive verb has more than two arguments, the verb’s
morphological make-up determines the structure of the corresponding antipassive. There are two patterns:
(i) Chamorro has applicative verbs that are derived by attaching the
suffix -i to a transitive verb (see 11.3.1). One applicative verb of this type is
sangåni ‘say to, tell’, from sångan ‘say’. Applicative verbs of this type have
a third argument that usually names a goal, recipient, or beneficiary and is
realized as their direct object. (The original verb’s internal argument is realized as an oblique.) In the antipassive of an applicative derived with -i, the
additional argument serves as the antipassive oblique. It is almost always
implicit, as in (46) (see 11.3.2.3).
(46)MañangånisiAGR.ANTIP.say.to UNMJuan
JuannamåttusiCOMPAGR.arriveUNMJose.
Jose
‘Juan told (people) that Jose arrived.’
(ii) Chamorro also has concealed applicatives—verbs that lack applicative morphology, but resemble applicatives formed from transitive verbs
in certain other ways (see 11.5). One such concealed applicative is gågåo
‘ask for, request’. Concealed applicatives are verbs of transfer that have
three arguments: an argument that names the one who did the transfer,
another argument that names the recipient, and a third argument that names231what was transferred. The argument that names the recipient is realized as
the direct object. (The argument that names what was transferred is realized
as an oblique.) In (47), for instance, the recipient of the request (si Peling) is
realized as the direct object.
(47)Hu gågåosiPeling salåppi’ para
i gima’.
Peling money for
the house
‘I asked Peling for money for the house.’ (CD, entry for gågåo)AGR request UNMIn the antipassive of a concealed applicative, it is not the recipient, but
rather the object of transfer, that serves as the antipassive oblique. (The
recipient is realized as a noun phrase in the local case or as the object of a
preposition.) Thus, in (48), the object of transfer (kalamendu’ ‘tamarind’) is
the antipassive oblique, and the recipient is realized as a noun phrase in the
local case (gi bisinu ‘at the neighbor’).

‘I asked for tamarind from the neighbor.’ (CD, entry for

10.3.2.2
Word order
Antipassive clauses have the same word order options as other intransitive
clauses. Usually, the subject occurs immediately after the verb, as in (36),
(37), and many other examples cited earlier. The subject can also occur at
the right edge of the clause, as in (49).
(49) a.","[256, 257]"
"8.1OverviewPersonal pronouns are expressions that serve as noun phrases and pick out
different individuals depending on the discourse context. Chamorro has
three sets of personal pronouns: independent pronouns, weak pronouns, and
null pronouns.
All three sets of pronouns are organized along the same lines. Each set
consists of seven pronouns differing in person and number. There are three
persons: first (referring to the speaker), second (referring to the addressee),
and third (referring to individuals other than the speaker and the addressee).
There are two numbers: singular (referring to one individual) and
dual/plural (referring to more than one individual). As in many other
Austronesian languages, the first person dual/plural pronouns—which refer
to the speaker and at least one other individual—distinguish between inclusive and exclusive. Inclusive pronouns refer to the addressee(s) as well as the
speaker; exclusive pronouns do not refer to the addressee(s). The pronouns
do not differ in gender. But in one way or another, they are sensitive to
whether or not the individual(s) referred to are animate (or, perhaps, human).
Finally, the pronouns have both reflexive and nonreflexive uses. The discussion here focuses on nonreflexive uses; the reflexive use is discussed later, in
Chapter 13.
All Chamorro pronouns are noun phrases. The three sets of pronouns
differ in their sound structure, the grammatical relations they can bear, their
possible word orders, and their interaction with agreement.",[198]

from its meaning? Unfortunately, almost nothing is known about how adverbs are ordered relative to one another in Chamorro. But if we focus on the
location of adverbs with respect to the predicate or edges of the clause, some
interesting trends emerge.
Adverbs of direction or location in space occur immediately after the
predicate or at the right edge of the clause.
Manner adverbs generally occur immediately after the predicate, even
when they do not combine with it to form a phonological word. One exception is the adverb chaddik ‘fast’, which has a wider distribution: it can occur
immediately after the predicate or at the right edge of the clause; see (16b)
and (5c).",[429]

AGR beginThese word order options reveal that reduced clauses are not clauses. Instead, both the embedded predicate and the higher predicate belong to the
same clause; that is why the subject can appear after either of them.
(iii) Still more evidence comes from passive clauses. Passive clauses
differ systematically from transitive clauses in the grammatical relations
used to realize the verb’s arguments (see 10.2.2). The internal argument—
the argument that would be the direct object of the transitive clause—is
realized as the subject of the corresponding passive clause, and the external
argument—the argument that would be the subject of the transitive clause—
is realized as an oblique (the passive agent). Compare the transitive clause in
(47a) with the corresponding passive clause in (47b).

"29.6Spelling: the official orthographiesTwo general goals of orthography (spelling systems) are, first, to represent
distinctive sounds simply and accurately and, second, to represent a word
uniformly in all the different environments in which it occurs. These goals
are encapsulated in the slogans ‘one sound, one symbol’ and ‘one word, one
spelling’. The Chamorro sound patterns just described pose a dilemma for
orthographies that aim to meet both goals simultaneously. Consider the roots
/asagwa/ ‘spouse’ and /sajna/ ‘parent’. In order to spell these words as they
sound, their final vowels should be spelled the same, with a, the letter used
to represent the merged low vowel; e.g. asagua and saina. But the final
vowels of these roots contrast in the suffixed forms /asagwɒ-mu/ ‘your (sg.)
spouse’ and /sajna-mu/ ‘your (sg.) parent’. So, in order for each word to
have a uniform spelling wherever it occurs, these vowels should be spelled
with different letters; e.g. asaguå and saina. Neither spelling of /asagwa/ satisfies both orthographic goals. The same point can be made with the roots
/tɒtti/ ‘back, behind’ and /neni/ ‘baby’. To represent these words as they
sound, their final vowels should be spelled with the letter i; e.g. tåtti and
neni. But given that the final vowel of the root is mid in the suffixed form
/tatte-kku/ ‘behind me’, but high in /nini-hu/ ‘my baby’, a spelling that gives
a uniform representation to each word wherever it occurs should spell /tɒtti/
as tåtte but /neni/ as neni. Neither spelling of /tɒtti/ satisfies both goals.
The two official Chamorro orthographies respond differently to this
dilemma. The 2010 CNMI spelling system is a ‘one sound, one symbol’
orthography. It spells words as they sound, even if that means that roots are
spelled differently in the different environments in which they occur. The
2019 Guam spelling system (as well as its earlier versions, going back to
1983) adopts ‘one sound, one symbol’ for the low vowels, but in other
respects it is a ‘one word, one spelling’ orthography. Roots with mid or high
vowels have a uniform spelling in the different environments in which they
occur, even if that spelling does not always correlate transparently with
sound. The details are described for the 2010 CNMI orthography in 29.6.1,
and for the 2019 Guam orthography in 29.6.2.",[696]

ordinary transitive clauses in many respects. 12.3.1 describes how their
arguments are realized. 12.3.2 briefly mentions their word order. 12.3.3
shows that causative verbs can be used to form passives, antipassives, applicatives, and reciprocals. 12.3.4 documents some respects in which causative clauses differ from other transitive clauses. Finally, 12.3.5 raises the
issue of whether causatives might be a type of concealed applicative. The
discussion follows Gibson (1980) in concluding that they are not.
12.3.1 Grammatical relations
A causative verb has the same arguments as the partly inflected predicate
from which it is derived, plus an additional argument. The added argument,270Causatives
which names the causer, is realized as the subject of the causative clause.
The argument that would be the subject of the partly inflected predicate is
realized as the direct object. Any other arguments of the partly inflected
predicate are realized as obliques.
Chamorro grammar provides a wealth of evidence that these are indeed
the grammatical relations of causative clauses. To begin with, the argument
that names the causer is clearly the subject. When this argument is a noun
phrase, it is in the unmarked case (see 5.1.2.1), and the causative verb agrees
with it in person and number (see 2.2.2). The fact that the agreement is
chosen from the paradigms for transitive verbs reveals that causative clauses
are transitive. In (20), the causer and the agreement that cross-references it
are represented in boldface.

Gibson (1980: 37-39) treats applicative clauses in which the direct object realizes the possessor of the oblique as derived by possessor raising. But
even in clauses of this type, the direct object is almost always construed as a
beneficiary (in -i applicatives) or a maleficiary (in -guan applicatives). This
suggests that the applicative object always realizes a goal, recipient, beneficiary, maleficiary, or instrument, and any further relation of possession
between the applicative object and the oblique is merely inferred. This is an
area where further research is needed.
11.3.2.2
Word order
Clauses formed from the applicative verbs described in 11.3.1 have the word
order of transitive clauses with a subject, a direct object, and an oblique (see
3.4.1.1).
11.3.2.3
Antipassive and wh-agreement
As shown earlier (in 11.2.2.3), applicatives derived from intransitive predicates generally do not occur in the antipassive or show the object form of
wh-agreement. Interestingly, applicatives derived from transitive verbs can
occur in both of these constructions.
(i) Applicatives derived from transitive verbs can have both passive
and antipassive forms (see Gibson 1980: 164-166). In this respect, they
behave like ordinary transitive verbs. Some passive clauses that are formed
from applicatives can be seen in (22b), (26), and below.
