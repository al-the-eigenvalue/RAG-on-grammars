daughter2.3 Morphological formation of nouns—nominal derivation
So far I have outlined only simple noun roots. Ilocano has two ways of forming nominals. Any
lexeme in a nominal position (i.e., after an article or demonstrative) functions as a noun:
immay
dagiti immaycame
the ones who camenasingpet
ti nasingpetwell behaved, virtuous
the well-behaved personIlocano also has very productive derivational affixes that may nominalize a root that is
typically not substantival. I will list a few of the most common and useful of these prefixes here.","[47, 48]"
"6.2 Detransitivizing strategies for goal focus verbs
All goal focus (grammatically transitive) verbs in Ilocano can be changed into actor focus
(grammatically intransitive) verbs with detransitivizing affixes. This strategy is employed either
to form the antipassive, whereby an unindividuated patient (grammatical object) is put into the
oblique case and rendered indefinite, or it is used when the verb must be detransitivized as
required by the syntax, as in relative clause formation (see section 13.1). Note the differences
between the following sentences with transitive verbs and their detransitivized counterparts;
Kinnânko ti sabâ.
Nangânak iti sabâ.
Ginatângna ti sida.
Gimmâtang iti sida.",[66]
"THE DICTIONARY
The present dictionary is a culmination of my research as a Ph.D. graduate student and lecturer in
the Department of Linguistics at the University of Califomia-Santa Barbara and a senior
research associate at the Research Centre for Linguistic Typology at the Australian National
University. I began ""collecting"" Ilocano words, however, in the early eighties, reading the
weekly Ilocano magazine, Bannawag, which was often brought home by visiting or migrating
relatives. It was not until my college years at the University of California at Los Angeles that I
was aware that an Ilocano dictionary had been published in 1956 by Morice Vanoverbergh,
which served as a skeleton for the present dictionary.
As any Ilocano can confirm, the Ilocano language is not spoken uniformly in the northern
provinces of Luzon. Regional variations in intonation, grammar, and the lexicon have
necessitated several trips to all the Ilocano speaking regions, which resulted in my meeting many
esteemed Ilocano poets and writers and monolingual Ilocano speakers who served as consultants
for regional and literary vocabulary. Members of the Philippine Information Society in San
Fernando and Bangued, the Superior Court of Laoag, and DZNL radio in San Fernando
graciously volunteered their time to aid me in this respect, providing much encouragement to
complete this project. The Sanglay Law Office of San Fernando, La Union assisted me in many
matters while I was outside the Philippines.
The root-based format of the dictionary matches that of previously published dictionaries
of languages of similar typologies. As the morphology (affix system) in Philippine languages is
rather complex, compiling a nonroot-based dictionary might take the greater part of a lexicographer's life before a good portion of the important words in the language were documented. It
is my belief that a root-based dictionary would be more beneficial to native Ilocanos, students of
Ilocano, linguists, and anthropologists because it allows the users to see affixal permutations and
better understand the essence of the complex morphological system.
The grammatical affixes were put into the dictionary in the same section as lexical roots.
This was done merely for convenience in word searching by the user who is not expected to
determine the morpheme class before looking up each word. It may also be a useful method of
arranging lexicons of languages with highly prefixing typologies such as Ilocano.
Common Ilocano words or bases where the boundary between the root and affix has been
phonetically fused may be found in the dictionary under independent entries to simplify
dictionary searches. For instance, the word sumrek 'to enter' from the root serrek 'enter' may be
found under both entries. Even native Ilocano speakers experience some difficulty determining
the lexical roots in these cases.
A short introduction to Ilocano grammar has been included to outline rudimentary aspects
of Ilocano phonology, morphology, and syntax as an aid to natives and nonnatives alike. As theIntroduction * xiii
short grammar is merely a brief synopsis of the system, it is broken down in terms of
morphological classes, exemplifying paradigms that may aid users of the dictionary in their
lexical searches or in constructing simple sentences. It is by no means to be taken as a thorough
representation of the grammar of the language. Those interested in seeing the most thorough
grammar of the language are encouraged to try to acquire a copy of my Ph.D. dissertation or
Morice Vanoverbergh's 1955 Iloko grammar.
Nonnative Ilocano speakers using this dictionary will find the Affix Cross-Reference List
useful when looking up polymorphemic (derived and inflected) words. It lists the most common
prefixes and all suffixes, infixes, reduplications, and enclitics, which are written in Ilocano
orthography as joined to their roots. Since derivational morphology in Ilocano is extremely
productive, not all derivations are given with each root. I have tried to include the most common
derivational patterns with the most high-frequency roots for users who are not yet familiar with
the morphological system of the language, and also to show that the resulting meanings of many
derived items are not always semantically transparent. The introductory phonology section
outlines the pronunciation of native words and also introduces the user to the basics of Ilocano
phonology, including stress (vowel length), stress shift, morphophonemics, and syllabification.
Stress is shown with each root, but not with the derived forms unless it is idiosyncratic. Tagalog
equivalents are given for many of the entries, as are equivalents in many of the important
languages of Northern Luzon for a large number of basic words to aid comparativists.
As this is the first edition of a root-based dictionary written without financial support for
adequate field editing or typing/research assistance, it fails to be as thorough as I would have
desired. I welcome all comments, criticism, and suggestions, and encourage the users to contact
me regarding the dictionary or any aspect of the Ilocano language they find interesting. It is my
hope that the dictionary can be improved and expanded one day in the future from the comments
of the users so as to be of greater value. I can be reached via electronic mail at
ilocano@philippines.to or through regular mail at the Department of Linguistics, University of
California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106 USA.
Although the Ilocano language is spoken as a lingua franca of Northern Luzon and in
large communities outside the Philippines, it has no official status in the Philippines. No
particular body that I am aware of is presently working to modernize the language or create
materials for its instruction in the Philippines. It is my fervent hope that such a committee will
evolve to research the role of the Ilocano language in the twenty-first century and perhaps decide
how the language can effectively deal with the changing world into the third millennium. If such
a committee were to develop, I would be honored to be able to offer my time, research, and
suggestions to help propel its worthy cause.","[12, 13]"
"The enclitic =(n)sa12 attaches to verb phrases to express uncertainty on behalf of the
speaker. It attaches to the first constituent of the phrase and has two variants =sa after consonants
and =nsa after vowels:
12
Some Ilocano writers prefer to write -sa as a separate word, although its variant -nsa is phonologically
conditioned.",[74]
"1.2 The enclitic absolutive pronouns (=ak series)
The enclitic absolutive pronouns are referred to in the dictionary as the =ak series pronouns to
avoid confusion among many linguistic traditions of naming them (absolutive, nominative,
focus). In this grammar sketch, we will refer to them as absolutives, as they encode both single
arguments of intransitive verbs and patient (object) arguments of transitive verbs, the absolutive
category. As second position enclitics, they usually attach to the first constituent of their phrase.
The absolutive (=ak series) paradigm is as follows:
Independent=ak series pronounEnglish glosssiâk
sikâ
isû, isuna
datâ, sitâ
dakami
datayô

isûda=ak3

lalâkiakboy
I am a boynangân
nangânkaate
you ateIdi napânda idiây Bacnôtan, nagsângitkami.
'When they went to Bacnotan, we cried'.
In negative constructions, the absolutive pronouns encliticize to the negative particle
(saan or di) in the verb phrase, the first constituent of the verb phrase:
Saânda a nangân.
Dida nangân.",[42]
"With locative roots, the prefix pa- also specifies the direction in which an object is transferred for goal focus verbs or the direction in which the actor nominal moves for actor focus verbs.
Impaamiânanmi.
Nagpa-Bauângkami.",[70]
"6. Verbs
An interesting feature about Ilocano (and other Philippine languages) is that every root in the
language that can act as a noun can also be transformed into a verb by means of syntactic placement or verbalizing morphology. Because the initial position is reserved for the predicate, any
noun in that position may take on a predicative function. Conversely, verbs may occur in nominal
functions (after articles or demonstratives). Ilocano does not have a copular (to be) verb:
kayo
Napan.
ti napantree; It is a tree.
He went,
the one who wentdaytoy kayo
Kayo daytoy.this tree
This is a tree.lalaki
Lalaki.boy.
He is a boy.",[60]
"13.3 Adverbial clauses
Adverbial clauses are sentential or phrasal adjuncts. They provide modificatory information that
relates to their main clauses, and they are not required by the syntax of the language. Adverbial
clauses are formed with some type of adverb or overt subordinator that may be followed by a
variety of constituents ranging in form from simple nouns or nominalizations to independent
predicates (finite verbs). Among the various adverbial clause types are the following:
Temporal
Naluton idi sumangpet ti asawana.
Inaramidko sakbay ti panagawidda.",[83]
"Grammar Outline * xliii
1.3 The ergative enclitic pronouns
The ergative enclitic pronouns are used to indicate possession of a nominal (concrete noun or
nominalization) and to indicate the actor of a transitive verb (see section 6). In the body of this
dictionary, they are also referred to as the =ko series pronouns to avoid confusion in the many
linguistic traditions of naming them (actor, nonfocus subject, genitive). As enclitics, they have
the same morpho-syntactic properties as the =ak series pronouns. With verb phrases, they attach
to the first constituent.
The =ko series paradigm is outlined below:
Independent=ko seriesEnglish glosssiak
sikâ
isu, isuna
data
dakami
datayo
dakayo
isuda=ko, =k
=mo, =m
=na
=ta
=mi
=tayô
=yo
=damy
your
his, her
our (dual, inclusive)
our (exclusive)
our (inclusive)
your (plural); your (polite)
theirThe first and second person singular pronouns have two forms =ko, =k\ and =mo, =m,
respectively. The forms =k and =m are used after vowels and fuse with the suffixes =en or -an
where the final -n of the suffix is lost, making these pronouns more like affixes than clitics:
balayko
pusam
inumek
Intedko kenkuana.my house (f. balay 'house')
your cat (f. pusa 'cat')
I (will) drink something, (f. inumen 'to drink something')
I gave it to him.","[42, 43]"
"12. The Ligature (ng)a
The ligature (or linker) is a connective particle used in Philippine languages to connect various
syntactic parts of a sentence (heads and attributes). The Ilocano ligature has two written variants:
nga before vowels and a before consonants. However, in speaking, the ligature nga is usually
preferred regardless of phonetic environment.
Among the many uses of the ligature are the following: connect adjectives and nouns,
introduce complements or appositional constituents of all syntactic categories, separate the
negative particle saan from the verb in negative declarations, and separate repeated words in
emphatic constructions:
Sao a sao ni Kondring.
naimas a digo
Saankami a napan.
Nalaka a daiten.
ti kabsatko a lalaki
ti nuang a napigsaKondring is always talking.
delicious broth
We didn't go.
It is easy to sew it.
my brother
the strong water buffaloWhen the ligature (ng)a joins non-predicative syntactic elements, notice that the two
conjoined constituents do not predicate:
Naimas ti bibingka.
naimas a bibingkaThe rice cake is delicious,
delicious rice cakeNi Erlinda ti maestra.
ni Erlinda a maestraErlinda is the teacher.
Erlinda, the teacherGrammar Outline * lxxxi13. Clause Combining
Various processes are involved when Ilocano clauses are combined. In certain combinations, one
clause becomes a well-integrated (dependent) constituent of another. These include relative
clauses and complement clauses. Clauses may also combine where neither is the superordinate
clause; both may function independently. Such is the case with coordinate clauses. This section
will discuss the following clause types:
13.1
13.2
13.3
13.4Relative clauses
Complement clauses
Adverbial clauses
Coordination13.1 Relative clauses
A relative clause is a clause that modifies the head of the noun phrase (NP) to which it belongs; it
'relates' a piece of information to its head noun. Relative clauses are linked to their head noun in
Ilocano with the ligature (ng)a: NP = head noun + ligature (ng)a + relative clause.
ti tao a manakem
ti balasang nga agur-uray kaniak
ti al-alia a nakitanathe man that is wise
the maiden who is waiting for me
the ghost that he sawThe head noun taking a relative clause must be in the absolutive position with respect to
the predicate of the relative clause. A head noun that functions as an actor will take an actor
focus verb, a head noun that functions as a patient will take a patient focus verb, etc.
ti tao a nagsurat
ti mannala a sinuratanna
ti sarsuela a sinuratna
ti nagan nga insuratna
ti ubing a nagsangit
ti balasang a nakitak
ti al-alia a nakakita kaniak
ti tukak nga innalada
diay babai a kinasaok13.2the man who wrote (actor)
the dancer to whom he wrote (direction)
the opera he wrote (patient)
the name he wrote down (theme)
the child who cried (actor)
the maiden I saw (nonactor)
the ghost that saw me (actor)
the frog that they got (patient)
the girl with whom I spoke (comitative)Complement clausesComplement clauses are those that can be considered as embedded arguments of a matrix
predicate. Most complement clauses have the potential to stand alone as a complete phrase,
except those that are 'reduced', sharing a co-referential argument with the matrix clause that is
only overtly expressed in the matrix clause.
Kayatko nga agawidka.
Kayatko ti agawid.","[80, 81]"
"Intransitive verbs may take an indefinite notional patient or object in the oblique case.
Nangának iti dinadaráan.
Nangán ti babai iti pariá.",[52]
"6.1 The categories of verbs
6.1.2 Focus (verbal orientation) and transitivity
One notable distinction present in every affixed verb is the encoding of what has been termed
'focus' in Philippine linguistics, referring to formal marking that reflects the privileged syntactic
status of the absolutive noun phrase. Ilocano verbs assign 'focus' to their absolutive nominal
(=ak pronoun NP), the nominal in the most syntactically privileged position in terms of the
semantic and grammatical relationship the nominal has with the verb. Simple intransitive verbs
such as ag-, -um- and mang- verbs, for instance, take at most one core nominal as the argument
whose semantic relationship to the verb is usually 'actor' or single-argument 'experiencer'.
Nagsangit ti balasang.
Timmugawda.
Nangankamin.
Agap-apada.
Ngimmisitdan.",[61]
"Benefactive focus
The absolutive argument of benefactive verbs is usually the beneficiary of an action, but in some
cases the person encoded in the absolutive case can be seen as having the action of the verb done
in his/her place rather than for his/her benefit. It is formed with the circumfix i- -an (past: in -an),
morphologically a combination of a theme prefix and a directional suffix.

'If you want to eat already, say so and I'll set the table for you'InstrumentalfocusThe instrumental focus places the instrument or tool used to carry out the action in the absolutive
case. It is formed by the prefix pag- (past: pinag). Because of the semantic and pragmatic nature
of this particular focus, derived pag- words usually appear in discourse as non-predicative nouns.

Special thanks are due to four people who have reviewed the first manuscript of my dictionary and
have subsequently helped me with my linguistic research and travels in the Philippines every year
since. They are Mrs. Josefa Mallare Galvez, Dra. Geraldine Galvez, Mrs. Maria Roldan, and Mrs.
Elizabeth Tadina of San Fernando, La Union. I would also like to thank my parents, Florence
Konvalinka, Carmen, Edwin, Benedict, and Carol Villanueva, Melissa Deleissegues, and Alex
Gonzales for their support and encouragement in all my work. Thanks to the faculty and graduate
students of the Department of Linguistics at the University of California-Santa Barbara for all the
wonderful times and to the Linguistics faculty and graduate students of the Australian National
University. I also greatly appreciate the efforts of the Sanglay Law Office in San Fernando, La
Union, Galvez Clinic, Cristy Boija, DZNL radio, Liw Agbayani, APGSA Santa Barbara, and the
Superior Court of Laoag for accommodating my research with such warm hospitality. Atty. Aurora
Sanglay and Dr. Imelda Quilala graciously supplied me with Bannawag magazines for which I am
most grateful. I must also express my deep gratitude to some Ilocano writers and pressmen for their
gracious help with my inquiries: Roy V. Aragon, Dr. Godofredo Reyes, Ramon Pagatpatan,
Prescillano Bermudez, Lorenzo Tabin, Elnora Manangan, Severino A. Pablo, Pelagio Alcantara,
Ethelwaldo Madamba, D. Nicasio Asuncion, and Redentor Santos. They are, of course, not
responsible for any shortcomings in the manuscript. In preparing this dictionary, I have read the
works of hundreds of Ilocano writers from different regions in order to collect the sample of words
in this present volume. I cannot thank them all personally, but I wish them continued success in
propagating the beauty of the Ilocano language through literature. Maraming salamat to Kenneth
Chang and Nick Kibre for their computer help. I am also very grateful to all the linguists who have
commented on my work in linguistics, especially to my mentor Marianne Mithun, Laurie Reid,
Nikolaus Himmelman, Andy and Medina Pawley, Wallace Chafe, Steven Fincke, Susanna
Cumming, Sandra Thompson, Byron Bender, Bob Dixon, Sasha Aikhenvald, Geoff Haig, Alec
Coupe, Agnes Kang, Tony Davis, Peter Fitzgerald, and to the Ilokano department in Hawai'i: Josie
Paz Clausen and Precy Espiritu. I would like to thank Mrs. Hilda Manansala for allowing me to use
the Market scene painting on the cover of this book. Maria Victoria Herrera was extremely helpful
in contacting the members of the Philippine art community for me. In closing, I would like to give
special thanks to my family in America and the Philippines (the Rubinos, Galvezes, Villanuevas,
Konvalinkas, Carbonells, and Lita Aquino) and to Maria Gracia Tan Llenado for their untiring
support and understanding of my work in lexicography and linguistics.","[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]"
"Theme focus
The prefix i- forms theme focus verbs, putting the 'theme' in absolutive position. The theme is
the entity whose location is at issue (Foley and Van Valin 1984:51). Absolutive arguments of
theme focus verbs are typically objects that are transferred, implemented, or affected (physically
or psychologically) by means expressed in the root. Among the major verbs in this focus category
are:

"A Note on the Orthography
In orthographic systems that have been used to write Ilocano since the 1600s, two systems have
predominated. The older system is based on Spanish orthography and the newer system is the
standardized alphabet accepted for the Tagalog language, as used in the weekly Ilocano
magazine, Bannawag. The orthography is mostly phonemically based for the consonants, but not
for the vowels. Among the five vowels (a, e, i, o, u) used in Ilocano writing, the letter e
corresponds to two separate phonemes in the southern dialects, a mid front vowel, and a high
back unrounded vowel. The orthographic symbols o and u originally represented one phoneme
with alternative pronunciations in specific environments (o word-finally). Due to the large
number of foreign loans in the language and high degree of bilingualism, however, these letters
now represent two contrastive vowel sounds, e.g. oso 'bear' vs. uso 'use, in fashion'.",[13]

"Grammar Outline * lxi
There are numerous morphological affixes that combine with roots to give them verblike
qualities (i.e., aspect [tense], mode, volition, transitivity). Words with these particular
morphemes will be considered 'verbs' in this grammar sketch, forming a separate lexical class
from nouns.","[60, 61]"

to a front, central lax vowel [e] similar to the e in pet.
In the southern dialects, the letter 'e' represents two separate vowel sounds. In Spanish
loanwords, it is equivalent to the northern pronunciation. In native words, however, it is pronounced
as a high to high-mid, centralized back unrounded vowel [ui] that does not occur in word-final
position.

they were both represented by one character (or by a small dot underneath the syllabic character
corresponding to their consonantal onset). After the arrival of the Spaniards and the incorporation
of many Spanish loanwords in Ilocano vocabulary, native Ilocanos were able to distinguish these
vowels and chose to do so in subsequent orthographic practice. The [o] vowel is a rounded upper
mid vowel similar to the Spanish o in no, while the [u] vowel is a rounded high back vowel similar
to the Spanish u in azul with a more lax interpretation in unstressed environments.
Word-finally, lui is realized as [o], while in word-medial positions and stressed environments, as [u]. In Spanish loanwords, the Spanish pronunciation is retained for these vowels.

vowel is preceded by two consonants or a consonant followed by a glottal stop (written
in Ilocano

Each root carries an underlying stress on the penult or final syllable. The placement of the stress may
shift to the following syllable under the following conditions:
a. For stems ending in a consonant or the vowel a, the stress shifts one syllable to the right with
suffixation (the -en or -an suffixes). The stress does not shift one syllable to the right if the stressed
vowel of the root is preceded by two different consonants, a consonant and a glide (vowel i, u, or o
+ another vowel), or a consonant followed by a glottal stop:

The stress may shift one syllable to the left under the following conditions:
a. Certain kinship terms that refer to specific relatives (related to the speaker or addressee) such as
ama 'father', ina 'mother', and apo 'grandparent' shift their stress one syllable to the left following
the personal article ni or any of its variants {ken, kada, or da):

Consonant gemination in Ilocano occurs both in root words and as a result of productive derivational
affixation. A l l Ilocano consonants may be geminated (except the glottal fricative). In many roots,
consonants are underlyingly geminate.

T h e glottal stop m a y o c c u r in syllable-initial position or in onset position word-medially. A s a
variant o f k or t before another consonant, the glottal stop m a y also appear in coda position. U n l i k e
in T a g a l o g , there is no word-final glottal stop. In the orthography, word-initial glottal stop is never
written, and word-medial glottal stop after a consonant is written with a hyphen.
A s all syllables in Docano must have a consonantal onset, words that orthographically begin
with a vowel are actually articulated with an initial glottal stop ( S e e also section 6 ) .
aso[?a:.so]dogita[?i.ta]nowliken[?u:.kuin]puppyOrthographic double vowels are articulated with an intervening glottal stop, as all syllables
take a consonantal onset. In rapid speech, this m a y reduce to a mere audible syllable break.

following affixation of maN-/paN- + CV-: Mannaray < *mananaray\pammati < *panamati (Lawrence Reid, p.c.).",[35]
"Certain affixes, however, such as -en and -an, encode transitive frames that may assign
two nominals in core case, an agent (actor) encoded in the ergative case, and a nonactor (patient,
location, recipient, benefactor, reason, or theme, etc.) encoded in the absolutive case. Since the
absolutive argument in focus for these verbs is a nonagent/actor, they are called ""goal focus
verbs"". Because these verbs can take two core nominals, they are grammatically transitive.

This grammar outline is aimed primarily at introducing the fundamentals of Ilocano word
formation that may assist readers in using this dictionary. 1 I will break up the grammar outline
into grammatical classes and discuss morphological forms. For a more complete treatment of Ilocano morphology and a discussion of issues in Ilocano syntax, please see Rubino (1997).
SYNOPSIS FOR LINGUISTS: Ilocano, like its sister Philippine languages, is a predicate-initial
language with a complex, head-marking, highly-prefixing morphology. Affixes denote a wide
range of grammatical categories including aspect, focus, number, volition, transitivity, reciprocity, and some lexical categories such as pretense, smell, and relative size. Noun phrases may
function as predicates and arguments. As arguments, they are usually preceded by noun markers
(articles or demonstratives) that inflect for case (core vs. oblique), number (singular vs. plural),
and time. Articles also inflect for reference (common vs. personal). Pronouns inflect for person,
number, and case (ergative, absolutive, and oblique). There is an inclusive/exclusive distinction
in the first person plural forms. When core (non-oblique) pronouns are used with predicates, they
are enclitic. There is a pervasive particle (nga/a) used to link related constituents (heads and
attributes) called a ligature (§12), and a number of uninfecting adverbial particles (§7.2). All
roots (non-p/articles) may be nominalized or verbalized by morphology or syntactic function.","[35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41]"
"2.2 Gender of nouns
Ilocano has no grammatical gender. However, many Spanish loanwords have been introduced
into the language that typically end in -a to indicate feminine gender: 7

Successful word searching in a root-based dictionary of a morphologically complex language
such as Ilocano requires the ability to separate the root m o r p h e m e from the affixes. Native
speakers of Ilocano and trained linguists are usually able to do this quite easily in most cases, butIntroduction * xviifor students o f the language, this cross-reference list may prove most helpful. T h e affixes
alphabetized below are separated by category: prefixes, infixes, suffixes, and enclitics (which are
written in Ilocano orthography as suffixes). Users of the dictionary must also keep in mind that
many o f these affixes may be used with root reduplication of various types:Reduplication Patterns 1 in Ilocano

Transitive verbs, on the other hand, take two core arguments. When encoding two
arguments by enclitic pronouns, the actor of the action is encoded by the =ko series pronouns
(ergative case), while the non-actor takes absolutive case (=ak series pronouns). All noun phrases
in these cases are given core case marking; all other nouns are peripheral and encoded in the
oblique.

"Patient focus
Patient focus verbs take an argument in the absolutive case whose semantic role with respect to
the verb is that of a 'patient' (an affected entity or target of the action of the verb). The patient
focus suffix is -en (perfective -in-). The suffix -en typically forms transitive verbs in which the
absolutive argument is directly affected by a volitional actor.

'What did you eat?' (Perfective form of kaneri)DirectionalfocusThe directional focus is formed with the suffix -an. It indicates that the absolutive argument is a
locative of some kind or some kind of partially affected patient. The suffix -an may also be used
with certain verbs to indicate addition or removal. It is used with many roots to indicate a human
patient in the case frame, i.e., takawen 'to steal something' vs. takawan 'to rob someone'. The
morphological cover term directional focus is reserved for the -an verb class, not because of the
semantic properties shared by all the members of the class, but due to certain semantic changes
that may indicate the direction or location of an action with a number of roots, i.e., sagaden 'to
sweep (dirt)' vs. sagadan 'to sweep (the floor)'.

Actor focus
Actor focus verbs take at most one core argument in the absolutive case whose relationship to the
verb is that of 'actor' (semantic agent or experiencer). Actor focus verbs may be formed with the
prefixes ag- (durative), ma-lmaka- (stative or potentive), or the infix -um- (punctual or
inchoative). Transitive verbs may be detransitivized with mang- (distributive).

"BilabialstopsThe bilabial stops are /p/ (voiceless) and /b/ (voiced). They are unaspirated.
*Note: In the three columns below, the first column shows segments as they are spelled in Ilocano,
and the second column reflects the pronunciation in simplified IPA. The IPA pronunciation reflects
the dialect spoken in San Fernando, La Union, Philippines. In the northern dialects of Ilocos Norte
and Ilocos Sur, the high back unrounded vowel [ui] is pronounced as a mid front vowel [e],

The velar stops in Ilocano are /k/ (voiceless) and /g/ (voiced). They are never aspirated, and in final
position are usually unreleased. The voiceless stop / k j often fricates to /k""/ between vowels, or is
pronounced as a glottal stop [?] before consonants:

1.2 The fricatives
Ilocano has one native voiceless alveolar fricative [s], and a nonnative glottal fricative [h]. The
voiceless alveolar fricative is pronounced like the s in soda. Like the stops, it may geminate:
malas
susay
assawa
suso[ma:.las]
[su:.say]
[?as.sa:.wa]

palatalizes to [J]:

I
issueThe glottal fricative [h] is not native to the Ilocano language and does not geminate. It often
appears in borrowings from languages like Spanish, English, Chinese, or Tagalog. The only native
word with a glottal fricative is haan 'no', a spoken variant of saan.

[?e:.he]
[hu:.si]no
axle (f. Spanish)

Although there are no contrastive affricate consonants in Docano, affricates do occur in the language
as a result of palatalization in certain phonological environments or in foreign language borrowings.
The voiced alveo-palatal afficate [d3], like the English j in juice, is represented in the
orthography by dy or di + a vowel.

[tjaij.gi]chocolate (f. Spanish)
pickles (f. Malay)

before the glide y or its equivalent (vowel i followed by another vowel).

1.4 The liquids
Ilocano has two liquid consonants, M and IV. ftl is pronounced as a dental lateral in all environments.
It does not have a velarized variant like the English '1' in syllable-final position.

Ilocano has two glides, /w/ and lyl. For their use in diphthongal codas, see section 2.1.
The labio-velar glide /w/ is formed with rounded lips and some obstruction at the velar part
of the mouth.

Ilocano has three nasal consonants, differentiated by the place of articulation in which the oral
airstream is blocked. The three nasals in Ilocano are /m/, /n/, and /ng/.
The bilabial nasal /m/ is formed by closing the airstream at the lips. It is equivalent to the
English m in mother.

Spanish n in no.","[23, 24, 25, 26]"
"xlvi * Grammar Outline
2.1 Plural of nouns
Nouns are usually pluralized simply by introducing them with the appropriate plural form of the
article or demonstrative. 6
To emphasize plurality or distributiveness, however, nouns may be pluralized by CVC
(consonant-vowel-consonant) reduplication of the initial sound sequence of the root, e.g. sabsabong 'flowers (each individual flower; several flowers, different varieties of flowers; flowers
here and there)', balbalay 'houses', tugtugaw 'chairs', puspuso 'hearts', bakbakes 'monkeys'.
Nouns beginning with vowels are articulated with an initial glottal stop, since no Ilocano
word may begin phonetically with a vowel. These nouns are pluralized by reduplicating the
initial glottal stop, vowel, and following consonant of the root. Ilocano orthography does not
represent the initial glottal stop; it is represented word-internally with a hyphen.
aso [?a:.so]
as-aso [?as.?a:.so]dog
dogsNouns that begin with a CVV (consonant-vowel-vowel) sequence form their plural by
reduplicating the initial consonant and vowel of the root. The plural form thus begins with an
open syllable with a long vowel:
nuang
nunuang [nu:.nuang]water buffalo
water buffalosMany kin terms and proper nouns (nouns taking the article ni) form their plural simply by
reduplicating the initial CV (consonant-vowel) of the root, resulting in an open initial syllable.

ii- -anmangmangmangimangi-instrumental
comitativePagka- (comitative)*agka- (mutual); *maki- (social)6.3 Aspect
Ilocano verbs inflect for a number of aspectual distinctions: The perfective (completive) aspect is
used for actions that are initiated and completed; the continuous aspect denotes continuous,
repetitive, or habitual actions; and the future aspect is used for actions that have yet to be
initiated. The unmarked infinitive form of the verb does not specify whether an action has been
initiated or completed.
The perfective aspect is formed with a prefix (or infix) as shown below. The continuous
aspect is formed by initial CVC reduplication of the stem, 9 and the future is formed by the adverbial clitic =to after consonants and =nto after vowels.
9Stems in Ilocano may be polymorphemic, as opposed to roots. Examples of reduplicated stems are:ma-turog'sleep' > mat-maturog 'sleeping', pa-sikal 'labor pains' > ag-pas-pa-sikal 'suffer labor pains', mangan /maN-kaan/'eat' > mang-mangan 'eating'.",[66]
"6.7 Social verbs
The prefix maki- (transitive ka-) is used to form social verbs. Social verbs are used to indicate
shared participation of an action (actions performed in the company of other people) or verbs
used to ask permission to perform an action that is usually comitative.
Inkayo makiapit.
Intan makisala.
Makiinumak man?
Makisindfkami man?
Mabalin ti makikatugaw?
Nakitinnulagda idi kalman.",[71]
"1.4 The oblique pronouns
The oblique pronouns are formed by adding the enclitic ergative (=ko series) pronouns to the
stem kania- or with the personal oblique articles ken (singular) or kada (plural).

differentiate personal nouns (names, vocatives, etc.) from non-personal nouns as shown in the
following paradigm:

PluralThe core and oblique distinction in Ilocano can be summarized in the following way.
Core nouns may be morphological arguments of verbs. They may be replaced by an enclitic
pronoun of either the =ko or =ak series. Oblique nouns, however, are not verbal arguments in
that they cannot be replaced by enclitic pronouns, although they may play an essential role in the
semantic frame of a verb.
Grammatically intransitive verbs in Ilocano may take one enclitic pronoun in the =ak
series. When this particular argument appears as a full noun phrase, it takes core case marking:

Nangának.
Nangán ti babài.

"INTRODUCTION
Ilocano is a Western Austronesian language spoken by about nine million people in Northern
Luzon, Philippines. It is the most widely spoken Philippine Cordilleran language, and constitutes
its own branch within the Cordilleran language family as indicated in the following genetic
reconstruction by Lawrence Reid (1989:57):CORDILLERAN LANGUAGESCordilleranKey to Cordilleran Languages: AltN Northern Alta; AltS Southern Alta; Blw Balangaw; Bon Bontok;

"Many verbs denoting natural phenomena do not take formal arguments in Ilocano but
they are classified as actor focus verbs because they do not vary in form.

"11. Negation
Ilocano has two negative adverbs used to negate clauses or constituents: saan (dialectal variant:
haan) and di. With declarative sentences lacking enclitic pronouns, the negative counterparts are
formed by the negative adverb saan or di preceding the full declaration. With the adverb saan,
the declaration must be joined with the ligature (ng)a; no ligature is required with di. Saan is
preferred to di when negating noun phrases.
Nagallikûbeng ti angin.
Saân a nagallikûbeng ti angin.
Di nagallibkübeng ti angin.",[79]
"During early Spanish contact, the Ilocano-speaking areas were confined to the provinces
of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Abra, and La Union, but the Ilocano people have populated many
other areas in the Philippines and even predominate in many areas of the provinces of
Pangasinan, Benguet, and Tarlac. There are also sizable communities in many other Philippine
provinces and the islands of Mindoro and Mindanao. Because the original Ilocano region borders
the mountainous interior of Luzon, where members of linguistic minority groups prevail, Ilocano
has been used for centuries as the lingua franca of the region and in legal documents andxii * Introduction
proceedings of the various mountain peoples. Many of these ethnic groups still use Ilocano today
to communicate among themselves, despite the fact that Tagalog has been declared the national
language of the Philippines.
Ilocanos are the most migratory of the Philippine ethnic groups. They have settled in
many other parts of the world, forming sizeable communities in Brunei, Singapore, Hong Kong,
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and most urban centers in the United States, Canada, and western Europe.
The largest concentrations of Ilocanos in the United States are in California, Alaska, and
especially Hawai'i, where nearly one-fifth of the total population can claim Ilocano descent
(Espiritu 1977; Foronda 1978). In Hawai'i, Ilocano has been taught in the schools in bilingual
education programs as the medium of instruction and in universities as a foreign language.","[11, 12]"
"The prefix ma- (perfective form na-) is also used to form involuntary or stative verbs (and
adjectives) that take only one core argument in the absolutive case.
maldaang
maüyong
malmes
/natnägto be sad
to be crazy
to drown
to fallWith the suffix -an, the prefix ma- indicates nonvolitional or abilitative agency. The
resulting verbs can be intransitive resultatives (in many cases where the agent is expressed in the
root) or transitive potentives, where the agent is expressed in the ergative case.
Intransitive verbs:
marabiiyan
mapudotan
maatälan
magasängan
iVaatälanak idi kalmän.
Afagasänganak.to be overtaken by the night
to be warmed up
to be run over
to be affected by spice
I was run over yesterday.
I was affected by the spice.",[65]
"6.3.5 Immediacy with apagThe prefix apag- is used to indicate immediate fulfillment of an action or state. When denoting
the English concept as soon as, the actor is encoded in the ergative case. With stative roots, it
may indicate a state not fully attained.

caused to be done, not directly done by the actor. The causative morpheme in Ilocano is pa- and
is used with the verbal affixes as exemplified in the following chart.

combined by simple intonational breaks or with coordinating conjunctions, of which Ilocano has
three: ken 'and', ngem 'but', or wenno 'or'.
Coordination with no overt coordinator:

"Gemination may also transcend prefix boundaries, where the coda consonant of the prefix
matches the onset consonant of the root or following prefix.
Naggatangam?/nag-gatang-an=mo/'Where did you buy it?'

"Grammar Outline * lxxxiii
Nga complementation, in which the complement clause is preceded by the ligature nga, is
the most versatile of complementation types. Both the verbs of the main clause and complement
clause can be personal or impersonal, transitive or intransitive. There are no restrictions on the
grammatical role of the co-referential argument in the main clause. That is, the co-referential
argument may function as either an ergative or an absolutive argument of the matrix predicate.
Impersonal main predicates:
Naskén nga aginanákayo.
Masápul a mabuniáganka itan.
Pudnó nga ay-ayaténka.
Nabayágen a birbirókenka.
