WORD ORDERIngush is a consistently head-final language except for predominantly verb-second order
in main clauses. Verb-second order is much like that of Germanic languages in that the finite
verb is clause-second but its preverb, including prefixes, is clause-final. Nearly all phrases
and non-main clauses are head-final. In addition to verb-second order in main clauses there
are other, often pragmatically determined but always grammatically defined, word orders that
place elements in clause-initial or clause-final position or postpose modifiers of nouns. These
departures respond to such factors as chaining, interrogative words, topicalization, and focus.
Impressionistically, Ingush word-order changes are similar to those of Russian in some of
their pragmatic effects and in their frequency and variety, but they are unlike those of Russian
in the extent to which word order possibilities are are defined by syntactic boundaries.","[691, 692]"

If it's all right with you ('if you'll permit') I'll go ('I'd go'), he said. (0408)30.2.2. Ordering of arguments and adjuncts.
The grammatically most basic order of
arguments is SV, AOV, AGTV (where G = the more goal-like argument and T = the more
theme-like argument of ditransitives: see §21.1). First elements of compound verbs and
heavy pieces of light verb constructions occupy the O or T slot. Examples showing this basic
order are (27)-(33) above and many others. This order is not rigid, and the arguments can
have different orders relative to each other and (in main clauses) to the verb.
For non-arguments the preferred order is basically consistent with what is described for
adverbs by Cinque 1999 and Frey 2003. The order is not rigid, and it is not affected by
whether the non-argument is a single word, a phrase, or a converb clause. The major types
tend to occur in the following order, from clause-initial to immediate preverbal:
Sentence adjuncts, e.g. evaluative ('fortunately'), attitudinal ('admittedly'), modal
('probably', 'perhaps'), are most often clause- or sentence-initial: (48), also (83)-(85) below.

Event-related adjuncts (time, place, reason, words like 'typically', 'often', 'always', etc.
usually precede all arguments: e.g. (34) above (time adjunct clause) and examples in
§§13.9.2 and 22.2. In (49) a time adverb precedes another circumstantial, followed by a
degree adverb.

30.4.2. Argument focus. Most often the focal nominal or NP is clause-initial and the verb (or
the finite auxiliary of a verb in a compound tense) follows immediately after it. The
postverbal elements then follow in their usual order (subject, indirect object, direct object),
followed by the nonfinite part of a compound tense. The appearance of the verb in the
position after this nominal is unlike any other word-order process in Ingush in that it is just
the conjugated verb form – the finite auxiliary of a verb in a compound tense, or the shorn
stem of a prefixed verb – that is moved; the rest (the prefixes, the nonfinite part of an analytic30. Word order687tense form) remains at the end of the sentence. Enclitics that can attach only to the verb,
however, stay with the conjugated form. A parenthetical word is discounted in figuring
second position.
In the following examples the second-position finite verb form is boldface. (104)-(105)
have a simple verb following a one-word focal NP. Another example is (55 = 61) above.
Content questions (§30.3.1 above) are also examples of argument focus.

"30.2. Clauses
Ingush uses verb-final order in non-main and some main clauses, and verb-second order
in most main clauses. In compound verbs, analytic tense forms, and constructions with
modals and the like, it is the light or auxiliary verb that is final in verb-final order or clausesecond in verb-second order.
30.2.1. Verb-final order.
Verb-final order, usually AOV and SV, can be found in
pragmatically neutral main clauses including elicited simple sentences with no context:

"21. Valence, argument structure, and alignment479Not all speakers are able to distinguish or comment on these meaning differences. A Google
search for "" "" (dieza aaz, with ergative) and "" "" (dieza sy, with genitive) and
analogous constructions with other pronouns showed that they have similar frequencies, with
ergative slightly predominating.
(74)-(75) are an elicited minimal pair for 'can, may'.166 Case attraction:167
166The forms meg and mog differ in ablaut, i.e. in conjugation class. There is no other pair of
Ingush verbs that differs in only this way, so it is not a straightforward matter to say whether these
are inflectional variants of the same verb or different verbs. I assume their different valence
patterns suffice to make them different verbs. Kibrik 1981:36 (2003:624-625) shows that the Tsez
verb with meanings similar to meg takes either case attraction or case assignment. (The Ingush
and Tsez verbs are not cognate.)
167
Other languages of the north Caucasus have a similar opposition of case attraction and case
assignment with modals and the like, and the literature (Forker 2010, Matasovi 2009, Kibrik
1981:36 [2003:624-625], Polinsky & Potsdam 2002, Haspelmath 1996:178-9, Harris 1995; Harris
& Campbell 1995:187-9 for progressive tenses) shows that (in languages where enough testing has
been done, chiefly Daghestanian languages) there is a syntactic difference between the two
constructions: the one with case attraction is monoclausal, so that a single surface predicate assigns
the case, while that with non-attraction is a biclausal construction with the finite auxiliary
assigning case to its subject and the subject of the infinitive non-overt because coreferential. Word
order and scope of modifiers establish the difference. In Ingush the situation is different. The
infinitive and modal verb (dieza, meg) are prosodically unified to form a single IP. Arguments or
other clause members generally cannot intervene between the infinitive and the modal. Negation,
adverbs, etc. can be understood to have scope over one or the other verb or over both, but this
cannot be overtly marked by changing the position of the adverb or negation (and in particular not
by putting it between the two verbs). Word order of arguments is more or less templatic (subject
precedes object, direct object precedes verb, interrogative word immediately precedes verb) and
does not serve to preserve constituency relations between verbs and arguments. All of this is
equally true regardless of the case of the subject. The examples below illustrate these various
points. (iii) and (v) (marked with minus signs) are stylistically less good but fully grammatical.

(inglingvo.ru/2010/04/21/g1alg1aj-kalendarax-laca.html, accessed Sept. 6, 2010)
Quasi-arguments (subcategorized goals and locations: §22.1) are positioned much like
objects, preceding the verb and following the subject, e.g. (31).
Manner adverbs immediately precede the verb, following all arguments but preceding
any prefixes and proclitics, e.g. dika in (27).
There are certain grammatical factors that change this ordering:
Topicalization. Topics are usually clause-initial, e.g. (79)-(82) below and §33.3.2.
Possibly a special case of topicalization is examples that appear to be quantifier float, with the
quantifier in preverbal position and the topic clause-final.

now it's entirely up to him ('with him') (0816)Focus. A focused word or phrase follows a topic but precedes the rest of the clause
(§30.4, also (79)-(82) below).
Extraction. One or another word, especially a possessor or an argument, is likely to be
sentence-final, perhaps for prosodic reasons: §30.5.
A few morphemes that figure in the literature on adverbs and adjuncts have idiosyncratic
ordering in Ingush because they are clitics or preverbs. qy '(any) more' is a clitic, usually
clause-initial but occasionally initial in a smaller domain (see §5.6.1). Negation is a suffix on
finite verb forms and proclitic cy= on nonfinite forms; prohibition is a proclitic my=. 'Again'
is an incorporable adverb and therefore often found as a preverb (§15.5.3).
30.2.3. Verb-second order. For main clauses, other than episode-initial and other all-new
ones, verb-second order is most common. The verb, or the finite part of a compound verb or
analytic tense form (i.e. the light verb or the auxiliary), follows the first word or phrase in the
clause.

water drink=Q 2s.ERG

"26.2. Headed relatives
The relative clause is preposed to its antecedent (the head), its verb is a participle, and
there is no overt token of the relative noun in the relative clause. The participle agrees in case
with the antecedent, which is in the main clause and has its normal case and word order there.
There are almost no restrictions on relativization. Any case and nearly any syntactic role can
be relativized on, as long as the antecedent is identifiable. Only some alienable possessors
and some pure circumstantials – i.e. adjuncts whose inclusion is entirely up to the speaker and
not at all predictable from the clause structure or choice of verb – are generally not
relativizable. The following examples are cited in approximately decreasing order of crosslinguistic accessibility of syntactic role, and include a range of the different cases or
postpositional forms that can fill that role.197 As in other examples, ___ marks the relative
gap and Ø is an anaphoric or unspecified pronoun (not a relative gap).
197Some of the examples here are from Nichols 1994:13ff., and several of those have been
phonologically or morphologically corrected here.",[612]
"In (44) hana precedes the phrasal verb {c'i oal} [name say] 'name, call, give a name', whose
order is inverted by verb-second order. Interrogative hana must immediately precede the
converb piece (see §30.3.2-3).

"30.6. Existential, locative, and possessive sentences

NEGATION
Negation is formally marked only on the verb in Ingush, regardless of its semantic scope.
(There is one exception to this statement: the negative participial forms discussed at the end
of §31.1.) The word in the scope of negation can sometimes be identified by particles and
prosody, but often there is no formal marking of scope.","[715, 716]"
"28.1. Nominalized possessors
A headless possessor ('mine', 'ours', 'Ahmed's', etc.) is nominalized; for the form of
nominalization and several examples see §§8.3.10, 9.1.3. In (1) txy+jarazh 'ours' is focus and
is syntactically separated from the noun conazh 'hayfields', which does not head an NP in
which 'ours' is modifier. Hwulxoi+jarazh 'the Hwulxoi ones' is in apposition to txy+jarazh
'ours'.

(2), from the traditional store of Ingush jokes, shows two instances of possessor
nominalization triggered by word order rules. It is a dialog between Tamerlane, on his
campaign through the north Caucasus steppe, and Cagen, the Ingush equivalent of Mullah
Nasreddin. In the first line, xala 'difficult' bears emphatic focus and is therefore fronted and
immediately preverbal; what is fronted is not just the adjective but also its head noun, as
unheaded adjectives are disfavored; the verb immediately follows (§§30.2.2-3); and the
stranded possessor must be nominalized. In the second line, the possessor has contrastive
focus ('our language isn't hard; maybe some others are') and is immediately followed by the
verb; 'difficult language' is old information; so 'our' is alone and must be nominalized.",[646]

Another example is (144) in Chapter 13.
Nor are there other object-removing processes. Reflexives and reciprocals are separate
pronouns which occupy a valence place and do not detransitivize verbs or otherwise reduce
valence (see §29.3-4). There are almost no alternations involving objects, such as
applicatives, locative alternations, dative shift, etc.; see §21.2.8.5 for the few verbs that have
any variation in their object coding.
Some auxiliary verbs change the case of a subject: d.ieza 'should' and similar modals
impose a subject case or take case attraction; the intransitive phase verb d.uola-lu 'begin'
imposes nominative case on the subject and the transitive d.uola-d.u imposes ergative case on
the A (see §21.6.3 above); the actual progressive auxiliaries are in origin intransitive verbs
and impose nominative on the A (while the generic progressive auxiliary 'be' allows either
nominative or ergative A) (see §13.4):

Nominalized clauses are common in Ingush, used in complementation of various types
and in clefting (see Chapters 25 and 28). In structure they are headless relatives with a
nominalized participial, all of whose overt arguments receive their normal case marking. In456Ingush Grammarcleft constructions the nominalized clause is always nominative and figures as subject to a
nominal predicate, often an interrogative word (fy 'what', mala 'who'). Word order in the
nominalized clause is verb-final. In the following examples, the nominalized clause is
bracketed. (For more examples see §28.7.)

"1.2. Typological overview of Ingush
Ingush has a fairly large consonant system with three manners of articulation (voiced,
voiceless, ejective) and including uvulars and pharyngeals. Ejectives are not particularly
forceful and plain voiceless stops are not aspirated, so plain-ejective contrast is less audible
than in most languages of the Caucasus. Pharyngealization (phonetically, epiglottalization)
is a phonation property of syllables, audible mostly on the vowel but its distribution based
mostly on the onset consonant. There is a minimal tone system, and a distinctive descending
""sawtooth"" prosody that very demarcates phrases. The vowel system is large, with
diphthongization of most of the long vowels and much centralization of the short vowels.
There is an underlying long/short opposition which surfaces partly as length and partly as a
tense/lax opposition; there is a schwa, whose elision produces long vowels in open syllables
and thereby phonemicizes pure length at least for some speakers. Those speakers who can
hear schwas seem to perceive them as something other than vowels; still, in chanting, other
metric genres, and the speech of some of the oldest generations schwas are audible as vowels,
and those schwas that occur in what I call restressed position are full vowels (and heard as
such). This system of vowel-zero alternations, different sources of length, and schwas with
unusual phonetic status makes it almost impossible to devise a writing system that is
straightforwardly phonemic, a situation that makes it very difficult to achieve literacy given
the way Ingush is taught. Other aspects of the Ingush orthography make it very difficult to
sound out words or spell correctly based on pronunciation.
Ingush is a mostly dependent-marking language. Nouns and pronouns distinguish eight
basic cases and some further secondary ones, whose endings are mostly monoexponential (i.e.
non-cumulative) and, in the plural, follow a separate plural suffix. There are four gender
agreement markers which distinguish, depending on how one counts them, up to eight
genders. Gender agreement is a partial category: only about 30% of the verb roots and 10%
of the adjective roots take gender agreement. Ingush also has overt inherent gender, where
the gender-bearing noun itself has a prefix marking its gender; this is also a partial category,
and is usually but not always the same as the agreement gender class of the noun.
Verbs distinguish a very large number of tenses, which blend aspect and evidentiality
with pure tense. In addition to these there is stem-internal marking of plurality (of S/O)
and/or pluractionality, both partial categories. Apart from the tenses, Ingush distinguishes
various kinds of evidentiality and mirativity by other means such as suffixation and particles.
The three word classes of noun, verb, and adjective are strictly differentiated
inflectionally, syntactically, and in terms of word formation, but they are not on equal footing
in the language. Ingush has a noun-based lexicon: elementary noun roots are an open class,1. The Ingush language and its speakers11while verb and adjective roots are closed classes (about 200 members each). The verbal
lexicon is split: the basic verbs (the closed class) have consistently ergative alignment in their
agreement and derivation, and take the full set of suffixal valence-affecting derivations; the
open class is phrasal predicates with light verbs, and they are mostly accusative in alignment
and limited in derivational possibilities (since most of the light verbs are transitive, while
several derivational categories are limited to intransitives). Basic verbs are mostly
intransitive and form semantic causatives by morphological transitivization; phrasal
predicates and compound verbs form causatives by transitivity-neutral processes such as
suppletion and change of light verb. Adjectives and manner adverbs are not formally distinct,
and neither are converbs and participles. On the other hand, attributive and non-attributive
adjectives, participals, and cardinal numerals are kept strictly distinct.
The numerals are base-ten for the first two decades and base-twenty thereafter. They
form an unusually rich set of derivatives such as ordinals, distributives, nominalized forms,
plex forms, and others.
Verbs form a large set of converbs: three basic ones (anterior, sequential, simultaneous)
used in chaining and a large set used in various kinds of adjunct subordination. There is
rather little finite subordination and almost no subordinating conjunctions; converb clauses
and nominalization are the main devices for complementation and adjunct subordination.
Though verbs of perception generally have dative subjects and stative one-argument
phrasal verbs often have ergative subjects, making it possible to classify Ingush as split
intransitive, it is nonetheless consistently ergative overall, in the morphology of agreement,
case, and verbal derivation, and in syntax. There are almost no valence alternations (such as a
locative alternation). There are derivations that change valence or argument structure
(inceptive, causative) but no inflectional or syntactically-based passivization or the like.
There is extensive and systematic long-distance reflexivization, accusative to neutral in
its alignment, subject- and object-controlled, and partly working to overcome the coreference
problems inherent in contexts of obviation.
Phrases are head-final. Clause word order is like that of early Germanic: verb-final with
frequent verb-second order in main clauses (with prefixes and first elements of compound
verbs left in clause-final position). In most kinds of complex sentences the finite clause
follows the converb clauses. Where English would use clause or VP coordination with
conjunction reduction, Ingush uses chaining and therefore imposes a grammatically rigid
framework with argument sharing and strict choice of verb forms with sequence of tenses on
what would, in English, be a much freer matter of juxtaposing or coordinating sentences with
the same subject or topic. Relativization uses deletion, and unlike chaining and various forms
of nonfinite complementation, which have strict case and/or valence constraints on sharing,
there are almost no constraints on what can be relativized.
Sentences are also mostly head-final, in that most chained and many subordinate clauses
precede the main clause. Controllers of coreference-constrained phenomena, and overt
tokens of shared arguments, are generally in the main clause. Controlled phenomena
themselves can and often do extend far to the left. Long-distance reflexivization and case-12Ingush Grammarbased argument sharing in core chaining, in particular, can extend over many clauses.
Logophoricity affects the immediately dominated clause. These and other factors that require
calculating from the end of the sentence while producing it from the beginning indicate that
fluent speech, especially narrative, requires a good deal of advance planning on the part of the
speaker. Even the phrase and clause prosody require parsing starting from the right edge of
the constituent. Though the Berkeley Ingush Corpus contains mostly the speech of the older,
fully fluent generations and most of my elicitation has been done with fully fluent speakers,
what information I have on the younger generations indicates that many of them are no longer
in full command of the grammatical phenomena requiring this extent of advance planning. If
this is indeed the case, and the younger generation cannot construct complex narrative in
Ingush, the language is becoming restricted in its ability to handle one of the essential
everyday functions.","[33, 34, 35]"

"29.6. Obviation
Obviation is the obligatory ranking of third person nominals (nouns, pronouns) based on
discourse function, syntactic relations, and semantic properties such as animacy. One
nominal in a clause is proximate (as are all its coreferents); the others (and their coreferents)
are obviative. Proximate outranks obviative for access to syntactic roles and processes.
Languages differ in whether and how they require that obviation ranking be aligned with
syntactic relations and animacy ranking. (This analysis of obviation, and the examples and
criteria below, are all due to Aissen 1997.)
Since both possessors and subjects are proximate by definition, in languages with
obviation the following two kinds of configurations are problematic or impossible because
they make two different referents compete for proximate status. (In these schematic English
examples the asterisk means not that the English sentence is ungrammatical but that its
equivalent in a language with obviation would be ungrammatical.)662Ingush Grammar(a) possessor of subject is coreferential to object (bad because possessor is proximate,
therefore subject is obviative and object proximate, therefore obviation and grammatical
relations are misaligned): *Musai's wife is looking for himi; *Musai's friends scared himi. The
same configuration is acceptable where the coreferential nominals are not third person: your
wife is looking for you, etc.
(b) main-clause subject (proximate) is coreferential to subordinate-clause object (which
is then outranked by an obviative subject in the subordinate clause): *Mariemi asked when
Musa had seen heri.
When animacy is aligned with obviation, animates are proximate and inanimates
obviative. In such languages a third configuration is problematic or ungrammatical:
(c) inanimate subject and animate object of transitive verb, e.g. *the snow covered the
sheep.
Obviation has so far been attested only in head-marking languages (Aissen 1997:743),
where strictly grammatical constraints such as obviation are functionally valuable because
they can narrow down the assignment of reference and syntactic relations to formally
unmarked nominals. Something much like obviation is also evident in Ingush, a strongly
dependent-marking language, where it shows up as otherwise inexplicable gaps in formal
antecedence, i.e. in contexts like (a) above. Here are Ingush examples for contexts (a), (b),
and (c).
(a) Third person possessors of subjects cannot formally antecede objects. Asterisked
examples here are ungrammatical where possessor and third person pronoun are coreferential
(but may be grammatical if they are non-coreferential).

The structure and prosody of numeral phrases are discussed again in Chapter 20. The
prosody and phonological treatment of =ji in numeral phrases are similar to those of
coordinated NP's, described in §2.5.3 above.
4.1.3. Accent and prosodic parsing. The foregoing describes words pronounced in isolation,
but the high and low pitches of the stressed syllables actualy represent the working of phrase
and clause prosody, which assigns what I will call primary and secondary accents to stressed
syllables. Any phrase or clause tends to be parsed so that the last two accentable words
constitute a minimal intonation phrase (IP) with the same prosody as compounds. Those last
two words can be a compound, a phrase, or the last word of a numeral sequence plus the
quantified word, all illustrated above. They can also be the object and verb or the two
elements of a light verb construction. The IP is bracketed in the following examples.

In all of these two-accent sequences, the first word has what I call high accent with
relatively high pitch, and the second has low accent and relatively low pitch. The pitch of the

"21.5. Alignment
For the most part Ingush is morphologically ergative. Noun and pronoun inflection are
ergative except that the first person plural inclusive pronouns (plain and reflexive) and third
person singular reflexive pronoun are neutral (S=A=O, no nominative/ergative distinction).
Adjective inflection is ergative in the sense that it distinguishes nominative (S=O) from
oblique, which includes ergative. Verb agreement is morphologically ergative, triggered only
by nominative S or O. There is no morphologically accusative inflection in the language.
Valence patterns of simple verbs are mostly though not exclusively ergative. The basic
intransitive (S), transitive (A, O), and ditransitive (A, T=O, G) patterns are ergative. The
verbs with dative experiencer subjects are mostly two-argument verbs, so they too are
ergative in that dative, like ergative, is an oblique case distinct from the S and O case. Unlike
true transitives, these verbs have a subject coded the same as an indirect object. Bringing
objects into the valence patterns yields the types shown in Table 21-4.
For compound and phrasal verbs the picture is less neat. Many of them have as their first
element an etymological noun that functioned as O in the free syntactic phrase that was the
ancestor of the lexicalized verb:
(61´) aaz
nab
jyr
1s.ERG sleep(J) J.do .WP
'I sleep'
Synchronically these are one-argument verbs with S=A. They are numerous and productive
enough that Ingush could be called a split-intransitive or stative-active language overall, and
certainly the compound part of its verbal language has split subject marking.
Agreement attraction, discussed in §21.6.2 below, is ergative in alignment, like all
agreement. Case attraction (§21.6.1) is accusative: the subject of the main verb takes the case
of a lower subject (S=A). The main suffixal verbal derivations, causatives and inceptive
(§21.7), are ergative in that they have a nominative pivot (the inceptive is (A=G) S=O;
causatives are A S=O). Control of reflexivization (Chapter 29) is accusative, except that in
contexts of obviation the controller is sometimes O (O=T=G) (see §29.3.1). Control of21. Valence, argument structure, and alignment477infinitives is same-subject and accusative (S=A). Argument sharing in nuclear chaining
(§24.3) is ergative at least in conservative usage. Argument sharing in core chaining (§24.4)
is accusative, and the form of the converb in such constructions is ergative with a
nominative/oblique distinction like that of adjectives. Actual frequencies of core chaining
constructions in natural text, however, have an ergative and strongly case-limited bias, with
nominative (S=O) the most frequent controller and target and also less restricted in that S can
control nearly any case and role while A mostly controls A. Thus there is a good deal of
syntactic ergativity in Ingush.
Table 21-4. Ingush valence patterns. For the abbreviations see Table 21-2. An asterisk
marks the accusative pattern.

The basic valence patterns found among simple verbs in Ingush are shown in the
following subsections, ordered from fewest to most arguments. Each valence pattern is
labeled as in Table 21-3, and the argument structure and case valence are given. Verbs are
cited in abstract stem form (with hyphen if this is different from a phonemic transcription of
the present tense). Numbers give the number of radical verbs with that valence. If no number
is given, all known verbs of that valence type have been listed. (For suffixed and compound
verbs see §§21.3-21.4.)
21.2.1. No arguments, no roles, no cases: jieq- 'clear up' (of weather). Predicates of
weather, ambient temperature, etc. have this valence. They take default J gender (see
§19.1.7). There is only one such simple verb: j.ieq-, in origin a specialized usage of
otherwise transitive d.ieq- 'compensate, avenge, clear up'.",[485]

30.4.5. More complex examples. The following example combines a content question
with interrogative phrase ('how come, what for') and focus dou 'feud', in stylistically intricate
published prose. The focus is split between the interrogative phrase and dou 'feud'. The
interrogative phrase is clause-initial rather than in second position because the subject (which
would ordinarily take first position) is in focus together with the verb and cannot be separated
from it. The verb form is analytic, with its finite portion dy following the focused word dou.

As a consequence, the modifiers to dou, 'this' and the relative clause 'which is between our

form, with dou and all of its modifiers in preverbal focus position:

d.weaxa 'long'
d.erzana 'naked'
d.iq'a 'thick' (of liquids)Agreeing adjectives represent under 10% of the basic adjectives.
participles of agreeing verbs are more or less lexicalized as adjectives:
d.änna 'dead'
d.iexaa 'broken'In addition, somed.yzaa 'full'
d.äxaa 'drunk'Participles head relative clauses, and even when in reduced relatives they agree in gender not
with the head noun (the head of the relative clause) but with the S/O in their own valence.
(Of course, it often happens that the head of the relative clause is coreferential to the S/O of
the participle's valence.) (For relativization see Chapter 26.) In the following examples the
gap representing the relativized noun in the relative clause is indicated by an underscore. An
anaphoric or unspecified zero is marked by Ø. (Underscores and zeroes are placed where full
words would be in basic word order: see Chapter 30.) In (2), diesha agrees not with mexkarii

sequence of core chain. Clauses a-g are a series of core chained verbs, using the anterior

conditional (italicized, clause g). All of the anterior converbs have the semantic force of
counterfactual conditional, but this is overt only in clause g (italicized). In addition, two

24.4.3. Word order in core chaining. Word order in ordinary main clauses is verbsecond with a certain amount of freedom to move things into initial or final position for focus
(see §§30.2.2, 30.4). Main clauses in core chaining constructions are verb-initial with great
consistency. This can be seen as verb-second order where the entire chain of converb clauses
(or perhaps just the preceding one) is counted as first position.

"534Ingush GrammarOne of the most common functions of nuclear cosubordination in texts is to combine
manner and motion into a single complex motion predicate with a goal. No simple verb of
Ingush has both manner and motion meanings, and manner-of-motion verbs generally cannot
be combined with a goal phrase. Examples of chained motion verb constructions above are
(48), (51), and others; additional examples are:

In core chaining, the verbs share only one argument or sometimes two, but not the entire
valence; they share tense and mood but not aspect.186 The anterior, simultaneous, and irrealis
converb all figure in core chaining, the anterior converb being by far the most frequent in
narrative. Core chaining constructions generally have the chaining particle ='a enclitic to the
word preceding the converb (see Peterson 2001 and Conathan & Good 2000 for this particle).
That host word may be the verbal prefix, the first element of a compound verb, the direct
object, or (if there is no other host for the clitic particle) a reduplicated copy of the verb stem.
In (66), Muusaa is the shared argument, understood as subject of both verbs. Its nominative
case is assigned by the intransitive main verb aaravealar 'went out'. The transitive converb
danna 'gave; having given' has no overt subject (if it did, it would assign the ergative case to
it). As is more or less obligatory, the finite verb in the last clause is initial in its clause (which
amounts to verb-second order, where the chained converb clause constitutes the first
constituent) (see §30.2.3). Thus the two chained verbs are adjacent.

5.6.2. Unaccented non-clitics are phonologically isolating formatives of verb inflection:
Evidentials (miratives, quotatives): hwuona/shoana (second person mirative), vaina
(first person mirative); joax (quotative and hearsay evidential); tesh, hwogh, vanagh
(introspectives). All immediately follow the inflected verb form. (See §13.6.) These never
have phrasal accent, and the miratives hwuona/shoana, veina may even be atonic. Their
pronunciation has full vowel quality but is otherwise often quite reduced, with the second
syllable nasalizing the preceding vowel but more or less dropping out itself: hwuona [˛–o].
The evidentials include a number of frozen pronominal and verbal forms.
Deictic prefixes: hwa 'toward speaker', dwa 'away from speaker', wa 'down', hwal 'up'. In
basic word order these immediately precede a local prefix or (if that is lacking) the inflected
verb stem (§15.5.1) and are tonic but usually unaccented. In verb-second order (§30.2.3) they
are clause-final and accented (they have low accent: §4.1.3). When hosting a clitic local
prefix =chy or =t'y they are tonic and have high accent.
5.6.3. Tonic words. Comparison: sanna, muo 'like'. (Phrasal scope. §23.1.)
Delimiting: maara 'only, except' (§31.5), duhhwal 'chiefly, primarily'. (Phrasal scope.)
Local: gholla, daa, both 'along', following a postposition (§17.1.6).
Subordinating conjunctions occur in the subordinate clause and mark it as subordinate of
some particular type. There are very few of them in Ingush; the clearest examples are
nagahw sanna 'if' (§27.2.2), hana ealcha 'because' (§27.2.1.), and xaana 'time.DAT', which
takes a modifying oblique participial clause, the whole meaning 'at the time that/when…'.
The anterior and sequential converbs of 'say' eanna/ealie/oalie function as complementizer
with speech verbs (§25.3). Most subordinate clauses are marked by nonfinite verb forms,
specifically converbs if they are adjunct subordinates (such as clauses of time, reason, etc.).
Linking conjunctions: t'aaqqa 'then, so then', heata 'then, so', yshta 'so', cuduhwa
'therefore, so', etc. These occur in the main clause and mark it as having a subordinate clause
or more generally as a main clause with an event that is semantically contingent on that main
clause. For examples see §16.2.3.4. It is worth noting that the subordinating conjunctions
hana ealcha and eanna/ealie/oalie are often prosodically in the main clause, which may mean
that they are turning into linking conjunctions.","[142, 143, 144]"
"1.4. Previous descriptions of Ingush
There has been some very good grammatical work on Ingush, but most of it is traditional
grammar rather than modern linguistics and none of it comprehensive. Description of the
Nakh languages began with Schiefner 1864 and Uslar 1888 on Chechen – the latter a superb
field grammar for its day, but both of them traditional and neither describing Ingush.
Mal'sagov 1925 (Ingush version 1926; Russian version with all Ingush translated into
Cyrillic, 1963; reprint of the 1925 original complete with Latin spelling, 1998) presents
mostly morphology and is accompanied by a lemma dictionary that is very well glossed with
an excellent wordlist. Jakovlev 2001 (written in the 1930's but not published then) is an
insightful traditional syntax with a wealth of data on rarely described points, but too closely
cloned on his 1940 Chechen syntax (it is essentially the same text,with the Chechen examples
transliterated into Ingush, though the differences between the two languages are not just
phonological). There was a publishing hiatus during the deportation, 1944-1957, when the
language was banned. Beginning in the late 1950's, various school grammars and scholarly
work on Ingush were published; Dolakova 1967 and Axrieva et al. 1972 are good examples of
the Ingush grammatical tradition. Nichols 1994a follows a 1970's-era functionally-inclined
questionnaire; it is not complete and contains enough errors of transcription and analysis that
it should not be used. Guérin 2001 is informed by current linguistics but is not
comprehensive and has inconsistencies of transcription and analysis.
No description so far gives an adequate account of the phonology of schwa, clitic
prosody, phrasal prosody, derivational morphology, valence, complementation, chaining,
clefting, argument sharing, reflexivization, or word order, though without these things no
grammar of Ingush can be coherent or describe the language properly. No grammar gives
enough natural examples that a reader can form intuitions about a phenomenon, observe its14Ingush Grammarfull grammatical and stylistic range, or use the grammar to compose teaching materials. (This
latter is a fault not of linguists who have worked on Ingush but of the tradition of descriptive
and field grammar generally, in my opinion.)
In this grammar I have tried to cover
phenomena known to me at least adequately and to give a good range of examples from
different styles and sources.","[36, 37]"
"5.5. Adpositions
True adpositions have argument structure and valence (one argument, whose case is assigned
to it by the postposition) and can head a PP. They can also function as verbal prefixes, and
without objects as adverbs. E.g. jiq'ie 'in the middle; among; inside':

""Particle"" is as good a term as any for this formally diverse but functionally unified set of
uninflected words. All are uninflected in the sense that they do not form the standard noun
and verb inflectional paradigms, though some of them bear frozen inflection, and some of
them enter into functional paradigmatic sets with other words such that they can be
considered inflectional. None has an independent clause word order position; all are
positioned relative to the clause boundaries, the clause head (the inflected verb form), or the
word in the particle's scope. All have scope but no arguments or valence. (In their scope and
positioning they differ from interjections, which largely stand outside of clause and sentential
syntax: §5.7.) They lack lexical meaning and can be described as grammatical elements.
Here they are grouped by prosodic type.
5.6.1. Clitics. Clitic coordinating and chaining conjunctions: ='a, =ji 'and' (Chapter 24).
Both have high tone which spreads to the preceding syllable, and the vowel of the conjunction
itself is a schwa which undergoes elision (§§2.5.1, 3.2.2).
Focus and attenuative focus clitic particles: =m, =q. These are special clitics which are
positioned relative to particular words: =m follows the word in focus, and =q immediately
follows the inflected verb. It is difficult to prove that they are clitics, since they lack vowels
and therefore cannot show clitic vocalism. They are unlike affixes in that they begin with
consonants but never take an epenthetic vowel. In Ingush orthography they are written with a
hyphen, i.e. not as affixes.
Negative proclitics indicative cy= and imperative (prohibitive) my= (Chapter 31). These
have high tone which does not spread as their vowels are never elided.
The emphatic proclitic my (§§16.2.1, 32.4.2, 33.2.1), segmentally homophonous to the
prohibitive negative but without high tone.","[141, 142]"

"460Ingush GrammarDitransitives have direct/indirect alignment, i.e. the theme or patient object is formally
identical to the direct object of monotransitives. Not only ditransitives like 'give' and 'say', but
also verbs of contact like 'strike', 'insert', 'cover', and many others exhibit a valence type in
which the semantic goal is an indirect object and the semantic theme is direct object (T=O):

pienaa
ghadzh tiexar
1s.ERG wall.DAT stick

'I hit the wall with a stick', lit. 'I hit a stick to the wall' (wall = goal, stick = theme)
Very few verbs treat the semantic goal as direct object, and only one verb shows a locative
alternation 158 ('load sand on the truck' ~ 'load the truck with sand': (40)-(41) below).
There are almost no relation-changing syntactic processes in Ingush. Various auxiliary
verbs, including light verbs and the progressive tense auxiliaries, assign case to their subject,
and there are lexical derivations such as the causatives and the inceptive that systematically
derive transitives and dative-subject verbs (respectively) from verbs with other valences.
There are also verbs with ambitransitive valence, chiefly (Ergative) Nominative and (Dative)
Nominative. These are all lexical patterns and derivations that do some of the work done by
relation-changing processes in other languages, and some of them respond to the syntactic
context in ways that might qualify them as inflectional or syntactic, but Ingush has no
passive, antipassive, dative shift, etc. No derivation changes the case of a nominative S/O,
which is the pivot in all word families. This is what Creissels 2010 calls radical P-alignment.","[482, 483]"
"20.1. NP structure
The ordering of elements in the fullest possible NP is shown below. Examples with every
slot filled can be constructed (see §30.1) but are artificial. This is grammatically basic order,
from which some departures are possible for topicalization, focus, extraction, etc. (see
Chapter 30). Genitive 1 = literal possessor or other adnominal genitive; genitive 2 = a
genitive plural with unspecified possessor and more or less lexicalized as a modifier (e.g.

verb-final examples (31)-(33), in fact the clause is verb-second, suggesting that verb-second
order does not require any particular pragmatics.

"65329.4. Reciprocals
Ingush uses two reciprocal words, both uninflected for case. vwaashii is evidently a
frozen nominative plural of a pronominal stem vwaash- (found in other frozen case forms as a
preverb: see §29.4.4 below). vaila/txeila/sheila is the adverbial form of the plural reflexive
216
pronoun; it agrees in person with its antecedent but does not vary for case.
Kurkiev 2004
classifies vwaashii as an adverb and glosses sheila as Russ. mezhdu 'between' (surely a
217
typographical error) without giving it a part of speech.
The two forms are interchangeable
and can be used in any reciprocal context, regardless of the valence of the verb or the syntax,
case, animacy, or agentivity of the subject. Neither word seems to be controlled in any
grammatical sense. vwaashii seems not to fill an argument role but to simply be an
additional word in the clause. vaila/txeila/sheila (etc.) behaves as though it filled an
argument role (object or other nonsubject), but if so it is the only uninflected argument form
in Ingush; alternatively, it is a non-argument word which replaces an overt object. Neither
reciprocal is ever accompanied by any morphological form of detransitivization on the verb
or by a change of subject case from ergative to nominative. Neither has any impact on verbal
agreement or pluractionality. Both are interlinearlized noncommittally here as REC(iprocal).
(98)-(99) are a minimal pair illustrating some of the differences between reflexives and
reciprocals. Both have the verb tar-lu 'get along' (nominative A, instrumental O). In (98) the
reflexive is long-distance, controlled by the main-clause subject. Its case is that required by
tar-lu. In (99) sheila behaves syntactically as though it were an object, but does not take the
verb's object case (it has no case at all). It is controlled by yzh 'they' in its own clause.
Reciprocals are never long-distance in Ingush.

"[O S]In (8) 'rope' is O of the transitive verb 'hang up' and S of 'lie'. The transitive verb has a zero
unspecified A. This configuration – transitive verb first, unspecified A – seems to be the
most common for nuclear chaining of clauses of unlike valence. There are no clear examples
in my corpus of nuclear chaining with intransitive verb followed by transitive.
There are no clear examples in natural speech or good prose of sharing of oblique
arguments or of valence types other than basic intransitive and monotransitive. In most of the
natural text examples the shared nominative argument (whether S or O) is topical or
otherwise important. Thus nuclear chaining can be described as available to only the most
basic valence patterns and strictly sensitive to case with a nominative pivot.
29.1.4. Core chaining. Core chaining has more latitude than nuclear chaining as to
valence and form of shared arguments; see the examples in §24.4. Only one argument must
be shared; occasionally two are, but not the entire valence. The argument is subject in both
clauses, but the subject cases governed in the two clauses can differ. Older speakers sometimes produce sentences with S and O sharing. In (9) (repeated from (78) in §24.4.4), the
shared argument is the beads overt as S in the last clause. In the other clauses it is (in order)
O, S, S, and O. The symbol __ marks the place that the shared argument holds in the nonmain clause, and the case that it would have if overt is shown there in the interlinear.

15.2.8. Verbs used as light verbs. Many, probably most, of the simple verbs in Ingush
form at least a few compound verbs.The simple verbs used most frequently in compound and
phrasal verbs, and as suffixes in non-deverbal derivations (i.e. not causatives and inceptives),
are the following, in decreasing order of frequency (based on my lexical database as of
October 2010). Only the simulfactive singular is listed; pluractional and plural verbs are
counted as tokens of their simulfactives. (There are also some 60 phrasal verbs whose light
verbs are themselves compound or derived.)

Note that a compound verb with any light verb, whether common or uncommon, has
ordinary compound stress (§4.1.2).
15.2.9. Typological observations on compounds and phrasal predicates. An Ingush
verbal compound consists of two elements, of which the first -- the heavy element -contributes most of the lexical meaning and meanings of manner and means, and the second
contributes the finite verbal categories (tense, number, aspect), location, lexical deixis, stance
or positional classification, and valence. The second element -- the light verb -- belongs to a
closed class, in that it is always a simple verb and simple verbs are a closed class. In addition,
the set of simple verbs that function with any frequency as light verbs is a small subset of the
simple verbs. The heavy elements, in contrast, do not form a closed class. Each first element
is lexically specialized, however, and/or has restricted distribution: it occurs with a few
auxiliaries or perhaps just one, its word-class properties are restricted, and its lexical
semantics can be difficult to factor out from the meaning of the whole compound. The
limiting case on restricted first elements is ones like those of cec+d.oal 'be surprised', buu
d.oal 'become financially independent', p'az d.oaqq 'beat up, beat to a pulp', halak du
'destroy', must ju 'pluck', or tug qoss 'spit', where the first element is a cranberry morph of no
determinable part of speech and with no recoverable lexical meaning other than that of the340Ingush Grammarverb as a whole. In the specialized nature and lack of word-class properties of the first part
and the closed class of elements in the second part, and in the kinds of semantic and
grammatical contributions made by the two parts, the two elements match in overall typology
the respective pieces of what are variously known as bipartite verbs (or verb stems),
discontinuous stems, etc. (for some native American languages see DeLancey 1996, Rhodes
1996:130).
As is discussed in §§21.1, 21.2.8, corresponding to Russian or English ditransitive
valence with goal object (G=O), Ingush has mostly ditransitives with theme object (T=O).
The more theme-like of the objects (the one that moves) is treated as a direct object and the
other (the goal) as an indirect or other oblique object.

"CHAPTER 12
VERB CONJUGATION CLASSESThis chapter is based on the system of verb classes and analysis of conjugation worked
out in Handel 2003. Important elements of that system include recognition of ablaut
paradigms as conjugation classes and recognition that the present stem is the most
informative form and the best citation form for linguistic purposes. The numbering of classes
used here follows that used in Nichols 2004, which is intended for lay use and sets up two
additional conjugation classes in order to use a more surface representation. Handel's more
abstract representation groups classes I-II and IV-V as one class each.","[257, 258]"
"645three persons. The syntactic configuration of an object possessing a subject is crosslinguistically problematic for tracking coreference, and triggers obviation in the languages
that have it (Aissen 1997), but the extension to second and third persons and the example
where an object possesses another object ((47), (48)) show that Ingush object-controlled
reflexivization is not identical to obviation. See §29.6 for more on obviation.
29.3.2. Long-distance reflexivization. Ingush makes systematic and frequent use of
long-distance reflexivization. The subject of any clause ordinarily reflexivizes any
coreferents in any lower subordinate clauses (adjunct or complement). There are some
constraints having to do with person, animacy, and interference from other potential
controllers, but apart from these constraints long-distance reflexivization is completely
regular. There is never reflexivization into a higher clause. The shared argument of a relative
or chained clause or an infinitive complement cannot be reflexivized precisely because it is
shared, so that there is no separate lower token. (Any non-shared argument in the chained or
complement clause that is coreferential to the main-clause subject can be reflexivized, and
normally is.)
29.3.2.1. Adjunct clauses. Examples of long-distance reflexivization into adjunct
subordinate clauses are in (51)-(55). Null realization is generally an option, especially for
subjects ((52), (53)). Time and sequence clauses with subject reflexivizing subject (or null
anaphora as in (52)):

"478Ingush Grammarattraction spreads the case of the subject (S/A) of the infinitive to the subject of the infinitivetaking verb; agreement attraction spreads the gender of the S/O of the infinitive to the
infinitive-taking verb; and transitivity attraction causes the infinitive-taking verb to take on
causative or inceptive morphology to echo the transitivity or intransitivity of the infinitive.
All three types are limited to particular verbs.
21.6.1. Case attraction. The verbs d.ieza 'should' and meg 'may, maybe, is possible' take
the same subject case as is required by the embedded verb. (Contrast the cognate verbs which
take specific subject cases: d.ieza 'must, need to' with genitive subject and mog 'can, is able'
with dative subject.) These same verbs also attract the gender of the S/O of the lower verb.

"In contrast, (71) above, a subordinating (and not chaining) construction using a temporal
converb, does have subject-verb order (as is usual though not obligatory).
24.4.4. Narrative chaining. All the above examples of core chaining illustrate narrative
chaining: a sequence of actions takes the form of a series of core converbs, followed by a
main verb (which in spontaneous narrative is very often a verb of motion or location). Rather
often that main verb is intransitive. Its subject, if agentive, can control a mix of nominative
and ergative shared coreferents:

However, in texts from older speakers, it is not uncommon to find syntactic ergativity, with
the shared argument variously S and O. An example is (74) above, where so 'I' is S of the
main clause but shared as O in the chained clauses. Another is (78), where 'beads' is S of the
main clause and shared variously as O (of 'give') or S (of 'come down [as inheritance] to') in
the converb clauses:

"21.8. Notable non-valence-changing processes
Apart from the allative or dative on causees that are ergative with the input verb (§21.7.13 above) and the dative replacing an input ergative in the inceptive (§21.7.4 just above),
Ingush has no valence-changing processes. It has no passive. Ambitransitive verbs (§§21.2.7
and 21.3.1-2 above) give a valence choice comparable to active vs. passive in other
languages.
There is no antipassive and almost no object removal even in verbs such as 'eat', 'cook',
'sew', 'read', which cross-linguistically are often used without objects as activity verbs.
Ingush uses a dummy object: often hama 'something', e.g. d.u' 'eat' (erg. A, nom. O) : hama
d.u' lit. 'eat something' (erg. A, dummy O hama 'thing, something') = 'eat, be eating, dine'.
Common in proverbs and the like is syskal ju' 'eat cornbread' (the traditional staple food).
d.iesh 'read' is lexicalized without an object in the sense 'study, be a student', but this is not
antipassive-like as it still takes an ergative subject as in (164-165).",[519]

Complements of verbs meaning 'know', 'believe', 'hope', etc. are in the subjunctive.
(Some can also take finite clauses with interrogative words: see §25.2 above.) The
subjunctive is most often used with a different subject from the main clause (about 80% of the
examples in the Berkeley Ingush Corpus), but is entirely natural with a coreferential subject
(most often this is reflexivized, otherwise null as in (42) below).
