"11.1.2 Verb types (valency)
Verbs have the usual valency possibilities: intransitive, transitive, ditransitive.
However, the distinction between transitive and intransitive is muddied in
Jamsay by the large number of idiomatic object-verb combinations (including
those with cognate nominals), and to some extent subject-verb combinations;
see below, §11.1.5-6.
Intransitives that have a subject but no direct object include stance verbs
like di N
$ e@- ‘sit down’ and atelic motion verbs like ya$na@- ‘glide’.
Telic motion verbs like ya&˘- ‘go’ and yE$rE@- ‘come’ are basically
intransitive (with optional locational adverbial). They may appear to be
transitive, like the first ‘go’ verb in (618), which has ‘place’ as destination.

‘Places that she previously did not go to, (now) she goes.’ 2004.3.19However, telic motion verbs, in their primary senses, often fail the crucial
test of transitivity in Jamsay: they do not take object pronominals. Informants11.1 Regular verbs and VP structure389generally rejected such proposed combinations as #ko@ ya&˘-ya$-m ‘I went to it’,
and similar constructions for ‘come’, and ‘go out’. Therefore cases like ‘place’
in (618), above, are best understood as covert adverbial PPs with the
postposition omitted. Such omission is most common with place names like
ba$ma$ko@ ‘Bamako’, which in most contexts are understood as adverbial in
nature without an overt postposition.
In the sense ‘go/come to (sb)’ with human destination, a PP with
postposition le$ or its pronominal counterparts is used: mi&-n yE$rE$-Ø ‘He/She
came to me.’
There are, however, some transitive uses of telic motion verbs in nonprimary senses. ya&˘- ‘go’, for example, may take an object denoting the entire
trajectory rather than the destination. In (619), the pronoun ko@ is the object.

‘knock down’, ‘hit’, and the like). ‘Have’ is expressed by transitive quasi-verbs
including sa$- (§11.5.1). There are some ‘put’ verbs with a direct object plus an
optional locational, e.g. na@˘na@- ‘put (sth) up on (sth)’. Basic perception verbs
are transitive: E@˘- ‘see’, a@ƒa@- ‘hear’.
Defective quasi-verb ku$n- ‘be in, be part of’ functions syntactically as
though the sense were ‘be put in’ (cf. the high-frequency transitive ku@no@- ‘put’
or ‘put in’). It requires a locational complement, as in [X bE@rE$] yç@ku$n- ‘be in
X, be part of X’. An example is (621).

derivational morphology; see the discussion of ambi-valent verbs in §9.5. One
typical pattern is where the intransitive functions as a (medio-)passive of the
transitive. There is no productive morphological passive, so the ambi-valent use
of basically transitive verbs fills a void.
Ditransitives include o@˘- ‘give’ and te@˘re@- ‘show’. They have a direct object
for the theme and a dative indirect object for the recipient. (There is no
“promotion” of the dative to direct-object status.)11.1.3 Valency of causatives
Causatives are formed from underlying transitives, as long as the semantics
make sense in at least some situation. Such causatives of transitives have two
direct objects (622).

It is reasonable to speak of “VP” in a broad sense as a clause minus pre-clausal
topics, minus the subject NP, and minus AN inflection. This notion of
subjectless VP is operative in some types of chaining, e.g. with linking particle
me$y<, and in infinitival complements as with (same-subject) ‘want’.
The linear order of preverbal constituents was discussed in §2.6. As noted
there, pronominals (dative, object, and in relative clauses also subject) normally
follow nonpronominal constituents unless focalized or topicalized. The normal
relative order of (untopicalized, unfocalized) nonpronominal preverbal constituents is (623). This order is not rigid.
(623)a. temporal locatives (e.g. ‘yesterday’)
b. subject
c. dative, object, other adverbials (direct object often last)11.1 Regular verbs and VP structure391The relative order of (nontopicalized, nonfocalized) preverbal pronominals
is (624).
(624)a. dative
b. object
c. subject (L-toned subject pronominals in relative clauses)In verb- and VP-chains, preverbal subject markers in particular occur
immediately before the final verb (e.g. the participle in a complex relative
construction), while dative and object pronominals may precede earlier chained
verbs (in bare-stem form). For examples of these ordering patterns see §2.6.
The notion of VP is sometimes difficult to apply in chains, where two verbs
arguably (but detabably) merge into a single “compound verb” and jointly take
a single set of arguments and adverbials, or a partially overlapping set of the
same. See §15.1.5 for examples. As a result, I often refrain from using brackets
to demarcate VPs in chains.","[410, 411, 412, 413]"

or not the subject is also expressed by a nonpronominal preverbal NP). In such
clauses, pronominal subjects are outside of the scope of the linear ordering of
preverbal constituents. This leaves us with objects, datives, nonpronominal
subjects (expressed by noun-headed NPs), and adverbials. The regular ordering
pattern is (13).

second person singular object pronoun (“2SgO”), then a verb with AN suffix
(Resultative) and a 1Sg subject (“1SgS”) suffix. (14.b) illustrates subject-object

‘The hyena ate the hare.’A dative usually precedes a direct object when both are nonpronominal
(15.a), though sequencing is not completely rigid. This ordering is obligatory
when both are pronominal (15.b). However, a Nonhuman object pronominal is18Sketchoptionally omitted when understood, a tendency that is probably intensified in
the presence of a dative pronominal (15.c).

The above is somewhat idealized, since it does not consider focalization or
topicalization. In focalization (§13.1), some constituent preceding the verb
functions as focus, whether or not it is overtly marked as such by Focus clitic
y$. If the focus is a pronominal subject, it appears as an independent pronoun,
with or without y$, and there is no subject pronominal on the verb. This
focalized pronoun appears at or near the beginning of the clause (16).

‘It’s we [focus] who go to bed here.’There is also a great deal of topicalization in Jamsay discourse (§19.1).
NPs and independent pronouns are regularly placed to the left of a sentence,
usually with at least some prosodic break. The sentence proper usually has
pronouns coindexed to these presentential topical NPs (17). This is especially
diagnostic of topicalization in the case of objects, since a pronominal object is
not used in addition to a clause-mate nonpronominal object NP. Many times,
what looks at first sight like a clause-internal NP in subject or object function is
actually a presentential topic.

possessors. This applies to Verbal Noun clauses (§17.4), and to the unusual
‘before …’ construction (§15.2.4.2) in which the verb has a suffix -wv$ with
underspecified vowel. Pronominal subjects are expressed by preverbal
possessor pronominals. The basic ordering pattern is (18).

verb with nominalizing suffixThis can be summarized roughly as Adv-S(Poss)-X-V; an example is (19).
The logical subject (2Sg pronoun) is expressed as a special kind of possessor
only used with nominalized verbs, viz., independent pronoun (H-toned)
followed by Possessive ma$ (which is not used after pronominals in tensed
clauses). The object ‘chicken’ has normal object tone (rather than the tone
typical of compound initials) since it is not immediately preverbal. It is
followed by a dative pronominal (as usual, pronominals gravitate to immediate
preverbal position), then the Verbal Noun of ‘give’.

of a pronominal subject suffix. There is usually an overt internal head NP whose
last word undergoes tone-dropping, but the head can be in any grammatical
relation. The head appears in its usual place in the sentence (there is no
systematic fronting of heads). If the subject is pronominal (and not the head), it
is expressed by a special L-toned preverbal subject pronominal proclitic in
immediate preverbal position. This is connected with the fact that the normal
morphological slot for pronominal-subject suffixes (at the end of the verb) is
occupied by the participial suffix (which agrees with the head NP, not the
subject). The basic order of elements is as in (20).","[38, 39, 40, 41]"

included some other clause types that likewise end in this postposition.
In addition to the specifically purposive and causal clauses considered
below, manner adverbials with d i&˘< ‘place, manner’ as relative-clause head can
also be used in basically purposive sense (1070).

17.6.1 Clauses ending in postposition le$ or le@
17.6.1.1 Purposive or causal clause with L-toned bare verb plus le@
In (1071), a construction with L-toned verb and H-toned postposition le@ has
purposive sense. All textual examples in the texts are given. The purposive
clause is in all cases the complement of a motion verb ‘come’ or ‘go’. The
motion verb itself is often L-toned (1071.c-e), in which case the purposive
complement is probably focal. Elsewhere, H-toned postposition le@ occurs in626Complement and purposive clausessome types of locational PPs (§8.2.2), but without tone-dropping on the
preceding noun. If le@ in (1071) is equated with this postposition, it suggests a
blending of (abstract) purpose and of goal-directed motion.

object are overtly expressed. The linear order is normally subject-object-verb.
This ordering is common even when the subject is a pronoun (violating the
usual principle, enforced in main clauses, that preverbal subject pronominals
immediately precede the verb). It is also possible (but less common) for a
pronominal subject to follow an object (see below).
In the normal subject-object-verb ordering, the object is the inner
(immediately preverbal) argument. It may appear in its regular (i.e. mainclause) direct-object form, or in the form of an alienable possessor
(nonpronominal NP plus ma$, or the alienable possessor form of a pronoun).
The subject is the outer argument in the normal subject-object-verb
ordering. It is most often treated as a special kind of outer possessor. If the
subject is a pronoun, it normally appears as an independent pronoun plus
ma$, for example 2Sg u@ ma$, 1Sg mi@ ma$, and 3Sg wo@ ma$; see (941.a-e), below.
Such a combination never occurs in main clauses, where pronominal possessors
are expressed without ma$ by either H-toned alienable possessor forms (2Sg a@,
1Sg ma@, 3Sg wo@, etc.) or L-toned inalienable possessor forms (2Sg u$, 1Sg mi $,
3Sg wo$, etc.). The only other construction where Possessive ma$ follows an
indepedent pronoun is Verbal Noun complement clauses (§17.4).
If the object is pronominal, the object appears in either (alienable)
possessor (941.a-c,g) or regular direct-object form (941.d,f), e.g. 1Sg
possessor ma@ or direct-object mi@. The difference between possessor and object
series is audible only for the 2Sg, 1Sg, and Logophoric pronominals. Other
pronominals like 3Sg wo@ and 1Pl E@mE@ are ambiguous between possessor and
object, hence the noncommittal P/O in interlinears (941.e).

The distributive quantifier ka^˘< ‘each’ and the demonstrative nu@No$
‘this/that’ do not co-occur, so I cannot order (e1) and (e2) relative to each other.
In practice, ka^˘< ‘each’ nearly always occurs in simple NPs of the shape [noun
+ ka^˘<] with no other modifiers. The combination [noun + adjective + ka^˘<] is
elicitable in the relevant sense (with tone-dropping on the adjective as well as
on the noun), but uncommon, unless a further cE^w ‘all’ is added to insure the
quantificational reading of ka^˘<. Perhaps the tendency to avoid NP-final
quantifier ka^˘< after an already complex NP reflects a homonym clash with ka^˘<
‘also, too’ (variant ka@r<a$), which does occur freely after NPs of any shape. To
be sure, ka^˘< ‘each’ and ka^˘< ‘also, too’ have different tonal effects; ka^˘< ‘each’
induces tone-dropping on the preceding word, while ka^˘˘< ‘also, too’ has no
tonal effect.
There is some variation in ordering within (311.f) area. (f2) and (f3) may
occur in either order. (f1) and (f2) may likewise occur in either order. However,
(f3) must follow (f1) if both are present.
The two demonstratives, discourse-definite in (311.b) and deictic in (311.e),
do not often co-occur, but their combination is grammatical.
Examples are in (312), with the noun heading the NP bolded. The positions
in (311) that are filled in each example are listed in parentheses on the right. I
use _ in these formulae to indicate unfilled slots, with (e) and (f) counted as one

6.1.2Headless NPs (absolute function of demonstratives, etc.)Headless NPs, those where the head noun is omitted and not replaced by a
personal pronoun, are (apparently) headed by another element in the NP. (For a
similar omission of head NPs in relatives, see §14.1.6). The examples of
headless NPs involve deictic demonstrative nu@No$, cardinal numerals, and
adjectives. One could argue that such phrases involve a zeroed noun as head.
In this absolute function, demonstrative nu@No$ is the most common of the
bunch, since there is no other way to express (deictic) ‘this/that’. Cardinal
numerals and adjectives are only occasionally absolute; much more often there
is a noun, even a semantically “light” one like ‘thing’ or ‘person’.
Examples, mostly elicited, of various elements in absolute function are in
(313.a-d). (313.e) has a possessor, a modifying adjective, and a numeral.

types. In (314), for example, I take ko$ to be an L-toned preverbal subject, which
can occur in conditional antecedent clauses (§16.1.2).

ce@ ‘possession’ as head. This form, presumably related to cE&˘ ‘thing’, also
occurs in possessive constructions of the type ‘X is Y’s possession’, i.e., ‘X
belongs to Y’ (§11.5.3). ce@ is an inalienably possessed noun, requiring L-toned
possessor pronominals or a possessor NP without Possessive ma$ (§6.2.1). In
(315.b), ‘theirs’ denotes the girls’ excision ritual, which is parallel to the boys’
circumcision, which was described in the preceding discourse (both are referred
to as “causing to drink porridge”).

This construction is confined to cases where the referent object is
nonhuman. Efforts to elicit a human counterpart, whether alienable (‘boss’) or
inalienable (‘father’), were unsuccessful. For example, ‘his boss/father is good,
mine is bad’ was always translated with the referent noun repeated e.g. (‘his
boss is good, my boss is bad’).
Universal quantifiers are not used absolutely as NPs. However, both fu@˘ and
cE^w can occur with a preceding Nonhuman pronoun ko@ (with tone dropped to
ko$) in the relevant sense; (316.a) illustrates this for fu@˘. The emphatic adverbial
so@y ‘all, everything, totally’ can be used absolutely, as a kind of NP substitute
(316.b).

As explained in Chapter 14, the head NP does not move out of the clause,
instead, its status as relative head is signalled by tone-dropping. The relative
clause ends in a participialized verb with noun-like suffixes agreeing in number
and humanness with the head NP, so the entire clause is morphologically
nominal. (A second copy of the head noun may appear after the relative-clause
proper, following Possessive ma$, but this is not relevant to the present point).
Examples with modifying adjectives and numerals that remain in the head
NP are in (318).

sit.down.Impf-Ppl.NonhInternal bracketing and tone-droppingIn addition to the order of words within NP’s, we must also pay attention to tone
patterns. The NP-internal combinations in (322) require the item on the left to
drop tones to all-L. Here, the item on the left is tonally dependent on the item6.1 Organization of NP constituents231to its right. This will be called leftward tonal dependence. “X” is any word
with the core NP, excluding possessors.
(322)Tone-Dropping within NP
a. [X + adjective]
(“adjectives” includes ordinals)
b. [X + demonstrative nu@No$]
c. [X + ka^˘< ‘each, any’]For example, i $ju@ ‘dog’ has LH tone contour, but is L-toned i $ju$ in i j$ u$ jE@m
‘black dog’, i $ju$ nu@No$ ‘this/that dog’, and i $ju$ ka^˘< ‘any dog’. This leftward
tonal dependence is recursive, as in [[X + adjective] + demonstrative], which
ends up as the linear sequence [X.L adjective.L demonstrative], where “.L”
indexes word-level tone-dropping to all-L.
In the inalienably possessed NP (§6.2.2), if the possessor is a pronoun, both
the left and right constituents (i.e. possessor and possessed) undergo tonal
changes (L-toned pronominal, {HL} tone contour on noun). This is (at least
arguably) bidirectional tonal dependence.
If the inalienable possessor is a noun-headed NP, it has its regular tones, but
the following (inalienably) possessed noun has the same {HL} tonal overlay as
it has after a pronominal possessor. This is rightward tonal dependence.
Therefore “bidirectional tonal dependence” mentioned above can be
decomposed into a systematic rightward dependence requiring a specific tonal
overlay on the inalienably possessed noun (regardless of whether the possessor
is pronominal or not), and a more limited leftward dependence (perhaps
morphological in nature) affecting inalienable pronominal possessors only.
(323)[possessor + inalienable noun]
possessor:
inalienable noun:L-toned pronominals (no change on other NPs)
H(H…)L tone (with any possessor)For example, ‘father’ has a lexical form de&˘ with R-tone, but it appears with
overlaid H(H…)L-tone after either a pronominal or NP possessor: mi $ de^˘ ‘my
father’, se@ydu$ de^˘ ‘Seydou’s father’. In mi $ de^˘ ‘my father’, the pronominal
appears in a form that is segmentally identical to the H-toned 1Sg pronoun mi@
(used as independent pronoun and in several other non-subject functions), but
that has L-tone. (There is also a stem ba&˘ ‘Dad!’, used as a vocative but also, as
L-toned ba$˘-, as a compound initial for ‘father’.)
The universal quantifier fu@˘ ‘all’ (§6.8.1) has the prosodic effects on the
NP-internal item to its left indicated in (324). A preceding pronominal drops its
tones to all-L. This is leftward tonal dependence. Rarely, the pronominal232Noun phrase structureshows dying-quail intonation (). When fu@˘ follows (within the same NP) a
nonpronominal word (noun, adjective, demonstrative), the latter regularly
appears with final-syllable dying-quail intonation. When fu@˘ conditions dyingquail intonation, we have leftward intonational dependence. In either case, fu@˘
itself may have its own intonational lengthening (symbol ), but this is lexical
rather than combinatorial, and also applies to fu@˘ when it has scope over a
preceding clause or non-NP constituent.
(324)Tonal/Intonational effects of fu@˘ ‘all’
a. pronoun: L-toned, occasionally also dying-quail intonation ()
b. non-pronominal word: dying-quail intonation ()Examples: pronominal ko$ fu@˘ ‘all of it/them (nonhuman)’, nonpronominal
i $ju@ fu@˘ ‘all the dogs’. The 1Pl pronoun may even be truncated before fu@˘,
hence E$m pu@˘ varying with E$mE$ fu@˘ ‘all of us’. Rarely, there is some version of
dying-quail intonation with a pronoun (since the pronoun is L-toned, the audible
effect is prolongation): ko$ fu@˘ ‘all of it’.
The other universal quantifier, cE^w ‘all’, almost never has an intonational
or tonal effect on a preceding nonpronominal word. However, rare examples of
dying-quail intonation are recorded (n)E-& m cE^w ‘all the women’). A preceding
pronoun, however, drops its tones before cE^w, as it does before fu@˘ ‘all’. Thus
ko$ cE^w ‘all of it, all that’, E$mE$ cE^w ‘all of us’.
Finally, the NP-internal combinations in (325) involve no tonal change in
the item on the left. In other words, the two components show tonal
independence. There are some further distinctions that must be made, based on
behavior in syntactically controlled tone-dropping contexts (325.a-c).
(325)Tonally Independent NP-internal combinations
a. appositional (symmetrical), undergo tone-dropping in tandem
[X + cardinal numeral]

[X + Plural be@] (usually)
[X + Definite ku$<]6.1 Organization of NP constituents233c. autonomous; only the element on the right may undergo syntactic
tone-dropping
[alienable possessor + X]
In (325.a), the left and right elements have their own tones, including at
least one H-tone (except for low-level reduction of R to L in numerals ‘2-5’
under certain conditions). This is the situation when the NP occurs in a main
clause in whatever function (subject, object, etc.), in isolation (e.g. as topic), or
in a non-head function in a relative clause. However, when the NP functions as
head of a relative clause, the NP is subject to (externally induced) syntactic
tone-dropping. In the constructions in (325.a), this tone-dropping applies
simultaneously to both the left and right elements. For example, in (326.a),
both parts of inalienably possessed sa@ydu$ de@re$ ‘Seydou’s brother’ lose their
H-tones, since this NP functions as head of a relative clause. This is parallel to
the tonal treatment of sa@ydu$ de@re in (326.b), where a modifying adjective has
been added.

In the constructions in (325.b), above, we cannot determine whether both
elements are tone-dropped in tandem. Definite ku$< is normally L-toned anyway,
making the issue of tone-dropping moot. Moreover, ku$< and (in most cases)
Plural be@ are shifted to the end of the relative clause, following the participle.
The only reliably verifiable contrast to (325.a) is therefore (325.c), viz., the
combination of an alienable possessor with an alienable noun. (The great
majority of nouns are alienable.) Here the possessor (a nonpronominal
possessor NP followed by Possessive ma$, or else an H-toned possessor
pronominal), is completely autonomous tonally, retaining its normal tones even
when the following possessed noun undergoes syntactically controlled tonedropping (as head of a relative).
For example, in i $ju@ pE@ru@ ‘ten dogs’, both i $ju@ ‘dog’ and pE@ru@ have at least
one H-tone, as they would in isolation. As relative head, this NP becomes
L-toned: [i $ju$ pE$ru$] go^˘-Ø ku$< ‘the ten dogs who went out’. However, ma@ i j$ u@
‘my dog’ has a tonally independent possessor pronominal (1Sg ma@), so when
i $ju@ drops its tones, e.g. before a modifying adjective, the possessor retains its234Noun phrase structureH-tone(s): ma@ i $ju$ jE@m ‘my black dog’. A textual example showing this is
(327), where na@m ‘people’ but not 3Pl possessor pronominal be@ drops its tones
as relative-clause head.

The most puzzling textual example is (1094). Here we have the quotative
context as in the preceding examples, but the clause with ce@je@-m ‘meet’ is not
attached to another preceding clause (imperative or otherwise). I suggest it is
truncated from something like ‘…the place that you-Sg have told him to go in
order for you-Pl to meet’, but the embedded imperative ‘(told) him to go’ is my
interpolation.

‘(at) the time when I fed him for you-Sg’Let us consider (21.a) in detail. It begins with a temporal noun ‘day’ in
L-toned form, which tells us that this noun is the head of the relative. There is
then an H-toned pronominal for the object (as would be the case in a main
clause), followed by an L-toned subject pronominal (which is unique to
relatives and a few other subordinated clause types). The participial is based on
a Perfective verb, which in relatives takes the form of an unsuffixed Perfective
stem with overlaid H(H…)L tone. Since the head is Nonhuman, the Nonhuman
Participial suffix -Ø is used.
In the interlinears, “.L” after a gloss or label indicates that tone-dropping
has occurred, and “.HL” indicates that a H(H…)L tone contour has been
overlaid. The 2Sg object (“2SgO”) pronoun here has its lexical H-tone, so the
interlinear includes no (grammatical) tonal information.
The importance of pronominal tones in parsing relative clauses is brought
out by comparing (22.a-b). Preverbal pronominals (if not focalized or
topicalized) follow nonpronominal NPs, so 1Sg object mi@ in (22.a) and 1Sg2.8 Relative clauses21subject mi $ in (22.b) directly precede the verb. There is no structural case
marking of nonpronominal NPs, so ‘white person’ has the same form as subject
in (22.a) and as object in (22.b). The verb in a relative is a participle that agrees
only with the head, which is here neither subject nor object, rather the noun
‘day’. So only the tonal difference between mi@ and mi $ differentiates the two
sentences.

‘the day (when) I saw the white person’Another typologically remarkable feature of Jamsay relatives is that the
head noun is often copied after the main part of the relative clause, after a
Possessive morpheme. In other words, relatives can be double-headed (with
one internal and one external instance of the head noun); see §14.1.1. This
expanded type can be represented schematically as (23). No intelligible literal
English translation would clarify it much, but think of ‘the dog that bit me’ as
something like ‘dog of [the dog that bit me]’. Neither instance of the head noun
is pronominalized.
(23)[[… [… Nx …]NP … (SP) Verb-Ppl] Poss Nx]The internal head NP is built around the noun Nx and may also contain a
possessor, modifying adjectives, and a numeral. The noun (with no modifiers)
may then be repeated after the participle, with the Possessive morpheme
separating them. The internal head NP (excluding alienable possessors)
undergoes tone-dropping, while the external copy has its regular lexical tone.
Neither instance of the head noun is pronominalized. Thus ‘a man who comes
here’ can be expressed by the construction (24), the final ma$ a&-n being optional.

"9.4 Passive verbs333Since most transitive verbs have no derivational passive, they just use their
ordinary stem-shape in (medio-)passive as well as transitive function. In other
words, they are “ambi-valent”; see §9.5, below.

"14.2.2 Agentives
Some subject relatives, generally consisting of a simple Imperfective participial
verb without complements, function as agentives.
An example is verb da$na@- ‘hunt’, unsuffixed Imperfective stem da$na^-,
Agentive da$na@-n$ ‘hunter’ (Pl da$na@-m$). There is no formal difference between
‘hunter’ and the imperfective relative clause ‘one who hunts’ (§4.2.3).
However, we can partially distinguish agentives from ordinary subject
relatives when the agentives are extended by incorporating an object noun, or
other complement or adverbial. Here a true agentive takes one of two tone
contours, each associated with a type of noun-noun compound. One type
(§5.1.7), identical in form to subject relatives, is [x# v^-Ppl], where the (loosely)
incorporated element x has its regular tone, and the participial verb has
H(H…)L tone (850.a). The other type (§5.1.9, with many examples), clearly14.3 Object relative clause509distinguishable from ordinary subject relatives, is a more tightly fused
[x$-v@-Ppl], where the incorporated element has its tones dropped to all-L, and the
verb shifts to all-H tone (850.b).

14.3.1 Ordinary object relative clause
In object relatives and other non-subject relatives, if the subject is not expressed
by a nonpronominal NP, it appears as an L-toned subject pronominal
immediately preceding the participle. An example is (851), which also
illustrates the H(H…)L tone contour on the unsuffixed Perfective participle.

‘what you-Sg have accomplished is very good’More nonhuman object relatives are in (852). The head noun and the
Participial suffix are bolded in interlinears. L-toned preverbal subject
pronominals appear in most of the examples, and are italicized in interlinears.
These subject pronominals make it relatively easy to identify the head NP as the
object. In (852.c), however, both subject and object are expressed as
nonpronominal (i.e. noun-headed) NPs. Clues that ‘cattle’ is the object, rather
than subject, are: a) the Nonhuman zero suffix on the participle, b) the fact that
nonpronominal NPs follow subject-object order, and c) the subject-object
animacy asymmetry of the verb ‘chase, drive ahead’.","[530, 531]"

When both subject and object are nonpronominal NP’s, we can get a
stacked-possessor construction of the form [[subject ma$] [[object ma$] pseudocausative]]], as in (942). This resembles the [[pronoun ma$] [possessor-pronoun
verb]] pattern in (941.a-c), above.

PossHowever, speakers find this construction to be rather bulky, and other
variants are observed. First, the subject NP may be topicalized, then resumed
by a possessor pronominal (943.a), which reduces the bulkiness of the
‘before …’ clause proper. Second, the object NP may appear in normal object
form, i.e. without a following Possessive ma$ (943.b-c).

If the subject is pronominal, it is also possible to front the object (as an
outer possessor, with ma$). The subject is realized as a simple (alienable)
possessor pronominal. This allows ‘before …’ clauses to approximate the mainclause linearization pattern whereby pronominals (unless emphatic or
topicalized) follow nonpronominal NP’s. However, since the subject-objectverb order is normal in ‘before …’ clauses, object-fronting may create parsing
difficulties (misidentification of subject and object roles). With verbs like
‘slaughter’ (944.a), the asymmetry between subject and object makes misparsing unlikely. The reading for (944.b) is unlikely for the same reason; see the
more usual reading (941.g). (944.c) is more seriously ambiguous. My
impression is that object-fronting is uncommon in natural speech, especially
when both subject and object are pronominal.

inAdverbials such as dative pronominals or PP’s, or locationals, may be
added, usually with a following Possessive ma$ (which is absent in
corresponding main clauses). Examples of pronominal and NP datives with ma$
are in (945). In (945.b-d), the pronominal subject does not have possessor form;
instead, it appears as an L-toned preverbal subject pronominal, immediately
before the verb (945.b), or as an H-toned independent pronoun, when separated
from the verb (945.c-d). The option to add Possessive ma$ after an adverb is15.2 Adverbial clauses565exercised in (945.d-e). In (945.e), u@ro$ ‘in the house’ is a tonal locative,
equivalent to a locative PP.

Occasionally there is an L-toned nominal compound initial on the pseudocausative ‘before’ verb with suffix -wv$. In this case, if there is a preceding
chained verb, this chained verb cannot also take compound-initial form, so it
takes its regular tones. In (946), the compound initial u$ro$- ‘house’ is based on
the tonal locative u@ro$ ‘in the house’, which occurs in the preceding sentence in
the text. The chained verb is su@mo@ ‘wash’.

This rare pattern is expressed by an L-toned verb and a suffix -se@. PostSonorant Syncope (60) is applicable to Cvrv- and Cvr<v- verb stems. A
pronominal subject is expressed with an L-toned preverbal subject pronominal.
The only attestation in my texts is (947). Here the -se@ clause follows a [v^ v$]566Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clausesverb iteration denoting a prolonged activity (§11.6). The -se@ verb itself is
intonationally prolonged (symbol ) in the example. A gloss ‘when he came’
seems most appropriate in context.

15.2.5 Spatial adverbial clause (‘where …’)
In the usual spatial adverbial construction, di&˘< ‘place’ is the head NP of a

‘(While he was working in the field,) A Fulbe herder came there
and encountered him.’ 2004.4.4Narratives that recount complex episodes from the past are replete with
such unsuffixed Perfectives. The AN category (perfective positive) is typically
predictable in such narratives. I suspect that this is a major reason why the
""defocalized"" unsuffixed Perfective is common in narratives. Some degree of
predictability of the verb stem’s semantic content is perhaps a contributing
factor. However, in cases like ‘stripped them off’ in (550.a), the verb denotes a
new event.
After a quotation, ‘say’ is rather light semantically. While the basic ‘say’
verb ga@˘- has a full set of AN forms including imperfectives, there is also a
common ‘say’ quasi-verb jE$- used only in the L-toned, unsuffixed Perfective
(§11.3.2).
All of this suggests that, within the perfective system, the unsuffixed
Perfective in main clauses is associated with verb defocalization. This is an
elusive concept, relevant to the grammars of many languages, but with much
language-specific detail. In Jamsay it involves any one of the situations in (551).
(551)a. the verb is part of a large defocalized clausal residue (when some
other constituent is focalized);
b. the perfectivity of the verb is contextually predictable and therefore defocalized (as in the middle of narratives where many events
are recounted in chronological order, in perfective aspect); perhaps
low information value of the verb’s own content is also a contributing factor;10.1 Inflection of regular indicative verbs347c. semantically “light” perfective quotative verb (‘said’) after
quotation.
The all-L tone pattern and the lack of overt AN suffixation can, in this light,
be considered to be iconic.
The expanded use of the unsuffixed Perfective, albeit with a different tone
pattern, in relative clauses might be interpreted as reflecting an overall reduction
in focal salience of the verb and other constituents in relative clauses.
There are analogues to the L-toned unsuffixed Perfective with predicative
adjectives and with negative verbs. When a predicative adjective is defocalized,
it not only drops its tones, but also omits the otherwise usual cliticized ‘be’
quasi-verb (§11.4.2). With negative verbs, the regular form (not defocalized)
has L-toned verb stem plus H-toned suffix (Perfective Negative -li@-, Imperfective Negative -go@-). Therefore the only audible cue to defocalization is that
the tone on the suffix drops to L-tone, as seen in (748) in §13.1.2 and (751) in
§13.1.3. There is no overt defocalization for positive imperfective verbs.
10.1.2.3 Marked Perfective (-ti $-, -yE$-/-ya$-, -a^˘-)
The suffixal (=marked) Perfective is used in positive main clauses where the
verb is not defocalized. The suffixed Perfective is almost always replaced by the
unsuffixed Perfective in relative clauses and related subordinated clauses.
There are two basic morphological types of Perfective (positive), one with
-ti -$ and one with -yE$-/-ya$- or -a^˘-. The first is always a classic perfective, while
the second can be interpreted either as perfective in the same classic sense, or as
a resultative-stative.
The choice between the two major Perfective types depends chiefly on the
transitivity and (especially among intransitives) on the semantic type of the
verb. The division is summarized in (552). For perception verbs, which do not
readily co-occur with either Perfective suffix allomorph, see §10.1.2.4.
(552)-ti -$most transitives
active intransitives-yE$-/-ya$-, -a^˘-a few weak transitives (‘resemble’, ‘forget’)
(basically intransitive) motion verbs
(basically intransitive) stance verbs
intransitive (inchoative) adjectival verbs
other intransitive stative verbs348Verbal inflectionExamples of verbs taking -ti $- are: a) classic transitives cE@jE@- ‘cut’
(cE@jE@-ti -$ ), de$ne@- ‘want, love’ (de$ne@-ti -$ ), pa@ƒa@- ‘tie’ (pa@ƒa@-ti $-); and b) active
intransitives plus weak transitives that regularly take fixed “objects” such as
cognate nominals (gç@lç@rç@) dç$n)ç@- ‘snore’ (dç$n)ç@-ti -$ ), (ni@˘) i n
$ e@- ‘bathe’
(i n
$ e@-ti-), mç$w<ç@- ‘laugh’ (mç$w<ç@-ti -$ ), te@ge@- ‘speak’ (te@ge@-ti $), yi n
$ e@‘breathe’ (yi n
$ e@-ti -$ ), and pe@re@- ‘jump’ (pe@t-ti -$ , but with variant pe@y-ya$-).
I have no clear idea as to the origin of -ti -$ . It most likely has a common
history with ti@ as a linker (indicating a sequential chronological relationship)
among chained verbs (§15.1.16). There is some possibility of a more distant
connection with the transitive verb ti@˘- ‘send’.
The choice between -yE$-/-ya$- on the one hand and -a^˘- on the other is based
on the phonological form of the verb, as summarized in (553). Variation
between -yE$- and -ya$- is free; both occurred in my tapes in the speech of
individual informants, and it was often difficult to distinguish them.

b. -a^˘nonsyncopating bisyllabic stems
trisyllabic and longer stemsThe allomorph -yE$-/-ya$- perhaps derives historically from ya&˘- ‘go’. Indeed,
many of the verbs taking -yE$-/-ya$- are motion verbs. It seems unlikely that
allomorph -a^˘- is historically related to the phonologically similar verb a@˘‘catch’, but -a^˘- might have some historical connection to (the onset of) the
Habitual suffix -a@˘ra$- in the imperfective system.
Monosyllabic stems with -yE$-/-ya$- include dç@˘- ‘arrive, reach’ (dç@˘-ya$-),
go@˘- ‘go out’ (go@˘-ya$-), be@˘- ‘stay, live’ (be@˘-ya$-), ni@˘- ‘sleep’ (ni@˘-y<a$-), na@˘‘pass the night’ (na@˘-y<a$-), and ya&˘- ‘go’ (ya&˘-ya$-).
Syncopating bisyllabic stems (those of shape Cvrv- or Cvr<v- ) that take
-yE$-/-ya$- include yE$rE@- ‘come’ (ye&y-ya$-), ga$ra@- ‘pass by’ (ga&y-ya$-), lo@ro@- ‘get

(mç&y<-y<a$-), and u$rç@- ‘go up’ (u&y-ya$-). On Post-Sonorant Syncope (60), which
(with two exceptions not relevant to this section) applies only to CvCv- stems
with short vowels and with medial rhotic r or r<, see §3.5.3.2.
Nonsyncopating bisyllabics with -a^˘- include na@Na@- ‘forget’ (na@N-a^˘-),
ti@me@- ‘resemble’ (ti@m-a^˘-), nu$mo@- ‘fall’ (nu$m-a^˘-), su$go@- (su$g-a^˘-), di N

(do$n)-a^˘-).
Trisyllabic examples are ko@mo@n)o@- ‘became wrinkled’ (ko@mo@n-) a^˘-),
na@Na@-r<a@- ‘remember’ = reversive of ‘forget’ (na@Na@-r<-a^˘-), and ba$na$-r<a@‘become red’ (ba$na$-r<a^˘-).
The rare combination of-yE$-/-ya$- or -a^˘- with a syntactically transitive verb
is illustrated in (554). The few verbs in question are the very epitomes of wimpy
transitivity.

themselves to either the (classic) perfective or the stative-resultative reading.
Thus ni@˘-y<a$-Ø can mean ‘he/she went to sleep’ (perfective, event completed
before time of reference), or ‘he/she is sleeping’ (stative-resultative, state
continuing into the present). Motion verbs favor the straight perfective reading,
though of course a completed motion event also creates a state. Thus go@˘-ya$-Ø
‘he/she went out’, contextually also ‘… has gone out’ = ‘… is out, is not here’.
Adjectival stative verbs also favor the perfective (in this case inchoative)
reading, e.g. ‘became red’, but for a different reason, viz., the adjective itself is
used predicatively to denote a timeless state: predicate adjective ba@nkç$ ‘it is
red’, intransitive perfective ba$na$-r<-a^˘-Ø ‘it became red’ or ‘… has become
red’.
The fact that the Perfective suffixes can differentiate transitive and
(intransitive) stative verbs makes it easier to understand why Jamsay has so
many ambi-valent stems that can be transitive or intransitive. For example,
do@mno@- ‘finish’ has two Perfective forms, each associated with a particular
valency: do@mno@-ti -$ in transitive function (‘X finished Y’), but do@mn-a^˘- in
intransitive function (‘Y came to an end’). Likewise, with an inchoativefactitive pair of deadjectival verbs, du$gu$-no@-ti -$ must be interpreted as transitive factitive ‘X fattened Y’, while du$gu$-n-a^˘- can only be intransitive
inchoative ‘Y became fat’.","[366, 367, 368, 369, 370, 371]"

A topical NP does not induce reflexive possessor of a coordinand in the clause
proper. Therefore (1141) has simple 3Sg possessor wo$ (inalienable) rather than
Reflexive E$nE@ ma$. In other words, a topical NP does not count as “clause-mate
subject” for this purpose.

X and Y in the formulae below are understood to be other than first or second
pronouns.
Consider a construction [X VERB1 [Y VERB2 [ __’s Z]], using English
order to clarify grammatical relations, where VERB1 is a control verb taking a
subordinated clause with VERB2. In Jamsay, if the NP in the blank possessor
position is coindexed with either X (higher subject) or Y (clause-mate subject),
the possessor has reflexive form. This accounts for the ambiguity of (1142),
where E$nE@ may have either ‘Amadou’ or ‘my father’ as antecedent.

In a construction of the type [X VERB [Y VERB Z]], where Z is direct

In (1144), we see that the sense [X cause [Y to VERB [Y’s Z]]], expressed with
a single verb as [X Y [Y’s Z] VERB-Caus], does not allow Y to serve as
antecedent for a reflexive possessor. Therefore we get 3Sg possessor wo@ rather
than Reflexive E$nE@. In other words, the fact that Y is the (underlying) subject of
a clause does not count for purposes of antecedent determination in this case.

In (1144.b), if we substitute Reflexive [E$nE@ n)a&˘] for 3Sg possessor [wo@ n)a˘& ]
‘his meal’, Jamsay listeners infer that the meal belonged to the mother, see
(1145). That is, causative clause-union creates a structure with only the higher

When an original utterance like ‘you want your nose’ is quoted, the subject is
expressed as 3rd person, e.g. 3Sg wo@ (§17.1.1). However, this “false” 3rd
person (understood to be a substitute for 2nd person) cannot serve as antecedent
for a reflexive possessor. Therefore ‘you want your nose’ is expressed as ‘3Sg
want 3Sg’s nose’ with no direct indication of coindexation. The Jamsay for
‘3Sg’s nose’ is [wo@ ci@r<E@]. See line 2 of (1267) for the relevant textual example.","[682, 683, 684, 685]"
"2.1ProsodyPrevious published and unpublished descriptions of Dogon languages have
regularly commented that some form of lexical tone or accent is present, and
that it is subject to grammatical modification. However, no previous study has
actually analysed the prosodic system of a Dogon language.
In Jamsay, tone (lexical and grammatical) and intonation (including
grammaticalized intonation patterns) play a central role. Indeed, I know of no
(non-Dogon) language where prosody is so tightly integrated with the
morphosyntax. Working on Jamsay has deepened my conviction that currently
dominant grammatical theories, with their sharp compartmentalization of
“phonology” and “syntax,” are badly misguided.
The prosodic ingredients are given in (1). H[igh] and L[ow] are the
primitives of the tonal system. F[alling] and R[ising] are abbreviations for twopart contour tones <HL> and <LH>, respectively.

—end of both conjuncts in NP conjunction
—end of word preceding universal quantifier fu@˘ ‘all’The contribution of tonal and intonational elements to Jamsay grammar is
therefore vast. Jamsay does with prosody much of what other languages do with
grammatical morphemes, or with morphosyntactic restructurings including
linear movement. Three examples: 1) most pronouns (excluding suffixes on
verbs) show no variation in segmental form across independent, subject, object,
and possessor categories, but use tones to make some distinctions (e.g. 3Pl be@
for independent, object, and alienable possessor, but be$ for subject and
inalienable possessor). 2) NP’s X and Y are normally conjoined in Jamsay
simply as [X Y], with no conjunction morpheme but with dying-quail final
intonation on both conjuncts. 3) the difference between main and relative
clauses is largely (though not entirely) expressed by tonal modifications. In
relatives, the (internal) head is not fronted. Instead, the final word of the head
NP drops its tones, a pronominal subject is expressed (in non-subject relatives)
by a preverbal L-toned pronominal, and Perfective verbs have the H(H…)L tone
overlay. There are also Participial suffixes, but since the form for Nonhuman
head is -Ø (zero), as is the 3Sg subject form in main clauses, the Participial
suffix cannot be relied on as an audible indicator of relative-clause status.
At the lexical level, tone is also important. Most native Jamsay words are
built up with Cv and Cv˘ syllables, with a smattering of CvC and a few Cv˘C
and extra-long Cv˘˘ syllables. Cv is monomoraic (=has one mora or syllabic
weight unit), Cv˘ and CvC are bimoraic, and Cv˘C and Cv˘˘ are trimoraic. Each
mora can have its own tonal primitive, H[igh] or L[ow], so a monomoraic
syllable can be only H or L, a bimoraic syllable can be H, L, F (= <HL>), or R
(= <LH>), and a trimoraic syllable can be any of the above or bell-shaped
<LHL>. There are some minimal pairs such as di@gE@ ‘bird’s leg’ versus d i $gE@
‘row’, ç$˘r<ç@ ‘monkey’ versus ç&˘r<ç$ ‘waterskin’, and ci@rE@ ‘horn’ versus ci$rE@
‘hard wood’. Many word families include a noun and a related verb that differ
in tone. For example, the HH-toned noun bi@rE@ ‘work’ is associated with the
LH-toned verb bi r$ E@- ‘work’, and the two regularly combine in the VP bi@rE@
bi r$ E@- ‘work, do some work’.","[29, 30, 31]"

In (1081.b), the first jE@ is purposive, the second (after wç^˘-Ø) is adverbial;
see discussion of quasi-relative jE@ (me$y<) adverbial clauses in §15.2.2.2. The

ya&˘-y$ jE@ by another purposive phrase ya&˘-y$ le$ (followed by wç^˘-Ø jE@ me$y<)
(1073.b).
The construction with H-toned jE@ is easily distinguishable from verb forms
with Recent Perfect suffix -jE$- (§10.1.2.6).
17.6.3 Reduced purposive clause in compound form (n$ v^)
We now turn to a (more or less) purposive construction with a sharply reduced
subordinated clause in the form of a noun-verb compound, functioning
syntactically as a noun (suggesting that the “verb” has been nominalized). The
noun is L-toned and the verb (in bare-stem form) has overlaid H(H…
… )L tone.
The main clause which follows has a motion verb (‘come’, ‘go’, ‘enter’). The
stance verb ‘sit down’ is also allowed, but here too the motion component is
probably relevant.
Examples from the texts are in (1082). Note that the subject of the stance or
motion verb is identical to the (unexpressed) subject of the purposive clause.

‘if you-Sg go (to the fields) to farm’ 2004.4.4 [< (1280)]In (1082.e), the purposive a$ma$-sa$w-ku@no$ is embedded in a larger
compound involving the (agentive) participle of ‘come’. This outer compound
is of the type [x# v^-Ppl] (§5.1.7).
The L-toned noun and (nominalized) H(H…)L-toned verb are suggestive of
a perfective relative clause with L-toned head noun and H(H…)L-toned
unsuffixed Perfective participle. However, the purposive compound does not
allow the preverbal L-toned subject pronominals that are regular in relatives,
and there are other formal and semantic differences that make a conflation
impossible. A tonal similarity to the rare agentive compound type ya$˘-yE@rE$-m
‘go-and-come women’ (§5.1.8) is suggestive, but again there is no semantic
connection.
Definite ku$< is uncommon after the purposive compound, but it occurs in
(1083).

The ‘enter’ examples suggest that “purposive” is a misleading label for the
construction at hand. Given that the main clause has a motion verb, it may be
that the noun-verb compound is interpreted by native speakers as locative,
hence ‘go (in-)to [meal/eating]’, parallel to the more transparently locative
‘enter into [brick-making]’.
Though redundant, given that the purposive clause and the motion or stance
verb have the same subject, a possessor denoting the subject of the purposive
clause may be added (1085).

restricted to nominalized clauses (verbal noun clauses, ‘before …’ clauses with
pseudo-causative). In effect, H(H…)L-toned yE@rE$- ‘come’ is treated here as

17.6.4 ‘So that …’ or ‘had better’ (v# + -m)
There is a purposive construction of the type (1088). Here the purposive (‘so
that …’) clause follows the main clause, or at least does so often. This sets this
construction apart from other subordinated clauses, which precede (or are
embedded in) the main clause.
(1088) [main clause][… v# + -m]For examples see (1091-3) later in this section. The notation [v# + -m]
means that the verb has its lexical tones (though an R-toned monosyllable may
be heard as L-toned), and is followed by an atonal suffix -m that acquires its
surface tone from the preceding morpheme. The tonal pattern distinguishes the
current construction from the Hortative, which has an H-toned -m@ suffix after a
tone-dropped all-L stem, i.e. [v$ + -m@] (§10.4.3).
A pronominal subject is expressed with a clause-initial independent
pronoun, arguably a presentential topic.
The sense ‘had better’ or ‘must’ is expressed by combining [… v# + -m]
with ti@la^yy$ ‘it is an obligation’ (< noun ti@la^y). We see this in the extended
passage (1089). The verb tE@mE@- ‘find’ has its lexical HH tones before -m, hence
tE@mE@-m. The HH tone contour makes it clear that this is not a plural participle
(cf. Perfective tE@mE$-m, Imperfective tE@mE@-m$), and that it is not a 1Sg subject
form (Perfective tE$mE$-m, Imperfective tE@mE@-m$).","[652, 653, 654, 655, 656]"

The basic relative clause pattern has an internal head NP (marked by tonedropping), and a participle agreeing in gender-number features with this head
NP (rather than an inflected verb agreeing in all pronominal features with the
clause subject). Modifying adjectives and cardinal numerals remain with the
internal head NP, but some other NP-final elements (e.g. Definite ku$<, Plural
be@, universal and distributive quantifiers) follow the participle. The participle
itself therefore behaves somewhat like an adjective modifying the head noun in
several respects (recall that modifying adjectives also force tone-dropping on
the modified noun, and precede the NP-final elements mentioned above).
It is also possible to expand this core relative clause structure (ending with a
participle and perhaps one or two NP-final morphemes) by adding a copy of the
head noun (not the full head NP), as a special kind of external head.
Specifically, this copied noun is “possessed” by the relative-clause proper,
which functions here as the possessor NP (and is therefore followed by
Possessive ma$). The complete construction may be suggested (crudely) by a
structural paraphrase, whereby ‘a/the dog that I saw’ is expanded as as ‘dog of
[a/the big dog that I saw]’, though of course the linear order in Jamsay is very
different (with the external ‘dog’ at the end). The copied external head noun is
optional, and occurs in fewer than half of relative clauses occurring in my texts,
but it is nonetheless quite well-attested.
The internal head NP is occasionally omitted, whether or not the external
head is present. This results in an internally headless relative. However, in
such cases it is reasonable to think of a “light” head noun (such as ‘person’,
‘thing’, ‘place’, ‘time’, or ‘manner’) as being virtually present, though
phonologically inaudible. Furthermore, the participle agrees with this virtual
head: (human) Singular, (human) Plural, or Nonhuman. We can therefore think
of the agreement morpheme on the participle as a stand-in for a full head NP,
just as subject-pronominal suffixation on the verb of a main clause can function
as “subject NP.”
Thus the maximal relative-clause construction might be described as
double-headed. However, the Jamsay construction (when examined in detail) is
rather unique, and I question how useful it would be to assign it to a general
“double-headed” typological category.","[499, 500, 501]"
"3.5 Segmental phonological rules53These derivatives must respect the constraints on verb stems described
above: stem must end in a non-high short vowel, and the stem-wide vocalism
must involve either identical vowels or an acceptable harmonic sequence.
To account for the derived verbs in terms of traditional phonological rules,
we assume that the suffixal vowels are underspecified, and recognize the
processes in (54).
(54)a. Suffixal Vowel-Spreading
b. Presuffixal V2-RaisingThe two processes must be ordered as given.
For the tones of suffixally derived verbs, which are generally predictable

17.6.2 Purposive clause with final jE@
Purposive postposition jE@ may be added to a clause with an imperfective or an
imperative verb. In the latter case, the fact that we are dealing with a
morphological imperative, rather than with a bare verb stem, is brought out by
verbs where these two forms differ tonally, viz., the majority of Cv&˘- and Cv$Cv@verbs.
In (1079), the first jE@ has scope over the two parallel imperfective clauses,

imperfective aspect, this construction is identical in form to the quasi-mainclause subtype of adverbial clause with jE@ (me$y<) if the me$y< particle is

"Importantly, this insures that tone-dropping, by which the entire stem
shifts to L-tone, always has an audible effect. Tone-dropping is widely used in
Jamsay morphosyntax: with nouns (as relative-clause heads, or before
adjectives); with adjectives (before other adjectives); with pronominals (as
preverbal subjects in relative and other subordinated clauses, as inalienable
possessors, and before some discourse markers); and with verbs (e.g. before
Negative suffixes or when AN categories are defocalized). Tone-Dropping also
plays an important role in relative clauses.
Below, I will suggest a reformulation of constraint (99), in the context of an
autosegmental interpretation of Jamsay tones, to the effect that the basic lexical
form of each stem has exactly one H tone-component. This in turn will raise
the possibility that some Jamsay stems are all-L lexically, but are supplied by a
default H-tone in order to satisfy the exactly-one-H-tone constraint (§3.7.1.5).",[104]

trisyllabic verbs that are not derived suffixally from other attested verbs. The
C2/C3 sequences in these stems are strikingly reminiscent of those seen in
suffixal derivatives where C3 is the suffixal consonant. The data can be
summarized in tabular form, taking C3 as point of departure (542).

w< 915 after C2 = r, 4 after C2 = l, 1 after C2 = g
all after nasal/nasalized C2 including 7 C2 = r<(542.a) is without much interest (one case of b, and six Fulfulde borrowings
witn n). All cases of N, n), r<, and w< follow nasal or nasalized C2. Factoring this
out, we note a high incidence of r, w, j, and g (in descending order of
frequency). These correspond nicely to the consonants in the derivational
suffixes we have considered (-rv@- for reversive and a few causatives, -wv@- in
causatives, some causatives in -gv@- and -jv@-). Moreover, the associations of
these suffix allomorphs with particular C2’s, commented on in the sections
above, recur here. This suggests that most of the synchronically underived
trisyllabic verbs not borrowed from Fulfulde originated as suffixal derivatives.
Strikingly absent from C3 position in the sample of one hundred verbs are
many consonants that occur as C1 in this same set of verbs. The data for C1
(excluding Fulfulde causatives) are: b = 8, c = 5, d = 6, g = 4, j = 6, k = 12, l
= 6, m = 1, n = 2, p = 9, s = 9, t = 4, w = 6, y = 5, and zero (vowel-initial) = 11.
Therefore stops {b g j} and sonorants {n w} occur both as C1 and as C3; stops
{c d k p t}, sibilant s, sonorants{m N y) occur as C1 but not as C3; while r
(which is very rare initially) and nasalized sonorants {w< r<} (which cannot
occur word-initially) occur as C3 but not as C1.","[359, 360, 361]"
"3.5 Segmental phonological rules65In the inter-word counterpart, a bisyllabic word loses its final u if this is
preceded by an unclustered r. Elsewhere r< patterns phonologically like r, but
this time it does not; informants rejected apocope of words ending in …r<u. For
example, contrast e$r<u@kç$ ‘it is plump’ with the very common e@rkç$ (from
e@ru$) ‘it is sweet’. Were …r<u to apocopate, it would be realised as …n by
Derhoticization (§3.5.5.1), as it is word-internally after Post-Sonorant Syncope
(60). Speakers seem to resist Derhoticization in inter-word cases.
The most frequent cases of ...ru subject to apocope at a boundary are 2nd
and 3rd person dative pronominals ending in -ru@, when followed directly by a
verb. Apocope is most common when the verb begins with another coronal, but
I have several textual examples where the u is apocopated before a nonhomorganic consonant. 3Sg Dative wo$-ru@ becomes wo&-r before t in (69.a), a
very common result, but (69.b) shows that the same 3Sg Dative form
apocopates at least occasionally to wo&-r before g, and (69.c) shows a similar
apocope of yi $ru@ ‘garment, clothes’ before b.

2004.3.14In (69.a), wo&-r is actually pronounced [wo&t] with r assimilated to the initial
t of the following word, though (for the sake of morphemic transparency) I
transcribe the pre-assimilation form.
Apocope does not occur with trisyllabic stems. For example, I have never
observed apocope with do@gu@ru@ ‘time’, hence do$gu$ru$ ka^˘< (not #do$gu$r ka^˘<)
‘each time’.
The two dative pronominals not ending in -ru@ are 1Sg mi&-n and 1Pl E$mE&-n.
These were probably once *mi $-ru@ and *E$mE$-ru@, or rather (with NasalizationSpreading) *mi $-r<u@ and *E$mE$-r<u@. If so, for these first person datives, the
original apocopated variants mi&-n and E$mE&-n, with n replacing the disallowed
syllable-final r< by Derhoticization (76), have now generalized.
Adjectival predicates with Nonhuman subject (§11.4.a) provide additional
cases of apocope after the rhotic: ç$ru@ ‘fresh’ and predicative ç&rkç$ ‘it is fresh’;66Phonologye@ru$ ‘sweet’ and predicative e@rkç$ ‘it is sweet’. Note that k is not homorganic to
r. The relationship of this type of u-Apocope to Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) is
brought out by the failure of long-voweled je@˘ru$ ‘bitter’ and of trisyllabic
o$nu$r<u@ ‘smooth, sleek’ to apocopate: je@˘ru@kç$ ‘it is bitter’, o$nu$r<u@kç$ ‘it is
smooth’. For the tones in e@rkç$ and je@˘ru@kç$ see Rightward H-Spreading
(§3.7.4.4).
In compounds, the boundary between the initial and the final is usually
treated as a word boundary phonologically. Inter-Word u-Apocope (and Rhotic
Assimilation (77)) may become lexicalized in common combinations. An
example is bE$n-na@˘ ‘she-goat’, cf. bE$ru@ ‘goat’.
Having described the two major subtypes of Inter-Word u-Apocope, I now
consider the morphosyntactic environments in which they regularly occur (70).
It should be noted that no inflected verb, or bare verb stem, ends in u (see
§3.4.4), so no combinations beginning with a verb are candidates for apocope.

Regarding (71.d), complex numerals are compound-like sequences subject
to (morphophonological) lexicalization. In decimal terms (‘10’ to ‘90’), which
begin with pE@ru@- ‘ten’, apocope occurs in pE@t-ta$˘n ‘thirty’ but not in pE$ru$-su^y<
‘seventy’. What may be happening here is that numerical adjacency (as
reinforced by out-loud recitation) is the mother of phonological similarity. ‘70’
shares an aversion to apocope with the ’60, ‘80’, and ‘90’, while ‘30’ shares a
receptivity to apocope with ‘20’, ‘40’, and ‘50’. These two subseries of decimal
terms also differ in tones (§4.7.1.3).
The strongest aversion to apocope is at the boundary between two NPs
(excluding the case where the first is an inalienable possessor). Apocope
between ‘uncle’ and ‘shed’ was therefore rejected in (72). Contrast this with
(71.h), above, where the same [mi $ bo@ru$] ‘my uncle’ does apocopate when it
functions as inalienable possessor, i.e. as a kind of loose compound initial.

other cases where a word apocopates directly before a word, it is a cognate
nominal, a simple noun, or a dative pronominal; all of these are liable to
function either like compound initials or like (pronominal) proclitics.
My assistant also rejected apocope before discourse marker sa&y ‘only’, and
before sa$- ‘have’ (in the negative form sa$˘-ra@-, which can directly follow an
object noun). Therefore he did not accept apocope in (74), even in sentences
where the elements shown are presumably bracketed together.

consistent with the absence of #r<C clusters.
(76)Derhoticization
/r</  nbefore C or word-finallyThe rule is needed to account for cases where Post-Sonorant Syncope (60)
(§3.5.3.2, above) has deleted a short vowel after r< before a coronal. Thus
dç$r<ç@- ‘sell’, Perfective dç&n-ti -$ , Perfective Negative dç$n-li@.
The only other combination where /r</ is clustered with a following
consonant, at any stage in derivations, is when the same Post-Sonorant Syncope
rule (60) applies before y. This is handled not by Derhoticization, rather by
Rhotic Assimilation (77).
I know of no cases where /r</ is clustered with a following consonant other
than a coronal or y, at any stage in derivations.
ti&n-Ø ‘(fire-)wood’, in form a Verbal Noun, cf. cognate noun-verb sequence
ti&n-Ø ti@r<e@- ‘go in search of firewood’, shows that r< also shifts to n when word
final. Other verbs reject Suffixal u-Apocope (67) in such cases and therefore
avoid the problem. There are a few nouns and adjectives with a final n that
historically reflects word-final *r<, e.g. ba@n ‘red’; compare cE$nE$ ba@n ‘anger’
(originally ‘red heart’) with the associated verb (cE@nE$) ba$r<a@- ‘(heart) anger
(sb)’.","[86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91]"

Among the most common heads of relatives are i@ne@ ‘a person (who…)’, cE&˘ ‘a
thing (that…)’, and spatiotemporal and manner nouns like do@gu@ru@ ‘time’ and
d i&˘< ‘place, manner’. On the spatiotemporal and manner cases, see the
discussion of relevant adverbials in Chapter 15.
A pronoun may not head a relative. Instead, the pronoun is placed to the
left in its independent form (with H-tone), in apposition to a proxy noun, either
human i@ne@ ‘person’ (812) or nonhuman cE&˘ ‘thing’. The independent pronoun is
external to the relative clause proper. Tone-dropping applies to the proxy noun
(hence i n

When the head of a relative is a conjoined NP, expressed by dying-quail
intonation on both conjuncts, the left conjunct has its regular tones plus the
dying-quail conclusion. The right (=second) conjunct most often takes ordinary
tone-dropped form with no intonational prolongation (814). However, other
treatments of the right conjunct are possible; see (417) and surrounding discussion.

Internally headless relatives with no overt head NP within the clause are also
possible. In most such cases there is also no external head noun, but see (802)
above for the occasional internally headless but externally headed relative type.
The omission of a head NP is similar to the omission of the (implied) noun in
headless NPs (§6.1.2).
(815) illustrates headless subject relatives. The full expansion of (815.a)
would have i@ne@ ‘person’ as overt head, while those of (815.b-c) would have cE&˘
‘thing’ as head, the head taking L-tone form in each case (i$ne$, cE$˘). In (815.d), a

"128PhonologyOf particular interest is the way resyllabification applies to relative-clause
participles ending in Sg -n or Pl -m. Such a participle can have a final-syllable
contour tone under two conditions. First, since all verbs end in an H-toned mora
in their lexical form, the floating L-tone added to the end of the stem to form the
unsuffixed Imperfective ends up being expressed on the suffixal nasal. Thus
/a@˘- L -m/ ‘catch.Impf-Ppl.Sg’ with floating L-tone and Pl Participial -n is
realized as a@˘-m$ [a@am
@ $]. Adding the ‘it is’ clitic y$ (postconsonantal allomorph

a^˘-m in transcription, they are homophonous when word-final. However, the
phonological distinction is apparent when the ‘it is’ clitic is added. Whereas
Imperfective a@˘-m$ appears as a@˘-mi $˘ as just seen, Perfective a^˘-m appears as
a^˘-mi^˘. The derivation of this form requires that both tone components of the
stem’s F-tone (i.e. <HL>) be associated with the stem vowel rather than with
the suffixal nasal when the clitic induces resyllabification. This entails ordering
resyllabification before Contour-Tone Stretching (143), which is therefore bled
(=prevented from applying) (147).

"14.3.2‘what they call “X”’The verb ga@˘- ‘say’ may be used in a special type of object relative. This
construction is very common in interview-style texts where an expert speaker is
explaining e.g. agricultural techniques, and periodically introduces technical or
archaic vocabulary. Jamsay ‘what they call “X”’ can be freely glossed as ‘socalled X’. The subject is 3Pl (nonspecific referentially), the verb is a participle
based on Perfective ga^- with H(H…)L contour, and Definite ku$< is regularly
added. With zero suffix, ga^- is lengthened by ga^˘-Ø by Contour-Tone MoraAddition (141). The quoted term has its normal tones, and is therefore not the
head NP. Therefore, when no obvious object NP is present, as in (853.a), a zero
object functioning as relative head is posited. In (853.b), an object NP ‘women’
(the third word in the example) is an overt direct-object head. The quoted term
is therefore an adjunct and is neither relative head nor direct object.

After a focalized constituent, I recorded L-toned jE$. The relevant example is
(754) in §13.1.5. Both the fact that jE@ allows Focus clitic y$ to attach to the

A verb-like status is also suggested by (475), where jE@ following a noun is

"14SketchThe ‘say’ verb ga@˘-, quasi-verb jE$-, and quotative particle wa (wa$, wa@)
(§11.3) constitute a complex subject in Jamsay and other Dogon languages.
Some clause-subordinating elements are based on the ‘say’ verb or quasi-verb
(§15.2.2)2.3ParticiplesIn relative clauses (and therefore in various spatio-temporal and manner clauses
in relative form, as well as in various agentive compounds), the verb takes a
Participial suffix instead of a pronominal subject suffix (§14.1.8). The
Participial suffixes are Nonhuman -Ø, (human) Sg -n, and (human) Pl -m.
These are the same suffixes used with most simple nouns, and with adjectives.
The Participial suffix agrees with the head of the relative, regardless of its
grammatical relation (subject, object, etc.).
The verb in a relative clause, if perfective (positive), normally appears in a
special H(H…)L-toned form of the unsuffixed Perfective.
Because participial agreement is with the head rather than with the subject,
in non-subject relatives some way must be found to express a pronominal
subject. This is accomplished by using a set of L-toned preverbal subject
pronominal proclitics, corresponding functionally to the subject pronominal
suffixes that occur on verbs in main clauses. (These L-toned pronominals are
not used in subject relatives, where the subject is indexed in the participial
ending.)
Therefore the way to say ‘the place where I saw you’ can be schematized as
(7).
(7)place.L 2SgO1SgS.Lsee.Perf.HL-Ppl.NonhThe head is ‘place’, so it appears with L-tone (“place.L”). Since this is a
nonhuman noun, we get Nonhuman Participial suffix (“Ppl.Nonh”) on the verb.
There is a 2Sg object pronominal proclitic (H-toned u@), and an L-toned
preverbal subject pronominal proclitic (1Sg mi $). Since the verb is perfective
positive, it appears in the unsuffixed Perfective, with H(H…)L tone contour
overlaid. The actual Jamsay phrase is (8).

"Given the Constraint Against All-L-Toned Stems (99), one could consider the
possibility that one or another of the attested lexical tone patterns is a default,
applied to underlying L-toned stems in order to satisfy the constraint. I do not
favor this (pure) constraint-satisfaction model, but if I did I would suggest finalmora H-tone as the default. In this view, which I will call the default-finalmora-H analysis, verbs with (monosyllabic) R, bisyllabic LH, trisyllabic LLH,
and so forth, are reinterpreted as having no lexical H-tone, with the final mora
secondarily acquiring H-tone to satisfy the constraint. The same would apply to
nouns, adjectives, and numerals that have L-tone up to a final H-toned mora.
Possible evidence for this applicability of the default-final-mora-H
approach to nouns is provided by a small numer of human nouns that normally
(and in some cases exclusively) occur with Sg -n or Pl -m. The stems in
question have a final R-tone in these suffixed forms, and the suffixal nasal is
required to permit expression of the H-tone component of R (i.e., <LH>). The
four known examples are ç$ƒç&-n ‘chief, Hogon’, sa$ƒa&-n ‘chief’s subordinate’,
dç$ƒç&-n ‘Dogon (person)’, and su$rgç&-n ‘weaver’ (plurals ç$ƒç&-m, sa$ƒa&-m,
dç$ƒç&-m, su$rgç&-m). ‘Chief’ has an unsuffixed form ç$ƒç@ ‘leader (e.g. of animal
pack)’, with final H-tone replacing R-tone, and ‘Dogon’ has an unsuffixed form
dç$ƒç@ meaning ‘Dogon language’, while ‘chief’s subordinate’ and ‘weaver’ do
not occur without suffixes. In the default-final-mora-H analysis, these stems are
underlying all-L /ç$ƒç$/, /sa$ƒa$/ , /dç$ƒç$/, and /su$rgç$/, and the final mora secondarily acquires H-tone, for example in unsuffixed ç$ƒç@ and in suffixed ç$ƒç&-n.
A theoretical objection to this argument is that e.g. unsuffixed ç$ƒç@ ‘leader’
can also be derived from /ç$ƒç&/ by a simple tone rule converting R to H tone on a
final monomoraic syllable; see Final-Cv R-to-H Reduction (154), §3.7.4.6,
below.
Additional grist for this debate comes from tonal relationships between
underived and suffixally derived stems; see below, §3.7.3.1.
In the sections that follow, I will suggest an autosegmental model for
Jamsay tone, while acknowledging the existence of a few counterexamples to
the rules proposed. In its strongest form, an autosegmental model of tone
separates the segmental tier from the tonal tier. Strictly speaking, the segmental tier must itself be organized into syllables, moras, and feet, but since
these are derivable from the segment string I will speak loosely of these as
elements of the segmental tier.
A stem, or a word, consists of non-null strings of segments and of tonecomponents. Curly brackets {…} will be used for strings of H and L components at stem or word level. For example, u@ro@ ‘house’ consists of uro at the
segmental level and {H} at the autosegmental level, while its tonal locative u@ro$3.7 Tones97‘at the house’ has the same segments but a bitonal {HL} tone pattern. Both the
segmental and tonal tiers may be morphemically complex.
For this model to work perfectly, there must be rigorous association
processes that connect the tone components H and L to the correct syllables
and/or moras. These processes are easy to formulate when the tonal tier is
monotonal, i.e. just {H}, since of course in this case the H component will
associate to all syllables (and moras) at the segmental level; i.e., it will spread
throughout the stem or word. The rules are also easy to formulate when the
number of tone components, the number of syllables, and the number of moras
all converge, for example bitonal {LH} for a CvCv stem. Complications arise
with bi- or trimoraic syllables, since now the association rules must decide
whether to associate tone components with syllables or with moras. The
challenges increase to the extent that the number of tone components is mismatched with the number of relevant segmental-tier units (syllables or moras).
For Jamsay, no pure autosegmental model will work perfectly for all wordclasses. However, it is possible to develop a model that works well for verbs,
and that helps explain statistically important patterns for nouns.","[118, 119]"
"6.8 Universal and distributive quantifiers257With a nonhuman pronoun, ku$< occurs in the high-frequency combination
ko@ ku$< ‘that’, denoting some entity or situation previously introduced into the
discourse, often in a resumptive fashion (as topic of a following sentence). A
good example with clear discourse context is the third line of (408). Other
examples of ko@ ku$< are (192), (207.a), (280.b), (484.a), and (507.a).
6.8Universal and distributive quantifiers6.8.1‘Each X’ (ka^˘<) and ‘all X’ (cE^w, fu@˘, so@y)Three forms are relevant here. Distributive quantifier ka^˘< behaves like an
adjective (or compound final), forcing tone-dropping on a preceding noun. It is
best glossed ‘each, every’, and occurs most often in simple NP’s consisting just
of [noun (+ adjective) + ka^˘<]. It does not co-occur with determiners
(demonstratives, Definite) or with other quantifiers such as cardinal numerals. It
must be distinguished from homonym ka^˘< ‘also, too’ (variant ka@r<a$), which
occurs freely after a wide range of NPs (and other constituents) and has no tonal
effect on the preceding word (§19.1.3).
Universal quantifiers cE^w and fu@˘ (the latter also pronounced pu@˘ after a
nasal) are more emphatic, may be glossed in context as ‘all’ or less often ‘each,
every’, and occur at the end of the constituent they have scope over. cE^w and
fu@˘ do not force tone-dropping on a preceding nonpronominal NP. However, fu@˘
does induce the dying-quail final intonation (symbol ), i.e. prolongation and
exaggerated falling tone, on the preceding word when it modifies a
nonpronominal NP (§3.8.3): u$r<o@ fu@˘ ‘every hole’, roughly phonetic [u$r<o@o#o$
fu@˘]. The  effect is usually omitted, but occasionally audible, in pronominal
combinations, e.g. [ko$() fu@˘] ‘all of it, everything’.
Both cE^w and fu@˘ force L-tone on a preceding pronominal (but not noun):
E$mE$ cE^w or E$mE$ fu@˘ ‘all of us’. ‘Everything’ is expressed by [ko$ ce^w] or [ko$
fu@˘], where ko$ can be taken as the tone-dropped counterpart of Nonhuman
pronoun ko@, or (less likely) as the prenominal demonstrative ko$. 1Pl E@mE@ is
often apocopated before fu@˘, with the f then hardening to p after the nasal: E$m
pu@˘ ‘all of us’. fu@˘ is sometimes itself prolonged intonationally: fu@˘. An
elicited example is (381), where fu@˘ shifts to pu@˘ after a nasal. I have difficulty
in text transcriptions determining when the intonational marking  is justified
for fu@˘, since universal quantifiers are naturally emphatic.

rather than as #[[money Def] 3Sg-Dat all give.Perf.L-1Sg] (#[bu@˘du$ ku$<]

However, a topical NP like ‘the money’ in (382) may be resumed by a
pronominal plus quantifier.

fu@˘ ‘all people, everyone’. By contrast, this stem appears as i n
$ e$ without suffix
(and with tones dropped) before ka^˘< ‘each’, hence i $ne$ ka^˘< ‘each person’. A

(384) shows that all three quantifiers can be used at least loosely in
distributive sense. The version with ka^˘< (384.a) is clearly predominant in this
context (if the noun has no other modifiers). However, if special emphasis is
placed on the fact that every single person was given a sheep, a singular

"17.3.4.2 Recognition (inference, hearsay) construction
A different construction of the type ‘see that [proposition]’ denotes recognition
(involving inference or deduction) rather than witnessing (simple perception).
Here, instead of a relative-clause complement, we get one with ordinary AN-17.3 Factive (indicative) complements609inflected verbs (any aspect, positive or negative). As in the previous directperception examples, there is no pronominal-subject suffixation on the verb.
However, now a pronominal subject shows up not as an L-toned preverbal
subject pronominal, rather as an H-toned independent pronoun (1036.a-b).
In my interpretation, the complement no longer has a participle (with
unexpressed nonhuman head), rather a verb inflected for AN but not
pronominal-subject category. In other words, the complement clause is similar
to the subject-focalization construction, except that (in my data) the overt Focus
clitic y$ is not present on the independent pronoun in subject function. (1036.a)
is perfective negative, while (1036.b) is an imperfective negative. (1036.c) has
the ‘it is’ clitic y$ (postconsonantal i^˘). (1036.d), with the same meaning, is a
standard adjectival predicate with ‘be’ quasi-verb.

17.4 Verbal Noun (and other nominal) complements
The Verbal Noun has suffix -y@ after a monosyllabic stem, elsewhere -u@. The u@
is lost under some conditions, by Suffixal u-Apocope (67) after a sonorant
(§3.5.4.1). A Verbal Noun may be formed from any regular verb, but not from
defective quasi-verbs like wç$- and kç$ ‘be’, or sa$- ‘have’, nor from stative
stance verbs confined to inflected perfective forms such as da$˘<- ‘sit’. Verbal
Nouns are formed directly from uninflected verb stems, one consequence of
which is that there are no negative Verbal Nouns.
A Verbal Noun (or other nominal denoting an action), can be used in a
complement clause, as the following sections will demonstrate. The Verbal
Noun may be accompanied by a full range of internal arguments, so we should
really speak of a Verbal Noun clause.
Verbal Noun phrases may also function as regular arguments of verbs. In
(1041), the Verbal Noun phrase is the subject of ‘arrive’.

2004.3.16612Complement and purposive clauses17.4.1 Structure of Verbal Noun Phrase
The structure of a Verbal Noun Phrase may be summarized as in (1042).
(1042) a. the verb is nominalized as a Verbal Noun;
b. an immediately preceding chained verb appears as an L-toned
compound initial;
c. an unmodified object noun usually appears as an L-toned
compound initial:
—very common with cognate nominal or generic object (§11.1.6);
—possible for a a wider variety of object NPs when preceded by a
subject NP (in possessor form)
d. other NPs and adverbials typically appear in possessor form
—the inner possessor (adjacent to VblN) has normal alienable
possessor form
—an outer possessor (not adjacent to VblN), even an independent
pronoun, has a following Possessive ma$
Overall, the structure of a Verbal Noun phrase, especially the treatment of
preceding constituents, is similar to that of ‘before …’ clauses, which have a
nominalized verb that I call pseudo-causative (§9.3, §15.2.4.2). The main
syntactic difference is that Verbal Nouns are more prone to object-compounding
than are pseudo-causative nominals.
The word-level morphology of Verbal Nouns is described in §4.2.2.
Examples showing how a chained verb immediately preceding the VblN
appears as an L-toned compound initial are (1043.a-b). (1043.c) shows that a
chained verb retains its normal form when something else (here an object noun
as compound initial) intervenes.

NP may appear as a possessor of the VblN, unless separated from the nominal
by an intervening element such as a dative pronominal. Possessor status is
standard when the object is pronominal, or an NP that does not lend itself to
being a compound initial (e.g. a plural noun, a multi-word NP, or a personal
name). The possessive structure is seen clearly in (1044.a), where ma@ is unambiguously a 1Sg possessor pronominal (contrast 1Sg independent pronoun or
object mi@ and 1Sg preverbal subject mi $). (1044.b) has Nonh ko@ in the same
construction. (1044.c) has a plural NP (‘women’) as logical object, expressed as
a possessor with Possessive ma$.

meat’ and the like, where the object is a “real” noun, we can get either a
compound (1045.b) or a possessive construction (1045.c). (1045.d) is another
example of the compound structure.

A possessor does not necessarily prevent the noun from appearing as
L-toned compound initial, as long as the noun’s referent is generic (1046). One
could argue that the (surface) morphosyntax in such examples is of the type
‘hole-digging of ditches’ and ‘debris-sweeping of date palms’, though in main
clauses ‘ditches’ and ‘date palms’ would be possessors of ‘hole’ and ‘debris’,
respectively.

As shown below, when both the subject (as possessor) and the object are
overtly expressed in a Verbal Noun clause, an unusually wide variety of object
NPs are forced into compound initial status.
The subject of the lower verb is often coindexed with the main-clause
subject, and in this case it is not repeated in the lower clause. However, a
subject may appear in a Verbal Noun clause in certain contexts. With
intransitives (i.e. in the absence of a co-occurring object NP), the subject is
expressed as a possessor (1047).

In transitives with both an object and a subject expressed, the subject
normally appears as an outer possessor, followed by Possessive ma$ (even after
an independent pronominal). The construction is easy to elicit, and occurs17.4 Verbal Noun (and other nominal) complements 615occasionally in texts, provided that at least one of the two arguments is
pronominal. ‘Cat’ in (1048.a) is followed by Possessive ma$, as are the pronouns
1Pl E@mE@ and 2Sg u@ in (1048.b-c). The 2Sg example (1048.c) demonstrates that
the pronominal preceding ma$ is in independent pronoun (rather than
possessor) form, since 2Sg independent H-toned u@ is distinct both from
alienable possessor a@ and from L-toned inalienable possessor u$. (1048.c) also
shows that the logical object E$n)E@ ‘chicken’ appears in normal main-clause form
with lexical tones (rather than as possessor or L-toned compound initial) when it
is separated from the VblN by an intervening element (here a dative
pronominal).

It is more difficult to elicit examples where both subject and object are
nonpronominal NPs. The recursive-possession construction, of the type
[NP ma$ [NP ma$ VblN]], is what we would expect based on the preceding
examples. It is in fact elicitable (1049), but in practice speakers avoid it.

Instead, speakers generally express the logical object as an L-toned
compound initial rather than as a possessor, resulting in [NP ma$ noun.L-VblN]
with just one morphologically overt possessor (in normal alienable possessor
form), as in (1050.a-c). Some of the normal restrictions on nominal compound
initials (generic reference, no separate pluralization, no separate possessor) are616Complement and purposive clausesrelaxed to allow generous use of the compound construction. Thus (1050.a) is
preferred to (1049), above, although it allows the compound initial to keep its
Plural suffix -m. Likewise (1050.b), with unmodified ‘millet’ that can be
construed as generic, may be expanded as (1050.c), where ‘my’ is logically the
possessor of the millet, hence ‘(the) eating (of) [my millet]’. This forces a nongeneric reading of ‘millet’, but it still appears in compound-initial form; the
surface morphosyntax is, apparently, ‘my [millet-eating]’, though not in the
sense this would have in English.
However, my assistant did balk at using the compound construction when
postnominal modifiers (numerals, demonstratives) forced nongeneric readings.
So (1050.d) was unproblematic (the modifying adjective permits a generic

initial seems to be regular even when it is a toponym or a personal name, as in
(1051). Such flagrantly non-generic nouns are elsewhere disallowed as initials
in noun-noun or noun-agentive compounds. This is further evidence of the
lengths to which speakers will go to avoid the recursive-possessor construction
in Verbal Noun clauses.

The strategy of expressing the object as L-toned compound initial,
regardless of generic or specific reference, makes this construction resemble
syntactic tone-dropping in relative-clause subjects, rather than ordinary compounding. Verbal Noun clauses contrast with the other productive nominalized
clause, the ‘before …’ clause with pseudo-causative nominal, which seems to
have no problem with recursive possessors.
A PP or other adverbial may appear in a Verbal Noun clause with

Dogon groups have spread across the border into Burkina Faso. As a whole, the
family belongs to the vast Niger-Congo phylum, but its precise position relative
to other Niger-Congo families (e.g. Mande, Gur) is very unclear at this point.
The internal structure of the Dogon family is also very unclear, as is the number
of mutually unintelligible languages it contains.
The French colonial administration, having little interest in small native
languages, favored (macro-)ethnic over (precise) linguistic classification, hence
“Dogon” rather than e.g. “Jamsay,” and labeled linguistic varieties within each
such macro-ethnicity as “dialects,” a tradition maintained even in current
Francophone scholarship. For similar reasons, (macro-)ethnic classification
suits African governments fine. The official language policy in Mali, for
example, is to equate “language” with (macro-)ethnicity, select the linguistic
variety spoken in a particular focal community as standard, develop pedagogical
materials in this variety, and teach it as “mother tongue” to schoolchildren and
interested adults everywhere who belong to this ethnicity. In the case of Dogon,
the Toro-So variety of the Sanga area was chosen as standard Dogon and is the
basis of government-approved literacy efforts in the region.
Using the test of mutual unintelligibility as diagnostic, on the other hand,
there are clearly many distinct Dogon languages in Mali. We do not yet have
Dogon-wide data in a form that would permit demarcation of language
boundaries and accurate genetic subgroupings. However, having surveyed the
varieties spoken in the northern and northeastern parts of Dogon country, I can
report the following as distinct languages, using the towns of Dountza and Boni
(primarily Fulfulde-speaking) and Koro (Dogon and Mossi) as geographical
reference points:
1. Jamsay (aka Diamsay), see below;
2. Beni, spoken in Beni and Gamni south of Dianwely Maoudé, and in
Kumboy village hugging Fombori mountain between Beni and Douentza;
3. Walo, close genetically to Beni, spoken in Walo at the western end of the
long Gandamiya inselberg (on the opposite side of which is Kikara, where the
Songhay language Tondi Songway Kiini is spoken);
4. Nanga (naNa), spoken in a village cluster including Anda, Soroni,
Namakoro, Wakara, and Kono southwest of Beni and broadly east of the2 Introduction
Tommo-So (Tombo-So) speaking zone that begins at Kasa and extends to
Bandiagara;
5. Tabi-Sarinyere, spoken by the people sometimes called Tandam, east of the
town Boni (which is just off the highway, between Douentza and Hombori), in
several villages ringing the widely separated inselbergs of Tabi and Sarinyere,
plus a few small villages and one substantial one (Koyo) on the two inselbergs
framing Boni itself;
6. Najamba (= Bondu), spoken in a cluster of villages west and southwest of
Douentza including Koubewel, Adia.
After the initial failure of government-supported instruction in Toro-So in
Dogon villages of the Douentza-Boni zone, local groups have launched literacy
programs in Jamsay and Bondu and these are now being taught in primary
schools. Aside from its own mother-tongue villages, Jamsay is being taught in
the Tabi area (whose people have long known Jamsay as a second language,
since Mondoro is not far away). The children of Beni have been attending
school in Jamsay-speaking Dianwely Maoudé, where Jamsay is of course used,
pending the construction of its own school. Jamsay is slowly acquiring the
status of a locally dominant “standard” Dogon in the Douentza-Boni region.","[20, 21, 22, 23, 24]"
"3.7 Tones109This problem can be easily resolved within either the default-final-mora-H
analysis (mentioned but not endorsed in §3.7.1.5, above), or the autosegmental
model that I prefer. In the former, the verbs in (120.b) are underlyingly L-toned.
Both the simple stem and the derivative undergo a late rule creating an H-tone
for the final mora, in order to satisfy the constraint (99) against all-L stems.
In the autosegmental model, the difference between (120.a) and (120.b) is
that the autosegmental level has (lexically specified) {H} in the first case and
bitonal {LH} in the second. In the latter, it is then necessary to specify that the
H is associated with the final mora of a verb stem, as already stipulated in
(113.c) in §3.7.1.7, above. The interesting point is that this association is postderivational; that is, it applies to suffixally derived stems in the same way as to
underived stems. There is no evidence for cyclical application. The derivations
of bu$ro@- ‘be revived’ and its causative are in (121), omitting detail about
vocalism that is not relevant here.

tonal associationPhonology of H(H…)L and H(L…)L tone overlaysThere are two {HL} tone overlays: a) the widespread H(H…)L and b) the more
restricted pattern H(L…)L that occurs in the first stem in one type of verb-stem
iteration. The two overlays are audibly distinct only with verbs of three or more
syllables. Take, for example, ga$ma$r<a@- ‘divide, share’. The H(H…)L overlay is
realized as HHL in the unsuffixed Perfective ga@ma@r<a$- in relative clause
participles. In the relevant iteration pattern, H(L…)L appears in the first part of
(and indeed the whole of) ga@ma$r<a$-ga$ma$r<a$.
The existence of two distinct {HL} overlays is obviously a problem for an
autosegmental approach to Jamsay tones, and perhaps to any other “phonological” approach. However, there is a clear asymmetry. H(H…)L occurs
widely in Jamsay, turning up in multiple grammatical contexts involving all
lexical word classes.
The H(L…)L pattern occurs in one verb-stem iteration pattern that may
involve up to three L-toned stem iterations following the initial H(L…)L
occurrence (§11.6.3). For example, a trisyllabic verb with two iterations has a
tone pattern HLL-LLL-LLL. The iterations have clearly undergone tonedropping, erasing lexical tones, but one can argue that the tone-dropping begins
with the second syllable of the first occurrence, hence H[LL-LLL-LLL]. This,110Phonologyplus the initial H-tone (which is not lexical), suffice to characterize the tones of
this iteration construction. This is a unique, global tone pattern overlaid on the
entire sequence of stems, not a stem-specific overlay like that for all of the
H(H…)L overlays. Moreover, this iteration pattern is stylistically marked, being
typical of narrative style, unlike the stylistically neutral constructions that
require H(H…)L overlays.
… )L is clearly the phonologically regular instantiation of
Given that H(H…
{HL} in tone overlays, the question arises whether the association rules for this
overlay are the same as those for basic stems of autosegmental type {HL} as
described above. The central generalization for tone-component association for
stems, extracted from (113.c) in §3.7.1.7, above, is repeated here as (122).
(122)associate final L (preceded by H) to the final moraFor example, the basic lexical forms of {HL} noun stems with a final bi- or
trimoraic syllable are overwhelmingly …F rather than …L in form. For
example, the (C)vCvC segmental shape has 18 cases of lexically HF-toned
(C)v@Cv^C against zero cases of HL #C)v@Cv$C, see (104) in §3.7.1.3, above. The
asymmetry extends to trisyllabic stems, e.g. of shape (C)vCvCvC, where we get
a total of 8 …F stems including 5 HHF (C)v@Cv@Cv^C against one …L stem,
which happens to be of shape CvCCvCvC (107).
To see whether the grammatical H(H…)L overlay is consistent with this,
we must review how it applies to mono-, bi-, and trimoraic stems. To do this,
we must piece together an overall picture from facts gleaned from the individual
subtypes.
For inflected verb stems, the H(H…)L overlay occurs in unsuffixed
Perfective participles (in relative clauses). The input-output relations are
indicated in (123). The overlay is limited to stems, disregarding pronominalsubject suffixes (which have no intrinsic tones and so will eventually acquire
their surface tone by low-level rules). All inflected verb stems of more than one
syllable end in a Cv@ syllable (not Cv@˘ or Cv@C), so we do not have a full range of
syllabic types. The lexical tones of the inputs are irrelevant to the outputs so
they are not indicated here.","[130, 131, 132]"
"118Phonology(133)Tone Dissimilation
In decimal numerals beginning with pE@ru@- ‘ten’, this morpheme drops
its tones when the following single-digit numeral begins with an H-tone3.7.3.5Atonal-Morpheme Tone-SpreadingThere are a number of suffixes, with no intrinsic tone, that can be added to
nouns, adjectives, or verbs. The relevant phonological shapes are -Ø (zero), -C
(-n or -m, i.e. always a nasal), and syllabic -vC or -Cv.
The nasals are phonologically straightforward for nouns and verbs, since
the relevant stems are vowel-final and the final vowels carry tones. These tones
are simply spread over the resulting bi- or trimoraic final syllable in a natural
way. If the tone is simple H or L, this pure tone just spreads to the nasal. If it is
a contour tone, the final tone component is realized on the nasal; see ContourTone Stretching (143), below.
There are two morphological combinations, however, where an atonal
syllabic suffix is added to a tone-specified stem (134).
(134)a. Sg -in or Pl -um after C-final adjective
b. 3Pl -ba or 2Pl -be in inflected verbIn both cases, there are some issues involving stems with final contour tone;
these will be taken care of in connection with Final-Tone Resyllabification
(148). For present purposes it suffices to point out that the final tone of the stem
is spread into the previously atonal suffixal syllable. This is seen most clearly
when the final syllable of the unsuffixed stem is monotonal H or L. For adjectives, only H-tone occurs (135.a). For verbs, both H- and L-tones can be
adduced (135.b-c).
(135)a. jE@m ‘black’
Sg jE@m-i@n, Pl jE@m-u@m
b. ya$˘- ‘go’ (unsuffixed Perfective of stem ya&˘-)
3Pl ya$˘-ba$, 2Pl ya$˘-be$
c. ya$˘-go@- ‘go’ (Imperfective Negative)
3Pl ya$˘-go@-ba@, 2Pl ya$˘-go@-be@This process does not apply to 3Pl -ba and 2Pl -be in the unsuffixed Imperfective. In this case, Tone-Grafting (131) has already provided these suffixes3.7 Tones119with a tone, by associating the L-tone (i.e. the segmentally zero morpheme
expressing the unsuffixed Imperfective) with the suffixal mora (stem-L-ba >
stem-ba$); see (130.a).
The spreading of stem-tones onto an atonal suffix has analogues involving
certain clause-final particles, such as conditional-antecedent particle dey ‘if’
(136.a-b), interrogative ma (136.c-d) and quotative wa (136.e-f); cf. §3.7.1.8,
above. The last two may combine, in the order ma wa (136.g-h). The tonal
markings of the final particles in (136) are based on the most common pronunciation in the absence of special intonational effects. Note that the particle(s)
carry forward the final tone of the preceding verb.

Quot120PhonologyClause-final particles other than Quotative wa are subject to intonational
modification (§3.8.1). dey occurs at the end of a conditional antecedent clause
that is immediately followed by its consequent clause. Interrogative ma
typically occurs in polar (yes/no) questions and is arguably identical to the ‘or’
conjunction ma, suggesting the possibility that questions like (136.c-d) are cutoff interrogative disjunctions: ‘Did he/she eat, or [didn’t he/she eat]’. These
contexts for dey and ma lend themselves to nonterminal clause-final intonation,
in the form of prolongation () and/or raising (), which disguise the
(phonological) tone.
A further complexity is that when two such clause-final particles co-occur,
they may form an autonomous prosodic unit independent of the preceding verb
(and its tones). For example, (136.g-h) show verb-final tones spreading from the
verb to both following particles, but in (136.g) it is also possible to raise the
pitch of both particles due to intonation effects. I transcribe this as e.g. n)a&˘
n)E@˘-jE$-Ø ma$ wa$ in the case of (136.g)
The ‘if’ particle dey systematically appears as H-toned de@ in the
combinations de@ ke@ and de@ ne$, regardless of the tone of the preceding
morpheme (§16.1.3).
Clause-final intonational effects can also apply to verbs ending in 3Pl -ba
and 2Pl -be (after they acquire a tone by Atonal-Morpheme Tone-Spreading) in
the absence of a following particle. Moreover, when they occur in all-L-toned
words, under some conditions they (and other pronominal suffixes) may “grow”
a final H-tone; see §3.7.3.6, just below.
Postposition le$ (instrumental, dative, locative) is normally L-toned (§8.2.1).
It has an H-toned variant le@ in certain fixed combinations, always involving a
preceding H-tone, suggesting that tone-spreading has applied in these combinations. However, in cases like do@ju$ ‘under’, do@ju@ le@ ‘down below’, the
preceding word itself raises its final tone. We therefore have a chicken-and-egg
conundrum, and the tonal pattern of do@ju@ le@ does not lend itself to a simple
phonological interpretation (§3.7.1.8, §8.2.2).
Likewise, there are three basically purposive clause types involving final le.
In one, we get H-toned le@ after tone-dropped verb, so there is clearly no tonespreading here (§17.6.1.1). In the other two, the tone of le is identical to that of
the preceding syllable. In one construction, the verb shifts to all-H tone, and is
followed by H-toned le@. In the other, we get L-toned le$ after an unsuffixed
Imperfective verb, which always ends in a L-toned component (final L or F
syllable). In these last two constructions, le acquires its tone by spreading from
the left (§17.6.1.2-3).
We could therefore take certain cases of le (but not others) to be
intrinsically atonal and subject to the tone-spreading process.","[139, 140, 141, 142]"

2004.3.14
There is evidently a three-way connection, at least historically, between this
sa^˘-Ø, quasi-verb sa$- ‘have’ (§11.5.1), and Resultative suffix -sa$- (§10.1.2.4).
All three are associated with the perfective aspectual system. Resultative suffix
-sa$- is a kind of perfective semantically, and is especially common before dey
‘if’. The quasi-verb sa$- ‘have’ is morphologically defective, appearing only in
the unsuffixed Perfective. This ‘have’ quasi-verb takes the F-toned form sa^- in
relative clauses, with H(H…)L contour overlaid as usual in the unsuffixed
Perfective. With Nonhuman Participial suffix -Ø, this participial sa^- appears as
sa^˘-Ø, with lengthened vowel after Contour-Tone Mora-Addition (141). Therefore the sa^˘-Ø in (906.a-c) is interpretable (in form) as a participle of sa$- with an
unexpressed Nonhuman head noun that has a sense like ‘time’ or ‘situation’.
The L-toned subject pronominal, such as 3Pl be$ in each of (906.a-c), is likewise
consistent with a participial (i.e. relative-clause) analysis. For similar combinations also involving a following de$y ’if’, see §16.1.2.
15.1.16 Chaining with linker ti@
A morpheme ti@ (probably related historically to Perfective suffix -ti -$ ) may be
inserted between chained verbs. Occasionally, it functions as the final verb in a
chain (in which case it takes suffixal inflections). I gloss it in interlinears as
“Link.”
In (907.a-e), ti@ links two verbs, and has no inflection of its own. As I
interpret the examples, the two relevant events are ordered chonologically. I
take this to be characteristic of ti@, which makes sense if it is related to the
Perfective verbal suffix. Three of the examples, namely (907.a-c), involve verb
da$ƒa@- ‘leave, abandon’ before ti@, though (907.a) and (907.b) are from the same
textual passage.

15.1.17 Chaining with ji@jE$ (or jE$) ‘go with’
The form ji@jE$, or reduced variant jE$, is used only with a following motion verb.
The combination is transitive-like, requiring a preceding NP as complement.
ji@jE$ is not a comitative postposition, since it can be separated from the logical
“complement” by an intervening chained verb. It must therefore either be taken
as a comitative adverb, signaling the presence earlier in the clause of a
complement in comitative function, or as a defective verb that occurs only as
nonfinal member of chains with a following motion verb. It is not verb-like in
form, since no verb has a bare stem (used in chaining) with HL tone contour.
Examples are in (910).

"6.3.3.2Adjectival intensifiersLike other languages of the zone (e.g. Fulfulde, montane Songhay languages),
Jamsay has a number of intensifiers that are used chiefly with adjectives,
especially in predicative function. They do not occur in my recorded texts, but
do occur in more lively conversation.
Most Jamsay intensifiers are frozen full-stem reduplications based on
CvC or CvCv “stems” that do not occur elsewhere. Nearly all are H-toned
throughout. An example is ku@ju@-ku@ju@, which is paired with jE@m ‘black’.
There are two constructions. In one, the semantically primary adjective
immediately precedes the intensifier and takes L-tones, i.e., it is tone-dropped
(351.a). The ‘be’ quasi-verb, if present, follows the intensifier. Here the
adjective and intensifier behave like any two modifying adjectives in sequence.
In the other construction, the ordering is the same but there is no tonal
interaction, and the ‘be’ quasi-verb is added directly to the primary adjective
(351.b). Here the intensifier patterns as a loosely attached adverbial.

other reduplicative intensifiers in its tonal pattern. It seems to have some
relationship with the adjective cE$tE@ applied to unusually short animal breeds.

intensifier is not in reduplicative form; I take it to be a crypto-compound ending
in a three-part reduplicative final. (355.b) is similar, but involves no
reduplication. In (355.c), the intensifier has interjection-like CvC form, though
in one case it can be reduplicated. ka@k is used in contexts like ‘he stopped still’
or ‘she stopped in her tracks’, emphasizing abrupt and total cessation of
movement.

"15.1.2 Verbal Noun of chained verbs
Verbal nouns may be created for tightly-knit verb chains. Only the final verb
has the VblN suffix. The preceding verbs appear as L-toned compound

There are a number of passages where chaining would have been easy for the
speaker, but where two adjacent verbs are each inflected. This is most common
with imperfective verbs. In (872.a), one could easily have gotten …la@ƒa@ cE^˘<-Ø
with a verb chain including la@ƒa@ ‘hit’ in bare-stem form. In (872.b) the same

While most nonfinal verbs in chains are morphologically bare, there are
infrequent examples in texts of chained verbs with an AN suffix (but, by
definition, without a pronominal-subject or Participial suffix). I include here
both direct chaining, and chaining with intervening me$y<. The AN categories in15.1 Chaining523question are Recent Perfect -jE$ indicating a chronological sequencing among
the chained verbs in (873.a-b) and (939.d), and Imperfective -tç@ƒç$ indicating
extended time overlap (873.b). If the Linker ti@ (§15.1.16) is equated with
Perfective suffix -ti -$ , many additional examples can be recognized.

A typical example extracted from a still longer chain is (874). Here each verb
(‘sling over shoulder’, ‘go’) is preceded by the arguments logically associated
with it. One can therefore easily bracket the VPs including their complements.

the last of which is in fully inflected form (with AN marking and a pronominalsubject suffix).

have been uttered. A complement such as a direct object may likewise be
omitted during the first one or two VPs, then appear overtly before a noninitial
(perhaps the final) verb of which it is a logical argument. In (877), note that
Nonhuman object pronominal ko@ is repeated (lines 1 and 4).
In (878), ‘milk’ is the logical object of ‘bring’, ‘put’, and ‘sell’, but it does
not appear until just before the final verb ‘sell’. This contrasts with e.g. (876.a),
above, where the direct object appears in the first eligible VP and is not
repeated.

In (879.a) a$na@ ‘village’, here in locative adverbial function, is more
naturally associated with ‘go around’ than with ‘blow (horn)’. However, it is
placed to the left of the two-verb sequence. In (879.b), the dative pronominal is
properly the argument of the second verb ‘speak’, but it is placed before the first
verb ‘go’. (879.c) has a similar structure, with ‘give’. These examples suggest
that two VPs in a chain have coalesced into one.

dative (=indirect) object of ‘show’. The speaker could therefore have used two
1Pl pronominals, an object form before ‘take’ and a dative form before ‘show’.
Instead, he used only the object form before ‘take’, correctly assuming that the
context was sufficiently clear. ‘Show’, like ‘give’, often omits an expected
Nonhuman direct object pronominal.

In some cases, the meanings of two chained verbs may blend together,
constituting the verbal equivalent of compounds.
One pair of examples, both involving kç@l-lç@- (Reversive derivative of kç@rç@‘hang up, hook’), is in (881). Here the second verb, ‘bring’ or ‘leave (in place)’,526Verb (VP) chaining and adverbial clausesclarifies the sense of the first verb as well as specifying motion (or lack thereof).
In one case, the suspended object is to be unhooked (and then brought). In the
other, the object has already been unhooked and is to be re-hung (and left
there); the logical sequence [unhook-(re)hang-leave] is boiled down to [unhookleave].

"6.2 Possessives6.2.3241Independent pronoun plus ma$ in subordinated clauseIn certain complex morphosyntactic constructions, instead of the usual simple
pronominal possessor (with alienable or inalienable noun), we get an
independent pronoun followed by Possessive ma$. We can tell that it is an
independent pronoun (H-toned), rather than an alienable possessor pronominal
(also H-toned), because the 1Sg form is mi@ ma$ (not ma@ ma$) and the 2Sg form
is u@ ma$ (not a@ ma$), these being the two pronominal categories that have distinct
forms as independent pronoun and as alienable possessor.
This pattern is observable in ‘before …’ clauses. There is a (pseudocausative) “verb” form with suffix -wv$, but this word is treated syntactically as
a noun. If just a subject, or just an object, is expressed, the relevant NP takes
(alienable) possessor form. When both a pronominal subject and any object
(pronominal or not) are expressed overtly, the result is normally of type (341),
with m a$ even after a pronominal subject, which takes independentpronoun form). (The form of the object NP or pronoun is not at issue in the
current section.) See (941-2) and discussion in §15.2.4.2.

"3.2.2Embryonic metrical structureMany languages have stress or accent systems, which generally have at least a
partially undulating, rhythmical nature (alternating stress rules, clash avoidance,
etc.). Jamsay is a tone language, whose tones are important both lexically and
grammatically. Unlike the case in other (non-Dogon) tone languages of the area,
in Jamsay there is no “tone sandhi” across word boundaries. In native
vocabulary, long words may consist entirely of metrically light, monomoraic Cv
syllables. For these reasons, there is no phonetically obvious metrical structure
of the sort we observe in English.
However, an embryonic metrical structure is manifested in various
phonological rules, particularly those applying to verb stems and their suffixal
derivatives (including Verbal Nouns). The core sequence involved is a steminitial bisyllabic [] foot behaving metrically as a trochee [sw], i.e., with a
metrically strong 1 followed by a weak 2. Squared brackets demarcate
metrical feet. Depending on the phonological process in question, there may be
further stipulations on one or both of these syllables (e.g. as to vowel length), or
a following third syllable may be required. There is no clear evidence for
metrical structure in the third, fourth, and fifth syllables of long, uncompounded
stems or words.
The phonological processes that are at least arguably sensitive to the initial
[sw] asymmetry are those in (28). For each, I give a brief summary (often
oversimplified) of the content of the process, name the morphological
categories affected, and a schematic representation of the relevant structure3.2 Internal phonological structure of stems and words27(with the targeted segment underlined). In the schemas,  is used for a syllable
that can be of any shape, i.e. initial (C)v(˘)C and noninitial Cv(˘)C, while more
specific representations like (C)v (optional C plus short vowel) are used when
the process requires.

f. Presuffixal V2-Raising (§3.5.2.2)
process: mid-height V2 {e E) or (o ç} raised to i or u
domain: suffixally derived verbs (e.g. causative)
relevant structure: [Cv]-[Cv-(28.a) is a consonantal lenition that occurs at the onset of 2 (but not e.g.
3). (28.b-e) are vocalic deletions and other lenitions. (28.b,d) are strictly
limited to 2, (28.c) is very strongly associated with 2 though it applies rarely
(in elicitation only) to later syllables; and (28.e) can apply equally to 2 or a
later syllable but there are very few opportunities for it to apply to a later
syllable. (28.f) is not obviously a lenition process, but since raising is associated28Phonologywith lenition in (28.e) one could make a case that (28.f) too is a lenition of sorts;
it applies only to 2.
The relevant structures in (28.a-f) are sufficiently divergent to show that no
fixed “underlying” metrical structure can account for all the data. 2 is always
centrally involved, but the lenitions are in some cases extended to immediately
following syllables. Only (28.a,d) affect stems of all word classes, while
(28.b-c, e-f) apply only to verb stems (including Verbal Nouns derived from
them).
If the metrical structure were better developed, one would expect some kind
of undulating stress, so that e.g. a five-syllable word would have an audible
organization into metrical feet, e.g. [sw][sw] (with extra-metrical final
syllable). This is not the case.
A probably related tone-lowering occurs in the second verb stem in certain
types of chains, including iterations (repetitions) of the same stem. This tonelowering applies at the level of words (or stems), not syllables. See §15.1.1 and
§16.6.2.","[48, 49, 50]"
"4.7.2.2Other ordinals (suffix -nE@)For numerals above ‘1’, ordinals are expressed by adding a suffix -nE@. The
preceding numeral (including composite numerals like ‘eleven’) drops to L-tone
within a level, but if there is a mix of levels (with elements from two or more of
the sets ‘1-99’, hundreds, thousands, and/or millions), tone-dropping does not
cross the phrasal boundary separating two levels. Thus tone-dropping affects the
simple numerals in (247.a-b,d), and the tripartite but single-level numeral in
(247.c), but it affects only the final part of the complex numeral in (247.e),
where ‘hundred’ retains its normal tone.

4.7.3Fractions and portionsThere are no terms denoting precise numerical fractions of the type ‘half’,
‘(one) third)’, and the like. The relevant sense is communicated pragmatically
by expressions based on a noun such as go@jo$ ‘part, division’ (of an object) or
ku$ru@ ‘(somebody’s) portion, share’, or the adjective ga$ma@ ‘certain (one(s)s, of

require tone-dropping on the noun (§6.1.4). This is suggestive of compounding,
since the initials in some noun-noun compound types also drop their tones. In
this section, I discuss phenomena that are more obviously compounds in nature.
A number of formulae for tone patterns are distinguished in the sections
below, using “x” for a compound initial of variable word-class, “a” for
adjective, “n” for noun, “v” for verb, and Ppl (as usual) for Participial suffix. A
macron (e.g. in “x#”) means that the constituent in question retains the same
tones that it has in isolation. A grave accent (“x$”) means that all tones in the
relevant constituent are dropped to low. An acute accent (“x@”) means that all
tones are raised to high, and a circumflex (“x^”) denotes an overlaid H(H…
… )L
stem-wide tone pattern.","[211, 212, 213]"
"2.2Inflectable verbs and quasi-verbsMost if not all Dogon languages are verb-final, and this is true of Jamsay.
However, the verb can be followed by clause-linking subordinators and certain
discourse particles like ‘only’ with clausal scope. In addition, some normally
preverbal constituents, especially adverbial phrases, are occasionally added (as
afterthoughts or clarifications) after the verb, with an intervening pause.
Verb stems must respect well-defined restrictions on segmental form and
lexical tones. Regular verbs end in a long vowel if monosyllabic, in a short
vowel if longer. The stem-level lexical tone pattern of a verb can only be all-H
or L(L…)H with H on the final mora.
In non-imperative, non-focalized main clauses, the verb has the basic
structure (2), omitting some details.
(2)[stem - (derivational suffix)] - aspect/negation - pronominal subjectBeginning with the final element, verbs are inflected for subject person and
number category (1Sg, 1Pl, 2Sg, 2Pl, 3Sg/Nonhuman, 3Pl); see §10.2. The
3Sg/Nonhuman suffix is -Ø. The pronominal subject suffix may be the only
expression of the subject, or it may agree with an unfocalized preverbal NP. In
the unsuffixed Imperfective (positive), Nonhuman subject is distinguished from
(human) 3Sg subject by adding quasi-verb kç$ ‘be (nonhuman)’ after the
regular verb stem.",[32]
"24Sketchd. (quasi-)focalization type
verb inflected for AN category but not for pronominal subject;
unsuffixed Perfective verb has all-L tones;
pronominal subject expressed by H-toned independent pronoun;
direct object not in possessor or compound-initial form.
examples:
focalization construction (chapter 13);
‘see’ complement in recognition sense (§17.3.4.2).
e. strong-nominalization type
verb is nominalized;
no AN categories expressed;
object expressed as compound initial or as alienable possessor;
subject expressed as alienable possessor if no object intervenes;
if object present, pronominal subject expressed as outer possessor
examples:
‘before …’ construction (§15.2.4.2);
Verbal Noun clause (§17.4).
f. compound type
object and verb are fused into a compound of type [n$ v^]
example:
reduced purposive clause in compound form (§17.6.3)3 Phonology3.1GeneralThe prosodic structure, involving tone patterns and vocalic lengthening, is
deeply intertwined with the morphosyntax. The segmental phonology has some
intricacies, but there are few disfiguring phonological processes that make it
difficult to identify stems and other morphemes in texts. Exception: PostSonorant Syncope (60) and the consonantal assimilation rules that it feeds can
disguise the identity of (C)vCv- words and stems. An example of this is bE$rE@‘get’, Perfective Negative bE$l-li@- (via Post-Sonorant Syncope (60) and Rhotic
Assimilation (77)). In examples in later chapters, I frequently list the full form
of lexical items disguised in this way in parentheses after the free translation.
There being no voiced bilabial or labiodental fricative v, I use the symbol
“v” for any short vowel, “v˘” for any long vowel, and uppercase “V” as the
unmarked symbol for any vowel (long or short). The symbol for “syllable” is .","[45, 46, 47]"
"3.7.2Grammatical tone patternsGrammatically controlled modifications of lexical tones are of two kinds: ToneGrafting (to the end of the stem), see (116), (118), and (131) below, and stemwide tone overlays. Grafting does not erase lexical tones, while overlays do.
There are many overlaid tone contours in Jamsay morphosyntax, while grafting
is limited to the tonal locative of nouns (§8.1) and to the unsuffixed Imperfective of verbs (§10.1.2.8).
Overlays themselves are of two kinds. In one, the overlay on the stem is
automatically triggered by a following suffix. In the other, the overlay is
controlled syntactically, though of course this too represents a kind of
dependence on the presence of other elements.
The beauty of the lexical tones, with at least one H-tone element in every
regular noun, verb, adjective, and numeral stem (§3.7.1), is that one can always
audibly express a morphosyntactic category by converting all tones in the stem
to L (tone-dropping). This happens systematically with nouns (before a modifying adjective or demonstrative, as head of relative clause, and as initial in
some compound types), adjectives and numerals (as final word in an NP that
heads a relative clause), pronouns (preverbal subject function, possessor with
inalienable kin terms, preceding some particles like Topic ke@), and verbs
(before Negative suffix, unsuffixed Perfective after focalized constituent).
There are other tone overlays, the most common being H(H…)L, which
occurs in the unsuffixed Perfective of verbs when used in relative clauses, in the
final of some nominal compounds, and in possessed forms of inalienable nouns.
There is an all-H overlay in imperatives of most CvCv- and Cv˘- verbs, and in
the final of some compounds.
It is no exaggeration to say that grammatical tone changes (along with
grammaticalized intonation) are the central motor of Jamsay morphosyntax.
Below is a brief summary of the grammatical tone processes applicable to
verbs, nouns, and other word-classes. It is followed by formulations of the
relevant grammatical tone processes. The section on tonology will conclude
with discussion of a number of low-level tone rules.",[125]
"19.3 Pragmatic adverbials or equivalents675Another alternative is an iteration of ci@n ‘thus’: ci@n-ci@n-ci@n-ci@n ‘and so

19.3.4 ‘In addition’ (ga$ra@-, do$go@-, pi@li@we@)
More expressions meaning ‘in addition to that’ are literally ‘if it goes beyond
that’ (1166.a) with verb na@˘-, ‘if it has passed that’ (1166.b) with verb ga$ra@-, or
‘if that is finished’ (1166.b) with verb do$go@-.

In (1166.b), the L-tone on ko$ shows that it is not a regular object pronominal. Perhaps it is an L-toned preverbal subject pronominal, or an unusual
case of demonstrative ko$ ‘that’ not modifying a following noun.
pi@li@we@- is a common verb meaning ‘return, go back’. As a nonfinal verb in
a chain, pi@li@we@ may usually be glossed ‘again’. However, it may be stretched
into a distinct adverbial sense close to ‘furthermore’. In (1167), I render it with
the English verb ‘proceed to’, suggesting a sequence of actions.

what happens with R-toned numerals like le&y ‘two’. The R-tone, however, is

(from Fulfulde) like la@yya@˘ru$ ‘Feast of the Ram’.
All verb stems of more than one syllable end in a short vowel in their basic
form. Nouns, adjectives, and other stems may end in a short or long vowel (or in
a consonant) regardless of the number of syllables, but final long vowels are
less common than final short vowels even for nouns and adjectives if the stem
has more than one syllable. Some noun stems with final long vowel are the
following (note that some can be analysed as initial Ci- reduplications, as
Cv˘-Cv˘ full-stem iterations, or as beginning with semi-segmentable a$-): di -$ dE@˘
‘shield’, li -$ lE&˘ ‘fear’, a@se^˘ ‘Saturday’ (ultimately Arabic), ba$˘bi^˘ ‘rubber
sandal’, bE$ru$-a$ji@˘ ‘billy-goat’, ba$lpç@˘ ‘calabash drum’, and bu$to@˘ ‘Mitragyna
tree’. Additional cases of final long oral vowel are created by morphonological
rules, e.g. Imperfective verbs (type yç$˘rç^˘ ‘will cook on fire’, from /yç$rç@-L/).
Monosyllabic stems, other than nouns and adjectives that end in a
consonant, have a shape Cv˘ with long vowel. All monosyllabic verbs are of this
type. Examples are the verbs ya&˘ ‘go’, dç&˘- ‘insult’, and ba@˘- ‘learn’, and the
nouns du@˘ ‘burden’, de&˘ ‘father’, and bE@˘ ‘excrement’. No short-voweled Cv
verb, noun, or adjective stems occur.
Word-final super-heavy syllables of the shape Cv˘C are attested but
somewhat uncommon. The final C is a sonorant (nasal, semivowel, or l), as in
a$-ce&˘N ‘agama lizard’. Many if not all of these cases involve historical loss of a
word-final high vowel, cf. ce$˘Nu@ ‘agama lizard’ in some other Dogon
languages. The same syllable type occurs on the surface in apocopated verbal
nouns of the shape Cv&˘C-Ø associated with Cv˘Cv- verbs whose final consonant
is one of the relevant sonorants, e.g. n)E@˘-w<E@- ‘feed’, VblN n)E&˘-w<-Ø ‘feeding’

given in (293.a-b). Also given are two fauna compounds used in hunters’ jargon
with a medial element -gç@-/-ga@-, describing gaits (293.c-d).
(293)a. jo@n-na@˘-jo@ru$ ‘blister beetle’ (Meloidae) (cf. jo@ru$ ‘blister’)

In the two insect terms (293.a), the initial has undergone Post-Sonorant
Syncope (60) and Rhotic Assimilation (77). The repeated element is
independently attested in one case (jo@ru$ ‘blister’), but not in the other (-so@ru$).
For iterative adjectival compounds of the type pE$y<-na$˘-pE&y< ‘very old’,
with L-toned initial and -na$˘-, see §5.1.14.
5.1.15 Instrumental relative compounds (‘oil for rubbing’)
The phrasal compounds in this section have the form of relative clauses (of
variable degree of frozenness) with impersonal 3Pl subject, an L-toned head
noun, and an unsuffixed Imperfective participle with Nonhuman Participial -Ø
suffix. The L-toned head noun often represents an instrument associated with
the activity, but there is no overt case-marking specifying instrumental or other
function. I will refer to it as the ‘oil for rubbing’ construction. An example is
(294).

second verb ‘put’ involves the instrument (baskets again), though admittedly
‘cut’ and ‘put’ refer to actions that are closely integrated. In other cases, a single
verbal idea is expressed by a two-verb sequence, as with the borrowed French
stem utiliser ‘use’ (not directly inflectable) plus inflectable ‘do’ in (296.c).
(296.c) also shows that a PP may be included in the ‘oil for rubbing’
construction.

argument, represented by the L-toned noun. However, the verb may have two
arguments, often a direct object (=patient) and an instrument, the latter being
the head. In this case, the direct object immediately precedes be$, and takes its
regular tones (i.e. it does not undergo tone-dropping). The instrumental head
noun N1 can be incorporated in either of two ways. First, it can be added in the
form [ma$ N1] after the remainder of the construction. This (uncommon)
construction is structurally equivalent to a “headless” relative clause followed
by [ma$ N1] containing the only occurrence of the head noun, a pattern attested,
but not very common, in other relative clauses; see (802) in (§14.1.1). The
second construction, considerably more common, is to prepose the instrumental
noun in L-toned form to the remainder of the construction, which can be
thought of as a postnominal modifier (i.e., an expanded adjective). This is
essentially just an expansion of the type illustrated above, with the extra direct
object noun following the L-toned head.
Both the instrumental [ma$ N1] add-on option, and the preposed L-toned
instrumental option, are exemplified in (297). This is from a longer passage
listing several earthenware (pottery) products made by women of the blacksmith
caste. The instrumental nouns are bolded in the interlinears.

The [ma$ N1] extension is (rarely) also used when there is only one NP

describing various items that must be offered to the bride at the time she is
ceremonially transferred (in a large and boisterous parade) from her own home
to her husband’s. The final ‘oil for rubbing’ is straightforward, but it is preceded
by a much more complex instance of the construction.

‘You-Pl will take a garment for covering her on her head with a white

(‘a garment for covering her’), the phrase headed by ‘(white) garment’ is
elaborated by chaining the VP ending in ‘cover’ with a second VP denoting the218Nominal and adjectival compoundstransfer of the bride. The 3Sg pronominal denoting the bride, who is the logical
object of ‘cover’ as well as of ‘take (=convey)’, is expressed only in the ‘take’
VP. This gives us a schematic pattern (301) for the relevant part of (300).
(301)[[on her head] [garment.L white.L] they.L cover and]
[as-newlywed her they.L transfer.Impf]The two cases of L-toned preverbal 3Pl subject be$ in this part of the
construction are arguably of different natures referentially. The first, following
‘white garment’, is the impersonal and invariant 3Pl mentioned above, while the
second is perhaps a regular 3Pl pronoun referring to the people accompanying
the bride in the parade.
(301) is then complicated further by adding a [ma$ NP] phrase, with
Possessive ma$ plus a repeat of the NP functioning as head of the relative (here,
‘white garment’, simplified to ‘garment’). Such head repetition is common in
relative clauses, but all my other examples of the [ma$ NP] add-on involve just
an unmodified noun following ma$ (§14.1.1). The expected form of the add-on
in (300) would therefore have been just ma$ yi $ru@ with the noun ‘garment’.
However, the speaker elaborated this by including repetitions of 3Pl subject be$,
the verb go$ro@- ‘cover’ (now in unsuffixed Imperfective rather than chained
bare-stem form), and Definite ku$<. The final structure as seen in (300) is
therefore (302), where the two occurrences of the head are bolded.

of [garment.L they.L cover-Impf]Though productive and expandible, as the last example shows, the
construction lends itself to lexicalization, since it often denotes a common
implement or container. In some cases, it seems best to write the combination as
a single hyphenated word. For example, (303.a) could be parsed literally as
‘heart for fighting a fight (with)’, but has a lexicalized sense denoting a
personality trait. ‘Slingshot’ (303.b) contains 3Pl subject be$ and unmarked
Imperfective ta^˘<- ‘shoot’; the initial is ma@na$, whose basic sense is ‘plastic’,
most often referring to the lightweight shopping bags found in markets, though
it can also mean ‘slingshot’.

Phrases and sentences, sometimes morphologically reduced, can be used as
nouns. Some examples follow.
E$˘-mi@-te@˘re@ ‘time when millet begins to develop ears’ is from E@- ‘see’, 1Sg
mi@, and te@˘re@- ‘show’. The “syntax” here is somewhat opaque, but it can be
taken to have a literal meaning ‘see (it) and show (it) to me’. It reflects the
curiosity among Jamsay farmers as to the timing of the first appearance of
millet ears (seed spikes) during the growing season. Of course the ears appear
first in a few plants within a field, and in one field before another field, so there
is much interest in the first reports of ear development.","[234, 235, 236, 237, 238, 239, 240, 241]"
"15possessor NP followed by ma$ ‘of’, or simple pronoun as possessor
noun stem
adjective (simple or expanded)
demonstrative or ‘each, any’ quantifier
numeral, Pl particle, and/or Definite particle
‘all’The noun stem itself may be a compound. Many human nouns, and
adjectives when referring to a human, take the suffix Sg -n or Pl -m. Human
nouns that for one reason or another cannot take these suffixes (e.g. most kin
terms) may be followed by Pl particle be@. Nonhuman nouns lack morphological
number marking, but they can be followed by be@ to emphasize plurality.
An example of a fairly complex NP is (10), with the head bolded in the
interlinear. It consists of a possessor, a head noun, two modifying adjectives,
and a Pl morpheme. ‘House’ and ‘small’ undergo tone-dropping to all L-tones
(indicated by “.L” in interlinears) because each is followed by a modifying
adjective. The possessor (1Sg) and the final Pl morpheme be@ do not interact
tonally with the head noun or with the adjectives. One can therefore bracket off
an inner core NP defined by tonal interaction, as opposed to peripheral
elements that have no tonal interaction with the core (tonal independence).

numerals, which do not interact tonally with preceding nouns and adjectives
(§6.5), and inalienable possessors for kin terms, which force a tone overlay on
the kin term itself (§6.2.2).
In addition to tonal dependence versus independence, a further issue
relevant to internal NP structure is what happens when a multi-word NP
functions as head of a relative. For example, if (10) is a relative head, as in (11)
below, its first four words remain together (though pi@ru@ drops tones to become
pi r$ u$), but Plural be@ detaches itself and appears at the end of the relative clause,
following the participialized verb (and, usually, Definite ku$<).

such detachability and the lack of tonal interaction when adjacent. However,16Sketchthe correlation is imperfect; for example, cardinal numerals have no tonal
interaction with preceding nouns, but are not detachable.
Pronominal categories are 1Sg, 1Pl, 2Sg, 2Pl, 3Sg (human), 3Pl (human),
and Nonhuman. They are expressed as subject-pronominal suffixes on verbs
(with 3Sg and Nonhuman merged as zero in most AN categories), as procliticlike particles preceding verbs or postpositions, and as independent pronominals.

noun-like morpheme E$nE@ (plural E$nE@ be@) that is used both for third person
reflexive possessor (‘he killed his own dog’, §18.1.2) and, in third-person

17.5.3 ‘Help’ (ba$ra@-)
ba$ra@- has a range of senses including ‘help’, ‘gather’, and ‘add, increase’. In the
sense ‘help’, the simple construction is transitive [X help Y] where Y is the
person or entity helped, see line 1 of (1079). The maximal structure is
approximately [X help Y [Y VP]], where Y potentially appears as upper-clause
direct object and as lower-clause subject. In my data, Y is not repeated.
In the most basic construction, the upper and lower verbs fuse into a serial
combination (a kind of compound verb) that can take two direct objects, one the
object of ‘help’, the other the object governed by the lower verb. One might
expect the linear ordering [[sack carry] him I-helped] for ‘I helped him carry the
sack’, but instead we get [sack him carry I-helped] with the two objects to the
left and the two verbs bunched at the right.
