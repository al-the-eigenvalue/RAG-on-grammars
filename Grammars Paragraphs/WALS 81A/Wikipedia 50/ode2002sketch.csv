Subject prefixation for person and number on verbs (see §3) is obligatory only with human
subjects, but note that (mi)nton 'child ', mamir 'person ', nkan 'old person ' , mampu
'youngster', maunbwat 'thief' etc. do not trigger subject prefixation if the speaker does not
know the gender. The word order in verbal clauses is SVO.","[9, 10]"
"6.8 Nouns and word order
Word order in noun phrases is as follows: P�S + N + A + NUM + DET, as in:(78)A-onsraa-hijanmafun3SM-like 3SM-possess house beautiful
He likes his many beautiful houses.fon.
many64Cecilia OdeA modifying relative clause (see § 1 5) is normally introduced by the relative marker ma,
occupying the position of the postnominal modifiers. I n the following example, a nominal
predication is presented followed by a negation which obligatorily follows the nominal
predicate:(79)Iwma-n-kakokorjan.bird REL-3SF-that chicken NEG
This bird is not a chicken.","[19, 20]"
"12 Conjunctions
There are simple (aka 'and then', 'so') and complex (na toka 'in order to') conjunctions
that link clauses. For example:(2 1 3)An-unsi bain-eaka an-detbar-(d)et!",[36]
"4.2 Transitive and intransitive verbs
Transitive verbs can, but need not always, have an object, whereas intransitive verbs
cannot have a direct object, but can have an object with a preposition.
The verb det 'to eat' is an example of a transitive verb and requires at least the object bar
'thing' :(20)An-det bar-(d)etpa-e?",[10]
"6 Nouns
Nouns are of the following types: simple nouns, compounds, alienable and inalienable
nouns. Nouns referring to human beings are marked for gender. Nouns have possessive
inflection by means of bound pronouns prefixed to inalienable nouns and by means of the
subject prefixed verb tar or bi 'to possess' preceding the alienable noun. Nouns as head of
noun phrases can be modified by adjectives, numerals and demonstratives following the
noun. Loans are predominantly from neighbouring languages: Numforese, Irianese Malay or
Standard Indonesian, but also from Dutch. Since loans do not behave differently from
original Mpur words, they will not be further discussed.",[16]

"9 Prepositions
Prepositions in Mpur have no subject prefixation. For the purpose of this exposition,
prepositions are subdivided into three types: ( 1 ) referring to space, (2) referring to space with
an aspectual meaning, and (3) non-spatial prepositions. Such a subdivision may not be
tenable, since the preposition na 'for, to', mainly used with verbs like 'say' and 'give', also
occurs with demonstratives. Some prepositions also occur as verbs (see below). The
discussion of locative prepositions be andfe is delayed till §1 0.

1.1 Background of the Mpur language
Mpur is a Non-Austronesian language with three lexical tones and is spoken by
approximately 5 ,000 speakers in the north east Bird's Head area, Irian Jaya, Indonesia. In
the literature Mpur is sometimes referred to as Kebar or Amberbaken, which are geographic
names for the two regions where it is spoken.
Mpur is a phylum-level isolate with dialectal differences in at least lexicon and prosody
between speakers in the Kebar Valley, in the mountains (East Kebar) and on the coast
(Amberbaken), respectively. The lexicon is of Papuan origin, but morphology and syntax
show Austronesian features (Reesink 1 998 :603ff.), such as subject-verb-object word order
and the absence of heavy verb morphology. Many loans entered Mpur from Numforese,
Irianese Malay, Standard Indonesian, and also some from Dutch. I ndonesian is taught in
village schools by non-Mpur teachers, but they play truant as much as Mpur children do. In
town Mpur children learn I ndonesian more properly and only they are fairly able to
distinguish between Indonesian and Mpur words. Only a few Mpur speakers are literate in
Mpur, though much progress has been made in Kebar since G. and C. Kalmbacher (Irian Jaya
Bethany Foundation and Summer Institute of Linguistics) began to give literacy courses with
educational materials in the villages of that area; literacy in Indonesian is much better.
Speakers of Mpur do not know the origin of the name Mpur. Coastal Mpur speakers refer
to Mpur speakers in the Kebar Valley as ma-ye 'who are outside' (lit. REL-outside), that is, at
the other side of the eastern Tamrau mountains. Kebar people call Papuan people maksam,
most likely from mam-kesam 'person from Irian' (lit. person-big.forest), in contrast to matem
'white people' from mam-war-tem 'person-mouth-river'. So far I have no explanation for the
term Mpur which is only used to refer to the language.
The Mpur-speaking community has been extensively described by Miedema ( 1 9 84) and
many examples of their oral tradition have been published in M iedema ( 1 997). The story
Kaman ja 'Squash seeds', for the first time presented in this article, is an old story but a new
item to Miedema's collection.","[1, 2, 3]"
"4.3 Verb sequences
Sequences of verbs are a common phenomenon in Mpur. They occur without any
conjunction and all verbs in such a sequence are finite and thus obligatorily inflected.
There are a few criteria according to which sequences of verbs in Mpur actually could be
cases of verb serialisation: conjunctions do not occur between the verbs, a clause boundary
occurs only after the last verb, the subject is the same for all verbs, verbs may also occur
individually in a clause, verbs form together a prosodic group (no pauses between verbs, a
single intonation contour). Three examples are:(27)Do-undo-mimdo-fasubweAri-a a-tem.",[11]
"3SM-child-CL CLF-two 3PL-wait impossible 3PL-wait impossible already
His two children could not wait, they could not wait anymore.
As the following example shows, Mpur words from other word classes can be used as a
verb without the verbaliser bi- simply by taking subject prefixation:
(33)kum smokede-kum-athey smoke him4. 5 Causative verbal prefix faMpur makes use of a verbal prefix, which is most likely of Numforese origin indicating a
causative, for instance fa-ur 'to extinguish' consisting of the causative fa- and the adverb ur
'extinguished'. Fa- can be prefixed to words from different word classes making it a
transitive verb. Some examples are:A sketch of Mpur 57
(34)yep
dubun
bum
jik
brekdry

fog, cloud
to kill

fa-rubun
fa-bum
fa-ji(k)-em
fa-brekto dry
to pull out
to hide
to argue (lit. cAus-kill-RECIP)
to turn around, to capsizeIn a number of cases I do not know the origin of the stem of the transitive verb, for
instance fa-wop 'to close'. Note that Taba (South Halmahera) has ha-op CAUS-be covered 'to
cover' (John Bowden, pers. comm.). Some verbs like farkor 'to learn' and f(a)nander 'to
forget' are wholesale borrowings from Numforese (note that the vowel a of fa- is often
omitted).","[12, 13]"
"(5 1 )An-unjan pal2SG-go not
Don't go !already5 Adjectives
There are reasons for positing a separate word class of adjectives distinct from either
verbs or nouns, although Mpur adjectives do have some similarities with Mpur verbs. Both
verbs and adjectives take subject prefixation in predicative position. In attributive position
verbs require the relativiser ma following the noun and preceding the prefixed verb.
Adjectives in attributive position occur with and without the relativiser mao
Some examples of adjectives, including the five terms for colours, are:(52)bapak

bitter, spicy
black60Cecilia OdeNote that there are three more names for yellow: minam (in the mountains also used for
white), dapraw and bwa-bin (lit. ripe-leaf). Colours can be further specified by using the
adverbs dera or pit 'bright' which are only used for colours and by berep 'light' and dim
'dark', which all follow the name of the colour. The word for azure, for instance, is bwawop
dera 'bright green ' and the word for 'pink' is sum berep. To indicate the intensity of a
colour, the adverbs ten 'just' and tati, kaku 'very' are used: sum ten 'reddish', sum tati 'very
red'.
Adjectives follow the noun and can be specified with relative marker ma as shown in (53).
The relative marker ma occurs on attributive adjectives as in (53), but also introduces relative
clauses and occurs as relative marker in Headless RC. For a further discussion of ma see§1 5.

"14 Classifiers
Mpur has a large number of classifiers that are obligatory in combination with numerals
which they precede. Though I don't know their exact number, I found over twenty different
classifiers. For example, bik for counting houses andfi for counting persons and animals:(226)janbikdenurhouse CLF three
three houses(227)ntonfirokir
fi-dokirchild CLF-two
two children84Cecilia Ode
Other examples of classifiers are:

urlong objects, such as sticks, poles
large-sized area
cutting tool
seed, stone, grain, small round object
for bananas (and other short-sized objects)

'short-sized object' , as compared in:
(23 1 )fatapmarnbrokirvsbanana MEAS seven
seven hands of bananasfasum marnbrokirbanana CLF seven
seven (separate) bananasSome classifiers can also be found as a noun, for instance bik 'bamboo', or as a member
of a compound, for instance ja in:

testicles1 5 Relativisation and the form ma
The form rna is observed in various languages of the Bird's Head area. Reesink
( 1 998:626ff.) discusses the different functions of mao To supplement his article I present
some other functions which rna has in Mpur, in addition to sections 7- 1 0 where the form has
also been discussed.
My informants indicated that preposition rna 'at, to' and ma as relative marker have
different tones: high tone and mid tone, respectively. I analysed many examples of rna and
found that in both functions the tone realised in context fluctuates considerably; pronounced
in isolation I did not find any difference in tone: both were realised with mid tone. The form
is so frequently used, that a discrete difference in tone would have been noticed.
For the time being, the different rna, which, in spite of native speakers' judgements, are
considered homophonous, to be distinguished are:
(a)as relative marker, introducing relative clauses;(b)as relative marker in Headless RC, resembling a nominalising particle;(c)on attributive adjectives in RC;A sketch ofMpur
(d)as marking demonstratives;(e)in question words (examples (244}-(246));(f)as preposition (example (247)).","[39, 40, 41]"
"4.9 Quote marker bwa
In running speech the verb bwar 'to say' can be used as quote marker. Final -r is often
omitted, final -a can be (sometimes extremely) lengthened, and the verb keeps its subject
prefixation. Examples are:A sketch of Mpur
(47)Kamanbwar59na Sasua bwa ...pumpkin say
to Sasua QUOT
The pumpkin said to Sa sua, he said . . .","[14, 15]"
"Cecilia Ode523 Pronouns
3.1 Free and bound pronouns
Mpur has free and bound pronouns. Bound pronouns are subject markers prefixed on
verbs and possessor markers prefixed on inalienable nouns. The free and bound forms are
presented below with an example on a prefixed verb and on an inalienable noun:

HE will go home.
(3)Ntonjan.
housenan an-jap.child 2S0 2S0-stay

Personal free pronouns are used as verbal or prepositional object, without special
emphasis, as in (4) and (5):
(4)A -fromnan.","[7, 8]"
"The adverbfanam also occurs as verb and takes subject prefixation:(1 72)do-bwanjar per.

Adverbs of location follow the predicate with(out) object and indicate where the action
expressed by the verb takes place. For instance:(171)bwaner.
A-jap
3SM-live far
He lives far away.",[31]
"2 Phonology
Mpur is a language with lexical tone contrasts. To my knowledge it is, together with the
neighbouring Abun language (Berry & Berry 1 999), the only Non-Austronesian tone
language in the Bird's Head area.
A detailed phonology of Mpur by G. Kalmbacher is in preparation, of which a draft
(Kalmbacher 1 996) was kindly offered to me by the author. The data presented here do not
necessarily agree with all data in Kalmbacher's phonology. This is especially the case with
respect to word stress and the tone system, but differences will not be discussed. Full
responsibility for this short phonology is mine.",[4]

Content questions occur with specific question words some of which have the question
marker -e. Question words usually occur in the same syntactic position as the element they

Adverbs of mode tend to occur clause-finally, at least post-predicate, following the object

"48Cecilia Ode1 .2 A personal note
The present article is a sketch of Mpur. The main aim of my research was an experimental
phonetic study of prosody in Bird's Head languages, more specifically of Mpur and Abun.
Because of the time-consuming character of such studies, morphology and syntactics did not
get the attention it deserved. A description of Abun has recently been published (Berry &
Berry 1 999), but Mpur is still mostly a blank spot on the language map of the Bird's Head.
A phonology (Kalmbacher 1 996, MS), a limited wordlist and some other works have been
written by G. and C. Kalmbacher. Though a full description of the Mpur language was never
my intention, I nevertheless collected enough data to undertake the challenge of writing this
article, largely encouraged to do so by my fellow researchers. Yet quite a few issues remain
insufficiently described or explained, and in some cases that is even an understatement.
H owever, since I do have quite a bit of data from the language and since it is unlikely that
anyone else will study the language in detail soon, I have decided to present an analysis of
what I have collected so that the language will not remain completely undocumented except
for its phonetics.
Data for this article were collected during three periods of fieldwork in 1 99 3-94, 1 995
and 1 998 in the Kebar valley and in Amberbaken. Apart from the work by G. and C.
Ka1mbacher mentioned above, which became accessible to me only later, no data on the
Mpur language were available. I worked intensively with Amanda Ajoi and Seppy Wabia in
Anjai, the Kebar Valley, and in Saukorem, Amberbaken, with Seppy Wabia, Markus Wabia,
Moses Warijo and a few other people. Twice I met the Kalmbachers in Kebar and discussed
many Mpur issues with them. For a study of the three dialects I visited lenderau (East
Kebar) and Nekori (over the mountains behind Jenderau) and along the Amberbaken coast
the villages from Arfu to Wau. In all areas mentioned I worked with indigenous inhabitants
of the villages and recorded their speech on tape.
This article reflects the limitations explained above and will mainly present word classes,
morphological processes and, where this seems adequate, some syntactic information.","[3, 4]"
"2.4 Stress
In polysyllabic words, a syllable can be more prominent than its surrounding syllables,
especially if it has high tone or a relatively longer duration. Yet there is no evidence that
lexical stress in Mpur is phonologically significant. In a pilot experiment conducted in the
field, I observed that no regular pattern of realised prominence of syllables exists. In
different contexts one and the same word may even show shifting prominence without
expressing a contrast.",[7]
"1 1.8 To be or be not: the presentative mu
The presence or existence of something is expressed by the presentative mu with verbs like
ut 'to stay', i 'to stand', jap 'to sit' or kon 'to lie, sleep'. The word class it belongs to is not80Cecilia Odeclear to me, so for the time being the presentative is discussed in this final section on adverbs.
The most frequent use is in combination with the verb ut 'to stay' forming the compound
construction umu and with the demonstratives ka 'that.there' and ki 'that.here'. Mu is always
preceded by a verb. Though its use is not yet clear to me, the presentative is shown in a few
examples:(205)pa.mu-kia-IFentor-aFentor-3SM 3SM-stand present-here already
Fentori is here already.","[35, 36]"

Clitic -a attached to the final word of an utterance or to a name as a vocative (see also

speaking becomes almost calling, as for example in:
(26 1 )Nenwar mbana-y-a.mama lDU I SG-here-Y-CL

Furthermore, clitic -a is used in enumerations of objects or events which can all take -a,

'already'. For 'month' the form man is used from the Dutch loan maand.",[32]
"( 1 49)nton braw per

In addition to the rather general locative prepositions, discussed in §9, Mpur employs a
number of spatial relator nouns to specify the spatial orientation of an object. Some of these
are clearly nouns in their own right, such as bwan 'hole', others transparently refer to body
parts, such as dir 'rib', again others can be classified as nouns, because they occur as object
of the preposition be. This preposition has not been discussed in §7, since it is rather
restricted to locative phrases with or without spatial nouns. Some spatial nouns are included
in this category on the basis of analogy to the items mentioned. That is, if a noun referring to
an object which serves as spatial anchoring point is present, the spatial nouns either followA sketch ofMpur 73
that noun directly, as in (1 50), or with an additional instance of the preposition be, as in( 1 5 1 ).

"3.2 Reflexivity
Reflexivity is expressed by means of free pronouns. It can be emphasised by do 'self,

"Anja16 Clitics
Clitics are monosyllabic morphemes attached to lexical words of different classes, but
usually not on prepositions. Clitics are meaningful elements and in Mpur frequently have a
salient intonation and syllable lengthening. All clitics are enclitics which modify a word, a
clause or a whole utterance. The interrogative clitic -e is discussed separately in §7. The
same form is used with an apparently different function. The other clitics -a, -i, -0 function
in discourse as, for instance, vocatives, continuation, focus and temporal markers, as
expression of (emotive) emphasis. It is hard to tell the different meanings of the clitics apart,
and I did not study the issue thoroughly enough to explain the differences. Working on the
translations of texts, Mpur informants were often unable to indicate what a given clitic
means. Despite this some examples are presented below.
Clitic -a occurs as a vocative for persons: nen-a! 'Mum-voc!'. It is used to call someone
who is not far away (otherwise -0 is used, see below):A sketch of Mpur 87

"1 5.2 Other uses of the form rna
The form rna is also used in question words, as shown in (244H246):(244)Maria-nrna-n ?n-yenMaria-3SF 3SF-mother who- 3SF
Who is Maria's mother?",[42]
"2.2 Syllable structure and phonotactics
The syllable structure in monosyllabic words is as follows:50Cecilia Ode
v
CV
VC
CVCpa
am
kurto stand
already
eye
snakeConsonant clusters do not occur in syllable-final position and are rare in syllable-initial
position, except C + semivowel. One can even question whether initial consonant clusters are
in fact the result of vowel elision, as, for example, in from 'think ', and thus not
monosyllables.
In polysyllabic words, consonant and vowel clusters occur over syllable boundaries:v-v
CV-V
V-VC
CV-VC
CCV-VC
CVC-CVC
V-VC-CVCa-i
ma-u
e-un
ba-um
kwa-ik
ben-kan

wrongSequences of consonants and vowels, also over syllable or morpheme boundaries, are
subject to complex rules of constraints. As stated earlier, I will not go into details.","[5, 6]"

"3SM-ANAIt remains unclear whether sequences of verbs in Mpur are serial verb constructions or
coordinate constructions. I did not study the issue and a detailed discussion is also beyond the
scope of the present article.",[12]
"4.4 Verbaliser biThe prefix bi- can be used for loans or words of other word classes to change the item into
a verb. For example:
(30)bi-rekam
bi-paksa
bijadi
bijadi ntan
bi-hanyat
bi-lewat
bi-undang
bi-skap
bi-ankar
bi-sik
bi-aka

to force (from Indonesian paksa)
to appear (from Indonesianjadi)
to give birth to (from Indonesian jadi)
to float (from Indonesian hanyat)
to cross (from Indonesian lewat)
to invite (from Indonesian undang)
to kick, hit (from Dutch schoppen)
to lie, to deceive (from NF ankar 'to deceive')
to be unable (from Mpur adverb sik 'not.possible')
to make possible (from Mpur conjunction aka 'so')
to be funny, humorous (from Mpur sum 'spicy'?)On Mpur words, the verbaliser bi- is not always obligatory. Compare the following two
examples:
(3 1 )Aka men bani n-kon-epa.m-bi-sikthen 3SF that 3SF-sleep-CL 3sF-VBL-impossible already
And then she was asleep, there was nothing more she could do.

"A sketch of Mpur55Verbs like minsa 'to hunt', nkwan 'to cook ', din 'to play' and dokwa 'to carry' are also
transitive and cannot occur without an object, unless the latter is easily recovered from the
context:(2 1 )N-nkwansukwan.","[10, 11]"
"4.7 Emotive verbs with waThere are a number of verbs expressing mental or physiological states with the initial
syllable wa-, mostly for negative feelings such as warmor 'to be angry', wanaw 'to be afraid',
wafnem 'to be lazy', waka 'to be jealous', wamar 'to be tired', wandar 'to be shy', wantek 'to
be ill '. The verb mom (see §4.6) also occurs with wa-: wamom 'to want not'. I have no
explanation yet for the origin of wa-. According to my language consultants the form wa
comes from wow 'body' or mwan 'face, appearance', for instance: wamar 'to be tired'
consists of wow-mar 'body-tired', wantek 'to be ill ' is claimed to be mwan-tek 'face-hot'.

"4.1 Simple and compound verbs
Simple verbs are verbs consisting of one single stem, for instance bot 'to take, fetch' (also:
'to give' in conjunction with the preposition na 'to'). Compound verbs are verbs that consist
of a combination of two verbs, for instance unot 'to know' which is made up of the two verbs
un 'go' and wot 'see'; berto 'tell' from ber 'talk ' and dito 'tell '; konot 'dream' from kon
'sleep' and wot 'see'.

"2.5 Intonation
Some intonation patterns have been dealt with in Ode ( 1 996, 1 997). A description of
Mpur tones and intonation is still in progress and will be published separately. For the time
being only some limited notes on intonation are presented.
A general tendency is observed to realise large pitch movements at prosodic boundaries (a
pause, silence, hesitation, reset), for which the final syllable is then lengthened. At the end of
declaratives pitch usually moves downwards. Interrogatives and continuations cannot be
expressed by intonation alone: interrogatives take question markers (§8) which have their
'own' tones, and enclitics are used to express a continuation (§ 1 6). The importance of a word
in an utterance, as a means of accent, is highlighted by focus marker ni (see §7), by enclitics
or by repeating words (of most word classes), examples of which can be found in the text at
the end of this article. Enclitics especially have salient falling or rising pitch movements.
The expression of emotive emphasis has been described in Ode ( 1 997, 1 998).",[7]
